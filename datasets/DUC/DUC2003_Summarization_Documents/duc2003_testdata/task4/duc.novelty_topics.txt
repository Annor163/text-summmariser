<title> Most Dangerous Vehicles 

<desc> Description: 
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, 
passenger vehicles?
 
<desc2> Description:
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, passenger 
vehicles?


<narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain information on the 
crashworthiness of a given vehicle or vehicles that 
can be used to draw a comparison with other vehicles.  
The document will have to describe/compare vehicles, 
not drivers.  For instance, it should be expected 
that vehicles preferred by 16-25 year-olds would be 
involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of
crashes per 100,000 miles, for example.
