<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="8" NOVEL> The city of Los Angeles has won permission from a state water board to begin trucking tons of sewage sludge to the Antelope Valley for use as farmland fertilizer, an environmentally controversial ruling that could open the door to more such uses in the county.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="9" NOVEL> The 7-1 decision by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board was a major victory for the city, which is seeking a cheaper and closer-to-home alternative for some of the sludge it has been trucking to farm fields in Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="10" NOVEL> The decision is final unless there is an appeal within 30 days.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="11" NOVEL> The ruling marks the first time land application of wet sewage sludge has been permitted in the fast-growing Antelope Valley, and one of only a few times it has been permitted anywhere in Los Angeles County, although the practice is more common elsewhere in the country.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="14" NOVEL> Under the permit, Bio Gro Systems Inc. -- a private company that has the contract to transport the city's sludge -- will truck an average of 80 to 100 tons a day of the city's concentrated sewage to the Antelope Valley.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="22" NOVEL> She said sludge will improve crop yields and reduce the need for scarce water, harmful pesticides and commercial fertilizer.</s>

<s docid="LA051290-0103" num="23" NOVEL> Under the water board's action, the city and Bio Gro will be required to conduct extensive water and soil sampling, and crops grown with the sludge cannot be used for human consumption.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="86" NOVEL> Over a period of two months, two times less organic fertilizer was delivered to the fields than during the same period for last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="87" NOVEL> Thus we recommend the use of farmyard manure for vegetables and potatoes and also in farm crop rotation plans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="88" NOVEL> Applications of low dosages of fresh unprepared farmyard manure in field crop rotation plans must also be eliminated and it must not be removed from manure piles by bulldozers and toothless drag harrows, since this leads to strong contamination of the crops, lodging and irregular ripening and also to an excessive accumulation of nitrates in the products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11780" num="32" NOVEL> Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 March reports that rice, cane, and other crops in Sancti Spiritus Province this year will receive some 70,000 tons of organic fertilizers known as bioearth [bio-tierra] to replace the imported chemical products.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="9" NOVEL> The first load of sewage sludge to be trucked into the Antelope Valley from Los Angeles was used as fertilizer on a remote farm Wednesday, giving the area a preview of a larger program that may soon get under way.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="10" NOVEL> In a special demonstration for a visiting Environmental Protection Agency official, the city spread about 20 tons of the concentrated waste material.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="11" NOVEL> Within two months, Los Angeles could begin exporting up to 100 tons a day to the site.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="12" NOVEL> The demonstration had two glitches.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="13" NOVEL> There was a dispute over who asked for the demonstration, and state water board officials said they were surprised by the offensive smell.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="25" NOVEL> As it lay on the ground in a heap, the sludge had only a mild fertilizer smell.</s>

<s docid="LA072690-0138" num="26" NOVEL> But once the spreader flung it into the air, a foul smell spread over the farm.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="10" NOVEL> The tractor slowly drove up and down the rows of an abandoned field, plunging metal prongs about a foot into the ground to inject the fecal-smelling, mudlike byproduct of human waste.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="11" NOVEL> This use of treated sewage as fertilizer is the first local attempt by Los Angeles to prove that something good can grow from efforts to get rid of a foul problem.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="12" NOVEL> Under a program nearly two years in development, the city began trucking up to 100 tons a day of its sewage sludge to a farm about 10 miles west of Lancaster, where a city-hired contractor plans to use the waste as fertilizer for alfalfa and sod.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="13" NOVEL> The thick sludge is the remnant of human waste and other sewage that has undergone a complex treatment process.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="14" NOVEL> Health officials will not allow it to be used as fertilizer on crops grown for human consumption.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="15"> The program marks the first time Los Angeles has applied its sludge to land within the county.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="16" NOVEL> Although the city's main goal is to dispose of its waste, officials said that sludge can benefit agriculture and help farms cut their water use by serving as a kind of mulch.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="17" NOVEL> Also, the city, which has been trucking sludge to farms in Arizona, hopes to cut its costs by not shipping it so far.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="18" NOVEL> Officials hope that keeping the sludge within the county, rather than hauling it far away, will show residents that the waste can be safely reused.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="19" NOVEL> The first three 25-ton truckloads made the 90-mile trip without incident from the city's main Hyperion sewage treatment plant in El Segundo to Antelope Valley.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="20" NOVEL> Once there, the sludge in the trucks is mixed with water to flow more easily and is pumped into a spreading tank.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="28" NOVEL> In an attempt to avoid complaints even in the remote farm area, Bio Gro abandoned its earlier plan to spread the sludge on the surface of the soil, where it has a stronger fecal smell and could be blown in high winds.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0078" num="29" NOVEL> The firm opted to use a tank truck to inject it underground.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="56" NOVEL> According to incomplete statistics, 59 percent of China's arable land is phosphorus deficient, 23 percent lacks potassium, and 14 percent is lacking phosphorus and potassium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="58" NOVEL> The use of chemical fertilizers is increasing and many farmers are overlooking the value of organic fertilizers, reducing the amount of land for crops, and narrowing the range of soil fertility sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="59" NOVEL> Neglecting to store up organic fertilizers or to make compost, has turned a lot of farmland into "sanitary fields" .</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="6" NOVEL> The idea that your breakfast cereal or toast began life being fertilised with sewage sludge may not be very appealing.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="7" NOVEL> But it seems this will increasingly be the case.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="8" NOVEL> Some 42 per cent of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in the UK each year is already applied to cereal and industrial crops and to grassland.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="9" NOVEL> The quantity is expected to rise sharply in the next 12 years as European Union regulations on effluent treatment double the amount of sludge produced.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="11" NOVEL> UK farmers could save between Pounds 15m and Pounds 22m a year on chemical fertilisers, and obtain similar results, by opting for sludge, says Mark Aitken, environmental scientist at the Scottish Agricultural College.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="12" NOVEL> Aitken will tell local authority and water company representatives at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow today that sludge contains nitrogen and phosphorus - important plant nutrients - and organic matter, which improves the soil's ability to hold water.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="13" NOVEL> But he will emphasise the need for careful analysis since it can also contain heavy metals and organisms that cause salmonella and other diseases.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="14" NOVEL> Fields must be tested, too, for suitability for sludge application.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="15" NOVEL> Sewage sludge is not used to grow fruit and vegetables in case any bacteria splash on to the crop and are not washed off.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="16" NOVEL> But it is safe for cereals because it is applied when plants are young, before the edible ears have grown.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="17" NOVEL> 'The plant is also quite discriminating and doesn't transmit any contaminants to the edible portion,' says Aitken.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="18" NOVEL> The prospect of more sludge being recycled free of charge on fields is likely to worry fertiliser manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="19" NOVEL> Aitken admits it may also be resisted by farmers preferring an inorganic fertiliser which they have used successfully for 20 years to 'some nasty brown stuff'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="6" NOVEL> Unlikely though it may seem, a combination of European Union regulations and green consumerism could result in freeze-dried sewage sludge for sale in supermarkets.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="7" NOVEL> This product idea, based on converting human waste into soil fertiliser, is a result of the response of Wessex Water, one of Britain's privatised water companies, to the EU's 1991 urban waste water directive banning dumping of sewage sludge at sea by the end of 1998.</s>
