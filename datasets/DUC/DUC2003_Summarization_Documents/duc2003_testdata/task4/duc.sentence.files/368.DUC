<s docid="FT941-16729" num="6" NOVEL> The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority yesterday said its members had overcome the initial 'yuk factor' they felt over using eggs from aborted foetuses to treat infertility and were now keeping an open mind.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="7" NOVEL> The HFEA - the government body set up in 1991 to regulate 'test-tube baby' clinics - rushed out a consultation document in response to widespread concern about research which could lead to foetal eggs being used to treat infertile women within three years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="8"> Sir Colin Campbell, HFEA chairman, said yesterday that members of the authority had reacted with 'unease, distaste and surprise' when they first heard about the technique.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="9"> But this emotional response to the 'Yuk factor' had passed, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="10"> The document itself acknowledges that the public 'may feel an initial repugnance' to using aborted foetuses to help women whose own eggs are defective in some way.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="11"> But it says the authority has an open mind and is looking forward to hearing people's views on the issue.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="12" NOVEL> Scientists at Edinburgh University, led by Dr Roger Gosden, have shown that the technique works with animals.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="13" NOVEL> It involves removing ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in the laboratory, fertilising them with sperm and then implanting the resulting embryos into the womb.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="14" NOVEL> Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said it would not be permissible to use human foetal ovaries under present legislation, and Dr Gosden has stopped the research programme until the HFEA has issued new guidelines.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="15" NOVEL> These are not expected before the autumn.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="16" NOVEL> There is currently a severe shortage of donated eggs available for implantation into infertile women, who typically wait between three and five years for treatment in one of Britain's 63 fertility clinics.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="26"> However, it is the first contested case in which the surrogate, impregnated through in vitro fertilization, has no genetic link to the unborn child.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="8"> This may indeed be a natural first reaction to the prospect of removing the ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in a test tube, fertilising them with sperm and implanting them in the uterus of a woman whose own eggs are defective.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="10"> However, initial distaste should not be allowed permanently to block development of a technique that could help many thousands of infertile couples, who typically have to wait three to five years to receive eggs from adult donors.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="26" NOVEL> The HFEA's record suggests that, if it decides in principle that foetal ovaries can be used to treat infertility, it will be able to devise a practical framework in which clinics can operate.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="27" NOVEL> The real obstacles would then be scientific.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="28" NOVEL> Although the technique has worked in laboratory animals, researchers still need to show that there is no excess risk of congenital abnormality from using eggs from a foetus instead of an adult donor.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="29" NOVEL> That means understanding better the factors that control the decline in egg numbers from more than 1m in the foetus to less than 100,000 in a fertile woman; if the body naturally discards inferior eggs during childhood, it could be dangerous to use foetal ovaries.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="30"> Subject to these legal and scientific safeguards, researchers should be allowed to develop foetal egg donation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="31" NOVEL> If they succeed, the technique will eventually join the armoury of accepted treatments that aroused distaste when they were first mooted, including organ transplants and test-tube babies.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0025" num="31" NOVEL> At about $1,950 to $2,800 a treatment, Singapore's IVF costs are among the lowest in the world -- in some cases, less than half the cost in the United States, Ratnam said.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0025" num="34" NOVEL> He said foreign interest increased after National delivered the world's first baby conceived by micro-injection of sperm into an egg last year.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0025" num="35" NOVEL> Techniques such as using an artificial womb constructed with inner-lining Fallopian cells help boost the chances for a successful pregnancy by allowing the embryo to develop before implanting it into the womb.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0025" num="36" NOVEL> Most embryos are implanted within 36 hours of fertilization, but with the artificial womb, the embryo can be kept alive for more than five days.</s>

<s docid="LA120789-0015" num="12" NOVEL> Werlin initially transferred unfrozen eggs, which had been fertilized with sperm from the older woman's husband, directly to the mother's womb.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="10" NOVEL> The egg, produced by the woman and fertilized with sperm from her husband by an infertility clinic in Norfolk, Va., had been the subject of a four-month, cross-country legal wrangle.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="11" NOVEL> Emerging from American Airlines Flight 75 from Washington, Risa Adler York and her husband, Dr. Stephen York, looked pleasantly surprised at the size of the crowd of reporters and camera crews that were there trying to catch glimpses of the unusual container and pressing the couple for details of their efforts to win "custody" over the fertilized egg from the Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="16"> In 1985, the Yorks, then residents of New Jersey, had gone to the Norfolk clinic, one of the oldest and most famous reproductive centers on the East Coast, to get help in conceiving a child through an in vitro fertilization program.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="19" NOVEL> The Yorks, however, tired of their semiannual cross-country trips and decided to have the final embryo implanted by a physician in Los Angeles at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, which the couple believe has a better success rate at impregnating women with frozen in vitro fertilized eggs than does the Virginia clinic.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="20" NOVEL> For months, the Virginia clinic, however, denied the Yorks' request to transfer the frozen embryo.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="21" NOVEL> The Yorks' lawyers argued that the couple had a right to what they considered was their "potential child".</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="11" NOVEL> Because Mrs. Davis could not conceive normally, the couple opted for in vitro fertilization -- so-called test-tube fertilization -- where egg and sperm are united in a laboratory and surgically implanted in the woman's uterus.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="12" NOVEL> Part of the way through this process, after fertilization and before implantation of seven of the fertilized eggs, the marriage fell apart and the couple decided to divorce.</s>
