<s docid="FT933-16910" num="7" NOVEL> NINE MEMBERS of the European Community agreed yesterday to abolish formal passport controls at all internal frontiers by December 1.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="8" NOVEL> From that date, travellers between Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the Benelux countries will be able to pass freely across internal borders, including ports and airports.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="9" NOVEL> Travellers from Britain, Ireland and Denmark will still be subject to the same immigration checks as other international travellers arriving in the free-travel zone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="10" NOVEL> The deal, if it can be put into effect, will put pressure on Britain - which strongly opposes removing all passport checks - Ireland and Denmark to speed up their efforts to reduce controls.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="15" NOVEL> Yesterday's political declaration is subject, however, to conditions, insisted on by the new centre-right French government, which is still worried about the risks involved in allowing free movement of people.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="16" NOVEL> In addition, certain large EC airports - including those serving Amsterdam and Brussels - will be given time to adapt their infrastructure to the new system, which will require splitting immigration and baggage-handling facilities for passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="17"> The delay means that some controls may be retained beyond December 1, even for travellers within the Schengen zone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="18" NOVEL> A special Schengen committee will have to decide in October whether there has been sufficient progress in three key areas to justify opening all internal borders: improved checks on people coming from outside the free travel zone; action against drug trafficking; and the establishment of a Schengen information system, linking police and immigration authorities in the nine member states.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16523" num="6"> MINISTERS from nine EC member states yesterday underlined their commitment to lifting passport checks on travellers within the European Community.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16523" num="14" NOVEL> Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's new minister for European affairs, said external borders would have to be strengthened and national rules on drugs harmonised before internal checks could be abolished.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14347" num="10"> The nine ministers must decide today whether the Schengen group has made sufficient progress in three key areas: improving checks on people coming from outside the free-travel zone; fighting drug trafficking; and linking police and immigration authorities by computer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14347" num="16"> Agreement would allow Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC internal market commissioner, to press ahead with attempts to persuade Britain, Ireland and Denmark to abolish controls on travellers coming from other EC countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="15" NOVEL> With the so-called Schengen Information System the search for criminals and rejected asylum-seekers be made easier.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="16" NOVEL> As soon as the information system, which is currently being tested, is put into operation, the Schengen Accord will come into force.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="17" NOVEL> In it the Schengen states have committed themselves to the gradual reduction of identity checks at the inland borders with compensation measures for checks at the external borders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="18"> According to the Schengen agreement, control of the external borders will be harmonized, as will the regulations for the issuing of visas and the entry of foreigners from third states.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="19" NOVEL> At first the data of about 1 million people will be stored in the search system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="20" NOVEL> At the beginning of the next year, material data relating to the search for e.g. forged passports, weapons, and stolen cars is to be added.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="21" NOVEL> In Germany alone access to the system, whose headquarters is in Strasbourg, will be possible via about 8,000 terminals at border checkpoints, in police stations, and during mobile operations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44277" num="23" NOVEL> For the time being, Germany, France, Benelux states, Spain, and Portugal will participate in this system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="29" NOVEL> The MEP moreover encouraged Italy, Greece and Portugal to overcome the delays in the practical implementation of the Schengen Accord and those countries not able to accede to the Accord at least adopt security measures comparable to those planned for the Schengen countries, and insisted on the need for border controls to be lifted before the summer vacations.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="9"> Senior officials from the Schengen group of countries - all 12 EU members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - agreed yesterday their governments would not be able to meet the most recent target date of February 1 for ending passport controls.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="10" NOVEL> They refused to set another deadline, as they could not predict when the Schengen zone's computer system - which is supposed to link up immigration and police authorities - would be running efficiently enough to replace border surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="8" NOVEL> The lifting of frontier controls on goods and people was perhaps the most symbolic goal of the single market programme.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="10" NOVEL> Member states appear to have met the deadline for lifting frontier controls on goods.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="18" NOVEL> If member states keep their nerve - and do not allow the inevitable media scares about loopholes and errors to shake them into a hasty reimposition of controls - then free movement of goods seems more or less assured.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="19" NOVEL> The abolition of passport controls presents quite different problems, which are unlikely to be resolved before the end of this year, if at all.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="21"> Britain has always been the member state most vehemently opposed to the lifting of border controls on people and its government's argument is relatively simple.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="22" NOVEL> The 1986 Single European Act, it says, does not oblige the UK to lift its controls on non-EC citizens.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="23" NOVEL> Consequently, Britain must maintain at least a minimal check to ensure that unwanted non-EC travellers do not slip through the EC passport lane at ports and airports.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="25" NOVEL> Denmark wants to maintain border controls, but has indicated in the past it might be prepared to lift them if sufficient safeguards are put in place.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="26" NOVEL> Ireland claims to be committed to the lifting of controls.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="34" NOVEL> Increasing immigration pressures and racial tension, particularly in Germany, have made the Schengen nine think twice about lifting their internal border controls as quickly as they had intended.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="35" NOVEL> The Schengen accord does commit them to abolish internal checks, but only when external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened, and ancillary measures - such as a computer link between Schengen immigration authorities -have been put in place.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="38" NOVEL> Airports - most notably the busy Schiphol hub in Amsterdam - have won a deferral of the deadline for lifting controls, on the grounds that they cannot physically change their infrastructure before December this year to separate EC and non-EC arrivals.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="45" NOVEL> If Britain - or, indeed, Ireland and Denmark - decides to apply only minimal checks to travellers arriving from outside the Community then Schengen members may have to start examining the passports of passengers on flights and ferries from non-Schengen EC partners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="18" NOVEL> 3. For the purpose of abolishing personal controls at internal borders, the Executive Committee agreed on measures to be taken, especially the removal of traffic obstacles and lifting of traffic restrictions at border crossing points; a plan of such measures was adopted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="28" NOVEL> 8. The participating countries place themselves under an obligation to adapt their national information systems to the central information system in Strasbourg, so that a trouble-free transfer of data can occur.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="35" NOVEL> The already adopted regulation concerning unified visa issuance procedures has been supplemented by an additional regulation concerning the issuance of visas at borders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="36" NOVEL> 12. In addition, a protocol was signed whereby the provisions of the Schengen Agreement concerning the granting of political asylum will be replaced by the relevant provisions of the Dublin Agreement once the latter agreement has entered into effect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="24" NOVEL> The Schengen accord is soon to be extended to include Portugal and -- in subsequent stages -- Greece and Spain, and finally the British Isles and Denmark.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="10"> The Schengen system is simple in essence.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="11" NOVEL> A central computer in Strasbourg holds police and immigration records.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="12" NOVEL> Officials in the nine member countries of the Schengen accord - the UK, Denmark and Ireland have excluded themselves - have access to the information over telecommunications links.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="17" NOVEL> Each of the nine countries has responsibility for developing its own system, linking police and immigration authorities, and ensuring it is ready for connection to Strasbourg.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="15" NOVEL> It was at Schengen - or, more accurately, in a boat moored beneath the bridge - that France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the Schengen agreement in June 1990 which was supposed to herald the barrier-free Community.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="16"> The five countries, now swollen to nine, committed themselves to moving ahead of the rest of the EC by lifting controls on people by January 1 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="17"> Only Britain, Denmark and Ireland have not signed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="11" NOVEL> One of the Schengen arrangements provides that, as a general rule, asylum-seekers can only apply for refuge in one state.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="12" NOVEL> France's top court ruled in August that this infringed asylum rights enshrined in the constitution.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="13" NOVEL> However, the president and prime minister agreed on a compromise which has yet to be put in place.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="14"> France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the agreement in 1990, and Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have subsequently signed.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="9"> For Britain, which has always opposed lifting controls on people, the unwillingness or inability of more enthusiastic countries to abolish passport checks is a relief.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="13"> The nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all the EC countries except the UK, Denmark and Ireland - are unlikely to abolish their controls before the middle of next year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="14"> They are worried because agreements to strengthen external EC frontiers are not yet in place, and their own information system - linking immigration authorities - is not ready.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="15"> EC airports, which have to rebuild terminals to separate international and EC flight arrivals, have been given until December 1993 to get ready for the new regime.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="16"> Denmark and Ireland, for different reasons, will retain checks at borders at least until the continental EC countries have completed their free-travel zone, if not longer.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="21" NOVEL> A two- or three-speed Europe, in which passport controls are lifted only gradually, seems inevitable.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="26"> Schengen countries are still determined to abolish passport checks.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="27"> But the most Britain will do is move to a minimal system of controls on EC travellers at sea-ports, which would still be unacceptable to the Schengen countries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="29" NOVEL> Plans for EC-wide co-ordination of the fight against drug trafficking were blocked yesterday by a dispute between interior ministers about where a European drugs unit should be located.</s>

<s docid="LA070190-0033" num="31"> France/Germany/the Netherlands/Belgium/Luxembourg: By early 1992, these countries hope to abolish border checks, months in advance of the 12-nation European Community's deadline of Jan. 1, 1993, to remove internal border controls.</s>

<s docid="LA070190-0033" num="32"> Known as the Schengen Accord for the Luxembourg town in which it was signed June 19, the agreement (when it is ratified by the five countries) should speed cross-border traffic and give the EEC some experience in border integration.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9293" num="11" NOVEL> The rift occurred in a debate on the Schengen Accord, a treaty between Germany and other continental European Community states which will relax internal border controls and tighten restrictions at external frontiers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-6931" num="8" NOVEL> Mr Bangemann said yesterday the nine continental European members of the Schengen free travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow EC visitors to Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control after January 1 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT924-6931" num="11"> 'What I'm interested in is having a practical situation at the borders which shows (member states) are taking on board what we believe is essential, and that is: no regular controls at internal borders'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-6931" num="18"> Denmark and Ireland also have specific problems, and even the nine Schengen countries are worried that controls on external EC frontiers may not be strong enough to justify lifting border checks so soon.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5835" num="11"> Britain itself is still adamant that controls on people are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5835" num="12" NOVEL> That stance has put the UK in dispute with the European Commission and the nine continental European members of the Schengen free-travel zone.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5835" num="16" NOVEL> They believe that compromise would undermine the barrier-free internal market - and weakens the EC's external frontiers, where checks are supposed to be more rigorous .</s>

<s docid="FT934-6237" num="7" NOVEL> The European Commission yesterday approved a proposed list of 129 countries whose citizens will require visas to enter the European Union.</s>

<s docid="FT934-6237" num="8" NOVEL> But plans to draw up a 'positive' list of non-EU nationals who would not require a visa had to be dropped following opposition within the Commission.</s>

<s docid="FT934-6237" num="14" NOVEL> If approved unanimously, the proposals will also mean that EU countries will have to recognise each others' visas.</s>

<s docid="FT934-6237" num="15"> The Schengen countries have already agreed to abolish all controls at internal frontiers from February 1, 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT934-6237" num="16"> But Britain, Ireland and Denmark are likely to maintain certain systematic passport checks at their borders beyond that date.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="7" NOVEL> THE European commission will take legal action against EC members which fail to remove passport controls at internal EC borders by the end of this year, the internal market commissioner warned yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="15"> The Schengen convention still has to be ratified by Germany and Greece, but Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he hoped Germany at least would ratify by early July.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="18"> The UK disputes the Commission's interpretation that controls must be lifted on all travellers within the Community, and says the rules apply only to EC travellers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="19"> Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, who favours a non-confrontational approach, said he had been encouraged by the gradual introduction of what he called the 'blue wave' - a system by which EC citizens simply show the cover of their passports at internal borders.</s>

<s docid="FT944-4056" num="7"> The Schengen accord to end border controls between nine European Union states will finally come into effect on March 26 next year, Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, one of France's new EU commissioners, told Le Figaro newspaper in an interview.</s>

<s docid="FT944-4056" num="13"> Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have signed the accord.</s>

<s docid="FT944-4056" num="14" NOVEL> Austria, which joins the EU next month, has observer status.</s>

<s docid="FT944-4056" num="15" NOVEL> Britain, Ireland and Denmark have kept their distance as have the two other new members, Finland and Sweden.</s>
