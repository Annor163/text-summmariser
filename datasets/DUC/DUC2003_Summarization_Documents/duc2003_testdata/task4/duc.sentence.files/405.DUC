<s docid="FT922-11472" num="8" NOVEL> These are by far the earliest signs of the 'lumpiness' of the universe, which gravity was later to pull together into galaxies, stars, planets and the objects familiar from life on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="10" NOVEL> Even so, it is the most important event in cosmology since 1964, when scientists detected microwave radiation coming uniformly from all parts of the sky - a faint after-glow left over from the Big Bang itself.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="15" NOVEL> This week's discovery - the result of 300m observations made over the course of a year by Nasa's Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (Cobe) - will help cosmologists to resolve these mysteries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="16"> Cobe has found variations in the cosmic background radiation which had previously seemed to come so evenly from all directions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="17" NOVEL> Analysis by computer proves that these are genuine fluctuations in the after-glow from the Big Bang, rather than distortions caused by radiation from astronomical objects.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="18" NOVEL> The variations represent huge ripples of matter, stretching across billions of light-years of space and dating back about 15bn years to when the universe was just 300,000 years old.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="21" NOVEL> Cobe has in effect taken a huge leap back in time to a universe 0.002 per cent of its present age.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="27" NOVEL> At the same time, minute fluctuations in the density of matter arose, leading to the cosmic ripples seen by Cobe and eventually the uneven universe in which we live.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="10"> The Cosmic Background Explorer (Cobe) spacecraft, launched in 1989, has detected variations within the after-glow.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="11" NOVEL> These arose from fluctuations in the universe one-trillionth (million-millionth) of a second after its creation.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="8"> The 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 also made a powerful impact on the public imagination - partly because professional astronomers had prepared the ground well, for example laying on press conferences to brief the media about what some predicted would be the greatest cosmic spectacle since the invention of the telescope.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="19" NOVEL> On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than 10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from elsewhere in the galaxy.</s>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="9" NOVEL> An asteroid half a mile wide, blazing through space at nearly 50,000 m.p.h., skirted past Earth last month in a cosmic "close call" unrivaled in the last 50 years, NASA officials said Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="10" NOVEL> The asteroid, identified as 1989FC, passed within 500,000 miles of Earth -- about twice the distance to the moon -- on March 23, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="10" NOVEL> Giant "blobs" of material have been discovered around a mysterious object near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, leading scientists to believe they may be getting their best look yet at one of the most baffling objects in the universe -- a black hole.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="17" NOVEL> Wednesday, scientists told the American Astronomical Society meeting here that they believe that they have identified a series of giant "blobs" -- most likely clouds of hot, charged gas particles -- around an object known as Sagittarius A, which had been discovered previously by an infrared telescope.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="19" NOVEL> Each of the giant blobs measures nearly a trillion miles in diameter.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="32" NOVEL> "'Radiographs," which are similar to photographs, produced by the scientists show that the cloud of dust is being swept past the star much the same as the tail of a comet is pushed back by the solar wind.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="33" NOVEL> The cloud is pointing directly away from Sagittarius A, just as the tail of a comet points away from the sun.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="18" NOVEL> The Hubble observations are the first phase of an international programme to assess the scale, size and age of the universe with the space telescope.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="19" NOVEL> The research team found 20 individual stars of a type called Cepheid variables in the distant M100 galaxy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="34" NOVEL> Some of the best shots, released this month by the US space agency Nasa, show parts of the universe billions of light years away - and therefore billions of years in the past.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="35" NOVEL> They reveal for the first time the shape of galaxies emerging in the young universe.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="36" NOVEL> 'There is a menagerie of strange objects that have no counterpart in today's universe,' said Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="37" NOVEL> Most of the stars are arranged in disorganised groups that look like torn fragments of present-day spiral galaxies but may in fact be their precursors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="38" NOVEL> Confusingly, mature elliptical galaxies also seem to have existed within 2bn years of the Big Bang, very similar to today's.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="41" NOVEL> Yet another fragment of Hubble evidence in favour of a an ever expanding universe came in November, when astronomers published the results of a search for small dim stars, too faint to be seen from Earth, which they thought might make up some of the universe's 'missing mass'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="42" NOVEL> They found far fewer than expected.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="18" NOVEL> Two years ago, an exploding star, called a supernova, was discovered in the southern sky, and it was the brightest supernova seen in 400 years, according to historical records.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="21" NOVEL> Just as the theories suggested, the supernova has demonstrated that exploding stars produce the heavy elements that make up so much of the universe.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="22" NOVEL> More recently, scientists have discovered what they had expected to find at the center of the supernova, a spinning neutron star called a pulsar that sends off energy like a spinning lighthouse.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="23" NOVEL> But no one expected the pulsar to be spinning as rapidly as it apparently is: 2,000 times a second.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="24" NOVEL> That rapid spin rate is one of the bigger surprises in Supernova 1987A, which is in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 170,000 light years away.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="25" NOVEL> Equally important, however, was the discovery that the supernova was sending out neutrinos.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="26" NOVEL> In all, 20 neutrinos were detected in two large detectors, one in Japan and the other in Ohio.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="36" NOVEL> For Supernova 1987A, scientists tried to determine the speed of the neutrinos on the basis of the time of the sighting of the explosion.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="37" NOVEL> Since they arrived at Earth at virtually the same time as the visible light, the 20 detected neutrinos did not have enough mass to be significant.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="38" NOVEL> But all 20 of those were of one type, called electron neutrinos.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="39" NOVEL> There are two other types, called the muon and tau neutrinos, which are stronger candidates for having significant mass, and which were not detected from Supernova 1987A.</s>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="8" NOVEL> Astronomers have discovered what may be the largest galaxy in the known universe, a mammoth cluster of stars that stretches for 6 million light years -- more than 60 times the size of the Milky Way, it was reported today.</s>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="9" NOVEL> The giant object is located in the heart of a cluster of galaxies known as Abell 2029, a team of astronomers reported in the journal Science.</s>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="12" NOVEL> A mosaic of 16 images made with light-sensitive electronic "chips" showed the diffuse halo to be remarkably uniform, leading the astronomers to conclude they were looking at a single galaxy, the largest ever discovered.</s>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="13" NOVEL> Measurements indicate that the galaxy has a diameter of 6 million light years, more than 4 1/2 times the diameter of the previous record holder and 60 times wider than Earth's Milky Way, which has a diameter of about 100,000 light years.</s>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="17" NOVEL> The galaxy shines with 2 trillion times the light produced by Earth's sun and is elliptical in shape.</s>

<s docid="LA121190-0160" num="23" NOVEL> Two of the telescopes also provided unprecedented evidence that indicates the existence of black holes.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0061" num="9" NOVEL> Australian astronomers said Friday they have discovered an asteroid several hundred yards long that crossed the Earth's orbital path in June.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0061" num="10" NOVEL> The asteroid, temporarily named 1990MU, came within 1.2 million miles of the Earth's surface and intersected the planet's path around the sun.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="9" NOVEL> Astronomers have discovered a tiny, rapidly rotating neutron star that appears to be murdering a companion sun in a case of celestial fratricide that promises to shed light on stellar evolution and death.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="10" NOVEL> The "eclipsing millisecond pulsar," the massive remnant of an exploded sun, and its companion white dwarf star are located in Terzan 5, a globular star cluster near the center of the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of about 24,000 light years.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="11" NOVEL> The newly discovered pulsar, known as PSR 1744-24, and its white dwarf companion whirl about each other every 109 minutes at a distance of just 18,600 miles -- 1/13th the distance from the Earth to the moon -- according to a report in the British journal Nature.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="12" NOVEL> The pulsar, about six miles wide, has 1 1/2 times the mass of our sun.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="13" NOVEL> The white dwarf, a small star in the final stages of its life, is about the size of the Earth.</s>

<s docid="LA102290-0067" num="14" NOVEL> The two stars are so close to each other that the pulsar's intense radiation is blowing away the atmosphere of the white dwarf so that it will eventually dwindle to nothing, researchers said.</s>

<s docid="LA111789-0151" num="10" NOVEL> Scientists have discovered the largest structure seen so far in the universe, a narrow sheet of galaxies stretching more than half a billion light years across space.</s>

<s docid="LA111789-0151" num="12" NOVEL> Margaret Geller and John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge said the string of galaxies is 500 million light-years long, 200 million light-years wide, and about 15 million light-years thick.</s>

<s docid="LA111789-0151" num="15" NOVEL> The Great Wall is more than 200 million light-years away from Earth, and it cannot be seen with the unaided eye.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-46660" num="19" NOVEL> The Granat, providing world scientists with the most different discoveries, recently discovered two objects which are of burning interest for modern astronomy: these are so-called binary X-ray sources.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="40"> Two of the telescopes found strong evidence that mysterious objects known as black holes do exist, although no one will ever be able to see them.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="46" NOVEL> Astro's Broad Band X-Ray Telescope was trained on one galaxy, called Markarian 335, that is thought to be harboring a black hole.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="47" NOVEL> The result, said astronomer Peter Serlemitsos, the instrument's principal investigator, "tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black holes," because the sensitive instrument found exactly what theorists had predicted it would find if the galaxy has a black hole at its center.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="51" NOVEL> The X-ray telescope also measures the level at which X-rays are being produced by the target, and, according to theory, that level should rise enormously near a black hole because more material is being ripped apart in the violent process.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="52" NOVEL> And, in a dramatic announcement Friday, Serlemitsos said the data collected by his instrument amounted to "undisputed evidence that this upturn does indeed take place".</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="53" NOVEL> Farther out from the region where the X-rays are being produced, the swirling gas and dust around a black hole should emit ultraviolet light.</s>
