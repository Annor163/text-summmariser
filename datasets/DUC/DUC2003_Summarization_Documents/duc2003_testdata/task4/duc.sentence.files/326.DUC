<s docid="FT943-536" num="13" NOVEL> The ship's officers failed to notice because of a culture of 'sloppiness' throughout the P & O subsidiary that operated the ship.</s>
<s docid="FT943-536" num="23" NOVEL> This means that neither space nor time is wasted, but comparatively small quantities of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop a heavy list, and capsize.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="8" NOVEL> The answer will depend on the conclusions of the various inquiries into the Estonia sinking, now thought to have cost more than 900 lives.</s>
