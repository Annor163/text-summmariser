<s docid="FT933-3956" num="7" NOVEL> THE US Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday it had given Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals concern, final clearance to market Cognex, the first drug specifically approved in the US for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FT933-3956" num="11" NOVEL> Even so, Warner-Lambert shares rose sharply yesterday afternoon, closing Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 69 1/8. The drug was found to be effective in easing the symptoms of patients in the mild-to-moderate stages of Alzheimer's, an illness characterised by progressive decline of memory, judgment and ability to reason.</s>
<s docid="FT933-3956" num="12" NOVEL> There is no evidence that Cognex alters the course of the underlying dementia process.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="44" NOVEL> The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="45" NOVEL> The first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="46" NOVEL> Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this neurotransmitter.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="47" NOVEL> Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="48" NOVEL> They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from Forest Laboratories of the US.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="49" NOVEL> Although they have shown promise in clinical trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="53" NOVEL> However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FT922-715" num="54" NOVEL> None prevents the build-up of tangled plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains.</s>
<s docid="LA020590-0126" num="16" NOVEL> The scientific grapevine indicates that 30% to 40% of Alzheimer's patients may experience some benefit from THA, with a very small subgroup doing extremely well.</s>
<s docid="LA020590-0126" num="17" NOVEL> This drug is not a cure, and the best that can be expected is a temporary improvement.</s>
<s docid="FT924-8306" num="9" NOVEL> It found that Warner-Lambert's tacrine, known as Cognex, had statistically significant results over a placebo in 'primary outcome measures' used to evaluate the effects of a drug on Alzheimer's.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1565" num="6" NOVEL> SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer group, has signed a co-promotion deal with Sigma-Tau, the Italian private healthcare company, to sell a drug in the US for degenerative disorders - including Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1565" num="11" NOVEL> Previous trials in Italy showed the drug could retard dementia in Alzheimer's disease, improving attention span, long-term memory and verbal ability.</s>
<s docid="FT922-1565" num="12" NOVEL> Meanwhile, SmithKline is developing two drugs, oxiracetam and denbufylline,for the treatment of Alzheimer's.</s>
<s docid="FT931-2434" num="7"> WARNER Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals company, has finally received a recommendation for marketing approval for its Cognex drug to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="13" NOVEL> Discovery's deprenyl citrate is intended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="27" NOVEL> Discovery claims that there are: ``four distinct functions of deprenyl in helping curb or delay the effects of Alzheimer's disease, and could very well delay the onset of disease, if taken as a preventative.</s>
<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="83" NOVEL> iii. Discussion . Taken at face value, the results in this published study suggest a positive effect of L-deprenyl in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</s>
<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="84" NOVEL> However, the published report lacks many of the details needed to assess a study.</s>
<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="112" NOVEL> This seven-patient study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; its primary purpose was to investigate tranylcypromine, a drug of unknown effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (see, e.g., 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)(iv)). 8.</s>
<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="14" NOVEL> Physostigmine has produced demonstrable but small clinical improvements in patient's with Alzheimer's disease, but these are severely limited by (i) its short half-life (approximately 30 minutes) and (ii) its high incidence of toxic side-effects at doses that produce only modest enzyme inhibition.</s>
<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="15" NOVEL> It is widely accepted that the narrow therapeutic index of physostigmine and some other first generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors limits the administration of these at adequate doses to affect cognition.</s>
<s docid="FT934-3850" num="38" NOVEL> Zofran, also known as ondansetron, was as effective as Warner-Lambert's Cognex for the treatment of Alzheimer's symptoms and was far safer, said Dr Sykes.</s>
