The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq held their first direct talks since a 
cease-fire was declared in the Persian Gulf War nearly two years ago.

Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz described his hourlong meeting with Iranian 
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati as "cordial and constructive." The two sides 
agreed to the meeting at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva after discussions with 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The U.N. chief described the 
agreement as a breakthrough and a clear sign that both governments want a 
resolution of their bitter conflict.
