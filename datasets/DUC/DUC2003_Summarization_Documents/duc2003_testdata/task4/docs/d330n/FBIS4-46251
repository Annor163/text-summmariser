<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Items on Velayati's Agenda </F>
During His Visit to Baghdad"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Tehran 
announced yesterday that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati has accepted an invitation to visit Iraq early next 
month. 
  Velayati, who will be the first Iranian minister to visit 
Iraq since 1978, is expected to discuss "an important and deep 
change in bilateral relations," according to sources in Tehran. 
  The agenda will include four issues: 
  To achieve a phased settlement to the dispute over the Shatt 
al-'Arab waterway on the basis of the 1975 Algiers agreement. 
To coordinate to prevent the establishment of a 
semi-independent Kurdish state in north Iraq. Iran reached a 
separate agreement with Turkey on this issue, while Syria 
announced its commitment to Iraq's territorial integrity. To 
agree on a joint policy against Washington, and the two sides 
will work to set up a broader grouping that could include 
Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya; it could also include Qatar. 
To embark on a joint economic action to ease the effects of the 
UN sanctions imposed on Iraq, without violating the Security 
Council resolutions. Iran is already allowing the delivery to 
Iraq of huge quantities of food supplies, medicine, and 
"durable" commodities through operations across the border. 
  But there are several sources of tension in relations 
between 
Tehran and Baghdad; most importantly, either side is financing 
and supporting the exiled groups opposed to the other. The 
arrest recently of two people in Tehran on the pretext that they 
are Iraqi intelligence officers is an indication that the two 
sides are continuing the hostile operations which were 
originally designed during the eight-year war between the two 
countries. 
  Iraq is sheltering and financing several Iranian opposition 
groups, including the Mojahedin-e Khalq, the Kurdish Democratic 
Party [of Iran], and several Baluch groups. While Iran is 
supporting Shiite Iraqi organizations fighting the Baghdad 
regime.
