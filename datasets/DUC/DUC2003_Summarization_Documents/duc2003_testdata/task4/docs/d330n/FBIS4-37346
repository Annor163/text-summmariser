  [Text] Tehran, June 18 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Ali Akbar 
Velayati said Saturday that an Iranian delegation would visit 
Iraq in two weeks to prepare for his forthcoming visit, the 
first by a senior Iranian official since 1991. 
  The delegation had been due in Baghdad on June 11, but the 
trip was postponed at the last minute for unspecified reasons. 
  Velayati told AFP that the delay had been mutually agreed by 
upon the two countries. 
  But a senior Iranian official told AFP the visit had been 
postponed "at the request of Iraqi authorities." 
  The minister said he still expected to visit Baghdad in 
July, 
in the first visit to Iraq by a top Iranian official since the 
1991 Gulf war. 
  The visit is aimed at continuing discussions to normalise 
ties five years after the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
Talks resumed last October after they were broken in the wake 
of the Gulf war. 
  Tehran and Baghdad are sharply divided over a number of 
issues, mainly the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from 
both countries.
