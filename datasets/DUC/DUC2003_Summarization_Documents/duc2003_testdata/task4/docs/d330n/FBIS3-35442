  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 24, IRNA -- The Persian daily `ABRAR' 
Thursday predicted that foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will 
meet in the near [word indistinct]. Referring to the visit by 
an Iraqi Foreign Ministry delegation to Iran, ended yesterday, 
the morning daily said in its editorial that the two sides 
assessed the outcome of Tehran negotiations as partly positive. 
  Some informed sources believe that a better atmosphere 
prevailed over the negotiations as compared to the previous 
talks held in Baghdad, the daily said adding that it seems that 
new horizons have been opened up to the bilateral ties. 
However, it added, Iraqis continue to insist on some of their 
positions. "A country which has plunged the region for almost 
ten years into war and adopted an absolutely deterrent diplomacy 
towards peace and tranquility, should not imagine that can 
regain the lost confidence overnight even if it would have 
abandoned its past policies. 
  "Since the trend of the talks is evaluated as being 
positive, 
foreign ministers of the two countries would meet in the near 
future to promote the level of negotiating delegations and 
accelerate the process of folllowing up bilateral issues," ABRAR 
concluded.
