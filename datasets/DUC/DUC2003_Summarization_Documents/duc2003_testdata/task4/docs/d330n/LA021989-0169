Military officers from Iran and Iraq will meet Wednesday at their common border 
to help stabilize a cease-fire, U.N. peacekeepers announced. U.N. officials 
said each country will be represented by 10 officers who will work with their 
governments and the U.N. observers to resolve problems in carrying out the Aug. 
20 cease-fire agreement that halted the eight-year Iran-Iraq War. But in 
Baghdad, Tarik Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, said he sees no hope of positive 
results from fresh peace talks "if the Iranian side continues evading basic 
issues and insists only on propaganda."
