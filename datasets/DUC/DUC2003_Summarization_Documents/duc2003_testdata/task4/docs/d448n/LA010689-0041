A Saudi Arabian tanker caught in a storm in the southern Persian Gulf was left 
ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz with eight of its crewmen missing, shipping 
executives reported. They identified the vessel as the 36,904-ton Sagheera, 
manned by a 34-member crew of Greek officers and Sri Lankan sailors. The Omani 
navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats but eight remained unaccounted for, 
the shipping officials said. It was not immediately known what started the fire 
aboard the Sagheera or where the ship was headed. The storm was said to have 
caused waves as high as 30 feet in the southern gulf and in the strait.
