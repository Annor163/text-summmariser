A Maltese cargo ship carrying a load of cement apparently sank off western 
France and 12 sailors are missing, the coast guard reported Thursday.

It said the Scan Trader sent a distress signal Sunday night as 96-m.p.h. winds 
whipped through the Bay of Biscay. Searchers found no sign of the vessel, but 
lifejackets from the ship washed up on the beaches at Arcachon on Thursday, 
appearing to confirm fears that the vessel had gone down, the coast guard said.

<P>
The ship left Bilbao, Spain, on Saturday.
