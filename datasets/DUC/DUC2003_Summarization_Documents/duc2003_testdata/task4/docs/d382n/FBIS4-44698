  [Text] Ulm--On 13 April the German automaker Daimler-Benz 
experimented with a hydrogen-fueled car at its Ulm research 
center. According to the group's CEO, Edzard Reuter, the vehicle 
marks "a first step toward `ecological mobility,'" 
  The vehicle's electric engine is not fueled by batteries, 
but 
by its own small electrical plant that runs on hydrogen. The 
hydrogen converts solely into water vapor, which is expelled 
into the air. Reuter considers the advance significant not only 
for the automobile industry, but for energy supply in general. 
Daimler could play an important role in the market for new 
energies in the future through its knowledge of the new 
technique. 
  But Hartmut Weule of Daimler's research department stressed 
that it will take engineers and researchers years of continued 
testing before the revolutionary model can be mass-manufactured. 
Daimler group has already invested over 100 million German marks 
in hydrogen vehicle research.
