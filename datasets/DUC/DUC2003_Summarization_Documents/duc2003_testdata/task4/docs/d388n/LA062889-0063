A Santa Cruz businessman wants to build a center in Alameda that uses 
California red worms to recycle organic waste. The worms eat their own weight 
in waste each day and "show a strong preference for paper mill and sewage 
sludge," David Eagle of Earthworm Technology said in a letter to the Alameda 
City Council. According to Eagle, one ton of worms can multiply into 1,000 tons 
in a single year.
