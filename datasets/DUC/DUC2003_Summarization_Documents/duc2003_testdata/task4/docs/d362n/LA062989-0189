Federal immigration agents raided a suspected "drop house" early today in Bell 
where 47 illegal immigrants were being held until their relatives could buy 
their freedom, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Five smugglers were detained after the 12:30 a.m. raid on an apartment that had 
no furniture, no food in the refrigerator and only some beans on the stove, 
said Thomas Gaines of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
The smugglers found in the Bell home are suspected illegal aliens from Mexico, 
said Gaines, the assistant district director in the INS' anti-smuggling branch. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants were Honduran and Mexican citizens, including a 17-year-old boy 
from Mexico and two women from Honduras, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
When the agents arrived, the telephone was "ringing off the hook" with 
relatives calling to pay the smugglers to free the immigrants at prices ranging 
from $300 to $700, Gaines said.
