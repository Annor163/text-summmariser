  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--Criminals responsible for 
organising illegal emigration from China face severe punishment, 
including the death penalty, under a tough new law passed last 
week, the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] said Sunday [6 March]. 
The law, passed at a National People's Congress standing 
committee session Saturday [5 March], warns that "snake heads," 
or criminals who are behind illegal immigration rackets, will 
face jail terms of between seven years and life for their 
involvement in illegal emigration schemes, the report said. 
Those guilty of the murder, injury, rape or sale of illegal 
emigrants or of the murder or injury of border inspectors may be 
sentenced to death, the new law states. 
  Previously, the maximum penalty for organising illegal 
emigration was five years imprisonment, but a surge last year in 
the numbers of Chinese paying snake heads up to 30,000 dollars 
to be smuggled abroad on decrepit ships has forced the 
authorities to stiffen punishment. In the most spectacular 
case, six illegal immigrants died when almost 300 of them tried 
to swim and wade ashore after their ship, the Golden Venture, 
ran aground in New York City in June.
