 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide licenses to
practice the inventions embodied in U.S. Patent 5,171,750, entitled ``Substituted Phenserines as Specific Inhibitors
of Acetylcholinesterase'' and U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/861,329 and 08/096,207, both entitled ``Phenylcarbamates
of (-)-Eseroline, (-)-N1-Noreseroline and (-)-N1-Benzylnoreseroline: Selective Inhibitors of Acetyl and/or
Butyrylcholinesterase,'' 07/765,766, entitled ``Thiapysovenine and Carbamate Analogs, Pharmaceutical Compositions
and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' 07/845,081 and 08/182,301, both entitled ``Carbamate Analogs of
Thiaphysovenine, Pharmaceutical Compositions, and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' and 07/980,399,
entitled ``Method for Treating Cognitive Disorders With Phenserine'' to CURE, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland. The
patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America.

The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published
notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The patent and patent applications disclose several novel, potent and long-acting anti-cholinesterase agents
that enhance cognition and are highly promising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other
neurological disorders as well as methods for treating these conditions. The two series of drugs are based loosely
on the first-generation cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine. Physostigmine has produced demonstrable but
small clinical improvements in patient's with Alzheimer's disease, but these are severely limited by (i) its short
half-life (approximately 30 minutes) and (ii) its high incidence of toxic side-effects at doses that produce only
modest enzyme inhibition. It is widely accepted that the narrow therapeutic index of physostigmine and some other
first generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors limits the administration of these at adequate doses to affect
cognition. The present drug candidates are long-acting and highly selective for acetyl- (AChE) as opposed to butyrylcholinesterase
(BChE). Whereas AChE is involved in the metabolism of ACh, and inhibiting AChE augments the action of ACh and thereby
cholinergic function and memory in Alzheimer's disease, BChE has been proposed to be involved in lipid and phospholipid
metabolism, in permeability control and transport of ions across membranes, and in slow nerve conduction. Co-inhibition
of BChE in Alzheimer's patients, as a consequence of anticholinesterase therapy, probably is not of clinical value,
and may be deleterious.
