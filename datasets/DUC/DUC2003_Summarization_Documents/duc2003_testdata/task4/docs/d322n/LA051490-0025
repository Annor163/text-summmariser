It's a Fake!: Some art connoisseurs in Canada's New Brunswick province are 
red-faced after finding out that their prized pieces are fakes.

Gregg Robert Galbraith pleaded guilty to peddling as many as 200 forgeries to 
unsuspecting buyers, including the New Brunswick Museum, over a three-year 
period. Police said Galbraith bought paintings by unknown artists at sales in 
Montreal and Toronto for about $85, then forged the signatures or initials of 
celebrated maritime artists such as A. Y. Jackson, Jack Humphrey and Violet 
Gillett. He then sold the paintings through two reputable auctioneers for as 
much $3,420 each, netting $88,035 on the scam.GREG BRAXTON
