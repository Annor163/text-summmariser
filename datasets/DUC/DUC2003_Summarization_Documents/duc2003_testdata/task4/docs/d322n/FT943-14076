Mr Alan Bond, the failed Australian tycoon, is suing the country's Seven
television network for allegedly implying in a programme that he was faking
brain damage in an unsuccessful attempt to delay a court hearing on
allegations of art fraud. He faces a preliminary hearing in Perth
Magistrates' Court on Monday on charges of fraud relating to the sale of a
work by Monet entitled La Promenade.
