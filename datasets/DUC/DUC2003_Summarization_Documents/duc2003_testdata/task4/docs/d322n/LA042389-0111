Three men were arrested on suspicion of trying to sell $100-million worth of 
fake art masterpieces by claiming the bogus Picassos and Rembrandts were 
purchased cheaply from an Arab sheik, the FBI said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested after agents posing as art patrons negotiated to buy 
paintings from an inventory of fakes that also included purported works by 
Gauguin, Van Gogh, Degas, Renoir, Rubens and Chagall, said Chuck Latting, FBI 
supervising agent in San Francisco.

<P>
The men, Anthony Barreiro, Ernest Ray Parker Jr. and Jeff Jones, were taken 
into custody Friday at the home they share and were being held in the San 
Francisco County Jail, Latting said.
