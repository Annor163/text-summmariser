Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian businessman, has lost his application
to delay the art fraud court case being brought against him, on grounds of
ill-health. The case concerns four art fraud charges relating to the
multi-million dollar acquisition and sale of La Promenade, a French
Impressionist painting, while Mr Bond was a director of Bond Corporation in
the 1980s, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Mr Bond's lawyers, who had asked for a six-month adjournment, claimed that
Mr Bond was suffering from depression and brain damage following open-heart
surgery, and was not well enough to instruct solicitors. But Mr Ivan Brown,
a Perth-based magistrate, said yesterday that Mr Bond had chosen to spend
his time conducting business transactions, and ruled that the case should
proceed as planned on July 18.
