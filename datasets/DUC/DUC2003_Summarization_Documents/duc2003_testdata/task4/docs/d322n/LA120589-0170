Art Fraud -- There have been no allegations of fraudulent prints or paintings 
being sold by the Triangle Gallery of Beverly Hills, as erroneously reported in 
Monday's Calendar. Stanley R. Lerner, owner of the Triangle Gallery, is a major 
witness against Lee Sonnier, former manager of the Rodeo Drive branch of the 
Upstairs Gallery in Beverly Hills, and Frank De Marigny of Manhattan Beach. 
Sonnier and De Marigny are both charged with conspiring to sell and distribute 
fraudulent artworks.
