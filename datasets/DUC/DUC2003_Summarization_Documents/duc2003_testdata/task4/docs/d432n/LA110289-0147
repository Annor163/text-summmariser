METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF WARNS DEPUTIES ABOUT ACTIVIST'S 
'STINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block has warned Los Angeles County deputies to beware of a 
former Hawthorne police officer whose videotaped "stings" of officers have 
angered law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Block, in a memorandum to sheriff patrols, alerted deputies about any "contact 
with Don Jackson" after the activist attempted to conduct a sting operation 
last Friday against sheriff's deputies in the Lennox area. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 31, who says police often use excessive force against minorities, 
confirmed Wednesday that he and a passenger armed with a videotape camera drove 
through that area in the early morning to see if deputies would stop them 
without cause. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Jackson said he was stopped that night by California Highway Patrol 
officers who accused him of weaving across the double-yellow line. Jackson said 
he was stopped illegally -- a claim that a CHP spokesman later disputed. 
Jackson was given a field sobriety test before being released. 
</P>
<P>
That incident prompted Block's memorandum warning deputies of Jackson's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he intends to continue his efforts to "send a message to law 
enforcement that these illegal stops will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew 
surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to 
slam Jackson's head through a shop window after a traffic stop.
