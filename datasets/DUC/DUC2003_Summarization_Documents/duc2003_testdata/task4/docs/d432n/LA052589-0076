METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JACKSON FILES CLAIM IN VIDEOTAPED ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Activist Don Jackson filed a claim this week against the city of Long Beach, 
asking for damages arising from a nationally publicized incident in which an 
officer allegedly pushed Jackson through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, received Wednesday by the city clerk, asks for unspecified damages 
after Jackson and a colleague, Jeffrey C. Hill, were "illegally detained, 
arrested, cited and criminally charged on fictional accounts in police reports 
and criminally prosecuted in bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
The claim stems from the Jan. 14 incident in which Jackson, a former Hawthorne 
police sergeant, and Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, were 
stopped by two officers as they drove along Pacific Coast Highway. They had 
come to Long Beach with an NBC television crew to conduct a "sting" amid 
reports that the city's police were racist and brutal. 
</P>
<P>
The crew videotaped Officer Mark Dickey as he appeared to smash Jackson's head 
through a storefront window and throw him onto the hood of patrol car. Dickey 
and fellow officer Mark Ramsey now face misdemeanor charges of filing a false 
report. Dickey alone is charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey and Ramsey are among those named in the claim, which alleges that 
Jackson and Hill were deprived of their civil rights and subjected to false 
arrest, racism and brutality.
