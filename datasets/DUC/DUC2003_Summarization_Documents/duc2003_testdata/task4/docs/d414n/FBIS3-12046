  [Text] The INTERFAX press agency reported today that the 
Russian Government has reduced the amount of oil earmarked for 
countries of the former Soviet Union in order to send it to 
Cuba. The source added that due to a request by the Russian 
Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, this year, 2.5 million tons 
of oil will be earmarked for Cuba in exchange for 1 million tons 
of sugar, which will serve partially to meet national needs. 
  On 24 December 1993 in Moscow, Russian and Cuban delegations 
agreed to exchange 2.5 million tons of petroleum for 1 million 
tons of sugar through a joint enterprise in charge of carrying 
out the transaction.
