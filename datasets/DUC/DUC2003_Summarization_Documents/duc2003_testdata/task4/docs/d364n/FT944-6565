FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Unsound bite
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the tale that stops the dog wagging. As Observer reported last week,
Beijing's city fathers are trying to bring in draconian laws to curb
dog-ownership.
But the dogs only have themselves to blame; last year in Beijing alone
52,000 people were bitten. Now The Workers' Daily has reported that in the
past six years some 60,000 people have died of rabies throughout China.
This suggests a dog-bites-humans problem on a fairly big scale, but then
numbers in China are always mind-stretching. It seems there are more than
100m dogs in China, of which a mere 10m are pets, and the remainder are bred
to be eaten. No wonder they want to get their retaliation in first.
