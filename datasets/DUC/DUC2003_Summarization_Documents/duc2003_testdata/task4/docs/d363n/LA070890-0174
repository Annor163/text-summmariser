Turkish political leaders led a growing outcry against Saudi Arabia over the 
death of an estimated 1,426 Muslim pilgrims trampled or suffocated in a tunnel 
in Mecca while on a pilgrimage, or hajj, to Islam's holiest shrine. 
</P>
<P>
A Turkish survivor said escape routes from the tunnel were closed with wire and 
soldiers fled instead of aiding the 50,000 trapped and panic-stricken pilgrims. 
Turkey, with 550 dead and Indonesia with 122 bore the brunt of the loss. 
Malaysia, which lost 122 pilgrims, declared Monday a day of mourning.
