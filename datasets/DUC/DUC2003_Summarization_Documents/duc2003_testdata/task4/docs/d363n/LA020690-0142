A fire broke out today in a train tunnel underneath the block-long 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in mid-town Manhattan, sending smoke into the lobby of 
the hotel and halting trains on a major commuter line just hours before the 
evening rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 14 employees on the Metro North commuter line, which operates out 
of Grand Central Station, suffered smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Rail officials feared the fire could have halted train service for several 
hours and play havoc with commuters trying to get home during the evening rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel spokesmen said there was no damage to the hotel and that the smoke was 
quickly cleared from the lobby. The fire was quickly extinguished.
