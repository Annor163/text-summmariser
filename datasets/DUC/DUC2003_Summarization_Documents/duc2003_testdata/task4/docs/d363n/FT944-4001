FT  10 DEC 94 / Car fire leads to evacuation of Channel tunnel train
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of Channel tunnel train passengers were evacuated yesterday after a
car caught fire just after vehicle loading was completed at the tunnel's
Folkestone terminal in Kent.
No passenger was hurt and no other vehicle was damaged.
The incident could mean a slight postponement in Eurotunnel's being granted
a full operating licence for the Le Shuttle car service which is running on
an invitation-only basis.
Last night a report on the incident was being studied by the Anglo-French
intergovernmental commission - the body which grants the licences for the
various tunnel services.
The alert happened soon after 10am when a Ford Escort on the upper deck of
the train caught fire. As soon as the blaze broke out the train crew closed
fireproof doors to isolate the fire within one wagon.
Passengers were then evacuated as fire crews dealt with the blaze.
There were further problems for Eurotunnel later when a freight shuttle
train stalled in the tunnel for 20 minutes - delaying other services
including a high-speed Eurostar train.
