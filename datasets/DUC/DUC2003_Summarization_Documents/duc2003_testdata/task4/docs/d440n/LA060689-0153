The lawsuit charges that Stamford, Conn.-based Eastern Hospitality Inc. has 
violated provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standard Act since 1986 by 
employing 14- and 15-year-olds to work more than the hours permitted under 
federal law and has illegally hired workers, ages 14 through 17, to operate and 
clean power-driven meat-slicing machines.

Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the plaintiff on behalf of the Labor 
Department, is seeking a court injunction to halt the alleged violations and to 
secure back overtime pay for 134 workers, court papers said.
