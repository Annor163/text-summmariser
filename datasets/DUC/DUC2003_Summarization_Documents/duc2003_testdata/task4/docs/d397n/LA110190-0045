Dealers will be asked to install free of charge a vacuum retard delay valve and 
change the ignition timing. Cars affected were built for sale in the 49 states, 
with California and Canadian vehicles not affected. Vehicle emission testing 
conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and Ford indicated that carbon 
monoxide exhaust emission levels are unacceptable at high altitudes and 
hydrocarbon levels are unacceptable at low altitudes.
