Ford Motor Co. said today that it is recalling about 101,000 Aerostar vans from 
the 1986-model year to replace seals between the fuel tank and filler pipe. The 
recall involves vans made between November, 1985, and May, 1986, Ford said, 
adding that it had received an unspecified number of complaints of fuel leakage 
and gasoline odors in those models and that a potential for fuel leakage occurs 
when the tank is full or nearly full.
