Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. today announced the recall of about 33,000 1987-90 
model Nissan Vans to replace power-steering hoses that could leak and cause an 
engine- compartment fire. 
</P>
<P>
The auto maker said it is aware of only one minor injury resulting from the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan will make all repairs free of charge at authorized dealers after owners 
are notified by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan discontinued sales of its Van model this year. The Nissan Axxess van is 
not affected by the recall.
