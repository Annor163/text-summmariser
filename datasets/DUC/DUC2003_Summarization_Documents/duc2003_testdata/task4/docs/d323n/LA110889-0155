Humorist Art Buchwald will call several prominent Hollywood writers, including 
director-screenwriter Billy Wilder, as expert witnesses in his plagiarism 
lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the $5-million suit, set for trial in state court next month, Buchwald 
contends that the Eddie Murphy movie "Coming to America" is similar to an idea 
called "King for a Day" that the columnist came up with in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Both stories involve African princes who come to the United States and fall in 
love. 
</P>
<P>
The studio has denied the plagiarism allegations. Late last month, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider denied a motion by Paramount to dismiss 
the lawsuit.
