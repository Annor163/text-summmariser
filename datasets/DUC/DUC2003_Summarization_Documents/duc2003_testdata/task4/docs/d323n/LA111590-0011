Allegations about King's extramarital exploits and recent charges of plagiarism 
of his college papers take nothing away from his accomplishments as the 
lightning rod for black Americans seeking government recognition of their 
endowed, unalienable rights. What it does is support those who felt more time 
was needed to study King's life and background before he was honored with 
national and state holidays.

<P>
Black giants like Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and Frederick 
Douglass may be even more suitable subjects to honor with a holiday or other 
recognition because their lives have withstood the test of historical scrutiny.
