Two men were killed this morning when the speeding Corvette they were in 
crashed through a concrete barrier on an elevated section of the Golden State 
Freeway and plummeted 100 feet to a field below, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The car shot off of there like a rocket," CHP Officer Dave Grajeda said of the 
2:40 a.m. accident on the curving transition road from the northbound Golden 
State Freeway to the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The car flew out 90 feet and then down 100," Grajeda said. "Both occupants 
weren't wearing seat belts and were ejected. The passenger landed on top of the 
driver and the car landed on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Corvette was driven by a 37-year-old Los Angeles man whose name was 
not released pending notification of his family. The driver died shortly after 
the accident at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. The passenger, who 
had no identification, died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said there were no witnesses to the accident but the investigation 
showed that the car was going faster than 100 m.p.h. when the driver attempted 
to take the curve onto the Simi Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"That is way too fast for that curve," Grajeda said. "He lost control and 
crashed through the barrier. Fortunately, it was open space below. No homes." 
</P>
<P>
Grajeda said investigators detected the odor of alcohol at the crash site but 
will have to await autopsy results to determine if the driver had been 
drinking.
