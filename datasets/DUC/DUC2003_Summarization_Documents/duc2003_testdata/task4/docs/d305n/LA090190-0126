Drivers protected by air bags are significantly less vulnerable to head and 
chest injury in accidents, new tests indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Results released Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
indicated that a front-seat passenger in the Chrysler LeBaron two-door 
convertible is nearly seven times as likely to sustain head injury as the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chrysler Imperial, a four-door sedan, the passenger is four times as 
vulnerable as the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Both cars have air bags on the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
The agency tested 34 vehicles ranging from subcompacts to luxury sedans and 
light trucks, releasing its final round of crash test results for 1990 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said it was difficult to draw conclusions from 
the tests because they were based on crashes under conditions that exceed 
government safety standards, but he said air bags have a major impact on safety 
and are needed for passengers as well as drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (in the auto industry) has indicated that's the direction they're 
going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The government tested the vehicles by driving them head-on into a fixed 
barrier, creating the same conditions as a frontal collision between two 
identical vehicles driving at 35 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions also are equivalent to a car moving at 70 m.p.h. striking an 
identical parked car. 
</P>
<P>
Test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and, in certain cars, air 
bags. Tests are conducted using dummies that represent an average-size adult 
male. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NHTSA index, a score of 750 or lower means head injury is 
unlikely; 750 to 1,250 means head injury is possible, and anything higher means 
head injury is likely. 
</P>
<P>
A separate scale records the possibility of chest injury, which is considered 
likely when the score tops 60. 
</P>
<P>
The lower the numbers, the lower the potential for injury. But for purposes of 
comparison, vehicles have to be of the same type and weigh within 500 pounds of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler LeBaron's score for driver head injury was 298, well below the 
threshold for likely injury. But the front-seat passenger score was 2,043. 
Chest injury scores were 40 for the driver and 46 for the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
In the Imperial, the driver head injury score was 517 while the passenger head 
injury score was 2,132. 
</P>
<P>
Rated highest of all vehicles tested for potential driver head injury was the 
Ford Club Wagon van, with a score of 2,613. Its passenger score was 1,896. 
</P>
<P>
The Isuzu Trooper II had the highest potential injury score for the front-seat 
passenger -- 1,952. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevrolet S-10 Blazer had the highest driver chest injury score -- 74. The 
highest passenger injury score was the Trooper II's 64. 
</P>
<P>
The agency released eight crash test results Friday, including those of the 
Imperial and LeBaron. Others included: 
</P>
<P>
* Chevrolet Cavalier four-door sedan. Head injury: 770 driver, 485 passenger. 
Chest injury: 49 driver, 37 passenger.
