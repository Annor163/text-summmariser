'DEATH ALLEY' TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO BLINK RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Existing traffic lights on a treacherous stretch of Lampson Avenue in Seal 
Beach will be adjusted to flash red continuously from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. every 
night, a step ordered by the City Council after two fatal crashes there. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach Police Chief Bill Stearns said the stretch, Lampson Avenue from 
Heather Street to Candleberry Avenue, will also be posted with lighted or 
reflectorized signs setting the speed limit at 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, two men have died on that curve, known as "the alley 
of death." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Henry Vasquez, 19, of Norwalk died Sunday when his Jeep struck two power 
poles and overturned. Michael Clines, 19, of Seal Beach was killed Aug. 23 when 
his car struck and sheared off two of the trees that divide Lampson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated Clines' speed at 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The accidents brought renewed calls from residents of an adjacent residential 
tract for a reduced speed limit along that stretch, and for reinforcement of 
the wall that separates their homes from the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't stop the people from speeding, then we have to protect the 
residents," Patty Campbell told the Seal Beach City Council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said she is sometimes awakened by jolts caused by buses or trucks 
speeding along Lampson Avenue past her home. Some cars have crashed through the 
wall along the avenue, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns said that most accidents in the area have involved speeds in excess of 
65 m.p.h., and usually have occurred during late-night or early-morning hours. 
The police chief said that some drivers try to see "how fast they can take the 
curve and survive." 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered that the traffic lights begin blinking red, effective 
immediately.
