Scientists at Hammsmith Hospital in London say they have been able to select 
3-day-old test-tube embryos that are destined to become girls and implant them 
in women, including two who are expecting twins this summer. Further research 
might provide a way to screen out embryos that would be expected to develop 
serious genetic diseases, removing the prospect of abortions in those cases, 
researchers said.

The study was aimed at producing female babies in cases where a male could 
inherit one of the 200 serious genetic diseases that affect only males, said 
researcher Alan Handyside.

The embryo analysis involves collecting eggs from a woman, fertilizing them in 
a test tube and letting them grow to eight-cell embryos. A single cell is 
removed from each embryo to see if it contains a bit of genetic material that 
indicates the presence of a Y chromosome, which would mean the embryo is 
destined to become a boy.
