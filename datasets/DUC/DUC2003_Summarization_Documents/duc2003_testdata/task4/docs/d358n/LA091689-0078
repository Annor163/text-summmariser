A Santa Barbara carpenter received a 21-years-to-life prison sentence Friday 
for driving drunk and causing a crash that killed a Sylmar woman and seriously 
injured three people. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Edward Dewey, 36, was convicted in June by a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
of second-degree murder in the May 21, 1988, crash that killed Sylvia Martinez, 
39. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Dewey had four prior convictions for driving under the influence of 
alcohol, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles levied the maximum 
sentence of 15 years to life. Mireles added a consecutive six-year prison term 
for two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, causing great bodily 
harm and one count of driving with an expired license.

<P>
"It's stiff," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca DeWees, "but if this man goes 
back on the street, he's going to kill someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Rand S. Rubin, Dewey's attorney, had asked that his client be sentenced to 
probation and ordered to attend an alcohol-treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing, Dewey told the judge he wished he "could turn back the hands 
of time. I'm very, very sorry," he said. "None of this should ever have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
But Marta Calderon, 29, the driver of the car in which Martinez was a 
passenger, told the judge: "He's saying he's sorry, but it's too late." She 
said that she lost an eye and that her daughter, then 8 months old, suffered a 
broken leg and had to undergo brain surgery as a result of the accident. 
Another passenger suffered stomach, neck and head injuries and required plastic 
surgery, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey was traveling at 70 m.p.h. when he drove his truck into the back of 
Calderon's car at Hubbard Street and Eldridge Avenue in Sylmar, DeWees said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of a blood sample obtained from Dewey after the accident showed a 
blood-alcohol level of .27%, nearly three times the state's legal standard for 
drunkenness, she added.
