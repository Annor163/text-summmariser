The dangers of the sun have been well chronicled in this health-conscious
age. But how do you know when harmful rays can bring on the burn?
NTT America, part of Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, has brought out
what it calls 'an early warning system for your skin and eyes'. This is
claimed to be the first re-usable ultra-violet sensing self-adhesive patch
that screens harmful UV-B and UV-A rays and gives immediate information on
the protection needed.
The patch can be re-used more than 1,000 times. 'It alerts the user to the
risk of over exposure and painful sunburn before the damage is done,' says
Hideo Yamamoto, vice president of technology transfer. NTT America: US, 212
808 2251.
