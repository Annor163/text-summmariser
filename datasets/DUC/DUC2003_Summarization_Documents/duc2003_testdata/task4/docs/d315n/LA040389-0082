</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wrong-way driver was fatally injured on the Orange Freeway just north of 
Katella Avenue about 4:10 p.m. Sunday when his northbound car plowed head-on 
into a southbound pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong-way driver was identified by the county coroner's office as Edward 
Phillips, 76, of Laguna Hills, who was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange with 
"moderate injuries," said the CHP, which identified him only as a 48-year-old 
Placentia man. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Phillips car became northbound in the southbound lanes. 
The CHP said investigators could not determine why or how the car got into the 
flow against traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Several people (driving on the freeway) said they had to take evasive action 
to avoid being hit by him," a CHP dispatcher said.
