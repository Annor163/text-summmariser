A Costa Mesa man thrown from a car was in critical condition Thursday and two 
others were being treated for major injuries after a head-on collision on 
Irvine Avenue.

Robert K. Elliott, 21, suffered serious head injuries after he was ejected from 
the 1972 Porsche his friend was driving.

The accident occurred about 6:30 p.m. on the winding section of Irvine Avenue 
just north of Private Road, police said. Dale Cross, 22, who was driving, 
apparently lost control and drove over the center divider into oncoming 
traffic, police said.

That car collided with Paul Dolkas' 1969 silver Porsche, then careened into a 
Volkswagen and a Mercedes-Benz.

Elliott and Cross, also of Costa Mesa, were taken to United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, where Cross was in stable condition after suffering head and 
leg injuries.

Dolkas, 35, of Newport Beach was in serious condition Thursday after being 
airlifted to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.

Officer Robert Oakley said Cross worked at Coast Detailing shop in Newport 
Beach, where the Porsche had been brought for detailing. Cross did not have 
permission to drive the car, Oakley said.
