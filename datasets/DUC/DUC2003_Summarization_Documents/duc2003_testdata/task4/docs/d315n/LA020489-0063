 DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH WON'T BE CHARGED

</HEADLINE>

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has announced that it will 
not prosecute a 70-year-old Sherman Oaks driver whose car rammed into a crowded 
Monterey Park restaurant, crushing two people to death and injuring the driver 
and four others. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Eastman called the Dec. 28 accident a tragedy but said 
he concluded after a review of the case that driver Rudy D'Agostin committed no 
crime. It is unclear why D'Agostin lost control of his car and crashed into the 
Four Happiness Restaurant on Garfield Avenue, Eastman said, although "age and 
medical problems caused (D'Agostin) to really have no idea what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, Eastman said, that D'Agostin had suffered a mild stroke before 
the accident. He had been missing from home for two days, Eastman said, and at 
1:35 a.m., about 15 hours before the accident, a Burbank policeman had stopped 
D'Agostin for running a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that D'Agostin was not intoxicated, he said.
