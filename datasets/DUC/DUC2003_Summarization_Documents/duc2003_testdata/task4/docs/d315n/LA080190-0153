Former Rams linebacker Carl Ekern was killed in a single-vehicle traffic 
accident in the Mojave Desert early today, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by found Ekern's vehicle overturned alongside U.S. 395 about 4 a.m., 
CHP Officer Chris Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, 36, had been thrown from the car and apparently died of head injuries, 
Geiger added. 
</P>
<P>
The investigating officer said the northbound car had run off the highway at an 
unknown speed sometime during the night, then over-corrected across both lanes 
and struck a small dirt berm. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, the vehicle became airborne and rolled several times," Geiger 
said. "During that time, he (Ekern) was ejected and received what appeared to 
be fatal head injuries." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 125 miles northeast of Los Angeles in Kern County, 
seven miles south of Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern lived in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern was selected in the fifth-round of the 1976 draft and played for the Rams 
until retiring after the 1988 season. He became a starter in 1981 and was 
selected to the Pro Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter at San Jose State, Ekern was named the Pacific Coast 
Athletic Assn.'s player of the year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern had been a Ram starter at inside linebacker from 1981 until his 
retirement last year. 
</P>
<P>
He led the team in tackles three times and was named to the Pro Bowl in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Although not blessed with great size and speed, Ekern proved durable in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not big, fast, strong and he's not a great athlete, Rams defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmer once said. "He's just a a gifted football player." 
</P>
<P>
And the smartest player he has ever known, Shurmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern made up for physical liabilities by succeeding in the classroom. He was 
methodical in his approach to the game, studying films astutely. 
</P>
<P>
"So many guys look at film and don't know what they're seeing," Shurmer said. 
"It's like they're watching like a fan." 
</P>
<P>
He said Ekern knew what to look for, how a back lined up so he could cheat in 
his alignment. 
</P>
<P>
The night before every game, Ekern wrote summary reports about his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern served as the Rams' elected representative to the NFL Players Assn.
