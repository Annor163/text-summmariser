A 26-year-old Huntington Beach woman was killed when the vehicle she was riding 
in went off a scenic southern Utah road and crashed, National Park Service 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Eckroth died of injuries suffered in the one-vehicle accident Sunday 
on the Burr Trail, about 40 miles north of the Utah-Arizona state line, said 
Karen Whitney, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering minor injuries in the accident were Michael Sterger, the driver, and 
Gina Sterger, both of Cypress, and Donald Dudrey, 30, of Garden Grove, Whitney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigating officers said the vehicle veered off the dirt road and struck an 
embankment and a large rock, throwing Eckroth from the back seat through the 
front windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Eckroth was given emergency treatment, then flown by helicopter to a Page, 
Ariz., hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
The other three people were treated and released, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Eckroth's death was the fifth accidental fatality this year among visitors to 
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. She was the first to die in a traffic 
accident, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Three people, including two children, drowned, and one death was the result of 
a hiker falling from a cliff.
