As the Board of Supervisors looked at alternative ways of getting rid of 
millions of old car tires, one supervisor, Roger R. Stanton, warned Tuesday of 
another product that might pose future problems for the county's landfills -- 
disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to warn staff I will be asking for an additional study about a 
problem regarding a product that we all don't use, at least I hope not, and 
that's disposable diapers," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I understand from studies that have been made available to my staff . . . 
(disposable diapers) make up 2% of the solid waste that we have to deal with in 
this county." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley pointed out that 42,000 children were born 
during the county's Centennial Year, implying that the new babies accounted for 
a lot of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
After the discussion, the board voted unanimously to study waste-to-energy 
options for disposing of the 2 million tires each year taken to county 
landfills. Tires, which account for one-half of 1% of the area's solid waste, 
have long been a nuisance at the landfills, and because of their bulkiness they 
often pop to the surface after being buried. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also directed county staff to: 
</P>
<P>
* Work with other Southern California counties to develop a regional approach 
for disposing of unusable tires. 
</P>
<P>
* Solicit proposals to recycle old tires into useful raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
* Continue to explore implementation of a county-operated tire-shredding 
program. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are also looking into waste-to-energy disposal of the tires 
through pyrolysis (chemical decomposition using heat) and incineration. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have also proposed a new ordinance that would make it illegal to 
dispose of tires anywhere but at designated dump sites. GEORGE FRANK
