  [Text] Issues of cooperation in carrying out 
remote-controlled probing of the Earth from space and developing 
satellite telecommunications systems will be the subject of the 
forthcoming talks between representatives of the space agencies 
of Ukraine and the United States in April. This was a report 
from the National Space Agency of Ukraine. 
  The intention of the Ukrainian side is to offer NASA a radar 
to study the surface of the ocean, developed by specialists of 
the Pivdenne design bureau, as well as the Paton Institute's 
technology of electric welding and construction assembling in 
space.
