The International Maritime Organisation, an arm of the United Nations,
yesterday announced plans to establish a panel of safety experts to
recommend action following the sinking in the Baltic last Wednesday of the
car ferry Estonia with the loss of more than 900 lives. The proposal by
IMO's secretary-general, Mr William O'Neil, is unprecedented in the
organisation's 35-year history and is intended to shorten its frequently
lengthy procedures. Even so, a final decision to go ahead with the panel
will not be taken until its safety committee meets in two months. The panel
would be headed by Mr Giuliano Pattofatto, an Italian naval architect and
chairman of the IMO's safety committee. It would consist of representatives
of member governments and outside experts and would be likely to present its
recommendations next May. The UK department of transport's marine safety
agency said it would ask its surveyors to check the bow doors of all ro-ro
passenger ferries operating out of UK ports.
