Maritime representatives of more than 80 nations yesterday gave unanimous
backing to proposals for the establishment of a special international panel
to look at issues of roll-on roll-off passenger ferry safety. The panel,
established at the suggestion of Mr William O'Neil, secretary general of the
London-based International Maritime Organisation, will hold its first
meeting on Saturday. It has been set up as a means of circumventing the
IMO's sometimes lengthy procedures following the sinking of the ferry
Estonia with the loss of more than 900 lives in September.
