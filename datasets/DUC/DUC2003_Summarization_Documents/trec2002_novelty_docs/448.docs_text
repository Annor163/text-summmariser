<s docid="FT922-1727" num="35"> But Port Isaac is about as close to the ideal as you can come these days.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="36"> Here on the rugged North Cornwall coast, a 40-minute drive around the Camel estuary from Padstow, topography and a local conservation order have saved Port Isaac from over-development.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="37"> There is no coastal road along this shore, for unlike other parts of Cornwall there are few sheltered harbours, sandy beaches or means of access to the sea.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="38"> Precipitous 200-ft cliffs range the shoreline; sturdy sheep, occasional cliff-path walkers and the odd tractor are the only company you will run across.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="39"> July and August see an influx of summer tourists to Port Isaac, but even that has its limits.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="40"> Built into a rocky, high-sided inlet, the village and everything about it is steep and tiny.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="41"> Seventeenth-century slate and stone houses built on different levels cluster round a miniature walled harbour.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="42"> Crooked lanes tail away into stepped footpaths.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="43"> With many streets barely 6 ft wide, parking near the port is impossible except in the harbour-floor 'tidal parking lot' - an option with nasty consequences for all but the shortest of short-term holiday-makers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="44"> If topography is one limitation to tourism, so is weather.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="45"> This is one of the windiest places in Britain - so windy, in fact, that the country's first electricity-generating wind-farm, a futuristic vision of vast, winged turbines, sits not far inland.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="46"> An ever-present, inescapable element, the wind batters the cliffs, deforms bushes into ragged, lop-sided shapes, and brings in ocean storms with lightning speed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="47"> But for those who like the wilder, more unpredictable side of nature, cliff, sea, wind and storm all make for a grand show.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="48"> I began not with a natural, but a human show.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="49"> After breakfast I set off in a blustery wind for Tintagel - better known to lovers of Arthurian legend as Camelot - half-an-hour away by car.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="50"> Although there is not much left of the castle at Tintagel, its site is romantic enough.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="51"> Perched high over the roaring sea on a headland connected to the shore by the thinnest neck of rock, it is a wild place where, among crags and ruins, one can imagine Arthur and his knights gathered at the Round Table.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="52"> Unfortunately, not a scrap of evidence exists to show that King Arthur ever set foot in the place.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="53"> If it was the 12th-century Geoffrey of Monmouth who invented the famous legends several hundred years after Arthur was supposed to have lived, and Thomas Mallory who popularised them some 300 years after that, it was a visit to Tintagel by Tennyson, and his subsequent Morte d'Arthur, that linked this place to the myth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="54"> More unfortunately still, the Round Table in Tintagel these days is not a round table at all, but a bandwagon.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="55"> The town's King Arthur's Hall of Chivalry is only the beginning of it.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="56"> As I walked back from the castle to my car, I passed just a few of the establishments cashing in on the legend: King Arthur's Bookshop, King Arthur's Cafe, the Pendragon Gallery, Merlin's Gift Shop, the King Arthur's Arms.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="57"> If there is a Chinese laundry in Tintagel, it probably has an Arthurian name.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="58"> Very different was a long cliff walk the next day around Pentire Point and along the Camel river estuary to the Padstow ferry.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="59"> It is a hike that took me through some of the most colourful, and this time authentic, chapters of Cornish tradition.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="60"> This was once one of the most dangerous coasts in England.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="61"> From St Ives Bay to the Devon border extends a rocky, exposed shore which, for more than 80 miles, has no safe harbour where ships could run in rough weather.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="62"> Sailing vessels were wrecked along here by the hundreds, and the Cornish population developed as fearsome a reputation for 'wrecking' as for smuggling.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="63"> Wreckers were opportunists who, from the cliff-tops, would follow a ship in trouble until it foundered and was driven ashore, then strip it of everything from cargo to cabin doors.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="64"> There are many dark tales of wreckers deliberately luring ships to destruction.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="65"> On stormy nights, it is said, they would tie a lamp to a cow's tail and send it wandering off along the cliffs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="66"> Swinging to and fro like a ship's masthead light, it would draw vessels and their crews to certain death.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="67"> Padstow Bay and the mouth of the Camel estuary would appear to be one of the few safe havens along this coast, but in fact it was one of the most dangerous traps of all.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="68"> This is the site of the dreaded Doom Bar, a broad expanse of sand stretching across the estuary mouth, through which only one narrow deepwater channel existed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="69"> If the name of that worthy organisation, the Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property from Shipwreck, was somewhat long and awkward for use in split-second emergencies, it was none the less successful in rescuing many a mariner from a watery end on the Doom Bar.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="70"> I saw no wrecks on the day I walked along the sands at low tide, just the wind-whipped little church of Saint Enodoc, where John Betjeman is buried, and scores of bright orange and yellow wind-surfers making spectacular leaps over the waves of Padstow Bay.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="71"> While the town of Padstow may no longer have to save vast numbers of sailors, it continues an equally admirable service; at Granny's Pasty Shop near the waterfront it makes a pasty that any Cornishman would be proud of.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="72"> The most pleasurable part of a stay in Port Isaac, though, is simply spending time around Port Isaac itself.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="73"> Not even dirty weather detracts from the atmosphere; it adds to it.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="74"> Down at the tiny harbour, locals stand about stacked lobster pots in the drizzle, talking fish.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="75"> In the Port Isaac fisherman's co-op you can take refuge from spring gales and buy some of the finest cooked crabs around.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="76"> In the Golden Lion on wet and foggy Saturday nights you can sip a pint and listen to wildly Celtic fiddle-playing.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1727" num="77"> And on the hill at a wind-battered house called Dunoon, of course, you can practise your Spanish with a man who would give it all up, just for a bit of sunshine.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="7"> THE COMPANY which operates the Braer, the Liberian-registered tanker which lies wrecked and spilling oil on the coast of Shetland, last night defended the master and crew of the ship against criticism of their handling of the emergency.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="8"> Mr Mike Hudner, chief executive of the B&H group, the New York-based operator, said: 'Suggestions that the crew should have remained on board as the ship went aground conflict with our belief that human life takes priority over all other considerations.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="9"> 'The safety of the crew must come first.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="10"> The coastguard authorities are in no doubt that the total evacuation of the ship was absolutely necessary to guarantee their survival'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="11"> He was speaking after critical comments from the owner of a tug sent to aid the stricken vessel on Tuesday morning as it was being blown on to the rocks by force 10 winds.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="12"> The tug owner, Mr Barry Cork, had expressed anger that when his tug had reached the Braer no one was available on the tanker for two hours to try to take a tow line.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="13"> Mr Hudner also defended the route taken by the ship on its voyage from Norway to Canada, which ran through the 22-mile-wide channel between Sumburgh and Fair Isle where it was hit by storm-force winds.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="14"> Oil was continuing to pour from the Braer's punctured tanks yesterday as a pollution control operation began.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="15"> The wind had subsided since Tuesday but it was still blowing from a westerly direction, confining much of the oil slick to Quendale Bay where the ship lies.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="16"> The Braer had shifted slightly since Tuesday and though its stern is underwater with the bow above the water it appears that its back has not been broken.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="17"> About half the oil on board may have already leaked out.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="18"> Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the Marine Accident Investigation Branch would hold an inquiry.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="19"> Lord Caithness, shipping minister, said the inquiry would exceed the usual investigation of shipwrecks.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="20"> Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office environment and agriculture minister, said Shetland would not be 'out of pocket' as a result of the disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="21"> He was studying possible compensation for farmers for damage to grazing caused by oil from the tanker showering their land.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="22"> Yesterday, five Dakota aircraft of the Department of Transport's marine pollution unit sprayed dispersant chemicals around the ship and on the surrounding oil slick which is between four and five miles long.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="23"> But the sea was still too rough to deploy booms to prevent the oil entering coastal inlets.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="24"> There was also criticism of the Braer's mixed Greek and Filipino crew, sailing under a Greek master, after an apparent delay in summoning help from Shetland coast guards when the tanker suffered engine failure.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="25"> Mr Hudner said the Braer was 'blacked out' - losing electrical power when the engines failed - at 4.40am and was in touch with the coast guards at 5.05am.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="26"> It ordered up a tug at 5.19am.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="27"> The delay between contacting the coast guard and ordering the tug was caused by the master's need to contact B&H in New York, which would in turn have contacted the ship's insurance underwriter.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="28"> But Mr Hudner did not regard this as a meaningful delay.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="29"> Mr Jean Gaulin, chairman and chief executive of Ultramar, the oil company which owns the Braer's 84,000 tonne cargo, said the ship had Dollars 700m (Pounds 460.5m) of insurance cover, which he believed was sufficient to cover the cost of damage.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="30"> In order to win awards of over Dollars 83m claimants would need to prove the owner guilty of gross negligence - breaching the terms of international conventions limiting owners' liability.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="31"> Robert Gibbens in Montreal writes: Ultramar has obtained a writ to seize the Celtic, a sister ship of the crippled Braer, from B&H Shipping.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="32"> Ultramar said it was a protective move to ensure that, as the owner of the Braer's oil cargo, it would be reimbursed for any loss.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16443" num="33"> It has also filed a Dollars 25m claim against the company.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="7"> Drakes Bay is, beyond all reasonable doubt, the place on the California coast where Sir Francis Drake careened and repaired the Golden Hind in 1595 before setting sail for England and home, we learned the other day, reading the latest copy of the Smithsonian Institution Research Reports.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="8"> The endless debate over the authenticity of the site is over.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="9"> The early historians, who first proposed the location, have been proven correct.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="10"> The report inspired us to talk with the two scholars who produced the last bit of evidence that clinched the case.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="11"> They had sorted out the mystery through Ming Dynasty shards found among Coast Miwok tribe relics at the Point Reyes National Seashore that now embraces Drakes Bay.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="12"> It was Clarence F.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="13"> Shangraw, chief curator of the Museum of Asian Art in San Francisco, who made the first spectacular discovery.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="14"> He found that the 708 bits and pieces of what once had been 235 cups, bowls, plates and a vase were from two distinct periods of manufacture, some made in the mid 1570s, some made 20 years later, in the mid-1590s.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="15"> He was able to date each shard and specify where in China it had been made.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="16"> Then Edward P.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="17"> Von der Porten, director of the Treasure Island Museum, made the second discovey: The older shards showed no signs of sea damage, even though they were finer and more delicate.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="18"> But those made around 1595 had been worn in the way that pounding surf and sand smooth rough edges.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="19"> "Two totally independent methods of analysis gave us identical answers," Von der Porten said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="20"> The answers, they reported, are clear: The older shards had to have been carried carefully ashore.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="21"> They could only have come from Drake's ship.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="22"> They had to be from the crates of precious Chinese ceramics logged aboard the Golden Hind when they were pirated by Drake from Spanish outposts and ships along the Central American Coast of the Pacific Ocean on the voyage before he reached Point Reyes.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="23"> Records make clear that the crates were not aboard when the Golden Hind returned to England.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="24"> As Drake consolidated his supplies for the long voyage home, he must reluctantly have lightened cargo and left the dishes for the Indians to use.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="25"> The ceramics made a generation later must have been aboard the San Agustin, a Spanish trading vessel plying the Pacific between Acapulco and Manila.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="26"> It had been blown far off course and then sank in a terrible storm at Drakes Bay on Nov. 30, 1595.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="27"> Efforts to locate the wreckage, buried in centuries of accumulated sand, are now being planned.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="28"> But detailed records of the shipwreck itself permit accurate dating.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="29"> There was a lively but risky trade across the Pacific in those days, dominated by Spanish galleons running between the west coast of Mexico and the Philippines and Indonesia.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="30"> Chinese ceramics were transferred in junks from points of manufacture to the trading ports, such as Manila.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="31"> Galleons brought them to places like Acapulco.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="32"> They were carted overland to Vera Cruz for shipment to Europe where extraordinary prices were paid, even for the lower-quality goods.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="33"> Drake's booty included the finest products of Jingdezhen in south-central China, the center of fine ceramics from the 14th Century even to this day.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="34"> But the San Agustin's cargo was of poorer-quality bowls and plates made on the south coast by entrepreneurs quick to respond to the lucrative market.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="35"> The Miwok tribespeople apparently smashed most of the ceramics that came into their possession to make jewelry, even one elegant pendant, and to fashion effective tools for scraping hides.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="36"> "Each culture finds a different use," Shangraw said philosophically.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="37"> Some of the shards are now part of a traveling exhibition being shown in major museums, but Von der Porten hopes for a permanent exhibit in California one of these days.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="38"> That will help him respond to the continuing skepticism that some still express about just where it was that Drake landed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="6"> ON THE starless and stormy night of January 4 1656, the Nuestra Senora de las Maravillas - Our Lady of the Marvels - fired a cannon shot to warn the rest of its flotilla of approaching sandbanks off the Little Bahama Bank.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="7"> In the confusion that followed, the Spanish treasure galleon was rammed by its sister ship, the Concepcion.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="8"> According to Don Diego Portichuelo de Rivadeneryra, a priest on board the Maravillas: 'The Concepcion gave such a blow to our boom with her cutwater, which had been newly refitted in Havana and made of mahogany, that it broke in three pieces.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="9"> That blow broke through our planks from the top of the waterline to the holds, making splinters of all of them'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="10"> Impaled from port to starboard, wallowing in heavy seas, the Maravillas' death throes were swift.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="11"> The 40 tons of gold and silver bullion and treasure, destined to fund another of King Philip IV's interminable wars against France, dragged the 150 ft-long ship on to a coral reef.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="12"> On deck, priests were mobbed by crewmen eager to make their last confessions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="13"> Some priests demanded gold and jewels as payment, doubtless hoping to survive and enjoy Heaven on Earth as well as in the hereafter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="14"> The bow of the Maravillas went down in only 30 ft of water but massive waves ripped the stern - containing most of the treasure - away to sink elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="15"> Of the 650 people on board, only 45 lived.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="16"> Those who clung to debris were swept away by swirling currents.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="17"> Others grabbed hold of the mast and rigging that remained above water, but died from exposure and attacks by tiger sharks.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="18"> (Tiger sharks guard the wreck to this day).</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="19"> The avaricious priests plunged to the bottom, their cassocks weighted down by booty.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="20"> As the centuries passed, the shifting sands covered both bones and gold.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="21"> But 335 years later, in 40 ft of water, a crew member scuba-diving off a salvage ship, the RV Beacon, uncovered from the sunken bow section a cache of gold coins and a Spanish colonial gold pectoral cross set with 66 well-matched emeralds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="22"> The cross was auctioned at Christie's in London nine days ago, where it fetched a record Pounds 231,000.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="23"> The cross was the prize piece in a sale of 157 lots salvaged from the Maravillas, ranging from individual gold and silver coins and bars to jewellery and even a bronze signal cannon - perhaps the same one that fired that fateful shot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="24"> The sale earned the treasure hunters a total of Pounds 430,000.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="25"> But the real pay-day could be to come.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="26"> The Maravillas' manifest shows it was carrying cargo worth, in present-day terms, more than Dollars 1.6bn - but the real value could be much more, because Spanish sailors displayed great ingenuity at smuggling.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="27"> Thus, now the cross has gone under the auctioneer's hammer, the Beacon's crew are preparing to search for the mother lode.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="28"> Legend insists that, in addition to the bullion, the Maravillas' stern also contained a life-size statue of the Madonna and Child - weighing more than half a ton and cast from solid gold - plus a 400 lb gold table studded with emeralds, rubies and diamonds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="29"> If found, their value is incalculable.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="30"> Herbert Humphreys, 44, heads Marex, a Memphis-based underwater salvage company which has been diving on the galleon since 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="31"> He says the business of recovering sunken treasure can be 'boring, tedious, expensive and dangerous'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="32"> But he adds: 'It is also one of the most exciting adventures left on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="33"> To dive beneath the sea and hold in your hand a weapon, a coin, a piece of jewellery or a tool that belonged to some unknown and long-dead man or woman is an experience few people can have.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="34"> I have seen the stuff that dreams are made of'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="35"> Humphreys has been hooked on these particular dreams since, aged eight and playing on a Bahamas beach, he picked up a gold coin washed ashore by the shifting seas.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="36"> For his 16th birthday, his father - co-founder of a cooking oil company which merged, profitably, with the giant Kraft food empire in 1951 - gave him a copy of Fell's Guide to Sunken Treasure Ships of the World.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="37"> Written on the title page is the inscription: 'Hope you find Dollars 10m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="38"> Love, Dad'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="39"> Humphreys still has the well-thumbed book but, these days, his financial sights are set rather higher.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="40"> Indeed, he appears to have inherited a certain financial flair.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="41"> He had a private education which gave him all the traditional social graces and charm of the Southern gentleman, and travelled the world with his parents.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="42"> After winning a horse-jumping competition at 16, he invested the Dollars 5,500 prize money in Philippines gold stock at 25 cents a share.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="43"> He sold it a few years later at Dollars 30 a share.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="44"> At 22, he became convinced that the clear waters off the Cayman Islands would be irresistible to scuba divers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="45"> So, he negotiated a Holiday Inns' franchise for Grand Cayman at a time when there were only two other small hotels on the island.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="46"> Now, he has extensive shipping, air charter and travel businesses in the Caribbean and Memphis.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="47"> Humphreys served in Vietnam with the US Navy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="48"> He is a qualified pilot and parachutist who speaks and writes French and Italian.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="49"> Politically, he is right wing: he was a major-general in the FDN Legion, a Nicaraguan Contra organisation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="50"> His first wreck was HMS Thunderer, a British warship which went down off Honduras in 1780 carrying looted Spanish and French cargo.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="51"> It was an archaeological dream untouched for 203 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="52"> Archaeology is the key word, because Humphreys regards preservation as the first and foremost goal of treasure recovery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="53"> 'Every nail, every little pottery shard, each musket ball, literally everything we find is treasure to me.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="54"> We have an artefact preservationist on board the Beacon who dedicates himself to preserving these important time capsules of the past.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="55"> I want to share the results of our work with the public'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="56"> He employs a full-team of marine archaeologists and researchers and has already given precious metals and 17th century artefacts to museums in the Caribbean.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="57"> Inspired by his success with the Thunderer, he founded Marex (Marine Archaeological Rescue) in 1984 and persuaded the Bahamian authorities to let him excavate the Maravillas (they get 25 per cent).</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="58"> Treasure-hunting today is many microchips away from a rowing boat and a snorkel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="59"> The Beacon is packed with high-tech equipment, giant sand-blowers and metal detectors.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="60"> It has been searching the shallow Bahama Bank for the past five summers, raising Dollars 5m in treasure.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="61"> The annual operating costs of Dollars 200,000 come from Humphreys' own pocket.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="62"> When he is on board, he is the first diver out in the morning and the last one back at night.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="63"> Among his own discoveries was a 100.85-carat emerald, the largest ever discovered from a shipwreck.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="64"> That stimulated him still further and now he wants to explore deep-water wrecks.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="65"> To that end, Marex has just signed a profit-share deal with the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology which, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is in dire need of commercial funding.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="66"> The Russians have two MIRs - three-man submarines which can operate at depths of nearly 20,000 ft (6,000 metres) - and filmed the Titanic in the north Atlantic last year.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="67"> They intend to start operations in the autumn and their first targets are all in deep international waters: a 22,000-ton liner, believed to contain 50 boxes of gold, somewhere off Liberia; a World War Two submarine; and an ancient French wreck off Barbados thought to hold priceless Ming porcelain, a gift from the Chinese emperor to Louis XIV.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="68"> The MIRs will be working 18-hour dives at depths where the water is pitch black, pressure would make a man implode and the greatest danger to sanity comes not from claustrophobia but its opposite, agoraphobia, triggered by being surrounded by vast expanses of open sea.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="69"> There is plenty of potential to create a new industry, though.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="70"> During the war, 10,000 Allied ships were sunk by enemy action.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="71"> Their unrecovered cargoes include gold, silver, jewels, nickel, manganese, tin, copper and aluminium.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="72"> Long term, Marex has targeted 23 wrecks with cargo valued at Dollars 500m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="73"> Retrieval costs are estimated at Dollars 35m to Dollars 50m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="74"> But while diving on ships like the Maravillas can be seen as a hobby, albeit an expensive one, financing deep-water salvage is altogether different.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="75"> Although the technology has been available for years, it remains largely unproven.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="76"> Investors - who accept cheerfully that it costs Dollars 90m to repair a satellite in space, or are prepared to risk Dollars 50m financing a movie that might prove a flop - are wary.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="77"> Humphreys is confident of success.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="78"> But he admits: 'My true love is the old wrecks because they reek of history, romance and adventure.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="79"> My personal interest in this is much more than mere monetary gain.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="80"> Underwater treasure-hunting has been my life-long interest and one that I believe to be the last frontier on this planet'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="81"> He hopes to strike the jackpot with the Maravillas any time now.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="82"> 'Under the water, we have found some of the gold bars from the ship marked with the owners' names, and a trail of gold coins two miles long.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="83"> We believe that trail is leading us towards the mother lode.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="84"> This season, we will find the stern - and who knows what will be in it.'</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="7"> AT SPAIN'S north-western port of La Coruna, tankers have twice in the past 16 years been impaled on the harbour's outlying rocks.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="8"> But by the second time, when the tanker Aegean Sea ran aground just over a month ago, damage containment had demonstrably improved.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="9"> When the Urquiola created a spillage of some 100,000 tonnes in May 1976, La Coruna's fishing community heaved oil out of the sea in buckets.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="10"> When the Aegean Sea, with a cargo of 570,000 barrels of crude, broke up at the entrance of the port in thick fog on December 3, within hours 17 platforms were in position to start suctioning the oil.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="11"> The Urquiola spillage taught the authorities, for example, not to use detergents.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="12"> In 1976 they were used in La Coruna's estuary and all but killed off the local mollusc industry.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="13"> Some 15,000 kilos of clams used to be collected every day, but the total since has rarely exceeded 2,000 kilos.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="14"> With the Aegean Sea's spillage, booms were on standby in addition to the platforms and a series of container lorries equipped with suction apparatus that were stationed on the shore.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="15"> Booms, totalling 6km in all, were thrown across the entrance to the estuary and across those of its adjoining fjords.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="16"> The booms broke because of the heavy swell - La Coruna's coastline has barely 86 days a year of calm seas - but storms there last month helped to disperse the slick.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="17"> The Aegean Sea was carrying, like the Braer, light crude that evaporates more easily than heavy crude.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="18"> Unlike the Shetland Islands tragedy, a fire, which the authorities refrained from putting out, followed the shipwreck.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="19"> In all, between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of crude out of the Aegean Sea's 79,341-tonne load spilt out to sea.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="20"> Some 6,500 tonnes were pumped out directly from the stricken tanker and about 5,000 were suctioned from the platforms and the shore.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="21"> More than half the total load burnt itself out.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="22"> At the end of last week, with the pumping procedures virtually completed, work began to clean up the beaches.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="23"> Learning from the earlier disaster, the authorities have opted to do the cleaning manually as far as possible, with workers painstakingly scraping the crude-drenched sand with shovels rather than using earth-moving equipment, which risks burying the oil more deeply into the ground.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="24"> The rocks will also be scraped.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="25"> High-pressure hoses employed after the Urquiola spill were later found to have to have created unnecessary damage to micro-organisms.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="26"> The effects of the Aegean Sea disaster on the surrounding fishing grounds will take a long time to assess.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="27"> The slick has already broken up into tiny particles that are suspended on the surface but will eventually drop to the ocean floor, where they will stifle plants and crustaceans alike.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16401" num="28"> From the beginning of this month, the local fishing fleets were authorised to return to their traditional areas.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="6"> The Roaring Forties and the Storming Fifties.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="7"> Not exactly paradise for the sailor of a small boat.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="8"> The seas around 55 degrees south, off Cape Horn, are some of the worst in the world.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="9"> The swell rolls west to east almost unchecked.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="10"> It is hurricane-torn, even in summer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="11"> This month, four British yachtsmen plan to retrace one of the most arduous survival stories in maritime history: the voyage of Sir Ernest Shackleton and five others from the northernmost point of Antarctica across perilous seas to South Georgia, to fetch help for 22 colleagues marooned on barren Elephant Island - an attempt that succeeded and all survived.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="12"> The re-created voyage, in a specially designed 23ft replica boat named the Sir Ernest Shackleton, will benefit from the long days of the Antarctic summer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="13"> But it will not be plain sailing.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="14"> 'If we miss the island,' says the group's leader, Trevor Potts, a 43-year-old water sports development officer from Tyneside, 'there's no turning back: it's South Africa here we come]' But why should anyone want to retrace Shackleton's boat journey at all?</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="15"> 'It's been at the back of my mind for years,' Potts explains.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="16"> 'After all, it was one of the greatest survival stories ever.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="17"> To bring anyone back alive, let alone the entire party, against all the odds, was an amazing feat.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="18"> Shackleton was an unusual leader.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="19"> 'He undoubtedly made mistakes; yet he was the brains, behind not just both expeditions (six years earlier, Shackleton and three others came within 97 miles of the Pole), but the rescue as well'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="20"> Shackleton's ship, Endurance, sailed south in August 1914, just as war broke out.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="21"> His plan involved a crossing of the continent, from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea via the South Pole.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="22"> But in January 1915, Endurance became trapped in the pack ice.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="23"> She was borne 1,000 miles northwards before sinking, crushed by enormous pressures.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="24"> For four months the party camped on floes, then fled in lifeboats as the ice broke under them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="25"> That they reached Elephant Island, in appalling conditions, was a miracle.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="26"> The James Caird, largest of the three lifeboats, in which Shackleton made his dash for help, was 23ft long and 6ft in the beam.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="27"> On the ice two strakes had been added, giving her a freeboard of 2ft 2in.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="28"> Before the journey she was decked with packing case lids and covered with canvas, stretched over sledge runners.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="29"> A spare mast had been bolted to the keel to stiffen her.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="30"> Rocks and bags of gravel and rocks served as ballast.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="31"> The group's only reachable source of help, South Georgia, was a mere speck in the ocean, 800 miles distant.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="32"> Had it not been for a superb navigator, Frank Worsley, the Endurance's New Zealand-born skipper, James Caird might never have reached her destination.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="33"> What followed was an epic battle - against continuous, freezing gales and mountainous seas, drenched clothes, salt water sores, ice and frostbite - plus on day nine, at midnight: 'The huge crest of an enormous 90ft wave, the most gigantic I had ever seen,' wrote Shackleton.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="34"> 'It was a mighty upheaval of the ocean: we baled non-stop, like men fighting for dear life'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="35"> Their sleeping bags shredded; salt leaked into their fresh water.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="36"> Worsley had few glimpses of the sun to check their position; his navigational tables were soaked and almost illegible.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="37"> What saved them in the end was a mixture of luck, tenacity and hot food: concentrated 'hoosh', and scalding milk at four-hour intervals, boiled on a rickety primus.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="38"> When they sighted South Georgia 15 days later, they were faced by an iron-bound coast - a lee shore in a hurricane.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="39"> They were nearly dashed to pieces.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="40"> Disaster threatened when they almost lost their mast.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="41"> It was 36 hours before they made a safe landing, tacking precariously into a cove in King Haakon Sound.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="42"> A 500-ton steamer from Buenos Aires, they later learned, was lost that night with all hands.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="43"> Potts is no stranger to adventure.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="44"> His log of a single-handed voyage to Falmouth from the Azores, when his 25ft boat was almost overwhelmed, won the Dugon Prize in 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="45"> Soon after, he and another party member, Robert Egelstaff, made a journey by kayak, in near-zero temperatures, across the Bering Strait from Alaska.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="46"> On that trip, the party got separated by fog, missed an island and ended up being arrested by Russian coastguards.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="47"> When we met in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in Tyne and Wear, he had problems locating a nearby pub and mislaid the only female member of the party - Victoria Brown, a qualified yachtmaster and navigation specialist.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="48"> 'Don't worry,' Potts reassured me.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="49"> 'Vicky will be navigating, not me'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="50"> The Sir Ernest Shackleton has been built to his designs by McNulty's, the South Shields shipbuilder, where he was a workshop manager.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="51"> Is it really a replica?</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="52"> 'We kept her dimensions as near as we could to the James Caird,' says Potts.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="53"> She has a similar sailing ability.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="54"> But we've made her stronger and more watertight.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="55"> We've added four bulkheads.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="56"> Our hull, strip-planked, is glass fibre- and epoxy-sheathed, and laid on laminated frames; and has been strengthened with steel so she won't buckle.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="57"> Our cockpit is smaller but, like the James Caird, she's not high enough in the water to self-drain.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="58"> So we expect to do a fair bit of pumping and baling'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="59"> The new boat is ballasted not just with lead, but with water beneath the cabin bunks.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="60"> Perhaps most important, she has a tiller.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="61"> With his 'accursed mizzen' - as Worsley termed it - forming an obstruction, Shackleton was forced to steer with yoke and lines.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="62"> There is no room for a life-raft, but an Inmarsat satellite transceiver, backed up by VHF and GPS (global positioning system), should keep Potts's team on course and in touch.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="63"> 'Still, we plan to navigate by traditional means part of the time,' explains Vicky Brown, 'to get some idea of the problems Worsley faced'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="64"> If their GPS breaks down (as it might), they will have no choice.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="65"> Their main advantages over Shackleton will be temperature and daylight.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="66"> 'But winter conditions are actually more settled,' Trevor Potts points out.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="67"> 'In the Antarctic summer there's a good chance of strong crosswinds and high swells - a north-easterly right up our nose.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="68"> If we get a hurricane, things could definitely be as bad.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="69"> But Shackleton had huge problems with ice; we don't anticipate that'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="70"> No photographic record exists of the boat journey or the other epic that followed, and which the group also plans to retrace: a treacherous climb by Shackleton, Worsley and Irishman Tom Crean over the glaciers, snowbound ridges and bleak mountains of the uncharted interior of South Georgia to reach the Norwegian whaling stations on the other side.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="71"> The skills of the fourth expedition member, Chris Smith, a mountainering expert from North Wales, could well be needed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1403" num="72"> With a scrap of German chart and a pair of compasses, Shackleton's trio covered 40 miles (22 as the crow flies) in 36 hours, scarcely pausing to rest.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="6"> On an April night in 1991, an Italian car ferry, the Moby Prince, ran into an oil tanker outside the port of Livorno and 140 people died in the blaze.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="7"> It was Italy's worst maritime disaster since the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="8"> The crew of the tanker, the Agip Abruzzo, survived.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="9"> But the radio messages sent by Moby Prince went unheeded, both by other ships in the vicinity of Livorno - the accident occurred 2.5 miles out to sea - and on land.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="10"> One sailor escaped, but the passengers and the rest of the ferry crew died - the lifeboats had been burned and the sea was covered in blazing oil.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="11"> The Italian courts are still trying to decide what happened and who was responsible - many on shore and at sea were watching a televised football match.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="12"> The judges are faced by a seemingly inexplicable tangle of negligence and even possible sabotage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="13"> Evidence of explosives was found on the ferry, whose victims were not discovered until the following day.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="14"> Fortunately, tragedies like this are uncommon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="15"> But they do emphasise the need for the speedier introduction of advanced technologies and systems on shore and at sea not only to prevent loss of life, damage and pollution, but also to establish the cause of accidents.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="16"> Most accidents do not make headlines.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="17"> Another that did was the sinking of The Herald of Free Enterprise, a UK ferry, off the Belgian coast in 1987 with the loss of 193 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="18"> Oil-polluting incidents, such as the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska waters in 1989 or the sinking of the Braer off the Scottish coast a year ago, also gain worldwide attention.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="19"> Because not all incidents are reported, statistics may understate the level of casualties.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="20"> Last year, 246 people were killed or missing at sea and 213 ships lost, according to Lloyd's Register.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="21"> In 1991, lives lost were much higher at 1,204, with vessel losses at 258.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="22"> Since the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which the hold flooded rapidly when the cargo door was not shut, tougher international regulations are being introduced on internal strength and stability in case of damage for roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="23"> Because of their cavernous cargo capacity, ro-ros - especially older ones - can become dangerously unstable if not properly handled.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="24"> There is no evidence that the Moby Prince was defective.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="25"> But it is proving hard to find out what really happened.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="26"> Captain Profeta Brandimarte, a marine consultant involved in the investigations, says the response has been blank - 'no one saw, heard or did anything'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="27"> The investigation would be helped considerably if the ships had been fitted with a recording device, similar to an aircraft's black box.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="28"> The mystery of the Derbyshire, a bulk carrier which sank in a typhoon off Japan 13 years ago with the loss of 44 lives might also be capable of solution if the events leading up to its disappearance were available on tape; no trace of the ship was found.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="29"> Black boxes, or voyage event recorders - much bigger than those on aircraft and able to float free - are among the array of advanced technological equipment being introduced on worldwide fleets and on shore.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="30"> Others include electronic charts, one-man bridges, databases on the condition of ships (for use by port authorities) and vessel traffic systems in busy areas like the English Channel and Straits of Singapore.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="31"> Malek Pourzanjani, head of research at Southampton Institute's maritime division, is a firm advocate of VTS.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="32"> 'This is the way forward - local VTSs are emerging and being formed into regional and perhaps national and international centres'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="33"> Under forthcoming EU rules, vessels entering European waters will be required to radio their approach and route ahead of their arrival to make it easier for authorities to monitor their movements.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="34"> Since nearly all the world's cargoes go by sea, maritime safety is of concern to most governments.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="35"> The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a United Nations body based in London, is responsible for drawing up safety and pollution conventions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="36"> But it is the 147 member countries which are responsible for enforcing them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="37"> Some are more effective than others.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="38"> With more shipowners moving to cheaper foreign flags and crews, implementing conventions such as Solas on safety and Marpol on pollution has become harder.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="39"> Flag state control, in which governments control vessels flying their flag, does not always work.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="40"> Hence the increasing emphasis on port state control, in which the port authorities do the job.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="41"> Apart from the proliferation of flags and ship classification societies - there are around 50 of the latter - another problem is the increasing age of the world fleet.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="42"> The shipping industry has had a rough time as a result of over-capacity and the failure of freight rates to provide adequate returns.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="43"> This discourages new building and leads to vessels being kept in service for longer than desirable.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="44"> The average oil tanker is 16 years old and the average bulk carrier 13 years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="45"> 'The market doesn't pay the appropriate return for transportation,' says James Bell, permanent secretary at the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) representing 11 societies covering 90 per cent of world tonnage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="46"> But commercial and regulatory pressures on owners are increasing.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="47"> 'It makes good commercial sense to operate to the highest quality standards,' says Peter Thomas, a director of Britain's P&O Group, whose passenger and cargo fleet is being fitted with voyage recorders.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="48"> 'It affects corporate reputation and profitability'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="49"> Other western European fleets are also conscious of safety, both for its own sake and as a part of their image.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="50"> The recorders are being fitted by Nedlloyd, the Dutch company, on its North Sea Ferries venture with P&O.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="51"> Developed by P&O's subsidiary Three Quays International and its Broadgate electronics unit, they provide a 24-hour record of radar, position, engine and other data, including conversations on the ship's bridge.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="52"> 'This gives investigators access to the quality evidence that aircraft have,' says Bruce Standring, Three Quays' managing director.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="53"> He hopes they will be made mandatory under IMO's safety convention.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="54"> Also under discussion within IMO is the issue of whether to build up a comprehensive database on the quality of individual vessels for use by ports.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="55"> This would be along the lines of the one developed by the US Coastguard.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="56"> Electronic charts, which are presented on screen and use positioning data from satellites and information from ships' own sensors, are another innovation which owners and seafarers are gradually coming to accept, though international standards are still being worked out.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="57"> 'Until about a year-and-a-half ago, nine out of 10 mariners would have said 'why do we need this'?</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="58"> It was the typical marine attitude - very conservative and anti-technology,' says Helmut Lanziner, president of Vancouver-based Offshore Systems.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="59"> Now, he adds, it is a Dollars 1bn a year business.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="60"> Instead of having to update charts by hand, with the delays this causes, the task can be done digitally at extreme speed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="61"> This is especially important in confined areas such as harbours and channels where most accidents occur.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="62"> It also means ships need fewer people on the bridge to collect and monitor information.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="63"> Hapag-Lloyd of Germany is one company which has adopted the one-man bridge on its container ships.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="64"> One specially trained person can run the ship, surrounded in a cockpit-type enclosure by all the necessary instruments and indicators.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="65"> Yet although the trend is clear, not all shipowners look to the technological horizon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="66"> 'A casual look round the bridge of a ship shows technology embraced in a piecemeal fashion,' Admiral Sir Julian Oswald told a recent conference organised by the Southampton Institute.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="67"> 'Big heavy levers mingle with microprocessors.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="68"> It's an environment fit for the ergonomist's black museum'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="69"> Unfortunately, all too many ships on the world's oceans today still meet this description.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="10"> Lamb won't name the city but will say that he went there to see what has become the talk of the coin community: the horde of gold coins and bullion pulled from the wreck of the SS Central America before the hurricane struck.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="14"> For Lamb, that's quite a statement.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="15"> Among the numismatic experts who have reviewed the list of coins and gold bars taken from the wreck, 200 miles off Charleston, there is widespread agreement that the find is certain to make investors in the Columbus American Discovery Group wealthy indeed.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="16"> The gold, unloaded recently from a salvage ship in Norfolk, Va., has been valued at $28 million to $450 million.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="19"> None of the hundreds of U.S. gold coins recovered, thus far, from the 132-year-old wreck have knocked the coin community on its ear.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="20"> The most impressive find has been the pioneer gold coins and bars, which were produced by assay offices in California and were being shipped East when the Central America sank in a hurricane in 1857.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="6"> The catastrophic failure of lifeboats and life rafts to save passengers in last week's Baltic ferry disaster is set to bring demands for a review of emergency procedures on passenger vessels as well as the review promised by the International Maritime Organisation of the design of roll-on, roll-off ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="7"> One of the most distressing sights from the rescue operation of the Estonia, which capsized and sank with the loss of more than 900 lives, was of dozens of life rafts discovered either empty, or in many cases swamped by icy water and containing the bodies of people who drowned or died of exposure despite managing to clamber aboard the rubber boats.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="8"> Only a handful of the Estonia's large lifeboats were even launched.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="9"> 'I can agree that the equipment was not doing its job since so many died, but it is up to the rule makers and designers to look into this,' Mr Sten Forsberg, technical director of Nordstrom and Thulin, the Swedish co-operator of the Estonia, said at the weekend.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="10"> 'I am quite sure that the aftermath of this tremendous tragedy will result in stricter regulations for life-saving equipment'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="11"> The chilling evidence from the Estonia suggests that in a case where a ship lists suddenly and heavily, the ordered evacuation of passengers in lifeboats and life rafts can quickly become virtually impossible - especially in storm conditions and with panic surging through a stricken ship.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="12"> A spokeswoman for the Viking Line, a Finnish-based operator in the Baltic which used to run the Estonia, said that in the best conditions preparing and launching lifeboats took 15 to 20 minutes, 'but in conditions like those faced by the Estonia, the system can quickly break down'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="13"> Ship operators say lifeboats cannot be launched if a ship is listing more than 15 degrees.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="14"> But in heavy seas, a lesser list may make launching impossible.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="15"> As lifeboats and many life rafts are designed to be loaded with passengers before being lowered into the water, this means that even in conditions much less severe than those faced by the Estonia, evacuating passengers by lifeboat fails.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="16"> The Estonia carried rubber life rafts packed in plastic containers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="17"> The rafts were designed to pop up to the surface and self-inflate once submerged below a depth of four metres - which they did.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="18"> But most, clearly, were easily swamped by the high seas, as water washed in through the door in their weatherproof covers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="19"> One survivor said the raft he clambered on to was upside down.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="20"> The Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri on Saturday quoted Mr Jens Peter Bie, an executive at the Danish company Viking Life-Saving Equipment, which supplied life rafts to the Estonia, as saying the rafts on the ship were 14 years old.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="21"> He said newer, self-inflating and self-righting rafts were available, but ship owners were deterred from buying them by costs 30-40 per cent greater than standard rafts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="22"> Mr Harri Kulovara, operations chief for the Finnish-run Silja Line, said: 'I believe the rubber life rafts can be more effective than the traditional lifeboats - they are much easier to launch and use.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="23"> But they must be launched properly'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="24"> Questions have also been raised since the Estonia disaster about the way ferry operators brief passengers on emergency procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="25"> The requirement under IMO regulations falls well short of the obligatory safety demonstrations made on airlines.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="26"> No lifeboat drill is required on the 12-14 hour overnight sailings that are the common duration on the Baltic routes and none is offered by the operators.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="27"> Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope with emergencies.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="28"> They make public announcements to stress to passengers the importance of reading the emergency procedure notices and run videos on passenger TV services.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18722" num="29"> However, as the Estonia catastrophe showed, even the best prepared crews and passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="7"> The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for shipping, yesterday ordered a top-level inquiry into the safety of vehicle ferries following the loss of more than 900 lives in the Estonia disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="8"> The inquiry was announced as Sweden's National Maritime Board said the Estonia may have sunk because its outer bow door was ripped off in a storm, allowing water to pour on to the ship's cavernous vehicle deck.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="9"> It also emerged that the Europa, one of the ships that picked up survivors of the Estonia tragedy, suffered serious damage to its bow door in the heavy seas that lashed the rescue fleet.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="10"> As concern about the operation of roll-on roll-off ships grew, Mr William O'Neil, the IMO secretary-general, ordered a full safety review by the organisation's maritime safety committee.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="11"> IMO officials said the committee would consider all aspects of roll-on roll-off shipping at its next meeting in December at the org-anisation's London headquarters.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="12"> No agenda has yet been drawn up, but the committee is thought certain to consider whether bulkheads on the ships' open vehicle decks would help to increase stability in the event of a surge of water through the doors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="13"> Most ship owners believe bulkheads would reduce the profitability of roll-on roll-off ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="14"> But an IMO official said the review's 'prime consideration' would be safety.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="15"> 'The travelling public are entitled to know that economic considerations come second,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="16"> The committee has the power to amend the 1981 international convention on the safety of life at sea, which provides the framework for national shipping legislation in 122 countries covering 97 per cent of world tonnage.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="17"> However, the committee is expected to produce a full report on the implications of the Estonia disaster before deciding whether to call a special meeting to consider changes to the convention.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="18"> Mr Bengt-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's head of maritime safety, said the joint Estonian-Finnish-Swedish team investigating the disaster had been told by witnesses that the visor-style outer bow door was missing when the ship sank.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="19"> 'The outer door was lost,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="20"> Witnesses saw 30-35cm of water on the car deck, enough to destabilise the vessel, he added.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="21"> Inspectors carrying out urgent checks of all roll-on roll-off ferries calling at Swedish ports said the port bow door on the Europa, a 3,000-passenger ferry operated by the Silja Line, suffered damaged hinges during the storm and could not be opened.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="22"> The Europa, the biggest ferry of its kind sailing in the Baltic, was allowed to sail for Finland last night after the Finnish-based Silja Line said it would only load the ship by its aft doors until repairs had been carried out.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="23"> A Finnish search boat last night located the wreck of the Estonia, at a depth of 250-280 ft, 25 miles south-west of the Finnish island of Uto.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="24"> The investigating team plans to survey the ship with remote-controlled cameras for evidence of what caused it to sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="25"> Swedish inspectors plan to scrutinise over the next week all 50 passenger-carrying roll-on roll-off ferries currently calling at Swedish ports.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="7"> The sinking of the Estonia, a ship 50 per cent-owned by the Estonian state and largely crewed by Estonians, has been a severe blow to this country of 1.6m people in only its fourth year of independence.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="8"> The disaster has directly affected a larger proportion of the nation than is the case for Sweden, where most of the victims lived, or Finland, which played an important role in the rescue operation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="9"> Estonians also feel that it has thrown into question the competence and efficiency of their country's shipping industry - and its ability to break free from the inheritance of its past in the Soviet Union, where transport was expected to be hazardous.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="10"> A large white cross has been placed on a grassy knoll near Tallinn's Maritime Museum, with candles burning on both sides.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="11"> Memorial services will be held throughout Estonia tomorrow.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="12"> Ms Riina Taglis, a shop manager who had come to pay her respects at the cross, said yesterday: 'For us it is like a horror, like a time after the war when so many people were killed'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="13"> This parallel was also used by Mr Mart Laar, the outgoing prime minister, in comments he made in Finland on Thursday: he recalled the number of people who drowned in 1944, escaping to Sweden in small boats when the Red Army came back to Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="14"> The government has set up a fund to assist the families in distress.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="15"> The Estonian Cultural Foundation has also launched an appeal to build a monument to the memory of the victims.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="16"> And the weekly Eesti Express has already collected over 560,000 kroons (Pounds 28,000) for its appeal on behalf of the victims' families.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="17"> In an interview yesterday with the FT, Mr Laar emphasised that early evidence showed the sinking of the ship was not the fault of Estonian crew or procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="18"> 'We got information on Thursday night that, in the past 10 years, six other serious accidents had happened to ships of this type of construction.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="19"> There were no disasters because these accidents happened in calm weather conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="20"> But in a Baltic storm the disaster happened.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="21"> 'What seems to have taken place, from the reports I have had, is that the front part of the ship seemed to fall away and the water flooded in.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="22"> That could not be crew failure and the inspection in Tallinn before the ferry failed showed no problems.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="23"> Some people talk of a loud noise, as of a collision'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="24"> This possibility has also been raised by the testimony of one of the first Estonian survivors to come back to Tallinn, Mr Ain-Alar Johanson.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="25"> On Thursday night, he said he had heard a 'loud, metallic noise' a little before the ship begun to sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="26"> Mr Indrek Tarand, top civil servant in the Estonian foreign ministry, said: 'Even though a ship called Estonia was wrecked and went to the bottom, it doesn't mean that Estonia collapses - though this is a catastrophe that will be remembered for centuries'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="27"> Mr Ivar Raig, a member of parliament for the Rural Centre party, said: 'In the short term, people will be worried about us - we may again be seen as a country of disasters.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="28"> 'But on the other hand it can show how far we are part of another world.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="29"> This was a ship built in Germany with mixed Swedish-Estonian ownership and the rescue operations were carried out by Swedes, Finns and Estonians.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18877" num="30"> It is a common tragedy for all of these.'</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="7"> Finland's board of navigation said yesterday that the bow doors of all roll-on, roll-off ferries sailing in 'open' Baltic seas had to be welded shut as a safety precaution while investigations into the sinking of the Estonia continued.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="8"> Swedish authorities say they will insist on similar measures, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="9"> Silja Line, the Baltic's leading ferry operator, said it would seal the bow doors of five ferries - vessels which either sail in open seas or have the same visor-type bow construction as the Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="10"> Three other Baltic ferry operators have promised similar measures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="11"> Accident investigators want to locate the Estonia's bow door, after video footage established on Monday that it had been torn off in heavy seas.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17958" num="12"> Mr Andi Meister, Estonian chairman of the commission, said: 'We now know how it happened when water gushed into the ship, but we still do not know what caused the catastrophe'.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="6"> For a company that was in crisis and making heavy losses only three years ago, Stena Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, has staged a remarkable comeback.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="7"> Despite difficult market conditions in both its Scandinavian and UK markets, it is heading for a record SKr500m profit in 1994 and it is once again planning significant fleet investments.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="8"> The severe difficulties experienced earlier in the decade were caused by the company's Dollars 570m purchase of Sealink, Britain's second-biggest ferry operator, in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="9"> The move left it with huge debt-servicing costs and a need to undertake important restructuring in the newly-acquired operation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="10"> The Gothenburg-based company even threatened to close Sealink entirely, barely 18 months after the purchase in a move to force unions to accept drastic cost-cutting.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="11"> If Stena ever shared the widespread view that it had overreached itself, these days it has no such doubts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="12"> Mr Bo Lerenius, Stena Line president, says: 'It was a bold move, but strategically it was definitely the right one'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="13"> What has changed is not just the outlook for Stena Sealink, but the broader financial recovery which the whole group has staged over the past three years.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="14"> It got out of its crisis by hacking back costs, launching a hefty rights issue and convertible loan, and reigning in investments.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="15"> Together with rising profits and increasing cash flow, the group has been able to pay a substantial part of its debt.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="16"> It is now confident of getting its equity-to-assets ratio back to the pre-Sealink purchase level of 30 per cent by early next year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="17"> Stena today carries more than 14m passengers a year on 15 routes in 32 vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="18"> The irony is that the UK routes have ended up supporting the group at a time when its Scandinavian business has suffered from recession and the weak Swedish krona.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="19"> Passenger numbers on UK routes climbed 10 per cent in the first eight months of this year, while Scandinavian routes saw a 1.4 per cent decrease.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="20"> Conditions in both markets have been difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="21"> In the UK there has been a price war in the run-up to the full start-up of the Channel Tunnel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="22"> In Scandinavia, consumer spending has fallen and there has been a sharp fall in travel on some routes in the wake of the Estonia tragedy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="23"> Given that Stena has some 34 per cent of the British passenger shipping market - second only to P&O - it cannot afford to be complacent about the Channel Tunnel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="24"> Its main UK route, Dover-Calais, will be competing head-on with tunnel traffic.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="25"> Stena is sceptical about Eurotunnel's assumptions that it will eventually gain some 30 per cent of freight traffic and 50 per cent of cars on short-sea cross-channel routes, but it is basing its strategy on them nevertheless.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="26"> One solution would be for it to seek an extensive collaboration with P&O, although this would have to meet with the approval of the relevant competition authorities.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="27"> In any case, it expects the overall market to grow, helped by economic growth in both Britain and France.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="28"> Nordic ferry traffic has been hit hard by the sinking of the ferry Estonia, which capsized in heavy seas in September with the loss of more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="29"> Stena has suffered less than other shipping groups, partly because it does not operate in the Baltic Sea where the tragedy occurred.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="30"> The company's passenger volumes in the Swedish and Norwegian markets fell by 12-14 per cent during October and November, although there are now signs of recovery.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="31"> Stena, like other ferry operators, is bracing itself for some tough new safety regulations in the wake of the tragedy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="32"> Although these will add to costs, it believes the impact will be neutral in competitive terms because rivals will have to implement the same measures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="33"> The secret weapon in Stena's armoury is undoubtedly its revolutionary HSS Highspeed Sea Service project, which it has developed with its main owner, Stena AB.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="34"> Three fast ferries, which will halve normal travel times, have been ordered from a Finnish yard and a fourth is planned.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="35"> 'We are quite convinced that this will change ferry traffic a great deal,' says Mr Lerenius.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="36"> However, some observers regard the project as technically risky, and at a total estimated cost of SKr3bn, it is certainly an ambitious investment.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="37"> It is the first time that high-speed ferries will be able to carry lorries, trailers and buses alongside passengers and cars.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="38"> The boast is that they will offer a degree of comfort and reliability which present fast vessels, such as catamarans, can not.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="39"> The first of the Finnish-built vessels, which will each be able to carry 1,500 passengers, is due to enter service across the Irish Sea next September.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="40"> A lot is riding on the success of the ships, not least because they are an element in the group's overall strategy of enhancing the transport-derived portion of its revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="41"> The aim is to gradually reduce the company's dependence on duty-free sales which are due to be phased out under European Union rules in 1999.</s>

<s docid="FT944-1600" num="42"> Already Stena has reduced the proportion of on-board income (including duty-free) as a percentage of total operating income from 55 per cent in 1988 to less than 35 per cent today.</s>
