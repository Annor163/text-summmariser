<s docid="FT921-9644" num="7"> CUBA'S SUGAR crop is at best likely to be 6.5m tonnes in 1991-92, about 1.1m tonnes less than in 1990-91, according to a group of sugar experts who gathered together in the Dominican republic under the auspices of the (moderate) Cuban exile group, Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="8"> The experts - who included a senior official from the US Department of Agriculture, analysts from FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency, Scudder Group, Czarnikow, the London trade house, and assorted academics - believed that Cuba failed to harvest any sugar in the last two months of 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="9"> This would reduce the seasonal (November-June) harvest by between 300,000 and 1m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="10"> In January harvesting appears to have been very slow.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="11"> Even if the weather holds up, the experts agreed that Cuba would be lucky to produce 6.5m tonnes this year, given the shortages of spare parts, poor maintenance of equipment, and problems in the field.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="12"> The onset of rain would push the forecast even lower, said Mr Gerry Hagelberg, of FO Licht.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="13"> In November the USDA estimated that Cuba's production would reach 7.3m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="14"> Mr Peter Buzzanell, the official responsible for estimates, suggested that the department would formally revise its estimate downwards as early as this week.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="15"> The drop of production, if it materialises, will hit Cuba's battered economy hard - for the first time it is having to sell sugar (usually 75 per cent of exports) at world, rather than preferential prices.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="16"> But it will come as welcome news to the world sugar market, which has been bracing itself for a flood of sugar after the collapse of Cuba's barter trade with the former-Soviet Union.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="17"> In the nine months to last September, Cuba exported 6.15m tonnes of sugar, of which 3.7m tonnes went to the Soviet Union, 740,000 tonnes to China, about 500,000 tonnes to Japan and Canada and the remainder to assorted countries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="18"> In the full year Cuba promised to send the Soviet Union 4m tonnes of sugar in return for 10m tonnes of oil and other products.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="19"> (An exchange that valued Cuban sugar at about 24 cents a lb, compared with a world price of 8 cents a lb).</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="20"> This year, however, Cuba has had to renegotiate with ex-Soviet Union states.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="21"> So far Russia has agreed to buy (with oil) 500,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar, with an option to buy another 500,000 tonnes; Kazakhstan will take another 200,000 tonnes, with an option for 200,000 tonnes; and Latvia 50,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="22"> Cuba will thus have to find a home for about 1.5m tonnes of sugar that in the past went to the Soviet Union, assuming production at the lower 6.5m tonnes (and exports at around 5.4m tonnes), and the options fully taken up.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="23"> Some of this excess sugar will go to other ex-Soviet states that have yet to sign trade agreements with Cuba, and, says Mr Hagelberg, perhaps as much as 400,000 tonnes to Iran and South Korea.</s>

<s docid="FT921-9644" num="24"> Nevertheless the world markets could still be expected to absorb about 1m tonnes of extra Cuban sugar this year - unless Cuba's crop deteriorates still further.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="6"> Cuba's sugar harvest, mainstay of the island's economy, could soon begin to level out after its recent nosedive, but a return to cruising altitude looks a long way off.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="7"> Just five years ago output was running at a comfortable 8m tonnes a year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="8"> But then it went into a tailspin.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="9"> The crop fell to a historic low of 4m tonnes in 1993-94 from 4.2m tonnes in 1992-93 and 7m tonnes the previous year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="10"> This represented lost export earnings over two harvests of Dollars 1bn, a heavy blow for a sugar-dominated, recession-hit economy whose total export revenue in 1993 was an estimated Dollars 1.7 bn.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="11"> Faced with continuing severe input shortages and a reduced level of harvestable cane, the best Cuba can hope for from the 1994-95 season is to slow the decline in its leading export industry.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="12"> If it can do this, the island may be able to lay some foundations for a future recovery.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="13"> But it will be a hard slog.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="14"> Sugar market analysts, such as London trade house ED & F.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="15"> Man, have already predicted that Cuban output will continue to fall in 1994-95.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="16"> Even the Cuban authorities, normally loath to make any public pre-harvest forecasts, are signalling that they expect a crop as low as or lower than last year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="17"> 'This is not a time for spectacular results measured in large volumes of sugar,' the official workers' daily Trabajadores said in an October 10 editorial.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="18"> 'Sugar production suffers from a syndrome of cycles, either good or bad.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="19">. . if you had a bad previous harvest, recovery is difficult,' said Mr Juan Triana Cordovi, deputy director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on the Cuban Economy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="20"> It was the sudden collapse after 1990 of crucial Soviet supplies of fuel, fertiliser, herbicides and spares that knocked Cuban sugar production off course.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="21"> Recent harvests have also been buffeted by unseasonal bad weather and slowed by declining efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="22"> The antidote proposed by Mr Nelson Torres, Cuba's minister for sugar, is a short, sharp and above all efficient 1994-95 harvest.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="23"> This year's campaign, if it starts this month as usual, will not be allowed to extend beyond April.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="24"> In another change of strategy, all of Cuba's more than 150 mills will be required to join the harvest to maximise production.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="25"> Last season, more than a dozen below-par mills did not operate, with the result that their machinery was 'cannibalised' for other uses and their work forces dispersed.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="26"> The over-extended 1993-94 harvest, which lasted well beyond May, cut into growing cane reserves and delayed field cultivation and mill repairs.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="27"> Mill managers, struggling to meet pre-set production targets and to compensate for industrial breakdowns and inefficiency, harvested cane that could have been left for the coming season.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="28"> Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, said in a September 2 article: 'There is going to be once again - it's no secret - a serious shortage of cane'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="29"> That echoed an August, ED & F.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="30"> Man report warning that the protracted 1993-94 campaign, continuing input shortages and reports of delays in the planting programme meant that 'further degradation of (Cuba's) sugar production cannot be eliminated'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="31"> As the start of the harvest approaches, sugar workers have been the target of a blitz of official criticism.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="32"> State media have accused them of ducking out of eight-hour work schedules, using poor quality seed and failing to weed growing cane.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="33"> 'Why is the cane in such poor state.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="34"> . . so full of weeds'? state-run Radio Rebelde asked back in September.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="35"> Especially targetted for criticism were the cane growing co-operatives, the so-called basic units of co-operative production (UBPCs), created in September, 1993 as part of a decentralising reform of Cuba's state-run farming system.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="36"> 'Why have these UBPCs still not been able to contain and reverse the sharp collapse of the nation's greatest resource'?</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="37"> Mr Trabajadores said six weeks ago.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="38"> Reasons cited for poor productivity in the cane co-operatives were the lack of incentives, delays in obtaining promised benefits like new housing and even shortages of work clothes like boots.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="39"> Government officials were studying the possibility of introducing greater material incentives for sugar workers - whether in local or hard currency or in access to consumer goods - like those already available for workers in Cuba's tourist industry.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="40"> To offset harvest manpower shortages, Cuba's official trade union organisation, the CTC, is preparing to mobilise 61,000 cane cutters across the island, 25,000 more than last year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="41"> This manual cutting force will also help to compensate for cutbacks in machine harvesting resulting from shortages of fuel, lubricants and spare parts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="42"> On the commercial front, Cuba has maintained a hermetic silence over the state of its strategic sugar trade contracts with Russia and China.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="43"> Traders in London and New York reported as early as June that the country might have problems meeting all of its export commitments because of the second consecutive low harvest.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="44"> The Cubans were expected to have sought to roll over many of their commitments into the next crop period, a tactic widely used even when the island was producing harvests of about 8m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11926" num="45"> The roll-over mechanism is considerably less drastic than the force majeure declared by Cuba in June, 1993, when torrential rains devastated an already flagging harvest .</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="7"> Russia has suspended shipments of oil to Cuba because the Caribbean state has not met its promised level of sugar exports to Russia, Mr Oleg Davydov, the Russian trade minister, said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="8"> The cut in supplies to a country which once enjoyed the closest links with the former Soviet Union is expected to further damage the recession-hit Cuban economy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="9"> The decision is in line with Russia's attitude to other countries which once enjoyed oil imports for barter, or at prices far below the world market level - including former Soviet states which are now independent countries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="10"> Mr Davydov said Russia had exported 1.5m tonnes of oil to Cuba, but had received only 500,000 tonnes of sugar - 550,000 tonnes short of the amount agreed.</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="11"> He said Russia would sell the remaining 1m tonnes of oil it had agreed to ship to Cuba on the world market, 'adding around Dollars 120m to the national budget'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-12369" num="12"> 'If after our own sugar harvest the need arises to import more sugar cane, then we are prepared to open negotiations again with Cuba on this issue in 1995,' Mr Davydov said.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="6"> THE COLLAPSE of Barbados' sugar industry late last month is the latest indication of the sometimes terminal difficulties which beset Caribbean producers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="7"> The region is faced with high production costs and often low productivity, and is unable to survive without guaranteed access to markets such as the European Community and the US, and which pay higher than prevailing world market prices.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="8"> The problems caused by inefficiency and indebtedness are exacerbated by what many producers see as a threat to current preferential market arrangements.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="9"> Many are worried by the recent reduction in US import quotas, and are uncertain how they will fare if the North American Free Trade Agreement is implemented and Mexican production becomes a market factor.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="10"> In the case of Barbados, the island has been unable to produce enough even to meet its quota obligations to these guaranteed markets.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="11"> Efforts are under way to jump-start the industry after the state-owned Barbados National Bank, exercising tighter credit control as part of a government austerity programme, and which is owed Dollars 50m by the industry, suspended all further loans.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="12"> This followed production of 55,000 tonnes from the 1992 harvest, the lowest in 60 years, according to official figures.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="13"> In order to make use of its opportunities on the EC and US markets the island has had to import sugar to meet domestic demand.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="14"> Ironically, the collapse of the industry came after indications that it was being put under new management by Booker Tate, a subsidiary of Booker, the UK food and farming group.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="15"> The company has become an important factor in the region's troubled sugar industry, and has been called in to help the industries in Guyana, Belize and St Kitts-Nevis, and to run two of Jamaica's nine mills.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="16"> Trinidad and Tobago is the only producer in the Commonwealth Caribbean in which Booker Tate is not involved.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="17"> In all cases the company contracted to give corporate management and technical services to sugar industries in the five countries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="18"> It provides engineers, technologists, agriculturalists, economists, marketing specialists and support staff.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="19"> The industries in both Guyana and Jamaica have attracted financial assistance from multilateral institutions as a result of the management contracts given to Booker Tate, But assessments to the company's effectiveness differ in the two countries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="20"> Jamaican officials say the performance of the two mills managed by the company since 1985 has been 'disappointing'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="21"> Yet the case of Guyana shows that the regional sugar industry is not beyond redemption.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="22"> From output of 330,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s, Guyana's production, plagued by labour unrest and poor weather, slumped to 135,000 tonnes in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="23"> The industry declared shortfalls on its European Community quota for three years, and shipped none of its quota to the US.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="24"> Booker Tate's takeover of the management of the industry has been followed, however, by a decisive turnaround.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="25"> Production is up this year and export quotas have been met.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="26"> In the Dominican Republic, the region's second largest producer after Cuba, the problems of financial viability have been compounded by a shortage of labour.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="27"> Foreign criticism of the treatment of workers from neighbouring Haiti, and the subsequent expulsion of thousands of Haitian workers, has resulted in the state-owned producer suffering a painful drop in output.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="28"> Production this year is 8 per cent less than the 326,000 tonnes of last year and sugar has had to be imported to meet domestic demand.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="29"> The outlook for the industry, like that of others in the region, has been depressed by the recent reduction in global imports by the US.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="30"> The Caribbean's cumulative quota has been reduced by 11 per cent to 276,341 tonnes, causing an estimated Dollars 15m reduction in earnings.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5210" num="31"> It is the second consecutive cut for the Caribbean holders of US quotas, which were allowed to supply 471,710 tonnes in 1991.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="12"> Cheered by the collapse of communism in East Europe, Cuban exiles have been dancing in the streets of Miami in expectation of Fidel Castro's imminent downfall.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="13"> One militant anti-Castro group, Alpha-66, has even begun paramilitary training in the Everglades to join battle instantly if there is an armed uprising.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="14"> But Cubans in the streets of Havana, and experts here from both East and West, say that despite international pressures and increased domestic grumbling over the Communist country's severe economic problems, the hemisphere's most durable dictator may stay in power for years.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="15"> "His relationship with the Soviet Union is the key," a Western diplomat said, noting that the Soviets' annual $5.5-billion package of aid and credits has been the Havana government's lifeline for the past three decades.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="16"> "If that goes on, he goes on".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="17"> A top Soviet diplomat, who is privately critical of the Castro regime but believes it is in no danger of collapse, said: "I don't think it is possible that we will cut our aid to Cuba.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="21"> Not one expert interviewed recently in the course of a two-week visit to Havana saw any sign of a significant weakening in Soviet-Cuban ties.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="22"> This despite a newly abrasive tone in the relationship, including stingingly critical articles and ominous grumblings about continued aid to Cuba in the Moscow press.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="23"> Nor have they detected the kind of restiveness in the military and among the people that would suggest that the regime is losing its grip.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="24"> Among the specialists who talked with a reporter on the condition of anonymity were diplomats from East and West Europe, Latin and North America, and the Soviet Union.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="25"> None foresaw a Caribbean copy of East Europe's experience, but all agreed that even with continued Soviet aid, Cuba faces hard times that will keep the country on a tough austerity diet for as long as the U.S. embargo lasts.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="26"> The main problems today, they said, are a shortage of hard currency, brought on by the country's almost total reliance on trade in nonconvertible rubles and barter with the Soviets and the former East Bloc countries, and sluggishness and mismanagement in Cuba's centrally controlled economy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="27"> Castro and other government officials have been candid about the grim prospects, which they said will become acute in 1991, when trade agreements expire and Cuba must begin paying hard currency for spare parts and other vital goods from its suppliers in East Europe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="28"> "We don't deny that when our economic ties with Eastern Europe are torn down we are going to face some problems," said Jorge Gomez Barata, a top Castro adviser in the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="29"> "But we will be able to continue without disorder".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="30"> While barter and ruble-based trade with the Soviets is expected to continue, Castro and the government-run press have warned frequently of the need for belt-tightening.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="31"> Gomez Barata and other senior officials emphasize that they have reordered government priorities to emphasize greater self-sufficiency in industry and agriculture and a crash program to develop tourism and other hard-currency earners.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="32"> On the streets of Havana, there is ample evidence that hard times already are here.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="33"> Long lines form quickly at food markets when sparse supplies of imported pork, beef and chicken arrive from hard-currency countries such as Brazil.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="34"> A running joke heard in food lines at several Havana markets has it that "if there's another revolution it won't be over ideology, it'll be over a chicken breast".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="35"> As they queue for food, people complain openly about recent increases in the price of bread and eggs, both in short supply since December when the Soviets delayed a bonus shipment of wheat and feed grains and the Cuban larder ran dry.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="36"> A Soviet Embassy official said wheat had routinely been sent a month or more in advance of its committed due date, so that Cuba, in effect, received a bonus of an extra month's wheat supply after each year's commitment was fulfilled.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="37"> The expectation was that Cuba would stockpile the bonus grain against a rainy day.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="38"> The rainy day came in December, when, facing problems at home and with their formal 1989 commitment fulfilled, the Soviets withheld the advance shipment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="39"> "We've been telling them all along they should have prepared for it," a Soviet economic specialist complained.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="40"> "It is impossible to live without at least a minimum stockpile.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="41"> It's all very frustrating".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="42"> Cuban economist Eugenio Balari, who directs the government's think tank on domestic consumption, acknowledged: "There was a certain amount of guilt on our side.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="43"> We should have stockpiled so we had a cushion.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="44"> As it was, we practically had to unload the wheat from the boats and truck it directly to the bakers when it came.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="45"> Now we've increased the price of bread and eggs, not for the money but for conservation, so we will have a cushion.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="46"> Once we have a stockpile, maybe we will lower the prices again".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="47"> Although one hears grumbling in the food lines, none of the foreign experts here believe that the public's unhappiness even borders on the kind of discontent that has been responsible for bread riots and rebellion in many other Third World countries.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="48"> "The average Cuban may be eating a bland diet, but even with shortages, he is better fed than most other Latin Americans," a Scandinavian diplomat said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="49"> Another bonus feature of Soviet-Cuban trade has been a liberal flow of subsidized Soviet oil, about 20% to 25% more than enough to meet Cuba's domestic needs.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="50"> Until now, the Castro government has routinely sold the surplus oil for desperately needed hard currency.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="51"> As recently as 1985, the last year Cuba reported its oil trade figures, the re-export of Soviet oil earned Havana a tidy $621 million.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="52"> Since then, re-export earnings have gone unreported, leading some specialists to conclude that the bonus oil flow has slowed or even ended.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="53"> But a Soviet diplomat, without revealing figures, said the oil flow continues in excess of Cuba's needs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="54"> "The Russians may cut back somewhat, but it's not in their interest to cut Cuba down to starvation rations," another diplomat said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="55"> The Soviet economic specialist agreed, saying: "There's no question that we need these products.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="56"> In the U.S.S.R., we produce about 8 to 9 million tons of sugar a year and have to buy 4 million tons from Cuba to make up the shortfall.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="57"> The significance to us of the Cuban sugar is considerable.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="58"> Nickel is vital for our industry.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="59"> And Cuba's citrus fruits are very important to us".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="60"> But he hinted at harder bargaining by a Soviet delegation now in Havana to begin negotiating new trade terms to replace the five-year cooperation agreement that expires at the end of this year.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="61"> Because of the use of barter and overvalued rubles and Cuban pesos, it is hard to calculate the extent of the Soviet subsidy to the Castro regime.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="62"> But experts say the Soviets pay more than twice the world price for Cuban sugar and similarly unrealistic prices for raw materials and citrus fruits.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="63"> Thus Cuba may soon be getting less nourishment from the Soviets than it has in the past, but the experts doubt that any future cutback will be sharp enough to endanger the Castro government.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="64"> Even if Soviet aid dropped to only $3 billion a year, it would suffice to keep Castro's troubled economic machine running, predicted Prof.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="65"> Philip Brenner, a Cuba specialist at American University in Washington.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="66"> Like many diplomatic specialists here, Brenner predicted that Soviet aid will continue and that Castro might survive as Cuba's leader for another decade.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="67"> "Cuba is essential to the Soviet Union's image as a superpower," Brenner said.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="68"> "While it is costly, there are certain benefits, both military and civil".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="69"> He cited in particular Moscow's largest electronic eavesdropping network outside the Soviet Union and the continued use of Cuban bases for aerial surveillance and naval support.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="70"> Most of the experts here believe that Cuba's military importance to the Soviets has waned, except, as one said, "as the last nice tropical outpost for KGB and army officers to do temporary duty".</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="71"> But they said Cuba's military importance is not the chief element of the strategic equation in Moscow.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="72"> "It's not the strategic military value but the broader geopolitical value that counts," one said.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="73"> "This is one of the Soviets' last claims to being a great power.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="74"> With East Germany gone, Cuba is their most important ally".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="75"> As a result, he said, Moscow cannot afford to endanger Castro's grip on power by undercutting him too severely in economic terms.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="76"> "The regime's arms are still strong, and the army is loyal to Fidel," a European diplomat said.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="77"> "And he still exercises a moral authority unlike that of any of the fallen East European Communist leaders.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0129" num="78"> As long as the military remains behind him, he will be able to repress any challenge to his power".</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="6"> THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market this week staged its first substantial rally since it went into free-fall in mid-April.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="7"> The upturn, which began after an initial post-holiday dip to Dollars 1,785 a tonne for three months metal, was stalled for a while by resistance around the Dollars 1,850 area; but when this barrier was breached on Thursday fresh momentum was provided as investors who had gambled on further falls scrambled to cover their short positions.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="8"> That pattern was continued yesterday morning, when the three months delivery position peaked at Dollars 1,940 a tonne, but as bearish fundamentals were underlined by another rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh nine-year high profit-taking pared the price back to Dollars 1,855 a tonne at the end of after-hours trading, down Dollars 10 on the day and up Dollars 60 on the week.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="9"> The sterling quotation, which was given an extra boost by the pound's weakness, had closed afternoon ring trading at Pounds 1,262.25 a tonne, up Pounds 101.75 on the week.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="10"> Dealers said the market's strength had been bolstered by concern about possible supply disruptions in the US and Chile.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="11"> Labour contracts at Phelps dodge's Chino mine, Asarco's Ray mine and RTZ Corporation's Bingham Canyon all expire at the end of this month; while in Chile, unions at Chuquicamata, the world's biggest copper mine, on Wednesday rejected the first offer of a new two-year contract from Codelco, the state-owned mining corporation.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="12"> Meanwhile Asarco and Phelps Dodge executives told institutional investors in London this week that a sharp increase in US copper demand was far outweighing the downturn in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="13"> Mr Richard Osborne, Asarco's chairman, predicted that, as a result of this and of modestly reduced exports from former Soviet bloc countries, stocks in LME and New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) warehouses would begin to fall in the second half of this year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="14"> He was less hopeful about the outlook for zinc as stocks were so high that it would take a long time for price-induced production cuts to make a significant impact on them.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="15"> Nevertheless copper's more bullish sentiment spilled over into the LME zinc market this week and the three months price, which dipped to a six-year low of Dollars 937 a tonne on Tuesday, recovered to touch Dollars 970 yesterday, before closing at Dollars 968.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the week.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5104" num="17"> Nuova Samim, the Italian state-owned group, said it would close its Portovesme smelter for two months at a production cost of 30,000 tonnes, while MIM Holdings of Australia revealed that it planned to reduce output by 3,000 tonnes at its Britannia Refined Metals plant in Northfleet, UK, by shutting secondary (recycling) furnaces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="16"> Information Review" newscast] [Text] There is no doubt that the shortage of oil and oil by-products is the main economic problem Cuba is currently facing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="17"> It is the main hardship of the so-called special period in the aftermath of the sudden fall of eastern European socialism, particularly the fall of socialism in the former Soviet Union.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="18"> This lack of oil has had a widespread effect on all types of transportation services, because Cuba has largely relied on automotive transportation, which requires not only fuel, but also lubricants and other important products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="19"> The sugar industry, the most important industry in Cuba, which is the world's largest sugar exporter, cannot run without petroleum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="20"> However, many sugar refineries are using bagasse as the main source of fuel for their boilers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="21"> In addition, the country's electrical industry also needs hydrocarbons to generate energy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="22"> Cuba, a small country that lacks large rivers and waterfalls needed to build hydroelectric plants, has only two alternatives: thermoelectrical plants, which also need oil, and nuclear plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="23"> The construction of the nuclear plant in Juragua, in the central region, was halted when it was almost finished, because the mighty Soviet state, which was helping Cuba build its first nuclear plant, suddenly disappeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="24"> Thus, the Cuban Government is feverishly negotiating with other countries to complete this project vital to the national economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="25"> This lack of electricity introduced a new predicament to the Cuban population, which is exposed to daily power outages that last several hours, usually at times when it is most needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="26"> These brief examples allow us to visualize the problems the Cuban nation is currently facing, because the world's largest power is economically blocking and harassing it to subjugate the political resolve of the Cuban population.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="28"> Cuba has also been able to significantly increase national crude production since 1959, when the revolution succeeded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="29"> Oil production is expected to amount to 1.3 million tons this year and will continue to grow in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="30"> Large amounts of this oil used to generate electricity are too heavy and require special treatment to reduce the number of breakdowns in the industry's already worn-out equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="31"> Cuba also signed an important agreement with Russia to exchange 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of sugar this year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10797" num="32"> In addition, a joint operation with Mexico is already under way to jump start the Cienfuegos oil refinery, part of whose output will be bought by and consumed in that country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="18"> Golden Mean in Relations With Cuba; Now the Question Is Whether They Will Bring a Lot of Gold to Russia"] [Text] The visit to Russia that was concluded last week by a Cuban governmental delegation headed by Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Lionel Soto, without a doubt, marked a new Moscow and Havana rapprochement and, at the same time, a final rejection by Russia, apparently, of attempts to get "on board" in the anti-Cuban political situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="19"> The new rapprochement was documentarily consolidated in trade-economic agreements and in a general Russian-Cuban memorandum on the results of the intergovernmental negotiations that were signed last Friday.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="20"> The latter was signed by Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="21"> Soto and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Government Vladimir Shumeyko.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="22"> Besides this, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="23"> Soto and First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets signed an agreement on the same day about the founding of the Russian-Cuban economic trade association Roskuba, whose founders on the Russian side are already prepared to come out with about 30 large domestic financial-industrial and banking groups, including the association Rosneft, Tatneft, certain Urals plants, a number of nickel producers, and others.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="24"> Commenting on this agreement for the INTERFAX agency, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="25"> Shumeyko declared that it "lowers the rank of economic and trade relations from interstate relations to relations between producers".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="26"> Mr. Shumeyko did not rule out that "the signed agreements affect the interests of third countries"--those who are buying up raw sugar in Cuba in order to sell it to Russia later, but now, naturally, at other prices, and those who for political considerations would like to hinder the rapprochement of Russia and Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="27"> He added that he was not interested in political assessments of the signed agreements, no matter where they came from, and he expressed the hope that Russia henceforth will select its economic partners out of economic and not political considerations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="28"> "We have a lot in common with Cuba, despite the political disagreements, and we have found that golden mean which will make it possible for us to develop relations with this country that are mutually beneficial," Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="29"> Shumeyko generalized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="30"> Indeed, Russia has already lost a lot of money by rebuying Cuban sugar from third countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="31"> It also happened that Russia acted at the bidding of the interests of "still other" third countries--the same ones who, for their own political reasons, wanted to obstruct the Russo-Cuban rapprochement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="32"> And, for example, it shamefully abstained last year in the UN during voting on the declaration calling on the United States to remove the anti-Cuban embargo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="33"> Thus, the obstacles in the form of political prejudices have been overcome.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="34"> Not entirely, of course, because however paradoxical, the statements themselves of Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="35"> Shumeyko, as well as those of Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="36"> Soskovets, who declared that for Russia Cuba is the same as "the near abroad," contain a lot of superfluous political fervor and a desire to "rebuke" recent opponents of Russo-Cuban cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="37"> In accordance with the signed agreements, Russia will buy 1.5 million tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba next year (given an annual consumption of about 7 million tonnes and its own production--2-2.5 million tonnes).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="38"> In exchange for this, it will deliver 4 million tonnes of oil to Cuba in two stages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="39"> This ratio is considerably less profitable for Russia than that which was planned originally--2 million tonnes of Cuban sugar in exchange for 3.3 million tonnes of Russian oil and oil products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="40"> It can be assumed that the change in the proportion is associated with the catastrophic results of the Cuban sugar harvest campaign, not the least reason for which was the present departure of Russia, which was retrieving its losses, with its equipment, spare parts, and diesel oil, from the Caribbean island.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="41"> It can be supposed that Cuba should be advanced at least a little money so that it could restore its production of raw sugar, which has fallen almost by half.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="42"> Only in this case would it be good to explain the change in the original conditions of the agreement, so that doubts would not creep in about whether Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="43"> Shumeyko in fact did find the golden mean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="44"> There is one more result of the last negotiations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="45"> After they were over, Oleg Davydov, the minister of foreign economic relations of Russia, if one is to believe the television program "Vesti," made a statement for all to hear about the problem between the two countries in the form of the Cuban debt to Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="46"> And he even divulged its approximate size: More than $20 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="47"> It seems that this was the first time that such an imposing figure had come out of the mouth of a highly placed Russian government person--it had previously circulated in unofficial circles and was refuted by the Cuban side and called a fantasy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="48"> This time there were no denials, and it could be assumed that this approximate figure "was adopted as a basis".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="49"> Indeed, having reported it, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="50"> Davydov then and there made the reservation that he understands that Cuba is insolvent today, especially with respect to such large sums.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="51"> It is difficult not to agree with him, if one has in mind only the direct monetary servicing of the debt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="52"> But, after all, besides it, other forms exist.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="53"> Why not address them and receive from Cuba on account of debt servicing not sugar, of course--otherwise what will it use in exchange for Russian oil--but citrus fruit, and the wonderful Cuban rum, liqueurs, and tobacco articles, long forgotten here?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="54"> And is it not worth it in this case to wait a little with "lowering" Russian-Cuban relations from the state level to "producer levels"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="55"> It is precisely the state level that is necessary to resolve this problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="56"> But, in general, summing up: This new rapprochement has to be employed with discretion, so that it is not transformed into a new edition of an old friendship, which did not make either of the two countries rich.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="57"> Russia has many interests in Cuba, which in the past two years have been abandoned and neglected and have gone off to foreign, tenacious, and solicitous hands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="58"> And in conclusion, there is this apocrypha.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="59"> When Boris Yeltsin in 1986 stopped over in Cuba on his way to Nicaragua, where he was going as the head of a Soviet party-government delegation, Fidel himself came to the airport to meet him, although party protocol did not envision such an honor for a Politburo candidate member.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="60"> Castro liked Yeltsin very much; he looked after him incessantly, drove him around Havana himself, showing him the city--an honor that he had not bestowed on far more highly placed guests--and in the end he said about him to someone: "He is the only real Leninist in the present Soviet leadership".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61299" num="61"> Well, then, old sympathies have now received an incentive for revival.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="16"> Review" newscast] [Text] Agreements with two countries could clear up Cuba's energy future if they are ultimately implemented, allowing the island to improve its economy, whose Achilles' heel is precisely the lack of fuel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="17"> The weekly OPCIONES, which circulates in Cuba to provide information to tourists and foreign residents, said in its latest edition that Cuba and Russia ratified an agreement last December to exchange Cuban sugar for Russian petroleum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="18"> Through this agreement, Moscow would send 2.5 million tons of petroleum to the island this year in exchange for 1 million tons of unrefined sugar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="19"> A few days ago, Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello revealed both countries had signed a letter of intent to exploit, under a joint enterprise scheme, some 60,000 barrels of petroleum at the Cienfuegos refinery on the southern coast of Cuba, and to produce petroleum byproducts for sale on domestic and world markets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="20"> If the accord signed by Havana and the Mexican state-owned company Mexpetrol advances favorably, the refined product would be sold in the Cuban market and the oversupply in other nations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="21"> The origin of the current Cuban economic crisis is related to energy following the reduction in petroleum supplies from the defunct Soviet Union, which in 1989 supplied a little more than 13 million tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="22"> Cuba has been forced to get its economy going with only half of this amount, because it does not have the financial reserves to purchase all of its petroleum needs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="23"> For similar reasons, Cuba mothballed its electronuclear program launched with the Soviet Union in 1980, when investments exceeded $1.2 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="24"> For the time being, this has eliminated the possibility of reducing dependence on imported petroleum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="25"> Cuba does not have plentiful rivers, large forests, or significant coal deposits, and it only exploits wells of heavy petroleum, whose production last year hit a record of 1.1 million tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="26"> National crude oil is used in industry, the production of cement, and power-generation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="27"> Additionally, the country has resorted to foreign investments to explore new fields of light petroleum by granting risk contracts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="28"> The results of these contracts will only be known in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="29"> Even if the agreements with Russia and Mexico bear fruit, not all of the country's needs will be met.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10222" num="30"> Nevertheless, annual payments on imports would be reduced by using petroleum refined at the Cienfuegos installation, in addition to securing the Russian supply in exchange for Cuban sugar.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="16"> [Text] Havana, 14 Jan (NOTIMEX) [dateline as received) -- The Cuban Government has affirmed that in 1994 there will be a solution to the current economic crisis overwhelming the country and expressed its hopes for a reactivation of a greater sugarcane harvest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="17"> Politburo members of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) have felt the recession will bottom out in the middle of the year, but they urged the people to work more efficiently and save the scant available resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="18"> "Cuba has the perspective of recovery, and the current and next sugarcane harvests will be decisive in this endeavor," Carlos Lage, Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers secretary, has stated during a meeting with leaders of the sugar sector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="19"> According to the strategy of the current economic reforms, only the sugarcane harvest will provide the necessary resources to come out of the "special period in peacetime," as the crisis and the measures to alleviate it are called.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="20"> During the past season of its main industry, Cuba registered the lowest production in three decades (4.2 million tons), something President Fidel Castro has publicly called a disaster.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="21"> According to Lage, the 1994 to 1995 harvest will be greater than this year's.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="22"> Castro estimated in late December that the current harvest will be a few hundred tons greater than the 1992 to 1993 harvest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="23"> Since the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet Union earlier this decade, Cuba has been going through a profound crisis, with shortages of food, fuel, medicine, transportation, and other basic consumer goods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="24"> Havana has blamed the heightened U.S. economic and commercial embargo as the other cause of its woes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="25"> The last session of the National Assembly has indicated that the surplus of money in circulation--estimated at more than 12 billion pesos--and the budget deficit of approximately 4.2 billion pesos constitute the two crucial problems to be resolved immediately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="26"> In government books, the Cuban peso is at par with the U.S. dollar, but in the flourishing black market the dollar sells from between 70 to 80 pesos.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="27"> The surplus of money in circulation has led to a greater drop in efficiency, productivity, discipline, and interest in work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="28"> According to an official report, during 1993 almost 40 percent of the disciplinary measures applied against workers were prompted by unjustified absences and an interruption of working hours, something that has been compounded by "negligence, disobedience, and borderline criminal conducts".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="29"> With the state coffers almost without hard currency, without international sources of credit, the alarming government statistics also show that only 31 percent of the state enterprises are profitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="30"> "During the second half a favorable change must be noticeable in the improvement of internal finances," and the amount of fuel will be greater, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano has stated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="31"> Cuba will exchange 1.5 million tons of sugar for 4 million tons of oil, according to an agreement signed with Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="32"> Lezcano has said there are greater possibilities of moving ahead in 1994, although he admitted that in essence the same economic programs of 1993 will be maintained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="33"> These programs caused a deterioration in the people's lives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="34"> Meanwhile, the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) is apparently going to claim the responsibility for the new economic adjustment measures that have a high social cost, which the assembly will adopt to improve internal finances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="35"> The CTC is holding meetings at labor centers where speakers have suggested actions to reactive the shaky economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="36"> The sale of "bonds for the fatherland" (without interest), ceasing gratuities and subsidies, taxes, higher electricity rates, and the confiscation of wealth obtained "in an illicit manner" are some of the proposals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="37"> Economists say the true solution to the money surplus in the hands of the people is to increase production and offer industrial, farming, and service goods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="38"> "This process of consultation will make it possible to bring a consensus to the next meeting of the National Assembly," CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross has said on state-owned television.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="39"> Analysts feel the government expects that out of these meetings will come the major guidelines of the adjustment program, which includes a reduction of the bloated state apparatus and inevitable quota of greater unemployment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="40"> Government officials recognize the priority of some of the proposals but say the achievements of the Cuban socialist system, such as in the health field and free education, will be maintained at any rate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51400" num="41"> The new measures will give continuity to the reform package begun in August 1993 by the government passing a law that will allow the free circulation of foreign currency, allowing self- employment and creating cooperatives for inefficient state farming.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="13"> BFN [Text] All indications point to the fact that Cuba will not be able to offer the necessary guarantees to buy approximately 20,000 barrels of oil per day [bpd] from Colombia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="14"> Such a deal can only be carried out if the Cuban Government offers a letter of credit to Colombia -- that is, if an international bank finances its debt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="16"> In fact, countries such as Iran and Libya suspended their supply of crude because of a lack of financial guarantees.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="17"> Although the situation improved somewhat after Russia resumed the commercial exchange of oil with Cuba in January 1994, Cuba still is not in any position to pay for imports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="18"> Russia will sell Cuba 4.0 million tons of unrefined crude in exchange for 1.5 million tons of sugar this year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="19"> The government of Fidel Castro prefers to offer Colombia a three-way exchange system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="20"> This means that the companies to which Cuba sells sugar would, in turn, pay Colombia for the crude.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="21"> Many of the countries that receive sugar in exchange for oil have suspended these kinds of deals because of Cuba's enormous debts and because there is a surplus of sugar, and future production is in jeopardy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="22"> This suspension of imports heightens the already difficult energy situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="23"> Cuba only has resources to supply 40 percent of its oil needs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="24"> Even with Colombian oil, the crisis would not be resolved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="25"> Rather than crude, what Cuba needs is fuel, particularly fuel oil and diesel, to generate electricity and to compensate for its lack of hydraulic sources of power.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="26"> This is because Cuban refineries are also in a state of crisis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="27"> The plants in Havana and Santiago (built by Exxon and Shell) reportedly produce 30,000 bpd but are currently at a standstill.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="28"> The Havana plant requires investments in the order of $100 million, while the Santiago plant needs a $75 million investment to operate efficiently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="29"> Another Soviet-built plant, with the same capacity, and another located in Matanzas (which reportedly generates 5,000 bpd) are also at a standstill because of a lack of maintenance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="30"> The new refinery located in Cienfuegos has the capacity to produce 60,000 bpd, but it is not operational right now and requires an investment of approximately $200 million to produce commercially viable gasoline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="31"> Difficulties in generating electricity have forced Cuba to obtain gasoline through four international companies (Marc Rich, Vitol, Mabanet, and Totisa) which receive sugar and nickel as payment for their exports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="32"> According to the document, however, even refined imports have been reduced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="33"> These are now limited to the volumes of sugar and nickel that Cuba can offer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-10373" num="34"> For this reason, the document questions Colombia's willingness to sell oil to Cuba "while other countries have decided to suspend sales".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="11"> After a period of waning economic and political contacts in the early 199O's, marked by Russia's voting for a UN resolution condemning Cuban human rights violations and abstaining on a November 1993 resolution to lift the economic and financial blockade of Cuba, Russia now appears ready to renew and develop cooperation with its longtime political and economic client.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="12"> Agreements Signed On 3 December 1993, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov and his Cuban counterpart Isabel Allende signed agreements on reciprocal visa-free travel and scientific and cultural cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="13"> Mamedov stated that."the agreements became a logical link in the onward development of relations between Russia and Cuba" and noted the documents "are in keeping with the trend toward greater openness and democracy to which both Russia and Cuba are moving" (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1426 GMT 3 Dec 93, Daily Report FBIS-SOV-93-233 7 Dec 93 p 11).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="14"> On 24 December 1993 in Moscow, First Deputy Premiers Vladimir Shumeyko and Oleg Soskovets and Vice President of the Council of Ministers of Cuba Lionel Soto signed a memorandum on the results of bilateral negotiations and an agreement to set up a joint trade and economic association called "Roskuba," founded by approximately 3O major Russian financial, industrial, and banking groups including Rosneft, Tatneft, and Urals factories and nickel-producing plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="15"> Shumeyko declared upon signing the memorandum: "Despite political differences, we have much in common with Cuba, and we have found the golden mean which enables us to develop relations with this country on a mutually beneficial basis".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="16"> Shumeyko asserted in an apparent de-emphasis on the level of government involvement in economic decisionmaking that the "Roskuba" agreement "lowered the level of economic and trade relations to that between manufacturers".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="17"> Trade terms in the memorandum state that Russia will receive about 1.5 million tons of Cuban raw sugar in 1994 in exchange for four million tons of oil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="18"> Shumeyko noted it was possible that the agreements would affect "the interests of third world countries" that purchase Cuban raw sugar to resell it later to Russia "at other prices" and "those who would like to impede the rapprochement of Russia and Cuba on political grounds" (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1738 GMT 24 Dec 93, Daily Report FBIS-SOV-93-246 27 Dec 93 pp 28-29).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="19"> According to media commentator Leonid Velekhov, Shumeyko also remarked that "political assessments of the signed agreements, wherever they come from, do not interest him" and expressed the ambiguous hope that "Russia would henceforth select economic partners on the basis of economic, not political considerations" (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian No 1O5, 29 Dec 93 p 3, JPRS Report FBIS-USR-94-OO5 26 Jan 94 pp 56- 58).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="20"> Media Comment Media commentators from a wide range of newspapers have welcomed the revitalizations of Russian-Cuban relations: -- In his 29 December SEGODNYA article, Leonid Velekhov hailed the visit of the Cuban delegation that negotiated the trade agreement as evidence of "a new Moscow and Havana rapprochement and, at the same time, a final rejection by Russia, apparently, of attempts to get 'on board' the anti- Cuban political situation".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="21"> However, he warned that "this new rapprochement must be employed wisely, so that it does not turn into a replay of the old friendship, which made neither of the two countries rich".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="22"> Velekhov noted that after the negotiations Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov became the first Russian government official to openly divulge the amount of Cuba's debt to Russia, announcing a debt of more than 2O billion dollars during the television program "Vesti".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="23"> While Davydov stated that Cuban insolvency would preclude repayment of such a large sum, Velekhov pointed out the advantages of servicing the debt with commodities, expressing a fondness for "citrus fruit, the wonderful Cuban rum, liqueurs, and tobacco products long forgotten by us".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="24"> To achieve this, he noted, it might be worth holding off on reducing relations to "the level of manufacturers," for "to resolve this problem, it is exactly the notorious state level that is needed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="25"> -- IZVESTIYA correspondent Yevgeniy Bay welcomed moves to develop economic ties with Cuba as "quite logical on the surface".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="26"> He found the established trade terms beneficial to Russia, since "Russia can obtain from Cuba, on a stable basis and without any intermediaries, the quantity of sugar we need as and when we need it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="27"> The shipment of oil takes place over a period of a few months, which is also within Russia's capability (with the Cubans providing a concealed interest-free financing of Russian imports)".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="28"> Bay commented that some of the sugar will also be paid for by "Russian goods that are uncompetitive in the world market," noting that "only Castro would accept something that nobody else needs any more" (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 28 Dec 93 First Edition p 3, Daily Report FBIS-SOV-93-248 29 Dec 93 pp 8-9).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="29"> -- DELOVOY MIR's international correspondent Anatoliy Medvedenko argued that unless Russia presses ahead with economic ventures to overcome its past "withdrawal" from Cuba, vital opportunities will be lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="30"> He reported that 25O Cuban enterprises are in dire circumstances due to a lack of raw materials and spare parts and that the Cubans are ready to accept any proposals from Russian businessmen regarding joint ventures or capital investments with profit sharing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="31"> Medvedenko asserted that "many capitalist countries" are showing interest in Cuba, attempting "either to renew cooperation with this Caribbean country or extend contacts that already exist".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="32"> Medvedenko observed that Russia has made considerable investments in Cuba in the past, creating "a rich and far-reaching infrastructure" composed of industrial and nuclear power installations and a major oil refinery, and warned of the "quite real possibility that others will profit from the fruits of our labor" (Moscow DELOVOY MIR 23 Dec 93 p 7).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="33"> -- PRAVDA commentator Valeriy Mironov also raised the issue of past association, stating that "we should not forget the history of more than 3O years of cooperation between the former Soviet Union and the Republic of Cuba, which was our reliable political, trade and economic partner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="34"> This cooperation was fruitful and mutually advantageous in every regard".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="35"> Mironov asserted that the United States had pressured Gorbachev to curtail the Soviet Union's cooperation with Cuba, for "otherwise there would be no support for perestroyka".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="36"> Mironov argued that Russia has a moral responsibility to the Cubans, asking: "How can we talk of morality in politics seeing that we had first drawn Cuba into our sphere of influence and then looked for new friends and partners--moreover, among those who, for the last 3O years or so, have dreamed of nothing but a convenient opportunity to settle accounts with the Cuban people once and for all"? Mironov concluded: "Our friendship with the heroic Cuban people, who are currently experiencing not the best period in their history, must be maintained in whatever direction the political winds may blow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24655" num="37"> After all, history does not forgive weathervanes and traitors" (Moscow PRAVDA in Russian 5 Jan 94 p 6).</s>
