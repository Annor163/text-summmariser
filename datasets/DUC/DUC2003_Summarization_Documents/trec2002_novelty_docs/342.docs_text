</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="15"> [Text] Moscow March 2 TASS -- The recent arrest of a British secret agent, who held a high-ranking position in Russia's military industrial complex, clearly indicated that Western special services did not intend to scale down their intelligence activities in Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="16"> Not many details are available so far for obvious reasons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="17"> Thus, the name of the exposed spy is not given, the same as the duration of his work for MI-6.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="18"> But even the smallest pieces of information available show that a serious damage could be caused to Russia, because the data conveyed by the SIS agent concerned the latest developments in building various arms systems, their tactical technical parameters, funding of defence-related activities, the present condition and prospects for military technical cooperation between Russia and foreign countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="19"> Last year, 20 foreign special agents were brought to trial in Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="20"> The arrest of another spy spotlit an extremely thorny problem, that of reliable protection of our secrets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="21"> This problem is not new, but it calls for serious consideration and solution, taking into account the increasing shift towards industrial espionage in activities of special services, according to Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="22"> This holds true not only about the U.S., British and German secret services, but also to major Western corporations seeking to obtain, by any possible means, information about plans of their rivals, of which Russia [is] a key one.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="23"> For this reason, experts note, our country needs a mechanism for reliable protection of its priorities in the fields of science, technology and know-how, let alone other specific activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="24"> Otherwise, it would be more profitable for Russian specialists to sell their developments to the West, and shortly afterwards the state would have to use them on a license basis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="25"> The arrest of a British secret agent, who was caught red-handed on January 15, is not the only case in a series of spy exposures in russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="26"> Many of them were much spoken about, the others did not receive such a wide public response.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="27"> All this testifies to a continuous confrontation between the Soviet and the Russian special services and foreign ones, which has quite a long history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-15173" num="28"> Some events in this history are as follows.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="18"> But plenty has changed in the structure of the Russian security services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="19"> Names, leaders, and to a certain extent the personnel have changed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="20"> Russian counterintelligence, as the professionals themselves admit, is not having a very good time at the moment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="21"> Open borders and imperfect legislation do not help to catch spies -- and this at a time when Russia remains, as she always was, a huge source of new technology -- a fact well understood not only by Western secret services but also by ordinary commercial companies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="22"> [Aleksandr Mikhailov, head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, FSK] "There are foreign secret services on Russian territory, and they do periodically forget their sense of moderation and the fact that they are guests here, and begin to act fairly openly in their own interests".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="23"> [Correspondent] At the most approximate estimate, there are about 120,000 foreigners illegally present in Moscow and Moscow Oblast at the moment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="24"> Of course, not all of them are spies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="25"> In any case, the greatest damage is caused not by foreign spies but by our own ones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="27"> But practically everyone here earns God knows how little, so the market for potential spies here is bigger than ever.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="28"> Vadim Sintsov, alias British intelligence agent Demetrius, only worked as a spy for about a year, and was uncovered recently and is now testifying from Lefortovo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="34"> It might be simply that the British secret services got hold of documents that compromised Sintsov, and were sure that he would work with them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="35"> Sintsov got about $12,000 from the British over a year -- not much by Western standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="37"> But there are still plenty of people wanting to share state secrets with foreign powers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="38"> Just last year about 20 agents were uncovered in Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="39"> [Mikhailov] "In the West, according to our information, a fairly respectable database on our leading-edge technologies and our armaments and new inventions has already been formed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="41"> The first was Russian arms deliveries to Middle East countries, and the second was general issues of the organization of arms deliveries here".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="42"> [Correspondent] It is interesting, however, that science and technology may develop, the main methods used by agents from various countries have not changed over many years and centuries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="43"> [Mikhailov] "The main weapon, as before, is the agents".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="44"> [Correspondent] Just as before, they use compromising material to recruit, hiding places that look like canned food, special writing, and even a password when two agents meet.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="45"> As the specialists themselves say, there are intelligence services from friendly countries, but there are no friendly intelligence services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-14583" num="46"> Incidentally, just yesterday the FSK detained three DPRK embassy employees in an attempt to obtain examples of new armaments, as well as a diplomat from Africa for other espionage activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="15"> [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- "The North Korean [DPRK] Embassy in Moscow does not have to worry: None of its staffers have been `recently' expelled from Russia or will be expelled in the near future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="16"> The stir about diplomat-spies was caused by misinterpretation," head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service's public relations center Aleksandr Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS today commenting on media reports about the expel of North Korean Embassy staffers from Moscow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="17"> In the words of Mikhailov, currently on a Far Eastern trip together with service head Sergey Stepashin, the latter has noted the recently-boosted intelligence activities of some secret services, including those of North Korea, China and Japan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="18"> Stepashin thinks a reason for this is the location of Russian nuclear-powered submarine fleet in the region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="19"> As for the North Korean diplomats expelled for the attempts to purchase materiel, it was really so, said Mikhailov.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="20"> The Russian counterintelligence, intelligence and border guards held an operation to prevent drug trafficking from the DPRK to Russia before the arrival of Stepashin in the Far East.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-40593" num="21"> Some could mix the two events which resulted in misunderstanding, said Mikhailov.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="16"> [Interview with Russian Foreign Intelligence Service officer</s>
</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="17"> Boris Petrovich K., by Vladimir Sedykh; date and place not given: "Intelligence Officer at the Service of Science and Technology"] [Text] We met with Boris Petrovich K. in the mansion on a twisting Moscow street known to everyone writing on espionage topics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="18"> It houses the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FSK] press service.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="19"> As to our interlocutor, his service record in intelligence goes back as far as 1952.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="20"> Behind him are four extended foreign tours of duty and a couple of dozen short trips.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="21"> Not every experienced professional intelligence officer can boast such a service record.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="22"> All Boris Petrovich himself said, however, was that for 40 years he had been an intelligence officer at the service of science and technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="23"> [Sedykh] Please explain what you mean by this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="24"> [K.] All my career has been associated with scientific and technological [S\|[amp ]\|T] intelligence, whose main task is to track advanced foreign technologies and obtain the appropriate information, as well as samples, for the purpose of improving the scientific and industrial potential of our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="25"> The needs of the military-industrial complex [VPK], weapons of mass destruction, and developments in the area of critical technologies were given priority, of course.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="26"> That is, those areas that represented a direct threat to our national security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="27"> In the greater scheme of things, I made my own small contribution to the acceleration of scientific-technical progress.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="28"> [Sedykh] This sounds sort of academic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="29"> Why do you not give some concrete examples of useful returns from S\|[amp ]\|T intelligence, or to put it plainly, industrial espionage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="30"> [K.] Whichever name you call this line of foreign intelligence work, compared to other lines of work--political intelligence, foreign counterintelligence, illegal intelligence--S\|[amp ]\|T is the most profitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="31"> Let me start with the fact that information obtained by our staff on the problems of nuclear energy enabled Soviet science, with considerable savings in material resources and time, to create atomic weapons and deprive our main enemy of the time--the United States--of the ability to use nuclear blackmail.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="32"> We seriously helped our scientists in industrial applications of powder metallurgy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="33"> Not too many people know that S\|[amp ]\|T provided anticipatory information on the spread abroad of a dangerous illness--AIDS, and its medical and biological parameters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="34"> S\|[amp ]\|T also provided important information for the work on eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="35"> As you can see, S\|[amp ]\|T is aimed not only at perfecting technical ideas, but also protecting the interests of humanity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="36"> And there is probably no need to prove the cost-effectiveness of S\|[amp ]\|T intelligence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="37"> It has never had government handouts and never cost our taxpayers a penny.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="38"> [Sedykh] If you do not mind, let us move from the general to particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="39"> For instance, what was your work day like in intelligence?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="40"> [K.] First I would like to point out that intelligence work assumes maximum levels of strength, will power, and nerves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="41"> Naturally, I, just like my colleagues, tried not to set myself apart in any way from the bulk of our diplomats, specialists, and other "clean" personnel abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="42"> I will not reveal a great secret, however, in telling you that within half a year the special services of the country of assignment learned who is who in our colony.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="43"> While the "clean" staff of foreign representations consider themselves off duty after 1700, we continue working.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="44"> Therefore it is very important to mask your activism--explain it, for instance, by a character trait: I am such a restless person that I even work in the evenings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="45"> [Sedykh] Did you succeed?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="46"> [K.] In principle, you can fool the special services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="47"> With me, for instance, as we found out later, they assumed for a long time that I was a KGB co-optee but not that I was a career officer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="48"> Still, the most important part for us is to not expose our sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="49"> [Sedykh] How do you do that?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="50"> [K.] To mask specific interest in particular persons you have to surround yourself with numerous acquaintances and business connections, that is, official contacts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="51"> This is particularly important at the stage of assessing foreigners who potentially could be of interest from an intelligence standpoint.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="52"> With agents, you have different problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="53"> The most vulnerable area in the system of special relations is the personal meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="54"> That is why intelligence frequently resorts to impersonal forms of contacts with agents--through dead drops or radioelectronic exchange of information.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="55"> It also goes without saying that you have to be able to skillfully dodge physical surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="56"> [Sedykh] Speaking of the latter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="57"> Boris Petrovich, tell us some methods of foiling this greatest evil for an intelligence officer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="58"> [K.] In West European countries, where I worked most, the embassy and our other representations were usually under constant surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="59"> However, the resources of the opponent's special service are not limitless.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="60"> We took advantage of this; for instance, we simulated conferences or mass events at the embassy and then fanned out in the city.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="61"> They would pick up one or two of ours, but the rest would have a chance to break off.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="62"> Or, two or three intelligence officers get in a car, with the operational driver behind the wheel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="63"> At a certain point on the route--safe from the viewpoint of surveillance--the colleague who has to conduct an operation jumps out of the car and escapes surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="64"> When a meeting is planned with an especially valuable agent, or an important operation, the rezidentura as a rule also conducts countersurveillance, to make sure that the intelligence officer is not "tailed" by the opponent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="65"> I personally accustomed the surveillance to my habit of drinking coffee every day at 1100 in the same restaurant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="66"> For a day, a week, a month they dutifully followed me there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="67"> Then I noticed that they had stopped.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="68"> Once in a while they would check that I still indulged in my coffee habit, and then lay off.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="69"> This is when I went into action.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="70"> [Sedykh] Let us say you have your coffee at 1100.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="71"> Nobody follows you.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="72"> You can have a meeting with your source.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="73"> Where, and how?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="74"> [K.] Usually in restaurants--naturally, those that are not anywhere close to state and government buildings, police or gendarmerie, or military facilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="75"> I should note that the meeting place must be recorded in the rezidentura, so that none of our other people would show up there and, God forbid, bring a tail.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="76"> So we eat and drink.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="77"> I take the documents, give him the next assignment (I am generalizing, of course), the source gets the money, and we each go our own way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="78"> Sometimes the materials have to be returned to the agent in a matter of hours.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="79"> Then you have to work with a partner who copies the documents right in the car while you are having your meal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="80"> [Sedykh] Tell me please about an unexpected episode in your professional practice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="81"> [K.] There was an incident--quite recent, by the way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="82"> Therefore I will avoid details and specific descriptions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="83"> One category of our clients are the so-called walk-ins, those who on their own want to establish contact with intelligence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="84"> There was a major specialist in electronics who got into debt and decided to fix his problem by selling secrets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="85"> He came to the county where I worked.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="86"> I met him several blocks away from our embassy when he asked me "Could you give me directions to the Soviet Embassy"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="87"> My mental antennae went up and I tried to engage him in conversation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="88"> Leaving aside some details, I will only tell you that we ended the day in a restaurant; in my pocket was a microfiche of a top secret document on antimissile defense, but something was bothering me--the amount the foreigner was asking for the microcircuits exceeded all permissible standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="89"> The Center, however, authorized the deal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="90"> We decided not to wait for money from Moscow and scraped up this amount by sweeping all our foreign representations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="91"> [Sedykh] And then what?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="92"> Did he become a source?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="93"> [K.] He absolutely refused to cooperate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="94"> We approached him several times, tried to work with him on the territory of a neighboring country--no success.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="95"> [Sedykh] What about compromising materials?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="96"> [K.] Which?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="97"> We are strictly forbidden to use blackmail.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="98"> [Sedykh] How is your life in retirement now?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="99"> Are you tempted to get into battles again?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="100"> [K.] I would love to if my health permitted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="101"> I ended up with a category II disability, however, and cannot work in intelligence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="102"> So I devote my time to the collection of beer mugs I started while abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="103"> [Sedykh] Then, Boris Petrovich, the way to go for you is to join the Beer Lovers Party.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24271" num="104"> "True," the youthful-looking retired spy chuckled.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="15"> Ground for `Exotic Intelligence Services'"] [Text] The Russian authorities are concerned about the espionage activity being conducted against us by Asian countries, in particular China and North Korea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="16"> Yuriy Baturin, national security adviser to the Russian president, told foreign journalists this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="17"> As he put it, "this problem has arisen comparatively recently and is capable of being solved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="18"> We have discussed it at various levels with various departments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="19"> And now measures are being adopted to prevent the leakage of technologies, in particular dual-purpose technologies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="20"> To illustrate the espionage problem, Baturin reported that "in the past five months" Russian counterintelligence has caught red-handed a North Korean spy who was operating under diplomatic cover.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="21"> No theft of technologies by the Chinese has been observed this year, he said, although he added that there have been cases where the competent organs have discovered "approaches to top secret facilities".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="22"> In these situations, preventive measures have been adopted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="23"> Informed sources in Russian counterintelligence, commenting on the presidential adviser's remarks, confirmed that "Russia has today become a proving ground for all kinds of intelligence services, some of them exotic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="24"> The intelligence services operate in a brazen and barefaced manner".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="25"> The sources declined to comment on the detention of the North Korean or to cite examples of operations against Russia by the Chinese.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="26"> "As regards the Chinese," the sources stressed, "we are especially concerned about the spread of Chinese criminal structures, in Maritime Kray in particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="27"> [no closing quotation marks as published] It was also stressed that the existing system in China enables Beijing to make use of any citizens, whatever their status, in the interests of intelligence work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="28"> On the subject of espionage, Baturin explained the problem, in part, in terms of the economic situation in Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="29"> "I am convinced," he observed, "that if our specialists were guaranteed more appropriate living conditions, there would be no need for more active counterintelligence activity, nothing would find its way to China via these specialists, and they themselves would never leave for China".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="30"> The president's adviser also noted the wide scale of illegal immigration by Chinese people to Russia, taking place mainly via the former Union republics (in particular Kazakhstan), which are not capable of property controlling their borders with China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-39617" num="31"> As Baturin stressed, the Kremlin is interested in an agreement with Kazakhstan that would enable Russia to organize tougher security measures on the borders.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="15"> Manufacturers Have Difficulty Cooperating in Foreign Markets"] [Text] A number of France's weapons manufacturers and its intelligence services are currently involved in a misunderstanding at best or a divorce at worst.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="16"> Without actually proclaiming it from the rooftops, the former are not above accusing the latter of being of no use to them at all in the cut-throat competition that pits them against their main rival, the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="17"> The latter have willingly condemned the arms industry's inability to work with discretion, while castigating its propensity for being a blabbermouth in a world in which secrecy is the rule.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="18"> The attitude of certain French arms firms stems from deals in Asia and the Pacific and the Near or Middle East, where they feel that over the course of the past few months, the General Foreign Security Directorate (DGSE) has not given them the support they expect from its officers in the field.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="19"> If one is to believe the arms merchants, the intelligence services are unable--when they so request--to provide them, in time and with sufficient precision or even evidence, with information on the precise nature of the proposals submitted to foreign customers by their American rivals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="20"> The DGSE is supposed to have somewhat legal and occasionally even clandestine means to gain access to such files.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="21"> For the arms builders in question, this accusation could serve as an alibi for failures vis-a-vis a competitor whom they suspect of not sparing any means to win the contract.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="22"> This explanation of the divorce between the DGSE and certain French firms remains plausible, but is not sufficient since intelligence officials tacitly recognize (without singling out any one manufacturer) that it may well be recriminations that they are hearing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="23"> Nevertheless, they hasten to return the ball to the other court.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="24"> Excessively Lax, Even Imprudent</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="25"> At the root of this controversy is the so-called affair of the "leaks" in March 1993, on the heels of the legislative elections in France, when the American press published documents implicating the DGSE in acts of industrial, technological or economic espionage in the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="26"> The accusations generated strong tension in intelligence communities on both sides of the Atlantic (LE MONDE, 4 June 1993), damaged relations between the DGSE and the CIA, and forced the new "boss" of French intelligence, Jacques Dewattre, to try to restore ties with his American counterparts on a different basis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="27"> Although the documents, some of which had been doctored from what were initially authentic elements, did not emanate from the DGSE directly, everything led French agents to believe that the sending of the material to American interlocutors was the work of industrial sources that either blundered or acted out of spite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="28"> Whatever the case, the DGSE began to distrust the French industrial world, particularly the aeronautics and arms industry, which stands accused of not being able to hold its tongue and of being too lax in its exchanges with other countries, when not openly taxed with imprudence at best and a deliberate intent to do harm at worst.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="29"> From this arises the current limitations placed on the transmission of certain "sensitive" intelligence to manufacturers who want to know the position of their rival exporters across the Atlantic and, in particular, the secrets of their proposals compared with French bids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="30"> From this the discontent of major firms in the face of what seems to them to be a deliberate and discriminatory retention of its information by the DGSE has also developed.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="31"> Reorientation of Missions</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="32"> The whole affair would be no more than an anecdote if it did not actually reveal how difficult it will be to handle the transformation which most intelligence services in the world undertook at the end of the Cold War between the East and West.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="33"> Like its foreign counterparts, the DGSE works less and less on military intelligence strictly speaking and now gives priority to gathering information of a more political, economic, financial, banking, scientific, industrial or commercial nature.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="34"> Today, the quest for so-called defense intelligence makes up only 20 percent of the DGSE's overall activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="35"> This reorientation of missions poses the problem of knowing to whom to transmit information obtained in these new "niches".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="36"> When the DGSE intercepts documents on GATT, as it did during the recent trade negotiations between Europe and the United States, there is little uncertainty about the final destination of the dossier in question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="37"> But when the DGSE reads a message on the long-term strategy of a foreign firm that might threaten the activity of its French rivals, who should be informed?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="38"> The State, meaning the Elysee and the government through the agencies directly involved?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="39"> Or certain specially designated ministries?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="40"> Or, more directly, the national or private enterprise in the sector involved, provided that the intelligence services--which have no mandate to do so--interfere in the French industrial fabric by giving preference to one company over another in the same sphere of activity?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="41"> The questions go unanswered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="42"> In practice, the intelligence services in France and abroad seek to identify a hand-picked official, the duly-empowered CEO or general manager, to come consult the file on site, even refusing the right to photocopy the document.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="43"> All things considered, it is a delicate affair.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="44"> It is not always enough to allay the vigilance of intelligence professionals, now distrustful of anyone not sharing their natural or excessive obsession with secrecy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19264" num="45"> It has also occurred to manufacturers that they would henceforth be better served by setting up their own intelligence networks or by calling upon the services of professionals!</s>
