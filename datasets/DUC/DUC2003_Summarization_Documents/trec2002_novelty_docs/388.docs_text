<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="21"> National signs undergo the test of time and, as a rule, are justified.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="22"> Truly, the March snow adds moisture to the ground and ensures that the plants have moisture during the first months of growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="23"> It is unfortunate that full use will not be made of this gift of nature: a nutrient shortage in the soil over a periof of three years has defined the existence of the crops for six months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="24"> The situation could be saved by mineral fertilizer, but the amount accumulated for the spring field work is less by a factor of eight than that which the farms had during the so-called stagnant years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="25"> In late February, the government of Russia allocated special purpose credits and 30-percent subsidies for the acquisition of mineral fertilizer and yet it is doubtful if this will save the situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="26"> Therefore, special importance is being attached to managing our fertilizer resources in an efficient manner so as to realize a maximum return from them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="27"> The undersowing of winter crops, unfertilized fallow fields and late fall plowed fields and a large volume of spring plowing work -- all of these factors demand the introduction of corrections into the plans for fertilizer use in 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="28"> Winter grain crops.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="29"> Since autumn, many farms have not had an opportunity to enrich the fields with nutrients.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="30"> Even farms in Krasnodar Kray sowed more than one half of their winter crops without fertilizer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="31"> The moisture supplies in the 1-meter layer of soil are higher than normal in practically all areas and this will ensure normal plant development during the first two months of growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="32"> But even the small supplies of nitrogen have been washed out of the surface soil by the autumn rainfall and will be unavailable for plant nourishment in the early spring.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="33"> According to data supplied by the agrochemical service, the winter grain crops in practically all areas are in need of a nitrogen fertilizer top dressing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="34"> The planning and research centers of the agrochemical service, at the request of the farms and private farmers, are conducting plant diagnoses and the plant protection stations -- phyto-sanitary inspections of the crops and issuing recommendations for the use of fertilizer and pesticides.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="35"> Weak winter crops, and there are many of them in the southern regions, should be given a top dressing using higher dosages of nitrogen -- 45-60 kilograms per hectare.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="36"> This will intensify the tillering and increase the plant stand density.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="37"> On the left bank of the Volga, where a summer droght is possible, the nitrogen dosages should ideally be reduced to 20 kilograms per hectare.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="38"> Intensive crops require a root dressing using nitrogen and complex fertilizers, with application to the ground being carried out using grain drills.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="39"> The tilling of mature soil should be carried out along the drill rows.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="40"> In the process, the plow itself will find the inter-row spacing -- the top dressing is combined with loosening of the soil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="41"> We recommend the extensive use of tank mixtures of fertilizers, pesticides and plant growth regulators.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="42"> In addition to making it possible to utilize aviation and ground equipment more effectively, this will also lower expenditures for toxic chemicals per unit of area so treated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="43"> In the absence of fungicides for preventing fungus diseases, solutions of potassium chloride and ZhKU can also be used in the tank mixtures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="44"> This simple agrotechnical method will also make it possible to strengthen the straw and to reduce lodging to a certain degree.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="45"> A high probability of lodging in winter wheat and rye is forecast for the central chernozem region, Ulyanovsk and Orenburg oblasts and for Tataria and Bashkiria.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="46"> The rayon associations of "Selkhozshimiya" must find supplies of campozan and tura.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="47"> According to our data, they are available in various areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="48"> Last year, a top dressing was applied to practically all of the winter crops in the Tatarstan and Mariy El republics, in Krasnodar Kray and in Belgorod, Ulyanovsk, Ryazan, Tversk and a number of other oblasts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="49"> Despite equal opportunities, less than one half of the crops in Rostov, Samara, Penza and Nizhegorod oblasts were given a top dressing and this can only be explained by the unsatisfactory work performed by specialists attached to the agronomic and agrochemical service.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="50"> Field work in southern Russia is being carried out at a maximum tempo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="51"> More than one half of the crops in the Kuban region have already been given a top dressing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="52"> The first aircraft have appeared above the fields in the central chernozem and central Volga regions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="53"> More than 600 aircraft have been prepared for applying top dressings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="54"> However, agreements for carrying out aviation chemical work have been concluded for only two million hectares, or one fourth of the requirement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="55"> The Belgorod "Selkhozkhimiya" Association, for example, reached an agreement with supplier plants for a shipment of ammonium nitrate with no pre-payment for proper storage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="56"> As a result, the oblast's farms were fully supplied with nitrogen for applying a top dressing to their winter grains and perennial grasses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="57"> The possibility exists in many regions of exchanging agricultural products for fertilizer and pesticides.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="58"> Certainly, given the present price for grain, fertilizer and aviation chemical work, only an increase in yield can compensate for the expenses incurred.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="59"> But it can be stated with confidence that each ruble invested in a top dressing produces a return of two rubles' worth of additional product.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="60"> Spring crops.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="61"> A great amount of attention should be devoted to the start-up fertilizer used in drill rows during sowing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="62"> This method can produce a maximum effect with minimal expenditures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="63"> In the case of spring plowing, and the volumes of such work have increased considerably, the plants will experience a shortage of nitrogen in the spring, especially when a large amount of culmiferous residue is added to the soil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="64"> Thus it is best to add all round fertilizer together with the seed -- each granule containing nitrogen and phosphorus.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="65"> A mandatory agrotechnical rule prevails for the Volga region, the southern Ural area and Siberia -- drill row fertilization, with phosphorus, of spring wheat plantings on fallow fields.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="66"> Phosphorus fertilizer helps the plants to take root better and, by accelerating growth, enables them to withstand the effects of drought conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="67"> In the spring, an attempt should be made to avoid extensive fertilizer applications with light tilling, since such placement leads to vigorous weed growth, with no materials being available to deal with them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="68"> The weeds become strong competitors against cultivated plants for the utilization of moisture and nutrients.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="69"> This year the local fertilizing of row crops should be combined with top dressings during the growing season.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="70"> This method can be used very well with loosening of the soil and with combating weeds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="71"> Last year, one out of every four hectares of sugar beets in Voronezh, Tambov and Penza oblasts was not fertilized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="72"> At that time, the beets in the mentioned regions did not enjoy a "sweet" life and thus it should come as no surprise to learn that their productivity declined by 30 percent compared to the average annual figure for the 1986-1990 period.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="73"> Fertilization in behalf of sunflowers should be discussed separately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="74"> It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this crop in solving the food problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="75"> Why then is it viewed as a stepchild?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="76"> As a rule, it is consigned to last place in a crop rotation plan and thus there can be no discussion regarding the residual effect of nutrients.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="77"> Last year, 15 kilograms of fertilizer were applied per hectare of sunflower planting in Tambov Oblast, 10 kilograms in Penza and Samara and five kilograms per hectare in Orenburg Oblast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="78"> Generally speaking, such fertilization was overlooked in Saratov Oblast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="79"> And here they obtained 4.5 quintals of oil-bearing seed per hectare, or two times less than the average amount for Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="80"> Farmyard manure and compost remain the principal fertilizers for potatoes and vegetables.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="81"> Last year, throughout Russia on the whole, organic fertilizer was applied to less than one half of the potato-growing area and only to one out of every six hectares of vegetable crop.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="82"> Farms in Tula, Voronezh, Volgograd, Kurgan, Novosibirsk and Amur oblasts were unable to procure enough farmyard manure for this purpose.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="83"> Certainly, if a potato and vegetable yield of 80-100 quintals or less per hectare is considered normal, then it is possible to manage with the soil's natural fertility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="84"> This year, the best periods for transporting organic fertilizer for winter crop purposes have already elapsed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="85"> Owing to an absence of requests from the farms, the mechanized detachments of "Selkhozkhimiya" were forced to release machine operators on unpaid vacation time or the latter had to seek work on the side, including in neighboring oblasts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="86"> Over a period of two months, two times less organic fertilizer was delivered to the fields than during the same period for last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="87"> Thus we recommend the use of farmyard manure for vegetables and potatoes and also in farm crop rotation plans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="88"> Applications of low dosages of fresh unprepared farmyard manure in field crop rotation plans must also be eliminated and it must not be removed from manure piles by bulldozers and toothless drag harrows, since this leads to strong contamination of the crops, lodging and irregular ripening and also to an excessive accumulation of nitrates in the products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="89"> The fertilization of irrigated crops is deserving of special attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="90"> Indeed, all irrigation expenses are justified only when guaranteed high yields are obtained from these lands, regardless of weather conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="91"> There are approximately 400,000 hectares of irrigated land in Saratov Oblast, the fertilization of which requires 80,000-90,000 tonnes of mineral fertilizer in active agent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="92"> Meanwhile, the farmers in Saratov Oblast received only 15,000 tonnes last year for all of their land -- both irrigated and non-irrigated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="93"> It comes as no surprise to learn that the productivity of an irrigated hectare turned out to be three times lower than the figure planned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-22502" num="94"> Nor is the situation any better in Volgograd, Penza and Omsk oblasts, in the Altay Kray or in the republics of Dagestan and Kalmykia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="17"> But, China's land environment has been deteriorating for many years, and the question of how to deal with it becomes more critical every day, as it directly affects agricultural development, and by extension, the stability of the society, the economy, and the government.</s>

</H8>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="20"> There is only.086 hectare of cultivated land per person in China, one-third of the world average of .32 hectare.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="21"> Less than one in ten of all the fields of the 95.7 million hectares of cultivated land have high and sustainable productivity, and there are 15 million hectares of low-productive, saline-alkaline, marshy, frigid, red-earth, water-eroded, sand-blown, arid, and coastal beach lands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="22"> Cultivated land is becoming a scarce resource, and this has not been given sufficient attention or has been overlooked for a long time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="23"> In the 20-year period from 1957 to 1977, 29.3 million hectares of arable land have been used for various kinds of construction or abandoned to waste, while 17.3 million hectares have been brought under cultivation, a net loss of 11.2 million hectares, equivalent to the sum of the cultivated areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan, an average loss per year of the total cultivated land in Fujian.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="24"> From 1978 to 1990, 307,000 hectares of cultivated land disappeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="25"> According to international standards, the danger point is reached when cultivated land is reduced to .053 hectare per person, and China's is presently at .086 hectares per person.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="26"> Among the 26 countries with the highest ratio of cultivated land to population, China places 24th, and with the population increasing at a rate of 16 million per year, having reached 1.16 billion by 1 July 1990, will top 1.3 billion by the end of the century.</s>

<H8>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="31"> The Problems</s>
</H8>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="32"> The deterioration of land environment is the result of the disappearance and degradation of land caused by various kinds of natural and social activities which leads to the loss of and damage to the land environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="33"> There are six primary manifestations.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="34"> (1) Hundreds of Thousands of hectares of Arable Land</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="35"> Disappear Every Year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="36"> The old pattern of ever expanding arable land in China reversed itself in 1957, and the downward trend has been getting worse day by day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="37"> Since 1978 the annual loss has been as high as 307,000 hectares.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="38"> The primary causes are as follows: 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="39"> The demand for living space is increasing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="40"> With steady increase in farm incomes and reduction in the size of farm families, old farm dwellings are being repaired and new ones built, and rural villages are constantly expanding.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="41"> Investigations have found that in the 4 years from 1985 through 1988, 277,000 hectares of farm land have been taken up for the construction of farm dwellings, and one-third of all the farm land in the country has been taken for construction of every kind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="42"> In 1990, 24,000 hectares of land was converted to farm dwellings, and the area of village housing grew, and as living space encroached on the surrounding farm land, arable land disappeared day by day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="43"> 2. Capital construction is swallowing up the land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="44"> Economic growth since 1978 has caused a boom in capital construction to improve the economic and investment environment on every level and by any means, and a lot of land has been taken out of agriculture; and because of reckless and incautious land management operations, many construction units are grabbing land for use later or taking land they don't use, and a lot of it is good land in cities towns and villages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45740" num="45"> Besides that, there is a fever from top down for building roads, for village and town enterprises, city construction, real estate, and for opening up zones, are all important factors in the disappearance of farmland.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="6"> The idea that your breakfast cereal or toast began life being fertilised with sewage sludge may not be very appealing.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="7"> But it seems this will increasingly be the case.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="8"> Some 42 per cent of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in the UK each year is already applied to cereal and industrial crops and to grassland.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="9"> The quantity is expected to rise sharply in the next 12 years as European Union regulations on effluent treatment double the amount of sludge produced.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="10"> Sludge will also need a new home when dumping at sea is banned in 1998.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="11"> UK farmers could save between Pounds 15m and Pounds 22m a year on chemical fertilisers, and obtain similar results, by opting for sludge, says Mark Aitken, environmental scientist at the Scottish Agricultural College.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="12"> Aitken will tell local authority and water company representatives at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow today that sludge contains nitrogen and phosphorus - important plant nutrients - and organic matter, which improves the soil's ability to hold water.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="13"> But he will emphasise the need for careful analysis since it can also contain heavy metals and organisms that cause salmonella and other diseases.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="14"> Fields must be tested, too, for suitability for sludge application.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="15"> Sewage sludge is not used to grow fruit and vegetables in case any bacteria splash on to the crop and are not washed off.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="16"> But it is safe for cereals because it is applied when plants are young, before the edible ears have grown.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="17"> 'The plant is also quite discriminating and doesn't transmit any contaminants to the edible portion,' says Aitken.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="18"> The prospect of more sludge being recycled free of charge on fields is likely to worry fertiliser manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="FT941-9169" num="19"> Aitken admits it may also be resisted by farmers preferring an inorganic fertiliser which they have used successfully for 20 years to 'some nasty brown stuff'.</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="6"> Unlikely though it may seem, a combination of European Union regulations and green consumerism could result in freeze-dried sewage sludge for sale in supermarkets.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="7"> This product idea, based on converting human waste into soil fertiliser, is a result of the response of Wessex Water, one of Britain's privatised water companies, to the EU's 1991 urban waste water directive banning dumping of sewage sludge at sea by the end of 1998.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="8"> A third of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in Britain was dumped at sea in 1991; last year, 22 per cent was disposed of in this way.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="9"> The directive also demands an increased number of sewage treatment works to cover coastal towns by 2006.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="10"> The amount of sludge produced by the treatment process is expected to double as a result.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="11"> The water industry has been forced to develop a number of processes - some more traditional than others - to deal with the sludge in a way which is environmentally acceptable and cost-effective.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="12"> Clive Coombes, a process scientist with WS Atkins, the UK engineering consultants, wrote in Water Bulletin, a trade journal, last year: 'Sludge treatment to produce materials that can be marketed at a profit is something of a Holy Grail for the water industry'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="13"> Richard Lacey, Wessex Water's divisional manager for waste water, says: 'This is a problem for the whole of the UK water industry.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="14"> Millions of pounds are being spent doing something about it'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="15"> Almost half of the UK's sewage sludge is now used to fertilise agricultural land.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="16"> Liquid sludge is rich in phosphates and nitrogen.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="17"> But it has a number of inherent disadvantages; chief among these are smell, a content that includes heavy metals and the ability to pollute water courses.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="18"> It is also, in its bulky wet form, expensive to transport.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="19"> Wessex Water ended 25 years of dumping Bristol's sludge into the sea when it built a Pounds 7.5m biodrier 18 months ago.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="20"> The Swiss-built equipment, four times larger than any other in Europe and the only one on mainland Britain, dries, pasteurises and sieves the fermenting sludge into odourless, even-sized granules of one-twentieth the volume.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="21"> The drying gases used in the process are recycled, as is 70 per cent of the heat used.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="22"> Methane gas is produced by heating the fermenting sludge.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="23"> The surplus energy created from this is sold to the national grid under the non-fossil fuel obligation, earning Wessex Water an estimated Pounds 1m a year.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="24"> The biodrier now produces between 30 and 40 tonnes of granules a day from 45 per cent of all Wessex Water's liquid sludge.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="25"> The process means the end product is easy to transport.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="26"> The company has reduced its lorry loads of sludge per year from 150,000 pre-biodrier to 100,000.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="27"> Most of Biogran, the name of the granules, is sold for use on agricultural land, but purchasers also include the Forestry Commission, British Coal (for use on land reclamation sites) and golf courses.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="28"> In one of Wessex Water's promotional pictures, a group of golfers happily putt away while sludge is spread on the course.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="29"> At a cost of approximately Pounds 100 per tonne of Biogran, Wessex Water intends to make a good return on its initial investment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="30"> To help it do so, the company aims to branch out into the horticultural and domestic markets.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="31"> It is holding talks with the Department of the Environment and the European Commission to redesignate the product as suitable for these markets.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="32"> Biogran's use is currently controlled, along with other sludge products, by the UK department's sewage to agricultural land regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="33"> According to Lacey, the biodrier process changes the nature of the sludge 'beyond all recognition'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="34"> Samples are currently being tested in Brussels, and Lacey says he hopes for a decision on the redesignation by the summer.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="35"> The company even plans to apply for an ecolabel, a badge of environmental approval for supermarket-type goods awarded by the UK ecolabelling board and replicated throughout the EU.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="36"> 'We feel that we've entered the easier markets, so to speak, and have been successful.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="37"> Now we want a chance to enter the harder horticultural and domestic markets,' says Lacey.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="38"> So far, Wessex Water has built only one other biodrier for a water authority in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="39"> Other water companies have developed different methods to meet the EU directive.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="40"> Environment department estimates suggest that incineration will increase by the largest percentage after the sea option is no longer available.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="41"> Thames Water awarded contracts valued at Pounds 125m last month for two incinerators to deal with the 4m tonnes of sludge being disposed of in the North Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="42"> The company said that deployment of the sludge to agricultural land was limited because of the lack of available land within the Thames region.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="43"> At Anglian Water, trials involving composting the sludge with other biodegradable materials such as vegetable or 'green' waste are taking place.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="44"> Peter Matthews, director of water services at Anglian, is an adviser to the Japanese sewage works association.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="45"> He says that while technology there - able to convert sludge into material suitable for jewellery - is impressive, it is suitable only for large conurbations such as Tokyo.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="46"> The Japanese, he says, are envious of the British capacity for sludge recycling on to the land.</s>

<s docid="FT941-427" num="47"> 'In this country, we have very good opportunities for doing other land-based things with sludge.'</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="12"> First, start with a small plot of land -- say, no more than 100 square feet.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="13"> A 10-by-10-foot square produces 100 square feet, but a plot with such dimensions would be hard to maintain because you couldn't reach the center without walking on the soil.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="14"> And a cardinal rule of good gardening is to avoid walking on, and thus compacting, garden soil.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="15"> Better to design a long, narrow bed, with dimensions such as 4-by-25 feet.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="18"> But each year they fizzled out after mother left.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="19"> Main problem?</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="20"> Insufficient water.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="21"> Sooner or later, a gardener who relies solely upon hand watering will fail.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="22"> Overhead sprinklers work well when plants are small.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="23"> However, as plants grow tall and bloom, the flowers are knocked over by the water from the sprinklers.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="24"> I've started to use irrigation hoses called "leaky pipe".</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="25"> These hoses lie on the surface of the soil (or can be buried just below) and ooze water to the root area.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="26"> After assuring water, get the soil ready for digging.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="27"> It's usually best to water the target area a few days before you plan to dig.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="28"> Moist, but not soggy soil is easiest to turn over.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="29"> But how do you know whether your soil is too soggy to dig?</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="30"> Use the hand-squeeze test.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="31"> Soil is ready to dig if a handful crumbles when squeezed; if instead it makes a dense ball, wait for it to dry somewhat.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="32"> Next, a step that many gardeners underestimate: use organic soil amendment in preparing the soil.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="33"> The least expensive is redwood amendment or redwood compost; these additives improve any soil, whether it's clay or sandy.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="34"> Be sure that the amendment you choose has been either composted (allowed to break down naturally) or nitrolized (had nitrogen added).</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="35"> Even though my own garden soil is excellent loam, I add many bags of KRA organic amendment or Bandini soil builder each time I plant.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="37"> For a 100-square-foot plot, use four 3-cubic foot bags of amendment.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="39"> Fertilizer should also be added at this time.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="43"> Now comes the fun.</s>

<s docid="LA021190-0042" num="44"> Spading a garden -- if it's small and if you spread the task over a couple of days -- is one of life's genuine pleasures.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="22"> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: East Valley Farms, Inc. has proposed to lease a 40-acre allotment from Joseph Kintano of the Torres Martinez Band of Cahuilla Indians for the purpose of constructing and operating a biosolids (digested sewage sludge) composting facility.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="23"> The facility would be operated by Pima Gro Systems, Inc., a sister company of East Valley Farms.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="24"> The facility would receive daily shipments of treated Class B sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants at other locations in southern California.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="25"> Approximately 15,000 tons per month of sludge would be delivered to the facility by truck.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="26"> Pima Gro proposes to use an aerated windrow compost process to produce 8,000 tons per month of fully treated and composted material.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="27"> The compost product would be sold to agricultural users and nurseries for use as a soil amendment.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="28"> The project site is located in the Coachella Valley in south-central Riverside County approximately 35 miles southeast of the city of Palm Springs.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="29"> The project vicinity is generally rural with agriculture and aquaculture being the predominant land uses.</s>

<s docid="FR940812-2-00278" num="30"> The EIS will address numerous environmental issues, including: geology and soils, water quality, air quality, (including odor and dust), health and safety, biological resources, cultural resources, traffic, land use, and noise, as well as any additional issues raised during the scoping process.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="6"> Robert Goodwin is at the cutting edge of farming technology.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="7"> He is one of five British farmers involved in a pioneering project to grow willow and poplar as a fuel crop that is commercially viable and kind to the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="8"> Winter is a busy time on Goodwin's 75-hectare cereal farm in Essex, 50 miles north-east of London.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="9"> This is when the one-year-old trees have to be cut back, or coppiced, so the stumps sprout.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="10"> The new shoots, which can grow up to four metres in the first year, will be harvested after two to five years and turned into woodchips to be burned for electricity.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="11"> Coppicing of woodland goes back to the middle ages.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="12"> But growing tree crops for fuel on arable land has only taken root in Europe in the past few years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="13"> Sweden, with vast forests and a strong commitment to renewable energy, already has about 9,000 hectares under commercial production.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="14"> Now farmers in the European Union are becoming interested because of the introduction of compulsory set-aside, under which they can grow non-food crops without forfeiting subsidies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="15"> The National Farmers' Union will debate the issue at its annual meeting in London today.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="16"> Cereals and oilseeds, straw and farm waste are all being tried for fuel.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="17"> But arable coppice is seen in Britain as having the greatest potential, in terms of cost and impact on the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="18"> The government is funding the Pounds 1.1m five-farm project and last year included coppice in the list of non-fossil fuels from which electricity companies are obliged to obtain some of their power.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="19"> Goodwin, whose family has grown willow for cricket bats for a century, is enthusiastic about the new use of the tree.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="20"> 'As far as its environmental attractiveness is concerned, I don't see anything coming close to it,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="21"> Although weed-killer is used to protect the young trees in their first year, coppice does not need constant applications of agrochemicals during its 30-year lifespan.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="22"> The nutrients in soil previously used to grow cereals, coupled with annual leaf fall, can replace fertiliser.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="23"> Sewage sludge can also be used, offering one solution to the problem of disposal that will arise when dumping sludge at sea is banned in 1998.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="24"> The trees attract wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="25"> 'We have found more than 40 species of bird within our plantations,' saysGoodwin.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="26"> 'We wouldn't have seen a fraction of those under cereal production'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="27"> Access is provided for walkers and riders to open space around the trees, and there should be none of the visual objections associated with wind turbines.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="28"> The burning process is surprisingly clean, too.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="29"> Coppice releases no more carbon dioxide when burned than it absorbs during growth, emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are low and the ash can be recycled as fertiliser.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="30"> The wood crop produces about 30 times the energy used to grow and harvest it, compared with an energy ratio of less than two-to-one for the diesel substitute made from oilseed rape.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="31"> Establishing a plantation is currently expensive at Pounds 1,300 or more a hectare.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="32"> But grants are available from the Forestry Authority.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="33"> The government is also considering encouraging coppice production on fixed set-aside land by 'rolling up' five years' worth of subsidies into a lump sum of about Pounds 1,550 a hectare in the first year.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="34"> The expectation is that coppice will require little or no financial support once established as a commercial crop.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="35"> With such attractions, many farmers are contemplating coppice as a way of sustaining rural employment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="36"> But most are hesitant until there is a proven market.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="37"> That is why a group of farmers and businessmen set up Border Biofuels in 1992 to build power plants fuelled by woodchips.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="38"> The company is applying for a licence for a 5MW plant - enough to supply electricity to a small town - near St Boswells in the Scottish Borders.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="39"> Initially the Pounds 6m plant would burn forestry residue but this would gradually be replaced by coppice.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="40"> The company hopes to assemble 30 or more farmers growing up to 2,000 hectares to supply the plant.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="41"> 'It's a commercial crop with a margin comparable to cereals, subject to the market being established,' says Harry Frew, a director.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="42"> Once coppice took off, cuttings would become widely available and the high cost to new entrants of about 10p a cutting could be slashed to 1p or 2p.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="43"> Several regional electricity companies are interested as well.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="44"> South Western Electricity (Sweb) is applying to build a 2.5MW power plant in Cornwall, using 18,000 tonnes of dry coppice a year from local growers.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="45"> It has plans for three other wood-fuelled plants of 5MW to 10MW in Hampshire, Suffolk and Northamptonshire.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="46"> 'We're keen to break this chicken-and-egg situation of no-crop-no-market and no-market-no-crop,' says Gerry Swarbrick, power resources manager.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="47"> 'We believe renewables deserve a chance to demonstrate themselves on a commercial basis.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="48"> We expect these technologies will one day stand on their own two feet'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="49"> There is a long way to go.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="50"> The UK government aims to stimulate a modest 1,500MW of new electricity-generating capacity from renewable sources by the end of the decade - about 3 per cent of the country's electricity needs.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="51"> Coppice would initially be a tiny part of that, with only about 100 hectares so far being grown.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="52"> But the government-sponsored Renewable Energy Advisory Group presented a striking vision of its potential as the technology improves.</s>

<s docid="FT941-10541" num="53"> It forecast that if 2.8m hectares - 16 per cent of agricultural land - were turned over to coppice by 2010, the energy created could amount to 22 per cent of electricity consumption.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="11"> Spurred by a five-year state deadline to reduce trash by 25%, six of Ventura County's 10 cities now pick up at least a portion of their residents' recyclables at the curb, officials say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="12"> The programs by Ventura, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula, Fillmore and Ojai divert about 750 tons a week from rapidly filling county landfills.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="13"> Oxnard, which already recycles about 50 tons a week through a program for businesses, will decide Tuesday whether to move ahead with a 3,000-home curbside pilot program for residences in December.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="14"> Moorpark could have a program for 500 homes by next month, but Camarillo and Port Hueneme are still in planning stages for curbside programs, city officials said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="15"> City-sponsored programs to pick up bottles, cans, cardboard and newspapers at curbside are convenient for residents and popular politically, officials say.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="16"> But they bring contention as well.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="17"> The flurry of recycling activities -- the result of legislation known as AB 939 requiring cities to reduce trash sent to landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000 -- sets the stage for trash turf skirmishes countywide.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="18"> Cities may line up against a regional agency for control of the trash, and private trash haulers against private recyclers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="19"> Michael Smith, senior vice president at Simi Valley's GI Industries, which hauls rubbish for four east county cities and operates a recycling processing center, said Ventura County should meet the state mandates with no problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="20"> "I think our county is going to be way ahead of the rest of the state in meeting our 939 goals," Smith said of the state's legislation.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="21"> "The haulers are doing all they can and the cities like to be involved because it's great for them politically".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="22"> In Simi Valley and Ventura, the two cities considered the front-runners in county recycling, private processing centers sort and ship recyclables to markets around the state, country and world.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="23"> Ventura's Intermediate Processing Center, operated by Gold Coast Recycling, is by far the most sophisticated in the county with its indoor operation and state-of-the art machinery, officials say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="24"> The Ventura curbside recycling program, which reroutes about 300 tons of trash a week into the recycling center, costs Ventura about $500,000 annually, but it's well worth the money, said Terry Adelman, the city finance director who heads the city's recycling program.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="25"> "It's doing the right thing for the county and the environment," said Adelman, who has dubbed himself the "director of cash and trash".</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="26"> "It's keeping trash out of the landfill that only has three years left, and it will be cheaper in the long run than using a landfill".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="27"> As the amount of recyclables handled goes up, the fixed costs of buildings and machinery go down, Adelman said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="28"> Simi Valley is setting up recycling bins in six shopping centers and plans to open a drop-off center for paints, motor oil and other household hazardous wastes this fall, in addition to a citywide curbside program.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="29"> Elsewhere in the county, Fillmore, Santa Paula and Thousand Oaks have begun an innovative program in conjunction with the Ventura Regional Sanitation District that mixes yard cuttings with sewage sludge to produce a soil fertilizer.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="30"> The Regional Sanitation District uses the mixture to help its landscaping at the closed Coastal landfill.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="31"> e district, a nonprofit public agency directed by a board of representatives from western Ventura County cities, operates landfills at Oxnard and Toland Road between Fillmore and Santa Paula.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="32"> As the successes of recycling programs countywide continue to mount, so does the competition for contracts and trash.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="33"> Two processing center operators -- Gold Coast in Ventura and GI Industries in Simi Valley -- want to build plants in the east county to handle recyclables collected in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and the Santa Rosa Valley.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="34"> Further, Gold Coast, which already receives recyclables at its Ventura facility from Ventura, Oxnard, Fillmore and Santa Paula, is negotiating with the city of Camarillo and plans to approach Port Hueneme, Gold Coast Manager Chris R.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="35"> Webb said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="36"> But the Regional Sanitation District, which will have only the small Toland Road landfill left after the Bailard landfill in Oxnard closes in 1993, also plans its own processing center.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="37"> It is in the midst of a years-long planning process to build a center in Saticoy or Oxnard that is bigger than that of Gold Coast or GI Industries.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="38"> The Regional Sanitation District's center, which officials hope will open in 1993, could serve Camarillo, Oxnard and Port Hueneme, said Resource Recovery Manager Mike Ewens.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="39"> It was originally designed to serve the city of Ventura as well, but the city beat the sanitation district to the punch.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="40"> "We tried to work with Regional Sanitation," Ventura Finance Director Adelman said.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="41"> But the district was unwilling to pursue the necessary county permits to operate a sorting center at its Bailard landfill in Oxnard, and the city wanted to begin working toward the state-mandated goal to reduce its 1,750 tons of trash a week to 1,312 tons a week.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="42"> With about 300 tons a week diverted now, the city is on its way, Adelman said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="43"> "The problem is, Regional Sanitation is still talking about it," Adelman said.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="44"> "It might have been a little embarrassing, but we had to get on line".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="45"> At the bottom of the pile in the battle over bottles, cans, paper and cardboard is the private recycler, area businesses say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="46"> With city contracts that guarantee Gold Coast and GI Industries a certain profit, the cities are subsidizing two private companies and making it difficult for a small-potatoes recycler to turn a buck, said Wade Schlosser, president of the privately owned Simi Valley Recycling.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="47"> With their earnings guaranteed, Gold Coast and GI Industries can unload their products at a price that ruins the market, Schlosser said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="48"> "It doesn't matter to them if they make a profit or not," Schlosser said.</s>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="49"> "All they understand is whatever they get stuck with, they will pass the cost on to somebody else".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="50"> Schlosser and other recyclers, on the other hand, have to bear the costs of the changing markets for recycled materials, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="51"> In addition, the cities should have chosen longtime recycling companies for their processing contracts instead of two companies associated with rubbish haulers, Schlosser said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="52"> GI Industries has trash-hauling contracts in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Moorpark, while Harrison and Sons, a part owner in Gold Coast, hauls trash in Ventura and other western county cities.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="53"> "If you want to recycle, why not go to someone who's been in the business for 10 years, not some garbage company that learned about recycling yesterday," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081990-0087" num="54"> Dan Murphy, owner of D&J Recycling in Ventura, said he fears that Gold Coast will eventually open a so-called buyback center to the public, in which individuals trade their recyclables for cash.</s>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="10"> That may sound far-fetched to some people, but not to Bill Becker, general manager of the Southeast Regional Reclamation Authority.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="11"> Becker is considering what could happen as a result of a pilot program now being conducted by the 12 member districts of the reclamation authority and the Aliso Water Management Agency.</s>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="12"> The program involves testing a mixture of sewer sludge and sawdust in experimental compost piles at Rancho Mission Viejo.</s>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="13"> The process could eventually allow Orange County sanitation agencies to enter the fertilizer market.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="14"> "Our trucks could follow the trash trucks and fill the empty trash cans part way with fertilizer that homeowners could use," Becker said.</s>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="15"> "That way we could recycle the material to residents in their empty trash cans instead of taking it to a landfill".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="16"> Sewer sludge is composed of the raw solids left after sewage is treated.</s>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="17"> Each person produces about a pound of sludge a day, Becker said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="18"> For the composting, two parts of sawdust are mixed with one part sludge and heated in the sun to produce a useful fertilizer that is relatively odorless, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="19"> Most county reclamation facilities now either dump sewer sludge into landfills or pay to have it trucked to sites as far away as Utah to be used in fertilizers, Becker said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="20"> Becker said the Orange County program is modeled after one in Los Angeles County, where sanitation districts use a 20-acre compost site in Carson and work with a contractor, Kellogg's Nitrohumus Co., to distribute the material.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA082590-0116" num="21"> A site of about 3 acres in Chiquita Canyon is being used for the Orange County pilot program, and the Chino-Corona Nursery will test-market the material, Becker said.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="7"> TO SAVE that camellia and beat the hosepipe ban, you splash down two flights of stairs with last night's bath water in a leaking can.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="8"> Now the bath tub is scratched, the carpet is wet and your right shoulder hurts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="9"> Surely there must be a better way for you and the garden to survive these greenhouse summers?</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="10"> There is.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="11"> In fact, there are three: Water less but better.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="12"> Catch and store rain water.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="13"> Recycle bath and sink water without using buckets.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="14"> All these solutions are simple.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="15"> All could contribute to more beautiful gardens and reduce water consumption.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="16"> A garden sprinkler uses as much water in 30 minutes as a family of four consumes in a day of eating, drinking, bathing and flushing.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="17"> This information comes from Thames Water, the company supplying water to much of London and surrounding areas.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="18"> Thames has joined the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew to produce a guide on how to quench a garden's thirst without wasting water or damaging the plants.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="19"> Kew has cut back drastically on its watering over the past few dry years, with no harmful effects to its collection.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="20"> These are its basic tips: Help the soil to retain moisture by digging-in bulky organic material such as manure or compost.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="21"> Mulch exposed soil with compost, manure, gravel or bark.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="22"> Water new plants thoroughly when planting.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="23"> Remove weeds regularly; they take moisture and nutrients from the soil.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="24"> Water thoroughly but infrequently - this encourages stronger growth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="25"> Ensure that plant species from dry climates are not over-watered.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="26"> Use rainwater to supplement the mains supply.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="27"> A modest house, or even a garden shed, can catch a surprising amount of water from the roof - around 12,000 gallons a year from a small house.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="28"> The easiest and cheapest way to store it is in a simple plastic butt, available from garden centres or by mail order for under Pounds 30.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="29"> None of these predominantly green tubs is pleasing aesthetically, but they can be hidden behind a climber or painted to camouflage their presence.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="30"> Some garden centres also stock large oak barrels which have been converted into butts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="31"> These cost around Pounds 80 and look a lot better than the plastic versions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="32"> They must never be allowed to dry out and should also get a yearly coat of oil or wood preservative.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="33"> Butts can be placed some distance away from the downpipe by using special attachments that connect to it and a length of hose.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="34"> Two of the most popular are the Rainmate (Pounds 19.95 from Agriframes) and the Rainmiser (Pounds 15.95 from Blackwall).</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="35"> Both are installed as an integral part of the downpipe, allowing water to flow to the tank but cutting it off when the butt is full.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="36"> A drawback is that a typical butt stores about 45 gallons, which is only a little more than a sprinkler could consume in about 30 minutes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="37"> A number can be joined by connecting the overflows, although a row of butts can look very unsightly.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="38"> If you have the space and the need, then it might be sensible to buy a big tank and bury it, say, under the lawn.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="39"> This might sound rather radical (and impossible for many town gardens); but as Britain's climate, especially in the southern part of England, becomes more Mediterranean, it might be prudent to do what Mediterraneans have been doing for centuries - storing water underground.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="40"> Once the hole has been covered and the lawn restored, the garden will benefit from a few thousand gallons of rain water stored prudently over the winter and extracted in the summer with a small electric pump.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="41"> Tank stockists are listed under horticultural and farmers' supplies in the Yellow Pages.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="42"> Prices for a 1,000-gallon tank run from about Pounds 300 (second-hand tanks are about a third of that) without installation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="43"> Expect to pay around Pounds 500 for the whole job.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="44"> Such tanks are especially useful if you want to store and recycle your bath and sink water - called grey water - by using it on the garden.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="45"> This water might not be suitable for drinking, but it is only slightly murky, and many plants appear to thrive on a little Fenjal or Fairy Liquid.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="46"> There are three main options for recycling grey water; all involve a reasonably intelligent plumber.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="47"> A simple solution is to instal a storage tank in the loft.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="48"> This is connected to a valve and pump which fills it automatically when you pull the plug.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="49"> The tank is connected to your hosepipe with pressure supplied by gravity.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="50"> Alternatively, an underground tank could be filled directly from the bath and sink and the water pumped through the hose when needed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="51"> It is essential to separate grey and rain water, using different tanks, and to use grey water quickly.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="52"> This is because it contains organic matter that will both spoil the fresh rain water (ideal for pot plants) and cause an unpleasant smell as it rots.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="53"> There is also a small risk of disease.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="54">. A more complicated solution is to purify your grey water.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="55"> While this is realistic only for very big gardens or hotels, the idea is quite simple and sensible.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="56"> Before being stored, grey water is filtered through sand or reed beds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="57"> Bacteria living on the roots of the reeds eat the organic matter in the water.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="58"> Such a purification system can be made a feature of the garden, disguised as a pond or fountain.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="59"> In the UK, there two bureaucratic problems may hinder potential water recyclers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="60"> Water companies claim they 'own' the grey water and that it is not necessarily ours to recycle.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="61"> Their main concern is that devious consumers will simply run the bath tap to fill their storage tanks during a hosepipe ban.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="62"> Also, environmental health officers might be concerned about a DIY water treatment works being set up in an urban area.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="63"> It would be wise to check with the authorities before spending.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="64"> Of course, there is a much simpler but more labour-intensive solution for re-using grey water.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="65"> Fit a hose connection to the bath drainage pipe before it joins the sewer.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="66"> Position your hose, or connect it to a seepage watering system, and yell for someone to pull the plug.</s>

<s docid="FT922-9059" num="67"> Mail-order suppliers: Blackwall Products (tel: 081-305-1431) sells water butts (made from recycled bulk fruit juice containers) and the Rainmiser.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="5"> By ALISON MAITLAND</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="6"> When Rhone-Poulenc, one of Europe's largest agrochemicals groups, started an experiment in organic farming at its research base in Essex, the public response was understandably sceptical.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="7"> Alongside laboratories testing 10,000 herbicide components a year was a project designed to demonstrate scientifically whether farming without chemicals could be profitable, effective and good for the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="8"> Five years into the experiment, Mr Lister Noble, manager of the 57-hectare Boarded Barns Farm, is as conscious as ever of the need for credibility as he unveils the first detailed conclusions of the 10-year comparison with conventionally-grown cereal crops.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="9"> 'If I haven't got my heart in it, then there's no comparison.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="10"> I do really want to make the organic side pay,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="11"> Driving round the site, Rhone-Poulenc's only commercial farm, Mr Noble bubbles with enthusiasm at the progress of the organic wheat and oats.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="12"> The land had to be left uncultivated for two years before organic cropping could begin, to remove all traces of chemicals.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="13"> So this year's grain harvest will be only the third, even though the project began in 1989.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="14"> 'This year is the first year that we're starting to see trends and drawing observations,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="15"> The organic crops appear less regimented and slightly less robust than their conventional rivals in five neighbouring fields on the farm, which has a predominantly chalky boulder clay soil topped by a medium-heavy loam.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="16"> However, Mr Noble says weeds have not been as big a problem as he feared.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="17"> Organic wheat production, although well below the conventional yield of about eight tonnes a hectare, was better than he expected.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="18"> 'I thought the first organic crop was going to be really weedy but it wasn't.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="19"> It yielded over five tonnes a hectare, which is rated with some of the best organic yields in the UK'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="20"> Second year yields were almost as good, but the protein level was too low to qualify the wheat for bread making.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="21"> Mr Noble attributes this to a lack of nitrogen in the soil.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="22"> H used pelleted chicken feather manure and seaweed extract to fertilise the soil in the first year but abandoned that in the second on the advice of some organic experts.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="23"> Now he is considering using it again to improve the quality - and saleability - of the wheat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="24"> Since one of the biggest difficulties with organic farming is low soil fertility, he is particularly pleased that new regulations from Brussels allow organic farmers to grow clover - a rich soil nutrient - on land they are paid to set aside from arable production.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="25"> This will prove an economical way of increasing nitrogen levels during rotations between cereal crops.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="26"> Every aspect of the project is being monitored by outside experts, ranging from university research departments to Adas, the government's farm advisory service, and the British Trust for Ornithology.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="27"> To demonstrate impartiality, Mr Noble asked Elm Farm, the research arm of the Soil Association, Britain's leading organic campaign body, to choose the five fields for the organic experiment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="28"> Independent experts have analysed and tasted bread made from the two types of wheat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="29"> They found no differences in the calorific value of the breads, although the organic wholemeal loaves did not rise as well and textures and flavours differed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="30"> As far as environmental effects are concerned, different species of spider have been found in the organic fields and more bird species on the farm generally, but it is too early to draw clear conclusions.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="31"> That is not the case when it comes to profitability.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="32"> The average annual cost of producing organic wheat at Boarded Barns Farm has been nearly Pounds 17 higher a tonne than for the conventional wheat over the past five years.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="33"> The project involved start-up costs for separate machinery such as a Pounds 14,000 sprayer to ensure no chemicals are sprayed by accident on to the organic crops.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="34"> In addition, loss of young crops to pests, disease and weeding machinery means that organic seed must be applied at 250kg a hectare, compared with 180kg on conventional fields.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="35"> However, the variable costs of the organic wheat crop in 1992 and 1993, such as seed, fertiliser, machinery and hired labour, proved lower than those of the conventional crop.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="36"> The really costly problem is having to leave fields uncropped during conversion to organic methods and again between crops, to restore soil fertility.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="37"> Mr Noble converted the fields gradually, keeping some under conventional crops for the first two years to boost gross margins.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="38"> 'The organic side would have looked pretty sick (financially) if we hadn't included the conventional crops,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="39"> Even so, the organic side of the farm has produced a cumulative gross margin -the value of output less variable costs - of only Pounds 2,557 a hectare since 1989 compared with Pounds 5,487 from the conventional side.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="40"> 'There's got to be a massive subsidy to make this farm pay, growing organic crops,' Mr Noble concludes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="41"> Britain, unlike other European countries such as Germany, does not pay state subsidies to existing organic farmers, although the government is implementing a Pounds 1.5m-a-year scheme in August to encourage conventional farmers to convert to organic.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="42"> Mr Noble himself favours 'taking the best of both (organic and conventional) systems'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="43"> He believes lessons can be learned by conventional farmers from the organic experiment, such as its use of a weeding machine which acts like a giant rake, lifting young weeds out of the soil before they have a chance to root firmly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="44"> This aerates the soil and loosens the surface, helping to release plant nutrients.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="45"> 'On a conventional farm, they could use this if there's not a high weed population.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="46"> If it doesn't work, they could then use a herbicide'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="47"> The experiment may continue beyond 10 years, Mr Noble says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="48"> 'We might find there's mileage in it'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="49"> Rhone-Poulenc has clearly seen which way the wind is blowing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="50"> It is developing agrochemicals with low active ingredients and pesticides that attack specific targets.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="51"> Another idea being pursued is for a protective dressing to be applied to seeds so that the crop they produce does not need to be sprayed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="52"> The group is also making diagnostic kits to help farmers decide the precise timing and levels of spray in environmentally sensitive areas.</s>

<s docid="FT943-15995" num="53"> According to Mr Noble: 'If the farmer wants to use fewer inputs, he will need quite a lot of advice and help.'</s>
