<s docid="FT933-16910" num="7"> NINE MEMBERS of the European Community agreed yesterday to abolish formal passport controls at all internal frontiers by December 1.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="8"> From that date, travellers between Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the Benelux countries will be able to pass freely across internal borders, including ports and airports.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="9"> Travellers from Britain, Ireland and Denmark will still be subject to the same immigration checks as other international travellers arriving in the free-travel zone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="10"> The deal, if it can be put into effect, will put pressure on Britain - which strongly opposes removing all passport checks - Ireland and Denmark to speed up their efforts to reduce controls.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="11"> Meeting in Madrid, ministers from the nine signatories of the Schengen free-travel accord agreed to give practical effect to the EC's aim of free movement of people.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="12"> Politically, it has proved the most sensitive aspect of the single European market, which already allows free movement of most goods, services and capital within the EC.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="13"> The Schengen group is named after the Luxembourg town where a regional agreement to open frontiers was reached in 1985.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="14"> Mr Carlos Westendorp, the Spanish EC affairs minister, who chaired yesterday's meeting, said the deal was 'good news for Europe at exactly the moment when we need some good news'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="15"> Yesterday's political declaration is subject, however, to conditions, insisted on by the new centre-right French government, which is still worried about the risks involved in allowing free movement of people.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="16"> In addition, certain large EC airports - including those serving Amsterdam and Brussels - will be given time to adapt their infrastructure to the new system, which will require splitting immigration and baggage-handling facilities for passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="17"> The delay means that some controls may be retained beyond December 1, even for travellers within the Schengen zone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16910" num="18"> A special Schengen committee will have to decide in October whether there has been sufficient progress in three key areas to justify opening all internal borders: improved checks on people coming from outside the free travel zone; action against drug trafficking; and the establishment of a Schengen information system, linking police and immigration authorities in the nine member states.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="15"> Schengen Agreements Inapplicable for One Year"] [Text] The Senate fact-finding mission formed 31 months ago to verify the conditions for the implementation of the Schengen agreement, which eliminates the internal borders and makes provision for the free movement of people and goods within the European Union, yesterday issued its final report concluding that the system is inapplicable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="16"> "This is our third postponement," Xavier de Villepin (centrist, representing expatriate French citizens), chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission, stressed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="17"> As the author of the mission's report, de Villepin reaffirmed that the free movement of people had originally been set for 1 January 1993 when the single market came into force, then it was postponed until October 1993 (Madrid Conference), until December 1993 (Paris summit), and again postponed until 1 February 1994, the date put forward as "an essential deadline".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="18"> Even before the Senate report was published, Bernd Schmidbauer, the German secretary of state to the Chancellery responsible for European questions, said yesterday morning that the elimination of identity checks at the borders of the nine European Union countries would have to be postponed again because it is "totally impossible on 1 February".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="19"> The implementation of this agreement is encountering one main difficulty: The establishment of the Schengen Information System (SIS), the joint computer facility which should make it possible for the Schengen signatory states (namely the Twelve minus Britain, Ireland, and Denmark) to consult police and legal data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="20"> Paul Masson (Rally for the Republic, Loiret), chairman of the Senate fact-finding mission, blames "the dilution of responsibility," the "bad choice of technicians" responsible for designing the SIS, the conditions in which the contract was awarded, and the loss of control over technical tests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="21"> "The current failure of the SIS results from a series of dysfunctions in the Schengen system without it being possible to identify a single culprit," the report stresses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="22"> "The failure is collective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="23"> It is grave, serious, and bitter, and it undermines the credibility of an entire organization....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="24"> It is the system as a whole which must be reviewed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="25"> The Senators' disappointment is particularly great because France has launched a complex process of adapting its Constitution (twice), its legislation (six laws passed), and its regulations to conform to the Schengen agreement.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="26"> Cornerstone</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="27"> The Senate mission also heard European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure on 11 January and he confirmed this assessment: "The internal legal provisions we have made in connection with the implementation of the Schengen convention will not be implemented on 1 February," the minister stressed, explaining that internal border controls and the police system would not be relaxed "until the Schengen convention is implemented".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="28"> In the view of Xavier de Villepin and Paul Masson, the delay in the implementation of the SIS cannot be made up in less than a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="29"> This computer network, costing 30 million francs (France contributed 26.8 percent of its financing), was designed badly from the start, and it is, in a way, "the cornerstone" of the Schengen agreement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59001" num="30"> The direct result of this is that all the joint policies drawn up in the Schengen framework (in the area of the right to asylum, the granting of visas, external border controls, airport equipment, combating illegal immigration, and drug trafficking) are blocked "for an indefinite period" creating "a major legal and technical vacuum".</s>

<s docid="FT932-16523" num="10"> They have now promised to lift all outstanding controls at land and sea borders by July and controls at airports by the end of December.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16523" num="15"> Mr Lamassoure also complained that currency instability had undermined the single market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="17"> No political meaning (which they do not have or, if at all, only very slightly) should be attributed to them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="18"> Once more, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="19"> Vanni d'Archirafi stressed what a difficult exercise this was, mainly because the member states do not all make the same interpretation of the former Article 8a (now Article 7a) on the abolition of controls on people at the borders of the Union.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="20"> Be this as it may, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="21"> Vanni d'Archirafi sees some "hopeful elements".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="22"> These mainly lie in the attitude of the German Chair of the Schengen Group (until end June), in the fact that "even Austria" has officially asked for observer status with the Schengen Group, and in indications according to which "it is not to be ruled out that the Danish position may develop along the same lines".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="23"> Furthermore, the Commissioner recalled that "at least 95 percent, if not 97 or 98 percent, of free movement has already been achieved".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="24"> Although some controls still exist (mainly because security problems have not been settled), the right of free movement is not disputed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="25"> He went on to say that the European Commission has proved its will to take concrete initiatives at the appropriate moment by proposing decisions concerning visas and the convention on external frontiers, and it plans to make other proposals in close sequence over coming months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="26"> Despite the above explanations, the judgment of MEPs [member of European Parliament] on the European Commission's attitude is very severe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="27"> If, by European elections in June, Schengen is not in force, then the European Commission will have failed on one of the most important questions, said German Christian Democrat Karl von Wogau for whom the present situation is a "scandal".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="28"> Mr. Jarzembowski, also German Christian Democrat, agreed that the "Commission has failed," and that the purely intergovernmental path which had been chosen also failed: European Union, he said, needs Community solutions, and the European Parliament is ready to contribute.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="29"> The MEP moreover encouraged Italy, Greece and Portugal to overcome the delays in the practical implementation of the Schengen Accord and those countries not able to accede to the Accord at least adopt security measures comparable to those planned for the Schengen countries, and insisted on the need for border controls to be lifted before the summer vacations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="30"> Belgian Socialist Mr. Van Outrive urged the Commission to be clear over the proposals concerning the third pillar of Maastricht.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="31"> Is it still of any use for the Commission to take part in work over Schengen? he wondered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="32"> Are you mocking us, Monsieur le Commissaire? asked the Dutch Liberal Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="33"> Wijsenbeek. You tell us you will make proposals, he complained, well that is your duty; you must act, otherwise you must go.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="34"> Would you be ready to refuse to show your passport and if necessary take the authorities who continue to control people at borders to court? asked Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="35"> Verhagen, Dutch Christian-Democrat.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="36"> You discredit yourself in claiming that free movement was 95 percent guaranteed, as its a `total lack of knowledge of reality,' said the French Liberal Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="37"> Delorozoy to the Commissioner (who repeated that free movement and control should not be confused).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="38"> As for Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="39"> Froment-Meurice, he spoke out against the "totally unfounded accusations" according to which France is alleged to be responsible for Schengen not functioning.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="40"> It is untrue, he said: The system did not work because the permanent working party (made up of directors for transmissions from the interior ministries of the eight Schengen countries) "had no pattern".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="41"> It is not even a question of intergovernmental, but of "infra-intergovernmental," the MEP noted, shouting, "for God's sake, let's no longer lock ourselves into the intergovernmental".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="42"> The European Commissioner tried to defend himself from the criticisms, notably by pointing out that the "accompanying measures" necessary to implement Schengen were not being applied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="43"> I make no promise as to dates, I never have, he added, but I hope in the coming months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-39341" num="44"> And he quoted the Italian writer Manzoni to defend his cautious approach, having one of his characters say "forward Pedro, but with wisdom".</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="7"> Travellers in continental Europe will not be able to cross borders without passports from next month as planned, nine European Union countries decided yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="8"> The nine members of the Schengen free-travel accord abandoned attempts to set a deadline for the abolition of passport controls, amid mutual recriminations about who was to blame for the latest and most serious delay.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="9"> Senior officials from the Schengen group of countries - all 12 EU members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - agreed yesterday their governments would not be able to meet the most recent target date of February 1 for ending passport controls.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="10"> They refused to set another deadline, as they could not predict when the Schengen zone's computer system - which is supposed to link up immigration and police authorities - would be running efficiently enough to replace border surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="11"> No solution is thought likely before the second half of the year.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="12"> Sema, the Anglo-French computing services group, angrily dismissed claims that the Strasbourg-based central computer was to blame for the delay.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="13"> Sema accused national governments of not bringing their computer systems into line.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="14"> A consortium of Sema, the French computer group Bull, and Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany has been working on Schengen's central system.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="15"> Members of the Schengen accord - named after the Luxembourg village where it was signed - originally intended to beat the EU's deadline of January 1 1993 for abolishing all controls at internal land, sea and airport frontiers.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="16"> Since then, they have missed three further deadlines.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="17"> Yesterday's decision leaves the EU's ambition to end internal passport controls in shreds.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="18"> The European Commission has pledged to enforce what it says is a legal obligation for all EU countries to lift controls, and faces legal action from the European Parliament for its alleged failure to press member states.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="19"> Agence France Presse reported yesterday that Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, state secretary at the German chancellery, had blamed Sema itself for failing to sort out system software problems.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="20"> Germany chairs the Schengen group until the end of June.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="21"> Sema officials said the central computer had been ready for testing on September 15, but some national systems were unprepared.</s>

<s docid="FT941-13450" num="22"> Schengen officials in Brussels said yesterday they expected to be ready to take a decision on passport controls 'at the end of the German presidency' of the Schengen group in June, but they stressed this was not a deadline.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="6"> DON'T throw away your passport.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="7"> For the EC traveller, the barrier-free European market has not quite arrived.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="8"> The lifting of frontier controls on goods and people was perhaps the most symbolic goal of the single market programme.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="9"> However, for six months or more it has been obvious that at least one, possibly three, and perhaps all 12 member states will not achieve the second of those objectives before the end of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="10"> Member states appear to have met the deadline for lifting frontier controls on goods.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="11"> For all its alleged faults, the new 'transitional' regime for VAT and excise duty has done away with the need for basic administrative border controls on all products.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="12"> Some 60m tax forms, and the people who used to fill them in, have gone too.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="13"> On the other hand, there are lingering doubts about how a new frontier-free regime will affect certain products.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="14"> In the case of bananas, for example, member states have just agreed a new quota regime, but it is unlikely to come into force for at least six months.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="15"> There is as yet no definitive system for monitoring the cross-border movement of works of art or of 'dual-use' goods, which have both military and civilian applications.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="16"> The most likely solution is a formal or informal 'cellule de crise' to deal with any problems which might occur between January 1 and the implementation of a new regime.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="17"> Officials agree it is little more than a sticking plaster solution, but it has allowed frontier controls on goods to be lifted before the January 1 deadline.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="18"> If member states keep their nerve - and do not allow the inevitable media scares about loopholes and errors to shake them into a hasty reimposition of controls - then free movement of goods seems more or less assured.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="19"> The abolition of passport controls presents quite different problems, which are unlikely to be resolved before the end of this year, if at all.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="20"> Nine months ago, the Community seemed to divide into three main camps on the question of passport checks.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="21"> Britain has always been the member state most vehemently opposed to the lifting of border controls on people and its government's argument is relatively simple.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="22"> The 1986 Single European Act, it says, does not oblige the UK to lift its controls on non-EC citizens.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="23"> Consequently, Britain must maintain at least a minimal check to ensure that unwanted non-EC travellers do not slip through the EC passport lane at ports and airports.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="24"> In the second camp are Denmark and Ireland.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="25"> Denmark wants to maintain border controls, but has indicated in the past it might be prepared to lift them if sufficient safeguards are put in place.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="26"> Ireland claims to be committed to the lifting of controls.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="27"> But because of its geographical proximity to Britain, and the fact that most of its travellers pass through the UK under an existing free-travel agreement, it would find it difficult to loosen its controls without at least consulting the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="28"> Finally, the European Commission and the remaining nine EC countries, which are members of the Schengen free-travel agreement, dispute the British interpretation of the Single European Act and are committed to the lifting of border controls on people.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="29"> Until recently, it looked as though the dispute between the Commission and the British government might end in the European Court.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="30"> An individual court case - perhaps brought by a federalist MEP or ordinary free-travel zealot - is still not out of the question, but in the past six to nine months, a number of new elements have reduced the immediate threat of Commission court action: Euro-politics.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="31"> Since the Danish and French referendums on the Maastricht treaty, Brussels has been increasingly reluctant to challenge member states on strongly held points of principle.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="32"> Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, warned fellow EC interior ministers in June that pressurising Britain on passport controls could swing the UK parliament against the Maastricht treaty - it was a potent argument, according to observers.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="33"> The refugee problem.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="34"> Increasing immigration pressures and racial tension, particularly in Germany, have made the Schengen nine think twice about lifting their internal border controls as quickly as they had intended.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="35"> The Schengen accord does commit them to abolish internal checks, but only when external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened, and ancillary measures - such as a computer link between Schengen immigration authorities -have been put in place.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="36"> Neither has yet happened.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="37"> Practical difficulties.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="38"> Airports - most notably the busy Schiphol hub in Amsterdam - have won a deferral of the deadline for lifting controls, on the grounds that they cannot physically change their infrastructure before December this year to separate EC and non-EC arrivals.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="39"> The result is that even the most enthusiastic countries are unlikely to lift their internal border controls on people before the middle of this year.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="40"> Travellers in continental Europe will probably notice little change - cars will still be able to sweep through most internal borders without checks; airports will still check passports, although controls may get lighter as terminal infrastructure is adapted to cope with the new regime.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="41"> Britain, on the other hand, is planning to retain its controls at airports and sea borders unaltered until Schengen decides to abolish its internal checks.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="42"> When that happens, UK seaports will probably implement a version of the so-called 'Bangemann wave' - named after the current internal market commissioner - requiring EC travellers to show the cover of their passport to officials.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="43"> Schengen's disarray on border controls let Britain off the hook as far as the January 1 deadline was concerned, but it seems unlikely that an eventual 'two-speed' solution to the question of passport checks will be acceptable to all continental European countries.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="44"> According to Schengen, the Bangemann wave is too strict as a control on internal borders and too lax as a control on external frontiers.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="45"> If Britain - or, indeed, Ireland and Denmark - decides to apply only minimal checks to travellers arriving from outside the Community then Schengen members may have to start examining the passports of passengers on flights and ferries from non-Schengen EC partners.</s>

<s docid="FT931-14276" num="46"> That would be a strange and unhappy end to a project that was supposed to be built on mutual trust and partnership.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="15"> at its meeting in Bonn on 26 April] [Text] The Executive Committee of the Schengen states, which met on 26 April 1994 under the chairmanship of Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer, adopted the following final communique: 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="16"> At its meeting in Bonn on 26 April 1994, the Executive Committee of the Schengen states discussed further measures to be taken in the gradual abolition of personal controls at internal borders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="17"> 2. The Executive Committee thereby reiterated its 14 December 1993 Paris declaration that all the legal and political conditions for the implementation of the Schengen Agreement were already in existence, and that an operational Schengen information system was the last remaining condition necessary for the final abolition of these borders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="18"> 3. For the purpose of abolishing personal controls at internal borders, the Executive Committee agreed on measures to be taken, especially the removal of traffic obstacles and lifting of traffic restrictions at border crossing points; a plan of such measures was adopted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="19"> The implementation of this plan is the responsibility of each individual Schengen state, and depends on the functioning of the Schengen information system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="20"> 4. The participating countries reiterated their firm desire to complete the work on the Schengen information system as quickly as possible by means of close and trustworthy cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="21"> For this purpose, project management should be improved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="22"> A crisis staff has already been appointed, which has assumed overall technical responsibility until the Schengen information system becomes operational.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="23"> 5. A further condition for the setting in motion of the Schengen information system is the successful conclusion of a series of tests, which are also meant to locate and remove the last remaining technical faults.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="24"> In order to accelerate this process, the participating countries have decided to create a third data bank, in order to expand the test capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="25"> 6. The Executive Committee acknowledged the report on the Schengen information system produced by independent experts, and will in the short term present recommendations for improvements on the basis of this report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="26"> During final tests on the functioning of this system, it will be considered what type of service structure to introduce.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="27"> 7. At the same time, the Executive Committee established that the operational readiness of the Schengen information system would be the starting signal for the abolition of personal controls at the internal borders as soon as the relevant personal data has been stored in the system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="28"> 8. The participating countries place themselves under an obligation to adapt their national information systems to the central information system in Strasbourg, so that a trouble-free transfer of data can occur.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="29"> The consortium of firms led by SEMA has also promised its full support for the remaining phases of the project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="30"> 9. A further condition -- the naming by each participating country of the bodies authorized to call up data in accordance with Article 1001 of the Schengen Agreement -- has been fulfilled in the meantime.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="31"> The Executive Committee will be able formally to acknowledge the list of these bodies in accordance with Article 101, Paragraph 4 of the agreement after final details have been clarified and after the Joint Provisional Control Committee has declared its approval.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="32"> Access to this data by the consumers given in the list is the sole responsibility of the individual participating country, and will be reported to the Executive Committee immediately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="33"> 10. The Executive Committee acknowledged the opinions of the Joint Provisional Control Committee whereby the security conditions for loading and operating the Schengen information system in the original Schengen signatory countries France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and in the subsequent member countries Spain and Portugal, are in existence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="34"> 11. The Executive Committee also acknowledged that work on Schengen regulations on the basis of the working program of the German chairmanship would be continued.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="35"> The already adopted regulation concerning unified visa issuance procedures has been supplemented by an additional regulation concerning the issuance of visas at borders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="36"> 12. In addition, a protocol was signed whereby the provisions of the Schengen Agreement concerning the granting of political asylum will be replaced by the relevant provisions of the Dublin Agreement once the latter agreement has entered into effect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="37"> Thus, the Schengen participating countries displayed yet again their status as a pattern and example for the European Union.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="38"> 13. The Executive Committee adopted an interim report on the state of talks on Austria's observer status.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="39"> All participating countries support a rapid granting of observer status to Austria.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="40"> The Executive Committee called on the chairman to continue negotiations with Austria, so that the granting of observer status to that country can be decided at the next Executive Committee meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-64577" num="41"> 14. The Executive Committee will hold its next meeting in Berlin on 27 June 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="16"> Schengen Measures Until Latter Half of Year"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] [Text] Brussels, 14 Jan (BELGA) -- The implementation of the Schengen accords (Benelux, France, Germany) on exempting travelers from controls at stations, ports, and airports is unlikely to take effect before next July.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="17"> Belgian aviation circles (Sabena, BATC, aviation authorities) and the European Affairs Ministry (office of Robert Urbain) expect this further delay following the postponement of deadlines set previously (1 November 1993 and 1 February 1994).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="18"> The software of the central computer (in Strasbourg) containing vital programs for identification, formalities, and other control operations linked to the application of Schengen are apparently not yet perfected and do not permit a normal functioning of equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="19"> The decision has therefore been made in principle to postpone once again the application of the accords.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="20"> But it is not until a meeting of the relevant European ministers -- scheduled for February -- that a decision may be made on the exact date for implementing the accords.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="21"> It seems this date will be in the second half of 1994, according to a spokesman for Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="22"> Urbain. A Sabena spokesman believes the application of Schengen is now likely to be very close to the date for the final opening (next November) of the new Brussels-National air terminal, which would simplify the problem of making provisional arrangements in the old airport terminal to separate the flow of passengers coming from or going to the five Schengen countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="23"> If there remains just a short period between the new date of entry into force of Schengen and the opening of the Brussels airport terminal, the aviation authorities believe a pragmatic solution could certainly be found, making it possible to apply the provisions of the accord (almost total elimination of the risk of fraud, and in particular the exchange of travel documents between Schengen and non-Schengen passengers) to a sufficiently effective degree for a few months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59008" num="24"> The Schengen accord is soon to be extended to include Portugal and -- in subsequent stages -- Greece and Spain, and finally the British Isles and Denmark.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="6"> The row over the most recent delay in implementing the computer system underpinning the Schengen free-travel accord reeks of deja vu to those involved in sophisticated information technology projects.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="7"> The technology is rarely at fault; the management usually has a lot to answer for.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="8"> In this case the failure to appoint a prime contractor has led to an acrimonious squabble over responsibility for coordination of the project.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="9"> The row is over the failure of the nine European Union signatories of the Schengen accord to meet a February 1 target for ending passport controls.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="10"> The Schengen system is simple in essence.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="11"> A central computer in Strasbourg holds police and immigration records.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="12"> Officials in the nine member countries of the Schengen accord - the UK, Denmark and Ireland have excluded themselves - have access to the information over telecommunications links.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="13"> The technology is tried and tested.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="14"> Siemens Nixdorf, the German computer manufacturer, is initially providing one, then a pair of mainframe computers to manage the central records.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="15"> Bull, the French computer manufacturer, is providing the telecommunications infrastructure, and Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, is developing the applications software.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="16"> It also takes overall responsibility for the system.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="17"> Each of the nine countries has responsibility for developing its own system, linking police and immigration authorities, and ensuring it is ready for connection to Strasbourg.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="18"> It is not much of a challenge by modern computing standards, yet the system has been delayed repeatedly and now is certain to miss the most recent target date of February 1 for ending passport controls.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="19"> If the present rate of progress is maintained, it could be 12 months before the system is ready.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="20"> Even when the links are established, each national system will have to be thoroughly tested.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="21"> What has gone wrong and, more important, why?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="22"> Everybody agrees the central system is in good shape and has been for some months.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="23"> The problem is that the essential links between the central system and the national systems are not all ready.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="24"> Until the links are in place, system testing is impossible.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="25"> At least three national systems must be connected if the system is to be tested realistically.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="26"> So far Belgium and the Netherlands have their links in place; France is expected to follow.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="27"> Germany, however, is not ready to connect.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="28"> Who is at fault?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="29"> The Schengen authorities yesterday blamed Sema, arguing that it was contractually obliged to provide the linking software.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="30"> Sema rejected the criticism.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="31"> Europe still seems to have some lessons to learn in project management.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12878" num="32"> Schengen is not an episode to promote confidence that the EU can co-ordinate its efforts to create information superhighways or other large information technology systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="15"> [Interview with European Minister Alain Lamassoure by Alain</s>
</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="16"> Dauvergne; place and date not given: "Europe Falls Victim to Information Technology"] [Text] 1994: Europe will once again be at the center of political life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="17"> Due to the European elections in June.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="18"> And to a further enlargement, which implicates its future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="19"> Alain Lamassoure, European affairs minister, explains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="20"> [Dauvergne] In seeking to conclude at any price the accession negotiations for Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden by March, is there not a danger of sacrificing the fundamentals in order to meet the deadlines ? [Lamassoure] The logic is rather similar to that of the GATT talks: A date has been set which is a political objective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="21"> I do not consider that we are being unrealistic: We have two months left in order to settle matters with four countries, whereas in the case of the GATT we overcame very difficult problems between 16 countries in just one month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="22"> This time France has three objectives: - A good agreement by the date set -- and we will not make a problem of the maintenance of national traditions such as the consumption of sucking tobacco (snus) in Sweden; - The retention of what the Community has already acquired: We will be particularly firm on foreign and security policy (PESC).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="23"> Notably with respect to three countries which have neutral status.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="24"> They have just given a commitment to make the necessary changes -- which involves legislative or even constitutional changes; - Finally, we want to solve the bilateral problems which remain with some of them by that date.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="25"> [Dauvergne] For example?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="26"> [Lamassoure] We have a problem with Austria over Grundig [manufacture of audiovisual equipment]: This company closed its factory in Cretzwald, in Moselle, to transfer its activities to Austria, thanks to Austrian state aid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="27"> We have asked for the refund of 70 percent of this aid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="28"> Vienna has refused.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="29"> Last week we therefore reintroduced customs duty on products manufactured in Austria by Grundig.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="30"> Another dispute -- on a larger scale this time -- is between France and Finland in the sawlogs and paper sectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="31"> Due to the 35 percent devaluation of the Finnish markka (between 1991 and the end of 1992), we recorded a strong increase in wood imports in 1992 (followed by a further increase of 6 percent in 1993).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="32"> We are now suddenly faced with a situation of one sawmill closing every day in France.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="33"> These are small firms, but all the same.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="34"> In the paper sector, we have seen prices collapse and some large French companies are on the verge of bankruptcy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="35"> We have decided to closely monitor imports from Finland.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="36"> At the same time, experts from both countries are going to get together to work out an acceptable solution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="37"> [Dauvergne] Is this a precondition for the accession agreement?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="38"> [Lamassoure] That is not what I am saying.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="39"> But we do want any bilateral problems to be settled so that negotiations, and then ratifications, can be completed under the very best conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="40"> [Dauvergne] After several delays, the Schengen accords -- which will finally permit the free movement of citizens between nine European countries -- are set to enter into force on 1 February.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="41"> You announced it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="42"> Is this deadline going to be met?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="43"> [Lamassoure] It is not certain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="44"> We have overcome all the problems relating to external border controls and the fight against drug trafficking.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="45"> The political and legal problems have therefore been solved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="46"> But a technical problem remains: the functioning of the data processing system (charged to Sema, Siemens and Bull).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="47"> We have appointed two experts -- one French and one German -- who will be submitting their final report in early January.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="48"> We need to find out what is at the origin of these difficulties -- which are affecting certain software programs -- and what can be done to correct them as soon as possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="49"> Later, we must look at the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the contract and the selection of this group.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="50"> But in the meantime it is unlikely that the deadline of 1 February will be respected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="51"> [Dauvergne] Would it not save time -- these technical hitches have been creating problems for months now -- if we simplified the system which was initially planned ? [Lamassoure] The system as planned -- a central computer file linked to national files -- is no doubt too complicated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="52"> But, unfortunately, that is the system laid down in the Schengen Treaty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="53"> A different system would mean changing the treaty and therefore starting the process of ratification all over again.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="54"> You can imagine how long that would take!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="55"> [Dauvergne] You defend the principle of a single list of candidates representing the majority coalition at the European elections.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="56"> But there is a huge gap between your view of Europe and that held by Philippe Seguin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="57"> [Lamassoure] We are in the process of setting down in black and white the proposals of all concerned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="58"> The UDF [Union for French Democracy] has in fact already published a document and the RPR [Rally for the Republic] is working on one.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="59"> Subsequently, the leaders of both parties will see if they can arrive at a common platform, as they did at the time of the last European elections in 1989 and the last legislative elections where a chapter of our program was devoted to Europe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="60"> [Dauvergne] But the government's European project is not very clear for the moment....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="61"> [Lamassoure] The government's policy has consisted of adopting -- on each subject -- the most European position.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="62"> This is true of the GATT -- and God knows how many people advised us to adopt different positions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="63"> And it is true for foreign and security policy: It is France and the present government which is defending the role of the WEU [Western European Union] in relation to the Atlantic Alliance, and which wants to see the European defense identity recognized at the NATO summit on 10 January in Brussels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="64"> As to the reform of the institutions of the European Union, that is not a matter for the present government as it is planned for 1996.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="65"> We simply ask that the next enlargement which is set for 1995 should not be allowed to compromise the proper functioning of the Community.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="66"> We therefore want the number of votes required to obtain a blocking minority at the Council of Ministers to be increased from 23 -- the present figure in the Community of Twelve -- to 27 when we become the Community of Sixteen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-57961" num="67"> This is a very important point on which the British, for the moment, disagree.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="6"> THE border post on the bridge over the Moselle river at Schengen is locked, but is not yet empty.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="7"> Inside, Mr Rene Zimmer, the Luxembourg village's last customs and immigration chief, is poring over the new European Community VAT regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="8"> These are the rules which in a few days should open the frontier and close the border post for good, sending Mr Zimmer, 57, to a well-earned pre-retirement posting in Esch-sur-Alzette, further west.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="9"> Mr Zimmer is pleased.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="10"> He has spent 17 of the last 25 years manning the frontier with Germany and France, but he is not a Schengen man.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="11"> Esch-sur-Alzette is closer to his home.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="12"> In the Cafe International, however, opposite the bridge, proprietor Ernest Schemel, 73, his son Guy and a handful of Schengen's 350 locals believe the single market will bring trouble.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="13"> They see more crime, more bureaucracy, more uncertainty and, at worst, redundancy for those villagers who for years have made their living from the frontier.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="14"> That Schengen, squeezed into the south-eastern corner of Luxembourg, should fear the lifting of border controls is ironic.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="15"> It was at Schengen - or, more accurately, in a boat moored beneath the bridge - that France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the Schengen agreement in June 1990 which was supposed to herald the barrier-free Community.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="16"> The five countries, now swollen to nine, committed themselves to moving ahead of the rest of the EC by lifting controls on people by January 1 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="17"> Only Britain, Denmark and Ireland have not signed.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="18"> The agreement has already taken effect in Schengen itself.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="19"> Regular frontier controls on the Luxembourg side of the Moselle disappeared earlier this year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="20"> In Germany and France a handful of uniformed officials are still carrying out desultory checks.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="21"> Villagers are not nostalgic about the old days of border controls.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="22"> They are hard-headed enough to realise that change is inevitable.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="23"> But the concerns of those who benefit from Schengen's privileged border status are easy to understand.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="24"> At weekends it is difficult to cross the main street for queues of German and French cars.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="25"> The visitors do not come to Schengen principally for its pretty chateau and church, or even for its vineyards, sweeping down to the river from the steep hills above the village.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="26"> They come for its half dozen petrol stations, all of them exploiting the excise loophole which means that fuel is LFr10 (19 pence) a litre cheaper here.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="27"> Alcohol and cigarettes are also a better buy in Luxembourg.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="28"> As it turns out Schengen has little to fear from the immediate impact of single-market tax harmonisation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="29"> Under the indirect tax deal done with its EC partners, the Grand Duchy will guard most of its excise advantages at least until 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="30"> Mr Ernest Legill, the village's echevin, or local councillor, and a wine-grower like most inhabitants, is generally optimistic about what will happen after January 1.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="31"> But like many older villagers he cannot disguise a visceral unease about the lifting of borders.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="32"> He remembers the second world war, when the Schengen bridge was one of the first to be destroyed as the Germans advanced west.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="33"> Similar concerns are voiced less diplomatically in the Cafe International over glasses of the local white wine.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="34"> A local haulier, preferring to remain anonymous, points out that now there are fewer customs and immigrations officials on the bridge, the number of burglaries in the village has increased.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="35"> Mr Schemel and his family also fear the loss of their livelihood.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="36"> Since 1959 they have worked as customs agents - employed by exporters and importers to deal with tax forms at borders.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="37"> Those forms should disappear on December 31, replaced by an electronic system.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="38"> But Schengen is where the smooth-running computerised dream of a thousand EC tax officials breaks down.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="39"> Local pessimism reflects wider gloom about the goal of open frontiers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="40"> Growing evidence suggests that companies across the EC are not ready for the complex new VAT system.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="41"> Even the ideals of the Schengen accord have soured in the last few months.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="42"> Ministers from the nine countries met in Madrid this week and agreed on a common visa for the free-travel area.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="43"> But their January deadline for completely open borders has slipped at least until the middle of the year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="44"> Passport checks are likely to remain in place well beyond that date in the UK, Denmark and Ireland.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1015" num="45"> Such sluggishness will not prevent Mr Zimmer clearing his office on December 31 and leaving the Schengen border crossing unmanned for probably the first time since the Grand Duchy came into being in 1839.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="16"> for foreign affairs, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Flimsy Computer Excuse for French Political Obstinacy"] [Text] Perhaps it is the fact that he is resigning that makes the state secretary so forthright, or maybe it is a runup to an extremely critical position as a member of the European Parliament.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="17"> Whatever the case, when it comes to Schengen, Piet Dankert does not mince his words.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="18"> "This is a tragedy," he said, "an ongoing tragedy".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="19"> [ELSEVIER] So is Schengen synonymous with the failures of European integration?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="20"> [Dankert] I feel it is a matter of official sabotage of a political decision.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="21"> [ELSEVIER] What do you mean?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="22"> [Dankert] I have the strong impression that the French Interior Ministry has done its utmost to hinder the treaty from being implemented, and so far, it must be said, with a reasonable degree of success.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="23"> [ELSEVIER] Do you have an example of this?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="24"> [Dankert] Take, for example, the central computer of the Schengen Information System, which is under French control.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="25"> Irrespective of the fact that the thing is useless, it has been shut down for five weeks because of a wrong command.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="26"> Imagine that, a computer out of action for five weeks because of a wrong command!</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="27"> Have you ever heard of anything like that in industry?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="28"> [ELSEVIER] So what is wrong with the computer?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="29"> [Dankert] The system's national computers work perfectly, both from and to the central computer in the heavily guarded building in Strasbourg.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="30"> However, we were told that problems are created when data from one country have to be transmitted via the central computer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="31"> As far back as the ministerial meeting in Rome two years ago, we already objected that the French-German lobby did not choose the number one tender for a central computer, but the number two.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="32"> Number one was a reputable U.S. company, which, incidentally, was headquartered in France.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="33"> However, the French wanted the software to be supplied by a French state-owned company.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="34"> History has taught us that we were right to object.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="35"> Even the French are now saying that the software is useless.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="36"> But there is more.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="37"> We are dealing with a French state-owned company in which the French Government has a direct interest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="38"> The continued existence of this company is dependent on further government assignments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="39"> [ELSEVIER] You are suggesting that the French Government is purposely letting things drag on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="40"> [Danker] I can note that at official level there has never been a constructive spirit to let the Schengen Information System function.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="41"> Nor has there been such a spirit at the level of the Interior Ministries, neither under the past government, nor under the current government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="42"> Indeed, it was up to the French Foreign Ministry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="43"> This is related to the creation of Schengen as part of the European process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="44"> However, the Interior Ministry had a great deal of trouble looking over the border.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="45"> Interior Ministries generally have problems doing that, but the French department is a case apart.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="46"> [ELSEVIER] Do you mean that the French have ulterior motives for stopping Schengen?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="47"> [Dankert] In recent years, the French have set a number of conditions, but at the talks last June in Madrid most of them were met.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="48"> Only checks at external borders and Netherlands drug policy remain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="49"> Following further agreements, the French said in December: Things are going well.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="50"> That message came from my French colleague Lamassoure at the Foreign Ministry, and it concerned Schengen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="51"> However, later we started noticing that they are not all that pleased, especially about the sale of hashish to foreigners in coffee shops.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="52"> In addition, the French still view Germany's eastern border as a problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="53"> There are too many migrants coming through it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="54"> The Germans have already set up an extra 3,000 policemen there, but you will never make it watertight.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="55"> Otherwise you have to start shooting, but that must not be our aim.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="56"> [ELSEVIER] So it is not really about the computer?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="57"> [Dankert] Perhaps in part, but I think that the computer is mainly an excuse for political obstinacy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="58"> [ELSEVIER] What is going to happen now in Berlin?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="59"> Is it time to pound the fist on the table?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="60"> [Dankert] We will get some insight into whether or not the problem with the computer is really a technical problem, or just an example of official or political sabotage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="61"> A crisis team has now been set up, but we are helpless because that thing is under the control of the French Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="62"> My hope lies with the Germans, who are also fed up with it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="63"> I expect that they have sufficient political authority to raise a fist to the French.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="64"> And if it should turn out that something really is wrong with the computer, then in Berlin we have to take the plunge and simply decide to set up another one.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="65"> It is a scandal that this has lasted so long.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44278" num="66"> This undermines European integration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="24"> Balladur, Chirac Presidential Candidacies Viewed [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR 13-19 Jan, etc]</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="25"> [Editorial report] Writing in the 13-19 January Paris left-of-center weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Alain Duhamel notes that it is presently "fashionable" to question the durability of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's "ascendancy," as well as the influence he can exert on the political scene until the presidential elections.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="26"> While Balladur's popularity has a solid foundation, it will naturally suffer some attrition but will not collapse, for it rests, above all, on a "judgment of the man, his style, and the political equilibrium he represents," Duhamel comments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="27"> Much depends on the general situation, he adds: Were the government to fail in its attempt to stabilize unemployment and improve economic growth, and if pessimism gained, leading to serious social conflict, Balladur's popularity would wane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="28"> On the other hand, if the prime minister succeeds in imposing a unified list of Rally for the Republic [RPR]-Union for French Democracy [UDF] candidates for the Euroelections and in keeping his ministers out of the competition, he will continue to embody the role of unifier of the parliamentary right, Duhamel continues.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="29"> Much also depends on the evolution of his relationship with RPR leader Jacques Chirac.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="30"> While the French are grateful to Balladur for ending the rivalry between Chirac and UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the prime minister should carefully avoid a "fratricidal Balladur-Chirac duel".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="31"> In Duhamel's estimation, this might not be easy, since all polls reveal the prime minister is the favorite for president.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="32"> Indeed, Balladur would leave all his opponents--from the right or from the left--far behind in the first round and would win handily against any adversary in the second.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="33"> While Balladur stated before becoming prime minister that the future head of government in a cohabitation period should never run for president, he could not have imagined the extent of his popularity at that time, Duhamel comments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="34"> Balladur would only enter the race if Chirac were in a difficult position, Duhamel contends; and there will certainly be only one RPR candidate, he affirms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="35"> The issue will probably be settled after the European Parliament elections: If the situation remains unchanged, the prime minister would be better placed than Chirac, and thus the "Balladur phenomenon" will surely upset the political scene.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="36"> Under different, more difficult circumstances that would negatively affect the government, Chirac might recoup, at which time Balladur's "courteous authority" would only have been a transition between the legislative and the presidential timetables, Duhamel concludes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="37"> By taking himself out of the race for the Euroelections on 21 January, Chirac "opened the hostilities" with Balladur, notes Gilles Bresson in the 24 January Paris daily LIBERATION.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="38"> "The war is scheduled for June," Bresson continues, when an early RPR congress will proclaim its leader an official presidential candidate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="39"> Chirac's move stemmed partially from the opposition of some of his close aides--notably Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe--against his heading the Euroelection list of candidates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="40"> It is thus not surprising that Chirac's preferred candidate at this time is Juppe, for he has the advantage of upsetting Balladur who rejected a Euroelection candidacy for the members of his cabinet, Bresson contends.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="41"> In addition, relations between Juppe and the prime minister "brutally" deteriorated during the GATT negotiations when Juppe demanded from an unhappy Balladur written directives to negotiate--an idea suggested by Chirac--and was offended because the prime minister congratulated Jacques Delors and Leon Brittan but neglected him.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="42"> Finally, Bresson notes, Balladur did not appreciate the fact that Juppe affirmed to the press his attachment to a Chirac presidential candidacy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="43"> The 5 January Paris satirical weekly LE CANARD ENCHAINE notes UDF-inspired rumors claiming that the presidential election might be held earlier than scheduled.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="44"> Besides Giscard's "enthusiastic" participation in this "campaign," the newspaper cites Minister of Defense Francois Leotard as openly expressing his belief that "Mitterrand will not end his term" and that "Balladur knows it and is preparing himself".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="45"> The paper further quotes Leotard as saying that "this is precisely why I made my position in his favor so clear.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="46"> Not only did the prime minister not reprimand me, but, on the contrary, he was very happy".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="47"> LE CANARD also quotes Minister of Overseas Territories Dominique Perben as stating to the press that "Chirac is caught up in an implacable mechanism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="48"> He will be unable to run for president.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="49"> It is Balladur who will".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-38434" num="50"> The paper comments that since Perben, a former deputy secretary general of the RPR, owes his political career to the RPR leader: "the Chirac boat must indeed be sinking: run for your life"!</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="7"> MINISTERS of the nine European Community signatories to the Schengen free travel pact yesterday agreed to delay removing systematic passport checks until February 1, chiefly because of technical problems on a police computer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="8"> Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EC affairs minister, who chaired the meeting in Paris, played down the two-month delay from the December 1 deadline which the Schengen signatories set earlier this year for ending routine controls on people travelling between their countries.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="9"> 'February 1 is virtually tomorrow, and there is nothing to stop preparatory measures coming into effect on December 1,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14160" num="10"> But the minister admitted that internal French problems over political asylum were another cause for delay.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="7"> MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary, sounds more than usually smug these days.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="8"> 'There's no member state actually proposing to remove all its frontier controls (on people) during 1993,' he said after Monday's meeting of EC interior minister - their last gathering before the single market deadline of January 1.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="9"> For Britain, which has always opposed lifting controls on people, the unwillingness or inability of more enthusiastic countries to abolish passport checks is a relief.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="10"> It reduces the risk of embarrassment on December 31, when, as president of the EC, the UK will be duty-bound to declare the single market open.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="11"> Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner, has long since shelved threats of legal action against countries which retain controls.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="12"> There is still nothing to stop federalist MEPs or free-travel zealots taking the UK to the European Court for retaining passport checks and breaking EC rules on free movement of people - but Britain claims it will not be alone in the dock.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="13"> The nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all the EC countries except the UK, Denmark and Ireland - are unlikely to abolish their controls before the middle of next year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="14"> They are worried because agreements to strengthen external EC frontiers are not yet in place, and their own information system - linking immigration authorities - is not ready.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="15"> EC airports, which have to rebuild terminals to separate international and EC flight arrivals, have been given until December 1993 to get ready for the new regime.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="16"> Denmark and Ireland, for different reasons, will retain checks at borders at least until the continental EC countries have completed their free-travel zone, if not longer.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="17"> So as far as passport controls are concerned, what will change on January 1?</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="18"> The short answer is nothing.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="19"> In practice, travellers across most land borders on continental Europe will not have their passports checked; air travellers will.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="20"> British controls at air and sea borders will be unaltered.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="21"> A two- or three-speed Europe, in which passport controls are lifted only gradually, seems inevitable.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="22"> But Mr Clarke's intransigence has still angered Britain's EC partners.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="23"> At Monday's meeting, he refused to endorse a compromise proposal which would have pledged EC countries to remove 'systematic' border checks during 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="24"> Afterwards he said there would be no point in talking about border controls again until other member states had made further progress.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="25"> They point out that Mr Clarke's claim that nobody is ready to lift controls obscures one basic difference between Schengen and Britain.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="26"> Schengen countries are still determined to abolish passport checks.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="27"> But the most Britain will do is move to a minimal system of controls on EC travellers at sea-ports, which would still be unacceptable to the Schengen countries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="28"> For all Mr Clarke's smugness, it is clear that the question of border controls has only been delayed, not solved.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="29"> Plans for EC-wide co-ordination of the fight against drug trafficking were blocked yesterday by a dispute between interior ministers about where a European drugs unit should be located.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4549" num="30"> The ministers, meeting in London, decided to pass the issue on to the Edinburgh summit.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="7"> The European Union's attempt to end passport controls at internal borders has been 'a catalogue of broken promises', according to a Europe-wide citizens' lobby group.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="8"> Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas) yesterday condemned the European Commission and EU member states for failing to abolish checks at internal borders, a year after the original deadline of January 1, 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="9"> Since then, the nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all EU countries except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - have set and missed two further deadlines and are now aiming to abolish passport checks on February 1.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="10"> But Mr Tony Venables, who heads Ecas, yesterday cast doubt on the countries' ability to meet the new deadline.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="14"> Ecas received more than 700 calls, letters and fax messages about border controls when it ran a similar hotline last January.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="15"> The European parliament has already lodged a complaint against the Commission with the European court, accusing Brussels of failing to enforce EU rules on free movement of people.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="16"> Ecas yesterday threatened to open a second case.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="17"> Siemens and Bull, the German and French electronics groups, have been working on the Schengen computer system for two years, but they have yet to iron out all the software problems.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16995" num="18"> Schengen experts will meet in Brussels on January 25 to decide whether the February 1 deadline can be met.</s>

<s docid="FT924-6931" num="16"> 'What I need is a declaration that these regular controls will not be exercised (after January 1 1993) and a practical situation demonstrating willingness not to exercise them,' he said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="9"> Addressing members of the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, set a new deadline of the end of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="10"> He said it would be counterproductive to take legal action against individual member states immediately.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="11"> He also said legislation alone would be insufficient to abolish controls.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="12"> But he emphasised that Brussels would take action if member states failed to remove passport checks at land and sea borders by July, and at airports by December.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="13"> Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he had been encouraged by progress made by all 12 member states in opening borders during the first three months of this year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="14"> The nine members of the Schengen free travel agreement are not yet satisfied that checks at external EC frontiers are strong enough to allow internal controls to be eased.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="15"> The Schengen convention still has to be ratified by Germany and Greece, but Mr Vanni d'Archirafi said he hoped Germany at least would ratify by early July.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="16"> The commissioner said yesterday that if there was a clear political will to lift border controls, he would not accept technical excuses for delaying the removal of passport checks.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="17"> He is likely to have greater difficulty persuading Britain to abandon passport checks.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="18"> The UK disputes the Commission's interpretation that controls must be lifted on all travellers within the Community, and says the rules apply only to EC travellers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-17156" num="19"> Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, who favours a non-confrontational approach, said he had been encouraged by the gradual introduction of what he called the 'blue wave' - a system by which EC citizens simply show the cover of their passports at internal borders.</s>
