<s docid="FT943-543" num="6"> Officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia yesterday began investigating the cause of Europe's worst maritime disaster since the second world war amid reports that water flooding in through the bow doors caused the ferry Estonia to capsize.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="7"> More than 800 lives were lost when the 21,794 tonne ferry, sailing from the Estonian capital Tallinn to Stockholm, sank within minutes early yesterday morning in the Baltic Sea 40km south west of the Finnish island of Uto.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="8"> There were 964 passengers and crew aboard, and a full cargo of cars and heavy trucks.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="9"> The sinking of the Estonia is expected to lead to renewed calls for improvements to ferry safety despite recent international efforts to raise standards.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="10"> Roll-on roll-off ferries present particular problems because of their large open car and truck decks.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="11"> These lack dividing bulkheads, which give extra protection against capsizing to other vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="12"> The world's shipping nations agreed on tougher rules governing the stability of ships in 1990, although Britain, Sweden and eight other European nations have agreed higher standards which take effect on October 1.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="13"> Last night, Mr Raimo Tiilikainen, the leader of the Finnish rescue operation, said teams of helicopters and ships had rescued 141 people and recovered 42 bodies.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="14"> But he said 781 people were missing and officials said there was little hope of finding anyone alive in the cold Baltic waters.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="15"> Estline, the joint Swedish-Estonian operator of the ship, said it could not explain the sudden capsize and sinking.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="16"> It said the last radio message from the bridge reported the engines had failed and the ship was listing badly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="17"> However, a member of the crew, Mr Henrik Sillaste, said he saw water burst into the car deck past the bow loading ramp shortly before the vessel foundered.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="18"> 'On the TV monitor in the machine room, we could see water rushing in on the car deck,' he told reporters.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="19"> Two Swedish maritime inspectors who saw the vessel in Tallinn on Tuesday said the rubber seals around the bow doors were partly damaged, but not to a dangerous degree.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="20"> They were quoted as saying: 'We saw ageing and worn-out lashings and seals which had been damaged.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="21"> But none of the faults was so big it could have caused the disaster'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="22"> The 14-year old German built vessel was regarded as being well designed to deal with tough conditions in the Baltic Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="23"> The speculation that the disaster was caused by water coming in through the bow doors raised alarming comparisons with the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="24"> The Herald capsized with the loss of 189 lives after the bow doors had not been closed properly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="25"> Some 500 of the Estonia's missing and dead were Swedes and most of the rest were Estonians.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="26"> Both countries declared a national state of mourning.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="27"> The Estonia began sailing between Stockholm and Tallinn in February 1993 for Estline, a company jointly owned by the state-owned Estonian Shipping Company and Sweden's Nordstrom & Thulin.</s>

<s docid="FT943-543" num="28"> It was reported to have been insured for Pounds 38m, about half of this through the London marine market.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="7"> News of the Estonia ferry disaster yesterday instilled a deep sense of shock across Sweden, a country unaccustomed to such a jolting catastrophe.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="8"> 'Nothing like this has ever happened to us before,' said a journalist on a leading newspaper.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="9"> 'We have not been involved in the great wars of this century, we have not suffered from natural disasters.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="10"> We have not even lost one of our soldiers in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="11"> It will take a long time for the country to get over this'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="12"> Both Mr Carl Bildt, the outgoing prime minister and his successor, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, described the ferry sinking, as 'the greatest catastrophe in Sweden's modern history'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="13"> Over 500 of the victims, numbering at least 800, were Swedish.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="14"> The dismay in Sweden has eclipsed even the shock of the assassination of prime minister Olof Palme in 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="15"> Sweden, often joked about for its northern reserve and tranquillity, is more used to mobilising its aid agencies to help the victims of disaster in faraway places than to coping with trauma at home.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="16"> Yesterday, crisis groups were set up in many cities and towns to offer support and counselling for bereaved families.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="17"> The sheer scale of the fatalities had a profound impact on a nation of 8.5m people.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="18"> The shock was heightened by the popularity of Baltic cruises among ordinary Swedes, thousands of whom take short excursion trips on similar ferries to Finland, St Petersburg and the newly independent Baltic states.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="19"> The victims yesterday included a group of 53 pensioners from the eastern city of Norrkoping, 44 retired trade unionists from the western town of Borlange, 70 office workers from the Stockholm county police and 20 pupils from a bible school in the central city of Jonjoping.</s>

<s docid="FT943-535" num="20"> Mr Bildt, like many Stockholmers, recalled he had himself sailed on the Estonia and said he knew several people aboard the ship when it sank.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="7"> If regulation alone could prevent ferries sinking, then the Estonia would never have gone down in the icy waters of the Baltic.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="8"> Shipping safety has engaged the attention of dozens of committees sitting for thousands of hours in recent years and the conventions which roll out of the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation are constantly being revised and upgraded.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="9"> All this earnest activity has still not prevented heavily laden ferries sinking in the coastal waters of the Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh in recent years with enormous loss of life.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="10"> The regulations are international in their scope but the losses have been their most severe in the developing world.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="11"> It took the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise with the loss of 193 lives in March 1987 to show that standards needed to be raised even in the traditional shipping nations.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="12"> An official inquiry concluded that the British ferry, owned by P & O, sank because a crewman left the bow doors open.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="13"> The ship's officers failed to notice because of a culture of 'sloppiness' throughout the P & O subsidiary that operated the ship.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="14"> The inquiry recommended a series of safety improvements, such as higher vehicle decks, closed circuit TV supervision of bow and stern doors, better emergency lighting, loading and stability checks, and passenger and vehicle listing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="15"> The loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise prompted the British government to push for a stricter interpretation of the international safety rules than most countries were prepared to accept.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="16"> The result has been that the UK and nine other European nations, including Sweden, have imposed tougher regulations on the stability of ferries and have insisted on their more rapid application to existing, as well as to new, vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="17"> These rules come into effect in two days' time.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="18"> These stability rules are unlikely to have had any impact on the Estonia, however, which was regarded as a well found vessel designed to operate in the frequently ice-bound Baltic.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="19"> Investigators will undoubtedly be looking closely at how the crew carried out their duties.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="20"> And for all the wealth of safety legislation there has been little progress in overcoming the biggest single safety problem on roll-on roll-off ferries -the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship to the other, usually with doors at one or both ends.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="21"> One survivor of yesterday's sinking suggested that one of the forward loading ramps of the Estonia had not shut properly while another report suggested that the loading door seals were faulty.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="22"> Shipowners maintain that ro-ro ferries are viable only if large numbers of vehicles can be loaded and unloaded quickly, allowing rapid turnround times and frequent sailings.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="23"> This means that neither space nor time is wasted, but comparatively small quantities of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop a heavy list, and capsize.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="24"> This problem, called the free surface effect, was what sank the Herald.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="25"> It can be prevented, but only by inserting vertical bulkheads across the vehicle deck, which would slow loading.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="26"> For all the good intentions transformed into international safety agreements, the IMO and governments around the world have come to realise that effective enforcement of the rules is still woefully lacking.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="27"> The IMO is shifting its attention to ensuring that its many maritime agreements are enforced and recently reached agreement to give port authorities greater powers to inspect visiting shipping.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="28"> Traditionally the country under whose flag a ship sails is responsible for ensuring that the vessel is well built and well maintained.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="29"> But the failure of many 'flags of convenience' to take these duties seriously has seen power shift to the authorities in the port where the ship docks.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="30"> The west European countries work together to enforce shipping standards through their port organisations while similar regional groupings of 'port states' are being put together in other parts of the world.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="31"> Estonia, newly independent after the break-up of the Soviet Union, has yet to establish a track-record in the supervision of the ships which sail under its flag.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="32"> But the Swedish involvement in the ship's ownership is seen as a guarantee of quality.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="33"> It will be some time before the official enquiries which are just beginning provide an explanation for the loss of the Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT943-536" num="34"> But the loss of a relatively modern vessel in rough but not unusual seas raises worrying questions about the effectiveness of the regulations and their enforcement.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="7"> Sweden's senior maritime safety officer yesterday questioned the safety of roll-on roll-off ferries with opening bow sections and said he was considering restricting their operations following the sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea with the loss of as many as 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="8"> In statements likely to reverberate throughout the shipping industry, Mr Bengt-Erik Stenmark, the government's director of maritime safety, said the National Maritime Board had been informed since the Estonia sank of some six recent 'near accidents' in waters around Sweden, involving the failure of opening bow sections, which had not previously been reported to the authorities.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="9"> He said 'all the indications' were that water entering the Estonia, jointly operated by Swedish and Estonian shipping companies, through the bow section was the 'final cause' of Wednesday's catastrophe - although it may have been the culmination of a chain of events including the shifting of improperly secured cargo.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="10"> 'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea,' Mr Stenmark said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="11"> He said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections using Swedish ports should be inspected urgently.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="12"> He was especially concerned about ships which, like the Estonia, have visor-type bows that swing open vertically.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="13"> He said he would decide by early next week whether to impose restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending a fuller inquiry into their safety.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="14"> He added that he believed the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations organisation that sets standards for the shipping industry, should study the whole issue of the safety of opening bow sections on ro-ro ferries.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="15"> 'It is a question of design,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="16"> The IMO confirmed that the danger of water penetrating the bow doors of roll-on roll-off vessels was one of the most important issues under consideration in its safety committees.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="17"> However, it said there was no evidence that this had proved to be a widespread problem.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="18"> The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, came to light through informal contacts with the Maritime Board made by crew members of ships and staff members of shipping companies shocked by the Estonia sinking, the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="19"> 'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="20"> 'Some ship owners have neglected to report these near accidents'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="21"> A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the main report on the Estonia disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="22"> They began interviewing survivors yesterday, including a crew member and a passenger who both reported seeing water rushing on to the car deck shortly before the ship foundered.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="23"> Officials at Estline, the operator of the Estonia, said they did not believe a failure of the bow doors had caused the sinking, but they admitted they had 'no concrete explanation' of why the ship sank so suddenly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="24"> Confusion continued yesterday over how many passengers were on board the Estonia when it sank.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="25"> The main rescue centre at Turku, Finland, said it now understood more than 1,000 people were aboard, compared with reports of about 960 on Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="26"> Rescue officials also appeared uncertain about how many people survived, but the highest figure was only 147.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="27"> Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) following the disaster, but it is likely that the loss will be absorbed by international markets relatively easily.</s>

<s docid="FT943-316" num="28"> Liability claims are not expected to exceed Dollars 60m.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="7"> Sweden's government disclosed yesterday that six recent 'near accidents' in its waters involving roll-on roll-off ferries had come to light since the sinking of the Estonia on Wednesday with the loss of up to 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="8"> Details of the incidents emerged as Finland and Sweden ordered widespread inspections of ferries for bow door weaknesses following the sinking in the Baltic Sea - the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="9"> The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, were disclosed through informal contacts between the Maritime Board, crew members of ships and staff of shipping companies shocked by the Estonia sinking.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="10"> Mr Bjorn-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's director of maritime safety, said that in the worst incident a large ferry of similar size to the Estonia sailing between Sweden and Finland was only saved by the skilful manoeuvring of the ship by its captain after water had flooded into the cargo deck through the bow.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="11"> 'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="12"> 'Some ship owners have neglected to report these near accidents.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="13"> 'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="14"> Referring to the Estonia disaster, Mr Stenmark said: 'The huge catastrophe with the sinking of the Estonia perhaps could have been avoided if the shipowners had followed the law and reported earlier close calls with ferries of the Estonia-type construction'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="15"> In Stockholm, the technical director of Swedish shipper Nordstrom & Thulin, co-owner of the Estonia, also said water entering the bow doors may have caused it to sink.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="16"> 'There is reason to suspect that this was the main cause of the accident,' Mr Sten Forsberg said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="17"> But he ruled out the possibility that seals on one of the two doors shielding the car deck from the water was faulty, as had been alleged by a Swedish seamen's union leader.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="18"> Mr Forsberg said the seals had recently passed an international inspection.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="19"> Mr Stenmark said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections using Swedish ports should be inspected urgently.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="20"> There is particular concern about ships with visor-type bows which, like those on the Estonia, swing open vertically.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="21"> Mr Stenmark said he would decide by early next week whether to impose restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending a fuller inquiry into their safety.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="22"> Announcing its own inspections, the Finnish interior ministry said: 'All ferries, car, passenger and train ferries which fly the Finnish flag will be subjected to inspections. . . within a week.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="23"> Special attention will be paid to cargo doors, front and back, and to alarm and monitoring systems'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="24"> Meanwhile, the Estonian government said it had been given a list of 1,051 names of passengers who had bought tickets to travel on the Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="25"> Original estimates had put the number of passengers at 960.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="26"> Mr Heiki Arike, the home affairs minister, said the list was larger than previous estimates because it included children under the age of five - but also passengers who may not have turned up for the voyage.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="27"> Rescue officials still appear uncertain about how many people survived the disaster, but the highest figure was only 147.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="28"> The Finnish coastguard said about 90 bodies had been recovered.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="29"> A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the main report on the Estonia disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT943-312" num="30"> Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) following the disaster.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="5"> Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="6"> But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="7"> As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="8"> The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="9"> The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="10"> But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="11"> Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="12"> Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="13"> Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="14"> First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="15"> Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="16"> Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="17"> These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="18"> It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="19"> Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="20"> But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="21"> Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="22"> The IMO has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="23"> Third, the IMO should be given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="24"> Much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="25"> Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="26"> As things stand, it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="27"> The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding up the process.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="28"> Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="29"> Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="30"> But this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="31"> When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid.</s>

<s docid="FT943-178" num="32"> If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="6"> International moves to strengthen safety controls on roll-on roll-off ferries gathered pace yesterday with the announcement by the International Maritime Organisation of plans to establish a panel of safety experts to recommend action.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="7"> The efforts by the IMO, an arm of the United Nations, follow the sinking in the Baltic last Wednesday of the car ferry Estonia with the loss of more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="8"> The proposal by IMO's secretary general, Mr William O'Neil, is unprecedented in the organisation's 35-year history and is intended to shorten its frequently lengthy procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="9"> Even so, a final decision to go ahead with the panel will not be taken until its safety committee meets in two months.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="10"> At the same time, the UK department of transport's marine safety agency said it would ask its surveyors to carry out immediate checks on the bow doors of all ro-ro passenger ferries operating out of UK ports.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="11"> Mr Robin Bradley, chief executive of the agency, described this move as 'precautionary' but added: 'In the light of the evidence emerging from the Estonia, I believe it is important we should take this additional safety measure'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="12"> Checks of vessels' inner and outer bow doors will be carried out within the next 28 days.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="13"> Inspectors will also examine closing procedures, surveillance equipment and indicators.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="14"> P&O European Ferries, which operates 45 ferries, said it hoped these moves would put an end to speculation and start to establish some facts about ferry safety.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="15"> The IMO expert panel will be headed by Mr Giuliano Pattofatto, an Italian naval architect and chairman of the organisation's safety committee.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="16"> It will consist of representatives of member governments and outside experts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="17"> It is expected to begin its work after the next meeting of the IMO's safety committee between December 5 and 9 and present its recommendations to the next meeting of that committee in May 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="18"> 'The idea is to speed up the process of review instead of deferring it to a sub-committee meeting in three months time,' Mr Roger Kohn, the IMO spokesman said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="19"> 'Nothing will be excluded.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="20"> You have got to prove to the travelling public that you are looking at everything seriously and give reassurance'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="21"> Like other IMO committees the expert panel will only be able to make recommendations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="22"> But only a small number of countries operate ro-ro ferries and since they will be represented on the panel they can be expected to carry out its suggestions, Mr Kohn said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="23"> Most ro-ro ferries are in use in Europe, Japan and Australasia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="24"> The IMO has been criticised in the past by some of its more safety-conscious member governments for the slow pace of its deliberations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="25"> The UK clashed with other members over plans for a tightening up of ferry regulations in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 and last year warned that countries would take unilateral action if the IMO did not move more quickly.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="26"> IMO officials point out, however, that the 149-member organisation has to work by achieving consensus.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="27"> 'For some of our members the pace is unbearably quick, for others we are very slow,' Mr Fernando Plaza, a senior safety director said recently.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="28"> The IMO has created 30 conventions, which are mandatory on member governments, as well as more than 700 codes, which are advisory, on a wide range of maritime safety issues.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="29"> But it depends on governments to ratify and enforce its regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="30"> In its early days amendments to conventions required ratification by two-thirds of member governments before they took effect.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="31"> Many proposals took years to implement, so in the early 1970s this was changed to make amendments effective unless one-third of members rejected them.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="32"> At present member governments are given two years or more to consider amendments but this is shortly to be reduced to 18 months.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="33"> The IMO is constrained by the need to balance the interests of developing countries, where economic development often takes precedence over safety considerations, and those of western nations where the public demands higher safety standards.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="34"> 'We produce the highest practicable standards, not the highest possible ones,' said Mr Plaza.</s>

<s docid="FT944-17957" num="35"> The transport committee of the European parliament is to discuss ferry safety when it meets next Monday.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="6"> Two shipping disasters in the past week have lent fresh urgency to a safety review which starts today at the London-based International Maritime Organisation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="7"> The maritime safety committee had already planned to focus on roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry safety after the sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic in September with the loss of more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="8"> Last week's sinking of a Philippines ferry, with the loss of more than 140 lives, and a fire on the cruise liner Achille Lauro, which cost two lives and gutted the vessel, have increased pressure on the committee to tighten up regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="9"> The role of the IMO, a United Nations agency, is to improve maritime safety and prevent pollution from ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="10"> It works through a number of technical committees and relies on persuading member nations to adopt the treaties they devise.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="11"> The maritime safety committee has representatives from most of the IMO's 150 member countries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="12"> Prompted by the sinking of the Estonia, Mr William O'Neil, IMO general secretary, has proposed the creation of a panel of safety experts to recommend action in the hope of shortening the normally lengthy procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="13"> Mr O'Neil said: 'We cannot simply refer to what has been done during the past few years and claim that there is no need for further action.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="14"> The only way of reassuring people that ro-ro ferries are safe is by looking at every aspect of operations and ensuring any problems are remedied'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5248" num="15"> Particular attention will be paid to the strength and watertightness of bow and stern doors, the advisability of fitting internal bulkheads on the vehicle deck and the need for guidelines on operations in adverse weather conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="7"> Baltic ferry operators are to take immediate steps to secure the bow doors of their ships after investigators confirmed that the Estonia sank last week because its outer bow door had been ripped off in stormy seas.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="8"> Viking Line and Silja Line, the Baltic's two biggest roll-on roll-off ferry operators, said they planned to weld shut the bow doors of their ferries, restricting vehicle loading and unloading to the stern of the ship.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="9"> A similar move was announced by Nordstrom & Thulin, the Swedish joint owner of the Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="10"> Nordstrom said it would permanently seal the bow doors of the Vironia, a replacement ferry which is due to start sailing between Stockholm and Tallinn later this month.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="11"> The arrangement would 'totally remove possible safety risks' at the front of the vessel, a sister ship of the Estonia, it stated.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="12"> Securing the bow doors will increase loading and port turnround times.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="13"> Mr Harry Kulovaara, Silja Line executive vice-president, said: 'We think our boats are totally safe but in this situation it is most probable that we will weld the outer doors of some of our ferries'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="14"> British ferry companies indicated last night that they were unlikely to follow the Baltic operators' example.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18499" num="15"> Stena Sealink, UK arm of the Swedish group, said ferry companies could not act independently but would wait for directions from the Transport Department.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="6"> The missing bow section of the ferry Estonia, which sank in the Baltic Sea last month with the loss of 900 lives, was found yesterday lying in 76m of water about 2km west of the wrecked ship.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="7"> The joint Estonian-Finnish-Swedish investigation team is anxious to inspect the visor-like outer bow door, which caused the Estonia to capsize and founder when it was torn off in a storm off the south west coast of Finland during an overnight voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="8"> Evidence from video camera inspections of the wreck has shown that all three locks designed to hold the 55-tonne bow section in place had broken.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="9"> Investigators believe the bow section smashed against the hull and inner vehicle deck door before it broke away, allowing water to enter the vehicle deck, causing the ship to sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="10"> They believe it took only 15 or 20 minutes before the Estonia, jointly operated by Estonian and Swedish shipping companies, rolled on its side and began to sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="11"> The bow section will now be surveyed with video cameras in an effort to find further evidence of why the locks failed.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="12"> The inquiry team will also hope to salvage the bow section so they can investigate whether metal fatigue was to blame.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="13"> The Swedish government is considering salvaging the main wreck, but experts say such a complex and costly operation could not be done until the spring.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="14"> So far there has been no definite evidence of human error causing the bow doors to fail.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15143" num="15"> Surviving crew members have told investigators the inner bow door, which should have proved watertight, had been closed.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18592" num="13"> As memorial services were held at churches throughout Sweden, Finland and Estonia yesterday, a Finnish search vessel carrying robot-mounted cameras filmed the Estonia wreck to try to assess why the vessel sank, and the difficulty of recovering the 800 bodies believed to be inside.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="7"> The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for shipping, yesterday ordered a top-level inquiry into the safety of vehicle ferries following the loss of more than 900 lives in the Estonia disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="8"> The inquiry was announced as Sweden's National Maritime Board said the Estonia may have sunk because its outer bow door was ripped off in a storm, allowing water to pour on to the ship's cavernous vehicle deck.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="9"> It also emerged that the Europa, one of the ships that picked up survivors of the Estonia tragedy, suffered serious damage to its bow door in the heavy seas that lashed the rescue fleet.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="10"> As concern about the operation of roll-on roll-off ships grew, Mr William O'Neil, the IMO secretary-general, ordered a full safety review by the organisation's maritime safety committee.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="11"> IMO officials said the committee would consider all aspects of roll-on roll-off shipping at its next meeting in December at the org-anisation's London headquarters.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="12"> No agenda has yet been drawn up, but the committee is thought certain to consider whether bulkheads on the ships' open vehicle decks would help to increase stability in the event of a surge of water through the doors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="13"> Most ship owners believe bulkheads would reduce the profitability of roll-on roll-off ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="14"> But an IMO official said the review's 'prime consideration' would be safety.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="15"> 'The travelling public are entitled to know that economic considerations come second,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="16"> The committee has the power to amend the 1981 international convention on the safety of life at sea, which provides the framework for national shipping legislation in 122 countries covering 97 per cent of world tonnage.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="17"> However, the committee is expected to produce a full report on the implications of the Estonia disaster before deciding whether to call a special meeting to consider changes to the convention.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="18"> Mr Bengt-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's head of maritime safety, said the joint Estonian-Finnish-Swedish team investigating the disaster had been told by witnesses that the visor-style outer bow door was missing when the ship sank.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="19"> 'The outer door was lost,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="20"> Witnesses saw 30-35cm of water on the car deck, enough to destabilise the vessel, he added.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="21"> Inspectors carrying out urgent checks of all roll-on roll-off ferries calling at Swedish ports said the port bow door on the Europa, a 3,000-passenger ferry operated by the Silja Line, suffered damaged hinges during the storm and could not be opened.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="22"> The Europa, the biggest ferry of its kind sailing in the Baltic, was allowed to sail for Finland last night after the Finnish-based Silja Line said it would only load the ship by its aft doors until repairs had been carried out.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18938" num="23"> A Finnish search boat last night located the wreck of the Estonia, at a depth of 250-280 ft, 25 miles south-west of the Finnish island of Uto.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="6"> Somehow, it has happened again.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="7"> Seven years after the British vehicle ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized off Zeebrugge with the loss of 193 lives, the Estonia disaster has focused world attention on a question that shipowners hoped had gone away: are roll-on, roll-off ships like these inherently unsafe?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="8"> The answer will depend on the conclusions of the various inquiries into the Estonia sinking, now thought to have cost more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="9"> But if the inquiries decide, as seems likely, that the Estonia sank because water entered the vehicle deck, the consequences for the ferry industry will be dramatic.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="10"> At the least, public opinion could force governments to insist on expensive structural changes, making new ships less able to compete with aircraft and undersea train services like those through the Channel tunnel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="11"> At worst, shipowners could be forced to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on rebuilding existing ships to tougher safety standards.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="12"> That would have serious economic implications, especially in Europe, where the speed and flexibility of vehicle ferries has made them indispensable to trade between continental Europe and the outlying economies in the British Isles and Scandinavia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="13"> There are more than 500 ferry sailings across the North Sea and the English Channel every day; worldwide, the number of such ferries in use has risen to 2,158 this year from 1,847 when the Herald capsized.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="14"> No-one knows how much traffic these ferries carry, but they have the capacity to carry 9m gross tons of traffic a day - a third more than seven years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="15"> The talk in shipping circles yesterday was of waiting to see what caused the Estonia to sink, of not jumping to conclusions, of the possibility that the disaster could have been caused by anything from an engine explosion to a mine from the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="16"> But all the signs point towards a surge of water entering the vehicle deck through one of the main doors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="17"> Much has been done to improve the safety of roll-on, roll-off ferries since 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="18"> The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for shipping, agreed in 1988 to raise stability requirements for new ferries from 1990 and in 1992 to phase in tougher requirements for older ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="19"> The rules also require improvements such as closed circuit television supervision of vehicle decks, and lighting to help survivors of an accident reach safety.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="20"> Some shipowners have also fitted sponsons - stabilising bulges just above the waterline, to improve stability, although there is no requirement to do so.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="21"> The UK went further, passing domestic legislation requiring all ships visiting UK ports to meet the full 1990 standards.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="22"> This forced shipowners to scrap older ferries that could not be improved, or to transfer them to countries with less rigid safety standards.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="23"> However, neither the UK nor the IMO addressed the biggest danger of roll-on, roll-off ferries - the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship to the other.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="24"> The design of such ships dates back to the 1950s, when trade was picking up rapidly after the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="25"> Shipowners realised that cargoes could be transported more quickly and efficiently if cars and lorries could be driven straight onto their ships at the dockside and off again at the end of the journey.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="26"> The easiest way to do that is provide one or more vehicle decks, accessible through large doors in the hull, running the length of the ship.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="27"> The design works best if the deck is uninterrupted by walls - known to mariners as bulkheads - which complicate vehicle loading.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="28"> The result is that the protection afforded by bulkheads below the vehicle decks is undermined by a huge and vulnerable open space in the middle of the ship.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="29"> The space is perfectly safe while it remains dry.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="30"> But small quantities of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop a heavy list and to capsize within a few minutes.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="31"> An independent inquiry in the UK, conducted by Mr Justice Sheen after the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise, concluded that this problem, called the free surface effect, was responsible for the disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="32"> The judge concluded that forcing shipowners to place vertical transverse bulkheads across vehicle decks would make roll-on, roll-off ferries uneconomic.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="33"> The IMO also avoided any mention of vehicle deck bulkheads in its 1990 standards, preferring to wait for the results of a UK-Danish technical study on design and construction; the next stage of the report will be released in November.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="34"> But if the free surface effect sank the Estonia, the demand for action is likely to become irresistible.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="35"> Pressure for tougher regulations has come from survivors of major accidents, including the Herald sinking, who have given first hand accounts of the chaos involved in a capsize.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="36"> Survivors of the Estonia tragedy have similar stories.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="37"> There is a wealth of expert opinion on their side.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="38"> The late Professor Dick Bishop, a leading naval architect who was also vice-president of Britain's prestigious Royal Society, was a strong supporter of bulkheads.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="39"> Mr Alan Gilfillan, vice-chairman of the safety committee of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, said yesterday that the Estonia sinking reopened the question of whether they should be made mandatory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="40"> Most shipowners say that it cannot be done.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="41"> Inserting transverse bulkheads would cost up to Pounds 600,000 for each ship, and would probably destroy their ability to compete with alternative forms of transport.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="42"> Longitudinal bulkheads, running from bow to stern, would pose fewer problems, but might also be less effective, they say.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="43"> 'These ships are inherently safe until something totally unexpected happens.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="44"> They have done a wonderful job for 30 years with very few accidents.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="45"> It is important that we wait for the result of the inquiries into the Estonia, and don't jump to the wrong conclusions about what needs to be done,' said Mr Jim Davis, chairman of the International Maritime Industries Forum, a shipowners organisation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="46"> Mr William O'Neil, the IMO secretary general, recognised the depth of concern yesterday by ordering a review of vehicle ferries by the maritime safety committee, which can amend international regulations subscribed to by countries accounting for 97 per cent of world shipping tonnage.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="47"> There are many issues before the committee, including the extent to which roll-on roll-off ferries can turn into death-traps in extreme circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="48"> Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope with emergencies.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="49"> But, as the Estonia showed, even the best-prepared crews and passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="50"> The horrific reports from the Estonia of panic-stricken and disorientated passengers clambering over one another are evidence that emergency plans do not count for much in a ship that is capsizing or sinking rapidly.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="51"> The pictures of survivors and dead bodies in semi-swamped rubber rafts bear testimony to the effectiveness of life boats in those circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="52"> They also add to the pressure on governments and shipowners to restore public confidence about the safety of shipping.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18875" num="53"> The lesson of the last seven years, however, is that there are no easy answers.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="6"> It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="7"> The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic, on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="8"> The Titanic went down after it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="9"> Only 705 of the 2,228 passengers and crew survived.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="10"> Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the two doomed vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="11"> Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but both were found wanting.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="12"> The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than the number of passengers and crew.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="13"> Its designers added a 12 per cent safety margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still only enough lifeboats for half those on board.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="14"> A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="15"> For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="16"> The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="17"> But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="18"> RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and raise material.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="19"> The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research Institute.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="20"> It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="21"> RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it on general display.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="22"> It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="23"> Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="24"> Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="25"> The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="26"> There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish a permanent museum to display the material.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="27"> The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="28"> All the details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no engines or steering gear.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="29"> As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and landed in two separate sections.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="30"> When it hit the ocean floor the bow section ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash was caused by the iceberg.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="31"> 'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45 years.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="32"> Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="33"> A decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="34"> Although very few survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="35"> Eaton confesses to finding this ban 'very frustrating'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="36"> Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="37"> A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in 1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="38"> Dr Kentley thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull before it disintegrates.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="39"> RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="40"> However, even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6974" num="41"> The exhibition, says Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties'.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="6"> The government is to increase checks on roll-on roll-off ferries after one in three of the vessels operating from British ports was found to have faulty bow doors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="7"> Thirty-five of the 107 ferries inspected had minor defects when the Department of Transport's marine safety agency carried out the checks after the sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic in September with the loss of 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="8"> The faults included leaky rubber seals and fractures to brackets and fittings on the bow doors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="9"> Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said yesterday that all the vessels tested were watertight and fundamentally sound.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="10"> However, one vessel, the Winston Churchill, a Danish-flagged ferry plying between Newcastle and Esbjerg, was temporarily detained for repairs to its stern door.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="11"> The findings come just before the start of passenger shuttle services through the Channel tunnel that are expected to take a large share of the ferries' cross-Channel business.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="12"> Ships flying the UK flag had a higher incidence of defects than the foreign-flagged vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="13"> Of the 58 UK-flagged vessels, 36 per cent needed repairs, compared with 28 per cent of the 49 foreign-flagged ships.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="14"> Dr Mawhinney said he was surprised that faults had been found with as many as 35 ferries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="15"> He was in Dover watching tests on the inner bow doors of the Pride of Calais, a six-year-old vessel operated by P&O European ferries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="16"> Water from a high-pressure hose failed to penetrate the door seals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="17"> Dr Mawhinney said the marine safety agency had been asked to increase the number of unscheduled inspections and to write to all ferry operators to remind them of the need to pay attention 'to even the smallest safety detail, so as to maintain safety standards at the highest levels'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="18"> The agency is also to carry out computer studies on the effect of water penetrating bow doors and whether internal bulkheads, urged by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and others, would make any difference.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="19"> The government would order a redesign of ferries only if there was strong evidence that bulkheads would provide a safety benefit.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="20"> UK ferries are surveyed once every 12 months by agency inspectors when the passenger ship safety certificate is renewed.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="21"> Unscheduled inspections are carried out at least twice a year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-11048" num="22"> Since the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 with the loss of 193 lives, teams of surveyors also travel incognito on ferries operating from UK ports to observe them at work.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="5"> By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="6"> Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, last night launched a fierce attack on the government for failing to impose the same high safety standards on the ferry companies as it had on Euro-tunnel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="7"> Sir Alastair broke with the tradition that has prevented the ferries and the tunnel operator from commenting publicly on each other's safety problems in a speech to the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="8"> He said: 'The government made us spend tens, even hundreds of millions of pounds from our own capital - including the vast cost of transverse bulkheads between every wagon on our shuttles.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="9"> And yet that government steps back from burdening the ferries with a few million in essential costs'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="10"> Sir Alastair's remarks came a day after Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, announced that a safety review of ferries operating from British ports had found bow-door defects on one in three ferries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="11"> The review was prompted by the sinking in the Baltic of the ferry Estonia with the loss of more than 900 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="12"> The French and British governments had compelled Eurotunnel to prepare a 300-page 'safety case', describing its safety features and procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="13"> As a result it was 20 times safer than an equivalent stretch of railway, Sir Alastair said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="14"> Other complex industries such as nuclear power generation and aviation also had to operate by high safety standards.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="15"> However, the ferries had only been required to reach 'a very modest and clearly inadequate level of partial safety' under international rules for safety at sea, he added.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="16"> The government had had several years to work out tough safety standards for Eurotunnel and at the same time ensure that equal standards were imposed on its competitors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="17"> 'Only now, as we start up, is it possible to confirm that no equality of requirement has been established.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="18"> 'We object fiercely and with intensity when we observe cost given by the ferries as the reason for failing to remedy what appear to be inherently unsafe ship designs'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-10853" num="19"> In spite of what in effect is a subsidy provided by the right to make duty-free sales, the ferries were permitted to avoid relatively modest investments in safety, Sir Alastair said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="6"> On an April night in 1991, an Italian car ferry, the Moby Prince, ran into an oil tanker outside the port of Livorno and 140 people died in the blaze.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="7"> It was Italy's worst maritime disaster since the second world war.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="8"> The crew of the tanker, the Agip Abruzzo, survived.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="9"> But the radio messages sent by Moby Prince went unheeded, both by other ships in the vicinity of Livorno - the accident occurred 2.5 miles out to sea - and on land.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="10"> One sailor escaped, but the passengers and the rest of the ferry crew died - the lifeboats had been burned and the sea was covered in blazing oil.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="11"> The Italian courts are still trying to decide what happened and who was responsible - many on shore and at sea were watching a televised football match.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="12"> The judges are faced by a seemingly inexplicable tangle of negligence and even possible sabotage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="13"> Evidence of explosives was found on the ferry, whose victims were not discovered until the following day.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="14"> Fortunately, tragedies like this are uncommon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="15"> But they do emphasise the need for the speedier introduction of advanced technologies and systems on shore and at sea not only to prevent loss of life, damage and pollution, but also to establish the cause of accidents.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="16"> Most accidents do not make headlines.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="17"> Another that did was the sinking of The Herald of Free Enterprise, a UK ferry, off the Belgian coast in 1987 with the loss of 193 lives.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="18"> Oil-polluting incidents, such as the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska waters in 1989 or the sinking of the Braer off the Scottish coast a year ago, also gain worldwide attention.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="19"> Because not all incidents are reported, statistics may understate the level of casualties.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="20"> Last year, 246 people were killed or missing at sea and 213 ships lost, according to Lloyd's Register.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="21"> In 1991, lives lost were much higher at 1,204, with vessel losses at 258.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="22"> Since the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which the hold flooded rapidly when the cargo door was not shut, tougher international regulations are being introduced on internal strength and stability in case of damage for roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="23"> Because of their cavernous cargo capacity, ro-ros - especially older ones - can become dangerously unstable if not properly handled.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="24"> There is no evidence that the Moby Prince was defective.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="25"> But it is proving hard to find out what really happened.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="26"> Captain Profeta Brandimarte, a marine consultant involved in the investigations, says the response has been blank - 'no one saw, heard or did anything'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="27"> The investigation would be helped considerably if the ships had been fitted with a recording device, similar to an aircraft's black box.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="28"> The mystery of the Derbyshire, a bulk carrier which sank in a typhoon off Japan 13 years ago with the loss of 44 lives might also be capable of solution if the events leading up to its disappearance were available on tape; no trace of the ship was found.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="29"> Black boxes, or voyage event recorders - much bigger than those on aircraft and able to float free - are among the array of advanced technological equipment being introduced on worldwide fleets and on shore.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="30"> Others include electronic charts, one-man bridges, databases on the condition of ships (for use by port authorities) and vessel traffic systems in busy areas like the English Channel and Straits of Singapore.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="31"> Malek Pourzanjani, head of research at Southampton Institute's maritime division, is a firm advocate of VTS.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="32"> 'This is the way forward - local VTSs are emerging and being formed into regional and perhaps national and international centres'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="33"> Under forthcoming EU rules, vessels entering European waters will be required to radio their approach and route ahead of their arrival to make it easier for authorities to monitor their movements.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="34"> Since nearly all the world's cargoes go by sea, maritime safety is of concern to most governments.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="35"> The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a United Nations body based in London, is responsible for drawing up safety and pollution conventions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="36"> But it is the 147 member countries which are responsible for enforcing them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="37"> Some are more effective than others.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="38"> With more shipowners moving to cheaper foreign flags and crews, implementing conventions such as Solas on safety and Marpol on pollution has become harder.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="39"> Flag state control, in which governments control vessels flying their flag, does not always work.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="40"> Hence the increasing emphasis on port state control, in which the port authorities do the job.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="41"> Apart from the proliferation of flags and ship classification societies - there are around 50 of the latter - another problem is the increasing age of the world fleet.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="42"> The shipping industry has had a rough time as a result of over-capacity and the failure of freight rates to provide adequate returns.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="43"> This discourages new building and leads to vessels being kept in service for longer than desirable.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="44"> The average oil tanker is 16 years old and the average bulk carrier 13 years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="45"> 'The market doesn't pay the appropriate return for transportation,' says James Bell, permanent secretary at the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) representing 11 societies covering 90 per cent of world tonnage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="46"> But commercial and regulatory pressures on owners are increasing.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="47"> 'It makes good commercial sense to operate to the highest quality standards,' says Peter Thomas, a director of Britain's P&O Group, whose passenger and cargo fleet is being fitted with voyage recorders.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="48"> 'It affects corporate reputation and profitability'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="49"> Other western European fleets are also conscious of safety, both for its own sake and as a part of their image.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="50"> The recorders are being fitted by Nedlloyd, the Dutch company, on its North Sea Ferries venture with P&O.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="51"> Developed by P&O's subsidiary Three Quays International and its Broadgate electronics unit, they provide a 24-hour record of radar, position, engine and other data, including conversations on the ship's bridge.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="52"> 'This gives investigators access to the quality evidence that aircraft have,' says Bruce Standring, Three Quays' managing director.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="53"> He hopes they will be made mandatory under IMO's safety convention.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="54"> Also under discussion within IMO is the issue of whether to build up a comprehensive database on the quality of individual vessels for use by ports.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="55"> This would be along the lines of the one developed by the US Coastguard.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="56"> Electronic charts, which are presented on screen and use positioning data from satellites and information from ships' own sensors, are another innovation which owners and seafarers are gradually coming to accept, though international standards are still being worked out.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="57"> 'Until about a year-and-a-half ago, nine out of 10 mariners would have said 'why do we need this'?</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="58"> It was the typical marine attitude - very conservative and anti-technology,' says Helmut Lanziner, president of Vancouver-based Offshore Systems.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="59"> Now, he adds, it is a Dollars 1bn a year business.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="60"> Instead of having to update charts by hand, with the delays this causes, the task can be done digitally at extreme speed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="61"> This is especially important in confined areas such as harbours and channels where most accidents occur.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="62"> It also means ships need fewer people on the bridge to collect and monitor information.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="63"> Hapag-Lloyd of Germany is one company which has adopted the one-man bridge on its container ships.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="64"> One specially trained person can run the ship, surrounded in a cockpit-type enclosure by all the necessary instruments and indicators.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="65"> Yet although the trend is clear, not all shipowners look to the technological horizon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="66"> 'A casual look round the bridge of a ship shows technology embraced in a piecemeal fashion,' Admiral Sir Julian Oswald told a recent conference organised by the Southampton Institute.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="67"> 'Big heavy levers mingle with microprocessors.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="68"> It's an environment fit for the ergonomist's black museum'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-1954" num="69"> Unfortunately, all too many ships on the world's oceans today still meet this description.</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="6"> Sir, In the past few weeks two disasters at sea have warranted front-page headlines in the press.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="7"> In the sinking of the ferry Estonia, more than 900 lives were lost; following the fire on the Achille Lauro cruise ship, almost all of the 1,000 passengers were saved.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="8"> The reasons?</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="9"> The roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) design of the Estonia caused it to capsize completely in a few minutes with no time for evacuation; the Achille Lauro remained upright and afloat for many hours, with ample time for evacuation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="10"> There must be an overriding objective to design new ships or modify existing ro-ro ships such that, following a significant ingress of water, an essentially upright position is maintained for at least 30 minutes to make evacuation practicable.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="11"> Passengers on ro-ro ships are entitled to expect the same standards to ensure survival as those which apply to conventional passenger vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="12"> Engineering solutions are available and cost or operational disadvantages must not be allowed to stand in the way of this entirely logical objective.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2383" num="13"> The Royal Academy of Engineering is examining the matter and will be consulting shipowners among others.</s>
