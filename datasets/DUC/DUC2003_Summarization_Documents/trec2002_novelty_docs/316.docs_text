<s docid="FT932-3422" num="5"> By FRANCIS GHILES</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="6"> ONE OF the key reasons President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali is opposed to granting legal recognition to the al Nahda (Renaissance) opposition party - whose creed is Islam - is fear that such a move risks undoing what many Tunisians regard as their country's proudest achievement since independence; the corpus of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and gave Tunisian women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="7"> The 'Personal Status Code' is, arguably, former president Habib Bourguiba's greatest single achievement.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="8"> It was promulgated the year Tunisia gained independence from France, a year before the new constitution that abolished the monarchy.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="9"> The rights of women were further consolidated last August by the national assembly.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="10"> In the case of divorce, for instance, custody no longer goes automatically to the husband.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="11"> Violence against women within the family is punishable, women can request a passport without going through their father or husband and the state helps divorced women to secure alimony.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="12"> Since 1956 a policy of family planning has been in place.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="13"> In the early 1960s free and confidential advice and prophylactics were made available to women.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="14"> Combined with efforts to promote health and education, these policies reduced population growth from 3.2 to 1.9 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="15"> The birth rate has declined from 45 to 25.4 per thousand, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per thousand.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="16"> The illiteracy rate has been brought down from 87.7 per cent to 35 per cent, though the figure is higher among women in poorer country areas.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="17"> Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine, architecture - in factories as workers, engineers, managers and owners.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="18"> But Tunisian politics remains very much a man's world, despite some remarkable exceptions, including Fethia Baccouche and Hanoun Houda, who are deputies, two secretaries of state and a handful of senior civil servants such as Fayza Kefi, whose presides over the Union Nationale des Femmes de Tunisie.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="19"> Most educated women have no lost love for the teachings of radical Islamic groups.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="20"> Though al Nahda leaders have said they accept many of Mr Bourguiba's inheritance, women are mindful of the often violent track record of some supporters of the party, notably the throwing of acid in the faces of university students on the campus in Tunis.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="21"> History teaches women that radical Islam has not been sympathetic to the idea of equality between sexes or to their presence in public places.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="22"> The history of modern Tunisia suggests that the emancipation of women has been a key factor in explaining the country's social and economic progress since 1956.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="23"> Economic progress has provided a means of emancipation which is far from negligible.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="24"> When a new law in 1973 allowed joint ventures to be established for the first time in Tunisia with offshore tax status, a string of factories set up across the country, giving many young women their first taste of freedom.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="25"> The simple act of walking to work a few hundred yards from home, away from the all powerful mother, broke many taboos.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="26"> These women were not well paid but what little they earned allowed them to build up a dowry and gain a measure of freedom in choosing their husband.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="27"> Once married, many were able to claim help from the state to buy a flat.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="28"> Women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in industry, 22 per cent of jobs in the growing services sector, 40 per cent of jobs in agriculture, where they manage nearly 10 per cent of all farms.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="29"> They are present everywhere, seldom veiled, and give Tunis and other major towns a strong Mediterranean feel.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="30"> Last year's laws are ahead of the social mores of many Tunisians, yet they also reflect the fast changing attitudes affecting many sectors of society.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="31"> About ten per cent of new companies are created by women, according to Aziza Dargouth, who runs the Cabinet de Prospective Sociale consulting agency.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="32"> Hayet Laouni had her first job as secretary in a shipping company, 26 years ago, after training to become a primary school teacher.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="33"> She now owns and runs Stumar, a company with turnover of Dollars 3m and is active in stevedoring, conveyancing and forwarding.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="34"> She concedes it has not been easy for a woman to win acceptance in such a milieu, but as she moves around her office, cigarette in hand, firing orders, inquiring whether a particular container has arrived, the feeling Tunisia is undergoing a quiet revolution is overwhelming.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="35"> Sarah Sahdallah owns and runs a porcelain factory, Ibtissem Kamoun has become one of Tunisia's largest producers of ice-cream, Rashida Rouissi exports fruit and vegetables.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="36"> Scores of others are involved in textiles, ice cream and software.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="37"> Such people would not quarrel with the policy of the Minister of Education, the highly respected Mohammed Charfi, who is having references in school text books that men are superior to women and adulterous women be stoned expurgated.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="38"> The books of Hassan El Banna, the founder of modern fundamentalism, have been withdrawn from schools and public libraries.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="39"> To western critics of such moves, many Tunisians point out that wealthy Saudis have, for the past two decades, been subsidising the printing and distributing of books offering the most conservative interpretation of Islam.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="40"> Why should they be criticised for trying to promote more liberal views?</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="41"> Educated Tunisian women are well aware that some of their sisters support al Nahda.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="42"> They agree with attempts to liberalise the economy and are convinced economic growth and a more broadly liberal society are the only serious ways to fight radical Islam.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3422" num="43"> They are fearful of the possible spillover effects of events in neighbouring Algeria and Egypt.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="12"> In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and to foster misogynist beliefs.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="13"> Yet, women in one Muslim country after another, many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight and die for their beliefs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="14"> Those early Western-inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and custody rights, appear to be dead.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="15"> In their place have emerged widespread demands to return to Islamic roots, to rescind foreign-inspired legislation, to reintroduce Islamic sharia law, to re-segregate educational systems.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="16"> And everywhere, women appear in the forefront of a movement to return to a seemingly outmoded way of life, one that restricts their activities and limits their choices.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="17"> Minou Reeves seeks to explore the reasons for the resurgence of Islam in the late 20th Century, to explain the baffling paradox of women who freely sacrifice their lives in war, bravely engage in guerrilla attacks, actively take part in combat, yet voluntarily return to the veil, historically a symbol of their exclusion from public life.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="18"> In seeking to uncover the sources of a phenomenon that has baffled and even frightened many world leaders, the author links the resurgence of Islamic traditions to anti-Western attitudes, whose roots lie in centuries of confrontation between the West and the Islamic world, and more recently in "anti-colonialist" and "anti-imperialist" sentiments born of post-World War II experiences with foreign powers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="19"> She outlines the historical development of repressive customs and attitudes toward women in Muslim societies, in spite of Islam's originally liberating and progressive tenets.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="20"> She delineates the absorption into Islam of such pre-existing local customs and practices as veiling and polygamy, showing how obscurantist exegetes reinforced the misogynistic attitudes of patriarchal societies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="21"> She follows the emergence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Muslim reformers in Egypt and Tunisia who objected to misogynistic interpretations of the Koran and the hadith (the sayings of the prophet Muhammad).</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="22"> She touches upon early 20th-Century reforms in such countries as Tunisia, Iran and Turkey, which resulted from attempts at modernization inspired by Western models.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="23"> She sees feminism within the broader framework of nationalist and socialist tendencies of the time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="24"> The major contribution of this book lies in the author's sketching of the larger historical and political framework for today's Islamic revival and in making it clear that the resurgence of Islam cannot be understood outside of the nationalist revival.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="25"> The author has tackled a large and complex subject and has managed to weave together many strands into a comprehensible and valuable whole.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="26"> A narrower focus, however -- on Iran alone -- might have made this an even more valuable book.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="27"> The author has spread herself thin by attempting to cover too much.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="28"> Although she singles out Iran as the major moving force behind the Islamic revival, in touching on events in a number of other Muslim countries she neither does justice to them, nor to Iran.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="29"> Had she concentrated exclusively on the Iranian revolution, the author might have succeeded in exploring the resurgence of Islam in far greater depth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="30"> She might, for example, have examined in more detail -- and with actual anecdotal accounts -- the difficulties that a tradition-bound and underdeveloped country such as Iran faced when trying to compress several hundred years of modernization into one or two decades.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="31"> She might have explained what cultural aspects of Western culture have been so offensive to Muslim sensibilities as to have provoked violent rejection.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="32"> She might have recounted, through the testimony of those who lived through the revolution, what it was like to have experienced the trauma and the chaos of those times.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="33"> She might have studied, through the words of Iranian religious leaders (many of whom are at odds with one another), the unresolved conflicts over national goals, philosophy, and identity that continue to plague Iran and that, at a deeper level, were to some degree responsible for the force of the explosion that rocked this ancient land.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="34"> Furthermore, by limiting her sources to published documents, the author, in the end, does not succeed in leading the reader across the cultural barriers to see events as an insider.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="35"> Despite these shortcomings, however, this book is a much-needed corrective to the paucity of objective information available to Western readers on the subject of Muslim women.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="36"> It goes a long way toward combatting much disinformation, as well as misinformation, on the Muslim world in general and its women in particular.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0004" num="37"> Finally, writing as she was at the height of Iran's xenophobic anti-Westernism, the author could not have foreseen the current trend in Iran toward moderation and pragmatism, as exemplified by the ending of the Iran-Iraq war.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="6"> Many Tunisians regard a group of laws which, in 1956, abolished polygamy and gave their womenfolk rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world, as one of their country's proudest achievements.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="7"> The 'Personal Status Code' is arguably former President Habib Bourguiba's greatest single achievement.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="8"> The rights granted to Tunisian women have been further consolidated since Mr Zine El Abidine Ben Ali became president in 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="9"> The efforts to promote education, health and family planning have produced clearly visible results - population growth is down to 1.9 per cent a year and two-thirds of all Tunisian women are now literate.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="10"> Furthermore, women are increasingly visible in a wide variety of professions - in teaching, medicine, architecture and in factories as workers, engineers and managers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="11"> Today, women have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of jobs in industry and 40 per cent in agriculture.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="12"> Increasingly, they own and manage new businesses.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="13"> A minor revolution is afoot as the number of new companies founded by women in Tunisia has risen from 7 per cent of the total in 1985 to 13 per cent this year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="14"> Most of these companies are small, with less than 10 employees, but others are much larger and often engage in international trade in a manner which was quite unthinkable only a decade ago.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="15"> It does not come as a surprise that 73 per cent of all companies owned by women are found in the textile sector.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="16"> That is true in other developing countries but the quality of some of what is produced in this sector and the sheer size of some investments points to change.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="17"> Leila Boufaid, whose husband is a senior magistrate, started a small luxury braid business 20 years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="18"> Today, she employs 200 workers, has a turnover of Dollars 1.8m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="19"> Around 90 per cent of its output is exported to Europe and the US.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="20"> Maille Fil which opened in 1989 is a Dollars 20m investment by Hedi Bouchamaoui for his four daughters, two of whom manage Tunisia's largest combed cotton and yarn production plant.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="21"> The company imports cotton from the US and produces 3,000 tons of high quality fabric a year, 75 per cent of which is exported.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="22"> While two daughters oversee the factory, the others are completing their studies at university in Michigan.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="23"> Meanwhile, women in Tunisia are now branching out into other spheres of business.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="24"> Saida Mechri worked in a security company after gaining a degree in economics in Belgium.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="25"> In 1988 she started her own company, Securitap, which employs 800 people, 700 of whom are security agents hired out to embassies and companies across the country and boasting an annual turnover of Dollars 1.7m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="26"> More recently she started a haute couture business which employs 10 designers and sells styles to Italy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="27"> She readily confesses that the company, called Tosca, is her 'true love'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="28"> There are other diverse examples of successful women in business.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="29"> Hayet Laouani, for instance, started as secretary in a shipping company, 20 years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="30"> Now she owns and runs Stumar, a company with a turnover of Dollars 3m and is active in stevadoring, conveyancing and forwarding.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="31"> Rashida Rouissi is a leading exporter of citrus products and is doing battle with the Marseilles suppliers who have a tight grip on the bulk of Tunisian exports, especially citrus fruit, 89 per cent of which was, until recently, shipped through the French port.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="33"> Her battle is not merely with Marseilles shippers but with well-established Tunisians who have lived comfortably off their links with the French port.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="34"> Alya Heda runs Opalia, a joint venture with an Italian businessman which makes pharmaceutical products under licence from Alfa Wasserman and Amuchina of Italy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="35"> Among the hundred doctors and pharmacists who work for her, eighty are women.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="36"> Pharmaceutical exports to African countries are flourishing and she hopes soon to break into the European market.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="37"> Selma Rekik is the financial controller of the Chebika Group, owned by her father and brothers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="38"> Among the group's key activities is the manufacture of electrical items for cars - Peugeot, Renault, Mercedes and Opel are clients.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="39"> She has recently acquired a 40-year lease on a former state farm, the Stifen domaine, north-east of Tunis and is busy developing rich farmland where earlier lack of investment over a generation all but ended production.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="41"> Like other women entrepreneurs, she started in business after marrying and raising children; her husband is one of Tunisia's leading ophthalmists.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="42"> A study conducted last year by Aziza Dargouth, who runs the CPS consulting agency, suggests that 48 per cent of women who start their own business find little difficulty in reconciling their professional and family obligations, that 43 per cent ventured into such activities for the sake of the challenge it offered, that only one husband in five is opposed to his wife's activities.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="43"> Such findings do not conform to a widespread European stereotype of Arab women.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="44"> This new breed of innovative women owner-managers work hard, often more diligently than menfolk and is prepared to do battle with the civil service which, despite the efforts to liberalise the management of the economy launched in 1986, remains a worthy successor of its Turkish and French forebears.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2863" num="45"> A Tunisian businesswoman jokes that edicts of the central bank are 'as difficult to interpret as the Holy Koran itself. . . and spawn quite as many hadiths (the body of comments on the Koran)'.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="6"> Amid all the controversy surrounding the United Nations Population Conference in Cairo, the example of one small Moslem country, Tunisia, traditionally tolerant and open to western influence, suggests the emancipation of women has been a significant factor in reducing population growth from 3.2 per cent a generation ago to 1.9 today.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="7"> Vastly improved standards of education and health care are other ingredients which explain Tunisia's steady economic performance in recent years.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="8"> Real growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1989 and inflation is running at a little over 3 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="9"> Over two-thirds of all households own or are buying a house or apartment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="10"> The successful implementation of a structural readjustment programme has, since 1987, won plaudits from both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and contributed to the resilience of the economy in overcoming the impact of the Gulf War and, last winter, a severe drought.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="11"> The tourist sector is attracting 2.5m Europeans this year and contributing an estimated Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) to exports of goods and services.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="12"> Most striking is the coherence of the 'Personal Status Code', promulgated by former president Habib Bourguiba in 1956, the year Tunisia gained independence from France, which abolished polygamy and established all the laws governing family planning, divorce and the education of women which have given Tunisian women rights not enjoyed elsewhere in the Arab world.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="13"> In 1963, free prescriptions of the pill and free confidential advice on contraception were made available to women, 10 years before France.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="14"> The programme spread to even the smallest village.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="15"> The birth rate has declined from 45 to 24.4 per 1,000, mortality from 15 to 6.1 per 1,000.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="16"> Illiteracy has been cut from 87.7 to 35 per cent, though the figure is higher among women in poorer areas.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="17"> Women are increasingly visible in teaching, medicine and architecture, in factories as workers, engineers and owners.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="18"> The world of politics remains very much a man's world, although the professional skills and sureness of touch which Mrs Neziha Mezhoud, minister in charge of family issues, and a growing number of other highly-articulate women bring to their jobs, suggests it is only a matter of years before senior cabinet posts will go to women.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="19"> Though leaders of the opposition Islamic al Nahda (Renaissance) party have said they would accept many of Mr Bourguiba's policies, women are mindful of the often violent record of some supporters of the party, notably the throwing of acid in the faces of university students on the campus in Tunis.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="20"> Many Tunisian women are convinced radical Islam is not sympathetic to the idea of equality between the sexes or to their presence in public places.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="21"> The laws on divorce and alimony are remarkably close to their European counterparts.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="22"> Indirectly, they allow women a far greater share of inheritance than the Koran allows.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="23"> To bolster these moves, the books of people such as Hassan el Banna, the founder of modern fundamentalism, have been withdrawn from schools and public libraries, and references to the inferior status of women erased from all school books.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="24"> Women today have 25 per cent of all jobs in Tunisia, 35 per cent of all jobs in industry, 22 per cent in the growing services sector and 40 per cent in agriculture, where they manage 10 per cent of all farms.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="25"> Ten per cent of all new companies are created by women.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5141" num="26"> The cycle of emancipation, education, public presence, most notably in the workplace, success in the professions and industry helps to explain why a country of such slender natural resources has progressed so much faster, not least economically, than many of its peers in the Middle East and Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="6"> Despite an active education and prevention programme, the number of reported acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids) cases continues to rise in Uganda.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="7"> The level of HIV infection varies from 5 per cent in rural areas to 38.5 per cent in some main-road trading centres and towns.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="8"> The government's Aids Control Programme recorded more than 42,000 cases of full-blown Aids by the end of 1993, although the figures do not represent the true extent of the epidemic.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="9"> The Federation of Ugandan Employers, which sponsors an Aids prevention programmes in the workplace, says peer-group education has had a significant impact in promoting the use of condoms.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="10"> On the other hand, recent medical studies suggest public health campaigns are unsuccessful.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="11"> One research programme in the Rakai district of western Uganda revealed that 3 per cent of respondents who were free of infection in 1989 had become HIV positive a year later.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="12"> The respondents knew about the Aids menace, and yet many of them admitted to having multiple sexual partners.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="13"> In addition to the universal problem of persuading people to alter their sexual behaviour, Uganda faces particular difficulties in fighting Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="14"> The widespread practice of polygamy, and the low status of women (who, in many rural areas, still kneel before men when they meet) give women little control over their own sexual health and that of their partners.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="15"> 'Much of the preventive education of the west is not applicable in Uganda,' says Ms Marble Magesi of Taso, a Ugandan counselling service for Aids sufferers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="16"> 'What does monogamy mean to a man who already has three wives'?</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="17"> The influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes the use of condoms to prevent the disease, has not helped educators in the populous west and south of the country, where Aids infection is most widespread.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="18"> In addition, it is feared that the demobilisation of soldiers will also spread the disease, as the rate of HIV infection in the army is believed to be higher than 50 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="19"> The government's Aids control programme admits it can do little to help adults who have already contracted the disease.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="20"> But it is placing special emphasis on educating children between the ages of five and 15 to keep them free from disease.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="21"> But already, statistics show that young girls in the 15-19 age group are six times more likely to be Aids carriers than boys of the same age.</s>

<s docid="FT942-4193" num="22"> Part of the explanation is that men increasingly prefer young sexual partners on the assumption that they are free from infection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="18"> Tatimov, the people know you well as a scientist who has carried out a great deal of research, in spite of your youth, with the future of your nation and its prosperity in mind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="19"> They also know you well as a social activist who has never softened his valuable suggestions but has expressed them directly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="20"> I would like to begin our "discussions" with your own family.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="21"> [Tatimov] In general, I think it a mistake to become involved with a man's personal life in the pages of the press and to belabor it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="22"> However, it is possible that the thought has emerged from time to time that since I have been a demographer "we should see what kind of contribution this scientist is making to his own demographics in practice".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="23"> My first wife and I did not get along at all and we divorced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="24"> The name of my wonderful mate of the present is Mayra.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="26"> She is a graduate of the Moscow Cultural Institute, and is a doctoral candidate and an assistant professor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="27"> I am the father of five children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="28"> My oldest child is a girl, 23 years-old, a student.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="29"> Kenzhem, my son, is nine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="30"> He is a student in the third grade of School No. 141 in Almaty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="31"> During my youth I traveled a great deal in various parts of the republic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="32"> When my comrades, living in the four corners of the republic, saw a round yellow baby resembling me they decided it was "my child".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="33"> "There is nothing shameful in words of greatness".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="34"> (Tatimov was joking).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="35"> My wife did not think I was too eager.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="36"> However, she was educated and I wanted to understand her.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="37"> Thus, even if we were not totally in agreement about everything, we made our peace, came to understand one another, and are living a good life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="38"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Since we have begun to establish state relationships with foreign countries, our kinsmen, who were forced to migrate due to past blows of fate, have begun to return.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="39"> Among them there are many who, taking the view that "it is better to be a slave in one's own country than a sultan among foreigners," have returned once and for all in spite of our grave economic conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="40"> What kind of a contribution will such individuals make to the growth of our people's numbers?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="41"> [Tatimov] Indeed it is true that a great caravan of migration has begun to flow into our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="42"> Our kinsmen were forced to leave their country far behind, throwing their fates to the winds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="43"> They encountered oppression from conservatives at the time of the civil war, were annihilated by leftist persecution at the time of Goloshchekin, and were alarmed by racist oppression during the era of colonialism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="44"> For a time we blackened the reputation of these innocents, but now a just political evaluation is being assigned, and we are not being sparing in our help to all of those expressing a desire to "return" to their native land in spite of the fact that our sovereign country is itself barely on its feet.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="45"> This process is going forward with the direct support of the government and the president.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="46"> I am one of those directly responsible for beginning what is in truth the last great migration, for its proper management, and for its timeliness.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="47"> The Ministries of Labor, of Foreign Affairs, and of Internal Affairs are involved with such problems as the settlement of our kinsmen returning from abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="48"> One in three of our kinsmen in Mongolia, that is to say, more than 50,000, have returned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="49"> We may say that the caravan has started and has taken the road.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="50"> This great caravan will be continued from still other countries...</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="51"> Kazakhs living in Tajikistan became refugees last year due to the effects of the civil war started by religious extremists.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="52"> Our president has given them great assistance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="53"> Food, clothing, and drugs have been delivered by special trains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="54"> Some 6,000 of the 9,000 Kazakhs in Tajikistan have been evacuated simultaneously on the trains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="55"> Some 1,200 families have been resettled in Southern Kazakhstan Oblast, primarily in Zhetisay Rayon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="56"> At the time of the 1990 Osh Incident, I was in Qorghantobe Oblast, in Qolkhozabat Rayon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="57"> At that time I advised our kinsmen in that area to return quickly to their country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="58"> Most listened to what I had to say, but some seemed to want to continue to think about it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="59"> Resources were adequate to evacuate them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="60"> Those remaining behind, who did not migrate, regretted it and in the end had to be removed involuntarily at the time of the civil war.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="61"> Thus, there were also losses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="62"> In general it is a good thing to listen to experts thinking about what to do in such questions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="63"> New focuses for migration have emerged.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="64"> By the end of the year, a total of 7,000 persons, 1,000 families from Iran and 400 families from Turkey, will migrate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="65"> A new Migration Department is now carrying out preparatory work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="66"> The heads of this department, Ghaziz Yesmuqanov, Pamir Kameldiyev, and Nurlan Ralqymzhanov, are doing a great deal of work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="67"> First of all, they are planning to evacuate military refugees who deserted at the time of the war in Afghanistan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="68"> This is because they are citizens of no country, lack employment, suffer from poor living standards, and, for that reason, should be returned to Kazakhstan quickly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="69"> The proverb states: "it is difficult to begin a trek".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="70"> If we understand how to be humane by creating favorable conditions for those coming for the first time and for those now leaving, I think that the 15,000 Kazakhs still remaining in Iran and the 25,000 in Turkey will want to return to their homeland.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="71"> Our "butter-heals" from Iran will primarily find a place to live in warm Southern Kazakhstan Oblast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="72"> The reason is that we cannot send those coming from warm climates to places where the weather is severe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="73"> They might not become acclimatized there!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="74"> There is something which must be said here: we are predisposed not to like but to hate Kazakhs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="75"> Instead of taking our countrymen who have come from foreign countries into our midst and making them our kinsmen, we accuse them by saying: "Oh!, are we to take this to mean that you have not forgotten Kazakh customs?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="76"> You say one thing and do another".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="77"> We call those returning from Mongolia "Mongols," and those come from Turkey, "Turks".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="78"> Those come from Europe we accuse for their inability to speak Kazakh at all.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="79"> There are now those who assign guilt because we accept some people who do no work at all.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="80"> Instead of acting like this and looking for problems, I can say that if, above all, we make it possible for them to support themselves, and help them to get used to the new country, everything will be fine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="81"> I do not know whether or not you understand, my dear, when I call our foreign countrymen "butter-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="82"> I have my reasons for calling them this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="83"> What have your Kazakhs not experienced!?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="84"> During the time of the "Lake Alqa flight" [Dzungarian invasions], they put one foot behind the other [in the snow] and became "white-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="85"> During the era of colonialism they suffered oppression as "yellow-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="86"> During the time of the civil wars they wandered as "black-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="87"> During the time of Goloshchekin they suffered slaughter as "red-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="88"> There is the wise teaching of our forefathers that "there is a good side to every difficulty".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="89"> In fact, there must be good sides to each of these four difficulties.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="90"> The first good side, I think, is that our kinsmen who have gone to foreign countries have returned as "butter-heals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="91"> They will make a contribution to the flourishing of our nation with their work, goodness, honorable intentions, and experience in the school of life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="92"> It is well-known that "butter-heal" immigrants are those who have made countries such as America, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, and Canada flourish and develop.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="93"> Similarly, three million of the "butter-heals" resident in foreign countries will make a major contribution to the flourishing and enrichment of our sovereign nation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="94"> For that reason, we must put our white tablecloth on the table before them and we must assemble them together in our black yurt called Kazakhstan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="95"> We have mentioned the migration which we have recently organized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="96"> We have observed other, disorganized elemental migration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="97"> There are also many who have returned to their native country with their own resources, or by force.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="98"> Thus, 20,000 people came last year from Russia, 14,000 from Uzbekistan, and 6,000 from other republics, 40,000 in all.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="99"> All of these migrants will have a favorable influence on the exhausted ethno-demographic shape of our republic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="100"> Something else which I would like to mention: I think that, God willing, and if the world does not end, a new campaign will begin in the new future to move gradually local people remaining behind in the ecological disaster of the Aral to northern oblasts and rayons which are ecologically healthy but are still weak in their ethno-demographic structure.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="101"> This would comprise, first and foremost, Aral, Qazaly, and Shalqar rayons which remain in the disaster area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="102"> Later, if possible, we will have to take up the question of returning our kinsmen living in Karakalpakistan to the motherland.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="103"> That migration would occupy a particular place in the ethno-demographic development of Kazakhstan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="104"> According to my calculations, if we were to move at least half of the 600,000 of our Karakalpak kinsmen living in the vicinity of the Aral in an organized manner to the recently mastered regions, that alone would change the ethno-demographic shape of Northern Kazakhstan in our favor in a fundamental way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="105"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Children were once many in the families of Kazakhs who knew how to repeat the proverb: "a house with children is a bazaar, a house without children a dry graveyard".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="106"> It has been said that the number of large families has been on the decline in recent years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="107"> What kind of evidence can you offer in regard to this?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="108"> [Tatimov] This question is one which is dear to my heart and well known to me.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="109"> Since I understand the question well, I have been endeavoring to instill demographic thoughts and traditional attitudes into the minds of Kazakh women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="110"> Facts from my own research are offered in my book, "Tale of the People or Numbers and Thought," and in my recently published eighth book "Kazakh World (How Many Kazakhs Are there?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="111"> When and Where Have Kazakhs Been Driven Out?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="112"> When and Where Have They Been Oppressed, Shot")?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="113"> These two books must still have not reached readers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="114"> The first copies of the first book were put into the pockets of those attending the World Conference of Kazakhs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="115"> The book is still not on sale and may never be on sale!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="116"> The second book has only recently been published with a run of 60,000 from the "Ata-Mura" Press headed by an intellectual called Muqtar Qulmukhametuly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="117"> For that reason, let me repeat these facts again for Kazakh women from what is in this book: according to the 1926 Census, each married Kazakh women had on the average 10 children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="118"> After that the birth rate abated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="119"> The reasons for this were the deterioration of the health of the people, hunger, and Russian settlement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="120"> It could be said that the Russians had a role.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="121"> Russian women at that time too took good care of themselves and did not have large families.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="122"> Was not this characteristic of theirs beginning to infect Kazakh women?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="123"> In 1959 the number of births per woman had fallen to seven.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="124"> However, since infant mortality decreased along with the birthrate, a demographic wave, a new explosion appeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="125"> The reason was that, whereas women had previously borne 10 children while only one or two or survived, now only one or two of seven children died and five-six lived to maturity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="126"> Thus a demographic explosion was created.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="127"> This was a general process taking place worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="128"> Kazakhstan made its own contribution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="129"> The demographic wave lasted until the 1970s.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="130"> According to 1989 census information, the high birthrates of recent times had strongly declined, and we were near a three child threshold.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="131"> Thereby we approached a level of two children in the cities and of four children in rural areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="132"> This must give Kazakh women a great deal to think about.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="133"> In particular, the market place was exerting a negative influence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="134"> While the birthrate continued to decline, the number of children given birth by Kazakh mothers in absolute terms stayed more or less the same.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="135"> The fact that this year the number of children given birth to by Kazakh women in the republic will be in the vicinity of 202,000-205,000 is only because the demographic structure of our people is young.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="136"> The reason is that those born during the period of the demographic explosion now have families and are bringing children into the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="137"> I emphasized in an interview given to the newspaper ZHAS ALASH the need to struggle for a fourth child.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="138"> The reason is that if the first child is a son, it replaces the father, and if a girl the mother, and the second child simply replaces the parents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="139"> The third child compensates for our various deficiencies, those not marrying and old maids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="140"> Thereby we maintain our numbers at a set level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="141"> It is the fourth child which provides growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="142"> I myself am the tenth and last child of my father and the last child of my mother, the fourth son.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="143"> But for such Kazakh characteristics of my parents, I would not have come into the world in 1940, just before the war, during the last difficulties of a time of persecution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="144"> If that was so, who would be now talking to you here about demographics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="145"> (Tatimov laughed loudly when he said this).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="146"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] One of the questions which you have raised and which has gained the attention of the nation during the last two or three years is getting one or two children from women who are still young but have not found mates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="147"> For this purpose they become junior wives or second wives to men who already have senior wives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="148"> There are many who are against this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="149"> Have you now changed your support for this policy?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="150"> [Tatimov] No!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="151"> This is a very complicated question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="152"> It should not be oversimplified in this manner! A Kazakh has said: "the most difficult struggles are the struggle for land and the struggle of widows".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="153"> However, today the struggle of those "old ladies" must be more difficult than any.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="154"> It would not be too much to devote an entire interview just to that question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="155"> Let me first of all tell who these "old ladies" are and provide an explanation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="156"> That is because some go on about "old ladies," "old ladies," but do not know who they are.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="157"> "Old ladies" are those of the female sex who are over 25 but not yet 50, who have never married, never established a household, and have had no children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="158"> In developed countries an expression like [Kazakh] "old ladies" is altogether absent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="159"> Kazakh women fear gossip and remain in their inappropriate state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="160"> Today they cannot extricate themselves from their dilemma.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="161"> My advice is as follows: let us get a child or so from them all.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="162"> This "severe" advice may seem a little coarse to others but life proves that it is correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="163"> Is not becoming a mother and loving a child better than living alone?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="164"> When we realize that most of today's "old ladies" are office workers, [we know that] they live in front of people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="165"> For that reason, they fear malicious words.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="166"> In my opinion, it is criminal for them to waste their lives because people gossip.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="167"> There are at present 110,000 "old ladies" among the Kazakhs and if they had only one-two children this would bring a generation of 220,000 into the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="168"> Just like the proverb: "a voracious horse is no good horse," to be called an "old lady" is no honor for a woman.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="169"> The words of the people are one thing, the laws of life are another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="170"> There is no need to issue a special law on the taking of two wives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="171"> It would be proper if this question were decided with the participation of the mosque.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="172"> All we have to do is to drop Article 208 of the "Law on Marriage and the Family".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="173"> It is stated there that taking two wives is forbidden.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="174"> According to my research, no one has been brought to trial on the basis of that law since the war; that is to say, this law is entirely ineffective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="175"> Thus we must drop a dead law which no longer functions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="176"> After that, as the Russians say, "we can do anything which is not forbidden".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="177"> I know that some people do not agree with my views on "old ladies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="178"> That is to be expected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="179"> Everyone will not agree with every suggestion that is made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="180"> There will be proponents and opponents of every innovation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="181"> That is life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="182"> I know well that when I first made this suggestion that there would be opposition and that my opponents would primarily be those women supporting a false emancipation who are literate and who think themselves equal to their husbands (some times even superior).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="183"> Moreover, they indeed came out against me and we were unable to cast light on this vital question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="184"> Only when this has been done can we cautiously approach this question as impartially possible and in a serious manner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="185"> It would be proper for us to look at the issue in such a way that no one is insulted and no one's feelings are hurt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="186"> Those in favor of polygamy, in order to back up their position, make the point that Kazakhs formerly practiced polygamy and that this ancestral custom must be renewed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="187"> I am a supporter of limited polygamy but have no desire to present deceptive evidence in support of my views.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="188"> As shown by the 1897 census, only three-four percent of the Kazakh men of the time had two wives and those with three wives were one in a thousand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="189"> Thus, if our women who have remained unmarried become second wives to around four-five percent of all Kazakh men, the problem would thereby gradually be solved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="190"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] It would seem as if another of the ideas which you have advanced, your thoughts on recognizing mothers of large families, has found expression in the presidential edict on this topic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="191"> Thus you are making plans for the carrying out of your suggestions related to the presidential edict.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="192"> When will the day arise when the appropriate mothers get "golden prizes" and "silver prizes"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="193"> In honoring these mothers will only the number of children brought into the world be considered or will there be other measures as well?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="194"> [Tatimov] Indeed, I am making plans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="195"> It will not be long until such prizes are awarded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="196"> Competitions for these gold and silver prize honors are being announced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="197"> Nominations are being reviewed but no selections have been made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="198"> The golden prize will be given to mothers who have borne and raised eight or more children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="199"> In my view, the level should be reduced to seven since the number of mothers with large families is on the decline and the number seven is a lucky number for the Kazakhs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="200"> The words "sufficient" [zhettik] and "adequacy" [zhetistik] have come from the word for seven [zheti] and the ideas of offering seven of something, of preparing seven cakes have arisen from that superstition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="201"> The silver prize will be given to distinguished mothers who have raised five or more children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="202"> However, I have expressed the view that mothers with three children or more should also be included among the ranks of those with large families.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="203"> Likewise, I have offered the suggestion that if there are distinguished mothers who raise and educate still more children, the president himself, or the premier, or the governor of the appropriate oblast or rayon should award them a special prize.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="204"> To be sure mothers who have borne many children, but who have not educated them properly or even abandoned them will not receive such honors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="205"> Far from it!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="206"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="207"> Tatimov, please do not hold it against me if I seem disrespectful and ask a question that is too direct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="208"> You, to be sure, are one of those interested in the growth of you country and in this regard have come out against artificial abortion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="209"> However, who knows better than women the soul and circumstances of women?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="210"> For example, if a husband's income is inadequate to raise and educate five-six children, who gains from the bearing of children who crowd together for a miserable hand-to-mouth existence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="211"> In addition, an era of total destitution such as the present and the ecological environment are having a considerable negative impact upon the health of mothers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="212"> Every other pregnant women is anemic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="213"> It is well known that women with this disease do not bear healthy children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="214"> Thus, it would seem appropriate that the decision in this area to have children or limit a family belong to the family, and to women themselves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="215"> [Tatimov] Indeed, I am opposed to abortion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="216"> You are correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="217"> The decision to limit or not limit the number of children is something which concerns husband and wife equally.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="218"> First the woman and then the man.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="219"> Many women do not take into consideration their husband's views on this question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="220"> This is the reason for the increase in the number of abortions and the use of the loop.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="221"> The man must also participate in determining family sizes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="222"> I think that it would be appropriate in the future to introduce a law that married women must have their husband's permission to get an abortion or to have a loop installed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="223"> In particular, smart women too often think of their own concerns and are having a negative influence on our demographics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="224"> To give numbers, whereas 204,000 Kazakhs were born in Kazakhstan in 1992, during the same year 100,000 abortions were performed in the republic, 50,000 loops were installed, and various other things were done to prevent the birth of children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="225"> As a result, more than half of the children brought to life by Kazakh women, some 250,000, were eliminated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="226"> The number of children who could have been born but were not born exceeded the number of children born.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="227"> We are not saying that families should not be limited.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="228"> Each mother should be concerned about her health.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="229"> However, the fact that 300,000 children of Kazakh women capable of bearing children were voluntarily suffocated and rejected makes my insides seethe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="230"> Is that Islam?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="231"> This leaves aside humanitarian considerations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="232"> Last year 47,000 Kazakhs died.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="233"> Some 300,000 children were born, and, even with the death of 55,000, our people could have gained not 157,000, but 245,000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="234"> We, we ourselves, thus extinguished a substantial 88,000 of our natural increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="235"> There are the lamentations "Black Old Woman," "Black Old Man," "Black Child".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="236"> Leaving their sorrow alone, who is expressing sorrow for the child never born and who feels the loss?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="237"> There is no artist to produce a song about this or to write words.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="238"> The greatest of sorrows is the sorrow of the unborn child.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="239"> I miss them, although I am only a demographer...</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="240"> My words to my daughter-in-law were when she had had a child and was in difficulty because of it: My Kazakh it is said, each child has its own fate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="241"> There is a Kazakh folk saying: "if one extra lamb is born, there will be one more plot of grass".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="242"> I am against limiting families with the excuse that as the market place has gained so much power we cannot support them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="243"> Let me consider each child separately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="244"> The first child is always born for the father and replaces him.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="245"> The second child is born to replace the mother.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="246"> The third child is born to compensate for deficiencies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="247"> The fourth child is necessary for demographic law, for growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="248"> If the fifth child comes to life, it does so for the people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="249"> The sixth child is for the fatherland, for the flourishing of our sovereign country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="250"> The seventh child, that is an honored number, and words which fulfill the desires of Heaven.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="251"> When the eighth child is born, the spirits are satisfied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="252"> When the ninth child is born it satisfies the Muslim Religion, the will of Allah.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="253"> If you say that we are nine children in our home, then your mother and father, Aqqaysha and Qurmanqul, are persons who have satisfied the will of Heaven in the blue sky, of the spirits of the dark earth, and of Allah, the only God.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="254"> I would like to say thanks and express my satisfaction to your mother in particular and thereafter to your father for increasing and making flourish the numbers of the Kazakhs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="255"> As for anemia, this disease is due to dietary and vitamin deficiencies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="256"> For that reason, slaughter a sheep and give it to a woman who has just given birth, just as [one does] before she gives birth, as a qalzha [special food for pregnant women].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="257"> It would be appropriate if the place where she works, or if she does not work, the place her husband works, or the kolkhoz or sovkhoz where the family lives were to provide it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="258"> I think this is something for local governors to think about.!..</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="259"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Let us return to the question of "old ladies" discussed above.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="260"> There are many unmarried men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="261"> In my view, it would seem proper for this issue to find its own proper solution without some special state policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="262"> What new facts and suggestions do you have to offer about this?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="263"> [Tatimov] Some have complained that I talk a lot about the problem of "old ladies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="264"> There are lots of old bachelors, why not pick on them?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="265"> The reason is that women are the fundamental demographic support.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="266"> It is they who increase or decrease the number of people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="267"> For demography, if a man remains unmarried, "with no shame at the words of greatness," if he is impotent, this means nothing since another man will take his place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="268"> However, if a woman does not marry, or remains sterile, or dies, another woman cannot replace her.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="269"> The position of every woman is special in demographics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="270"> If a man dies, this is just one minus for demography.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="271"> However, when a woman leaves the world, we must produce several minuses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="272"> If the woman is young, this means that four children, 12 grandchildren (at three each) from the children, 24 great-grandchildren from the grandchildren (at two each) will not be born.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="273"> For this reason, in demography the problem of 110,000 "old ladies" is more of a problem than 44,000 old bachelors!</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="274"> The reason for the increase in the number of old bachelors is the worsening of ecological conditions in the republic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="275"> Some of the children being born in the environmental disaster areas suffer from impotency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="276"> When we spoke of "old bachelors," we refer to males who have never married between the ages of 30 and 55.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="277"> Recently, I collected statistics throughout the republic on those assaulting [and killing] one another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="278"> Looking at this information, it was primarily men who assaulted [and killed] one another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="279"> Their numbers were three times more than the women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="280"> I wondered if the increase in the number of people killing each other was due to impotence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="281"> This is only a hypothesis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="282"> We must look at the question more deeply.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="283"> Among women there are also "uninterested women" (frigid women), that is women who are not interested in men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="284"> However, they do not kill each other for that reason.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="285"> However, impotency is a great grief for men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="286"> I have stated above that "old ladies" cannot get out of their difficulty on their own, but I repeat that, in addition to the state, the mosque should become involved in this question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="287"> However, our mosques still take a mistaken view of them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="288"> I call this their social "impotency".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="289"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="290"> Tatimov, are there questions which concern you more than others just now as a person who loves his country?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="291"> [Tatimov] Tomorrow I will leave on a trip to Koshetaw.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="292"> My purpose in going there is to carry out preparatory work for transferring there the Migration Department established under the Ministry of Labor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="293"> The reason, as I have already stated, is that the northern oblasts are still weak demographically.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="294"> For that reason we have decided to move this department to Kokshetaw with the aim of preventing such manifestations as separatism, harming our young nation as we change the ethno-demographic shape of the oblasts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="295"> After that I will be in that city to carry out public opinion research on moving the capital to Aqmola.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="296"> As a member of the National Kenges on State Policy, and as a specialist in demographic science, I will be very much involved with making specific suggestions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-61092" num="297"> [Qurmanqulqyzy] Thank you!</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="6"> NAKABUBI'S village was in mourning last month.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="7"> Nobody grieved for the death of yet another Aids victim more than this 31-year-old widow.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="8"> Her husband had already died of Aids, and this latest victim was godfather to her youngest son.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="9"> He had promised to help with school fees.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="10"> Now he is dead, Nakabubi must struggle alone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="11"> Most of the widows in villages across western Uganda have lost their husbands to Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="12"> And in a country were women are regarded as chattels, widows often lose more than just their husbands.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="13"> Another widow, Mabel, was evicted from the family home by her in-laws when her husband died in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="14"> They also sold her cows, 'to pay for my husband's hospital bills'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="15"> When she clung to a small banana plot, her brother-in-law stole the harvest.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="16"> When she, too, fell sick, the same man took her four children away.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="17"> 'If I could only earn a little money,' she says, 'I could get my children back.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="18"> Give them love while I live'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="19"> The southern districts of Masaka and Rakai, once known as the granary of Uganda, bear the heaviest burden of the Aids epidemic outside Kampala, the capital.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="20"> Out of the 38,552 Aids cases reported in Uganda by the end of last year, almost 8,500 were in these two districts.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="21"> Every family knows of a relative or a friend afflicted by the condition.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="22"> Production of the two main cash crops, coffee and bananas, is dwindling because Aids is attacking adults in the prime of life.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="23"> Often, the surviving partner also has the virus and chooses to expend his or her dwindling energies producing food crops for the family's subsistence.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="24"> Health workers in Masaka say the disease is killing what was a thriving market town.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="25"> 'With fewer farmers coming to market, the town merchants are going out of business or cutting their losses by moving to Kampala,' says Mr Elias Mugisha, an Aids counsellor who works for TASO, a Ugandan non-government organisation which cares for Aids and HIV sufferers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="26"> The World Bank, which plans to finance a study on the impact of Aids on the Ugandan economy, estimates Aids-related deaths will reduce Uganda's population growth rate from 3.7 to 3.1 per cent from 1995 to the turn of the century.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="27"> The crude death rate, which at 20 per 1,000 is already twice the average among low-income countries, is likely to rise to 26 per 1,000 during this period.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="28"> The deaths are sapping the strength of Uganda's predominantly rural economy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="29"> 'Agriculture is suffering,' says Mr Keith Muhakanizi, an economist at the Finance Ministry.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="30"> 'As yet, I don't have macro-economic data to sustain this assertion, but a trip to any village will bear this out.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="31"> Cash crops are being abandoned in favour of essential food crops as labour loses productivity'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="32"> Exports of coffee, Uganda's main cash crop, have fallen from a recent peak of 176,453 tonnes in 1989 to 123,883 tonnes last year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="33"> But low commodity prices and bad weather have also contributed to the decline.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="34"> Beyond issues of output and productivity, Mr Muhakanizi says the cost of caring for Aids patients is eating up people's savings, leaving less to invest in economic development.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="35"> Government and non-government organisations report that families resent spending their meagre resources on medication for patients they know will die.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="36"> Where charities try to provide bed sheets and other basic comforts for Aids sufferers, they often find that relatives sell the donated goods to recoup the cost of caring for the patient.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="37"> Aids is also putting an intolerable strain on the extended family network, which is the only form of social insurance most Africans have.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="38"> In Uganda, where annual per capita income is a mere Dollars 167, one of the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, the responsibility for housing, feeding, clothing and educating Aids orphans is often beyond the means of most rural households.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="39"> The problem is not confined to rural areas.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="40"> 'One of our best-trained economists died of Aids last month,' Mr Muhakanizi regrets.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="41"> He says companies are likewise losing skilled workers and can no longer afford to provide medical care schemes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="42"> 'Even our surplus labour will not alleviate the problem in the long run,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="43"> Mr Manuel Pinto, the director of Uganda's Aids Control Programme, has resigned himself to the fact that the disease will continue to be the main killer in Uganda for the foreseeable future.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="44"> 'Aids takes a long time to manifest itself, so we are a long way away from seeing the reversal of the epidemic, or the fruits of our prevention efforts,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="45"> The rate of HIV infection varies from 5 per cent in some rural areas to 30 per cent in urban areas, and according to government data it is still rising.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="46"> 'Children are our window of hope,' Mr Pinto says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="47"> 'We are trying to educate those between the ages of five and 15 so that they are kept free from Aids'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="48"> The problem is compounded by the practice of polygamy and the low status of women in Ugandan society.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="49"> But slowly, Mr Pinto believes, the government is getting its educational message across.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7689" num="50"> Agencies such as TASO report that polygamy in the countryside is on the wane, and that more people are using condoms.</s>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="10"> Kubursi is a Canadian economist who was asked by the United Nations for a study on the never-ending Lebanese civil strife, in a form that economists and bankers could understand.</s>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="13"> Last month he handed in his as-yet unpublished study, a mind-numbing fact sheet with an equally amazing bottom line: In the unlikely event that civil war in Lebanon ended today, it would cost between $25 billion and $30 billion to rebuild the country.</s>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="14"> The figure comes very close to the $33-billion Japanese estimate for the rebuilding of Iran and Iraq after their war.</s>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="44"> "In 1974, the government's expenditure was only 14.9% of the gross domestic product (the total goods and services produced by a country)," Kubursi said.</s>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="45"> "In 1985 this increased to 45.5%, in 1988 to 60.1% -- Lebanon has become a state-run economy, a role it was ill-equipped to play".</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="46"> Unlike the private sector, which adjusted by firing workers, the government had to spend more on things such as subsidies for the imported food, defense and so on.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052889-0040" num="48"> "As a result," Kubursi said, "there was a sharp acceleration of money supply growth arising from the Central Bank financing of the government deficit -- a euphemism for printing money".</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="6"> JOHNSON AND BOSWELL IN SCOTLAND: A JOURNEY TO THE HEBRIDES edited by Pat Rogers Yale Pounds 25, 330 pages TRAVELLERS, however jaded, usually see the need to enliven their accounts of unfamiliar places with a sense of curiosity and excitement; their attitude is the opposite of that affected by the Matabele emissaries, in Stanlake Samkange's Zimbabwean novel On Trial For My Country, who have been told not to 'keep on saying au] au] au] in amazement'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="7"> On seeing the sea for the first time at Cape Town, one of them remarks simply: 'Ah] Today the river is in flood'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="8"> Dr Johnson, in remote regions, has no hesitation in exclaiming at 'mountains, waterfalls, peculiar manners; in short, things which he had not seen before'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="9"> Johnson and Boswell in Scotland accentuates the drama of travel by supplying two narratives to read alongside each other: Johnson's Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775) and Boswell's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1785).</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="10"> While Johnson is busy observing 'peculiar manners' and the like, Boswell is entertained and elated at being able to view his thoroughly urbanised friend and mentor in an unaccustomed setting.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="11"> The pleasures of this double narrative are evident when the travellers come across their first Highland hut.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="12"> Johnson is full of investigatory fervour.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="13"> Luckily, 'to enter a habitation without leave, seems to be not considered here as rudeness or intrusion'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="14"> 'True pastoral hospitality' prompts the peasant woman inside the hut to invite them to drink whisky.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="15"> As Johnson gathers information, Boswell is sharply aware of the social comedy generated by the situation.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="16"> His companion's interest in primitive architecture prompts him to ask where the woman sleeps, and she answers 'with a tone of emotion, saying she was afraid we wanted to go to bed to her'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="17"> Rather cruelly, they derive great amusement from 'this coquetry of so wretched a being'; each claims banteringly that it is the other who has 'alarmed the poor woman's virtue'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="18"> Some of the narrative tension of the book is, of course, derived from the close - but intermittently combative - relationship between the two men.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="19"> Returning from the Western Isles, Boswell is overcome with apprehension, as he anticipates the meeting between his father, Lord Auchinleck, and Johnson, his surrogate father: 'I was very anxious that all should be well; and begged of my friend to avoid three topics; Whiggism, Presbyterianism, and - Sir John Pringle'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="20"> Johnson periodically annoys Boswell (a lowland Scot) by his rudeness about Scotland.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="21"> At one point, he declares that, until the Union with England, the tables of the Scots 'were coarse as the feasts of Esquimeaux, and their houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="22"> Such analogies with far-flung regions are frequent, and not always disparaging: once the two men reach the Highlands, they both excitedly compare the scenes before them to the wilds of America.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="23"> Boswell finds their visit to one village 'much the same as being with a tribe of Indians', to which Johnson replies: 'Yes, sir; but not so terrifying'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="24"> The desire to leave dull familiarity behind is never expressed here quite as strongly as it is in EM Forster's A Room with a View, when the heroine, in a Florentine pensione, laments: 'It might be London'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="25"> Nonetheless, Johnson seems gratified when his experience of feudal hospitality convinces him that 'the fictions of the Gothic romances were not so remote from credibility as they are now thought'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="26"> His pleasure in new and surprising sights is tempered by a vehement repudiation of fantastic travel literature - the tales of monstrous beings that proliferate in medieval travel narratives, and survive, in the 18th century, in wild speculations about Patagonian giants and other curious phenomena.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="27"> Johnson opposes all such 'credulity', and is resolutely sceptical about the poems of Ossian - works published by James Macpherson in the 1760s, in the guise of translations from a Gaelic epic.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="28"> Delight in novelty, moreover, cannot entirely deaden the awareness that 'to live in perpetual want of little things, is a state not indeed of torture, but of constant vexation'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="29"> Many contemporary travellers to the third world - or to the English countryside on a Sunday - will sympathise with this measured response to the absence of a shop on Skye.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="30"> In some other ways, Johnson's narrative may seem alien to late twentieth-century readers: he feels none of the constraints of tourism, which began to trouble travellers to Italy a few decades later, and his Journey lacks any concept of a Byronic urge to move ever onwards, or to place one's self-identity at risk.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="31"> (Revealingly, he describes with approval how, in ancient Gaul, Caesar came along and 'put a stop to' the engagingly feckless plans of the Helvetians to wander off 'they knew not whither').</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="32"> Boswell's narrative has more in common with contemporary travel writing, simply because it often focuses on the personal feelings of the traveller himself: he describes his fits of gloom, made worse by the experience of being trapped on islands by bad weather.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="33"> Johnson, however, in his resolute pursuit of knowledge, touches on many questions relevant to current debates about cultural difference.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="34"> He is scornful of the moral relativism that justifies any form of human behaviour by showing it to be acceptable in some exotic region.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="35"> Montesquieu, for example, 'to support polygamy' tells you of the island of Formosa, where there are ten women born for one man.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="36"> The trouble with this argument, Johnson cheerfully points out, is that 'he had but to suppose another island, where there are ten men born for one woman, and so make a marriage between them'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="37"> Johnson and Boswell in Scotland provides immensely pleasurable reading; its delights are increased by the thoughtful choice of illustrations, and only slightly marred by the decision to cut Boswell's text, and supply the barest minimum of explanatory notes.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="38"> Within the domains of literary criticism and of history, travel writing is usually appropriated either by old-fashioned anecdotalists, snobbishly preoccupied with the antics of aristocrats, or by proponents of the new critical orthodoxy of colonial studies - which, as it becomes absorbed into established systems of academic deference, is in danger of losing its initial intellectual energy.</s>

<s docid="FT932-3656" num="39"> Accessible and attractive editions of travel writings, such as this, throw open the field to a wider readership, and encourage a more diverse range of approaches.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="6"> FOR the past 18 months public debate about 1492 and all that has dwelt excessively on the guilt that Spaniards are expected to feel over their role in Latin America.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="7"> There is no calm debate about the implications of the discovery of America, simply an insistence that things would have been better all round if on October 13, 1492, after a day's rest on the island which he called San Salvador, Columbus had simply turned round and gone home.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="8"> However, the Spaniards who found America were motivated by three things that we have never tried to hide - idealism, economic necessity, and a scientific curiosity about geographic theory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="9"> Of course, among the Discoverers there were psychotics worthy of attention by Sigmund Freud as well as cruel and greedy men.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="10"> But there were no professional exterminators.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="11"> It is absurd to assume that Hernan Cortez had genocide in mind as he moved into huge and unknown Mexico with an army of 200 footsoldiers, 15 horsemen and 1,500 friendly Indians.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="12"> In the eyes of the great Aztec Empire, Cortez and his cast must have resembled a line of ants that August of 1519.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="13"> Pizarro did not take many more troops with him to the Peru of the Incas, who numbered 20m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="14"> Reading Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of Cortes' soldiers and the best reporter of the times, the Discoverers seem like wide-eyed Indiana Joneses, constantly amazed by new worlds, new cultures and new adventures.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="15"> And how quickly they did their work.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="16"> By 1550, only 58 years after Columbus's navigational 'mistake', the American continent had been mapped in detail from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="17"> After Europe it was easily the best documented continent.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="18"> As both technocrats and idealists, the Discoverers knew exactly what they had to do.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="19"> If the hostility of the Mayas, the Incas, the Aztecs or the Carib Indians demanded war, then they fought.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="20"> But their objective was not war but to claim new souls for their God and land and riches for their Kings.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="21"> They were not choosy about the prizes either.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="22"> Gold and silver were valued, but so were Andean llamas, tobacco, tomatoes and potatoes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="23"> And there were no slaves among that booty.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="24"> The Spanish and Portuguese coined a new verb in Mexico and in central and South America - colonizar (to colonise).</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="25"> But it would soon become common usage by the other European powers as well.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="26"> Spain and Portugal, a historian has written, 'sent to America handpicked subjects - not groups of prisoners - who created families, homes and cities and rebuilt there the same laws as in the mother country.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="27"> They went to America because they had found it but also with the blessing of the Catholic Church justifying occupation if it was accompanied by evangelising.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="28"> And in those days to evangelise was to civilise'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="29"> So the Spaniards went, and gave political and administrative identity to their American territories; as a civilising vehicle they used a common language, Castilian, and they educated Whites and Indians in the same schools and universities from the beginning of the 16th century.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="30"> They eliminated polygamy, cannibalism and human sacrifice.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="31"> Spaniards took to America their ways of loving and believing, of hoping, of dreaming and of dying.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="32"> And they did it in the only easy and efficient way - el mestizaje (crossbreeding).</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="33"> Today, 55 per cent of the population of Mexico is mestiza.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="34"> The union, which did not result from wholesale rape, began quickly.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="35"> An Indian woman became Hernan Cortes' closest companion during his Mexican adventure and he is said to have loved her passionately.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="36"> We Spanish do not expect much praise for having invented this humane form of colonisation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="37"> Crossbreeding is, for us, quite natural, and we were not doing anything in America that other peoples had not done for centuries in other places.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="38"> It is easy to criticise October 12, 1492 and its consequences.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="39"> But the Discovery meant the beginning of a new trade route, new colonies and a new cultural frontier.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="40"> For those already there - Mayas, Incas, Caribs and Aztecs -it constituted a great leap forward from Prehistory to Modernity.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="41"> Sooner or later, America would have had to make that leap.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="42"> Many people say that all this history simply boils down to the meeting of two cultures: on the sands of Guahani Columbus and his crews were astonished at the stiff hair of the Indians and, upon seeing them nude, pitied their 'poverty'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="43"> The Indians, for their part, were intrigued by the beards of the Spanish and cut their fingers on their swords.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="44"> Five hundred years later, the cultures of Spain and America still throw up remarkable encounters; a few months ago the foremost conservative leader in Spain, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, was in Cuba, where he embraced Fidel Castro, the last and most recalcitrant exponent of Marxist Leninism in the Caribbean.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="45"> Five centuries after the Discovery, I fully endorse the judgment of the historian Arnold Toynbee: 'I admire the work done by the Spanish Crown and by the Catholic Church in this vast region.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="46"> I admire the Crown for having kept the conquistadores under control.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="47"> The conquistadores were greedy, cruel and revolting.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="48"> They were also brave.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="49"> 'They were, therefore, formidable.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12843" num="50"> And I admire both, the Crown and the Church, for having treated the natives as human beings and for trying to protect them'.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="27"> That is the best you can expect from a dominating party that Hamed Karoui, the prime minister, recently judged to be "the one best qualified to organize the masses," the one in the best position to "manage the change" announced by Mr. Ben Ali on 7 November 1987, when he dismissed Habib Bourguiba from the government "for reason of senility".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="28"> In an understatement, the local weekly REALITES confessed early in March that the RCD "is not yet quite the formation that Tunisia needs for a successful transition to democracy".</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="29"> Setback for Liberties</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="30"> Even though it has begun to recruit younger members into its leadership, the RCD does have to bear the very heavy legacy of the former single party, the Destourian Socialist Party (PSD).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="31"> It is harder to change mentalities than to replace men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="32"> In many regions, leaders of this party-state, of which Mr. Ben Ali is still the chairman, "are relentlessly giving a hard time" to opposition parties, REALITES noted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="33"> The past is one thing; today's reality is another thing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="34"> Paralyzed by the chaos that prevails in Algeria, on the other side of their country's borders, Mr. Ben Ali and his friends are not keen on political openness, as they are convinced that the Islamists of the underground al-Nahdah movement, "preachers of sedition and terrorism," would know how to take advantage of it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="35"> Certainly, Tunisia's antifundamentalist housecleaning was done--with a master's hand, if we may put it that way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="36"> But the government team, always watchful, still uses the "threat from outside" as a pretext to disregard the most elementary humanitarian and democratic principles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="37"> Considering that, according to the RCD political bureau, Mr. Ben Ali "is the only man fit to lead the nation's triumphant march to prosperity and invulnerability," it was inconceivable that anyone else should play opposite him.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="38"> The former president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), the fiery Moncef Marzouki, could therefore not challenge him, not even as a beau geste.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="39"> All were mobilized in favor of the "man of change"; even local journalists, so ill-treated by the government, were forced to support the sole candidate "because they know that he is sowing the good seed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="40"> That political balancing act was far more strange on the part of the legal opposition that was expected to campaign simultaneously for the RCD leader, sole candidate to the highest office, and against candidates of that same RCD running for the Chamber of Deputies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="41"> Mohamed Moada, president of the Movement of Socialist Democrats (MDS), assured Mr. Ben Ali of the "unfailing confidence" of his militants; and Mohamed Harmel, general secretary of the former Communist Party, assured him of the "unanimous support" of his comrades.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="42"> Bread and Security</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="43"> The existence of seven legally recognized parties, more than 5,000 associations, and some 120 publications does not in any way alter the fact that, behind this democratic decor, the power is more than ever concentrated in the hands of one man, surrounded by a handful of advisers, even courtiers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="44"> Everything starts at the Carthage Palace, and everything comes back to it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="45"> Nothing is decided or said without his approval.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="46"> As a result, any "strategy of dialogue" is reduced to its simplest terms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="47"> Many have denounced this autocratic deviation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="48"> Last year, over 200 Tunisian intellectuals and the General Union of Tunisian Students (UGET) deplored "the appreciable setback inflicted on liberties" under the pretext of fighting fundamentalism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="49"> In January, Amnesty International mentioned "the chasm" between what the government says and what it does, citing "serious and systematic human rights violations".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="50"> These accusations, the government said, were "false and slanderous allegations".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="51"> More relevant is the struggle against the "green peril" engaged by Mr. Ben Ali and his friends outside the political field proper.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="52"> For his part, Mohamed Charfi, the minister of education and sciences, organizes it masterfully.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="53"> "It is not social conditions, poverty, destitution that are at the origin of fundamentalist movements," he likes to say.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="54"> "Fundamentalism is generated by the school".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="55"> Therefore, a vast reform of the school system was started, involving a retraining of the teaching body and a revision of programs and textbooks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="56"> As a result, young Tunisians are again studying the author of Candide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="57"> "A student who has read Voltaire," Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="58"> Charfi pointed out, "will never be an Islamist"...</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="59"> Habib Bourguiba already had seriously engaged his country on the road to modernity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="60"> The first birth-control measures date back to 1961; the population growth rate thus dropped to below 2 percent per year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="61"> Thanks to the personal status code that came into force in 1956, Tunisia now finds itself several tens of years ahead of most Arab states as far as polygamy, repudiation, conjugal consent, etc., are concerned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="62"> "In our country," a female Tunis lawyer noted, "the law was ahead of mentality changes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="63"> "The irrevocable choice of free enterprise" is also beginning to bear fruit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="64"> Efforts to achieve "Chinese-like growth"--5 percent per year on the average from 1987 to 1992--caused the emergence of a middle class, although it was also accompanied by a policy aimed at reducing social inequalities, which are far less glaring than at the other end of the Maghreb, in Morocco, a country always so quick to set itself as an example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="65"> Bread and security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="66"> Does that mean that everything is for the best in the best of all possible Tunisian worlds; that, as Mr. Ben Ali claims, this country is "a developed country in every respect"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21482" num="67"> Not so fast: paradoxically, Islamism also feeds on democratic inadequacies, as can be seen in Algeria, where the FLN [National Liberation Front] so thoroughly paved the way for the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front].</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="6"> Locals call it the good news show.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="7"> Each evening television feeds Malaysians a series of generally upbeat items about the state of their country.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="8"> The considerable achievements of the Malaysian economy are the main focus of attention.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="9"> The activities of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, feature prominently.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="10"> But lately the news has been a little more subdued.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="11"> While the economic outlook, in the short term at least, appears good, Malaysians have been puzzled to hear about the government's tough actions against a Moslem group.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="12"> They have been intrigued that talk about a sex scandal involving a senior government figure has been allowed to surface in the official media.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="13"> There have been a series of fires at Kuala Lumpur's international airport and two 'near misses' between aircraft.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="14"> Even the weather forecast looks worrying.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="15"> Some of the worst pollution in years has clouded the skies of much of the Malay peninsula in recent weeks and has led to government health warnings.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="16"> Dr Mahathir and other senior figures in government have made clear signals that a general election will be called soon, possibly at the end of the year.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="17"> There seems very little chance that Dr Mahathir, in power since 1981, will lose his tight grip on power.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="18"> But a degree of flux is evident in Malaysia's body politic.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="19"> In June the government launched its campaign against Al Arqam, a Moslem sect that claims 100,000 followers in Malaysia and many more in the region.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="20"> In early August Malaysia's Islamic authorities banned Al Arqam's teachings, describing them as deviationist.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="21"> Since then the government has declared the sect illegal, launched police raids on the group's communes and carried out a number of mass arrests of followers.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="22"> Many, particularly in the majority Malay Moslem community, question the government's heavy-handed tactics.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="23"> Mr Ashaari Muhammad, Al Arqam's leader, had his passport revoked by the Malaysian authorities while in Thailand.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="24"> Mr Ashaari, along with at least seven followers - including his wife and six-month old daughter - are being held under Malaysia's Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for up to two years' detention without trial.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="25"> The Malaysian Bar Council has protested that the ISA, which usually involves harsh isolation treatment and round the clock interrogations, is being used for purposes for which it was never intended and says Mr Ashaari has been denied the right to legal representation.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="26"> Critics say there are political motives behind the move against Al Arqam.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="27"> They say Dr Mahathir had become worried about the growing popularity of Al Arqam within his own United Malays National Party (Umno), the dominant group in the ruling national front.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="28"> Al Arqam says it is being used as a scapegoat to take attention away from scandals and corruption within Dr Mahathir's government.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="29"> The government says it acted against Al Arqam because the sect had strayed from proper Islamic teachings and could pose a threat to public order.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="30"> Dr Mahathir has made a number of allegations against Al Arqam, including that through the practice of polygamy, the sect treated women as 'little better than prostitutes'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="31"> At the same time and to the deep embarrassment of the government, the case of Mr Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik hit the headlines.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="32"> Mr Rahim is chief minister of the state of Malacca and head of Umno's youth wing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="33"> Mr Rahim is under police investigation after allegations that he sexually abused a 15-year-old girl.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="34"> He has also been accused of accumulating a vast fortune through dubious property deals.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="35"> Mr Rahim is a leading member of a new generation of Umno personalities who came to prominence within the party along with Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and Dr Mahathir's heir apparent, in elections late last year.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="36"> Dr Mahathir has been forced to suspend Mr Rahim from his official posts.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="37"> Mr Rahim was allowed to go abroad on holiday.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="38"> The girl he is said to have abused has been kept under police custody.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="39"> What intrigues Umno watchers is that the allegations against Mr Rahim have been allowed a public airing in the heavily government-influenced media.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="40"> There are suspicions that senior figures in the party might be out to rock Dr Mahathir's political powerboat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="41"> Dr Mahathir faces few problems from Malaysia's weak and divided opposition parties.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="42"> But within Umno there is intense debate about the future direction of the party.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="43"> Many of the Umno rank and file say the party has lost touch with its rural roots and is now dominated by urban-based politicians with close links to the country's corporate elite.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="44"> Some sections of Umno have voiced concern about corruption within the party and a nationwide cult of vote-buying called 'money politics'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="45"> Dr Mahathir has pledged to put a stop to abuses within his own party.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="46"> Economic success has brought a large degree of political complacency to Malaysia.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="47"> But politics has been give a shot in the arm by recent events.</s>

<s docid="FT943-2362" num="48"> The evening news could be more interesting in future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="14"> BFN [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Information Office of the State Council has released a white paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="15"> The full text of the white paper follows:</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="16"> Foreword</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="17"> In March 1992, the United Nations decided to hold in 1995 the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the capital of China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="18"> This has aroused greater world attention on the status of Chinese women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="19"> In the feudal society which lasted several millennia and the subsequent century of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, Chinese women experienced a bitter history of prolonged oppression, degradation and abasement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="20"> From the first half of this century, masses of women plunged into an undaunted and heroic struggle lasting several decades under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="21"> This was a quest for national liberation and their own emancipation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="22"> It was not until the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 that Chinese women, who make up one-fourth of their sex in the world, finally won their historic freedom.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="23"> New China proclaimed that Chinese women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life and that they have become, like all Chinese citizens, masters of the state and society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="24"> Chinese laws guarantee that women and men enjoy the same rights and status and have equal personal dignity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="25"> The Chinese Government employs legal, administrative and educational means to eliminate all kinds of discrimination against women and protect their special rights and interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="26"> Today, as an important token of civilization and progress, Chinese women enjoy the equal rights which had remained unattainable in Chinese society over millennia and which only became accepted in many developed countries after some centuries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="27"> Under the socialist system, the once-stifled wisdom and talents of Chinese women have been released to a great extent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="28"> Women are actively plunging into China's social development as masters of society, becoming a great force in both economic construction and cultural and ideological advances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="29"> They are a vital force in China's reform and opening to the outside world and the modernization drive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="30"> Women have made extremely important contributions in various undertakings, including industrial and agricultural production, science, culture, education and health care.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="31"> In China, the expression "women hold up half the sky" has become the most vivid expression the entire society uses to praise the role played by women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="32"> While women's impetus for social development has been forming, great changes have taken place in their mental outlook.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="33"> They have gained a sense of self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening and have taken long strides forward in their ability to participate in government and political affairs, in their cultural accomplishment, level of scientific knowledge and production skills.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="34"> Chinese women have a glorious peace-loving tradition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="35"> They have never forgotten the calamities caused by aggressive wars and rendered resolute support for the foreign policy of peace adopted by the Chinese Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="36"> No matter what clashes might break out in the world, they always stand on the side of justice and the victims of aggression and oppose violence and aggression.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="37"> Chinese women are an important force in safeguarding world peace.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="38"> Over the past 45 years, especially in the 15 years since the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, Chinese women have achieved truly historic advances toward the goal of "equality, development and peace".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="39"> This great forward march is an important component of the progressive cause of women worldwide; it is also an important part of the progress China has made in human rights.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="40"> China is a developing country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="41"> Owning to the constraints of social development and the influence of old concepts, the condition of Chinese women is still not wholly satisfactory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="42"> There exist various difficulties and resistance which have prevented the full realization of equal rights to women with respect to their participation in political and government affairs, employment, access to education, as well as marriage and family.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="43"> Instances of looking down upon and discrimination against women and even infringement of their rights still occur from time time [as received].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="44"> On the other hand, the overall competence of women remains to be further enhanced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="45"> All these account for the fact that the road toward emancipation and progress for Chinese women has not reached its end.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="46"> The Chinese Government is making every effort to develop the economy, strengthen the legal system, eradicate all backward ideas of discriminating against and looking down on women and promote equal rights for men and women in all spheres of social life as stipulated in Chinese law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="47"> This will speed the realization of the various development goals of the Nairobi strategies [the Nairobi Forward-Looking strategies for the Advancement of Women to the Year 2000] in China before the end of this century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="48"> The Chinese Government, Chinese women and Chinese people as a whole warmly welcome the convocation of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="49"> They are going all out to make comprehensive preparations for the congress.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="50"> To enable the international community to acquire a better understanding of the condition of women in the host country, we have prepared this report for release to the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="51"> Chapter I -- Historic Liberation of Chinese Women In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, women were for a long time kept at the bottom of society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="52"> It was not until the first half of this century that the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to wage a great and profound national democratic revolution on this ancient land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="53"> At the same time, a large-scale women's emancipation movement was launched, resulting in the historic liberation of Chinese women which won worldwide attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="54"> The impact of the several millennia of oppression and devastation imposed by the feudal patriarchal system on Chinese women was exceptionally grave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="55"> In political, economic, cultural, social and family life, women were considered inferior to men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="56"> This was profoundly manifested in the following ways: Possessing no political rights, women were completely excluded from social and political life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="57"> Economically dependent, women were robbed of property and inheritance rights and possessed no independent source of income.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="58"> Having no social status, women were forced to obey their fathers before marriage, their husbands after marriage and their sons if they became widowed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="59"> They had no personal dignity or independent status, and were deprived of the right to receive an education and take part in social activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="60"> They enjoyed no freedom in marriage but had to obey the dictates of their parents and heed the words of matchmakers, and were not allowed to remarry if their spouse died.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="61"> They were subjected to physical and mental torture, being harassed by systems of polygamy and prostitution, the overwhelming majority of them forced to bind their feet from childhood.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="62"> For centuries, "women with bound feet" was a synonym for the female gender in China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="63"> The successive invasions by the Western powers after the Opium War in 1840 aggravated the plight of Chinese women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="64"> In the full-scale war of aggression launched by Japan against China from 1937 on, most of the over 30 million Chinese who were brutally killed were women and children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="65"> Within a month after the Japanese troops occupied Nanjing, they committed over 20,000 rapes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="66"> The cruel oppression and exploitation of the Chinese people by imperialist and feudalist forces as well as bureaucratic capitalism pushed China to the brink of national subjugation and annihilation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="67"> It also plunged Chinese women into an abyss of misery never witnessed before.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="68"> For national salvation and self emancipation, Chinese women, along with the entire nation, waged a dauntless struggle that lasted for over a century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="70"> The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom enacted and promulgated a series of policies on sexual equality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="71"> The Reform Movement of 1898 advocated and ignited the wave to ban feet binding and establish schools for women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="72"> The 1911 Revolution kindled a feminist movement which focused on equal rights for men and women and participation by women in political affairs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="73"> These movements promoted the awakening of Chinese women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="74"> Nevertheless, they all failed to bring about a fundamental change in their miserable plight as victims of oppression and enslavement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="75"> Ever since its birth, the Chinese Communist Party has made the achievement of female emancipation and equality between men and women one of its goals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="76"> Under the leadership of the Party, women were mobilized and organized to form a broad united front with working women in industry and agriculture as the main body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="77"> Women of all ethnic groups and walks of life united to stage popular women's liberation movements closely tied to the Chinese revolution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="78"> In Communist Party-led base areas in particular, the revolutionary political powers issued a series of decrees and regulations to ensure the rights of women and raise their status.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="79"> This brought light and hope to women throughout the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="80"> For the women of China, the founding of the People's Republic of China ended the thousands of years of feudal oppression and enslavement and the history of being trampled and bullied by foreign aggressors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="81"> With an entirely new face, they have stood up and become the masters of New China like all citizens of the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="82"> In 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened in Beijing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="86"> Li Dequan, Shi Liang and some other women were also placed in leading posts in the government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="87"> The Common Program, adopted by the conference which had the nature of a provisional constitution, solemnly declared the toppling of the feudal system which fettered women and stated that women enjoyed equal rights with men in the political, economic, cultural and educational fields and in other aspects of social life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="88"> Thus a new era in the emancipation of Chinese women was ushered in.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="89"> After the founding of the People's Republic, there was a surge of mass movements throughout the country to quickly change the backward economic and cultural outlook left over by old China and eradicate the antiquated system and outmoded customs that fettered, discriminated against and humiliated women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="90"> This effected an earth-shaking historic change in the social status and condition of women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="91"> -- Land reform.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="92"> In old China, poor farmers and farm laborers who accounted for 70 percent of the rural population, owned only 10 percent of the land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="93"> Women had no right to own any land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="94"> In the very early days of the People's Republic, a widespread and profound land reform movement was carried out, in accordance with the principle of distributing land on the basis of the number of members in a family.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="95"> Rural women obtained land, just like their male counterparts, and became masters of their piece of soil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="96"> This fundamentally altered the situation of economic inequality between men and women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="97"> -- Universal balloting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="98"> The Electoral Law of the People's Republic of China promulgated in 1953 clearly stipulated that women enjoy the same rights to vote and stand for election as men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="99"> The subsequent elections conducted at grass-roots levels nationwide in December that year were the first large-scale general ballot in Chinese history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="101"> Among the deputies to the National People's Congress, elected somewhat later, women made up 12 percent, with females accounting for 11 percent of all representatives from ethnic minorities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="102"> This indicates that ever since the founding of the People's Republic, the participation of women of all ethnic groups in state administration has been not only written into the law but also an actual practice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="103"> In some Western countries, only one or two centuries after their founding, did the law stipulate that women had equal voting rights with men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="104"> -- The move out of the home.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="105"> Along with the economic rehabilitation and development, there appeared a nationwide upsurge of women stepping out of their homes to take part in social production.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="106"> In 1957, around 70 percent of rural women engaged in agricultural work, and the number of urban women workers and staff reached 3.286 million, representing a 5.5-fold increase over 1949.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="109"> In old China, as many as 90 percent of women were illiterate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="110"> In order to raise the cultural level of the entire nation, New China launched a planned campaign to gradually wipe out illiteracy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="111"> The mass campaign witnessed three upsurges in 1952, 1956 and 1958.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="112"> Various literacy classes, popular evening schools and workers' spare-time schools mushroomed in both rural and urban areas, and women attended these in their millions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="115"> The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated in 1950, was the first statute enacted by New China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="116"> It clearly declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system characterized by arranged and forced marriage, male superiority and female inferiority, and disregard for the interests of children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="117"> Implementation of the new system was marked by freedom for both men and women in marriage, monogamy, sexual equality and protection of the legitimate rights of women and children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="118"> This signified a profound revolution in the patterns of wedded and family life that had prevailed for several thousand years in Chinese society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="119"> In the months that followed the law's promulgation, a large-scale mass campaign was staged throughout the country to publicize and implement the Marriage Law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="120"> This action resulted in the annulment of numerous feudal engagements, a rapid reduction in wife bashing and maltreatment, and freely chosen love marriages became prevalent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="121"> Through several years of hard work, the shackles imposed upon women by the millennia-old feudal marriage system was smashed and freedom of marriage was basically established.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="122"> -- Ban on prostitution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="123"> Brothels, prostitution and whoring were among the disgusting social phenomena left over by old China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="124"> Immediately after its founding, New China adopted resolute measures to outlaw prostitution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="125"> In November 1949, the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress took the lead in adopting a decision to ban prostitution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="126"> The municipal government immediately closed all brothels and gathered prostitutes in designated places where they could be educated, have their thinking reformed, receive treatment for venereal diseases, and be provided with guidance to help them start normal lives and support themselves through their own work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="127"> Following the example of Beijing, all large, medium-sized and small cities in the country, including Shanghai and Tianjin, waged campaigns to wipe out prostitution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="128"> In a very short period of time, the sale of sex, a chronic social malady that seemed impossible to eradicate in old China and which seriously damaged the physical and mental health of women and degraded their dignity, disappeared, enabling society to take on a brand-new outlook.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="129"> By means of these large-scale mass movements, New China took only a few years to clean up the filth and mire left over from a feudal society that had lasted for thousands of years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="130"> It effected fundamental emancipation for women in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="131"> This represented a significant transformation in the history of contemporary social development that China can be proud of.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="132"> It was also an important contribution made by the Chinese revolution to the worldwide movement for women's liberation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="134"> Women enjoy equal legal status with men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="540"> In the past 15 years, China has sent 280 women delegations abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="541"> Indeed, Chinese women have friends all over the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="542"> China believes that although different countries have different histories and their realities and level of economic development vary, they face some common tasks, similar situation and difficulties with regard to women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="543"> China is ready to establish relations with women of all states to learn from each other so as to jointly improve the situation for women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="544"> In recent years, Chinese women's organizations have jointly sponsored seminars with their counterparts in the United States, Russia, Japan and other countries to study and exchange views on issues that confront women worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="545"> China has taken an active part in international cooperative projects concerning women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="546"> At the request of UNESCO, the Asia-Pacific Development Center and United Nations University, China has undertaken research projects on Chinese women and submitted many reports which have all been well received.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="547"> Over the past decade, the All-China Women's Federation has cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Women's Development Fund, United Nations University, Canadian International Development Agency and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in over 700 projects in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="548"> The schemes include such items as eliminating illiteracy among rural women and providing them with practical technical training, offering vocational training for job-seeking young urban women, training kindergarten teachers, and promoting women's and children's health care and family education.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="549"> Over 300,000 women have taken part in these programs and the results have been outstanding.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="550"> The Assistance for Youth Employment Project has been awarded a special prize by the United Nations Women's Development Fund, and the All-China Women's Federation has been highly commended as an ideal partner for international cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="551"> Support has flowed from China for efforts by developing countries to foster women's participation in economic development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="552"> Since 1980, China has provided 101 batches of material assistance to women's and children's organizations in 50 countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="553"> The provisions included sewing and embroidery machines, cultural and sports facilities, and clothes and toys.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="554"> They have helped vocational training for unemployed urban young women and promoted women's work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="555"> To meet the needs of these countries, China has in recent years dispatched technical groups specializing in straw, flax and corn straw weaving and embroidery to Mozambique, Mexico, Mauritius, Uganda and Ecuador to help raise the production skills of local women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="556"> These contributions have received high praise from the local governments and people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="557"> China adheres to the United Nations theme of equality, development and peace when taking part in international bilateral and multilateral women's activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="558"> In upholding the principle of equality between men and women, China believes this concept concerns not only the interests of women but also the full employment of the wisdom of humanity and total utilization of social productive forces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="559"> Equality is a prerequisite for women's participation in social development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="560"> In March 1985, at the third preliminary session on reviewing the achievements of the UN Decade for Women, the Chinese delegate pointed out, "Equality between men and women has been the goal of the women's movement for a long time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="561"> The United Nations Decade for Women has scored marked progress in legislative equality, but this is not enough...</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="562"> We believe that strategically we must stress that efforts must be made at the international, regional and national levels to work out active plans in order to reach a genuine equality; every governmental and non-governmental organization should provide legal services for women and make it possible for them to adopt legal weapons to protect their legitimate rights".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="563"> At present, political, economic, social, family and racial discrimination against women continue to exist in some countries to varying degrees.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="564"> Hence, a significant narrowing of the gap between law and reality remains an important and arduous task for every government and the international community at large.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="565"> China is convinced that the key to achieving sexual equality is to enable women to take part in development as the equals of men.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="566"> Women provide great momentum for human progress, and without their participation, true progress is not possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="567"> Nowadays, many obstacles still prevent women from fully taking part in social development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="568"> In addition to formulating laws and regulations to ensure the right to equal participation, it is necessary to strengthen women's education so that women's talents are developed and their scientific and cultural standards and management skills can be enhanced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="569"> For historical reasons and as a result of an unfair and irrational global economic order, most of the developing countries suffer from a low level of economic development and backwardness in science and technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="570"> This has seriously hindered women's participation in social and economic development, hence their low social status.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="571"> For this reason, the international economic order should be thoroughly transformed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="572"> Bilateral and multilateral economic and technical cooperation should be developed so that women worldwide, and especially those from developing countries, can enjoy the right to participate in social development as men's equals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="573"> China believes that women are a great force in maintaining world peace, and this is closely linked to the future of our planet and the destiny of the mankind, women in particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="574"> Without peace, development and sexual equality are out of the question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="575"> However, in today's world, acts which go against the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law still exist.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="576"> These include such practices as the big bullying the small, the strong domineering over the weak, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and violating their sovereignty, and armed aggression and occupation of the territory of other states.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="577"> Local wars and regional conflicts have been incessant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="578"> China firmly supports the struggle by women and the entire humanity against external aggression and interference and the efforts to safeguard national independence, promote national economies and women's advancement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="579"> China believes that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="580"> Countries should abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="581"> The internal affairs of a state should be solved by its own people, while international matters should be settled through consultation among countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="582"> Over the years, Chinese women have made unremitting efforts to maintain world peace, and to fight against imperialism, old and new colonialism, hegemonism, racism of various forms, fascism and all forms of terrorism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="583"> As the host country of the Fourth World Conference on Women, China will make positive efforts to ensure its success.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="584"> Since the United Nations accepted the application of the Chinese Government and decided to hold the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995, the Chinese Government has attached great importance to its preparatory work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="585"> In August 1992, the State Council set up an Organization Committee consisting of leaders from 30 relevant ministries, the Beijing municipal government and mass groups to be fully responsible for the preparation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="586"> Chaired by State Councillor Peng Peiyun, the committee stresses that the preparation for the conference should also be used as an opportunity to promote the role of Chinese women in social development and sexual equality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="587"> In March 1993, Chinese Premier Li Peng stressed in the Report on Government Work at the First Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, "We should make the Fourth World Conference on Women a success".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="588"> This is a call to the Chinese people for general mobilization and also a solemn pledge to the international community.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="589"> At present, the Chinese Government is earnestly carrying out its responsibilities as a host country and increasing its contacts and cooperation with UN organizations, governments and relevant non-governmental organizations in the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-25261" num="590"> It is exerting its utmost efforts to facilitate the convocation of the conference and contribute to the global advancement of women.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="20"> Shikhmuradov. In a conversation with an ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent he discusses the foundations of the politics of the young sovereign state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="21"> [Zorinyants] How do you explain the fact that in Turkmenistan, a multinational state, where one could expect internal conflicts, stability still remains?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="22"> [Shikhmuradov] Since the first days of our independence we have proceeded from the conviction that the polyethnic (multinational) principle for formation of the state was more promising, and better grounded than the monoethnic one.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="23"> And we see in this no deprecation of the national dignity of Turkmens.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="24"> We do not shout about the supremacy of any ethnic groups over others and we do not take the liberty of accusing some and turning others into victims.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="25"> Having taken a realistic look at the events of the recent and distant past, we said to ourselves: All that has happened has been both good and bad--that is our history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="26"> And how it will continue now depends on us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="27"> Such a sober view of our own history has now become a foundation for peace and harmony in the society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="28"> Of course the republic leaders still have the right to correct, reasonable, and timely intervention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="29"> And they take advantage of this right.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="30"> Look, for example, at the serious evolution in our legislation of the article on fanning intertribal and interethnic dissension.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="31"> At one time this entailed a small fine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="32"> Now fanning dissension is regarded as one of the gravest criminal offenses and is punished accordingly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="33"> [Zorinyants] And how is the personnel policy structured?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="34"> As far as I know, there have been fewer and fewer non-Turkmens recently, both in the structures of power and among the leaders of enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="35"> [Shikhmuradov] We have no national or, more precisely, nationalistic preferences in personnel policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="36"> A mechanism of appropriateness and occupational suitability is at work here.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="37"> Look at the entire administrative hierarchy and you will see representatives of all peoples.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="38"> And if Turkmens still prevail, that is not surprising; after all, they make up 80 percent of the population.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="39"> [Zorinyants] One gets the impression that the leaders of Turkmenistan have some kind of cautious attitude toward the CIS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="40"> [Shikhmuradov] It seems to many people that the CIS is a new version of the former Union, where there is a single center to which one can turn on any occasion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="41"> This, as we see it, is an incorrect view of it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="42"> In the USSR relations between the Center and the Union republics were always like those of a rider and a horse.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="43"> Two years of experience with the CIS have convinced us that even the most difficult problems in relations among states can and should be resolved in bilateral negotiations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="44"> As we know, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="45"> And the creation under the label of the CIS of any center, a strict coordinating structure, is a third point, which, if it does not distort, at least lengthens this straight line.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="46"> We want to reserve the right to choose what is advantageous and what is disadvantageous based on our own national interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="47"> [Zorinyants] Whose experience would you like to emulate in your reforms?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="48"> [Shikhmuradov] We have studied various models of socioeconomic development and familiarized ourselves with the experience of Turkey, the United States, France, China, India, and Pakistan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="49"> And still we have created our own purely Turkmen model of transition to the market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="50"> It takes into account our country's specific features, its customs and traditions, and even its behavioral stereotypes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="51"> Based on this we have published a program called "10 Years of Well-Being".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="52"> We need 10 years of stability and interethnic harmony in order to conduct the reforms more quickly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="53"> During this period we must solve two problems--simultaneously: building an independent state and changing from a centralized to a market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="54"> And at the same time we shall provide social guarantees for the people so that the difficulties of the transition will not be reflected painfully among the population, as is frequently the case.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="55"> [Zorinyants] Judging from what I have seen, you have not always succeeded at the latter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="56"> The stores are rather empty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="57"> The main food products are bought with ration cards and the prices went up again after the introduction of the national currency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="58"> Therefore let us move from the material sphere to questions of spiritual life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="59"> According to the Constitution, Turkmenistan is a secular state, but the highest representatives of the Muslim clergy participate in the work of all the most important conferences.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="60"> The president of Turkmenistan has issued an edict on studying the fundamentals of religion in school.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="61"> Is this not turning out that the revival of interest in Islam is moving and taking hold at the top?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="62"> And is this not pandering to fundamentalist forces?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="63"> [Shikhmuradov] For many long years our people were physically separated from religion even though it is a part of their spiritual life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="64"> And if the return to Islam seems overly active now, one must allow for what you might call a thirst on the part of a people yearning for their own customs and traditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="65"> The people generate their culture, and religion is a part of it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="66"> As for threats of Muslim fundamentalism, I want to say that Turkmens have never been religious fanatics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="67"> And such a threat does not exist.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="68"> [Zorinyants] Does the return of Islam to the spiritual life of society mean that the traditions associated with it will also be revived: polygamy, bride money, etc.?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="69"> [Shikhmuradov] You are talking about things that are under church jurisdiction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="70"> But in our country it is separated from the state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="71"> Therefore these questions are neither discussed nor resolved at the state level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="72"> [Zorinyants] That is, they are not encouraged and they are not condemned?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="73"> [Shikhmuradov] The main thing is for the activity of religious organizations to be in keeping with the Constitution, and the church has obeyed the laws of the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="74"> This more or less insures us against any extremes, against religious extremism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="75"> [Zorinyants] It is known that you have retained censorship and that there is only one party--the democratic, formerly Communist Party, and the opposition has been banned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="76"> Yet according to its Constitution Turkmenistan is not only a secular but also a democratic state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="77"> So whom should we believe--the Constitution or real life?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="78"> [Shikhmuradov] Our Constitution actually does contain such a stipulation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="79"> But I want to emphasize that we are now at the very beginning of the path to a democratic society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="80"> We are convinced that it is impossible to create a democracy overnight.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="81"> It requires a certain transition period, which we are now going through.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="82"> It is impossible to jump from totalitarianism to a free society in a single hour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="83"> Whenever we begin to agitate the unpoliticized masses, where does it lead?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="84"> The politicians remain sitting in their offices and the people on the streets shed blood.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="85"> It is our duty to spare people from such things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="86"> Therefore the principle of moderation and weighed steps in conducting democratic transformation is fundamental for us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="87"> We are now being accused of not having a multiparty system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="88"> No, we will not permit it just so that we can be called democrats because we are to responsive to our people's choice! I want to emphasize that democracy is our ultimate goal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="89"> But the main thing we must do on the path to it is change the people's attitude toward property.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="90"> We have already proclaimed the right to ownership of the land and we have adopted a whole package of laws, which shows the irreversibility of our movement toward the market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="91"> We think that only with the creation of a class of owners will there appear a basis for political reforms and democratization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="92"> We are moving toward and will definitely arrive at a normal democratic society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23933" num="93"> But only on our own path.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="13"> CSO [Text] The Khmer Rouge in Zone 505 clearly prosper from the timber trade with Thailand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="14"> They live in solid wooden houses, have electricity, watch television, and some of their children play with hand-held electronic games.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="15"> "The Khmers here are somewhat better off than elsewhere," said a Thai timber trader.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="16"> "Safety is 100 pre cent secure" in terms of traveling and communications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="17"> A week ago, it took three hours from Bo Rai district in the southeastern Thai province of Trat to reach this timber-rich community in Samlaut.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="18"> The best route there is maintained by the Khmer Rouge throughout the year because it is the only one that is usable during the wet season.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="19"> A four-wheel-drive truck is the only vehicle that can make the journey.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="20"> Thai timber traders stocked up with rice, dried and fresh food.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="21"> Most of it was for improving relations with guards along the way and ranking Khmers important to the smooth operation of their business.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="22"> Three Thai military checkpoints were passed before Khmer Rouge outposts were reached.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="23"> These border guards seemed to appreciate salted mackerel in particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="24"> War veterans, they had been taken off the battlefield and posted to these checkpoints to deal with Thai traders because they had been maimed by landmines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="25"> Zone 505 is in rich, variegated forest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="26"> Several Thai traders said they were more confident doing business with the Khmer Rouge than with people they refer to as Khmer Khao (White Khmers), meaning those loyal to the government in Phnom Penh.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="27"> "They [the Khmer Rouge] do not collect fees along the way like the Khmer Khao," one trader pointed out.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="28"> "Safety in terms of logging and access to sites is more or less reliable "If anything, it is fellow Thais who cause problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="29"> The Khmer Rouge officials keep to their word".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="30"> Zone 505 is home to 20,000 people, the majority of them women and children, many very young - the result of a Khmer Rouge population drive that has seen girls from age of 18 married off and encouraged to produce, residents said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="31"> But the leadership remains stringent about family life, no adultery or polygamy is allowed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="32"> According to Lok Nong, who is on the central committee of Zone 505, with special duties to co-ordinate with Thais and look after the timber trade, Khmer Rouge administration allows for some autonomy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="33"> If the zone's forces seize any territory belonging to government they are entitled to take charge and administer the benefits of that territory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="34"> "Zone 505 is reputed to be very experienced in fighting," he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="35"> The Khmer Rouge retake of Pailin, located north of here, last month was largely the work of soldiers from Zone 505.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="36"> Khmer Rouge units were closing in on Battambang and would eventually take the country's second largest provincial capital if the government obtained no foreign support, he claimed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="37"> "Thailand does not send arms to Democratic Kampuchea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="38"> We have to be self-sufficient in every respect now," Lok said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="39"> At community level, Khmer Rouge self-sufficiency is ensured by the central committee through a cooperative system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="40"> The committee administers the use of a central pool of tractors, rollers and other farming equipment, and the distribution of seeds to each household.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="41"> "Democratic Kampuchea's main sources of income are timber and gems," Lok said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="42"> "The income is used to improve the welfare of each zone.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="43"> We do not let any one individual or even the top administrator enrich himself alone".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="44"> Logging is carried out through cooperatives composed of no less than 10 parties.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="45"> The main rule is to fell trees that are sufficiently large.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="46"> While Zone 505's main income is timber, zone 405 located further north is engaged in gems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="47"> The men of this even more comfortable Khmer Rouge community are said to be reluctant to go to the battlefield.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="48"> The destination of Thai timber traders is a medium-size saw mill in the middle of a forest in Samlaut.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="49"> Khmer Rouge soldiers off duty from the frontlines guard the stacks of sawn timber on site.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="50"> Some 50 kilometers beyond, in a mountainous and forested area, a large pile of felled logs -- as many as 10,000 according to Khmer Rouge reckoning -- is waiting to be hauled across the border into Thailand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="51"> "Democratic Kampuchea will look after the timber until Thailand permits this," said a Khmer Rouge soldier.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="52"> Zone 505 enjoys relative peace and fairly good means of communication with surrounding areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="53"> But the area is heavily mined.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="54"> "We lean on Thais when we are in trouble," Lok said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28922" num="55"> "Now we are at peace, we want to encourage Thais to come and do business with us more than other nationals, who want only to drain us of our natural resources," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0182" num="9"> The Utah town of Big Water was still in business Wednesday, the day after some of its citizens failed to get rid of their polygamist libertarian mayor when a measure to get rid of the town was voted down.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0182" num="10"> The vote against disincorporation stood at 101 to 71, including a dozen challenged votes, "but with only 12 votes, it wouldn't have made any difference," said Dave Hansen, Utah's deputy lieutenant governor.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0182" num="11"> Hansen's office joined the attorney general's office in sending election monitors to Big Water after charges of illegal registration and vote fraud in a 1989 election deepened an abiding schism in this dusty retirement town of fewer than 400 people, where 54-year-old Alex Joseph has been mayor since the town incorporated in 1983.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0182" num="12"> The disincorporation election was not because of Joseph's libertarian politics or even his polygamy -- as embarrassing as that is for the town's image, said retired businessman Earl Tucker, a leader of the disincorporation campaign.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0182" num="13"> Rather, it was over concern that Joseph, his nine wives and various relatives and friends were getting a "stranglehold" on the town, holding most public offices and local businesses, and doling out a good chunk of the town's paying contract jobs to family or friends, Tucker said.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="6"> Entering the Kuala Lumpur headquarters of Al Arqam, an Islamic sect founded in Malaysia in the late 1960s and which claims more than 100,000 followers at home and abroad, is like walking into another century.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="7"> Men are dressed in flowing khaki robes and turbans, in imitation of a style said to have been favoured during the time of the prophet Mohammed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="8"> Women are draped in the black hijab, a familiar sight in many parts of the Middle East but rare in Malaysia, a country which prides itself on its religious and racial diversity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="9"> The sound of children chanting verses from the Koran comes from the Al Arqam school in the sprawling, five-acre compound.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="10"> According to the Malaysian authorities, this tranquil scene hides an altogether darker reality.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="11"> Yesterday, most of Al Arqam's activities were labelled as 'deviationist' by Malaysia's National Fatwa council, the body that rules on Islamic orthodoxy, and the government pledged to use a battery of laws to stop Al Arqam's proselytising activities.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="12"> More than 200 schools run by the sect throughout Malaysia will be closed down and Al Arqam members could be liable to imprisonment without trial under the terms of Malaysia's wide-ranging internal security act.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="13"> Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has described Al Arqam as 'a threat to national security'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="14"> Yesterday the group filed a defamation suit against the government for accusing it of raising a private army.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="15"> The government seems intent on doing battle with the sect.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="16"> 'They are the biggest threat faced by the government since the communists,' a senior government official said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="17"> Malaysia has lobbied other countries in the region to take action against the group.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="18"> Quite why Dr Mahathir's government has taken such a sudden dislike to Al Arqam is far from clear.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="19"> Over the years it has been tolerated and at times encouraged by the authorities.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="20"> Al Arqam (the name is derived from the house from which Mohammed is said to have spread his teachings) promotes a mystical path to Islam, in which a movement will rise in the East to hail the return of a messiah who will lead an Islamic revival.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="21"> Members live relatively unobtrusively, mostly in a series of communes spread throughout Malaysia.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="22"> The sect believes in strict adherence to Islamic principles in which, among other things, polygamy is encouraged.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="23"> Al Arqam's founder and leader, Ashaari Muhammad, exercises influence over every aspect of the sect's activities; all members wear badges bearing his portrait.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="24"> An Al Arqam media centre gives out lavishly produced books of Mr Ashaari's teachings.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="25"> Video cassettes promote his views while Al Arqam musical groups have produced record albums on similar themes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="26"> Mr Ashaari has lived in self-imposed exile in Thailand since 1988 but is now believed to have gone with a large number of his followers to Jordan.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="27"> The catalyst of official concern could have have been the arrest of 19 Malaysian Al Arqam members at a Moslem fundamentalist demonstration in Cairo in April.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="28"> About 55 per cent of Malaysia's 19m people are Moslem Malays.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="29"> For several years the government has been worried over Malays going abroad to study coming under the influence of militant Islamic groups, most of them on government scholarships.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="30"> Serious tensions could arise in multicultural Malaysia if such fiery brands of Islam took hold.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="31"> Some feel that Dr Mahathir sees Al Arqam as a potential political threat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="32"> Mr Ashaari ruffled official feathers recently when he is reported to have said that he was a more popular figure in Malaysia than Dr Mahathir.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="33"> General elections will probably be held in Malaysia later this year or early next.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="34"> Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (Umno) is unlikely to lose its tight grip on power but some Malays feel that, in the rush to modernise, the government has not paid enough attention to things spiritual.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="35"> There is concern within Umno that some members, once party stalwarts, have recently decided to join the ranks of Al Arqam.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="36"> The fundamentalist Parti Islam (PAS), based in the northern state of Kelantan, appeals to the poorer, rural voters.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="37"> Of more concern is a movement like Al Arqam whose followers come mainly from the urban-based intelligentsia, many of who hold senior positions in the civil service, the police and the armed forces.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="38"> Dr Mahathir will have to tread carefully in acting against the sect: any rigorous action could send shockwaves through the Malay community.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="39"> A relatively tranquil political atmosphere has been one of the key elements in attracting foreign investment to Malaysia, a central part of the country's economic success.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="40"> Al Arqam has considerable economic clout.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="41"> It has not allowed its brand of Islam to stand in the way of building a business empire which includes livestock, food processing, retail outlets, restaurants and clothing businesses both in Malaysia and the region.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="42"> Mr Hashim Jaafar, an Al Arqam spokesman, says the sect has commercial assets of Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.5m).</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="43"> The sect denies having political ambitions.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="44"> Mr Hashim claims Dr Mahathir fears the influence of his group which he says has established schools, hospitals and shops distributing services to 'the masses'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="45"> He adds that Dr Mahathir is also creating a climate of fear in advance of the elections.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10242" num="46"> 'He is trying to create a monster in order to win the support of non-Moslems', he says.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="6"> DIDEROT by PN Furbank Secker & Warburg Pounds 25, 523 pages WHAT IS the English for the 18th century French word philosophe?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="7"> Thinker? Ironist?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="8"> Satirist? Wise man?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="9"> Nothing quite works but it is at least clear the philosophes were not philosophers pure and simple, in the sense that they formulated a complete system of thought.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="10"> In this respect they are not like, say, Descartes, Locke or Hume; yet to understand their work in any kind of depth you have to engage with a great deal of hard-core philosophical argument.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="11"> Their most cogent British interpreters have tended to be professional philosophers or political scientists, Ayer on Voltaire (1986) and Cranston on Rousseau - in a major biography of which the final volume is still awaited.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="12"> PN Furbank is the exception in that he is a literary critic and biographer with previous books on EM Forster, Samuel Butler and Italo Svevo to his credit.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="13"> Yet happily Furbank is more than capable of presenting with clarity the main philosophical issues that abound in the work of Diderot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="14"> The sub-title - 'a critical biography' - is here an exact description of the book.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="15"> Furbank deals comprehensively with the life and the work of this liberating writer in roughly equal parts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="16"> Diderot, son of a cutler, was a wonderfully entertaining, radically subversive genius.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="17"> He was, above all, brave; never afraid to risk his neck in publicly proclaiming his violently anti-clerical views with immense vigour in spite of having suffered a period of harsh imprisonment in his youth on account of them.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="18"> If Diderot is best known to us as the architect of the Encyclopedie, as an early champion of the notion of the Tree of Knowledge, and more generally as a protagonist of the Enlightenment (a term about which this book has some sharply corrective things to say), we are reminded by Furbank that Diderot's total output also included many polemical essays and treatises, regular art criticism, pieces of theatre, and some brilliant fictional dialogues.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="19"> A sense of virtuosic performance typifies Diderot's life as much as it did his work.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="20"> He was greatly in demand socially, and would entrance his contemporaries by his flow of sparkling discourse even when he was embattled in furious argument with them.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="21"> He had long love-hate relations with both Rousseau and Voltaire, less stormy ones with his other collaborators on the Encyclopedia, D'Alembert, Holbach, Naigeon, and with Baron Grimm (not to be confused with the folklorists of the same name).</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="22"> One of Diderot's greatest fans was Catherine the Great, who supported him financially for much of his career and persuaded him at an advanced age to go to St Petersburg as her adviser on how to run her empire; though she does not seem to have acted on his voluminous advice.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="23"> Furbank paints vivid portraits of Diderot's shrewish wife, Nanette, and of his intellectual mistress, Sophie Volland.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="24"> Diderot was torn apart like any typical honnete homme or pere de famille in a boulevard farce.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="25"> Unlike Rousseau he accepted the burden of parenthood but did not allow it to impair his career.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="26"> Nothing in his life ever could or did.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="27"> He was unceasingly industrious.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="28"> His surviving child married a businessman who prospered and she provided Diderot with two grandchildren upon whom he doted.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="29"> Angelique, his daughter, also wrote the earliest life of Diderot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="30"> Furbank places Diderot's novels within the tradition of European fiction in the 18th century and highlights their relevance and readability today.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="31"> This is his most useful service for the lay reader.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="32"> He draws an interesting distinction between novelists like Jane Austen, Balzac and Dickens, and many other mainstream writers of fiction, who rely on giving their readers an illusion of reality, and those like Diderot who practise a kind of deception or con trick on them.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="33"> In Diderot the reader is deceived into believing that the events described actually occurred.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="34"> Diderot much admired the work of Richardson, where this kind of deceptive technique is apparent in the way the events of the novel are viewed at one remove through a sequence of authentic-seeming letters, all of them carefully dated.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="35"> Diderot's deceptions took many devious forms.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="36"> His novel about the horrors of conventual life, The Nun, derived from a case of an unwanted illegitimate female child who was forced to take nun's vows at the age of 16, and then when she had grown to self-awareness found it impossible to renounce them.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="37"> In other instances, too, Diderot grafted the fiction onto an episode in the life of a known individual.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="38"> The composer Rameau, for example, happened to have a nephew who was a mediocre composer and a layabout.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="39"> In his fable Rameau's Nephew Diderot takes him as an example of the social parasite and engages with him in a dialogue that examines the role of genius in society.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="40"> In D'Alembert's Dream Diderot used another real person, his chief assistant on the Encyclopedia, the mathematician D'Alembert, to initiate a dramatically conveyed discussion of materialism.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="41"> The obscurity nowadays of the real people deployed by Diderot in such works has prevented them reaching many British readers outside the universities.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="42"> If we are ignorant of the French naval officer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, who in 1771 wrote an account of a Voyage around the world (except perhaps through the purple plant named after him), why should we read Diderot's Supplement to that Voyage?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="43"> Yet the Supplement is a masterpiece of irony, hilariously arguing the case for polygamy and the economic virtues inherent in a state of nature.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="44"> These strategies of deception also include direct addresses to the reader whom Diderot invites to join in the argument.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="45"> His most elaborate performance of this kind was the posthumous Jacques the Fatalist, to which Furbank devotes a concluding chapter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="46"> It is a book that defies summary, a running dialogue inverting the relations between master and servant; in part a parody of Cervantes, also an essay on determinism, and a landmark in the history of the anti-novel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="47"> It appeared in a readable English translation in the Penguin classics in 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11381" num="48"> After Furbank it should acquire many more British admirers.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="10"> THE JUNGLE IS SO THICK THAT ARTHUR Demarest and the archeological inspector assigned to him don't see the army platoon until the comandante is in their path, demanding identification.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="11"> Demarest has plenty: documents from Guatemala's History and Anthropology Institute, a gold-sealed letter from National Geographic and even a notarized Spanish translation of his Harvard diploma.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="12"> The comandante, whose squadron of full-blooded Mayan Indians appears ominously battle-scarred, offers to lead them to the cave they're seeking -- not exactly the safest proposition in this guerrilla-infested rain forest, but unavoidable under the circumstances.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="13"> For three hours they follow their machete-wielding guides through the amber-green filtered light of the mahogany canopy, their eyes probing the leafy ground cover for venomous serpents while scarlet macaws screech overhead.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="14"> Finally they arrive at a large hole in the moist soil, leading into a limestone cave.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="15"> As they descend, their lamps reveal a stretch of stalactites, an altar black with burned incense, human bones painted red, ceramic pottery, lithic spear points and a cascading stream.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="16"> There is a noise, and something shoots past them; a large tropical rodent called a tepezquintle, a local delicacy.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="17"> Immediately, soldiers aim their automatic M-16s, and everyone screams.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="18"> The inspector drops his camera, breaking it, and Demarest pleads with the comandante to stop the firing; pots will be trampled, ricocheting bullets will kill them all, the cave will collapse -- and with it his hopes of answering the question he is spending more than $1 million to answer.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="19"> Eventually, the rodent disappears, the soldiers hold their fire, and the archeologist, the inspector and the artifacts escape unscathed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="20"> IT IS ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT MYSTERIES.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="21"> No one knows for certain where they came from.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="22"> As for when they arrived in Central America, less is presumed now than 20 years ago, because the dating of early relics at 2500 BC hinged on faulty carbon-14 data.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="23"> Assumptions abruptly dissolved, leaving the truth buried beneath more than two millennia's worth of jungle and alluvium.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="24"> It is generally agreed, however, that by 900 BC a sophisticated culture called Maya had spread across the great lowland limestone shelf that today comprises Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, Belize and the northern half of Guatemala.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="25"> It was an elaborate society that must have seemed to its people destined to thrive forever.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="26"> Sixteen-hundred years later, at least 6 million Maya lived in what in some ways resembled Southern California: a flourishing megalopolis of city-states, with few breaks among their overlapping suburbs.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="27"> Their monumental architecture, as well as their painting, astronomy, mathematics and literature, humbled the achievements of their contemporaries in Europe.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="28"> Equally striking and far less understood is how so many could inhabit a tropical rain forest.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="29"> For centuries, they raised their food and families in the same fragile environment that today is quickly devastated by a relatively few hungry squatters.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="30"> What has baffled archeologists even more, however, is the Maya's spectacular, sudden collapse.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="31"> Within just 100 years at the beginning of the 8th Century, lowland Mayan civilization simply vanished.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="32"> In most of the Yucatan, only scattered remnants of the population remained; the Peten province that encompasses northern Guatemala was left virtually uninhabited.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="33"> Rain-forest vegetation soon overran the ball courts and plazas, enshrouding tall pyramids.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="34"> Except for an occasional vagrant Spanish conquistador, not until the 19th Century would the world again be aware of the Maya's existence.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="35"> Speculation over what happened to the Maya has included possibilities such as famine, epidemics, overpopulation and soil erosion -- yet for each explanation, arguments exist against its causing extinction on such a massive scale.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="36"> Although most Mayan cities were notably indefensible, no relics indicate a significant invasion of alien forces.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="37"> Often extolled as history's exemplary peaceful society, the Maya seemed least likely to consume themselves in internal warfare.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="38"> Yet Demarest's recent discoveries in the steamy Peten suggest that is exactly what happened.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="39"> Under the co-sponsorship of Vanderbilt University and the Instituto de Antropologia y Historia de Guatemala, one of the most ambitious archeological ventures ever assembled has begun a quest for the answer to the Mayan collapse.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="40"> Demarest, its brash 37-year-old director, is a Louisiana Cajun who won an international reputation while still a graduate student.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="41"> Five years ago, he declined a Harvard chair considered to be the most distinguished position in archeology because Vanderbilt offered him a chance to set up his own Mesoamerican department and select a dream project.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="42"> After barely a year, accounts from Guatemala's Peten jungles of his team's findings have evoked comparisons to Indiana Jones -- analogies that even he occasionally lets slip when confronting yet another pristine cavern laden with ancient Mayan ceramics.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="43"> Yet there the resemblance ends.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="44"> Instead of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the movie that most often comes to Demarest's mind is "The Year of Living Dangerously".</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="45"> In Guatemala, guerrillas and the army stalk each other within a few kilometers of his excavations, catching in their cross-fire people who still speak languages derived from those used for the hieroglyphics his team is decoding.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="46"> "Indiana Jones," he says wearily, "swashbuckled through a mythical, generic, non-English-speaking Third World of swarthy people with threatening, incomprehensible ways, defeating them with American heroics and seizing their treasures.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="47"> But archeology isn't about glittery objects -- it's about their context.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="48"> We're part of the context.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="51"> It is late; the generator in his field camp is off, and he works at his desk through the humid night by Coleman lantern, his fingers worrying his thick black hair.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="55"> Demarest has come to the Peten to prove his theory that, over 2,000 years, the Maya evolved a means of resolving conflicts among nations without destroying each others' societies -- but then something went wrong.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="56"> With an international team that includes earth scientists and an assortment of archeological specialists, he intends to spend the next five years finding out exactly what.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="57"> Besides receiving grants from the National Geographic Society, the National Endowment for the Humanities and Alimentos Kerns, a Guatemalan corporation, his project has also attracted funding from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Peace Foundation and the United States Institute for Peace.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="58"> In an endless stream of grant proposals, Demarest has pointed out that grasping what happened to the Maya may reveal why all civilizations seem to rise only to bring themselves down -- and perhaps offer clues about how, for once, that might be avoided.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="59"> FORTY MINUTES NORTHEAST OF THE ISLAND city of Flores on Guatemala's Lake Peten Itxa, a paved road arrives at the fabulous ruins of Tikal, the largest classic Mayan site, its white temples soaring 230 feet above the jungle floor.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="60"> In the opposite direction, another road from Flores, decidedly unpaved, leads southwest for three miserable hours.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="61"> Passing through various army checkpoints and an occasional guerrilla roadblock, it ends at the scruffy outpost of Sayaxche, where a machine-gun emplacement perches atop a Mayan pyramid and where no one is up to any particular good.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="62"> Sayaxche is on the Rio Pasion -- the Passion River -- which slithers through the western Peten to the confluence of the rivers Usamacinta and Salinas, together forming Guatemala's border with Mexico.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="63"> Once the Pasion was a chief route for trade in jade, fine pottery, quetzal feathers and jaguar skins.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="64"> Today's traffic includes contraband mahogany and cedar logs, opium from Guatemalan highland poppies and looted Mayan artifacts.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="65"> Down one of its sluggish tributaries, motor-driven wooden launches also have recently carried quantities of two modest items that in the Peten are veritable luxuries: corrugated tin roofing and cases of Spam.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="66"> The roofing was for the base camp that Demarest built in a jungle clearing for the 23 archeologists and more than 100 workmen he had hired by the end of the digging season, which lasts from January to June.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="67"> The Spam was the most recognizable component of their daily sustenance.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="68"> In just five years, the Mesoamerican program Demarest founded at Vanderbilt has attracted brilliant archeologists and graduate students capable of translating 1,500-year-old hieroglyphics, but none ever conclusively identified the alien green broth that regularly passed for breakfast.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="69"> Spam, tin, tools, lab equipment, field library, portable generator, mystery meals and some non-inventoried bottles of Scotch had been transported from the river on bony mules and horses, their bodies sucked nearly hollow by vampire bats.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="75"> Along the escarpment's ragged edge, the Maya built cities that Demarest's team has determined once formed an interlocking kingdom called the Petexbatun.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="81"> This site, Arroyo de Piedra, is being excavated by a slim, mild 25-year-old graduate student named David Stuart.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="82"> The son of National Geographic archeologist George Stuart, he spent hours as a child first staring at, then drawing Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="91"> Their ability to read inscriptions on the stelae -- stone monoliths that stand in Mayan ceremonial plazas -- is responsible for Demarest's conclusion that, about AD 700, one of the Petexbatun city-states began to break the rules of restrained conflict.</s>

<s docid="LA101490-0183" num="102"> With his National Geographic benefactors expecting a prime-time TV documentary, Demarest realizes that this is the point in his career when he must defer his fascination for ancient trash pits and open a royal tomb.</s>
