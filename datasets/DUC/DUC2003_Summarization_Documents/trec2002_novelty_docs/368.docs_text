<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="10"> Kathy Wyckoff figured she knew all there was to know about surrogate parenting.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="11"> Shewas a surrogate mother herself nine years ago, an experience that led her to found a surrogate brokerage business in San Clemente.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="12"> Since then, she has matched infertile couples with surrogates, completing more than 50 successful births.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="13"> But then, Wyckoff and her husband, Tom Olivor, wanted their own child.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="14"> By now unable to conceive, they decided to hire an experienced surrogate they knew from her company.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="15"> Suddenly, Wyckoff found herself on the other side, as anxious as all her would-be parents at not being able to control the pregnancy of their unborn child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="16"> "I had no idea," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="17"> "Being the couple is so much more difficult than being the surrogate".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="18"> Olivor, too, said he was on an emotional roller coaster until their surrogate, an unmarried Long Beach woman, delivered a healthy baby and they brought him home in August.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="19"> "We took turns going crazy," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="20"> Since 1975, an estimated 4,000 babies have been born in surrogate arrangements in the United States, about half of them through a handful of programs such as Wyckoff's -- the Center for Reproductive Alternatives -- that use the services of professionals like lawyers, doctors and psychologists.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="21"> Most come off without a hitch: Fewer than 1% of surrogates change their mind and want to keep the child.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="22"> There are no known cases of a handicapped child born in a surrogate arrangement.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="23"> Though rare, each contested case represents a contracting couple's worst nightmare come true.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="24"> In the well-publicized Baby M case, New Jersey surrogate Mary Beth Whitehead changed her mind and was eventually awarded visitation rights.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="25"> Three years ago, a Chula Vista couple agreed to share custody with their Mexican surrogate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="26"> And most recently, Anna Johnson, an Orange County surrogate, sued the couple who hired her because they allegedly did not give her sufficient support during her pregnancy.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="27"> However, it is the first contested case in which the surrogate, impregnated through in vitro fertilization, has no genetic link to the unborn child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="28"> Such cases also spur consideration of public policy for what is becoming an increasingly popular alternative means of procreation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="29"> Many states have considered surrogacy legislation, and 16 have passed statutes, some providing misdemeanor penalties for engaging in a contract.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="30"> According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those states that have banned surrogacy or declared contracts unenforceable are: Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah and Washington.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="31"> Meanwhile, brokers report an increase in what is known as gestational surrogacy, as in the Johnson case.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="32"> And they report many calls from "do-it-yourselfers" -- couples, like the pair who hired Anna Johnson, who have found their own surrogate and are seeking further directions on how to proceed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="33"> To Wyckoff, who runs a relatively small operation -- 10 cases a year -- out of her home, such cases also serve to illuminate the pitfalls of unregulated surrogacy arrangements made by individuals without the benefit of programs such as hers that screen participants for compatibility and supply long-term psychological support.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="34"> Wyckoff first became involved in surrogacy 10 years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="35"> Married to another man, she was the mother of three children and living in the Midwest.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="36"> She knew a couple who were desperately trying to have children but could not.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="37"> Sympathetic, she tried to help them by researching alternatives.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="38"> Catholics, like herself, they rejected surrogacy as immoral.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="39"> But Wyckoff said: "The more I found out, the more I knew this was the right thing to do".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="40"> Rather than giving "the gift of life," she said she wanted to give the "gift of parenthood".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="41"> Wyckoff contacted a doctor in the Midwest who ran the only program she knew of at the time and was artificially inseminated.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="42"> The program required anonymity, provided no counseling and did not allow couples or surrogates to select each other, she said; they had no say in the matchups.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="43"> Even her labor was induced, and Wyckoff has no idea what happened to the child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="44"> Later, when an infertile couple she had met in the program asked her to help them meet a surrogate and make the arrangements, she agreed, and subsequent referrals marked the beginning of her business.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="45"> She relocated to Newport Beach, after a divorce in 1984 and marriage to Olivor, an architect.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="46"> After five years, they decided they wanted children of their own.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="47"> But complications from endometriosis, and later an ectopic pregnancy, forced Wyckoff to undergo a hysterectomy after which she could not conceive.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="48"> By this time, her business was so well established she had repeat customers and repeat surrogates.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="49"> Many of them, like Susie, had become personal friends who formed the core social life for Wyckoff, 36, and Olivor, 47.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="50"> They had particularly admired Susie, a 28-year-old civilian merchandiser for the Navy, for her strength and independence.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="51"> She had given birth to healthy children twice before, once to a son who was adopted independently and once to a daughter for a couple in the program.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="52"> They asked her if she would be artificially inseminated again, this time for them.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="53"> She agreed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="54"> "It doesn't seem unusual to us," Olivor said.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="55"> "In 1980, it was a radical thing to do.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="56"> In 1990, it's not that radical a procedure".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="57"> Following the procedure Wyckoff prescribes for her clients, they each obtained lawyers, signed contracts stipulating Wyckoff would adopt the child later, and attended psychological counseling sessions before the insemination.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="58"> Over the duration of the pregnancy and two months after delivery, they will pay her about $13,000.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="59"> In general, the total cost to couples in Wyckoff's program ranges from $27,000 to $29,000, with the additional money going to lawyers, psychologists and doctors fees and travel expenses.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="60"> Wyckoff would not disclose how much she profits from each case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="61"> During her pregnancy, Susie kept on working, and used the extra money for trips and a new car, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="62"> Wyckoff and Olivor said they tried to hide their anxiety from her, in the belief that she would produce a calm child if she remained calm herself.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="63"> However, Olivor said switching from observer to participant was "emotionally wrenching".</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="64"> At one point, Olivor, a fallen-away Catholic like his wife, said he was certain a handicapped child would be God's punishment for having been involved in surrogacy: "That's how crazy it got".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="65"> Wyckoff was equally unnerved over the lack of control and often wondered if she shouldn't have gone through another program other than her own.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="66"> For instance, there was the question of whether the other surrogates would be jealous that the "Mother Superior" had played favorites by choosing one of them, a fear that didn't materialize, Wyckoff said.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="67"> Moreover, there was the nagging feeling that she had just been consistently "lucky" in arranging 57 successful births.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="68"> What if this would be the one time something went wrong?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="69"> Wyckoff coached Susie during the brief delivery and cut the umbilical cord.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="70"> She and Tom stayed at the hospital overnight and drove her home the next day.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="71"> They stayed half an hour and left with the child.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="72"> Later they sent a bouquet of balloons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="73"> For Susie, who does not want to raise children of her own, it was basically a job, albeit a special one.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="74"> "I kept that kind of an attitude," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="75"> "I never got attached to the baby.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="76"> Never thought, what if he was mine?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="77"> "Some of us are made to be moms, and some of us are made to do this".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="78"> She said she will probably be a surrogate for another couple in the program in February.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="79"> "They've had some major hard luck.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="80">. . . I've been lucky enough to get pregnant the first time, have healthy 8-pound babies, lots of hair.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="81"> Good babies" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="82"> Indirectly, she's also doing it for Wyckoff, whom she considers almost like a sister.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="83"> "I see how Kathy feels the more time she spends with a couple and there's no baby.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="84"> I know I could step in and say, 'OK, I don't mind being pregnant,' and everybody would be happy.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="85"> Then that look would leave her eye.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="86"> All gets right with the world".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="87"> But she thinks she will quit the program when she's 30.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="88"> "I don't want to be having kids the rest of my life".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="89"> Rocking the sleeping baby named Michael, Wyckoff said her sympathies unquestioningly lie with Mark and Crispina Calvert, the biological parents of the child being carried by Anna Johnson.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="90"> "I understood Mary Beth Whitehead and her desire to keep the baby.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="91"> But it's hard for me to understand where Anna Johnson is coming from".</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="92"> (The baby boy, born last week, is now with the Calverts.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="93"> Johnson is still seeking shared custody).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="94"> In her program, surrogate candidates are screened for genetic history, mental illness and chemical dependency -- and personality characteristics compatible with Wyckoff's.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="95"> Once accepted, they attend group sessions with counselors to help one another deal with thoughts of keeping the child and accept that the baby will belong to the contracting couple.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="96"> "I'd never have a surrogate in a program without ongoing psychological counseling and the camaraderie of other surrogates.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="97"> It's essential".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="98"> Even though her own surrogate said she did not need counseling after the birth, Wyckoff said she insisted, as always, "so they can resolve even the slightest thing said or done, so it won't come back to haunt them".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="99"> She and her husband see a big problem with the "do-it-yourselfers".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="100"> "Do-it-yourself surrogacy is like wanting to go to Hawaii.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="101"> You buy a yacht, and ask the broker, 'Which way to Hawaii'?</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="102"> He points and says, 'That way,' " Olivor said.</s>

<s docid="LA092590-0067" num="103"> "It's that kind of adventure".</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="6"> The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority yesterday said its members had overcome the initial 'yuk factor' they felt over using eggs from aborted foetuses to treat infertility and were now keeping an open mind.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="7"> The HFEA - the government body set up in 1991 to regulate 'test-tube baby' clinics - rushed out a consultation document in response to widespread concern about research which could lead to foetal eggs being used to treat infertile women within three years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="8"> Sir Colin Campbell, HFEA chairman, said yesterday that members of the authority had reacted with 'unease, distaste and surprise' when they first heard about the technique.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="9"> But this emotional response to the 'Yuk factor' had passed, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="10"> The document itself acknowledges that the public 'may feel an initial repugnance' to using aborted foetuses to help women whose own eggs are defective in some way.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="11"> But it says the authority has an open mind and is looking forward to hearing people's views on the issue.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="12"> Scientists at Edinburgh University, led by Dr Roger Gosden, have shown that the technique works with animals.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="13"> It involves removing ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in the laboratory, fertilising them with sperm and then implanting the resulting embryos into the womb.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="14"> Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said it would not be permissible to use human foetal ovaries under present legislation, and Dr Gosden has stopped the research programme until the HFEA has issued new guidelines.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="15"> These are not expected before the autumn.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16729" num="16"> There is currently a severe shortage of donated eggs available for implantation into infertile women, who typically wait between three and five years for treatment in one of Britain's 63 fertility clinics.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="15"> By now unable to conceive, they decided to hire an experienced surrogate they knew from her company.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="16"> Suddenly, Wyckoff found herself on the other side, as anxious as all her would-be parents at not being able to control the pregnancy of their unborn child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="17"> "I had no idea," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="18"> "Being the couple is so much more difficult than being the surrogate".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="19"> Olivor, too, said he was on an emotional roller coaster until their surrogate, an unmarried Long Beach woman, delivered a healthy baby and they brought him home last week.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="20"> "We took turns going crazy," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="21"> Since 1975, an estimated 4,000 babies have been born in surrogate arrangements in the United States, about half of them through a handful of professionally supervised programs, like Wyckoff's, the Center for Reproductive Alternatives.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="22"> Most come off without a hitch: Less than 1% of surrogates change their mind and want to keep the child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="23"> Though rare, each contested case represents a contracting couple's worst nightmare come true.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="24"> In the well-publicized Baby M case, New Jersey surrogate Mary Beth Whitehead changed her mind and was eventually awarded visitation rights; three years ago, a Chula Vista couple agreed to share custody with their Mexican surrogate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="25"> And most recently, Anna Johnson, an Orange County surrogate, sued the couple who hired her because they allegedly did not give her sufficient support during her pregnancy.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="26"> However, it is the first contested case in which the surrogate, impregnated through in vitro fertilization, has no genetic link to the unborn child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="27"> Such cases also spur consideration of public policy for what is becoming an increasingly popular alternative means of procreation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="28"> Many states have considered legislation on surrogation, and 16 have passed statutes, some providing misdemeanor penalties for engaging in a contract.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="29"> According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those which have banned surrogation or declared contracts unenforceable are: Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah and Washington.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="30"> Meanwhile, brokers report an increase in what is known as gestational surrogation, as in the Johnson case.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="31"> And they report many calls from "do-it-yourselfers" -- couples, like the pair who hired Anna Johnson, who have found their own surrogate and are seeking further directions on how to proceed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="32"> To Wyckoff, who runs a relatively small operation -- 10 cases a year -- out of her home, such cases also serve to illuminate the pitfalls of unregulated surrogate arrangements made by individuals without the benefit of programs like hers, which screen participants for compatibility and supply long-term psychological support.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="33"> Wyckoff first became involved in surrogation 10 years ago as a married mother of three in the Midwest.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="34"> She knew a couple who were desperately trying to have children but could not.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="35"> Sympathetic, she tried to help them by researching alternatives.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="36"> Catholics, like herself, they rejected surrogation as immoral.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="37"> But Wyckoff said: "The more I found out, the more I knew this was the right thing to do".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="38"> Rather than giving "the gift of life," she said she wanted to give the "gift of parenthood".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="39"> She contacted a doctor in the Midwest who ran the only known program at the time.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="40"> It required anonymity, provided no counseling and offered no choice to couples or surrogates, she said.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="41"> Even her labor was induced.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="42"> Later, when an infertile couple she had met in the clinic asked her to help them meet a surrogate and make the arrangements, she agreed, and subsequent referrals marked the beginning of her business.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="43"> She relocated to California, after a divorce in 1984 and remarriage to Olivor, an architect.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="44"> After five years, they decided they wanted children of their own.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="45"> But complications from endometriosis, and later an ectopic pregnancy, forced Wyckoff to undergo a hysterectomy after which she could not conceive.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="46"> By this time, her business was so well established she had repeat customers and repeat surrogates.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="47"> Many of them, like Susie, had become personal friends who formed the core social life for Wyckoff, 36, and Olivor, 47.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="48"> They had particularly admired Susie, a 28-year-old Navy merchandiser, for her strength and independence.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="49"> She had given birth to healthy children twice before, once to a son who was adopted, and once to a daughter for a couple in the program.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="50"> They asked her if she would be artificially inseminated.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="51"> She agreed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="52"> "It doesn't seem unusual to us," Olivor said.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="53"> "In 1980, it was a radical thing to do.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="54"> In 1990, it's not that radical a procedure".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="55"> Following the procedure she prescribes for her clients, they each obtained lawyers, signed contracts stipulating that Wyckoff would adopt the child later, and attended psychological counseling sessions before the insemination.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="56"> Over the duration of the pregnancy and two months after delivery, they will pay her about $13,000, following state guidelines for adoptions.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="57"> The total cost to couples in the program ranges from $27,000 to $29,000.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="58"> During her pregnancy, Susie kept on working and used the extra money for trips and a new car, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="59"> Wyckoff and Olivor said they tried to hide their anxiety from her in the belief that she would produce a calm child if she remained calm herself.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="60"> However, Olivor said switching from observer to participant was "emotionally wrenching".</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="61"> At one point, Olivor, also a fallen-away Catholic, said he was certain a handicapped child would be God's punishment for having been involved in surrogation.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="62"> "That's how crazy it got".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="63"> Wyckoff was equally unnerved over the lack of control and often wondered if she shouldn't have gone through another program other than her own.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="64"> For instance, there was the question of whether the other surrogates would be jealous that the "Mother Superior" had played favorites by choosing one of them, a fear that didn't materialize, Wyckoff said.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="65"> Moreover, there was the nagging feeling that she had just been consistently "lucky" in arranging 57 successful births.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="66"> What if this would be the one time something went wrong?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="67"> Wyckoff coached Susie during the brief delivery and cut the umbilical cord.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="68"> She and Tom stayed at the hospital overnight and drove her home the next day.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="69"> They stayed a half hour and left with the child.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="70"> Later they sent a bouquet of balloons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="71"> For Susie, who does not want to raise children of her own, it was basically a job, albeit a special one.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="72"> "I kept that kind of an attitude," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="73"> "I never got attached to the baby.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="74"> Never thought, what if he was mine".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="75"> "Some of us are made to be moms, and some of us are made to do this".</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="82"> I know I could step in and say, 'OK, I don't mind being pregnant,' and everybody would be happy.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="83"> Then that look would leave her eye.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="84"> All gets right with the world".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="85"> But she thinks she will quit the program when she's 30.</s>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="86"> "I don't want to be having kids the rest of my life".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="87"> Rocking the sleeping baby named Michael, Wyckoff said her sympathies unquestioningly lie with the Calverts, the biological parents of the child being carried by Anna Johnson.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="90"> In her program, surrogate candidates are screened for genetic history, mental illness and chemical dependency -- and personality characteristics compatible with Wyckoff's.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082190-0143" num="94"> Even though her own surrogate said she did not need counseling after the birth, Wyckoff said she insisted, as always, "so they can resolve even the slightest thing said or done, so it won't come back to haunt them".</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="4"> FT 14 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Using the foetus to treat infertility</s>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="5"> 'Yuk factor' has become the first catchphrase of 1994 in British newspapers.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="6"> It does not refer to politicians' private lives, but to the latest developments in birth technology.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="7"> People are supposedly saying 'yuk' to grannies giving birth in their 60s, black women choosing white babies and, above all, to the potential use of eggs taken from aborted foetuses for treating infertility.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="8"> This may indeed be a natural first reaction to the prospect of removing the ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in a test tube, fertilising them with sperm and implanting them in the uterus of a woman whose own eggs are defective.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="9"> The public is still squeamish about any medical use of foetal tissue - for example to treat Parkinson's disease - and it is easy to put people off the idea of creating a baby whose genetic mother was aborted.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="10"> However, initial distaste should not be allowed permanently to block development of a technique that could help many thousands of infertile couples, who typically have to wait three to five years to receive eggs from adult donors.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="11"> (Giving eggs is an arduous process involving powerful drugs and an operation).</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="12"> Opponents of new birth technologies argue that women have no God-given right to bear children.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="13"> But infertility is certainly a painful affliction, even if it is not a disease in the conventional sense.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="14"> Although fundamental moral objections can be raised both to abortion itself and by deduction to any manipulation of a rejected foetus, these cannot be decisive in a country such as the UK, where abortion is legal under some circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="15"> At the crudest level of argument, it is surely better to make medical use of foetal material if possible, than just to throw it into the hospital incinerator.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="16"> Moral issues In the UK, the body responsible for regulating birth technologies is the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is admired worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="17"> Its members, derived from professional and lay backgrounds, are responsible for assessing the many subtle moral and practical issues which arise.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="18"> One widespread concern is that a child could suffer psychologically from the knowledge that its genetic mother was, in effect, an aborted foetus.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="19"> However, it is not difficult to imagine that the circumstances facing such a child might be easier to accept than those of an adopted child who was 'rejected', for whatever reason, by both biological parents.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="20"> Another minefield will be obtaining informed consent - an essential part of current donor programmes.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="21"> Who should give consent on behalf of an aborted foetus?</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="22"> Just the woman having the abortion?</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="23"> Or should the father of the foetus have a say (if his identity is known) on the grounds that his genes should not be passed on to future generations without his knowledge?</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="24"> Medical decisions The HFEA will also wish to ensure that women are not encouraged in any way to have an abortion - or, perhaps more likely, to respond to pressures to delay the operation so as to give the foetal ovaries more time to develop in the womb.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="25"> Medical decisions about the abortion itself must be kept strictly separate from the procedure for seeking consent to use foetal material in research or treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="26"> The HFEA's record suggests that, if it decides in principle that foetal ovaries can be used to treat infertility, it will be able to devise a practical framework in which clinics can operate.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="27"> The real obstacles would then be scientific.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="28"> Although the technique has worked in laboratory animals, researchers still need to show that there is no excess risk of congenital abnormality from using eggs from a foetus instead of an adult donor.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="29"> That means understanding better the factors that control the decline in egg numbers from more than 1m in the foetus to less than 100,000 in a fertile woman; if the body naturally discards inferior eggs during childhood, it could be dangerous to use foetal ovaries.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="30"> Subject to these legal and scientific safeguards, researchers should be allowed to develop foetal egg donation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15524" num="31"> If they succeed, the technique will eventually join the armoury of accepted treatments that aroused distaste when they were first mooted, including organ transplants and test-tube babies.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="15"> "But at last we have established that couples -- not their physicians or anyone else -- have the right to determine their own reproductive futures".</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="16"> In 1985, the Yorks, then residents of New Jersey, had gone to the Norfolk clinic, one of the oldest and most famous reproductive centers on the East Coast, to get help in conceiving a child through an in vitro fertilization program.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="19"> The Yorks, however, tired of their semiannual cross-country trips and decided to have the final embryo implanted by a physician in Los Angeles at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, which the couple believe has a better success rate at impregnating women with frozen in vitro fertilized eggs than does the Virginia clinic.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="20"> For months, the Virginia clinic, however, denied the Yorks' request to transfer the frozen embryo.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="26"> The couple had initially filed suit not only to get custody of their embryo but also to claim $200,000 in damages for emotional stress against the clinic.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="27"> Last week, the parties reached a voluntary settlement, in which the clinic was released from any liability and the couple dropped the $200,000 claim.</s>

<s docid="LA092689-0055" num="28"> According to the Yorks, they have now earned 60,000 frequent-flyer miles in their cross-country trips and spent more than $35,000 in medical fees alone.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="6"> Provided no one gets hurt, does it matter where babies come from?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="7"> If it does matter, do we know where to draw the line?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="8"> Society, we assume, decides what scientists shall do - hence the latest alarms about egg-farming and designer babies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="9"> But scientific breakthroughs will themselves re-define social attitudes.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="10"> For the next four months the British public is being invited to join an ethical debate about overcoming the severe shortage of human eggs for embryo research and the treatment of infertile women.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="11"> The Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, a committee of experts and prominent citizens, wants to know what the public thinks about taking eggs or ovarian tissue from corpses and even (when the procedure becomes reliable) from aborted foetuses.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="12"> First reactions have been predictable.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="13"> For a second opinion, I went to see Robert Edwards, the Cambridge professor who brought test-tube babies into the world, at the splendid Jacobean house outside Cambridge where he and Patrick Steptoe founded their clinic.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="14"> It has taken the public 20 years to accept in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and Prof Edwards, a distinguished scientist, knows all there is to know about controversy.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="15"> He has even had to sue for libel.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="16"> He gives the impression of one who is immune to criticism but not to contradiction.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="17"> Yet from behind the set face and flat northern accent there gradually emerged a humane and pleasant subtlety.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="18"> Not surprisingly, Edwards is a militant libertarian.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="19"> He seeks the maximum possible freedom for scientific inquiry and the minimum of statutory intervention into what he regards as a humane endeavour to satisfy a fundamental human desire, which is to produce children.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="20"> I asked him how the latest outbreak compared with the test-tube baby furore.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="21"> 'There have been endless controversies, all of them headline news.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="22"> This is only the latest.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="23"> But could I say that we started the ethical debate in the whole field in 1971'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="24"> He was referring to an article he wrote with David Sharpe, an American academic lawyer, for Nature magazine.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="25"> There he called for elaboration of the issues 'in order to give time for defining and evolving social attitudes on which to base rules of conduct for scientists and society'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="26"> Some scientists, I said, argue theirs is a pure, untrammelled, discipline and it's not for them to take the ethical decisions.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="27"> 'I've never, ever believed that.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="28"> I've always said that in the early stages of investigation the crucial roles are played by the scientists and doctors'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="29"> Would you yourself use foetal ovaries?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="30"> 'I would grow them at the present time to the stage before fertilisation,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="31"> 'I would want to know they're perfectly normal before I take any further step.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="32"> That will probably take years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="33"> Then I would probably fertilise some and grow them as embryos.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="34"> 'I would not transfer them (into the surrogate mother) because there could be considerable social backlash to this work.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="35"> 'In any ethical debate one must always put down a period of two to three years for social balance to be established.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="36"> The effect of many scientific developments on society comes as a shock. . . the 'yuk factor' or whatever you call it'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="37"> Would you treat single women?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="38"> 'I would, yes.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="39"> Provided they had ethical counselling and there was detailed ethical investigation of their background'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="40"> Patients usually came on referral, their backgrounds known.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="41"> But he recalled that one would-be patient turned out to be a lesbian.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="42"> Should there be an age limit?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="43"> Prof Edwards quoted the Biblical story of Sarah, and observed that the oldest 'artificial' pregnancy to date was of a woman of 61 or 62.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="44"> 'Between 50 and 60 the medical risks to mother and child are no greater than those of a younger woman, with proper care.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="45"> Had there been medical or scientific contra-indications I would have said this is out.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="46"> But I have not seen those contra-indications.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="47"> 'It has moved from being a scientific question to a social one.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="48"> And I feel very strongly that individual liberties here are being threatened.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="49"> I see no reason why a woman of 60 should not have a baby.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="50"> I don't know if I would go to 70 or not.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="51"> I always say: 'Ask the question when you know the work can be done'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="52"> Should people be able to choose the baby's colour?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="53"> 'If they say they do not let the colour of skin affect their relationships with anybody, that they are non-racist, then you should not mind if a white lady wishes to have a black baby'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="54"> Can't you see any ethical objection?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="55"> 'Not really.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="56"> If two white patients come and ask for a black baby I would wonder about that.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="57"> But if it's a white man and black woman, as it usually is, and the colour of the child is very obviously going to be a problem, then provided they were counselled, I would say very well'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="58"> What about choosing sex?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="59"> 'Again, I think I must be very liberal: I do not see any great dangers in choosing the sex of your children provided certain controls are exercised: the most serious thing that can happen is that you will get an imbalance of sexes as in China.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="60"> But the most interesting aspect, which is never discussed, is what the children would say and feel if they knew they had been chosen as boys or girls by their parents'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="61"> Edwards himself is the father of five girls, of whom two are non-identical twins.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="62"> He would not, however, seek to create twins 'to order'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="63"> We discussed the problems of medical consent and I asked him whether, paradoxical as it might sound, a child could have rights even before its conception.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="64"> 'I am increasingly thinking so.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="65"> It is quite clear in American law and increasingly in British law that the foetus has rights'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="66"> These rights 'matured' at birth, he explained, and children had been able to sue for damage in utero, even for 'wrongful birth' if they emerged grossly abnormal.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="67"> Do women have a right to bear their own children?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="68"> 'The right to have a baby is not absolute.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="69"> There are no absolutes.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="70"> But I think the transmission of generations is one of the most fundamental areas of human activity'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="71"> Our notion of rights and duties has come from the Judaeo-Christian tradition but in today's secular society it is framed, ultimately, by Parliament.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="72"> Edwards said he had been impressed by the sophistication of debates, especially in the House of Lords.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="73"> 'I think our democracy does give us the basis for open and fair discussion.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="74"> We have to tolerate the newspaper headlines and the pressures.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="75"> And that, by the way, is incredibly difficult and exhaust-ing.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="76"> 'But if you enter a field like this it is part of what you must expect.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="77"> You can no longer work in isolation in the laboratory.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="78"> You must accept the implications of your own decisions and defend them.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="79"> It is very wise to take advice from the ethical committee as soon as possible'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="80"> Have you been accused of bending your ethics to suit your profession?</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="81"> 'As far as I know, the opinions I gave in 1971 and after have not changed at all.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="82"> One always fears, being stuck close to a field all one's life, that you start making decisions that aren't being examined critically enough.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="88"> Another was implanting human embryos in animals.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="89"> He would also be very wary of genetically 'typing' foetuses if that meant them being marked down for abortion.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12431" num="90"> Better, he said, to intervene and attempt to cure the genetic abnormality.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="8"> Like the Baby M case, this dispute raises controversial questions concerning reproductive rights.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="9"> And like the Baby M case, this dispute is unlikely to solve any of them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="10"> Mary Sue Davis and her former husband, Junior Lewis Davis, wanted to have a child.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="11"> Because Mrs. Davis could not conceive normally, the couple opted for in vitro fertilization -- so-called test-tube fertilization -- where egg and sperm are united in a laboratory and surgically implanted in the woman's uterus.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="12"> Part of the way through this process, after fertilization and before implantation of seven of the fertilized eggs, the marriage fell apart and the couple decided to divorce.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="13"> Mrs. Davis now wants to gain possession of the embryos, hoping to use them to have a child in the future.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="14"> Mr. Davis doesn't want her to bear his children without his consent.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="15"> The case raises many larger questions: Does Mr. Davis have the same rights over the embryos as Mrs. Davis because their genetic contribution was equal?</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="16"> Or does Mrs. Davis have greater rights because she can put the embryos to use and Mr. Davis cannot?</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="17"> Or do the rights of the parents shrink in comparison to the rights of the embryos who, as potential human beings, have been accorded full legal status in some states?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="18"> The judge, who has said repeatedly that this case has no direct legal precedents, has several avenues of response.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="19"> One is to consider the case as a standard divorce case and the embryos as any other piece of marital property.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="20"> Another would be to follow the reasoning of a California appellate court that ruled last year that persons who give biological material to medical institutions retain rights over that material.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="21"> In that case, Mr. Davis would retain at least equal right over the embryos.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="22"> Finally, the judge could turn to law concerning custody of children in divorce cases, determining what decision would be in the "best interests" of the Davises' potential children.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="23"> The answers to such questions have enormous implications for reproductive ethics.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="24"> Should the judge decide that the well-being of the embryos supersedes the claims of both adults, that would raise questions about the morality of abortion.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="25"> If the father is granted some say in the fate of the embryos, then that would raise larger issues about paternal consent for abortion and the rights of sperm donors.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="26"> If the mother is accorded full powers over the embryos, the ruling would raise questions about fathers' parental rights.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="27"> But although this case raises such sweeping questions, it is unlikely to resolve them.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="28"> In the Baby M case, the judge resorted to straight contract law to make his ruling.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="29"> Similarly, the Davises are likely to reach a satisfactory legal solution that sidesteps the moral issues -- Mr. Davis could relinquish all future rights or responsibilities over any children born from the embryos, for instance, and Mrs. Davis would gain control over the embryos in return for giving up the right to ask her former husband for child support.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="30"> As long as the judge does not grant the embryos legal status -- which would go far beyond existing law -- this case will be just one more dispute that spurs public debate and reveals how deep are society's uncertainties about reproduction in this technologically confused era.</s>

<s docid="LA081289-0012" num="31"> The answers to the larger questions will come about only after long deliberation -- not by one nervous judge in one Tennessee courtroom but by society as a whole.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="10"> Rhonda Gale took a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Chicago one day in early 1989, arriving in Chicago just as the sun was rising.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="11"> Carrying a cooler containing vials of her husband's blood, Gale climbed into a limousine and was driven to the University of Chicago Medical School.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="12"> Medical staff there took the blood from Gale and, several hours later, injected a mixture containing Philip Klein's white blood cells under the skin on Gale's arm.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="13"> She flew home the same day.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="14"> After several months and a second trip to Chicago, Gale and Klein were on their way to achieving a long-held dream: Gale soon became pregnant.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="15"> And after three previous miscarriages, this pregnancy resulted in the birth of twin girls.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="16"> Gale and Klein are among a growing number of couples seeking a new and controversial treatment for repeated miscarriage.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="17"> Called paternal leukocyte immunization, the treatment involves transferring immune-boosting white blood cells from the potential father to the potential mother before conception in order to improve the chances that the mother's body won't reject the fetus.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="18"> Candidates for the treatment are couples who have had three or more unexplained miscarriages early in the pregnancy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="19"> While the treatment is still under investigation, it offers some hope in an area of obstetrics that has been one of the last to benefit from a wide range of new reproductive technologies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="20"> Scientists have realized astounding success in the last decade in the treatment of infertility.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="21"> Through advances in surgery, hormone therapy, in vitro fertilization, donation of eggs and sperm and surrogacy, the process of getting people pregnant now holds many options.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="22"> But staying pregnant can present another problem.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="23"> When the cause of miscarriage is known, treatment is often available to improve the chance of a successful pregnancy.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="24"> But for unexplained miscarriage, physicians traditionally could only tell couples to keep trying or consider artificial insemination with donor sperm.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="25"> "Recurrent pregnancy loss is something of an orphan among medical specialties," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="29"> There hasn't been a good place for patients to go".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="30"> Beyond the issue of treatment, the emotional aftermath of miscarriage and its effect on couples who desperately want children has been ignored by the medical profession, says Susan Speraw, a registered nurse and doctoral candidate who is studying the subject for her thesis at the California School of Professional Psychology.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="31"> "There really is no literature on the psychological aspects of miscarriage.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="32"> It's like a nonentity," she says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="33"> "I think the general concept is that because the pregnancy is lost so early it doesn't have much meaning to the couple".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="34"> Speraw's ongoing study of couples who have experienced early miscarriages shows most feel a loss -- "even if it's just a loss of hopes and dreams".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="35"> In recent years researchers have learned that miscarriage is exceedingly common.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="36"> Most pregnancies spontaneously end within the first 28 days, before a woman usually knows she's pregnant.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="37"> Of pregnancies that are confirmed by a physician, another 15% to 25% end in miscarriage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="38"> About half of those miscarriages are due to genetic defects of the fetus or structural problems that prevent the mother from carrying the fetus, such as a weakened uterus or cervix or hormonal problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="39"> Another large group of couples -- several thousand, according to fertility experts -- experience repeated miscarriages for unknown reasons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="40"> Despite the important advance that paternal leukocyte immunization might represent, some fertility experts are concerned that couples are seeking the treatment before studies have shown that it actually works or why it works.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="41"> "It's at a semi-experimental status," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="42"> Susan Cowchock, a researcher at Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia who has been using the technique for about five years.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="43"> "There is plenty of evidence that it's helpful, but I don't think anyone would feel it's standardized treatment yet".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="44"> Several thousand couples worldwide -- many in England -- have undergone the therapy.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="45"> But only a few small, controlled studies have compared the success of couples treated with paternal leukocyte immunization to untreated couples, says Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="46"> D. Ware Branch, an assistant professor at the University of Utah.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="47"> At Utah, physicians are attempting to conduct a large, controlled, double-blind study but are having trouble attracting couples to the study because the couples fear they might be assigned to the untreated control group.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="48"> Yet Branch says the study is necessary because evidence is lacking that the treatment works.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="49"> "I think we don't really know if it works," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="50"> "Physicians over the years have felt confident about things that haven't panned out.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="51"> I think (the interest) is well- intentioned, but circumstantial evidence often doesn't hold up to closer scrutiny".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="52"> The treatment was first suggested in 1981 in research published by a British physician, W.P.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="53"> Faulk, and Chicago physician Alan Beer, who treated Gale.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="54"> Both physicians were interested in studies that show immunological factors play an important role in establishing a successful pregnancy.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="55"> And researchers say the studies related to paternal leukocyte immunization could illuminate basic mysteries of the immune system.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="56"> Normally, the human body rejects foreign material.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="57"> Organ transplants, for example, are rejected unless the patient receives special, potent drugs to prevent the body from recognizing the organ as foreign tissue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="58"> Since a fetus has half its genetic material from its father, a woman's body -- theoretically -- should react to the fetus as foreign material.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="59"> Because that usually doesn't happen, pregnancy has long been a source of wonderment to biologists.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="60"> Years of studies have suggested that the mother's body secretes protective antibodies in response to the fetus that keeps the fetus from being rejected by her immune system.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="61"> Changes in the mother's immune response during pregnancy have been detected, but experts disagree on which of these might be the protective factors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="62"> "Somehow this baby that is half the father sits there and grows," Boyer says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="63"> "I've always been fascinated by that process".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="64"> Because of this paradox, some experts suggest that couples with repeated, unexplained miscarriages have similar immune system characteristics that somehow interfere with the normal protective mechanism.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="65"> If the father and mother share similar immune system characteristics, "the baby, ironically, is not different enough so the mother doesn't recognize it enough to lay down the protective layer," says David Hill, laboratory director at the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital, whose program is an adjunct to Beer's popular program in Chicago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="66"> "This condition can be tested for by taking blood from the husband and the wife to see if this type of sharing phenomenon occurs," Hill says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="67"> Receiving an injection of the potential father's blood -- in effect, an immunization -- causes numerous responses in the woman's body, not all of which are understood, Boyer says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="68"> But when the "immunized" woman becomes pregnant, her body apparently recognizes the genetic material and responds appropriately to protect the baby.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="69"> "Her body has learned from the immunization to recognize her husband's cells and respond appropriately," Boyer says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="70"> "But no one seems to know how it actually works".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="71"> Cowchock says the explanation is not that simple.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="72"> "(The treatment) may have nothing to do with interaction between the husband and wife," she says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="73"> "No one knows why it might be helpful.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="74"> It might be helpful in a mild way".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="75"> While similar genetic material between the mother and father might be part of the problem, something else is probably going wrong in the mother's ability to recognize the fetus, Boyer says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="76"> "The going theory now seems to be that's it's a recognition problem," she says.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="77"> "(The fetus) has to be recognized and there has to be a response".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="78"> Despite the mystery of how it works, Cowchock and other researchers say their studies show that couples who undergo the treatment have a 75% to 80% chance of carrying their next pregnancy to term.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="79"> But statistics show that women who have had three miscarriages have a 30% to 40% chance of carrying the next pregnancy to term without any treatment.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="80"> So it's impossible to know if the treatment helped couples or if they would have been successful anyway, Boyer says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="81"> "Thirty to 40% are going to be successful anyway," Boyer says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="82"> But a growing number of patients are true believers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="83"> Gale and Klein began trying to conceive in 1986.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="84"> Because Gale had endometriosis, a condition of abnormal tissue growth outside the uterus, the couple underwent a procedure called gamete intra-Fallopian transfer, or GIFT, in late 1987.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="85"> GIFT involves placing a mixture of eggs and sperm in the Fallopian tube.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="86"> Gale, an attorney, got pregnant three times with GIFT but miscarried all three times.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="87"> After the third miscarriage, Gale made an appointment with an adoption lawyer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="88"> "I'd had enough," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="89"> "I had been tested for everything.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="90"> I knew something was the matter, but no one could figure out what it was".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="91"> But while pursuing adoption, Gale and Klein heard about paternal leukocyte immunization.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="92"> They shipped blood samples to Beer and were informed that the treatment might help them.</s>

<s docid="LA102990-0096" num="93"> Blood types do not matter except where the mother has an Rh negative blood type while the father is Rh positive, which could lead to complications.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="8"> A decade ago, there were just two in vitro fertilization programs in the United States to help infertile couples conceive.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="9"> Today, the American Fertility Society reports there are 192 IVF programs across the nation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="10"> But nowhere, says the society, is the baby-making boom bigger than in Southern California, home to at least 18 IVF centers, most based in hospitals or universities.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="11"> "If you're suffering from infertility, this is the place to be," said David Hill, laboratory director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="12"> But with the multitude of choices comes a dilemma: how to select the best center?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="13"> Often, patients are sent to a particular center by a gynecologist, usually when a couple has not conceived after a year of intercourse without birth control.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="14"> Sometimes, couples search for a center on their own.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="15"> Either way, experts agree, couples should prepare themselves for the search as seriously as they would prepare for parenthood.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="16"> To make an informed choice, couples should ask many questions about the programs they are considering.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="17"> Here are some basic ones to ask:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="18"> * What are the qualifications of the physicians?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="19"> "The ideal is to see a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist or someone with comparable training," said Joyce Zeitz, spokeswoman for the American Fertility Society.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="20"> * Does the center devote full-time to fertility patients?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="21"> "Timing can be vital in infertility treatment," said Zeitz.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="22"> "You want to be sure someone is available for you when you need a particular procedure".</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="23"> It may be psychologically easier to go to a specialized fertility center, she added, since many infertile women may be uncomfortable sharing a waiting room with pregnant patients.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="24"> * What is the range of services?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="25"> Most IVF centers offer a wide range of services, collectively known as assisted reproductive technology, or ART.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="26"> In IVF, for instance, the egg and sperm are combined in the laboratory and incubated before the embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="27"> In another procedure, GIFT (Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer) the eggs and sperm are transferred to the woman's fallopian tube to allow fertilization to take place there.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="28"> * What is the success rate?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="29"> Experts agree this is the trickiest question and consumers need to ask it very specifically -- and in different ways.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="30"> Ask: What is the overall success rate?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="31"> "The national delivery rate for the IVF technique is 12%," said Zeitz.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="32"> "Reproductively normal couples, in comparison, have a 30% chance of conceiving and carrying to term in a single cycle".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="33"> Ask: "How many patients have you treated with my particular problem in my age group?," Zeitz suggested.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="34"> "What are their success rates"?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="35"> Be aware that many factors influence success rates.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="36"> A woman under 35, for example, whose partner has no fertility problems will probably do better than a woman over age 40 whose partner has sperm problems, Hill said.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="37"> There is yet another way to ask about success rates, said Dr. Arthur Wisot, staff physician at the In Vitro Fertilization Center at South Bay Hospital, Redondo Beach, and co-author of "New Options for Fertility": "How many pregnancies and live births have you achieved in how many tries over one year's time"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="38"> * Does the program include psychological support services?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="39"> "This is an extremely stressful treatment," said Wisot, "and the couple needs ongoing emotional support".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="40"> * What are the fees?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="41"> Cost is a factor, experts agree, especially since insurance often does not reimburse for costs of fertility treatments.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="42"> But fees should not be the overriding factor in the selection process.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="43"> * Where is the center located?</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="44"> Consider how far the center is from work or home.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="45"> "During the first few weeks, there are many tests and procedures," said Hill.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="46"> So, if two centers seem equally efficient, he suggests choosing the closer one.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="47"> Choosing an IVF center may one day be easier.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="48"> Last month, Rep. Ron Wyden (D -- Ore).</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="49"> introduced legislation to regulate the nation's IVF centers.</s>

<s docid="LA080790-0131" num="50"> His proposed Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act is under preliminary review, according to Wyden's Washington office.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="9"> A renowned expert on child psychiatry testified Thursday that he does not believe surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson became emotionally attached to the baby she delivered for an infertile couple, and said he would be wary of giving her custody of the child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="10"> Dr. Justin D.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="11"> Call, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at UC Irvine, said he is suspicious of Johnson's claim to a deep bond with the infant because of a statement she made in a newspaper interview and a letter she wrote to the baby's genetic parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="12"> Johnson, 29, is the first surrogate mother in the nation to seek parental rights to a child not genetically related to her.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="13"> Her lawyer is already predicting she will lose in Orange County Superior Court because emotions in the case are overshadowing the legal issues.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="14"> But he feels certain of victory on appeal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="15"> In the July 23 letter to Mark and Crispina Calvert, the infertile couple who hired her, Johnson threatened to keep the baby unless they immediately paid her the rest of her $10,000 fee.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="16"> Call said Johnson's use of phrases such as "before your child is born" and "the child of someone else" indicates that she had not become attached to the baby.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="17"> Johnson told The Los Angeles Times in early August, when she was seven months' pregnant, that she did not feel bonded to the fetus because it was not made from her genetic material.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="18"> The embryo implanted in her uterus was made from the Calverts' sperm and egg.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="19"> "If it had been my egg, it would have made a real big difference," Johnson said at the time.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="20"> "But with (in-vitro fertilization), there's no connection to me.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="21">. . . There's been detachment from the baby from Day 1" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="22"> Call, who testified for the Calverts in their bid for permanent custody of the boy born Sept. 19, said Johnson's statement "very clearly supports the idea that the mother has not made an attachment to the child".</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="23"> Lack of bonding by seven months into the pregnancy would "carry a very bad prognosis for continuing attachment after birth," Call said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="24"> "A reasonable person should be very circumspect about giving a woman full responsibility for a child she had not made a normal attachment to during pregnancy," Call testified.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="25"> The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="26"> LaFlamme, elicited Call's analysis of Johnson's letter and her statement to The Times in an attempt to explore the validity of her claim to true bonding with the baby.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="27"> Johnson now denies saying that she did not feel attached to the baby.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="28"> She argues that she is entitled to legal parental status because she carried and delivered the child, and because infant-mother bonding is more important than an agreement she signed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="29"> Johnson's lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert, sought to have a Times reporter and photographer excluded from the court as potential witnesses about Johnson's statements, and then expanded his request to include all news media.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="30"> But Superior Court Judge Richard N.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="31"> Parslow Jr. denied the requests.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="32"> The Calverts' attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, tried to undermine Johnson's claims by asking Call if infants form bonds of affection toward their gestational mothers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="33"> Call testified that although there is ample evidence to show that most women develop deep feelings for their babies, there is none to demonstrate similar sentiments in an infant.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="34"> That contradicted an expert who testified Tuesday for Johnson, saying that several studies indicate that infants form powerful emotional bonds to their birth mothers.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="35"> Dr. David B.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="36"> Chamberlain said that if 12 mothers were assembled in the courtroom jury box, a newborn could recognize the woman who bore him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="37"> Although Call acknowledged that an unrelated gestational mother plays an "obvious" role in nourishing the fetus, he minimized that contribution, saying a child's genetic makeup determines most of its future form and development.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="38"> He said the baby's strongest connections are to its genetic parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="39"> Call advocated that custody be awarded to the Calverts, saying that it is more important for a child to be with his genetic parents than with the unrelated woman who delivered him, because much of a child's sense of identity is derived from knowing his relatives.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="40"> A "shared parenting" arrangement, such as the one Johnson seeks, in which all three adults would help raise the baby, could be upsetting to the child because he could be caught between conflicting sets of values or parenting styles, Call said.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="41"> That kind of upset could impair the boy's ability to form bonds with others in the future, Call said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="42"> During cross-examination, Gilbert attacked Call's assessment of Johnson's bond to the baby, saying that surrogate mothers who feel ready to relinquish their children at birth have been subjected to "mind-control programs".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="43"> Gilbert asked for Call's opinion on Johnson's use of the news media to publicize her case.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0150" num="44"> Posing the question as a hypothetical situation, Gilbert said the birth mother feared her baby would be taken from her, so she "left a trail of bread crumbs" -- notified reporters.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="9"> To infertile couples, the Johnson v.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="10"> Calvert decision promises brave new babies created in petri dishes, incubated in hired wombs and handed over to their genetic parents -- all under the protection of the law.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="11"> To surrogation foes, the decision heralds "a modern version of reproductive slavery" in which poor women will become "breeders" for rich couples.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="12"> But to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, Monday's decision granting exclusive custody to genetic parents Mark and Crispina Calvert means that she may never again see the baby she carried.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="13"> There was absolute silence in the packed courtroom Monday as Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard N.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="14"> Parslow Jr. explained his decision to favor nature over nurture in defining parenthood.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="15"> Outside the courtroom, the decision created an instant uproar, with lawyers, scholars, surrogate-brokers and ethicists all sharply divided by the decision.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="16"> All agreed, however, that Parslow's reliance on rights of the genetic parents will shape surrogation rulings for some time to come.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="17"> "It certainly is a landmark decision, and it gives a new description or a new interpretation on who is a mother," said Ralph Fagen, director of the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="18"> "The reaction we are getting from infertile couples is ecstatic.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="19"> Today was the first public, official affirmation of what parental rights are".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="20"> Fagen said the case has drawn interest from would-be surrogates as well as from infertile couples.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="21"> He said the number of women applying to the center as surrogates has nearly doubled since the Johnson case was filed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="22"> "People have felt that Anna Johnson had wronged this couple," Fagen said.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="23"> William W.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="24"> Handel, Fagen's partner, said that at least one couple had been waiting until Parslow's decision to go ahead with a surrogation contract and that now they will proceed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="25"> However, Jeremy Rifkin, founder of the National Coalition Against Surrogacy in Washington, D.C., called the decision "outrageous," warned that it would exacerbate racial tensions, and vowed that he would work to have it overturned.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="26"> "It is a modern version of reproductive slavery," Rifkin said.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="27"> "We will now have poor black women being used as breeders or slaves to produce children for white people.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="28"> The baby brokers and clients are going to be relying on poor blacks.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="29"> We will redouble our efforts to bring the black leadership and the civil rights leaders in this country into this battle".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="30"> Handel, whose standard surrogation contract was used by the Calverts, rejected the argument that hiring surrogates is exploitive.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="31"> "It's no more exploitive than any other endeavor in which people are compensated for the work they do," Handel said.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="32"> "You can hire a man to be a surgeon.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="33"> You can hire a woman to be a professor.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="34"> You can have men donate semen.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="35"> So you should be able to hire a woman to provide a surrogacy service as well".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="36"> "I want my parental rights," said Johnson, who said she was "heartbroken" by the decision.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="37"> "They've stripped me of my constitutional rights".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="38"> Laywers and ethicists, however, said the genetic link between the natural parents and the child has traditionally been respected, absent evidence that the natural parents are unfit.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="39"> "Biology must count in determining parenthood," said Arthur Caplan, director for biomedical ethics at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="40"> "There are reasons for taking away parental rights, but simply having someone act as a gestational mother. . . should not be sufficient to void the claims of the biological parents" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="41"> "We always prefer the biological parents," said Harvard University law professor Arthur Miller.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="42"> "It's almost like the surrogate has been running upstream against the historical presumption.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="43">. . . What you are talking about with the surrogate is an eight-, nine- or seven-month period of time against the genetic pull" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="44"> The baby's court-appointed attorney, however, sees it more starkly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="45"> "You either have two parents or three parents in this situation, and two parents are better," said attorney Harold LaFlamme, who applauded Parslow's decision.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="46"> In his ruling Monday, Parslow offered suggestions to the California Legislature, which, like others around the nation, has been struggling to establish a code to cover reproductive options that until recently had been unimaginable.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="47"> "The in vitro fertilization genie is out of the bottle, and you're not going to be able to put it back," Parslow said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="48"> Alexander M.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="49"> Capron, a renowed medical ethicist who teaches law and medicine at USC, acknowledged that infertile couples need options but said that forcing a woman to comply with a contract to give up a child she bore "turns a child into a commodity and a woman into a machine".</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="50"> Surrogate mothers should be accorded the same right as women who surrender children for adoption, Capron said: that is, they should have a guaranteed right to change their minds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="51"> "We as a society must recognize the fact that (the surrogate mother) is a flesh-and-blood person and not an incubator," Capron said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="52"> Lori B.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="53"> Andrews, an American Bar Foundation research fellow specializing in reproductive technology, said she believes that Parslow's decision is the proper outcome, but she said she is "uneasy" with its emphasis on genetics as the primary test of parenthood.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="54"> The intent of the parties in a surrogation contract, before the child is conceived, is what should determine parenthood, Andrews said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="55"> "It's an extremely masculine way to view parenthood, to base it all on genetics," Andrews said.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="56"> "The only way to give men parental rights, since they don't physically bear children, is through a genetic tie.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="57"> That's how that body of paternity law evolved.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="58"> But it's not necessarily a good thing to apply the same standard to a birth mother".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="59"> She said the genetics-based logic could work against couples who have children through "embryo donation," in which one couple's fertilized embryo is given to another couple who cannot provide their own sperm and egg.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="60"> In that case, the recipient couple seek to become the parents, but they are unrelated to the baby the female partner carries.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="61"> Johnson's position was buttressed by George J.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="62"> Annas, director of the law, medicine and ethics program at the Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="63"> Annas favors the legal presumption that a birth mother is the legal and natural mother of a child.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="64"> That presumption, he said, provides for an immediate and certain identification of a baby's mother, and it assures the presence of the "mother" to care for the child upon birth, as opposed to a prolonged period of uncertainty should the infant be the object of a parentage dispute.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="65"> Parslow suggested that only women who have carried a child to term should be permitted to enter into surrogation contracts, so that the woman would have had some experience in dealing with the emotions pregnancy brings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="66"> The judge also said he would require the natural mother to be medically unable to bear a child to avoid "a vanity situation of somebody seeking to avoid stretch marks".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="67"> A case involving a fertile woman who wishes nonetheless to have a baby borne by a surrogate would be a "predictable" outcome of the Johnson case, bioethicist Caplan said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="68"> "We know what the ethical problems are.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="69"> We haven't yet shown the societal resolve to come up with some answers, so we are leaving it up to courts," Caplan said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="70"> Without a coherent federal standard, Caplan warned, the 50 states might adopt contradictory policies on surrogation.</s>

<s docid="LA102390-0121" num="71"> "Whether or not you're a parent could be function of which side of the state line you're on".</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="9"> The child born to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, a boy who was delivered into the eye of a legal and emotional hurricane four days ago, went home to his genetic parents Saturday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="10"> The infant's departure from the hospital was as unusual as his test-tube conception, his gestation in the womb of a hired surrogate, and his birth into a potentially precedent-setting custody dispute.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="11"> The still-unnamed newborn left St. Joseph Hospital in Orange at 10:15 a.m., carried out the front doors by a pediatric nurse in a green scrub suit and flanked by a uniformed police officer, a clutch of hospital officials and the baby's court-appointed guardian, William Steiner.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="12"> The infant, wrapped in a striped blanket, was swept past a bank of reporters and photographers and loaded into a borrowed infant seat in Steiner's car.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="13"> Steiner drove the child to the home of Mark and Crispina Calvert, the Orange County couple who hired Johnson to bear their baby.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="14"> Crispina Calvert, 36, said that when Steiner pulled into the driveway, her husband could no longer wait inside.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="15"> The 34-year-old insurance underwriter ran to the front door and out onto the steps, smiling and extending his arms so Steiner could hand him the still-sleeping baby.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="16"> After he crossed the threshold of the Calverts' home, the infant's life began to look a little more traditional.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="17"> A houseful of relatives leaned over him, talking baby talk and watching rapturously as his diaper was changed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="18"> "We're just so jubilant we have our child," Calvert said.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="19"> "We appreciate Anna Johnson's consideration and we're extremely grateful for her compassion in this situation".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="20"> Johnson, who was staying with friends in Mission Viejo, waited patiently until late Saturday afternoon, when she and her 3-year-old daughter, Erica, visited the baby at the Calverts' home.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="21"> Steiner, who will monitor Johnson's visits with the baby, said the session was "tense and awkward at first" but went "fine" after that.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="22"> As an icebreaker, Johnson gave the Calverts a rum cake.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="23"> "I sort of got the feeling that this baby was. . . the peacemaker," Steiner said.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="24"> "The attention just focused on the baby and away from all the acrimony and problems .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="25"> "She changed the baby and held the baby and the baby slept a good part of the time," Steiner continued, adding that Johnson spent some time alone with the infant and also visited with the Calverts, discussing the baby's birth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="26"> Johnson also had pictures taken of herself with the baby, just as the Calverts had done in the hospital the night he was born.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="27"> Looking upbeat after the visit, Johnson smiled but would only say she was "fine" as she left the home.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="28"> Johnson's attorney, who drove her to the home, said he wanted to respect the Calverts' privacy and preferred that she not comment after the visit.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="29"> Ironically, it was Johnson -- who is battling the Calverts for shared custody -- who made certain that the baby went home with the couple.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="30"> During a five-hour session with a judge Friday, the parties could not agree on who should take the infant home temporarily, until another custody hearing could be held.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="31"> When her lawyer called her at the hospital to say that the judge was about to place the boy in a foster home for a short while, Johnson decided that it was better for the baby to be with the Calverts.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="32"> Johnson's attorney, Richard C. Gilbert, said he plans to seek an order from the state Court of Appeal Wednesday or Thursday placing the baby with Johnson and declaring that she has parental rights equal to those of the Calverts.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="33"> If the court agrees to hear the case, a custody hearing Thursday in Orange County Superior Court would be postponed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="34"> Johnson, 29, is the first surrogate mother to ask a judge to declare that she is the legal parent of a child that is not genetically related to her.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="35"> She agreed to be implanted with an embryo made from the Calverts' sperm and egg.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="36"> She later backed out of the $10,000 contract and sought to keep the child, saying the Calverts had neglected her during pregnancy and would make unfit parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="37"> The Calverts are unable to bear children because Crispina Calvert's uterus had to be removed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="38"> Gilbert said Johnson, a single mother, rode home from the hospital in silence Friday night and was in an emotionally delicate state Saturday.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="39"> He said her 3-year-old daughter had nightmares Friday night because she "wonders what happened to her baby brother".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="40"> Johnson will probably have to stop breast-feeding the baby, Gilbert said, because arrangements would be difficult and she feels that the Calverts do not want her to bring breast milk for the baby.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="41"> Although Johnson is "very comfortable with the decision she made" Friday, she would prefer to have the baby living with her, and she still wants a court to declare her a legal parent and affirm what she believes is her right to participate in raising the baby, Gilbert said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="42"> Mark Calvert, meanwhile, said his wife was so overjoyed she "won't put the baby down.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="43"> He's constantly in her arms".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="44"> After the court hearing Friday, the couple stopped and bought diapers and a baby bottle on the way home.</s>

<s docid="LA092390-0207" num="45"> Crispina Calvert said she dashed out Saturday morning and, in a half-hour shopping spree, bought a white changing table, a baby monitor, an infant bathing tub and a few tiny T-shirts.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101890-0055" num="41"> If parentage is unresolved, the civil code dictates that blood tests provide the conclusive answer, and in that case, Johnson has no claim to parentage because she has no genetic relationship to the baby, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101890-0055" num="42"> That leaves her with only one other argument, which is the bond she claims to have formed with the child, LaFlamme said.</s>

<s docid="LA101890-0055" num="43"> That assertion is suspect because she has made contradictory claims to others and "suppressed vital information" from the Calverts to make certain they used her as a surrogate, LaFlamme said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101890-0055" num="44"> Van Deusen also attacked Johnson's claim of developing a bond with the baby, saying she has no sincere interest in raising the child and was pressing her lawsuit for national attention as well as a chance to make money off a possible book or movie deal.</s>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="273"> Sure candidates for abortion are the most severe abnormalities, such as anencephaly, or the disastrous, inherited metabolic and chromosomal diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease and Trisomy 13 and 18, in which an extra chromosome produces severe retardation and babies who frequently don't live longer than one year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="274"> But because prenatal screening cannot predict the severity of a defect such as Down's syndrome, many couples are thrown into a moral quagmire.</s>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="275"> Some children with Down's lead fairly normal, happy lives, and some suffer a lifetime of chronic disability, creating enormous hardship on their families.</s>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="283"> Personally, he does not perform abortions as part of his practice, except for selective terminations of multiple pregnancies -- which usually involve far-less-developed fetuses.</s>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="300"> When the procedure is done to reduce the number of fetuses, it is done early in the pregnancy, before it is possible to detect genetic anomalies.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="302"> After he terminated one fetus in a set of triplets not long ago, lab tests revealed that the aborted triplet had Down's syndrome.</s>

<s docid="LA042389-0005" num="304"> "I'm sure one day somebody's going to terminate a normal baby and leave an abnormal one behind," Tabsh says.</s>
