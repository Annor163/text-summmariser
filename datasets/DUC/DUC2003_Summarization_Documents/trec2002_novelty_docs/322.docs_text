<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="9"> It is believed to be one of the largest confiscations ever of suspected fraudulent art, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="10"> Gates said Thursday after detectives seized more than 1,600 art prints and other works in a series of raids touched off by the arrest of an art dealer trying to peddle a phony Renoir.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="11"> Officers, with help from the district attorney's office and the FBI, searched eight outlets of the Upstairs Gallery art store chain in West Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="12"> The vast bulk of the seized works came from the firm's warehouse in Huntington Beach, officers said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="13"> The raids began Wednesday night with the arrest of a Manhattan Beach art dealer who allegedly tried to sell a fake Renoir for $3.2 million to an undercover police officer posing as a Japanese businessman during a meeting in the Little Toyko section of downtown Los Angeles.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="14"> The dealer, a French national named Frank De Marigny, 38, was arrested and booked for investigation of grand theft.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="15"> He was held at the Parker Center jail in lieu of $1 million bail.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="16"> Nightlong Operations</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="17"> After the arrest, officers fanned out to the galleries.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="18"> The search and seizure operations lasted through daybreak Thursday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="19"> The 10 search locations included De Marigny's beachfront home, where officers recovered several paintings and an assault rifle, and the Marina del Rey residence of another person, who was not arrested.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="20"> The massive haul turned a property storage room at police headquarters into a virtual art gallery, with lithographs stacked to the rafters.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="21"> Other suspected phony works attributed to such prominent artists as Marc Chagall, Joan Miro and Rufino Tamayo were displayed to the media as Gates hailed the work of the search teams.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="22"> "These intrepid enforcers of the law saved people who are art lovers a great deal of money" by making the confiscations, the chief said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="23"> Overall, officers seized 1,687 lithographs believed to be fraudulent, with about 1,200 of them taken from the Huntington Beach warehouse, said Detective Bill Martin, the department's art sleuth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="24"> Some of the alleged fakes retailed in art galleries at upwards of $50,000 each, with a total value of about $15 million.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="25"> Martin said he believes that the overnight raids may have netted the most suspected fraudulent lithographs ever seized.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="26"> Neither Gates nor Martin could estimate how many unsuspecting art buyers may have already purchased phony prints, saying only that rising demand for art in general has led to millions of dollars of fraud.</s>
</P>
<P>

<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="27"> Won't Explain Relationship</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="28"> Also, they said they could not explain the relationship of independent dealer De Marigny to the Upstairs Gallery chain without jeopardizing the continuing investigation.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="29"> Gates said detectives were still checking to see whether anyone in the firm's management is linked to the alleged fraud.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="30"> A spokeswoman for the Upstairs Gallery said an internal investigation was under way to determine whether the firm was duped into buying fake art.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="31"> "As far as this company is aware, all of the prints which the company purchased from its sources are believed to be authentic," said Patricia White, the firm's vice president.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="32"> Gates said the case began when detectives found out that De Marigny was offering the painting "Young Girl With Daisies" by French impressionist Pierre Auguste Renoir for sale.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="33"> Investigators immediately were aware that the painting was a fake because the real one hangs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="34"> De Marigny also uses an alias of Frank Orval, and has a clean criminal record, police said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="35"> De Marigny lives in a posh house on The Strand in Manhattan Beach, drives a Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari and is known by art insiders as "Prince Frank," said Dale Sekovich, an investigator for the Federal Trade Commission who has monitored the case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="36"> Although the FTC was not conducting its own investigation into the Upstairs Gallery confiscations, Sekovich said the commission has the power to initiate a civil lawsuit to try to gain restitution for victims of art fraud.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="37"> Martin said some of the allegedly phony artwork seized in the raids appears linked to a Claremont man, criminally charged in August, who was deemed by a district attorney's office spokeswoman to be "one of the largest art forgers on the West Coast, if not the United States".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="38"> The alleged forger, Anthony Gene Tetro, 39, faces 45 felony counts for allegedly fabricating and distributing lithographs of the works of well-known painters.</s>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="39"> Martin said he was free on bail awaiting court proceedings in his case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092989-0086" num="40"> Police initiated their investigation of Tetro's activities after Japanese artist Hiro Yamagata recognized a miniature watercolor being sold under his name as a fake on a stroll through a Beverly Hills gallery.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="6"> The Arts Council is now considering cutting its entire grant to the Theatre Royal, Plymouth unless a response from the Plymouth region can persuade it otherwise by September 22.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="7"> The theatre has already coordinated a campaign of 90,000 signatures and 6,000 letters.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="8"> The quality of recent performances and the quantity of local response should allow the Council to vote a reprieve without losing face.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="9"> The Theatre Royal's most recent play, Master Forger (in repertory until 25 September) starts an autumn season which tables the dependable Les Liaisons Dangereuses alongside the innovative The Doctor and the Devils, a play by Dylan Thomas about Burke and Hare.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="10"> The Theatre Royal's Drum Theatre offers a line in modern classics and midwinter pantomime.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="11"> The balanced programme and sensible scheduling includes visits from the Welsh National Opera, Glyndebourne Touring, London Contemporary Dance Theatre and The Birmingham Royal ballet.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="12"> This breadth makes Plymouth a valuable resource for dance, opera and theatre in the South West.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="13"> Master Forger is a fine new play by Hugh Janes based on the life of the artist Tom Keating (1917-1984).</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="14"> Keating became famous in 1976 for forging Samuel Palmer's paintings.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="15"> But he also forged over 2,000 others.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="16"> These 'Sexton Blakes', slang for 'fakes', as he called them, included Degas, Goya, Modigliani, Rembrandt, Sisley, Van Gogh and Vuillard.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="17"> But he was best at JMW Turner, another consummate professional who was capable in a visit to Venice of turning out 300 sketches in three days.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="18"> In 1977 Keating was charged with conspiracy and fraud in relation to sale of paintings, and early in 1979 the trial, which The Observer described as 'the best free show in town' began.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="19"> Charges against Keating were dropped before the spring.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="20"> Inside five years, he was a national hero, advising on TV and venting his anger against an art establishment which used money alone to value art.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="21"> The play, directed by Roger Redfarn, sticks to the surface of Keating's colourful life like the formaldehyde-varnish he used for ageing paintings.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="22"> Roy Marsden as the bohemian cockney delivers a fine performance which shows how the artist was in some sense possessed by the Old Masters, and how his promiscuous reading emerged as a series of lectures in court: 'The only thing that amazes me is that I wasn't exposed in the press a lot sooner'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="23"> Marsden's voice is superb, ringing around the revolving set, pleading with the audience, imparting information or directing models.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="24"> Fakes are the way forward.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="25"> Umberto Eco's Faith in Fakes has a scene where a California sculpture garden shows the Venus de Milo with both arms.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2068" num="26"> Maybe now she can write to Arts Council on behalf of Plymouth.</s>

<s docid="LA102789-0118" num="8"> Los Angeles police art fraud investigators Thursday searched the home of Larry Groeger, one of the West Coast's leading wholesalers of popular prints, and discovered records showing that Groeger supplied "fraudulent" artworks to a popular chain of galleries raided last month, the chief investigator said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102789-0118" num="9"> Detective William Martin said business records seized during the search of Groeger's Hollywood home showed that the 39-year-old businessman was the distributor of the Marc Chagall and Joan Miro prints confiscated during the earlier raid on the Upstairs Gallery chain.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="23"> "I was impressed that he seems to have accomplished so much at such a young age.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="24"> He's a baby.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="25"> I've got ties older than that".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="26"> Others see his case as another example of 1980s excess turned sour in 1990.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="27"> He has plenty of foes delighted at his fall.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="28"> Said one: "He was looking to make as much money as he could and he played with fire and got caught".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="29"> Charming, with a quick mind and a broad smile, Lerner said he has been humbled in the 18 months since his arrest -- in part through a new-found devotion to his religion, Judaism, that takes him to synagogue five times a week.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="30"> Lerner's cooperation with authorities in the art fraud case -- he initiated the relationship the month after he pleaded guilty to the cocaine charge -- has enabled him to delay his sentencing for nine months.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="31"> His lawyer is expected to argue today that Lerner deserves credit, in the form of a lighter sentence, for his help.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="32"> The information Lerner gave authorities helped them arrest two men he did business with: Lee Sonnier, the former manager of the Rodeo Drive branch of the Upstairs Gallery art chain; and independent art broker Frank De Marigny, who earlier this month pleaded no contest to charges of perjury, grand theft and forgery stemming from the investigation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="33"> The Sonnier and De Marigny cases sent tremors through the world of Beverly Hills arts traders, raising fears that high-priced paintings might be bogus and generally casting a shadow of distrust over the buying and selling of art.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="34"> Lerner has not been charged with any crime involving phony art.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="35"> He was granted immunity -- although he said he did not need it -- in exchange for the testimony he would have given had De Marigny gone to trial.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="36"> Authorities allege that, in addition to other dealings, Sonnier and De Marigny conspired to sell a fake Renoir painting to a Japanese businessman while the original was hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="37"> De Marigny also was charged with trying to sell the same painting to an undercover officer during a sting operation that Lerner arranged last September.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="38"> According to court testimony and other documents, and interviews with his former employees and associates, Lerner acted as a paid broker who helped line up buyers for De Marigny -- who supplied the artwork -- and Sonnier, who sold it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="39"> Lerner told authorities of six instances in which he bought paintings credited to French Impressionists from De Marigny and sold them to Sonnier.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="40"> Five of those pieces -- along with the phony Renoir -- were later purchased by a Japanese businessman who claims the works were either fake or never delivered.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="41"> Lerner said he did not believe the pieces were fake.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="42"> In a civil suit filed against, among others, Lerner, De Marigny and Sonnier, businessman Koichi Akemoto claims he was bilked out of more than $2 million.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="43"> While Lerner denies the allegation, Akemoto's lawyers say they have evidence that Sonnier paid Lerner at least $800,000 last summer -- money that they believe was in return for Lerner's help in procuring phony artworks for their client.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="44"> While Akemoto's civil lawyers are trying to recover money from Lerner, defense lawyers for De Marigny and Sonnier have attempted to paint him as a convicted criminal who pinned blame on their clients because it might help him get a lighter sentence on his cocaine charge.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="45"> Perry Wander, who represented De Marigny in the early stages of the case, said: "I think it's a travesty of justice the way they are prosecuting Frank like gangbusters and Stan is out walking around, selling art.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="46"> I've told the D.A., 'You are prosecuting the wrong guy'. "</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="47"> While prosecutor Reva Goetz, in charge of the art fraud case, declines to discuss the cases, Lerner dismisses such accusations, saying he went to authorities the instant he learned he had sold phony work and that it was only proper for him to do so.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="48"> "My actions speak for themselves," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="49"> But others, including the man who was convicted as Lerner's co-conspirator in the cocaine case, describe him as a tough businessman who fancies himself a high-roller and who, before his arrest, leased a luxurious condominium overlooking Wilshire Boulevard, wore Armani suits, drove Porsches, Mercedeses and a Ferrari, and once displayed a high-powered assault weapon to a friend.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="50"> They are suspicious of Lerner's claim that he has undergone religious transformation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="51"> "When you meet him you are going to be charmed out of your mind," said one business associate.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="52"> "He's very charismatic, very intelligent.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="53"> He's got this big boy smile and you're gonna think, 'How could anyone say anything bad about this guy'? "</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="54"> In two lengthy interviews -- one of them over lunch at a Beverly Hills restaurant where he knew all the waiters and the maitre d' -- Lerner was personable, witty and seemingly eager to talk.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="55"> But there were two things he would not discuss on the record: his cocaine conviction and his role in the art fraud investigation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="56"> Describing himself as an "entrepreneur," Lerner said he established his art business with an initial investment of a few thousand dollars and a bit of help from his friends.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="57"> "Donald Trump has his art of the deal and I have mine," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="58"> "I didn't have money so I either borrowed it or I was very fortunate.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="59"> People helped me".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="60"> Those who know Lerner consider his Trump reference apt.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="61"> They describe him as smart and ambitious, with an ego that knows no bounds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="62"> At Montebello High School, Lerner graduated seventh in a class of 449 students and competed in tennis, water polo and swimming.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="63"> His teachers recall that he was very bright, but once called his parents in to discuss his insubordination.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="64"> "You couldn't tell the kid anything," said Tim Murphy, the school's athletic director and Lerner's former swim coach.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="65"> "It was just like he had the world by the tail.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="66"> He had all the answers".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="67"> Lerner attended UCLA but quit in June, 1985, he said, to help with the family auto parts business when his father became ill.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="68"> He became involved in the art world in September, 1986 -- at the age of 21 -- when he agreed to pay an art publisher, Robert Bane, $30,000 to produce limited edition reproductions.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="69"> Court records show the venture fell apart in a legal dispute.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="70"> By March, 1987, Lerner was leasing more than 2,200 square feet on the 27th floor of one of the Century City Towers on Century Park East, at a cost of nearly $4,800 a month.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="71"> His former lawyer and office mate, Joel Spivak, said Lerner was always dabbling in some new endeavor -- a computerized clearinghouse for art dealers, an at-home AIDS test and the compact disc store.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="72"> But, Spivak added, these ventures never seemed to get very far.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="73"> By November, 1988, Lerner had moved out of the office tower amid a rent dispute and was in prison at Terminal Island.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="74"> He had been arrested by the FBI on allegations that he conspired to distribute five kilograms of cocaine.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="75"> No one involved in the investigation would elaborate.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="76"> Because the case was not tried, no details have emerged.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="77"> Lerner was released when the charges were dropped for lack of evidence.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="78"> The indictment was reinstated and he pleaded guilty last August.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="79"> Lerner said he started working as an art broker shortly after his release from prison.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="80"> He founded Triangle Galleries in April, 1989.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="81"> He would not say how he became involved with De Marigny and Sonnier.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="82"> While some say he earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from their sales, he apparently wasn't paying his bills on time.</s>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="83"> Former employees said paychecks were often late and suppliers were frequently calling for money.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="84"> Paradoxically, this is the same Stan Lerner who now lives with his recently widowed mother in Montebello, who says he gets more enjoyment from praying than from driving his Porsche, who hosts charity fund-raisers, and who once paid a homeless artist to paint in front of his gallery because he felt sorry for him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062590-0134" num="85"> The same Stan Lerner who, when asked if he is worried about going to prison, drinks a sip of mineral water at a Rodeo Drive cafe, takes a deep breath and responds:</s>

<s docid="LA011090-0055" num="11"> The warrant for the arrest of McKelvey on charges of misdemeanor battery and disturbing the peace in the Dec. 8 scuffle with collectors Stuart Herman and Cynthia Berliner was issued last Friday, said Police Lt. Robert Curtis.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011090-0055" num="12"> Curtis said McKelvey has been contacted and is expected to surrender for booking this week.</s>

<s docid="LA011090-0055" num="13"> McKelvey could not be reached for comment Tuesday but earlier had denied any wrongdoing in the incident.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011090-0055" num="20"> McKelvey reportedly told police that a scuffle involving the couple started after they damaged a car parked outside the gallery.</s>

<s docid="LA011090-0055" num="26"> The couple's relationship with the Upstairs Gallery chain dates back to their December, 1987, purchase of a Joan Miro lithograph that was later judged to be phony by their art appraiser.</s>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="10"> More than 1,500 of the expensive prints that art-forgery investigators seized in a raid of an Upstairs Gallery store in Beverly Hills have been deemed authentic by experts hired by the art chain, an attorney for the gallery said Wednesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="11"> But Los Angeles police and district attorney's officials said their investigation into possible criminal art fraud by the gallery continues.</s>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="12"> "We feel that we have a criminal investigation and that there have been numerous forgeries found" among the prints seized by federal and local authorities in a raid of the Rodeo Drive gallery last September, Police Detective William Martin said.</s>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="13"> "Nobody has been charged, but it is still under investigation".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="14"> Police and district attorney's officials declined to comment on the gallery's figures, which show that 1,506 of the 1,648 confiscated works were judged to be authentic by nationally renowned art experts Howard Russeck, Martin Gordon and Bernard Ewell.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="15"> However, sources close to the probe warned that the gallery's numbers could be misleading, because the 1,506 works that the gallery said were authentic actually are copies of a handful of prints.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="16"> Most of the remaining 142 artworks, the sources said, may be forgeries.</s>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="17"> "If one were holding 1,500 images, 1,400 of which were the same image, by the same artist and found to be legitimate," said one source, who asked not to be identified, "that -- contrasted with an additional 100 prints of different images, by different artists and a high percentage of which were fake -- would mean (the gallery's figures) were misleading.</s>

<s docid="LA041290-0157" num="18"> The gallery should give a breakdown by artist.</s>

<s docid="LA061590-0058" num="39"> Korte, the investigator, said these kinds of thefts usually follow a similar pattern, in which art was taken, the thief dies and the heirs try to cash in on the treasure.</s>

<s docid="LA061590-0058" num="40"> In this case, the family members allegedly consulted with a number of experts about two manuscripts.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="10"> Before you are two medieval manuscripts, both painted on vellum, both showing centuries of wear.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="11"> Unfortunately, one is a fake.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="12"> How will you discern which manuscript dates back to medieval times and which was painted by a notorious Spanish forger in the 19th Century?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="13"> You might start by honing your connoisseurship at Pomona College's Montgomery Gallery, where "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger" is on display through Dec. 2.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="14"> The exhibit, which is traveling across the country, was organized by curators at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="15"> At this unusual show, viewers get a glimpse of more than two dozen fakes -- from 16th-Century Russian icons to the "Mona Lisa" to ancient busts of Roman youths.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="16"> In some cases, the fakes are paired with genuine works in the same style.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="17"> Viewers are invited to study them, read about the actual artist's style and background, then choose which piece they think is authentic.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="19"> As compelling as the "whodunit" tests are the cloak-and-dagger tales that accompany the forgeries, many of which have been exhibited as genuine for years.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="20"> For instance, the "Spanish forger" who faked the medieval manuscripts was a highly skilled and clever painter who went to great lengths to disguise his forgeries by using vellum that dated back to the Middle Ages, painting in the style of medieval illuminators and then "aging" his works.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="21"> The forger, who art historians think was actually a Frenchman working in Paris during the Victorian era, went undetected in his own time.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="22"> But 20th-Century art historians notice -- as Montgomery patrons may also -- that the forger was undone by his faces.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="23"> To the contemporary eye, they smack of the cloying sweetness of the Victorian era and do not reflect the more somber, pious style of painters who worked in the Middle Ages.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="24"> Copying important works of art is a practice that dates back to ancient Egypt, says Montgomery Gallery Director Marjorie L.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="26"> The Romans, for instance, loved the classical Greek style and commissioned numerous copies of Greek art that were considered legitimate and highly desirable.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="27"> Other artists were illicitly copied during their own lifetimes.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="28"> Painter and wood engraver Albrecht Durer went to court in the early 16th Century to halt reproductions.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="29"> On the other hand, Rubens and Rembrandt encouraged their students and assistants to copy their work as a way to learn the master's style.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="30"> And Jean Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875) occasionally signed his students' works to help them professionally in their careers, thus muddying the waters for generations of art historians to come.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="31"> As a result, says Harth, practically all Corots -- especially landscapes such as the one represented in the Pomona show -- have come under suspicion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="32"> The public's fascination with art and forgeries may be heightened by the millions of dollars that masterpieces command today on world markets, Harth says.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="33"> A Van Gogh self-portrait in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art was recently removed from display when its authenticity was questioned.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="34"> Ditto the "Kouros," a classical Greek bust of a youth displayed by the J. Paul Getty Museum, which came under suspicion when a very similar sculpture known to be a fake appeared on the market.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="35"> The Pomona show explains the high-tech tools today's art historian uses to detect fakes: X-rays, infrared photographs and pigment analysis.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="36"> One work in the show, a supposed early 16th-Century "Venetian Renaissance" panel painting of St. George slaying the dragon, was revealed as a 19th-Century fake after the Walters Conservation Lab noticed some suspiciously heavy overpainting on the canvas.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="37"> An X-ray revealed a late 16th-Century painting of the Last Supper underneath.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="38"> Subsequent analysis showed that the scene of St. George and the dragon was painted over the earlier work in the 19th Century.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="39"> The curators have removed several sections of the forgery to reveal the head of one of Christ's disciples and the small dog at Christ's feet, giving patrons a fascinating glimpse at a forgery exposed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="40"> In addition to technical tools, historians use their knowledge to match artistic styles and flourishes with the appropriate cultures and epochs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="41"> Harth calls it "the complicated, interrelated workings of eye and brain".</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="42"> Perception, he says, is determined by context, "by the conditions, physical and intellectual, under which we see the work".</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="43"> "Once you know which one is authentic, it will look better than it did, and the one labeled fake will look worse," Harth promises.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="44"> Fakes provide fascinating reference points for art historians.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="45"> Like a slightly warped mirror, they reflect a skewed view of artistic reality -- but as with any illusion, they draw the viewer in.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="46"> "Fakes speak eloquently of fallibility and of gullibility," Harth says.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="48"> Forgers often are unable to transcend the barriers of their own time.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="49"> A bust of a king from ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty is revealed as a fake by the playful, naive and human expression on the face.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="50"> Walters curators say this is greatly at odds with the work of ancient Egyptian stone carvers, who depicted their kings as men of strength and power -- austere, remote and on a plane above mere mortals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="51"> Other times, fakes give themselves away by sloppy inattention to detail.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="52"> A "Gothic" ivory carving in the exhibit was revealed as a fake when scholars noticed that St.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="53"> Catherine is seated in the center, with the apostles Peter and Paul to the sides.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="54"> A true Gothic carver, pious and theologically schooled, would never have ranked a mere saint above the apostles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="55"> Cross-cultural faking is even more difficult than that which attempts to transcend epochs.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="56"> A pink ceramic vessel, allegedly from 18th-Century China's Ching Dynasty, is revealed as a 19th-Century Western European imitation by its lack of subtlety and its inability to reproduce the two-dimensional composition of Asian art popular at that time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="57"> Often, however, forgers are artists in their own right and earn the grudging admiration of art historians for their clever, albeit misplaced, genius.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="58"> Icilio Federico Joni (1866-1946) was a Sienese painter, restorer, art dealer and forger who specialized in Renaissance paintings.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="59"> Joni, who often used panels that dated from the Renaissance to throw historians off the scent, was unmasked because he allowed too many paintings to trace their provenance, or ownership history, back to him.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="60"> In addition, Joni gave all the characters in his paintings the same long, broad noses and elaborate halos.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="61"> Then there was Reinhold Vasters (1827-1909), the nearly perfect forger.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="62"> A master goldsmith from Aachen, Germany, Vasters forged jewelry and decorative works in Renaissance style but was never exposed during his lifetime.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="63"> The forgeries came to light in the early 1980s, when the working drawings for his fakes were discovered in the storerooms of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="64"> Perhaps, say the Walters curators, he left documentation to salve his ego and assure himself that his talent -- and his ability to fool the experts of his time -- would one day be known to all.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="65"> Forgeries aren't always aesthetically inferior, either.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="66"> Of the two Sevres clocks on display at the gallery, Harth says several curators would argue that the fake is actually superior.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="67"> So what, then, is wrong with fakes?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="68"> The Walters curators say: "A discredited work of art can only distort and obscure our view of the past".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="69"> Harth adds that a forgery blemishes the reputation of the real artist and, perhaps more dangerously, creates a false basis of information about the artist and the period in question with which to judge future works.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="70"> What makes Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) great, Harth says, "is not only that he painted beautiful pictures but that he painted certain pictures in a certain way at a certain time in the history and development of art.</s>

<s docid="LA111190-0041" num="71"> In addition to the craftsmanship, technique and cleverness of the painting, it shows genuine creative achievement".</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="7"> SOVIET EMIGRE gangs have been defrauding the German government of hundreds of millions of D-Marks by faking the delivery of consumer goods to the former Soviet armed forces in eastern Germany, according to Berlin police.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="8"> Mr Uwe Schmidt, a superintendent heading the police investigation, estimated yesterday that 'more than DM1bn' (Pounds 340m) had been embezzled out of the DM3bn Germany had agreed to pay for supplies to the former Soviet forces until their withdrawal in 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="9"> The contracts were secured by Soviet emigre gangs, via Soviet officers, and fictitious deliveries were recorded for cigarettes, food, alcohol, hi-fi units, televisions and video recorders for the troops.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="10"> Police say that in a typical case, the gangs bribed Russian officers to order tax-free liquor in bulk for the armed forces from a Berlin company.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="11"> A bill was provided and payment made but the liquor never reached the troops; it was resold on the open market at a higher price.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="12"> The police became aware of the embezzlement scheme because of a flood on to the market of such things as cigarettes, alcohol and electronics goods.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="13"> Large quantities of tax-free cigarettes were ordered at DM4.50 a carton, compared with the German retail price of DM40.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="14"> 'There were enough cigarettes to supply everyone remotely connected with the army including infants and grandmothers,' said Mr Schmidt.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="15"> In many cases the cigarettes were sold to Vietnamese citizens living in east Germany who resold them on the street for DM25 a carton.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="16"> The police also believe that embezzled goods to the value of DM250m were illegally transported to Poland and Russia for resale in the past year.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="17"> The police hope the investigation will lead to prosecutions by the Berlin justice authorities later this year.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="18"> However this may be hampered by the speed with which the companies involved in the fraudulent operations were set up and liquidated.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="19"> Mr Schmidt said: 'We know who the 100 or so perpetrators are.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="20"> They are people who were convicted of counterfeiting, illegal weapons sales and forgery of documents and art objects.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="21"> There is no place left where they can escape'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-9438" num="22"> Most are known to be in Berlin, but no arrests have been made so far because of the complexity of the company operations.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="9"> The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu has removed its prized Greek "Kouros" for study because of new doubts about the authenticity of the statue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="10"> The 6-foot, 8-inch-tall marble sculpture of a young man, thought to date from the 6th Century B.C., is one of the museum's three most celebrated Greek antiquities, along with a monumental marble "Aphrodite" and a bronze "Victorious Athlete".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="11"> The museum in Malibu purchased the "Kouros" -- reportedly for more than $6 million -- in 1985 after 14 months of study and put it on view in 1986 after additional study and conservation at the Getty.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="12"> But a recent discovery of a marble torso that is generally regarded as a forgery or a modern copy has raised new questions about the Getty statue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="13"> The torso, which came to the museum's attention in April, depicts only part of a male nude figure and it differs in surface and general appearance, but it is made of similar marble, "possibly from the same quarry" and it contains "subtle similarities of style and detail," Getty curator Marion True said in a prepared statement Friday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="14"> The museum has purchased the torso from an unidentified private collector who brought it to True's attention.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="15"> The "Kouros" was removed from the antiquities gallery on Friday, and the two pieces will be studied during the next several months in the museum's conservation laboratory, museum director John Walsh said in a telephone interview.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="16"> "Naturally, we will be very disappointed if our new studies lead to the conclusion that the museum's 'Kouros' is not an authentic work," Walsh said, "but it's most important that we try to discover the truth about the two statues.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="17"> "These cases arise in the field, and they occur at this museum as they do in other museums that collect antiquities.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="18"> The main thing is to determine the truth and make it known," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="19"> The situation would seem to be an embarrassment to the wealthy museum, which is often in the news, but Walsh said the "Kouros" affair is more of "a puzzle, though a very prominent puzzle".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="20"> Another, less-prominent sculpture in the Getty's collection -- a marble "Head of Achilles," once thought to be the work of 4th-Century B.C. Greek master Skopus -- was discovered to be a modern copy two years ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="21"> Walsh said the "Kouros" always has presented puzzling questions for the museum.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="22"> Critics have commented on the statue's archaic-style smile and the fact that its stylized hair, eyes and hands contrast with more realistic feet and flesh around the mouth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="23"> In a study published by the museum, True acknowledged that the "Kouros" had "unusual stylistic features," Walsh said.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="24"> Some anatomical forms on the marble appear old-fashioned while others are more up-to-date, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="25"> "That's something that has to be explained.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="26"> Marion weighed the possibility that it might be a forgery on the one hand or that it was done in a slightly provincial style on the other" and decided in favor of the latter interpretation, Walsh said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="27"> Her conclusion was supported by scientific findings that the crust on the surface of the stone had occurred naturally over time and had not been induced by a forger.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="28"> Before the sculpture was installed in the museum's gallery, Stanley Margolis, a geochemist from UC Davis, studied the surface of the marble and Jerry Podany, head of the Getty's antiquities conservation laboratory, ran tests determining that the marble had come from a quarry on the Island of Thasos.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="29"> But the torso has sufficient similarities in the execution of the anatomy to cause the museum to rethink its earlier conclusions, Walsh said.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="30"> He declined to comment on the museum's recourse if the "Kouros" is proven to be a fake.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="31"> "That would be between us and the seller," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="32"> The museum bought the statue at an undisclosed price from a private collector through an unidentified Swiss dealer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="33"> When the "Kouros" was acquired by the museum, it was lauded as an extremely rare acquisition.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="34"> A person with close ties to the museum was quoted in 1987 as saying that the Getty paid more than $6 million for the statue.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="35"> Only about a dozen complete examples of "Kouros" figures are known to exist among about 250 fragmentary works around the world.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="36"> The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is the only other American museum that has a complete "Kouros" in its collection.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="37"> The Met bought its statue in 1932, the last time a "Kouros" had come on the market before the Getty made its 1985 purchase.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="38"> Thomas Hoving, former director of the Met, editor of Connoisseur magazine and a frequent critic of the Getty, charged that the statue was a fake at the time of the Getty's purchase.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="39"> He based his argument on the opinion of Giuseppe Cellini, a Roman conservator, who thought the "Kouros" was an entirely different statue from the one the Getty actually bought.</s>

<s docid="LA070790-0098" num="40"> Subsequently, other scholars have expressed doubts about the piece, but "the weight of opinion was in favor of authenticity," Walsh said.</s>
