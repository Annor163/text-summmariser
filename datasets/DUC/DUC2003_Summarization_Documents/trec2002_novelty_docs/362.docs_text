<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="8"> A raid by federal agents on a South-Central Los Angeles "drop house" led to the arrests of four principals in a major smuggling operation suspected of transporting hundreds of illegal aliens by air to New York, Chicago and Miami in recent weeks, immigration officials said Wednesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="9"> Describing the ring as "one of the nation's largest and most sophisticated alien smuggling operations," Immigration and Naturalization Service Western Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell said he expected that the Tuesday raid -- which also netted 21 illegal aliens -- would soon be followed by the arrests of other "key principals" of the group in New York.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="10"> INS officials said there was accumulating evidence that the ring broken up Tuesday had worked in concert with other transcontinental smuggling operations, suggesting that the methods employed by "coyotes" who shuttle illegal workers on commercial flights are more sophisticated than initially believed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="11"> "Every smuggler we've picked up (in the last two weeks) had some connection with this organization," said INS Los Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="12"> Before Tuesday's raid, INS agents had arrested eight other suspected smugglers since the first widespread arrests of immigrants began in late February at Los Angeles International Airport and air terminals in Atlanta and New York.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="13"> Records seized during recent arrests and interviews with detained illegal aliens indicate that smugglers from several independent rings have been working together to link up with immigrant clients, Gustafson said.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="14"> Documents found Tuesday showed that the South-Central smuggling ring brought in more than $500,000 in recent weeks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="15"> "These groups are sharing referrals, money and specialties," Gustafson said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="16"> Immigration officials estimated that before the recent wave of arrests, the smuggling ring had flown "several hundred" aliens to destinations on the East Coast and in the Midwest.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="17"> Among them were large groups of immigrants from the Dominican Republic and Brazil -- countries that had not been previously considered major "sending areas" of undocumented aliens to the United States.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="18"> INS spokesman Ron Rogers said that the South-Central group was responsible for transporting "a majority" of the 79 illegal aliens who were arrested Feb. 27 at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to New York, the first of what has proven to be a series of large-scale arrests on airplanes and in drop houses.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="19"> Agents from the INS' so-called "Coyote Busters," a newly formed task force aimed at smugglers of undocumented workers, began surveillance three days ago on the one-story stucco drop house in the 500 block of West 85th Street after receiving information from several of the immigrants arrested in Atlanta that it had been used to temporarily house them, Rogers said.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="20"> Surrounded the House</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="21"> At about 7 p.m. Tuesday night, INS agents surrounded the three-room house.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="22"> In the kitchen, they found eight illegal aliens hemmed in around a stove, frying potatoes.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="23"> The others were wedged into a tiny bedroom.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="24"> "You wouldn't leave an animal in those kind of unsanitary conditions," Ezell said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="25"> The INS commissioner, who joined other immigration officials on the raid, said that one elderly immigrant told authorities she was held in the drop house for 10 days.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="26"> The woman reported that after paying the smugglers, she rode buses north from Mexico City to Tijuana and then to the border.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="27"> After being led with others across the crossing point, Ezell said, her group was driven north from San Diego to Los Angeles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="28"> A fee schedule seized at the house listed the payments required from the immigrants for the services they required.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="29"> The fees ranged from $950 to $6,000.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="30"> "It all depended on what you needed," Rogers said.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="31"> "If they took care of everything, it could get pretty steep".</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="32"> Use 'Redeye' Flights</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="33"> Typically, Gustafson said, the smugglers would wait until the late night "redeye" flights to order their tickets because the prices were cheap and there were fewer security and airport administrative personnel to notice their large group of immigrant clients.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="34"> After the recent wave of arrests began, the smuggling operation tried to change its tactics.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="35"> Several telephone numbers taken from arrested immigrants in New York tipped off the agency that the smugglers were planning to fly aliens from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and then on to New York -- avoiding the closely watched Los Angeles-to-Atlanta-to-New York route.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="36"> The bolstered presence of INS agents at Los Angeles airports, Ezell said, has kept illegal aliens from leaving many of the 30 to 40 suspected drop houses in Southern California.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="37"> INS officials added that in addition to the Tuesday arrests, they have begun surveillance at a dozen other drop houses in preparation for similar raids.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="38"> The four men arrested and held on suspicion of smuggling were identified as Hector Gomez-Miranda, 23, of Guatemala; Martin Garcia-Saldana, 18, of Mexico; Orlando Navarete-Leones, 23, of El Salvador and Dubon Serrano, 21, also from El Salvador.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="39"> All were described as "middlemen" in the operation.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="40"> The 21 illegal aliens will be allowed to return voluntarily to Mexico or face a deportation hearing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="41"> INS officials also announced that four Mexican immigrants were arrested at Los Angeles International Airport Wednesday on their way to take a flight to Chicago.</s>

<s docid="LA030989-0111" num="42"> The arrests raised the total number of illegal aliens apprehended at Los Angeles-area airports to 439 since Feb. 28.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="8"> U.S. immigration officials continued their crackdown on transcontinental alien-smuggling schemes that use a "red-eye" flight that departs daily from Los Angeles International Airport, arresting 69 illegal immigrants Monday night as they tried to board a New York-bound jetliner.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="9"> Among those apprehended, officials said Tuesday, was a 42-year-old suspected smuggler, who authorities say may lead them to others involved in the sophisticated smuggling operations.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="10"> Earlier Monday, 79 illegals, also bound for New York, were arrested at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport when the flight the smugglers were using -- Eastern Airlines Flight 80 -- arrived there for refueling.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="11"> Authorities said the arrests resulted from tips in Atlanta and Los Angeles that coyotes, as the smugglers are commonly called, had been using that flight to ferry thousands of aliens across the country from Los Angeles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="12"> Despite the arrest of Jorge Guzman-Romero on smuggling charges, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Los Angeles conceded Tuesday that they were not making much progress in capturing the masterminds behind the smuggling aboard the Eastern flight.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="13"> "We're not as close as we'd like to be," said Thomas Gaines, the local head of the INS' anti-smuggling unit.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="14"> Gaines said he believes that the use of Flight 80 may involve many smugglers who are not working together.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="15"> "We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are utilizing a rather low air fare to move their aliens away from the border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="16"> Donald Looney, assistant director of the INS Los Angeles district, said alien smuggling aboard commercial jetliners is not new, noting that the practice has been occurring "as long as there's been airplanes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="17"> As in the Atlanta arrests, Eastern officials cooperated with the INS and the airline is not involved in the smuggling, Looney said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="18"> Gaines and Looney offered few details at a Los Angeles news conference about specifics of how the scheme worked, the location of safe houses used by the smugglers or when other arrests might be made, saying they do not want to jeopardize the investigation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="19"> However, based on interviews with the aliens captured at Los Angeles, INS officials concluded that the smugglers have set up a system that transports aliens from Mexico City to Tijuana and then across the border to San Diego.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="20"> There, a safe house was occasionally used for aliens waiting for the trip to Los Angeles and Eastern Flight 80.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="21"> The aliens captured at the Los Angeles airport said they paid smugglers an average of $800 for the trip to New York.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="22"> Some of the aliens captured in Atlanta said they had paid as much as $4,000 for a package deal, including air fare, meals, housing and a job in the United States.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="23"> Of those arrested, 54 were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador, four from Colombia and four from Guatemala.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="24"> The Mexicans were bused to the border at San Ysidro; the others were being held for probable deportation today.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="25"> An affidavit filed in support of Guzman-Romero's arrest said he accompanied three Mexicans all the way from Mexico City.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="26"> In one instance, Guzman-Romero went to a small village in central Mexico and recruited a woman for the trip, according to an affidavit by INS agent Anna Marie Morones.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="27"> Some aliens were told to pay more money once they arrived in New York and other cities in the Northeast.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="28"> One veteran INS investigator, who asked that his name not be used, said Monday night's apprehensions went smoothly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="29"> "After the arrests went down in Atlanta, it was easy enough for us to go the next night to LAX, figure out where Flight 80 was boarding and round the people up," the agent said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="30"> Gaines said 11 of the aliens were arrested as they waited at the gate for Flight 80.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0036" num="31"> The rest were rounded up as they tried to enter Terminal 6, where Eastern is located.</s>

<s docid="LA030289-0080" num="10"> With a knowing smile, a man who all too readily identified himself as Jose Luis Hernandez admitted that he had just boarded three "cousins" on Eastern Airlines Flight 80 bound for New York, via Atlanta.</s>

<s docid="LA030289-0080" num="16"> INS officials described Eastern's flight, which departs daily from LAX at 10:50 p.m., as an unwitting conduit in a massive transcontinental smuggling operation that apparently moved several thousand illegals out of Los Angeles in the last month alone.</s>

<s docid="LA030289-0080" num="17"> Some of the aliens arrested said they paid as much as $4,000 for a package deal -- transportation from home, housing, the Eastern plane ticket and a job in New York.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="10"> The sweeping arrests this week of suspected illegal immigrants in Atlanta and Los Angeles represent a stepped-up government effort to stem the growing incidence of alien-smuggling, federal officials said Tuesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="11"> Faced with countless smugglers, called coyotes, whose sophisticated operations charge thousands of dollars to transport people from Latin America to this country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is fighting back with a crack unit of 300 special agents called, "Coyote Busters".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="12"> The effort, which often includes agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and other federal agencies, is producing an unusual amount of agreement between the INS and its usually harsh critics among immigrant rights groups.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="15"> Cecilia Munoz, of the National Council of La Raza, observed: "Any effort to control the border should include the attempt to control individuals who exploit potential border-crossers".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="16"> Officially members of the anti-smuggling unit of INS, many of the agents work undercover in jobs such as drivers and guides.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="17"> They often risk their lives -- at times even operating "drop houses" or getting themselves sold to unscrupulous labor contractors, INS officials said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="18"> "Some of the stuff these agents do is hair-raising," said Bob O'Leary, senior special agent of the INS unit, which was formed in 1978.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="19"> It found its mission increasingly difficult as waves of Central Americans began pouring into this country in the 1980s.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="20"> And with passage of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegal immigrants find it more and more difficult to live and work underground without smugglers and their cohorts to provide them with fake documents.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="21"> "We're coming into a whole new generation" of smugglers and immigrants, said O'Leary.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="25"> Demonstrating the magnitude of the problem, agents in 1988 apprehended 13,200 smugglers and 28,108 smuggled immigrants, seizing 9,677 vehicles worth $27.7 million.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="26"> In 1988, 1,121 smugglers were convicted of felonies; 4,868 were convicted of misdemeanors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="27"> In two operations this week, the INS arrested 148 suspected illegal immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="28"> One suspected smuggler also was arrested.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="29"> Some of the immigrants said they paid as much as $4,000 to smugglers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="30"> While many immigrants pay high prices to enter the United States, the costs to others are even more dear.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="31"> Some die in locked boxcars or on desert marches, while others are held hostage because relatives do not pay up, INS officials say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="32"> "I personally have been involved in cases where aliens were robbed at gunpoint in a garage," said Ron Smith, an INS official at the Western Region headquarters in Laguna Niguel.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="33"> The two cities where arrests were made this week -- Atlanta and Los Angeles -- graphically show the nationwide range of smuggling rings.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="35"> "There is no limitation to the methods smugglers use," Smith said.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="37"> We've even had reports that they (have) used small submarines".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="38"> Officials said smugglers increasingly include drugs and semiautomatic weapons in their activities.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="39"> "They are diversifying," one official noted.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="40"> Federal officials said they face an increasing number of high-speed chases, which often endanger innocent bystanders.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="41"> INS officials said it is partly out of this concern that they are planning to build a controversial 14-foot, $2-million ditch along the border near San Diego.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="42"> The smugglers are not all from Latin America.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="43"> In fact, said one Justice Department official, "The most difficult and sophisticated group" is based in China, using Hong Kong as a staging area.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="44"> "Their network extends worldwide".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="45"> At the same time, the smugglers are specializing more than before, said INS officials.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="46"> In the past, one network would recruit immigrants, select a staging area, guide and deliver the immigrants across the U.S. border.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="47"> "As of late," said one official, "many smugglers have become so specialized that they perform only one of these functions".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="48"> Training Coyote Busters is specialized as well.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="49"> Agents compete to be accepted in the unit, and then are sent to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., for three weeks of intensive training.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="50"> They learn how to identify smugglers, penetrate organizations and recruit informants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="51"> The 300 agents are based around the nation, with heavy concentrations in California, Texas, New York and Chicago, favorite destinations for illegal immigrants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="52"> The unit boasts that while it represents only 4% of the total INS force, it accounts for 36% of the felony convictions and 37% of the agency's conspiracy convictions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="53"> Among its recent successes, the unit cites Operation Boxcar, a four-month effort that netted 3,200 Latin American immigrants and 87 suspected smugglers in locked railroad cars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="54"> Operation Shorty involved an international organization smuggling Guatemalan Indians to farm labor contractors throughout the United States, where they lived in "utterly squalid conditions," INS documents report.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="55"> After a yearlong investigation using undercover drivers, labor contractors and agents posing as immigrants, a federal task force arrested 110 suspected smugglers and 5,000 immigrants, who were returned to Guatemala.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="56"> Despite these victories, federal officials acknowledge that the war against smuggling is far from over.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="57"> Many federal officials liken their struggle to the drug war, with more and more people getting into the mix.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="58"> Is the federal government winning or losing?</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0037" num="59"> One Justice Department official said that, like those waging the war on illegal drugs, "Even if you don't feel like you're winning, you have to keep fighting".</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="10"> In the midst of negotiations aimed at clarifying when police can turn illegal immigrants over to federal authorities, Los Angeles police officers Thursday called in the Immigration and Naturalization Service after rescuing 20 aliens from smugglers who were holding them hostage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="11"> Police were alerted to the situation by a frantic call from a man in Reno who reported that his wife and children were being held by alien smugglers in Los Angeles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="12"> Officers found the woman, her 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, along with 17 other suspected illegal Mexican immigrants, inside a "locked and barred, run-down sweatbox of a house" in the 4800 block of South McKinley Avenue.</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="13"> The smugglers were apparently holding the aliens for ransom, according to Police Chief Daryl F. Gates.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="14"> After police apprehended the suspected smugglers and rescued their hostages, they turned the entire group over to the INS, which began deportation proceedings against the hostages.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="15"> City Councilman Michael Woo said Thursday that the Police Department "has gone too far in trying to enforce the job of the INS".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="16"> Woo has led an effort in recent months to strengthen a longstanding LAPD policy that already bans police from turning aliens over to immigration authorities without cause.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="17"> "It seems that Chief Gates is not distinguishing between criminals, victims and witnesses," he added.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="18"> Woo predicted that Thursday's police action -- similar to one that occurred last month when 27 aliens were turned over to the INS -- would send "shock waves out to immigrants that they should be afraid of contacting police even if they are merely victims or witnesses to crime".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="19"> Gates defended his officers' action in a press release, saying that the LAPD "makes absolutely no effort to seek out undocumented (aliens).</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="20">. . . Of our own accord, we do not initiate action against anyone merely because of their immigration status" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="21"> He added, however, that "when we are confronted by serious criminal actions. . . we cannot look the other way" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="22"> Gates said that the handling of the hostage case is in keeping with the department's 1979 policy to not go after immigrants merely because of their illegal status.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="23"> How well the department is adhering to this policy, however, has been the focus of a growing controversy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="24"> Earlier this week, immigrant advocates testified at a City Council committee hearing that police increasingly have turned over to the INS victims and witnesses of crimes, who then are almost certain to be deported.</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="25"> And, they testified, this policy is stirring a growing mistrust of police on the part of immigrant communities.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="26"> "We definitely do not want to interfere with the ability of the police to do their job," said City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who chaired the hearing held earlier this week before the city's Public Safety Committee.</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="27"> "However, it is cases like this that point to the need to clarify just what the policy is".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="28"> INS officials, meanwhile, maintained police "did the right thing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="29"> "We encourage cooperation between the INS and local law enforcement agencies," said INS District Director Robert Moschorak.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="30"> Later in the day, INS agents apprehended an additional 36 suspected illegal aliens and two smugglers at the same Los Angeles address as the smugglers pulled up to the house with another van filled with people.</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="31"> These suspects were immediately taken into INS custody.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="32"> Moschorak said his office had begun the process of filing criminal charges against five suspected smugglers and deportation proceedings against the 20 aliens who were held hostage -- including the woman and her two children who sparked the investigation -- as well as the 36 apprehended later.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="33"> Some may voluntarily leave the country.</s>

<s docid="LA072090-0019" num="34"> A few will be asked to temporarily remain in the country as material witnesses against the smugglers, Moschorak said.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="18"> [Text] When a delegation of senior State Department and immigration officials arrives in Beijing tomorrow, their meeting with Chinese counterparts will not be taking place under the best of circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="19"> The United States had hoped to be doing nothing more painful than smoothing over minor disputes with the Chinese on how to combat alien smuggling, and on arrangements for sending more of the sorry boatloads back home.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="20"> But the talks will now be taking place in the shadow of the mysterious ship which dropped off more than 100 Fujianese at the Virginia coast last month and disappeared into the night, embarrassing authorities who had congratulated themselves that last year's alien smuggling crisis was over.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="21"> Intelligence reports indicate that other boats may be at sea bearing human cargoes whose eventual destination is the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="22"> It is clear last year's high-profile defeats for the smugglers -- most notably the Golden Venture and East Wood incidents -- plus China's reported crackdown on activities on home soil have put only temporary hurdles in the smugglers' path.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="23"> Quite apart from last week's raids in Maryland and New York, which revealed the safe passage of the latest boat, the SUNDAY MORNING POST has learned smuggling activities are still rampant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="24"> More than 100 illegal Chinese immigrants have been rounded up by border patrol officers in Puerto Rico this year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="25"> All had taken a one-day boat journey from the nearby Dominican Republic after tortuous round-the world routes via Hong Kong, Europe and South America.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="26"> The island has become the latest target of the smuggling gangs because of its easy access by sea, its less heavily-patrolled waters, and the fact that it comes under U.S. jurisdiction, meaning the immigrants can fly on to the U.S. mainland without needing documents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="27"> "It's a very nice way of coming in the back door," one immigration intelligence official said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="28"> Last week, 38 Chinese, mostly Fujianese, were discovered on a beach in early morning -- presumably waiting for their guide to turn up.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="29"> They told investigators they had flown from Hong Kong either to London or Paris, then on to the Dominican Republic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="30"> There they waited several weeks before taking a small boat for the short trip to Puerto Rico.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="31"> Another group discovered in January said they had spent many weeks passing through Brazil and Bolivia before reaching the Dominican Republic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="32"> Investigators believed smugglers began using the new entry point after the failure of huge shiploads to make it safely to the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="33"> However, the authorities believe that for every person caught, scores may be passing through undetected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="34"> Investigators are finding that the aliens probably left China with valid exit documents, but acquired fake visas to enter transit countries in Europe and South America.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="35"> One immigration official said the authorities had been caught unawares by the audacity of the smugglers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="36"> "From my perspective, there has been a false sense of security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="37"> I think we may have let our guard down," the official said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="38"> "The feeling was, we had some successes like the East Wood (intercepted last year off the Marshall Islands), and the Golden Venture, which was terrible publicity for the smugglers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="39"> But the series of victories was more luck than anything else.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="40"> The smugglers have since changed their tactics, using smaller loads and different routes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="41"> He said that tough legislation, promised last year by President Bill Clinton, had "lost its momentum".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="42"> Although the record on catching smugglers has been reasonable, the punishments inflicted are not great.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="43"> For instance, the captain and crew of the Golden Venture have been allowed to plead guilty to minor alien smuggling charges, and may escape with a few months in prison.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="44"> Likewise, many of the 15 or so alleged members of the New York- based Fuk Ching gang said to be behind the transporting and kidnapping of last year's boatloads -- are negotiating guilty plea bargains with prosecutors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="45"> A recent Justice Department memorandum confirms the administration has partly retreated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="46"> In it, Assistant Attorney-General Sheila Anthony suggests tagging certain provisions, such as increased penalties for alien smuggling, to existing bills rather than putting forward a controversial new set of laws.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="47"> Streamlining of the asylum process is occurring without the need for new legislation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="48"> The problem is being attacked only after the illegal immigrants have been smuggled in.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="49"> Gangs appear unconcerned by plans to deny work permits to asylum seekers for longer periods, or to charge applicants a processing fee.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="50"> The immigration official said the alien smugglers worked under such a "complex web" of contacts and alliances that the only way to beat them was to put resources into intelligence work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="51"> "I do think we will see more boats this summer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="52"> They've had time to regroup," he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="53"> "But patrolling the shores is only really a last resort.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="54"> The key is criminal intelligence, getting informants and penetrating the gangs".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="55"> Last week's raids on the safe houses came after a relative of one illegal immigrant tipped off the FBI that the group was being held hostage and threatened for the US$30,000 (HK$232,000) smuggling fee.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2353" num="56"> Without the call, the aliens would eventually have melted seamlessly into the shadowy underworld that contained millions of illegal workers like them.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111989-0088" num="56"> In recent years, the volume and sophistication of Chinese smuggling has increased dramatically with the social disruption caused by the wars in the Indochinese peninsula, the opening of China, the uncertainty over the futures of Hong Kong and Taiwan and the "economic seesaw" that periodically affects Chinese populations, the memorandum said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111989-0088" num="57"> "Indeed, the syndicates smuggling ethnic Chinese have now forged links with other ethnic groups involved in drug trafficking, criminal activities and racketeering enterprises producing substantial illicit proceeds," Bruce Nicholl, INS senior agent in Washington, said in the memorandum.</s>

<s docid="LA111989-0088" num="59"> Typically, Nicholl said, an immigrant must work off his debt in a restaurant or other legitimate business at below-minimum wage.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111989-0088" num="69"> Unlike Latino smuggling rings, which are easier to infiltrate, the Chinese syndicates have a closed nature that makes them virtually impossible to penetrate, U.S. officials say.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="16"> Cheng-jung (6753 2052 2837): Fujian Checks Tendency of Smuggling Out Illegal Emigrants"] [Text] Fuzhou, 18 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--In the latter half of last year, due to the infiltration of international human smuggling rings, activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants were rampant along the coastal areas of Fuzhou.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="17"> In order to reap huge profits, "snakeheads" [leaders of the smuggling gangs] were careless of the lives of the illegal emigrants and consequently, eight illegal migrants died in a "strange land" when the freighter Golden Venture ran aground on the U.S. East Coast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="18"> The central authorities and the provincial and city governments were shocked by this incident and it was not until then that the special anti-illegal emigration operation, which had been secretly launched for a long time, was made public.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="19"> A few days ago, this reporter visited Fuzhou City, one of the areas where smuggling activities of illegal emigrants are most severe and learned that the operation had achieved remarkable results in the past six months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="20"> According to statistics, the authorities cracked 53 cases of smuggling out illegal emigrants, seized 932 people, and ferreted out 205 "snakeheads" who organized and plotted activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants inside and outside the territory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="21"> Of these, 127 "snakeheads" were arrested and brought to justice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="22"> Meanwhile, 163 criminals organizing smuggling activities and conveying illegal emigrants were seized and 14 smuggling ships were confiscated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="23"> Officials of Fuzhou City said that activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants have basically stopped.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="24"> All-Out Interception and Key Spots on Guard</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="25"> It was learned that measures taken by Fuzhou City in its special operation of fighting against illegal emigration were mainly as follows: "Spreading propaganda among the masses, educating them, and fighting against major cases," "calling on the masses to inform against smuggling cases and assigning public security personnel to investigate and punish those cases," "pursuing smugglers at sea and intercepting them on land," and "guarding key spots and imposing full control".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="26"> Apart from integrating these measures into a single whole, decisions concerning the number of personnel, time, tasks, and responsibilities were all fixed and implemented at every level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="27"> Likewise, precautionary measures were taken at every level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="28"> Border defense and public security personnel being on guard at ports strengthened shipping administration at ports, bays, and ferries; supervised fixed spots, ships, posts, and locations at 396 ports and bays; and ordered various types of 17,672 ships to register with the authorities again and receive new codes and permits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="29"> Meanwhile, since it had become a characteristic that most illegal emigrants did not board smuggling ships at localities in which their permanent residences were registered, the authorities imposed greater control over inns and hotels in various localities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="30"> Stations were set up in public places and localities with a large number of floating population for nonnative people to report to and the authorities attached importance to the work of ferreting out suspects involved in activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="31"> Contingent forces were specially organized to deal with emergent cases of smuggling illegal emigrants.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="32"> Line of Defense Against Illegal Emigration Set on the Sea</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="33"> Departments of border defense and public security redeployed forces for patrol and inspection at sea and transferred 12 ships and boats to strengthen patrols at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="34"> A line of defense against illegal emigration was established on the maritime space from Luoyuan Wan in the north to Pingyun in the south.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="35"> In key villages along the coast, concerned departments strengthened education and imposed stricter control on three kinds of people, that is: People within the key age groups for illegal emigration, people with past records of illegal emigration, and people suspected of taking part in activities of smuggling out illegal emigrants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="36"> Moreover, rules and regulations were set up in every native village which was considered a unit, to implement the village-cadre contract responsibility system, to intensify the registration of foreign population, and to vigorously plug the loopholes which key target groups of people were beyond control.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="38"> Moreover, people organizing illegal emigration and conveying illegal emigrants were severely punished by judicial departments in Fuzhou City in accordance with the law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="39"> On 15 July 1993, the first rally to pronounce judgments on criminals since the start of the anti-illegal emigration struggle was held by Fuzhou City Intermediate Court in Fuzhou City Workers' Cultural Palace.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="40"> On the basis of the law, the court sentenced 32 criminals smuggling illegal emigrants to one to five years' imprisonment, announced the arrests of 15 other criminals for smuggling illegal emigrants, and sent 44 illegal emigrants to reeducation-through-labor camps.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="41"> Among them, Chen Xingnuan and Wu Baohua--two criminals from Changle County--introduced a total of 17 persons to a "snakehead" called Zhang to join him in smuggling activities organized by him.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="42"> On 5 January 1993, 17 illegal emigrants organized by Chen and Wu boarded a ship in Taishan, Guangdong, to emigrate to the United States, but they were later repatriated to China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="43"> The two criminals--Chen and Wu--violated state laws and regulations on immigration and emigration constituting the crime of organizing others to slip out of the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="44"> Consequently, Chen Xingnuan was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined 30,000 yuan; whereas Wu Baohua was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined 10,000 yuan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="45"> It is learned that over the past six months, political and legal organs at all levels throughout the city have punished a total of 208 criminals organizing and plotting activities of illegal emigration and conveying illegal emigrants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="46"> Of these, 15 were imprisoned, 18 were sent to reeducation-through-labor camps, 100 were detained and tried, 33 were fined, and seven were under house arrest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="47"> In addition, permission was sought from public security organs at higher levels to ask Interpol to help pursue six plotters in large foreign smuggling rings who were at large.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="48"> Meanwhile, strict precautions were taken to deal with the new situation of illegal emigration from other places which started to emerge not long ago.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="49"> Over the past four months, 10 such cases of illegal emigration to the United States and Japan have been cracked and a total of 422 people arrested.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26112" num="50"> Moreover, 11 cases of illegal emigration in which Taiwanese freighters were directly involved have been cracked.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-2234" num="15"> Article Type:BFN [Text] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--Criminals responsible for organising illegal emigration from China face severe punishment, including the death penalty, under a tough new law passed last week, the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] said Sunday [6 March].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-2234" num="16"> The law, passed at a National People's Congress standing committee session Saturday [5 March], warns that "snake heads," or criminals who are behind illegal immigration rackets, will face jail terms of between seven years and life for their involvement in illegal emigration schemes, the report said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-2234" num="17"> Those guilty of the murder, injury, rape or sale of illegal emigrants or of the murder or injury of border inspectors may be sentenced to death, the new law states.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-2234" num="18"> Previously, the maximum penalty for organising illegal emigration was five years imprisonment, but a surge last year in the numbers of Chinese paying snake heads up to 30,000 dollars to be smuggled abroad on decrepit ships has forced the authorities to stiffen punishment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-2234" num="19"> In the most spectacular case, six illegal immigrants died when almost 300 of them tried to swim and wade ashore after their ship, the Golden Venture, ran aground in New York City in June.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="7"> Two trawlers, each carrying a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants packed into the holds, were seized earlier this week as they landed at fishing harbours near Monterey and San Francisco.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="8"> The coastal vessels are believed to have picked up their passengers five days earlier from off-shore 'mother ships' which crossed the Pacific.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="9"> Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into the US, the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused city pier.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="17"> Although they come to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the immigrants instead become slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime to pay off their debts, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="23"> The recent influx has raised suspicions in the US of complicity by the Chinese government in the human trafficking.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="24"> But in Beijing officials deny 'turning a blind eye' to illegal emigration.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="25"> 'The Chinese government has all along been opposed to illegal emigration and has adopted a series of measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="26"> Mr Wu insisted that Chinese security organisations had 'intensified their efforts' to stop illegal organisations trafficking in immigrants.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="27"> However, some of the immigrants landing in San Francisco this week spoke of paying additional fees to bribe Chinese government officials to let them leave the country, according to US investigators.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="29"> So far this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese immigrants, more than twice the number in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="30"> The rising numbers could, however, reflect a change of route, rather than a growing volume of illegal immigrants.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="31"> US investigators speculate that the smugglers are now cutting out 'middle men' in other countries and attempting to maximise their profits by landing their passengers directly on US shores.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="32"> Chinese officials charge that the willingness of some countries (including the US) to grant 'political asylum' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging human smuggling.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4965" num="33"> Indeed, US immigration lawyers representing some of the passengers of the Pai Sheng say that they will seek asylum and note that the judicial process may take as long as 10 years, giving their clients time to seek legal US residency.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="7"> AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freighter, believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran aground close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="8"> The grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after 2am yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="9"> More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly waters, and swam about half a mile to the shore.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="10"> According to emergency rescue workers, who reached the scene shortly afterwards, four passengers were known to have died on the beach, and another two in hospital later.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="11"> Two bodies were also washed ashore.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="12"> By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted for about 300 people.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="13"> Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering from exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="14"> There were also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the vessel.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="15"> Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's interior suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="16"> However, officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who had been aboard the ship.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="17"> Interpreters who were called to the scene said that some passengers claimed to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100 days.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="18"> They also reported that it made a number of stops in China before crossing the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="19"> This fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian 'human smuggling' ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000 for the journey.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="20"> Mr William Slattery, New York district director for immigration and naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese from Fukien province.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="21"> The 11 crew members were still being questioned by the US authorities last night, while their passengers were placed in the custody of the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="22"> All are understood to have asked for political asylum.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="23"> The vessel itself remained stranded on a sand-bank.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="24"> However, the local Coast Guard reported that it was up against a 'rock jetty', and expressed concern that an oil spill might develop.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="25"> The ship was carrying about five tons of diesel fuel.</s>

<s docid="FT932-4966" num="26"> Illegal Chinese immigration has been on the rise in New York City, but this is believed to be the first time a vessel carrying such a large number of passengers has disgorged its load on the city's shoreline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-52620" num="19"> A 46-year-old Indonesian man who claimed to be the captain was quoted as saying the ship left Guangzhou in the Chinese southeastern province of Guangdong on April 19 with 13 crew members and 81 passengers, including six women, they said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-52620" num="20"> The man told investigators the freighter was caught in net Wednesday and sent about 30 passengers, including the women, to shore by a small boat early Thursday morning, police said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-52620" num="21"> A 22-year-old detained passenger reportedly said he was bound for Tokyo and paid 60,000 yuan (about 750,000 yen) as a guarantee for smuggling into Japan and was to pay another 110,000 yuan (about 1.38 million yen) if the attempt succeeded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-5746" num="15"> Police caught the Chinese group in a sweep after they landed in Susami aboard several small boats early Thursday and tried to make their way to Osaka and Nagoya in 13 cars rented by the others, they said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-5746" num="17"> The 91 illegal immigrants, including 12 women, reportedly told police that some of them had come from China while others came from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</s>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="9"> The three men, all Mexican citizens, were arrested after an illegal immigrant who had just had his head shaved flagged down a passing police car and led the officers to the house where it happened, said police spokesman Bill Robinson.</s>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="12"> Police said they believe Thursday's incident is tied to a string of seven similar assaults where undocumented immigrants have reported being taken to a house somewhere in San Diego, being robbed, having their heads shaved and then having their trousers ripped apart.</s>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="13"> "It's to humiliate them so that any smuggler who sees them says, 'I'm not going to transport this guy, he doesn't pay,' " said Sgt.</s>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="15"> "The word's out on the street that if you see a guy with a shaved head, he made an arrangement with a smuggler to smuggle him and then wouldn't pay".</s>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="18"> Carloads of illegal immigrants are smuggled across the border, he said, and taken to the house, where financial arrangements are made to farm them out to other smugglers who can take them north.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="19"> But those who have no money, instead of simply being put out to make their own way, are "marked" by the head shaving and ripped trousers.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="23"> Police say they were able to make the arrests Thursday because 20-year-old Javier Garcia Robles of Juarez, Mexico, came running out of a house at 42nd and Market streets with his head shaved and flagged down officers Jack Knish and Kurt Grube, who were patrolling in their police cruiser.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA092190-0034" num="24"> The men in the house had tried to take money from Robles but when they found out he didn't have any, they shaved his head, cut off his trouser legs and were getting ready to dump him somewhere in San Diego when he managed to escape, Palmer said.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="17"> There were women in there and one elderly gentleman over 70 years old," Gregg said.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="28"> Most of the aliens will be returned to their country after questioning, Gregg said, although some will be retained as material witnesses.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="29"> "Alien smugglings are not uncommon.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="30"> The fact that you have a large number of people crammed into such a tiny space makes this case unusual," Gregg said.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="31"> "That's an extremely dangerous situation for those people.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="32"> They could have been abandoned by the smuggler or great injury, even death, could have resulted from the poor ventilation".</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="33"> Gregg said the compartment's construction and the type of truck used indicate the smuggling might be a part of a professional operation.</s>

<s docid="LA072790-0156" num="34"> The aliens most probably had been picked up near the border, although the exact location has not been pinpointed yet, he said.</s>
