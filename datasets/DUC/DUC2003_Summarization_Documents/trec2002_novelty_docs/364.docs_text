<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="9"> An animal-welfare activist this week set the first traps in his campaign to remove the cats that for decades have lived in the beachfront rocks along the promenade outside Ventura's Holiday Inn.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="10"> Leo Grillo, who runs a private cat shelter in the high desert near Acton, received an endorsement of the move from the state Parks and Recreation Department, which controls San Buenaventura State Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="11"> Grillo said the two dozen cats there -- remnants of a colony that at one time numbered about 100 -- are sick or dying.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="12"> But both he and state officials believe the trapping will face severe opposition from several quarters.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="13"> Animal lovers have long enjoyed watching the cats scamper along the rocks, and a small but devoted corps of volunteers has fed them daily.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="14"> Previous attempts to interfere with what has become something of a Ventura institution have met with resistance.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="15"> "We've had reports of assaults on people trying to work out this problem," said Steve Treanor, Ventura district superintendent for the state Parks and Recreation Department, adding that an elderly woman once pelted him with cat food when she mistakenly thought he was trying to run down a cat on his bicycle.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="16"> Joyce George, president of the Humane Society of Ventura County, cited "a very militant group" that has blocked trapping efforts.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="17"> "We've had officers whose lives were threatened," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="18"> "There have been so many agencies involved.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="19"> Nobody really wants to get into it with these people".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="20"> Grillo said onlookers hurled rocks at him and sabotaged his traps when he tried to organize a similar rescue a few years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="21"> But what he described as the cats' deteriorating health makes the move necessary, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="22"> Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Department of Animal Regulation, agrees that the cats should go.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="23"> She said her department, which is under contract with the city of Ventura, has not dealt extensively with the cats since city officials issued orders in 1981 to steer clear of them.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="24"> However, she said, they constitute a public health menace in the making.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="25"> Each year, rabid bats are found at the nearby Ventura County fairgrounds and along the Ventura River, and "it's just a matter of time," she said, before the cat colony is infected.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="26"> Many of the cats have upper-respiratory infections, she added, and a couple have died painfully after warming themselves on cold nights under the hoods of cars in a nearby parking garage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="27"> For such reasons, state parks officials provided Grillo with a letter that he had requested, approving the move.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="28"> "It's not good to have the cats out there," Treanor said.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="29"> "Those cats have a very low quality of life.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="30"> They spread diseases among themselves.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="31"> And when they die, they die in the rocks, creating a health hazard.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="32"> It's an artificially created situation, and we try to manage for the most natural conditions".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="33"> By most accounts, cats have been abandoned on the beachfront rocks for as long as 25 years.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="34"> Food and water would be set out for them by well-intentioned cat lovers, who inadvertently encouraged others to abandon cats in a place where they would receive some care, animal control officials said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="35"> By 1980, the colony had grown so large that the city planned to trap the cats and turn them over to the Humane Society.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="36"> The plan was scrapped in the wake of a public outcry.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="37"> The Humane Society was allowed to trap some cats and spay or neuter them and return them to the rocks.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="38"> Society officials say a few had to be killed.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="39"> The city's policy since has been to let the cats alone, except when a health threat is apparent, said Carol Green, assistant to the city manager.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="40"> Just how apparent it is now might be a subject for debate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="41"> "They ain't sick," said 90-year-old Florence Cardone, a stooped but feisty figure in a red hat who has hauled canned food to the cats on a metal cart almost every morning since 1976.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="42"> "They live out their lives here pretty well".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="43"> Also skeptical is Ralph Weigel, one of the 1980 plan's most vocal opponents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="44"> "I'm highly suspicious," said Weigel, who quit the Humane Society's board of directors to protest the 1980 trapping.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="45"> "There must be so many cats closer to them that need attention.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="46"> Why are they coming up here"?</s>
</P>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="48"> "The cats are there of their own free will," he added.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="49"> "They're not tied, they're not fenced.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="50"> They can live very safely in those rocks, as long as they have food and water".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="51"> Weigel said he believes the cats are healthy.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="52"> But he said he could support Grillo's plan if it is proven to him that the cats are ill.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="53"> "The time is coming when, in spite of anything you do, they're going to get those cats out of there," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="54"> Angelo Borghi, another leader in the fight to keep the cats, said the animals are no more sickly than any population of house cats would be.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="55"> He said a veterinarian, whom he would not identify, has checked them out and found only minor problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="56"> "I don't know why this crap comes up every few years," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="57"> "This guy has no business up here.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="58"> Is he a vivisectionist or what"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="59"> Borghi warned that hundreds of cats would be deliberately abandoned on the beach if the trapping persists.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="60"> On Monday, Grillo set out five traps baited with antibiotic-laced cat food but failed to catch any cats.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="61"> He hopes to devise a system using traps and nets and to round up half a dozen Ventura volunteers.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="62"> The volunteers would not only help in the trapping of the timid animals, which is expected to last a month, but would also monitor the rocks afterward for additional strays.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="63"> "I'm offering an ideal solution," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="64"> "They will live happily ever after".</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="65"> Kills No Animals</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="66"> A former actor, Grillo runs three shelters for about 400 dogs and 200 cats under the auspices of DELTA (Dedication and Everlasting Love to Animals), a nonprofit group he founded in 1979.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="67"> The animals are all pets that have been abandoned and have adapted to living on their own.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="68"> Those that can't be given to families live out their lives in the shelters; Grillo kills no animals and even runs what amounts to a hospice for cats with terminal diseases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="69"> Grillo said the Ventura cats would occupy a room in a rural ranch house, complete with couches, air conditioning, fireplace, potbelly stove, studio and cathedral ceilings.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="70"> The 150 cats in the shelter roam at will from room to room, lounging on cat furniture and romping with cat toys in the house and in the house's fenced 3,000-square-foot yard.</s>

<s docid="LA081789-0055" num="71"> Grillo said he eventually would like to build a wing for beach cats and have the sounds of surf piped in to comfort them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="16"> [Text] A dramatic increase in rabies cases last year is causing concern at the National Veterinary Service, which reported 70 cases in 1993, the highest number since 1957.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="17"> There were only 46 reported cases in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="18"> "The increase -- which is very worrying -- is because of the rising incidents among foxes and jackals," said Chief Veterinarian Avner Shimshoni.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="19"> "It shows that without efforts to reduce the jackal and fox population there is no way of stopping the spread of rabies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="20"> Just 15 of the reported rabies cases last year were in dogs; 43 were among foxes and jackals and the rest in other animals including one sheep, an ass, a cat, and cattle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="21"> In 1992, 23 rabies cases were dogs and 13 were foxes and jackals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="22"> During 1993, 117,129 dogs were vaccinated against rabies -- an increase of 10 percent over the previous year -- but a quarter of the dog population remains without anti-rabies inoculation, Shimshoni noted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="23"> The rise in the numbers of dog owners vaccinating their pets is partly a response to the drop in license and vaccine fees in some towns.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22643" num="24"> New regulations in force at the end of 1993 put a maximum price dog license at NIS [new Israeli shekels] 37.5 and NIS 13.5 for the vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="14"> Malaria, yaws, yellow fever, hemorrhagic fever, dengue, typhus, bubonic plague, and leishmaniasis cast shadows over 75 percent of Bolivia's territory and constitute a public health problem because of their magnitude.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="16"> The population of the area affected by malaria, the tropical disease caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, is 2.7 million, and there has been an increase recently in the number afflicted due principally to a halt in fumigation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="17"> There were 25,364 cases reported in 1989, 19,031 in 1991, 24,486 in 1992, and 12,000 in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="18"> The risk of contracting malaria is greatest in the district of Guayaramerin, where the incidence is 215 cases per 1,000 inhabitants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="19"> Here 42 percent of the known cases are due to the presence in that area of an ideal center of larval incubation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="21"> The endemic zone in that department is located in Hernando Siles and Luis Calvo Provinces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="22"> The incidence of cases in Cochabamba is three per 1,000, in La Paz four per 1,000, and in Santa Cruz seven per 1,000.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="27"> There are two determining causes of the disease of yaws: the presence of the transmitting vector, which determines the endemic area, and the severe poverty in which the populace lives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="28"> This is an area which covers six departments and 25 provinces where more than a million persons live.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="29"> A program has been started to improve the precarious dwellings of mud and adobe, typical of the area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="30"> In the cracks of these huts the bugs are able to hide and find shelter from insecticides.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="31"> According to estimates of the National Secretariat of Health, there are 562,000 dwellings where bugs are almost always present, and 90 percent of these bugs carry the microorganism that causes the disease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="32"> Human and Canine Rabies</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="33"> Official figures indicate that there were only 32 cases of canine rabies during the first two months of 1994, while during the same period of 1993 there were 131 cases of canine rabies, four in felines, one in sheep, and three cases of human rabies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="34"> There is one dog for every 10 persons in Bolivia; there are 700,000 of these animals, considered by man to be one of his best friends.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="37"> Its presence is slight but lethal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="38"> Several years ago, Bolivia pledged to eradicate rabies completely from its nine major cities by 1990, a commitment that was not met due to the impossibility of obtaining the vaccine or the funds to acquire it .</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="39"> Hemorrhagic Fever</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="40"> This disease, which causes the patient's death in a few hours due to massive hemorrhaging of the conjunctive tissues and of the oral mucous membranes, profuse nasal hemorrhaging, and even hemorrhaging through the skin, first appeared in 1959.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="41"> The endemic area is entirely within the department of Pando.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="42"> The pathogenic agent is the Machupo virus, carried by the callomis callosus rat.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="43"> Until 1975, sporadic outbreaks occurred that were characterized by a high degree of mortality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="44"> No cases were reported between 1976 and 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="45"> Recently, a reported new outbreak of five cases sounded the alarm for the population of Pando, but so far the analyses do not show that this dangerous disease is involved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="46"> The disease is endemic in areas bordering the Machupo and Negro Rivers, and in areas adjacent to the settlements of San Ramon and San Joaquin, where an ecological imbalance has occurred due to excessive hunting of felines, which has permitted the rodents to multiply.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="47"> Leishmaniasis, 1 Million Persons Within Its Reach</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="49"> Almost a million persons run the risk of contracting this illness, a deforming disease similar to leprosy that destroys the sufferer's face.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="50"> The disease is caused by the bite of a mosquito, a blood-sucker of limited flying range that lives in tree tops in mountainous areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="51"> The disease manifests itself in deformities of the nasal and oral mucous membranes and of the ear lobe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="52"> The bite causes a characteristic spot with an ulceration that often heals by itself, or else continues to ulcerate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33007" num="53"> This is the first symptom of leishmaniasis, and its timely detection can help to avoid deformities.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="32"> In 1992, the number rose to 782 people, and in the first eight months of this year, 557 people have received rabies vaccinations after being bitten by a dog.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="33"> What is worrisome is that Laos has always used a vaccine produced from animal brain tissue.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="34"> This vaccine is similar to that produced by the Saowapha Institute and the Government Pharmaceutical Organization here in Thailand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="35"> Laos does not produce this vaccine itself.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="36"> It was obtained from the Soviet Union, its old mentor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="37"> But now, its old mentor is collapsing and so Laos does not have any of this vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="38"> But there is a new vaccine that is produced from cell cultures that is sold at government drug stores.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="39"> And some people cross the river to Thailand to buy vaccine at drug stores in Nong Khai Province.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="40"> They pack it in bottles and take it back to Laos.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="41"> There is also a duck embryo vaccine produced by Switzerland.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="42"> I was told that patrol vehicles provide vaccination services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="43"> As for preventing and controlling this disease, the [Lao] Department of Livestock Development and Animal Husbandry, which is similar to our department, is responsible for handling things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="44"> It vaccinates dogs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="45"> But very few dogs are actually receiving rabies vaccinations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="46"> In 1988, a total of 2,800 dogs were vaccinated, in 1989, 2,300 were vaccinated, in 1990, 3,650 were vaccinated, in 1991, 4,520 were vaccinated, and in 1992, 7,230 were vaccinated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="47"> What Laos must do in order to prevent and control this disease is to conduct more studies on this disease and obtain anti-rabies vaccines for both people and animals so that there is always a supply on hand, particularly vaccine produced by cell cultures, which is rather expensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="48"> The rabies monitoring and reporting system must be improved, and the capabilities of the laboratories in the cities and provinces must be improved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="49"> The laws concerned must be implemented strictly, and an effort must be made to get neighboring countries (meaning Thailand) and international organizations to provide technical help in order to obtain the technical support and equipment needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="50"> At the seminar, I discussed the broad epidemiology situation regarding rabies in various countries in the world and described the symptoms of this disease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="51"> I told them about the various vaccines available and the recommendations made by the World Health Organization in giving vaccinations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="52"> I also told them about my own personal experiences, because I have been involved with this disease since 1962.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="53"> And I am still involved in this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="54"> As for hepatitis B, I told those at the seminar that there are several types of hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="55"> These are interesting, because they are encountered frequently, with the most common types being hepatitis A and B. I discussed the symptoms, secondary infections, and the treatment and prevention of this disease using vaccines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="56"> There are now vaccines to control both hepatitis A and B.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="57"> In Laos, few people are given vaccinations to prevent hepatitis B.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="58"> This is because doctors and other medical personnel do not have much knowledge about this disease, and the vaccine is still very expensive (one dose costs 9,000 kip).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="59"> I told them that Thailand is now inoculating about 1 million infants a year free of charge.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="60"> Dr. Somthana said that Laos will have to find a way to obtain help from international organizations in studying hepatitis B.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="61"> After I ended my talk on giving preventive vaccinations, many people asked me questions about this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="62"> Dr. Rattanapon, the head of one of the examination laboratories, was one of those who was very interested in this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="63"> He asked me to provide him with documents concerning the various strains of hepatitis, because Laos lacks such documents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22547" num="64"> I told him that we do not live very far away and that if he wants anything, all he has to do is ask and I will send it to him.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="6"> The Commons agriculture committee will today recommend a wholesale change in government policy on quarantine for pets, saying it should be replaced immediately with a cheaper system of vaccinations and blood-testing.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="7"> The proposed change, under which pets would require health 'passports', would apply to dogs and cats entering the UK from other European Union countries and countries free of rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="8"> The six-month quarantine would continue for pets from other destinations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="9"> The committee says: 'We consider that a system such as we propose would effectively decrease the likelihood (of rabies entering the UK) not least because the costs of the new procedure, a small fraction of the expense of quarantine, would no longer provide an incentive for many to smuggle their animals into this country'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="10"> The cost of quarantine for a 'sizeable dog' can vary between Pounds 600 and Pounds 1,500, the committee says.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="11"> The MPs are calling for compensation for owners of quarantine kennels wishing to leave the industry or convert their businesses.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="12"> But the British Veterinary Association yesterday opposed the immediate ending of quarantine, saying the EU should first be free of rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="13"> The MPs point out that the incidence of animal rabies in the EU has fallen sharply from 8,506 in 1989 to 1,207 last year, and that the European Commission believes it will be eradicated within two or three years.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="14"> The agriculture committee admits it may have difficulty persuading the government of its case.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="15"> 'Neither reform nor replacement of the quarantine system is under active consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture, which is adopting a position of Olympian detachment on the issue'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="16"> Under their proposed changes, modelled on measures adopted by Sweden in May, dogs and cats due to be imported into the UK from approved countries would be identified by a unique number carried in an implanted microchip or tattoo.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="17"> The animals would have to be vaccinated at the age of three months or above, undergo a blood test four months later to establish their immunity, and spend at least six months in the approved country before entering the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="18"> Pets would be allowed in for up to 12 months after the initial vaccination, with frequent travellers requiring annual boosters.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="19"> Vaccination records and other health certificates would be carried in a passport relating to the animal.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="20"> However, Mr Paul DeVile, president of the British Veterinary Association, said yesterday that tattooing was difficult and microchip technology insufficiently advanced, while standards of health certification differed across the EU.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="21"> The committee also considered health controls on imported farm animals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-7827" num="22"> It concluded that the European single market had not resulted in the 'disease time-bomb' some experts predicted.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="7"> For reasons no one can explain, it died out in Europe during the later part of the 19th and first half of the 20th century.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="8"> In 1939, though, there was an ominous outbreak close to the Polish-German frontier.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="9"> Since then - spread mainly by red foxes - the virus has travelled inexorably west across Europe at a rate of about 40 kilometres a year.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="10"> Rabies was eradicated from Britain by 1903, but with fox-borne rabies now only just across the English Channel, some scientists are convinced that it will soon be back.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="11"> In 1986, James Murray, professor of mathematical biology at Oxford University, published a computer model warning that rabies will return to Britain - and will spread rapidly.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="12"> Prof Murray points to the rarity of deaths from rabies in Britain, where it seems never to have reached epidemic proportions.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="13"> In Murray's view, however, the Channel Tunnel will be an irrelevance as far as the spread of rabies is concerned.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="14"> English sentimentality about animals and the vast number of pleasure craft crossing the Channel make it inevitable that one day a pet animal will come ashore somewhere - and reintroduce the virus.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="15"> When that happens, the British, like their neighbours and most of the rest of the world, will need to become accustomed to viewing parks, woods and fields as the haunt of a lurking killer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="16"> In the early 5th century, St Augustine of Hippo compiled a daunting list of the disasters that may at any moment fall on our defenceless heads: insanity, bankruptcy, imprisonment, torture, fire, stroke.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="17"> Among them he included rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="18"> Fifteen centuries later, does rabies really deserve its horrifying image?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="19"> After all, rabies vaccine is available both as a prophylactic and for treating those who have been in contact with an infected animal.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="20"> Vaccinated bait is widely and expensively used in programmes intented to control the spread of the disease among wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="21"> Yet the horrors of rabies can hardly be less fundamental today than when it stalked the cities of Roman North Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="22"> There is still no known cure.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="23"> Once clinical symptoms appear - fever, headache and 'a sense of apprehension' - its victims are doomed to a horrible death.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="24"> Both in France and in England, it used to be common practice to suffocate victims under mattresses.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="25"> Read any description of the effect of rabies and one sees the case for euthanasia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="26"> In its most common form, furious rabies, sufferers develop hydrophobia - a dread of water - which has been described by Prof David Warrell, an expert in tropical medicine, as 'the most terrible and mysterious symptom in the whole of medicine'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="27"> Rabies, says Warrell, 'remains the most. . . hopeless of human infections'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="28"> In short, there is little room for late 20th-century complacency.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="29"> All the more reason, then, to look with interest, if bemusement, at an extraordinary healing cult that flourished in a small village in north-west Europe for nine centuries.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="30"> Fear does strange things to people and so does hope.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="31"> Those two emotions, working powerfully together, with a dash of the profit motive thrown in, played a large role in the extraordinary and little-known history of St Hubert of the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="32"> St Hubert was an early 8th-century bishop of Liege who preached Christianity in the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="33"> A century after his death, monks carried his holy (and still incorrupt - ie, not mouldy) corpse from its grave in a church in Liege to an impoverished monastery high in the forest of the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="34"> The abbot and his monks badly needed a miracle-working relic to boost morale and attract pilgrims, and St Hubert conveniently started to perform healing miracles in his tomb.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="35"> After miraculous cures, many grateful pilgrims settled nearby, some of them with useful trades to ply, such as blacksmith.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="36"> And so, thanks to a saint's holy bones, a village sprang up.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="37"> Today Saint-Hubert-les-Ardennes is a charming, slate-roofed town modestly famous as the birthplace of the flower-painter Redoubte - and for the fetes de Saint-Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="38"> St Hubert is still known and loved throughout catholic northern Europe as the patron saint of hunters.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="39"> The tourist office, housed in the former mansion of the mighty abbots of Saint-Hubert, dispenses leaflets telling the picturesque legend of the saint's conversion.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="40"> Sadly - but not untypically - the legend has nothing to do with the real St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="41"> It is a barefaced example of monastic plagiarism, lifted from the Life of St Eustace.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="42"> The story goes that Hubert, a young nobleman, went hunting on Good Friday and was confronted by a white stag with a crucifix between its antlers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="43"> Christ reproached Hubert, whereupon he decided to enter the Church.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="44"> On September 25 and November 3, mass is celebrated in honour of St Hubert in the town's magnificent gothic church, punctuated by huntsmen blowing fanfares.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="45"> Tourists turn up for the fete in September, which is modestly promoted by the Belgian tourist office as a hunting festival: St Hubert still has a role to play in bringing revenue to his town.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="46"> In November, the atmosphere is more obviously spiritual.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="47"> Local people bring dogs and even horses to be blessed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="48"> In all this ceremony, there is nothing to remind visitors that the key to St Hubert's centuries of fame was his reputation as the saint who could prevent -and cure - rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="49"> As early as the 11th century, a monk wrote that it was standard practice for people bitten by rabid dogs and wolves to visit the shrine.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="50"> What happened there was very odd indeed and quite without parallel in the history of medieval shrines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="51"> A priest would make a cut in the pilgrim's forehead and push in a thread pulled from the saint's episcopal stole.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="52"> Later, the monks claimed that this stole had been woven in Heaven by the Virgin Mary and flown down to the saint by an angelic messenger.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="53"> As for the origin of the ritual, known as la taille, it is surely an instance of sympathetic magic.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="54"> In antiquity, rabies was one of many diseases blamed on worms - relatives of the poet William Blake's 'invisible worm that flies in the night'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="55"> Worms, under a dog's tongue or in its anus, were thought to cause rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="56"> It could well be that someone decided that because a white thread resembles a worm, it might expel the diabolic sickness of rabies if placed inside the head, close to the soul.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="57"> With the saint literally under their skin, people would not only be 'inoculated' against the risk of rabies: it was claimed they could be cured of the disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="58"> The disappearance of St Hubert's holy relics when Huguenots sacked the abbey was - and is - keenly felt.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="59"> However, the holy stole was safe, so the pilgrimage was unaffected.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="60"> Moreover, it was said that the holy stole never became any shorter.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="61"> Whether or not that is true, today it is a length of silk 105cm by 42mm of 11th- or 12th-century workmanship.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="62"> Normally, it can be seen in a reliquary on one of the altars.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="63"> However, on November 3, after mass, when the church has almost emptied, a priest holds it to the heads of the more devout.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="64"> In the 17th century, doctors of Paris University attacked the credibility of the stole and were furiously rebutted by supporters of this enormously popular pilgrimage.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="65"> Proof of its appeal is the sheer size of the church, its marble floor and magnificently carved stalls.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="66"> Records, kept at the shrine from 1653, were continued even after the abbey was secularised in the French revolution.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="67"> Early in the 18th century, a monk had noted that in four years, 1,956 people had been given la taille.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="68"> Between 1806 and 1834, some 4,800 were still seeking out St Hubert's healing power.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="69"> La taille still had its devotees in the 1920s.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="70"> It was said to be common for people fearful of contracting rabies to go to the Pasteur Instititue in Paris for inoculation, and - just to make sure - visit St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="71"> What, we may ask, was going on?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="72"> How could people have been deluded for so long into thinking that a visit to this saint's shrine had power over this most terrible of diseases?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="73"> On the face of it, the pilgrimage must seem like a mockery, a tragic waste of effort and expense.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="74"> The only justification would seem to be that during an agonising period of uncertainty, as sufferers and families waited to see if the dread symptoms appeared, the pilgrimage offered solace.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="75"> But there are more things to be said in explanation of the long 'success' of the pilgrimage to St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="76"> Many of the pilgrims must simply have made a mistake.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="77"> They thought they had been bitten by a mad beast, but it ran off so they had no proof.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="78"> Only pilgrims brought to the abbey from homes within a few days' journey could possibly have had furious rabies, since death occurs swiftly.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="79"> Many raging, barking, convulsing wretches who were tied to an iron ring by St Hubert's altar to await la taille must have been malades imaginaires.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="80"> They were suffering from rabies hysteria, a strange phenomenon which has been well documented in countries where rabies is prevalent.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="81"> Deluded sufferers are said to exhibit a terrifying range of symptoms associated with furious rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="82"> Doctors today suspect that they are dealing with this bizarre phenomenon whenever the symptoms follow hard on the heels of an animal bite.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="83"> One of the horrible features of rabies is that the virus commonly lies dormant for between 12 and 60 days.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="84"> The hysteric gives the game away by claiming he or she has been bitten only hours or a day or so earlier.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="85"> At the shrine, many an hysteric was no doubt swiftly 'cured' the instant they received the supernatural thread.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="86"> Conversely, and tragically, there were people who made the journey on foot, horse, or latterly by train, received la taille and, once they got home, faithfully kept the novena, the nine days of ritual observance.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="87"> It appeared they were cured, for the virus can take two years to become active.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="88"> In the end, they succumbed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="89"> Did anyone then think to inform the priest at Saint-Hubert, let alone accuse St Hubert of impotence?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="90"> The 'fail-safe' principle that explained the success of so many healing cults was not that Christianity taught that God's power, and that of his saints, worked automatically; on the contrary, God's power was an abyss which the mind of man could not plumb.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="91"> The silk stole of a saint was like a ladder over the abyss.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="92"> Many would cross in safety thanks to the power of their faith and the prayers of their loved ones.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="93"> But some would perish.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="94"> Even here, though, faith held out comfort to the bereaved - the thought that all those hours of racking agony would surely incline God to mercy at the hour of judgment.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="95"> Today, rabies is at large once more in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="96"> But there is no sign, so far, of a return of the cast of mind which, for nine centuries, gave St Hubert's stole its power .</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="9"> Just around dusk, Bob McAndrews says, you can see them fly from the old Town Hall into a darkening sky -- their furry bodies diving about herky-jerky, like distressed planes with a blind pilot at the controls.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="10"> "They come out at night in search of food and water," said McAndrews, the Olivenhain Town Council president.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="15"> Just look at all the droppings on the floor of the Town Hall and see for yourself".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="16"> For the past few months, officials in this Encinitas community, have been confounded by a creepy conundrum -- what to do about the hundreds of bats that have taken up residence in the rafters of their rustic, 95-year-old Town Hall.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="18"> "If you stand in the right spot, you can hear them twerping all day as they sleep," McAndrews said, calling attention to a cooing noise.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="22"> In recent months, however, hall users began noticing more and more bat droppings -- known as guano -- covering sections of the wooden floor like a sticky sawdust.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="23"> Officials even installed a lowered ceiling to stop the droppings from bombarding people who used the A-frame hall for gatherings such as 4-H Club get-togethers, weddings, and Halloween and Christmas parties.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="26"> Tests later showed that several of the bats were rabid, according to Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="28"> Though only a dozen of 97 bats tested last year were rabid, those sickly ones can pose a health hazard, he said.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="29"> That's when McAndrews and other town officials knew they had a problem.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="30"> They didn't even know how many bats they had, rabid or not.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="31"> And the county health department told them that state law prohibits the spraying of chemicals to kill the creatures.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="32"> So, who were they going to call?</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="39"> Experts told Olivenhain officials their Town Hall was home to a nursing colony of baby bats, mainly of two varieties -- the Mexican free-tailed and the big brown bat.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="40"> "They crawled inside little holes all over this place," said McAndrews, a real estate appraiser who himself has become a sort of armchair bat expert, consulting studies and charts.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="41"> "These little creatures can even squeeze through a quarter-inch crack.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="42"> There was no way to stop them".</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="43"> But the coming of fall may provide a solution.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="44"> The Mexican free-tailed bats soon will begin migrating south for the winter.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="45"> And officials have a little surprise for the others who stick around.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="46"> One upcoming evening, when the bats leave at twilight, officials plan to hastily erect a wire mesh screen over the holes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="47"> "That way, they can fly off, but they can't get back in," McAndrews said.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="50"> Some bat enthusiasts hope there's a positive ending to Olivenhain's bat drama -- including Martin Schuler, a member of Bat Conservation International and one of the experts called for consultation.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0061" num="51"> Schuler says his group often offers advice on how to rid residences of bats without killing them.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6565" num="7"> But the dogs only have themselves to blame; last year in Beijing alone 52,000 people were bitten.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6565" num="8"> Now The Workers' Daily has reported that in the past six years some 60,000 people have died of rabies throughout China.</s>

<s docid="FT944-6565" num="10"> It seems there are more than 100m dogs in China, of which a mere 10m are pets, and the remainder are bred to be eaten.</s>
