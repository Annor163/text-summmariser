<s docid="FT924-4990" num="6"> NEVER MIND what else Columbus did in 1492, so far as the Cubans are concerned, he discovered the cigar.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="7"> For those who are sticklers for detail, the Taino Indians he encountered on the Caribbean island were seen puffing some rolled-up leaves they called Cohiba.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="8"> Anyone visiting Havana these days, as I did earlier this month, will find much evidence of the famous admiral.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="9"> Columbus's presence is manifest not only in statues, busts and paintings but in the Cohiba cigars made famous by his fortuitous landfall five centuries ago this month.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="10"> The name Cohiba, in fact, was revived only a few decades ago by Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and was applied to a tiny selection of special cigars destined for various heads of state and the diplomatic community.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="11"> Cubatabaco, the state tobacco company, began giving the brand a commercial push in the 1980s, but its creation to be the 'best-of-the-best' of the two dozen or so famous marques of Havana cigars meant supplies falling well short of demand.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="12"> In planning last year for the 1992 anniversary, Cubatabaco started to take customer demand seriously by increasing output and broadening the existing six-size range to a full family of 11 different sizes, the five new ones simply being called Linea 1492.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="13"> This means that Cohiba now comes in all the basic sizes, but there is room for further expansion as the market develops.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="14"> No-one is predicting that its range will be as varied as the popular Romeo y Julieta, which has 22 different lengths and widths.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="15"> The new Linea 1492 types are known simply as Siglo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or, in English, Century 1 to 5.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="16"> Their lengths range from 4in to 6 3/4 inches, and their widths, or ring gauge, take a middle path from a minimum 40/64th of an inch in diameter to 46/64.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="17"> These will add to the existing six sizes which form the outer edges of the range - the Lanceros, Coronas Especiales and Panatelas at the narrower end and the hefty Esplendidos, Robustos and Exquisitos at the other.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="18"> Prices for the full Cohiba family range between Pounds 5 per cigar to Pounds 15.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="19"> The Cohiba has generally been described as a full-flavoured cigar but the various sizes and shapes will each have individual flavours thanks to careful leaf selection and use of special leaves that have undergone a third fermentation, which gives them a special heft.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="20"> Cubatabaco admits that one of the incentives to expand the Cohiba range came from the departure from the Havana trade a few years ago of Davidoff, the Swiss-based cigar maker.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="21"> Most merchants take the view that eventually all roads taken by discerning cigar smokers will lead to Havana, so the Davidoff move to the Dominican Republic represents something of a risk.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="22"> Davidoff only shifted manufacture after a prolonged and complicated row with the Cuban authorities, mainly about money, marketing and brand ownership.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="23"> This year, Davidoff has its 16 different Dominican sizes on the UK market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="24"> These range in price from Pounds 4.60 apiece, to its top range Anniversario No 1 at Pounds 20, one of the most expensive cigars on the market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="25"> Its continued high prices reflect its confidence that its Dominican dash will pay off.</s>

<s docid="FT924-4990" num="26"> Smokers will have to decide for themselves, but a case can be made for saying that Davidoff has bridged the gap between Havana and non-Havana.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="4"> FT 11 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba fumes over Havana name-game - Frank Gray reports on a legal battle over famous cigar brands</s>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="5"> By FRANK GRAY</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="6"> CUBATABACO, the state company responsible for supplying Cuba's famous Havana hand-made cigars, is locked in an angry dispute with its largest customer, Tabacalera, the Spanish state cigar giant.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="7"> Tabacalera, which owns the three Havana marques, Upmann, Montecristo and Larranaga, has withdrawn those brands from several key European markets, notably France, as a result of litigation started in the 1980s by the three brands' former owners, Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="8"> Tabacalera bought the brands from the US group a few years ago and carried the case forward in the French courts.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="9"> The French court ruled last summer that Tabacalera's French counterpart, Seita, could no longer sell the Cuban-made brands in France.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="10"> According to Cubatabaco officials, this has caused a row between it and Tabacalera that could see the withdrawal of the same three marques from other markets.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="11"> Spain last year imported 28m cigars from Cuba, more than a third of its 80m exports.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="12"> Mr Francisco Padron, head of Cubatabaco, said in an interview that Cuba was prepared to resume exporting the same three marques to France but with different labels 'as early as next year'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="13"> It might resume sales to Spain as well, Mr Padron said, but this would require the setting up of an independent importing agency in Spain and aggravating already tense relations with Tabacalera.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="14"> Cubatabaco was in discussions with Tabacalera over the impasse.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="15"> 'They are being difficult, but they are no longer a complete monopoly.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="16"> This means we can be an importer into Spain,' Mr Padron said.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="17"> 'Tabacalera's profits from Havana cigar imports are too big for our taste, even though it is our biggest market, although our supplies have slipped from 34m a few years ago to 28m last year'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="18"> The nub of the dispute is the fact that the three marques, of which Upmann and Montecristo are by far the most famous, are produced in other cigar-manufacturing countries, such as the Dominican Republic (as are numerous other famous Havana marques such as Partagas and Romeo y Julieta, though these are not, as yet, subjects of litigation).</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="19"> This anomaly arose in the 1960s following the Cuban revolution and the subsequent expropriation of the famous cigar companies.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="20"> Many cigar company proprietors switched production offshore but did not have the economic clout to raise a lawsuit against Cuba over the continued production within Cuba of the same brands.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="21"> This only became possible when the US group took control of some of the offshore brands, which has now moved to Tabacalera.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="22"> Tabacalera controls the brand names for all markets outside the US.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="23"> The sale side-by-side in some overseas markets of Havana and non-Havana cigars bearing the same labels is creating market ambiguity, say Cubatabaco officials, and diverts attention from the acknowledged supremacy of Havana cigars.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="24"> This has prompted Cubatabaco to undertake new strategies in Europe to boost sales and broaden its revenue base.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="25"> A few years ago, a Swiss holding company was established by Cubatabaco to take a minority stake in importing companies, such as Coprova of France, a small competitor to Seita, and Hunters and Frankau of the UK, the prime UK importer.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="26"> Mr Padron said that strategy was being expanded to include the establishment of Havana Houses in certain markets.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="27"> These were franchise retail outlets, which would be supplied by Cubatabaco-approved suppliers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="28"> One had been set up in Cancun, Mexico, he said, another was planned for next year in Paris and a so-called Cohiba Divan had been established in Hong Kong.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="29"> Others were being considered for Tokyo and the Middle East.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="30"> A third element of the strategy is beefing up production of Cuba's post-revolution 'own brand' the top marque Cohiba cigar, partly to fill the void created by the departure of Swiss-based Davidoff from the Havana market into Dominican Republic cigars.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="31"> Cubatabaco last week used the occasion of the Fifth Centenary Anniversary Conference in Havana celebrating Christopher Columbus's discovery of tobacco (for it was in Cuba that the explorer saw Indians smoking rolled up tobacco leaves on his first voyage) to display the latest range of Cohiba cigars.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="32"> These, at least, will be exempt from brand-ownership disputes abroad, officials point out.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="33"> One official noted that, for its part, Cuba had successfully caused the withdrawal of 50 brands from the international market place for erroneously claiming to be Havana cigars.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="34"> Mr Padron acknowledged that the Cuban tobacco industry was undercapitalised.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="35"> 'We are having good crops, but the problems are in the fields (58,000 hectares were under cultivation).</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="36"> We are suffering investment shortages,' he said, 'some of which have been caused by the collapse of Comecon'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="37"> Cuba, he said, was supplying 10m-11m mainly machine-made cigars a year into eastern Europe, partly paid for through barter arrangements, but this had been shaken up.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="38"> Cuba now was having to reorientate itself to the eastern European markets, through the setting up of 'joint accounts' in all the region's capital cities.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="39"> Of total sales last year of 250m cigars, 80m were exported.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8332" num="40"> Export revenues for all Cuban tobacco was Dollars 115m, of which about Dollars 75m came from cigars, he said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="29"> One of them is Dennis Martin, 48, a Santa Ana real estate appraiser, who said he goes through perhaps 50 of Frias' larger coronas "every week to 10 days.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="32"> Martin, like many cigar aficionados, never smoked cigarettes ("They just smell dry to me").</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="33"> Two of his uncles smoked cigars, he said, and when he took up the practice "when I was about 15 or 16," it was love at first puff.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="37"> It's the flavor from the smoke that does it for you.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="39"> Which is exactly what Henry Schielein arranged last April.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="40"> Schielein, vice president and general manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point -- a man for whom cigar smoking is a pleasure bordering on the religious -- has become a kind of patron saint of Orange County cigar lovers, largely as a result of a lavish "smoker" he threw nine months ago at the hotel for 60 lovers of the leaf.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="41"> The evening was designed to commemorate the dedication of one of the hotel's rooms, known as the Library, as a smoking room where pipe and cigar smokers could enjoy their tobacco after dinner in the evenings (during the day, it is used as a nonsmoking tea room).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="42"> For $175, the guests got a lavish steak dinner and a chance to fire up (and take home) some of the more than 1,000 cigars provided for the evening by various cigar manufacturers and distributors.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="43"> Schielein said he wants to make the smoker an annual event, and has scheduled another one for April.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="44"> He has received several letters from cigar lovers angling for invitations, but he said the guest list will be necessarily limited.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="45"> He doesn't want to lose the comradely atmosphere that he says is part of the cigar mystique.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="46"> "This is the perfect room for smoking," said Schielein, waving an arm at the darkly paneled Library.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="47"> "I think it sets a mood.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="48"> You don't light a cigar if you're in a hurry.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="49"> You sit back and you enjoy it.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="50"> You can smoke here without worrying about somebody getting upset.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="51"> That's the critical thing.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="52"> (The Library) has been favorably received because there are an awful lot of guys who like a good cigar".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="53"> Schielein began his love affair with the leaf when he was a 21-year-old steward on a cruise ship that had put into Havana Harbor.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="54"> "We got off the ship and hit this bar, the Two Brothers Bar, and inside on the bar there was a box of cigars," he said.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="57"> It is, however, not a universal love, as Joseph De Franco, whom Schielein calls "a cigar fanatic," has found.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="58"> "You must take care that you don't offend someone else," said De Franco, a Corona del Mar resident who is the president and chief executive officer of a hazardous waste treatment business.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="59"> "I'll always ask permission to smoke them.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="60"> On several occasions when a restaurant manager has said that smoking was permitted, the owner has come out and said, 'My God, that's a terrible smell,' and so I apologize and let the cigar go out.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="61"> I don't want my pleasure to be someone else's displeasure".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="62"> Still, there are restaurants and hotels in Orange County where cigar smoking is permitted, if on a smaller and less visible scale than at the Ritz-Carlton.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="63"> At the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach, for instance, cigar smoking is permitted in the Pavilion dining room and cigars are available to diners on request.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="64"> And at the Chez Cary restaurant in Orange, a selection of cigars is kept behind the bar for patrons who ask for them.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="65"> Other restaurants, however, forbid cigar smoking.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="66"> At the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach "we really discourage cigar smoking," said day manager Judy Simpson.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="67"> "It does nothing to enhance your dining.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="68"> On the menus, we have a little blurb that says that we request that pipe and cigar smoking be confined to the lounge and bar area".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="69"> The European tradition of restaurants routinely offering after-dinner cigars to their patrons is nearly non-existent in America today, Schielein said, and statistics bear that out.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="70"> According to the Washington-based Cigar Assn. of America, cigar smoking has been on the decline in the United States, at a rate of about 8% a year since the U.S. surgeon general's report on smoking was published in 1964.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="71"> In that year, more than 8.9 billion cigars were sold nationwide.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="72"> In 1988, that figure had dropped to slightly more than 2.5 billion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="73"> (Health risks are substantially less for cigar smokers than for cigarette smokers, cigar fanciers are quick to point out.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="74"> An American Cancer Society study published in 1982 found that while the risk of getting any form of cancer is twice as high for cigarette smokers as for nonsmokers, that risk goes up by only a third for cigar smokers).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="75"> Still, new cigar smokers are emerging.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="76"> "There are a lot of young guys out there who like a good cigar," Schielein said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="77"> "It's not for old men only".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="78"> Jeffrey Wagner, president of the Cigar Warehouse, a pair of Los Angeles stores specializing in cigars, said his business is "up by about 30% from last year.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="79"> Our business used to be older men, but we're getting younger people now.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="80"> Most of our business is with young executives in their late 20s or early 30s.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="81"> "It's a sign of success to them.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="82"> Generally speaking, they're given a promotion, or they see the senior partner smoking a cigar, or they see executives higher up than they are smoking a cigar, or they're given a cigar at a meeting by someone who has prestige, or they see Bill Cosby or David Letterman or Milton Berle or George Burns smoking cigars and they want to be like these successful people".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="83"> Orange County tobacconists said that they also are serving younger customers and that they generally go for higher-priced imported cigars, some in the $9 to $10 range.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="84"> Eric Root, manager of the Tinder Box in the Orange Mall, which also sells pipe tobacco, said "29% of my weekly business is in cigars, and that's a substantial amount of the business we do".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="85"> And, say cigar lovers, the novices eventually find themselves part of a kind of fraternal sub-strata of smokers, with new signs and rituals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="86"> "I smoke a cigar maybe six times a year, and I usually buy them from the Teri Cigar Co.," said R.D. Ferguson, a 33-year-old investment banker from Anaheim.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="87"> "And I only do it when I'm with the guys.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="88"> I never smoke by myself.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="89"> It's a cliche, but I suppose it's just male bonding.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="90"> And I like the taste.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="91"> It's a pleasant bite, and it's relaxing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="92"> Few women smoke cigars, but many say they like the smell, Schielein said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="93"> And there are others who pursue the leaf more actively.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="94"> "No question, there are a lot of women who like good cigars, particularly small cigars," Schielein said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="95"> "In Boston, a group of women have their own little cigar club at the Ritz-Carlton there, and one of the members is Anwar Sadat's daughter.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="96"> She's a cigar fanatic".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="97"> Schielein's own marriage, he said, was contingent on his wife's attitude toward cigars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="98"> "I made a deal with my wife before we got married," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="99"> "I said, 'Don't ever ask me to stop smoking cigars'.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="100"> I wouldn't have gotten married if she had.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="101"> We've been married more than 25 years".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="102"> There is even a kind of missionary zeal among cigar lovers, De Franco believes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="103"> "A cigar smoker will share his leaf with other people," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="104"> "I smoke about five or six a day and generally give away that many or more a week".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="105"> And, Schielein said, a kind of collect-'em-trade-'em ritual exists because "a cigar smoker, when he smells a good cigar, is not afraid to come up to you and ask what you're smoking".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="106"> It all contributes, he said, to a devotion that few inanimate objects enjoy.</s>

<s docid="LA010590-0159" num="107"> And it is surely a sign of that deep feeling that Schielein can quote Mark Twain on the subject of cigars and appear to agree with every single word:</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="6"> ON ROLLING plains about 50 miles to the north of Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, almost 7,000 acres of land previously under sugar cane have been taken up by seemingly unending rows of pineapple plants.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="7"> To the east of the capital, in the sugar town of La Romana, a new meat processing plant is expanding capacity to meet growing demand in foreign markets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="8"> These ventures are part of the cutting edge of a dramatic change in agriculture in the Dominican Republic.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="9"> Up to 10 years ago the agriculture sector was dominated by traditional crops such as sugar (which for long was the backbone of the economy), coffee, cocoa and tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="10"> Now non-traditional crops are getting more attention from local farmers, the government and foreign investors.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="11"> The sugar, coffee, cocoa and tobacco sectors have performed miserably in the past decade, due to a combination of domestic and foreign market developments.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="12"> There has been a concurrent expansion of the non-traditional sector, with investments in new crops reaching Dollars 350m over the past eight years, and earnings from exports rising to Dollars 430m in 1988, and expected to reach just over Dollars 600m this year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="13"> The Joint Agribusiness Co-investment Council, which promotes the development of non-traditional agriculture, says the expansion is reflected particularly in the production of pineapples, citrus, melons, mangoes, vegetables, cut flowers and ornamental plants.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="14"> The expansion has also been encouraged by a mixture of government incentives and market opportunities.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="15"> One significant development has been the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a US trade prog- ramme which allows countries designated by Washington to ship a range of products, also selected by the US govern- ment, duty-free to the US market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="16"> More recently, the Dominican Republic became a beneficiary of the Lome Convention which allows preferential access to the European Community.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="17"> Already the country is increasing its exports of non-traditional agricultural products to Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="18"> Pineapples, citrus and juice concentrate are among the products making use of preferential access to both the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Lome Convention'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="19"> Dole Dominicana produces about 2.5m (40lb) boxes of pineapples a year, and 800,000 gallons of juice concentrate.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="20"> The company plans to invest another Dollars 1m to expand the facility, which already gives the Dominican government about Dollars 1.5m in rental fees and sales.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="21"> Agrocarne, a Dollars 16m joint venture between local investors and Campo Frio of Spain, was drawn to the Dominican Republic for much the same reasons, according to Mr Luis Rodriguez, the company's export manager.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="22"> 'We could have gone to other places, but labour here is cheaper and the location, in relation to the markets we want to access, is very good'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="23"> The company's processed pork products are currently exported to Mexico and some Caribbean islands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="24"> Agrocarne also supplies part of domestic demand.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="25"> It is now awaiting the conclusion of negotiations between the Dominican Republic and the US on the conditions under which Dominican pork products can enter the American market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="26"> Even the non-traditional agriculture sector has not been immune to problems which have troubled the Dominican economy over the past decade.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="27"> Those which have proved most worrisome include the lack of chemicals to fight pests, restrictions on products (such as some varieties of vegetables and fruit) entering the US market, and outdated practices in farm management, post-harvest handling and packaging and marketing.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="28"> Mr Fleming says that there need to be changes to some 'old bad habits and attitudes' in the Dominican Republic, if the agriculture sector is to continue expanding.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="29"> 'The Dominican Republic is operating against the clock in the face of changes which will be created by the widening of the North American Free Trade Area and the possibility of changes in Cuba,' he observes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="30"> The concentration on non-traditional agriculture has diverted attention from the traditional crops.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="31"> While the financially embarrassed State Sugar Council is attempting to rationalise its operations, coffee and cocoa output continue to be victims of outdated husbandry.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="32"> Peasant farmers who should have profited from land reform with the break-up of large plantations owned by Pres- ident Rafael Trujillo have found themselves unable to get farm credit because they have received only provisional titles which bankers find to be unsatisfactory collateral.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="33"> Coffee and cocoa output has fluctuated over the past decade, and although still important foreign currency earners, both crops have been affected by the uncertainties of a volatile market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="34"> The expansion in the output of non-traditional products has helped to stem a decline in the agriculture sector, which accounts for 15 per cent of the gross domestic product.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="35"> One promising area is tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="36"> Exports of cigars have been increasing as the Dominican Republic makes use of new market opportunities.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="37"> 'The Dominican Republic exports between 58m and 60m cigars each year, with the major market being the US, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the product,' says Mr Jose Seijas, general manager of Tabacalera de Garcia, one of the country's leading cigar manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6639" num="38"> 'Between 10 and 15 per cent of the country's cigar exports now go to the European Community.'</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="11"> At least one Los Angeles restaurateur thinks this is a shame, and has decided to do something about it -- once a month, at any rate.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="12"> Starting Nov. 6, Patrick Terrail will institute monthly "Cigar Smokers' Nights" at his Ma Maison in West Hollywood's Ma Maison Sofitel Hotel.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="13"> A special seven-course menu degustation (at $59 per person) will be offered in addition to the regular menu, and Dunhill will set up a "cigar buffet," offering a large selection of cigars to smokers who have not brought their own.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="14"> A newly enlarged selection of Cognacs and other after-dinner drinks will supplement the cigars.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="15"> "We have a lot of guests who enjoy a cigar after their meal," Terrail explains, "and usually we have to ask them to move to the bar.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="16"> But somebody who spends a couple hundred dollars on a good meal doesn't necessarily want to be moved around the minute he's finished.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="17"> So I decided to have one night a month when the cigar smoker would have the right of way".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="18"> But won't the ghost of cigar smoke linger in the room for a day or two after the event, possibly offending later diners?</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="20"> Cigar Smokers' Nights will be held on the first Monday of every month at Ma Maison until further notice.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="21"> Terrail stresses, in conclusion, that non-cigar smokers will be welcome on these evenings -- "But, of course," he adds, "they won't be able to say, 'Will you please put that thing out'. "</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="22"> A NO-SHOW PLAN THAT MIGHT JUST FLY: Whenever the issue of charging restaurant "no-shows" for unkept reservations is being debated, supporters of the notion tend to point out that hotels do levy such charges; opponents counter that airlines do not.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="23"> That latter point isn't completely valid anymore.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="24"> The government of Singapore now permits all airlines serving that tiny nation to charge the equivalent of about $80 to customers who buy tickets and make reservations in Singapore itself and then let those reservations lapse.</s>

<s docid="LA102989-0038" num="25"> The airline no-show problem is particularly dire in Singapore, as it happens, since local law prohibits overbooking or the resale of seats which are already theoretically sold.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="6"> THE future of the Cuban cigar trade in Europe has been thrown into doubt after a French court barred the import of three leading brands because of a trademark violation.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="7"> The three brands are Monte Cristo, H.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="8"> Upmann and Por Larranaga.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="9"> According to Seita, France's largest tobacco goods distributor, these marques comprise about 50 per cent of French Cuban cigar imports of 7.7m.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="10"> However, Cuba pledged yesterday that the court ban would not deprive connoisseur French smokers of their cigars.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="11"> Cubatabaco, the state tobacco agency, said it would send other prestigious Havana brands to replace the three banned names.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="12"> Mr Patrick Clayeux, a senior manager for Seita, said yesterday the company would stop distributing the three brands on August 14.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="13"> All retail sales must stop by September 7.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="14"> Surplus stocks would be withdrawn from retail outlets.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="15"> In addition, Seita is obliged to stop production of Mini-Montecristo 'whiff' cigars, manufactured in France with imported raw Cuban tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="16"> The landmark lawsuit, settled recently in a French appeals court ruling, stems from a dispute over the ownership of the three famous brands, whose proprietors fled Cuba following the 1959 revolution.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="17"> Cuba, under Cubatabaco, has continued their manufacture since.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="18"> In 1976, the former owners sold the marques to Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US, which launched the orginal challenge in various international courts.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11563" num="19"> CCB in the late 1980s sold the non-US use of the brand names to Tabacalera, the Spanish distributor, which now controls them for all non-US business.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="5"> By TOM BURNS</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="6"> As secretary of state for the economy Mr Pedro Perez struggled for five years to reduce the public deficit, to increase Spain's competitiveness and to curb tax evasion.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="7"> Since last October Mr Perez has been conducting a similar battle as chairman of Tabacalera, the government-controlled manufacturer and monopoly distributor of tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="8"> Tabacalera's balance sheet is not unlike what Spain's has looked like since the domestic economy dipped into recession two years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="9"> Profits at the tobacco group's parent company tumbled by 46 per cent to Pta10.7bn (Dollars 78.6m) in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="10"> Mr Perez is thus again fully involved in cutting costs, in lifting productivity and combatting tobacco smugglers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="11"> If all goes to plan, Mr Perez expects profits at Tabacalera, of which the government holds 52 per cent and foreign investors 38 per cent, to recover by 30 per cent this year.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="12"> Last month the board approved a 45 per cent dividend cut in line with the 1993 profit shortfall.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="13"> 'So far Perez is looking good.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="14"> He is creating a sense of austerity at Tabacalera and that is new,' says Mr Joaquin Tamames, senior partner at Axel, the Madrid investment bank.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="15"> The dividend cut was welcomed as 'realistic'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="16"> Tabacalera expects to reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year, partly by slashing sponsorship expenditure and partly by personnel cuts.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="17"> Victims of the austerity programme range from the ocean-going yacht Fortuna (a Tabacalera brand), which was forced to pull out of the round-the-world race, to a top symphony orchestra festival in Madrid which has been cancelled following a ruthless cut to Pta250m from Pta1.2bn in the annual budget of Tabacalera's arts foundation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="18"> Tabacalera's labour force, which stood at 8,000 when Mr Perez took over at the group, is likely to be reduced by more than 1,300 in the medium-term.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="19"> By the end of March almost 500 had accepted voluntary redundancy terms negotiated by Mr Perez with the unions last November.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="20"> Tabacalera's chairman has still not tackled the issue of scaling down the 13 production plants that the group operates in Spain.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="21"> But he is anxious to make use of the new labour regulations that permit companies to enforce geographical and functional mobility on their employees.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="22"> The clampdown on tobacco smuggling, following the introduction of legislation at the end of last year to allow stronger policing and heavier fines, should have at least as important an impact on the 1994 margin as will the cost cuts.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="23"> Tabacalera estimates that some 20 per cent of the high quality brand tobacco -Winston and Marlboro - acquired in Spain last year was smuggled and that contraband increased by more than 40 per cent between 1992 and 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="24"> Tabacalera's sales fell overall by 7 per cent last year and this was not because Spaniards, who have the highest per capita cigarette consumption in the EU, were smoking a lot less.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="25"> The contraband legislation appears to have delivered startling results.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="26"> In January and February this year Tabacalera's sales were up 7.3 per cent on the first two months of 1993 and sales of Winston and Marlboro shot up by 22.6 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="27"> 'If sales continue to climb, by the summer we will be seeing a clear change in the trend with the smugglers on the retreat,' says Mr Pedro Arbex, a tobacco industry analyst at Madrid brokers Benito y Monjardin.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="28"> The final plank of Mr Perez's platform in his first year as chairman has a somewhat deja vu air to it, as it has to do with the 'back to the core tobacco business' strategy that has been promised off and on since 1991 by his previous two predecessors.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="29"> This time the chances are that Mr Perez will succeed in pushing the policy through.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="30"> This is in part because Mr Perez inherits Tabacalera's Pta17.25bn disposal last July of 50 per cent of its food subsidiary, Royal Brands, to RJR Nabisco of the US.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="31"> Should the US group take up its option to buy Royal Brands outright in March next year, Tabacalera will be forced to concentrate fully on its tobacco business and will have the cash at hand to do so productively.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="32"> It is also because Mr Perez has completed complex negotiations with Cubatabaco, the Cuban government's tobacco business, which, by virtue of the Spanish company's partial financing of tobacco processing in Cuba, will gain Tabacalera a near monopoly of Cuban cigars in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="33"> Mr Perez, who was almost a chain smoker when he was a politician but now sticks to Havanas, plans several more 'core tobacco business' initiatives for the European market before the year is out.</s>

<s docid="FT942-16545" num="34"> He is also preparing joint ventures aimed at eastern Europe and east Asia, but is keeping his cards close to his chest.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="5"> Low-level Contaminants Experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure of susceptible people to low level mixtures of VOCs have induced mucous membrane irritation and pulmonary effects.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="6"> Some of these studies are discussed below.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="7"> The potential of indoor air contamination to produce adverse effects in humans was demonstrated by Molhave et al. in Denmark [Ex.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="8"> 4-20]. These researchers studied 62 subjects suffering from ``indoor climate symptoms''.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="9"> These subjects reported primarily eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, but were otherwise healthy individuals that did not suffer from asthma, allergy, or bronchitis.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="10"> The subjects were exposed to a mixture of VOCs in concentrations of 0, 5, or 25 mg/m 3. These concentrations respectively represented ``clean'' air, average polluted air, and the maximum polluted air in Danish households.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="11"> After exposure, a Digit Span test was administered.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="12"> The study found significant declines in performance on this test; demonstrating that low-level exposures to volatile organic compounds had an adverse effect on the ability to concentrate [Ex.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="14"> [Ex. 4-248], repeating the Molhave et al.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="15"> (1984) experiment, studied 66 healthy subjects with no history of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="17"> Otto et al. reported that while subjects found the odor of chemicals unpleasant, to degrade indoor air quality, to increase headache, and produce general discomfort, VOC exposure for 2.75 hours duration did not affect performance on any behavioral tests.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="18"> These results imply that persons who experience symptoms of SBS may have a lower threshold for certain health effects compared to nonreactive people.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="19"> This suggests that those with compromised immune response (e.g.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="22"> [Ex. 4-2] found that synergistic effects may occur when one strong indoor irritant interacts with other indoor contaminants present at low-level concentrations.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="23"> Ahlstrom et al. found that there was almost a 4-fold increase in the perceived odor strength of formaldehyde at low concentration (0.08 ppm) when mixed with 100% indoor air from a building where SBS was reported, relative to 10% indoor air from the same building.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="24"> The Report of the Canadian Interministerial Committee on Indoor Air Quality [Ex.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="25"> 4-264] adopts the World Health Organization's definition of health: ``Health refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being, and not just the absence of disease or infirmity''.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="26"> This definition was adopted to allow the setting of indoor air quality guidelines based on ``comfort'' as well as ``health''.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="27"> The report observes that the symptoms of SBS are sufficiently general or subjective that they may be indicative of several other medical conditions.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="28"> Therefore, perhaps the best indicator that workplace exposure may play a role in the symptoms reported by an individual is the observation that symptoms worsen during the work day, and disappear shortly after leaving work.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="29"> They state that because there is a wide variation in individual susceptibility, based on genetics, age, medication, previous exposure to pollutants, gender, and state of health, especially those with allergies, that certain individuals may be more sensitive to SBS than others.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="30"> 2. Bioaerosols The levels of bioaerosols in the indoor environment should reflect those found in the outdoor environment.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="33"> If indoor and outdoor sampling results are not comparable, then it is possible that a reservoir of a particular microbe may be amplifying in the indoor environment; especially if moisture and a nutrient-rich substrate are available [Ex.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="35"> Commonly found in the outdoor environment, the bacteria are as expected, commonly found in untreated potable and nonpotable water.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="42"> 3. Environmental Tobacco Smoke The burning of tobacco in enclosed workplaces releases an aerosol containing a large variety of solid, liquid, and gas phase chemical compounds.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="43"> Generation of tobacco smoke is governed by the source emission characteristics of smokers and their tobacco products, whereas removal is primarily determined by the rate of replacement of building air by outside air, with re-emission of surface-sorbed compounds playing a minor role.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="44"> Natural and mechanical ventilation systems are designed primarily to limit the accumulation of the products of human respiratory metabolism, and secondarily to limit odor; not to control the byproducts of biomass combustion.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="45"> Thus, smoking indoors creates air pollution which is not adequately abated by customary ventilation systems.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="46"> Exposure to tobacco smoke primarily occurs through the inhalation route.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="47"> Such an exposure can be measured by the determination of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of tobacco smoke constituents and/or their metabolites.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="48"> However, relatively few of these individual constituents have been identified and characterized.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="49"> Also, measurement of all components in tobacco smoke is not feasible.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="50"> Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify a marker which, when measured, will accurately represent the frequency, duration and magnitude of the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="51"> This discussion reviews available data for the purposes of assessing exposure to ETS in the workplace.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="52"> Nonsmokers are exposed to mainstream smoke after it has been exhaled by smokers, and to diluted sidestream smoke.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="53"> Issues covered include activity patterns affecting the duration of nonsmokers' exposures, the concentrations of ETS in buildings, the comparison of ETS components in indoor workplaces, levels of biomarkers in workers, and the inadequacy of general dilution ventilation to address ETS exposure control.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="54"> This discussion will indicate not only that exposure occurs, but that nonsmokers absorb ETS components.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="55"> (a) Chemistry.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="56"> Pipe, cigar, and cigarette smoke all contribute to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) but cigarette smoke is of principal interest because it is by far the most common.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="57"> Tables III-6 and III-7 list some of the known constituents of tobacco smoke.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="58"> The combustion of tobacco leads to the formation of mainstream smoke (MS) and sidestream smoke (SS).</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="59"> MS is generated during puff-drawing in the burning cone and hot zones; it travels through the tobacco column and is inhaled by the smoker.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="60"> The smoke which is exhaled by the smoker, while different from the inhaled smoke, is also considered ``mainstream''.</s>

<s docid="FR940405-1-00062" num="61"> SS is formed in between puff-drawing and is emitted directly from the smoldering tobacco product into the ambient air .</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="16"> Cuban Workers Federation, by Open Dialogue host Soledad Cruz -- live in studio] [Text] [Cruz] As we had announced, Pedro Ross is back with us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="17"> Many listeners have called in to ask questions that remained unanswered during the Open Agenda program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="18"> This whole week we have been following what I have called Parliament in the Work Place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="19"> This is a topic of much interest in the country because our future and life, and the country's future depend on this process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="20"> That is why we are all anxious to know how this process is going to be conducted and how we can participate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="21"> This is what I believe is most important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="22"> This is truly an exercise of participative democracy and is very important because the country is experiencing difficult times and strong measures must be adopted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="23"> In light of our past way of life, it is necessary that the people understand the process and contribute to it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="24"> Welcome, Pedro Ross.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="25"> I would also like to thank Pantoja [not further identified] for his help in getting the program organized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="26"> Pantoja has some 19 questions to ask, and I myself have five questions sent in by Open Dialogue listeners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="27"> However, I believe that the first thing we should do is ask you what you think has been the most important aspect of this first week of meetings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="28"> [Ross] Good morning to the listeners of this very much-awaited Saturday program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="29"> Well Soledad, I believe that the seriousness with which the workers have broached the various issues up for discussion in the Parliaments in the Work Place are broaching these matters has been the most important aspect of this first week.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="30"> This is not only important, but encouraging.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="31"> We have seen a conscientious patriotic sense.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="32"> I am describing it as conscientious because the people are aware of what is being discussed, what it entails, and of what they are proposing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="33"> They are not proposing measures to affect others.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="34"> They are aware of the fact that the measures they are proposing entail some sacrifice for them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="35"> I have heard workers, people who do not earn much, say that we must analyze the issue of price increases; I have heard them say that the free public health and education systems should not be eliminated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="36"> More than 30 percent of the country's budget goes to cover these two services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="37"> For example, there are provinces like Pinar del Rio -- I got back last night from Pinar del Rio where Ricardo Alarcon and I attended a meeting with provincial leaders -- where 70 percent of the budget goes to health and education.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="38"> I have been amazed at how the people are participating.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="39"> The people are preparing for these meetings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="40"> They are reading the editorials published by TRABAJADORES, they are listening to the opinions expressed by reporters and leaders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="41"> Ricardo Alarcon was interviewed on this station on this topic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="42"> The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] was broadcast for everyone to understand all that is being done and what the goals are.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="43"> These meetings are an extension of the debates that began at the ANPP; however, we are not rehashing what was said at the ANPP.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="44"> Much creativity is observed at these Parliaments in the Work Place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="45"> This process we have begun is basically aimed at giving the workers the opportunity to analyze the economic situation of their workplace, their enterprise, their establishment, their shop, or their subsidized unit -- if they work for a subsidized unit -- and for them to suggest how they can improve the work and how they can change the unprofitable status that most of the enterprises have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="46"> As everyone knows, only 31 percent of the country's enterprises are profitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="47"> If we continue to experience this situation, the country will not be able to overcome its problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="48"> No matter how many measures are adopted, no matter how much excess currency is taken off the street, no matter how many taxes are implemented, the situation will not change if we do not reverse the economic situation of our enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="49"> We must contribute to lower budget expenditure.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="50"> We cannot continue to spend more than we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="51"> We have been spending more than we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="52"> [Cruz] I have always compared the phenomenon of our economy with a basket or a sack.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="53"> It is full and you keep pulling things out.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="54"> If you do not refill it, it will eventually be empty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="55"> This is basically what is happening with our economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="56"> [Ross] I compare it with a cow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="57"> If you milk the cow time after time, but never feed it or give it water, it will get sick and eventually die.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="58"> [Cruz] One of the questions we have received is: How long will the streamlining of the economy last?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="59"> Will it be a month?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="60"> Will it be a year?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="61"> The rate at which the economic measures are adopted worries me.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="62"> I have heard some people say that they are worried because they do not know how long this discussion process will last.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="63"> [Ross] The streamlining of the economy must be a constant process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="64"> It is a process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="65"> The economy must not only be streamlined, but also healthy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="66"> The economic situation of our production and service enterprises and the subsidized enterprises will depend on our having the necessary resources to fulfill the plans the country has.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="67"> Therefore, this is something we must constantly strive for.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="68"> This process opens a new cycle of economic education for our workers and administrators.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="69"> We must learn that we will only achieve what we want by working efficiently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="70"> If we have one peso and invest that peso, we must find a way to double our investment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="71"> This is what will allow us to expand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="72"> To put it simply, we are seeking to make more than we invest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="73"> We must be consistent in this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="74"> We believe that this process will be extended through late February, maybe early March.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="75"> We must prepare well.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="76"> We do not want this to be a marathon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="77"> The idea is not to meet a deadline, saying that we have talked to the workers and they agree with everything.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="78"> We are not reaching agreements.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="79"> We are making suggestions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="80"> We are analyzing problems, and the people are making recommendations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="81"> These recommendations are gathered and those that can be implemented immediately at a work center are implemented.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="82"> The people want to know when the measures will be implemented.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="83"> We must begin implementing the measures immediately, especially those measures aimed at increasing economic efficiency, stopping squandering.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="84"> [Pantoja] To do something like that we do not have to wait for an agreement to be reached.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="85"> [Ross] That is correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="86"> And this is important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="87"> What worries the people the most are those measures adopted to streamline finances, to streamline our financial situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="88"> However, we can streamline, but if we do not solve the economic efficiency problem, we will end up with this very same situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="89"> This is the core of the matter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="90"> [Cruz] The people on the street keep asking me one question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="91"> Social justice is nothing more than equal distribution of the money made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="92"> The question is: How are we going to make money with so many problems?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="93"> What can be done to increase production?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="94"> Can we produce more despite the problems we encounter with the inefficiency, mismanagement, and poor working methods we have?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="95"> These problems have caused our production to decrease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="96"> Decreased production is also due to the collapse of the socialist bloc and the blockade we are experiencing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="97"> However, part of this problem is due to our inefficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="98"> [Ross] That is the problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="99"> The socialist bloc has collapsed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="100"> That is a fact and it created this problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="101"> The sugarmills are operating.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="102"> We must work that sector with efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="103"> Our country's economy depends on this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="104"> During the last session of the ANPP.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="105"> Fidel encouraged us to continue producing sugar, to ensure that every single pound of sugar is produced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="106"> [Pantoja] To produce with quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="107"> [Ross] To produce with quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="108"> Yesterday, Comrade Carlos Lage was in Camaguey and talked about this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="109"> We depend on our sugar to get the oil we need to cover our electricity needs, to operate our factories, to operate the transportation we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="110"> There is talk that this year, 200 camels, as the train-buses are called by the people, will be added to the system and these need fuel to operate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="111"> That fuel is bought with the money we get from our sugar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="112"> Sugar brings in most of our foreign exchange.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="113"> We must produce sugar efficiently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="114"> Our ton of sugar must yield more.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="115"> If producing a ton of sugar costs us 200 [currency not specified] and this is how much we sell it for, then we are getting nowhere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="116"> If producing it costs us 150 [currency not specified], then we have made 50 in profit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="117"> But if we produce it for 100 and sell it for 200, then we have 100 profit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="118"> You know that 100 is more than 50.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="119"> That is what this is all about.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="120"> The idea is to ensure that the available resources are properly utilized by the sugar industry and in the canefields and that we work efficiently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="121"> The most sugar possible must be extracted from every piece of sugarcane that reaches the sugar mill, and this must be done at the lowest possible cost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="122"> The same happens at La Corona tobacco factory we visited the other day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="123"> It was the workers who told us what was happening.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="124"> The workers told us that 750,000 cigars are not being produced because they cannot get the cover leaf, good-quality cover leaf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="125"> The cigars that are produced are for export purposes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="126"> However, one and one half the quality leaf needed for the cover was being used to produce the cigar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="127"> The leaf reached the factory; however, it was not used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="128"> Perhaps it was damaged in the process because it was not treated properly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="129"> [Cruz] It was broken.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="130"> [Ross] It was broken.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="131"> Perhaps the leaf selection process was not properly carried out.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="132"> Perhaps the wrong type of leaf was sent to the section producing another brand of cigar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="133"> Once this occurs, the leaf must be sent back, and in the process, it is damaged or it is never returned to the right place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="134"> Many of these things happen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="135"> Therefore, it is not the same to produce 5.5 million cigars, as the workers did in 1993, as it is to produce 6.250 million cigars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="136"> This is what we are talking about.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="137"> Whatever is up to us to produce more efficiently, we must attempt to do with more efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="138"> That is the heart of the matter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="139"> [Pantoja] There is something you mentioned a little while ago.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="140"> Soledad talked about the need to produce.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="141"> If there is no production, there is no welfare and there are no material goods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="142"> We may have the money, but if there is no production, there is no merchandise; and if there is no merchandise, the people cannot spend the money, and that money stays in the people's pocket.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="143"> [Cruz] We are at a standstill and this situation must be changed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="144"> [Ross] I believe the statements Carlos Lage made yesterday are very important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="145"> They bring us hope; they represent a light for us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="146"> Lage said last night -- I saw him on television and later heard him on the radio -- that there are industries that are beginning to produce.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="147"> Some of these industries began producing a few months ago.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="148"> But he said that there is some reactivation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="149"> Some reactivation, not much, but that we are beginning to see some reactivation of our economy in the industrial sector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="150"> [Pantoja] Tourism for example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="151"> Tourism is a source of income for Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="152"> [Ross] Tourism produces a profit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="153"> That profit will be higher to the extent we increase its efficiency, reduce its costs, and increase its quality as much as possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="154"> That is what it is all about.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="155"> For example, education is a budget sector where we allocate a myriad of resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="156"> We have to try to do a quality job, and we have been working toward that goal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="157"> This process will also analyze this issue: The quality of the education and the maximum use and improvement of educational mechanisms in order to not squander the budget.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="158"> We have to try to eliminate from the budget those expenses which are at times superfluous, are made unnecessary, or are squandered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="159"> [Cruz] There is a question regarding all the information I have heard on radio and television, and it is in connection with a query by a viewer and a listener: If the measures taken are anti-popular, what is the state going to do?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="160"> And I want to comment in this regard: I believe that one of the things we have to attain is to educate everyone on different principles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="161"> I find it frightful how we have developed a mentality of rights, yet speak very little of responsibilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="162"> We do this with almost everything, even with our children and parents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="163"> Children have this and that right given to them by the constitution as a result of their condition as children, and the same is true of youths.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="164"> However, nowhere does it say what the children's responsibilities are to their parents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="165"> This is one example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="166"> The same thing happens with the state and Revolution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="167"> Everyone has a right to education, everyone has a right to health care, everyone has a right, and rights, and rights -- a right to retirement benefits, to work, to receive help, to everything.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="168"> What about responsibilities?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="169"> What are we going to do to fulfill them?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="170"> There are people concerned with anti-popular measures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="171"> We have to see what we define as anti-popular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="172"> When I speak with people on the streets from diverse sectors throughout the land, the people fiercely criticize egalitarism and that the people who do not work have the same rights or more than those who do.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="173"> All this is criticized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="174"> There are many people from generations that experienced capitalism, for example this lady who wrote to us, Ines Pacheco Castillo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="175"> She stressed this in her letter in which she poured out all her opinions on this issue.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="176"> She experienced capitalism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="177"> She said: "We have to understand certain things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="178"> We cannot continue shaping people with every right since birth and yet give them no sense of obligation".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="179"> In this sense, I believe that there are education and health issues which I think are an extremely important accomplishment and should be kept free.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="180"> However, we must also give the citizens, as early in life as possible, a sense of responsibility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="181"> It is incredible how books, which could have been preserved, and windows, and school chairs have been broken.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="183"> I do believe that there should be tax measures to cover when a book, a window, or social property is damaged.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="184"> It is like the state is an open pipe that can provide all these things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="185"> [Ross] I believe that until the collapse of the socialist bloc many thing were provided too generously and that generosity is precisely what provoked our actions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="186"> This is my opinion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="187"> On the other hand, now, having to confront the current problems of the economy, the situation of the economic crisis, all these problems, and even the capitalist crisis, the world economic crisis, this affects us more today because it is undisputable that we have to fend for ourselves; thus we feel these crises more.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="188"> We do not have the support or international aid of yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="189"> Logically, all these things make us do this, change our mind set, think differently about problems, because we are the ones who have to solve the economic problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="190"> [Cruz] What also happens is: We will have to seek ways....[changes thought] I want to know if this has been discussed as this viewer commented: If the measures are anti- popular, what is the state going to do?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="191"> [Ross] What are we all going to do.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="192"> I do not believe that the measures need to be applauded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="193"> They entail an amount of sacrifice but are aimed precisely at protecting the people, at protecting our accomplishments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="194"> I asked this question in Pinar del Rio and repeated it at La Corona: "Do we close the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical Surgical Hospital?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="195"> If we do not solve this, we have to close the hospital.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="196"> Do you want it to close"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="197"> This was followed by everyone's spontaneous protest to the contrary.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="198"> I asked: "Do we close half the schools in Cuba"?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="199"> What is happening in the rest of the continent and the world?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="200"> We have a special situation, have a blockade which makes our situation more difficult.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="201"> [Pantoja] Retirees are conducting a strike in Panama right now.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="202"> [Ross] There are crises in every country, and the solutions being implemented are truly anti-popular because in those countries the rich do not stop being rich.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="203"> On the contrary, the people become poorer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="204"> Here we share the poverty among all of us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="205"> [Cruz] Except the profiteers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="206"> [Ross] Except the profiteers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="207"> Yet, there was a worker at the tobacco factory who told Comrade Alarcon: "You, who represent the state, are required to take drastic measures against the profiteers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="208"> We demand this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="209"> We are going to solve our problems but you have to solve that problem".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="210"> The people, the workers are already demanding this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="211"> A young tobacco worker said there: "Why, I who spend eight hours making tobacco, when I get to the corner just outside the factory, I meet other youths like me selling pullovers and shoes, bartering, and having drinks that are impossible to find anywhere -- exhibiting the result of the profiting, of the theft, of the black market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="212"> [Cruz] This also has to do with something Ines Pacheco said in her letter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="213"> We have to analyze everything in depth because we need to take a package of measures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="214"> We have to attack the problem from many different angles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="215"> [Ross] Yes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="216"> It has to be a package of measures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="217"> We are hearing proposals about diverse measures, but not all measures will be adopted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="218"> [Cruz] Of course.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="219"> [Ross] From that pool of measures we will have, we will adopt the most viable and clever ones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="220"> Fidel said: "The most clever, the least likely to hurt our people".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="221"> Everything we are doing we are doing to solve the dire problems our people confront today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="222"> [Cruz] This comrade in her letter wrote about one of these problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="223"> She said, regarding our commentary last Saturday [15 January] about the lack of service workers in hospital and other places, that someone gets more money by simply selling his quota of rum, coffee, and cigarettes than by working 30 days, and he does this without having to work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="224"> If the profiteer was unable to profit, that person would be forced to get an available job.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="225"> This includes people without a job as well as retirees who want to improve their income.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="226"> [Ross] Thinking such as this teaches us a lot about what needs to be done.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="227"> [Pantoja] Although profiteers are preparing for these measures about the money and are investing in properties, buying this and that.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="228"> [Ross] Properties also can be confiscated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="229"> Properties bought with ill-gotten money can be confiscated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="230"> [Cruz] This is precisely one the questions we received: How can we tell money is properly or improperly obtained?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="231"> Do you also get this question?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="232"> [Pantoja] No.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="233"> There are other questions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="234"> [Ross] Our people know.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="235"> Everyone knows who is who.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="236"> [Cruz] That is right.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="237"> We all know in our block who is who.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="238"> We know who got a car and new clothes overnight and does not have a relative sending dollars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="239"> [Pantoja] I have here a listener: Ruben Jeronimo Rodriguez, 501 25th Street, between H and I in Vedado.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="240"> He proposes, as part of this economic efficiency struggle, an analysis of the possibility of making work center managers a person nominated and elected by that work center's workers, something similar to what is being done in the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="241"> In the UBPC the state bodies make a proposal but if the members disagree they can nominate a UBPC worker, and he becomes the manager.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="242"> In other words, a nomination is presented to the UBPC but if the workers disagree they select another person.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="243"> [Ross] This is the nomination of a member to the UBPC.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="244"> [Pantoja] Ruben Jeronimo Rodriguez proposes that this also be done in the work centers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="245"> [Ross] In the work centers we already have managers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="246"> The workers also have the right to remove a manager who does not make the best use of resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="247"> This is a right all Cuban workers have but we do not exercise it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="248"> This is a matter in which our unions have been lacking, have not acted, have not exercised that right.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="249"> Whether or not to elect them is not what provides the appropriate person.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="250"> There is a selection process for state enterprise managers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="251"> A selection process takes place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="252"> Now if the person does not perform appropriately, the work center always, always [repeats] has the means to challenge this and demand that he be removed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="253"> It is necessary that where the absurdities exist, where there is profiteering and two-handed theft...</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="254"> [changes thought] In a small work center particularly, where theft keeps everyone on the verge of barely making it, everyone knows who the thieves are.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="255"> The manager must be the first to know, and if he is not capable of figuring it out, then he does not deserve to be the manager.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="256"> [Cruz] You have made reference to this many times in the past few days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="257"> There is the question of what role the unions must play in this situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="258"> What is happening?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="259"> We have lived for 35 years in a world where the Revolution is all of us and each of us.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="260"> However, not everyone's functions have been clearly established during this process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="261"> Yet, the society has made progress through diverse means.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="262"> Nowadays, we have a majority of good revolutionary people, but this crisis has also exposed the spiritual poverty of many.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="263"> The difficulties of the people require a precise, appropriate balance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="264"> I believe it is time for the union....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="265"> [changes thought] As you mentioned, where there is a problem, the workers are fully entitled to express themselves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="266"> [Pantoja] I have here a question by Jesus Fernandez Beltran, Consulado Street 111, Havana City.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="267"> He asks: Does the upgrading of an enterprise's category increase the salary of the cadres, but not of the workers?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="268"> Is there any official word on this?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="269"> Can this be done now?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="270"> [Ross] There are certain entities where salary increases for workers and managers have been implemented; particularly, for workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="271"> There was a major salary increase throughout the tourism sector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="272"> In joint enterprises, the personnel rosters have been adjusted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="273"> More is therefore required of the workers in terms of workload, as well as in level of professionalism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="274"> We have stated that as more is demanded of the worker, there must also be a salary response.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="275"> The life of the nation does not stop when confronted with a situation such as this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="276"> While we are correcting things over here, we are also making progress on the other side, where we can.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="277"> We must accelerate progress there where it is needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="278"> I do not know what specific case he is referring to.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="279"> The goal now is to adjust, to free the economy and services from the heavy ballast of bloated personnel rosters, in the production sector as well as in administration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="280"> This cannot be done hastily.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="281"> It must be studied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="282"> We must clearly explain the entire rationalization process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="283"> I answered a question on the Open Agenda program, that this must be accompanied by active union participaton.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="284"> This will always be done with individuals in mind: those staying and those who must relocate, particularly those who must relocate because they are the ones who face the greatest conflict.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="285"> [Cruz] I am concerned by something that I know also worries many people, because I have discussed this with friends and listeners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="286"> I am very afraid that under this premise of protecting the workers and the people, we will continue promoting paternalism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="287"> This worries me a great deal because I already know many cunning people who are saying: "I can bypass that; no problem".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="288"> This worries me because I believe that we have to at least once, in this society, ensure that good things are for those who really work and contribute to society.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="289"> This is why I support helping people rather than subsidizing products and activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="290"> This is why I believe people should be subsidized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="291"> If your income is very low and you have to do certain things, you can be given a special card.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="292"> This is done in all countries of the world, even the capitalist countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="293"> You pay less for transportation and so forth, but the other prices are high.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="294"> There are many who think that because our people are so fine, the Revolution so good, that those who do not work, who do not make an effort to get a job, will continue to live off those who do.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="295"> [Ross] Soledad, it is going to be very difficult to ignore our humanitarian, paternalistic nature.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="296"> What we can do is ensure social justice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="297"> In a TRABAJADORES editorial we said that our commitment is to the good worker, the worker who does his job, the worker who fulfills his social duties.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="298"> We have no commitment to slackers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="299"> I therefore believe that what you say is fair.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="300"> The good workers and the people do not believe that the Revolution will abandon anyone.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="301"> But we must remember that the Revolution is the people, the people who work, the patriotic people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="302"> [Cruz] I have here three questions that have to do with the state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="303"> Perhaps you have questions as well.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="304"> [Pantoja] Similar questions and different questions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="305"> [Cruz] The people have been somewhat shocked by what they heard about the profitability of the enterprises, the budget, the budget deficit, the enterprises that contribute to the deficit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="306"> [Pantoja] Sixty-one percent of the enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="307"> [Cruz] That is correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="308"> The people are demanding that the state set an example, and I believe the people are right in making this demand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="309"> The people have asked the following question: Will the workers be told how much foreign exchange the enterprises use up?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="310"> [Ross] They must be told.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="311"> [Cruz] How does the government plan to save money?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="312"> Has the government decided on the measures to be implemented or is it waiting for the people to express their opinion?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="313"> [Ross] No measures have been drafted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="314"> All possible measures are being studied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="315"> Comrade Fidel said quite rightly that no matter how good a technical measure may be, if it is not understood and supported by the workers, it cannot be implemented.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="316"> On the other hand, the workers themselves are quite capable of coming up with ways to solve the problem, ways that not even the academicians can think of.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="317"> I will give you an example and you will see that it is the same as one of those suggestions you jotted down in your notepad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="318"> At the cigar factory, workers suggested that instead of giving the worker days off for illness, that ten days a year be set aside for sick leave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="319"> [Pantoja] Jose Miguel Quinonez Matos of El Vedado has suggested 10 days a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="320"> [Ross] That is correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="321"> The workers suggested 10 days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="322"> During the days of capitalism, the worker got nine days sick leave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="323"> The tobacco workers have suggested 12 days of sick leave a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="324"> They also suggested that if a worker does not use up his sick leave, he be paid for those days at the end of the year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="325"> That is a suggestion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="326"> I am not saying that it must be implemented, but it does sound interesting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="327"> I do not think the academics had thought about that.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="328"> [Pantoja] This also gives you an idea of how the workers are searching for ways to save, and to put an end to paternalism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="329"> Many of the workers get medical certificates to cover up many of these things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="330"> The health congress discussed....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="331"> [Ross, interrupts] Soledad was just talking about what La Corona workers had suggested.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="332"> If a person gets sick and is going to be out for more than the 10 days, he can take sick leave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="333"> Then he will be covered by social security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="334"> It will be up to the social security people to investigate the worker's economic situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="335"> His family must also be investigated to determine whether they need this help.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="336"> There are families with only one income and there are also families with four, five, six incomes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="337"> There are people who do not have a single centavo in the bank, and there are people who have money in the bank and can cover part of their out-patient expenses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="338"> [Cruz] Of course.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="339"> [Ross] That is what the workers suggested.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="340"> They suggested that a sick-leave system be implemented.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="341"> They suggested even more sick leave days than those given in the past.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="342"> They suggested 12 days of sick leave a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="343"> The citizen who wrote in suggested....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="344"> [Pantoja, interrupts] He suggested 10 days?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="345"> [Ross] He suggested 10 days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="346"> Nothing specific has been decided on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="347"> However, there are some measures that can be implemented at the work centers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="348"> These measures can contribute to improving production, and that is important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="349"> [Cruz] And these measures can be implemented immediately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="350"> [Ross] Yes, they can be implemented immediately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="351"> There are measures to correct the problems we have at the work centers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="352"> There are measures to better use what little resources we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="353"> If there was ever a time when we had to put our resources to best use, it is now when we do not have that much.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="354"> We cannot squander.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="355"> [Cruz] Excuse me, I wish to say something to our listeners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="356"> Our telephone is ringing, but we are having problems when we answer it in the studio; so please call 79-1903.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="357"> I repeat, the telephone line that is working properly is 79-1903.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="358"> [Pantoja] Pedro, from these TRABAJADORES editorials, the two most recent editorials, your statements at the various meetings, what I have heard some provincial union leaders say on the radio, I gather that the labor union's supervisory role must be expanded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="359"> The labor union must confront these problems at the work centers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="360"> The labor union must be given more power, or stress the power it has always had and have the union leaders use it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="361"> [Ross] The labor union must use the power it has.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="362"> The workers must use the power they have to help the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="363"> [Pantoja] Yes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="364"> [Ross] To help the country and to help themselves, which is the same thing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="365"> The interests of the workers and our people are at stake.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="366"> Socialism is at stake.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="367"> The social progress we have made throughout the past 35 years are at stake.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="368"> We must defend this and we must defend this with what we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="369"> [Cruz] I think this experience is very important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="370"> It is not the first time something like this is being done.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="371"> For many years whenever an important congress was held, whenever a change to the Constitution was made it was always discussed with the rank and file, with the people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="372"> However, I do believe that the union and the workers should work hard to ensure that the idea of a parliament at the work place is not lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="373"> The workers must always feel that they have the right to ask and demand explanations of what the administration is doing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="374"> This right must not be lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="375"> We have returned to what I consider has been the backbone of the Cuban revolutionary process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="376"> We have returned to the days of direct participation of the workers in the decision making process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="377"> [Ross] The workers are the owners of these enterprises, and as owners they must take action.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="378"> Yesterday in Pinar del Rio a comrade asked: What will happen once all this is over?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="379"> This is not going to end.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="380"> This will continue.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="381"> This is not a campaign.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="382"> We are gathering ideas, suggestions, proposals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="383"> We are talking and explaining, and the people are understanding the situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="384"> However, efficiency is not something you will achieve from one day to another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="385"> Efficiency is not something that will be achieved after a meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="386"> We must continue to work at each work center.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="387"> We have production and service meetings that should be used to discuss efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="388"> This would be very helpful for the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="389"> We would help the country by analyzing economic efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="392"> [Ross, interrupts] Efficiency is the services that are offered, any kind of service offered by the labor groups.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="393"> This can be discussed on a monthly basis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="394"> The workers would have an active role at these meetings; they would not be passive listeners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="395"> The union leaders are responsible for promoting the active role of the worker.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="396"> [Pantoja] The worker lost interest in the production assemblies; the idea behind these assemblies was lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="397"> The administrations took an offensive stance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="398"> The administrators were the ones drafting the reports and presiding over the assemblies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="399"> The union stepped aside.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="400"> [Ross] Those are reports that say nothing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="401"> [Pantoja] Totally technical reports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="402"> [Ross] A report is not numbers alone.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="403"> A report must also be a means to evaluate a situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="404"> Where is the problem?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="405"> Why this much, and not more?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="406"> [Pantoja] Pedro, what has happened is that technical words are used to describe technical problems, and we do not have the knowledge of the technical aspects of the work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="407"> We know nothing of productivity, costs, profitability.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="408"> Now we must learn all these things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="409"> [Ross] Because of the special period we cannot evade our responsibility in discussing these issues.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="410"> The special period forces us to confront that discussion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="411"> [Cruz] There is another problem we must broach.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="412"> The people are discouraged when they cannot participate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="413"> This is why the production and service meetings lost their value.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="414"> The workers felt that they did not have the right to be heard, to demand that he be heard.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="415"> [Pantoja] The problem was that issues were discussed month after month and no one did anything to improve the situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="416"> [Ross] You are correct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="417"> [Pantoja] People get tired after a while.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="418"> [Ross] We now have the UBPC.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="419"> The members of the UBPC are the ones who make the decisions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="420"> Whatever they say is law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="422"> [Pantoja] I have more questions from our listeners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="423"> Ana Maria Mendoza Verdor, from San Miguel del Padron, wants to know: There is talk that there will be wage cuts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="424"> Will the wages of the manager or director of an unprofitable enterprise be cut as well?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="425"> [Ross] We do not have to lower the salary of a manager or director who is not capable of making his enterprise profitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="426"> What we have to do is find a new manager.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="427"> The solution is not to cut his wages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="428"> We have to demand efficiency from our managers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="429"> The manager must work efficiently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="430"> They are getting paid for that and it is their responsibility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="431"> [Cruz] I have a caller on the line.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="432"> [Unidentified caller] Good morning.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="433"> I am from Nuevitas Municipality, Camaguey Province.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="434"> I work at the CATM [expansion unknown] at Nuevitas port.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="435"> I am a coordinator with 28 years of service and am 52 years old.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="436"> I would like Pedro Ross to answer a question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="437"> If there were a reduction here at the port and I was affected, what would happen to me if, because of my age and years of service, there is no other job for me? I would like to know what will happen to people like me?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="438"> Right? [Ross] You are about ready to retire.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="439"> It has been said that all those workers who are nearing retirement age, who are efficient workers, and who have a good work record, will be given special consideration if this should occur.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="440"> However, you are calling me from Camaguey.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="441"> Camaguey is an area where manpower is needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="442"> We need more workers at the power company in Nuevitas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="443"> We need more workers at that important power company.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="444"> Changes have been made at the Nuevitas Port.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="445"> I do not know what kind of a payroll they have there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="446"> You are working in an area that does not merit cuts; it is in those areas where we need more manpower.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="447"> Once our economy improves we will have more work at the ports, and Nuevitas is one of the most important ports in the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="448"> You told me that you work for the CATM.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="449"> You are responsible for controlling and distributing the merchandise that comes into the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="450"> We would have to study the situation there, but I can tell you and we have decided that those workers who are nearing retirement age must be respected and will have priority as far as remaining in their jobs is concerned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="451"> [Cruz] Reina Cintras Portal from Sancti Spiritus also had a question regarding retirement: Are there any plans for the graduating youths and current labor or labor training problems, and are there plans to reduce the age for retirement?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="452"> [Ross] This is something that has existed for a long time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="453"> [Cruz] This has been around for a while.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="454"> [Ross] Since we began to prepare for the 16th [CTC] Congress, this issue was discussed intensely, even in sectors such as education.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="455"> In the next 25 years Cuba will see a drop in the growth of the active labor force due to birth rates, the demographic process we face in the next 25 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="456"> In countries were life expectancy is being extended and people over 60 are physically strong and useful, active labor time is extended because that worker is an important resource for the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="457"> We, Cuba, cannot adopt a measure in this regard on the basis of the situation we are trying to overcome.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="458"> This is temporary.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="459"> The less it lasts the better.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="460"> We are going to need that work force.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="461"> It is possible that in the future we might have to raise the retirement age, as is done in the developed countries where life expectancy is long.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="462"> We have 1.1 million retirees in Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="463"> Cuba paid 1.6 billion in social security in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="464"> In other words, a fourth of what is paid in salaries in Cuba is paid through...</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="465"> [Pantoja interrupting] How much was paid?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="466"> [Ross] 1.6 billion in retirement benefits and social programs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="467"> [Cruz] This is an impressive figure for a country like ours and the problems we have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="468"> We have about five minutes left.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="469"> I want to remind all that on 17 January there is going to be meeting of the union cadres in the CTC provincial school; on 18 January, there is going to be a meeting of union cadres at 1500 in the Martinez Prieto Agroindustrial Complex; on 19 January in Havana at 0900 and 1600 in a merchant fleet vessel; on 20 January, the Cuban delegation to Latin American and Caribbean events will meet with Ariguanabo union cadres at 1300.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="470"> The Havana UBPC will meet at 0900 on 24 January in the Finlay Institute; on 25 January, there will be a meeting of the CTC Secretariat with union cadres of Havana port.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="473"> There are activities, discussions, debates scheduled for the rest of the month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="474"> I believe it has been quite a while since the workers have been so excited, because we know we are deciding the future of the nation, which is our own future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="475"> I believe there is a caller.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="476"> Let us listen to her.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="477"> [Caller] My name is Mella Costa Vera, a worker in Boca Ciega Workers tourist village.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="478"> In the previous program, Soledad Cruz proposed discussing today the issue of incentives for workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="479"> Since it was not possible to discuss this issue due to the importance of all the issues discussed in the last two programs, I would like to propose that Comrade Pedro Ross check his agenda and see if he can participate in this program next Saturday [22 January] to continue discussing these issues due to their importance for the country and the value of his explanations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="480"> This would clarify all the doubts we workers have when it comes time to make proposals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="481"> That is all I wanted to suggest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="482"> [Ross] Well, since this program is early in the morning I can come.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="483"> [Cruz] I am truly glad about this caller's suggestion because there are many things to discuss and calls.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="484"> We have a call from Eulalia Ginarche Miranda from Baguanos Municipality in Holguin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="485"> There are other questions by Reina [words indistinct].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="486"> There are other aspects to discuss of the letter from Ines Pacheco.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="488"> [Cruz] There are issues such as personnel rosters which highly worry the workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="489"> Will retirees and non-union workers, as well as housewives, get a chance to give their opinions?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="490"> This is another interesting issue.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="491"> There are many complaints from retirees that the country is not counting them, their experience, or help.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-51398" num="492"> I have many complaints from retirees.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="9"> Deukmejian Administration budget proposals to spend $625 million in new tobacco tax revenues for health and other programs came under fire Wednesday from both the tobacco industry and proponents of Proposition 99, the anti-smoking initiative.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="10"> Tobacco industry spokesmen, during a hearing of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, said it is a mistake for Gov. George Deukmejian to count on raising $625 million because of a legal challenge to Proposition 99's required increase in taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="11"> The industry representatives also said the Proposition 99 tax rate of 41.67% on the wholesale price of cigarettes is so high that the Administration's expected windfall will never develop because smokers will smoke less and be encouraged to buy their tobacco products from mail-order firms in states that do not have the tax.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="12"> Supporters of Proposition 99 attacked the Administration for proposing to use the new revenues to fund a variety of programs that are now financed from general tax revenues.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="13"> They argued that the governor's budget proposals violate a provision of Proposition 99 prohibiting use of the money "to supplant existing levels of service".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="14"> Deukmejian Administration officials insisted that their revenue projections as well as their reading of Proposition 99 are appropriate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="15"> Lonnie Mathis, chief of financial research for the Department of Finance, said the Administration expects only a 2% reduction in smoking as a result of higher prices.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="16"> That expectation, he said, is based on a belief that people who smoke today are "hard-core smokers" who do not plan to quit no matter what the price.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="17"> "We don't think a penny a cigarette is going to have a real significant impact on those people," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="22"> Kopp (I-San Francisco), said he also thinks the Administration is trying to misuse Proposition 99 funds and asked for a formal legal opinion from the Legislature's chief lawyer.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="25"> The dispute over whether Deukmejian is proposing to use Proposition 99 money to finance continuing state programs centers chiefly on a new plan to finance health services for poor Californians with $331.3 million in cigarette tax money.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="26"> Deukmejian is also proposing to trim $358 million from a health program for the same patient group that is financed with general tax revenues.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="27"> Garamendi told John Ramey, deputy secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency, that he thinks the Administration "eliminated the old program and started a new one and substituted the source of funds using the cigarette tax.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="28"> I think that is illegal".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="29"> Ramey said, "We don't believe that we are asking the Legislature to do something that is illegal".</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="30"> Dr. James Nethery, a dentist and chairman of Coalition for a Healthy California, sponsors of Proposition 99, accused the Administration of playing "a shell game".</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="31"> "The wording of the initiative is very clear.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="32"> The funds are not to be used to replace existing programs, and there is no question in my mind that is exactly what is happening in this case," Nethery said.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="33"> He said that the coalition would file a suit to block the spending proposal if the Legislature accepts the governor's plan.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="34"> Opponents of Proposition 99, during their turn before the committee, said they have already filed suit on the grounds that they believe the tax increase is illegal because it was not approved by the Legislature.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="36"> Doerr, a tax specialist for the California Taxpayers Assn., told committee members not to count on seeing the money because it is possible that the courts will rule in the tobacco industry's favor.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="37"> Doerr said the California Constitution prohibits voters from raising taxes in any way other than through a constitutional amendment.</s>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="38"> Proposition 99 raised the tax by changing a statute in the tax law.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="39"> Department of Finance officials estimate that most of the revenue from Proposition 99, $595 million, will come from the tax increase on cigarettes and that about $30 million will come from sales of cigars, pipe tobacco and other tobacco products.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020289-0058" num="40"> Norman Sharp, a spokesman for the Cigar Assn. of America and the Pipe Tobacco Council, predicted that "the $30 million will never materialize" because smokers will either quit or buy tobacco products by mail order.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="9"> Long Beach health officials are exploring ways of spending the city's share of tobacco tax money -- $1 million -- in an ambitious statewide effort to cut cigarette smoking by 75% by 1999.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="10"> A coalition of more than two dozen local experts will meet for the first time next week to discuss strategies for the new tax money approved by voters more than a year ago, the first ever allocated for education to stop an addiction blamed for nearly one-third of the nation's cancer deaths.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="11"> The money is the product of Proposition 99, which raised the tax on cigarettes 25 cents a pack and imposed similar increases on pipe, cigar and other tobacco products.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="12"> The tax generated $1.5 billion statewide, and just more than $1 million of it has trickled down to the Health Department and school district in Long Beach -- a city with a sizable population of minorities and children considered at "high risk" of tobacco addiction.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="13"> Local health experts say they have their work cut out for them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="14"> "This is a very large community and it is a very diverse community with lots of populations at risk for using tobacco products," said Alan Henderson, chairman of the health sciences department at Cal State Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="15"> "This is money earmarked for education that has not been here before, and a lot can be done with that amount of money for the benefit of the people in Long Beach".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="16"> But officials concede that the local money pales next to the $2.5 billion the tobacco industry spends on national advertising yearly, much of it, they say, aimed at minorities and adolescents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="17"> A recent cigarette called Uptown was pulled off the market by its manufacturers after health advocates decried a marketing campaign that clearly targeted blacks, who suffer one of the highest lung cancer death rates in the country, cancer experts report.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="18"> And health officials have long complained that cigarette packaging and ad images are seductive to children, 70% of whom will try tobacco at some point, researchers say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="19"> "Considering the dramatic need for education, this is not a lot of money -- a drop in the bucket -- and it is very important that it be spent wisely by someone who can deliver," said Jayne Lastusky, executive director of the American Cancer Society's Long Beach unit and a coalition member.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="20"> The coalition also will include representatives from the American Heart Assn., area hospitals, public schools and Cal State Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="21"> It will monitor the spending of $632,000 administered by the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services and $408,000 by the Long Beach Unified School District.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="22"> Most cities in Los Angeles County are served by the county's massive health department.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="23"> Because Long Beach is one of only three communities that operates its own health agency, it has the unique opportunity to fight tobacco on the local level.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="24"> Henderson said it is vital that education go "beyond pamphlets".</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="25"> The coalition will attempt to define the tobacco problem in Long Beach, determine how to stop those who have started and educate those who have not.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="26"> Experts hope to see the money used to enhance programs like Smoke-Free 2000, aimed at educating first-graders to ensure that they will be nonsmokers when they enter high school.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="27"> Another concept is a hot line with information about stop-smoking programs for schools, industries and individuals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="28"> The funds became available in January and the health department hired consultant Judy Ross to direct the tobacco control program last month.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="29"> Already, though, there is concern that Long Beach has fallen behind schedule.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="30"> While the coalition approaches its first meeting Wednesday, the state is already preparing to launch an anti-tobacco media blitz April 11.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="31"> Competition will be stiff for millions more dollars available to agencies by request, and Long Beach could miss out if its plans are not firmed up soon, Henderson said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="32"> "I am concerned Long Beach is behind," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="33"> "This is more money than has been seen in a long, long time for health educators.</s>

<s docid="LA032990-0136" num="34"> And there is a lot of excitement among people in health education who have been toiling in the vineyards without any resources for so long".</s>
