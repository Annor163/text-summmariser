<s docid="FT921-16023" num="7"> RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group, announced yesterday that it plans to build a factory in Turkey to produce cigarettes by late 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="8"> The North Carolina company says the plant will have an eventual production capacity of 10bn cigarettes a year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="9"> The 135,000 sq ft plant will be sited in the Izmir region.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="10"> The company said that it had earmarked more than Dollars 100m for investment in Turkey over the next decade.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="11"> Turkey is a big market for cigarettes, and consumption is estimated at 80bn a year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="12"> However, it is still dominated by Tekel, the state-owned monopoly.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="13"> The market was only opened to foreign cigarettes in the mid-1980s, but western products have taken an increasing market share.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="14"> Philip Morris, RJR's big US competitor and manufacturer of Marlboro, has been successful.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="15"> RJR, however, said that it saw opportunities for its three brands - Camel, Winston, and Salem.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="16"> It expects to employ 300 people initially at the factory, but said employment could eventually total about 800.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16023" num="17"> Mr Dale Sisel, head of RJ Reynolds Tobacco International, said: 'It's a large market, with significant demand for American-blend cigarettes, and there's plenty of opportunity for us to become a major participant.'</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="7"> DONSKOI Tabak, the Russian cigarette plant at Rostov, is being wooed by the west's tobacco multinationals.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="8"> The Interfax news agency reported earlier this week that BAT will 'take part in a competition for the right to buy shares' in the plant, probably later this month.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="9"> Interfax quotes Donskoi Tabak's general director, Mr Yevgeny Balala, as saying that 'several Swiss and American companies' have now expressed interest in the 4.5m cigarette-a-day plant.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="10"> BAT would not confirm the story, but did confirm that the three tobacco majors - BAT, RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris - are 'head to head in investment terms' in the former Soviet Union.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="11"> It is a potential bonanza: a market estimated at between 400 - 700bn cigarettes a year and an unsatisfied craving for American tobacco has meant that they, even more avidly than the energy companies and with greater success so far, are scrambling to position themselves for future market growth.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="12"> Furthermore, the Russian government's move to large-scale privatisation at the end of last year - expected to be greatly extended later this month - means that the foreign companies have a new way of buying in, other than concluding joint ventures.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="13"> They can now bid for shares in the company at open auctions in competition with Russians - a method which, according to Interfax, BAT has already discussed with the Donskoi management at meetings last month.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="14"> Of the three, Philip Morris, with its Marlboro brand, is the best known.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="15"> It came in on the ground floor in Russia in 1990 (it had small production agreements before) with the request by the then Soviet government to import 20bn cigarettes immediately to satisfy a cigarette famine which caused more riots in that year than any other event.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="16"> Philip Morris had built on that entree and now has firm projects which include a stake in a joint venture called Constellation in Samara involving the city's main tobacco factory, where Marlboro will be produced under licence.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="17"> It also has a prospective stake in the cigarette plant in Krasnodar, which is about to be privatised.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="18"> This has a capacity of 6bn cigarettes a year and will produce Marlboro and other Philip Morris and local brands; and an agreement to construct a 10bn-cigarettes-a-year capacity plant near St Petersburg, also for Marlboro.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="19"> The company says it has no overall figure for investment, but says that the cost of the St Petersburg plant in the west would be around Dollars 100m (Pounds 64.7m).</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="20"> 'We are in for the long term,' says Philip Morris's Michael Parsons, 'and the investment will be significant'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="21"> BAT has been the later runner of the big three: but towards the end of last year, it signed a joint venture in Ukraine, with two plants at Priluki and Cherkassy, both south of Kiev, and is in an advanced stage of negotiations with the Java plant in Moscow.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="22"> Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said in Moscow in November that 'the investments we are making are essentially long term.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="23">. . we do not expect to be making profits for at least 10 years'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="24"> RJ Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, last year acquired a controlling stake in the largest cigarette plant in St Petersburg, AS Petro - now renamed RJR-Petro.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="25"> The plant produces some 22bn cigarettes year - all local brands - the RJR brand leader, Camel, nor any of its other brands, is not produced - allowing it to claim the biggest output of the big three in Russia.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="26"> It also claims to dominate Ukraine, with majority stakes in plants in Lvov and Kremenchug, with a combined capacity of around 20bn cigarettes a year - again, all local brands.</s>

<s docid="FT931-16417" num="27"> This gives RJR around 25 per cent of the Ukraine cigarette market .</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="5"> By RICHARD TOMKINS</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="6"> You've heard of no smoking offices, no smoking flights, no smoking zones and no smoking days.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="7"> Now meet the no smoking country - or something well on the way to it.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="8"> Smokers in the US, and the cigarette makers they keep in business, have never had it so bad.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="9"> After two decades of relatively ineffectual opposition from anti-smoking activists, they face an unprecedented outbreak of hostility from politicians, government officials, business and the public.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="10"> In many settings, the expression 'Mind if I smoke'? now prompts the sort of reaction that might once have been reserved for the suggestion: 'Mind if I slay'?</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="11"> So reviled has the habit become that, if legislators and their supporters succeed in their aims, smoking will be regarded as behaviour to be indulged in furtively, if at all, in the privacy of the home, car, or a special smoking chamber.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="12"> One example of the pressure is a bill before Congress that would ban smoking in all buildings regularly entered by 10 or more people a week, except the home.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="13"> In effect, this would embrace all factories, offices, bars, restaurants and night clubs - though specially designated smoking rooms would be permitted if they were sealed off from the rest of the premises and had separate outdoor ventilation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="14"> That bill, sponsored by the anti-smoking Congressman Henry Waxman and backed by the Clinton administration, is expected to go to a vote in a congressional sub-committee in the next few days.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="15"> Conceivably, it may fail.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="16"> But it is only slightly more restrictive than other measures under consideration or already coming into force.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="17"> The US labour department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is seeking a federal ban on smoking in the workplace.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="18"> Since bars, restaurants and other places of entertainment are also places of work, they would be included - though, as under the Waxman bill, sealed-off smoking rooms would be allowed.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="19"> The Food and Drug Administration, another federal agency, has claimed it has evidence that the tobacco industry is adding nicotine to cigarettes to keep smokers addicted.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="20"> It has asked Congress to rule whether it should start controlling the sale of cigarettes as a drug or, alternatively, whether nicotine in cigarettes should be banned.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="21"> The US defence department has banned smoking in all military workplaces, ranging from military bases to tanks and battleships.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="22"> The Clinton administration has also banned smoking in school buildings and health centres.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="23"> Hundreds of ordinances have been passed by states, cities or local communities banning smoking in public areas.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="24"> San Francisco, San Jose and other Californian cities have banned smoking in nearly all indoor spaces except private houses.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="25"> New York's city council has unveiled plans to toughen up existing restrictions on smoking in bars, restaurants and workplaces and to extend them to outdoor areas such as parks, playgrounds and sports stadiums.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="26"> McDonald's, the fast-food company, has followed examples set by the Taco Bell and Jack in the Box chains by banning smoking in all 1,400 of its company-owned (as opposed to franchised) restaurants in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="27"> Many stores, shopping malls and sports stadiums are already smoke-free.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="28"> President Bill Clinton has proposed a 75-cent-per-packet increase in the excise tax on 20 cigarettes to 99 cents per packet to help pay for reform of the US healthcare system.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="29"> Even this is not enough for some legislators, who are pushing for a tax increase of up to Dollars 2 per packet.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="30"> These developments contrast sharply with earlier history of anti-smoking activity in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="31"> Although 30 years have passed since the US surgeon general, the country's chief medical officer, concluded that smoking could cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases, until recently the anti-smoking lobby had found itself outgunned by the tobacco industry.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="32"> In Congress, cigarette makers could automatically be assured of support from representatives of the tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="33"> But that was only part of the story.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="34"> Because of the millions of dollars the tobacco industry spent on lobbying and contributions to lawmakers' election campaigns, its political influence extended much further.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="35"> As a result, the US tobacco industry largely escaped stringent anti-smoking measures.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="36"> Although health warnings started to appear on cigarette packets in 1966 and cigarette advertising was banned on radio and television in 1969, almost the only federally imposed restriction on smoking was the ban applying to domestic flights lasting fewer than six hours, introduced in 1990; and the federal excise tax, though increased several times, is still only 24 cents a packet.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="37"> At the beginning of last year, however, two things happened that changed the climate.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="38"> One was a report from the US Environmental Protection Agency that classified tobacco smoke as a class-A carcinogen and blamed passive smoking for an estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="39"> The other was a declaration from the Clintons on Inauguration Day that the White House was to be a smoke-free zone.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="40"> The Environmental Protection Agency report has had far-reaching effects in the US because it has enabled non-smokers to claim that cigarette smoke is not just an irritation, but a menace to their health.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="41"> It is largely on the back of this report and later ones giving more weight to it, that the US has seen a wave of anti-smoking ordinances aimed at safeguarding the health of non-smokers in public places.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="42"> Meanwhile, the Clintons' anti-smoking stance has undermined the political influence of the tobacco industry, shifting the balance of power in favour of anti-smoking activists.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="43"> Could it be curtains, then, for Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, American Tobacco and the other US cigarette makers?</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="44"> Certainly, they are on the defensive.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="45"> Such is the abuse being heaped on the tobacco industry, and so great the obstacles being thrown in its path, that it is tempting to ask why its executives do not simply give up and try something else.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="46"> One reason they have not is that, though the US market may be turning ugly, new markets for cigarette exports are opening up worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="47"> For example, Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco ship more than 10bn cigarettes a year to the former Soviet Union, adding Dollars 100m a year to sales.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="48"> The total market in the former eastern bloc countries is estimated at about 700bn cigarettes a year, far exceeding the 485bn consumed last year in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="49"> The cigarette makers, wary of accusations that they are exploiting ignorance of smoking-related health risks in less developed countries, play down the export opportunities, saying that profit margins on overseas sales are lower than on domestic sales.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="50"> In any event, prospects in the US may not be quite as bad as they seem.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="51"> For one thing, cigarette manufacturers still derive big profits from the US market: Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco alone made operating profits totalling Dollars 4bn from domestic tobacco sales of Dollars 15bn last year, even during a vicious price war.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="52"> As long as that kind of money is available, the industry will fight to the last to defend its market.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="53"> Last month, for example, Philip Morris filed a Dollars 10bn lawsuit against the ABC television network for broadcasting a programme claiming that the company added nicotine to its cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="54"> There must also be doubts about how quickly the government could move towards total prohibition, if it developed the will to do so.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="55"> Apart from the political considerations, a sudden collapse in the Dollars 43bn a year spent on cigarettes in the US would leave a big hole in the economy; and a cut in the Dollars 16.5bn a year collected in tax revenue could be even more awkward, especially at a time when government is looking for funding for healthcare reform.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="56"> Meanwhile, although total cigarette consumption continues to fall in the US, there are signs that the proportion of people who smoke has bottomed out at about 25 per cent, and may even be rising again among the youth, women and ethnic minorities.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="57"> Moreover, according to Ms Faith Popcorn, a New York marketing consultant, some middle-class adults are sick of healthy living and have started lighting up in a rebellion against political correctness - a trend she calls 'pleasure revenge'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="58"> Smokers, it seems, have little to look forward to but vilification.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="59"> They will also find it harder to find an appropriate or convenient place to indulge their habit.</s>

<s docid="FT942-14179" num="60"> But neither they, nor the tobacco industry, believe they have quite had their last gasp - at least, that is, not yet.</s>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="10"> With help from the Marlboro Man, an enormous advertising budget and growing demand overseas, the No. 1 cigarette maker is selling more smokes than ever despite a shrinking market at home.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="11"> In many respects, the success of Philip Morris USA reflects the scrappy tenacity of the domestic tobacco industry, which has taken an aggressive -- some critics would say hostile and unethical -- approach to selling cigarettes and combating health groups that want to restrict smoking.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="12"> "There are 55 to 60 million adults in this country who have made the choice to smoke," said Steve Weiss, a Philip Morris spokesman.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="14"> Philip Morris hasn't been immune to the growing anti-smoking movement in the United States, which has played a role in reducing the market by about 2 percent a year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="15"> That shrinkage is partly why Philip Morris USA's New York-based parent, Philip Morris Cos., acquired Kraft Inc. and Miller Brewing Co. years ago -- to protect itself by diversifying.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="16"> Nonetheless, the tobacco arm of the conglomerate has been strengthening relative to competitors, with weapons that range from intense advertising to lobbying in Washington to a sales assault on virgin territory abroad.</s>

<s docid="LA021890-0196" num="18"> Philip Morris held almost 42 percent of the U.S. cigarette market last year, said John Maxwell Jr., who follows the industry for Wheat First Securities in Richmond.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="8"> The deal with the regional administration is to set up a factory near the town of Vyborg, employing at least 600 workers and costing 'several dozen' million dollars.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="9"> It follows a similar agreement reached by RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and foods group, to produce other well-known western brands in the same part of Russia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="10"> The Philip Morris target is to produce 10bn cigarettes a year at the factory, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="11"> Yesterday's announcement in St Petersburg was preceded by a marketing campaign in Russia's second city, with kiosks selling Marlboro at less than the price charged by new private Russian businesses and glossy adverts appearing in the local subway.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="12"> On Tuesday, Philip Morris executives met Russian government officials to discuss ways in which Russia might repay a debt of Dollars 98.7m worth of cigarettes delivered in 1991 after Moscow was hit by 'tobacco riots' as a result of a domestic shortages.</s>

<s docid="FT923-4661" num="13"> Strapped for hard currency, Russia has offered to repay the debt with a combination of raw materials, real estate and roubles.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="7"> Philip Morris has agreed to take a majority stake in Alma-Aty Tobacco Kombinat, a cigarette manufacturer in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, according to Interfax, the Russian news agency.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="8"> The Dollars 310m investment in the operation, in which the US group already owns a 49 per cent interest, underlines the importance of international markets to the troubled US food and tobacco group.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="10"> The investment includes Dollars 48.9m to acquire the equity, a Dollars 50m bonus to be paid to the Kazakh government, and about Dollars 210m in spending to improve production, tobacco growing and processing.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="11"> In September, Philip Morris agreed to buy a minority interest in the enterprise and said it would lift its stake to more than 90 per cent within a year.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="12"> The deal represented the first in which a foreign company had taken a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet republic.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="13"> The Kazakh acquisition is the latest in a series of moves in which Philip Morris has sought to bolster its presence in foreign markets, which account for a greater percentage of its tobacco revenues than the US.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="15"> Along with other US tobacco groups, Philip Morris's domestic revenues have been hit by declining cigarette consumption.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="16"> Profits from foreign sales, meanwhile, have grown at a faster pace than domestic earnings, partly because of the increasing popularity of cut-price no-frills brands.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17680" num="18"> As part of the agreement, ATK will manufacture Marlboro and other leading Philip Morris brands, as well as local cigarettes.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="7"> RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group, warned yesterday that profits this year from its domestic cigarette business - which accounts for more than half of group operating profits - would be hit by the looming cigarette price-war in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="8"> Additional marketing and promotional investments would have a negative effect on full-year 1993 results, 'although it is still too early to determine the degree of impact', the group said.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="9"> The price war began when Philip Morris, RJR's US rival, said it would cut the price of its flagship Marlboro brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="10"> Earlier this week, RJR revealed plans to match this cut on its Winston brand - its leading full-priced brand, and the one that competes most closely with Marlboro - with some other promotional activity applied to its Camel brand.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="11"> RJR's cuts would apply in June, and be reviewed at the end of that month.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="12"> The company has already amended a 'targeted stock scheme' - designed to create two separate classes of stock pegged to the tobacco and food divisions respectively - because of the uncertainty hanging over its tobacco division's profitability.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="13"> The warning came as RJR announced first-quarter profits of Dollars 163m after tax, compared with a loss of Dollars 15m in the same period of 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="14"> Most of the advance was due to lower interest costs, however, and operating income increased only marginally from Dollars 664m to Dollars 683m.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="15"> The domestic tobacco division saw slightly lower profits at Dollars 500m (Dollars 512m), while international operations advanced from Dollars 139m To Dollars 159m.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="16"> The fall in domestic tobacco profits reflected higher unit volume - up 9 per cent - but more sales coming from less profitable 'discount' brands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="17"> On the food side, RJR saw operating profits increase from Dollars 189m to Dollars 203m, on sales up from Dollars 1.54bn to Dollars 1.63bn.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="18"> Group sales in the first quarter were Dollars 3.74bn, compared with Dollars 3.64bn in the same period of 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="19"> Mr Michael Miles, chairman of Philip Morris, told the group's annual meeting yesterday that if the 40 cents a packet price cut was not enough to regain the ground that full-priced brands have lost to discount cigarettes, 'we are prepared to go beyond that if we have to protect our brand franchise'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-11887" num="20"> However, he was upbeat about long-term prospects, and indicated that a dividend increase might be forthcoming in August.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="7"> Tabacalera, the Spanish tobacco group, said it was actively looking at several overseas markets to identify expansion opportunities, Reuter reports from Madrid.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="8"> 'We are looking at the fastest growing markets which would be the most interesting for us,' said Mr Calixto Rios, financial director, announcing a 104 per cent improvement in group nine-month pre-tax profits.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="9"> It set up a joint venture this year with ZPT Radom in Poland, where it produces its new Winns brand.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="10"> Cigarette consumption in Spain is falling by 0.7-1.0 per cent a year, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="11"> Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, however, offer potential for growth.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="12"> The group's nine-month pre-tax profits rose to Pta13.05bn (Dollars 106m) from Pta6.4bn in the same period last year, as sales of premium brands rose due to a crackdown on smuggling.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="13"> Costs fell as a result of lay-offs.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="14"> Group net sales rose to Pta535.77bn from Pta456.3bn.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="15"> Sales of the top of the range Philip Morris and Reynolds brands, such as Marlboro and Winston, which Tabacalera makes under licence, were particularly buoyant.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="16"> These are the types most popular with smugglers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="17"> 'The results have evolved very much in line with expectations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="18"> We hope the final quarter will be similar and we are sticking to our original forecasts,' Mr Rios said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-9537" num="19"> The company expects to cut the workforce by 750 people, or nearly 9 per cent, by the end of the year.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="6"> Growth prospects are now opening for international cigarette companies that would have been regarded as a pipe-dream a decade ago.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="7"> Political change in eastern Europe and the removal of trade barriers in the Far East have given the four multinationals - Philip Morris, BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and Rothmans International - access to big potential new markets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="8"> Ten years ago, the world market amounted to 4,500bn cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="9"> But more than 60 per cent of that was virtually closed to the multinationals by communist and non-communist state monopolies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="10"> Today, world consumption of cigarettes is 20 per cent greater at 5,400bn; and western tobacco companies are barred from less than 5 per cent of it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="11"> Sir Pat Sheehy, chairman of BAT, says the prospects for international companies are better than at any time during his 40 years in the industry.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="12"> The group's exports have risen from 45bn cigarettes in 1986 to 86bn in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="13"> Philip Morris, the tobacco exports of which already contribute Dollars 3bn to the US balance of payments, says: 'The potential for our business overseas is phenomenal'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="14"> The group plans a Dollars 3bn investment programme over the next five years to increase its worldwide production capacity to cope with the expected demand.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="15"> The surface of the liberalised markets has as yet only been scratched.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="16"> The scope for growth can be measured from the fact that BAT supplied 10.3 per cent of the total world market in 1990, but a mere 1 per cent of the communist and former communist market, which accounted for 2,460bn cigarettes, and only 2.9 per cent of the 1,050bn cigarettes consumed in other countries with tobacco monopolies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="17"> The multinationals have continued to extract profitable growth from established markets in the US and much of western Europe in spite of a decline in consumption under the constant and growing pressure of health lobbies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="18"> But they are now brimming with confidence about the outlook for profits well beyond the next decade.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="19"> In most of the newly opened markets, smoking is still on the increase; and consumers are showing a strong preference for the multinationals' products.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="20"> Worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's ubiquitous Marlboro, have grown by 7 per cent a year over the past three years, and they are gaining market share almost everywhere from national brands in western European countries such as France, Italy and Spain where state monopolies have previously dominated.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="21"> new markets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="22"> The multinationals' salesmen are advancing in force into eastern Europe where the demise of communism has opened a potential market for 700bn cigarettes - eight times bigger than the UK's.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="23"> Economic problems, political uncertainties, and poor service facilities may slow the profitable exploitation of opportunities.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="24"> Mr Charles Pick, tobacco industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute, says: 'The market is characterised by a lack of hard currency, modern technology and competition'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="25"> Initial operations have encountered frustrating day-to-day difficulties with inadequate banking and telephone systems, and a chronic shortage of hotel accommodation and trained personnel.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="26"> BAT's advance guard in east Germany, for instance, lived for a time in caravans and sent messages by taxi.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="27"> The lack of clearly defined lines of responsibility between central and local government authorities in the republics also makes negotiation long and difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="28"> But the longer-term potential is worth serious investment.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="29"> Mr Philippe Grandjean, spokesman for Philip Morris's operations in eastern Europe, says: 'We have to make a firm commitment; show that we intend to be a permanent partner in the new systems being established in these countries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="30"> We do not expect immediate returns.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="31"> We are building a solid base for the future'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="32"> Cigarette production in Russia this year is expected to fall about 150bn cigarettes short of demand.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="33"> Philip Morris recently signed a contract to supply 11bn, and will start producing Marlboros in Russia this year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="34"> It supplied the republic with 22bn cigarettes last year - and says it was paid promptly for them in spite of reports that other companies have been offered payment on a 720-day basis or various barter deals.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="35"> R J Reynolds, which sold 14bn cigarettes to Russia last year, also expects to be producing Camel and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan later this year; and BAT is investigating opportunities.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="36"> In east Germany, Philip Morris has gained 44 per cent of the market by acquiring a former state-owned factory, and simply improving the quality of its F6 and Juwel brands as well as adding Marlboro to the range.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="37"> Reynolds, which also bought a factory, has had less success with the local Club brand and Camel, holding only a 7 per cent share.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="38"> occupied intermediate positions by using the factories of their west German subsidiaries to supply the new market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="39"> BAT has gained 11 per cent of the market, but its HB and Pall Mall brands lead the higher-priced segment.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="40"> Rothmans has adopted a more cautious approach than its rivals, apparently believing that there is scope for losing money as well as making it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="41"> But its Golden American brand, developed to provide 'good quality at an affordable price', has a 16 per cent share.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="42"> In Hungary, with an annual consumption of 26bn cigarettes, BAT has recently signed a joint venture agreement with the state-owned company at Pecs, which supplies 45 per cent of the market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="43"> It is also helping to improve the quality of the country's tobacco crop.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="44"> Philip Morris and the Austrian state tobacco monopoly have jointly bought another cigarette company near Budapest which has been making Marlboros under licence for the past 15 years and has a 24 per cent market share.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="45"> Multinationals are competing to set up operations through similar deals in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="46"> While profitable sales growth may be slow in eastern Europe, Far East markets, with rising populations and personal incomes, are already a prime source of profits.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="47"> Rothmans, for example, has 55 per cent of the Malaysian market, and it increased operating profits in 1990 by 70 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="48"> Since US trade pressures cracked the government monopoly in Japan in the mid-1980s, Philip Morris has captured an 11 per cent share of the 320bn cigarette market - almost double the combined share gained by its international rivals.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="49"> Volume sales of Marlboro and other PM brands, such as Lark, rose 22 per cent in 1990 to 35bn.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="50"> BAT, too, is well established through Lucky Strike and Kent, produced by its US subsidiary, Brown & Williamson.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="51"> Its John Player Special also occupies a profitable niche.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="52"> Rothmans, which still has less than 1 per cent of the market, is investing in marketing its mild Dunhill Lights.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="53"> South Korea, with an annual cigarette consumption of 96bn, has proved more difficult to penetrate.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="54"> Four years after liberalisation, imports account for only 4 per cent of the market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="55"> The national monopoly still dominates distribution channels, and the international companies complain of red tape and an anti-imports drive thinly disguised as a campaign against 'conspicuous consumption'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="56"> The 40bn cigarette market in Thailand was only opened to imports late last year; but the internationals are becoming well established in Taiwan.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="57"> Philip Morris brands lead the imports sector, but BAT's State Express 555 brand has a 23 per cent share and sales are growing vigorously.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="58"> Rothmans is optimistic about prospects in Indonesia, where western-style cigarettes have made little impression on a market dominated by locally produced kreteks, a blend of cloves and tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="59"> However, the prize on which all the multinationals have set their sights is China, where demand for cigarettes has grown by nearly 10 per cent a year over the past decade to 1,700bn, almost a third of the world's total consumption.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="60"> Reynolds has already established a joint venture company in the country; and Rothmans, which has long been associated with efforts to improve Chinese tobacco farming, is a partner in a joint venture company which will begin to manufacture cigarettes in Shandong province in June.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="61"> Philip Morris and BAT, with its State Express, Kent and Hilton brands, have been successful in selling into duty free and other hard currency outlets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="62"> Imports, according to Philip Morris, still account for only 0.3 per cent of Chinese consumption.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="63"> Because of constraints on hard currency, nobody expects any rapid growth in the near future.</s>

<s docid="FT921-11387" num="64"> But the prospective rewards are worth a little patience: just over 5 per cent of the market would equal total cigarette sales in the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="6"> The Marlboro cowboy may have looked bedraggled and saddle-sore in the US this year but he is still riding high elsewhere in the world.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="7"> The cigarette brand's manufacturer, Philip Morris, has fought fiercely in the past six months to protect its advertising icon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="8"> It is anxious to restore Marlboro's standing in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="9"> But protecting home sales is not the only motive.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="10"> It also fears that any further slippage in its standing in the US would hit its growing international business.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="11"> The emphasis on strengthing an image in new markets is not unique to Philip Morris.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="12"> As the US, along with other western markets, have turned away from cigarette consumption in the face of health lobbies and government regulation, the multinational producers have had to look elsewhere - such as the Far East - for sales growth.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="13"> This week came evidence that Philip Morris' strategy is paying off.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="14"> Its daring decision in April to cut prices in the US by 20 per cent reversed some of the fall in sales over recent years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="15"> Marlboro's market share in the US has risen from 24 per cent to 25.7 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="16"> More spectacularly, results for the quarter to September showed operating profits outside the US up 15 per cent on the same period a year before.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="17"> Although the US, where 500bn cigarettes are consumed a year, and western Europe, where 750bn are smoked annually, will continue to be important markets for Philip Morris and other tobacco groups, such as BAT Industries, R J Reynolds and Rothmans International, it is the international market that will provide the long-term opportunities.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="18"> What has transformed the prospects for the multinationals has been the opening of new markets in Asia and the Pacific Rim and in eastern Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="19"> A decade ago, 4,500bn cigarettes were smoked a year worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="20"> But 60 per cent of the market was closed to the multinationals by trade barriers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="21"> Removal of restrictions in the fast-growing economies of the Far East and the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, have now given western multinationals access to all but 5 per cent of a global market that has grown to 5,330bn cigarettes, in spite of recent worldwide recession.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="22"> Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, for instance, have lifted trade barriers since the mid-1980s - usually under pressure from a US government that was discouraging smoking in its own backyard.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="23"> China, the biggest market in the world with an annual consumption of 1,705bn cigarettes, still restricts imports to hard currency outlets, but has said it will open the door wider in 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="24"> Philip Morris this year signed a co-operation agreement with the state tobacco company to produce Marlboro cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="25"> In Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, tobacco multinationals headed the race by western companies to establish operations in the former communist states, a market of 643bn cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="26"> Such emerging markets present almost a mirror image of conditions in the US and western Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="27"> In the Far East and east Europe, the smoking habit is spreading and is socially acceptable.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="28"> Anti-smoking campaigners are less vociferous.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="29"> Restrictions on advertising are relatively weak or weakly enforced.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="30"> The contrast between the mature and developing markets can be stark.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="31"> While a Los Angeles court recently removed a child from the custody of a mother who smoked, children sell cigarettes on almost every street corner in Manila.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="32"> Whereas in the west, the health hazard is top of people's minds, in Russia's parlous economy the jobs created by the investments of tobacco companies weigh more heavily.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="33"> Moreover cigarettes have the status of a currency which, unlike the rouble, does not depreciate.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="34"> Tobacco multinationals are flourishing in these conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="35"> World sales of international brands, such as Marlboro, grew by 7 per cent a year between 1989 and 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="36"> BAT, which exported 45bn cigarettes in 1989, almost trebled the number to 129bn last year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="37"> US companies shipped 18bn cigarettes to the Pacific Rim in 1985; last year, the number rose to 87bn.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="38"> To cope with the demand from these markets, Philip Morris is completing a Dollars 400m expansion of its plant in North Carolina, increasing production capacity by 50 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="39"> BAT is investing Pounds 175m in its Southampton factory in southern England to double annual production to 55bn cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="40"> The inroads made into Far East markets - where many consumers aspire to what they perceive to be a western lifestyle - is almost certainly producing the biggest contributions to profit, although no group gives a regional breakdown.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="41"> Philip Morris has secured 12 per cent of the Japanese market, the world's fourth largest.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="42"> BAT's Kent and Lucky Strike brands both rank in the top five of Japan's best-selling imported cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="43"> The two groups dominate the now growing imported sector in Taiwan.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="44"> Rothmans International this year merged its tobacco interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong to strengthen its operations in the region.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="45"> Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, says: 'The move enables it to use the cash built up in the mature markets of Malaysia and Singapore to exploit the biggest growth markets in the world'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="46"> Outside the Far East, slower economic growth mean returns from investments will take longer to secure.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="47"> Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's chairman, says significant profits on the group's east European ventures are not expected for at least 10 years, 'possibly 25'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="48"> Establishing operations in the former Soviet bloc also requires a deal of management agility to surmount obstacles presented either by the absence of any framework of commercial law or a maze of regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="49"> 'Businessmen,' says Sir Patrick, 'are marooned in a command economy'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="50"> In Russia, BAT is setting up a joint venture with Yava, Moscow's largest cigarette factory; Rothmans is investing Pounds 55m in a joint venture in St Petersburg; and Philip Morris this year bought into its third cigarette company.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13045" num="51"> Other ventures are being set up in the the CIS and other east European countries; in the Czech republic, Philip Morris paid Dollars 400m for a majority of the Tabak company which controls 80 per cent of the country's tobacco market.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="7"> Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group that makes Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette, shrugged off strong anti-smoking sentiment in the US and reported a 17.6 per cent surge in after-tax profits to Dollars 1.23bn (Pounds 783m) in its second quarter.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="8"> It was the first profits increase reported by Philip Morris since Marlboro Friday in April last year, when the company slashed the price of Marlboro and other premium brands in the US to win back market share from cheaper products.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="9"> Worldwide, Philip Morris sold 18 per cent more cigarettes in the three months to June than a year earlier.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="10"> Marlboro volumes rose 18 per cent to 99bn cigarettes and volumes of all Philip Morris brands rose 17.9 per cent to 187bn cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="11"> Philip Morris cited strong volume gains in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea, Argentina and Brazil.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="12"> Growth was particularly strong in the domestic market, where Philip Morris increased sales by 21.9 per cent to 57.9bn cigarettes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="13"> Philip Morris acknowledged that US gains were inflated by an increase in stocks as wholesalers accelerated purchases in expectation of a rise in federal excise tax.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="14"> Last year's second quarter, by contrast, had seen stock levels cut; so the industry as a whole had experienced 11 per cent growth in US volumes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="15"> However, the price cuts enabled Philip Morris to increase its market share by 5 percentage points to 46.6 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="16"> Marlboro's share rose by 6.5 percentage points to a record 28.5 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="17"> Although Philip Morris was selling its cigarettes at lower prices in the US, the increased volumes helped lift operating income in the domestic tobacco division by 25.1 per cent to Dollars 858m - seemingly vindicating the strategy of Mr Michael Miles, the chairman and chief executive ousted three weeks ago, who instigated Marlboro Friday.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="18"> Mr Miles fell out with the board over his support for a plan to lift Philip Morris's share price by hiving off cigarette-making operations into a separate entity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="19"> His successors - Mr William Murray, chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive - have ruled out a split for the forsee-able future.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="20"> Paradoxically, the food side of the business performed relatively poorly in the second quarter: worldwide operating income rose only 2.4 per cent to Dollars 949m, while operating income on the tobacco side rose 22.4 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="21"> Philip Morris blamed investment costs in emerging markets and adverse exchange rates.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="22"> Group turnover rose from Dollars 15.8bn to Dollars 16.4bn.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="23"> Earnings per share increased 19.3 per cent to Dollars 1.42, helped by share repurchases.</s>

<s docid="FT943-14694" num="24"> Net income for the first six months rose 6.2 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="5"> By RICHARD TOMKINS</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="6"> Anyone wanting a simple explanation for Mr Michael Miles's abrupt departure from the top job at Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, at the weekend need look no further than the 40 per cent fall in the company's share price in the last nine months.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="7"> The heads of many a US corporate giant have recently rolled for less.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="8"> But the greater significance of Mr Miles's resignation is that it marks a triumph for those within the company who are set on keeping cigarette-making as the group's core activity in defiance of the powerful US anti-smoking lobby.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="9"> Just 10 years ago, cigarette-making accounted for the overwhelming majority of Philip Morris's revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="10"> But faced with the prospect of a long-term decline in smoking, it decided to use the cash-flow from its tobacco operations to finance a diversification into the food industry.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="11"> Under its then chairman and chief executive, the charismatic Mr Hamish Maxwell, it made a series of big acquisitions, including those of General Foods in 1985, Kraft in 1988, and Jacobs Suchard in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="12"> By last year the food operations had grown to the size where they were contributing nearly 50 per cent of group turnover (though only 34 per cent of group operating profits).</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="13"> When Mr Miles took over from Mr Maxwell as chairman and chief executive in 1991, he was the first person from outside the tobacco industry to lead the group.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="14"> As the former chairman and chief executive of Kraft, he had risen to the top from the food side of the business, and some analysts say the non-smoking 54-year-old seemed ill at ease in the role of Marlboro man.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="15"> He was not made any more comfortable when Philip Morris's US cigarette-making activities started to come under increasing pressure - first, through a loss of market share to low-price competition and second, from the outbreak of an unprecedented wave of opposition from the US anti-smoking lobby.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="16"> Mr Miles's response to the first threat came in April last year on a day remembered as Marlboro Friday, when he horrified shareholders by slashing the price of Marlboro cigarettes and Philip Morris's other premium brands to win back market share.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="17"> The move succeeded in boosting sales, but prompted a price war in the US cigarette market and contributed to a fall in the company's after-tax profits from Dollars 4.9bn to Dollars 3.6bn last year.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="18"> Since then, US cigarette prices have crept up a little and Philip Morris looks set to claw back some of its lost profits this year.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="19"> But two months ago the corporate boat was rocked again when the Financial Times disclosed that its top managers were considering a plan to hive off the troublesome tobacco operations into a separate company.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="20"> Some investors cautiously welcomed the idea as a way of relieving Philip Morris's share price from the depressive effect of its controversial association with cigarette-making.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="21"> But to people who had spent years building up the company in its present form as a food and tobacco conglomerate - notably the retired Mr Maxwell, still a highly influential member of Philip Morris's board - it was anathema.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="22"> Matters came to a head at a rancorous board meeting last month.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="23"> After more than six hours of debate - which ranged, it is said, over Mr Miles's performance as chairman and chief executive as well as the merits and demerits of the restructuring scheme - the plan was rejected.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="24"> Instead, the board promoted Mr William Murray from chief operating officer to vice chairman for world-wide food, and Mr Geoffrey Bible from executive vice president to vice chairman for world-wide tobacco.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="25"> The significance of this move was that, although both men had spent time on the food side of Philip Morris, both had strong backgrounds in the tobacco side of the business, having joined Philip Morris long before the expansion into food began.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="26"> As such, they were very much Mr Maxwell's proteges.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="27"> Their elevation must have made Mr Miles's position even more uncomfortable than it already was.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="28"> Three weeks later, Mr Miles has gone and the two Maxwell proteges have been promoted again - Mr Murray taking over Mr Miles's role as chairman and Mr Bible becoming president and chief executive.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="29"> Mr Miles put as brave face as possible on the turn of events: he said he left 'with full confidence that the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven right by our results in 1994 and beyond', and added that the recovery of Philip Morris's US tobacco business and the continued growth in international tobacco meant it made sense for someone from the tobacco side to take charge.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="30"> The triumph of the smoking faction at Philip Morris means that the notion splitting off the tobacco side of the business is almost certainly dead.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="31"> Yet the US stock market reacted well to the change in management, lifting Philip Morris's share price Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 50 7/8 at yesterday's close.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="32"> Why? Stock market analysts such as Mr Gary Black at Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street brokerage, say the trouble with Philip Morris was not so much the difficulties it was experiencing with its cigarette operations in the US as a lack of leadership and a decline in employee morale.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="33"> Mr Miles was a notoriously low-profile chairman and chief executive, declining to face the press and rarely meeting analysts.</s>

<s docid="FT942-2078" num="34"> Investors hope that a new and more aggressive leadership will be better at explaining to analysts and the financial media why gloom about the future profitability of the tobacco operations is wildly overdone - and that this will do more to enhance shareholder value than any break up of the business could hope to achieve.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="9"> In the same quarter a year ago, after a Dollars 65m charge for debt repurchase and retirement, the group earned net income of Dollars 77m.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="10"> Excluding extraordinary items, RJR's first-half profits rose to Dollars 386m, up from a comparable Dollars 352m a year earlier.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="11"> The company said improved domestic tobacco margins, rising international cigarette sales, and a strong performance from its worldwide food businesses were behind the advance during the quarter.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="12"> It was the first reporting period not affected by last year's so-called Marlboro Friday, when Philip Morris prompted a price war among cigarette makers by cutting the price of its premium brands.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="13"> Operating income during the three months was Dollars 675m on sales of Dollars 3.78bn, up from Dollars 582m a year earlier on sales of Dollars 3.72bn.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="14"> Amid continued aggressive expansion overseas, most notably in former Soviet bloc countries, RJR's international tobacco business again performed strongly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="15"> However, foreign exchange losses - said by analysts to total Dollars 28m - took their toll.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="16"> The group's Nabisco foods business reported a 20 per cent increase in operating earnings, with domestic biscuit sales again posting impressive growth.</s>

<s docid="FT943-12012" num="17"> RJR's results were in line with analysts' forecasts, but their failure to match the better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of rivals Philip Morris and American Brands disappointed some investors, who bid the group's stock down Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 in New York.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="8"> The sharp decline reflects the impact of price wars with its main rival Philip Morris, but Wall Street was prepared for the downturn and shares held steady at Dollars 5 3/8 in early trading.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="9"> Net income in the quarter was Dollars 76m, including a one-time gain of Dollars 2m on sales which fell 11 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. A year earlier, RJR earned Dollars 175m, including one-time charges of Dollars 70m, on sales of Dollars 4bn.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="10"> RJR's earnings per share tumbled to 4 cents from 13 cents, while operating income eased 44 per cent to Dollars 431m from Dollars 763m.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="11"> The company warned it would take significant charges in the fourth quarter to cover cost-cutting and other performance improvement measures.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="12"> RJR had warned of a 43 per cent shortfall in operating income from US tobacco operations for the whole of 1993 and the third-quarter results were exactly as most analysts had predicted.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="15"> Overall, the group's tobacco business posted sales of Dollars 1.87bn, down 20 per cent from the Dollars 2.33bn reported in the same period of last year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="19"> US sales fell 29 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12281" num="20"> The company blamed a less favourable product mix and lower overall volume for the erosion, in addition to discounted prices.</s>

<s docid="FT933-608" num="8"> The company, which already has a strong presence in eastern Europe and Russia, said it had agreed to a deal in which it would gain control of Almaty Tobacco Kombinat, a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation which employs 1,700.</s>

<s docid="FT933-608" num="11"> Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the group said it was committed to spending at least Dollars 200m over the next five years to modernise ATK's manufacturing facilities.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="7"> Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, continued its bounce-back from last year's depressed figures with a 27 per cent surge in net profits to Dollars 1.2bn in its third quarter.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="8"> In April last year Philip Morris cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes and its other premium brands in the US to win back market share from low-cost rivals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="9"> This led to a series of adverse quarterly earnings comparisons which only began to abate in the second quarter of this year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="10"> The biggest single component of the profits growth reported yesterday was the recovery in Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="11"> Operating income from this division shot up by 40 per cent to Dollars 863m because volumes rose in response to the company's increased market share.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="12"> The company also saw profit increases in its other food and tobacco divisions.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="13"> International tobacco increased operating income by 18 per cent to Dollars 800m, international food was up 12 per cent at Dollars 269m, North American food up 6 per cent at Dollars 618m, and Miller Brewing up 18 per cent at Dollars 111m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="14"> Overall, group revenues rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="15"> Earnings per share advanced 28 per cent to Dollars 1.42, a touch above the Dollars 1.40 expected by analysts, but the shares eased back Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 in a falling market.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="16"> Philip Morris said it sold 201bn cigarettes world-wide during the quarter, up 16 per cent from the comparable quarter's figure.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="17"> Outside the US, the volume of cigarettes sold rose by 19 per cent to 144bn, with growth in most markets except Turkey, where sales were affected by poor economic conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="18"> In the US, Philip Morris said profits from tobacco had been boosted by the fact that a greater portion of the volume mix came from premium brands.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="19"> It quoted figures suggesting that Marlboro's market share had risen to a record 29.1 per cent in August, 7 percentage points higher than the period just before last year's price cuts.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15211" num="20"> Mr William Murray, chairman, said he was confident the company would be able to sustain its strong momentum.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="7"> PHILIP Morris, which set alarm bells ringing over branded products when it announced a sharp price cut for its flagship Marlboro cigarettes, yesterday reported a fall in profits from its domestic tobacco division in the first quarter of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="8"> The US tobacco, food and brewing company said the division, which traditionally accounts for more than half of group operating profits, made Dollars 1.016bn at the operating level, down from Dollars 1.027bn in the same period of 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="9"> Operating revenues for the division were 4.2 per cent higher at Dollars 2.54bn, but domestic cigarette shipments were down by 1.1 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="10"> Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette brand in the US and whose market position has been threatened by the explosive growth in discount cigarettes, saw an 8.3 per cent fall in shipments, to 22.6bn units.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="11"> The inroads being made by discount cigarettes - which Philip Morris suggested yesterday account for 39 per cent of the US cigarette industry - prompted the group to announce the effective price cut of about 40 cents a packet for Marlboro.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="12"> At the time, Philip Morris warned that the move could cut operating profits from its domestic tobacco unit by as much as 40 per cent this year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="13"> The US tobacco division, contributed to an overall 10.8 per cent advance in Philip Morris's first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 1.22bn, a much slower growth rate than the company has reported in recent years.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="14"> Total revenues were up by 8.1 per cent at Dollars 15.2bn.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="15"> The international tobacco operations saw a sharp 18 per cent operating profits rise, at Dollars 675m.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="16"> On the food side, the US businesses improved by 14.7 per cent, to Dollars 626m, while the international food division reported a 10.5 per cent gain, at Dollars 242m.</s>

<s docid="FT932-13912" num="17"> The beer division made operating profits of Dollars 93m, up from Dollars 81m a year ago.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="6"> Peter Mead is a 30-a-day smoker who thinks tobacco advertising should be banned.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="7"> He knows it isn't entirely logical, but he feels some degree of reassurance every time he sees a cigarette advertisement.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="8"> 'At the back of my mind I have to believe the government wouldn't allow something that's going to kill me to be advertised'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="9"> Mr Mead is chairman of Abbott Mead Vickers, a top UK advertising agency which refuses tobacco company business.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="10"> Dominic Proctor, London chief executive of New York-based agency J Walter Thompson, which has among its clients the tobacco company Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of the US company American Brands, takes the rather less exceptional line for an advertising man.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="11"> 'There should be freedom to advertise anything which it is legal to market,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="12"> In Brussels today the arguments which currently divide the advertising industry will be reflected in a debate between European Union health ministers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="13"> Under discussion is a European Commission draft directive that would ban all tobacco advertising, apart from point-of-sale material, across the EU.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="14"> The Commission's action has been prompted by research showing tobacco products cause 430,000 deaths a year in EU countries.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="15"> Among the middle-aged population, tobacco products are responsible for at least a quarter of all deaths.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="16"> The Commission also says prohibiting advertising will overcome the problem of differing rules across member states preventing the free flow of, for instance, magazines containing cigarette advertisments.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="17"> In response, the tobacco and advertising industries point out that the keenest advocates of the plan - France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - either have state-run tobacco companies or allow other companies to operate a monopoly.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="18"> It would be harder for others to compete against the dominant players in these countries if they were not allowed to promote their products.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="19"> They also warn that a ban could set a worrying precedent: today Brussels wants to outlaw tobacco advertising, tomorrow it could be fast cars, children's toys, pharmaceuticals or Black Forest gateaux.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="20"> For the moment, at least, it is likely that the Commission will be unable to persuade EU states to support its directive, as it has been since the directive was first put on the table in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="21"> Realising that agreement is unlikely, supporters of a ban will probably not push for a vote today.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="22"> In the past it has been Germany, Denmark, Holland, Greece and the UK which have blocked a comprehensive ban.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="23"> Greece, under its new Socialist government, may have softened its stance.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="24"> But the four remaining opponents have enough votes under the qualified majority voting system to continue blocking its progress.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="25"> The position of the UK could prove pivotal.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="26"> It has been the most vociferous opponent of an EU-wide ban and it is widely thought that Denmark and the Netherlands would switch sides if the UK were to change its position.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="27"> So far the British have preferred a policy of a voluntary approach to restricting advertising and high taxes on tobacco products - the duty on tobacco was increased by 7 per cent in last month's Budget.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="28"> Tobacco advertisers in Europe believe they have won a reprieve - but no more.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="29"> Privately, many in the advertising industry see public opinion forcing an end to tobacco advertising in Europe within three or four years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="30"> An indication of the mounting pressure of public opinion is already being seen in the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="31"> The government is expected soon to announce it will be negotiating tighter 'voluntary' controls with the tobacco and advertising industries.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="32"> Options include an end to poster advertising, a ban on tobacco advertisements in womens' magazines, removing shopfront advertising, and larger health warnings on packs.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="33"> Proposals along these lines could help to head off the threat of cross-party support growing for a private member's bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Kevin Barron which the government is highly likely to want to block.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="34"> Such proposals would also provide something for ministers to offer at a European level as an alternative to the proposed ban.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="35"> The advertising sector accepts that such a move in the UK could presage an eventual crumbling of UK resistance to a EU wide ban.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="36"> And it is already preparing accordingly even though the European Commission calculates that tobacco advertising makes up less than 3 per cent of advertising for all goods and services in the 12 member states.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="37"> For example, Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman of More O'Ferrall, the hoardings company which has operations across Europe says: 'The job of our marketing has been to broaden the base of customer demand in all our markets, so that we are not too dependent on one sector'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="38"> While there is clearly movement towards further restrictions in Europe, voluntary or otherwise, there is no definitive answer to one question which ought to be central.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="39"> Does a ban on advertising cut the number of smokers?</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="40"> The Tobacco Advisory Council, the UK trade body, says that the sole purpose of tobacco advertising is to promote competition and encourage existing smokers to switch brands.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="41"> It estimates that the value of business from smokers who switch is worth Pounds 3bn a year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="42"> It denies that advertising encourages smoking.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="43"> Not so, according to Dr Clive Smee, the department of health's chief economist.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="44"> Last year he reported that studies of Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Norway, where tobacco advertising bans have been in operation, showed 'a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="45"> But his research appears to clash with a study by Michael Stewart, an econometrician, in the May edition of the International Journal of Advertising.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="46"> That showed a slight increase in smoking in those countries where there has been a ban.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="47"> A possible reason is that banning advertising also means no health warnings to put off smokers, except on packets.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="48"> 'This increase is not quite statistically significant, but clearly refutes the belief that advertising bans have appreciably reduced consumption,' concludes Mr Stewart.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="49"> As he points out, the space now devoted to the health warnings is the 'equivalent of millions of Ecus of ongoing anti-smoking advertising' across Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="50"> If European health ministers decide that they want to impose a ban on advertisments, they may need to seek some alternative ways of funding those warnings.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="51"> But the niceties of this debate are unlikely to worry the tobacco companies, although they will continue to lobby vigorously against any measure which could affect sales.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="52"> The companies already know that tobacco consumption in western European markets is dropping as concerns about the health effects spread and as smoking becomes less socially acceptable.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="53"> The decline is not sharp - about 2.5 per cent in volume terms in EU countries over the past five years - but it is steady and shows no sign of slowing.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="54"> In contrast, new markets are opening in Asia and the Pacific Rim, and in eastern Europe, where smoking is gaining in popularity and sales.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="55"> In China, for example, cigarette sales grew from 1,649bn to 1,705bn in between 1991 and 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT934-2629" num="56"> With such virgin territories to play for, the possibility of an ban on advertising in Europe may ultimately appear to be a a small distraction.</s>
