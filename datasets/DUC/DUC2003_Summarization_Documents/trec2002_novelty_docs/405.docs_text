<s docid="FT922-11472" num="6"> Cosmology is in a ferment this weekend, as scientists study the first pictures ever received of the young universe, expanding out of the Big Bang which created everything about 15bn years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="7"> The observations, made from space by a US satellite, show gigantic ripples of matter forming from the original cosmic fireball.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="8"> These are by far the earliest signs of the 'lumpiness' of the universe, which gravity was later to pull together into galaxies, stars, planets and the objects familiar from life on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="9"> The significance of the discovery, announced on Thursday, may not match some of yesterday's fevered newspaper headlines, which suggested that the 'riddle of the universe' was now solved.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="10"> Even so, it is the most important event in cosmology since 1964, when scientists detected microwave radiation coming uniformly from all parts of the sky - a faint after-glow left over from the Big Bang itself.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="11"> That evidence convinced most cosmologists that the Big Bang theory of the universe was broadly correct and discredited the rival Steady State theory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="12"> But it left several mysteries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="13"> How could everything become so evenly mixed in the instant following the Big Bang?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="14"> And how could this evenly distributed matter then clump together?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="15"> This week's discovery - the result of 300m observations made over the course of a year by Nasa's Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (Cobe) - will help cosmologists to resolve these mysteries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="16"> Cobe has found variations in the cosmic background radiation which had previously seemed to come so evenly from all directions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="17"> Analysis by computer proves that these are genuine fluctuations in the after-glow from the Big Bang, rather than distortions caused by radiation from astronomical objects.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="18"> The variations represent huge ripples of matter, stretching across billions of light-years of space and dating back about 15bn years to when the universe was just 300,000 years old.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="19"> At that time all matter was as hot as the sun today.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="20"> The most powerful telescopes have already shown objects such as quasars and galaxies so far away that their radiation set out when the universe was 1bn years old or less than 10 per cent of its present age.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="21"> Cobe has in effect taken a huge leap back in time to a universe 0.002 per cent of its present age.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="22"> It may be impossible ever to 'see' further into the past than that; when the universe was less than 300,000 years old it was too dense to allow radiation to escape.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="23"> But scientists will use Cobe's observations - which will become sharper as the satellite spends more time in orbit - to extrapolate back to within a tiny fraction of a second of the Big Bang.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="24"> Nasa scientists say the first fuzzy pictures from Cobe agree with a version of the Big Bang theory known as 'inflationary cosmology'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="25"> It postulates that the universe had a burst of unbelievably rapid expansion - faster even than the speed of light - during a period lasting less than one trillionth of a second, immediately after its creation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="26"> All the fundamental particles and forces we know today originated during this inflationary micro-period.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="27"> At the same time, minute fluctuations in the density of matter arose, leading to the cosmic ripples seen by Cobe and eventually the uneven universe in which we live.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="28"> The Cobe observations also support the widely held theory that the familiar objects seen by astronomers - galaxies, stars, planets, quasars, interstellar dust clouds and so on - make up less than 10 per cent and perhaps as little as 1 per cent of all material in the universe today.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="29"> This is because the amount of gravity provided by the visible fluctuations is not nearly enough to pull together galaxies and clusters of galaxies.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="30"> The remainder of the universe consists of mysterious 'dark matter'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="31"> Mr Edward Wright, a Cobe scientist from the University of California, said this 'must be a new kind of matter, not yet detected.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="32"> We need such invisible matter to explain how galaxies formed in the early universe and gathered themselves together into huge clusters.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="33"> Ordinary matter would be attracted into regions of concentrated dark matter and the universe as we know it today could develop'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="34"> Particle physicists have proposed a long list of exotic particles left over from the Big Bang, as possible candidates to make up the dark matter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="35"> They include heavy neutrinos, Higgsinos, gravitinos, axions, photinos and wimps (weakly interacting massive particles).</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="36"> The Cobe observations tell us nothing directly about the identity of dark matter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="37"> But they give a basis for calculating how much dark matter there is in the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="38"> That is the vital issue for the future of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="39"> Is there enough matter for gravity to stop the universe expanding and to draw everything together again in a Big Crunch tens of billions of years from now?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="40"> Or will the universe continue flying apart for ever, as the stars gradually burn out and everything spreads out into an infinite coldness?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="41"> The first reaction of some scientists to the Cobe results was that they supported the idea of a 'closed universe' which would pull itself back together.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="42"> Others continued to support the 'open universe' theory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="43"> Professor Martin Rees, director of Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, said tentatively that they were consistent with a 'flat universe' precisely balanced between being open and closed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="44"> What is needed now to solve the riddle of the universe is more precise observations from Cobe, backed up by ground-based instruments which Prof Rees said would soon be able to detect irregularities in the background radiation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="45"> It is reasonable to expect that, by the end of the century, there will be a scientific consensus about the ultimate fate of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11472" num="46"> That may be of no practical use to anyone, but it is bound to have a cultural and social impact on humanity, knowing whether our ultimate future is in another cosmic fireball or cold nothingness.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="6"> A US SATELLITE has found gigantic ripples of matter near the edge of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="7"> The discovery promises to explain how stars and galaxies evolved from the Big Bang - the cataclysmic explosion that created everything about 15bn years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="8"> The finding, announced last night at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington, is the most important event in cosmology since 1964, when scientists detected a faint after-glow of the Big Bang.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="9"> 'What we have found is evidence for the birth of the universe,' said Mr George Smoot of the University of California at Berkeley, who led the National Aeronautics and Space Administration team that made the discovery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="10"> The Cosmic Background Explorer (Cobe) spacecraft, launched in 1989, has detected variations within the after-glow.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="11"> These arose from fluctuations in the universe one-trillionth (million-millionth) of a second after its creation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="12"> The discovery points the way to a solution to one of the greatest puzzles in science: how did matter that was uniformly spread in the original Big Bang start clumping together to produce stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies?</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="13"> Professor Michael Turner, a University of Chicago physicist at the Washington meeting, said the significance of the Cobe find 'cannot be overstated - they have found the Holy Grail of cosmology'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="14"> Mr Smoot said the ripples, which are very wispy clouds of matter, were the largest and most ancient structures in the universe, stretching across billions of light-years of space and dating back about 15bn years to when the universe was just 300,000 years old The ripples were created by the universe's rapid expansion after the Big Bang.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="15"> Then gravity made increasing amounts of matter clump together, eventually creating galaxies and stars.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="16"> Evidence collected by the satellite after 300 million measurements of background radiation from the Big Bang also supports the theory that up to 90 per cent of the universe is invisible 'dark matter' which scientists have not been able to identify, Nasa said.</s>

<s docid="FT922-11525" num="17"> The temperatures and sizes of the variations in the radiation agree with a theory called 'inflationary cosmology', which explains how minute fluctuations after the Big Bang created the pattern of the universe as we know it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="6"> Jupiter bears the dark scars of last month's cometary bombardment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="7"> Any amateur astronomer with a telescope can see a band of bold black marks across the giant planet, some as large as Earth.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="8"> The 21 fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 also made a powerful impact on the public imagination - partly because professional astronomers had prepared the ground well, for example laying on press conferences to brief the media about what some predicted would be the greatest cosmic spectacle since the invention of the telescope.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="9"> Fortunately the show lived up to the advance billing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="10"> Why did it arouse so much interest and excitement?</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="11"> Although the television pictures were impressive, showing fireballs and debris rising hundreds of miles above Jupiter's thin atmosphere, we have seen more spectacular views from space.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="12"> Think of the close-ups of Saturn's twisted rings taken by the two Voyager spacecraft in the 1980s, let alone man's first steps on the moon 25 years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="13"> And for us as individuals, what we see in the heavens with our own eyes - for example an unexpected shower of shooting stars or the flicker of the Northern lights - surpasses in beauty and visual impact anything we experience through the electronic media.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="14"> The great appeal of Shoemaker-Levy lay in the event's unscripted cosmic violence, spiced by imagining what would have happened if the series of kilometre-sized rocks had hit here instead of Jupiter.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="15"> They would have wiped out most life on Earth, just like the giant meteorite that is believed to have ended the dinosaur era 65m years ago when it left a crater stretching 180km across what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="16"> The dark marks smeared across Jupiter's southern hemisphere are dust and/or soot thrown into the upper atmosphere by the explosion of the cometary fragments.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="17"> Astronomers expect them to persist for many months.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="18"> On Earth, that much smoke and dust would plunge the whole planet into a sunless, icy 'impact winter'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="19"> As human agriculture and natural food chains collapsed, few living creatures could escape starving or freezing to death.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="20"> Earth is a far smaller target than Jupiter; its surface area is 100 times less and it weighs 300 times less.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="21"> But the bombardment of Jupiter has strengthened the hands of those who argue that we are at greater risk of destruction by an aberrant asteroid or comet than astronomers had believed - and that we should be doing something to protect ourselves.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="22"> Over the past 20 years or so, the view that Earth's history is punctuated by cosmic cataclysms has moved from the bizarre sidelines of astronomical theory to the mainstream.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="23"> A respectable estimate now is that for an average American or European the likelihood of dying because a comet or asteroid hits Earth is similar to the chance of being killed in an air crash: about 1 in 20,000.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="24"> In Washington, the Shoemaker-Levy show has convinced doubting politicians that the risk is real - not just a ploy by astronomers to extract federal funds.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="25"> Congressmen are rallying to support plans to spend Dollars 250m over the next 20 years on an early warning network of telescopes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="26"> The proposed Spaceguard system would map the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 asteroids and comets whose paths may cross Earth's orbit around the sun.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="27"> Spaceguard would give warning times of impact with Earth ranging from several decades for an asteroid with a circular orbit to perhaps a year for a comet with a highly elliptical orbit.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="28"> That might or might not be long enough to send a rocket to detonate a nuclear weapon and deflect the intruder into a non-threatening path.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="29"> However, for the thousands of astronomers, amateur and professional, who observed the Jovian bombardment and are watching its aftermath, the implications for Earth are very much a secondary consideration.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="30"> They are interested above all in learning as much as possible from the collisions about the nature of Jupiter and of comets.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="31"> Few firm scientific conclusions have emerged yet from the vast mass of observations.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="32"> Previous space spectaculars, such Voyager's planetary fly-by and Giotto's encounter with Halley's Comet, were based on specific spacecraft, co-ordinated by mission controllers.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="33"> The Shoemaker-Levy collision, in contrast, is a free-for-all with no one in charge.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="34"> An unprecedent amount of data flew around the world's computer networks during the bombardment, as astronomers exchanged the latest news by electronic mail; indeed the event was said to have caused the first serious jam on Internet.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="35"> The lines are now humming with preliminary thoughts about what to make of it all.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="36"> Key questions still to be answered include: how deeply the comet's fragments penetrated Jupiter's atmosphere before they exploded; whether they arrived as solid lumps or as loose aggregates of ice and rock; and what chemicals were thrown into the upper atmosphere from the lower levels.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="37"> Shoemaker-Levy may have faded from the headlines but its marks on Jupiter are proving longer lasting than astronomers had predicted.</s>

<s docid="FT943-10128" num="38"> For Earth, its legacy will be a better understanding of planetary science and - conceivably -an early warning system to save us all from a cosmic cataclysm.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="6"> Ulysses, the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar system, will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above the south pole of the Sun.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="7"> The Dollars 750m (Pounds 480m) Ulysses mission is a joint project of the US and European space agencies, dedicated to exploring the heliosphere.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="8"> This region contains mainly ions (charged atoms) and electrons emanating from the Sun - a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar space by the Sun's hot breath, the solar wind.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="9"> It encompasses the whole solar system, except for the planets and their atmospheres.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="10"> Because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn Sun about 5bn years ago, they all lie within one plane, known as the ecliptic, which is tilted only slightly from the Sun's equatorial plane.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="11"> To explore the solar wind and magnetic field, free of the turbulence and other complications caused by the planets, John Simpson of the University of Chicago proposed in 1959 sending a space probe over the Sun's poles.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="12"> The idea became technically feasible in the 1970s, and in 1977 the European Space Agency agreed to collaborate with Nasa on the Ulysses project.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="13"> No rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the ecliptic, because it has to cancel Earth's motion around the Sun of 30 km/sec and build up speed in a new direction.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="14"> But Ulysses' designers realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet Jupiter to propel their car-sized probe into a new plane, like a slingshot (see diagram).</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="15"> All went well from 1977 until 1980, when the project began an odyssey of setbacks and delays, caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties at Nasa.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="16"> Ulysses was eventually launched on a Space Shuttle in October 1990, seven and a half years after the original target date.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="17"> Once in space, Ulysses performed perfectly.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="18"> Project scientists took advantage of its swing past Jupiter in February 1992 to make the first detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents, particles and magnetic fields surrounding the planet.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="19"> On route to the Sun's south pole, the nine scientific instruments on Ulysses have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere: shock waves in the solar wind; electromagnetic waves with a very long period (more than 10 hours); regular bursts of energetic particles from the Sun; enormous clouds of ionised gas; and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from elsewhere in the galaxy.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="20"> The investigators are still working out the significance of these observations.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="21"> 'This is our first ever 'bird's eye view' of the Sun's magnetic poles,' says Roger Bonnet, Esa's science director.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="22"> 'This new perspective will cast some light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of the solar interior.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="23"> 'It may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity and forecast their effect on Earth,' he adds.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="24"> For example, Ulysses may give some clues about the impact of the 11-year sunspot cycle on terrestrial climate.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="25"> Although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute, some old-timers are still involved.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="26"> Willis Meeks, Nasa's Ulysses project manager, has been working on it for 16 years.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="27"> And Simpson, the 'father of Ulysses', is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments, which looks at the behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="28"> 'I have had plenty of opportunities to fly experiments on other missions,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="29"> 'But Ulysses remains unique, as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar regions of the Sun's heliosphere'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="30"> The spacecraft's new polar orbit will carry it over the Sun's north pole next summer.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="31"> Although current plans call for the mission to end in October 1995, Esa and Nasa are keen to continue observing until the end of 2001.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="32"> They say the modest extra cost, Dollars 50m, would pay large scientific dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on the Sun, whereas 2000-2001 will be a period of maximum solar activity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="33"> Whatever happens next, Ulysses has already paid off in Simpson's eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="34"> 'We don't have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort and reward the long wait,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-3693" num="35"> 'We already know they do.'</s>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="9"> An asteroid half a mile wide, blazing through space at nearly 50,000 m.p.h., skirted past Earth last month in a cosmic "close call" unrivaled in the last 50 years, NASA officials said Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="10"> The asteroid, identified as 1989FC, passed within 500,000 miles of Earth -- about twice the distance to the moon -- on March 23, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported.</s>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="11"> "On the cosmic scale of things, that was a close call," said Dr. Henry Holt, an amateur astronomer from Flagstaff, Ariz., who discovered the asteroid while working on a NASA project.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA042089-0083" num="12"> Bevan French, a scientist with NASA's solar system exploration division, said if the asteroid had collided with Earth the impact would have been equivalent to the explosion of 20,000 hydrogen bombs and would have created a crater at least 5 miles across -- or "enough to destroy a good-sized city".</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="10"> Giant "blobs" of material have been discovered around a mysterious object near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, leading scientists to believe they may be getting their best look yet at one of the most baffling objects in the universe -- a black hole.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="11"> It isn't possible to actually see a black hole, and no one has been able to prove that they exist, because a black hole would be so dense that even light would not escape its gravity.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="12"> But black holes exist in theory -- and probably in fact -- as part of the legacy of Albert Einstein.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="13"> Despite years of searching, they remain the most elusive trophies in the astronomical zoo.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="14"> But armed with increasingly powerful tools, including giant radio telescopes, scientists believe that they are getting closer to proving that black holes do exist, even if they cannot be seen.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="15"> The search consists mainly of looking for evidence of the kind of violent activity that should take place in a black hole's immediate neighborhood.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="16"> Theoretically, as the black hole captures material within its gravitational reach, atoms and molecules literally should be ripped apart, sending out various types of radiation that can be studied from as far away as Earth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="17"> Wednesday, scientists told the American Astronomical Society meeting here that they believe that they have identified a series of giant "blobs" -- most likely clouds of hot, charged gas particles -- around an object known as Sagittarius A, which had been discovered previously by an infrared telescope.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="18"> The "blobs," they said, were probably created when matter was ripped apart as it plunged toward the black hole.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="19"> Each of the giant blobs measures nearly a trillion miles in diameter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="20"> They hope that additional study will unmask Sagittarius A and prove it to be the long-sought but never seen black hole that scientists suspect lurks at the heart of the Milky Way Galaxy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="21"> The research is being carried out by Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., Mark Morris of UCLA and Ron Ekers of the Australian Telescope.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="22"> Their main tool in the search for the black hole is the Very Large Array, a series of large radio telescopes in the New Mexico desert.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="23"> "This is the first time we have seen these blobs," Yusef-Zadeh said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="24"> Yusef-Zadeh said he cannot tell yet if the blobs are being pulled toward Sagittarius A or blown away by hot gases similar to the solar wind.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="25"> But he is confident that the research he presented Wednesday goes a long way toward proving that a black hole does lie at the center of any galaxy, and in our own Milky Way, the most likely candidate is Sagittarius A.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="26"> One problem that has been particularly vexing for astronomers is that the central area of the galaxy is so clouded with dust and gas that it is not possible to see objects near the galactic center.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="27"> Thus observations are limited primarily to radiation that can pass through the dusty shield, such as radio waves and X-rays.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="28"> So for the last few years, scientists have used giant radio telescopes to study the galactic center, and their search for the black hole has been generally narrowed to two objects.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="29"> One is a tight cluster of stars, called IRS 16, and the other is Sagittarius A.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="30"> Yusef-Zadeh presented evidence Wednesday that he said strongly supports Sagittarius as the prime candidate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="31"> The most compelling evidence in addition to the blobs, he said, is a cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a nearby star, called IRS 7.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="32"> "'Radiographs," which are similar to photographs, produced by the scientists show that the cloud of dust is being swept past the star much the same as the tail of a comet is pushed back by the solar wind.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="33"> The cloud is pointing directly away from Sagittarius A, just as the tail of a comet points away from the sun.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="34"> That indicates that powerful interstellar winds -- such as those expected to be produced by a very energetic object such as a black hole -- are in fact coming from Sagittarius A.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="35"> That clearly suggests that Sagittarius is the black hole that scientists have been looking for, Yusef-Zadeh said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="36"> The scientists, who are at the forefront in the search for a black hole at the center of the Milky Way, have been alloted time on an even larger radio telescope, called the Very Large Baseline Array, which is under construction in New Mexico.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0072" num="37"> Yusef-Zadeh said he hopes that powerful instrument, which actually will consist of many telescopes linked together so that they will act as one, will finally resolve the issue.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="6"> Progress towards answering the biggest questions in science - about the origins and future of the universe - depends ultimately on a partnership between scientists working on unimaginably different scales of time and distance.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="7"> Astronomers and cosmologists are observing and trying to understand events that occurred billions of years ago and billions of light years away; at the other extreme, particle physicists are investigating collisions lasting billionths of a second on a scale of billionths of a millimetre.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="8"> But the two types of scientist enter 1994 in very different moods.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="9"> Cosmologists are in a frenzy of excitement, fed by observations from space and from ground-based instruments, as they weave new theories about the cosmic boom that brought the universe into existence 15bn years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="10"> Their sense of anticipation is heightened by last month's repair of the Hubble telescope, which will enable astronomers to see further into space.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="11"> Particle physicists, in contrast, are mourning a terrestrial bust.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="12"> Pressure from congressional budget cutters forced the US to cancel what would have been their most powerful instrument - the Dollars 10bn Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) - after spending Dollars 2bn digging the first section of its 85 km tunnel beneath the plains of Texas.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="13"> October's SSC cancellation not only deprives physicists of a means of smashing together elementary particles at energies high enough to mimic, on a microscopic scale, conditions soon after the Big Bang.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="14"> It also shows that they can no longer count on the US, the world's chief paymaster for big science projects for the past two generations, to fund ever more expensive machines to delve deeper and deeper into the nature of matter.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="15"> Instead they have to rely on Europe's more cautious governments - and in particular on Cern, the 19-nation particle physics laboratory outside Geneva.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="16"> This year Cern members must decide whether to pick up the baton and build a new accelerator.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="17"> Cern's proposed Large Hadron Collider is relatively cheap, with an estimated price not much above Pounds 1bn.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="18"> That is partly because LHC would be smaller than SSC but mainly because it does not need a new tunnel; it can share the 27 km loop housing Cern's current accelerator, LEP.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="19"> Whereas LEP smashes together light electrons and positrons LHC will collide protons - relatively heavy particles - at virtually the speed of light.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="20"> Christopher Llewellyn Smith, the Oxford physicist who takes over as Cern director-general today, estimates that LHC would cost Pounds 4bn to build from scratch.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="21"> Most observers believe that European science ministers will agree to fund LHC at the bargain price, though construction may be delayed by attempts to negotiate some US participation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="22"> LHC collisions will release more energy - within an extremely confined space -than any previous events on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="23"> Some of this should manifest itself in the form of subatomic particles last generated in the first moments of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="24"> Most eagerly anticipated is the 'Higgs boson', the particle believed to give all matter its mass.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="25"> While particle physicists try to recreate conditions of the Big Bang on earth, astronomers and cosmologists look for direct evidence of its aftermath in the skies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="26"> Fortunately they have a much wider choice of instruments and greater diversity of data.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="27"> No single event, even the loss of the Hubble space telescope, could have such a devastating effect on astronomy as the SSC cancellation did on particle physics.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="28"> Take, for example, the momentous announcement in April 1992 that the US Cosmic Background Explorer satellite had detected 'cosmic ripples' of microwave radiation from the young universe - the first signs of the unevenness which gravity later pulled into clusters of galaxies and stars.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="29"> Since then the observation has been confirmed and extended by several other instruments, operating from the ground and from high-altitude balloons as well as from space.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="30"> If Cobe had failed, the ripples would still have been discovered.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="31"> Besides consolidating the position of the Big Bang in cosmology the ripples have helped to support some specific theories about the development and structure of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="32"> They fit well with the 'inflationary' model, which postulates a super-expansionary burst immediately after the Big Bang; random fluctuations during this period, lasting less than one billion billion billionth of a second, sowed the seeds of unevenness.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="33"> The observations are also consistent with a universe precisely balanced between being 'closed' and 'open'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="34"> If so, it would contain exactly the right amount of matter for gravity to stop the universe expanding, after an infinite period of time, but not enough to pull everything back together again eventually in a Big Crunch.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="35"> Such a universe, with a 'critical density of one', appeals strongly to cosmologists' yearning for mathematical neatness.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="36"> One practical consequence is that the universe must contain a vast amount of 'missing mass' - 10 to 100 times more than all the visible objects (galaxies, stars, dust clouds, quasars and so on) observed so far.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="37"> Perhaps the greatest astronomical priority for 1994 will be to investigate the nature of this 'dark matter'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17652" num="38"> Candidates include: ordinary matter in the form of planet-sized Massive Compact Halo Objects; billions of small black holes; slow-moving and virtually undetectable Weakly Interacting Massive Particles; and neutrinos moving at virtually the speed of light.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="6"> The Hubble Space Telescope - previously derided as a Dollars 2.5bn white elephant in orbit - is redeeming its reputation in spectacular fashion.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="7"> The images sent back this year, after astronauts repaired the telescope's defective mirror, show a myriad of astronomical objects too distant to be seen with the most powerful Earth-bound observatories.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="8"> Hubble's latest observations have thrown cosmologists into a spin, because they appear to contradict the leading theory for the origin and development of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="9"> Most troubling is their implication that the universe is only 8bn years old, when many astronomers are confident from other evidence that the oldest stars have been shining for about 15bn years.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="10"> Of course the universe cannot be younger than the stars in it.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="11"> So, if further observations confirm these findings, cosmologists will have to change their views of the universe's birth in a cosmic fireball - the Big Bang - and its subsequent expansion.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="12"> The basic idea of the Big Bang - that everything has grown from an infinitely small point containing an unimaginably large amount of energy - is not under serious threat.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="13"> But other popular concepts of contemporary cosmology may not survive.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="14"> One is the 'flat universe' containing just enough matter for gravity eventually to stop it expanding but too little to pull everything back together again in a Big Crunch.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="15"> The latest Hubble observations are likely to revive support for the less dense 'open universe' model, in which things will fly apart rapidly for ever.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="16"> They may even tempt scientists to reconsider the idea, originally put forward by Albert Einstein, of a 'cosmological constant'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="17"> This is a fudge factor, hated and rejected by most cosmologists because they cannot give it any theoretical foundation, which would counteract the force of gravity and push the universe apart more rapidly with time.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="18"> The Hubble observations are the first phase of an international programme to assess the scale, size and age of the universe with the space telescope.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="19"> The research team found 20 individual stars of a type called Cepheid variables in the distant M100 galaxy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="20"> Astronomers use such stars as 'standard candles' for measuring interstellar distances, because they pulsate with a frequency that depends directly on their intrinsic brightness.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="21"> By comparing this absolute brightness with the star's apparent brightness when seen from Earth, the astronomers can estimate its distance - 56m light-years in the case of the M100 galaxy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="22"> They combine this figure with the star's 'red shift', which shows how fast it is moving away from us, to calculate Hubble's Constant, the rate at which the universe is expanding.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="23"> Finally, to estimate the universe's age, they must adjust the rate for any deceleration or acceleration since its formation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="24"> The age of 8bn years is derived from the observations by standard cosmological theory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="25"> It can be pushed back by another 3bn years by giving the universe a very low density (though this might contradict other astronomical observations).</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="26"> But an age of 15bn years to match the oldest stars would require an accelerating force - Einstein's dreaded cosmological constant.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="27"> Scientists have reacted very cautiously to the findings, published at the end of October in the journal Nature - so cautiously that Nature attacked their silence in an editorial a month later.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="28"> 'Cosmologists had better say something,' the journal said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="29"> However, cosmologists themselves say they are waiting for more Hubble observations, using 'standard candles' in other distant galaxies, to confirm the first results and reduce their margin of error.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="30"> 'Within a year or two, we ought to have a more definite measurement,' says Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University, Britain's new Astronomer-Royal.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="31"> 'If it turns out that there is still a big discrepancy with the age of the oldest stars, then cosmologists will have problems maintaining their standard theory of the universe'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="32"> The universe's age is the most controversial issue addressed so far with the Hubble telescope.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="33"> But the bus-sized instrument has taken many more spectacular pictures through its new corrective lenses.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="34"> Some of the best shots, released this month by the US space agency Nasa, show parts of the universe billions of light years away - and therefore billions of years in the past.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="35"> They reveal for the first time the shape of galaxies emerging in the young universe.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="36"> 'There is a menagerie of strange objects that have no counterpart in today's universe,' said Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="37"> Most of the stars are arranged in disorganised groups that look like torn fragments of present-day spiral galaxies but may in fact be their precursors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="38"> Confusingly, mature elliptical galaxies also seem to have existed within 2bn years of the Big Bang, very similar to today's.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="39"> Although it is far too soon for cosmologists to have made sense of the primeval galactic menagerie, this new evidence suggests that galaxies started to form very early in the life of the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="40"> If so, it will lend more support to the idea of a low-density open universe with a less even distribution of matter than the popular 'flat universe' model.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="41"> Yet another fragment of Hubble evidence in favour of a an ever expanding universe came in November, when astronomers published the results of a search for small dim stars, too faint to be seen from Earth, which they thought might make up some of the universe's 'missing mass'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="42"> They found far fewer than expected.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="43"> Unless a space gremlin strikes, Hubble will provide another stunning set of observations during 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT944-128" num="44"> The age of the universe should be clearer a year from now, but the telescope will probably have thrown up another conundrum by then to silence the cosmologists.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="9"> Imagine seeing the full complexity of a movie like "Lawrence of Arabia" when all you had previously seen was a 60-second trailer, or the vibrant detail to be gained from studying a Matisse painting when all you had previously seen was a black-and-white print.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="10"> Roughly speaking, that is the kind of improvement astronomers hope to gain this Wednesday at 12:40 a.m. when the space shuttle Columbia carries the $150-million Astro observatory into orbit.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="11"> The three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope aboard the shuttle will afford astronomers an unprecedented view of the universe in a broad range of wavelengths that hitherto have been largely inaccessible, blocked from ground-based telescopes by the absorbing power of the atmosphere.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="12"> In a mission of unusual ambition and complexity, and the first ever to be devoted to a single scientific discipline, the seven-man crew of Columbia -- which includes five astrophysicists -- and their counterparts on Earth will work around the clock for 10 days, taking as many as 300 pictures with each instrument before packing them up and bringing them home.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="13"> The mission is a sharp contrast to the recent flight of the shuttle Discovery, which five weeks ago launched the Hubble Space Telescope.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="14"> Hubble will view the stars in great detail for the next 15 years, and the differences between it and Astro have sparked a strong rivalry between the crews of the two shuttles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="15"> "We get to be astronomers," said Astro mission specialist Jeffrey A. Hoffman.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="16"> "All they (the Discovery crew) do is throw out a telescope.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="17"> Anybody can do that".</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="18"> Added mission specialist Robert A.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="19"> R. Parker: "We'll be sending down science data while (the) space telescope is still doing engineering checkout".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="20"> The Hubble and Astro telescopes differ from each other in much the same manner as a spyglass does from binoculars.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="21"> Hubble is designed to look at very narrow regions of space at very high resolution.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="22"> Astro is meant to study much broader regions, but with less resolution.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="23"> The Astro telescopes also observe at a variety of wavelengths to which Hubble is blind.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="24"> During the 10-day mission, astronomers will study a variety of celestial objects ranging from planets and moons in the outer solar system to Supernova 1987a -- an exploding star, located about 160,000 light-years from Earth, that was first detected in January 1987; from nearby "starburst" galaxies that have an unusually high rate of star formation, to distant quasars that are the oldest and brightest objects known.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="25"> They will also get their first look at large portions of the sky that have never been viewed in either ultraviolet or X-ray wavelengths because of the atmosphere, and they may even see the first direct evidence for the existence of black holes -- those mysterious and elusive collapsed stars that are so heavy and dense that not even light can escape their intense gravitational pull.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="26"> "Each of the instruments is designed to do something that no other existing telescope or spacecraft can do," said astronomer Stephen P.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="27"> Maran of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="28"> "It's going to provide an important source of knowledge about what goes on in space".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="29"> In their leftover time, the Columbia crew will teach a science lesson from space that will be beamed by satellite to high schools around the country.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="30"> And payload specialist Ronald A.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="31"> Parise will attempt to make ham radio contact with Soviet cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir -- perhaps to commiserate with the cosmonauts on their need to repair some insulation before returning to Earth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="32"> Each of the four telescopes, to be mounted on pallets in the payload bay of Columbia, has its own mission to perform, although their roles are complementary.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="33"> In fact, the three ultraviolet telescopes will be operated in unison to provide different pictures of the same celestial objects.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="34"> The X-ray telescope will be operated independently of the other three; sometimes it will photograph the same stars as the ultraviolet telescopes, other times it will photograph other objects.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="35"> The largest of the telescopes is the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope or HUT, designed by astronomer Arthur F.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="36"> Davidsen and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="37"> It has a 36-inch mirror coated with the rare metal iridium to allow it to reflect an unusually broad spectrum of ultraviolet frequencies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="38"> HUT also has an exceptionally sensitive electronic detector coated with cesium iodide, which allows it to "see" incoming ultraviolet photons.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="39"> This detector must never come in contact with normal air -- especially water vapor -- because that would destroy its ultraviolet sensitivity.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="40"> High-efficiency vacuum pumps must be used to keep it in a near-vacuum continuously, except for brief transition periods in a dry nitrogen atmosphere.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="41"> "One of the most challenging and significant projects" for HUT will be the search for helium in the intergalactic medium, Davidsen said.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="42"> When the universe was formed in the Big Bang, astrophysicists believe, its principal components were hydrogen and helium.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="43"> "It's that primordial hydrogen and helium, out of which everything else came, that we would like to detect directly," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="44"> Helium absorbs light at ultraviolet wavelengths detectable only by HUT.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="45"> "Either we will detect it, or we will set a very stringent limit" on the amount of matter that can be present in intergalactic space, Davidsen said.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="46"> The question of how much invisible matter is present in the "vacuum" of space is a crucial one because it determines whether the universe will eventually collapse in on itself or expand forever.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="47"> The next largest telescope, with a 15-inch mirror, is the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope or UIT, designed and built by astronomer Theodore P.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="48"> Stecher and his colleagues at Goddard.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="49"> It is the only one of the four instruments that will not produce data during the Columbia flight.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="50"> Instead, it carries enough film to make 2,000 exposures during the flight.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="51"> The photos will be developed after Astro is returned to Earth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="52"> UIT has the largest field of view of any ultraviolet telescope ever built.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="53"> It "covers a vastly larger piece of the sky" than Hubble, Maran said, and thus can be used to discover new objects that will be studied in detail by Hubble.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="54"> Unlike Hubble, which responds to both visible and ultraviolet light, UIT responds only to ultraviolet light.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="55"> "When you look at a globular star cluster in visible light, it is dominated by the red giant stars," Maran said.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="56"> "But they all drop away in the ultraviolet, so you can look and discover large numbers of white dwarfs, which are shrunken down and quite hot".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="57"> UIT will also be used to search for an "ultraviolet light echo" of the explosion that created Supernova 1987a.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="58"> According to conventional theory, the ultraviolet light output of the supernova should have peaked just hours after the original explosion, while the output of visible light peaked 85 days later.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="59"> Both light peaks should cause "echoes" when the bright light is reflected by interstellar dust and bounced back to Earth, appearing in telescopes as faint and ever-enlarging circles surrounding the supernova.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="60"> One astronomer, Arlen Crotts, has already discovered the visible light echoes, and researchers hope to observe the ultraviolet light echoes with UIT.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="61"> By comparing the intensities of the light in the two wavelengths, researchers should be able to determine the microscopic composition of the dust grains and their arrangement in the clouds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="62"> The properties of interstellar dust are also the focus of the third ultraviolet telescope, the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment, also known as WUPPE, which has a 20-inch mirror.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="63"> It was designed and built by astronomer Arthur D.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="64"> Code and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="65"> It will observe polarized ultraviolet light, which has been virtually unstudied.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="66"> Normally, the electromagnetic radiation that is light vibrates uniformly in all directions, like the pistons on an old-fashioned radial airplane engine.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="67"> Polarized light, in contrast, vibrates preferentially in one direction like the pistons in a four-cylinder automobile.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="68"> Although ultraviolet light is not normally polarized, it can be polarized by passing through strong electric fields or by interaction with interstellar dust.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="69"> Studying its polarity will thus reveal a great deal about the magnetic fields of other stars and about the composition of interstellar gases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="70"> The fourth and final telescope is the Broad Band X-Ray Telescope or BBXRT, designed and built by Peter J.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="71"> Serlemitsos and his colleagues at Goddard.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="72"> It has an unusual new design.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="73"> X-rays are not reflected by mirrors in the same way as normal light.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="74"> Instead, they are reflected only when they strike the mirror at a very shallow angle.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="75"> Hence, conventional X-ray telescopes use very large, highly polished metal mirrors that, in fact, have only a very small effective X-ray collecting area.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="76"> Serlemitsos developed a design in which literally hundreds of very thin sheets of gold-coated aluminum foil can be nestled close together to reflect an unusually large proportion of the X-rays entering the telescope, making possible unusual X-ray gathering power.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="77"> One prime target of BBXRT will be Supernova 1987a.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="78"> Researchers hope it will provide the first firm evidence of the existence of the neutron star that most astronomers are sure must be at its center.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="79"> Visible and ultraviolet light from the neutron star are scattered by the large amount of debris around it, but X-rays should easily pass through.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="80"> "All the heavy elements in the universe have been formed in such explosions," Serlemitsos said.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="81"> "If we can trace the amounts and distribution of the heavy elements (in the supernova), we can start putting together good models of how heavy elements are built".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="82"> To maximize their viewing time in orbit, the astronauts will be divided into two teams, Red and Blue, which will work 12-hour shifts each.</s>

<s docid="LA052890-0021" num="83"> When the Red team is on duty, Columbia pilot Guy S. Gardner, 42, will fly the shuttle to point the payload bay in the direction from which observations will be made, mission specialist Parker, 53, will operate the aiming system for the ultraviolet telescopes and payload specialist Parise, 38, will operate the telescopes themselves.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="10"> SUPPOSE YOU are staying in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and you want to get to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="11"> It is simple.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="12"> You drive south, then east, then south and then east again on to the Santa Monica freeway.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="13"> As it is the rush hour, the traffic buzzes angrily.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="14"> You peek at other drivers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="15"> Boy, have they got problems; they're probably in therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="16"> But you, you're doing fine, because you have now sort of drifted across five lanes of traffic and have somehow turned north on to the Pasadena freeway.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="17"> As you wheel along, you fiddle with the radio 'Seek' button, flicking from station to station, hundreds of them, seemingly, pumping out pop, rock, rap; bulletins and news flashes; rapes and serial killings; messages from our sponsor; dog food and vitamin pills; Tums, Skippy, Tylenol - uproar, babeldom.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="18"> As it happens, radio and TV signals broadcast on Earth are also transmitted into space at the speed of light.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="19"> The earliest TV transmissions from Earth have travelled more than 40 light years, or ten times further than Alpha Centauri, our own sun's nearest neighbour.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="20"> This radio, radar and TV leakage of ours now fills a sphere more than 80 light years in diameter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="21"> (A light year is the distance light travels in one year: about 6 trillion miles).</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="22"> In addition, we have sent into space a few intentional messages, such as that broadcast in 1974 at the rededication of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="23"> The message included descriptions of our solar system, the elements important to Earthly life and the structure of the DNA molecule.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="24"> We beamed that message in the direction of the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years away.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="25"> Which is all fine and good.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="26"> But what about incoming messages?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="27"> Are we ready to receive, as well as transmit?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="28"> After all, our own Milky Way galaxy contains an estimated 300bn-400bn stars.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="29"> And with each passing year, estimates of the probability of intelligent life on far-flung planets increase.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="30"> In the view of many scientists on Earth, we are within reach of one of the key steps in our evolution - knowledge of the existence, nature and activities of independent civilisations in space.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="31"> Are we ready for incoming calls?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="32"> The answer is Yes: we are about to start serious eavesdropping.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="33"> On October 12, Columbus Day, Nasa will launch its ten-year, Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or Seti programme - a systematic search of the microwave radio spectrum for signals of intelligent origin.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="34"> Seti is a joint venture between Nasa's Ames Research Centre and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="35"> As such, it is part of one of the seven areas of Nasa research recommended by the National Commission on Space in 1986: 'A continuing programme to search for evidence that life exists - or has existed - beyond Earth, by studying other bodies of the solar system, by searching for planets circling other stars, and by searching for signals broadcast by intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="36"> Naturally, the launch of Nasa's Seti programme will prove a lodestar for jesters, cynics and two-bit comedians, the banality of whose jokes - 'I was on my way to Venus when all of a sudden . . '.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="37"> - will be as predictable as the Flat Earth witticisms that reverberated in Columbus's ears when he set sail for America 500 years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="38"> BIOASTRONOMY - the study of life in the universe, and the search for evidence of intelligence - is now so respectable that it is almost strait-laced.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="39"> A few generations ago, astronomers believed that planetary systems were extremely rare; that the Earth's ability to support life was possibly unique.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="40"> In the last two decades, however, advances in astronomy and physics have supported the idea that planets are not rare but a natural part of the star-formation process, and may number in the hundreds of billions in our galaxy alone.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="41"> As a result, in 1990 the US Congress voted funds for Nasa to design and build special digital processing systems capable of searching tens of millions of radio channels.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="42"> Is anyone out there?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="43"> In the editors' foreword to the account of proceedings at the Third International Symposium on Bioastronomy in Savoie, France, in June 1990, the complex trail of cosmic evolution is described in five stages: First, the appearance of matter soon after Big Bang, leading to the formation of stars and planets several billion years later and continuing with the synthesis of chemical elements like carbon; Second, formation of the first organic molecules; these molecules have been discovered in interstellar space by radio-astronomers and in comets by space probes; Third, a prebiotic chemistry stage in which complex building blocks are produced, such as nitric bases that form the rungs of the DNA double helix ladder; some theories predict that a prebiotic chemistry could be proceeding even now on Titan, the large moon of the planet Saturn; Fourth, a primitive biological stage like the one of bacteria which dominated the Earth's first few billion years; scientists hope to discover this form of biological activity, perhaps in a different form, buried in the permafrost of Mars; Fifth, 'advanced' life, perhaps more advanced than ours.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="44"> Nothing - so far - indicates that Homo sapiens are unique in the universe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="45"> To quote Nasa: 'One direct way of testing whether intelligent life exists beyond our solar system is to search for an artificially generated radio signal coming from interstellar space.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="46"> Advanced civilisations might be operating radio beacons, possibly to attract the attention of emerging societies and bring them into contact with a community of long-established intelligent societies existing throughout the galaxy'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="47"> To detect either type of signal - beacon or leakage - it makes great sense to look at frequencies where background radio noise is minimal.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="48"> 'One of the quietest regions of the electromagnetic spectrum', says Nasa, 'is the 'microwave window' that lies in the frequency band between 1,000 and 10,000 megahertz (MHz).</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="49"> It is reasonable to assume that others wishing to establish interstellar contact by radio might choose this band'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="50"> SO OFF WE GO, though not for the first time.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="51"> The first serious proposal for using radio waves to transmit information over interstellar distances was suggested by physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi in Nature in 1959.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="52"> Since then, more than 50 searches have been conducted by dozens of astronomers in at least eight countries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="53"> These were primitive efforts, using equipment designed for other purposes and limited in duration, sensitivity, number of channels, types of signals and numbers of stars observed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="54"> In spite of these limitations, most of those searches found unexplained signals.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="55"> What is new about the Seti programme starting on October 12, says Nasa, is the technology now available.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="56"> Existing radio telescopes on Earth are sensitive enough to detect, at distances of 1,000 light years or more, signals no more powerful than some now leaving Earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="57"> In addition, advances in data processing make it possible to sift automatically through millions of frequency channels each second and, if present, identify signals transmitted by intelligent societies.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="58"> The Seti plan involves two complementary modes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="59"> First, there will be an all-sky search covering nearly 500m channels in the 1,000-10,000 MHz range, plus spot bands up to 25,000 MHz, using the 34-metre antennas of Nasa's Deep Space Network.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="60"> This sky search will cover at least 10,000 times more frequency space than all previous survey attempts and will be about 300 times more sensitive.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="61"> Second, a special targeted search using the largest available radio telescopes (including Arecibo) will examine nearly 800 sun-like stars within 100 light years of Earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="62"> Some stellar clusters and nearby galaxies will also be observed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="63"> This targeted search will examine 2bn channels over a frequency range of 1,000-3,000 MHz, plus higher spot bands.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="64"> Would we recognise an intelligent signal?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="65"> Quite easily, apparently.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="66"> Would Nasa tell us if it did detect a signal?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="67"> You will not catch Nasa out like that.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="68"> 'Once a signal is confirmed as being of ETI origin, an announcement of the discovery would be made as quickly and as widely as possible', it claims.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="69"> 'One way in which the announcement could be made is described in a Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="70"> Would we know what the signal meant?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="71"> Apparently we would.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="72"> If intentional, the signal will be anticryptographic - easy to decode.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="73"> A civilisation bent on sending messages would probably employ simple tutorial pictures and use an interstellar Esperanto based on universal physical and mathematical principles.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="74"> Conversely, a civilisation's own domestic output - Neighbours of M13, News At Sixty - may be difficult to decipher.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="75"> Would senders know their messages had been received?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="76"> No, not unless we replied.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="77"> Nasa itself has no plan for replying.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="78"> As part of the International Seti Post-Detection Protocol now under consideration, it would be up to the nations of Earth whether, and how, to reply.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="79"> How much will the Seti project cost?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="80"> The cost for a ten-year period is described as averaging Dollars 10m a year, or less than 0.1 per cent of Nasa's budget - 'less', it claims winsomely, 'than a nickel per American per year'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="81"> Against a background of ballooning US federal budget deficits and the spectre of US poverty, Nasa has become as skilled as any institution in fighting its corner and defending its plans.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="82"> Even if no signal from space is detected, it says the technology developed to search for faint signals from distant planets can be applied to more down-to-Earth problems in medical diagnostic imaging, resource exploration, aircraft safety and electronics.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="83"> It will also yield uniquely detailed astronomical data and have useful spin-offs in education.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="84"> But if a signal was detected, why then: 'Information gathered from other civilisations may provide important practical as well as social and philosophical benefits'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="85"> HOWEVER MANY times Nasa says that Seti has nothing to do with UFO detection or little green men, it knows it cannot stanch the jokes among the unsophisticated.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="86"> In Washington, one politician railed against Seti's 1990-91 budget like this: 'Of course there are flying saucers and advanced civilisations in outer space.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="87"> But we don't need to spend Dollars 6m to find evidence of these rascally creatures.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="88"> We only need 75 cents to buy a tabloid at the local supermarket'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="89"> When I finally reached the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, north of Pasadena, I was asked at the reception desk for photographic ID, plus my 'resident alien's card'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="90"> I explained that I was not a resident alien, merely an alien.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="91"> A little later, I described this exchange to Dr Michael J Klein, Seti's project manager at the JPL, who laughed quite cheerfully, just as Columbus must have laughed till his face ached while supervising the provisioning of his ships.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="92"> Klein's equivalent of provisioning is moving equipment into California's Mojave desert and supervising numerous other tasks while trying to ward off budget cuts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="93"> 'We are not talking about little green men or space travel', he told me.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="94"> 'This is not scientific fantasy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="95"> Seti is a search.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="96"> We are not transmitting.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="97"> Somebody else will do that.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="99"> It may not be a 28th century possibility, but at least we now have the means to listen for sounds of other technologies.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="100"> It's a bit like cutting an acre of grass.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="101"> To date, we've used nail-clippers; now we've got a lawnmower.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="103"> People disagree on the chances of success, but everybody agrees that it should be done: there is good science coming out of it'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="105"> 'Do I believe in a supreme God?</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="106"> Yes, I do.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="108"> I believe in a Creator who established the laws of physics'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="109"> And - for the record - yes, Klein does expect that one day Earth will detect an intelligent signal from somewhere in the Milky Way.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="110"> 'My guess is that such a signal will be detected at a distance much greater than ten light years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="111"> I would guess 100 or more.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="112"> Most of us who work on Seti believe that some day there will be contact via communication - not space travel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-13455" num="113"> There won't be dialogue because of the time lags involved, though there may one day be dialogue between generations.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="10"> In recent years, scientists have been baffled by the discovery of huge bubbles in the universe that seem to be devoid of matter and by giant walls of galaxies that stretch on for hundreds of millions of light-years.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="11"> No one could determine what mysterious forces would have created such giant structures.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="12"> Some theorists have suggested that massive explosions might have swept some areas clean, creating the bubbles and pushing matter together to form great walls of galaxies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="13"> But scientists at Princeton University believe they now have the answer.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="14"> Aided by a powerful computer, they have concluded that nothing more than gravity was needed to form the great structures that astronomers are now finding throughout the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="15"> "There was no violent pumping of energy into the early universe" to create the features, astrophysicist J. Richard Gott said in a telephone interview.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="16"> He said research he has conducted with his graduate student, Changbom Park, shows that gravity, acting on very slight fluctuations in the distribution of matter a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, would account for the great structures now seen in the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="17"> "Gravity works very quietly," Gott said.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="18"> "It just takes time".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="19"> The finding could prove anticlimactic for scientists who have searched for an exotic explanation for the huge voids, which have tantalized the world of astronomy ever since they were discovered four years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="20"> The discovery of the bubbles was hailed literally around the world by the popular press as well as scientific journals because it suggested that something terribly mysterious had happened in the earliest universe, creating giant structures that staggered the imagination.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="21"> But if the Princeton team is correct, it was nothing more than the normal functioning of one of the four fundamental forces of nature.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="22"> During the lifetime of the universe, simple gravity would have caused small pockets of matter to accumulate other particles, growing into stars and clusters of stars and even great walls of galaxies such as one discovered last year that is more than half a billion light-years long.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="23"> By simulating the accretion of matter over the lifetime of the universe, Gott and Park have created computer images that are remarkably similar to observational data from astronomers in the field.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="24"> Their work is being published today in the British scientific journal of the Royal Astronomical Society.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="25"> At stake is the credibility of the basic cosmological models that theorists have used for years to comprehend the universe.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="26"> Gott's findings fit nicely with current theories.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="27"> If he is wrong, theorists will have to come up with a new explanation for why a universe that began as a tightly compacted -- and presumably homogeneous -- primordial soup would have led to the development of such irregular structures as scientists are now finding.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="28"> Other scientists who are using computers to try to simulate the evolution of the universe tend to grant the Princeton research considerable credibility, but not everyone is convinced.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="29"> "I retain some healthy skepticism," said astrophysicist Margaret Geller, who along with John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge discovered the "bubbles" several years ago and the "Great Wall" of galaxies announced last November.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="30"> Geller said in a telephone interview that she had seen some of Gott's earlier work and she does not think the images emerging from his computer match the observational data.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="31"> Edmund Bertschinger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has carried out research similar to Gott's but on a smaller scale, also remains a little skeptical but believes the great mystery may well be much closer to being resolved.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="32"> "It (the Princeton work) should be treated as preliminary because nobody else has done a simulation this large," Bertschinger said.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="33"> "But it's interesting work and it suggests that gravity is capable of making more complicated structures than we had thought".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="34"> Gott insisted that his findings also fit nicely with the first results from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), a spacecraft launched in November to study the background radiation left over from the Big Bang.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="35"> One of the things COBE is looking for is evidence of cataclysmic events like energy-releasing explosions that could have swept particles from the Big Bang into tighter formations, leading eventually to the formation of such things as galaxies.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="36"> The first results from COBE, released in mid-January, showed no trace of such events.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="42"> That wasn't necessary, Gott said this week, because his research shows that gravity alone could have led to the formation of structures like the Great Wall.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="43"> "I was not at all surprised by COBE," he said.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="45"> Gott's research is based on the assumption that even in the earliest universe there would have been some slight fluctuation in the concentration of matter.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="46"> At least one part in every 200,000 should have been a little different, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="47"> "These (fluctuations) led to density fluctuations that can start to grow and they keep growing" because some areas would have slightly higher mass -- and thus stronger gravitational pull -- than others," Gott said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="48"> Gott and Park used the Princeton computer to simulate what would have happened if the earliest universe had had even slight fluctuations in density.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="49"> The computer was told to simulate the effect of gravity on 4 million particles over a slice of the universe 2 billion light-years across.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="50"> The data included slight fluctuations in density, and the computer was programmed to follow the evolution of the particles for the equivalent of 13 billion years.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="51"> It took the computer 14 hours to complete the task.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="52"> By the time the simulated universe had reached the theoretical age of today's universe, the computer was spitting out images that Gott says "look astonishingly like the observations" of Geller and Huchra.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="53"> While the Princeton findings are not as exotic as some theories offered by other cosmologists, the end result is "wonderful," Gott said.</s>

<s docid="LA020190-0053" num="54"> "It means these superclusters (of galaxies) are fossil remnants of the pattern of fluctuations that existed in the early universe," he said.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="6"> Four European science organisations are joining forces to put on Cosmorama, a touring exhibition which will visit 20 countries over four years from 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="7"> 'Our aim is to represent in one single exhibition man's present knowledge of the universe,' says Brian Southworth of Cern, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, who is chairman of the organising committee.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="8"> 'We want to show all our delight at the things we already know and all the mystery of the things we do not yet know'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="9"> Cosmorama will contain large animated displays - Inside the Big Bang, Inside the Milky Way, Inside the Solar System and Inside the Living Cell - to represent the work of the four organisations: Cern, ESO (European Southern Observatory), ESA (European Space Agency) and EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory).</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="10"> There will also be operating scientific instruments, including spark chambers to reveal the cosmic rays irradiating the earth.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="11"> 'But we are making the presentation of the laboratories themselves secondary to the overall scientific aim of the exhibition,' Southworth says.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="12"> Nigel Calder, a well-known British science writer, has written the storyline to knit everything together.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="13"> Visitors will be directed around the exhibition in their local language, with Calder's commentary transmitted by infra-red to individual headsets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="14"> The budget for the exhibition and its touring expenses will be about Pounds 2m, which the organisers hope to raise mainly from corporate sponsors.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="15"> The 20 host cities will spend an extra Pounds 2.5m to meet local costs.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="16"> Cosmorama's tour is scheduled to start at the Heureka Science Centre near Helsinki in March 1993 and finish in Moscow four years later.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="17"> Its UK visit - to Birmingham - will be in mid-1994.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="18"> Three 13-metre vehicles, nicknamed the Spacetrain, will move it from city to city.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="19"> The exhibition will spend six weeks at each venue and will be updated continuously to feature new discoveries - for example a comet founded by ESO astronomers or a genetic discovery at EMBL.</s>

<s docid="FT921-830" num="20"> The organisers estimate that 1.5m people will visit the show.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="8"> Two of the most esoteric fields of science are joining in a marriage that could help determine whether the universe will go on expanding forever or ultimately collapse on itself in a final big bang.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="9"> Physicists who are building a new generation of multimillion-dollar instruments to detect gravity waves are joining with astronomers who are trying to measure what may be immeasurable -- a subatomic particle so small it defies imagination, but so numerous that if it has even a little mass it may well determine the future of the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="10"> The marriage of these two very different fields could produce quality data that "we can really believe in," said UCLA professor David Cline, the prime mover behind the program.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="11"> Most of the universe is believed to be made up of mysterious "hidden matter" that cannot be seen.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="12"> Cosmologists speculate that if there is enough hidden matter, the force of gravity will be so great that the universe eventually will stop expanding and finally collapse.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="13"> But what could be massive enough to cause the universe to ultimately contract, and yet still remain invisible?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="14"> Some theorists believe the answer might lie in neutrinos, which are manufactured continuously when stars like the sun burn their fuel.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="15"> Neutrinos are also created in great bursts when stars explode or collide.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="16"> It was, in fact, just such an explosion that brought several dozen experts to Los Angeles last week for a symposium hosted by UCLA.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="17"> Discover Supernova</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="18"> Two years ago, an exploding star, called a supernova, was discovered in the southern sky, and it was the brightest supernova seen in 400 years, according to historical records.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="19"> The discovery sent astronomers around the world scrambling for their instruments to witness one of nature's most spectacular shows, and it has spawned several major new areas of research because a supernova is one of nature's rarest laboratories, offering a view deep into the heart of the physics of the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="20"> Scientists who have studied the supernova have found that most of their earlier theories have stood the test well.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="21"> Just as the theories suggested, the supernova has demonstrated that exploding stars produce the heavy elements that make up so much of the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="22"> More recently, scientists have discovered what they had expected to find at the center of the supernova, a spinning neutron star called a pulsar that sends off energy like a spinning lighthouse.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="23"> But no one expected the pulsar to be spinning as rapidly as it apparently is: 2,000 times a second.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="24"> That rapid spin rate is one of the bigger surprises in Supernova 1987A, which is in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 170,000 light years away.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="25"> Equally important, however, was the discovery that the supernova was sending out neutrinos.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="26"> In all, 20 neutrinos were detected in two large detectors, one in Japan and the other in Ohio.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="27"> That alone was considered a significant achievement, since neutrinos do not have an electrical charge and thus are extremely difficult to capture.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="28"> Trillions of them are constantly passing through the Earth without ever touching anything, but occasionally one collides with an atom in a neutrino detector, and the debris from that collision tells scientists something -- but not much -- about neutrinos.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="29"> Not Enough Data</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="30"> So while the detection of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A was somewhat of a triumph, the data gained was not adequate to determine whether neutrinos have enough mass to be significant in the cosmological question concerning the fate of the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="31"> And that set UCLA's Cline to thinking.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="32"> Cline, who teaches both physics and astronomy, decided that if he could get the gravity wave physicists working with the neutrino astronomers, they might collectively solve one of the great problems of modern astronomy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="33"> The way to determine whether a neutrino has any mass is to figure out the speed at which it travels.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="34"> If it has no mass, it would be a packet of pure energy, traveling at the speed of light.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="35"> Even a slight mass would slow it a little.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="36"> For Supernova 1987A, scientists tried to determine the speed of the neutrinos on the basis of the time of the sighting of the explosion.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="37"> Since they arrived at Earth at virtually the same time as the visible light, the 20 detected neutrinos did not have enough mass to be significant.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="38"> But all 20 of those were of one type, called electron neutrinos.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="39"> There are two other types, called the muon and tau neutrinos, which are stronger candidates for having significant mass, and which were not detected from Supernova 1987A.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="40"> New Detectors Planned</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="41"> More-sensitive detectors are planned for the years ahead, but even if muon and tau neutrinos can be detected, there remains the problem of determining how long it took them to get here.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="42"> And that brought the gravity physicists and the neutrino astronomers together last week for the UCLA conference.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="43"> A number of major gravity wave detectors are being planned around the world, including a $100-million joint project by Caltech and MIT that the National Science Foundation is expected to finance.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="44"> The new detectors should be sensitive enough to detect gravity waves created by a supernova.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="45"> In his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein postulated that some events, such as colliding or exploding stars, would send out bursts of radiation in the form of gravity waves.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="46"> That concept has become generally accepted among physicists, although no one has been able to prove it.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="47"> The hope is that the next generation of gravity detectors, especially the one planned by Caltech and MIT, will be sensitive enough to detect them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="48"> Since gravity waves travel at the speed of light, the difference between the time that gravity waves are detected and the time that neutrinos are detected would offer a precise way of determining the mass of all three types of neutrinos.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="49"> Network of Detectors</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="50"> Cline and the other scientists who were at the UCLA symposium are trying to establish a framework for gravity wave detectors scattered around the world to work in concert with the equally scattered neutrino detectors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="51"> "We need to do it now," said Stanford University physics professor William Fairbank.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="52"> "This could become a very exciting program".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="53"> The neutrino detectors could be put on alert as soon as the gravity wave detectors report their first hits.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="54"> That would ensure that all the data from that period would be preserved for future study.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="55"> If the neutrinos arrive simultaneously with the gravity waves, as many scientists expect, that will rule them out as candidates for the "missing mass," and scientists can start looking for something else.</s>

<s docid="LA022689-0112" num="56"> If they arrive sometime later -- and that could even be a year later if the supernova is far enough away -- it will mean that these tiny, illusive elements will have the last word on the future of the universe.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="10"> Scientists have succeeded in recent years in unraveling some of the great mysteries of the universe, but some where out there, trillions of miles away, the grandest trophy of all awaits discovery.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="11"> That trophy is a simple answer to the most haunting question of all: Are we alone?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="12"> The quest for an answer has proved nearly as frustrating as it is important, because the distance between stars is so vast that it has been impossible to prove whether other stars even have planets and thus could support life.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="13"> But today, scientists see themselves on the brink of discovering whether planetary systems are rare or common throughout the universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="14"> "The technology is now at hand to search for planetary systems," said David Black, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="15"> "We are witnessing the birth of a new discipline".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="16"> That technology will include a wide range of orbiting telescopes that will have to function on a level of perfection almost beyond imagination.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="17"> It will take years, and possibly decades, to design, build and put the telescopes in orbit, but scientists believe they are ready to begin answering a question that has bedeviled humans since the dawn of history.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="18"> The search is hampered by the fact that there is only one known planetary system throughout the entire universe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="19"> "We only have one we can study, and that is our own," Peter Goldreich of Caltech told a planetary seminar at UC Berkeley marking the 100th birthday of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="20"> But because the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, there is little evidence remaining that has not been severely altered by the passage of time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="21"> "All the clues we have are very old," Goldreich said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="22"> What happened all those many years ago to cause nine planets to form around a young, undistinguished star?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="23"> While scientists disagree on the details, there is a consensus on how it all began.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="24"> Experts believe that in its prenatal stage the sun was a giant cloud of gas and dust, called a "solar nebula," drifting through the galaxy.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="25"> Like clouds in the Earth's atmosphere, some areas were more dense than others, and they gradually accumulated enough material to create weak gravitational fields.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="26"> As the denser pockets grew in mass they swirled around each other and ultimately merged, causing the core of the cloud to grow ever more compact.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="27"> In time, the inner core of the cloud collapsed from the increasingly strong gravitational field, causing an implosion that set off a nuclear chain reaction.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="28"> It was a spectacular -- but not unusual -- event, repeated billions of times throughout the Milky Way galaxy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="29"> Another star had been born, a star destined to become a modest, average performer, like trillions and trillions of others.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="30"> After its birth, the sun remained cloaked in a cloud of gas and dust for awhile.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="31"> But the new star generated powerful forces, including an immense magnetic field and fierce solar winds that soon began sweeping the cloud away from the sun's poles and into a flat disk that swirled around its equator.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="32"> The dust and gas then coalesced into planets.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="33"> In recent years, space-borne observatories and advances in the sensitivity of ground-based telescopes have found evidence that disks routinely form around young stars, but they do not last very long.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="34"> Richard Terrile of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Brad Smith of the University of Arizona captured a dramatic photograph of a star known as Beta Pictoris, showing a band of infrared radiation around its central core, indicating the presence of a disk.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="35"> Astronomers Steven Beckwith of Cornell University and Anneila Sargent of Caltech took that one step further and discovered several young stars with disks.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="36"> But their evidence suggests that a disk lasts only through a star's infancy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="37"> Other findings support that.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="38"> The husband-and-wife team of Steve and Karen Strom of the University of Massachusetts found that 60% of the stars they looked at showed signs of a disk.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="39"> "But as they age, stars lose the infrared signature," Steve Strom said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="40"> The disk disappears by the time a star is only about 3 million to 10 million years old.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="41"> That leaves astronomers with the predicament of having evidence that disks are a common part of star formation, but with real difficulties in showing how a system like the sun's should be able to form before the star blows the gas and dust away.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="42"> "The question is, can you form planets before the solar nebula goes away"? asked astronomer Peter Bodenheimer of Lick Observatory.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="43"> Does that suggest that our solar system is possibly unique, an aberration in the star formation process?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="44"> Probably not, most experts believe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="45"> "We expect to find that planetary systems occur rather frequently in nature," Black, of the Lunar and Planetary Institute, said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="46"> That optimism is supported by a team of Canadian astronomers who announced two years ago that they had detected evidence of planets orbiting around at least two nearby stars.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="47"> The stars are so bright, and the planets so dim, that it is not possible to see them, but astronomer Bruce Campbell, who led the Canadian team, insists they are there.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="48"> Planets would not simply travel in perfect circles around a stationary star.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="49"> Instead, the entire system would orbit around a point at the center of the system's mass.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="50"> That would cause the star to "wobble" slightly, Campbell said.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="51"> Sometimes the star would appear to be moving slightly closer to a distant observer, and at other times it would appear to be receding.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="52"> But since the star is so much more massive than the planets, the point around which everything rotates would still be within the star, just slightly off center.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="53"> That, in turn, makes detection a formidable task.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="54"> Scientists are now proposing some extremely sophisticated telescopes in hopes of finally resolving the issue.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="55"> All of the telescopes would have to be placed in orbit because the measurements are so exacting that the Earth's atmosphere would distort the results.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="56"> Physicist Eugene Levy of the University of Arizona believes it should be possible to detect planets through a process known as "astrometry".</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="57"> That involves tracking stars so precisely that any deviation -- such as that caused by orbiting planets -- could be demonstrated.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="58"> A star with planets should travel in small circles.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="59"> That would cause a slight change in the angle when viewed from the Earth.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="60"> But what a tiny change it would be.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="61"> Levy tried to dramatize that point in a presentation during the Berkeley symposium.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="62"> Standing behind a lectern, Levy tapped the side of a light on top of the speaker's stand.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="63"> He told his listeners to look at him while sighting along the side of the light.</s>

<s docid="LA090489-0037" num="64"> Then, he said, move in along the light the width of one atom.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="11"> Using a 36-inch telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, astronomers Juan Uson of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Stephen Boughn of Haverford College and Jeffrey Kuhn of Michigan State University were able to detect a "halo" of diffuse light surrounding a massive galaxy at the center of Abell 2029.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="12"> A mosaic of 16 images made with light-sensitive electronic "chips" showed the diffuse halo to be remarkably uniform, leading the astronomers to conclude they were looking at a single galaxy, the largest ever discovered.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102590-0235" num="14"> The scientists believe that they are seeing a giant galaxy primarily because the halo's light spreads very smoothly outward from the central galaxy and because the halo has the same elliptical shape as the central galaxy.</s>

Shternberg; Kazakh State University imeni al Farabi; UDC 523.4-523.62-726] [Abstract] In a survey of the history and background of "asteroid hazard," the researchers here define such danger as the threat of collision with Drobyshevskiy cometoids or comet-shower comets from Oort's Cloud, asteroids near the Earth (primarily of cometary origin), asteroids with chaotic orbits, and short-period comets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42553" num="21"> We are, they conclude, in a period of minimal cometary activity and asteroid hazard because the last cometary shower caused by disturbance of the cometary cloud ended long ago, and the next such event will not occur for at least 10 million years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42553" num="22"> Nor are there at present any objects near the Sun that could cause such a shower.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42553" num="23"> Finally, the unexpected and unpredictable cometoid activity described by Drobyshevskiy and resulting from an explosion of the Jovian moon Callisto is virtually impossible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42553" num="24"> At the same time, the statistically unpredictable fluctuation in asteroid hazard dictate that we refine our theoretical research of the problem and set up observation programs.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="47"> The result, said astronomer Peter Serlemitsos, the instrument's principal investigator, "tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black holes," because the sensitive instrument found exactly what theorists had predicted it would find if the galaxy has a black hole at its center.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="48"> This telescope does not produce pictures.</s>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="49"> Instead, it produces a "spectrum" that shows the characteristics of the light emitted by the target.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="51"> The X-ray telescope also measures the level at which X-rays are being produced by the target, and, according to theory, that level should rise enormously near a black hole because more material is being ripped apart in the violent process.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120890-0048" num="52"> And, in a dramatic announcement Friday, Serlemitsos said the data collected by his instrument amounted to "undisputed evidence that this upturn does indeed take place".</s>

<s docid="LA011590-0098" num="9"> An international team of astronomers last week reported that it may have witnessed the birth of a pair of quasars.</s>

<s docid="LA011590-0098" num="10"> Dr. Georges Meylan of NASA's Space Telescope Institute said his team has detected an object in the constellation Pisces that appears to be a pair of quasars separated by less than 100,000 light years -- a small distance in cosmic terms.</s>

<s docid="LA011590-0098" num="12"> Quasi-stellar objects, or quasars, are thought to be the very bright cores of certain galaxies, and some astronomers believe that their intense energy may be caused by their material being pulled inward to giant black holes.</s>

<s docid="LA011590-0098" num="13"> The international team, which also includes scientists from Caltech in Pasadena and from West Germany, said it has discovered what it believes to be the first true set of quasar "twins" using a 40-inch telescope near Le Serena, Chile.</s>

<s docid="LA011590-0098" num="14"> In findings presented at the American Astronomical Society's national meeting in Alexandria, Va., the researchers said the quasar twins lie so close together in space that astronomers speculate their gravity fields may be interacting with one another and spurring formation of the intensely bright objects.</s>
