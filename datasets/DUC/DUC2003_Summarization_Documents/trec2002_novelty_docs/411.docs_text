<s docid="FT922-4205" num="6"> ON THE starless and stormy night of January 4 1656, the Nuestra Senora de las Maravillas - Our Lady of the Marvels - fired a cannon shot to warn the rest of its flotilla of approaching sandbanks off the Little Bahama Bank.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="7"> In the confusion that followed, the Spanish treasure galleon was rammed by its sister ship, the Concepcion.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="8"> According to Don Diego Portichuelo de Rivadeneryra, a priest on board the Maravillas: 'The Concepcion gave such a blow to our boom with her cutwater, which had been newly refitted in Havana and made of mahogany, that it broke in three pieces.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="9"> That blow broke through our planks from the top of the waterline to the holds, making splinters of all of them'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="10"> Impaled from port to starboard, wallowing in heavy seas, the Maravillas' death throes were swift.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="11"> The 40 tons of gold and silver bullion and treasure, destined to fund another of King Philip IV's interminable wars against France, dragged the 150 ft-long ship on to a coral reef.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="12"> On deck, priests were mobbed by crewmen eager to make their last confessions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="13"> Some priests demanded gold and jewels as payment, doubtless hoping to survive and enjoy Heaven on Earth as well as in the hereafter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="14"> The bow of the Maravillas went down in only 30 ft of water but massive waves ripped the stern - containing most of the treasure - away to sink elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="15"> Of the 650 people on board, only 45 lived.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="16"> Those who clung to debris were swept away by swirling currents.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="17"> Others grabbed hold of the mast and rigging that remained above water, but died from exposure and attacks by tiger sharks.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="18"> (Tiger sharks guard the wreck to this day).</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="19"> The avaricious priests plunged to the bottom, their cassocks weighted down by booty.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="20"> As the centuries passed, the shifting sands covered both bones and gold.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="21"> But 335 years later, in 40 ft of water, a crew member scuba-diving off a salvage ship, the RV Beacon, uncovered from the sunken bow section a cache of gold coins and a Spanish colonial gold pectoral cross set with 66 well-matched emeralds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="22"> The cross was auctioned at Christie's in London nine days ago, where it fetched a record Pounds 231,000.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="23"> The cross was the prize piece in a sale of 157 lots salvaged from the Maravillas, ranging from individual gold and silver coins and bars to jewellery and even a bronze signal cannon - perhaps the same one that fired that fateful shot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="24"> The sale earned the treasure hunters a total of Pounds 430,000.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="25"> But the real pay-day could be to come.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="26"> The Maravillas' manifest shows it was carrying cargo worth, in present-day terms, more than Dollars 1.6bn - but the real value could be much more, because Spanish sailors displayed great ingenuity at smuggling.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="27"> Thus, now the cross has gone under the auctioneer's hammer, the Beacon's crew are preparing to search for the mother lode.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="28"> Legend insists that, in addition to the bullion, the Maravillas' stern also contained a life-size statue of the Madonna and Child - weighing more than half a ton and cast from solid gold - plus a 400 lb gold table studded with emeralds, rubies and diamonds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="29"> If found, their value is incalculable.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="30"> Herbert Humphreys, 44, heads Marex, a Memphis-based underwater salvage company which has been diving on the galleon since 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="31"> He says the business of recovering sunken treasure can be 'boring, tedious, expensive and dangerous'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="32"> But he adds: 'It is also one of the most exciting adventures left on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="33"> To dive beneath the sea and hold in your hand a weapon, a coin, a piece of jewellery or a tool that belonged to some unknown and long-dead man or woman is an experience few people can have.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="34"> I have seen the stuff that dreams are made of'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="35"> Humphreys has been hooked on these particular dreams since, aged eight and playing on a Bahamas beach, he picked up a gold coin washed ashore by the shifting seas.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="36"> For his 16th birthday, his father - co-founder of a cooking oil company which merged, profitably, with the giant Kraft food empire in 1951 - gave him a copy of Fell's Guide to Sunken Treasure Ships of the World.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="37"> Written on the title page is the inscription: 'Hope you find Dollars 10m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="38"> Love, Dad'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="39"> Humphreys still has the well-thumbed book but, these days, his financial sights are set rather higher.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="40"> Indeed, he appears to have inherited a certain financial flair.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="41"> He had a private education which gave him all the traditional social graces and charm of the Southern gentleman, and travelled the world with his parents.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="42"> After winning a horse-jumping competition at 16, he invested the Dollars 5,500 prize money in Philippines gold stock at 25 cents a share.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="43"> He sold it a few years later at Dollars 30 a share.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="44"> At 22, he became convinced that the clear waters off the Cayman Islands would be irresistible to scuba divers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="45"> So, he negotiated a Holiday Inns' franchise for Grand Cayman at a time when there were only two other small hotels on the island.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="46"> Now, he has extensive shipping, air charter and travel businesses in the Caribbean and Memphis.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="47"> Humphreys served in Vietnam with the US Navy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="48"> He is a qualified pilot and parachutist who speaks and writes French and Italian.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="49"> Politically, he is right wing: he was a major-general in the FDN Legion, a Nicaraguan Contra organisation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="50"> His first wreck was HMS Thunderer, a British warship which went down off Honduras in 1780 carrying looted Spanish and French cargo.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="51"> It was an archaeological dream untouched for 203 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="52"> Archaeology is the key word, because Humphreys regards preservation as the first and foremost goal of treasure recovery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="53"> 'Every nail, every little pottery shard, each musket ball, literally everything we find is treasure to me.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="54"> We have an artefact preservationist on board the Beacon who dedicates himself to preserving these important time capsules of the past.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="55"> I want to share the results of our work with the public'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="56"> He employs a full-team of marine archaeologists and researchers and has already given precious metals and 17th century artefacts to museums in the Caribbean.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="57"> Inspired by his success with the Thunderer, he founded Marex (Marine Archaeological Rescue) in 1984 and persuaded the Bahamian authorities to let him excavate the Maravillas (they get 25 per cent).</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="58"> Treasure-hunting today is many microchips away from a rowing boat and a snorkel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="59"> The Beacon is packed with high-tech equipment, giant sand-blowers and metal detectors.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="60"> It has been searching the shallow Bahama Bank for the past five summers, raising Dollars 5m in treasure.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="61"> The annual operating costs of Dollars 200,000 come from Humphreys' own pocket.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="62"> When he is on board, he is the first diver out in the morning and the last one back at night.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="63"> Among his own discoveries was a 100.85-carat emerald, the largest ever discovered from a shipwreck.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="64"> That stimulated him still further and now he wants to explore deep-water wrecks.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="65"> To that end, Marex has just signed a profit-share deal with the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology which, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is in dire need of commercial funding.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="66"> The Russians have two MIRs - three-man submarines which can operate at depths of nearly 20,000 ft (6,000 metres) - and filmed the Titanic in the north Atlantic last year.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="67"> They intend to start operations in the autumn and their first targets are all in deep international waters: a 22,000-ton liner, believed to contain 50 boxes of gold, somewhere off Liberia; a World War Two submarine; and an ancient French wreck off Barbados thought to hold priceless Ming porcelain, a gift from the Chinese emperor to Louis XIV.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="68"> The MIRs will be working 18-hour dives at depths where the water is pitch black, pressure would make a man implode and the greatest danger to sanity comes not from claustrophobia but its opposite, agoraphobia, triggered by being surrounded by vast expanses of open sea.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="69"> There is plenty of potential to create a new industry, though.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="70"> During the war, 10,000 Allied ships were sunk by enemy action.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="71"> Their unrecovered cargoes include gold, silver, jewels, nickel, manganese, tin, copper and aluminium.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="72"> Long term, Marex has targeted 23 wrecks with cargo valued at Dollars 500m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="73"> Retrieval costs are estimated at Dollars 35m to Dollars 50m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="74"> But while diving on ships like the Maravillas can be seen as a hobby, albeit an expensive one, financing deep-water salvage is altogether different.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="75"> Although the technology has been available for years, it remains largely unproven.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="76"> Investors - who accept cheerfully that it costs Dollars 90m to repair a satellite in space, or are prepared to risk Dollars 50m financing a movie that might prove a flop - are wary.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="77"> Humphreys is confident of success.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="78"> But he admits: 'My true love is the old wrecks because they reek of history, romance and adventure.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="79"> My personal interest in this is much more than mere monetary gain.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="80"> Underwater treasure-hunting has been my life-long interest and one that I believe to be the last frontier on this planet'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="81"> He hopes to strike the jackpot with the Maravillas any time now.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="82"> 'Under the water, we have found some of the gold bars from the ship marked with the owners' names, and a trail of gold coins two miles long.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="83"> We believe that trail is leading us towards the mother lode.</s>

<s docid="FT922-4205" num="84"> This season, we will find the stern - and who knows what will be in it.'</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="9"> The weekend after Hurricane Hugo hit the South Carolina coast, James Lamb, coin director of Christie's, the New York auction house, made a secretive trip to a Southern port city.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="10"> Lamb won't name the city but will say that he went there to see what has become the talk of the coin community: the horde of gold coins and bullion pulled from the wreck of the SS Central America before the hurricane struck.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="11"> "It was very, very exciting," Lamb said.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="12"> "I spent (a day) down there.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="13"> It was the most extraordinary day of my career".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="14"> For Lamb, that's quite a statement.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="15"> Among the numismatic experts who have reviewed the list of coins and gold bars taken from the wreck, 200 miles off Charleston, there is widespread agreement that the find is certain to make investors in the Columbus American Discovery Group wealthy indeed.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="16"> The gold, unloaded recently from a salvage ship in Norfolk, Va., has been valued at $28 million to $450 million.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="17"> "There has never been anything like this," Lamb said.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="18"> "One of the things that makes a difference from other shipwrecks is that the coins appear to be in good shape".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="19"> None of the hundreds of U.S. gold coins recovered, thus far, from the 132-year-old wreck have knocked the coin community on its ear.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="20"> The most impressive find has been the pioneer gold coins and bars, which were produced by assay offices in California and were being shipped East when the Central America sank in a hurricane in 1857.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="21"> Eleven pioneer coins have been catalogued thus far, and the American Numismatic Assn. says eight of them, $50 gold pieces from the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="22"> Assay Office in San Francisco, have the highest value, up to $20,000 each.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="23"> Even so, that places the value of the individual coins well below the record $1.35 million reportedly paid for a 1852 $20 pioneer gold coin produced by San Francisco's Augustus Humbert.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="24"> That coin was reported to be of mint uncirculated quality.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="25"> What is making a review of the Central America's coins difficult is that many were discovered welded together by time and marine life.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="26"> The salvage teams have not decided whether to break some of those coins apart to assess their value.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="27"> What has excited most experts has been the large number of gold bars and coins from California's pioneer mints, including Kellogg & Humbert, Harris Marchant & Co., Justh & Hunter, and Henry Hentsch.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="28"> The larger gold bars weigh 5 to 750 ounces each and are stamped with an assayer's mark, a serial number and the bar weight in troy ounces, the parts per thousand gold and its dollar value when the bar was melted.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="29"> As of mid-September, the Columbus America group reported it had recovered 494.21 troy pounds of gold in bars alone.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="33"> Mints, "it's difficult to say without looking at the individual coins," said Stephen Bobbitt, a spokesman for the American Numismatic Assn. in Colorado Springs, Colo.</s>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="34"> "But Robert Hoge, our curator, says it doesn't look as if there is anything of major significance" among the coins.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="35"> The highest-priced U.S. coin, according to the ANA's review, could be $7,750 for a $5 gold "Classic Head" coin, produced between 1834 and 1838.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101289-0146" num="37"> NEXT STEP A key to how much the find ultimately will be worth will rest in how the gold coins and bars are marketed.</s>

<s docid="LA053190-0084" num="66"> For all the thousands of dollars and immeasurable hours spent searching for the treasure of the Trinidad, perhaps the most remarkable fact of all is that Markey's theories have been so widely believed in the first place.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="12"> It was Clarence F.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="13"> Shangraw, chief curator of the Museum of Asian Art in San Francisco, who made the first spectacular discovery.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="14"> He found that the 708 bits and pieces of what once had been 235 cups, bowls, plates and a vase were from two distinct periods of manufacture, some made in the mid 1570s, some made 20 years later, in the mid-1590s.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="17"> Von der Porten, director of the Treasure Island Museum, made the second discovey: The older shards showed no signs of sea damage, even though they were finer and more delicate.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="18"> But those made around 1595 had been worn in the way that pounding surf and sand smooth rough edges.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="19"> "Two totally independent methods of analysis gave us identical answers," Von der Porten said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="20"> The answers, they reported, are clear: The older shards had to have been carried carefully ashore.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="21"> They could only have come from Drake's ship.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="22"> They had to be from the crates of precious Chinese ceramics logged aboard the Golden Hind when they were pirated by Drake from Spanish outposts and ships along the Central American Coast of the Pacific Ocean on the voyage before he reached Point Reyes.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="23"> Records make clear that the crates were not aboard when the Golden Hind returned to England.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="24"> As Drake consolidated his supplies for the long voyage home, he must reluctantly have lightened cargo and left the dishes for the Indians to use.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="25"> The ceramics made a generation later must have been aboard the San Agustin, a Spanish trading vessel plying the Pacific between Acapulco and Manila.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="26"> It had been blown far off course and then sank in a terrible storm at Drakes Bay on Nov. 30, 1595.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="29"> There was a lively but risky trade across the Pacific in those days, dominated by Spanish galleons running between the west coast of Mexico and the Philippines and Indonesia.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="30"> Chinese ceramics were transferred in junks from points of manufacture to the trading ports, such as Manila.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="31"> Galleons brought them to places like Acapulco.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="32"> They were carted overland to Vera Cruz for shipment to Europe where extraordinary prices were paid, even for the lower-quality goods.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="33"> Drake's booty included the finest products of Jingdezhen in south-central China, the center of fine ceramics from the 14th Century even to this day.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="34"> But the San Agustin's cargo was of poorer-quality bowls and plates made on the south coast by entrepreneurs quick to respond to the lucrative market.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="35"> The Miwok tribespeople apparently smashed most of the ceramics that came into their possession to make jewelry, even one elegant pendant, and to fashion effective tools for scraping hides.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="36"> "Each culture finds a different use," Shangraw said philosophically.</s>

<s docid="LA030589-0073" num="37"> Some of the shards are now part of a traveling exhibition being shown in major museums, but Von der Porten hopes for a permanent exhibit in California one of these days.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="9"> A sailboat that sank here 2,400 years ago may be the first vessel ever found that was built by the Phoenicians, an ancient people famous for their sophisticated boats and mastery of the sea.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="10"> The craft, the size of a modern racing yacht, sank about 75 yards off this communal agricultural farm in northern Israel, archeologists said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="11"> Among the items aboard the vessel were a master craftsman's toolbox with a drill, a carpenter's square, a heart-shaped jewelry box and a cooking pot still covered with soot, they said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="12"> Jay Rosloff, the project's field director, said it was too soon to establish the vessel's origin with certainty.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="15"> "During these times in this area, Phoenicians had a virtual franchise on shipping," Rosloff said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="16"> He said no Phoenician shipwreck has previously been found.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="17"> The Phoenicians were the most famous seafarers of the ancient world and dominated the Mediterranean with their trade.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="18"> They emerged about 1,000 BC and survived until Roman times.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="19"> Rosloff said another early boat, a Greek vessel, was discovered off the Turkish-Cypriot port of Kyrenia.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="20"> Although it was built 150 years later than the sailboat found here, it was not as sophisticated.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="21"> Skillful Shipwright</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="22"> The shipwright who built the vessel used iron instead of copper nails common in Greek vessels and employed an elaborate technique called scarfing in which wooden pieces are fitted together.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="23"> "This craft has so many quirks that are different (from the Greek vessel) that it indicates a different cultural milieu," said Rosloff as he stood on the beach next to an actual-size outline of the hull built with sandbags.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="24"> The vessel is 10 yards long, three yards wide and about two yards high from keel to deck.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="25"> Most of the hull has been preserved, but the masts, sails and cabin have been lost.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="26"> On Maiden Voyage?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="27"> The boat was built around 450 BC and was in its first season, possibly on its maiden voyage, when it sank, said Elisha Linder, who heads the project run by Haifa University's Center for Maritime Studies.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="28"> He said the hull showed little wear.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="29"> He speculated that the sailors got too close to shore because they were hiding from pirates or seeking shelter from a storm.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="30"> A large chunk is missing from the hull, indicating that the boat sank after hitting a rock or reef.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="31"> For 2,400 years, the vessel was covered by sand and hidden from view.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="32"> But in 1985, currents briefly washed away some of the sand, and kibbutz member Avi Eshel caught a glimpse of pottery scraps and ballast stones while diving with his daughter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="33"> Linder had just completed his fifth fruitless summer hunting for Phoenician shipwrecks in Italy when he got word about the find in Magan Michael, where he lives.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="34"> More Evidence Needed</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="35"> "It was like a present," Linder said.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="36"> But he cautioned that more evidence, such as a seal or coins, is needed to conclusively link the vessel to the Phoenicians.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="37"> Since the dig began last year, divers have brought up small pieces of the wreck, which is under about six feet of water.</s>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="38"> On land, the pieces are treated with chemicals, and the parts will eventually be reassembled, Rosloff said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="39"> "Through model work and graphics, we will extrapolate the rest of the boat," said Rosloff, a lecturer at Haifa University who originally came from Kendall Park, N.J.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="40"> The delicate excavation work is limited to just a few weeks a year because of a heavy surf and strong currents that keep covering the wreck with sand.</s>
</P>

<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="41"> Valuable No Matter What</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="42"> Even if the vessel turns out not to be Phoenician, the wreck will reveal many details about ancient seafarers, said Rosloff.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="43"> The hull is the oldest and most complete to be discovered and may reveal clues about ancient ship-building techniques.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="44"> "The wood that is left is in beautiful condition because the sand covered it so quickly," Rosloff said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061889-0115" num="45"> "We don't know how ancient boats were built," added Linder.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="7"> no one on the tiny Channel Island of Alderney is sure exactly - a fishermen named Bertie Cosheril found a heavily-encrusted lump of metal in one of his lobster pots.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="8"> It turned out to contain a musket.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="9"> Marine archaeologists now believe it dates from Elizabethan times and that the wreck near which it was discovered could be a ship that sank off the island in 1592, four years after the Spanish armada.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="10"> If so, it will be the first Elizabethan warship ever found.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="11"> 'The metal looked like a bit of rusty old iron at first,' says Cosheril, a diminutive 62-year-old, 'and, when I got it to the surface, I thought it might be a German gun.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="12"> I took it to the chap at the museum but he didn't think it was worth bothering about'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="13"> It was only when Bertie broke the metal that he found the musket inside and showed it to two local divers, Fred Shaw and Dave Rendell.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="14"> 'We were both excited about it,' says Shaw.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="15"> 'It's rare to have one in that fair a condition.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="16"> Bertie agreed to show us where he found it and, the next time he went out, we followed.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="17"> He was going round in a circle and we were following like a dog on a lead and I was thinking: 'Has he got his marks right'? when he shouted 'About here, Fred'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="18"> 'As I was flipping myself over the side, I remember he called out: 'I hope you find a cannon'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="19"> I just laughed, because I never expected to see one.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="20"> But, as I swam down, I couldn't believe my eyes because, in two or three minutes, I did'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="21"> Rendell also found broken pottery and large pieces of ship timbers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="22"> They reported the new finds but the local authority was not interested.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="23"> Enter Martin Woodwood, 44, a professional diver who owns the Maritime Museum at Bembridge, Isle of Wight, and is a friend of Cosheril's.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="24"> In 1984, he persuaded the local divers to have another look at the site.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="25"> 'In the 16th century, divers couldn't go down deeper than 30ft-40ft,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="26"> 'As this one was in fairly deep water (around 90ft), they wouldn't have been able to salvage it'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="27"> In 1985, the area was surveyed with a magnotometer, but it was not until May 12 1991 that they dived again.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="28"> Woodwood found the cannon Shaw had seen originally and realised the potential of the site.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="29"> Shaw then formed a group to carry on the work and it sent some of the pottery it salvaged to Bob Burns, archaeologist to the States (government) of Guernsey.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="30"> 'I'd heard rumours that an interesting wreck had been found, and that it was early 18th century,' Burns says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="31"> 'But when I saw the pottery, I thought: this isn't 18th century, it's 1600 to 1610'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="32"> The Elizabethan Diving Group - as it now calls itself - has since brought up more than 100 artefacts.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="33"> They include iron breastplates, matchlock muskets, cannon balls, sword scabbards, knife handles, a gun carriage, helmets, pewter pipe, bowls, spoons and stirrups.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="34"> 'We've brought up more on a few dives than they ever found on the Mary Rose,' says Shaw.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="35"> Burns adds: 'The wonderful thing about this shipwreck is that it's an instant in time.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="36"> You have a whole cross-section of Elizabethan naval and military life sitting on the bottom of the sea and everything, we believe, belongs to February 1592.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="37"> It was a period between Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I, 50 years after the Mary Rose, when seamanship and ships, weaponry, fighting tactics and methods of killing people all started to change'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="38"> Which ship was it?</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="39"> No one knows for sure but David Keys, an archaeologist and writer, consulted the Public Records Office at Kew in west London.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="40"> He found that a warship on its way to Brittany sank off Alderney in February 1592 and that Sir John Norris, commander of an English garrison in Brittany, wrote about certain despatches being lost 'in the ship that went down off the coast of Alderney'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="41"> Archaeologists are cautious, though.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="42"> Michael Bowyer, now the licencee of the site, teaches marine archaeology at Bangor University in north Wales and this summer has co-directed the professional excavation with Oxford University archaeologist Mensun Bound.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="43"> 'It could be one of a number of ships,' Bowyer says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="44"> 'We have a vague suspicion that it might be one called the Makeshift.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="45"> A ship of that name was built in 1563 and disappeared from records around 1592'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="46"> Alderney's Receiver of Wrecks, David Jenkins, has proclaimed the site a protected area and no one can dive around it without a licence.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="47"> The ship itself has become the responsibility of the island's transport committee, one reason being the cost of conserving the artefacts (there are no plans to bring up the whole vessel).</s>

<s docid="FT933-8545" num="48"> As Burns explains: 'To conserve even one breast-plate requires enormous expertise plus a large amount of time and, thereby, money because, the moment you bring it out of the water, it starts to deteriorate.'</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="9"> Robert D. Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship Bismarck.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="10"> In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="15"> "There are pairs of shoes all over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="16"> Their shoes are still there.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="22"> The Moment of Discovery</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="23"> "I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set eyes on something that has never been seen before," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="24"> "The first time I saw the Titanic, wow!</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="25"> There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the gloom and there it was".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="26"> For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant when he connects palpably with history.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="27"> "The best experience that I can give that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="28"> "To go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the cavalry.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="29"> That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="30"> You sense Crazy Horse there. . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="31"> Well, when you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="32"> It's no longer abstract" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="33"> Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became captivated by the Pacific Ocean.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="34"> Now, four years after the discovery of the Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the 47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="35"> This time around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="36"> Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic and Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="37"> It is the kind of popularizing of science that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="38"> But Ballard says he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that may help convince children that science is a "contact sport".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="39"> Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact with history and science.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="40"> Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="41"> So Ballard's expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="42"> (This kind of exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that "we had 100,000 pounds of equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree").</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="43"> "You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea -- 50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation," Ballard says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="44"> The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="45"> The battleship was in "16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range," Ballard says, not without enthusiasm.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="46"> "It was in an awful place and it was in the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="47"> Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the ocean floor.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="48"> "I do it because of the challenge to do it," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="49"> "But I'm also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="50">. . . There is probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the museums of the world" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="51"> Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing the "huge painted swastikas" on the ship's bow and stern.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="52"> In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines, was one of the most powerful warships afloat.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="53"> And briefly it proved to be just that.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="54"> Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy looking for it.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="55"> At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="56"> Discovered by two British heavy cruisers</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="57"> on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="58"> From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood, starting a fire in an ammunition locker.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="59"> Within minutes the Hood exploded, killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="60"> The Prince of Wales was also damaged.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="61"> Of the Bismarck, "the British were lucky to get it to the bottom," Ballard claims.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="62"> In the climactic battle, a "freak hit" by a torpedo launched from a vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the crippled battleship to "wait for the British to come and get it".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="63"> Of course, the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west of France.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="64"> Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling by her own crew.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="65"> But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="66"> The British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war prize, he says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="67"> At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="68"> About 10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="69"> Bismarck's Survivors</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="70"> "So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way down," Ballard says.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="71"> "If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="72"> So it's sort of academic who sank it".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="73"> Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew survived.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="74"> Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in the water after their ship disappeared.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="75"> It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="76"> "When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and were alive after the ship went under," he says, leaning forward in his chair.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="77"> "And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the water alive.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="78">. . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him?</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="79"> He's paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="80"> Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except to German authorities.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="81"> As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided country would have the more legitimate claim.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="82"> As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="83"> As for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical knowledge.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="84"> In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="85"> Developed Deep-Sea Robots</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="86"> But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="87"> In particular he is a proponent of machines, especially robots.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="88"> Ballard has headed up the development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason system.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="89"> Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean research and exploration, he says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="90"> While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made "to fully robotic exploration," Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control cable.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="91"> It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day "commuting" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="92"> Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the "romantic little guys," referring to the small submarines.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="93"> He explains: ".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="94">. . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this little sphere.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="98"> Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="99"> But recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of "telepresence" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way many people "travel".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="100"> More important, he sees the technology as capable of rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="101"> "We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence," he says in a gee-whiz way.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="102"> "In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive way of people living their lives.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="103"> In other words, ultimately you won't travel that much.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="104"> You'll travel in a telepresence way.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="107"> Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that he's already using it to change the way he lives.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="108"> He recently built a house near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="109"> His goal is "to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by living in Montana".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0059" num="111"> With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="6"> 'BUSINESS plan?</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="7"> Waste of paper,' pronounces Athene English with the confidence that comes with survival.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="8"> From her shop in Hay-on-Wye, on the Welsh Borders, Athene makes by hand, and sells, a range of bags, wallets, saddlery, hunting and shooting items.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="9"> Raw materials include traditional English leathers, and 200-year-old Russian reindeer skins recovered from a shipwreck.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="10"> Items are costed by adding the price of the raw material to labour, calculated at Pounds 5 an hour, then applying a mark-ups of 33 per cent for wholesale buyers and up to 100 per cent for retail.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="11"> Off-the-peg retail prices range from Pounds 5.85 for a reindeer key ring, to Pounds 1,450 for a reindeer attache case.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="12"> 'The mark-up is reduced the more labour-intensive the item,' said Athene.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="13"> She began her working life as a professional horse-rider, became PA to the managing director of Gucci, then helped run a small wine import business.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="14"> Drawing on all three experiences, she set up her own business, The English Saddlery Company, in 1982.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="15"> When she started she drew up the three rules that have carried her through: 'One, I was going to produce the highest possible quality work.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="16"> Two, absolutely no credit extended.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="17"> And three, no bank loans: if my business didn't pay for itself, I would close it down'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="18"> Athene did a one-year course in saddlery under Tops, a now-discontinued government training scheme, She bought a set of hand tools for Pounds 250 the last of her TOPS grant.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="19"> Then she moved to Cirencester - 'because it's a well-hooved area' - and started trading.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="20"> Her working capital was just Pounds 500.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="21"> Athene's survival in the early days was due largely to her location on public view in the Cirencester Workshops where craftspeople enjoy subsidised rents.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="22"> 'I was paying around Pounds 20 a week,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="23"> Her first order was to make a parrot lead.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="24"> 'I said yes to all commissions.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="25"> The satisfied customers passed the word around.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="26"> That way, I built up a strong local customer base'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="27"> In the first year Athene's turnover was Pounds 5,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="28"> Over the six years she stayed at Cirencester, this rose to Pounds 13,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="29"> Her customers included international polo players, and a member of the royal family.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="30"> In 1989 she moved to Hay-on-Wye, close to where she grew up.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="31"> She decided to concentrate on the more commercially viable small leather goods.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="32"> She changed the company's name to the English Leather Company to reflect this policy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="33"> 'I realised that I had to take my product to the market, build up a wider clientele,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="34"> After talking to other leatherworkers, Athene decided to trawl the trade shows.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="35"> In 1989, she went to the New York International Gift Show, paying Pounds 1,500 to exhibit.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="36"> 'I didn't get a single order.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="37"> It was a really low point.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="38"> I felt I had misjudged the market'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="39"> One month later, a Japanese company which had been at the fair placed a large order.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="40"> Others followed.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="41"> Japan and the US swiftly became big customers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="42"> By the end of 1991, 75 per cent of business was export.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="43"> Turnover that year was Pounds 39,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="44"> Recently she has stopped exhibiting.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="45"> 'It was getting too expensive, and my customer base was changing.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="46"> Today, 60 per cent of my goods are sold into the home market - increasingly by mail order, which now takes up approximately 20 per cent of the total,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="47"> Turnover has grown steadily.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="48"> Last year, it reached Pounds 54,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="49"> The problem today is insufficient manpower.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="50"> Athene employs a part-time shop assistant.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="51"> Twelve months ago she started contracting out some items - about 10 per cent of orders - to three fellow craftsmen.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="52"> She has made a decision which will enable her to increase production and relax a little.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="53"> 'The Welsh Development Board is giving me a grant / loan package worth a total of Pounds 6,000,' she explains.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="54"> 'I'm investing in some machinery to do routine tasks'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-15029" num="55"> The grant also means she can employ two administrative assistants, giving her the pleasure of going back to where she began - simply making things.</s>
