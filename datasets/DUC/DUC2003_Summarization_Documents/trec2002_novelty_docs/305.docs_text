<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="8"> The federal government's highway safety watchdog said Wednesday that the Ford Bronco II appears to be involved in more fatal roll-over accidents than other vehicles in its class and that it will seek to determine if the vehicle itself contributes to the accidents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="9"> The decision to do an engineering analysis of the Ford Motor Co. utility-sport vehicle grew out of a federal accident study of the Suzuki Samurai, said Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="10"> NHTSA looked at Samurai accidents after Consumer Reports magazine charged that the vehicle had basic design flaws.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="11"> Several Fatalities</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="12"> However, the accident study showed that the "Ford Bronco II appears to have a higher number of single-vehicle, first event roll-overs, particularly those involving fatalities," Hurd said.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="13"> The engineering analysis of the Bronco, the second of three levels of investigation conducted by NHTSA, will cover the 1984-1989 Bronco II models, the agency said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="14"> According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in the September report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehicle roll-overs caused fatalities, or 19 of every 100,000 vehicles.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="15"> There were eight Samurai fatal roll-overs, or 6 per 100,000; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazers or GMC Jimmy, or 6 per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokee roll-overs, for 2.5 per 100,000.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="16"> After the accident report, NHTSA declined to investigate the Samurai.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="17"> In Detroit, a Ford spokeswoman said the involvement of the Bronco II in fatal roll-over accidents "isn't significantly" different from that of other utility vehicles.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="18"> "The Bronco II is well designed and is safe.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="19"> I don't think this reflects the design or engineering of the vehicle," spokeswoman Joyce Stinson said.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="20"> Stresses Safe Driving</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="21"> She said fatal roll-over accidents are "strongly influenced" by the driver's age and training and whether alcohol is involved.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="22"> The type of terrain the vehicle is being driven on is another factor, Stinson said, as well as whether the driver is attempting some extraordinary maneuver with the vehicle.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="23"> The utility vehicles have different handling capabilities, Stinson said, thus Ford stresses safe driving in its manuals for vehicle owners.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="24"> Hurd said NHTSA investigators will analyze roll-over accidents involving the Bronco II to determine if environment, the types of drivers or the vehicle itself might have contributed to the accidents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="25"> In denying the petitions for an investigation of the Samurai, the agency said a high proportion of the roll-over victims were young, inexperienced drivers.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="26"> Alcohol consumption was evident in 50% of the accidents, NHTSA said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="27"> Allegations against the Samurai spurred calls for NHTSA to adopt roll-over standards covering all vehicles.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="29"> The Samurai, a popular product of American Suzuki Motor Corp., came under attack last June.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="30"> Consumer Reports magazine, published by Consumers Union, gave the Japanese vehicle its first "not acceptable" rating in a decade because of what the group said were basic design flaws.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="31"> The magazine said the Samurai presented an unsafe combination of a high center of gravity, a narrow tread width and a light weight.</s>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="32"> It said tests revealed that the Samurai showed a dangerous tendency to roll over when performing relatively routine maneuvers at relatively low speeds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031689-0177" num="33"> Consumers Union petitioned NHTSA for a full-scale investigation that could have led to a mandatory recall if the agency found the allegations valid.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="7"> WHEN the price-only instead of price-plus-cubic capacity tax banding comes in later this year, business motorists will no longer have to choose between an under 2-litre car and a hefty financial penalty.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="8"> Even so, there will still be every incentive to settle for an under 2-litre unless the car is a diesel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="9"> These need a larger engine to give performance on a par with that of a petrol-powered car.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="10"> The fact of the matter is that unless status means more than a combination of performance and reasonable economy, a modern, high-efficiency 2-litre engine is quite big enough.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="11"> In the under-Pounds 19,250 category, there are some excellent four-and five-seat, 2-litre business class cars about.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="12"> They have the acceleration and the unusable maximum speed of 3-litre cars of a few years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="13"> When motorway cruising they are so refined it is hard to hear any engine noise over the swish of tyres and rustle of air.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="14"> Cars of this class are so good that choosing between makes and models has more to do with looks, equipment levels, service back-up, warranty terms and key-in-hand price than actual performance.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="15"> Two factors have been concentrating the car makers' and importers' minds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="16"> These were the 2-litre tax break - soon to be swept away - and the effects of the recession on sales.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="17"> The makers' and importers' answer was to say never mind the engine size, get a load of the goodies - and the price.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="18"> There is an embarrassment of choice.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="19"> Alfa-Romeo's new front-wheel driven 155 has just come to Britain with 1.8-litre and 2-litre engines as well as a 2.5-litre V6 after making an encouraging start in Italy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="20"> It is an agreeably sporty car of individual appearance.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="21"> Citroen's XM, with it semi-active, self-levelling gas-hydraulic suspension, rides like no other car.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="22"> While not in the least quirky, it could never be mistaken for anything else.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="23"> The new XM Premiere 2.Oi has ABS brakes, alloy wheels, ultrasonic alarm and a stereo system with steering wheel controls yet it costs only Pounds 16,995.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="24"> Another Pounds 2,250 buys the 2.Oi Prestige (Pounds 19,245) which also has automatic transmission, climate control and leather upholstery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="25"> A similarly equipped, leather-trimmed, automatic version of the Fiat Croma 2.Oie SX - the only model now sold in Britain - is priced at less than Pounds 18,250.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="26"> Its two-pedal Lancia counterpart, powered by the same silken 16-valve engine with counter-rotating balance shafts, is Pounds 18,575.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="27"> These cars have essentially the same chassis platform and are of similar body size to the Saab 9000 CS and CD saloons which are among the best buys in class at less than Pounds 19,250.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="28"> These solidly built, spacious cars have light-pressure turbocharging which, exploited discreetly, gives them the flexibility and pick-up of a 3-litre six with the fuel economy of a 2-litre four.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="29"> The Audi 80, recently re-launched with a boot as generous in size as the old model's was meagre, and the Audi 100 are available in seven versions under the Pounds 19,250 tax break although, sadly, none of the Quattros with four-wheel drive squeezes under the barrier.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="30"> Like the Saabs, they combine Audi Pro-Con Ten steering column-shortening and seat belt-tightening crash protection system is unique - with the kind of handling and roadholding to please the keenest driver.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="31"> BMW's super-smooth six-cylinder 2-litre engine can be had in both 3-Series and 5-Series four-door saloons for less than Pounds 19,250.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="32"> There is a joie de vivre about these cars that few other makes can duplicate.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="33"> The comfort of the Ford Granada 2.0 LX's ride always impresses.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="34"> This large hatchback or saloon is offered with automatic transmission for less than Pounds 19,250.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="35"> Until the new Swindon-built 2-litre Honda, currently code-named Synchro, appears, the only Honda saloon in the under-Pounds 19,250 executive class is the Japan-sourced Accord.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="36"> Japanese named cars will have to be taken with increasing seriousness by user-chooser and fleet manager alike.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="37"> At the moment, the only British-built, and thus generally fleet-acceptable, Nissan is the Primera.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="38"> For mechanical refinement and build quality it has few if any class rivals and it is an extraordinarily well-balanced and pleasant car to drive.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="39"> Toyota's answer to the Primera is the new Carina E, launched in Britain with 1.6-litre and 2-litre engines in May.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="40"> For the time being, the cars are being imported from Japan but in December production starts at Burnaston, Derbyshire.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="41"> The Carina E will then be another genuinely British car even though it has a Japanese name.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="42"> Primera and Carina E both look and go remarkably like their Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra) equivalents, which still set a European standard among medium-sized, medium-priced, front wheel-driven cars.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="43"> The latest Vauxhall Cavalier Diplomat, leather-trimmed, with heated seats and standard air conditioning, is a mini-Senator available for less than Pounds 19,250 with manual transmission.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="44"> Renault's admirable 25 replacement, the Safrane, is expected to sell in Britain for a similar figure with a 2-litre engine and automatic transmission when it arrives in early autumn.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="45"> Safrane majors on ride quality and silence.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="46"> The Mercedes-Benz 190E with 1.8-litre or 2-litre engines, now nearly 10 years old and due soon for replacement, is unmatched in its price class for status and sheer merit.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="47"> Its bank-vault build quality and conservative styling pay off in high retained values.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="48"> The pleasure of driving one is to be equated with the feeling one gets when upgraded to first from business class.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="49"> The Peugeot 605 SLi 2.0, steel sprung but otherwise similar mechanically to a Citroen XM, is a roomy, quiet and undemanding drive.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="50"> Rover's 820, restyled and improved within the past year, has build quality to match that of any European rival and is a driver's car which passengers enjoy equally.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="51"> Volvo's five-cylinder, front wheel-driven 850GLT is an outstanding newcomer.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="52"> It may look rather like a mid-1980s rear drive Volvo, but everything about it is original - except, that is, the styling.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="53"> Performance is lively, the ride is good, the handling supremely safe and, should the worst happen, its crash survivability is probably unmatched.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="54"> A feature of the past year has been the appearance on the market of some new estate cars that are viable and attractive alternatives to the company saloon for business use.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="55"> Among them - all available for under Pounds 19,250 -are the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series Touring, Citroen XM and Ford Granada.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="56"> The old days when estate cars were noisier than saloons have long gone.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="57"> In none of these would one know there was a massive load space instead of a boot unless one turned around in the driving seat.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="58"> Some business drivers reckon that if the company is going to give them the choice of any car costing less than Pounds 19,250 it might as well be exactly what they want and choose a recreational four-wheel drive.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="59"> The three contenders are the Land Rover Discovery (from Pounds 18,021 for a 2.5-litre diesel) and the Japanese-made Mitsubishi Shogun (from Pounds 18,809) and Isuzu New Trooper (Pounds 15,149 upwards).</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="60"> Although designed and built to cope with off-road driving, most spend the majority - and many the whole - of their lives on tarmac.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="61"> They cannot match an executive car of similar price for fuel consumption or ride comfort and there is a certain lack of finesse about their handling.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="62"> Having said that, there is something rather attractive about their high driving position which gives a commanding view of the road.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="63"> Any of them will cruise reasonably quietly at the sort of speeds which business drivers use.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="64"> And, of course, at weekends they will tow two-horse (or one boat) trailers better than any other kind of car.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1008" num="65"> Should the need arise to tackle mud, snow or flooded roads, they are in a class of their own.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="13"> Police dispatcher Bernadette Bertsch said Johnsen was driving a white Volvo in the direction of Laguna Beach and had been seen weaving on a long straight stretch of road just before the accident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="14"> "Witnesses related that (the) vehicle. . . had been driving erratically and drove onto the shoulder of the roadway," Bertsch said, reading from a prepared release .</s>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="15"> Johnsen then apparently overcompensated and swerved left into oncoming traffic and a Ford Bronco.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="16"> The driver of the Bronco, Joseph William Smith, 28, of Santa Ana, and 2-year-old Bradley Johnson of Anaheim were taken to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center and treated for facial cuts and bruises, Sgt. Ray Lardie said.</s>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="17"> The boy's mother, Janine Johnson, 19, of Anaheim was hospitalized with a possible concussion and internal injuries, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="18"> Johnsen's death marks the first fatality this year on Laguna Canyon Road, long considered one of the most unsafe roads in the county.</s>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="19"> But the collision, unlike most others in the area, occurred on a straightaway near the center of the city, Lardie said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="20"> "The weather was clear and there were no obstructions to her vision," Lardie said, adding that Johnsen was estimated to have been driving about 35 m.p.h.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="21"> Driver safety on Laguna Canyon Road has long been an issue in Laguna Beach, prompting some residents to repeatedly lobby the City Council to beef up police patrols and make safety improvements, especially around the notorious "Big Bend," where most of the accidents have occurred.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="22"> In 1988, the City Council approved a deal with the Orange County Transportation Commission that allowed $250,000 in state money to be used for improvements on Laguna Canyon Road.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="23"> City municipal services director Terry Brandt said the money has paid for signs warning motorists of the most dangerous curves.</s>

<s docid="LA101190-0218" num="27"> Thirty injury accidents occurred this year before Tuesday night's collision, Lardie said.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="12"> The risk of being killed on the average plane trip, statistics traditionally have told us, is about 1/20th that of being killed on the highway.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="13"> As flight attendants are fond of telling passengers, the most dangerous part of their trip is the drive to the airport.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="14"> But according to a new study in the journal Risk Analysis, those statistics tell only part of the story.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="15"> Under certain conditions, the study asserts, many Americans are not more likely to survive in the air at all.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="16"> In fact, for trips up to 600 miles long, they may be better off in a car.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="17"> The findings carry a daunting list of caveats and assumptions.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="18"> For one thing, the figures apply only to dying, and do not count the risk of nonfatal injury, which all concede is much higher in a car.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="19"> Moreover, the results pertain only to certain types of drivers traveling in certain types of cars on only the safest kind of highways.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="20"> But the study -- conducted by three statisticians at General Motors led by Leonard Evans -- flies so resolutely in the face of conventional wisdom that it has generated a wave of controversy among risk assessment experts.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="21"> It also serves as a compelling illustration of why the statistics that shape human behavior can sometimes be highly misleading.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="22"> Evans's analysis is based on a simple observation about the differences between the risks of airline travel and highway travel.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="23"> The risk of being killed in a plane crash -- 0.55 fatalities per billion passenger miles flown -- is borne almost equally by everyone on the aircraft.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="24"> There are few ways for a passenger to improve the chance of living.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="25"> On the other hand, the comparable fatality rate for drivers -- 12.56, nearly 23 times as high -- is typically calculated as an average, lumping high-risk travelers -- teen-agers, madcap lane-changers and drunks -- with middle-aged accountants with four children in a large station wagon who drive so carefully they never so much as nick a fender.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="26"> The drunk's risk of dying is much higher than the average and the accountant's is much less.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="27"> What Evans argues is that for safe drivers the chances of being killed in a car accident are less than the chance of dying in a plane crash -- even if the assessments of average risk show the opposite.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="28"> Consider the effect various factors have on the risks of driving:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="29"> * Age: Eighteen-year-olds are about five times as likely to die in a car accident as is the average driver.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="30"> A 40-year-old, by contrast, has a death rate about half the average.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="31"> * Alcohol: People legally drunk behind the wheel have a fatality risk 7.66 times the norm.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="32"> Drivers who don't drink have a risk only about 60% of the norm.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="33"> * Seat belts: Wearing a seat belt cuts a driver's risk of dying on the road in half.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="34"> * Car size: Generally speaking, the bigger the car, the safer its occupants.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="35"> Drive a large, heavy car -- a Chevrolet Caprice, for example, or a Ford LTD -- and your chances of dying in an accident are 26% less than average.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="36"> Drive a compact and your death rate is about 35% higher than average.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="37"> * Road type: Traveling on a rural interstate highway is about half as dangerous as driving on smaller roads and highways.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="38"> According to Evans, people who violate every one of those safety factors -- young, drunk, un-seat-belted drivers in small cars on a winding country road -- risk a fatality rate of 930 deaths per billion miles driven.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="39"> But someone at the other end of the scale -- experienced, sober, seat-belted, driving a big car on interstate routes -- would risk 0.804 fatalities per billion miles -- a rate 1-1,157th as great.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="40"> How do the safer group's odds compare to the chances of dying in a plane crash?</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="41"> Very favorably, Evans says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="42"> The risk-per-passenger-mile, the usual way airline safety is compared to that of car travel, actually decreases with the length of trip.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="43"> This is because most plane crashes occur on takeoff or landing.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="44"> Short flights and long flights, in other words, have the same chance of crashing.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="45"> But longer flights spread those risks over many more miles, lowering the overall fatality rate for the passengers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="46"> Cars, the study concludes, can be safer than planes taking the statistically riskier shorter trips.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="47"> For a 200-mile trip, the ideal driver is four times as safe in his or her car as on a plane.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="48"> For a 300-mile trip, the car is twice as safe.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="49"> Only after 600 miles -- when airplane fatality rates fall below 0.8 deaths per billion miles -- does flying become a better alternative.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="50"> That's not all.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="51"> Evans's analysis includes only the driver of a car -- the one at greatest risk.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="52"> But passengers -- particularly those sitting in the relative safety of the back seat -- have much lower fatality rates than do drivers.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="53"> If car occupants are included, the best-case highway fatality risk sinks to 0.59 per billion miles driven, making sitting in the back seat preferable to flying for trips up to 800 miles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="54"> The assumptions do, however, come with a number of caveats.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="55"> Not everyone choosing between a plane and a car can meet all the ideal driving characteristics.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="56"> Not everyone, for example, wants to stay on interstates or has a big car available.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="57"> Driving an average-size car -- say a Ford Taurus -- under otherwise ideal circumstances increases driving risk to 1.09 per billion miles, which makes driving preferable only for trips under 500 miles.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="58"> Traveling in a compact -- which many Americans do -- pushes the risk to 1.48 per billion miles, wiping out much of the driving advantage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="59"> The analysis is also very selective because it compares only fatalities.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="60"> But on the highway, injuries are 70 times as likely as are fatalities.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="61"> If a traveler is unwilling to accept a greatly increased chance of serious injury -- even if driving brings a lower fatality rate -- then flying still makes sense.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="62"> Then there is the question of balance.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="63"> "It sounds as if the article is much more interested in decomposing the average auto trip than the average airplane trip," said Arnold Barnett, an operations research specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="64"> Barnett said that if a similar effort were made to separate out all the factors that affect airline safety, the picture would change.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="65"> The risks of flying aren't nearly as variable as those of driving, but there are some differences.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="66"> Some airports -- such as Atlanta and Dulles near Washington, D.C., -- are safer than others such as Los Angeles and San Diego.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="67"> Newer, bigger planes are less likely to crash than are smaller, older planes.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="68"> An airline passenger sitting by an emergency exit may have a better chance of survival than someone trapped in the middle of a row.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="69"> On a trip from Washington to Atlanta, is a sober 40-year-old sitting by the exit in a brand new jumbo jet still better off than behind the wheel of a Mercedes?</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0158" num="70"> Perhaps the airline industry will put forth an analysis to compare to GM's.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="6"> Next month's motor shows in Detroit and Los Angeles are expected to confirm a trend in car-buying that represents the triumph of ego over ecology, lust over logic, and cult over commonsense.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="7"> The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America show that, in the first 11 months of this year, Americans bought 5.6m of what are described as light trucks - four-wheel drive cars such as the Jeep Cherokee and Range Rover, multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) that seat seven or eight adults with car-like handling, and pick-up trucks.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="8"> These 'cult' sectors of the US market have accounted for 43 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales in 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="9"> 'It's been trucks, trucks, trucks - we can't build enough,' according to Mr John Maciarz, a spokesman for market leader General Motors.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="10"> This year, more than any other, light truck sales have outperformed the conventional car market in the US by a large and growing margin.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="11"> Sales are nearly 15 per cent higher than in the same period last year, compared with growth in car sales of just 5 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="12"> In some western US states and provinces of Canada, their sales now outnumber those of ordinary cars.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="13"> Indeed, the single best-selling vehicle in the US is not a car, but a pick-up: Ford's F-series model outsells the country's best selling car, the Ford Taurus, by a ratio of 3 to 2.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="14"> For most of their owners for most of the time, these vehicles are not ideal choices: four-wheel drives and MPVs are usually much bigger than they need; pick-ups have few passenger seats; and all three are simply irrelevant to any kind of need other than the emotional.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="15"> Most also consume far more fuel than anyone needs for basic transportation.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="16"> US vehicle makers claim to be almost as nonplussed as environmentalists by the gulf between the public support for energy and environmental conservation and the purchase of eccentric gas-guzzlers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="17"> This year, Chrysler has taken the pick-up cult to a new extreme with the Dodge Ram Laramie SLT Magnum V10.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="18"> Only three adults can squeeze into its cab; its rear load deck is open to the elements; and under its bonnet is an engine with 10 cylinders, eight litres and the ability to out-drag most sports cars.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="19"> Such eccentricity is unlikely to remain confined to the land of Dollars 1-a-gallon gasolene, however.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="20"> Chrysler's UK importer currently has one on test, assessing it for a possible niche in the European markets.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="21"> Despite several attempts by manufacturers to promote them as both leisure and utility vehicles, pick-ups have never really caught on in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="22"> In the UK, only slightly more than 3,000 are expected to be sold this year, almost all to builders and other traders.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="23"> But four-wheel drive cars are another story.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="24"> They have already provided the beachhead through which Chrysler is re-establishing itself as a manufacturer to be taken seriously in Europe, with sales of around 20,000 units a year of its Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models, some assembled at a plant in Austria.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="25"> Last year, according to statistics from market monitoring group Automotive Industry Data, Europeans bought 300,000 leisure/utility four-wheel drives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="26"> AID forecasts that sales should rise to around 500,000 by the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="27"> Japan's choked roads provide the best support available for those who contend that the European four-wheel drive market has a long way to grow.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="28"> Although the Japanese have even fewer opportunities than Europeans to take their vehicles off-road, because of greater urban sprawl and tight controls on the countryside, four-wheel drives account for 6 per cent of the new car market.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="29"> To date, their share in Europe is under 3 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="30"> According to AID, buyers justify their purchases by a desire 'to venture off-road where the mountain goat tenacity of such vehicles is likely to be needed'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="31"> AID's report on European four-wheel drive prospects to the year 2002 says that those interviewed claimed other features, such as styling, were much less important.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="32"> But the report's research into how these vehicles are used showed that most buyers had little or no need for an off-road capability.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="33"> 'The overwhelming majority of vehicle owners, around 95 per cent, are using their four-wheel drives for nothing more demanding than driving to the office, or for the daily school run'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="34"> Embarrassed though most buyers might be to admit it, AID suggests, the real reason for their purchase is simply 'to stand out from the crowd'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="35"> To underline the point, it reports that four-wheel drive owners on average were found to spend nine times as much as their car-buying counterparts on appearance-improving extras.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="36"> In terms of both purchase and running costs, four-wheel drives can be a very expensive way of being different.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="37"> In September, the UK Rover Group's subsidiary, Land Rover, launched the latest version of its flagship Range Rover model, developed as part of a four-year, Pounds 300m investment programme.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="38"> Priced at up to Pounds 44,000, it has taken the vehicles into direct competition with established luxury car producers such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota).</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="39"> The Range Rover, its cheaper stablemate the Discovery and the more utilitarian Land Rover Defender have been big success stories in the world market for four-wheel drives.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="40"> The company's output at the end of the 1980s was fewer than 50,000.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="41"> This year the total will reach a record 85,000, and the company expects to sell 100,000 units or more in the new year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="42"> With so much at stake, Land Rover executives strongly defend their four-wheel drive vehicles, maintaining they offer more than an ego trip.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="43"> The Discovery, they say, is gradually taking over the market for big estate cars, typified by Volvo, because of its commanding driving position above other traffic and multi-seat flexibility, as well as style and image.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="44"> Critics maintain that the perception of usable space is exaggerated.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="45"> They add that the current cult status of the vehicles could quickly be undermined if there is a revival in concerns over the stability of these cars, which have a high centre of gravity.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="46"> Small Suzuki four-wheel drives faced a barrage of criticisms over rollover safety in the 1980s.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="47"> More recently, the deaths of a woman and her two children in a motorway accident in the UK, when their Range Rover rolled over the central barrier into oncoming traffic, has revived industry unease over the safety image of four-wheel drive cars.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="48"> Yet manufacturers continue to crowd into the sector, and the vehicles themselves grow ever more varied.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="49"> Volvo is reported to have developed a four-wheel drive prototype; Ford may introduce its large Explorer model into Europe; and Korea's SSangyong will introduce its first four-wheel drive to Europe during 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="50"> Meanwhile, Japan's Mitsubishi has just launched a Japan-only, 600cc mini version of its popular Pajero/Shogun vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="51"> Two of Europe's biggest carmakers, Peugeot and Fiat, stand out from the trend, however, as absentees from this sector of the market.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="52"> Both Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Fiat Auto's director-general, Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, maintain that four-wheel drives will end up in a market wilderness and that the best growth prospects for niche vehicles lies with multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs).</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="53"> Their own efforts have gone into producing such a vehicle jointly, already in production as the Fiat Ulysse, Peugeot 806 and Citroen Synergie.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="54"> But for 'green' critics of Europe's current modest craze for the fuel-gulping, macho-looking four-wheel drives, the future looks bleak.</s>

<s docid="FT944-136" num="55"> The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America suggest that, short of a public outcry over their safety, there will be many more of these vehicles on Europe's roads by the end of 1995.</s>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="7"> The US government yesterday abandoned its attempts to declare unsafe some 5m pickup trucks made by General Motors in the 1980s.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="8"> Instead of recalling the trucks, at a claimed cost of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), the company will pay Dollars 51m into a research fund on traffic safety - an apparent victory for GM in a bitter two-year dispute.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="9"> The settlement ends an investigation into pickup trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks made by GM between 1973 and 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="10"> The US Department of Transportation had conceded the trucks conformed to safety standards at the time, but claimed they were not adequate for today's conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="11"> GM last month launched a lawsuit challenging the government's right to impose safety standards retrospectively.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="12"> Mr Federico Pena, secretary of transportation, said the deal was a commonsense outcome.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="13"> 'Proceeding with the recall process would have taken years in court.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="14"> During all that time the trucks subject to this investigation would have remained on our highways,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="15"> The safety research funded by GM, he said, would start to save lives immediately.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="16"> 'The alternatives were to proceed with a recall that would have involved years of litigation, an uncertain outcome and prevented few, if any deaths; or I could have closed the case, with no public benefit at all,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="17"> In October, Mr Pena had announced a preliminary finding by the Department of Transportation that there was a safety defect in GM's C/K trucks, which have externally mounted fuel tanks that could cause an explosion in a side-on crash.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="18"> The department had also scheduled a public hearing on the trucks for Tuesday, which is now cancelled.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="19"> Mr Pena had said about 150 people had died in 'otherwise survivable' side-impact crashes when their GM trucks caught fire, and had accused GM of deciding to 'favour 'sales over safety'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="20"> However, his position had been undermined by reports that he had proceeded against the advice of his own safety officials.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="21"> The issue had also been bitterly contested by Detroit, with car company chiefs last month writing a joint letter to President Bill Clinton claiming their entire industry was threatened.</s>

<s docid="FT944-5300" num="22"> GM said the deal did not affect private lawsuits still outstanding.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="8"> Four people were killed when a Chevrolet Blazer slammed into a jackknifed gasoline tanker on the San Bernardino Freeway in Claremont late Wednesday, causing a fiery explosion that left authorities with few leads Thursday as to the victims' identities.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="9"> A 36-year-old Glendora woman, whose name was not released, was believed to be at the wheel of the Blazer when it hit the twin tanker, authorities said.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="10"> The three other victims also were riding in the vehicle, police said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="11"> It will be several days before a comparison of dental records can be made to confirm the identities of the four people who were trapped in the flaming vehicle, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="12"> The tanker driver, Linzell Washington, 52, of La Puente, was uninjured in the crash, which occurred at 11:25 p.m. Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="13"> The inferno closed the freeway in both directions for several hours.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="14"> Washington told CHP officers that he was driving westbound at about 55 m.p.h. when the tanker's brakes locked and spun the rig out of control, stopping about 200 feet east of Indian Hill Boulevard, CHP spokesman Dennis Paulson said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="15"> The spin-out left the tanker jackknifed, straddling three lanes of the freeway, with the cab's headlights pointed northeast.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="16"> Paulson theorized that the driver of the oncoming Blazer "could have been distracted by the headlights" of the tanker.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="17"> Washington had left his cab to check on the damage when the Blazer struck the rear tank of the rig.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="18"> The spectacular fire that followed left authorities with few leads in trying to determine the victims' identities.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="19"> The identification of the 36-year-old Glendora woman could only be described as "tentative".</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="21"> Officials estimated the tanker had been carrying 20,000 gallons of gasoline.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="23"> The westbound lanes were opened at 6:45 a.m.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="24"> A CHP spokeswoman said it is believed that the other three victims were two teen-age boys and a child about 10 years of age.</s>

<s docid="LA122989-0063" num="25"> The younger child's sex was unknown, the spokesman said.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="7"> The US transport secretary said yesterday he would push for a compulsory recall of General Motors pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks in a move that brings to a head a long-running dispute over the vehicles' safety.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="8"> Mr Robert Pena said research carried out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that about 150 people had died in crashes involving the GM trucks as a result of the side-mounted tanks and that a further 32 more lives were likely to be lost, based on past trends.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="9"> Critics of the trucks say they have a tendency to burst into flames when involved in collisions from the side.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="10"> GM has already refused a 1993 request from the NHTSA for a voluntary withdrawal of the pick-up trucks, of which around 9m were built between 1973 and 1987 and 4.5m are still on the roads.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="11"> In a potentially damaging rebuke of GM management, Mr Pena also said the carmaker was aware of the alleged design flaw 'possibly as early as the mid-1970s but certainly by the 1980s'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="12"> Despite this, the company 'chose not to alter the design for 15 years', he said, adding that the GM management in place at the time 'appears to have made a decision favouring sales over safety'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="13"> After 1987 GM redesigned the vehicle to locate the fuel tanks inside the main frame.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="14"> GM responded angrily to Mr Pena's comments, claiming his verdict was 'totally unjustified'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="15"> It would fight a recall, if necessary in court, and said 'the suggestion that GM puts sales ahead of safety is outrageous and wrong'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="16"> The announcement comes 18 months after the transport secretary took the unusual step of intervening personally to review the case in the absence of a full-time administrator of the NHTSA.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="17"> His decision sets the stage for public hearings on the matter on December 6, after which a final view will be taken on whether to order a compulsory recall.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="18"> Yesterday's announcement was the transport secretary's initial decision having reviewed the evidence put to him by the NHTSA.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="19"> He will take a final decision based on evidence from interested parties at the public hearing.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="20"> The direct harm to GM from such a recall could be minimal, since the US authorities' decision would only apply to vehicles made within the past eight years.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="21"> However, it would hand valuable ammunition to lawyers attempting to extract settlements from the carmaker under product liability suits.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="22"> Last year a federal court approved a settlement under which GM was to offer discount vouchers to owners of the pick-up trucks, enabling them to buy new GM trucks for Dollars 1,000 less than the list price.</s>

<s docid="FT944-15615" num="23"> That agreement, however, has since been thrown out by state courts in Texas and Georgia.</s>
