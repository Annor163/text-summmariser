<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="9"> Stolen Words: Forays into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism by Thomas Mallon (Ticknor & Fields: $18.95; 283 pages).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="10"> Back when there were half a dozen Democrats vying for the 1988 presidential nomination, Sen. Joseph F. Biden was the first to come unstuck.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="11"> The unsticking was accomplished by the revelation that a particularly fine campaign speech of his had plagiarized an even finer speech by the leader of Britain's Labor Party, Neil Kinnock.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="12"> Biden, who is head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, seems to have suffered no long-term ill effects.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="13"> He was even able to present Kinnock, some time later, with a copy of his own speeches and an invitation to the Labor leader to feel free to borrow anything he wanted.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="14"> But then, Thomas Mallon reflects in "Stolen Words"?</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="15"> "Politics is not so serious and dirty a business as literature".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="16"> Mallon is a writer who possesses grace and wit, a delight in incongruity, and a quickness to love hard, and grow furious.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="17"> The grace, the wit, the incongruity-spotter and the love were all evident in "A Book of One's Own," his marvelously beguiling account of literary diaries.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="18"> All these qualities are present in Mallon's book on literary plagiarism, except that the love is pretty much replaced by the fury.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="19"> He thought of calling it "Not A Book of One's Own," but changed his mind, which seems a pity.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="20"> Instead, he calls it "Stolen Words," as if to signal that he was feeling angry and not playful.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="21"> Mallon, I expect, will never not be playful; but his rage is useful.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="22"> Plagiarism is the vacuum that nature abhors; it is a quiet, chilly, excavating vice, like picking one's nose when nobody is looking.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="23"> It takes Mallon's fieriness, even if it sometimes seems excessive, to get us to pay attention.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="24"> One of the characteristics of plagiarism, in fact, is that there is a certain tendency to excuse it.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="25"> Writers began to complain seriously about it, or defend themselves against it, around the time of Shakespeare -- nobody minded Virgil borrowing from Homer -- but almost immediately, Mallon finds the denouncers denounced as petty-minded.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="26"> In two of the three cases he studies in detail -- he uses each of these chapters to weave in other examples along with general reflections -- he discovers a reluctance to confront a fact, and a tendency to minimize it.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="27"> Like rape, he writes, it is a crime with the odd ability to make others feel guilty.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="28"> There is a detailed and absorbing study of a professor at Texas Tech who repeatedly used others' material, and who was allowed quietly to resign, even though some of his colleagues wanted some more energetic action.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="29"> The man involved -- Mallon names him as Jayme Sokolov -- eventually published his disputed version in a somewhat revised version and, when complaints of plagiarism persisted, wrote notes of apology in the American Historical Assn.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="30"> Journal and inserted errata slips in the remaining volumes.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="31"> Mallon's point is the lack of public denunciation by the professor's peers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="32"> Then there was "Wild Oats," by Jacob Epstein, a comic novel about the enthusiasms and predicaments of an American college student, which appeared in 1980.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="33"> It was praised by several prominent writers.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="34"> Perhaps too snidely, Mallon gives the impression that some of the praise was due to the fact that Jacob's parents were influential editors; he does not deny the author's talent.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="35"> A considerable scandal resulted when the English novelist, Martin Amis, wrote an article citing half a dozen highly distinctive passages that were almost identical to passages in his own well-praised "The Rachel Papers," published in 1974.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="36"> Mallon quotes them.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="37"> There were 53 such passages in all, Amis complained.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="38"> The British author seems to have made his disclosure reluctantly, and Mallon writes that he still rather regrets it.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="39"> Amis' own publisher, Corlies Smith -- who, one might have thought, would have been outraged -- suggested that the affair had been overplayed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="40"> Mallon supplies anger for both of them.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="41"> It is beside the point, he writes, that the two books were different in spirit and tone, and that much of Jacob's book was original.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="42"> That is like saying that although 50 stolen items are found in a burglar's house, 2,000 items were not stolen.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="43"> And, he adds in wicked deadpan: "The books don't feel, overall, very much alike.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="44"> It's just that they are, sometimes, exactly the same".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="45"> Once or twice, I find Mallon persnickety in citing transgressions.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="46"> And there is the borderline case of "Tristram Shandy," whose author, Laurence Sterne, got a good many of Uncle Toby's sayings from Richard Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="47"> Mallon grants that "Tristram" is an extraordinary original, but he takes issue with scholarly indulgence, and the argument that readers would recognize the Burton adages.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="48"> Sterne, he said, got a free ride.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="49"> He has a point; but what is the alternative?</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="50"> Could Uncle Toby really be expected to put footnotes in his mouth?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="51"> By and large, though, his distinctions are fair.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="52"> Not citing the authorship of a well-known phrase is legitimate.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="53"> "After all, one could put an end to literary allusion if one feared the footnote police behind every punctuation mark".</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="54"> Self-plagiarizing is generally OK.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="55"> "No writer wants his work to have just one temporary or inconspicuous life".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="56"> And stylistic influence, or "osmosis" is more than OK.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="57"> Joan Didion, he is sure, was influenced early on by Hemingway's sentences.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="58"> He knows that he himself was influenced by Didion.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="59"> "No one will ever amount to anything unless his early reading leaks into his first writing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="60"> Plagiarism is not, mainly or necessarily, using plots or situations that others have used.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="61"> It is, necessarily and always, using their words, unattributed.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="62"> Word-stealing is the fuel to Mallon's fire; it is unforgivable.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="63"> Writers write above all more for identity than for money, he tells us.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="64"> You can bear your wallet being stolen so long as you keep the photographs.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="65"> Losing one's words means losing one's self-respect.</s>

<s docid="LA102689-0011" num="66"> "If ego stopped mattering, then, very likely, writers would stop writing or at least, stop writing so frequently and so well".</s>

<s docid="LA010790-0054" num="9"> Wilbert Rideau and Billy Wayne Sinclair, convicted murderers with a bent for writing, won fame in the late 1970s and early '80s with articles in the Louisiana State Penitentiary magazine The Angolite.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010790-0054" num="10"> But the writings that concern them today include legal briefs filed in Sinclair's $100,000 federal lawsuit against Rideau, accusing him of plagiarism in a book he edited and of trying to damage Sinclair's journalistic reputation.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="6"> MR Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), said yesterday he would sue for libel over accusations of plagiarism and inaccuracy in his new book about the early Mitterrand years.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="7"> Mr Attali said yesterday he would sue the weekly magazine, Le Nouvel Observateur, for alleging that his new 960-page book, Verbatim, recording Mr Francois Mitterrand's time at the Elysee between 1981 and 1986, had plagiarised conversations which the president had had with Mr Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace prize-winning American author.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="8"> Mr Attali told a radio station that 'at my initiative, the president had some conversations with Elie Wiesel which were broken off and were never the subject of a contract with any publisher or of any written work'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="9"> 'The two men are no longer under any obligation to each other.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="10"> The president authorised me to use what he had said in my book, and Elie Wiesel told me he intended to do the same in his own memoirs,' Mr Attali, who was President Mitterrand's closest aide during the 1980s, said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="11"> Le Nouvel Observateur said last night it had not yet received any legal writ from Mr Attali or his lawyer.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="12"> Mrs Odile Jacob, a leading French publisher, had intended to publish the conversations as a book later this year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="13"> Mr Attali said the president had proof-read Verbatim line by line.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="14"> Mr Attali has been under fire recently over the amount spent on fitting out the EBRD headquarters in London.</s>

<s docid="FT932-8211" num="15"> The international governors' board of the EBRD has ordered an audit into the spending.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="18"> As Far as Destroying These Weapons, It Is as Difficult as Creating Them"] [Text] One year ago, Russia was among the first countries to sign in Paris the Convention on Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="19"> This event completed the proceedings of more than two decades of negotiations at the disarmament conference in Geneva.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="20"> The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which is headquartered in the Hague (the Netherlands) was created in order to carry out the convention and implement an international control mechanism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="21"> In Russia, the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons was also created in 1992 by an edict of the Russian Federation president.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="22"> The committee was charged with the functions of coordination and control in the area of ensuring compliance with Russia's international obligations concerning the ban on chemical and biological weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="23"> Professor Aleksandr Gorbovskiy, chief of the department for the issues of chemical weapons of the committee, answers questions put by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="24"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Aleksandr Dmitriyevich, what is the status of implementing the convention as of today?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="25"> Gorbovskiy: The convention has been signed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="26"> A period of two years has been set for participating countries to be able to ratify it and prepare to meet their obligations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="27"> The convention will take effect when no fewer than 65 states ratify it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="28"> The convention has now been signed by 154 states, but ratified by only four countries, which do not have chemical weapons and which actually do not have to assume any obligations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="29"> This is a very serious problem for other countries that do have such weapons: The conditions and facilities for the destruction of chemical weapons need to be created.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="30"> The main proportion of the world stockpiles of such weapons are concentrated in the United States and Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="31"> This is why the issue of destroying chemical weapons is the most acute for these two states.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="32"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What does the Russian chemical weapons complex amount to?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="33"> One finds absolutely contradictory information in the press.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="34"> Gorbovskiy: The Russian chemical weapons complex means first of all the stockpiles kept at storage facilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="35"> The total quantity of the stockpiles has been declared and comes to 40,000 tonnes of toxic substances (OV).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="36"> Russia also has facilities for the production of toxic substances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="37"> The principal facilities are in Volgograd and Novocheboksarsk (Chuvashia).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="38"> Last year an interdepartmental commission whose task it was to inspect all storage facilities for toxic substances verified the reliability of chemical weapons storage and provisions for the safety of the population.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="39"> As chairman of the above commission, I can confirm the number given--40,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="40"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Is it possible to say what the qualitative composition of these 40,000 tonnes is, and in which regions Russian chemical weapons are mostly located?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="41"> Gorbovskiy: The most up-to-date nerve substances--sarin, soman, and V-gas [vi-gaz], account for approximately 32,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="42"> The remainder consists of obsolete substances, mustard gas and lewisite, which have been stored since as early as the 1950's.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="43"> Data on the geography of the locations of such weapons are no longer secret.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="44"> We have exchanged information with the Americans on the military-chemical facilities; the geographical coordinates of their locations precise to the second have been provided.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="45"> All these facilities are located in the European section of Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="46"> We have seven storage sites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="47"> Toxic substances (mustard gas, lewisite) are kept in containers at two sites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="48"> Storage is within munitions at five sites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="49"> Two storage facilities out of these five hold missile and artillery munitions, and three storage sites--aircraft chemical munitions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="50"> The easternmost facility is in Chelyabinsk Oblast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="51"> Those in Bryansk and Penza Oblasts are the closest to Moscow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="52"> The 40,000 tonnes are distributed among these storage facilities approximately evenly--at 5,000-7,000 tonnes per storage site.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="53"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the guaranteed shelf life of chemical munitions?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="54"> Gorbovskiy: More than 80 percent of toxic substances are found within munitions whose bodies ensure their reliable storage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="55"> The inspection of arsenals revealed that a case of leakage has not been registered at any of them recently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="56"> American chemical munitions have thinner shells.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="57"> This is precisely why their chemical munitions have become disabled sooner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="58"> For example, rocket artillery munitions "leaked" by the mid-1970's.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="59"> The Americans were forced to encase them in concrete and dump them in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="60"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is 40,000 tonnes equal to in terms of, so to say, destruction coefficient?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="61"> Gorbovskiy: A lethal dose of V-gas, the most up-to-date chemical toxic agent, comes to 10 milligrams per person.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="62"> This is a virtually invisible aerosol particle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="63"> It is easy to calculate the number of potential victims by simple division if we know the total stockpiles of chemical weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="64"> However, this would be an incompetent calculation; it does not take into account actual conditions for the use of all weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="65"> For example, if we compare how much explosive was used during World War II and the number of people who were destroyed, it will turn out that there were hundreds of kilograms of trinitrotoluene per person killed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="66"> The same is the case in the event of combat use of chemical weapons--kilograms and tens of kilograms of toxic substances per each casualty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="67"> Approximately the same casualty rate should also be reckoned with during accidents.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="68"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What are the specifics of Russian problems associated with implementation of the provisions of the convention?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="69"> Gorbovskiy: Unfortunately we have to begin work in the area of chemical weapons destruction virtually from scratch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="70"> After the former USSR announced the discontinuation of chemical weapons production (1987), a facility for the destruction of toxic substances was created in the vicinity of the city of Chapayevsk within a very short period of time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="71"> About 100 million rubles in 1989 prices were spent to this end.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="72"> However, this facility was not commissioned, after all.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="73"> The local population protested strongly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="74"> Technologies that were supposed to be used at the facility were evaluated to be safer than American technologies even by specialists from the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="75"> Many other industrial enterprises are located in Chapayevsk, and the ecological situation in the region was very strained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="76"> There was absolutely no opportunity to coordinate the commissioning of the facility with the local authorities and the public.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="77"> Subsequently, major studies were done to develop a draft of the state program for the destruction of chemical weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="78"> As a result, specialists came to the conclusion that it would be safest and most economical to use for destruction available former facilities for the production of toxic substances; after all, in this case the entire infrastructure did not have to be created from scratch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="79"> In particular, a plant in the city of Novocheboksarsk was proposed (the V-gas toxic substance had been produced there previously).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="80"> However, following discussion of a draft program at the beginning of last year, the legislative organ of Chuvashia made a decision which ruled out the use of the Novocheboksarsk Production Association Khimprom for the purpose of destroying a proportion of the stock of chemical weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="81"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the price tag on the program for the destruction of chemical weapons?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="82"> Gorbovskiy: It is very expensive--a few trillion rubles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="83"> The following concept is now taking shape: Chemical weapons will have to be destroyed directly in the area of the facilities at which they are stored.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="84"> A major effort to coordinate all issues with the local organs of power and the public lies ahead.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="85"> In conjunction with this, certain articles of an instigatory and even intimidating nature seriously harm an objective assessment of the situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="86"> Thus, one year ago articles appeared in the newspapers of the Republic of Chuvashia about V-gas contamination in a 30-kilometer zone around Novocheboksarsk.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="87"> The interdepartmental commission dispatched there for a survey did not confirm this fact.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="88"> Analysis of the samples of various media made in specialized laboratories indicated an absence of contamination.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="89"> One more dangerous trend has begun to manifest itself--to combine the program for the destruction of chemical weapons with the resolution of ecological problems associated with the operation of industry as such.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="90"> All this causes the program to become still more expensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="91"> As a result, a situation might develop in which Russia will be simply unable to carry out the program on time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="92"> Meanwhile, according to the convention, the first facility for the destruction of toxic substances should already be in operation two years after the convention is ratified.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="93"> In five years, 20 percent of the chemical weapons should be destroyed, in seven years--50 percent, and in 10 years--100 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="94"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: More than a year ago MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI published the notorious article by Vil Mirzoyanov and Lev Fedorov "Poisoned Politics".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="95"> The trial of one of the authors of the article began on Monday.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="96"> He stands accused of divulging state secrets with regard to the development of a new type of chemical weapon in our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="97"> Could you comment on the situation?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="98"> Gorbovskiy: At one point I, as a representative of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems, provided explanations at a briefing concerning charges by Mirzoyanov and Fedorov that Russia is violating the international obligations it has assumed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="99"> I confirm officially that Russia has not violated any international agreements in the area of the ban on chemical weapons, either at the time this article was written or at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="100"> Since the production of toxic substances was discontinued in 1987, by the USSR, it has not resumed; the plants were either mothballed or their output mix was changed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="101"> I am certain that the American side is also well aware of this: U.S. specialists have visited former Russian facilities for the production of chemical weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="102"> Besides, there are satellite monitoring systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="103"> Incidentally, the Americans themselves, precisely in 1987, embarked on the industrial manufacturing of binary weapons--the outcome of the program for modernizing their chemical weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="104"> It is precisely binary chemical weapons that are the hardest to control within the framework of the convention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="105"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What can you say about the charges that new types of chemical weapons are being developed in Russia?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="106"> Does the fact that the Novichok-5 new chemical agent has been developed conform to the truth?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="107"> Gorbovskiy: This problem falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation rather than our committee.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="108"> Legally, not a single state is banned from such activities at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="109"> This ban will only apply to countries that have ratified the convention once it takes effect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="110"> It is known that research on binary chemical weapons has been conducted in many countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="111"> The experience gained by chemical scientists is now being used to create international monitoring mechanisms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="112"> Besides, the length of time between a reaction in a test tube and the creation of weapons is many years or even decades.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="113"> If disclosure of information on methods for the generation of toxic substances has occurred, this is undoubtedly a dangerous path leading to the uncontrollable spread of chemical weapons and the emergence of chemical terrorism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="114"> NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: The article "Poisoned Politics" was written by two authors--Mirzoyanov [spelling of name as published] and Fedorov.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="115"> Nonetheless, at present only Mirzoyanov is on trial.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="116"> What is this about?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="117"> Gorbovskiy: As far as I know, Mirzoyanov worked with secret information at the GosNIIOKhT [State Union Scientific-Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology] and, naturally, signed a pledge not to divulge state secrets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="118"> This is why charges were filed against him.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="119"> As far as Fedorov is concerned, he proclaims that he has never read secret documents anywhere nor has he signed any pledges.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="120"> This begs the following question: What does Fedorov stand for as a specialist?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="121"> Here is the opinion of him by scientists who know his past activities well.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="122"> Lev Fedorov received his college education at the department of chemistry of Moscow State University while being the party organizer of the class, with all requisite privileges for study existing at the time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="123"> Subsequently, there was graduate study and defense of a candidate dissertation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="124"> However, some time later it came out that the results of his work could not be confirmed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="125"> His science adviser experienced major unpleasantness because of that.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="126"> The first defense of a doctoral dissertation by Fedorov before the Learned Council of the imeni A.N.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="127"> Nesmeyanov Institute of Element-Organic Compounds failed for an altogether simple reason--plagiarism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="128"> Scientific statements which the author passed off as his turned out to have been borrowed from the works of domestic and foreign scientists.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="129"> Several years ago, having failed to achieve particular scientific success, Lev Fedorov suddenly took an intense interest in dioxins (organic compounds containing chlorine which are the byproducts of certain chemical production processes and pose a certain danger to humans).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="130"> Lacking his own scientific-practical works on this issue at the time, Fedorov nonetheless mounted vigorous activities in this area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="131"> Mistaking him for a dioxin specialist, the scientific community of the city of Ufa invited Fedorov to participate in the development of the Republic Program for the Evaluation of Dioxin Contamination of the Natural Environment in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="132"> Strangely, this specialist did not make any practically significant proposals, and refused to serve on the commission after the very first meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21513" num="133"> Undoubtedly, incompetent people such as Lev Fedorov should not be commenting on an important area such as the problem of chemical disarmament.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="8"> Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized or inadequately credited other authors' works in his doctoral dissertation and other college writings, according to a Stanford University history professor appointed by King's widow to edit the papers of the civil rights leader.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="9"> As a result of that finding, by Clayborne Carson at Stanford and by other researchers, Boston University is reviewing whether King's 1955 doctoral degree in theology should be revoked retroactively.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="10"> But officials said that such a drastic step is unlikely.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="11"> Carson and King's associates in the civil rights movement said Friday that the discovery of plagiarism by King in his student days, no matter how disturbing to strict scholars, should not detract from later achievements of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="12"> "I think what it shows is that there was an earlier stage in King's life when there were other goals in his mind.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="13"> He wanted to succeed as a student of theology and he wasn't practicing to be the Martin Luther King who has become a kind of national icon," Carson said in a telephone interview.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="14"> "He was just a flesh-and-blood human being with flaws and limitations".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="15"> The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Atlanta-based organization King once led, said: "We're impressed by Martin Luther King's footprints and are willing to forgive any youthful errors in his footnotes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="16"> Carson, an expert in the history of black Americans' struggle against bias, said the findings of plagiarism in the dissertation and other student writings by King were emotionally "draining" for him and other researchers.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="17"> "There is very little elation about this kind of discovery.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="18"> But I wouldn't be a historian if I didn't think it's better to know than not to," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="19"> The interim president of Boston University, Jon Westling, said the allegations of plagiarism "merit close scrutiny" and he appointed a committee of scholars to look into the matter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="20"> "Thirty-five years ago, as now, the university's standards for the proper use and attribution of scholarly sources were strict, explicit and explicitly made known to all graduate students," Westling said.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="21"> But, he added, to investigate allegations against a dead man unable to defend "any misleading appearances" will be difficult.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="22"> King was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="23"> The findings have delayed an ambitious plan to edit and publish all of King's papers in 14 volumes.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="24"> The first two volumes, covering King's life until just before the start of the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1955, were to be published this year.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="25"> But now all the papers are being scrutinized for possible borrowing and are not expected to be published until 1992, complete with annotations showing similarities to others' works.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="26"> The King papers project is sponsored by the Martin Luther King Jr.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="27"> Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and is conducted in association with Stanford, Emory University and the University of California Press.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="28"> Staff members of the King papers project first became aware in 1988 of insufficiently credited similarities between some of King's academic papers and other writers' texts.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="29"> How to address the issue reportedly caused much debate at the King Center last year.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="30"> A spokesman at the King Center declined comment Friday and said King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who appointed Carson as top editor, wanted the Stanford professor to handle any press inquiries about the matter.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="31"> Carson said Friday that he had planned to discuss the findings in a history journal article next year but decided to talk publicly after the Wall Street Journal published an article Friday about the controversy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="32"> Ralph Luker, the project's associate editor, said Friday that he would not attach the word plagiarism to King's writings but would let others reach their own conclusions.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="33"> "Plagiarism is a charge and I am not making such a charge," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="34"> Yet Luker, who works out of Emory University in Atlanta, said that he "had lost sleep" over the findings and that several graduate students quit the project because "the research was to some extent spiritually enervating".</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="35"> King himself donated many of his writings to Boston University six years before his assassination, but Mrs.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="36"> King is suing to retrieve those documents.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="37"> According to Carson, that donation shows that King probably felt no guilt about his scholarly work and was not trying to hide any plagiarism.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="38"> King's dissertation, entitled "A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman," presented some of Tillich's ideas in passages nearly identical to Tillich's but did not credit him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="39"> But that is not the worst of academic sins, because those sections were clearly intended to represent the views of Tillich, an influential Protestant theologian who died in 1965.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="40"> Worse, in the view of most universities' standards, was King's appropriation of works by other writers about Tillich, including a 1952 doctoral dissertation by another Boston University student.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="41"> In his own thesis, King cited that dissertation by Jack Boozer in the general bibliography but did not credit Boozer for particular passages.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="42"> "What we can say is by the strict definition of plagiarism, which is the appropriation of words or phrases, there are instances of plagiarism in King's papers," Carson said.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="43"> "But in most of the cases, the sources were. . . in the bibliography or on another page" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="44"> The revelation about King's student writings may be viewed by some as another dent in his image.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="45"> For example, last year, King's former close associate, the Rev.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="46"> Ralph David Abernathy, published a book which included details about King's extramarital sex life.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="47"> Abernathy, who died in April, said he did not expect his account to diminish King's stature.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="48"> On Friday, Lowery, who had disputed parts of Abernathy's book, urged the public not to think any less of King as a result of the plagiarism issue.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="49"> "Sometimes those who are in a high level of scholarship become so involved with technical secondary issues that they overlook the substantial issues," Lowery said in a phone interview.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="50"> Carson's project has not yet researched King's later and more famous writings and speeches.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="51"> But other scholars have noted similarities in those to works by other ministers and social activists.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="52"> Juan Williams, author of "Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years," the 1987 book tied to the PBS television series of the same name, said there is "no doubt" that King or the aides who helped write his speeches sometimes borrowed from others' words.</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="53"> To say otherwise, he said Friday, would be "intellectual dishonesty".</s>

<s docid="LA111090-0102" num="54"> But Williams, now a Washington Post reporter, emphasized that focusing on this aspect of King's work was petty, and he feared it will be used by "people who haven't gotten over the fact that King was such a great man and that we are a changed society in large part because of him".</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="9"> In the San Diego Tribune newsroom, staffers are questioning their editors' definition of plagiarism when it involves press releases, after a recent incident involving a real-estate reporter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="10"> A few weeks ago, a story on Los Angeles redevelopment with Trib real estate reporter Herb Lawrence's byline was killed by editors when it was discovered to be extremely similar to an article that ran in a small Los Angeles business magazine.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="11"> Later it was learned that the story in the magazine, as well as Lawrence's story, were derived from a press release.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="12"> The story didn't run, and Tribune management apparently took no formal action against Lawrence.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="13"> A veteran of more than 20 years with the paper, and its former building editor, Lawrence was suspended for a week in 1982 after he lifted large sections of a story from an article in an architectural magazine, according to published reports at the time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="14"> Sources in the newsroom said that much of the redevelopment story was taken verbatim from the press release.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="15"> Lawrence declined to comment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="16"> "There is disenchantment far and wide in the newsroom over this," said one Trib staffer.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="17"> "We'd like an accounting of what occurred and how it was handled.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="18"> If it was plagiarism, does management condone plagiarism"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="19"> Tribune Deputy Editor Bob Witty refused to discuss specifics of the Lawrence case, but he acknowledged that an accusation of plagiarism was recently presented to him.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="20"> Material from a press release was used "liberally," Witty said, but it was not a case of plagiarism.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="21"> "If you look up the definition of plagiarism, it is the unauthorized use of someone's material," Witty said.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="22"> "When someone sends you a press packet, you're entitled to use everything in there".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="23"> In general, Witty said, press releases are helpful as background, but it is "sloppy to take things too much from releases".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="24"> Certainly, public relations people don't mind their material being used in articles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="25"> "I take that almost as flattery," one public relations veteran said.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="26"> "I'd be in hog heaven if all my press releases were used verbatim".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="27"> The standard industry philosophy, echoed by Witty, is that press releases should be used only as background information for stories.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="28"> But such general guidelines are sometimes ignored.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="29"> Quotes are taken from releases without being identified as prepared statements.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="30"> Phrases from releases are used in bylined stories.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="31"> Reporters, especially on small papers, simply rewrite press releases and put their names on the new product, adding little or no new information.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="32"> "I'm an absolutist," said Don Sneed, professor of journalism at San Diego State University.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="33"> "You can't be a little pregnant.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="34"> If you're going to take a paragraph from a press release, it's wrong.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="35"> If you're going to take a handful of words, that's wrong".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="36"> Certainly all papers use rewritten press releases, without bylines, especially as briefs in real-estate and business sections.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="37"> Some, especially understaffed weekly papers, commonly insert press releases into the paper, without bylines, as news or informational stories.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="38"> But there are gray areas.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="39"> For example, what if a reporter rewrites a press release and adds just a sprinkling of new information?</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="40"> Is it fair to give the reporter a byline on the story?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="41"> "The question in this case is, is he giving readers the good faith they deserve"? said Lee Brown, another San Diego State professor.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="42"> "In my view, to claim for your own work that is not yours is not playing fair with the readers".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="43"> Until recent times, public relations representatives often would develop stories for the real-estate sections of many newspapers, supplying reporters with quotes and detailed information.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="44"> But times are changing.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="45"> At the San Diego Union, for instance, there was a change in editors two years ago, the real-estate department's staff was increased, the section's emphasis was moved away from commercial real-estate news, and the policy toward press release information was dramatically changed to eliminate the verbatim use of press releases.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="46"> This created a furor among public relations practitioners, some of whom talked of boycotting the section.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="47"> Now, the Union's real-estate section's policy is to attribute the source if a quote or information is used from a press release, according to Lizanne Poppens, news editor of the Union's Home section.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="48"> "It was probably commonplace to have more of an industry approach to real-estate news in real-estate sections throughout the country," local public relations veteran Jim Frampton said.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="49"> "About 10 years ago, the trend began throughout the industry toward more consumer-oriented sections.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="50"> There was less of a reason to quote Joe Blow from XYZ Builders on the economy," precipitating a de-emphasis of press release-supplied information.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="51"> The use of press release information in stories has been questioned in the Tribune newsroom in the past.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="52"> A year ago, a columnist was accused of copying a few paragraphs from a press release.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="53"> The Lawrence case has simply raised the topic again.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="54"> "To do nothing about it reaffirms reporters' laziness" toward press releases, one Tribune staffer said.</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="57"> KROQ's ratings have been foundering lately, and it is facing a stern new challenge from KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio).</s>

<s docid="LA071789-0021" num="58"> Reeb replaces Tony Berardini, who remains vice president of the station, as well as general manager of KROQ's sister station in Boston.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="14"> Instead, Leader, a lecturer in English at London's Roehampton Institute, raises a series of questions about writer's block: "At what point -- and why -- did the term come into existence, and what were the terms it replaced?</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="15"> How was it to be distinguished from the sorts of difficulties most writers encounter in the act of composition?</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="16"> When, in other words, did a problem with writing become a block"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="17"> Leader looks for answers in psychology and literary history, "but also in a long philosophical tradition of distrust of the written word as well as in more general social and cultural speculation".</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="18"> He covers a great deal of very rugged ground, quoting an eclectic assortment of thinkers, ranging from Plato and Melville to Mark Twain and Julia Kristeva.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="19"> The term "writers block" was coined in 1947 by Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="20"> Edmund Bergler, a largely ignored but extremely prolific psychoanalyst who published 25 books and more than 300 articles before his death in 1962.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="21"> By then the phrase had entered the language, spread by word of mouth, a sign of a time in America of intense faith in psychoanalysis and intense psychoanalytic interest in creativity.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="22"> These origins explain "the air of medical substance, of a treatable condition, assumed by writer's block; hence also the suspicion of something bogus or unearned about its claims".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="23"> Because of its connection to a particular place and time, a writer like Philip Roth might think of himself as blocked, while Philip Larkin, who wrote no more than four poems a year, simply considered himself unprolific.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="24"> Earlier writers "dried up" or "froze" or were "stuck in a rut," metaphors that imply internal deficiency, rather than external impediment, as the source of the trouble.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="25"> Locating this outside the individual shifts responsibility away from the self.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="28"> The complaint entered literary history in the 18th Century, according to one theory, when modern technology -- paper and the press -- inundated writers with the work of their betters.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="29"> Since Shakespeare and Milton are tough acts to follow, Romantic poets suffered from "the remorseless deepening of self-consciousness before the rich and intimidating legacy of the past".</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="30"> They lost the power to write, and made that a subject of literature.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="31"> When truly stuck, they invented the fragment as a poetic form.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="32"> The new self-consciousness of the mid-18th Century also may be interpreted as just one episode in the recurring history of writerly difficulty, which goes back at least to the acedia suffered by medieval authors.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="33"> Then as now, it was considered a sin, although an unenjoyable one.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="34"> The book also focuses on various psychoanalytic explanations of creative inhibition, emphasizing Freud, several post-Freudians and especially the British Object-Relations school, which explains blockage in terms of unresolved conflict between the primitive internal forces involved in self-differentiation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="35"> Leader stresses the affinities between post-Kleinian theory and the testimony of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the great bards of blockage.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="36"> He analyzes a number of Wordsworth texts -- including the first 285 lines of the "Prelude," which are explicitly about being unable to write -- and details the extravagant agonies that led Coleridge to plagiarism and worse.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="37"> Coleridge's poetry, particularly "Dejection: An Ode," documents his struggles, as do his notebooks and letters.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="38"> In one of many tormented moments, the poet wrote a friend, "I wish I had been a tanner".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="39"> After his consideration of these psychological, historical, and literary aspects of his subject, Leader adds a sociological dimension with a discussion of the cultural taboos that may produce blockage, devoting a chapter to women writers and theories about them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="40"> This approach is coherent but arbitrary, since the themes that emerge are dictated by the author's choices.</s>

<s docid="LA123090-0003" num="41"> These reflect his interests and a predilection for complexity, as when he summarily dismisses non-psychoanalytic psychology as "theoretically threadbare".</s>

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="5"> Sir David Napley was the most high-profile solicitor in Britain, celebrated for the famous cases he took on and for his masterful advocacy.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="6"> He was lauded by the legal profession as the most distinguished solicitor of his generation, but also attracted hostility from barristers who felt he usurped their role.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="7"> The list of those he represented reads like a potted history of causes celebres of the last 20 years.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="8"> It includes politicians such as Mr Jeremy Thorpe and Mr Harvey Proctor, Princess Michael of Kent and murderer Jeremy Bamber.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="9"> Born the son of a London stockbroker in July 1915, David Napley was educated at Burlington College, Essex.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="10"> He founded the now prominent legal practice of Kingsley Napley in 1937.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="11"> He joined the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1940 and was commissioned into the Indian Army in 1941.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="12"> After contracting a mystery illness, he was invalided out in 1945 with the rank of captain.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="13"> He sought advice whether to aim for the Bar or to remain a solicitor and was told by a senior judge to go for the more mundane life of a solicitor.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="14"> Too late he discovered his talent for advocacy, although in later years he said he had no regrets about the decision.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="15"> He was elected to the council of the Law Society in 1962 and was chairman of the Law Society criminal law committee from 1963 until 1975.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="16"> He became president of the Law Society in 1976-77 and was knighted in 1977.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="17"> It was Sir David's defence of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe on charges of incitement and conspiracy to murder in 1978 that thrust him to fame.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="18"> In 1986 he acted for Princess Michael of Kent.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="19"> He negotiated an out-of-court settlement after the princess was accused of plagiarism in her book, 'Crowned in a Far Country'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="20"> In 1989 he was brought in as a solicitor for Guinness to help with the Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the takeover of Distillers.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="21"> Consequently he figured prominently in the trial of Guinness chief executive Mr Ernest Saunders.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="22"> He also represented families of victims involved in the Zeebruge Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster, the Lockerbie air crash and the King's Cross fire.</s>

<s docid="FT943-953" num="23"> He leaves his wife Leah, whom he married in 1940, and two daughters.</s>

<TEXT>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="10"> Reading Richard Holmes' award-winning biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge felt something like meeting face-to-face a person with whom I have worked long-distance for years.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="11"> Here he is, with all of his faults and all of his wit, all of his astounding intellectual power, and above all with his richly engaging personality: Coleridge -- the great Romantic poet and literary critic, the theologian, the political theorist.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="12"> Holmes plays his hand openly: He has written a courageous and tough-minded book.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="13"> As he points out, "No biographer, since James Dyke Campbell in 1894, has tried to examine (Coleridge's) entire life in a broad and sympathetic manner, and to ask the one vital question: What made Coleridge -- for all his extravagant panoply of faults -- such an extraordinary man, such an extraordinary mind?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="14"> The most radical thing about the present book -- the first of two volumes -- is simply that it is a defence of Coleridge in these terms".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="15"> Offhand, that may not seem so radical, but in our times as in his own, Coleridge has provoked both hyperbolic praise and bitter condemnation.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="16"> In this context, Holmes' work is indeed radical because he does not blink at Coleridge's faults, and yet he values both Coleridge's character and his achievements fairly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="17"> To do so, Holmes has had to bridge gulfs of several sorts.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="18"> Because Coleridge's interests and achievements were so broad, "Coleridgeans" easily divide into hostile camps: the literary theorists, the critics, the epistemologists, the theologians, the political theorists.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="19"> Coleridge's personal life also invites sharply divided opinion: Lies, debts, drugs, plagiarism must be balanced against wit, generosity, genius and suffering.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="20"> Given this situation, intelligent moderation can be a daring act -- and one that also requires considerable scholarship.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="21"> I came away warmly impressed both with Holmes' personal integrity and with his scholarly judgment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="22"> Holmes' balanced yet sympathetic portrait rests upon a consistent narrative unity.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="23"> He does not use biography as an excuse to string together analyses of major works.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="24"> Nor is he trying to psychoanalyze Coleridge.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="25"> I particularly admired the balance and insight of his accounts of Coleridge's early experiences because the primary documentary evidence often is so contradictory.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="26"> For instance, all his life Coleridge elicited extravagant praise; in particular, he made an incredible first impression on others.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="27"> Too often, this exaggerated praise collapsed into an equally exaggerated censure.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="28"> Coleridge's discerning empathy, his verbal wit, his capacity for self-parody and, above all, his prodigious intelligence ought to have impressed anyone.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="29"> Yet Coleridge was always eager for approval; he was centrally, agonizingly insecure -- a pair of problems that he himself linked to the early death of his fond, approving father and to his mother's remarkable coldness.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="30"> Having elicited the attention and approval he needed, Coleridge then had to cope with meeting expectations that would have intimidated far more confident men.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="31"> Holmes maps out this pattern in well-documented detail but never uses depth psychology to explain it away.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="32"> Instead, he uses the pattern to generate a lively dramatic tension: How talented is this chap anyhow?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="33"> Will he make anything of himself?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="34"> And if so, what?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="35"> Is he going to make it as a poet?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="36"> Or should he stick with the political journalism that has been so well-received?</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="37"> And is this German stuff yet another escape, or will it lead to something?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="38"> The only personal or dramatic balance that Holmes misses, it seems to me, concerns Coleridge's opium use.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="39"> Although duly noting Coleridge's arthritis and his recurrent bouts with rheumatic fever (in which severe joint pain is the most prominent symptom), Holmes at first seems to dismiss Coleridge's subsequent malaise in damp winter weather as some version of Seasonal Affective Disorder.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="40"> Holmes does not point out that Coleridge's pattern of opium use more nearly matches that found in people who take narcotics for legitimate reasons: When his symptoms subsided with warmer and dryer weather, he could decrease his dose with far fewer consequences than true addicts experience.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="41"> Especially when rheumatic valve damage turned to congestive heart failure, Coleridge's mix of physical and psychological motives for taking opium became extraordinarily complex: the use of the word addict oversimplifies.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="42"> Holmes does not explore these motives with the subtlety that I admire at other points in this book.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="43"> Yet Holmes is bold and discerning in his portrait of Coleridge's work, including the plagiarism problem.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="44"> In the disappointments of 1799, Holmes can "glimpse something new stirring in that extraordinarily flexible and resourceful mind: the hope of creating himself imaginatively out of the sense of failure itself".</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="45"> He contends that, for Coleridge, "the subject of failure, of lost imaginative power, could itself produce great poetry, vividly imagined and metaphysically argued".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="46"> This very central argument probably will have a parallel in the next volume of this two-volume biography: that the failure of Coleridge's formal philosophic ambitions itself produced a philosophic theology and a literary criticism of extraordinary power and influence.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="47"> Holmes' argument about Coleridge's significance is radical because Coleridge has been damned for his "inability" to propose an old-fashioned, closed, strictly logical philosophical system.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="48"> Or, just as obtusely, Coleridge's philosophic and theological work has been written off as a disaster that smothered a fine poet.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="49"> Holmes adeptly transcends these usual categories.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="50"> Holmes' work thus complements the massive re-evaluation that has slowly been built upon new or modern editions of Coleridge's writings -- especially the "Notebooks".</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="51"> This biography promises to integrate Coleridge's career as nothing else ever has, and thus to provide one basis for interrelating Coleridge's work in diverse disciplines.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="52"> "Coleridge: Early Visions" will prove widely influential because Holmes' portrait is so accurate, so fully imagined, so wonderfully engaging in its own right.</s>

<s docid="LA060390-0140" num="53"> I'm ordering copies of this volume as gifts for friends who have heard me tell Coleridge stories for 20 years.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="7">. .(18) Metro It is an interesting title: Batman Returns.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="8"> Does it refer to the caped crusader's comeback or the series' box-office revenue to date?</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="9"> The returns from Batman 1, as we know, were roughly equivalent to the gross national product of Phrygia under King Midas.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="10"> Now here comes Batman 2, which in two weeks in America has notched up Dollars 100m, enough to make Midas sell his kingdom for shares in Warner Brothers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="11"> What can it mean? I am leasing space briefly in this column to two authorities who may shed light.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="12"> First, my six-year-old nephew.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="13"> 'Well, in the film, Batman fights the Penguin who is very nasty and wants to have the power over Gotham City, 'cos Penguin is this big, fat thing who squawks and has these penguin soldiers with rockets and, and, and, Catwoman, who was the bad millionaire's secretary but now has been made into a cat by falling out of a window and then cats breathe in her face and she helps Batman and fights him'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="14"> All clear so far?</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="15"> Let us proceed to my second authority, a sociologist-structuralist friend.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="16"> He prefers not to be quoted direct but maintains that Batman is a symbolic alter ego for developed Western civilisation today.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="17"> Batman/Bruce Wayne acts out our own identity crisis as we make amends for our guilty affluence, amassed over the century, with guerrilla deeds of heroism (like Iraq) or fly-by-night flourishes of socio-ecological conscience (like the Rio summit).</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="18"> Possibly. What I saw and heard in Batman Returns was two hours of noisy, lurid pyrotechnics.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="19"> Experiencing the soundtrack, all bangs, shrieks and maniacally repeated signature tunes, is like being lost in an exploding American theme park: Anaheim agonistes or Orlando furioso.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="20"> The sets, plundering everything from Citizen Kane to Socialist Realism, pile design plagiarisms on the late Anton Furst's haunting original.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="21"> (Furst won an Oscar for Batman and then died after throwing himself from an eighth floor window, in bizarre premonition of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman).</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="22"> And the actors, Miss P apart, either offer languid read-throughs of underdeveloped roles (Michael Keaton's Batman, Christopher Walken as demon millionaire Max Shreck) or scream and gesticulate as if someone has set fire to their trousers (Danny De Vito's Penguin).</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="23"> As for the script, co-written by Daniel Waters with director Tim Burton who fashioned Batman 1 and the gentle Edward Scissorhands, it seems aimed at two main social groups.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="24"> One is sub-literate morons who can recognize a pun only when it swats them firmly in the face.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="25"> ('Just the pussy I was looking for]' cackles Penguin on first sighting Catwoman).</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="26"> The second is people with cloth ears who need a joke repeated in case they missed it the first time.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="27"> Thus Miss Pfeiffer's pre-feline spinster secretary, tripping into her lonely flat, says 'Honey, I'm home - oh, I forgot, I'm not married'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="28"> We laugh.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="29"> Then 20 minutes later she says it again.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="30"> The cloth-ears laugh.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="31"> Pfeiffer, it happens, is the treat of the film.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="32"> She begins as a female Clark Kent, all spectacles, gaucherie and tangled ankles.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="33"> Then, metamorphosed into Catwoman, she purrs and miaows with leather-clad panache.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="34"> Not since Diana Rigg in The Avengers have so many large animals lost their skins to so great sartorial-erotic effect.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="35"> muddle-headedness that Pfeiffer is given no clear role in either the romance or the action.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="36"> She sets Batman and Penguin each a-tremble, but by climax time she has been sidelined by both.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="37"> The story's last-act spotlight, jiggling away in the glory of Batvision and Bat-erama, shines down fulsomely, exclusively on hero and villain.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="38"> What a shame they are both so dull.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="39"> Keaton the actor has vanished forever into his designer-muscled Batsuit.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="40"> And De Vito's Penguin suggests a Jimmy Durante impersonator trying to shout himelf silly from a mountain-top.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="41"> Will there be a Batman 3?</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="42"> Buy earplugs and other necessary protective devices while stocks last.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="43"> * * * The Butcher's Wife is a comedy so sotto voce, by contrast, that you should borrow your great aunt Norma's ear trumpet.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="44"> Scripted for gentle whimsy by Ezra Litwak and Marjorie Schwartz, it plants North Carolina psychic Demi Moore in New York where she falls out of love with her butcher husband George Dzunza and in love with psychiatrist Jeff Daniels.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="45"> Throwing her clairvoyant powers around like confetti, she also changes the lives of spinster, and Frances McDormand, literate lesbian.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="46"> Has Demi Moore, wan of voice and manner, been on a charisma reduction course?</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="47"> Here she vanishes into the recycled Greenwich Village wallpaper, more Hemi-demi-semi Moore, while Daniels and the minor characters come forth with the charm.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="48"> The mad offhand grace-notes are best: like the actions in one scene of a patient in Daniels' office when no one except us is looking.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="49"> (I shall reveal no more: giggle yourself).</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="50"> Britain's Terry Hughes directed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="51"> How I wish that some pairs of unrelated films could be introduced to each other, like boxers touching gloves before Round One, and then set scrapping with no holds barred.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="52"> Joan Micklin Silver's Stepkids, an icky tale of family bonding, would be greatly improved by the attentions of Clovis the Attack Cat from Stephen King's Sleepwalkers, directed by Mick Garris.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="53"> Clovis is a police cat with a mission: to tear apart over-bonded families like Alice Krige and Brian Krause, an incestuous, vampiric mother-son duo who settle in a small Southern town where he brings home date-rape victims for her to eat.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="54"> Meanwhile large numbers of famous horror writers and directors pop up through the cracks in the plot doing cameos: John Landis, Joe Dante, Clive Barker, King himself.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="55"> They distract us from the gathering daftness, but not enough.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="56"> The film's blood count is high and fine, its special effects likewise.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="57"> But plot logic is savaged early on - why do Krige-Krause stay in a town with such an active police force, why do cats gather in unexplained dozens outside their window? - and never fully recovers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="58"> Stepkids is a moral fable set in America's Laocoon age of serial polygamy and multiple half-siblings.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="59"> When young Laura (Hillary Woolf) runs away from a lakeside visit to her stepbrother, a platoon of parents, step-parents and semi-brothers and sisters descend to search for her and sort out their own lives.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="60"> It is a comedy of extended families by a director not extended at all: Joan Micklin once made, though you would not think it, Hester Street and Between The Lines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="61"> Frank Mugavero wrote the homiletic script, Griffin Dunne, Margaret Whitton, Adrienne Shelley and ohers try to bring it to life.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="62"> I have one more job for Clovis the Attack Cat.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="63"> After his visit to Lake Homily, he should go to Madrid to sort out problem elements in the city's post-liberation subculture.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="64"> Pepi, Luci, Bom ..</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="65"> is an early Pedro Almodovar comedy - how many more are still to come? - featuring drugs, sex, violence, urination and the other things not possible under Franco.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="66"> It also features a plot of sorts, but we cannot expect you to find that when even critics with helpful Press handouts are powerless to do so.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="67"> In short, a shambles.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="68"> Clovis's mission is to track down any further early Almodovar films and shred them on sight.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="69"> * * * Why not repair to the 16th Cambridge Film Festival?</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="70"> The fens are alive with the sound of international movies receiving their British premieres.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="71"> From America, the animated feature Ferngully, Jim Jarmusch's latest mood-piece Night On Earth and Tim Robbins's Cannes-acclaimed political satire Bob Roberts.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14204" num="72"> From Europe and points East, films by Chabrol, Zanussi, Istvan Szabo, Agnieszka Holland</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="6"> OF ALL diseases, none has a more fearsome reputation than rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="7"> For reasons no one can explain, it died out in Europe during the later part of the 19th and first half of the 20th century.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="8"> In 1939, though, there was an ominous outbreak close to the Polish-German frontier.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="9"> Since then - spread mainly by red foxes - the virus has travelled inexorably west across Europe at a rate of about 40 kilometres a year.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="10"> Rabies was eradicated from Britain by 1903, but with fox-borne rabies now only just across the English Channel, some scientists are convinced that it will soon be back.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="11"> In 1986, James Murray, professor of mathematical biology at Oxford University, published a computer model warning that rabies will return to Britain - and will spread rapidly.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="12"> Prof Murray points to the rarity of deaths from rabies in Britain, where it seems never to have reached epidemic proportions.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="13"> In Murray's view, however, the Channel Tunnel will be an irrelevance as far as the spread of rabies is concerned.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="14"> English sentimentality about animals and the vast number of pleasure craft crossing the Channel make it inevitable that one day a pet animal will come ashore somewhere - and reintroduce the virus.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="15"> When that happens, the British, like their neighbours and most of the rest of the world, will need to become accustomed to viewing parks, woods and fields as the haunt of a lurking killer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="16"> In the early 5th century, St Augustine of Hippo compiled a daunting list of the disasters that may at any moment fall on our defenceless heads: insanity, bankruptcy, imprisonment, torture, fire, stroke.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="17"> Among them he included rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="18"> Fifteen centuries later, does rabies really deserve its horrifying image?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="19"> After all, rabies vaccine is available both as a prophylactic and for treating those who have been in contact with an infected animal.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="20"> Vaccinated bait is widely and expensively used in programmes intented to control the spread of the disease among wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="21"> Yet the horrors of rabies can hardly be less fundamental today than when it stalked the cities of Roman North Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="22"> There is still no known cure.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="23"> Once clinical symptoms appear - fever, headache and 'a sense of apprehension' - its victims are doomed to a horrible death.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="24"> Both in France and in England, it used to be common practice to suffocate victims under mattresses.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="25"> Read any description of the effect of rabies and one sees the case for euthanasia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="26"> In its most common form, furious rabies, sufferers develop hydrophobia - a dread of water - which has been described by Prof David Warrell, an expert in tropical medicine, as 'the most terrible and mysterious symptom in the whole of medicine'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="27"> Rabies, says Warrell, 'remains the most. . . hopeless of human infections'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="28"> In short, there is little room for late 20th-century complacency.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="29"> All the more reason, then, to look with interest, if bemusement, at an extraordinary healing cult that flourished in a small village in north-west Europe for nine centuries.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="30"> Fear does strange things to people and so does hope.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="31"> Those two emotions, working powerfully together, with a dash of the profit motive thrown in, played a large role in the extraordinary and little-known history of St Hubert of the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="32"> St Hubert was an early 8th-century bishop of Liege who preached Christianity in the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="33"> A century after his death, monks carried his holy (and still incorrupt - ie, not mouldy) corpse from its grave in a church in Liege to an impoverished monastery high in the forest of the Ardennes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="34"> The abbot and his monks badly needed a miracle-working relic to boost morale and attract pilgrims, and St Hubert conveniently started to perform healing miracles in his tomb.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="35"> After miraculous cures, many grateful pilgrims settled nearby, some of them with useful trades to ply, such as blacksmith.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="36"> And so, thanks to a saint's holy bones, a village sprang up.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="37"> Today Saint-Hubert-les-Ardennes is a charming, slate-roofed town modestly famous as the birthplace of the flower-painter Redoubte - and for the fetes de Saint-Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="38"> St Hubert is still known and loved throughout catholic northern Europe as the patron saint of hunters.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="39"> The tourist office, housed in the former mansion of the mighty abbots of Saint-Hubert, dispenses leaflets telling the picturesque legend of the saint's conversion.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="40"> Sadly - but not untypically - the legend has nothing to do with the real St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="41"> It is a barefaced example of monastic plagiarism, lifted from the Life of St Eustace.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="42"> The story goes that Hubert, a young nobleman, went hunting on Good Friday and was confronted by a white stag with a crucifix between its antlers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="43"> Christ reproached Hubert, whereupon he decided to enter the Church.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="44"> On September 25 and November 3, mass is celebrated in honour of St Hubert in the town's magnificent gothic church, punctuated by huntsmen blowing fanfares.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="45"> Tourists turn up for the fete in September, which is modestly promoted by the Belgian tourist office as a hunting festival: St Hubert still has a role to play in bringing revenue to his town.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="46"> In November, the atmosphere is more obviously spiritual.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="47"> Local people bring dogs and even horses to be blessed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="48"> In all this ceremony, there is nothing to remind visitors that the key to St Hubert's centuries of fame was his reputation as the saint who could prevent -and cure - rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="49"> As early as the 11th century, a monk wrote that it was standard practice for people bitten by rabid dogs and wolves to visit the shrine.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="50"> What happened there was very odd indeed and quite without parallel in the history of medieval shrines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="51"> A priest would make a cut in the pilgrim's forehead and push in a thread pulled from the saint's episcopal stole.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="52"> Later, the monks claimed that this stole had been woven in Heaven by the Virgin Mary and flown down to the saint by an angelic messenger.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="53"> As for the origin of the ritual, known as la taille, it is surely an instance of sympathetic magic.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="54"> In antiquity, rabies was one of many diseases blamed on worms - relatives of the poet William Blake's 'invisible worm that flies in the night'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="55"> Worms, under a dog's tongue or in its anus, were thought to cause rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="56"> It could well be that someone decided that because a white thread resembles a worm, it might expel the diabolic sickness of rabies if placed inside the head, close to the soul.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="57"> With the saint literally under their skin, people would not only be 'inoculated' against the risk of rabies: it was claimed they could be cured of the disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="58"> The disappearance of St Hubert's holy relics when Huguenots sacked the abbey was - and is - keenly felt.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="59"> However, the holy stole was safe, so the pilgrimage was unaffected.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="60"> Moreover, it was said that the holy stole never became any shorter.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="61"> Whether or not that is true, today it is a length of silk 105cm by 42mm of 11th- or 12th-century workmanship.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="62"> Normally, it can be seen in a reliquary on one of the altars.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="63"> However, on November 3, after mass, when the church has almost emptied, a priest holds it to the heads of the more devout.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="64"> In the 17th century, doctors of Paris University attacked the credibility of the stole and were furiously rebutted by supporters of this enormously popular pilgrimage.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="65"> Proof of its appeal is the sheer size of the church, its marble floor and magnificently carved stalls.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="66"> Records, kept at the shrine from 1653, were continued even after the abbey was secularised in the French revolution.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="67"> Early in the 18th century, a monk had noted that in four years, 1,956 people had been given la taille.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="68"> Between 1806 and 1834, some 4,800 were still seeking out St Hubert's healing power.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="69"> La taille still had its devotees in the 1920s.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="70"> It was said to be common for people fearful of contracting rabies to go to the Pasteur Instititue in Paris for inoculation, and - just to make sure - visit St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="71"> What, we may ask, was going on?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="72"> How could people have been deluded for so long into thinking that a visit to this saint's shrine had power over this most terrible of diseases?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="73"> On the face of it, the pilgrimage must seem like a mockery, a tragic waste of effort and expense.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="74"> The only justification would seem to be that during an agonising period of uncertainty, as sufferers and families waited to see if the dread symptoms appeared, the pilgrimage offered solace.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="75"> But there are more things to be said in explanation of the long 'success' of the pilgrimage to St Hubert.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="76"> Many of the pilgrims must simply have made a mistake.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="77"> They thought they had been bitten by a mad beast, but it ran off so they had no proof.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="78"> Only pilgrims brought to the abbey from homes within a few days' journey could possibly have had furious rabies, since death occurs swiftly.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="79"> Many raging, barking, convulsing wretches who were tied to an iron ring by St Hubert's altar to await la taille must have been malades imaginaires.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="80"> They were suffering from rabies hysteria, a strange phenomenon which has been well documented in countries where rabies is prevalent.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="81"> Deluded sufferers are said to exhibit a terrifying range of symptoms associated with furious rabies.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="82"> Doctors today suspect that they are dealing with this bizarre phenomenon whenever the symptoms follow hard on the heels of an animal bite.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="83"> One of the horrible features of rabies is that the virus commonly lies dormant for between 12 and 60 days.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="84"> The hysteric gives the game away by claiming he or she has been bitten only hours or a day or so earlier.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="85"> At the shrine, many an hysteric was no doubt swiftly 'cured' the instant they received the supernatural thread.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="86"> Conversely, and tragically, there were people who made the journey on foot, horse, or latterly by train, received la taille and, once they got home, faithfully kept the novena, the nine days of ritual observance.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="87"> It appeared they were cured, for the virus can take two years to become active.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="88"> In the end, they succumbed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="89"> Did anyone then think to inform the priest at Saint-Hubert, let alone accuse St Hubert of impotence?</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="90"> The 'fail-safe' principle that explained the success of so many healing cults was not that Christianity taught that God's power, and that of his saints, worked automatically; on the contrary, God's power was an abyss which the mind of man could not plumb.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="91"> The silk stole of a saint was like a ladder over the abyss.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="92"> Many would cross in safety thanks to the power of their faith and the prayers of their loved ones.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="93"> But some would perish.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="94"> Even here, though, faith held out comfort to the bereaved - the thought that all those hours of racking agony would surely incline God to mercy at the hour of judgment.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="95"> Today, rabies is at large once more in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5564" num="96"> But there is no sign, so far, of a return of the cast of mind which, for nine centuries, gave St Hubert's stole its power .</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="9"> Erik Menendez, accused along with his older brother, Lyle, in the shotgun murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion, is returning to Los Angeles to give himself up to police, an attorney for his brother said Friday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="10"> "It's my understanding that he wants to turn himself in as soon as possible," said defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, who is representing Lyle, 22.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="11"> Erik, 19, had been in Israel playing in a professional tennis tournament, and was reported to have flown to London before transferring to a Los Angeles flight.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="12"> Lyle was arrested by Beverly Hills detectives Thursday and booked on suspicion of homicide.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="13"> Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is expected to announce Monday that both brothers will be charged with homicide under "special circumstances," which would mean that the pair could receive the death penalty if convicted.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="14"> "I would expect special circumstances because of the grotesqueness of the crime," said the chief of detectives of the Beverly Hills Police Department, Lt.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="15"> Russ Olson.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="16"> The suspects' father, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were slain in a barrage of shotgun blasts at close range while they watched television in the first-floor library of their Elm Drive home last Aug. 20.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="17"> As police and prosecutors busied themselves Friday preparing for a Monday arraignment hearing, there were these other developments:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="18"> It was learned that police have obtained a 12-gauge shotgun shell casing that was found by a friend in one of Lyle's jackets.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="19"> His parents were murdered with two 12-gauge shotguns, law enforcement sources have said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="20"> Asked whether he considered the shell casing important evidence, Olson said, "I think it will be".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="21"> Although the killers -- police said there were two -- picked up the shell casings before leaving the house on the night of the murders, investigators later found shotgun wadding -- material expended with the shells -- at the scene.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="22"> At a minimum, sources said, the casing in police custody could be used as circumstantial evidence that Lyle had some familiarity with guns.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="23"> It was not immediately clear whether the wadding matches the single shell that was recovered.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="24"> Also, tape recordings between a psychologist and the two brothers, made after the murders, have been seized by Beverly Hills detectives and, if admitted into evidence, could bolster the prosecution's case, sources said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="25"> Police served search warrants Thursday on the psychologist's office and home.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="26"> The tapes that were seized are now being stored pending a court hearing on the admissibility of the evidence.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="27"> There are believed to be several tapes, although Olson declined to say what was on them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="28"> Before the seizure of the tapes from the psychologist, police had been trying to poke holes in the alibi of the two sons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="29"> The brothers said they had attended the movie "Batman" on the night of the murder and then had gone to a food festival at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="30"> Finally, they said they had made plans to meet a friend at a Beverly Hills restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="31"> Sources said police found some inconsistencies in the alibi, but not enough to be critically damaging to their defense.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="32"> Police also were interested in the sons' behavior after the murders.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="33"> Friends said Lyle went on a spending spree that included the purchase of a new Porsche, residential property in Princeton, N.J., and, most recently, a Princeton restaurant that specialized in chicken wings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="34"> Erik dropped plans to enter UCLA after the murders and launched a professional tennis career.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="35"> Both brothers traveled extensively, often on the exclusive MGM Grand airline, according to sources.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="36"> Police said they had been developing a considerable amount of circumstantial evidence but that only recently did they find "the glue" that enabled them to move against the brothers.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="37"> "The things that came from the psychologist are quite helpful," said Olson.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="38"> "But it (the case) was there without it".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="39"> Conversations between a patient and a psychologist are considered confidential except in some unusual circumstances.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="40"> One is in the case of a person who tells his therapist he intends to physically harm someone.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="41"> Then the therapist has a duty to report it.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="42"> Another exception is when a person tries to enlist the therapist to help him elude prosecution.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="43"> Sources declined to say under which exception authorities are hoping to use the tape recordings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="44"> Some investigators have said greed could be a motive.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="45"> They pointed out that the two sons were the sole heirs to the $14-million Menendez estate.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="46"> But others who saw the gruesome pictures of the victims said rage must also have been involved.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="47"> Lyle had been under surveillance in recent days.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="48"> In the last week, as police moved closer to an arrest, they traveled to Princeton and visited one of Lyle's recent acquisitions -- a restaurant called Chuck's Spring Street Cafe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="49"> The Menendez family lived in the Princeton area until 1986, when they moved to California.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="50"> Both brothers attended prep school there and Lyle went to Princeton University before he dropped out in 1988, reportedly because of a plagiarism scandal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="51"> "They (detectives) were very nice.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="52"> They made a comment that the (chicken) wings could be hotter," said Gus Tangalos, the restaurant manager.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="53"> "They introduced themselves as friends of Lyle Menendez.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="54"> They were looking for him".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="55"> A friend of Lyle, David Pae Bros, said the detectives "questioned all of Lyle's friends on campus.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="56"> The friends have been shaken up".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="57"> After the detectives left, Bros said, Lyle complained that the police were harassing him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="58"> "He did not want to speak with the police at all," Bros said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="59"> Bros added that Lyle had been questioned several times by police and it was bothering him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="60"> "They (police) constantly followed him around," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="61"> Bros said Lyle had a girlfriend in Princeton who was "in shock" over the arrest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="62"> He also said Lyle went back to California recently to set up a corporation, Menendez Investment Enterprises, which was designed to be a shell for real estate ventures.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="63"> News of the arrest Thursday was big news in the affluent university town.</s>

<s docid="LA031090-0056" num="64"> It was the main story of the Daily Princetonian, the undergraduate newspaper, and the restaurant owned by Lyle was filled for lunch.</s>

<s docid="LA052189-0192" num="7"> I rise in defense of private, copyright property: for the "text" of Gerald Locklin's "Homage to John Cage" is identical with that of my poem, "The Lazy Man Says Hello to God" (Christopher's Books).</s>

<s docid="LA052189-0192" num="11"> Unlike Locklin's heavy-handed art object, however, mine was a bona fide expression of its fictive protagonist's ruling passion (laziness), which later in the "narrative" would prove itself in a haiku only 4-5-3 syllables long.</s>

<TEXT>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="9"> Of course it matters that Martin Luther King Jr. appears to have plagiarized important sections of his doctoral dissertation.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="10"> It won't change (though it may be used to justify) the opinions of those who never thought him worthy of adulation.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="11"> It won't make him less of a hero (though it will certainly render him more human) to his legions of admirers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="12"> But it matters -- matters a great deal -- and those who say otherwise may be yielding to wishful thinking.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="13"> As a certified King admirer, I was among those whose first reaction to the revelation of his probable academic cheating was to insist that it was no big deal.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="14"> My admiration, I told myself, was based not on his scholarship: It was based on his leadership of perhaps the most important social movement in the history of this country, on the eloquence of his words and actions that moved America to rethink its racial attitudes, change its laws and refocus its fundamental dream.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="15"> King's most important contribution, I reminded myself, was his gift of courage: the courage to resist -- and to inspire countless others to resist -- the Jim Crow laws that had seemed a permanent way of life in the Deep South; the courage to stand up (or to go limp in passive resistance) against threats of jail, economic reprisal and physical harm; the courage to look his own impending death in the eye and still go forward with his campaign for racial justice.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="16"> I still admire him for that.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="17"> But I also admired King the scholar, a man to whom philosophical ideas and political action seemed inseparable, who was as willing to borrow the seminal ideas of the great theologians as to appropriate the nonviolent techniques of a Gandhi.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="18"> I treasured his courage, but I also treasured the ideas that lay behind the courage and the words that gave it force.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="19"> I have used his example to impress on young people the value of scholarship and to tell them (and myself) that intellectual integrity is no less valuable than physical courage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="20"> So it cannot be inconsequential that his scholarship and his intellectual integrity are now called into question.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="21"> In one area, at least, my hero has let me down, and it makes me sad.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="22"> It isn't that I had thought King perfect, or that I joined those who willfully overlooked his shortcomings -- or who contended that anyone else should.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="23"> His storied fondness for women and his marital cheating did not, for me, detract from either his courage or his moral leadership on the racial front.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="24"> (My objection to the "womanizing" revelations of his friend and picked successor, the late Ralph David Abernathy, was not that I thought King's human weaknesses should be concealed but that they should not be exploited by someone King had let so completely inside and so completely trusted).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="25"> The newest revelations are different, because they call into question not King's weaknesses but his strengths.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="26"> Claybourne Carson, the Stanford University researcher picked by King's widow to head the Martin Luther King Jr.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="27"> Papers Project, and a committed admirer of King, has been forced to acknowledge that "several" of the martyr's papers, as well as his dissertation, "contain numerous appropriated passages that can be defined as plagiarism".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="28"> It's a bitter fact that the revelation comes just after the defeat of an Arizona bill to make King's birthday an official holiday.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="29"> It will be used as evidence that the Arizona voters were right.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="30"> They weren't.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="31"> The importance of the proposed bill was that it honored America's foremost black leader.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="32"> It was not based on King's reputation as a scholar, but on the undeniable fact of his leadership.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="33"> And those who voted against it would not have voted differently if Claybourne Carson's scholars had disclosed that the theologian Paul Tillich had stolen from King's work, rather than the other way around.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="34"> Evidence after the fact does not alter the racism implicit in what happened in Arizona.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="35"> But I cannot say it doesn't matter.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="36"> King the scholar has been diminished, even if King the leader stands as tall as ever.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="37"> I suppose we can draw lessons from the revelations -- just as we draw lessons from the discovery that other people we admire turn out to have their feet of clay.</s>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="38"> We need to understand that our heroes are, after all, human beings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111590-0009" num="39"> But that doesn't alter my sadness that for now, and in one area of his still-astounding career, my hero let me down.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="7"> THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's board room, which is a quarter of the size of a football pitch, was an appropriate venue for Mr Jacques Attali's farewell.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="8"> The onslaught of criticism faced by Mr Attali in the past three months began on April 13, when the Financial Times disclosed that the bank had spent Pounds 200m on itself in its first two years, including Pounds 55.5m fitting out its City of London headquarters.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="9"> Of this sum, several millions had been spent on the boardroom, including its oval designer desk, sophisticated translation facilities and trompe l'oeil book case.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="10"> At 10.30am yesterday, Mr Attali entered the boardroom and told the bank's 23 directors, who represent the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank, that he had decided to resign.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="11"> 'The attacks have been growing day by day,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="12"> 'It is better for the institution that I take this decision'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="13"> Most of the directors received the news in silence.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="14"> Many were relieved, concerned at the tide of bad publicity and convinced that new management is required.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="15"> But of the three who did speak out, all offered praise.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="16"> 'Thank you for what you have done for the bank,' Mr Guiseppe Maresca, the Italian director, told the meeting.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="17"> 'This board will take care of your baby'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="18"> Mr Maresca was paraphrasing Mr Attali, who at the annual meeting at the end of April had referred to the bank as his 'baby'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="19"> It was partly as a result of his initiative that the EBRD had been set up in April 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="20"> His original vision was that the EBRD should be a publicly- owned institution which assessed its investments as rigorously as a blue chip investment bank, while being explicitly motivated by the political goal of promoting democracy and free markets in the fledgling private sector of the former Soviet bloc.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="21"> It was a vision unique and complex as the man himself.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="22"> Mr Attali had never worked as a banker, although he wrote a biography of Sir Siegmund Warburg, the founder of SG Warburg.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="23"> But he chose to ignore one of his subject's main strictures, that banks should never spend lavishly on their offices.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="24"> At the age of 49, friends say he still thinks of himself as an anti-establishment figure, having been born into an Algerian Jewish family.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="25"> However, he was educated at France's elite National School of Public Administration, his brother, Bernard, is chairman of Air France, and he spent most of the 1980s as the special adviser to the French president, Mr Francois Mitterrand.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="26"> His intellectual and physical appetite is legendary.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="27"> He has published 16 books and starts work before dawn each day, although this has not prevented him becoming an habitue of London nightspots.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="28"> But perhaps his most salient characteristic is his capacity to arouse passions in others.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="29"> 'People either love him or hate him,' said a close colleague.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="30"> 'You won't find many who are indifferent'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="31"> To some, he is Renaissance man, to others a dilettante.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="32"> There is evidence for both views.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="33"> On the one hand, he has probably been the west's most articulate analyst of the problems faced by the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="34"> On the other, he has been accused - though he vehemently denies it - of plagiarism in his new 960 page book, Verbatim, which records Mr Mitterrand's life at the Elysee Palace from 1981 to 1986.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="35"> Perhaps inevitably, the EBRD's staff has been split between those, mostly francophones, close to Mr Attali, and a group which felt itself outside the charmed circle.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="36"> 'There was a bank within a bank,' said one executive.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="37"> 'In terms of who wielded power, titles were less important than being a friend of Mr Attali'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="38"> This inner group included Mr Pierre Pissaloux, who originally held the roles of both cabinet director and budget director, but who has since relinquished his budget role, Mr Francois Olive, Mr Attali's personal assistant, Mr Guy de Sellier, the deputy head of merchant banking and Mr Andre Newburg, the general counsel.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="39"> Like many French statesmen, notably Mr Mitterrand, Mr Attali believes that public buildings should be monuments.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="40"> It would have been unthinkable for him to scrimp on the bank's headquarters.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="41"> But the bank's US, UK and Australian employees and directors judged the building's fitting out costs extravagant, notably the decision to replace one type of brand new marble with another at a cost of more than Pounds 750,000.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="42"> They were also angry at Mr Attali's use of private jets.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="43"> In 1992, the bank paid Pounds 739,000 for him to make 26 journeys by private aircraft supplied by a Paris-based charterer, Air Entreprise.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="44"> Some of the destinations were well served by scheduled flights.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="45"> The bank's audit committee is now investigating whether proper procedures were followed on the building and why Mr Attali used the private flights, as well as examining other allegations of extravagance and loose financial controls.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="46"> A deadline of July 15 has been set for the report to go to the EBRD's board.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="47"> However, the board's preoccupation in the past few weeks has been whether the bank should change its philosophy of concentrating on making investments in the private sector to devote more resources to developing the infrastructure of eastern Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="48"> This issue had become confused with the question of who should manage the bank, since Mr Attali had presented a management reorganisation proposal whose effect would have been to concentrate more resources on development banking, or investing in infrastructure.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="49"> Level-headed debate within the bank on this issue became difficult, since Mr Attali's plan was viewed by some as an attempt to reinforce his own position.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="50"> 'We were discussing personalities, rather than the issues,' said a director.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="51"> The reorganisation also had the effect of demoting Mr Ron Freeman, the first vice president and head of merchant banking, from number two to number four in the bank.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="52"> This plan, which is still under consideration by the board, would have involved the appointment of Mr Ernest Stern, currently number two at the World Bank, to the new post of EBRD chief operating officer and the promotion of Mr Mario Sarcinelli, currently in charge of development banking at the EBRD, to take charge of the budget and personnel.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="53"> The result was open warfare between Mr Attali's supporters and his opponents.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="54"> Mr Freeman, having in April written an article in the FT defending the EBRD's expenditure on refurbishing its offices, felt betrayed.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="55"> 'Morale here is terrible,' said one executive yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="56"> 'The personnel department has been inundated with resignation notices'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="57"> The final external blow was a story in yesterday's FT that Mr Attali had double-billed his expenses on a trip to Tokyo.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="58"> Mr Attali wrote in his resignation letter that he knew of 'no action that..</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="59"> in any way could be worthy of reproach,' but he felt he had to go.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="60"> The obituaries, like the earlier reviews, will contain wildly varying views.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="61"> As one senior east European diplomat put it yesterday: 'He had the vision.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="62"> But he was, well, just a bit arrogant with us.</s>

<s docid="FT932-890" num="63"> I hope his successor is as committed to integrating the two Europes.'</s>

<TEXT>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="9"> He was brash, controversial.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="10"> As a writer he liked to incite anger -- to "twist the knife," as he put it, in vitriolic free-lance columns for the National Review attacking feminists, gays and other targets.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="11"> And increasingly, Stuart Goldman gravitated to investigative journalism; he went undercover to research widely seen exposes of a TV evangelist and, later, an alleged UFO cult.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="12"> Early last year, Goldman, with typical zeal, undertook what he claimed was a long-range, undercover expose of the gossip media -- the tabloid newspapers and TV shows that feed with shark-like frenzy on Los Angeles' vast entertainment community.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="13"> It was a project, Goldman said, that drew him into the seamy underside of journalism, a world tainted with greed, spying and payoffs to sources.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="14"> For months, he claims, he gathered material while free-lancing for the Enquirer, Fox Television's "A Current Affair," the Globe, the Star, Paramount's "Hard Copy" and other organizations.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="15"> Ultimately, however, Goldman got burned.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="16"> On March 8, the 45-year-old writer was arrested at his Studio City apartment by Secret Service agents and Los Angeles police who confiscated a personal computer, floppy disks, Rolodexes and a loaded.38-caliber handgun .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="17"> Goldman now faces seven felony charges for allegedly entering Fox Television computers by telephone and stealing story ideas.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="18"> One of those ideas, according to court records, was a fictitious tip involving "Ronald Reagan Jr.'s Lover," planted by investigators as bait.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="19"> Prosecutors say Goldman tried to sell the bogus tip to the Globe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="20"> The case not only raises computer-age issues of privacy, idea ownership and journalistic ethics; it is a saga befitting the tabloids, a battle of the influential network versus the self-proclaimed muckraker.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="21"> Free from jail and awaiting an Oct. 1 preliminary hearing, Goldman denies the charge of trying to sell stolen information.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="22"> His attorney, Joseph Yanny, claims Goldman was given authority to use the Fox computer while working as a free-lancer -- authority that was never revoked.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="23"> "The evidence will show that this was one very elaborate setup intended to get Stuart Goldman," Yanny said.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="24"> "It was decided to get Stuart Goldman and to make an example of him -- not only to him from doing what he was trying to do with respect to the (expose), but also to make an example of him to other reporters out there".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="25"> Fox denies staging a setup.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="26"> Says Goldman: "These people will look very foolish when they get into court.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="27"> I'm the good guy and I'm going to prove it.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="28"> This is going to be the biggest soap opera you ever saw".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="29"> On the latter point, he may be right.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="30"> In the wake of the arrest, rumors are flying -- about telephones being wiretapped, documents disappearing.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="31"> Goldman has hired a private investigator; so has the National Enquirer, one alleged target of the expose.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="32"> CBS's "60 Minutes" has hauled in its cameras, filming a possible expose of its own.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="33"> Meanwhile, two associate producers at "A Current Affair" who were closely involved with Goldman -- one of them a key prosecution witness -- were laid off last month by Fox.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="34"> Network representatives called the move a restructuring; one insider expressed belief that the layoffs were prompted by the furor over the Goldman case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="35"> The drama, as bizarre as a purported Elvis sighting, is casting light on a journalistic world that few ever see.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="36"> The ubiquitous tabloid medium probes zealously into the private lives of celebrities, painting an impressionistic portrait for millions.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="37"> The Enquirer alone boasts a circulation of 4.3 million copies a week.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="38"> Yet the tabloids so carefully guard their own secrets that the Enquirer and other organizations will not disclose how many reporters they assign to Los Angeles, never mind how they work or what they are paid.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="39"> Goldman -- a dogged journalist with his own "rather jaded history," as he once told a TV talk show host -- sees irony in his arrest.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="40"> After so many months in which he fit in so well, so convincingly, in the tabloid world, he was led away in handcuffs with Fox cameras filming it all.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="41"> His face, flashing a mysterious half-smile, was prominently featured on the evening news.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="42"> "Did you notice the two cops (who made the arrest). . . wearing bulletproof vests"? Goldman asked indignantly, alluding to the newscast footage.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="43"> "I said, 'Did you guys really think I was that dangerous'?</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="44"> They said, 'Well, you never know what's on the other side of the door' .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="45"> "Well, then, how come they let the cameraman stand in the line of fire?</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="46"> When I looked out my peephole, I saw a camera staring at me.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="47"> If I had been nuts and had a shotgun, I would have wasted that guy"!</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="48"> Goldman had been producing a free-lance TV segment for "Inside Edition," a rival of Fox's "A Current Affair," at the time of his arrest.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="49"> Now, with that segment in limbo, he is attempting to pitch his unfinished book manuscript, "Snitch".</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="50"> The work has made him the bad boy of the tabloid press, a cynical former insider whose kiss-and-tell report is expected to create enormous embarrassment for those who once dared to hire him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="51"> "There was a personal vendetta by members of the L.A. staff of 'A Current Affair,' " Goldman said.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="52"> "Once I had started pitching the expose. . . the word was out.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="53"> They learned of this and decided they would pop me before I popped them.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="54"> And they whacked me pretty good" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="55"> In a chapter of "Snitch" given to The Times but heavily expurgated by his lawyers, Goldman breezily recounts his early days at both "A Current Affair" and the Enquirer, describing with awe the Enquirer's "gigantic network of informants".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="56"> Those informants -- paid hundreds, even many thousands of dollars for inside information about celebrities -- were a major element of his research, according to Goldman.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="57"> One such source, a man who draws blood for a living at a prominent Los Angeles hospital, leaks information to the tabloids for profit any time a celebrity checks in for surgery or to have a baby, Goldman wrote.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="58"> The man's code name is "Dracula".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="59"> "Friends, PR people, executives, bodyguards, waiters, parking lot attendants. . . all of them provided information to the Enquirer," Goldman writes.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="60"> "All the tabloids functioned by making use of snitches .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="61"> "If (a reporter) gets a tip. . . within about two minutes (the tabloids) will know somebody in some office somewhere and they'll start to get the story.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="62"> It's really incredible" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="63"> Enquirer attorney Paul Wolff, who called Goldman's disclosures about paid sources "old news," declined to discuss the research involved in the paper's stories.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="64"> "We have in the past fought tooth and nail to keep our sources confidential," Wolff said.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="65"> "We're not about to comment on them now".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="66"> The war between celebrities and the tabloid press goes back years.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="67"> Lately, however, with the advent of the so-called tabloid TV shows, the fight has escalated.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="68"> Competition for stories has grown.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="69"> One tabloid veteran, who asked for anonymity, said reporters are continually evaluated on the number of "leads," or possible stories, they find.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="70"> Critics contend that payoffs to sources induces unscrupulous informants to lie.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="71"> Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Frank Sinatra and Richard Pryor are among the increasingly outraged celebrities who have filed suit -- and won out-of-court settlements -- because of stories appearing in the tabloids.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="72"> A besieged feeling exists among many top stars.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="73"> Security consultant Gavin de Becker, whose clients include Madonna and Michael J.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="74"> Fox, said some celebrities keep their trash cans behind locked gates because reporters comb the debris for tips.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="75"> "They get (medical) prescriptions, early pregnancy tests, letters, etc".</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="76"> from the trash, De Becker said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="77"> In recent interviews, Goldman described reporting practices he observed as part of his investigation -- practices he considered unethical, at best.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="78"> Tabloids hire private detectives, for example, to run illegitimate credit checks or to obtain unlisted phone numbers, he said.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="79"> A reporter will telephone, say, the mother of a young boy who has died -- and pretend to be the priest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="80"> "And he'll get the whole story out of the woman and have her cry, you know. . . and typically the most ruthless reporter will get the story," Goldman said.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="81"> One especially effective tabloid reporter weighed nearly 400 pounds and "literally couldn't get out of bed," he added.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="82"> "But she could imitate anybody on the phone" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="83"> Wolff called such allegations "flat-out false" and said of Goldman: "I'm familiar with the fact he has told people he was somehow engaged in an undercover project.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="84"> We'll see how it plays out in the courts".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="85"> In the theory of some critics, Goldman has fabricated the "Snitch" project since his arrest to try to salvage his reputation and strike back at Fox.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="86"> Free-lance writer Rod Lurie, who spent five months researching his own story on the tabloids, due out later this monthin Los Angeles Magazine, considered the question at length.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="87"> He concluded that Goldman was, in fact, preparing an expose.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="88"> "He does have a history of gonzo journalism," Lurie observed.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="89"> "And another thing: He really was at all the tabloids.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="90"> Nobody could be fired from that many places".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="91"> Yet, Goldman's past invites doubt.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="92"> The former country-music guitarist, who once toured with Doug Kershaw, is an enigma, a do-anything, say-anything character seemingly drawn to controversy in the way old prizefighters are drawn back to the ring.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="93"> Capable of great charm, Goldman can also be abrasive, unpredictable.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="94"> Once, in 1988, he shocked his friends by distributing a fake suicide note, claiming an incurable disease and despair over a planet "ruined. . . by greedheads, liberals, feminists, homosexuals and other assorted swine.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="95"> . . . "Please believe me, this is not a joke," the letter read .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="96"> Days later, a fabricated obituary of Goldman appeared in the Los Angeles Daily News.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="97"> The prank cost him friends -- "It wasn't very smart," Goldman acknowledged -- but it symbolized a restive nature given to subterfuge, deception and the habitual use of aliases.</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="98"> Goldman describes himself as a "frustrated private detective".</s>

<s docid="LA090490-0099" num="99"> He saw the tabloids as just one more subject to investigate, one that would lend itself to the undercover approach he favored while paying him in the meantime.</s>
</P>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="7"> IN 1894 a first edition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnets came to light, having apparently languished unseen for more than 40 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="8"> As a ripple went through the literary world few realised that it was just part of a complex mystery, far exceeding - in the judgment of the writer Bernard Levin - anything conceived by Agatha Christie.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="9"> And at the centre of the plot were two eminent Victorians.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="10"> Harry Buxton Forman seemed a model of propriety.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="11"> He was in charge of Packet Services at the Post Office and an editor of Keats and Shelley.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="12"> But he was also a dedicated and skilled literary forger.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="13"> Forman did not pursue his dark craft alone.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="14"> His accomplice was Thomas James Wise, 17 years his junior, a hard-headed London commodity dealer who specialised in essential oils.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="15"> Wise was president of the Bibliographical Society and was said to have one of the finest private libraries in the country.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="16"> Together they invented a new genre: creative forgery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="17"> Book forgers usually copy great works, but Forman and Wise created books and editions after the event to fill a persuasive niche.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="18"> They were perhaps bibliographical rather than literary forgers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="19"> There are similarities with Piltdown Man: a missing link between man and monkeys is predicted and then conveniently found.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="20"> The forgers' extraordinary conspiracy is now described in a new biography by John Collins*.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="21"> For both men, and particularly for Wise, the purpose was serious: to make money.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="22"> In the heyday of Victorian capitalism Wise saw a product to corner the market.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="23"> And Forman, who wrote of his legitimate literary works: 'My style of writing is not what turns well to the making of pots of money,' knew the serious cash lay elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="24"> Some literary figures suspected Forman and Wise were up to something.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="25"> But the two were not finally unmasked until 1934, by which time Forman had been dead for 17 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="26"> Forman was born in 1842 in the west country and joined the Post Office in London in 1860.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="27"> In his spare time he was a poetry critic and, along with Trollope, ranks among the Post Office's literary luminaries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="28"> He lived in some comfort in Camberwell, was married to Laura, and knew George Eliot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="29"> Wise came from more humble origins, but was a successful broker and lived in Islington.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="30"> For some time he had admired Forman's scholarship from afar, but it was to be several years before the two met and conspired.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="31"> Both were members of the Browning Society: Forman was afounder, and Wise joined in 1882.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="32"> Both were also to become members of the Shelley Society.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="33"> A closer relationship seemed inevitable, and in January 1886 Wise, then 27, was invited to Forman's house.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="34"> By this time, Forman's literary reputation was considerable.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="35"> He had begun modestly in 1869 with an article on D G Rossetti published anonymously in Tinsley's magazine.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="36"> Slowly but surely his name became part of the literary scene.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="37"> In 1871, Tinsley published Forman's first book 'Our Living Poets,' and 10 years later he took his first steps into forgery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="38"> His method then was to determine the course of the extraordinary forging operation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="39"> Richard Hengist Horne, an eccentric poet and one of the subjects of 'Our Living Poets', had written in 1867 an odic cantata for the Duke of Edinburgh called 'Galatea Secunda'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="40"> It was never published.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="41"> In 1881, Forman published it with a 'Melbourne, 1867' imprint.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="42"> The first edition imprint, albeit of false provenance, increased the value considerably.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="43"> Their subtle game was afoot.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="44"> There is no indication that Horne ever saw the edition: if he did, perhaps he thought of it as a quaint conceit, suggests Collins in his book.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="45"> When Horne died in 1884, Forman was left all Horne's books and papers and appointed his literary executor.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="46"> He later sold many of the works, including Lot 108 which contained 'Galatea Secunda' 'privately published in Melbourne 1867'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="47"> He netted Pounds 200, about half his annual salary.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="48"> He had started to make money as a forger.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="49"> By the time Wise arrived on his doorstep in 1886 Foreman was ready for a full-scale conspiracy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="50"> The idea was immensely seductive to Wise.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="51"> 'The cost of 30 or 40 copies of a slim pamphlet might be Pounds 6 or Pounds 7; the unit cost therefore about 3s 6d or 4s: and one copy could sell for Pounds 100 (about Pounds 1,500 today).</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="52"> This was one of the most attractive commodities Wise had dealt in'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="53"> Collins suggests that while Wise entered his new role with alacrity, Forman, though at first helpful, was later dragged kicking and screaming in his wake.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="54"> 'But once in the secret he could not get out: Wise had the drop on him'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="55"> The forging began in earnest, using as a printer Richard Clay of Bread Street Hill in the City of London.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="56"> J R Maylett, foreman at Clays, may have known something was amiss (perhaps he was bribed, suggests Collins) but to Cecil Clay, managing director, Wise was just another customer.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="57"> First a collection of Robert Browning poems was reprinted with a false imprint giving a date before the poems were written, then some Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnets were given the Forman-Wise treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="58"> A selection of George Eliot sonnets, first printed in 1874, was reprinted by the forgers in 1887 bearing an 1869 imprint.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="59"> Wise added a bogus note of provenance to many of these works.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="60"> Tennyson's 'The Last Tournament' was published in 1896 but bore an inscription handwritten by the supposed printer: 'Not more than 20 copies.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="61"> Strahan - Ludgate Hill, 1871'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="62"> However, at least one bookseller, Bertram Dobell, had doubts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="63"> In 1888 he wrote: 'Shelley Society meeting: Wise is still proceeding on his wild career of reprinting or pirating Browning'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="64"> By 1890, Swinburne, Ruskin, William Morris, Tennyson and Thackeray had been subjected to the forgers' treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="65"> Several fake volumes were sold to the British Museum.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="66"> Perhaps the most celebrated forgery was of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's so-called 'Reading sonnets'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="67"> It was, writes Collins, 'a daring stroke which showed how high the forgers' confidence was rising.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="68"> By forging Browning's sonnets Wise and Forman were tampering with the most celebrated literary love story of Victorian England'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="69"> They published the poems in 1894, bearing the imprint 'Reading, 1847'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="70"> For more than 40 years it had been believed that the first publication of the sonnets was in Elizabeth's 'Poems' of 1850.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="71"> But in March 1894, a note appeared in an obscure Philadelphia literary journal saying a Browning rarity had turned up: an 1847 edition of the sonnets.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="72"> In spite of the Reading imprint there was no printer's name and nothing to indicate it had been produced in that town.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="73"> It had, of course, been designed by Forman and Wise and printed by Clays in the City.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="74"> Yet few eyebrows were being raised at the plethora of pamphlets and books produced by Forman and Wise.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="75"> There was to be some minor sniping at the forgeries from about 1909, but nothing serious.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="76"> It was much later, in the 1930s, that the two forgers were unmasked.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="77"> Their downfall was brought about by two young booksellers, Graham Pollard and John Carter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="78"> Pollard, a colourful character, claimed to have got an Oxford half-blue in spitting, achieved by beating Evelyn Waugh over a 10ft distance.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="79"> Carter had been a scholar and taken a double First in Classics.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="80"> Carter was soon on the case of the Reading sonnets: he knew there was no copy in Browning's library; no copy in an old binding; and no copy with any signature inscription or mark of provenance before about 1900.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="81"> But this was all negative evidence.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="82"> It was Pollard who gathered the positive evidence through research into the chemical history of 19th-century paper.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="83"> Analysis of paper from an edition of the sonnets owned by a Flora Livingston showed it contained a significant proportion of chemical wood pulp: a substance not used in England until 1874.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="84"> The book could not have been published in 1847.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="85"> Carter tried writing to Wise, but the reply he received was of a vague general and dismissive nature.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="86"> But it was the beginning of a dogged process which was to assume the working title of 'Wise-cracking' and the Reading sonnets remained the cornerstone of the investigation.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="87"> By June 1934, the embattled Wise faced ruin.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="88"> News placards in the street read: 'Famous books denounced as forgeries' and 'Faked First Edition Sensation'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="89"> The articles were based on a book by Carter and Pollard with the gentle, donnish title of 'An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain 19-Century Pamphlets'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="90"> In the book, all paths seemed to lead to Wise's door: but without absolute proof they couldn't name him as the forger.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="91"> Carter and Pollard wrote: 'Mr Wise by his credulity, by his vanity in his own possessions, by his dogmatism, by abuse of his eminence in the bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige of an honourable science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt. . . ' The Daily Herald newspaper despatched a reporter to track down Wise: again his defence was unconvincing - and he tried to put the blame on Forman.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="92"> Three years later, Wise too, was dead.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="93"> Wise and Forman are part of a long tradition of literary forgers: Thomas Chatterton, piler-up of poetry, William Henry Ireland (who as Shakespeare got his play 'Vortigem' on to the stage - although without success) and John Payne Collier, Shakespeare's dodgy biographer.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="94"> Perhaps Bernard Shaw's view that the whole thing should be treated as a joke is the right one.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="95"> Did not the rich book collectors deserve to be humbugged by the forgers? asks Collins in his book.</s>

<s docid="FT922-1758" num="96"> The fact remains that Wise and Forman acted illegally, defrauding both buyers and authors.</s>
