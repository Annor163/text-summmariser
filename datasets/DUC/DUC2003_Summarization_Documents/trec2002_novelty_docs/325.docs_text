<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="10"> The Cuban-American "godfather" of a drug-smuggling and satanic cult accused of 15 slayings ordered one of his followers to kill him and his right-hand man as police closed in on their Mexico City hide-out, arrested cult members said Sunday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="11"> Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 24, the so-called "witch" of the cult, told reporters that her boyfriend and leader, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, "demanded to be killed because he said everything was finished".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="12"> Recounting the final minutes before their capture in a shoot-out with police Saturday, Aldrete told a press conference that Constanzo became desperate.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="16"> Before a crowd of reporters at the Mexico City attorney general's office, Aldrete pointed to fellow cult member Alvaro de Leon and said: "He killed him.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="17"> (Constanzo) ordered him to do it".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="18"> Police found the bullet-riddled bodies of Constanzo, 27, and Martin Quintana Rodriguez, 25, in the closet of a Mexico City apartment Saturday afternoon.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="19"> They said Constanzo was identified from fingerprints and from his U.S. passport.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="20"> Aldrete, De Leon, 22, and Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, 23, were arrested at the apartment, the attorney general's office said.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="21"> Later in the day, officials said they arrested Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez, 29, and Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra, 43, who had been renting the apartment for Constanzo.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="22"> All five were presented to reporters at the attorney general's office, where they stood behind a table bearing confiscated cult items, including artifacts allegedly used during religious rituals in the apartment.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="23"> Among them were black candles, a blindfolded statue of St. Anthony, jagged swords, a wax skull draped with beads, women's black clothing and singed $20 bills.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="24"> U.S. and Mexican police had sought Constanzo and Aldrete since early April, when the first of 15 bodies was found at a ranch outside Matamoros, a border city across from Brownsville, Tex.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="25"> Among the victims found at the border ranch was Mark Kilroy, 21, a University of Texas student who disappeared March 14 in Matamoros.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="26"> The Constanzo group practiced Santeria, a Caribbean religion with West African roots whose adherents usually sacrifice animals but not humans.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="27"> However, Constanzo and his followers reportedly made the ritualistic human sacrifices to seek the devil's protection from police for their marijuana-smuggling activities.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="29"> Kilroy apparently was selected at random when Constanzo ordered his henchmen to bring him an Anglo male.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="30"> De Leon, a bearded man dressed in slacks and a dirty white shirt, showed reporters arrow-shaped tattoos that he said Constanzo had drawn on his shoulder as part of a cult ritual.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="31"> De Leon said he joined the cult for protection after committing another, unrelated, murder in Matamoros.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="32"> He said Constanzo told his followers that the human sacrifices would make things "go better for us in the future, that we would receive protection".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="33"> De Leon said he took part in the killings of Kilroy and some of the others on the ranch.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="34"> But he and Aldrete indicated that Constanzo had carried out most of the killings himself.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="35"> Asked who killed Kilroy, Aldrete said: "Adolfo".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="36"> De Leon said Constanzo "went crazy" when he realized that the police had found them at the apartment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="37"> "He grabbed a bundle of money and threw it and began shooting out the window," De Leon said.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="41"> I had to do it" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="42"> Aldrete denied any involvement in the cult's slayings and said she was not even aware of them until she saw the bodies of some of the victims on television.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="43"> "When I saw the things on the television, watching all the sacrifices and all that, I just. . . . It was amazing," Aldrete said .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="44"> Asked if she was in love with Constanzo, she said: "I did not love him, but I followed him".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="45"> Aldrete said she was sorry about the deaths of Kilroy and the others.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="46"> "I feel sorry because when he disappeared I was trying to help the (Kilroy) family," she said in response to reporters' questions.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="47"> She did not elaborate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="48"> "If I had known it was like this, I wouldn't have been in it," she said of the cult.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="49"> Constanzo and Aldrete, missing since the first bodies were uncovered on the Matamoros ranch, were among 11 people named in the United States in a four-count drug indictment.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="57"> FBI agent Bob Nixon in Brownsville agreed.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="58"> "It's great," Nixon said.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="59"> "It will save us from having to extradite them" to Mexico.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="60"> "The only reason we were looking for them was so we could extradite them to Mexico so they could be tried there," Nixon said.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0036" num="61"> "The only purpose of the drug indictments here was to have probable cause to pick them up and turn them over to Mexico".</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="11"> Other members of the cult called her their witch, a high priestess in a world of evil.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="12"> Her name is Sara Aldrete Villareal, and she, like the others still alive, is accused of murder.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="13"> She is a tall, athletic woman who, in one half of her life, was an honors student at a Texas college.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="14"> But in the other, the one few people saw, she was a lover and follower of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whose legacy is a trail of grotesque violence almost beyond imagination.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="15"> She said this man, through the sheer force of his personality, held her in his grip, just as he did the others who killed for him.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="18"> "I don't even know why, but you will do it".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="19"> Ultimately, it would be Aldrete who ran screaming from a besieged Mexico City apartment, telling the police that Constanzo was dead, that he had ordered his own execution.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="20"> It was a lurid ending to a yearlong saga of death precipitated by Constanzo, who had convinced his followers that killing was the key to protection from being caught smuggling drugs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="21"> U.S. and Mexican police believe that members of the cult killed 15 people in Matamoros, just across from the Texas border city of Brownsville.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="22"> Among them was Mark Kilroy, a college student on spring break whose disappearance began a manhunt that eventually led to the discovery of the cult and of the bodies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="23"> On Monday, Aldrete, Alvaro de Leon and three other cult members were indicted in Mexico City on charges of homicide and related counts in connection with the slayings.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="25"> Police believe that Constanzo and his sect may also be responsible for nine Mexico City deaths that bore what has become a sect trademark: the removal of spinal columns to make good-luck necklaces.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="26"> In one sense, the horror resembles the Tate-La Bianca murders by Charles Manson's followers 20 years ago and the mass suicide by the followers of the Rev. Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="27"> In both those cases, one man mesmerized others into believing that evil is good and into committing diabolical acts as a result.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="28"> But this case goes further.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="29"> Constanzo practiced his magic in Mexican high society, winning adherents with his ceremonies to drain away evil.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="30"> And he took a religion born in the Congo and changed it to meet his own needs, including offering its protective spell to drug dealers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="31"> The religion, called Palo Mayombe, embraces animal sacrifice.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="32"> Constanzo convinced his followers that human sacrifice was even more powerful.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="33"> From the moment he saw the grisly scene at an isolated ranch outside Matamoros, Rafael Martinez knew he was looking at Palo Mayombe.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="34"> The cauldron, the human remains and the bow and arrow were all part of the rituals of the religion that was brought to the Caribbean during the slave trading days.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="35"> At first, police used the terms "voodoo killings" and "satanic murders" after discovering the mass graves early last month.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="36"> But it fell to Martinez, a cultural anthropologist from Miami, to tell officials that they had encountered Palo Mayombe, to which human sacrifice was added.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="37"> With Palo Mayombe in the background, Constanzo must have been used to sacrificing goats, chickens and pigs, said Martinez.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="38"> "To him, sacrificing humans was the next logical step," he added.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="39"> By Martinez's estimate, there are roughly 40,000 Palo Mayombe followers in the United States.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="40"> Most practice the religion in their homes, where it will not be seen by others.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="41"> And, Martinez said, it is also the religion of choice for many drug dealers, who use it to protect themselves and to put curses on their enemies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="42"> "Palo Mayombe is mostly malevolent and evil," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="43"> As Martinez walked through the murder site, he saw all the things associated with Palo Mayombe: the iron cauldron, called a nganga; the cigars and cheap liquor called "firewater"; the candles.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="44"> Then, too, there was Constanzo's diary, in which notations were made in both Spanish and Bantu, the language of the Congo tribes that originated the religion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="45"> "He really knew his Palo Mayombe," said Martinez.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="46"> Constanzo grew up in the Miami suburb of Hialeah, where neighbors said there was always something eerie about his family's home.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="47"> The back yard was filled with animals, the yard was often knee-high in weeds and decapitated animals were sometimes found on neighbors' front steps after an argument with one of the Constanzos.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="48"> His mother was once arrested when police found her living in a tiny apartment with several children and 27 animals.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="49"> The floor was covered with blood, urine and feces.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="50"> Constanzo grew up handsome, with reddish hair and light skin and found occasional work as a model.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="51"> In 1984, he moved from Miami to Mexico City, beginning a portion of his life that changed him from an ambitious, good-looking young man to an immensely wealthy drug dealer who drove an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz and bought cars for friends on a whim.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="52"> Not much is known about Constanzo during those early years in Mexico City.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="53"> But he is remembered as someone who swiftly developed a reputation as a sorcerer skilled at ridding the body of evil.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="54"> An Egg and Fragrant Water</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="55"> Constanzo performed limpias, or "cleansings," an ancient rite from Mexico's Indian and Spanish cultures that is still in use today, even among some members of the well-educated Mexican middle class.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="56"> In one form, the sorcerer passes an egg over the client's body, sometimes accompanied by fragrant water or the leaves of a plant.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="57"> Then the egg is cracked into a glass of water, and the sorcerer claims to read the patterns of evil that are being absorbed from the client's body.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="58"> As his fame grew, Mexican movie stars, musicians and other notables turned to him for cleansings.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="59"> Florentino Ventura, the former Mexican head of Interpol, the international police agency, has been identified as one of Constanzo's clients.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="60"> Ventura committed suicide last year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="61"> At the other end of the spectrum, drug smugglers would pay him $50,000 to provide them mystical protection from the law.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="62"> And then, at some point, Constanzo himself moved into the world of drug smuggling.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="63"> He joined up with a smuggler named Elio Hernandez from Matamoros, then slowly became a larger player in the operation, police on both sides of the border said.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="64"> He initiated Hernandez into his bizarre sect of animal sacrifice.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="65"> By this time, Aldrete was already a part of the cult, and she acted as the godmother in Hernandez's initiation ceremony.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="66"> Cult members, in their confessions, have said that the first two murders had nothing to do with religion but were acts of revenge for drug deals gone bad.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="67"> Lt. George Cavito of the sheriff's department in Cameron County, Tex., said that until 10 months ago, Constanzo was merely a drug dealer with a propensity for cheating and killing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="68"> He was also someone who demanded strict obedience.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="72"> The ritual killings began early last year.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="73"> In all, five people were murdered and mutilated in cult sacrifices; the other 10 found in the Matamoros graves were drug-related murder victims.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="74"> "When they needed someone for human sacrifice, they would just go get him," said Cavito.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="75"> Mark Kilroy and his pals were out late, drinking and carousing in the Zona Rosa section of Matamoros.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0033" num="76"> It was spring break, and revelry on the Mexican side of the border was something of a rite of passage for Texas college students vacationing on nearby South Padre Island.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-843" num="25"> The students retaliated by burning a Peugeot 504 saloon car, said to belong to a cult member; by interrogating two cult suspects who were paraded naked before a crowd of 400; and by setting fire to the household effects of one member of the university administration suspected by the students to have left detained alleged cult suspects go free.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="10"> The leader of a religious cult, arrested Sunday at a National City motel in the ritualistic slayings of an Ohio family, had been in Chula Vista in mid-December to cache guns, ammunition and paramilitary gear, authorities learned Monday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="11"> While police combed Southern California on Monday for the two remaining fugitives indicted in the killings, law enforcement authorities nationwide were left to speculate why defrocked minister Jeffrey D.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="12"> Lundgren -- and his entourage -- came to the San Diego region, how long they had been in the area and what they intended to do with the weapons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="13"> Preparing for an extradition hearing today, prosecutors' leading theory was that Lundgren, his wife and family were preparing to flee to Mexico to evade police.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="14"> But they also were studying the "rumor" that Lundgren experienced a "vision" that told him to go to Mexico, said Steven C.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="15"> LaTourette, a Lake County, Ohio, prosecutor.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="16"> Federal agents coordinating the nationwide search that led to Lundgren's arrest said they had "no direct ties" linking him to San Diego.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="17"> "We have not been able to determine why he came here," said April Freud, a spokeswoman at the San Diego office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="18"> Federal agents confirmed only that Lundgren had rented a self-storage locker Dec. 17 in Chula Vista and had filled it with weapons, ammunition and military-style gear, Freud said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="19"> When agents searched the locker late Sunday afternoon, they found a handgun, two rifles, a shotgun, explosive powder, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a fire ax and gas masks, Freud said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="20"> Earlier Sunday, when ATF agents and National City police arrested Lundgren, 39, a defrocked minister of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, they found four guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, gas masks and canteens at his Santa Fe Motel room.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="21"> At the motel, agents also arrested Lundgren's wife, Alice; his oldest son, 19-year-old Damon P.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="22"> Lundgren, and took temporary custody of three of the couple's younger children.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="23"> Lundgren, his wife and oldest son refused extradition Monday and were being held at San Diego County jails, Deputy Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="24"> Atty. John Hewicker said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="25"> Charges for the father and son included five counts of aggravated murder with Ohio's death-penalty specifications, prosecutor LaTourette said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="26"> The three younger children -- Jason, 15; Kristen, 10, and Jason, 9 -- were in "safe hands" in San Diego, Freud said, but declined to elaborate.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="27"> The arrests Sunday left police seeking only two of the 13 cult members indicted in Ohio in the killings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three young daughters, authorities said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="28"> Kathryn Renee Johnson, 36, and Daniel David Kraft, 25, last seen Saturday in San Diego, were believed to be driving a light blue 1986 Nissan pickup truck, Freud said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="29"> The vehicle has a silver camper top, a dented front fender and either Ohio or Missouri license plates, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="30"> "We still anticipate them to be in the Southern California area," Freud said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="31"> It is "highly probable" that the pair is "armed and dangerous," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="32"> The bodies of the Averys -- Dennis, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42, and their daughters, Trina, 13; Rebecca, 9, and Karen, 5 -- were found last week buried in a barn near Kirtland, Ohio, which is near Cleveland.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="33"> The faces, heads and feet of all five were bound with duct tape, and each had been shot at least twice.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="34"> The Averys were identified as one-time followers of Lundgren, who had declared himself the "prophet" of his own religion after his 1988 break with the church.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="35"> The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is not related to the larger Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints based in Salt Lake City, although both groups base their beliefs on the Book of Mormon and the Bible.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="36"> According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, investigators believe the Averys were killed last April in a sacrifice performed so that the rest of Lundgren's group could travel to the wilderness, where they could be cleansed and search for a "golden sword".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="37"> The killings were not discovered until an informer mentioned them on New Year's Eve, officials said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="38"> The Averys were killed with a.45-caliber handgun, and prosecutor LaTourette said he was hoping that the murder weapon would turn up in the Chula Vista storage locker.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="39"> The locker, however, yielded a 9-millimeter handgun, two semiautomatic rifles and a shotgun, Freud said .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="40"> Police recovered a.45-caliber handgun at the motel room.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="41"> Freud said it, like the other weapons, would be sent to an ATF laboratory in San Francisco for ballistics and fingerprint tests, but authorities could not yet identify it as the murder weapon .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="42"> The killings occurred during a one-hour period sometime between April 16 and 18 on a farm owned by the 29-member cult, which lived communally.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="43"> Neighbors said the group left the house hurriedly in mid-April, leaving behind chickens and rabbits.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="44"> They became somewhat nomadic, authorities said, traveling first to West Virginia, then to southwestern Missouri, then to the suburbs of Kansas City and Independence, Mo.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="45"> Since Friday, when seven members of the cult were arrested in Kansas City, Mo., law enforcement officials in nine states had been searching for Lundgren and his family.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="46"> Lundgren rented a 5-by-4-foot locker at Security First Self Storage in Chula Vista on Dec. 17, paying $56 for two months' rent at $28 a month, manager Doug Reed said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="47"> The contents were moved between 1:55 and 2:45 p.m. the next day, Dec. 18, Reed said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="48"> Records do not indicate any further visits to the locker, Reed said, adding that he would not have allowed weapons to be moved in if he had known about them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="49"> He said he "couldn't believe it" when agents removed guns and ammunition.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="50"> "They just seemed like average, everyday people," Reed said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="51"> Because of the Dec. 17 rental, police had "reason to believe (Lundgren) has been in the area for approximately a month," Freud said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="52"> That suspicion has not been confirmed, though, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="53"> She added, "It's sheer speculation as to where they came from or how they got here".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="54"> The Lundgren family checked in last Wednesday night at the Santa Fe Motel under a bogus name, motel managers said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="55"> The room, at $37.80 a night, had been paid for through today, they said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="56"> Johnson and Kraft may have visited, because "we were told that at one time eight people were in that room," Freud said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="57"> "But we don't know whether those people were visiting or staying overnight.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="58"> And we don't know the identity of those other people for sure".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="59"> Five of the seven members of the cult arrested in Kansas City have waived extradition to Ohio, LaTourette said Monday.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="60"> He said he is heading to Missouri today to discuss the other two cases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0026" num="61"> An eighth member, Sharon Blunchly, waived extradition Monday in Bay City, Mich., LaTourette said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="6"> THE CAPTURE of the mysterious leaders of the White Brotherhood cult this week may have ended one of the more bizarre episodes in Ukraine's post-Soviet history.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="7"> Ukraine has hyperinflation, hazardous nuclear weapons and energy shortages, but over the past two weeks the authorities have been preoccupied with reports of thousands of young cult followers flocking to Kiev to join their 'living god on this earth' in a mass suicide.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="8"> Fearing the worst and inexperienced in dealing with fringe religious groups, police detained more than 800 cult members while the authorities launched an aggressive propaganda campaign.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="9"> The White Brotherhood, which claims 150,000 members from all over the former Soviet Union, chose the St Sophia Cathedral Square in Kiev as its gathering place to await the end of the world and to witness the crucifixion and resurrection of its leader, Maria Devi Khristos, a self-proclaimed messiah.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="10"> In city streets as far away as Moscow there are posters of the Maria Devi Khristos - whose real name is Maria Tsvygun - a young dark-eyed woman clad in a white priestly robe with gold trim and turban.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="11"> She comes from eastern Ukraine and was formerly a member Komsomol, the communist youth league, and a journalist.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="12"> Last week the cult said the apocalypse and their mass suicide would take place on November 24.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="13"> But later they re-scheduled doomsday to November 14 and modified their mass suicide plan to a re-enactment of the Christ story, in which their leader is the next coming of Jesus Christ and President Leonid Kravchuk is Pontius Pilate.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="14"> Maria Devi Khristos and the cult's reputed mastermind, Yuri Krivonogov, came out of hiding last Wednesday, when police arrested them in the 11th century St Sophia Cathedral, the oldest house of worship in the Slavic Orthodox faiths.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="15"> Even from jail, the cult leaders insist the end of the world is imminent and say they have fulfilled their promise to their followers by reaching the cathedral.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="16"> Their followers keep coming to Kiev.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="17"> Ukrainian authorities are baffled.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="18"> Their instinctive reaction has been to lock the cult followers in jails, throw them into psychiatric wards or deport them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="19"> Dozens of police patrol St Sophia Square.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="20"> But it has been calm since the arrests with only reporters standing by and parents of runaway children hoping to spot their loved ones.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="21"> Wednesday's arrests took place after cult members, disguised as tourists, gained entry to the church and started chanting.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="22"> Museum attendants called the police.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="23"> As policemen tried to seize the cult members, a scuffle broke out.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="24"> One policeman suffered a fractured skull and about Dollars 1,600 in damage was caused to the cathedral.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="25"> Almost 400 of the detained cult members are on hunger strike.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="26"> Rather than release the prisoners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has decided to wait until 'they fall unconscious from hunger' so that they can be 'force-fed'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="27"> The authorities' anti-White Brotherhood propaganda campaign, has stirred up hysteria among Ukraine's 52m people.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="28"> Radio broadcasts warn parents to keep their children off the streets and out of the cult's hypnotic grasp.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="29"> State-controlled television airs Interior Ministry reports, showing tearful parents who have lost their loved ones to the cult and angry citizens who urge that the Brotherhood be 'liquidated'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="30"> The Brotherhood is accused of inciting fear, hatred and suicide.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="31"> Some Kiev schools have shortened their day to make sure students get home before sundown.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="32"> A rock station called upon those with extra-sensory powers to help cult members 'rejoin society'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="33"> The Ukrainian Orthodox Church Filaret, one of the church's highest officials, has denounced the White Brotherhood as the 'anti-Christ'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="34"> The propaganda campaign has drawn relatives of runaways and missing people from all over Ukraine, Russia and Byelorussia to prisons in Ukraine to find lost children and spouses.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="35"> Vera Sobuleva and her young daughter Anya were among about 30 relatives knocking on the doors of the Kiev Detention Centre prison last week.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="36"> Her 17 year old son, Kolya, disappeared a month ago on a trip from his polytechnical institute to his home Lipetsk.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="37"> Mrs Sobuleva did not know for certain if her son, with whom she has had a 'difficult relationship', was in Kiev but she immediately packed her bags and made the three-day trip after watching television reports.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="38"> 'On television they said that the White Brotherhood is taking, kidnapping children.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="39"> They said to come to the detention centre to take our children back,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="40"> Mrs Sobuleva did not find Kolya in the prison, but other parents have found their children.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="41"> In the prison, the cult members are calm and spend most of their time chanting Maria Devi Khristos' name.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="42"> Most refuse to reveal their names or ages or talk about their lives before they joined the cult, explaining: 'All this is unimportant and meaningless'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="43"> 'We are honest before god,' said one young bearded man, 'we were singing on the streets and they've illegally arrested us.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="44"> All we want is to meet our Maria Devi Khristos.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="45"> She's supposed to reveal herself'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="46"> A young woman, clutching a pink rose and crocheted white shawl over her face, explained how they were 'carted off St Sophia's Square in trucks like animals.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="47"> We are people first of all and we have the right to our faith'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="48"> When asked about their faith, they referred reporters to the literature.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="49"> And literature, there is aplenty.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="50"> Already the Interior Ministry has confiscated over four tons of pamphlets and posters in apartments around Kiev.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="51"> In its 'Godly-Cosmic-Programme,' the White Brotherhood offers love and salvation for those who have complete faith in Marina Devi Khristos and condemns those who do not to hell.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="52"> Tamara Yustinovskaya, whose son joined the brotherhood, has formed a parents' support group called Relief.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="53"> Relief has taken issue with the authorities' tactics and argues that the children 'need help, not punishment'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="54"> She said the children are 'zombie-like robots. . . programmed for death'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="55"> But the Soviet-style psychiatric regime in Ukraine is ill-prepared to deal with the cult.</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="56"> At a round table, sponsored by the Internal Ministry, one psychiatrist asked, 'What can we do?</s>

<s docid="FT934-8727" num="57"> They won't take food or talk to us.'</s>

<s docid="FT944-16074" num="7"> The Swiss authorities said yesterday that the 'guru' of the Order of the Solar Temple, Luc Jouret, wanted for murder since the discovery of the bodies of 53 followers in Switzerland and Canada last week, died with his disciples.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16074" num="8"> Investigating judge Jean-Pascal Jaquemet, heading the inquiry into 25 deaths last week in the Alpine village of Granges-sur-Salvan, said Jouret's body had been formally identified among the dead.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16074" num="9"> The deaths of Joseph Di Mambro, the dictatorial 'pope' of the order, and Camille Pilet, the Swiss businessman who acted as the sect's treasurer, were confirmed by police earlier this week.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16074" num="10"> In recent days, speculation was rife that Jouret had set up his fellow cult members and escaped with the sect's considerable financial assets.</s>

<s docid="FT944-16074" num="11"> Jouret was a Belgian-born 46-year-old homeopathic doctor whose charisma made him the cult's chief recruiter.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="8"> In a criminal case that attorneys say is unique in California for its prosecution of parents, a Santa Cruz couple was ordered Monday to stand trial in Vista Superior Court on felony charges that they kidnaped, falsely imprisoned and beat their adult daughter, who they believed was in the grips of a religious cult.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="9"> The pending trial is expected to pit the principles of religious freedom against parental concern for the well-being of their children.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="10"> The defense expects to produce a parade of former members of the religious group, who are expected to testify that they were brainwashed by the group's leader and were under his control until being rescued.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="11"> The case centers on 23-year-old Ginger Brown, a member of Great Among the Nations who was abducted in Encinitas last May and held for five days in an Escondido house while her parents, sisters and others tried to deprogram her.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="12"> On the fifth day, Brown was released and returned to the organization, a 16-member fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry based in Coronado that critics claim is a cult.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="13"> Sole Witness</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="14"> Brown was the sole prosecution witness against the five defendants in the case: her parents, Earle and Dorothy Rae Brown, both 57; her sister, Holly Rae Brown, 24; Clifford Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles, a self-proclaimed deprogrammer, and Hank Erler, 22, in whose Escondido home the deprogramming effort occurred.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="15"> Defense attorneys tried to show during the preliminary hearing before Vista Municipal Judge Michael Burley that the Browns and the other defendants believed that Ginger Brown had been brainwashed and that she was rescued for her own good.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="16"> But Brown testified that she is a dedicated member of Great Among the Nations by her own free will and had begged her parents to let her live her own life, no matter how religiously fanatic it might seem to them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="17"> On Monday, Benjamin Altschul, who leads the organization, testified that he held no control over members' actions, and that his only requirement of them is that "they believe in our Lord Jesus Christ".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="18"> One of the defense attorneys, John Patterson, said he might appeal Burley's decision because the judge stifled interrogation into the group's behavior on the grounds that a person's religious practices and beliefs cannot be put on trial.</s>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="19"> That area of questioning was important to the defense, however, in its effort to show that members of Great Among the Nations were brainwashed into following Altschul and financing what critics say is his lavish life style.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="20"> Another defense attorney, Saul Wright, said afterward, "Previous cult members will testify 100% to the contrary" on Altschul's benign characterization of the organization.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA051689-0064" num="24"> The five defendants are scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on June 5, although Earle Brown notified the court on Monday that he faces hospitalization for cancer treatment.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="11"> Soldiers had bullied her before, so Ruby Sioco wasn't especially scared when three heavily armed members of the local militia stopped and roughly searched her in this hamlet of bamboo huts one recent morning.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="12"> Nor did she worry when the leader, a man known as The Cat, ordered his men to hold her until he found her companions, three members of a leftist union's cultural group, farther down the dirt trail.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="13"> They were campaigning for a human rights rally, she explained.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="14"> But moments later, she heard three sharp bursts of gunfire.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="15"> "The Cat came back and said, 'Your three friends are dead,' " Sioco, 22, said.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="16"> "When he said that, I could not even cry.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="17"> I was too afraid.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="18"> "Then he told me, 'Go, run, escape'!</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="19"> But I don't run.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="20"> Because if I run, they will shoot me, too".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="21"> The Nov. 22 execution-style deaths of the three young union members at this remote sugar cane plantation on Negros Island are only the latest in what critics say is a grim series of brutal human rights abuses -- including murder, torture and rape -- in the Philippines' mostly forgotten war against Communist rebels.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="22"> While President Corazon Aquino's government has strict policies opposing such abuses in its counterinsurgency campaign, Amnesty International reports at least 40 "extra-judicial executions" of real or suspected opponents by government forces in the first eight months of 1990.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="23"> That, at least, is an improvement.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="24"> Last year, the London-based group reported more than 200 extra-judicial deaths and dozens of "disappearances" of human rights activists, church workers, trade unionists, journalists and other civilians.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="25"> Local human rights groups cite even higher figures, although verification is often impossible in the ever-violent, ever-murky world of Philippine politics.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="26"> Whatever the numbers, even top government officials concede that few if any members of the military, militia or police have been convicted of a serious human rights violation since Aquino came to power in 1986 promising an end to such abuses.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="27"> "As far as I know, yes, we have not secured any convictions," said Franklin M.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="28"> Drilon, Aquino's secretary of justice and head of the presidential human rights committee.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="30"> "Our difficulty is we are only prosecutors, and we can only prosecute on the basis of evidence," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="31"> "In many instances, either we cannot find witnesses or the witnesses are reluctant to testify".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="32"> That's not surprising.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="33"> "We've had enough cases where witnesses tell a story and then they are killed," explained a Manila-based Western official whose group deals with international humanitarian law.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="34"> "In most cases, nothing happens.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="35"> No one is arrested, no one is prosecuted".</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="36"> Even when cases are filed, "they die a slow death," charged Francisco B.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="38"> "It's all show," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="39"> Aquino's human rights record has tarnished her image in Washington, the United Nations and elsewhere, and it is a continuing source of discontent in a number of rural Philippine provinces.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="40"> In some areas, the abuses have further fueled the 21-year-old insurgency by the New People's Army, the armed wing of the banned Communist Party of the Philippines.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="41"> "Human rights is one of our primary concerns," said Gen. Renato de Villa, armed forces chief of staff.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="42"> "We're aware, very, very much aware that if the people are not with us, we cannot win this war".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="43"> International human rights groups and diplomats agree with De Villa's assertion that military and militia abuses decreased in the last two years, while abuses by NPA guerrillas -- including summary executions, torture, hostage-taking and harassment -- have not.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="44"> Early last year, for example, NPA guerrillas massacred 37 members of the anti-Communist Itoman religious sect in Digos, Davao del Sur, beheading some victims.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="45"> And last week, two suspected NPA gunmen burst into an Ateneo University classroom in Manila and shot to death two labor leaders holding a human rights seminar, the latest of more than 80 NPA assassinations in Manila this year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="46"> On the government side, military officials insist they file charges when warranted, but they blame other allegations on a leftist propaganda campaign to discredit the military.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="47"> And, indeed, many abuses are difficult to characterize in a violent, feudal culture that features bloodthirsty religious cults, armed vigilantes, private armies and bandit gangs, as well as a bitter guerrilla war that leaves an estimated 1,000 people dead each year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="48"> The problem is compounded because the military has labeled scores of trade unions and social activist groups, including human rights organizations, as "fronts" for Communists, effectively declaring them open targets.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="49"> And military officials invariably contend that dead civilians were killed in cross-fires or encounters with the NPA.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="50"> "It is much worse now compared to the time of (deposed dictator Ferdinand E).</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="51"> Marcos," said Joe Depiedra, 32, head of ARADO, a coalition of 22 legal leftist groups espousing agrarian reform.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="52"> "Before, the military never bombed rural areas.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="53"> We never had massacres.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="54"> We never had these vigilantes.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="55"> Now it is a regular thing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="56"> Negros, the fourth largest island in the Philippines, may be the worst-case example.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="57"> Negros is called "Sugarlandia" because it is home to thousands of sprawling sugar cane plantations run by a wealthy elite and worked by landless peasants.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="58"> Despite a $500-million industry and enough profits to pack baccarat tables nightly in a glitzy downtown casino, barely half the haciendas pay even the legal minimum wage: $2.20 a day.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="59"> Since the work is seasonal, tens of thousands of families survive day to day, in debt all their lives.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="60"> Children as young as 8 work in the tall cane fields.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="61"> Hunger is so bad in July and August, when the cane has been cut and the mills are quiet, that the season is called the tiempo muerto -- death time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="62"> "I have eight children, but they do not go to school," said Marcedita Dayo, 51, a third-generation cane worker in a dirt-floor thatch hut on Hacienda de la Rama, owned by a wealthy Manila-based landlord.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="63"> "I can't afford it.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="64"> What we earn is barely enough for rice".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="65"> As elsewhere, Aquino's promises of land reform were mostly empty.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="66"> About 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) were given to farmers, but the government hasn't broken up major plantations or acquired tens of thousands of hectares that planters offered to sell.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="67"> "It's very slow," admits vice governor Rafael L.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="68"> Coscolluela. "There are even voluntary offers that have not been touched".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="69"> War, however, has touched much of Negros Island.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="70"> An estimated 900 NPA guerrillas have killed dozens of planters, soldiers and civilians.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="71"> The military has responded with Vietnam-style offensives that have entailed evacuating tens of thousands of peasants while soldiers turned suspect villages into free-fire zones.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="72"> In April, 1989, for example, the army's "Operation Thunderbolt" in southern Negros forced about 30,000 so-called "internal refugees" into poorly planned evacuation centers.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="73"> With cramped quarters, inadequate sanitation and bad water, at least 200 already malnourished children died from measles and diarrhea.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="74"> In recent weeks, the military has used howitzers and helicopter gunships to assault an alleged NPA stronghold in the north of Negros, forcing about 2,000 farmers and their families into dusty schools, crowded churches and an open-air cockfighting pit in Minapasok town.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="75"> "Operation Habagat Alpha" has been accompanied by a surge in violence by fierce, anti-Communist religious cults that often work closely with the military.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="76"> The groups are named for their red, white and green headbands and are feared for reports that they behead their victims and drink the blood.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="77"> "The army is using these fanatic groups in the counterinsurgency war," said Vivian Vargas, head of the Negros Relief and Rehabilitation Center, a non-governmental group that helps the refugees.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="78"> "So far, we haven't heard of beheadings in the north.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="81"> But villagers say most abuses are by members of the militia.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="82"> The Citizens' Armed Forces Geographical Units, called CAFGUs, were created by Aquino in 1987 to replace Marcos' infamous Civilian Home Defense Force.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="83"> In theory, the new militia was recruited, trained and supervised by regular soldiers and subject to military discipline.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="84"> In practice, the CAFGUs often include members of Marcos' abusive militia and work with local vigilante groups.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="85"> Villagers complain that the CAFGUs steal pigs and chickens, drunkenly harass women at checkpoints and threaten to name them as NPA sympathizers if they resist.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="86"> On Negros, sugar planters and wealthy landlords openly finance the CAFGUs, contributing nearly $2 million a year to train, outfit and pay local units.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="87"> "These CAFGUs are used by the rich landowners to protect the haciendas," said retired Bishop Antonio Fortich, a human rights advocate whose office was hit by an unsolved grenade attack several years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0112" num="88"> "But they commit atrocities and there is no control".</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA051489-0009" num="262"> Manson's followers, says West, were enthralled by their leader's race-war delusions not only because of impairment by drugs but because of the group's twisted internal dynamics.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA051489-0009" num="266"> "The Manson clan," says Kay, "was a group of misfits that just came together kind of at the wrong place and the wrong time.</s>

<s docid="LA051489-0009" num="269"> By this reading, since bad sorts get together all the time, keeping the Tate-LaBianca killers in prison serves as not only retribution for old crimes but deterrence to modern sociopathic gangs.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="12"> San Diego police say they are investigating the reported kidnaping of Dina Geerling, 37, a longtime member of a group called Great Among the Nations who was reported abducted Thursday in the parking lot of her San Diego workplace.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="15"> Hers was the 10th abduction -- or rescue, or kidnaping, depending on various points of view -- in five years involving members of the group, which, up until Thursday, had 17 close-knit members.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="16"> The group calls itself a fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, while critics characterize it as a cult whose members finance what they say is the lavish life style of the group's leader, Benjamin Altschul.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="17"> Police Detective David Morris, who investigated three abductions of members when the group was in Tierrasanta, said he received a phone call Wednesday from "someone who is close" to Geerling's family, reporting that the woman would be released today unharmed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="18"> Morris said he considers the six days Geerling was held in custody, by unknown people at an unknown location, an apparent attempt to deprogram her.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="19"> Whether the abductors will be arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and false imprisonment or allowed to go free because they rescued her from the group will be determined after he talks to Geerling, Morris said.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="20"> "If she wants to prosecute, I'll arrest the people on the spot," Morris said.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="24"> It's not a kidnaping if they are rescuing her.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="29"> Gary Rempel, a deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the parents, sister and two other men on charges of kidnaping and falsely imprisoning group member Ginger Brown last year, said the law carefully defines when a person can be abducted from others and not face prosecution.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="30"> The criteria are met, Rempel said, if the person is taken away from a dangerous situation and promptly turned over to authorities for his own safety and well-being.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="31"> "If (the abductors) were truly concerned about her, I'm sure they would have delivered her forthwith to the police or the FBI," Rempel said.</s>

<s docid="LA042689-0030" num="41"> Rempel, the prosecutor, said he was surprised by Geerling's abduction, especially given the district attorney's decision to prosecute Brown's parents, sister and two men allegedly involved in her kidnaping and false imprisonment.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="26"> Geerling held a news conference to denounce what she said are the cult-like practices of the group and Altschul.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="27"> She then went to a San Diego police station to tell detectives she did not plan to press kidnaping charges against her abductors.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="28"> "She said it was not a kidnaping, but an act of love, a rescue," Detective David Morris said.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="30"> Morris said Geerling told him during a 50-minute meeting that Altschul is "totally controlling" the 17-member group, convincing the members that outsiders are evil, and monitoring basic activities such as telephone calls.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="34"> She painted a picture of Great Among the Nations as a small, tight-knit Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry that holds no sway over her emotions or decisions, but provides a spiritual foundation for her life.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="35"> Critics, among them former members, have characterized the group as a cult whose members finance what they say is the lavish life style of Altschul.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="37"> Brown testified that she was raised as a church-going person, encouraged by her parents to take part in religious activities ranging from Campus Crusade for Christ to the choir.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="41"> Brown asked them if they were in the San Diego area to participate in a rumored meeting between parents of several group members and a local television station in an attempt to drum up publicity to "break up the ministry," she testified.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="42"> Her parents, however, said they "just wanted to go for a ride" and ended up visiting her, Brown said.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="43"> Later, Brown watched a televised news segment on Great Among the Nations and saw her parents on the program.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="50"> After being shadowed by a mysterious van for several days, Brown said, she was jumped on May 12, 1988, by a large man who herded her down an embankment and into a waiting van manned by her father.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="51"> Tears welling in her eyes and her voice choking, Brown described how she was struck across the face, spit on and forced flat to the floor of the van during the trip to a remote house in rural northern Escondido.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="52"> She said one of the abductors beat her head four times against the floor and told her to stop screaming or he would kill her.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="53"> At the house, Brown was forced to sleep on the floor or was confined to a second-floor bedroom while constantly guarded, she said.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="54"> Her parents, sister, Daniels and Erler all participated in the deprogramming effort, she said.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="55"> Brown said her father at one point threatened to break her leg and that her mother refused her requests for a doctor's attention, instead giving her Tylenol.</s>

<s docid="LA051089-0043" num="56"> Through it all, she said, her parents insisted they were "doing this because we love you".</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="10"> Corral. On one end of a damaged wood bridge stood a Montana rancher, his video camera aimed at 14 outdoorsmen massed on the other end.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="11"> The hunters and fishermen had come to replace the planks the rancher had knocked out of the bridge and to tear down the barbed wire he had strung up to keep strangers away from his brother's cattle ranch.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="12"> And Ronald B. Stevens, leader of the outdoorsmen, was not about to back down.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="14"> "So if you want to call the sheriff, you better call him now".</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="15"> With that, Stevens and his companions spent an entire summer's day ripping up barbed wire and mending the bridge while Bill Brainard, the rancher, shot video footage to show his lawyers later.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="16"> At stake was entrance to hunting and fishing areas along Sixteenmile Creek, a stream about 45 miles northwest of Bozeman.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="19"> The confrontation at Sixteenmile Creek a year ago was resolved peacefully.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="20"> But it is a good example of a conflict being played out all across the United States.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="21"> The battle pits landowners entitled to privacy and control of their own property against outdoorsmen entitled to access to public lands.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="22"> Few Americans realize that many of the roads leading through or to their favorite woods, beaches and fishing streams cut across someone's land.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="23"> Twenty years ago, it didn't matter much.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="24"> Farmers and ranchers, especially in the West, traditionally allowed unrestricted access through their property.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="25"> But the Western ethic is changing rapidly as use of the wide-open spaces increases.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="26"> More people, particularly urban dwellers, want to make a home away from home on the range, and more landowners want them to go back where they came from.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="27"> As the conflict has intensified, others have been drawn into the fray: public officials from the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="41"> Hunters, fishermen, backpackers and bird-watchers flock to the open spaces in a quest for trophy elk, fat rainbow trout or simply a bit of solitude.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="42"> Many of these outdoorsmen arrive on foot and don't want roads to their favorite places built.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="43"> Yet each season, they are disturbed to find new fences smeared with orange paint -- the Montana no-trespassing symbol -- which prevent them from reaching thousands of acres they have visited in the past.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="44"> Like outdoorsmen, motorized sportsmen -- snowmobilers, dirt bikers and 4-wheel-drive enthusiasts -- are eager to head for the hills, if only for a day or a weekend.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="46"> Not surprisingly, such carelessness angers the quieter outdoorsmen and rural residents as well.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="47"> Longtime Montanans who once welcomed traditional field-and-stream types and wealthy out-of-staters who have moved to the area in the last 20 years are alarmed by the reckless hordes encroaching on their privacy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="48"> "Hordes" can mean five or 50 trucks of hunters on a November weekend.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="49"> That may not sound like much to a veteran of the Hollywood Freeway, but by the standards of a state like Montana -- fourth-largest in size and 44th in population, it's an invasion.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="70"> The skirmish that put Public Land Access on the map involved the Windy Water Ranch.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="73"> The ranch was bought in 1986 by millionaire Robert M. Lee, owner of Hunting World, an exclusive sporting goods store in New York City.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="74"> Hoping to provide a "protected habitat" for game animals, Lee later decided to close a portion of what locals knew as the Old Indian Trail where it passed through his land.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="75"> "Hunting pressure" from outfitters "has been so heavy in recent years," he explained in a letter to the Forest Service in 1987, that mature bull elk were seldom seen in the area.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="83"> Public Land Access sued Lee on the grounds that the trail was a prescriptive right of way -- that is, a historically used route -- and thus public.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="105"> "We're not pushing high-standard roads," Gibson countered, adding that the agency simply wants to offer the public reasonable ways to use the land.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="109"> One fight began over land owned by actor Warren Oates and "The Wild Bunch" director Sam Peckinpah.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="121"> In 1988, the Trust for Public Land acquired about 500 acres of the Oates-Peckinpah property for the Forest Service in exchange for four scattered parcels of public land elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="125"> The cult, formerly based in Calabasas, Calif., and led by Elizabeth Clare Prophet (known to her followers as Guru Ma), became the largest landowner in Park County in the 1980s when it bought Malcolm Forbes' 12,000-acre spread, and three other parcels bordering Yellowstone Park that totaled about 18,000 acres.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="129"> Several years ago, the Forest Service considered bringing condemnation proceedings against the church to regain access to parkland through its property.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="130"> Rather than pursue the long, costly hearings to condemn the land, though, the federal agency, the state and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation bought 3,400 acres of church land last year donated it to the federal agency.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="131"> The Forest Service then set aside the property as an elk habitat.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="132"> SUCH LAND EXCHANGES are "win-win" deals, according to Mike Williams, head of recreation and land in the Gallatin National Forest.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="133"> Many conservationists agree that donations of land to organizations such as the Nature Conservancy or the Trust for Public Land is the most equitable solution to the problems of access throughout the West.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="135"> The Forest Service also benefits because it avoids confrontations or condemnation proceedings.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="136"> Owners are happy because they either are paid for their land or receive a tax break for donating it.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="137"> "In 18 years, we have acquired over $500 million worth of real estate in 37 states," said Craig Lee of the Trust for Public Land's Seattle office, which handled the Sixmile exchange.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="138"> But it is important to note that the Trust for Public Land and other conservancy groups usually deal only with willing sellers.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="139"> So although land exchanges have decided several cases, they by no means can be expected to work in every instance.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="141"> After a yearlong study, the Keystone Center in Colorado, a nonprofit organization devoted to resolving difficult public policy conflicts, stated flatly that the access issue was at a critical stage.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="142"> In the 1988 study, Keystone also called for a national task force on access.</s>

<s docid="LA120990-0191" num="144"> In the meantime, the problem is not only "a question of signs and fences, maps and enforcement personnel," noted Derrick Crandall of the American Recreation Coalition, a nonprofit federation of private recreation interests.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="9"> In an abrupt conclusion to the Ginger Brown kidnaping trial, Superior Court Judge David B.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="10"> Moon Jr. on Friday dismissed the kidnaping and other charges against all five defendants, including the woman's parents, Earle and Dorothy Brown.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="11"> "Back in June, when I reviewed the entire file, I said to myself, 'Why is this case, at least to the Browns, in our criminal courts'?</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="12"> " Moon said Friday morning, surprising attorneys for both sides, who had gathered to argue whether charges that led to a hung jury on Thursday should be retried.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="13"> Instead, Moon told them he didn't see any reason to try the case further.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="14"> "This judge finds that no jury of 12 persons is ever going to unanimously agree on guilty verdicts," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="15"> "The chances of a prosecution on the remaining counts is virtually non-existent.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="16"> Perhaps a jury might reach a unanimous not-guilty verdict, but this judge isn't going to let the people's courtroom, of which we have precious few, be used to titillate the public's fascination with unusual religious groups.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="17"> We have other pressing business to transact in our trial courts.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="19"> "Accordingly, I conclude that further prosecution of these defendants on outstanding charges would serve no legal purpose".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="20"> The five defendants hugged, cried and smiled; the defense attorneys grinned and shook their heads, and the district attorney's office shrugged it off.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="21"> "In a sense, everybody in this case did his or her job," said Steven J.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="27"> "Ultimately, it's the community's job to speak out on this case -- and essentially the whole sorry story of alienated families -- and the jury has done that.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="28"> "Perhaps their failure to reach a decision tells a great deal about the deep ambivalence we have as a society, between family duty and personal freedom".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="29"> Charged with kidnaping, false imprisonment and battery were the elder Browns; one of their four daughters, Holly, 25; Los Angeles deprogrammer Clifford Daniels, 35, and Hank Erler, 23, in whose mother's Escondido home the unsuccessful five-day deprogramming attempt occurred in May, 1988.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="30"> The jury Wednesday acquitted Erler of most of the charges facing him, and pronounced not-guilty verdicts on false-imprisonment and battery against the two Brown women.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="31"> But Thursday, jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked on the remaining charges, including kidnaping, against the three Browns and Daniels.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="32"> The five defendants never denied abducting and holding Ginger Brown for five days to try to get her to disavow her allegiance to a group known as Great Among the Nations.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="33"> But they argued that they were baited to do it by Ginger Brown and the group's leader, Benjamin Altschul, so the daughter could later sue the defendants for monetary damages to help bankroll the small group.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="34"> The 17-member, Coronado-based Great Among the Nations describes itself as a fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, although parents of current and former members say it is a cult whose members are insidiously influenced to finance the comfortable life style of its leader.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="35"> Ginger Brown was freed on the fifth day of the deprogramming effort and returned to her group.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="36"> She was the prosecution's star witness against her parents and the others.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="37"> Brown, who was 22 at the time, testified that she was bruised and battered during the deprogramming attempt.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="38"> The defense argued that most of her injuries were self-inflicted so she could improve her case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="39"> Brown said Friday that she accepts Moon's ruling.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="40"> "I laid out my case to the court, the jury and the judge.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="41"> It was up to them.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="42"> It's time to go on with my life and my ministery," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="43"> Jurors said afterward that the very issue of whether Ginger Brown actually baited the kidnaping and consented to it was the key to their deliberations, and those who voted for acquittal said they didn't believe Ginger Brown's story.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="44"> "The only thing we agreed on was that nobody believed Ginger told the truth," juror Jim Lambert said.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="45"> "There were so many inconsistencies, we just didn't believe her".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="46"> He added: "We all agreed we were dealing with a cult".</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="47"> But he said some jurors "seemed to have chips on their shoulders because of their problems with their own parents" and weren't ready to wholly support the elder Browns, either.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="48"> Jurors noted that all four women on the jury voted across the board to acquit all the defendants on all the charges, but most said sympathy for the parents wasn't an issue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="49"> "We believed the Browns had evidence (their daughter was in jeopardy), even though we didn't have that evidence ourselves," said Paula DeMong, the presiding juror.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="50"> "We saw it as a group that wouldn't allow Ginger to see her family.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="51"> No one felt that the motives of Great Among the Nations were particularly honest".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="52"> DeMong said that, if she didn't believe Ginger Brown had consented to the kidnaping, "I would have voted to convict them -- with great sadness".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="53"> Some jurors said they were struck by Ginger Brown's emotionless, matter-of-fact testimony against her parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="54"> "She seemed so odd.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="55"> It made the jury curious, that she wasn't experiencing normal emotions, which we felt added weight to the brainwashing," DeMong said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="56"> She said jurors were bothered after viewing a videotape of Ginger Brown, taken by fellow group members after her release, that showed her laughing and joking about the experience.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="57"> Ginger Brown said she was not bothered by their criticism.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="58"> "There has been such slander against our group for the past two years that I'm beginning to get thick-skinned," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="59"> Friday's proceedings started with Deputy Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="60"> Atty. Gary Rempel telling Moon he was ready to retry the defendants on the hung counts and to continue his prosecution of them on several yet untried charges of conspiracy -- charges that were held in abeyance until the first charges were tried and resolved.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="61"> But Moon brought the discussion to a quick culmination, telling defense attorneys not to even bother to argue that charges should be dropped.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="62"> Then, in a 20-minute lecture in which he criticized both the defense and prosecution for some of their trial tactics and missed opportunities, Moon said he was dropping the remaining charges and was ready for everyone to go home.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="63"> Moon said he found fault with the case from the outset, but claimed he lacked the judicial discretion to unilaterally dismiss the major counts against the defendants -- especially after Earle Brown took the stand in his own defense and "virtually admitted every element of the crime and implicated each of his co-defendants," despite "deficiencies in the prosecution's prima facie case".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="64"> Had the defendants asked that the judge rule on the case instead of putting the facts in the hands of a jury, Moon said, he might have ended the proceedings shortly after they started, back in November.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="65"> But instead, he said, he had to let the jury process run its course.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="66"> "This prosecution will never, and I mean never ever, be stronger than it was at the conclusion of the defense case," Moon said.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="67"> "To put it succinctly, if the district attorney couldn't get a conviction from this evidence, they will never get a conviction.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="68"> "This jury heard a functional equivalent of a judicial, in-court confession.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="69"> It was not misled by having religion put on trial.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="70"> But it did hear a rather tragic story of a daughter's alienation from her family.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="71"> "Perhaps it was this last human -- but relevant -- portion of the case that had the jury considering jury nullification," Moon said, referring to the jury's dilemma of hearing hard evidence suggesting a technical violation of the law, but not wanting to apply the law against the Browns.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="72"> The district attorney's office agreed later that it had a hard case to try.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="73"> "You've identified a very thorny issue, which some would argue is fatal to this kind of prosecution," Casey said.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="74"> "This isn't a difficult case because of the facts.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="75"> It isn't difficult because of the law.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="76"> It's difficult because of the people.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="77"> This is not a robbery case.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="78"> It's a 'Father Knows Best' case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="79"> "You have a family of people we (prosecutors) have characterized as good and decent and nice people who felt themselves driven to a desperate act, out of love.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="80"> Unfortunately," said Casey, "that act is illegal".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="81"> Casey said prosecutors aren't second-guessing their decision to pursue the case, despite Moon's remarks from the bench.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="82"> "They admitted forcibly taking an adult woman who was violating no law off the street and holding her against her will.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="83"> "The judge observed in his comments that Earle Brown admitted virtually every allegation -- he copped out on the witness stand -- and still the jury didn't convict because of what the judge called the equities and we call sympathy.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="84"> Perhaps from a legal standpoint that's disappointing and from a human standpoint it's heartening".</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="98"> To a one, the five defense attorneys said they were astonished by Moon's decision, especially given the judge's rulings, which they said had consistently gone against their case -- including his fundamental ruling that the Browns could not be defended on the basis that they were motivated by a sense for Ginger Brown's welfare.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="100"> Added attorney John Patterson, "For once, the judge was right".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="101"> Among the options available to the court were to drop the charges against all but Daniels, who was considered by most jurors as the most likely to face a conviction because of his professional role in the snatching.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="102"> Moon said Daniels "has successfully hidden behind the Brown family shield".</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="103"> But he said that, since the prosecution chose to include Daniels among the five co-defendants, it shouldn't have "a second chance" to prosecute him alone.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="104"> "I do not condone any of Mr.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="105"> Daniels' actions.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="106"> In my view, they were outside the law," Moon said.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="107"> But he then wondered aloud whether kidnaping laws can be applied to these sorts of cases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="108"> "It may be argued that the prosecution of these deprogramming kidnaping cases deter abductions (of relatives) and deter vigilantes.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="109"> Perhaps our society will always struggle with this phenomenon," Moon said.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="110"> But he suggested that new laws be written to specifically address the abduction of family members for deprogramming purposes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="111"> Altschul said Friday that "everybody is relieved that we can go on to do our business".</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="112"> "However, there's a great need, a great desire on Ginger's part, to have her family come over to our side and become good Christians, to shake hands and ask for an excuse.</s>

<s docid="LA011390-0065" num="113"> Mr. Brown should stop excluding Ginger as a daughter because she doesn't go to his church," Altschul said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="8"> A Vista Superior Court jury finished its second day of deliberations in the Ginger Brown deprogramming trial after asking the court reporter Monday to reread several pieces of testimony by defense witnesses.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="9"> Defense attorneys said they were unsure whether the jurors' questions bode well for their case, but one of them, Herb Weston, noted, "They're looking at our defense, and that's good".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="10"> The nature of the jurors' questions suggested that the panel may be wondering how compelled Earle and Dorothy Brown might have felt in taking their daughter from the group known as Great Among the Nations for her own safety.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="11"> Superior Court Judge David B.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="12"> Moon Jr. had prohibited the defense from arguing that the Browns, another of their daughters, Holly, and two other co-defendants kidnaped Ginger Brown for her own sake.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="13"> He ruled they had been unable to prove in pretrial hearings that their daughter was in any jeopardy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="14"> "We couldn't talk that kind of defense, but maybe they're hearing it anyway," defense attorney Joe Judge said after hearing the jurors' questions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="15"> Some of the testimony that was read back to the jury was by Daniel Weinstein, a former member of Great Among the Nations, who said he went to speak to Ginger Brown during a five-day deprogramming effort in May, 1988, "to warn her about the apparent and imminent danger she was in".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="16"> Another area of testimony read to the jury was that of Earle Brown, who said he made his decision to "rescue" his daughter after receiving a transcript of a telephone conversation by Benjamin Altschul, the leader of Great Among the Nations, when he called members while in Israel.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="17"> Although the actual telephone transcripts were not admitted into evidence, the conversation had to do with alleged plans by Altschul to relocate the 17-member organization from San Diego to Israel.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="18"> The transcript of the telephone conversation was made by a former member of Great Among the Nations who later left the group and turned his information over to David Elichaa, a father of another former group member who has helped lead opposition to Altschul's organization.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="19"> Altschul and Ginger Brown say Great Among the Nations is a fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, but critics say it is a cult whose members have been influenced by Altschul to finance his comfortable life style.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="20"> The three Browns, deprogrammer Cliff Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles and Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido, are charged with kidnaping, false imprisonment and battery for the five-day deprogramming effort.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="21"> Deputy Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="22"> Atty. Gary Rempel said he was frustrated by the jurors' questions Monday.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="23"> "Those areas are totally inappropriate and getting away from the issues of the case and getting into areas of sympathy," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="24"> "There was no danger to Ginger Brown at any time, except when she was nabbed in daylight by the defendants themselves".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="25"> The jury gave no indication Monday as to the progress in its deliberations, even when subtly baited by Moon.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="26"> "I sent in some brownies earlier," the judge said, smiling to the jury.</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="27"> "Did they have any decision-making ingredients"?</s>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="28"> After a pause, he added quickly, "You don't have to answer that".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010990-0031" num="29"> "Maybe some more brownies," said Paula Demong, the presiding juror.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="8"> Ginger Brown, who was the prosecution's key witness in a criminal trial that ended with charges of kidnaping, false imprisonment and assault and battery against her parents, sister and others being dismissed, has dropped her own, $2.75-million civil lawsuit against them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="9"> Brown's dismissal was recorded Thursday in Superior Court, and word reached her parents and others Friday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="10"> "I'm delighted, for sure.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="11"> I'm pleased beyond words," said Dorothy Brown who, with her husband, Earle, were said by attorneys to be the first parents in the country to be charged with the kidnaping and false imprisonment of an adult child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="12"> Ginger Brown filed her civil suit one day short of a year after she was taken from a parking lot in Encinitas to an Escondido home where, for five days in May, 1988, deprogrammer Cliff Daniels tried to persuade her to sever her allegiance to a small religious organization known as Great Among the Nations, which her parents believed was a cult.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="13"> The district attorney filed criminal charges against Earle and Dorothy Brown, both 58, of Santa Cruz; Holly Brown, 25, one of their other daughters; Daniels, 35, of Los Angeles, and Hank Erler, 23, in whose mother's Escondido home the deprogramming effort occurred.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="14"> Although Earle Brown admitted in courtroom testimony that he and others took Ginger Brown in a deprogramming effort, defense attorneys argued that the daughter had baited her parents to take her so she could later sue them for monetary damages.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="15"> The filing of the civil lawsuit, the attorneys argued, lent credence to that theory.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="16"> During the trial, Ginger Brown said she intended to drop the civil lawsuit against her parents and the others, but, to the trial's end, the civil action remained active -- a fact that was known to the Superior Court jury deciding the case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="17"> The jury acquitted some of the defendants of some of the charges but was deadlocked on the most serious.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="18"> Superior Court Judge David B.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="19"> Moon Jr. then dismissed the case altogether, saying it never should have been brought to trial.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="20"> A spokesman for the district attorney's office said Friday that no decision has yet been made on whether to appeal Moon's decision that the case cannot be refiled.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="21"> According to court records, on Thursday, Brown, now 24, signed the necessary document to dismiss her civil lawsuit.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="22"> She could not be reached for comment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="23"> But her mother said she was relieved.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="24"> "I don't see how we could have physically, emotionally, financially or any other way have gone through another trial," Dorothy Brown said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="25"> Ginger Brown's attorney in the civil action, Caryle Christianson, had removed herself from the case last month and declined comment on Friday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="26"> But attorneys involved in the Browns' defense suggested Friday that Christianson dropped the case because she took it on contingency and saw little likelihood that the civil action would prevail, especially in the wake of the criminal charges being dismissed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="27"> Saul Wright, Earle Brown's defense attorney, said he was "relieved but not surprised" by the dismissal.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="28"> "It was a bad lawsuit from the beginning.</s>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="29"> I'm sure when they saw the reaction of our jury, they concluded it wouldn't be worth pursuing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021090-0080" num="30"> The lawsuit named not only each of the five people who faced the criminal charges, but others including former members of Great Among the Nations who met with Ginger Brown during the deprogramming effort to try to get her to renounce her allegiance to the group, which claims to be a fundamental Christian Bible study group and television evangelism ministry.</s>
</P>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="14"> It was the fourth annual Krishna festival at Main Beach Park, a time for spreading the good word about vegetarian diets, reincarnation and meditation.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="15"> But it was also a time for politics, a time when the Krishnas are trying to cultivate public good-will while they appeal an Orange County court case that could force them to sell seven temples, including one in Laguna Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="16"> (Except for one temple in Los Angeles, the other six temples are scattered around the country).</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="17"> As part of this public relations campaign, a group of about 30 Krishnas are participating in a 1,000-mile "walk for religious freedom" from San Francisco to Tijuana, said Tracey Killeen, 25, who joined the movement three years ago in Boston.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="21"> After Robin George returned home in 1977, she and her mother sued the Krishnas and won a $32.5-million judgment.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="22"> The judgment has since been reduced to $9.7 million, and the Krishnas may have to sell seven of their temples to pay if the decision is upheld by the California Supreme Court.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0188" num="24"> In an effort to explain the Krishna faith, which devotees believe has been maligned in the news media, the Laguna Beach temple set up informational displays under maroon-and-gold striped tents just south of the lifeguard station at Main Beach Park.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="9"> The state Supreme Court, acting in a bitter, 12-year battle over religious practices, on Thursday let stand an appellate ruling that sharply reduced a multimillion-dollar award against the Hare Krishnas and rejected charges that the group had "brainwashed" an Orange County girl when she was a teen-ager.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="10"> The justices refused to hear an appeal by Robin George and her mother contending that there was ample evidence that George had been deceived and coerced into leaving home and joining the group at age 14.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="11"> The Georges also sought to reinstate the original $32-million jury verdict against the Krishnas in 1983 that was reduced first by a trial judge to $9.7 million and then cut to $2.9 million last August by a state Court of Appeal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="12"> However, at the same time, the high court also refused to hear a separate appeal by the Hare Krishnas, arguing that even the reduced award should be overturned as a "gross and irreparable injustice" that undermined their constitutional right to freedom of religion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="13"> Thursday's action came in a brief order signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="14"> Lucas that, while leaving the appellate decision binding on the parties in the case, barred that ruling from being used as a precedent in other cases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="15"> Alan G. Martin of Beverly Hills, an attorney for the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, said there was "a pretty good chance" that the group will now ask the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="16"> Supreme Court to hear its contentions that the award violated First Amendment guarantees of religious liberty.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="17"> While pleased that the Georges' appeal was rejected, Martin expressed concern that even the reduced $2.9-million award would have "a very dramatic" adverse effect on the group's activities.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="19"> Niddrie of San Diego, an attorney for the Georges, expressed disappointment that the high court allowed the appellate decision to stand.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="20"> "The implication is that a prior member of these organizations cannot collect for false imprisonment and emotional distress," Niddrie said.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="21"> "I'm troubled that a 14-year-old girl was deemed to somehow have consented to what happened to her in this case.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="22">. . . The (reduced) award is insufficient in that it doesn't compensate Robin for what happened to her" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="23"> Robin George -- who is now married and goes by the name of Robin George Westerkamp -- also expressed mixed feelings about the ruling.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="24"> "I am certainly glad the award was not reduced further, but I don't think the court went far enough," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="25"> "The evidence we presented showed that without a doubt, I was completely brainwashed and the things that I did are not things I would do in my 'right' mind.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="26"> They (Krishnas) used their influence to manipulate people".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="27"> The woman, an interior designer who will say only -- out of fear of retribution from the Krishnas -- that she lives in northern Orange County, said she was disappointed that the case cannot be used as a legal precedent.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="28"> She contended that the Hare Krishnas prey on minors.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="29"> "The only way I came to my senses was that my parents were able to get me out of it and away long enough that I could think for myself again," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="30"> The suit was brought in 1977 by the family, claiming that the group had brainwashed the teen-ager into joining the movement and then conspired to conceal her from her parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="31"> The Georges said that in 1974, Robin George had begun braiding her hair and wearing a sari to school and had constructed a Hindu-style altar in her bedroom, arising each day at 2:30 a.m. to pray and chant.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="32"> Later, after her parents objected, the girl was told by a Krishna official that she must leave home and live in a temple if she were sincere about her belief, the suit alleged.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="33"> After leaving and spending most of a year in Krishna temples in New Orleans and Ottawa, Canada, Robin returned home.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="34"> Four months later, her father, James George, died of a heart attack that the suit claimed was brought about by stress over the affair.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="35"> After a five-month trial, an Orange County Superior Court jury upheld the family's wide-ranging legal claims and returned the $32-million award for compensatory and punitive damages that was subsequently reduced by Judge James A.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="36"> Jackman to $9.7 million.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="37"> In its ruling on Aug. 30, the state Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Appellate Justice Howard B.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="38"> Wiener, held that Robin George was not entitled to damages on the ground of false imprisonment.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="39"> The panel noted that the girl never claimed that she was physically restrained by the Krishnas and it rejected her argument that the group improperly employed "coercive persuasion" or "brainwashing" to force her to remain a member.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="40"> Those charges were invalid because they were aimed at Krishna practices -- such as diet restrictions, methods of worship and communal living arrangements -- that the family considered objectionable but that were protected by the First Amendment, the appeal court said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="41"> The three-member panel, however, found there was sufficient evidence to support an award of $2.9 million to Robin's mother, Marcia George.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="42"> The group was not protected by the Constitution for the emotional distress it caused in deceiving the parents by pretending not to know their daughter's whereabouts, the court held.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="43"> "Feigned ignorance was only one aspect of this reprehensible suffering," Wiener wrote.</s>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="44"> The Krishnas, by providing Robin George with plane and bus tickets and supplying a wig and glasses to help her disguise herself, engaged in "outrageous conduct" that amply supported the emotional distress claim by the mother, the court said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120189-0181" num="45"> In addition, the panel held that Robin George was entitled to $75,000 for her father's death.</s>
