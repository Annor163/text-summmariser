<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="9"> Anti-gang legislation permitting law enforcement officers to stop motorists at random and search their vehicles for illegal firearms during a local emergency was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate on Thursday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="10"> The bill by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), a former Los Angeles police chief, was sent to the Assembly on a lopsided 29-4 vote despite some reservations that the measure might run afoul of constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="11"> But Davis insisted that the bill, aimed at the perpetrators of gang-related drive-by shootings, provided for "reasonable search and seizure".</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="12"> He noted that "even some of our nicest suburbs are getting gang shootings and gang violence".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="13"> Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told the Senate that the far-reaching bill probably is unconstitutional and likely will be killed in the Assembly.</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="14"> Nevertheless, Lockyer had voted in favor of the measure in his committee and decided to sit out the vote on the Senate floor rather than publicly side against it during the current anti-crime climate that prevails among citizens.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="15"> "When you start in a free society searching people's cars without cause -- just doing it because you know there is a general safety problem -- we should all as free Americans worry about that," Lockyer cautioned his colleagues.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="16"> Skeptics noted that under the bill, police would not have to demonstrate the usually required probable cause or reasonable suspicion before stopping and searching a vehicle and seizing weapons.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="17"> One such skeptic, Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), voiced concern that police and sheriff's deputies could single out minority drivers for "discrimination".</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="18"> But Hart wound up voting for the measure.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="19"> But Davis said such conduct would be both improper and illegal.</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="20"> "I think police agencies are very sensitive to that," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="21"> The bill is intended to give cities and counties an additional tool to combat street gang shootings, particularly in some Los Angeles neighborhoods where gun fights between rival groups seem part of the life style.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="22"> The bill would allow a city council or county board of supervisors to declare that public safety is so "gravely imperiled" by illegal use of firearms that law enforcement officers should conduct emergency searches of vehicles at random.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="23"> The searches would be conducted only at night because, a Davis aide said, most drive-by shooting occur under cover of darkness.</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="24"> He also said daylight searches would unnecessarily disrupt people's lives</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="25"> The bill, in addition, would allow officers on a non-emergency basis to stop motorists at roadside checkpoints, similar to stops aimed at catching drunk drivers.</s>

<s docid="LA052689-0086" num="26"> At these stops, officers could not search the vehicle except to visually inspect the driver and passenger compartment for stolen, smuggled or other illegal weapons.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="8"> A white Long Beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a television crew acknowledged Friday that he made errors in his official report.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="9"> Officer Mark Dickey, speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 14 incident, told a state Senate oversight committee in sworn testimony that he had so little faith in his own report that he would not want it used against him if he were suspected of a crime.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="10"> He blamed the discrepancies on a faulty memory, saying he wrote the report more than three hours after the altercation occurred.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="11"> Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had indicated in his report.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="12"> Dickey also admitted that he intended to inflict pain on Jackson when he put handcuffs on him as a way to control him.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="13"> Police Misconduct Allegations</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="14"> Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices, called the hearing into the incident to review allegations of police misconduct in Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="15"> The legislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by the state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="16"> The incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in Jackson's car videotaped the arrest, during which Dickey swore at Jackson after stopping his car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push his head through a plate-glass window.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="17"> Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled crusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an NBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what he termed a "sting" operation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police officers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="18"> Investigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the Long Beach Police Department.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="19"> Dickey has been temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering with a police officer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="20"> At the hearing, Boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee members and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and Dickey and Jackson commented on each scene.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="21"> Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="22"> At one point, Boatwright asked Dickey: "You became the judge, jury and executioner as to whether he was challenged to a fight"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="23"> "No," Dickey tersely replied.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="24"> Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, refused to allow Dickey to answer any more questions after nearly three hours of questioning because of what he called the "hostile and badgering" nature of the inquiry.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="25"> "This little kangaroo court gives these politicians a chance to run for office.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="26"> Any resemblance between this and a fair hearing is just imaginary," Hannon told reporters afterward.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="27"> "They are taking stuff out of context and just badgering him with it".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="28"> Earlier, under questioning by Boatwright and as the videotape was played, Dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a tape shot from the NBC chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show Jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="29"> Boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a videotape shot from the Jackson car's rear window shows the street lights passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="30"> Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving "was weaving all over, too" as it tailed Jackson's car.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="31"> Jackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to break traffic laws when they cruised along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="32"> He alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushed his face into the hood of the police car.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="33"> Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to loosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the police station.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="34"> Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that Jackson was arrested for saying "offensive words," an allegation that was later dropped.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="35"> But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who uttered obscenities.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="36"> No Taunts Heard</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="37"> The report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although Jackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="38"> "There can be a fight without a verbal challenge," Dickey said, adding that Jackson's fists were clenched at his sides.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="39"> Dickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="40"> He testified that he thought Jackson, who immediately stepped out of the car after it came to a halt, might be trying to provide a diversion for an armed partner in the car.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="41"> He said his actions were an attempt to "accomplish my No. 1 job that night: to go home in one piece".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="42"> At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="43"> At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during the arrest.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="44"> Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="45"> Dickey denied it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="46"> The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson suddenly pulled forward.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="47"> Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with his elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="48"> Dickey, who cut his hand, noted that Jackson suffered no facial injuries when the glass shattered.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="49"> Jackson, in his testimony, defended his self-appointed role as a police anti-brutality activist, saying "my duty is to uphold the law and I am doing that in the highest tradition".</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="50"> He said he is troubled, though, that Long Beach police are investigating his background on the Hawthorne Police Department rather than concentrating on the incident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="51"> Boatwright adjourned the hearing, which was held at the Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles, after about six hours of testimony.</s>

<s docid="LA030489-0068" num="52"> He said it would reconvene later to hear from the additional witnesses.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="13"> It is presumed that there is a wide berth of believability between network television news and shows like Geraldo Rivera's assault on Al Capone's secret vault.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="18"> What we television viewers eventually saw was a confrontation between the police critic and a white officer who had stopped the car.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="19"> We saw the man get out of the car, agitated and complaining, and the officer responding; the audio was heavily censored, bleeping out the officer's use of obscenities.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="20"> Next the officer appeared to be pushing the man into a plate-glass store window.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="21"> We heard the man screaming over silhouetted images of him apparently being manhandled by the officer.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="28"> Police make traffic stops probably hundreds of times a day throughout metropolitan Los Angeles.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="29"> For most people who are stopped, it's a disquieting experience.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="30"> Most people do not jump out of their cars when stopped by police, and most certainly don't become confrontational.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="31"> That wasn't the case in Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="32"> The police critic had his own agenda.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="33"> He got out of the car -- another man stayed in the driver's seat -- walked toward the two officers and, in keeping with his script, refused to obey their commands.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="34"> This man, himself a police officer (now on a stress disability leave), knew from experience exactly how far to push the officers to evoke a dramatic response.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="35"> He played his role perfectly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="36"> Most police officers in this situation will be asking themselves: Why is the guy doing this?</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="43"> Next the videotape showed the storefront glass breaking.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="44"> The police critic maintains that his face was pushed into the window, yet when he was interviewed the next day, close-up on camera, there was no evidence of injury to his face.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="45"> The officer, however, cut his hand severely enough to require stitches.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="46"> What, or who, shattered the window?</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="47"> The full videotape may -- or may not -- answer that question.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="48"> The police critic's screaming voice was heard over murky pictures that supposedly showed the officer doing something to cause the man pain.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="49"> Actually the shadowy images, filmed from across the dark street, only dramatically imply mistreatment.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="50"> Unfortunately, NBC accepted it as factual.</s>

<s docid="LA012089-0035" num="51"> No, these pictures will need a lot more than a thousand words to explain, in an investigation that will dissect exactly what happened and how the officers handled it.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="15"> It is simply not true that people are taught to stay in the car, and every officer knows that there is no law requiring them to do so.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="16"> A well-trained officer should be able to retain his composure when confronted with nothing more than a person getting out of a car during a traffic stop and asking questions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="17"> Officers also know that the law specifically permits individuals to question, or even curse, representatives of the government.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="18"> This is the United States, not South Africa, and the First Amendment to the Constitution expressly provides for freedom of speech -- whether the speech is directed at a President, a governor, a postal employee or a police officer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="19"> The fact is that if Officer Dickey had intended to behave professionally, he would have resolved the matter without verbal abuse or physical violence.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="20"> His conduct cannot be justified by the "button-pushing" argument; if his buttons are that sensitive, he is unfit for patrol work.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="21"> Notwithstanding the fact that most police officers do a difficult job well, Don Jackson -- an officer himself -- was correct when he said that the incident was "consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force".</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="22"> The videotape is but one piece of evidence that there is indeed a pattern of violence in Southern California law enforcement, and that in the overwhelming majority of cases the victims are black or Latino.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="23"> Evidence of the pattern is also found in videotapes of Torrance officers choking and beating a young white man, of San Bernardino officers beating Latino men, and in the violence visited on black undercover officers by other LAPD officers, and on Ken Maddox, a former aide to the mayor.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="24"> Several police departments have requested copies of the Torrance videotape in order to train their officers in how not to behave.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="25"> But when police, confronted by public criticism, attempt to justify their use of violence, they only perpetuate it and undermine the professional standards that most law-enforcement officers observe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="26"> Racism and abuse of power were the salient features of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="27"> Gates' gang sweeps, in which 90% of the several thousand young black and Latino men arrested had committed no crime.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="28"> Then there is the Dalton Street incident of last August, probably the most publicized of the many instances of gratuitous violence by police in conducting residential searches.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="29"> (Reportedly, 18 LAPD officers face disciplinary proceedings for the destruction of the Dalton Street residences and the personal property of four black families).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="30"> The foregoing cases are the most notorious, but the pattern of violence also is reflected in the large volume of calls to the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="31"> Slightly more than 200 were received in December, requesting legal assistance in matters ranging from verbal abuse by police to false arrest to physical violence and death.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="32"> While not all of the calls turn out to involve police conduct that was improper, a frightening number do -- so many that the service is unable to find enough lawyers to share the caseload.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="33"> Among the reasons for the violence is the failure of government institutions to investigate the problem, to compile and disclose the evidence and to state unambiguously that unnecessary violence is unprofessional and intolerable.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="34"> Sharing in the responsibility are sheriffs and police chiefs who do not enforce regulations, prosecutors who are reluctant to prosecute police, local governments that are too timorous to exercise oversight, the state Legislature, which passed laws shielding complaints against police from public scrutiny, and courts that show extraordinary leniency in sentencing officers convicted of using excessive force and in granting them relief from discipline imposed by responsible tribunals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="35"> If, as some suggest, Don Jackson was provocative, it was only in provoking a public debate on an issue that has been ignored in most communities.</s>

<s docid="LA012789-0070" num="36"> Having now been exposed to what is virtually a daily event in minority neighborhoods in Southern California, the public should turn to local governments to correct the problem -- and should be as sassy as necessary.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="8"> The Long Beach Police Department is under fire these days as the result of a videotaped incident in which an officer cursed at and appeared to shove a man's face through a plate glass window for being black, wearing dirty clothes and occupying a 12-year-old car.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="9"> The matter is under investigation by everyone but the Presbyterian Church and I'm certain that eventually we will learn that the officer violated basic police procedure.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="10"> You never curse a suspect while shoving his face into a plate glass window.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="11"> We all know by now that the victim of the face-shoving incident was Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from another police department who was trying to show that police abuse of minorities is rampant in Long Beach, a premise he managed to illustrate with some degree of personal sacrifice.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="12"> I mean, plate glass windows aren't exactly plastic wrap.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="13"> You've got to use a little muscle to shove a head through one.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="14"> With Jackson that night was Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, who was driving the car.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="15"> Both men wore dirty clothes, which in itself is considered a misdemeanor in Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="16"> They were tooling along Pacific Coast Highway at a moderate rate of speed when they were pulled over by a patrol car containing Officers Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="17"> The entire incident was secretly videotaped by an NBC television crew as part of an activist group's sting operation looking for examples of police brutality.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="18"> The officers insisted later that they had stopped the car not because the men were black and wore dirty clothes but because the car was straddling lanes, a claim the television camera proved to be questionable, at best.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="19"> What happened thereafter was the cursing and the face-shoving by Officer Dickey, which was subsequentely aired nationwide by NBC.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="20"> This has created an outcry by bleeding hearts who feel the incident demonstrates the basest kind of police racism, but I buy the theory promulgated by Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, that at worst his client is guilty of discourtesy for cursing Jackson, an offense that deserves nothing more serious than a good finger-shaking and a stern naughty.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="21"> The attorney and others argue that Jackson set the whole thing up, deliberately goading Dickey into taking the action he took.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="22"> In the first place, they say, Jackson suspiciously got out of his car when it was stopped (in cop idiom he exited the vehicle), then demanded to know why the officer had stopped him in the first place.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="23"> I hadn't realized until now that either getting out of a car or asking why you were stopped constituted acts of aggression requiring a response just short of deadly force.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="24"> I was pulled over recently by a California Highway Patrol officer who claimed I was straddling lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="25"> When he stopped me, I exited my vehicle instantly because I've been told you have to move fast in order to talk a cop out of a ticket.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="26"> Once he begins writing the citation it's too late.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="27"> Fortunately for me, I'm not black, I don't drive an old car and I dress in a manner which, while not fashionable, isn't considered shabby.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="28"> I even made the mistake of asking the patrolman why he had stopped me which, in Long Beach, gets your face shoved into a plate glass window.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="29"> Fortunately, this was on a freeway and he would have had to drive me to the Santa Monica Mall in order to reach the nearest plate glass window.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="30"> As it turned out, he let me go with a warning not to straddle lanes and never again to wear a polka-dot tie with a plaid jacket.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="31"> Officer Dickey should, of course, be reprimanded for his abusive language and the Long Beach police manual ought to be revised to disallow shoving anyone's face into a plate glass window for simple traffic violations, except in cases where the suspect exits the vehicle and asks why he is being stopped, searched and cursed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="32"> The rest of us can do our part when in Long Beach by not being black if possible and, if not possible, by being neat and not sassing the officers and, above all, not exiting your vehicle unless dragged out by the throat.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="33"> A lot of plate glass windows will be saved that way.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="34"> If nothing else, I hope the incident points up the tensions that exist between minority groups and police and in the end creates a means by which the tensions can be eased.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0006" num="35"> Then we can get on to the serious business of a television series based on a white cop from one department who abuses a black cop from another department and in the end they turn out to be best friends who spend their lives fighting crimes committed by Mexicans, ole.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="9"> Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said the investigation involved employees "pretty high up" in the department, but he would not name them or say what actions are under review.</s>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="12"> One police officer who confirmed that he was interviewed by Norregard said he was asked whether Deputy Chief David Dusenbury was involved in any misconduct, including an incident three years ago in which Dusenbury allegedly hired as his secretary a woman with misdemeanor arrest record of prostitution and petty theft.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="13"> The officer, Jack O'Neil Jr., said he was asked similar questions in December by a deputy police chief who oversees the department's internal affairs section.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="14"> Dusenbury, who once headed the department's vice squad and had a reputation for being tough on prostitution, refused to comment.</s>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="16"> Binkley, who also said he could not to comment.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="17"> One former police official, retired Deputy Chief William Stovall, said Monday that he raised questions about Dusenbury's choice of a secretary with then-Chief Charles B.</s>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="18"> Ussery. Dusenbury told him he knew of the woman's criminal past and promised to fire her if she got in trouble again, Stovall said.</s>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="19"> But Stovall said he was worried because the woman had access to police computer records.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="20"> The secretary worked for the police force for only a month, Stovall said.</s>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="21"> He did not know why she left.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="22"> Before he retired in August, 1987, Stovall said, he also told the new Police Chief Binkley about the incident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA042589-0108" num="23"> The current investigation was disclosed recently in a memorandum to the city's 650 police officers.</s>

<s docid="LA040989-0049" num="11"> The proposals come in the wake of the January incident in which Officer Mark Dickey was secretly videotaped as he appeared to shove the head of black activist Don Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on administrative leave, through a plate-glass window.</s>

<s docid="LA040989-0049" num="12"> The commission has previously called for a citizen review board, but the City Council rejected the proposal.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="8"> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="9"> The Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to ask the district attorney's office to launch an independent investigation of the Saturday night incident, which was secretly recorded by an NBC television crew.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="10"> But Assistant Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="11"> Atty. Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into the case at the request of the Long Beach police chief.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="12"> "We agreed to review the matter to determine whether a criminal investigation is appropriate," Livesay said, adding that his office hopes to decide by Friday whether a full-fledged investigation is merited.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="13"> If such an inquiry reveals that brutality was involved, either misdemeanor or felony charges could be filed against the officer, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="14"> The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="15"> He refused to say who had requested the federal investigation.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="16"> "We've had an allegation of a civil rights violation and we opened a ticket on it this morning," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="17"> Jackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday night as the television crew followed behind in a van.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="20"> While edited portions of the tape have been broadcast, Long Beach officials have said they need to see everything filmed by the NBC crew to move ahead with their own investigation of the incident.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="21"> NBC officials have declined to release the full tape, saying that it would violate company policy to release unedited footage.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="29"> We will not tolerate this.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="30">. . . We need to find out what happened here and make sure it never happens again" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="31"> An investigation by the district attorney will add credibility to the city's own consideration of the brutality allegations, Kell said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="32"> It is not unusual for the district attorney to look into allegations of police brutality, Livesay said, estimating that the office takes on four to six such cases a year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="33"> In determining whether a police officer has used excessive force, prosecutors have to decide whether the officer acted "without lawful necessity" in assaulting or beating a suspect.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="34"> He declined to detail what would constitute unnecessary force, saying that it would be a "judgement call" by prosecutors based on the actions and statements of the police officers and suspects, and the injuries suffered.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="35"> Attorney Michael Hannon, who is representing the two officers, said Tuesday that he will contest any allegations of brutality.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="36"> He said the officers were "set up" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="38"> In a statement released a day after the incident, Long Beach police said that Jackson's and Hill's sedan was pulled over for weaving across the center line of the highway.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="39"> They denied that Jackson's head was shoved through the window, saying that his elbow smashed the glass.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="40"> On Monday, however, department officials stopped releasing that statement and said they would have no comment pending the outcome of their internal investigation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="41"> A spokesman for the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, a nonprofit group that investigates citizen complaints against law enforcement agencies, said the televised tape makes it clear that Dickey pushed Jackson's head and right arm through the window.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="42"> Spokesman David Lynn maintained that Hill, the driver of the car, was not violating any traffic laws when he was stopped.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="43"> The group also complained that Dickey also used a string of obscenities in his conversation with Jackson, who was booked for suspicion of using offensive language, challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="44"> He was released on his own recognizance pending a Jan. 25 court appearance.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="45"> Clarence Smith, the only black member of the Long Beach City Council, said he found the tape "shocking".</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="46"> But other city officials argued that the television footage was not necessarily conclusive because it showed the altercation from only one angle and showed Jackson and Dickey only from the waist up.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="47"> "It's real hard to tell what's happening below the waist," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, maintaining that it is vital that NBC release the rest of its videotapes.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="49"> Attorney Hannon conceded that Dickey was wrong to spice his orders to Jackson with obscenities, but he said the cursing was evidence of discourtesy, rather than racism.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="50"> He said the two officers saw the car weave within the traffic lane and wanted to check the driver for drunkenness.</s>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="51"> Although the two men in the car were black, driving an old car and dressed in shabby clothes, they were not stopped for those reasons, the lawyer said, adding that they were in a section of the city where their appearance was not unusual.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="52"> "Obviously, they are not telling the truth when they say they did nothing to bring attention to themselves," Hannon said of Jackson and Hill.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011889-0067" num="53"> He said the two police officers become concerned for their safety when Jackson suspiciously exited the car as soon as it stopped, then immediately started arguing when Dickey ordered him to submit to a search for weapons.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="7"> If the altercation last Saturday night between two black activists and two white Long Beach police officers had run true to form, it would have attracted little attention and would have produced what the experts call a "swearing match".</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="8"> The cops, under oath, would have sworn that they pulled over the activists' car because it was weaving down Pacific Coast Highway and that one of the men threatened them and, while they were restraining him, smashed the plate-glass window of a hardware store with his elbow.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="9"> The activists would have sworn that they had broken no traffic law and that, once pulled over, they were subjected to a torrent of profanity and excessive physical force that ended with the arresting officer's pushing one of them through the plate-glass window.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="10"> More likely than not, a trial court would have accepted the police version.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="11"> What changed this scenario, of course, was the videotape that NBC made of the whole incident with a hidden camera and a microphone.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="12"> The edited tape, played and replayed in the last few days, strongly suggests that the version of events related by activists Don Jackson and Jeff Hill, both off-duty law-enforcement officers themselves, is closer to the truth than what the Long Beach policemen told their superiors in their formal report.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="13"> The car was not weaving down the highway; the expletives came not from Jackson, who was booked for -- among other things -- suspicion of using offensive language, but from Officer Mark Dickey; it was Dickey who shoved Jackson's head and arm through the window, then lied about it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="14"> Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police Department, has been criticized in some quarters for setting up this sting and for purposefully provoking an overreaction from the arresting officers by getting out of the car.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="15"> Perhaps he was sassier than most citizens would consider prudent.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="16"> But, whether or not the current investigations find that he was provocative, Jackson should be credited with turning the spotlight on a longstanding unresolved dispute that embroils many cities: Do predominantly white police departments routinely detain blacks without cause, harass them and use excessive force?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="17"> Jackson and Hill, leaders of the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, an organization dedicated to exposing racial discrimination in law-enforcement agencies, insist that the videotape proves their point.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="18"> The roust on Pacific Coast Highway was "consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force" by the Long Beach force, says Jackson, citing dozens of citizen complaints from Long Beach blacks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="19"> Maybe he is right; certainly many blacks share his perception, sometimes reinforced by personal experience, of racism among the police.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="20"> But the videotape doesn't tell the whole tale.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="21"> It doesn't explain why the Long Beach officers stopped that car last Saturday night, it doesn't prove whether Officer Dickey genuinely felt menaced by Jackson, it doesn't determine whether there was "lawful necessity" for the force that Dickey used, and it emphatically does not establish a pattern of racism in Long Beach or anywhere else.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="22"> Those are all issues, particularly the question of whether it was an isolated incident or part of a pattern, that should be investigated by the Los Angeles district attorney's office and the FBI.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="23"> We would urge that all parties cooperate with these inquiries -- including NBC, which so far has balked at releasing a full, unedited videotape.</s>

<s docid="LA011989-0012" num="24"> That is the only way, as Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said so forcefully Tuesday, "to find out what happened here and make sure it never happens again".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="17"> It was being carried on a butane gas tank truck, which was intercepted at Km 54+56 of the Saltillo-Concepcion del Oro highway.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="18"> The announcement was made today by that force's commander, Juan Carlos Alvarado.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="19"> He reported that the tank truck carrying the drugs was of the Tacsa make, bearing the initials HGS (Horacio Gonzalez Serna).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="20"> Arrested on the scene of the incident were Raul Juarez Paz, aged 37, and Miguel Angel Salazar Ramirez, 25, both natives of Uruapan, Michoacan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="22"> He noted that the tank truck was detected because it was being driven at excessive speed on the aforementioned route, prompting the agents to order it stopped, so as to search its interior.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-21286" num="23"> He remarked that, while this action was being taken, the tank truck's occupants appeared nervous and, when its load was inspected, the drugs were found contained in 2,162 packages, distributed in 168 bags.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="8"> Admitting the case was weak, the Long Beach city prosecutor Wednesday dropped charges that Don Jackson, a self-styled crusader against police brutality, resisted arrest during a secretly filmed "sting" in which a police officer appeared to shove Jackson's head through a plate glass window.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="9"> Long Beach Municipal Judge Gary R.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="10"> Hahn quickly agreed to the prosecutor's request for dismissal of the case against Jackson, who in turn claimed vindication of his efforts to expose police brutality.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="11"> Videotaped by a hidden NBC television crew and later broadcast on the "Today" show, Jackson's Jan. 14 encounter with two Long Beach police officers focused national attention on allegations that the city's police force routinely mistreats minority members.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="12"> The case drew the interest of black community leaders, entertainment celebrities and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who rallied to Don Jackson's side, donating money for his legal defense and lauding him as a hero.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="13"> "I'm very elated," Don Jackson said outside the courtroom, where his trial on the misdemeanor charges was scheduled to start Wednesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="14"> He later said he is considering suing Long Beach and the Police Department over his arrest and prosecution and will seek a formal censure of the city prosecutor.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="15"> "I think it's shocking they even took the case this far.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="16">. . . I'm requesting that my attorney seek some form of ethical sanction against the lead attorney for this malicious prosecution," said Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="17"> John A.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="18"> Vander Lans, the city prosecutor, said he never would have filed charges against Jackson in January if he had all the information he now has.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="19"> "The facts we had after the 20th of March changed my mind," said Vander Lans, who declined to specify exactly what had prompted him to seek the case's dismissal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="20"> However, he said it was not until last Friday that he had received all tapes of the incident from NBC, and it was not until Monday that he received an official transcript of a state Senate oversight committee hearing on the matter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="21"> Both Jackson and Mark Dickey -- the officer who appears to push Jackson into the window on the tape -- testified at that hearing, and Dickey admitted he had filed an inaccurate report on the arrest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="22"> Normally, Vander Lans said, his office would file a misdemeanor charge the day after the arrest.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="23"> But in Jackson's case, he waited several more days, until "we thought we had all the facts".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="24"> The videotaped arrest occurred late on a Saturday night, when Jackson and an off-duty corrections officer donned dirty old clothes and drove into Long Beach with a television crew following discreetly at a distance.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="25"> Their mission was to demonstrate police abuse and capture it on film.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="26"> Dickey and his partner pulled Jackson over, allegedly for a traffic violation.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="27"> Moments later, as the cameras rolled, Dickey cursed Jackson and appeared to push him into a shop window, shattering the glass.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="28"> Dickey, saying Jackson had used profanity and been belligerent, arrested Jackson on a charge of interfering with a police officer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="29"> It was not Jackson's first self-styled sting, nor, apparently will it be his last.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="30"> Despite his career in law enforcement, he has stopped hundreds of times to watch police make arrests and sometimes used himself as bait.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="31"> In Westwood last year, he was arrested after allegedly blocking a sidewalk, but the prosecutor for that community never filed charges against him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="32"> Jackson, who has filed a lawsuit accusing the Hawthorne Police Department of racial discrimination, said Wednesday he will renew his sting efforts after a brief respite.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="33"> He added that he intends to establish a foundation to monitor civil rights abuses by any government agencies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="34"> After Wednesday's dismissal, Jackson's attorneys insisted that Vander Lans never had grounds to file charges against their client.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="35"> They claimed the prosecutor had pressed the case in an attempt to fend off a possible lawsuit by Jackson.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="36"> "The case was filed maliciously," insisted Thomas E.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="37"> Beck, one of Jackson's attorneys.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="38"> Beck attributed Vander Lans' abrupt about-face to Dickey's Senate testimony, in which the officer admitted that Jackson had never sworn at him, as he stated in his police report.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="39"> Dickey, who attributed the errors in his report to a faulty memory, said he had so little faith in his own police report that he would not want it used against him if he were suspected of a crime.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="40"> Dickey, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, has been reassigned from patrol duty to desk duties pending the outcome of the Long Beach Police Department's internal investigation of the incident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="41"> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI also launched their own investigations of the officers' conduct, and spokesmen for all three agencies Wednesday said the investigations will continue, unaffected by the prosecutor's decision to drop the case against Jackson.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="44"> Binkley both said they expect their investigations to be completed within the next couple of weeks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="45"> Binkley, while complaining that Vander Lans had not informed him that he planned to dismiss the case, said he could not comment on the prosecutor's decision.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="46"> "There's very little I can say about the actions of the elected official," Binkley said, referring to Vander Lans, who has been reelected to the prosecutor's post several times since first winning the position in 1978.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="47"> A spokesman for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. was freer with his opinion of the case's dismissal.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="48"> "This has been a real big slap in the face, not just to police in Long Beach, but all over the state and throughout the country," complained association spokesman Mike Minton.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="49"> As a result, he continued, "The Don Jacksons of the world are going to go out there and try to intimidate police officers, and somebody is going to get hurt".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="50"> Long Beach officials seemed relieved that the case was over, questioning whether Vander Lans ever should have pursued it in the first place.</s>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="51"> "I kind of felt he had a weak case to begin with, but thought maybe he knew something I didn't know," Mayor Ernie Kell said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="52"> Called Isolated Incident</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="53"> Kell, noting that the publicity surrounding the case was not the kind the city wanted, termed the Jackson-Dickey episode "an isolated incident, an unfortunate incident".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="54"> Larry Davis, chairman of a city commission that advises the City Council on public safety issues, called the dismissal "a good sign" that the community was prepared to deal with the brutality allegations raised by Jackson and others.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA032389-0089" num="55"> "I think any reasonable citizen in this town on Jan. 16 could have reached the same decision it took (the prosecutor's office) 60 days to reach," Davis added.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="8"> Two Long Beach police officers who were caught in the widely publicized sting involving civil rights activist Don Jackson have received stress-related disability retirements that will pay them 50% of their salaries for life, city officials said Tuesday.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="9"> Officers Mark Dickey, 29, and Mark Ramsey, 28, are suffering from psychological problems stemming from their arrest of Jackson on Jan. 14, 1989, according to city officials.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="10"> Doctors representing the officers and physicians with the city Health Department agreed that Dickey and Ramsey can no longer do their jobs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="11"> Others, however, were shocked to hear of the retirement pay.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="12"> "It's outrageous," Jackson exclaimed when told of the retirements.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="13"> "These guys were stressed out because they were engaged in misconduct and they got caught".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="14"> In January, 1989, Jackson set out to show that racism existed in the Long Beach Police Department.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="15"> While an NBC camera crew tagged along, Jackson drove through Long Beach and eventually was stopped by Dickey and Ramsey for an alleged traffic violation.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="16"> In the videotaped encounter, Dickey appeared to push Jackson's head through a glass window, shattering it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="17"> Dickey was charged with misdemeanor assault.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="18"> He and Ramsey were also charged with misdemeanor violations for allegedly lying about the incident in a police report.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="19"> A trial is set for Jan. 17.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="20"> Two months after the Jackson incident, Dickey went out on disability.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="21"> Ramsey followed in April.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="22"> In separate workers compensation claims, both cited anxiety and gastrointestinal problems among their illnesses.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="23"> The claims said the illnesses were stress induced and began after January, 1989.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="24"> Those claims are pending.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="25"> Doctors from the city's Health Department said that the officers' "primary disabling condition is psychological," according to a report the city filed with the Public Employees Retirement System, which will pay the officers their lifetime disability.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="26"> Officials declined to elaborate on the officers' medical problems, citing confidentiality.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="27"> The officers are free to work other jobs and still receive their disability pay.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="28"> At the time he left the department, Dickey earned $756.92 a week and Ramsey was earning $663.24 a week.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="29"> Dickey joined the department in October, 1984, and Ramsey joined in April, 1987.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="30"> "Disability retirements for police officers and firefighters are not unusual.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="31"> They happen ever year," said William Storey, the city's personnel director.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="32"> Since 1979, Long Beach has averaged between 10 and 12 disability retirements for officers annually, Storey said.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="33"> Officials could not say how many of those were stress related.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="34"> In this case, all the doctors who examined the officers concurred that they could not do their jobs, according to Barbara de Jong, the deputy city attorney in charge of worker's compensation claims.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="35"> The city did not dispute the officers' claims because the city's Health Department doctors agreed with the officers' doctors, officials explained.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="36"> "We make valid medical recommendations," Storey said.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="37"> "That affects what we put in the Public Employees Retirement System.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="38"> If we were to let everybody go off on medical disability, we'd be paying a heck of a lot of money.</s>

<s docid="LA112890-0089" num="39"> Obviously, we don't want to do that".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="20"> The police and the Customs Office together confiscated on 62 occasions 427 kgs of heroin, 253 kgs of hashish (a quarter of a ton of this was found in a truck in one consignment), 10 kgs of marijuana, and 3 kgs of cocaine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="21"> Officers of the Customs and Excise Office confiscated a significant amount of drugs on 35 occasions, significant amount meaning drugs equivalent to 20 grams of heroin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="22"> Drugs were found in railway carriages 13 times, six times in trucks, seven times in cars, four times in hiding places in buses, and five times in airports hidden in various parcels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="28"> One-third of all the confiscated drugs were found by the customs officers on the basis of police information, police experts claim.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="29"> However, the customs officers say that they would be able to discover much more drugs if their work was assisted by modern screening equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="30"> From U.S. aid, Bulgarian customs officers started to use such equipment at their Turkish border, and their efficiency has multiplied since then.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60044" num="31"> The police caught significant amounts of drugs inside the country on 27 occasions--20 times in Budapest--in 1993.</s>
