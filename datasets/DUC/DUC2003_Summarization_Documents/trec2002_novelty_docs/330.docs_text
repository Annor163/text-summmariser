<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="13"> It was the second gesture President Saddam Hussein has made to Iran in less than a month.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="14"> In mid-August, he announced the withdrawal of Iraqi troops that had occupied a section of Iran after the 8-year Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988 and renounced his claim to disputed territory at the head of the Persian Gulf.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="15"> Also Monday, Hussein offered to supply oil free of charge to Third World countries suffering from higher prices brought on by the Mideast crisis.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="16"> In a televised speech read as usual by a network announcer, Hussein said: "We announce today that we are still your brother and share with you the same destiny.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="17"> Therefore, we declare now that we are prepared to supply you with Iraqi oil free of charge".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="18"> He said that anyone who wants the oil, "under the assumption" that such a gift is not forbidden by U.N. sanctions, should simply apply for it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="19"> "We are prompted by a principled and moral commitment to ease some of your burden and to demonstrate solidarity with you," Hussein said.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="20"> "Such a decision is not related to, and shall not be affected by, any of your decisions and attitudes toward the current crisis".</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="21"> With oil revenues cut off, along with imports of food, medicine, spare parts and machinery, the blockade is taking a toll on Iraq, but analysts say the country has not yet begun to buckle under the strain.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="22"> Iran and Iraq share a long border, and if Iran decided to ignore the sanctions, the blockade could collapse.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="23"> The announcement on the restoration of ties came at the end of a two-day visit to Tehran by Iraq's Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="24"> He was shown on television here speaking cheerfully with Iranian officials.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="25"> The announcement seemed to suggest that Iraq wants more than just formal diplomatic ties.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="26"> Western diplomats noted that the quest for "natural" relations implies trade links as well.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="27"> The Iran-Iraq War ended two years ago in a cease-fire brokered by the United Nations, and when Iraq formally sued for peace last month, it was seen as an effort to free troops for use against the multinational force being assembled on the Arabian peninsula.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="28"> In the months since the war, neither Iran nor Iraq had shown so much as a glimmer of trust until last spring, when Hussein raised the possibility of a summit peace conference.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="29"> The key point of dispute was the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that forms the two nations' southern border.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="30"> Control of the waterway, the gulf outlet of the Iraqi port of Basra, was a prime strategic target for Baghdad's troops when they poured into Iran in September, 1980.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="31"> Five years earlier, the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, then the power in the gulf, had forced upon Iraq an agreement to share the Shatt al Arab straight down the middle.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="32"> Two weeks after the invasion of Kuwait, faced with the first elements of what has become a massive Western military buildup in the gulf region, Hussein called for an exchange of prisoners of war, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and a 50-50 division of the Shatt al Arab.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="33"> "Everything you wanted. . . has been realized," he said in a letter to Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="34"> Although Hussein's propaganda organs announced that peace on the Iranian border would permit the military to move 30 divisions, more than 300,000 men, to the southern front "for the great duel" over Kuwait, intelligence reports indicate that fewer than five of the divisions have shown any sign of moving.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="35"> Now, with the blockade proving effective, Hussein is believed to be looking to Iran as a way of circumventing the blockade and bringing in supplies.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="36"> Large shipments of food would be sighted easily in sparsely populated Jordan, but Iran has a population of more than 50 million, and increased supplies could be brought into Iranian ports without seeming unusual.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="37"> Two days before Aziz arrived in Baghdad, the English-language Tehran Times openly suggested that "humanitarian shipments" might be passed through to Iraq.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="38"> Ever since U.N. trade sanctions were imposed last month, Hussein has been probing for potential soft spots with a series of public relations gestures.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="39"> To Arab nationalists, he has portrayed his cause as a battle against Westerners out to subjugate the Arab world.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="40"> To Muslims, he has depicted himself as a defender of holy shrines in Saudi Arabia.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="41"> Addressing his former arms supplier, the Soviet Union, he has called for a return to the days when Moscow and Washington battled by proxy in Third World conflicts.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="42"> These appeals have failed to have any effect on the noose being tightened around Iraq, and now Hussein is waving a seductive card at the Third World, particularly at debtor countries hard hit by rising oil prices.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="43"> Striking an us-against-them note, Hussein accused the Western powers of forgetting the poor countries' troubles in their frenzy to turn back Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="44"> "It should not come as a surprise to you, brothers, when the big and developed countries do not show much concern for your issues," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="45"> The United States and its allies, he said, "did not ask, nor did they provide an answer to the harm they would bring to the Third World countries.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="46"> While oil monopolies are still drawing filthy profits from this crisis, they let Third World countries muddle into their crises".</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="47"> Whether anyone takes Hussein up on the offer may be beside the point, analysts believe.</s>

<s docid="LA091190-0051" num="48"> They say he is trying to win sympathy in the underdeveloped countries on the basis of their needs and his apparent generosity.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="15"> [Text] Tehran, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Iraq, the former foe of Iran during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, has postponed the visit by an Iranian delegation to Baghdad for two weeks or maybe longer, a high-ranking Iranian official disclosed here today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="16"> "As our delegation is leaving for Baghdad, the Iraqi side sent a telex message, asking for a 2-week postponement of the visit," Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki told XINHUA: Therefore, the Iranian delegation has been still in the country and the planned trip by foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati has also been postponed, he added.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="17"> Nevertheless, he did not give any detail about the cause of the postponement by the Iraqi side, adding that he was still optimistic over the relations between Iran and Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="18"> However, observers here noted that the postponement would cast a shadow on the improving relations of the two former foes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="19"> It also indicated that the two sides have had big differences on some major issues.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="20"> They also doubted the prospect of the bilateral relations because many problems still remain unsolved, such as the fate of prisoners of the eight-year war between the two countries, war compensation, Iraqi aircraft in Iran and support of each side's opposition forces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="21"> The future talks will no doubt be focused on removing the obstacles of the improving relations, rather than rapid normalization of ties, which cannot be foreseen in the immediate future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="22"> The two sides will have a lot of important issues to discuss, including the trade.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="23"> Once the UN sanctions against Iraq lifted, Iran can be a major supplier of goods to Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="24"> However, Iranian dailies acknowledged that Tehran's mistrust and lack of faith in the Baghdad regime is not without reason.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="25"> Baghdad has been supporting the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) to launch cross border attacks from inside Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="26"> The Iranian delegation was formerly scheduled for Iraq on June 11 to make preparation for Velayati's visit to Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="27"> According to official report, Velayati was preparing the trip to Iraq to discuss bilateral ties and other issues, including the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from both countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="28"> If the Iranian foreign minister makes the trip, it would be the first visit by Velayati to Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="29"> The POW issue is the main obstacle for an improvement of ties between the two countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="30"> According to an official report, Iraq is still holding 8,000 Iranian military personnel and civilians, including soldiers captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-26164" num="31"> But Iraq has denied holding any Iranian citizens and claims 20,000 of its own troops are being held in Iran.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="6"> SADDAM Hussein has changed from a president into a wolf in the Iranian lexicon.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="7"> The restrained politeness accorded to the Iraqi leader last year by Iran after he capitulated to Iran's main demands to end the Iran-Iraq war has been all but abandoned, signalling a return to the friction that traditionally characterises relations between the two.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="8"> The careful neutrality that Iran nurtured while the American-led coalition was bombing Iraq has turned into scantily-veiled calls for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="9"> Last month, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on the Iraqi leadership to 'submit to the will of the people'.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="10"> Tehran has diverted its attention from calls on the multinational forces to withdraw and allow countries of the regions to solve their own problems, to increasingly identifying President Saddam as the root of these problems.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="11"> Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has called Saddam an incompetent ruler who brought ruin upon himself and his country through his Kuwait adventure, while Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary, has said that Saddam must be tried as a war criminal.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="12"> The shift is a measure of the success of Mr Saddam Hussein's internal security forces in crushing internal unrest, staged mostly by the discontented Shia population in the south and the Sunni Kurds in the north.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="13"> Iran was careful not to appear too supportive of the Iraqi opposition coalition - which includes the Shia groups - at the beginning of the uprising, but has been sorely disappointed that the chance to remove Mr Saddam is rapidly fading.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="14"> For its part, unnerved by the revolts and anxious to blame them on a foreign enemy, Iraq has abandoned its own caution towards Iran, accusing it of fomenting trouble in the south by sending in saboteurs across the border - charges which Iran denies.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="15"> However, Iran's news agency has been giving extensive coverage to the disturbances in Iraq, reporting successes which Baghdad claims are exaggerated.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="16"> A new radio station, the Voice of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, began broadcasting material hostile to President Saddam, from its base in Iran less than four weeks ago.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="17"> Tehran is also home to the main Shia opposition group, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="18"> Both countries have accused the other of violating the 1988 ceasefire agreement.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="19"> In a move ominously reminiscent of the situation before Iraqi troops invaded Iran in September 1980, Iraq sent a letter of protest to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary general, on Sunday, listing Iranian attacks on Iraqi positions on its side of the border.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="20"> Iran has also firmly ruled out a return of Iraqi aircraft which flew to Iran during the height of US military operations.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="21"> This week, Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, denied that Iran was holding 148 aircraft as Iraq maintained and said it only had 22 - a claim that has mystified Western military analysts, who also support the higher figure.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="22"> Mr Hassan Ebrahim Habibi, the Iranian first vice-president, denied last month that Iran was considering holding on to the aircraft as war reparations.</s>

<s docid="FT911-4360" num="23"> 'The damage inflicted on Iran during the eight-year war is so huge that a few second-hand and wrecked planes cannot compensate even one thousandth of it,' he said.</s>

<s docid="LA091390-0082" num="18"> The approach seems contradictory, however: In succession, Iran has condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded a withdrawal; accepted President Saddam Hussein's offer of peace and restoration of diplomatic relations, and voiced alarm over the buildup of Western military forces in the gulf.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="7"> ISRAEL, for years a discreet partner with Iran against Arab powers, has begun to voice concern over Tehran's military ambitions, saying it is in the early stages of developing a domestic nuclear weapons programme similar to that pursued by Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="8"> This week, the defence establishment has alleged publicly that unspecified German and other European companies, some of whom previously co-operated with Iraqi non-conventional arms projects, were now working in Iran.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="9"> 'Israel will not remain inactive on the subject of German and European aid to Iran in the development of nuclear and chemical weapons and will not remain indifferent to the active threat of an extreme and unpredictable regime,' Mr Eliyahu Ben Elisar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee, told Ha'aretz newspaper.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="10"> In the past, notably during the reign of the late Shah, Israel itself traded oil, arms, equipment and technological know-how with Iran, which it cultivated as an important regional counterweight to Arab states.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="11"> Contacts survived the Shah's overthrow, despite the advent of the virulently anti-Israeli Khomeini regime, and Israel continued to supply arms during the Iran-Iraq war.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="12"> In late 1989, the US confirmed Israel had bought oil from Iran in a deal linked to efforts to win the freedom of Israeli servicemen held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="13"> Now, however, with those efforts still frustrated, officials say they are worried by Iranian ambitions to become a dominant regional power, filling the vacuum left by Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War a year ago.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="14"> Their concern has been heightened by Iran's opposition to Middle East peace talks, which most Arab states have accepted, and its efforts to forge ties with Islamic former Soviet Asian republics.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="15"> In off-the-record briefings, military sources have said Tehran is in the early stages of a nuclear programme which, if successful, could produce an 'Islamic bomb' by the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="16"> They say it is modelled on the Iraqi efforts to acquire foreign technology.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="17"> They say Iran is seeking co-operation with China and Pakistan, having ordered a small reactor and acquired a 'calutron' isotope isolation device from Beijing for research purposes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="18"> It is also trying to buy a 5-10 megawatt reactor from India.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="19"> The sources say Israel has no evidence that Soviet nuclear scientists have been brought to Iran, as some reports have suggested.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="20"> But they say links have been made with European companies -which they did not name - for the supply of equipment with nuclear uses.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="21"> Israel is also worried by Iran's conventional forces.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="22"> The sources say Tehran acquired 'several dozen' 500km-range, Scud-C ballistic missiles from North Korea last year to add to its shorter-range Scud-B rockets, and has plans to acquire longer-range missiles.</s>

<s docid="FT921-12078" num="23"> Iran, the sources say, has shown no sign of giving back more than 100 Iraqi jets whose pilots flew them across the border during the Gulf War.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="7"> Mr Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei, the Iraqi foreign minister, said yesterday in a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that 'the decisions taken by the Iraq-Kuwait border demarcation commission are illegitimate and constitute a dangerous precedent in the history of the international organisation'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="8"> The findings by the commission, which have yet to be ratified by the Security Council, recommend returning to Kuwait the land at Umm Qasr on which Iraq has during the past 20 years built a naval base.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="11"> Iraq accused Kuwait of illegally taking oil from the field shortly before its invasion in August 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="12"> At both Umm Qasr and Rumailah the UN commission found that Iraq had since 1963 encroached on what was Kuwaiti territory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="13"> Had Kuwait chosen to press its case more strongly for a further portion of the Umm Qasr port it is likely that the commission would have found in its favour.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="14"> Iraq's limited access to the sea has been a cause of repeated conflict with its neighbours.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="15"> In September 1980 it abrogated the 1975 Algiers agreement with Iran on the joint use of the Shatt al-Arab waterway just before launching its eight-year war with Tehran.</s>

<s docid="FT922-5202" num="16"> Iraq's warning to the UN yesterday indicates how the commission's findings on the border with Kuwait will be used by President Saddam Hussein as a nationalist rallying point and as a further example of his contention that his country's troubles are primarily the responsibility of the western powers.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="9"> The former combat tank driver seemed out of place selling bras and panties in an indoor bazaar.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="10"> He was slightly more drawn than when he left for war six years ago, friends said, but he was still brawny enough to haul big sacks of clothing as if they were weightless, and his thick hands made the flimsy wares he sold look like dolls' clothing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="11"> He was content, he said, haggling over prices with his customers and patiently tugging at elastic bands to show off the quality.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="12"> "After prison in Iran, this is a kind of peace," he told a visitor.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="14"> Ali -- not his real name -- came home to Baghdad in mid-August, a freed prisoner of war.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="15"> After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the government of Saddam Hussein made a quick peace with its archenemy Iran and brought to a full close an eight-year war that had been suspended by a cease-fire in 1988.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="16"> The peace -- Iraq withdrew from Iranian territory it had fought long and hard to hold -- made it possible for Hussein to reduce the military threat from the east and concentrate his forces on the defense of annexed Kuwait.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="17"> An exchange of thousands of prisoners from each side was part of the deal, and the homecomings have brought joy in hard times to families throughout Iraq.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="18"> But in a perverse way, the return of haggard men from war is also a reminder of the pain of the long conflict and a caution about the future.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="19"> The subject is apparently sensitive enough that no account of life in captivity from a returning POW has been published in Iraqi newspapers or broadcast on the airwaves.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="20"> Iraqis appear to be tired of war.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="21"> Even as many express agreement that Kuwait is part of Iraq, visions of more dead, more wounded and more captured only two years after the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq bloodshed has tempered enthusiasm for the new conquest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="22"> It is a dangerous issue to bring up, especially in a crowded market where ears are tuned not only to pick up the chant of bargain prices but also the murmur of dissenting voices.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="23"> "I have seen many things," said Ali as he was pressed for an opinion on the wisdom of fighting for Kuwait.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="24"> "Lots of things".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="25"> Ali was captured in 1986 during the bloody struggle over Al Faw, an Iraqi port on a spit of land at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab, the confluence of Iraq's main rivers at the head of the Persian Gulf.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="26"> For 42 days, Iran poured artillery fire onto the town, ravaged the marshy landscape, eventually crossed the river and took the devastated peninsula.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="27"> Iraq would recapture it two years later.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="28"> From 1980 to 1988, more than 50,000 Iraqis and 120,000 Iranians died in the battles over Al Faw, the Iraqi government says.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="29"> In official parlance, Al Faw is now called the City of Sacrifice and Gateway for Great Victory.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="30"> "I was surrounded," Ali tersely recalled his capture under fire.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="31"> "We had to surrender".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="32"> His capture began a difficult odyssey.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="33"> He spent two weeks on a truck crammed with other prisoners traversing the rough terrain of Iran before being taken to a prisoner of war camp called El Khark.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="34"> Later he was transferred to a camp called El Haswatiyah, and finally to a stockade in Tehran.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="35"> In detention, he was sometimes jammed into a room with 20 prisoners, sometimes only four.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="36"> Bread was the mainstay of the diet, and meat was served three or four times a week.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="37"> Letters from home came infrequently, sometimes months, even a year, after they were sent.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="38"> "I prayed a lot," Ali said as he held up a pink Slim Line panty for a veiled customer.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="39"> "Praying is one thing we were allowed to do".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="40"> Ali is a devout Shiite Muslim, and Shiite-ruled Iran pinned part of its hopes of defeating Iraq on getting enemy Shiites to rebel against the secular rule of Hussein.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="41"> In prison, Iranian wardens preached the virtues of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and handed out literature extolling his rule and desire for peace.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="42"> "I don't think he wanted peace so much," Ali remarked dryly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="43"> The pro-Khomeini lectures were complemented by anti-Hussein harangues.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="44"> A prisoner who declared himself opposed to the Baghdad regime would be given more reading materials and favors, such as occasional excursions outside the prison walls.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="45"> Intrigue blackened the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="46"> Guards asked prisoners to inform on their comrades: Who was pro-Hussein, who not?</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="47"> Little bits of information might be rewarded by the sudden arrival of a letter from home or trips to a mosque or, for Christians, to a church.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="48"> Visits from the Red Cross or the Red Crescent Society, the Islamic relief organization, were times of intense if hypocritical activity.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="49"> New bed coverings were brought in and rations were increased.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="50"> Prisoners were ordered to clean their cells.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="51"> When the visitors left, the old, ragged blankets were returned.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="52"> Occasionally an Iranian official would come to inspect, and the clean-up chores began again.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="53"> "If we didn't make things spotless, the guards would beat us," Ali said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="54"> Labor -- tasks like weaving rugs or construction and repair of buildings -- was encouraged.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="55"> The pay was minimal, enough to buy a pack of cigarettes or soap.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="56"> Everyone aged rapidly.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="57"> Ali lost seven front teeth and began to walk with a stoop though he was not yet 30 years old.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="58"> Then, in early August, word came over the prison radio that Iran and Iraq had made peace.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="59"> Iran trumpeted a great victory; Iraqi troops were pulling back.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="60"> Ali was among the first to be bused to the border and then into Iraq, to Baghdad, where each night on television the freed prisoners were shown stepping into the sunlight, sometimes raising a clenched fist, but more often impassively carrying a little bag of belongings as they rushed off screen past a large portrait of Hussein.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="61"> Ali, now 31, was greeted by relatives with a modest feast of lamb and rice and a gift of false teeth.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="62"> He has fattened up quite a bit since returning home and now walks erect.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="63"> A cousin set him up in the underwear business and he rented space in the bazaar.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="64"> From the government, he gets 97 Iraqi dinars a month pension; by the official exchange rate, that is almost $300, but on the black market, it is less than $20.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="65"> Rental for a small apartment is about 200 dinars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="66"> "Now, I work like everyone else," said Ali.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="67"> The family arranged an engagement to a young woman of 21, a distant relative in his large clan.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="68"> Perhaps in four months, they will be married.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="69"> The other day, as Ali delicately arranged a display of mascara and face cream, new items for sale at his stall, word filtered from the street near the mosque that a military bus had pulled into the square.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="70"> Army police wearing red berets were checking the papers of male passers-by to see if they were evading the draft.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="71"> The government had just announced a quick call-up of 33-year-olds, extending by a year the liability for military service.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="72"> "War is not good," Ali remarked suddenly.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="73"> A woman fingering stockings nodded slowly and her two children looked up attentively.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="74"> "My brother-in-law is still in prison in Iran.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="75"> He was captured at Nahr Jassem.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="76"> At least a friend of his told us.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="77"> This friend was shot in the head, but he can still speak," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="78"> The woman held a pair of black panty hose in front of her face for close inspection.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="79"> "You know, every night, my family looks at the television to see if my brother-in-law has come back," Ali continued.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="80"> "I have seen many things.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="81"> I have seen men killed in front of me.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="82"> My cousin was killed in Al Faw".</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="83"> The woman lost interest in the hose, clutched her two children and trundled them down the arcade.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="84"> "Lots of things.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="85"> I have stepped on the bodies of dead Iranians, there were so many of them.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="86"> I'll never forget that," Ali concluded quietly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="87"> Outside the arcade, a few young men were ushered on board the military bus, settling rigidly into seats behind smoked glass.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="88"> They had a confused look; some carried plastic shopping bags and seemed to have been intercepted while buying bread.</s>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="89"> The red berets stood by the bus door, clapping their nightsticks into the palms of their hands and scanning the crowds for likely faces.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122390-0161" num="90"> Ali eyed the scene impassively as he stuffed the panty hose back into its plastic wrapper and noted that the bus that brought him to Baghdad from the Iranian border was like the one outside the arcade, only older.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="13"> Among the Iranians sent back to Iran recently as prisoners of war were a number of members of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, commonly known as the People's Moujahedeen, the best-organized opposition to Iran's clerical regime since the revolution.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="14"> When detected in Iran, moujahedeen members are regularly executed.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="15"> Thus, Iraq's delivery of them to Iran amounts to a death sentence.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="19"> Much more than an ideological opposition group, the moujahedeen have created an independent armed opposition to the Islamic leadership in Tehran.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="20"> Secular and leftist in their political orientation, they were part of the revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="21"> That year, conservative religious groups had consolidated their power throughout Iran.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="22"> After eliminating all secular nationalists from the revolutionary government, the clerics began pursuing and arresting moujahedeen.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="23"> The moujahedeen went underground.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="24"> Their leaders, Massoud and Maryam Rajavi, eventually shifted the movement to Baghdad where they enjoyed the support of the Iraqi government.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="25"> It is difficult to accurately gauge the success of the moujahedeen.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="26"> By their own account they constitute a major threat to the Tehran regime, and tens of thousands have been executed in Iran.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="27"> Their slick publicity shows thousands of troops -- men and women -- in continual training, and announces regular battles with the Iranian army in border areas.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="28"> In addition, they claim to have guerrilla forces throughout Iran ready to lead strikes and civil disturbances.</s>

<s docid="LA091990-0009" num="29"> They operate clandestine radio stations and maintain a significant international network of Iranian emigres who demonstrate against the current government throughout the world, with emphasis on its human-rights abuses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="14"> BFN [Text] Tehran, June 25 (AFP) -- Iraq was behind the bloody bomb attack in a holy shrine in Iran which killed at least 24 people and wounded dozens, the semi-official TEHRAN TIMES charged Saturday [25 June].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="15"> "It is unimaginable (to think) that the terrorists group could have undertaken such a heinous act without first having cleared it through the Iraqi intelligence authorities," the English-language newspaper said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="16"> It was referring to the main armed rebel group, the People's Mojahedin, accused by Iran of Monday's [20 June] attack in the shrine of Imam Reza in the northeastern city of Mashhad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="17"> The Mojahedin have strongly denied any involvement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="18"> The daily accused Baghdad of "commissioning" the Iraq-based Mojahedin to "plant the bomb in the holiest site in Iran".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="19"> The Mojahedin "could have obtained such a bomb only from the Iraqi security forces," it said, referring to the 4.5 kilogram (10 pound) device.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="20"> The Interior Ministry said 24 were killed and 70 injured, while the official IRNA news agency said 26 had died and 170 others wounded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="21"> Iran on Thursday [23 June] indefinitely postponed a visit to Iraq by a Foreign Ministry delegation in protest at Baghdad's support for the Mojahedin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="22"> The visit was to continue discussions on normalising ties five years after the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="23"> Talks resumed last October after they were broken in the wake of the Gulf war.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="24"> Tehran has also accused Baghdad of encouraging the Mojahedin to carry out sabotage activities inside Iran and the Iraqi intelligence service of being directly involved in bomb attacks here.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37880" num="25"> Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian said earlier this month that two high-ranking Iraqi officers were arrested for smuggling explosives to Iran and planning bomb attacks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="15"> [Text] An Iranian delegation left yesterday for Baghdad to prepare a visit next month by Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, the first high-ranking official to visit Iraq since the 1991 Iraq-Kuwait conflict.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="16"> Nearly six years after the bloody Iraq-Iran war which ended in a humiliating defeat for Saddam Husayn's forces, the two neighbors are yet to reach a settlement on a number of issues, particularly the fate of POWs and those missing in action, and applying U.N. resolution 598 to pay war reparations to Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="17"> Islamic Iran has emerged as a powerful country in the region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="18"> And Iraq, despite being militarily dismantled after its invasion of Kuwait, and its economy left in a shambles following the U.N. trade embargo, has rebuilt its infrastructure at a stupendous pace.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="19"> It is said that 90 percent of its transport and communication links have been restored.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="20"> Iraq's starving children are only useful media images to buttress its campaign against the U.N. sanctions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="21"> Saddam Husayn stands out as a challenge to the West again.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="22"> Middle East observers say that Washington perceives Iraq, rather than Iran, as the main security threat in the region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="23"> However, given the fact that the United States is determined to pursue the so-called policy of 'dual containment' of both Iran and Iraq, improvement of bilateral ties would be of mutual benefit to the two neighbors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="24"> Moreover, Iraq has learned its lessons well with respect to Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="25"> Baghdad knows that it can't beat Tehran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="26"> Externally, Baghdad is isolated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="27"> Internally, Saddam has formidable problems to contend with, besides a shattered economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="28"> Some of his own people are rebelling against his leadership.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="29"> Besides, he has not been able to crush the Shiite and Kurdish uprisings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="30"> Thus, Baghdad is aware that it is in its own interests to cooperate with the Iranian government rather than confront it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="31"> For Iran too, it would be useful to have good relations with Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="32"> Iraq is not just another Arab country; it has enough skilled and talented people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="33"> It was these same people who restored their country's infrastructure without any outside help, evoking a certain degree of admiration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="34"> The two sides will have a lot of important issues to discuss.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="35"> Another area of importance is trade.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="36"> Once the U.N. sanctions are lifted, Iran can be a major supplier of goods to Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="37"> The current talks will, no doubt, be focussed on removing the obstacles to improving relations, rather than rapid normalization of ties, which can't be foreseen in the immediate future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="38"> The onus rests on Iraq, to help clear the way for restoring Iran's confidence in Baghdad, for its was Saddam Husayn who was responsible for creating the divide between the two nations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="39"> Tehran's mistrust and lack of faith in the Baghdad regime is not without reason.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="40"> Baghdad has been supporting the outlawed Mojahedin-e Kahlq outfit, which is launching cross border attacks from inside Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37162" num="41"> Extraditing its leader Mas'ud Rajavi will remove doubts that Baghdad is supporting the terrorist organization's activities, and may set the right note to tackle more important issues.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="16"> "Not a single other state of the world" is "willing to send such a large number of soldiers to Bosnia," Velayati said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="17"> He said that U.S. assertions that Iranians are already fighting on the side of the Bosnian Muslims "cannot be proven".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="18"> So far, Iran has "only" provided "humanitarian" help to the Bosnian Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="19"> President Rafsanjani has called on Iranian youth to prepare for the mission in Bosnia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="20"> However, they must be dispatched in agreement with the United Nations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="21"> So far, an answer to the Iranian offer has not yet been received from the United Nations, he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="22"> One day after the official announcement of the pardon for German mechanical engineer Szimkus, who was sentenced to death in Iran for espionage for Iraq, Velayati said: "The release of the German depends on agreements that we still have to make with German institutions".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="23"> Minister of State Schmidbauer, who is reponsible for the coordination of the intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, said on Tuesday [14 June]: "I proceed on the assumption that Szimkus might be on German territory within four weeks".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="24"> Velayati rejected speculations that, in connection with the pardon for the German, clear concessions had been made to the Iranians accused in the Berlin Mykonos lawsuit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="25"> "We are only calling for a just sentence in the Mykonos lawsuit," the foreign minister said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="26"> At the same time, he denied Iran's intention to transfer ownership of the Island of Kish in the Persian Gulf, together with the luxurious recreational facilities that had been built under the Shah, to the FRG, in order to repay Iran's high debts to German enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="27"> Radio Tehran had reported relevant considerations on 31 May.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="28"> With outstanding accounts of 4.2 billion German marks, Germany is Iran's biggest creditor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="29"> In the same radio report, President Rafsanjani said: "Iran's capital investments in Germany are higher than the amount that Iran owes to Germany".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="30"> Velayati said: "Nobody has the authority to give an Iranian island away".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="31"> According to Velayati, in the Israeli-Arab conflict, Iran wants to continue its support for the fundamentalist Hamas movement despite the peace process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="32"> Support, which he called "humanitarian and moral," is necessary because the difficulties have not yet been solved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="33"> Pediatrician Velyati, who has been Iranian foreign miniser since 1981, said: "We do not expect the Israeli-Arab peace process to change the situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="34"> The so-called peace process will fail".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="35"> There are still more than 200 Jewish settlements in the territories occupied by Israel and 4 million Palestinians are still living in the refugee camps in Israel's neighboring states.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="36"> An agreement has neither been achieved on the future of the Golan Heights nor on the Israeli occupation of a 10-km-wide border strip in Lebanon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="37"> "Mr. 'Arafat" will "only be the mayor of Gaza and Jericho," but otherwise "nothing has changed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="38"> Therefore, support for the radical pro- Iranian Hamas will be continued.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="39"> Meanwhile, the Israeli Finance Ministry reported on Wednesday that, if the financial means promised to the PLO by European states do not immediately arrive in the autonomous territories, Hamas, which is supported by Iran, will "infiltrate $20 to 30 million" and try to undermine the PLO's policy in this way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="40"> An important prerequisite for the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Iraq is Baghdad's preparedness to deny residence to the People's Mojahedin, who are operating from Iraqi territory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="41"> On the Iraqi side of the border, the People's Mojahedin maintain several bases northeast of Baghdad, from which they mount attacks in Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="42"> There are "indications that" an agreement can be achieved on it with Iraq," said Velayati, who will travel again to Baghdad in July for the first time since the beginning of the Iraqi-Iranian war in 1980.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="43"> Next week, an Iranian delegation will prepare Velayati's visit to Baghdad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="44"> The Iranian foreign minister will discuss the fate of 25,000 missing Iranians from the first Gulf war and closer regional cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="45"> He is prepared to also discuss the Iraqi aircraft that had been taken to Iran before the war for Kuwait's liberation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="46"> However, they can only be returned after a relevant UN decision has been made, Velayati said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="47"> The Iranian foreign minister, whose government repeatedly called for Saddam Husayn's overthrow in the past and is still granting asylum and support to leading members of the Iraqi opposition in Tehran, now said that the Iraqi people have to decide for themselves whether Saddam Husayn will continue to be in power.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="48"> In 1987 Velayati still offered "new security guarantees" to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in the event of Saddam's overthrow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="49"> Now he said that Iran will "not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="50"> The Iranian foreign minister warned the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain) against a military intervention in the Yemeni war and said: "This would be a big mistake in the region".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="51"> Iran supports Yemen's unity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37163" num="52"> Velayati rejected assertions that Tehran is supporting the north Yemeni leadership with weapons.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="6"> THE allied air attack on southern Iraq yesterday comes as Baghdad was showing unmistakable signs of renewed military confidence.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="7"> There have been intensive efforts to repair the damage done to the country's armed forces and defensive infrastructure by the US-led coalition two years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="8"> Western experts say lack of access to spares and new equipment has precluded a recovery of military firepower, in sharp contrast to the build-up of new Russian and other weapons in neighbouring Iran.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="9"> However, President Saddam Hussein is thought to have given high priority to rebuilding Iraq's shattered network of air defences.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="10"> Even at the expense of sustaining further damage, Mr Saddam would relish the propaganda benefit both internally and in the Arab world if his forces succeeded in shooting down attacking US, British or French aircraft.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="11"> Experts do not believe he is contemplating a large-scale military engagement.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="12"> In spite of rhetoric from Baghdad suggesting renewed ambitions over Kuwait, there has been no evidence of force movements to suggest any such drastic step.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="13"> Mr David Bolton, director of the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies, said that in the run-up to yesterday's raids President Saddam appeared to be aiming at gaining support among other Islamic states by provoking the US and its allies into making an attack on questionable authority.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="14"> Alternatively, if the coalition forces had decided against an attack, his calculation was that he could influence neighbouring countries by a show of political strength.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="15"> Either way, Mr Bolton said, President Saddam's tactic was above all an attempt to undermine the sanctions regime and avert further economic decline, which could threaten his own survival.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="16"> Iraq has been unable to replace the heavy equipment destroyed by allied bombing in early 1991 or captured at the end of the war.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="17"> These included some 3,000 tanks, more than 1,800 armoured vehicles and more than 2,100 artillery pieces.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="18"> Under the ceasefire terms, it had to submit lists of stocks and equipment relating to its chemical, biological and nuclear weapon programmes as well as ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 90 miles.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="19"> All these have been in the process of destruction.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="20"> But Iraq is suspected by western intelligence of hiding Scud-B missiles from the inspectors.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="21"> It initially declared holdings of 52 missiles - all but one being longer-range Al-Hussein variants of the Scud - and subsequently admitted to a further 92.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="22"> Iraq bought more than 800 Scuds from the Soviet Union during its 1980-88 war with Iran.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="23"> It is uncertain how many it had left after that war and the 1991 Scud attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, especially since a number were cannibalised to build the extended-range versions.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="24"> However, some analysts think it is unlikely President Saddam would resort to using Scuds.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="25"> That would instantly betray a breach of UN terms and reinforce the legitimacy of any attack on him.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="26"> Iraqi armed forces have been regrouped.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="27"> The military leadership has been reshuffled and the army streamlined into about 30 armoured, mechanised and infantry divisions, compared with more than 50 at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="28"> The country is still reckoned to have some 2,000 battle tanks and 2,000 artillery weapons, including Brazilian-made rocket launchers.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="29"> Up to half of Iraqi land forces are currently believed to be deployed in the north of the country.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="30"> In air strength it clearly remains extremely vulnerable.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="31"> More than 100 of its combat aircraft were destroyed on the ground in the 1991 war, 35 were lost in combat and 112 went to Iran and have not been returned.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="32"> It is left with about 300-350 fixed-wing combat aircraft including some capable fighters such as the Mirage F-1 and MiG-29 but mostly of older vintage and in poor condition.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="33"> They are no match for the western aircraft deployed in Saudi Arabia, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the Gulf and in south-eastern Turkey.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="34"> Iraq has, however, no lack of airfields to operate from.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="35"> It has about 30-40 major air bases, has done a lot of work to repair bomb damage and has started to rebuild hardened aircraft shelters targeted by allied precision bombers.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="36"> Military communications and other infrastructure have also been restored.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="37"> Stocks built up before the 1991 war are thought to have been used to rebuild air defences.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="38"> Iraq has large numbers of anti-aircraft guns - some 5,500, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies - and the allies are considered unlikely this time round to run the risk of low-level attacks.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="39"> The Iraqis also possess sizeable stocks of mostly Soviet-supplied air defence missiles, although many of these are of 1960s vintage.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15236" num="40"> These include the batteries that recently provoked wrath at the UN when Iraq deployed them in the no-fly zone patrolled by western aircraft south of the 32nd parallel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="13"> Article Type:BFN [Text] Tehran, Feb. 21, IRNA -- Two morning dailies here Monday commented over the current visit to Iran of Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Sa'd al-Faysal and expressed pessimism over the result of the talks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="14"> The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' said in its editorial that replacing mutual distrust between Iran and Iraq with an environment conducive to bilateral good will is possible only with the passage of time and the pursuance of a 'one step at a time' policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="15"> It quoted informed sources as saying that Baghdad's main objective in the current talks is to secure the speedy return of its fighter planes held in Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="16"> "The Iraqi regime must realize that while it continues to arm and train anti-Iranian terrorists on its soil bordering the Islamic Republic, it would be childish to believe that Iran will return the planes which can easily end up in the hands of those same terrorists to be used against its citizens", the daily underlined.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="17"> Tehran's reluctance to expand relations with Baghdad stems from the fact that Iraq simultaneously speaks from both corners of its mouth, the paper said adding that from one corner come statements of reconciliation, while the other corner tries to convince the West that another Western investment in Baghdad's war machine is needed to bring Iran's Islamic revolution under control and to secure Western interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="18"> The article concluded by saying that Iraq no longer holds any attraction for its former Western backers, and the stability of the Persian Gulf countries, since the elimination of Baghdad from the regional power equation, has further convinced the West of Iraq's diminished value.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="19"> Commenting on the same subject, the daily `ABRAR' noted that although the Iraqis have so far shown reluctance in taking any positive step in their negoitiations with Iranian officials, they have almost turned over all possible concessions to the U.N. and the West.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="20"> The Iraqi officials hold the idea that through speedy mending of ties with the West, U.S. in particular, their country could regain its political status both at the international community and in the region, the paper added.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="21"> It further noted that the Iraqis, imagining that the West would forgive their past wrongdoings and they would experience the golden days once again, did not deem necessary to follow up negotiations with Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="22"> Therefore, said the editorial, Iraq should abandon its hypocritical and stubborn policy and instead open a new chapter in its relations with Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-35201" num="23"> The paper concluded by saying that no doubt Iraqi statesmen are fully aware of the position and capabilities of both Iran and their own country under the present circumstances and if they act vigilantly they would not miss the chance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="16"> The Iraqi offer is expected to be discussed in detail on the occasion of a visit to Iraq by a high-level Iranian delegation early next month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="17"> The delegation will prepare for a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who will be the first Iranian minister to visit Iraq since 1978.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="18"> Trade and political contacts between Iran and Iraq have rapidly increased over the past 18 months following the two neighboring states' adoption of positive rapprochement when dealing with another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="19"> And it seems that Tehran is now convinced that a change in Iraq's leadership in current conditions would not serve Iran's long-term interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="20"> This is why Tehran is expressing its willingness to help Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to improve his position at least for the time being.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="21"> The two sides are working on a number of issues of "common interest," including the reopening of the Shatt al-'Arab waterway, which will enable the Iraqi port of al-Basrah and the Iranian port of Khorramshahr to resume their activities fully.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="22"> Both Tehran and Baghdad are aspiring to secure "a legal framework" for the border trade which is rapidly growing between them and whose volume is estimated at about $1.2 billion a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="23"> This trade is conducted mostly by smugglers, and it supplies the Iraqi market with a wide range of commodities, including food and consumer durables.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="24"> The two sides are agreed in their determination to prevent the establishment of a separate Kurdish entity in northeast Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="25"> Iranian sources say that tightening the noose around the Kurdish "safe area" in north Iraq has become one of Tehran's priorities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="26"> And French oil companies are putting pressure on Iraq to normalize its relations with Iran so that work can begin in rich oilfields like the Majnun islands and Nahr 'Umar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="27"> Costs of developing these oilfields are expected to reach about $12 billion over six years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="28"> Two giant French oil companies, namely Elf-Aquitaine and Total, have reached "initial agreements" with Iraq to develop these fields.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="29"> Iraq must assure investors that the state of conflict with Iran has ended in order to secure the huge capital needed for this project, as most of the main Iraqi oil wells are situated near the border with Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="30"> A project currently under study is expected to export Iraqi oil via the Iranian province of Khuzestan, thus avoiding Turkish territory and Syria, which Iraq regards as an archenemy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="31"> Besides, exporting Iraqi oil via Iranian territory makes it difficult for the United States and its allies to cut off Iraqi oil exports as a means of putting pressure on Baghdad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="32"> Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati announced yesterday that an Iranian Foreign Ministry delegation will visit Iraq "within the coming two weeks" to continue the discussions over normalizing relations between Baghdad and Tehran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-37307" num="33"> Velayati stressed that he is still hoping to go to Baghdad in July despite the delay in the Iranian mission's preparations for his visit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="15"> Visit to Baghdad, Tehran Puts Pressure on Iraqi Opposition To Freeze Its Activities"] [Text] London -- Iraqi opposition sources have said that the Iranian Government has in recent weeks intensified pressure on the Iran-based Iraqi opposition movements to freeze their activities in preparation for a visit Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati is scheduled to make to the Iraqi capital soon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="16"> The sources -- which are close to Iraqi Shiite movements which have offices and camps in Iran -- revealed that the Iranian authorities have banned these movements from carrying out any military activities across the border.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="17"> They added that the measures included the movements' main offices in Tehran, Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in the Khuzestan region (Arabistan) along the border with Iraq.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="18"> The sources in question told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Iranians have substantially reduced the facilities they have provided to these movements over the past 15 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="19"> In this connection they cited the withdrawal of 23 Iranian vehicles placed at the disposal of the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, which is led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="20"> The sources say that al-Hakim is alarmed at Iranian actions designed to put pressure on the Iraqi opposition to freeze its activities, while Baghdad openly continues to support the Iranian opposition operating from inside Iraqi territory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="21"> Baghdad announced that early in the month Mojahedin-e Khalq carried out military exercises, using heavy weapons, in Iraqi areas bordering Iran.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="22"> And Iraqi media services published a report -- with pictures -- about a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Husayn and Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian opposition movement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="23"> Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid al-Faysal, under secretary at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, visit the Iranian capital last week.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="24"> He held five days of talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry officials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="25"> The talks centered on the outstanding problems between the two countries from the eight-year war (1980-1988) between them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="26"> Especially the issues of prisoners, border demarcation, and regulating navigation in Shatt al-'Arab, in addition to the problem of the Iraqi aircraft that flew to Iran during the Kuwait liberation war in 1991 and which Tehran has refused to return to Baghdad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="27"> Meanwhile press reports published in Baghdad and Tehran spoke of the two sides' failure to secure solutions to these problems during the Iraqi official's visit to the Iranian capital.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="28"> The announcement by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi last Thursday during his visit to Germany that Minister Velayati will visit Baghdad soon is an indication that great strides have been+made in the endeavors to normalize Iraqi-Iranian relations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="29"> Because that visit will be the first to Baghdad by an Iranian official at this level since the downfall of the Shah's regime early in 1979.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="30"> In this context the information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from opposition organizations very close to Iran confirms that Tehran and Baghdad have agreed to upgrade the diplomatic representation between them to ambassadorial level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-12374" num="31"> And that the two capitals are currently considering naming their ambassadors -- which is expected to be announced on the eve of or during Velayati's visit to Baghdad.</s>
