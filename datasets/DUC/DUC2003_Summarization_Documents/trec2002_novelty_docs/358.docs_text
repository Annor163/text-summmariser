<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="9"> A Newhall woman on trial for allegedly killing a motorcyclist while driving drunk had to be held down by four officers and a jail nurse in order to test her blood-alcohol level after the accident, a California Highway patrol officer testified Thursday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="10"> Patricia Lee Giunta, who has had five other drunk-driving arrests and one conviction, also struggled with officers when she was arrested after the crash, CHP Officer Frank Lewis testified at Giunta's trial on a charge of vehicular manslaughter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="11"> The accident on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley on Oct. 4, 1989, killed a Canadian student, David Jaggs, 24, and seriously injured his wife of one month, Janine, 21.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="12"> Lewis said Giunta, 41, twice agreed to breath and blood tests, but then refused to cooperate.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="13"> Finally, Lewis said, he, another CHP officer, two jail officers and a jail nurse restrained Giunta on a gurney while blood was drawn from her arm to determine the amount of alcohol in her system.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="14"> According to court records, Giunta's blood-alcohol content was 0.29% -- more than three times the level at which a motorist is considered legally drunk.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="15"> Jaggs, ironically, was the son of an Anglican priest who counsels alcoholics and drug addicts in Windsor, Ontario.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="16"> CHP Officer Robert Koetting, who investigated the case, said it is "highly unusual" for a drunk-driving suspect to resist a blood-alcohol test to the point where it must be performed forcibly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="17"> But refusal was not unusual for Giunta, who prosecutors said was acquitted in two previous drunk-driving cases largely because she had refused to submit to blood-alcohol tests, which are usually the key prosecution evidence.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="18"> Officers cannot force a drunk-driving suspect to submit to blood-alcohol tests unless they are making a felony arrest for an accident in which someone was killed or injured, as was the case when Giunta was arrested following the crash that killed Jaggs.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="19"> Refusal to allow such a test, however, is grounds for revocation of the suspect's driver's license.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="20"> Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Bill Gengler said Giunta's license was revoked for two years in January for the accident that killed Jaggs and again in April for refusing a blood-alcohol test after she was arrested on another drunk-driving charge while free on bail in the current case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="21"> Investigators describe Giunta as a shrewd defendant who knows how to manipulate the legal system and play up to juries in order to secure an acquittal or dismissal.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="24"> Whyte lost the case in August in which Giunta was accused of driving drunk while free on bail less than a month after the accident that killed Jaggs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="25"> Robert Fernandez, Giunta's attorney, who also has represented her in three previous drunk-driving cases, said authorities are pursuing his client with unnecessary vigor and accused past investigators of lying about evidence.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="26"> "There is a mentality that she's slipped through the system and that they have to convict her at any cost," Fernandez said.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="27"> "I do believe they want to put her away".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="28"> Fernandez, who declined to talk about the current trial, said Giunta "has not beat the system through any kind of tactics.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="29"> The juries absolved her".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="30"> In all but one of Giunta's five other arrests, she has either been acquitted or had the cases dismissed.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="31"> In 1983, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to perform community service.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="32"> The Rev. Ken Jaggs, the dead man's father, who has worked for 23 years counseling alcoholics and drug addicts, said Thursday that the death of his son has affected his work.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="33"> The elder Jaggs, 62, said he now confronts patients more aggressively with the possible consequences of their addictions.</s>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="34"> He said jail is appropriate for repeat offenders provided they receive treatment while locked up.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="35"> Although he refused to comment on the case against Giunta, Jaggs said "we want to see justice done".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="36"> Prosecutors interviewed this week said they were discouraged that her previous arrests are not admissible evidence in Giunta's trial.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101290-0077" num="37"> "She's a danger to society and the sad thing is that you have 12 members of the community who don't know what a danger she is," Whyte said.</s>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="9"> But jurors acquitted Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, of gross vehicular manslaughter, a more serious charge for which she could have faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and eight months when combined with other charges.</s>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="13"> The Oct. 4, 1989, crash on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley left David Jaggs, 24, dead and his wife, Janine, 21, seriously injured.</s>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="17"> She said the motorcycle cut her off, but Janine Jaggs testified that the motorcycle did not change lanes.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="18"> Lacey said that Giunta had been arrested four times for drunk driving before last fall's crash and was arrested again for drunk driving while out on bail in the case.</s>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="19"> But she was convicted only once, in large part because she had claimed that police had lied in the other cases, Lacey said.</s>

<s docid="LA110890-0049" num="20"> "You can only claim the cops lie so many times, and then you have to look at yourself," Lacey told jurors after the verdict was read.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="8"> Jurors in the trial of of Danny David Ornelas asked questions in court Friday afternoon that indicate they may be moving toward a manslaughter, rather than a murder, verdict in the case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="9"> About an hour and a half later, however, the jury recessed for the weekend without having reached a decision.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="10"> The trial began three weeks ago in Orange County Superior Court in Westminster.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="11"> Judge Luis A.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="12"> Cardenas ordered the jurors to resume their deliberations at 9:30 a.m. Monday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="13"> Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, is accused of second-degree murder in the death last Sept. 1 of Debbie Killelea, 37, of Newport Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="14"> Killelea was fatally injured when a speeding car driven by Ornelas struck her as she was walking with two of her children in a narrow alley behind her home on Balboa Peninsula.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="15"> The incident was accidentally videotaped by a young man riding in the car Ornelas was driving.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="16"> Statewide Interest</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="17"> The videotape, along with the outrage community members expressed over her death, has sparked statewide interest in the case.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="18"> Ornelas' defense attorney, Ralph Bencangey of Beverly Hills, argued during the trial that Ornelas should have been on trial for manslaughter, not murder.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="19"> Bencangey said he was encouraged by the jurors' sending written questions to Cardenas asking about vehicular manslaughter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="20"> The questions, which the judge read aloud in court, asked whether a jury must find multiple elements of guilt to convict a defendant of gross vehicular manslaughter.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="21"> Cardenas told the jurors that only one element of guilt is necessary for a conviction of that crime.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="22"> The jurors also asked Cardenas whether it is necessary to find that a defendant had blood-alcohol level of 0.10 or higher in order to convict him of gross vehicular manslaughter.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="23"> Cardenas responded that such a finding was not necessary for a defendant to be convicted of that crime.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="24"> According to unrebutted testimony presented during the trial, a blood test made Sept. 1 about an hour after Ornelas was arrested showed that he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.18 -- almost twice the minimum of 0.10 that state law says constitutes proof of drunkenness.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="25"> A curious twist in the trial was that both the defense attorney and the prosecutor produced expert witnesses to argue that Ornelas was fairly sober at the time of the crash.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="26"> The defense's expert witness testified that the strong rum Ornelas drank just before he got behind the wheel had probably not been absorbed into his bloodstream by the time he hit Killelea.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="27"> That expert estimated that Ornelas' was driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.04.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="28"> The defense argued that Ornelas had tried to avoid hitting Killelea, and Bencangey has told reporters that part of his strategy was to show that Ornelas was sober enough to have been trying to veer away from Killelea.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="29"> Deputy Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="30"> Atty. Thomas Goethals, by contrast, said his intention was to show that Ornelas was sober enough to have "implied malice" in his hitting Killelea.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="31"> A finding of implied malice is a necessary element for a second-degree murder conviction in the case.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="32"> Implications of Actions</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="33"> Jurors asked Cardenas questions about the legal definition of implied malice Friday morning.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="34"> They had told the judge on Thursday that they were "hopelessly deadlocked" and that the question of implied malice was among the stumbling blocks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="35"> The switch that afternoon to questions about gross vehicular manslaughter seemed to indicate that the jury had changed its focus on a possible murder conviction, according to Bencangey.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="36"> The judge told the jurors before they began deliberating Tuesday morning that they had five verdict options: guilty of second-degree murder; guilty of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated; guilty of gross vehicular manslaughter without intoxication; guilty of simple vehicular manslaughter, or not guilty of any crime.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="37"> Ornelas, who looked despondent on Thursday, was smiling outside court late Friday afternoon.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="38"> Bencangey said in an interview: "I think my client has a good chance.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="39">. . . The questions permitted the court, using the law properly, to make it as easy as possible for them (the jury) to find a verdict of manslaughter.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="40"> I'm encouraged" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="41"> He added that he did not think the jurors would have asked about manslaughter if they were still focused on a murder conviction.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="42"> "I don't think so," he said, "but I can't predict what people are thinking.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="43"> You never know.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="44"> Apparently they really are having a deadlock, because even after the judge answered those questions they stayed out the rest of the afternoon".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="45"> Goethals, in a brief interview, said he thought the jury was on the verge of delivering a verdict after it asked the manslaughter questions.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="46"> "Since they did not come back with a verdict, it means they're still working," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="47"> "On we go.</s>

<s docid="LA031889-0124" num="48"> I'm still optimistic".</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="18"> The dramatic performance on Monday brought to a close the Pasadena Superior Court trial of Conway, a 28-year-old former Glendale parks and recreation worker.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="19"> It preceded a lengthy argument by Public Defender Michael Allensworth that Conway was not drunk, but simply driving too fast through a dangerous intersection.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="20"> The trial carried heavy emotional undertones, evident in the grimaces of jurors as they watched a graphic police videotape of the accident scene, in the courtroom demeanor of Conway's elderly mother, Virginia Conway, and in the tearful testimony of a 13-year-old boy who survived that day as he watched his mother and sister die.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="23"> William Kilpatrick Conway is charged with four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter and two counts of causing an accident with injuries while driving under the influence of alcohol.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="25"> Witnesses for both the prosecution and defense agreed on a general account of the accident: On July 13, Conway had driven his mother's 1974 Chevrolet Nova to Verdugo Road in Glendale to help his sister, Louise, change a flat tire.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="26"> Afterward, she left -- and he entered nearby Mike's Verdugo Room bar.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="28"> They were waiting on a dirt-and-gravel traffic island to cross Verdugo Road.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="29"> About 8:30 p.m., three hours after he had entered the bar, Conway came speeding toward that intersection.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="30"> As he rounded the curve of Verdugo, he lost control of the car.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="31"> The mothers and daughters were struck and killed; Billy survived with a broken finger.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="32"> Witnesses and experts for the prosecution testified that Conway was traveling at nearly 80 m.p.h. in the 35-m.p.h.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="33"> zone. Tests within two hours of the accident found his blood-alcohol level as high as 0.15%, they testified; at the time, it was illegal to drive with a 0.10% level, which has since been reduced to 0.08%.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="34"> The prosecution's experts also told jurors that the Nova was old and worn but had no defects.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="35"> And the intersection, they said, although it offered no guard rails or concrete curbs, was not inherently unsafe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="36"> Defense experts testified that Conway was going slower than 65 m.p.h., and was not above the legal limit for intoxication until after the accident.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="37"> They argued that it takes a certain amount of time for alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream, and he had left the bar just before the accident.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="38"> Other defense witnesses described the intersection as dangerous.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="39"> In his closing argument Monday, Allensworth asked jurors to consider a verdict of simple negligence -- a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in jail.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="40"> On the first day of the trial, Billy Cramer offered a tearful recounting of the incident.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="41"> At one point, Judge Carol Fieldhouse recessed the trial for five minutes during the boy's testimony to allow him to recover.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="42"> After the break, Allensworth pressed Billy Cramer about a discrepancy in his testimony.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="43"> Billy had told Rogan that he had less than two seconds to dive from the path of the speeding car.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="44"> But on the night of the accident, Allensworth said, Billy told police he had five to 10 seconds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="45"> "You didn't warn them, did you"? the attorney asked the boy, referring to the four others on the traffic island.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="53"> During the first two days, the victims' families and friends winced as witnesses to the accident recounted it.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="54"> William Cramer, Billy's father, and Patrick Carr, who also lost his wife and daughter, got up and left the courtroom a week later when jurors watched a graphic police videotape of the scene.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="55"> During a recess after the film, Patrick Carr stood nervously outside the courtroom.</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="56"> "Was it bad?</s>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="57"> Did they show their faces"? asked the 38-year-old electrical contractor.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA020790-0030" num="59"> Yes, it was best, a friend answered.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="9"> A year ago today, Linda Oxenreider wept in a Ventura County courtroom as her son's violent death in a traffic accident was recounted.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="10"> The family of Diane Mannes was there too, listening as witnesses described her as a murderer who drunkenly mowed down five young men, killing three of them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="11"> On Wednesday, as Mannes was bound over for retrial on a new set of second-degree murder charges, both families were back in court, sharing the same front row, reliving the night of March 31, 1989.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="12"> "I'll come every day," said Linda Oxenreider, who attended every session of Mannes' first trial last November.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="13"> Mannes' father, her boyfriend and several other family members sat behind the defendant, who was dressed in blue jail clothes.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="14"> They declined to comment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="15"> Mannes was convicted of two felony drunk driving charges and was sentenced to four years in prison last year, but the jury deadlocked on the second-degree murder charges that the district attorney's office had filed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="16"> Rather than accept the initial verdict, the district attorney's office decided to retry Mannes on second-degree murder charges, a decision supported by the victims' families, Linda Oxenreider said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="17"> "What she did to us is absolutely the worst thing you can do to another person -- kill their child," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="18"> What Mannes did, according to witnesses at her preliminary hearing Wednesday and at the first trial, was drink a considerable amount of vodka before driving a 1984 Ford Bronco down the broad S-curves of the Conejo Grade on the northbound Ventura Freeway.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="19"> The Oxenreiders' son Joshua, 19, and four of his friends were walking along the shoulder of the highway after having a flat tire.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="20"> They were about 40 feet from their disabled car when Mannes sideswiped it and plowed into the group, fatally injuring Jacob Boyd, 14, of Camarillo; Scott Mullins, 20, of Mansfield, Ohio, and Joshua Oxenreider.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="21"> Jacob's brother, Jeremy Boyd, 19 at the time, and Jeffrey Botens, then 15, both of Camarillo, were seriously injured.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="22"> Pulling yellow tissues from her purse, Linda Oxenreider cried quietly as Municipal Judge John J.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="23"> Hunter recited some of the facts agreed to by both sides in the case: that Mannes had killed the three men with her car; that her blood-alcohol level was 0.20%; that 43 hours before the accident, Mannes had been arrested in Tarzana on suspicion of drunk driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.26%; that in 1983 Mannes was convicted of driving under the influence in Los Angeles with a 0.34% blood-alcohol level.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="24"> "It fills me with a great deal of rage," Linda Oxenreider said during a break.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="25"> "All this because of the selfishness of one woman".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="26"> Mannes' boyfriend, David Pena, testified Wednesday that he had known her to drink only one other time in their five-year relationship.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="27"> After her drunk driving arrest in the Valley the day before the accident, Mannes told him that she drank because she was upset about long-simmering family matters, Pena said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="28"> Mannes' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt, who unsuccessfully tried to block a second trial on grounds that it would constitute double jeopardy, said in an interview that Mannes suffers from depression and drank sometimes to obliterate her feelings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="29"> The only other witness Wednesday was Tony Dunn, 22, of Simi Valley.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="30"> Dunn was with the youths who were hit but escaped injury because he was on the other side of the guardrail.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="31"> Linda Oxenreider winced as Dunn told of hearing a "smash" of one car hitting another and of seeing the Bronco scraping along the pavement, upside down.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="32"> Dunn climbed over the guardrail, he said, and found all of his friends lying on the ground.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="33"> To get a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutor Donald Glynn must prove not only that Mannes killed the youths, but that her drunken condition constituted malice.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="34"> Dahlstedt argued that the California Supreme Court has ruled that malice exists in such cases only if there is a high probability that the act will result in death.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="35"> He noted that the Ventura court sees thousands of drunk drivers each year but only a few cases in which a death is involved.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="36"> Hunter, however, said the higher a driver's blood alcohol level, the higher the probability that death will result.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="37"> Citing Mannes' prior cases of drunk driving and a program she attended, he said she was well aware of the dangers of drunk driving.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="38"> Hunter scheduled arraignment for June 21.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="39"> Dahlstedt said the trial should start in July.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="40"> The defense attorney said a second trial could have been avoided.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="41"> "We would plead guilty to vehicular manslaughter," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="42"> That charge would result in a maximum term of about 14 years, he said, including the prison time already ordered.</s>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="43"> He said the maximum sentence she could receive for three second-degree murder convictions would be 45 years to life.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061490-0039" num="44"> Dahlstedt said Mannes "knows she has affected a lot of lives".</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="8"> Danny David Ornelas, on trial for murder in the vehicular death of a Newport Beach mother last September, has no memory of the incident, his lawyer said Tuesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="9"> The attorney, Ralph Bencangey, said in an interview that Ornelas cannot remember anything about driving a car in a narrow alley on Balboa Peninsula and striking and fatally injuring Debbie Killelea on Sept. 1.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="10"> An expert witness has also testified that Ornelas had told him he was unable to remember anything about the fatal crash.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="11"> "He (Ornelas) said he can't even remember turning on the ignition," said the witness, Ted A. Mitchell.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="12"> Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, is on trial in Orange County Superior Court in Westminster on a charge of second-degree murder.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="13"> One of the closely watched aspects of the trial has been whether the young defendant would take the stand to give his version of the fatal collision.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="14"> On Tuesday, Bencangey completed his presentation of the defense's case, and Ornelas was not called to testify.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="15"> Bencangey, however, said he may still call him Wednesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="16"> "I'm not going to disclose what we plan to do," said Bencangey, in an interview outside the courtroom.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="17"> The prosecution has accused Ornelas of drunkenly driving a speeding car into the alley and deliberately running down Killelea, 37, as she stood with her two young sons.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="18"> Judge Luis A.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="19"> Cardenas several times on Tuesday prohibited Bencangey from questioning another witness about the effect of alcohol intoxication on memory loss.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="20"> Deputy Dist.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="21"> Atty. Thomas Goethals had objected and the judge agreed, ruling the witness was not an expert in psychology or memory loss.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="22"> Bencangey later said the ruling did not hurt the defense because Mitchell, on Monday, had already testified that Ornelas is unable to remember the car collision.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="23"> Mitchell, an automotive engineer who is an expert in analyzing car accidents, testified Monday that people in such accidents often repress memories of the event.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="24"> Ornelas only has "nightmares and dreams but no specific recollections," Mitchell told the jury.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="25"> On Tuesday, Darrell Clardy, an expert in analyzing behavior of drunk drivers and a toxicologist formerly employed by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, said he believes Ornelas only had a 0.04 blood-alcohol level at the time the collision occurred -- 5 p.m.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="26"> Sept. 1.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="27"> Ornelas, who was arrested 35 minutes after the collision, had a blood alcohol level of 0.18 at 6:43 p.m. when a blood sample was taken, law enforcement experts have testified.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="28"> Under state law, anyone with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 is considered intoxicated.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="29"> Ornelas thus registered almost twice the level of legal intoxication.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="30"> Clardy's testimony in effect challenged whether Ornelas was that drunk when the impact took place.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="31"> Clardy noted that Ornelas and two friends were drinking strong rum at the beach shortly before Ornelas went to the car to drive it down the alley.</s>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="32"> Clardy said strong intoxicants sometimes are not absorbed into the bloodstream until long after being consumed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA030889-0034" num="33"> Bencangey attempted to ask Clardy several questions about how some car accident victims lose memories of the events, but the judge would not allow the questions.</s>
