<s docid="FT932-1044" num="6"> A 51-year-old product, extracted from pregnant mares' urine, is turning unexpectedly into a pharmaceutical blockbuster.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="7"> The success of Premarin - worldwide sales up 20 per cent to Dollars 642m (Pounds 428m) last year and projected to reach Dollars 1bn in 1995 - is a testimony to the fast-growing popularity of hormone replacement therapy for women during and after the menopause.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="8"> Although HRT has been going as long as an average menopausal woman, new research findings are propelling its growth.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="9"> They show that oestrogens such as Premarin not only relieve the immediate symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes, night sweats, fatigue and vaginal dryness, but also help prevent two serious health problems of old age: osteoporosis (fragile bones) and heart disease.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="10"> At the same time drug companies are developing more convenient ways of delivering HRT than the traditional Premarin tablets sold by Wyeth, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Home Products.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="11"> The most important innovation is the transdermal patch, pioneered by Ciba of Switzerland, which releases hormones slowly into the blood through the skin.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="12"> Menopause is defined narrowly as a woman's last menstrual period, which occurs at an average age of 51, but the term is now used more loosely to describe the change triggered by the ovaries' declining capacity to produce oestrogens (female sex hormones).</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="13"> Typically this starts in the late 40s and continues well into the 50s.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="14"> Falling oestrogen levels affect the normal functioning of many body systems, including skin, bone, blood vessels and sex organs.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="15"> The most important long-term impact is to accelerate the normal age-related loss of bone density and minerals.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="16"> The result is osteoporosis, which causes 1.3m bone fractures a year in the US, at a total cost in health care estimated at Dollars 10bn a year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="17"> More than half the women who break a hip in old age will never be able to walk without assistance again and one in five dies within a year of the fracture.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="18"> Menopause also removes the protection from heart disease given by oestrogens, which reduce clogging of arteries and simulate the healthy growth of blood vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="19"> Although younger women are much less likely than men of the same age to die from heart attack or stroke, such deaths increase rapidly after the age of 50.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="20"> HRT aims to restore oestrogens in the blood to a level slightly below what is normal before menopause.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="21"> Although Wyeth and Ciba dominate the market, more than 20 other HRT products are currently available, including surgical implants, creams and pessaries as well as tablets and skin patches.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="22"> Most contain natural oestrogens - either human oestradiol or 'conjugated oestrogens' from pregnant mares.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="23"> These are much less potent than the synthetic hormones incorporated in oral contraceptive pills.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="24"> In addition to oestrogen, women on HRT whose wombs have not been removed by hysterectomy are advised to take cyclical doses of a second hormone, progestogen.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="25"> Its role is to prevent excessive cells building up in the lining of the uterus - a condition that can eventually lead to cancer of the womb.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="26"> Clinical evidence for the long-term benefits of HRT is building up steadily, as the World Menopause Congress in Stockholm has been hearing this week.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="27"> The risk of hip fracture is reduced by at least half after five years of treatment and the risk of heart attack may be cut by 45 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="28"> The proportion of menopausal women in the UK who are on HRT has increased from 4 per cent to 9 per cent over the past five years, according to the Amarant Trust, a medical charity specialising in HRT.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="29"> In the US about 15 per cent are on HRT.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="30"> However, there is scope for far more women to benefit from HRT, says Val Godfree, deputy medical director of the Amarant Trust.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="31"> Busy family doctors do not have time to explain HRT during the 10 to 15 minutes allotted to a typical consultation, she says, or to work out the best therapy for each individual.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="32"> As a result, too many women give up after two or three weeks because of the 'side-effects', before the therapy has had a chance to do them much good.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="33"> The side-effects caused by oestrogen-progestogen combinations - including breast tenderness, bloating and leg cramps - normally disappear within three months, as the body becomes accustomed to the raised hormone levels.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="34"> It may also be possible to reduce side-effects by switching to a different combination and/or from tablets to skin patch.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="35"> Beyond the immediate side-effects, some women steer clear of HRT because they are afraid of the long-term risks of hormone consumption and/or because they think it is wrong to interfere artificially with the natural ageing process - a view that the author Germaine Greer expounded in her anti-HRT book The Change, published in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="36"> (Books about the menopause are a lucrative publishing genre; Gail Sheehy's The Silent Passage, which favours HRT, headed the US bestseller lists last year).</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="37"> Potentially the most serious long-term risk of HRT is a small increase in the chance of developing breast cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="38"> This is still medically controversial but Godfree concedes that the risk of breast cancer may increase from 1-in-12 to 1-in-9 after 15 years on HRT.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="39"> Women who do not like taking sex hormones but still want to protect themselves against osteoporosis may be prescribed other bone-strengthening drugs, notably calcitonins.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="40"> Giving calcium (the main mineral in bone) directly as a dietary supplement does not appear to prevent osteoporosis in well-nourished women.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="41"> But calcitonins - hormones that regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the body - do help by reducing the resorption of mineral from bone into the blood.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="42"> Sandoz of Switzerland leads the Dollars 1bn-a-year calcitonin market with Miacalcic, a synthetic version of salmon calcitonin.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="43"> Until recently, calcitonins had to be injected but Miacalcic is now available as a more convenient nasal spray.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="44"> Bisphosphonates - potent inhibitors of bone resorption - are a new category of drug to treat osteoporosis.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="45"> Sales are still small - only Dollars 80m last year according to Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta and Isaly, the New York healthcare investment company - but they are expected to rise as new products come through clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="46"> Meanwhile, a new generation of transdermal patches will be fuelling the growth of the HRT market.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="47"> The first, Evorel, was launched in Europe early this year by Ortho-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="48"> As with Ciba's original Estraderm, a patch is applied twice a week to the buttocks or top of the legs.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="49"> But with a thickness of only 0.1 mm, Evorel is thinner than Estraderm; it contains oestrogen dispersed in a matrix rather than a liquid reservoir.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="50"> Ortho-Cilag quotes clinical studies to show that Evorel suffers less from two problems of the first-generation patches - their tendency to fall off and to irritate the skin.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="51"> Other companies developing second-generation HRT patches include two US drug delivery companies, Noven and Cignus, and Ethical Holdings of the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="52"> Noven has signed licencing agreements with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in Europe and Ciba in the US, while Cignus is collaborating with Warner-Lambert.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="53"> The main advantage of patches over tablets, apart from convenience, is that the hormone diffuses straight into the bloodstream.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="54"> 'The patch avoids giving large doses of oestrogen to the liver,' says John Stevenson, consultant endocrinologist at the Wynn Institute for Metabolic Research.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="55"> 'It is therefore less likely to cause metabolic disturbances which might be seen with the oral route'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="56"> Menopause-related drugs are one of the fastest growing of all pharmaceutical sectors, as Desai points out.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="57"> Ironically, the growth is based less on new chemicals than on well-known natural hormones.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="58"> Desai expects the overall market for menopause, osteoporosis and bone disease treatments to continue growing at 15 to 20 per cent a year at least until 1996 - 'and the rate of expansion could be even faster if sufficient breadth of new products was available'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-1044" num="59"> The series will continue next month with an article on arthritis treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="6"> DISEASE-MONGERS by Lynn Payer John Wiley Dollars 22.95, 292 pages AND YOU thought the NHS was bad.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="7"> Here is a chilling new book from the US which reveals a conspiracy by the money-grubbing health care industry to convince basically healthy folks that they are ill, and slightly ill people that they are at death's door.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="8"> Lynn Payer, the former medical correspondent for the International Herald Tribune, has written what is sure to be a controversial best-seller.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="9"> It is mandatory reading for Americans, but there are some lessons for Europeans, too.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="10"> Ms. Payer's thesis is that the public is being over-diagnosed, over-medicated, and over-operated upon, because tests, drugs, and surgical procedures are big business.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="11"> Since the demand for 'health' is infinite, the industry (doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies) can sell ever more drugs and services, whether or not they are really needed.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="12"> But to do this, people must be frightened into believing they are not healthy (or could be healthier).</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="13"> Ms. Payer calls this 'disease-mongering'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="14"> The book cites a plethora of examples, including 'Lyme' Disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, chronic candidiasis, depression and 'stress tests'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="15"> In each case, she documents how the problem has been hyped and exaggerated out of proportion.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="16"> Healthy people become unwell just by worrying whether their tiredness is 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', which is itself simply a fancy name for being tired.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="17"> And doctors order huge numbers of tests and then prescribe drugs for problems which could, in most cases, be cured by the body's own processes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="18"> Ms. Payer criticises the 'medicalisation' of normal events, such as menopause and short height.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="19"> As a result of huge media hype, Premarin (a female hormone replacement drug) is the fourth most prescribed medicine in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="20"> This drug may reduce the risk of osteoporosis and heart attacks, but it also may increase the risk of cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="21"> Women are being told they are crazy to refuse hormone replacement, even though many would rather die of heart attacks than of breast cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="22"> And similar panic has caused many children of below-average height to be treated with growth hormones.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="23"> But there is no evidence that these treatments produce a taller adult; and some of those treated before 1985 developed terrible side effects later in life.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="24"> The book also blasts the 'diseasing' of risk factors, such as high cholesterol and blood pressure.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="25"> As Ms.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="26"> Payer points out, these conditions are not diseases but indications of risks for heart disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="27"> People with slightly high cholesterol and no other risk factors may suffer more from taking cholesterol-lowering drugs than they would from eating bacon.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="28"> Another scam: promoting mammography as a cure-all for breast cancer when it does not even detect cancer in young women's' dense breast tissue.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="29"> Why is disease-mongering so successful?</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="30"> Ms. Payer offers several reasons.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="31"> Too many doctors (44 per cent more than in 1980) are competing for too few insured patients.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="32"> Doctors and hospitals are reimbursed for procedures, not for outcomes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="33"> Fear of malpractice lawsuits encourages doctors to prescribe too many diagnostic tests.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="34"> The pharmaceutical industry has incentives to develop and promote more drugs, especially for chronic and marginal ailments.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="35"> US advertising law permits drug companies to market products directly to consumers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="36"> Popular health magazines hype risks with headlines such as '80 per cent of US males at risk for premature death', and rely on drug companies for advertising revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="37"> According to the author, disease-mongering is responsible for much of America's rocketing health care costs.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="38"> Medical testing is a definite villain.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="39"> 'The only two mammals to remove blood regularly from other mammals are vampire bats and humans,' says the book: the US spends Dollars 27bn (Pounds 15.70bn) per year on 5bn to 10bn medical tests.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="40"> Even more troubling is the human cost of unnecessary treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="41"> Ms Payer describes numerous cases in which perfectly healthy people fell ill and died as a result of the side-effects of medical tests or inappropriate medication.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="42"> This book will compel any reader to see that common sense, and the old 'ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' philosophy, is right - most of the time.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="43"> It should also arouse a healthy scepticism of the health care industry and the unholy alliance of interests in America.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="44"> However, the book suggests that the core problem is due to the health care system being too business-like.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="45"> I would argue quite the opposite: if this were a business, the focus would be on catering to the patient-as-customer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-453" num="46"> Which would produce better and more affordable care, prompt treatment and a more humane system.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="6"> LIFE ASSURANCE's origins as a protective measure can sometimes be forgotten, now that it is so commonly sold as a savings or investment product.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="7"> Its usefulness as protection has not disappeared, but it has been joined by an array of other products, designed to protect your standard of living and your dependants against the impact of illness and accidents.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="8"> Life, permanent health and critical illness insurance can all have a part to play in financial planning, particularly for individuals with substantial income or assets to cover.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="9"> The first thing to check is what benefits are provided by any employer's scheme, and work out where they are likely to fall short.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="10"> For example, a company's death-in-service benefit may be set at four times salary, but with the salary capped at Pounds 75,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="11"> For a family accustomed to an annual income of Pounds 300,000, a one-off payment of this amount might not be enough.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="12"> Arranging Pounds 50,000 of life cover can be as simple as filling in a form and signing a direct-debit mandate.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="13"> Unfortunately, arranging Pounds 500,000 of cover can be a rather more complicated process.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="14"> Medical underwriting becomes more rigorous the bigger the sum assured gets: up to Pounds 100,000-Pounds 200,000, companies may be happy to rely on a report from your own doctor.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="15"> Above that amount, a medical will become necessary.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="16"> These days that will usually include an HIV test and an ECG.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="17"> Problems can arise when arranging really large amounts of cover if a single company is unwilling to shoulder the entire risk, so it has to be split between several.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="18"> One company in the group may not be satisfied with the original medical report, and will insist on a second or even third medical.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="19"> For a busy person, this can become too time-consuming.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="20"> Peter Smith, a regional director of fee-based advisers Hill Martin, says he tries to get all the insurers involved to agree in advance to accept a medical from a Harley Street doctor.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="21"> This can have the added benefit of being more convenient for the client, who will not usually be kept waiting as long as at many GPs' surgeries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="22"> The equipment is also likely to be more sophisticated than the average GP can offer.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="23"> Large contracts can require the intermediary to devote a lot of time to shepherding the application through, and clearing up misunderstandings.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="24"> 'Unless you can slot into their boxes, you do have to spend a lot of time talking to them, and talking to the right people.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="25"> It takes a lot longer to get cover than it used to,' says Karina Challons, of independent financial advisers Murray Noble.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="26"> She cites the case of one client who was having difficulty getting acceptance with an insurer.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="27"> They eventually discovered that the underwriter was worried about her course of hormone replacement therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="28"> Insurers will also ask why you need the cover.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="29"> They are usually happiest if it is for standard inheritance tax purposes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="30"> If it is for anything else - for example, shareholder protection - they may demand detailed financial information.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="31"> Some would-be insureds are unwilling or slow to provide this kind of information.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="32"> 'While there are restrictions and conditions imposed by companies, part of the difficulty in getting policies on risk for some high net worth individuals is actually in dealing with those individuals themselves,' says Mark Bolland, of independent financial advisers Chamberlain De Broe.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="33"> He says that one important point to look for, after choosing between variations on whole-of-life or term assurance, is guaranteed insurability at a reasonable cost.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="34"> This means that, if your health deteriorates in the future, you can be sure of maintaining cover.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="35"> For term assurance of less than 10 years, Lloyd's is a possibility - it has the advantage of flexibility, and Lloyd's underwriters are less afraid of unusual risks than some life companies, but Smith says premiums are less competitive than they used to be.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="36"> The need for insurance against premature death is accepted almost without question.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="37"> However, the chances of dying prematurely are considerably smaller than the chances of suffering a serious illness which may leave you unable to work but with large financial commitments.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="38"> Permanent health insurance is designed to provide a replacement income if you are too ill to work for an extended period.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="39"> If necessary, it can pay out until retirement.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="40"> Policies can have different waiting times for payment to begin, depending on your employer's sick-pay arrangements, if any.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="41"> It is a very useful protection product, but benefits are usually limited to about 75 per cent of an individual's salary, less state sickness benefits.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="42"> Insurers also impose cash limits on the benefit payable under PHI policies, even if an individual's salary is very high.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="43"> The maximum benefit is often about Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000; a handful of companies go further (Norwich Union's maximum benefit is Pounds 78,000), but it is rarely possible to replace a six-figure salary under an individual PHI contract.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="44"> PHI policies taken out by businesses may be able to provide a higher income, but for a limited period.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="45"> Anyone who either depends on unearned income (which PHI cannot cover) or wants to top up PHI and life cover could also look at critical illness insurance.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="46"> This can sometimes overlap with PHI, but also covers different circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="47"> Critical illness policies are designed to provide a lump sum if you are diagnosed as having one of a list of serious illnesses.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="48"> The main illnesses covered are heart attacks, strokes and cancer, which account for the majority of claims, as well as organ transplants, heart surgery and numerous other conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="49"> The illnesses do not have to be terminal, or even prevent you from working.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="50"> The lump sum can be used for whatever purpose the insured wishes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="51"> Some critical illness policies automatically include a death benefit; if you already have adequate life cover, it may be better to choose a stand-alone policy, which should be cheaper.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2354" num="52"> Critical illness policies often have clauses including permanent total disablement and loss of limbs, which are also the main ground covered by personal accident policies.</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="6"> CONGLOMERATE Lonrho fell sharply as a result of mixed feelings about its annual meeting and consideration of a hotel chain deal with Libya.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="7"> As the market opened, Lonrho gained 4 on news that it had sold a one-third share in its Metropole Hotels (Holdings) to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company for Pounds 177.5m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="8"> The price was seen to be good and the cash was welcomed as a counterbalance to an estimated debt of Pounds 850m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="9"> However, as analysts considered the political implications of the deal, particularly the prospect that any potential buyer of Lonrho might be discouraged by the link, they took a more cautious view.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="10"> This view was compounded by murmurs of disquiet over general trading voiced at the annual meeting.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="11"> Lonrho traditionally has a very loyal body of private shareholders behind it, but observers said the cracks were beginning to show yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="12"> The stock slipped back in the afternoon to close a net 8 lower at 95p - one of the biggest percentage falls in the London market - with a hefty turnover of 10m shares.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="13"> Rank shines Political considerations helped Rank Organisation as buyers sought the leisure and office equipment group as a hedge to a possible Labour victory in the UK general election next month.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="14"> The shares climbed 15 to 660p in brisk turnover of 1.1m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="15"> Smith New Court initiated the Rank rise yesterday as it put out a strong buy note.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="16"> The broker highlighted the group's credentials of a reasonable rating in an underperforming leisure sector that is poised to improve markedly as the economy recovers.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="17"> 'Rank has the right profile in the right sector at the right time,' said Mr Bruce Jones.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="18"> The point highlighted by Smith and taken up by most investors, however, was that Rank could be a key stock under a Labour administration, with its domestic leisure side - such as bingo halls and holiday centres - largely unaffected by the party's tax plans and economic policies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="19"> It also has a large international exposure through its Rank Xerox subsidiary, which will also be unmoved by a change of UK government.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="20"> Burmah pleases Lubricants to specialist chemicals group Burmah Castrol was one of the strongest performers in the market after announcing 1991 profits at the top end of analysts' forecasts and a confident trading statement.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="21"> The shares jumped 41 to 523p with 2.2m traded.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="22"> The rise was accentuated because expectations had been dampened ahead of the results announcement and analysts were pleased that profit margins had been maintained in spite of a fall in volume.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="23"> County NatWest said Burmah still looked inexpensive.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="24"> The house remains a buyer and has lifted its forecast for this year by Pounds 1m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="25"> It has also raised its dividend forecast by a penny to 25p.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="26"> Reflection on the prospects for TSB following the bank's annual meeting left the shares looking weak against the market on heavy turnover of 8.2m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="27"> The stock lost a penny to 130p.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="28"> Kleinwort Benson's banking team, which was already at the low end of analysts' forecasts, cut its profits estimate for the year to October by Pounds 20m to Pounds 205m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-739" num="29"> The house also shifted the stock from a buy recommendation to a hold following recent outperformance of TSB against the market.</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="6"> Generalising about nations and races is a tricky and not entirely respectable business, even though whole careers are built on it.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="7"> The superior view is that using national stereotypes is vulgar and mentally lazy.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="8"> Yet much depends on how sophisticated the generalisation is or, at the very least, on how it is phrased.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="9"> 'What one should remember about the French is. . .'; 'The key to the Finnish character is . . .'; those are the conversational markers which initially suggest the wisdom of the well-read, well-travelled observer, rather than - although it may indeed be the case - the bar-room bigot.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="10"> The Essential History of Europe: Germany (BBC 2 on Thursdays) was an extraordinarily interesting programme which brandished the sophisticate's version of the national stereotype.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="11"> We were presented with a classic definition of the German as someone obsessed by the 'vices' of obedience, discipline, order, and gripped by an exaggerated sense of dedication and perfection.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="12"> Germans fear the outsider.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="13"> Germans are always looking over their shoulder at the past.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="14"> Just the stuff, one might think, to fuel the prejudices of bar-room bigots everywhere.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="15"> However, observations which would have sounded highly dubious from the mouth of a non-German sounded respectable when spoken as pessimistic home-truths.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="16"> The cleverness of this film was to put Germany on the couch and, apart from an English narrator (perhaps a mistake), to make German speakers and the German language itself stand as witnesses to the troubled state of the German soul.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="17"> Most prominent among the speakers was a psychotherapist from Halle in former East Germany called Hans Joachim Maaz.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="18"> Author of a recent book about the psychological trauma of reunification for East Germans, Maaz proposes an ominous view of the national psyche which few foreigners would feel comfortable about expressing at a German dinner table.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="19"> According to Maaz, the German suffers from the lack of a clear point of view, the consequence of being the obedient child produced by an authoritarian state.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="20"> Democracy has been no more than imposed like a mask, a mantle, on a people whose history has created deep within them an 'inner fascism'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="21"> Setting fire to the homes of Auslander is an all-too typical manifestation of 'the hidden destructive forces which can emerge any moment'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="22"> The film was intelligently structured around conceptual signposts; Zerissenheit, meaning 'a condition of inner strife'; Vergangenheit Bewaltigungs or 'overcoming the past', Heimat, 'homeland', and so on.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="23"> We heard the terms spoken and, in a hopeful attempt to make them stick, were shown them written.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="24"> That kind of didacticism would probably have made your average bar-room bigot switch off long before the grim forebodings of the programme's conclusion, about Seelischer Emfremdung and what will happen should western capitalism ultimately fail to deliver the material goodies which currently compensate for the Germans' spiritual bankruptcy.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="25"> But does this kind of analysis, which to many a British person would seem merely pretentious, actually take us near what real, live Germans worry about? I suspect that it may do, to judge from the experience of learning German at London's Goethe Institut.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="26"> Even though we are mere babes attempting to get our feeble intelligences around the subjunctive tense, Teacher has already introduced the resonant concept of Vergangenheits Bewaltigung.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="27"> Only this week she was exhorting us to attend a public seminar on VB, to be addressed by a minor government minister.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="28"> Which suggests to me that Essential History did get it right, and that the Germans really do revel in discussing their collective psyche in public.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="29"> Now Americans, I fondly believe, possess an innate conviction that the world can always be shaped to accommodate their wishes.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="30"> So it was gratifying on Horizon's Cheating Time (BBC 2, Monday) to hear a 53 year-old singer called Jonie Mosby Mitchell state, 'We don't have to accept the menopause any longer.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="31"> You can do anything you want'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="32"> And so Jonie ignored the ineluctable onset of ageing, the age-freckles on her hands and crowsfeet, and the withering of her womb four years previously with the menopause.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="33"> She went right ahead and had herself a nice little baby boy which she loves very much.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="34"> However, to be accurate, it is only 50 per cent her baby, and genetically not hers at all - and if you are watching Channel 4's absorbing series on sociobiology, The Sexual Imperative on Thursdays at 9.00, you will appreciate what an unnatural thing that is.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="35"> New techniques being practised in the US implant the eggs of donor mothers, fertilised by a woman's partner, into the womb of post-menopausal women which have been rejuvenated with hormones.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="36"> It costs around Dollars 11,000.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="37"> Well, frankly, I do not hold with it.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="38"> However, implantation looks a rather different matter when you see a young woman in her twenties who has already experienced the menopause.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="39"> Should she just bow to fate?</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="40"> But there again, why should any of us women accept the menopause which one doctor described as 'one of nature's design faults'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="41"> We are the only animal to have this particular design fault, and to lead such long lives after we become reproductively useless.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="42"> Already the technology exists to freeze the eggs of fruitflies and return them to their aged mums which then buzz about like youngsters and live many days longer than they should.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="43"> So it stands to reason, does it not, that some women are going to want to have babies in order to live into their hundreds?</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="44"> Is that kind of selfishness really possible? I would say yes.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="45"> After all, Jonie Mitchell admitted she had never asked herself what it would be like for the child of her autumnal years to have such an antique mum.</s>

<s docid="FT931-15358" num="46"> But that is not really part of the picture, is it, if your creed is, 'You can do anything you want?'</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="9"> Another report, originating from an independent Russian news agency, said BP was negotiating the rights to participate in development of a large oil and gas field in Siberia.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="10"> There was also speculation that the US authorities might be about to introduce a more attractive tax regime for oil and gas explorers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="11"> However, most observers attributed the rise to a technical bounce, and one story, that Hanson might be preparing a bid, prompted cynical comments that some traders could be generating rumours in order to square their books.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="12"> A decision by Rank Organisation to put its hotel business up for sale lifted the leisure group's shares 13 to 739p.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="13"> Analysts said the five London and 17 provincial hotels could have a potential price tag in excess of Pounds 300m, although in the current depressed market that figure is debatable.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="14"> However, Rank let it be known that it was willing to wait years if necessary to exact the right price.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="15"> Bears of Rank questioned the logic of selling one of its best potential recovery businesses and the possible length of negotiations.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="16"> However, a more positive view was that Rank would be able to obtain a good price as the hotel market improves, particularly for its prestige London sites, thus reducing its debt burden.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="17"> Union Discount, troubled member of London's most elite monetary sector and once the largest discount house in the world's premier financial market, rose 9 to 138p on the disposal of its 'big ticket' leasing business to French-owned Humberclyde Investments.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="18"> The shares still have a long way to go, however, after falling from last year's peak of 600p, with Union's 'small ticket' business Sabre Leasing remaining the worst problem, contributing to last year's group loss of Pounds 23.5m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="19"> Analysts said big ticket leasing, involving large items such as aircraft, is saleable because of its tax advantages, but it would be a different story if the small ticket office equipment business were to be offered for sale.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="20"> British Aerospace advanced 10 to 355p in brisk turnover of 7m as investors appreciated the arrival of Mr Richard Lapthorne as finance director and the winning of a Pounds 40m contract to upgrade Oman's Rapier anti-aircraft missile system.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="21"> Contributing to the increased turnover were underwriters of last year's failed rights issue releasing stock into the market, and profit-takers that had recently bought shares at lower levels.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="22"> Food retailer Asda lost 1 1/2 at 27 1/2 p, after 26 1/2 p, on turnover of 17m, continuing the heavy trading seen in the stock during recent sessions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="23"> The company is holding a series of meetings with securities houses at present, and yesterday's decline in the share price followed a downgrading by SG Warburg Securities, one of its brokers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="24"> Growing belief that Lloyds Bank will bid for Midland, and that both banks will benefit, ensured that Lloyds firmed 3 to 427p and Midland closed 6 better at 381p.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="25"> The market became aware that first-quarter figures from Sun Alliance were encouraging, particularly following disappointing new life figures last week from Legal & General, up 11 at 382p.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="26"> Sun said its new single premium business was up by 150 per cent and its new annual premium business had improved by 20 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="27"> The stock, which has been the best performer in the FT-SE 100 Index since the general election, gained a further 12 to 294p, still a long way below the 392p price the shares attracted in August last year.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="28"> Bargain hunters for property issues turned away from last week's star stocks and sought other perceived value shares.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="29"> Brixton Estates rose 7 to 176p, Frogmore 22 to 318p and Capital & Counties 26 to 221p.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="30"> Hopes of an economic upturn boosted stores in heavy turnover - although County NatWest said it felt the sector was becoming overvalued.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="31"> Investors looking for recovery stocks were encouraged into Burton, which improved 3 to 50 1/2 p on turnover of 10m.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="32"> Shares in TI Group, which last week bid for Dowty Group, were in demand after Standard & Poor's, the US credit rating agency, confirmed an A1 rating on TI's debt.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="34"> Among transport stocks, Eurotunnel remained in the doldrums as the company announced it was to appeal against a dispute panel's ruling in March that it makes a Pounds 50m payment to TML, the Channel tunnel constructor, as a settlement of the dispute between the two parties.</s>

<s docid="FT922-10935" num="35"> Wellcome fell sharply in early trading in reaction to a Sunday newspaper article which raised doubts about the pharmaceutical company's anti-Aids drug Retrovir and the origins of Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="6"> A new plastic extrusion technology developed by Eropol, a small French engineering company, could change the life of millions of women suffering menopause symptoms.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="7"> A joint venture between Dow Corning of the US and Sweden's Kabi Pharmacia has launched an intra-vaginal ring on to the Swedish market.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="8"> The UK and France could follow suit.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="9"> IVRs have long been discussed for birth control and menopausal purposes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="10"> Hormones embedded in the ring's silicone material are released in a controlled manner to ease menopause symptoms or prevent conception.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="11"> Until now, the technology has not been available to produce these cost-effectively.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="12"> Eropol's solution involves an extrusion tool into which are fed, simultaneously, the hormone-doped silicone material forming the central core of the ring and the pure silicone material surrounding it.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="13"> To obtain the circular profile, with a core concentric to its surrounding silicone layer, the flow of material into the extrusion die must be carefully regulated.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="14"> The silicone entering the extrusion die is split into 10 streams, through the centre of which is introduced a stream of the doped silicone.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="15"> As each stream's flow can be controlled, Eropol can achieve the required quality of extrusion.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="16"> Once extruded, the string of hormone-doped silicone is cut into small lengths which are joined and become perfectly concentric because of the cut's conical form.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="17"> The rings are placed into moulds with heating elements to harden the silicon.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="18"> The aim is to develop an auto-regulating mould capable of adapting to the silicone's expansion during heat treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="19"> It would stay open during the hardening process, with the halves kept apart under the pressure of a spring to allow the silicone to expand.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="20"> The mould would then be closed and two tools inside it would perform the deburring action.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="21"> That part of the process has not been mastered and the rings are finished by hand.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="22"> Eropol expects to deliver the automated solution next year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-10438" num="23"> This technology could also serve to develop a contraceptive ring.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="7"> IF YOU feel like complaining about insurance companies, you are not alone.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="8"> The insurance ombudsman disclosed in his annual report this week, that he had to handle 4,334 cases last year - a rise of 64 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="9"> Meanwhile 13,899 people made inquiries in writing and 26,048 by phone.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="10"> In two thirds of cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, and the report includes examples of dishonest claims.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="11"> But 32 per cent of the time, policyholders were awarded money.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="12"> A total of Pounds 5m was awarded, ranging from Pounds 500,000 (over the unusual case of a disputed death benefit on a life policy) to two awards of Pounds 5.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="13"> The ombudsman's scheme includes more than 340 companies, and is used as the complaints resolution mechanism by Lautro, the life assurance and unit trust regulator.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="14"> How should you go about complaining if you have an insurance problem?</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="15"> The ombudsman's office should be regarded as a destination of last resort.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="16"> Your complaint must first have been referred to the senior management of your insurer, which must be given an opportunity to resolve the complaint.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="17"> Once you have received a final judgment from the company, you must contact the ombudsman within six months.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="18"> It is also important that the matter concerns you personally (not someone else's policy) and that your policy or contract was issued in the UK, Isle of Man or Channel Islands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="19"> The ombudsman will not step in if the complaint is already the subject of legal proceedings or arbitration, or if it concerns a policy in the name of companies or partnerships rather than individual people.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="20"> You cannot complain to him about commercial risks, or levels of premiums.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="21"> Importantly, given the volume of letters to the Weekend FT which this area generates, complaints about surrender values, bonuses and rates of return on life policies are also off-limits.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="22"> If your problem passes all these tests, write to the ombudsman.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="23"> You will then be asked to fill in a form, and provide relevant documents (you will, deservedly, be scuppered if you have not bothered to keep them).</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="24"> There is no charge and you do not need legal or other professional representation.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="25"> Should you employ a solicitor, it will be at your own cost.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="26"> The ombudsman has wide powers to command the insurers to produce information, and can hold investigations.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="27"> The average case takes four months and 24 days to clear up.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="28"> The chief virtue of the scheme is that it is cheaper and quicker than going to court.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="29"> This tends to be longer in financial services disputes where there are allegations of mis-selling by salesmen - a common problem.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="30"> Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, was not optimistic that the Securities and Investments Board's proposals on disclosure and the publishing of 'key features' documents about products would significantly cut complaints about life assurance and investment products.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="31"> He welcomed the suggestion that sales representatives should be forced to write to clients explaining exactly why they had recommended one product rather than another.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="32"> By the end of this year, this could be a legal requirement, and would provide an extra defence when policies have been wrongly sold.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="33"> This might clamp down on some of the outrageous selling tactics mentioned in the report.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="34"> One salesman explaining why he had sold a whole-of-life policy to an unmarried 18-year-old with no children, who wanted to save, said: 'The reason I did not attempt to sell a Capital Accumulation Plan (a 10-year endowment) is because in February 1988 I was unaware the Capital Accumulation Plan existed.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="35"> In fact, my first CAP sale was not until July 1988.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="36"> Perhaps if my training had included the plan, I would have marketed it more often.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="37"> However, at the time, my training had only included the Financial Security Account and the Personal Retirement Account'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="38"> The ombudsman decided that the entire sale had been unsuitable.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="39"> It is alarming that a salesman was let loose on the public while still insufficiently trained to give suitable advice.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="40"> Half-truths are also used.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="41"> One salesman denied assuring a widow that she would receive at least 10 per cent income a year from an investment bond.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="42"> However, he admitted he had said, in response to repeated questions, that he was sure it would do better.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="43"> It did not.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="44"> The sales were set aside, and she was paid interest.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="45"> These cases suggest the dangers for consumers, and show why it is worthwhile to complain.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="46"> But Dr Farrand also suggested a list of three 'don'ts' for policyholders who want to complain: Do not be dishonest.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="47"> Plenty of people are.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="48"> The report cited the example of a pensioner who claimed that a refrigerator breakdown ruined 93lbs of meat in his freezer compartment - allegedly a week's supply for the claimant and any guests that might drop by.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="49"> Investigation showed that the freezer could only hold about 42lbs, and so the ombudsman found in favour of the insurer.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="50"> Dishonesty can also attach to claims about disability.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="51"> According to Dr Farrand: 'A video showed an allegedly disabled roofer hammering nails into tiles and gutters.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="52"> After the show, despite commenting that it had been one of his better days, he was able to appreciate the insurer's stance without further argument'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="53"> Do not be reckless.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="54"> The test that claimants show that they used 'reasonable care' has been relaxed, according to Dr Farrand, but is not finished altogether.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="55"> For example, there was no joy from the ombudsman for the man whose car was stolen after he had knowingly left it unlocked with the keys in the ignition while he ran back into his house to collect something.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="56"> However, this test is subtle.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="57"> There was a pay-out for the parents of the boy who fell to his death while trying to jump from one hotel balcony to another, because he did not realise there was any danger, but not for the teenager who died after a daring dive from a high bridge, who it was thought must have realised the risks he was taking.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="58"> Do not have unreasonable expectations.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="59"> Read the small print, the minutiae can often be distressing.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="60"> For example, a woman being treated with hormone implants for menopausal symptoms appealed to the ombudsman when her insurers gave notice that they would only pay for another six months.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="61"> The policy covered costs of treatment for 'medical conditions' which were defined as 'any disease, illness or injury'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="62"> As the menopause plainly does not qualify under any of these headings, the ombudsman ruled that the insurers need not have paid anything at all.</s>

<s docid="FT921-537" num="63"> The insurance ombudsman, City Gate One, 135 Park St, London SE1 9EA. 071-928-7600.</s>

</HEADLINE>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="5"> By JAMES BUXTON</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="6"> SHIELD Diagnostics, which will be floated on the Stock Exchange next month, is that rarity among the crop of biotechnology companies that have come to the market recently: one that already has products on sale.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="7"> The Dundee-based company has 23 products for diagnosing illnesses in use worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="8"> Its sales have increased fourfold in each of the past two years, partly by acquisition, and reached Pounds 1.7m in the year to March 31 1993, having been Pounds 110,000 in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="9"> The fact that it has been selling products distinguishes it from four of the five biotechnology companies which have been listed on the Stock Exchange in the past 14 months: out of British Bio-technology, Tepnel Diagnostics, Celsis Diagnostics, Anagen and Drew Scientific, only the last is earning money from its products.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="10"> Yet Shield's path to a listing has been no smoother than many other high technology companies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="11"> Founded in 1982 with eight people, it only started shipping products in 1990, and last year it lost Pounds 653,000, though that was better than the previous year's deficit of Pounds 1.4m.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="12"> It is not expected to break even until 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="13"> Shield was created by entrepreneurial scientists from Dundee university and the city's Ninewells hospital.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="14"> Its field has always been that of in vitro diagnostics - the diagnosing of diseases in tests outside the body.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="15"> In 1987 Mr Hamish Hale of the venture capital company Alan Patricoff Associates (now named Apax Partners) became its chairman and Shield, under new management, raised Pounds 4.5m of venture capital funding.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="16"> It built up a strong team of managers by 'cherry-picking' senior staff from established biomedical companies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="17"> But by 1990 it had already spent Pounds 8m on research and development without bringing any product to the market.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="18"> In that year Mr Hale recruited Mr Gordon Hall from Abbot Diagnostics, the big US diagnostics company, to be chief executive.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="19"> 'My task was to get some products out and get the budget under control', says Mr Hall.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="20"> His own diagnosis of Shield was that its strength lay in developing and manufacturing diagnostic discoveries; but it was hampered, like the other small biotechnology companies, by high fixed overheads.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="21"> Although the company soon began marketing a range of kits that test for a variety of auto-immune diseases, Mr Hall bought in discoveries from other companies which Shield could manufacture, thus spreading the overheads burden.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="22"> Last year Shield acquired two products from Northumbrian Biologicals, which added nearly Pounds 700,000 to its turnover.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="23"> They were a test for chlamydia, a sexually transmitted, genito-urinary disease which affects women, and for cytomegalovirus, an agent which can produce infections and for which donated blood is increasingly being tested worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="24"> 'Our products are consistent, which those of some of our small rivals are not,' says Mr Hall.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="25"> 'That means they will have the same characteristics in a year's time as they have today, which makes them a reliable test'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="26"> Shield, he says, is not dependent on the UK's National Health Service, which he says pays poorly.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="27"> It exports two-thirds of its output, mostly to multinational diagnostic companies in the US, Germany and elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="28"> The company has high hopes for two of the tests which it has under development.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="29"> It is perfecting an advanced form of test, based on research by Oxford university, to enable doctors to predict whether a person is likely to suffer heart attacks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="30"> With Stago of France it has attracted a grant of up to Pounds 445,000 from the EC's Eureka fund for promising technology.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="31"> It hopes the test, already being sold for research purposes, will be on sale in three years time.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="32"> 'It's a big market.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="33"> Already 500m cholesterol tests for heart disease risk are carried out each year worldwide', Mr Hall says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="34"> Shield has also started work on a test to identify women at risk from the disease osteoporosis, which causes brittle bones after the age of 45.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="35"> Mr Hall points out that there are 12m women aged 45 or over in the UK alone.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="36"> The flotation, which should capitalise the company at Pounds 20m, will be a placing and will raise new equity to fund future development.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="37"> The company intends to acquire other companies and buy in new products.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="38"> It would like to become the biggest British-owned company in the field of in vitro diagnostics.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="39"> 'Obviously we don't expect to go on growing at the same rate as the last two years,' says Mr Hall, 'but we expect reasonable growth in sales'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="40"> More space at the company's headquarters on the Dundee Technology Park is being converted from offices to manufacturing.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="41"> Staff now total 45.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="42"> The company is speaking to analysts ahead of next month's flotation, which is being sponsored by the Glasgow stockbrokers Allied Provincial.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="43"> The existing institutional shareholders are expected to stay on board.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="44"> Led by Apax, they also include the venture capital funds Cygnus Ventures, Summa and Grosvenor Ventures.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="45"> Scottish Enterprise, the successor to the Scottish Development Agency which helped Shield in its early days, is a small shareholder.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="46"> Shield will come to the market in the same month as Scotia Pharmaceuticals, the drug company formerly known as Efamol, which concentrates on products based on fatty acids and funds its research from sales of evening primrose oil as a dietary supplement.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="47"> Though currently based at Guildford in Surrey, Scotia has strong Scottish connections, manufacturing some of its products at Callanish in the Western Isles, and may shortly establish a plant in Dundee.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="48"> Scotia was founded by Dr David Horrobin 16 years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="49"> It made pre-tax profits in 1991-92 of Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 16m.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="50"> Earlier this month dealings in its shares were suspended ahead of the flotation, details of which have not been disclosed.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8376" num="51"> The shares had traded at a price which would value the company at more than Pounds 180m.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="5"> Concern is growing over the potential dangers of Nolvadex, ICI's main anti-cancer drug, after the Medical Research Council's decision to study more information before approving funds for a clinical trial.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="6"> The New Scientist said that the MRC delayed approval after receiving new information about the drug's toxic effects on rats.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="7"> Nolvadex is a well-established drug, generating sales of Pounds 240m last year for ICI.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="8"> The trial, which would involve 15,000 women, is aimed at discovering whether Nolvadex - used to treat breast cancer since the 1970s - could be used as a preventative measure on healthy people.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="9"> The article was underscored by a report quoting the University of Texas's Galveston medical school.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="10"> The report said Nolvadex might cause liver cell damage.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="11"> Researchers said they found a proliferation of liver cell mutations in laboratory rats after three days of injections with the drug.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="12"> Mr Richard Henderson, a chemicals analyst with Nomura Research, said: 'It is quite clear from existing literature that the effect on laboratory rats is radically different from that on people.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5687" num="13"> However, the behaviour of the MRC suggests that there is something new out there and maybe it is in the Galveston story.'</s>

<s docid="FT943-5755" num="6"> Two papers published in this week's British Medical Journal show they may not be getting the best possible drugs, unlike their male counterparts.</s>
