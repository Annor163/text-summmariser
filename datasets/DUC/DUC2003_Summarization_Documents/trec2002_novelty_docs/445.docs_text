<s docid="FT941-7858" num="6"> The Church of England will have women priests from next month following final approval of legislation by its general synod yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="7"> More than 1,000 women deacons are likely to seek ordination to the priesthood during the coming year now the final legislative hurdle has been overcome.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="8"> The first ordinations will take place in Bristol cathedral on March 12.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="9"> Yesterday's decision by the synod concluded a legislative process that has been in progress for more than five years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="10"> Some male clergy and lay people are leaving the church over the decision.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="11"> After the synod's move Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, urged all members of the church to unite in proclaiming the gospel 'to a world in need'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="12"> He recognised that some who were opposed to the legislation would regard the decision with regret.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="13"> 'To many more, this is a moment for rejoicing in the confident expectation of the rich and diverse gifts women will bring to the priestly ministry'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-7858" num="14"> Several other provinces of the worldwide Anglican communion, including the Church of Ireland, already have women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="7"> THE Church of England will never be the same again after next Wednesday, when its general synod votes on whether to ordain women to the priesthood.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="8"> Supporters and opponents of the move, divided on almost everything else, are at least agreed on that.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="9"> The debate happens to be taking place on November 11 - Armistice Day - but no armistice will follow the result.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="10"> Some people will leave the church if it ordains women priests; others will leave if it does not.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="11"> Church-going is a minority activity in modern Britain.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="12"> Around 7m people are practising members of the main Christian denominations, which is low by the standards of other European nations.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="13"> Only around 2m adults worship regularly in the Church of England.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="14"> But interest in the national church continues to reach far beyond its active membership.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="15"> The BBC, reflecting this, will broadcast next week's entire debate live on radio and the decisive, afternoon session on television - giving it parity with big parliamentary occasions and political party conferences.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="16"> Some among this wider audience of non-churchgoing viewers and listeners may question the idea of women priests in the same way as they are unhappy about female voices in choirs, hymns written since the start of this century and church architecture that does not look at least vaguely gothic.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="17"> They regard the Church of England as a repository of timeless - in reality more often Victorian - values that should be preserved in familiar and unchanging form.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="18"> Next week's debate is not for them.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="19"> It is about the future shape of the church rather than about preserving traditions - even 2,000-year-old ones - for tradition's sake.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="20"> For the church no other subject, with the possible exception of a decision on disestablishment, could run next week's debate close in either importance or potential for division in an institution which takes pride in its powers of comprehensiveness, co-existence and compromise.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="21"> A synod decision in favour of women priests would need to pass through parliament before becoming law, and divisions have already opened among MPs and ministers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="22"> John Gummer, the agriculture minister, might leave the Church of England if it agrees to ordain women.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="23"> Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has declared herself in favour and recently sponsored the Movement for the Ordination of Women's first meeting in the house of commons.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="24"> If next week's debate were taking place under parliamentary procedures, there would be no doubt about the outcome.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="25"> A majority of synod members will vote in favour of women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="26"> The synod, however, votes in three houses - bishops, clergy and laity - each of which must approve the change by two-thirds majorities.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="27"> Even this demanding threshold will almost certainly be met by the bishops and clergy.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="28"> If the move to ordain women is defeated, it will be because it fails on the narrowest of margins to scrape a two-thirds majority among lay members of the synod.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="29"> In a related vote earlier this year, support for women priests reached only 61.4 per cent in the house of laity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="30"> Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, last month defended the church's 'slow and cumbersome' decision-making process, saying 'dictatorship of the simple majority' could cause worse tensions and problems.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="31"> Campaigners for women priests will not settle for such calm rationalisation if the vote goes against them next week.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="32"> Representatives of most of the 44 dioceses have voted in favour of ordaining women and, if the move is thwarted because it just misses a two-thirds majority in one of three houses, there will be accusations that the dictatorship of the blocking minority has been at work.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="33"> The difficult implications of ordaining women have been recognised throughout years of preparation leading up to next week's vote.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="34"> Some male priests would leave the Church of England - a financial compensation scheme has been devised for them - and relations with the Roman Catholic Church would come under severe strain.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="35"> It has become apparent as the final decision has neared, however, that a vote against would be just as divisive and difficult for the church to handle as one in favour.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="36"> If the vote is lost, supporters of women priests are threatening sanctions including an 'ordination strike' - male deacons refusing to accept ordination to the priesthood until women deacons could become priests as well.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="37"> The Rev Philip Crowe, principal of Salisbury and Wells theological college, says he would be unable to continue in his post if the church adopted an official policy of opposing women's ordination.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="38"> Other high level resignations might follow.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="39"> The bishops are under acute pressure to maintain a united front whatever the result, but some have very publicly endorsed the ordination of women.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="40"> One or two might find it impossible in the new circumstances to continue ordaining men.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="41"> It has even been suggested that retired bishops might be prepared to carry out unlawful but valid ordinations of women.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="42"> Dr Carey would be left in an exposed position personally by a 'no' vote.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="43"> Since leapfrogging much longer-serving bishops to become Archbishop of Canterbury last year, he has maintained whole-hearted support for women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="44"> There have been mutterings among a few senior colleagues that the archbishop was unwise not to take a more neutral line given the uncertainly of the outcome.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="45"> But Carey - the first non-Oxbridge archbishop of Canterbury since the Middle Ages - comes not from the pages of Trollope but from an east London council estate and secondary modern school.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="46"> He is not a natural exponent of the fence-sitting skills that sometimes pass for leadership in the Church of England.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="47"> Supporters hope a heartfelt speech from a sincerely-convinced Carey will win over enough waverers to carry the vote.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="48"> Outside the active membership of the church, the debate over women priests - turning on such arguments as whether there are theological objections to a woman representing Christ in the celebration of Holy Communion - can appear medieval and arcane.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="49"> But the church began moving towards the ordination of women before sex equality issues achieved their current political and social importance.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="50"> There have been women priests in the worldwide Anglican communion for nearly 50 years - the first, Florence Tim Oi Li, ordained in China in 1944, died this year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="51"> Since then women have been ordained in other Anglican provinces, not always in the most tranquil of circumstances.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="52"> Dr Peter Carnley, Archbishop of Perth, ordained Australia's first ten women priests earlier this year without the authority of the Australian synod and after a supreme court bid to block the ordinations had failed.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="53"> 'Today we ordain ten but we liberate tens of thousands,' he declared in a phrase that illustrates the depth of feeling aroused by the issue.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="54"> The battle to win the argument for women priests in the mother church of Anglicanism is continuing unabated right up to Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="55"> Potential waverers among synod members are being lobbied as forcefully as Conservative backbenchers in this week's Maastricht vote; advertising campaigns have run in the religious press.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="56"> An advertisement by the Movement for the Ordination of Women features Dr Susan Cole-King, a British-born medical doctor who went to New York as senior health adviser to the United Nations children's fund in the 1980s and became a priest in the US Episcopal church.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="57"> Today she is back in Britain as minister in charge of Drayton, Oxfordshire.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="58"> Dr Cole-King conducts baptisms, weddings and funerals, leads services, presides at meetings and offers individuals support and advice.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="59"> She lives in a house called the vicarage and is, in the eyes of her parishioners, the vicar of Drayton - except that she cannot use the title as it is restricted to priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="60"> Although Dr Cole-King is a priest, in England she has only the status of a deacon.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="61"> The most significant effect of this is that she is prevented from undertaking the exclusively priestly functions of celebrating Holy Communion, pronouncing absolution and the blessing.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="62"> Like other women deacons in charge of parishes, she has to maintain a rota of male colleagues who are available to celebrate communion.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="63"> If a car breakdown prevented one from arriving to say the Eucharistic Prayer, the service could not legally continue.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="64"> '. . . who in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread and when he had given thanks, he brake it and gave it to his disciples saying, Take eat, this is my body . . '.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="65"> The Eucharistic Prayer: the point in the Holy Communion service at which the bread and wine is consecrated.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="66"> Words that in England only a man can validly say.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="67"> This is, says Dr Cole-King, the only real difference between her role and that of male priests in neighbouring parishes.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="68"> But, reflecting on her work in Drayton and her previous ministry among the homeless in New York, she adds: 'The Eucharistic Prayer is not what makes a priest a priest'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="69"> Her experiences in New York and Oxfordshire draw her to the conclusion that, when confronted with a women priest, most parishioners find 'there really is nothing particularly special' about the experience.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="70"> 'The biggest problem for people in Drayton was deciding what they were going to call me, particularly as I followed someone who called himself Father John.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="71"> I had no wish to be called Mother, and resolved the problem by suggesting that people called me by my name'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="72"> Women priests are knocking at the door of the Church of England.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="73"> They are already ordained in the Church of Ireland.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="74"> Scotland, where women ordained overseas are allowed to celebrate Holy Communion, and Wales could follow soon.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="75"> England itself has women deacons - undiscernable from priests to the lay eye - running parishes.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="76"> Even the staunchest opponents recognise what this means.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="77"> A 'no' vote next week might win them a few years.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="78"> But there will be women priests in England before long, whatever the outcome of the debate.</s>

<s docid="FT924-9001" num="79"> They will eventually become as much part of the natural, unchanging Anglican tradition as robed choirs, festivals of nine lessons and carols and all that other 'timeless' ceremonial inherited from only a century ago .</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="6"> ENGLAND IS set to have women priests within two years, following a close vote in the Church of England's general synod yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="7"> A passionate debate ended with a measure making it lawful for women to be ordained to the priesthood being carried in all three houses of the synod - bishops, clergy and laity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="8"> The measure required a two thirds majority in each house.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="9"> The vote among the laity was expected to be close, and the result was 169 votes to 82.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="10"> Had only two lay members voted the other way, the ordination of women would have been blocked.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="11"> The bishops voted in favour by 39 votes to 13 and the clergy by 176 votes to 74.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="12"> Legislation now has to pass through parliament and, although there are more than 1,000 women deacons waiting to become priests, the first ordinations are not likely before late 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="13"> While parliament usually accepts decisions of the Church, there may be opposition to a proposed scheme of financial compensation for male priests who resign when women are ordained.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="14"> The historic decision was greeted by potential women priests singing by candlelight outside the synod meeting at Church House, London.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="15"> Some opponents spoke against the ordination of women on theological grounds.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="16"> Others opposed the nature of the legislation which will enable individual parishes to decide whether they want the ministry of a woman.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="17"> But many of the Church's most senior figures strongly supported the proposals.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="18"> Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, argued that the Church's voice was in danger of not being heard in 'an increasingly confused and lost world' if women were 'exercising leadership in every area of our society's life save the ordained priesthood'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="19"> The Rt Rev Robert Williamson, bishop of Southwark, said that in his south London diocese he had to confront some of the chronic injustices in society.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="20"> He said he could not do this with integrity in the face of the apparent injustice of the church denying women the opportunity to test their vocation to become priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="21"> The Church faced divisions whichever way the vote went.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="22"> A hint of the potential difficulties surfaced in the debate when the Rt Rev David Lunn, bishop of Sheffield, said that if the changes took place he did not see how it would make sense for a diocese to have a bishop who, like himself, could not wholeheartedly support the new arrangements.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="23"> The Rev June Osborne, a woman deacon in east London, pleaded with the synod to allow her to carry out her ministry as a priest.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="24"> But Mr John Selwyn Gummer, agriculture minister and a member of the synod, responded that the only way in which Ms Osborne could test her vocation to the priesthood would be by removing the vocation from a number of male priests who felt they could not remain in the church if women were ordained.</s>

<s docid="FT924-8156" num="25"> Mr Gummer had suggested that he might leave the Church of England over women's ordination, and last night Ms Ann Widdecombe, a parliamentary colleague and social security minister, said that she intended to leave.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="7"> The distance between regular Church of England congregations and once-a-year churchgoers will be greater than ever this Christmas.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="8"> Occasional, seasonal visitors will notice nothing amiss.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="9"> The cribs and carols will still be in place in more than 16,000 churches throughout the land, blending holiness with homeliness in the secure Anglican style.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="10"> More involved members of the church, however, will be asking how much longer it is going to stay like that.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="11"> The church faces unprecedented financial problems on such a large scale that they could permanently change its shape.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="12"> Within a few years, a century-long trend of insufficient candidates coming forward for ordination has been reversed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="13"> The Church of England now has more clergy than it can afford.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="14"> Suddenly, all the R-words that became commonplace in industry during the 1970s and 1980s - retrenchment, rationalisation, restructuring, even redundancy - are being uttered nervously in clerical circles.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="15"> The problem's seriousness is illustrated by the view of Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, that finance, rather than the divisive question of next year's ordination of women priests, is likely to be the most significant issue of his period in office.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="16"> Matters came to a head for the Church of England with a decline in the value of the Church Commissioners' income-producing assets from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="17"> Much of 1993 has been taken up with investigation and painful debate over the commissioners' stewardship of the church's assets and their devastating over-exposure in the property market.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="18"> An investigation found that the commissioners' assets committee had compounded their problems by borrowing substantially to finance further speculative property development, while failing to maintain adequate managerial control.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="19"> Bewildered members of the commissioners' board of governors complained afterwards of having been denied information about assets committee decisions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="20"> The church has untangled the tragic cycle of events with impressive charity, showing little of the collective desire for recrimination and scapegoats that would have dominated the reaction of most institutions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="21"> Attention is being concentrated on the consequences of the mistakes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="22"> The Church of England has lived beyond its means for many years, relying on the commissioners' investment income to finance the experience.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="23"> Warnings signs were evident in the 1980s as a new clergy pension scheme and other costly, long-term commitments were taken on.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="24"> Between 1981 and 1991, when the retail prices index rose by 78 per cent, the cost of clergy pensions and retirement housing increased by 226 per cent, and spending on church buildings by 245 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="25"> So the sharp decline in the commissioners' asset values is not the single cause of the present problems; but it means solutions must be attempted in an atmosphere of crisis rather than a more gradual, planned way.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="26"> The commissioners pay for pensions and housing for retired clergy, and contribute substantially to stipends.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="27"> But the proportion of the stipend bill met from their assets - 45 per cent in the early 1990s - will fall below 30 per cent by 1996.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="28"> Some dioceses will receive still less.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="29"> It costs about Pounds 600m a year to run the Church of England.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="30"> Last year clergy stipends and housing cost Pounds 229m, worship and buildings Pounds 201m and administration Pounds 65m.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="31"> Parishes generated the biggest slice of income - Pounds 372m - and the Church Commissioners Pounds 161m.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="32"> The decline in the commissioners' investment income means an extra Pounds 50m a year must be found elsewhere to meet running costs and pensions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="33"> Churchgoers in the parishes are the only potential source of the extra money.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="34"> A 15 per cent increase in the Pounds 372m raised locally would produce Pounds 55m and, if sustained annually, solve the problem.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="35"> But the church, like charities in general, has seen little real growth in voluntary donations in recent years - they fell in real terms in 1990, and increased by only 2 per cent above inflation in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="36"> Getting an extra 15 per cent from the parishes would be the equivalent of raising the entire voluntary income of Oxfam each year on top of existing collections.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="37"> And, although there are signs that the rate of decline in church attendance -a social trend shared by the Church of England with other Christian denominations throughout the post-war years - has slowed since the mid-1980s, the church will be trying to squeeze more money from a diminished base.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="38"> About 1.1m people now attend Anglican churches regularly, compared with 1.5m in 1970.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="39"> Some parishes will rise to the task of becoming self-sufficient, but in doing so will expose a further problem.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="40"> The Church of England may have fallen on hard times financially, but it remains structured as a national church in a very real sense.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="41"> Every acre of England is in an Anglican parish; its clergy are deployed around the country on a fair-shares basis related to population and geography, and the church retains an elaborate central decision-making and policy-developing structure.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="42"> It maintains several thousand schools; runs theological colleges; has responsibility for many historic buildings and, through its boards and committees, contributes to debates on religious and social issues.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="43"> In future, some parishes may have full-time priests - or continue to exist - only if they can meet the costs locally.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="44"> Moves in this direction are already occurring in some dioceses.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="45"> A consultation document in London, which plans to pay its stipends without any Church Commissioners' support within ten years, proposes that if a parish is unable to make an adequate contribution to staff costs 'a careful assessment ought to be made concerning its future'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="46"> Unco-ordinated moves in this direction could have far-reaching consequences for the nature of the national church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="47"> Parishes working hard to meet all their own running costs would, influential figures such as Alan McLintock, chairman of the church's central board of finance, believe, be reluctant to contribute to the national 'head office' institutions that give the Church of England so much of its distinctive character.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="48"> Relationships between clergy and congregations could change if priests felt wholly dependent on their parishioners for continued employment.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="49"> Vacancies would be filled on the basis of available funding rather than priority needs, with clergy skewed towards the suburbs and away from the inner cities and peripheral estates which the church regards as important mission areas.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="50"> 'Greater financial self-sufficiency need not mean the triumph of inward-looking congregationalism,' Dr Carey told the church's general synod last month.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="51"> Such fears are, however, very much alive.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="52"> An alternative to such an every-parish-for-itself approach advocated by the Rt Rev David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool - whose diocese includes many relatively deprived areas that would find it impossible to meet full clergy costs from local resources - is to encourage stronger church-going areas to make more use of part-time, unpaid ministers, enabling inner cities and other priority areas to retain substantial numbers of stipendiary clergy.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="53"> There are around 11,000 stipendiary clergy and another 2,000 non-stipendiary ministers - ordained clergy who combine their ministry with secular employment and do not receive a salary from the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="54"> Increased reliance on non-stipendiary clergy and lay workers is one probable consequence of the financial problems.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="55"> The church does not set limits on candidates considered for ordination but, says a new report by its Advisory Board of Ministry, it might become necessary to restrict the number it can afford to pay.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="56"> Those called to ordination, says the report, should 'not themselves seek to impose conditions as to whether their call is to stipendiary or non-stipendiary work'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="57"> Although the Church of England pays better than some denominations - a Salvation Army officer starts on an annual Pounds 3,350, rising to a Pounds 3,990 maximum after 45 years - the financial rewards of the ministry are modest by most secular standards.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="58"> The average for a vicar is between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 13,000.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="59"> Church leaders emphasise the need for appropriately motivated men and women to offer themselves for ordination remains as great as ever.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="60"> But today, potential candidates are warned to set aside any notions of social standing that may once have compensated for limited financial rewards.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="61"> Future clergy, says the Advisory Board of Ministry report, will find their ministry very different from that of their predecessors.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="62"> It will, it says, 'embody much of the insecurity and vulnerability that is characteristic of our time'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="63"> Canon John Stanley, a church commissioner and member of the general synod, endorses this point.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="64"> He says that declining church attendances, and the increased secularisation of society, are leading to some clergy feeling isolated, lonely and undervalued; he is concerned that worries about the church's financial future will become an additional pressure on them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="65"> Many clergy are worried that rushed solutions to the financial problems, involving emergency cost-cutting against impossibly short timetables, could spiral the church into local initiatives that would undermine its status as a national church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="66"> Canon Stanley argues for a controlled response.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="67"> 'I believe there is a danger of increasing the scale of the problem if people rush at it too much,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="68"> 'I know that raising individual giving is not easy, but we must remember that if everyone gave Pounds 1 per week more the problem would disappear.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="69"> There is a need for a steady hand and strong nerve'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="70"> Church finances will be under further pressure next year when male priests unable to accept women's ordination, leave and qualify for payments under a compensation scheme.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="71"> There are also dangers that the women priests issue, allied to financial problems determining whether some churches close, could upset the doctrinal ecology between the Church of England's high and low church wings.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="72"> Most of the defections of priests and parishioners over women's ordination will be among Anglo-Catholics, while many of the parishes proving most successful at raising money and attracting growing congregations are evangelical.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="73"> One of the deepest concerns voiced by clergy and lay people is that the church, shocked by the Church Commissioners' investment problems, might go to the other extreme and be carried away by an obsession for budgetary control.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="74"> 'We cannot keep the Church of England alive by the contributions of individual congregations alone,' says the Very Rev John Gladwin, Provost of Sheffield cathedral.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="75"> 'The Church Commissioners' originally obtained their money from the reserves of the old cathedrals and bishoprics to help finance the living ministry of the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="76"> There is absolutely no point in solving the problem in a way that enables the commissioners to balance their books, and creates a sound pension scheme, but leaves no money to finance an active ministry'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="77"> Dr Carey told last month's synod that 'complacency and panic' were equally out of place as a response to the financial problems.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="78"> Nothing is more certain, however, than that some will panic while others remain complacent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="79"> For all its structure, much real decision-making in the Church of England remains with individual bishops in 43 dioceses, while most of the clergy hold their posts on freehold and cannot be moved against their will.</s>

<s docid="FT934-408" num="80"> In such circumstances, steering a course of sound, rational management between the twin rocks of complacency and panic will be unusually difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT931-9901" num="6"> THE CHURCH of England, which has a Pounds 500m annual budget and 11,000 clergy, is bringing itself into line with other organisations of its size by releasing a corporate video.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="8"> The birth of her first child may be in God's hands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="9"> Her ordination is in the hands of the general synod of the Church of England which debated the divisive subject of women priests again this week and could give final approval in November.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="10"> Barring parliamentary accident, the crop-headed young curate of St. John the Evangelist in Goose Green, south London, will then be able to celebrate the Eucharist and to give absolution - she, and about 1,000 other women, already ordained deacons, who are priests in waiting.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="11"> The church will gain another male priest, too: Dilly's husband, Chris, curate of the neighbouring parish of St Barnabas, who has delayed his own ordination in sympathy with his wife.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="12"> Dilly Baker's tomboy haircut and progressive views could suggest a militant feminist, a woman subconsciously trying to be a man.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="13"> But there is nothing mannish about her big eyes, wide mouth and giggly laugh - she is younger than her 30 years - and nothing strident about the way she talks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="14"> I asked her to describe her vocation.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="15"> 'My sense of vocation has never been the kind of blinding light from heaven,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="17"> I mean, I'm here because I believe that I am called to be a priest, but the Church of England does give me severe jitters at times'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="27"> 'I feel my ministry is incomplete without the priestly part.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="30"> 'I would find it very difficult to continue in the church in my present position'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="31"> Do you see it as a woman's right to be ordained priest?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="32"> 'It's a very loaded term, that'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="33"> Yes, I said; it was deliberate.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="34"> The curate sighed.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="35"> 'I don't think I want to talk in terms of rights because that just turns people off.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="36"> I might want to talk in terms of justice.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="37"> Men and women are created together in the image of God and to deny women the ability to represent Christ is, I think, a fundamental break with justice.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="38"> But I'm not the sort of person to go around talking about women's rights too earnestly'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="40"> 'I'm reluctant to say Yes because feminism is such a dirty word for a lot of people.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="41"> But feminism has helped us to see more clearly what has been going on in the church, the way women have been treated and understood'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="42"> The church was taking its cue from secular society, but would lose all credibility if it did not press ahead.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="43"> And there was a precedent - its renunciation of slavery after centuries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="44"> Just under a third of the laity but slightly more than a third of the clergy oppose the ordination of women, according to diocesan poll results discussed this week.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="45"> Many regard it as the feminist component of a general slide into trendy theology and secularism.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="46"> Dilly Baker (her real name is Hilary) acknowledged a theological connection.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="47"> 'It's not simply a matter of who says the Eucharistic prayer.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="48"> We're dealing with something very important: how we understand God, how we understand sexuality and relations between women and men.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="49"> So long as the church says that women cannot adequately represent Christ at the altar then our theology is open to question'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="50"> Is the gender of God a separate question from whether women should be priests or not?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="51"> She hesitated.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="52"> 'I personally don't think it's separate.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="53"> But let's be honest.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="54"> There's no sex to God.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="55"> It's a convenient metaphor.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="56"> We're talking metaphors all the time here and I think we need to enlarge our vision of God all the time.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="57"> But 'women priests equals female God' is not what I want to say at all'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="58"> Devout Anglicans see women's ordination as the last nail in the coffin of traditional Christianity.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="59"> (A few have gone further, claiming that in New Zealand it has caused an outbreak of 'religious witchcraft').</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="60"> 'There are as many, or more,' said the curate, 'who feel it's not fair to dump it all at the feet of women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="61"> To have women as priests redresses the balance a little bit but no way does it alter the fundamentals of the faith'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="62"> Some objectors quote Biblical authority for their views, others are just shocked by the thought that such a long tradition is to be broken.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="63"> Yet Methodists, Baptists, and other English non-conformists have already broken it, and there are 1,500 women priests in Anglican churches overseas - and two women bishops.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="64"> For Dilly Baker, the fact that Jesus chose male disciples is not persuasive.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="65"> They were not chosen as priests, and church hierarchies developed much later in accordance with social custom.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="66"> The fact that Christ was a man did not prevent him conferring important roles on Mary and Martha.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="67"> 'Jesus came to take on our flesh to understand us as human beings,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="68"> 'It's that taking on of our humanity that is of essential importance, not the maleness. . . or else the gospel has really nothing to say to women'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="69"> She also rejected the argument that women priests would damage prospects of unity with the Church of Rome.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="70"> 'To suggest that it's just these few pushy women who are stopping unity is not very accurate.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="71"> Anyway I would want to say 'Unity at what cost''?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="72"> What about the unity of the Church of England itself? I asked.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="73"> What will the cost be if the ordination of women goes ahead?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="74"> 'Well, I think the Church is going to be greatly enriched by it'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="75"> She laughed.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="76"> 'I can say no other, can I'?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="77"> Don't you take seriously the threat that a lot of people will leave?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="78"> 'I don't think a lot of people will leave.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="79"> Some will, just as some people will leave if it doesn't go through.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="80"> That's very sad and I'm sorry about that.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="81"> I feel it's unnecessary since as the legislation stands there will still be a place for people who are opposed to women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="82"> But there are also people we don't hear about who have left, who don't come to church because of the way the church treats women'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="83"> What about the church splitting?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="84"> 'I don't know how seriously to take that.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="85"> Whether it's scaremongering tactics I don't know.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="86"> 'But I do know - and I'm in a High Church here where you expect to find most opposition - that as people have got used to me as a minister, they have become comfortable with the idea of women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="87"> Because I'm standing behind the altar and the symbol has gradually changed for them, they have got used to it'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="88"> Some clergymen cannot get used to it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="89"> One, after a recent conversation with a woman deacon, suddenly stopped and said: 'Why do you insist on wearing that bitch collar'?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="90"> The incident prompted me to ask why so many homosexual clergy (they form a large minority in the London diocese) were hostile.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="91"> The mother-to-be, so far serene, looked uncomfortable.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="92"> Eventually she said: 'I would want to affirm gay people in their sexuality.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="93"> I don't want to be seen as opposed to gay people.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="94"> I feel upset that they can't see the connection between the way the church has treated gay people and the way it has treated women.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="95"> It's all part and parcel of the church's inability to come to terms with sexuality'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="96"> She agreed that the Church of England could be seen as the last male bastion.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="97"> 'Men have been heading this show for so long.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="98"> Women will bring a breath of fresh air, a little more imagination and creativity, and will open the whole thing up.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="99"> Maybe that is why some men are so very threatened by the whole issue'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="100"> I asked her how women priests would differ from men.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="101"> Once more, she was reluctant to employ 'stereotypes'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="102"> She finally agreed that women might find it easier to extend sympathy, especially to other women.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="103"> The family of a parishioner whose funeral she recently conducted had said as much.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="104"> Finally, I asked her: do you think it's God's will that women should be priests?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="105"> 'Yes,' she said, very quietly.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="106"> 'I certainly do'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="107"> Do you kneel down and pray to be told this is the right thing for you?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="108"> 'Yes. That would be quite an apt way of putting it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="109"> I have thought about it and prayed about it and struggled with the issue for some time and I'm absolutely certain this is the way forward - not just for me as an individual but for the church in general'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="110"> So you have God on your side?</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="111"> 'Oh, you wicked . . .] I never talk in terms of God on my side.</s>

<s docid="FT921-7364" num="112"> I do think it's God's will but I'm not so naive as to say the opposition wouldn't say the same thing.'</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="6"> The financial crisis confronting the Church of England is of classic Micawberish dimensions: rising spending and too little income.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="7"> In 1992, the Church cost about Pounds 600m a year to run, of which nearly half was taken up by the stipends, housing and pensions of its 20,000 serving and retired clergy.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="8"> A further Pounds 200m went on worship and buildings.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="10"> The cost of pensions and retirement housing subsidy grew at nearly three times the rate of inflation between 1981 and 1991 - from Pounds 18m to Pounds 58m a year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="11"> The number of clergy pensioners rose by nearly a quarter due to longevity and a sharp rise in early retirements.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="12"> The pensions bill will continue to rise far faster than inflation and investment returns.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="13"> Pensions are linked to earnings, not prices, and the demographic profile of the clergy peaks late in the 50s.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="14"> A large proportion of women priests, and women set to be ordained, are in their 50s.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="15"> The C of E's central funding agency is the Church Commissioners, a statutory body established in 1948 and responsible to parliament.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="18"> Their contributions to clergy stipends and housing subsidies rose from Pounds 26m to Pounds 66m in the 1980s, and its grants to cathedrals from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.8m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="19"> The commissioners also have to pay compensation to clergy resigning because of the ordination of women - estimated at well over Pounds 11m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="21"> Misguided property investments late in the 1980s depleted their asset base (now Pounds 2.4bn, down from a peak of more than Pounds 3bn in 1989), and actuaries advise that they are over-distributing income if the assets are to be protected.</s>

<s docid="FT944-2077" num="22"> One report suggests that the commissioners need to draw about Pounds 20m a year less in income than the Pounds 161m they drew in 1992 - yet, meeting future pension liabilities requires an extra Pounds 30m a year on top of that figure.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="6"> Millions of Christians will not be celebrating Easter this weekend.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="7"> It is not because they have stopped believing in the Resurrection but because they belong to the Orthodox Church.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="8"> Easter follows the first full moon after the spring equinox.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="9"> For this calculation the Orthodox still cling to the old Julian calendar, according to which the spring equinox occured on April 3.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="10"> The result is that their Easter is still a month away.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="11"> The discrepancy is just one symptom of the great schism between the churches of Byzantium and Rome, usually dated to 1054 AD when a papal legate threw a Bull of Excommunication on to the altar of Santa Sophia in Constantinople.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="12"> A thousand years later, Christian clergy of east and west are still looking for reconciliation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="13"> If anyone understands what that involves, it is Bishop Kallistos of Diokleia, assistant to the head of the Greek archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, university lecturer and author of a standard work, The Orthodox Church.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="14"> For behind the black-rimmed spectacles and whiskery silver beard - an accoutrement which does for an Orthodox priest what a full-bottomed wig does for a British judge - there hides an Englishman.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="15"> Bishop Kallistos began life as Timothy Ware, the son of an English soldier.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="16"> His father was a brigadier in the Durham Light Infantry and fought in two world wars.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="17"> Both parents were churchgoing, middle-of-the-road Anglicans.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="18"> The boy was not military, not even athletic, but very precocious intellectually: he suffered a bout of religious scepticism at the age of 13 when, arriving at Westminster School, he began to read philosophers such as Bertrand Russell.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="19"> 'I do remember thinking when I was 13 there is no proof for the existence of God,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="20"> (Russell made the same discovery at about the same age, but with quite different results).</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="21"> By the age of 14, Timothy Ware had returned to religion.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="22"> 'Not because I found any single answer,' he said, 'but because I concluded there were a great many things in this world that could not be proved, that almost all the things by which we directed and guided our lives were attitudes for which there was no proof.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="23"> Then I also thought about why I have feelings of right and wrong - not just conditioning, but going deeper than that'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="24"> He considered becoming a Roman Catholic but found the Pope's claim to supremacy inconsistent with his reading of early church history.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="25"> A visit to a Russian Orthodox church at 17 made a deep impression but it was six years later, after taking a double First at Oxford and studying theology, that he joined the Greek Orthodox.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="26"> When he was ordained in 1966 he was the first non-Greek priest in the British diocese.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="27"> 'In the end I felt what mattered was not nationality, but truth,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="28"> 'If Orthodoxy taught the Christian faith with a fullness not possessed by other communities, shouldn't I join them, whatever the historical limitations?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="29"> Truth is universal'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="30"> In the west, Orthodoxy is largely a church of immigrants.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="31"> It is also fragmented along national lines.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="32"> Parish organisation has improved but there are few western converts, and those tend to be from the university-educated professional classes: John Tavener, the English composer, is one famous example and Bruce Chatwin, the author, was on the point of joining when he died.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="33"> In Russia, however, the church is enjoying a big revival following the collapse of communism.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="34"> 'People feel communism has let them down desperately badly and are looking for some meaning to life,' the Bishop said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="35"> But is there, I asked him, any sign of a general religious revival as we approach the millenium?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="36"> 'What I do think,' he replied, 'is that while there is deep disillusionment with organised religion there is nonetheless considerable spiritual thirst and interest in the inner resources of the human person.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="37"> 'This may take different forms.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="38"> Some 20 years ago people looked to India or Zen Buddhism.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="39"> Nowadays people are drawn often to the 'New Age' - a lot of what that means makes me feel very unhappy.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="40"> Nonetheless, I can see a spiritual craving there, a rebellion against the values of a purely material way of life.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="41"> The interest in ecology is another aspect of it.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="42"> But churches don't seem to be responding'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="43"> How, I asked, could a church as antique and traditionalist as the Orthodox hope to respond?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="44"> 'I would want to say that tradition has to be understood as a living reality, not simply rigid conservatism.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="45"> Real loyalty to tradition implies a critical spirit.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="46"> You've got to look at your past inheritance and say which bit of it is essential, which just historically conditioned.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="47"> I would like to see the Orthodox Church living its tradition much more intelligently and reflectively'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="48"> The focus of his religious loyalty is the doctrine of the Trinity, which he described as much more than a theoretical piece of complex speculation, and of the Incarnation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="49"> 'I am very troubled by the great growth of an extreme radical, liberal position within Anglicanism,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="50"> 'I respect the sincerity of the people who are grappling with great questions.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="51"> But the way they set out to answer those questions is not likely to bring the country back.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="52"> It's not a way to help people in moments of crisis and despair'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="53"> Also important, he added, was 'the immediacy of the invisible world'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="54"> Christianity should never become 'just a philosophical theory or a social programme'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="55"> Orthodox rank-and-filers tend to resist reunion with western Christians.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="56"> Where Orthodoxy is the national religion there is no need.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="57"> Immigrant communities of the diaspora take refuge in it.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="58"> And western converts do not convert in order to be brought back again.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="59"> I asked the Bishop whether secularism could provide the impetus.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="60"> 'I wouldn't want us to unite because we both felt weak.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="61"> When two businesses do a merger because each is losing clients that's not necessarily a recipe for commercial success.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="62"> I would hope myself that in the west we can have friendly relations with other churches but remain firm in upholding our own position'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="63"> The most likely, even imminent, reunion would be with the so-called Oriental Orthodox of the Middle East, north Africa, Armenia and India which veered off after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="64"> Among western Christians, the Roman Catholics are doctrinally closest.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="65"> But there are some serious historical vendettas to be overcome.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="66"> The Serbs, for example, remember massacres at the hands of Croatian Catholic fascists during the second world war, and have witnessed continuing destruction of their churches even outside the fighting zones.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="67"> In the Ukraine, there is resentment against the Vatican-supported revival of the eastern Catholic, or Uniate, church.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="68"> Bishop Kallistos said the chief doctrinal problem was the Pope's claim to infallibility and jurisdiction over the whole of Christendom.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="69"> But, he argued, under another pontiff both claims might be susceptible to redefinition.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="70"> So, too, might the filioque, an obscure but ancient theological argument about the Trinity: the Latin church claims that the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Son as much as from God the Father.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="71"> Nor, the Bishop said, need there be much dispute about the real presence at the Eucharist even though the Orthodox regard the Roman word 'transubstantiation' as a dubious piece of Aristotelian interpolation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="72"> Orthodoxy is both more traditionalist, but also more mystical, fluid and decentralised than Roman Catholicism.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="73"> For example, its bishops do not take the Vatican's hard line on artificial contraception, nor on divorce.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="74"> They permit married men to be ordained (but not priests to marry).</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="75"> In relation to Anglicanism, the problem is reversed.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="76"> There is no historical legacy of hatred, but there are serious doctrinal obstacles.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="77"> 'There are high-church Anglicans whose faith is really the same as ours,' the bishop said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="78"> 'But over the past 50 years there has been a growing liberalism too on the Trinity, the Incarnation and the bodily Resurrection.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="79"> We cannot envisage joining a body where such diversity of opinion is possible'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="80"> And women priests?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="81"> His answer was a surprise.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="82"> For he thinks the gender of the clergy is 'an open question' which has never been studied in theological depth.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="83"> His complaint about the Church of England's decision to ordain women is not that it was done, but that it was done without a proper theological debate.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="84"> 'Is the difference between men and women only a matter of procreation?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="85"> Or is it much deeper, about different ways of thinking, working and feeling'?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="86"> The doorbell rang and the Bishop went out to meet another visitor.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="87"> After a few moments he came back and said: 'There is something else I would like to say.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="88"> 'I do believe that Orthodoxy makes demands on people.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="89"> I would never say it offers a soft option.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="90"> But I also believe it is a faith as much for English people as for Greeks or Russians.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="91"> I didn't become an Orthodox just because I like things Greek and Russian.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="92"> I became one because I felt I could find in Orthodoxy a fullness - and I do very deliberately use that word.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="93"> 'It's not that I think Orthodoxy has everything and the western churches have nothing.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="94"> I simply believe that the light I had already found in Anglicanism - that I'm sure can be found also in Roman Catholicism - was to be found in a fuller, purer form.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="95"> 'So it is not that the west has nothing but that the Orthodox church has more.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="96"> Having said that, I would add that from an empirical point of view and for historical reasons there are many human failings in Orthodoxy.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="97"> I don't deny that.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="98"> 'That is why I think Orthodoxy could learn many good lessons from the west.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="99"> The west can help us to understand our faith better.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="100"> And that's the great benefit we could derive from talking to western Christians: not that we would import a lot of western ideas that are foreign to us, but see better who and what we are.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="101"> 'Also, in becoming Orthodox I did not feel I was betraying my own western culture but really discovering its true roots and true meaning.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="102"> I know that to my friends it seemed a highly eccentric action.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17503" num="103"> But I feel it's not made me less English, but more English.'</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="12"> In addition to the 43 dioceses there is a policy-making General Synod, the Church Commissioners, the Central Board of Finance, a pensions board and the offices of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="13"> Yet the church is a Pounds 630m-a-year operation for which no single body has overall managerial responsibility.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="14"> Church leaders, faced with the biggest financial pressures of modern times, recognise this as a source of inefficiency in decision-making that must be changed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="15"> A variety of interconnected problems came to a head with a Pounds 800m slump in the value of the Church Commissioners' assets between 1989 and 1992, caused mainly by over-investment in property.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="16"> Although the asset values have since begun to recover, the collapse brought belated recognition that the church had become over-dependent on the commissioners, who contribute to clergy stipends and housing and provide pensions.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="17"> Churchgoers are already painfully aware of the consequences for them - parishes must meet more of the clergy pay bill, while dioceses are likely to have to start financing pensions under plans to be published later this year.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="18"> But the consequences for the way the church is managed will be equally far-reaching.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="19"> A commission chaired by Rt Rev Michael Turnbull, incoming Bishop of Durham, is reviewing the entire central organisation and policy making structure, and its relationship with dioceses and parishes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="20"> Commission members began work with a presentation on management structures from Charles Handy, visiting professor at London Business School, discussing with him issues like the fashion for federal organisation in companies.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="21"> But although the Church of England has in many ways the ultimate federal structure, comparisons with business have limitations.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="22"> 'We have an organisational structure that in some senses is very progressive and accords with modern management thinking - indeed, a number of fashionable terms like mission statement and subsidiarity have religious origins,' says Philip Mawer, general secretary of the Church of England general synod and a former senior civil servant.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="23"> 'But even in federally structured companies, there are ways for the central management to exercise control.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="24"> The downside of our highly dispersed and locally-based structure is that we do not have arrangements at the centre to pull the threads together.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="25"> There is no Church of England board'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="26"> Although Bishop Turnbull has described the existing structure as 'clumsy and cumbersome', his commission is unlikely to propose simply sweeping it away when it reports next year - that could be a recipe for a debate lasting a decade.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="27"> Radical change is, however, possible.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="28"> One idea being discussed would amalgamate the officials of bodies like the synod and Church Commissioners into a single central support staff.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="29"> A similar approach could apply locally, creating Church of England area offices to provide services to groups of bishops and dioceses.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="30"> As well as saving on administration costs, this form of organisation would increase the scope for spreading common policies - and more of a 'corporate culture' - within the fragmented structure.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="31"> Two reports to be published in advance of Turnbull this autumn will increase pressure on the church to adopt a more overtly managerial style.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="32"> A study of clergy conditions of service will address the future of the freehold system, by which most incumbents have total job security until they choose to move or to retire.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="33"> That is likely to lead to more formal ways of dealing with individuals who underperform.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="34"> The second report will consider the way cathedrals are run.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="35"> Famous historic churches are not only places of worship - many are large tourist attractions competing in increasingly commercial style for a share of the leisure market.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="36"> The extent to which such business activities have moved beyond bookstalls and brass rubbing is illustrated by the Westminster Abbey Experience currently being offered to visitors to London.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="37"> It is a mixed-media show in a temporary auditorium alongside the abbey which, by using archive film and a replica Coronation Chair, 'draws on techniques more familiar to theme parks and the theatre', as the authorities admit.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="38"> Yet cathedrals are run by dean and chapter in a managerial style that appears as ancient as most of the buildings.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="39"> With members of the commission producing the report including Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Storehouse, and Peter Burnham of Coopers & Lybrand, a more business-like approach to the church's commercial activities may well be recommended.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="40"> Ultimately, however, the church is not a commercial organisation but a voluntary one.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="41"> While, in common with many charities, it faces pressures familiar to private- and public-sector managers, its viability depends ultimately on financial support from individuals.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="42"> There are dangers that this might be jeopardised by an excessively professional, businesslike style.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9241" num="43"> Cut your coat according to the cloth may be a basic management commandment, but it will not prove an easy one for the men and women of the cloth to follow.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="5"> By PHILIP CROWE</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="6"> IT IS a curious fact that the creator of Narnia, C S Lewis, who filled his imaginary land with such an amazing assortment of creatures, had a phobia about insects.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="7"> Into a vivid paragraph describing this, 'The works, that is the trouble, all on the outside,' Lewis gratuitously drops this sentence: 'In the hive and the ant-hill we see fully realised the two things that some of us most dread for our own species: the dominance of the female and the dominance of the collective'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="8"> In spite of, or perhaps because of, this dread, Lewis was fatally attracted to extremely dominant women, but with women as with insects, he was capable of rationalising his phobias with startling clarity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="9"> He wrote a brief essay called 'Priestesses in the Church', a diatribe against the ordination of women priests.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="10"> This month, 72 years after the debate officially started, the Church of England hovers on the brink of a momentous decision.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="11"> The arguments in favour of women being ordained priests are not only clear, but overwhelming.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="12"> Discrimination against people, solely on the grounds of race or gender, is generally held to be a bad thing, which the church resists everywhere except in the church.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="13"> Men and women are equal in the sight of God, but unequal in the life of the church.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="14"> Justice for women everywhere, but not in the sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="15"> The practical arguments, too, would rapidly convince any personnel manager.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="16"> An organisation which resorts to desperate expedients to meet its core commitments, while ignoring over half its available people, must be either strange or incompetent.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="17"> Yet opposition to the ordination of women, among women as well as men, is passionate, vociferous, and deep-seated.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="18"> Of course the opposition is similar to that prejudiced resistance to women which has afflicted London clubs and company board rooms.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="19"> On the surface, it is rational: 'We couldn't possibly admit women - we have no toilets for them'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="20"> But what is going on beneath the surface?</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="21"> As with Lewis, there are undercurrents of dread.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="22"> Society in general sorted out this issue long ago.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="23"> We are, in theory at least, an equal opportunities society.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="24"> The church as usual comes lumbering up to the finishing line puffing and panting long after everyone else has gone home.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="25"> But what society states in theory, and what happens in practice, are not the same.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="26"> True, we have had our first woman prime minister.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="27"> Was she not the best man in the cabinet ? Is there any way of distinguishing, except by voice, the speeches of a female politician from those of a male?</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="28"> The language of public discourse is the language of power, the male language.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="29"> The women who get on are the women who perform best as imitation men, in a society where human beings are called Man, the only respectable God is male, and the only direction is upwards, towards success.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="30"> Female language is the language of weakness, of vulnerability, the language of fulfilment and of relationships.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="31"> No, this is not a tired piece of stereotyping.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="32"> The point is that we should all be bilingual.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="33"> The language of public discourse should be both masculine and feminine.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="34"> If the church were to ordain women to the priesthood, it would be inviting and welcoming this bilingual discourse at the very heart of its life.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="35"> The fact that it has been such a long and hard struggle may mean that the church will understand, more deeply than society, what it means to be both male and female.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="36"> But why is it such a desperate struggle?</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="37"> Where does such passionate opposition to women priests come from?</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="38"> The former Bishop of London once remarked that if he saw a woman in the sanctuary, he would want to hug her.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="39"> His predecessors would have behaved with marginally less subtlety.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="40"> There is some extraordinary correspondence dating from the 1930s, a Bishop of Durham, no less notorious for the extreme liberalism of his views than his current successor, laying down precise rules about where a woman may stand in church if she is to read the scriptures.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="41"> The sanctuary is, beyond question, out of bounds.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="42"> Social anthropologists argue persuasively that gender issues are not simply about physical differences.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="43"> They are also an indicator of social differences.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="44"> Sanction-laden rules about what constitutes appropriate behaviour are a means of identifying social boundaries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="45"> They preserve the identity of the group.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="46"> Within the church, boundaries marked by gender have contracted so much that the few which remain are invested with dreadful significance.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="47"> The last remaining preserve of the male priest is the authority to speak those most powerful words of remembrance, of forgiveness, and of blessing.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="48"> The male priest is the representative of the very tradition which gives him authority.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="49"> If the gender of the priest can be changed, nothing is sacred.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="50"> If the tradition is flouted, we no longer know who we are.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="51"> Worse still, we no longer know who God is.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="52"> The male priest, representing Jesus the man, evokes powerfully the image of the male God, and that image has dominated Christian worship and teaching for generations.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="53"> More than 100 drawings of God, done for me by children in a village primary school, contained only one hint of the feminine, a wonderfully colourful figure with two heads, the male smoking a pipe and the female a cigarette.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="54"> Just below the surface lurk questions of human sexuality.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="55"> The Christian church has maintained a tradition which holds that even an ideal sex life is inferior to no sex life at all.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="56"> This tradition tells that the ideal priest is male and celibate.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="57"> An elderly lady said recently to a woman deacon, 'You won't help with Communion, will you, when. . . you know . . . it's that time of the month'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="58"> And there is something shocking about the idea of a pregnant woman celebrating the Holy Communion.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="59"> All the rational arguments barely conceal deep and primitive fears which bear all the classic features of cultural taboo.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="60"> Earlier this year, the men in a church choir hissed at a newly-ordained woman deacon as she walked through the chancel and in to the sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="61"> She was the first woman ever to do so in that church.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="62"> Had she turned into a pillar of salt, it would have been less than they hoped for.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="63"> The sound of their hissing evoked in her a primitive kind of horror.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="64"> It is these primitive fears, these cultural taboos, which are recognised in Christian faith as 'elemental spirits' from which people are set free by the liberating truth of the gospel.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="65"> If the church decides not to ordain women as priests, it will not simply make injustice an official part of its own life.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="66"> It will also declare itself to be in bondage to primitive fears.</s>

<s docid="FT924-10442" num="67"> No doubt the Church of England would still have a great deal to say; but would it have any credibility at all?</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="10"> The case for separating the British state from its official church is best argued on its merits.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="11"> These have been considerable since. . . let us say since attendance at public worship ceased to be compulsory.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="12"> In a week in which parliament has ceded the sabbath to Mammon, by allowing virtually unrestricted shopping on the seventh day, the case seems overwhelming.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="13"> Christian ayatollahs may have been in the ascendancy in a quasi-theocratic state when Queen Elizabeth I assumed the title of Supreme Governor of the church, but that was nearly half a millennium ago.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="14"> Queen Elizabeth II may well be the last to hold this purely nominal office.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="15"> None of the above has anything to do with the personal life of the Prince of Wales.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="16"> That is an after-dinner topic - unavoidable, but not serious.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="17"> It is a phase through which we must all pass before growing up.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="18"> The national mind has been drugged by the ingestion of too many tabloids.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="19"> Give me a lightly grilled sole, a little spinach and a Havana of reasonable purity and length, and after devouring the first two I'll puff on the third while competing in scurrility with everyone else.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="20"> But that is an abuse of the spirit.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="21"> Even a long-standing agnostic like myself cannot be proud of it.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="22"> We should focus on the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="23"> First, let me clear away one further, more fundamental, distraction.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="24"> I have argued here before that the British polity would be healthier if the formal apex of power was the will of the people, protected by a declaration in a written constitution.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="25"> That would remove the opportunity open to the executive to abuse its authority by affecting to act on behalf of the monarch.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="26"> Thus democratised, the head of state could continue to wear a crown, if that is what the populace wanted.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="27"> This topic, like royal behaviour, should be detached from the thread of the argument about disestablishment.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="28"> Pause a moment, to tick off what I hope is agreed so far.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="29"> There is only one heir to the throne.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="30"> He is Prince Charles.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="31"> End of story, although not the end of gossip.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="32"> There are many churches, mosques and synagogues in Britain; only one has been so bound by history in seductive ermine that it is unable to concentrate on its true religious function, for fear of disconnection from the political process.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="33"> Some of its ministers register near panic at the prospect of being reduced to the status of priests in a minority Christian sect.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="34"> These long-standing fears must be felt all the more acutely at present.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="35"> Financial mismanagement has diminished the Church of England's earthly riches, and obliged its parish clergy to scratch around ever more piteously for fresh sources of support.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="36"> The decision to permit women to become priests has split the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="37"> Some recalcitrants are running off to Rome while others stay behind in miserable defiance, or plain confusion.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="38"> An explosive debate about disestablishment could damage this fragmented church beyond repair.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="39"> We disentanglers can wait.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="40"> Granted, the present may not be an ideal moment.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="41"> Yet the truth is that separation of church and state is proceeding in the usual English way: by fits and starts.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="42"> The prime minister, acting on behalf of the Queen, appoints the bishops - but does so from a short list prepared by the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="43"> The House of Commons, in which heathens appear to be the majority, votes on matters such as the ordination of women - but follows the general synod of the church.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="44"> The next monarch may be 'defender of the faith' but not 'supreme governor'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="45"> It is progress, but we are still stuck with 26 Anglican bishops in the House of Lords.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="46"> None of this changes the essence of the case.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="47"> That is best put as a question.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="48"> At a time when many people, particularly young people, are searching longingly for spiritual guidance, what on earth are the Anglican disciples of Jesus Christ doing in their centuries-long embrace with the descendants of Caesar?</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="49"> Surely not merely preserving their position?</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="50"> It may be that in the coming century the vacuum left by the materialism of the 20th is filled by institutions other than the Church of England.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="51"> True believers, rising above institutional concerns, should welcome that.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="52"> A more enduring future may lie in store for the world-wide Anglican communion, whose member churches were founded by missionaries who risked their lives to preach the gospel, or by British settlers in what became the white Commonwealth, or by America's Episcopalians.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="53"> There are Anglicans in India, and in Japan, and of course in the Church of the Province of South Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="54"> Most of the world's 70m Anglicans are black Africans.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="55"> This international community would be strengthened if its mother church ceased to be part of the British state.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="56"> The opposite view is expressed by Michael De-la-Noy, press officer to the archbishop of Canterbury in 1967-70.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="57"> In his recent book, The Church of England (Simon & Schuster, Pounds 16.99), Mr De-la-Noy notes that establishment 'provides links with the Foreign Office, so essential to the Church's dealings with governments overseas'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="58"> He must be right about the institution, but could be wrong about its purpose.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="59"> It would be naive to insist that that purpose, which is in essence to sustain a transcendental view of the universe, can only be served by volunteers uniting in worship.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="60"> The influence of both Islam and Christianity was expanded by the sword.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="61"> Crusades - and, we must hope, jihads - are, however, a thing of the past.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="62"> The task, for some exalted individual, some doctrine, some institution is to find 21st century ways of keeping human faith alive.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="63"> Lambeth Palace, which sits across the Thames in mock-equilibrium with the Palace of Westminster, does not seem a likely source of such inspiration.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="64"> The original 12 disciples would have found the link incomprehensible.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="65"> The C of E should float free.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3058" num="66"> It might then save itself and - who knows? - some of the rest of us .</s>
