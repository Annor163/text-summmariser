<s docid="FT941-15416" num="11"> The government has set up a probe into Mr Leakey and the KWS Service but refused to make public the terms of reference.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="12"> President Moi, who appointed Mr Leakey five years ago at the height of a grave elephant poaching and corruption crisis has remained silent.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="13"> In the past Mr Moi has often quietly backed smear campaigns against ministers and officials before sacking them.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="14"> At the heart of the row is the issue of land allocation in wildlife areas made by Mr Leakey.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="19"> Close associates and friends of Mr Leakey admit that he is abrasive and can be arrogant.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="20"> He has built up an independent and powerful fiefdom at KWS and bruised many political egos and created jealousies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="21"> Backed by the president and embraced as the darling of international conservation groups, Mr Leakey felt he was untouchable and often acted without too much consultation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-15416" num="22"> But many say he almost single-handedly restored international credibility to the Kenyan wildlife department which was tarnished throughout the 1980s with corruption, nepotism, political interference, inefficiency and allegations that leading Kenyan families were involved with poaching of ivory and rhino horn.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="11"> This is what happened after Richard E.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="12"> Leakey, world-renowned paleontologist, author and conservationist, head of the Kenya National Museums for 20 years, decided to speak out on the issue of wildlife poaching in the country's national parks:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="13"> Leakey's reputation as a scientist and museum administrator was harshly attacked in the local press.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="14"> The government reorganized the museum board behind his back, prompting him to submit his resignation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="15"> Despite being a native Kenyan and a citizen, whose younger brother serves in the Kenyan Parliament and as deputy tourism minister, Leakey was derided by one government minister as a "cheeky white" who felt that black Africans could not manage their own affairs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="16"> But in the fullness of time, Leakey's reputation and career have recovered.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="17"> Soon after his resignation, a public uproar forced the government to restore the old museum board, and he withdrew his resignation.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="18"> More recently, Leakey became head of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Management, succeeding one of his critics.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="19"> For all of that, his experiences underscore one thing: wildlife conservation in Kenya is sensitive business.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="20"> Conservation Rivalries</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="21"> Few events have laid open the rivalries between conservationists and bureaucrats -- and among the conservationists themselves -- as a scandal here over poaching and Leakey's outspokenness on the subject.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="22"> How Kenya undertakes to protect its valued wildlife has long been a tender issue, because there is little any developing country can do to combat a gang of determined poachers.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="23"> Many people here feel that the only solution is to "privatize" wildlife preserves, by establishing quasi-private companies to run existing preserves or otherwise placing them in private hands that can afford to safeguard their perimeters.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="24"> But Kenyan officials are particularly sensitive to criticism, partly because they fear the impact that negative publicity might have on the country's significant tourist trade.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="25"> "After all, most of us want to remain in the country," remarked one leading local zoologist, who was reluctant to discuss the issue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="26"> With a multiplicity of international and local wildlife clubs and funds and societies representing a variety of interests and philosophies, Kenyan conservationists, like keepers of the flame anywhere, often spend as much time sorting out their own differences as they do fighting a common foe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="27"> "Oh, yes," says Imre Loefler, a local surgeon and prominent conservationist, "there are enormous disagreements in the conservation community.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="28"> This community has various traits and prejudices.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="29"> At one extreme is the most bigoted right wing -- strictly anti-humans -- and at the other are those only interested in a few species.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="30"> They're generally employed in the tourist industry".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="31"> In few other places, moreover, are the conflicts between the needs of wildlife protection and those of the human population so sharply etched as in Kenya.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="32"> Wildlife is Kenya's greatest tourist draw, and tourism its third-largest foreign exchange earner: The 700,000 visitors expected this year will leave behind well over $350 million in foreign currency.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="33"> With coffee and tea prices locked in a long slump, tourism may be Kenya's only growth industry.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="34"> Competing With Humans</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="35"> Yet Kenya's elephants, rhinos, lions and antelope occupy land that comes at an increasing premium and for which they must compete ever more aggressively with the country's human population, which is growing faster than that of any other nation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="36"> In Narok, a farm district next to Masai Mara National Park, one of Kenya's most popular game reserves, a herd of elephants not long ago invaded a plantation of bananas and vegetables; in their haste to reach the food, they trampled a woman to death.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="37"> In Tana River district, which includes part of Tsavo East Game Reserve, 88 people have been killed by animals since 1980, according to the Department of Tourism and Wildlife.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="38"> "With growing population pressures, one has to show the politicians that setting aside preserves is economically productive, whether that involves tourism, hunting or exploitation" such as harvesting ivory, Loefler says.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="39"> "You can't tell people anymore that we're just going to do this for sentimental reasons".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="40"> Adding to the underlying tension is a racial element: The wildlife conservation community here largely comprises white expatriate Europeans and Americans, some of whom may not be fully sensitive to the competing interests of a poor and developing land.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="41"> What set all this tinder aflame was an apparent surge of poaching late last year in Kenya's national parks.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="42"> Tourists began returning from safaris in the parks, not with tales of bongo on the hoof and lions at repose yawning in the grass and trees, but of mountains of elephant carcasses, with trunks and tusks ghoulishly lopped off.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="43"> Reports reached Nairobi of poaching gangs armed with automatic weapons engaging park rangers in lengthy shoot-outs.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="44"> In November, Perez Olindo, Leakey's predecessor as director of Wildlife and Conservation Management, detailed the six-month war's casualties: six game rangers killed, nine wounded.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="45"> In the longer term, Olindo said, poaching had reduced Kenya's elephant population in 13 years from 140,000 to 22,000.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="46"> Other unofficial estimates placed the elephant population as low as 16,000.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="47"> It was into this ferment that Leakey jumped with both feet last fall.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="48"> Just after Tourism and Wildlife Minister George Muhoho called a news conference to pledge a redoubled government anti-poaching effort, Leakey called his own conference as chairman of the East African Wildlife Society.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="49"> Calling poaching "a growing national crisis" and "economic sabotage," he labeled the government's approach toward wildlife protection "lip service" and charged that high officials of the wildlife department itself were participating in poaching.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="50"> The remarks by Leakey, one of the few Kenyans of his stature to speak out, brought the poaching issue to the forefront of national and international attention.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="51"> The elder son of the late Louis Leakey, whose work at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania was critical in the study of early man, Leakey has made many important discoveries himself.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="52"> His directorship of the national museums is widely regarded as having given those institutions a preeminent position in study of prehistory.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="53"> Family's Prominent Role</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="54"> Finally, there could be few white families who have played as prominent a role as natives and citizens in Kenya's post-independence period as have the Leakeys.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="55"> Muhoho at first replied with what Kenya's leading newspaper, the Daily Nation, later disapprovingly termed a "contentious response": He called Leakey a "cheeky white".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="56"> Yet, it was not only Kenyan officials who felt Leakey had shot from the hip.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="57"> "There's no question whatsoever that he was doing a bit of grandstanding," said David Western, chairman of the governing council of the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="58"> In any event, the wildlife rangers temporarily recovered some of their morale.</s>

<s docid="LA050889-0063" num="62"> Mounds of carcasses still appear, and public concern over the situation has not abated.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="6"> To many observers, Richard Leakey's stormy departure from the Kenya Wildlife Service revealed the sinister side of Kenyan politics.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="7"> His success in saving Kenya's wildlife from the clutches of ivory poachers, and his fund-raising efforts abroad, put Leakey on a collision course with those in government who envied his independence and coveted the aid dollars flowing into KWS conservation projects.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="8"> Before Mr Leakey's appointment in 1989, Kenya's wildlife was being decimated by gangs of armed brigands who roamed the country with impunity.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="9"> Three-quarters of the elephant population and almost the entire rhino herd had been slaughtered.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="10"> Attacks on tourists were on the rise.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="11"> Mr Leakey began the new regime at KWS by sacking 1,640 staff suspected of corruption.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="12"> He re-introduced a shoot-to-kill policy against game poachers, and campaigned for an international ban on the ivory trade.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="13"> He believed Kenya's wildlife, which underpins a Dollars 350m-a-year tourist industry, could be managed in a profitable and sustainable manner.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="14"> Donors, including the World Bank and Britain's Overseas Development Agency, backed his plans by pledging Dollars 300m for KWS projects over 10 years.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="15"> To foreign donors, Mr Leakey represented the new face of public service.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="16"> He was a man who had taken over a corrupt and dispirited government department and transformed it into a dynamic parastatal, with the freedom to cut through red tape and resist political meddling.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="17"> Suddenly, in January, he came under attack for arrogance, racism and corruption.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="18"> He was told he faced a secret government probe into the workings of KWS.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="19"> Neither President Moi nor the KWS board of trustees rallied to his defence as senior government figures, led by William ole Ntimama, the minister for local government, called for his resignation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="20"> Mr Leakey believes the smear campaign was orchestrated by 'land-grabbing' politicians, whom the KWS had frustrated in their attempts to appropriate vast chunks of Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries to develop hotel resorts or mining concessions.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="21"> He left the director's post in January, was recalled by the president in March, and resigned again barely two weeks later, saying the government had placed impossible restrictions on his job.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="22"> Mr Leakey's acrymonious departure dismayed conservationists in Kenya and abroad.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="23"> It also raised alarm bells in the donor community, who began to fear their conservation grants might fall prey to political predators.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="24"> The government appears to have acknowledged their concern, for instead of naming a politician to head KWS, it appointed another white Kenyan with solid credentials in the field of conservation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="25"> David Western has a tough act to follow.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="26"> He must persuade the donor community that their conservation funds are in safe hands.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="27"> He must avoid charges of empire-building while being in control of an area the size of Northern Ireland.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="28"> And he must maintain the trust of government to be allowed to command an irregular army of game wardens, reconnaissance vehicles and surveillance aircraft.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="29"> He is also aware of the political machinations which hounded his predecessor from office, and says land-grabbing politicians will have no better luck with him.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="30"> Significantly, Mr Western obtained the reversal of two presidential directives which caused Mr Leakey to resign: the armed Wildlife Protection Unit will no longer be placed under the authority of the commissioner of police; and KWS will regain its financial autonomy from the Tourism and Wildlife Ministry.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="31"> Mr Western, however, believes that, under Mr Leakey's stewardship, KWS had laid itself open to charges that it was more concerned about animals than people.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="32"> An acute shortage of arable and grazing land, coupled with Kenya's rapid population growth, have brought communities to the borders of wildlife sanctuaries.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="33"> Elephants trample crops.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="35"> A ban on culling means that wild animals and farming communities live in increasingly uneasy coexistence.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="37"> He intends to redress the issue by focusing on the 'people side' of conservation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="38"> He wants to promote landowners' associations, and encourage them to present their proposals for community-based conservation projects.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="39"> He believes certain policies, such as the introduction of culling or hunting licenses, might be less controversial if they came from local communities.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="40"> But the bottom line is money.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="41"> Local communities, and local politicians in particular, feel they are not getting their fair share of wildlife revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT942-10464" num="42"> For Mr Western, juggling the competing financial demands of wildlife and people will be the toughest act of all.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="5"> THE PLIGHT of the African elephant arouses high passions.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="6"> Hunted down and stripped of tusks and hide by poachers, their numbers in Africa slumped from 1.2m to 600,000 in a decade until, in 1989, CITES - the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species - banned the trade in ivory.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="7"> On Monday, when the CITES' 12-day triennial conference begins in Kyoto, Japan, the wound will be re-opened.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="8"> Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Malawi want the buying and selling of ivory and other elephant products to resume in order to generate funds for protection and preservation.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="9"> They claim that effective management of native elephant herds has meant that populations are flourishing, and Zimbabwe even says culling may be needed to reduce numbers.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="10"> But conservationists fear that ending the ban will mean a new wave of poaching, which could have drastic effects on nations to the north.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="11"> The debate will be stormy.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="12"> Here, IAIN DOUGLAS-HAMILTON, who has been battling for 25 years to protect the world's largest land animal, explains the background to the meeting - and the problems that continue to make a lasting solution so difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="13"> IN SEPTEMBER 1991, two years after the CITES' ivory ban, a multi-national team in nine light aircraft criss-crossed Kenya's Tsavo national park - a wilderness of red earth, thorn bush and blue, faraway hills - looking for elephants.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="14"> Over five days, scanning every corner of the 43,000 sq km park, 6,800 live animals were spotted - up 9 per cent since the last count.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="15"> Even more important was the near-total absence of fresh carcasses.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="16"> Tsavo had been ravaged by poachers and ivory traders.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="17"> But now, morale was soaring.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="18"> Corrupt park staff had gone and the new warden was a true professional with properly-equipped forces which had confronted and defeated the intruders.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="19"> There were still plenty of armed men pouring into Kenya as the civil war in Somalia raged to the north, but the trading ban meant that ivory was devalued and not worth the risks any more.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="20"> It was a far different story only a few years earlier.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="21"> After a brief golden age for elephants in the 1950s and '60s, following the post-Second World War establishment of national parks, a wave of poaching had spread from east Africa, driven by the high ivory price and the demand for trinkets and name stamps in far-off Japan, Europe and the United States.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="22"> The poaching extended far west through the equatorial forests and south to the Zambezi river.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="23"> Flying over Uganda in 1980, after the fall of dictator Idi Amin, we found a holocaust.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="24"> Elephants lay littered on the trails like crumpled leaves, the wounded dragging their legs as they struggled to keep up with the terrified herds.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="25"> In the Murchison Falls national park, there were only 2,300 survivors from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="26"> There were gun battles in the parks as the authorities sought to deal with the aggressive, heavily-armed poachers.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="27"> Rangers were killed by Sudanese army poachers in Kidepo until a determined campaign drove them out.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="28"> Bodies of dead poachers were left to be eaten by hyenas.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="29"> The problems of Uganda were mirrored time and again elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="30"> Collecting information, with the help of scientific colleagues across Africa, we found evidence of elephants speared, trapped, poisoned, burned or shot down with automatic fire.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="31"> At times, we came close to despair at the failure of one initiative after another to stop the slaughter.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="32"> The only exceptions to the general trend were in southern Africa, south of the Zambezi.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="33"> But we feared the poaching inevitably would spread south, given the high world demand for ivory.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="34"> Finally, in 1989, the sheer weight of evidence of abuse convinced African governments and Western publics to back the ivory trade ban.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="35"> And, in general, there has been an improvement.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="36"> Contrary to predictions, it has proved policeable.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="37"> In most countries, the ivory price has dropped followed by a rapid decrease in poaching.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="38"> This is especially true in the parks and reserves of east Africa, once affected most seriously.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="39"> But at next week's CITES' conference in Kyoto, five southern African nations want to re-open trading.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="40"> It is a move opposed strongly by most African countries to the north, which believe it would destroy their elephants.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="41"> The traders sitting on stock-piles of ivory poached before the ban would benefit the most, as any legal trade would send up the price.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="42"> It would also be impossible to prevent the mixing of legal and illegal stocks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="43"> A possible compromise would be for the southern African countries to agree not to trade in ivory and to confine trade to meat and skins; but there are fears this would not be sufficiently binding.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="44"> And yet, the southern African countries, by giving up ivory sales over the past two years, have borne some of the cost of keeping elephants alive elsewhere in Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="45"> Their altruistic action has saved heavier costs in human and elephant lives, and money, that would have been incurred by nations to the north.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="46"> But for northern countries - in particular, Kenya - keeping the ivory ban is a matter of economic survival.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="47"> There is no way it could cope with another surge in poaching.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="48"> Despite Kenya and Zimbabwe being at either end of the spectrum, they have common interests.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="49"> Both believe the way forward will include an economic programme to make wildlife self-sustaining.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="50"> Zimbabwe, with its 'camp-fire' programme, has pioneered projects to bring money to local people from tourism, hunting and cropping exercises.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="51"> Kenya has made great strides in doubling its wildlife-based tourist revenues, although this is being damaged at present by bandit attacks on visitors to game reserves.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="52"> At the heart of the problem is a difference in philosophy between the protectionist and utilisation lobbies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="53"> The arguments have been bitter at times and represent a real clash of ideas.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="54"> The tragedy has been that conservationists on either side of the ivory divide have fought each other rather than the illegal traders who were the real enemy.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="55"> On the other hand, the matter of culling has now clouded the argument.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="56"> Although it is a repellent business, no one has yet come up with a solution for over-population of elephants - something that is becoming an issue as numbers grow.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="57"> And whether you like it or not, culling is a sovereign right of each country with elephants.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="58"> But a recent meeting of African elephant range states at the United Nations Environment Programme revealed a distinctly encouraging mood.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="59"> There is a growing sense of collaboration between African states and a growing willingness on the part of major donors, such as the US, the European Community and its individual member-states, to fund elephant programmes within their aid packages.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="60"> A united African initiative to resolve the thorny question of the ivory trade would be better than any Western-led solution, however well-intentioned.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="61"> An African compromise which keeps the ivory trade shut indefinitely would be worth the price of some nations selling skins from properly-controlled culling operations.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="62"> Ultimately, the fate of elephants lies in the hands of the African peoples themselves.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="63"> Iain Douglas-Hamilton is adviser to the European Commission on its elephant survey and conservation programme.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="64"> He has also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and for the New York Zoological Society.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6003" num="65"> Together with his wife, Oira, he has written the book Battle for the Elephants (Doubleday, Pounds 17.99).</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="6"> NO ISSUE divides Africa from the first world more strongly than the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="7"> While the west worries about the endangered black rhino and loss of bio-diversity, most Africans are too exhausted from the daily struggle to find fuel and water to care about the destruction of their environment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="8"> The priorities of each seem irreconcilable, and yet, they need not be.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="9"> What is needed is a greater awareness in the industrialised world of how its policies exacerbate Africa's environmental crisis.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="10"> And African governments need to place greater emphasis on combatting the extreme poverty which is a cause, as well as a result, of environmental degradation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="11"> There is little time to reverse the damage.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="12"> At current growth rates, Sub-Saharan Africa's population of 600m will double in 22 years.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="13"> The World Bank estimates the growth rate will decline from the present 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent at the end of the decade, as Aids takes its toll and family planning becomes more widespread.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="14"> However, even this decline will not be enough to prevent the population doubling early in the next century.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="15"> Already, women in the Sahel and many parts of east Africa walk 15km each day to gather a bundle of firewood.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="16"> In a few years, there will be more mouths to feed and less wood to burn.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="17"> Over-cultivation and over-grazing are transforming much of the continent into a vast wasteland: an area twice the size of India, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), is under direct threat of desertification.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="18"> In addition, Africa is losing 2.7m hectares of woodlands every year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="19"> In most countries, forests are disappearing because people need land for farming, not wood to burn.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="20"> When famine sweeps across Africa, the west calls it a natural disaster and spends billions of dollars in emergency food relief.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="21"> But Africa's hunger is not simply a question of crop failure.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="22"> In 1985, five out of six nations on a United Nations list of famine-afflicted countries were also racked by civil war.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="23"> In Ethiopia, Chad, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, it was difficult to distinguish between drought-related famine and war-induced starvation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="24"> 'For the past 20 years, civil strife has indirectly wreaked as much devastation on the environment as any other cause in Africa,' argues Dr Roger Batty, an Oxford historian and consultant at UNEP.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="25"> He believes western powers have been culpable of fuelling conflict by arming their client states on the continent.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="26"> With the end of the cold war, however, superpower interest in conducting wars-by-proxy on the continent has evaporated, and it is hoped that the level of military aid to African governments will also fall.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="27"> Environmental degradation can also add to the pressures from which conflict emerges.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="28"> 'The next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile, not politics,' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, now the UN secretary-general, warned in 1985.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="29"> The Nile basin touches on nine other countries, reaching as far south as Tanzania and Zaire.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="30"> All upstream nations are keen to extend land under irrigation by tapping Egypt's only source of water.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="31"> 'Without political imagination,' Mr Boutros Ghali continued, 'Egypt will become a new Bangladesh fraught with drought and famine - but with one difference.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="32"> This Bangladesh will be on the shores of the Mediterranean, half-an-hour by jet from the rich people in the north'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="33"> Already, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees, there are 5m displaced people on the continent.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="34"> To call them refugees would be a misnomer, for most will never be able to return to their homes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="35"> Many are fleeing land too degraded to support them.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="36"> Others seek refuge from civil war, government repression, ethnic conflict, or simply the desperate poverty of rural areas.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="37"> But up to now, the west has preferred to focus on endangered animals, rather than endangered humans.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="38"> The expulsion of Maasai pastoralists from 4,800 square miles of traditional grazing land which became the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania was one of the first important battles fought by western conservationists in Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="39"> All over the continent, 'experts' imposed the theory that wildlife and people should be separated.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="40"> This principle is now being challenged.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="41"> 'It is hard to imagine that 150,000 tourists are not causing greater environmental damage and disturbing wildlife far more than 2,000 Maasai ever did,' says Mr Raymond Bonner, a US journalist and author of At the Hand of Man: Peril and Hope for Africa's Wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="42"> New solutions are required which marry the needs of local people to those of the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="43"> In Luwangwa, Zambia, hunting rights are auctioned among safari companies and the revenues are channelled to the local tribes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="44"> As a result, villagers have started supporting the national parks service and set up security committees to prevent poachers entering into their areas.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="45"> The number of poached carcasses of elephants and black rhinos in Luwangwa fell by 90 per cent between 1985 and 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="46"> The lesson to be learned is that Africa needs an economic incentive to protect its wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="47"> But western institutions - be they tourist or pharmaceutical companies - are often reluctant to pay the price.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="48"> Far more worrying than the endangered black rhino are Africa's disappearing insects and plants - species that could hold the cure for Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="49"> Already, Africa has destroyed 65 per cent of its original wildlife habitats.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="50"> Concerns about the staggering loss of bio-diversity are not exaggerated.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="51"> A substance discovered in the rosy periwinkle, a species unique to Madagascar, has quadrupled the survival rate for children suffering from leukemia.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="52"> Worldwide sales of the rosy periwinkle drug now earn more than Dollars 100m a year, but not a cent has accrued to Madagascar in compensation for preserving the plant's habitat.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="53"> A growing number of ecologists now argue that the best way of persuading African nations to protect their bio-diversity is by paying them to leave their natural resources intact.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="54"> What is found in Africa may be needed in Europe and the rest of the developed world.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="55"> Paper mills in the US and Japan, for example, are experimenting with an African plant, Kenaf, a relative of jute, which produces five times more pulp than the average tree.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="56"> After 30 years of investigations, the US Department of Agriculture has singled out Kenaf as the most promising substitute to produce tree-free paper.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="57"> It is an annual crop, whereas man-made forests require up to 60 years in the northern hemisphere to reach maturity.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="58"> US newspapers which have tested Kenaf newsprint report that it is brighter, reproduces better pictures, and uses less ink, which does not stain hands.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="59"> Africa's environmental problems are often portrayed in doomsday tones.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="60"> In reality, they are neither insoluble nor insurmountable.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="61"> What is needed is a radical reassessment of the value the industrialised world places on Africa's environmental health.</s>

<s docid="FT933-5757" num="62"> It is an issue the west ignores at its peril.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="6"> Zibane Mazibuko illustrates one of Africa's rarest cliches: he is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="7"> Not long ago, this 33-year-old Zulu with broken teeth and ragged clothes, who speaks seldom and smiles less, was poaching game from the Phinda Resource Reserve in South Africa's Natal province.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="8"> Today, he says his future depends on keeping the animals alive: for they attract the tourists who bring scarce cash to this forgotten corner of rural Zululand.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="9"> Thanks to them, Mazibuko has landed a contract to make 150,000 bricks for the new Phinda game lodge; he reckons he can earn R1,800 (Pounds 370) a month from his new business, far more than he could bag as a poacher.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="10"> The owners of Phinda, the South African-based Conservation Corporation, could not have paid for a better advertisement for their philosophy of wildlife conservation - a people-based approach to conservation, which is slowly gaining ground in Africa as game reserves come under ever greater threat from hungry, poor and angry local populations.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="12"> He and his colleagues - brothers Dave and John Varty, who have already made a fortune from their brand of ethically-sound conservation - believe they have found a model to guarantee the survival of wildlife in Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="13"> 'The old notion of a game reserve where you put up a fence and chuck the people out is flawed,' says Leo-Smith.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="14"> 'You need to make sure the cash flows through that fence'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="15"> Local people must share not only the natural resources of the reserve - they must be allowed to gather wood for cooking, grasses for thatching, palm sap for wine-making and indigenous herbs for use by witch-doctors - but they must benefit from its development.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="16"> 'We're aiming to use the economic 'exciter' of the lodge to attract (development and investment) funds, and make sure they get circulated locally so that local people understand that their future is invested with us - and that gives them an interest in conservation,' Leo-Smith concludes.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="17"> In other words, they intend to turn all the poachers into honorary gamekeepers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="18"> The alternative, says Leo-Smith, is untenable: to live in a perpetual state of siege, keeping poachers out by force (the status quo in most other African reserves).</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="19"> So the motivation for Phinda is more practical than ethical: and therein lies its best chance of success.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="20"> For Leo-Smith and the Vartys practise a capitalist approach to conservation.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="21"> They believe conservation can and must be made to pay - especially in South Africa, where a new black government will probably divert subsidies from state reserves (widely viewed as white playgrounds) to fund black social development.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="22"> Conservation Corp has raised R83m in equity funds, 40 per cent of it from foreign investors such as Hambros Bank and the Getty family trusts, to invest in Africa's undervalued wildlife assets, which they argue can be exploited to produce returns which are attractive and ethically sound.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="23"> That means making not only traditional 'social investments' in surrounding communities - building schools, clinics and housing for employees - but, more importantly, providing venture capital for local businesses which must prove commercially viable to survive.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="24"> Phinda's managers know charity is a poor substitute for sustainable development: they will provide management training, marketing advice, cheap loans, equity where necessary - but the entrepreneurial drive must come from the community.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="25"> Mazibuko, the brickmaker, is only one of Conservation Corp's pilot entrepreneurs.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="26"> When he was caught poaching, he was so poor he could not pay the fine imposed by the local tribal court: one cow, the currency of rural Zulu society.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="27"> So he worked off his sentence making bricks for the reserve.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="28"> Later, Phinda set him up as an independent brickmaker, with two rudimentary moulding machines and a contract for the new lodge.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="29"> Phinda provides the raw materials, and passes all the profit (2 cents per brick) along to Mazibuko, after a 1 cent per brick repayment on the machinery.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="30"> He pays his labourers out of profits and dreams of expansion once the lodge is built.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="31"> Phinda gets bricks over a third cheaper than from commercial suppliers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="32"> Not far from Mazibuko's brickworks, Thomas Nkomo - another reformed poacher -makes charcoal according to a traditional African method.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="33"> Where before he stole wood from the reserve, now he clears unwanted bush for Phinda, and uses it to build a six-foot high circular pyre.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="34"> The pyre smoulders for 17 days, yielding 800 5kg bags of highly marketable 'environmentally-friendly' charcoal.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="35"> Nkomo's equity partner, a Phinda game ranger, sells the charcoal for R3.40 per bag.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="36"> It costs R1.20 to produce, with costs held down further by the fact that Nkomo's labour is paid through a drought relief scheme funded by a local development agency.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="37"> But if charcoal and brickmaking are at least marginally viable, Phinda's Sondela entertainment centre could prove really lucrative.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="38"> Phinda sold 168 R100 shares in Sondela to finance (with the help of a R25,000 interest-free loan) a centre where, for a nominal fee, employees can enjoy soccer, karate, body building and ballroom dancing, buy take-away food and drinks and have their photo taken by a local photographer.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="39"> Phinda aims to ensure that Sondela shares pay an 80 to 100 per cent annual dividend, to popularise the idea of share ownership in a hostile environment; loan repayments will be deferred until the project makes sufficient profit.</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="40"> Leo-Smith admits that Phinda does not put large amounts of its own money into these schemes, though he says the reserve supports 10 per cent of the local population (directly or indirectly).</s>

<s docid="FT932-12511" num="41"> But Africa is littered with large and expensive development schemes which, inevitably, fail; spending small sums well, on commercially viable development - the Phinda method - is far more difficult than pouring shareholder funds into charity projects which do more for the donor's self-image than for the recipient's prosperity.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="6"> THE CONVOY giving chase through the African bush was an assortment of pick-ups, a Land Rover and trucks all being directed by a crackled message from a scout helicopter, call sign Z-HOT.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="7"> Trackers had scoured the earth for clues and reported to the helicopter.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="8"> When the animal came within 30m of the chopper - the range of the full-bore air pressure rifle on board - it was shot.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="9"> In many cases, mothers and their young were felled within metres of each other; sometimes the baby panicked, ran off and collapsed as far as a mile from where its mother lay.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="10"> Rhino hunting in Zimbabwe has found new impetus.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="11"> But take heart - these are hunts to save the lives of a vanishing species, performed by vets using sleep-inducing darts, not the AKs of the poachers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="12"> Poaching has wiped out all but - at an optimistic estimate - 500 of Zimbabwe's rhinos; four years ago there were more than 2,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="13"> The hunter's aim in both cases is the same: to remove the rhino's horn.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="14"> A successful poacher will get less than Pounds 100 for the horn, which is then sold for as much as Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 13,000) in the Far East where it is thought to enhance sexual potency, or to Yemen to be made into highly prized dagger handles.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="15"> A successful vet will hope that the dehorned rhino has been given a stay of execution.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="16"> Zimbabwe has been dehorning its rhino population for a year, following the example of Namibia.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="17"> Mark Atkinson, a vet for Zimbabwe's National Parks working almost exclusively on the dehorning programme, believes about 60 per cent of Zimbabwe's rhino population has been dehorned.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="18"> He stresses that the programme is not a long-term solution to save the rhino, but prefers to call it 'crisis management'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="19"> In other words, the vets are trying to give the rhinos a respite from poachers so that the species can build its numbers up to a comfortable level.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="20"> By dehorning the few left, the species may survive.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="21"> It costs between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,000 to dehorn one rhino.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="22"> It can also take several days to track one animal, and a dozen or more burly men to heave the captured rhino into a crate for transportation to a safer area.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="23"> With no dedicated rhino unit in Zimbabwe, the conservationists are desperate for any help they can get.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="24"> The British Army's Mozambique Training Team, based in the east of the country, has been lending radios, trucks and muscle to Zimbabwe's effort.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="25"> They helped to move seven rhinos at Lake Kyle which had been stranded when the rains came, and took part in a three-week operation to dehorn about 60 animals in the Bushey Park area.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="26"> Under Lt Col Robert Martin, officers and senior NCOs from BMATT (British Military Advisory and Training Team) joined the veterinarian team and trackers at a private game lodge about three hours south of Harare.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="27"> The vets particularly wanted help in dehorning and moving the white rhinos, which are more susceptible to stress than black ones.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="28"> Once the trackers and vets have sighted and shot a rhino, the convoy of trucks with its winches and crates rushed to where the animal lay.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="29"> A hood was placed over the rhino's head to shield its eyes and ears.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="30"> The removal of the horn takes only a few minutes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="31"> Chainsaws cut through it as easily as through a small tree; the vet takes longer to shape the stump so that it will not become ingrown.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="32"> Rhino horns regrow at an average of 8cm a year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="33"> Small slivers of horn are barely distinguishable from a human fingernail.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="34"> Part of the exercise was to move the rhinos to a safer area - private gameparks or farms.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="35"> A truck winched down a crate to lie with its open door facing the rhino and a rope was tied around the animal's huge snout.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="36"> About eight soldiers took up positions around the animal to push it into the crate, while as many again were at the back of the crate ready to heave on the rope and pull the rhino in.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="37"> Rather than shift two to three tons of deadweight, the animal was revived with a sleeping drug antidote and water was poured into its ear to wake it.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="38"> As soon as it started moving, the heaving and pushing began until the door of the crate was closed on a very irate and confused beast.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="39"> The crate was then winched on to the truck and the rhinos driven to a secret location where they are released into a corral and monitored before being taken to a safe area.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="40"> There are so few rhinos left that the vets keep detailed identification details of each one they catch.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="41"> As well as nicks cut out of their ears, age, condition and distinguishing marks being noted, 'mug shots' are taken.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="42"> Seven rhinos were dehorned that weekend - one calf, at four to six months old, had no horn to speak of.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="43"> Euan Anderson, a Zimbabwean vet, believes that since the dehorning programme started in Zimbabwe, four to five dehorned rhinos have been killed by poachers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="44"> This may be because when poachers have spent several days following rhino spoor they may kill the animal to cut off its ears as proof to their paymasters, or it may simply be that the poachers were not aware until after the shooting that the rhino they had been following was carrying nothing of value.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="45"> To combat the latter, Zimbabwe has been advertising its dehorning programme on Zambian television - it is believed that the poachers come from Zambia, though some have hinted that the worst culprits are much closer to the Zimbabwe parks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="46"> Studies are in progress in Namibia and Zimbabwe to determine the long-term effect on the rhino's behaviour of having its horn removed.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="47"> Euan Anderson believes that the rhino is not greatly affected.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="48"> Even in self defence, as he says, if a three-ton beast charges towards impact at full speed, it does not much matter whether it has a horn or not.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="49"> More than one of the officers involved in the rescue observed that 'Civvies would pay a fortune to do this'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="50"> Indeed, I felt privileged to be there to see the magnificent animals sleeping, touch their skin that feels like slightly spongy granite and stroke their ears, which on black rhinos are fringed with long silky black hairs.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="51"> Zimbabwe had, in fact, investigated the possibility of selling 'rhino hunting', particularly to the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="52"> The idea was that for around Dollars 30,000 a hunter would be given the facilities to track and dart a rhino, leaving the vets to do the rest, and take home the horn as a souvenir.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="53"> However, the proposal met with outcry and resistance in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="54"> Another idea that the vets approve of is to flood the market with the huge stockpile of legally-removed rhino horn, force down the market price and thus make poaching unviable.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="55"> They stipulate, however, that the revenues should be ploughed back into rhino conservation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="56"> Bushmen and vets in Zimbabwe are passionate in their commitment in saving the rhino from extinction.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="57"> While Mark Atkinson was busy with the chainsaw, a vet from the US whispered: 'Your gardeners in England earn more than he does'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="58"> Earlier, on a walking safari deep in the bush of Hwange National Park, I was nervously quizzing my armed guide about the procedure should an animal charge (do not shoot until it is 10 feet away and approaching).</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="59"> And what if your party of tourists should be charged by a rhino? I asked.</s>

<s docid="FT933-2396" num="60"> He shrugged.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="7"> I am at Rekero Farm, under the crest of Kipeleo hill, in the north-western part of Kenya's Masai Mara conservation area, watching elephants drinking at a water-hole which is fed by a year-round spring.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="8"> The elephants snort and push, and spray themselves with dust.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="9"> I arrived from London yesterday and was transferred at once to Nairobi's smaller airport where I caught a charter flight to an airstrip in the Mara.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="13"> Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, admits that the back streets of Nairobi, where lynchings are commonplace, some by necklacing, are now no safer than the back streets of Miami, and that the city's vice and violence have played a role in the decline in Kenyan tourism.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="14"> Ron Beaton, who runs Rekero Farm with Pauline, his wife, says: 'Staying overnight in Nairobi is a complete waste of time.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="15"> It used to be a fun city; now it's a den of iniquity'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="16"> So to hell with Nairobi.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="35"> They virtually ignored the vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="36"> First we saw two males, walking slowly across the plain, their cheeks bloodied from breakfast.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="37"> Then a female with a cub (the only survivor of three).</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="38"> And then a female with two cubs, barely four weeks old, vulnerable and mewling.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="39"> When they skittered away, the female called to them anxiously.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="40"> Day 2, 6pm: I am sitting alone on Rekero's veranda.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="41"> The others have gone for a walk, heedless of gathering lion and of other unspeakable dangers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="42"> I am flipping through the pages of African Hunter, a dinosaur of a tome even when it was published in 1975.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="43"> It is a reverential guide to the business of slaughtering wildlife by a man, James Mellon, who had shot approximately 450 African game animals.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="44"> In Chapter II, in a section about Tanzania, Mellon discusses methodology: 'Leopard occur virtually everywhere in Tanzania and can be attracted to dead bait without much difficulty.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="45"> Many huge old toms have been taken in the north along the korongos (dry watercourses) of Masailand, but with luck a trophy cat can be shot almost anywhere.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="46"> Where circumstances permit, leopard can sometimes be drawn out of thick cover by beaters and shot on the run with 00 buckshot.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="47"> But baiting in trees with putrid carcases is usually more successful'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="48"> Today, Richard Leakey says that Kenya's conservation efforts are producing good results.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="49"> Nearly 28,000 square miles are protected areas.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="50"> In the past two years Kenya has attracted more than Dollars 150m (Pounds 99.3m) in outside aid to spend on wildlife conservation and the necessary infrastructure.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="51"> 'It is often claimed,' he says, 'that in Kenya more and more tourists are clustering round fewer and fewer animals.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="52"> Yet of 52 national parks and reserves, only seven are accessible to mass tourism.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="53"> 'Our security is excellent.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="54"> We have 900 armed men, plus good surveillance and intelligence.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="55"> In general, the standard of safety for tourists in our parks is good, and commercial poaching has been reduced virtually to zero.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="56"> 'One of the biggest problems now is destruction of crops by elephants.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="57"> We are losing 50-60 elephants a year - no more than 10 in the national parks - as a result of attacks by villagers, compared with the thousands being lost previously.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="58"> 'Kenya is firmly opposed to any renewal of trade in ivory and rhino horn for at least five years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="59"> If trade in ivory were to restart in any part of Africa, the black market would start again and we would face renewed serious security problems in our national parks.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="60"> 'Numbers? Kenya's black rhino population is certainly now 400-450, compared with 300-350 four years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="61"> There are 80 white rhino, which are not indigenous, mostly on private land, and about 26,000 elephants, compared with a low of possibly 18,000'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="62"> Day 3, 4pm: Now I am at Ol Donyo Wuas - it means spotted hills in Masai - more than 200 miles south-east of the Mara, in the foothills of the Chyulu hills which run between Amboseli and Tsavo national parks.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="63"> This is supremely beautiful country: semi-arid, with a short-grass plain stretching to the horizon on which, 45 miles away, Mt Kilimanjaro is propped.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="64"> Annual rainfall hereabouts: 20 inches annually.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="65"> The nearest source of water: a village 23 miles away.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="66"> Ol Donyo Wuas is owned and run by Richard Bonham, a buccaneering bachelor - he is a qualified commercial pilot - who specialises in unusual safaris, including walking-and-boating adventures from his camp on the Rufiji river in Selous game reserve, southern Tanzania.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="67"> Accommodation at Ol Donyo Wuas is in four comfortable cottages, limiting guests to a maximum of eight.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="68"> Activities available include game drives and walks, horse riding, horse safaris (you stay in camps each night) and bird shooting (July to October).</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="69"> Because of the dryness there is less game here than in the Mara, but there is still quite enough.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="70"> Unsurprisingly, Bonham rates the location of his home one of the most startling in Kenya.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="71"> He discovered it from the air.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="72"> Like Ron Beaton in the Mara, Bonham works closely with the local Masai, who view him as a friend and from whom he rents his land.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="73"> I asked Bonham what he did to help the Masai, beyond his role as an employer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="74"> He said: 'I represent them on a wildlife committee; run a cropping programme; have set up a women's workshop, which I use as a forum for wildlife education; have established a trust which pays for wildlife scholarships and for schoolbooks.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="75"> And if someone gets mauled by animals, I try to cover the cost'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="76"> A year ago he was asked to rescue a 17-year-old Masai who had been badly mauled on a lion hunt.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="77"> The lion had killed a cow, so a dozen warriors hunted it.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="78"> Three speared it; then the 17-year-old was mauled.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="79"> Bonham rescued him and flew him to the best hospital in Nairobi which patched him up.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="80"> Medical bills alone ran to Dollars 1,500.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="81"> The warrior recovered; now he is a herder.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="82"> A Masai lion-hunt must be a sight-and-a-half.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="83"> The warriors run the beast down - stamina is not its forte - and are armed only with spears.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="84"> The most courageous warrior is the one who grabs the lion's tail and holds on to it.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="85"> Usually the warriors are juiced-up on a decoction of the bark of acacia nilotica, which acts as a powerful stimulant.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="86"> It is a fine plant, the acacia.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="87"> Other members of the subfamily are used by medicine men for treating diarrhoea, intestinal worms, itchy rash, female sterility, snake bite, malaria, bubonic plague, bleeding, skin eruptions, brain infections, swellings, and head or body sores.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="88"> Day 4, 5pm: For a final dose of painkiller I have travelled, via Nairobi, to the comfortable tented camp on Funzi Island, 40 miles south of Mombasa, where the pleasant mindless life of small tropical islands anywhere is abundantly in evidence: fishing, goggling, swimming, or idling through the mangroves.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="89"> In an hour's time I start my return trek to London.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="90"> It gets harder every time.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="91"> Michael Thompson-Noel's trip was organised by Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="92"> The company's new brochure is published next week: 8 Comeragh Road, London W14 9HP, tel: 071-381 8638, fax: 071-381 0836.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="93"> There is a 15-day 'Homes of Kenya' holiday in the new brochure which takes in Ol Donyo Wuas, Rekero Farm and Funzi Island, plus Sangare Ranch in the foothills of the Aberdares.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="94"> Based on four people travelling together, the price is Pounds 2,795 per person (Jan-Nov) or Pounds 2,930 (Dec).</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="95"> However, Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions will put together almost any itinerary you want, for Kenya or elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT934-12959" num="96"> Details of other visits to Kenyan homesteads can be had from Ron Beaton: Off the Beaton Track, PO Box 14398, Nairobi, tel: 506139/502491.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="6"> It takes an unconventional man to rescue a nation's wildlife from the clutches of ivory poachers, smuggling syndicates and real estate barons.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="7"> But last month, Richard Leakey broke with all convention by doing something unheard of in Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="8"> He resigned from a government post on a point of principle, and he did so publicly, challenging the wisdom of new presidential directives on wildlife management in Kenya.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="9"> Leakey's stormy exit from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) dismayed conservationists at home and abroad.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="10"> It has also shaken the Kenyan establishment, which had been trying to project a cleaner international image after the corruption scandals of recent years.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="11"> To foreign donors, Leakey represented the new face of public service in Kenya.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="12"> He was a man who had taken over a corrupt and dispirited government department in 1989 and transformed it into a dynamic entity, with the freedom to cut through red tape and resist political interference.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="13"> Leakey sacked 1,640 staff, re-introduced a shoot-to-kill policy against game poachers, and campaigned for an international ban on ivory.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="14"> Pictures of President Daniel arap Moi setting fire to pyres of captured elephant tusks broadcast to the world Kenya's renewed commitment to the protection of wild animals.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="15"> Leakey believed Kenya's rich wildlife, which underpins a tourist industry worth Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m) a year, could be managed in a profitable and sustainable manner.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="16"> Donors, including the World Bank and Britain's Overseas Development Agency, backed his plans by pledging Dollars 300m for KWS projects over the next 10 years.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="17"> Leakey's acrimonious departure has left Moi's government with a public relations disaster.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="18"> Noah Katana Ngala, the tourism and wildlife minister, called Leakey's resignation a 'criminal act by a senior civil servant'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="19"> Donors must unravel a knottier issue: they must decide whether the funds pledged for conservation are safe from political predators.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="20"> The omens are not good.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="21"> Over the past four years, Leakey says, he withstood the attempts of 'land-grabbing' politicians to appropriate chunks of Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries to develop hotels or mining concessions.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="22"> He believes their failure led to a smear campaign.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="23"> In January, Leakey stood accused of racism, arrogance and corruption, and he faced a secret government probe into the workings of KWS.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="24"> He left his post in January, was recalled by the president in March, and resigned again two weeks later, saying the government had placed impossible restrictions on the director's job.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="25"> He cited only two of the new directives.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="26"> Armed rangers of KWS anti-poaching units were to be placed under the authority of the Commissioner of Police.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="27"> 'I foresaw problems,' Leakey says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="28"> 'If you have two units carrying arms, patrolling an area the size of Northern Ireland, who is the boss'?</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="29"> Leakey also says he was ordered to spend 75 per cent of KWS resources outside national parks, on the novel reasoning that three-quarters of Kenya's animals live outside protected areas.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="30"> 'Our aim was to manage wildlife in key tourist destinations because tourism is the biggest foreign exchange earner in Kenya,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="31"> Leakey concluded that the KWS dream of a 'self-financing, efficient, and effective, publicly owned, but independent conservation authority' was not viable under the new directives.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="32"> However, Hilary Ng'weno, chairman of the KWS board of trustees, insists there has been no change in KWS policy.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="33"> He says the board is discussing the recommendations of the government's probe committee - more than 100 of them -not all of which might prove feasible.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="34"> Ng'weno does not appear to lament Leakey's departure.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="35"> The chairman conspicuously failed to come to Leakey's defence when he was under attack for racism and indifference to the needs of communities bordering game reserves.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="36"> 'If one man wants to take credit for everything KWS does, he should be prepared to take the blame for its failures,' Ng'weno says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="37"> The rift between the two men appears to have become deeper after an air crash in September which cost Leakey both his legs.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="38"> Ng'weno says the board played a more active role during Leakey's convalescence abroad.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="39"> They were unhappy with the high salaries of certain senior managers, who nevertheless appeared unable to act without their mentor.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="40"> 'Leakey's stewardship was faulty in that it didn't distinguish the captain from the ship,' Ng'weno says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="41"> Yet this fusion of identity worked to the government's advantage while Leakey was fund-raising abroad.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="42"> With Dollars 300m pledged towards conservation in Kenya, it appears that Leakey had outlived his use.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="43"> Like others before him, he was discarded by Moi.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="44"> The World Bank, which had earmarked Dollars 60m for wildlife management in Kenya, is concerned about the upheaval at KWS.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="45"> 'We felt the projects were progressing well under Leakey's stewardship,' says Agi Kiss, a World Bank official.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="46"> It is, however, difficult for donors to side openly with Leakey, a white Kenyan with 25 years of public service, without incurring charges of favouritism or racial bias.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="47"> Kenyans are sensitive to statements that might imply that black Africans are more susceptible to corruption or ineptitude than whites.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="48"> Leakey's successor, however, is a white Kenyan.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="49"> David Western has solid credentials in the field of conservation and is reported to be on good terms with William ole Ntimama, the minister for local government who led the attacks against Leakey.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="50"> Conservation will be the least of Western's worries at KWS.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="51"> New policies are needed to curb the growing conflict between people living and farming near sanctuary areas and the wildlife - a need Leakey admits he was slow to address.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="52"> Local councils, starved of central government funds and short of patronage, are also eager to wrestle game park revenues from KWS - gate fees alone earn Dollars 1m a month.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="53"> Western, who inherits an army of game wardens, vehicles and surveillance aircraft, will have to avoid the charges of empire-building that hounded his predecessor from office.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="54"> 'Will the new director be able to resist the political pressures on KWS'? asks Leakey.</s>

<s docid="FT942-17238" num="55"> He wishes him luck.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="11"> Officials seized 980 elephant tusks, weighing about seven tons and valued at nearly $2 million, in what they believe was Africa's biggest haul of illegal ivory.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="15"> "These tusks came from more than 500 elephants, but we believe most of them were from animals killed in countries either to the north or the northeast of us," Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Department of Nature Conservation, told Reuters.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="17"> Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South African administrator-general of Namibia, Louis Pienaar, said: "It was with the assistance of the South African police that the police in Namibia were able to achieve this result".</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="18"> Environmentalists say ivory is smuggled from Angola, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe by way of Namibia or Botswana.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="19"> It is then shipped to Taiwan and Hong Kong for processing.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="20"> Some of the men detained in the raid could face 10 years in jail under penalties that have been tightened since the latest poaching spate began.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="21"> Poaching has increased this year since the number of South African forces in Namibia was reduced under the U.N. independence plan for the huge desert territory, which had been ruled by Pretoria since World War I.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="22"> Since July only 1,500 South Africa troops have remained in Namibia, confined to two bases in the north under the U.N. plan.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="28"> The area on either side of the river teems with elephants and other game, now threatened by poachers.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="29"> Some of the seized elephant tusks were huge, weighing as much as 80 pounds, while others were tiny, taken from baby elephants.</s>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="30"> Police also seized 14 rhinoceros horns and a few hippopotamus teeth.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA100789-0152" num="31"> Conservationists fear that one of Namibia's most precious resources, its abundant wildlife and especially its threatened black rhinoceros, faces a major menace from poaching.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="6"> When the elephant was voted the world's most popular animal, you can bet the people of Hurungwe district in northern Zimbabwe were not consulted.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="7"> Every year, they live in fear of elephants trampling through fields of maize that took months to prepare and tend.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="8"> One night's feast for an elephant can wipe out an entire year's harvest.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="9"> Homes might be wrecked if situated in the animals' paths.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="10"> Children and adults are injured and sometimes killed.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="11"> Why, then, are villagers thinking of constructing water dams and putting down salt to encourage elephants into their area?</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="12"> Why are they discouraging illegal settlers so that their land might be used instead by elephants?</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="13"> The answer lies in a novel programme which is giving economic value to elephants and other wildlife on Zimbabwe's communal lands.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="14"> Under Campfire (Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources), rural communities are managing to make money from animals which until recently were poached as pests.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="15"> The programme is simultaneously encouraging economic development and a conservation ethos in rural areas.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="16"> Campfire works by linking cash with conservation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="17"> Until recently, rural communities were not allowed to make any use of wildlife on their lands - poaching was common, either for food or to stop animals destroying crops and endangering people.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="18"> Now, districts accepted into the programme are allowed to shoot a certain number of animals every year, for sale either as meat or safari trophies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="19"> The programme - run by the government and conservation organisations - gives rural communities a choice.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="20"> They can shoot an animal that is damaging crops and sell its meat, earning, for example, about Pounds 1,600 for an elephant; or they can save the quota for safari hunting, where an elephant will earn the community Pounds 4,000-Pounds 6,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="21"> A typical annual wildlife quota per district might include a variety of wildlife, such as seven elephants, 20 buffalo and 20 baboons.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="22"> Campfire is creating an additional source of income for subsistence farmers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="23"> Last year, eight districts earned about Pounds 350,000 from safari hunting - mostly from Americans keen to collect an elephant trophy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="24"> Participating communities decide whether to invest the money in community projects - such as schools, dams or grinding mills - or divide it among households for personal use.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="25"> In one ward, households earned Pounds 60 each from Campfire last year - a welcome addition to the average annual income of about Pounds 80.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="26"> The programme is also encouraging the spread of business skills.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="27"> Local Campfire committees are going into partnership with well-established safari operators to market their quotas; community investments are creating small-scale industries such as the grinding mills and bee-keeping; other tourist ventures are under way, such as hiking and photographic safaris.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="28"> Cash and conservation are an attractive couple, says Lovemore Katena, a ward councillor in Hurungwe district.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="29"> 'The best thing about Campfire is that we are learning to manage our resources and we benefit from them'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="30"> The conservation benefits are becoming clear.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="31"> Villagers involved are actively discouraging wildlife poaching, confiscating snares, reporting poaching incidents and guarding against bush fires which are used to flush out animals but also destroy vegetation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="32"> They discourage illegal settlement and illegal gold panning, which contribute to the destruction of the land, rivers and vegetation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="33"> Only firm evidence of the link between conservation and economic development can maintain people's commitment to Campfire, says Cherry Bird, wildlife co-ordinator for Hurungwe district.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="34"> 'Everybody has to feel they are benefiting tangibly from this programme so they'll be involved in management decisions.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="35"> It sounds idealistic, but the alternative is to have no wildlife'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="36"> The nomadic nature of wildlife is proving a problem.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="37"> The community where an animal is shot is the community that earns money - although several areas may have suffered crop damage en route.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="38"> There is, therefore, no guarantee of a stable income from year to year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="39"> Some villagers argue they are being bribed to put up with wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="40"> Others want their quotas increased so they can shoot more animals and earn more.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="41"> Nevertheless, districts are queueing up to be accepted into Campfire.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="42"> By the end of the year, 24 will have Campfire status and by 2000 more than half the country is expected to be devoted to wildlife conservation under the programme.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="43"> Elephants - which are not an endangered species in Zimbabwe - remain the biggest earners under Campfire because of their status symbol to safari hunters.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="44"> The hope is that other community businesses will become equally important to the local economies over time, says Ivan Bond, Campfire research fellow at the World Wide Fund for Nature.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="45"> 'In the long-term, Campfire principles will have to be applied holistically to the whole range of natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9176" num="46"> If the institutions exist for the management of one common property resource, it should not be too difficult to extend these to other resources.'</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="11"> "Africa" (two videos), Eco Ventures, 45 minutes each (1988).</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="12"> These two remarkable videos, produced by Megan Epler Wood and narrated by George Plimpton, will be of special interest to African safari planners and ecology-minded armchair travelers.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="13"> Each video combines spectacular scenery with a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="14"> The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for grasslands and water.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="15"> According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that has continued for 10 million years.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="16"> The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- hyenas, wild dogs and lions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="17"> You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="18"> The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly flowing Mara River are a video highlight that Plimpton calls "one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on earth".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="19"> Later, Wood captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of Amboseli National Park at the foot of Mt.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="20"> Kilimanjaro. Elephant teen-agers are shown trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors embracing each other as if greeting old friends.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="21"> Other animals shown in the park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="22"> The video concludes with a discussion between Plimpton and Russell Train, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation, on the threat from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="23"> The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and Martin Johnson safari of the 1920s, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life of a pride of lions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="24"> Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="25"> The pride survives in spite of the fact that, according to Plimpton, the female is a poor huntress, missing five out of six tries.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="26"> There also are brief scenes of some of the other cats in the Masai Mara Game Reserve, including leopards and cheetahs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="27"> Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "King Kong," comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda, where the late anthropologist Dian Fossey lived and died studying them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="28"> The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't survive in captivity.</s>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="29"> Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and the majestic silverback males protecting their territory.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="30"> Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble and frolic as they leave their mother to explore.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="31"> Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of the nened for conservation.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA011490-0067" num="47"> Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the Colorado River and canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of Colorado, and trips to the Monteverde Cloud Forest and the Carara Biological Reserve to view some of the many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being protected in Costa Rica.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="5"> It is possible that, within years, tigers could become extinct.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="6"> The conference to update the Cites convention on endangered species, which concluded this weekend in Florida, made that clear.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="7"> Would extinction matter?</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="8"> On one view, it might not: the loss would pose no immediate threat to human health or wealth.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="9"> But on several counts, it is worth putting effort into saving rare species.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="10"> In western eyes, tigers, elephants, whales and the like are romantic beasts, whose existence is valued even by those who never see a live specimen.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="11"> For local communities, the animals can add greatly to tourism revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="12"> For all countries, the animals represent a pool of genes which has potential value.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="13"> What is the best means of saving these species?</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="14"> The threats they face are poachers who want to sell tusks, hides and meat for profit, farmers who resent the damage they do, and the steady encroachment of human societies into wild habitats.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="15"> The essence of the task is to give people an economic incentive to keep the animals' numbers at sustainable levels.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="16"> But there are two particular problems.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="17"> One is that, as some east and central African countries have found, the benefits of the live animals, through tourism, generally go to the government and companies, while the value of dead animals is received by poachers and farmers.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="18"> Governments have found it hard to redistribute the benefits of tourism at a local level.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="19"> Second, demand for products such as rhino horn, driven largely by Asian markets, has not yet been checked by rising prices.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="20"> Given the disparity between Asian wealth and African poverty, it is possible that species would be extinct before prices rose by enough to choke demand.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="21"> One solution is simply to improve enforcement of national rules against killing animals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="22"> South Africa, which devotes considerable resources to protecting its wildlife, has found numbers of elephant and white rhino growing rapidly, even though it allows limited domestic trade in ivory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="23"> But that requires funds which are beyond the resources of poorer countries.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="24"> One of the best arguments for maintaining an international ban against trade in products of endangered species is that it makes guarding the animals easier and cheaper even for the poorest states.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="25"> The Worldwide Fund for Nature estimates that the budgets for protecting elephants have dropped by nearly 90 per cent in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania since the worldwide ban on ivory trade in 1989 A third device is to reduce demand for the products.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="26"> Environmental groups argue that since the start of the ivory ban, the price of ivory has fallen - where it can be obtained - while the price of rhino horn has increased.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="27"> That is, they say, partly because the main markets for ivory were in western countries which have enforced tough import controls on ivory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="28"> Meanwhile, western public opinion has turned against ivory, There is no single solution to the problem of supporting rare species.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="29"> But the Cites conference was right to uphold the ban on elephant and white rhino products, as one of several mechanisms.</s>

<s docid="FT944-8277" num="30"> The next useful step would be to increase pressure on those governments which have so far taken a relaxed attitude towards import of banned products.</s>

</HEADLINE>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="5"> By JULIAN OZANNE</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="6"> THE worldwide downturn in tourism last year, fuelled by the Gulf crisis, the international economic recession and the escalating costs of air travel, has proved a watershed in Kenya.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="7"> Kenya's dynamic tourism industry, although faced by the prospect of a severe loss of jobs and hard currency in what is its biggest foreign exchange earning sector, has turned 1991 from being a potential disaster into a mild success.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="8"> The private sector and the government, with cancellations running at up to 60 per cent for the peak season of January to March, rallied with a series of measures.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="9"> The boldest move by government was the decision to open up Kenya to South African tourists, several months before the October Commonwealth head of government conference in Harare.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="10"> Visas, previously denied to South Africans, were granted at the airport and an agreement was reached to allow South African Airways and Kenya Airways to operate one flight each a week between Nairobi and Johannesburg.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="11"> The government also gave new incentives to the hotel training college, established an autonomous airports authority and started the rehabilitation of Nairobi's international airport and continued to strengthen the newly-created Kenya Wildlife Service, a semi-autonomous parastatal in charge of security and management in Kenya's national parks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="12"> The private sector moved quickly, reducing rates and increasing charter flights, particularly from Spain and Britain.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="13"> In August and September there were 42 such flights a week arriving in Kenya, each with about 200 seats, in addition to scheduled flights.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="14"> These measures appear to have averted a slump in tourist arrivals which in 1990 nearly reached 900,000 people, while foreign exchange earnings last year should approach the 1990 level of Dollars 467m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="15"> Sustaining the remarkable growth which Kenya's tourist sector has enjoyed since independence will not be easy.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="16"> Since 1963 the numbers of visitors a year have increased from 110,000 to 889,000 in 1990 and foreign exchange earnings in the same period have mushroomed from Dollars 25m to Dollars 467m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="17"> In 1987, tourism overtook coffee as the country's number one foreign exchange earner.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="18"> The impact on the rest of the economy has been vast.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="19"> Throughout the last decade employment in the sector has grown by at least 5 per cent a year and tourism has contributed to the expansion of the services sector - hotels, restaurants, road and air transport - and to allied industries such as construction and food.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="20"> Much of the rapid growth in tourism in the past quarter of a century has been due to declining costs of air travel and the extensive infrastructure which was in place at independence.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="21"> The government has created a reasonably attractive enabling environment through welcoming foreign investment in tourism, the development of infrastructure and the maintenance of relative political stability.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="22"> Increasing importance has been given to conservation and better animal management and while the national parks and reserves sector was marred by a long period of poaching and inefficiency between 1976-88 it has become a top priority.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="23"> However, with mounting regional competition and the demands of the growing population a much greater effort is required.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="24"> In order to continue generating jobs and increasing critical foreign exchange earnings the government has recognised the need to creat a better environment.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="25"> Mr Philemon Mwaisaka, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Tourism, says the government is targeting two key areas for growth over the next three years: diversifying the type of tourism available and drawing in visitors from new markets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="26"> Diversification away from game parks and beaches will depend on giving greater importance to attractions such as cultural, conference and speciality tourism, scuba diving, fishing or mountaineering, and opening up new areas of Kenya to tourist development such as the volcanic desert around Lake Turkana.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="27"> Attracting visitors from outside the traditional markets of the US and Europe will require a big publicity drive in the Asia Pacific area, particularly Japan and Singapore.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="28"> In order to realise both ambitions a overhaul of Kenya's hitherto weak overseas marketing is necessary.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="29"> So far the government has been content to leave most of the marketing to the private sector.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="30"> Unlike many other countries Kenya does not have an autonomous tourist board.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="31"> Between 1986 and 1990 the government spent a mere Dollars 25m on marketing.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="32"> Kenya's well organised private sector has been lobbying hard for a tourist board to be set up under an autonomous director to launch a concerted marketing campaign of research, information gathering and publicity to enable the industry to better tailor and target their products in a competitive market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="33"> The government has given its blessing to the appeal but progress appears slow.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="34"> Good marketing and closer links with airlines will be vital to attract the high income from the choosy Japanese market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="35"> Plans for Kenya Airways to open up a route to Bangkok next year may prove insufficient to penetrate Asia and South Africa is proving a formidable competitor with Singapore Airlines operating a flight to Johannesburg.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="36"> A number of issues need the government's urgent attention.</s>

<s docid="FT921-15886" num="37"> Problem areas include privatisation of government share holdings in hotels, developing a strategy for high income VIP tourism, planning how to cope with the growing demand for combination tourism with tourists visiting at least two African countries, better harmonisation of visa and health requirements and more incentives, such as import duty exemption on vehicles for the tourist sector.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="9"> PROTECTING the tigers of Ranthambhore, India's best-known wildlife reserve, almost cost Devi Singh Rathore his life.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="10"> The 24-year-old forest guard was shot in the head, face and shoulder by a suspected poacher who fired at his Jeep with a shotgun.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="11"> The guard sitting next to him took the full force of the blast and died instantly.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="12"> A third man in the back of the vehicle was also killed and a fourth was injured.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="13"> 'What happened was terrible,' says Rathore, wincing from the pain of the two pellets which are still lodged in his body.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="14"> 'If this carries on it will be impossible to save the tigers'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="15"> The guards were attacked last April after being called out to track suspected poachers on the edge of the Ranthambhore reserve in the hot sandstone hills of southern Rajastan.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="16"> After three days travelling from village to village in search of information, they stumbled across three men camping in a makeshift tent.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="17"> They arrested two, but the third escaped.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="18"> On the way to back to their HQ, the guards stopped for a meal and a rest.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="19"> The delay proved fatal.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="20"> The escaped poacher had got ahead of the guards and, knowing the road they would have to take, had laid an ambush.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="21"> Choosing a steep-sided gorge, he rolled rocks into the road and hid behind the trees.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="22"> When the Jeep arrived, the poacher opened fire with a crude muzzle-loading shotgun.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="23"> Police later arrested a man and charged him with murder.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="24"> Poachers have long been active in India's reserves, hunting tigers, leopards and other cats for their fur and small animals for meat.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="25"> Most have been villagers living near parks with few other means of support.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="26"> In the 1970s and 1980s, India had great success in protecting tigers through a national campaign called Project Tiger, launched in 1973.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="27"> From one year to the next the numbers of Indian tigers went up.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="28"> From about 2,000 in 1973, India's tiger population rose to 4,300 by 1989, out of an estimated world total of 6,000-7,000.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="29"> Over the same period, India's human population rose by 60 per cent and the economy doubled in size.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="30"> India's experience seemed to prove that even in a poor and over-populated country, protection of the environment and economic development were not incompatible.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="31"> Ranthambhore, the beautiful former hunting preserve of the maharajahs of Jaipur, achieved particular fame because its tigers forsook traditional habits and became active during the day - supposedly because they now felt safe from man.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="32"> The park, with its ancient forts, Moghul pavilions and lakes, attracted plenty of tourists.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="33"> It was not until last year that conservationists realised that something was seriously wrong - when reports indicated alarming declines in the numbers of tigers at India's leading national parks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="34"> At Ranthambhore, the tiger tally dropped from 45 in 1991 to 17 last year, though the figure was revised this year to 28.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="35"> For wildlife experts the conclusion seemed inescapable: tigers were disappearing so fast that their survival was at stake.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="36"> Experts were quick to identify the origin of the new threat - an upsurge in demand for tiger bone for Chinese medicine.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="37"> Chinese apothecaries believe tiger bone has the power to restore energy and sexual prowess.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="38"> Factories in China, Taiwan and South Korea produce tens of thousands of bottles of tiger bone medicine for sale in east Asia and in Chinese communities around the world.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="39"> Conservationists say these factories have in the past used bone from Chinese tigers, including a vast stock which was accumulated when over 1,000 tigers were hunted and killed as pests in the 1950s in southern China.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="40"> In the last few years this stock seems to have run low, just at a time when fast economic growth has created millions of new customers for tiger bone medicine.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="41"> The trade is quite open.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="42"> Until recently apothecaries in Tihwa Street in Taipei displayed tiger bones in their windows, selling at a retail price of up to Dollars 1,500 per kilogramme.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="43"> The Huangshi Long March pharmaceutical factory in Hubei province, northern China, puts a tiger emblem on its packets of musk and tiger-bone plasters for use in treating rheumatism.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="44"> The first evidence of tigers being killed for their bones in India came in 1987 when poachers operating in the foothills of the Himalaya, in Uttar Pradesh, were found to have discarded a skin.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="45"> Proof came last year at Ranthambhore when a local poacher named Gopal Mogya and an accomplice, a meat trader, were caught on the edge of the park carrying a gun and a bag of bones.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="46"> The police say that Mogya confessed to selling bones and skins to a butcher in the nearby town of Sawai Madhopur.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="47"> In turn, the butcher said he supplied Mohamed Ashiq and Mohamed Ahmed, two brothers who own a tanning business in Fatehpur, a centre of the leather industry, some 200 miles from Sawai Madhopur.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="48"> Mohan Singh Bhati, the police superintendent at Sawai Madhopur, who estimates that 14-18 tigers have been poached from Ranthambhore, says it is the first time Indian police have broken such an extensive poaching ring.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="49"> From Fatehpur, the trail led to New Delhi where the police are investigating several fur and skin traders but have made no further arrests.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="50"> Wildlife experts working for Traffic, a unit of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which monitors trade in endangered species, say that Delhi is an important centre for dealing in skins, bones and other products.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="51"> The principal traders are often Kashmiris, who have moved their businesses to Delhi.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="52"> Kashmiris have a tradition of fur-making; they also have long-standing experience of trading with foreigners.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="53"> They established world-wide networks in the fur trade before international agreements in the 1970s suppressed the legitimate trade in wild animal products.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="54"> A few fur shops trade openly in New Delhi, for example in Yashwant Place, a run-down shopping centre favoured by hawkers dealing in smuggled wrist watches and Russian champagne.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="55"> But Traffic's experts believe that most of the skins are smuggled out of India, mainly to Kathmandu in Nepal, where there is also a sizeable Kashmiri community.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="56"> Nepal, like India, has tough laws against trading wild animal skins, but they are barely enforced.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="57"> Tourists can easily buy coats made of leopard and other skins in shops near big hotels.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="58"> Traffic researchers who visited the area last year counted 294 coats made from the skins of over 100 leopards, 14 clouded leopards and 2,500 other wild cats.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="59"> Traffic says tiger skins and bones are smuggled out of India by the same route but are rarely seen because of the international publicity that tigers attract.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="60"> The bones are mostly ground into powder and carried by couriers overland into Tibet or by air to Bangkok and Hong Kong.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="61"> Vivek Menon, of Traffic's Delhi office, says it is futile trying to estimate how much bone is taken out of India.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="62"> 'Very few people are arrested.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="63"> And they are always the minions'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="64"> The conservationists' top priority is to try to stop the bone-related poaching.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="65"> India, Nepal and China are all signatories of the 1973 Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, the main international agreement restricting trade in wildlife.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="66"> In line with the convention, all these countries have passed tough laws against trade in the products of endangered species.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="67"> But enforcement varies greatly.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="68"> Even in India, which has a comparatively good record, there is a loophole that allows traders in Kashmir to deal in skins taken from pre-1979 stocks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="69"> Under pressure from conservationists, governments are starting to act.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="70"> China has announced plans for an east Asian wildlife protocol, an agreement to restrict trade in wildlife, to be signed later this year by ministers from east Asian countries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="71"> But it is difficult to see what benefits the protocol will bring, other than to remind governments of their existing commitments.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="72"> Kamal Nath, the Indian minister for the environment and forests, says protecting the tiger is an issue for all countries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="73"> 'We need help,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="74"> The help he has in mind is pressure on east Asian countries brought by the US and other export markets.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="75"> Conservationists also believe that important changes are needed in the running of the 19 reserves which now come under Project Tiger.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="76"> These reserves are the pick of India's wildlife parks, sanctuaries not only for tigers but for numerous other species, including leopards, elephants and the country's last surviving rhinoceroses.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="77"> The decline in the numbers of tigers has drawn attention to serious shortcomings in the management of these parks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="78"> Valmik Thapar, author of studies on the tigers of Ranthambhore, says the only way forward is to involve local people more in the running of the park.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="79"> Former poachers would make good gamekeepers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="80"> Villagers could be encouraged to work as forest guards.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="81"> Informants could be paid for tips about poachers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7330" num="82"> Without such efforts, the tiger may be doomed.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0109" num="11"> The Department of Fish and Game, with funding and assistance from the Cherry Valley Archers of San Bernardino and the Arrowhead Fish and Game Club, has transplanted 89 of the Merriam's species from the Black Hills of South Dakota to four sites near Big Bear Lake and to the Tejon Ranch in the Tehachapis.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0109" num="12"> Another 180 went to sites in central and Northern California, where virtually all of the state's 100,000 Rio Grande turkeys reside.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0109" num="13"> According to Chuck Wagner of the Cherry Valley Archers, these are the first wild turkeys planted in Southern California since 1938, when some pen-raised birds were tried but couldn't cope with predators.</s>

<s docid="LA030189-0109" num="15"> Whereas the Rio Grandes in central and Northern California -- themselves imports from Texas at one time -- prefer low-elevation oak and brush habitat, the Merriam's birds favor higher elevations and conifer forests.</s>

<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="12"> Ghana</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="13"> Accra GHANAIAN TIMES in English reports in its 3 February edition that "The Ministry of Environment and the Greater Accra regional administration" on 2 February "ordered the stone breakers of Achimota Forest area near Accra to cease their operations within 24 hours or face prosecution".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="14"> This order follows a previous one issued in May asking the stone breakers to move from the area by October and to go to another site at Pokuase but the order was not complied with.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="15"> Environment Minister Christine Amoako-Nuamah, who gave the order, said the Achimota Forest stone breakers' activities were "causing a serious environmental problem to the people living around the Achimota and Legon areas".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="16"> Accra DAILY GRAPHIC in English reports in its 9 February edition that, according to studies conducted by the University of Science and Technology, the River Subin, which flows through Kumasi and its environs, is "almost dead".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="17"> "High levels of environmental pollution and irresponsible management practices by the Kumasi Metropolitan Authority and communities along the river" threaten the Subin as well as the Kentikrono, Wewe, Susan, and Aboabo Rivers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="18"> Mrs. Esi Awuah, environmental biologist at the university, says the oxygen levels in these rivers are depleting to such an extent that they are "gradually losing their ability to contain higher forms of life".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="19"> Mrs. Awuah stated most industries near Atonsu, where the rivers join together in a valley, "do not have waste treatment plants and poison control units" and therefore discharge "untreated chemicals of a toxic nature" into the confluence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="20"> The communities along the river have long practiced the "dumping of night soil" and some have even constructed "places of convenience" directly over the water.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="21"> Her research has shown that the Subin could restore itself in 32 days "if proper environmental and sanitary measures are adopted".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="22"> Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English at 1300 GMT on 3 March reports that the program officer of the Environmental Protection Council, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="23"> K. O.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="24"> Omare, has cautioned that if proper controls and incentive mechanisms are not put in place for industrial development in Ghana, "environmental pollution would assume alarming proportions in the near future".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="25"> He said efforts so far made toward control or prevention of the adverse effects of industry have been "largely inadequate".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="26"> Mr. Omare gave the warning at a symposium organized to mark Environmental Day at the Buy Ghana-Export Ghana '94 Fair in Accra.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="27"> Our reporter, who was present at the symposium, adds that there is a "growing concern in the country about industrial waste and pollution, health and safety hazards to workers, and public health problems due to adverse environmental changes and the misapplication of hazardous chemicals".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="28"> A UN Industrial Development Organization study carried out in 1984 on industrial pollution reported that for the zone between Cote d'Ivoire and Benin, including Ghana, industrial pollutants are produced mainly by the textile industry, whose waste contains 30 percent of four polluting substances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="29"> Manufacturers of food products contribute 25 percent, while petroleum refining and handling produce 20 percent of industrial waste.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="30"> Mineral exploitation and processing are also responsible for about 10 percent of the waste.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="31"> Guinea</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="32"> Conakry Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique de Guinea in French at 0645 GMT on 17 March reports that at its recent session the Council of Ministers decided to stop deforestation and stressed "the need to preserve forest resources as well as state land reserves".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="33"> It adds that at a time when environmental protection organizations are warning against global warming and stressing the need to preserve trees and forests, Guineans irresponsibly set the country's forests and vegetation on fire.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="34"> By doing so they leave "the countryside to the mercy of sand, wind, and erosion, in short, desert encroachment".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="35"> The government has launched a campaign to save these forests and protect the nation's interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="36"> Therefore, as far as the Koukou forest in Kindia is concerned the 1949 demarcation will be respected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="37"> People living in the area will be evacuated before 30 March and all land allocations and occupation made within the limits of nonprotected zones and state lands reserves have been declared null and void in all prefectures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="38"> As President Lansana Conte recently said: We must preserve our riches.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="39"> The forest is the source of our great wealth.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="40"> Nigeria</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="41"> Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 1 March reports that the Edo State administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Muhammed Onuka, has undertaken an inspection tour of the erosion- ravaged areas of Benin-City.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="42"> At the Iwaseta-Orin road square, the administrator said that if the flood in the area was controlled, the road could serve as a by-pass to the state capital.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="43"> Col. Onuka directed the state environment task force to produce a comprehensive report on the erosion-devastated areas of the state for necessary action.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="44"> Tanzania</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="45"> Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania External Service in English at 1600 GMT on 15 March reports the government plans "to carry out a study to determine the number of hotels that can be built in the national parks without threatening wild game and the environment".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="46"> The prime minister and first vice president, John Malecela, told the president of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="47"> J. Hare, that the study would cover all the national parks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="48"> The prime minister said Tanzania "would welcome foreign assistance in carrying out the study" and the IUCN showed interest in assisting in the study.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="49"> Honorable Malecela said poaching was a very serious problem in the national parks as poachers were using increasingly sophisticated weapons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="50"> He said the poachers, mostly from war-torn Somalia, were using machine guns and were very ruthless in their methods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="51"> He said Tanzania was forced to use its limited resources to deal with this problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="52"> The prime minister said drought in northern Tanzania had seriously affected wild animals and thousands had died.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22368" num="53"> Mr. Hare said the IUCN would open an office in Dar es Salaam.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="7"> TOURISM in Kenya dropped sharply last year, reducing hard currency revenues from the industry to Dollars 295m from Dollars 400m (Pounds 195m from Pounds 266m) in 1991, a government official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nairobi.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="8"> Mr Philemon Mwaisaka, permanent secretary at the ministry of tourism, blamed the sharp downturn in visits to safari parks or Indian Ocean beaches on reports in western countries, where most visitors come from, about attacks on tourists, tribal violence and political unrest.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="9"> 'Imagined insecurity in Kenya had convinced European-based tourists that the country was not safe,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="10"> The run-up to December's first multi-party polls in 26 years was marred by tribal violence.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="11"> This, coupled with bandit attacks on tourists, led to a fall in hotel bookings of up to 60,000 bed-nights in the last five months of 1992, tourism officials say.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="12"> Last year, some 700,000 tourists visited Kenya after a record 814,000 in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="13"> But many, enticed by cheap bucket-shop deals, kept their wallets closed while in the country.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="14"> Mr Mwaisaka said the government was fighting back with a vigorous campaign to revitalise the industry and woo visitors.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="15"> He said security in national parks would be stepped up, more roads would be built and accommodation would be improved.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="16"> 'Protection of endangered species like elephants and rhinos has received priority,' he added.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="17"> 'Poaching has been reduced to almost zero and an elaborate security network put in place to ensure tourists' safety and increased comfort,' he added.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="18"> The government has also begun aerial surveillance of game parks and issued advice about which areas of Nairobi are considered dangerous.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="19"> Fears for the safety of tourists have been fuelled by attacks in game parks, particularly the Masai Mara reserve.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="20"> Germany and the US have warned their nationals not to go to parks while Britain and Australia have cautioned against travel in parks when unaccompanied by rangers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="21"> Kenya, which rejected International Monetary Fund and World Bank-backed reforms last month, badly needs tourists to help purchase essential imports and service a Dollars 7.1bn foreign debt.</s>

<s docid="FT932-16493" num="22"> President Daniel arap Moi, angered over an IMF refusal to reinstate critical balance of payments support of around Dollars 40m a month, two weeks ago called a halt to liberalisation policies and said Kenya would go its own way.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="6"> THE DELICATELY laundered white mosquito net around my bed made the room look like a bridal suite.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="7"> I ordered a beer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="8"> As I quenched a thirst brought on by a morning game drive in the bush, I glanced through the window and counted eight zebra, five water-buck and nine elephants heading towards a water-hole.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="9"> It was early February in Kenya's Tsavo national park and the temperature had not dropped below 93'c Fahrenheit all day.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="10"> Tsavo, halfway between Mombasa and Nairobi, is the largest game sanctuary in East Africa.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="11"> Thirty-six hours earlier we had struggled through fog to Gatwick; now we were outbidding each other with sightings of exotic animals.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="12"> This was my first two-centre holiday - a week divided between the comforts of an Indian Ocean beach hotel outside Mombasa and game rides into the bush of Tsavo and the Taita Hills private game sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="13"> Seven of us climbed on to a safari mini-bus for a game drive to Salt Lick Lodge, a sanctuary in the Taita Hills that was once a sisal plantation.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="14"> The success of any game drive depends largely on the skills, prescience and character of the driver-guide.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="15"> With Hamid, we were lucky.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="16"> Off the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, Hamid turned the zebra- striped Nissan down red dirt tracks surrounded by thorn scrub and short grass.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="17"> He could interpret the significance of a lump of animal dung or a patch of smoothed-down grass with tremendous skill.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="18"> Following trails and tracks, we saw giraffes, gazelles, zebra, dikdik and exotic birds that would have driven twitchers into a frenzy.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="19"> The game park lodges for overnight accommodation are a misnomer, having less to do with Karen Blixen than with Conrad Hilton.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="20"> Indeed, Salt Lick Safari Lodge in Taita Hills is owned by Hilton.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="21"> Built around a natural salt lick, the clusters of rooms are on pillars to let the animals wander freely underneath the lodge.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="22"> At dawn we set off north for Tsavo, once notorious for man-eating lions and more recently for the Somali poachers who have plundered the black rhino population.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="23"> Just when you think the views are unsurpassable, you reach Voi Lodge in Tsavo East.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="24"> Built on an escarpment, the lodge overlooks a remarkable series of linked water holes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="25"> From my room I watched the gigantic amphitheatre fill with dozens of elephants, their hides rusted from rolling in the red earth around the water holes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="26"> Waking at first light the following day, I disentangled myself from the mosquito net and watched the continuing parade of wildlife, headed this time by water buffalo and ostriches.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="27"> The morning was still cool; the scent of wild flowers filled the lodge.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="28"> The last lap of the safari took us to Tsavo West national park, with a detour past Mzima Springs from where millions of gallons of crystal water are piped daily to Mombasa.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="29"> This oasis, surrounded by a valley of arid lava, is a haven for hippos.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="30"> On the rough track to Ngulia Lodge, an inspired diversion by Hamid took us to a pride of lions in a broad patch of long grass.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="31"> Two new-born cubs romped with elder members of the family; then, seeking a feed, they were gently cuffed away by a lioness.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="32"> Ngulia Lodge, in Tsavo West, is a mecca for migrating birds.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="33"> The lights of the isolated lodge attract hundreds of species, and there is a roll-call of rare visitors.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="34"> Madagascar bee-eaters, penduline tits, hammerkops, wheatears, warblers and waders are all regulars, together with a species bearing the memorable name of 'red-cheeked cordon bleu'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="35"> Four days of safari are rewarded with a long weekend of relaxation at Safari Beach hotel outside Mombasa.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="36"> How safe is a safari holiday?</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="37"> The sudden spate of attacks on tourists in the Masai Mara, east of Tsavo, earlier this year was unprecedented for Kenya and led to increased security.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="38"> Operators are insisting on a minimum of two vehicles travelling together on particular game drives in the Mara's remoter areas.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="39"> But travellers to Tsavo -unlike the Mara, Tsavo is controlled by the Kenya Wildlife Service - have faced no difficulties.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="40"> Kenya is still safer than Key West.</s>

<s docid="FT923-1974" num="41"> Richard Gilbert travelled with Portland Holidays, whose 'Portrait of Kenya' combined safari and beach holidays start at Pounds 689 per person for a week (from November 1).</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="6"> The World Bank is this month due to grant Romania Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m) to help preserve the Danube delta, Europe's largest remaining wetland and one of its most important wildlife sanctuaries, which is under increasing threat from industrial pollution.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="7"> After years of mismanagement under Romania's former communist regime, the delta's unique ecosystems are being destroyed by the pollutants and waste accumulated by the River Danube on its 2,700km journey through the industrial heartland of Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="8"> The delta covers 580,000ha in eastern Romania and southern Ukraine where the Danube splits into three main branches and enters the Black Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="9"> For centuries, it has provided a sanctuary for rare birds, fish and wildlife, as well as for persecuted human beings.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="10"> It is home to more than 75 species of fish, rare mammals such as the European mink and wild cat, and an estimated 300 species of birds including Dalmatian pelicans, pygmy cormorants, red-breasted geese, glossy ibis and several kinds of egret and heron.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="11"> Its few thousand human inhabitants are mainly descendants of ethnic Ukrainians and Russians driven out of tsarist Russia in the 17th and 18th centuries because of their religious beliefs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="12"> In 1991, Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) added the delta to its World Heritage list.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="13"> But the region is more than just an area of beauty and environmental interest.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="14"> 'The delta is a natural buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea,' says Irina Luca, project officer for the World Bank in Bucharest.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="15"> 'Its vegetation filters out pollutants and purifies water from the river before it enters the sea.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="16"> This is very important given the high levels of pollution already found in the Black Sea'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="17"> One of the first acts of Romania's post-communist government in 1990 was to halt all building and land reclamation projects in the delta, to designate the region a protected biosphere area and to set up the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority to administer it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="18"> The World Bank grant, made from its Global Environment Facility, will be used to reverse some of the damage done in the past 50 years and to strengthen the authority, which is based in the port of Tulcea where the delta begins.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="19"> One aim of the five-year project is to restore reed banks and land reclaimed by the communists for agricultural use to their natural state.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="20"> Reeds, which cover about one-third of the delta, are particularly important - it is in compact reed banks that water from the Danube is trapped and filtered, says Grigore Baboianu, the authority's executive director.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="21"> The country's former rulers saw the reeds as a cheap source of cellulose for paper manufacturing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="22"> In the 1950s, plans were drawn up to harvest half a million tonnes a year from the delta.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="23"> Although this target was never reached, Baboianu says large areas of reeds were destroyed or damaged by heavy harvesting equipment.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="24"> Another important aim of the project is to prevent further damage to the delta.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="25"> Around one-third of the World Bank grant will be used to strengthen the authority's supervisory and administrative functions.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="26"> A law passed last December gave it wide-ranging powers, including responsibility for licensing fishing and other commercial activities and the right to fine those who fail to respect environmental protection rules.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="27"> Shipping and other companies, for example, can be fined for discharging dirty water into the delta and individuals for fishing without a permit.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="28"> In practice, however, the authority has had insufficient funds to carry out its tasks adequately.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="29"> 'At the moment, we have just 90 wardens - one for every 4,000-5,000ha - and no way of contacting them in the field,' says Baboianu.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="30"> The grant will be used to increase the number of wardens to 250, to train them and to buy equipment such as boats, binoculars and radios.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="31"> Wardens monitor the environment and wildlife in their districts and check that regulations are adhered to.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="32"> The emphasis is on working with local communities, which are among the poorest and most isolated in Romania and whose people live from the land and from fishing and hunting.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="33"> Most can only be reached by boat.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="34"> Baboianu says: 'We do have problems with poachers and with people misunderstanding our role, but we do not want to be seen as a force against the people.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="35"> We hope we can convince them to look on us as some kind of ecological vet, helping preserve and improve the area for everyone'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="36"> A greater problem is protecting the delta from pollutants in the Danube, especially fertilisers, phosphates and nutrients used in intensive farming.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="37"> Their excessive use has led to eutrophication, manifested by an explosion of algae.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="38"> 'This phenomenon is very dangerous for us.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="39"> Algae cover the surface of the water and block light and oxygen for the more complex water plants and animals below, eventually killing them,' says Baboianu.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="40"> This problem cannot be solved without co-operation from other Danube and Black Sea countries, many of which, like Romania, are undergoing difficult transitions to a market economy and can ill afford environmental clean-up projects.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="41"> 'We've made a start,' says Baboianu, 'but we can't look at the delta in isolation.</s>

<s docid="FT943-8480" num="42"> We also need to solve the problems upstream and downstream.'</s>
