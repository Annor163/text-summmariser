<s docid="FBIS4-2026" num="16"> According to Li Shouren, chief engineer of the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Three Gorges Project will need a total of 26 large generating sets, each with a 700,000 kw capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2026" num="17"> The design and manufacturing process for the hydraulic turbine -- one of the largest hydropower units in the world, each with a wheel about 9.85 meters in length -- require fairly high technical standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-2026" num="18"> In recent years, China's machine-building industry has made many attempts to solve major technical problems and other preparations for the manufacturing of such power units.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="6"> China's energy planners are confident they will be able to add nearly 100,000MW of power generating capacity to the grid system by the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="7"> They are counting on accelerated inputs from foreign private sector investors to help achieve this ambitious target.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="8"> According to energy officials, a total of 12,000-15,000MW of new capacity are being planned for each year for at least the next decade, the major proportion destined for the rapidly industrialising regions in southern and eastern China.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="9"> Large power stations are also planned at coalfields in the interior.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="10"> These will require a major extension of transmission lines to shift electricity to the industrial centres.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="11"> But this adjustment in the location of some new installations will also ease the burden on China's overtaxed rail coal haulage system and gradually minimise coal supply problems at far-distant power stations.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="12"> The growth, if attained, will bring China's installed capacity to 265,000MW, against the current level of approximately 165,000MW.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="13"> According to Han Ying, China's vice-minister for coal, the mix will continue to be dominated by coal - some 70 per cent of China's power capacity is coal-fired.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="14"> Annual coal production is expected to rise to 1.4bn tonnes per year by 2000 compared with 1.1bn tonnes last year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="15"> The closing of inefficient pits and the commercialisation of the coal-mining industry could lead to some new thermal projects using other fuel sources.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="16"> Most of the balance is derived from hydroelectric power - China has Asia's biggest rivers - and preliminary work is already under way on the world's largest hydroelectric project, the 17,000MW Three Gorges scheme on the Upper Yangtse.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="17"> The China Yangtse Three Gorges Project Development Corp. is now organising the bidding, which will be open to domestic and foreign contractors.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="18"> First power from the complex could be on line early in the next decade.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="19"> A third factor in the generating mix is nuclear.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="20"> Later this year, the first half of the 1,900MW Daya Bay nuclear power project in Guangdong Province near Hong Kong will go on line, to be followed a year later by phase two.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="21"> The complex is being built by a consortium of the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom, and the French companies, Framatome, Electricite de France and Campenon Bernard.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="22"> The Daya Bay complex is expected to be succeeded by another of similar size in southeast China, to be built by foreign companies, which have not yet been designated.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="23"> China's first power generating reactor, a 300MW unit, went on line at Qinshan, near Shanghai, last year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="24"> The Qinshan plant is largely home-grown.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="25"> A second is planned as part of a programme to add five new reactors with 3,300MW of capacity to the system by the early 2000s.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="26"> All will be built in the northeast or the southeast.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="27"> The long lead times for nuclear and hydroelectric mean that there are growing opportunities for non-coal thermal projects, not a significant factor at present.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="28"> For example, the ABB Group recently announced a 300MW combined cycle contract on behalf of Hong Kong interests for a plant to be set up in southern China.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="29"> 'The average installation time for combined cycle is 18-24 months, whereas coal stations, which normally are much larger, take 36-48 months to install,' an ABB official said.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="30"> Given China's 1.1bn population and a birth rate of 17m births a year, analysts say the major challenge will be on funding infrastructure projects.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="31"> The central and regional power authorities have partially dealt with this by throwing open their doors to foreign investment, not just minority holdings in joint ventures but full ownership.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="32"> They appear to have accepted in principle the need to establish a commercial approach to tariff rates, without which private sector involvement in the growth programme will dry up.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="33"> Mr RT Fox, vice-chairman, Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, said in Beijing recently that he was encouraged by China's flexibility.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="34"> 'Ownership of a power project can vary from 100 per cent Chinese to 100 per cent foreign; the life the venture can be 10 years, 20 years or with no transfer date foreseen.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="35">. '.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="36"> The private sector phenomenon stems from the success of Hong Kong's Hopewell Group, which formed two build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects in southern China, the long-completed 700MW Shajiao B scheme and the new 1,980MW Shajiao C scheme, now under construction.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="37"> Under these, Hopewell and partners build the plant and sell electricity at commercial rates to the local grid, turning the project back to Chinese ownership after a decade or so of ownership.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="38"> Since then, BOT and other schemes with indefinite ownership for foreign companies have flourished.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="39"> In fast-growing Guangdong province, virtually all the 68,000MW of power stations to be installed over the longer term could, it is suggested, have some private sector involvement.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="40"> The International Finance Corp., the private sector wing of the World Bank, has opened an office in Beijing.</s>

<s docid="FT932-7110" num="41"> Sir William Ryrie, IFC vice-president, said the institution would provide Dollars 600m to help finance projects with a total cost of Dollars 3bn over the next three years.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="18"> On the basis of the hydropower development trend around the world, the Three Gorges Power Plant should be expanded to the largest installed capacity allowable after taking the compensation effect of the hydropower stations in the upper reaches 30 years later.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="19"> It should generate more power for peak shaving and reduce its hours of operation to approximately 4,000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="20"> Individual generator capacity should exceed 800,000 kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="21"> A total of 24 units should be installed with a total capacity of 19.20 MkW; 1.52 MkW higher than that in the validation plan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="22"> On 3 April 1992, the Fifth Meeting of the Seventh Plenum of the People's Congress passed a historic resolution that included the Three Gorges Project in the 10-Year Plan for economic and social development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="23"> The State Council was authorized to select the proper time for its implementation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="24"> It approved a validated plan with a normal water level of 175 meters that involves one-time construction, staged water storage, and continuous relocation of people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="25"> Nevertheless, the installed capacity of the station requires further investigation and discussion.</s>
<H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="26"> (1) Discussion on Installed Capacity of the Three Gorges Hydropower Project</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="27"> The "Resolution Regarding the Construction of the Three Gorges Project" specified that a total of 26 generators with an individual capacity of 680,000 kW will be installed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="28"> The total installed capacity is 17.68 MkW and 84 billion kWh of electricity will be generated annually.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="29"> Total installed capacity is determined by the individual unit capacity and number of units chosen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="30"> The selection of total installed capacity, however, has a direct impact on the water energy utilization efficiency, economic benefit and overall layout of the pivot.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="31"> The annual and monthly flow and the head height of the water at the pivot, reservoir capacity and its regulating behavior determines the overall energy specification.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="32"> Installed capacity is determined on the basis of the need of the power grid and economic feasibility by using a water utilization rate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="33"> Installed capacity is also a direct function of operating hours per year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="34"> It should match the total flow passing through all generators up and down the river.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="35"> Based on the superior central geographic location of the Three Gorges Plant and its role in the future national power system, as well as on the peak shaving need of the power grid 10-15 years down the road, the Three Gorges hydropower station is designed to operate 4,571 hours per year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="36"> This is slightly on the high side in reference to the number of yearly operating hours of stations already completed or under construction with capacity greater than 1 MkW as shown in Table 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="39"> About half of them are at approximately 3,500 hours.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="40"> The Gezhouba station is apparently operating at a high rate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="41"> For a power station that does not have much regulating capacity, if the number of hours in operation is reduced to 4,000 per year, then an additional 1.20 MkW of capacity can be installed and the amount of water discharge can be substantially decreased.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="42"> For this reason, all hydropower plants around the world are expanding their capacity based on the peak shaving requirements of the grid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="43"> This can not only enhance the peak shaving effect, but can also make full use of available water resources to meet seasonal demands without discharging or minimizing discharging flood water.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="44"> In China, in order to improve its peak shaving capability, the northeast power grid is planning to expand the Fengman station to 1 MkW (approximately doubling it in size).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="45"> Along this line of thinking, we are spending billions to construct pumped-storage power stations (such as Shisan Ling, Guangxu and Tianhuanging) just to solve the peak shaving problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="46"> Premier Li Peng [2621 7720] clearly pointed out in the Three Gorges Project Construction Workshop on 19 November that the Three Gorges Project must be constructed using means compatible with our socialist market economy and managed with modern techniques.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="47"> To expand the installed capacity of the Three Gorges Project is to offer its tremendous peak shaving capacity to the national power grid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="48"> This is in accordance with our socialist market economy that will produce great economic benefits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="49"> If the tiered price structure is expanded nationwide, it will provide the force needed to enlarge installed capacity in hydropower stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="50"> It also provides a very promising solution to resolving our peak demand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="51"> We should totally discard the idea that a better hydropower plant is one with long operating hours and high equipment utilization efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="52"> According to an analysis on balanced electric power and energy done by the Chang Jiang Committee during the planning stage of the project, using the year 2015 as the design target, the installed capacity of the Three Gorges is 20.40 million kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="53"> The corresponding water utilization coefficient is 94 percent and the hours of operation is 4,268.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="54"> In reference to the overall layout of the Three Gorges pivot, it is better to operate the power plant at approximately 4,000 hours per year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="55"> The corresponding installed capacity is 20-21 million kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="56"> If it is lowered to 3,500-3,000 hours, then the corresponding installed capacity is 24-28 million kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="57"> Without changing the layout, there are two major approaches to increase installed capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="58"> One is to increase the individual capacity and the other is to increase the number of units.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="59"> We should consider the double-row layout used in Nanchang that adopted the original Russian Tokto-gul hydropower station design and the Lijiaxia hydropower station under construction on the Huang He.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="60"> This compact layout is a better approach to increase the number of installed units.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="65"> (2) Discussion on the Selection of Individual Unit Capacity for the Three Gorges Hydropower Station</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="66"> The current plan selects a 680,000 kW generator.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="67"> The major advantage is that it can be manufactured domestically.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="68"> The disadvantage is that its capacity is too low and the total installed capacity is also too low.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="69"> The author believes that a generator should be selected based on a layout that suits the optimal installed capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="70"> We should also choose a plan that employs the most technologically advanced, economically feasible unit that would maximize the total installed capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="71"> We are building the largest hydropower plant in the world and we are planning to install units at the level of the 1970s.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="72"> Moreover, it is even lower than the individual capacity at the Grand Coulee and Itaipu.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="73"> This is way out of the ordinary.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="74"> We are stressing the fact that we want to be self-sufficient.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="75"> We need to liberate our thinking and change our concept.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="76"> The selection of individual unit capacity needs to be revalidated based on a socialist market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="77"> Generators that are going to be installed over a dozen years down the road ought to be a product of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="84"> The first one is Plan 2 where the turbine diameter is a non-standard value of 9.85 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="85"> The output of the turbine is 729 MW and the generator unit produces 700 MW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="86"> This plan ensures that the individual unit capacity at the Three Gorges is equal to that at two existing famous power plants, i.e., the Itaipu at the Brazil-Paraguay border and the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="87"> The number of units remains unchanged and the layout does not need to be altered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="88"> The total installed capacity is 700MW x 26 = 18,200MW, which is 520,000 kW higher than that in the validated plan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="89"> Second is Plan 5.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="90"> The turbine diameter is D1 = 10.40 m, the turbine output is 824,700 kW and the generator unit output is 800,000 kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="91"> Because the plan requires the use of a 13.5 m diameter pressure steel pipe, the center distance between units is increased by 3 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="92"> In order to keep the flood gates and ship locks in their original positions, the north and south plants need to reduce the number of units by one each, i.e., 13 units in the north and 11 in the south.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="93"> The total number is 24 and the overall installed capacity is 800MW x 24 = 19,200MW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="94"> It is 1.52MW larger than that in the validated plan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="95"> A station of the same length can accommodate 22 0.9MW units with a total installed capacity of 19.8 million kW, or 20 1MW units with a total installed capacity of 20 million kW.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="96"> It is obvious that installing 0.8MW units is the most effective way to raise the overall installed capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="97"> By the end of this century, China should have the capability to manufacture 800MW generator units.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="98"> It is also possible to jointly design and manufacture with foreign firms as in the case of the Geheyan hydropower station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="99"> It also may be possible to solicit international bids for some of the units.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="100"> (3) Conclusion</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="101"> The Three Gorges hydropower station must take the compensating and regulating effect of the hydropower stations upstream 30 years from now into account.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="102"> It must take full advantage of its location at the center of national power grid and generate as much power for peak shaving as possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="103"> It should have the maximum installed capacity possible to enhance its peak shaving capability.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="104"> It is recommended that 24 generator units with an individual unit capacity of 800MW be placed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="105"> Since there is essentially no change in plant length and location, there will be minimal change to the water flow downstream.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="106"> The diameter of the steel pipe is increased by 10 percent to 13.5 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="107"> The increase in difficulty to manufacture should be easy to handle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="108"> Our hydropower experts, scholars and colleagues should revalidate the individual unit capacity and unit number based on the new socialist market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="109"> There is still time to change the design.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="110"> Despite the fact that two 170,000 kW units were successfully tested at the Erjiang station of Gezhouba, the Dajiang station refused to use it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="111"> Instead, it is still using the smaller 125,000 kW unit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="112"> The consequences are that it is wasting water 100 days a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="113"> Hopefully, this will not happen at the Three Gorges.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20606" num="114"> The plan to install 24 800MW units at the Three Gorges is of vital importance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="16"> [Text] China is hoping that co-operation with foreign engineering companies will help provide more large-capacity generators to meet the country's rising demand for power.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="17"> Foreign companies are welcome to invest in the production of thermal, hydroelectric and nuclear power-generating equipment, according to official sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="18"> Attracted by the country's huge market for power stations, foreign big names in the industry are eagerly searching China for co-operative partners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="19"> Giants like ABB, Siemens, General Electric and Westinghouse Electric are negotiating with Chinese manufacturers to set up joint ventures in the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="20"> A joint venture between Siemens AG of Germany and Dongfang Electric Co., a major electrical machinery producer based in Southeast China's Sichuan Province, is awaiting approval from authorities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="21"> The main problem in Sino-foreign co-operation is the question of who will hold the majority of shares in the joint ventures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="22"> Chinese and foreign sides both demand controlling stakes in their joint ventures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="23"> The issue is crucial, since setting up joint ventures in China is one strategy for foreign companies to use in winning contracts for the Three Gorges project, the world's largest hydroelectric project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="24"> The huge project revolves around 26 hydroelectric generating units, each with a capacity of 700,000 kilowatts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="25"> China hopes that these generators will be produced co-operatively by Chinese and foreign companies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="26"> According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Machinery Industry, China's power generator production reached 12.78 million kilowatts last year, an increase of 7.7 percent over the previous year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="27"> But production still lags behind domestic demand, said Xu Lianyi, director of the ministry's Department of Major Industrial Equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="28"> The government plans to raise total installed capacity from last year's 180 million kilowatts to 280 million to 300 million kilowatts by the end of the century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="29"> This means that in the next seven years China must install generators with the capacity of 100 million to 120 million kilowatts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="30"> To do this, the ministry has to approve the production of more than 14 million kilowatts annually, Xu said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="31"> He said that the biggest obstacle for domestic manufacturers is the shortage of money, which will hamper planned production this year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="32"> Chinese-made generators cost only half the price of imported units, but since domestic manufacturers earn little in profits they cannot raise enough capital for future development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20660" num="33"> Still, in recent years China has exported generators worth $230 million to developing countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="6"> China is currently astride the world's most ambitious power development programme, having set itself a target of 300,000MW of installed capacity by the turn of the century.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="7"> The programme, according to China's Ministry of Electric Power, calls for a further 12,000MW of capacity to be added this year, boosting levels from the end-1993 figure of 176,000MW.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="8"> The pace of new power additions will be accelerated on a year-by year basis and will reach a remarkable rate of 20,000MW per year in new power plant additions by 1996 at least.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="9"> The programme is breathtaking by global standards and exceeds by a wide margin expansion programmes being planned by other developing nations.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="10"> Even if the target is not achieved, the gains still will be substantial enough to provide exceptional business opportunities for western equipment suppliers, consultants, banks and companies seeking partnerships in the power sector.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="11"> Not surprisingly, the front runners in Chinese joint ventures are such Hong Kong-based groups as the private sector utility China Light & Power (CLP); Gordon Wu's CEPA, a division of Hopewell Holdings; New World Development, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="12"> An increasing number of outside groups is joining the long queue.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="13"> Among these are the US Wing Group, as well as equipment manufacturers General Electric and Westinghouse Electric; PowerGen and BICC of the UK and numerous other companies from Europe, Japan and North America.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="14"> According to the Ministry, a total of 35,000MW of capacity will be up for grabs by foreign independent power developers between now and 2000.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="15"> Without such foreign help, its ambitious targets will fall far short of target.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="16"> It has identified a total of 34 projects, both large and small, which it wants to see developed on a build-own-operate or build-operate-transfer (BOO-BOT) basis.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="17"> Most of its proposed foreign partner programmes are coal-fired, and some small hydroelectric schemes are also being considered for the private sector.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="18"> However, the government wants to diversify its energy sources for foreign joint ventures, particularly along coastal sites where coal is not easily available owing to rail transport problems, away from coal and hydro and into other fuels, notably piped gas, LNG and nuclear.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="19"> This will be a big challenge in that the two power sources comprise virtually all China's electricity supply.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="20"> A natural gas pipeline will supply the first 2,400MW phases of Hong Kong's Black Point power station starting in 1996.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="21"> The complex is owned by CLP of Hong Kong.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="22"> Preliminary discussions suggest that some of the gas, taken from Hainan Island, could be used for other power stations, but that will depend on the Hainan reserves.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="23"> At present, the gas is the only such supply being used for power generation in China.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="24"> Several foreign ventures are bidding to establish LNG terminals along the China coast, notably the Wing Group, which is examining terminal sites in the Shanghai region.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="25"> The LNG would have to be imported but would alleviate coal pollution and transport problems.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="26"> The World Bank recently announced a Dollars 255m development loan to boost natural gas potential in Sichuan Province to underpin a Dollars 945m scheme.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="27"> The aim of the scheme is to cut down reliance on coal, particularly for home heating, and to create a base of gas for power station use isn the region.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="28"> A major development is China's nuclear programme.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="29"> The first 950MW unit of the Anglo-French-built two-unit complex at Daya Bay, 50 km northeast of Hong Kong, went on line over the winter and is now delivering electricity to China Light & Power.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="30"> The second unit is now completed and is being prepared for commercial operation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="31"> A further complex is planned nearby, also to be foreign built.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="32"> A further complex of similar size is being planned for Yangjiang, near Macau, west of Hong Kong.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="33"> China is also operating a separate 300MW domestically- engineered reactor in the northeast and is planning new home-built units of 600MW each, with consultancy help from Electricite de France.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="34"> In all, it hopes to see some 7,500MW of nuclear capacity operating or near completion by 2005.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="35"> A major reason for the reliance on foreign help is the fact that China's own power equipment manufacturers are operating at full tilt and producing only mid-range technology.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="36"> For manufacturers, the willingness to transfer technology and form joint ventures with Chinese counterparts will be the key to success.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="37"> According to Nomura Research Institute in Hong Kong, China's manufacturers are capable of producing up to 400MW hydroelectric power generators and thermal electric power generators with a maximum 600MW capacity.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="38"> China's big three equipment makers are China Harbin Power Plant Equipment Group; Shanghai United Electric Corp. and Dongfang Electrical Machinery Works, the last of which is in the process of trading shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="39"> All are understood to be seeking major equity shareholdings from their foreign counterparts.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="40"> It is their output shortfall that has helped open the doors to western hardware supplies, analysts say.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="41"> These imports, which generally cost about 50 per cent more than locally-manufactured goods, are now estimated to contribute about 20 per cent of China's annual installed capacity.</s>

<s docid="FT942-9118" num="42"> Indeed, so serious is the domestic equipment supply problem that China's giant Three Gorges hydroelectric project, which is projected in the early part of the next century to reach 22,000MW, will require at least 12 of its 26 hydraulic turbines to be foreign supplied, say Beijing officials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="29"> In the area of importing capital, China is now studying capital-raising measures for importing foreign buyers' credit and issuing stocks and bonds in China and foreign countries at the appropriate time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="30"> He said that China welcomes foreign enterprises and investment organizations to participate in construction of the Three Gorges project and the Three Gorges reservoir region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="31"> While answering reporters' questions concerning the issue of environmental protection in the Three Gorges region, Guo Shuyan said that construction of the Three Gorges project will have a beneficial effect on the ecology and environment of the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, especially in substantially improving flood control standards and making the water clearer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="32"> What has aroused concern in China and foreign countries is the reservoir inundation and resettled population arrangements that result from the Three Gorges project and the negative impact these will have on the ecology and environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="33"> These have already received a high degree of attention from the Chinese Government and it has formulated the corresponding measures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="34"> He said that on the new land used for production for the resettled population, we will organize the building of rather high-level terraced fields and develop production.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="35"> To reduce soil erosion, the State is now implementing a shelter forest plan for the middle and upper reaches of the Chang Jiang.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="36"> The government will also establish several animal and plant protection regions to protect the valuable animal and plant resources in this region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="37"> Since construction of the Gezhouba project, we have discovered that Chinese sturgeon have established a new spawning ground below the dam and that the related areas are providing additional protection and doing a great deal of artificial breeding and releasing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="38"> A reporter asked whether or not the investment in the Three Gorges project would be a factor that in causing inflation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="39"> For 1993, investment in the Three Gorges project is 2 billion yuan and the average investment each year after construction of the project formally gets underway will be about 5 billion yuan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="40"> While this is a large figure, compared to China's total investments in fixed assets of more than 1 trillion yuan each year, it will only account for about 0.5 percent, so it will not have a significant impact or become a factor in further inflation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="41"> Additional report: According to information provided by State Council Three Gorges Project Construction Commission Deputy Director Guo Shuyan, based on April 1993 price levels, the static investment in the entire Three Gorges project will require about 95.4 billion yuan renminbi.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="42"> Based on policies already promulgated by the Chinese Government, the state will set aside 0.003 yuan per kWh of electricity in China, which can raise an average of 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion yuan renminbi per year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="43"> Moreover, the Gezhouba Power Station has been turned over to the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation and all the net income from the power it generates will be used for the Three Gorges project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-66355" num="44"> These two funding items will provide a total of about 32.7 billion yuan renminbi over 11 years, equal to 62 percent of the required investment in the Three Gorges project over the same period.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45658" num="14"> This was the first opening of tenders for the construction of principal parts of the Three Gorges water control dam, which is expected to take 17 years to finish.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45658" num="15"> The first-phase digging on the left bank of the Chang Jiang consists of three parts -- the first-phase digging for a permanent ship lock and the course linking the upper and middle reaches, the first-stage digging for a ship lift and a temporary ship lock, and the first-phase digging for the workshops and dikes of the no. 1 through to no. 6 hydroelectric stations at the Three Gorges.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45658" num="16"> Eight large Chinese engineering enterprises or company groups participated in the tendering and competed for the rights to undertake the digging according to conditions set by the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation when calling for the tenders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45658" num="17"> To guarantee fairness and objectivity, and also to ensure that the best engineering enterprises are selected, the China International Engineering Consultancy Company has been entrusted by the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Project Development Corporation to be fully responsible for the assessment of all the tenderers this time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="8"> According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Labor (MOL), a record number of petitions for "employment adjustment subsidies" used to pay for "one-time layoffs" were filed by car manufacturers and auto parts makers in FY93.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="9"> Furthermore, after a two-month decline, the number of petitions filed in March 1994 was higher than in February, which is an "indication" that both the economy and auto demand will probably not recover until the second half of FY94.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="10"> (For previous reporting on the auto industry's employment subsidies, see the 9 March 1994 Pacific Rim Economic Review, pages 1-4).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="11"> In April 1993, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (JAPIA) separately petitioned the MOL for "industry designation" so that member firms would be eligible for employment adjustment subsidies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="12"> The first car maker to apply for subsidies did so in October 1993, after which five applied in November, 21 in December, 15 in January, 13 in February, and 16 in March for an total of 71 separate petitions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="13"> An aggregate of 126,028 employees were affected involving 241,862 work-days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="14"> Based on a monthly average, 1,750 employees from each of 12 firms were "laid-off" for 3.3 days in each of five months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="15"> The auto parts industry, which is composed of many small and medium sized firms, has been even more seriously affected by the economic downturn.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="16"> Auto parts makers began petitioning for subsidies as early as May 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="17"> From that time to March 1994, a total of 1,990 petitions were filed, from an average of 180 firms a month, and subsidies were paid covering 225,787 people and 441,532 work-days, which is nearly double that of finished car makers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="18"> Based on a monthly average, 114 employees from each of 180 firms were furloughed for two days in each of 11 months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="20"> The company plans to export over a 1,000 slightly modified three-door hatchback and the two-door coupe Civics to Taiwan and Brazil by yearend and plans to "further increase" the number of autos and their destinations in 1995.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="21"> Honda already sells Canadian cars in the United States, but this will be the first time that Canadian-made cars will be exported to other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="22"> Honda is looking to establish its North American plants as "export bases," so long as currencies remain stable in both Canada and the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="23"> Honda began manufacturing cars in Canada in 1988 and now produces 100,000 Civics annually, of which 80 percent are exported to the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="24"> The company decided to begin exporting from Canada because appreciation of the yen has made Canadian-made Civics more price competitive, and the three-door hatchback model is not produced in the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="25"> (Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 5 May 94 p 6) Aviation Industry - FEATURE: Airlines Restructuring To Break Even -- SUMMARY: Japan's three major airlines--Japan Air Lines (JAL), All Nippon Airways (ANA), and Japan Air System (JAS)--have projected "all-around deficits" for FY93 after final accounting is completed, and all three have frozen new hiring for 1994, according to press reports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="26"> JAL is undertaking large-scale voluntary retirement efforts, and ANA and JAS are trying to come up with new staffing levels and wage structures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="27"> JAL Attempting To Downsize To Regain Profitability -- In January 1993, JAL predicted it would begin turning profits in FY94 after having implemented emergency measures in FY93, according to the 18 April NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="28"> However, JAL has suffered a decline in international business operations, which account for 70 percent of its revenues, and a drop in revenues from first class and business class fares because of Japan's prolonged recession.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="29"> In mid-January, JAL announced a medium-term restructuring plan to reduce its main office staff of 22,000 to 17,000 by the end of 1997.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="30"> It also announced plans to reduce FY94 costs by 100 billion yen ($980 million), cut back considerably on capital investment, and shrink basic wage raises and bonuses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="31"> On 19 April, in a further step to downsize, JAL disclosed an initiative to lower the qualifying age for voluntary retirement to 30 years of age, according to the 20 April YOMIURI SHIMBUN.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="32"> Consequently, 72 percent, or 15,000 of JAL's employees have become eligible for voluntary retirement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="33"> JAL hopes to retire 550 employees this year under this initiative and plans to solicit candidates to retire during two window periods, from May to June and from September to October 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="34"> JAL will offer 1.9 times the "standard retirement pay" to those applying to retire in the May- June window and 1.7 times the amount in the September-October window.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="35"> In general terms, YOMIURI noted, employees could receive between 10 and 16.2 million yen ($98,000-158,000) in retirement pay if they apply during the May-June window and between 8 and 13.5 million yen ($78,000-132,000) during the September-October window period.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="36"> YOMIURI noted that JAL registered a FY92 current loss of 53.8 billion yen ($528 million) and expects a deficit in FY93--for the third consecutive year--of 30 billion yen ($294 million) after final accounting is completed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="37"> The 20 April NIKKEI SANGYO also observed that because of the yen's rapid appreciation, JAL "will be no competition" against foreign airlines unless it reduces personnel costs to 15 yen per available-payload-ton-kilometer (ATK).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="38"> In FY93, JAL's personnel costs were 20 yen per ATK.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="39"> One yen in personnel costs per ATK is equivalent to 10 billion yen ($98 million), which means that JAL will have to reduce its personnel expenses by 50 billion yen ($490 million) in order to remain globally competitive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="40"> In other restructuring projects, JAL is considering variations in job contracts such as rotating groups of employees or distributing work among employees by consignment (19 April NIKKEI SANGYO).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="41"> It has formed a nine-member project team to design a new merit-based wage system by the end of May (20 April NIKKEI SANGYO) and a JAL subsidiary which offers vocational classes for flight attendants is grooming its students for jobs with foreign airlines (25 April ASAHI).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="42"> JAL has also decided to purchase seven 150-passenger Boeing B737- 400 airplanes by 1997 for 30 billion yen ($294 million) in an effort to boost its share of the domestic air travel market to 40 percent, according to the 29 April NIKKEI.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="43"> JAL currently uses B747s, DC10s, and B767s on its domestic routes, but has decided the smaller B737- 400's are better suited for the considerably lower volume of travelers on domestic routes between regional airports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="44"> The B737- 400 also requires less fuel and is less noisy than current planes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="45"> ANA Experiencing 'Worst Crisis' in Its History -- The 5 May ASAHI SHIMBUN reported that ANA, Japan's second largest airline, expects to turn a profit of 3 billion yen ($29 million) in FY93.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="46"> However, ASAHI explained ANA is actually operating at a loss because the revenues that pushed it into the black came from selling its planes to a leasing company.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="47"> Now, however, ANA must lease back its planes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="48"> According to the 18 April NIKKEI SANGYO, ANA is in the midst of "the worst crisis since it was established".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="49"> The 20 April NIKKEI SANGYO reported that ANA recently eliminated two departments and 11 sections at its main office as part of restructuring measures decided in February.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="50"> ANA President Seiji Fukatsu is seeking reforms to "create a structure that endures even if the slow growth trend in the industry continues".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="51"> Specifically, according to ANA's personnel director, "personnel expenses will have to be restrained" because competition is expected to become more severe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="52"> NIKKEI SANGYO reported that, in early May, a project team of six to seven ANA pilots will begin working on a new personnel wage system to replace the "65-hour guarantee system" ANA currently uses to pay its pilots and flight attendants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="53"> This system, a "company relic" from 30 years ago, guarantees pilots and attendants a minimum of 65 flight hours each month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="54"> ANA management has determined that the average actual time spent in flight is 55 hours for pilots and 60 hours for attendants and believes it is "irrational" to guarantee hours not spent in actual flight.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="55"> ANA plans to present a new wage structure to its labor unions for negotiation by this fall.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="56"> JAS Trying To Balance Personnel Expenses, Staffing Requirements -- According to the 22 April NIKKEI, Japan's third largest airline, JAS, announced that its FY93 current loss of 12.6 billion yen ($123.5 million) was 4.4 billion ($43 million) less than its FY93 mid-year forecast because of an unexpected 2.2 percent rise in the number of passengers during the second half of FY93.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-47629" num="57"> JAS is striving to break even in FY94 by shrinking its staff down to 5,500 and by reexamining operations on "inefficient routes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="15"> [Text] Hong Kong, Feb 9 (AFP) -- China's controversial Three Gorges hydroelectric dam on the Chang Jiang River could be scaled down or shelved if its number-one advocate, Premier Li Peng, falls from political grace, a British expert on the project said Wednesday.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="16"> "If there was a significant change in political leadership, I don't think anybody would really want to develop the Three Gorges dam in the same way Li Peng has said," Patrick O'Reilly of London's School of Oriental and African Studies said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="17"> "I think it could get scaled down.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="18"> I think it could even be sidelined," he told a Foreign Correspondents Club luncheon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="19"> Li, a Soviet-trained electrical engineer who belongs to Beijing's conservative faction, is widely seen as the driving force behind the 20-year, 10 billion US dollar attempt to harness China's longest and mightiest river.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="20"> Last weekend Li presided over the inauguration of another of his pet projects, the Daya Bay nuclear power plant, northeast of Hong Kong, built with French technology for four billion US dollars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="21"> Political analysts say his future will be cast in doubt in the power struggle that is certain to emerge in Beijing after the death of China's present senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is 89.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="22"> Once mooted by Mao Zedong, the Three Gorges project was approved by China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in 1992, a year after devastating floods swept the fertile lower half of the Chang Jiang.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="23"> So big is its size -- 185 meters (yards) high by nearly two kilometers (1-1/4 miles) wide -- that O'Reilly called it "the last Stalinist infrastructure project" in the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="24"> In political terms, Beijing is looking upon the 18,200-megawatt dam as a way to break provincial-level control of China's power generating capacity, said O'Reilly, who is preparing a doctoral thesis on the venture.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="25"> It also hopes to use it to create a new, east-west "axis" of development along the Chang Jiang -- stretching from coastal Shanghai to inland Chongqing city -- to counter-balance the fast-growing South China coast, he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="26"> Most of its electricity output is to go downriver, mainly to Shanghai.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="27"> But resistance to the project remains strong inside China, O'Reilly noted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="28"> Sichuan province, on the west side of the dam, is unhappy that it will get only 10 percent of its electricity output, but 80 percent of the 1.13 million river-dwellers to be displaced by its construction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="29"> There are also strong doubts among China's own professionals, even though O'Reilly said the country has the expertise to get the job done.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="30"> "When we talk to engineers off the record, they're all saying, `Look, it shouldn't be built, but if we're told it's got to happen, it's got to happen'," the scholar said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="31"> Impoverished peasants now trying to eke a living from the barren slopes upriver from the dam could also emerge as a political force to be reckoned with if their relocation to new plots of land is badly handled.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="32"> If the peasants refused to move in protest, they could gain political support from other disgruntled groups in Chinese society, such as students, O'Reilly said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="33"> Other outspoken Three Gorges opponents include dissident intellectuals who were forced underground after the ill-fated Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-26655" num="34"> Many critics say China's pressing energy needs could be dealt with more effectively, and with less cost and damage to the environment, with smaller dams along the Chang Jiang's many tributaries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="18"> Its economy is developing in a spectacular way".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="19"> In 1993, China's economic development has maintained its momentum of rapid growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="20"> Statistics show that the Chinese economy has been growing at double-digit rates for 23 months running since Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks during his inspection tour of South China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="21"> The economic growth rate for the year 1993 is expected to be around 13.3 percent, and annual GNP is expected to exceed 3 trillion yuan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="22"> At the end of the year, news from various parts of the Chinese countryside is that apart from cotton, major agricultural products such as grain and oil-bearing crops have all seen good results.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="23"> In 1993, our country's opening up to the outside world has continued to develop in depth, in diverse spheres and in all directions, and has exhibited even greater vigor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="24"> At present, areas totaling nearly 500,000 square km have been opened up to the outside world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="25"> Some 320 million people live in these areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="26"> A Public Security Bureau spokesman announced in Beijing on 12 November that the State Council had recently approved the opening up of a further 134 cities and counties to the outside world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="29"> On 15 November, customs sources said that effective 31 December, China would reduce tariffs on another batch of products (in other words, China voluntarily announced tax cuts on imported goods).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="30"> It is understood that this tariff readjustment involves 2,898 items of dutiable goods, including some raw materials in short supply in China and machinery and equipment that are in great demand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="32"> Reportedly the State Council's aim in reducing tariffs of its own volition is to "promote the liberalization of world trade and promote the merging of the Chinese economy with the world economy".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="33"> On 22 November, the responsible person of the State Council's Special Economic Zones Office pointed out: The work of consolidating development zones has been brought to a temporary close.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="34"> According to consolidated statistics of 26 provinces and municipalities, the number of unauthorized development zones established by local governments at and below the provincial level totaled 2,050.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="44"> The development of Shanghai in general and Pudong in particular attracted worldwide attention in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="45"> It is understood that by the end of October 1993, foreign investors from 44 countries and regions had established 3,031 foreign-funded enterprises and shareholding companies in Shanghai, with investment totaling $6.124 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="46"> The development of the economic belt along the Chang Jiang Basin subsequent to the economic takeoff of Shanghai and Pudong has also aroused universal attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="47"> In spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference met in Beijing and the "socialist market economy" affirmed by the 14th CPC National Congress was written into the Constitution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="49"> The target of establishing a socialist market economy has fueled the enthusiasm of the people in town and country, and has become a driving force for the development of production this year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="51"> First, preparations for the Three Gorges Project -- the relocation of residents and the construction of preliminary cofferdams -- have been unleashed in an all-round way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="52"> Sources say that this huge project, which involves a static investment of 500 billion yuan, 17 years of construction and a total installed capacity of 17.68 million kw, will go full steam ahead next year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="54"> Construction of the "Beijing-Kowloon Railway" is in full swing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="55"> It is reported that more than 120,000 workers from 16 engineering bureaus under the Ministry of Railways and from local railroad construction units are taking part in the construction of this 2,370-km project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="56"> By December, 88 km of bridges, 8 km of tunnels, 213 km of main-line single tracks and 40 km of side tracks had been completed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="57"> Construction of the whole project has seen swift and satisfactory progress.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="58"> On the basis of a successful first battle, there should not be any problem realizing the goal of "completing the track- laying in three years and finishing up the project (and opening the railroad to traffic) one year afterward".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="59"> The development of production has brought about an improvement in the people's livelihood.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="60"> Statistics for the third quarter show a further increase in the income of urban and rural inhabitants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="61"> After allowing for price rises, the living expenditure income of urban inhabitants was up 12 percent and that of rural inhabitants was up about 5 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="62"> China's urban and rural markets have continued to "bloom" in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="63"> According to statistics, at the end of October, total retail sales were 968.7 billion yuan, up 22.4 percent (from the same period last year, and the same below), or 9.3 percent after allowing for price rises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="64"> The living standards of urban inhabitants have seen steady improvement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="65"> According to the Economic Research Center under the State Planning Commission, food consumption by Chinese urban inhabitants has reached average international standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="66"> Their consumption of clothing, articles of everyday use and durable consumer goods has also reached or surpassed the average for middle- income countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="67"> The amount of durable consumer goods possessed by urban inhabitants has reached the level of Japan in the seventies, meaning that China has achieved a modest level of prosperity ahead of schedule.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="68"> In Lhasa alone, 80 percent of households have color television sets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="69"> This percentage is higher than that in France.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="70"> Total personal consumption of gold in China ranks first in the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="71"> Another indicator of the profound changes in economic life is that the word "market" has become one of the most oft-repeated words in China in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="72"> The number of topics around the concept of "market" that have sprung up in China's economic construction and reform that has become a miracle in world economic history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="73"> Comrade Deng Xiaoping told foreign guests back in 1979 that socialism can also operate a market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="74"> In present-day China, the scope of the "market" deployment of social resources is rapidly expanding, while the scope of "control" of the planned distribution of capital goods is steadily shrinking.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="75"> The birth and gradual perfection of the rolled steel market, the coal market, the nonferrous metal market, the timber market and other markets have put an end to the situation where the state has highly centralized and unified control over everything.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="76"> Small commodities markets and farm produce markets are developing like a prairie fire.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="77"> Even the China National Nuclear Corporation has followed the footsteps of China's aerospace industry and started edging its way into the international market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="78"> While strictly adhering to international standards regarding "the peaceful utilization" of nuclear energy, China has begun exporting nuclear power technology to Pakistan and Iran, signed cooperation agreements on the peaceful use of nuclear energy with 12 countries, and established ties of exchange and cooperation with many countries and regions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="79"> Reform promotes development, and development is conducive to the promotion of reform.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="80"> Against the background of an ample supply of commodities and an increase in people's incomes, price reform that has a direct bearing on the public interest has also been making big strides forward in a peaceful atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="81"> Some economists point out that although the year 1993 has seen the expansion of investment and inflation, it has also seen the number of commodities controlled by the state slashed to less than 30 from 722 in the past.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="82"> To them, it was "beyond one's wildest dreams" that the price reform could have succeeded in such a basically smooth manner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="83"> According to a survey of 1,539 households in the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai between 15 August and 10 September by the authorities concerned, 54.5 percent of residents have their own consumption plans and panic buying of the magnitude seen in 1988 would be unlikely even if prices were to go still higher.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="84"> The reasons given by respondents are as follows: 1) Price hikes occur regularly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="85"> "Panic-buying works for a short time, but you cannot panic-buy all your life".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="86"> Experts say that this is because "the tolerance level of the public has been greatly raised".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="87"> 2) With ample supplies on the market, there is no need to panic-buy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="88"> 3) Some people say they have a small income and do not have the money to panic-buy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="89"> 4) People believe that the state will take measures to curb soaring prices.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="90"> 5) People have basically purchased all major durable consumer goods and there is nothing more to panic-buy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="91"> 6) There are many other popular avenues of investment, such as shares and bonds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="92"> The abolition of grain coupons can best illustrate the point.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="93"> For more than 40 years, grain coupons were the most important of the various negotiable instruments next to the renminbi.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="94"> However, in the past dozen years or so it seems that in an instant grain coupons have changed from certificates with no specific price to a "second renminbi" for exchanging for eggs, and then ceased being used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="95"> Since 1992, some provinces have declared grain coupons "invalid".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="96"> In 1993, the Beijing People's Government also announced that grain coupons would no longer be used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="97"> The invalidation of grain coupons in Chinese cities, including Beijing, has not led to social unrest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="140"> Because of this, alarms signals were rung in May and June 1993 on the economic front, particularly the financial front: The lack of cash for the purchase of summer grain meant that more "white slips" were likely to be issued; urban and rural savings registered a sharp fall; "green slips" involving huge amounts were issued in postal remittance; enterprises faced a shortage of circulating funds; the ratio of the provisional funds of banks (the ratio between surplus reserves and deposits) showed an obvious decline; the financial order was chaotic; unauthorized financing, inter-borrowing and appropriation of funds reached "a stage of insanity," with unauthorized interbank borrowing amounting to hundreds of billions of yuan....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="243"> The "50-Point Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pushed the reform of state-owned enterprises to a new stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="244"> Its major measure, namely the "promotion of a modern enterprise system," involves the establishment of a modern enterprise system which caters to the needs of the market economy, a system based on scientific management where property rights, powers and responsibilities are clearly defined and where the government does not directly interfere with the managerial activities of enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="245"> This will be the basis for the establishment of the socialist market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="246"> The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a natural requirement in the development of socialized mass production and a market economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="247"> It is the direction of China's enterprise reform, and covers three major aspects: First, the establishment of enterprises as legal entities; second, the establishment of a system of limited liability; and third, the establishment of a scientific enterprise organizational system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="248"> This arduous and complicated undertaking requires the accumulation of experience and the creation of the necessary conditions, and should be conducted step by step.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="249"> At present, it is necessary to continue to implement the Enterprise Law and the "Regulations" on changing the management mechanism of industrial enterprises owned by the whole people, and to extend to enterprises the various rights and responsibilities pertaining to their management.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="250"> For state-owned enterprises, it is useful to experiment with the corporate system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="251"> However, introduction of the corporate system does not simply mean a change of name.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="252"> The important thing is the shifting of mechanism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="253"> Enterprises that do not have the necessary conditions cannot be arbitrarily turned into corporate entities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="254"> Only a small number of them can be turned into publicly listed limited-liability companies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="255"> The specific tentative plan is as follows: The small number of large enterprises that are making good profits, are highly efficient in management and are in accord with the state's industrial policies should be directly reorganized into limited-liability shareholding companies with the state holding controlling or partial shares.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="256"> The majority of competitive enterprises that are in accord with the state's industrial policies should be organized into limited- liability companies funded by the state and other legal entities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="257"> Companies that turn out special-category products should be turned into limited-liability companies solely funded by the state.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="258"> Small state-owned enterprises in general may also be reorganized through such methods as leasing, contracting, sale, and lease-purchase, or turned into shareholding cooperatives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="259"> State-owned enterprises that have long been performing poorly and producing unmarketable goods, have more liabilities than assets and cannot be reorganized through other means must be declared bankrupt in accordance with law....</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="260"> These measures represent a major breakthrough in both theoretical and practical terms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="261"> At the end of 1993, the head of the State Economic and Trade Commission disclosed at the National Economic and Trade Work Conference the following plans for the shifting of mechanism in 1994: Steps will be taken to implement to the letter the 14 types of operational autonomy and responsibility in 10,000 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and to complete the work of inventory-taking.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="262"> "Monitoring committees" will be dispatched in groups and stages to 1,000 key enterprises with a vital bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood to monitor their state-owned assets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="263"> Further, 100 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises of different categories will be selected for the trial implementation of the modern enterprise system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="264"> At present, apart from planning to systematically reorganize the organizational and managerial structures of state-owned enterprises in accordance with the "corporate system," the state also plans to make a "major move" in the reform of the financial and taxation systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="265"> It is understood that this will be "one of the tasks in the reform of the state macrocontrol system next year".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="266"> This will include the following three tasks: First, replace the existing financial contract system with the revenue-sharing system; second, unify the income tax rate for all types of enterprises and introduce a system of turnover tax with value-added tax as the mainstay; and third, reform the taxation system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="267"> It is learned that nine localities are currently experimenting with the "revenue-sharing system".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="268"> In the reform of the financial system, the main task is to establish as quickly as possible a central banking system which will independently implement state monetary policies under the leadership of the State Council, and strive to turn specialized banks into commercial banks through the organization of policy-lending banks, thus separating the policy-related and commercial businesses of the banking system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="269"> In the reform of the investment system, the main task is to define investment entities and their scope of responsibility in accordance with different spheres of investment, and gradually establish a risk responsibility system for corporate investment and bank credits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="270"> In addition, the 1994 reform program will also involve the further improvement of the market system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="271"> The state will further push forward the price reform and try to eliminate the "dual-track pricing system" for capital goods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="272"> In market development, the state will put the emphasis on the financial, labor, property, technology and information markets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="273"> In addition, the State Economic and Trade Commission has, in accordance with the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, drawn up a "program" for the strengthening of economic regulation and control in 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="275"> China has achieved tremendous successes in economic restructuring and economic development in 1993, but there are still many problems that deserve our attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="276"> According to the State Statistical Bulletin published by the XINHUA News Agency, the following are the major problems in our economic life: First, investment in fixed assets is growing too swiftly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="277"> In the first three quarters, investment by state-owned units totaled 401.5 billion yuan, up 66.4 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="278"> Second, price levels have been soaring.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="279"> Average price hikes were registered at 12 percent at the end of October, or 18.9 percent for 35 large and medium-sized cities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="280"> Third, enterprises are generally short of production and circulating funds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="281"> Some less-competitive enterprises have not been doing well in sales.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="282"> These enterprises are confronted by growing inventories and mounting debts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="283"> Fourth, since little improvement has been made in the conditions of agricultural production, and since the income gap between urban and rural inhabitants is widening and the peasants are not very enthusiastic about farming, the problem of rural employment is becoming more and more serious.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="284"> Unfair distribution and development opportunities have worsened.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="285"> Apart from the fact that the gap between town and country and between east and west is widening, the income gaps between different ownership systems and different industries within the same locality are also widening.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="286"> This not only affects people's choice of jobs, but has also produced a huge "flow of personnel" who are solely motivated by prospects of a higher income.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="287"> This has produced drastic changes in the original employment "hierarchy" (which is not an entirely bad thing).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="288"> Reform is also faced with some problems that are worthy of attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="289"> Some economists pointed out that reform in 1994 would be "the final assault".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="290"> In order to avoid detours and costly lessons, it is necessary to maintain a good economic environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="291"> Experts also pointed out that since some of the new reform measures introduced this year or next year were directed against administrative organs and key departments, whether or not the leading cadres of the organs concerned were willing to resolutely bid farewell to old traditions would have a vital bearing on the success of the reform.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="292"> Some experts also believed that as China's reform had reached a great depth, even reformers themselves had to be highly aware of the need for reform.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="293"> With major reform measures for 1994 about to be introduced, it is necessary to guard against conscious or unconscious attempts by vested interests to distort the reform.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="294"> The appeal made by these experts is: China's reform has entered the most arduous and challenging as well as the most promising stage of final assault.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="295"> We must do well in this stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-45822" num="296"> "Reform has its dangers and difficulties, but we can succeed if we work hard".</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="6"> IN THE middle reaches of the majestic Yangtze river, sheer cliff faces and mountains rise from turbulent waters to form the Three Gorges, an inspiration to Chinese poets and artists down the centuries.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="7"> One of the world's scenic wonders, it is the site of the planned Three Gorges dam, an engineering project - given the go-ahead by the Chinese parliament last Friday - which will not only change the landscape forever, but cost more than 1m people their homes, and swamp 23,800 hectares of arable land, 657 factories and mines, 139 power stations and 956km of roads.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="8"> The scheme, incorporating the biggest hydro-power station and largest ship-lift in the world and an unprecedented five ship locks, is costed at 57bn yuan (Pounds 6bn) at 1990 prices.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="9"> Such is the controversy surrounding it that a third of the deputies in the normally tame National People's Congress failed to give it their rubber-stamp vote.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="10"> The Three Gorges - Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling - will be dominated by the reservoir which will stretch out behind the 185-metre high dam when it reaches the proposed 175-metre water level 15 years from the start of construction.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="11"> The 600km reservoir will be a tranquil body of water, twice the width of the present turbulent river, improved navigation being one of the project's proclaimed benefits.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="12"> Others are flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze - and power, for which China has an insatiable appetite.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="13"> The project will generate 84bn kw/h of hydro-electric power a year, one-eighth of China's 1991 output.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="14"> The water level in Qutang, the smallest and most westerly of the Three Gorges, only 100 metres wide at its narrowest point, is set to rise 90 metres.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="15"> In the hillside town of Wanxian at the western approach to the Gorges, population 30,000, the level the water will reach is marked on buildings.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="16"> Few will be above.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="17"> The town will be re-built back from the river with some of the 18.5bn yuan allocated to resettlement from the project's budget of 57bn yuan.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="18"> Some private scepticism was expressed in Wanxian county, which has a high proportion of all the people to be moved, that the money promised by the central government would be forthcoming.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="19"> The reservoir will flood 19 counties and municipalities in the two provinces of Sichuan and Hubei, swamping hundreds of populated areas, including the cities of Wanxian and Fuling with 100,000 people.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="20"> Altogether 140 towns and hundreds of villages are to go, though officials claim none will be totally submerged.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="21"> The dam will cost 1.13m people their homes by the time the project nears completion in the year 2008.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="22"> Tang Dengqing from the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission in Wuhan, responsible for helping to plan new cities and towns and develop barren land for displaced farmers, says moving so many people is unparalleled in the world.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="23"> It is the most serious of all problems associated with the dam, he says.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="24"> Sites have been chosen for the new cities and an overall broad plan mapped.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="25"> Experiments in moving have been conducted, though reports say people show reluctance to go.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="26"> The new county town of Badong, 2km from the original site, has basically taken shape after five years construction.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="27"> Those to be resettled from urban areas - 60 per cent of the total - are less of a problem than peasant farmers, says Tang.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="28"> Scratching a poor living from terraced plots often high on mountain sides, they must now be moved higher to still less hospitable land.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="29"> There are also conflicts of interest between provinces.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="30"> Hubei province, down-river of the dam gains from flood control, cheap power and new jobs, but has only 15 per cent of the people to be displaced.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="31"> Upriver of the dam the much poorer and heavily populated Sichuan province gets 10 per cent of the power but is home to the remaining 85 per cent of the people to be displaced.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="32"> Sichuan faces an increased risk of flooding, as the water level up-river rises.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="33"> There is an additional risk that the accumulation of silt will affect navigation to Chongqing, Sichuan's largest port.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="34"> Deputy director of the Three Gorges project office in the city, economist Sun Lai Yan, says 50,000 people within the municipal area will have to move.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="35"> Many have urged the government to do more research on the project before going ahead.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="36"> The governor of Sichuan province, Zhang Haoruo, cast his vote for the dam at the weekend, but even he acknowledges the majority of Sichuanese are opposed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="37"> There have been rumours, officially denied, that elder statesman Deng Xiaoping, born in Sichuan, had expressed reservations.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="38"> Through the 40 years of debate since the project was first proposed, uncertainty has inhibited development along the affected area, which remains poor and lacking in investment funds.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="39"> The point is re-iterated by official spokesmen backing the scheme.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="40"> Critics remain concerned about the risk of reservoir-induced earthquakes, the threat of river banks collapsing, and the accumulation of silt in the first 50 years of operation, affecting generating capacity and shortening the dam's useful life.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="41"> Money is another question.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="42"> China can afford it, the minister for water conservancy and power, Yang Zhenhuai, said in Beijing after the vote.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="43"> Funds would come from the state, from the generation of power which would begin nine years after the start of construction, from the sale of bonds and from preferential foreign loans.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="44"> Harnessing the Yangtze has been an aspiration of the Chinese Communist Party since Mao Zedong visited the dam site in the 1950s.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14361" num="45"> The appeal of an heroic project to today's leaders is a powerful impetus behind the largest construction project since the founding of the People's Republic.</s>
