<s docid="FT921-10204" num="6"> TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board of Trade will offer a seminar later this month on El Nino, the weather phenomenon that develops in the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and can cause global climate upsets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="7"> Grain traders are keen to know if they can expect this year's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to make a dent in crop output.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="8"> Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating during 1991, only last month did the the US National Weather Service finally conclude publicly that the phenomenon was a fact.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="9"> The symptoms had been showing themselves overseas since last spring - rising surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific, drought in the western Pacific rim from Australia through Indonesia, a weaker Indian monsoon, dryness in north-eastern Brazil, drought in South Africa and wetness last summer in the Great Basin of the US, which runs from Arizona north to Idaho.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="10"> While many of these conditions indicate that El Nino is occurring, they do not reveal its severity.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="11"> The phenomenon generally peaks in the northern hemisphere's winter.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="12"> This helps explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the phenomenon El Nino, which means Christ child in Spanish.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="13"> It arrived about Christmas time.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="14"> Mr Vernon Kousky, a research meteorologist with the US weather service, now assesses the current El Nino as 'moderate to strong'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="15"> While individual weather events cannot always be directly attributed to El Nino, some signals are indicative of its strength.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="16"> Warm water in the Pacific is pushing moisture into the south-western US, causing, for example, this winter's floods in Texas, according to Mr Art Douglas, chairman of the Creighton University's Atmospheric Sciences Department.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="17"> Along the Gulf of Mexico, from Texas to Florida, some areas have already had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent of their normal rainfall.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="18"> Temperatures in that region are also beginning to dip below normal.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="19"> At the same time the phenomenon is upsetting the Jet Stream, keeping extremely cold air far to the north and moderating temperatures in the Midwest.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="20"> The Midwest, America's most important grain area, is seeing temperatures four or five degrees Fahrenheit above normal, said Mr Jon Davis, the in-house meteorologist for Shearson Lehman's commodities trading arm.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="21"> The weather service predicts that more of the same will occur in those regions until spring and that the usually wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as is the Ohio valley.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="22"> But what concerns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen during the critical planting and growing season for American crops from June to August.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="23"> Unfortunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="24"> Mr Kousky says that El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months to run.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="25"> But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between El Nino and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="26"> 'Anything can happen,' he admits.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="27"> Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service that is used by many US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has already affected South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australian wheat, it is hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effects in the US by looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other climatological events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines and the combination of lunar and solar cycles.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="28"> These additional factors along with El Nino probably mean that a more extreme weather pattern bleeds over into summer, according to Mr Kevin Marcus, director of Crop Cast services.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="29"> He says the likelihood of extreme, hot and dry weather is 100 per cent, but gives only a one in three chance that this will have a significant impact on crops.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="30"> The hot, dry weather would have to occur in July or early August to reduce the maize and soyabean crops significantly, that is by more than 10 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="31"> But Mr Marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will interact since there no established pattern.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="32"> He is still waiting for more data on the severity of this year's El Nino.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="33"> The phenomenon has prompted commodities markets to gyrate in the past.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="34"> In 1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Peruvian fishmeal catch, which then accounted for some 45 per cent of the world trade in protein feed.</s>

<s docid="FT921-10204" num="35"> In 1982-83 it caused a drought in Africa, which helped to send cocoa prices up by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a year.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="6"> BANANA production, the cornerstone of Ecuador's agriculture, is facing change.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="7"> Not only are exports threatened by European restrictions, but domestic overproduction, the Sigatoka disease and low per acre productivity will also demand action by producers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="8"> Last year Ecuador produced a record 3.5m tonnes of bananas.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="9"> The increase over previous years (3m tonnes in 1990 and 2.5m tonnes in 1989) is largely due to new plantations started in 1990 and 1991 - when banana prices rose - and which have now come into production.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="10"> These largely unauthorised plantations are ballooning the supply and depressing prices.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="11"> Of great concern to Ecuador is the reform of the European Community's banana import regime with proposals to impose a banana import quota of 2m tonnes next year and tariff on 'dollar bananas' imported from exporters from Latin America of up to 70 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="12"> Ecuador last year exported 2.7m tonnes of bananas worth nearly Dollars 800m.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="13"> Restrictions would affect a large percentage of Ecuador's banana exports.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="14"> Approximately 40 per cent of the fruit it produces is sold to the EC.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="15"> While the spread of the Black Sigatoka disease, which has endangered the tropical fruit for some time, has been halted, it is not likely to be eradicated.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="16"> Measures introduced by the French Institute of Fruit and Citrus Investigations, part of an aid programme of the French government, have had much success in combating Sigatoka, but have not able to eliminate it completely.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="17"> The productivity of Ecuador's banana fields is below that of its world competitors.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="18"> While the productivity in Honduras is 2,800 boxes per hectare and 3,000 in Costa Rica, Ecuador merely produces 1,400 boxes per hectare.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="19"> Yet lower overall costs make Ecuador competitive internationally.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="20"> To give producers an incentive while continuing to protect consumers, the government is to implement a price reform of the principal agricultural goods whose prices have so far remained fixed.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="21"> Supply and demand will determine the prices of sugar, rice, maize, soya, milk and barley within a certain parameter set by the ministry of agriculture.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="22"> The bottom end of the price bracket will ensure farmers a minimum revenue.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="23"> When prices hit the top end, distributors are allowed to search for cheaper imports on the international market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="24"> The importance of coffee and cacao, which cover nearly a third of the area sown with primary agricultural products, is likely to decrease.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="25"> Given low prices and an over-supply of coffee on world markets, agriculture minister Mr Mariano Gonzales Portes has indicated that some of the coffee cultivations will eventually have to be replaced with other crops.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="26"> In spite of a sugar cane production of over 3.5m tonnes annually, Ecuador has had to import sugar this year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="27"> Producers hope to cover domestic demand next year but need considerable credits from the Andean Development Corporation to do so.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="28"> Few major crops have seen their production increase significantly recently.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="29"> One exception is the soya bean; its production has nearly quadrupled in the past years and is expected to grow in the future.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="30"> One of the reasons producers have not been able to significantly increase the yield of their crops in past years, says Mr Gonzales, has been the lack of sufficient investment in agricultural research.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="31"> Only 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product has gone into agricultural research in the past years, he says.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="32"> The government plans to reverse that trend and, with the help of the Institute of Agricultural Investigations which became autonomous only in July, intends to promote new and higher-yielding agricultural products.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="33"> INIAP has recently developed a new type of yuca whose yield is three times that of the traditional type when processed into flour and 10 times as high when processed into starch.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="34"> The institute also engages in other activities, such as giving technical advice to indigenous groups in the central province of Chimborazo on the cultivation of the traditional crop quinua.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="35"> This cereal, grown by the Incas centuries ago, has a high nutritional value.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="36"> Although a promising crop, the efficient commercialisation of quinua is difficult, says Mr Gonzales, because of the unfavourable size of land parcels in the areas in which quinua is grown.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="37"> Land holdings in the mountainous Sierra region are much smaller than in the coast and are typically used for subsistence farming.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="38"> Thirty per cent of land holdings in the Sierra are classified as small (10 hectares or less), while 52 per cent are medium sized (10 to 100 hectares) and only 18 per cent are more than 100 hectares.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="39"> Land holdings in the coastal provinces of Manabi, Guayas, and Los Rios are generally larger and used in commercial monoculture such as banana, cacao or coffee.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="40"> In the past two-and-a-half decades the amount of land used for livestock production has more than tripled to nearly 5m hectares, which in part explains Ecuador's dazzling rate of deforestation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="41"> Settlers continue to slash-and-burn as a way to clear areas of forest on which to grow beans and maize for one season before turning it into pasture.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="42"> The most rapid expansion of pasture has occured in the coastal areas, especially in the province of Esmeraldas where huge tracts of land have been cleared by settlers as well as lumber companies.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="43"> In the Sierra the increase of pasture is more due to the abandonment of agricultural activities.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="44"> A large potential for growth lies in Ecuador's horticulture, according to Mr Gonzales, especially tropical fruits but also flowers which have found an increasingly strong market in the US and Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="45"> Yet the volatility in the production of such fruits for the export market is exemplified by the Babaco fruit.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="46"> Production in 1987 reached 3,834 tonnes but then steadily declined over the years and in 1991 equalled only 510 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="47"> Although outside the hurricane zone, Ecuador suffers repeatedly from the shifting precipitation patterns caused by the Pacific current El Nino.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="48"> The current carries warmer waters to the coast and causes droughts in some parts of the country and floods in others.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="49"> This year 22 people were killed and 30,000 hectares of rice, banana, cotton and maize crops were lost.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="50"> The damage in the coastal areas alone is estimated to have been Dollars 70m.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="51"> At a time when droughts have caused hydroelectric plants to reduce their output, the government plans to revive a decade-old project to irrigate nearly 30,000 hectares of arable land on the Santa Helena peninsula west of the port city Guayaquil.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="52"> The four dams along the river Daule are also to provide the area with electricity and drinking water.</s>

<s docid="FT924-2561" num="53"> So far Brazil, Italy and Spain have agreed to co-finance the project.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="6"> AMERICAN FARMERS are facing a new year as shrouded in uncertainty as any in recent times.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="7"> The collapse of the Soviet Union puts into jeopardy one of their most lucrative markets; trade war with China is looming; and the condition of the world economy is precarious.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="8"> Negotiators in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are still deadlocked on farm trade reform.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="9"> Even the course of the El Nino weather phenomenon is confounding experts, who worry that it could trigger droughts in some areas at a time when US grain stocks are uncomfortably low.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="10"> At the annual outlook conference of the US Department of Agriculture Department last month, Mr James Donald, head of the USDA's World Agriculture Outlook Board, put an optimistic face on 1992 for American farmers.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="11"> Global crop production would fall but animal output would grow, creating many more hungry mouths to feed, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="12"> Higher grain prices and an increased volume of wheat, soyabean and horticultural product exports would boost the value of farm exports to Dollars 39bn, up 4 per cent from 1991, Mr Donald forecast.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="13"> World commodity demand would increase because of real economic growth of about 2.5 per cent, population growth of 1.7 per cent and a 2 per cent rise in meat output.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="14"> Meanwhile a 'modest increase' could be expected in input prices.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="15"> However, the overall result would be cash returns only 'close' to 1991 levels.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="16"> Mr Robert McElroy, a USDA agricultural economist, predicted a rise in US wheat prices next year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="17"> But he told the conference a threatened drop in other grain prices could lead to an overall drop in incomes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="18"> That would be a further blow to a sector where bankruptcies are continuing at a brisk pace, although not at the rate of the early 1980s.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="19"> Mr Mitchell Morehart, another USDA agricultural economist, acknowledged that the rapid changes in the world had made it 'pretty difficult' to forecast net farm income.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="20"> The drop in US interest rates would benefit some farmers and a possible fall in fuel prices would also help.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="21"> Maize is the largest single component of US farmer price receipts and the republics of the former Soviet Union are still the major wild card in the pack.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="22"> The future of this trade rests on the willingness of the west to provide financial assistance.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="23"> If the west withheld credits mendous,' said Mr Alan Terhaar, executive director of the US Feed Grains Council.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="24"> 'The cumulative effect of lack of trade credits that would cause the Soviets to fall from the projected level to, for example, 5m tonnes of imports would by the end of 1995-96, could cause a build-up of 60m tonnes of US feed grains stocks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="25"> Wheat stocks would face a similar build-up'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="26"> If President Bush took the lead on increasing export guarantees to the former Soviet republics then the subsequent rise in maize prices could actually turn falling farm incomes around.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="27"> With all the uncertainties, Mr Terhaar expected a 'disappointing' outcome for 1991-92 trade.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="28"> Although exports to Mexico had been rising, they were slightly behind expectations of 7.5m tonnes per year by 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="29"> Furthermore, he was keeping a close watch on proposed changes to Mexico's ejido (communal farm) land tenure system.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="30"> 'Even two years ago it would have been inconceivable that Mexico would ever change its ejido system, which dates back to that country's revolution,' Mr Terhaar said.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="31"> The system had been 'considered an insurmountable impediment' to higher Mexican production, but a proposal to introduce privatisation into the system could have 'far reaching consequences for the make-up of crop and livestock production'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="32"> Mr Terhaar was hopeful about increased exports to Egypt, since US debt forgiveness and an emerging private sector had strengthened the market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="33"> Eastern Europe offered some possibility of new markets in the short term but it could not afford to buy much.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="34"> Australia, South Africa and Thailand appeared to be moving away from feed grains exports, but the Asian market posed another concern for the US.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="35"> Japan's tariff quota on imports of maize for industrial processing and layers of regulations and secondary tariffs on feed grain might indicate 'we have simply reached a plateau in Japanese imports.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="36">. . or we are entering a period of significant decline'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="37"> In Korea the US was facing China as a major competitor, while China was maintaining firm control on import volume into the south, where economic growth rates in excess of 20 per cent were causing an explosion in demand.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="38"> Mr Terhaar was 'bullish' that China would succumb to economic and political pressures to open its market to feed grain imports.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="39"> Currently it was importing 800,000 tonnes of barley for malt production, and demand was growing by more than 100,000 tonnes a year.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="40"> The likeliest bet is that election year politics will prevail and US farmers will not be allowed to suffer unduly in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="41"> If history repeats itself - and why not? - then the Republican administration and Democratic Congress will join forces to ensure that the Midwest and the Sunbelt states, major electoral battlegrounds, will get sticking plasters for their pain.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16395" num="42"> Already there have been calls in Congress for export subsidy re-armament.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="7"> THE DROUGHT that has ravaged crops and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in countries across Asia and the South Pacific appears to be over, meteorologists say, reports Reuter from Sydney.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="8"> Its cause, the climatic phenomenon known as El Nino, is dissipating with some areas returning to normal weather conditions more quickly than others, they said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="9"> Australia is among the first of the major agricultural producers to emerge from drought in most areas, while in India a return to normal rainfall is expected in the late monsoon.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="10"> China's northern provinces are still in the grip of drought, however, though it is unlikely to have much impact on the country's international trading position.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="11"> 'We're now in the declining phase of El Nino, it's global and it has had an effect since early last year all round the planet, particularly in the tropical regions,' an official at Australia's National Climate Centre said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="12"> Ocean waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which had warmed under El Nino were continuing to cool quite rapidly, the climate centre reported.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="13"> Australia, whose farm sector was ravaged by drought and economic recession, has already felt the effect of the changing conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="14"> 'Australia tends to climb out of it earlier than others,' the official said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="15"> Drought conditions still persist in some areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland but local output of grain and sugar is forecast to recover significantly after last year's drought across eastern Australia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="16"> The total value of wheat, coarse grains and sugar is forecast to rise by nearly 30 per cent to ADollars 3.14bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the year to the end of June, 1993, compared with the previous drought-hit year.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="17"> In India however, the change is taking longer to come through.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="18"> 'It is expected to come back to average in the late monsoon season,' Australia's climate centre official said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14358" num="19"> Erratic rains in India last year caused food grain output to fall to about 171m tonnes in the year to June 30, 1992 from the previous year's record 176m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="13"> As San Diego broke a record for heat Wednesday -- the high at Lindbergh Field reached 91 degrees, surpassing the mark of 1976 -- the weathered weather types scrambled to find out why.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="14"> "This has certainly been an unusual month," said Dan Atkin, meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="15"> "It's been the wettest June ever in San Diego, and that was from one storm.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="16"> And now we've got this heat".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="17"> Atkin said San Diego received 0.38 of an inch of rain on June 9, followed by 0.48 of an inch the next day, breaking two daily records.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="18"> The accumulated 0.86 of an inch set a monthly record.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="19"> "In average years," Atkin said, "June is our cloudiest month of the year.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="20"> On the average, the smallest amount of possible sunshine we receive in San Diego is 57%.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="21"> We don't have complete figures yet, but this June has been much sunnier than normal".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="22"> Atkin said the traditional June Gloom is caused by a blast of heat welling up from the desert and coming into conflict with "very cool air over the water.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="23"> At the same time, high pressure is starting to form, which traps the marine air.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="24"> In July and August, we usually break through the (temperature) inversion, and it gets much, much hotter.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="25"> This year, it happened earlier".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="26"> Atkin said the temperature this time of year usually hovers around 73 degrees.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="27"> He speculated that part of the extreme conditions, not just here but nationally, is caused by El Nino and the greenhouse effect.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="28"> Not just summers, but winters, too, Atkin said, are now more severe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="29"> Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with Weatherdata Inc. in Wichita, Kan.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="30"> , which supplies weather information for The Times, believes the greenhouse effect and El Nino -- as well as its "female" counterpart, La Nina -- have had a profound effect on weather nationwide, particularly in the Southwest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="31"> Hibbert defines the greenhouse effect as "man's influence on the environment, where industrial processes and consumer excesses have generated gases that tend to absorb solar radiation rather than let it transfer freely".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="32"> "El Nino is the shifting of temperatures on the surface of the sea," Hibbert said.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="33"> "People generally don't recognize that oceans cover three-fourths of the planet's surface, receiving three-fourths of the sunlight that shines on the Earth at any given time.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="34"> Normally, El Nino affects Southern California with much wetter weather.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="35"> "What people don't know as much about is La Nina, which imposes the opposite condition.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="36"> That produces a cooling of (ocean) surface temperatures, resulting in excessively dry weather, which you're now having in Southern California," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="37"> "Both can be equally virulent, especially with both occurring in conjunction with other weather patterns.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="38"> What you have to remember is, with weather, nothing stands alone -- everything is interconnected.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0007" num="39"> And, whatever the connection is, at the moment, it's producing extreme heat and very dry conditions in Southern California.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="12"> Near Point Loma in San Diego, the waters are providing a unique harvest of such exotic species as yellowfin tuna and dorado, prompting commercial fisherman Lance Withee to say he has "never seen the ocean like this before".</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="25"> Still others are concerned that the warm water may be a harbinger of El Nino, a Pacific Ocean weather pattern that causes severe drought in some areas of the Pacific Rim and devastating storms in others.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="26"> Southern California has experienced a slackening of strong westerly winds, which normally blow across the ocean and churn the deeper, colder water.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="27"> The resulting "upwelling" cools the shallower warm water.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="28"> Without the wind, the upper layer of ocean water becomes tepid -- an explanation offered by Newport Beach Marine Safety officer Gordon C. Reed.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="30"> But others suggest that the warming is the result of an errant current that is also dragging to the Southern California coastline an array of exotic marine life.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="31"> Marine biologist Jeff Landsman, with the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, said that he and other researchers have noted unusual ocean life that seems to be associated with the warm water.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="32"> Thousands of South American Humboldt squid were beached near San Onofre in the summer, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="33"> Another striking example was the discovery of the starfish, a Tamaria obstipa, off Catalina by Landsman's colleague, Lloyd Ellis.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="34"> The creature is native to coastal waters off Peru.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="35"> Finds like that have prompted Landsman and other scientists to conclude that the warmer-than-normal water might be the result of an off-season flow of the Davidson Countercurrent, which pushes water northward from Baja California in February.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="36"> "There's too much out there to believe that it's just the lack of winds," Landsman said.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="37"> "I don't believe that it's upwelling that is causing this".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="38"> Whatever the reason, the tropical-like waters have been a boon to such beachgoers as 19-year-old Jason Smith, an avid Newport Beach surfer.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="44"> Withee, who owns and operates the Vagabond, an 80-foot sportfishing boat out of Point Loma, said he has caught tropical fish without having to travel hundreds of miles south.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="45"> "It's never before been like this," Withee said.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="49"> Fishermen also report higher than normal concentrations of yellowtail tuna.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="50"> Zeke Grader, executive director for the Sausalito-based Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, said the catches are helping the $1.5-billion commercial fishing industry as well as sports fishermen.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="51"> But Grader said that if the unseasonably warm temperatures continue, important colder-water fish may be driven away.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="52"> For example, experts say a small squid that spawns off Santa Catalina Island in the winter would be threatened by the warmer water.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="53"> "It's hard to say whether we are looking at something unusual," Grader said, "but we're watching very carefully the water conditions".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="54"> Grader said that the last time warm water hurt the fishing industry was in 1982-83, when a strong El Nino -- the worst such weather system in the century -- devastated the salmon harvest.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="55"> Scripps researchers said that fears of an impending El Nino are ill-placed.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="58"> Absent are other signs of the phenomenon -- called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO -- which are found in the equatorial and eastern Pacific regions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="59"> For an El Nino to take place, Graham said, barometric pressure in the area of Darwin, Australia, must rise and pressure over Tahiti must fall.</s>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="60"> Neither condition has occurred.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110390-0071" num="61"> In addition, El Nino is associated with increased rainfall in the central equatorial Pacific, elevated sea surface temperatures from South America to the international date line and weaker easterly winds along the Equator, Graham said.</s>

<s docid="LA080890-0116" num="57"> "Divers first noticed -- and began spearing -- the dorado about a month ago off Dana Point," said Jay Riffe, a spear-gun manufacturer and member of the Long Beach Neptunes Dive Club.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080890-0116" num="59"> Riffe, who once held the world record for a spear-shot dorado, said they make easy targets because of their curiosity toward divers and their broad profile.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080890-0116" num="60"> Because catches among sportfishers were not constant, and the eight- to 12-mile boat rides left little time for alternative fishing, dorado were not heavily targeted.</s>

<s docid="LA080890-0116" num="72"> The reasons dorado have migrated well north of their habitat -- tropical and subtropical waters -- are not difficult to explain, experts say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080890-0116" num="73"> Ron Dotson, a migratory species expert with the National Marine Fisheries Service, said last week that the lack of prolonged westerly winds in recent weeks has served to warm the surface temperature four or five degrees above normal.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="9"> Two stormy nights in a week do not a rainy season make, but some climate experts are wondering whether the trace amounts of rain that fell six days apart in Southern California and other changes in weather patterns signal an end to the region's four-year chain of dry winters.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="10"> Despite continuing concern about the prospects for a fifth drought year in California, weather and water experts said that, at least on paper, there appear to be improved conditions for a wetter rainy season.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="11"> Among encouraging indications they cited were movement by a coastal high-pressure system toward the central Pacific Ocean, evidence that El Nino warming conditions are under way off the coast, and a spate of small storms across the West.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="12"> "The possibilities are there," said Jerry McDuffie, deputy meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Los Angeles bureau, "but they could disappear in a hurry.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="13"> You never know in this business".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="14"> Weather and water experts also cautioned that a failure to at least match average rainfall over the next three crucial wet-season months could lead to the driest year yet.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="15"> An average snowfall of 52 inches a year in the Sierra Nevada is essential to provide water for the southern part of the state, but so far, precipitation is running more than 7 inches below average.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="16"> "We need something in the bucket we can really count on," said Maurice Roos, the state's chief hydrologist.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="17"> The two rainfalls in Southern California -- dropping just 0.19 of an inch on downtown Los Angeles last Tuesday and early Monday -- are at least a start, experts said.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="18"> "They need to hang around a little longer," McDuffie said.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="19"> "It's the two- to three-day storms that are the ones we want".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="20"> One reason the storms blew through so quickly, meteorologists said, was the high-pressure system lingering in the upper atmosphere over the central Pacific.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="21"> In recent dry winters, that system was closer to the California coast, acting as a shield and preventing moist air from pouring in at lower elevations.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="22"> But with the system now farther out in the Pacific, there are more chances for not only the sort of brief showers that fell on Southern California, but also for heavier rainstorms of the kind that caused flooding last weekend in Washington.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="23"> "We still don't have an ideal situation for heavy rains, but it's certainly improved," said Mike Smith, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="24"> Smith and other experts also pointed to warming sea surface temperatures as a sign that El Nino conditions are starting again.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="25"> El Ninos -- Pacific Ocean temperature fluctuations near the Equator that are linked to changes in low-level atmospheric patterns -- may set favorable conditions for more rainfall, meteorologists say.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="26"> Experts cautioned that El Ninos do not necessarily bring more rain.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="27"> "We've had cases of heavy and light precipitation associated with El Nino conditions," said Dan Cayan, a climate researcher with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="28"> "All we can say for sure is that if these conditions last, there are some changes in store".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="29"> The early Monday rainfall brought no more than 0.02 of an inch to downtown Los Angeles, but was accompanied by cold temperatures and biting winds that hinted of winter weather to come.</s>

<s docid="LA112790-0036" num="32"> And by Wednesday, temperatures will begin a warming trend that will rise into the 80s by the weekend, he said.</s>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="9"> With the memories of severe winter storms of the 1980s firmly etched in their minds, homeowners along Laguna Beach's scenic Crescent Bay are praying that the next few months will spare them the storm-induced devastation of the past.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="10"> Because if a new wave of storms does bash the south Orange County coastline, homeowners Jim Lund, Ann McDonald, Jim McNaughton and others who live along the picturesque cove fear that they could suffer major property damage.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="11"> And they are frustrated that the city won't let them take action to protect their multimillion-dollar homes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="12"> While talk continues on a permanent shore-protection device, the City Council has rejected plans by the homeowners for an interim solution: the placement of 1 1/2 tons of sandbags at the base of the bluff through the winter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="13"> "I think we are just going to give up and keep our fingers crossed and pray," McNaughton said after a recent council vote.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="14"> Perched on top of cliffs 30 feet to 90 feet above the beach, the multilevel homes serve as the backdrop for the beach that is a favorite spot of locals and tourists alike.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="15"> But like other environmental causes in Laguna Beach that whip up the emotions of its citizens, even a temporary shore-protection device has been opposed by environmentalists who fear it will hurt the shoreline's natural beauty.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="16"> And some citizens have raised doubts that an "El Nino" -- a Pacific Ocean weather pattern that causes severe drought in some areas of the Pacific Rim and devastating storms in others -- will actually occur.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="17"> The need for an emergency measure, they said, simply does not exist.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="18"> "If you base it on historical records," Javier Weckmann, an engineer hired by the homeowners, argued recently, "the frequency of storms that cause problems in California occur every three years".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="19"> Weckmann said record high tides are expected Dec. 31 and "El Nino" systems can be expected every three to seven years.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="20"> The last one, he said, occurred in 1983.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="21"> Another series of storms pounded the coastline in 1988.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="22"> "If we get any kind of significant storms, it's catastrophic," he added.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="23"> But while there is opposition to the construction of a seawall or other device, there is little argument from opponents that the bluffs have eroded.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="24"> "If we are lucky, we will not get hit (by a major storm).</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="25"> But if we do, we will have another Lagunita," McDonald said, referring to the January, 1988, storm that undermined the foundations of some homes in a section of South Laguna.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="26"> One house lost a porch, another lost a bathroom, and several were condemned as a result of that storm, Weckmann said last week.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="27"> Following that disaster, six Crescent Bay residents whose homes face south and are more vulnerable to a South Pacific storm system banded together to hire Weckmann and seek city approval for a permanent shore-protection device.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="28"> A report submitted by the consultant to the council in August stated that Crescent Bay had two slope failures as the result of storms in 1982 and 1983 and that up to 55 feet of sea cliffs have been lost to storm wave erosion since 1931.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="29"> And after numerous discussions with the Design Review Board and council, the residents received an acknowledgment of the problem from city staffers and other officials.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="30"> But citizens and council members worried that a 380-foot seawall in four segments would not help and instead cause further erosion in the cove.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="31"> Because not all the homeowners in the bay support the installation of a seawall -- some homeowners have very old seawalls that provide adequate protection -- there is fear that the force of the waves might divert the water around the edges of the wall and undermine those areas left unprotected by the new structure.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="32"> Former mayor Jon Brand, a member of the environmental group Village Laguna, said there is also the concern about aesthetics.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="33"> "Seawalls on pristine beaches are bad," he said recently.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="34"> The council in August ordered that a lengthy environmental impact report be conducted before deciding whether to allow the construction of a permanent shore-protection device.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="35"> But with the threat of winter storms still facing them, the residents retreated and came back with proposed temporary solutions, the last being the placement of sandbags through the end of April.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="36"> "Staff still believes that some reasonable precautionary level of protection is warranted," Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick and City Manager Kenneth C. Frank stated in a memo to the council recommending approval.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="37"> As council members ran their fingers last week through a sample bag of sand collected from underneath a runway at Los Angeles International Airport, Weckmann explained that it would match the color and texture of the sand already on the beach.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="38"> Once the storm season had passed, the bags would be torn open and the sand would be left on the shore.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="39"> Although the residents have agreed to the environmental impact report, Weckmann protested to the council that the city has never required an environmental impact report for seawalls, including one now being built at Heisler Park.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="40"> But Councilman Robert F.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="41"> Gentry responded that unlike Crescent Bay, the Heisler Park project will not cut into the available beach space because the base of the bluff is made up of rocks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="42"> Butterwick also said later that the study was needed because of the magnitude of the project.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="43"> Gentry and Councilwomen Ann Christoph and Lida Lenney made up the council majority that rejected the temporary solution.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="44"> The consensus was that without the environmental report, there was not enough information to determine what the effect on the shore would be.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="45"> "My concern is that the council has never certified that there's a need for an ocean-protection device," Christoph said, "and the EIR is supposed to be documenting what those needs are.</s>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="46"> We would be prejudging the EIR, in a sense".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="47"> She recommended instead that an emergency preparedness plan be developed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="48"> But Councilwoman Martha Collison, who voted in support of the residents, said that when such an emergency occurs, it will be too late to protect the bluffs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="49"> And so the residents have given up, for now.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121490-0119" num="50"> With the six homeowners having spent about $150,000 on consultant fees during the last three years, McNaughton said their only hope now is that the city lets them know before the next winter season whether they can build a permanent structure to protect the shore and their homes.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="12"> Lifeguards say the past week's persistent record-breaking heat has boosted sea temperatures off the county coast into the middle and high 70s, in some places more than 10 degrees above normal.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="13"> Oceanographers and meteorologists said the warm currents may be coming from off the Baja California coast, where there is hot, humid tropical weather associated with a hurricane and a tropical storm.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="14"> The enticingly warm waters are a treat for those fortunate enough to escape to the beaches, but they bring extra work for lifeguards, who must be even more vigilant in monitoring the big crowds.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="17"> Clinton Winant, director of the Center for Coastal Studies at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, said temperatures normally hover around 68 degrees at the water's surface this time of year, and they slide to about 60 degrees at depths of about 15 feet.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="18"> That is what made Winant term "amazing" the last couple of days' readings of 73 to 76 off the Newport Beach pier at a depth of about 15 feet.</s>

<s docid="LA071790-0136" num="23"> Reed, a marine safety officer with Newport Beach's lifeguards, said the water temperatures remind him of the El Nino weather pattern that heated ocean waters in 1983, when the sea produced mercury readings of 70 to 75 degrees.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="7"> THE BOLIVIAN Eastern Farmers Chamber (CAO) has declared an indefinite hunger strike in protest at the lack of government aid in the wake of the agricultural disaster that has struck the Santa Cruz department as a result of months of flooding.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="8"> Peasant groups have announced other measures in support of the CAO - including road blocks - and a regional general strike may follow.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="9"> Santa Cruz in the east of the country, which produces 90 per cent of Bolivia's agricultural exports, principally soyabeans and sugar, has been devastated since January by the worst floods in living memory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="10"> At least a third and possibly as much as half the crop has been lost already and the sowing of the next crop has been seriously disrupted, the losses will continue for another harvest.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="11"> At least Dollars l00m has been lost to date, a vast sum for Bolivia.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="12"> As a result there will be a marked reduction in GNP growth this year according to economists.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="13"> Nearly a hundred farmers from the CAO have joined the hunger strike, including some of the wealthiest men in the country, and as many as 500 more are poised to follow.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="14"> In a remarkable development, the hardline right-wing farmers have literally become bedfellows with their traditional enemy, the Bolivian Workers' Central (COB), the national union confederation which still adheres, at least in theory, to a revolutionary Marxist ideology.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="15"> Some of COB leaders have joined the hunger strike and are now sleeping in the same room as the farmers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="16"> The farmers are calling for much more direct government and international assistance as well as rescheduling of loans from both private banks and multinational institutions, principally the Inter-American Development Bank.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="17"> They are demanding special help for the smaller farmers, worst hit financially because of their lack of access to credit, as a result of which thousands face bankruptcy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="18"> The CAO President, Mr Sergio Justiniano said: 'We will remain on hunger strike until a global solution is found'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="19"> The flooding is partly the result of exceptionally heavy rains that have accompanied the El Nino cyclical Pacific weather phenomenon, which has also brought flooding this year to Peru and Ecuador.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="20"> However, according to ecologists, the effect has been exacerbated in Bolivia by the extensive deforestation that has accompanied the agricultural boom of the past few years Despite officially declaring the region a disaster zone, the government claims that it is unable to help.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="21"> Mr Hugo Lozino, minister of peasant development said: 'We have done what we can.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="22"> Bolivia is a poor country and can't afford to do more'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-643" num="23"> It seems unlikely, however, that the government will be able to resist the powerful alliance confronting it, especially as it faces unrest in other key sectors, including mining.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="6"> THE PERUVIAN fishmeal industry is gearing up for a bonanza predicted to last for the next two to three years.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="7"> By late 1992, the sardine and anchovy that form the staple raw material for the industry were back in abundance after being temporarily affected by the appearance of the dreaded warm current known as 'El Nino', which last ravaged fishmeal output in 1983.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="8"> Contrary to predictions, however, Peruvian production survived last year's milder visitation and a late boost in fish stocks turned 1992 into yet another record year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="9"> Peru topped the world exporters' league with 1.37m tonnes, narrowly outstripping Chile's 1.21m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="10"> 'Statistically, the years after a Nino are excellent,' says Mr Espino of Imarpe, Peru's maritime institute, which is charged with husbanding the resource and recommending periodic fishing bans.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="11"> Mr Espino estimates that the Peruvian catch could be raised by a quarter or a third from the present 6m tonnes a year without detriment to the species.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="12"> 'And if the fishmeal producers started going for jack mackerel - at present only about 80,000 tonnes a year are landed, perhaps 5 per cent of total stocks - then the sky's the limit,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="13"> The main limitation on such expansion is fleet capacity.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="14"> Most Peruvian fishing boats are small, with no refrigeration and hug the coast.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="15"> When El Nino hits, the fish move into deeper waters farther out to sea where these boats cannot follow.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="16"> Peruvian producers say they have invested more than Dollars 200m in the past two years in fleet renovation and plant and equipment modernisation ashore.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="17"> The industry is moving towards production of higher-quality, low temperature, steam-dried meal with 'stickwater' plants to maximise protein recovery.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="18"> New boats with refrigerated holds are under construction in local yards.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="19"> But there's still plenty of room, and a warm welcome waiting, for new investment from abroad.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="20"> Representatives from Chile's huge Angelini group have been in Peru recently on 'feeling-out' visits.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="21"> And Venezuelan capital has already entered in the form of a new fishmeal joint venture under the name of Palangrera Peruana.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="22"> But the big surprise of 1993 could be the arrival of the Chinese.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="23"> Pesca Peru, the state-owned fishmeal and fishoil giant that produces around 40 per cent of all national output, is high on this year's privatisation list.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="24"> Coopers and Lybrand, with financing from the Canadian development agency and the World Bank, is currently completing a valuation and will recommend on sale procedures.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="25"> Essentially, the choice is between splitting the company into its 20 plants and four refineries to sell off individually; or selling the whole company as one unit.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="26"> The only likely buyers on the latter basis would be the Chinese - 'and it's a possibility that has the private producers in a state of panic', says Mr Eric Topf, head of the Pesca Peru privatisation committee.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="27"> Unofficially, senior Pesca Peru officials say the company should fetch 'at least Dollars 200m', a ball-park figure considered over-optimistic by private producers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="28"> The state-owned plants are, by and large, elderly and outdated - though several are excellently located on the now-desirable extreme southern coast and have their own quays.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="29"> Drastic personnel reductions during 1992 put Pesca Peru back into profit after years in the red, underlining just how profitable producing fishmeal can be, even from scrap-yard plants.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="30"> China has established itself as far and away Peru's largest customer, buying last year almost 60 per cent of all output.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="31"> Peruvian fishmeal goes to feed the Pacific prawn, turbot and eel which China is successfully exporting in quantity to the US and Japan.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="32"> The Chinese are said to be producing at present some 32m tonnes of animal foodstuffs a year, in which they use 2 per cent fishmeal - a very low percentage compared with most competitors.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="33"> A high-level Peruvian delegation is now in China 'to try to convince them of the bounties of boosting that fishmeal component,' says Mr Salomon Manzur, Peruvian president of the Fishmeal Exporters' Association.</s>

<s docid="FT932-14766" num="34"> If the Chinese do increase the percentage of fishmeal in their current animal feedstuff production, Peruvian producers will be assured of sales for their expanded fishmeal output for several years to come.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="6"> FEARS OF a tighter sugar supply/demand balance in 1992-93 are supporting the world market, according to reports from two London trade houses.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="7"> Raw sugar prices have recently touched eight-month highs, nudging 10 cents a lb in the New York market, on fears of tight nearby supplies following damage to the South African crop because of drought.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="8"> The trade houses, ED & F.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="9"> Man and Czarnikow, both point out in reports published today that in the short term the changing export potential in several countries will keep the lid on prices.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="10"> The increasing likelihood of a 1m-tonne increase in Thailand's crop, compared with the previous season, together with the availability of exportable surpluses from India and Cuba, should 'keep significant advances at bay', Man's latest sugar report says.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="11"> Man believes that reports of a catastrophic Cuban crop this season at 5m to 5.5m tonnes are unsupported by the evidence and estimates that the crop will come in at about 6.5m tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="12"> It is forecasting a crop of more than 5m tonnes in Thailand and 12.6m tonnes in India.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="13"> The overall balance for the 1991-92 season remains marginally in surplus, Man says, but it suggests that the situation is likely to be even more tightly balanced in 1992-93.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="14"> Czarnikow's sugar review points out that the extent of the South African drought has raised questions about the timing and coverage of the El Nino weather phenomenon.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="15"> 'Already a major drought is developing in Thailand which, if relief does not arrive this month, could have serious implications for the next crop,' the Czarnikow review says.</s>

<s docid="FT922-12623" num="16"> 'If this is part of a regional phenomenon there might be problems later in the year with the monsoon in India and this will need to be monitored carefully.'</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="12"> With fishing industry support, Assemblyman Gerald N.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="13"> Felando (R-San Pedro) is seeking passage of legislation to exempt commercial deep-sea and charter fishing operations from the sales and use tax for diesel fuel.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="14"> Twice in the past six years, the Legislature has approved temporary diesel fuel tax breaks for the state's commercial fishing vessels.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="15"> The most recent tax break lapsed on Jan. 1, 1989, but Felando now is pushing for a permanent exemption.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="16"> "We're just trying to save an industry," said Felando, 55, who as a youth worked aboard his father's fishing boat.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="17"> "Every little bit helps".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="18"> Fishermen also say they should be treated the same as farmers, who since the 1930s have enjoyed a similar diesel tax exemption for farm vehicles.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="19"> Felando's bill is opposed by the state Department of Finance, which says the measure singles out one business class for special treatment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="20"> Lenny Goldberg, lobbyist for the California Tax Reform Assn., a public interest tax group, has criticized the proposal as "the tax exemption that won't die".</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="21"> Goldberg complained that there has never been a determination of who benefits from the tax break.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="22"> "There are no hard numbers that it makes a difference".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="23"> But fisherman John Vilicich estimated that when the exemption was in place he saved from $7,000 to $14,000 a year on diesel fuel for a large tuna boat.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="24"> He said owners of smaller boats could save several thousand dollars a year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="25"> "Regardless of whether you catch the fish or not, you still burn fuel," Vilicich said.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="26"> The San Pedro fisherman said he used the savings for boat maintenance.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="27"> Officials of several commercial fishing groups said they have been persistent about reviving the legislation because their members are facing economic rough seas.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="28"> The fishermen complain they are plagued by increasing foreign competition, rising costs and dwindling numbers of fish.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="29"> Fishermen trace their troubles to 1984, when they experienced serious drops in income because of El Nino, a warm ocean current that disrupted worldwide weather patterns.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="30"> Mindful of those adverse conditions, the Legislature approved a two-year diesel fuel tax exemption.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="31"> But in 1986, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed an extension of the exemption, saying: "Other industries experiencing similar hardships are not afforded similar tax exemptions".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="32"> Later, the industry persuaded the governor to sign a one-year exemption for 1988.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="33"> It was designed to cushion commercial fishing boat operators from economic disruptions caused by the closure of canneries, increased insurance costs and rising ship-repair costs, according to an Assembly analysis of the latest Felando proposal.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="34"> Two other efforts to revive the exemption died in the Legislature.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="35"> The latest legislative initiative -- the Felando bill -- is pending in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="36"> Supporters say Felando's bill should be enacted, in part, because boat operators continue to face tough times.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="37"> Looking back to 1980, 800 million pounds of fish, valued at $316 million, were brought into California's ports, according to the state Department of Fish and Game.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="38"> In 1985, with fishermen feeling the brunt of El Nino, the figures dropped to 357 million pounds caught off California, valued at almost $127 million.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="39"> But, by 1988 -- the latest year for which figures are available -- the picture brightened with 496 million pounds of fish worth $201 million coming into the ports.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="40"> Still, the amount was below the 1980 level.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="41"> Tom Crehan, general manager of the San Pedro-based Fishermen's Cooperative Assn., said low catches are continuing, describing April as a poor month for his members.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="42"> In the past five years, he said, the membership of his fish marketing cooperative has dropped by a third -- from 24 to 16.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="43"> But even without the bad times for the fishing industry, the tax exemption should be reinstated, say other supporters of the bill.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="44"> They note that farm equipment and off-road logging trucks that use diesel fuel are already exempted from the sales tax.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="45"> Crehan argued that marine fishermen should get the same break as farmers "because both of them are producing food".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="46"> Robert Fletcher, president of the San Diego-based Sportfishing Assn. of California, voiced a similar argument, saying that fishing enthusiasts aboard his group's party boats are fishing for food.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="47"> "We believe that most of our passengers are from lower-income levels and supplement their protein by eating fish," Fletcher said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="48"> The opponents, however, regard the legislation as unfair.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="49"> If the fishing industry requires help, said Goldberg of the Tax Reform Assn., the state should target the economic aid to those fishing boat owners who need it the most.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="50"> Goldberg added that the state has failed to study the impact of previous exemptions.</s>

<s docid="LA050690-0183" num="51"> "It's unclear whether (they have) made much difference," he said.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="6"> Just as the collapse last August in De Beers' share price was an important factor in driving down the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, so its recent recovery has helped get the market off to a buoyant start in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="7"> The overall index has risen by about 4 per cent in the first three weeks, having closed 1992 down 5.3 per cent on the year.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="8"> The index closed yesterday up 22 at 3,404.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="9"> Much of this year's rise can be attributed to De Beers, which accounts for some 10 per cent of total volume and 5 per cent of market capitalisation.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="10"> The shares have risen by 16 per cent since the start of the year, closing yesterday at R68.25, after finishing 1992 at R57.50.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="11"> This improvement is mainly attributable to better than expected rough diamond sales by the Central Selling Organisation during 1992, and indications that the problem of excess supply from Angola and Russia has eased.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="12"> The industrial index has also started the year strongly, up 4 per cent, after a 4.6 per cent gain in the whole of 1992, which followed a strong 39 per cent rise the previous year.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="13"> Mr Richard Jesse, an analyst at brokers Martin & Co partly attributes this good start to the, by now, 'tedious litany' of the market's scrip shortage.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="14"> Nevertheless, most observers believe that 1993 will be a better year on the JSE than 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="15"> To some extent, this view is supported by improved political and economic fundamentals.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="16"> While the speed of political negotiation is rather slow all those involved are aware that the country cannot afford a repeat of the damaging political hiatus which followed the failure of the Codesa 2 talks in May and the Boipatong massacre in June.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="17"> Economic expectations, however, are muted: the weather pattern in recent weeks has led to renewed fears that the El Nino phenomenon, associated with the severe drought of 1991-92, has reappeared.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="18"> Last year, for instance, the drought shaved nearly 2 percentage points off GDP growth.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="19"> The expectation remains, however, of positive growth in 1993 of around 1.5 per cent (GDP shrunk by about 2 per cent in 1992), on hopes of a better agricultural season and improved commodity exports as world growth improves.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="20"> The earnings prospects of industrial companies remains gloomy.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="21"> Most companies that have reported recently have predicted a drop in profits and there is little expectation of improved corporate profits before 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="22"> In spite of these rather pale fundamentals, Mr Jesse is predicting a rerating of the market.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="23"> He believes that the Financial and Industrial index, currently on a price/earnings ratio of 14.9 times, down from a peak of some 15.5 in 1992, could rise to more than 16 this year.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="24"> He gives two main reasons for this forecast, apart from the improved political prospects.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="25"> First, the absence of alternatives: property returns are expected to fall in 1993, while money market rates which are in line with inflation, and likely to fall with interest rates, are hardly attractive.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="26"> Capital markets are also a difficult route because, while the probable short-term decline in inflation, which currently stands at about 11 per cent, is positive, this is counterbalanced by concerns about the size of the government's budget deficit and prospects of a relaxation in fiscal policy under an interim government.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="27"> Second, Mr Jesse argues that South African fund managers will be increasing the equity portion of their portfolios: many of them are underweight, holding less than 60 per cent in equities when the limit is as much as 75 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="28"> One unfashionable area which could receive some of these institutional funds is gold shares which have been sharply downrated over the past three years as the gold index declined from a peak of 2,250 to current levels of about 800, with a 30 per cent fall in 1992 alone.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="29"> Mr Mike Wuth, mining analyst at brokers Rice Rinaldi says that this correction has largely removed the speculative angle from gold.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="30"> Now, he says, gold has to offer decent returns and compete more directly with industrial shares.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="31"> However few analysts hold out much hope for a higher gold price in the short term and a weakening rand is only likely to offer limited benefit.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="32"> But one way that profits can be improved is through further cost cutting measures and the December gold quarterly results of mining houses confirm the impressive progress that has been made in this direction.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="33"> With the dividend yield of the gold index having risen to 6.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent three years ago, gold shares are now offering better value than for a number of years.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="34"> Mr Wuth forecasts that foreigners are more likely to be buyers of good shares than local institutions.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="35"> Many of the latter, he argues, are historically overweight in gold and so are looking for opportunities to lighten their holdings.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="36"> Overseas institutions, of course, will be wary of the vagaries of the financial rand investment unit, which started 1992 at a discount of 14 per cent to the commercial rand and ended at a discount of 37 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT931-13401" num="37"> But the political outlook and recent steps taken to bolster the currency, make any further weakening from current levels unlikely.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="24"> "OK, send it down," Mario Coppola says, instructing one already intrigued fisherman aboard one of Coppola's fleet of panga boats.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="25"> The fisherman has brought along a conventional rig, a rod and reel.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="26"> Guide Marcello Geraldo has baited the angler's iron jig with a strip of freshly cut squid and tosses it over the rail.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="32"> Too much pressure and the hook tears from the squid's clammy flesh.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="33"> The fidgety animal often spits the hook but, reluctant to let go of its meal, it waits to be brought to the surface, then spits the presentation back at the presenter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="34"> Several are lost before the game is figured out: It takes a steady yet slow pressure, like that used by the commercial hand-line fishermen, to bring a squid to the surface.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="35"> The appearance of jumbo squid in the gulf represents another way for the local commercial fishing fleet to make money, one that entails little work and brings fair return.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="36"> And in most seasons, one that should have ended months ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="37"> "They should be in Costa Rica right now," says Coppola, 40, whose family-owned Los Arcos Hotel in town is headquarters for his fleet of pangas.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="38"> "They just haven't left.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="39"> We had the same phenomena about eight years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="40"> They were almost all the way up to San Felipe".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="41"> The squid remained in the gulf for three years, even though the Mexican government contracted the services of a Korean fishing vessel, which used its bright lights to attract them to the surface and its sophisticated gear to pull them out by the thousands.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="42"> "We were eating squid in this town like jerky," Coppola recalls with a smile.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="43"> Dr. Eric Hochberg, curator of the Department of Invertebrates at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, remembered the phenomenon Coppola spoke of and said that the squid may be here to stay, for a while anyway.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="44"> "We don't know quite what's going on there," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="45"> "We think there probably got to be some oceanographic conditions that are setting the population up in that area, because normally that (type of) squid is found down off the coast of South America".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="46"> Hochberg said the squid made it as far north as Southern California during El Nino, the warm-water condition several years ago, adding, "It's probably something associated with that phenomenon that brings them into the (Sea of Cortez) and they're able to grow and probably reproduce in that area for a few years until the conditions change or the population dies down".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="47"> In any case, the presence of squid represents a change of pace for the recreational fisherman, a chance of doing battle with a legendary creature that at one time was labeled a sea monster.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="48"> At times during the late summer and fall the squid were so thick that calamari steaks were replacing the fish fillets on the seaside cutting boards.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="49"> Apparently, they still inhabit a wide section of the Sea of Cortez.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="50"> "We're still catching them," says Richard Castanada of the Hotel SPA Buenavista, a resort 65 miles south of La Paz.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="51"> "I've heard of instances where guys were trolling marlin lures and those things would come up and strike the marlin lures.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="52"> It's awesome.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="53"> "Some of these guys are just having a ball, yo-yoing jigs up and down and just getting nailed, because they put up a hell of a fight".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="54"> But most agree that the novelty of catching squid is generally a short-lived one among the more serious fishermen.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="55"> Marlin fishermen consider them pests because billfish gorge themselves on squid and become reluctant to eat anything else.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="56"> Others would rather fish with light tackle for the acrobatic dorado, or use the heavy stuff for the razor-toothed and powerful wahoo.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="57"> The three islands outside La Paz -- Espiritu de Santo, Partida and Cerralvo -- are home to a wide variety of near-shore game fish and rockfish, including one of Coppola's favorites, the pargo.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="58"> "A very, very good fighter," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="59"> "They're monstrous, very strong".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="60"> That became apparent when a trolled Rapala lure along the rocky coast of Cerralvo produced a three-pound sierra mackerel, which generated an uncharacteristic burst of speed after apparently tiring during its struggle.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="61"> A giant pargo chased it to the surface and lunged at it so fiercely that a huge swirling splash broke what had been a soothing silence and sent an aftershock of a wake that nearly rocked the small boat 30 yards away.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="62"> The pargo missed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="63"> "One hell of a different ballgame," said Coppola, whose hotel display boards are littered with photographs of arm-weary customers holding up these red and ash-red snappers.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="64"> Many weighed more than 60 pounds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="65"> The lure was thrown back over and within minutes a six-pound roosterfish was landed.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="66"> Moments later, Coppola brought over the rail a small cabrilla.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="67"> Sportfishermen discovered this city's game fish possibilities in the 1950s and La Paz quickly became known as one of the world's great billfish resorts.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="68"> The influx of tourists was assured for the capital of Baja California Sur.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="69"> But in recent years the government has focused most of its attention -- and budget -- on Cabo San Lucas as a means of attracting the fisherman-tourist.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="70"> The resort is where the famous weather-carved arches signify land's end.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="71"> Many of the locals are at their wits' end as to how the city can keep up with the demands of such development.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="75"> "I feel sorry for them," Coppola says.</s>

<s docid="LA022190-0109" num="76"> "La Paz is developing by itself, so from my way of looking at things, it's a cleaner development, not as rushed like in Cabo, in that they ruin things and they don't plan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="48"> Momo-1 carries three kinds of equipment to observe the following: --Distribution of plants, situation of land utilization, geological features, distribution of snow on land, disaster prevention, etc. --Water temperature on sea surface, conditions of ocean currents, red tide, conditions of water contamination, etc. --Volumeof vapor in atmosphere, ice floes, snow on ground, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="49"> In addition, Momo-1 has a function to collect data from buoys floating on the ocean and a basic experiment was also carried out using this system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="50"> After completing its initially scheduled two-year service with no malfunction, Momo-1 is still in operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="51"> The satellite Momo-1b, as a successor to the Momo-1, is continuing to observe the ocean, in particular, and the whole Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="52"> The most recent in the series is the earth resources satellite Fuyo-1, which was launched last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="53"> Fuyo-1 was developed in order to evolve observation equipment, including a high-performance radar, to confirm the functions of the equipment and establish a comprehensive system for earth resources observation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="54"> Fuyo-1's main purpose is to probe resources, but the satellite also serves to survey national land and observe the conditions of agriculture, forestry and fisheries and environmental preservation, to prevent disasters and to keep a watch on coastal waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="55"> The observation equipment on board the Momo-1 is capable of checking the undulations and inclinations of land surfaces even under rainy conditions and at night.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="56"> It is also able to observe land shapes in three dimensions and distinguish rocks, minerals, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="57"> Japan's earth observation technology is thus shifting from an experimental stage to a stage of new development, in which the technology is widely recognized as effective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="58"> It will soon become important for Japan to show what she can offer to international society.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="59"> Future Plans</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="60"> Under development now are the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="61"> ADEOS is designed to succeed the marine observation satellite and the earth resources satellite to continue collection of data in earth observation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="62"> The development of ADEOS is also aimed at developing new technology that will be required in order to develop future earth observation satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="63"> A total of eight kinds of observation equipment, of which two will be supplied by the National Space Development Agency and six will be selected from among those offered generally, will be mounted on ADEOS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="64"> The function of this equipment is to observe the marine climate, the ozone layer, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="65"> The following are the missions for NASDA's two observation apparatuses: --Frequent acquisition of data on water color and water temperature of oceans and detection of chlorophyll density, floating materials and dissolved substances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="66"> (These missions will give data on the volume of substances produced by marine activities, the mechanism of the circulation of carbon dioxide gas and conditions for fishing operations).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="67"> --Observation of land and coastal waters and surveys of the destruction of tropical forests, desertification and water contamination.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="68"> The equipment will also be able to serve in surveys of land use and to probe resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="69"> TRMM will make observations on global-scale climatic changes, such as the El Nino phenomenon and desertification.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="70"> To solve the mystery of climatic changes, it is necessary to make comprehensive observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land over a long period of time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="71"> It is particularly important to observe the circulation of water and energy (heat).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="72"> For this reason TRMM will observe rainfall and radiation of heat from the ground surface.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="73"> These observations should be conducted on a global scale, but special emphasis will be placed on the tropical regions, because two-thirds of the rainfall on the earth occurs there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="74"> The TRMM project is being jointly promoted by Japan and the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="75"> On this side, NASDA of Japan is to launch the satellite with an H-II rocket and to develop radar apparatus for rainfall observation, while NASA in the United States is to develop the main body of the satellite and the remaining observation equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="76"> The United States is also in charge of operating TRMM after its launch, using a data relay satellite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="77"> Two further satellites, ADEOS-II and High Resolution Observation Satellite, HIROS are under development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="78"> They will be launched to succeed the above satellites in operation and continue to collect data and to improve observation functions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="79"> ADEOS-II will be launched in 1999 mainly to conduct global-scale earth observation as a successor to ADEOS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="80"> HIROS will be utilized for map drawing and disaster prevention, as it is capable of gathering detailed information.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="81"> Its launch is scheduled for the year 2000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="82"> Postscript</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="83"> The technology for earth observation is thus about to enter a mature stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="84"> The important issue from now will be how to make use of it, using the given means.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="85"> The following are some of the expected applications: (i) Use of satellites for weather forecasting and other activities which directly affects peoples' daily lives (ii) To serve in national land development, covering agriculture, fisheries, urban development, etc., and to probe resources (iii) To watch for disasters and enable effective countermeasures (iv) To understand what is happening on the Earth and to enrich man's fund of useful knowledge (v) To balance the development and preservation of environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="86"> To use satellites to find the most effective method to solve earth environmental problems, by warning the need to curb human activities, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="87"> It is important today to widen the fields in which satellite data are effectively used and to expand the data utilization volume.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="88"> It is necessary to gain a solid recognition of Japan's earth observation efforts from not only Japanese people, but also from the peoples of the world.</s>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="9"> A coastal barrier that has kept rare birds from reproducing at Batiquitos Lagoon in Carlsbad soon will be removed, the state Department of Fish and Game announced Tuesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="10"> The El Nino storms of the early 1980s created a large cobble blockage at the mouth of the lagoon that trapped water over areas where the California least tern and the Belding's savannah sparrow traditionally nest.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="11"> The least tern is on federal and state endangered species lists, and the Belding sparrow is on the state list.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="12"> Fish and Game wildlife biologist Theresa Stewart said Tuesday that crews will close South Carlsbad State Beach part of next week while removing the cobble barrier that is 15 feet high, 30 feet long and 18 feet wide.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="13"> "There's a dam out there, basically," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="14"> Carlsbad's assistant planning director, Gary Wayne, added, "The lagoon just keeps filling".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="15"> Over the years, the flooding of sensitive habitat has discouraged the rare species from nesting.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="16"> Stewart said 47 pairs of Belding's savannah sparrows were reported at the lagoon in 1986, but that number has since dropped to fewer than 20 pairs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="17"> "The population is declining, I don't think we'll get back up to 47," Stewart said.</s>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="18"> "If we get 30, I'll be happy".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="19"> As for the least terns, last year only three pairs tried to nest, and Stewart figures, "if the water level is lower, we could expect 20 to 30 pairs".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="20"> Although the numbers seem insignificant, Stewart pointed out there are only an estimated 1,200 pairs of least terns in California.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="21"> El Nino storms produced the barrier as the rough surf washed away the beach sand and left cobbles protruding 12 feet above sea level, enough to keep water from flowing out of the lagoon and opening the nesting areas.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="22"> It is critical to remove the cobbles now because the nesting season for the least tern begins in May, Stewart said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041890-0004" num="23"> She also believes that lowering the lagoon's water level would benefit other species, including the snowy plover, the American avocet, black-necked stilt and Forster's tern.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="10"> Washington state officials have spent five years and hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to keep the flippered freeloaders from decimating a prized run of wild steelhead trout in a shipping channel between Puget Sound and Lake Washington.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="11"> Rock music, killer whale recordings, tainted fish and 6,000 rounds of M-80 firecrackers so far have failed to discourage the 40 to 60 sea lions who consider the man-made fish ladder at Ballard Locks their private smorgasbord.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="12"> "We're at the bottom of our bag of tricks relative to non-lethal measures," admitted Joe Scordino, deputy director of the northwest regional offices of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction over the animals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="13"> This year, Washington is hoping to get $170,000 in federal funding to capture the sea lions and truck them home to the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara, but California is balking at the plan, even suggesting at one point that shooting the sea lions would be a preferable solution.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="14"> Washington fish and wildlife officials are now combing the National Marine Mammals Protection Act for legal loopholes that would allow them to do just that as a last resort -- a precedent that could dramatically alter interpretation of the 1972 law.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="15"> The fight over the fate of the creatures Seattle fans generically nicknamed "Herschel" is considered unique because it makes man both the instigator and the mediator in a conflict between two wild species.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="17"> "The greatest value of that run is as an environmental barometer," said Bob Byrne, spokesman for the Washington Department of Wildlife, which oversees the steelhead.</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="33"> One theory for the sea lions' sudden appearance at Ballard Locks is that they began following large schools of fish moving northward with the warming waters of El Nino several years ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="34"> Because the locks mark the convergence of fresh and salt water, the fish mill downstream while undergoing physiological changes for their freshwater migration over the man-made "ladder" of ascending pools which will take them around the dam to their spawning streams.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="35"> "The fish are sort of in a trance," explained Rust, the spokeswoman for Greenpeace, which advocates a physical barrier such as old tires to give the fish cover on their way to the ladder.</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="43"> Although most of the sea lions hunt at the mouth of the locks, about a dozen swim right past the ships to take up position at the entrance to the fish ladder, where the confused fish wait for the water flow to pull them into the system of pools.</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="74"> While they agree that 60 sea lions would not make much difference in a year-round population of some 80,000, California officials and fishermen worry that relocation could open the door for turning the state into a dumping ground for problem animals.</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="75"> Pete Bontadelli, director of the California Department of Fish and Game, told Washington officials in a letter last July that the department opposed shifting the problem "from one area to another".</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="80"> "We believe they should deal with a Washington problem in Washington," said Hal Cribbs, executive secretary for the commission.</s>

<s docid="LA012990-0054" num="82"> But whether California has any real say in the matter may also be a matter for courts to decide, since the final decision now rests with the National Marine Fisheries Service, a federal body.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="7"> POWER cuts of at least eight hours a day have been imposed all over Colombia in an effort to cope with a drought that has reduced the water for hydro electric plants.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="8"> There is little prospect of rain, and reservoirs are drying into baked mud.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="9"> If this continues the country could face a complete black-out by the end of April.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="10"> The winter rains are late and the El Nino current off the Pacific coast appears to be upsetting normal weather patterns.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="11"> But bad planning, heavy debts, corruption, budget deficits, deforestation and poor management are behind the electricity problems.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="12"> Colombia's generating capacity is 8,200MW, more than adequate for normal demand levels.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="13"> Despite the country's ample coal and oil reserves, 78 per cent of power comes from large, expensive hydro-electric schemes which have pushed the sector's foreign debt up to more than Dollars 5bn.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="14"> To try to save on costs, electricity companies have been running down the reservoirs rather than use thermal plants at full capacity.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="15"> Labour and financial problems have also delayed the maintenance of thermal power stations, while guerrilla attacks have put distribution lines out of action.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="16"> The rationing aims to cut overall consumption by about a third.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14235" num="17"> The government has asked industry to shut down for 10 days over Easter and to send workers on holiday.</s>
