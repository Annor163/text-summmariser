<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="9"> The Assembly on Monday approved a bill aimed at cracking down on the latest proliferation of garment industry sweatshops in Orange and Los Angeles counties by making designer-name garment houses responsible for child labor and overtime abuses committed by their independent suppliers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="10"> The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), was introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times revealed that many independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as little as $1.45 an hour to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians relocating to such Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Westminster.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="11"> Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who represents those areas, joined his Republican colleagues in voting against the bill on Monday, but a Democratic majority gave Hayden's measure the 44-30 margin needed to pass the lower house and be sent to the Senate for consideration.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="12"> Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held "jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="13"> Depending on the complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece rate often translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an hour.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="14"> In the past, these independent jobbers have avoided paying fines by simply folding their operations when caught and cited by state labor officials, leaving many of the exploited workers stranded even without their minimum wages.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="15"> But Hayden's bill would change that by placing the burden of the fines and back pay on the manufacturers, who hired the independent jobbers in the first place.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="16"> Hayden and supporters of the bill -- the California Labor Federation and the International Ladies' Garments Workers' Union -- say the change is necessary because of widespread labor abuses.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="17"> "This is an industry where there's a lot of documented lawlessness -- child-labor violations, unsafe working conditions, fire hazards, people not getting paid what they deserve," Hayden said.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="18"> "And it's the very structure of the industry that's out of control.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="19"> "This (the bill) is to make the manufacturer liable for the rampant lawlessness instead of what they now do, which is reap the benefit but take none of the burden," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="20"> Hayden added that his bill was intended to close a "gaping hole" in the garment-manufacturing registration law of 1980, which was enacted after reports of widespread labor abuses in the industry.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="21"> The bill received support from Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), whose district encompasses the downtown Los Angeles garment district.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="22"> "On any given day, you can go to any one of these buildings and see the most deplorable working conditions imaginable," she said, adding that some shops have structural problems, blocked exits and piles of flammable materials.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="23"> But Pringle, who said he was equally opposed to the labor abuses, maintained that the Hayden bill would place an inappropriate burden on the manufacturers, who cannot be assumed to know about the alleged infractions of their subcontractors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="24"> "This is not where the person who makes the contract specifically knows that the independent contractor is breaking the laws," he argued.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="25"> "If somebody is doing something wrong, they should be punished for it and not everybody up and down the line," Pringle added.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="26"> Other Orange County legislators voting against Hayden's bill were Doris Allen (R-Cypress); Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos); Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach); Robert C.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="27"> Frazee (R-Carlsbad); Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach); Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) and John R. Lewis (R-Orange).</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="28"> NEXT STEP</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="29"> Hayden's bill now goes to the Senate, where it will be examined by a committee and then the full upper house.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="30"> If the bill is amended, it will be sent back to the Assembly for agreement before being forwarded to Gov. George Deukmejian, who can either veto it or sign the measure into law.</s>

<s docid="LA061290-0137" num="31"> 'We're going to have to work to get the governor's attention on this, to show it is good for responsible businesses and the sort of thing that is overdue,' Hayden has said.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="14"> Beside them toil Latino immigrants who have fled impoverished homelands for prosperous Southern California, only to land Third World-style jobs here.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="15"> At least 400 sewing shops have sprung up in and around Orange County's Little Saigon, employing upward of 5,000 immigrants.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="16"> In fact, the majority of the shop owners are themselves former boat people who have been in this country less than five years.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="17"> These suburban sweatshops are tucked into clean new industrial buildings, just out of sight of their affluent neighbors, and out of mind of the consumers who buy their products in some of the nation's priciest department stores.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="18"> Seeing "Made in USA" labels, most shoppers are utterly unaware that some of these garments have been made by immigrants and refugees -- sometimes children -- working long hours for a fraction of the minimum wage.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="19"> It's not just money but a certain resignation to hardship that keeps these immigrants at their sewing machines.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="20"> Ngoc Pha Nguyen, 46, has worked at several sewing shops that cheated and underpaid her.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="21"> Now she earns $4.25 an hour, the California minimum wage.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="22"> She is deeply grateful.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="23"> It took Nguyen four attempts to escape from Vietnam.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="24"> Two of her daughters and 14 other family members didn't make it.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="25"> "I'm very sad, so when I get to work, I forget about it for a while," she said through an interpreter.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="26"> "If I stay home, I look at the family shrine and cry".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="27"> Nguyen bends over to stitch the flounces on party dresses -- a tedious task performed over and over under hot lights in a crowded, airless garage.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="28"> The truth is, she hates to sew.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="29"> But, she says, she can't find a better job.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="30"> The shop where Nguyen works is paid $6.75 for each dress she stitches.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="31"> Identical dresses with the same labels were selling at a South Coast Plaza department store for $64 each.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="32"> "The people who are really making the big money are the retailers and the financiers of the retailers, and some of the manufacturers," said Edna Bonacich, a UC Riverside sociology professor studying Asians in the California garment industry.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="33"> "The workers are totally exploited".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="34"> Once a backwater in the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles-area garment industry, Orange County now produces everything from junior knits to inexpensive evening wear.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="35"> But it is a transformation that comes with a price tag of its own.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="36"> Authorities warn that these new suburban sweatshop workers -- particularly in Orange County but also in immigrant strongholds throughout Southern California -- are becoming the latest victims of an industry that has been nourished by cheap immigrant labor for nearly a century.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="37"> Far from the downtown Los Angeles garment district, where enforcement officials know the turf, offenders are hard to catch.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="38"> And federal and state labor officials say that when they do find them, enforcement is often stymied by the same dynamics that have kept sweatshops in business for more than a century.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="39"> Owners insist they'll go bankrupt if they pay the minimum wage.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="40"> Workers won't complain no matter how bad their treatment because they are undocumented aliens, are receiving public assistance or are simply afraid.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="41"> And manufacturers have few incentives to investigate the conditions under which their products are made.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="42"> Suburban Sweatshops</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="43"> From the outside, Orange County sweatshops bear little resemblance to the ones found in dilapidated buildings in teeming garment districts in downtown Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="44"> Most are in brand-new complexes of light-industrial buildings that tend to be located just behind the restaurants and mini-malls that line the thoroughfares connecting Garden Grove, Westminster and Santa Ana, where about 100,000 Vietnamese-Americans have settled since 1975.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="45"> "Sweatshops flourish wherever you have pockets of immigrants," said Allen J. Scott, professor of urban and economic geography at UCLA.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="46"> "It's not just happening in Orange County, it's happening in the San Fernando Valley and in Long Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="47">. . . And there's a big new Korean community growing up around Van Nuys .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="48"> "What has been happening recently is a decentralization in all directions out from the garment district, not only to tap. . immigrant populations but also to take advantage of the cheaper land," Scott said .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="49"> In 1983, Scott studied garment subcontractors and found that nearly all were located in downtown Los Angeles.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="50"> He found only two in Orange County.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="51"> Last spring, Bonacich analyzed the ethnic makeup of the state's 4,589 registered garment contractors and found 172 in Orange County.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="52"> The owners of 102 of them were Vietnamese.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="53"> One was Chinese, 11 Latino and 10 Korean; 24 were owned by other Asians whose national origin was unclear, and the rest were unknown.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="54"> Including the 20% to 30% of shops that are unregistered and the scores of mini-sweatshops hidden inside single-family homes and garages, Bonacich estimates Orange County now has at least 400 sewing shops.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="55"> "We haven't run into a single Vietnamese who's been in business here for more than two years, so this seems like a brand-new business for Orange County," said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="56"> Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division in Santa Ana.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="57"> "In the last two years, it's just exploded".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="58"> But while wages and working conditions in Los Angeles have on the whole improved thanks to heavy enforcement, officials said, labor abuses in Orange County are widespread.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="59"> A recent crackdown spearheaded by Otero found 18 Orange County sweatshops that had been violating minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws -- including the shop that employed Ngoc Pha Nguyen, according to documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times under the Freedom of Information Act.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="60"> So far, the shops have been ordered to repay more than $180,000 to at least 220 workers, and some cases are still pending, Otero said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="61"> "The extremely low wages across the board in Orange County are not the case in Los Angeles," Otero said.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="62"> "In L.A. you will find $10-an-hour employees.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="63"> In Orange County, we have yet to find a single employee paid any more than the minimum wage".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="64"> The suburbanization of sweatshops is an outgrowth of the changes that are reshaping the garment industry, scholars and officials said.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="65"> First, foreign competition has driven down prices in the domestic sewing industry.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="66"> But at the same time, manufacturers need flexible production capability because rush orders for more of a hot-selling item cannot be filled fast enough overseas.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="67"> The solution -- especially in inexpensive clothing, women's and junior wear, where fashions change overnight and quality is often second to price and timing -- is to subcontract the sewing.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="68"> This enables manufacturers quickly to shift their designs and output to ride out the treacherous market tides -- while largely escaping legal responsibility for any labor abuses committed by the companies that sew for them, officials and garment-industry sources said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="69"> "They've created a Third World labor force here to match the Third World labor force with which they're competing abroad," Bonacich said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="70"> "We all need work, and we take anything we can get," said one Vietnamese shop owner, who said she cannot possibly pay her workers the minimum wage because the price she gets for finished garments is so low.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="71"> Labor Police</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="72"> Some argue that labor police have never succeeded in crushing sweatshops in the past and are unlikely to do so now because the market demands them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="73"> "If you really tried to enforce immigration and other laws about working conditions, in both the garment industry and the electronics industry in Southern California, the effect on the economy would be disastrous," Scott said.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="74"> "So the enforcement is symbolic more than it is systematic".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="75"> In a typical suburban sweatshop, fluorescent lights beat down on rows of sewing machines.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="76"> Heaps of pre-cut fabric spill out of plastic bags onto cement floors littered with scraps of cloth, threads and cigarette butts.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="77"> Remnants of meals linger in odd corners, and the air smells sour.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="78"> In many shops owned by Asians, the office decor includes a red-and-gold lacquered shrine with an incense holder and a porcelain statue of Than Tai, the Vietnamese god of money.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="79"> Perhaps no less symbolic are the time clocks and posters nearby that detail, in English, the California minimum wage and overtime laws.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="80"> They pacify the authorities, but few of the workers can read, write or speak English.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="81"> And the time cards are rarely used to determine wages, because most workers are paid by the piece.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="82"> Labor abuses exist in part because both shop owners and the workers themselves are participants in a vast underground economy.</s>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="83"> Authorities say the sweatshops prey on two particularly vulnerable groups: illegal Latino aliens and Southeast Asian refugees who work illegally and collect welfare at the same time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA112689-0137" num="84"> "My former boss used to pay us 10 cents a piece for ironing," said Maria del Pilar Solano, 23, a sweatshop worker who has since applied for immigration amnesty and is not receiving public assistance.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="7"> Most local education authorities are failing in their duty to police child labour, and their regulatory responsibilities should be transferred to environmental health departments, a report says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="8"> The report, delivered at a conference of the International Association of Labour Inspection in Tunisia, may embarrass the government among its European partners.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="9"> The government has met European Union resistance to its attempt to secure a four-year opt-out from a directive controlling the number of hours that children can work.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="10"> It believes the European law, which forbids children under 15 from working more than 12 hours a week, would interfere with newspaper rounds.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="11"> The survey by Ms Michele Baron, a senior environmental health officer attached to the Health and Safety Executive, sampled 15 per cent of local education authorities.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="12"> She found six out of 10 treated applications for children's work permits from employers as an administrative exercise and did nothing to enforce child labour laws by checking on working conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="13"> 'They have all made by-laws under the relative acts, but the extent to which they enforce them varies depending on the available resources,' said Ms Baron.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="14"> 'Local authority environmental health inspectors are in a better position to undertake this work.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="15"> 'They are regularly inspecting the places where children work and have more resources to devote to this area,' she said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="16"> The report emerges amid increasing concerns among British labour organisations about the extent of illegal child labour.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="17"> Last month five children were discovered working at a clothing factory in Preston, Lancashire.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="18"> Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, has estimated that more than 2m children do illegal part-time work in the UK and the Labour party produced figures recently which recorded 39 work-related deaths among 16-to-19-year-olds in the UK since 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="19"> Ms Baron's survey coincides with a study carried out by the Scottish Low Pay Unit which found widespread abuse of child-labour laws among three schools it surveyed in Dumfries and Galloway.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="20"> More than a third of the 259 pupils surveyed were working and the majority of them worked beyond the time limits laid down in law.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="21"> The children were working an average of 8.5 hours a week and drew average weekly earnings of Pounds 13.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="22"> One child was working a 39-hour week as well as attending school.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="23"> Fewer than a quarter of the pupils had possessed a work permit.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="24"> The report also found that children who had never worked were likely to have better results in English examinations, though mathematics results appeared unaffected.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="25"> Ms Baron said: 'Enforcing the laws properly and decreasing the amount of illegal child labour in the UK would increase the amount of work available for adults.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8040" num="26"> I am not advocating more regulations but more effective inspection techniques'.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="21"> They must also pay parents or guardians up to Rmb20,000 in compensation as well as Rmb400 for funeral expenses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="22"> While China's Foreign Ministry has denied the existence of child labour in the country, semi-official groups have admitted its emergence as economic opportunities draw children -- especially those from the countryside -- into factories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="23"> The vice-secretary of the China Youth Development Foundation, Xi Jieying, said in 1991 that child labour was "becoming serious", especially in Zhejiang and Fujian.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="24"> An estimated 4 million children between the ages of six and 19 (about 2.5 percent of the total) drop out of school every year in China, an ample pool for sweatshop factories to draw on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="25"> Labour analysts said the new laws in Zhejiang, which are substantially tougher than those in other parts of the country, reflect a general drive to solve labour problems in order to defuse criticism of rapid industrial growth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="26"> "The problem of child labour in China is surfacing now which gives more legitimacy to opponents of reforms," Pian Chua, of the Hong Kong-based labour rights group Asia Monitor, said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="27"> "The issue relates to internal stability as well as international criticism, so they have to deal with it," he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="28"> Chua said the passage of new laws would be an important step.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="29"> "It may take a while to eradicate the problem but it is an important deterrent for some violators and it gives local authorities more power to carry out inspections," he said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="30"> The State Council passed its first law banning child labour in April 1991.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="31"> Since then provinces have been allowed to pass specific sanctions and implementation measures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="32"> The issue of child labour in China first came to international attention at the end of 1991 when U.S. labour and consumer groups called for a boycott of toys made in China during the Christmas season over allegations of the use of child labour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="33"> Subsequent investigations by Hong Kong groups found only scattered evidence of child labour in toy factories but the problem was already well documented.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="34"> A survey of foreign-funded enterprises by Guangdong authorities in Shenzhen and Dongguan in 1988 found that 70 percent were illegally employing children.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50830" num="35"> A subsequent year-long campaign in the province uncovered 3,206 children employed illegally and authorities later cracked a group organising the trafficking of children from Guangxi to factories in the special economic zones of Guangdong.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="6"> THE parallel agreements that form part of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement mark the first time a trade treaty requires member countries to enforce their environmental and labour laws, and punishes them with fines or sanctions if they do not.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="7"> The side agreements, which were proposed by Mr Bill Clinton when he was a candidate for the US presidency, do not require countries to write new laws, but simply to enforce those they have.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="8"> They impose penalties on countries of up to Dollars 20m - and if they are not paid, sanctions can be imposed - that allow their companies to gain a competitive advantage by not complying with existing environmental and labour regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="9"> The agreements will formally apply to all three members of Nafta, (although Canada will not be liable for sanctions) but were negotiated to persuade wavering Democrats in the US Congress to support Nafta.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="10"> They had opposed the treaty partly on the grounds that Mexico would take jobs from the US by exploiting its labour, and providing a haven for polluting factories.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="11"> While going further than any previous trade treaty, the accords fall short of what most critics of Nafta wanted, and have failed to win over many converts to the treaty.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="12"> Critics complain that under the accords the process of imposing fines on member countries is long and cumbersome; that only governments, rather than pressure groups, are empowered to initiate investigations into lack of compliance; and that the powers of the labour commission are deficient.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="13"> Even supporters of the trade pact agree that the main intention of the side accords is to promote co-operation, rather than compel through sanctions the enforcement of all laws.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="14"> None of the three countries, including the US, was prepared to give up sovereignty that supra-national enforcement would have required.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="15"> The accords create a tri-national Environmental and a tri-national Labour Commission, both of which comprise a Council (made up of three ministers), and a professional secretariat of staff members, which is partly protected from interference from the national governments.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="16"> If a complaint has been made about non-enforcement of environment, the environmental council has to vote by majority to convene an arbitration panel of five independent members to decide if there has been a 'persistent pattern of failure' to enforce the relevant regulations.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="17"> The arbitration panel has to issue a final report and make recommendations within about eight months.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="18"> If the panel's recommendations are ignored, the panel can fine the offending nation, if the non-enforcement is trade-related.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="19"> If the fines are ignored for another six months, the complaining country can impose sanctions on the country (in the case of Mexico and the US) or take it to court (in the case of Canada).</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="20"> The process is even more long-winded for violations of specified labour rights.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="21"> For, while the original intention was to have symmetrical labour and environmental accords, the provisions on labour are weaker than those on environment.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="22"> The failure to enforce all environmental laws is subject to fines and sanctions, but with labour, penalties are limited only to failure to enforce minimum wages, safety standards, and child labour laws.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="23"> The North American Labour Commission is limited to a staff of 15, whereas there is no limit on the Environmental Comm-ission.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="24"> The environmental agree-ment allows all information to be used in findings, whereas the labour agreement only allows publicly available information from governments to be submitted.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="25"> The impact of the labour side accord could be significant, if Mexican enforcement was stepped up as a result.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="26"> While Mexico's minimum wage laws are in effect enforced by the market place, child labour is widespread in Mexico -according to the estimate of the 1990 census there were 418,575 workers between the ages of 12 and 14.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="27"> Likewise, factories, especially small ones, routinely ignore health and safety standards, and could probably not remain in business if they had to comply with all the existing laws.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="28"> Nevertheless, US unions have complained that the labour side accord fails to address violations of the right to strike and the right to choose independently a union - such violations, they say, keeps Mexican wages down to artificially low levels.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="29"> Mexico's minimum wage is about Dollars 4.20 a day, and the registered average wage Dollars 12.50 a day.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="30"> The Mexican government has wide powers to interpret labour law to its advantage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="31"> The government is closely allied with the official Confederation of Mexican Workers, headed by non-agenarian labour leader Fidel Velazquez, and the two have worked together to make sure no break-away union acquires too much power, and undoes the official wage and price policy.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="32"> Last year unions announced plans to strike 6,814 times, but only about 140 resulted in plant shutdowns.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="33"> In a not unusual example, a strike at Volkswagen car plant was declared illegal by the (government-controlled) Federal Labour Board, even though a majority of workers had voted in favour of the strike.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="34"> A labour leader in the border city of Matamoros that has urged workers to strike for higher wages, was arrested for not paying his taxes, and the strike called off.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="35"> Ironically, Mexican labour laws go much further than US laws in defending labour rights - guaranteeing the right to annual leave, profit sharing, three months maternity leave, generous severance payments and in disallowing factories from replacing striking workers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="36"> But the laws are so complex, that full compliance is difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="37"> By forcing Mexican companies to compete under free trade, Nafta may in fact lead the Mexican government to reform the labour law, and strip some of the legal protections offered to workers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="38"> Government officials and businessmen argue that the labour law over-regulates the labour market, and is an obstacle to productivity.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="39"> The environmental accord is tougher than the labour one, partly because environ-mentalists were closely involved in drawing up the drafts to the accord.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="40"> There was also a greater willingness on behalf of Mexico and Canada to make concess-ions in the environment, a politically and economically less sensitive area than the labour market.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="41"> The Mexican government has been stepping up its enforcement of environmental laws lately, but independent reports suggest there is much to be done.</s>

<s docid="FT934-9422" num="42"> A study released last year by the US General Accounting Office found that none of six in-bond plants that were questioned along the US-Mexican border had complied with the necessary Environmental Impact Statement before setting up their factories.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="10"> In February, 1920, with ratification of the 19th Amendment just months away, suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt founded the League of Women Voters of the United States.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="11"> Faced with a newly enfranchised group of 20 million women who had been told it was unladylike to vote, the national nonpartisan league dedicated itself to eradicating that notion and educating women about the issues and their new responsibilities.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="12"> Seventy years later, with membership and funds declining, the league is still working hard to get out the vote, influence government policy and promote participation in the political process.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="13"> But in an age of glitz, celebrity, short attention spans and sound-bite campaigning, the league is seldom in the limelight.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="14"> Its loyal members seem to see themselves, by choice, as a backstage organization out to preserve the democratic process.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="15"> They know the league has a visibility problem, that it has a reputation for doing drudge work, that it is described in rather unglamorous terms: solid, stalwart, dedicated, naive, boring.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="16"> Can such an organization expect to be around for its 80th birthday in the year 2000?</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="17"> This year, members of the Los Angeles League, which was also founded in 1920, will be celebrating and soul-searching.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="18"> There is an anniversary brunch this weekend, a fund-raiser in the fall and, shortly, a letter that league president Lois Saffian will be sending to past presidents, asking, "Where do we go from here"?</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="19"> "We're facing a challenge right now as a volunteer organization," Saffian said recently at the league's offices in the Mid-Wilshire area.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="39"> The diminishing resources that most concern Saffian are people -- the men and women who do the work (the league has admitted men since 1974).</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="45"> "As a result, they're being catered to by Republicans and Democrats," Glazer said of the league, which, for example, this year is backing ballot measures supporting a largely Republican-backed reapportionment initiative, bipartisan state and local ethics reform measures and a transportation ballot measure led by Gov.

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="55"> The organization is frequently described as a leadership training ground for future public life, and the Los Angeles league is proud of members like former City Council President Pat Russell and Councilwoman Joy Picus.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="64"> Since the 1950s the league has been at the forefront of many environmental issues.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="65"> League members worked for civil rights, especially through voter registration, and, in Los Angeles, supported school desegregation and busing.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="67"> But voting and governmental processes have been a primary focus, and last year the national league decided to scale down, declaring it could no longer be all things to all people.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="68"> Its priorities are public campaign financing and voter registration and turnout.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="69"> The league has worked for passage of the national voter registration act, commonly called the "motor voter" act, which includes provisions enabling people to register when they get their driver's licenses.</s>

<s docid="LA031690-0112" num="77"> That is a frequently heard description of the league and one that may become controversial in California in the coming months.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="6"> A weary US trade negotiator emerged this week from five hours of inconclusive talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="7"> He turned to waiting reporters and said: 'I have a quote for you: Canada stinks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="8"> Mexico stinks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="9"> Nafta stinks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="10"> I've cancelled my vacation three times because of these talks, and now, I'm out of here'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="11"> As talks in Washington have broken up for negotiators to snatch delayed summer holidays, the outburst says much about the frustration that has built up over months of glacial progress.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="12"> Three deadlines for completion of negotiations on side agreements to the main treaty, covering minimum labour and environmental standards, have come and gone in the past month.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="13"> Trade lobbyists in Washington find it hard to assesses whether the talks are close to completion, or close to collapse.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="14"> One spoke yesterday of 'wildly fluctuating assessments' circulating around Capitol Hill.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="15"> But as negotiators have whittled away at the handful of outstanding labour and environmental issues separating the US, Mexico and Canada, it seems all three countries have domestic political barriers which cast doubt on a successful outcome.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="16"> In the US, President Clinton is paralysed by an issue that divides the Democratic party down the middle.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="17"> With a bruising battle over the budget just behind him, he is bracing himself for the controversial passage of healthcare reform.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="18"> Many advisers are urging him not to waste political capital on Nafta, which they see as less pivotal.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="19"> Those in the party with either labour or environmental interests see Nafta as a threat to jobs or to efforts to enforce higher environmental standards.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="20"> Mr Clinton is under pressure to deliver a deal which 'has teeth', both in reversing environmental degradation in the maquiladoras (free-trade zones) along the US-Mexico border, and in preventing labour abuses in factories being relocated to Mexico.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="21"> For Mexico, the Nafta deal was intended to provide President Carlos Salinas with a springboard for a like-minded reformist president to win the election due in September next year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="22"> But after the long delays, officials stress the agreement is not indispensable to stability and growth.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="23"> Mrs Kim Campbell, Canada's new prime minister, faces federal elections within three months.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="24"> During the recession of the past four years, which has deeply dented the government's popularity, the US-Canada free-trade agreement agreed in 1989 has been blamed by Canadian voters for many ills.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="25"> They think Nafta will make matters worse as factories and jobs continue to be lost across the border.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="26"> Mrs Campbell is unlikely to approve any Nafta deal which can be interpreted as 'caving in' to the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="27"> For all three leaders, political constraints are proving inimical to signing a Nafta deal.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="28"> It is ironic that the agreement, once trumpeted as a 'win-win-win' deal for all involved, should now be seen as a liability.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="29"> Part of the 'win-win-win' outcome was to derive from labour-intensive industries migrating to Mexico, while highly skilled production would be concentrated in the US and Canada.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="30"> But the prospect of job losses triggered a furore in low-technology US industries, among trade unions, and among environmental lobbyists.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="31"> It is what prompted Mr Ross Perot, the former presidential candidate, to talk of 'the sucking sound of jobs heading south'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="32"> Environmentalists are convinced that it will be 'dirty industry' that migrates in search of a less rigorous legislative environment in Mexico.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="33"> Mr Ralph Nader, long-time US consumer rights campaigner and head of the Sierra Club environmental group, criticises Mexico's cheap labour.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="34"> He says its 'comparative advantage' stems from its failure to enforce its child labour law, and he insists that no trade agreement will compel Mexican companies to enforce their worker, health or safety laws.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="35"> In contrast, many economists forecast net job gains accruing from Nafta in both Mexico and the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="36"> They also challenge claims of dirty industry migration.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="37"> Using US commerce department figures that each Dollars 1bn of US exports generates 20,000 US jobs, they say the Mexican market has been responsible for the creation of nearly 500,000 US jobs in the past few years.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="38"> Exports to Mexico rose last year to Dollars 44bn.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="39"> But statistics appear to count for little as the battle intensifies to win US congressional backing for Nafta.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="40">. Few congressmen believe Nafta is yet ripe for passage.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="41"> According to Mr John Dingell, Democrat chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, and an opponent of the treaty: 'Every sign I see is that the votes are not present for Nafta to be carried.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="42"> Given that, I think the president is rather prudently holding back'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="43"> Any winning coalition in the House of Representatives and the Senate would need to comprise most of the Republican members, together with about half of the Democrats.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="44"> In the budget vote there was a complete absence of Republican support, which meant everysingle Democratic vote was needed - Vice-President Al Gore cast the decisive vote.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="45"> Building a coalition is a risky strategy for Mr Clinton, both because Republican votes cannot be relied upon and because reliance on his opponents would damage his relationship with fellow Democrats.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="46"> 'I think the president should take a hard look at whether he wants to pass Nafta with a Republican majority,' Mr Dingell warned.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="47"> About 50 of the 176 Republicans in the House, and perhaps as many as nine of the 44 Republican senators currently seem likely to vote against the treaty.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="48"> The votes of potential Nafta supporters on the Democratic side, notably that of Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader who wields considerable political power, remain conditional on the negotiation of satisfactory side agreements.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="49"> Some encouraging signals can be seen across the country however.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="50"> The nation's governors, particularly those in the west, appear to be in favour of the accord.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="51"> A recent survey by the Heritage Foundation showed 40 of 50 governors strongly support the agreement, with 10 undecided or not responding.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="52"> Many of those in favour are impatient at President Clinton's hesitancy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="53"> The protracted delay in the appointment by the administration of a 'Nafta tsar' to co-ordinate the lobbying effort is symbolic of inaction.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="54"> The fact that the Chicago-based Mr William Daley has been offered the post is one of Washington's less well-kept secrets, but Mr Daley appears reluctant to say yes until he is confident Mr Clinton is fully committed to the Nafta.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="55"> Supporters of the treaty have also been frustrated by the administration's behaviour.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="56"> Industrialists who might be expected to campaign vigorously on its behalf are angry that only labour and environmental groups have been consulted about the side agreements.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="57"> An administration blunder is also looming in the appeal it is lodging against a ruling by Washington federal judge Charles Richey.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="58"> In June, he upheld a claim by environmentalists that the administration must prepare an environmental impact statement on Nafta, which could take years.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="59"> Initially, the ruling was thought to put the entire Nafta deal in jeopardy.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="60"> Negotiators then drew comfort from legal opinion that the ruling was likely to be overturned on appeal.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="61"> However, several business lobbyists for Nafta who have seen details of the administration's intended brief have taken the unusual step of preparing an appeal of their own.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="62"> The Nafta deal is nevertheless not yet lost.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="63"> Canadian officials said after this week's talks that the three countries were 'very, very close' to an agreement, but that 'there are a couple of really tough issues which people have to think through'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="64"> There is also the conviction among the negotiators that if Mr Clinton decided that regardless of political cost, the agreement was still i the national interest, then it could be pushed successfully through Congress.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="65"> But doubts remain over his commitment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="66"> As one journalist shouted across the White House lawn at the passing president: 'Sir, have you given up on Nafta'?</s>

<s docid="FT933-9007" num="67"> He smiled, but gave no answer.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="15"> Workers"] [Text] As the International Labour Organization opened its 81st annual conference in Geneva yesterday, ASEAN officials were preparing to table a resolution that would condemn Western attempts to link trade with labour standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="16"> The resolution will also call on the UN agency to review some of its labour standards which ASEAN delegates claim are not based on norms and values of developing countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="17"> But ASEAN's most urgent concern is to win an assurance from the ILO that it will strongly resist the introduction of new conditions binding social clauses and ILO labour standards with market accessibility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="18"> The issue of workers' rights has become particularly sensitive for ASEAN countries, most of which are on a US watchlist for alleged labour violations.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="19"> `Social dumping'</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="20"> At March's final meeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Marrakesh the issue almost scuttled the signing of the new World Trade Organization as developing nations fought off a US and French bid to include labour rights in the new global trade treaty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="21"> The basis of the West's complaint is "social dumping" -- a belief that the lower wages paid to poorer people in developing countries means that firms are able to compete unfairly against employers in more advanced lands, who must provide more benefits for their workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="22"> ASEAN leaders, whose countries have prospered as sources of cheap labour, claim this as a disguised form of protectionism.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="23"> ASEAN officials were correct to resist the insertion of social clauses in a world trade pact because they are protecting the right of their workers to sell their labour on the international market, much in the same way as the West seeks open markets in the East to sell its goods and services.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="24"> But what is alarming about the ASEAN push is that the regional bloc also seems intent on watering down international safeguards for the protection of workers' rights including unionization, safety requirements and basic wages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="25"> Thailand, which has traditionally been more deferential in dealing with Western pressure over worker's rights than neighbours like Malaysia and Singapore, is becoming more and more vocal on the issue.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="26"> While it is encouraging to see Thailand become more assertive in the international arena it is unfortunate it has chosen an area where it has such a bleak record.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="27"> After coming off a year in which it posted a record for the number industrial accidents including the world's worst ever factory fire, it would have been hoped Thailand would be more circumspect about lending its support to an attempt to lower safeguards for the rest of the world's workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="28"> Only last Tuesday, the ILO denounced forced child labour and prostitution in Thailand, and urged the government to take steps to end it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="29"> The report, based on an ILO mission here last September, said children in Thailand continued to be forcibly recruited for work in factories, sweatshops or brothels in Bangkok and in the provinces, adding: "...illegal shops exist by the thousands".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="30"> "The situation is often linked to forced or false recruitment, deception and trafficking," it said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="31"> "Children are exploited because they are young and helpless, they are deprived of the right to lead a normal childhood, deprived of education, deprived of a future".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="32"> The same day as the report came out, police raided a Thonburi sweat shop where 30 girls, some of whom had been there four years, were being forced to work 16 hours a day without pay.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="33"> On being freed, the girls told tales of being beaten regularly and fed rotten food.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="34"> Venal and brutal employers</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="35"> Clearly there is much that needs to be done to curb the excesses of venal and brutal Thai employers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="36"> Last week, the United Nations singled out Thailand, along with a dozen other countries, for the tremendous development it had achieved over the last three decades.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="37"> Much of that success has been due to the fact that Thai workers were willing to toil harder and longer for less pay and in worse conditions than their counterparts in other part of the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="38"> Thai employers have grown rich beyond all expectations and the lives of workers have also improved but there is still much more than can be done before Thailand can be proud of its labour record.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="39"> The government is right to take action to protect the Thai economy from dubiously-intentioned foreign efforts to constrain it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28035" num="40"> But it should not use this position as a pretext to deny Thai workers the rewards and conditions they have labored hard to earn or to weaken the little protection ILO standards offer the rest of the world's workers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="7"> The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) launched a global campaign yesterday to eradicate child labour, including a boycott of exports made by exploited, under-age workers, Reuter reports from Geneva.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="8"> Mr Enzo Friso, general secretary of the world's largest international labour grouping, took the case for a link between trade and labour conditions to Mr Peter Sutherland, chief of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="9"> 'This shameful phenomenon has grown over the last years,' Mr Friso told a news briefing in Geneva.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="10"> 'It is a serious problem which requires state intervention.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="11"> 'We are going to campaign for a boycott to stop goods made by children from gaining access to foreign markets,' he added.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="12"> In a new report, the Brussels-based ICFTU says from 100m to 200m children under 15 are working in streets, factories and mines, mainly in South Asia and Latin America.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="13"> They include children working in coal mines in Colombia, gold mines in Peru, as construction workers in Bangladesh, as 'slaves' in Pakistan weaving carpets, sweet vendors in Mexico, and in garment factories in the Philippines.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="14"> The 13-page report, 'Child Labour: the world's best kept secret', contains documentation from ICFTU affiliates on abuses in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mexico and the Philippines.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="15"> 'A number of multinationals are currently under investigation by ICFTU experts,' it says.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="16"> 'All companies discovered to be using child labour will be exposed and the companies will be the target of special union campaigns'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="17"> Mr Bjorne Grimsrud, ICFTU campaign organiser, declined to name suspected multinationals but said: 'It is important to get to the sub-contractors level because that is where you find the child labour'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="18"> In a statement, ICFTU said the campaign would include an international boycott of hand-woven carpets from Nepal, India and Pakistan, unless they were labelled with a guarantee that child workers were not involved in production.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="19"> The ICFTU has 174 labour union affiliates in 124 countries, representing 120m workers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="20"> During the cold war it campaigned for workers' rights in Communist countries.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="21"> The appeal was made on the fringes of the annual meeting of the International Labour Organisation, whose director general, Mr Michel Hansenne, is also pressing for workers' rights to be closely tied to global economic and trade decisions.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="22"> Mr Friso called for a 'social clause' to be used as an international weapon against child exploitation and other abuses of workers' rights at the future World Trade Organisation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-3471" num="23"> 'We want a social clause. . . to prevent the import of goods from a country when its government does not take measures against exploitation of children,' he said .</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="6"> The 163-nation International Labour Organisation, whose three-week annual conference begins in Geneva today, has yet to find a firm foothold in the post cold-war world.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="7"> Created by western governments, employers and unions in 1919 to demonstrate the caring face of capitalism, in response to the newly formed 'workers' state' of Soviet Russia, its aims include full and productive employment, a 'minimum living wage', tripartism and collective bargaining, and basic social protection.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="8"> Yet today, as the latest ILO World Labour Report indicates, unemployment and poverty are increasing, child labour remains a scourge, and up to 33m workers are in forced labour, such as debt bondage where workers are trapped by debt to an employer.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="9"> Health and safety conditions remain dismal in much of the world, as last month's fire in a Bangkok toy factory, in which more than 200 workers were killed, made tragically clear.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="10"> In the western industrialised countries, trade union membership is declining and tripartism is on the retreat.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="11"> Critics from both left and right question the ILO's priorities, effectiveness and, in particular, the role of international labour standards.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="12"> 'The machine churning out conventions has gone mad,' says one western government official.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="13"> 'There's no point in adopting more and more detailed conventions if they have no effect on labour conditions'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="14"> The ILO's 173 conventions and 180 recommendations cover basic human and worker rights - freedom of association, elimination of child labour and forced labour, non-discrimination - as well as detailed norms on health and safety, social security and wage determination.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="15"> This year's annual conference is considering standards on prevention of serious industrial accidents and on protection of part-time workers.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="16"> But governments have no obligation to ratify conventions and there are no penalties attached to breaching them.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="17"> Egregious violations of the most basic human rights - such as the murder or jailing of trade unionists - are punished by no more than a public rebuke.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="18"> The ILO's worst sanction is the so-called 'special paragraph', which singles out the country - last year, Sudan - for the attention of the annual conference.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="19"> The British government has been criticised eight times for violating the ILO's freedom of association convention, notably for its ban on unions at the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="20"> Mr Marcello Malentacchi, general secretary of the International Metalworkers' Federation, warned in a speech last April that the ILO was in danger of being marginalised.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="21"> In addition, the ILO, which employs 1,800 people and has an annual budget of nearly Dollars 300m, has come under fire for its sluggish bureaucracy and cumbersome tripartite structure, in which employers and unions as well as governments are represented.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="22"> Some argue that, as a result, the ILO has been slow to respond effectively to the globalisation of the world economy and changing patterns of employment.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="23"> There is also concern that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been able to seize the initiative on labour issues in developing nations and in eastern Europe, often with scant regard for ILO principles of social justice, democracy and human rights.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="24"> The ILO is now embroiled in an important debate on its direction.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="25"> The employers' side wants the ILO to place less emphasis on standard-setting, which it argues can hamper job creation, and pay more attention to promoting employment.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="26"> Mr Jean-Jacques Oechslin, chairman of the employers' group, says the ILO should be helping with training programmes and encouraging improved labour mobility.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="27"> 'The biggest problem in industrialised and developing countries is employment,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="28"> 'This can't be tackled by voting for conventions.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="29"> It has to be done by action in the field'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="30"> Mr Eddy Laurijssen, director of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and secretary of the workers' group in the ILO, says that growing joblessness has often coincided with falling employment standards.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="31"> He says the ILO should be pushing social issues to the top of the international agenda, especially with the IMF and World Bank, and making standards more effective.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="32"> Mr Michel Hansenne, the ILO's Belgian director-general, who was last week re-elected for a second five-year term, says standards are the backbone of the organisation and must remain so.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="33"> He concedes, however, that with the exception of the 15 or so core human rights standards, such as freedom of association, these need not always take the form of international conventions.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="34"> He also defends the ILO's preference for measured disapproval of rule breaches and behind-the-scenes persuasion.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="35"> 'I don't think it would be wise to transform ourselves into a public accuser,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="36"> Countries would lose confidence in the ILO and might prefer to denounce conventions rather than be pilloried for breaches of them.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="37"> Nevertheless, critics compare the organisation's quietly launched 'global offensive' against child labour, which may affect 100m to 200m children worldwide, with the high-profile campaign by Unicef, the UN children's fund, for a consumer boycott of carpets made by children.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="38"> In the US, trade preferences can be withdrawn from countries which abuse worker rights and there are moves in Congress to ban all imports of goods made by children.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="39"> The workers' group in the ILO wants the organisation to back a 'social clause' in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which would permit trading partners to impose trade sanctions on countries which exploit their workers and thereby gain competitive advantage.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="40"> Mr Hansenne points out that from the start the ILO's role was to combat 'social dumping' by setting international norms but says the Gatt social clause debate is in danger of confusing two different issues.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="41"> The first, of central ILO concern, is whether a new mechanism is needed to enforce basic human rights standards worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="42"> Such a social clause in the Gatt would include, for example, the ILO's core standards (such as freedom of association and elimination of forced labour) that embody universally accepted fundamental human rights.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="43"> The second is what international fair competition rules there should be in an open trading system, and the extent to which these should cover labour conditions such as minimum wages or social security protection.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="44"> This debate, while important, does not relate to enforcement of ILO norms, says Mr Hansenne.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="45"> Meanwhile, the ILO has already embarked on reorganisation to try to improve its effectiveness.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="46"> Technical assistance is to be tied more directly to the promotion of standards.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="47"> And the organisation is moving 'closer to the customer' with its so-called 'active partnership' policy.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="48"> This seeks to promote agreements among governments, unions and employers on priorities for labour and social policies and technical assistance in each country.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="49"> In a linked move, the first of 14 regional teams has been set up in Budapest to help the ILO cope with burgeoning demands from central and eastern European countries.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="50"> These demands range from assistance in setting up tripartite industrial relations structures, to helping establish labour exchange networks and drafting social security legislation.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="51"> The debate on the organisation's future will culminate next year when the ILO celebrates its 75th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Philadelphia, which elaborated its constitution.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="52"> By the time of the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, Mr Hansenne hopes a rejuvenated ILO will show the way towards a 'new world order' which can marry economic development with respect for human rights.</s>

<s docid="FT932-5791" num="53"> But to exert greater influence on governments and employers, the ILO will have to define its role more clearly and be prepared to make its voice heard.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-50569" num="16"> The "Notice" points out that the level of wages in foreign-funded and privately run enterprises cannot be lower than the level stipulated by the state and local governments, that the enterprises should give pay increases to workers in a timely manner according to the inflation index in the country and to the production and operation conditions of the enterprises, and that the enterprises must give full wages to workers on time and in the form of hard currency and must not owe them wages or deduct their wages.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="15"> To Extend Social Clause"] [Text] On the eve of the launch of the World Trade Organization [WTO], French employers are discussing the urgent need for the introduction of a social clause into the principles governing international trade.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="16"> "The mere prospect of the PRC joining GATT and then the WTO in the near future makes the solution of this problem a matter of the utmost urgency," Francois de Laage de Meux, president of the CNPF [National Council of French Employers] International Commission, stresses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="17"> Although the establishment of the future WTO, which should replace GATT by 1 July 1995 at the latest according to the final act of the Uruguay Round, has gained political acceptance, its sphere of competence still has to be defined.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="18"> Governing the "Fairness of Trade"</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="19"> Gerard Longuet [the foreign trade and industry minister] said at the last cabinet meeting that "during the Marrakesh conference, France will pay particular attention to including on the WTO's agenda all questions which may have an impact on the fairness of trade".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="20"> Indeed there are four such questions: environmental protection, social clause, monetary parity, and unfair competition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="21"> With regard to the environment, an agreement was reached in Geneva last week on the setting up of a multilateral negotiation group.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="22"> With regard to monetary parity, the IMF's preserve, a decision in Marrakesh is out of the question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="23"> Unfair competition (agreements, dominant monopolistic positions) could be discussed but without necessarily immediately starting negotiations.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="24"> Multilateral Social Code of Ethics Being Planned</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="25"> That leaves the social clause on which Paris and Washington seem to have similar views.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="26"> Although the content of the provisions has not been specified, the developing countries see it as a new means of "imperialist" domination.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="27"> Francois de Laage de Meux, president of the CNPF's International Commission, states that the "CNPF's target is not the wage disparities due to differences in development".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="28"> However, the future members of the WTO could agree on "a multilateral social code of ethics adopting the International Labor Organization's [ILO] main conventions".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="29"> For instance those relating to the prohibition of child labor and enforced labor, or the obligation for collective negotiation and trade union freedom.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="30"> And the employers' leader added that, not only in the PRC, but also in some other countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Peru), enforced prison labor and child labor affect relatively large sections of the population.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="31"> The CNPF adds that other ILO conventions should also be included in the WTO's agenda: minimum wages, paid leave, rest days, equal pay, maternity provisions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20336" num="32"> It is difficult to see how the developing countries could avoid feeling that they are the targets.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="9"> The US, backed by the European Union and other industrialised nations, says its object is not to remove the comparative advantage of low labour-cost countries, but to curb human rights abuses such as bans on trade union membership, forced labour and child exploitation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="10"> Though not on the formal agenda, the idea of a 'social clause' in Gatt is expected to feature strongly in discussions at the annual conference of the International Labour Organisation, which begins next week in Geneva.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="11"> Mr Michel Hansenne, director-general of the UN agency, has said he personally favours a 'social clause' related to the ILO's core conventions: the right to form trade unions and bargain collectively, and the ban on forced labour.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="12"> These, he argues, are basic human rights and can be applied by countries at any level of development.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="13"> He proposes making a ban on child labour effective within five to 10 years.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="14"> A report by an ILO committee published yesterday urges the ILO to tighten enforcement of international labour standards, singling out breaches of the forced labour convention including forced child labour and child prostitution.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="15"> The ILO now relies mainly on moral persuasion and, in rare cases, public condemnation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6206" num="16"> The report calls for closer scrutiny of compliance with the core human rights conventions, possible compensation for those adversely affected by violations of ILO standards and voluntary mediation and arbitration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-65867" num="30"> Labour would immediately sign the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-65867" num="31"> Meanwhile its MEPs [members of the European Parliament] would strive for a guaranteed minimum wage improved health and safety at work, the right to belong to a trade union, equal opportunities for women, and protection against redundancy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-65867" num="39"> The manifesto mentions incentives for farmers to manage land in socially and environmentally acceptable ways, promoting the cultivation of healthy food at prices all can afford, and encouraging small producers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-65867" num="40"> Labour wants better conditions for the transport of animals an end to cruel battery farming and changes to the Treaty of Rome, treating animals as "sentient beings".</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="6"> THE dusty care-worn villagers wait expectantly.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="7"> They have travelled to Mirzapur, the sprawling north Indian city which is the centre of the country's carpet industry, hoping for a miracle.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="8"> The man they have come so far to see smiles reassuringly and says: 'We'll get your children back'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="9"> He picks up the telephone and so begins a desperate effort to rescue the men's sons from illegal bonded labour.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="10"> The villagers have travelled by bus for days from their poverty-stricken farms.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="11"> All are illiterate Untouchables, members of India's lowest caste and an easy target for exploitation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="12"> To ease their lives of abject poverty, they have sold their sons to carpet loom owners in return for Rs500 each and promises of well-paid work for the boys.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="13"> Now, they want them back.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="14"> This tall man with the black beard is their last hope.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="15"> He is Kailaish Satyarthi, a 37-year-old former electrical engineer, who has given up his career to become a social activist.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="16"> To the horror of his family, he has also abandoned his own caste, the priestly Brahmins, to fight for the rights of Untouchables.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="17"> Satyarthi telephones Suresh Kumar Singh, the local magistrate, who is required by law to investigate violations of India's child labour legislation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="18"> But he is unobtainable, said by officials to be 'too busy' to answer the call.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="19"> After a fruitless six-hour wait, Satyarthi, accompanied by fellow campaigners against child servitude and a number of journalists, storms Singh's office - only to find it empty.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="20"> They wait in vain for a further hour, sitting on chairs before a large desk on which is written the motto: 'Good public relations is the best policy'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="21"> Eventually, a message comes, proposing a 7pm meeting at Singh's house.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="22"> Armed guards meet the group at the magistrate's colonial-style mansion.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="23"> They lead the way inside where a smiling Singh apologises to Satyarthi for the delay - and promptly suggests postponing the meeting to the next day.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="24"> Barely able to control himself, Satyarthi refuses.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="25"> He insists that Singh or one his subordinates accompanies the group to rescue the children.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="26"> 'It's your duty,' he argues.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="27"> Singh asks for the location of the two villages where the children are believed to be held and promises, in the best bureaucratic tradition, to see what he can do.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="28"> CHILD labour is banned in India in many industries, including carpet weaving.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="29"> Bonded labour, where the workers' freedom of movement is restricted, is illegal for employees of any age.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="30"> But India lacks the resources to properly police laws on child labour, as on many other social evils.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="31"> The authorities are often loathe to upset businessmen such as the loom owners of Mirzapur who make a profitable living employing children to produce hand-knotted carpets for the showrooms of London, Berlin and New York.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="32"> Still less does the country have the means to quickly eradicate the economic pressures which force parents to sell their children into bondage, not just in the carpet industry but also in metalwork, quarrying and the manufacture of fireworks.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="33"> Moreover, even though caste equality is enshrined in the Indian constitution, caste consciousness makes many Indians insensitive to exploitation of Untouchables.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="34"> Slavery is an emotive term, child slavery particularly so.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="35"> But it is difficult to see the bonded child labourers of Mirzapur as anything other than child slaves.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="36"> The words are repugnant to carpet manufacturers and to officials of the textiles ministry.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="37"> However, as early as 1984, a local government official in Uttar Pradesh province, which includes Mirzapur, admitted the truth in a note for a visiting labour ministry delegation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="38"> He wrote: 'The apprentices and wage earners.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="39">. . often work in conditions of semi-slavery'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="40"> Ignorance, greed and corruption ensure that the law is widely flouted in rural India.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="41"> A Supreme Court Commission estimates that 75,000 children work in the carpet industry alone - most of them bonded workers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="42"> Anti-child labour campaigners put the figure at 300,000.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="43"> Carpet industry employers maintain such figures are 'lies' and insist there is no bonded child labour in the industry.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="44"> The events of Satyarthi's rescue raid, which I witnessed, suggest otherwise.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="45"> The mission begins the morning after our tense meeting with the magistrate.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="46"> Somewhat to our surprise, Singh has been as good as his word and arranged for a junior magistrate and four policemen armed with ancient ex-army rifles to travel with us.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="47"> (It later emerges that Singh also found time to warn carpet industry bosses about the raids, as Satyarthi had feared).</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="48"> One father, Paltan Ram, said he sold his eight-years-old son Madan Lal to a loom owner for Rs500.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="49"> Only later did he realise he, along with other parents, were losing their children for good.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="50"> To their horror, they discovered loom owners banned home visits and, sometimes, contact of any kind.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="51"> Paltan Ram says when he tried to visit his son, he was driven away by a man armed with a shotgun.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="52"> He and the others arrived in Mirzapur after hearing about Satyarthi's campaign from his co-workers, volunteers who travel to remote villages to collect information and contact parents who want to recover their children.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="53"> (Although the families did not say, another spur may be the government grants of Rs6,250 for the families of rescued bonded labourers).</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="54"> Satyarthi tries to reassure the fathers as they stand in silence waiting for the rescue to begin.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="55"> The junior magistrate seems distinctly unhappy about his assignment.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="56"> Perhaps he is afraid there might be violence - as there was on previous rescue raids.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="57"> Perhaps he does not relish the idea of challenging the carpet industry bosses, a power in the land in Mirzapur.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="58"> We drive out of the city in a dusty convoy of battered vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="59"> Along the roadside stand the weavers' workshops, mostly huts housing a weaver and his family and one or two wooden looms.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="60"> Every so often, there are large factories and warehouses - the premises of exporters who dominate the industry.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="61"> They take orders from overseas buyers and then parcel out work to the loom owners, who in turn employ the weavers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="62"> As we reach deeper into the countryside, the road deteriorates into a sandy track.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="63"> The cars swerve constantly to avoid children, animals and the occasional bullock cart.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="64"> The boys' fathers sit in silence, their faces drawn and fingers clenched.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="65"> Satyarthi says he is worried that the delays may have given the loom owners a chance to learn about the planned raids.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="66"> As we near the first of the two chosen villages, the vehicles slow down and stop.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="67"> We jump out and run through a maize field to some mud-brick huts surrounded by trees.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="68"> Satyarthi heads straight for a large hut with a loom outside it, and discovers three boys cowering inside.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="69"> Satyarthi rushes outside.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="70"> 'There must be more.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="71"> Search everywhere,' he shouts to his fellow campaigners.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="72"> The activists fan out across the village and into the surrounding fields.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="73"> They find three more boys.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="74"> Six altogether.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="75"> Satyarthi is disappointed - he had expected eight.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="76"> The loom owner is also missing.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="77"> Satyarthi urges the group back into the cars - it is essential to reach the second village before word about the first raid spreads.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="78"> Already about 50 villagers are milling around us.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="79"> As before, we drive as close as possible to the village, and then rush in on foot.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="80"> Satyarthi sprints into a courtyard where the looms are housed behind walls studded with broken glass.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="81"> But it is too late.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="82"> The boys he expected to find are gone.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="83"> Paltan Ram, Madan Lal's father, is distraught.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="84"> 'I want to die,' he says, tears welling up in his tired, blood-shot eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="85"> But all is not lost.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="86"> Searching through one of the village huts, Satyarthi's co-workers find the loom owner, Govind Singh.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="87"> They drag him before the junior magistrate, demanding action.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="88"> 'What are you waiting for?</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="89"> The parents are here.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="90"> The loom owner is here.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="91"> You have the power to hold a summary trial,' shouts Satyarthi.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="92"> He pulls out a file containing the details of child labour legislation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="93"> 'The maximum penalty is three years' jail,' he says, glaring at the loom owner.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="94"> The junior magistrate now seems more uncomfortable than ever.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="95"> As he sits wondering what to do, the loom owner's servants come out with water and biscuits and beds for the visitors to sit on.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="96"> Satyarthi takes written statements from the fathers, including lines expressing their fears that the loom owner might kill their children.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="97"> He threatens the loom owner, saying he would be charged with kidnapping unless he produced the boys.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="98"> For more than an hour, we sit in the sun as the junior magistrate, the loom owner and Satyarthi talk and shout at each other.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="99"> Eventually, the loom owner caves in and promises to surrender the children.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="100"> He leaves, accompanied by the junior magistrate.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="101"> Another 30 minutes' wait.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="102"> Finally, the junior magistrate and the loom owner return, bringing with them three boys.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="103"> Shyly, they take their fathers' hands, barely understanding what is going on.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="104"> Among them is Madan Lal.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="105"> Paltan Ram hugs his son saying: 'I feel so good'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="106"> Madan Lal allows Satyarthi to examine him.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="107"> His arms are covered with scars from scabies, caused by a common allergy to wool.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="108"> On one finger he has a cut, black with diesel oil, which the loom owner applied to the wound to stop the blood from staining the carpets.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="109"> The junior magistrate reluctantly arrests Govind Singh, the loom owner.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="110"> Satyarthi is triumphant.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="111"> The rescued boys and their fathers walk quietly back to the cars, overwhelmed by what has happened.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="112"> Back in Mirzapur, the boys are registered by clerks at the district magistrate's office.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="113"> Madan Lal is the youngest.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="114"> The oldest is 15 and has spent five years at the loom.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="115"> All look thin, and several have signs of scabies.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="116"> For the most part, the boys have few complaints about their food, which consisted of thin soups, vegetables and bread.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="117"> But in almost every other way they were abused.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="118"> They worked 12 hours a day from 6am to 6pm, with three half-hour breaks for meals - seven days a week, every week of the year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="119"> They were rarely allowed out of the huts in which they worked and slept.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="120"> One says: 'Even when I went to relieve myself (in the fields), someone went with me'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1107" num="121"> They were never paid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="18"> India: U.S."] [Text] Washington, Feb. 1--In a wide-ranging critique of the Indian law and order agencies, the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="19"> State Department has said that "despite extensive constitutional and statutory safeguards, significant human rights abuses persist throughout India".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="20"> The severe charges against India are part of the department's annual survey of human rights record of the governments worldwide, that was released here today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="21"> The human rights abuses in India are "aggravated by severe social tensions and the authorities' attempts to contain violent secessionist movements," says the State Department.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="22"> The abuses are particularly acute in disturbed areas such as Punjab and Kashmir, "where the judicial system has broken down in the face of terrorist threats".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="23"> Areas of abuse: The areas of abuse in India listed by the State Department is long and includes extra-judicial and reprisal killings by security forces in Kashmir, Punjab and the Northeast, political killings, kidnapping and extortion by militants, torture, rape and death in custody all over India, detention for prolonged periods without charges, inadequate prosecution of implicated personnel from the police and security forces, inter-caste and communal violence, legal discrimination and social violence against women, lax prosecution of dowry deaths and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded and child labour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="24"> The State Department has been presenting these annual reports on human rights violations to the U.S. Congress since 1977.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="25"> The U.S. Congress has been demanding that the country's foreign and trade policies take into account the performance of various countries on human rights and workers' rights.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="26"> Six sections: The reporting on each country is divided into six sections: respect for human rights, respect for civil liberties, practice of political rights, attitude to human rights activists, social discrimination and workers rights.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="27"> Almost half of the report on India is devoted to the first section on violation of human rights, particularly in Punjab and Kashmir.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="28"> Although the militant groups come for some criticism, the fire of the State Department is reserved mostly for the Indian police and security forces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="29"> It is sharply critical of a number of the Indian legal instruments such as the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security Act, the conditions in Indian prisons, and the general functioning of the police and judicial system in dealing with militants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="30"> Only modest results: The State Department notes that New Delhi has begun to address the international concerns on human rights violations in India by creating the Human Rights Commission and entering into a dialogue with international human rights groups.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="31"> But it suggests that "these efforts have produced only modest results".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="32"> It notes the "Indian Government's claim that 146 security force personnel had been disciplined for acts of omission and commission during the operations in Kashmir over the past three years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="33"> Since the Indian Government did not publicise the forms of punishment or the crimes involved," it was impossible to judge the adequacy of the punishment".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="34"> It also notes that among the Kashmiris, "there is a general impression that official abuse goes unpunished".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="35"> On New Delhi's relation to human rights activists in the country, the State Department says that despite the generally tolerant attitude, "human rights monitors have been targeted by the police for arrest and harassment".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="36"> T.N. Govt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="37"> flayed: On civil liberties, the State Department notes the Constitutional protection of freedom of speech and the press in India.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="38"> It recognises the vigorous press in India but cites instances of harassment by the Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="39"> It is critical of the Tamil Nadu Government for putting pressure on the opposition press and using "defamation charges in the courts to intimidate editors and journalists".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="40"> On freedom of religion, the State Department refers to the freedom of worship in India and notes the growing challenges to the secular foundation of the Indian State.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="41"> It is sharply critical of the role of the Bombay police during the communal riots in that city during early 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="42"> On discrimination against women, the State Department notes that despite an elaborate system of laws, "deeply rooted traditions lead to lax and some times no enforcement of these laws, especially in rural areas".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="43"> On trade union rights, the survey reports the general respect for the right to organise, but comments that "as with other peripheral groups in Indian society, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers cannot always avail themselves of protections and rights guaranteed by law".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="44"> The survey notes that the eradication of bonded labour in India is only "proceeding slowly".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21373" num="45"> It also says that the legal provisions in India have had little impact on the use of child labour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="15"> Threatens Fragile GATT Deal"] [Text] A Disagreement over plans to incorporate workers rights into international free trade rules threatens to shatter a fragile coalition of support for the Uruguay Round of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, little more than a fortnight before the world trade agreement is due to be signed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="16"> Plans to put workers' rights on the agenda of the proposed World Trade Organisation are being pushed vigorously by the United States and France, but have angered almost 100 developing countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="17"> India's ambassador to GATT, Balkrishnon Zutshi, has warned that divisions over the need for a "social clause" could wreck the Uruguay Round agreement due to be signed by ministers from 119 countries in Marrakesch next month after eight years of negotiation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="18"> The GATT's 45-year-old improvised structure is to be subsumed into a new, more powerful, world trade watchdog, the World Trade Organisation, at the meeting in Morocco between 12 and 15 April.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="19"> Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, who is expected to become the first head of the WTO, has given cautious endorsement to the introduction of a social clause in world trade legislation -- once the WTO is operational.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="20"> However, aggressive lobbying by Washington has forced the European Union [EU] to bring forward the discussion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="21"> The EU wants to prevent the Clinton Administration stealing a march on it to set the agenda, unopposed, before Marrakesch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="22"> The United States argues that the trade liberalising benefits of the Uruguay Round should not boost countries which produce cheap goods by exploiting workers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="23"> It wants to see child and forced labour banned and trade union rights guaranteed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="24"> Countries that do not meet international social standards should be penalised by losing trade privileges.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="25"> Developing countries, which now comprise more than two-thirds of GATT members, protest that export revenue is a vital ingredient in new social reform programmes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="26"> Some countries stand to lose more than others.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="27"> Wouldbe GATT member China has been criticised for its sweatshop work regime and a host of other Asian countries are likely to fall foul of Western standards which legislate against child labour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="28"> Introducing a social clause into the GATT has the backing of a worldwide coalition of trade union organisations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="29"> The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, World Confederation of Labour, and European Trade Union Confederation, argue that in order to "improve social conditions, the most appropriate way to prevent social dumping is to include social clauses in trade agreements".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="30"> They say that: "Only in the last resort would trade sanctions be used as a penalty for non co-operation".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="31"> The unions also have an unlikely ally in Sir Leon Brittan, the European Trade Commissioner, who believes a social clause should be put firmly on the WTO agenda.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="32"> "It will be a more political organisation, with a wider remit and more frequent direct ministerial involvement, than has been the case for GATT," he told members of the European Parliament.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="33"> Brittan, however, warns against heavy-handed bullying by the West.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="34"> He said: "I think that if these principles are more widely understood, developing country governments will come to accept that the WTO [World Trade Organisation] should have a social dimension".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="35"> This view is not yet universally accepted, however.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="36"> The European Employers, Federation (UNICE) is wary of carving social standards into stone, urging the need to avoid simplistic solutions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="37"> "The issues of social clauses are important; they uphold the aims of protecting children, and other areas of civil liberty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="38"> But we wouldn't go along with putting this into GATT yet," said a spokeswoman for the business lobby.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="39"> UNICE argues instead for faster growth and higher living standards as the route to improved conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="40"> Euro-MP Bartho Pronk, a Dutch Christian Democrat, says that in order to be fair and effective the social clause should be limited to fundamental and minimum standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="41"> Pronk argues that compliance with the social clause should only be applied to countries seeking preferential trading status under the GATT or another -- bilateral or regional -- trading arrangements.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="42"> The idea is not new, notes Pronk.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="43"> Levi Strauss, perhaps the best known brand of denim clothing, and the Swiss retailer Migros already insist that suppliers and sub-contractors respect minimum standards, including a ban on child labour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="44"> But he says the EU must decide first whether a social clause in GATT, or other trade agreements, such as the Union's generalised system of preferences, is an instrument of trade or social policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="45"> Low wages alone are insufficient reason for the introduction of a social clause.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="46"> Pronk says: "While huge disparities in labour costs do exist within the international economy I am of the view that this should not be the basis of a social clause.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-20402" num="47"> To do so would be to penalise the less developed countries for their level of development and would open the social clause to criticism that it is Western protectionism in another form".</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="7"> THE NEW side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated by the US, Mexico and Canada lay down principles and objectives for labour and environmental protection standards in the three countries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="8"> But they also establish a disputes procedure that trade ministers claim will give real bite to the pact.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="9"> 'These are historic, groundbreaking agreements and have real teeth,' Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="10"> The disputes procedure has been the main sticking point in negotiations over the last week, with Canada firmly resisting US demands for trade sanctions to be levied if a country does not live up to its obligations under Nafta.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="11"> Telephone talks dragged from Monday, when formal negotiations broke up, until early yesterday morning, before a compromise was found that accepts a different procedure for Canada than that applied to the US and Mexico.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="12"> The disputes mechanism aims to punish the failure by central or local governments in the three countries to enforce their own labour or environmental laws, rather than the actual breach of those laws by a company or individual.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="13"> If complaints of non-enforcement brought by one country against another cannot be satisfied by consultations, an arbitration panel of experts may be set up, on the vote of two out of the three Nafta signatories.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="14"> This panel can rule that a country 'has engaged in a persistent pattern of failure to effectively enforce'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="15"> If no action plan to remedy this failure can be agreed on, it can then fine the offending government up to Dollars 20m - a maximum that will be adjusted upwards as the volume of trade between the three countries increases.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="16"> The split between the negotiators involved the action that would be taken if a country refused to pay this fine or continued in its failure to enforce its labour or environmental laws.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="17"> If the US or Mexico defies a panel ruling, the complaining country may impose trade sanctions by suspending the Nafta benefits in proportion to the amount of the fine.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="18"> This would in effect mean tariffs being raised back towards pre-Nafta levels in specified areas.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="19"> Canada, however, has insisted that its own courts should enforce the fine and the action plan.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="20"> 'The Canadians, with I think some credibility, said their courts were perfectly competent to enforce these orders,' said Mr Kantor, adding that the Canadian courts would not be able to review or hear appeals against a Nafta panel ruling.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="21"> The key principles of the labour agreement - clearly targeted at Mexico - require each country to promote freedom of association, the right to strike and to bargain collectively, a ban on forced labour, restrictions on child labour, equal pay for men and women, compensation for work accidents and the protection of migrant workers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="22"> While the disputes procedure takes aim only at a country's failure to enforce its laws, rather than at any possible inadequacy in those laws, the Nafta does require each signatory to improve working conditions and living standards over time, with annual reviews set up under the side agreements.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="23"> US trade unions have been critical of Nafta, which they believe will allow Mexico to suck jobs away from the US because of lower wages and weaker worker protection and safety standards.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="24"> Conservation groups have complained that the treaty would encourage companies to set up dirty factories on the Mexican side of the border, where they would be subjected to lower pollution control standards.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="25"> The environmental pact does not set out a list of principles, but the three countries commit themselves to high levels of environmental protection.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="26"> Under the agreements, no country may lower its standards of environmental or labour protection: new laws must set higher standards.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="27"> Mexico and the US also agreed to set up a border environment institution to co-ordinate and finance action on water and solid waste pollution in the region along their common frontier.</s>

<s docid="FT933-8677" num="28"> No agreement has yet been reached on the amount of money needed for this - estimates have ranged from around Dollars 7bn to Dollars 30bn - but Mr Kantor insisted this would be completed in time for the whole Nafta agreement to be submitted formally to the US Congress in September.</s>
