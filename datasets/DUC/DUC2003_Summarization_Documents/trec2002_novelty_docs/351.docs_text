<s docid="FT934-4848" num="6"> Early findings from seismic surveys conducted this year in the south Atlantic around the Falkland Islands suggest a possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent larger than the British North Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="7"> The British Geological Survey, which advises the island's government, said its reading of preliminary data from the two surveys suggested the region had a good potential for finding oil.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="8"> Confirmation, however, would require exploratory drilling.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="9"> Mr Nigel Fannin, principal geologist in the survey's petroleum geology group, based in Edinburgh, said the data suggested a sedimentary basin of potential oil-bearing rocks of 200,000 sq km around the island, compared with 160,000 sq km of such formations in the British North Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="10"> 'We have been very encouraged by what we have seen,' he added.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="11"> The two seismic surveys concentrated on areas to the south, west and the north of the islands, where the water is shallower than to the east.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="12"> Mr Fannin said the rocks and geological formations both appeared similar to those of the North Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="13"> Other conditions would also be similar: the water was 500 metres deep or less, and the sea state and weather would be similar to that experienced in the northern zones of the North Sea.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="14"> However, Britain's Foreign Office played down the significance of the findings.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="15"> It said full seismic data would only become available next year and many further steps would be needed before it was known whether commercial quantities of oil existed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="16"> Mr Fannin said the data should be complete by early next year, and the survey expected to be in a position to advise the island government on licensing for exploratory drilling by next summer.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="17"> A licensing regime has yet to be established and remains a sensitive issue, with the sovereignty of the islands still disputed between Britain and Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4848" num="18"> Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has kept open the possibility of co-operation on oil exploration.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="6"> Britain's Foreign Office yesterday played down the significance of a survey suggesting a good chance of finding oil in the South Atlantic around the Falkland Islands.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="7"> Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential is good all around the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="8"> But we will not know exactly how much oil is there until someone starts digging'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="9"> The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the North Sea, the survey said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="10"> But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary, since full seismic data would only become available next year.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="11"> It further emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence of oil.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="12"> A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="13"> Only after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="14"> Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="15"> Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said this year that co-operation on oil exploration with Argentina remained a possibility.</s>

<s docid="FT934-4856" num="16"> Oil company executives have said large-scale investment of oil development in the region would require a more explicit agreement on sovereignty than exists at present.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="7"> THE FALKLAND ISLANDS gov-ernment is inviting tenders for seismic studies in disputed territorial waters in the South Atlantic, in effect excluding Argentina from the initial search for oil in the area.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="8"> Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area - such as full-scale exploration - must await agreement between London and Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="9"> However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on every stage of the Falklands' oil programme.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="10"> Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="13"> Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15099" num="14"> But the Foreign Office in London said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6603" num="9"> It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil reserves.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6603" num="10"> However, there has been no exploration in the region since an inconclusive survey in the 1970s.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6603" num="11"> Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to the fore.</s>

<s docid="FT921-6603" num="13"> Major gasfields have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="8"> Britain wants to replace a one-year accord struck last December with a long-term agreement that protects the Falkland islands' revenues, while Argentina wants to increase substantially its fishing effort.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="9"> The unresolved dispute over the Falklands, which Argentina claims despite defeat in its 1982 conflict with Britain, charges the talks with considerable political significance.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="11"> Although it agreed in December to sell only 45 licences, it still forced a 12 per cent drop in the islands' licensing revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="12"> In the financial year ending in June, the Falklands raised Pounds 23.5m in licensing revenues, compared with Pounds 26.8m in 1991-92.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="13"> The Falklands Fisheries Directorate is planning to lower the price of its licences further and forecasts revenues this year of only Pounds 15m to Pounds 15.5m.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13954" num="14"> Argentina also protested against London's decision earlier this year to extend to 200 miles the territorial waters surrounding the British-held South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina also claims.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="6"> MEASURED by the ratio of military to civilians, the Falkland Islands must have the most heavily defended population on earth.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="7"> The colony's 2,200 inhabitants, almost all of British descent, barely outnumber the 2,000 UK airmen, soldiers and sailors posted there.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="8"> Since the 1982 UK-Argentine conflict over the islands, an influx of new blood has reversed the population decline.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="9"> But numbers have never been much greater than today and as a surge of prosperity based on squid fishery peters out, nothing short of an oil bonanza is likely to change that.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="10"> The two communities live apart.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="11"> Most servicemen are housed at Mount Pleasant, a new airfield complex built on a peat bog 35 miles from Stanley, the capital, along a road that (although the islands' best) is only partly tarmac.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="12"> They are pretty self-sufficient.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="13"> A sore point, under discussion with local authorities, is that mess kitchens use New Zealand lamb, in a territory whose treeless, wind-battered expanses serve little productive purpose except as grazing for 750,000 sheep.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="14"> The meat comes by way of Britain, 8,400 miles away, in what is probably the longest voyage ever undertaken by a meat carcase.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="15"> The thing is that the islands have no EC-standard abattoir and they say they cannot now afford one.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="16"> Nevertheless, the armed forces are the islands' biggest cash customer, and the biggest tourism earner.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="17"> They are warmly appreciated.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="18"> Military flights, which anywhere else might be considered a nuisance, provide reassurance.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="19"> 'We get complaints when people don't low-fly enough,' says Rear Admiral Neil Rankin, British forces commander.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="20"> Islanders worry about the improving relations between London and Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="21"> The need to co-operate with Argentina, whether on fisheries or on future oil development, is a bitter pill to swallow.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="22"> The scars from 1982 show no sign of healing.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="23"> Argentine citizens are still banned.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="24"> There are no transport connections.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="25"> The main link to the outside world is the 18-hour, twice-weekly flight to the UK by RAF Tristar.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="26"> The garrison, with a few Tornado fighters, heavy Hercules aircraft, helicopters and a frigate, is designed to hold the base until reinforcements arrive in a crisis.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="27"> Running expenses are put at Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year, not counting the pay servicemen would get anyway, nor the cost of the RAF staging post on Ascension Island.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="28"> In spite of the 'firm and unwavering commitment' pledged during a visit this week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, the number of military personnel may be reduced.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="29"> But the islanders' numbers could dwindle, too.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="30"> Sixth-formers go to the UK; there may be less reason for them to come back.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="31"> Prospects opened up after the war.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="32"> Under a programme to bring land into local ownership, farm employee Mr Robin Marsh bought 20,000 acres in West Falkland, the smaller of the two main islands, with 5,000 sheep.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="33"> But for the past three years, as world wool prices have plummeted, he has depended on support from the Falkland Islands government.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="34"> This support may now stop.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="35"> The government tapped unprecedented wealth from a licence regime set up in 1987 for vessels fishing within a 150-mile zone.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="36"> The boats are mostly squid 'jiggers' from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and southern Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="37"> Government revenue, previously about Pounds 6m a year from wool tax receipts and UK grand aid, shot up to an unaided Pounds 40m.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="38"> But last year Argentina launched a rival licence scheme, a move widely seen in the islands as deliberate economic pressure.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="39"> Argentina is in a powerful position, since the young squid move south to the Falklands through its waters.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="40"> It agreed with Britain last December to limit this season's number of licences.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="41"> But the Falklands have slashed their estimate of licence earnings for the financial year just ending from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15m.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="42"> Next year, government officials say, the planning figure is just Pounds 10m.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="43"> At the islands' secretariat on Thatcher Drive, Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive, describes it as 'perhaps the greatest reduction in revenue that any country will experience short of having a war'.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="44"> Public works, including the upgrading of tracks into something resembling proper roads, have run out of money.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="45"> The good times have nonetheless left their imprint.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="46"> A new hospital and school have been built.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="47"> With a gradual migration from 'camp' - the country areas - residents say Stanley has become more bustling and urban.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="48"> Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles can be spotted among the Land Rovers.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="49"> Outlying settlements now have telephones and next month should receive television programmes.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="50"> But where else do the armed forces provide the only television service?</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="51"> Sparseness, Englishness and remoteness make for an odd society.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="52"> Darts matches and sheepdog trials are covered live on radio.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="53"> The islands have no cash machine, no Indian restaurant, no illegal drugs and as yet no dole.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="54"> There are as many species of penguin as pubs.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="55"> What the islanders are waiting for is offshore oil.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="56"> Successful exploration has been carried out in nearby Argentine waters.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="57"> A seismic survey to the south is almost complete.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="59"> Mr Sampson says even getting as far as exploration would bring a dramatic boost in population.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="60"> Oil could transform the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT931-932" num="61"> But people are in two minds about the prospect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="16"> [Text] Seven words uttered by British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd produced a smile on the face of his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di Tella.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="17"> Hurd said: "We could possibly agree on broad cooperation" on the oil exploration the Kelpers want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters surrounding the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="18"> British sources told CLARIN on 12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting last week in London.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="19"> As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new basis for the position the British will champion late this month or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="20"> Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands despite Argentine protests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="21"> Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which ideally represented exchanging information.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="22"> British sources announced that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means that London "is willing to accept the participation of Argentine companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="23"> A similar message was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="24"> Nevertheless, this is not the final British position.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="25"> Hurd will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="26"> The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate with Argentina "if necessary" and are moving ahead -- full steam -- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required legal or tax framework.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="27"> Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are closely linked to the sovereignty conflict.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="28"> Argentina wants to collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is oil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="29"> Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession, recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="30"> YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that Acenolaza based himself "on outdated information" and that YPF is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the Malvinas Islands last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="31"> Official sources confirmed to CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="32"> The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="33"> Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive seismic reports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-11107" num="34"> The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="7"> BRITAIN AND Argentina have reached a new agreement on sharing fish resources in the South Atlantic and waters surrounding the Falkland islands after two days of talks in Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="8"> The one-year arrangement favours Argentina, which will increase its share of a substantially extended fishing effort next year - raising its catch of the prized illex squid by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="9"> The Falklands will retain its present quota of 150,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="10"> The agreement is to be signed in London early next month during an official visit by Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, in which Argentina's claims to the islands will inevitably feature prominently on the agenda.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="11"> The accord will increase pressure on the islands' financial revenues, which depend heavily on the sale of fishing licences.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="12"> The islands' government forecasts a 35 per cent fall in licence revenue next year to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 15.5m.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="13"> Argentine negotiators say, however, that 'the islands could not delude themselves that we would never develop our fishing industry.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="14"> This agreement allows them to plan ahead'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="15"> Argentina is likely to continue increasing its share of the catch in future years.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="16"> Britain had hoped to strike a long-term agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13429" num="17"> But Argentina is tying such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and the lifting of the UK's arms embargo, imposed during the 1982 Falklands conflict.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="6"> A British soldier recently discovered he had been in Port Stanley, capital of the Falkland Islands, only after he had driven through it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="7"> Turning to his passenger, who was also his commanding officer, he commented on the 'village' they had just passed and, as they motored on into the countryside, wondered when they would see Stanley.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="8"> Indeed, at a glance, it is difficult to understand what all the fuss was about.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="9"> The islands - that saw an Argentine invasion and subsequent death of more than 1,000 soldiers ten years ago - still look not much different from a scattering of Scottish isles.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="10"> Stark and windswept, they loom out of the south Atlantic like a geological afterthought.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="11"> Stanley, where most of the Falklands population of 2,100 is concentrated, has fewer facilities than many smallish European villages: primitively built houses, a single bank and the Upland Goose, which represents the capital's claim to an international hotel but in reality is little more than a glamorised pub.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="12"> It keeps its clients entertained with nightly videos and a one-page summary of world news.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="13"> Newspapers arrive several days late.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="14"> It says much for the abandoned condition of the British colony before the war that the present-day Falklands boasts of economic progress: a new fully equipped hospital and school, a new telephone and road system linking some previously isolated areas, and a new military airport that can be used by wide-bodied jets.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="15"> No British government, having lost lives to retain the islands, could afford to let them sink into oblivion.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="16"> Between 1982 and 1987, the kelpers, as the islanders call themselves, found it easy to get subsidies for their business projects: Pounds 30m was channelled from London into the civilian sector and Pounds 3bn was earmarked in defence spending.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="17"> The programme proved controversial because of some ill-judged investments in projects which in different political circumstances might have been subjected to more careful scrutiny.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="18"> The Falklands programme has since been streamlined and subjected to more control.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="19"> As the governor of the islands, Mr William Fullerton, says, the economy has entered a 'consolidation phase'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="20"> The real change in the Falklands' economic fortunes has come about thanks to the discovery of squid in the South Atlantic and the granting of fishing licences by the local government to foreign companies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="21"> The licences now account for 65 per cent of the islands' operating revenue, even though this is still only a third of what the British Ministry of Defence pays out to maintain its troops on the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="22"> Thanks to squid, the islands are more self-sufficient than they used to be and less dependent on their traditional wool industry, which over the years suffered because of weak world demand.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="23"> The new sense of confidence is personified by Mr Terry Betts.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="24"> In 1982 he was an employee of the Falkland Islands Company, which virtually controlled the local economy but whose substantial landholdings have been broken up and distributed with government assistance to Falklands residents.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="25"> Its Stanley holdings, including the Upland Goose, are up for sale.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="26"> Today, Mr Betts and his wife run their own businesses, including several smaller retailing outlets, and have taken shareholdings in some of the foreign companies which have obtained licences.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="27"> 'We've moved from living within a colonial glove,' he said, 'to having a sense of our own identity.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="28"> What matters to me is success and economic growth'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="29"> The problem for the Falklands is where to go next.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="30"> Officials believe the islands' licensing regime has reached its maximum potential, balancing the need to increase revenue and the need to conserve stocks on which future revenue depends.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="31"> In fact, licensing revenue has fallen to Pounds 25m from its peak of Pounds 28m in the 1988-89 season because of more stringent conservation and competition from other fishing areas.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="32"> One option being considered by the government is broadening the scope of the islands' economic involvement in the fishing industry through development of onshore facilities and a more carefully scrutinised programme of joint ventures.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="33"> Few kelpers have any direct stake in what is actually fished in their waters, while support facilities are based in the Chilean port of Punta Arenas.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="34"> There is also growing local interest in the prospect of developing oil resources.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="35"> London has authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="36"> At the same time it has embarked on talks with Argentina - at which island officials have been present - with a view eventually to discussing issues such as harmonisation of legislation, enviromental policies and demarcation of zones.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="37"> No conclusive survey has ever been done in and around the islands, although the offshore seabed has long been rumoured to hold large oil reserves.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2097" num="38"> However, any serious oil development in the islands could well provoke considerable environmental and political problems and thereby revive the issue of sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="14"> BFN [Text] According to a DYN news agency dispatch, the Argentine and UK Governments will begin negotiations on possible "offshore" oil exploitation around the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="15"> A special commission has been charged with conducting the talks, which will start on 1 July.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="16"> Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella will head the Argentine mission.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="17"> In an interview with DYN, Foreign Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros asserted that "we have agreed to sit down at the negotiating table, to see how we can avoid having future oil exploitation affect the interests of the parties involved".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="18"> He thus alluded to the Argentine-UK controversy over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="19"> Cisneros pointed out that in the course of the talks "Argentina will use all the legal and political resources it has at its disposal to claim its rights before the governments and companies interested in tapping oil in the area".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="20"> Around the end of the year, or at the beginning of 1995, the British Government allegedly intends to license several offshore ventures for hydrocarbons prospecting in the area near the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="21"> This move is reportedly based on prior studies claiming that the area could be rich in oil and gas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="22"> A report drafted and published by the British Geological Survey -- consultants for the Malvinas' British authorities -- argues that recent seismic studies over an area extending 200 square km around the Malvinas Islands revealed the existence of sedimentary basins comparable to the North Sea oil fields (which belong to the United Kingdom).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="23"> The Argentine Government questions the real perspectives for a feasible exploitation of these resources from an economic standpoint.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="24"> It has even expressed certain reservations about the interest international companies allegedly have in participating in oil prospecting in the area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="25"> The executive branch is nevertheless getting ready to tackle a round of negotiations with the British Government to be held in London and in Buenos Aires, as was decided last year by the High Level Group in charge of conducting bilateral economic and political negotiations under the so-called diplomatic umbrella agreed upon by both parties in 1990, which leaves out the question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="26"> Cisneros conceded that "Great Britain continues to show hostility toward Argentina in international forums.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="27"> The islanders refuse to establish any kind of trade with the only neighbor they have in the world, and react to it as if it were an uncouth and hostile country even though 12 years have already elapsed since the war".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-34579" num="28"> Cisneros concluded by ruling out the possibility that the United Kingdom might decide to go ahead in the development of an oil prospecting scheme in the Malvinas islands without having reached prior agreement with Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14936" num="8"> President Carlos Menem cancelled plans to attend a military parade, apparently for fear of being jeered by pro-military right wingers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14936" num="9"> He chose to attend Mass at the national shrine of Lujan.</s>

<s docid="FT922-14936" num="13"> The only military parade was held in the Patagonian city of Ro Gallegos, 2,100 km south of Buenos Aires and on the same latitude as Port Stanley, the Falklands capital.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="16"> [Text] The Argentine Government was able to obtain the results of seismic studies made around the Malvinas Islands, which is the first step in the search for oil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="17"> The results were obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy the maps.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="18"> According to a top source in the Malvinas government, YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million for the seismic maps.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="19"> Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing the Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="20"> Argentina reacted by sending "letters of discomfort" [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them that any activities carried out in the waters around the Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal conflict in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="21"> Without taking the threat into account, the island's government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko Prakla (U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="22"> company) and Spectrum (British), which put the study results up for sale late last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="23"> This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the island's government that the first oil company interested in buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="24"> This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of investigation into operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="25"> Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that side.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="26"> The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="27"> But they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a telephone not listed in the Houston directory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="28"> Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps, according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="29"> The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey result's sale.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="30"> There are no secrets on the island.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="31"> A kelper said: "It is the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if there is something wrong with your stomach".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="32"> This is why the news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="33"> Adviser Wendy Teggart said: "It is a rumor but it seems that YPF bought the seismic studies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="34"> But she immediately said it was true by adding: "It is better for us because if YPF decides to buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="35"> When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the process on those terms because no oil company would risk millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="36"> The island's government members who were asked by this daily said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a juridical dispute.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="37"> They said the first proof that business is more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that the first company that bought the seismic studies was Argentina's YPF.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="38"> At any rate, they said, this information will help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or early April in Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="39"> The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and the kelpers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="40"> This is what the government has been saying since the British went ahead with the seismic survey without consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less costly step of the process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="41"> The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain through probes was "optimistic".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="42"> The survey said there may be oil in the islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="43"> And the only way to prove it is to go ahead with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="44"> Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration and exploitation licenses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="45"> What happens is that because of the investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20 or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="46"> The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the possibility of finding oil in the islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="47"> Their main concern is that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style of their small community.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="48"> To answer this type of question, the islands government has recently contracted the services of the company Environment Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have on the islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="49"> It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known oil tax expert.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="50"> The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina is not yet in the kelpers' plans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-33035" num="51"> The only thing they are sure of is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="15"> [Report by Daniel Santoro]</s>
</F>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="16"> [Text] Reliable Foreign Ministry sources told CLARIN yesterday that, during May, Argentina and Great Britain will resume negotiations on the possibility of some form of cooperation for oil exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas Island coastal waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="17"> The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the process at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's approval.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="18"> The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been frozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting in London on 3 March.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="19"> Negotiations will be carried out within the so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been inactive since negotiations failed in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="20"> Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London this coming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March despite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="21"> His haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that the meeting was going to take place before this month, but he still did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3 March.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="22"> Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through diplomatic channels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which must be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a basis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results at the key meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="23"> One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty that is being kept under the framework of the so-called protective "umbrella" -- is to define the reaches of the term cooperation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="24"> -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great Britain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of information and the willingness to act jointly to protect the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="25"> -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes participation in oil exploration and exploitation within the area controlled by the British.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="26"> During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is indirectly related to the Malvinas Islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="27"> He mentioned to Hurd "Argentina's concern" over Great Britain's increasing political and military relations with Chile.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="28"> The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit future Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make to London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Chile, among other things.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="29"> Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was named minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the British Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="30"> Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge between Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested in good relations between the two Latin American countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="31"> The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's central topic: Oil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="32"> Di Tella knows that the issue will be essential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="33"> The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to begin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year, if negotiations in May fail.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="34"> This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking of discussing the issue with U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="35"> Vice President Al Gore when he visits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced on 2 March.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="36"> What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is that Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all "off-shore" drilling, due to their negative effects on the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-10551" num="37"> In any case, to play the North American game now seems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation will not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19947" num="13"> Article Type:BFN [Text] Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Argentina clashed over the disputed Falkland Islands in a parliamentary forum here Thursday [24 March], with the Argentinian Senate leader calling on Britain to resume negotiations on sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19947" num="14"> "This claim aims at putting an end to the anachronistic colonial situation upheld by Great Britain on a portion of Argentinian territory, in an open violation of the fundamental principles of international law," Eduardo Menem told the Interparliamentary Union [IPU].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19947" num="15"> "The unilateral decisions made by the United Kingdom as regards oil in the Malvinas Islands (the Argentinian name for the disputed islands) and the extension of its alleged jurisdiction around South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, prove the British lack of disposition to start effective negotiations with Argentina," said Menem, brother of Argentinian President Carlos Menem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-19947" num="16"> But Lord David Montgomery criticised Menem for raising the issue, saying "bilateral mechanisms are already in place to continue discussions on all subjects.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="6"> ARGENTINA is obsessed with the Falkland Islands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="7"> Eleven years after its defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="8"> In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="9"> He claims his policy of rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="10"> Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="11"> In the world of diplomacy one needs great patience.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="12"> There is no possibility of taking this conflict over the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="13"> His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="14"> Stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="15"> Eventually, London will have sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="16"> Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="17"> But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in bilateral relations.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="18"> Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="19"> In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve fisheries.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="20"> Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in on the main source of revenue.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="21"> Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="22"> London has remained unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply any recognition of its claim to the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="23"> The UK foreign office says this policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000 inhabitants agree to a change in their status.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="24"> Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which Argentina also claims.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="25"> Oil is emerging as another source of friction.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="26"> The Falklands are believed to have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a joint oil regime.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="27"> London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around the islands.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="28"> Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="29"> There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine attitudes.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="30"> Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain fresh.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="31"> And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="32"> London has also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6577" num="33"> However, talks are planned later this year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military academies.</s>
