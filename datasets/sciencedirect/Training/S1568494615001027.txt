@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Image segmentation is a very significant process in image analysis. Much effort based on thresholding has been made on this field as it is simple and intuitive, commonly used thresholding approaches are to optimize a criterion such as between-class variance or entropy for seeking appropriate threshold values. However, a mass of computational cost is needed and efficiency is broken down as an exhaustive search is utilized for finding the optimal thresholds, which results in application of evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence to obtain the optimal thresholds. This paper considers image thresholding as a constrained optimization problem and optimal thresholds for 1-level or multi-level thresholding in an image are acquired by maximizing the fuzzy entropy via a newly proposed bat algorithm. The optimal thresholding is achieved through the convergence of bat algorithm. The proposed method has been tested on some natural and infrared images. The results are compared with the fuzzy entropy based methods that are optimized by artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO); moreover, they are also compared with thresholding methods based on criteria of between-class variance and Kapur's entropy optimized by bat algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is robust, adaptive, encouraging on the score of CPU time and exhibits the better performance than other methods involved in the paper in terms of objective function values.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image segmentation is an advancing research field in computer vision, the result of which is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image. Each of the pixels in a region is similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property, such as color, intensity, or texture. The goal of segmentation is to simplify or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Over the years much work has been made in this field. For instance, [1] presented an automatic seeded region growing algorithm and merged similar or small regions for color image segmentation. [2,3] respectively used Sobel and Roberts operators, and then grouped edge pixels into contours or surfaces part that represented the boundaries part of the image. All of the above methods could complete the task of image segmentation. However, it is not stable and robust; in addition, it is difficult to obtain the optimal segmentation results. [4] designed an adaptive segmentation system for color document image analysis, which was based on the serialization of k-means algorithm that was applied sequentially by using a sliding window over the image. But it was sensitive to the isolated noise points and usually plunged into local minimum. [5] proposed a weighted image patch-based FCM (WIPFCM) algorithm for image segmentation, which incorporated local spatial information embedded in the image into the segmentation process. However, the required storage space of this method may significantly increase, which will cause a huge amount of computation and low operating efficiency for the whole algorithm. [6] presented a new method for color image segmentation, which divided the image into homogeneous areas by local thresholds. In general, the currently used image segmentation method may be summarized as four main categories: region-based method, boundary-based method, clustering-based method, and thresholding-based method. Owing to its intuitive properties and simplicity of implementation, thresholding method holds a primary position in the field of image segmentation [7,8].A lot of endeavour has been done on the topic of image thresholding and many thresholding methods have been put forward. For example, [9] provided the classical thresholding method on the criterion of between-class variance for image segmentation. [10] presented a general technique for thresholding of digital images based on Renyi's entropy. [11] utilized particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) combined with Kapur's entropy and between-class variance to find the optimal multi-level thresholds. [12] adopted a novel thresholding technique via proposing an energy function to generate the energy curve of an image and taking into an account the spatial contextual information of the image. Because of the fuzziness of real life image, recently image segmentation methods based on fuzzy theory have attracted much attention which could obtain satisfactory segmentation results. [13] gave a definition of the concept ‘intuitionistic fuzzy set’ (IFS), the latter being a generalization of the concept ‘fuzzy set’ and an example was described. [14] introduced a new nonprobabilistic entropy measure in the context of fuzzy sets or messages. [15] recalled the definitions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets with the relation between these sets established by [13], which defined the distance measure between intuitionistic fuzzy sets and gave an axiom definition of intuitionistic fuzzy entropy on this basis.Fuzzy sets play a significant role in many deployed systems by virtue of their capability to model nonstatistical imprecision [16]. Fuzzy entropy is a function on fuzzy sets that becomes smaller when the sharpness of its argument fuzzy set is improved. The notion of entropy, in the theory of fuzzy sets, was first introduced by [17]. There have been numerous applications of fuzzy entropies in image segmentation. Such as [18] proposed fuzzy homogeneity vectors to handle the grayness and spatial uncertainties among pixels, and to perform multilevel thresholding. [19] presented a thresholding approach by performing fuzzy partition on a two-dimensional histogram based on the fuzzy relation and the maximum fuzzy entropy principle. [20] considered the fuzzy memberships as an indication of how strongly a gray value belonged to the background or to the foreground. The optimum threshold was found as the threshold that minimized the sum of the fuzzy entropies.[21] presented an entropy function by the fuzzy c-partition (FP) and the probability partition (PP) which was used to measure the compatibility between the PP and the FP. By adopting a simple monotonic function to approximate the memberships of the bright, the dark and the medium, it derived a necessary condition for the entropy function to be maximized, pd=pm=pb=1/3, and deduced an algorithm for three-level thresholding. The image is partitioned into three parts, namely the dark, dust and bright. However, the whole process needs a great deal of computation and efficiency is reduced. Therefore, in recent years, some modified methods using evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence optimization algorithms blending of fuzzy entropy have been put forward to further improve efficiency of fuzzy entropy based image thresholding.Evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence are two similar subfields of artificial intelligence that involve continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems, which have been previously employed to perform entropy-based image segmentation. [22] proposed a new multi-level maximum entropy thresholding (MET) approach based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. [23,24] implemented genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal combination of the fuzzy parameters for fuzzy entropy based image segmentation. [25] introduced particle swarm optimization (PSO) into fuzzy entropy to meet the needs of the segmentation application. [26] investigated the performance of the fuzzy entropy approach application to the segmentation and ant colony optimization (ACO) was used to obtain the optimal parameters. Bat algorithm (BA) is a newly proposed stochastic global search algorithm, which has excellent performance on handing with optimization problem. [27] has made a conceptual comparison of BA, PSO and GA. The final results indicate that BA could converge to the optimal solution stably. Nowadays, BA has been widely used in diverse applications, e.g. [28] utilized BA to solve the brushless DC wheel motor problems. [29] intended to explore capabilities and potentials of BA in the realm of structural optimization. [30] used BA for discrete size optimization of steel frames. In the field of image processing, [31] have employed BA for image matching. [32,33] have tried to employ BA for image thresholding based on Kapur's entropy and realized fair good segmentation results. Further, there are some variants and modifications of BA, such as [34] proposed a binary BA and used it for optical buffer design. Douglas [35] applied a binary BA for feature selection. [36] proposed a self-adaptive BA that borrowed the self-adapting mechanism from self-adapted differential evolution, which performed better than the standard BA. However, the standard BA is by far the most popularly used. Hence, in this paper, a novel image segmentation technique is proposed using fuzzy entropy and blending of standard BA.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 makes a general description for the theory of maximum fuzzy entropy based image thresholding. Section 3 describes the basic theory of bat algorithm (BA) in brief. Section 4 presents the fundamental viewpoint of BA-based fuzzy entropy method. In Section 5, simulation results and discussion are displayed. Finally, conclusions will be drawn in Section 6.Let D={(i, j):i=0, 1, …, M−1;j=0, 1, …, N−1} and G={0, 1, …, L−1}, where M, N and L are three positive integers standing for width, height and maximum gray-scale of an image. Let I(x, y) be the gray level value of the image at the pixel (x, y) and Dk={(x, y):I(x, y)=k, (x, y)=D}, k=0, 1, …, L−1. Supposed that t1 and t2 are used as the thresholds, which divide the domain D of the original image into 3 parts, Ed, Emand Eb. Edis composed of pixels with low gray levels, Emconsists of pixels with middle gray levels, and Ebis made up of pixels with high gray levels. Π3={Ed,Em,Eb} is an unknown probabilistic partition of D, its probability distribution can be expressed as [21](1)pd=P(Ed)pm=P(Em)pb=P(Eb)The membership functions is utilized (see Fig. 1) to approximate the memberships of the dark μd, the dust μmand the bright μbof an image with 28 gray levels. There are 6 parameters a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 in membership function. That is to say, the thresholds t1 and t2 are dependent on the parameters of the membership functions [26]. For each k=0,1,…,255, let(2)Dd={(x,y):I(x,y)≤t1,(x,y)∈Dk}Dm={(x,y):t1<I(x,y)≤t2,(x,y)∈Dk}Db={(x,y):I(x,y)>t2,(x,y)∈Dk}Then, we have Eq. (3) as below:(3)pkd=P(Dd)=pk*pd|kpkm=P(Dm)=pk*pm|kpkb=P(Db)=pk*pb|kIt is claimed that pd|k, pm|kand pb|kare the conditional probability of a pixel that is partitioned into the class dark, dust and bright, respectively, under the circumstance that the pixel pertains to Dkwith pd|k+pm|k+pb|k=1 (k=0,1,…,255). Let the grade of pixels with gray level value of k belong to the class dark, dust and bright be equivalent to its conditional probability pd|k, pm|k, pb|krespectively. Then the following equations will hold as:(4)pd=∑k=0255pk*pd|k=∑k=0255pk*μd(k)pm=∑k=0255pk*pm|k=∑k=0255pk*μm(k)pb=∑k=0255pk*pb|k=∑k=0255pk*μb(k)The 3 membership functions have been exhibited in Fig. 1. We respectively select the Z(k, a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2)-function and U(k, a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2) – function as the membership function μd(k) and μm(k) of the class dark and dust, and choose the S(k, a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2)-function as the membership function μb(k) of the class bright. We could write 3 membership functions as:(5)μd(k)=1k≤a11−(k−a1)2(c1−a1)*(b1−a1)a1<k≤b1(k−c1)2(c1−a1)*(c1−b1)b1<k≤c10k>c1(6)μm(k)=0k≤a1(k−a1)2(c1−a1)*(b1−a1)a1<k≤b11−(k−c1)2(c1−a1)*(c1−b1)b1<k≤c11c1<k≤a21−(k−a2)2(c2−a2)*(b2−a2)a2<k≤b2(k−c2)2(c2−a2)*(c2−b2)b2<k≤c20k>c2(7)μb(k)=0k≤a2(k−a2)2(c2−a2)*(b2−a2)a2<k≤b21−(k−c2)2(c2−a2)*(c2−b2)b2<k≤c21k>c2These 6 parameters a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 should meet the condition 0≤a1<b1<c1<a2<b2<c2≤255. Then, the fuzzy entropy function of each class could be given as [26]:(8)Hd=−∑k=0255pk*μd(k)pd*In(pk*μd(k)pd)Hm=−∑k=0255pk*μm(k)pm*In(pk*μm(k)pm)Hb=−∑k=0255pk*μb(k)pb*In(pk*μb(k)pb)The whole fuzzy entropy is calculated through summarizing fuzzy entropy of each class i.e.(9)H(a1,b1,c1,a2,b2,c2)=Hd+Hm+HbThe whole fuzzy entropy varies along with the 6 variables a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2. We could seek a optimal combination of a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 so that the whole fuzzy entropy H(a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2) reach the maximum value. In this way, the most applicable threshold to partition the image into 3 classes could be computed as following:(10)μd(t1)=μm(t1)=0.5μm(t2)=μb(t2)=0.5As is shown in Fig. 1, threshold t1 and t2 are the point of intersection of μd(k), μm(k) and μb(k) curve. Based on Eqs. (5)–(7), the solution can be accomplished as:t1=a1+(c1−a1)*(b1−a1)/2(a1+c1)/2≤b1≤c1c1−(c1−a1)*(c1−b1)/2a1≤b1≤(a1+c1)/2t2=a2+(c2−a2)*(b2−a2)/2(a2+c2)/2≤b2≤c2c2−(c2−a2)*(c2−b2)/2a2≤b2≤(a2+c2)/2According to the different needs, the proposed throsholding method can be expended to more than two thresholds or decreased to a single threshold. It is worth noting that a threshold value is indicated by 3 parameters, and two threshold values are indicated by 6 parameters for maximum fuzzy entropy based thresholding, which leads to a heavy workload for this method. As a result, it needs to be improved from the point of implementation efficiency, and details will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5.Nowadays, swarm intelligence algorithms are becoming powerful methods for solving many tough optimization problems. These algorithms make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large space of candidate solutions. The vast majority of heuristic and swarm intelligence algorithms have been derived from the behaviors of biological systems and/or physical systems in nature, such as genetic algorithm [37], particle swarm optimization [38], ant colony optimization algorithm [39], artificial bee colony algorithm [40] and simulated annealing [41] etc., these algorithms have been successfully employed to deal with many combinatorial optimization and continuous optimization problems. Micro-bats use a type of sonar, called echolocation, their behaviors of detecting prey, avoiding obstacles and locating roosting crevices have been one of the most interesting research areas in artificial intelligence. In 2010, Yang has developed a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm-bat-inspired algorithm through simulating this fascinating behavior of bat [27], which combines major advantages of simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization.Bat algorithm is based on the echo ranging behaviors of bats which uses virtual bats to deal with practical problem. For simplicity, the following idealized rules are defined by [27]:•All bats utilize echo ranging to measure distance, and the difference between prey and background barriers are known by their own in some magical way.Bats move randomly with velocityviat position xi, moreover each bat has a settled frequency fminvarying wavelength λ and loudness A0 to prey. They could intelligently correct the wavelength (or frequency) of their emitted pulses; in addition, bats are able to change the pulse emission rate r∈[0,1] according to the proximity of targets.It is granted that the loudness change from a large positive constant value A0 to a minimum constant value Amin, though the loudness can change with a variety of ways.In general, it is supposed that f∈[0,fmax] as a supplement to above assumptions; moreover, the typical ranges are a few meters for bats. Thus, the rate of pulse can simply be in the range of [0,1] where 0 denotes no pulses at all, and 1 denotes the maximum rate of pulse emission.To handle with practical problem, the virtual bats are used and the rules that update new solutions xitand velocitiesvitat step t in a multi-dimensional search space are defined by following equations.(11)fi=fmin+(fmax−fmin)β(12)vit=vit−1+(xit−1−x*)fi(13)xit=xit−1+vitwhere β∈[0,1] is a uniformly generated random vector. Herevitandvit−1are the velocity vectors of the ith micro-bat at iterations t and t−1 respectively; likewise xitand xit−1are the position vectors of the micro-bat at iterations t and t−1 respectively, and x* is the current global optimal location (solution) which is located after making a comparison of all solutions produced by n bats. The frequency fican be used to adjust the velocity change, according to the form of the problem of interest. In the initial state, the frequency of each bat is randomly drawn in the range of [fminfmax].In the part of local search, after comparing solutions of all bats, the optimal solution could be detected, which is marked as the current best solutions, then a new solution may be generated locally using random walk:(14)xnew=xold+ϵAtwhere ϵ∈[0,1] is a random number subject to Gaussian distribution, xnewis the new solution, xoldis the solution which is obtained by Eq. (13), while the average loudness of all the bats are represented by At= <Ait>at this step.Further, it needs to update the loudness Aiand the rate riof pulse emission accordingly along with the iterations. Once the prey is found by a bat, the loudness usually decreases and the rate of pulse emission correspondingly increases, we could set the loudness as any value of convenience. For instance, here A0=1 and Amin=0, supposing Amin=0 denotes that the prey is just found by a bat or temporarily the bat will stop emitting.(15)Ait+1=αAit,rit+1=ri0[1−exp(−γt)]where α and γ are constants. As the matter of fact, α resembles the cooling factor of a cooling schedule in the simulated annealing. For any α and γ in the range of 0<α<1 and γ>0, we have(16)Ait→0,rit→ri0,ast→∞Generally, α is set equal to γ. In the initial state, each bat will be set with different values of loudness and pulse emission rate, and this can be achieved by random selection. When the new solutions are improved, their loudness and emission rates will correspondingly update, which signifies that the optimal solution is close to these bats.In this section, an efficient method to find the optimal thresholds for image segmentation is introduced, which is developed to maximize the fuzzy entropy by using standard BA. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. Specific procedures of our algorithm are presented as follows:Algorithm 1Algorithm: BA-based fuzzy entropy methodInput: The set of position vectors xi(i=1,2,…,n) as the parameters a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2. Initialize velocity vectors vi, pulse rates riand the loudness Ai. Define pulse frequency fiat xi.

(9);11: if rand < Aiand H(xi) < H(x*)then12: Accept the new solution;13: Increase riand reduce Ai;14: end if15: Rank the bats and find the current best x*;16: end while17: Record x* as a non-dominated solution;18: return The optimal solution and the corresponding segmented image with selected thresholds.According to the operational process of swarm intelligence algorithm, the computational results of BA depend on parameters setting in some extent, fine tuning of the parameters setting can produce a better result. Table 1shows the parameters used in the proposed method.We implement the proposed algorithm by the language of Matlab 2014a on a personal computer with a 3.20 GHz CPU, 2.00G RAM under Windows 7 system.In order to show the advantages of the proposed method, some natural images and infrared images used for testing. Half of our test images are natural images named “PEPPERS”, “LENA”, “CAMERA”, “GOLDHILL”. Each image has obvious peaks and valleys in histogram, with proper thresholds, the classes after segmentation could be easily seen. The remaining are infrared images named “TANK”, “PERSON”, “PLANE”, “SHIP” for the reason that infrared sensors have good night vision performance and are widely applied in automatic target recognition. Infrared images reflect the thermal radiations of the targets and the background, and the objects can be distinguished by their gray levels.As well as some of the commonly used evolutionary algorithm or swarm intelligence based thresholding methods are also carried out in the paper. As is illustrated in Section 2, standard BA is used here. Although there are many variants of GA, PSO, ACO and ABC, in order to make a fair comparison, GA, PSO, ACO, ABC are all used with their standard algorithms. To make a fair comparison, the number of function evaluations are used as terminal criterion; that is, all algorithms will stop when the number of function evaluations reach 4500. In this section, we present some contrastive experimental results, including illustrative examples and performance evaluating tables, which clearly demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. To make purposeful yet effective comparisons, the selected thresholding methods for comparison are all entropy-based thresholding methods optimized by evolutionary algorithm or swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. They are GA-based fuzzy entropy method (GAFE) [24],  PSO-based fuzzy entropy method (PSOFE) [25], ACO-based fuzzy entropy method (ACOFE) [26], ABC-based fuzzy entropy method (ABCFE) and ABC-based cross entropy method (ABCCE) [22], BA-based Kapur's entropy method (BAKE) [32]. In addition, as is known that Otsu's criterion is one of the most classical thresholding methods; hence, BA-based Otsu's method (BAOT) is also executed in the paper. Here we present 2-level, 3-level, 4-level and 5-level thresholding for visual evaluation of natural images. On the other hand, it is noted that there is only a threshold value needed for thresholding methods except fuzzy entropy based method because there is a single object in the infrared image here. Exhaustive search is good enough to obatin the optimal threshold with high efficiency. Thus, exhaustive search is utilized to realize 1-level thresholding based on Otsu's method, Kapur's entropy method and cross entropy method in this section. All the algorithms are evaluated using the same objective function. Our primary interest is the optimization ability, which is shown by the fitness value of objective function defined as Eq. (9), and the accuracy of object segmentation which is evaluated by PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for natural images and absolute error ratio for infrared images.Tables 2–5show the parameters setting of GA, PSO, ACO and ABC algorithm.In order to obtain the consistent comparisons, a popular performance indicator, PSNR, is used to compare the segmentation results by using the multilevel image threshold techniques. For the sake of completeness we define PSNR, measured in decibel (dB) as [42].(17)PSNR=10log102552MAEwhere MAE is the mean absolute error, formulated as:(18)MAE=∑i=1M∑j=1N|I(i,j)−K(i,j)|M*NHere I(i, j) and K(i, j) are original and segmented images of size M*N, respectively.On the other hand, for infrared images, we use the absolute error ratio as the main measuring criterion. The absolute error ratio is defined by [26] as the ratio between the absolute error, ndiff, and N is the total pixels number of the test image, i.e.,(19)rerr=ndiffN*100%The absolute error ndiffis defined as the absolute difference in the number of object pixels between the optimally thresholding image and the thresholding image acquired by each method. The optimally thresholding images and the corresponding threshold values are manually fulfilled with the help of visual inspection [26].The proposed method and the contemporary methods are illustrated using four natural images which are given in Figs. 2–5respectively. The original images and corresponding histograms are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5(a) and (b). The segmented images which are adopted by 2-level thresholding, 3-level thresholding, 4-level thresholding and 5-level thresholding are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5(c)–(r) respectively.These figures show the effect of BA-based fuzzy entropy method. As an example, the output image with 5-level thresholding of Lena using the proposed method shown in Fig. 2(j) looks like qualitatively better than the 5-level thresholding image with ABCCE shown in Fig. 2(f). In the same way, all other images shown in the paper manifest that thresholding images acquired with the proposed method appear qualitatively superior to images acquired with other methods like BA-based Otsu's method, BA-based Kapur's entropy method and ABC-based cross entropy method. From Figs. 2–5, as the incensement of thresholding level, it is also discovered that the thresholding images rapidly tend the original images from the visual point of view. For instance, let's look over the histogram image of Fig. 3(b), it is multimodal in essence. As a result, the segmented result with 5-level thresholding shown in Fig. 3(r) looks like better than the 2-level thresholding shown in Fig. 3(o). In addition, all other images are also analogous to this situation.Concerning infrared images, four images given in Figs. 6–9are used to contrast segmented effects of the proposed method and the contemporary methods. The original images and corresponding histograms are shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9(a) and (b). The segmented image through manually thresholding, Otsu's method, Kapur's entropy method, cross entropy method and proposed method are given in Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9(c)–(h), respectively.With respect to infrared images, our method is able to provide very good segmented results. In Fig. 7(b)–(d), the object in the TANK image is not distinctly separated by using Otsu's method, Kapur's entropy and cross entropy. With the proposed method, the object is distinctly differentiated from the background. Similarly in Figs. 8 and 9 (the PERSON and PLANE image) objects are mixed with the background by means of Otsu's criterion, Kapur's entropy and cross entropy method. While using the proposed method, the objects in images of PERSON and PLANE become clearly identifiable. Further, for SHIP image in Fig. 10(a)–(e), only the proposed method can explicitly identify the object and avoid to be disturbed by noise. In all, the proposed approach can effectively extract the infrared object from the background and the performance is the closest to the optimum one obtained by manually throsholding. The experiment shows that BA-based fuzzy entropy method provides best thresholding performance among all methods being compared.For evaluating the performance of the proposed BA-based fuzzy entropy method quantitatively, numerical illustrations are PRESENTED with various evaluation criteria such as fitness values, optimal threshold values, PSNR (in dB), absolute error ratio (in %) and CPU time (in seconds). A higher fitness value indicates better optimization ability, a higher PSNR value or a lower absolute error ratio indicates better segmentation result.For four natural images, Table 6shows the selected thresholds with fuzzy entropy thresholding method optimized by different algorithms. Tables 7 and 8show the corresponding PSNR values and fitness values of four natural images. It displays in Table 6 that the selected thresholds of BA-based fuzzy entropy method are not identical with that of GA-based fuzzy entropy method, PSO-based fuzzy entropy method, ACO-based fuzzy entropy method and ABC-based fuzzy entropy method. Moreover, as is shown in Table 9, ABC-based cross entropy method, BA-based Kapur's entropy method and BA-based Otsu's method obtain different threshold values with that of the proposed method. As far as the PSNR value and fitness value in Tables 7 and 8, the fitness value of GA-based fuzzy entropy method, PSO-based fuzzy entropy method and ABC-based fuzzy entropy method is distinctly worse than that of ACO-based fuzzy entropy method and the proposed method, and the maximum difference of the average fitness value between them is about 0.5, and the maximum difference of PSNR is more than 0.7. For “CAMERA” image, the fitness value of ACO-based fuzzy entropy method and the proposed method is very similar, the difference of PSNR is about 0.2. Regarding to the whole 4 natural images, the proposed method has better optimization ability than ACO-based fuzzy entropy method. Table 10shows the computation time of all contemporary methods. Evidently, GA-based fuzzy entropy method, ACO-based fuzzy entropy method and ABC-based fuzzy entropy method have a slow convergence speed, the maximum difference of computation time between them is more than 0.8s. It is worth noting that PSO-based fuzzy entropy method has the fastest convergence speed and is slightly quicker than BA-based fuzzy entropy method, that is, the average difference of computation time between PSO-based fuzzy entropy method and BA-based fuzzy entropy method is less than 0.1s. However, the fitness value and PSNR of PSO-based fuzzy entropy method is obviously less than BA-based fuzzy entropy method. In view of the fact that the number of parameters to be optimized is triple the number of threshold values for fuzzy entropy based thresholding method; meanwhile, for other thresholding methods, the number of parameters to be optimized is equal to the number of threshold values; apparently, fuzzy entropy has a more complex calculation process than cross entropy, Kapur's entropy and Otsu's criterion. In consequence, the proposed method has a slower convergence speed than ABC-based cross entropy method, BA-based Kapur's entropy method and BA-based Otsu's method. By contrast, according to the data in Tables 7 and 9, the PSNR value of proposed BA-based fuzzy entropy method is distinctly better than that by adopting ABC-based cross entropy method, BA-based Kapur's entropy method and BA-based Otsu's method, the maximum difference value is more than 3. As a whole, the proposed method can always converge to the optimal thresholds in all methods involved in this paper; what's more, the PSNR and fitness value are all maximum among all the methods when handling with natural images.Tables 11 and 12show the selected threshold, computation time and absolute error ratio of four infrared images. The selected threshold of Otsu's method, cross entropy method and Kapur's entropy method have a big gap comparing with other fuzzy entropy based method, the segmentation accuracy is very low for infrared images with these methods. For another, it is illustrated that the selected threshold of BA-based fuzzy entropy algorithm is close to the ones of GA-based fuzzy entropy method, PSO-based fuzzy entropy method, ACO-based fuzzy entropy method and ABC-based fuzzy entropy method. Moreover, in term of error ratio, the performance of the proposed method is better than other methods, the minimum error ratio of the proposed method is only 0.006%, and the select threshold is also much closer to manually thresholding. Further, in the regard of CPU time, PSO-based fuzzy entropy method has the fastest convergence speed in all contemporary methods, but the fitness value and error ratio of BA-based fuzzy entropy method is obviously better than PSO-based fuzzy entropy method, the maximum difference of error ratio between PSO-based fuzzy entropy method is about 0.6%, the minimum difference is 0.036%. Finally, Table 13shows the corresponding object error pixel and fitness value of four infrared images. It is evident that all the fuzzy entropy based methods could give good results for infrared images, the maximum difference of the fitness value is less than 0.02. Among these methods, BA-based fuzzy entropy method is still superior to the other methods, which could obtain higher fitness value and lower object error ratio, the minimum false object pixel of the proposed method is only 1. In short, the experiment results demonstrate that compared to the methods involved in this paper, the proposed BA-based fuzzy entropy method has the best performance for both natural test images and infrared test images.
