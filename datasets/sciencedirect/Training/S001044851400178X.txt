@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Finite element method (FEM) is commonly used for deformable image registration. However, there is no existing literature studying how the superimposed mesh structure would influence the image registration process. We study this problem in this paper, and propose a dynamic meshing strategy to generate mesh structure for image registration. To construct such a dynamic mesh during image registration, three steps are performed. Firstly, a density field that measures the importance of a pixel/voxel’s displacement to the registration process is computed. Secondly, an efficient contraction–optimization scheme is applied to compute a discrete Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation of the density field. Thirdly, the final mesh structure is constructed by its dual triangulation, with some post-processing to preserve the image boundary. In each iteration of the deformable image registration, the mesh structure is efficiently updated with GPU-based parallel implementation. We conduct experiments of the new dynamic mesh-guided registration framework on both synthetic and real medical images, and compare our results with the other state-of-the-art FEM-based image registration methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Finite element method (FEM) is a widely used technique to solve deformable image registration problems in the computer graphics, computer vision and medical imaging community. By introducing a superimposed mesh structure in the image domain, the speed and accuracy of image registration significantly depends on the mesh structure.The traditional meshing methods usually target at generating a high quality mesh whose boundary resembles the surface of the biological object in one image  [1]. Usually when the node number is fixed, the requirement of better surfaces approximation always implies a deterioration of mesh quality. There are a lot of algorithms  [2–8] proposed to strive for the trade-off between these two conflicting factors.We believe meshing for deformable image registration should focus on the registration process instead of one image (source or target image). Since the registration process is a dynamic process, the mesh structure should be updated accordingly. Three steps are performed in our algorithm for the dynamic mesh generation. Firstly, a density field that measures the importance of a pixel/voxel’s displacement to the registration process is computed. Secondly, an efficient contraction–optimization scheme is applied to compute a discrete Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) of the density field. Thirdly, the final mesh structure is constructed by its dual triangulation, with some post-processing to preserve the image boundary.The main contribution of our work includes two aspects: on the one hand, we propose a mesh generation algorithm based on how the mesh will influence the registration process; on the other hand, we present a parallel algorithm to compute and update the mesh structure efficiently.
