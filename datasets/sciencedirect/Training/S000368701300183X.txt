@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this study was to develop a more efficient (i.e. shortened) protocol for hand function capacity evaluation and to test the agreement of the protocol compared to the original protocol. 643 Healthy subjects performed tests for hand function. Agreement between two shortened protocols was compared with an existing protocol. The original protocol was performed once and the proposed shortened protocol differed in the number of trials which were reduced by statistical elimination. Agreement was determined with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and Limits of Agreement (LoA). Excellent ICCs (≥0.91) were observed in all proposed protocols except for the one trial purdue pegboard test protocol. For all tests of hand function, shorter protocols are valid to determine hand function. For Tip Pinch Strength testing, Palmar Pinch Strength testing and the Purdue Pegboard test, a two-trial protocol is recommended, because the LoA were considerable, which could affect decision-making with regards to hand capacity. For the Hand Grip strength test, the Key Pinch Strength test and the Complete Minnesota Dexterity Test, a one-trial protocol is recommended, because the LoA were acceptable. It was concluded that for healthy subjects, this shorter protocol is a reliable measure. Further testing of the short form hand FCE protocols should be completed on patients with disabling conditions prior to widespread use of these protocols among clinical samples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The evaluation of hand function is of importance in the assessment of upper limb impairments such as complaints of arm, neck and shoulder (CANS), chronic musculoskeletal pain or disabilities as the result of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, developmental disabilities, muscular dystrophy, chronic pain or stroke (Blair et al., 1987; Mitsionis et al., 2009). Due to the importance of hand force in relation to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, evaluation of hand function and work ability has been a research issue among ergonomics researcher (Bao and Silverstein, 2005).Upper extremity work capacity testing can be a part of Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs). FCEs are standardized batteries of tests which all together form an evaluation of the functional capacity of work-related activities (Soer et al., 2008). FCEs can be job specific (Innes, 1999) or pathology specific (Reneman et al., 2005; Gross et al., 2006; Gouttebarge et al., 2010) and they can be used to determine hand function (Reneman et al., 2005; Soer et al., 2006). A pathology specific FCE protocol for patients with work related upper limb disorders, consists of tests which determine Hand Grip strength, finger strength and upper limb dexterity (Soer et al., 2006). Usually these tests consist of multiple repeated trials, but there is discussion about the efficiency and validity (Watanabe et al., 2005), because repeated trials are time consuming, expensive and results may be affected by (muscle) fatigue (Watanabe et al., 2005, Reddon et al., 1985) and/or learning (Watanabe et al., 2005). Reliable and validated FCE protocols that consist of fewer or single trials to assess hand function have not been described. Some authors argue that a more efficient protocol can be developed since protocols that consists of less trials do not seem to affect the validity and reliability of the protocol (Soer et al., 2006; Coldham et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2011).Hand and finger grip strength testing is used to quantify physical exposures of work activities to guide prevention efforts in the management of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Many exposures are difficult to collect in the work environment; therefore grip strength testing in combination with methods such as “force matching” is used by ergonomist in the field. (Bao and Silverstein, 2005; Dale et al., 2011; Wiktorin et al., 1996). It is also being argued that a measure of grip strength is not a true measure of grip strength alone because of the influence of pain and therefore a shorter protocol could lead to a more true measure of Hand Grip strength (Coldham et al., 2006). A less time consuming and demanding protocol could lead to reliable outcomes but that are less physical demanding, for workers with and without history of upper limb pathology (Coldham et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2011). Therefore, a more efficient FCE protocol which consists of fewer trials may also lead to a more valid and reliable evaluation of hand function. Shorter protocols are more beneficial for ergonomists and occupational health specialists who determine hand function for work ability assessments, because it leads to a less time intensive and more cost efficient procedure (Dale et al., 2011). The aim of this study was to develop a more effective, lean and valid protocol to assess hand function. It was hypothesized that a shorter protocol does not affect the validity of hand function capacity testing.
