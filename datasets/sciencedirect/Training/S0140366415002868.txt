What makes us click “like” on Facebook? Examining psychological, technological, and motivational factors on virtual endorsement

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Enjoyment and interpersonal relationship as most salient motives.Those with higher self-esteem, more diligence, more emotional stability, and less subjective norm clicked “like” to express enjoyment.Those with lower self-esteem, less diligence, less emotional stability, and higher subjective norm clicked “like” for pleasing others.Enjoyment, interpersonal relationship, and perceived ease of “like” positively predicted the attitude toward “like.”Subjective norm and the passing time motive positively predicted clicking “like.” The pleasing others motivation negatively predicted “like” behavior.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study examines motives for virtually endorsing others on social media, focusing on the Facebook “like” function. Motives are studied in terms of uses and gratifications, Theory of Reasoned Action, and personality and technology factors. Data from an online survey of 213 respondents were examined using factor- and hierarchical-regression analyses. Findings showed enjoyment and interpersonal relationship as most salient motives. Two types of user profiles emerged. Those with higher self-esteem, more diligence, more emotional stability, and less subjective norm clicked “like” to express enjoyment. Those with lower self-esteem, less diligence, less emotional stability, and higher subjective norm clicked “like” for pleasing others.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A quick and simple click that allows users to virtually endorse content on social network sites (SNSs) – such as the Facebook “like” button — has become ubiquitous across new media platforms. A “like” acts as a form of virtual endorsement to publicly support another user, a brand, or an organization with instantaneous display in virtual communities. Similar one-click endorsement functions happen on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other online platforms. Amassed likes or virtual endorsements offer crowd-sourced support that may positively influence others’ attitudes [1]. The widespread use of “like” may in fact be shifting its meaning toward acknowledgment or agreement, and less about “liking” [2]. However, what a “like” as virtual endorsement means to the user is less known. Factors that motivate use of this technological function are emerging in some studies but remain limited.This study builds on early research about clicking “like” and other endorsement mechanisms. An online survey of 213 respondents was conducted with focus on key variables for using “like” through factor and hierarchical-regression analyses. Motivations were examined with the uses and gratifications (U&G) perspective in virtual communities [3–7]. Motivations, attitudes, and behaviors are explored along with individual differences of personality, self-esteem, social influences, and technology uses.Findings from this work show ways that SNSs and virtual endorsements influence the online social experience. According to Duggan and Smith's 2013 study [8], among U.S. Internet users, 73% engage in social media and 71% use Facebook. eMarketer's 2013 report [9] showed that from mid-2012 to mid-2013, Facebook “likes” increased 37% from PCs, 43% from mobile phones, and 74% from tablets. Facebook “power users” dominate clicking “like,” resulting in users in an average month receiving 20 likes though they only gave 14 [10]. “Liking” a product on Facebook may be connected with a promotional message sent to friend networks [11]. Virtual endorsement also may include typing comments (e.g., commenting on a YouTube video), but one-click mechanisms provide the quickest options for passing along updates (e.g., retweeting a Twitter update) or choosing content to share (e.g., skill endorsements on LinkedIn).This work contributes to initial understanding of virtual endorsement motivations that align with particular attitudes and behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of virtual endorsement on Facebook with extensions to current and future SNSs.
