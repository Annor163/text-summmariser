@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We consider identifying the RTS status of DMUs in Weight-Restricted DEA models.We extend some of the results from our EJOR 2011 paper.Under suitable circumstances Constant Returns to Scale prevail.We also present partial results for another previously unresolved case.Our techniques are based on simple ratio calculations, and not on LP.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This technical note extends the results of our recent paper [Korhonen, Soleimani-damaneh, Wallenius, EJOR 215 (2011) 431–438], for determining the RTS status of Decision Making Units in Weight-Restricted DEA models.Consider a set of n DMUs with input–output vectors (xj,yj); j=1,…,o,…,n, in which xj=(x1j,…,xmj)Tand yj=(y1j,…,ysj)Tare nonzero nonnegative vectors, and define X=[x1,…,xn]m×nand Y=[y1,…,yn]s×n. Assume no duplicate DMUs. We consider the CCR and BCC models, in multiplier form, for evaluating the efficiency of DMUo(xo,yo) with some additional weight restrictions (WRs) as follows:θo=maxuyo-u0,s.t.vxo=1,uY-vX-u0e⩽0,u⩾0,v⩾0,ur-ρrur+1⩽0;r=1,…,s-1,vi-κivi+1⩽0;i=1,…,m-1,u0∈Λ,where ΛCCR={u0:u0=0} andΛBCC={u0:u0∈R}. e is a vector with all components equal to one. Using two invertible matrices Qs×sand Pm×m, Korhonen, Soleimani-damaneh, and Wallenius (2011) converted the above-mentioned model to the following standard multiplier DEA model:θo=maxuˆyˆo-u0s.t.vˆxˆo=1,uˆY^-vˆX^-u0e⩽0,u0∈Λ,uˆ⩾0,vˆ⩾0,in whichuˆ=uQ,vˆ=vP,Yˆ=Q-1Y, andXˆ=P-1X; see also Foroughi and Tamiz (2005). Considering DMUo, in Korhonen et al. (2011), we defined(1)αjo=maxryˆroyˆrj:yˆro+yˆrj>0,j=1,2,…,n,(2)βjo=maxixˆijxˆio:xˆio+xˆij>0·αjo,j=1,2,…,n.There are four possible cases for set Ao={k:βko=minj{βjo}}, as follows:(i)αko>1 for each k∈Ao,αko<1 for each k∈Ao,αko>1 for some k∈Aoandαk′o<1for some k′∈Ao,αko=1 for some k∈Ao.In Korhonen et al. (2011), we proved that, if case (i) (respectively case (ii)) occurs, then DRS (respectively IRS) prevail at (xo,yo); however, we were unable to conclude the RTS status of DMUoin case of (iii) or (iv). In Theorem 1 we prove that CRS prevail when case (iii) occurs, however, all three situations CRS, IRS or DRS are possible in case (iv). DMUois a BCC-WR-efficient unit in the whole paper.Theorem 1Suppose that αko>1 for some k∈Aoandαk′o<1for some k′∈Ao. Then CRS prevail at (xo,yo).Since k∈Ao, by (1) and (2), we get βko=minj{βjo}⩽βoo=1. By (1),αkoyˆk⩾yˆo. Also, by (2),αkoxˆk⩽βkoxˆo. Let(uˆ,vˆ,u0)be an arbitrary optimal solution to multiplier BCC model. Thenuˆyˆk-vˆxˆk-u0⩽0. By the last three inequalities, we haveuˆyˆo-vˆβkoxˆo-u0+(1-αko)u0⩽uˆαkoyˆk-vˆαkoxˆk-αkou0⩽0.Since DMUois BCC-WR-efficient,uˆyˆo-u0=1andvˆxˆo=1. Thus, we get 1−βko⩽(αko−1)u0, which impliesu0⩾1-βkoαko-1⩾0. Since k′∈Aoand0<αk′o<1, similar to the above process, it can be shown thatβk′o⩽1and1-βk′o⩽(αk′o-1)u0which implyu0⩽1-βk′oαk′o-1⩽0. Hence, uo=0. Therefore, CRS prevail, because of Theorem 1 and Theorem 5 in Korhonen et al. (2011).□Now, utilizing the above result, Algorithm 3 in Korhonen et al. (2011) can be improved by adding the following if-then statement:Ifαko<1for somek∈Ao,andαk′o>1for somek′∈Ao,then CRS prevail at(xo,yo).The enhanced algorithm can find out the RTS classification of additional (previously undiagnosed) DMUs without solving any LP models, via calculating some ratios.We next focus on case (iv). It can be divided into five sub-cases:(a):αko=1,αk′o>1, andαk″o<1for some k, k′, k″∈Ao,αko=1andαk′o>1for somek,k′∈Ao,andαko⩾1for eachk∈Ao,αko=1andαk′o<1for somek,k′∈Ao,andαko⩽1for eachk∈Ao,αko=1 for each k∈Aoand Ao⧹{o}≠∅,αko=1 for each k∈Aoand Ao={o}.Case (a) is an overlap of cases (iii) and (iv), and in this case CRS prevail as proved in Theorem 1. The following theorems clarify the RTS situation when case (b) or (c) occurs (NIRS≡CRS or DRS. Also, NDRS≡CRS or IRS). The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to that of Theorems 1 and 2.Theorem 2Suppose that αko=1 andαk′o>1for some k,k′∈Ao, and αko⩾1 for each k∈Ao. Then NIRS prevail at (xo,yo).Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, uo⩾0 in all optimal solutions of multiplier BCC model. Therefore, NIRS prevail, by Theorem 1 and Theorem 5 in Korhonen et al. (2011).□Suppose that αko=1 andαk′o<1for some k, k′∈Ao, and αko⩽1 for each k∈Ao. Then NDRS prevail at (xo,yo).If DMUois a strongly BCC-WR-efficient unit, then case (d) does not occur.If case (d) occurs, then there exists k≠o such that k∈Aoand αko=1. By (1), we getyˆk⩾yˆo. Furthermore, βko⩽βoo=1, which impliesxˆk⩽xˆo, because of (2). Therefore, we have(-xˆk,yˆk)⩾(-xˆo,yˆo)which contradicts the strong BCC-WR-efficiency of DMUo(Note that there are no duplicate DMUs).□Note that case (d) may occur in the presence of weakly efficient DMUs. Some examples can easily be constructed to demonstrate that CRS, DRS, or IRS can prevail in case of (d) or (e). Hence, we cannot know for certain the RTS class, when αko=1 for each k∈Ao.
