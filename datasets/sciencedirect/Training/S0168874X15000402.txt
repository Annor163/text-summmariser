In this paper, the modal analysis to estimate eigenvalue and eigenvector of structures with fuzzy parameters is presented. By introducing fuzzy parameters into the Rayleigh quotient variation, the fuzzy variational principle is developed. The fuzzy finite element method is proposed as the application of the fuzzy variational principle. The proposed fuzzy finite element method can obtain fuzzy eigenvalues and fuzzy eigenvectors directly. However, when the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are used for fuzzy analysis, the fuzzy parameters have to be transformed into the interval parameters before the calculation and the fuzzy results are subsequently constructed by the interval results. The proposed method avoids these roundabout procedures in comparison with the conventional fuzzy finite element methods. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the computational cost and increase computational efficiency. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The modal analysis of structures plays an important role in the design and analysis of structural systems. However, real engineering structures are usually complicated systems, which possess various uncertainties due to the manufacture errors, measurement errors and other factors. Consequently, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of structural systems are also uncertain.The modal analysis of structures with uncertain parameters has been the subject of some scientists and engineers for many years. Deif [1] proposed a method to obtain interval eigenvalues for the standard interval eigenvalue problem. Considering the characteristics of structural systems through the non-negative decomposition of the mass and stiffness matrices, Qiu et al. [2] presented an approach for solving the generalized interval eigenvalue problem. Sim et al. [3] developed a modal analysis method to estimate modal parameters, frequency response function and mode shapes of structures with uncertain-but-bounded parameters via interval analysis. Zhu and Wu [4] proposed a stochastic finite element method for both distinct and repeated eigenvalues and derived formulae for the variance and covariance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Based on the perturbation approach, Song et al. [5] applied a method to obtain the stochastic sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which does not greatly increase the computational cost compared to deterministic analysis. Chen and Rao [6] developed a methodology using the fuzzy finite element method for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of imprecisely defined systems. Based on α-cut discretization of fuzzy numbers and Taylor׳s expansion, Massa et al. [7] presented an efficient methodology to calculate fuzzy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite element structures defined by fuzzy parameters. As we can see above, there are several methods to deal with uncertain analysis of structures: the interval-based methods; the stochastic-based methods; and the fuzzy-based methods, etc. When the system parameters are described in linguistic or imprecise terms, the fuzzy-based methods are appropriate [8].Among numerical methods for the fuzzy analysis of structural systems, the fuzzy finite element method is a widely used method. Based on the theory of fuzzy sets, Valliappan and Pham [9] proposed a finite element model to take account of the uncertainty in the soil behavior and considered the elastic modulus and Poisson׳s ratio as fuzzy numbers. Rao and Sawyer [8] developed a fuzzy finite element approach for the static analysis of structural systems with parameters described in linguistic or imprecise terms, this method can be applied to analyze problems involving vaguely defined geometry, material properties, external loads and boundary conditions. Wasfy and Noor [10] presented a fuzzy finite element method for predicting the dynamic response and evaluating the sensitivity coefficients of flexible multibody systems with fuzzy parameters. By using the interval finite element method, Moens and Vandepitte [11] and Gersem et al. [12] introduced a numerical algorithm to calculate frequency-response functions of damped finite element models with fuzzy uncertain parameters. Based on a sensitivity analysis and a high order Taylor series expansion, Massa et al. [13] proposed a fuzzy procedure for the static design of imprecise structures. This methodology can deal with structures modeled by imprecise material or geometric parameters and subjected to imprecise boundary conditions and imprecise external loads. Verhaeghe et al. [14] discussed the application of the concept of interval fields and developed a fuzzy finite element analysis technique for structural static analysis based on interval fields to cope with the problem that mutual dependency between multiple uncertain model parameters can׳t be included in the analysis. Farkas et al. [15] applied a reanalysis-based finite element method for static structural analysis and this approach is explicitly suited for optimisation-based black-box techniques. Nearly all these fuzzy finite element methods are based on the interval calculation. When these fuzzy finite element methods are used for the fuzzy analysis, the fuzzy parameters have to be transformed into interval parameters through the concept of α-level to calculate the interval results at each α-level of interest. The fuzzy results are subsequently constructed by all the obtained interval results. So the computational cost of these methods is expensive.The variational principle is one of the important theoretical bases of the finite element method [16]. Many scientists studied the deterministic variational principle and there are a lot of research works on deterministic variational principles [16–18]. In the field of uncertain variational principle, scientists focused their attentions on stochastic variational principle. By combining the Hu−Washizu variational principle with second-order perturbation techniques, Liu et al. [19] established a probabilistic Hu−Washizu variational principle for the probabilistic finite element method. Hien and Kleiber [20] formulated a stochastic Hamilton variational principle for dynamic problems of linear continuum. The stochastic Hamilton variational principle allows incorporation of probabilistic distributions into the finite element analysis. Elishakoff et al. [21] proposed a stochastic variational principle for the mean and covariance functions of the displacement of stochastic beams and based on the stochastic variational principle, Galerkin and Rayleigh−Ritz methods were presented to find probabilistic characteristics of the response. Impollonia and Elishakoff [22] extended the stochastic variational principle to the probabilistic response of shear beams with stochastic flexibility, and subjected to deterministic static loads. Expanding all the random quantities involved in the energy functional through second-order perturbation techniques, Yang et al. [23] presented the stochastic transient variational principle for vibration analysis of linear continuum. Based on the stochastic variational principle and second-order perturbation techniques, Yang et al. [24] developed a stochastic spline Ritz method to analyze the structures consisting of elastic beams and plates by a local average of the homogeneous random field. However, there are no research works on the fuzzy variational principle until Yang et al. [25] proposed the fuzzy variational principle for static analysis of structural systems with fuzzy parameters.In this paper, based on Rayleigh quotient variation and perturbation techniques, the fuzzy variational principle for modal analysis of structural systems is presented. The fuzzy finite element method is developed as the application of the fuzzy variational principle. The proposed fuzzy finite element method can obtain the fuzzy result directly. Compared with the conventional fuzzy finite element methods, the proposed method can reduce the computational cost. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practicability of the proposed method.For the sake of simplicity, in this section, indicial notation is employed with indices repeated twice implying summation.The Rayleigh quotient variation is one of the important theoretical bases of the finite element method for modal analysis of structural systems. Its general form can be described by(1)ω2=stVmaxT,where ω is the natural frequency, Vmax is the maximum of the potential energy of elastic, T is the kinetic energy coefficient, and st denotes the operation to find the stationary value of a functional.If there are fuzzy factors in structural systems, the expression of the Rayleigh quotient variation will be a fuzzy functional, which can be written as(2)ω˜2=stV˜maxT˜,whereω˜is the fuzzy natural frequency,V˜maxis the fuzzy maximum of the potential energy of elastic,T˜is the fuzzy kinetic energy coefficient.V˜maxcan be expressed as(3)V˜max=12∫VD˜ijklε˜ijε˜kldV,whereD˜ijklis the fuzzy tensor of elastic moduli,ε˜ijis the fuzzy strain tensor.T˜can be expressed as(4)T˜=12∫Vρ˜u˜iu˜idV,whereρ˜is the fuzzy density,u˜iis the fuzzy displacement vector.The constitutive relation is(5)σ˜ij=D˜ijklε˜kl,whereσ˜ijis the fuzzy stress tensor.For the sake of simplicity, we can build the following equations(6)U˜=12D˜ijklε˜ijε˜kl,and(7)M˜=12ρ˜u˜iu˜i.Then Eq. (2) can be written as(8)δ∫VU˜dV=λ˜δ∫VM˜dV,whereλ˜=ω˜2is the fuzzy eigenvalue.All the fuzzy variables of structural systems including geometric parameters, physical parameters, external forces, and boundary conditions, etc., can be denoted with the fuzzy vector field(9)X˜={X˜1,X˜2,⋯,X˜r}T,where r is the number of fuzzy parameters. The fuzzy fieldX˜can be decomposed as follows(10)X˜=X0+β˜,where(11)X0={X01,X02,⋯,X0r}T,β˜={β˜1,β˜2,⋯,β˜r}T,X0m(m=1,2,…,r)is the real value ofX˜m(m=1,2,…,r), andβ˜m(m=1,2,…,r)is the fuzzy perturbation quantity with zero real value.λ˜is dependent on the fuzzy vector fieldX˜, so we can expandλ˜about the real valueX0 of the fuzzy fieldX˜via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only(12)λ˜=λ0+β˜mλ,m,where λ0 denotes λ evaluated at the real value of the fuzzy field, λ,mdenotes the first-order partial derivative of λ to the field variable Xmat the real pointX0 in the fuzzy vector field. Similar expansions can be made for other fuzzy quantitiesu˜i,ε˜ij,U˜andM˜, etc.Substituting the expansions of the fuzzy quantitiesU˜,c˜ijklandε˜ijinto Eq. (6) and taking advantage of perturbation techniques, we can obtain(13)U0=12D0ijklε0ijε0kl,U,m=12Dijkl,mε0ijε0kl+D0ijklεij,mε0kl.Similarly, Eq. (5) leads to(14)σ0ij=D0ijklε0kl,σij,m=Dijkl,mε0kl+D0ijklεkl,m.Comparing Eqs. (13) and (14), we will have(15)∂U0∂ε0ij=∂U,m∂εij,m=σ0ij,∂U,m∂ε0ij=σij,m.Similarly, Eq. (7) leads to(16)∂M0∂u0i=∂M,m∂ui,m=ρ0u0i,∂M,m∂u0i=ρ,mu0i+ρ0ui,m.Substituting the expansions ofλ˜,U˜andM˜into Eq. (8), and employing first-order perturbation techniques, we will obtainZeroth-order perturbation terms(17)δ∫VU0dV=λ0δ∫VM0dV.First-order perturbation terms(18)δ∫VU,mdV=λ,mδ∫VM0dV+λ0δ∫VM,mdV.Zeroth-order perturbation terms lead to(19)∫V∂U0∂ε0ijδε0ijdV=λ0∫V∂M0∂u0iδu0idV.Taking account of Ostrovski−Gauss formula, we can obtain(20)−∫V(∂U0∂ε0ij),jδu0idV+∫Sσ∂U0∂ε0ijnjδu0idV=λ0∫V∂M0∂u0iδu0idV.Substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (20) yields(21)∫V(σ0ij,j+λ0ρ0u0i)δu0idV−∫Sσσ0ijnjδu0idV=0.Since δu0iis arbitrary, we can obtain(22){σ0ij,j+λ0ρ0u0i=0inV,σ0ijnj=0onSσ.First-order perturbation terms lead to(23)∫V(∂U,m∂ε0ijδε0ij+∂U,m∂εij,mδεij,m)dV=λ,m∫V∂M0∂u0iδu0idV+λ0∫V(∂M,m∂u0iδu0i+∂M,m∂ui,mδui,m)dV.Similarly, taking advantage of Ostrovski−Gauss formula, we will have(24)−∫V(∂U,m∂ε0ij),jδu0idV+∫Sσ∂U,m∂ε0ijnjδu0idS−∫V(∂U,m∂εij,m),jδui,mdV+∫Sσ∂U,m∂εij,mnjδui,mdS=λ,m∫V∂M0∂u0iδu0idV+λ0∫V(∂M,m∂u0iδu0i+∂M,m∂ui,mδui,m)dV.Substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (24) yields(25)∫V(σij,jm+λ,mρ0u0i+λ0ρ,mu0i+λ0ρ0ui,m)δu0idV+∫V(σ0ij,j+λ0ρ0u0i)δui,mdV−∫Sσσij,mnjδu0idV−∫Sσσ0ijnjδui,mdV=0.Since δu0iand δui,mare arbitrary and independent, we can obtain(26){σij,jm+λ,mρ0u0i+λ0ρ,mu0i+λ0ρ0ui,m=0inV,σij,mnj=0onSσ,{σ0ij,j+λ0ρ0u0i=0inV,σ0ijnj=0onSσ.Comparing Eqs. (22) and (26), we can conclude that, for the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, the stationary conditions of first-order perturbation terms include the stationary conditions of zeroth-order perturbation terms. As a result, when the fuzzy variational principle is applied to deal with the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, only first-order perturbation terms are necessary to derive all the required governing equations and boundary conditions.For the sake of clarity, in this section, matrix notation is adopted instead of tensor notation.V˜maxandT˜can be written in the form(27)V˜max=12∫Vε˜TD˜ε˜dV,and(28)T˜=12∫Vu˜Tρ˜u˜dV.So the Rayleigh quotient variation can be expressed as(29)δ∫V12ε˜TD˜ε˜dV=λ˜δ∫V12u˜Tρ˜u˜dV,When the finite element method is applied to analyze the structure, the structure should be discretized. Through interpolation of element displacement field, we have(30)u˜e=∑i=1tNi(x)a˜ei=Na˜e,where(31)N={N1,N2,…,Nt},a˜e={a˜e1,a˜e2,…,a˜et},in which t denotes the node numbers of each element,a˜eidenotes the displacement of the ith node of element e andNis the shape function matrix.a˜eis dependent on the fuzzy vector fieldX˜, which is expressed as Eq. (9), so we can expanda˜eabout the real valueX0 of the fuzzy fieldX˜via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only(32)a˜e=ae0+∑m=1rβ˜mae,m,whereae0 denotesaeevaluated at the real value of the fuzzy field,ae,mdenotes the first-order partial derivative ofaeto the field variable Xmat the real pointX0 in the fuzzy vector field.Similar expansion can be made foru˜e(33)u˜e=ue0+∑m=1rβ˜mue,m.Substituting Eqs. (32) and (33) into Eq. (30) and comparing the coefficient ofβ˜, we will have(34){ue0=Nae0,ue,m=Nae,m,m=1,2,…,r.The strain vectorε˜eand the displacement vectora˜esatisfy the following relationship(35)ε˜e=Lu˜e=LNa˜e=Ba˜e,where L denotes the differential operator andBdenotes the strain matrix. Taking advantage of perturbation techniques, Eq. (35) yields(36){εe0=Bae0,εe,m=Bae,m,m=1,2,…,r.Consider the conclusion that, when the fuzzy variational principle is applied to deal with the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, only first-order perturbation terms are necessary to derive all the required governing equations and boundary conditions. Substituting the first-order perturbation based expansions of the fuzzy quantitiesρ˜,D˜,u˜andε˜into Eq. (29), we can obtain first-order perturbation terms(37)δ∫V(12ae0TBD,mBae0+ae0TBD0Bae,m)dV=λ,mδ∫V12ae0TNρ0Nae0dV+λ0δ∫V12ae0TNρ,mNae0dV+λ0δ∫Vae0TNρ0Nae,mdV.The above equation leads to(38)δae0T[∫VBD,mBdVae0+∫VBD0BdVae,m]+δae,mT∫VBD0BdVae0=λ,mδae0T∫VNρ0NdVae0+λ0δae0T[∫VNρ,mNdVae0+∫VNρ0NdVae,m]+λ0δae,mT∫VNρ0NdVae0.Eq. (38) can be transformed as(39)δae0T[∫VBD,mBdVae0+∫VBD0BdVae,m−λ,m∫VNρ0NdVae0−λ0∫VNρ,mNdVae0−λ0∫VNρ0NdVae,m]+δae,mT[∫VBD0BdVae0−λ0∫VNρ0NdVae0]=0.Sinceδae,mTandδae0Tare arbitrary and independent, the above equation leads to(40)∫VBD0BdVae0−λ0∫VNρ0NdVae0=0,and(41)∫VBD,mBdVae0+∫VBD0BdVae,m−λ,m∫VNρ0NdVae0−λ0∫VNρ,mNdVae0−λ0∫VNρ0NdVae,m=0,m=1,2,…,r.For the sake of simplicity, Eq. (40) can be expressed as(42)Ke0ae0−λ0Me0ae0=0,where(43)Ke0=∫VBTD0BdV,Me0=∫VNTρ0NdV.Eq. (41) can be expressed as(44)Ke,mae0+Ke0ae,m−λ,mMe0ae0−λ0Me,mae0−λ0Me0ae,m=0,m=1,2,…,r,where(45)Ke,m=∫VBTD,mBdV,Me,m=∫VNTρ,mNdV.Then we build the following equation(46)ae0=Jea0,whereae0 denotes the real value of displacement vector of element e,a0 denotes the real value of the displacement vector of the whole structural system, Jedenotes the transmit matrix of element e.Substituting Eq. (46) into Eq. (42) yields(47)Ke0Jea0−λ0Me0Jea0=0.Multiplying both sides of Eq. (47) withJeTyields(48)JeTKe0Jea0−λ0JeTMe0Jea0=0.Every element has an equilibrium equation which is similar to Eq. (48), putting them together, we will have(49)K0a0−λ0M0a0=0,where(50)K0=∑e=1NJeTKe0Je,M0=∑e=1NJeTMe0Je,in which N is the number of elements.Similarly, Eq. (44) can be expressed as(51)K,ma0+K0a,m−λ,mM0a0−λ0M,ma0−λ0M0a,m=0,m=1,2,…,r,where(52)K,m=∑e=1NJeTKe,mJe,M,m=∑e=1NJeTMe,mJe.The normalizing condition is(53)a˜iTM˜a˜i=1.Expandinga˜iandM˜about the real valueX0 of the fuzzy fieldX˜via Taylor series, and retaining up to first-order terms only, we will have(54)a˜i=ai0+∑m=1rβ˜mai,m,and(55)M˜=M0+∑m=1rβ˜mM,m.Substituting Eqs. (54) and (55) into Eq. (53), and taking advantage of perturbation techniques, we can obtain(56)ai0TM0ai0=1,and(57)ai,mTM0ai0+ai0TM,mai0+ai0TM0ai,m=0,m=1,2,…,r.Therefore, equations of the fuzzy finite element method for the modal analysis are a set of deterministic recursive equations as follows(58)K0a0−λ0M0a0=0,(59)ai0TM0ai0=1,(60)K,ma0+K0a,m−λ,mM0a0−λ0M,ma0−λ0M0a,m=0,m=1,2,…,r,(61)ai,mTM0ai0+ai0TM,mai0+ai0TM0ai,m=0,m=1,2,…,r.Eq. (58) leads to(62)det(K0−λ0M0)=0.Solving the above equation, we can obtain the real value of fuzzy eigenvalue λi0. We will confine ourselves to the case in which the real values of fuzzy eigenvaluesλi0,i=1,2,…,nare all distinct, where n is the number of eigenvalues. Substituting λi0 into Eq. (58) and considering Eq. (59), we will have the real value of the normal eigenvectorai0. Substituting λi0 andai0 into Eq. (60) yields(63)(K0−λi0M0)ai,m+(K,m−λi,mM0−λi0M,m)ai0=0.According to the expansion theorem, we can build the following equation(64)ai,m=∑j=1nbijaj0.Substituting Eq. (64) into Eq. (63) yields(65)(K0−λi0M0)∑j=1nbijaj0+(K,m−λi,mM0−λi0M,m)ai0=0.Multiplying both sides of Eq. (65) withas0T, we have(66)as0T(K0−λi0M0)∑j=1nbijaj0+as0T(K,m−λi,mM0−λi0M,m)ai0=0.Considering the normalizing condition, we can obtain(67)bis(λi0−λs0)+λi,mδis=as0T(K,m−λi0M,m)ai0.When i=s, Eq. (67) leads to(68)λi,m=ai0T(K,m−λi0M,m)ai0.When i≠s, Eq. (67) leads to(69)bis=1λi0−λs0as0T(K,m−λi0M,m)ai0(s≠i).Multiplying both sides of Eq. (64) withas0TM0yields(70)as0TM0ai,m=∑j=1nbijas0TM0aj0.When s=i, Eq. (70) leads to(71)bii=ai0TM0ai,m.Taking the transpose of both side of Eq. (71) yields(72)bii=ai,mTM0ai0.Substituting Eqs. (71) and (72) into Eq. (61), we will have(73)bii=−12ai0TM,mai0(s=i).Substituting Eqs. (69) and (73) into Eq. (64) yields(74)ai,m=−12ai0TM,mai0ai0+∑j=1,j≠in1λi0−λj0aj0T(K,m−λi0M,m)ai0aj0.Expandingλ˜ianda˜iabout the real valueX0 of the fuzzy fieldX˜via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only, we will have(75)λ˜i=λi0+∑m=1rβ˜mλi,m,and(76)a˜i=ai0+∑m=1rβ˜mai,m.Substituting λi0, λi,m,ai0 andai,minto Eqs. (75) and (76), and following the binary fuzzy arithmetic operations [25], we can obtain the fuzzy eigenvalueλ˜iand the fuzzy eigenvectora˜iof structures with fuzzy parameters.Three examples will be applied to demonstrate the proposed method in this paper. The first is a simply supported beam, which has the analytical solution for the eigenvalue, so it is convenient for us to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in this example. The second is a five-story frame tower structure. In this example, we will solve the problem by using both the proposed method and the conventional fuzzy finite element method, the comparison will illustrate that the proposed method can reduce computational cost. The last example is a 25-bar space truss, in which the fuzzy parameters are the cross-sectional area of the bars. With these fuzzy parameters, both the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix will be fuzzy simultaneously. This is the case that geometric parameters are fuzzy, which is very common in the practical engineering.Example 1A simply supported elastic beam with fuzzy parameters.Consider a simply supported elastic beam with uniform cross sections as shown inFig. 1. The densityρ˜and the Young׳s moduliE˜of the beam are considered as fuzzy parameters. According to the opinions of experts, the real values ofρ˜andE˜are taken as ρ0 and E0, respectively. The possible low and high values ofρ˜andE˜are[ρl,ρh]=[0.95ρ0,1.05ρ0]and[El,Eh]=[0.98E0,1.02E0], respectively. The moment of inertia and the cross-sectional area of the beam are I and A, respectively. The fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method is plotted inFig. 2.To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, the fuzzy analytical method is used as a benchmark. Taking the density ρ and the Young׳s moduli E in the analytical solution for the eigenvalue of the supported beam as fuzzy parameters, we can obtain the fuzzy analytical method for this example. The fuzzy ith-order eigenvalue by the fuzzy analytical method is given by(77)λ˜i=i4π4E˜Iρ˜AL4.Table 1 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first order eigenvalue by the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method at various α-levels. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first ten eigenvalues by the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method at α=0.6 is shown inTable 2. In Tables 1 and 2, PM and FAM denote the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method, respectively. The multipliers of the eigenvalues in Fig. 1, Table 1 and Table 2 are allE0I/(ρ0AL4).From Table 1 we can see that with the decrease of α, the error between the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method becomes bigger. Table 2 shows that the error between the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. And it can be seen that the maximal error in Tables 1 and 2 is 0.62%, which generally can satisfy the accuracy demanding in the engineering. So we can conclude that, when the fuzziness in parameters is small, the proposed method has good accuracy at various order of eigenvalue.Example 2A five-story frame tower structure.Consider a five-story frame structure with fuzzy parameters as shown inFig. 3(a). Assume that the horizontal members are very rigid compared to the columns of the frame. This assumption reduces the system to only five degrees of freedom as shown in Fig. 3(b). According to the opinions of experts, the total stiffness and the mass of each story have fuzzy values, and the fuzzy values are listed inTable 3.Fig. 4 shows the fuzzy third order eigenvalue by the proposed method. The fuzzy third order eigenvector by the proposed method are plotted inFig. 5. If we set α=0.5 in Fig. 5, we will obtain the bounds of the third order eigenvector at α=0.5 as shown inFig. 6. So we can conclude that, based on the fuzzy result by the proposed method, it is easy to obtain the interval result at the interested α-level. The range between lower and upper bounds of all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors at α=0.5 are listed inTable 4.Table 5 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various α-levels. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first five eigenvalues by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at α=0.5 is shown inTable 6. In Tables 5 and 6, PM and MCS denote the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation, respectively.From Table 5 we can see that with the decrease of α, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes bigger. Table 6 shows that the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. And it can be seen that the maximal error in Tables 5 and 6 is 0.97%, which generally can satisfy the accuracy demanding in the engineering.When the method proposed in this paper is applied to obtain the fuzzy third order eigenvalue of this example, we can use the fuzzy parameters for the calculation directly. To obtain the fuzzy result, we only need to calculate once. The formulation of the fuzzy third order eigenvalue by the proposed method can be written as(78)λ˜=[103.567,L(λ),R(λ)],where(79)L(λ)={λ−103.5679.815+1,93.752<λ≤103.567,0,λ≤93.752,R(λ)={103.567−λ9.815+1,103.567≤λ<113.382,0,λ≥113.382.With the above equations, we can plot the fuzzy result as Fig. 4.If the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are used, for example, the method presented in Ref. [7], we have to transform the fuzzy parameters into interval parameters through α-cut. For this example, if five levels of α-cut ( 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1) are considered for each fuzzy parameters, the fuzzy stiffness and mass parameters have to be transformed into interval parameters as listed inTable 7. And then, we need to calculate the interval results of the fuzzy third order eigenvalue at each level of α-cut, for this example, by using the method presented in Ref. [7], we need to calculate five times to obtain the interval results as shown inTable 8. With all the interval results, the fuzzy third order eigenvalue finally can be constructed as shown inFig. 7.In the proposed method, the fuzzy field with r uncertain variables is not transformed into interval fields. So the governing equations are consisted of r+1 systems of equations, in which, there is one system with the zeroth-order, r systems with the first-order. For this example, r=10, so there are only 11 hierarchical systems of equations. By solving these equations, the fuzzy results can be obtained directly. When the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are used for fuzzy analysis, the fuzzy field has to be transformed into s interval fields, i.e. each of the fuzzy parameters has to be transformed into s interval parameters. So the governing equations of the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are consisted of s×(r+1) systems of equations, in which, there is s zeroth-order expanded systems of equation, s×r first-order systems. For this example, each of the 10 fuzzy parameters is transformed into 5 interval parameters, i.e. s=5, r=10, there are 55 hierarchical systems of equations. By solving these equations, only the interval results can be obtained. To obtain the fuzzy results, we have to construct the fuzzy results by the interval results. The proposed method can avoid these roundabout procedures. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the computational cost in comparison with the conventional fuzzy finite element methods.Example 3A 25-bar space truss.Consider a 25-bar space truss as shown inFig. 8. The member areas are linked into the following groups: A1;A2=A3=A4=A5;A6=A7=A8=A9;A10=A11;A12=A13;A14=A15=A16=A17;A18=A19=A20=A21; andA22=A23=A24=A25. In this example, a total of ten system modal parameters, indicating the member areas, Young׳s modulus and material density, are considered as fuzzy numbers and are listed inTable 9, where the variable coefficient β∈[0,1].Fig. 9 shows the fuzzy first order eigenvalue of this example. From Fig. 9 we can see that when α=1 or β=0, the eigenvalue by the proposed method is deterministic, with the decrease of α or the increase of β, the difference between the upper and lower bound becomes bigger. By setting α of the fuzzy first order eigenvector at different interested levels, we can obtain the interval results of the fuzzy first order eigenvector at various α-levels when β=1 as listed inTable 10.Table 11 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first ten eigenvalues by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at α=0.5, β=0.5. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various α-levels when β=0.5 is shown inTable 12.Table 13 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various β when α=0.5. In Tables 11, 12 and 13, PM and MCS denote the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation, respectively.Table 11 shows that the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. From Table 12 we can see that with the decrease of α, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes bigger. Table 13 shows that with the decrease of β, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes less. Therefore, with the increase of α or the decrease of β, the error of the proposed method becomes less, i.e. the accuracy of the proposed method becomes better.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, by introducing fuzzy parameters into Rayleigh quotient variation, the fuzzy variational principle for modal analysis is developed. The fuzzy finite element method is proposed as the application of the fuzzy variational principle. The proposed fuzzy finite element method can obtain the fuzzy result directly. The proposed method avoids the roundabout procedures frequently used in the conventional fuzzy finite element methods. Therefore, the proposed method can increase computational efficiency. The results of numerical examples indicate that the proposed method has good accuracy and needs less computational efforts.
