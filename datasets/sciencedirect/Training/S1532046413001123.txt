@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The management of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical issue resulting from the overwhelming amount of information available on them. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can provide an interesting way to reduce the time spent by healthcare professionals on reviewing biomedical literature. However, NLP techniques rely mostly on the availability of the annotated corpora. While there are several annotated corpora with biological entities and their relationships, there is a lack of corpora annotated with pharmacological substances and DDIs. Moreover, other works in this field have focused in pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs only, but not in pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs. To address this problem, we have created a manually annotated corpus consisting of 792 texts selected from the DrugBank database and other 233 Medline abstracts. This fined-grained corpus has been annotated with a total of 18,502 pharmacological substances and 5028 DDIs, including both PK as well as PD interactions. The quality and consistency of the annotation process has been ensured through the creation of annotation guidelines and has been evaluated by the measurement of the inter-annotator agreement between two annotators. The agreement was almost perfect (Kappa up to 0.96 and generally over 0.80), except for the DDIs in the MedLine database (0.55–0.72). The DDI corpus has been used in the SemEval 2013 DDIExtraction challenge as a gold standard for the evaluation of information extraction techniques applied to the recognition of pharmacological substances and the detection of DDIs from biomedical texts. DDIExtraction 2013 has attracted wide attention with a total of 14 teams from 7 different countries. For the task of recognition and classification of pharmacological names, the best system achieved an F1 of 71.5%, while, for the detection and classification of DDIs, the best result was F1 of 65.1%. These results show that the corpus has enough quality to be used for training and testing NLP techniques applied to the field of Pharmacovigilance. The DDI corpus and the annotation guidelines are free for use for academic research and are available at http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/ddicorpus.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Motivated by the information explosion in Biomedicine, over the last decade there has been a surge of interest in using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to retrieve and extract information from biomedical texts [1]. Most of these techniques rely heavily on annotated corpora to learn models that can be used to extract information from raw text. Annotated corpora are valuable resources as they provide a gold standard data for the repeatable automatic training and evaluation of NLP techniques [2]. Most recent research has centered on biological entities and their relationships (such as gene and protein interactions) mainly as a result of the availability of annotated corpora in the biological domain (see Section 2).Other biomedical domains such as Pharmacovigilance (the science concerned with the prevention of adverse drug reactions) can benefit from NLP techniques. This is the case of drug–drug interactions (DDIs), which are a common adverse drug reactions having a significant impact on patient safety and healthcare costs [3,4]. Although there is a large quantity of drug databases and semi-structured resources (such as DrugBank [5], Stockley [6] or Drug Interactions Facts [7], among others) to assist healthcare professionals avoid DDIs, the quality of these databases is very uneven and the consistency of their content is limited, so it is very difficult to assign a real clinical significance to each interaction [8,9]. On the other hand, despite the availability of these databases, a large amount of the most current and valuable information is unstructured, written in natural language and hidden in published articles, scientific journals, books and technical reports [3]. Only in the bibliographic database MedLine, the number of published researches is increased between 10,000 and 20,000 articles per week [10]. Therefore, researchers and healthcare professionals must review a large number of drug safety reports as well as publications in the fields of medicine and pharmacology in order to be kept up-to-date with everything published about DDIs. Several published drug safety studies have shown that DDIs may be detected too late, when millions of patients have already been exposed [11]. Therefore, the management of DDIs is a critical issue as a result of the overwhelming amount of information available on them [12]. Thus, the development of automatic methods for collecting, maintaining and interpreting the information about drugs is crucial to achieving a real improvement in the early detection of DDIs.In this paper, we describe the construction of a gold standard corpus, called the DDI corpus, which is annotated with pharmacological substances as well as the interactions between them. The DDI corpus is the first corpus which includes pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs. A PD DDI occurs when the pharmacological effects of one drug are modified by the presence of another drug, while a PK DDI is the result from the interference of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or elimination of a drug by another drug. While there are several annotated corpora with biological entities and their relationships (see Section 2), the shortage of annotated corpora for DDI extraction is the main bottleneck in the development of NLP systems for this area of Pharmacovigilance.The DDI corpus has been developed for the DDI Extraction 2013 challenge (http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task9/), whose main goal is to provide a common framework for the evaluation of information extraction techniques applied to the recognition of pharmacological substances and the detection of DDIs from biomedical texts. For this purpose, two substasks have been proposed: the recognition and classification of drug names and the extraction and classification of their interactions. A detailed description of the task, the participant teams, the results and the evaluation metrics can be found in [13].
