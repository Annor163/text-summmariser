@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper investigates the anchor points in nonconvex Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), called Free Disposal Hull (FDH), technologies. We develop the concept of anchor points under various returns to scale assumptions in FDH models. A necessary and sufficient condition for characterizing the anchor points is provided. Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme units, a definition of extreme units in non-convex technologies as well as a new method for obtaining these units are given. Finally, a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of the anchor points in FDH models is provided. Obtaining both extreme units and anchor points is done via calculating only some ratios, without solving any mathematical programming problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The boundary of the Production Possibility Set (PPS) (production technology) plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and productivity analysis. There are several tools in the literature to estimate the PPS and its boundary. One of the most important and widely-used approaches is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric Linear Programming-based technique. DEA was first introduced by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) and was developed by many scholars; see e.g. Cook and Seiford (2009), Cooper, Seiford, and Tone (2007), Emrouznejad, Parker, and Tavares (2008), and Hatami-Marbini, Emrouznejad, and Tavana (2011) for some reviews.An important class of DEA technologies is that of FDH models. These models, which have been first presented by Deprins, Simar, and Tulkens (1984), evaluate the Decision Making Units (DMUs) considering the closest inner approximation of the true strongly disposable (but possibly non-convex) technology. FDH models have been studied by many scholars, including Tulkens (1993), Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999), Cherchye, Kuosmanen, and Post (2000), 2001), Podinovski (2004), Leleu (2006), Briec, Kerstens, and Vanden Eeckaut (2004), Briec and Kerstens (2006), Soleimani-damaneh, Jahanshahloo, and Reshadi (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Soleimani-damaneh and Mostafaee (2009). See also, Kerstens and Woestyne (2014) for a recent review of the solution methods in FDH models.Studying the boundary points of DEA technologies is a very important issue in performance analysis and this leads to theoretical and practical observations which are useful in studying the structure of efficiency and inefficiency. Charnes, Cooper, and Thrall (1991) classified Decision Making Units (DMUs) to six classes based upon their efficiency situation, the dimension of dual solution set, and the positivity of the optimal multipliers. In another work in the economics literature, Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1983) classified the boundary points of production technologies to three classes, isoquant, weak efficient, and efficient. They utilized this classification to address the question, what is technical inefficiency and where does it come from?An important set of boundary points which are defined according to the positivity of optimal multipliers is that of anchor points.Thanassoulis and Allen (1998) used the concept of these points, at first, for the generation of unobserved DMUs and extending the DEA frontier. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) defined these points formally as production possibilities which give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the boundary of the PPS. Rouse (2004) utilized this notion for identifying prices for health care services. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) used the geometrical properties of the anchor points to design and test an algorithm for their identification. Thanassoulis, Kortelainen, and Allen (2012) provided another method for identifying the anchor points based upon the radial efficiency scores and slack variables at the optimal solution of envelopment models. They have used this concept for improving envelopment under multiple inputs and outputs in a VRS technology. In a recently published paper, Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014) presented an algorithm for identification of the anchor points utilizing sensitivity analysis techniques. See also Bougnol (2001) and Allen and Thanassoulis (2004) for more details about the notion and applications of the anchor points.All of the above-mentioned works have been done on anchor points under convex technologies. In this paper, we study the anchor points in (nonconvex) FDH models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on anchor points in nonconvex technologies. We define the extreme unit and anchor point notions in nonconvex technologies. Since the first step for obtaining the anchor points is obtaining the extreme units, a ratio-based technique for determining the extreme units in FDH models is presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions for characterizing the anchor points are established, and utilizing them, a ratio-based technique is given for determining the anchor points. Both given ratio-based techniques are polynomial-time and they work without solving any mathematical programming problem.The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: In Section 2, some preliminaries are provided. Section 3 is devoted to defining and identifying the extreme units in FDH technologies. In Section 4, the anchor point notion in FDH technologies is defined and after presenting a characterization, a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of these points is presented. In addition to the theoretical results, some numerical examples are given. Eventually, Section 5 contains a short conclusion.Suppose that we have a set ofnpeer DMUs,{DMUj,j∈J={1,2,…,n}},such that each DMUjproduces multiple outputsyrj>0(r=1,…,s)by utilizing multiple inputsxij>0(i=1,…,m). We assume that there is not any duplicated DMU. Furthermore, letxj=(x1j,…,xmj)Tandyj=(y1j,…,ysj)T. Superscript “T” stands for transpose.A unified algebraic representation of FDH technologies under different Returns to Scale (RTS) assumptions can be expressed as follows:PΓ={(x,y):∑j∈Jλjxj≤x,∑j∈Jλjyj≥y≥0,λj=δωj;j∈J,∑j∈Jωj=1,ω∈({0,1})n,δ∈Γ},where Γ, depending on the RTS assumption of the reference technology, is(1)ΓVRS={δ|δ=1},(2)ΓCRS={δ|δ≥0},(3)ΓNIRS={δ|0≤δ≤1},(4)ΓNDRS={δ|δ≥1}.Here, VRS, CRS, NIRS, and NDRS stand for Variable, Constant, Nonincreasing, and Nondecreasing RTS, respectively.Considering DMUo(o ∈ J) as the unit under assessment, the input-oriented and output-oriented FDH radial efficiency measures of DMUo=(xo,yo)are obtained by solving the following mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems, respectively:(5)θoΓ=minθs.t.∑j∈Jλjxj≤θxo,∑j∈Jλjyj≥yo,λj=δωj,ωj∈{0,1};j∈J,δ∈Γ,∑j∈Jωj=1,(6)φoΓ=maxφs.t.∑j∈Jλjxj≤xo,∑j∈Jλjyj≥φyo,λj=δωj,ωj∈{0,1};j∈J,δ∈Γ,∑j∈Jωj=1,where Γ ∈ {CRS, VRS, NIRS, NDRS}.The DMUois called input-oriented FDH-efficient (corresponding to the Γ set used) ifθoΓ=1.Also, DMUois called output-oriented FDH-efficient (corresponding to the Γ set used) ifφoΓ=1.The above models and Γ-technologies have been proposed by Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999). A linear version of these models has been addressed by Podinovski (2004). These models and technologies have been utilized by Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Soleimani-damaneh and Mostafaee (2009) for determining RTS under nonconvex production technologies.Obtaining FDH efficiency scores using Models (5) and (6) requires solving linear/nonlinear mixed-integer programming problems. The following proposition shows that these models can be solved by calculating only some simple ratios. The proof of this proposition comes from the discussions provided by Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Kerstens and Woestyne (2014), and is hence omitted.Proposition 2.1For o, j ∈ J, defineλjo=maxr{yroyrj},λjo=mini{xioxij}.We haveθoΓ={minj∈J:yj≥yo{maxi{xijxio}},forΓ=VRSminj∈J{maxi{xijλjoxio}},forΓ=CRSminj∈J:λjo≤1{maxi{xijλjoxio}},forΓ=NIRSminj∈J:λjo≥1{maxi{xijλjoxio}},forΓ=NDRSφoΓ={maxj∈J:xj≤xo{minr{yrjyro}},forΓ=VRSmaxj∈J{minr{yrjλjoyro}},forΓ=CRSmaxj∈J:λjo≤1{minr{yrjλjoyro}},forΓ=NIRSmaxj∈J:λjo≥1{minr{yrjλjoyro}},forΓ=NDRSFrom Proposition 2.1, it can be seen that the FDH efficiency scores can be obtained by calculating only some ratios. Calculating these ratios is polynomial-time computationally; see Theorem 3 in Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007).Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme units, studying (identifying) the extreme units plays a crucial role in finding the anchor points. In fact, the set of extreme units is called the frame of PPS. In this section, a basic definition of extreme units in non-convex technologies is given. Afterward, a method for identification of the extreme units in FDH technologies, under various RTS assumptions, is presented.Definition 3.1Let PΓbe the FDH production possibility set under consideration. For o ∈ J, definePoΓ={(x,y):∑j∈J∖{o}λjxj≤x,∑j∈J∖{o}λjyj≥y≥0,λj=δωj;j∈J∖{o},∑j∈J∖{o}ωj=1,ω∈({0,1})n−1,δ∈Γ},as the PPS obtained by removing DMUo=(xo,yo)from{DMU1,…,DMUn}. The unit under assessment, DMUo, is called an extreme unit in PΓ, if(xo,yo)∉PoΓ.In fact, a DMU is an extreme unit if removing it from the set of the observed DMUs does change the PPS. The following example clarifies the above definition.Hereafter, the set of extreme units in PΓis denoted by EΓ.Example 3.1Consider five DMUs, A, B, C, D, E which consume a single-input x to produce a single-output y. The data of these DMUs are listed in Table 1.The frontier of the PPS under different RTS assumptions can be seen in Fig. 1. The frontier in VRS case has been depicted by the dark line segments. The frontier under CRS assumption is the halfline starting from the origin passing from point A. The frontier in NIRS case is the union of the halfline{C+λ(1,0)T:λ≥0}withOA¯∪AG¯∪GD¯∪DH¯∪HC¯. Moreover, the frontier under NDRS assumption is the union of the line segmentAF¯and the halfline{A+λ(1,1)T:λ≥0}(recall that superscript “T” stands for transpose).From Fig. 1, it is seen thatEVRS={A,B,C,D},ECRS={A},ENIRS={A,C,D},andENDRS={A}.Now, we consider the following integer programming problem to provide a method for obtaining the extreme units in FDH technologies:(7)λoΓ=minλos.t.∑j=1j≠onλjxij+λoxio≤xio,i=1,…,m∑j=1j≠onλjyrj+λoyro≥yro,r=1,…,s∑j=1j≠onωj+ωo=1,λj=δωj,j=1,…,n,ωj∈{0,1},j=1,…,n,δ∈Γ.Theorem 3.1(i)DMUois an extreme unit in PΓ if and only if the optimal value of Model(7)is equal to one (i.e.λoΓ=1).DMUois not an extreme unit in PΓ if and only if the optimal value of Model(7)is equal to zero (i.e.λoΓ=0).Part (i): By contradiction assume that DMUois not an extreme unit, then(xo,yo)∈PoΓ.Hence, there exists a vector(λ¯,ω¯,δ¯)∈Rn×({0,1})n×Rwhich is a feasible solution to Problem (7) withλ¯o=ω¯o=0.Thus,λoΓ≤0. On the other hand, λo≥ 0 in all feasible solutions of Problem (7). Therefore,λoΓ=0. This contradicts the assumption.To prove the converse of part (i), by contradiction assume thatλoΓ≠1. Since(ωo=λo=1,ωj=λj=0;j≠o,δ=1)is a feasible solution to Problem (7), we haveλoΓ≤1. On the other hand,λoΓ≥0. If0<λoΓ<1,then by the third and fourth constraints of Problem (7), we getωo*=1,λo*=δ*,λj*=ωj*=0;j≠oin any optimal solution of this problem (the superscript “*” stands for optimality). Hence, by the first and second constraints of Problem (7), we get δ*xo≤ xoand δ*yo≥ yo. These implyδ*=1which leads toλoΓ=λo*=1and makes a contradiction. Therefore,λoΓ=0. This implies that(xo,yo)∈PoΓand hence DMUois not an extreme unit.The proof of part (ii) is similar to that of part (i), and is hence omitted.□Model (7) is a 0–1 nonlinear mixed-integer programming problem which belongs to the NP-hard class in general. According to the special structure of this problem, the following theorem provides a practical formula for checking if a DMUois an extreme unit in PΓor not. Checking it by this formula is polynomial-time computationally (see Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi, 2007). It is done without solving any mathematical programming problem.Theorem 3.2Let λjo and λjo be as defined inProposition 2.1. Then we have(i)λjo> 1 or λjo< 1 for each j ≠ o, if and only if DMUois an extreme unit in PVRS.λjo> λjo for each j ≠ o, if and only if DMUois an extreme unit in PCRS.λjo> 1 or λjo> λjo for each j ≠ o, if and only if DMUois an extreme unit in PNIRS.λjo< 1 or λjo> λjo for each j ≠ o, if and only if DMUois an extreme unit in PNDRS.We prove only part (ii); and the proof of the other parts is similar to that of this part.The proof of part (ii): Assume thatλko≤λkofor some k ≠ o. Considerλ¯k∈[λko,λko]. Hencemaxr{yroyrk}=λko≤λ¯k≤λko=mini{xioxik}.Therefore,λ¯kyrk≥yro;∀r=1,2,…,s,λ¯kxik≤xio;∀i=1,2,…,m.Thus(ωk=1,ωj=0;j≠k,λk=λ¯k,λj=0;j≠k,δ=λ¯k)is a feasible solution to Problem (7) withΓ=CRS,in whichλo=0. Therefore, the optimal value of Problem (7) withΓ=CRSis zero. Hence, DMUois not an extreme unit in PCRS according to Theorem 3.1.Conversely, assume that DMUois not an extreme unit in PCRS. By Theorem 3.1,λo*=0in all optimal solutions of Problem (7) withΓ=CRS. Hence, by the fourth constraint of this problem, we getωo*=0.Therefore, by the third and fourth constraints of the problem, there exists some j ≠ o such thatωj*=1andλjxij≤xio;∀i=1,2,…,m,λjyrj≥yro;∀r=1,2,…,s.Henceλjo=maxr{yroyrj}≤λj≤λjo=mini{xioxij}.This implies λjo≤ λjofor some j ≠ o, which contradicts the assumption and completes the proof of part (ii).□Now we implement the above theorem on the data of Example 3.1. We do it only for VRS and CRS cases, and for other cases it can be done similarly.The λjoand λjovalues for o, j ∈ {A, B, C, D, E} have been calculated and listed in Tables 2and 3, respectively. In these tables, row is corresponding to “o” and column is corresponding to “j”.For each o ∈ {A, B, C, D}, we have λjo> 1 or λjo< 1 for each j ≠ o (see the rows corresponding to A, B, C, D in Tables 2 and 3). Hence, four DMUs A, B, C, D are extreme units in PVRS, because of part (i) of Theorem 3.2. DMUEis not extreme in PVRS becauseλAE=1andλAE=6>1.Now, letΓ=CRS. For DMUA, λjA> λjAfor each j ≠ A. Hence, DMUAis an extreme unit in PCRS because of part (ii) of Theorem 3.2. For DMUB,λDB=0.43<λDB=0.6,and hence this unit is not extreme in PCRS. For three DMUs C, D, E, we haveλAC=4<λAC=8,λAD=3.5<λAD=5,andλAE=1<λAE=6. Hence, these three DMUs are not extreme units in PCRS.As can be seen in the DEA literature (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2012), the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and application. These points delineate the efficient frontier of the PPS from the free-disposability portion of the boundary (in convex DEA). The anchor points are usually production points with small or big size of input-output factors. These points are far from the central part of the efficiency frontier. As can be seen from Theorem 1 of Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014) and the results given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), the role of some input–output factors in efficiency situation of these units is not considerable. Anchor points were first used by Thanassoulis and Allen (1998). More developments about the anchor points from both conceptual and applied points of view have been done by Bougnol (2001), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), Thanassoulis et al. (2012), and Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014).Now, we are ready to define the anchor points in nonconvex DEA models which are called FDH models. LetEΓdenote the set of extreme units inPΓ. An approach for obtainingEΓwas provided in the previous section. The following definition introduces the concept of anchor points inPΓ; see Bougnol and Dulá (2009).Definition 4.1LetDMUo=(xo,yo)be the unit under assessment. This DMU is called an anchor point inPΓif(xo,yo)∈EΓand some component of inputs can be increased infinitely or some component of outputs can be decreased until zero without penetrating the interior ofPΓ.Due to the above definition, whenDMUo=(xo,yo)is an anchor point, some component of inputs can be increased infinitely or some component of outputs can be decreased until zero while the new point remains on the frontier of PPS.The following lemma helps us in the sequel. Throughout this work, int(A) stands for the set of interior points of A. Also, e denotes a vector with all components equal to one.Lemma 4.1LetAΓ:={(x,y):∑j∈Jλjxj<x,∑j∈Jλjyj>y>0,λj=δωj;j∈J,∑j∈Jωj=1,ω∈({0,1})n,δ∈Γ}.Then we haveint(PΓ)=AΓ,where Γ ∈ {VRS, CRS, NIRS, NDRS}.Let (x0, y0) ∈ int(PΓ). Then there exist scalarsβ,ϵ>0such that(x0,y0−βe)∈PΓand(x0−ϵe,y0+ϵe)∈PΓ.Hence(8)(x0,y0−βe)∈PΓ⟹y0−βe≥0⟹y0>0.Furthermore, by(x0−ϵe,y0+ϵe)∈PΓ,there are vectorsλ¯∈Rnandω¯∈({0,1})nand scalarδ¯∈Γsuch that(9)∑j∈Jλ¯jxj≤x0−ϵe<x0,∑j∈Jλ¯jyj≥y0+ϵe>y0,λ¯j=δ¯ω¯j,∑j∈Jω¯j=1.By (8) and (9), we have(x0,y0)∈AΓ.Thusint(PΓ)⊆AΓ.Conversely, assume that(x¯,y¯)∈AΓ. Thus there exist an index j ∈ J and a scalarδ¯∈Γsuch thatδ¯xj<x¯,δ¯yj>y¯>0.Setɛ:=min{mini{x¯i−δ¯xij2},minr{δ¯yrj−y¯r2},minr{y¯r2}}.Hence, for each i,ɛ<x¯i−δ¯xij⟹δ¯xij<x¯i−ɛ.Also, for each r,ɛ<δ¯yrj−y¯r⟹δ¯yrj>y¯r+ɛ,ɛ<y¯r.To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show thatB((x¯,y¯);ɛ)⊆PΓ,whereB((x¯,y¯);ɛ)denotes the open ball with center(x¯,y¯)and radius ε. Let(x,y)∈B((x¯,y¯);ɛ).Then, for each i, we get|xi−x¯i|≤∥(x,y)−(x¯,y¯)∥<ɛwhich impliesx¯i−ɛ<xi.Hence(10)δ¯xij<x¯i−ɛ<xi,∀i.Furthermore, for each r, we get|yr−y¯r|≤∥(x,y)−(x¯,y¯)∥<ɛwhich implies−ɛ+y¯r<yr<y¯r+ɛ.Hence(11)δ¯yrj>y¯r+ɛ>yr,∀r,and(12)yr>−ɛ+y¯r>0,∀r.By (10)–(12), we have(x,y)∈PΓ,and this completes the proof.□The following theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for checking ifDMUo(xo,yo)∈EΓis an anchor point or not. Lemma 4.1 plays a vital role in the proof of Theorem 4.1.Hereafter, ejdenotes the jth unit vector.Theorem 4.1DMUo(xo,yo)∈EΓis an anchor point inPΓ,if and only if none of the following systems has a solution:(i)(13)∑j∈Jλjxij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,i≠p,∑j∈Jλjyrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,λj=δωj,ωj∈{0,1};j∈J,δ∈Γ,∑j∈Jωj=1,for somep∈{1,2,…,m},(14)∑j∈Jλjxij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,∑j∈Jλjyrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,r≠q,λj=δωj,ωj∈{0,1};j∈J,δ∈Γ,∑j∈Jωj=1,for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.By indirect proof, assume that system (13) has a solution(λ¯,ω¯,δ¯)for somep∈{1,2,…,m}. Therefore, there exists some M > 0 such that(15)∑j∈Jλ¯jxij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,i≠p,∑j∈Jλ¯jxpj<xpo+M,∑j∈Jλ¯jyrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,λ¯j=δ¯ω¯j,ω¯j∈{0,1};j∈J,δ¯∈Γ,∑j∈Jω¯j=1.Hence, according to Lemma 4.1, we have(xo+Mep,yo)∈int(PΓ).This implies thatDMUo∈EΓis not an anchor point due to Definition 4.1. The proof for the case that system (14) has a solution for someq∈{1,2,…,s}is similar.Conversely, assume thatDMUo∈EΓis not an anchor point. Then, according to Definition 4.1, there exists somep∈{1,2,…,m}or someq∈{1,2,…,s}such that(x0+Mep,y0)∈int(PΓ)or(x0,y0−Meq)∈int(PΓ)for some M > 0. Without loss of generality, we consider somep∈{1,2,…,m}and some M > 0 satisfying(x0+Mep,y0)∈int(PΓ). Hence, by Lemma 4.1, there exists a vector(λ¯,ω¯,δ¯)satisfying system (15). Clearly,(λ¯,ω¯,δ¯)satisfies system (13). This contradiction completes the proof.□Regarding Theorem 4.1, for checking “whetherDMUo=(xo,yo)is an anchor point or not” we should check the feasibility of nonlinear mixed-integer linear systems (13) and (14). The following theorem shows that it can be done by calculating some simple ratios without solving mixed-integer systems (13) and (14).Theorem 4.2Letp∈{1,2,…,m},q∈{1,2,…,s},andj∈{1,2,…,n}. Defineμpjo=mini:i≠p{xioxij},μjoq=maxr:r≠q{yroyrj},λjo=maxr{yroyrj},λjo=mini{xioxij}.Then we have(i)(xo, yo) ∈ EVRSis not an anchor point in PVRSif and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that one of the following conditions hold:(A)λjo< 1 andμpjo>1for somep∈{1,2,…,m},λjo> 1 andμjoq<1for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.(xo, yo) ∈ ECRSis not an anchor point in PCRSif and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that one of the following conditions hold:(C)λjo<μpjofor somep∈{1,2,…,m},μjoq<λjofor someq∈{1,2,…,s}.(xo, yo) ∈ ENIRSis not an anchor point in PNIRSif and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that one of the following conditions hold:(E)λjo<μpjoand λjo< 1 for somep∈{1,2,…,m},μjoq<λjoandμjoq<1for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.(xo, yo) ∈ ENDRSis not an anchor point in PNDRSif and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that one of the following conditions hold:(G)λjo<μpjoandμpjo>1for somep∈{1,2,…,m},μjoq<λjoand λjo> 1 for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.(i)By Theorem 4.1, (xo, yo) ∈ EVRS is not an anchor point in PVRS if and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that one of the following systems is feasible{xij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,i≠p,yrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,for somep∈{1,2,…,m},or{xij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,yrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,r≠q,for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.Clearly, it holds if and only if there exists somej∈{1,2,…,n}such that (A) or (B) holds. This completes the proof of part (i).By Theorem 4.1, (xo, yo) ∈ ECRS is not an anchor point in PCRS if and only if there exist somej∈{1,2,…,n}and some λj≥ 0 such that{λjxij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,i≠p,λjyrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,for somep∈{1,2,…,m},or{λjxij<xio,i=1,2,…,m,λjyrj>yro,r=1,2,…,s,r≠q,for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.It holds if and only if there exist somej∈{1,2,…,n}and some λj≥ 0 such thatmini:i≠p{xioxij}>λj>maxr{yroyrj},for somep∈{1,2,…,m},ormini{xioxij}>λj>maxr:r≠q{yroyrj},for someq∈{1,2,…,s}.It holds if and only if (C) or (D) holds; and this completes the proof of Part (ii).The proof of parts (iii) and (iv) is similar to that of parts (i) and (ii) and is hence omitted.11It is worth mentioning that the idea of the proof of this theorem is taken from the discussion provided in Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Kerstens and Woestyne (2014).□The following algorithm, which is obtained from the theoretical results of the paper, provides a ratio-based procedure for checking whether a DMU is anchor point or not. It is done via calculating some simple ratios, and similar to Theorem 3 in Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), it can be shown that the provided algorithm is polynomial-time computationally.We write the algorithm only for VRS case. It can be written for other cases analogously.Algorithm 1is also presented in Flowchart 1. This flowchart is helpful in better understanding the algorithm.Now, we perform the provided algorithm on an example with real world data.Example 4.1Assume that we have 17 DMUs which consume two inputs x1j, x2jto produce two outputs y1j, y2j. The data of this example, listed in Table 4, have been extracted from a real application reported by Hadi-vencheh, Foroughi, and Soleimani-damaneh (2008). Here, we assume thatΓ=VRS. From the results reported in the sixth and seventh columns of Table 4, it is seen that two DMUs 1 and 2 are anchor points in PVRS and the remaining units are not anchor. The reasons which make DMUs 3–17 non-anchor has been written in the last column of this table. Three DMUs 5, 6 and 16 are non-extreme units in PVRS.The λ- and μ-values for DMU1 have been reported in Table 5. From Table 5, it is seen that λjo< 1 for each j ≠ 1. Hence, by Theorem 3.2, DMU1 is an extreme unit in PVRS. Furthermore, in Table 5,(∄(j,p);λjo<1,μpjo>1)&(∄(j,q);λjo>1,μjoq<1).Thus, DMU1 is an anchor point in PVRS, because of Theorem 4.2. Similarly, it can be shown that DMU2 is an anchor point in PVRS.There are two equivalent views in defining the anchor points in convex technologies. Based upon the first view, anchor points are extreme points that give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the weak-efficient portion of the boundary of the PPS. In second view, an extreme point is called anchor if some component of inputs (resp. outputs) can be increased infinitely (resp. decreased until zero) without penetrating the interior of the PPS. Both these standpoints work and these are equivalent under the convexity of PPS, while the former is not valid for FDH technologies; see e.g. DMUCin Fig. 1 (in VRS case). Some approaches given in the literature (Thanassoulis et al., 2012) work based upon the former view and so they do not work for nonconvex case. The equivalence of the above-mentioned definitions in convex technologies accompanying some results from duality in linear programming and convex analysis, lead to an important characterization of anchor points with respect to the supporting hyperplanes (see Result 1 in Bougnol & Dulá, 2009 and its proof) and to some algorithms for convex case (see Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014). This characterization and the related algorithms do not work in nonconvex case due to the lack of duality relations, lack of supporting hyperplanes at some boundary points and inequivalence of two above-mentioned definitions.In addition to the above comments, the first step in studying anchor points in a technology is defining the extreme points (units). In convex analysis and linear programming, extreme points are defined utilizing convex combination. Such a definition does not work in the presence of nonconvex production technologies, and hence the methods existing in convex DEA literature do not work for nonconvex PPSs. According to this, we have provided a new definition of extreme units (Definition 3.1) which is compatible with nonconvex technologies.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
FDH models are important nonconvex DEA models which rely on the sole assumption that production possibilities satisfy free disposability, and ensure that efficiency evaluations are effected from only actually observed performances; see Deprins et al. (1984), Tulkens (1993), Kerstens and Woestyne (2014), Cherchye et al. (2000), 2001), and Soleimani-damaneh (2013). On the other hand, anchor points, which define the transition from the efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the frontier of the convex PPS, build an important class of extreme efficient points in DEA. Although the properties, applications, and identification of these points in convex DEA models have been studied by various authors (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2012), there is not any work about these points on nonconvex technologies in the literature. In this paper, we dealt with these points from a different point of view in FDH models, and provided some main theorems for characterization of these points. Utilizing these theoretical results, a polynomial-time procedure has been introduced for identification of the anchor points. The connection between the anchor points and super-efficiency models (see Andersen & Petersen, 1993; Chen, 2005; Tone, 2002) seems as a worthwhile direction for future research. An obvious link can be observed by comparing Definition 3.1 in the present paper and the model given by Andersen and Petersen (1993).
