@&#ABSTRACT@&#
There are three species of the genus Mesembryanthemum recorded in Egyptian flora (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L., Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum L. and Mesembryanthemum forsskaolii Hochst. ex Bioss.). Various genetic markers (SDS-PAGE, RAPD and ISSR) have been applied to evaluate the genetic variability and structure within and between twelve populations of Egyptian Mesembryanthemum L. species collected from different localities along the International Coastal Road. The electrophoretic analysis of protein was revealed 18 bands of molecular weight ranging from 11.6 to 104.6 KDa. Five RAPD markers generated 39 total bands. The percentage of polymorphism ranged from 25% to 75%, with an average 61.78%. A total of five ISSR primers produced 37 total bands and the percentage of polymorphism ranged from 25% to 55.5%, with an average 40.77%. Results of AMOVA analysis showed that the percentages of molecular variance within populations are 73%, 77% and 53% and among species populations were scored as 27%, 23% and 47% using SDS-PAGE, RAPD and ISSR markers respectively. The results of the study revealed that M. crystallinum and M. nodiflorum exhibited within range genetic diversity. RAPD and ISSR markers exhibited lower genetic diversity for M. forsskaolii. Comparing with native species at local scale, M. crystallinum and M. nodiflorum had lower genetic diversity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae, comprises the single genus Mesembryanthemum, with 102 species [1]. The genus comprises about 70 species and it is native to the Mediterranean region, Atlantic Islands, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Australia and California [2]. Three species of the genus Mesembryanthemum are recorded in Egyptian flora (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L., Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum L. and Mesembryanthemum forsskaolii Hochst. ex Bioss.)According to El-Shayeb et al. [3], M. crystallinum grows in sandy and loamy habitats near the sea that are characterized by high soil moisture, moderate rainfall and temperature. M. forsskaolii grows in habitats of sandy plains or slopes that are characterized by low rainfall and high temperature. M. nodiflorum grows in wide ecological amplitude in sandy habitats that are characterized by low rainfall, high temperature and silty and loamy habitats with moderate rainfall and temperature. M. crystallinum and M. nodiflorum may grow in salty soil while, M. forsskaolii grows in the soil with low salinity.Several studies have investigated Aizoaceae species such as M. crystallinum which has many biological activities (e.g. antioxidant, antiviral and antimicrobial) [4–6]. M. crystallinum may be also useful for bio-remediation due to its salt accumulation property [7]. M. forsskaolii seeds were ground into flour used as a replacement for wheat for bread and cookies due to containing high protein content [8]. Moreover, M. nodiflorum as well as M. crystallinum were used as food and in Tunisian traditional medicine for treatments of ocular infection [9], making these three species good candidates for pharmaceutical or cosmetical applications.The primary concern in population and evolutionary genetic studies is to assess and evaluate the genetic variation that it provides the basis for any evolutionary change. The methods for estimating genetic diversity have been progressed over the years from Mendelian analyses of morphological traits, to statistical characterization of quantitative characters, to variants biochemical electrophoretic assays and, recently, to molecular estimations of DNA sequence variation [10].The application of molecular genetics methods for assessing genetic diversity has been a significantly increased. They have been applied to increase our knowledge of the structure and extent of genetic variation within and among species [11]. Several laboratory techniques had been developed including protein methods such as isozyme electrophoresis or molecular methods such as DNA analysis giving a high indication of the levels of genetic variation found in a species or population without direct interference from environmental factors [11,12].Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is one of the DNA techniques which can detect the polymorphism in closely related organism [13]. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-PCR marker is also highly polymorphic and is useful in studies on genetic diversity, genome mapping, phylogeny, evolutionary biology, and population and conservation genetics [14,15]. Unlike allozymes which are codominant markers, RAPD and ISSR are dominant markers [11].In the present study, molecular analysis (RAPD and ISSR) was applied beside biochemical analysis (SDS-PAGE) to assess genetic variation within and among Egyptian Mesembryanthemum species growing naturally in different coastal regions of Egypt.Plant samples were collected from twelve natural populations of three Mesembryanthemum species representing different localities along the International Coastal Road as listed in Table 1and represented in Fig. 1. M. crystallinum L. and M. nodiflorum L. populations were collected from five localities (Port said, Demiatta, El-Dakahlia, Kafr El-sheikh and El-Beheira), while M. forsskaolii Hochst. ex Bioss. populations were collected from two localities only (El-Gamil and Port said city). The number of sampled populations depended on the actual population size. Seeds and fresh young leaves were collected as bulked samples from each population of each species in the study area for genetic analyses.Sodium dedocylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophorosis (SDS-PAGE) as described by Laemmli [16] was used to differentiate between twelve populations of studied M. crystallinum, M. forsskaolii and M. nodiflorum seeds by their protein profiles. It is the standard method for separating and differentiating protein according to their molecular weights. The banding profile in the gel was photographed and the number of bands for each taxon was scored.Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified protocol of Dellaporta [17]. The amount of DNA was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA samples were stored at −20 °C for RAPD and ISSR analyses.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted according to Williams et al. [13]. Twelve RAPD primers were initially screened but only five primers (OPO9, OPO10, OPO11, OPO12 and OPO13) were used in the analysis and listed in Table 3. The generated clear and reproducible banding patterns were used to evaluate genetic diversity. The reaction conditions were optimized and mixtures were composed of dNTPs (5 μl), MgCl2 (5 μl), 10× buffer, primer (5 μl), DNA (10 μl), promega Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units). DNA amplification was carried out in a thermocycler (PTC-100) programmed for 95 °C for 5 min (one cycle); followed by 94 °C for 1 min, 36 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min (45 cycle); 72 °C for 5 min (one cycle), then 4 °C (infinitive). Amplification products (10 μl) were mixed with 5 μl bromophenol blue separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with 3 μl ethidium bromide then photographed.ISSR-PCR reactions were conducted according to Zietkiewicz et al. [18] using five selective ISSR primers for the genotypes as (HB11, HB12, HB13, HB14 and HB15) which were synthesized on an ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) at AGERI, ARC (Egypt) and represented in Table 3. DNA amplification was carried out in Stratgene PCR 96 which was programmed for denaturation (one cycle) at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles: as follows 94 °C for 30 s, 44 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally one cycle extension at 72 °C for 20 min, and 4 °C (infinitive). Fifteen μl of PCR-products were resolved in 1.5% GTG agarose gel electrophoresis with 1× TAE running buffer. The run was performed at 80 V for 180 min and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide then photographed.The gels of DNA and protein were visualized and photographed by gel documentation system (Biometra Bio Doc Analyze 2000) under UV transilluminator at central laboratory of Desert Research Center. The bands were scored as present (1) or absent (0) regardless of their intensity. Only the clear and reproducible bands were recorded. The smeared and weak ones were excluded from analysis. The binary data generated were used to estimate levels of polymorphism by dividing the polymorphic bands by the total number of scored bands.Using GenAlEX 6.2 [19], standard measures of genetic diversity for each species were calculated including the number of different alleles (Na), the number of effective alleles (Ne) = 1/(p2 + q2), Shannon's information index (SI) = −1(p Ln (p) + q Ln(q)), the expected heterozygosity (He) = 2pq, the unbiased expected heterozygosity (UHe) = (2N/(2N−1)) He, and percentage of polymorphic loci (%P). All the measurements were assessed and represented as mean and standard error (SE) over loci within populations and over loci among populations within the species [20]. The genetic differences (PhiPT) among species were estimated using the Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) procedure [21] to investigate the hierarchical partitioning of genetic variation among species. PhiPT was calculated as the proportion of the variance among species, relative to the total variance. Unbiased genetic identity and distance [23] were calculated between pairs of species using GenAlEX 6.2 [22].
