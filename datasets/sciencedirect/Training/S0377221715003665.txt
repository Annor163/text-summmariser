@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ouyang et al. (2009) consider an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity. Basically, their inventory model is practical, but there are some defects from the logical viewpoints of mathematics. In this paper, the functional behaviors of the annual total relevant costs are explored by rigorous methods of mathematics. A complete solution procedure is also developed to make up for the shortcomings of Ouyang et al. (2009). In numerical examples, it is proved that the new solution procedure could avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In practice, suppliers usually offer some credit periods to the retailers in order to stimulate the demand for the products they produce. Within the allowable delay period, they do not charge any interest on the outstanding amount if the retailers settle the account with them. Stokes (2005) indicates that trade credit represents one of the most flexible sources of short-term financing available to firms principally because it arises spontaneously with the purchase of customers. In addition, trade credit brings some economic advantage to the retailers as they earn some interest from the revenue realized during the period of permissible delay.Haley and Higgins (1973) introduce the first model to consider the economic order quantity (EOQ) model under conditions of permissible delay in payments. From different viewpoints, Goyal (1985) develops the EOQ model when the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments. Adopting the viewpoints of Goyal (1985), Chang, Teng, and Goyal (2008) propose a review article about the inventory lot-size models under trade credit.Recently, two additional problems for inventory models under trade credit have been studied extensively by many researchers. One considers that the supplier offers the retailer a permissible delay in payments depending on the order quantity. The other considers deteriorating items in such inventory models, in which deterioration refers to the damage, spoilage, dryness, vaporization, etc. of the products. Research on the inventory problems for deteriorating items is started by Whitin (1957), who considers fashion goods deteriorating at the end of a prescribed storage period. An exponentially decaying inventory was developed first by Ghare and Schrader (1963). The details could be found in the review articles of Nahmias (1982), Raafat (1991), and Goyal and Giri (2001).Khouja and Mehrez (1996) first discuss the problem that the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments only when the order quantity is larger than a predetermined quantity. Chang, Ouyang, and Teng (2003) establish an EOQ model for deteriorating items, in which the supplier provides a permissible delay for the purchaser if the order quantity is greater than or equal to a predetermined quantity. Related articles include Chung and Liao (2004, 2006), Chung, Goyal, and Huang (2005), Liao (2007), Chung (2009), and Chang, Ouyang, Teng, and Cheng (2010). Furthermore, Huang (2007) considers the case of conditionally permissible delay to assume that the supplier offers a partially permissible delay in payments if the order quantity is less than a predetermined quantity. Yang (2010) further adopts the concept of Huang (2007) to consider the inventory models for deteriorating items in discounted cash flow analysis under alternatives of conditionally permissible delay in payments and cash discount.Ouyang, Teng, Goyal, and Yang (2009) incorporate the concepts of Ghare and Schrader (1963), Goyal (1985), Khouja and Mehrez (1996), and Huang (2007) to consider an economic order quantity model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity. Their inventory model is practical. However, they do not explore the functional behaviors such as the continuity, decrease, increase, and convexity of the annual total relevant costs. The solution procedure has some defects from the logical viewpoints of mathematics. This paper intends to make up for the shortcomings of Ouyang et al. (2009) by rigorous mathematical methods. A complete solution procedure is also proposed to avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties.The following notation and assumptions are used in the whole paper.Notation:Dthe annual demandthe ordering cost per orderthe quantity at which the fully delayed payment permitted per orderthe purchasing cost per unitthe unit holding cost per year excluding interest chargethe selling price per unitthe interest earned per dollar per yearthe interest charged per dollar in stocks per yearthe period of permissible delay in settling accountsthe fraction of the delayed payments permitted by the supplier per order, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1the deterioration rate, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1the replenishment cycle time in yearsthe order quantitythe annual total relevant cost, which is a function of Tthe optimal replenishment cycle time of TRC(T)belongs toReplenishments are instantaneous.Demand rate, D, is known and constant.Shortages are not allowed.The inventory system involves only one type of inventory.Time horizon is infinite.If Q ≥ W, then fully delayed payment is permitted. The retailer pays cQ after M time periods from the time the order is filled. Otherwise, a partially delayed payment is permitted. Hence, if Q < W, i.e.T < W/D, the retailer must first make a partial payment to the supplier,(1−α)cDT, when the order is filled. And the remaining balances, αcDT, would be paid off at the end of the trade credit period.During the time period when the account is not settled, generated sales revenue is deposited in an interest-bearing account.Ik≥ Ie.The inventory level decreases owing to demand as well as deterioration. Thus, the change of inventory level can be represented by the following differential equation:(1)dI(t)dt+θI(t)=−D,0<t<T,with the boundary conditionI(T)=0. The solution of Eq. (1) is(2)I(t)=Dθ[eθ(T−t)−1],0≤t≤T.Hence, the order quantity for each cycle is(3)Q=I(0)=Dθ(eθT−1).By the similar argument, we can obtain the time interval that W units are depleted to zero due to both demand and deterioration as(4)TW=1θln(θDW+1).If Q ≥ W (i.e. T ≥ TW), then fully delayed payment is permitted. Otherwise, a partially delayed payment is permitted. Hence, if Q < W ( i.e. T < TW), then the retailer must take a loan (with the interest charged of Ik) to pay the supplier the partial payment of(1−α)cQwhen the order is filled at time 0. From the constant sales revenue pD, the retailer will be able to pay off the loan(1−α)cQat time(1−α)(c/p)(eθT−1)/θ.Note that if the payoff time of the partial payment at(1−α)(c/p)(eθT−1)/θis shorter than or equal to the permissible delay M, thenT≤T0≡1θln(θpM(1−α)c+1), and vice versa. Ouyang et al. (2009) assume(5)T0>M.Consequently, based on the values of M, TW, and T0, we have three possible cases: (1) T0 > M ≥ TW, (2) T0 ≥ TW> M, and (3) TW> T0 > M.Case 1T0 > M ≥ TW.Ouyang et al. (2009) reveal that the annual total relevant cost for the retailer in Case 1 can be expressed as(6)TRC(T)={TRC1(T),ifM≤T,(a)TRC2(T),ifTW≤T≤M,(b)TRC3(T),if0<T<TW,(c)where(7)TRC1(T)=AT+(cθ+h)Dθ2T(eθT−θT−1)+cIkDθ2T[eθ(T−M)−θ(T−M)−1]−pIeDM22T(8)TRC2(T)=AT+(cθ+h)Dθ2T(eθT−θT−1)−pIeD(M−T2)(9)TRC3(T)=AT+(cθ+h)Dθ2T(eθT−θT−1)+cIk(c/p)(1−α)2D2θ2T(eθT−1)2−pIeD2T[T−(1−α)(c/p)(eθT−1)/θ]2−pIeD(M−T)T[T−(1−α)(c/p)(eθT−1)/θ].Eqs.

(21) implies(i)f3(T) is increasing on T > 0.f3(T)>f3(0)=0.Both (i) and (ii) conclude that (E) and (F) hold.(G) and (H): See the proof of Lemma 2(E) in Chung (2011).(I) and (J): See the proof of Lemma 2 in Chung (2000).(K) Letg(T)=6θTe2θT−e2θT−8θTeθT+2eθT−1+2θT.Theng′(T)=4θe2θT+12θ2Te2θT−8θeθT−8θ2TeθT+2θeθT+2θ=12θ2Te2θT−8θ2TeθT+4θe2θT−6θeθT+2θ.Letk(T)=4θe2θT−6θeθT+2θ.We havek′(T)=8θ2e2θT−6θ2eθT>0.Consequently, k(T) is increasing on T > 0, andk(T)>k(0)=0ifT>0.Hence,g′(T)>0.g(T)isincreasingonT>0.So,g(T)>g(0)=0ifT>0.This completes the proof of Lemma 1(K).Combining the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Lemma 1.By Lemma 1, we could explore the functional behaviors of the annual total relevant costs in each case.T0 > M ≥ TW.From Eqs. (7)–(9), we can find the first-order and second-order derivatives ofTRCi(T)(i=1,2,3). Also, by Lemma 1(D, F), we can prove the convexity ofTRCi(T)(i=2,3).(22)TRC′1(T)=−AT2+(cθ+h)D(θTeθT−eθT−1)θ2T2+cIkD[θTeθ(T−M)−eθ(T−M)−θM+1]θ2T2+pIeDM22T2,(23)TRC′′1(T)=2AT3+D(cθ+h)θ2T3(θ2T2eθT−2θTeθT+2eθT−2)+cIkDθ2T3(θ2T2eθ(T−M)−2θTeθ(T−M)+2eθ(T−M)+2θM−2)−pIeDM2T3,(24)TRC′2(T)=−AT2+(cθ+h)D(θTeθT−eθT+1)θ2T2+pIeD2,(25)TRC′′2(T)=2AT3+D(cθ+h)θ2T3(θ2T2eθT−2θTeθT+2eθT−2)>0,(26)TRC′3(T)=−AT2+[D(cθ+h)+θIeDc(1−α)M]θ2T2(θTeθT−eθT+1)+(c2/p)(Ik−Ie)(1−α)2D2θ2T2(eθT−1)(2θTeθT−eθT+1)+pIeD2,(27)TRC′′3(T)=2AT3+[D(cθ+h)+θIeDc(1−α)Mθ2T3]×(θ2T2eθT−2θTeθT+2eθT−2)+(c2/p)(Ik−Ie)(1−α)2D2θ2×[4θ2T2e2θT−2θ2T2eθT−2(eθT−1)(2θTeθT−eθT+1)]T3>0.Lemma 1(B), Eqs.

We also have that TRC1(T) is decreasing on (0, T1] and increasing on [T1, ∞).(i)If Δ2 > 0, then TRC2(T) is increasing on [TW, ∞).If Δ2 ≤ 0 < Δ1, then T2 ∈ [TW, M). We also have that TRC2(T) is decreasing on [TW, T2] and increasing on [T2, M].If Δ1 ≤ 0, then TRC2(T) is decreasing on [TW, M].(i)If Δ3 > 0, then T3 ∈ (0, TW). We also have that TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, T3] and increasing on [T3, TW).If Δ3 ≤ 0, then TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, TW).(A) Let(38)F1(T)=−A+D(cθ+h)θ2(θTeθT−eθT+1)+cIkDθ2(θTeθ(T−M)−eθ(T−M)−θM+1)+pIeDM22.Then,(39)TRC′1(T)=F1(T)T2.Eq. (38) yields(40)F1′(T)=DT[(cθ+h)eθT+cIkeθ(T−M)]>0ifT>0.Hence, F1(T) is increasing on T ≥ 0. Eqs. (33) and (38) imply(41)F1(M)=Δ1,and(42)limT→∞F1(T)=∞.(i) If Δ1 > 0, then(43)F1(T)>F1(M)>0ifT>M.Eq. (43) reveals TRC'1(T) > 0 if T > M. So, TRC1(T) is increasing on [M, ∞).(ii) If Δ1 ≤ 0, the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg, Purcell, & Rigdon, 2007) implies that there exists a unique pointT¯1∈[M,∞)such thatF1(T¯1)=0. So, we have(44)F1(T){<0if0<T<T¯1,(a)=0ifT=T¯1,(b)>0ifT>T¯1.(c)Eq.

So, TRC2(T) is increasing on [TW, ∞).(ii) If Δ2 ≤ 0 < Δ1, the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg et al., 2007) implies that there exists a unique pointT¯2∈[TW,M)such thatF2(T¯2)=0. So, following the similar arguments as in A(ii), we can demonstrate that TRC2(T) is decreasing on(0,T¯2]and increasing on[T¯2,∞). So,T2=T¯2. Also, TRC2(T) is decreasing on [TW, T2] and increasing on [T2, M].(iii) If Δ1 ≤ 0, then0≥Δ1=F2(M)>F2(T)if0<T<M.Eq. (47) reveals TRC'2(T) < 0 if 0 < T < M.

So, following the similar arguments as in A(ii), we can demonstrate that TRC3(T) is decreasing on(0,T¯3]and increasing on[T¯3,∞). So,T3=T¯3. Also, TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, T3] and increasing on [T3, TW).(ii) If Δ3 ≤ 0, then(58)0≥F3(TW)>F3(T)if0<T<TW.Eq. (54) reveals TRC'3(T) < 0 if 0 < T < TW.

We also have that TRC1(T) is decreasing on [TW, T1] and increasing on [T1, ∞).(i)If Δ6 ≤ 0, then TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, TW).If Δ5 ≤ 0 < Δ6, then T4 ∈ [M, TW). We also have that TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T4] and increasing on [T4, TW).If Δ5 > 0, then TRC4(T) is increasing on [M, ∞).(i)If Δ5 > 0, then T3 ∈ (0, M).

Eqs. (66), (68), and (71) imply(74)F4(M)=Δ5,(75)F4(TW)=Δ6,and(76)limT→∞F4(T)=∞.(i) If Δ6 ≤ 0, then(77)0≥F4(TW)>F4(T)ifM≤T<TW.Eq. (72) reveals TRC'4(T) < 0 if M < T < TW. So, TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, TW).(ii) If Δ5 ≤ 0 < Δ6, the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg et al., 2007) implies that there exists a unique pointT¯4∈[M,TW)such thatF4(T¯4)=0. So, following the similar arguments as in Lemma 2[A(ii)], we can demonstrate thatT4=T¯4, and TRC4(T) is decreasing on (0, T4] and increasing on [T4, ∞).(iii) If Δ5 > 0, then(78)F4(T)>F4(M)>0ifT>M.Eq. (72) reveals TRC'4(T) > 0 if T > M. So, TRC4(T) is increasing on [M, ∞).(C) The proof is the same as that of Lemma 2(C).Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Lemma 3.TW> T0 > M.Eq.

(66), (84)–(86), and Lemma 1(A, B) reveal that(87)Δ8>Δ7,and(88)Δ9>Δ5.Lemma 4(A)(i)If Δ4 > 0, then TRC1(T) is increasing on [TW, ∞).If Δ4 ≤ 0, then T1 ∈ [TW, ∞). We also have that TRC1(T) is decreasing on [TW, T1] and increasing on [T1, ∞).(i)If Δ7 ≥ 0, then TRC5(T) is increasing on (T0, ∞).If Δ7 < 0 < Δ8, then T5 ∈ (T0, TW). We also have that TRC5(T) is decreasing on (T0, T5] and increasing on [T5, TW).If Δ8 ≤ 0, then TRC5(T) is decreasing on (T0, TW).(i)If Δ5 > 0, then TRC4(T) is increasing on [M, ∞).If Δ5 ≤ 0 < Δ9, then T4 ∈ [M, T0). We also have that TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T4] and increasing on [T4, T0].If Δ9 ≤ 0, then TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T0].(i)If Δ5 > 0, then T3 ∈ (0, M). We also have that TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, T3] and increasing on [T3, M].If Δ5 ≤ 0, then TRC3(T) is decreasing on [0, M].(A) The proofs of (A)[(i)(ii)] are the same as those of Lemma 3[A(i)(ii)].(B) Let(89)F5(T)=−A+[Dcθ(1−IkαM)+Dh]θ2(θTeθT−eθT+1)+(c2/p)IkD2θ2(eθT−1)(2θTeθT−eθT+1).Then(90)TRC′5(T)=F5(T)T2.Since1−IkαM>0in general, Eq. (89) and Lemma 1(K) yield that if T > 0, then(91)F5′(T)=[Dcθ(1−IkαM)+Dh]θ2(θ2TeθT)+(c2/p)IkD2θ2(θeθT)×(6θTe2θT−e2θT−8θTeθT+2eθT−1+2θT)>0.According to Eq. (91), F5(T) is increasing on T ≥ 0. Eqs. (84) and (85) imply(92)F5(TW)=Δ8,(93)F5(T0)=Δ7,and(94)limT→∞F5(T)=∞.(i) If Δ7 ≥ 0, then(95)F5(T)>F5(T0)=Δ7≥0ifT>T0.Eq. (90) reveals TRC'5(T) > 0 if T > T0. So, TRC5(T) is increasing on [T0, ∞).(ii) If Δ7 < 0 < Δ8, the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg et al., 2007) implies that there exists a unique pointT¯5∈(T0,TW)such thatF5(T¯5)=0. So, following the similar arguments as in Lemma 2[A(ii)], we can demonstrate thatT5=T¯5, and TRC5(T) is decreasing on (0, T5] and increasing on [T5, ∞).(iii) If Δ8 ≤ 0, then(96)0≥Δ8=F5(TW)>F5(T)if0<T<TW.Eq. (90) reveals TRC'5(T) < 0 if 0 < T < TW. Of course, TRC5(T) is decreasing on (T0, TW).(C) (i) The proof is the same as that of Lemma 3[B(iii)].(ii) Eqs. (66), (71), and (86) imply(97)F4(M)=Δ5,(98)F4(T0)=Δ9,and(99)limT→∞F4(T)=∞.If Δ5 ≤ 0 < Δ9, the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg et al., 2007) implies that there exists a unique pointT˜4∈[M,T0)such thatF4(T˜4)=0. So, following the similar arguments as in Lemma 2[A(ii)], we can demonstrate that that TRC4(T) is decreasing on(0,T˜4]and increasing on[T˜4,∞). So,T4=T˜4. Of course, TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T4] and increasing on [T4, T0].(iii) If Δ9 ≤ 0, then(100)0≥Δ9=F4(T0)>F4(T)if0<T<T0.Eq. (72) reveals TRC'4(T) < 0 if 0 < T < T0. Of course, TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, T0].(D) The proof is the same as that of Lemma 2(C).Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Lemma 4.With Eqs. (23), (25), (27), (60), (80), and Lemma 1, we can obtain the following results.(A)If2A−pIeDM2≥0, then TRC1(T) is convex on T ≥ M.TRC2(T) is convex on T > 0.TRC3(T) is convex on T > 0.If2A−pIeDM2≥0, then TRC4(T) is convex on T ≥ M.TRC5(T) is convex on T > 0.Based on the above lemmas, in this section, theorems are proposed to find the optimal replenishment cycle time in each case respectively. For the sake of convenience, each theorem is described by table.Theorem 1For T0 > M ≥ TW, the optimal replenishment cycle time T* that minimizes TRC(T) is given asTable 1.(A):	If Δ1 ≤ 0, Δ2 < 0, and Δ3 ≤ 0, with Lemma 2[A(ii), B(iii), C(ii)], we have(a1) TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, TW).(a2) TRC2(T) is decreasing on [TW, M].(a3) TRC1(T) is decreasing on [M, T1] and increasing on [T1, ∞).Then, (a1)–(a3), Eqs. (10)–(12), and (6)(a–c) implyTRC(T*)=TRC1(T1).(B)–(E): Following the similar arguments as in Theorem 1(A), we can demonstrate that the cases (B)–(E) hold. Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Theorem 1.For T0 ≥ TW> M, the optimal replenishment cycle time T* that minimizes TRC(T) is given asTable 2.(A): If Δ6 ≤ 0, then Δ4 ≤ 0, Δ5 ≤ 0, and Δ6 ≤ 0. With Lemma 3[A(ii), B(i), C(ii)], we have(a1) TRC3(T) is decreasing on [0, M].(a2) TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, TW).(a3) TRC1(T) is decreasing on [TW, T1] and increasing on [T1, ∞).Then, (a1)–(a3), Eqs. (15)–(17), and (13)(a–c) implyTRC(T*)=T1.(B)–(E): Following the similar arguments as in Theorem 2(A), we can demonstrate that the cases (B)–(E) hold. Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Theorem 2.Note that when Δ6 ≤ 0, Theorem 2 in Ouyang et al. (2009) suggests thatT*=T1or M. However, Theorem 2(A) in this paper concludes thatT*=T1. In addition, for the case that Δ4 ≤ 0, Δ5 ≤ 0, and Δ6 > 0, Theorem 2 in Ouyang et al. (2009) suggests thatT*=T1or T4. However, Theorem 2(B) in this paper directly concludes thatT*=T1. As a result, Theorem 2(A, B) in this paper simplify the corresponding results of Theorem 2 in Ouyang et al. (2009).In order to find the optimal replenishment cycle time T* that minimizes TRC(T) in the Case 3, we defineG1=TRC5(T0)−TRC4(T0)andH1=TRC1(TW)−TRC5(TW), and consider four additional situations:(103)(S1)G1>0andH1>0(104)(S2)G1>0andH1≤0(105)(S3)G1≤0andH1>0(106)(S4)G1≤0andH1≤0Furthermore, according to Lemma 4, Eqs. (87) and (88), we can find the optimal replenishment cycle time T* for each possible situations in the table.Theorem 3For TW> T0 > M, the optimal replenishment cycle time T* that minimizes TRC(T) is given asTable 3.[A(a1)]: If Δ4 > 0, Δ5 > 0, Δ7 ≥ 0, Δ8 > 0, and Δ9 > 0. With Lemma 4[A(i), B(i), C(i), D(i)], we have(a11) TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, T3] and increasing on [T3, M].(a12) TRC4(T) is increasing on [M, T0].(a13) TRC5(T) is increasing on (T0, TW).(a14) TRC1(T) is increasing on [TW, ∞).By (18)(a–d), (a11–a14), (16), and (103), it can be found that the annual total relevant cost function TRC(T) is decreasing on (0, T3] and increasing on [T3, ∞). Consequently, we could conclude thatTRC(T*)=TRC3(T3).With the similar argument used in [A(a1)], we can demonstrate that [A(a2)]–[R(r4)] hold. Incorporating the above arguments, we have completed the proof of Theorem 3.Based on the lemmas and theorems proposed in this paper, we could discuss the shortcomings of the theoretical results and solution procedures of Ouyang et al. (2009) in this section.(1)Theorem B [Second Derivative Test (Varberg et al., 2007, p. 164)] can be stated as follows:Let f' and f'' exist at every point in an open interval (a, b) containing c, and suppose thatf′(c)=0.(i)If f''(c) < 0, then f(c) is a local maximum value of f.If f''(c) > 0, then f(c) is a local minimum value of f.Consequently, the Eqs. (A4) and (B4) in Ouyang et al. (2009) can only ensure that T1 and T3 are local minimum points of both TRC1(T) and TRC3(T), respectively. Many examples (Varberg et al., 2007) show that Theorem B cannot draw a conclusion about the maxima or minima without more information in general. Although the conclusions of Lemmas 1–8 and Theorems 1–3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) are correct, the processes of the proofs have some mathematical shortcomings. This paper explores the functional behaviors such as the continuity, decrease, increase, and convexity of the annual total relevant costs function to propose the correct ways of discussions about the minimum points T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 of TRCi(T) (i=1,2,…,5).Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (36) and (37) hold. Lemma 1(A, B) in this paper overcomes these shortcomings.Eqs. (59) and (65) in this paper reveal that Eq. (26) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong. The correct formulation of Δ6 should be Eq. (68) in this paper. Furthermore, Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (69) and (70) hold. Lemma 1(A, B, H) in this paper overcome these shortcomings.Eqs. (59) and (83) in this paper reveal that Eq. (30) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong. The correct formulation of Δ9 should be Eq. (84) in this paper. Furthermore, Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate why Eqs. (87) and (88) hold. However, Lemma 1(A, B) and Eqs. (84)–(86) imply that Eqs. (87) and (88) hold.Since Eq. (30) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is wrong, it should not be true in general that Δ9 ≥ Δ7 and Δ7 ≥ Δ5. Therefore, the validity of Theorem 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) is questionable. Theorem 3 in this paper proposes the correct conclusions about Case 3.Ouyang et al. (2009) do not explore the convexity of TRCi(T). Lemma 5 in this paper provides the proof of the convexity of TRCi(T)(i=1,2,…,5).From the discussion about Case 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009), we haveTRC(T0)=TRC4(T0). However, if TRC5(T0) ≠ TRC4(T0), then TRC(T0) ≠ TRC5(T0). Hence, if TRC5(T0) ≠ TRC4(T0), Eq. (15) in Ouyang et al. (2009) is invalid. The correct formulations of TRC(T) for Case 3 should be Eqs. (18)(a–d) in this paper.In this section, we will discuss two numerical examples to illustrate the results. Both of these two examples indicate that the solution procedure proposed in this paper is simpler and more accurate than that of Ouyang et al. (2009).Example 1Given A = $150/order, D = 1000 units/year, M = 0.12 years, h = $5/unit/year, Ik= $0.1/$/year, Ie= $0.07/$/year, p = $50/unit, c = $20/unit, W = 150 units, θ = 0.05, and α = 0.5. Then, we have TW=0.149440296, T0 = 0.591176044, T0 > TW> M, andΔ6=−48.81286509<0. Following Step 3(1) of the algorithm described in Ouyang et al. (2009),TRC(T*)=min{TRC1(T1),TRC3(M)}.However, if we follow Theorem 2(A) in this paper, we haveTRC(T*)=TRC1(T1).Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem on F1(T), we can easily obtainT*=T1= 0.18609161, andTRC1(T1)=1254.146557. It is in evidence thatTRC3(M)=1488.595181. Consequently, Theorem 2(A) in this paper simplifies Step 3(1) of the algorithm proposed in Ouyang et al. (2009).Given A = $50/order, D = 1000 units/year, M = 0.12 years, h = $5/unit/year, Ik= $0.1/$/year, Ie= $0.07/$/year, p = $50/unit, c = $30/unit, W = 250 units, θ = 0.05, and α = 0.1. Then, we have T0 = 0.220996723, TW= 0.2484504, TW> T0 > M, TRC4(T0) = 1029.265035, TRC5(T0) = 1112.049231, TRC1(TW) = 1010.464592, TRC5(TW) = 1197.715922, Δ4 = 248.729873, Δ5 = 25.4570077, Δ7 = 154.7950047, Δ8 = 209.1780964, and Δ9 = 198.1043919,G1=TRC5(T0)−TRC4(T0)=82.784196>0H1=TRC1(TW)−TRC5(TW)=−187.25133<0.Following Step 4.2(6) of the algorithm proposed in Ouyang et al. (2009),(107)TRC(T*)=min{TRC1(TW),TRC3(T3),TRC5(T0)}.However, Eq. 18(b) reveals thatTRC(T0)=TRC4(T0)≠ TRC5(T0). So, Eq. (107) must be modified asTRC(T*)=min{TRC1(TW),TRC3(T3),TRC4(T0)}.In addition, by Theorem 3[A(a2)] in this paper, we getTRC(T*)=min{TRC1(TW),TRC3(T3)}.Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem (Varberg et al., 2007) on F3(T), we can obtain T3 = 0.097774218 andTRC3(T3)=829.3667074<TRC1(TW)<TRC4(T0)<TRC5(T0). So,T*=T3, andTRC(T*)=829.3667074. Consequently, Theorem 3[A(a2)] in this paper is simpler and more accurate than Step 4.2(6) of the algorithm proposed in Ouyang et al. (2009).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
For the economic order quantity (EOQ) model for deteriorating items with a partially permissible delay in payments linked to order quantity, Ouyang et al. (2009) suggest two solution approaches to solve the problem. One solves ten subcases described in Ouyang et al. (2009) by standard nonlinear programming software. The other solves the complex problem by the algorithm developed with the characteristics of Theorems 1–3 in Ouyang et al. (2009). However, there are some defects in each solution approach.(I)The approach of standard nonlinear programming software: Referring to Eqs. (6)(c), (13)(b), and (18)(b) in this paper, we find that the valid domains of TRC3(T) for Case 1, TRC4(T) for Case 2, and TRC5(T) for Case 3 should be (0, TW), [M, TW), and (T0, TW), respectively. So, problems S-3 (Case 1), S-5 (Case 2), and S-8 (Case 3) in Ouyang et al. (2009) will be modified as follows:S¯−3(Case1):minimizeTRC3(T)subjectto0<T<TW.S¯−5(Case2):minimizeTRC4(T)subjecttoM≤T<TW.S¯−8(Case3):minimizeTRC5(T)subjecttoT0<T<TW.In addition, there are some problems of existence of the minimum point of each sub-problem.About sub-problemS¯−3: Lemma 2[C(ii)] implies that if Δ3 ≤ 0, then TRC3(T) is decreasing on (0, TW). So, TRC3(T) will have no the minimum point on (0, TW). Therefore, if Δ3 ≤ 0, then the minimum point of sub-problemS¯−3does not exist.About sub-problemS¯−5: Lemma 3[B(i)] implies that if Δ6 ≤ 0, then TRC4(T) is decreasing on [M, TW). So, TRC4(T) will have no the minimum point on [M, TW). Therefore, if Δ6 ≤ 0, then the minimum point of sub-problemS¯−5does not exist.About sub-problemS¯−8: Lemma 4[B(iii)] implies that if Δ8 ≤ 0, then TRC5(T) is decreasing on (T0, TW). So, TRC5(T) will have no the minimum point on (T0, TW). Therefore, if Δ8 ≤ 0, then the minimum point of sub-problemS¯−8does not exist.Incorporating the above arguments, we conclude that the approach of nonlinear programming software may not be valid to search for the minimum points for some cases.The algorithm approach:About Step 3(1) in Ouyang et al. (2009): Following Theorem 2(A) in this paper, Step 3(1) in Ouyang et al. (2009) should be simplified as follows:3(1)′ifΔ6≤0,thenTRC(T*)=TRC1(T1)andT*=T1.GotoStep5.About Step 3(2) in Ouyang et al. (2009): Following Theorem 2(B) in this paper, Step 3(2) in Ouyang et al. (2009) should be simplified as follows:3(2)′ifΔ4≤0,Δ5≤0,andΔ6>0,thenTRC(T*)=TRC1(T1)andT*=T1.GotoStep5.About Step 4 in Ouyang et al. (2009): Ouyang et al. (2009) ignore the discontinuity of TRC(T) for Case 3. However, Example 2 in this paper reveals that TRC(T) is not continuous atT=T0and TW, in general. Furthermore, Ouyang et al. (2009) do not demonstrate whether both Δ9 ≥ Δ7 and Δ7 ≥ Δ5 hold. It will be such that Theorem 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) may not be complete. For TW> T0 > M, if Δ4 ≤ 0, Δ5 > 0, Δ7 < 0 < Δ8, and Δ9 > 0, Theorem 3 in Ouyang et al. (2009) cannot provide the optimal solution of TRC(T)since Ouyang et al. (2009) always treat Δ7 ≥ Δ5. However, Theorem 3[K] in this paper impliesTRC(T*)=min{TRC1(T1),TRC3(T3),TRC5(T5)}.Consequently, Step 4 of the algorithm proposed in Ouyang et al. (2009) may not be valid in some cases.Ouyang et al. (2009) adopt the first-order necessary condition and the second derivative test to conclude the minimum point TiofTRCi(T)(i=1,…,5). However, many examples reveal that the second derivative test cannot draw a conclusion about maxima or minima without more information in general. This paper adopts rigorous mathematical methods to explore the functional behaviors ofTRCi(T)(i=1,…,5). A complete solution procedure is also proposed to avoid making wrong decisions and causing cost penalties. In numerical examples, it is proved that the new solution procedure could improve that of Ouyang et al. (2009).
