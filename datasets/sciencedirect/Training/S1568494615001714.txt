@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a novel fuzzy soft set approach in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. First, the uncertain degrees of various parameters are determined via grey relational analysis, which is applied to calculate the grey mean relational degree. Second, suitable mass functions of different independent alternatives with different parameters are given according to the uncertain degree. Third, to aggregate the alternatives into a collective alternative, Dempster's rule of evidence combination is applied. Finally, the alternatives are ranked and the best alternatives are obtained. The effectiveness and feasibility of this approach are demonstrated by comparing with the mean potentiality approach because the measure of performance of this approach is the same as the mean potentiality approach's, the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from 0.4723 to 0.0782 (resp. 0.3821 to 0.0069) in the example of Section 5 (resp. Section 6).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To solve complicated problems in economics, engineering, environmental science and social science, classical mathematical methods are not always successful because of various types of uncertainties present in these problems. There are several theories: probability theory, fuzzy set theory [30], rough set theory [22] and interval mathematics which we can consider as mathematical tools for dealing with uncertainties. But all these theories have their own difficulties. To overcome these kinds of difficulties, Molodtsov [19] proposed soft set theory for modeling uncertainty.Recently works on soft set theory are progressing rapidly. Maji et al. [20] defined fuzzy soft sets by combining soft sets with fuzzy sets, in other words, a degree is attached with the parameterization of fuzzy sets while defining a fuzzy soft set. The study of hybrid models combining soft sets or fuzzy soft sets with other mathematical structures and new operations are emerging as an active research topic of soft set theory [10,29]. Aktas et al. [1] initiated soft groups. Jun applied soft sets to BCK/BCI-algebras [9]. Jiang et al. [10] extended soft sets with description logics. Li et al. [18] investigated relationships among soft sets, soft rough sets and topologies.At the same time, there have been some progress concerning applications of soft set theory, especially the usage of soft sets in decision making. Using soft set theory to describe or set objects with traditional mathematics tools is very different. We can describe approximately the original objects in soft set theory. There is no limiting condition when objects are described. Researchers can choose parameters and their forms according needs. The fact that setting parameters is non-binding greatly simplifies decision-making process and then we can still do effective decisions under the circumstance of the absence of partial information.Maji et al. [21] first applied soft sets to solve decision making problems by means of rough set theory. Chen et al. [3] defined the parameterization reduction of soft set and discussed its application of decision making problem. Cagˇman et al. [4] constructed an uni-int decision making method which selects a set of optimum elements from the alternatives by using uni-int decision functions. Roy et al. [23] discussed score value as the evaluation basis to finding an optimal choice object in fuzzy soft sets. Kong et al. [13] argued that the Roy's method was incorrect in general and they proposed a revised algorithm. Feng et al. [7] applied level soft sets to discuss fuzzy soft sets based decision making. Jiang et al. [11] generalized the adjustable approach to fuzzy soft sets based decision making and presented an adjustable approach to intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets based decision making by using level soft sets of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. Based on Feng’ works, Basu et al. [2] further investigated the previous methods to fuzzy soft sets in decision making and introduced the mean potentiality approach, which was showed more efficient and more accurate than the previous methods.The existing approaches have significant contributions to solve fuzzy soft sets in decision making. However, these approaches are mainly based on the level soft set, and the decision makers select any level soft set with much subjectivity and uncertainty [2]. Moreover, there exists no unique or uniform criterion for the selection, the same decision problem may induce many different results by using different evaluation criteria. As a result, it is difficult to judge that which result is adequate, and which method or level soft sets should be chosen for selecting the optimal choice object. The key to this problem is how to reduce subjectivity and uncertainty when we choose making decisions method. Then it is necessary to pay attention to this issue.Grey relational analysis initiated by Deng [6] is utilized for generalizing estimates under small samples and uncertain conditions, and it can be regarded an effective method to solve decision making problems [12,26,33]. Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a new important reasoning method under uncertainty, which has an advantage to deal with subjective judgments and to synthesize the uncertainty of knowledge [32].Compared to probability theory, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence [5,24] can capture more information to support decision-making by identifying the uncertain and unknown evidence. It provides a mechanism to derive solutions from various vague evidences without knowing much prior information and has been successfully applied into many fields such as intelligent medical diagnosis [8], knowledge reduction [27], fault diagnosis [28], multi-class classification [17], supplier selection [25], etc. Moreover, applying both theories enables the ultimate decision makers to take advantage of both methods’ merits and make evaluation experts to deal with uncertainty and risk confidently [16,25]. The hybrid model has been proved to have its usefulness and versatility in successfully solving a variety of problems in the information sciences, such as data mining, knowledge discovery, and decision making.Therefore, it is very meaningful to explore an approach to fuzzy soft set in decision making by combining Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence with grey relational analysis.The purpose of this paper is to give a novel fuzzy soft set approach in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. The novelty aspects or advantages of this approach is avoiding the selection of appropriate level soft sets and distribution of parameters’ weight, reducing significantly the uncertainty of decision-making and the fuzziness of people's subjective understanding, improving the reliability of decision making and increasing the level of decision-making.Throughout this paper, U denotes an initial universe, E denotes the set of all possible parameters, IUdenotes the family of all fuzzy sets in U. We only consider the case where U and E are both nonempty finite sets.In this section, we briefly recall some basic concepts about fuzzy soft sets, the measure of performance of methods and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence.Definition 2.1[20]Let A⊆E. A pair (F, A) is called a fuzzy soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F:A→IU.In other words, a fuzzy soft set (F, A) over U is a parametrized family of fuzzy sets in the universe U.Example 2.2Let U={h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6} and A={e1, e2, e3, e4}. Let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set over U, defined as follows:F(e1)=h10.6,h21,h30.2,h40.3,h51,h60.7,F(e2)=h11,h20.5,h30.3,h40.2,h50.1,h60.9,F(e3)=h10.1,h20.4,h30.8,h41,h50,h60.1,F(e4)=h10.1,h20.3,h31,h40.9,h50,h61.Then (F, A) is described by Table 1.It is easy to see that every soft set may be considered as a fuzzy soft set (see [7]).Definition 2.3[20]Let A, B⊆E. Let ((F, A) and (G, B) be two fuzzy soft sets over U. Then “(F, A) AND (G, B)” is a fuzzy soft set denoted by (F, A)∧(G, B) and is defined by (F, A)∧(G, B)=(H, A×B), where H(α, β)=F(α) ∩ G(β) for α∈A and β∈B.Definition 2.4[2]The measure of performance of the method (M) which satisfies the optimality criteria to solve a fuzzy soft set in decision making is defined as followsϒM=1∑i=1m∑j=1,i≠jm|F(ei)(Op)−F(ej)(Op)|+∑i=1mF(ei)(Op),where m is the number of choice parameters and F(ei)(Op) is the membership value of the optimal object Opfor the choice parameter ei.Suppose there are two methods M1, M2 which satisfy the optimality criteria and their measure of performances are respectivelyϒM1andϒM2. IfϒM1>ϒM2, then M1 is better than M2. IfϒM1<ϒM2, then M2 is better than M1. IfϒM1=ϒM2, then the performance of the both methods are the same.Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a new important reasoning method under uncertainty. It has an advantage to deal with subjective judgments and to synthesize the uncertainty knowledge (see [32]). This theory discusses a frame of discernment, denoted by Θ, which is a finite nonempty set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses (or all possible outcomes of an event), denoted by {A1, A2, …, An}. 2Θ denotes the set of all subsets of Θ.The independence of evidences does not hold in many cases and people emphasize the independence of evidences in applications of Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. Thus researchers ideally assume the independence of evidences in using Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence.In this paper, we only consider that the sources of evidences are mutually exclusive (i.e., Ai∩Aj=∅ (i≠j)).Definition 2.5[24]Let Θ be a frame of discernment. A basic probability assignment function (for short mass function) on Θ is defined a mapping m:2Θ→[0, 1], m satisfiesm(∅)=0,∑A⊆Θm(A)=1.Definition 2.6[24]Let Θ be the frame of discernment and m:2Θ→[0, 1] be a mass function. Then a belief function Bel:2Θ→[0, 1] on Θ is defined as follows:Bel(∅)=0,Bel(A)=∑B⊆Am(B).In reality, a decision maker can often gain access to more than one information source in order to make decisions. The evidence theory constructs a set of hypotheses of known mass function values from these information sources and then computes a new set of combined evidences. This construction rule is called Dempster's rule of evidence combination for group aggregation.Definition 2.7[24]Let Θ be the frame of discernment. Suppose there are two mass functions are m1 and m2 over Θ, induced by two independent items of evidences A1, A2, …, Asand B1, B2, …, Bt, respectively. Dempster's rule of evidence combination is as follows:m(A)=m1⊕m2(A)=11−K∑Ai∩Bj=Am1(Ai)m2(Bj),∀A⊆Θ,A≠∅,0,A=∅,whereK=∑Ai∩Bj=∅m1(Ai)m2(Bj)<1.The synthesis of multiple evidences can be promoted according to Dempster's rule of evidence combination:m1⊕m2⋯⊕mn(A)=11−K∑⋂i=1nAi=A,Ai⊆Θm1(A1)m2(A2)…mn(An),where A⊆Θ, A≠∅, andK=∑⋂i=1nAi=∅,Ai⊆Θm1(A1)m2(A2)…mn(An)<1.Dempster's rule of evidence combination can increase belief measure and reduce the uncertain degree of the whole evidences to improve reliability.Example 2.8Let Θ={A1, A2} be the frame of discernment. Suppose there are two mass functions m1 and m2 over Θ, induced by a independent piece of evidences A1, A2, given bym1(A1)=0.2,m1(A2)=0.5,m1(Θ)=0.3,m2(A1)=0.4,m2(A2)=0.3,m2(Θ)=0.3.We apply Dempster's rule of evidence combination to combine the two evidences and then have:m(A1)=m1⊕m2(A1)=m1(A1)m2(A1)+m1(A1)m2(Θ)+m1(Θ)m2(A1)1−K=0.3514,m(A2)=m1⊕m2(A2)=m1(A2)m2(A2)+m1(A2)m2(Θ)+m1(Θ)m2(A2)1−K=0.5270,m(Θ)=m1⊕m2(Θ)=m1(Θ)m2(Θ)1−K=0.1216,where K=m1(A1)m2(A2)+m1(A2)m2(A1)=0.26.Like most of decision making problems, fuzzy soft sets based on decision making involve the evaluation of all decision alternatives. Recently, applications of fuzzy soft set based on decision making have attracted more and more attentions. The works of Roy et al. [7,13,23] are fundamental and significant. Later Kong et al. [14] applied grey relational analysis to solve fuzzy soft sets in decision making. Generally, there does not exist any unique or uniform criterion for the evaluation of decision alternatives under uncertain conditions. Thus, Basu et al. [2] further studied and proposed a mean potentiality approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making, which is more deterministic and accurate than Feng's approach [7].Below we introduce the mean potentiality approach.Let U={x1, x2, …, xm} be a universe set and A={e1, e2, …, en} be a parameter set. Given a fuzzy soft set (F, A), F(ej)(xi) denotes the membership value that object xiholds the parameter ejand ρ denotes the maximum number of significant figures among all the membership values of the objects concerned with (F, A). Next, we mainly recall the mean potentiality approach to (F, A) based on decision making problem with equally weighted choice parameters:Step 1.Find a normal parameter reduction B of A. If it exists, we construct the tabular representation of (F, B). Otherwise, we construct the tabular representation of (F, A) with the choice values of each object.Compute the mean potentialitymp=∑i=1m∑j=1nF(ej)(xi)/m×nup to ρ significant figures, denoted bymp′.Construct amp′-level soft set of (F, A) and represent it in a tabular form, then compute the choice value cifor each xi.Denote max {c1, c2, …, cm}=ck. If ckis unique, then the optimal choice object is xkand the process will be stopped. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Compute the non-negative difference between the largest and the smallest membership value in each column (resp. each row) and denote it as aj(j=1, 2, …, n) (resp. βi(i=1, 2, …, m)).Compute the averageα=∑j=1naj/nup to ρ significant figures, denoted by α′.Construct a α′-level soft set of (F, A) and represent it in tabular form, then compute the choice valuec′ifor each xi.Denote max{c′1,c′2,…,c′m}=c′l. Ifc′lis unique, then the optimal choice object is xland the process will be stopped. Otherwise, go to Step 9.Consider the object corresponding to the minimum value of βi(i=1, 2, …, m) as the optimal choice of decision makers.We give the following example to illustrate mean potentiality approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making.Example 3.1Let (F, A) be the fuzzy soft set given in Table 2.(1)Since A is indispensable, there does not exist any normal parameter reduction of A.The mean potentiality of (F, A) ismp=∑i=13∑j=15F(ej)(xi)/3×5=0.626, thusmp′=0.63.mp′-level soft set of (F, A) with choice values is given by Table 3.Since x1 and x2 have the same maximum choice values (3), we have to calculate the αjand βivalues of (F, A).See Table 4Now α=0.29+0.31+0.44+0.32+0.32/5=0.336, thus α′=0.34.So the α′-level soft set of (F, A) with choice valuesc′i(i=1,2,3)is given by Table 5.Here max{c′1,c′2,c′3}={c′2,c′3}, i.e., not unique, we have to consider the β2 and β3.Since min{β2, β3}=β3(=0.37), x3 is the optimal choice object.The existing approaches to fuzzy soft sets in decision making are mainly based on the level soft set to obtain useful information such as choice values and score values. However, it is very difficult for decision makers to select a suitable level soft set. Inspired by the work of Wu et al. [16,25], we introduce a new approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. It not only allows us to avoid the problem of selecting the suitable level soft set, but also helps reducing uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level.Our approach includes three phases: first, grey relational analysis is applied to calculate the grey mean relational degree between each independent alternative and the mean of all alternatives with each parameter, and the uncertain degree of each parameter is obtained. Second, the suitable mass function with respect to each parameter (or evidence) is constructed by the uncertain degree of each parameter. Third, we apply Dempster's rule of evidence combination to aggregate independent evidences into a collective evidence, by which the candidate's alternatives are ranked and the best alternative(s) are obtained.In the following, we consider a decision making problem concerned with m mutually exclusive alternatives xiand n evaluation parameters (or evidences) ej. xijdenotes the value that the choice decision xiis supported by the evidence ej. PutΘ={x1,x2,…,xm}andA={e1,e2,…,en}.Define F:A→IΘ by F(ej)(xi)=xij. Then (F, A) is a fuzzy soft set over Θ andD=(xij)m×nis called a fuzzy soft decision matrix induced by (F, A).In this paper, we will consider the parameter set of the decision making as a set of evidence.Compared to probability theory, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence captures more information to support decision making, by identifying the uncertain and unknown evidences. It provides a mechanism to derive solutions from various vague evidences (or parameter) without knowing much prior information. We must get mass functions of alternatives with each evidence (or parameter) beforehand if we apply Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence to make decisions. However, how to find uncertain degree of evidences (or parameters) is a critical problem. Grey relational analysis is employed as a means to reflect uncertainty between experts in multiple parameter models through the membership value. Next, we apply grey relational analysis to obtain uncertain degree of evidences (or parameters).We first present some basic notions.Definition 4.1[15]Let Θ={x1, x2, …, xm}, A={e1, e2, …, en} and let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set on Θ. Suppose thatD=(xij)m×nis a fuzzy soft decision matrix induced by (F, A). For each i, j, denotexi˜=1n∑j=1nxij,Δxij=|xij−xi˜|,rij=min1⩽i⩽mΔxij+ρmax1⩽i⩽mΔxijΔxij+ρmax1⩽i⩽mΔxij,whereρ∈(0,1),DOI(ej)=1m∑i=1m(rij)q1q(j=1,2,…,n).Then(1)xi˜is called the mean of all parameters with respect to xi,Δxijis called the difference information between xijandxi˜,ρ is called the distinguishing coefficient and rijis called the grey mean relational degree between xijandxi˜,DOI(ej) is called q order uncertain degree of the parameter ej.Similarly, to obtain strong distinguishing effectiveness, we use the Euclidean distance rather than the Hamming distance, namely q=2.It is worthy to notice that the approach to obtain the uncertain degree in Definition 4.1 varies in different situation. Since a parameter is specially more matching with the mean of the parameter set than other parameters, the parameter contains more satisfying information for decision making and the uncertain degree of the parameter with respect to alternatives is lower. Then, in this paper we just consider grey mean relational degree between xijandxi˜.Definition 4.2[31]Let X=(x1, x2, …, xm) be a finite difference information sequence, where there existsxik≠0for k=1, 2, …, m and 1⩽ik⩽m. Then the information structure image sequence Y=(y1, y2, …, ym) is given byyi=xi/∑i=1mxi.Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a powerful method for combining accumulative evidences of changing prior opinions in the light of new evidences [24]. The primary procedure about combining the known evidences or information with other evidences is to construct suitable mass functions of evidences. It is flexible to obtain mass function and people's experience, knowledge or thinking will affect the selection of mass function.Now, by the uncertain degree of each parameter, we can obtain mass function of each alternative with respect to each parameter.Theorem 4.3Let Θ={x1, x2, …, xm}, A={e1, e2, …, en} and let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set on Θ. Suppose thatD=(xij)m×nis a fuzzy soft decision matrix induced by (F, A), where xijdenotes the membership value that the alternative xiholds the parameter ej. Denotexij˜=xij/∑i=1mxij.We define functionsmej(j=1,2,…,n)with respect to the parameter ej, it satisfies:mej(xi)=xij˜(1−DOI(ej))(i=1,2,…,m,j=1,2,…,n),mej(Θ)=1−∑i=1mmj(i)(j=1,2,…,n).Thenmej(j=1,2,…,n)are mass functions.In a fuzzy soft decision matrixD=(xij)m×n, denotemej(xi),mej(Θ)by mj(i) and mj(m+1), respectively. mj(i) implies the belief measure of the alternative xiwith the parameter ej. mj(m+1) implies the belief measure of the whole uncertainty with respect to the parameter ej.Since a single evidence does not fully reflect the characteristics of the operating rules of things, then multiple evidences are used when we make decisions. How to promote the organic integration of different evidences, this needs Dempster's rule of evidence because using this rule can make the fusion of evidences, the fusion of evidences is to reduce the uncertainty and to manage the conflicting information, and the results of the fusion of evidences characterizes the nature of complex phenomena. Thus, we use Dempster's rule of evidence in this paper.Next, using Dempster's rule of evidence combination to compose m1, m2, …, mnwith respect to each alternative xi, we get the belief measure of each alternative xi. Thus we obtain decision making results.Based on the above analysis, given a fuzzy soft set (F, E) concerned with m mutually exclusive alternatives xiand n evaluation parameters ej, the decision procedure of our approach for (F, E) can be summarized as follows:Step 1.Construct a fuzzy soft decision matrixD=(xij)m×ninduced by (F, A), where xijis the membership value of xiwith ej.Calculate the mean of all parameters with respect to each alternative byxi˜=1n∑j=1nxij(i=1,2,…,m).Calculate the difference information between xijandxi˜and construct the difference matrix byΔxij=|xij−xi˜|,ΔD=(Δxij)m×n(i=1,2,…,m,j=1,2,…,n).Calculate the grey mean relational degree between xijandxi˜byrij=min1⩽i⩽mΔxij+0.5max1⩽i⩽mΔxijΔxij+0.5max1⩽i⩽mΔxij(i=1,2,…,m,j=1,2,…,n).Calculate the uncertain degree of each parameter ejbyDOI(ej)=1m∑i=1m(rij)212(j=1,2,…,n).Calculate the information structure image sequence xjwith respect to each parameter ejand construct the matrix by Definition 4.2.Calculate mass function values of each alternative xiand Θ with respect to each parameter ejby Theorem 4.3.Calculate belief measure of each alternative xiby Definition 2.10.Obtain decision making. The decision is xkif ck=maxBel({xi}).Optimal choices have more than one object if there are more alternatives corresponding to the maximum.In this section, we give the following example to illustrate our approach.Example 5.1Using our approach, we reconsider the fuzzy soft set (F, A) given in Example 3.1.Now, we suppose that the three mutually exclusive and exhaustive alternatives construct a frame of discernment, denoted by Θ={x1, x2, x3}. We consider the set of parameters A={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5} as a set of evidences.(1)Construct a fuzzy soft decision matrix induced by (F, A) as follows:D=(xij)3×5=0.850.710.380.320.750.560.820.760.640.430.840.510.820.530.47Calculate the mean of all parameters with respect to each alternative xias follows:x1˜=0.6020,x2˜=0.6420,x3˜=0.6340,Calculate the difference information between xijandxi˜, and construct the difference matrix as follows:ΔD=0.24800.10800.22200.28200.14800.08200.17800.11800.00200.21200.20600.12400.18600.10400.1640Calculate the grey mean relational degree between xijandxi˜based on ΔD as follows:(rij)3×5=0.55381.00000.68770.33811.00001.00000.73781.00001.00000.79870.62420.92490.77100.58370.9407Calculate the uncertain degree of each parameter ejas follows:DOI(e1)=0.4341,DOI(e2)=0.5164,DOI(e3)=0.4793,DOI(e4)=0.4021,DOI(e5)=0.5295.Calculate the information structure image sequence with respect to each parameter ejand construct the matrix as follows:D˜=(xij˜)3×5=0.37780.34800.19390.21480.45450.24890.40200.38780.42950.26060.37330.25000.41840.35570.2848For each A∈2Θ with |A|=0 or 2, put m(A)=0. We calculate mass function values of each alternative xiand Θ with respect to parameter ejby Theorem 4.3:(1)(mj(i))3×5=0.21380.16830.10100.12840.21390.14080.19440.20190.25680.12260.21130.12090.21790.21270.1340andm1(4)=0.4341,m2(4)=0.5164,m3(4)=0.4793,m4(4)=0.4021,m5(4)=0.5295.The mean of belief measure of the whole uncertainty is(0.4341+0.5164+0.4793+0.4021+0.5295)/5=0.4723Calculate belief measure of each alternative xiby combining these evidences respectively by Definition 2.7:Bel({x1})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m5({x1})=0.2690,Bel({x2})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m5({x2})=0.3309,Bel({x3})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m5({x3})=0.3218,Bel(Θ)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m5(Θ)=0.0782.Then the final rang order is x2≻x3≻x1.According to the maximum belief measure principle, the optimally choice decision is x2, which is different from the choice decision by using the mean potentiality approach in Example 3.1.Now, by Definition 2.7, we can calculate the measure of performance of our approach ϒ=3.7202, and the measure of performance of the mean potentiality approach ϒ=3.6462.In summary, the result of the comparison of the above two approaches can be shown in Table 6.From the above results, the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from the initial mean 0.4723–0.0782 after evidence combination. This implies that our approach combined grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence can help reducing uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level. Moreover, judged by the measures ϒ of performance, our approach is more accurate and effective than the mean potentiality approach under uncertain information.A major task of medical science is to diagnose diseases. Generally a patient suffering from a disease may have multiple symptoms and the information available to physician about his patient is inherently uncertain. Again it is also observed that there are certain symptoms which may be common to more than one diseases leading to diagnostic dilemma. Doctors always detect clinical manifestations by the comparison with predefined classes to find the most similar disease. Only one comprehensive result can be gotten from existing methods for medical diagnosis, which cannot provide the certainty or uncertainty of the result. One of the toughest challenges in medical diagnosis is handling uncertainty. Therefore, it is necessary to find another method to deal with the unknown factors in the process of medical diagnosis and improve level of medical diagnosis, then we apply our approach to solve medical diagnosis problems.Now we consider a medical diagnosis problem with seven symptoms such as fever, running nose, weakness, oro-facial pain, nausea vomiting, swelling, trismus which have more or less contribution in four diseases such as acute dental abscess, migraine, acute sinusitis, peritonsillar abscess. Now, from medical statistics, the degree of availability of these seven symptoms in these four diseases is observed as follows. The degree of belonging of all the symptoms fever, running nose, weakness, oro-facial pain, nausea vomiting, swelling, trismus for the diseases acute dental abscess, migraine, acute sinusitis, peritonsillar abscess respectively are {0.6, 0, 0.6, 0.9, 0, 0.7, 0.8}, {0.2, 0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0, 0}, {0.3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.8, 0.3, 0.4, 0}, {0.4, 0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.6, 0.5}. The degree of belonging of all the detecting tools history, physical examination, laboratory investigation for these diseases are {0.6, 0.8, 0.4}, {0.8, 0.3, 0.6}, {0.8, 0.4, 0.7}, {0.6, 0.8, 0.3}, respectively. Suppose a patient who is suffering a disease, have the symptoms fever, running nose, oro-facial pain and is diagnosed by the three tools. Now the problem is how a doctor detects the actual disease with effective symptoms and diagnosed tools among these four diseases for that patient. To solve this problem first we detect the disease which is most suited with the observed symptoms of patients and then secondly we find the actual symptoms which is optimal for that disease. These can be solved by means of fuzzy soft sets.We use the following notations:(i) {fever, running nose, weakness, oro-facial pain, nausea vomiting, swelling, trismus, history, physical examination, laboratory investigation}={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, s1, s2, s3}=E.

They are describing “symptoms of the diseases” and “decision making tools of the diseases”, respectively. (F, A)∧(G, B) is given in Table 9.The key problem is how a doctor reaches to the most suitable diagnosis according to these symptoms, history, physical examination and laboratory investigation of patients. To solve this problem, we consider “(F, A) AND (G, B)”, given by Table 10. There are four diseases x1, x2, x3, x4, and nine pairs of parameters a1=(e1, s1), a2=(e1, s2), a3=(e1, s3), a4=(e2, s1), a5=(e2, s2), a6=(e2, s3), a7=(e4, s1), a8=(e4, s2), a9=(e4, s3), which is a pair of one symptom and one decision making tool, respectively.Next we will apply our approach to detect which disease is most suited with the symptoms and these investigative procedures. Then, in the making decision, we consider that the four diseases construct a frame of discernment, denoted by Θ={x1, x2, x3, x4}. We consider the nine pairs of parameters as a set of evidences, which contains a diagnosis parameter system, denoted by P={a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}.Step 1.We construct a fuzzy soft decision matrix induced by “(F, A) AND (G, B)”, which completely presents the degree that a patient is suffering from a disease xiwith one symptom and one decision making tool aj.D=(xij)4×9=0.60.60.40000.60.80.40.20.20.20000.80.30.60.30.30.30.70.40.70.80.40.70.40.40.30000.60.70.3Since ajis specially more matching the mean of the parameter set than other parameters, ajcontains the satisfying information for decision making and the uncertain degree of ajis low. Now, we consider the mean possible of the diagnosis parameter system with respect to the four diseases, calculated byxi˜=19∑j=19xijas follows:x1˜=0.3778,x2˜=0.2556,x3˜=0.5111,x4˜=0.3000.To obtain the grey mean relational degree, we need to calculate the difference information between xijandxi˜and construct the difference matrix as follows:ΔD=0.22220.22220.02220.37780.37780.37780.22220.42220.02220.05560.05560.05560.25560.25560.25560.54440.04440.34440.21110.21110.21110.18890.11110.18890.28890.11110.18890.10000.10000.00000.30000.30000.30000.30000.40000.0000Based on the difference matrix ΔD, the gray mean relational degree between xijandxi˜is calculated as follows:(rij)4×9=0.50000.50000.82610.66670.52940.66671.00000.40350.88571.00001.00000.65520.85000.67500.85000.60541.00000.33330.51720.51720.33331.00001.00001.00000.88120.79310.47690.78950.78951.00000.77270.61360.77270.86410.41821.0000In order to obtain mass functions of xiand Θ with respect to aj, now we need to calculate the uncertain degree of ajas follows:DOI(a1)=0.3658,DOI(a2)=0.3658,DOI(a3)=0.3727,DOI(a4)=0.4156,DOI(a5)=0.3634,DOI(a6)=0.4156,DOI(a7)=0.4250,DOI(a8)=0.3506,DOI(a9)=0.3643.We calculate the information structure image sequence with respect to ajand construct the matrix as follows:D˜=(xij˜)4×9=0.40000.40000.33330000.21430.36360.20000.13330.13330.16670000.28570.13640.30000.20000.20000.25001.00001.00001.00000.28570.18180.35000.26670.26670.25000000.21430.31820.1500For each A∈2Θ with |A|=0, 2, 3, put m(A)=0.

By Definition 2.10, we can get the following results:Bel({x1})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9({x1})=0.0827,Bel({x2})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9({x2})=0.0284,Bel({x3})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9({x3})=0.8349,Bel({x4})=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9({x4})=0.0471,Bel(Θ)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(Θ)=0.0069.Then the final range order is x3≻x1≻x4≻x2.According to the maximum belief measure principle, the patient is suffering from acute sinusitis x3, which is the same choice decision based on the mean potentiality approach of Example 6.2 in [2].By Definition 2.7, the measure of performance of our approach is the same ϒ=4.1726 as the mean potentiality approach's.In summary, the results of this comparison study can be shown in Table 10.From above results, the initial mean of the belief measure of the whole uncertainty is1/9∑j=19mj(5)=0.3821, but the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls the originally mean value 0.3821–0.0069 after evidence combination. It implies that our approach combined Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence with grey relational analysis declines the uncertainty to a great extent and improves accuracy and reliability of medical diagnosis effectively. It is worthy noting that the result from our approach also gives the second and the third possible disease, which is clearer than that of Basu's approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have introduced a novel fuzzy soft set approach in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence and given an application for medical diagnosis. Detailed flow chart and schematic block diagram of the proposed approach is as follows:Since the measure of performance of this approach is the same as the mean potentiality approach's, the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from 0.4723 to 0.0782 (resp. 0.3821 to 0.0069) in the example of Section 5 (resp. Section 6), the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach are demonstrated by comparing with the mean potentiality approach. The disadvantages of this approach are also reflected in here because it do not compare with more approaches. This approach can help reducing uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level, allows us to avoid this problem of selecting the suitable level soft set and are more feasible and practical for dealing with applications under uncertainty. Moreover, this approach sets up decision making models and thus broadens application fields of grey system theory. In future work, we will test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system.
