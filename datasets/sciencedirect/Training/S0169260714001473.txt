QRS detection using S-Transform and Shannon energy

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
This work makes a QRS detection based on S-Transform (TS).The TS allows us access to the frequency content of the QRS complexes without recourse to any filtering.Shannon energy is computed for each obtained local spectrum. Shannon energy highlights all QRSs, even those having a small amplitude.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a novel method for QRS detection in electrocardiograms (ECG). It is based on the S-Transform, a new time frequency representation (TFR). The S-Transform provides frequency-dependent resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum. We exploit the advantages of the S-Transform to isolate the QRS complexes in the time–frequency domain. Shannon energy of each obtained local spectrum is then computed in order to localize the R waves in the time domain.Significant performance enhancement is confirmed when the proposed approach is tested with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The obtained results show a sensitivity of 99.84%, a positive predictivity of 99.91% and an error rate of 0.25%. Furthermore, to be more convincing, the authors illustrated the detection parameters in the case of certain ECG segments with complicated patterns.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electrocardiography is an important tool in diagnosing the condition of the heart. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that records the electrical activity of the heart. It is characterized by its main waves: P, QRS and T. QRS complex is the most striking waveform within the ECG. It represents the depolarization phenomenon of the ventricles and yields useful information about their behavior.Since the QRS complex is the dominant feature of the ECG signal, its detection is a crucial part of any ECG analysis algorithm. Once the positions of the QRS complexes are found, the locations of other components like P, T waves and ST segment, etc. are found relative to the position of the QRS, in order to analyze the complete cardiac period. QRS detection can be done rather easily by the trained eye of cardiologist. Unluckily, the problem of automation of this process is difficult, not only because of the physiological variability of the QRS complexes, but also because of the various types of noise that can be present in the ECG signal. Noise sources include muscle noise, artifacts due to electrode motion, power-line interference, baseline wander, P and T waves with high-frequency characteristics similar to QRS complexes.Within the last decades, a wide diversity of QRS detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In [1], Köhler et al. have summarized and compared the most important approaches proposed until 2000. Refs. [2–4] represent original works on this subject. Such algorithms are based on digital filters and ECG signal derivative. This points out the usage of the characteristic steep slop of the QRS for its detection. Other algorithms are based on more sophisticated filters [5–7], filters and Hilbert transform [8]. Some algorithms operate in the time domain. R peak detection based on zero crossing counts is proposed in [9]. In [10], Christov has used adaptive thresholds considering noise level and low amplitude beats. Wavelet transform has also been widely used for QRS detection [11–16] but along with its flexibility, comes the price of determining the appropriate mother wavelet and level decomposition. Other methods were based on more complex approaches, neural network [12,17], Support Vector Machines [18], genetic algorithms [19], Hidden Markov Models [20], K-Nearest Neighbor [21] and combination of different algorithms working in parallel [22,23].Although the performance of these algorithms, high detection accuracy still remains open problems. The currently achievable detection rates hide the problems that are still present in case of very noisy or pathological signals. A satisfying solution to these problems is still not found.QRS detection algorithm in this paper is based on the S-Transform (ST). After ECG time–frequency decomposition, Shannon energy of local spectra is used to localize each QRS complex. The proposed algorithm was validated against the standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB).The paper is organized as follows. After an introductory, Section 2 presents the S-Transform principle and how the QRS complexes are localized in the time domain. Accordingly, an algorithm of R peak detection is developed. The proposed method is tested in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.
