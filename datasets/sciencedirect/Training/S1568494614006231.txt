@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many fields deal with the uncertain data which may not be successfully modeled by the classical mathematics, probability theory, fuzzy sets [30], rough sets [26], and other mathematical tools. In 1999, Molodtsov [25] proposed a completely new approach so-called soft set theory that is more universal for modeling vagueness and uncertainty.After Molodtsov's work, Maji et al. [23] introduced several operations of soft sets in more detail. Ali et al. [4] gave some new notions such as the restricted intersection, the restricted union, the restricted difference and the extended intersection of two soft sets and Sezgin and Atagün [28] were extended the theoretical aspect of operations on soft sets. Then, Çağman and Enginoglu [13] redefined the operations of Molodtsov's soft sets to make them more functional for improving several new results and gave products of soft sets and uni–int decision function. Also Çağman and Enginoglu [11], defined soft matrices and their operations which are more functional to make theoretical studies in the soft set theory in the problems that contain uncertainties. Majumdar and Samanta [24] and Kharal [20] presented some similarity measures for soft set with applications.Application of soft sets in algebraic structures is introduced by Aktaş and Çağman [3]. Later the algebraic structure of soft set theory has been studied increasingly (e.g. [1,6,16]) and also algebraic structure of fuzzy soft set theory has been studied by Aygünoglu and Aygün [8].Some researchers have worked many interesting applications of soft set theory by embedding the ideas of fuzzy sets. Feng et al. [17], Çağman et al. [12] and Yang et al. [29] on theory of fuzzy soft sets, Ali [5] on link between soft sets and fuzzy soft sets, Deng and Wang [27] studied an application of fuzzy soft sets in unknown data in incomplete fuzzy soft sets, Basu et al. [9] has been given to get a balanced solution of a fuzzy soft set based decision making problem. In recent years, many interesting applications of soft set theory have been expanded by embedding the ideas of rough sets (e.g. [5,18]) and intuitionistic fuzzy sets (e.g. [2,19,21,22]).The notion of FP (fuzzy parametrizied)-soft sets is given by Çağman et al. [10]. Later the applications of FP-soft set theory have been studied by [14,15]. In this paper, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft sets for dealing with uncertainties that is based on both soft sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Therefore, an approximate function of the intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft sets are set valued function and decision obtained by using the operations of soft sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets that make this sets very convenient and easily applicable in practice. In this paper is organized as follows. We first define intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft sets (intuitionistic FP-soft sets), and study their operations and properties. We then introduce a decision making method based on intuitionistic FP-soft sets. A numerical example is provided illustrates the effectiveness of the method which is more practical.In this section, we give the basic definitions of soft set theory [25], fuzzy set theory [30], intuitionistic fuzzy set theory [7] and FP-soft set theory [10] that are useful for subsequent discussions.Definition 1[25] Let U be a universe, P(U) be the power set of U and E be a set of parameters. A soft set S over U is a set defined by a set valued function S representing a mappingfS:E→P(U)that is, it can be written a set of ordered pairsS={(x,fS(x)):x∈E}Here, fSis called approximate function of the soft set S and fS(x) is called x-approximate value of x∈E. The subscript S in the fSindicates that fSis the approximate function of S.Generally, fS, fT, fV, …, will be used as an approximate functions of S, T, V, …, respectively.Note that if fS(x)=∅, then the element (x, fS(x)) is not appeared in S.Example 1Assume that U={u1, u2, u3, u4} is the universe contains four houses under consideration in a real estate agent and E={x1, x2, x3, x4} is the set of parameters, where xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4) stand for ‘safety”, “cheap”, “technological” and “large garden”, respectively.A customer to select a house from the real estate agent can construct a soft set S that describes the characteristic of houses according to own requests. Assume that fS(x1)={u1, u2, u5}, fS(x2)={u2, u4}, fS(x3)=∅, fS(x4)=U then the soft-set S is written byS={(x1,{u1,u2,u5}),(x2,{u2,u4}),(x4,U)}Definition 2[30] Let E be a universe. Then a fuzzy set X over E is a function defined as follows:X={(μX(x)/x):x∈E}where μX:E→[0, 1].Here, μXcalled membership function of X, and the value μX(x) is called the grade of membership of x∈E. The value represents the degree of x belonging to the fuzzy set X.Definition 3[7] Let E be a universe. An intuitionistic fuzzy set A on E can be defined as follows:A={〈x,μA(x),γA(x)〉:x∈E}where, μA:E→[0, 1] and γA:E→[0, 1] such that 0≤μA(x)+γA(x)≤1 for any x∈E.Here, μA(x) and γA(x) is the degree of membership and degree of non-membership of the element x, respectively.If A and B are two intuitionistic fuzzy sets on E, theni.A⊂B if and only if μA(x)≤μB(x) and γA(x)≥γB(x) for ∀x∈EA=B if and only if μA(x)=μB(x) and γA(x)=γB(x) ∀x∈EAc={〈x, γA(x), μA(x)〉:x∈E}A∪B={〈x, max(μA(x), μB(x)), min(γA(x), γB(x)〉:x∈E},A∩B={〈x, min(μA(x), μB(x)), max(γA(x), γB(x)〉:x∈E},A+B={〈x, μX(x)+μY(x)−μX(x)μY(x), γX(x)γY(x)〉:x∈E},A·B={〈x, μA(x)μB(x), γA(x)+γB(x)−γA(x)γB(x)〉:x∈E}.Definition 4[10] Let U be an initial universe, P(U) be the power set of U, E be a set of all parameters and X be a fuzzy set over E. Then a FP-soft set (fX, E) on the universe U is defined as follows:(fX,E)={(μX(x)/x,fX(x)):x∈E}where μX:E→[0, 1] and fX:E→P(U) such that fX(x)=∅ if μX(x)=0.Here fXcalled approximate function and μXcalled membership function of FP-soft sets.Assume that U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9} is a universal set and E={a1, a2, a3, a4} is a set of all parameters. If X={0.7/a1, 0.5/a2, 0.6/a3, 0, 9/a4} is a fuzzy set over E, then we can write the following FP-soft set:(fX,E)=(0.7/a1,{u2,u3,u4,u5,u7}),(0.5/a2,{u4,u5,u7}),(0.6/a3,{u1,u2,u3,u4,u9}),(0.9/a4,{u1,u2,u5,u7,u8})In this section, we define intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft sets (intuitionistic FP-soft sets) and their operations.Definition 5Let U be an initial universe, P(U) be the power set of  U, E be a set of all parameters and K be an intuitionistic fuzzy set over E. An intuitionistic FP-soft sets ⨿Kover U is defined as follows:⨿K=(〈x,αK(x),βK(x)〉,fK(x)):x∈Ewhere αK:E→[0, 1], βK:E→[0, 1] and fK:E→P(U) with the property fK(x)=∅ if αK(x)=0 and βK(x)=1.Here, the function αKand βKcalled membership function and non-membership of intuitionistic FP-soft set, respectively. The value αK(x) and βK(x) is the degree of importance and unimportant of the parameter x.Obviously, each ordinary FP-soft set can be written as⨿K=(〈x,αK(x),1−αK(x)〉,fK(x)):x∈ENote that the sets of all intuitionistic FP-soft sets over U will be denoted by IFPS(U).Definition 6Let ⨿K∈IFPS(U). If αK(x)=0 and βK(x)=1 for all x∈E, then ⨿Kis called a empty intuitionistic FP-soft sets, denoted by ⨿Φ.Let ⨿K∈IFPS(U). If αK(x)=1, βK(x)=0 and fK(x)=U for all x∈E, then ⨿Kis called universal intuitionistic FP-soft set, denoted by⨿E˜.Example 3Assume that U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5} is a universal set and E={x1, x2, x3} is a set of parameters. IfK={〈x1,0.2,0.5〉,〈x2,0.5,0.5〉,〈x3,0.6,0.3〉}andfK(x1)={u2,u4},fK(x2)=∅,fK(x3)=Uthen an intuitionistic FP-soft set ⨿Kis written by⨿K={(〈x1,0.2,0.5〉,{u2,u4}),(〈x2,0.5,0.5〉,∅),(〈x3,0.6,0.3〉,U)}If L={〈x1, 0, 1〉, 〈x2, 0, 1〉, 〈x3, 0, 1〉, 〈x4, 0, 1〉}, then the intuitionistic FP-soft set ⨿Lis an empty intuitionistic FP soft set.If M={〈x1, 1, 0〉, 〈x2, 1, 0〉, 〈x3, 1, 0〉, 〈x4, 1, 0〉} and fM(x1)=U, fM(x2)=U,fM(x3)=U and fM(x4)=U, then the intuitionistic FP-soft set ⨿Mis a universal intuitionistic FP-soft set.⨿K, ⨿L∈IFPS(U). Then ⨿Kis a intuitionistic FP-soft subset of ⨿L, denoted by⨿K⊆˜⨿L, if and only if αK(x)≤αL(x), βK(x)≥βL(x)andfK(x)⊆fL(x) for all x∈E.⨿K⊆˜⨿Ldoes not imply that every element of ⨿Kis an element of ⨿Las in the definition of classical subset. For example, assume that U={u1, u2, u3, u4} is a universal set of objects and E={x1, x2, x3} is a set of all parameters. If K={〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉} and L={〈x1, 0.5, 0.5〉, 〈x3, 0.4, 0.5〉}, and ⨿K={(〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉, {u2, u4})}, ⨿L={(〈x1, 0.5, 0.5〉, {u2, u3, u4}), (〈x3, 0.4, 0.5〉, {u1, u5})}, then for all x∈E, αK(x)≤αL(x), βK(x)≥βL(x)and⨿K(x)⊆⨿L(x) is valid. Hence⨿K⊆˜⨿L. It is clear that (〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉, {u2, u4})∈⨿Kbut (〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉, {u2, u4})∉⨿L.Let ⨿K, ⨿L∈IFPS(U).

Then union of ⨿Kand ⨿L, denoted by⨿K∪˜⨿L, is defined by⨿K∪˜⨿L=(〈x,max(αK(x),αL(x)),min(βK(x),βL(x))〉,fK∪˜L(x)):x∈EwherefK∪˜L(x)=fK(x)∪fL(x).Let ⨿K, ⨿L, ⨿M∈IFPS(U).

Then intersection of ⨿Kand ⨿L, denoted by⨿K∩˜⨿L, is a intuitionistic FP-soft sets defined by⨿K∩˜⨿L=〈x,min(αK(x),αL(x)),max(βK(x),βL(x)〉,fK∩˜L(x)):x∈EwherefK∩˜L(x)=fK(x)∩fL(x).Let ⨿K, ⨿L, ⨿M∈IFPS(U).

If ⨿K≠⨿Φ or⨿K≠⨿E˜, then⨿K∪˜⨿Kc≠⨿E˜and⨿K∩˜⨿Kc≠⨿Φ.For example, assume that U={u1, u2, u3, u4} is a universal set of objects and E={x1, x2} is a set of all parameters. If K={〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉, 〈x2, 0.5, 0.5〉}, and⨿K={(〈x1, 0.4, 0.6〉, {u2, u4})}, (〈x2, 0.5, 0.5〉, {u2, u3, u4})}, then Kc={〈x1, 0.6, 0.4〉, 〈x2, 0.5, 0.5〉}, and⨿Kc={(〈x1,0.6,0.4〉,{u1,u3})},(〈x2,0.5,0.5〉,{u1})},Therefore;⨿K∪˜⨿Kc={(〈x1,0.6,0.4〉,{U})},(〈x2,0.5,0.5〉,{U})}≠⨿E˜and⨿K∩˜⨿Kc{(〈x1,0.4,0.6〉,∅)},(〈x2,0.5,0.5〉,{∅})}≠⨿Φ.Let ⨿K, ⨿L, ⨿M∈IFPS(U).

We then have defined a reduced fuzzy set of an intuitionistic fuzzy set, that produce a fuzzy set from an intuitionistic fuzzy set. These sets present an adjustable approach to intuitionistic FP-soft sets based decision making problems.Definition 17Let ⨿Kbe an intuitionistic FP-soft set. Then, a reduced intuitionistic fuzzy set of ⨿K, denoted by Krif, defined as follows:Krif=〈u,αKrif(u),βKrif(u)〉:u∈UwhereαKrif:U→[0,1],αKrif(u)=1|U|∑x∈E,u∈UαK(x)χfK(x)(u)βKrif:U→[0,1],βKrif(u)=1|U|∑x∈E,u∈UβK(x)χfK(x)(u)whereχfK(x)(u)=1,u∈fK(x)0,u∉fK(x)Here,αKrifandβKrifare called reduced-set operators of Krif. It is clear that Krifis an intuitionistic fuzzy set over U.⨿K∈IFPS(U) and Krifbe reduced intuitionistic fuzzy set of ⨿K. Then, a reduced fuzzy set of Krifis a fuzzy set over U, denoted by Krf, defined as follows:Krf=μKrf(u)/u:u∈UwhereμKrf:U→[0,1],μKrf(u)=αKrif(u)(1−βKrif(u))According to the problem, decision maker:i.Constructs a feasible intuitionistic fuzzy subsets K over the parameters set E based on a decision makers (DM) which is expert.Constructs an intuitionistic FP-soft set ⨿Kover the alternatives set U based on a DM.Computes the reduced intuitionistic fuzzy set Krifof ⨿K.Computes the reduced fuzzy set Krfof Krif.Chooses the element of Krfthat has maximum membership degree.Suppose that a workplace wants to fill a position. There are five candidates who fill in a form in order to apply formally for the position. There is a decision maker (DM), that is from the department of human resources.He want to interview the candidates, but it is very difficult to make it all of them. Therefore, by using the intuitionistic FP-soft decision making method, the number of candidates are reduced to a suitable one. Assume that the set of candidates U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5} which may be characterized by a set of parameters E={x1, x2, x3, x4} which is ″x1=experience″, ″x2=technical information″, ″x3=training″ and ″x4=age″. Now, we can apply the method as follows:Step i.Assume that DM constructs a feasible intuitionistic fuzzy subsets K over the parameters set E as;K={〈x1,0.7,0.3〉,〈x2,0.2,0.5〉,〈x3,0.5,0.5〉,〈x4,0.6,0.3〉}DM constructs an intuitionistic FP-soft set ⨿Kover the alternatives set U as;⨿K=(〈x1,0.7,0.3〉,{u1,u2,u4}),(〈x2,0.2,0.5〉,U),(〈x3,0.5,0.5〉,{u1,u2,u4}),(〈x4,0.6,0.3〉,{u2,u3})DM computes the reduced intuitionistic fuzzy set Krifof ⨿Kas;Krif=(〈u1,0.28,0.26〉,〈u2,0.40,0.32〉,〈u3,0.16,0.16〉,〈u4,0.28,0.32〉,〈u5,0.04,0.10〉DM computes the reduced fuzzy set Krfof Krifas;Krf=0.2072/u1,0.2720/u2,0.1344/u3,0.1904/u4,0.0360/u5Finally, DM chooses u2 for the position from Krfsince it has the maximum degree 0.2720 among the others.
