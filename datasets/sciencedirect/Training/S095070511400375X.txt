@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Knowledge reduction is a basic issue in knowledge representation and data mining. Although various methods have been developed to reduce the size of classical formal contexts, the reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on fuzzy lattices remains a difficult problem owing to its complicated derivation operators. To address this problem, we propose a general method of knowledge reduction by reducing attributes and objects in formal fuzzy contexts based on the variable threshold concept lattices. Employing the proposed approaches, we remove attributes and objects which are non-essential to the structure of a variable threshold concept lattice, i.e., with a given threshold level, the concept lattice constructed from a reduced formal context is made identical to that constructed from the original formal context. Discernibility matrices and Boolean functions are, respectively, employed to compute the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts, by which all the attribute reducts and object reducts of the formal fuzzy contexts are determined without changing the structure of the lattice.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The theory of formal concept analysis (FCA), proposed by Wille [11,32], stimulates mathematical approach to conceptual data analysis and knowledge processing. The main concern of FCA is the lattice structure, called a concept lattice, induced by a binary relation between a pair of sets constructed by the formal concepts embedded in a concept hierarchy. A formal concept is an (objects, attributes) pair, the set of objects is referred to as the extent of the concept consisting of all objects belong to the concept, and the set of attributes is called the intent of the concept that include all attributes shared by the objects. In the last two decades, FCA has been successfully applied to information retrieval, knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning, software engineering, etc. [5,6,8,10,15,16,18,21,22,24,30,39].FCA is formulated on the basis of a formal context, which is a binary relation between a set of objects and a set of attributes. Numerous theoretical investigations and practical applications of FCA have been made over the years. Extensions of FCA theory via fuzzy logic reasoning or fuzzy set theory also have been attempted in recent years. In real-life problems, formal fuzzy contexts are more common than their crisp counterparts. Binary fuzzy relations have been used to analyze relations between objects and attributes, and several generalizations to formal fuzzy concept have been made. For instance, Belohlavek [1–3] proposed fuzzy concepts in formal fuzzy contexts based on a residuated lattice, and the proposed fuzzy concept lattice hold almost all properties that in a classical concept lattice. Georgescu and Popescu [12,27] generalized Belohlavek’s definition of fuzzy concepts and discussed a general approach to fuzzy FCA. Medina and Ojeda-Aciego [25] developed so-called t-concept lattice as a set of triples associated to graded tabular information interpreted in a non-commutative fuzzy logic. Jaoua and Elloumi [14] extended the binary fuzzy relation to a real-set binary relation and introduced the corresponding Galois lattices. On the other hand, Krajči [16], Yahia and Jaoua [36] independently proposed a “one-sided fuzzy concept”, one advantage of their definitions is that the number of generated formal concepts is greatly reduced. Zhang et al. [40] further constructed the “variable threshold concept lattices”, i.e. crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concepts, in which the “one-sided fuzzy concept” becomes a special case (threshold being equal to 1).One of the main directions in the study of FCA is knowledge reduction achieved by reducing attributes and objects in formal contexts while keeping the lattice structures unchanged. Knowledge reduction is an important issue in knowledge representation and data mining [7,13,19,28,34,37,38]. Many types of knowledge reduction along the line of reducing attributes have been proposed for the analysis of information tables and decision tables. Since a formal context can be regarded as an information table, it is natural to consider knowledge reduction in FCA. In formal contexts, knowledge reduction is the search for a subset of attributes which can provide the same structure of the original concept lattice. In recent years, there have been a rapid growth of interests in knowledge reduction in classical formal contexts (object set and attribute set are crisp sets) [9,11,17,20,23,26,29,31,33,35,41].As we know, the number of formal concepts in a formal fuzzy context increases dramatically than that in a classical formal context. Hence, the structure of a concept lattice derived from a formal fuzzy context is more complicated than the one in a classical formal context. Thus the study of knowledge reduction in a formal fuzzy context becomes even more meaningful. By reduction, the concepts in a reduced fuzzy context have a simpler form, making the lattice a better representation of knowledge.Unfortunately, the methods of knowledge reduction for classical formal contexts are not applicable in the reduction of formal fuzzy contexts. The issues of knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts has recently attracted attention in the research community. Belohlavek et al. [4], for instance, proposed a method to reduce the number of formal fuzzy concepts by only keeping the so-called crisply generated fuzzy concepts which are generated from some crisp subset of attributes, leaving out non-crisply generated fuzzy concepts. In Belohlavek et al. reduction method [4], the number of fuzzy concepts and the hierarchy of the lattice are changed, resulting in a possible loss of knowledge. Based on the Lukasiewicz implication, Elloumi et al. [9] gave a multi-level conceptual data reduction approach via the reduction of the object sets by keeping the minimal rows in a formal context. However, we have noticed that some of the attributes are still redundant in the row reduced formal context, and Elloumi et al. did not consider eliminating the reducible attributes. Furthermore, based on the multi-level formal concepts (which do not form a lattice) proposed by Elloumi et al. [9], Li and Zhang [20] discussed the attribute characteristics by restricting them to the regular implication operators which satisfy the transitivity condition, and they presented a deletion algorithm to obtain a δ-reduct (not all δ-reducts).Compared to the classical formal contexts, very little research has been done on knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts. We are in lack of a general method for calculating knowledge reduction in formal fuzzy contexts parallel to that proposed by Zhang and Wei [41] for classical formal contexts. Based on the idea of variable threshold concept lattices, we propose in this paper a more general method to reduce the size of a formal fuzzy context without changing the structure of the lattice. Specifically, we construct appropriate discernibility matrices and discernibility functions to calculate the attribute (object) reducts in a formal fuzzy context by which all the attribute (object) reducts in the formal fuzzy context are determined. When δ=1, the proposed reduction approaches can be adapted to the “one-sided fuzzy concept”.The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review some basic notions of FCA and fuzzy logic relevant to the discussion throughout the paper. We also recall the variable threshold concepts introduced by Zhang et al. [40]. Section 3 proposes the approaches to attribute reducts and object reducts in formal fuzzy contexts. In Section 4, we define the discernibility matrices and Boolean functions to determine all reducts of a formal fuzzy context. We then conclude the paper with a summary and outline some future direction of research in Section 5.To facilitate our discussion, we first briefly recall some relevant notions of FCA and fuzzy logic, and then discuss some properties of the variable threshold concept lattices. Detailed information can be found in [11,1,40].The basic data set of FCA is a formal context, which is a triple(U,A,I), where U is a set of objects called the universe of discourse, A a set of features or attributes, and I a binary relation between U and A, which is a subset of the Cartesian productU×A, where(x,a)∈Imeans that object x has attribute a.A formal concept of(U,A,I)is a pair(X,B)of setsX⊆U(called extent) andB⊆A(called intent) such thatX=B∗andB=X∗, whereX∗={a∈A|∀x∈X,(x,a)∈I},B∗={x∈U|∀a∈B,(x,a)∈I}.The set of all formal concepts of(U,A,I)is denoted byL(U,A,I). For any(X1,B1),(X2,B2)∈L(U,A,I), partial order ⩽ is defined by(X1,B1)⩽(X2,B2)iffX1⊆X2(iffB2⊆B1).L(U,A,I)forms a complete lattice, the so-called concept lattice, in which the infimum and the supremum are given by(X1,B1)∧(X2,B2)=(X1∩X2,(B1∪B2)∗∗),(X1,B1)∨(X2,B2)=((X1∪X2)∗∗,B1∩B2).Definition 1[1,2]A residuated lattice is a structureL=(L,∨,∧,⊗,→,0,1)such that(1)(L,∨,∧,0,1)is a lattice with the least element 0 and the greatest element 1;(L,⊗,1)is a commutative monoid (i.e.⊗is commutative, associative, anda⊗1=1⊗a=afor eacha∈L);⊗,→form an adjoint pair, i.e.x⩽y→ziffx⊗y⩽zhold for allx,y,z∈L.In above definition, join∨and meet∧are supremum and infimum, multiplication⊗and residuum→are (truth functions of) “fuzzy conjunction” and “fuzzy implication” respectively. A common choice of L is a structure withL=[0,1],x∨y=max(x,y)andx∧y=min(x,y), and with three most important pairs of adjoint operations [1]: the Łukasiewicz one (x⊗y=max(x+y-1,0),x→y=min(1-x+y,1)), Gödel one(x⊗y=min(x,y),x→y=1ifx⩽yand=yelse), and product one(x⊗y=x·y,x→y=1ifx⩽yand=y/xelse).A residuated lattice(L,∨,∧,⊗,→,0,1)is called complete if(L,∨,∧)is a complete lattice. For convenience, we write a residuated latticeL=(L,∨,∧,⊗,→,0,1)asL.In what follows, the complete residuated lattice(L,∨,∧,⊗,→,0,1)is fixed with the supporting set [0,1], i.e.L=[0,1]. The notion of a residuated lattice provides a very general truth structure for fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory.LetLbe a residuated lattice and U a nonempty set. A mappingA:U→Lis referred to as aL-set of U, andA(x)is interpreted as the truth degree of the fact “x belongs to A” for anyx∈U. ByLUwe denote the set of allL-sets of U. The empty set∅and the universe set inLUare denoted by0‾Uand1‾U, respectively. ForX1,X2∈LU,X1⊆X2if and only ifX1(x)⩽X2(x)for allx∈U. Operations∧and∨onLUare, respectively, defined as follows:(X1∧X2)(x)=X1(x)∧X2(x),(X1∨X2)(x)=X1(x)∨X2(x),∀x∈U.Similar to the classical situation, a formal fuzzy context is a triple(U,A,I∼), where U and A are, respectively, the object set and attribute set, andI∼∈LU×Ais aL-fuzzy relation between U and A. The following illustrative example is an extension of the formal fuzzy context in [9].Example 1Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context withU={x1,x2,x3,x4},A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}, and the fuzzy relationI∼is defined as Table 1. Let→be the Łukasiewicz implication operator, i.e.(1)x→y=min(1-x+y,1),x⊗y=max(x+y-1,0).Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context and0<δ⩽1. ForX∈P(U),B∼∈LA, the operators▽δ:P(U)→LAand△δ:LA→P(U)are defined as follows:(2)X▽δ(a)=δ→⋀x∈XI∼(x,a),a∈A,B∼△δ=x∈U|⋀a∈A(B∼(a)→I∼(x,a))⩾δ.By Definition 2, it is straightforward to conclude the following property:Property 1Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context,X,X1,X2,Xi∈P(U), andB∼,B∼1,B∼2,B∼i∈LA,i∈J, J is an index set. Then(i)X1⊆X2⇒X2▽δ⊆X1▽δ,B∼1⊆B∼2⇒B∼2△δ⊆B∼1△δ;(ii)X⊆X▽δ△δ,B∼⊆B∼△δ▽δ;(iii)X▽δ=X▽δ△δ▽δ,B∼△δ=B∼△δ▽δ△δ;(iv)⋃i∈JXi▽δ=⋂i∈JXi▽δ,⋃i∈JB∼i△δ=⋂i∈JB∼i△δ.For the objects subset X,X▽δ∈LA, i.e.X▽δis aL-set of A andX▽δ(a)is the truth degree of “a is shared by all objects in X with threshold δ”. In duality, for aL-setB∼of A,B∼△δcomputes the set of all objects which satisfy all properties inB∼at a given threshold δ. Operators▽δand△δrepresent a fuzzy Galois connection between the subsets X andB∼.For a formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼), a pair(X,B∼)∈P(U)×LAsatisfyingX=B∼△δandB∼=X▽δis called a crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept of(U,A,I∼)(see [40]). For a set of objectsX∈P(U)and a fuzzy set of attributesB∼∈LA, from Property 1 (iii) it can easily be verified that both(X▽δ△δ,X▽δ)and(B∼△δ,B∼△δ▽δ)are crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts. For two crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts(X1,B∼1)and(X2,B∼2),(X1,B∼1)⩽(X2,B∼2)if and only ifX1⊆X2(or equivalently,B∼2⊆B∼1). All the crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts of(U,A,I∼)form a complete lattice and is denoted asLδ(U,A∼,I∼), in which the infimum∧and the supremum∨are defined respectively as follows:(X1,B∼1)∧(X2,B∼2)=(X1∩X2,(B∼1∪B∼2)△δ▽δ)=(X1∩X2,(X1∩X2)▽δ);(X1,B∼1)∨(X2,B∼2)=((X1∪X2)▽δ△δ,B∼1∩B∼2)=((B∼1∩B∼2)△δ,B∼1∩B∼2).The introduction of the parameter δ allows us to introduce different levels to the generated fuzzy concepts. It plays the role of a threshold which enables us to reduce the number of formal concepts in a given formal fuzzy context, i.e., when δ varies from 1 to 0 we obtain a reduction of the number of the fuzzy concepts. In fact, when δ decreases, some fuzzy concepts will not be considered since they will be included in some larger concepts.By exchanging objects and attributes in the definition of a crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept, one can define the following corresponding adjoint pair of derivation operators and fuzzy concepts.Definition 3[40]Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context and0<δ⩽1. ForX∼∈LU,B∈P(A), the operators△δ:LU→P(A)and▽δ:P(A)→LUare defined as follows:(3)X∼△δ=a∈A|⋀x∈U(X∼(x)→I∼(x,a))⩾δ,B▽δ(x)=δ→⋀a∈BI∼(x,a),x∈U.Similar to Property 1, operators▽δand△δin Definition 3 satisfy the following property:Property 2Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context,X∼,X∼1,X∼2,X∼i∈LU, andB,B1,B2,Bi∈P(A),i∈J,Jis an index set. Then(i)X∼1⊆X∼2⇒X∼2△δ⊆X∼1△δ,B1⊆B2⇒B2▽δ⊆B1▽δ;(ii)X∼⊆X∼△δ▽δ,B⊆B▽δ△δ;(iii)X∼△δ=X∼△δ▽δ△δ,B▽δ=B▽δ△δ▽δ;(iv)⋃i∈JX∼i△δ=⋂i∈JX∼i△δ,⋃i∈JBi▽δ=⋂i∈JBi▽δ.Likewise, for aL-setX∼ofU,X∼△δcomputes the set of all attributes which is possessed by all objects inX∼at a given threshold δ. In duality, for the attributes subsetB,B▽δ∈LU, i.e.B▽δis aL-set of U andB▽δ(x)is the truth degree of “x satisfy all properties in B with threshold δ”. Also, operators△δand▽δrepresent a fuzzy Galois connection between the subsets X andB∼.A pair(X∼,B)∈LU×P(A)is called a fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept of(U,A,I∼)ifX∼=B▽δandB=X∼△δ(see [40]). Similar to crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concepts, we can define the partial order relation⩽, the infimum∧and the supremum∨on two fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concepts. Thus, all the fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concepts of(U,A,I∼)also form a complete lattice which is denoted asLδ(U∼,A,I∼).Krajči [16], Yahia and Jaoua [36] independently constructed fuzzy concepts between a crisp set and a fuzzy set that do not include the implication operator. Their derivation operators are defined as follows:Definition 4[16,36]Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. ForX∈P(U),B∼∈LA, the operatorsf:P(U)→LAandg:LA→P(U)are defined respectively as follows:(4)f(X)(a)=⋀x∈XI∼(x,a),a∈A,g(B∼)={x∈U|∀a∈A,B∼(a)⩽I∼(x,a)}.Note thatf(X)andg(B∼)have the similar physical meaning as that ofX▽δandB∼△δdiscussed in Remark 1.By Definition 4, one can conclude the following property:Property 3Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context,X,X1,X2,Xi∈P(U), andB∼,B∼1,B∼2,B∼i∈LA,i∈J,Jis an index set. Then(i)X1⊆X2⇒f(X2)⊆f(X1),B∼1⊆B∼2⇒g(B∼2)⊆g(B∼1);(ii)X⊆g∘f(X),B∼⊆f∘g(B∼);(iii)f(X)=f∘g∘f(X),g(B∼)=g∘f∘g(B∼);(iv)f⋃i∈JXi=⋂i∈Jf(Xi),g⋃i∈JB∼i=⋂i∈Jg(B∼i).For a formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼), a pair(X,B∼)∈P(U)×LAsatisfyingX=g(B∼)andB∼=f(X)is called a crisp-fuzzy concept of(U,A,I∼)(see [16,36]). For a set of objectsX∈P(U)and a fuzzy set of attributesB∼∈LA, from Property 3 (iii), we can observe that both(g∘f(X),f(X))and(g(B∼),f∘g(B∼))are crisp-fuzzy concepts. For two crisp-fuzzy concepts(X1,B∼1)and(X2,B∼2),(X1,B∼1)⩽(X2,B∼2)if and only ifX1⊆X2(or equivalently,B∼2⊆B∼1). All the crisp-fuzzy concepts of(U,A,I∼)form a complete lattice and is denoted asL1(U,A∼,I∼), in which the infimum and the supremum are defined as follows:(X1,B∼1)∧(X2,B∼2)=(X1∩X2,f∘g(B∼1∪B∼2))=(X1∩X2,f(X1∩X2));(X1,B∼1)∨(X2,B∼2)=(g∘f(X1∪X2),B∼1∩B∼2)=(g(B∼1∩B∼2),B∼1∩B∼2).If we exchange the objects and attributes in Definition 4, we obtain operatorsg:LU→P(A)andf:P(A)→LUdefined forX∼∈LUandB∈P(A)by:(5)g(X∼)={a∈A|∀x∈U,X∼(x)⩽I∼(x,a)},f(B)(x)=⋀a∈BI∼(x,a),x∈U.Accordingly, operators f and g in Eq. (5) have the analogous properties as presented in Property 3. And furthermore, we can define the corresponding fuzzy-crisp concepts and fuzzy-crisp concept lattices.When δ=1, Eq. (2) degenerates into Eqs. (4) and (3) degenerates into Eq. (5). It should be noted that a crisp-fuzzy concept is a particular case of a crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept with thresholdδ=1. And similarly, a fuzzy-crisp concept is a particular case of a fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept with thresholdδ=1.Example 2Continuing from Example 1, Tables 2 and 3represent, respectively, all the crisp-fuzzy concepts and all the fuzzy-crisp concepts with thresholdδ=1. Thus, Tables 2 and 3 also show all the crisp-fuzzy concepts and all the fuzzy-crisp concepts determined by operators f and g. Tables 4 and 6represent all the crisp-fuzzy concepts with thresholdδ=0.8andδ=0.6respectively. Tables at>5–7represent all the fuzzy-crisp concepts with thresholdδ=0.8andδ=0.6respectively. For simplicity, we show only the computing of crisp-fuzzy concept({x1}▽δ△δ,{x1}▽δ)with thresholdδ=0.8and other concepts can be obtained likewise. By Eqs. (1) and (2) we have{x1}▽δ(a1)=0.8→I∼(x1,a1)=0.8→0.5=0.7,{x1}▽δ(a2)=0.8→I∼(x1,a2)=0.8→0.7=0.9,{x1}▽δ(a3)=0.8→I∼(x1,a3)=0.8→0.7=0.9,{x1}▽δ(a4)=0.8→I∼(x1,a4)=0.8→0.5=0.7,{x1}▽δ(a5)=0.8→I∼(x1,a5)=0.8→0.7=0.9,by Eq. (2) we have{x1}▽δ△δ=x∈U|⋀ai∈A({x1}▽δ(ai)→I∼(x,ai))⩾0.8={x1,x2}.Thus,({x1}▽δ△δ,{x1}▽δ)=({x1,x2},{a10.7,a20.9,a30.9,a40.7,a50.9}).Based on the notions of crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices, we first present some notions of reduction of formal fuzzy contexts, and then give an approach to reduction, followed by some methods for judging attribute characteristics.Definition 5LetLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)andLδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)be two crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices. We say thatLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)is extent thinner thanLδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)if for each(X,B∼)∈Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2), there existsB∼′⊆A∼1such that(X,B∼′)∈Lδ(U,A∼1,I∼1), and denoteLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)⩽Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2).IfLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)⩽Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)andLδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)⩽Lδ(U,A∼1,I∼1), we say thatLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)andLδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)are isomorphic, and denote it asLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)≅Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2).We denoteLδU(U,A∼,I∼)the set of all extensions of the crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept latticeLδ(U,A∼,I∼), i.e.,LδU(U,A∼,I∼)={X⊆U|(X,B∼)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)}.Theorem 1LetLδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)andLδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)be two crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices. Then(1)Lδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)⩽Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)iffLδU(U,A∼2,I∼2)⊆LδU(U,A∼1,I∼1);Lδ(U,A∼1,I∼1)≅Lδ(U,A∼2,I∼2)iffLδU(U,A∼1,I∼1)=LδU(U,A∼2,I∼2).It follows immediately from Definition 5.□LetB∼∈LAandD⊆A. ByB∼|Dwe denote the L-set defined on D such that(B∼|D)(b)=B∼(b)for allb∈D. It is obvious thatB∼|Dis the restriction ofB∼on the set D.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. Its sub-context is referred to formal fuzzy context(U,C,I∼C), whereC⊆AandI∼C=I∼∩(U×C). Note thatI∼Cis a L-set defined onU×C. In order to avoid confusion, by▽δCand△δCwe denote derivation operators▽δand△δfor context(U,C,I∼C), respectively.Property 4Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andC⊆A. Then,X▽δ△δ⊆X▽δC△δC,∀X⊆UFor anyx∈X▽δ△δ, by Eq. (2) we havex∈X▽δ△δ⇔∀a∈A,X▽δ(a)→I∼(x,a)⩾δ⇒∀c∈C,(X▽δ|C)(a)→I∼(x,a)⩾δ⇔x∈X▽δC△δC.Therefore,X▽δ△δ⊆X▽δC△δC. □Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. ThenLδ(U,A∼,I∼)⩽Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D)for allD⊆AwithD≠∅.For anyD⊆AwithD≠∅, if(X,B∼)∈Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D), it is evident that(X▽δ△δ,X▽δ)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼). We only need to proveX▽δ△δ=X. In fact, from Property 1 (ii), we haveX⊆X▽δ△δ. On the other hand, sinceX▽δD△δD=B∼△δD=X, then we haveX▽δD△δD⊆X⊆X▽δ△δ. By Property 4 we conclude thatX▽δ△δ=X. Hence,Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)⩽Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D). □Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context anda∈A. We say that a is a dispensable attribute with threshold δ ifLδ(U,A∼,I∼)≅Lδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a});otherwise, a is said to be indispensable with threshold δ.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context anda∈A. Then a is dispensable with threshold δ if and only if for any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)there existsb∈A-{a}such thatB∼1(b)≠B∼2(b).(⇒)Assume that a is dispensable with threshold δ. If there exist(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatB∼1(b)=B∼2(b)for allb∈A-{a}, then we have(B∼1|A-{a})△δA-{a}=(B∼2|A-{a})△δA-{a}.Hence,LδU(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})⊂LδU(U,A∼,I∼).By Theorem 1, we conclude thatLδ(U,A∼,I∼)≇L(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a}),which is a contradiction to the assumption that a is a dispensable attribute with threshold δ. Therefore, for any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), there must existb∈A-{a}such thatB∼1(b)≠B∼2(b).(⇐)By Theorem 2, we haveLδ(U,A∼,I∼)⩽Lδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a}). Then we only need to proveLδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})⩽Lδ(U,A∼,I∼).By Theorem 1, we need to proveLδU(U,A∼,I∼)⊆LU(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a}).In fact, for any(X,B∼)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), from Property 1 (iii) we have((B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a},(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δA-{a})∈Lδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a}).Now, we prove(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}=X. If(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}≠X, thenX⊂(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}. SinceLδU(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})⊆LδU(U,A∼,I∼),we have(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}∈LδU(U,A∼,I∼),that is,((B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a},(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼).For anyb∈A-{a}, since(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ(b)=(X▽δA-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ(b)=(X▽δA-{a})△δA-{a}▽δA-{a}(b)=(X▽δA-{a})(b)=(B∼|A-{a})(b)thus, we haveB∼(a)>(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ(a),B∼(b)=(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ(b),∀b∈A-{a}.It conflicts with the assumption that there existsb∈A-{a}such thatB∼1(b)≠B∼2(b)for any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), since(X,B∼),((B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a},(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}▽δ)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼). Hence, we obtain(B∼|A-{a})△δA-{a}=X.Consequently,LδU(U,A∼,I∼)⊆LδU(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a}).Therefore,LδU(U,A∼,I∼)=LδU(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})and a is dispensable.□From Table 2, it can easily be verified that, for any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), there existsai∈A-{a2}such thatB∼1(ai)≠B∼2(ai). Hence,a2is dispensable with thresholdδ=1.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context anda∈A. Then a is indispensable with threshold δ if and only if there exist(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatB∼1(b)=B∼2(b)for allb∈A-{a}.It follows immediately from Theorem 3.□According to the significance of the attributes, the attribute set A is divided into two parts, i.e. dispensable attribute set and indispensable attribute set, and the two sets are complementary. By Theorems 3 and 4 we can determine all the dispensable attributes and all the indispensable attributes, respectively. One can also use Theorem 3 to determine all the indispensable attributes and use Theorem 4 to determine all the dispensable attributes. In a sense, Theorems 3 and 4 can be seen as complementary.Example 4In Table 2, since there exist({x1,x2,x3,x4},{a10.5,a20.7,a30.7,a40.1,a50.7}),({x1,x2},{a10.5,a20,7,a30.7,a40.5,a50.7})∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatB∼1(a4)≠B∼2(a4)andB∼1(ai)=B∼2(ai)for allai∈A-{a4}, then we conclude thata4is an indispensable attribute with thresholdδ=1.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andD⊆A. We say that D is an attribute consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ ifLδ(U,A∼,I∼)≅Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D). Furthermore, if D is an attribute consistent set of(U,A,I∼), and no proper subset of D is an attribute consistent set of(U,A,I∼), i.e. for anyb∈D,Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)≇Lδ(U,D∼-{b},I∼D-{b}), then we say D is an attribute reduct of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ.The reduct exists for any formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼). In fact, A itself is its reduct, ifLδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})≇Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)for anya∈A. If there existsa∈Asuch thatLδ(U,A-{a}∼,I∼A-{a})≅Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), we setB1=A-{a}. Afterwards,B1is a reduct ifLδ(U,B1-{b}∼,I∼B1-{b})≇Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)for anyb∈B1; otherwise, we setB2=B1-{b}. After the iterations, we can obtain at least one reduct since A is a finite set.Example 5In Example 1, letδ=1and Table 8represents all the crisp-fuzzy concepts of context(U,{a1,a3,a4}∼,I∼{a1,a3,a4}). It can be verified thatLδ(U,A∼,I∼)≅Lδ(U,{a1,a3,a4}∼,I∼{a1,a3,a4}).Then{a1,a3,a4}is an attribute consistent set with thresholdδ=1. And for anyC⊂{a1,a3,a4}, it can be verified thatLδ(U,A∼,I∼)≇Lδ(U,C∼,I∼C). Thus,{a1,a3,a4}is an attribute reduct of(U,A,I∼)with thresholdδ=1.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andD⊆A. Then D is a consistent set with threshold δ iffLδ(U,D∼,I∼D)⩽Lδ(U,A∼,I∼).It follows directly from Definition 7 and Theorem 2.□Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andD⊆A. Then D is an attribute consistent set with threshold δ iff for any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), there existsb∈Dsuch thatB∼1(b)≠B∼2(b).(⇒)Assume that D is an attribute consistent set with threshold δ. If there exist(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatB∼1(b)=B∼2(b)for allb∈D, then((B∼1|D)△δD,(B∼1|D)△δD▽δD)=((B∼2|D)△δD,(B∼2|D)△δD▽δD).Hence,LδU(U,D∼,I∼D)⊂LδU(U,A∼,I∼), which contradicts the assumption.(⇐)For any(X1,B∼1),(X2,B∼2)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), we have((B∼1|D)△δD,(B∼1|D)△δD▽δD),((B∼2|D)△δD,(B∼2|D)△δD▽δD)∈Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D).By the assumption, we can findb∈Dsuch thatB∼1(b)≠B∼2(b). Then, by Theorem 4, we conclude that(B∼1|D)△δD≠(B∼2|D)△δD, which impliesLδU(U,D∼,I∼D)=LδU(U,A∼,I∼).Therefore, D is an attribute consistent set with threshold δ.□Theorem 5 presents an approach to judge whether or not an attribute set is consistent.In duality, one can consider object reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices, and the corresponding theorems and proposition can be obtained likewise. Since there are some differences, we just present some important conclusions.Definition 8LetLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)andLδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)be two fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices. We say thatLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)is intention thinner thanLδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)if for any(X∼,B)∈Lδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)there existsX∼′⊆LU1such that(X∼′,B)∈Lδ(U∼1,A,I∼1), and denote it asLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)⩽Lδ(U∼2,A,I∼2). IfLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)⩽Lδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)andLδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)⩽Lδ(U∼1,A,I∼1), we sayLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)andLδ(U∼2,A,I∼2)are isomorphic, and denote it asLδ(U∼1,A,I∼1)≅Lδ(U∼2,A,I∼2).Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. ThenLδ(U∼,A,I∼)⩽Lδ(Y∼,A,I∼Y)for allY⊆UwithY≠∅.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andx∈U. We say that x is a dispensable object with threshold δ ifLδ(U∼,A,I∼)≅Lδ((U-{x})∼,A,I∼U-{x})).Otherwise, x is said to be indispensable with threshold δ.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andx∈U. Then x is dispensable with threshold δ iff for any(X∼1,B1),(X∼2,B2)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼)there existsy∈U-{x}such thatX∼1(y)≠X∼2(y).Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andx∈U. Then x is indispensable with threshold δ iff there exist(X∼1,B1),(X∼2,B2)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼)such thatX∼1(y)=X∼2(y)for ally∈U-{x}.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andZ⊆U. We say that Z is an object consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ ifLδ(U∼,A,I∼)≅Lδ(Z∼,A,I∼Z). Furthermore, if Z is an object consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ and no proper subset of Z is an object consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ, i.e.Lδ(U∼,A,I∼)≇Lδ(Z-{z}∼,A,I∼Z-{z})for allz∈Z, then we say that Z is an object reduct of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andZ⊆U. Then Z is an object consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ iffLδ(Z∼,A,I∼Z)⩽Lδ(U∼,A,I∼).Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andZ⊆U. Then Z is an object consistent set with threshold δ iff for any(X∼1,B1),(X∼2,B2)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼)there existsy∈Zsuch thatX∼1(y)≠X∼2(y).Theorem 9 presents an approach to judge whether or not an object set is a consistent set.As we know, discernibility matrices and discernibility functions are useful tools in the calculation of all reducts of an information system in rough set theory. In the literature [41], the discernibility matrix and discernibility function are employed to compute attribute reduction in classical concept lattices. In order to determine all attribute reducts and all object reducts, we construct in this section appropriate discernibility matrices and discernibility functions of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattices and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices.Definition 11Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context,0<δ⩽1, and(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼). DenoteDδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))={a∈A|B∼i(a)≠B∼j(a)}.Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))is called the attribute discernibility set of(Xi,B∼i)and(Xj,B∼j)with threshold δ in(U,A,I∼), andDAδ=(Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))|(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼))is referred to as the attribute discernibility matrix of(U,A∼,I∼)with threshold δ, andDAδ((Xi,B∼i))=(Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))|(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼))is referred to as the relative attribute discernibility matrix of(Xi,B∼i)with threshold δ.In Table 2, we consider the attribute discernibility set of conceptsFC3andFC4. ByB∼1andB∼2we denote the intents ofFC3andFC4respectively. SinceB∼1(a1)≠B∼2(a1),B∼1(a2)=B∼2(a2),B∼1(a3)≠B∼2(a3),B∼1(a4)≠B∼2(a4)andB∼1(a5)≠B∼2(a5), thus,Dδ(FC3,FC4)={a1,a3,a4,a5}.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context,0<δ⩽1, and(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j),(Xk,B∼k)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼). Then(1)Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xi,B∼i))=∅;Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))=Dδ((Xj,B∼j),(Xi,B∼i));Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))⊆Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xk,B∼k))∪Dδ((Xk,B∼k),(Xj,B∼j)).(1) and (2) follow directly from Definition 11.(3) For anya∈Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)), ifa∉Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xk,B∼k)), thenB∼i(a)=B∼k(a). SinceB∼i(a)≠B∼j(a), we haveB∼j(a)≠B∼k(a). Thus,a∈Dδ((Xk,B∼k),(Xj,B∼j)).Therefore,Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))⊆Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xk,B∼k))∪Dδ((Xk,B∼k),(Xj,B∼j)).□Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andD⊆AwithD≠∅. Then D is an attribute consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ iffD∩Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠∅for all(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼).(⇒)For any(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), since D is a consistent set, we have(Xi,B∼i|D),(Xj,B∼j|D)∈Lδ(U,D∼,I∼D). Note that(Xi,B∼i|D)≠(Xj,B∼j|D)and there existsa∈Dsuch that(B∼i|D)(a)≠(B∼j|D)(a). Therefore,D∩Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠∅.(⇐)SinceD∩Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠∅, then there existsb∈Dsuch thatB∼i(b)≠B∼j(b). Thus, by Theorem 5, we conclude that D is an attribute consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ.□From Theorem 11 we can conclude that an attribute reduct in(U,A,I∼)is a minimal subset B of A such thatB∩Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠∅(∀(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)).Theorem 11 provides an approach to judge whether or not a subset of attributes is a consistent set.Theorem 12Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context anda∈A. Then a is indispensable with threshold δ iff there exist(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatDδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))={a}.(⇒)Assume that a is indispensable with threshold δ. If for any(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼),Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠{a}holds. Then(A-{a})∩Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))≠∅. Hence, by Theorem 11, we conclude thatA-{a}is a consistent set with threshold δ, which contradicts the assumption.(⇐)Assume that there exist(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼)such thatDδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))={a}. Then we haveB∼1(a)≠B∼2(a)andB∼1(b)=B∼2(b)for allb∈A-{a}. Thus, by Theorem 3, we conclude that a is an indispensable attribute.□LetDAδbe the attribute discernibility matrix of(U,A,I∼)and(Xi,B∼i)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼), we denoteMAδ=⋀⋁Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))|(Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼),MAδ((Xi,B∼i))=⋀⋁Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))|(Xj,B∼j)∈Lδ(U,A∼,I∼).MAδis referred to as the discernibility function of(U,A,I∼)with thresholdδ,MAδ((Xi,B∼i))is referred to as the relative discernibility function of(Xi,B∼i)with threshold δ (where, a relative reduct for(Xi,B∼i)is a minimal attribute subset that distinguishes concept(Xi,B∼i)from other concepts).Theorem 13Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. If the minimal disjunctive normal forms of each attribute discernibility functionMAδandMAδ((Xi,B∼i))areMAδ=⋁k=1t⋀s=1qkasandMAδ((Xi,B∼i))=⋁m=1n⋀s=1qmbs,letMAkδ={as|s=1,2,…,qk}andMAmδ((Xi,B∼i))={bs|s=1,2,…,qm}. Then{MAkδ|k=1,2,…,t}is the set of all attribute reducts in(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ, and{MAmδ((Xi,B∼i))|m=1,2,…,n}is the set of all relative attribute reducts of(Xi,B∼i)with threshold δ.It follows directly from Theorem 11 and the definition of minimal disjunctive normal form of the discernibility function.□It should be noted that discernibility functions are monotonic Boolean functions and their prime implications uniquely determine the reducts.Theorem 13 provides a practical approach to determine all attribute reducts of a formal fuzzy context.Example 7Tables 9 and 10present, respectively, the attribute discernibility matrix of(U,A,I∼)of Example 1 whenδ=1andδ=0.8. According to Table 9, we haveMA1=a4∧(a1∨a2)∧(a2∨a4)∧(a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a2∨a4)∧(a1∨a3∨a5)∧(a3∨a4∨a5)∧(a1∨a2∨a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a3∨a4∨a5)∧(a2∨a3∨a4∨a5)∧A=a4∧(a1∨a2)∧(a3∨a5)=(a1∧a3∧a4)∨(a1∧a4∧a5)∨(a2∧a3∧a4)∨(a2∧a4∧a5).Thus,{a1,a3,a4},{a1,a4,a5},{a2,a3,a4}and{a2,a4,a5}are attribute reducts in(U,A,I∼)with thresholdδ=1, anda4is an indispensable attribute. Tables 8, 11, 12 and 13represent the reduced formal fuzzy contexts(U,{a1,a3,a4},I∼{a1,a3,a4}),(U,{a1,a4,a5},I∼{a1,a4,a5}),(U,{a2,a3,a4},I∼{a2,a3,a4})and(U,{a2,a4,a5},I∼{a2,a4,a5})respectively. We can obtain the same crisp-fuzzy concept structure from the reduced formal fuzzy contexts.In Table 2, we take crisp-fuzzy concept FC3. From Table 9, we haveMA1(FC3)=a4∧(a1∨a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a3∨a4∨a5)∧A=(a1∧a4)∨(a3∧a4)∨(a4∧a5).Then{a1,a4},{a3,a4}and{a4,a5}are relative reducts of crisp-fuzzy concept FC3 with thresholdδ=1.From Table 10, we haveMA0.8=a4∧(a1∨a2)∧(a1∨a2∨a4)∧(a1∨a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a2∨a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a3∨a4∨a5)∧A=(a1∧a4)∨(a2∧a3∧a4)∨(a2∧a4∧a5).Thus,{a1,a4},{a2,a3,a4}and{a2,a4,a5}are attribute reducts of(U,A,I∼)with thresholdδ=0.8, and d is the unique indispensable attribute. Tables 14–16represent the reduced formal fuzzy contexts(U,{a1,a4},I∼{a1,a4}),(U,{a2,a3,a4},I∼{a2,a3,a4})and(U,{a2,a4,a5},I∼{a2,a4,a5})respectively. We have the same crisp-fuzzy concept structure from the reduced formal fuzzy contexts.In Table 4, we take crisp-fuzzy concept FC3. From Table 10, we haveMA0.8(FC3)=a4∧(a1∨a3∨a5)∧(a1∨a3∨a4∨a5))∧A=(a1∧a4)∨(a3∧a4)∨(a4∧a5).Then{a1,a4},{a3,a4}and{a4,a5}are relative reducts of crisp-fuzzy concept FC3 with thresholdδ=0.8.By Theorem 13, the procedure for computing attribute reducts can be summarized as Algorithm 1, and the procedure for computing relative reducts can be summarized as Algorithm 2.Algorithm 1Computing all attribute reducts of a formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼)Input:A formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼);Output:REDA(U,A,I∼)// the set of attribute reducts.1:ComputeLδ(U,A∼,I∼);2:Compute the attribute discernibility matrixDAδ;3:ComputeMAδ=⋀Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))∈DAδ⋁Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j));4:ComputeMAδ=∨k=1t(∧s=1qkas);5:LetCk={as|s⩽qk}andREDA(U,A,I∼)={Ck|k⩽t};6:OutputREDA(U,A,I∼).Computing relative reducts for crisp-fuzzy concept(Xi,B∼i)Input:A formal fuzzy context(U,A,I∼)and crisp-fuzzy concept(Xi,B∼i);Output:REDA((Xi,B∼i))// the set of relative reducts of(Xi,B∼i).1:ComputeLδ(U,A∼,I∼);2:Compute the relative discernibility matrixDAδ((Xi,B∼i));3:ComputeMAδ((Xi,B∼i))=⋀Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j))∈DAδ⋁Dδ((Xi,B∼i),(Xj,B∼j));4:ComputeMAδ((Xi,B∼i))=∨m=1n(∧s=1qmbs);5:LetCm={bs|s⩽qm}andREDA((Xi,B∼i))={Cm|m⩽n};6:OutputREDA((Xi,B∼i)).The number of crisp-fuzzy concepts derived from the reduced formal fuzzy context is identical to that derived from the original formal fuzzy context. For example, from Table 14 we obtain all the crisp-fuzzy concepts with thresholdδ=0.8and represent them by Table 17. Compared with the crisp-fuzzy concepts in Table 4, the crisp-fuzzy concepts in Table 17 have a simpler form, making it a better representation of knowledge.Similarly, one can consider the object discernibility matrix and discernibility function based on the fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattices. The corresponding theorems and proposition can be analogously obtained and we therefore just present some important conclusions.Definition 12Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context, and(X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼). DenoteDδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))={x∈U|X∼i(x)≠X∼j(x)},Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))is called the discernibility object set of(X∼i,Bi)and(X∼j,Bj), andDOδ=(Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))|(X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼))is referred to as the object discernibility matrix of(U,A∼,I∼)with threshold δ, andDAδ((X∼i,Bi))=(Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))|(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼))is referred to as the relative object discernibility matrix of(X∼i,Bi)with threshold δ.Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context, andZ⊆UwithZ≠∅. Then Z is an object consistent set of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ iffZ∩Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))≠∅for all(X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼).Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context andx∈U. Then x is indispensable with threshold δ iff there exist(X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼))such thatDδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))={x}.LetDOδbe the object discernibility matrix of(U,A,I∼), we denoteMOδ=⋀⋁Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))|(X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼),MOδ((X∼i,Bi))=⋀⋁Dδ((X∼i,Bi),(X∼j,Bj))|(X∼j,Bj)∈Lδ(U∼,A,I∼).MOδis referred to as the object discernibility function of(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ, andMOδ((X∼i,Bi))is referred to as the relative discernibility function of(X∼i,Bi)with threshold δ.Theorem 16Let(U,A,I∼)be a formal fuzzy context. If the minimal disjunctive normal forms of each object discernibility functionMOδandMOδ((X∼i,Bi))areMOδ=⋁k=1t⋀s=1qkxsandMOδ((X∼i,Bi))=⋁m=1n⋀s=1qmxs,letMOkδ={xs|s=1,2,…,qk}andMOmδ((X∼i,Bi))={xs|s=1,2,…,qm}. Then{MOkδ|k=1,2,…,t}is the set of all object reducts in(U,A,I∼)with threshold δ, and{MOmδ((X∼i,Bi))|m=1,2,…,n}is the set of all relative object reducts of(X∼i,Bi)with threshold δ.By Theorem 16, the corresponding algorithms for computing all object reducts and all relative reducts can be obtained likewise.The above reduction approaches of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy variable threshold concept lattice and fuzzy-crisp variable threshold concept lattice can also be applied to attribute reduction and object reduction of formal fuzzy contexts based on crisp-fuzzy concept lattice and fuzzy-crisp concept lattice introduced by Krajči [16], Yahia and Jaoua [36].
