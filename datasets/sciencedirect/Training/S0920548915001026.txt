@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a study of the collective knowledge in information technology (IT) and the comparative analyses of innovative trends in the standardisation of the roads of knowledge in the subfields of software engineering (SE).The focus is on the amount of required innovation that will be necessary in the examples database of standardised units in IT and SE for the improvement of the information systems (IS). The goal is to determine how to obtain appropriate knowledge in IT and SE to model the excellence of IS.The contribution to the modelling of IS excellence in PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The paper investigates standardised collective knowledge in information technology (IT), especially in the subfields of software enginerring (SE) and (information systems) IS. IS is “An information processing system, together with associated organisational resources such as human, technical, and financial resources, that provides and distributes information” [1] (terms noted in italics are standardised). The term “collective knowledge” is defined by standardised term “knowledge source” — a source of information from which a knowledge base has been created for a specific kind of problem [2]. Sources of information for collective knowledge are the ISO/IEC standards (International Organization for Standardization (IScxxO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)) [3], SRPS standards (SRPS — designation of standards in Serbia) and sources of information for local knowledge [4]. Knowledge base (or K-base or KB) is abbreviated in the vocabulary [1] (01.06.18) and in [2] (28.04.06) – in IT Vocabulary – part 28th, Section 4, term 6. In the present century in IT, we have witnessed the growing problem of continuous improvement in individual knowledge in relation to evolved and standardised knowledge (partly public and collective). One aspect of the problem is knowledge acquisition, continuous improvement of the quality of the product (education services), a second is based on knowledge representation[1,5], and a third refers to the quantity and value of the required knowledge engineering. On a more practical level, according to the International Classification of Standards (ICS) from a population of standards in all areas for ICS-1 (from 1 up to 99), they may include sub/fields such as:–The evolutions of IT standardisation to E-learning (ICS-3=35.240.99), that had not been published previously,The evolution of studies of the SE discipline (ICS-2=35.080), to IS excellence,The future trends defined in boundaries and subfields of IT, SE to IS, as a product.Today it is not a “problem” to develop IS. Manipulation of information in some integrated IS and creation of “our own” public opinion (including standardisation of design and implementation [6]) is more important. The research presented in this paper relates to the trend analyses of the innovation intensity of knowledge sources (KSs) [2] and the required individual knowledge.Decision-making “problems” based on IS and/or expert systems (ESs) is not completely new. An ES, is “a Knowledge-Based System — KBS, that provides solving problems in a particular domain or application area by drawing inferences from a knowledge base developed from human expertise” [2,1] (Domain Knowledge — DK is “knowledge accumulated in a particular domain” [2]). Comparing collective with individual decision making, the first involves expert knowledge kept in store as the knowledge base to solve the “problem” in the domain of the broader collective knowledge. Expanding the applications of SE constantly extends the gap between collective and individual knowledge. The implementation of IS and SE, will make the distance between collective and individual knowledge smaller. The possibilities of applying the excellence model in making management decisions in educational institutions were demonstrated by an implemented information system (in this case, education, as an example).Historically and evolutionarily, the Japanese interpretation of the “Deming wheel” in Deming’s lectures of 1950 and 1951, led to the Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) cyclic quality. This paper presents particularly important and significant aspects of knowledge and experience acquired by the standardised application of SE on the time dimension “t”: PtDtCtAt or (PDCA)t quality improvement spiral.The first results presented in this work, refer to top-down (ICS-2=35.080) and the bottom-up (ICS-2=35.060) analysis of collective and local knowledge and knowledge acquisition in the IT and SE sub/fields. The results are primarily based on ISO/IEC standardisation, as well as on SRPS standards for the implementation, promotion and integration of IS, and they were researched and analysed in parallel.Classification of the sub-areas of SE applications within IT and related knowledge have exceptional importance, not only for learning and knowledge management, but also for the creation of IS and ES for business decisions. According to the ICS, IT is classified in field 35, with 12 segments. The focus in this work is on the development and SE applications, according to the “collective” (international or global) ISO/IEC [3] in parallel with local SRPS standards, [4] of the ICS-2=35.060 and ICS-2=35.080 sub-areas:35.080 — software, Including software development, documentation, Internet applications and use,35.060 — languages used in information technology etc.SE (including software development, system documentation and program languages in IT) is important in modelling IS excellence in several dimensions of the software, i.e. strategic, dynamic, temporal, institutional and resource size, as the final product is based on previous design (the product in the form of service).The possibility of reaching the level of collective knowledge is supposed in the starting hypothesis (by support from IT, SE and IS). The ultimate goals of this paper are the creation and continual improvement of knowledge based on standardised units of the knowledge base in SE, in order to model IS excellence. The goals are presented using important evolutionary trends in SE applications from the key results of IS improvement and with given answers to relevant questions, along with the hypothesis (assumption) that there is constant knowledge and IS acquisition in the PiDiCiAi (explanation i=ICS&ISO±SRPS/t, with time dimension “t”, where “t” represents year, month, week or day).Hypothesis 1Plan(i)-phaseH1–P(i) or P(IT/t) In planning the acquisition of knowledge in IT we need significant resources. The resources plan affecting comparative criteria starts from the goals and standardised knowledge, i.e. collective, national, individual or for professional work, to the evolution of the IT profession and then to IS excellence in the improvement of the quality of SE services and solving some practical problems with developed IS. Then, further, with answers to the questions such as, who will (or can they) and how will they plan the resources on the roads of knowledge acquisition in the areas of IT/SE (standardised collective — ISO, as a part of the “social” or civilisation domain for some planned results in the local SRPS) in time dimension “t”.H2–D(i) or D(SE/t) Paths of knowledge acquisition in SE fields are based on global (ISO) and local (SRPS) KS:–through development activities (from learning, development of standards, knowledge acquisition — in the field of SE and IS development),to IS modelling excellence using the standardised KB in the time (PtDtCtAt),andthe size of quantity indices (collective/ISO — local/SRPS) of publications (Iqp/i), new projects under development (Iqu/i), innovations (Iqi/i), for professional work, for improving the quality of IS.H3–C(i) or C(KB/t) Determining the intensity of KS innovation provides new benefits:–the possibilities of innovation intensity checking of the KB in the time dimension — analysis of the results (realised global activities in the Do(i)-phase, with innovation of standardised units of the KB and concrete actions on the continuous improvement of IS and ES), building on the determinants of the critical aspects of knowledge andthe possibility of anticipating the clusters and necessary resources for updating the KB according to the trends of innovations in the subfields or segments of SE according to the obtained results (quantity indices of innovations — Iqi/i, Iqu/i, price indices, innovation value indices — Ivi/i or Ivu/i) in the PiDiCiAi methodology.H4–A(i) or A(IS±ES/t) The possibility of improving the model IS±ES&PiDiCiAi&QMk exists producting IS excellence, quality and the results of IS applications, starting from the KS, an innovated data base, to a new KB (from standardised IT to operational improvement of the integrated IS and ES used in decision making at the university) towards knowledge quality management (QMk). Index “k” refers to the QM key criteria for knowledge acquisition (where k=1 to 12).The aim and purpose of this work is to be of use to higher education institutions, students, faculties, management, and teachers. In addition, since user participation in the standardisation process is becoming more important [6]; the article may be useful to participants who want to develop new standards (innovations) and new degree programmes in SE applications for IS and ES excellence.The significance of this study lies in determining the period necessary for updating the knowledge base in PDCA (for SE), as well as explicitly defining the criteria which show the limiting possibilities of knowledge innovation, that require appropriate solutions — implicitly. In short, the significance of the research and the study is presented in the “highlights”.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We can draw conclusions in several directions, for example, pragmatically, futuristically or theoretically (the mathematical relationships), or according to originality: KS, KB, KBS, the KB innovation trends in the PiDiCiAi methodology and the ICS&PDCA&QMk model; or on the routes: the pre-planned objectives of the work, the activities that accompany the work, the results and potential improvements. Open models approach the real situation with the possibility of innovation and knowledge acquisition, integrated improvement and the pursuit of IS integrated excellence. The answers to relevant issues (through the presentation of evidence of preliminary Hypotheses H1 to H4 through the PiDiCiAi), can be found in the correlation between different time stages, based on the presented results and the outlined analyses of the examples of SE and IS.According to the trends in collective ISO/IEC knowledge acquisition, the original mathematical relationships (presented trend lines, theoretically speaking), and individual knowledge of the stages of development of new projects on the practical side, that have already been formed, can be predicted for future resources, the financial needs of each of the segments/sub-areas and the whole resources. The difference between the discontinuous and continuous improvement of the quality and level of individual knowledge is important (valued ratio of 1 to 17.5). For this area of SE in IT, the needs are Iv/35.080/ISO/2013+Iv/35.060/ISO/2013=2760 CHF a year to maintain continuity of knowledge. Cumulatively, without continuous or discontinuous innovation, we need 17.5 times more money (ΣIv/35.080/ISO/2014.01+ΣIv/35.060/ISO/2014.01=48184 CHF) for all the ISO methods of knowledge acquisition on SE in IT.At the same time, parallel roads of knowledge acquisition on the standardisation platform in IT and isolated areas in SE were analysed (ISO/IEC and SRPS). It is also concluded that continuous innovation and knowledge of individual development projects (ISO) are financially justified.Based on these results (Sections 4 and 4.1 to 4.4), implicit conclusions can be drawn for IT resource planning (see Section 5.1).More precise determination of the quantitative (Iq) and financial (Iv) “gap” between the individual and collective – global (ISO) and local (or national SRPS) – through social knowledge of SE was enabled with the presented results of the original analyses (for two of the 12 areas of IT). On the other hand, the development trend of ISO standards is continuously supported by various technical committees (see Section 5.2). The results of the analyses and practices show that the standards of knowledge can be used for the formation of a local/national knowledge base which is more accessible than the present one. Therefore, the results of individual work would have been supported from “social”, public or civilisation and strategy-orientated results and also from the scope of knowledge acquisition, which is obviously the way to improve the quality, the education and the higher level of social (collective) knowledge. The acquisition of local knowledge in the area of software and system design (ICS-2=35.080) is more dominant than the segment of program languages in IT (ICS-2=35.060).The original mathematical relations (1)–(8) were derived and the trend lines have been presented, according to the trends and dynamic developments. These provide an important theoretical aspect of the solution of practical “problems”. It is undisputed that the “Paths of knowledge acquisition in SE fields are based on ISO/IEC standards” — Hypothesis 2 has been proven. The growing problem is how to access standards in certain areas of IT, according to the future directions in SE. In the present work, it is easier to solve SE problems at a state rather than at an individual level (no matter if it is work with professionals, teachers, designers or programmers etc.).Some, significant difficulties were shown by the results of the analyses (for ICS-1=35, ICS-2=35.080 and ICS-2=25.060, see Section 5.4), and also the future directions for limiting the summary criterion of value ΣIv/35/ISO/2014.01=378340 CHF.The solution to the problem is hidden in the access of updated standards for the advancement of knowledge and the new ISO–SRPS documents under development.In recent years, although the field of IT (for ICS-1=35) has been extensively imbued with SRPS standards (because of Serbia’s preparations for EU accession), this study shows that the same trend of innovation will not be continued in the future.The results of the original SE analyses were correlated with IT, enabling closer determination of the financial “gap” between individual and collective, national (SRPS) and global (ISO) knowledge acquisition, opening up new possibilities for further research, and innovation of KB of the SE, towards IS excellence.The creation of an original methodology for checking the KB innovation trend in the time dimension and comparison of the intensity of innovation in all technologies on the standardisation platform were allowed by the results of these analyses (see Section 5.3).It is necessary to continuously improve standardised knowledge. Improvements in IS (in companies) often depend on management, leadership, and all the capacities of the macro processes designed to achieve better results. This research work (developmental, pragmatic, futuristic) will be followed by a more detailed analysis of IS modelling (IS±ES&PDCA&QMk towards excellence) for decision making in an integrated universities’ IS. Future directions (the product is software), the application of the SE part of the work, deals with modelling excellence and analysing the developed IS for student services, according to aspects of the customised models of excellence as well as continuous improvement of IS in the temporal dimension of the PDCA spiral. The upcoming new degree programmes can be used for other future directions (when products are the services of higher education), see Section 5.4.
