@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The pressure waves propagating through an incompressible inviscid fluid that moves in a circular cylindrical long elastic tube are considered. The reductive perturbation method is used to derive the KdV equation from the hydrodynamic equations of the system. The Euler–Lagrange variational technique described by Agrawal has been applied to formulate the time-fractional KdV equation. The derived time-fractional KdV equation is solved by employing the variational-iteration method represented by He. The effects of the tube and fluid parameters and the time fractional order on the propagation of pressure waves are investigated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The propagation of pressure waves in fluid that moves in large vessels was studied by many authors, e.g. References 1–16. Many of the works studied the small amplitude wave propagation in elastic tubes, ignored the nonlinear effects and focused on the dispersive characteristic [3–5]. When the nonlinear character appears, either finite amplitude or small-but-finite amplitude wave is considered, depending on the nonlinearity order. The propagation of finite waves through fluid filled elastic or viscoelastic tubes was studied [6–9]. Also, the small-but-finite amplitude waves propagating in distensible tubes were investigated [10–16], where the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation appears due to the balancing between the nonlinearity and the dispersion effects.The KdV equation as evolution and interaction model of nonlinear waves is employed to represent a wide range of physical phenomena. The KdV equation was first formulated as an evolution equation governing one-dimensional, small amplitude, long surface gravity waves propagating in a shallow water channel [17]. Afterward, the KdV equation has appeared in a number of other physical problems such as ion-acoustic waves, collision-free hydro-magnetic waves, plasma physics, stratified internal waves, lattice dynamics, etc. [18]. By means of the KdV model, some theoretical physics phenomena in quantum mechanics domain and continuum mechanics for shock wave formation are explained. The KdV model is also applied in many scientific fields like fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, solitons, turbulence, boundary layer behavior and mass transport.Most of the forces in nature are non-conservative: dissipative and/or dispersive forces. The classical mechanics treated conservative forces using integer differential equations, while the non-conservative forces can be described in terms of the non-integer differential equations. Non-integer differentiation and integration is called Fractional Calculus, which is a field of mathematics study that generalizes the traditional definitions of calculus integral and derivative operators. During the last decades, Fractional Calculus has acquired importance due to its applications in various fields of science and engineering, including electrical networks, signal processing, optics, fluid flow, viscoelasticity, rheology, probability and statistics, dynamical process in self-similar and porous structures, diffusive transport, control theory of dynamical systems, electrochemistry of corrosion, and so on [19–35].Riewe [19,20] used fractional derivatives [21–23] in the action to have non-conservative Euler–Lagrange equations. In terms of Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives, Agrawal [24–26] used variational technique to formulate fractional equations of motion. These Euler–Lagrange equations are employed to investigate different real problems [27–35].The fractional differential equations are solved by applying several methods such as: Fourier transformation method, Laplace transformation method, operational method, and the iteration method [21–23]. However, most of these methods are suitable only for special types of fractional differential equations, called linear with constant coefficients. Recently, there are some works dealing with the solutions of nonlinear fractional differential equations using techniques of nonlinear analysis such as: Adomian decomposition method (ADM) [36–42], variational-iteration method (VIM) [43–48], homotopy perturbation method (HPM) [49,50] and others. Adomian decomposition method [36–38] succeeded to solve accurately different types of fractional nonlinear differential equations by applying the Adomian polynomials. This method is applied to study many problems arising from applied sciences and engineering [39–42]. The variational-iteration method [43–46] was successfully employed to solve many types of linear, nonlinear and fractional differential equations that describe scientific and engineering problems [46–48]. As advantages over ADM, the VIM solves differential equations without using Adomian polynomials and has no linearization or perturbation for solving the nonlinear and fractional problems. The VIM principles for solving the differential equations are given in many papers, e.g. References 46–48. The VIM solution is provided as a convergent series, which may lead to exact solution for linear differential equations and to an efficient numerical solution for nonlinear and fractional differential equations. The series solution begins with a trial function that can be used as the solution of the linear term of the differential equation.Our main motive here is to study the time fractional parameter effects on the propagation of solitary pressure waves through a fluid filled elastic tube. Therefore, beside what is considered in Reference 16, the derived nonlinear KdV equation is transformed using variational technique described by Agrawal [24–26] into the time fractional KdV (TFKdV) equation [45]. The TFKdV equation is solved by applying VIM [46–48] developed by He and the effect of the fractional order is studied.This paper is organized as follows: The basic set of tube and fluid equations, which governs our system, is presented in section 2. In section 3, the KdV equation is derived by applying the reductive perturbation method [51]. Section 4 is devoted to derive and solve the time fractional KdV (TFKdV) equation using variational methods. Finally, some results and discussion are presented in section 5.A circular cylindrical long tube of un-deformed radiusR0, subjected to a uniform initial inner pressureP0is considered. A position vectorr¯of a general point on the tube is described as [11,12]:(1a)r¯=[r0+u(z,t)]e^¯r+ze^¯z(1b)z=λzZwherer0is the radius of the tube after a finite static deformation,u(z,t)is a finite dynamic time dependent deformation in the tube radius,e^¯rande^¯zare the radial and axial unit vectors, respectively in the cylindrical polar coordinates.Zis the axial coordinate before the deformation,zis the axial coordinate after the static deformation andλzis the axial stretch ratio. The equation of motion of a small element of the tube's wall in the radial direction is given by [11,12](2)R0ρ0λz∂2u(z,t)∂t2=∂∂z[R0μΛ∂∑(z,t)∂λ1∂u(z,t)∂z]−μλz∂∑(z,t)∂λ2+R0λ2HP*(z,t)whereρ0andμare the mass density and the shear modulus of the tube material, respectively.∑(z,t)is the strain energy density function,P*(z,t)is the fluid pressure at the final inner deformed tube radiusrfandHis the initial un-deformed tube thickness.randzare the radial and axial cylindrical coordinates, respectively after both static and dynamic deformations andtis the time parameter.λ1andλ2are the axial and radial direction stretches, respectively and are represented by [11,12](3a)λ1=λzΛ(3b)λ2=λr+u(z,t)/R0(3c)Λ={1+[∂u(z,t)/∂z]2}1/2whereλr=r0/R0is the radial stretch ratio after finite static deformation.Equation (2) has been derived by applying Newton's second law of motion for a small element of the tube wall material [11,12]. The term in the left hand side is Newton's second law force of the wall element. In the right hand side, the first term is the force due to axial tension of the tube wall, the second term is the force due to the tension in the radial direction and the third term is the force due to the inner fluid pressure on the tube wall element.The value of the fluid pressure at the final radius of the deformed tube (rf) can be obtained from (2) as(4)P*(z,t)=ρ0Hλ1λ2∂2u(z,t)∂t2+μHλ1λ2R0∂∑(z,t)∂λ2−μHλzλ1λ2∂∂z[1Λ∂∑(z,t)∂λ1∂u(z,t)∂z]On the other hand, the fluid that filled the tube is considered to be an incompressible inviscid fluid. The ratio of the viscous term to the nonlinear term is assumed to be very small. Therefore, the viscous effect in comparison to the nonlinear effect will be neglected. Based on these assumptions, the incompressible inviscid fluid filled the tube has equations of axially symmetrical motion in the cylindrical polar coordinates represented by [12,13](5a)∂V(r,z,t)∂r+V(r,z,t)r+∂W(r,z,t)∂z=0(5b)∂V(r,z,t)∂t+V(r,z,t)∂V(r,z,t)∂r+W(r,z,t)∂V(r,z,t)∂z+1ρf∂P(r,z,t)∂r=0(5c)∂W(r,z,t)∂t+V(r,z,t)∂W(r,z,t)∂r+W(r,z,t)∂W(r,z,t)∂z+1ρf∂P(r,z,t)∂z=0The first equation (5a) is the incompressibility condition (mass conservation) of the fluid, while (5b) and (5c) are conservative equations of fluid momentum in radial and axial directions, respectively.These field equations (5) satisfy boundary conditions at the wall as follows:The pressure at the final deformed radius of the tube is given as(6a)P(rf​,z,t)=P*(z,t)while the fluid velocity at the wall is assumed to equal the radial velocity of the wall itself (no-slip condition) [13], so(6b)V(rf​,z,t)=dr¯dt⋅e^¯r|r=rf=∂u(z,t)∂t+∂u(z,t)∂zW(rf​,z,t)HereV(r,z,t)andW(r,z,t)are the radial and axial fluid velocity components, respectively,P(r,z,t)is the fluid pressure andρfis the fluid mass density.The strain energy density∑(z,t)is generally a function ofλ1andλ2. Expanding∑(z,t)into power series at its equilibrium, (4) can take the form [16](7)P*(z,t)=b1μHR02u+ρ0Hλrλz∂2u∂t2−a1μH∂2u∂z2+b2μHR03u2−ρ0Hλr2λzR0u∂2u∂t2−a2μHR0(∂u∂z)2+(a1μHλrR0−2a2μHR0)u∂2u∂z2+μHR0P0where the coefficientsa1,a2,b1andb2are defined by(8a)a1=1λrλz∂∑∂Λ|u=0​,a2=R0λrλz∂2∑∂Λ∂u|u=0(8b)b1=R0λrλz(R0∂2∑∂u2−1λr∂∑∂u)|u=0​,b2=R032λrλz∂3∑∂u3|u=0−b1λrEquations (5)–(7) give sufficient relations to determine the unknownsV(r,z,t),W(r,z,t),u(r,z,t), andP(r,z,t).The following stretched co-ordinates can be introduced by applying the reductive perturbation theory [51] as:(10)ξ=ε1/2(z−gt),τ=ε3/2twhereεis a smallness parameter andgis the long wave approximation's phase velocity.

[45] to have the form [see Appendix A]:(18)​0RDταY(ξ,τ)+AY(ξ,τ)∂∂ξY(ξ,τ)+B∂3∂ξ3Y(ξ,τ)=0,0<α≤1,τ∈[0,T0]where the Riesz fractional operator​0RDταU(ξ,τ)is represented by [21–23](19)​0RDταf(ξ,τ)=121Γ(1−α)ddτ[∫0τdt(τ−t)−αf(ξ,t)−∫τT0dt(t−τ)−αf(ξ,t)]=121Γ(1−α)ddτ∫0T0dt|τ−t|−αf(ξ,t)The TFKdV equation represented by (18) can be solved using the VIM [43–46] in terms of the following correction functional [see Appendix B](20)Yn+1(ξ,τ)=Yn(ξ,τ)−∫0τdτ′{∂∂τ′Yn(ξ,τ′)−0R​Iτ′1−αYn(ξ,τ′)|τ′=0[τ′(α−2)/Γ(α−1)]+0RDτ′1−α[AYn(ξ,τ)∂∂ξYn(ξ,τ′)+B∂3∂ξ3Yn(ξ,τ′)]},n≥0where the Riesz integral operator​aRIταY(ξ,τ)is represented by [21–23](21)​aRIταf(ξ,τ)=121Γ(α)∫abdt|τ−t|α−1f(ξ,t)If the parameterτrepresents the time-variable in (18), the right Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative in Riesz fractional operator can be interpreted as future states of the system. Therefore, this term may be neglected in calculations, when the present state of the system does not depend on the results of the future development [23].The initial value of the state variable can be taken to represent the zero-order correction of the solution. This initial value is taken as the solution of the ordinary KdV equation at time equal to zero, in this case as:(22a)Y0(ξ,τ)=Y(ξ,0)=A0sech2(cξ)whereA0=3v/A,c=v/(4B).Substituting the zero-order solution (22a) into (20) leads to the first order approximation as(22b)Y1(ξ,τ)=A0sech2(cξ)+2A0csinh(cξ)sech3(cξ)∗[4c2B+(A0A−12c2B)sech2(cξ)]τα/Γ(α+1)Substituting this equation into (20) and using the Mathematical package like Maple or Mathematica lead to the second order approximation in the form(22c)Y2(ξ,τ)=A0sech2(cξ)+2A0csinh(cξ)sech(cξ)3∗[4c2B+(A0A−12c2B)sech(cξ)2]ταΓ(α+1)+2A0c2sech(cξ)2[32c4B2+16c2B(5A0A−63c2B)sech(cξ)2+2(3A02A2−176A0c2AB+1680c4B2)sech(cξ)4−7(A02A2−42A0c2AB+360c4B2)sech(cξ)6]τ2αΓ(2α+1)+4A02c3sinh(cξ)sech(cξ)5[32c4B2+24c2B(A0A−14c2B)sech(cξ)2+4(A02A2−32A0c2AB+240c4B2)sech(cξ)4−5(A02A2−24A0c2AB+144c4B2)sech(cξ)6]Γ(2α+1)[Γ(α+1)]2τ3αΓ(3α+1)The higher order approximations can be calculated using a symbolic mathematical package to the appropriate order where the infinite approximation leads to exact solution.
