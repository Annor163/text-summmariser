Tree testing of hierarchical menu structures for health applications

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We conducted online tree tests to evaluate navigation structure in a health interface.In tree testing, participants navigate through a menu abstraction of the interface.Participants are asked to navigate while completing representative tasks.Performance metrics include completion time, task accuracy, and path length.Comparison with in person usability testing identified similar performance.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To address the need for greater evidence-based evaluation of Health Information Technology (HIT) systems we introduce a method of usability testing termed tree testing. In a tree test, participants are presented with an abstract hierarchical tree of the system taxonomy and asked to navigate through the tree in completing representative tasks. We apply tree testing to a commercially available health application, demonstrating a use case and providing a comparison with more traditional in-person usability testing methods. Online tree tests (N=54) and in-person usability tests (N=15) were conducted from August to September 2013. Tree testing provided a method to quantitatively evaluate the information structure of a system using various navigational metrics including completion time, task accuracy, and path length. The results of the analyses compared favorably to the results seen from the traditional usability test. Tree testing provides a flexible, evidence-based approach for researchers to evaluate the information structure of HITs. In addition, remote tree testing provides a quick, flexible, and high volume method of acquiring feedback in a structured format that allows for quantitative comparisons. With the diverse nature and often large quantities of health information available, addressing issues of terminology and concept classifications during the early development process of a health information system will improve navigation through the system and save future resources. Tree testing is a usability method that can be used to quickly and easily assess information hierarchy of health information systems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Health Information Technologies (HIT) are highly complex systems, with interfaces that incorporate multiple menu labels navigating across both broad and deep structures. The user interface (UI) also contributes towards challenges in navigation with dense displays, cluttered layout, icons, and popups. We demonstrate the use of tree testing as a method to evaluate an abstraction of navigation structure, in particular, focusing on only the menu labels and their organization within the navigational hierarchy. In a tree test, users navigate the disembodied representation of the UI, consisting of only menu labels and their sublevels while trying to complete representative tasks. This approach isolates the conceptual component of the navigation structure from the UI, though it is recognized that elements of the UI also contributes towards navigation within the HIT system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Systems with poor usability have been found to negatively impact patient mortality [25,26]. In contrast, well-designed user tested systems can have a positive impact on patient safety [27]. The need for testing of HIT systems is well-recognized within the literature, while its financial benefits have also been established in terms of identifying and fixing usability problems prior to widespread release [28]. We introduce tree testing as a usability method to assess information hierarchy of health information systems. This can be applied early during the development process to evaluate an existing taxonomy or to compare amongst potential variants of taxonomies. Tree testing is not the sole approach towards evaluation of HIT systems and instead a continuum of testing methods should be applied from laboratory to in situ settings [29]. However tree testing does provide a flexible, evidence-based approach for researchers to evaluate the information structure of HITs.
