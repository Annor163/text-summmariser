Effects of ECG sampling rate on QT interval variability measurement

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval on surface ECG is a marker of repolarization lability.As QT variability is typically very small, ECG acquisition parameters are important.QT variability can be reliability measured when the sampling rate is 500Hz or above.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) has been used as a marker of repolarization lability and sympathetic activation. The aim of this study was to establish ECG sampling rate requirements for reliable QT interval variability measurement.We measured QTV in high resolution simulated (1000Hz) and real ECG (1600Hz; in the supine position during rest and during sympathetic activation upon standing), using time and frequency domain metrics as well as measures of symbolic dynamics for complexity assessment. We successively halved the sampling rate and investigated its effect on the QTV metrics.Reduction in sampling rate below 400Hz and 500Hz, respectively, resulted in a significant overestimation of QTV variability and also affected complexity measurement of QTV. QTV increased during standing compared to the supine measurement. At 100Hz, the posture related change in QTV was completely masked by the measurement noise introduced by the low sampling rate.In conclusion, ECG sampling rates of 500Hz yields a reliable QTV measurement, while sampling rates of 200Hz and below should be avoided.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The QT interval of ECG is a measure of ventricular depolarization and repolarization duration. Corrected for heart rate, it is clinically used to diagnose congenital or acquired QT syndromes [1,2]. The QT interval fluctuates from beat to beat and quantification of this so-called QT interval variability (QTV) has received increasing interest as evidence of the association between increased QTV and elevated risk of cardiac and overall mortality is mounting [3–5]. Aside from its potential use for cardiac risk stratification QTV may be used as a noninvasive marker of sympathetic outflow to the heart, because studies in humans have repeatedly demonstrated increased QTV during periods of acute cardiac sympathetic activation, elicited by pharmacological beta receptor activation or by orthostatic challenge, in particular in healthy subjects [6–8] or subjects with structurally normal hearts [9,10]. The level of QTV measured during rest was shown to be directly correlated with cardiac noradrenaline spillover in hypertensive subjects [11], but not in normal subjects or patients with major depressive disorder or panic disorder [12]. A canine model of tachycardia induced heart failure showed a direct correlation between the QTV and integrated left stellate-ganglion nervous activity [13].Although QTV has been widely studied in various clinical research settings, some basic technical considerations regarding the QT measurement have been insufficiently addressed. Technical aspects are of particular significance since beat-to-beat fluctuations in the QT interval are typically small, with a standard deviation of less than 5ms when measured at stable heart rates during rest [14]. Addressing the issue of high precision QT interval delineation of body surface ECG, we have previously shown that template matching algorithms specifically dedicated to the analysis of QTV are better suited to measure subtle beat-to-beat changes in QT interval than conventional delineation techniques [15]. At a more fundamental level, however, ECG data acquisition requirements for measuring meaningful QTV have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Previous studies performing QTV analysis used ECG that was sampled at rates as low as 128Hz [16]. The aim of this study was to systematically explore the effects of sampling rate on QTV metrics, using simulated ECG with predefined QTV as well as real ECG recordings from healthy subjects to offer guidance for ECG recording requirements. Experimental conditions characterized by a low and high sympathetic drive were considered (i.e. resting in the supine position and standing, respectively).
