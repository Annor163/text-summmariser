Epilepsy is a common serious neurological disorder with a complex set of possible phenotypes ranging from pathologic abnormalities to variations in electroencephalogram. This paper presents a system called Phenotype Exaction in Epilepsy (PEEP) for extracting complex epilepsy phenotypes and their correlated anatomical locations from clinical discharge summaries, a primary data source for this purpose. PEEP generates candidate phenotype and anatomical location pairs by embedding a named entity recognition method, based on the Epilepsy and Seizure Ontology, into the National Library of Medicine’s MetaMap program. Such candidate pairs are further processed using a correlation algorithm. The derived phenotypes and correlated locations have been used for cohort identification with an integrated ontology-driven visual query interface. To evaluate the performance of PEEP, 400 de-identified discharge summaries were used for development and an additional 262 were used as test data. PEEP achieved a micro-averaged precision of 0.924, recall of 0.931, andF1-measure of 0.927 for extracting epilepsy phenotypes. The performance on the extraction of correlated phenotypes and anatomical locations shows a micro-averagedF1-measure of 0.856 (Precision: 0.852, Recall: 0.859). The evaluation demonstrates that PEEP is an effective approach to extracting complex epilepsy phenotypes for cohort identification.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There is an extensive amount of existing work in creating clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems to extract information from free text in specific disease domains. Two salient examples are the Cancer Text Information System (caTIES) [1] and SymText [2]. caTIES has been developed at the University of Pittsburgh to extract coded information from surgical pathology reports using terms from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus. SymText has been used to detect acute bacterial pneumonia from chest X-ray reports. However, few existing efforts have specifically targeted the epilepsy domain.Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by a disruption of the normal electrochemical activity of the brain that results in recurrent seizures [3]. It is the most common neurological disorder, affecting 50–60million people globally [4]. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading mode of epilepsy-related death and is most common in patients with intractable, frequent, and continuing seizures [5]. It is responsible for 8–17% of deaths in epilepsy patients [6]. The selection of patient cohorts for SUDEP research relies on specific phenotypic characteristics, including syndrome, seizure types, EEG abnormalities, response to anticonvulsants, age at onset, presence of a family history of epilepsy, and medical comorbid disorders [7]. In addition to these phenotypes, the correlation of phenotypic information with anatomical information is crucial for gaining a better understanding of SUDEP, since anatomical information is important for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis [8].A typical SUDEP cohort identification query uses several phenotypic and anatomical characteristics. A sample query may read like this: “Identify patients with left frontal lobe epilepsy who have right versive seizure and whose EEG shows left frontal spikes and left frontal ictal EEG pattern”. This query illustrates the required correlation between phenotypic elements (e.g., “versive seizure”, “spikes”, “ictal EEG pattern”) and anatomical locations including laterality (e.g., “right”, “left frontal lobe”, “left frontal”).Epilepsy phenotypes and related anatomical locations are primarily recorded in narrative discharge summaries in Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs). Manual review of a large number of discharge summaries to extract such information is costly and time-consuming. This problem is exacerbated in multi-center clinical studies such as the ongoing US National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIH-NINDS) initiative on SUDEP [9].PRISM (Prevention and Risk Identification of SUDEP Mortality) is a multi-center study funded as a part of the NINDS SUDEP initiative. PRISM aims to enroll potential SUDEP patients from four participating EMUs [10]. Processing clinical narratives from the participating EMUs is a significant informatics challenge for the following reasons:1.Epilepsy discharge summaries contain highly specialized epilepsy and seizure-specific terms;Background knowledge needs to be used to take full advantage of the detailed placement information associated with electrodes that are used to record EEG patterns; andThere are positional variations of anatomical locations of epilepsy phenotypes described in discharge summaries.
