@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ranking fuzzy numbers is a very important decision-making procedure in decision analysis and applications. The last few decades have seen a large number of approaches investigated for ranking fuzzy numbers, yet some of these approaches are non-intuitive and inconsistent. In 1992, Liou and Wang proposed an approach to rank fuzzy number based a convex combination of the right and the left integral values through an index of optimism. Despite its merits, some shortcomings associated with Liou and Wang's approach include: (i) it cannot differentiate normal and non-normal fuzzy numbers, (ii) it cannot rank effectively the fuzzy numbers that have a compensation of areas, (iii) when the left or right integral values of the fuzzy numbers are zero, the index of optimism has no effect in either the left integral value or the right integral value of the fuzzy number, and (iv) it cannot rank consistently the fuzzy numbers and their images.This paper proposes a revised ranking approach to overcome the shortcomings of Liou and Wang's ranking approach. The proposed ranking approach presents the novel left, right, and total integral values of the fuzzy numbers. The median value ranking approach is further applied to differentiate fuzzy numbers that have the compensation of areas. Finally, several comparative examples and an application for market segment evaluation are given herein to demonstrate the usages and advantages of the proposed ranking method for fuzzy numbers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Ranking fuzzy numbers plays a very important role in decision-making, optimization, and other usages. Over the last few decades numerous ranking approaches have been proposed and investigated [1–14], with the first method for ranking fuzzy numbers proposed by Jain [1]. Chen [2] offered an approach for ranking fuzzy numbers by using maximizing set and minimizing set concepts. Liou and Wang [3] developed a ranking approach based on an integral value index to overcome the shortcomings of Chen's [2] approach. Cheng [4] presented an approach for ranking fuzzy numbers by using the distance method. Chu and Tsao [5] proposed an approach for ranking fuzzy numbers with the area between the centroid point and original point. Abbasbandy and Asady [6] introduced an approach to rank fuzzy numbers by sign distance. Chen and Tang [7] presented an approach to rank non-normal p-norm trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with integral value. Abbasbandy and Hajjari [8] showed a new approach for ranking of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Wang and Luo [9] proposed an area ranking of fuzzy numbers based on positive and negative ideal points. Kumar et al. [10] offered an approach for ranking generalized exponential fuzzy numbers using an integral value approach. Kumar et al. [11] modified Liou and Wang's [3] approach for the ranking of an L–R type generalized fuzzy number. Chou et al. [12] presented a revised maximizing set and minimizing set ranking approach.Among the ranking approaches, Liou and Wang's [3] method is a commonly used approach that is highly cited and has wide applications [7,10,11,15–20], but there are some shortcomings associated with their ranking approach. For the triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Liou and Wang [3] showed that the integral values of normal and non-normal fuzzy numbers are equal. In other words, the fuzzy numbersA1=(a,b,c,d;w1)andA2=(a,b,c,d;w2)with (ω1≠ω2), are considered the same. Cheng [4] indicated that Liou and Wang's [3] approach could not differentiate normal and non-normal triangular/trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, because of equivalence between these fuzzy numbers. In addition, Garcia and Lamata [16] showed that if the fuzzy numbers to be compared have the compensation of areas, then they cannot be ranked by the Liou and Wang's [3] approach. Furthermore, when the left or right integral values of fuzzy numbers are zero, the index of optimism has no effect in either the left integral value or the right integral value of the fuzzy number. Finally, Liou and Wang's [3] approach may result in inconsistency between the ranking of the fuzzy numbers and the ranking of their images.To overcome all the aforementioned shortcomings with Liou and Wang's [3] ranking approach, this paper proposes a revised approach for ranking fuzzy numbers, presenting the novel left, right, and total integral values of fuzzy numbers. In order for the proposed method to have flexibility, the decision maker's optimistic attitude of fuzzy numbers is taken into account. The median value ranking approach is further applied to differentiate fuzzy numbers that have the compensation of areas. Finally, several comparative examples and an application for market segment evaluation are given to demonstrate the usages and advantages of the proposed ranking approach for fuzzy numbers. The results show that the proposed ranking approach can effectively overcome the shortcomings of Liou and Wang's approach.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 states the preliminary concepts and definitions of fuzzy numbers. Section 3 briefly reviews Liou and Wang's ranking approach. Section 4 uses four numerical examples to show the shortcomings of Liou and Wang’ ranking approach. Section 5 proposes the revised ranking approach. Section 6 illustrates the proposed ranking method through five numerical examples. Section 7 applies the proposed ranking method for ranking fuzzy numbers to a market segment evaluation and selection problem, demonstrating its applicability and efficiency. Finally, Section 8 draws the conclusions.This section briefly reviews the definitions of fuzzy numbers as follows.A fuzzy number is a fuzzy subset in support R (real number) that is both “normal” and “convex”, wheresupp(A)={x∈RμA>0}. Normality implies that the maximum value of the fuzzy set A in R is 1. Therefore, the non-normal fuzzy number is ∀x∈R, Maxx{μA(x)}<1 [4].For convenience, the fuzzy number can be denoted by [a, b, c, d;ϖ], and the membership function of fuzzy number A=[a, b, c, d;ϖ] can be expressed as:(1)fA(x)=fAL(x),a≤x≤b,ϖ,b≤x≤c,fAR(x),c≤x≤d,0,otherwise,wherefAL:[a,b]→[0,ϖ]andfAR:[c,d]→[0,ϖ]. SincefAL(x)andfAR(x)are both strictly monotonical and continuous functions, their inverse functions exist and should be continuous and strictly monotonical. The inverse functions offAL(x)andfAR(x)can be denoted bygAL:[0,ω]→[a,b]andgAR:[0,ω]→[c,d], respectively. As such,gAL(y)andgAR(y)are then integrable on the closed interval [0, ω]. In other words, both∫0ωgAL(y)and∫0ωgAR(y)exist. The image (or opposite) of a fuzzy number A=(a, b, c, d;ϖ) can be given by fuzzy number −A=(−d, −c, −b, −a;ω) as it is given in [21].Combining the left and right integral values, Liou and Wang [3] proposed an approach for ranking fuzzy numbers with an index of optimism α∈[0, 1]. The left and right integral values of fuzzy number A are defined asIL(A)=∫01gAL(y)dyandIR(A)=∫01gAR(y)dy, which reflect the pessimistic and optimistic viewpoints of the decision maker, respectively. The total integral value with an index of optimism α∈[0, 1] is defined as:(2)ITα(A)=αIR(A)+(1−α)IL(A)=α∫01gAR(y)dy+(1−α)∫01gAL(y)dywheregAL(y)andgAR(y)are respectively the inverse functions offAL(x)andfAR(x). The index of optimism α represents the degree of optimism of a decision maker. A larger α indicates a higher degree of optimism. For α=0 and α=1, the values ofITα(A)represent the viewpoints of pessimistic and optimistic decision makers, respectively. For a moderate decision maker, with α=0.5, the total integral value of each fuzzy number A becomes:IT0.5(A)=12IR(A)+IL(A)The greater isITα(A), the bigger the fuzzy number Aiis and the higher its ranking order.This section points out the shortcomings of Liou and Wang's [3] approach. Several examples are chosen to prove that the ranking approach, proposed by Liou and Wang, does not satisfy the reasonable properties for the ordering of fuzzy numbers.First, Liou and Wang's method [3] cannot differentiate normal and non-normal triangular/trapezoidal fuzzy numbers [4]. For the non-normal fuzzy numbers, Liou and Wang [3] made the following assumption: “When B is a non-normal fuzzy number, fBcan always be normalized by dividing the maximal value of fBbefore ranking”. Specifically, let the normalized fuzzy number of B and the corresponding membership function respectively beB¯andf¯B(x)=fB(x)/ω, where ω=maxxfB(x). The integral value of B is then represented by the integral value ofB¯when being ranked. Hence,IL(B)=IL(B¯)andIR(B)=IR(B¯). For the case of trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers, Liou and Wang proved that the total integral values of normal and non-normal fuzzy numbers are the same [7].Example 1Consider the triangular fuzzy numbers A1=(3, 5, 7;1) and A2=(3, 5, 7;0.8) as in Fig. 1, from [3]. Intuitively, the ranking order is A1≻A2. However, through Liou and Wang's method, the total integral values of the triangular fuzzy numbers A1 and A2 are respectivelyITα(A1)=4+2αandITα(A2)=4+2α. Thus, the ranking order of fuzzy numbers A1 and A2 is the same, i.e., A1∼A2. for every α∈[0, 1]. Liou and Wang's approach therefore fails to correctly rank the given fuzzy numbers.In addition, it is also found that when the fuzzy numbers to be compared have the compensation of areas, i.e. the fuzzy numbersA1=(a1,b1,c1,d1;w)andA2=(a2,b2,c2,d2;w)with IL(A)=IL(B) and IR(A)=IR(B), they cannot differentiate using Liou and Wang's approach [16].Example 2Consider the normal triangular fuzzy numbers A1=(1,4,5) and A3=(2,3,6) as in Fig. 2which is taken from [16]. It is easy to verify that A1 and A2 have the compensation of areas and therefore cannot be distinguished by Liou and Wang's [3] approach.Liou and Wang’ [3] approach also used an index of optimism to reflect the decision maker's optimistic attitude. However, when the left or right integral values of fuzzy numbers are zero, the index of optimism has no effect in either the left integral value or the right integral value of the fuzzy number. When considering the fuzzy number A=(a, b, c, d;ω), either a=b or a+b=0 or c=d or c+d=0 the left and right integral values of fuzzy number A will be IL(A)=0 or IR(A)=0, respectively.Example 3Consider the triangular fuzzy numbers, A=(−1,1,2), and B=(−3,−2,2) as in Fig. 3. Using Liou and Wang's [3] approach, either the left integral value of fuzzy number A or the right integral value of fuzzy number B are 0, i.e. either IL(A)=0 or IR(B)=0, for all α∈[0, 1]. Thus, the decision maker's viewpoint or the index of optimism has no effect in either the left integral value of fuzzy number A or the right integral value of fuzzy number B. This is not reasonable.The following example shows that Liou and Wang's [3] approach cannot consistently rank the fuzzy numbers and its images.Example 4Fig. 4presents three normal triangular fuzzy numbers, A=(1, 3, 5), B=(2, 3, 4), and C=(1, 4, 6). Using Liou and Wang's [3] approach, the total integral values of fuzzy numbers A, B, and C areITα(A)=2+2α,ITα(B)=2.5+α, andITα(C)=2.5+2.5α, respectively. Thus, the ranking orders of fuzzy numbers A, B, and C are A≺B=C for α=0, B≺A≺C for α=1, and A=B≺C for α=1/2. From this, one can logically infer the ranking order of the images of these fuzzy numbers as −A≻−B=−C for α=0. −B≻−A≻−C for α=1, and −A=−B≻−C for α=1/2. However, using Liou and Wang's approach, the total integral values of fuzzy numbers −A, −B, and −C areITα(−A)=−4+2α,ITα(−B)=−3.5+α, andITα(C)=−5+2.5α, respectively. The results show that −B≻−A≻−C for α=0, −A≻−B=−C for α=1, and −A=−B≻−C for α=1/2. Obviously, Liou and Wang's [3] approach inconsistently ranks fuzzy numbers and their images.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper has proposed a revised ranking approach to overcome the shortcomings of Liou and Wang's ranking approach. The proposed ranking approach presents the novel left, right, and total integral values of fuzzy numbers. To differentiate fuzzy numbers that have the compensation of areas, the median value ranking approach is further applied. Several comparative examples and an application for market segment evaluation have been given to illustrate the usage, applicability, and advantages of the proposed ranking approach. The results indicate that the ranking order obtained by the proposed approach is more consistent with human intuitions than Liou and Wang's original method. Furthermore, the revised ranking approach is easy to apply and can effectively rank a mix of various types of fuzzy numbers, including normal, non-normal, triangular, trapezoidal, and other types of fuzzy numbers.
