@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundThis paper describes use of Prony’s method as a filter applied to multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals. Prony’s method can be viewed as an extension of Fourier analysis that allows a signal to be decomposed into a linear combination of functions with different amplitudes, damping factors, frequencies and phase angles.MethodBy selecting Prony method parameters, a frequency filter has been developed which improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three different criteria were applied to data recorded from control subjects to produce three separate datasets: unfiltered raw data, data filtered using the traditional method (fast Fourier transform: FFT), and data filtered using Prony’s method.ResultsFiltering using Prony’s method improved the signals’ original SNR by 44.52%, while the FFT filter improved the SNR by 33.56%. The extent to which signal can be separated from noise was analysed using receiver–operating–characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was greater in the signals filtered using Prony’s method than in the original signals or in those filtered using the FFT.Conclusionfiltering using Prony’s method improves the quality of mfVEP signal pre-processing when compared with the original signals, or with those filtered using the FFT.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since development of the multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) recording technique [1], it has been possible to obtain signals that reflect electrical activity in the primary visual cortex in response to stimuli in various sectors of the visual field. Results obtained by analysing mfVEP signals show that it is a valid tool for assessment of visual function in patients with glaucoma [2], amblyopia [3], optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis [4,5] and other pathologies that affect the visual pathway.As is the case with other electrophysiological recordings, mfVEP signals are contaminated by noise. In contrast-reversing stimulus, mfVEP signals’ amplitude is in the order of nanovolts (although in the case of pattern-pulse stimulus [6] it can be in the order of microvolts), and may even be essentially zero in some locations in control subjects due to local folding of the cortex [7]. Sources of contamination may include the EEG’s alpha waves, other physiological signals emitted by the patient (muscle-tension-associated noise[2], ECG, EOG, etc.), or interference from the power grid or from other electronic equipment.Very few papers investigate the influence of mfVEP signal pre-processing techniques. In some cases, the signals only undergo the band-pass filtering set by the amplifiers: cut-off frequencies of 3–100Hz [5,8,9], 1–100Hz [10,11] and 1–20Hz [12,13]. In other papers after the hardware filter a digital filter based on fast Fourier transform is applied, with different cut-off frequencies depending of the work: 1–30Hz [14], 3–30Hz [15,16] and 3–35Hz [17,18].Filtering is essential when performing patient diagnosis based on the results of signal classification. Prony’s method [19] can be viewed as an extension of Fourier analysis that allows a signal to be decomposed into a linear combination of functions with different amplitudes, damping factors, frequencies and phase angles. Prony’s method has been widely applied to electrophysiological signals [20–24]. It is a natural transformation for impulse responses since it uses damped sinusoids as a basis and therefore representation is efficient in terms of the number of coefficients required. Another advantage is that Prony modelling produces higher frequency resolution than simple FFT methods due to its reliance on autoregressive modelling [25]. It is remarkable that the transient nature of evoked potentials is more suited to modelling as a sum of damped sinusoids in time [26].To the best of our knowledge, Prony’s method has not been used to filter mfVEP signals. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the contribution that filtering in the Prony domain makes to improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of mfVEP signals obtained from healthy subjects.
