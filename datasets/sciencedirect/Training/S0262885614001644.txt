@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Feature correspondence lays the foundation for many tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper the directed structural model is utilized to represent the feature set, and the correspondence problem is then formulated as the structural model matching. Compared with the undirected structural model, the proposed directed model provides more discriminating ability and invariance against rotation and scale transformations. Finally, the recently proposed convex–concave relaxation procedure (CCRP) is generalized to approximately solve the problem. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data witness the effectiveness of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, feature correspondence plays an important role in many tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and bio-informatics. Although the correspondence using only appearance descriptors such as SIFT descriptor [24], shape context feature [1] or bag-of-words model [20] got good results in some tasks such as object detection and image classification [32,10,35,36], recently much effort has been devoted to the incorporation of spatial information into the appearance cue [6,33,25,2,15,26]. Consequently, the feature correspondence can be in general formulated as a combination of a unary term related to the appearance similarity and a pairwise term describing the spatial consistency.Intuitively, the pairwise constraints could improve the correspondence performance. For example, if we add the distance constraint, then a pair of feature points close to each other in one set is less likely to be assigned to the points far away from each other in another set. However, researchers [6] showed that the appearance only based methods performed comparably or even better than the structural ones. In fact, the performance of pairwise constraints depends largely on the structural model constructed, and an unstable descriptor may result in bad performance in practice. For instance, the same object in different images may appear in different scales, orientations, and suffers from other types of distortions. It is thus far from easy to construct a stable structural model invariant to these geometric transformations. The distance descriptor is robust against rotation, but often vulnerable to scale and other types of transformations. The orientation descriptor is robust against scale, but not rotation.In this paper, we propose a robust directed structural model to tackle the equal-sized correspondence problem. By representing the feature set by the directed structural model or equivalently the directed graph, the correspondence is formulated as a directed graph matching and then approximately solved by generalizing the recently proposed convex–concave relaxation procedure (CCRP).
