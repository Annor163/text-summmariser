@&#ABSTRACT@&#
During the last decade, energy regulatory policies all over the globe have been influenced by the introduction of competition. In a multi-area deregulated power market, competitive bidding and allocation of energy and reserve is crucial for maintaining performance and reliability. The increased penetration of intermittent renewable generation requires for sufficient allocation of reserve services to maintain security and reliability. As a result the market operators and generating companies are opting for market models for joint energy and reserve dispatch with a cost minimization/profit maximization goal. The joint dispatch (JD) problem is more complex than the traditional economic dispatch (ED) due to the additional constraints like the reserve limits, transmission limits, area power balance, energy-reserve coupling constraints and separate sectional price offer curves for both, energy and reserve.The present work proposes a model for the joint static/dynamic dispatch of energy and reserve in deregulated market for multi-area operation using enhanced versions of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). A parameter automation strategy is employed in the classical PSO and DE algorithms (i) to enhance their search capability; (ii) to avoid premature convergence; and (iii) to maintain a balance between global and local search. The performance of enhanced PSO and DE variants is compared for single/multi-area power systems for static/dynamic operation, taking both linear and non-smooth cost functions. The proposed approach is validated on two test systems for different demands, reserve requirements, tie-line capacities and generator outages.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Deregulation of the electricity industry has effectively created market competition for improving the economy of power system operation all over the globe. In the competitive environment, reserve plays a significant role in maintaining an adequate level of security and supply reliability. The independent system operator (ISO) coordinates the allocation of energy and reserve to optimally balance reliability and security [1]. Transmission limits and generator outages affect the optimal energy and reserve allocations significantly.The problem of joint energy and reserve dispatch in a multi-area competitive market requires the introduction of new concepts. Commercial interest can affect the generator characteristics i.e. the generators may change their bid prices for improving their profit. Spinning reserve (SR) is defined as the unloaded fraction of generation that is able to respond immediately to serve load. In traditional vertically integrated electricity markets, energy and reserve are dealt in separate markets [1,2]. In such markets only the generators submit their bids and the system operator sequentially allocates the required reserve after the energy market has been cleared. In competitive markets inefficiencies created by the sequential model are avoided by carrying out a joint dispatch of generation and reserve [3–21]. In [3] the bid-clearing model is formulated to minimize the total cost of energy and ancillary service offers. A linear programming (LP) based approach is presented with reserve constraints, security limits, and sharing of resource capacity [4]. A direct search method is used for the joint sequential dispatch to minimize the total market cost considering tie-line congestion and area SR [5]. In [6] the growing role of reserve in competitive bidding in pool market is explored. The analysis of cost-effective dispatching of emergency reserve is addressed in [7] with a focus on supply and demand side options. A flexible A joint static dispatch (JSD) approach is presented in [8] to meet real time demand-supply imbalances. Two models using mixed integer non-linear programming (MI-NLP) are presented in [9] for minimizing the payment and for minimizing the cost by simultaneous dispatch of energy and reserve. A flexible multi-agent competitive electricity market simulator is developed in [10] for joint dispatch of a real market. A JSD in electricity market is presented in [11] with non convexities due to the fixed costs and capacity constraints of generation. In [12] the detailed modeling of the automatic generation control (AGC) regulating characteristics of thermal units is formulated. In [13], a security-constrained unit commitment model is proposed for optimizing reserve requirements in electricity markets. Joint dispatch of demand response and distributed generation is proposed in [14]. Reference [15] proposes joint energy and SR dispatch for wind-thermal system using covariant matrix adaptation with evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and mean learning technique.Among traditional approaches, application of interior point algorithm can be found for solving joint dispatch [21]. In [17] a theoretical equilibrium model is proposed for energy and reserve markets. An extensive review of energy and reserve markets focusing on reserve types (primary, secondary and tertiary), dispatching methods (sequential vs. joint), and different modeling approaches is also presented [17]. An adjustable robust optimization approach and Benders decomposition are used for solving a single period contingency constrained scheduling of energy and reserves considering transmission flow limits [18]. A joint energy and reserve scheduling is carried out with line switching to reduce operating cost and improve performance in the event of a contingency [19]. Energy and reserve scheduling with a stochastic method has been proposed for smart grid using demand participation and renewable power [20].For joint dispatch problems meta-heuristic optimization techniques such as constrained particle swarm optimization (CPSO) [21] genetic algorithm (GA) [22–24], differential evolution (DE) [25,26], recurring DE [27], memetic algorithm (MA) [28] and harmony search (HS) [29] have been applied very effectively. Novel meta-heuristic methods such as cuckoo search [30], Krill herd algorithm [31], gravitational search [32], PSO with crazy particles [33] etc. were proposed for optimal dispatch in recent years.Economic dispatch (ED) is a very important and widely researched area in power system and for the last couple of years nonconvex, non-smooth and multi-modal cost functions have been used by researchers for modeling ED [30–33]. However joint energy and reserve dispatch has received comparatively limited attention. The joint dispatch can be static or dynamic (JSD/JDD). A joint static dispatch (JSD) is performed for only one time interval whereas the joint dynamic dispatch (JDD) takes into consideration the changes in energy and reserve demands over a time period consisting of many continuous time intervals. The constantly varying energy and reserve demands are computed by the independent system operator (ISO) using short-term/day-ahead load forecasting tools.The JDD is a more realistic and practical representation of energy and reserve scheduling as it considers the internal coupling of generating units represented by ramp rate constraints imposed on generating unit operation due to which the search space is dynamically modified. Therefore the JDD is more complex than the JSD.Further, the multi-zone joint static/dynamic dispatch (JSD/JDD) in a competitive energy market is more complicated than the traditional ED, as it needs to address several new issues, such as, (i) joint dispatch for energy and reserve is based on price bids and not on generator cost curves; (ii) separate bids for reserve are to be considered; (iii) inter area tie-line power flow limits play an important role as different zones share energy and reserve resources; (iv) energy as well as reserve is to be dispatched such that mutual coupling constraints between these two commodities are satisfied.All the papers which have addressed joint dispatch problem are static approaches [2–28]. Dynamic model of JD is recently proposed in [29] but for the sake of simplicity only single area operation with linear cost functions is considered in it. This paper presents the joint dispatch for multi-area operation with non-smooth cost functions.With multi-area operation, non-smooth cost function, and all other constraints the joint dynamic dispatch (JDD) becomes very complex. This problem cannot be solved using traditional mathematical methods, hence enhanced PSO and DE models are being employed for this problem in this paper.The main contribution of this paper is (i) formulation of JDD with non smooth cost functions; (ii) study of the mutual relationship between market cost, generator contingencies and tie-line capacities; (iii) comparison of detailed JDD solution for single and multi-zone operation; and (iv) result comparison using PSO and DE variants.This paper presents the solution of the optimal JSD/JDD for the multi-area electricity market with generator outages and complex equality/inequality constraints like energy and reserve capacity limits, their mutual coupling constraints, zonal power balance constraints, transmission constraints, ramp rate limits and convex, nonconvex and sectional cost characteristics.The performance of the proposed approach is tested and validated for multi-area energy and reserve dispatch using enhanced time varying PSO and DE algorithms. The improved PSO and DE variants were selected for comparison because these two algorithms have received immense research focus for solving real-world problems in recent years.The operational policies adopted in deregulated power system for maintaining supply security and reliability are quite different from the traditional policies. In this paper, the JSD and JDD are formulated for energy and reserve in practical multi-area power system with generator outage. Sectional price characteristics with and without valve point loading effects are assumed for calculating the cost of energy and reserve.The JSD for a sample two-area electricity market shown in Fig. 1is formulated below. Area A and area B have m and n numbers of generators respectively. The power and reserve allocated to the ith generator in area A and B are represented by PiA, RiAand PiB, RiBrespectively. The tie-line power flow from area A to B is shown as TAB, power demand as PDA, PDBand the reserve requirement as RDA, RDB. If inelastic load is assumed, then cost minimization instead of profit maximization can be considered. The object of joint static dispatch is to minimize the total energy and reserve cost CTSwhich can be expressed for the sample two-area case as [20,21,21](1)minCTS=∑i=1m[F(PiA)+G(RiA)]+∑j=1n[F(PjB)+G(RjB)]where F(PiA) and G(RiA) represent the energy and reserve bids of the ith generating unit in area ‘A’, and ‘m’ and ‘n’ are the number of units in the two areas respectively. This model can be easily extended for multiple areas.The JDD is a more realistic representation of practical power system operation where day ahead optimal scheduling of energy and reserve is carried out based on bids from suppliers. For given price bids, the object of JDD is to maximize profit by minimizing total cost CTDfor a given period of time (consisting of several intervals taken in continuation), such that demand is met and all other inequality constraints are satisfied at every instant. For each interval (t) different energy and reserve demands are to be fulfilled such that all limits are satisfied. For the model 2-area system shown in Fig. 1, the total cost for the dispatch period consisting of ‘T’ number of intervals can be stated as,(2)minCTD=∑t=1T∑i=1m[F(PiA(t))+G(RiA(t))]+∑t=1T∑j=1n[F(PjB(t))+G(RjB(t))]F(PiA(t)) and G(RiA(t)) are the energy and reserve bid prices of the ith generating unit at tth time interval respectively. The cost equations specified by (1) and (2) can be easily extended for multi-area systems. The constraints for the JSD/JDD are stated below for multi-area case. In (3)–(9) below, for the joint static dispatch, ‘t’ is only one time period or state while the joint dynamic dispatch is a multi-period formulation where the neighboring periods are coupled by ramping constraints. The complete dispatch period, T is typically 24h. The constraints for the JSD/JDD for a power system having ‘M’ numbers of areas can be given as:i)Area-wise power balance constraint for the Qth area having Nqunits is represented neglecting power loss as(3)∑i=1NqPiQ(t)=PDQ(t)+∑j=1MTj,Q(t)suchthatj≠Q,∀t&∀QArea-wise spinning reserve constraint for the Qth area is given as(4)∑i=1NqRiQ(t)=RDQ(t)|∀t&∀QHere, PDQ(t) and RDQ(t) are power and reserve requirements of the Qth area at the tth time interval respectively and Tj,Qrepresents tie-line power flow between other areas and the Qth area. The total number of units and tie-lines in the power systems are ‘N’ and ‘NTL’ respectively. The generation and reserve limits of the ith unit are Pimin, Pimax and Rimax respectively. The tie-line limits of the kth tieline are given by Tkmin, Tkmax respectively.Unit energy capacity constraints(5)Pimin≤Pi(t)≤Pimax;∀i,tUnit reserve capacity constraints;(6)0≤Ri(t)≤Rimax;∀i,tTie-line capacity constraints given as(7)Tkmin≤Tk(t)≤Tkmax;∀i,tUnit energy and reserve coupling constraints(8)Pi(t)+Ri(t)≤Pimax;∀i,tUnit ramp-rate constraints given by:(9)−DRi≤(Pi(t)−Pi(t−1))≤URi;∀i,tThe objective is the minimization of total cost of energy and reserve (given by (1) for JSD and by (2) for JDD) such that all constraints specified from (3) to (9) are satisfied. Two cost functions having (i) block cost characteristics and (ii) nonconvex block cost characteristics with valve point loading effects are employed.The SR is the capacity which is made available on demand within a short time. Each generator is assumed to offer sectional energy/reserve offering price curve [9]. For each power range or power band of a generator, a particular energy offering price and reserve offering price is submitted as shown in Fig. 2. The energy and SR bidding prices are assumed to be three distinct bounds. The bidding price corresponding to each bound is a constant value. The energy and reserve prices for the ith generator can be calculated as(10)F(Pi)=ρGi(k−1)×Pi.....if....Pi≤PGi(k−1)ρGi(k−1)×PGi(k−1)+(Pi−PGi(k−1))×ρGik;if.....PGi(k−1)<Pi≤PGikρGi(k−1)×PGi(k−1)+(PGik−PGi(k−1))×ρGik+(Pi−PGik)×ρGi(k+1)....if....PGik<Pi(11)G(Ri)=ρRi(k−1)×RiifRi≤RRi(k−1)ρRi(k−1)×RRi(k−1)+(Ri−RRi(k−1))×ρRik;ifRRi(k−1)<Ri≤RRikρRi(k−1)×RRi(k−1)+(RRik−RRi(k−1))×ρRik+(Ri−RRik)×ρGi(k+1);ifRRik<RiThe offering prices of the ith generator for energy and spinning reserve in the kth power interval are ρGikand ρRik, variables PGi(k-1), PGikand RRi(k-1), RRikrepresent the energy and reserve bids for the kth interval.Sometimes the conventional ED concept can be applied for bidding energy prices; therefore the second objective function in this paper is with valve-point and multiple fuels described as a superposition of sinusoidal functions and piecewise quadratic functions. The sectional cost function with/without multi-fuel option is shown in Fig. 3. The cost function for jth generating unit with multiple fuel options and valve-point effects can be expressed as(12)F(Pj)=aj1Pj2+bj1Pj+cj1+|ej1×sin(dj1×(Pjmin−Pj))|ifPjmin≤Pj≤Pj1aj2Pj2+bj2Pj+cj2+|ej2×sin(dj2×(Pjmin−Pj))|+Shj1ifPj1≤Pj≤Pj2.ajpPj2+bjpPj+cjp+|ejp×sin(djp×(Pjmin−Pj))|+shj(p−1)ifPj(p−1)≤Pj≤Pjmaxwhere ajp, bjp, cjp, ejp, djpare the cost coefficients of the jth generator and shj(p-1)is the shift coefficient for the pth bound [21].When the ith generating unit of the Qth area is out for maintenance or due to fault, the objective functions for joint static and dynamic dispatch given by (1) and (2) will be optimized subject to constraints (3)–(9) such that for outage of ith unit PiQ=0 and RiQ=0. In this condition if∑iPiQ<PDQplus available power from other areas or∑iRi<RDthen the solution obtained is considered to be infeasible and the algorithm would not converge as shown in the result section (Table 4).It is evident from literature that both PSO and DE have shown immense popularity among researchers for solving those complex real-world problems which otherwise cannot be solved using classical methods. Due to easy implementation, fast convergence and ability to maintain solution diversity these two methods have found more focus as compared to the other nature inspired optimization algorithms [34]. Therefore, in this paper PSO [35] and DE [36] were selected for finding optimal solutions for the joint dispatch problem.The original PSO algorithm [36] employs a swarm population to navigate through the search domain by making use of self best position (pbest) and the position of the best particle (gbest). The former represents the exploration capability of the swarm while the latter controls the exploitation potential during the search. In classical PSO these two effects are controlled by using fixed values of coefficients which sometimes causes premature convergence problem. But in the improved PSO with time-varying acceleration coefficients (PSO_TVAC), coefficients are dynamically varied to get a better balance between exploration (managed by cognitive coefficient) and exploitation (managed by social coefficient) [39,40].Instead of keeping the coefficients fixed at some value throughout the optimization process, they are varied in a wide range to enhance the search and to avoid stagnation. The parameter values are varied in such a manner that initially exploration is carried out and during the later stage of the search exploitation is encouraged.The variation of coefficients in a wide range allows the swarm to extensively explore the problem domain. Another advantage is that repeated trial and runs are not required to find the optimal set of coefficients or tuning parameters in meta-heuristic algorithms. To save time in finding optimal parameters and to improve performance (i) random, (ii) chaotic or (iii) linearly increasing/decreasing parameters can be used [37,38,41]. In this paper the cognitive and social coefficients of PSO_TVAC model are varied linearly between the maximum and minimum values.The initial position and velocity vectors of the ithparticle of a d-dimensional search space are set as Xi0=(xi1, xi2, ............xid) andVi0=(vi1,vi2,........vid)respectively. The velocity of the ithparticle in the (t+1)thiteration is calculated using the PSO_TVAC as given below [39,40].(13)vidt+1=w×vidt+(c1final−c1start)iteritermax+c1start×rand1×(pbestid−xid)+(c2final−c2ndart)iteritermax+c2ndart×rand2×(gbestd−xid)The initial/final values of cognitive/social acceleration coefficients are represented by c1,start, c1,final, c2,startand c2,finalrespectively. Here iter and itermax stand for running iteration count and maximum iteration count respectively, w is the inertial weight, rand1 and rand2 are random numbers lying between 0 and 1. The particle position in the subsequent iteration can be computed by adding the velocity vector found by (13) as(14)xidt+1=xidt+vidt+1Differential evolution (DE) [35] has been extensively used over the last decade for solving complex optimization problems in power system. DE works on three basic operations, namely mutation, crossover and selection. There are three important issues in DE, (i) the method for creating the mutated population, (ii) the number of difference vectors that will be used to form the mutant vector and the (iii) issue is which crossover method is used to create the offspring population.For generating mutant vector is DE, the difference of two solutions from the population is multiplied by a mutation rate. After experimenting with linear, exponential, chaotic and Gaussian variation of mutation rates, it was found that chaotic variation of mutation produced the best results for all tested cases. Therefore, in this paper a chaotically varying mutation rate has been used instead of taking a fixed mutation rate. For generating the mutant vector Zifrom target vector xia chaotically varying mutation rate fmis employed.(15)Zi(t+1)=xi(t)+fm[xi,best(t)−xi(t)]+fm[xir1(t)−xir2(t)]The random integers r1, r2, and r3 are mutually different and also different from index i. The mutation factor fmis varied chaotically from an initial value f2ito a final value f2fwith time as given below. The parameters display chaotic behavior when μ=4 andfm(0)∉0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0and index i ∈ population size R. Three DE variants are used having different pattern of variation for the mutation rate [37,38]. The Variant 1 is given by:(16)fm(t)=μ×fm(t−1)×[1−fm(t−1)]The Variant 2 and Variant 3 are is given by (17) and (18) respectively:(17)fm(t)=(f2f−f2i)iteritermax+f2i×μ×fm(t−1)×[1−fm(t−1)](18)fm(t)=(f2i−f2f)iteritermax+f2f×μ×fm(t−1)×[1−fm(t−1)]For all the three variants described above, binomial crossover is applied to generate a trial vector by replacing randomly selected parameters of the target vector with the corresponding parameters of the randomly generated mutant vector Zi. rand(j) is a uniform random number ∈ [0,1], and CR is a crossover rate in the range [0,1].(19)Uij(t+1)=Zij(t+1),if(rand(j)≤CR)or(j=randint(i))xij(t),if(rand(j)>CR)or(j≠randint(i))Greedy selection is carried out to decide whether the trial vector should replace the target vector in the next generation population. The vectors are compared for a minimization problem as per the following logic:(20)xi(t+1)=Ui(t+1)if(u(t+1)<f(xi(t)))xi(t),otherwiseThis section presents the step by step solution procedure of the JSD/JDD of energy and reserve for multi-area power system in competitive market employing improved DE with chaotic mutation. The detailed flow chart for proposed method is given in Fig. 4.Step 1) Parameter setup: The DE parameters such as population size, variable bounds, mutation strategy to be adopted, the initial and final mutation factors, the crossover rate (CR), and the stopping criterion are selected.Step 2) Defining a population: For fast convergence, it is necessary to ensure generation of a feasible initial population as shown in step 3 and 4 below. The population individuals for the joint dispatch problem are (i) energy and reserve dispatches of generating units and (ii) tie-line flows. For dynamic dispatch, the ith individual population is represented as(21)Xi(t)=(Pi,1(t),Pi,2(t)Pi,3(t)……Pi,N(t),Ti,1(t),Ti,2(t)……Ti,NTL(t),Ri,1(t),Ri,2(t)……Ri,N(t))The ith population for JDD over a time period consisting of T number of discrete intervals is expressed as(22)Xi=[Xi(1),Xi(2)…………Xi(T)]TStep 3) Implementation of inequality constraints of the initial population: Population is randomly generated between maximum and minimum limits to satisfy constraints (5)–(7). The jth dimension of the ith individual of the population is initialized as shown in (23)–(25). Here, r1, r2 and r3 are random numbers between [0,1].(23)Pij=Pjmin+r1(Pjmax−Pjmin)(24)Rij=Rjmin+r2(Rjmax−Rjmin)(25)Tij=Tjmin+r3(Tjmax−Tjmin)For satisfying constraint given by (8), the reserve dispatch of jth generator of the ith population is initialized as(26)Rij=min{(Pjmax−Pij),Rij}Step 4) Implementation of equality constraints: To minimize the cost while constraints given by (3) and (4) are satisfied, the squared or absolute violations are added to the cost function when the equality constraints are not satisfied. The evaluation function for optimal JSD/JDD for the 2-area system is given by (27) and (28)(27)minCTS+α∑i−1mPiA−TAB−PDA2+β∑i=1nPiB+TAB−PDB2+γ∑i=1(m+n)Rim+n−(RDA+RDB)2(28)minCTD+∑t=1Tα∑i−1mPiA(t)−TAB(t)−PDA(t)2+β∑i=1nPiB(t)+TAB(t)−PDB(t)2+γ∑i=1(m+n)Rim+n(t)−(RDA(t)+RDB(t))2The above functions can be extended for multiple areas. Here, α, β and γ are the penalty coefficients. These values are selected such that an infeasible solution gets higher cost as compared to a feasible solution.Step5) Generation of trial vector using chaotic mutation and binomial crossover: A mutant vector is generated for each individual as described in (15)–(18) and a trial vector is generated using crossover as give in (19).Step 6) Implementation of ramp rate constraints: The ramp rates given by (9) dynamically modify the solution space which is reflected by changing the lower/upper bounds of unit capacity.Step 7) Population update using greedy selection: The values of the evaluation function are calculated for the trial vector. The trial vector replaces its parent target vector if its evaluation is found to be better otherwise the target vector is allowed to proceed to the next generation as in (20).Step 8) Stopping criterion: Maximum iteration count is adopted as the stopping criterion in this paper.
