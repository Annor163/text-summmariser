Compressed sensing recovers a sparse signal from a small set of linear, nonadaptive measurements. A sparse signal can be represented by compressed measurements with a reduced number of projections on a set of random vectors. In this paper, a multiscale compressed sensing based processing is investigated for an electrocardiogram signal which yields coded measurements. In case of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the coded measurements are expected to retain the clinical information. To achieve this, compressed sensing based processing is applied at each wavelet scale and measurements are coded using Huffman coder. The measurements at each scale use random sensing matrix with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries formed by sampling a Gaussian distribution. The proposed method is evaluated using pathological ECG signals from the CSE database, synthetic and normal ECGs. It helps preserve the pathological information and clinical components in compressed signal. The compressed signal quality is evaluated using standard distortion measures and mean opinion score (MOS). The MOS values for the signals range from5%to8.3%with a wavelet energy based diagnostic distortion (WEDD) value of9.46%which falls under the excellent category.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging framework of signal processing where a sparse signal is recovered from a few samples [1,2]. It can reconstruct the signal from a set of highly incomplete measurements, which is conventionally believed to have insufficient information. This can be achieved if the signal has a sparse representation with an orthonormal basis. Since the last decade, a number of studies have been carried out on this novel idea to realize various signal and image processing applications [3,4]. Attempts have been made to acquire data directly in a lower dimensional subspace with, M, projections rather than its conventional higher dimensional projections, N, whereM≪N. The possible research directions in sparse representation are discussed by various researchers [5–7]. The general framework for signal processing with compressive measurements has been discussed by Davenport et al. [8]. In time domain, CS has been applied to single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for data compression in wireless body sensor networks [9]. For multi-lead ECG, compressed measurements were acquired using wavelet basis [10]. For ECG data compression, a joint sparsity model is used to exploit intra and inter-signal correlations [11]. CS based data acquisition system with wireless bio-sensors is proposed for bio-signals like ECG and EMG [12]. For wireless telemonitoring of fetal ECG (FECG), for compression and reconstruction of non-sparse raw FECG recordings, block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework is proposed [13]. In an ECG signal, clinically essential diagnostic information such as P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave are present. These clinical components may carry pathological information. Application of CS based signal processing should not alter these information. Sparse representation is an essential requirement for successful implementation of CS when applied to an ECG signal. Thus, sparsity of the signal in wavelet scales can be exploited for application of compressive sensing. Multi-resolution decomposition of an ECG signal results in gross segmentation of its clinical information into different wavelet subbands [14–16]. It is similar to the different principal component (PC) capturing diagnostic components when principal component analysis (PCA) [17] is applied to ECG. The wavelet coefficients of higher order subbands capture most of the energy of the signal whereas lower order subbands contain less energy. Thus, the signal can be viewed as a representation having varied degrees of sparsity at different scales. The sparse characteristics of wavelet coefficients at different scales and the gross segmentation of the clinical information can help implementation of CS more efficiently, retaining diagnostic information. So, a multiscale compressive sensing (MCS) based signal processing which gives coded measurements of an ECG signal is proposed and investigated. However, it is assumed that the ECG signal is passed through analog-to-digital converter as in ‘digital CS’ [9,13]. The proposed methodology is presented in Section 2. Section 3 shows and discusses the results and a brief conclusion is presented in Section 4.
