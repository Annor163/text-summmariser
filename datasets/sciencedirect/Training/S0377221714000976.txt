@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We provide a novel approach to characterize the order process of continuous review(s,S)and(r,nQ)inventory policies, and study the impact of the batching parameter (the value of Q orS-s) on the variability in the order process. First, we characterize the distribution of the time between orders, as well as the distribution of order sizes. We find that the coefficient of variation (cv) of the time between orders is smaller than the cv of the time between demands. The size of the orders can exhibit either variance amplification or dampening, compared to the demand sizes, depending on the demand size distribution and the value of the batching parameter. This may motivate a supplier to adjust his imposed fixed order cost to influence the batching size. Second, we look at the compound order process, defined by the number of units ordered during an arbitrary interval. The compound order process always exhibits variance amplification compared to the compound demand, which increases linearly in the batching parameter for large values of Q orS-s; for small values, the variance amplification is fluctuating. We point out that the time interval, during which the number of units ordered/demanded is observed, also impacts the level of variance amplification, and we show to what extent larger time intervals (resulting in more aggregation of the data) lead to lower values of variance amplification. Both perspectives (looking at time between orders and order quantities, or observing the compound order process) provide useful information for the upstream supplier.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the early fifties, Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951) introduced the(s,S)inventory policy as a way to balance the cost of inventory with the cost of placing orders, hence exploiting the economies of scale when ordering. In an(s,S)inventory policy, a lower stock level s and an upper stock level S are established: no order is placed until inventories fall to s or below, whereupon an order is placed to restore the inventory position to the level S. This means that orders are placed with a batch size, that is always larger than or equal to the value ofS-s. The more the inventory level falls below s (which depends on the stochastic demand size observed prior to the order is placed), the more the order quantity will exceedS-s; this is the stochastic overshoot. Several authors showed, in different settings, that an(s,S)policy is optimal when a fixed order cost is present (Iglehart, 1963; ?; Scarf, 1960; Veinott, 1966). Today, the(s,S)inventory policy is still of main importance to inventory theory and ordering policies and is incorporated in business software of many companies all over the world (Caplin & Leahy, 2010).When materials flow in fixed batch sizes, such as full truckloads or containers, an(r,nQ)inventory policy can be adopted, which is comparable, but slightly different to the(s,S)policy (Federgruen & Zheng, 1992; Li & Sridharan, 2008). In an(r,nQ)inventory policy, if the inventory position reaches the order point r, an order is placed equal to the smallest multiple of Q that raises the inventory position above r.In the supply chain literature it is widely accepted that batching of orders creates a bullwhip effect, indicating that the variability in the order process is larger than the variability in demand (see e.g., Burbidge, 1961; Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997; Potter & Disney, 2006). This distorted information can lead to serious inefficiencies upstream in the supply chain (Lee et al., 1997). It is argued that larger batch sizes create more bullwhip (e.g., Burbidge, 1961), and hence batching is to be avoided. However, Potter and Disney (2006) state: “While it is often advocated that batch sizes should be reduced as much as possible, there has been limited investigation into the impact of batching on bullwhip. Placing an order of a single item is not always possible, due to technical, economical or social reasons.” Therefore, it is worthwhile to gain insight how batch sizes impact the variability of the order process.This insight can be useful, especially for an upstream supplier who suffers from a highly variable order process, as this impacts his inventory levels and/or production times. In many practical settings, the upstream supplier charges a fixed order cost to its customer. Based on this fixed order cost, the customer decides on the batching parameter. Therefore, if the upstream supplier understands how the batching parameter impacts the order process variability, he may adjust the fixed order cost of his customer in order to manipulate the resulting order process.In this paper, we characterize the order process (and its variability) that is generated by a continuous review(s,S)or(r,nQ)inventory policy. These policies are commonly used when a fixed order cost is present. We look at the time between orders and the size of the orders placed and we characterize the distribution of both. This information can be relevant, for instance, if the upstream supplier produces on order: to characterize the arrival rate of his production orders, and thus his production lead times, he needs to know the mean and variance of the inter-arrival times between orders and of the size of the orders to be produced. This separate characterization of time between orders and order quantities is also useful when, for instance, the upstream supplier decides on the parameters of his own inventory policy as they are both needed to characterize the intermittent demand process, that is created by the(s,S)or(r,nQ)policy of his customer (e.g., Teunter & Duncan, 2008).Besides looking at the time between orders and order quantities separately, we also look at the number of units that are ordered in an arbitrary time interval t (which we call the “compound” order process). This information is useful, for instance, when the upstream supplier reviews its orders on a periodic basis of interval t and as such aggregates the number of units that are ordered during this time interval. In this case, we cannot simply rely on the characterization of the time between orders and the order quantities, as these might be correlated.Fig. 1illustrates the compound order (and demand) process for an(s,S)policy, showing the total number of units that are ordered (and demanded) during time interval t. Whent=1, it represents the number of units ordered (resp. demanded) every time unit (Fig. 1(a)), which is either zero if no order is placed, or an order is placed with size greater than or equal toS-s. If the value ofS-sgrows, the variability of this compound order process is likely to increase as the number of zero-orders goes up and the discrepancy between an order of size zero and an order size of at leastS-sunits grows. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the compound process whent=20: in this case we aggregate the number of units that are demanded and ordered in an interval of 20 time units (this might be appropriate if the upstream supplier reviews his inventory every 20 periods, and thus wants to know how many units were ordered in this time window). Clearly, the longer the interval t, the lower the probability of observing an interval with zero-orders and the more aggregation on the number of units ordered. This leads to less fluctuations in the observed order process. In other words, the choice of the interval t has a great impact on the variability of the observed order process.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the related literature. In Section 3 we introduce our model and notations. Section 4 provides the characterization of the order process of an(s,S)and an(r,nQ)policy as a batch Markovian arrival process. Section 5 is devoted to the analysis of the time between orders, and of the order quantities. In Section 6 the compound order process is analyzed. In Section 7 we provide some numerical illustrations for uniform, Poisson and bimodal distributed demand sizes. Section 8 concludes.The bullwhip effect, which refers to the increased volatility in the order process compared to the observed demand, has been observed in many supply chains and has a number of highly undesirable cost implications (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 2004). Many papers have studied the impact of adapting the parameters of the inventory replenishment rules on the order variance amplification, mostly in a base-stock policy (e.g., Boute, Disney, Lambrecht, & Van Houdt, 2007; Disney & Towill, 2003; Warburton, 2004; Warburton & Disney, 2007). In this paper we study the impact of order batching policies on the bullwhip effect.Burbidge (1961) recognized order batching as a main driver of order variance amplification in supply chains. Blinder (1981) empirically showed the existence of an increased order size variability between wholesalers and retailers and suggested that the use of(s,S)inventory models by retailers could be a possible explanation for this. Also Schultz (1983), Lee et al. (1997), Li and Sridharan (2008), and Chen and Lee (2012) attributed the existence of a bullwhip effect due to order batching.To gain insight into the impact of order batching on the bullwhip effect, Schultz (1983) provides an exact formula of the order variance caused by a periodic review(s,S)policy. Based on this formula he shows that the order variance always exceeds the demand variance. Grounded on the exact formula of Schultz (1983), Schneider, Rinks, and Kelle (1995) derive an approximation. The derivation of the formula is based on asymptotic renewal theory, therefore it only holds for “large” values ofS-s. Based on this approximation, they show that the order variance amplification increases in the value ofS-s. Kelle and Milne (1999) provide some numerical experiments in which the approximation is compared to simulation. For normal and gamma distributed demand, they find that the relative error is smaller than 1% when the coefficient of variation of demand is larger than three and the ratio ofS-swith respect to the average demand is smaller than 0.7.For a variant of the periodic review(r,nQ)policy, Potter and Disney (2006) show for deterministic demand and “small” values of Q (i.e., Q smaller than or equal to the demand), that the bullwhip effect (as a function of Q) reaches a local minimum when the quotient of Q and the (constant) demand is an integer. A numerical analysis shows that halfway two local minima, a local maximum is reached, and the height of this maximum increases as Q grows larger. Based on a simulation study, the authors also explore the same policy with stochastic demand, and observe that the bullwhip effect is a function of the average demand taken modulo Q.Caplin (1985) studies a continuous review(s,S)policy with a single unit demand process. He shows analytically that for large values ofS-s, the bullwhip effect increases linearly inS-s, whereas for small values ofS-s, the degree of bullwhip is quantified byE[b(Q-b)]with b a random variable equal to the demand process taken moduloS-s, and Q equal toS-s. Li and Sridharan (2008) obtain a similar result for a periodic review(r,nQ)policy, with stationary demand that may be correlated over time. Chen and Lee (2012) generalize Caplin’s bullwhip expression for a periodic(r,nQ)policy and finite capacity.There are a few papers that look at the impact of the time interval (during which the number of units demanded/ordered is observed) on the level of bullwhip. Cachon (1999) showed (for a periodic review(r,nQ)policy) that increasing the review period decreases the order variance. A similar conclusion was made by Chen and Lee (2012) (also for a periodic review(r,nQ)policy), who showed that aggregating data over longer time periods reduces the observed magnitude of the bullwhip effect.In this paper, we show that the order process of continuous review(s,S)and(r,nQ)policies can be characterized by a batch Markovian arrival process, assuming a compound Poisson demand. Using this property, we describe the distribution of the time between orders placed, and the distribution of the order quantities. We provide formulas for the first two moments of the inter-arrival times between orders and of the size of the orders, which give extra insight in the order process compared to what is common in the existing literature.Second, we define the total number of units ordered in a time interval and characterize the variance of this number as a function of the interval of length t. This variance provides insight in the compound order process taking the time between orders, the order quantities, and a possible correlation between the two into account. We confirm and extend the results concerning the impact of the batching parameter and the time interval on the order variance amplification, for random batch sizes and general time intervals. Whereas the majority of the literature studies periodic review policies, to the best of our knowledge, Caplin (1985) is the only paper that studies the impact of a continuous review(s,S)policy on the bullwhip ratio. Where Caplin (1985) assumes single-unit demand, we take general demand sizes into account, which results in the possibility of overshoots.Note that in an(s,S)and(r,nQ)policy, the order process is based on the inventory positions, which are – for a given set of(s,S)and(r,nQ)parameters – not influenced by lead times (only the order points s and r are influenced by the lead time). Therefore, in this paper we do not study the impact of lead times on the bullwhip effect.We assume a single product model with customer demand characterized by a compound (batch) Poisson process. This means that the time between subsequent demand arrivals is exponentially distributed with parameterλand demand sizes are discrete identically distributed random variables. Our analysis holds for any arbitrary finite demand size distribution with maximum demand size m (whenm=1, the demand process reduces to a pure Poisson process with parameterλ). In Section 7 we provide numerical illustrations when the demand size follows a discrete uniform, a truncated Poisson, and a delayed geometric distribution. We use D to denote the random demand size variable,dithe probability of a demand of size i,μdkthe average demand size andσdk2its variance. Although throughout this paper, we will work with the compound Poisson demand assumption, large parts of our analysis can also be readily extended to more general demand processes, such as a phase-type renewal process, a Markov-modulated or even a general batch Markovian arrival process. However, the analysis in such a case becomes more involved (as scalars need to be replaced by matrices) and may not necessarily give more insights.Inventory is controlled by an(s,S)or by an(r,nQ)inventory policy. It is assumed that inventory positions are continuously monitored, and consequently orders can be placed at any time. In case of a stockout, unmet demand is backlogged. Let O denote the random order size variable. Then, orders in an(s,S)inventory policy are of sizeO∈{S-s,S-s+1,…S-s+m-1}, depending on the observed customer demand prior to the order was placed (and its overshoot). We denoteπ(i)as the probability that the order is of size i in an(s,S)policy,μokthe average order size andσok2its variance.In an(r,nQ)policy, the orders have random sizeO∈{Q,2Q,…,⌈mQ⌉Q}. Denoteπˆ(i)as the probability to order i units in an(r,nQ)policy,μˆokthe average order size andσˆok2its variance. Note that whenQ⩾m, the order size is always Q. WhenS-s=1orQ=1, the(s,S)and the(r,nQ)inventory policy reduce to an order-up-to or base-stock policy. This policy, which is optimal in absence of a fixed order cost, is also referred to as an(S-1,S)policy (Nahmias, 1997; Zipkin, 2000).For both an(s,S)and(r,nQ)policy, the time between orders placed is stochastic. We useμotandσot2to denote the average time and variance of the time between orders placed in an(s,S)policy. Similarly,μˆotandσˆot2denote the average time and variance of the time between orders placed in an(r,nQ)policy.We denoteαas the vector to represent the steady-state probabilities of having a given inventory position immediately after a replenishment has occurred, when an(s,S)policy is used, respectivelyαˆwhen an(r,nQ)policy is used. The steady-state probabilities of having a given inventory position at a random point in time is denoted byθwhen an(s,S)is used, andθˆwhen an(r,nQ)policy is used.Finally, defineM(t)as the number of demand arrivals received during an interval t, andMB(t)the number of units that are demanded in interval t. Similarly, defineN(t)as the number of orders placed during an interval t, andNB(t)the number of units that are ordered in interval t.pzdenotes the probability that an order consists of z demand arrivals withz∈{1,2,…}.We usec=σ/μto denote the coefficient of variation (cv) in any of the above defined variables.In this section, we start with a general introduction on the characterization of an order process by a batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). In Sections 4.1 and 4.2 we illustrate how the order process of an(s,S)and an(r,nQ)inventory policy can be characterized by such a BMAP, when demand follows a compound Poisson process. The characterization of the order process as a BMAP allows us to look at the order process from two distinct perspectives: either we look at the replenishment orders when they are placed, and we analyze the distribution of the time between orders placed and the distribution of the order sizes (Section 5). Or we can look at the number of units that are placed within a certain time interval (Section 6). With these characterizations we can investigate how the batching parameter (value of Q orS-s) amplifies the order variability compared to the observed demand.The batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) is a point process that can characterize orders by batch arrivals of random size. It generalizes the compound Poisson process to non-exponential inter-arrival time distributions between orders and it allows for correlation between order quantities and inter-arrival times between orders (Cordeiro & Kharoufeh, 2011; Lucantoni, 1993). A continuous time BMAP can be characterized as follows (based on Cordeiro & Kharoufeh (2011)): LetJ≡{J(t):t⩾0}be an irreducible, continuous-time Markov chain. Matrix C represents the infinitesimal generator matrix of this Markov chain. If J enters state i, the process will only leave state i after an exponentially distributed amount of time with rateλi(and-λithe ith diagonal element of C). Now, two types of transitions can happen: either no batch order arrives (i.e., the order size k equals zero) and a transition occurs to state j; or an arrival of order size k (k⩾1) occurs, and a transition to state j takes place. Fork⩾0, we can define the matricesCk, whereC0contains the transition rates of J for which no arrivals occur, and the matrices{Ck:k⩾1}contain the transition rates for which an arrival of batch size k occurs. The infinitesimal generator matrix C of this Markov chain is then defined byC=∑k=0∞Ck.Now, letNB(t)denote the total number of arrivals (i.e., the total number of units ordered) up to time t. The joint process(NB,J)≡{(NB(t),J(t)):t⩾0}, is called a batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). The matrices{Ck:k⩾0}are said to form a representation of the BMAP, i.e., the BMAP is completely specified by these matrices.We can now show how the order process of a continuous review(s,S)and(r,nQ)inventory policy can be characterized as a BMAP. When demand follows a compound Poisson process, the inter-arrival time between demands is exponentially distributed. Therefore, if we model the order process as a continuous time BMAP with the states referring to the inventory positions, a transition occurs to another state at every demand arrival. This transition may or may not correspond to placing an order of size k. We can then characterize this order process by the matrices{Ck,k⩾0}, where we think ofC0as managing transitions in inventory positions when no order is placed, andCkas the matrix containing the rate of transitions in inventory positions when an order of size k is placed. Modeling the order process as a BMAP has the advantage that it allows us to compute the variance of the number of units ordered in a time interval t, a characteristic which we will use in Section 6.An(s,S)inventory policy can be characterized by a continuous time Markov chain with the statesj∈{1,…,S-s-1}referring to the inventory positions ranging from S tos+1. We define state j as the modified inventory position which corresponds to the inventory positionS+1-j. Define C as its(S-s)×(S-s)transition probability matrix, with thejthrow referring to an inventory position ofS+1-junits before a demand arrival, and thej′thcolumn referring to an inventory position ofS+1-j′units after a demand arrival. A transition from state j to statej′>joccurs when demand depletes inventory (which implies that the inventory position decreases fromS+1-jtoS+1-j′), its rate(C)j,j′is defined by the demand rateλand the probabilitydj′-jof observing a demand of sizej′-j. As soon as the inventory position reaches the order point s (or less), an order is placed to raise the inventory position to S. A transition from state j (referring to the inventory positionS+1-j) to state 1 (referring to the inventory position S) occurs at rate(C)j,1. Define(Ck)j,1as the transition rate from the modified inventory position j to the modified inventory position 1 while an order of size k is placed, fork∈{S-s,S-s+1,…,S-s+m-1}. Then,Ckcontains the rates of inventory position changes that are accompanied by an order of size k. If an order is placed, the inventory position immediately raises to the order-up-to level S, therefore a transition matrixCS-s+i(when an order of sizeS-s+iis placed) has only non-zero entries in the first column (as this column refers to inventory position S).CS-s+iis not reduced to a vector, erasing the zero entries from the matrix, as also the zero entries provide some information (in this case: placing an order such that the inventory position is raised to an inventory position which differs from S is not possible under this policy). Hence, the transition matrixCS-s+ifori∈{0,…,m-1}, is given by(1)CS-s+i=λdS-s+i0…0dS-s+i-10…0⋮⋮⋮d1+i0…0.Fork∈{1,…,S-s-1},Ck=0, since the order size is always greater than or equal toS-s. LetC0contain the rates of inventory position changes that are not accompanied by an order. Inventory positions decrease due to arriving demand, but the order point s is not reached. Therefore, rates below the diagonal of matrixC0are zero (as inventory positions cannot increase, unless an order is placed),(2)C0=λd0-1d1…dS-s-10⋱⋱⋮⋮⋱d10…d0-1.The order process of an(s,S)policy is then characterized by its(S-s)×(S-s)infinitesimal generator matrix C:(3)C=∑k=0S-s+m-1Ck.Remark that the greatest common divisor of the set{S-s}∪{i|di>0}must be one, otherwise C is not irreducible. If this were not the case, one could divideS-sand all demands by the greatest common divisor. Therefore, this assumption can be made without loss of generality.The vectorα=[αS,αS-1,…,αs+1]defines the steady state probabilities of the inventory positions S tos+1immediately after a replenishment. As one always orders up to S, we haveα=1,0,…,0. The probability to be in a specific inventory position at a random point in time is defined byθ=θS,θS-1,…,θs+1, which is the steady state vector ofC:θis the unique positive solution ofθC=0andθe=1. Note thatθC=0is a set of balance equations. This is a common approach to analyze a Markov model with a “rate-in=rate-out”-type of equations to find long-run equilibrium distributions. We derive expressions forθfor general demand size distributions in Section 5.1.In a similar way, an(r,nQ)inventory policy can be characterized by a continuous time Markov chain with the statej∈{1,…,Q}being the modified inventory position referring to the inventory positionr+Q+1-j. In an(r,nQ)inventory policy, an order is placed as soon as inventory position r or a lower inventory position is reached; a quantity equal to the smallest multiple of Q is ordered such that the inventory position raises above the order point r. We denote itsQ×Qtransition matrix asC^, with thejthrow/column referring to an inventory position ofr+Q+1-junits. A transition from state j to statej′>joccurs when a demand depletes inventory; its rate(C0^)j,j′is equivalent to(C0)j,j′in an(s,S)policy. However, when an order is placed (when state Q or a higher state is reached, which corresponds with an inventory position of at most r), a replenishment is made up to the modified inventory positionj′withj′∈{1,…,Q}, and not up toj′=1like in an(s,S)policy. Define theQ×QmatricesC^kas the matrices containing the rates at which orders of size k are placed withk∈{Q,2Q…,⌈mQ⌉Q}. When inventory positionr-iis reached withi∈{(n-1)Q,…,nQ-1}andn⩾1, one places an order equal to nQ, such that the inventory position raises tor-i+nQ. Therefore,(4)C^nQ=λdnQ…d(n+1)Q-1dnQ-1…d(n+1)Q-2⋮⋱⋮d(n-1)Q+1…dnQ.Fork∈{(n-1)Q+1,…,nQ-1}withn⩾1,C^k=0, since the order size is always a multiple of Q.C^0provides the transition rates at which the inventory position changes without placing an order, and is similar to (2), whereS-s=Q.The order process of the(r,nQ)inventory policy is characterized by itsQ×Qinfinitesimal generator matrixC^:(5)C^=∑k=0mQQC^k.Based on (5), and its elements defined in (2) and (4), we can see thatC^is a circulant matrix with its first row identical to∑n⩾0(dnQ,dnQ+1,…,dnQ+Q-1)-(1,0,…,0), which sums to zero. Remark that the greatest common divisor of the set{Q}∪{i|di>0}must be one, otherwiseC^is not irreducible. If it were larger than one, one could divide Q and all demands by the greatest common divisor. Therefore, this assumption can be made without loss of generality.Letθˆbe the steady state probabilities of the BMAP at a random point in time. In other words,θˆ=[θˆr+Q,θˆr+Q-1,…,θˆr+1]contains the probabilities to be in a specific inventory position at a random point in time, given that an(r,nQ)policy is used. Vectorθˆis the unique positive solution of the balance equationsθˆC^=0andθˆe=1, with0a1×Qzero vector and e aQ×1vector of ones. AsC^is circulant with its row and column sums equal to zero, we find that(6)θˆ=[θˆr+Q,θˆr+Q-1,…,θˆr+1]=1Q[1,…,1],which confirms Simon (1968).When inventory position r (or lower) is reached, a replenishment is made up to a modified inventory positionj′withj′∈{1,…,Q}, and not up toj′=1like in an(s,S)policy. Therefore, the vectorαˆ, which contains the steady state probabilities of the inventory positions immediately after a replenishment, is defined byαˆ=θˆ∑k⩾1C^kθˆ∑k⩾1C^ke=θˆ(C^-C^0)θˆ(C^-C^0)e=θˆC^0/θˆC^0e=eC^0/eC^0e,asθˆC^=0; hence,(7)αˆ=1X1-d0,1-d0-d1,…,1-∑k=0Q-1dk,with(8)X=Q-∑i=0Q-1(Q-i)diBased on the characterization of the order process, we are now in a position to derive some properties. We first define the time between two orders placed.As demand follows a compound Poisson process, the time between demand arrivals follows an exponential distribution. The distribution of the time between orders is defined in the following proposition:Proposition 1When demand follows a compound Poisson demand process, the time between orders placed in an(s,S)policy is phase-type distributed, characterized by the triple(S-s,C0,α), withC0an(S-s)×(S-s)substochastic matrix, defined by(2); andα=[1,0,…,0]. The average and the variance of the time between subsequent orders equal:(9)μot=1λ∑j=0S-s-1bS-j,(10)σot2=1λ22∑j=0S-s-1bS-j∑i=0S-s-1-jbS-i-∑j=0S-s-1bS-j2,withbS-jdefined by the recursive equation(11)bS-j=11-d0forj=0,bS∑i=1jdi·bS-j+iforj∈{1,…,S-s-1}.In an(s,S)policy the time between two orders placed is equivalent to the time it takes for the Markov chain to move from the order-up-to level S until absorption in the order point s or below. Since the time between successive transitions in a continuous time Markov chain is exponentially distributed, the distribution of the time until absorption to s is the sum of a random number of exponentially distributed time intervals, and thus follows a phase-type (PH) distribution. The number of phases is equivalent to the number of inventory positions before placing an order, which equalsS-s. As we always order up to S, the initial vectorα=[1,0,…,0].C0contains the transition rates between the transient states ranging from S tos+1(and is defined by (2)).The expected time spent in each inventory position before placing an order is given by the vectorα(-C0)-1(Latouche & Ramaswami, 1999), where the matrix(-C0)is an(S-s)×(S-s)upper triangular Toeplitz matrix. The inverse of(-C0)is again an upper triangular Toeplitz matrix, defined as(-C0)-1=1λbSbS-1bS-2⋯bs+10bSbS-1⋯bs+200bS⋱⋮000⋱bS-1000⋱bS,with1λbS-jthe expected time spent in inventory positionS-jforj∈{0,…,S-s-1}. The entriesbS-jof(-C0)-1represent the expected number of times inventory positionS-jis visited before replenishment, and can be found as follows (based on Richards (1975)): as one always orders up toS,bS=1ifd0=0, and11-d0ifd0⩾0.bS-1is then determined bybSand the probability that a demand occurs with size 1. Using backward substitution, we obtain (11).Using the definition of the mean and the variance of a phase-type distribution (i.e.,μ=α-C0-1eandσ2=2αC0-2e-αC0-1e2, with e anS-s×1unit vector (Latouche & Ramaswami, 1999)), we find (9) and (10).□Due to the interpretation of1λbS-j(or equivalently, by means ofθ=α(-C0)-1/(α(-C0)-1e)), we find that(12)θ=(bS,bS-1,…,bs+1)∑i=s+1Sbi.For some simple demand size distributions, we can obtain a closed-form expression forbS-j. In Appendix A we provide closed-form results when demand sizes have a truncated Poisson, uniform, or delayed geometric distribution. In case of single unit demands (i.e.,m=1), the time between orders follows an Erlang distribution∼Erlang(S-s,λ)withμot=(S-s)/λandσot2=(S-s)/λ2.From Proposition 1, we see that the average time between two subsequent orders is equal to the sum of the average time spent in all inventory positionsS-jprior to the order point s, which are given by1λbS-j, withj∈{0,…,S-s-1}. As allbS-jare positive andbS⩾1(asbS=11-d0), we find thatμot⩾1λ. Or, in other words, the average time between two orders is larger than or equal to the average time between two demand arrivals, i.e.μot⩾μdt.In a similar way, Proposition 2 characterizes the time between orders for an(r,nQ)policy.Proposition 2When demand follows a compound Poisson demand process, the time between orders placed in an(r,nQ)policy is phase-type distributed, characterized by the triple(Q,C^0,αˆ), withC^0aQ×Qsubstochastic matrix, defined by(2), andαˆdefined by(7). The average and the variance of time between subsequent orders equal:(13)μˆot=QλX,(14)σˆot2=1λ2X2∑i=0Q-11-∑j=0idj∑k=0Q-1-ibS-k∑l=0Q-1-i-kbS-l-Q2X,withbS-jas defined in Eq.(11).The proof is analogous to Proposition 1, withs=randQ=S-r. In an(r,nQ)policy the time between two orders placed is equivalent to the time it takes for the Markov chain until absorption in the order point r or below.C^0describes how the inventory position decreases prior to reaching one of the absorbing states, and the steady state probabilitiesαˆof the inventory positions immediately after a replenishment are given by (7). AsC^0=C0, the expressions forbS-jare equivalent to (11), although its intuitive interpretation does not longer hold in an(r,nQ)policy.Using the definition of the mean and the variance of a phase-type distribution, we find (13) and (14) withμˆot=1λX∑i=0Q-11-∑j=0idj∑k=0Q-1-ibS-k. Through induction, we show that this expression can be reduced to(15)1λX∑i=0Q-11-∑j=0idj∑k=0Q-1-ibS-k=QλX.ForQ=1, Eq. (15) holds as1-d0bS=1. Given that Eq. (15) holds forQ=x, we want to prove that it also holds forQ=x+1. This would be the case if:(16)∑i=0x-11-∑j=0idj∑k=0x-ibS-k+1-∑j=0xdjbS=x+1∑i=0x-11-∑j=0idj∑k=0x-1-ibS-k+bS-(x-i)+1-∑j=0xdjbS=x+1∑i=0x-11-∑j=0idjbS-(x-i)+1-∑j=0xdjbS=1∑i=0x1-∑j=0idjbS-(x-i)=1,which is also proven through induction. Forx=0, Eq. (16) holds as(1-d0)bS=1. Given that Eq. (16) holds forx=y, we prove that it holds forx=y+1, as∑i=0y+11-∑j=0idjbS-(y+1-i)=∑i=0y1-∑j=0idjbS-(y-i),which can be reduced tobS-(y+1)=11-d0∑j=1y+1djbS-(y+1)+j, which holds according to Eq. (11). □Proposition 2 implies that, also in an(r,nQ)policy, we have that the average time between two subsequent orders is larger than or equal to the average time between two demand arrivals, i.e.μˆot⩾μdt.As we are in particular interested in the order variance amplification, created by an(s,S)and(r,nQ)policy, we derive the following Proposition:Proposition 3Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(s,S)or an(r,nQ)inventory policy, the variance of the time between subsequent orders is larger than or equal to the variance of time between subsequent demand arrivals, i.e.,σot2⩾σdt2and, respectively,σˆot2⩾σdt2.The proof is given for the(s,S)policy, but is identical for the(r,nQ)policy. As demand follows a compound Poisson process, the time between demand arrivals is exponentially distributed andσdt2=1/λ2. Therefore, we need to show thatσot2⩾1/λ2. In fact we will prove thatσot2⩾μot/λ, which is a somewhat stronger result asμot⩾1/λ. Letpzbe the probability that an order consists of z demands (where some demands may be of size zero ifd0>0). Provided that an order consists of z demands, the inter-arrival time follows an Erlang-z distribution. As the second moment of an Erlang-z distribution equals(z+z2)/λ2, we can writeσot2as(17)σot2=∑z⩾1pzz+z2λ2-∑z⩾1pzzλ2=μotλ+∑z⩾1pzz2λ2-∑z⩾1pz∑i⩾1piziλ2,sinceμot=∑z⩾1pzzλ. Further,zi⩽(z2+i2)/2as(z-i)2⩾0, which yieldsσot2⩾μotλ+∑z⩾1pzz2λ2-∑z⩾1pz∑i⩾1piz2+i22λ2=μotλ+∑z⩾1pzz2λ2-∑z⩾1pz∑i⩾1pi︸=1z22λ2-∑z⩾1pz︸=1∑i⩾1pii22λ2=μotλ+∑z⩾1pzz2λ2-12∑z⩾1pzz2λ2-12∑i⩾1pii2λ2=μotλ,which completes the proof.□Interestingly, looking at the time between orders placed, we find that its variance is amplified compared to the demand process, but its relative variance, as defined by its coefficient of variation, is actually dampened compared to the demand process. This result follows from Proposition 1.Corollary 1Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(s,S)inventory policy, the coefficient of variation (cv) of time between subsequent orders is smaller than or equal to the cv of time between subsequent demand arrivals, i.e.,cot⩽cdt.As demand arrives according to a compound Poisson process, it follows thatcdt=1. Hence, to prove Corollary 1, we need to show thatσot⩽μot. Substituting Eqs. (9) and (10), we need to show that1λ2∑j=0S-s-1bS-j∑i=0S-s-1-jbS-i-∑j=0S-s-1bS-j2⩽1λ∑j=0S-s-1bS-j,or by rewriting,∑j=0S-s-1bS-j∑i=0S-s-1-jbS-i-∑i=0S-s-1bS-i⩽0.As allbiare positive, we know that∑i=0S-s-1-jbS-i⩽∑j=0S-s-1bS-j, which proves Corollary 1.□We conjecture that this result also holds for an(r,nQ)policy. It can be proven forQ⩽2(asc^ot=1forQ=1andcˆot=1-d122(1-d0)2forQ=2), and in caseQ+1⩽2Qμdk. This leads to the following Proposition.Proposition 4Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(r,nQ)inventory policy, ifQ+1⩽2Qμdk, the coefficient of variation (cv) of time between subsequent orders is smaller than or equal to the cv of time between subsequent demand arrivals, i.e.,cˆot⩽cdt.Ascdt=1, it suffices to show thatσˆot2-μˆot2⩽0, which can be expressed as(18)∑z⩾1pzzλ2(1+z)-2∑i⩾1pii⩽0,due to (17), wherepzdenotes the probability that an order consists of z demands. Thus, it suffices to show that(1+z)⩽2∑i⩾1piifor all z for whichpz>0.∑i⩾1piirepresents the average number of demand arrivals prior to placing an order, which equalsλμˆot=QX, according to (13). Thus, in order to prove thatcˆot⩽cdt, it is sufficient to show that(1+z)⩽2QXfor all z for whichpz>0.Under an(r,nQ)policy and a compound Poisson demand process, with demand sizes ranging from 1 to m, we havez⩽Q, as an order will have been placed after Q demand arrivals.X is defined by Eq. (8) asX=Q-∑i=0Q-1Q-idi, which leads toX=μdkifm<Q, andX=μdk-∑i=0m-QidQ+iifm⩾Q. Hence we know thatX⩽μdk.Fromz⩽QandX⩽μdk, we know that1+z⩽1+Qand2Qμdk⩽2QX. Therefore, if1+Q⩽2Qμdk, we can show that1+z⩽2∑i⩾1pii, which proves Proposition 4.□The difficulty in proving this result for any value of Q andμdkexists in showing (18), which does not hold for any (general) set of probabilitiespz. However, we conjecture that it does hold for any set of probabilitiespzin an(r,nQ)policy under compound Poisson demand (as is also confirmed by numerical experiments).Besides the time between two orders placed, we now investigate the size of the order quantities.Proposition 5Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(s,S)inventory policy, the probability to order quantity i (withi∈{1,…,S-s+m-1}) is defined as(19)π(i)=0fori∈{1,…,S-s-1},∑j=0S-s-1di-jbS-j∑i=S-sS-s+m-1∑j=0S-s-1di-jbS-jfori∈{S-s,…,S-s+m-1},withbS-jas defined in(11).First, note that when demand is finite with maximum m, an(s,S)policy generates order quantitiesi∈{S-s,…,S-s+m-1}. The probability to place an order with size i is equal to the probability that the inventory position reachesS-i. This probability is given by the sum for all j (ranging from 0 toS-s-1) of the probabilities of being in inventory positionS-jand a demand of sizei-jrealizes. Therefore, the probability to order a quantity i equalsπ(i)=θCieθ∑i⩾S-sCie=θCie/(θ(-C0)e),withθdefined by (12). Substituting (2) and (1) leads to Proposition 5.□The expected order quantity is larger than or equal to the expected demand size, i.e.μok⩾μdk. Indeed, as the average order rate must equal the average demand rate in order to have a stable system,μok1μot=μdk1μdt, we find thatμok⩾μdk, as we have previously shown thatμot⩾μdt.If we want to analyze the variance in order quantities, we can do so using its definition:(20)σok2=∑i⩾S-sS-s+m-1(i)2·π(i)-∑i⩾S-sS-s+m-1(i)·π(i)2.The above confirms that in case of only single-unit demands (i.e.,m=1), there is no overshoot, and Eqs. (19) and (20) reduce toπ(S-s)=1andσok2=0. We always order a fixed order quantity equal toS-s.In a similar way, the distribution of order quantities of an(r,nQ)inventory policy can be derived.Proposition 6Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(r,nQ)inventory policy, the probability to order quantity i (withi∈{1,2,…}) is defined as:(21)πˆ(i)=0fori∉{Q,2Q,…}1X∑j=-(Q-1)Q-1(Q-|j|)di+jfori∈{Q,2Q,…}withX=Q-∑i=0Q-1(Q-i)di.The order quantity is the smallest multiple of Q such that the inventory position is at leastr+1. Therefore, we know thatπˆ(Q)=θˆC^Qeθˆ∑i⩾QC^ie.In general, fork⩾Q,πˆ(k)=θˆC^keθˆ∑i⩾QC^ie=eC^kee∑i⩾QC^ie=eC^kee(-C^0)e,asθˆ=1Q1,…,1. Substituting (2) and (4) in the above leads to Proposition 6. □Based on Proposition 6, one can show that ifm⩽Q, thenπˆ(Q)=1andσˆok2=0. Analogous to the(s,S)policy, we also find thatμˆok⩾μdk.Next to characterizing the order process from the perspective of the time between orders and the size of the orders placed, we can also look at the total number of units ordered in an arbitrary interval of length t. This can be useful when the upstream supplier reviews its orders on a periodic basis of interval t and as such aggregates the number of units that are ordered during this time interval. We compare the variance of the total number of units ordered in a time interval t with the variance of the number of units demanded in the same interval. This ratio is commonly used in the literature as a measure of the bullwhip effect. This ratio differs depending on the length of the interval t: the longer the interval t, the more the order and demand variances will flatten out and concur.Recall thatM(t)andN(t)denote the number of demand arrivals and the number of orders placed in an arbitrary interval of length t, andMB(t)andNB(t)the number of units demanded, resp. ordered in the interval t. Then, the order variance amplification as a function of the interval t, is defined as(22)Var[NB(t)]Var[MB(t)]=Var∑i=1N(t)OiVar∑i=1M(t)Di,withDithe size of the ith demand in such an interval andOithe size of the ith order, and can be quantified using the following Proposition.Proposition 7Given a compound Poisson demand process and a continuous review(s,S)or(r,nQ)policy, the variance of the number of units ordered in interval t is given by(23)Var[NB(t)]=[λ2-2(λ∗)2+2cC1∗e]t-2c[I-eCt]g,and the variance of the number of units demanded in interval t is(24)Var[MB(t)]=E[M(t)]σdk2+μdk2Var[M(t)]=λt[σdk2+μdk2]withλ2=θC2∗e,λ∗=θC1∗e,c=θC1∗(eθ-C)-1,g=(eθ-C)-1C1∗e,Ck∗=∑i⩾1ikCi, fork=1,2,Ithe identity matrix, and C as defined in Eq.(3). Note that this expression is valid for the(s,S)policy, but also for the(r,nQ)policy provided that we replaceCibyC^ifor alli,CbyC^andθbyθˆ.The formula forVar[MB(t)]is straightforward, as demand sizes are independent of the time between demand arrivals, andE[M(t)]=Var[M(t)]=λtfor a compound Poisson demand process. The order sizesOiare, however, not independent of the time between orders placed, meaning thatN(t)is not independent ofOi. To computeVar[NB(t)]we therefore rely on the fact that the order process is a BMAP that is characterized by a set of matricesCi, fori⩾0. The expression for the variance of the counting processNB(t)of a stationary BMAP1A stationary BMAP is a BMAP with the additional assumption that the state at time zero is distributed asθwithθC=0. Since, we are interested in the number of orders placed in an arbitrary interval of length t, the BMAP of interest is in fact the stationary BMAP.1was shown by Neuts and Li (1996).For the(r,nQ)-policy we can also derive a different expression forVar[NB(t)].Proposition 8Given a compound Poisson demand process and an(r,nQ)inventory policy, we haveVar[NB(t)]=Var[MB(t)]+E[NB,Q(t)(Q-NB,Q(t))],withVar[MB(t)]=λt[σdk2+μdk2], as defined in(24), andNB,Q(t)=(NB(t)modQ), i.e.,NB,Q(t)is the number of units demanded modulo Q in an arbitrary interval of length t.This property is proven in a manner similar to Proposition 4.3 in Caplin (1985, p. 103). AsE[NB(t)]=E[MB(t)]=λtμdk, we haveVar[NB(t)]-Var[MB(t)]=∑a=0∞∑b=0Q-1E[NB2(t)|MB(t)=aQ+b]-(aQ+b)2Pr[MB(t)=aQ+b].DenoteI(t)the inventory position at the start of the interval of length t, i.e.,Pr[I(t)=p]=θˆi=1/Q. Then, forMB(t)=aQ+bandI(t)=p, we haveNB(t)=(a+1)Qifp=s+1,…,s+bandNB(t)=aQforp>s+bunder the(r,nQ)-policy. As a result,ENB2(t)|MB(t)=aQ+b=∑p=s+1SENB2(t)|MB(t)=aQ+b,I(t)=pPr[I(t)=p],=bQ((a+1)Q)2+Q-bQ(aQ)2=(aQ+b)2-b2+Qb.This impliesVar[NB(t)]-Var[MB(t)]=∑a=0∞∑b=0Q-1b(Q-b)Pr[MB(t)=aQ+b],which completes the proof.□It is worthwhile to note that Proposition 8 confirms the results of Caplin (1985), who studies a continuous review(s,S)policy with single unit demand, and the results of Li and Sridharan (2008) and Chen and Lee (2012), who obtained similar conclusions for the periodic review(r,nQ)policy.Although it may be more effective to computeVar[NB(t)]via Eq. (23), Proposition 8 is particularly useful as it allows us to prove the following corollary:Corollary 2When demand has a compound Poisson distribution and an(r,nQ)inventory policy is in use, we haveVar[NB(t)]⩾Var[MB(t)], andlimt→∞Var[NB(t)]=Var[MB(t)]. Further,Var[NB(t)]Var[MB(t)]=λσdk2+μdk2t-2c[I-eC^t]g,andlimt→∞Var[NB(t)]-Var[MB(t)]=2cg-2(λ∗)2.Proposition 8 and (24) implyVar[NB(t)]Var[MB(t)]=1+E[NB,Q(t)(Q-NB,Q(t))]λtσdk2+μdk2.As0⩽NB,Q(t)⩽Q-1, we findVar[NB(t)]⩾Var[MB(t)]andVar[NB(t)]Var[MB(t)]⩽1+Q2λtσdk2+μdk2→1,ast→∞.Note,Var[NB(t)]=Var[MB(t)]if and only if all the demand sizes are multiples of Q. By noting thateC^tconverges toeθˆand thatce=λ∗=θˆg, we getlimt→∞2ceC^tg=2(λ∗)2.When combined with (23) and the fact thatlimt→∞Var[NB(t)]=Var[MB(t)], this proves thatλ2-2(λ∗)2+2cC^1∗e=λ[σdk2+μdk2],and this suffices to conclude thatlimt→∞Var[NB(t)]-Var[MB(t)]=limt→∞2c(I-eC^t)g.□Also this result is in line with the existing literature, albeit in different settings, showing that order batching leads to variance amplification (e.g., Chen & Lee, 2012; Li & Sridharan, 2008; Schultz, 1983). Although the impact of the time interval t on the bullwhip ratio seems intuitive, its is worthwhile to quantify it explicitly.Remark that, in case of single unit demand sizes (m=1), the(r,nQ)and(s,S)policy behave identical and the above results therefore also apply for the(s,S)policy ifm=1. We conjecture that Corollary 2 also holds for an(s,S)policy for any value ofm>1(if we replaceC^by C) and numerical experiments seem to confirm this. The main difficulty in proving this lies in the fact that the amount ordered in an interval of length t is not uniquely determined by the initial inventory position and the total demand in such an interval (as is the case for an(r,nQ)policy). Instead, the amount ordered depends on the size of the individual demands, which makes an analysis as in Proposition 8 intractable.In this section we numerically illustrate the impact of the batching effect, induced by an(s,S)or an(r,nQ)inventory policy, on its order process variability. We use a setting where demand is characterized by a compound Poisson process, with arrival rateλ=1and demand sizes according to resp. a discrete uniform (D∼U{1,…,19}), a truncated Poisson (D∼Pois{10}withm=1000) and a delayed geometric distribution (D∼Geo{0.1}withm=1000), each withμdk=10(the motivation behind the delayed geometric distribution is inspired by Johnston, Boylan, & Shale (2003), who give empirical evidence that this distribution is often observed for the demand sizes).With this numerical illustration, we basically want to show how the choice of the batch size impacts the order dynamics and can lead for example to undesirable variance amplification. As the order process determines the upstream supplier’s inventory requirements or production process, the upstream supplier might want to manipulate his customer’s ordering behavior. For instance, by slightly adjusting the fixed order cost that he charges to his customer, the batch size will be impacted and thus the corresponding order process variability. Our analysis helps to gain insight into the impact of the batch size on the order process.In order to understand some of the dynamics, we derived closed-form expressions for some special cases in Appendix B. More specifically, when the demand size is uniform or delayed geometric distributed, Appendix B provides expressions for the average and the variance of the time between orders and the order sizes for the(s,S)policy. Expressions for the(r,nQ)policy can be derived in an analogous way. When the demand size is Poisson distributed, the closed-form expressions are too complex to gain insight.Fig. 2plots the ratio of the average order size compared to the average demand size as a function of the batching parameterS-sor Q, for both the(s,S)and(r,nQ)policy. Note that this ratio coincides with the ratio of the average time between orders to the average time between demand arrivals, as in order to have a stable system, the average rate of units ordered must equal the average rate of units demanded, orμok/μot=μdk/μdt, which leads toμot/μdt=μok/μdk. From Fig. 2 we see that these ratios increase with the batching parameter, but not always in a linear way. For an(r,nQ)policy, we do have a linear increase in Q forQ⩾m, as in that case we always order Q units. Observe as well that the average order sizeμokand its corresponding time between ordersμotare larger for an(s,S)policy compared toμˆokandμˆotfor an(r,nQ)policy. This is intuitive as one always orders up to S in an(s,S)policy, whereas in an(r,nQ)policy one orders at most up tor+Q. Furthermore, we also observe a change in slope for the setting with discrete uniform demand sizes and an(s,S)inventory policy whenS-s=m+1. We quantified this change in slope in Appendix B (Eqs. (27) and (28)). In Appendix B we also quantify the linear increase inμokfor a geometric demand size and an(s,S)policy.Fig. 3(a) illustrates the variance amplification ratio of the time between orders placed compared to the time between demand arrivals. Here, we observe that we always have variance amplification, which increases inS-sor Q, albeit not always linearly (recall that for a single unit demand process, the increase is linear in Q; also for a geometric distribution of demand sizes and an(s,S)policy, we show in Appendix B that the increase is linear inS-s). We can also quantify the change in slope atS-s=m+1for a uniform demand size distribution and an(s,S)policy. We observe a higher variance amplification in the time between orders placed in an(s,S)policy, compared to the(r,nQ)policy.Fig. 3(b) provides the ratio of the coefficient of variation of the time between orders placed to the time between demand arrivals (which equals 1 for a compound Poisson demand). It shows that the relative variance of the time between orders is actually less than the relative variance of the time between demands, indicating that we have variance dampening (smoothing) in the time between orders. For the(s,S)policy with discrete uniform demand sizes, we observe the same change in slope fromS=m+1onwards.Fig. 4(a) shows the ratio of the variance of order sizes compared to the variance of demand sizes as a function ofS-sor Q. Here we do not always see variance amplification. For some values of Q, we may observe variance amplification, but we find as well order variance smoothing. Observe that the variance of the order sizes converges to a limiting value in an(s,S)policy, which can either indicate bullwhip or smoothing. Appendix B quantifies that for uniform distributed demand sizes and an(s,S)policy, we observe that an increase ofS-sfirst causes a decrease inσok2, but fromS-s=10toS-s=18an increase is perceived. Formulas for the slope can be found in Appendix B. For an(r,nQ)policy, the variance of the order sizes is zero whenQ⩾m: as demand sizes cannot be larger than Q, it is not possible that an order quantity exceeds Q.If we look at the ratio of the cv of order sizes compared to the cv of demand sizes (Fig. 4(b)), we can make the same observation, but we see that we primarily have smoothing in the order sizes. This indicates that the relative variance of the order sizes is smaller than the relative variance of the demand sizes. Although this ratio generally goes down whenS-sor Q increases, this decrease is not strict inS-sor Q.We finally illustrate the order variance amplification ratio of the order process, looking at the number of units ordered in a time interval t, compared to the number of units demanded in that same time interval (in Fig. 5(a) we havet=1, whereas in Fig. 5(b),t=60). We find variance amplification in orders, which is generally increasing inS-sor Q, albeit not always linearly and not always strict increasing inS-sor Q (for some values ofS-sor Q, we even observe a slight decrease of the bullwhip effect in the batching parameter), and see how aggregating data over longer time periods reduces the magnitude of the bullwhip effect (as also indicated by Chen & Lee (2012)). We also confirm the results – albeit in a different setting – of Caplin (1985) and Potter and Disney (2006), who state that for large batch sizes, the ratio increases linearly in the batch size, whereas for small batch sizes the linear relationship does not hold and local minima can occur. For most instances, we observe a stronger variance amplification ratio for the(s,S)policy, compared to the(r,nQ)policy. However, for example, for Poisson distributed demand sizes andS-sandQ<6, the opposite is true.In Fig. 6, we compare the magnitude of the bullwhip effect of the order process in a continuous review setting and in a periodic review setting. The variance amplification ratio of orders in the periodic review setting is computed based on the formula of Schneider et al. (1995). We plotted both our results for the order variance amplification ratio in a continuous review(s,S)policy (assuming a time intervalt=1), and the order amplification ratio in a periodic review(s,S)policy (assuming that the review period equals one time unit) as a function of the value ofS-s. We observe in Fig. 6 a stronger bullwhip ratio in a periodic review setting than in a continuous review setting.In Fig. 7we make a connection with Caplin (1985), as this figure illustrates how the time interval t impacts the bullwhip ratio when single unit demand sizes are assumed (m=1). For small intervals t, we see an increase as a function ofS-s, but this is not necessarily the case for large time intervals t and small values ofS-s. Recall that Caplin (1985), assuming single unit demands, finds a linear increase when the time interval is chosen such that eitherS-sor 0 units are ordered; indeed, this assumption is more likely to hold if the batch sizeS-sis larger than the time interval t. This linear increase is observed in Fig. 7 whenS-s⩾t, but the bullwhip ratio does not increase linearly inS-swhenS-s<t. In this case, Caplin (1985) shows that the magnitude of the bullwhip ratio depends on the extent to which demand concentrates around multiples ofS-s. Also Potter and Disney (2006) observed the same effects.This numerical study illustrates how the value of the batching parameter impacts the variability in the order process. An upstream supplier may want to manipulate the variance of the orders he receives by carefully selecting the fixed order cost that he imposes to his customer. Depending on whether he is interested in minimizing the variability of order quantities, time between orders, or the number of units ordered in a time interval t, the upstream supplier prefers a different batch size. Our analysis helps to give guidance on this.
