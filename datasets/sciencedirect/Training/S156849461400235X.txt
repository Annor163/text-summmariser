@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Mechanical and physical properties of sandstone are interesting scientifically and have great practical significance as well as their relations to the mineralogy and pore features. These relations are however highly nonlinear and cannot be easily formulated by conventional methods. This paper investigates the potential of the technique named as the relevance vector machine (RVM) for prediction of the elastic compressibility of sandstone based on its characteristics of physical properties. Based on the fact that the hyper-parameters may have effects on the RVM performance, an iteration method is proposed in this paper to search for optimal hyper-parameter value so that it can produce best predictions. Also, the qualitative sensitivity of the physical properties is investigated by the backward regression analysis. Meanwhile, the hyper-parameter effect of the RVM approach is discussed in the prediction of the elastic compressibility of sandstone. The predicted results of the RVM demonstrate that hyper-parameter values have evident effects on the RVM performance. Comparisons on the results of the RVM, the artificial neural network and the support vector machine prove that the proposed strategy is feasible and reliable for prediction of the elastic compressibility of sandstone based on its physical properties.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The mechanical and physical properties of sandstone are fascinating scientifically and have great practical significance as well as their relations to its microstructural characteristics [1–4]. These relations between the mechanical parameters and physical properties are however highly nonlinear and cannot be easily formulated by conventional methods. Sandstone is a typical kind of porous media composed of solid particles and pore spaces. Solid particles form the skeleton of sandstone and are surrounded by the pore spaces. The solid particles consist of various kinds of minerals, such as the quartz, the feldspar and the detrital clay. Three types of pores are often measured by the laboratory experiments: (i) the intergranular pore, (ii) the connective pore and (iii) the micro pore. The mechanical behaviours of sandstones are closely related to the physical properties such as the mineral composition and pore properties. The compositions of solid particles and pores of sandstone primarily result in its varying mechanical behaviours. Hence, mechanical behaviours of sandstones may be estimated according to the characteristics of the mineral compositions and the pore features.Elastic compressibility is a common mechanical parameter of such porous media like the sandstone. Recently, the elastic compressibility of different materials has been studied by various kinds of techniques [5–8]. The physical properties of sandstone have been tested in the laboratory to investigate their relationship with microstructural features and loading pressures [9]. Substantial experiments have been done to identify the mechanical parameters such as the elastic compressibility. The obtained relationships between the elastic compressibility and the previous maximum pressure show that the elastic compressibility at any given pressure is a function of the previous stress history of the sample [10]. However no specific method has been presented to account for these relations. Thus the estimation of the elastic compressibility is difficult based on the loading pressures. Substantial discussions have been made on the compressibility of sandstones including the stress and the compressibility, the pore structure and the compressibility and the laboratory measurements of the compressibility [7]. Also, methods are presented with permission of quantitative predictions of the sandstone compressibility. Some work on prediction of the rock compressibility behaviours has been undertaken using the neural networks and support vector machine based on rock physical properties [11,12]. Some experiments have been done to discover the fractal characteristics of the pore structure of the low permeability sandstone [13]. A pore structure model is applied to predict the elastic wave velocities in fluid-saturated sandstones [14]. These results show that pore structures do influence the characteristics of sandstones. Hence, the effects of the mineral compositions as well as the microstructure features should be considered for the estimation of the elastic compressibility.It is sometimes expensive to measure certain mechanical features of porous materials. Recently, the soft computing techniques including the neural network, the support vector machine [15], the cloud models [16], and the Gaussian process [17] have been incorporated into rock mechanics and engineering to discover the mechanical behaviours of rocks [18–24] as well as the associated hazards [25–30]. In this study, we focus on the estimation of the elastic compressibility of sandstone according to its characteristics of the mineral compositions and the pore structures as well as the loading pressure using the state-of-art soft computing technique named as the relevance vector machine (RVM) [31]. The RVM is a probabilistic approach for learning disciplines in data. The hyper-parameters influence the modelling performance of RVMs [32]. The application of the RVM has been presented in the slope reliable analysis [33]. However, the effect of the hyper parameter has not been discovered yet and usually given manually.In this paper, we present an iterative strategy to optimize the RVM hyper-parameters adaptively and then apply this approach to estimate the elastic compressibility of sandstones. We aim to: (1) show the qualitative sensitivity of the factors to the elastic compressibility of sandstones; (2) show the effects of hyper-parameters of RVM in the estimation of the elastic compressibility of sandstones; (3) investigate the potential capability of the adaptive RVM in the estimation of the elastic compressibility of sandstone according to its characteristics of properties like the mineral composition and the pore features. The specific mechanical effects of the minerals or the pore structure are not included in this study.The RVM is proposed in the Bayesian framework with probabilistic significance [31]. It produces a mapping between the target variables and the associated independent variables, i.e.(1)y=f(x;w)=∑i=1NwiK(x,xi)+w0=wtϕ(x)where N is the total sample number; i is the ith sample number;y=f(x;w)is the mapping; x, xidenote the associated independent variables; K(x, xi) is the kernel functions; ϕ(x)=[1, K(x, x1), K(x, x2), …, K(x, xn)]t; wiis the weight of ith sample,w=[w0,w1,…,wN]t.In regression, the RVM employs Eq. (1) with an additive noise term to link the input xnand scalar target variable tn(2)tn=f(xn;w)+∈nwhere ∈nis a zero-mean white noise process with variance σ2, that is p(∈n|σ2)=N(∈n|0, σ2).Posing β=σ2, and assuming independence of the samples, the likelihood of the training samples is(3)p(t|X,w,β)=(2πβ−1)−N/2exp−12βt−ϕw2where t=[t1, …, tN]t,X=Xnn=1N. With more parameters (N+1) than training data samples (N), direct maximum-likelihood estimation of w would lead to over-fitting. In the RVM Bayesian framework, zero-mean Gaussian shrinkage priors are imposed on every wiand, assuming the independence of the parameters, one can have(4)p(wi|αi)=N(wi|0,αi−1)⇒p(w|α)=Πi=0NN(wi|0,αi−1)with α=[α0, α1, …, αN]t, a N+1 vector of hyper-parameters representing the precision on the parameters.Finally uniform hyper-priors are assumed for the precision hyper-parameters, α and β. An interesting property of these hyper-priors is that when the evidence of the model is maximized with respect to the hyper-parameters the corresponding parameters turn to be zero. This is a type of “automatic relevance determination” [34] leading to a sparse set of parameters w. Using Bayes rule and the properties of Gaussian functions, the posterior distribution of the weight can also be described by a Gaussian:(5)p(w|X,t,α,β)=N(w|m,Σ)where the mean m and the covariance Σ are given by(6)m=βΣΦtt;Σ=(A+βΦtΦ)−1with A=diag(α0, …, αN) a diagonal matrix of precisions.In practice, the values of α and β are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood p(t|X, α, β), i.e., using a type-II maximum-likelihood method [35]. Only the most probable values are thus calculated, which is an approximation to estimate their full distribution. With this simplification, the marginal likelihood can be obtained by integrating over the weight parameters(7)p(t|X,α,β)=∫p(t|X,w,β)p(w|α)dw=N(t|0,β−1I+ΦA−1Φt)Values of α and β that maximizes (the log of) Eq. (7) can then be obtained iteratively using the following updating rules(8)αinew=1−αiΣiimi2;(βnew)−1=t−Φm2N−∑i−1N(1−αiΣii)where miis the ith element of the estimated posterior weight w and Σiithe ith diagonal element of the posterior covariance matrix Σ from Eq. (6).Once the iterative procedure has converged to the “most probable values αMPand βMP, the distribution of target value t* for a new data point x* is also Gaussian and estimated by(9)p(t∗|X,t,αMP,βMP)=∫p(t∗|X,w,βMP)p(w|X,t,αMP,βMP)dw=N(t∗|mtφ(x∗),σ∗2)(10)σ∗2=βMP−1+φ(x∗)tΣφ(x∗)where Σ is given by Eq. (6) with α and β set at their optimal value.Unlike the optimization of the weight w, the hyper-parameter r2 is user-defined before model training. In order to optimize the hyper-parameter value, the target function (TF) should be defined first. The adaption of the kernel parameters goes in the following steps:(a)Initialize the hyper-parameter r2 in a proper range and specify the initialr02and an appropriate step for iteration;Specify one kernel function;Train the RVM model with the data set to obtain an optimal αMPand the weight w;Compute the posterior distribution outputP(t|X,w);Calculate the TF value;Update hyper-parameterrk+12=rk2+steplooping into (b) tillrk+12=max(r2);Find out the maximum TF value for each kernel function and the corresponding r2 value as the optimal hyper-parameter.With the above steps, the predicted outputs are obtained as well as the optimal r2 value.The dataset is obtained from the experiments of measuring physical properties of sandstones. Such properties of the sandstone like the mineral composition (in volume), the bulk density and the pore features are measured as well as the elastic compressibility values. The samples used in the experiment are mostly clean quartz arenites, subarkoses and argillaceous quartz arenites, in which kaolinite is the dominant pore-filling mineral [9]. As stated by Caruso et al. [9], three types of pores are distinguished on the basis of size, shape and relation to other pores: intergranular, connective, and micro. Their volume percentage are obtained by the point counting SEM images and a modified point counting technique which can count directly the intergranular and connective pores. The intergranular pores are relatively large, irregularly shaped and roughly equidimensional. The connective pores are smaller and often narrower than the intergranular pores and have at least one dimension much smaller than the other dimensions. They extend between intergranular pores. Micro pores are the pores with dimensions equal to, or less than, a few microns. The micropores occur within aggregates of clay. The total porosity is about 5–31% of the whole sample in volume; the intergranular porosity is in the range 24–76% of the total porosity; the connective porosity is within 4–25% of the total porosity; and the micro porosity, 10–63% of total porosity.In total, 37 sandstone samples are collected and each sample has 11 physical properties. The statistical features of the dataset are given in Table 1where aA, aBand aCare the elastic compressibility coefficients measured by gauges settled in three orthogonal directions. In order to demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed ARVM strategy, 30 samples are used to train the models to obtain optimal model parameter and thus establish the ARVM prediction model. The RVM model is trained with 30 sandstone samples by the strategy in methodology: adaptive relevance vector machine section to establish an optimized RVM prediction model for estimation of the elastic compressibility based on the physical properties. Then the optimized model is utilized to give estimation of the elastic compressibility of the other 7 testing samples in Table 2which are not involved in the model training. In this way, the predictability of the models can be verified by the predictions on the left 7 testing samples.The Gaussian kernel is used in the modelling. The absolute percentage error (APE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), as well as the standard error of estimation (SEE), are defined as the TF to evaluate the model performance on the estimation of the elastic compressibility of sandstone samples(11)APE=∑i=1nYi−Yi*Yi×100%MAPE=1n∑i=1nYi−Yi*Yi×100%SEE=∑(Yi−Yi*)2nwhere YiandYi*is the measured and the estimated compressibility, respectively; n is the sample number (n=7 in this paper).Also, the coefficient of determination R2 is used to show how the estimated values accord with the measured values of the testing samples given in Table 2. Implementation of the estimation is shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) for the ARVM strategy.Meanwhile, we compare the estimated results of the ARVM to that of other techniques, like the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the support vector machines (SVMs) in order to show comparatively the capability of the ARVM. Before the comparisons, regression analysis is carried out as well as the sensitivity analysis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the RVM for estimation of elastic compressibility of sandstone based on its physical properties. Based on the results obtained, conclusions can be obtained as follows:(a)Different physical properties contribute varyingly in estimation of the elastic compressibility of sandstone. The qualitative sensitivity of the properties in descending order is: the detrital clay, the pressure, the feldspar, the pore wall, the micro pore, the average void ratio, the other minerals, the bulk density. The quartz and the pore among particles are not sensible in the regression results.The hyper-parameter of the RVM influences its model performance in estimation. The applied iteration strategy is capable of optimizing the model parameters although it is time-consuming. This strategy can also be used in other related problems.The RVM approach is effective and robust in estimation of the elastic mechanical parameters of sandstone based on its physical properties. The RVM approach is advantageous compared to the ANN and the SVM in the estimation problem presented in this paper.Therefore, the RVM can be used as a robust tool to predict the rock mechanical parameters which are expensive to be identified by the in situ or laboratory tests. However, the adaptive technique is time-consuming and thus new methods for optimization may be further studied to accelerate the calculations. The RVM cannot discover the mechanism resulting in varying elastic compressibility of sandstone with different physical properties. Future work can be tried towards this direction.
