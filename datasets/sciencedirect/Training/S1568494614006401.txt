@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Owing to the fluctuations of the financial market, input data in the options pricing formula cannot be expected to be precise. This paper discusses the problem of pricing geometric Asian options under the fuzzy environment. We present the fuzzy price of the geometric Asian option under the assumption that the underlying stock price, the risk-free interest rate and the volatility are all fuzzy numbers. This assumption makes the financial investors to pick any geometric Asian option price with an acceptable belief degree. In order to obtain the belief degree, the interpolation search algorithm has been proposed. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the rationality and practicability of the model and the algorithm. Finally, an empirical study is performed based on the real data. The empirical study results indicate that the proposed fuzzy pricing model of geometric Asian option is a useful tool for modeling the imprecise problem in the real world.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A standard option is a financial contract which gives the owner of the contract the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified asset to a prespecified price (strike price) at a prespecified time (maturity). In fact, standard options all share the characteristics: one underlying asset, the effective starting time is present, only the price of the underlying asset at the option's maturity affects the payoff of the option, whether an option is a call or a put is known when sold, the payoff is always the difference between the underlying asset price and the strike price. On the other hand, exotic options are options that do not share one or more of the characteristics of the standard options. It is well known that there are two main types of exotic options, correlation options and path dependent options. Correlation options are options whose payoffs are affected by more than one underlying asset. Path dependent options are options whose payoffs are affected by how the price of the underlying asset at maturity was reached, the price path of the underlying asset. One particular path dependent option, called Asian option, offers interesting insights on the profitability of investments.Asian options, whose payoffs depend on the average of the underlying asset price over a prespecified time period, are among the most popular path dependent options traded in both exchanges and over-the counter markets. In fact, Asian options were originally used in 1987 when Banker's Trust Tokyo office used them for calculating average options on crude oil contracts, and give the name Asian option (see Zhang [1]). The main motivation of creating these options is that their averaging feature could reduce the risk of market manipulation of the underlying risky asset near to the maturity date. Since Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option, the prices of these options are usually lower than the prices of standard European options. Generally speaking, there are distinct types of European-style Asian options depending on whether the geometric or arithmetic average is taken, whether the average is observed continuously or discretely and whether the strike price is floating or fixed. Obviously, pricing Asian options is more difficult than pricing standard options. Consequently, many methods for pricing Asian options have been developed over the past two decades.In general, the difficulty of pricing Asian options is that the traditional methods, such as the binomial lattice, the partial differential equation, Fourier transform, Direct integration, Convolution method and Monte Carlo simulation, are inaccurate and impractical. For example, Kemna and Vorst [2] presented an analytic expression for the geometric Asian option, however, a closed-form solution for the arithmetic Asian option has not been found yet. Rogers and Shi [3] reduced the problem of pricing Asian option to the problem of solving a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two variables with the finite difference method. Bénédicte et al. [4] firstly derived a one-state-variable partial differential equation to characterize the valuation of a European type Asian option. The authors also derived some new results on the hedging of an Asian option and proposed analytical and numerical analysis on the comparison between Asian and European options. Eric and Alexandre [5] presented an efficient method for pricing discrete Asian options in the presence of smile and non-proportional dividends. They reduced an n-dimensional problem to a one- or two-dimensional one by using a homogeneity property, and examined different numerical specifications of the dimension reduced PDE. Dubois and Lelièvre [6] considered the PDE proposed by Rogers and Shi [3] and proposed a scheme which produced accurate prices for Asian options. Huguette et al. [7] concentrated on the Cox–Ross–Rubenstein model with a daily time step and derived price intervals for arithmetic Asian options with discrete sampling which are forward starting, whose method is based on comonotonicity and on conditioning on the final value of the underlying asset. Fusai and Meucci [8] presented methodologies to price discretely monitored Asian options when the underlying asset evolves according to a generic Lévy process and provided closed-form solutions in terms of the Fourier transform for geometric Asian options. Moreover, the authors also derived a recursive theoretical formula for pricing arithmetic Asian options by recursive integration. Bayraktar and Xing [9] constructed an exponentially fast sequence of functions that uniformly converged to the price of Asian option, which was written on a stock whose dynamics followed the jump-diffusion, and obtained a fast numerical approximation scheme for the pricing problem. Friedrich and Carlo [10] provided a semi explicit valuation formula for geometric Asian options, with fixed and floating-strike under continuous monitoring, when the underlying stock price process exhibited both stochastic volatility and jumps. Recently, Cai and Kou [11] proposed a closed-form solution for Asian options under the hyper-exponential jump-diffusion model.Although a lot of effort is being spent on improving option pricing model, an efficient and effective method has not to be found yet. A most important factor is that the sources of uncertainty come from not only randomness but also fuzziness. It should be noted that in complicated financial market most of the information on which our decisions are based is linguistic rather than numerical in nature. From this perspective, a new method should be proposed in the problem of pricing options. It is also worth to emphasize that all the papers discussed above assumed that the input variables of the pricing models are regarded as precise real numbers. However, in the real world, the data sometimes cannot be recorded or collected precisely. Especially, the stock price, risk-free interest rate and volatility may be imprecisely determined. For instance, there are many riskless interest rates in financial market, but we do not know whether the riskless interest rate chosen is better or not. Moreover, many financial investors are concerned with the range of options prices, i.e. the prices of options often oscillate within this range. The fuzzy sets theory proposed by Zadeh [12] is a very useful tool for modeling this kind of imprecise problem. The book of collected papers edited by Ribeiro et al. [13] applied the fuzzy set theory to the discipline called financial engineering. Wu [14–16] dealt with the fuzzy European option pricing problems using Black–Scholes pricing formula. Yoshida [17] proposed a new model for pricing European options with uncertainty of both randomness and fuzziness. Lee et al. [18] applied the fuzzy set theory to the Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model to set up the fuzzy binominal European option pricing model which can provide reasonable ranges of options price based on the volatilities of stock prices from greatest to smallest. Thiagarajah et al. [19] considered moment properties for a class of quadratic adaptive fuzzy numbers and obtained the pricing model for European options. Muzzioli et al. [20] obtained a possibility distribution on the risk-neutral probabilities, and performed the risk-neutral valuation of American options as a consequence of the uncertainty in the volatility. Thavaneswaran et al. [21] provided a description of European option price specification errors using the fuzzy weighted possibilistic option valuation model. Xu et al. [22] made an extension of the Merton's normal jump-diffusion model and presented a fuzzy normal jump-diffusion model for pricing European options with uncertainty of both randomness and fuzziness in the jumps. The crisp weighted possibilistic mean normal jump-diffusion model was obtained as well. Yen [23] gave a non-uniform coder in the adaptive neural fuzzy system for option pricing. Zhang et al. [24] proposed the fuzzy pricing formula of American options under the assumption that the price of stock, discount rate, the volatility, and interest rate are all fuzzy numbers. To the best of our knowledge, there are only few papers that studied the problem of pricing exotic options under Fuzzy Environment such as Thavaneswaran et al. [25] and Wang et al. [26]. Recently, Zhan [27] derived the fuzzy patterns of the geometric Asian option pricing formula and the arithmetic Asian option approximate pricing formula by assuming the fuzzy dividend rate, etc., but the author didn’t present the algorithm to calculate the corresponding belief degree with a given price. As far as we know, there is no literature research on pricing geometric Asian options under fuzzy environment. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap.This paper discusses the problem of pricing Asian options under the assumptions that the input parameters in the traditional pricing models are trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose the fuzzy pricing model of Asian call options under the considerations of fuzzy risk-free interest rate, fuzzy volatility and fuzzy stock price. In this situation, the Asian option price turns into a fuzzy number, which makes the financial analyst pick any European option price with an acceptable belief degree for his (her) later use. Second, we design the interpolation search algorithm to solve the fuzzy pricing problem. We also present some numerical examples to illustrate the rationality and practicability of the proposed model and the proposed algorithm. Third, to assess the performance of our fuzzy model and algorithm, we carry out an empirical study using the real data.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the precise pricing model of Asian call option, which was proposed by Kemna and Vorst [2]. We also propose a general fuzzy pattern of Asian call option pricing model in the latter part of this section. In Section 3, we present specific fuzzy pricing formula under the assumptions that the risk-free interest rate, stock price and its volatility are trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In Section 4, we design the interpolation search algorithm for the fuzzy pricing model, and give numerical examples to test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing model and algorithm. In Section 4, the empirical study is performed. Finally, some important conclusions and directions for future research are stated in the final Section 6.Financial products have been weeding through the old to bring forth the new, therefore options have extended many kinds of options called exotic options. Asian options, which are often used for protection against brutal and unexpected changes of prices, represent an important class of exotic options. In fact, Asian options come in various flavors. For example, the average can be arithmetic or it can be geometric. For a plain vanilla Asian option the average is computed over the full trading period, and for a backward-starting option if it is computed over a right subinterval of the trading period. This interval usually has a fixed starting point in time. Moreover, the Asian option can be fixed-strike or floating-strike (if the strike is itself an average). It is called flexible when the payoff is a weighted average, and equally weighted when all the weights are equal. The prices are discretely sampled if the payoff is the average of a discrete set of values of the underlying asset, and continuously sampled if the payoff is the integral of the asset value over some time interval, divided by the length of that interval. Consequently, Asian options are difficult to value since no analytic formula is available even under the standard Black–Scholes environment. For simplicity, we shall focus on Asian call options with geometric average, as Asian put options can be treated similarly.Option pricing theory has made vast strides since 1973, when Black and Scholes published their path-breaking paper providing a model for valuing dividend-protected European options. Black and Scholes used a “replicating portfolio” – a portfolio composed of the underlying asset and the risk-free asset that had the same cash flows as the option being valued – to come up with their final formulation. In following years, because of the popularity in the market, there has been a lot of interest and effort spent in evaluating Asian options. Consequently, many valuation methods for Asian options have been developed after the celebrated Black–Scholes formula. It is well known that different kinds of averages are used, resulting in different types of Asian options, with different values. Since the density of the sum of these components has no explicit representation, it is not possible to produce a closed-form solution for calculating arithmetic Asian options. Moreover, the method of sampling is also important. A continuous sampling may give easier calculations, however, in practice it is usually only possible to obtain the prices in discrete-time samples (e.g., prices collected once a day or, at best, at every tick). Fortunately, in 1990, Kemna and Vorst [2] put forward a closed form of evaluating geometric averaging options by altering the volatility and cost of carry term. Geometric averaging options can be priced through a closed-form analytic solution because of the reason that the geometric average of the underlying prices follows a lognormal distribution as well, whereas with arithmetic average rate options, this condition is not possible. To value Asian options, Kemna and Vorst [2] used the geometric Brownian motion to evaluate the underlying stock price:dS(t)=rS(t)dt+σS(t)dW(t),0≤t≤T,S(0)=SAs usual, r is the risk-free rate, σ is volatility, and Wtis the Brownian motion. Let T be the maturity date and [T0, T] be the final time interval over which the average value of the stock is calculated. Let K denote the strike price and f() denote the pricing formula for the geometric Asian call option. Then the price of the geometric Asian option at time t may be represented as:f(S(t),t,K,r,σ)=e−r(T−t)ES(t),A(t),tmaxA(T)−K,0where T is the maturity time, A(t) is defined as the part of the final average up to time t∈[T0, T], and ES(t), A(t),tis the conditional expectation with respect to S(t), A(t) and t.Kemna and Vorst [2] stated that the payoff of geometric Asian options is given as:A(T)=∏i=0nS(Ti)1/(n+1).Obviously, the variable A(T) is lognormally distributed so that its expectation and variance values may be calculated explicitly. As a consequence, Kemna and Vorst [2] proposed the valuation model for pricing the geometric average option(1)Ct=f(S(t),T−T0,K,r,σ)=S(T0)⋅ed⋅N(d1)−K⋅N(d2)whered=12r−16σ2(T−T0),d1=ln(S(T0)/K)+(1/2)r+(1/6)σ2(T−T0)σ(1/3)(T−T0)d2=d1−σ(1/3)(T−T0)N(x) denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function, r≥0 is the constant risk-free interest rate, σ≥0 is the constant volatility and Ctdenotes the price of a geometric Asian call option at time t.The Asian option pricing model presented above is based on the stochastic environment when the input data are considered as real numbers. In fact, there are many factors that affect the decision-making, including human psychology state, external information input, which are difficult to be derived in term of stochastic measurement. The pricing model of Eq. (1) has the assumptions such as the riskless interest rate and the volatility are constant, that hardly catch human psychology state and external information input about experts’ recommends. Since the pricing model of Eq. (1) is not considered non-preciseness of input data, the vagueness of data is often neglected. Furthermore, it is very difficult to precisely estimate the input parameters because of high complexity of the finance market. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use the pricing model directly and take the input parameters as fixed values for pricing options. In order to solve these problems, it is natural to take the fuzzy stock price, the fuzzy risk-free interest rate and the fuzzy volatility into consideration. In what follows, we assume that the stock price S(t), the risk-free interest rate r, as well as the volatility σ are all fuzzy numbers and establish a fuzzy pricing model using the fuzzy sets theory proposed by Zadeh [12].Let us introduce some definitions and operational characteristics, which will be used in the following section. Let R be a universal set, which is the set of all real numbers. Then a fuzzy subsetA˜is defined by its membership functionμA˜:R→[0,1]. The α-level set ofA˜is defined byA˜α={xμA˜(x)≥α}for all α∈[0, 1]. The 0-level setA˜0ofA˜is defined by the closure of the set{xμA˜(x)>0}which is called a normal fuzzy set if there exists a x such that.a˜is called a fuzzy number if the following conditions are satisfied:(1)a˜is a normal and convex fuzzy set.Its membership functionμα˜is upper semi-continuous.The α-level seta˜αis bounded for each α∈[0, 1].Therefore, ifa˜is a fuzzy number, then the α-level seta˜αis a compact (closed and bounded in R) and convex set; that is,a˜αis a closed interval. The α-level set ofa˜is then denoted bya˜α=[a˜αL,a˜αU].a˜is called a crisp number with value c if its membership function is(2)μa˜(x)=1ifx=c,0otherwise.It is denoted bya˜≡1˜{c}. It is easy to see that(1˜{c})αL=(1˜{c})αU=cfor all α∈[0, 1], and all real numbers are regarded as crisp numbers.Leta˜andb˜be two fuzzy numbers. Thusa˜α=[a˜αL,a˜αU],b˜α=[b˜αL,b˜αU]. Thena˜⊕b˜,a˜b˜anda˜⊗b˜are also fuzzy numbers and their α-level sets are(a˜⊕b˜)α=a˜α⊕b˜α=[a˜αL+b˜αL,a˜αU+b˜αU],(a˜b˜)α=a˜αb˜α=[a˜αL−b˜αU,a˜αU−b˜αL],(a˜⊗b˜)α=a˜α⊗b˜α=[min(a˜αLb˜αL,a˜αLb˜αU,a˜αUb˜αL,a˜αUb˜αU),max(a˜αLb˜αL,a˜αLb˜αU,a˜αUb˜αL,a˜αUb˜αU)]for all α∈[0, 1]. If the α-level setb˜αdoes not contain zero, thena˜b˜is also a fuzzy number and its α-level set is(a˜b˜)α=a˜αb˜α=[min(a˜αL/b˜αL,a˜αL/b˜αU,a˜αU/b˜αL,a˜αU/b˜αU),max(a˜αL/b˜αL,a˜αL/b˜αU,a˜αU/b˜αL,a˜αU/b˜αU)].Moreover, Saeidifar and Pasha [28] introduced the possibilistic mean value and the possibilistic lower semi-variance of a fuzzy numbera˜, which are defined as follows:Leta˜be a fuzzy number with α-level seta˜α=[a˜αL,a˜αU]. Then the possibilistic mean value and possibilistic lower semi-variance ofa˜were expressed as:M¯(a˜)=∫01α(a˜αL+a˜αU)dαandLSVar(a˜)=2∫01α[M¯(a˜)−a˜αL]2dαUnder the considerations of fuzzy stock prices˜, fuzzy interest rater˜and fuzzy volatilityσ˜and the operational rules of fuzzy numbers Wu [14] (where, among others, fuzzy versions of the exp and the log functions are defined), the fuzzy pattern of the geometric Asian option pricing model (1) is described as follows:(3)f˜(s˜,t,K,r˜,σ˜)=(s˜⊗ed˜⊗N˜(d˜1))(1˜{K}⊗e−r˜⊗1˜{t}⊗N˜(d˜2))whered˜=−1˜1/2⊗(r˜⊕(1˜1/6⊗σ˜2))⊗1˜{t},d˜1=ln(s˜1˜{K})⊕(1˜1/2t⊗(r˜⊕(1˜1/6⊗σ˜2))))(σ˜⊗1˜1/3tandd˜2=d˜1σ˜⊗1˜1/3tSince both the strike price K and the time t are real numbers, they are displayed as the crisp numbers1˜{K}and1˜{t}with values K and t, respectively. Then the fuzzy price of an Asian call option at time t is given by the following formula(4)C˜t=f˜(S˜t,T−t,K,r˜,σ˜)whereS˜tandC˜tare fuzzy random variables, for all t∈[0, T].Now we are going to display the left- and right-end points of the closed interval(C˜t)α=[(C˜t)αL,(C˜t)αU]. Since the cumulative distribution function N(x) is increasing, the α-level set ofN˜(d˜)is given by(N˜(d˜))α={N(x):x∈d˜α}={N(x):d˜αL≤x≤d˜αU}=[N(d˜αL),N(d˜αU)].Similarly, since e−xis a decreasing function and lnx is an increasing function of x, the α-level sets ofed˜,e−r˜⊗1˜{T−t}andln(S˜t1˜{K})are then given by(ed˜)α=e−1˜1/2⊗(r˜⊕(1˜1/6⊗σ˜2))⊗1˜{T−t}α=e−(1/2)(r˜αU+(1/6)(σ˜αU)2)(T−t),e−(1/2)(r˜αL+(1/6)(σ˜αL)2)(T−t),e−r˜⊗1˜{T−t}α=e−r˜αU(T−t),e−r˜αL(T−t)and(ln(S˜t1˜{K}))α=[ln((S˜t)αL/K),ln((S˜t)αU/K)].Then the left-end point(C˜t)αLand right-end point(C˜t)αUof the closed interval(C˜t)αcan be calculated as follows:(5)(C˜t)αL=e−(1/2)(r˜αU+(1/6)(σ˜αU)2)(T−t)(S˜t)αLN((d˜1)αL)−Ke−r˜αL(T−t)N((d˜2)αU)and(6)(C˜t)αU=e−(1/2)(r˜αL+(1/6)(σ˜αL)2)(T−t)(S˜t)αUN((d˜1)αU)−Ke−r˜αU(T−t)N((d˜2)αL)where(d˜1)αL=ln((S˜t)αL/K)+(1/2)(r˜αL+(1/6)(σ˜αL)2)(T−t)σ˜αU(1/3)(T−t)(d˜1)αU=ln((S˜t)αU/K)+(1/2)(r˜αU+(1/6)(σ˜αU)2)(T−t)σ˜αL(1/3)(T−t)(d˜2)αL=(d˜1)αL−σ˜αU(1/3)(T−t)and(d˜2)αU=(d˜1)αU−σ˜αL13(T−t)for all α∈[0, 1].The possibilistic mean value and possibilistic low semi-variance ofC˜tare given by(7)M¯(C˜t)=∫01α[(C˜t)αL+(C˜t)αU]dαand(8)LSVar(C˜t)=2∫01α[M¯(C˜t)−(C˜t)αL]2dαThe possibilistic mean valueM¯(C˜t)reflects the average level of option prices, while the possibilistic lower semi-varianceLSVar(C˜t)reflects the information about the spread of option prices around the mean valueM¯(C˜t)and it can be regarded as a risk measure of the prices of call options.In this section, we assume that the stock price s, the volatility σ as well as the risk-free interest rate r are fuzzy numbers of a special form. Thus, we can give the specific fuzzy patterns of the Asian option pricing model. We first introduce the definition of a trapezoidal fuzzy number.Ifa˜is a trapezoidal fuzzy number with tolerance interval [mL, mR], left-width β>0 and right-width γ>0, then its membership function has the following form:(9)μa˜(x)=x−(mL−β)βmL−β≤x≤mL,β>01mL<x≤mR(mR+γ)−xγmR+γ≥x≥mR,γ>00otherwiseThe trapezoidal fuzzy numbera˜is denoted bya˜=(mL,mR,β,γ). We can verify that the α-level sets ofa˜have the following form:a˜α=[a˜αL,a˜αU]=[mL−(1−α)β,mR+(1−α)γ].If the stock priceS˜, volatilityσ˜and risk-free interest rater˜are trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, andS˜=(S1,S2,βs,γs),σ˜=(σ1,σ2,βσ,γσ),r˜=(r1,r2,βr,γr), then we have their α-level set as follows:S˜α=[S1−(1−α)βs,S2+(1−α)γs],σ˜α=[σ1−(1−α)βσ,σ2+(1−α)γσ]r˜α=[r1−(1−α)βr,r2+(1−α)γr]Using the fuzzy pattern of the Asian option pricing model (3), we can obtain the fuzzy pricing formula ofC˜t. The α-level set of Asian options priceC˜tcan be presented by the following crisp form:(10)(C˜t)α=[(C˜t)αL,(C˜t)αU],∀α∈[0,1],(11)(C˜t)αL=e−(1/2)(r2+(1−α)γr+(1/6)(σ2+(1−α)γσ)2)(T−t)(S1−(1−α)βS)N((d˜1)αL)−Ke−(r1−(1−α)βr)(T−t)N((d˜2)αU)and(12)(C˜t)αU=e−(1/2)(r1−(1−α)βr+(1/6)(σ1−(1−α)βσ)2)(T−t)(S2+(1−α)γS)N((d˜1)αU)−Ke−(r2+(1−α)γr)(T−t)N((d˜2)αL)where(d˜1)αL=ln((S1−(1−α)βS)/K)+(1/2)(r1−(1−α)βr+(1/6)(σ1−(1−α)βσ)2)(T−t)(σ2+(1−α)γσ)(1/3)(T−t)(d˜1)αU=ln((S2+(1−α)γs)/K)+(1/2)(r2+(1−α)γr+(1/6)(σ2+(1−α)γσ)2)(T−t)(σ1−(1−α)βσ)(1/3)(T−t)(d˜2)αL=(d˜1)αL−(σ2+(1−α)γσ)(1/3)(T−t)and(d˜2)αU=(d˜1)αU−(σ1−(1−α)βσ)13(T−t).Similarly, the crisp forms of the possibilistic mean valueM¯(C˜t)and the possibilistic lower semi-varianceLSVar(C˜t)ofC˜tcan be also obtained by using (11) and (12).Furthermore, if S1=S2, σ1=σ2 and r1=r2, thenS˜,σ˜andr˜are triangular fuzzy numbers. Thus, the corresponding option prices will be easily obtained by using the above pricing formulas.If βS=βσ=βr=0 and γS=γσ=γr=0, thenS˜,σ˜andr˜are all interval numbers. Using the fuzzy pattern of the Asian option pricing model (10), we can obtain the fuzzy pricing formula ofC˜t. The Asian options priceC˜tcan be given by the following interval:(13)C˜t=[CtL,CtU],(14)CtL=e−(1/2)(r2+(1/6)σ22)(T−t)S1N(d1L)−Ke−r1(T−t)N(d2U)and(15)CtU=e−(1/2)(r1+(1/6)σ12)(T−t)S2N(d1U)−Ke−r2(T−t)N(d2L),whered1L=ln(S1/K)+(1/2)r1+(1/6)σ12(T−t)σ2(1/3)(T−t),d1U=ln(S2/K)+(1/2)r2+(1/6)σ22(T−t)σ1(1/3)(T−t),d2L=d1L−σ2(1/3)(T−t)andd2U=d1U−σ113(T−t).In particular, if S1=S2, σ1=σ2, r1=r2, βS=βσ=βr=0 and γS=γσ=γr=0, thenS˜,σ˜andr˜are all real crisp numbers. It is easily to see thatCtL=CtU. Thus, when the parameters of S, σ and r are assumed to be known exactly, the fuzzy price range will turn into a real crisp number, and the fuzzy option pricing model is equivalent to the traditional Asian option pricing model given in Section 2. Therefore, the fuzzy Asian option pricing model proposed in this paper is an extension of previous pricing models.In a real investment management action, for a given belief degree α, we can calculate the corresponding price interval, the possibilistic mean value and the possibilistic lower semi-variance of an Asian call option using Eqs. (5)–(8). On the other hand, if the investors are comfortable with a given price c of the Asian call option price at time t, then its belief degree α can also be obtained by solving the following optimization problem.SinceCL(α)=(C˜t)αL≤(C˜t)αU=CU(α), we consider the following situations:(1)If CL(1)≤c≤CU(1), then α=1.If c<CL(1), since CU(α)≥CU(1)≥CL(1)≥c, then the optimization problem can be written as:(3) If c>CU(1), since CL(α)≤CL(1)≤CU(1)≤c, then the optimization problem can be written as:(17)(OP4)maxαs.t.CU(α)≥c0≤α≤1In fact, Wu [14] has provided a bisection-searching algorithm to solve the problem of pricing European options. Here we will use the interpolation search algorithm to solve problem (16):Step 1: Let ɛ be the tolerance, and α0=(c−CL(0))/(CL(1)−CL(0)) be the initial value of α. Set α←α0, low←0 and up←1;Step 2: Find CL(α), if CL(α)≤c, then go to Step 3, otherwise go to Step 4;Step 3: If c−CL(α)<ɛ, then EXIT and the maximum is α, otherwise set low←α,α=(c−CL(0))/(CL(low)−CL(0))⋅low, and go to Step 2.Step 4: Set up←α,α=(c−CL(low))/(CL(up)−CL(low))⋅up, and go to Step2.For problem (17), we have the algorithm as follows:Step 1: Let ɛ be the tolerance, and α0=(c−CU(0))/(CU(1)−CU(0)) be the initial value of α. Set α←α0, low←0 and up←1;Step 2: Find CU(α), if CU(α)≤c, then go to Step 3, otherwise go to Step 4;Step 3: If c−CU(α)<ɛ, then EXIT and the maximum is α, otherwise set up←α, α←(CU(0)−c)/(CU(0)−CU(up))·up, and go to Step 2;Step 4: Set low←α,α←(CU(up)−c)/(CU(up)−CU(low))⋅up, and go to Step 2.Then if the investors are comfortable with the obtained belief degree α, then it will be reasonable to take the value c as the Asian option price at time t. The investor can accept the value c as the Asian option price with belief degree α.Next, we will illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing model and the interpolation search algorithm by the following numerical examples.In this section, we present numerical results obtained for the Asian option pricing model proposed in this paper. Although fastest implementation of the proposed algorithms would best be done in lower level languages such as C/C++ (and probably Java), the platform of our choice for implementation was MATLAB as it enables developers in quick prototyping by focusing on higher-level constructs. Now, let us consider an Asian call option on a stock with strike price $25 and with 4 months to expiry. Suppose that the current stock price is around $33, the stock price volatility is around 20% and the risk-free interest rate is around 5% per annum with continuous compounding.Assume that t=0 and T=1/3. The fuzzy interest rater˜, fuzzy volatilityσ˜and fuzzy stock priceS˜0are all assumed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers:r˜=(0.048,0.052,0.013,0.013),σ˜=(0.19,0.21,0.04,0.06)andS˜0=(32.8,33.3,1.8,2.7), respectively. Using the fuzzy option pricing formula above, the current fuzzy priceC˜0of the Asian call option can be obtained.Given different Asian call option prices c, using the interpolation search algorithm discussed above, the belief degreesμC˜0(c)are given in Table 1.Several conclusions can be drawn from Table 1. When the Asian call option price is taken as $7.82, its belief degree is 0.9734. Therefore if the investor is comfortable with this belief degree 0.9734 then, he/she can take this option price $7.82 for his/her later use. If the Asian call option price is $8.20, then its belief degree will be 1.00. As a matter of fact, if we take r=0.05, σ=0.2, S0=33, then the Asian call option price calculated by formula (1) will be $8.20. This situation matches the observation that c=8.20 has belief degree 1.00.To prove that this interpolation search algorithm is more efficient than the bisection search algorithm given by Wu [12], we divide the interval [CL(0),CU(0)] into M=1000 equal parts with M+1 price ci, then the two different algorithms are used to calculateμC˜0(c). All the procedures are programmed in MATLAB using a PC with 2.4GHz Intel Duo Core CPU and 2-GB RAM. Now, the average CPU times (in seconds), which are averages, are presented in Table 2:From Table 2, we can see that the computation time cost by the algorithm proposed in this paper is significantly lower than that by the approach of bisection search. Thus, the interpolation search algorithm is more efficient than bisection search algorithm.Table 3gives the α-level closed intervals(C˜0)αof the fuzzy price.For α=0.95, it means that the call option price will lie in the closed interval [7.7739, 8.5757] with belief degree 0.95. From another point of view, if the investor is comfortable with this belief degree 0.95, then he/she can pick up any value from the closed interval [7.7739, 8.5757] as the option price for his/her later use.The possibilistic mean value and possibilistic lower semi-variance ofC˜tare as follows.M¯(C˜t)=∫01α[(C˜t)αL+(C˜t)αU]dα=8.3023,LSVar(C˜t)=2∫01α([M¯(C˜t)−(C˜t)αL]2)dα=1.6110.It means that the average level of the Asian option prices is $8.3023, and its risk is 1.6110.From the examples we can see that:(1)As the belief degree gradually increasing, the fuzzy price range is gradually decreasing in length. This gives investors more options to choose, for the conservative investors, they can use a high belief degree, but the price range they can use is relatively small, and the price is relatively high; for the aggressive investors, who can accept a lower belief degree, they will have more price to choose from, so they can have a lower price to increase revenue, but accompanied by greater risk, as well.The uncertainty of S0, σ and r have significant impact on the price of Asian options, which cannot be ignored, so, the fuzzy Asian options pricing model we established is more reasonable. Using this fuzzy model, the investor can choose his/her belief degree α to get a fuzzy price interval[(C˜t)αL,(C˜t)αU]. The investors can use the interval in the future as Asian option price prediction to guide the investment strategies. Also, we can calculate the corresponding belief degree of a given price, which can also help the investor to make a right investment decision.In this section, we use actual cases to explain the process of the proposed fuzzy Asian option pricing model. Firstly, we need to identify the variables and data characteristics, which are described as below.The data were obtained from the Bloomberg database for E0015 option prices, which was issued by BNP Paribas. From the Bloomberg database, we obtain that the underlying security of this Asian option is the SX5E Index. The sample data consist of daily closing prices for E0015 option prices from April 2nd, 2014 to June 6th 2014. The index price and option price at issuing date are 3191.70 and 26.95, respectively. The strike price of E0015 option is 3500.For practical purposes, this section is divided in two parts. In the first part, the price of E0015 option is studied under the fuzzy environment at a given trade date. In the second part, the market price time series of E0015 option is studied under the fuzzy environment during the sample period.The E0015 option pricing is studied on June 6th 2014. Obviously, we should use the trading days instead of calendar days. Thus the unit must be annualized. However, the life of an option is usually less than one year. Consequently, we use the 3-month US Treasury bill rate to substitute for the riskless interest rate. Moreover, we use historical data to estimate volatility. Finally, we obtain the following parameters: the interest rate is around 0.04%, the historical volatility is around 14.24%, the price of underlying asset is around 3252.68, and the strike price is 3500 with 0.42 year. The market price of this option on June 6th 2014 is 58.25USD.As a consequence, the fuzzy interest rater˜, the fuzzy volatilityσ˜and the fuzzy stock priceS˜0can be denoted as:r˜=(0.0003,0.0004,0.0001,0.0002),σ˜=(0.15,0.17,0.05,0.05)andS˜0=(3220,3260,50,50), respectively. The current fuzzy priceC˜0of an Asian call option can be obtained based on the proposed fuzzy model. Then Table 4gives the belief degreesμC˜t(c)for the possible E0015 option price c by solving the optimization problems (16) and (17) using the computational procedure proposed above. If the above Asian option price $58.25 is taken, then its belief degree is 1.00. Hence, if financial investors are tolerable with this belief degree 1.00, then they can take this price $58.25 for their later use. If the price is taken as c=$61.00, then its belief degree will be 0.9811. The α-level closed interval(C˜t)αof the fuzzy price(C˜t)αis shortening as α-level is rising. Table 5gives the α-level closed interval(C˜t)αof the fuzzy price(C˜t)of the Asian call option with the different α value. For α=0.98, it means that the option price will lie in the closed interval [54.2839, 61.8188] with belief degree 0.98. From another point of view, if financial investors are comfortable with this belief degree 0.98, then they can pick any value from the interval [54.2839, 61.8188] as the option price for their later use.To illustrate the performance of the proposed fuzzy model, we next perform experiment based on the daily historical data of E0015 option during the period from April 2nd, 2014 to June 6th 2014. Three input variables, such as,r˜,σ˜andS˜t, are assumed to symmetrical trapezoidal fuzzy number. In view of the actual market fluctuation, the fluctuation spreads are assumed to the following values. Thus, (i) the left (negative) and right (positive) spreads ofr˜are both 0.02% of their core values (i.e. market data), respectively; (ii) the left and right spreads ofS˜tis 0.5% of its core values; (iii) the left and right spreads ofσ˜is 0.5% of its core values. The reason for this determination comes from the real market fluctuation during the selected sample period.Fig. 1illustrates that the market prices of E0015 option lie in the closed intervals with belief degrees 90% and 95%. Therefore, if financial investors are tolerable with this belief degree 90% or 95%, then they can pick any price from this 90%-level interval or 95%-level interval as the option price for their later use at any a trade date from April 2nd, 2014 to June 6th 2014. Therefore, our fuzzy pricing model of geometric Asian option can offer reasonable price intervals with the corresponding belief degrees, which are helpful for financial investors’ decision-making.
