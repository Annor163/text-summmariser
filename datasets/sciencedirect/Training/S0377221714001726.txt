@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Most previous related studies on warehouse configurations and operations only investigated single-level storage rack systems where the height of storage racks and the vertical movement of the picking operations are both not considered. However, in order to utilize the space efficiently, high-level storage systems are often used in warehouses in practice. This paper presents a travel time estimation model for a high-level picker-to-part system with the considerations of class-based storage policy and various routing policies. The results indicate that the proposed model appears to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. Furthermore, the effects of storage and routing policies on the travel time and the optimal warehouse layout are discussed in the paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Order picking, the activity of retrieving items from storage locations to satisfy customer orders, is a major costly constituent of warehouse operations and has an important influence on supply chain’s productivity (Coyle, Bardi, & Langley, 1996; Wascher, 2004). Various types of order picking system are used in warehouses; among them, one of the most common systems in industrial settings is the picker-to-part order picking system where items are stored on racks or bins such that a picker travels to storage locations by walking or driving along the aisles to retrieve all the items specified in a picking list (De Koster, Le-Duc, & Roodbergen, 2007). For such a system, Tompkins, White, Bozer, Frazelle, and Tanchoco (2003) showed that the dominant component of the picking time is travel time (50%). Since travel time costs labor hours but does not add value, it is waste (Bartholdi & Hackman, 2011). Petersen and Aase (2004) suggested that the interaction between the routing method and the storage assignment rule is important in a manual order picking system. A storage assignment rule attempts to provide an effective way of locating products in order to improve the operational efficiency of order picking. Since the storage assignment problem is in the class of NP-hard problems (Frazelle & Sharp, 1989), many heuristic methods for storage assignment have been proposed. Class-based storage policies classify items into classes and usually assign a fixed area to each class in which items are randomly allocated in that area. Brynzer and Johansson (1995) proposed a storage assignment strategy derived from the product framework by using variant characteristics as picking information to reduce picking time. Eynan and Rosenblatt (1994) presented a one-dimensional search algorithm to determine the boundaries for any desired number of classes in an automated warehouse. Tang and Chew (1997) considered batching and storage allocation strategies in a manual order picking system of small parts which processes high volume of orders. Muppani and Adil (2008) developed an optimal solution procedure for storage class formation by considering area usage, handling cost and storage space cost. Chan and Chan (2011) presented a simulation study of a real case regarding storage assignment issue in a manual-pick with multi-level-rack warehouse, and indicated that the key to effective implementation of a storage assignment system is to match the types of warehouse storage systems and the variety of items in the customer orders.For routing policies, the issue is to obtain a sequence of items to be retrieved from racks such that the total travel distance is as short as possible. For picker-to-part order picking systems, numerous routing methods, including optimal algorithms, have been proposed (Hall, 1993). Petersen II and Schmemmer (1999) applied simulation technique to evaluate routing heuristics that incorporate popularity-based storage policies. Roodbergen and De Koster (2001) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm to find an order-picking tour of minimal length in a warehouse with multiple cross aisles. The return, traversal and midpoint policies are prevalent routing strategies in practice because of the convenience of their implementation (Hwang, Oh, & Lee, 2004). Under return policy, a picker enters the aisles containing picks from one end to perform the pick, and then exits from the same end, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The simplest routing policy is traversal, also called S-shape policy. Fig. 1(b) illustrates that a picker enters an aisle containing items in the order from one end and leaves from the opposite end under traversal policy. For midpoint policy, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the warehouse is divided equally into two areas where a picker accesses the front half of an aisle from the front cross aisle, and the back half from the back cross aisle. The picker traverses to the back half by either the last or the first aisle to be visited. Hwang et al. (2004) proposed three analytical models of expected travel distance for these three routing policies and examined their performance by varying the parameter values of the COI-based ABC curve, number of items in the list, and ratio of the length to the width of the warehouse. Caron, Marchet, and Perego (1998, 2000) presented an analytical model for traversal and return policies under the COI-based ABC curve and subsequently developed a framework for layout design. Le-Duc and De Koster (2005) proposed a probabilistic model to estimate the average travel distance of a picking tour with class-based storage strategy. Gu, Goetschalckx, and McGinnis (2010) indicated that an analytical model is important for both warehouse design and operation purposes, because it enables a designer to quickly evaluate design alternatives and narrow down the design space at the early design stage. Therefore, the development of a model to accurately analyze the travel distance is crucial before any solution (optimal) algorithm can be proposed for operating policies.Gray, Karmarkar, and Seidmann (1992) described and modeled the composite design and operating problems of a typical order-consolidation warehouse where detailed simulation employing actual warehousing data was used. Petersen II (1997) evaluated the impacts of warehouse shape and pick-up/drop-off locations on routing performance. Chew and Tang (1999) proposed a travel time model with general item location assignment in a single block rectangular warehouse by treating the order picking system as an Ek/G/1 queueing system. Based on Chew and Tang’s work (1999), Le-Duc and De Koster (2007) considered a 2-block warehouse and conducted an analysis on the average throughput time of random orders with the assumption that orders arrive according to a Poisson process and used the traversal policy for routing order pickers. Nieuwenhuyse and De Koster (2009) presented an analytical approach for approximating the expected system throughput time and illustrated that an optimal batching policy which minimizes the expected customer order throughput time can be found. Hwang and Cho (2006) proposed a performance evaluation model for the order picking warehousing system in a supply center by using both a mathematical method and AutoMod simulation software. Pan and Shih (2008) proposed a throughput model for the determination of picking operation performance for a multi-picker environment by considering a trade-off between the picking distance and the blocking-caused delay for storage assignment. Schleyer and Gue (2012) developed discrete time models for the throughput time distribution of orders arriving to a one-block warehouse to determine the optimal batch size, given a desired probability of on-time order fulfillment. Pan and Wu (2012) developed an approximation method based on a GI/G/1 closed queueing network by using self-correcting approximation technique to evaluate the throughput time of an order picking system with multiple pickers and aisle congestion considerations for various routing policiesThe picker-to-part systems can be distinguished into two types (De Koster et al., 2007): low-level picking and high-level picking. In low-level systems, a picker travels along the storage aisles having single-level storage racks and picks requested items from storage racks. In high-level systems, or man-onboard order picking systems, high storage racks are used and a picker travels to the pick locations on board of a lifting order-pick truck or crane where the truck or crane automatically stops in front of the appropriate locations and waits for the picker to perform a pick. While most previous researches focused on low-level systems and considered only horizontal picking effort, maximizing the use of space remains as one of the objectives in warehouse design and optimization (De Koster et al., 2007). The design of high-level picking systems can utilize the vertical space and reduce floor space needs (Parikh & Meller, 2010). In practice, many order picking systems not only have horizontal travel but include vertical travel as well. Parikh and Meller (2010) indicated that a model may be used to determine the optimal storage system configuration when it is able to consider vertical travel.Parikh and Meller (2010) investigated high-level systems by considering randomized storage policy and one routing policy. Storage assignment policies influence almost all key performance indicators of a warehouse such as order picking time and cost (Muppani and Adil, 2008). The purposed of this paper is to present an evaluation method for high-level picker-to-part systems incorporating class-based storage policy and three common routing policies, i.e., return, traversal and midpoint policies. The comparison of the characteristics between this paper and previous researches is summarized in Table 1. The proposed model can be used to evaluate the effects of popularity skewness, storage assignment and routing polices on the travel time for the order picking systems under investigation. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the results generated are compared and validated via simulation. Moreover, the optimal warehouse layout can be determined by the proposed model in order to reduce travel distance based on the routing and storage assignment policies used.The warehouse under study is rectangular with stocking aisles running vertical to the I/O point. Items are delivered by rider pallet trucks and then unloaded at the I/O point. There are two cross aisles in the warehouse, one at the front and the other at the back, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The I/O point is located in the middle of the front cross aisle such that the warehouse is divided into two parts, the right side and the left side, respectively, of the I/O point. The right (left) side has IR(IL) aisles, all of which are assumed to have J pick-columns in the two sides of an aisle. In such a high-level picking system, there are K levels in a pick-column as shown in Fig. 3. Assume that the pick-columns on both sides of an aisle are merged into one side, so that pickers only consider one side of an aisle to pick (Parikh & Meller, 2010).One of the important issues of the warehouse operation is the way customer orders are assigned to order pickers. Strict order picking refers to the case where each customer order is retrieved by a single picker. The capacity of a picker is sufficiently large to handle all the items in a picking tour.The following assumptions on the warehouse under study and the picking operations are made in the paper:(1)Each item is independent of the other items within an order (Le-Duc & De Koster, 2007).All the information about the orders to be picked is known in advance.The effects of the acceleration and deceleration in an order picker truck can be neglected.The time to pick an item from a rack is constant.All items of all orders have the same sizes and weights.Only one item type can be stored in a rack.Six storage assignment polices based on the picking frequency of items are adopted in the warehouse system under study. For class-based storage policy, previous researches only considered the distribution of items among aisles for the low-level picker-to-part systems. Pan and Wu (2012) indicated that if all items are distributed into each aisle equally, the throughput of the system can be improved. Thus, the distribution of items among aisles is kept the same under all storage assignment polices in this study except for the random policy. These policies are described below and illustrated in Fig. 4.(a)Random policyThe random storage policy is widely used in many warehouses because it is simple to use, often requires less space than other storage methods, and results in a better level utilization of all picking aisles (Petersen II and Schmemmer, 1999).(b)Across pick-column policy (AP)The highest frequency item is assigned to the lowest level rack of the first pick-column, the next highest frequency one is assigned to the lowest level rack of the second pick-column, and so on. Once the lowest level racks of all the pick-columns are assigned, the second lowest level rack of each pick-column is then assigned.(c)Within pick-column for single side (WS)The highest frequency item is stocked in the lowest level rack of the first pick-column near the front aisle and the second highest one is stocked in the second lowest level rack of the first pick-column, and so on. After the first pick-column is filled, the next highest frequency item is stocked in the lowest level rack of the second pick-column, and so on. That is, the area that is close to the front aisle contains higher frequency items and the area close to the back aisle contains lower frequency items.(d)Within pick-column for double sides (WD)This method is similar to the previous one, except for the pick-columns near the front aisle and the back aisle both are assigned first.(e)Diagonal pick-column for single side (DS)Items are stored in the aisles in a diagonal pattern, with the highest frequency item locating closest to the front aisle.(f)Diagonal pick-column for double sides (DD)Similar to the previous one except that the highest frequency items are located closest to the front aisle and the back aisle.The notations used in this article are described below.Nthe number of items to be picked in a tourIR, ILthe number of aisles in the right side or left side of the warehouse systemnithe number of items to be picked in an order in aisle i, i=1L, 2L, … , IL, 1R, 2R, … , IRKthe number of storage levels in an aisleJthe number of pick-columns in an aislehrthe height of a storage rackwrthe width of a storage rackwathe width of an aislewsthe depth of an storage rackDathe distance between the aisle entrance/exit and front aisleDbthe distance between the aisle entrance/exit and back aisleDIthe distance between the I/O point and front aislevhthe horizontal speed of the order picker truckvvthe vertical speed of the order picker truckpijkL,pijkRthe probability that at least one item is picked at storage level j of pick-column k locating at the right or left side of aisle i, i=1L, 2L, … , IL, or i=1R, 2R, … , IR; j=1, 2, … , J and k=1, 2, … , K. In real world, a probability can be determined by the historical demand rate of an itempithe probability that at least one item is picked in aisle i, i=1L, 2L, … , IL, or i=1R, 2R, … , IRCthe number of aisles crossed given N items to be picked in a tourZthe number of aisles visited given N items to be picked in a tourGenerally speaking, the travel time of a pick tour in a picker-to-part system can be divided into three components (Parikh & Meller, 2010): (1) the travel time across the aisles; (2) the travel time in each aisle; (3) the travel time from and to the I/O point. Since the warehouse is divided into two areas, the expected travel time of a pick tour given N items to be picked, E[Ttotal|N], can be expressed as follows:(1)E[Ttotal|N]=E[Tcross|N]+∑i=1RIRE[Taislei]+∑i=1LILE[Taislei]+ETI/OpointFor the warehouse system under investigation, the travel time between the I/O point and the front aisle is constant; so,(2)E[Ttotal|N]=E[Tcross|N]+∑i=1RIRE[Taislei]+∑i=1LILE[Taislei]+2DI/vhFor traversal policy, a picker must pass through an aisle again to go back to the I/O point if he/she visits odd number of aisles. Thus, E[Ttotal|N] for the traversal policy should be amended as follows:(3)E[Ttotal|N]=E[Tcross|N]+∑i=1RIRE[Taislei]+∑i=1LILE[Taislei]+2DI/v+P{Z=odd|N}×wr×J/vhAccording to Chew and Tang (1999), the lower bound of P{Z=odd|N} is 1/2. For simplicity, this lower bound is used directly to estimate the travel time for the traversal policy.The travel path of cross aisles includes Da, Db, wsand wa, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Hence, the expected cross aisle time given N items to be picked can be formulated as(4)E[Tcrosss|N]=((2ws+wa)+(E[C|N]-1)(2wa+4ws)+2E[Z|N](Da+Db))/vhwhere E[C|N] is the expected number of aisle crossed and E[Z|N] is the expected number of aisle visited. Chew and Tang (1999) derived the way to find the average position of the last aisle visited for a single block warehouse. If all the aisles visited in an order reside in one side of the I/O point, Chew and Tang’s model (1999) can be modified to estimate the expected number of aisle crossed given N items to be picked, E[C|N]. The probability that at least one item to be picked in aisle i is the summation of the picking probability at all racks in that aisle and it follows that(5)pi=∑j=1J∑k=1KpijkL+pijkRfori=1L,2L,…,IL,1R,2R,…,IR.Consequently, the expected number of aisles crossed given N items to be picked can be expressed as(6)E[C|N]=IR∑i=1RIRpiN-∑i=1RIR-1∑j=1RipjN+IL∑i=1LILpiN-∑i=1LIL-1∑j=1LipjNThe other situation occurs when the aisles visited locate on both sides of the I/O point. LetAiLandAiRbe the number of items to be picked in aisle i in left side and right side, respectively. The probability mass function that picking aisles locate in the left side and right side with the condition that at least one picking item is in each of the lth and rth aisles given N items to be picked is(7)PA1L⩾0,A2L⩾0,…,AlL>0,Al+1L=⋯=AIL=0,A1R⩾0,A2R⩾0,…,ArR>0,Ar+1R=⋯=AIR=0|N=∑j=1Llpj+∑j=1RrpjN-∑j=1Ll-1pj+∑j=1RrpjN+∑j=1Llpj+∑j=1Rr-1pjN+∑j=1Ll-1pj+∑j=1Rr-1pjNforl=1,2,3,…,ILandr=1,2,3,…,IR.The expected number of cross aisles between the left side and right side can be stated as follows:(8)E[C|N]=∑r=1RIR∑l=1LIL(l+r)∑j=1Llpj+∑j=1RrpjN-∑j=1Ll-1pj+∑j=1RrpjN+∑j=1Llpj+∑j=1Rr-1pjN+∑j=1Llpj+∑j=1Rr-1pjN=(IR+IL)-∑i=1RIR-1∑j=1LILpj+∑j=1RipjN-∑j=1RipjN-∑i=1LIL-1∑j=1RIRpj+∑j=1LipjN-∑j=1LipjN-(IR+1)∑j=1RIRpjN+(IL+1)∑j=1LILpjNThe term E[Z|N] in Eq. (4) can be obtained from Chew and Tang (1999) and expressed for this study as follows(9)E[Z|N]=(IR+IL)-∑i=1RIR(1-pi)N+∑i=1LIL(1-pi)NThe expected travel time within aisle i, E[Taisle i], depends on both the routing and storage polices, and can be divided into four parts (Parikh & Meller, 2010): (i) the expected travel time between pick-columns, (ii) the expected vertical travel time in each pick-column, (iii) the expected travel time to reach the first picking rack, and (iv) the expected travel time to leave the aisle, and can be presented as:(10)E[Taislei]=ETicol+ETiver+ETifirst+ETiexitTo develop the expected travel time between pick-columns, the probability mass function that a picker goes to level b of pick-column (j+c) after he/she picks the items at level a of pick-column j in aisle i needs to be defined. According to the assumption that the pick-columns on both sides of an aisle are merged into one side, the picking probability at level k of pick-column j in aisle i is(11)pijk=pijkL+pijkRfori=1L,2L,…,IL,1R,2R,…,IRNote that the numbering of pick-columns and aisles has to be modified under midpoint and traversal policies for the expected travel time within aisle, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.Moreover, it is necessary to know how a picker travels between pick-columns for the development of the expected travel time between pick-columns. A picker can choose to first pick from the bottommost or the topmost rack in a pick-column of an order, and he/she will pick the same way for all the subsequent picks in that order. Fig. 7illustrates the picking path of a picker who always picks from the bottommost within an aisle, under three types of routing polices.Let R(i,j,k) denote the event that a picker is at level k of pick-column j in aisle i and rijkdenote the number of items to be picked at level k of pick-column j in aisle i. Given niitems to be picked in aisle i, the conditional probability mass function, P{R(i,j,a) to R(i,j+c,b)|ni}, can be presented as(12)P{ri11⩾0,ri12⩾0,…,rija⩾0,rij(a+1)=rij(a+2)=⋯=ri(j+c)(b-1)=0,ri(j+c)b⩾1,ri(j+c)(b+1)⩾0,ri(j+c)(b+2)⩾0,…,riJK⩾0|ni}=1-∑k=a+1Kpijk′-∑x=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+x)k′-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k′ni-1-∑k=a+1Kpijk′-∑x=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+x)k′-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k′-pija′ni-1-∑k=a+1Kpijk′-∑x=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+x)k′-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k′-pijb′ni+1-∑k=a+1Kpijk′-∑z=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+z)k′-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k′-pija′-pi(j+c)b′Nwherepijk′=pijk/pi.In addition, the probability that the number of items to be picked in aisle i is ni, f(ni), follows a binomial distribution and can be expressed as(13)f(ni)=Nni(pi)ni(1-pi)1-niforni=0,1,2,…,N.Therefore, the probability P{R(i,j,a) to R(i,j+c,b)} can be obtained by(14)∑ni=1NNniP{R(i,j,a)toR(i,j+c,b)|ni}×(pi)ni×(1-pi)N-ni=1-∑k=a+1Kpijk-∑z=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+z)k-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)kN-1-∑k=a+1Kpijk-∑z=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+z)k-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k-pijaN-1-∑k=a+1Kpijk-umz=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+z)k-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k-pi(j+c)bN+1-∑k=a+1Kpijk-∑z=1c-1∑k=1Kpi(j+z)k-∑k=1b-1pi(j+c)k-pija-pi(j+c)bNThe same results can be obtained if the picker chooses to pick first from the topmost rack.Tchebychev travel typically can be performed in the high-level picker-to-part systems (Parikh & Meller, 2010). The expected travel time between pick-columns is the maximum of the horizontal and vertical travel times to reach next pick location from the current location using Tchebychev travel. Therefore, the expected travel time between pick-columns in aisle i is(15)ETicol=∑j=1J-1∑c=1J-j∑b=1K∑a=1Kmax{|a-b|×hr/vv,c×wr/vh}×P{R(i,j,a)toR(i,j+c,b)}Under traversal policy, it is necessary to consider the way that a picker enters an aisle in order to findETicolsince he/she may enter from either the front aisle or the back aisle. Let Xi=1 denote that a picker enters aisle i from the front aisle, and 2 from the back aisle, respectively. The probability distribution of random variable Xigiven N items is(16)P(Xi)=P(Xi-1=1)(1-pi)N+P(Xi-1=0)1-(1-pi)N,Xi=1P(Xi-1=1)1-(1-pi)N+P(Xi-1=0)(1-pi)N,Xi=2All of the pick-columns in aisle i need to be numbered sequentially for estimating theETicolbecause of the different directions of a picker entering aisle i under traversal policy, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). The expected travel time between pick-columns in aisle i given random variable Xican be expressed as(17)ETicol|Xi=∑j=1J(Xi)-1∑c=1J(Xi)-j∑b=1K∑a=1Kmax{|a-b|×hr/vv,c×wr/vh}×P{R(i,j,a)toR(i,j+c,b)}forXi=1,2Consequently, the expected travel time between pick-columns in aisle i for this policy can be obtained as(18)ETicol=∑xi=12ETicolXi=xP(Xi=x)For midpoint policy, a picker generally cannot cross the central line; however, when finishing the picking of right-hand side in the lower half of the warehouse, he/she must traverse to the upper half as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). Similarly, after finishing the picking in the upper half, the picker traverses for the remaining items and then goes to back the I/O point. As a result, the traversal policy should be used in this situation. If there is only one aisle that needs to be visited to fulfill the order, the picker would go directly to the I/O point after the picking operation. Thus the return policy should be adopted in this case. Next, a random variable Yiis defined to describe these different cases, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). For picking aisle i, Yi=1 denotes that it is a rightmost aisle and traversal policy should be adopted, Yi=2 denotes that it is a leftmost one and also traversal policy is adopted, Yi=3 denotes that it is only aisle that needs to be visited and return policy is adopted, and Yi=4 indicates that midpoint policy is adopted for aisle i. Consequently, the probability distribution of random variable Yiis(19)P(Yi)=1-∑a>ipaN-1-∑a⩾ipaN-piN,Yi=11-∑a<ipaN-1-∑a⩽ipaN-piN,Yi=2piN,Yi=31-∑i=03P(Yi),Yi=4Similarly, all the pick-columns are renumbered based on the direction the picker enters the aisle. The expected travel time between pick-columns in aisle i given random variable Yican be expressed as(20)ETicol|Yi=∑j=1J(Yi)-1∑c=1J(Yi)-j∑b=1K∑a=1Kmax{|a-b|×hr/vv,c×wr/vh}×P{R(i,j,a)toR(i,j+c,b)}forYi=1,2,3,4The expected travel time between pick-columns in aisle i for midpoint policy is(21)ETicol=∑yi=14ETicol|Yi=yP(Yi=y)The expected vertical travel time in each pick-column in aisle i,ETiver, can be obtained as(22)ETiver=∑a=1K-1∑b=a+1K(b-a)×wr/vv×P{bottomij=a,topij=b}where P{bottomij=a, topij=b} is the joint probability mass function of the bottommost and topmost locations having items to be picked in pick-column j in aisle i. Given nijitems to be picked at pick-column j in aisle i, P{bottomij=a, topij=b|nij} can be expressed as(23)Prij1=rij2=⋯=rij(a-1)=0,rija>0,rij(a+1)⩾0,rij(a+1)⩾0,…,rij(b-1)⩾0,rijb>0,rij(b+1)=rij(b+2)=⋯=rijk=0|nij}=∑k=abpijk′nij-∑k=ab-1pijk′nij-∑k=a+1bpijk′nij+∑k=a-1b-1pijk′nijwherepijk′=pijk∑k=1Kpijk.Therefore, P{bottomij=a, topij=b} can be calculated by(24)∑nij=0NP{bottomij=a,topij=b|nij}P{nij}=1-∑k=1a-1pijk-∑k=b+1KpijkN-1-∑k=1apijk-∑k=b+1KpijkN-1-∑k=1a-1pijk-∑k=bKpijkN+1-∑k=1apijk-∑k=bKpijkNTo estimate the expected travel time to reach the first picking location, it is necessary to develop the probability function that a rack will first be visited in aisle i. Given niitems to be picked in aisle i, the conditional probability that the first picking location is at rack level b of pick-column a in aisle i can be expressed as(25)P{firstpickinglocationi=a,b|ni}=Prij1=rij2=⋯=ria(b-1)=0,riab>0,ria(b+1)⩾0,ria(b+2)⩾0,…,riJK⩾0|ni=Prij1=rij2=⋯=ria(b-1)=0,riab⩾0,ria(b+1)⩾0,ria(b+2)⩾0,…,riJK⩾0|ni-Prij1=rij2=⋯=ria(b-1)=0,riab=0,ria(b+1)⩾0,ria(b+2)⩾0,…,riJK⩾0|ni=∑j=a+1J∑k=1Kpijk+∑k=bKpiakni-∑j=a+1J∑k=1Kpijk+∑k=b+1KpiakniThus, P{first picking locationi=a, b} can be obtained as(26)∑ni=0NP{first picking locaitoni=a,b|ni}P{ni}=1-∑j=1a-1pij-∑k=1b-1piakN-1-∑j=1a-1pij-∑k=1bpiakNwherepij=∑k=1KPijk.Assume that a picker goes back to the lowest level rack after the completion of the picking in an aisle and start to pick from the aisle entrance. Using Tchebychev travel measurement,ETifirst, the third term in Eq. (10), is the maximum of the horizontal and vertical travel times to reach the first picking location from the cross aisle. As previously stated, the way that a picker enters an aisle should be considered. Thus,ETifirstfor the three routing policies can be found as follows:(1)Return policy: A picker always enters an aisle from the front aisle. Hence,(2)Traversal policy: A picker may enter from the front aisle (Xi=1) or the back aisle (Xi=2) to pick items. Thus,(3)Midpoint policy: as the description of Eq. (19), a picker has four ways to enter an aisle. Given variable Yi,The development of the expected travel time to leave the aisle,ETiexit, depends on the last picking location and the direction of a picker leaving the aisle after he/she finishes the picking operation. Similar to Eq. (25),P{last locationi=a,b|ni}can be expressed as(30)Prij1⩾0,rij2⩾0,…,ria(b-1)⩾0,riab>0,ria(b+1)=ria(b+2)=⋯=riJK=0|ni=Prij1⩾0,rij2⩾0,…,ria(b-1)⩾0,riab⩾0,ria(b+1)=ria(b+2)=⋯=riJK=0|ni-Prij1⩾0,rij2⩾0,…,ria(b-1)⩾0,riab=ria(b+1)=⋯=riJK=0|ni=∑j=1a-1∑k=1Kpijk+∑k=1bpiakni-∑j=1a-1∑k=1Kpijk+∑k=1b-1piakniSo, P{last locationi=a, b} is given by(31)E[{last locationi=a,b|ni}]=1-∑j=a+1Jpij-∑k=b+1KpiakN-1-∑j=a+1Jpij-∑k=bKpiakNSimilarly,EYiexitcan be investigated for the three policies as follows:(1)Return policy: a picker always leaves an aisle from the front aisle. Thus,EYiexitcan be estimated as(2)Traversal policy: a picker leaves an aisle from the front aisle or the back aisle; soEYiexitis(3)Midpoint policy: as the description of Eq. (19), a picker has four ways to leave an aisle. Consequently, it follows thatTo conclude, the expected time to leave the aisle for this policy is(35)ETiexit=∑y=14ETiexit|Yi=y×P(Yi=y)Based on the proposed various travel time evaluation models, the average travel time of a pick tour for the three routing polices can be obtained by the following procedure:Step 1: Use Eq. (4) to estimate the expected cross aisle time.Step 2: Estimate the travel time in each aisle by the following sub-procedures:Step 2.1: Depending on the routing polices, use Eqs. (15)–(21) to estimate the expected travel time between pick-columns for all aisles.Step 2.2: Use Eq. (22) to estimate the expected vertical travel time in each pick-column for all aisles.Step 2.3: Depending on the routing polices, use Eqs. (27)–(29) to estimate the expected travel time to reach the first picking rack for all aisles.Step 2.4: Depending on the routing polices, use Eqs. (32)–(34) to estimate the expected travel time to leave the aisle for all aisles.Step 3: Introduce the expected cross aisle time and the travel time in each aisle obtained from Step 1 and Step 2 into Eq. (3) for traversal routing policy, or Eq. (2) for other two routing polices, to estimate the expected travel time of a pick tour.A warehouse was designed to implement the proposed analytical model and a simulation software package was used in order to validate the accuracy of the proposed evaluation model. The warehouse layout has five picking aisles on both sides of the I/O point a front and a back cross aisles. Each side of a picking aisle has 10 pick-columns with five levels of racks. Since only one item can be stored in a rack, each aisle stores 100 items. Moreover, the demand for the items is based on an 80/20 distribution; that is, 20% of the items account for 80% of the picking activities. Because it is difficult to obtain the demand rates of items and the specifications of the warehouse in real world, each picking probability is generated randomly and the specifications are cited from the Parikh and Meller’s research (2010), as exhibited in Table 2. It is assumed that a picker always starts the picking from the bottommost rack in a pick-column of an order, as shown in Fig. 7. The simulation model was developed using FlexSim package software (2007) which is a 3D object-oriented simulation environment for modeling discrete-event flow processes.The model was run 300 times for each scenario, and the mean travel time and standard deviation for each scenario were computed. The differences between the values predicted analytically and the simulation results are listed in Table 3, where the difference is expressed as (the time calculated from the evaluation method – the time generated from simulation)/the time generated from the simulation model×100%. Table 3 indicates that the proposed evaluation method provides a relatively good approximation of the travel time of each scenario for the high-level system under study since the differences in general are less than 5.62%.Further analysis was conducted to study the sensitivity of the results to various policies and levels of input parameters including the number of levels of racks, the number of pick-columns and the demand distribution of items.Fig. 8shows the travel time found by the proposed model under different routing and storage assignment policies for N=15. The results in Fig. 8 indicate that AP, DS and DD are significantly better than the other three policies under all of the routing policies. Because the items with higher demand rates are located in the lower level racks using the AP, DS and DD policies, the travel times will be shorter when the speed of the horizontal movement is faster than that of the vertical movement. For routing polices, there is no significant difference among these three routing policies under all storage assignment policies. However, Hwang et al. (2004) indicated that, without the consideration of vertical movement, midpoint routing policy gives better performance. The difference in the findings implies that a trade-off may exist between the horizontal and the vertical travel times in the high-level picking systems. If the vertical travel time is incorporated into the picking time, the impact of the horizontal movement may be diluted.To study the impact of the popularity skewness, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the 60/20 and 50/20 distributions of the items in addition to the 80/20 distribution and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The results indicate that no routing policies have evident advantage on the order picking performance. For the comparison of storage assignment policies, AP, DS and DD are still better than the other three polices under all scenarios. In particular, 80/20 exhibits the greatest impact on the travel time among the popularity skewnesses tested.A warehouse having 1000 picking racks was investigated by considering four configurations of different numbers of levels of racks and pick-columns, along with various routing and storage assignment policies. The results are shown in Fig. 10and the configuration is denoted by Level×Pick-column in the figure. For the low-level picking systems of configurations 1×50, the routing policies exhibit a significantly different impact from the work of Hwang et al. (2004). Midpoint policy offers better performance for almost every storage policy because of shorter horizontal travel distance within aisles, especially for WD and DD policies. Fig. 10 also reveals that the performances of the three routing policies are very close for higher level systems. Moreover, all of the travel times in configuration 5×10 are the lowest. Hence, it is reasonable to deduce that there exists an optimal ratio between the number of levels and the number of pick-columns in terms of the minimization of total travel time of the pickers for such systems. Fig. 11exhibits the effect of various ratios of the vertical travel rate (wr/vv) to the horizontal travel rate (hr/vh) on total travel time. As expected, the travel time reveals a convex relationship with warehouse configurations for all of the three routing polices. This implies that an optimal warehouse configuration exists in the high-level system under a certain ratio of (hr/vh) to (wr/vv) and can be found by the proposed evaluation model. Fig. 11(a) shows the optimal warehouse configuration is 2×25. As the ratio of (hr/vh) to (wr/vv) increases, the optimal warehouse configuration tends to get higher, as illustrated in Fig. 11a–c. The results indicate that the vertical movement speed of pickers may need to increase to improve the performance for high-level picker-to-part systems.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The design alternatives of warehouse configurations and operations can be evaluated quickly by a performance evaluation criterion. Previous studies pointed out that the travel time is a waste. Thus, many travel time or distance evaluation models have been developed to estimate the performance of picking operations. However, there have been only a few studies that discuss the high-level order picking systems. The purpose of this study is to propose a quantifiable estimation model on the travel time of a picker in a high-level picker-to-part system that adopts traversal, return or midpoint policies based on the class-based item assignment. The performance of the proposed evaluation model is validated with the results of a simulation model. The results of the simulation experiment conducted validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. Moreover, the proposed model can determine the optimal warehouse specification in order to reduce travel time according to the routing and storage assignment policies.Finally, two issues can be considered for future research. First, this paper assumes that a picker starts to pick the items in an order from the bottommost or the topmost rack in a pick-column. This assumption can be relaxed to study the impact of other picking modes. The other issue not discussed in this study is aisle congestion. In general, many pickers frequently work concurrently in the same region. As congestion may occur in such a multi-picker system, waiting time must be taken into account together with travel time and distance when evaluates the efficiency of picking operations. The proposed travel time evaluation model can be extended to investigate these two issues.
