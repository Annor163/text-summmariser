The functional landscape bound to the transcription factors of Escherichia coli K-12

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
DNA-binding transcription factors were searched in the complete genome of Escherichia coli K-12 by sequence comparisons.TFs deposited in RegulonDB were used as seeds to identify hypothetical TFs.Duplication events increase the size of the regulatory network in this bacterium.Potential target genes were predicted to uncharacterized TFs.Probable regulatory interactions were identified between well-known and uncharacterized TFs.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Motivated by the experimental evidences accumulated in the last ten years and based on information deposited in RegulonDB, literature look up, and sequence analysis, we analyze the repertoire of 304 DNA-binding Transcription factors (TFs) in Escherichia coli K-12. These regulators were grouped in 78 evolutionary families and are regulating almost half of the total genes in this bacterium. In structural terms, 60% of TFs are composed by two-domains, 30% are monodomain, and 10% three- and four-structural domains. As previously noticed, the most abundant DNA-binding domain corresponds to the winged helix-turn-helix, with few alternative DNA-binding structures, resembling the hypothesis of successful protein structures with the emergence of new ones at low scales. In summary, we identified and described the characteristics associated to the DNA-binding TF in E. coli K-12. We also identified twelve functional modules based on a co-regulated gene matrix. Finally, diverse regulons were predicted based on direct associations between the TFs and potential regulated genes. This analysis should increase our knowledge about the gene regulation in the bacterium E. coli K-12, and provide more additional clues for comprehensive modelling of transcriptional regulatory networks in other bacteria.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655 represents one of the most important model organisms in biology. Its chromosome is composed of a 4.6 MB circular, negatively supercoiled DNA molecule that contains 4319 genes. An important element associated with gene expression in this bacterium corresponds to DNA-binding Transcription Factors (TFs). These proteins provide E. coli the ability to contend against environmental changes, by blocking (negative regulation) or allowing (positive regulation) the access of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters, depending on the operator context and ligand-binding status (Martinez-Antonio et al., 2006; Miroslavova and Busby, 2006; Wall et al., 2004). Previous analyses identified around 300 TFs that could regulate gene expression in this bacterium (Perez-Rueda and Collado-Vides, 2000; Madan Babu and Teichmann, 2003). Recently, around 180 well experimentally characterized TFs have been deposited in RegulonDB, a specialized database devoted to gene regulation in E. coli K-12 (Gama-Castro et al., 2008, 2011). Therefore, diverse questions associated to the repertoire of TFs arise, such as: how many new TFs can be identified by computational methods, ten years after the first attempt at describing the complete set of TFs in this bacterium? How many genes are regulated by these TFs? And how many genes could be associated with alternative regulatory mechanisms?In order to identify new regulatory proteins in E. coli K-12 and to elucidate the diverse regulatory functions associated to hypothetical TFs, structural and functional analyses were performed in this organism. We found a total of 304 TFs that could be regulating, around 50% of the total genes in this bacterium. We identified eight functional modules and new putative regulons; and finally, we describe a global perspective of the functional and evolutionary role of these TFs.
