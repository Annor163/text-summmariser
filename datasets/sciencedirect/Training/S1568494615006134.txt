@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic method to solve knowledge management performance evaluation (KMPE) problems. This method includes an integrated evaluation process starting from the measurement to the output of KMPE and combines subjective and objective indicators together. Firstly, we established an index system, involving the process of knowledge management, the organizational knowledge structure, economic benefits and efficiency. And based on this index system, a synthetic evaluation method is presented, using triangular fuzzy number to measure indexes and facilitating the KMPE with a group support system (GSS). To know better of the proposed method, we have an example to illustrate. Finally, the empirical study conducted in this paper indicates that the evaluation method has strong practicability and operability. Besides, the evaluation is enabled by using a group support system: the more objective scoring can be achieved due to synchronic/asynchronous and anonymous participation; Decision-makers improve their efficiency by the clear demonstration analysis results. The systematic method of KMPE based on the index system is able to improve organizations’ efficiency in performance evaluation process.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, knowledge management (KM) has been highly valued in academia and business circles. Jing et al. [23] defined KM in academia as any systematic activity related to support and enhancement of the creation of scientific knowledge and achievement of research goals. And the goal of KM is to enhance the performance of an organization and its profitability. Effective KM is one of great values for an industry or a company to acquire and maintain its competitive advantages [18]. Nowadays, KM is rapidly becoming an integral business activity for organizations as they realize that competitiveness pivots around the effective knowledge management [17,25]. The implementation of knowledge management systems has long been emphasized to support, augment or automate decision making [19]. Meanwhile, Knowledge management performance evaluation (KMPE), as an indispensable part in KM, has crucial effects in the goal of improving organizations’ performance. Many researches have been done on KMPE. Stary [8] achieved fully intertwined knowledge and business processing in processes management and studied the systems of differentiation and innovation by knowledge management (KM) and life cycles models. Ahn and Chang [1] studied KMPE by analyzing the relationship among knowledge, products, process and performance. Fairchild [13] evaluated knowledge management performance (KMP) using balance score card. Tiwana [49] discussed KMPE in the perspective of customer knowledge management. Wang and Chang [50] proposed an analytic hierarchical prediction model based on the reciprocal consistent additive fuzzy preference relations to help organizations become aware of the essential factors affecting the KM implementation.These researches have profound impacts on the promotion of developing and perfecting KMPE. However, they do not provide a methodology for performance evaluation in a systematic way. Most of them only concern the evaluation methodology by searching for an optimal solution without putting it into a continuous process. In other words, there is a need to establish a well-integrated system to enable the implementation of the evaluation methods. Although, some of research literature on decision making problem using Fuzzy method to solve: Li et al. [33] proposed a new multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method combining quality function deployment (QFD) with technique for order preference to evaluate and select of KMS from the user's perspective. Kuo and Liang [34] proposed a new performance evaluation method for tackling fuzzy multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems based on combining VIKOR and interval-valued fuzzy sets. Actually, Chua et al. [45] had studied the solvation of group decision-making evaluation problem by using fuzzy environment in 2007. However, the research on the knowledge management performance evaluation aspect based on the application of fuzzy is insufficient. Only Patil and Kant [44] proposes a prediction framework based on the fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) for KM adoption in SC. Therefore, in this paper, based on previous works and nowadays business sets [32], we will propose a synthetic method which uses triangular fuzzy numbers to evaluate the performance and a group support system (GSS) to facilitate the practice. It is easy to apply to a company, and is useful for company managers to take corresponding actions to improve KMP.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish an index system for KMPE. While based on this evaluate index system, we propose an evaluation method using triangular fuzzy numbers in Section 3 and propose a GSS to facilitate members who relate to a company to take part in the real-time evaluation process. Section 4 describes the synthetic method for KMPE and Section 5 illustrates the application of our method to an empirical study and discusses the value of this method. Finally, we give some discussions and present our conclusions.Based on references and practices of KM, we propose an index system of KMP in this section, which includes four components, i.e., the KM process, the organizational knowledge structure, economic benefits and efficiency. Brief descriptions of these four components are shown as follows.KM activities result in knowledge circulation processes; there are five components: creation, accumulation, sharing, utilization and internalization of knowledge [26], while Eppler and Sukowski [12] have defined four core processes for knowledge management, namely a team knowledge assessment or audit, team knowledge development (creation and acquisition of new knowledge), mutual briefings and updates, and systematic reviews or lessons learned sessions. Lindner and Wald [29] tested the influence of culture, organizational, structural and process-related factors on KM effectiveness by applying the partial least square method. With regard to references above, we define acquisition, transfer and creation of knowledge as three key activities for knowledge management process. Maria [31] constructed and applied a model of collaborative knowledge management process (CKMP) to draw on current developments in the knowledge creation theory of knowledge management (KM) and taking the collaborative learning approach (CLA).Specifically, knowledge acquisition includes the ability to obtain and refine knowledge utilizing resource materials and Internet. Knowledge transfer includes explicit knowledge transfer and tacit knowledge transfer. A crucial and difficult step in the organizational knowledge process is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.It is important to understand if the development of knowledge resources and the implementation of knowledge management initiatives can direct and indirect explore the knowledge creation, which was defined by Nonaka and Takeushi [37] as the ability of an institute to create and circulate knowledge in the organization, products, services and systems. While Jader and Dai [21] believed that knowledge management creation is a concept comprising six dimensions acting as “knowledge creation accelerators”: absorptive capacity. Nonaka et al. [39] studied KM creation from an organizational perspective. They studied the dynamic process in which a company can create, maintain and exploit knowledge. According to above articles, we conclude knowledge creation as the efficiency of new products development, time efficiency to market and the degree of new knowledge application.The organizational knowledge structure is critical to KM. We define the organizational ability to use knowledge, the leadership of organization's manager, the ability of team members and the environment to support knowledge management as four aspects of organizational knowledge structure. They are described below respectively.Organizational skill to use knowledge is one of the major factors influencing organizational knowledge structure. In terms of the organizational skill, earlier studies [35,36,38,40,47] focus primarily on the impact of knowledge creation and codification. However, knowledge creation or codification alone does not necessarily lead to performance improvement or value creation [2]. Value is created only when knowledge is shared throughout an organization and applied to somewhere it is needed [16]. In addition, knowledge transfer capabilities play a significant role in an organization's knowledge acquisition process [4]. Therefore, we argue that the organizational skill to use knowledge should be evaluated from four aspects: the ability to learn knowledge, the wish to knowledge creation, knowledge conversion efficiency and measures taking to bridge the knowledge gap.The leadership of managers is another important factor in KMP. Powering leadership is positively related to both knowledge sharing and team efficacy, which, in turn, were both positively related to knowledge management performance [48]. The core competencies for effective leaders of knowledge-intensive organizations are acting as a catalyst, being a coordinator, exercising control, and being an evaluator [20]. The leadership for knowledge manager includes the ability to lead, manage and make decisions.The ability of team members and the environment to support KM are both factors in organizational knowledge structure. The degree of trust, communication and coordination of social interaction are positively related to KM [9]. Whereas organizational environment is formed by individual, and stronger individual capability has great impact on improving the KMP. Individuals are motivated by various goals and purposes in conducting activities [53]. The indexes we define for the ability of team members are the initiative on knowledge comprehension and creation, communication, expression, and problem-solving abilities. Indexes for environment to support KM are the level of digitization and network and the stability of knowledge network.Holsapple and Joshi [20] pointed out that financial resources put a ceiling on what can be expended on knowledge activities. Increasing financial resources available for a knowledge activity (e.g. acquiring some needed knowledge) may affect the efficiency of that activity or the quality of its results (positively or negatively). Financial performance is one of the most direct reactions of KM performance. Financial changes embody the condition of the KM in an organization to some extent. Moreover, they may have influence on the execution of leadership, control, quality of employee's work, and even the organizational environment. In an index system established by Lee et al. [26], financial indicators such as stock price, R&D expenditure and PER are evident indexes related to knowledge management performance. We therefore consider several main factors in terms of the influence of KM on finance: profit level, average income level and social value performance (including share price and tax payment).Successful KM will improve efficiency in all aspects of the organization. Knowledge management systems support processes by which individuals make use of other knowledge [43]. When tacit knowledge is acquired by individuals through learning and experience, it leads to improvements on employee's efficiency. Meantime, employee's efficiency positively relates to KMP. Other indicators of efficiency improvements including changes of the numbers of customers, customer satisfaction rate, employee satisfaction rate and the yield on knowledge property rights transfer.Table 1summarizes the four categories of indexes of evaluating knowledge management performance identified above.We cluster these indexes into two general types: objective indexes and subjective indexes. The objective indexes are determined by concrete data such as selling profit and share price etc. The subjective indexes’ ratings are according to questionnaire-based interviews with relevant people.The descriptions of the indexes are shown in Table 1.When assigning scores to each index, two factors must be taken into account [7]: the subjectivity inherent in humanity's judgments and the method chosen to aggregate individual scores. Assigning scores to indexes is a process of multi-attribute group decision-making, in which difficulties always exist when integrating different opinions from different individuals at different time. Aiming at group decision-making problems based on language estimation information, existing methods can be generally classified into two categories: (1) the methods to design symbol-transfer of language operators and (2) the methods to transfer linguistic assessment information into fuzzy numbers, and then compute and analyze these fuzzy numbers according to extension rules. Triangular fuzzy number method used in this paper belongs to the latter category.Fan et al. [14] mentioned that knowledge rules are designed for the semi-structured or ill-structured problems in the grouping procedure, while Zadeh [54] proposed the concept of fuzzy sets in order to solve problems described semi-structured or ill-structured, which allows us to process and transform imprecise information effectively and flexibly. Because of the uncertainty of objective things and the fuzziness of human thought, fuzzy decision making based on fuzzy sets theory has become a basic method for decision making, meanwhile triangular fuzzy numbers or fuzzy linguistic have been extensively applied in fuzzy control and fuzzy decision-making [3,5,6]. Xu and Hu [51] introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers or interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to attribute decision-making problems. Yu and Shunshun [10] used social network analysis to research on the development of Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set. Ebrahimnejad et al. [46] adopt fuzzy environment proposes a new two-phase group decision making (GDM) approach for construction project problem. Chen et al. [22] proposed a teaching performance evaluation approach based on the combination of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method.Some basic definitions of triangular fuzzy numbers are reviewed:1. A fuzzy set A in R (R stands for all real numbers) is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function FA(x) which associates with each point in R a real number in the interval [0,1], with the value of FA(x) at x representing the “grade of membership” of x in A. Thus, the nearer the value of FA(x) to unity, the higher the grade of membership of x in A[54,55].FA(x)=0,x≤a,lF(x),a<x≤b,l,b<x≤c,rF(x),c<x≤d,0,d<xwhere lFis nondecreasing function and rFis nonincreasing function. The functions lFand rFare also called the left and right side of fuzzy number F.We assume that∫−∞+∞FA(x)dx<+∞.2. A fuzzy number A is called a triangular fuzzy number if its membership function FA(x) has the following form [55]:FA(x)=0,x≤b−αx−b+αα,b−α<x<b1,x=bb+β−xβ,b<x≤b+β0,b+β<xwhere parameters α and β are positive real numbers, and are called left and right width. Using the notation in [11], we write FA=(b−α, b, b+β), where parameters α and β are nonnegative real numbers and (b−α) presents the lower value, b is the middle one and (b+β) presents the upper value of FA.Thus, experts and customers can evaluate each index using the pre-designed language comments set, such as “VL” for “very low” for “ability to obtain and correct knowledge”, and then the triangular fuzzy number corresponding to the index and its weight can be obtained. For example, if VL is for the weight and VP is for the index, then the triangular fuzzy number is (0, 0, 0.1). Every expert and customer can evaluate KM according to preference. However, triangular fuzzy number is just a method to solve the problem, and we also need a system to perform and support this method. Therefore, we put forward the group support system to achieve our aim.The aggregation of individual evaluations into a group evaluation is a key issue in decision theory [52]. A group support system (GSS) is intended to support and structure group interactions, including information sharing, planning, problem solving, decision making and conflict resolution. GSS automate group meetings, providing group members with computer workstations, software tools and procedures that allow them to enter their ideas, comments, and evaluations and view those of others [15].For a company or an organization, information for its KMP may be needed at any time, so surveys aimed at KMP investigation are needed constantly and randomly. It is necessary to develop a GSS to deal with these multi-period and multi-attribute decision making problems.The principal advantages of GSS include [41]: (1) parallel communication, which promotes broader input into the meeting process and reduces the chance that only a few people will dominate the meeting; (2) anonymous input, which mitigates evaluation apprehension and conformance pressure so that issues are discussed candidly; (3) process support and structure, which helps to focus the group on key issues and to discourage irrelevant digressions and unproductive behaviors; and (4) task support and structure, which provides information and approaches to analyze it.In this paper, a distributed GSS is required to solve the problem that participants are from different places and in different time. The GSS will help visualize the changes after utilizing KM by displaying curve graphs and diagrams of data from different periods, and it will help give some suggestions about continual improvement.Suppose the time set is F={F1, F2, …, Fn}; the index set is C={C1, C2, …, Cn}, then the problem about KMPE can be expressed as follows: by sorting the results of knowledge management performance from all periods in period set F, comparisons between different periods can be obtained.The information required in evaluation problems is as follows: index weight vectorw˜=(w˜1,w˜2,…,w˜n)and evaluation matrixX˜=[x˜ij]m×n, wherew˜jstands for the weight of index Cj, andx˜ijstands for the score of the index Cjin period Fi.Index weightw˜jand evaluation scorex˜ijof the first two categories indexes in Table 1 can be obtained in the form of linguistic variables by experts using the pre-designed language comment set in Table 2. Then we can transfer the linguistic variables into triangular fuzzy numbers. As for the last two categories of indexes in Table 1,x˜ijcan be obtained in the form of numerical value by company's concrete financial data. Usually, numerical value can also be expressed with triangular fuzzy numbers. For example, 15 is (15, 15, 15).Next, we will propose a synthetic method that extends the methods in [27,28,42]; Liou and Wang [30] and brings forth new ideas about combining an evaluation method with a real-time GSS. Fig. 1shows the flowchart about the process followed by detailed description of each step. When a manager calls for the knowledge management evaluation process, some participants would evaluate the indexes by a system (GSS). During the evaluation, the system has to tell whether this participant is an expert, if it is then aggregate the index weight vectors; if it is not then aggregate the evaluation matrix. After that, the system could compute synthetic results and print out the results.Step1. Aggregate the index weight vectors and the evaluation matrix given by the experts.Suppose there are l experts (namely P1, P2, …, Pl) participating in KMPE (provided the importance of every expert equals), and the index weight vector given by expert Pkisw˜(k)=(w˜1(k),w˜2(k),…,w˜n(k))T. The evaluation matrix which consists of evaluation scores given by expert Pkand evaluation score numbers obtained by financial data isX˜(k)=[x˜ij(k)]m×n, wherew˜j(k)can be expressed with triangular fuzzy number asw˜j(k)=(aj(k),bj(k),cj(k)). ButX˜(k)has two situations: with regard to evaluation scores given by experts,X˜(k)can be expressed asx˜ij(k)=(eij(k),fij(k),gij(k)),j=1,2, …, h; as for numerical indexes obtained by financial data,X˜(k)can be expressed asx˜ij(k)=(eij(k*),fij(k*),gij(k*)),fij(k*)=gij(k*). j=h+1, h+2, …, n. Then we can aggregate all experts’ evaluation scores for the group's index weight vectorw˜=(w˜1,w˜2,…,w˜n)Tand the group's evaluation matrixX˜=[x˜ij]m×nwhere(1)w˜j=(1/l)⊗[w˜j(1)⊕w˜j(2)⊕…⊕w˜j(l)],j=1,2,…,n(2)w˜ij=(1/l)⊗[x˜ij(1)⊕x˜ij(2)⊕…⊕x˜ij(l)],i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,nwhere ⊕ and ⊗ respectively stands for add operation and multiply operation. According to extension principlew˜jandx˜jare still triangular fuzzy numbers,if writew˜j=(aj,bj,cj),x˜ij=(eij,fij,gij),then(3)ai=1l(∑k=1laj(k)),bj=1l(∑k=1lbj(k)),cj=1l(∑k=1lcj(k)),j=1,2,…,n(4a)eij=1l∑k=1lej(k),i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,heijk*i=1,2,…,m;j=h+1,h+2,…,n(4b)fij=1l∑k=1lfj(k),i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,hfijk*i=1,2,…,m;j=h+1,h+2,…,n(4c)gij=1l∑k=1lgj(k),i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,hgijk*i=1,2,…,m;j=h+1,h+2,…,nStep2. Construct standard evaluation matrix.In order to make different indexes comparable, evaluation matrixX˜=[x˜ij]m×nneeds to be standardized into standard evaluation matrixR˜=[r˜ij]m×n. Its computation formula is(5)r˜ij=(e′ij,f′ij,g′ij)=(eij/ejk*,fij/fjk*,gij/gjk*),i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,nwhereejk*=maxieij,fjk*=maxifij, g=maxigijStep3. Calculate the comprehensive evaluation valueRecord the fuzzy evaluation vector of KMP asu˜i=(u˜1,u˜2,…,u˜m)T, whereu˜istands for the evaluation score in period Fi, which can be obtained by the following formula:(6)u˜i=(x˜i1⊗w˜1)⊕(x˜i2⊗w˜2)⊕…⊕(x˜in⊗w˜n),i=1,2,…,m;According to extension principle,u˜iis a nonlinear fuzzy number, which in actual application is usually approximated as a triangular fuzzy number to simplify calculations, namelyu˜i≈αi,βi,γi, where(7)αi=1n∑j=1ne′ijajβi=1n∑j=1nf′ijbjαi=1n∑j=1ng′ijcji=1,2,…,mStep 4. Calculate the sorting results of comprehensive evaluation.u˜i(i=1,2,…,m)is a triangular fuzzy number, whose value is difficult to be calculated directly. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate its corresponding expected value (or arrangement value). Here we adopt the method in [24,30] to calculate the expected value of a triangular fuzzy number. Foru˜i=(αi,βi,γi), its membership function is(8)fu˜i(x)=0,x<αix−αiβi−αi,αi≤x≤βix−γiβi−γi,βi≤x≤γi0,γi<x,i=1,2,…,mThe inverse functions of its left membership functionfu˜iL(x)=(x−αi)/(βi−αi)and its right membership functionfu˜iR(x)=(x−γi)/(βi−γi)are respectivelyϕu˜iL(y)=αi+(βi−αi)yandϕu˜iR(y)=γi+(βi−γi)y, which are both continuous, and are strictly increasing and strictly decreasing respectively at interval [0,1]. Then, the left expected value and right expected value ofu˜iare(9)IL(u˜i)=∫01ϕu˜iL(y)dy=∫01[α1+(βi−αi)y]dy=αi+βi2,i=1,2,…,m(10)IR(u˜i)=∫01ϕu˜iR(y)dy=∫01[γi+(βi−γi)y]dy=βi+γi2,i=1,2,…,mIntegrating the left expected value and right expected value, we can calculate the expected value ofu˜i, namely(11)I(u˜i)=ηI(u˜i)+(1−η)IR(u˜i),0≤η≤1,i=1,2,…,mwhere η stands for optimistic-pessimistic coefficient, if η>0.5, it indicates that the decision maker is pessimistic; if η=0.5, it indicates the decision maker is neutral; if η>0.5, it indicates that the decision maker is optimistic. Usually, it may take η=0.5 [30] when it is hard to define a decision maker's optimistic–pessimistic coefficient. Thus, the expected value is(12)I(u˜i)=αi+2βi+γi4,i=1,2,…,mwhereI(u˜i)can be seen as sorting value. The larger the value is, the larger the corresponding evaluation scoreu˜iis, and the better the KMP in period Fiis.Step5. Draw the diagram of KMP resultsAccording to sorting valueI(u˜i), we can draw a diagram which visualizes the KMP results in all the periods within an evaluation cycle. The diagram can display the dynamic situation of KMP. By evaluating KMP in the same period within a comparatively long cycle, an organization can find out inadequacies in the process of KM, and make some adjustments about KM.The above steps form a practical overall process and for evaluating the KMP. To test its applicability, we apply the method and process in a case and describe it below.In this paper, we apply our KMPE method proposed in Section 4.1 to a company by intercepting a part of the calculating process. During the main knowledge evaluation process of this company, we select 5 subjective and 3 objective indexes which are representative in this industry and define three different time periods (F1, F2, F3), in which three KM experts (P1, P2, P3) scored 5 subjective indexes (Table 1): The ability to use stored knowledge and Internet resource (C1), tacit knowledge transfer level (C2), the efficiency of new products development (C3), organizational skills (C4), decision-making capacity (C5) and 3 objective indexes: selling profits (C6), share price (C7) and the amount of customers (C8).The weight vectors given by the experts are listed in Table 3. The evaluation matrix consists of linguistic evaluation results of subjective indexes and concrete data of objective indexes are shown in Table 4.According to the correspondence between linguistic variables and triangular fuzzy numbers, as shown in Table 2, we can convert the linguistic variables in Tables 3 and 4 into triangular fuzzy numbers. Then by using the above formulas, we can work out the sorting results and the synthetic evaluation results of the 3 months with different values of η, as shown in Table 5. The sorting results with η=0 and η=1 are respectively vectors formed by left expected value and right expected value of each month.In this section, we would design a GSS based on our method to trace the changes and the status of KMP to improve the performance. The GSS was designed by participants (including experts in the KM field) who were from both inside and outside the company. Firstly, participants scored every index which we proposed in Section 2, and then the GSS automatically calculated these data by triangular fuzzy numbers method present in the paper and displayed the analyzed results in GSS UI, which allows leaders to make corresponding adjustments of the weak links in the KM process. After that, we measured the effectiveness of our method, and proved the fact that it is effective and it indeed could improve the efficiency of KMPE of the company.A GSS would be helpful when calculating the sorting results and the synthetic evaluation results by triangular fuzzy numbers. Fig. 2shows how experts scored the indexes in the GSS. With their user names and passwords checked, the three KM experts were authorized to weigh and score every index. The table differs on different levels of authorities. For example, if the system user is an ordinary designer, (s)he cannot weigh the indexes. Given by the GSS, Fig. 3shows the synthetic evaluation results of KM when η=0.5. As is shown, this company had better consequences of KM in the second time period (the second quarter) than the first and the third time periods (quarters) of 2014. Thus, by implementing this synthetic method, we can easily find out the differences between the KM results in different time periods, and then find out the factors that may affect or obstruct the improvements of the KMP, and take correspondent measures to improve the KMP of companies.We applied this method to the company for real-time operation. Graphs reflect a gradual improvement in almost all aspects in spite of some tiny fluctuations which may result from seasonal impacts or some other factors. In general, the company has made some adjustments, which have enhanced the efficiency of KM execution. By comparing the performance with and without using this method, it's proved to be efficient.To further understand the comparison between the performance before and after using our method, we launched an email-survey by issuing a questionnaire to all users. We invited a total amount of more than 200 users (including designers, managers, staffs and customers) to participate and guaranteed the confidentiality of their responses. The survey yielded 93 completed questionnaires (for a usable response rate of 46.5%), and we evaluated the reliability and validity of the data. Responses are given as in Table 6.Fig. 4shows the statistical result from all respondents. As can be seen, this company's KMP has been improved in all aspects than before. Specifically, the effect of this systematic method has the highest score, indicating that the friendly GSS UI facilitates the managers to make decisions, thus indirectly lead to the improvement of the entire process of KM.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Since existing studies have seldom focused on a systematic application of KPME method, this study fills the void by combining the evaluation method with a concrete application solution. The evaluation method proposed in this paper has strong practicability and operability. It's proved to be effective to compare and evaluate the indexes system by converting linguistic variables into triangular fuzzy numbers. Besides, fast and real time evaluation is enabled by using the GSS: more objective scoring can be achieved due to synchronic/asynchronous and anonymous participation; decision-makers’ efficiency is improved due to the clear demonstration analysis results. The implementation of our method is used not only for measuring KMP by evaluating indexes, but also for the entire chain of KM process including scoring, calculating, summarizing and decision-making.However, KMPE is a broad topic involving many complex factors. The study conducted in this paper is just an attempt to explore KMPE in a real situation of nowadays business environment, and further improvements are needed.
