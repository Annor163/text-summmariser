@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study the optimal production planning for an assembly system consisting of n components in a single period setting. Demand for the end-product is random and production and assembly capacities are uncertain due to unexpected breakdowns, repairs and reworks, etc. The cost-minimizing firm (she) plans components production before the production capacities are realized, and after the outputs of components are observed, she decides the assembly amount before the demand realization. We start with a simplified system of selling two complementary products without an assembly stage and find that the firm's best choices can only be: (a) producing no products or producing only the product of less stock such that its target amount is not higher than the other product's initial stock level, or (b) producing both products such that their target amounts are equal. Leveraging on these findings, the two-dimensional optimization problem is reduced to two single-dimensional sub-problems and the optimal solution is characterized. For a general assembly system with n components, we show that if initially the firm has more end-products than a certain level, she will neither produce any component nor assemble end-product; if she does not have that many end-products but does have enough mated components, she will produce nothing and assemble up to that level; otherwise she will try to assemble all mated components and plan production of components accordingly. We characterize the structure of optimal solutions and find the solutions analytically.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In manufacturing, capacity can be uncertain due to factors such as unexpected breakdowns of unreliable machinery, unplanned maintenance of uncertain duration, rework of randomly defective items etc. (Ciarallo, Akella & Morton 1994, Hu, Duenyas & Kapuscinski 2008). Such uncertainties complicate production planning in that the output is not necessarily equal to the planned amount. The effect of uncertain capacities on production planning in serial systems has been investigated (see e.g., Hwang & Singh 1998, Wang & Gerchak 1996a); however, little is known for assembly systems which happen to be more prevalent in modern manufacturing.We study optimal production planning in a single period setting for an assembly system where demand for the end-product is random and all components production and end-product assembly capacities are uncertain. Given abundant input, each item's (components and the end-product) output is random and equal to the minimum of its planned amount and the realization of its uncertain capacity. The firm chooses production amounts of components before production capacities are realized, and after outputs of components are observed, she decides the planned assembly amount before realization of the assembly capacity and demand. Unmet demand incurs penalty cost while unused items result in disposal costs. Production and assembly costs are charged based on outputs of components and the end-product, respectively.A direct motivation of our paper comes from a problem faced by cell phone producers in China. In the highly-competitive cell phone market, all competitors strive to introduce new products quite frequently to stimulate demand and attract consumers. A producer's ability of having abundant new products ready for a coming selling season is a precondition for the success of her business. One of cell phone producers’ difficulties is that their components production suffers from uncertain capacities due to increased internal uncertainties arising from immature technologies, complex control and lack of production experience, etc. As a result, late deliveries of components may happen and firms lose not only sales but also valuable market shares. Nonetheless, firms are reluctant to use expensive mitigation measures such as stockpiling and backup capacity/supplier because margin is dropping throughout the industry. They need to plan their productions by taking into account not only random demand but also uncertain capacities. One may find cell phone producers’ story echoes in other competitive industries (e.g., innovative consumer electronics) where the end-products have short life-cycles. Our model presented here tries to address the production planning problems in such environments.We start with a system where the firm sells two perfectly complementary products as a set to the market. This corresponds to a two-component system where assembly is unnecessary. We show that the optimal production plan can only be: (a) producing no products at all or producing only the product of less stock such that its target amount is at most as high as the other product's initial stock level, or (b) producing both products such that their target amounts are equal. We then use these facts to reduce the two-dimensional optimization problem into two interconnected one-dimensional sub-problems that are analytically tractable. Each sub-problem is solved and the optimal solution to the original problem is then fully characterized. We then extend the model to consider a general assembly system with n components where the firm engages in two-stage decision-making (components production planning in stage 1 and end-product assembly planning in stage 2) with uncertain production and assembly capacities. We find that if the initial stock of end-product is lower than a certain level, she will act in an assemble-as-many-as-possible fashion in stage 2 and will choose components’ planned amounts accordingly in stage 1. Otherwise, she will neither assemble any end-product nor produce any components. When producing is necessary for some or all components, we fully characterize the optimal solution.This research is closely related to the literature on production/inventory systems under uncertain capacities. In the seminal work of Ciarallo et al. (1994), they show that for a single-stage, single-item system with uncertain capacity and random demand, an order-up-to policy is optimal for a periodic review finite-horizon problem, and a so-called “extended myopic” policy(which requires the consideration of review periods of uncertain length) is optimal for the infinite horizon problem. For the same system, Güllü (1998) presents a procedure for computing the optimal base stock level under expected average cost per period criterion, while Iida (2002) extends the model to consider non-stationary demand and develops upper and lower bounds of optimal policies for infinite horizon problems. Wang and Gerchak (1996a) consider uncertain capacity as well as random yield and show that the optimal policy is of a reorder-point type. Erdem and Özekici (2002) develop a rather general periodic-review model that incorporates both uncertain capacity and random environment which is a time-homogeneous Markov chain. They show that the optimal policy is the well-known base-stock policy where the optimal order-up-to level depends on the state of the environment. For a single-period multi-stage system with setup costs and uncertain capacities at all stages, Hwang and Singh (1998) prove that the optimal policy is characterized by a sequence of imbedded critical numbers. Hu et al. (2008) address the optimal joint control of inventory and transshipment for a firm that produces in two locations whose capacities are uncertain. Under Markovian production capacity, Yang, Qi and Xia (2005) study the optimal inventory-outsourcing policy while Yang, Qi and Xia (2006) study inventory control with an option of order rejection. Under the EOQ framework, Wang and Gerchak (1996b) analyze the effects of uncertain capacity on optimal lot sizing with single supplier while Erdem, Fadiloglu and Özekici (2006) consider multiple suppliers. From a strategic point of view, in a single period setting, Wang, Gilland and Tomlin (2010) examine which mitigation strategy, dual sourcing or process improvement, is favorable for a firm facing uncertain capacity or random yield as supplier cost/reliability varies.The above-mentioned papers are mainly about serial systems, little is known about the optimal policies for assembly systems with uncertain capacities. Bollapragada, Rao and Zhang (2004) study an assembly system with uncertain capacities at component stage, but their system is assumed to be operating under a periodic-review installation base-stock policy, and their goal is to minimize the total steady-state surrogate holding cost subject to a service level constraint. We, on the other hand, aim to fully characterize the optimal solution for the system. Xiao, Chen and Lee (2010) is another paper on assembly systems with uncertain capacity, but the uncertainty lies in only the assembly stage. In our system, both the component production capacities and assembly capacity can be uncertain. Recently, Bollapragada, Kuppusamy and Rao (2015) numerically illustrate the impacts of lead times and capacity on the performance of a complicated assembly system with supply uncertainty. However, no optimal policies or behaviors are provided.In a broader sense, our paper is also related to research on production/inventory decisions in assembly systems with random yield (another common internal cause for random output besides uncertain capacity). In his seminal work, Yao (1988) applies a chance-constrained optimization approach to minimize the cost of procuring components subject to a given probability of achieving a fixed target yield on the assembly stage. Gurnani, Akella and Lehoczky (2000) extend Yao's model to optimize components ordering and assembly target level decisions simultaneously under random demand. Gerchak, Wang and Yano (1994) address lot sizing decisions in assembly systems with random yield both at component stage and assembly stage, they prove that the cost functions are jointly concave under certain circumstances and the optimal lot sizes are then given by the first order conditions. Pan and So (2010) study joint pricing-production decisions in a two-component assembly system where one of the components faces random yield. All of these papers are conducted in a single-period setting except for DeCroix (2013), in which the optimal policies for an assembly system subject to supply disruptions (considered as a special “all-or-nothing” case of random yield) are characterized.In these random yield models, the optimal solutions are about “inflating the planned production amounts”. Moreover, the targeted amounts (equal to planned amount plus initial inventory) of the complementary components are generally not equal. These are not true in our uncertain capacity model. We found that in assembly systems with uncertain capacities, the optimal solutions are about “deflation” rather than “inflation” of the planned production quality. That is, the planned amounts under uncertain capacities are generally smaller than those under unlimited capacities. Moreover, a wise decision-maker will plan production such that the targeted amounts of different components are equal. The key to such differences is that capacity uncertainty implies that output is the minimum of the planned amount and the realized capacity while yield randomness often implies that output is stochastically proportionate to the planned amount.The paper is organized as follows. For ease of exposition, we start in Section 2 with a simple system where the firm produces and sells two complementary products as a set to the market. We then extend our model in Section 3 by considering a general assembly system where the firm needs to plan components production amounts and assembly amount sequentially with uncertain production and assembly capacities. Concluding remarks are given in Section 4. A symbol/notation table and all the detailed mathematical proofs are given in the appendixes.A firm produces and sells a set of two perfectly complementary products to the market in a selling season. Due to long lead time of manufacturing, the firm needs to plan production in advance. Without loss of generality, a set contains one unit of each product. The one-time demand Z is random with a differentiable CDF Q( · ) on support (0, ∞). The production capacity for product i, Ki,i=1,2, is uncertain due to unexpected breakdowns, repairs, and reworks, etc. Assume that Kiis independent of production plan and its CDF Fi( · ) is differentiable and has support on (0, ∞). Moreover, Ki,i=1,2, are mutually independent. (Assuming correlation of uncertain production capacities complicates the analyses without adding much insight into the solution structure of the problem.) As a result, the firm plans to produce uiunits of productibut will only receiveui∧Ki:=min{ui,Ki}units of finished products. Plus her initial inventory of product i, xi, the available amount of product i isAi:=ui∧Ki+xi, and hence, the available amount of sets is A1∧A2. For any CDF G( · ), defineG¯(·):=1−G(·). Note that for the rest of the paper, when we say “produce/assemble u units”, we actually mean “plan to produce/assemble u units”.Following the literature (Ciarallo et al. 1994), assume that only executed production bears cost, i.e., product i’s production cost is ci(ui∧Ki), where ciis the corresponding unit cost. Let hibe the unit disposal cost of unused product i. Assume thatci>−hi, that is, the salvage value (if hi≤ 0) of a product is less than its production cost. Let b be the unit penalty cost of unmet demand, and assume thatb>c1+c2, which is reasonable since the value of a set should be higher than its total production cost. The firm's problem is to choose ui,i=1,2, before capacities and demand are realized, so as to minimize her expected total cost. Note that a list of symbols and notations used throughout the paper is provided in Appendix A.Letu:=(u1,u2)be the production decision vector andx:=(x1,x2)the initial inventory vector. The expected cost function is(1)Π(u)=E[(h1+h2)(A1∧A2−Z)++b(Z−A1∧A2)++∑i=12(hi(Ai−A1∧A2)+ci(ui∧Ki))]wherex+=max{x,0}, and the expectation is taken over Fi( · ),i=1,2, and Q( · ), the cumulative distribution functions of Kiand Z, respectively. On the right hand side, the first term is disposal cost of mated but not sold sets of products, the second is the penalty cost of unmet demand, and the third is disposal cost of unmated products, while the last is production cost. The firm's problem can then be formalized asP:minuΠ(u)s.t.ui≥0,i=1,2.LetΔi:=ui+xi≥xi,i=1,2, be the firm's target amount of product i. Then, the available amount of product i can be written asAi=Δi∧(Ki+xi). Choosinguis equivalent to choosingΔ:=(Δ1,Δ2). For ease of exposition, we will use eitheruorΔ, whichever is convenient, to denote the decision variables. Without loss of generosity, assume x1 ≤ x2 throughout – the case of x1 ≥ x2 will be symmetrical. We first introduce a lemma that will help simplify the problem to a great extent.Lemma 1The firm's best choices can only be: (a) producing no products at all or producing only product1 such that its target amount is at most as high as product 2’s initial stock level, or (b) producing both products such that their target amounts are equal. In other words, the optimal solutionu*, or equivalently,Δ*, toPsatisfies either (a)Δ2*=x2≥Δ1*≥x1or (b)Δ1*=Δ2*≥x2.As shown in Fig. 1, Lemma 1 indicates that, in the solution space, the optimal point can only be: (a) lying on the thick segment of the horizontal axis (i.e., from the original point (x1, x2) to point (x2, x2)) or (b) lying on the thick lineΔ1=Δ2≥x2. Suppose otherwise, the optimal point lies in zone Δ1 < x2 < Δ2, or zone x2 < Δ1 < Δ2, the firm can always be better off by lowering u2 (equivalently, Δ2) a little bit because the expected amount of mated components will be the same while some production cost can be saved, which results in contradiction. Likewise, suppose the optimal point lies in zone x2 < Δ2 < Δ1, the firm can always be better off by lowering u1 (equivalently, Δ1), which also results in contradiction.Case (a) of Lemma 1 corresponds to the situation where the firm already has abundant product 2 and/or product 1’s capacity is stochastically low, while in case (b), both products’ initial stock levels are not high enough and/or the firm's capacities are stochastically high enough, so the firm should produce both products and try to avoid mismatch by planning equal target amounts of them.Based on Lemma 1, suppose the optimal solution satisfies (a)Δ2*=x2≥Δ1*≥x1, or (b)Δ1*=Δ2*≥x2. We try to locate the potential optimal solutions in these two cases by solving two sub-problems ofP. And then we build the links between the potential optimal solutions and finally identify the global optimum.Suppose it is optimal to produce no products or only product 1 such that its target amount is at most as high as product 2’s initial stock level. To find this potential optimal solution, substituteu2=0into (1) and restrictΔ1to be at most as high as x2, we have a single-dimensional objective function as(2)Π1(u1)=E[(h1+h2)(A1−Z)++b(Z−A1)++h2(x2−A1)+c1(u1∧K1)]where the available amount of sets is given as A1. The firm's sub-problem in this case isP1:minu1Π1(u1)s.t.0≤u1≤x2−x1,whose optimal solution is characterized by the following proposition.Proposition 1Π1(u1) is quasi-convex in u1and the optimal solutionu^11toP1 is(3)u^11={0,ifx1≥VV−x1,ifx1<V≤x2x2−x1,ifx2<VwhereV=Q−1[(b+h2−c1)/(b+h1+h2)].Proposition 1 presents us with a potential optimal solution which, in effect, is determined by a fractile of the demand distribution Q( · ). In other words, when producing only product 1 is optimal, the firm plans its production based solely on the demand distribution, while ignoring product 1’s uncertain capacity, which is a little unexpected. Note that in a single-item, single-period system with uncertain capacity, the optimal solution is also not affected by the capacity distribution (Ciarallo et al. 1994). We will show that capacity uncertainty plays an important role in shaping the optimal solution when the firm needs to produce both products. Notice that c2 has no effect on the value of V since no product 2 is produced in this case.Suppose it is optimal to produce both products such that their target amounts are equal. To find this potential optimal solution, substituteu2=Δ1−x2into (1) and restrictΔ1to be no less than x2, we have another single-dimensional objective function as(4)Π2(u1)=E[(h1+h2)(Δ1∧(K1+x1)∧(K2+x2)−Z)++b(Z−Δ1∧(K1+x1)∧(K2+x2))++∑i=12(hi(Δ1∧(Ki+xi)−Δ1∧(K1+x1)∧(K2+x2)))+c1(u1∧K1)+c2((Δ1−x2)∧K2)]whereΔ1∧(Ki+xi)is product i’s available amount andΔ1∧(K1+x1)∧(K2+x2)is the amount of mated products. The firm's sub-problem in this case isP2:minu1Π2(u1)s.t.u1≥x2−x1,whose optimal solution is provided in the following proposition.Proposition 2Π2(u1) is quasi-convex in u1and the optimal solutionu^12toP2is(5)u^12={x2−x1,ifL(x2−x1)>0,u^1,ifL(x2−x1)≤0.where(6)L(u1)=−(h1+h2+b)Q¯(Δ1)+h1+c1F¯2(Δ1−x2)+h2+c2F¯1(u1)andu^1, if applicable, is given byL(u^1)=0, and is finite and unique.Unlike the potential optimal solution given in Proposition 1, this one given above in Proposition 2 is greatly shaped by the capacity distributions. This is because when producing both products is necessary, the firm needs to take the uncertain capacities into account so as to better coordinate the planned amounts in order to avoid mismatch between the complementary products. The key is that the product complementarity grants one product's uncertain capacity a negative externality on the other product's production activity. When producing only one product is necessary, there is no coordination of planned amounts and the externalities disappear.Now that we have located the potential optimal solutionsu^11andu^12, we can characterize the global optimal solution as follows.Proposition 3The firm's optimal production planu* is(7)u*={(0,0),ifx1≥V(V−x1,0),ifx1<V≤x2,(x2−x1,0),ifx2−V<0<L(x2−x1),(u^1,u^1+x1−x2),ifL(x2−x1)≤0.or equivalently,(8)Δ*={(x1,x2),ifx1≥V(V,x2),ifx1<V≤x2,(x2,x2),ifx2−V<0<L(x2−x1),(Δ^1,Δ^1),ifL(x2−x1)≤0.whereΔ^1=u^1+x1.Note that from the definitions of V and L( · ), the criteria in (7) are mutually exclusive. In conjunction with Fig. 1, the first case in (8) corresponds to the original point, the second case corresponds to internal point of the thick segment of the horizontal axis, the third case corresponds to the point (x2, x2), and the fourth case corresponds to the internal point of the thick lineΔ1=Δ2≥x2. In other words, if there are already abundant sets (i.e.,x1≥V), do not produce; if there are already abundant product 2 (i.e.,x2≥V) but insufficient product 1 (i.e.,x1<V), produce only product 1 such that there may be V units of available set; if both products are not abundant (i.e.,x2<V), but planning more than x2 units of set is not appealing (i.e.,L(x2−x1)>0), the firm should be just fine with planning x2 units of set; otherwise if both the products are not abundant and planning more than x2 units of set is appealing (i.e.,L(x2−x1)≤0), the firm should plan more than x2 units of set until the marginal cost is zero (i.e.,L(u^1)=0).If initially there are equal amounts of both products (i.e.,x1=x2), (7) will degenerate into(9)u*={(0,0),ifx1≥V¯,(u^1,u^1),ifx1<V¯.whereV¯=Q−1[(b−c1−c2)/(b+h1+h2)]. That is, the firm will always plan equal amounts of both products. Moreover, compared with the case of unequal initial inventories, now she seems more unwilling to engage in production (i.e., given x1, x1 > V always impliesx1>V¯).Back to the general solution in Eq. (7), we can easily demonstrate the effects of parameters on the optimal solution, as summarized in Table 1.Intuitively, the firm tends to plan more production as penalty cost increases, while he/she tends to plan less as holding costs or production costs increase. When producing only component 1 is necessary (corresponds to second column), surely the production cost of component 2 is irrelevant, and the firm should plan more of component 1 as holding cost of component 2 increases, which is also intuitive.To better understand the effect of capacity uncertainties on the optimal solution, we examine changes in the firm's choice of which products to produce and the corresponding planned amounts as either capacity distribution is increased stochastically (this can be done through process improvement, preventive maintenance or simply investment in new production line). Note again that we have assumed that product 1’s initial stock level is lower than product 2’s.Definition 1A random variable with distributionG^(·)is said to be stochastically larger than another random variable with distribution G( · ) if ∀y,G(y)≥G^(y).Based on such definition and the optimal solution given in (7), we can easily reach the following corollaries as follows.Corollary 1If initially the firm has at least V (a fractile of demand distribution) units of product 2, that is, x2 ≥ V, her optimal choice is not affected by the uncertain capacities.Corollary 1 says that there exists a level V which is defined by the cost parameters and the demand distribution only, and if the initial amount of the more abundant product (product 2) is above this level, then the firm's optimal production plan is independent of both products’ capacities uncertainties. To understand this, we need to look at the effect of each product's capacity on its own production and the other product's production. For product 2’s uncertain capacity, it has no effect at all since product 2 is really abundant and no production of it is needed. For product 1’s uncertain capacity, obviously it has no effect on product 2’s zero production, but it sounds somewhat counterintuitive that it also has no effect on product 1’s positive production. In this case, the explanation is the same as in the single-item system (Ciarallo et al. 1994), “one simply has to hope that the capacity is sufficient to produce the optimal amount dictated by the demand and the costs in a single-period situation”. Based on Corollary 1, a production manager, knowing that there are initially at least V units of product 2, can plan production as if there is no capacity uncertainties and just hope that it will go as planned. In fact, when producing only one product (product 1) is necessary, the firm's optimal choice is not affected by the uncertain capacities.Corollary 2If initially the firm has less than V units of product 2, a stochastic increase in product 1’s capacity leads to an increase in the likelihood of the firm deciding to produce both products, but a stochastic increase in product 2’s capacity does not change this likelihood. That is, ifx2<V,L(x2−x1)≤0is more likely to be true if K1is stochastically larger, but is independent of K2.As can be seen from(6),L(x2−x1)is smaller if product 1’s capacity is stochastically larger (i.e.,F¯1(·)is generally bigger), and is independent of product 2’s capacity distributionF¯2(·). The intuition is that, when initially product 2 is not abundant (i.e., x2 < V), the firm will consider producing only product 1rather than both products because of one and only one reason: the bottleneck lies in product 1’sshortage and capacity, producing more product 2 can be a waste in this case. Therefore, only increasing product 1’s capacity instead of product 2’s capacity can possibly encourage the firm to produce both products. In other words, when the initial inventories of both products are low (i.e., x1 ≤ x2 < V), it would be better for a production manager who wants to raise output to increase the capacity of the product of less initial stock rather than the capacity of the product of more initial stock.Corollary 3When producing both products is necessary, a stochastic increase in either product's capacity leads to an equal increase in both products’ optimal target amounts. That is, ifL(x2−x1)≤0,u^1, or equivalentlyΔ^1, becomes higher if K1or K2is stochastically larger.Corollary 3 can be easily shown mathematically through Lemma 1 and L( · )’s monotonicity. Counterintuitively, it implies that increasing only one product's capacity not only would encourage the production manager to plan more of the product, but also would encourage him/her to plan more of another product whose capacity remains unchanged. Moreover, the increments in both products’ optimal planned amounts are equal. Note that in contrast to Corollary 1, Corollary 3 demonstrates the impact of uncertain capacities on the firm's optimal choices when both products should be produced. As stated before, the idea is that the firm needs to take the uncertain capacities into account so as to better coordinate the planned amounts in order to avoid mismatch between the complementary products when producing both products.We have studied systems of complementary products and assumed no assembly stage in last section. In this section, we consider a general assembly setting where the firm first plans components production before the uncertain production capacities are realized, then after production is executed and outputs are observed, she decides the amount of assembling the components into end-products before uncertain assembly capacity and random demand for the end-product are realized. That is, we have a two-stage problem. Production costs of components are accounted at the end of stage 1, while assembly costs, disposal costs and shortage penalty cost are accounted at the end of stage 2.As in Section 2, production capacity Kifor component i,i=1,…,n, is uncertain and has mutually independent CDF Fi( · ) on support (0, ∞). Let K0 be the uncertain assembly capacity, it has a differentiable CDF F0( · ) with support on (0, ∞). K0 is independent of the decision variables. Let x0 be the initial stock level of the end-product, c0 and h0 be its unit assembly cost and unit disposal cost respectively. The planned amount of assembling mated components is denoted as u0, henceΔ0=u0+x0is the target amount of the end-product. Choosing u0 is equivalent to choosing Δ0, and we will use both of them, whichever is convenient, to denote the assembly decision.Assume thatci>−hiso that the firm will not infinitely produce component i. Moreover, assume thath0+c0>∑i=1nhi>c0−b, that is, assembling an end-product requires substantial efforts (the first inequality), and the firm only assembles mated components into end-products in order to meet the demand (the second inequality). Without loss of generosity, assume that x1 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ xn. Other assumptions and notations in Section 2 are relevant unless otherwise stated.Working backward, given the component production planu=(u1,⋯,un)made in stage 1, obviously the firm must choose u0 in [0, miniai], where aiis the realization ofAi=ui∧Ki+xi(i.e., the amount of available component i) and miniaiis the realized amount of mated components. The firm's second-stage objective function is(10)π(u0|u)=E[h0(u0∧K0+x0−Z)++b(Z−u0∧K0−x0)++c0(u0∧K0)]+∑i=1nhi(ai−u0∧K0),0≤u0≤miniaiwhere the expectation is taken over K0 and Z. The best decision in stage 2 is given as follows.Proposition 4π(u0|u) is quasi-convex in u0and the firm's optimal decision in stage 2 is characterized by(11)u0*(u)={0,ifL0(0)>0u¯0*,ifL0(0)≤0≤L0(miniai)miniai,ifL0(miniai)<0whereL0(u0)=(h0+b)Q(Δ0)−b+c0−∑i=1nhiandu¯0*is given byL0(u¯0*)=0.We can show thatπ′(u0)=F¯0(u0)L0(u0). SinceF¯0(·)>0, π′(u0) has the same sign as L0(u0). Moreover, L0(u0) is increasing in u0, hence π(u0) is quasi-convex and (11) is a natural result. If L0(0) > 0 (i.e.,x0>Q−1[(b−c0+∑i=1nhi)/(h0+b)]), there is no need to assemble since initially there are abundant end-products. If L0(0) ≤ 0 ≤ L0(miniai), the firm needs more end-products and with enough mated components, she assembles up to that level. If L0(miniai) < 0, the firm needs more end-products but does not have enough mated components to assemble up to that level, she then just tries to assemble all mated components. Therefore, when L0(0) ≤ 0, the optimal solution can simply be written asu0*(u)=u¯0*∧miniai. Note that given the assumptions on the costs,u¯0*is finite and unique.Now back to stage 1, for a production planu, the firm's total cost function is(12)Π(u)=E[∑i=1nci(ui∧Ki)+π(u0*(u))]From (11), if L0(0) > 0, obviously it is optimal to produce no components in stage 1 because the firm will not assemble for sure in stage 2. Therefore, we should focus on the case of L0(0) ≤ 0. In this case, ifx1>u¯0*, thenxi>u¯0*fori=1,…,n, that is, the firm initially has enough mated components to meet her target assembly level, so she will produce nothing in stage 1 and will assembleu¯0*units of end-products in stage 2. So for the rest of analysis, to keep things interesting, let us assume that L0(0) ≤ 0 andx1≤u¯0*, and we have the following lemma.Lemma 2If L0(0) ≤ 0 andx1≤u¯0*, it is optimal for the firm to plan component production such that0≤ui≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,…,nin stage 1, and try to assemble all the mated components in stage 2.Note that in last subsection we have shown that the optimal assembly solution isu0*(u)=u¯0*∧miniaiwhen L0(0) ≤ 0. So havingu¯0*in mind, intuitively, it is meaningless for the firm to have more thanu¯0*units of componenti=1,…,nbecause the firm will need only at mostu¯0*units of component i in stage 2. In turn, there should beu0*(u)=miniai(i.e., the firm tries to assemble all the mated components in stage 2) because miniaiis always not bigger thanu¯0*as long asui≤(u¯0*−xi)+, fori=1,…,nandx1≤u¯0*.Based on Lemma 2, we can work with a modified total cost function where the firm plans to assemble all the mated components in stage 2, and the problem becomes(13)P:min0≤ui≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,⋯,nΠ(u)=E[∑i=1nci(ui∧Ki)+π(u0*(u))]We next show that there exists a lemma analogous to Lemma 1.Lemma 3The firm's best choices in stage 1 can only be: (a) producing no components at all or producing only components1,…,j, for somej∈{1,⋯,n−1}, such that their target amounts are equal and no higher than componentj+1’s initial stock level, (b) producing all components such that the target amounts of them are equal. In other words, the optimal solutionu*, or equivalently,Δ*, toPeither satisfies (a)xj≤Δ1*=⋯=Δj*≤xj+1for somej∈{1,…,n−1}, andΔl*=xlforl=j+1,…,n, or (b)Δ1*=⋯=Δn*≥xn.Note that when it is optimal for the firm to produce components1,…,j(i.e., case (a) in Lemma 3), there must bexj<u¯0*because otherwise there is no need to produce component j by Lemma 2. Likewise, when it is optimal to produce all components (i.e., case (b) in Lemma 3), there must bexn<u¯0*because otherwise there is no need to produce component n. As in the two-component system, we first try to locate the potential optimal solutions by assuming the optimal solution takes the form of case (a) or case (b) in Lemma 3, then we identify the global one later. We will also show that the constraintsui≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,…,nare never binding unless(u¯0*−xi)+=0(i.e.,xi≥u¯0*).Suppose it is optimal for the firm to produce only components1,…,jfor somej∈{1,⋯,n−1}such that their target amounts are equal and at most as high as componentj+1’s initial stock level. To find this potential optimal solution, substituteuk=Δ1−xk,k=2,…,jandul=0,l=j+1,…,ninto (12) and restrict Δ1 in zone[xj,xj+1], we have a single-dimensional objective function as(14)Πj(u1)=E[∑i=1jci((Δ1−xi)∧Ki)+c0(miniAi∧K0)+h0(miniAi∧K0+x0−Z)++b(Z−miniAi∧K0−x0)++∑i=1jhi(Δ1∧(Ki+xi))+∑i=j+1nhixi−(∑i=1nhi)(miniAi∧K0)]where the amount of mated components isminiAi=Δ1∧(K1+x1)∧⋯∧(Kj+xj)in this case, then the corresponding sub-problem isPj:minu1Πj(u1),s.t.xj−x1≤u1≤xj+1−x1,whose optimal solution is provided in the following proposition.Proposition 5Πj(u1) is quasi-convex in u1and the optimal solutionu^1jtoPjis(15)u^1j={xj−x1,ifLj(xj−x1)≥0,u1j,ifLj(xj−x1)<0≤Lj(xj+1−x1),xj+1−x1,ifLj(xj+1−x1)<0.We can show thatΠj′(u1)=∏k=1jF¯k(Δ1−xk)F¯0(Δ1)Lj(u1)and Lj(u1) is an increasing function, hence Πj(u1) is quasi-convex and (15) is a natural result. Only the uncertain capacities of components1,…,jmay have effect on the optimal solutionu^1jsince other components will not be produced, and none of the components’ capacities has effect on the optimal solution whenj=1. However, the uncertain assembly capacity, along with the random demand, always affects the optimal solution.We now explain why the constraintsui≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,…,nare never binding unless(u¯0*−xi)+=0. Note that we have argued that when producing components 1, ⋅⋅⋅, j is optimal, there must bexj<u¯0*by Lemma 2, orxj−x1<u¯0*−x1. Moreover, from the definition ofu¯0*(i.e.,L0(u¯0*)=0), there always existsLj(u¯0*−x1)≥0, which implies thatu^1j≤u¯0*−x1, hence the optimal planned amounts of the components naturally satisfy0≤ui*≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,…,n. The intuition is that when the firm plans to assemble all the mated components in stage 2 (as Π(u) itself indicates), she will never plan more than(u¯0*−xi)+units of component i in stage 1 because otherwise she may end up with assembling more end-products than she needs.Suppose it is optimal to produce all components such that their target amounts are equal. To find this potential optimal solution, substituteul=Δ1−xl,l=2,…,ninto (12) and restrict Δ1 in zone [xn, ∞), we have a single-dimensional objective function as(17)Πn(u1)=E[∑i=1nci((Δ1−xi)∧Ki)+c0(miniAi∧K0)+h0(miniAi∧K0+x0−Z)++b(Z−miniAi∧K0−x0)++∑i=1nhi(Δ1∧(Ki+xi)−miniAi∧K0)]where the amount of mated components isminiAi=Δ1∧(K1+x1)∧⋯∧(Kn+xn)in this case, then the corresponding sub-problem isPn:minu1Πn(u1),s.t.xn−x1≤u1,whose optimal solution is provided in the following proposition.Proposition 6Πn(u1) is quasi-convex in u1and the optimal solutionu^1ntoPnis(18)u^1n={u1n,ifLn(xn−x1)≤0,xn−x1,ifLn(xn−x1)>0.We can show thatΠn′(u1)=∏k=1nF¯k(Δ1−xk)F¯0(Δ1)Ln(u1)andLn(u1)is an increasing function, hence Πn(u1) is quasi-convex and (18) is a natural result. As stated before, when producing all components is optimal, there must bexn<u¯0*by Lemma 2, orxn−x1<u¯0*−x1. Moreover, from the definition ofu¯0*(i.e.,L0(u¯0*)=0), there always existsLn(u¯0*−x1)≥0, which implies thatu^1n≤u¯0*−x1, hence the optimal planned amounts of the components naturally satisfy0≤ui*≤(u¯0*−xi)+,i=1,…,n.Now that we have located the potential optimal solutionsu^1i,i=1,⋯,n, we can characterize the global optimal solution in stage 1 as follows.Proposition 7The firm's optimal production planu* in stage 1is(19)u*={(0,…,0),if0≤L1(0),(u11,0,…,0),ifL1(0)<0≤L1(x2−x1),(x2−x1,0,…,0),ifL1(x2−x1)<0≤L2(x2−x1),(u12,u12+x1−x2,0,…,0),ifL2(x2−x1)<0≤L2(x3−x1),⋯,⋯(u1n−1,u1n−1+x1−x2,…,u1n−1+x1−xn−1,0),ifLn−1(xn−1−x1)<0≤Ln−1(xn−x1),(xn−x1,xn−x2,…,xn−xn−1,0),ifLn−1(xn−x1)<0≤Ln(xn−x1),(u1n,u1n+x1−x2,…,u1n+x1−xn),ifLn(xn−x1)≤0.Interestingly, (19) is general enough to incorporate two special cases of when L0(0) > 0, or when L0(0) ≤ 0 andx1>u¯0*. In either case, the optimal solution in stage 1 is to produce nothing. But both cases imply that L1(0) ≥ 0. Therefore, (19) is the general optimal solution in stage 1.Forj=1,…,n−1, it is clear thatLj(xj−x1)<Lj(xj+1−x1)from Lj( · )’s monotonicity, and we can show that there existLj(xj+1−x1)<Lj+1(xj+1−x1)based on (16), that is, the criteria in (19) are mutually exclusive. Moreover, by definition, we haveΠj(xj+1−x1)=Πj+1(xj+1−x1). So for each criterion, using (15) and (18), one can identify the optimal solution in an algorithmic manner. The structure of this optimal solution is as predicted by Lemma 3.Corollary 4A stochastic increase in the assembly capacity leads to an increase in all components’ optimal target amounts. That is,u^1j, or equivalentlyΔ^1j,j=1,…,n, become higher if K0is stochastically larger.From the definition of Lj(u1) andu1j,j=1,…,n, we know that if K0 is stochastically larger (i.e.,F¯0(u)becomes bigger for any u), Lj(u1) will become smaller for any u1, andu1jwill become bigger. These mean that the firm tends to plan more components production when the assembly capacity is stochastically larger. This is simply because that the additional uncertain assembly capacity increases the risk of having more unused components, hence the firm becomes more cautious about a stochastically-smaller capacity.In this paper, we studied the single-period optimal production planning problem in assembly systems with random demand and uncertain production and assembly capacities. The cost-minimizing firm plans components productions before the production capacities are realized, then after the outputs of components are observed, she decides the assembly amount before the demand and assembly capacity realizations.We first studied a simplified system of selling two complementary products without an assembly stage. Without loss of generosity, assume that there are more products 2 than products 1 initially. The firm's best plan can only be: (a) producing no products or producing only product1 such that its target amount is not higher than product 2’s initial stock level, or (b) producing both products such that their target amounts are equal. In case (a), the optimal solution is dictated by the demand distribution and costs but not by the uncertain capacities. While in case (b), the firm's planned amounts of components are correlated and she needs to consider the risk of mismatch of products when making plan; as a result, the uncertain capacities play important roles in shaping the firm's optimal behavior. A stochastic increase in any product's capacity leads to an increase in the optimal target amounts. The choice between (a) and (b) is determined by the initial stock levels and product 1’s uncertain capacity. A stochastic increase in product 1’s capacity leads to an increase in the likelihood of the firm deciding to produce more both products. However, a stochastic increase in product 2’s capacity does not change this likelihood.For a general assembly system with n components, if initially the firm has more end-product than a certain level dictated by the demand distribution and costs, she will neither produce any component nor assemble any end-product; if initially the firm does not have that many end-products but does have abundant mated components, she will produce nothing for the components and assemble up to that certain level; otherwise, in stage 1 she will plan less components than what are needed to assemble up to that level and will assemble as many as possible in stage 2. In the last case, the assembly system is equivalent to a system of selling complementary components, but with uncertain assembly capacity; the firm tends to plan more when the assembly capacity is unlimited than when it is uncertain, even if assembly is absolutely free.We have assumed that only executed production bears cost. However, planning per se may cost money. For example, the cost of planning to produce uiunits of component i might beci(ui∧Ki)+ci′ui, whereci′is the unit cost of planning (e.g., cost of preparing raw material and human resource). We expect that such change of cost structure may complicate our model to a certain extent, but the corresponding model may still be tractable since Πi(u1) will remain quasi-convex. The model will be even more complicated if the cost structure is further generalized to incorporate setup costs.For future research, one may consider to extend the model into a multi-period setting. However, the problem seems extremely difficult because the production decision of each component will be affected by not only its uncertain capacity but also other components’ uncertain capacities, let alone the random demand and uncertain assembly capacity. The work of DeCroix (2013) on inventory control of an assembly system subject to supply disruptions (disruption in their paper can be thought of a special case of uncertain capacity which is either zero or infinite) demonstrates such complexities. Production and pricing in decentralized systems where the suppliers’ capacities are uncertain is also worth studying.
