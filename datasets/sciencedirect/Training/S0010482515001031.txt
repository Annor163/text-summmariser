@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tympanostomy tube placement is the most common outpatient surgical procedure in the United States. Each year more than 650,000 children younger than 15 years of age receive tympanostomy tubes [1]. Tympanostomy tubes are commonly inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid affecting hearing, frequent ear infections or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy [2]. All of these conditions are composed of the term otitis media, which is second in frequency only to upper respiratory infection as the most common illness diagnosed in children by pediatric health providers. Most children will experience at least one episode of acute otitis media by the age of 3years and by the age of 6years, nearly 40% have experienced three or more infections [3]. Otitis media with effusion (OME) can resolve spontaneously, however for patients in which, there is persistent middle ear fluid for at least 3months with the decrease in hearing, further treatment in the form of tympanostomy tubes insertion may be recommended [2]. Fig. 1illustrates the placement of the tympanostomy tube on the ear drum.11The left graph of Fig. 1 is downloaded from www.kidshealth.org.nz.Since first described in 1954 by Armstrong, tympanostomy tube placement has become the surgical treatment of choice for otitis media [4]. Placement of tympanostomy tubes improves hearing significantly in the presence of otitis media with effusion, reduces the incidence of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and provides a mechanism for drainage and administration of topical antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media. The latter has gained significant importance since it allows localized treatment for ear infections rather than systemic antibiotics use. The insertion of tympanostomy tubes involves aspiration of the middle ear fluid leading to instant improvement of hearing thresholds. The tympanostomy tubes are designed to extrude naturally from the tympanic membrane normally within 6months to 1year following the procedure.Following tympanostomy tube placement, regular scheduled follow-ups are recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology every 6months to check the status of the ear tubes [5]. This follow up care is currently performed by an ear, nose and throat specialist resulting in increased cost compared to the cost of a visit to a general practitioner [6]. The overall complexity of the procedure is low because it mostly identifies the presence and patency of the tympanostomy tube. If this procedure can be performed by an automated computer program, it can significantly reduce cost as well as enhance the clinical efficiency of both ear nose and throat specialists and general practitioners.Computer vision techniques have been widely used to automatically detect an object in natural images such as human faces [7–10], cars [11–13] and pedestrians [14–16]. The related techniques are also used to analyze medical images which have largely shown to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment decisions [17–23]. In this study we have developed a computer vision system to predict on an image if a tympanostomy tube is in place and collect feedback to adaptively improve the system classification performance. In this system, we extract a set of image features including RGB intensity features, edge-map based features and other advanced features such as Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [24], and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features [25]. We use them to learn a discriminative model to determine if an otoscopic image presents a tympanostomy tube. A cascaded classifier is constructed by the support vector machine (SVM) [26] algorithm from labeled image patches. The prediction of this classifier, when applied to a test image, is visualized. A refinement process is designed to refine this trained classifier at the point of patient care according to user feedbacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have proposed and developed a computer vision system for automatically detecting a tympanostomy tube in an otoscopic image of the ear drum. The proposed system comprises an offline classifier training process and a real-time system refinement process. The offline learning process creates a cascaded classifier with 3 layers that is designed according to our domain knowledge and observation on the various characteristics of tympanostomy tubes. A state-of-the-art supervised learning method, support vector machine, has been used to train the cascaded classifier that is then stored in a knowledge database of the system. The refinement process allows users to interact with the system aimed at system adaptation over time to a user׳s specific setting. It seeks user feedback on the prediction result of a test image during the point of check-up. Based on the user feedback, the system can automatically augment the training set by including the features extracted from the test image to refine the classifiers stored in the knowledge database. We propose the method to extract the RGB intensity features and the combination with edge-map based features to improve the quality of image representation. Other advanced but commonly used features are also examined in our system. Our empirical results show that the offline learning system can achieve a detection accuracy reaching 90% and the real-time refinement process can improve the performance of the classifier by another 3–5%.None declared.
