@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present a novel approach to treating lung sounds contaminated by heart sounds by means of quasi-periodic signal modeling. Heart sounds are described through the long and short-term quasi-periodicity generated by cardiac cycle repetition and oscillations caused by valves openings and closures, respectively. In terms of signals, these quasi-periodicities drive time-variant HS envelope and phase which are modeled by single and piecewise time polynomials, respectively. Single polynomials account for slow and continuous envelope time variations, while piecewise polynomials capture fast and abrupt phase changes in short time intervals. Such a compact signal description provides an efficient way to fundamental heart sound (FHS) components localization and posterior removal from lung sounds. The results show that the proposed method outperforms two reference methods for medium (15ml/s/kg) and high (22.5ml/s/kg) air flow rates.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Lung sound (LS) analysis is a key issue for accurate medical diagnosis as it provides valuable information about lungs psychologies and pathologies. The major general problem, however, remains the presence of heart sounds (HS) which interferes with LS in 20–150Hz approximately [1–3]. Incorrectly localized and removed fundamental heart sound components (FHS) can usually render LS unfit for diagnosis purposes.Denoising of LS is often viewed as a two-step process, namely, (1) HS localization and (2) suppression. In the literature we find a number of approaches to HS localization based on time–frequency filtering [4], higher-order statistics [5], wavelet decomposition [6,7], sound entropy [8] and singular spectrum analysis [9]. Additional efforts have been made to suppress FHS components from LS with the aim of preserving most of the LS signal content in the HS frequency range. Approaches like independent component analysis [10], adaptive filtering [11–13], linear and non-linear prediction [14,15] and blind source separation [16] were dealt with. A thorough analysis would be needed to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned methods and bring out their virtues and shortcomings. However, a general remark regarding limitations usually stems from either an a priori assumption on HS stationarity or a lack of robustness in conditions of middle and high air flow rates.Herein we present a novel approach to HS characterization by explicit modeling of the long and short-term quasi-periodicities, which arise from cardiac cycle repetition and vibrations caused by openings and closures of the valves, respectively. In the signal space the former account for the instantaneous envelope while the latter address the issue of the time-variant phase. Under the assumption of slow and continuous periodicity variation, the envelope is modeled by a harmonic structure whose coefficients are low degree single time polynomials. Phase changes, on the contrary, are fast and abrupt and occur in short time intervals corresponding to FHS components; accordingly, the phase is modeled as a single sinusoid scaled by uniformly distributed piecewise polynomials. Such a modeling allows for a robust HS characterization in middle and high air flow rates scenarios. Moreover, the method is computationally highly efficient because the model parameters are estimated from an overdetermined linear system of equations. Note that single and piecewise polynomials have already been utilized in biomedical signal processing e.g. [17,18] but to the best of our knowledge never for the present application.The present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is dedicated to HS modeling in terms of time-variant envelope and phase; in Section 3 we present experimental results in the context of a twofold comparative study; finally, the conclusions appear in Section 4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have presented a novel approach to HS localization and suppression in LS by means of quasi-periodic modeling. We have shown that inherent quasi-periodicities in HS (envelope and phase) can be compactly modeled by a joint action of single and piecewise polynomials. Such a modeling scheme allows for a correct HS characterization even in conditions of large LS. The model parameters are estimated in an efficient fashion from an overdetermined linear system of equations.The HS model has proven to be capable of fitting well to data. Considering LS localization we have shown that the proposed modeling method outperforms a singular spectrum analysis method in terms of fundamental HS component position, duration and signal-to-distortion ratio. The differences become even more prominent for high flow rates, indicating a very good robustness against LS for the proposed method. As for HS suppression in LS, the proposed method has proven to be better than an approach based on multiscale product and linear prediction. It was shown that in terms of average PSD difference between clean and denoised LS for both medium and high flow rates, the proposed method is situated 2–5dB below the other method. In view of these results, we think that the proposed method is a good candidate for clinical applications which include LS sound analysis.None declared.None declared.
