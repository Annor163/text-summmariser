@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper the fault detection problem is solved using an alternative methodology based on a fuzzy/Bayesian strategy combining a Bayesian network and the fuzzy set theory. The new important issue in this proposed methodology is to address uncertainties in the input of the Bayesian Network. This contribution is possible since the fuzzy set theory is used as the knowledge representation. To illustrate the technique, the fault detection problem in induction machine stator-winding is considered. Specifically, the faults in the induction machine stator-winding are detected by a state change of stator current. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the advance of the proposed methodology when compared to standard Bayesian network.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fault detection and analysis is a very important strategy that is commonly employed in the industry with the purpose of allowing a cost–effective maintenance policy, keeping productivity standards and ensuring safety. The fault analysis gives support for the design of corrective actions, system redundancies, and safety policies in order to mitigate the effects of a fault [1]. A fault diagnosis procedure is typically divided into three tasks: (i) the fault detection, indicating the occurrence of some fault in a monitored system; (ii) the fault isolation, establishing the type and/or location of the fault; and (iii) the fault identification, determining the magnitude of the fault. After a fault has been detected and diagnosed, in some applications it is required that the fault be self-corrected, usually through controller reconfiguration. This is usually referred to as fault accommodation.The literature presents several classes of strategies to deal with fault detection and isolation (FDI) [2]. These strategies can be, in general, divided in quantitative approach. These strategies are, in general, divided into two kind of approaches: (i) quantitative [3] and qualitative [4,5].Most of the quantitative approaches are based on the knowledge of mathematical models of the plant. Many survey papers with different emphasis on various quantitative approaches have been published over the past years. The main approaches in this context are based on (unknown input) observers [2,6–10], parity relations [2,11] and Kalman or robust filters [2,12–15]. The requirement of a mathematical model of the plant can lead to several difficulties in the implementation of these approaches, for instance due to factors such as system complexity, high dimensionality, nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties. Further, in the case the neural network plays a role as an observer, it falls into the class of quantitative approaches [16,17].On the other hand, most of the qualitative approaches are based on some pattern analysis of the historic process data. The main related approaches are: signed directed graph [18–20], fault tree [21], fuzzy system [22–24], qualitative trend analysis [25–28], mutual information [29], neural networks [30,31] (in the case of classification), artificial immune systems [32–34], Bayesian networks [35–39] and the combination of techniques [40].In this paper, a new qualitative approach for fault detection is presented. This new approach is based on a Fuzzy/Bayesian representation. Unlike the traditional Bayesian networks as reported in [37–39], the Fuzzy/Bayesian proposed in this paper combine the potential for aggregation of information/knowledge of the fuzzy sets theory for processing input uncertainties in the Bayesian network – for simplicity we will call this combination of fuzzy/Bayesian network. The approach proposed in this paper was motivated by the approaches presented in [41,42]. Although references [41,42] deal with the problem proposed in this paper, the approach proposed in [42] solve the problem of only one unknown evidence, and [41] needs several traditional Bayesian network information, beyond the necessity of conditional independence of evidence. In the next section this topic is considered deeply. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, the problem of fault detection in the stator winding of induction machine is presented.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows a new Fuzzy/Bayesian Network approach. Section 3 presents and analyzes the induction machine simulation considering the case of fault on stator-winding and shows the results for fault detection in induction machine stator-winding. Finally, Section 4 presents the concluding remarks.Bayesian theorem is an effective tool for reasoning under the condition of uncertainty. Propositions are given numerical parameters representing their degree of beliefs under some body of knowledge, these parameters are then combined and manipulated based on the rules of probability theory. P(Hi∣ϵj) represents the subjective belief in the hypothesis, Hi, given the knowledge of the evidence, ϵj. However, if there is uncertainty in the evidence, the application of the traditional Bayes rule implies to fix the knowledge of the evidence to belong a given set. Clearly this a drawback of this kind of approach. In order to solve this problem, a new Fuzzy/Bayesian inference is proposed in this paper. Other papers deal with the problem proposed, as in [41,42]. It is observed that the approach proposed in [42] solve the problem of only one unknown evidence and [41] needs several traditional Bayesian network information, beyond the necessity of conditional independence of evidence ϵj. The proposed approach is more simple and differs from [41] because the inference in Fuzzy/Bayesian network needs only the conditional probability table P(Hi∣ϵ1, ϵ2, …, ϵk) and it is given by:(1)P(Hi∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,…,ϵ˜k)=∑j=12kP(Hi∣ϵj1,ϵj2,…,ϵjk)*∏m=1kμϵ˜jm∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jmwhere: Hiis the hypothesis to be tested,ϵ˜kis the fuzzy evidences. For each evidenceϵ˜ka pair of membership functions (μϵ˜) is defined that describes the uncertainty inherent in the evidence description.The next Theorem plays a crucial rule since it shows that the summation of the hypothesis given fuzzy evidences is also unitary. This result allows to make the proposed approach consistent.Theorem 2.1The summation of the hypothesis probabilities related to a set of fuzzy evidences is(2)∑i=1nP(Hi∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,…,ϵ˜k)=1where n is the number of hypothesis.To show that (2) is true take the summation in (1), namely:(3)∑i=1n∑j=12kP(Hi∣ϵj1,ϵj2,…,ϵjk)*∏m=1kμϵ˜jm∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jmDefine P(Hij)≜P(Hi∣ϵj1, ϵj2, …, ϵjk) andMj≜∏m=1kμϵ˜jm∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jmwith p≜2kin (3).Thus (3) may be rewritten as:∑i=1n∑j=1pP(Hij)Mj=P(H11)M1+P(H12)M2+P(H13)M3+⋯+P(H1p)Mp+P(H21)M1+P(H22)M2+P(H33)M3+⋯+P(H2p)Mp⋮+P(Hn1)M1+P(Hn2)M2+P(Hn3)M3+⋯+P(Hnp)Mpwhich is equivalent to:∑i=1n∑j=1pP(Hij)Mj=P(H11)M1+P(H21)M1+P(H31)M1+⋯+P(Hn1)M1+P(H12)M2+P(H22)M2+P(H32)M2+⋯+P(Hn2)M2⋮+P(H1p)Mp+P(H2p)Mp+P(H3p)Mp+⋯+P(Hnp)MpRewriting the previous equation as:∑i=1n∑j=1pP(Hij)Mj=P(H11)+P(H21)+P(H31)+⋯+P(Hn1)M1+P(H12)+P(H22)+P(H32)+⋯+P(Hn2)M2⋮+P(H1p)+P(H2p)+P(H3p)+⋯+P(Hnp)MpNotice that by definition∑i=1nP(Hi∣ϵ1i,ϵ2i,…,ϵki)=1, thus:∑j=1pMj=1and from the definition of Mj, it follows that:∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jm∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jm=1or∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jm1∑j=12k∏m=1kμϵ˜jm=1This shows that (2) is unitary as proposed.   □Many studies have shown that a large proportion of induction machine faults are related to the stator-winding [43–46]. The induction machine stator-winding is subject to stress due to many factors, which include thermal overload, mechanical vibration and peak voltage caused by a speed controller. The deterioration of insulation usually begins as a short circuit fault of the stator-winding. This section describes the model that is employed here for the simulation of inter-turn short circuits in the stator windings of induction machines.This work employs a generic model for the machine [47], valid for any dq (direct and quadrature) axis speed obtained by the Park's transformation [48]. Representing the currents, voltages and electromagnetic flows by i,vand λ, the resistance, leakage and mutual inductance by r, Lland Lm, the phases a, b and c by indexes a, b and c, the windings of the stator and rotor by indexes s and r, the stator and rotor voltages equations become:(4)[vs]=[rs][is]+d[λs]dt(5)[vr]=[rr][ir]+d[λr]dtwhere[vs]=[vas1vas2vbsvcs]T[vr]=[varvbrvcr]T[is]=[iasias−ifibsics]T[ir]=[iaribricr]T[λs]=[λas1λas2λbsλcs]T[λr]=[λarλbrλcr]TIn the above, the index as2 represents the shorted turns and ifis the current in the shorted turns. Fig. 1represents the schematic diagram of a motor with an inter-turn short circuit.In the model proposed in ref. [47], the stator windings voltages are given by:(6)Vds+23μrsifcosθ=rsids+dλdsdt+ωλqs(7)Vqs+23μrsifsinθ=rsiqs+dλqsdt+ωλds(8)V0s+13μrsif=rsi0s+dλ0sdtThe rotor circuit equations are the same as for traditional symmetrical model.The stator and the rotor electromagnetic flows of stator in dq axis, are given by:(9)λds=Lsids+Lmidr−23μLsifcosθ(10)λqs=Lsiqs+Lmiqr−23μLsifsinθ(11)λ0s=Llsi0s+μ3Llsifsinθ(12)λdr=Lridr+Lmids−23μLmifcosθ(13)λqr=Lriqr+Lmiqs−23μLmifsinθThe voltage and the induced electromagnetic flow in the short-circuit turns are given by:(14)vas2=μrs(idscosθ+iqssinθ−if)+dλas2dt(15)λas2=μLls(iqssinθ+idscosθ−if)+μLm(iqssinθ++idscosθ+iqrsinθ+idrcosθ−23μif)The electromagnetic torque is given by:(16)T=32p2Lm(iqsidr−idsiqr)−p2μLmifiqrThe induction machine stator current simulation results for a fault in which 5% of turns in the phase a become in short circuit after the time 0.72s are shown in Figs. 2–4. The root mean square (rms) current values are illustrated in Figs. 5–7. Notice that when a short circuit occurs in phase a, the increase in the current of phase a is greater than that of phases b and c. The fault detection methodology proposed here is based on finding such events of non-ballanced changes in the current rms values.This section describes the implementation details and presents the simulation results in the turn-to-turn short circuit detection in the stator winding of induction motors. A block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 8. The system monitors the instantaneous values of stator currents ias, ibs, ics. First, the analog measurements are converted to digital data by an A/D converter and then the value (rms) of each phase current is computed.Considering thati¯denotes the rms value associated with the instantaneous current i. In the case of the induction machine with star connection (as done in the simulations), notice that when occurs a short circuit in the phase a, the increase of the phase current in a is greater than the current of the phases b and c, when occurs a short-circuit in phase b, the increase of the phase current in b is greater than the current of phases a and c, when a short circuit occurs in phase c, the increase of the current phase c is greater than the current phases a and b. So the following rules can be stated:IF∣i¯as−i¯bs∣≅∣i¯cs−i¯as∣>∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣THEN fault in phase a;IF∣i¯as−i¯bs∣≅∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣>∣i¯cs−i¯as∣THEN fault in phase b;IF∣i¯cs−i¯as∣≅∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣>∣i¯as−i¯bs∣THEN fault in phase c;IF∣i¯as−i¯bs∣≅∣i¯cs−i¯as∣≅∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣THEN there is no fault.Considering only the information associated to the rules above it would be simple to implement a system fault detection based on a cause/effect (neural network, expert system and even a conventional Bayesian network) to solve this problem without needing to implement the methodology proposed in this paper to the problem. However, the occurrence of an unbalance of the motor supply voltage would cause the system to acknowledge a false fault detection if one considers the cited methods. In fact, the new important issue in the proposed approach is this robust characteristic to faults which cause disturbances of very low level.For the methodology implementation is considered the following evidences (ϵj) and hypotheses (Hi):•ϵ1=True,if∣i¯as−i¯bs∣>0.5False,if∣i¯as−i¯bs∣<=0.5ϵ2=True,if∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣>0.5False,if∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣<=0.5ϵ3=True,if∣i¯cs−i¯as∣>0.5False,if∣i¯cs−i¯as∣<=0.5H1 – hypothesis of non-occurrence of fault;H2 – hypothesis of fault in phase a;H3 – hypothesis of fault in phase b;H4 – hypothesis of fault in phase c;For training the traditional Bayesian network is used a set of 1100 samples (including noisy data) obtained from the induction machine simulation operating in normal operation, 2% – 30% of short circuited coils on phase a, b and c, alternately [49]. For the case of 2% of the coils in short circuit, the difference in magnitude between the currents is about 0.5A. For values lesser than 0.5A, the membership functions presented in Fig. 9have been used – in this case it has been applied the methodology based on the fuzzy/Bayesian network described in Section 2. The results obtained with the traditional Bayesian network ϵj=True(T) and ϵj=False(F), are presented in Table 1.To illustrate the proposed methodology, the following example is considered:∣i¯as−i¯bs∣=0,∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣=0.51and∣i¯cs−i¯as∣=0.4resulting in evidences ϵ1=F, ϵ2=T e ϵ3=F. For these evidences if one considers the results from Table 1 it follows that the conditional probabilities would be: P(H2∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.0979, P(H3∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.3814 and P(H4∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.4794.However using the proposed methodology described in Section 2, with∣i¯cs−i¯as∣=0.4causes evidence ϵ3 with pertinence equal to 0.8, for the set ϵ3=T, and pertinence equal to 0.2 for set ϵ3=F (considering the membership functions given in Fig. 9 and the inference in (1) applied in Table 1 which results in data presented in Table 2). Thus the following conditional probabilitiesP(H1∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.0562,P(H2∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.0676,P(H3∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.2203andP(H4∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.6559are obtained. Therefore the proposed approach indicates, with greater likelihood, that there is an occurrence of short circuit in phase c, unlike a traditional Bayesian network. Notice that the fuzzy step plays a crucial role in the context of making a better decision in the transition region of a evidence to be true or false.As a second example, consider a voltage unbalance between the phases that feed the induction machine, namely:∣i¯as−i¯bs∣=0.82,∣i¯bs−i¯cs∣=1.11and∣i¯cs−i¯as∣=0.29. This three-phase voltage unbalance results in evidences ϵ1=T, ϵ2=T e ϵ3=F. For these evidences, if one considers the results from Table 1, a traditional Bayesian network, it follows that the conditional probabilities would be: P(H1∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.0192, P(H2∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.1218, P(H3∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.7500 and P(H4∣ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵ3)=0.1090, indicating, with greater likelihood, that there is an occurrence of short circuit in phase b. However, using the proposed methodology described in Section 2, for∣i¯cs−i¯as∣=0.29, it causes evidence ϵ3 with pertinence equal to 0.58, for the set ϵ3=T, and pertinence equal to 0.42 for set ϵ3=F (considering the membership functions given in Fig. 9 and the inference in (1) applied in Table 1 which results in data presented in Table 3). Thus the following conditional probabilitiesP(H1∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.4606,P(H2∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.1127,P(H3∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.3479andP(H4∣ϵ˜1,ϵ˜2,ϵ˜3)=0.0787are obtained. Therefore, the proposed approach indicates that there is not an occurrence of short circuit in phase b, unlike a traditional Bayesian network.
