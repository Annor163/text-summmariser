@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we consider a multi-period fuzzy portfolio optimization problem with minimum transaction lots. Based on possibility theory, we formulate a mean-semivariance portfolio selection model with the objectives of maximizing the terminal wealth and minimizing the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon. In the proposed model, we take the return, risk, transaction costs, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots into consideration. To reflect investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives, a fuzzy decision technique is employed to transform the proposed model into a single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we design a genetic algorithm for solution. Finally, we give an empirical application in Chinese stock markets to demonstrate the idea of our model and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Markowitz (1952) originally proposed mean-variance model for portfolio selection, which laid the foundation of modern portfolio analysis. Portfolio optimization deals with the problem of how to allocate investor’s wealth among a basket of securities. To realize this idea, the proper portfolio model must be presented. Most of existing portfolio selection models have been proposed on the assumption of a perfect fractionability of the investments, which are difficult to implement. In real world, each security has its minimum transaction lot. So it is necessary to consider rounds. To reflect this realistic characteristic of security, some researchers have proposed a series of mixed-integer programming models. Speranza (1996) proposed a mixed-integer programming model on the basis of the mean absolute deviation model in Konno and Yamazaki (1991) by taking minimum transaction lots and maximum number of securities into consideration, and designed a simple two-phase heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed model. Mansini and Speranza (1999) considered a NP-complete portfolio selection problem with minimum lots and presented three heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. In Kellerer, Mansini, and Speranza (2000), a portfolio selection model with fixed costs and minimum transaction lots was proposed and two linear programming based heuristic algorithms were designed for solution. Konno and Wijayanayake (2001) discussed portfolio optimization problem with concave transaction costs and minimum transaction lots under the framework of mean-absolute deviation risk measure, and devised a branch and bound algorithm for solving the proposed model. Konno and Wijayanayake (2002) discussed the market illiquidity effects and investigated a portfolio optimization problem with D. C. transaction costs and minimal transaction unit constraints. Recently, Lin and Liu (2008) proposed three possible models for portfolio selection problems with minimum transaction lots, and devised genetic algorithms to solve them. Baixauli-Soler, Alfaro-Cid, and Fernandez-Blanco (2011) employed VaR as risk measure to investigate an asset allocation problem under real constraints, such as minimum transaction lots and non-linear cost structure.Notice that all the models mentioned above are single period portfolio selection models. However, in real world, investors tend to invest long-term investment. The investors should adjust their wealth from time to time. So it is nature to investigate multi-period portfolio selection problems. Numerous researchers have studied multi-period portfolio optimization problems, see for instance, Elton and Gruber (1974),Fama (1970) and Hakansson (1971). Li and Ng (2000) made breakthrough result for dynamic portfolio. In their model, they employed the idea of embedding the problem in a tractable auxiliary problem to investigate the mean-variance formulation in multi-period portfolio selection and obtained the corresponding mean-variance efficient frontier. After that, Zhu, Li, and Wang (2004) used the same approach to study the continuous-time dynamic multi-period problem by taking risk control into account. Rocha and Kuhn (2012) formulated a dynamic mean-variance model for electricity portfolio management. Gülpınar and Rustem (2007) presented min–max formulations of multi-period mean-variance optimization problem with multiple rival risk and return scenarios. Fonseca and Rustem (2012) applied linear decision rules to a robust multiperiod international portfolio. Costa and Araujo (2008) considered a multi-period generalized mean-variance model with Markov switching in the key market parameters. Calafiore (2008) concerned with multi-period sequential decision problems for financial asset allocation and presented a multi-period portfolio optimization model with control policies. Briec and Kerstens (2009) proposed a general approach for multi-horizon mean-variance portfolio analysis. Fu, Lari-Lavassani, and Li (2010) considered continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection with borrowing constraint, i.e., under different interest rates for borrowing and lending, rendering the market incomplete. Fu, Wei, and Yang (2014) considered the optimal asset allocation problem in a continuous-time regime-switching market. Çelikyurt and Özekici (2007) presented several multi-period portfolio optimization models where the market consists of a riskless asset and several risky assets. The literatures mentioned were proposed on the framework of probability theory.In probabilistic portfolio models, the returns of risky assets are regarded as random variables with probability distributions. The basic assumption of them is that the future situation of risky assets can be correctly reflected by its historical data. However, since financial markets are complex and ever-changing, this kind of assumption is hard to ensure in real world. As is well known, portfolio decision-making is often affected by many non-probabilistic factors including social, economic, political, people’s cognitive and psychological factors, etc. For example, REITs and the financial crisis mentioned by Basse, Friedrich, and Vazquez Bea (2009) are also affected by aforementioned human factors, which have caused some instability in markets affecting the correlations between the returns of different asset classes and that this observation is a reminder of the fact that the correlation matrices of returns on risky assets regularly used in financial optimizations are not necessarily stable over time. Thus, the influence of experts’ experiences and knowledge, and investors’ subjective opinions on portfolio selection cannot be neglected (such as Tanaka and Guo, 1999, Fang, Lai, and Wang, 2006, Vercher, Bermúdez, and Segura, 2007, Liu, Zhang, and Xu, 2012 and so on). Due to the influence of above-mentioned non-probabilistic factors, the future situation of risky assets is usually characterized by fuzzy uncertainty such as vagueness and ambiguity. Namely, decision makers are usually provided with information which is characterized by vague linguistic descriptions such as high risk, low profit, high interest rate, etc. Notice that all these factors mentioned above are affected by human’s subjective opinions. They have a great influence on financial markets such that the returns of risky assets are characterized by vague linguistic values or fuzzy values in many cases. Taking human’s subjective factors into consideration, fuzzy approaches are more suitable than probabilistic approaches in characterizing the uncertainty in real financial markets as pointed by Liu and Zhang (2013). With the wide use of fuzzy set theory in Zadeh (1965), more and more researchers have realized that they could use the fuzzy set theory to handle the vagueness and ambiguity, see for example, Tanaka and Guo (1999),Carlsson, Fullér, and Majlender (2002),Fang et al. (2006),Vercher et al. (2007),Zhang, Wang, Chen, and Nie (2007),Zhang, Zhang, and Xiao (2009), Zhang et al. (2010), Barak, Abessi, and Modarres (2013), and Liu and Zhang (2013). Though great progress has been made in fuzzy portfolio selection, most of existing models are single period models. Recently, Sadjadi, Seyedhosseini, and Hassanlou (2011) discussed a fuzzy multi-period portfolio optimization problem with different rates for borrowing and lending. Zhang, Liu, and Xu (2012) proposed a possibilistic mean-semivariance-entropy model for multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection. Liu et al. (2012) presented four multi-period fuzzy portfolio optimization models by using multiple criteria. To our knowledge, the researches about multi-period fuzzy portfolio selection problem with real constrains are few. The purpose of this paper is to investigate multi-period portfolio selection problem in fuzzy environment with minimum transaction lots. We present a mean-semivariance model by using possibility theory. In the proposed model, we consider six criteria, including the return, risk, transaction cost, diversification degree, cardinality constraint and minimum transaction lots. The investment return is measured by possibilistic mean value of the return rate of a portfolio. The investment risk is quantified by the lower possibilistic semivariance of the return rate of portfolio and the diversification degree is measured by the proportion entropy in Kapur (1990). Since the proposed model is a bi-objective programming problem, an S-shape membership function is used to express investor’s satisfaction degree for each objective and then transform it into a corresponding single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. After that, we design a novel genetic algorithm for solution.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some basic conceptions about fuzzy variables. In Section 3, we first formulate a bi-objective multi-period portfolio optimization model with minimum lots, in which we assume that the investor wants to maximize the terminal wealth and minimize the cumulative risk over all investment horizon. Then, we employ a nonlinear S-shape fuzzy membership functions to express investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives. By using the nonlinear S-shape membership functions, we transform the proposed model into a single programming problem. In Section 4, we design a genetic algorithm to solve the proposed model. In Section 5, we use an empirical application in Chinese stock markets to demonstrate the idea of our model and the effectiveness of the designed algorithm for solution. In Section 6, we conclude this paper by some remarks.In this section, let us first review some basic conceptions about fuzzy variables, which we need in the following sections.Let A be a fuzzy number, i.e. such fuzzy subset A of the real lineRwith a membership functionμA:R⟶[0,1],that (see Dubois and Prade, 1980):(I)A is normal, i.e. there exists an element x0 such that μA(x0) = 1;A is fuzzy convex, i.e.μA(λx1+(1−λ)x2)≥μA(x1)∧μA(x2),(∀x1,x2∈R;λ∈[0,1]);μAis upper semicontinuous;supp(A) is bounded, wheresupp(A)=cl{x∈R|μA(x)>γ}and cl is the γ-level set of A as[A]γ=[a̲(γ),a¯(γ)](∀γ∈[0,1])closure operator.Denote the family of fuzzy numbers asF. For anyA∈F,we denote the γ-level set of A as[A]γ=[a̲(γ),a¯(γ)](γ∈[0,1]). Fuzzy numbers can also be considered as possibility distributions. IfA∈Fis a fuzzy number andx∈Ra real number then μA(x) can be interpreted as the degree of possibility of the statement ‘x is A’.LetA∈Fbe a fuzzy number with[A]γ=[a̲(γ),a¯(γ)](γ∈[0,1]). Carlsson and Fullér (2001) defined the possibilistic mean value of fuzzy number A as follows(1)E(A)=∫01γ(a̲(γ)+a¯(γ))dγ.In Saeidifar and Pasha (2009), if we set the weighted function as f(γ) = 2γ, then we have the lower and upper possibilistic variances of A with the following forms(2)Var−(A)=2∫01γ(E(A)−a̲(γ))2dγ,(3)Var+(A)=2∫01γ[E(A)−a̲(γ)]2dγ.In particular, if A is a symmetrical fuzzy number, then Var−(A) = Var+(A).Let A, B be two fuzzy numbers, and letλ,μ∈Rbe two any given real numbers. Carlsson and Fullér (2001) defined the possibilistic mean value about the linear combination of A and B as follows(4)E(λA+μB)=λE(A)+μE(B).Based on Zhang et al. (2012), the following results can be obtained.For any given two fuzzy numbers A with[A]γ=[a̲(γ),a¯(γ)]and B with[B]γ=[b̲(γ),b¯(γ)],the upper and lower possibilistic semicovariances between A and B are, respectively, defined as(5)Cov+(A,B)=2∫01γ[E(A)−a¯(γ)][E(B)−b¯(γ)]dγ,(6)Cov−(A,B)=2∫01γ[E(A)−a̲(γ)][E(B)−b̲(γ)]dγ.Similar to Theorem 2 in Zhang et al. (2012), the following conclusions of the upper and lower possibilistic semivariances can be obtained.Theorem 1Let A1, A2, …, Anbe n fuzzy numbers, and let λ1, λ2, …, λnbe n nonnegative real numbers. Then, we have(7)Var−(∑i=1nλiAi)=∑i=1nλi2Var−(Ai)+2∑i<j=1nλiλjCov−(Ai,Aj),(8)Var+(∑i=1nλiAi)=∑i=1nλi2Var+(Ai)+2∑i<j=1nλiλjCov+(Ai,Aj).According to the definitions above, we can obtain the following formulas for a trapezoidal fuzzy number A = (a, b, α, β) with tolerance interval [a, b], left width α > 0 and right width β > 0 if its membership function takes the following formμA(x)={1−a−xα,ifa−α≤x≤a,1,ifx∈[a,b],1−x−bβ,ifb≤x≤b+β,0,otherwise.Then, the γ-level set of A can be denoted as [A]γ= [a − (1 − γ)α, b + (1 − γ)β] (∀γ ∈ [0, 1]). By Eq. (1), the possibilistic mean value of A can be denoted as(9)E(A)=a+b2+β−α6.Using Eqs. (2) and (3), the upper and lower possibilistic variances of A can be, respectively, represented as(10)Var+(A)=(b−a2+α+β6)2+β218,(11)Var−(A)=(b−a2+α+β6)2+α218.In this section, we discuss a multi-period portfolio selection problem in fuzzy environment with minimum lot. We assume that an investor allocates his initial wealth W1 among n securities and a risk-free asset at the beginning of period 1 and obtains his terminal wealth at the end of period T. He could readjust his wealth at the every beginning of the following T − 1 consecutive time periods. We also assume that the return rates of securities at each period are characterized by trapezoidal fuzzy variables and the return rate of the risk-free asset is a constant. For the better understanding of our paper, we first introduce all the notations that will be used in the following sections. For i = 1, 2, …, n and t = 1, 2, …, T, we letpt, ithe price of per share on security i at period t;the number of transaction lots invested in security i at period t;the invested amount on risk-free asset at period t;the minimum and maximum number of transaction lots of security i at period t;the available wealth at the beginning of period t;the investment proportion of security i at period t;the investment proportion of risk-free asset at period t;the return rate of security i at period t, where rt, i= (at, i, bt, i, αt, i, βt, i);the transaction cost of the minimal transaction unit on security i at period t;the return rate of the portfolio at period t;the return of the portfolio at period t;the preset minimum return rate of the portfolio at period t;the risk-free return rate at period t;the preset maximum risk tolerance level of the portfolio at period t;the preset minimum diversification degree of the portfolio at period t.Most of existing portfolio selection models have been proposed on the assumption that the investments are perfect fractionability, in such a way that the investment proportion of portfolio for each security could be represented by real numbers. However, in real financial market, the transaction of securities is usually associated with minimum lots or rounds. For different kinds of securities, the minimum lots may be different, for instance 100, 500 or 1000 shares. Let us take A-share in Chinese security markets for example. Its minimal unit is 100 shares. The worth for each transaction lot is equal to pt, i= Niyt, i, where yt, iis the market price of security i at period t and Niis the number of minimum units of security i required as minimum quantity. xt, ipt, idenotes as the part of the total available wealth that the investor decides to invest on security i at period t.In this section, we employ the crisp possibilistic mean value of the net return on the portfolio at each period to measure the return of portfolio. The risk on the return rate of portfolio at each period is quantified by the lower possibilistic variance and the diversification degree is measured by the proportion entropy in Kapur (1990).For the transaction costs, we assume in the sequel that the transaction costs at period t is a V shape function of the difference between the tth period portfolio xt= (xt, 1, xt, 2, …, xt, n, xt, n + 1) and the t − 1th period portfolio xt − 1 = (xt − 1, 1, xt − 1, 2, …, xt − 1, n, xt − 1, n + 1). Thus, the transaction costs of security i at period t can be expressed by(12)Ct,i=ct,i|xt,i−xt−1,i|pt,i.Similar to Yoshimoto (1996), the absolute term on the right hand side of Eq. (12) can be rewritten in the following form(13)Ct,i=ct,i(dt,i++dt,i−),wheredt,i+=12{|xt,i−xt−1,i|pt,i+(xt,i−xt−1,i)pt,i}anddt,i−=12{|xt,i−xt−1,i|pt,i−(xt,i−xt−1,i)pt,i};dt,i+anddt,i−satisfy the following relationships(xt,i−xt−1,i)pt,i=dt,i+−dt,i−,dt,i+·dt,i−=0,dt,i+,dt,i−≥0,i=1,2,…,n,t=1,2,…,T.Notice thatdt,i−anddt,i+cannot be zero at the same time. Hence, we can find out that if the differencedt,i+−dt,i−is positive (negative),dt,i+(dt,i−)becomes the difference.Since the transaction costs are not needed for the risk-free asset, by Eq. (13), the total transaction costs of the portfolio at period t can be represented by(14)Ct=∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−).The return on the portfolio xt= (xt, 1, xt, 2, …, xt, n, xt, n + 1) at period t can be expressed by(15)RP,t=∑i=1nxt,ipt,irt,i+rf(t)xt,n+1,t=1,2,…,T,wherext,n+1=Wt−∑i=1nxt,ipt,i−Ct.Thus, the available wealth at the beginning of period t + 1 can be expressed by(16)Wt+1=∑i=1nxt,ipt,i(1+rt,i)+(Wt−∑i=1nxt,ipt,i−Ct)(1+rf(t)).Solving Eq. (16) recursively, the terminal wealth obtained at the end of period T can be represented by(17)WT+1=W1∏t=1T(1+rf(t))+∑t=1T∑i=1nxt,ipt,i(rt,i−rf(t))∏i=t+1T(1+rf(i))−∑t=1TCt∏t=1T(1+rf(t)).As rt, iis a fuzzy variable, the terminal wealth WT + 1 is also a fuzzy variable. By Eq. (1), the possibilistic mean value of WT + 1 can be expressed by(18)E(WT+1)=W1∏t=1T(1+rf(t))+∑t=1T∑i=1nxt,ipt,i(E(rt,i)−rf(t))×∏i=t+1T(1+rf(i))−∑t=1T∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−)∏t=1T(1+rf(t)).From the assumption above, the return rate of security i at period t, rt, i= (at, i, bt, i, αt, i, βt, i), is trapezoidal fuzzy variable for all i = 1, 2, …, n and t = 1, 2, …, T. By the sup-min extension principle in Zadeh (1965), we can conclude that the return of the portfolio at period t (i.e., RP, t), the return rate of portfolio at the tth period rp, tand the terminal wealth WT + 1 are all trapezoidal fuzzy variables. By Eqs. (9) and (18), we have(19)E(WT+1)=∑t=1T∑i=1nxt,ipt,i(at,i+bt,i2+βt,i−αt,i6−rf(t))×∏i=t+1T(1+rf(i))+W1∏t=1T(1+rf(t))−∑t=1T∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−)∏t=1T(1+rf(t)).Let wt= (wt, 1, wt, 2, …, wt, n, wt, n + 1) be the investment proportion of the portfolio at period t. By Eq. (9), the return rate of the portfolio at period t can be expressed by(20)E(rp,t)=∑i=1nwt,i(at,i+bt,i2+βt,i−αt,i6)+wt,n+1rf(t),where∑i=1n+1wt,i=1andwt,i=xt,ipt,iWt−∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−)(i=1,2,…,n).From Eq. (11), the lower possibilistic semivariance of the return rate on the portfolio at period t can be calculated by(21)Var−(rp,t)=[∑i=1nwt,i(bt,i−at,i2+βt,i+αt,i6)]2+118(∑i=1nwt,iαt,i)2.Thus, the cumulative lower possibilistic semivariance over the whole holding period can be computed by(22)V(x)=∑t=1T{[∑i=1nwt,i(bt,i−at,i2+βt,i+αt,i6)]2+118(∑i=1nwt,iαt,i)2}.Based on the analysis above, we quantify the return of security by the possibilistic mean value and the risk by the lower possibilistic variance. We assume that the investor wants to maximize the terminal wealth and minimize the cumulative risk on the return rates of portfolios over T investment periods. At the same time, he requires the return rate and the diversification degree of portfolio at each period must achieve or exceed their corresponding preset minimum levels and the risk of the return rate on portfolio must be smaller than the given maximum risk tolerance level at each period. Moreover, he restricts to hold at most K assets in portfolio at each period. Then, the multi-period portfolio selection problem can be constructed as the following bi-objective programming problem (P1):(23)(P1){maxE(WT+1)=∑t=1T∑i=1nxt,ipt,i(at,i+bt,i2+βt,i−αt,i6−rf(t))×∏i=t+1T(1+rf(i))+W1∏t=1T(1+rf(t))−∑t=1T∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−)∏t=1T(1+rf(t))minV(x)=∑t=1T{[∑i=1nwt,i(bt,i−at,i2+βt,i+αt,i6)]2+118(∑i=1nwt,iαt,i)2}s.t.∑i=1nxt,ipt,i+∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−)≤E(Wt),(23)∑i=1nwt,i(at,i+bt,i2+βt,i−αt,i6)+wt,n+1rf(t)≥r(t),(24)[∑i=1nwt,i(bt,i−at,i2+βt,i+αt,i6)]2+118(∑i=1nwt,iαt,i)2≤δt,(25)−∑i=1n+1wt,iln(wt,i)≥et,(26)∑i=1n+1wt,i=1(wt,i=xt,ipt,iWt−∑i=1nct,i(dt,i++dt,i−),i=1,2,…,n),(27)∑i=1n+1sign(wt,i)≤K,(28)0≤lt,i≤xt,i≤ut,i,xt,i∈Z;(29)dt,i+−dt,i−=(xt,i−xt−1,i)pt,i,dt,i+,dt,i−≥0,dt,i+·dt,i−=0,i=1,2,…,n,t=1,2,…,T,where Eq. (23) indicates that the sum of both the total invested amount at the beginning of period t and the corresponding capital consumed in transaction costs at period t must be no more than the available wealth at the beginning of period t , i.e., Wt; Eq. (24) suggests that the return rate of the portfolio at period t must be no less than the given minimum expected return rate level r(t); Eq. (25) requires that the risk of the return rate of the portfolio at period t must be smaller than or equal to the preset maximum risk tolerance level δt; Eq. (26) means that the diversification degree of the portfolio at period t must achieve or exceed the given diversification degree et; Eq. (27) requires that the sum of weights at period t must be unity; Eq. (28) represents that the maximum number of assets in the portfolio at period t must not exceed K, where K is an integer number in the range [1, n + 1]; Eq. (29) is the lower and upper bound constraints of xt, i, where xt, iis an integer variable. For simplifying the description, we denote the feasible region of the problem (P1) as x ∈ D in the following section.Notice that the problem (P1) has two incommensurability and conflicting objectives. To remove the effects of their incommensurability, similar to Hwang and Yoon (1981), we need to perform normalization operation on each objective as follows(30)dW=E(WT+1)−WMWPIS−WNIS,(31)dV=V(x)−VMVPIS−VNIS,whereWPIS=maxx∈DE(WT+1)andWNIS=minx∈DE(WT+1)denote the positive and negative ideal solutions of E(WT + 1), respectively;VPIS=minx∈DV(x)andVNIS=maxx∈DV(x)denote the positive and negative ideal solutions of V(x), respectively; EMand VMrepresent the middle aspiration levels for terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole holding periods, respectively. After normalization, the value of each objective function is kept in the range [0, 1]. Thus, we can compare them because their values are independent of the scale of the objective functions in the problem (P1).In practical portfolio management, experts’ knowledge and experience are very important for making portfolio decision-making. Based on experts’ knowledge, the investor may express his aspiration levels for terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole holding periods. In this paper, we employ the nonlinear S-shape membership function in Watada (2001) to express investor’s aspiration levels for the two objectives mentioned above. The S-shape membership function is given by(32)f(x)=11+exp(−θx),where θ ∈ (0, ∞) is a fuzzy parameter which measures the degree of vagueness.Then, by Eqs. (30)–(32), the membership functions of terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon can be, respectively, expressed by(33)μE(x)=11+exp(−θWdW),(34)μV(x)=11+exp(−θVdV),where θWand θVdenote as investor’s satisfaction degrees for terminal wealth and the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon, respectively. Fig. 1shows the membership function about the goal for terminal wealth. Fig. 2shows the membership function about the goal for the cumulative risk over the whole investment horizon.RemarkNotice that θWand θVdetermine the shapes of membership functions μE(x) and μV(x), respectively, where θW> 0 and θV> 0. The larger the parameters θW> 0 and θV> 0 are, the less their vagueness becomes.Based on the maximization principle in Bellman and Zadeh (1970), the following relationship can be obtained(35)η=min{μE(x),μV(x)}.Then, the bi-objective portfolio selection problem (P1) can be formulated as the following single objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (P2):(P2){maxηs.t.μE(x)≥η,μV(x)≥η,x∈D,By Eqs. (33) and (34), the problem (P2) can be rewritten in the following form:(P3){maxηs.t.η+exp(−θWdW)η≤1,η+exp(−θVdV)η≤1,x∈D.For the mix-integer nonlinear programming problem (P3), the traditional optimization approaches cannot be used to solve the multi-period portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots and cardinality constraints. For this reason, we propose a novel genetic algorithm to solve the multi-period portfolio selection optimization problem.Genetic algorithm (GA) is a kind of stochastic search technique based on the mechanism of the famous Darwin’s principal of natural selection “survival of the fittest”, which was originally proposed by Holland (1975). Due to computationally simple and powerful, genetic algorithms are often regarded as very good tool for solving different types of optimization problems since they make no restrictive assumptions about the solution space. Up to now, many researchers have used the GAs to solve complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Li and Gen (1996) and Yokota, Gen, and Li (1996) proposed genetic algorithms based on penalty function to solve mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Deep, Singh, Kansal, and Mohan (2009) designed a real code genetic algorithm for solving integer and mixed integer constrained optimization problems. Recently, some researchers use GAs for optimizing the portfolio selection problems. Lin and Liu (2008) designed a genetic algorithm with penalty function to solve portfolio selection problems with minimum transaction lots. Soleimani, Golmakani, and Salimi (2009) used genetic algorithm to solve Markowitz-based portfolio selection with minimum transaction lots, cardinality constraints and regarding sector capitalization. Baixauli-Soler et al. (2011) proposed a multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving mean-VaR portfolio selection problem with minimum transaction lots and non-linear transaction costs.In this section, we design a novel genetic algorithm on the basis of the solution algorithm in Deep et al. (2009) to solve the problem (P3). We first introduce its initialization operation, constraint-handling, evaluation function, crossover operation, selection operation, mutation operation and stopping criterion.Initialization operation: In this algorithm, we first randomly generate a solution in the range [lt, i, ut, i] for each variable xt, i. Then, we can obtain an individual, denoted it as X = (x1, 1, …, x1, n; …; xT, 1, …, xT, n). For convenience, we divide the nT components of X equally into T groups. Accordingly, the individual X can be rewritten as X = (x1, …, xT), where xt= (xt, 1, …, xt, n) for all i = 1, 2, …, n and t = 1, 2, …, T. Repeat above mentioned operation pop−size times, we can get a population.Constraint-handling: Since the randomly generated solution may not satisfy the feasible region, we need to check the feasibility of each individual. We perform the following constraints-handling operation. To ensure each component of X satisfy the integer restrict, we perform truncation operation on it. The concrete rules of the truncation operation can be summarized as follows:(i)If X is an integer number vector, thenX¯=X.If X is a real number vector, thenX¯is equal to either ⌊X⌋ or ⌊X⌋ + 1 each with probability 0.5, where ⌊X⌋ denotes as the integer part of X.To make the individual satisfy the cardinality constraint, we keep the largest K variables in each group. After truncation operation and cardinality repair, we normalize the remainder components in each group to keep them satisfy the budget constraint. Furthermore, we calculate the violent value of the individual X, denoted it as Viol(X).Evaluation function: The evaluation function of this algorithm is formulated as follows(36)eval(Xi)={f(Xi),ifXiisfeasible,fworst+∑j=1mmax{gj(Xi),0}ifotherwise,where fworst is the objective function value of the worst feasible solution at current population. From Eq. (36), we can find out that, if Xiis an infeasible solution, then its evaluation value depends on both the amount of constraint violation value and the population of solutions at hand. However, if Xiis a feasible solution, then its evaluation value is equal to the objective function value f(Xi).∑j=1mmax{gj(Xi),0}is the sum of the violent values of Xiboth inequality constraints and equality constraints (where gj(Xi) denotes as the left side term of the jth inequality constraint minus its right side term). For the equality constraints in the problem (P3), we can transform them into corresponding inequality constraints by using a tolerance. If there are no feasible solutions in the population, then fworst is set to zero. Notice that Eq. (36) is an evaluation function without penalty factor for constraint handling.For any given two solutions, we compare them by the following rules in Deb (2000):(1)A feasible solution is always preferred over an infeasible one.Between two feasible solutions, the one with better objective function is preferred.Between two infeasible solutions, the one with smaller constraint violation is preferred.Mutation operation: The mutation operation is based on power mutation in Deep and Thakur (2007b). In this process, a random number r is generated by the power distribution r = (r1)p, where r1 is a random number in (0,1) and p is the mutation index. After determining the value of s, the mutation solution is generated by(38)x={x¯−s(x¯−xl),ify<r,x¯+s(xu−x¯),ify≥r,wherey=x¯−xlxu−x¯; xland xuare the lower and upper bounds on the value of the decision variable; y is a random number in (0,1). Similar to crossover operation, we perform the constraint-handling operation on the two obtained offsprings. After checking the feasibility of the two offsprings and their parents, we select the two better individuals for next generation.Selection operation: We use the common spinning the roulette wheel technique to perform the selection operation. To do that, we can keep the better chromosomes that have more chance to produce offspring. Notice that, for the problem (P3), the chromosome with a higher objective value is better, i.e. the chromosome with a higher fitness value is better. Before performing the spinning the roulette wheel, we first introduce a rank-based evaluation function denoted by eval(Ck) to calculate the probability of Ckfor reproduction as follows:eval(Ck)=υ(1−υ)k−1,k=1,2,…,pop−size,where k = 1 is the best chromosome; k = pop−size is the worst chromosome.From the evaluation function above, the cumulative probability Pkof chromosome Ckcan be computed byP0=0,Pk=eval(C1)+eval(C2)+⋯+eval(Ck),k=1,2,…,pop−size.Then, we randomly generate a random number p ∈ [0, Pk]. The individual Ckis selected for next generation when satisfies the following relationshipPk−1≤p≤Pk,k=1,2,…,pop−size.After repeating this process pop−size times, we can obtain pop−size parents for next generation.Stopping criterion: If the stopping criterion (maximum number of iterations Gmax) is satisfied, or a given number of generations was reached without improvement of the fitness function values, then we terminate the process of iteration.The procedure of the designed algorithm can be summarized as follows:Step 1:Set parameters: population size pop−size, crossover probability Pc, mutation probability Pmand maximum iteration Gmax;Randomly generate pop−size solutions in the bound constraints of variables;Calculate the fitness value of each individual;Update the chromosomes by crossover and mutation operationsSelect the chromosomes by spinning the roulette wheel;Repeat the second to fifth steps for a given number of cycles;Terminate the repetition cycle when a given maximum number of iterations is reached.To illustrate the idea of our model and the designed algorithm, let us consider an empirical application in Chinese stock markets. Assume that there are 10 stocks and a risk-free asset in a financial market for trading. The exchange codes of the 10 stocks are 600005, 600068, 000858, 600009, 000031, 000056, 000063, 000901, 600066, 600058. For convenience of description, we denote the 10 stocks successively as Stocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in this example. An investor intends to allocate his initial wealth 100,000 CNY among the 11 assets with a time horizon of three consecutive investment periods. In this example, we suppose that the investor uses the historical data of the 10 stocks and the risk-free asset to simulate the future transaction. Here, we collect the weekly closing pricing of these stocks in six years from January 2004 to January 2010 as the sample data. We set each two years as an investment period to handle these historical data. We assume that the return rates of stocks are trapezoidal fuzzy variables. The corresponding trapezoidal possibility distributions of these stocks at each period are shown in Table 1. Assume that the market price of each stock can be reflected by its historical information. Table 2shows the market prices of these stocks at the date of transaction for each period.Assume that the transaction cost rate is 0.003, i.e., ct, i= 0.003 (t = 1, 2, 3; i = 1, 2, …, 10). The expected return rate levels of the portfolios on the three investment periods are set as 0.0245, 0.0267 and 0.0333, respectively. The return rate of risk-free asset at each period is set as 0.02. The risk tolerance levels of the portfolios on the three investment periods are set as 0.015, 0.018 and 0.024, respectively. The maximum number of assets in the portfolio at each period is set to 6, i.e., K = 6. The diversification degree of the portfolio at each period is set to 1.2. Here, we set EM= 1.12 × 105 and VM= 0.025.In this example, we consider three different values of parameters θEand θVto express different investors’ preferences, i.e., (θE, θV) = (80,20), (50,50) and (20,80). The parameters in the genetic algorithm are set as follows. The population size is set as 100. The probabilities of crossover operation and mutation operation are set as 0.8 and 0.1, respectively. The maximum generation Gmax is set as 5000. After running the genetic algorithm 5000 generations, the corresponding computational results for the three preference cases mentioned above are shown in Tables 3and 4. Table 3shows the transaction lots of the 10 stocks at each period. Table 4 gives the invested amounts of the 10 stocks and the risk-free asset at each period. The satisfaction degree η, terminal wealth, net profit and total transaction cost are summarized in Table 5.From Tables 3–5 above, we find that different investment preferences lead to different investment strategies. If preference parameter vector (θE, θV) is set as (20,80), it means that the investor requires the less vagueness on μV(X) than that on μE(X). Namely, the investor is conservative. In this case, the investor should select a risk-free asset and four stocks (i.e., Stocks 1, 2, 4 and 5) for constructing portfolio at period 1. The buying lots of the four stocks are 2, 1, 7 and 37, respectively. The investment amounts on the four stocks and the risk-free asset at period 1 are 1282.00, 193.00, 4151.00, 82 547.00 and 19 680.76 CNY, respectively. Then, at the beginning of period 2, the investor will readjust his portfolio. After adjustment, the investor will select Stocks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and the risk-free asset for constructing portfolio. The transaction lots of the six stocks are 7, 3, 5, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding investment amounts on the six stocks and the risk-free asset are 861.00, 1725.00, 4125.00, 696.00, 17 324.00, 10 824.00 and 58 940.51 CNY, respectively. Then, at the beginning period 3, the investor should adjust his portfolio again. After adjustment, Stocks 3, 7, 9 and the risk-free asset are selected for constructing portfolio. The transaction lots on the selected three stocks are 7, 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding investment amounts on the three stocks and the risk-free asset are 17 157.00, 35 792.00, 43 773.00 and 10 201.54 CNY, respectively. In this case, the obtained terminal wealth is 11 2713.18 CNY, the net profit is 12 713.18 CNY, the total transaction cost is 622.81 CNY and the investor’s satisfaction degree about the investment strategy is 0.8231. However, if the investor shows a neutral attitude toward both terminal wealth and cumulative risk, we set the preference parameter vector (θE, θV) as (50,50). The transaction lots of the 10 stocks of the three investment periods are shown in lines 5–7 in Table 4 and the corresponding investment amounts of the 11 assets in the three investment periods are given in lines 5–7 in Table 5. In this case, the terminal wealth is 112 431.37 CNY, the net profit is 12 431.37 CNY, the total transaction cost is 638.99 CNY and the investor’s satisfaction degree about the investment strategy is 0.9108. If the investor requires the less vagueness on μE(X) than that on μV(X). Here, the preference parameter vector (θE, θV) is set as (80,20). The transaction lots of the 10 stocks in the three investment periods are shown in lines 8–10 in Table 4 and the corresponding investment amounts of the 11 assets on the three investment periods are given in lines 8–10 in Table 5. The obtained terminal wealth is 112 123.27 CNY, the net profit is 12 123.27 CNY, the total transaction cost is 666.24 CNY and the satisfaction degree about the two decision objectives is 0.7432. If the investor is not satisfied with any of the obtained investment strategy, he could reset the value of θEand θV.
