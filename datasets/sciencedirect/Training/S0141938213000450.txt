@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ without or with alkali metal ions doping at a low sintering temperature were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The XRD pattern shows that all samples exhibit Zn3(BO3)2 crystalline phase. The samples co-doped with alkali metal ions have better crystallinity compared with the un-compensated ones. The different charge compensation approaches have no influence on the shape and position of the emission and excitation spectra. However, the luminescent intensity of samples has been obviously enhanced with different alkali metal ions co-doping. The introduction of Li+ can increase the red emission of Eu3+ compared with the others. Thus, the volume compensation and the equilibrium of mole number can be taken into consideration by charge compensated (CC) approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is well known that the dominant commercial routine for fabrication of white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) is the phosphor-converted LEDs (pc-LEDs) in which a single blue/NUV (near ultraviolet) LED chip is combined with multi-color phosphors. Yet the current populated phosphors, such as the red light emitting Y2O3:Eu3+ do not show an acceptable excitation respond in near UV (350–400nm) range [1]. Though this red phosphor is widely used in our daily life, it still has many disadvantages, for example, it is uneconomical because of the high price of the rare earth elements. Therefore, it is urgently to search a new red phosphor in low cost for near-UV InGaN-based WLEDs.Nowadays, borate materials capture an increasing attention because of unique properties and specific features. For examples, among the borate compounds, zinc borates with different ratio of ZnO, B2O3 and H2O have attracted much attention because of their potential applications as fluorescent lamp phosphors due to their advantages, such as their low price, environmental friendliness, high thermal stability promote them into the application in fluorescent lamps. In the past decades, the spectroscopy of zinc borate doped with Eu3+, Pr3+ and Er3+ has been reported frequently [2–4]. Recently, taking the low sintering temperatures and good luminescence properties into consideration, many efforts have been devoted to studies of Zn3(BO3)2. The crystal structure of the materials is characterized by a monoclinic structure in which BO3-triangles share common vertices with the Zn4O-tetrahedra. Due to the intrinsically luminescent, Zn3(BO3)2 compounds show thermoluminescence and other optical properties [5,6], which makes it a promising candidate for numerous practical applications. Zou et al. [7] have studied the effect of Mn2+ ions on the photoluminescence characteristics of Eu3+-doped Zn3(BO3)2 nanoparticles.However, the increment of emission intensity of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2 brought by the introduction of Mn2+ ions is still insufficient [7]. So, it is very urgent for us to enhance the red emission of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2. In this paper, we aim to prepare a series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ phosphors without or with alkali metal ions doping, and report their novel luminescence characteristics such as strong and stable visible-light emission. This observation is of great interest not only for understanding a number of fundamental physical phenomenon, but also for commercial applications in the field of the fluorescence lamps, display devices and so on. The optimum doping concentration of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2 was 8% according to our experiments. The discussion of the influence on the structure of Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ with alkali metal ions (A=Li, Na, K) doping will be also carried out.A series of samples were synthesized via high temperature solid-state reaction. The raw materials ZnO(99.0%), H3BO3(99.0%), Eu2O3(99.99%), Li2CO3(99.0%), Na2CO3(99.0%), K2CO3(99.0%) were weighed according to the stoichiometry of the Zn3(BO3)2,Zn2.76(BO3)2:Eu0.243+,Zn2.64(BO3)2Eu0.243+,Zn2.52(BO3)2:Eu0.243+,A0.24+(A=Li, Na, K). Then they were mixed evenly and milled thoroughly for 1h in agate mortar. The mixed powders were placed into corundum crucibles and calcined at 875°C for 4h in a muffle furnace in air. Eventually, after cooling down to room temperature naturally, a series of expected samples in the form of white powder were obtained. To distinguish from them, these samples are denoted as S0–S5 respectively in the following depiction.The phase identification of the samples was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ=1.5406Å) at 36kV tube voltage and 20mA tube current. The excitation and emission spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with 2.5nm slit width and 60nm per minute scanning rate under 400V. A Xe lamp with 360nm wavelength was utilized as an excitation source. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In summary, a series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ phosphors with alkali metal ions doping were prepared via traditional solid-state reaction. According to the XRD analysis, all the prepared samples can be indexed to pure phase. The samples co-doped with alkali metal ions have better crystallization than the one with sole Eu3+ doping. The different charge compensation approaches have no influence on the shape and position of the emission and excitation spectra, yet the luminescent intensity of samples has been obviously enhanced with different alkali metal ions co-doping. The introduction of Li+ can increase the red emission of Eu3+ compared with the others. Thus, the volume compensation and the equilibrium of mole number play an important role on the enhanced intensity.
