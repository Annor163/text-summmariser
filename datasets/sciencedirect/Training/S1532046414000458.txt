Cloud computing is emerging as the next-generation IT architecture. However, cloud computing also raises security and privacy concerns since the users have no physical control over the outsourced data. This paper focuses on fairly retrieving encrypted private medical records outsourced to remote untrusted cloud servers in the case of medical accidents and disputes. Our goal is to enable an independent committee to fairly recover the original private medical records so that medical investigation can be carried out in a convincing way. We achieve this goal with a fair remote retrieval (FRR) model in which either t investigation committee members cooperatively retrieve the original medical data or none of them can get any information on the medical records. We realize the first FRR scheme by exploiting fair multi-member key exchange and homomorphic privately verifiable tags. Based on the standard computational Diffieâ€“Hellman (CDH) assumption, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model (ROM). A detailed performance analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is efficient in terms of communication and computation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cloud servers (CS) can provide shared resources, software and information to remote clients over a network such as Internet. The clients can access the CS through a web browser or a smartphone application, while the business software and data are stored on the CS at a remote location. An important application of cloud computing is to store medical documents from electronic health networks (EHNs) in order to facilitate the exchange of health information between healthcare organizations, clinical research organizations, healthcare payers and public health agencies. Each day, an EHN generates and records numerous medical documents, including medical images, medical check reports, clinical reports, medical prescriptions, patient monitoring reports, and so on [1,2]. These documents are sensitive and need to be protected, so that only authorized parties can access them. It is preferable to employ cloud servers to store and maintain such a large number of medical documents, because the cloud reduces cost and offers universal accessibility.Cloud computing poses some security problems: remote data integrity checking, remote data retrieval and data privacy. For example, CS may neglect keeping or may deliberately delete rarely accessed data of some clients. Thus, it is important to enable the client to easily check the integrity of the outsourced data without downloading the entire database. Furthermore, the remotely stored data may need to be used in the future; therefore, the client must have the ability to retrieve his/her data anywhere anytime. To achieve data privacy, a general approach is to let the clients encrypt their data before uploading them to CS. The encryption can be elegantly designed to allow searching encrypted data or retrieving data with specific content. To improve the robustness of data retrieval, error-correcting codes can be used before the data are stored at the CS.
