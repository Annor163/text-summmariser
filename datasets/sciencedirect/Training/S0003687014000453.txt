@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In new approaches based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems (ANFIS) and analytical method, heart rate (HR) measurements were used to estimate oxygen consumption (VO2). Thirty-five participants performed Meyer and Flenghi's step-test (eight of which performed regeneration release work), during which heart rate and oxygen consumption were measured. Two individualized models and a General ANFIS model that does not require individual calibration were developed. Results indicated the superior precision achieved with individualized ANFIS modelling (RMSE = 1.0 and 2.8 ml/kg min in laboratory and field, respectively). The analytical model outperformed the traditional linear calibration and Flex-HR methods with field data. The General ANFIS model's estimates of VO2 were not significantly different from actual field VO2 measurements (RMSE = 3.5 ml/kg min). With its ease of use and low implementation cost, the General ANFIS model shows potential to replace any of the traditional individualized methods for VO2 estimation from HR data collected in the field.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Ergonomics and occupational health and safety researchers have demonstrated the importance of designing jobs within the physiological capacity of the workforce (Dempsey et al., 2008). Studies have shown that designing jobs based on the balance between this capacity and the energetic demands of physical jobs is key to maintaining workforce safety and productivity (Malchaire et al., 1984; Abdelhamid, 1999; Wu and Wang, 2002; Dempsey et al., 2008). Oxygen consumption (VO2) reflects energy expenditure (EE) associated with physically demanding jobs (Malchaire et al., 1984; Smolander et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2002; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008). Since direct measurement of VO2 requires sophisticated and costly devices, is invasive and often not practical in actual work environments, attempts have been made to find alternative feasible estimation methods (e.g., ISO-8996, 2004; Smolander et al., 2008). Many researchers have reported a linear relationship between oxygen consumption and heart rate for a wide variety of activities (Wyndham et al., 1962; Poulsen and Asmussen, 1962; McArdle et al., 1971; Rodahl et al., 1974; Evans et al., 1983; Gordon et al., 1983; Astrand and Rodahl, 1986). Hence, determining an individual's VO2–HR relationship (calibration curve) has become a very common practice to assess VO2 from HR data (Smolander et al., 2008). This calibration process involves measuring an individual's HR and VO2 while performing a graded exercise, such as treadmill, stationary bicycle or step-test. The linear relationship between the two variables is then modelled using graphical or linear regression analysis. The model is then used to estimate VO2 from HR data collected in the field for the same individual.One major criticism of this method is the difficulty of establishing individual calibration curves at workplaces with large working populations. Even though the calibration procedure is simple, it is time consuming (at least 45 min per individual), requires a trained practitioner, and requires access to a controlled environment. Another criticism is the fact that at low activity levels (low workload intensity), the relationship between HR and VO2 is nonlinear and often deviates from the calibration curve and thus may produce inaccurate estimates of VO2 (Abdelhamid, 1999; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008; Smolander et al., 2008). In recent years, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been proposed as alternatives to conventional statistical methods (Jang et al., 1997; Kaya et al., 2003; Yildirim and Bayramoglu, 2006). One of the most effective AI techniques, particularly for function approximation and pattern recognition, is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It combines the unique ability of fuzzy logic to make decisions in uncertain conditions with the learning and adaptive capabilities of artificial neural networks (Kaya et al., 2003). ANFIS has consistently been demonstrated effective in solving nonlinear function approximation problems, particularly in biomedical engineering (Güler and Übeyli, 2004, 2005; Übeyli and Güler, 2005a,b).The primary objective of the present study is to develop a fuzzy-based general model for VO2 estimation from HR that does not require individual calibration and hence can be used quickly and easily by practitioners in actual workplaces. The secondary objective is to develop individualized models based on fuzzy logic and analytical methods that provide higher accuracy VO2 estimates for laboratory and small population work environments applications. The proposed models are expected to improve handling of the nonlinearity and uncertainty involved in VO2 estimation. Heart rate and VO2 measurements performed in a laboratory environment and in the field were used to develop and test the proposed models. Their performance was compared with traditional individual methods, namely linear calibration (Schulz et al., 1989; Bouchard and Trudeau, 2008) and Flex-HR (Spurr et al., 1988; Ceesay et al., 1989) methods.
