@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Conventional two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) models measure the overall performance of a production system composed of two stages (processes) in a specified period of time, where variations in different periods are ignored. This paper takes the operations of individual periods into account to develop a multi-period two-stage DEA model, which is able to measure the overall and period efficiencies at the same time, with the former expressed as a weighted average of the latter. Since the efficiency of a two-stage system in a period is the product of the two process efficiencies, the overall efficiency of a decision making unit (DMU) in the specified period of time can be decomposed into the process efficiency of each period. Based on this decomposition, the sources of inefficiency in a DMU can be identified. The efficiencies measured from the model can also be used to calculate a common-weight global Malmquist productivity index (MPI) between two periods, in that the overall MPI is the product of the two process MPIs. The non-life insurance industry in Taiwan is used to verify the proposed model, and to explain why some companies performed unsatisfactorily in the specified period of time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Two-stage production systems are often encountered in the real world where the system has two stages (processes) connected in series, in which the inputs are supplied from outside to the first process, which then produces some intermediate products for the second process to produce the final outputs. Many applications of this type of system have been reported, for example, commercial banks in Bangladesh (Akther et al., 2013), the sustainable design performance of automobile manufacturers in the US (Chen et al., 2012), the development of China’s coastal areas (Chiu et al., 2011), airline companies in the US (Lu et al., 2012), and mutual fund families in the US (Premachandra et al., 2012). Cook et al. (2010) and Kao and Hwang (2010) present reviews of the related works.Fig. 1shows the structure of a two-stage production system, where Xi, i=1,…,m, Zf, f=1,…,g, and Yr, r=1,…,s, are the inputs, intermediate products, and outputs, respectively. If the internal processes are ignored, that is, one merely looks at the inputs used by the system, Xi, and the outputs produced by the system, Yr, then the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique proposed by Charnes et al. (1978) can be used to measure the relative efficiency of a set of n units, referred to as decision making units (DMUs), with the same type of production. The model is:(1)EkCCR=max∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,nur,vi⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,where urand viare virtual multipliers and ε is a small non-Archimedean number used to avoid ignoring any factor in calculating efficiency (Charnes and Cooper, 1984). Since the efficiency is measured under the most favorable conditions of the DMU being evaluated, the results are persuasive and acceptable by all DMUs.Without taking the operations of the internal processes into account, an unreasonable result may occur in which the system is efficient while the two processes are not. For this reason, several models that take the operations of the processes into consideration when measuring the system efficiency have been developed, with the network model of Färe and Grosskopf (2000) being the most widely applied. Kao (2009a) classified such models into independent, connected, and relational ones. Recent studies focus on relational models, because they are able to measure the system and process efficiencies at the same time, and there is a mathematical relationship between them (Chen et al., 2009; Kao and Hwang, 2008; Tone and Tsutsui, 2009). No matter which model is used, the objective is usually to measure the efficiency of a DMU in a specified period of time.When the period of time is composed of clearly defined units, such as years, then the data for the inputs, intermediate products, and outputs over the specified period of time can be aggregated in the analysis. For example, Kao and Hwang (2008) used two-year totals to evaluate the efficiency of non-life insurance companies in Taiwan. More often, the average data is used, and one example is Portela et al. (2012), which uses the average results of basic education exams in 2005 and 2006 to measure the performance of Portuguese secondary schools. Since DEA has a unit-invariant property (Lovell and Pastor, 1995), the efficiencies measured from these two types of data, total and average, are the same. If the aggregate data is used, then the resulting efficiency is an overall measure of the performance of the specified period of time. Similar to the case that ignoring the operations of individual processes will result in misleading results, ignoring the operations of individual periods may also produce unreasonable ones. For example, the results may suggest that a DMU is efficient in an overall sense, although every period is inefficient. While one can use the existing two-stage models to calculate the efficiency of each period independently, and then aggregate them to represent the overall performance, there is still a problem with regard how to aggregate the efficiency of individual periods. This paper thus proposes a multi-period model which is able to measure the overall and period efficiencies at the same time, and derive a mathematical relationship between them. The resulting relationship indicates that a DMU in the specified period of time is efficient only if it is efficient in all individual periods.The proposed model is also able to calculate a common-weight global Malmquist productivity index (MPI) for measuring performance changes between two periods. Since this MPI uses the same frontier facet to calculate efficiencies, the results are more comparable among different DMUs as compared to those calculated from the conventional MPI.This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, a model for measuring the overall and period efficiencies at the same time is developed. This model may produce multiple solutions, and an approach for determining a solution is described in Section 3. After that, a common-weight global MPI is proposed in Section 4 to measure changes in performance between two periods. An example of the non-life insurance industry in Taiwan is then used to illustrate this approach in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, some conclusions are drawn from the discussion.Suppose the time span for measuring the efficiency of a set of n DMUs, that have a two-stage structure, covers q periods. LetXij(p),Zfj(p), andYrj(p)denote the inputs, intermediate products, and outputs of DMU j in period p, respectively, with totals ofXij=∑p=1qXij(p),Zfj=∑p=1qZfj(p), andYrj=∑p=1qYrj(p). Fig. 2is a graphical representation of such a system, and is referred to as a multi-period two-stage production system.The relational model in Kao and Hwang (2008) for measuring the system (overall) and process efficiencies of the kth DMU for two-stage systems is to take the operations of the two processes into consideration in addition to that of the system defined in the conventional DEA Model (1), where the operation is described by the constraint of requiring the aggregate output to be less than or equal to the aggregate input:(2)E^kS=max∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑f=1gwfZfj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj-∑f=1gwfZfj⩽0,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gSince the sum of the third and fourth constraints is equal to the second constraint for each DMU, the second set of constraints are redundant, and can be deleted. After an optimal solutionur∗,vi∗,wf∗is obtained, the system efficiency,E^kS, and two process efficiencies,E^kIandE^kII, are calculated as:(3)E^kS=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗XikE^kI=∑f=1gwf∗Zfk∑i=1mvi∗XikE^kII=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑f=1gwf∗ZfkClearly, the system efficiency is the product of the two process efficiencies,E^kS=E^kI×E^kII.SinceE^kS,E^kI, andE^kIIare calculated from the totals of the inputs, intermediate products, and outputs in all q periods, they represent the overall performance of that period of time. Intuitively, they are the aggregation of the efficiencies of individual periods, and it would be desirable to know the mechanism of the aggregation, so that the period that has the most impact on the overall performance can be identified. For this purpose, the operations of each period must be taken into account in measuring the overall efficiency.The operations of each period are described by∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0, and∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0. Adding these three sets of constraints to Model (2) yields the following:(4)EkS=max∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1ur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gA.Systemconstraints:∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nB.Process1constraints:∑f=1gwfZfj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nC.Process2constraints:∑r=1surYrj-∑f=1gwfZfj⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nNote that one of the three groups of constraints, A, B, and C, is redundant; moreover, the first set of constraints in each group is also redundant, and can be deleted. At optimality, the overall efficiencies of q periods for the systemEkSand two processes (EkIandEkII), and the efficiencies of periodpEkS(p)and its two processes (EkI(p)andEkII(p)), based on Model (4), are:(5)EkS=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗XikEkI=∑f=1gwf∗Zfk∑i=1mvi∗XikEkII=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑f=1gwf∗ZfkEkS(p)=∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)EkI(p)=∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)EkII(p)=∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)Similar to the case of Eq. (3), here the overall efficiency of q periods for the system is also the product of those of its two processes,EkS=EkI×EkII; moreover, the efficiency of each period is the product of those of its two processes,EkS(p)=EkI(p)×EkII(p). Since more constraints have been included,EkS,EkI, andEkIImeasured from the multi-period Model (4) are smaller than those measured from the aggregate Model (2).A closer examination of Fig. 2 reveals that the multi-period two-stage system has a parallel structure of q subsystems, where each subsystem corresponds to one period and is composed of two processes connected in series. According to Kao (2009b), the parallel structure has a property that the system efficiency is a weighted average of the subsystem efficiencies, where the weight is the proportion of the aggregate input of the corresponding subsystem in that of all q subsystems. Applying this property to the system efficiencyEkSand process efficienciesEkIandEkIIobtains the following relationships:(6)EkS=∑p=1qω(p)EkS(p),ω(p)=∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗XikEkI=∑p=1qω(p)EkI(p),ω(p)=∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗XikEkII=∑p=1qϖ(p)EkII(p),ϖ(p)=∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)∑f=1gwf∗ZfkThese relationships can be verified easily:∑p=1qω(p)EkS(p)=∑p=1q∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)=∑p=1q∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik=EkS∑p=1qω(p)EkI(p)=∑p=1q∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik(p)=∑p=1q∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik=EkI∑p=1qϖ(p)EkII(p)=∑p=1q∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)∑f=1gwf∗Zfk∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑f=1gwf∗Zfk(p)=∑p=1q∑r=1sur∗Yrk(p)∑f=1gwf∗Zfk=EkIIWe thus conclude that the overall efficiency in q periods is a weighted average of the efficiencies of the q individual periods, and each DMU being evaluated selects the most favorable weights to form the overall efficiency from period efficiencies.Altogether, we have two ways to decompose the system efficiency into the process efficiencies of each period:(7)EkS=EkI×EkII=∑p=1qω(p)EkI(p)∑p=1qϖ(p)EkII(p)EkS=∑p=1qω(p)EkS(p)=∑p=1qω(p)EkI(p)×EkII(p)This decomposition indicates that a multi-period two-stage system is efficient if and only if all its period-specific processes are. As a result, it identifies the processes that cause the inefficiency of the system, and thus provides a direction for making improvements to it.One attractive aspect of efficiency decomposition is that it identifies the source of inefficiency in a system. It also shows the relative performance of a period (or process) of a DMU compared with that of other DMUs. However, due to multiple solutions, the decomposition may not be unique, which makes the efficiencies of different DMUs not comparable. A common basis for measuring the efficiencies is thus necessary.In order to make the process efficiencies of different DMUs comparable, Kao and Hwang (2008) suggested maximizing the efficiency of the process to be compared, while maintaining the system efficiency at the value obtained previously. Following this idea, in comparing the efficiency of period t, one should find the maximum efficiency of this period for each DMU, while maintaining the system efficiency at the level ofEkScalculated from Model (4). That is:(8)EkS(t)=max∑r=1surYrk(t)s.t.∑i=1mviXik(t)=1∑r=1surYrk=EkS∑i=1mviXik∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gNote that in this formulation all redundant constraints have been deleted. Since every DMU is given the first priority to determine the efficiency of period t that, together with other period efficiencies, form the fixed overall efficiencyEkS,EjS(t),j=1,…,n, have a common basis for comparison. If period h is of second concern, then one simply finds the maximum efficiency of this period, while maintaining the overall efficiency atEkSand the efficiency of period t atEkS(t). This process can be continued to find the efficiencies of the periods of lower-priority concerns.In each period there are two processes. To make the process-specific efficiency of a period comparable among all DMUs, the same idea can be applied. Suppose decision makers are more concerned with process one than process two. Then one simply maximizes the efficiency of process one, while requiring the overall and period t efficiencies to beEkSandEkS(t), respectively. The corresponding model is:(9)EkI(t)=max∑f=1gwfZfk(t)s.t.∑i=1mviXik(t)=1∑r=1surYrk=EkS∑i=1mviXik∑r=1surYrk(t)=EkS(t)∑i=1mviXik(t)∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gAfter all of the periods and processes for which the corresponding efficiencies are to be compared have been enumerated via the above process, an optimal solutionur∗,vi∗,wf∗is determined from the multiple solutions to calculate different types of efficiencies via Eq. (5) and the weights via Eq. (6).Top managers are usually interested in performance changes between two periods for multi-period problems, because the results are able to provide directions for achieving better performance. A measure that has been widely used for this purpose is the Malmquist productivity index (MPI).Different forms of the MPI have been proposed in the literature. Suppose the efficiencies of periods t and h are to be compared, where h is later than t. The idea of Caves et al. (1982) is to use the technology of period t to measure the efficiencies of periods t and h, and take the ratio of the latter to the former as the MPI. A value greater than, equal to, or less than 1 indicates that the performance has improved, remained the same, or worsened between periods t and h, respectively. Since period h can also be used as the basis for measuring efficiency, and the results may not be the same as those obtained from using period t as the basis, Färe et al. (1994) proposed using both periods, but separately, to calculate two Cave’s MPIs, and use their geometric average to be the MPI. This MPI can be decomposed into two parts to show efficiency and technological changes.Both Cave’s and Färe’s MPIs use the technology of one period to measure efficiency. Pastor and Lovell (2005) proposed a global MPI, which uses the global technology of all q periods to measure efficiency. The MPI between two periods is the ratio of the efficiencies of these two periods. Since the observations of all q periods are used to construct the efficiency frontier for measuring efficiency, the MPI possesses an attractive property of circularity (Pastor and Lovell, 2007). That is, the MPI between periods t and h, denoted as MPIt,h, is the product of MPIt,dand MPId,h, where d is any period between t and h. This property ensures a consistent measure of performance changes between periods t and h based on any period.For multi-period two-stage systems the global technology is defined by:∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,∀j;∑f=1gwfZfj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,∀j;∑r=1surYrj-∑f=1gwfZfj⩽0,∀j;∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,∀p,j;∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,∀p,j;∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,∀p,j.By deleting redundant constraints, it reduces to:∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,∀p,j;∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,∀p,j.Suppose the MPI between periods t and h are desired. The efficiency of period t is calculated via the following DEA model:(10)E∼kS(t)=max∑r=1surYrk(t)s.t.∑i=1mviXik(t)=1∑f=1gwfZfj(p)-∑i=1mviXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj(p)-∑f=1gwfZfj(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gThe efficiency of periodh,E∼kS(h), can be calculated similarly. The global MPI isMP∼IS(t,h)=E∼kS(h)/E∼kS(t).Comparing Model (4) (with the redundant constraints deleted) with Model (10), it is noted that they have the same constraints, which implies that the same technology is defined. The only difference is that the former measures the overall efficiencyEkS, and uses Eq. (5) to obtain period efficienciesEkS(t)andEkS(h), whereas the latter measuresE∼kS(t)andE∼kS(h)directly and independently. To measureE∼kS(t)andE∼kS(h)independently implies that different sets of multipliers, or different frontier facets, have been used to measure efficiency. The efficienciesEkS(t)andEkS(h), in contrast, are measured from the same set of multipliers, indicating that they are measured based on the same frontier facet. In other words, the MPIs calculated from the efficiencies obtained from Model (4) are common-weight global MPIs. Many scholars believe that efficiencies calculated from different frontier facets are not comparable, and thus propose different approaches to generate common-weight measures (Doyle and Green, 1994; Friedman and Sinuany-Stern, 1997; Kao, 2010; Kao and Hung, 2005; Roll et al., 1991; Sinuany-Stern and Friedman, 1998; Sueyoshi, 2001). From this point of view, the common-weight global MPI calculated from the ratio ofEkS(h)toEkS(t), i.e.,MPIkS(t,h)=EkS(h)/EkS(t), is a more appropriate measure of performance changes than that calculated from the ratio ofE∼kS(h)toE∼kS(t). Note that the period efficiency calculated from Model (4) will never exceed that calculated from Model (10), because the former is more restrictive in selecting frontier facets to measure efficiency.By the same token, changes in performance for process one (and two) between periods t and h can also be measured by a common-weight global MPI calculated from the ratio ofEkI(h)(orEkII(h)) toEkI(t)(orEkII(t)), i.e.,MPIkI(t,h)=EkI(h)/EkI(t)(orMPIkII(t,h)=EkII(h)/EkII(t)). This leads to the following relationship between period and process MPIs:(11)MPIkS(t,h)=EkS(h)EkS(t)=EkI(h)×EkII(h)EkI(t)×EkII(t)=MPIkI(t,h)×MPIkII(t,h)That is, the period MPI between two periods is the product of the two process MPIs between the same periods. Changes in period performance can thus be attributed to changes in process performances. Lee and Johnson (2011) proposed the same idea for decomposing the period MPI into the process MPIs. However, they overlooked the phenomenon of multiple solutions, and the decomposition thus does not show the correct relationship.Kao and Hwang (2008) study the performance of the non-life insurance industry in Taiwan, with the whole production process divided into two stages, premium acquisition and profit generation. The first stage is characterized by marketing of the insurance, where clients are attracted to pay direct written premiums and reinsurance premiums are received from other insurance companies. The second stage is characterized by investment, where premiums are invested in a portfolio to earn profit. For this two-stage production system, the inputs Xi, intermediate products Zf, and outputs Yrused by Kao and Hwang (2008) are:Operating expenses (X1): salaries of the employees and various types of costs incurred in daily operations.Insurance expenses (X2): expenses paid to agencies, brokers, and solicitors, and other expenses associated with marketing the service of insurance.Direct written premiums (Z1): premiums received from insured clients.Reinsurance premiums (Z2): premiums received from ceding companies.Underwriting profit (Y1): profit earned from the insurance business.Investment profit (Y2): profit earned from the investment portfolio.Twenty-four companies are evaluated in Kao and Hwang (2008), with the data taken from 2001 and 2002.In order to have a more general discussion, data from one more year, 2000, is included in the current study. Since some observations of one company in 2000 (Tai Ping) and two companies in 2002 (China Mariners and Royal & Sun Alliance) are missing, they are excluded to leave twenty-one companies for this study. Table 1shows the total inputs, intermediate products, and outputs of the twenty-one companies in the three years 2000–2002. All values are in 1,000 Taiwan dollars (1 USD≅30 NTD). The complete data set for all three years is shown in the Appendix.By using the aggregate data contained in Table 1, the system (overall) and two process efficiencies of the twenty-one companies are measured via Model (2), with the results shown in the left part of Table 2under the heading “Aggregate Model.” As expected, the overall efficiency,E^kS, is the product of the two process efficiencies,E^kIandE^kII. None of the twenty-one companies are efficient, even though there are three companies which are efficient in the first process and two in the second. In an overall sense, the best three companies are Fubon (No. 3), Chung Kuo (No. 2), and Union (No. 10), whereas the worst three are Central (No. 7), Mitsui Sumitomo (No. 21), and Kuo Hua (No. 9).If the variations in individual periods are considered, the multi-period Model (4) can be applied to measure different kinds of efficiencies. Since there are three periods, and multiple solutions may occur, we maximize the efficiency of year 2000 first via Model (8), and year 2001 second to provide a common basis for these three years to be comparable among different companies. The right part of Table 2 under the heading “Multi-period Model” shows the system (overall) and two process efficiencies in the three-year period. The efficiencies measured from this model are smaller than those measured from the aggregate model for each company, as more constraints are involved. However, the rankings of the twenty-one companies measured from the two models are quite similar. For example, the best three and worst three companies measured by this model are the same as those measured from the aggregate model, although the rankings are a little different. A Spearman rank correlation test (Daniel, 1978) shows that the rankings obtained from the two models based on the overall efficiencies are highly correlated, with an rsstatistic equal to 0.9402 and the corresponding p value less than 0.001. For the two processes, process one in general has a better performance than process two, as indicated by the average efficiencies shown in the last row of Table 2, as noted in Kao and Hwang (2008). It is also noted that companies with a high process two efficiency, e.g., Chung Kuo (No. 2), Fubon (No. 3), Union (No. 10), and Asia (No. 19), also have good overall performance.Table 3shows the detailed results obtained from the multi-period Model (4). As indicated in Eq. (6), the efficiencies of the overall and two processes of the three-year period are weighted averages of those of the three years. Using Taiwan Fire (No. 1) to illustrate this, the weighted average of the three period efficiencies is 0.3354×0.3357+0.3177×0.4259+0.3468×0.4887, or 0.4174, which is exactly the overall efficiency of the three-year period shown in the first entry of the third-to-last column of Table 2. This relationship also applies to the two processes, in that 0.3354×0.8305+0.3177×0.8887+0.3468×0.9816 is equal to 0.9014 for process one and 0.3090×0.4043+0.3133×0.4792+0.3777×0.4978 is equal to 0.4631 for process two.Based on Eq. (5), the period efficiencyEkS(p)is the product of the two process efficiencies (EkI(p)andEkII(p)), which corresponds to 0.3357=0.8305×0.4043, 0.4259=0.8889×0.4792, and 0.4887=0.9816×0.4978 for the three periods for Taiwan Fire. From Eq. (11), the MPI of a company between two periods is the product of those of the two processes between the same periods. For Taiwan Fire, we have 1.2685=1.0701×1.1854, 1.1474=1.1045×1.0388, and 1.4555=1.1820×1.2314 during 2000–2001, 2001–2002, and 2000–2002, respectively. Moreover, the circular property shows that the MPI during 2000–2002 is the product of those during 2000–2001 and 2001–2002: 1.4555=1.2685×1.1474 for the company, 1.1820=1.0701×1.1045 for process one, and 1.2314=1.1854×1.0388 for process two.The numbers, in bold, in the last three rows of Table 3 are the averages of the twenty-one companies of the corresponding entries of the three years. The three average period efficiencies, 0.2555 for 2000, 0.3065 for 2001, and 0.2334 for 2002, indicate that year 2001 has the best performance. The average MPI during 2000–2002, 1.4215, indicates that the general performance of the twenty-one companies from 2000 to 2002 has improved. The average MPIs for 2000–2001, 2.9742, and 2001–2002, 0.8567, further indicate that this improvement is due to the large improvement in 2000–2001, followed by a small decline in 2001–2002.The efficiencies in Table 3 also show the sources of inefficiency for each company in the three-year period. For example, Chung Kuo (No. 2) has an overall efficiency of 0.5199, as shown in Table 2. Table 3 indicates that the inefficient part (1-0.5199) is caused by the relatively unsatisfactory performances in 2001 (with an efficiency score of 0.4943) and 2002 (with an efficiency score of 0.3475), and these are due to the unsatisfactory performances in process two. Based on results like this, a company may design more suitable strategies to improve its performance.
