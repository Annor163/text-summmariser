@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Fatty Liver Disease (FLD) is a progressively prevalent disease that is present in about 15% of the world population. Normally benign and reversible if detected at an early stage, FLD, if left undetected and untreated, can progress to an irreversible advanced liver disease, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure, which can cause death. Ultrasound (US) is the most widely used modality to detect FLD. However, the accuracy of US-based diagnosis depends on both the training and expertise of the radiologist. US-based Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) techniques for FLD detection can improve accuracy, speed and objectiveness of the diagnosis, and thereby, reduce operator dependability. In this paper, we first review the advantages and limitations of different diagnostic methods which are currently available to detect FLD. We then review the state-of-the-art US-based CAD techniques that utilize a range of image texture based features like entropy, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Haralick textures and run length matrix in several automated decision making algorithms. These classification algorithms are trained using the features extracted from the patient data in order for them to learn the relationship between the features and the end-result (FLD present or absent). Subsequently, features from a new patient are input to these trained classifiers to determine if he/she has FLD. Due to the use of such automated systems, the inter-observer variability and the subjectivity of associated with reading images by radiologists are eliminated, resulting in a more accurate and quick diagnosis for the patient and time and cost savings for both the patient and the hospital.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fatty Liver (Steatosis) or Fatty Liver Disease (FLD) indicates accumulation of triglycerides (fat) in the liver. Fatty liver can occur with or without the intake of alcohol. In 1980, Ludwig et al. [76] named it as Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) when the fatty liver condition is independent of alcohol intake. FLD has been associated to metabolic syndrome [127], and hence it leads to several diffuse and prevalent pathologies, such as diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The accumulation of fat in the liver may eventually lead to inflammation, condition called as alcoholic or non-alcoholic steatohepatisis (ASH or NASH) and finally to cirrhosis (which describes large scale liver degeneration associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [95,116,19]. Studies revealed that the prevalence of FLD depends on sex [99], ethnicity [37], and age [52]. Overall, FLD affects about 15% of the world population [37,98]), and it is the most common reason for elevated liver enzymes and chronic liver disease in developed countries [18]. Early diagnosis of FLD is of paramount importance to prevent its degeneration into irreversible liver diseases, such as liver cancer [117] and acute liver failure [146]. FLD is also a major risk factor for heart attacks and stroke [138,139]. Furthermore, advanced liver diseases result in higher health care utilization, which implies higher cost for the health care provider [14].Even though detection of FLD is easy, the differential diagnosis of FLD is difficult [149]. In fact, FLD might be linked to different factors, such as infections, inflammations, and drug or toxin-related injuries. Hepatic steatosis is usually categorized as macrovesicular or microvesicular [149]. Macrovesicular steatosis is a common occurrence in ambulatory patients, and microvesicular steatosis is associated with severe mitochondrial injury and acute hepatic dysfunction [149]. Therefore, liver biopsy is the preferred diagnostic technique for FLD detection [100]. However, biopsy is invasive, and it causes anxiety and discomfort to patients due to pain and the possibility of bleeding/hemorrhage [80]. These complications occur in at least 1.3% of all cases and the mortality ranges from 0.1% to 0.5% [17]. Given the relatively high prevalence of FLD in the general population, minimal invasive procedures have been developed for FLD diagnosis and the assessment of its degree of severity. Among all noninvasive techniques, Ultrasound (US) is the most common and widely used imaging modality for FLD diagnosis, because it is (a) inexpensive, (b) emits no harmful radiation, (c) is widely available and (d) has high sensitivity. A major downside of this imaging modality is the operator dependability [135]. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been and are being developed as adjunct techniques to reduce operator dependability and to get reproducible results [30,39,113,125,49,144]. Therefore, developing CAD systems that detect early stage FLD is of utmost importance to: (a) save patients from unwanted anxiety, (b) increase the chance of recovery and (c) reduce the cost associated with providing treatments for advanced liver diseases [7].In this paper, we first review the advantages and limitations of current modalities that are used for FLD detection (Section 2). Subsequently, we discuss the structure of an US-based CAD system and briefly describe the features that are extracted from the US images and the commonly used classification algorithms (Section 3). We then review the methodology and evaluation results of several CAD systems proposed in the literature (Section 4). In these techniques, first informative features are extracted from the US images. The features are used as input to train automated decision making systems. Coupling feature extraction with automated classification provides a way to evaluate the features in a practical setting, i.e. it is a way to find out how useful these features are for a working radiologist. After careful analysis of the literature, we found that the US-based CAD techniques for FLD can improve accuracy, speed and objectiveness of the diagnosis, and thereby, reduce operator dependability. We conclude the paper in Section 5.
