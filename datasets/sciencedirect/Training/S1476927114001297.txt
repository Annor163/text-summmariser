@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Different protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) in OmpF and OmpC promote the large-­scale deviation in protein structure and dynamics.Either E296(D299) or D312(315) should be charged to preserve L3 motion.OmpC is more resistant to different protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) than OmpF.The tip of L3 controls pore cavity in bothporins.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, the structural and dynamic properties of two major porins (OmpF and OmpC) in Escherichia coli are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both porins have the extracellular loop L3 folded halfway through the pore to form a constriction area. The solute influx and efflux are controlled by the L3 movement. E296 and D312 in OmpF and homologous D299 and D315 in OmpC located on the barrel wall are found to play a key role in L3 gating activity. All possible charged states of both E296(D299) and D312(315) are applied in this study to observe changes in overall structure and especially L3 movement. The results show that different protonation states of both residues cause the large-scale deviations in structure and pore cavity especially in OmpF. Fully charged E296(D299) and D312(315) increase the protein flexibility significantly. Deprotonating at least one of E296(D299) and D312(315) helps to fasten L3 to the barrel wall and maintain pore size. Lacking of interactions with D312(315) can lead to the pore closure in OmpF. Comparing with OmpC, not only is OmpF less stable, but it is also more sensitive to the charge states of both E296(D299) and D312(315).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Porins are water-filled pore-forming proteins that reside in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. They control the influx and efflux of nutrients and metabolites (Malek and Maghari, 2007; Nikaido, 2003). Especially, porins also serve as an entryway for many antibiotics (Basle et al., 2004; Alcaraz et al., 2004; Saint et al., 1996; Schulz, 2002; Kojima and Nikaido, 2013; Nestorovich et al., 2003; Todt et al., 1992; Bonvin et al., 2000). Most porins are homotrimers and are extremely stable in a wide range of pH, organic solvents, chaotropic salts, and detergents (Phale et al., 1998). The most conspicuous structural aspect of the trimeric porins is the presence of the constriction region or ‘eyelet’ located within the hourglass-shaped channel which is lined with charged residues. This feature is conserved in general diffusion porins and is found to be important physiologically (Kindal et al., 2002). One of the most studied porins is the outer membrane protein F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli. It consists of 16 antiparallel β strands connected by turns at the periplasmic side and loops at the extracellular side (Cowan et al., 1995; Cowan et al., 1992; Hoenger et al., 1993; Darden et al., 1993; Im and Roux, 2002a; Miedema et al., 2006; Varma et al., 2006). One of the loops (L3) is folded into the lumen in each monomer. This folded L3 creates a constriction area halfway through the pore Fig. 1.In this constriction site, a strong electric field is present due to the acidic residues on L3 and the basic residues on the opposite barrel wall. This strong electric field is essential for a pore conductance. Besides, there is the so-called latching loop (L2) reaching over to the neighbouring monomers to stabilize a trimeric form.These structural features are also conserved in the outer membrane protein C (OmpC). OmpC shares 77% sequence similarity to OmpF and it shows similar porin architecture and secondary structure element (Kumar et al., 2010). Key residues for structure and function found in OmpF are also conserved in OmpC. Despite very similar structure, OmpC is found somewhat more cation selective and has smaller pore size (Nikaido, 2003; Nikaido, 2003). Besides, OmpC is less voltage sensitive therefore it requires higher voltage for pore closure (Schulz, 2002; Saint et al., 1996). Thus, OmpC is preferentially expressed under extreme conditions (e.g., high temperature, toxic agents, or osmolarity), whereas OmpF is repressed (Forst et al., 1989). Moreover, both porins also show different characteristics in solute uptake (Saint et al., 1996), but the origin of these differences is not well understood.OmpF have been widely studied since the 20th century. Some key residues for both trimer stability and transport function were identified. For example, a series of saltbridges, E71(from adjacent monomer)-R100 and E71-R132, was found to involve in trimer stability (the locations of these residues are shown in Fig. 6) (Liu and Delcour, 1998a; Liu et al., 2000; Phale et al., 1998; Varma et al., 2006). Moreover, the effects of constriction loop L3 on pore gating activity are also of interest (Benz et al., 1985; Cowan et al., 1992; Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994). The movement of L3 was found to play a role in ion selectivity and pore cavity (Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994). Based on the crystal structure (Cowan et al., 1992), The tip of L3 is expected to interact with the opposite barrel wall via hydrogen bonds involving E117 on L3 and 2 other residues E296 and D312 on the adjacent wall (see Fig. 6 for locations). Several OmpF experiments revealed that D312 and E296 on the opposite barrel wall are crucial for L3 flexibility (Basle et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 1992; Karshikoff et al., 1994; Liu and Delcour, 1998a). All key residues for both structure and function are also conserved in OmpC as seen in Fig. 1E. Like OmpF, OmpC employs L3 for gating activity. Based on key residues found for trimer stability and function, the electrostatic interactions seem to be the major driving force. Therefore, the charge states of key ionisable residues become important. Previous pKa calculations of OmpF indicated the uncommon charge states of important residues such as E296 and D312 (Karshikoff et al., 1994). Many studies suggested possible charged states of the two residues. Initially, both E296 and D312 were computationally found to be protonated at physiological pH (Im and Roux, 2002b; Karshikoff et al., 1994; Miedema et al., 2006; Alcaraz et al., 2009; Tieleman and Berendsen, 1998; Schirmer and Phale, 1999; Humphrey et al., 1996). Later, protonating either E296 or D312 and deprotonating both residues were also employed in some simulations (Varma et al., 2006; van der Straaten et al., 2002; Biro et al., 2010). Nonetheless, based on a previous patch clamp study, deprotonating D312 only becomes more reasonable (Liu and Delcour, 1998a). The patch clamp work revealed that the D315A mutation in OmpC (D315 is homologous to D312 in OmpF) resulted in an increase in the frequency of pore closures. This indicates the key role of charged D315 on tethering L3 to the opposite wall. Hence, it is thought that homologous D312 in OmpF should act in the same manner. To date, it seems that the suitable charge states of the two residues and especially clear molecular details responding to different protonation states remain obscure. So, this study aims at understanding the structural responses when all possible protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(D315) are applied in both OmpF and OmpC (the residue number in a bracket represents the homologous residue number of OmpC). The differences in structure and dynamics (especially the trimeric stability and L3 motion) affected by different protonation states of the two are investigated.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used in a number of earlier studies to investigate the dynamic properties of OmpF. A 1ns MD study of the trimeric OmpF revealed deviations of dynamical structure relative to the crystal structure. It also showed that L3 flexibility affected a change in pore cavity (Humphrey et al., 1996). MD simulations were also successfully used to observe the solute (such as antibiotics) passage through OmpF in comparison with experiments (Malek and Maghari, 2007; Kumar et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2013; Ziervogel and Roux, 2013; Mahendran et al., 2010). OmpF are computationally well studied whereas few computational studies on OmpC are found. Recently, the accelerated MD has revealed the antibiotic permeations through both OmpC and OmpF (Kumar et al., 2010). They observed the more extended but narrower constriction area and the more antibiotic specificity of OmpC (Kumar et al., 2010). Furthermore, MD simulations were used to study the influence of protonation states of titratable residues on the OmpF function (Im and Roux, 2002a; Im and Roux, 2002b; Varma et al., 2006; van der Straaten et al., 2003; Berendsen et al., 1984). It appears that key aspects of the protein behavior can be captured on the MD timescale. Therefore, MD simulations are employed in this study to examine the effect of different protonation states of E296 and D312 (homologous to D299 and D315 in OmpC) on trimer stability and L3 activity in both porins in atomic level. This study has no intention to predict the suitable charge states for the two key residues. It is aimed at understanding the nature of OmpF and OmpC in microscopic detail when some unusual charged residues suggested from previous studies are applied. This study may partially reflect the structural responses from both porins at different pH.The trimeric OmpC (2J1N, resolution 2.0Å) and OmpF (2OMF, resolution 2.4Å) crystal structures consisting of 346 and 340 amino acids in each monomer respectively were used in this study. The charges of E296 and D312 in OmpF and D299 and D315 in OmpC were set separately, whereas the rest ionisable residues were set as a common state at physiological pH. All possible protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315) were set in this study. These 4 different protonation states for both porins were: (i) fully charged E296(D299) and D312(315) (NP); (ii) protonated E296(D299) and charged D312(315) (P299); (iii) protonated D312(315) and charged E296(D299) (P315); (iv) protonated E296(D299) and D312(315) (P299–315). Overall, each porin was set into 4 simulations with different protonation states of E296(D299) and D312(315). Each system was embedded in a pre-equilibrated dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer (pre-equilibrated by running a 2ns simulation). The solvent-accessible molecular surface of both OmpC and OmpF were used as templates to remove lipids and perform short steered MD simulations of the solvated proteins as described in detail by Faraldo-Gomez et al. (Faraldo-Gomez et al., 2002). This generated a cavity into which proteins were inserted. Water and counter ions were then added into each system. Ions were added by replacing selected water molecules. For each system, a 0.2ns equilibration of protein restrained dynamics simulation was conducted with a force constant of 1000 kJmol−1nm−2, followed by a 10ns unrestrained MD production run.All simulations were performed using the GROMACS 4 simulation package (www.gromacs.org) (Lindahl et al., 2001) with an extended united atom version of the GROMOS96 forcefield (Bonvin et al., 2000). To relax steric conflicts generated during setup, all energy minimizations used up to 1000 steps of steepest descent. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993) with a short range cutoff of 1nm, a Fourier spacing of 0.12nm, and fourth-order spline interpolation. All simulations were performed in the constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT) ensemble. The temperature of the protein, DMPC, solvent, and ions were each coupled separately using the Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1984) at 300K with a coupling constant τt=0.1ps. The pressure was coupled using the Berendsen algorithm at 1bar with a coupling constant τp=1ps. The time step for integration was 2fs. Coordinates were saved every 2ps for subsequent analysis. To check the consistency of all simulations, 2 samples of OmpF and OmpC runs were extended to 25ns. No major change was observed.The results were analyzed by GROMACS and locally written code. Molecular graphic images were prepared using VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996). All results shown here are an average among all monomers.
