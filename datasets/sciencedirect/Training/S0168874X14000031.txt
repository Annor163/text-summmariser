Post-buckling analysis of composite plates under combined compression and shear loading using finite strip method

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Similar to the end shortening strain commonly used for compression, the skewed angle strain is uniquely proposed for the first time to control the in-plane shear action in the finite strip method.The post-buckling analysis of laminated composite plates under combined compression and in-plane shear action is controlled using the end shortening and skewed angle strains.When the ratio of skewed angle strain vs. end shortening strain is large enough, the average tensile section forces along the longitudinal direction are produced due to the large out-of-plane deflection.For the pure shear action, the resulting average longitudinal and transverse section forces cannot be ignored when compared to the average shear section force.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The post-buckling analysis of laminated plates under combined shear and compression is presented using the nonlinear finite strip method. Similar to the end shortening strain for compression, the skewed angle strain is uniquely proposed for in-plane shear action. The nonlinear governing equations under the skewed angle and end shortening are solved numerically using the Newton–Raphson method. The numerical finite element analysis is conducted to validate the proposed method, and a parametric study is performed to show the post-buckling behavior of composite plates. It is noted that the resulting average longitudinal and transverse section forces induced by the out-of-plane deflection or so called the non-linear strains cannot be ignored when compared to the average shear section force for the case of pure shear action. Also, when the out-of-plane deflection becomes large enough under combined compression and shear action, the average compression section force will transit to the average tensile section force in the longitudinal direction. The present analysis is capable of simulating the post-buckling behavior under the combined shear and compression action.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Composite materials have been widely used in civil aircrafts and aerospace vehicles because of their high specific strength and stiffness. The rectangular flat plate supported at its edges is one of the basic elements in composite structures. The structure is often subjected to a combination of in-plane loads, and it is noteworthy that most of the investigations appeared in the literature dealt with the post-buckling analysis of structures loaded only in in-plane compression. There are relatively few investigations about post-buckling of structures loaded in pure shear or combination of shear and compression. Stein [1,2] presented a Levy-type solution for the post-buckling analysis of long plates loaded in combined shear and compression. The ordinary nonlinear differential equations were derived to replace the nonlinear partial differential equations in plate theory. The method of analysis was based on the principle of virtual work in conjunction with the assumption that the deformations in the longitudinal direction are represented by a few important terms of a Fourier series. Zhang and Matthews [3,4] presented a nonlinear analysis of flat and curved panels of laminated composite materials under either compression or in-plane shear loading. In the analysis, a pair of governing equations in the von Karman sense is solved in conjunction with simply supported boundaries, and the governing equations were obtained using the virtual displacement and virtual force principles. They further studied the effect of shear direction on the post-buckling behavior of symmetric laminated composite plates and revealed that the post-buckling behavior of symmetric laminate was completely different when the applied shear directions was alternated for the plate under either shear or combined loading. Kosteletos [5] investigated the post-buckling response of flat rectangular laminates with clamped edges under in-plane shear load or under combined in-plane loading, and the nonlinear von Karman type governing equations in terms of lateral deflection and stress functions were solved by the Galerkin method. Mittelstedt et al. [6] evaluated the post-buckling behavior of rectangular orthotropic laminated composite plates with initial imperfections under in-plane shear loading by the variational method. Beerhorst et al. [7] studied the post-buckling behavior of an infinitely long symmetric laminates with elastically torsional springs along the longitudinal edges under compression and shear using the similar method [6]. Based on the finite element method, Noor and Peters [8] presented the post-buckling analysis of laminated anisotropic plates subjected to compression and shear using a reduced basic technique and a problem-adaptive computational algorithm. Singh and Kumar [9] studied the post-buckling behavior of rectangular laminates under the action of in-plane shear loads. Subsequently, they solved the same problem under the action of uniaxial compression combined with in-plane shear loads [10]. More recently, Singh and Kumar [11–14] investigated the nonlinear behavior of composite laminates with various shaped cutouts under in-plane shear or under combined action of uni-axial compression and in-plane shear loads. Gupta et al. [15] studied the post-buckling behavior of laminated plates considering the geometric nonlinearity and evolving material damage under uniaxial, biaxial compressive and in-plane shear loadings. Han and Lee [16] evaluated the post-buckling behavior of laminated composite plates under the combination of in-plane shear, compression and lateral loading using an element-based Lagragian formulation, in which the natural strains, stresses and constitutive equations are used in the shell element. Wang and Dawe [17] presented an example of post-buckling behavior of a square, 8-layer, symmetric laminate under the edge shear using the spline finite strip method.According to the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies available on the nonlinear analysis of laminate plates under shear loading or combination of shear and compression loading using the finite strip method (FSM). In this paper, the finite strip method is developed to solve the post-buckling problem of the laminated composite plates under a combination of shear (via the skewed angle strain) and compression (via end shortening strain) loading. The validity of the method is illustrated by comparing the predictions with the finite element analysis, followed by a parametric study.Consider a laminated composite plate with length of a and width of b (Fig. 1); the plate under a combination of in-plane shear and longitudinal compression loading can be regarded as a combination of the plate under the in-plane shear loading controlled by the skewed angle strain γ (Fig. 1a) and the plate under the longitudinal compression loading controlled by the end shortening strain ε (Fig. 1b), respectively. The transverse edges at y=0 and a hold straight when the plate loaded in the pure shear; while the transverse edges are prevented from expanding laterally when the plate only loaded in the longitudinal compression.The plate under shear loading via the skewed angle strain γ can be obtained by applying the edge shear displacements αb/2 and βa/2. When α=0 and β=γ, the plate is subjected to the edge shear displacements γa/2 only on the transverse edges; when α =γ and β=0, the plate is loaded with the edge shear displacements γb/2 on the longitudinal edges only; finally when α=γ/2 and β=γ/2, the plate is under the edge shear displacements γb/4 and γa/4 on the longitudinal and transverse edges, respectively.Consider a typical finite strip element based on the First Order Shear Deformation Plate Theory (FSDPT), the displacements of the middle surface of the plateu'(x,y),v'(x,y)andw'(x,y), and rotations of the normal to the middle surfaceϕx'(x,y)andϕy'(x,y)under combined compression and shear loading can be expressed as(1)u'(x,y)=uv'(x,y)=ε(a2−y)+γ(x−b2)+vw'(x,y)=wϕx'(x,y)=ϕxϕy'(x,y)=ϕyIn the finite strip analysis, the displacements u, v and w and the rotations ϕxand ϕyare expressed by the interpolation polynomial function in x-direction and smooth series functions in y-direction:(2)u=∑m=1rYum{Cu}{δ}mev=∑m=1rYvm{Cv}{δ}mew=∑m=1rYwm{Cw}{δ}meϕx=∑m=1rYϕxm{Cϕx}{δ}meϕy=∑m=1rYϕym{Cϕy}{δ}mewhere{δ}meis a vector representing the mth term nodal displacement parameters at the node lines of the finite strip element.

The finite element analysis is performed using the commercial software ABAQUS, and the shell element S4R is used. The deflection and average section forces are presented in the non-dimensional form as(26)w⁎=whavNxx⁎=avNxxb2E2h3avNyy⁎=avNyyb2E2h3avNxy⁎=avNxyb2E2h3where h is the total thickness, and b is the width of the laminate.A convergence study of the deflection at the central point and the average shear section force of post-buckled composite plates is presented to determine the number of equal length finite elements of FEM and the number of strips and approximate terms of FSM. The study is conducted for a given square laminate [45°/−45°]10 with the length of a=0.4m and the width of b=0.4 and subjected to the pure shear loading. The results of convergence in terms of deflection at the central point and the average shear section force with different number of strips and terms of FSM are given inTable 1. While the results of convergence with respect to the number of equal length finite elements of FEM are tabulated inTable 2. Based on the results shown in Tables 1 and 2, it is concluded that 10 LO3 strips for the whole plate and eight approximate terms of the series should be used in FSM; while 1600 equal length finite elements should be used in FEM which is equivalent to the element size of 0.01m. Thus, the similar strip and element size meshes for the following numerical example studies are adopted.First, the influence of fiber orientation on the post-buckling behavior of laminates under pure shear action is investigated. The applied skewed angle strain vs. central deflection of [θ/−θ]10 laminates with an increment of 15° for the fiber orientation θ (i.e., [15°/−15°]10, [30°/−30°]10 and [45°/−45°]10) is shown inFig. 3. The average shear section force avNxy⁎ vs. the central deflection curves for the laminates with different fiber orientation are shown inFig. 4. As expected, when the ply angle is near or equal to 45°, it results in the best plate rigidity against shear loading. The average section forces avNxx⁎ and avNyy⁎ vs. the central deflection are also shown inFigs. 5 and 6, respectively. The average longitudinal and transverse section forces induced by the skewed angle strain are in the comparative magnitude of the average shear section force (Fig. 4), and they cannot thus be neglected in the post-buckling range of the laminates under the pure shear action. From Figs. 5 and 6, they reveal that when the deflection at the central point w⁎ increases to a magnitude larger than 0.5, the average section forces avNxx⁎ and avNyy⁎ increase quickly, and this is caused by the large deflection or nonlinear normal strain induced by the skewed angle strain. They further demonstrate that the maximum value of the average section forces avNyy⁎ is larger than that of avNxx⁎, and this is because the transverse edges hold straight during the application of the skewed angle strain. Such an action produces a longitudinal tensile section force which prevents the shortening along the longitudinal direction.In order to investigate the influence of aspect ratio R=a/b on the post-buckling behavior of the [45°/−45°]10 laminates under pure shear action, the aspect ratios R=2.0, 1.5 and 1.0 are considered using the laminates with the length of a=0.8m, 0.6m or 0.4m and a fixed width of b=0.4m. The skewed angle vs. the central deflection under pure shear action is shown inFig. 7 for laminates with different aspect ratios. The relationship between the average section forces (avNxy⁎, avNxx⁎ and avNyy⁎) and the central point deflection of laminates of different aspect ratios is shown inFigs. 8–10, respectively. As expected, the laminate with a smaller aspect ratio exhibits a high resistance to shear loading. Again, the average longitudinal and transverse section forces (Figs. 9 and 10) induced by the skewed angle strain are in the comparative magnitude of the average shear section force (Fig. 8), and they cannot thus be neglected in the post-buckling analysis.The effect of the imperfection induced by the non-zero terms in the extension-bending coupling matrix [B] on the post-buckling behavior of square laminates (R=1.0 with a length of 0.6m and a total thickness of 5mm) is shown inFigs. 11–14. The magnitude of imperfection is prompted by the shear-bending coupling coefficients B16 and B26 with respect to the number of layers ([45°/−45°]2, [45°/−45°]4 and [45°/−45°]20) with the constant total thickness under pure shear action. The shear-bending coefficients B16 and B26 (imperfection) are not zeros for the antisymmetric laminates [45°/−45°]i(where i is the number of ±45° plies), and as the number of layers increases, the imperfection decreases. As expected, the laminates with a higher number of plies have a smaller shear-bending coupling effect and thus lead to better post-buckling resistance under pure shear action. The resulting average longitudinal and transverse section forces (Figs. 13 and 14) induced by the skewed angle strain are also comparable to the average shear section force (Fig. 12).The effect of loading ratio (LR) of shear vs. compression action (i.e., the skewed angle strain vs. end shortening strain, LR=γ/ε) on the post-buckling behavior of the rectangular laminates [45°/0°/90°/−45°]10 with the length of a=0.6m and the width of b=0.4m under combined compression (as controlled by the end shortening strain ε) and shear (as controlled by the skewed angle strain γ ) is shown inFigs. 15–19. From Fig. 17, it can observe that the average shear section forces avNxy⁎ are mostly caused by the skewed angle; while the average shear section force avNxy⁎ induced by the large deflection and extension-shear coupling can be neglected when compared with the average compression section force avNyy⁎ resulted in the longitudinal direction of the plate when the plate is primarily under uniaxial compression (Figs. 16 and 19).Because of the large deflection of the given laminate (i.e., an antisymmetric laminate [45°/0°/90°/−45°]10 in this example), the average tensile section force avNxx⁎ and avNyy⁎ will develop in both the longitudinal and transverse directions due to the applied in-plane shear and compression action. If the loading ratio LR=γ /ε is large enough (e.g., LR=8 or large, see Fig. 19), the average tensile section force in the longitudinal direction induced by the large deflection due to the skewed angle strain γ is larger than that by the average compressive section force due to the end shortening strain ε when the deflection of laminate reaches a certain value; and when the loading ratio is small enough (e.g., LR=0.5, 2 and 4, see Fig. 19), the average compressive section force in the longitudinal direction due to the end shortening strain ε plays a leading role. The compression caused by the end shortening in the longitudinal direction will introduce the compression force in both the longitudinal and transverse directions when the plate is primarily subjected to the end shortening strain (i.e., with a lower LR value). Due to the out-of-plane deflection or nonlinear effect, both the average longitudinal and transverse tensile section forces are resulted when under the pure in-plane shear action. Thus, the transitions from compression to tension of both the average transverse and longitudinal section forces are observed in Figs. 18 and 19 when the loading ratio LR increases. As the loading ratio LR increases to a certain magnitude, the average in-plane shear section force will dominate the post-buckling behavior (see Fig. 17); while similarly, the end shortening will play a more dominant role when the loading ratio LR decreases (see Fig. 19).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, the post-buckling analysis of laminated composite plates under pure in-plane shear or combined compression and in-plane shear action is conducted using the finite strip method (FSM), and the in-plane shear and longitudinal compression loading are controlled by the skewed angle and end shortening strains, respectively. All the nonlinear analysis by FSM is validated with the numerical finite element analysis, and their close correlations indicate that the presented method is capable of capturing the post-bucking behavior of laminates under combined in-plane shear and compression action. It is noted that the resulting average longitudinal and transverse section forces which are induced by the out-of-plane deflection or so called non-linear strains cannot be ignored when compared to the average shear section force for the case of pure shear action. For the combined shear and compression action, when both the ratio of skewed angle strain vs. end shortening strain and the out-of-plane deflection are large enough, the average tensile section forces along the longitudinal direction will produce due to the large out-of-plane deflection; when the out-of-plane deflection becomes large enough, the average compression section force will transit to the average tensile section force in the transverse direction. In summary, similar to the end shortening strain for compression action, the skewed angle strain is uniquely proposed to control the in-plane shear action, and the present finite strip method is able to conduct the nonlinear analysis of laminated composite plates under combined shear and compression action and better facilitate the design analysis and optimization of laminates against post-buckling.(1)The quadratic part of strain energy and constant part of stiffness matrix:The quadratic part of strain energyΠ3e:(A.1)Π3e=∫12{εL}T[A]{εL}dxdy=∑m=1r∑n=1r{δ}me[Kip]mne{δ}newhere[Kip]mne=[Rip]mne+[Rip]mneTand[Rip]mne=∫(12A11{Cu},xTYumYun{Cu},x+12A22{Cv}TYv,ymYv,yn{Cv}+A12{Cu},xTYumYv,yn{Cv}+A66{Cu}TYu,ymYvn{Cv},x+12A66({Cu}TYu,ymYu,yn{Cu}+{Cv},yTYvmYvn{Cv},x)+A16({Cu}xTYumYu,yn{Cu}+{Cu},xTYumYvn{Cv},x)+A26({Cv}TYv,ymYu,yn{Cu}+{Cv}TYv,ymYvn{Cv},x))dxdy.The quadratic part of strain energyΠ4e:(A.2)Π4e=∫{κ}T[B]{εL}dxdy=∑m=1r∑n=1r{δ}me[Kio]mne{δ}newhere[Kio]mne=[Rio]mne+[Rio]mneTand[Rio]mne=∫(B11{Cu},xTYumYϕxn{Cϕx},x+B22{Cv}TYv,ymYϕy,yn{Cϕy}+B12({Cv}TYv,ymYϕxn{Cϕx},x+{Cu},xTYumYϕy,yn{Cϕy})+B66({Cu}TYu,ymYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cu}TYu,ymYϕyn{Cϕy},x)+B66({Cv},xTYvmYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cv},xTYvmYϕyn{Cϕy},x)+B16({Cu}TYu,ymYϕxn{Cϕx},x+{Cv},xTYvmYϕxn{Cϕx},x)+B16({Cu},xTYumYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cu},xTYumYϕyn{Cϕy},x)+B26({Cu}TYu,ymYϕy,yn{Cϕy}+{Cv},xTYvmYϕy,yn{Cϕy})+B26({Cv}TYv,ymYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cv}TYv,ymYϕyn{Cϕy},x))dxdy.The quadratic part of strain energyΠ5e:(A.3)Π5e=∫12{κ}T[D]{κ}dxdy=∑m=1r∑n=1r{δ}me[Kop]mne{δ}newhere[Kop]mne=[Rop]mne+[Rop]mneTand[Rop]mne=∫(12D11{Cϕx},xTYϕxmYϕxn{Cϕx},x+12D22{Cϕy}TYϕy,ymYϕy,yn{Cϕy}+D12{Cϕx},xTYϕxmYϕy,yn{Cϕy}+D66{Cϕx}TYϕx,ymYϕyn{Cϕy},x+12D66({Cϕx}TYϕx,ymYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cϕy},xTYϕymYϕyn{Cϕy},x)+D16({Cϕx},xTYϕxmYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cϕx},xTYϕxmYϕyn{Cϕy},x)+D26({Cϕy}TYϕy,ymYϕx,yn{Cϕx}+{Cϕy}TYϕy,ymYϕyn{Cϕy},x))dxdy.The quadratic part of strain energyΠ7e:(A.4)Π7e=∫12{γ}T[H]{γ}dxdy=∑m=1r∑n=1r{δ}me[Kts]mne{δ}newhere[Kts]mne=[Rts]mne+[Rts]mneTand[Rts]mne=∫(12H11({Cw},xTYwmYwn{Cw},x+{Cϕx}TYϕxmYϕxn{Cϕx})+H11{Cw},xTYwmYϕxn{Cϕx}+H22{Cw}TYw,ymYϕyn{Cϕy}+H12({Cw},xTYwmYw,yn{Cw}+{Cϕx}TYϕxmYϕyn{Cϕy})+H12({Cw},xTYwmYϕyn{Cϕy}+{Cw}TYw,ymYϕxn{Cϕx})+12H22({Cw}TYw,ymYw,yn{Cw}+{Cϕy}TYϕymYϕyn{Cϕy}))dxdy.The cubic part of strain energy and linear part of stiffness matrix:(A.5)∂{d}T[V]{d}T[M]{d}∂{d}=∂diVidjMjkdk∂di=(ViMjk+VjMik+VkMji)dkdj=12[K1]dj=12[K1]{d}where[K1]=(ViMjk+ViMkj+VjMik+VkMij+VkMji+VjMki)dk;[M]=[M]T, that is to sayMnm=Mmn.The cubic part of strain energyΠ8e:(A.6)Π8e=∫{εL}T[A]{εNL}dxdy=∑l=1r∑m=1r∑n=1r(Π8e)lmnwhere(Π8e)lmn=∫(12A11{δ}leT{Cu},xTYul{δ}meT{Cw},xTYwmYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+12A22{δ}leT{Cv}TYv,yl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYw,yn{Cw}{δ}ne+12A12{δ}leT{Cv}TYv,yldT{Cw},xTYwmYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+12A12{δ}leT{Cu},xTYul{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYw,yn{Cw}{δ}ne+A66{δ}leT{Cu}TYu,yl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+A66{δ}leT{Cv},xTYvl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+12A16{δ}leT{Cu}TYu,yl{δ}meT{Cw},xTYwmYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+12A16{δ}leT{Cv},xTYvl{δ}meT{Cw},xTYwmYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+A16{δ}leT{Cu},xTYul{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+A26{δ}leT{Cv}TYv,yl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYwn{Cw},x{δ}ne+12A26{δ}leT{Cu}TYu,yl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYw,yn{Cw}{δ}ne+12A26{δ}leT{Cv},xTYvl{δ}meT{Cw}TYw,ymYw,yn{Cw}{δ}ne)dxdyBased on Eq.
