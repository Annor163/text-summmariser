In this paper, we investigate the technique for clustering analysis under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. We first develop an intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator and extend the Lukasiewicz implication operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment, and then we define an intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product and an intuitionistic fuzzy square product. Furthermore, we apply the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product to compare the alternatives in multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information, and use the intuitionistic fuzzy square product to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix, based on which we develop a direct method for intuitionistic fuzzy clustering analysis. Some numerical examples are also given to illustrate and verify our results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Clustering analysis is a common tool used to handle and analyze fuzzy and uncertainty information. It has been receiving great attention from researchers recently on how to cluster intuitionistic fuzzy information. So far, the clustering analysis methods have been mainly based on various cutting matrices or kinds of intuitionistic fuzzy equivalent matrices [1–6]. These methods have a common characteristic that they need to get an equivalent matrix before they get the desired cutting matrix which is used to do clustering analysis. But transforming the matrix that shows the relations among alternatives into an intuitionistic fuzzy equivalent matrix and getting its corresponding λ-cutting matrices costs lots of computation and time [1]. Considering that the relations among alternatives are the basis to do clustering analysis, how to express the relations among alternatives is an important research topic. Some methods to show the relations among alternatives have been developed [1–4,6]. Zhang et al. [1] gave the definition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity degree, based on which they constructed an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix. Xu et al. [2] used the association matrix to show the alternatives’ relations. Cai et al. [4] employed the intuitionistic fuzzy dissimilarity matrix to present the relations among alternatives. Wang et al. [7] presented a netting method to make clustering analysis of intuitionistic fuzzy sets via intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix. Zhao et al. [6] developed a clustering algorithm, which utilizes the association coefficient of intuitionistic fuzzy sets to construct an association matrix, then calculates the λ-cutting matrix of the association matrix no matter whether it is an equivalent matrix or not, and finally, the λ-cutting matrix is used to cluster intuitionistic fuzzy sets.As we know, a straightforward tool to reflect the relations among alternatives is intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix, so can we use it to do clustering analysis directly? If so, we can save lots of computation and time, but it relies on the clustering analysis technique. In order to solve this issue, in this paper, we shall give the definition of intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator which is evolved from “0–1” classical implication and fuzzy implication and then use the intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product and an intuitionistic fuzzy square product. The intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product can be used to compare the alternatives in multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information, and the intuitionistic fuzzy square product is used to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix. Moreover, we use the intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix to develop a direct clustering analysis method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment which can get the classes from it directly, and demonstrate our results with some numerical examples.Definition 1[8]Let a set X be fixed, then an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) A on X is defined asA={x,μA(x),νA(x)|x∈X}, whereμA:X→[0,1],x∈X→μA(x)∈[0,1]andνA:X→[0,1],x∈X→νA(x)∈[0,1]denote a membership function and a non-membership function respectively. Furthermore, μA(x)+νA(x)≤1, for any x∈X, and πA(x)=1−μA(x)−νA(x) is called an uncertainty (or hesitation) function of x to A.Especially, if πA(x)=0, then A reduces to a fuzzy set. For convenience, Xu and Yager [9] called α=(μα, να) an intuitionistic fuzzy value (IFV), where μα∈[0, 1], να∈[0, 1], and μα+να≤1.Based on IFVs, we introduce some basic concepts as below:Definition 2[1]LetZ=(zij)m×nbe a m×n matrix, if all zij(i=1, 2, ..., m;j=1, 2, ..., n) are IFVs, then Z is called an intuitionistic fuzzy matrix.LetZ=(zij)n×nbe an n×n intuitionistic fuzzy matrix, where zij=(μij, νij) (j=1, 2, ..., n), if(Reflexivity): zii=(1, 0), for all i=1, 2, ..., n;(Symmetry): zij=zji, i.e., μij=μji, νij=νji, for all i, j=1, 2, ..., n,Letα1=(μα1,να1)andα2=(μα2,να2)be two IFVs,s(α1)=μα1−να1ands(α2)=μα2−να2be the scores of α1 and α2 respectively, andh(α1)=μα1+να1andh(α2)=μα2+να2be the accuracy degrees of α1 and α2 respectively, thenif s(α1)<s(α2), then α2 is smaller than α2, denoted by α1<α2;if s(α1)=s(α2), thenif h(α1)=h(α2), then α1 and α2 represent the same information, i.e.,μα1=μα2andνα1=να2, denoted by α1=α2;if h(α1)<h(α2), then α1 is smaller than α2, denoted by α1<α2;if h(α1)>h(α2), then α1 is smaller than α2, denoted by α1>α2.Let X and Y be two non-empty sets, thenR={(x,y),μR(x,y),νR(x,y)|x∈X,y∈Y}.is called an intuitionistic fuzzy relation, whereμR:X×Y→[0,1],νR:X×Y→[0,1].and0≤μR(x,y)+νR(x,y)≤1,forany(x,y)∈X×YLet R be an intuitionistic fuzzy relation, if(Reflexivity): μR(x,x)=1, νR(x,x)=0, for any x∈X;(Symmetry): μR(x,y)=μR(y,x), νR(x,y)=νR(y,x), for any (x, y)∈X×Y, then R is called an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity relation.Let U and V be two ordinary subsets, and L⊂U×V be an ordinary relation. Then for any a,b∈V, Lb={a|aLb} and aL={b|aLb} are respectively called a former set and a latter set.Let U, V and W be ordinary subsets, L⊂U×V and S⊂V×W, then a triangle product L⊲S⊂U×W of L and S can be defined as:aL⊲Sc⇔aL⊂Sc,forany(a,c)∈U×WSimilarly, a square product L□S is defined as:aL□Sc⇔aL=Sc,forany(a,c)∈U×Wwhere aL=Sc if and only if aL⊂Sc and aL⊃Sc.Wang and Liu [15] introduced a fuzzy implication operator as follows:Definition 9[15]Let I be a binary operation on [0,1], ifI(0,0)=I(0,1)=I(1,1)=1andI(1,0)=0then I is called a fuzzy implication operator.For any a, b∈[0, 1], I(a,b) is a fuzzy implication operator, which can also be denoted as a→b. Especially, the well-known Lukasiewicz implication operator is given as φ(a, b)=min(1−a+b, 1), which means that the result of “a imply b” is min(1−a+b, 1).Motivated by the idea of Definition 9, in what follows, we define the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator.Definition 10Let Θ be the set of all IFVs, and I be a binary operation on Θ, ifI((0,1),(0,1))=I((0,1),(1,0))=I((1,0),(1,0))=(1,0)andI((1,0),(0,1))=(0,1)then I is called an intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator.Now we extend Lukasiewicz implication operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment. For any two IFVs α=(μα, να) and β=(μβ, νβ), if we only consider the membership degrees μαand μβof α and β, then min{1−μα+μβ, 1} cannot reflect the superiority of IFVs, so we should consider the non-memberships vα and vβ as well. Then based on the components of IFVs and the form of Lukasiewicz implication operator, we can define an intuitionistic fuzzy Lukasiewicz implication operator φ(α, β), whose membership degree and non-membership degree are expressed asmin{1,min{1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}}=min{1,1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}andmax{0,min{1−(1−μα+μβ),1−(1−νβ+να)}}=max{0,min{μα−μβ,νβ−να}}respectively, i.e.,(1)φ(α,β)=min{1,1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να},max{0,min{μα−μβ,νβ−να}}Clearly, we need to prove that the value of φ(α, β) should satisfy all the conditions of an IFV. In fact, from (1), we havemin{1,1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}≥0,max{0,min{μα−μβ,νβ−να}}≥0and sincemax{0,min{μα−μβ,νβ−να}}=1−min{1,max{1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}}min{1,max{1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}}≥min{1,1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}then1−min{1,max{1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}}+min{1,1−μα+μβ,1−νβ+να}≤1which indicates that the value of φ(α, β) derived by (1) is an IFV.In practical applications, (1) can be realized by the MATLAB code as follows:Example 1Let α=(0, 1) and β=(1, 0), then by (1), we haveφ(α,α)=min{1,1−0+0,1−1+1},max{0,min{0−0,1−1}}=(1,0)φ(β,β)=min{1,1−1+1,1−0+0},max{0,min{1−1,0−0}}=(1,0)φ(α,β)=min{1,1−0+1,1−0+1},max{0,min{0−1,0−1}}=(1,0)φ(β,α)=min{1,1−1+0,1−1+0},max{0,min{1−0,1−0}}=(0,1)With the intuitionistic fuzzy Lukasiewicz implication, the traditional triangle product and square product [13], below we further define an intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product and an intuitionistic fuzzy square product:Definition 11Let α={α1, α2, ..., αl}, γ={γ1, γ2, ..., γm} and β={β1, β2, ..., βn} be three sets of IFVs, R∈F(α×γ) and S∈F(γ×β) be two intuitionistic fuzzy relations, then an intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product R⊲S∈F(α×β) of R and S can be defined as:Similarly, we define an intuitionistic fuzzy square product R□S∈F(α×β) of R and S as:(3)(R□S)(αi,βj)=min1≤k≤mμmin(R(αi,γk)→S(γk,βj),S(γk,βj)→R(αi,γk)),νmin(R(αi,γk)→S(γk,βj),S(γk,βj)→R(αi,γk))forany(αi,βj)∈(α,β),i=1,2,⋯,l;j=1,2,⋯,nFor convenience, we denote Rikas R(αi, γk) for short, and the same with others. As a result, (2) and (3) can be respectively simplified as:(R⊲S)(αi,βj)=1m∑j=1mμRik→Skj,1m∑j=1mνRik→Skj(R□S)(αi,βj)=min1≤k≤mμmin(Rik→Skj,Skj→Rik),νmin(Rik→Skj,Skj→Rik)Indeed, the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product and the intuitionistic fuzzy square product are very closely-related with each other. That is, the former is the basis of the latter, due to that (R□S)(αi, βj) is directly derived from (R⊲S)(αi, βj) and (S⊲R)(αi, βj).In this section, we shall apply the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product to compare any two alternatives in multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information, and then use the intuitionistic fuzzy square product to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix which is used as a basis for further investigating intuitionistic fuzzy clustering technique.Consider a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem, let Y={Y1, Y2, ..., Yn} be a set of alternatives, and G={G1, G2, ..., Gm} be a set of attributes. The characteristic (or called attribute value) of each alternative Yi under all the attributes Gj(j=1, 2, ..., m) is represented as an IFS:(4)Yi={Gj,μYi(Gj),νYi(Gj)|Gj∈G},i=1,2,...,n;j=1,2,...,mwhereμYi(Gj)denotes the membership degree of Yito GjandvYi(Gj)denotes the non-membership degree of Yito Gj. Obviously,πYi(Gj)=1−μYi(Gj)−νYi(Gj)is the uncertainty (or hesitation) degree of Yito Gj. If letzij=(μij,νij)=(μYi(Gj),νYi(Gj)), which is an IFV, then based on these IFVs zij(i=1, 2, ..., n;j=1, 2, ..., m), we can construct an n×m intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixZ=(zij)n×m.For the above problem, the characteristic vectors of any two alternatives Yiand Yjare expressed as Zi=(zi1, zi2, …, zim) and Zj=(zj1, zj2, …, zjm) respectively. The implication degree of the alternatives Yiand Yjcan be calculated with the following intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product:(5)(Zi⊲Zj−1)ij=1m∑k=1mμZik→Zjk,1m∑k=1mνZik→Zjkwhich shows the degree that how much the alternative Yjis preferred to the alternative Yi, whereZj−1denotes the inverse of Zj, which is defined as(Zj−1)kj=(Zj)jk=zjk,μZik→ZjkandνZik→Zjkare respectively as shown in (1) for any k.Similarly, we can calculate(6)(Zj⊲Zi−1)ji=1m∑k=1mμZjk→Zik,1m∑k=1mνZjk→Zikwhich shows the degree that how much the alternative Yiis preferred to the alternative Yj.From (5), (6) and Definition 4, we can get an order of the alternatives Yiand Yj. Concretely speaking, (1) if(Zi⊲Zj−1)ij>(Zj⊲Zi−1)ji, then the alternative Yjis preferred to the alternative Yi; (2) if(Zi⊲Zj−1)ij=(Zj⊲Zi−1)ji, then there is no difference between the alternatives Yiand Yj; and (3) if(Zi⊲Zj−1)ij<(Zj⊲Zi−1)ji, then the alternative Yiis preferred to the alternative Yj.Example 2An auto market wants to classify five different cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) into several types [1]. Each car has six evaluation factors: (1) G1-oil consumption; (2) G2-coefficient of friction; (3) G3-price; (4) G4-comfortable degree; (5) G5-design; and (6) G6-safety coefficient. The evaluation results of each car with respect to the factors Gj(j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are represented by the IFSs, shown as in Table 1.We first express the evaluation results of the cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in Table 1as the vectors Zi=(zi1, zi2, ⋯, zi6)(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) respectively, where zij=(μij, νij)(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5;j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):Z1=((0.3,0.5),(0.6,0.1),(0.4,0.3),(0.8,0.1),(0.1,0.6),(0.5,0.4))Z2=((0.5,0.3),(0.5,0.2),(0.6,0.1),(0.7,0.1),(0.3,0.6),(0.4,0.3))Z3=((0.4,0.4),(0.8,0.1),(0.5,0.1),(0.6,0.2),(0.4,0.5),(0.3,0.2))Z4=((0.2,0.4),(0.4,0.1),(0.9,0.0),(0.8,0.1),(0.2.0.5),(0.7,0.1))Z5=((0.5,0.2),(0.3,0.6),(0.6.0.3),(0.7,0.1),(0.6,0.2),(0.5,0.3))Then we utilize the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle products (5) and (6) to calculate the implication degrees(Zi⊲Zj−1)ijand(Zj⊲Zi−1)ji(i=1,2,3,4,5;j=1,2,...,6)respectively:(Z1⊲Z2−1)12=16∑k=16μZ1k→Z2k,16∑k=16νZ1k→Z2k=16∑k=16min{1,1−μ1k+μ2k,1−ν2k+ν1k},16∑k=16max{0,min{μ1k−μ2k,ν2k−ν1k}}=(0.9500,0.0167)(Z2⊲Z1−1)21=16∑k=16μZ2k→Z1k,16∑k=16νZ2k→Z1k=16∑k=16min{1,1−μ2k+μ1k,1−ν1k+ν2k},16∑k=16max{0,min{μ2k−μ1k,ν1k−ν2k}}=(0.8833,0.0667)Similarly, we have(Z1⊲Z3−1)13=(0.9333,0.0167),(Z3⊲Z1−1)31=(0.8333,0.0500)(Z1⊲Z4−1)14=(0.9500,0.000),(Z4⊲Z1−1)41=(0.8333,0.1000)(Z1⊲Z5−1)15=(0.9000,0.0500),(Z5⊲Z1−1)51=(0.8167,0.1000)(Z2⊲Z3−1)23=(0.9333,0.0333),(Z3⊲Z2−1)32=(0.9167,0.0333)(Z2⊲Z4−1)24=(0.9167,0.0167),(Z4⊲Z2−1)42=(0.8833,0.0500)(Z2⊲Z5−1)25=(0.9000,0.0333),(Z5⊲Z2−1)52=(0.9000,0.0500)(Z3⊲Z4−1)34=(0.8667,0.0000),(Z4⊲Z3−1)43=(0.8333,0.0500)(Z3⊲Z5−1)35=(0.8667,0.0833),(Z5⊲Z3−1)53=(0.8500,0.0667)(Z4⊲Z5−1)45=(0.8167,0.1000),(Z5⊲Z4−1)54=(0.8833,0.0833)According to Definition 4, we know that(Z1⊲Z2−1)12>(Z2⊲Z1−1)21,(Z1⊲Z3−1)13>(Z3⊲Z1−1)31,(Z1⊲Z4−1)14>(Z4⊲Z1−1)41(Z1⊲Z5−1)15>(Z5⊲Z1−1)51,(Z2⊲Z3−1)23>(Z3⊲Z2−1)32,(Z2⊲Z4−1)24>(Z4⊲Z2−1)42(Z2⊲Z5−1)25>(Z5⊲Z2−1)52,(Z3⊲Z4−1)34>(Z4⊲Z3−1)43,(Z3⊲Z5−1)35>(Z5⊲Z3−1)53(Z4⊲Z5−1)45<(Z5⊲Z4−1)54from which we get Y4≻Y5≻Y3≻Y2≻Y1.For convenience, we can calculate (5) or (6) with the following MATLAB code:From the above process, we can see that the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product can be used to compare the alternatives in multiple attribute decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information, but the computational complexity increases rapidly as the numbers of the alternatives and attributes increase.From (3), we know that the intuitionistic fuzzy square product (R□S)ijcan be interpreted as: it measures the similarity degree of the ith row of an intuitionistic fuzzy matrix R and the jth row of an intuitionistic fuzzy matrix S mathematically. Therefore, considering the problem stated at the beginning of Section 4,(Zi□Zj−1)ijreflects the similarity of the alternatives Yiand Yj. We can use the following formula to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix for the alternatives Yi(i=1, 2, ..., n):(7)sim(Yi,Yj)=(Zi□Zj−1)ij=min1≤k≤mμmin(Zik→Zjk,Zjk→Zik),νmin(Zik→Zjk,Zjk→Zik)(7) has the following desirable properties:(1)sim(Yi, Yj) is an IFV;sim(Yi, Yi)=(1, 0)(i=1, 2, ⋯, n);sim(Yi, Yj)=sim(Yj, Yi)(i, j=1, 2, ⋯, n).(1)Let us prove that sim(Yi, Yj) is an IFV:Since the results ofZik→ZjkandZjk→Zikare all IFVs as proved previously, thenμmin(Zik→Zjk,Zjk→Zik),νmin(Zik→Zjk,Zjk→Zik)is an IFV, for any k.(2)SinceSinceFrom the analysis above, we can know that (7) satisfies the conditions of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity relation, and thus, we can use it to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix.After we have gotten an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix Z, with this method, there is no need to seek for its equivalent matrix before doing clustering analysis. Starting with intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix, we may get the wanted clustering analysis results as with intuitionistic fuzzy equivalent matrix, which has been proven strictly [16]. Luo [16] introduced a direct method for clustering fuzzy sets which can only consider the membership degrees of fuzzy sets. In this section, we shall introduce a direct intuitionistic fuzzy clustering analysis method, which can take into account both the membership degrees and the non-membership degrees of IFVs under intuitionistic fuzzy environments. The method involves the following steps:Step 1. LetZ=(zij)n×nbe an intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix, where zij=(μij, νij) (i,j=1,2,…,n) are IFVs, then we select one of the elements of Z to determine the confidence level λ1, which obeys the following principles:(1)Rank the membership degrees of zij(i, j=1, 2, ..., n) in descending order, and then takeλ1=(μλ1,νλ1)=(μi1j1,νi1j1), whereμi1j1=maxi,j{μij}.If there exist two IFVs(μi1j1,νi1j1)and(μi1j1,ν¯i1j1)in 1), such thatνi1j1≠ν¯i1j1(without loss of generality, letνi1j1<ν¯i1j1), then we choose the first one as λ1, i.e.,λ1=(μi1j1,νi1j1).Then, for each alternative Yi, we let(8)[Yi]Z(1)={Yj|zij=λ1}In this case, Yiand all of the alternatives in[Yi]Z(1)are clustered into one class, and each of the other alternatives is clustered into one class.Step 2. Choose the confidence level λ2 such thatλ2=(μλ2,νλ2)=(μi2j2,νi2j2), withμi2j2=max(i,j)≠(i1,j1){μij}(in particular, if there exist two or more IFVs whose membership degrees have the same valueμi2j2, then we can follow the policy in 2) of Step 1). Then, we let[Yi]Z(2)={Yj|zij=λ2}, in this case, Yiand all of alternatives in[Yi]Z(2)are clustered into one class, and each of the other alternatives is clustered into one class. Merging[Yi]Z(1)and[Yi]Z(2), we get[Yi]Z(1,2)={Yj|zij∈{λ1,λ2}}, and thus, Yiand all of the alternatives in[Yi]Z(1,2)are clustered into one class, and the classes of the other alternatives keep unchanged.Step 3. Take the other confidence levels and do clustering analysis following the procedure of Step 2 until all the alternatives are clustered into one class.From the above processes, we can see that our direct method can realize the clustering analysis just based on the subscripts of alternatives, and there is even no need to get the λ-cutting matrix, which is a notable advantage of our method. In practical applications, after choosing some proper confidence levels, we just need to confirm their locations in the intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix, and then we can get the classes of the considered objects on the basis of their location subscripts.Example 3We use the same example as Example 2, and utilize the direct intuitionistic fuzzy method developed above to classify the five cars, which involves the following steps:Step 1. By (7), we calculatesim(Y1,Y2)=(Z1□Z2−1)12=min1≤k≤6μmin(Z1k→Z2k,Z2k→Z1k),νmin(Z1k→Z2k,Z2k→Z1k).For convenience, we can realize this process with the following MATLAB code:With this code, we only need to change the values of m and n to get the result of sim(Yi, Yi). Thus, we havesim(Y1,Y2)=0.7,0.2.Then we calculate the others in a similar way. Consequently, we get the intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix:Z=(1,0)(0.7,0.2)(0.7,0.1)(0.5,0.3)(0.5,0.4)(0.7,0.2)(1,0)(0.7,0.1)(0.6,0.1)(0.6,0.3)(0.7,0.1)(0.7,0.1)(1,0)(0.6,0.1)(0.5,0.5)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.1)(0.6,0.1)(1,0)(0.6,0.3)(0.5,0.4)(0.6,0.3)(0.5,0.5)(0.6,0.3)(1,0)Step 2. Choose the confidence levels properly, and get the corresponding clustering results with the direct intuitionistic fuzzy clustering method:(1)When0.7<μλ1≤1.0, by (8), we know that there is no value Zijin Z such that zij=λ1, i.e.,[Yi]Z(1)=ϕ. Thus, each car is clustered into one class: {Y1}, {Y2}, {Y3}, {Y4} and {Y5}.When0.6<μλ2≤0.7, we have the following two cases:z13=z23=(0.7, 0.1): In this case, by (8), we know that Y1,Y2 and Y3 can be clustered into one class: {Y1, Y2, Y3}. Then, by Step 2 of the clustering method, we get that the cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are clustered into three classes: {Y1, Y2, Y3}, {Y4} and {Y5}.z12=(0.7, 0.2): In this case, Y1 and Y2 can be clustered into one class. Thus, by Step 2 of the clustering method, we know that the cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are also clustered into three classes: {Y1, Y2, Y3}, {Y4} and {Y5}.When0.5<μλ3≤0.6, we have the following two cases:z24=z34=(0.6, 0.1): In this case, Y2, Y3 and Y4 can be clustered into one class. Then, merging the clustering results of (1) and (2), we can see that the cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are clustered into two classes: {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4} and {Y5}.z25=(0.6, 0.3): In this case, Y2 and Y5 can be clustered into one class. Then, merging the clustering results above, it can be obtained that the cars Yi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are clustered into one class: {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5}.Compared with Zhang et al. [1]’s method, we can know that the direct intuitionistic fuzzy method with less calculation amount can have better clustering results.In this paper, we have defined some new concepts, including the intuitionistic fuzzy implication operator, intuitionistic fuzzy Lukasiewicz implication operator, intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product, and intuitionistic fuzzy square product, etc. We have applied the intuitionistic fuzzy triangle product and the intuitionistic fuzzy square product to develop a direct method for intuitionistic fuzzy clustering analysis. Using this method, we can cluster the alternatives with intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix instead of intuitionistic fuzzy equivalent matrix. With some numerical examples, we have found that the direct intuitionistic fuzzy clustering analysis method not only needs less calculation efforts, but also has desirable clustering results.
