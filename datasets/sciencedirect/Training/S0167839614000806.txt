In this paper two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions, tensor product S-λ basis functions and triangular S-λ basis functions, are constructed by means of the technique of generating functions and transformation factors. These two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions have lots of important properties, such as non-negativity, partition of unity, linear independence and so on. The framework of the tensor product S-λ basis functions provides a unified scheme for dealing with several kinds of tensor product basis functions, such as the tensor product Bernstein basis functions, the tensor product Poisson basis functions and some other new tensor product basis functions. The framework of the triangular S-λ surface basis functions includes the triangular Bernstein basis functions, the rational triangular Bernstein basis functions and some other new triangular basis functions. Moreover, the corresponding two kinds of S-λ surfaces are constructed by means of these two kinds of bivariate basis functions, respectively. These two kinds of S-λ surface patches have the important properties of surface modeling, such as affine invariance, convex hull property and so on.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many basis functions used in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) are closely associated with probability distributions, particularly the discrete distributions (Johnson et al., 2005). Several related works on this subject have been done (Dahmen and Micchelli, 1986; Fan and Zeng, 2012; Goldman, 1988, 1999; Goldman and Morin, 2000; Mainar and Peña, 2007; Zeng and Cheng, 2001). In 2012, Fan and Zeng presented a method of curve modeling based on a broad class of discrete distributions which are called S-λ distributions (Fan and Zeng, 2012). The aim of this paper is to extend the work of Fan and Zeng (2012) to surface modeling.In this paper two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions, tensor product S-λ basis functions and triangular S-λ basis functions, are constructed by means of the technique of generating functions and transformation factors. Some important properties of these two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions, such as non-negativity, partition of unity, linear independence and so on, are obtained. Moreover, the corresponding tensor product S-λ surface patches and triangular S-λ surface patches are constructed by means of these two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions, respectively. These properties of these two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions guarantee that the corresponding S-λ surface patches have the important properties of surface modeling, such as affine invariable, convex hull and others.The framework of the tensor product S-λ basis functions provides a unified scheme for dealing with several kinds of tensor product basis functions, such as the tensor product Bernstein basis functions, the tensor product Poisson basis functions and some other new tensor product basis functions. Similarly, the framework of the triangular S-λ basis functions includes the triangular Bernstein basis functions, the rational triangular Bernstein basis functions and some other new triangular basis functions.In the special case, when the number of these two kinds of bivariate S-λ basis functions is infinity, we represent the corresponding S-λ surface patch with a finite sequence of control points by repeating the control points. We also show that, as in the case of S-λ curves, the S-λ surface patches can be modified by changing the coefficients of generating functions. This modification technique does not require adjustments of control points and parameters.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the definitions and some important properties of univariate S-λ basis functions and S-λ curves are recalled. In Section 3, the definitions of tensor product S-λ basis functions and tensor product S-λ surface patch are introduced. Some important properties of the tensor product basis functions and the tensor product surface patches are studied. In Section 4, the definitions of triangular S-λ basis functions and triangular S-λ surface patch are introduced. Some important properties of the triangular basis functions and the triangular surface patches are studied. In Section 5, two examples of the tensor product S-λ surface patches and the triangular S-λ surface patches are shown.We first recall the definitions of univariate S-λ basis functions and S-λ curves which were introduced in Fan and Zeng (2012). Let{Aj}j=0lbe a given sequence of positive numbers, where l may be ∞.S(t)=∑j=0lAjtjis the corresponding generating function with radius of convergence R. Letλ(s)be a transformation factor mapping[0,R1)onto[0,R), whereR1and R may be ∞.Definition 2.1Let ξ be an integer valued random variable satisfyingP(ξ=j)=P1,j(s)=Aj[λ(s)]jS(λ(s))(j=0,1,2,…,l).{Aj(n)}j=0nlis n-convolution of{Aj}j=0l. Its generating function is(1)Sn(s)=[S(s)]n=∑j=0nlAj(n)sj,s∈[0,R).And let{ξi}i=1∞be a sequence of independent random variables with the same distribution as ξ. Setηn=∑i=1nξi. Then by convolution formula of probability, we have(2)P(ηn=j)=Aj(n)[λ(s)]jSn(λ(s)),j=0,1,2,…,nl,s∈[0,R1).Random variablesηnpossess the probability distributions (2), which are called S-λ distributions. Let(3)Pn,j(s)=Aj(n)[λ(s)]jSn(λ(s))s∈[0,R1),j=0,1,2,…,nl.It is obvious thatPn,j(s)≥0and∑j=0nlPn,j(s)=1.Pn,j(s)are called S-λ basis functions.The univariate S-λ basis functions have lots of properties as those of the Bernstein basis functions (cf. Fan and Zeng, 2012), such as non-negativity, partition of unity, interpolation, unimodality, linear independence, Descartes's law of signs, degree elevation, degree reduction, convolution and so on.Definition 2.2Let{Vj}j=0nlbe a collection of control points,Vj∈R3, then an S-λ curveC(t)is defined by(4)C(t)=∑j=0nlPn,j(t)Vj,t∈[0,R1).The S-λ curves have many important properties, such as affine invariance, convex hull, interpolation, locality, non-degeneration and variation diminishing (cf. Fan and Zeng, 2012).In this section we introduce tensor product S-λ basis functions and the corresponding S-λ surface patch.LetA={Ai}i=0l1andB={Bj}j=0l2be two positive sequences, wherel1andl2may be ∞.F(s)andG(t)are the generating functions of A and B, respectively. LetA(m)={Ai(m)}i=0ml1andB(n)={Bj(n)}j=0nl2be convolution sequences of A and B, respectively.Fm(s)andGn(t)are the generating functions ofA(m)andB(n), respectively. Let(5)S〈m,n〉(s,t)=Fm(s)Gn(t)=∑i=0ml1∑j=0nl2Ti,j(m,n)sitj,(s,t)∈[0,R1¯)×[0,R2¯),whereR1¯andR2¯may be ∞,(6)Ti,j(m,n)=Ai(m)Bj(n),i=0,…,ml1;j=0,…,nl2.By convolution calculation, we have(7)Ti,j(m,n)=∑p=0i∑q=0jTi−p,j−q(1,1)Tp,q(m−1,n−1).S〈m,n〉(s,t)is called generating function of the positive sequence{Ti,j(m,n)}. Letλ1(s)(s∈[0,R1))andλ2(t)(t∈[0,R2))be two strictly monotone increasing continuous functions satisfyingλ1(0)=λ2(0)=0.λ1(s)maps[0,R1)onto[0,R1¯).λ2(t)maps[0,R2)onto[0,R2¯).λ1(s)andλ2(t)are called transformation factors.Definition 3.1A tensor product S-λ basis function is defined by(8)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Ti,j(m,n)[λ1(s)]i[λ2(t)]jS〈m,n〉(λ1(s),λ2(t)),0≤i≤ml1,0≤j≤nl2,where(s,t)∈[0,R1)×[0,R2).LetFm,i(s)denote a univariate S-λ basis function constructed byFm(s)andλ1(s)and letGn,j(t)denote a univariate S-λ basis function constructed byGn(t)andλ2(t). Then, we have(9)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Fm,i(s)Gn,j(t).The properties of the univariate S-λ basis functions can be extended to the tensor product S-λ basis functions. We present some properties of the tensor product S-λ basis functions as follows.Proposition 3.1Non-negative(10)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)≥0.Proposition 3.2Partition of unity(11)∑i=0ml1∑j=0nl2P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=1.Proposition 3.3Interpolation(12)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(0,0)=δi,0δj,0whereδk,l={1k=l0k≠lis the Kronecker's delta.Proposition 3.4Linear independence(13)∑i=0ml1∑j=0nl2ci,jP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=0⟺ci,j=0.Proposition 3.5Degree elevation(14)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=∑p=0l1∑q=0l2Ti,j(m,n)Tp,qTi+p,j+q(m+1,n+1)P〈m+1,n+1〉,〈i+p,j+q〉(s,t).Proposition 3.6Degree reduction(15)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Fm,i(s)Gn,j(t)=∑qF1,i−q(s)Fm−1,q(s)×∑pG1,j−p(t)Gn−1,p(t)=∑p∑qP〈1,1〉,〈i−p,j−q〉(s,t)P〈m−1,n−1〉,〈p,q〉(s,t),wheremax⁡{0,i−l1}≤p≤min⁡{l1(m−1),i},max⁡{0,j−l2}≤q≤min⁡{l2(n−1),j}.The proofs of the above properties are similar to the univariate cases, so we omit the details of the proofs.Proposition 3.7UnimodalityThe shape ofP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)satisfies one of the following four cases.(1)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)gets its maximum value at a unique(sm,i,tn,j), where(16)(λ1(s)F(λ1(s))dF(λ1(s))dλ1)|s=sm,i=im,(λ2(t)G(λ2(t))dG(λ2(t))dλ2)|t=tn,j=jn.P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)is monotonically increasing with variable s and t, respectively.P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)is monotonically increasing with variable s and gets the maximum value with variable t at a uniquetn,j, where(17)(λ2(t)G(λ2(t))dG(λ2(t))dλ2)|t=tn,j=jn.P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)is monotonically increasing with variable t and gets the maximum value with variable s at a uniquesm,i, where(18)(λ1(s)F(λ1(s))dF(λ1(s))dλ1)|s=sm,i=im.ByP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Fm,i(s)Gn,j(t)and the unimodality property of the S-λ basis functions (cf. Fan and Zeng, 2012), we get the proposition directly.(1) IfFm,i(s)andGn,j(t)aren't monotonically increasing, then they will get their maximum values atsm,iandtn,j, respectively. On this condition,P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)satisfies the first case.(2) If both ofFm,i(s)andGn,j(t)are monotonically increasing, thenP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)satisfies the second case.(3) and (4) If one ofFm,i(s)andGn,j(t)is monotonically increasing and the other one isn't monotonically increasing, thenP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)satisfies one of the third case and the fourth case.  □In this subsection, we present a tensor product S-λ surface patch constructed by means of the tensor product S-λ basis functions and study its important properties.Definition 3.2For a given control points sequence{V〈i,j〉}〈i=0,j=0〉〈ml1,nl2〉, a tensor product S-λ surface patchC(s,t)is defined by(19)C(s,t)=∑i=0ml1∑j=0nl2P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)V〈i,j〉.whereP〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)is the tensor product S-λ basis function.The main properties of the tensor product S-λ surface patch can be derived from the properties of the tensor product S-λ basis functions.Theorem 3.1The tensor product S-λ surface patch has the following geometric properties(1)Affine invariance.Convex hull property.Interpolation of the control pointV〈0,0〉.Adjusting the control pointV〈i,j〉, the largest effect of the adjustment will act at(sm,i,tn,j).Non-degeneracy.(1) and (2) Since the tensor product S-λ basis functions are non-negative (Proposition 3.1) and partition of unity (Proposition 3.2), the affine invariance property and the convex hull property of the tensor product S-λ surface patch are self-explanatory. The affine invariance guarantees that the shape of the tensor product S-λ surface patch is regardless of the choice of coordinate system. The convex hull property means that the tensor product S-λ surface patch is contained in the convex hull of its control mesh.(3) According to Proposition 3.3, the tensor product S-λ surface patch interpolates the control pointV〈0,0〉.(4) LetΔV〈i,j〉mean the adjustment acted onV〈i,j〉. It's obvious that the effect of the adjustment acted on surface isΔV〈i,j〉P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t). According to Proposition 3.7, we get that the largest effect of the adjustment acts at(sm,i,tn,j).(5) Since the tensor product S-λ basis functions are linearly independent (Proposition 3.4), we can verify that the tensor product S-λ surface patch is non-degenerate.  □From the degree reduction property of tensor product S-λ surface (Proposition 3.6), we haveC(s,t)=∑i=0ml1∑j=0nl2V〈i,j〉P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=∑i=0(m−1)l1∑j=0(n−1)l2V〈i,j〉P〈1,1〉,〈p,q〉(s,t)P〈m−1,n−1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t).Then, we get the de Casteljau's algorithm of the tensor product S-λ surface patch,{V〈0,0〉,〈i,j〉=V〈i,j〉,i=0,…,ml1,j=0,…,nl2;V〈r1,r2−1〉,〈i,j〉=∑p=0l1P1,p(s)V〈r1−1,r2−1〉,〈i+p,j〉,r1=1,…,m;r2=1,…,n;i=0,…,(m−r1)l1;j=0,…,(n−r2+1)l2.V〈r1,r2〉,〈i,j〉=∑q=0l2P1,q(t)V〈r1,r2−1〉,〈i,j+q〉,r1=1,…,m;r2=1,…,n;i=0,…,(m−r1)l1;j=0,…,(n−r2)l2.Therefore, for any(s0,t0)∈[0,R1)×[0,R2), we haveC(s0,t0)=V〈m,n〉,〈0,0〉.By selecting appropriate generating functions and transformation factors, we obtain some interesting tensor product S-λ basis functions.Example 3.1LetA(m)andB(n)be m-convolution and n-convolution of{1,1}, respectively, i.e.A(m)={(mi)}i=0m,B(n)={(nj)}j=0n, then the generating function isS〈m,n〉(s,t)=(1+s)m(1+t)n. Let the transform factors beλ1(s)=s/(1−s)andλ2(t)=t/(1−t). We have a tensor product S-λ basis function(20)P〈m,n〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Pm,i(s)Pn,j(t)=(mi)(nj)sitj(1−s)m−i(1−t)n−j,(s,t)∈[0,1]×[0,1].Obviously, it is the tensor product Bernstein basis function.Example 3.2LetA=B={1/k!}k=0∞, i.e. the generating functionS〈1,1〉=eset,λ1(s)=sandλ2(t)=t. We have a tensor product S-λ basis function(21)P〈1,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=sitje−se−ti!j!,(s,t)∈[0,∞)×[0,∞),which is the tensor product Poisson basis function.Example 3.3LetA(m)={(m+i−1i)}i=0∞,B={1/j!}j=0∞, i.e.S〈m,1〉(s,t)=(1−s)−met,λ1(s)=s/(1+s)andλ2(t)=t. We have a tensor product S-λ basis function(22)P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=(m+i−1i)si(1+s)−m−itje−tj!,(s,t)∈[0,∞)×[0,∞).It is a new kind of mixed tensor product basis function. Lets=−s,(23)P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=(−mi)si(1−s)−m−itje−tj!,(s,t)∈[−∞,0)×[0,∞),which is a tensor product of the Bernstein basis of negative degree (Goldman, 1999) and the Poisson basis (Goldman and Morin, 2000). The shapes ofP〈3,1〉,〈2,1〉(s,t)andP〈3,1〉,〈3,3〉(s,t)are shown in Fig. 1.Remark 3.1From these examples, we observe that the framework of the tensor product S-λ basis functions provides a unified scheme for dealing with the well-known tensor product basis functions and some new tensor product basis functions.In this section, we introduce triangular S-λ basis functions and triangular S-λ surface patch. Letμ=(μ1,μ2,μ3)be barycentric coordinates, whereμi≥0(i=1,2,3), andμ1+μ2+μ3=1. LetD={μ|μ1+μ2+μ3=1}be triangular domains andIm={(i,j,k)|i+j+k=m}be an index set, where i, j, k are natural numbers, m is positive integer. In order to deal with the infinite sequence case, we introduce index setIm′={(i,j,k)|i=m,j+k≥0}and triangular domainsD1={μ|μ1+μ2+μ3=1,μ1≠0}. LetIm=ImorIm′.Firstly, we give the definitions of triangular generating function and transformation factor triad.Definition 4.1For a positive sequence{A〈i,j,k〉}(i,j,k)∈Im, suppose that(24)S(μ)=∑(i,j,k)∈ImA〈i,j,k〉μ1iμ2jμ3k,(25)Sn(μ)=[S(μ)]n=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnA〈i,j,k〉(n)μ1iμ2jμ3k,where{A〈i,j,k〉(n)}is n-convolution of{A〈i,j,k〉}. WhenIm=Im,μ∈D, otherwiseμ∈D1. Then,Sn(μ)is called triangular generating function of{A〈i,j,k〉(n)}.By a recursive computation(26)A〈i,j,k〉(n)=∑p≤i,q≤j,r≤k(p,q,r)∈Im(n−1)A〈i−p,j−q,k−r〉A〈p,q,r〉(n−1),(i,j,k)∈Imn.Definition 4.2For a triangular domainD={μ|μ1+μ2+μ3=1}, letλi(μ)(i=1,2,3)be 3 continuous functions mapping D onto D and satisfy(a)λ1(μ),λ2(μ),λ3(μ)are linearly independent and∑i=13λi(μ)=1;λi(μ)is strictly monotone increasing with the variableμi, respectively;Ifμi=0, thenλi(μ)=0;Ifμi=1, thenλi(μ)=1.In order to simplify the notations,λi(μ)is abbreviated toλi. Furthermore, we give a lemma about functions sets{(λl1)i(λl2)j}i+j=m,l1,l2∈{1,2,3},l1≠l2, and{(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k}i+j+k=mas follows.Lemma 4.1For the functionsλi(i=1,2,3)given inDefinition 4.2, we have(1){(λl1)i(λl2)j}i+j=mis a linearly independent function set, wherel1,l2∈{1,2,3},l1≠l2;{(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k}i+j+k=mis a linearly independent function set.(1) Without loss of generality, we just study the linear independence of the function set{(λ1)i(λ2)j}i+j=m, i.e.∑i+j=mc〈i,j〉(λ1)i(λ2)j=0⟺c〈i,j〉=0.Obviously,λ1,λ2are linearly independent whenm=1. By mathematical induction, suppose that{(λ1)i(λ2)j}i+j=r, r is a natural number, is a linearly independent function set. Ifμ1=0, thenλ1=0, hence∑i+j=r+1c〈i,j〉(λ1)i(λ2)j=0⟺c〈0,r+1〉(λ2)r+1=0⟺c〈0,r+1〉=0.Thus, we have∑i+j=r+1c〈i,j〉(λ1)i(λ2)j=0⟺∑i+j=r+11≤i≤r+1c〈i,j〉(λ1)i(λ2)j=0⟺λ1∑i+j=r+11≤i≤r+1c〈i,j〉(λ1)i−1(λ2)j=0⟺c〈i,j〉=0,i+j=r+1,1≤i≤r+1.To sum up,{(λ1)i(λ2)j}i+j=mis a linearly independent function set. Similarly,{(λ2)i(λ3)j}i+j=mand{(λ1)i(λ3)j}i+j=mare linearly independent function sets as well.(2) For the function set{(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k}i+j+k=m, sinceλ1,λ2,λ3are linearly independent, suppose that{(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k}i+j+k=ris a linearly independent function set. Ifμ1=0, thenλ1=0, hence∑i+j+k=r+1c〈i,j,k〉(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k=0⟺∑j+k=r+1c〈0,j,k〉(λ2)j(λ3)k=0.Since{(λ2)j(λ3)k}j+k=r+1is linearly independent function set,c〈0,j,k〉=0,j+k=r+1. Thus∑i+j+k=r+1c〈i,j,k〉(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k=0⟺∑i+j+k=r+11≤i≤r+1c〈i,j,k〉(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k=0⟺λ1∑i+j+k=r+11≤i≤r+1c〈i,j,k〉(λ1)i−1(λ2)j(λ3)k=0⟺c〈i,j,k〉=0,i+j+k=r+1,1≤i≤r+1.To sum up,{(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k}i+j+k=mis a linearly independent function set.  □We now define the triangular S-λ basis functions as follows.Definition 4.3Let{λi}i=13be a transformation factor triad andSn(μ)be the triangular generating function of{A〈i,j,k〉(n)}(i,j,k)∈Im. Then a triangular S-λ basis function is defined by(27)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=A〈i,j,k〉(n)(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(λ1,λ2,λ3),where(i,j,k)∈Imn,μ∈Dorμ∈D1.In the following we give some important properties of the triangular S-λ basis functions.Proposition 4.1Non-negative(28)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)≥0.Proposition 4.2Partition of unity(29)∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=1.Proposition 4.3InterpolationWhen(i,j,k)∈Imn′, i.e.μ∈D1(30)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(1,0,0)=δj,0δk,0.When(i,j,k)∈Imn, i.e.μ∈D,(31)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(1,0,0)=δj,0δk,0;Pn,〈i,j,k〉(0,1,0)=δi,0δk,0;Pn,〈i,j,k〉(0,0,1)=δi,0δj,0.From Definition 4.2, we know that whenμ1=1λ1=1,λ2=λ3=0.Hence(32)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(1,0,0)=A〈i,j,k〉(n)(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(λ1,λ2,λ3)=A〈i,j,k〉(n)(1)i(0)j(0)kSn(λ1,λ2,λ3)=δj,0δk,0.When(i,j,k)∈Imn,μ1=0is allowed. Similarly, we havePn,〈i,j,k〉(0,1,0)=δi,0δk,0,Pn,〈i,j,k〉(0,0,1)=δi,0δj,0.□Proposition 4.4Linear independence(33)∑(i,j,k)∈Imnc〈i,j,k〉Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=0⟺c〈i,j,k〉=0.The sufficiency is trivial, we only need to prove the necessity. By Lemma 4.1, we have∑(i,j,k)∈Imnc〈i,j,k〉Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=0⟺∑(i,j,k)∈Imnc〈i,j,k〉A〈i,j,k〉(n)(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k=0⟺∑(i,j,k)∈Imncˆ〈i,j,k〉(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)k=0,⟺cˆ〈i,j,k〉=0wherecˆ〈i,j,k〉=c〈i,j,k〉A〈i,j,k〉(n). SinceA〈i,j,k〉(n)>0,c〈i,j,k〉=0.  □(34)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=∑(p,q,r)∈Im(n−1)P1,〈i−p,j−q,k−r〉(μ)Pn−1,〈p,q,r〉(μ),(i,j,k)∈Imn,where, whenImn=Imn,max⁡{0,i−m}≤p≤min⁡{i,m(n−1)},max⁡{0,j−m}≤q≤min⁡{j,m(n−1)},max⁡{0,k−m}≤r≤min⁡{k,m(n−1)}; whenImn=Imn′,p=m(n−1),0≤q≤j,0≤r≤k.From Eq.

Since0≤i−p≤mand0≤p≤m(n−1), we obtainmax⁡{0,i−m}≤p≤min⁡{i,m(n−1)}. Similarly,max⁡{0,j−m}≤q≤min⁡{j,m(n−1)},max⁡{0,k−m}≤r≤min⁡{k,m(n−1)}. IfImn=Imn′, thenIm(n−1)=Im(n−1)′. Therefore,p=m(n−1),0≤q≤jand0≤r≤k.  □Proposition 4.6Degree elevation(35)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=∑(p,q,r)∈ImA〈i,j,k〉(n)A〈p,q,r〉A〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉(n+1)Pn+1,〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉(μ).From Eqs. (24) and (27), we havePn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=∑(p,q,r)∈ImA〈p,q,r〉(λ1)p(λ2)q(λ3)rS(λ1,λ2,λ3)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=∑(p,q,r)∈ImA〈p,q,r〉A〈i,j,k〉(n)(λ1)i+p(λ2)j+q(λ3)k+rSn+1(λ1,λ2,λ3)=∑(p,q,r)∈ImA〈p,q,r〉A〈i,j,k〉(n)A〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉(n+1)Pn+1,〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉(μ).□Firstly, we show three special examples of the triangular S-λ basis functions.Example 4.1Let the positive sequence{A〈i,j,k〉}(i,j,k)∈I1={1,1,1}, i.e.S(μ)=μ1+μ2+μ3=1, andλ1(μ)=μ1,λ2(μ)=μ2,λ3(μ)=μ3. By Definition 4.3, we have(36)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=n!i!j!k!(λ1)i(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(λ1,λ2,λ3)=n!i!j!k!(μ1)i(μ2)j(μ3)k,μ∈D,i+j+k=n,which is a triangular Bernstein basis function.Let the positive sequence{A〈i,j,k−j〉}(i,j,k−j)∈Im′={(m+k−1k)(kj)}, i.e.S(μ)=∑k=0∞∑j=0kA〈m,j,k−j〉μ1mμ2jμ3k−j=μ1m(1−μ2−μ3)−m=1,m≠0, andλ1(μ)=μ1,λ2(μ)=μ2,λ3(μ)=μ3. Then, we have(37)P〈m,j,k−j〉(μ)=(m+k−1k)(kj)μ1mμ2jμ3k−j,μ∈D1,which is a new kind of basis function defined in triangular domain. We call it triangular Meyer–König–Zeller basis function.Example 4.3Given a rational triangular Bernstein basis function with weight coefficients{w〈i,j,k〉}(i,j,k)∈Im,Rm,〈i,j,k〉(μ)=w〈i,j,k〉B〈i,j,k〉m(μ)∑(p,q,r)∈Imw〈p,q,r〉B〈p,q,r〉m(μ),whereB〈i,j,k〉m(μ)is the triangular Bernstein basis function of degree m. Obviously, the rational triangular Bernstein basis function equivalent to a triangular S-λ basis function with generating functionS(μ)=∑(i,j,k)∈ImW〈i,j,k〉μ1iμ2jμ3k,μ∈D,whereW〈i,j,k〉=w〈i,j,k〉n!i!j!k!, transform factorsλi=μi(i=1,2,3). Thus, the framework of triangular S-λ basis functions includes the rational triangular Bernstein basis functions.Remark 4.1From Examples 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, we conclude that the framework of the triangular S-λ basis functions includes the triangular Bernstein basis functions, the rational triangular Bernstein basis functions and some other new triangular basis functions.By means of the triangular S-λ basis functions, we define a triangular S-λ surface patch as follows.Definition 4.4A triangular S-λ surface patch is defined by(38)Γ(μ)=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)V〈i,j,k〉,whereμ∈DorD1,{V〈i,j,k〉}is a set of control points.The triangular S-λ surface patch has important properties of surface modeling.Theorem 4.1A triangular S-λ surface patch has the following properties:(1)Affine invariance.Convex hull property.Interpolate the corner points.Non-degenerate.The boundary curves are S-λ curves.(1) The affine invariance is the important property for curves and surfaces modeling in CAGD. Suppose that a given triangular S-λ surface patchΓ(μ)is transformed by an affine transformation operatorA, i.e.A(Γ(μ))=A(∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)V〈i,j,k〉).Since the triangular S-λ basis functions are non-negative and a partition of unity,A(Γ(μ))=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)A(V〈i,j,k〉).Therefore the triangular S-λ surface patch is affine invariance.(2) The non-negativity and the partition of unity of the triangular S-λ basis functions guarantee that the triangular S-λ surface patch is included within the convex hull of the control points{V〈i,j,k〉}(i,j,k)∈Imn.(3) Benefit from the interpolation property of the triangular S-λ basis functions, the triangular S-λ surface patch interpolates the corner control points, i.e.Γ(1,0,0)=V〈mn,0,0〉. Moreover, when(i,j,k)∈Imn,Γ(0,1,0)=V〈0,mn,0〉;Γ(0,0,1)=V〈0,0,mn〉.(4) Suppose thatΓ(μ)collapses to a pointQ∈R3, then0=Γ(μ)−Q=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)(V〈i,j,k〉−Q).For anyν∈R3, we have∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)(V〈i,j,k〉−Q)•ν=0,where • means the inner product. Since the triangular S-λ basis functions are linearly independent,(V〈i,j,k〉−Q)•ν=0,(i,j,k)∈Imn.According to the arbitrariness of ν,V〈i,j,k〉−Q=0,(i,j,k)∈Imn.Hence, the triangular S-λ surface patch is non-degenerate.(5) The boundary curves of a triangular S-λ surface patch are the S-λ curves represented by the corresponding boundary control points of the triangular S-λ surface patch.WhenImn∈Imn, ifμ1=0, thenλ1=0, we have(39)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(0,μ2,μ3)={0,i≠0;A〈0,j,k〉(n)(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(0,λ2,λ3),j+k=mn.Hence, we obtain a boundary curve of the triangular S-λ path,Γ(0,μ2,μ3)=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(0,μ2,μ3)V〈i,j,k〉=∑j+k=mnA〈0,j,k〉(n)(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(0,λ2,λ3)V〈0,j,k〉.Since∑i=13λi=1,Pn,〈0,j,k〉(0,μ2,μ3)=A〈0,j,k〉(λ2)j(λ3)kSn(0,λ2,λ3),j+k=mn, are S-λ basis functions. ThenΓ(0,μ2,μ3)is an S-λ curve whose control points are the boundary control points,V〈0,0,mn〉,V〈0,1,mn−1〉,…,V〈0,mn,0〉. Similarly,(40)Γ(μ1,0,μ3)=∑i+k=mnPn,〈i,0,k〉(μ1,0,μ3)V〈i,0,k〉,(41)Γ(μ1,μ2,0)=∑i+j=mnPn,〈i,j,0〉(μ1,μ2,0)V〈i,j,0〉are S-λ curves as well.WhenImn=Imn′, letμ2=0,λ2=0, then we have(42)Pn,〈i,j,k〉(μ1,0,μ3)=0,j≠0;(43)Pn,〈mn,0,k〉(μ1,0,μ3)=A〈mn,0,k〉(n)(λ1)mn(λ3)kSn(λ1,0,λ3)=A〈mn,0,k〉(n)(λ3)k∑l≥0A〈mn,0,l〉(n)(λ3)l,k≥0.Obviously,Pn,〈mn,0,k〉(μ1,0,μ3)are S-λ basis functions. Hence, we obtain a boundary curve of the triangular S-λ path,(44)Γ(μ1,0,μ3)=∑k≥0Pn,〈mn,0,k〉V〈mn,0,k〉is an S-λ curve. Similarly,(45)Γ(μ1,μ2,0)=∑j≥0Pn,〈mn,j,0〉V〈mn,j,0〉is an S-λ curve as well.  □By the degree reduction property of the triangular S-λ basis functions (Proposition 4.5), we obtainΓ(μ)=∑(i,j,k)∈ImnPn,〈i,j,k〉(μ)V〈i,j,k〉=∑(i,j,k)∈Im(n−1)(∑(p,q,r)∈ImP1,〈p,q,r〉(μ)V〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉)Pn−1,〈i,j,k〉(μ).Then, we can get the de Casteljau's algorithm of the triangular S-λ surface patch,{V0,〈i,j,k〉=V〈i,j,k〉,(i,j,k)∈Imn,Vl,〈i,j,k〉=∑(p,q,r)∈ImP1,〈p,q,r〉(μ)Vl−1,〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉,(i,j,k)∈Im(n−l),l=1,2,…,n.WhenImn=Imn′, the number of basis functions is infinity, the corresponding de Casteljau algorithm is complex, we don't discuss it in this paper. The mainstream approach to deal with the problem is truncation (cf. Goldman and Morin, 2000).WhenImn=Imn, for anyμ0∈D, we haveΓ(μ0)=Vn,〈0,0,0〉. An example is shown in Fig. 2withm=2,n=3. Each l-level intermediate pointVl,〈i,j,k〉is determined by six(l−1)-level intermediate pointsVl−1,〈i+p,j+q,k+r〉and their correspondingP1,〈p,q,r〉(μ0)as showed in Fig. 2(right). Eventually, the black point in Fig. 2(left)V3,〈0,0,0〉means the value ofΓ(μ0).Moreover, similar to the case of S-λ curve, we point out that a triangular S-λ surface patch can be modified by adjusting the coefficientA〈i0,j0,k0〉of the triangular generating function. IfA〈i0,j0,k0〉is bigger, then the corresponding triangular S-λ surface patch is closer to the control pointV〈i0,j0,k0〉.Remark 4.2This provides a method for shape adjustment of the triangular S-λ surface patch, which does not require the adjustment of control points or parameters. An example is shown in Section 5.Example 5.1Tensor productS-λsurface patchAs we all know,Bi−m(s)=(m+i−1i)si(1+s)−m−iis the Bernstein basis function of negative degree (cf. Goldman, 1999),bj(t)=tje−tj!is the Poisson basis function (cf. Goldman and Morin, 2000). In Example 3.3, we show a kind of mixed tensor product basis functions, which is the tensor product ofBi−m(s)andbj(t). Since the number of the mixed tensor product basis functions is infinite, infinite control points are needed. In this example, we solve this problem by repeating the control points. For control points{Vi,j},i,j=0,1,2,…, letVi,j=Vp,j,i≥p,j=0,1,…,Vi,j=Vi,q,j≥q,i=0,1,…,where p, q are positive integers. Then, the tensor product S-λ surface patch(46)C(s,t)=∑i=0∞∑j=0∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)Vi,j=∑i=0p−1∑j=0q−1P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)Vi,j+∑i=0p−1[∑j=q∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)]Vi,q+∑j=0q−1[∑i=p∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)]Vp,j+[∑i=p∞∑j=q∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)]Vp,q,where∑j=q∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=Bi−m(s)[1−∑j=0q−1bj(t)],∑i=p∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=bj(t)[1−∑i=0p−1Bi−m(s)],∑i=p∞∑j=q∞P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t)=1−∑i=0p−1Bi−m(s)−∑j=0q−1bj(v)+∑i=0p−1∑j=0q−1P〈m,1〉,〈i,j〉(s,t).From the interpolation properties of the Bernstein basis function of negative degree and the Poisson basis function, we obtainlims→∞⁡S(s,0)=Vp,0,limt→∞⁡S(0,v)=V0,q,lims→∞t→∞⁡S(s,t)=Vp,q.Thus, on this condition,C(s,t)interpolates the corner points of its control mesh.For a given4×4control mesh, letp=4,q=4. In Fig. 3, two tensor product S-λ surfaces are shown.Example 5.2Shape modification of triangularS-λsurface patchA triangular S-λ surface patchΓ(μ)is defined byΓ(μ)=∑i+j+k=2A〈i,j,k〉[λ1(μ)]i[λ2(μ)]j[λ3(μ)]kS(λ1(μ),λ2(μ),λ3(μ))V〈i,j,k〉,whereS(μ)=μ12+μ22+μ32+μ1μ2+μ1μ3+μ2μ3, i.e.{A〈i,j,k〉}i+j+k=2={1,1,1,1,1,1},λ1(μ)=μ1,λ2(μ)=μ2,λ3(μ)=μ3and the control points areV〈2,0,0〉=[0,0,1.0],V〈1,1,0〉=[0.8,0,0.8],V〈1,0,1〉=[0,0.8,0.8],V〈0,2,0〉=[1.0,0,0],V〈0,1,1〉=[0.8,0.8,0.3],V〈0,0,2〉=[0,1.0,0].The surface patchΓ(μ)is shown in Fig. 4(the blue one).If the triangular generating functionS(μ)is replaced bySˆ(μ)=μ12+μ22+μ32+μ1μ2+μ1μ3+2μ2μ3, i.e.A〈0,1,1〉changes from 1 to 2, then we get the modified surface patchΓˆ(μ)=∑i+j+k=2Aˆ〈i,j,k〉[λ1(μ)]i[λ2(μ)]j[λ3(μ)]kSˆ(λ1(μ),λ2(μ),λ3(μ))V〈i,j,k〉,which is the green one shown in Fig. 4. Obviously,Γˆ(μ)is closer toV〈0,1,1〉(the red point in Fig. 4) thanΓ(μ).
