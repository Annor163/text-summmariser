@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The traditional design method for digital audio graphic equalizer using infinite impulse response filters usually has some deficiencies, including center frequency shift, narrower bandwidth at high frequency and inaccurate gain. In this paper, an improved method based on the modified bilinear transformation is proposed to design a digital audio graphic equalizer. The new bilinear mapping can compensate the center frequency shift, and pre-distorting the quality factors and optimizing the gains can correct the bandwidth and gain of each sub-band respectively. Experimental results reveal that both center frequency and bandwidth of the proposed digital graphic equalizer are strictly equal to the desired ones, and the average gain error decreases at least 2 dB.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The audio equalizer (EQ) is one of the most important audio effects and is widely used in many audio systems, such as broadcasting studio, sound console, audio workstation, sound recording, audio player, smart phone and mobile terminal [1–6]. By mainly changing the amplitude of audio signals in sub-bands, an EQ can emphasize or attenuate some frequency components, and thus render many special effects [7]. Most of the EQs can be divided into two basic types: parametric equalizer and graphic equalizer (GEQ). A parametric EQ usually has some adjustable parameters, including center frequency, bandwidth and gain, thus it is more flexible than a GEQ and can meet the professional application. Nevertheless, the parametric EQ is very difficult to operate for a lay person due to its complex configuration. As for the GEQ, the whole audio frequency band is divided into some sub-bands. Usually the number of sub-bands is 3, 5, 10, 15 or 31, and the gain of each sub-band is the only parameter which can be adjusted independently. Because the GEQ is simple and intuitive, it is widely used in many audio equipments, such as PDA, tablet PC, smart phone, MP3 player.Though designing a perfect digital GEQ is a challenging task, a few valuable methods have still be given. A GEQ can be considered as a kind of filter bank, but it is special one. Due to the variable band width, computational complexity, algorithm delay and userʼs demand, the perfect reconstruction filter bank is scarcely ever used in designing a digital GEQ. Most of the design methods for a digital GEQ derive from the analog filter design techniques. In 1983, based on the Hurwitz polynomial properties, Greiner and Schoessow applied positive and real functions to design a GEQ [8]. In 1986, Bohn proposed the constant-Q GEQ, including design requirement and trade-offs of constant-Q circuitry [9]. Park designed a high-speed continuous-time CMOS analog adaptive equalizer [10] for equalization in the read channels of magnetic recording in 1998. The GEQ is implemented as the combination of several bandpass filters covering different frequency bands. The above-mentioned three methods are suitable for designing an analog prototype EQ. So far the design methods of digital equalizer are as follows. In 2005, Lee et al. proposed an adjusted-Q digital GEQ employing the opposite filters [11]. By gracefully increasing the Q-factor of the opposite filters with increasing gain, the inter-band interference can be reduced effectively in all frequency range. In 2006, Holters proposed a digital GEQ design method based on developed higher-order band shelving filters [12]. The amplitude deviation in the transitional region between two neighbor bands is very low by Holtersʼs method. In 2007, Gerdes et al designed battery powered three-band GEQ [13] and amplifier for portable MP3 player. In 2009, Cecchi and Stefania proposed an approach comprising the fixed and adaptive GEQ [14], and applied it to an automobile.The infinite impulse response (IIR) filter is often employed to design the GEQ due to its low computational complexity and algorithm delay [15]. For an analog GEQ, the traditional design methods are good enough; but for a digital GEQ, they will result in an unexpected adjacent band interference and obvious deviations of center frequency, bandwidth and gain, especially in the sub-bands located in the high frequency region. To remedy these problems, an improved design method of the GEQ based on the modified bilinear transformation is proposed. This method combines the pre-distortion and optimization techniques to make the center frequencies and bandwidths of the GEQ equal to the desired ones, and its amplitude–frequency response is more accurate than the traditional design methods. As for the GEQ implementation, the program based on the proposed method is run on a personal computer, and the proper coefficients of GEQ are generated. These coefficients are then downloaded to a digital signal processor (DSP) to implement the audio equalization.The paper is organized as follows: The traditional design method of digital GEQ is described in Section 2. The improved design method is proposed in Section 3. Some simulations are given in Section 4. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 5.The schematic diagram of a digital audio GEQ is shown in Fig. 1[5]. Without loss of generality, we only discuss the case of bandpass filter (BPF), because the result for bandstop filter (BSF) is similar [14]. In Fig. 1, the input signal is first separately filtered with theBPFk,k=1,2,…,N, then multiplied by the gainGk,k=1,2,…,N, and finally merged them as output signal.In the Laplace domain (S-domain), the transfer function of the k-th constant-Q analog BPF is [9](1)Hk(s)=ΩdkQdkss2+ΩdkQdks+Ωdk2,k=1,2,…,NwhereΩdkis the desired analog center angular frequency of the k-th BPF,Qdkis the desired quality factor of the k-th BPF, defined by the ratio of filterʼs center frequency and bandwidth.When the bilinear mapping rule from S-domain to Z-domain is applied in Eq. (1)[14], i.e. s is replaced with the following equation(2)s=2Ts1−z−11+z−1whereTsis the sampling interval, the transfer function of the corresponding digital BPF in the Z-domain is(3)Hk(z)=2ΩdkTs(1−z−2)[4Qdk+2ΩdkTs+Qdk(ΩdkTs)2]+[2(ΩdkTs)2−8]Qdkz−1+[4Qdk−2ΩdkTs+(ΩdkTs)2]Qdkz−2The overall transfer function of the GEQ is the sum of theseHk(z)(4)H(z)=∑k=1N[GdkHk(z)]Eqs. (3) and (4) are the traditional design method for a digital GEQ.A 10-segment digital GEQ is designed as an example. The design parameters are chosen as shown in Table 1.The amplitude–frequency responses of analog BPFs and corresponding digital BPFs are shown in Fig. 2, and the overall amplitude–frequency responses of analog GEQ, digital GEQ and desired GEQ are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the side-effect of the design method based on bilinear mapping is obvious, especially in the high frequency region, the center frequency and bandwidth shift from its expected value. Moreover, the amplitude–frequency response of the digital GEQ seriously deviates from its expected value (5 dB) in Fig. 3. To overcome these drawbacks, a more efficient design method for the digital GEQ is expected.In the improved method, a modified mapping rule is introduced to make the digital center frequency correspond to the analog center frequency strictly, then the bandwidth of digital GEQ is adjusted by pre-distortion technique, and finally optimization technique is used to find out the best gain of each digital BPF.The bilinear mapping used in Section 2 is nonlinear [15], which makes the center frequency shift and bandwidth gradually become narrow. An intuitive solution to remedy the side-effect is to apply different mapping rules for different BPFs.The new mapping rule from S-domain to Z-domain for k-th BPFs is defined as(5)s=ck1−z−11+z−1In order to make the digital center frequencyωdkcorrespond to the analog center frequencyΩdkstrictly,s=jΩdkandz=ejωdkare substituted into Eq. (5), i.e.(6)jΩdk=ck1−e−jωdk1+e−jωdkThe parameterckcan be easily calculated as(7)ck=Ωdktanωdk2=ΩdktanΩdkTs2Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (5), we obtain the new mapping rule(8)s=ΩdktanΩdkTs21−z−11+z−1The relationship between digital frequency ω and analog frequency Ω is(9)Ω=ΩdktanΩdkTs2tanω2Thus substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (1), the transfer functionHk′(z)of the improved digital BPF can be written as(10)Hk′(z)=sinΩdkTs(1−z−2)(2Qdk+sinΩdkTs)−(4QdkcosΩdkTs)z−1+(2Qdk−sinΩdkTs)z−2The bandwidth change is usually solved by the simple frequency pre-distorted technique [16]. But it is easily proved in theoretically that it is not suitable for the GEQ, because it undermines the rule that the center frequency of constant-Q BPF is the geometric center of the upper- and lower-bound frequencies, which is shown in Appendix A. In this paper, instead of frequency pre-distortion, we deal with the problem by pre-distortingQdk. Assume thatQkis the best quality factor of the k-th BPF after pre-distortingQdk,ΩdkHandΩdkLare the analog upper- and lower-cutoff angular frequencies of the k-th BPF respectively. From Eq. (1), we have(11)ΩdkH=Ωdk+Ωdk2+4Qdk2Ωdk22Qdk(12)ΩdkL=−Ωdk+Ωdk2+4Qdk2Ωdk22QdkThus the bandwidth of the k-th analog BPF is(13)ΩdkH−ΩdkL=ΩdkQdkIn order to keep the bandwidth of the k-th digital BPF equal to the one of its corresponding analog version, theQdkshould be pre-distorted asQk. Thus theΩdkHandΩdkLare changed toΩkHandΩkLrespectively, i.e.(14)ΩkH=Ωdk+Ωdk2+4Qk2Ωdk22Qk(15)ΩkL=−Ωdk+Ωdk2+4Qk2Ωdk22QkFrom the frequency mapping rule in Eq. (9), we can obtain the corresponding digital upper cutoff angular frequencyωkHand lower cutoff angular frequencyωkLas follows(16)ωkH=2arctanΩkHtanωdk2Ωdk=2arctan(1+1+4Qk2)tanωdk22Qk(17)ωkL=2arctanΩkLtanωdk2Ωdk=2arctan(−1+1+4Qk2)tanωdk22Qkwherearctan(⋅)is the inverse tangent function. From Eqs. (16) and (17) the bandwidth of the k-th digital BPF is(18)ωkH−ωkL=2arctansinωdk2QkLetting the bandwidth of the digital BPF equal to its desired one, from Eqs. (13) and (18), we have(19)ωkH−ωkL=2arctan(sinωdk2Qk)=ΩdkTsQdk=ωdkQdkThe explicit expression ofQkis(20)Qk=sinωdk2tanωdk2QdkSubstituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (10), we can further writeHk′(z)as(21)Hk′(z)=sinωdk(1−z−2)(2Qk+sinωdk)−4Qkcosωdkz−1+(2Qk−sinωdk)z−2A second-order BPF usually has a relative wide transition band, which results in the adjacent band aliasing. Therefore, the amplitude–frequency response of the GEQ will shift certainly. From Eq. (4), we know that any sub-band will be inevitably affected by the others in an N-band GEQ. In order to keep the alteration of the overall amplitude–frequency response as small as possible, the gainGdkshould be pre-distorted asGk, i.e.GdkandGkshould satisfy the following equation set.(22){|∑k=1NGk⋅Hk′(ejω1)|=Gd1|∑k=1NGk⋅Hk′(ejω2)|=Gd2⋮|∑k=1NGk⋅Hk′(ejωN)|=GdNwhereGdk,k=1,2,…,N, is the desired amplitude–frequency response at the frequencyωdk.Unfortunately, Eq. (22) is not linear and has no analytic solution. To find out the gainGk, the optimization method can be used to solve the nonlinear equation set [17,18].Define the cost function J as(23)J=∑n=1N(Gdn−|∑k=1NGkHk′(ejωn)|)2The gradients ∇J of the cost function is(24)∇J=∂J∂Gi=−2∑n=1N(Gdn−|∑k=1NGkHk′(ejωn)|)∑k=1NGk(aknain+bknbin)|∑k=1NGkHk′(ejωn)|whereaknandbknare the real part and imaginary part ofHk′(ejωn)respectively. The detailed derivation of ∇J is shown in Appendix B.From Eq. (21), we have(25)akn=4sin2ωdksin2ωn−4Qksin2ωdksin2ωnsinωn+2sinωdk(2Qk−sinωdk)sin22ωn[2Qk+sinωdk−4Qkcosωdkcosωn+(2Qk−sinωdk)cos2ωn]2+[4Qkcosωdksinωn−(2Qk−sinωdk)sin2ωn]2(26)bkn=2sin2ωdksin2ωn−4Qksin2ωdksinωncos2ωn+2sinωdk(2Qk−sinωdk)cos2ωnsin2ωn[2Qk+sinωdk−4Qkcosωdkcosωn+(2Qk−sinωdk)cos2ωn]2+[4Qkcosωdksinωn−(2Qk−sinωdk)sin2ωn]2According to the steepest decent method [19], the updating rule ofGiis(27)Gi(m+1)=Gi(m)−μ⋅∂J∂Gi,m=1,2,…M,k=1,2,…,Nwhere μ is the step size. Eq. (27) is a typical gradient algorithm for solving the optimization problem. The convergence of the general gradient algorithm is discussed in detail in [19].Let γ denote the threshold controlling the iteration time. If|μ∂J∂Gi|<γor reach the maximum iteration number M, the iteration procedure will be terminated. At the same time, theGk,k=1,2,…,N, are outputted as the optimal gains.The final transfer function of the digital GEQ can be written as(28)H(z)=∑k=1N[GkHk′(z)]In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation experiments are given by three examples.Example 1Test for the center frequency and bandwidth in a 10-segment digital GEQAccording to Eqs. (10) and (28), the 10-segment GEQ in Section 2 is redesigned. The step size μ is 0.01, the sampling ratefsis 48 kHz, and the iteration number is 831. The GEQʼs parameters are calibrated by the proposed method and are shown in Table 2.The amplitude–frequency responses of the BPFs are shown in Fig. 4. We can find that the digital center frequency is corresponding to the analog center frequency exactly from Fig. 4 and Fig. 2, and the bandwidth change at high frequency region also becomes narrow. In Fig. 5, the overall gain of the GEQ obtained by the proposed method is closer to the desired version.The sub-band gains of a 10-segment digital GEQ are set as in Table 3. The step size μ is 0.01, the iteration number is 830, the calibrated gains can be also obtained in Table 3 and other parameters are the same as in Example 1.The overall amplitude–frequency responses of the GEQ by the traditional method and proposed method with gain calibration are shown in Fig. 6. We can see from Fig. 6 that the amplitude–frequency response by the proposed method is more accurate than the one by the traditional version, and its average amplitude error is reduced about 2 dB. Especially, for a typical design example, the filter gain is attenuation, but the gains at two adjacent borders are amplification. For example, when the center frequencies are62.5×2πrad,1K×2πradand8K×2πradin Fig. 6 respectively, the desired gains of digital GEQ are attenuation, the proposed method can still ensure the gains attenuation, not magnification by the traditional method.To illustrate the versatility of the proposed method, a 30-segment GEQ is also designed. The GEQʼs parameters are chosen as in Table 4.The step size μ is 0.01, the sampling ratefsis 48 kHz, and the iteration number is 5120. The parameters of the digital GEQ by proposed method are shown in Table 5.The overall amplitude–frequency responses of the GEQ designed by the traditional- and proposed-methods are shown in Fig. 7. We can see from Fig. 7 that the amplitude–frequency response of GEQ designed by the proposed method is almost coincident with the desired version, and is much better than the one designed by the traditional method. WhenGd3,Gd12,Gd19are changed to 0.707 (−3dB), 1.4125 (3 dB), 2.519 (8 dB) respectively, the amplitude–frequency responses of the GEQ are shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that the proposed method can keep the gain unchanged, but the results by the traditional design method cannot be accepted completely.
