@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The limitations of the available imaging modalities for prostate cancer (PCa) localization result in suboptimal protocols for management of the disease. In response, several dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging modalities have been developed, which aim at cancer detection through the assessment of the changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment due to angiogenesis. In this context, novel magnetic resonance dispersion imaging (MRDI) enables the estimation of parameters related to the microvascular architecture and leakage, by describing the contrast agent kinetics with a dispersion model. Although a preliminary validation of MRDI on PCa has shown promising results, parameter estimation can become burdensome due the convolution integral present in the dispersion model. To overcome this limitation, in this work we provide analytical solutions of the dispersion model in the time and frequency domains, and we implement three numerical methods to increase the time-efficiency of parameter estimation. The proposed solutions are tested for PCa localization. A reduction by about 50% of computation time could be obtained, without significant changes in the estimation performance and in the clinical results. With the continuous development of new technological solutions to boost the spatiotemporal resolution of DCE-MRI, solutions to improve the computational efficiency of parameter estimation are highly required.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tumor proliferation and the formation of metastasis are dependent on angiogenesis, i.e., the process by which a vascular network is formed to provide the tumor with oxygen and nutrients necessary for its growth, and with an escape route to enter the systemic circulation, thus allowing its spreading [1–3].In cancer, angiogenesis is a chaotic process leading to the formation of an irregular and dense network of tortuous and fragile microvessels, characterized by increased permeability, arteriovenous shunts, and complex flow patterns [4].Extensive research is focused on the development and testing of novel anti-angiogenic drugs aimed at blocking angiogenic processes and/or targeting angiogenic tumor vasculature [5]. Focal therapies for localized cancers are also available [6,7], but their efficient and timely use requires reliable diagnosis and accurate cancer delineation. In response to the need for early evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic response to angiogenic treatment, and for earlier and improved cancer localization, several dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging methods are being developed for in-vivo, non-invasive assessment of tumor angiogenesis [4,8,9]. To this end, research is especially focused on non-ionizing solutions with MRI and US [10–13].In DCE magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the injected contrast agent, typically based on gadolinium chelates, leaks across the vascular endothelium into the interstitium, thus offering the opportunity to probe tumor vasculature through the assessment of the contrast distribution between the intravascular and extravascular spaces. To this end, suitable pharmacokinetic models are fitted to contrast concentration time curves (CTCs) measured at each voxel by DCE-MRI, leading to the estimation of quantitative parameters that are related to the physiology underlying tumor angiogenesis [8,11,14].In this context, magnetic resonance dispersion imaging (MRDI) has recently been proposed as a new method to characterize the functional and structural changes in the tumor microvasculature, by describing the intravascular kinetics of an extravascular contrast agent as a convective-dispersion process [11,15]. The intravascular transport of the contrast agent from the injection site to the capillaries, where the contrast leakage in tissue takes place, is modeled by the convective-dispersion equation, thus enabling the characterization of the microvascular architecture [10,11,15]. In fact, dispersion is due to the combined action of molecular diffusion, due to Brownian motion of the contrast molecules, and convection through the vascular network, mainly determined, in the microcirculation, by the multipath trajectories in the microvascular bed [16]. This novel method has been tested for prostate cancer (PCa) localization with promising initial results [15,17], encouraging further research.In the United States, PCa has the highest incidence (27% of estimated new cancer cases) and the second highest mortality (10% of estimated cancers deaths) in males [18]. These statistics are comparable to the European figures [19] and, more in general, to those of developed countries [20]. Current PCa diagnostics, mainly relying on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test, Digital Rectal Examination (DRE), and repeated systematic biopsies [21,22], has several limitations for cancer localization, proper patient selection for active surveillance or therapy, and treatment guidance and follow-up [23]. This highlights an urgent need for reliable imaging methods able to localize PCa [21,24]. In this regard, assessment of the angiogenesis-related changes in the tumor microvasculature may provide a valid imaging option, based on the established link between cancer aggressiveness, that is the risk of developing metastasis, and the microvascular density (MVD), typically assessed by immunohistological analysis [3,25,26].In MRDI, parameters related to the microvascular architecture (dispersion parameter, κ) and to the microvascular permeability (leakage parameter, kep) are estimated at each voxel by fitting CTCs measured with DCE-MRI by a dispersion model. This leads to the generation of parametric maps which are able to highlight some of the features characterizing angiogenic processes and thus can reveal the presence of cancer. The proposed dispersion model describes the tissue contrast concentration as a convolution between the intravascular contrast concentration, described as a Brownian motion process according to the convective-dispersion equation, with the interstitium impulse response, represented by a mono-exponential decay, and describing the contrast leakage in the extravascular space.Due to the non-linear nature of the model, iterative least-squared-error minimization is used for parameter estimation. When the noise samples are independent, Gaussian-distributed, and with constant variance, the least-squares estimation (LSE) is equivalent to the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), which is known for its desirable mathematical and optimality properties, including sufficiency, consistency, efficiency, and parametrization invariance [27,28]. Several noise sources may corrupt DCE-MRI images including measurement noise, electronic noise in the receiver coils, thermal noise, and inductive losses in the sample [29,30]. In amplitude, the Gaussian distributed noise present in the acquired complex data is converted into Rician noise after computation of the signal magnitude. However, for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the Rician distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution [29]. In time, noise in consecutive frames can be assumed to be independent due to the Brownian motion of the contrast particles over time [31].The presence of the convolution integral in the dispersion model increases the computational burden of the fitting routine by introducing N2 multiplications at each iterative step, where N is the number of time samples in the CTC. This limitation can be overcome by finding a closed-form solution of the convolution integral in the time domain, thereby reducing the algorithm complexity to O(N).Another opportunity to avoid the computation of the convolution integral is offered by the Fourier domain, where, according to the convolution theorem, the convolution of two functions is transformed into a simple product [32,33]. Although the transformation in the Fourier domain through the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) involves again a number of multiplications proportional to N2, a more efficient implementation of the DFT, known as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), allows to reduce this number to NlogN[32,33]. As a result, studying the model in the Fourier domain may decrease the computational burden of the estimation method.Beside the reduction in the computation time, analytical solutions of the dispersion model permit the calculation of the analytical Jacobian, thus facilitating the investigation of model identifiability [34,35] and reduction [36–38].Based on the promising results obtained by MRDI for PCa localization, in this work three solutions to increase the computational efficiency of the method are proposed and tested in PCa. The proposed solutions are obtained (i) by finding a closed-form analytical solution of the convolution integral in the time domain; (ii) by finding the analytical expression of the Fourier transform of the model, thus replacing the convolution integral with a simple product; (iii) by numerically transforming the two terms of the convolution integral in the Fourier domain and inverse transforming their product, thus exploiting the computational advantages of the FFT. The new solutions boost the time performance of parameter estimation by reducing the number of operations to be performed at each step of the iterative fitting routine. Moreover, the shape of the objective function is also changed, leading to possible reduction in the estimation error [39]. The performance of the proposed solutions are tested by dedicated simulations, and compared with the original method in terms of computation time, accuracy, precision, repeatability, and robustness to noise of the estimation procedure. Moreover, a preliminary clinical evaluation is carried out on 15 patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy because of biopsy-proven PCa.The tissue concentration of a contrast agent in a voxel can be expressed as a weighted sum of the concentration in the extravascular and capillary compartments as(1)Ct(t)=vpCp(t)+veCe(t),where Ct(t) is the tissue contrast concentration, Cp(t) and Ce(t) are the intravascular and extravascular concentrations, respectively, andvpandveare the intravascular and extravascular fractional volumes, respectively.Assuming the volume transfer constant (Ktrans) for the transport of the contrast agent between the intravascular and extravascular spaces to be equal in both directions, the extravascular concentration kinetics can be described by the model of Tofts et al. [14] as(2)ve∂Ce(t)∂t=Ktrans(Cp(t)−Ce(t)).Solving Eq. (2) with initial conditions Ce(0)=Ct(0)=0, and further assumption of negligible contribution of the plasma compartment to Ct(t) (i.e.,vp≃0), the contrast concentration at each voxel for t≥0 is described as(3)Ct(t)=KtransCp(t)*e−kept,wherekep=Ktrans/veis the black-flux rate from the extravascular space into the plasma compartment, and the symbol * represents the convolution integral.The kinetics of the contrast agent in the intravascular space can be modeled as a convective-dispersion process, by which the Brownian motion of the contrast molecules, due to molecular diffusion, is superimposed to the spatial translation of the contrast bolus, due to the drag force of the carrier fluid (i.e., blood). A local characterization of the dispersion process is provided by the modified local density random walk solution of the convective-dispersion equation [10], which is described by(4)Cp(t−t0)=ακ2π(t−t0)e−κ(t−μ−t0)22(t−t0),where α is the time-integral of Cp(t), t0 is the theoretical contrast injection time, μ is the mean transit time of the contrast particles between injection and detection sites, and κ is the intravascular dispersion parameter, given by the local ratio between contrast convection (squared velocityv2) and dispersion (dispersion coefficient D). In the presence of convection through a microvascular network, dispersion is mainly determined by the multipath trajectories across the microvascular bed [16]. For these reasons, the local dispersion parameter has been adopted to characterize the microvascular architecture [10].If the kinetics of the extravascular leakage are much slower than the intravascular dispersion (i.e., kep≪κ), then the adiabatic approximation can be made [40], and the intravascular concentration Cp(t) in Eq. (3) can be substituted by Cp(t) given in Eq. (4). The resulting dispersion model is thus obtained as(5)Ct(t−t0)=Aκ2π(t−t0)e−κ(t−μ−t0)22(t−t0)*(e−kept).with A=Ktransα.A closed-form solution of Eq. (5) can be obtained as(6)Ct(t−t0)=Aκ8ze−kep(t−t0)+κμ·[e2zϖ(erf(zt+ϖ/t)−1)+e−2zϖ(erf(zt−ϖ/t)+1)],where erf represents the error function, and the following substitutions have been made:(7)z=12κ−kepϖ=12κμ2,with the condition κ>2kep, in accordance with the adiabatic approximation. A more detailed derivation of Eq. (6) can be found in Appendix A.Using the time-translation property, the Fourier transform of Eq. (5) can be calculated as(8)F[Ct(t−t0)](jω)=e−jωt0F[Ct(t)](jω),where Ct(t) can be written as(9)Ct(t)=Aκ2π1te−κ2t(t−μ)2u(t)*e−keptu(t),with u(t) being the unit step function described by(10)u(t)=1fort≥00fort<0.Defining f1(t) and f2(t) as(11)f1(t)=1te−κ2t(t−μ)2u(t)f2(t)=e−keptu(t),and using the convolution property, we can calculate the Fourier transform of Eq. (5) as(12)FAκ2πf1(t)*f2(t)jω=Aκ2πF1(jω)F2(jω),where F1(jω) and F2(jω) are the Fourier transforms of f1(t) and f2(t), respectively. This leads to the following solution in the frequency domain(13)FCt(t−t0)jω=1kep+jω·Aκ2e−jωt0+κμ12κ+jω−12e−212κμ212κ+jω.The derivation of Eq. (13) is explained in more detail in Appendix B.
