@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Linguistic distribution assessments with exact symbolic proportions have been recently presented. Due to various subjective and objective conditions, it is often difficult for decision makers to provide exact symbolic proportions in linguistic distribution assessments. In some situations, decision makers will express their preferences in multi-granular unbalanced linguistic contexts. Therefore, in this study, we propose the concept of linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions under multi-granular unbalanced linguistic contexts. First, the weighted averaging operator and the ordered weighted averaging operator for the linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions are presented. Then, we develop the transformation functions among the multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions. Finally, we present the application of the proposed linguistic distribution assessments in multiple attribute group decision making.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Using linguistic approaches to address decision problems implies the need for computing with words (CWW) [18,36,50,51]. In recent years, different linguistic computational models have been proposed [14,15,19,21,26,30,33–35,45]. Herrera and Martínez [21] proposed a notable symbolic model for CWW, which is called the 2-tuple linguistic representation model. The Herrera and Martínez model has been applied in a wide range of applications (e.g., analytic hierarchy process [7,9,10], supply chain management [44], and multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) [49]).However, the Herrera and Martínez model [21] can only guarantee accuracy in dealing with uniformly and symmetrically distributed linguistic term sets. To address linguistic term sets that are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed, different methods have been discussed and proposed [1,3,4,8,11–15,17,19,37,45]. Wang and Hao [45] extended the Herrera and Martínez model, providing a new version (i.e., the proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model) for CWW. Based on the concepts of symbolic proportions and the canonical characteristic values (CCVs), the Wang and Hao model can address linguistic terms, which do not have to be uniformly and symmetrically distributed. Herrera et al. [19] developed a linguistic methodology to address such linguistic term sets, which were defined as unbalanced linguistic term sets. Dong and Herrera-Viedma [8] and Dong et al. [11,14,15] further proposed a numerical scale model to integrate and extend the Herrera and Martínez model [21] and the Wang and Hao model [45], and the model of Herrera et al. [19].It is observed that decision makers express their preferences using single linguistic terms in all these mentioned models. Therefore, many methodologies for eliciting linguistic expressions in decision-making problems have been proposed [29,30,39,40,43,45,52]. Rodríguez et al. [39] introduced the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTS) for linguistic expressions using several successive linguistic terms. In the Wang and Hao model [45], linguistic information was represented by proportional 2-tuples, whose symbolic proportions were assigned to two successive linguistic terms. Based on the Wang and Hao model [45], Zhang et al. [52] proposed the concept of linguistic distribution assessments, in which symbolic proportions can be assigned to all of the linguistic terms in a linguistic term set. This paper continues to improve the linguistic distribution assessments initiated by Zhang et al. [52], filling the following three gaps:(1)There exist situations in which the linguistic term sets used by decision makers for assessment may be not uniformly and symmetrically distributed, i.e., the linguistic term sets may be unbalanced linguistic term sets.It is not always easy for decision makers to provide the symbolic proportions by means of precise and exact values in an uncertain decision environment. In that case, a better approach is to use interval symbolic proportions to address this issue instead of exact ones.Many problems are defined in contexts in which the linguistic assessments are assessed in linguistic term sets with different granularities of uncertainty. Different approaches have been developed to manage multi-granular contexts [5,13,16,20,22–25,27,31,32]. For example, Herrera and Martínez [22] developed a linguistic decision model to address multi-granular linguistic contexts in the linguistic hierarchy structure, and Mata et al. [32] proposed the Type-1 OWA methodology to support consensus reaching process in multi-granular linguistic contexts.Inspired by these ideas, in this paper we propose the concept of the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions and develop the transformation functions among the multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions. Then, we present the application of the proposed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments in MAGDM.The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic knowledge regarding the linguistic models and distribution assessments in a linguistic term set. Then, we propose the concept of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions in Section 3. Next, in Section 4, we propose the transformation functions among multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments. We apply the proposed linguistic decision making model in MAGDM in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss and describe several CWW methodologies and contrast them with the proposal in this paper. Finally, concluding remarks are included in Section 7.In this section, we review the relevant knowledge regarding the 2-tuple linguistic representation model, the proportional 2-tuple model and the distribution assessments in a linguistic term set. This section will provide the basis for this paper.LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be a linguistic term set with odd cardinality. The termli(i=0,1,…,g)represents a possible value for a linguistic variable, and the basic notations and operational laws of linguistic variables are introduced in [21,50]. The linguistic term set should satisfy the following two characteristics.(1)The set is ordered:li⩽lj⇔i⩽j.There is a negation operator:Neg(li)=lg-i,i=0,1,…,g.The number of the linguistic terms in a linguistic term set is called the granularity of this linguistic term set. For example, the granularity of L is g+1.The 2-tuple linguistic representation model represents the linguistic information by means of a 2-tuple(li,α), whereli∈Landα∈[-0.5,0.5). This linguistic representation model defines a transformation function between linguistic 2-tuples and numerical numbers.Definition 1[21]LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be as before andβ∈[0,g]be a value representing the result of a symbolic aggregation operation. A 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information toβis obtained by the function:Δ:[0,g]→L×[-0.5,0.5), whereΔ(β)=(li,α)withli,i=round(β)α=β-i,α∈[-0.5,0.5), with round being the usual rounding operation. The set of all linguistic 2-tuples is denoted byL‾, i.e.,L‾={(li,α)|li∈L,α∈[-0.5,0.5),i=0,1,…,g}.Clearly,Δis a one to one mapping function. Then,Δhas an inverse function withΔ-1:L‾→[0,g]withΔ-1((li,α))=i+α.A computational model has been developed in the following.(1)A 2-tuple negation operator:Neg((li,α))=Δ(g-(Δ-1(li,α))).A 2-tuple comparison operator: Let(li,α1)and(lj,α2)be two 2-tuples. Then(a)ifi<j, then(li,α1)is smaller than(lj,α2);ifi=j, then(i)α1=α2, then(li,α1),(lj,α2)represents the same information;α1<α2, then(li,α1)is smaller than(lj,α2).Several 2-tuple aggregation operators have been developed, such as the linguistic ordered weighted average (OWA) operator and the weighted average (WA) operator (see [21]).Based on the Herrera and Martínez model [21], Wang and Hao [45] provided a new (proportional) 2-tuple linguistic representation model for CWW. This model represents the linguistic information by means of proportional 2-tuples (see Definition 2).Definition 2[45]LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be a linguistic term set. LetI=[0,1]andIL≡I×L={(li,α)|α∈[0,1],li∈L}. Given a pair(li,li+1)of two successive terms of L, then any two elements,(li,α)and(li+1,β)of IL are called a symbolic proportion pair, andα,βare called a pair of symbolic proportions of the pair(li,li+1)ifα+β=1. A symbolic proportion pair(li,α)(li+1,1-α)can be denoted as(αli,(1-α)li+1), and the set of all symbolic proportion pairs is denoted byL‾‾, i.e.,L‾‾={(αli,(1-α)li+1)|α∈[0,1],i=0,1,…,g-1}.In the Wang and Hao model, the setL‾‾is called the proportional 2-tuple set generated by L, and the members ofL‾‾are called linguistic proportional 2-tuples.A computational model has been developed for the Wang and Hao model. Let(αli,(1-α)li+1)and(βlj,(1-β)lj+1)be any two proportional 2-tuples. Then.(1)A proportional 2-tuple comparison operator:(a)ifi<j, then(i)(αli,(1-α)li+1),(βlj,(1-β)lj+1)represents the same information wheni=j-1, andα=0,β=1;(αli,(1-α)li+1)<(βlj,(1-β)lj+1), otherwise.ifi=j, then(i)ifα=β, then(αli,(1-α)li+1),(βlj,(1-β)lj+1)represents the same information;ifα<β, then(αli,(1-α)li+1)>(βlj,(1-β)lj+1).The negation operator:Neg((αli,(1-α)li+1))=((1-α)lg-i-1,αlg-i).Wang and Hao developed the weighted and ordered weighted aggregation operators of proportional 2-tuples as well (see [45]).The semantics of linguistic terms used in the Wang and Hao model are defined by symmetrical trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT[b-δ,b,c,c+δ], which are varying in a 1-D characteristic. If the semantic ofliis defined byT[bi-δi,bi,ci,ci+δi], Wang and Hao [45] suggested that the canonical characteristic value (CCV) ofliis(bi+ci)/2, i.e.,CCV(li)=(bi+ci)/2.The CCV function overL‾‾is defined as Definition 3.LetL‾‾be as before.∀(αli,(1-α)li+1)∈L‾‾, the function CCV overL‾‾is:CCV‾‾(αli,(1-α)li+1)=αCCV‾‾(li)+(1-α)CCV‾‾(li+1)=αbi+ci2+(1-α)bi+1+ci+12, whereα,bi,ci∈[0,1],i=0,1,…,g-1.The functionCCV‾‾is a bijection, and the inverse ofCCV‾‾is denoted asCCV‾‾-1.For notational simplicity, we denoteCCVLas the CCV function over L in this paper.In the models of Herrera et al. [19] and Wang and Hao [45], unbalanced linguistic term sets are defined in different ways. Specifically, the concepts of the midterm and equally informative CCVs are used in these two models, respectively. Motivated by the midterm used in Herrera et al. [19] and the equally informative CCVs proposed in Wang and Hao [45], Dong et al. [11,13] redefines the balanced and unbalanced linguistic term sets based on numerical scales as Definition 4.LetL={l0,l1,…,lg},l∗be the midterm of L andCCVLbe as before. L is a linguistic term set that is uniformly and symmetrically distributed if the following conditions are satisfied:(1)There exists a unique constantλ>0such thatCCVL(li)-CCVL(lj)=λ(i-j)for alli,j=0,1,…,g.LetLR={l|l∈L,l>l∗}andLL={l|l∈L,l<l∗}. Let#(LR)and#(LL)be the granularities ofLRandLL, respectively. Then,#(LR)=#(LL).If L is a uniformly and symmetrically distributed term set, then L is called a balanced linguistic term set (with respect toCCVL). Otherwise, L is an unbalanced linguistic term set.Clearly, the unbalanced linguistic term sets in both the model of Herrera et al. [19] and the Wang and Hao model [45] satisfy the above definition.In the following, we introduce the concept of the linguistic distribution assessments.In the Wang and Hao model [45], symbolic proportions are assigned to two successive linguistic terms in a linguistic term set. Zhang et al. [52] proposed linguistic distribution assessments in which symbolic proportions are assigned to all linguistic terms in a linguistic term set.LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be a linguistic term set. Letm={(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g}, whereli∈L,βi⩾0,∑i=0gβi=1andβiis the symbolic proportion ofli. Then, m is called a distribution assessment of L.Letm={(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g}, whereli∈L,βi⩾0,∑i=0gβi=1be a distribution assessment ofL. The expectation of m is defined as:E(m)=∑i=0gβiΔ-1(li).There exits the following computational model for the distribution assessment of L. Letm1andm2be two distribution assessments of L. Then(1)A comparison operator:(i)ifE(m1)<E(m2), thenm1is smaller thanm2;ifE(m1)=E(m2), thenm1andm2have the same expectation.A negation operator:Neg({(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g})={(li,βg-i),i=0,1,…,g}.The weighted average operator and ordered weighted average operator of distribution assessments are proposed (see [52]).In Sections 3 and 4, we address the three gaps proposed in the introduction. In this section, we propose the concept of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions and the corresponding operational laws. In Section 4, we develop the transformation functions among unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions under multi-granular contexts.In Zhang et al. [52], the linguistic term set is uniformly and symmetrically distributed. However, in this paper, we base our model on the Wang and Hao model [45], i.e., the term set is not uniformly and symmetrically distributed. Based on the concepts of the balanced/unbalanced linguistic term sets and the linguistic distribution assessments, the balanced/unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments are defined as follows (see Definition 7).Definition 7LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be a linguistic term set. Letm={(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g}, whereli∈Landρi=[ρi̲,ρi‾]⊆[0,1]is the interval symbolic proportion ofli. If L is a uniformly and symmetrically distributed term set, then we call m a balanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions of L. Otherwise, we call m an unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions of L.For notational simplicity, we assume that L is the unbalanced linguistic term set in this paper. The linguistic distribution assessment in Zhang et al. [52] is a special case of the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments in this paper.For the interval symbolic proportionρi, it should satisfy that∑i=0gρi⊆[0,1]. We normalize the interval symbolic proportionρiaccording to Sugihara [42].LetL,CCVLover L andm={(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g}be as before. The expectation of m is defined as follows:(1)E(m)=[E(m)̲,E(m)‾],whereE(m)̲=CCVL-1(∑i=0g(ρi̲×CCVL(li))),E(m)‾=CCVL-1(∑i=0g(ρi‾×CCVL(li))).For notational simplicity, in this paperCCVL(E(m))=[CCVL((E(m)̲),CCVL(E(m)‾)].LetLe1={l0e1=verypoor,l1e1=poor,l2e1=average,l3e1=good,l4e1=verygood}. LetCCVe1be the CCV function overLe1. The CCVs and the semantics that are described by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in [0, 1] for the five terms inLe1are as below in Table 1.Without loss of generality, we assume that the unbalanced distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions ofLe1isme1={(l0e1,[0.1,0.3]),(l1e1,[0.1,0.3]),(l2e1,[0.1,0.3]),(l3e1,[0.1,0.3]),(l4e1,[0.1,0.3])}.Then, the expectation ofme1is:E(me1)=[CCVe1-1(0.25),CCVe1-1(0.75)]=56l1e1,16l2e1,16l2e1,56l3e1.Xu [48] proposed a formulation of the possibility degree of interval numbers. Based on the formulation in [48], we propose the comparison of the possibility degree of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions (see Definition 9).Let L andCCVLover L be as before and letm1andm2be two unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions of L. LetE(m1)=[E(m1)̲,E(m1)‾]andE(m2)=[E(m2)̲,E(m2)‾]be the expectations ofm1andm2, respectively. ThenP(m1⩾m2)=1,a̲⩾b¯a¯-b̲a¯-a̲+b¯-b̲,a¯>b̲anda̲<b¯0,a¯⩽b̲,wherea̲=CCVL(E(m1)̲),a¯=CCVL(E(m1)‾),b̲=CCVL(E(m2)̲),b¯=CCVL(E(m2)‾).Then,P(m1⩾m2)is called the possibility degree ofm1⩾m2.The comparison of the possibility degree ofm1⩾m2is as follows:(a)ifP(m1⩾m2)>0.5, thenm1≻m2, i.e.,m1is larger thanm2;ifP(m1⩾m2)=P(m2⩾m1)=0.5, thenm1∼m2, i.e., there is no difference betweenm1andm2;ifP(m1⩾m2)<0.5, thenm1≺m2, i.e.,m2is larger thanm1.(1) Generally, the expectations of probability distributions are used to address the comparison of probability distributions. Similarly, when discussing the linguistic distribution assessments in this paper, we compare the linguistic distribution assessments based on the expectations of the linguistic distribution assessments. (2) The comparison of interval numbers is a classical issue, and there have been several methods to compare interval numbers. However, in this paper, we do not plan to discuss the comparison of interval numbers. Instead, we simply adopt the method based on the formulation in [48] to compare interval numbers.Next, we propose the aggregation operators of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions.Let L be as before. Letm={m1,m2,…,mn}be a set of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions over L, wheremk={(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g},k=1,2,…,n. Letw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe an associated weighting vector that satisfieswk>0, and∑k=1nwk=1. The weighted average operator of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions (ULDAWA) is computed as(2)ULDAWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=li,ρi′,i=0,1,…,g,whereρi′=[ρi′̲,ρi′‾], andρi′̲=∑k=1nwkρik̲,ρi′‾=∑k=1nwkρik‾.Letm={m1,m2,…,mn}andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe as before. Then, the ordered weighted average operator of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions (ULDAOWA) is computed as(3)ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=li,ρi″,i=0,1,…,g,whereρi″=[ρi″̲,ρi″‾], andρi″̲=∑k=1nwkρiσ(k)̲,ρi″‾=∑k=1nwkρiσ(k)‾.{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}is a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmσ(k-1)⩾mσ(k)fork=2,3,…,n.Letm1e1=me1be as in Example 1 and letm2e1,m3e1,m4e1,m5e1be the other unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments overLe1, wherem2e1={(l0e1,0),(l1e1,[0.2,0.4]),(l2e1,[0.6,0.8]),(l3e1,0),(l4e1,0)},m3e1={(l0e1,0),(l1e1,0),(l2e1,[0.3,0.5]),(l3e1,[0.5,0.7]),(l4e1,0)},m4e1={(l0e1,[0.2,0.4]),(l1e1,[0.2,0.4]),(l2e1,[0.4,0.6]),(l3e1,0),(l4e1,0)},andm5e1={(l0e1,0),(l1e1,0),(l2e1,[0,0.2]),(l3e1,[0.6,0.8]),(l4e1,[0,0.2])}.Assume thatw=(0.2,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.2)T, thenULDAWA(m1e1,m2e1,m3e1,m4e1,m5e1)={(lie1,ρie1′),i=0,1,2,3,4}={(l0e1,[0.08,0.18]),(l1e1,[0.1,0.22]),(l2e1,[0.26,0.46]),(l3e1,[0.24,0.36]),(l4e1,[0.02,0.1])},whereρ0e1′=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.1×0+0.2×0+0.3×[0.2,0.4]+0.2×0=[0.08,0.18],ρ1e1′=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.1×[0.2,0.4]+0.2×0+0.3×[0.2,0.4]+0.2×0=[0.1,0.22],ρ2e1′=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.1×[0.6,0.8]+0.2×[0.3,0.5]+0.3×[0.4,0.6]+0.2×[0,0.2]=[0.26,0.46],ρ3e1′=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.1×0+0.2×[0.5,0.7]+0.3×0+0.2×[0.6,0.8]=[0.24,0.36],andρ4e1′=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.1×0+0.2×0+0.3×0+0.2×[0,0.2]=[0.02,0.1].According to the comparison of probability degree of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions, we obtainm5e1≻m3e1≻m1e1≻m2e1≻m4e1. ThenULDAOWA(m1e1,m2e1,m3e1,m4e1,m5e1)={(lie1,ρie1″),i=0,1,2,3,4}={(l0e1,[0.06,0.14]),(l1e1,[0.12,0.26]),(l2e1,[0.31,0.51]),(l3e1,[0.19,0.29]),(l4e1,[0.02,0.1])},whereρ0e1″=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.3×0+0.1×0+0.2×[0.2,0.4]+0.2×0=[0.06,0.14],ρ1e1″=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.3×[0.2,0.4]+0.1×0+0.2×[0.2,0.4]+0.2×0=[0.12,0.26],ρ2e1″=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.3×[0.6,0.8]+0.1×[0.3,0.5]+0.2×[0.4,0.6]+0.2×[0,0.2]=[0.31,0.51],ρ3e1″=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.3×0+0.1×[0.5,0.7]+0.2×0+0.2×[0.6,0.8]=[0.19,0.29],andρ4e1″=0.2×[0.1,0.3]+0.3×0+0.1×0+0.2×0+0.2×[0,0.2]=[0.02,0.1].In this paper, the above two operators are denoted as the ULDAWA operator and the ULDAOWA operator, respectively. Several desirable properties associated with the ULDAOWA operator are presented below. The desirable properties associated with the ULDAWA operator are similar to the ULDAOWA operator.Let L be as before. Let{m1,m2,…,mn}be a set of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions over L. For any ULDAOWA operator,ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)is an unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions of L.Based on Definition 11,ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)={(li,ρi″),i=0,1,…,g}, whereρi″=[ρi″̲,ρi″‾], andρi″̲=∑k=1nwkρiσ(k)̲,ρi″‾=∑k=1nwkρiσ(k)‾.mσ(k)={(li,ρiσ(k)),i=0,1,…,g}is the ith largest value in{m1,m2,…,mn}. Obviously, according to the definition of the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions (i.e., Definition 7),ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)is an unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions of L.□For any ULDAOWA operator(4)mink{mk}⩽ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)⩽maxk{mk}.Let{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmσ(k-1)⩾mσ(k)fork=2,3,…,n. From the implementation of the ULDAOWA operator, we haveE(mink{mk})=mink{E(mk)}=minkCCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)̲×CCVL(li)),CCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)‾×CCVL(li))⩽CCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)̲×CCVL(li)),CCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)‾×CCVL(li))=E(ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn))⩽maxkCCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)̲×CCVL(li)),CCVL-1∑i=0g(ρiσ(k)‾×CCVL(li))=maxk{E(mk)}=E(maxk{mk})Thus, this completes the proof of Property 2.□Let L be as before. Let{m1,m2,…,mn}be a set of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions over L, and{u1,u2,…,un}be a permutation of{m1,m2,…,mn}. Then, for any ULDAOWA operator(5)ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=ULDAOWA(u1,u2,…,un).Let{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmσ(k-1)⩾mσ(k)fork=2,3,…,nand{ϑ(1),ϑ(2),…,ϑ(n)}is a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatuϑ(k-1)⩾uϑ(k)fork=2,3,…,n. So{ϑ(1),ϑ(2),…,ϑ(n)}is a permutation of{m1,m2,…,mn}, and we haveσ(k)=ϑ(k),k=1,2,…,n. Then,ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=li,∑k=1nwkρiσ(k),i=0,1,…,g=li,∑k=1nwkρiϑ(k),i=0,1,…,g=ULDAOWA(u1,u2,…,un).Thus, this completes the proof of Property 3.□Let L be as before. Let{m1,m2,…,mn}be a set of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions over L. Let{d1,d2,…,dn}be another set of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions over L. Ifmk⩾dk(k=1,2,…,n), then(6)ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)⩾ULDAOWA(d1,d2,…,dn).Let{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmσ(k-1)⩾mσ(k)fork=2,3,…,nand{δ(1),δ(2),…,δ(n)}is a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatdδ(k-1)⩾dδ(k)fork=2,3,…,n. Becausemk⩾dk, we havemσ(k)⩾dδ(k). Thus,E(ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn))=E∑k=1nwkmσ(k)=∑k=1nwkE(mσ(k))⩾∑k=1nwkE(dδ(k))=E∑k=1nwkdδ(k)=E(ULDAOWA(d1,d2,…,dn)).This completes the proof of Property 4.□Ifmk=mfor allk=1,2,…,n, then, for any ULDAOWA operator(7)ULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=m.Let{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmσ(k-1)⩾mσ(k)fork=2,3,…,n. Letm={(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g}; becausemk=m, we haveULDAOWA(m1,m2,…,mn)=(li,∑k=1nwkρiσ(k)),i=0,1,…,g=(li,∑k=1nwkρik),i=0,1,…,g=(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g=m.This completes the proof of Property 5.□Following Section 3, in this section we consider the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions, which are assessed in different linguistic term sets with different granularities. Then, we propose the transformation functions among unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions under multi-granular contexts.LetLandL′be two linguistic term sets. LetCCVLandCCVL′be the CCV functions overLandL′, respectively. Then, the transformation function betweenLandL′is proposed as Proposition 1.Proposition 1LetL={l0,l1,…,lg}be a linguistic term set withCCVLbeing the CCV function over L andL′={l0′,l1′,…,lg′′}be the corresponding linguistic term set with the CCV functionCCVL′. The corresponding linguistic terml′∈L′associated withl∈Lis given as follows:(8)l′=CCVL′-1(CCVL(l)).The CCV functions over L andL′areCCVLandCCVL′, respectively, and the CCVs of l andl′areCCVL(l)andCCVL′(l′), respectively. Naturally, we hope thatCCVL(l)=CCVL′(l′). Consequently,l′=CCVL′-1(CCVL(l)).This completes the proof of Proposition 1.□LetLe2={l0e2=extremelypoor,l1e2=verypoor,l2e2=poor,l3e2=average,l4e2=good,l5e2=verygood,l6e2=extremelygood}. LetCCVe2be the CCV function overLe2. The CCVs and the semantics that are described by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in [0, 1] for the terms inLe2are as below in Table 2.According to Tables 1 and 2, and based on the transformation function as proposed in Proposition 1, we obtain the transformed linguistic terms associated with the linguistic terms inLe1. See Table 3as below.Based on Proposition 1, we propose the transformation functions among unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions (see Algorithm I).Letm={(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g}andm′={(lj′,ρj′),j=0,1,…,g′}be two unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions with respect to L andL′, respectively, whereli∈L,lj′∈L′,ρi=[ρi̲,ρi‾],ρj′=[ρj′̲,ρj′‾]. Algorithm I is proposed as follows.Input: The unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportionsm={(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g}, whereli∈L,ρi=[ρi̲,ρi‾]⊆[0,1].Output: The transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportionsm′={(lj′,ρj′),j=0,1,…,g′}associated withm={(li,ρi),i=0,1,…,g}.Step 1: Initialization. Leti=0and[ρj′̲,ρj′‾]=[0,0],j=0,1,…,g′.Step 2: Suppose thatCCV′-1(CCVL(li))=(αlj′,(1-α)lj+1′). Then,[ρj′̲,pj′‾]=[ρj′̲,ρj′‾]+α[ρi̲,ρi‾]and[ρj+1′̲,ρj+1′‾]=[ρj+1′̲,ρj+1′‾]+(1-α)[ρi̲,ρi‾].Step 3: Ifi<g, theni=i+1and go to step 2. Otherwise, output the transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportionsm′={(lj′,ρj′),j=0,1,…,g′}.Let the input beme1as in Example 1, and letL′beLe2as in Example 3, i.e.,i=0,1,…,4,j=0,1,…,6. Based on Algorithm I, we obtain the transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportionsme1′based onLe2and the transformation steps are as follows:Step 1: Letρ0e2=ρ1e2=ρ2e2=ρ3e3=ρ4e2=ρ5e3=ρ6e2=[0,0].Step 2:i=0,ρ0e2=[0,0]+1×[ρ0e1̲,ρ0e1‾]=[0.1,0.3],ρ1e2=[0,0]+0×[ρ0e1̲,ρ0e1‾]=[0,0],ρ2e2=ρ3e2=ρ4e2=ρ5e2=ρ6e2=[0,0];i=1,ρ0e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ1e2=[0,0]+0.5×[ρ1e1̲,ρ1e1‾]=[0.05,0.15],ρ2e2=[0,0]+0.5×[ρ1e1̲,ρ1e1‾]=[0.05,0.15],ρ3e2=ρ4e2=ρ5e2=ρ6e2=[0,0];i=2,ρ0e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ1e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ2e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ3e2=[0,0]+1×[ρ2e1̲,ρ2e1‾]=[0.1,0.3],ρ4e2=ρ5e2=ρ6e2=[0,0];i=3,ρ0e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ1e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ2e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ3e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ4e2=[0,0]+0.5×[ρ3e1̲,ρ3e1‾]=[0.05,0.15],ρ5e2=[0,0]+0.5×[ρ3e1̲,ρ3e1‾]=[0.05,0.15],ρ6e2=[0,0];i=4,ρ0e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ1e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ2e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ3e2=[0.1,0.3],ρ4e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ5e2=[0.05,0.15],ρ6e2=[0,0]+1×[ρ4e1̲,ρ4e1‾]=[0.1,0.3].Step 3: Output the transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportionsme1′={(l0e2,[0.1,0.3]),(l1e2,[0.05,0.15]),(l2e2,[0.05,0.15]),(l3e2,[0.1,0.3]),(l4e2,[0.05,0.15]),(l5e2,[0.05,0.15]),(l6e2,[0.1,0.3])}.LetL,CCVL,L′andCCVL′be as before. Letm={(li,βi),i=0,1,…,g}be an unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with interval symbolic proportions based on L, andm′={(lj′,ρj′),j=0,1,…,g′}be the corresponding transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments overL′, with respect to m. We have(9)CCVL(E(m))=CCVL′(E(m′)).Based on Proposition 1,li∈Lcan be transformed into a proportional 2-tuple defined in linguistic term setL′. Without loss of generality, we suppose that(10)CCVL(li)=CCVL′(αilp′,(1-αi)lp+1′)=αi×CCVL′(lp′)+(1-αi)×CCVL′(lp+1′)CCVL(lj)=CCVL′(αjlp-1′,(1-αj)lp′)=αj×CCVL′(lp-1′)+(1-αj)×CCVL′(lp′),where0⩽αi,αj⩽1(i,j=0,1,…,g),p=1,2,…,g′-1,li,lj∈L,lp-1′,lp′,lp+1′∈L′.According to Definition 8 and Eq. (10), we haveCCVL(E(m))=∑i=0g(ρi×CCVL(li))=∑p=0g′(ρp′×CCVL′(lp′)),whereρp′=∑αi×ρi+∑(1-αj)×ρj.Then, based on Algorithm I, we obtainρq′=∑αi∼×ρi+∑(1-αj∼)×ρj(q=0,1,…,g′)withCCVL(li)=CCVL′(αi∼lq′,(1-αi∼)lq+1′)CCVL(lj)=CCVL′(αj∼lq-1′,(1-αj∼)lq′)(li,lj∈L,lq-1′,lq′,lq+1′∈L′).Due toCCVL(li)=CCVL′((αilp′,(1-αi)lp+1′))=CCVL′((αi∼lq′,(1-αi∼)lq+1′))andαi(αi∼)is unique in the transformation process,ρp′=ρq′forp,q=0,1,…,g′.Thus,CCVL(E(m))=∑i=0gρi×CCVL(li)=∑i=0g′ρi′×CCVL′(li′)=CCVL′(E(m′)).This completes the proof of Proposition 2.□Proposition 2 shows that the transformations among unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions have no loss of information (in the sense of CCV values).To illustrate Proposition 2, Example 5 is provided.Example 5Continuing Example 4, we obtain thatCCVe1(E(me1))=[0.25,0.75],CCVe1′(E(me1′))=[0.25,0.75], i.e.,CCVe1(E(me1))=CCVe1′(E(me1′)).The transformation function is a bijection.Clearly,CCVLandCCVL′are bijections, soCCVL-1andCCVL′-1are bijections as well. We denotel′=CCVL′-1(CCVL(l))asl′=(CCVL′-1∘CCVL)(l). Then, we can obtain thatTF=CCVL′-1∘CCVLis a bijection.This completes the proof of Proposition 3.□In this section, we present the application of our proposal in MAGDM and provide an example to illustrate this application.LetE={E1,E2,…,El}be a set of decision makers and letw=(w1,w2,…,wl)Tbe the weighting vector of the decision makers, wherewk∈[0,1]denotes the weight of decision makerEkand∑k=1lwk=1(k=1,2,…,l). LetA={A1,A2,…,Am}be a set of alternatives andG={G1,G2,…,Gn}represent a set of attributes. Letν=(ν1,ν2,…,νn)Tbe the weighting vector of the attributes, whereνj∈[0,1]denotes the weight of attributeGj, and∑j=1nνj=1(j=1,2,…,n). LetLk={l0k,l1k,…,lgkk}(k=1,2,…,l)be the linguistic term sets used by the decision makerEk.Suppose that the decision makerEkprovides his/her evaluation information by an unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments matrixMk=[mijk]m×n, wheremijk={(lt,ijk,ρt,ijk),t=0,1,…,gk},lt,ijk∈Lk, andρt,ijk=[ρt,ijk̲,ρt,ijk‾]⊆[0,1].mijkrepresents the preferences given by the decision makerEkfor the alternativeAi(i=1,2,…,m)with respect to attributeGj(j=1,2,…,n). We aim to solve a MAGDM problem based on different linguistic term sets and the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions under multi-granular contexts. We call this decision problem the MAGDM with multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions.In following, we propose the method for solving the MAGDM with multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments, which is composed of four steps.Step 1: Selecting a basic linguistic term set and normalizing the individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments.LetLBbe the basic linguistic term set, whereLB∈{L1,L2,…,Ll}. Based on the Algorithm I, we obtain the normalized individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments matrixMk′=[mijk′]m×nassociated withMk=[mijk]m×n, wheremijk′={(lt,ijk′,ρt,ijk′)(t=0,1,…,gk′)}andlt,ijk′∈LB.Step 2: Aggregating the normalized individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments matrices into a collective one. Without loss of generality, we choose the ULDAOWA operator as the calculation operator in this step and the next step.LetMC=[mijC]m×nbe the collective unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment matrix, which is calculated by(11)mijC=ULDAOWA(mij1,mij2,…,mijl).Step 3: Obtaining the overall evaluation values of all alternatives.Letν=(ν1,ν2,…,νn)Tbe as before. Letz=(z1,z2,…,zm)T, whereziis the overall evaluation value of the alternativeAi.ziis computed by(12)zi=E(ULDAOWA(mi1C,mi2C,…,minC))wheremiC=ULDAOWA(mi1C,mi2C,…,minC).Step 4: Ranking the alternatives.Letzτ=maxi{z1,z2,…,zm}, which indicates the best alternative is alternativeAi,Ai∈{A1,A2,…,Am}.LetLk={l0k,l1k,…,lgkk}(k=1,2,…,l)andMk=[mijk]m×n, wheremijk={(lt,ijk,ρt,ijk),t=0,1,…,gk}andlt,ijk∈Lk, be as before. IfLBis used as the basic linguistic term set, then the overall evaluation value of the alternativeAiis denoted aszi. IfLB′(LB′≠LB)is used as another basic linguistic term set, then the overall evaluation value of the alternativeAiis denoted aszi′. We have(13)CCVB(zi)=CCVB′(zi′).We denotemijk′={(lt,ijk′,ρt,ijk′),t=0,1,…,gk′}as the transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment with respect tomijkbased onLB(LB∈{L1,L2,…,Ll}). Similarly, we denotemijk″={(lt,ijk″,ρt,ijk″),t=0,1,…,gk″}as the transformed unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment based onLB′. According to Proposition 2, we haveCCVk(E(mijk))=CCVB(E(mijk′))=CCVB′(E(mijk″))(k=1,2,…,l)i.e.,(14)CCV1(E(mij1))=CCVB(E(mij1′))=CCVB′(E(mij1″))CCV2(E(mij2))=CCVB(E(mij2′))=CCVB′(E(mij2″))……CCVl(E(mijl))=CCVB(E(mijl′))=CCVB′(E(mijl″))Then, according to the comparison arithmetic in Section 3, we get(15)mijk∼mijk′∼mijk″(k=1,2,…,l),It equals(16)mijσ(o)∼mijσ(o)′∼mijσ(o)″(o=1,2,…,l)where{σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n)}be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}such thatmijσ(o-1)≻mijσ(o). Then, based on Eq. (14), we obtain∑k=1lwk×CCVk(E(mijk))=∑k=1lwk×CCVB(E(mijk′))=∑k=1lwk×CCVB′(E(mijk″)), i.e.,∑k=1l∑t=0gk′wk×ρt,ijk′×CCVB(lt,ijk′)=∑k=1l∑t=0gk″wk×ρt,ijk″×CCVB′(lt,ijk″).Furthermore, based on Eqs. (15) and (16), we get∑k=1l∑t=0gk′wk×ρt,ijσ(o),k′×CCVB(lt,ijk′)=∑k=1l∑t=0gk″wk×ρt,ijσ(o),k″×CCVB(lt,ijk″), i.e.,CCVB(E(mijC))=CCVB′(E(mijC′)), wheremijC=ULDAOWA(mij1′,mij2′,…,mijl′)andmijC′=ULDAOWA(mij1″,mij2″,…,mijl″).Similarly, we obtainCCVB(E(miC))=CCVB′(E(miC′)).Thus,CCVB(zi)=CCVB′(zi′).This completes the proof of Proposition 4.□Proposition 4 indicates that in the proposed MAGDM, the method used to choose the basic linguistic term set has no influence on the final overall evaluation values (in the sense of CCV values).Example 6 is provided to illustrate Proposition 4.Example 6Continuing Example 3, letLe3={l0e3=extremelypoor,l1e3=verypoor,l2e3=alittlepoor,l3e3=poor,l4e3=average,l5e3=good,l6e3=alittlegood,l7e3=verygood,l83=extremelygood}. The CCVs and the semantics that are described by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in [0, 1] forLe3are defined in Table 4.Letme2={(l0e2,0),(l1e2,0),(l2e2,0),(l3e2,0),(l4e2,[0.1,0.3]),(l5e2,[0.6,0.7]),(l6e2,[0,0.1])}me3={(l0e3,0),(l1e3,0),(l2e3,0),(l3e3,[0,0.1]),(l4e3,[0.2,0.4]),(l5e3,[0.3,0.5]),(l6e3,[0.1,0.2]),(l7e3,0),(l8e3,0)}Suppose thatLB=Le1andLB′=Le2. We haveme1′=me1andme2″=me2.me2′={(l0e1,0),(l1e1,0),(l2e1,[0.02,0.06]),(l3e1,[0.32,0.52]),(l4e1,[0.36,0.52])},me3′={(l0e1,0),(l1e1,[0,0.08]),(l2e1,[0.26,0.52]),(l3e1,[0.3,0.52]),(l4e1,[0.04,0.08])},me1″={(l0e2,[0.1,0.3]),(l1e2,[0.025,0.075]),(l2e2,[0.075,0.225]),(l3e2,[0.1,0.3]),(l4e2,[0.075,0.225]),(l5e2,[0.025,0.075]),(l6e2,[0.1,0.3])},me3″={(l0e2,0),(l1e2,0),(l2e2,[0,0.1]),(l3e2,[0.2,0.4]),(l4e2,[0.325,0.55]),(l5e2,[0.075,0.15]),(l6e2,0)}.We can easily obtain:CCVe1(E(me1))=CCVe1(E(me1′))=CCVe2(E(me1″))=[0.25,0.75],CCVe2(E(me2))=CCVe2(E(me2″))=CCVe1(E(me2′))=[0.61,0.94],CCVe3(E(me3))=CCVe1(E(me3′))=CCVe2(E(me3″))=[0.395,0.75].Suppose thatw=(1/3,1/3,1/3)T. We obtain thatCCVe1(E(mC′))=CCVe2(E(mC″))=[0.4183,0.8133].To evaluate the comprehensive level of football players, football coaches are asked to perform an evaluation of each player’s performances in their past matches. In this paper, we consider the following four aspects (attributes): attitude, skills, physical quality, and speed. As these attributes may be influenced by subjective factors, such as the attitude, it’s difficult for the coaches to record the player’s attitude with exact values. Therefore, linguistic approaches are used. Furthermore, a player’s attitude may be positive if he plays well in one match but negative if he plays poorly in another match. Therefore, the linguistic distribution assessments are used.On the other hand, due to the limitation of the coaches’ ability, they cannot have a full understanding for all players’ past performances or entirely remember the details of all players’ past performances. Therefore, their evaluations mostly depend on their impressions of the players. The coaches can use interval values instead of exact values to record the players’ attitude in past performances, for example, the coach’s impression of a player’s positive attitude in past performances may be the probability of 0.4 to 0.5, i.e., the interval [0.4,0.5].Next, an example is provided to illustrate the application of our proposal in MAGDM. Four coaches(i.e.,E1,E2,E3,E4)are asked to evaluate four players(i.e.,A1,A2,A3,A4)and draw a final ranking of the players. The weighting vector associated with the coaches isw=(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25)T. The corresponding attributes areG={G1=attitude,G2=skills,G3=physicalquality,G4=speed}. The weighting vector of the attributes isν=(0.3,0.3,0.25,0.15)T.Suppose that the coachesE1,E2,E3andE4use the linguistic term setsL1,L2,L3andL4respectively. The linguistic term sets are listed below.L1={l01=extremelybad,l11=verybad,l21=bad,l31=medium,l41=good,l51=verygood,l61=extremelygood},L2={l02=verybad,l12=bad,l22=medium,l32=good,l42=verygood},L3={l03=extremelybad,l13=verybad,l23=alittlebad,l33=bad,l43=medium,l53=good,l63=alittlegood,l73=verygood,l83=extremelygood},L4=L2.LetCCV1,CCV2andCCV3be the CCV functions overL1,L2andL3, respectively. The CCVs and the semantics that are described by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in [0, 1] forL1,L2andL3are defined in Tables 5–7.The individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments matricesMk(k=1,2,3,4)are shown in Tables 8–11, respectively.Next, we apply the proposed method to solve the above MAGDM problem.Step 1: Without loss of generality, we chooseL2as the basic linguistic term set, i.e.,LB=L2. Based on the Algorithm I, we obtain the normalized individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments. The normalized individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessmentsM1′andM3′are shown in Tables 12 and 13, respectively.M2′=M2,M4′=M4(see Tables 9 and 11).Step 2: Based on Eq. (11), we aggregate the normalized individual unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments matrices into a collective one,MC(see Table 14).Step 3: The overall unbalanced linguistic distribution assessment ofAiis in Table 15.According to Eq. (12), we obtain the overall evaluation valueziofAi(i=1,2,3,4):z1=[CCV2-1(0.411),CCV2-1(0.6537)]=[(0.356l12,0.644l22),(0.3852l22,0.6148l32)],z2=[CCV2-1(0.3343),CCV2-1(0.6045)]=[(0.6628l12,0.3372l22),(0.582l22,0.418l32)],z3=[CCV2-1(0.438),CCV2-1(0.6941)]=[(0.248l12,0.752l22),(0.2236l22,0.7764l32)],z4=[CCV2-1(0.417),CCV2-1(0.6516)]=[(0.332l12,0.668l22),(0.3936l22,0.6064l32)].Step 4: Ranking the playersAiin accordance withzi(i=1,2,3,4).According to the comparison arithmetic introduced in Section 3, we obtain thatz3>z4>z1>z2. Then, the descending order of the four players is:A3≻A4≻A1≻A2.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Zhang et al. [52] proposed the concept of linguistic distribution assessments in a linguistic term set in which the linguistic term sets are uniformly and symmetrically distributed, and the symbolic proportions are exact values. In this paper, we propose the concept of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions, and the main contributions are as follows:(1)The linguistic term sets used by decision makers in this paper are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed, i.e., the linguistic term sets are unbalanced. Based on the unbalanced linguistic term sets and CCV functions, we propose the concept of unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions, in which the symbolic proportions are interval values instead of exact values.We define the unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments under multi-granular contexts and develop the transformation functions among the multi-granular unbalanced linguistic distribution assessments with interval symbolic proportions.We propose a novel linguistic approach to address linguistic distribution assessments in a decision making problem in this paper for the MAGDM.As mentioned in the introduction, several studies based on linguistic expressions (e.g., the HFLTS) have been proposed in recent years [2,27,37–39,44,50]. In future work, we will continue the studies aiming at the comparison between linguistic distribution assessments and HFLTS.
