@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we apply image decomposition for image denoising by considering the speckle noise in the (OCT) image as texture or oscillatory patterns. A novel second order total generalised variation (TGV) decomposition model is proposed to remove noise (texture) from the OCT image. The incorporation of the TGV regularisation in the proposed model can eliminate the staircase side effect in the resulting denoised image (structure). By introducing auxiliary splitting variables and Bregman iterative parameters, a fast Fourier transform based split Bregman algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model explicitly and efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real OCT images to demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art speckle noise reduction methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality and plays an important role in clinical diagnosis and monitoring of diseases of the retina. However, as with other imaging modalities based on the detection of coherence sources, OCT images are always corrupted by speckle noise, which can mask image features and pose significant challenges for image analysis algorithms [1]. Intensity fluctuation and motion artifact also decrease image quality, and presence of blood vessels in the image makes layer boundaries appear discontinuous. Thus pre-processing is often the first step in OCT image analysis.There are mainly two classes of methods for speckle noise reduction of OCT images. The first class of methods use physical techniques, such as the frequency compounding and polarization diversity [2–4], to address the noise problem before final image formation. However, these methods require significant modifications to design of the OCT system and can be too complicated and expensive to apply in practise. The second class of methods rely on post-processing of images and representatives of this class include filter based and diffusion based approaches.Adaptive adaptive filters calculate the value of each pixel using the information in the local neighbourhood of the pixel. These include hybrid median filter [5], homomorphic Wiener filter [6], enhanced Lee filter [7], symmetric nearest neighbour filter [8], Kuwahara filter [9], etc. Wavelet-based filters have the advantage of denoising on multiscale resolutions and are more desirable for dealing with correlated noise. Ozcan et al. [10] compared standard digital denoising methods and concluded that wavelet thresholding with the shift invariant wavelets yielded the best results. A spatially adaptive wavelet filter was described in [11], where a set of statistical wavelet coefficients were applied to estimate the thresholds for denoising OCT images. Mayer et al. [12] proposed a wavelet denoising algorithm for OCT images. The wavelet coefficients are first calculated based on local noise and structure estimation, and then weighted, averaged and used to reconstruct the denoised image. Puvanathasan et al. [13] proposed a type-II fuzzy thresholding algorithm for choosing wavelet filtering thresholds. Modern wavelets such as the dual tree complex wavelet [14] and curvelet transform [15] have also been employed to remove speckle noise from the OCT images which have produced better results than conventional wavelets.Diffusion based approach can smooth images while preserving edges of objects and it often leads to partial differential equations (PDEs). Salinas et al. [16] compared the performance of Perona–Malik isotropic diffusion with a nonlinear complex diffusion filter for OCT denoising [17]. The nonlinear complex diffusion was combined with the anisotropic coherence enhancing diffusion [18] for noise reduction, segmentation and structure analysis in retinal OCT images. Bernardes et al. [19] proposed a new formulation of the nonlinear complex diffusion filter. One particular advantage of their method over the original nonlinear complex diffusion is that the conductance parameter k in their formulation can be adaptive to the OCT data automatically. Bernardes’ method was then extended to 3D OCT image denoising with the GPU programming by Rodrigues et al. [20]. In addition, Puvanathasan et al. [21] presented the application of the interval type-II fuzzy anisotropic diffusion algorithm, where they considered the uncertainty in the calculated diffusion coefficient and appropriate adjustments to the coefficient were made. They also included edge information and a noise estimate in their formulation of the nonlinear isotropic diffusion for OCT speckle reduction.Variational models offer powerful processing capabilities for imaging [22–27]. They have been widely used in the last two decades but have only been used recently for OCT image processing [23,28]. In this paper, based on the classical Vese–Osher (VO) decomposition model, we propose a novel second order total generalised variation (TGV) decomposition model decomposing an OCT image into a structure image and a texture image, where the former is the denoised image whilst the latter contains the speckle noise in the original image. Unlike original VO model, the proposed method would not lead to the staircase effect (i.e. an undesirable jagged appearance) in the denoised image due to the TGV regularisation. In order to avoid directly calculating the high order nonlinear partial differential equations of the proposed model, the standard split Bregman algorithm [29] is modified by introducing three auxiliary splitting variables and three Bregman iterative parameters. Then, the original problem can be transformed into a multivariate optimisation problem. The analytical fast Fourier transform (FFT) [26,27,30] and generalised soft thresholding equations [31] can be elegantly applied to solve each variable efficiently without any iteration.The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, we propose an second order total generalised variation decomposition model that can remove the noise from the OCT image. The resulting denoised part does not have the undesirable staircase effect associated with the original VO model. Second, we develop the FFT-based split Bregman algorithm to solve the proposed model explicitly and efficiently.The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the proposed second order TGV decomposition model for OCT image denoising; Section 3 describes the split Bregman algorithm for solving the proposed variational model efficiently; Section 4 documents the experiments to validate the proposed method on both synthetic and real OCT images. A novel method to synthesise OCT images is introduced. Section 5 concludes the paper.
