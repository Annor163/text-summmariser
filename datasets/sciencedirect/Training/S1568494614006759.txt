@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As a special intuitionistic fuzzy set on a real number set, trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs) have the better capability to model ill-known quantities. The purpose of this paper is to develop some power geometric operators of TrIFNs and apply to multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) with TrIFNs. First, the lower and upper weighted possibility means of TrIFNs are introduced as well as weighted possibility means. Hereby, a new lexicographic method is developed to rank TrIFNs. The Minkowski distance between TrIFNs is defined. Then, four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs are investigated including the power geometric operator of TrIFNs, power weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs, power ordered weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs and power hybrid geometric operator of TrIFNs. Their desirable properties are discussed. Four methods for MAGDM with TrIFNs are respectively proposed for the four cases whether the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are known or unknown. In these methods, the individual overall attribute values of alternatives are generated by using the power geometric or power weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs. The collective overall attribute values of alternatives are determined through constructing the multi-objective optimization model, which is transformed into the goal programming model to solve. Thus, the ranking order of alternatives is obtained according to the collective overall attribute values of alternatives. Finally, the green supplier selection problem is illustrated to demonstrate the application and validation of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A human being who expresses the degree of membership of a given element in a fuzzy set (FS) [1] very often does not express corresponding degree of non-membership as the complement to 1. Thus, Atanassov [2] proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) using two characteristic functions expressing the degree of membership and the degree of non-membership of elements of the universal set to the IFS. It can effectively handle the presence of vagueness and hesitancy originating from imprecise knowledge or information. Many researchers have paid great attention to discussion on possible application of the IFS to the fields of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) and multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) [3–17]. They achieved many research results, such as aggregation operators [3–7], entropy measures [8], extension of classical decision making methods [9–13] and new decision making methods [14–17].As a generalization of fuzzy numbers [18], the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) is a special IFS defined on the real number set, which seems to suitably describe an ill-known quantity [19]. Currently, there are three kinds of typical IFNs: triangular IFN (TIFN) [19–28], trapezoidal IFN (TrIFN) [29–38] and interval-valued trapezoidal IFN (IVTrIFN) [39–41], which have attracted much research interest recently. Shu et al. [20] defined the concept of a TIFN in a similar way to that of the fuzzy number [18] and developed an algorithm for intuitionistic fuzzy fault tree analysis. Li [19] pointed out and corrected some errors in the definition of the four arithmetic operations over the TIFNs in [20]. Li [21] discussed the concept of the TIFN and ranking method on the basis of the concept of a ratio of the value index to the ambiguity index as well as applications to MADM problems in depth. Li et al. [22] defined the values and ambiguities of the membership degree and the non-membership degree for TIFNs as well as the value-index and ambiguity-index. Hereby a value and ambiguity based method is developed to rank TIFNs and applied to solve MADM problems in which the ratings of alternatives on attributes are expressed using TIFNs. Nan et al. [23] defined the ranking order relations of TIFNs, which are applied to matrix games with payoffs of TIFNs. Wang et al. [24] proposed new arithmetic operations and logic operators for TIFNs and applied them to fault analysis of a printed circuit board assembly system. Wan et al. [25] proposed the extended VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method for solving MAGDM with TIFNs. Wan et al. [26] investigated the possibility mean, variance and covariance of TIFNs. Wan [27] defined the possibility variance coefficient of TIFNs and applied to MADM with TIFNs. Wan and Dong [28] proposed the possibility method for MAGDM with TIFNs and incomplete weight information.As the extensions of the TIFNs, Wang [29] defined the TrIFN and IVTrIFN. Wang and Zhang [30] investigated the weighted arithmetic averaging operator and weighted geometric averaging operator on TrIFNs and their applications to MADM problems. Wei [31] investigated some arithmetic aggregation operators with TrIFNs and their applications to MAGDM problems. Du and Liu [32] extended fuzzy VIKOR method with TrIFNs. Wu and Cao [33] developed some families of geometric aggregation operators with TrIFNs and applied to MAGDM problems. Wan and Dong [34] defined the expectation and expectant score, ordered weighted aggregation operator and hybrid aggregation operator for TrIFNs and employed to MAGDM. Ye [35] developed the expected value method for intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy multicriteria decision-making problems. Ye [36] proposed the MAGDM method using vector similarity measures for TrIFNs. Zhang et al. [37] proposed a grey relational projection method for MAGDM based on TrIFNs. Wan [38] investigated four kinds of power average operators of TrIFNs, involving the power average operator (TrIFPA) of TrIFNs, weighted power average (TrIFWPA) operator of TrIFNs, power order weighted average (TrIFPOWA) operator of TrIFNs, and power hybrid average (TrIFPHA) operator of TrIFNs. Wan [39] firstly defined some operational laws of IVTrIFNs and developed the IVTrIFN weighted arithmetical average operator and weighted geometrical average operator. An approach to ranking IVTrIFNs is presented based on the score function and accurate function. The MAGDM method using IVTrIFNs is then proposed. Wan [40] defined the Hamming and Euclidean distances for IVTrIFNs and proposed the fractional programming method for the MADM problems using IVTrIFNs. Wu and Liu [41] defined some interval-valued trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operators and applied to MAGDM with IVTrIFNs.The above researches about IFNs mainly focus on the operation laws [19,20,24,37,38], aggregation operators [24,30,33,34,38,41], ranking methods [22,23,27–29,39,41], extension of classical decision making methods [25,32,37] and new decision making methods [27,28,35,40]. It is worthwhile to mention that the domains of the IFSs are discrete sets, which are also the same as fuzzy sets. TIFNs, TrIFNs and IVTrIFNs extend the domain of IFSs from the discrete set to the continuous set. They are the extensions of fuzzy numbers [30]. Compared with the IFSs, TrIFNs are defined by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers expressing their membership and non-membership functions. Hence, TrIFNs may better reflect the information of decision problems than IFSs. With the increasing complexity of modern society, continued expansion of the scale and the diversification of business, many large and important management decision optimization problems require many experts to participate in making decisions together. Therefore, the MAGDM problems with TrIFNs are of great importance for scientific researches and real applications.It should be pointed out that the aggregation operators of IFNs [25,30,31,33,34,40,41] did not consider the information about the relationship between the values being fused. In fact, the relationship between the variables being fused is very important to the decision making results for some real-life decision problems [5,42–47]. In this respect, the power-average (PA) operator and power OWA (POWA) operator developed by Yager [42] sufficiently consider the relationship between the variables being fused since their weighting vectors depend upon the input arguments and allow values being aggregated to support. Based on this, Xu and Yager [43] developed the power-geometric (PG) operator, weighted PG (WPG) operator, and power-ordered-weighted-geometric (POWG) operator and extended the PG and POWG operators to uncertain environments. Zhou and Chen [44] presented the generalized power average (GPA) operator and generalized power ordered weighted average (GPOWA) operator. They also proposed the linguistic generalized power average (LGPA) operator, the weighted linguistic generalized power average (WLGPA) operator and the linguistic generalized power ordered weighted average (LGPOWA) operator. Xu and Cai [45] proposed the uncertain power average operators for aggregating interval fuzzy preference relations. Xu and Wang [46] developed 2-tuple linguistic power average (2TLPA) operator, 2-tuple linguistic weighted PA operator (2TLWPA) and 2TLPOWA operator. Zhou et al. [47] presented the uncertain generalized power average (UGPA) operator and its weighted form, and the uncertain generalized power ordered weighted average (UGPOWA) operator. They also extended the GPA operator and the GPOWA operator to generalized intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment, and defined the generalized IF power averaging (GIFPA) operator and the generalized IF power ordered weighted averaging (GIFPOWA) operator. Xu [5] developed the IF power aggregation operators and the interval-valued IF power aggregation operators.However, the above power average and power geometric operators [12,42–47] cannot directly be applied to the case where the aggregation arguments are IFNs, such as TIFNs, TrIFNs and IVTrIFNs. Especially, the PG, WPG and POWG operators developed in [43] can only deal with real numbers and intervals, but are invalid if the aggregation arguments are IFNs. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to develop some power geometric operators of TrIFNs. Firstly, the weighted possibility means of TrIFNs are introduced and thereby a new method is presented to rank the TrIFNs. The Minkowski distance between TrIFNs is defined. Then, four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs are developed, including the power geometric (TrIFPG) operator of TrIFNs, power weighted geometric (TrIFPWG) operator of TrIFNs, power ordered weighted geometric (TrIFPOWG) operator of TrIFNs and power hybrid geometric (TrIFPHG) operator of TrIFNs. Their desirable properties are discussed in detail. These power geometric operators can take all the decision arguments and their relationships into consideration. Finally, four methods for MAGDM with TrIFNs are proposed for the four cases whether the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknown or known. Compared with the pertinent literature [5,21–41], this paper has the following difference and features:(i)Wan [36] investigated power average operators of TrIFNs, while this paper develops power geometric operators of TrIFNs. The fusion principles of power average operators and power geometric operators of TrIFNs are significantly different. The latter are the useful complements and extensions of the former. The decision methods proposed by Wan [36] and this paper are also remarkably different. The former utilized TrIFPHA operator to obtain the collective overall values of alternatives, whereas the latter constructs the goal programming model to derive objectively the collective ones. Furthermore, the former is only suitable to the situation whether the weight vector of DMs is known, while the latter can deal with the situation where the weight vector of DMs is known or unknown.The four methods proposed in this paper are based on power geometric operators of TrIFNs which can sufficiently consider the relationship among input TrIFNs arguments, effectively relieve the influence of unfair data on the fusion results, and thus make the decision results more reasonable. Whereas the methods proposed in [21–37,39–41] are based on the weighted arithmetic (or geometric) averaging operators of TrIFNs which consider the input arguments as independent, i.e., the inter-relationship among the individual arguments has not been captured by those operators.Wei [31] and Wu and Cao [33] simply calculated the distances between the TrIFNs and positive ideal solution to rank the TrIFNs. Such a ranking method of TrIFNs is a single-index approach, which is not always feasible and effective. Using the weighted possibility means, this paper proposes the lexicographic ranking method of TrIFNs, which is a two-index approach and more reasonable than the methods of [31,33]. The four methods proposed in this paper have wider range of real application, better flexibility and agility than the methods [5,33].The main contributions of this work are outlined as follows:(1)Define the weighted possibility means of the membership and non-membership functions for TrIFNs and thereby present a new lexicographic method to rank TrIFNs.Develop four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs (i.e., TrIFPG, TrIFPWG, TrIFPOWG, and TrIFPHG operators) and discuss their desirable properties.Propose four methods for MAGDM with TrIFNs respectively aimed at the four cases whether the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknown or known.The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 introduces the operation laws, weighted possibility means, ranking method and distance for TrIFNs. Four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs are developed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the problems of MAGDM with TrIFNs and proposes the corresponding decision methods. In Section 5, a green supplier selection example and the comparison analyzes are given. Section 6 ends the paper with some concluding remarks.In this section, the weighted possibility means of TrIFNs are investigated and thereby a lexicographic method is developed to rank the TrIFNs. The Minkowski distance for TrIFNs is also defined.Definition 1[29,30] Leta˜be an intuitionistic fuzzy number in the set of real numbers, whose membership function and non-membership function are defined as follows:μa˜(x)=x−ab−awa˜,ifa≤x<bwa˜,ifb≤x≤cd−xd−cwa˜,ifc<x≤d0,ifx<aorx>dandνa˜(x)=b−x+(x−a)ua˜b−a,ifa≤x<bua˜,ifb≤x≤cx−c+(d−x)ua˜d−c,ifc<x≤d1,ifx<aorx>d,respectively (see Fig. 1), where a, b, c, and d are all real numbers. The valueswa˜andua˜represent the maximum degree of membership and the minimum degree of non-membership, respectively, satisfying the conditions:0≤wa˜≤1,0≤ua˜≤1andwa˜+ua˜≤1. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy numbera˜is called the TrIFN, denoted bya˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜).The functionπa˜(x)=1−μa˜(x)−νa˜(x)denotes the hesitation ofa˜. The smallerπa˜(x), the more certaina˜. When b=c, a TrIFN reduces to a TIFN. Ifa≥0and one of the four values a, b, c, and d is not equal to 0, then the TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)is called a positive TrIFN, denoted bya˜>0. The TrIFNs discussed in the following are all positive TrIFNs.Definition 2[38]. Leta˜1=([a1,b1,c1,d1];wa˜1,ua˜1),a˜2=([a2,b2,c2,d2];wa˜2,ua˜2)be two TrIFNs andλ≥0. Then the operation laws for TrIFNs are defined as follows:(1)a˜1+a˜2=([a1+a2,b1+b2,c1+c2,d1+d2];wa˜1∧wa˜2,ua˜1∨ua˜2), where the symbols “∧” and “∨” mean min and max operators, respectively;a˜1a˜2=([a1a2,b1b2,c1c2,d1d2];wa˜1∧wa˜2,ua˜1∨ua˜2);λa˜1=([λa1,λb1,λc1,λd1];wa˜1,ua˜1);a˜1λ=([a1λ,b1λ,c1λ,d1λ];wa˜1,ua˜1).Analogous to the cut sets of TIFNs in [21], the definitions of the cut sets for TrIFNs are given.Definition 3For a TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜), the (α, β)-cut set, α-cut set and β-cut set are defined asa˜α,β={x|μa˜(x)≥α,νa˜(x)≤β},a˜α={x|μa˜(x)≥α}anda˜β={x|νa˜(x)≤β}, respectively, where0≤α≤wa˜,ua˜≤β≤1and0≤α+β≤1.It directly follows from Fig. 1, Definitions 1 and 3 that(1)a˜α=[aαl,aαu]=a+(b−a)αwa˜,d−(d−c)αwa˜,(2)a˜β=[aβl,aβu]=b−aua˜−β(b−a)1−ua˜,c−dua˜+β(d−c)1−ua˜.Motivated by [48], we give the definitions of the weighted possibility means of TrIFNs as follows.Definition 4Leta˜α=[aαl,aαu]be the α-cut set of a TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)with0≤α≤wa˜. The f weighted lower possibility mean of membership function for the TrIFNa˜is defined as:(3)m_μ(a˜)=∫0wa˜f(Pos[a˜≤aαl])aαldαThe f weighted upper possibility mean of membership function for the TrIFNa˜is defined as:(4)m¯μ(a˜)=∫0wa˜f(Pos[a˜≥aαu])aαudα,wheref:[0,wa˜]→Ris a non-negative, monotone increasing weighting function satisfying that∫0wa˜f(α)dα=wa˜andf(0)=0, Pos means possibility [48] and(5)Pos[a˜≤aαl]=supx≤aαlμa˜(x)=α,(6)Pos[a˜≥aαu]=supx≥aαuμa˜(x)=α.It can be seen from Eqs. (5) and (6) thatm_μ(a˜)=∫0wa˜f(Pos[a˜≤aαl])aαldα=∫0wa˜f(α)aαldα,m¯μ(a˜)=∫0wa˜f(Pos[a˜≥aαu])aαudα=∫0wa˜f(α)aαudα.Apparently,m_μ(a˜)is the f weighted lower possibility weighted average of the minimum of the α-cut set and it is why we call it the f weighted lower possibility mean of membership function.m¯μ(a˜)is the f weighted upper possibility weighted average of the maximum of the α-cut set and it is why we call it the f weighted upper possibility mean of membership function.Definition 5Leta˜β=[aβl,aβu]be the β-cut set of a TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)withua˜≤β≤1. The g weighted lower possibility mean of non-membership function for TrIFNa˜is defined as:(7)m_ν(a˜)=∫ua˜1g(Pos[a˜≤aβl])aβldβ,The g weighted upper possibility mean of non-membership function for TrIFNa˜is defined as:(8)m¯ν(a˜)=∫ua˜1g(Pos[a˜≥aβu])aβudβ,whereg:[ua˜,1]→Ris a non-negative, monotone decreasing weighting function satisfying that∫ua˜1g(β)dβ=1−ua˜andg(1)=1, and(9)Pos[a˜≤aβl]=supx≤aβlνa˜(x)=β,(10)Pos[a˜≥aβu]=supx≥aβuνa˜(x)=β.It yields from Eqs. (9) and (10) thatm_ν(a˜)=∫ua˜1g(Pos[a˜≤aβl])aβldβ=∫ua˜1g(β)aβldβ,m¯ν(a˜)=∫ua˜1g(Pos[a˜≥aβu])aβudβ=∫ua˜1g(β)aβudβ.Analogously,m_ν(a˜)is the g weighted lower possibility weighted average of the minimum of the β-cut set, which is why we call it the g weighted lower possibility mean of non-membership function. Likewise,m¯ν(a˜)is the g weighted upper possibility weighted average of the maximum of the β-cut set, which is why we call it the g weighted upper possibility meanm¯ν(a˜)of non-membership function.Definition 6For a TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜), the f weighted possibility mean of membership function is defined as:(11)mμ(a˜)=12[m_μ(a˜)+m¯μ(a˜)]and the g weighted possibility mean of non-membership function is defined as:(12)mν(a˜)=12[m_ν(a˜)+m¯ν(a˜)].If the TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)degenerates to the trapezoidal fuzzy numbera˜=[a,b,c,d], i.e.,wa˜=1andua˜=0, then,mμ(a˜)(ormν(a˜)) is just the f weighted possibility mean of fuzzy number defined in Definition 2 of [48] (see pp. 365). In this paper, the weighting function f measures the importance of α-cut set of TrIFNa˜; the weighting function g measures the importance of β-cut set of TrIFNa˜. In fact, Fullér and Majlender [48] have inspired us to introduce the notations of f weighted possibility mean of membership function and g weighted possibility mean of non-membership function for TrIFNa˜.Obviously,mμ(a˜)synthetically reflects the information on every membership degree and may be viewed as a central value that represents from the angle of membership function. Likewise,mν(a˜)synthetically reflects the information on every non-membership degree and may be viewed as a central value that represents from the angle of non-membership function.Example 1If f and g are respectively chosen as(13)f(α)=2αwa˜(α∈[0,wa˜])and(14)g(β)=2(1−β)(1−ua˜)(β∈[ua˜,1]),respectively, then, according to Eqs. (3), (4), (7) and (8), we have(15)m_μ(a˜)=13(a+2b)wa˜,(16)m¯μ(a˜)=13(d+2c)wa˜,(17)m_v(a˜)=13(a+2b)(1−ua˜),(18)m¯v(a˜)=13(d+2c)(1−ua˜).Further, from Eqs. (11) and (12), it yields that(19)mμ(a˜)=16(a+2b+2c+d)wa˜,(20)mv(a˜)=16(a+2b+2c+d)(1−ua˜).If the TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)degenerates to the triangular fuzzy numbera˜=(a_,a,a¯), i.e.,wa˜=1andua˜=0, then, it follows from Eqs. (15), (16) (or (17), (18)) and (19) (or (20)) that the weighted lower possibility mean, weighted upper possibility mean and weighted possibility mean of a triangular fuzzy numbera˜=(a_,a,a¯)are obtained as follows:M*(a˜)=(a_+2a)/3,M*(a˜)=(2a+a¯)/3andM¯(a˜)=(a_+4a+a¯)/6, respectively. These results of a triangular fuzzy number are the same as those of a triangular fuzzy number in Example 2.1 of [49].The weighted possibility means have some useful properties summarized in Theorem 1.Theorem 1Leta˜i=([ai,bi,ci,di];wa˜i,ua˜i)(i=1,2)be two TrIFNs withwa˜1=wa˜2andua˜1=ua˜2. Then for anyγ,τ∈R, the following equalities are valid:(21)mμ(γa˜1+τa˜2)=γmμ(a˜1)+τmμ(a˜2),(22)mν(γa˜1+τa˜2)=γmν(a˜1)+τmν(a˜2).Supposeγ>0andτ<0. Then by Definition 3, we get that the α-cut set of TrIFNγa˜+τb˜is(γa˜1+τa˜2)α=[γa1αl+τa2αu,γa1αu+τa2αl]. By Eq. (11), we obtainmμ(γa˜1+τa˜2)=12∫0wa˜1∧wa˜2f(α)[(γa1αl+τa2αu)+(γa1αu+τa2αl)]dα=12∫0wa˜1γf(α)(a1αl+a1αu)dα+12∫0wa˜2τf(α)(a2αu+a2αl)dα=γmμ(a˜1)+τmμ(a˜2).Similar reasoning holds for the caseγ<0andτ>0, or the caseγ>0andτ>0, or the caseγ<0andτ<0. Thus, Eq. (21) holds. By the same way, Eq. (22) can be proven. Namely, Theorem 1 is proven.It is noted that ifγ=τ=1, then by Theorem 1 the following equalities are valid:mμ(a˜1+a˜2)=mμ(a˜1)+mμ(a˜2)andmν(a˜1+a˜2)=mν(a˜1)+mν(a˜2).The possibility means of fuzzy numbers are similar to the mean of random variables. They can be used to quantitatively characterize the values of fuzzy numbers. Obviously, the greater the possibility mean, the bigger the corresponding fuzzy numbers.Letmμ(a˜i)andmν(a˜i)be the weighted possibility means of the membership and non-membership functions for TrIFNsa˜i=([ai,bi,ci,di];wa˜i,ua˜i)(i=1,2), respectively. Thereby, a new lexicographic method for rankinga˜1anda˜2can be summarized as follows:(1)Ifmμ(a˜1)<mμ(a˜2), thena˜1is smaller thana˜2, denoted bya˜1<a˜2;Ifmμ(a˜1)>mμ(a˜2), thena˜1is bigger thana˜2, denoted bya˜1>a˜2;Ifmμ(a˜1)=mμ(a˜2), then(a)Ifmν(a˜1)<mν(a˜2), thena˜1<a˜2;Ifmν(a˜1)>mν(a˜2), thena˜1>a˜2;Ifmν(a˜1)=mν(a˜2), thena˜1anda˜2represent the same information, denoted bya˜1=a˜2.The weighting functions f and g can be chosen as several forms, for example,f(α)=(n+1)αn(wa˜)n(α∈[0,wa˜]),g(β)=(n+1)(1−β)n(1−ua˜)n(β∈[ua˜,1]),where the power n is any positive integer, such as n=1, n=2. These power forms of weighting functions are motivated by Fullér and Majlender [48] (see Examples 1–3 in [48]). Hence, by introducing different weighting functions f and g, we can give different (case-dependent) importance to α-cut set and β-cut set of TrIFNa˜. For computation convenience, the weighting functions f and g are respectively chosen as Eqs. (13) and (14) in the following.Definition 7Leta˜i=([ai,bi,ci,di];wa˜i,ua˜i)(i=1,2)be two TrIFNs. The Minkowski distance betweena˜1anda˜2is defined as(23)dq(a˜1,a˜2)=[14(|m_μ(a˜1)−m_μ(a˜2)|q+|m¯μ(a˜1)−m¯μ(a˜2)|q+|m_ν(a˜1)−m_ν(a˜2)|q+|m¯ν(a˜1)−m¯ν(a˜2)|q)]1/q,whereq>0is a parameter of distance, which can be selected appropriately according to actual need.When q=1, the Minkowski distance is reduced to the Hamming distance of TrIFNs:(24)d1(a˜1,a˜2)=14(|m_μ(a˜1)−m_μ(a˜2)|+|m¯μ(a˜1)−m¯μ(a˜2)|+|m_ν(a˜1)−m_ν(a˜2)|+|m¯ν(a˜1)−m¯ν(a˜2)|);When q=2, the Minkowski distance is reduced to the Euclidean distance of TrIFNs:(25)d2(a˜1,a˜2)=14(|m_μ(a˜1)−m_μ(a˜2)|2+|m¯μ(a˜1)−m¯μ(a˜2)|2+|m_ν(a˜1)−m_ν(a˜2)|2+|m¯ν(a˜1)−m¯ν(a˜2)|2)1/2;Whenq→+∞, the Minkowski distance is reduced to the Chebyshev distance of TrIFNs:(26)d∞(a˜1,a˜2)=14max{|m_μ(a˜1)−m_μ(a˜2)|,|m¯μ(a˜1)−m¯μ(a˜2)|,|m_ν(a˜1)−m_ν(a˜2)|,|m¯ν(a˜1)−m¯ν(a˜2)|}.It is easy to prove that the distancedq(a˜1,a˜2)meets the properties: (i)dq(a˜1,a˜2)≥0; (ii)dq(a˜1,a˜2)=dq(a˜2,a˜1); (iii) Ifa˜3is any TrIFN, thendq(a˜1,a˜3)≤dq(a˜1,a˜2)+dq(a˜2,a˜3).By Eqs. (15)–(18), the Minkowski distance between TrIFNsa˜i(i=1,2)is calculated as follows:(27)dq(a˜1,a˜2)=112(|(a1+2b1)wa˜1−(a2+2b2)wa˜2|q+|(2c1+d1)wa˜1−(2c2+d2)wa˜2|q+|(a1+2b1)(1−ua˜1)−(a2+2b2)(1−ua˜1)|q+|(2c1+d1)(1−ua˜1)−(2c2+d2)(1−ua˜1)|q)1/q.Xu and Yager [43] introduced a power geometric operator of real numbers as follows:Definition 8[43] For real numbers{a1,a2,…,an}, the power geometric operator is defined asPG(a1,a2,…,an)=∏k=1nak(1+T(ak))/∑k=1n(1+T(ak)),whereT(ak)=∑j=1,j≠knSup(ak,aj)andSup(a,b)is the support for a from b, satisfying the properties: (1)Sup(a,b)∈[0,1]; (2)Sup(a,b)=Sup(b,a); (3) If|a−b|<|x−y|, thenSup(a,b)>Sup(x,y).In what follows, we investigate the power geometric operator under trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment.Definition 9Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs. The power geometric operator of TrIFNs is defined as(28)TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1na˜k(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k)),whereT(a˜k)=∑j=1,j≠knSup(a˜k,a˜j), andSup(a˜,b˜)is the support for TrIFNa˜from TrIFNb˜, satisfying the properties: (1)Sup(a˜,b˜)∈[0,1]; (2)Sup(a˜,b˜)=Sup(b˜,a˜); (3) Ifdq(a˜,b˜)<dq(x˜,y˜), thenSup(a˜,b˜)>Sup(x˜,y˜), where dqis the Minkowski distance defined in Definition 7.Thus, the more similar, the closer two values, the more they support each other.T(a˜k)can be considered as the support ofa˜kby all the other TrIFNs.Theorem 2Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs, wherea˜k=([ak,bk,ck,dk];wa˜k,ua˜k)(k=1,2,…,n). Then, the aggregation result by the TrIFPG operator is still a TrIFN as follows:(29)TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1nak1+T(a˜k)∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k)),∏k=1nbk1+T(a˜k)∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k)),∏k=1nck1+T(a˜k)∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k)),∏k=1ndk1+T(a˜k)∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k));∧1≤k≤n{wa˜k},∨1≤k≤n{ua˜k}.The proof of Theorem 2 can be easily completed according to Definition 2 by using the mathematical induction on n.The TrIFPG operator exhibits a number of properties desirable for an aggregation operator.Theorem 3IfSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c(c∈[0,1],k≠j), then the TrIFPG operator reduces to the geometric average (TrIFGA) operator of TrIFNs as follows:TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=TrIFGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1na˜k1/n.IfSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c, thenT(a˜k)=∑j=1,j≠knSup(a˜k,a˜j)=(n−1)c, and henceTrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1na˜k(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k))=∏k=1na˜k(1+(n−1)c)/[n(1+(n−1)c)]=∏k=1na˜k1/n.Thus, when all the supports are the same, the TrIFPG operator reduces to the TrIFGA operator. Especially, ifSup(a˜k,a˜j)=0(k≠j), i.e., all the supports are zero, then there is no support in the geometric aggregation process,T(a˜k)=0(k=1,2,…,n), and hence,(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k))=1/n, thusTrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1na˜k1/n.Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs. The TrIFPG operator has the following properties:(1)Boundedness:min{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}≤TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜m)≤max{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}.Commutativity: Leta˜′j(j=1,2,…,n)be any permutation of(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n). ThenTrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=TrIFPG(a˜′1,a˜′2,…,a˜′n).Idempotency: Ifa˜k=a˜(k=1,2,…,n), thenTrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=a˜.The proofs of commutativity and idempotency are obvious and omitted. We only prove boundedness.If we rewrite Eq. (28) intoTrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)wk, wherewk=(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k)), then we havewk≥0(k=1,2,…,m)and∑k=1nwk=1.Denotemin{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}=a˜minandmax{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}=a˜max. By Eq. (28), the following holds:a˜min=∏k=1n(a˜min)wk≤TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)wk≤∏k=1n(a˜max)wk=a˜max.That ismin{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}≤TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤max{a˜k|k=1,2,…,n}.In this subsection, a weighted form of TrIFPG operator has been presented.Definition 10The power weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs is defined as(30)TrIFPWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1na˜k(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n[(1+T′(a˜k))wk],whereT′(a˜k)=∑j=1,j≠knwjSup(a˜k,a˜j), andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weighting vector of TrIFNs{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}, satisfying that0≤wk≤1(k=1,2,…,n)and∑k=1nwk=1.Similar to Theorem 2, the following Theorem 5 is valid.Theorem 5Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs, wherea˜k=([ak,bk,ck,dk];wa˜k,ua˜k)(k=1,2,…,n). Then, the aggregation result by the TrIFPWG operator is still a TrIFN as follows:(31)TrIFPWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1nak(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n(1+T′(a˜k))wk,∏k=1nbk(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n(1+T′(a˜k))wk,∏k=1nck(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n(1+T′(a˜k))wk,∏k=1ndk(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n(1+T′(a˜k))wk;∧1≤k≤n{wa˜k},∨1≤k≤n{ua˜k}.IfSup(a˜k,a˜j)=0(k≠j), then the TrIFPWG operator reduces to the TrIFNs weighted geometric (TrIFWG) operator:TrIFPWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=TrIFWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)wk.SinceSup(a˜k,a˜j)=0(k≠j), thenT′(a˜k)=∑j=1,j≠knwjSup(a˜k,a˜j)=0, thus(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n[(1+T′(a˜k))wk]=wk/∑k=1nwk=wk. Hence,TrIFPWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)wk.It is should be noticed that, ifSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c(c∈[0,1],k≠j), then Theorem 6 generally does not hold. In fact, ifSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c(c∈[0,1],k≠j), thenT′(a˜k)=c(1−wk), thus(1+c(1−wk))wk/∑k=1n[(1+c(1−wk))wk]=wkis usually not valid. Therefore,TrIFPWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)wkgenerally does not hold.Analogously, the TrIFPWG operator has the properties such as idempotency, boundary, but commutativity property does not hold. In fact, leta˜j′(j=1,2,…,n)is any permutation of{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}. ThenTrIFPWGw(a˜′1,a˜′2,…,a˜′n)=∏k=1na˜′k(1+T′(a˜′k))wk/∑k=1n[(1+T′(a˜′k))wk]. Since∏k=1na˜′k(1+T′(a˜′k))wk/∑k=1n[(1+T′(a˜′k))wk]may not be equal to∏k=1na˜k(1+T′(a˜k))wk/∑k=1n[(1+T′(a˜k))wk], thenTrIFPWGw(a˜′1,a˜′2,…,a˜′n)=TrIFPWGw(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)usually does not hold.Based on the POWA operator [42] and the TrIFPWG operator, a new operator called the power ordered weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs is defined as follows.Definition 11Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be the TrIFNs. The power ordered weighted geometric operator of TrIFNs is defined as(32)TrIFPOWGω(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜σ(k))ωk,whereω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tis the vector associated with TrIFPOWG, satisfying that0≤ωk≤1(k=1,2,…,n)and∑k=1nωk=1.The associated vectorω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tcan be determined as follows:Denote the support of the jth largest TrIFN by all the other TrIFNs byT(a˜σ(j)), henceT(a˜σ(j))=∑l=1,l≠jnSup(a˜σ(j),a˜σ(l)), whereSup(a˜σ(j),a˜σ(l))indicates the support of lth largest argument for the jth largest argument,(σ(1),σ(2),…,σ(n))is a permutation of(1,2,…,n), such thata˜σ(k−1)≥a˜σ(k)(k=1,2,…,n), and the ranking method of TrIFNs can refer to Section 2.3.LetV(a˜σ(j))=1+T(a˜σ(j)),TV=∑j=1nV(a˜σ(j)),Rk=∑j=1kV(a˜σ(j)),R0=0. Then(33)ωk=QRkTV−QRk−1TV(k=1,2,…,n),whereQ:[0,1]→[0,1]is a basic unit-interval monotonic(BUM) function having the properties:Q(0)=0,Q(1)=1, andQ(x)>Q(y), ifx>y.Theorem 7Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs, wherea˜σ(k)=([aσ(k),bσ(k),cσ(k),dσ(k)];wa˜σ(k),ua˜σ(k))is kth largest argument ofa˜j(j=1,2,…,n). Then, the aggregation result by the TrIFPOWG operator is still a TrIFN as follows:(34)TrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(aσ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(bσ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(cσ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(dσ(k))ωk;∧1≤k≤n{wa˜σ(k)},∨1≤k≤n{ua˜σ(k)}.For different BUM functionQ(x), we have:(1)IfQ(x)=x, then the TrIFPOWG operator reduces to the TrIFPG operator, i.e.,TrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n).IfSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c(c∈[0,1],k≠j)andQ(x)=x, then the TrIFPOWG operator reduces to the TrIFGA operator, i.e.,TrIFPOWG(a˜1,…,a˜m)=TrIFGA(a˜1,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)1/n.IfQ(x)=1for allx>0, thenTrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=max{a˜i|i=1,2,…,n}. IfQ(x)=0for allx<1, thenTrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜m)=min{a˜i|i=1,2,…,n}.(1)IfQ(x)=x, thenωk=[1+T(a˜σ(k))]/∑j=1n[1+T(a˜σ(j))], and thus,TrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜σ(k))[1+T(a˜σ(k))]/∑j=1n[1+T(a˜σ(j))]=∏k=1n(a˜k)[1+T(a˜k)]/∑j=1n[1+T(a˜j)]=TrIFPG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n).IfSup(a˜k,a˜j)=c(c∈[0,1],k≠j) andQ(x)=x, then by Eq. (33) we haveωk=[1+T(a˜σ(k))]/∑j=1n[1+T(a˜σ(j))]=1/n. ThusTrIFPOWG(a˜1,⋯,a˜m)=TrIFGA(a˜1,⋯,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜k)1/n.IfQ(x)=1for allx>0, then by Eq. (33) we haveωn=ωn−1=…=ω2=0andω1=Q(R1/TV)−Q(R0/TV)=1−Q(0)=1. ThusTrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=(a˜σ(1))ω1(a˜σ(2))ω2…(a˜σ(n))ωn=a˜σ(1)=max{a˜i|i=1,2,…,n}.IfQ(x)=0for allx<1, then by Eq. (33) we haveωn−1=ωn−2=…=ω1=0andωn=Q(Rn/TV)−Q(Rn−1/TV)=Q(1)=1. ThusTrIFPOWG(a˜1,a˜2,⋯,a˜n)=(a˜σ(1))ω1(a˜σ(2))ω2⋯(a˜σ(n))ωn=a˜σ(n)=min{a˜i|i=1,2,⋯,n}.Analogously, the TrIFPOWG operator has the properties such as idempotency, boundary, and commutativity.It can be seen from Definitions 10 and 11 that the TrIFPWG operator weights the TrIFN arguments i.e., the closer an argument is to mid one(s), the more weight it is given, while the TrIFPOWG operator weights the ordered positions of the TrIFN arguments instead of weighting the arguments themselves, i.e., the closer the ordered position of the argument is to mid one(s), the more weight it is given. Therefore, weights represent different aspects in both the TrIFPWG and TrIFPOWG operators. However, both the operators consider only one of them. To solve this drawback, based on Definitions 8, 10 and 11, a new power hybrid geometric operator of TrIFNs is developed.Definition 12Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of the TrIFNs. The power hybrid geometric operator of TrIFNs is defined as(35)TrIFPHGω,w(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a˜′σ(k))ωk,whereω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tis the vector associated with TrIFPHG, satisfying that0≤ωk≤1(k=1,2,…,n)and∑k=1nωk=1.a˜′σ(k)is the kth largest of the weighted TrIFNsa˜′i=(a˜i)nwi(i=1,2,…,n),w=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe the weight vector ofa˜i(i=1,2,…,n), satisfying that0≤wi≤1and∑i=1nwi=1, n is the balancing coefficient.The determining approach of the above associated vectorω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tis similar to Eq. (33). Especially, ifw=(1/n,1/n,…,1/n)T, then the TrIFPHG operator reduces to the TrIFPOWG operator; ifω=(1/n,1/n,…,1/n)T, then the TrIFPHG operator reduces to the TrIFPWG operator.Theorem 9Let{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}be a set of TrIFNs, wherea˜′σ(k)=([a′σ(k),b′σ(k),c′σ(k),d′σ(k)];wa˜′σ(k),ua˜′σ(k))is kth largest argument of the weighted TrIFNsa˜′i=(a˜i)nwi(i=1,2,…,n). Then, the aggregation result by the TrIFPHG operator is still a TrIFN as follows:TrIFPHGω,w(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏k=1n(a′σ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(b′σ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(c′σ(k))ωk,∏k=1n(d′σ(k))ωk;∧1≤k≤n{wa˜′σ(k)},∨1≤k≤n{ua˜′σ(k)}.The above four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs can take the given arguments and their relationships into consideration. The TrIFPWG operator emphasizes the importance of each argument, the TrIFPOWG operator stresses the importance of the ordered position of each argument, while the TrIFPHG operator reflects the important degrees of both the given arguments and the ordered positions of the arguments.The TrIFNs geometric aggregation techniques, such as the TrIFNs weighted geometric operator and hybrid geometric operator [33], cannot capture the sophisticated nuances the DMs want to reflect in the aggregated value, i.e., these aggregation techniques neglect the relationships among the arguments provided by different individuals. However, the four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs have the non-monotony, the weight(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1n(1+T(a˜k))of the argumenta˜kdepends on all the input argumentsa˜k(i=1, 2, …, n) and allows the argument values to support and reinforce each other in the aggregation process, which can relieve the influence of unfair data (too large or too small TrIFNs) on the fusion results by assigning low weights to those unfair ones.Before employing these power geometric operators of TrIFNs, the crucial procedure is how to acquire the support measureT(a˜k)for the power geometric operators of TrIFNs, i.e., the support ofa˜kby all the other TrIFNs. In this subsection, an approach based on similarity is presented to determineT(a˜k).For TrIFNs{a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n}, the similarity matrix is constructed as follows:(36)S=(skj)n×n,whereskj=s(a˜k,a˜j)=1−dq(a˜k,a˜j)is the similarity degree ofa˜kanda˜j,dq(a˜k,a˜j)is the Minkowski distance defined in Definition 7.The average similarity degree ofa˜kby all the other TrIFNs is defined as follows:(37)AS(a˜k)=1n−1∑j=1,j≠knskj.NormalizedAS(a˜k)(k=1,2,…,n), the support degree ofa˜kis obtained as follows:(38)T(a˜k)=AS(a˜k)∑k=1nAS(a˜k).It is easily seen thatT(a˜k)meets the conditions of support function in Definition 9 can be regarded as the support measure in Definitions 9–12.Usually, in the process of group decision making, some individuals may assign unduly high to their preferred objects or unduly low preference values to their repugnant objects. The fundamental feature of the developed four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs is that the associated weights are determined by using the support measure. If the preference value provided by a DM is more similar (or closer) to all the other values provided by the other DMs, then these operators can assign the bigger weight to this preference value by using the support measure. Therefore, applying these operators to MAGDM field can not only make the group opinion more unanimous, but also make the decision result more consistent with actual situations.MAGDM refers to the problem of selecting or ranking alternatives associated with multiple non-commensurate and conflicting attributes for a decision group. There are k DMs Pt(t=1,2,…,k)who have to choose one of (or rank) m alternatives Ai(i=1,2,…,m)assessed on n attributes aj(j=1,2,…,n). Denote an alternative set byA={A1,A2,…,Am}and an attribute set byF={a1,a2,…,an}. Suppose that the performance of an alternative Aion an attribute ajgiven by DM Ptmay be represented as a TrIFNa˜ij(t)=([h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)];μij(t),νij(t)), whereμij(t)denotes the extent to which alternative Aibelongs to trapezoidal fuzzy number[h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)]on the attribute aj,νij(t)denotes the extent to which alternative Aidoes not belong to the trapezoidal fuzzy number[h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)]on the attribute aj, satisfying that0≤μij(t)≤1,0≤νij(t)≤1, andμij(t)+νij(t)≤1. Thus, the TrIFN decision matrixesA˜(t)=(a˜ij(t))m×n(t=1,2,…,k)can be elicited to concisely present the problem of MAGDM with TrIFNs.To eliminate the effect of different physical dimensions and measurements on the final decision, the matrixA˜(t)=(a˜ij(t))m×nmust be normalized intoR˜(t)=(r˜ij(t))m×n, wherer˜ij(t)=([r1ij(t),r2ij(t),r3ij(t),r4ij(t)];μij(t),νij(t))and(39)[r1ij(t),r2ij(t),r3ij(t),r4ij(t)]=[h1ij(t)h4j+,h2ij(t)h4j+,h3ij(t)h4j+,h4ij(t)h4j+]forbenefitcosts;(40)[r1ij(t),r2ij(t),r3ij(t),r4ij(t)]=[h1j−h4ij(t),h1j−h3ij(t),h1j−h2ij(t),h1j−h1ij(t)]forcostcosts,Hereh4j+=max{h4ij(t)|i=1,2,⋯,m;t=1,2,⋯,k},h1j−=min{h1ij(t)|i=1,2,⋯,m;t=1,2,⋯,k}.The above normalization method is able to preserve the property that the range of the trapezoidal fuzzy number[r1ij(t),r2ij(t),r3ij(t),r4ij(t)]belongs to the closed interval [0, 1].For the ith line elementsr˜i1(t),r˜i2(t),…,r˜in(t)of matrixR˜(t)=(r˜ij(t))m×n, the similarity matrix is constructed by Eq. (36) as follows:(41)Si(t)=(sikj(t))n×n,where the similarity degreesikj(t)=s(r˜ik(t),r˜ij(t))=1−dq(r˜ik(t),r˜ij(t)),dq(r˜ik(t),r˜ij(t))is the Minkowski distance defined in Definition 7.By Eq. (37) the average similarity degree of attribute valuer˜ik(t)by all the other attribute valuesr˜ij(t)(j=1,2,…,n,j≠k)is computed as(42)AS(r˜ik(t))=1n−1∑j=1,j≠knsikj(t).By Eq. (38), the support degree of attribute valuer˜ik(t)by all the other attribute valuesr˜ik(t)(j=1,2,…,n,j≠k)is computed as(43)T(r˜ik(t))=AS(r˜ik(t))∑j=1nAS(r˜ij(t)).By substitutingT(a˜k)of Definition 9 byT(r˜ik(t))and utilizing the TrIFPG operator, the individual overall attribute value of alternative Aigiven by DM Ptis derived as follows:(44)a˜i(t)=([ai(t),bi(t),ci(t),di(t)];μi(t),νi(t))=TrIFPG(r˜i1(t),r˜i2(t),…,r˜in(t))=∏j=1n(r1ij(t))1+T(r˜ij(t))/∑j=1n(1+T(r˜ij(t))),∏j=1n(r2ij(t))1+T(r˜ij(t))/∑j=1n(1+T(r˜ij(t))),∏j=1n(r3ij(t))1+T(r˜ij(t))/∑j=1n(1+T(r˜ij(t))),∏j=1n(r4ij(t))1+T(r˜ij(t))/∑j=1n(1+T(r˜ij(t)));∧1≤j≤n{μij(t)},∨1≤j≤n{νij(t)}(i=1,2,…,m;t=1,2,…,k).Remark 3If the weight vector of attributesW=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis known, then the individual overall attribute value of alternative Aigiven by DM Ptcan be derived as follows:(45)a˜i(t)=([ai(t),bi(t),ci(t),di(t)];μi(t),νi(t))=TrIFWPGW(r˜i1(t),r˜i2(t),…,r˜in(t))=∏j=1n(r1ij(t))[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj/∑j=1n[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj,∏j=1n(r2ij(t))[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj/∑j=1n[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj,∏j=1n(r3ij(t))[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj/∑j=1n[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj,∏j=1n(r4ij(t))[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj/∑j=1n[1+T(r˜ij(t))]wj;∧1≤j≤n{μij(t)},∨1≤j≤n{νij(t)}(i=1,2,…,m;t=1,2,…,k).The aggregation of fuzzy opinions is an important component of group decision analysis with fuzzy information. In fuzzy group decision analysis it is often required that individual fuzzy opinions be aggregated to form group consensus as the basis of group decision.Let the collective overall attribute value of alternative Aibea˜i=([ai,bi,ci,di];μi,νi). In general, the individual fuzzy opinionsa˜i(1),a˜i(2),…,a˜i(k)for alternative Aiare widely dispersed. In order to achieve the maximum agreement, the individual fuzzy opinionsa˜i(1),a˜i(2),…,a˜i(k)should move towards the collective fuzzy opiniona˜i. This is the premise on the basis of which a collective fuzzy opinion is generated [50]. If the individual fuzzy opinionsa˜i(1),a˜i(2),…,a˜i(k)are exactly the same as the collective fuzzy opiniona˜i, then the aggregate fuzzy opinion should be achieved the maximum agreement. Therefore, we construct the following multi-objective optimization model, which minimizes the sum of the Hamming distances between all individual fuzzy opinions and the collective fuzzy opinion for alternatives:(46)min{zi=∑t=1kd1(a˜i(t),a˜i)(i=1,2,…,m)}s.t.0≤ai≤bi≤ci≤di≤1(i=1,2,…,m)0≤μi≤1,0≤νi≤1,μi+νi≤1(i=1,2,…,m)Since there is no any preference between alternatives, the above multi-objective optimization model can be transformed into the single objective optimization model as follows:(47)min{z=∑i=1m∑t=1kd1(a˜i(t),a˜i)}s.t.sameastheconstraintsofEq.(46)By Eq. (27), the expressiond1(a˜i(t),a˜i)can be calculated as follows:(48)d1(a˜i(t),a˜i)=112(|(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(ai+2bi)μi|+|(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2ci+di)μi|+|(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(ai+2bi)(1−νi)|+|(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2ci+di)(1−νi)|).To solve Eq. (47), letd1i(t)+=12[|(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(ai+2bi)μi|+(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(ai+2bi)μi],d1i(t)−=12[|(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(ai+2bi)μi|−(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)+(ai+2bi)μi],d2i(t)+=12[|(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2ci+di)μi|+(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2ci+di)μi],d2i(t)−=12[|(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2ci+di)μi|−(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)+(2ci+di)μi],d3i(t)+=12[|(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(ai+2bi)(1−νi)|+(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(ai+2bi)(1−νi)],d3i(t)−=12[|(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(ai+2bi)(1−νi)|−(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))+(ai+2bi)(1−νi)],d4i(t)+=12[|(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2ci+di)(1−νi)|+(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2ci+di)(1−νi)],d4i(t)−=12[|(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2ci+di)(1−νi)|−(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))+(2ci+di)(1−νi)].Then, Eq. (47) can be transformed into the linear goal programming model as follows:(49)min{z=112∑l=14∑i=1m∑t=1k(dli(t)++dli(t)−)}s.t.(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(a′i+2b′i)−d1i(t)++d1i(t)−=0(t=1,2,…,k;i=1,2,…,m)(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2c′i+d′i)−d2i(t)++d2i(t)−=0(t=1,2,…,k;i=1,2,…,m)(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(a″i+2b″i)−d3i(t)++d3i(t)−=0(t=1,2,…,k;i=1,2,…,m)(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2c″i+d″i)−d4i(t)++d4i(t)−=0(t=1,2,…,k;i=1,2,…,m)0≤a′i≤b′i≤c′i≤d′i≤μi(i=1,2,…,m)0≤a″i≤b″i≤c″i≤d″i≤1−νi(i=1,2,…,m)0≤μi≤1,0≤νi≤1,μi+νi≤1(i=1,2,…,m)dli(t)+≥0,dli(t)−≥0,dli(t)+dli(t)−=0(t=1,2,…,k;i=1,2,…,m;l=1,2,3,4)where(50)a′i=aiμi,b′i=biμi,c′i=ciμi,d′i=diμia″i=ai(1−νi),b″i=bi(1−νi),c″i=ci(1−νi),d″i=di(1−νi)Solving Eq. (49) by the Simplex Method of linear programming,a′i,b′i,c′i,d′i,a″i,b″i,c″i,d″i,μi,νi(i=1,2,…,m)can be obtained. Therefore, by Eq. (50),ai,bi,ci,di,μi,νii.e., the collective overall attribute valuesa˜i=([ai,bi,ci,di];μi,νi)(i=1,2,…,m)are obtained.Remark 4The collective overall attribute values determined by Eqs. (47) and (49) do not reflected the relative importance assigned to the DMs for their fuzzy opinions. If the relative importance of each DM's opinion is to be taken into consideration in the aggregation process, Eq. (49) can be easily modified by incorporating the weight vector of DMs as follows:(51)min{z=112∑l=14∑i=1m∑t=1kλt(dli(t)++dli(t)−)}s.t.sameastheconstraintsofEq.(49)whereλ=(λ1,λ2,…,λk)Tis the weight vector of DMs, satisfying that0≤λt≤1(t=1,2,…,k)and∑t=1kλt=1.If the DM weight vectorλis changed, the change in the optimal solution of Eq. (51) could occur. Since Eq. (51) is a classical linear goal programming model, the change rangeΔλtof the weightλtof DM Ptthat leads to the change of optimal solution can be derived according to the post-optimality analysis theory of linear programming.If the attribute weight vectorWis changed in Eq. (45), the individual overall attribute values of alternatives may be changed which results in the change of the ranking result of alternatives. For alternatives Aiand Ak, ifAi≻Akis changed intoAi≺Akby changing the weight wjtowj+Δwj,0≤wj+Δwj≤1, then the change rangeΔwjcan be computed. However, it is very difficult to give the theoretical analysis since Eq. (45) is non-linear onW. In Section 5.1, we give a numerical example about this computation.Aimed at the four cases whether the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknown or known, the four methods for MAGDM with TrIFNs are respectively proposed.Method I for Case 1: the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknownStep 1: Normalize the decision matrixA˜(t)into matrixR˜(t)(t=1,2,…,k)according to Eqs. (39) and (40);Step 2: Calculate the individual overall attribute values of all the alternatives by Eq. (44);Step 3: Derive the collective overall attribute values of alternatives by solving Eq. (49);Step 4: Generate the ranking orders of alternatives according to collective overall attribute valuesa˜i(i=1,2,…,m)by the lexicographic ranking method developed in Section 2.3.Method II for Case 2: the weight vector of attributes is unknown and the weight vector of DMs is knownStep 1: Same as Step 1 of Method I;Step 2: Same as Step 2 of Method I;Step 3: Derive the collective overall attribute values of alternatives by solving Eq. (51);Step 4: Same as Step 4 of Method I.Method III for Case 3: the weight vector of attributes is known and the weight vector of DMs is unknownStep 1: Same as Step 1 of Method I;Step 2: Calculate the individual overall attribute values of all the alternatives by Eq. (45);Step 3: Same as Step 3 of Method I;Step 4: Same as Step 4 of Method I.Method IV for Case 4: the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are knownStep 1: Same as Step 1 of Method I;Step 2: Same as Step 2 of Method III;Step 3: Same as Step 3 of Method II;Step 4: Same as Step 4 of Method I.To facilitate the illustration and comparison, a green supplier selection problem is used to demonstrate the analysis process of the proposed methods in this paper. The comparison analyses with other similar methods are conducted in this section.Along with the quick development of economics, corporeal civilization has been elevated enormously. At the same time, the resource was reduced increasingly, and the environment that the human lived on faced threaten. Since the 1920s, the “green tidal wave” has risen all over the world. The green revolution that aimed at sustainable development was very flourishing and influenced various domains, including supply chain management. The green supply chain management was imperative under the situation. The green supply chain management can effectively bring tremendous economic benefit and strengthen competitive advantage for the enterprises.To protect the environment and achieve sustainable development of the social economy, Shanghai General Motors Company Limited (SGM for short) is desirable to select the most appropriate green supplier for one of the key elements in its manufacturing process. After pre-evaluation, four suppliers have remained as alternatives for further evaluation, including Howden Hua Engineering Company A1, Sino Trunk A2, Taikai Electric Group Company Limited A3 and Shantui construction machinery Company Limited A4. SGM employs four experts to form a group of DMs coming from four consultancy departments: DM P1 is from the production department; DM P2 is from the purchasing department; DM P3 is from the quality inspection department; DM P4 is from the engineering department.The attributes for evaluating suppliers are important because they obviously influence the selection result. In this example study, through discussion with other researchers and practitioners, redundant factors are eliminated and similar ones are combined. Utilizing the principal component analysis, the group of DMs chooses four independent attributes (i.e., principal components) since the cumulative variance contribution rates of these four principal components is 81.94%. These four attributes become the evaluation attributes for this example, including the product quality a1, technology capability a2, pollution control a3 and environment management a4. The DM Pt(t=1, 2, 3, 4) represents the characteristics of the potential green suppliers of Ai(i=1, 2, 3, 4) on the attributes of aj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) by the form of TrIFNs, listed in Tables 1–4.For example, the first TrIFN ([6, 7, 8, 9]; 0.6, 0.2) in Table 1 means that the most possible value of alternative A1 on attribute a1 given by DM P1 is between interval [7, 8] with the maximum membership degree 0.6, the minimum non-membership degree 0.2, and the hesitation degree 0.2, the lower limit is 6 and the upper limit is 9. The assessment value TrIFN ([6, 7, 8, 9]; 0.6, 0.2) can be obtained by the following pre-processing phase:(1)After negotiation and discussion, the group of DMs all agrees that the assessments on attribute a1 should use trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in 10-point scale (grades from 0 up to 10 are used in endpoints of mode, lower and upper limits, with 0 being worst and 10 being best) to score.Each DM respectively gives the lower mark a, the upper mark d and the most possible mark interval [b, c] (i.e., mode) for alternative A1 on attribute a1.Meanwhile, for the most possible mark interval, each DM provides the maximum membership degreewa˜and the minimum non-membership degreeua˜according to his/her knowledge and experience or by statistical methods. Thus, TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)is produced.The other TrIFNs in Tables 1–4 can be similarly explained and obtained.In what follows, we use respectively the four methods proposed in this paper to solve this example. For Case 1, the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknown, the detail computation process of Method I is elaborated below.Step 1: Using Eq. (39), the normalized decision matrixes are obtained and listed in Tables 5–8.Step 2: Take the alternative A1 for DM P1 as an example, the similarity matrix for the attribute valuer˜1k(1)(k=1,2,3,4)is computed by Eq. (41) as follows:S11=10.7450.7750.9250.74510.90.820.7750.910.850.9250.820.851.The average similarity degrees ofr˜1k(1)(k=1,2,3,4)are computed by Eq. (42) asAS(r˜11(1))=0.9511,AS(r˜12(1))=0.9222,AS(r˜13(1))=0.9222,AS(r˜14(1))=0.9489.The support degrees of attribute valuesr˜1k(1)(k=1,2,3,4)are computed by Eq. (43) as follows:T(r˜11(1))=0.2438,T(r˜12(1))=0.2458,T(r˜13(1))=0.2517,T(r˜14(1))=0.2587.Thus, the weights(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1m(1+T(a˜k))of attribute valuer˜1k(1)(k=1,2,3,4)for the TrIFPG operator are obtained as1+T(r˜11(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜1k(1)))=0.2488,1+T(r˜12(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜1k(1)))=0.2492,1+T(r˜13(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜1k(1)))=0.2503,1+T(r˜14(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜1k(1)))=0.2517.The individual overall attribute value of alternative A1 given by DM P1 is derived by Eq. (44) asa˜1(1)=([a1(1),b1(1),c1(1),d1(1)];μ1(1),ν1(1))=TrIFPG(r˜11(1),r˜12(1),r˜13(1),r˜14(1))=([0.4823,0.5858,0.6882,0.8135];0.3,0.4).Analogously, the individual overall attribute values of alternatives are obtained, i.e.,a˜2(1)=([0.5134,0.6391,0.7699,0.8703];0.4,0.6),a˜3(1)=([0.3456,0.4857,0.5877,0.7165];0.4,0.3),a˜4(1)=([0.2780,0.3933,0.5631,0.6650];0.2,0.4),a˜1(2)=([0.1415,0.3938,0.5183,0.6623];0.5,0.4),a˜2(2)=([0.3133,0.5183,0.6929,0.8650];0.5,0.3),a˜3(2)([0.1416,0.2831,0.5057,0.7535];0.6,0.4),a˜4(2)=([0.1190,0.2448,0.3934,0.5914];0.5,0.3),a˜1(3)=([0.2039,0.3785,0.5547,0.6574];0.4,0.3),a˜2(3)=([0.3935,0.5691,0.6699,0.8239];0.3,0.3),a˜3(3)=([0.2116,0.3335,0.5978,0.7254];0.5,0.3),a˜4(3)=([0.1409,0.2778,0.4206,0.5724];0.4,0.3),a˜1(4)=([0.4229,0.5693,0.6965,0.8427];0.3,0.6),a˜2(4)=([0.4729,0.5733,0.7238,0.8485];0.3,0.6),a˜3(4)=([0.2451,0.4473,0.5478,0.7446];0.4,0.3),a˜4(4)=([0.2348,0.3947,0.5642,0.6968];0.4,0.3).Step 3: According to Eq. (49), the following linear goal programming model can be obtained:(52)min{z=112∑l=14∑i=14∑t=14(dli(t)++dli(t)−)}s.t.(ai(t)+2bi(t))μi(t)−(a′i+2b′i)−d1i(t)++d1i(t)−=0(t=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,4)(2ci(t)+di(t))μi(t)−(2c′i+d′i)−d2i(t)++d2i(t)−=0(t=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,4)(ai(t)+2bi(t))(1−νi(t))−(a″i+2b″i)−d3i(t)++d3i(t)−=0(t=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,4)(2ci(t)+di(t))(1−νi(t))−(2c″i+d″i)−d4i(t)++d4i(t)−=0(t=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,4)0≤a′i≤b′i≤c′i≤d′i≤μi(i=1,2,3,4)0≤a″i≤b″i≤c″i≤d″i≤1−νi(i=1,2,3,4)0≤μi≤1,0≤νi≤1,μi+νi≤1(i=1,2,3,4)dli(t)+≥0,dli(t)−≥0,dli(t)+dli(t)−=0(t=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,4;l=1,2,3,4)By solving Eq. (52), we obtain the collective overall attribute values of alternatives as follows:a˜1=([0.2033,0.2334,0.2334,0.5526];0.6933,0),a˜2=([0.2322,0.2422,0.2422,0.8759];0.7087,0),a˜3=([0.2336,0.2571,0.2571,0.8102];0.6097,0),a˜4=([0.1625,0.1625,0.1625,0.7497];0.6242,0).Step 4: By Eqs. (19) and (20), the weighted possibility means for the collective overall attribute values of alternatives are respectively calculated, i.e.,mμ(a˜1)=0.1952,mμ(a˜2)=0.2453,mμ(a˜3)=0.2106,mμ(a˜4)=0.1625,mν(a˜1)=0.2816,mν(a˜2)=0.3462,mν(a˜3)=0.3453,mν(a˜4)=0.2604.Sincemμ(a˜2)>mμ(a˜3)>mμ(a˜1)>mμ(a˜4), the ranking order isA2≻A3≻A1≻A4, the best selection is the supplier Sino Trunk A2. As the biggest base of China national heavy duty truck, Sino Trunk A2 has the obvious advantage of technology and market. Its products are popular in domestic and foreign market. Moreover, SGM has already accumulated some experience of cooperation with Sino Trunk in recent years. Therefore, Sino Trunk A2 is the wise selection for SGM, which is consistent with the real-life situation of SGM.Similarly, we give the computation results and ranking for the four methods shown in Table 9.Table 9 shows that different methods may lead to different decisions and different weights of attributes and DMs also results in different ranking results. In real application, SGM can suitably select one of the four methods to make decision according to the real-life need and situation of the company. From the robustness viewpoint, Method I is the best since it need not the weight information of attributes and DMs. As far as this example and Method III are concerned, the change ranges of attribute weightw1that lead to the change fromA2≻A3toA2≺A3is calculated asΔw1∈[−0.1102,0.02141]. As far as this example and Method II are concerned, the change ranges of the DM weights that leads to the change of optimal solution of Eq. (51) is derived as follows:Δλ1∈[−0.0073,0.0293],Δλ2∈[−0.1033,0.01976],Δλ3∈[−0.0004,0.01441],Δλ4∈[−0.0602,0.0203].Wu and Cao [33] assumed that the weight vector of attributes isw=(0.22,0.20,0.28,0.30)Tand the weight vector of DMs isλ=(0.2,0.3,0.15,0.35)T. They used the TrIFNs weighted geometric (TrIFWG) operator and hybrid geometric (TrIFHG) operator to obtain the collective overall values and then calculated the distances between collective overall values and positive-ideal solution as follows:d(r˜1,r+)=0.207,d(r˜2,r+)=0.144,d(r˜3,r+)=0.218,d(r˜4,r+)=0.264.Then, the ranking order obtained by [33] isA2≻A1≻A3≻A4, which is different from the rankingA2≻A3≻A1≻A4that obtained by Method IV in this paper. Compared Wu and Cao [33] with this paper, the latter has the following advantages:(a)The former is only suitable for the case where the weights of attributes and DMs are known and cannot solve the MAGDM with unknown weights of attributes and DMs, whereas the latter proposes four methods which can solve four cases whether the weight vectors of attributes and DMs are unknown or known. This implies that the latter has wider real application range than the former.It shows from Tables 1–4 that there are too large TrIFNa˜21(1)=([7,8,9,10];0.7,0.3)for A2 in Table 1 and too small TrIFN ([1, 2, 3, 4]; 0.4, 0.1) for A4 in Table 3, which results in the ranking orderA2≻A1≻A3≻A4by the former. The TrIFWG and TrIFHG operators developed in the former cannot relieve the influence of unfair data (too large or too small TrIFNs). Whereas, the latter uses the TrIFPG or TrIFWPG operator to obtain the individual overall attribute values of alternatives and then derives the collective ones through constructing the goal programming model. The power geometric operators of TrIFNs assign the associated weights by using the support measure, which can effectively relieve the influence of unfair data on the fusion results by assigning low weights to those unfair ones.For instance, the weights(1+T(a˜k))/∑k=1m(1+T(a˜k))of attribute valuesr˜2k(1)(k=1,2,3,4)for the TrIFPG operator are respectively obtained as follows:1+T(r˜21(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜2k(1)))=0.5136,1+T(r˜22(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜2k(1)))=0.6393,1+T(r˜23(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜2k(1)))=0.7700,1+T(r˜24(1))∑k=14(1+T(r˜2k(1)))=0.8705.Hence, though the attribute valuea˜21(1)=([7,8,9,10];0.7,0.3)for A2 is the maximum, its weight 0.5136 is the minimum among the above four weights. The analysis implies that the power geometric operators of TrIFNs can assign low weights to those unfair ones to relive the influence of unfair data on the fusion results indeed. By contrast, the TrIFWG and TrIFHG operators developed by the former have no this prominent characteristic.The ranking method of TrIFNs adapted in the former came from [31], which merely calculated the distance between the TrIFNs and positive ideal solution. Such a ranking method of TrIFNs is a single-index approach, which is not always feasible and effective. The latter utilizes the weighted possibility means to develop a new lexicographic ranking method of TrIFNs. This ranking method is a two-index approach and more reasonable than that of the former since the latter takes into consideration not only the weighted possibility means of the membership functions, but also the weighted possibility means of non-membership functions of TrIFNs.Through deleting the corresponding trapezoidal fuzzy numbers[h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)]of TrIFNsa˜ij(t)=([h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)];μij(t),νij(t))in Tables 1–4, the TrIFNsa˜ij(t)=([h1ij(t),h2ij(t),h3ij(t),h4ij(t)];μij(t),νij(t))become IFSsa˜ij(t)=(μij(t),νij(t)). Then the above green supplier selection example is reduced to MAGDM with IFSs. Xu [5] utilized the IF power weighted geometric (IFPWG) operator and IF weighted geometric (IFWG) operator to develop Approach I to MAGDM with IFSs. We apply Approach I proposed in [5] to solve this MAGDM with IFSs. Assume that the weight vector of attributes isw=(0.22,0.20,0.28,0.30)Tand the weight vector of DMs isλ=(0.2,0.3,0.15,0.35)T, respectively. After computation, the overall preference values of alternatives are obtained asr1=(0.5099,0.2989),r2=(0.6238,0.2483),r3=(0.5176,0.2280),r4=(0.4487,0.3688).The scores of ri(i=1,2,3,4)are respectively calculated asSr1=0.2110,Sr2=0.3755,Sr3=0.2896,Sr4=0.0799. SinceSr2>Sr3>Sr1>Sr4, the ranking order obtained by [5] isA2≻A3≻A1≻A4, which is the same as that obtained by Method IV in this paper. This observation verifies the effectiveness of the Method IV proposed in this paper. Nevertheless there are some advantages of this paper over Xu [5]:(1)This paper studies the power geometric aggregation operators for TrIFNs, while Xu [5] studies the ones for IFSs. Since TrIFNs are added by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers on the basis of IFSs, TrIFNs may better reflect the assessment information and greatly enhance the representation ability of information than IFSs. For a TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜), ifa=b=c=d, then the TrIFNa˜=([a,b,c,d];wa˜,ua˜)reduces to IFSa˜=(wa˜,ua˜). Thus, the power geometric aggregation operators for TrIFNs developed in this paper reduce to the ones for IFSs developed by Xu [5]. Therefore, the former generalizes the latter and the latter may be viewed as a special case of the former. The proposed methods in this paper can solve MAGDM with IFSs or TrIFNs, whereas the method [5] cannot solve MAGDM with TrIFNs.The method [5] is only applicable to the MAGDM with IFSs and known weights of attributes and DMs and is not valid for other three cases, whereas this paper proposes four methods which can be used to solve all kinds of cases.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
As a special case of IFSs, TrIFNs are the suitable tools to express the uncertain and fuzzy quantities with hesitance degrees. This paper proposes four methods for MAGDM with TrIFNs. First, the weighted possibility means of TrIFNs are defined. A new lexicographic method based on the weighted possibility means is developed to rank the TrIFNs. The Minkowski distance for TrIFNs is also defined. Hereby, four kinds of power geometric operators of TrIFNs are investigated including the TrIFPG, TrIFPWG, TrIFPOWG and TrIFPHG operators, and their desirable properties are also discussed in details. Applying the TrIFPG operator or TrIFPWG operator, the individual overall attribute values of alternatives are obtained. Then, the collective overall attribute values of alternatives are derived through constructing the multi-objective optimization model, which is transformed into the goal programming model to solve. Thus, the ranking order of alternatives is generated according to the collective overall attribute values of alternatives.The notable characteristics of the developed power geometric operators of TrIFNs are that they not only sufficiently take into account the relationships among the arguments being aggregated by allowing values being aggregated to support and reinforce each other, but also measure the similarity degrees of the arguments and can reduce the influence of those unduly high or unduly low arguments on the decision result by assigning lower weights to those outliers. The constructed multi-objective optimization model, which minimizes the sum of the Hamming distances between all individual fuzzy opinions and the collective fuzzy opinion for alternatives, can make the group opinion more unanimous. It is shown from aspects of theory analysis and specific application that the proposed decision methods in this paper can deal with the situations where the weights of attribute and DMS are known or unknown. Therefore, the proposed methods in this paper are of university and practicability.Though the green supplier selection example is used to illustrate the application and validation of the proposed methods, the proposed methods are very suitable for the decision making problems in many areas, especially in situations where the problems involve multiple different attributes with different dimensions and some unfair assessment data. It is expected to be applicable to the water resource assessment, risk investment, performance evaluation of military system, engineering management, etc. How to conduct the theoretical analysis on the influence of attribute and DM weights on the ranking result is an interesting issue which will be further investigated in near future.
