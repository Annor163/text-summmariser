The movement of a vehicle is much affected by surrounding environments such as road shapes and other traffic participants. This paper proposes a new vehicle motion prediction method to predict future motion of an on-road vehicle which is observed by a stereo camera system mounted on a moving vehicle. Our proposed algorithm considers not only the history movement of the observed vehicle, but also the environment configuration around the vehicle. To find feasible paths under a dynamic road environment, the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is used. A simulation based method is then applied to generate future trajectories by combining results from RRT and a motion prediction algorithm modelled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our experiments show that our approach can predict future motion of a vehicle accurately, and outperforms previous works where only motion history is considered for motion prediction.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Being able to predict the future motions of vehicles is important especially in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) [1] and autonomous car systems [2]. Unique in a vehicle system, the motions of vehicles are constrained by a road network, steering geometry as well as their momentum in speed. Using the information as constraints, we are able to predict the future motions of a vehicle.In current state-of-the-art technologies in vehicle motion prediction, a number of algorithms have been developed to predict the motions of vehicles captured by surveillance cameras in a static environment [3]. Besides, more and more researches are interested in predicting the motions of vehicles under dynamic environment where input video is captured by a car-mounted camera on a moving car [2,4]. By predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles around a moving car, better safety precaution can be installed in the ADAS and autonomous car.In this paper, we propose a motion planning based algorithm to predict the motion of a vehicle observed by a stereo camera rig mounted on a moving vehicle under dynamic environments. In particular, the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) [5] is applied to incrementally sample the future motion of the observed vehicle based on its motion history and road configuration. Different from conventional RRT where the objective is just to find routes to a goal, we use the routes as reference paths to simulate future movement. This allows us to achieve a more accurate motion prediction, and a longer range of prediction.In our setting, we use road networks from the Open Street Map (OSM) [6] to set possible goal points for RRT. In addition, we use the satellite map from the Google Earth [7] to configure road environments that include information about boundaries and lanes of roads. To detect and localize positions of vehicles by the camera system, we use the Deformable Part Model detector [8]. Since our focus is to predict the future motion of a vehicle, we assume the information about the road network and the surrounding environment is accurate.We tested our algorithm using real road data sequences from the KITTI vision benchmark suite data set [9] with ground truth evaluation to estimate prediction accuracy. We have also compared our results with prior methods for vehicle motion prediction. The results show that using motion planning helps to enhance accuracy of prediction of future trajectories.The remainder of this paper follows this outline. Section 2 reviews related works in vehicle motion prediction and motion planning. Section 3 defines our problem. Section 4 describes the configuration of our environment data. Section 5 presents our method to model motion history. Section 6 details our proposed motion prediction algorithm. Section 7 evaluates the performance of our algorithm. Finally, our paper is concluded in Section 8.
