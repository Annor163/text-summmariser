@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work presents a finite strain quadrilateral element with least-squares assumed in-plane shear strains (in covariant/contravariant coordinates) and classical transverse shear assumed strains. It is an alternative to enhanced-assumed-strain (EAS) formulation and, in contrast to this, produces an element satisfying ab initio the Patch-test. No additional degrees-of-freedom are present, unlike EAS. Least-squares fit allows the derivation of invariant finite strain elements which are both in-plane and out-of-plane shear-locking free and amenable to standardization in commercial codes. With that goal, we use automatically generated code produced by AceGen and Mathematica to obtain novel finite element formulations. The corresponding exact linearization of the internal forces was, until recently, a insurmountable task. We use the tangent modulus in the least-squares fit to ensure that stress modes are obtained from a five-parameter strain fitting. This reproduces exactly the in-plane bending modes. The discrete equations are obtained by establishing a four-field variational principle (a direct extension of the Hu–Washizu variational principle). The main achieved goal is coarse-mesh accuracy for distorted meshes, which is adequate for being used in crack propagation problems. In addition, as an alternative to spherical interpolation, a consistent director normalization is performed. Metric components are fully deduced and exact linearization of the shell element is performed. Full linear and nonlinear assessment of the element is performed, showing similar performance to more costly approaches, often on-par with the best available shell elements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Finite strain plasticity and fracture simulations with finite elements (cf. [8,10]) are peculiarly demanding with respect to numerical efficiency, Newton iteration robustness and mesh distortion insensitivity. This is relevant in the edge-based algorithms recently proposed [12] when applied to quadrilaterals. Many of the intricate element formulations, such as enhanced-assumed-strain, hybrid stress, discrete Kirchhoff (DK, cf. [14]), are suitable for smooth problems where the mesh distortion sensitivity is not a crucial factor and governing equations do not contain discontinuities. In addition, costs associated with convergence difficulties and static condensation (specifically with EAS) can also be high. We take a different approach here: starting with a mixed 4-field functional (displacement field, director field, components of the local Cauchy–Green tensor and the corresponding stress-like Lagrange multipliers), we discretize the resulting Euler–Lagrange equations making use of suitable shape functions. A complete testing program is then performed. The set of obstacle problems for shells are the classical plate and shell benchmarks and extensions to finite strains. Testing elements in finite strains is also important since some instabilities have been found in the past (see [22] for a report with the Morley-based shell). Element technology for quadrilaterals is too vast to be accounted in a single article and many elements proposed in the last three decades vary only slightly in performance for the same number of degrees-of-freedom. Some important works must be mentioned. A milestone in the removal of transverse shear locking was achieved with the assumed natural strain (ANS) technique in 1984 and 1986 [24,36]. A decade earlier, in-plane bending locking was solved in 1973 by the Wilson Q6 element [51], with several ulterior corrections. For undistorted meshes, convergence rate of the results is established regardless of the incomplete higher order terms in the polynomials (see the book by Belytschko and co-workers [17]) and these higher order terms only contribute to stability and coarse-mesh accuracy. Of course, mesh distortion adversely affects the convergence rate (Lee and Bathe [31] proved the reduction of order of convergence) and it has been a problem with only a few published solution proposals, see also [7]. If the element geometry is a square or a rectangle, the present approach for in-plane bending is equivalent to the Q6 formulation. For out-of-plane shear, we adopt a consistent version of ANS. Selective integration for transverse strains has some advantages but two nearly zero-energy modes (often called spurious modes) appear in low-order symmetric quadrilateral plate elements in that case – these are known as w-hourglass and in-plane twist. We therefore describe the technique in the following sections. After this, both linear (four plates and four shells) and nonlinear tests(three geometrically nonlinear and two finite strain plasticity) are performed with a high degree of accuracy and mesh distortion insensitivity. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7.Cauchy equations of equilibrium for an arbitrary reference configuration are obtained from the corresponding spatial equilibrium (derivations for the latter are shown in Ogden [35]). Using standard notation (cf. [35,48]) we write the spatial equilibrium equations as(1)∂σij∂xpj+bi=0with the Cauchy tensor components σij(i,j=1,2,3). In (1)i is the direction index and j is the facet index. The components of the body force vector are bi. In (1), coordinatesxpjare the spatial, or deformed, coordinates of a given point (identified by p) under consideration. It is assumed that (1) is satisfied for a time parametert∈[0,T]with T being the total time of observation and for a point with positionxp∈Ωtbelonging to the deformed position domain at the time of analysis. In tensor notation, Eq. (1) can be presented as(2)∇·σT+b=0with∇=∂/∂xpis the gradient operator. Making use of the deformation gradientFand the JacobianJ=detF, a direct manipulation of (1) with the use of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress,S=JF−1σF−Tleads to(3)∇0·(FS)T+Jb=0where ∇0 is the gradient operator with respect to the material coordinatesxp, (∇0=∂/∂xp0). A generalization results in(4)∇b·(FbSb)T+Jbb=0where(5)∇b=∂∂xpb(6)Fb=∇b·x(7)Jb=detFb(8)Sb=JbFb−1σFb−TConsidering a time instance tawe can re-write (4) as(9)∇b·(FabSab)T+Jabb=0withFab=∇b·xpa,SabT=Sabandta≥tb.Adopting (9) as the equilibrium equation with time parameters taand tb, stress integration can be used in a form that avoids the polar decomposition or (explicit) objective rates. The resulting derivation can be used to achieve an efficient and robust time-integration scheme for finite plastic strains. Consider three configurations Ωa, Ωband Ωc(respectively at timesta≥tb≥tc). The relative deformation gradient between two configurations Ωaand Ωbis given by11Scalar components ofFabare introduced as[Fab]ijfor the element in the ith row and jth column.(10)Fab=∂xpa∂xpbor, using the covariant basis (cf. [13]), the following product is obtained:(11)Fab=xaybwhere(12)xa=∂xpa∂ξcontains the covariant basis vectors of configuration Ωa. Curvilinear coordinatesξ, used in (12), are chosen as a matter of convenience. In addition,ya=xa−1contains the contravariant basis vectors of the same configuration. The inverse of the deformation gradient is obtained by swapping indices a and b:Fab−1=Fba. Usingxa, the spatial covariant metric is defined as(13)maa=xaTxaUsing the spatial metric we can write the right Cauchy–Green tensor (see [35] for the nomenclature) between two configurations Ωaand Ωbfrom its definition (11) as(14)Cab=ybTmaaybStress tensors are also naturally given in relation to two configurations Ωaand Ωb. Obviously, power-conjugate quantities involving a definition of stressSabbetween two configurations must be of the form:(15)ẇ=12Sab:Ċab∀ta≥tb. The weak form of equilibrium is given by (the upper triangle indicates a “virtual quantity”, as employed by Antman [2])(16)12∫ΩbSab:C▵abdΩb︸W▵int=W▵extThe so-called “stress updates” in the sense of approximations for the Lie derivative (see Chapters 7 and 8 of [45]) are given as(17)Sab=ΔSˇab+1JbcFbcSbcFbcT︸SbbwithΔSˇabbeing the relative constitutive stress22Both elastic and inelastic parts contribute toΔSˇab.andSbbthe “transported” stress, whose origin is kinematic. The sequence of reference configurations isΩc→Ωb→Ωa. Linearization of (16) is straightforward (with fewer operations at the constitutive level than the traditional Kirchhoff-stress/strain rate approach) and follows:(18)dW▵int=12∫ΩbSab:dC▵abdΩb+14∫ΩbdCab:C:C▵abdΩbThe interesting versatility of the present approach is that for hyperelastic materials we can coalesceΩb≡Ωc=Ω0and the Lagrangian description of hyperelasticity can be used without specific conditions and for arbitrarily large strains. Hence, the choice in terms of material modeling is one of the following for Eq. (17):•Ωc≡Ωb≡Ω0and classical strain energy density functions for consistent hyperelasticity (including anisotropic models).Ωc≠Ω0andΩb≠Ω0,Fab≠Iand stress integration for isotropic hypoelasticity/general plasticity in fixed frames.Ωc≠Ω0andΩb≠Ω0,Fab=Iand stress integration for isotropic hypoelasticity/general plasticity in moving or corotational frames.We note that, at this point, all tensors are defined in orthonormal bases, and particularly both Green–Lagrange strain (20) and stress (17) updates are valid in orthonormal bases.Shells constrain the metric, as described in the classical work of Antman and Marlow [3], resulting in a specific form of the position vector. For a shell, it is known that a possiblexpa∈Ωais the following:(21)xpa=rpa+Haξ32dpawhererpais the mid-surface position vector in configuration Ωa, ξ3 is a non-dimensional, thickness-like coordinate, Hais the thickness at positionrpaand, finally,dpais a unit director. We use H to represent the undeformed thickness (in configuration Ω0). This nomenclature is standard and is adopted in [13]. Fordpawe use 3 rotation parameters,β1,β2,β3and determine the directordpausing the following product:(22)dpa=T(β1,β2,β3)dpbwhereT(β1,β2,β3)is a rotation matrix anddpbis the director in configuration Ωb. The rotation matrixT(β1,β2,β3)is given by Rodrigues formula (cf. [39]):(23)T(β1,β2,β3)=I+sinββW(β)+2sin2(β2)β2W2(β)whereβ=∥β∥is the Euclidean norm of{β1,β2,β3}andW(β)is the following skew-symmetric matrix:(24)W(β)=[0−β3β2β30−β1−β2β10]First and second derivatives ofT(β1,β2,β3)are determined using the software Wolfram Mathematica [40] with the add-on AceGen [30]. We use three rotation parameters and therefore the drilling rotation is prescribed to zero using zero-pivot treatment [11]. Sincedpais a unit vector, the propertydpa·∂dpa/∂ξi=0for i=1,2 results in the following covariant metric components:(25)[maa]ij=rpai·rpaj+Haξ32[(rpai·dpaj+rpaj·dpai)+Haξ32dpai·dpaj](26)[maa]i3=κsHa2rpai·dpa(27)[maa]33=Ha24with i=1,2 and j=1,2. In (25), we considerrpaias the derivative ofrpawith respect to ξi. Finally, κsis the shear correction parameter, taken here as 5/6, which scales the shear terms so that the correct shear energy is obtained. After the determination ofmaafrom relations (25)–(27), a compatibleCabis calculated using the definition:(28)Cab=ybTmaaybOf course, if fixed non-orthogonal (but normed) coordinates are used, four versions can be determined (covariant/covariant, contravariant/contravariant, contravariant/covariant and covariant/contravariant), the latter being used here and identified asCab⋆:(29)Cab⋆=x¯bTCaby¯bTwhere the line over a quantity indicates an evaluation at the element׳s center coordinates (i.e.x¯b≡xb|ξ→0andy¯b≡yb|ξ→0). As in Simo and Armero [43] and Pian and Sumihara [37], fixed non-orthogonal coordinates are used to:•Extend the notion of “bending modes” of a rectangle to a general quadrilateral.Ensure the satisfaction of the Patch-test for distorted geometries.Cabis written in a orthonormal global frame,Cab⋆is written in a non-orthogonal local element frame,Cab′is written in a orthogonal local element frame.The rationale for using this transformation is the extension of assumed-strain formulations to non-regular quadrilaterals. For notation convenience, Voigt form is used. In this case, we can write the Voigt form of strain (using upright bold notation) as(31)Eab⋆=TE⋆(x¯b,y¯b)EabwhereTE⋆(x¯b,y¯b)is the 6×6 matrix resulting from the use of Voigt form for the transformation (29):(32)TE⋆(x¯b,y¯b)=[x¯11by¯11bx¯21by¯12bx¯31by¯13bx¯12by¯21bx¯22by¯22bx¯32by¯23bx¯13by¯31bx¯23by¯32bx¯33by¯33b2x¯11by¯21b2x¯21by¯22b2x¯31by¯23b2x¯11by¯31b2x¯21by¯32b2x¯31by¯33b2x¯12by¯31b2x¯22by¯32b2x¯32by¯33b||12(x¯21by¯11b+x¯11by¯12b)12(x¯31by¯11b+x¯11by¯13b)12(x¯31by¯12b+x¯12by¯13b)12(x¯22by¯21b+x¯12by¯22b)12(x¯32by¯21b+x¯12by¯23b)12(x¯32by¯22b+x¯22by¯23b)12(x¯23by¯31b+x¯13by¯32b)12(x¯33by¯31b+x¯13by¯33b)12(x¯33by¯32b+x¯23by¯33b)x¯21by¯21b+x¯11by¯22bx¯31by¯21b+x¯11by¯23bx¯31by¯22b+x¯21by¯23bx¯21by¯31b+x¯11by¯32bx¯31by¯31b+x¯11by¯33bx¯31by¯32b+x¯21by¯33bx¯22by¯31b+x¯12by¯32bx¯32by¯31b+x¯12by¯33bx¯32by¯32b+x¯22by¯33b]The following convention is adopted to convert from matrix to Voigt representation:(33)Eab⋆=Voigt(Eab⋆)(34)Eab=Voigt(Eab)A local orthogonal frame is also used, which is adopted to impose directly the zero normal stress condition for a stress component. In that case, we introduce an orthogonal tensorRwith the purpose of transforming the stress in Voigt form such that(35)Sab′=TS(R)Sabwhere(36)TS(R)=[R112R212R3122R21R112R31R112R31R21R122R222R3222R22R122R32R122R32R22R132R232R3322R23R132R33R132R33R23R11R12R21R22R31R32R21R12+R11R22R31R12+R11R32R31R22+R21R32R11R13R21R23R31R33R21R13+R11R23R31R13+R11R33R31R23+R21R33R12R13R22R23R32R33R22R13+R12R23R32R13+R12R33R32R23+R22R33]andCab′=TE(R)CabwhereTE(R)=TST(RT). It is trivial to switch between the prime and unprimed quantities and therefore we do not detail further this topic. TensorRis introduced to obtain a lamina coordinate system (see, e.g. [28]). Note that transformation (35) is necessary to correctly write the constitutive equations in a orthogonal and normed frame. The requirement of this frame emerges from the zero normal stress condition. Note that bothCab′andSab′are defined in a local orthonormal frame.For conciseness of notation, we temporarily omit the subscripts a and b (which are related to the configurations Ωaand Ωb, respectively). A mixed formulation for conservative problems is now introduced to derive the weak form of equilibrium from a total potential with Lagrange multiplier terms to impose the constraints (cf. [46,43]). Voigt convention for symmetric tensors is adopted and we temporarily assume, for simplicity, that all strain components follow the same interpolation scheme. Coordinate transformations are also not considered at this point. If we introduce an independent Green–Lagrange strainE˜, a corresponding Lagrange multiplier is required to enforce the weak equality betweenEandE˜. The consistent approach to the mixed interpolation for the conservative case is given by the following total potential:(37)Π({u,d},E˜,S)=∫Ωbψ[E˜]dΩb+∫ΩbST(E−E˜)dΩb−Wext(u,d)where ψ is the strain energy density function (cf. [35]), in this case a function of the independent strain increment.Wextis the external work for conservative forces. In (37),uanddare the displacement and director fields, respectively, grouped as a pair{u,d}. In (37), the componentsSare the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the constraintsE−E˜=0and also represent mixed second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses. For conciseness reasons, we temporarily assume that all components of the relative strainE˜are independent, not detracting from the aimed generality. The stationarity condition of (37) with respect toS,E˜andEresults in the following three equations:(38)∫Ωb(E−E˜)TS▵dΩb=0(39)∫Ωb(∂ψ[E˜]∂E˜−S)TE˜▵dΩb=0(40)∫ΩbSTE▵dΩb=W▵extEqs. (38)–(40) are used as a basis for assumed-strain methods. UsingS˜=∂ψ[E˜]/∂E˜, we now introduce a linear relation betweenSandS˜as(41)S=QM−1∫ΩbQTS˜dΩbwhereQis a function of the spatial coordinates. MatrixMin (41) is given by(42)M=∫ΩbQTQdΩbEnergy-conjugacy∫ΩbSTE▵dΩb=∫ΩbS˜TE˜▵dΩbthen allows the determination ofE˜▵as(43)E˜▵=QM−1∫ΩbQTE▵dΩbNote that (43), which has the form of a least-squares result, can also be obtained by using a weighed least-squares approach with the interpolation matrixQ. By inserting (41) into (40), we can write the energy conjugacy condition (previously alluded) as(44)∫ΩbSiE▵idΩb=∫Ωb[E▵iQijMjk−1(∫ΩbQlkS˜ldΩb)]dΩb(45)∫ΩbSiE▵idΩb=∫ΩbS˜iE˜▵idΩbEq. (40) then becomes(46)∫ΩbS˜TE˜▵dΩb=W▵extAs for Eq. (38), it is trivially satisfied from (41) and (43). The same occurs with (39) as a consequence of using the assumed form ofSandE˜. Of course, if a non-conservative problem is solved, the form (46) can still be applied originating from the principle of virtual power (e.g. [2]). Note that we can write Eq. (43) as the result of a least square calculation (see Appendix).A discretization of the Euler–Lagrange equations for one element (superscript e) makes use of the following interpolations:(47)ue=NuuN(48)de=NddN∥NddN∥2The specific forms forNu,Ndare standard:(49)Nu(ξ1,ξ2)=[⋯NK(ξ1,ξ2)00⋯⋯0NK(ξ1,ξ2)0⋯⋯00NK(ξ1,ξ2)⋯]3×12(50)Nd(ξ1,ξ2)=[⋯NK(ξ1,ξ2)00⋯⋯0NK(ξ1,ξ2)0⋯⋯00NK(ξ1,ξ2)⋯]3×12with scalar shape functions given by(51)NK(ξ1,ξ2)=14(1+ξ1Kξ1)(1+ξ2Kξ2)where uppercase indices such as K are used for nodal quantities (in agreement with the notation of Belytschko and co-workers, cf. [17]). Note that, in (48), normalization is required to ensure correctness in the metric coefficients. To clarify our approach we partition the assumed strains in two terms: one for the out-of-plane strain obtained from ANS (here with notationE˜Ie) and another in-plane least-squares interpolation(herewithnotationE˜IIe):(52)E˜e=E˜Ie+E˜IIewith the corresponding rotated version (cf. 35) being given as(53)E˜e′=TE(R)E˜eIn terms of transverse shear metric components, we have the modified MITC4 interpolation (cf.

Fig. 2shows the relevant data and results. Excellent performance is obtained with the covariant/contravariant transformation. Note that the performance is on-par with EAS elements [43]. We further confirm the superiority of our covariant/contravariant frame decision in mesh-distortion tests in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. The problem of frame use in bending with distorted quadrilaterals has been studied in depth by Felippa [26] and optimality has been proved for Pian–Sumihara style elements. Our results in the two-element test coincide with the ones of Pian–Sumihara (see also [26] for some comparisons).We have proposed a general integration algorithm for finite plastic strains with multiple yield functions in [6]. Kinematic hardening and plastic anisotropy were considered in that paper, but for the present work we limit the analysis to classical isotropic hardening. With that purpose, we replace, by means of the Chen–Mangasarian [19] function, the classical complementarity conditions by a single smooth equation. We retain the nSsimultaneously active yield functions. For unconstrained problems (i.e. classical plane strain or three-dimensional continua) with nSyield surfaces, the elasto-plastic constitutive system in Voigt form is given as(62)Clinear−1ΔSˇab−Eab+mn(ΔSˇab,Δγ)Δγ=0(63)μ⋆Δγ−〈μ⋆Δγ+ϕ(ΔSˇab)〉︸φc(ΔSˇab,Δγ)=0(64)Δv=−∑i=1nsΔγiψiwhere, in (62),Clinearis the Hookean matrix,ΔSˇabis the constitutive stress correction,nis the matrix of flow vectors (6 rows and nScolumns) andΔγis the vector of nSplastic multiplier increments. In Eq. (63)μ⋆>0is a scaling parameter andϕ(ΔSˇab)is the vector function of nSyield functions; further details concerning this approach can be consulted in [9,6]. In Eq. (63), since we have the Macaulay brackets〈•〉, we have for each component the following interpretation:(65)μ⋆Δγi−〈μ⋆Δγi+ϕi(ΔSˇab)〉=0⇔(66)μ⋆Δγi+ϕi(ΔSˇab)≥0⇒ϕi(ΔSˇab)=0⇒Δγi≥0(67)μ⋆Δγi+ϕi(ΔSˇab)<0⇒Δγi=0⇒ϕi(ΔSˇab)<0In (64), functionsψigovern the internal variable evolution.

Functionφc(ΔSˇab,Δγ)contains the loading/unloading conditions, as can be proved:(69)φc(ΔSˇab,Δγ)=μ⋆Δγ−〈μ⋆Δγ+ϕ(ΔSˇab)〉≡0(70)⇔(71)Δγ≥0(72)Δγiϕi(ΔSˇab)=0(73)ϕ(ΔSˇab)≤0In (64), the set of internal variables (v) are updated using the backward-Euler integration method. In this work, the set of internal variables consist solely of the effective plastic strain. Constitutive functionsφi, required to determine the increment inv, are evaluated at step tb. The constitutive system (62)–(64) is solved forΔSˇabandΔγ. Since multiple yield surfaces are used, the traditional problem of active-set implementation is circumvented by the Chen–Mangasarian [19] smoothing approach.

In Fig. 4 comparisons are shown with the results presented in references [37,16,1,33,38,47,32,41,5] and the Abaqus S4 element. In all examples we use standard Gaussian quadrature with 2×2 Gauss points in the plane and 2 Gauss points along the thickness. Noting that although no enrichment of the displacement and rotation fields are performed, the present element is competitive with the best available formulations, which include enrichment.Linear shell tests are important for assessing competitiveness in both linear and nonlinear codes. Results in nonlinear problems are conditioned by the inherent linear formulation. However, due to the presence of complex constitutive laws, stress integration and other factors, results from nonlinear problems are seldom conclusive with respect to the accuracy of the underlying interpolation approach. Therefore, we first focus on the four classical shell tests depicted in Fig. 6. This figure contains the relevant data required to reproduce the problems. Results are compared with known element formulations in Figs. 7 and 8. Test #1 is the well-known pinched cylinder problem (a reference value of1.82488×10−5mis used in the normalization, in agreement with Simo, Fox and Rifai [44]). For this test, results shown in Fig. 7 attest the good performance of the present element. Test #2 is the Scordelis-Lo roof (see [34]) in which our element was found to have similar performance to the S4 element from Abaqus. Our implementation of Dvorkin and Bathe [24] MITC4 element results in slightly stiffer results in both tests #1 and #2. Test #3 is the closed pinched hemisphere33The open 18° variant does not provide additional information.with a target value of the radial displacement of 0.0924 [44]. In this test, we found that our element converges faster than the S4 and MITC4 elements for coarse meshes. The test #4 is the so-called twisted beam and it has been adopted in many references with several variants. Our variant is the most demanding (with a thickness of 0.0032 m) and was proposed by Belytschko and Wong [18]. Two load cases are inspected, as indicated in Fig. 6. Excellent results were obtained by the present formulation in case A. The present results are better than the previous high-performance element HIS (cf. [5]) and QBM (cf. [14]). To further analyze the performance effect of the frame choice in a distorted mesh, we use a full version of the cylinder problem (#1) which we denote #1 distorted, cf. Fig. 9.Only the 30×30 mesh is employed here. Four frame combinations (covariant/covariant, covariant/contravariant, contravariant/covariant and contravariant/contravariant) are tested. We conclude that our choice of a covariant/contravariant frame provides the least sensitive results with respect to mesh distortion.This section shows the applicability to classical nonlinear problems and the capabilities of the formulation, specifically:•Higher levels of load and displacement factors than previously published.Comparatively large load steps and consistency of results between different load steps.Asymptotically quadratic rate of convergence for the Newton method.The classical geometrically nonlinear clamped cylinder problem is solved, with the corresponding data summarized in Fig. 10. Results for the clamped pinched cylinder (cf. [25]) are shown in Fig. 11. This attests the robustness of the proposed formulation and slightly less stiff results. We can also observe that only when very large steps are used, a slight drift becomes apparent. This problem was studied by Crisfield and Tan [23], where instabilities were detected for the Morley element.The channel beam problem was proposed by Chróścielewski׳s group [20], with a longer beam version being introduced by Wagner and Gruttmann [49]. More recently, Chróścielewski and Witkowski [21] compared the results for both versions. We use these references for comparison with our results, in addition to the TUBA element implementation by Vladimirov (cf. [29]) and our corotational triangle [8]. Relevant data is shown in Fig. 12for the two cases. In case I, comparison with results of Chróścielewski and Witkowski (EAS14m1), cf. Fig. 13, shows that the present element is less stiff and we achieve a total displacement of 6 consistent units, when compared with 2.5 in other references. Our own corotational triangle (cf. [8]) produces slightly stiffer results with a comparable mesh. Only TUBA 13 triangle, using a sixth order polynomial, achieves more flexible results than the ones of the present element. We also test step-size sensitivity in Fig. 14which perfectly illustrates the robustness of our formulation. Results for case II are shown in Fig. 15, where we can observe that Wagner and Gruttmann results are slightly stiffer, a fact also reported by Chróścielewski and Witkowski [21].Another important example for geometrically nonlinear problems is the pulled ring by Basar and Ding [15], cf. Fig. 16. We here use the well-known solution by Sansour and Kollmann [42] as comparison. The problem consists of a circular ring plate with a radial cut which is clamped on one side and loaded along its radial free edge by a uniform load q, see Fig. 16, where the deformed configurations for three values of load are shown. Arc-length control is adopted to obtain the solution in this problem.A comparison with the results of Sansour and Kollmann is presented in Fig. 17. We can observe that much higher values of loading and deformation are achieved by the present element and overall there is good agreement with published results. The triangular element previously proposed (i.e. [8]) also produces slightly stiffer results (not represented here).Two finite strain plasticity problems are solved using our recent algorithm (cf. [6]): the elasto-plastic plate under deformation-dependent pressure and the pinched cylinder (both with zero normal stress von-Mises plasticity). Relevant data and deformed meshes (and contour plots) for these problems are shown in Figs. 18 and 19. The plate under pressure was described by Hauptmann et al. [27] and further inspected in [5]. It consists of a plate with dimensions 508×508×2.54 consistent units. Elasticity modulus isE=6.9×104consistent units, Poisson coefficientν=0.3and the yield stress isσy=248consistent units. One-fourth of the plate is analyzed with 32×32 elements with a sequence of deformed meshes and the effective plastic strain contour plot shown in the sub-figure in Fig. 18. Results are presented in Fig. 20. As for the other problem (pinched cylinder test with soft support), it is depicted in Fig. 19 and was also tested in [5]. It consists of a cylinder with 300mm of radius, with E=3000MPa,ν=0.3and a linear hardening law:σy=24.3+300εpMPa. Load–deflection results for the 16×16 are shown in Fig. 20, are close to the ones by Wagner, Klinkel and Gruttmann [50] for high values of pinching displacement.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented a consistent mixed quadrilateral shell based on least-squares in-plane strains presenting high performance even in the presence of mesh distortions. In terms of degrees-of-freedom, the element is equivalent to a degenerated displacement/rotation element and in terms of performance, it is at least equivalent to (often surpassing) EAS formulations (cf. [5]). However, it is appropriate for non-smooth problems. In addition, a consistent updated-Lagrangian algorithm was proposed with exact linearization which provided a very simple connection with the constitutive algorithms previously studied (cf. [6]). The algorithm is both equilibrium-consistent between time-steps and consistently linearized. With that purpose, a simplification of our recent multiple-surface algorithm [6] was employed with a good degree of success and excellent time-step independence. Linear examples showed very good results and low mesh distortion sensitivity. Three geometrically nonlinear problems and two finite strain plasticity problems were presented. We have shown excellent robustness as well as good agreement with published results using more intricate formulations. Finally, we must remark that the linearization was partly performed with Wolfram Mathematica [40] with the AceGen [30] add-on. The software employed was SIMPLAS [4].
