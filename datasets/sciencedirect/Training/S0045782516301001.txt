@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We develop a fractional extension of a mass-conserving Allen–Cahn phase field model that describes the mixture of two incompressible fluids. The fractional order controls the sharpness of the interface, which is typically diffusive in integer-order phase-field models. The model is derived based on an energy variational formulation. An additional constraint is employed to make the Allen–Cahn formulation mass-conserving and comparable to the Cahn–Hilliard formulation but at reduced cost. The spatial discretization is based on a Petrov–Galerkin spectral method whereas the temporal discretization is based on a stabilized ADI scheme both for the phase-field equation and for the Navier–Stokes equation. We demonstrate the spectral accuracy of the method with fabricated smooth solutions and also the ability to control the interface thickness between two fluids with different viscosity and density in simulations of two-phase flow in a pipe and of a rising bubble. We also demonstrate that using a formulation with variable fractional order we can deal simultaneously with both erroneous boundary effects and sharpening of the interface at no extra resolution.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The interfacial dynamics of immiscible fluids is of great interest in multi-phase flow systems but computationally not easy to resolve. The common modeling approaches can be broadly divided into two types of sharp- and diffuse-interface models. The sharp-interface models assume a zero-thickness layer that separates the two fluids. The layer is endowed with properties such as surface tension, and matching boundary conditions are imposed on either side of the dividing surface. For numerical simulation of two-phase flow systems with sharp-interface models, moving-grid methods are commonly used with conforming elements around the interface  [1,2]. However, the possibility of mesh entanglement restricts the moving-grid approaches to cases with mild deformation of the interface. Even for such cases, careful remeshing of the domain is required to resolve the interface. In contrast, the diffuse-interface models assume a layer of finite thickness between the two phases. Instead of formulating the flow governing equations in two domains separated by an interface, these methods represent the interfacial tension as a body-force or bulk-stress spreading over a narrow layer covering the interface. This approach yields a unified set of governing equations for the two phases, solved on a fixed grid in a purely Eulerian framework. Numerical methods such as Volume-of-Fluid  [3,4] and level-set  [4,5] have been successfully employed to simulate two-phase flows.A relatively recent diffuse-interface model for multi-phase flow systems is based on phase fields, long used in materials science problems. The energy-based variational framework of phase-field formulations makes them a thermodynamically-consistent and physically attractive approach to model multi-phase flow systems (cf.  [6–8]). The phase-field model can be viewed as a physically motivated level-set method; however, unlike the level-set model, where an artificial smoothing function is prescribed for the interface, the Cahn–Hilliard model and Allen–Cahn model describe the interface based on the concept of mixing energy. This energy-based description of phase-field models also allows the modeling of complex rheology of non-Newtonian fluids or complex interfacial dynamics to be easily incorporated into the formulation  [9,10]. In this paper we will focus on a new fractional mass-conserving Allen–Cahn model, which we derive from a fractional order mixing energy formulation.The Allen–Cahn equation was originally introduced to describe the motion of anti-phase boundaries in crystalline solids  [11]. If the phases are immiscible, one can introduce a non-local Lagrange multiplierξ(t)in the Allen–Cahn equation to enforce the volume fraction conservation (cf.  [12]), namely,(1.1){ϕt−γ(Δϕ−f(ϕ)+ξ(t))=0,(x,t)∈Ω×(0,T],ddt∫Ωϕdx=0,∂ϕ∂n|∂Ω=0,ϕ(x,0)=ϕ0,whereΩ∈Rn,n=2(here) is a bounded domain with a convex polygonal domain,nis the outward normal,f(ϕ)=F′(ϕ),F(ϕ)=14η2(ϕ2−1)2is a double-well potential which achieves the global minimum value atϕ=±1, and the Lagrange multiplier isξ(t)=∫Ωf(ϕ)dx. Originally,ϕrepresented the concentration of one of the two metallic components of the alloy and the parameterηrepresented the interfacial length, which is extremely small compared to the characteristic (large) scale of the system. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition implies that no mass loss occurs across the boundary walls. In order to demonstrate the mass-conserving property of the constrained Allen–Cahn equation we simulated two-phase flow in a tube with two fluids of different viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbersRe1=66.6(fluid 1) andRe2=200(fluid 2). The initial phase-field profile is given by the following hyperbolic tangent function:ϕ(x;0)=−tanh((x2+y2−r1)/(2η)),x∈Ω={(r,z):0<r<L/2,0≤z≤10L},wherer1=0.4is the radius for the initial position of the interface,ηis the interface thickness between the two fluids andL=1is the characteristic length. The analytic solution and initial conditions for the velocity are exactly the same as in  [13,14]. In Fig. 1we plot the error of the solution in the streamwise velocity obtained based on the constrained Allen–Cahn model but also on the Cahn–Hilliard model; the latter conserves mass, see  [15,16]. We see that the Allen–Cahn model is even more accurate than the Cahn–Hilliard as it employs a second-order operator unlike the Cahn–Hilliard that requires numerical resolution of a fourth-order operator. Attempting to simulate the same problem with the unconstrained Allen–Cahn model would lead to an instability due to the violation of mass conservation. The Allen–Cahn equation can also be viewed as a gradient flow with Lyapunov energy functional∫Ω12|∇ϕ|2+1η2F(ϕ)dx. Recently, the Allen–Cahn equation has been widely applied to many complicated moving interface problems, for example, vesicle membranes, nucleation of solids, and mixture of two incompressible fluids, etc. (cf.  [12,17–22]).Fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) are generalizations of the integer-order models, based on fractional calculus. They are becoming increasingly popular as a flexible modeling tool for diffusive processes associated with sub-diffusion (fractional in time), super-diffusion (fractional in space) or both. Recently, FPDEs have been applied to diverse fields, including control theory, biology, electro-chemical processes, viscoelastic materials, polymers, finance, etc.; see, e.g.,  [23–34] and the references therein. In particular, fractional diffusion equations have been used to describe the so-called anomalous diffusion phenomenon. In fact, anomalous diffusion is ubiquitous in physical and biological systems where trapping and binding of particles may occur; see, e.g.,  [35–39]. In this paper, we will consider sub-diffusion effects for the phase-field model.One of the shortcomings of FPDEs is that they are computationally expensive since even low-order discretizations lead to dense matrices due to their non-local character. To this end, direction splitting methods (alternating direction implicit or ADI methods) are powerful techniques, which allow us to split the underlying high dimensional problem into a set of one-dimensional sub-problems, thus reducing considerably the computational complexity for some classical problems (Navier–Stokes equation, diffusion equations, and so on.); see, e.g.,  [40,41]. The ADI scheme we develop below for the fractional phase field model is a straight-forward extension of its counterpart for the traditional diffusion equation  [42,43].The objective of this paper is to re-formulate the constrained Allen–Cahn equation coupled to Navier–Stokes equations within the fractional calculus framework in order to simulate multi-phase flow systems with tunable sharpness of the interface. The paper is organized as follows. In Section  2 we develop the fractional governing equations. In Section  3 we present the numerical discretization schemes and corresponding convergence results. In Section  4 we present numerical simulations of two-phase flows, including simulations with variable-fractional order. In Section  5 we provide a short summary. In the Appendices we derive an energy law for the fractional Navier–Stokes/phase-field model and also present discretization details along with some convergence results.We consider a mixture of two immiscible and incompressible fluids with densitiesρ1,ρ2and viscositiesμ1,μ2. In order to identify the regions occupied by the two fluids, we introduce a phase-field functionϕsuch that(2.1)ϕ(x,t)={1,fluid 1,−1,fluid 2,with the smooth transition layer of thicknessηconnecting the two fluids so the interface of the mixture can be described byΓt={x:ϕ(x,t)=0}. LetF(ϕ)=14η2(ϕ2−1)2be the Ginzburg–Landau double-well potential, and define the fractional mixing energy functional(2.2)E(ϕ,∇sϕ)=∫Ω(12|∇sϕ|2+F(ϕ))dx,where the fractional gradient is defined as∇s=(∂s∂xs,∂s∂ys),12<s≤1, and∂s∂xsand∂s∂ysare fractional operators which will be defined in the following. Also,E(ϕ,∇sϕ)represents the competition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the two-phase flow. Then, the dynamics of the phase-fieldϕis determined by the gradient flow(2.3)ϕt+(u⋅∇)ϕ=−γδEδϕ,whereγis a relaxation time andδEδϕis the variational derivative. Specifically,δEδϕis a generalization of the Euler–Lagrange equation, and it can be taken in theL2space, hence leading to the (non-conserving) fractional Allen–Cahn equation(2.4)ϕt+(u⋅∇)ϕ=γ(Δsϕ−f(ϕ)),wheref(ϕ)=F′(ϕ), andΔsis the fractional Laplace operator to be defined. For immiscible two-phase flows, we can introduce a non-local Lagrange multiplierξ(t)in the Allen–Cahn equation to enforce the volume fraction conservation,(2.5)ϕt+(u⋅∇)ϕ=γ(Δsϕ−f(ϕ)+ξ(t)),ddt∫Ωϕdx=0.Next, we introduce the fractional operators. The fractional derivative∂s∂xs, with0<s≤1,Λ=[a,b], can be defined in the Riemann–Liouville sense as follows:(2.6)RLDxsϕ(x)=1Γ(1−s)ddx∫axϕ(ξ)dξ(x−ξ)s,∀x∈Λ,(2.7)RLxDsϕ(x)=−1Γ(1−s)ddx∫xbϕ(ξ)dξ(ξ−x)s,∀x∈Λ.We will also make use of the Caputo definition for the fractional derivative:(2.8)Dxsϕ(x)=1Γ(1−s)∫axϕ′(ξ)dξ(x−ξ)s,∀x∈Λ,(2.9)xDsϕ(x)=−1Γ(1−s)∫xbϕ′(ξ)dξ(ξ−x)s,∀x∈Λ.Usually,RLDxsandDxsare called the left-sided fractional derivatives, andRLxDsandxDsthe right-sided fractional derivatives of orders. It can be proved  [44]lims→1RLDxs=−lims→1RLxDs=lims→1Dxs=−lims→1xDs=∂∂x,∀x∈(a,b). The fractional gradient operator can be defined:(2.10)∇s=(Dxs,Dys),Left-type ,(2.11)∇s=(xDs,yDs),Right-type ,(2.12)∇s=12(Dxs+xDs,Dys+yDs),Symmetry-type .We can also define the fractional Laplace operator in different ways, but this is still an open issue for bounded domains (cf.  [45–50]). In these papers the fractional Laplacian is often defined through a fractional power of the spectral decomposition of the standard Laplacian. Another possible definition isΔs≔∇s⋅∇s. Here we choose to use (2.12) as the definition of∇sand define the fractional Laplace operatorΔsof the above system (2.28)–(2.31) as follows (see comments in Remark 2.3 for a motivation):(2.13)Δs≔12(RLDxsDxs+RLxDsxDs+RLDysDys+RLyDsyDs).The fractional Allen–Cahn equation can describe spinodal decomposition  [46,50–52], and chemical and contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers  [26,53,54].The fractional momentum equation for the two-phase system takes the form:(2.14)ρ(ut+(u⋅∇)u)=∇⋅μD(u)−∇p−λ(Δsϕ∇ϕ+12∇|∇sϕ|2),whereD(u)=∇u+∇uT, andλis the mixing energy density.Remark 2.1The last term on the right-hand-side of the above equation can be described as follows in the case of integer-order (i.e.,s=1):(2.15)Δϕ∇ϕ+12∇|∇ϕ|2=∇⋅(∇ϕ⊗∇ϕ),where∇ϕ⊗∇ϕis the extra elastic stress induced by the interfacial surface tension.In Eq. (2.14),ρandμare dependent variables defined by the linear average(2.16)ρ(ϕ)=ρ1−ρ22ϕ+ρ1+ρ22,μ(ϕ)=μ1−μ22ϕ+μ1+μ22.Hence, the Allen–Cahn phase equation (2.5) and the momentum equation (2.14), together with the incompressibility constraint(2.17)∇⋅u=0,and suitable boundary and initial condition, form a complete system for(u,p,ϕ)withρandμgiven by (2.16).To be specific, we consider the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions foru:(2.18)u|∂Ω=0,and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions forϕ:(2.19)−12(Ix1−sDxsϕ(x,y)+xI1−sxDsϕ(x,y))|x=a=0,12(Ix1−sDxsϕ(x,y)+xI1−sxDsϕ(x,y))|x=b=0,(2.20)−12(Iy1−sDysϕ(x,y)+yI1−syDsϕ(x,y))|y=a=0,12(Iy1−sDysϕ(x,y)+yI1−syDsϕ(x,y))|y=b=0,whereIzγdenotes the fractional integral of orderγ, defined in the Riemann–Liouville sense as follows:(2.21)Izγφ(z)=1Γ(γ)∫azφ(ξ)(z−ξ)γ−1dξ,∀z∈Λ,(2.22)zIγφ(z)=1Γ(γ)∫zbφ(ξ)(ξ−z)γ−1dξ,∀x∈Λ.Remark 2.2We can rewrite the boundary conditions as follows:(2.23)−12(Dx2s−1ϕ(x,y)+xD2s−1ϕ(x,y))|x=a=0,12(Dx2s−1ϕ(x,y)+xD2s−1ϕ(x,y))|x=b=0,(2.24)−12(Dy2s−1ϕ(x,y)+yD2s−1ϕ(x,y))|y=a=0,12(Dy2s−1ϕ(x,y)+yD2s−1ϕ(x,y))|y=b=0.Ifs=1, the boundary conditions in (2.19) and (2.20) can be replaced by the standard homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, i.e.,∇ϕ⋅n|∂Ω=0.When the density ratio is small, a usual approach is to use the Boussinesq approximation, i.e., replacing (2.14) by(2.25)ρ0(ut+(u⋅∇)u)=∇⋅μD(u)−∇p−λ(Δsϕ∇ϕ+12∇|∇sϕ|2)+g(ρ1,ρ2),whereρ0=ρ1+ρ22andg(ρ1,ρ2)is an additional gravitational force to account for the density difference.Remark 2.3We emphasize that there exist several ways to define the fractional gradient and fractional Laplacian. These definitions are not necessarily equivalent to each other, and an energy law is only available for those definitions which possess certain self-adjoint property. An energy law analysis of the new system (2.5)–(2.17)–(2.25), subject to the boundary conditions (2.18)–(2.20), is given in Appendix ATheorem A.1. When the density ratio is large, the Boussinesq approximation is no longer valid, and thus we have to face a fractional momentum equation with variable density. In this case the momentum equations have to be modified in a physically consistent way to obtain an energy law; see also Appendix A for more details.Next, we reformulate the system (2.4)–(2.14)–(2.17) into an equivalent form, which is more convenient for numerical approximation. Here,F(ϕ)is given by(2.26)F(ϕ)=14η2(ϕ2−1)2.Using the phase-field equation (2.4), and the fact thatf(ϕ)∇ϕ=∇F(ϕ), we have(2.27)∇p+λ(Δsϕ∇ϕ+12∇|∇sϕ|2)=∇(p+λ2|∇sϕ|2+λF(ϕ))+λγ(ϕt+u⋅∇ϕ)∇ϕ.Therefore, if we define the modified pressure asΠ=p+λ2|∇sϕ|2+λF(ϕ), we can rewrite the system (2.4)–(2.14)–(2.17) as(2.28)ϕt+(u⋅∇)ϕ=γ(Δsϕ−f(ϕ)),(2.29)ρ(ϕ)=ρ1−ρ22ϕ+ρ1+ρ22,μ(ϕ)=μ1−μ22ϕ+μ1+μ22,(2.30)ρ(ut+(u⋅∇)u)=∇⋅μD(u)−∇Π−λ(ϕt+u⋅∇ϕ)∇ϕ,(2.31)∇⋅u=0.We will solve the system of equations (2.28)–(2.31) by replacingf(ϕ)byf(ϕ)−ξ(t)in the phase-field equation (2.28) to ensure mass conservation.In this section we present the direction splitting scheme (ADI) for the phase-field equation, which is second-order in time. In Appendix B, we also provide a similar second-order scheme for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We employ the Legendre spectral method for spatial discretization for constant fractional order, and Petrov–Galerkin method for variable fractional model. We then verify the accuracy of the coupled scheme and quantify its convergence rates for different state variables through a fabricated smooth solution.LetLbe the number of the time steps to integrate up to final timeT, thenΔt=T/L. We denote by superscripts the time levels and set initial conditionsϕ0=ϕ(x,0),ϕ−1=ϕ0,u0=u(x,0),u−1=u0,Π−12=p0,ψ−12=0, andρ̄=min(ρ1,ρ2). (Here, we simulate with a first-order scheme in the first time step.) We look for solutions of(ϕn+1,un+1,Πn+12,ψn+12)forn=0,…,L−1. We introduce the following notation for convenience:(3.1)ϕn+12=12(ϕn+1+ϕn),ϕ∗,n+12=12(3ϕn−ϕn−1),ϕˆn+1={1,ϕn+1≥1,ϕn+1,|ϕn+1|≤1,−1,ϕn+1≤−1,ρn+12=ρn+1+ρn2,ρ∗,n+12=12(3ρn−ρn−1),μn+12=μn+1+μn2,un+12=12(un+1+un),u∗,n+12=12(3un−un−1),p⋆,n+12=Πn−12+ψn−12.•  Phase field:(3.2)ϕn+1−ϕnΔt−γ(Δsϕn+12−f(ϕ∗,n+12))+(u∗,n+12⋅∇)ϕ∗,n+12+SΔtη2(ϕn+1−ϕn)=0,with boundary conditions defined in (2.19) and (2.20). Here,SΔtη2(ϕn+1−ϕn)is an extra stability term, which was introduced in  [55] for the integer-order case. If the parameterSsatisfiesS≥l24η2, then the above scheme is unconditionally stable, wherelis the upper bound of|f′(ϕ)|, withF(ϕ)modified as Eq. (4.9) in  [10].Remark 3.1We will solve the phase-field equation (3.2) by replacingf(ϕ∗,n+12)byf(ϕ∗,n+12)−ξ∗,n+12to ensure mass conservation, whereξ∗,n+12=1|Ω|∫Ωf(ϕ∗,n+12)dx.In order to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, we will employ the spectral direction splitting method  [40] based on pressure-stabilization. In Appendix B, we summarize this scheme and present numerical results in order to obtain the convergence rate of the velocity and pressure fields before coupling them to the phase-field.The ADI scheme for the fractional phase-field (3.2) is given by:(3.6)ζn+1−ϕnΔt−γ(Δsϕn−f(ϕ∗,n+12))+(u∗,n+12⋅∇)ϕ∗,n+12+SΔtη2(ζn+1−ϕn)=0,φn+1−ζn+112Δt−14γ(RLDxsDxs+RLxDsxDs)(φn+1−ϕn)+SΔtη2(φn+1−ζn+1)=0,ϕn+1−φn+112Δt−14γ(RLDysDys+RLyDsyDs)(ϕn+1−ϕn)+SΔtη2(ϕn+1−φn+1)=0,with the homogeneous fractional Neumann boundary conditions (2.19) and (2.20). The velocity and phase-field are represented as Legendre expansions of orderNwhereas the pressure is represented as a Legendre expansion of orderN−2, see Appendices B and C.In order to test the convergence rates of all state variables, we consider the system inΩ=[−1,1]2withμ=1and suitable forcing functions such that the exact solutions of phase-fieldϕ, densityρ, velocityuand pressurepare given by:ϕ(x,t)=sin(t)cos(πx)cos(πy),ρ(x,t)=ϕ+2,u(x,t)=πsin(t)(sin(2πy)sin2(πx),−sin(2πx)sin2(πy)),p(x,t)=sin(t)cos(πx)sin(πy),and the densities of the two fluids areρ1=3,ρ2=1, while the viscosities areμ1=μ2=1. Here we employ the fixed parameterχ=0.5.We used 652 Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto points so the spatial discretization errors are negligible compared with the time discretization error. In Fig. 2, we plot theL2-errors of the velocity, pressure, and density between the numerical solution and the exact solution att=1with different time step sizes and different fractional orderss=0.85ands=1.00, respectively. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the scheme is second-order accurate in time for density (i.e., phase-field) and velocity, while the pressure approximation has 1.7-order accuracy in time; the latter is consistent with the results for the Navier–Stokes equation presented in the Appendix B.Next, we investigate the fractional phase-field equation converging to the integer-order model as the fractional order2sis approaching 2. We set the forcing term of the phase-field equation equal to the one derived from the exact solutions corresponding tos=1. In Fig. 3we see that the solutions of the fractional phase-field model are approaching the integer-order phase-field solutions with linear convergence with respect to the parameter(1−s).In the following, we test the new fractional model for two multi-phase flows: the first one is pipe flow and the second one is a rising bubble in the presence of gravity. We demonstrate that the fractional model recovers the integer-order model but additionally we can control the sharpness of the interface by the fractional orders. We also address some issues regarding boundary conditions, and to this end we introduce a variable-order fractional model, where the ordersvaries in space.Here we set the domainΩ=[−10,10]×[−1,1], and define the boundary conditions on top and bottom as no-slip walls, with the left boundary being the inlet (Dirichlet) and the right boundary the outlet (zero Neumann). Specifically, the initial and boundary conditions for the two-phase laminar flow are as follows: for velocity, we use the fully-developed velocity profile at the inlet and also as the initial set up:(4.1)u(y)={C[1−δ2+μˆ(δ2−y2)]δ3(μˆ+1),0≤|y|≤δ,C(1−y2)δ3(μˆ+1),δ<|y|≤1,whereμˆ=μ2μ1,δ=0.8,C=2. The initial profile of the phase-field isϕ=−tanh(|y|−0.8η).In Fig. 4we plot: (a) streamwise profiles of the velocityuin steady state, and (b) the distribution of the phase-field for different fractional orders. Here we use a grid with 2572 points (N=256) on the domainΩ, and setη=132,Δt=0.005, densitiesρ1=ρ2=1, and viscositiesμ1=0.015,μ2=μ1/3. The profile of the velocity with fractional orders=0.75is more accurate than the integer-order model; this difference is more pronounced in the phase-field that exhibits a much sharper interface than the case ofs=1.Next, we add the gravity term in the Navier–Stokes equation and simulate the rising of a bubble under different conditions. For the simulations shown in Fig. 5, we setη=0.02,γ=1,λ=0,ρ1=ρ2=1,μ1=μ2=0.1,Δt=0.001,N=200, and the initial conditionϕ(x,0)=tanh(|x+y|+|x−y|−0.6η). First, without any flow motion (λ=0) we test the mass-conserving property of the fractional Allen–Cahn model. We see from the plots of Fig. 5(a) and (b) that the mass of the phase-field is not conserved without the Lagrange multipleξ(t). We notice that the rectangular bubble quickly deforms into a circular bubble due to the surface tension, while the size of the bubble shrinks and eventually approaches zero size. The decaying rate of the size of the bubble is smaller for the fractional order (s=0.9) compared to the integer model (s=1.0). When we employ the constrained Allen–Cahn model mass conservation is valid, and as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the initially rectangular bubble approaches a circular bubble in steady state. Table 1shows that discrete mass is conserved in steady state using this model. Fig. 6shows the profiles of the phase field along the horizontal centerline; the interface corresponding to the fractional order (s=0.9) model is sharper than the integer-order model (s=1.0). Next, we perform a parametric study to investigate the effect of grid resolution and of the parameterηgoverning the interface thickness. Figs. 7 and 8summarize these simulations. It is interesting that for low resolution and smallηthe initial square bubble does not achieve a circular shape, the latter being the correct answer obtained for higher resolution and smallη. The smaller fractional orders=0.75leads to a sharper interface for all resolutions and for all values ofη.Next, we present numerical simulations of the bubble rising for a low density ratio. In this case all four boundaries are walls with a no-slip flow velocity as boundary condition. The densities areρ1=0.5,ρ2=3ρ1, and the viscosities areμ1=μ2=0.1,g=10,λ=0.1,γ=1,Δt=10−3,T=1.8,η=0.04,N=256, and the external body forcegis the buoyancy force. Initially the bubble is described byϕ(x,0)=tanh(x2+(y+0.4)2−0.3η). It starts as a circular bubble near the bottom of the domain and then it rises, see Fig. 9. Specifically, Fig. 9 shows the bubble rising for fractional orders=0.85,0.90,1.00. The interface between the bubble and the background fluid is sharper for smaller fractional order, however the rising speed also depends on the fractional order. Moreover, for even smaller values of the fractional ordersthe flow physics we simulate changes substantially corresponding to anomalous diffusion, which has an effect not only on the rising speed but also on the shape of the bubble. This is shown in simulations corresponding tos=0.75in Fig. 10. All parameters have the same values as before except for the fractional order. In addition, Fig. 11shows the profiles of the phase field at steady stateT=1.8. We can see that the phase-field profiles along the horizontal direction aty=1(upper wall) are quite different for different fractional orders. Fig. 11(a) shows that in terms of the heightϕ0.75(0,1)<ϕ0.85(0,1)<ϕ0.90(0,1)<ϕ1.00(0,1), whereϕs(0,1)denotes the value of the phase-field with fractional ordersat the point(0,1). The fractional phase-field model causes a boundary layer, due to its non-local nature, see Fig. 11(b). In the next subsection, we will present a variable-fractional order phase-field model that can eliminate this boundary layer artifact.Fractional calculus allows us to define derivatives of variable order that may depend on time or space or both [56,57]. Hence, we can exploit this new freedom to deal with boundary conditions, discontinuities but also with multi-rate physics that may change locally or in time; see several examples in  [56]. Here, we employ variable-fractional models to remove the artificial boundary layers at the walls in the rising bubble simulations, which were created due to the non-local nature of the fractional operators with fractional orderssmaller than 1; see examples in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 11. Hence, we introduce a variable-fractional orders(x,y), i.e., depending on the position, and we chooses→1close to the walls but maintains<1away from the walls where the bubble is located.We have repeated the bubble rising simulations with the variable-fractional order along thex-direction (horizontal) given by2s(x)=(r+2s(0))−r2−x2,r=1+(2−2s(0))22(2−2s(0)), wheres(0)<1is the fixed order atx=0. The variation of the fractional order along they-direction (vertical) is the same as in thex-direction, see Fig. 12. The variable-fractional operator is defined as(4.2)D2s(x)ϕ(x)=ddx[1Γ(2−2s(x))(∫ax(x−τ)1−2s(x)ϕ′(τ)dτ+∫xb(τ−x)1−2s(x)ϕ′(τ)dτ)],with the boundary condition is given(4.3)−(Dx2s(x)−1ϕ(x)+xD2s(x)−1ϕ(x))|x=a=0,(Dx2s(x)−1ϕ(x)+xD2s(x)−1ϕ(x))|x=b=0,and all other simulation parameters are the same as in Section  4.2.Fig. 13shows the evolutions of the phase-field with variable-fractional orders(x,y). The diffusion rate in the middle of the domain is slower than the diffusion rate near the boundary in the case ofs(0)=0.75. The bubble is elongated along the (vertical)y-direction because of the different diffusion rates in the domain. Fig. 14shows the phase-field profiles along the linesy=1andx=0att=1.8, respectively. It is evident that the boundary layers are eliminated at all fractional orders, i.e.,s(0)=0.75,0.85,0.90.
