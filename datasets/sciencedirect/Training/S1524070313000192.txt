@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a robust thickness estimation approach for 3D objects based on the Shape Diameter Function (SDF). Our method first applies a modified strategy to estimate the local diameter with increased accuracy. We then compute a scale-dependent robust thickness estimate from a point cloud, constructed using this local diameter estimation and a variant of a robust distance function. The robustness of our method is benchmarked against several operations such as remeshing, geometric noise and artifacts common in triangle soups. The experimental results show a more stable local thickness estimation than the original SDF, and consistent segmentation results on defect-laden inputs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Estimating the local thickness of complex 3D objects is a multi-faceted problem with a variety of applications. In computer graphics, algorithms such as mesh partitioning or curve skeleton extraction can successfully rely on a local thickness estimate such as the so-called Shape Diameter Function (SDF) [1]. In these applications, the robustness of the local thickness estimate is still a challenge. In this paper the notion of robustness relates to the resilience of the thickness estimate to both editing and processing operations applied to the shape, as well as to defect-laden inputs.A shape can be altered to meet the limited computational capabilities of heterogeneous computer hardware, by, e.g., matching a target level of detail. Assuming an input shape provided as a surface mesh, this goal commonly involves processing operations such as mesh simplification [2]. In this context, any thickness estimate should ideally be consistent for all levels of detail. A shape can also be animated, involving complex distortions. We expect that articulated animations have only minor effects on the thickness overall, as changes only occur at the joints which are in general a small subset of a shape. In this context, a local thickness estimate should ideally be consistent across all poses of an animation.When digitizing, the original physical shape is only known through sampling and approximation. A triangle mesh is an instance of such piecewise-linear approximation of a surface. In addition to the inherent uncertainty of any measurement device and imperfections of the acquisition process, some imperfect algorithms along the geometry processing pipeline may produce a range of artifacts such as gaps, holes, non-manifold parts and triangle soups. While a thread of research has focused on repairing defect-laden data or removing artifacts, there is currently no definitive solution to such defects [3]. Moreover, some applications gather data from heterogeneous inputs and thus require converting between shape representations. These conversions also lead to artifacts such as handles or disconnected components. Ideally, a thickness estimation would provide results that are both robust and consistent for all these cases.
