@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The prevalence of telework and other forms of mobile working enabled by digital technology is increasing markedly. Following a socio-technical systems approach, this study aims to examine the role of organisational social support and specific support for teleworkers in influencing teleworker wellbeing, the mediating role of social isolation, potentially resulting from a person-environment mismatch in these relationships, and possible differences in these relationships between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers. Teleworkers' (n = 804) perceptions of support and telework outcomes (psychological strain, job satisfaction, and social isolation) were collected using an on-line survey of teleworking employees distributed within 28 New Zealand organisations where knowledge work was undertaken. Organisational social support and teleworker support was associated with increased job satisfaction and reduced psychological strain. Social isolation mediated the relationship between organisational social support and the two outcome variables, and some differences were observed in the structural relationships for hybrid and low-intensity teleworker sub-samples. These findings suggest that providing the necessary organisational and teleworker support is important for enhancing the teleworker-environment fit and thereby ensuring desirable telework outcomes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There is little doubt that the nature of work is changing and mobile working enabled by advanced technology is an important mega-trend in the future of work. One such arrangement, telework, also known as telecommuting, remote working, agile working and anywhere working, is becoming increasingly popular and a common feature in work life due to advances in digital technology and changing attitudes towards where and when work is undertaken. To date, ergonomics research has paid little attention to this phenomenon, despite mobile work being identified as an important future of work/future of ergonomics concern for the discipline (Drury, 2008).Telework has grown in popularity due largely to advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) (e.g. broadband Internet, mobile devices, social media, cloud computing, and networking tools). As well as providing organisations and individuals with flexibility about when and where work takes place, telework and other forms of anywhere working have been viewed as a corollary of the push for organisations to move to network-based operating structures where employees are no longer tied to geographic locations (Bayrak, 2012). The requirement for organisations in some countries to consider requests from employees to switch to flexible working arrangements has been another key driver for telework adoption. Furthermore, telework popularity has risen as a result of speculations promoted by advocates of flexible working that telework arrangements can modernise workplace practice (Troup and Rose, 2012).Telework has been defined as “… a flexible work arrangement whereby workers work in locations, remote from their central offices or production facilities, with no personal contact with co-workers, but the ability to communicate with co-workers using ICT” (Di Martino and Wirth, 1990). This non-standard form of organisational dynamic presents unique challenges to teleworkers, managers and organisations (Rasmussen and Corbett, 2008; Bosua et al., 2013; Dahlstrom, 2013). Telework typically takes place in the home, but may also occur on the road, in a co-working centre, smart centre or digital work hub, or in other remote contexts. In most cases, the teleworker is isolated physically from their organisation, raising questions about how teleworkers relate to their colleagues and their organisation, and how best to provide support to ensure teleworker satisfaction, wellbeing, safety and performance.A number of meta-analyses have been conducted in recent years in an attempt to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of teleworking. Gajendran and Harrison (2007), for example, found positive outcomes for teleworkers, including increased job satisfaction, performance, autonomy and reduced work-family conflict (WFC). More recently, a meta-analysis by Martin and MacDonnell (2012) found positive relationships between telework and organisational outcomes, including perceived productivity, improved retention and organisational commitment, and improved performance within the organisation. However, the literature suggests that not all telework arrangements are effective and that negative outcomes are observed under some conditions (Mahler, 2012; Sardeshmukh et al., 2012; Tremblay and Thomsin, 2012), including social isolation (Golden et al., 2008), co-worker dissatisfaction (Golden, 2007), and the so-called ‘telework divide’, where negative impacts have been observed for those barred from telework (Mahler, 2012). Moreover, telework appears to be a time-dependent concept (Neufeld and Fang, 2005; Bélanger et al., 2012), with negative effects observed in some studies where telework intensity exceeds two or three days per week (Gajendran and Harrison, 2007).Bélanger et al. (2012) argue that socio-technical systems theory can be utilised to theorise and analyse how multiple factors jointly contribute to telework outcomes (Bélanger et al., 2012). From a socio-technical systems perspective (Trist, 1981; Eason et al., 1996; Lyytinen and Newman, 2008), and in line with Bélanger et al.'s (2012) conceptual model, organisational support in the telework context should address technical, person, and organisational sub-systems elements. The better the ‘fit’ between these sub-system elements, the more effective telework will be in terms of desired outcomes for the individual and organisation, whereas mismatches between system elements may result in work system failures and undesired outcomes. For example, person-environment fit problems (Haines et al., 2002) such as social isolation can occur where there is inadequate support for teleworkers, who are dependent upon technology and management support for coordinating their activities and collaborating with co-workers (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b).The major contribution of the present study, therefore, is to examine the role of organisational social support and specific teleworker support as predictors of desirable teleworker outcomes, considering the relative influence of each. The study examines the role of both forms of support in reducing psychological strain and enhancing job satisfaction. Based on the socio-technical systems approach and the notion of person-environment fit (Haines et al., 2002), the study also examines the mediating role of social isolation in the relationship between organisationally-derived support and these telework outcomes. The study considers the relationships between these study variables for two distinct teleworker cohorts: low intensity teleworkers, who may be day extenders, using technology to telework a few hours per week, verses hybrid teleworkers, who work one or more days per week remotely.Job satisfaction comprises individual perceptions of task activities, achievement, rewards, working conditions, and management practices. Stated more succinctly, it is a positive emotional state coming from an individual's subjective experience of their job (Locke, 1976). It is well understood that social interaction in the workplace is an important determinant of job satisfaction (Sims et al., 1976). It would, therefore, follow that a reduced frequency of interactions between teleworkers and their co-workers, due to the remote working arrangements, should impact negatively on telework job satisfaction. Given these concerns, it is argued that organisational support is of key importance in enhancing teleworker satisfaction and wellbeing, helping to reduce the potential loss of satisfaction and wellbeing due to lower levels of social interaction associated with telework.Perceived organisational support (POS) is the degree to which employees believe that their organisation values their contributions and cares about their well-being (Eisenberger et al., 1997), while perceived social support refers to how much employees perceive that they are supported by their co-workers and supervisor (O'Driscoll, 2000). Both constructs are understood to be predictors of wellbeing outcomes in the workplace and are therefore considered to be important to telework outcomes. Importantly, specific support of teleworkers is thought to have an important influence on telework outcomes as telework differs from work undertaken in the central workplace in important ways and therefore requires a different management approach in order to yield productive outcomes (Bosua et al., 2013). Indeed, Lautsch et al. (2009) reported that teleworkers supervised with an information sharing approach were more likely to enjoy lower work-family conflict and increased work performance. Other authors have noted the importance of relationship-oriented behaviour when managing teleworkers, as opposed to task-oriented behaviour (Dahlstrom, 2013). For example, Kowalski and Swanson (2005) report that management support, communication and trust are critical success factors for telework. Trust appears to be a key determinant of telework effectiveness, impacting on telework attitudes and performance in the telework environment (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b). Other telework support factors examined in empirical research include: teleworker interaction with colleagues and manager (Neufeld and Fang, 2005); job resources, support and feedback for teleworkers (Sardeshmukh et al., 2012). Each of these studies reported a relationship between support for teleworkers and either positive telework outcomes, including satisfaction (Golden, 2006; Golden and Veiga, 2005), or absence of negative telework outcomes. Furthermore, Babin and Boles (1996) found that supervisor support reduced stress and increased job satisfaction.The little research that has been conducted looking at technical support for teleworkers suggests this form of support is essential for positive telework outcomes. Indeed, technical support is necessary to ensure effective coordination with the central office and co-workers (Bosua et al., 2013). Furthermore, research has indicated that the more that an individual teleworks the more support is sought and the greater level of formal support is required with regard to technology and training (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b; Bayrak, 2012). As a result, it is expected that teleworker job satisfaction will increase as organisational social support and teleworker support increase.Hypothesis 1Organisational social support will be positively related to job satisfaction.Teleworker support will be positively related to job satisfaction.Psychological strain and stress are often used interchangeably in the context of wellbeing research. Job stress has been described as the harmful physical and emotional responses that occur where the requirements (or demands) of the job do not match the capabilities, resources, or needs of the worker (NIOSH, 1999). Telework is characterised by both positive and negative impacts on teleworker psychological strain/stress. On the one hand, teleworking can increase workload through day extending (Towers et al., 2006), role ambiguity and reduce access to social support and feedback (Sardeshmukh et al., 2012). However, the argument for telework as a positive factor in reducing job stress appears more compelling from a Job Demands-Resources theory perspective, as the psychological demands on individuals can be reduced through avoidance of social and environmental stressors, while resources are increased through greater autonomy about where and when to work (Demerouti et al., 2001). Indeed, there is evidence that teleworking reduces exposure to commuting to work (Stephens and Szajna, 1998), increases opportunities for leisure and restoration due to (greater) flexibility and control over when work takes place (Mann and Holdsworth, 2003), and provides reduced work pressure and increased autonomy. Furthermore, teleworkers often enjoy fewer interruptions and distractions than their office-bound colleagues (Mann et al., 2000), thereby providing greater opportunity to concentrate and complete tasks to schedule. In further support of the contention that telework has a positive influence on wellbeing, a study by Fonner and Roloff (2010) found high-intensity teleworkers avoided stressors associated with collocated work environments, including overabundance of meetings and interruptions, and were more satisfied with their job as a result (Hartig et al., 2007).Telework involves working at home or another remote location without the usual structure and guidance provided by supervisors and other agents in the workplace, and teleworkers may receive less feedback and social support than the on-site employees enjoy. From a socio-technical systems perspective, it can be argued that organisational sources of support will influence the fit between teleworker, their work tasks and their environment, and thereby teleworker perceptions of their ability to manage the demands of telework. Having reliable technology and support for teleworking communications are good examples of how support can influence teleworker stress and strain. Given the important role of organisational support in previous research on telework (Neufeld and Fang, 2005; Lautsch et al., 2009; Aboelmaged and Subbaugh, 2012; Sardeshmukh et al., 2012), and the known positive influence of various forms of support from the workplace on wellbeing outcomes, including job stress, it is expected that teleworker psychological strain will decrease as organisational social support and teleworker support increases.Hypothesis 3Organisational social support will be negatively related to psychological strain.Teleworker support will be negatively related to psychological strain.Social isolation has been identified as a negative consequence of telework and has been associated with negative teleworker and organisational outcomes. In the workplace context, this phenomenon has been referred to as ‘professional isolation’: a state of mind or belief that one is out of touch with others in the workplace (Golden et al., 2008). Such isolation occurs where an individual's need to feel socially connected in the workplace is thwarted (Baumeister and Leary, 1995). In a study that compared telework with traditional work arrangements (Morganson et al., 2010), higher levels of workplace inclusion (a related construct to social isolation) were reported for office workers, with home-based workers reporting lower workplace inclusion. However, extant research has found not all teleworkers experience social or professional isolation (Duxbury and Neufeld, 1999).Looking at the evidence for why telework might result in feelings of isolation, a number of studies have found that remote working arrangements, such as telework, can place constraints on the workplace environment, social interactions, and accumulation of social capital among teleworkers (Baker et al., 2006b). Early research in this field indicated that teleworkers may be less able to effectively manage interpersonal relationships and interactions with others (Golden et al., 2008). Moreover, their ability to coordinate complex or ambiguous tasks may be impacted by remote working relationships, impacting on work performance.In the commentary above we have reviewed evidence for the beneficial role of organisational social support and teleworker support in determining telework outcomes, resulting in our predictions that organisationally-derived support would increase job satisfaction and reduce psychological stress experienced by teleworkers. Given the important influence of various forms of support from the workplace on wellbeing outcomes such as social isolation and work-family conflict (Griggs et al., 2013; Nohe and Sonntag, 2014), it is reasonable to expect that organisationally-derived support will have a positive influence on perceived social isolation. Telework support would also be predicted to influence social isolation by providing effective and reliable communication channels between the teleworker and co-workers, line-manager and the organisation (Bosua et al., 2013). Each form of support would be expected to enhance the potential for the development of personal relationships and sharing of task-related knowledge between mobile workers and co-workers. We therefore predict that organisationally-derived sources of support will be negatively related to social isolation:Hypothesis 5Organisational social support will be negatively related to social isolation.Teleworker support will be negatively related to social isolation.It has long been accepted in organisational theory that social interaction in the workplace, including friendship, rich communication, feedback and information sharing, is an important determinant of job satisfaction (Sims et al., 1976). While the quality of digital technologies that support teleworking improves teleworker connectivity constantly, a reduction in the quality and frequency of interactions between teleworkers and their co-workers, due to the remote working arrangements of the latter, should impact negatively on telework job satisfaction from this perspective. Indeed, the lack of social interaction in some telework roles can lead to feelings of isolation, resulting in decreased job satisfaction and commitment (Cooper and Kurland, 2002; Perez et al., 2002; Morganson et al., 2010), along with reduced performance (Golden et al. (2008). Teleworkers may feel ‘out of the loop’, unsure about their place in the organisation, concerned about missed opportunities at the office, and can experience co-worker jealousy (Gajendran and Harrison, 2007). Given evidence from previous research that social isolation promotes reduced satisfaction and increases workplace stress, we predict:Hypothesis 7Social isolation will be negatively related to job satisfaction.Social isolation will be positively related to psychological strain.As noted earlier, socio-technical systems thinking includes the notion of person-environment fit (Bélanger et al., 2012; Haines et al., 2002). Social isolation, in the teleworking context, is considered a potential product of a person-environment mismatch, due to insufficient or ineffective support for the teleworker, resulting in inadequate or poor social interaction, task support, and feelings of isolation, with potential impacts of such isolation being low job satisfaction and high strain. In support of this assertion, research has found organisational support to have an important role in telework (Neufeld and Fang, 2005; Lautsch et al., 2009; Aboelmaged and Subbaugh, 2012; Sardeshmukh et al., 2012), having a positive influence on wellbeing outcomes such as social isolation. In turn, research suggests that social isolation can lead to decreased perceived job satisfaction and increased stress (Cooper and Kurland, 2002; Perez et al., 2002; Morganson et al., 2010), As prior empirical research indicates that organisationally-derived support can reduce negative aspects of telework, including social isolation, and that social isolation promotes reduced satisfaction and increased stress, we predict:Hypothesis 9Social isolation will mediate the relationship between organisational social support and job satisfaction.Social isolation will mediate the relationship between organisational social support and psychological strain.Social isolation will mediate the relationship between teleworker support and job satisfaction.Social isolation will mediate the relationship between teleworker support and psychological strain.The relationship between stress/strain and job satisfaction is well established in the research literature (e.g. Cooper et al., 1989; Burke, 2001; Cass et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2014), although there is considerable debate about the direction of causality in this relationship, with job satisfaction reported in different studies to be either an antecedent, mediator, or outcome of job stress. No studies were found that explored this relationship within the telework literature. In the present study, psychological strain is predicted to negatively influence teleworker job satisfaction due to its impact on the emotional state of teleworkers and their subjective experience of their job (Locke, 1976). We therefore predict that:Hypothesis 13Psychological strain will have a negative influence on job satisfactionIt can be argued that low-intensity teleworkers (i.e. those individuals who work remotely less than one full day per week) and hybrid teleworkers (who telework one day or more) have different organisational support needs and experience different telework outcomes. Arguably, individuals working remotely for just a few hours per week are likely to be day-extenders, using digital devices to work into the evening or at weekends. Regardless, low-intensity teleworkers work remotely for just a relatively short period, and are therefore less likely to be as dependent on social and technical support as those who work remotely for longer periods. Moreover, these individuals are less likely to experience social isolation. Indeed, there is some evidence that telework is a time-dependent concept (Neufeld and Fang, 2005; Bélanger et al., 2012), with negative effects observed in some studies where telework intensity exceeds two or three days per week (Gajendran and Harrison, 2007). These findings and assertions are in-line with social-technical systems thinking, and person-environment fit (Haines et al., 2002), as mismatches between these sub-system elements are less likely to become evident over a brief period of remote working. In line with these contentions, we predict that:Hypothesis 14There will be differences across all relationships in the path model between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers.The proposed research model is shown in Fig. 1, which illustrates the predicted influence of two antecedents, organisational social support and teleworker support, on social isolation, psychological strain and job satisfaction.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study has added to the small literature that identifies organisational measures for enhancing individual and organisational outcomes of telework. It is clear that negative outcomes such as work isolation and job-related stress are a risk under this flexible work arrangement, and both social and technical support are important in negating these outcomes. Our findings suggest that organisations wishing to benefit from telework would be well advised to pay close attention to the support given to their teleworking staff. The more teleworking an individual is doing the more support they will need, and this requirement should be reflected in organisational policy and practices around telework. As teleworking and other forms of mobile working are considered a mega-trend and are increasingly prevalent among knowledge workers, understanding the work experience of teleworkers, factors that enhance their performance and wellbeing, and how best to ensure the effective management of teleworkers, will be increasingly important and should be the subject of the future of ergonomics research agenda.
