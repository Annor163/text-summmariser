Recently, the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-criteria Decision Making) approach, which can characterize the decision makers’ psychological behaviours under risk, has been introduced to handle multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. Moreover, Pythagorean fuzzy set is an effective tool for depicting uncertainty of the MCDM problems. In this paper, based on the prospect theory, we first extend the TODIM approach to solve the MCDM problems with Pythagorean fuzzy information. Then, we conduct simulation tests to analyze how the risk attitudes of the decision makers exert the influence on the results of MCDM under uncertainty. Finally, a case study on selecting the governor of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is made to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is to select the optimal alternative which behaves best from a finite set of alternatives with multiple criteria. It is a major component of decision science, whose theory has been widely applied in the fields of economy [1–3], management [4–6], engineering [7–9], etc. Many approaches have been proposed to handle the MCDM problems, such as TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) [10], ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing REality) [11], PROMETHEE [12]. Later on, with the increasing complexity of the MCDM problems in real world, it may be necessary to take the decision makers (DMs)’ risk attitudes into consideration in the process of MCDM.The prospect theory, initiated by Kahneman and Tversky [13], is a descriptive theory for decision making under risk. This theory incorporates three significant aspects [13]: (1) Reference dependence. The outcomes are manifested by gains and losses according to a reference alternative. (2) Diminishing sensitivity. For gains, the DMs are risk-averse. But for losses, they are risk-preference. (3) Loss aversion. The DMs are much more sensitive to losses than gains [14]. On the basis of the prospect theory, Gomes and Lima [15] first established a MCDM approach, called TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making), which is valid to solve the MCDM problems where the DMs’ psychological behaviours are considered.In addition, for the uncertainty of the MCDM problems, the DMs are difficult to provide the precise assessments for alternatives. To solve this issue, fuzzy set theory [16] has been applied to MCDM [17–19], which provides a crucial means of describing the complex information. Later on, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [20] as the extension of fuzzy set has been found to be of high-efficiency in managing the MCDM problems under uncertainty [21–23], which utilizes a membership degree and a non-membership degree, whose sum is less than or equal to 1, to assess an object from the positive side and the negative side simultaneously. More recently, Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) [24,25] has emerged as an effective tool for depicting uncertainty of the MCDM problems. The PFS is also characterized by the membership degree and the non-membership degree, whose sum of squares is less than or equal to 1, the PFS is more general than the IFS. In some cases, the PFS can solve the problems that the IFS cannot, for example, if a DM gives the membership degree and the non-membership degree as 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, then it is only valid for the PFS. In other words, all the intuitionistic fuzzy degrees are a part of the Pythagorean fuzzy degrees, which indicates that the PFS is more powerful to handle the uncertain problems.For the complexity of the things and the boundedness of the thought of our human beings, we usually cannot give the accurate judgments for things. The PFS is of strong ability to portray this kind of uncertainty by the positive assessment and the negative assessment, which can convey the ambiguity and the uncertainty of the DMs in the MCDM problems effectively. Based on the immense superiority of the PFS, in this paper, we intend to extend the TODIM approach to solve the MCDM problems with Pythagorean fuzzy information.Some previous studies have paid attention to capture the DMs’ attitudinal characters in the MCDM problems [26–28], which are useful to depict the DMs’ attitudes towards the unknown and uncertain things. For the complexity of the MCDM problems, uncertainty and risk are both typical factors we must take into account in the MCDM process. Thus, it is important for us to consider the DMs’ risk attitudes in the MCDM problem. As introduced before, TODIM is a valuable approach to consider the DMs’ psychological behaviour under risk. In order to depict the uncertainty and the risk of the MCDM problems simultaneously, some scholars have introduced the fuzzy TODIM approach [29,30], and the intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM approach [31,32]. But there is no study on the TODIM approach for Pythagorean fuzzy information in the existing literature.The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews some basic knowledge about the PFS and the classical TODIM. The Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach is proposed in Section 3 to solve the MCDM problems under uncertainty. In Section 4, we conduct simulation tests to analyze how the risk attitudes of the DMs exert an influence on the decision results. Section 5 gives a case study on selecting the governor of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to illustrate the applicability and the implementation process of the proposed approach. Finally, the paper ends up with some concluding remarks in Section 6.In this section, we first present the process of traditional TODIM approach in decision making, and then, we review some basic concepts related to Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS).The TODIM approach [15], proposed to consider the DM's psychological behaviour, can effectively handle the MCDM problems. Based on the prospect theory, this approach depicts the dominance of each alternative over others by constructing a function of multi-criteria values [13].Let Cj(j=1, 2, …, n) be the referred criteria, whose weight vector isw=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, withwj∈[0,1](j=1,2,…,n)and∑j=1nwj=1. Then for the alternatives Yi(i=1, 2, …, m), the decision matrixA=(aij)m×ncan be constructed, where aijis a criterion value provided by the DM over the alternative Yiwith respect to the criterion Cj. We definewjr=wj/wras the relative weight of the criterion Cjto Cr, andwr=max{wj|j=1,2,…,n}. Then the classical TODIM approach involves the following steps:Step 1. Normalize the decision matrixA=(aij)m×ninto the matrixS=(sij)m×n.Step 2. Calculate the dominance of the alternative Yiover each alternative Yoby(2.1)δ(Yi,Yo)=∑j=1nϕj(Yi,Yo),(i,o=1,2,…,m)where(2.2)ϕj(Yi,Yo)=wjr(sij−soj)/∑j=1nwjrifsij−soj>00ifsij−soj=0−1θ∑j=1nwjr(soj−sij)/wjrifsij−soj<0and the parameter θ represents the attenuation factor of the losses.Step 3. Calculate the overall value of the alternative Yiby(2.3)Φ(Yi)=∑o=1mδ(Yi,Yo)−mini∑o=1mδ(Yi,Yo)maxi∑o=1mδ(Yi,Yo)−mini∑o=1mδ(Yi,Yo)Step 4. Select the most desirable alternative or rank all alternatives by the overall values Φ(Yi) (i=1, 2, …, m). The alternative with the maximum value is the most desirable one. Inversely, the alternative with the minimum value is the worst.Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), which was proposed by Yager [24,25], can be defined as follows:Definition 2.1[24]. Let X be an arbitrary non-empty set. A PFS P is a mathematical object of the form:(2.4)P={〈x,P(μP(x),νP(x))〉|x∈X}where μP(x), νP(x):X→[0, 1], such that (μP(x))2+(νP(x))2≤1, for every x∈X. μP(x) and νP(x) denote the membership degree and the non-membership degree of the element x to X in P, respectively. The hesitant degree of x∈X is expressed as:(2.5)πP(x)=1−μP2(x)−νP2(x)For convenience, Zhang and Xu [33] called β=P(μβ, νβ) a Pythagorean fuzzy number (PFN), which satisfies μβ, νβ∈[0, 1], and (μβ)2+(νβ)2≤1.Recently, Zhang and Xu [33] introduced some operations for PFNs:Definition 2.2[24,25,33]. Letβ1=P(μβ1,νβ1),β2=P(μβ2,νβ2)and β=P(μβ, νβ) be three PFNs, then(1)βc=P(νβ, μβ);β1⊕β2=P(μβ12+μβ22−μβ12μβ22,νβ1νβ2);β1⊗β2=P(μβ1μβ2,νβ12+νβ22−νβ12νβ22);λβ=P(1−(1−μβ2)λ,(νβ)λ),λ>0;βλ=P((μβ)λ,1−(1−νβ2)λ),λ>0.In order to rank the PFNs, Zhang and Xu [33] further gave a score function of the PFN:Definition 2.3[33]. Let β=P(μβ, νβ) be a PFN, then the score function of β is defined as:(2.6)s(β)=(μβ)2−(νβ)2The larger the score is, the better the PFN is.Before describing the Pythagorean Fuzzy TODIM approach in detail, we firstly give some fundamental concepts that are useful in this paper.By Definition 2.3, we know that the score function is efficient to compare the majority of PFNs. However, in some cases, this function is insufficient to indicate which PFN is better, for example, if β1=P(0.6, 0.6) and β2=P(0.3, 0.3), then s(β1)=s(β2)=0. More generally, if any PFN satisfies μβ=νβ, then its score is 0. But we know that these PFNs are possibly not the same. Motivated by the definition of the score function, an accuracy function for PFN can be defined as:Definition 3.1Let β=P(μβ, νβ) be a PFN, then the accuracy function of β is defined as:(3.1)h(β)=(μβ)2+(νβ)2Clearly, h(β)∈[0, 1]. In fact, 0≤h(β)=(μβ)2+(νβ)2≤1. The bigger value of h(β), the higher accuracy of the PFN β.From Eqs. (2.5), (2.6) and (3.1), we can getπβ2+h(β)=1. The lower hesitant degree makes the higher accuracy of the PFN β.Based on the score function and the accuracy function of PFNs, the ranking method for any two PFNs can be defined as:Definition 3.2Letβ1=P(μβ1,νβ1)andβ2=P(μβ2,νβ2)be two PFNs. s(βi)(i=1, 2) and h(βi)(i=1, 2) are the score values and the accuracy values of β1 and β2, respectively, then•If s(β1)<s(β2), then β1<β2;If s(β1)=s(β2), then(1)If h(β1)<h(β2), then β1<β2;If h(β1)=h(β2), then β1=β2;If h(β1)>h(β2), then β1>β2.In what follows, we define the Euclidean distance of PFNs which will be helpful later:Definition 3.3Letβ1=P(μβ1,νβ1)andβ2=P(μβ2,νβ2)be two PFNs. Then the Euclidean distance between β1 and β2 is:(3.2)d(β1,β2)=12((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+((πβ1)2−(πβ2)2)2We can use an example to illustrate the Euclidean distance measure: If β1=P(0.6, 0.3) and β2=P(0.5, 0.6) are two PFNs, then the hesitant degrees of β1 and β2 areπβ1(x)=1−(0.6)2−(0.3)2=0.7416,πβ2(x)=1−(0.5)2−(0.6)2=0.6245then the Euclidean distance between β1 and β2 is:d(β1,β2)=12((0.6)2−(0.5)2)2+((0.3)2−(0.6)2)2+((0.7416)2−(0.6245)2)2=0.2351Based on Definition 3.3, we can derive some properties of the Euclidean distance of two PFNs:Theorem 3.1Letβ1=P(μβ1,νβ1)andβ2=P(μβ2,νβ2)be two PFNs, then(1)d(β1, β2)=d(β2, β1);d(β1, β2)=0 only if β1=β2;0≤d(β1, β2)≤1.From Definition 2.1, we can obtainμβ1,νβ1,μβ2,νβ2∈[0,1],0≤(μβ1)2+(νβ1)2≤1, and0≤(μβ2)2+(νβ2)2≤1, then(1)d(β1,β2)=12[((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+((πβ1)2−(πβ2)2)2]=12[((μβ2)2−(μβ1)2)2+((νβ2)2−(νβ1)2)2+((πβ2)2−(πβ1)2)2]=d(β2,β1);Letd(β1,β2)=12[((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+((πβ1)2−(πβ2)2)2]=0, then we can get((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2=0,((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2=0and((πβ1)2−(πβ2)2)2=0, and thus,μβ1=μβ2,νβ1=νβ2andπβ1=πβ2;d(β1,β2)=12[((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+((πβ1)2−(πβ2)2)2]=12((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+(1−(μβ1)2−(νβ1)2−(1−(μβ2)2−(νβ2)2))2=12[((μβ1)2−(μβ2)2)2+((νβ1)2−(νβ2)2)2+([(μβ1)2−(μβ2)2]+[(νβ1)2−(νβ2)2])2]≤12[(μβ1)4+(νβ1)4+((μβ1)2+(νβ1)2)2]≤12[(μβ1)2+(νβ1)2+1]≤12(1+1)=1Now, let us discuss how to utilize the TODIM approach to handle the MCDM problem with Pythagorean fuzzy information. To elaborate it clearly, we give a brief description of the considered problems as follows:The MCDM problem with Pythagorean fuzzy information is to confirm the desirable choice from a set of alternatives which are evaluated based on a collection of criteria, where the evaluation values are PFNs given by the DMs. Then this type of problem can be described by mathematical symbols as follows:Let A={Ai|i∈M} be a finite set of alternatives and C={Cj|j∈N} be a set of criteria.w=(w1,w2,⋯,wn)Tis the weight vector of the criteria, wherewj∈{0,1}(j=1,2,…,n)and∑j=1nwj=1. The evaluation value over the alternative Aiwith respect to the criterion Cjis expressed as a PFN rij=P(μij, νij), where μijindicates the degree that the alternative Aisatisfies the criterion Cj, and νijexpresses the degree that the alternative Aidissatisfies the criterion Cj. As a consequence, the MCDM problem with PFNs can be compactly shown in the Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×nas:(3.3)To solve the MCDM problem with Pythagorean fuzzy information, we try to present a Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach, which is developed in terms of the prospect theory and can depict the DMs’ behaviours under risk. At the beginning, we consider to normalize information since there may be some benefit criteria and cost criteria in decision matrix. These two kinds of criteria react oppositely, that is to say, the larger value means the better performance of a benefit criterion but reflects the worse performance of a cost criterion. Thus, in order to guarantee all criteria are compatible, we proceed to transform the cost criteria into benefit criteria by the following formula:(3.4)lij=rij,for benefit criterionCj(rij)c,for cost criterionCjwhere (rij)c=P(νij, μij) is the complement of rij. By this way, we can obtain the normalized Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrixL=(lij)m×n.Next, we calculate the relative weight of each criterion Cjas:(3.5)wjr=wj/wr,j,r=1,2,…,nwherewjis the weight of the criterion Cj,wr=max{wj|j=1,2,…,n}, and0≤wjr≤1.With Eq. (3.5), we can derive the dominance degree of Aiover each alternative Atwith respect to the criterion Cj:(3.6)ϕj(Ai,At)=wjrd(lij,ltj)/∑j=1nwjr,iflij>ltj0,iflij=ltj−1θ∑j=1nwjrd(lij,ltj)/wjr,iflij<ltjwhere the parameter θ indicates the attenuation factor of the losses, and d(lij, ltj) is to measure the distance between the PFNs lijand ltjby Definition 3.3. If lij>ltj, then ϕj(Ai, At) signifies a gain; if lij<ltj, then ϕj(Ai, At) represents a loss.In order to show the function ϕj(Ai, At) visually, we express it in a dominance degree matrix with respect to the criterion Cjas:(3.7)based on which we can calculate the overall dominance degree of the alternative Aiover each alternative Ajby(3.8)δ(Ai,At)=∑j=1nϕj(Ai,At),(i,t=1,2,…,m)Therefore, by Eq. (3.8), the overall dominance degree matrix can be got as:(3.9)Finally, the overall value of each alternative Aican be derived by the following formula:(3.10)ξi=∑t=1mδ(Ai,At)−mini{∑t=1mδ(Ai,At)}maxi{∑t=1mδ(Ai,At)}−mini{∑t=1mδ(Ai,At)},i=1,2,…,mand the order of each alternative can be ranked by the principle, that is, the greater the overall value ξi, the better the alternative Ai.In general, Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach involves the following steps:Step 1. Identify the Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×ngiven by the DM in the MCDM problems, where rijis a PFN.Step 2. Transform the decision matrixR=(rij)m×ninto a normalized Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrixL=(lij)m×nby Eq. (3.4).Step 3. Calculate the relative weight of each criterion Cjusing Eq. (3.5).Step 4. Calculate the dominance degree of the alternative Aiover each alternative Atwith respect to the criterion Cjby Eq. (3.6).Step 5. Calculate the overall dominance degree of Aiover each alternative Atusing Eq. (3.8);Step 6. Derive the overall value of each alternative Aiusing Eq. (3.10);Step 7. Determine the ranking of the alternatives according to the overall values.If the MCDM problems are processed by several DMs, then we need to calculate the overall value of each alternative with respect to each DM's decision information following Steps 1–6, and aggregate the overall values of all alternatives according to the weights of the DMs. Finally, the ranking of the alternatives can be obtained.It is essential to specify that in the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach, the information in decision matrix is expressed by PFNs to represent the DMs’ opinions. Expressed by the membership degree and the non-membership degree, the PFNs are quite efficient to capture the imprecision and uncertainty of the DMs in the MCDM problem. Nevertheless, it is different from the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) since the PFNs can handle the decision making process in a larger area, where the membership degree and the non-membership degree satisfy that the sum of squares of them rather than the sum of them is less than or equal to 1. For example, when a DM needs to assess an objective with respect to an attribute, if he/she provides the membership degree and the non-membership degree as 0.7 and 0.5 respectively, then this information can only be handled by PFNs. In addition, the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach is a useful tool to deal with the decision making problems with PFNs allowing for the DMs’ psychological behaviours. But other approaches to solving the decision making problems with PFNs do not have this desirable characteristic.According to the above description, θ is the attenuation factor of the losses, which is determined by the DMs. Apparently, by giving a value of θ, the ranking results of the alternatives in the decision making problem can be obtained. It is worthwhile to point out that in a decision making process, different values of θ may lead to various ranking results. In the following, we will conduct the simulation tests to make sure how the values of θ impact the decision results of the MCDM problems.In the simulation process, we produce the MCDM problems with PFNs for 1000 times randomly. For these problems of six alternatives and six attributes, we take the values of θ from 1 to 2 by adding 0.01 for each round of simulation, and record the change of the ranking results. For any two simulations tests, if the ranking orders of the alternatives are different, then we consider that the results have changed. The simulation results are presented in Fig. 1. By the same way, we can get the results of varying θ from 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5, as shown in Figs. 2–4, respectively:In the above figures, the X-axle represents the 1000 decision making problems, and Y-axle indicates the times of changing the ranking results of the alternatives when θ varies in each problem. These four figures show the results of the simulations directly, which depict the times of changing the ranking results of the alternatives when θ varies from one to another. The four figures reflect the times of changing the ranking of the alternatives have a negative trend when the value of θ increases. The results fit Eq. (2), which indicates that the higher values of θ make the DMs more sensitive to losses. Moreover, in order to know how much the values of θ impact the times of changing the ranking of the alternatives, we transform these figures in the following chart:When θ varies from 1 to 2, Fig. 5depicts the ranking results of the alternatives in each MCDM problem, which change 0.289 times averagely. Similarly, when θ varies from 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, the ranking results change 0.265 times, 0.25 times and 0.21 times, respectively. Therefore, for the MCDM problems of six alternatives and six attributes, the average rates of the change are in the interval [20%, 30%] when θ varies. In addition, we conduct the same simulation tests for the MCDM problems of five alternatives and six attributes, seven alternatives and six attributes, five alternatives and five attributes, seven alternatives and seven attributes. All the results of the simulation tests indicate the ascending trend of the sensitivity of the DMs when θ ascends. Thus, if the DMs are easily impacted by the losses, then they should give a high value of θ in the decision making process. Moreover, we have obtained another conclusion that the times of the change are affected by the number of the alternatives. For the fixed attributes, more alternatives lead to more times of the change of the ranking results. In all MCDM problems above-mentioned, the average rates of the change grow when the number of the alternatives increases. They all vary in the interval [10%, 45%], and we can get that the more alternatives the problems are, the larger trend of the change.Kendall tau rank distance is to count the number of pairwise disagreements between two ranking orders. In this part, we use this metric to record the change of the ranking results of our simulation tests. Also, we take the MCDM problems of six alternatives and six attributes, and let θ vary from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5 by adding 0.01 for each round of simulation. The simulation results are shown in Figs. 6–9.The X-axle represents the 1000 decision making problems, and Y-axle denotes the ratio of pairwise disagreements between two ranking orders when θ varies in each problem. From these four figures we know that, in the MCDM problem of six attributes and six alternatives, the higher values of θ make the DMs more sensitive to losses. Furthermore, we have investigated the same simulation tests for the MCDM problems of five alternatives and six attributes, seven alternatives and six attributes, five alternatives and five attributes, seven alternatives and seven attributes. The results are shown in Table 1.It is easy to find that the higher the value of θ is, the more sensitive the DMs are. By using the Kendall tau rank distance to record the ratios of pairwise disagreements, we can get that more attributes lead to lower ratios of pairwise disagreement, which we cannot summarize from the general simulation tests. Nonetheless, there is no ascending trend of the ratio of pairwise disagreements when θ ascends.In this section, we provide an application which correlates with selecting the desirable objective to illustrate the implementation process of our approach.In recent years, Asian economy is the most potential economic area which is thirty percent of the global economy. However, with the limitation of the construction fund in Asia, the infrastructure in some countries is insufficient, such as railway, highway, port, airport, and so on. It has restricted the economic development of Asia area to some degree. For the sake of improving this situation, in 2013, the government of China proposed to establish an international financial institution: Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) [34], which aims to provide finance to infrastructure projects in the Asia Pacific region. Since it was initiated by China, it has aroused heated discussions all over the world. Some countries would like to join it, like Singapore, Pakistan, Kazakhstan etc., but some other countries reject it, such as the United States, Japan, etc. Until June 2015, 57 countries have joined the AIIB as Prospective Founding Members (PFMs).Based on some preparatory work, such as capital determination, applying for loan, confirming the PFMs, AIIB makes further efforts in various fields. An issue, which has got great attention from the entire world, is the election of the governor of AIIB, which conforms to a MCDM problem. In the following, we consider this issue in the MCDM circumstance, and simulate a decision making process of this election issue.Up to now, some scholars have proposed that the governor of AIIB should be selected according to the following criteria: (1) the degree of familiarity of politics and international affairs; (2) management skill; (3) the capacity of communicating with national leaders; (4) the capacity of establishing stable financial mechanisms. There exists some approaches for determining the criteria weights, such as entropy based approach [35], maximizing deviations approach [36,37], comparisons matrix approach [38], maximizing variances approach [39] and so on. However, for simplicity, the criteria weights are discussed by three DMs of this MCDM problem. We denote these four criteria as Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) respectively, and their weight vector isw=(0.4,0.2,0.15,0.25)T, which is given by the DMs. Without loss of generality, here we suppose that the three DMs have the same weights. In the simulation process, we suppose that there are five candidates to be chosen, denoted as Ai(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Considering the criteria are impacted by various factors, and the crisp numbers are not enough to assess the candidates. For example, if a candidate has participated in establishing financial mechanism, and this mechanism apparently cannot be error-free, but we can know that it operates well in some aspects. Under such circumstance, the PFNs are effective to depict the good and bad aspects of the criteria, so do others. Therefore, the PFNsrij⁡=P(μij,vij)(i=1,2,3,4,5;j=1,2,3,4)are used in the decision making process, which are provided by the DMs.rij(k)(i=1,2,3,4,5;j=1,2,3,4;k=1,2,3)indicate the criteria values over the candidates Ai(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with respect to the criteria Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4), given by the DMs Dk(k=1, 2, 3). All these criteria values are contained in the decision matrixR(k)=(rij(k))5×4, as shown in Tables 2–4:As we have mentioned before, the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach is effective to handle the decision making problems with PFNs, which considers the DMs’ psychological behaviours. Now, we take advantage of the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach to simulate the decision making process.Firstly, sincew1=max{w1,w2,w3,w4}, then C1 is the reference criterion and the reference weight iswr=0.4. Therefore, the relative weights of all the criteria Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) arew1r=1,w2r=0.5,w3r=0.375andw4r=0.625, respectively. Then, we need to calculate the dominance degree of the candidate Aiover each candidate Atwith respect to the criterion Cj. Here we take an example from the information given by the first DM. Let θ=2.5, then the dominance degree matrices with respect to the criteria Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) are:Secondly, the overall dominance degree of the candidate Aiover each candidate Atcan be obtained by Eq. (3.8), and the overall dominance degree matrix is:Then, we calculate the candidates’ overall values of the first DM by Eq. (3.10). In the same manner, the candidates’ overall values of other DMs can be obtained. The results ξ(k) (k=1, 2, 3) are shown in Table 5:For the same weight of the DMs, the overall values of the candidates A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 can be got as 0.5962, 0.7523, 0.1441, 0.5811, 0.6009, respectively. Thus, the ranking of the candidates is A2≻A5≻A1≻A4≻A3, and A2 is the optimal choice of the desirable governor of AIIB.In what follows, we compare the Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach [33], the fuzzy TODIM approach [32], the intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM approach [32] and the proposed approach.These two approaches are valid to solve the MCDM problems, but it is necessary to point out that the Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach cannot depict the DMs’ psychological behaviours. With the same background and parameters in the last subsection, the Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS process [33] is described as follows:The first step is to identify the Pythagorean fuzzy positive ideal solution (PIS) and the Pythagorean fuzzy negative ideal solution (NIS) of the decision matrices by the following formulas [33]:PIS(k)={Cj(k),maxi〈s(Cj(k)(xi))〉|j=1,2,3,4;k=1,2,3}={〈C1(k),P(μ1+,ν1+)〉,〈C2(k),P(μ2+,ν2+)〉,⋯,〈C4(k),P(μn+,νn+)〉}andNIS(k)={Cj(k),mini〈s(Cj(k)(xi))〉|j=1,2,3,4;k=1,2,3}={〈C1(k),P(μ1−,ν1−)〉,〈C2(k),P(μ2−,ν2−)〉,…,〈C4(k),P(μn−,νn−)〉}For example, for the information given by the first DM, the Pythagorean fuzzy PIS and the Pythagorean fuzzy NIS of the election issue are:PIS(1)={P(0.8,0.5),P(0.7,0.3),P(0.8,0.3),P(0.8,0.3)}andNIS(1)={P(0.5,0.2),P(0.6,0.4),P(0.6,0.3),P(0.5,0.3)}The next step is to calculate the distance between the candidate Aiand the Pythagorean fuzzy PIS in each matrix byd(Ai(k),PIS(k))=∑j=14wjd(Cj(k)(Ai),Cj(k)(PIS)), in the same manner, the distance between the candidate Aiand the Pythagorean fuzzy NIS isd(Ai(k),NIS(k))=∑j=14wjd(Cj(k)(Ai),Cj(k)(NIS)), whered(Cj(k)(Ai),Cj(k)(PIS))andd(Cj(k)(Ai),Cj(k)(NIS))are obtained by Eq. (3.2).Based on the results above, the last step of the Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach is to calculate the relative closeness index in each decision matrix byξ(k)(Ai)=d(Ai(k),NIS(k))dmax(Ai(k),NIS(k))−d(Ai(k),PIS(k))dmin(Ai(k),PIS(k))wheredmax(Ai(k),NIS(k))=max1≤i≤md(Ai(k),NIS(k))anddmin(Ai(k),PIS(k))=min1≤i≤md(Ai(k),PIS(k)). Then for the same weight of the DMs, we can get the overall relative closeness index ξ(Ai) of each candidate, as shown in Table 4. The bigger ξ(Ai) is, the better the candidate Aiis, and the most desirable candidate is A4.By Tables 5 and 6, we can know that the ranking results of the candidates got by the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach and the Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach are distinctly different, where the optimal choice derived by Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach is A2, but the most desirable candidate got by Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach is A4. Essentially, these two approaches are discrepant at the consideration of the DMs’ psychological behaviours. The Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS approach can only be used in the situations where the DMs are entirely rational. However, in practice, for the incomplete information or some other factors, the DMs usually cannot provide the accurate preferences. In other words, the DMs are not rational to some degree. The Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach can reasonably depict the DMs’ psychological behaviours under risk, and thus, it may deal with the above issue effectively.The fuzzy TODIM approach [32] is available to solve the MCDM problems, which also can depict the DMs’ psychological behaviours. But it is worth to say that the fuzzy TODIM approach only can portray the things by the membership degrees. Then, by the information of the decision matrices, the decision making process can be described as:Firstly, we obtain the relative weights by Eq. (3.5). Here, the relative weights of all the criteria Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4)) arew1r=1,w2r=0.5,w3r=0.375andw4r=0.625respectively, which are the same as the relative weights derived by Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM.Secondly, we calculate the dominance of the candidate Aiover each candidate Ataccording to the kth DM's opinions by:o(k)(Ai,At)=∑j=14φj(Ai(k),At(k)),i,t=1,2,3,4,5;k=1,2,3whereφj(Ai(k),At(k))=wjr(xij(k)−xtj(k))/∑j=14wjr,if(xij(k)−xtj(k))>00,if(xij(k)−xtj(k))=0−1θ∑j=14wjr(xtj(k)−xij(k))/wjr,if(v)<0In the above equations, the valuesxij(k)andxtj(k)are the membership degrees of the PFNs in the decision matrices R(k) (k=1, 2, 3), which indicates the rating of the candidates i and t with the respect to the criterion Cj.Thirdly, we calculate the global value of the candidate i of each DM byςi(k)=∑t=15o(k)(Ai,At)−mint∑t=15o(k)(Ai,At)maxt∑t=15o(k)(Ai,At)−mint∑t=15o(k)(Ai,At),i=1,2,3,4,5;k=1,2,3Finally, according to the same weight of the DMs, we can aggregate the global values of the candidates i (i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) by averaging the global values of the DMs. Using the information in Tables 2–4, the results derived by the fuzzy TODIM approach for the candidates can be listed in Table 7:From the results of the candidates in Table 7, we can get that A4 is the most desirable choice of the governor of AIIB. By the results of the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach, the candidate A2 is the best one. The different results are caused by the different information given by the DMs. The fuzzy numbers are able to express the indeterminacy of the DMs. However, due to the complexity of the things and the incomplete knowledge of the DMs, the DMs are usually difficult to provide a fuzzy value to judge the things. But fuzzy intervals are much easier for them to determine, which can be considered as the PFNs. For example, if a DM assesses an objective as [0.6, 0.8], then it means the good performance degree of the objective is 0.6, and the poor performance degree of the objective is1−0.82=0.6. Thus, the PFNs are stronger to deal with uncertain decision making problems.The IFNs and the PFNs can portray the uncertain things from the membership degrees and the non-membership degrees. They provide an effective tool to express the indeterminacy of the DMs. On the one hand, as mentioned before, the PFNs and the IFNs can be transferred by the fuzzy intervals, which are more scientific and practical for our human beings to handle uncertain decision making problems. On the other hand, by judging the things from the good, bad and hesitant aspects, these two kinds of fuzzy numbers can reflect the cognitions of the DMs precisely. However, unlike the PFNs, the IFNs are not useable in some cases. The IFNs must satisfy that the sum of the membership degree and the non-membership degree belongs to [0,1]. Thus, in our case analysis, there exists some numbers which IFNs cannot deal with. For example, the first DM gives the membership degree and the non-membership degree of the candidate A1 with respect to criterion C3 as 0.8 and 0.3, respectively. Then the sum of 0.8 and 0.3 is greater than 1. But this order is valid in PFNs for 0.82+0.32=0.73<1. In summary, the PFNs have stronger ability to process information in MCDM.The TODIM approach, which is developed on the basis of the prospect theory, can successfully describe the DMs’ psychological behaviours under risk, while the PFS is an effective mathematical approach of depicting uncertainty. In this paper, we have developed the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach, which is useful to cope with the MCDM problems that consider the DMs’ psychological behaviours in uncertain circumstance. The simulation tests have been conducted to analyze how the risk attitude exerts an influence on the results of the MCDM problems. Last but not least, we have applied the Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM approach to a case study concerning the selection of the governor of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has shown the applicability and the implementations of our approach.For the incomplete information and revenue uncertainty in our management and finance areas, there is urgent need about the approaches to solve the related MCDM problems. To this end, the paper has provided an effective approach to handle the MCDM problems in this complex world, which not only can represent the uncertainty, but also can portray the psychological behaviours of the DMs under risk. In further research, the qualitative and quantitative information will be discussed in the approach, which also can depict the uncertainty and risk.
