@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a new set of speech features called Locally-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (LNCC) that are based on Seneff's Generalized Synchrony Detector (GSD). First, an analysis of the GSD frequency response is provided to show that it generates spurious peaks at harmonics of the detected frequency. Then, the GSD frequency response is modeled as a quotient of two filters centered at the detected frequency. The numerator is a triangular band pass filter centered around a particular frequency similar to the ordinary Mel filters. The denominator term is a filter that responds maximally to frequency components on either side of the numerator filter. As a result, a local normalization is performed without the spurious peaks of the original GSD. Speaker verification results demonstrate that the proposed LNCC features are of low computational complexity and far more effectively compensate for spectral tilt than ordinary MFCC coefficients. LNCC features do not require the computation and storage of a moving average of the feature values, and they provide relative reductions in Equal Error Rate (EER) as high as 47.7%, 34.0% or 25.8% when compared with MFCC, MFCC+CMN, or MFCC+RASTA in one case of variable spectral tilt, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a perceptually-motivated and extremely simple but effective way to normalize speech features instantaneously is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed features has been demonstrated for a speaker verification task across a wide variety of linear channel conditions.With a constant −9dB/octave spectral tilt, the proposed Locally-Normalized Cepstral Coefficients give a dramatic reduction in EER as high as 51.0% when compared with ordinary MFCCs, and the reductions were as high as 47.7%, 34.0% or 25.8% when compared with MFCC, MFCC+CMN or MFCC+RASTA under one of the variable spectral tilt conditions (STEP_tilt_3, −9dB/octave).While CMN and RASTA do further improve the performance of LNCC in most cases, achieving relative reductions of 30% in some conditions, they do not provide improvements that are quite as dramatic as when they are used in conjunction with MFCC coefficients.We conclude that the proposed LNCC features are an attractive alternative to MFCC or MFCC+CMN in any situation where it is difficult to estimate the cepstral means accurately. Other application scenarios might include those where very low latency or low complexity is desired, in which computing and storing the moving average required by CMN may be inconvenient. Because all processing in LNCC is performed independently within each frame and no information needs to be exchanged between frames, it is also amenable to simple parallel implementations.In future work we plan to evaluate the proposed features for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, although it is possible that the self-normalizing filterbank may remove a small amount of phonetic information along with the channel information, so some modifications may be necessary to limit the amount of normalization that is performed. Another obvious line of investigation would be to combine LNCCs with MFCCs or PLPs using either feature combination or system combination. The effect of unknown linear filtering associated with LNCC is more complex than the low frequency additive constant that is addressed by CMN and RASTA for MFCC, and needs to be modeled; alternatively, multi-frame normalization schemes may also need to be developed for LNCC. Finally, we plan to compare the proposed features with the baselines using even shorter utterances for speaker verification.
