@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this article, we investigate the performance of a coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multi-carrier (MC) system in underwater communication, where acoustic interference and ambient noise are the two major channel impairments. The channel model considered in this work is based on the shallow water model that has eleven paths. In our work, the acoustic signal is spread with the aid of a high rate spreading sequence to alleviate the effects of acoustic interference. At the receiver, non-linear detectors based on Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) are employed for signal detection. The simulation results reveal that the system under consideration with the MMSE detector provides better performance in terms of the achievable bit error rate than the system with the ZF detector while achieving higher data rates.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The transmission of information in underwater communication is a challenging issue because it is affected by noise from various sources that include man-made noise (shipping) and natural noise (rain, wind and seismic). Further, multipath propagation and acoustic interference have great impact on the signal transmission in underwater communication. Due to multipath propagation, signals in underwater channels experience inter-symbol interference (ISI). In a typical radio frequency (RF) communication orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely employed to combat the effects of ISI, because OFDM obviates the need for complex equalization techniques. In addition, OFDM can be called upon to deal with the effects of ISI in underwater communication. Of late, in RF communication, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system has been employed to increase the capacity of the wireless channels. The information theoretic capacity of the MIMO system increases linearly with an increase in the number of antennas. This increase in capacity is achieved without calling for additional bandwidth and power. That is, MIMO can be operated in a spatial multiplexing mode to achieve higher data rates. This benefit offered by the MIMO system can also be exploited in underwater communication. Hence, in this article, we consider an MIMO–OFDM system aided by turbo code for the transmission of signals over underwater channels.Recently, underwater communication has received substantial attention in both the academia and industry because it offers a wide range of interesting research problems that need to be addressed, for example, acoustic channel modeling and ambient noise modeling. In [1] the author presented various sources that contribute to acoustic noise and demonstrated their spectrum. It is also shown that there is a linear relationship between the noise spectrum and wind speed. In addition, it is reported that there is a correlation between wind speed and noise level. In [2], time-domain modeling of turbo coded underwater communication that achieves a better bit error rate (BER) performance has been addressed. In [3], Karasalo investigated the performance of a single-carrier turbo coded system for underwater communication with the aid of time-domain ray-tracing modeling. The author also considered that the OFDM symbol duration is longer than the multipath spread to overcome the effects of ISI in underwater communication. In [4], Akyildiz and his team discussed different architectures for an underwater sensor network and highlighted the research challenges. In [5], Wang et al., proposed a stratified acoustic model based on frequency-dependent geometrical ray tracing to determine the phase shifts in underwater acoustic networks and proposed that it is possible to predict the transmission loss with fewer computations.In this article, we consider a system that combines OFDM and MIMO and exploit the advantages of an iterative decoding algorithm for underwater communication and investigate its performance in terms of the achievable BER. To be specific, we investigate the BER performance of our considered system in the context of underwater communication by employing non-linear detectors such as Zero-Forcing–Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (ZF–OSIC) and Minimum-Mean-Square-Error–Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (MMSE–OSIC) at the receiver to combat the effects of acoustic interference.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system configuration. Section 3 gives the essence of symbol detection techniques. Section 4 elucidates the performance results and discussion. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.Figs. 1 and 2illustrate the multipath propagation in underwater communication and the transmitter–receiver schematic, respectively. The multipath scenario considered in this work exhibits rich scattering.In the considered transmitter–receiver structure, we assume that the transmitter is equipped with Nttransmit antennas and that each of the receivers is equipped with Nrreceiving antennas.Let the bit stream corresponding to the kth transmitter be represented byuk, whereuk∈[-1,1]. After channel encoding and modulation, let the transmitted symbols by the kth transmitter be expressed as(1)sk=[sk1,sk2,…,skm]T,k=1,2,…,Kwhere m represents the number of bits corresponding to the kth transmitter.Now,skj,j=1,2,3,…,mis spread with the aid of the N-length random spreading sequenceckgiven by(2)ck=1N[ck0,ck1,…,ck(N-1)]TThen, in the context of m bits, theNm×mdimensional spreading matrix can be expressed as,(3)Ck=diag{ck,ck,…,ck}=Im⊗ck,k=1,2,…,KAfter spreading, the Nm-length symbol vector corresponding to the kth transmitter can be expressed asx=Cksk. The spreaded symbols are multi-carrier (MC) modulated by invoking theN‾×N‾dimensional MC modulation matrixF‾given by(4)F‾={exp(j2πf1t),exp(j2πf2t),…,exp(j2πfN‾t)}Finally, the cyclic prefix is added to mitigate the effects of inter-carrier interference and is then transmitted from the antennas. Suppose, we assume that the sub-carriers experience flat fading, then the channel state information (CSI) vector connecting the ith transmit antenna and the jth receive antenna can be expressed as(5)hji=[h1,h2,…,hNm]However, in this contribution, we investigate the performance of the considered system in a frequency-selective underwater communication channel by invoking a realistic channel model detailed in [6,7]. Hence, in this context, the fading coefficient connecting the ith transmit antenna and the jth receive antenna can be expressed as(6)hji(t)=∑p=1Phjip∂(t-τl)wherehjipis a complex zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance ψ(τp) and P defines the number of taps connecting a transmit and receive antenna. Additionally, the channel model parameters are detailed in Table 1.Now, the CSI connecting all transmit antennas and the jth receive antenna of the receiver can be expressed as(7)hj=[hj1,hj2,…,hjNt];j=1,2,…,NrExplicitly, the receive vector in the case of Nrreceive antennas can then be conveniently expressed as(8)r=HFd¯+ηwhere(9)H=hj1....hjNt..................hNr1....hNrNt(10)d=d¯1d¯2d¯3d¯4withd¯i=[d¯1,d¯2,d¯3,…,d¯Nm],i=1,2,…,Nt. Additionally,F‾in (8) is defined in (4). Assuming that all of the sub-carriers are perfectly orthogonal to each other, the received vector after MC demodulation can be expressed as(11)r¯=H¯d¯+η¯wherer¯is theNr×1component receive vector,H‾is theNr×Ntcomponent channel matrix andη¯is the ambient noise. We have modeled the noise component using the basic noise sources that includes shipping noise, turbulence noise, sea state noise and thermal noise [8].Shipping noise:(12)NLship=40+20(s-0.5)+26log(f)-60log(f+0.03)Turbulence noise:(13)NLTurb=17-30log(f)Sea state noise:(14)NLState=50+7.5w1/2+20log(f)-40log(f+0.4)Thermal noise:(15)NLThermal=-15+20log(f)Hence,(16)η¯=NLShip+NLTurb+NLState+NLThermalAt the receiver, we employ the ZF–OSIC detection algorithm to detect the symbols. In ZF–OSIC, a set of all possible symbol decisions is ranked according to the pre-computation of weight vectors [9,10]. Throughout this article,(·)+represents the Moore–Penrose pseudo inverse,(·)zidenotes the sub-matrix formed by choosing a row matrix zi, (⋅)Hindicates the Hermitian transpose and (⋅)−1 indicates the inverse. It is assumed that the perfect CSI is available at the receiver.Assuming the input–output relationship of the MIMO–OFDM system as(17)r¯=H‾d¯+η¯The algorithm can be described as followsInitialize:(18)i←1(19)G‾i=H‾i+(20)zi=argmin‖G‾i‖Recursion(21)Wzi=(G‾i)zi(22)x¯zi=(W‾)zir¯i(23)d¯̂zi=Q(x¯zi)(24)r¯i+1=r¯i-d¯̂zi(H‾)zi(25)W‾i+1=H‾zi+(26)i=i+1where Q(·) represents the quantization operation, which takes the argument to the nearest constellation.The MMSE–OSIC algorithm is a variant of the ZF–OSIC algorithm. Here, the ambient noise variance is also considered [10] and hence MMSE–OSIC suppresses the ambient noise in addition to acoustic interference. The weight matrix in this case can be expressed as(27)W‾=(H‾HH‾+σ2INt)-1H‾H(28)i=1Recursion(29)zi=argmin‖(W‾i)‖(30)Yzi=(W‾i)zir¯i(31)d¯̂zi=Q(Yzi)(32)r¯i+1=r¯i-d¯̂zi(H)zi(33)W‾i+1=(H‾ziHH‾zi+σ2INt)-1HziH(34)i=i+1The detected acoustic information is de-spread by the transmitter-specific spreading sequence and is de-interleaved and decoded by the turbo decoder based on the Log-MAP decoding algorithm [11]. Finally, the acoustic data are estimated.
