@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes based on visual cryptography (VC) or random grids (RGs) have been proposed in the past decade with the advantages of easy implementation, efficiency secret recovering and perfect security. As the concept of multiple secret images has gained more and more attention in academia, the novel concept of VC-based VSS with cyclic access structure has been discussed recently, which is a special case of multiple VSS, allowing participants to reconstruct the secret with the one next or last to him/her in a cyclic order. To obtain the benefit of RG-based VSS compared with VC-based VSS, this paper proposes the new VSS scheme with cyclic access structure for multiple secret images by random grids. The experimental results and theoretical security analysis demonstrate the feasibility.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As cryptosystems such as DES, AES, and RSA [1] kept computational security, secret sharing is a well-known security system with perfect secrecy. Visual secret sharing (VSS) [2–11,17,18] applies one of the two main techniques: visual cryptography (VC) first proposed by Naor and Shamir [2] and random grids (RGs) by Kafri and Keren [3]. VSS schemes come to security research with the advantages such as easy implementation, efficiency in recovering the secret, no need of cryptographic knowledge and perfect security.Generally speaking, VC-based VSS techniques often suffer from the problem of pixel expansion and the need of maintaining tailor-made codebook [4–11,18] while the RG-based VSS technique has no such weaknesses [12–14]. Thus it is advised to develop the RG-based VSS techniques.In the literature, some milestones of RG-based VSS should be highlight to reveal the situation that there is much attention to pay in academia. In 2007, Shyu [12] proposed the new RG-based VSS schemes to encode both gray-level and color images. Shyu [13] and Chen and Tsao [14] proposed their own (2, n) and (n, n) RG-based VSS schemes.In this paper, we consider a possible cyclic access structure under multiple participant condition for visual secret sharing. For n participants {P1,P2,…,Pn}, each Pk, where k∊{1,2,…,n}, can only reconstruct the secret image by using his/her own share image with the participant’s index being next or last (Pk−1 or Pk+1 if k−1=0, then take n; and if k+1=n+1, take 1). Otherwise, (s)he reconstructs nothing with any other participant. The concept of VSS with cyclic access structure is illustrated in Fig. 1. Therefore, the system totally has n secret images and n share images if there are n participants. This scheme can be adopted in the scenario in which the two predefined participants are assigned to share a secret, a cryptographic key for example, or these two participants need to authenticate each other.Although there have been only few VSS schemes [15,16] with cyclic access structure so far, the presented schemes are based on visual cryptography (VC) technique; they still have above-mentioned weaknesses while the secret number n is limited to be even. In this paper, a new RG-based VSS scheme is presented to remove the drawbacks from VC-based while inheriting all its advantages. It is worthwhile to note that the limitation of even-numbered secrets is removed.In the presented cyclic access structure, one generated random-grid must be stacked with the former to reveal one secret and stacked with next to reveal another secret. Thus, the main idea is to assign one half of pixels on a random-grid to encode one secret image and the other half for another secret image. The concept of referring is shown in Fig. 2.In the proposed scheme, there are two cases taken into account due to the number of secrets. With even-numbered secrets, the values of a half of grid-pixels in i-th (i being odd) random-grid are generated randomly. Then, the generated grid-pixels in i-th random-grid are used to generate half of grid-pixels in the next (i+1)-th random-grid by referring to the corresponding i-th secret image. Likewise, with odd-numbered secrets, the same operations are performed except some grid-pixels of each random-grid are randomly determined by referring to neither the former random-grid nor the next. The concept is shown in Fig. 3.As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, it is obvious that between any two nonadjacent random-grids, no referencing relation exists with respect to any secret image. It implies that two nonadjacent random-grids cannot reconstruct any secret image.Before describing the details of the proposed scheme, the notations used in the rest of paper are defined first.n: the number of secret images, random-grids and participants.w: the width of secret images and random-grids.h: the height of secret images and random-grids.Sm[i,j]: the value of pixel with position (i,j) in some secret image Sm, and Sm[i,j]∊{0,1}.Gm[i,j]: the value of pixel with position (i,j) in some share image Gm, and Gm[i,j]∊{0,1}.RSm[i,j]: reconstructed pixel value by processing OR operation with Gm[i,j] and G(m+1)modn[i,j].m=0,1,2,…,n-1,0⩽i⩽(w-1),0⩽j⩽(h-1)(0 presents the white pixel, and 1 is black one.).Case 1: nis even,n⩾4Step 1.1For a grid-pixel, choose a number m∊{0,1,…,n−1} and do the following operations.The value 0 or 1 of G(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j] is randomly determined, and G(m+2⋅k+1)(modn)[i,j] is decided by referring to G(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j] and S(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j], wherek=0,1,2,…,⌊n-22⌋. And the referencing relation is defined as if S(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j]=0,G(m+2·k+1)(modn)[i,j]=0ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=01ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=1; otherwise,G(m+2·k+1)(modn)[i,j]=0ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=11ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=0.Repeat Steps 1.1 and 1.2 until all grid-pixels of random-grids are determined.When n is even, it is found that each grid-pixel of all random-grids is generated under two conditions. Hence, an example of n=4 is given in Fig. 4to illustrate the concept of design. For each random-grid, half of grid-pixels are correlated with the former random-grid and the secret image, and the rest grid-pixels are with the next random-grid and the secret image.Case 2: nis odd,n⩾3Step 2.1For a grid-pixel, choose a number m∊{0,1,…,n−1} and do the following operations.The value 0 or 1 of G(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j] is randomly determined, and G(m+2⋅k+1)(modn)[i,j] is decided by referring to G(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j] and S(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j], wherek=0,1,2,…,⌊n-32⌋. And the referencing relation is defined as if S(m+2⋅k)(modn)[i,j]=0,G(m+2·k+1)(modn)[i,j]=0ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=01ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=1, otherwise,G(m+2·k+1)(modn)[i,j]=0ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=11ifG(m+2·k)(modn)[i,j]=0. The remaining grid-pixelG(m+n-1)(modn)[i,j]is randomly determined.Repeat Steps 2.1 and 2.2 until all grid-pixels of random-grids are determined.When n is odd, the remaining grid-pixel G(m+n−1)(modn)[i,j] in Step 2.2 may exist in one of n random-grids. An example of n=3 is given in Fig. 5to illustrate the concept of design. For each random-grid, it has thatn-12nh×wgrid-pixels related with the former random-grid and the secret image, andn-12nh×wgrid-pixels related with the next random-grid and the secret image. The rest1nh×wgrid-pixels are independent of all random-grids and secret images.The encoding algorithm of the proposed scheme is illustrated as follows.Input: secret imagesSm={Sm[i,j]|Sm[i,j]∈{0,1},0⩽i⩽(w-1),0⩽j⩽(h-1)},m=0,1,2,…,n-1Output: share imagesGm={Gm[i,j]|Gm[i,j]∈{0,1},0⩽i⩽(w-1),0⩽j⩽(h-1)},m=0,1,2,…,n-1fori=0 tow−1forj=0 toh−1m=random(0,n−1)//random (a,b) is the function which randomly outputs an integer from interval [a,b]forcount=0 ton−1ifcount is evenGm[i,j]=random(0,1)else ifSk[i,j]==1Gm[i,j]=(Gk[i,j]+1)mod2elseGm[i,j]=Gk[i,j]end of ifk=mm=(m+1)mod nend of for countend of for jend of for iTo disclose a secret Si, the decoding process directly stacks two adjacent random-grids Giand G(i+1)(modn) to reconstruct the stacked result which is visually recognizable.In such a way, two predefined participants, say Piand P(i+1)modn, could share one secret assigned by the dealer. Any other pair of participants cannot reveal this secret.In this section, the analysis of security and visual quality of the proposed scheme is illustrated. First of all, some definitions are given. Light transmission is defined to measure the lightness of area. And contrast is defined to measure two areas’ difference degree in visual with light transmissions.Definition 1. (Average light transmission)For a binary imageX={X[i,j]|X[i,j]∈{0,1},0⩽i⩽(w-1),0⩽j⩽(h-1)}, the light transmission of X[i,j] is defined ast[X[i,j]]=0ifX[i,j]=11ifX[i,j]=0. Then the average light transmission of X is denotedasT[X]=1w×h∑i=0w-1∑j=0h-1t[X[i,j]], whereT[X]∈[0,1].■Definition 2. (Contrast)The reconstructed secret image RSmis generated by stacking random-grids Gmand G(m+1)modn, where m=0,1,2,…,n−1, and its original secret image is Sm. The area of RSmcorresponding to white pixels in the original secret image Smis denotedasRSm(0). On the other hand, RSm(1) presents the area corresponding to black pixels in Sm. Then the contrast is defined asσ=T[RSm(0)]-T[RSm(1)]1+T[RSm(1)]. As a result of that T[RSm(0)]∊[0,1] and T[RSm(1)]∊[0,1], the contrast σ∊[−1,1], and there are three cases of visual results accordingly.Case 1.σ∊(0,1] means T[RSm(0)]>T[RSm(1)], so that the area RSm(1) is visually darker than RSm(0). Thus, we can distinguish the secret information in RSm.σ∊[−1,0) means T[RSm(0)]<T[RSm(1)], so that the area RSm(0) is visually darker than RSm(1). The result is visually opposite compared with Case 1, so that we can also distinguish the secret information in RSm.σ=0 means T[RSm(0)]=T[RSm(1)], so that we cannot tell the difference between RSm(0) and RSm(1). In other words, RSmis meaningless so that we cannot read the secret information■Hence, a successful secret image reconstruction happens in either Case 1 or Case 2, i.e. σ∊[−1,1]/{0}.The security of the proposed cyclic VSS scheme is defined and demonstrated as follows. The security of 2-out-of-2 VSS is defined as that a random-grid alone reveals no information about the secret and the secret can be reconstructed upon two random-girds stacked. Since the random-grid is noise-like, it is meaningless for human beings.Proposition 1. (Security of random-grids)Any random-grid reveals no information about the secrets.Proof.Case 1: nis even,n⩾4For any random-grid Gm, there are one half of grid-pixels, denoted asGm1/2,which are randomly chosen with probability12of white pixel, no matter the corresponding pixels in secret imageSm1/2are blackSm1/2(1)or whiteSm1/2(0)(shown in Fig. 3). Hence, the average light transmissions in bothGm1/2[Sm1/2(1)]andGm1/2[Sm1/2(0)]can be computed byT[Gm1/2[Sm1/2(1)]]=1|Sm1/2(1)|∑i=1|Sm1/2(1)|12=12andT[Gm1/2[Sm1/2(0)]]=1|Sm1/2(0)|∑i=1|Sm1/2(0)|12=12, where|Sm1/2(1)|(resp.|Sm1/2(0)|) is the number of grid-pixels inSm1/2(1)(resp.Sm1/2(0)) and|Sm1/2(1)|+|Sm1/2(0)|=12w×h. Then, the contrast ofGm1/2isσ=T[Gm1/2[Sm1/2(0)]]-T[Gm1/2[Sm1/2(1)]]1+T[Gm1/2[Sm1/2(1)]]=0such that it implies that the areaGm1/2reveals no secret information.The rest grid-pixels, denoted asG̃m1/2(G̃m1/2∪Gm1/2=Gm), are generated by referring toGm-11/2andSm-11/2. If the corresponding pixels inSm-11/2are whiteSm-11/2(0), the values of the grid-pixels inG̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(0)]are the same with those inGm-11/2[Sm-11/2(0)].Since the grid-pixels inGm-11/2are randomly chosen, the average light transmission ofG̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(0)]is computed byT[G̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(0)]]=1|Sm-11/2(0)|∑i=1|Sm-11/2(0)|12=12. If the secret pixels inSm-11/2are blackSm-11/2(1), the values of the corresponding grid-pixels inG̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(1)]are complementary to those inGm-11/2[Sm-11/2(1)]. The average light transmission ofG̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(1)]is computed byT[G̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(1)]]=1|Sm-11/2(1)|∑i=1|Sm-11/2(1)|1-12=12. Then the contrast ofG̃m1/2isσ=T[G̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(0)]]-T[G̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(1)]]1+T[G̃m1/2[Sm-11/2(1)]]=0. Thus, the areaG̃m1/2is noise-like and reveals no information of secret.To sum up, Gm, includingGm1/2andG̃m1/2, does not reveal any secret information.Case 2: nis odd,n⩾3For any random-grid Gm, there are1n+n-12n×h×wgrid-pixels, denoted asGm(n+1)/2n, which are randomly chosen with probability12of white pixels, no matter the corresponding pixels in secret imageSm(n+1)/2nare blackSm(n+1)/2n(1)or whiteSm(n+1)/2n(0)(shown in Fig. 5). Hence, the average light transmissions in both ofGm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(1)]andGm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(0)]are computed byT[Gm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(1)]]=1|Sm(n+1)/2n(1)|∑i=1|Sm(n+1)/2n(1)|12=12andT[Gm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(0)]]=1|Sm(n+1)/2n(0)|∑i=1|Sm(n+1)/2n(0)|12=12, where|Sm(n+1)/2n(1)|(resp.|Sm(n+1)/2n(0)|) is the number of grid-pixels inSm(n+1)/2n(1)(resp.Sm(n+1)/2n(0)) and|Sm(n+1)/2n(1)|+|Sm(n+1)/2n(0)|=(n+1)2nw×h. Then the contrast ofGm(n+1)/2nisσ=T[Gm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(0)]]-T[Gm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(1)]]1+T[Gm(n+1)/2n[Sm(n+1)/2n(1)]]=0. The areaGm(n+1)/2nreveals no secret information.The rest grid-pixels, denoted asG̃m(n-1)/2n, are generated by referring toGm-1(n-1)/2nandSm-1(n-1)/2n. If the secret pixels inSm-1(n-1)/2nare whiteSm-1(n-1)/2n(0), the corresponding grid-pixels inG̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)]are the same as those inGm-1(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)].Since the grid-pixels inGm-1(n-1)/2nare randomly chosen, the average light transmission ofG̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)]is computed byT[G̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)]]=1|Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)|∑i=1|Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)|12=12. If the secret pixels inSm-1(n-1)/2nare black, the grid-pixels ofG̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]are complementary toGm-1(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]. The average light transmission ofG̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]is computed byT[G̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]]=1|Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)|∑i=1|Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)|1-12=12. Then the contrast ofG̃m(n-1)/2nisσ=T[G̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(0)]]-T[G̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]]1+T[G̃m(n-1)/2n[Sm-1(n-1)/2n(1)]]=0. It implies that the areaG̃m(n-1)/2nreveals no secret information.To sum up, Gm, includingGm(n+1)/2nandG̃m(n-1)/2n, does not reveal any secret information. ■The contrast is defined to measure whether two areas (secret information and background) in the image is distinguishable by human eyes with different light transmission.Proposition 2. (Visual quality of reconstructed secret)The secret information Sm(resp. Sm−1) can be disclosed by stacking Gmwith Gm+1 (resp. Gm−1) to reconstruct RSmwhich is visually recognizable. When the number of secret images n is even, the contrast of reconstructed secret information is29. When n is odd, the contrast is2n-29n+1.Proof.Without loss of generality, the process of reconstructing Smis illustrated.Case 1: nis even,n⩾4Considering the reconstructed secret image RSmby stacking Gmand Gm+1, we firstly calculate T[RSm(0)] and T[RSm(1)].(1) In the areas Gm(0) and Gm+1(0) corresponding to the white pixel area Sm(0), there are half pixels in Gm(0) (resp. Gm+1(0)) related with Sm(0) by Step 1.2, denoted asG¯m1/2(0)(resp.G¯m+11/2(0)).G¯m1/2(0)is chosen randomly with probability of12for white andG¯m+11/2(0)is the same asG¯m1/2(0)by Step 1.2. Hence, the probability of white pixels inRS¯m1/2(0)=G¯m1/2(0)⊕G¯m+11/2(0)is kept12.The other half pixels in Gm(0) (resp. Gm+1(0)) are denoted asGm1/2(0)(resp.Gm+11/2(0)).Gm1/2(0)andGm+11/2(0)are independent by Step 1.2 such that the probability of white pixel inRSm1/2(0)=Gm1/2(0)⊕Gm+11/2(0)is12×12=14.Then the average light transmission of RSm(0) isT[RSm(0)]=1|RSm(0)|∑i=1|RS¯m1/2(0)|12+∑i=1|RSm1/2(0)|14=|RS¯m1/2(0)||RSm(0)|×12+|RSm1/2(0)||RSm(0)|×14=12×12+12×14=38, where |⋅| is the number of grid-pixels.(2) In the areas Gm(1) and Gm+1(1) corresponding to the black area Sm(1), half pixels in Gm(1) (resp. Gm+1(1)) related with Sm(1) by Step 1.2, denoted asG¯m1/2(1)(resp.G¯m+11/2(1)).G¯m1/2(1)are chosen randomly with probability of12for white andG¯m+11/2(1)is the complement ofG¯m1/2(1)by Step 1.2. Hence, the probability of white pixels inRS¯m1/2(1)=G¯m1/2(1)⊕G¯m+11/2(1)is 0, i.e.RS¯m1/2(1)are all black.The other half pixels in Gm(1) (resp. Gm+1(1)) are denoted asGm1/2(1)(resp.Gm+11/2(1)).Gm1/2(1)andGm+11/2(1)are generated randomly by Step1.2 such that the probability of white pixels inRSm1/2(1)=Gm1/2(1)⊕Gm+11/2(1)is12×12=14.Then the average light transmission of RSm(1) isT[RSm(1)]=1|RSm(1)|∑i=1|RS¯m1/2(1)|0+∑i=1|RSm1/2(1)|14=|RSm1/2(1)||RSm(1)|×14=12×14=18.The contrast of RSmisσ=T[RSm(0)]-T[RSm(1)]1+T[RSm(1)]=3/8-1/81+1/8=29∈(0,1]if n is even.Case 2: nis odd,n⩾3(1) In the areas Gm(0) and Gm+1(0) corresponding to the white area Sm(0), there aren-12n×|Sm(0)|pixels in Gm(0) (resp. Gm+1(0)) related with Sm(0) by Step 2.2, denotedasG¯m(n-1)/2n(0)(resp.G¯m+1(n-1)/2n(0)).G¯m(n-1)/2n(0)is chosen randomly with probability of12for white andG¯m+1(n-1)/2n(0)is the same asG¯m(n-1)/2n(0)by Step 2.2. Hence, the probability of white pixel inRS¯m(n-1)/2n(0)=G¯m(n-1)/2n(0)⊕G¯m+1(n-1)/2n(0)is kept12.The othern+12n×|Sm(0)|pixels in Gm(0) (resp. Gm+1(0)) are denoted asGm(n+1)/2n(0)(resp.Gm+1(n+1)/2n(0)).Gm(n+1)/2n(0)andGm+1(n+1)/2n(0)are independent by Step 2.2 such that the probability of white pixels inRSm(n+1)/2n(0)=Gm(n+1)/2n(0)⊕Gm+1(n+1)/2n(0)is12×12=14.Then the average light transmission of RSm(0) isT[RSm(0)]=1|RSm(0)|∑i=1|RS¯m(n-1)/2n(0)|12+∑i=1|RSm(n+1)/2n(0)|14=|RS¯m(n-1)/2n(0)||RSm(0)|×12+|RSm(n+1)/2n(0)||RSm(0)|×14=n-12n×12+n+12n×14=3n-18n..(1) In the areas Gm(1) and Gm+1(1) corresponding to the black pixel area Sm(1), there aren-12n×|Sm(1)|pixels of Gm(1) (resp. Gm+1(1)) related with Sm(1) by Step 2.2, denotedasG¯mn-1/2n(1)(resp.G¯m+1n-1/2n(1)).G¯mn-1/2n(1)is chosen randomly with probability of12for white andG¯m+1n-1/2n(1)is the complement ofG¯mn-1/2n(1)by Step 2.2. Hence, the probability of white pixel inRS¯m(n-1)/2n(1)=G¯mn-1/2n(1)⊕G¯m+1n-1/2n(1)is 0; i.e.RS¯m(n-1)/2n(1)are black.The othern+12n×|Sm(1)|pixels in Gm(1) and Gm+1(1) are denoted asGmn+1/2n(1)andGm+1n+1/2n(1).Gmn+1/2n(1)andGm+1n+1/2n(1)are generated independently by Step 2.2 such that the probability of white pixels inRSm(n+1)/2n(1)=Gmn+1/2n(1)⊕Gm+1n+1/2n(1)is12×12=14.Then the average light transmission of RSm(1) isT[RSm(1)]=1|RSm(1)|∑i=1|RS¯m(n-1)/2n(1)|0+∑i=1|RSm(n+1)/2n(1)|14=|RSm(n+1)/2n(1)||RSm(1)|×14=n+12n×14=n+18n.The contrast of RSmisσ=T[RSm(0)]-T[RSm(1)]1+T[RSm(1)]=(3n-1)/8n-(n+1)/8n1+(n+1)/8n=2n-29n+1∈(0,1]if n is odd.Thus, the reconstructed secret information is visually recognizable by Definition 2.■In sum, we have shown that the proposed scheme provides security and visual quality whenever n is even or odd.The cyclic property of the proposed scheme is achieved and illustrated as follows.Proposition 3. (Cyclic property)By stacking two adjacent random-grids, the study reveals the corresponding secret. Otherwise, stacking two nonadjacent ones does not reveal any secret about secrets.Proof.Stacking two adjacent random-grids demonstrates the visual quality by Proposition 2. Here, we demonstrate that stacking two nonadjacent random-grids cannot reveal any secret information. Suppose there are two nonadjacent random-grids Gaand Gbwhere b≠a−1 and b≠a+1.Case 1: nis even,n⩾4There are one half grid-pixels in Gaand Gb, denoted asGa1/2andGb1/2, which are randomly generated while the other grid-pixels, denoted asG̃a1/2andG̃b1/2, are generated associated with the former random-grid and the secret image. According to the design in Step 1.2, two cases are discussed.(1)Ga1/2toGb1/2andG̃a1/2toG̃b1/2: BecauseGa1/2andGb1/2are generated randomly, the stacked result cannot reveal any secret information.G̃a1/2(resp.G̃b1/2) is generated by the former random-gridGa-11/2(resp.Gb-11/2) and the secret imageSa-11/2(resp.Sb-11/2). Surely,Ga-11/2≠G̃b1/2andGb-11/2≠G̃a1/2because b≠a-1 and b≠a+1. It implies thatGa-11/2andGb-11/2are generated randomly, not relating with each other.SinceG̃a1/2andG̃b1/2are generated independently, stacking them does not reveal the secret information ofSa-11/2andSb-11/2.Thus, stacking Gaand Gbdoes not reveal any secret information.(2)Ga1/2toG̃b1/2andG̃a1/2toGb1/2:Ga1/2is generated randomly andG̃b1/2is generated by referring to the former random-gridGb-11/2and the secret imageSb-11/2. However, sinceb≠a+1,Gb-11/2≠Ga1/2. That implies that stackingGa1/2andG̃b1/2cannot reveal the secret information ofSb-11/2.On the other hand,Gb1/2is generated randomly andG̃a1/2is generated by referring to the former and the secret. Likewise, stackingG̃a1/2andGb1/2cannot reveal the secret. Hence, stacking two nonadjacent Gaand Gbdoes not reveal any secret information.Case 2: nis odd,n⩾3In Gaand Gb, there aren-12nh×wgrid-pixels, denoted asGan-1/2nandGbn-1/2n, randomly generated; anothern-12nh×wgrid-pixels, denoted asG̃an-1/2nandG̃bn-1/2n, generated referring to the former random-grid and the secret image. Note that there exist1nh×wgrid-pixels in Gaand Gb, denoted asGa1/nandGb1/n, generated randomly by Step 2.2, and the positions ofGa1/nin Gaare independent of those inGb1/nin Gb.Ga1/n(resp.Gb1/n) is stacked with some part inGbn-1/2norG̃bn-1/2n(resp.Gan-1/2norG̃an-1/2n). Hence, only two cases need be discussed.(1)Gan-1/2ntoGbn-1/2nandG̃an-1/2ntoG̃bn-1/2n: By the same proof procedure like Case 1 afore-mentioned, we have the result that stacking Gaand Gbdoes not reveal any secret information.(2)Gan-1/2ntoG̃bn-1/2nandG̃an-1/2ntoGbn-1/2n: By the same proof procedure like Case 1 mentioned above, we have the result that stackingGaandGbdoes not reveal any secret information.■

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
With cyclic access structure, the proposed RG-based VSS scheme provides a simple and efficient way to generate the shares for multiple secret images. The main advantages include (1) loosening limitation of secret number and (2) removing pixel expansion problem while security and visual quality are guaranteed.
