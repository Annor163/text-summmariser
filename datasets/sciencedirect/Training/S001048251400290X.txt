Neural network study for standardizing pulse-taking depth by the width of artery

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Pulse-taking depths could be expressed based on the width of the artery (WA).Two models for estimating WA were compared; the ANN model was better performance.The ANN model had two inputs (SD and CP) and one output, α. (i.e., estimated WA).Pulse signals at different depths could be acquired by α value for PDI application.The method made the description of pulse-taking depth modernized and scientized.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To carry out a pulse diagnosis, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physician presses the patient’s wrist artery at three incremental depths, namely Fu (superficial), Zhong (medium), and Chen (deep). However, the definitions of the three depths are insufficiently clear for use with modern pulse diagnosis instruments (PDIs). In this paper, a quantitative method is proposed to express the pulse-taking depths based on the width of the artery (WA). Furthermore, an index, α, is developed for estimating WA for PDI application. The α value is obtained using an artificial neural network (ANN) model with contact pressure (CP) and sensor displacement (SD) as the inputs. The WA and SD data from an ultrasound instrument and CP and SD data from a PDI were analyzed. The results show that the mean prediction error and the standard deviation (STD) of the ANN model was 1.19% and 0.0467, respectively. Comparing the ANN model with the SD model by statistical method, it showed significant difference and the improvement in the mean prediction error and the STD was 71.62% and 29.78%, respectively. The α value can thus map WA with less individual variation than that of the values estimated directly using the SD model. Pulse signals at different depths thus can be acquired according to α value while using a PDI, providing TCM physicians with more reliable pulse information.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed for thousands of years. Inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry, and palpation were the four distinctive diagnostic methods in TCM. Pulse diagnosis (PD) was studied in China about two and a half thousand years ago [1]. The skill of PD was mentioned in the “Internal Medicine Classics, Neijing” [2,3]. A TCM physician examined a patient by sensing the pulses on the radial artery [4–6]. The system of pulse examination is called the three positions and nine indicators (TPNI) [7]. As shown inFig. 1, three adjacent positions on the wrist, namely Cun (distal), Guan (middle), and Chi (proximal) are examined. For the nine indicators, the doctor feels the superficial (Fu), medium (Zhong), and deep (Chen) pulses with his three fingers (index, middle, and ring finger), corresponding to the three positions, applying light, moderate, and heavy force on the wrist artery. Then, the vertical and horizontal information of the pulse signal can be obtained.Some studies have attempted to standardize pulse-taking methods by defining palpation positions, Cun, Guan, and Chi [8], or exploring the differences in pulse signals obtained by simultaneous palpation and pressing with one finger [9]. However, few studies have discussed the pulse-taking depth, which plays an important role in PD. Pulse taking at different depths reveals different pathological features [10]. In other words, identical pulses obtained at different depths have completely different meanings [6,11]. Therefore, the pulse-taking depth should be investigated.This topic was described in the “Nanjing”, which is an ancient TCM text [2,10,12]. The pressing force was divided into five levels, each of which was quantified using increments of beans. However, this method is insufficiently accurate for pulse taking with modern instruments. It is thus desirable to standardize the pulse-taking procedure for pulse diagnosis instruments (PDIs). The depth or pressing force required for Fu, Zhong, and Chen must be precisely defined to allow the modernization of PD.Some researchers have attempted to quantize pulse depth. Tai et al. [13] proposed the decision of the level of Chen by using the lab-made wrist blood pressure instrument. The level of Chen was defined as the depth that the radial artery was obstructed. However, this method is difficult to simultaneously utilize with a PDI due to mechanical interference and it does not point out the other two depths (i.e., Fu and Zhong). Using pressure sensors, Yoon et al. [10,14] and Thakker et al. [15] classified and analyzed pulse signals acquired with light to heavy contact pressure (CP). Bae et al. [16] proposed a model for assessing the pulse depth based on sensor displacement (SD) normal to the skin surface. They considered that temperature would affect the accuracy of tactile sensor and inhomogeneous elasticity at the palpation positions would influence the measured signals in the CP model. Yoo et al. [17] proposed a method for pulse wave extraction that incorporates the personal characteristics of the patients. Pulse waves are continuously measured as moving the sensor to press the artery with fixed speed. From the measured pulse wave, they found the local maximum values of the first and last sensed pulses. Then, the values of the slightest and heaviest hold-down pressures were determined and divided into five steps. The method works well for healthy people, but according to TCM theory, certain diseases can cause the pulse floating up or sinking down (for instance, fever would cause the pulse floating up and weak person had the pulse sinking down).As mentioned, there is no comprehensive method for determining pulse-taking depth for PDI application, making it difficult for modern TCM studies to reach a consensus. The present study thus proposes a method that defines the pulse-taking depth based on a reliable physiological characteristic, the width of the artery (WA). This proposed method defines the initial touching position (WA=0) as the starting point and the artery obstructed position (WA=1) as the ending point. Then, the Fu, Zhong, Chen are defined by the different percentages of WA. That made the pulse-taking depth more universal for the subject whether he or she was sick or not. This is accomplished by merging the advantages of SD and CP using an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed method is objective and reliable for obtaining pulse data from a PDI.
