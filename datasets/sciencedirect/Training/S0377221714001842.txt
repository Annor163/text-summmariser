@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Although splitting shipments across multiple delivery modes typically increases total shipping costs as a result of diseconomies of scale, it may offer certain benefits that can more than offset these costs. These benefits include a reduction in the probability of stockout and in the average inventory costs. We consider a single-stage inventory replenishment model that includes two delivery modes: a cheaper, less reliable mode, and another, more expensive but perfectly reliable mode. The high-reliability mode is only utilized in replenishment intervals in which the lead time of the less-reliable mode exceeds a certain value. This permits substituting the high-reliability mode for safety stock, to some degree. We characterize optimal replenishment decisions with these two modes, as well as the potential benefits of simultaneously using two delivery modes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In inventory replenishment, the three main criteria of cost, quality, and delivery reliability are of paramount importance in evaluating supplier performance, where delivery reliability is typically a function of the supplier’s lead-time performance, as noted by Minner (2003). All else being equal, lower cost shipping modes imply both longer and less reliable delivery lead-time performance. Using such suppliers therefore tends to necessitate at least an occasional use of quick-response suppliers who can fill the gaps when the low-cost supplier’s lead time is too long. Even if a single supplier is preferred for sourcing, a variety of different delivery modes are typically available to shippers, depending on the product type. That is, a wide range of package carriers and third-party logistics providers may be used to fulfill orders. Because of the uncertainty in delivery performance of different modes, it is not immediately clear which mode, or what mix of different modes, should be used when ordering from a supplier or from multiple suppliers.This research focuses on the benefits of delivery mode diversification as a strategy to reduce inventory-related costs. We consider a system in which a “buyer” uses two different delivery modes for inventory replenishment. These modes may correspond to entirely different suppliers, or they may imply different delivery modes employed by a single supplier. In particular, we consider an inventory replenishment model where the buyer uses a continuous review(Q,r)replenishment policy and has a constant, deterministic demand rate ofλunits per unit time. Our model assumes that the buyer does not permit shortages, and may use two different shipping modes within each inventory replenishment cycle. One of these modes comes at a low cost, but is less reliable, reflected by a stochastic delivery lead time (with a finite upper bound). In addition, a higher cost, perfectly reliable shipping mode is available if needed.We assume that the uncertainty in the delivery time of the less reliable supply mode results to a large extent from a high utilization of this mode. Our model considers the effect that an increase in the utilization of a stressed shipping mode has on delivery performance. This is done by expressing the maximum value of the less reliable mode’s lead time as a stepwise, nondecreasing function of the order size. We can think of the less reliable supply mode as traversing an already congested route, where sending a larger quantity via this mode might require increasing the number of trucks using the route (or the frequency at which trucks utilize the route). As a result, more capacity is consumed and the expected value and variability of the travel time for the entire order quantity along the route increase. Alternatively, an increase in order quantity would also likely increase the required production time, which leads to an increase the delivery lead time for the order. For the perfectly reliable mode, we assume that it has a sufficient degree of excess capacity, and therefore, it will not be affected by the quantity ordered.Using multiple transportation modes and making dynamic decisions for deliveries within a supply chain has become more prevalent in recent years with the ability to use information technology to obtain near real-time information on the status of orders placed with suppliers. For example, Liz Claiborne uses a product from TradeBeam that enables monitoring the status of orders placed with suppliers and expediting these orders when needed using an online tool (see Jain, Groenevelt, & Rudi (2010)). The use of multiple sourcing of supply has also been studied in the context of managing supply chain disruptions. Yu, Zeng, and Zhao (2009) discuss several practical situations in which firms have been able to mitigate the impacts of supply disruptions through the use of multiple sourcing strategies. They evaluate the impact of using single or dual sourcing strategies to manage the impacts of supply chain disruptions. Their model also assumes the presence of a less reliable and cheaper supplier (identified as a foreign supplier) and a more reliable but more expensive supplier (characterized as a local supplier). Babich, Aydin, Brunet, Keppo, and Saigal (2012) state that one of the main reasons for firms to diversify their supply base is to manage supply risk. Their work reviews the relationship among financing constraints, trade-credit loans and the number of suppliers. Dong and Tomlin (2012) mention the use of inventory, emergency sourcing, dual sourcing, demand management and process improvement as operational measures to manage disruption risk, and they study the interaction between business interruption insurance and operational measures to manage risk (specifically the use of inventory and emergency sourcing).Our work falls within a stream of literature on multiple sourcing inventory models. Following the characterization that Minner (2003) presented in his review of multiple-supplier inventory models, we identify two main lines of research based on the assumptions regarding supplier lead times. First, we will review inventory models with n supply modes with deterministic lead times, where the general assumption is thatL1<L2…<Lnandc1>c2…>cn, whereLiandciare the lead time and unit purchasing cost for supply mode i, fori=1,…,n. The main focus of most of the works that employ this assumption is to define optimal replenishment policies or to define policy parameters for a specific replenishment policy. After discussing these works, we will review models that assume multiple delivery options with stochastic lead times. These models are primarily concerned with order splitting, where an order is placed at the beginning of a replenishment cycle and is split among different suppliers.Among the studies that assume the use of supply modes with deterministic lead times, Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988) consider a model with a continuous review policy, two supply modes and random demand; their goal is to find the order quantities and reorder points for each supply mode in order to minimize total inventory costs. Later, Moinzadeh and Schmidt (1991) presented a model based on a one-for-one(S-1,S)inventory policy with two supply options, where the decision on whether to place an order with the regular or emergency supplier depends on the age of the outstanding order. Jain et al. (2010) consider a(Q,r)policy in which two transportation modes exist, each with a deterministic lead time and fixed plus variable shipping cost structure. After the manufacturing lead time, the buyer must decide on how much of the order to ship via each transportation mode under stochastic demand. In contrast with our model, these works assume deterministic lead times for both supply modes and allow inventory shortages.Several past works on multiple sourcing consider a fast emergency supplier, which can be used to avoid shortages by placing an emergency order (based on some triggering condition). For example, Tagaras and Vlachos (2001) assume an emergency order is placed when the probability of stockout is high; Chiang and Gutierrez (1996) propose an ‘indifference level’ for inventory that triggers a second order; in Johansen and Thorstenson (1998), the reorder point for the emergency supplier is a function of the time until the regular order arrives. Our model is similar in spirit to these works, except that an order is placed with the ‘emergency supplier’ only when reaching a given time point in the replenishment cycle, and only if the order from the primary (cheaper) supply mode has not arrived by this time point.Instead of using multiple supply modes, Chiang and Chiang (1996) propose an inventory model with one supplier and multiple deliveries. They assume the use of a continuous review policy with Normally distributed demand, constant lead time and a predetermined service level. In their model an order of size Q is placed at the beginning of the replenishment cycle, which is split between n deliveries with interarrival timesLifori=1,2,…,n. We find a similar approach in Chiang (2001), who proposes the use of one supply mode and multiple deliveries for periodic review(R,S)inventory systems. In both of these papers, the cost reduction, when compared with a single delivery mode, results from a reduction in cycle stock. Unlike the previous works in the literature, we propose the use of multiple supply modes with different ordering and purchasing costs and different levels of delivery reliability. Our model does not place orders with the two supply modes at the beginning of the replenishment cycle; on the contrary, we decide whether to place a second order with the more reliable and expensive supply mode at a specific time during the replenishment cycle, only if the first order has not arrived by that time.Past works on models that assume stochastic lead times and multiple delivery options are primarily concerned with order splitting. In order splitting, an order is placed at the beginning of the replenishment cycle, and is split among different suppliers. The main benefit of using order splitting is the reduction in the effective lead time (the time until the first order arrives), which leads to a reduction in the safety stock level required to meet a given service level. This effect was demonstrated by Sculli and Wu (1981) and Kelle and Silver (1990), when each order is split between two suppliers. Later, Pan, Ramasesh, Hayya, and Keith Ord (1991), based on order statistics, presented expressions to estimate the parameters for the distributions of the effective lead time and time between arrivals when two supply modes with identical lead-time distributions are used. As an example, they considered three lead-time distributions: Normal, Uniform, and Exponential, and observed a reduction in the mean and variance of the effective lead time, compared with the use of a single supply mode.Most of the relevant models that assume stochastic lead times also assume(Q,r)inventory policies, and seek the optimal order quantity, reorder point and the proportion of order splitting, as in Lau and Lau (1994) and Lau and Zhao (1993), the latter accounting for stochastic demand. These works showed that most of the savings from order splitting result from a reduction in cycle stock, which often exceeds the cost savings due to associated safety stock reduction. Ramasesh, Ord, Hayya, and Pan (1991) showed that, under the assumption of identical lead-time distributions for the different supply modes, an optimal solution is found when the order is split equally, and that the savings come from reduced holding and backordering costs. A different approach was presented by Ganeshan, Tyworth, and Guo (1999), who proposed a discounting option for the less reliable supplier, and presented exchange curves to define when it is beneficial to split the order, as well as the percentage discount necessary to make the model attractive.Our model differs from previous literature as it considers one (cheaper, less reliable) supply mode with a stochastic lead time and another with a perfectly reliable (deterministic) lead time. This more closely reflects typical cases in which a buyer uses a primary delivery mode that is not perfectly reliable, but may place expedited orders (via, e.g., overnight shipping) when stockouts become imminent. In contrast with order splitting models, our work does not place an order with two shipping modes at the beginning of every replenishment cycle. Instead, we seek the optimal reorder point and order quantity such that the long-run expected inventory ordering, holding and purchasing costs are minimized without any shortages (i.e., with a 100% service level). Our assumption of a 100% service level is intended to approximate systems with extremely high stockout costs, and we recognize that many practical systems operate at near 100%, although they are not perfectly reliable (see Graves & Willems (2000) for a similar application of a 100% service level as an approximation to ensure model tractability). Note that a distinguishing feature of our model is reflected in the fact that we need not always place an order with the reliable delivery mode. That is, if the order from the unreliable supplier arrives sufficiently early in the cycle, we need not place an order with the reliable supply mode. In other words, we can ‘wait-and-see’ whether a second order is needed in each cycle, allowing us to incorporate specific information about the unreliable supplier’s performance in each cycle before determining whether a second order is needed.This feature resembles the use of expediting policies, as in the work presented by Chiang (2010), who considers a single-item continuous review expedited ordering policy with stochastic demand, order quantity Q and reorder point s. In his model, if at the end of the supplier’s manufacturing time, the inventory level falls below the expedite-up-to-level R (R<s), the firm requests that part of its order is expedited (via a fast transportation mode) to bring its inventory level up to R; the remainder of the order is delivered through the regular supply mode. In contrast to our model, where the decision time on whether to use the second supply mode may occur at any time during the replenishment cycle, Chiang’s model assumes that this expediting decision must be made after the order has been manufactured but before it has been shipped. In addition, the expedited order serves as a fraction of the original order, where we permit an additional order quantity above the amount that was ordered via the regular supply mode. In particular, our model sets a reorder pointr=λτ¯, whereτ¯corresponds to an amount of time that may be less than an upper limit on the lead time of the lower cost shipping mode (assuming this lead-time distribution is bounded from above). If an order is placed at time zero, thenτ¯is the time at which the current on-hand inventory will reach zero, i.e., the inventory ‘run-out’ time. Suppose that at the beginning of each replenishment cycle the buyer places an order using the less reliable shipping mode. If the order has not been received by timeτ¯-L2, whereL2is the lead time of the perfectly reliable shipping mode, the buyer will need to place a second order with the faster, reliable shipping mode, which will be received at timeτ¯, thereby avoiding any shortages.Another important attribute that differentiates our model from previous works is that we account for the impact that a variation in the utilization level of a congested supply mode has on delivery performance. We assume that the lead time of the less reliable supply mode follows a continuous distribution that is supported on a bounded interval, and that as we increase the size of the order placed with this supplier, the upper bound on its delivery time may also increase; therefore, there is a corresponding increase in the variance of the delivery time.We are interested in the degree to which using the reliable, quick-response supply mode can reduce inventory-related costs when compared with the use of a single shipping mode. We are also interested in characterizing the circumstances and system parameter values under which the use of both supply modes is beneficial. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model description, where expressions for the cost functions are derived. Section 3 presents a numerical analysis and shows the circumstances under which our proposed model is preferable to using only a single shipping mode, and Section 4 summarizes our work and discusses future research directions.This section first describes the costs associated with the use of a single shipping mode and then with the use of two shipping modes for inventory replenishment.We first consider the cost of using each shipping mode independently, which will permit benchmarking the performance of the model with two delivery modes.We consider an inventory replenishment model where a buyer uses a continuous review(Q,r)policy, with constant demand rateλ, where no order crossing is permitted. The buyer orders from a supplier with unlimited capacity who ships via a mode with a stochastic lead time, called shipping mode 1. Given that we treat time as continuous, we initially assume that this delivery lead time follows a Uniform distribution, whereL1is the random variable for mode 1 lead time, andτlandτudenote the lower and upper limits forL1(note that our later numerical tests will consider a more general lead-time distribution, namely a Beta distribution).We assume that the buyer desires a zero probability of stockout; therefore,Q⩾rand the reorder point, r, must equalλτu, when the supplier uses mode 1 exclusively. Fig. 1shows a realization of the model, assuming without loss of generality that an order is placed at time zero.Since the lead time is Uniformly distributed, the probability of an order arrival before or at time t isP{L1⩽t}=t-τlτu-τlwheret∈[τl,τu]. Based on this probability we can compute the expected inventory level at any timet∈[0,T], wheret=0is the time when an order is placed, i.e., when the inventory level is equal to r, andT=Qλis the length of the replenishment cycle.To find the expected inventory level at any timet∈[0,T], we divide the cycle into three different intervals:[0,τl),[τl,τu),[τu,T]. The first interval starts at time zero, when the inventory level is equal to r and an order of size Q is placed. From this time until the end of the cycle, the inventory level will be depleted at a constant rate ofλunits per unit of time due to demand. Since the order will arrive at or after timeτl, we have thatP{L1<τl}=0, and the expected inventory level during the interval[0,τl)isλτu-λt.Given that the arrival time is Uniformly distributed betweenτlandτu, at any timet∈[τl,τu]the expected inventory level increases (with respect to the level during the interval[0,τl)) byQP{L1⩽t}; therefore, during the interval[τl,τu)the expected inventory level isλτu+Qt-τlτu-τl-λt. For the remaining interval, the order of size Q has been received with probability one, and therefore, the expected inventory level isλτu+Q-λt.As a result, the expected inventory level is:E[I(t)]=λτu-λt,0⩽t<τl,tQτu-τl-λ+λτu-Qτlτu-τl,τl⩽t⩽τu,(Q+λτu)-λt,τu<t⩽T.As shown in Appendix A, we needQ⩾λ(τu-τl)to prevent order crossing. Also, in order to prevent shortages, the size of the order has to be at least the size of the reorder point, i.e.,Q⩾λτu. Based on the previous conditions for the size of Q, we can see that the expected inventory duringt∈[τl,τu]will have a positive slope. Fig. 2shows the expected inventory level as a function of time.We next determine the average inventory level in a replenishment cycle. In order to find the average total inventory per cycle, denoted byIT, we integrate the expected inventory level over the cycle, which is equal to:IT=Q22λ+Q(τu-τl)2.To obtain the average inventory level per unit time, denoted byI^, we divide the average total inventory by T, which givesI^=Q2+12λ(τu-τl).This model has a safety stock of12λτu-τlsince, on average, orders will be received at time12(τu+τl)and the inventory position at that time isIt=τu-τl2=r-12λ(τu+τl), which is equal to12λ(τu-τl).To compute the total relevant cost per cycle we consider a fixed order cost, inventory holding cost, and variable purchasing cost. We defineA1as the cost of placing an order using shipping mode 1, h as the inventory holding cost per unit per unit time, andc1as the unit purchasing cost when using mode 1. For this model, the average total cost per replenishment cycle isTC1(Q)=A1+hQ22λ+Q(τu-τl)2+c1Q.The expected cost per cycle is equal to the average total cost divided by the length of the cycle, which equals(2.1)G1(Q)=A1λQ+hQ2+12λ(τu-τl)+c1λ.Since the second derivative of the average cost function,∂2G1∂Q2=2A1λQ3, is non-negative∀Q>0, the function is convex forQ>0and will reach its minimum at Q such that∂f∂Q=0, which implies(2.2)Q1∗=2λA1h.The above equation implies that the order quantity corresponds to the economic order quantity (EOQ). UsingQ1∗inG1(Q)we have a minimum average cost per cycle of(2.3)G1=2λA1h+λhΔτ2+λc1,whereΔτ=τu-τl. We may view the second term above,λhΔτ2, as the incremental cost over that of the standard EOQ Model, due to the uncertainty in the delivery mode 1 lead time.We next consider the possibility that the degree of uncertainty in the delivery time of shipping mode 1 may be affected by the level of utilization of this mode. Therefore, we would like to account for the potential effect that a change in the utilization of mode 1 has on delivery performance. To approximate this effect, we define the upper limit on mode 1 lead time,τu, as a step function of the order size Q, such that,τu=τuiifqi⩽Q<qi+1fori=1,2,…,n, whereqi<qi+1,τui<τui+1and n is the number of intervals for Q. Fig. 3shows a graph ofτuas a function of Q.The procedure to find the optimal order size Q under the assumption thatτuis a stepwise function of the order size is similar to the one used by Chopra and Meindl (2007) to find the optimal order quantity under an all units quantity discount scheme.Observe from Eq. (2.2) that the optimal order size under supply mode 1 is independent ofτu. Consequently, as we increase the value ofτu, all else being equal, the value of Q that minimizes the average inventory cost will not change, but the average inventory cost will increase by12λhτui+1-τuifori=1,…,n-1, where n is the number of intervals forτu. Fig. 4shows the average inventory cost function whenτufollows a step function of Q.Based on the previous observation, the optimal value of Q whenτuis a step function of the order size is either on the (unique) interval whereQ1, obtained from (2.2), is feasible, or at one of the break points to the left ofQ1. Appendix B presents a detailed description of the solution procedure to findQ1∗when shipping mode 1 is used exclusively.An alternative approach to account for the impact that utilization has on the delivery performance of mode 1 would be to define the lead-time upper bound of mode 1 as a linear function of Q, such thatτu=τˆu+γQ, whereτˆuis the base level for the lead-time upper bound of mode 1, andγis the factor by which the lead time increases per unit ordered. The procedure to find the average inventory cost per unit time whenτuis a linear function of Q, represented byG1γ, is similar to the one used whenτuis fixed. As result we obtain:G1γ(Q)=A1λQ+hQ2+12λ(τˆu+γQ-τl)+c1λ.Observe that when the lead-time upper bound is a linear function of the order size Q, then as we increase the quantity ordered we will have an increase in the average inventory holding cost equal to12hλγQ, due to the increase in safety stock.The average inventory cost per unit time is a convex function of Q, since∂2G1γ∂Q2=2A1λQ3>0∀Q>0, the order size that minimizes the average inventory cost per unit time isQγ∗=2λA1h(1+λγ),and the minimum average inventory cost is given byG1=2λA1h(1+λγ)+hλΔτ2+λc1.For the remainder, we will assume that the lead-time upper bound for delivery mode 1,τu, is a step function of Q, since we believe this provides a better approximation of the effect that the order quantity has on the delivery time of a stressed supply mode. That is, a step function allows for changes at discrete quantities, as may be the case when an additional truck is required for a highly congested route or an additional production batch is required on a capacitated production line.We next consider the cost of using a shipping mode, called mode 2, that has a deterministic lead timeL2. In this case we can use the EOQ model whereQ2∗is equal toQ2∗=2λA2h,A2is the fixed cost of placing an order when using mode 2, h is the inventory holding cost per unit per unit time, andλis the constant demand rate. We recognize that a more general model would permit holding costs that depend on the variable purchase cost. However, this difference in holding cost is typically very small in practice, and the resulting model in which holding costs do not depend on purchase cost permits obtaining much more in the way of analytical results (our computational tests presented later consider the impact of holding costs that depend on variable costs, and show that this impact is quite small).Lettingc2denote the unit purchasing cost for mode 2 andΔc=c2-c1, the average cost per replenishment cycle is equal to:(2.4)G2=2λA2h+λ(c1+Δc).In order to compare the average cost of exclusively using shipping mode 1 versus mode 2, we subtract (2.4) from (2.3). Assuming thatA1⩽A2andΔc⩾0we obtain:(2.5)G1-G2⩽λhΔτ2-λΔc=ω,whereω=λhΔτ2-λΔc. Note that whenω⩽0mode 1 should be chosen as the preferred single mode. Later we will use this expression during the computation of the average inventory cost per replenishment cycle for the dual-mode model.We next present a model where the buyer may use two different shipping modes, implying a positive (expected) order quantity for both modes. We will then compare our proposed dual-mode model with the single-mode model and choose the one with the minimum expected cost per unit time.Our proposed model assumes that in addition to mode 1, the buyer may place a second order that will use an expedited shipping mode, called mode 2, with deterministic lead time,L2. In this case, in order to reduce the required safety stock, the buyer may define a different reorder pointr=λτ¯, whereτ¯∈[L2,τu), and whereQ⩾rin order to avoid shortages. Note that for the dual-mode model,τ¯is strictly less thanτu(in other words, the expected order quantity via mode 2 is strictly positive; the case in which the expected order quantity is zero corresponds to the single-mode case with mode 1 only). Usingτ¯to define the reorder point increases the probability of stockout toP{L1⩾τ¯}=τu-max{τl,τ¯}τu-τl, which is strictly greater than zero, sinceτ¯<τu.Given that the buyer desires a zero probability of stockout, this may require using mode 2, which will be used as a backup in cases whereL1>τ¯-L2. Note thatτ¯-L2is the time at which the buyer must place a second order using mode 2 if the mode 1 order has not arrived. If this is the case, then the buyer must place an order forλ(τu-τ¯)units that will be sent via mode 2. This second order will arrive at timeτ¯, which is the inventory run-out time, and must contribute enough inventory to avoid stocking out in the case thatL1=τu, which is the worst-case delivery time for mode 1.Note that we assume thatτuis a step function of Q, as shown in Fig. 3. This means that the lead-time upper bound for mode 1 will increase for increasing values of the quantity ordered. In the following section we first develop the expressions for the average inventory cost for the dual-mode model, and after that we will present a procedure to find an optimal solution for our proposed model whenτuis a step function of Q.Observe that ifτ¯-L2<τl, then the buyer must decide on whether to place an order via mode 2 before any information regarding the value ofL1can be obtained (i.e., before timeτl). In this case, the supplier must place an order with mode 2 (otherwise, the probability of a stockout is positive, violating the 100% service level). On the other hand, ifτ¯-L2⩾τl, then there is a positive probability that no order will be placed via mode 2 in a cycle. Because there are two distinct cases based on the relative values ofτ¯-L2andτl, the following subsections will consider these cases separately.At timeτ¯-L2, the buyer must determine whether the mode 1 order has arrived to evaluate whether it is necessary to place a mode 2 order. Whenτ¯∈[L2,τl+L2)we have thatτ¯-L2<τl, and, therefore, the buyer will always place a mode 2 order. Fig. 5shows an example of the model realization.Observe that the replenishment cycle starts when the inventory level reachesr=λτ¯units. During the cycle the buyer orders Q units via mode 1 andλ(τu-τ¯)units via mode 2. Therefore, the cycle will restart at timeT=Qλ+(τu-τ¯).To analyze the expected inventory level at any time t, we divide the replenishment cycle into four intervals:[0,τl),[τl,τ¯),[τ¯,τu),[τu,T]. Assume without loss of generality that the cycle starts at timet=0, when the inventory level isλτ¯and an order of size Q is placed with mode 1. This order will be received at some timet∈[τl,τu]; therefore, the probability of receiving the order during the first interval isP{L1<τl}=0.During the replenishment cycle, the inventory level will decrease at a constant rateλper unit time due to demand, and hence the expected inventory level duringt∈[0,τl)isλτ¯-λt.During the second intervalt∈[τl,τ¯), the expected inventory level is equal toλτ¯+QP{L1⩽t}-λt, whereP{L1⩽t}=t-τlτu-τl, as in the single-mode model.A shift in the expected inventory function occurs att=τ¯, when the order of sizeλ(τu-τ¯)shipped via mode 2 arrives, and hence the expected inventory level during the third interval isλτu+QP{L1⩽t}-λt.By timet=τuthe order from supplier 1 has arrived with probability one and the expected inventory level isQ+λτu-λtuntil the end of the cycle.A summary of the expected inventory level as a function of time is presented below.E[I(t)]=λτ¯-λt,0⩽t<τl,tQτu-τl-λ+[λτ¯-Qτlτu-τl],τl⩽t<τ¯,tQτu-τl-λ+λτu-Qτlτu-τl,τ¯⩽t<τu,(Q+λτu)-λt,τu⩽t⩽Qλ+τu-τ¯.Fig. 6shows the expected inventory level as a function of time.Recall that because we assumeQ⩾λ(τu-τl)(that is, we assume no order crossing; see Appendix A), the slope of the function fort∈[τl,τu]is non-negative.We can integrate the expected inventory level curve over the cycle to find the average total inventory per cycle, which givesIT=Q22λ+Q(τu-τl)2+λ2(τu-τ¯)2.The average inventory per cycle is the average total inventory divided by T, which equalsI^=Q2+Qλ(τu-τl)+λ2(τu-τ¯)22[Q+λ(τu-τ¯)].For the dual-mode model, the fixed order cost has two components:A1, which is the fixed order cost incurred by the buyer when placing the first order via mode 1; andA‾, which is the additional order cost incurred when placing an expedited order via mode 2. Note that the expedited order may be placed with the same supplier or may be planned when placing the first order; we therefore assume thatA‾⩽A2, since part of the associated fixed order cost is incurred when placing the first order in the cycle.The total cost per cycle includes the fixed order cost,A1+A‾, the inventory holding cost per unit per unit time, h, and the purchasing cost per unit shipped by modes 1 and 2, denoted byc1andc2, respectively. This implies an average total cost per cycle equal to:TCI=(A1+A‾)+hQ22λ+Q(τu-τl)2+λ2(τu-τ¯)2+(Qc1+λ(τu-τ¯)c2).The average cost per cycle is equal to the total cost per cycle divided by the cycle length T, which equalsGI(Q,τ¯)=λ(A1+A‾)+h2(Q2+Qλ(τu-τl)+λ2(τu-τ¯)2)+c1Qλ+c2λ2(τu-τ¯)Q+λ(τu-τ¯).Without loss of generality we letA=A1+A‾andβ=(τu-τ¯). Observe thatλβ=Q2, i.e., the quantity delivered via mode 2. Thus, the total order quantity in a cycle equalsQ+λβ.Noting that Q andβare decision variables, and the average cost per unit time is given by(2.6)GI(Q,β)=λA(Q+λβ)+h(Q+λβ)2+λ(Q+λβ)(c1Q1+c2λβ)+λhQ(Q+λβ)τ¯-τu+τl2.The first three terms of (2.6), are the average annual fixed order cost, holding cost and purchasing cost of the EOQ model if we were to orderQ+λβunits, and with a deterministic lead time equal toτ¯. The last term represents a correction factor for the average annual holding cost term to account for the fact that the order of size Q faces a stochastic lead time. To illustrate this, note that in our model, the order placed with supply mode 2 will always arrive at timeτ¯; however, the order placed with supply mode 1 may arrive at any time betweenτlandτu. In the case that the expected lead time for the order placed with mode 1,τu+τl2, is less thanτ¯, the second term of (2.6) underestimates the average annual holding cost, and therefore, the correction factor will be positive; on the other hand, if the expected lead time of supply mode 1 is greater thanτ¯, the correction factor will be negative, since we are overestimating the average annual holding cost.From Appendix C we have thatGI(Q,β)is convex∀Q>0andβ>0if4λAh>ω2, whereω=λhΔτ2-λΔc(Appendix C also provides an argument as to why this condition is likely to be mild and non-restrictive in practice). Therefore we find a stationary point forGI(Q,β)using the conditions∂GI∂β=0and∂GI∂Q=0.As result, we have that for a givenβ, assuming the convexity condition is met, the optimal Q and minimum average inventory cost per cycle are:(2.7)Q∗(β)=-λβ+2λ2β2-λ2βΔτ+2λ2βΔch+2λAh;(2.8)GI(β)=h2λ2β2-λ2βΔτ+2λ2βΔch+2λAh+λhΔτ2-β+λc1.Using∂GI∂β=0, we arrive at the following stationary point solution forβ:β∗=12λh4λAh-λhΔτ2-λΔc2+λhΔτ2-λΔc.Substitutingω=λhΔτ2-λΔcandα=4λAh, we have(2.9)β∗=12λhα-ω2+ω,and the optimal value for Q can then be expressed as(2.10)Q∗=12hα-ω2-ω.Assuming the stationary point solution is feasible, because the total order quantity per cycle equalsQ∗+λβ∗, Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10) indicate that the total order quantity per cycle at optimality equals(2.11)Q∗+λβ∗=α-ω2h.Based on 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11, we observe that the quantities shipped via modes 1 and 2 (and the total order quantity per cycle) are concave functions ofω. The total order quantity per cycle will attain its maximum whenω=0, which results inQ∗=λβ. This means that when the incremental holding cost due to the uncertainty in the lead time of mode 1 is equal to the additional purchasing cost per unit of mode 2, the dual-mode model will order the same quantity from both supply modes, assuming the stationary points for (2.6) are feasible, i.e.,Q>0andβ∈[τu-τl-L2,τu-L2).We also observe that whenω<0we will haveQ∗>λβ. The reason for this is that a negative value ofωindicates that the average inventory cost when using shipping mode 1 exclusively is less than the average inventory cost of using shipping mode 2, and therefore, the dual mode model will increase the use of shipping mode 1. The opposite happens whenω>0, when the incremental cost of using shipping mode 2 over the standard EOQ model is smaller than the incremental cost of using shipping mode 1, and as a resultλβ>Q∗.Using (2.9) and (2.10), the minimum average inventory cost is(2.12)GI∗=12α-ω2+ω+λc2.Note that when the stationary point solutionβ∗is feasible, i.e.,β∗∈(τu-τl-L2,τu-L2]we will use (2.10) and (2.12) forQ∗andGI∗, respectively; otherwise the optimal value ofβwill be at an end point of the interval and we will use (2.7) and (2.8) at the appropriate value ofβto determineQ∗andGI∗, respectively.Now that we have an expression for the average inventory cost for the dual-mode model whenτ¯∈[L2,L2+τl), we can derive a method for determining optimal order quantities for modes 1 and 2 whenτuis a step function of Q, such thatτu=τuiifqi⩽Q<qi+1fori=1,2,…,n, whereqi<qi+1,τui<τui+1, and n is the number of intervals for Q.Note that because an increase inτuincreases the uncertainty in the arrival time of the order placed with mode 1, we expect to observe an increase in the average inventory holding cost for increasing values ofτu. However, in some cases, when the stationary point solution forβis not feasible, and therefore, the optimalβis found at one of the end points of the interval (in particular,β=τu-L2), the average inventory cost may actually decrease asτuincreases. The reason for this is that, in this case, it is preferable to increase the size of the order placed with mode 2, (λ(τu-τ¯)); as a result, as we increase the value ofτu, an increased order quantity with supply mode 2 may actually decrease the average inventory holding cost.As in the single-mode case, our solution procedure is similar to the one used by Chopra and Meindl (2007) to find the optimal order quantity under the all units quantity discount scheme; however, becauseGImay increase or decrease for increasing values ofτu, as explained above, when we analyze an interval i, if the stationary point for Q is not feasible for that interval, we still need to evaluate the value of Q at one of the breakpoints, depending on whetherQ>qi+1orQ<qi. Algorithm 1, in Appendix D, provides a detailed description of the solution procedure to find the minimum average inventory cost for the dual-mode model whenτuis a step function of Q.In our dual-mode model, at timeτ¯-L2the buyer must determine whether or not to place a second order via mode 2 if the first order has not yet arrived. Since Case 2 considers the intervalτ¯∈[τl+L2,τu), we have thatτ¯-L2⩾τl, and the probability of placing a second order isP{L1⩾(τ¯-L2)}=τu-(τ¯-L2)τu-τl.WhenL1⩽τ¯-L2there is no need to place an expedited order using mode 2, and therefore the total amount ordered in the cycle is Q. This occurs with probabilityP{L1⩽(τ¯-L2)}=(τ¯-L2-τl)τu-τl. Fig. 7shows an example of this case.WhenL1>τ¯-L2, a second order of sizeλ(τu-τ¯)is placed at timet=τ¯-L2, which will be shipped using mode 2 and will be received at timeτ¯. This occurs with probabilityP{L1>(τ¯-L2)}=τu-(τ¯-L2)τu-τl. Fig. 8shows an example of this case.Based on the probability of each of these sub-cases, we can compute the expected inventory as a function of time. As in the previous section we will divide the replenishment cycle into four intervals:[0,τl),[τl,τ¯),[τ¯,τu),[τu,T], where T, the cycle length, is now a random variable, andE[T]is the expected cycle length, i.e.,E[T]=QλP{L1⩽τ¯-L2}+Qλ+(τu-τ¯)P{L1>τ¯-L2},where after substitutingP{L1⩽τ¯-L2}=τ¯-L2-τlτu-τl, we have(2.13)E[T]=Qλ+(τu-τ¯)τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl.The replenishment cycle starts at timet=0, when the inventory level isλτ¯and an order of size Q is placed, which will be sent via mode 1 and received at some timet∈[τl,τu]; the probability of receiving the order during the first interval isP{L1<τl}=0.During the replenishment cycle, the inventory level decreases at a constant rate ofλper unit time due to demand, and hence the expected inventory level duringt∈[0,τl)isλτ¯-λt. During the second interval,t∈[τl,τ¯), the expected inventory level is equal toλτ¯+QP{L1⩽t}-λt, whereP{L1⩽t}=t-τlτu-τl. If, at timet=τ¯-L2, the buyer does not place an expedited order using mode 2, this means that the mode 1 order has been received, and the inventory level fort∈[τ¯,τu)is equal toλτ¯+Q-λt, which occurs with probabilityP{L1⩽τ¯-L2}. With probabilityP{L1>τ¯-L2}, however, the buyer places a second order via mode 2 at timet=τ¯-L2forλ(τu-τ¯)units, which will be received at timeτ¯.For the latter case, when the second order with mode 2 was placed at timet=τ¯-L2, we can have two situations for the intervalt∈[τ¯,τu):1.L1>t, where the inventory level isλτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)-λt, fort∈[τ¯,τu);L1⩽t, where the inventory level isλτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)+Q-λt, fort∈[τ¯,τu).Therefore, fort∈[τ¯,τu), the expected inventory level is:E[I(t|τ¯⩽t<τu)]=P{L1⩽τ¯-L2}(λτ¯+Q-λt)+P{L1>t}(λτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)-λt)+P{τ¯-L2<L1⩽t}(λτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)+Q-λt),which results inE[I(t|τ¯⩽t<τu)]=tQτu-τl-λ+λτ¯-Qτlτu-τl+λ(τu-τ¯)τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl.The last interval of the cycle ist∈[τu,T]. By timet=τuthe order from supplier 1 has arrived with probability one, and we have two cases with respect to the second order:1.IfL1⩽τ¯-L2, the inventory level isQ+λτ¯-λtafter timet=τu, andT=Q/λ+τ¯;IfL1>τ¯-L2, the inventory level isQ+λτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)-λtafter timet=τu, andT=Q/λ+τu.Therefore the expected inventory fort∈[τu,T]is:E[I(t)]=Q+λτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl-λt.A summary of the expected inventory level as a function of time is presented below. Fig. 9shows the expected inventory level as a function of time.E[I(t)]=λτ¯-λt,0⩽t<τl,t[Qτu-τl-λ]+[λτ¯-Qτlτu-τl],τl⩽t<τ¯,tQτu-τl-λ+λτ¯-Qτlτu-τl+λ(τu-τ¯)τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl,τ¯⩽t<τu,Q+λτ¯+λ(τu-τ¯)τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl-λt,τu⩽t⩽T.The assumption that the model does not allow shortages or order crossing requires thatQ⩾λτ¯andQ⩾λ(τu-τl)(from Appendix A). Therefore, we can see that the slope of the expected inventory function is non-negative fort∈[τl,τu].In order to characterize the average total inventory per replenishment cycle, we integrate the expected inventory function over the four intervals, and we obtain:(2.14)E[I]=Q22λ+Q2(τu-τl)[(τu-τ¯)2+2(τu-τ¯)L2+(τ¯-τl)2]+λ[(τu-τ¯)2+(τu-τ¯)L2]22(τu-τl)2Our model can be analyzed as a renewal reward process (see Appendix F), and therefore, the average inventory per unit time,E[I(t)]tast→∞, is equal toE[I]E[T]. Using (2.13) and (2.14) we have that the average inventory per unit time is:I^=Q2(τu-τl)2+λ(τu-τl)Q[(τu-τ¯)2+2(τu-τ¯)L2+(τ¯-τl)2]+λ2[(τu-τ¯)2+(τu-τ¯)L2]22[Q(τu-τl)2+λ(τu-τl)[(τu-τ¯)2+(τu-τ¯)L2]]The expected total cost per cycle is composed of the expected fixed order cost, expected holding cost and expected purchasing cost.UsingA1as the cost of placing an order via mode 1 andA‾as the incremental cost of placing a second order via mode 2, the expected fixed order cost is:A1P{L1⩽τ¯-L2}+(A‾+A1)P{L1>τ¯-L2}.Substituting the probability values, we obtain an expected fixed order cost ofA1+A‾τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl.The expected total inventory holding cost per cycle ishQ22λ+Q2(τu-τl)(τu-τ¯)2+2(τu-τ¯)L2+(τ¯-τl)2+λ[(τu-τ¯)2+(τu-τ¯)L2]22(τu-τl)2.The expected purchasing cost in a cycle is given byc1QP{L1⩽τ¯-L2}+(c1Q+c2λ(τu-τ¯))P{L1>τ¯-L2}.Substituting the probability values, we obtain an expected variable purchase cost per cycle ofQc1+λ(τu-τ¯)c2τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl.Adding the expected fixed order cost, expected holding cost and expected purchase cost, we obtain the following expression for the total cost per cycle:TCII=A1+A‾τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl+Qc1+λ(τu-τ¯)c2τu-τ¯+L2τu-τl+hQ22λ+Q2(τu-τl)[(τu-τ¯)2+2(τu-τ¯)L2+(τ¯-τl)2]+λ[(τu-τ¯)2+(τu-τ¯)L2]22(τu-τl)2.The expected cost per unit time, which we denote byGII, is equal to the expected total cost per cycle divided by the expected cycle length, and we therefore have:(2.15)GII(Q,β)=2λA1Δτ2+2λA‾Δτ(β+L2)+2λΔτ2Qc12[QΔτ2+λΔτ(β2+βL2)]+2λ2Δτβ(β+L2)c2+hQ2Δτ2+λ2h(β2+βL2)22[QΔτ2+λΔτ(β2+βL2)]+hλΔτQ[β2+2βL2+(Δτ-β)2]2[QΔτ2+λΔτ(β2+βL2)],whereβ=τu-τ¯,Δτ=τu-τl, andΔc=c2-c1. Note thatλβis the quantity ordered via mode 2 when this order is placed. The decision variables in the above expected cost equation are therefore Q andβ.In order to show the convexity ofGIIas a function of Q, we consider its second derivative, which is given by∂2GII∂Q2=λ2hΔτ(β2+βL2)(2βΔτ-Δτ2)+2λ2Δτ2(β2+βL2)Δc[QΔτ+λ(β2+βL2)]3+2λΔτ2(ΔτA1+A‾(β+L2))[QΔτ+λ(β2+βL2)]3.It is straightforward to show that the denominator of∂2GII∂Q2is positive∀Q>0andβ>0, and the numerator is non-negative if:(2.16)A1+A‾pβp⩾ω-λhβ,wherep=τu-τ¯+L2Δτis the probability that an order is placed via mode 2. Note that (2.16) provides a convexity condition forGIIas a function of Q for anyβ, and therefore we need to find the valueQβ∗for minimizingGIIβ(Q)for any givenβ, whereβ∈(0,Δτ-L2](using, e.g., gradient search techniques). Then, in order to find the optimal values ofQ∗andβ∗we defineGII∗=minQ>0{GIIQβ∗,β∀β∈(0,Δτ-L2]}. Althoughβis a continuous variable that corresponds to the length of time during which the order shipped via mode 2 should cover demand, we will assume that it is sufficient to consider a discrete set of candidate values forβ(typically in practice the value ofβwill be measured in some discrete measure of time, such as days).We can see that the convexity condition forGII(Q)is not restrictive by observing that wheneverω⩽0(from Eq. (2.5)), i.e., when mode 1 is the preferred single mode, then (2.16) will always hold. We also note that the left-hand side of (2.16) is the expected order cost in a cycle divided by the expected extra time in the cycle if an order is placed via mode 2; the left-hand side is therefore an upper bound on the fixed order cost per unit time. The right-hand side of the inequality is less thanω, the amount by which the cost of buffering the uncertainty using mode 1 exceeds the cost of buffering the uncertainty using mode 2. Therefore, even if mode 1 is not the preferred single mode of operation, it is not unlikely for condition (2.16) to hold for a broad range of practical cases.Since we assume thatτuis a step function of Q such thatτu=τuiifqi⩽Q<qi+1, fori=1,2,…,n, whereqi<qi+1,τui<τui+1, and n is the number of intervals for Q, we follow the same procedure to find the minimum average cost that we developed in the previous section. In Algorithm 2 (see Appendix E) we present the procedure to find the minimum average inventory cost for the dual-mode model whenτ¯∈[τl+L2,τu].This section reports results of a set of numerical tests that characterize the benefits of the dual-mode model. While we show numerous cases in which the dual-mode model outperforms the better of the two single mode solutions, we also analyze how changes in model parameters affect the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model (recall that the minimum dual-mode average inventory cost equalsG∗=minGI∗,GII∗).Since the average purchasing cost per year is at leastλc1(whether we use the single or dual-mode model), to compare the results of the dual-mode model against the single-mode model, we subtractλc1from the average inventory cost for both models. Therefore we will compare the percentage cost reduction over the inventory costs that can be modified when using an alternative ordering policy. Hence, the percentage cost reduction is given by:%CR=min{G1,G2}-G∗min{G1,G2}-λc1×100%,whereGiis the minimum average inventory cost per unit time when the order is shipped by mode i exclusively,i={1,2}andG∗is the minimum average inventory cost for the dual-mode model. We are of course particularly interested in characterizing conditions under which%CR>0.For our numerical analysis, we created problem instances with parameter values similar to the cost structures that can be observed in practice, and where we can demonstrate the different effects that changes in a particular parameter may have for the dual-mode model. Table 1shows the base parameter values used for the numerical analysis of our proposed model.For the fixed order cost, we assume that the fixed cost for mode 1,A1, is less than or equal to the fixed order cost of mode 2,A2. Also, assuming that orders can be placed with the same supplier, but using different shipping modes, we have thatA1+A‾⩽A1+A2, whereA‾is the additional order cost of placing a second expedited order, since a portion of the fixed order cost was already incurred when the first order was placed.Before analyzing the effects of key parameters on the dual-mode model, we discuss properties of optimal solutions for our proposed model. As we can see, based on the results in Tables 2–8, we observe that for increasing values ofΔc, the value ofτ¯∗is non-decreasing (and the order size with supply mode 2 is non-increasing), until it reaches its maximum value,τ¯∗=τu, at which point the order size with supply mode 2 is zero. This means that in cases where the additional unit purchasing cost for using the more reliable mode is sufficiently small, it is optimal to always utilize both suppliers during each replenishment cycle, and consequentlyτ¯∗∈[L2,τl+L2). AsΔcincreases, the use of shipping mode 2 becomes more expensive, and therefore, the model will increase the value ofτ¯∗(decreasing the mode 2 order size), such that the probability of placing an order with delivery mode 2 is strictly less than one, and therefore,τ¯∗∈(τl+L2,τu].However, even when supply mode 2 is the preferred single supplier mode, i.e.,G2<G1, andΔc=0, we find some cases where it is not optimal to use supply mode 2 with probability one in every replenishment cycle, i.e.,τ¯∗∈[τl+L2,τu), as shown in Tables 2 and 3. In other words, even though mode 2 is the cheaper single mode option, it is not optimal to maximize the size of the order with supplier 2 in our dual-mode model. This occurs because whenΔτis sufficiently large, placing a large order with supplier 2 implies a smaller value ofτ¯∗(since the order with supply mode 2 is equal toλ(τu-τ¯∗)), and therefore an earlier decision time,τ¯∗-L2, on whether to place the second order. As a result, the probability of placing an order with supply mode 2 increases, as well as the expected cost of holding this order in inventory.Since we do not have closed-form expressions for the optimal values ofQ∗andβ∗for the dual-mode model, we perform numerical tests to evaluate how changes in key model parameters for modes 1 and 2 may affect the optimal solution of the dual-mode model and its performance relative the single-mode model. Sections 3.1–3.8 show how changes in a single parameter of interest influence the relative performance of the dual-mode model, all else being equal. Following this, in Section 3.9 we compare the results of the dual-mode model under various combinations of mode delivery lead time and variable cost.In order to analyze the effects of changes in the value of the lower limit on the lead time for delivery mode 1,τl, we performed numerical tests where we increased the value ofτlwhile holding all other parameters equal. Whenτlincreases (for a fixedτu), the mode 1 lead time uncertainty decreases, and therefore, the need for an emergency supplier also decreases. As a result, for increasingτlwe expect to observe a decrease in the order size with delivery mode 2,λβ, and therefore, an increase inτ¯∗. Since an increase inτlrepresents a decrease inΔτ, we also expect to see a decrease in average inventory cost. Table 2 shows the optimal solutions for the dual-mode model and single-mode models and%CR, for increasing values ofτl.As expected, we see a decrease in the order placed with delivery mode 2, except in cases whenΔc=0. In this example, whenΔc=0it is beneficial to increase the use of mode 2, since we can benefit from using a more reliable mode without paying a premium in purchasing cost, and we thus observe increasing values for the size of the second order,λβ. We also see a decrease in the average inventory cost per unit time, although the effect on%CRwill depend on which supply mode has the lower average inventory cost. The average cost of mode 1 decreases as we increaseτl, since there is a reduction in the uncertainty in the order arrival time, and therefore, in the safety stock required. The reduction inG1is greater than the reduction in average inventory cost of the dual-mode model,G∗, and therefore, whenG1<G2, the value of%CRdecreases as we reduce the uncertainty in mode 1 lead time, making the dual-mode model relatively less attractive for increasing values ofτl. Because an increase inτldoes not affect the cost of mode 2, whenG2<G1, an increasing value ofτlleads to an increase in%CR, sinceG∗decreases.When we increaseτuwhile holding all other parameters equal, we increase the uncertainty of mode 1. As a result we expect to see an increase in the amount shipped via mode 2, since the dual-mode model will attempt to mitigate the impact of the increased uncertainty inL1by using mode 2. Note also that an increase in the uncertainty in the arrival time of an order placed with supply mode 1 will increase the average inventory cost of mode 1 exclusively, as well as the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model, although it will not affect the inventory cost associated with using mode 2 exclusively.Table 3 shows the effect that increasingτuhas on the dual-mode model and the single-mode model, for a specific instance. As expected, for increasing values ofτuwe observe an increase in the order placed with mode 2 and an increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model,G∗. Note that whenΔc=0, the increase inτu(and therefore, inΔτ) has a different effect on the quantity ordered by modes 1 and 2. As mentioned previously, whenΔc=0and for large values ofΔτwhenG2<G1, the dual-mode model will try to reduce the probability of using mode 2 by choosingτ¯∗∈[τl+L2,τu), and therefore, reducingλβ. Also, for increasing values ofΔτ, the lower limit on the order placed with mode 1 in order to avoid order crossing,Q⩾Δτ(see Appendix A) increases, and therefore, this minimum order size constraint is satisfied at equality. We observe that the effect of increasingτuon%CRwill depend on which supplier has the lower average inventory cost. Since the average inventory cost of using mode 1 exclusively increases at a faster rate than the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model,G∗, whenG1<G2,%CRwill increase. However, whenG2<G1, the percentage cost reduction will decrease, sinceG2is independent ofτu.We next discuss the effect of increasingL2(while keeping the other parameters equal) on the dual-mode model. AsL2increases, the time at which we must decide on whether to place the second order,τ¯-L2, will be earlier in the cycle, and therefore, the probability of placing the second order will increase. We can view the increase inL2as a decrease in the responsiveness of delivery mode 2, and as a result, the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model will increase, and the model will be less beneficial. Table 4 shows the effect of the increase inL2on the performance of the dual-mode model. As expected, the average inventory cost of our proposed model increases for increasing values ofL2, and since the average inventory cost of the single-mode model is independent ofL2, we observe a decrease in%CR.In order to evaluate how the demand rate affects the performance of the dual-mode model we performed numerical tests where we increased the value ofλ, while holding other parameters equal.As the demand rate increases we expect to observe an increase in the total quantity ordered through modes 1 and 2, i.e.,Q+λβ, and an increase in the average inventory cost for the dual-mode model as well as for the single-mode model.Table 5 shows the optimal solution and average inventory cost for the dual-mode model and single-mode model for increasing values of demand rate. Note that for these instances, because the demand rates used were less than the base value of 10,000, we modified the break points at whichτuincreases for increasing values of Q (see the caption of Table 5). This permitted analyzing solutions with different values ofτu, and showing how the value ofλaffects the value ofτ¯in the optimal solution.We observed that for increasing values ofλ, whenG1<G2, the value of%CRincreases. Although we have not been able to prove it analytically, the reason is that for increasing values ofλ, the average inventory cost for supply mode 1 increases at a faster rate than the average inventory cost for the dual-mode model,G∗. The opposite happens when we increaseλandG2<G1. SinceG∗increases at a faster rate than the average inventory cost for supply mode 2, the value of%CRwill decrease.To evaluate the effect of the holding cost per unit per unit time in the dual-mode model, we performed numerical tests where we increased the value of h and held the rest of the parameters fixed.Table 6 shows the order quantities and average inventory cost for the single-mode model and the dual-mode model. We observe that when h increases, the total quantity ordered in the dual-mode model,Q+λβ, decreases and the average inventory cost increases. Through our numerical tests, we cannot predict the effects of the increase of h on%CR, however, as this will depend on the value of h relative to the other parameters.Next, we wish to understand how computing the holding cost as a percentage of the item’s variable purchase cost might affect our results. To do this, we first calculated the holding cost per unit time as a percentage of the purchase cost of supply mode 1 exclusively. We then compared this to the case in which the holding cost is computed as a percentage of the value of each item, which depends on whether the item was purchased using supply mode 1 or supply mode 2, assuming a first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory policy. In order to estimate these costs, we used a simulation-based optimization model to estimate the average inventory costs per unit time for our model.Table 7 shows the results for these two cases and the difference in their average inventory costs as a percentage of the average inventory cost for our dual-mode model, where the holding cost is calculated as a percentage of the purchasing cost of mode 1. As expected, the difference increases for increasing values ofc2. For every instance, however, this difference is less than 0.05%, and therefore, we conclude that our assumption of a holding cost that is independent of the supply mode has little impact on the results of the model.When the incremental fixed order cost for using shipping mode 2 in the dual-mode model increases, while holding all other parameters fixed, we expect to observe an increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model, since it is more expensive to place a second order.Since the average inventory cost for the single-mode model is independent of the extra fixed order cost of placing a second order, as we increaseA‾the value of%CRwill decrease, making the dual-mode model less beneficial. Table 8 shows the results of our numerical tests when we increase the value ofA‾.When we increase the purchasing cost per unit for supply mode 2, and keep all other parameters fixed, we expect to observe an increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model. Tables 2–6 and Table 8 show the optimal solution for the dual-mode model and single-mode model for different values ofc2.We observe that although it may be intuitive to conclude that as we increasec2the use of the dual-mode model will become less attractive, this is not always the case. The impact of the change inc2depends on which shipping mode has the minimum cost when they are used independently. When shipping mode 2 is the preferred supply mode, as we increasec2, the cost of using it exclusively also increases, but at a faster rate than the increase in the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model,G∗, and therefore the percentage cost reduction obtained by using the dual-mode model increases with increasing values ofc2.This increasing trend in%CRstops whenc2is large enough to make mode 1 the new preferred shipping mode. When mode 1 is the preferred single supply mode, as we increasec2, the value ofG1does not change, and%CRdecreases. Therefore the maximum%CRfor increasing values ofc2is reached at the maximum value ofc2such thatG2⩽G1.For the development of our model we assumed that the lead time for supply mode 1 is Uniformly distributed. When the mode 1 lead time follows a Uniform Distribution,L1∼U(τl,τu), the probability density of an order arrival at time t is equal for any timet∈[τl,τu], and the expected arrival time isE[L1]=τl+τu2, which is equal to the midpoint of the interval.We are interested in the effects that using a non-Uniform distribution for the mode 1 lead time has on the dual-mode model. In particular, we assume thatL1∼{τl+ΔτBeta(a,b)}1We defineL1as a scaled Beta variable, since the Beta distribution is defined on the interval[0,1]and we are interested in general cases whereL1∈[τl,τu].1wherea=2andb>2, and therefore the distribution is unimodal and positively skewed. Under this assumption the probability of having an early arrival (before the middle point of the interval) is higher than when a Uniformly distributed lead time is assumed.Since we can no longer use the expressions found in Section 2, in order to find the optimal solution for the dual-mode model when we use a Beta distribution forL1, we need to use a simulation-based optimization approach; in particular, we used the commercial package OptQuest from Arena.Table 9shows the optimal values and average inventory costs for the single-mode model and dual-mode model when we assume thatL1∼{τl+ΔτBeta(a,b)}. The last two columns of Table 9 show the%CRvalues for the different assumptions for the distribution ofL1.We observe that we obtain higher%CRvalues when we assume thatL1follows a Beta distribution, and the reasons for this are twofold: first, the average inventory cost of using supply mode 1 exclusively is higher when we use a positive skewed Beta distribution forL1, compared with the average inventory cost of assuming a Uniformly distributed lead time. This is because the expected arrival time whenL1∼{τl+ΔτBeta(a,b)}is less thanτl+τu2, and therefore, the holding cost due to safety stock (λτu-λE[L1]) is increased under the Beta distribution (when compared to the Uniform); second, since the probability of an early arrival is higher when we assume thatL1follows a Beta distribution, compared with the use of the Uniform distribution, the probability of placing the second order with supply mode 2 decreases, and therefore, the average total cost of using the dual-mode model will decrease.In practice we expect thatL1follows a probability distribution with some positive skew, since the unusually long cases typically lead to a skew in the distribution. Hence, based on the previous analysis, we can expect to have higher%CRvalues than the ones observed under the assumption of a Uniformly distributed lead time, and therefore, the dual-mode model may be more beneficial in practice.The analysis discussed in the previous sections shows how certain parameter changes affect the benefits of the dual-mode model. This section considers how a buyer might evaluate multiple supply mode options, where a given mode implies certain costs and lead-time distribution characteristics. That is, all else being equal, we would like to know how to choose from different supply alternatives. For example, using the instances in Fig. 10, we can see how the buyer might compare different deterministic supply modes that can be used as secondary sourcing, with different combinations of purchasing costs and lead times.In Fig. 10 we observe that choosing the supply mode with the shortest lead time, while keeping the other parameters equal, will provide the biggest%CRvalue. However, in practice, a reduction in the lead time corresponds to an increase in the unit purchasing cost. As a result it may be more beneficial to choose a shipping mode with a longer lead time but with a reduced unit purchasing cost. Using our model and with this type of analysis, a buyer can negotiate purchasing costs based on delivery times.Next we would like to compare different supply modes with different uncertainty levels. The curves in Fig. 11represent different shipping modes with Uniformly distributed lead times, each with the same mean, but with different values of variance (whereΔτ=41days for the base case). This means that we will compare shipping modes with equal values for the expected arrival time, but with different values of uncertainty,Δτ.Although intuition suggests that the dual-mode model will be more beneficial as the uncertainty in the lead time of shipping mode 1 increases, this is not always the case. As we can observe in Fig. 11, whenΔc=0we obtain the highest%CRvalue for the instances with the smallest values of uncertainty (Δτ=29days). The reason for this is that, for these instances, whenΔc=0, mode 2 is the preferred supplier (G2<G1), and therefore, as we decreaseΔτthe average inventory cost for supply mode 2 does not change, while the average inventory cost of the dual-mode model decreases, and consequently%CRincreases. Please refer to Section 3.1 for a more detailed explanation.Next we consider the dual-mode model for different modes with Uniformly distributed lead times and equal uncertainty levels, but increasing values of the expected delivery time. This means that we are comparing shipping modes with equal values ofΔτ, but increasing values ofE[L1], while holding all other parameters equal. Fig. 12shows the results, whereE[L1]=34.5days for the base case.Note that the average inventory cost of using mode 2 exclusively is independent ofE[L1]; and therefore for instances with different expected lead times for supply mode 1, the value ofG2will not change.For the single-mode model when we use mode 1 exclusively, in order to avoid stockouts we need an order size at least as great as the reorder point, i.e.,Q⩾λτu; therefore for increasing values ofE[L1], the right hand side of the inequality increases and we will have increasing values ofG1.As expected, we have increasing values of%CRfor increasingE[L1]. Note that whenΔc=0we have some cases when the%CRvalues are equal for differentE[L1]. There are two reasons for this: first, whenΔc=0supply mode 2 is chosen as the preferred single supplier (G2<G1), and therefore, we will compare the dual-mode model against the same value of average inventory cost for the single-mode model, for different values ofE[L1]; and second, for small values ofL2the constraint on order size to avoid order crossing,Q⩾λΔτ, is more restrictive thanQ⩾λτ¯, and therefore for different values ofE[L1]and equal values ofΔτ, the values of Q andλβare equal for different instances, which results in the same average inventory cost for the dual-mode model.As our results have shown, the proposed model presents saving opportunities for the buyer who uses a single source, and it can be used in a joint manner with the supplier to achieve inventory cost reductions for the buyer and better resource allocation for the supplier.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
When allocating orders to suppliers, there is often a tradeoff between cost and delivery performance. The use of a cheaper supply mode often implies dealing with higher uncertainty levels when compared with a more expensive mode. Assuming that shortages are highly undesirable, if a cheap and less reliable delivery mode is used, it may be beneficial to consider supplementing this with a secondary supply mode that is more reliable (and therefore more expensive). This paper focused on the benefits of this dual-mode ordering strategy by modeling a buyer’s ordering decisions with two delivery mode options. Our model allowed us to characterize the benefits of the dual-mode supply strategy and compare the optimal dual-mode policy with the better of the two single-supplier solutions.Using numerical analysis, we characterized situations under which the use of the dual-mode model is preferred over the single-mode model. We observed increasing benefits in our model for increasing values of the mean and variance of the lead time of the less reliable supply mode (assuming that supply mode 1 is used as the preferred single-mode supplier). We also observed that when the supply mode 1 lead time follows a positively skewed probability distribution, which is typically a more realistic assumption than a Uniform lead time, the percentage cost reduction due to the dual-mode operation is greater compared with the results when we assume that supply mode 1 lead time is Uniformly distributed.Our model can be used by a manager who wants to analyze different combinations of shipping modes in order to minimize inventory costs while guaranteeing zero stockouts. Our work shows that a supplier that offers different shipping mode options with different delivery costs and reliability levels may provide additional value to potential buyers. Further research may consider different supplier pricing and incentives. For example, in order to increase the utilization of shipping modes with available capacity, a supplier might offer quantity discounts for the use of those modes, making shipping diversification more attractive for the buyer. Finally, we note that one dimension our model does not account for is the risk preference of the decision maker, effectively assuming that the buyer is risk neutral. An interesting extension of our work may include accounting for the way in which different buyer risk profiles influence the allocation of order quantities to different supply modes.
