@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The spatial variation of cell size in a functionally graded cellular structure is achieved using error diffusion to convert a continuous tone image into binary form. Effects of two control parameters, greyscale value and resolution on the resulting cell size measures were investigated. Variation in cell edge length was greatest for the Voronoi connection scheme, particularly at certain parameter combinations. Relationships between these parameters and cell size were identified and applied to an example, where the target was to control the minimum and maximum cell size. In both cases there was an 8% underestimation of cell area for target regions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cellular structures, also commonly described as lattice structures, consist of a number of connected members or tessellated unit cells that form a complex structural network. Modern manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing (AM), enable the fabrication of highly complex small to medium sized parts which can include cellular structures. Large scale truss structures are commonly seen in architectural applications where strength and stiffness can be combined with freedom of design. Smaller scale structures have other potential applications such as tailored impact absorption capacity [1–3] and heat dissipation [1,4–11]. An example of such a structure manufactured using an AM process: selective laser melting (SLM) is shown in Fig. 1. This demonstrates a regular tessellation of a unit cell connected to an outer skin. The outer skin can be useful to provide mating faces for adjacent parts, to provide protection for the cellular structure and for maintenance reasons. In this case, a solid outer skin has been used; however, other forms of skin may also be used, where appropriate, such as a ‘net’ skin [2,3].Compared to many other manufacturing methods, AM has a comparatively inexpensive cost of complexity [12], and this can actually decrease as part complexity increases as the necessity for support structure for SLM can reduce. The design of these structures, however, remains a challenge. With increased geometric complexity comes increased design complexity, and this is exacerbated when including computational analysis methods and mathematical optimisation techniques in the design process [13–15]. Hence, there is a general requirement for efficient methods for the design and analysis of cellular structures.This paper focuses on the problem of generating a cellular structure with a spatial variation in the cell size. Different regions of a component generally require different extents of internal structure support. With a fixed, uniformly tessellated cellular structure, this variation can only be achieved by varying the structural member dimensions, which leads to a large number of design variables. As the variation in functionality can only be achieved by varying structural member dimensions, this is restricted by the unit cell size defined prior to optimisation. In addition, some efforts have been made to vary the individual cell design such that the structure is constructed of differing cells [16]; however, this has many challenges and still does not address the cell size variation. This leads us to consider how the design space could be explored more fully by allowing variation of the cell sizes. Some existing cellular structure design approaches do exhibit different sized cells as a by-product of requiring the structure to conform to a shape with curved faces; instead of trimming tessellated cells to this shape, they are either swept [17] or based upon an unstructured mesh [18]; however, these variations are slight.A novel method is proposed that employs dithering (also known as half-toning) method to achieve spatial variation of cells and subsequent control over component behaviour. Learning from developments linking dithering to meshing techniques [19–22], the dithering defines spatially varying points which are then connected with structural members. These points determine the spatial variation of the cell sizes (area/volume). This paper first introduces the error diffusion methodology used for dithering, and then applies this to some examples to demonstrate the functionality using two point connection schemes. The relationships between the method parameters and the resulting cell size are investigated and their use for controlling cell size and distribution demonstrated.
