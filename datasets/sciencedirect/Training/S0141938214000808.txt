@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Thin amorphous silicon (a-Si) films were crystallized into polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) by combining solid phase crystallization (SPC) and subsequent excimer laser annealing (ELA). Then thin film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated by using the poly-Si formed in the single and double excimer laser scanned area. The device performance of the TFTs fabricated with the excimer laser energy density of 230mJ/cm2 is almost equal for the single and double scanned area. This observation indicates that the overlapping laser irradiation with the laser energy density below 230mJ/cm2 does not change the characteristics of TFTs. Based on this result, we discuss the correlation between performance of active matrix organic light emitting display (AMOLED) panels and excimer laser energy density during ELA for SPC treated and non-treated poly-Si films.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Use of low temperature processed poly-Si TFTs has been drawing an increasing interest for applications in large-area display electronics. The performance of TFTs is influenced by several factors, including gate insulator (GI), interface state between poly-Si and GI, activation, and hydrogenation. One of the critical steps in the fabrication of poly-Si TFTs is transforming amorphous silicon (a-Si) active area into poly-Si. Typically, poly-Si films are obtained either via directed deposition of poly-Si films using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or via crystallization of a-Si by thermal or laser annealing. Among these various methods to crystallize a-Si, ELA has attracted much research interest as an alternative low-temperature processing method to crystallize a-Si films.The TFT uniformity issue about the overlapped area of excimer laser scans on a-Si layers has been investigated by Chang et al. [1]. They found that the higher excimer laser energy density dominates ELA-TFT characteristics, and the device performance in the overlap laser scanned area can be good as that in the non-overlapped area. Some attempts to improve the TFT performance by ELA process for SPC treated poly-Si films have been also proposed. Kodama et al. [2] have reported that the mobility is improved compared to the conventional TFTs. They also found that the mobility are same for both p- and n-channel TFTs, fabricated with the excimer laser energy densities ranging from 230 to 307mJ/cm2 and from 230 to 420mJ/cm2 for the 80nm and 120nm thick SPC treated poly-Si films, respectively. Recently, Jin et al. have reported the material properties of ELA processed poly-Si films and also enhanced electrical performance of TFTs formed in the single and double (overlap) scanned area along the long axis direction at various energy densities [3]. They found that the device performances were approximately equal to each region for the low excimer laser energy density (200mJ/cm2) processed TFTs. This fact indicates that the overlapped laser irradiation during ELA does not change the characteristics of TFTs while non-uniform line images were observed with a higher excimer laser energy density. Although the alteration of material properties of poly-Si films due to the high laser energy density during ELA was suggested as an origin of observed non-uniformity, it is not clear thus far how TFT parameters are evaluated with the excimer laser density and affect on AMOLED.In this work, SPC process to improve TFTs performance is initially used to produce poly-Si films with very large but defect-rich grains, and subsequently ELA is processed to reduce in-grain defects, keeping the large grain size [4]. We analyze the correlations between the performance of AMOLED panels and irradiated excimer laser energy densities on SPC treated poly-Si films during ELA process in the single and double (overlap) scanned area.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Thin a-Si films were crystallized into poly-Si films by combining SPC method and subsequent ELA process with various laser energy densities (210, 230, 250, 270, and 290mJ/cm2). We found that the device performance of SPC+ELA poly-Si films formed with the excimer laser energy density of 230mJ/cm2 is approximately equal at the single and double scanned regions while the different characteristics are observed for the higher excimer laser energy density. These observations indicate that the overlapping irradiation does not change the characteristics of TFTs. The 2.8-inch AMOLED panel was demonstrated successfully without any non-uniform line images with the excimer laser energy density of 230mJ/cm2 while a non-uniformity was exhibited for higher excimer laser energy density. These observations clearly clarify that the electrical device parameters of TFTs directly affect the brightness and resultant uniformity of AMOLED.
