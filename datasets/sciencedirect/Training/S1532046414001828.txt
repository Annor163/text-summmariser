@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we describe an efficient tool based on natural language processing for classifying the detail state of pulmonary embolism (PE) recorded in CT pulmonary angiography reports. The classification tasks include: PE present vs. absent, acute PE vs. others, central PE vs. others, and subsegmental PE vs. others. Statistical learning algorithms were trained with features extracted using the NLP tool and gold standard labels obtained via chart review from two radiologists. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the four tasks were 0.998, 0.945, 0.987, and 0.986, respectively. We compared our classifiers with bag-of-words Naive Bayes classifiers, a standard text mining technology, which gave AUC 0.942, 0.765, 0.766, and 0.712, respectively.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes [1,2] with an overall mortality rate exceeding 10% [3]. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) directly visualizes emboli as filling defects and is the first-line imaging modality to evaluate patients with a clinical suspicion of acute PE [4]. As single center studies are rarely greater than 1000 patients [5–12] and do not account for variability between institutions, the establishment of large, multicenter, multinational databases will be advantageous to the research in PE. In order to facilitate a clinical study, positive PE cases need to be separated from the negative ones. Moreover, characteristics of PE, for example, the chronicity and the location of emboli, are also important information useful for clinical studies on subtypes of PE. Using diagnosis codes (e.g., ICD-9/ICD-10 codes) is one possible way to collect PE cases. However, the codes are not accurately reported to identify PE or to distinguish PE from deep vein thrombosis [13–16], and neither do they contain information on PE characteristics. To obtain detailed information on findings of PE, including its presence, as well as characteristics, we must rely on the description in the CTPA reports. However, extracting these information by manual chart review is too time-consuming and labor-intensive to be a viable approach to identify a large number of specific types of PE patients for research purposes. A reliable system that extracts information from CTPA reports automatically and accurately is expected to have significant impact on clinical research.Natural language processing (NLP) is a promising technology for this information extraction task. The technology is not mature yet, as the prevalence of word sense ambiguity, shorthands (including symbols), and free mixing of language and semi-structured tables (plain text made to look tabular by using tabs, white spaces, or other symbols, whose semantics are fundamentally different from language) in general clinical notes still pose considerable difficulty to their interpretation [17–24]. However, diagnostic radiology reports are an ideal target for employing NLP, because they are composed almost purely of natural language, and they have a constrained vocabulary and a limited number of concepts for each imaging modality, so ambiguity is not very common.A number of NLP software have been applied to radiology reports over the past thirty years. The Special Purpose Radiology Understanding System, focused on analyzing radiology reports were implemented at the LDS Hospital in Utah [25]. This was followed by the Medical Language Extraction and Encoding System [26], focused initially on chest X-ray reports [27]. An information theory-based algorithm was validated on radiology reports [28]. A comparison of two specific algorithms [29] also confirmed that both machine learning and rule-based approaches, both popular in NLP, could perform well in analyzing radiology reports. Notably, their machine learning algorithm was trained on discharge summaries and showed excellent portability on radiology reports. Recent literature reports the application of NLP to identify the presence of PE from CTPA reports [30,31], the chronicity of PE, and the diagnostic quality of the exam [31].It is hard not to notice that there has been no peer-reviewed report on the use of NLP to extract the most proximal location of the emboli in the pulmonary arterial tree. The location of PE is important. Massive central PE increases the risk of right ventricular overload and PE-related mortality [32,33], and the clinical significance and risk–benefit ratio of treatment of isolated subsegmental PE (ISSPE) has been questioned due to limited data on the natural history and outcomes of these relatively uncommon single peripheral clots [34,35]. One reason of this omission is that previous NLP technologies do not directly support such analysis. Several software, such as MedLEE [26] and cTAKES [36,37], can associate findings with locations if both are mentioned in a sentence. However, when radiologists describe, for example, a subsegmental embolus, arteries of segments and lobes are usually mentioned together, and previous technology do not allow us to distinguish whether the PE is subsegmental, segmental, or lobar. We built our program on top of the Narrative Information Linear Extraction (NILE) system [38]. NILE is an NLP library for semantic analysis of clinical narratives, and is developed upon the principles of linear interpretation using rules based on linguistic and clinical knowledge. One notable feature of NILE is that its location analyzer generates a nested modification structure that clarifies the relations among the multiple anatomical locations mentioned in a sentence. We utilized this feature as well as others to extract information of the presence, chronicity, and proximal extension of PE, and achieved satisfying accuracy.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the composition of our program for the extraction of information related to PE presence, chronicity and proximal extension, including the dictionary, variables, and algorithms that we used. Section 3 validates the classification output of our program against gold standard labels obtained from expert chart reviews, and compares its accuracy with the bag-of-words model — a standard and usually effective text mining approach. Section 4 discusses the advantages of the proposed tool for PE classification and the limitations of the current technology.
