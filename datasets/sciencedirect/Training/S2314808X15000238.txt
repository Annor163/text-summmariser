@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Five marine teleost fishes inhabiting different marine depths namely Hippocampus hippocampus (Linnaeus, 1758), Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792), Gobius niger (Linnaeus, 1758), Mullus barbatus barbatus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Solea solea (Linnaeus, 1758) were used in the present study. Their retinae and lenses were subjected for histological, scanning electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE and isoenzyme electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase, malate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The present findings showed variant histological structures with characteristic photoreceptors mainly of either rods for H. hippocampus, M. barbatus and S. solea or cones in S. pilchardus. Mixed photoreceptors are identified in G. niger. The fishes exhibited diversity in protein band expression coincides with change of pattern orientation in lens fibers arrangement and histological structures of retina. Isoenzyme electrophoresis of estimated isoenzyme showed differences between lens and retina of fishes especially H. hippocampus.It can be concluded that the retina and lens of the studied teleost fishes showed apparent varying structure reflecting the isoenzyme characteristic for preserving functional characteristic of vision according to the marine habitat depths.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Vision is an important sense organ. Similar to other land vertebrates, fishes have oval lens and retina with characteristics rod and/or cone photoreceptors (ectopic or photopic vision) [1–3]. Fish vision is markedly adapted to their aquatic environment especially at deep sea where eyes suited to its dark level [4]. Aquatic marine environment absorb light which is gradually decrease with increasing depth become blue at 50 m [5]. Marine teleost fishes inhabiting different depths of marine environment displayed varying optometric [6] and retinal structures [7,8].In poor light at deep surfaces, teleost fishes used monofocal lens beside monochromatic retina such as the South American cichlid fish Aequidens pulcher (blue acara) which showed adaptive changes of lens during day and night [9] as well as exhibited retinomotor movements [10,11]. Multifocal lenses were observed in diurnal and nocturnal coral reef fishes. The properties of the lens seemed to be specifically adapted to the visual needs of each species [12]. Also, the retina of deep sea living fishes showed adapted retina with more than visual pigments such as stomiid dragonfishes, which uniquely produce far red bioluminescence from suborbital photophores [13].The distribution of lens protein and the refractive indices of fishes attracted the attention of many authors. Pierscionek and Augusteyn [14] mentioned that a high content of gamma-crystallins is found in lenses which have refractive index gradients. SDS-PAGE profiles of soluble lens nuclear proteins of Clarias batrachus (Linn.) revealed the presence of eight distinct polymorphs along the western region of Uttar Pradesh, India. β- and γ-crystallins were identified according to their molecular weights and isoelectric points [15].The present study aimed to evaluate the diversity of retinal and lenticular structure and function in five marine teleost fishes inhabiting different marine depths.Selected teleost fishes were collected from Mediterranean sea regions around Port Said in the Northeast of Egypt. The captured fishes collected were of almost relatively similar sizes. The investigated fishes are:1.Hippocampus hippocampus(Linnaeus, 1758), Order Syngnathiformes, Family Syngnathidae. It lives at depth range of 14–40 m [16].Sardina pilchardus(Walbaum, 1792), Order Clupeiformes, Family: Clupeidae. The fish lives at depth range of 25–55 m depth [17].Gobius niger (Linnaeus, 1758), Order Perciformes, Family Gobiidae. It lives at depth range from 1 to 75 m [18],Mullus barbatus barbatus(Linnaeus, 1758), Order: Perciformes, Family: Mullidae. It lives at depth up to 100 m [19].Solea solea (Linnaeus, 1758), Order: Pleuronectiformes, Family: Soleidae. It lives at depth around 0–150 m [20].The eyes of the selected fishes were dissected and investigated as follows:Retinal thickness and their layers were measured in investigated fishes by linear ocular micrometers. The ratio relationship between outer and inner nuclear layer were investigated according to Wang et al. [21] to determine the nocturnal or diurnal pattern of the fish. Also, the relationship between ganglion layer and inner nuclear layer was also investigated according to Gu et al. [22] to illustrate the visual acuity.The retinae of the investigated fishes were separated from their lens and immediately fixed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin (pH 7.4). They were then dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene and mounted in molten paraplast at 58–62 °C. Serial 5 μm sagittal histological sections were cut, stained with Haematoxylin and eosin and examined under bright-field light microscopy.Lenses of the examined fishes were separated and immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at (pH 7.4) and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol. The specimens were dried in a carbon dioxide critical point drying apparatus, mounted in stubs and coated with a thin layer of gold by low voltage DC sputtering and investigated under scanning electron microscope JOEL5300 JSM (musashino 3-chome akishima Tokyo 196-8558, Japan).Lenses and retina of the investigated fishes were separated and stored frozen at −20 °C until use. Extraction of protein was carried out and protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. [23] using crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to Laemmli [24]. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant 200 V. The separated proteins were placed on polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (60 mg/l) in an acidic medium for the generation of an electrostatic attraction between the dye molecules and the amino groups of proteins [25].Lens and retina samples were collected, cleaned and homogenized using 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20% sucrose. Protein content was determined according to Lowry et al. [23] and electrophoresis by the method of Laemmli [24]. For visualization of the tested enzymes, the tissue samples were incubated in medium containing the selected substrate of the tested enzyme and visualized materials as follows:Acid phosphatase isoenzymes: Staining was carried out using 30 mg naphthol-AS-MX-phosphate as substrate and 50 ml incubation buffer, 0.25 ml 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.25 ml MnCl2 10%, 5 ml NaCl 20%, and 30 mg fast blue [26].Malic dehydrogenase isoenzymes: Staining solution was carried out by mixing 50 mN Tris–HCl (pH 8.5) 50 ml, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) 10 mg, maleic acid 1 ml (after neutralized with NaOH), nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) 10 mg and phenazine methosulphate (PMS) 2 mg [27].Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: Staining solution was prepared by mixing 50 ml 0.2 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0),50 ml, 10 mg NADP, 10 mg MTT, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), 5 mg and phenazine methosulphate (PMS), 200 mg MgCl2, and 100 mg glucose-6-phosphate [28].Isoenzyme patterns were recorded on the basis of number and the rate of flow (Rf) values of the isoenzyme bands. The Rf value is the mobility of each isoenzyme band that traveled from the origin divided by the distance traveled by the front tracking dye. The presence or absence of a certain isoenzymatic band was considered as a differentiating feature. Zymograms were drawn to scale and relative mobility values were calculated for each band.Data are presented as mean ± standard error. The statistical analysis was performed with multi-variant analysis of variance (MANOVA) using SPSS (version 13) software package for Windows of comparing the multivariations between each investigated fishes in relation with H. hippocampus and considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
