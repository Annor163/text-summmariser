@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The financial lease is an important financing tool by which the lessee can acquire ownership of equipment upon the expiration of the lease after making a series of rent payments for the use of the equipment. In this paper, we consider an online version of this financial lease decision problem in which the decision maker (the lessee) does not know how long he/she will use the equipment. By assuming, the lessee can use the equipment through two options: financial lease or lease; we define and solve this online financial lease decision problem using the competitive analysis method. The optimal online strategies are discussed in each financial lease case with or without down payment. Finally, the optimal strategies are summarized as simple decision rules.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The leasing industry has significant impacts on other industries, and has catalysed economic development in different countries (Peck, 2014; Vance, 2003). To decide if leasing is a profitable financing option, the decision maker should first determine the length of time the equipment will be used. However, in practice, the exact length of time for use of some equipment is usually unavailable, so researchers explore well-established techniques in the fully distribution-free model, i.e., the online model and competitive analysis (Albers, 2003; Borodin & El-Yaniv, 1998), to evaluate their strategies. This technique compares the results obtained with an online strategy to the result that could have been obtained if one had known the exact length of time in advance, with the latter scenario represented by an optimal offline strategy. Thus, the competitive analysis aims is to design an online strategy with the best possible worst-case guarantees. Competitive analysis has been used to study many problems within the fields of finance (El-Yaniv, 1998), operations research (Chen & Wang, 2015; Liu, Chu, Xu, & Zheng, 2010; Zheng, Cheng, Xu, & Liu, 2013) and management science (Larsen & Wøhlk, 2010).Karp first formulated the classic “leasing problem” (a.k.a. the Ski-rental problem) using the following online model and competitive analysis method (Karp, 1992): assume the decision maker has two options, to lease or purchase the equipment. In the purchase option, a one-time cost is incurred, and thereafter usage is free of charge; in the lease option, the cost is proportional to usage time, and there is no one-time cost. The solution is straightforward with competitive ratio 2, i.e., the strategy never pays more than twice the optimum. There have been many generalizations of this simple problem. For example, El-Yaniv, Kaniel, and Linial (1999) incorporated interest rates into the model and determined the optimal online strategies. Irani and Ramanathan (1998) examined a situation in which the price of the equipment fluctuates while the rental cost stays constant. More recently, Lotker, Patt-Shamir, and Rawitz (2008a, 2008b) and Zhang, Ponn, and Xu (2011) proposed the multi-slope ski-rental problem and the multiple discount option ski-rental problem, respectively. Other classic variations of the problem include the replacement problem (El-Yaniv & Karp, 1997), the capital investment problem (Azar et al., 1999) and the Bahncard problem (Fleischer, 2001).The lease option in all of the above research is an operating lease. Operating leases are contracts for rent. At the end of the contract period, the ownership of the rented equipment remains with the rental company. In practice, there is another important leasing category: the financial lease. Typically, in a financial lease, the lessee will find required equipment, and then contact a leasing company (the lessor) to arrange financing. Legal ownership of the equipment remains with the lessor until lease ends, at which time the ownership is transferred to the lessee (Vance, 2003).In this paper, the decision maker has two options, a lease or financial lease, to acquire required equipment. In the former option, the decision maker pays a rental fee for the equipment, whose ownership remains with the rental company at any time. In the latter option, the decision maker either makes or does not make a down payment, and then pays financial lease fees during the length of time of the lease for the equipment, whose ownership will be transferred to the lessee upon the expiration of the lease. The problem then is how to decide the time to switch to a financial lease when the decision maker does not know how long he/she will use the equipment. We will call this problem the online financial lease problem. In this paper, the optimal strategies to solve the online financial lease problem in cases with and without a down payment will be presented, and the optimal strategies will be summarized as simple decision rules.The following example illustrates a typical result based on the analysis presented in this paper.Consider someone wants to use a repertory. There are two options: lease with a rental fee at $2000 per month, or a financial lease with a fee of $3000 per month plus a down payment of $10000 and in 24 months, the ownership will transfer to the lessee. Which policy guarantees the best performance for any possible length of time it is used in terms of a competitive analysis?The following lease strategy guarantees a cost at most of 141.5 percent of the minimal possible cost, for any possible length of time: lease this repertory from the first to the 17th month and use the financial lease thereafter. On the other hand, if the lessee could negotiate with the rental company to decrease the down payment from $10000 to zero, then the strategy to lease this repertory for one year and then use the financial lease the next year can guarantee a maximum cost of 133.3 percent of the minimum possible cost. In addition, the above two percentages are the minimum for each case, i.e., the two strategies are optimal. The details are provided in Sections 5 and 6. Note that there are no assumptions about the distribution of the length of time in use.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the precise definition of the online financial lease problem, the competitive strategy, and the competitive ratio. Section 3 then presents the competitive strategy and the matching lower bound proof for the problem of a financial lease without down payment. Thus, the competitive strategy obtained in this section is optimal. Next, Section 4 describes the optimal competitive strategies for the problem of a financial lease with down payment. We discuss this problem with different cases, and for each we obtain the optimal strategy and optimal competitive ratio. Subsequently, Section 5 summarizes all results and provides simple decision rules for different cases of the online financial leasing problem. The following Section 6 provides numerical analysis results to illustrate the proposed models and strategies. Finally, Section 7 presents the concluding remarks and areas for future research.In this section, we present the precise definition of and notations for the online financial lease problem.Formally, in our problem, the decision maker (the lessee) can use the equipment by lease or financial lease. That is to say, the lessee can lease the equipment at a cost of c per unit time, or can choose to use this equipment with a financial lease and pay b ≥ 0 as a down payment, plus r for each unit time.The following basic assumptions are used in the online financial lease problem,•In financial lease, the lessee will obtain ownership of the equipment after z payments, and then no longer needs to pay the financial lease fees;The lessee can end a financial lease at any time, even just before obtaining ownership of the equipment. When the lessee decides to stop using the equipment within the lease period, the lease is terminated and the lessor is still the legal owner of the equipment, and the lessee does not need to pay the remaining fees;The length of time t for the use of the equipment is unknown.Let A(T) define the strategy wherein the decision maker leases the equipment from the start to time T, and uses a financial lease thereafter, so A(0) represents the strategy that uses a financial lease from the start, and A(∞) indicates a perpetual lease. Note that this notation defines all possible strategies.For an (unknown) length of time to use the equipment t ≥ 0, define CostA(T)(t) as all costs paid by strategy A(T) from the start to t, including, if any, the cost of the financial lease fees at time t. We define Costopt(t) as the minimum cost needed to cover the period from the beginning to t. A strategy A(T) is said to be α-competitive if there exists two constants α, β such that(1)CostA(T)(t)≤αCostopt(t)+βfor all possible t, and this strategy is called an online strategy or a competitive strategy. Thus, our task is to acquire the equipment with minimal α in (1) for any unknown used time length t. All results in this paper hold under the stricter form of competitive analysis in whichβ=0.Since strategy A(T) is only determined by parameter T, then our problem returns to how to determine the decision variable T. All notations introduced above are summarized in Table 1.In this section, we examine the online financial lease problem without down payment, i.e., down paymentb=0. The analysis here illustrates the basic ideas for the subsequent general cases. Without loss generality, we consider r > c, otherwise the lessee should always choose to use the equipment via financial lease. Now, the cost of the optimal offline strategy isCostopt(t)={ct,t<rz/crz,t≥rz/cBefore providing the optimal competitive strategy result, we present Lemmas 1 and 2 as follows.Lemma 1LetT*=(r/c−1)z,the competitive ratio of online strategy A(T*) is2−c/r.Recall that A(T*) represents the strategy using a lease during time T* and then switching to a financial lease from then on. Thus, the cost of strategy A(T*) isCostA(T*)(t)={ct,t<T*cT*+r(t−T*),T*≤t<T*+zcT*+rz,t≥T*+zThen the ratio of costs between the online strategy A(T*) and optimal offline strategy isCostA(T*)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<T*1t(1−rc)T*+rc,T*≤t<z+T*2−cr,t≥z+T*.The above ratio function is a piecewise continuous function, since r > c, the second function is an increasing function of t; thus, whent=z+T*,that ist=rz/c, the above ratio approaches its greatest value2−c/r,meaning the competitive ratio of the online strategy A(T*) is2−c/r. □The lower bound for the online financial lease problem without down payment is2−c/r.For all possible online strategies, set the costs of A(T) asCostA(T)(t)={ct,t<TcT+r(t−T),T≤t<T+zcT+rz,t≥T+zLetλT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)andλT=suptλT(t). According to the definition of competitive ratio, λTis the competitive ratio of online strategy A(T). We divide the value of T into three cases to discuss the lower bound.Case 1: If T < T*, thenλT(t)={1,t<TT(c−r)+rtct,T≤t<T+zcT+rzct,T+z≤t<rzc1+cTrz,t≥rzcThis is a piecewise continuous function. Whent=z+T,the ratio function λT(t) attains its greatest value by the monotonicity of each section. Therefore, the competitive ratio of online algorithm A(T) isλT(z+T)=cT+rzc(z+T). If T < T*, the smallest value of λTapproachesλT*=2−c/r,which implies that the competitive ratios of all online strategies A(T) with T < T* have a lower bound of2−c/r.Case 2: IfT*≤T<rzc,then the cost ratio of the online strategy over the offline strategy isλT(t)={1,t<TT(c−r)+rtct,T≤t<rzcT(c−r)+rtrz,rzc≤t<T+z1+cTrz,t≥T+zAccording to the monotonicity of each section of this piecewise continuous function, the above ratio attains its greatest value att=z+T,so the competitive ratio isλT=λT(z+T)=1+cTrz. If T* ≤ T < rz/ c, the least value of λTapproachesλT*=2−c/r,which implies that in the case of T* ≤ T < rz/ c), all online strategies A(T) will have a greater competitive ratio than2−c/r.Case 3: IfT≥rzc,similarly,λT(t)={1,t<rzcctrz,rzc≤t<TT(c−r)+rtrz,T≤t<T+z1+cTrz,t≥T+zThis is also a piecewise continuous function. By analyzing the monotonicity of each section, we know that λT(t) has its greatest value att=z+T,and the competitive ratio of strategy A(T) isλT=λT(z+T)=1+cTrz. IfT≥rzc,the lowest value isλT(z+rzc)=2,which implies all strategies A(T) will have a greater competitive ratio than 2 whenT≥rzc.In summary, the lower bound of the problem in the financial lease without down payment case is2−cr. □From Lemmas 1 and 2, we obtain Theorem 1 as the optimal competitive strategy result.Theorem 1For the online financial lease problem without down payment, letT*=(r/c−1)z. The strategy A(T*) is the optimal online strategy with competitive ratio(2−cr).Theorem 1 tells us that for a financial lease without down payment, if the exact length of time t the equipment will be needed is unknown, then the optimal strategy is to lease the equipment from the start to the moment(r/c−1)zand use the financial lease thereafter. This strategy can guarantee a cost of at most(2−cr)of the minimum possible cost, for any possible length of time the equipment is used.Section 3 analyzes the model for a financial lease without down payment, though there is a more realistic version of the problem in which most financial lease contracts require a down payment. For convenience, lett0=(b+rz)/crepresent the moment that the lease and financial lease are equal.First, it is apparent that the offline optimal cost is as follows (See Figs. 1and 2):(1)Ifb+rz<cz,we have,(2)Costopt(t)={ct,t<bc−rb+rt,bc−r≤t<zb+rz,t≥zIfb+rz≥cz,we have,(3)Costopt(t)={ct,t<t0b+rz,t≥t0Second, the analysis always presumes the following:Lemma 3Letg(x)=max{1+bcx,1+cxb+rz}on a feasible set [ a1, a2) (a1, a2may be infinity), and letx*=b(b+rz)c. Then, if x* ∈ [ a1, a2),minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=1+bb+rz; if x* < a1,minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=1+ca1b+rz; if x* ≥ a2,minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=1+bca2.It is clear that the inner function1+bcxis a decreasing function of x, while the inner function1+cxb+rzis an increasing function. To find the minimum value of g(x), let1+bcx=1+cxb+rzto obtainx*=b(b+rz)c. Thus, if x* ∈ [ a1, a2),minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=g(x*)=1+bb+rz. By monotonicity, we know that if x* < a1,minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=1+ca1b+rz; and if x* ≥ a2,minx∈[a1,a2)g(x)=1+bca2. This proves Lemma 3. □Now, for any fixed T, the cost of online strategy A(T) is described in Eq. (4):(4)CostA(T)(t)={ct,t<TcT+b+r(t−T),T≤t<T+zcT+b+rz,t≥T+zWe first analyze the caseb<(c−r)zand then discuss the caseb≥(c−r)z. Note that the caseb<(c−r)zimplies c > r,bc−r<z,and(c−r)2z2c−r<(c−r)z.Theorem 2Ifb<(c−r)z,then(1)when(c−r)2z2c−r<b<(c−r)z,the online strategy A(T) withT=b(b+rz)cis the optimal strategy with competitive ratio1+bb+rz;whenb≤(c−r)2z2c−r,the online strategy A(T) withT=bc−ris the optimal strategy with competitive ratio2−rc.By (2) and (4), letλT=suptλT(t)=suptCostA(T)(t)Costopt(t). There are three cases.Case 1.0≤T<bc−r. In this case, byT<bc−r<z<T+z,λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<TcT+b+r(t−T)ct,T≤t<bc−rcT+b+r(t−T)b+rt,bc−r≤t<zcT+b+r(t−T)b+rz,z≤t<T+zcT+b+rzb+rz,t≥T+zFor fixed T, this piecewise function represents the constants on t in both the first and the last intervals, λT(t) are decreasing functions of t in both the second and the third intervals, while this function in the fourth interval is an increasing function of t, thus by the continuous property of this function, the maximal value of λT(t), i.e., the competitive ratio of A(T), isλT=max{1,λT(T),λT(T+z)}=max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz}.Case 2.bc−r≤T<z. Bybc−r≤T<z<T+z,we have:λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<bc−rctb+rt,bc−r≤t<TcT+b+r(t−T)b+rt,T≤t<zcT+b+r(t−T)b+rz,z≤t<T+zcT+b+rzb+rz,t≥T+zSimilarly, the piecewise function λT(t) in both the first and last intervals are constants of t, and in both the second and fourth intervals are increasing functions of t, while in the third interval is a decreasing function of t, thus by the continuous property, the maximal value of λT(t) isλT=max{b+cTb+rT,cT+b+rzb+rz}.Case 3.T ≥ z;bc−r<z<T<T+z,and thus:λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<bc−rctb+rt,bc−r≤t<zctb+rz,z≤t<TcT+b+r(t−T)b+rz,T≤t<T+zcT+b+rzb+rz,t≥T+zSimilarly, in the first and last intervals, the piecewise function is the constant of t, and in all other intervals, λT(t) are increasing functions of t. Thus, by the continuous property, the maximum value of λT(t) isλT=λT(T+z)=1+cTb+rz.In summary, given T, the competitive ratio for strategy A(T) is(5)λT={max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},0≤T<bc−rmax{b+cTb+rT,1+cTb+rz},bc−r≤T<z1+cTb+rz,T≥zTo determine the optimal competitive strategy, we must compute the minimum value of λT. In the first interval0≤T<bc−rof (5), by Lemma 3, if0≤b(b+rz)c<bc−r,which is equivalent tob>(c−r)2z2c−r,the minimum value in this interval is1+bb+rz,while ifb(b+rz)c≥bc−r,which is equivalent tob≤(c−r)2z2c−r,the minimum value in this interval is1+bcbc−r=2−rc.In the second intervalbc−r≤T<zof (5), both inner functions are increasing functions of T. Thus, their minimal solutions must be the same (left) pointbc−r,and the minimum value in this interval ismax{b+cbc−rb+rbc−r,1+cbc−rb+rz}=max{2−rc,1+bc(b+rz)(c−r)}. That is, if2−rc<1+bc(b+rz)(c−r),which is equivalently tob>(c−r)2z2c−r,the minimum value is1+bc(b+rz)(c−r),while if2−rc≥1+bc(b+rz)(c−r),which is equivalently tob≤(c−r)2z2c−r,the minimum value is2−rc.In the last interval T ≥ z of (5), the function1+cTb+rzis an increasing function, so the minimum value in this interval is1+czb+rz.Above all, we have obtained the minimum value in each interval for (5). Thus, the global minimum value for λT, denoted by λopt, is:(1)if(c−r)2z2c−r<b<(c−r)z,thenλopt=min{1+bb+rz,1+bc(b+rz)(c−r),1+czb+rz}It is easy to confirm this using the conditions(c−r)2z2c−r<b<(c−r)z,1+bb+rz<1+bc(b+rz)(c−r)<1+czb+rz. Thus,λopt=1+bb+rzand the optimal competitive strategy A(T) is to takeT=b(b+rz)c.ifb≤z(c−r)22c−r,thenλopt=min{2−rc,2−rc,1+czb+rz}Note that byb≤z(c−r)22c−r,we haveczb+rz≥czz(c−r)22c−r+rz=2−rc,thusλopt=2−rcand the optimal competitive strategy A(T) is to takeT=bc−r.This completes the proof of Theorem 2. □Theorem 2 tells us the optimal competitive strategies for a financial lease with down payment0<b<(c−r)z. In the following, we analyze the case whenb≥(c−r)z. First, we have the following closed-form competitive ratio for strategy A(T).Lemma 4Ifb+rz≥cz,then the competitive ratio for strategy A(T) is:λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t0max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},t0−z<T≤t0andb+(c−r)T≥01+cTb+rz,t0−z<T≤t0andb+(c−r)T<01+bcT,T≤t0−zandb+(c−r)T≥0cT+b+rzc(T+z),T≤t0−zandb+(c−r)T<0There are three cases in which to discussλT=suptλT(t)=suptCostA(T)(t)Costopt(t).Case 1.t0<T<T+z. The cost ratio of the online strategy A(T) to the offline optimal strategy is:λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<t0ctb+rz,t0≤t<TcT+b+r(t−T)b+rz,T≤t<T+zcT+b+rzb+rz,t≥T+zFor a fixed T, the piecewise functions in both the first and last intervals are constant, and in both the second and third intervals are increasing functions; thus, the maximal value of λT(t), i.e., the competitive ratio of A(T) in this case, isλT=cT+b+rzb+rz=1+cTb+rz.Case 2.T≤t0<T+z,ort0−z<T≤t0. Now the cost ratio of the online strategy A(T) to the offline optimal strategy is:λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<TcT+b+r(t−T)ct,T≤t<t0cT+b+r(t−T)b+rz,t0≤t<T+zcT+b+rzb+rz,t≥T+zIn both the first and last intervals, these piecewise functions are constants, and in the third interval, the function is an increasing function, while in the second interval, note thatcT+b+r(t−T)ct=b+(c−r)Tct+rc,the monotonicity of λT(t) depends on the sign ofb+(c−r)T. Ifb+(c−r)T≥0,the function in the second interval is a decreasing function, thus λT(t) has a maximal value att=Tort=T+z,and the competitive ratio ismax{λT(T),λT(T+z)}=max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz}. However, ifb+(c−r)T<0,the function in the second interval is an increasing function, and λT(t) has a maximal value att=T+z,with competitive ratio factorλT(T+z)=1+cTb+rz. Hence, the competitive ratio of A(T) in this case isλT=max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz}ifb+(c−r)T≥0andλT=1+cTb+rzifb+(c−r)T<0.Case 3.T<T+z≤t0. Now, the cost ratio of the online strategy A(T) to the offline optimal strategy is:λT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)={1,t<TcT+b+r(t−T)ct,T≤t<T+zcT+b+rzct,T+z≤t<t0cT+b+rzb+rz,t≥t0Similarly, in the first and last intervals, these piecewise functions are constants, and in the third interval, the function is a decreasing function, while in the second interval, similar to the discussion of Case 2, this piecewise function is a decreasing function ifb+(c−r)T≥0and is an increasing function ifb+(c−r)T<0. Thus, by the continuous property of λT(t), ifb+(c−r)T≥0,λT(t) arrives its maximal value att=Tand ifb+(c−r)T<0,and λT(t) arrives its maximal value att=T+z. That is,λT=1+bcTifb+(c−r)T≥0andλT=cT+b+rzc(T+z)ifb+(c−r)T<0. These cases together conclude the proof of Lemma 4. □To determine the optimal competitive strategy, we must analyze the minimum value of λTin Lemma 4, which depends on c and r. We analyze c ≥ r and present Theorem 3.Theorem 3Ifb≥(c−r)zand c ≥ r, then the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c,and its competitive ratio is1+bb+rz.If c ≥ r,b+(c−r)T>0always holds. Thus by Lemma 4, given T andb≥(c−r)z,the competitive ratio for strategy A(T) can be simplified by:λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t0max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},t0−z<T≤t01+bcT,T≤t0−zIn the first interval T > t0, the minimal value is1+ct0b+rz=2when T approaches t0, and in the third intervalT≤t0−z,the minimal value is1+bc(t0−z)=1+bb+rz−cz. In the second interval, note that byb≥(c−r)z>(c−r)2z2c−r,we haveb(b+rz)c>b+rz−czc=t0−z,andb(b+rz)c≤b+rzc=t0always holds, thus by Lemma 3, the minimum value in the second interval is1+bb+rz.Thus, the global minimum competitive ratio is:min{2,1+bb+rz,1+bb+rz−cz}Note that if c > r, and then byb≥(c−r)z>(c−r)2z2c−r,we havebb+rz≤bb+rz−cz,and the above value is1+bb+rz,the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c.This completes the proof of Theorem 3. □We now analyze the case whereb+rz≥czand c < r. In this case, the condition c < r autonomous guarantees the conditionb+rz≥cz. To simplify the following analysis, we highlight a simple algebraic fact here in Lemma 5.Lemma 5If c < r, thenb(2c−r)<(c−r)2zis equivalent tobr−c<b(b+rz)c<t0−z.If c < r, the identical relationship can be easily verified:br−c<b(b+rz)c⟺cr−c<1+rzb⟺rzb>c2−(r−c)2(r−c)2=r(2c−r)(r−c)2⟺b(2c−r)<(r−c)2z. Additionally,b(b+rz)c<t0−z=b+rz−czc⟺b(b+rz)<(b+rz−cz)2⟺b(2c−r)<(r−c)2z. □If c < r, then(1)whenb(2c−r)≤(c−r)2z,the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=t0−z=b+rz−czc,and its competitive ratio is2−czb+rz;whenb(2c−r)>(c−r)2z,the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c,and its competitive ratio is1+bb+rz.If c < r, thenb+rz>czis satisfied. Note that for T ≥ 0,b+(c−r)T≥0is equivalent toT≤br−c. This combined with Lemma 4 indicates that for any given T, the competitive ratio of A(T) is:(6)λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t0max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},t0−z<T≤t0andT≤br−c1+cTb+rz,t0−z<T≤t0andT>br−c1+bcT,T≤t0−zandT≤br−ccT+b+rzc(T+z),T≤t0−zandT>br−cWe now discuss the piecewise function λTby analyzing the casebr−c,t0 andt0−z.Case 1. Ifbr−c≤t0−z,then it is equivalent tob(2c−r)≤(c−r)2zby Lemma 5.In this case, the second interval in the piecewise function of (6) is omitted, the third interval is simplified ast0−z<T≤t0,the fourth interval is simplified asT≤br−c,and the last interval isbr−c<T≤t0−z. Thus, λTis:λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t01+cTb+rz,t0−z<T≤t01+bcT,T≤br−ccT+b+rzc(T+z),br−c<T≤t0−zFor this new simplified formulation, in the first interval T > t0, the minimal value is1+ct0b+rz=2; in the second intervalt0−z<T≤t0,the minimal value is1+c(t0−z)b+rz=2−czb+rz; in the third intervalT≤br−c,the minimal value is1+bc(br−c)=rc; in the last intervalbr−c<T≤t0−z,the functioncT+b+rzc(T+z)=1+b+rz−czcT+czis a decreasing function of T, and the minimal value is1+b+rz−czc(t0−z)+cz=2−czb+rz. Thus, the global minimum value ismin{2,2−czb+rz,rc,2−czb+rz},note that2−czb+rz≤rcbyb(2c−r)≤(c−r)2z. Therefore, in this case, the optimal competitive ratio is2−czb+rz,and the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=t0−z=b+rz−czc.Case 2. Ift0−z<br−c≤t0,it is equivalent to(c−r)2z<b(2c−r)<r(r−c)zby Lemma 5 and simple algebra.Here, in the piecewise function of (6), the second interval ist0−z<T≤br−c,the third interval is simplified tobr−c<T≤t0,the fourth interval is simplified toT≤t0−z,and the last interval is omitted. Thus, λTis:λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t0max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},t0−z<T≤br−c1+cTb+rz,br−c<T≤t01+bcT,T≤t0−zIn this simplified formulation, in the first interval T > t0, the minimal value is1+ct0b+rz=2; in the second intervalt0−z<T≤br−c,byb(2c−r)>(c−r)2zand Lemma 5, we havet0−z<b(b+rz)c≤br−c; thus, by Lemma 3, the minimal value is1+bb+rz. In the third intervalbr−c<T≤t0,the minimal value is1+c(br−c)b+rz=1+bc(b+rz)(r−c); and in the last intervalT≤t0−z,the minimal value is1+bc(t0−z)=1+bb+rz−cz. Thus, the global minimum value ismin{2,1+bb+rz,1+bc(b+rz)(r−c),1+bb+rz−cz}. Note thatbc(b+rz)(r−c)>bb+rz−cz>bb+rzbyb(2c−r)>(c−r)2z,so in this case, the optimal competitive ratio is1+bb+rzwith optimal strategy A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c.Case 3.br−c>t0>t0−z,which is equivalent tob(2c−r)>r(r−c)zby Lemma 5. We will prove that both the optimal competitive strategy and competitive ratio are the same as in Case 2.In case 3, in the piecewise function of (6), the second interval ist0−z<T≤t0<br−c,both third and last intervals are omitted, the fourth interval is simplified toT≤t0−z,that is, λTis:λT={1+cTb+rz,T>t0max{1+bcT,1+cTb+rz},t0−z<T≤t01+bcT,T≤t0−zIn this new formulation, in the first interval T > t0, the minimal value is1+ct0b+rz=2. In the second intervalt0−z<T≤t0,byb(2c−r)>(c−r)2zand by Lemma 5,t0−z≤b(b+rz)c<t0always holds, thus, by Lemma 3, the minimal value is1+bb+rz. In the third intervalT≤t0−z,the minimal value is1+bc(t0−z)=1+bb+rz−cz. Thus, the global minimum value ismin{2,1+bb+rz,1+bb+rz−cz}. Note thatbb+rz−cz>bb+rzbyb(2c−r)>r(r−c)z,thus, in this case, the optimal competitive strategy is A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c,and the optimal competitive ratio is1+bb+rz.This completes the proof of Theorem 4. □Note that case 1 in Theorem 4 reduces to Theorem 1 whenb=0.We have obtained the optimal online strategy and competitive ratio for all cases from Theorems 1–4, which can be summarized in Table 2.To give a simpler decision rule for the optimal online strategy in different cases, we need to discuss the constraints further, as summarized in Theorem 5.Theorem 5Letπ=czb+rz. The optimal online strategy A(T) with its competitive ratio for the online financial lease problem is(1)Whenrc≥2,thenT=b+rz−czc,and the competitive ratio is2−czb+rz;Whenrc<2and0<π≤2−rc,thenT=b(b+rz)c,and the competitive ratio is1+bb+rz;When0<rc<1andπ>2−rc,thenT=bc−r,and the competitive ratio is2−rc;When1<rc<2andπ>2−rc,thenT=b+rz−czc,the competitive ratio is2−czb+rz.In Table 2, there are three optional strategies: A(T) withT=b(b+rz)c,bc−r,andb+rz−czc. First, for optimal strategyT=b+rz−czc,the constraints areb>(c−r)z,c < r, andb(2c−r)≤(c−r)2z. b ≥ 0 and c < r impliesb>(c−r)z,conditions equivalent to (i) c < r and 2 c ≤ r or (ii) 2 c > r,b≤(c−r)2z2c−r,and c < r. A crucial note here is thatb≤(c−r)2z2c−ris equivalent toczb+rz≥2−rc. This leads toπ=czb+rz,and thus, the constraints to ensure the optimal strategy A(T) withT=b(b+rz)care (i)rc≥2or (ii)1<rc<2andπ≥2−rc.To ensure that the optimal strategy A(T) takesT=bc−r,the conditions areb≤(c−r)2z2c−randb<(c−r)z. Note that b ≥ 0 implies c > r, so the constraints of this case arerc<1andb≤min{(c−r)2z2c−r,(c−r)z}=(c−r)2z2c−r. Thus, we find that the optimal strategy A(T) will takeT=bc−rif the constraints arerc<1andπ≥2−rc.Finally, the conditions for the optimal strategy A(T) takesT=b(b+rz)care either (i)b<(c−r)zandb>(c−r)2z2c−r,(ii)b≥(c−r)zand c ≥ r, or (iii)b≥(c−r)z,c < r andb(2c−r)>(c−r)2z. Note that the constraintsb≥(c−r)zand c ≥ r implyb(2c−r)>(c−r)2z,so the constraint for this optimal strategy in all cases isb(2c−r)>(c−r)2z,which can be simplified torc≤2and0<π≤2−rc.Theorem 5 thus summarizes the simple decision. □We call the indexπ=czb+rzthe rent-to-value index, which presents the ratios of the lease cost and financial lease cost. In addition, the decision rules in Theorem 5 can be illustrated as in Fig. 3, with three areas in the first quadrant denoting various corresponding optimal strategies.This section performs the numerical analysis to validate our theoretical results. We take the example used in Section 1: consider someone with two options to use a repertory: lease with rental cost of $2000 per month, or use a financial lease with a cost of $ 3000 per month, with the ownership transferring to the lessee after 24 months. Here,c=2000,r=3000,andz=24.We consider a financial lease without down payment, (b=0). In Table 3, we present the numerical results forT=10,11,…,14. For each T, assume the length of time the equipment will be used ist=30,31,…,40,we compute the optimal offline cost and the cost of strategy A(T). From Table 3, we see that, given T, the cost of the offline strategy and A(T) are non-decreasing functions with t. However, they increase at different rates. In Fig. 4we illustrate the ratio functionsλT(t)=CostA(T)(t)Costopt(t)for t ≥ 0. According to the competitive ratio definition, given T,λT=maxtλT(t)is the competitive ratio for the online strategy A(T). Fig. 4 shows that the optimal strategy is the one with the minimal maximum value 1.333, that is, A(T) withT=12. Thus, we see in our example of a financial lease without down payment, the optimal online strategy A(T) isT=12with competitive ratio 1.333. It is easy to verify that this solution is consistent with Theorem 1, as well as the generality formulation of Theorems 4.1 and 5.We next consider the case of a financial lease with down payment. Assume b = $10000. Table 4 presents the numerical results, and Fig. 5 illustrates the ratio functions λT(t) for t ≥ 0. As in the previous discussion, the results show that the optimal strategy is the one with the minimal competitive ratio 1.415, that is, the optimal online strategy A(T) withT=17. This solution is also consistent with Theorems 4.2 and 5.
