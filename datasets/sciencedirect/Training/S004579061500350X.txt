@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data hiding in digital multimedia, such as text, image, audio, and video, plays an increasingly vital role in the current trend of secure communication [1]. Secure communication is highly desirable in many cases and has thus given rise to the need to develop new approaches in information hiding [2]. Steganography is one of the most significant techniques for secure communication. Steganography is the art of hiding data within data by concealing the presence of messages [3]. The process of data hiding in basic steganography is shown in Fig. 1. In any basic steganographic technique, the cover-medium serves as the carrier of the secret message, the secret message is the message to be embedded into the cover-medium, and the stego-medium is the medium containing the embedded data [4].Modern Internet technologies demonstrate that videos are important media for sharing data, medical records, banking information, broadcast information, and military intelligence. Videos are particularly suitable for data hiding for a number of reasons: (1) distortions in videos can be handled faultlessly, (2) hidden data are imperceptible to the human visual system (HVS), and (3) videos provide additional hiding space. The present work is undertaken in consideration of the widespread use of video data. As videos are often stored and transmitted in compressed formats, data hiding should withstand lossy compression [5]. Accordingly, many data-hiding schemes are executed in the transform domain by modifying discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients.A considerable number of steganography studies have been conducted on the spatial and transform domains of cover-media for data hiding [6]. In the spatial-domain approach, data are hidden in the pixels of a cover-medium. The least significant bit (LSB)-based data-hiding technique is the most widely used spatial-domain-based steganography. In [7], the data were embedded into a compressed video in the transform domain, which is highly vulnerable to steganalysis. The payload was minimal; nevertheless, the method achieved low-video distortion.In [8], the distortion levels were reduced by employing a method with a dual-convolution code that minimizes the additive distortion in steganography. In recent years, many data-hiding schemes have been developed in the transform domain, in which the data are embedded into the transform coefficients of the cover-medium using polynomial mathematics [9], Fourier transform, DCT, and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Transform-domain methods are generally more robust than spatial-domain methods [10].The present work attempts to improve secret-data security by utilizing DCT and DWT coefficients. The key objectives of this study are as follows:•To enhance the security of hidden data by using scene-change detection and the DCT coefficients of video sequencesTo improve video quality after hiding data using DWT in video sequencesThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the methods that are currently used in data hiding, including their advantages and limitations. Section 3 explains the proposed scene-change-detection-based data hiding (SCDH) method for video steganography in the DCT and DWT domains. Section 4 presents the analysis and comparison of the experimental results obtained using the proposed SCDH method, and other existing methods. Section 5 concludes the paper.HVS - human visual systems; MR-FMO - multivariate regression and flexible macro-block ordering; MPEG - moving picture experts group; LSB - least significant bit; DWT - discrete wavelet transform; DCT - discrete cosine transform; UCI - University of California Irvine; SCDH – scene-change-based data hiding technique; DWTSQ - DWT-based steganography for quality; S-DWT - steganography using DWT; PSNR - peak signal-to-noise ratio; MSE - mean squared error; dB - decibels.
