@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The paper suggests a differential game of advertising competition among three symmetric firms, played over an infinite horizon. The objective of the research is to see if a cooperative agreement among the firms can be sustained over time. For this purpose the paper determines the characteristic functions (value functions) of individual players and all possible coalitions. We identify an imputation that belongs to the core. Using this imputation guarantees that, in any subgame starting out on the cooperative state trajectory, no coalition has an incentive to deviate from what was prescribed by the solution of the grand coalition’s optimization problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A seminal paper in the literature dealing with the design of a firm’s optimal advertising strategy is Nerlove and Arrow (1962) who argued that a firm’s advertising efforts could be seen as an investment in a particular asset, viz., a stock of advertising goodwill held by a firm11Later on, advertising goodwill has also been referred to as “advertising capital”, “brand image”, or “brand equity”.. The goodwill stock can be built up by expending money on advertising, but is subject to decay if advertising expenditures are insufficient. The Nerlove–Arrow model may be seen as a reinterpretation of the neoclassical capital accumulation model of Ramsey (1928), letting the stock of advertising goodwill play the role of a stock of physical capital.The Nerlove–Arrow model have been extended to multi-firm settings. Fershtman (1984) studied a straightforward extension of the Nerlove–Arrow model to an oligopolistic market. Subsequent research has extended the model of Nerlove and Arrow in many directions and employed it in new settings. This literature is surveyed in, e.g., Huang, Leng, and Liang (2012); Jørgensen and Zaccour (2004).A main difference between the current research and earlier studies of goodwill (or physical capital) accumulation lies in the objectives of the firms operating in the market. The literature has focused on noncooperative games played by oligopolistic firms that act individually and in their own best interest. No cooperation or sharing of information takes place. The aim of our research is to study intertemporal cooperation among oligopolists. More specifically, the paper•characterizes the advertising strategies that are prescribed for the firms when they act in a cooperative and coordinated way, with the purpose of maximizing industry profits.shows how a cooperative agreement can be sustained over time, in the sense that no single firm or coalition of firms has an incentive to deviate from its part of the agreement as the game proceeds along the trajectory that is prescribed for the grand coalition22The grand coalition is a cartel consisting of all firms in the market..Some studies in the area of noncooperative games also characterize the solution to the industry profit maximization problem and may also suggest a way to divide industry profits among the firms. In these studies, however, the cooperative solution primarily serves as a benchmark to which the essential object of research, the noncooperative outcomes, can be compared. Not much seems to have been said in the dynamic advertising game literature about intertemporal sustainability of a cooperative agreement. This question is not trivial and is the focus of this paper.To determine a cooperative outcome on which all can agree, firms negotiate before the start of the game. The intention is to act collectively by forming, and maintaining, the grand coalition. In the absence of a binding agreement (which often is illegal) on cooperation, there is no guarantee that firms will stick to the strategies prescribed by the agreement. Smaller coalitions — or single firms — may find it attractive to leave the grand coalition during the course of the game. Indeed, being rational, they will do so if they can obtain higher profits by leaving the grand coalition and acting in their own best interest. Deviations may occur at any time during the play of the game and makes the cooperative agreement potentially unstable.To avoid that coalitions or single firms defect on the grand coalition outcome, the cooperative agreement must be time consistent. An agreement is, briefly speaking, time consistent if the grand coalition’s optimal profit is distributed in such a way that no subcoalition has an incentive to leave the grand coalition at any instant of time. This is accomplished if one can find a profit allocation (also known as an imputation) that belongs to the core. An imputation is in the core if coalitional rationality is satisfied, that is, no coalition can gain by leaving the grand coalition.We should mention that our approach to establishing intertemporal cooperation, viz., by implementing a cooperative agreement which belongs to the core, is not the only way to sustain cooperation. For example, in a non-cooperative differential game of international pollution control (Dockner & Long, 1993) have shown that if players (governments) use nonlinear Markov-perfect strategies, and if the discount rate is sufficiently low, then a Pareto-optimal steady-state pollution stock can be supported as a subgame-perfect equilibrium. There are, however, many equilibria to chose among and preplay communication will be needed.Note that Dockner and Long’s result assumes that governments play a non-cooperative game. Our setup is a cooperative game which establishes the sustainability of a desired outcome in a quite different way.The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the differential game. Sections 3 and 4, respectively, identify an equilibrium in a noncooperative Nash game and an optimal solution of the grand coalition’s joint-maximization problem. Section 5 characterizes the core and Section 6 shows how one can distribute the grand coalition’s optimal profit such that the profit allocation belongs to the core. Section 7 concludes.Consider an oligopolistic market with n firms, each selling its own particular brand (product or service). Our aim is to construct a model that is simple but still allows us to make our points.We restrict our analysis to the case of a triopoly (n=3) of symmetric firms33Assuming identical firms is mainly a matter of mathematical convenience. In capital accumulation games, Reynolds (1987); 1991), for example, considered identical firms.. The extension to an arbitrary number of firms (greater than three) would be straightforward in Sections 3 and 4 where we deal with a noncooperative game and a joint optimization problem, respectively. An extension enables one to see what are the implications if the number of firms in the industry decreases or increases. This comes, however, at a cost: In the coalitional games of Sections 5 and 6, the number of possible coalitions would increase and the notation be more complicated. Thus, readability would suffer.Time t is continuous and the planning horizon of firms is infinite;t∈[0,∞). Let ai(t) ≥ 0 be the rate of advertising effort (e.g., seconds of television advertising, millimeters of newspaper or magazine advertisement) of firm i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Advertising efforts affect present and future sales and hence revenues. To represent the intertemporal effects of advertising one can define a nonnegative stock, henceforth denoted Gi(t). This stock of ‘advertising goodwill’ is supposed to summarize past and present effects of advertising. In our model, goodwill stocks will act as state variables while advertising efforts are control variables that affect the evolution of goodwill stocks. State and control variables also affect the profits of firms.Suppose that the stock of advertising goodwill of firm i evolves according to the differential equation(1)G˙i(t)=κai(t);Gi(0)≜g0>0;i∈{1,2,3}in which the constant κ > 0 reflects the efficiency of advertising effort of a firm. Due to symmetry, advertising efforts of all firms are equally efficient and without loss of generality we can setκ=1. Since advertising effort cannot be negative, the dynamics in (1) imply that goodwill cannot be decreased. The strategic implication of this is that once a firm has accumulated goodwill up to a certain level, it is locked in. The firm’s only options are to stay at this level (by not advertising) or advertise to further increase its stock of goodwill.We shall make an assumption which (i) enables us to restrict our attention to strategies for which value functions are continuously differentiable and (ii) makes it unnecessary to explore the full state space of the system:A1.The initial values of advertising goodwill stock satisfy g0 < β/6.The dynamics in (1) are a special case of the Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model(2)G˙i(t)=κai(t)−δGi(t)when there is no depreciation of goodwill (δ=0). Goodwill depreciation can be seen as reflecting the argument that a dollar spent on advertising some time ago should contribute less than a dollar spent today. The depreciation parameter δ also has an interpretation as a measure of the carry-over effect of advertising: The smaller δ, the larger the carry-over effect.The model in (1) can be interpreted as one in which an advertising dollar spent today has the same effect as a dollar spent earlier or advertising has maximal carry-over effect. In any case, the dynamics in (1) can be seen as an approximation to a market where goodwill decays rather slowly. It has been chosen, with a view to the rather complicated calculations needed in coalitional games in Sections 5 and 6, to employ the simpler dynamics in (1). We are quite confident that the results in Sections 5 to 6, which are the main contribution of the paper, will not change, qualitatively speaking, if depreciation were introduced.Dynamics with no depreciation have occasionally been employed in literature on capital accumulation. If in this type of model one assumes that disinvestment is impossible, it follows that investment is irreversible. This is an interesting topic which has been studied in, e.g., Dockner, Jørgensen, Long, and Sorger (2000); Fudenberg and Tirole (1992); Long (2010).Remark 1The Nerlove–Arrow dynamics assume that the evolution of a firm’s advertising goodwill depends on its own effort only. This reflects a hypothesis that competitors’ advertising has no — or only negligible — impact on the goodwill level of a firm. Depending on, e.g., market characteristics and consumer behavior, the assumption may or may not apply. The obvious modification is to include competitors’ advertising efforts, aj(t), j ≠ i, on the right-hand side of (1), affecting negatively the goodwill stock of firm i. This was done in, e.g., Nair and Narasimhan (2006); Viscolani and Zaccour (2009).LetN={1,2,3}be the set of players. The sales (or demand) rate of firm i at time t is si(t) and depends on the stocks of advertising goodwill:(3)si(t)=fi(G(t)),i∈Nwhere G(t)≜(G1(t), G2(t), G3(t)). Note that although advertising of a firm does not affect directly the goodwill of its rivals, advertising of a firm affects its own goodwill (cf. (1)) and therefore, through (3), the competitors’ sales.We follow (Reynolds, 1991) and specify function fias(4)fi(G)=[β−∑h=13Gh]Gi,i∈Nwhere β > 0 is a parameter. For sales to remain nonnegative we impose the path constraints(5)∑j=13Gj(t)≤βatanyt>0.Function fihas the following properties:∂fi∂Gi=β−2Gi−Gj−Gk∂2fi∂Gi2=−2∂fi∂Gk=−Gi,k≠i∂2fi∂Gi∂Gk=−1,k≠i.These partial derivatives show the following. Sales of a firm should increase when its goodwill increases. To satisfy this requirement it must hold that(6)β−2Gi−Gj−Gk>0forallt.The derivative in the second line states that the sales function is concave in Gi, given Gjand Gk. This implies that it is suboptimal to have Gi→ ∞. Negativity of the third derivative means that the sales rate of firm i decreases if the goodwill stock of firm k ≠ i increases. Thus, if brand k becomes more popular among consumers, sales of brand i decreases. Finally, the fourth derivative says that the marginal ‘productivity’ of Gidecreases if Gkincreases. Thus, the two stocks are strategic substitutes (see, e.g., Fudenberg & Tirole, 1992).Let π be the constant margin (i.e., profit per unit of sales) of firm i. The cost of advertising effort aiof firm i is supposed to be quadratic, reflecting increasing marginal costs of advertising44The Nerlove–Arrow model with a convex advertising cost function was analyzed by Gould (1970).:C(ai)=c2ai2,i∈Nin which c > 0 is a parameter. Let ρ > 0 denote a discounting rate employed by all firms. The payoff functional, to be maximized, of firm i is(7)Ji(ai)=∫0∞e−ρt(π[β−∑h=13Gh(t)]Gi(t)−c2ai2(t))dt.Control and state constraints to be satisfied by firm i for allt∈[0,∞)are as follows:(8)ai(t)≥0Gi(t)≥0β>2Gi(t)+Gj(t)+Gk(t).Note that the inequality in the third line impliesGi(t)+Gj(t)+Gk(t)<β. This means that when sales fiincrease as goodwill Giincreases, sales are positive.The games considered in this paper are autonomous, i.e., all parameters are time-independent. Moreover, the planning horizon is infinite. In such problems, a standard approach in the literature is to look for stationary solutions/equilibria. This means that advertising strategies and value functions do not depend explicitly on time55A value function represents the optimal profit-to-go that can be obtained by a firm, or a coalition, as of a certain instant of time..If no agreement on cooperation can be reached at time zero, a noncooperative game is played fort∈[0,∞).We shall determine a Nash equilibrium. Let Vi(G) be a continuously differentiable value function of firm i. This function must solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation:(9)ρVi(G)=maxai≥0{π[β−∑j=13Gj]Gi−c2ai2+∂Vi∂Giai}.Performing the maximization on the right-hand side yields the equilibrium advertising strategiesai(G)={1c∂Vi∂Gi>0if∂Vi∂Gi>00if∂Vi∂Gi≤0.Inserting these rates into (9) provides(10)Vi(G)=12ρc(∂Vi∂Gi)2+πρ[β−∑j=13Gj]Giifai>0Vi(G)=πρ[β−∑j=13Gj]Giifai=0.Since firms are identical, they will use the same type of strategy.Using (10) shows thatVi(G)∣ai>0−Vi(G)∣ai=0=12ρc(∂Vi∂Gi)2>0which shows that for any firm i the strategy ai> 0 payoff-dominates the strategyai=0.Therefore the firm will use positive advertising throughout the game.We guess that the first equation in (10) has the solution(11)Vi(G)=α+γAGi+ϵA2Gi2+(ηAGi+γB)(Gj+Gk)+ϵB2(Gj2+Gk2)+ηBGjGkin which α, γA, γB, ϵA, ϵB, ηA, ηBare constants to be determined and such that ϵAis negative. We shall see that the latter is true and has the implication that the goodwill trajectory Gi(t) converges to β/4 for t → ∞.The value function in (11) has the partial derivatives∂Vi∂Gi=γA+ϵAGi+ηA(Gj+Gk)and inserting these on the right-hand side of the first equation in (10), and using (11) on the left-hand side, shows that the following algebraic equations must be satisfied by the value function parameters:α=γA22cρcργA=γAϵA+cπβ,cργB=γAηAcρϵA=ϵA2−2πc,cρϵB=ηA2cρηA=ϵAηA−πc,cρηB=ηA2.These equations admit a unique solution(12)γA=β(c2ρ2+8cπ−cρ)4>0;γB=−β(cρ−c2ρ2+8cπ)216cρ<0ϵA=cρ−c2ρ2+8cπ2<0;ϵB=ηB=(cρ−c2ρ2+8cπ)216cρ>0ηA=cρ−c2ρ2+8cπ4<0.The above solution is feasible in the following sense. If the profit margin π is zero, the value function should be zero because the firm has no revenue and does not advertise. It is readily seen that the solution passes this test (which can be found in Bass, Krishamoorthy, Prasad, & Sethi, 2005).Knowing thatϵB=ηB,the value function can be rewritten asVi(G)=α+γAGi+ϵA2Gi2+(ηAGi+γB)(Gj+Gk)+ϵB2(Gj+Gk)2.Using (12) yieldsγA=−βηAandϵA=2ηAand the value function has the partial derivative∂Vi∂Gi=γA+ϵAGi+ηA(Gj+Gk)=ηA(2Gi+Gj+Gk−β)which is positive because ηAis negative and2Gi+Gj+Gk<βis a state constraint.It remains to determine the equilibrium state trajectories. From (1) we haveG˙i(t)=ai(t);Gi(0)=g0∈[0,β/6).The equilibrium advertising strategy isai(G)=c−1∂Vi/∂Giwhere∂Vi∂Gi=ηA(2Gi+Gj+Gk−β)>0and thereforeai(t)=ηAc(2Gi(t)+Gj(t)+Gk(t)−β).Substituting these rates into the dynamics yields a system of linear, inhomogeneous differential equations:(13)G˙i(t)=2ηAcGi(t)+ηAc(Gj(t)+Gk(t))−βηAc;Gi(0)=g0∈[0,β/6)Recalling that ηAis negative and using g0 < β/6 shows thatG˙i(t0)is positive. Solving (13) yieldsGi(t)=exp{4ηAct}(g0−β4)+β4which shows that the goodwill stock of firm i converges to β/4 for t → ∞. Thus, the overall goodwill stock converges to 3β/4.The conclusion is that, in the long run, competition leads to “over-accumulation” of goodwill, and hence over-spending on advertising. This result was expected and has been noted in related models of accumulation.The following proposition summarizes our results for the noncooperative game.Proposition 2If g0 < β/6 and goodwill stocks satisfy the inequality2Gi+Gj+Gk<β,the equilibrium advertising policy is, in feedback form,ai(G)=ηAc(2Gi(t)+Gj(t)+Gk(t)−β),and the goodwill trajectories areGi(t)=exp{4ηAct}(g0−β4)+β4.The open-loop representation of the optimal advertising policy isai(t)=exp{4ηAct}ηA(4g0−β)c>0.In this game, firms negotiate before the start of the game with the purpose of forming the grand coalition. Negotiations concern the choice of the firms’ individual strategies as well as a rule that determines how the joint profit earned by the grand coalition will be shared among the firms. If they cannot agree, we assume that the noncooperative game in Section 3 is played, without any possibility of renegotiation. If in the course of the game a coalition deviates from the agreement made at the start of the game, we assume (following Kranich, Perea, & Peters, 2005) that there is no option of renegotiation and some noncooperative game is played after the defection has happened. For this game we adopt a classical assumption (Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944) and suppose that it is a zero-sum game, played by a defecting coalition and the left-out firm(s).Remark 3Other assumptions exist for the choice of the type of game that is played upon a defection. For instance, the defector(s) and the left-out firm(s) play a nonzero-sum game such that the coalition (as a single player) plays its best response to the best responses of the left-out firm(s). An alternative assumption is that left-out firms fall back to their noncooperative equilibrium strategies (Petrosjan and Zaccour, 2003). The idea here is that if the grand coalition is not formed, left-out firms do not care whether or not a smaller coalition is formed.Adopting the zero-sum assumption implies that the value of a coalition is well-defined, being the maximin value in the game between a coalition and its anti-coalition. Thus, the value of a coalition is what it can obtain after a defection, whatever the anti-coalition might do. If the game is not zero-sum, the value of a coalition may not be uniquely defined.In the grand coalition, firms act collectively as one decision maker. The objective function of the coalition is the sum of the individual profits given by (7), that is,(14)J(a1,a2,a3)=∫0∞e−ρt∑i=13(π[β−∑j=13Gj(t)]Gi(t)−c2ai2(t))dt.The grand coalition solves an optimal control problem with objective (14), subject to the dynamicsG˙i(t)=ai(t),g0∈(0,β/6)as well as the state and control constraints stated in Section 3.Let the value function V(G) of the grand coalition be continuously differentiable. This function must solve the HJB equation(15)ρV(G)=maxa1,a2,a3≥0{π∑i=13[β−∑j=13Gj]Gi−c2∑i=13ai2+∑j=13∂V∂Gjaj}.Performing the maximization indicated in (15) yields optimal advertising rates given byai={1c∂V(G)∂Giif∂V(G)∂Gi>00if∂V(G)∂Gi≤0.Inserting the optimal advertising rates on the right-hand side of (15) yields(16)V(G)=πρ∑i=13[β−∑j=13Gj]Gi+12ρc∑i=13(∂V∂Gi)2ifai>0V(G)=πρ∑i=13[β−∑j=13Gj]Giifai=0.from which it follows, as in the noncooperative game, that it is optimal advertise for all t.We guess that the value function which solves the HJB equation in the first line in (16) is(17)V(G)=α+γ∑i=13Gi+η2(∑i=13Gi)2=α+γY+η2Y2in whichY≜∑i=13Giis the goodwill stock of the grand coalition and α, γ, η are constants to be determined.The value function in (17) solves the HJB equation if and only if parameters α, γ, η satisfy the algebraic equations(18)α=32cργ2ργ=πβ+3cγηρη=3cη2−2π.The unique feasible solution of equations two and three is(19)γ=β(−cρ+c2ρ2+24πc)12>0;η=cρ−c2ρ2+24πc6<0whereγ/η=−β/2.Since η is negative, function V(G) is concave in Y, that is, goodwill accumulation is subject to diminishing returns. The solution is feasible in the sense that if the profit margin π is zero, thenγ=η=α=0.Hence V(G) is zero.Using (17) provides the optimal advertising strategy of firm i:(20)ai(Y)=γ+ηYc>0ifY∈[0,β/2).Note that an individual advertising strategy aidepends on the total stock of goodwill. The intuition of optimal strategies is that as long as the total goodwill stock at time t is “low” (Y(t) < β/2), the coalition should advertise. Below we prove that Y(t) < β/2 for all t.The goodwill stock Y(t) evolves according to the differential equationY˙(t)=∑i=13G˙i(t)=3γc+3ηcY(t);Y(0)=3g0which has the solution(21)Y(t)=β2+(3g0−β2)exp{3ηct}.This expression shows that Y(t) stock converges to β/2 as time goes to infinity. Due to symmetry, the goodwill level of firm i isGi(t)=Y(t)/3.Similar to the noncooperative game, we summarize the obtained results in a proposition.Proposition 4If g0 < β/6, the optimal advertising rates are, in feedback form,ai(Y)=γ+ηYc>0,the goodwill stock Y(t) evolves according toY(t)=β2+(3g0−β2)exp{3ηct}and the open-loop representation of the optimal advertising policy of firm i isai(t)=ηc(3g0−β2)exp{3ηct}>0.To make the notation more transparent we denote from now the initial time by t0 (with the understanding that t0 is zero). If the firms agree to form the grand coalition, they determine the optimal advertising strategies, the optimal profit of the coalition, and the optimal state trajectory. The latter is given by (21) and henceforth denoted GC( · )66To make the notation more transparent we denote the initial time by t0, with the understanding that t0 is zero.. If no agreement can be reached, firms play the noncooperative game.Suppose that time is t and the grand coalition has existed from time t0 to t. The current state then is GC(t) and the following possibilities exist:•All members of the coalition continue to employ their cooperative strategies from time t. This happens if no coalition (including singletons) has an incentive to deviate at time t from the agreement.A coalition decides to deviate at time t. Deviation means that the coalition chooses a strategy which differs from the one prescribed for the coalition as member(s) of the grand coalition. Coalition members act as one decision maker. It is clear that a coalition deviates only if its profit stands to increase, compared to what coalition members would be paid as members of the grand coalition.Any coalition is free to deviate. We shall assume that after a defection, cooperation cannot be restored (cf. Kranich et al., 2005)77Allowing for renegotiations would radically change the model and give rise to a new game to be studied.. Following a defection, those firms that did not defect form an anti-coalition. This coalition plays a noncooperative game with the deviating coalition. In this two-player game we adopt, as already said, the classical assumption that it is a zero-sumgame (see, e.g., Owen, 1995). The payoff of a deviating coalition that we denote S, is the sum of the individual payoffs of the firms belonging to S. The payoff of the anti-coalition N\S is the negative of the payoff of S.In a cooperative dynamic game setting, the issue of time consistency of a cooperative agreement is essential. Time consistency means that the cooperative agreement made at time zero is not compromised at any instant of time during the course of the game as the state evolves along the trajectory GC(·). Thus, at any point on GC(·), no coalition wishes to deviate from what is prescribed for the members of the grand coalition. To ensure time consistency, the grand coalition must distribute its profits in a way such that no coalition has an incentive to deviate at any t.Denote by Γ(GC(t), t) a cooperative game played by the grand coalition and emanating from an arbitrary starting time t and at the corresponding point GC(t). A vectorξ=(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)is an imputation (profit allocation) in Γ(GC(t), t) if ξ satisfies the conditions of individual rationality and Pareto optimality:(22)ξi≥Vi(GC)∀i∈N∑i∈Nξi=V(GC)where Viis the value function of firm i in the noncooperative game of Section 3 and V is the value function of grand coalition in the cooperative game of Section 4. The amount ξiis what firm i stands to receive for the rest of the game by participating in the grand coalition as of time t.Denote by Γ(G0, t0), whereG0=(G1(t0),G2(t0),G3(t0)),the cooperative game of Section 4, played on the time interval [t0, ∞). Before the start of this game, the firms have agreed on the imputation ξ0 which determines the share of the grand coalition’s optimal profit that each firm stands to receive over the time interval [t0, ∞). Using the value functions from Section 3 and Section 4, respectively, on the right-hand sides of (22) yields(23)ξi0≥Vi(G0)=γA22cρ+(γA+2γB)g0+(12(ϵA+ϵB)+2ηA)g02(24)∑i∈Nξi0=V(G0)=3γ22cρ+3γg0+9η2g02.For the cooperative game Γ(G0, t0) to be attractive to the firms, the game must be essential. If it is essential thenV(G0)>∑i=13Vi(G0),i.e., there is something to be gained by cooperating in the grand coalition. Otherwise the problem is trivial as no coalition can achieve more than the individual members can gain for themselves. In what follows we assume that the game is essentialSince firms are identical, it seems fair to give them the same share of the grand coalition’s total profit V(G0), i.e., each firm receivesξi0=V(G0)/3.This imputation obviously satisfies (24) and, under the assumption that the game is essential, we getξi0>Vi(G0)in (23).For an imputation ξ0 to be in the core of Γ(G0, t0), the condition(25)∑j∈Sξj0≥VS(G0)∀S⊂Nmust be satisfied. The condition means that no coalition has an incentive to block the cooperative agreement made at time zero. The condition in (25) can be written asξ10≥V{1}∣{2,3}(G0)ξ20≥V{2}∣{1,3}(G0)ξ30≥V{3}∣{1,2}(G0)ξ10+ξ20≥V{1,2}∣{3}(G0)ξ10+ξ30≥V{1,3}∣{2}(G0)ξ20+ξ30≥V{2,3}∣{1}(G0)where V{i}∣{j, k} is the value function of coalitionS={i}when it plays a zero-sum game with anti-coalitionN∖S={j,k}while V{i, j}∣{k} is the value function of coalitionS={i,j}playing againstN∖S={k}.We need to calculate these value functions and it is useful to divide them into two groups, A and B88Note that the objective functions below are stated for an arbitrary initial timet∈[t0,∞)..Games of Type A:S={i,j}againstN∖S={k}.The objective function of S isJ{i,j}(ai,aj)=∑h∈{i,j}∫t∞e−ρ(s−t)×(π[β−∑l=13Gl(s)]Gh(s)−c2ah2(s))dswhile the objective function of N\S isJ{k}(ak)=−J{i,j}(ai,aj).Games of Type B:S={i}againstN∖S={j,k}.The objective of S isJ{i}(ai)=∫t∞e−ρ(s−t)(π[β−∑l=13Gl(s)]Gi(s)−c2ai2(s))dsand the objective of N\S isJ{j,k}(aj,ak)=−J{i}(ai).Assuming that the deviating coalition moves first, the HJB equations for the zero-sum games played between S and N\S are(26)TypeA:V{i,j}∣{k}(G)=maxai,ajminakJSTypeB:V{i}∣{j,k}(G)=maxaiminaj,akJS.The value (or characteristic) functions on the left-hand sides in (26) represent what the deviating coalition can guarantee itself when they foresee the retaliation from their opponents in the anti-coalition.The calculations of the value functions in the two types of games are straightforward but tedious and have been put into the appendix. The appendix also contains some observations and intuitions pertaining to equilibrium strategiesIn both types of games, A and B, respectively, four cases need to be considered:CaseDeviating coalitionLeft-out coalition1.1No advertisingNo advertising1.2No advertisingPositive advertising rate2.1Positive advertising rateNo advertising2.2Positive advertising ratePositive advertising rateCalculations in the appendix show that Cases 1.1 and 2.1 violate necessary optimality conditions and therefore are discarded. We are left with Cases 1.2 and 2.2. It turns out that in both types of games, A and B, left-out firm(s) always advertise at the maximal rate99Because the right-hand side of the HJB equations are linear in the advertising rate of the left-out players, we need to impose an upper bound on advertising, say,a¯.. This result is driven by the zero-sum game assumption which implies that it is in the best interest of left-out firm(s) to advertise so as to increase their goodwill stock(s) at a maximal rate. The deviating firm(s) may or may not advertise; this will depend on the value of the shadow price(s) of their goodwill stock(s).To guarantee that the cooperative agreement is time consistent, an imputation ξi(GC(t)) must belong to the core in any subgame Γ(GC(t), t), emanating from state GC(t) at time t. This amounts to validating the inequalities(27)ξ1(GC(t))≥V{1}∣{2,3}(GC(t))ξ2(GC(t))≥V{2}∣{1,3}(GC(t))ξ3(GC(t))≥V{3}∣{1,2}(GC(t))ξ1(GC(t))+ξ2(GC(t))≥V{1,2}∣{3}(GC(t))ξ1(GC(t))+ξ3(GC(t))≥V{1,3}∣{2}(GC(t))ξ2(GC(t))+ξ3(GC(t))≥V{2,3}∣{1}(GC(t)).Consider the following imputation:(28)ξi(GC(t))=V(GC(t))3,i∈Nwhich pays one-third of the optimal profit-to-go of the grand coalition to each of the three symmetric firms. This allocation is also known as the egalitarian solution. The conditions in (27) then become(29)13V(GC(t))≥V{i}∣{j,k}(GC(t));23V(GC(t))≥V{i,j}∣{k}(GC(t)).Now, the second inequality in (29) can be rewritten as(30)max(P1+P2+P3)≥32maxmin(P1+P2)in whichPi=∫t∞e−ρ(s−t)(π[β−∑j=13Gj(s)]Gi(s)−c2ai2(s))dsis the profit functional of firm i in a game starting out at time t. Since payoffs Piare equal, the inequality in (30) can be rewritten as max (Pi) ≥ max min (Pi) which is true by definition. We conclude that the imputation in (28) belongs to the core.Recall from Section 4 that the value function in the cooperative game isV(Y)=α+γY+η2Y2whereY=∑i=13Giand α > 0, γ > 0, η < 0 are given by (18) and (19). Using V(Y) we can state the following result.Proposition 5The imputation in (28) can be written asξi(∑i=13GiC(t))=α3+γ3∑i=13GiC(t)+η6(∑i=13GiC(t))2which shows that ξiis a concave function of the total goodwill stock Y(t) of the grand coalition. The total profit that firm i, as a member of the grand coalition, can expect to receive from time t till infinity, is ξi(Y(t)). This amount increases fromα3>0at time zero, reaches a maximum atY(t)=−γ/η=β/2and then decreases to zero atY(t)=β.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The aim of the current research is to study the sustainability of intertemporal cooperation among oligopolistic firms in a particular market for a product or service. For this purpose we suggested a differential games model of advertising competition. The model is deliberately simple: there are three firms only and they are symmetric. The situation that we consider is one where individual firms wish to coordinate their advertising efforts to achieve a common objective, the maximization of their overall profits. Thus, firms try to form and maintain a cartel, the grand coalition.To obtain an agreement to form the grand coalition, any firm must be guaranteed a share of the coalition’s overall profits which exceeds what the firm could earn by acting in its own best interest. To sustain an agreement,more is needed: members of the grand coalition must be compensated in such a way that at no instant of time during the play of the game, no single firm or coalition must have an incentive to defect on the agreement. We have shown that there exists an imputation (profit allocation), and indeed a simple one, which belongs to the core in any subgame played along the cooperative state trajectory. This property guarantees that defections are not profitable.The paper characterized analytically the optimal advertising strategies of the firms in the grand coalition and determined the corresponding state trajectories.Future work in the area could be concerned with the generalization to an arbitrary number of firms, primarily to see how the number of firms in the market may affect the sustainability of a cooperative agreement. Another option would be to assume that firms are asymmetric, to see how differences in advertising costs and efficiency as well as profit margins would influence sustainability. However, an asymmetric game would probably be analytically intractable.This appendix provides the calculations leading to advertising strategies and value functions in games of Types A and B. It also gives some intuitions for the choice of equilibrium advertising strategies.The HJB equation is(31)ρVS∣k(G)=maxahh∈Sminak{π∑h∈S[β−∑j=13Gj]Gh−c2∑h∈Sah2+∑j=13∂VS∣k(G)∂Gjaj}.Necessary conditions for maximization (minimization) of the term in curly brackets in (31) are(32)CoalitionS:ah={1c∂VS∣k(G)∂Gh>0if∂VS∣k(G)∂Gh>0,h∈S0if∂VS∣k(G)∂Gh≤0,h∈Sand(33)Firmk:ak={0if∂VS∣k(G)∂Gk≥0a¯if∂VS∣k(G)∂Gk<0.In (33),a¯is an upper bound on an advertising effort rate1010An upper bound on advertising effort typically reflects that firms have limited advertising budgets. The upper bound is needed since the advertising rate of the minimizing player appears linearly in the maximand.. The intuition of the equilibrium advertising rates in (32) and (33) is the following. If shadow prices ∂VS∣k(G)/∂Ghare positive, it pays for coalition S to increase its goodwill stocks Gh. Hence both members of the coalition should advertise. If the shadow price ∂VS∣k(G)/∂Gkis positive, a marginal increase of the left-out firm’s goodwill stock Gk, when this firm use positive advertising at the rateak=a¯,would increase the profits of coalition S. This is not in the best interest of firm k and hence it should choose not to advertise. On the other hand, if ∂VS∣k(G)/∂Gkis negative, a marginal increase in Gkwould decrease the profits of coalition S. This is desirable for firm k and it should advertise at the maximum rate.Inserting ahand akfrom (32) and (33) into (31) yields four cases to be dealt with.The value function follows directly from the HJB equation:VS∣k(G)=πρ∑h∈S[β−∑j=13Gj]Ghand has the derivatives∂VS∣k∂Gi=∂VS∣k∂Gj=β−2Gi−2Gj−Gk∂VS∣k∂Gk=−Gi−GjFor the case to occur, ∂VS∣k/∂Gimust be nonpositive and ∂VS∣k/∂Gknonnegative. This is not true and we conclude that Case 1.1 cannot occur. Intuitively it makes little sense that all firms should refrain from advertising.The HJB equation readsρVS∣k(G)=π∑h∈S[β−∑j=13Gj]Gh+∂VS∣k(G)∂Gka¯.The following value function is a solution of this equation:VS∣k(G)=−πρ2(Gi+Gj)(a¯−βρ+ρ(Gi+Gj+Gk))and has the partial derivatives∂VS∣k(G)∂Gi=∂VS∣k(G)∂Gj=−πρ2(a¯−βρ+2ρGi+2ρGj+ρGk)∂VS∣k(G)∂Gk=−πρ(Gi+Gj)<0.The sign of the derivative in the second line confirms the choiceako=a¯.Forah=0to hold, we need the derivative with respect to Gibe nonpositive.The HJB equation isρVS∣k(G)=π∑h∈S[β−∑j=13Gj]Gh+12c∑j∈S(∂VS∣k(G)∂Gj)2and we guess that the following value function solves this equation:(34)VS∣k(G)=α+γA(Gi+Gj)+γBGk+ϵA2(Gi2+Gj2)+ϵB2Gk2+ηAGiGj+ηB(GiGk+GjGk)in which α, γA, γB, ϵA, ϵB, ηA, ηBare constants to be determined. The value function in (34) has the partial derivatives∂VS∣k∂Gi=γA+ηBGk+ϵAGi+ηAGj∂VS∣k∂Gj=γA+ηBGk+ϵAGj+ηAGi∂VS∣k∂Gk=γB+ϵBGk+ηB(Gi+Gj)which we insert on the right-hand side of the HJB equation and use (34) on the left-hand side. Then the proposed value function solves the HJB equation if value function parameters satisfy the algebraic equationscργA=γAϵA+γAηA+cπβcργB=2γAηBcρϵA=ϵA2+ηA2−2cπcρϵB=2ηB2cρηA=2ϵAηA−2cπcρηB=ϵAηB+ηAηB−cπ.The parameter α is given byα=γA2/cρ>0.A particular solution to the above equations isγA=β(A−cρ)8>0γB=β(ρA−cρ2−8π)16ρ<0ϵA=ηA=cρ−A4<0ϵB=−ρA−cρ2−8π16ρ>0ηB=cρ−A8<0whereA≜c2ρ2+16πc.We know thatak=0if ∂VS∣k(G)/∂Gk≥ 0. Inserting the above coefficients into the expression for ∂VS∣k/∂Gkyields∂VS∣k(G)∂Gk=ϵB(Gk−β)+ηB(Gi+Gj)<0in whichGk−β<0due to the state constraintGi+Gj+Gk≤β.Since ∂VS∣k/∂Gkis negative, we conclude thatak=0and Case 2.1 cannot occur. The reason is that it does pay for firm k to increase its goodwill stock Gkas much as possible as this is harmful to the deviating coalition.The HJB equation isρVS∣k(G)=π∑h∈S[β−∑j=13Gj]Gh+12c∑j∈S(∂VS∣k(G)∂Gj)2+∂VS∣k(G)∂Gka¯.The value function is(35)VS∣k(G)=α+γA(Gi+Gj)+γBGk+ϵA2(Gi2+Gj2)+ϵB2Gk2+ηAGiGj+ηB(GiGk+GjGk)in which the coefficients satisfy the algebraic equationscρα=γA2+γBa¯cργA=γAϵA+γAηA+cπβ+ηBa¯cργB=2γAηB+ϵBa¯cρϵA=ϵA2+ηA2−2cπcρϵB=2ηB2cρηA=2ϵAηA−2cπcρηB=ϵAηB+ηAηB−cπ.A particular solution of the above equations is given byα=γA2+γBa¯cργA=−a¯4+(A−cρ)(4πβ+a¯ρ)32πγB=−ca¯ρ2−4πa¯+4πcβρ8cρ2+(4πβ+a¯ρ)(A−cρ)64πϵA=ηA=cρ−A4<0ϵB=8π+cρ2−ρA16ρ>0ηB=cρ−A8<0.Cases 1.2 and 2.2 are the only feasible ones and in both of them, the left-out firm advertises at the maximal rate. In Case 1.2 the deviating coalition does not advertise; in Case 2.2 it does.In games of this type, the coalition is a singleton,S={i},and the left-out players are j and k. The HJB equation is(36)ρVs∣{j,k}(G)=maxaiminaj,ak{π[β−∑l=13Gl]Gi−c2ai2+∑l=13∂VS∣j,k(G)∂Gial}.Necessary conditions for maximization (minimization) of the term in curly brackets in (36) areCoalitionS:ai={1c∂VS∣{j,k}(G)∂Gi>0if∂VS∣{j,k}(G)∂Gi>00if∂VS∣{j,k}(G)∂Gi≤0Left-outfirmh∈{j,k}:ah={0if∂VS∣{j,k}(G)∂Gh≥0a¯if∂VS∣{j,k}(G)∂Gh<0.Again, there are four cases to deal with.The HJB equation, after substitution of the assumed advertising rates, isρVi∣{j,k}=π[β−∑l=13Gl]Giwhich is the same as in games of Type A and we conclude that this case cannot occur.The HJB equation isρVi∣{j,k}=π[β−∑l=13Gl]Gi+(∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gj+∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gk)a¯and the following value function solves this equation:Vi∣{j,k}=πρ2[(ρβ−2a¯)Gi−ρGi2−ρGiGj−ρGiGk].For Case 1.2 to happen it must hold that ∂Vi∣{j, k}/∂Giis nonpositive while ∂Vi∣{j, k}/∂Gjand ∂Vi∣{j, k}/∂Gjmust be negative. The latter derivatives both equal−πGi/ρ<0.The former is∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gi=−πρ2(2a¯−βρ+2ρGi+ρGj+ρGk)and is nonpositive if2a¯≥βρ−2ρGi−ρGj−ρGk.The HJB equation isρVi∣{j,k}=π[β−∑l=13Gl]Gi+12c(∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gi)2and we guess that the value function isVi|{j,k}(G)=α+γiGi+ϵB2Gi2+γ(Gj+Gk)+ϵA2(Gj+Gk)2+ηAGi(Gj+Gk).For the value function to solve the HJB equation, the parameters must satisfyϵA=ηB=4π−ρA+cρ28ρ>0ϵB=cρ−A2<0ηA=cρ−A4<0γi=−β(A+cρ)4<0γ=−β(4π+cρ2−ρA)8ρ<0.The partial derivatives of the value function must satisfy the following sign requirements for Case 2.1 to occur:∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gi=γi+ϵBGi+ηA(Gj+Gk)>0∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gj=∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gk=γ+ηAGi+ϵA(Gj+Gk)≥0.The partial derivative ∂Vi∣{j, k}/∂Giequalsγi+ϵBGi+ηAGj+ηAGkand is negative. This contradicts ai> 0 and hence the case cannot occur.The HJB equation isρVi∣{j,k}=π[β−∑l=13Gl]Gi+12c(∂Vi∣{j,k]∂Gi)2+(∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gj+∂Vi∣{j,k}∂Gk)a¯and we guess that the value function is given byVi|{j,k}(G)=α+γiGi+γjGj+γkGk+ϵA2(Gj2+Gk2)+ϵB2Gi2+ηAGi(Gj+Gk)+ηBGjGk.To satisfy the HJB equation, the coefficients of the value function must solve the algebraic equationscρα=γi22+γja¯+γka¯cργi=γiϵB+cπβ+ηA(a¯+a¯)cργj=γiηA+ϵAa¯+ηBa¯cργk=γiηA+ϵAa¯+ηBa¯cρϵA=ηA2cρϵB=ϵB2−2πccρηA=ϵBηA−πccρηB=ηA2.These equations have the following solution in whichA≜c2ρ2+8πc:ϵA=ηB=4π−ρA+cρ28ρ>0ϵB=cρ−A2<0ηA=cρ−A4<0γi=−4πa¯−(πβ+a¯ρ)A+ca¯ρ2+πcβρ4πγj=γk=−c2a¯ρ4−8π2a¯+πc2βρ3+4πca¯ρ2+4π2cβρ−cρ2(πβ+a¯ρ)A8πcρ2For Case 2.2 to occur, the partial derivatives of the value function must satisfy∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gi=γi+ϵBGi+ηA(Gj+Gk)>0∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gj=∂Vi|{j,k}(G)∂Gk=γj+ηAGi+ϵA(Gj+Gk)<0.As for Type A games, we conclude that Cases 1.2 and 2.2 are the only feasible ones. Left-out firms always advertise at the maximal rate. In Case 1.2 the deviating firm does not advertise; in Case 2.2 it does.
