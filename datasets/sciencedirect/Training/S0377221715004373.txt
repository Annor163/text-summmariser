@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper develops a slack-based decomposition of profit efficiency based on a directional distance function. It is an alternative to Cooper, Pastor, Aparicio, and Borras (2011).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1998) introduced an additive decomposition of profit efficiency based on the directional technology distance function.11Luenberger introduced this function as a “shortage function”, see e.g., Luenberger (1995).Under suitable regularity conditions on technology, this distance function has the indication property that it equals zero if and only if the input–output vector belongs to the g-isoquant (see Färe & Grosskopf, 2010). A Leontief technology is an example for which the isoquant may be larger than the Pareto–Koopmans efficiency set. Thus the Chambers et al. decomposition does not account for slacks.This observation has prompted Cooper, Pastor, Aparicio, and Borras (2011) to “...show that the usual measure of profit inefficiency can be decomposed into its technical component, measured through a weighted additive model, and its allocative component derived as a residual. Our findings are all based on Fenchel–Mahler inequality using duality theory (see Färe and Grosskopf, 2000, p. 411)”.In this paper we introduce an alternative model to Cooper et al. (2011) using a slack-based directional technology distance function introduced by Färe and Grosskopf (2010). We combine this function with the fact that the profit maximum is at least as large as the profit from any feasible input–output vector.In the next section, after discussing profit-maximization, we recall the Chambers et al. (1998) decomposition. Then we introduce our new decomposition of profit efficiency using a slack-based directional technology distance function.Denote inputs by a column vectorx=(x1,…,xN)′∈R+Nand outputs by a column vectory=(y1,…,yM)′∈R+M; the production technology is given by(1)T={(x,y):xcanproducey}which we assume satisfies standard regularity conditions, and strong disposability of inputs and outputs in particular.22See Färe and Primont (1995) for an axiomatic discussion of T.Letw=(w1,…,wN)∈R+Nbe a row vector of input prices andp=(p1,…,pM)∈R+M,be a row vector of output prices. The profit function is defined as33See Färe and Primont (1995) for details about existence and other properties of this function.(2)π(p,w)=max(x,y){py−wx:(x,y)∈T}.This definition implies that(3)π(p,w)≧py−wx,∀(x,y)∈Twhich is the first of our building blocks.Next, introduce the directional vectorg=(gx,gy)∈R+N+M:g≠0.This vector determines the direction in which the input–output vector is projected onto the boundary of T.To recall the Chambers et al. (1998) decomposition, we define the directional technology distance function(4)DT→(x,y;g)=maxβ{β∈R+:(x−βgx,y+βgy)∈T}.This function is defined to contract inputs and expand outputs, as in profit maximization, except that the optimization for it is done along the chosen directiong=(gx,gy). In particular, note that(x−β*gx,y+β*gy)∈Twhere β* is the optimizer in (4), i.e.,DT→(x,y;g). It is important to note that the directional vector has units of measurement, which makes the scalar β and the directional distance function independent of units of measurement.Combining this with the profit inequality yields, ∀(x, y) ∈ T(5)π(p,w)≧p(y+β*gy)−w(x−β*gx)=(py−wx)+β*(pgy+wgx)or, for(pgy+wgx)≠0,we have(6)π(p,w)−(py−wx)(pgy+wgx)≧DT→(x,y;g),∀(x,y)∈Tand adding allocative efficiency to the right hand side closes the inequality. This is the Chambers et al. decomposition.Note that if all prices (on the left hand side of (6)) are scaled by λ > 0, the efficiency score does not change, thus we may use US Dollar or Swedish kroner as the unit and the results will be the same. Again, this decomposition would result in slacks being captured by the residual rather than by technical inefficiency.Following Färe and Grosskopf (2010), the slack-based directional technology distance function, when the direction vector is chosen to be the unit vector, i.e.,g=1=(1,…,1),is(7)SBDT→(x,y;1)=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(x1−β1·1,…,xN−βN·1,y1+γ1·1,…,yM+γM·1)∈T}where the optimization is done overB=(β1,…,βN)≧0,Γ=(γ1,…,γM)≧0.44In this paper we focus on efficiency measurement, so we consider only points that belong to the technology set and this requires the non-negativity constraint, to ensure that the reference point on the frontier is obtained by not increasing any of the inputs (i.e., contracting or keeping constant) and by not decreasing any outputs (i.e., expanding or keeping constant). It is possible to extend this measure to the case when a point does not belong to the technology set (e.g., for measuring productivity changes), and for such points the non-negativity constraints should be changed to a non-positivity constraint for analogous reasons, in addition to feasibility of the solution assumption. We thank an anonymous referee for this remark and leave further details for future work.It is worth noting that the g vector here equals one unit for each element,55To clarify the notation further, note that we explicitly write the multiplication by 1 to emphasize that in each instance it is multiplication by the unit of measurement corresponding to each different input or output, e.g., the first element in 1 could stand for 1 litre of petrol, the second could stand for 1 hour of labour, the last two could stand for 1 kg of apples and 1 kg of oranges, respectively, etc. Also, see appendix for the proof of independence from units of measurement of this measure.and so has a unit measure, making β’s and γ’s independent of units of measurement and hence they can be summed.66Note that ifgx=xandgy=ythen we have a Russell-type efficiency measure defined on T. See Färe, Fukuyama, Grosskopf, and Zelenyuk (2015) for a related discussion.LetB*=(β1*,…,βN*),Γ*=(γ1*,…,γM*)be the optimizers in (7), then under standard regularity conditions on technology set T with strong disposability of inputs and outputs,SBDT→(x,y;1)=0if and only if(β1*,…,βN*,γ1*,…,γM*)=0. Thus, ifSBDT→(x,y;1)=0we say that each xnand ymis technically efficient, i.e., (x, y) is on the (Pareto–Koopmans) efficient frontier of the technology set T.In the appendix we show thatSBDT→(x,y;1)is independent of units of measurement. The proof also shows that each component in(β1*,…,βN*,γ1*,…,γM*)is unit independent.CombiningSBDT→(x,y;1)with the profit inefficiency, yields(8)π(p,w)≧∑m=1Mpmym+∑m=1Mpmγm*·1−∑n=1Nwnxn+∑n=1Nwnβn*·1,∀(x,y)∈TFrom Eq. (8) it follows that, ∀(x, y) ∈ T(9)π(p,w)−(py−wx)≧∑m=1Mpmγm*·1+∑n=1Nwnβn*·1As in the Chambers et al. case, we can normalize with the value of the directional vector, which isg=1here, i.e.,(∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1),which yields(10)π(p,w)−(py−wx)(∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1)≧∑m=1Mpmγm*·1∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1+∑n=1Nwnβn*·1∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1,∀(x,y)∈TDefine the price-share weightssm=pm·1∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1,m=1,…,Mandsn=wn·1∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1,n=1,…,N,then sm≧0 and sn≧0 for allm=1,…,Mandn=1,…,Nand∑m=1Msm+∑n=1Nsn=1. With these weights, we have(11)π(p,w)−(py−wx)(∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1)≧∑m=1Msmγm*+∑n=1Nsnβn*,∀(x,y)∈Tas the basis of our decomposition, with allocative inefficiency defined as the residual.Next, note that we should have∑m=1Mpmγm*+∑n=1Nwnβn*>0if and only ifSBDT→(x,y;1)=∑m=1Mγm*+∑n=1Nβn*>0,because(β1*,…,βN*,γ1*,…,γM*)≧0. So, for the case whenSBDT→(x,y;1)>0we can multiply and divide the right hand side of (11) withSBDT→(x,y;1),to get(12)π(p,w)−(py−wx)(∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1)≧SBDT→(x,y;1)×(∑m=1Msmγm*∑m=1Mγm*+∑n=1Nβn*+∑n=1Nsnβn*∑m=1Mγm*+∑n=1Nβn*),∀(x,y)∈Twhere the right hand side is a measure of technical efficiency. The new decomposition follows from adding an allocative inefficiency term.77Note that the left hand side of (12) is the ratio of profit differences and the value of the directional vector, hence it is independent of the units of measurement.Obviousely, (10), (11) and (12) are equivalent, however, (12) allows us to identify the contribution of each input and output as a share of the total technical inefficiency.88Also note that the same function (SBDT→) appears both inside and outside the parentheses of the decomposition on the right hand side of (12). Such mathematical rearrangement is commonly used in other instances in performance measurement. For example, the same distance functions appear inside and outside of parentheses to arrive at decompositions of Malmquist productivity indexes (e.g., see Färe, Grosskopf, Norris, and Zhang (1994)).To take a closer look at the results, note that the right hand side of (12) is a product of two parts, theSBDT→(x,y;1)itself and a share weighted sum of various optimal values from (7). Let us concentrate on the mth term of the second part of this formula. This term can be seen as: (i) the mth output inefficiencyγm*∑m=1Mγm*+∑n=1Nβn*and (ii) weightssm=pm·1(∑m=1Mpm·1+∑n=1Nwn·1). That is, the expression in the parentheses consists of the share weighted sum (share of the value of the directional vector) of the individual input and output inefficiencies. Note that we have∑i=1N+Msi=1and si≧0. Incidentally, also note that ifγm=βn=βforn=1,…,Nandm=1,…,M,then the Chambers et al. decomposition is obtained as a special case. Also note that this decomposition is new to the literature and it is possible to adapt it to produce a similar decomposition for the Russell-based directional distance function (see Fukuyama & Weber, 2009).Finally, a natural approach to estimate these measures in practice from data is to adapt the data envelopment analysis approach (see Farrell (1957), Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984); Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) for the origins) in a similar fashion as in Cooper et al. (2011) and Färe et al. (2015).To show thatSBDT→(x,y;1)is independent of the units of measurement, let Ωxand Ωybe arbitrary strictly positive diagonal matrices that transform the units of measurement of, respectively, inputs and outputs (x and y), intox˜=Ωxxandy˜=Ωyy,so that(x,y)∈T⇔(x˜,y˜)∈T˜,whereT˜is T expressed in the new units of measurement, i.e.,T˜={(x˜,y˜):x˜=Ωxxcanproducey˜=Ωyy}Furthermore, let1˜=(1·u1,…,1·uN;1·v1,…,1·vM)be the direction vector defining the units corresponding to(x˜;y˜). Now, note thatSBDT˜→(x˜,y˜;1˜)=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(x˜1−β1·1˜,…,x˜N−βN·1˜,y˜1+γ1·1˜,…,y˜M+γM·1˜)∈T˜}SBDT˜→a.=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(x˜1−β1·1·u1,…,x˜N−βN·1·uN,y˜1+γ1·1·v1,…,y˜M+γM·1·vM)∈T˜}=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(u1(x1−β1·1),…,uN(xN−βN·1),v1(y1+γ1·1),…,vM(yM+γM·1))∈T˜}=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(Ωx(x1−β1·1,…,xN−βN·1),Ωy(y1+γ1·1,…,yM+γM·1))∈T˜}=max{∑n=1Nβn+∑m=1Mγm:(x1−β1·1,…,xN−βN·1,y1+γ1·1,…,yM+γM·1)∈T}=SBDT→(x,y;1).Thus, for any scalar-type transformation of units of measurement given byx˜=Ωxxandy˜=Ωyy,we haveSBDT˜→(x˜,y˜;1˜)=SBDT→(x,y;1).
