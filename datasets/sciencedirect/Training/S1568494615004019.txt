Certain type of linguistic terms such as satisfactory, good, very good and excellent have an order among them. In this paper we introduce a new concept of soft sets with some order among the parameters. Some properties of lattice ordered soft sets are given. Lattice ordered soft sets are very useful in particular type of decision making problems where some order exists among the elements of parameters set.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In daily life, one usually comes across with linguistic terms having certain order among them. That is, a ranking exist in these terms. For example to tell the quality of a certain product a sale person employee terms like unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, very good, and excellent. Clearly these terms have an order among them. This type of ranking, to explain the quality of a product helps the customers to select a particular brand of a product. In mathematics partial ordered sets or lattices provide a very nice abstraction for such notions.Fuzzy set theory [17] is a very nice tool to handle linguistic terms, particularly when there exists some order among them. But defining a membership grade for the elements of a set is a major difficulty in fuzzy set theory [15]. This difficulty may be due to lack of parameterization tools in fuzzy sets [15]. Therefore Molodtsov introduced the concept of soft sets. In soft sets theory there are enough number of parameters available to handle uncertainty, so that its free from difficulties associated with fuzzy sets. Another advantage of soft set theory is that, it can preserve crisp or fuzzy data in a very nice way. At present fuzzy sets, rough sets and soft sets are among major tools to deal with uncertainty. These theories are quite different in their nature yet authors try establish some linkage among them. For details see [1,4,8].During recent years soft set theory has emerged as a new mathematical tool to deal with uncertainty. Due to its applications in diverse fields researchers, practitioners and mathematicians are taking keen interest in it. Now literature is quite rich on applications of soft sets ranging from algebra to decision making. For details see [2,5,7,10,11,13]As mentioned above, sometimes linguistic terms have particular ranking among them. These terms can be considered as parameters, so the collection of such terms give rise to a parameters set. For example, in a class of an educational institute to establish a ranking among student's performance, we say good students of the class, it may mean those students who obtained over seventy percent marks. Similarly when we say very good or excellent students, it may mean those students who got more that eighty or ninety percent marks respectively. In this situation there is an order among the terms (parameters) good, very good and excellent. This situation gives rise to idea of an anti-lattice order soft set because number of students may decrease as percentage of obtained marks goes higher. According to our knowledge, in soft set theory up-till now, no study exists where an order has been considered among the elements of parameters set. Moreover order among the parameters may not be linear, therefore in the present paper we introduce the notion of lattice (anti-lattice) ordered soft sets. It is well known that a soft set is a map from the set of parameters to the power set of the universe set. If set of parameters is a lattice then a monotone or an isotone map give rise to the notions of lattice ordered soft sets and anti-lattice ordered soft sets respectively. Therefore it is imperative to study such soft sets, where some type of ranking exists among the elements of parameters set.This paper has been arranged as the following. In Section 2, some basic notions about lattices and soft set sets are given. These notions will be employed in the sequel. Concept of lattice (anti-lattice) ordered soft set is introduced in Section 3. In the same section some properties of these are studied. Algebraic structures of lattice (anti-lattice) ordered soft sets are investigated in Section 4. Lattice (anti-lattice) ordered soft set soft sets can be very helpful in decision making problems, where set of parameters have an order among its elements. An example is given in Section 5, to explain this idea. This example is verified by well known technique of TOPSIS.In this section some basic notions and results about lattices and soft sets are given. These terms will be required in the sequel. A binary relation ≤ defined on a non-empty set A is called a partial order on the set A if it is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. If in addition, for every a,b∈A, such that a≠b, either a≤b or b≤a, then we say ≤ is total order on A. A non-empty set with partial order on it is called a partially ordered set, or more briefly a poset. And if the relation is a total order then we speak it a totally ordered set or simply a chain.A lattice L is a poset in which for all a, b∈L the set {a, b} has a supremum ″∨″and an infimum ″∧″. If there are elements 0 and 1 in L such that 0≤x and x≤1 for all x∈L. Then L is called a bounded lattice. A lattice in which either of the distributive laws hold is called distributive lattice. If De Morgan's laws hold for a bounded distributive lattice having an involution, then it is called a De Morgan's lattice or De Morgan's algebra. A De Morgan's algebra (L, ∧, ∨,c, 0, 1) that satisfies x∧xc≤y∨ycfor all x, y∈L, is called Kleene algebra.Next some notions about soft sets are given.Definition 1[15] Let U be an initial universe, E be the set of all possible parameters under consideration with respect to U and A be a subset of E. Then a pair (F, A) is called a soft set over U, where F is a mappingF:A→P(U).Definition 2[12] For two soft sets (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U, we say that (F, A) is a soft subset of (G, B) if1A⊆B andF(e)⊆G(e) for all e∈A.We write(F,A)⊂˜(G,B). In this case (G, B) is said to be a soft super set of (F, A).Definition 3[12] Two soft sets (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U are said to be soft equal if (F, A) is a soft subset of (G, B) and (G, B) is a soft subset of (F, A).Definition 4For two soft sets (F, A)and (G, B) over a common universe U, we say that (F, A) is a soft twisted subset of (G, B) if1A⊆B andG(a)⊆F(a) for all a∈A.We write(F,A)⊂ˆ(G,B). In this case (G, B) is said to be a soft twisted super set of (F, A). If A=B then (F, A) is a soft twisted subset of (G, B) if and only if (G, B) is a soft subset of (F, A).It should be noted that (F, A) is soft equal to (G, B) if (F, A) is a soft twisted subset of (G, B) and (G, B) is a soft twisted subset of (F, A).Example 1Let U={h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7} be a set. Let A={e1, e2, e3, e4}, B={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5} be sets of parameters. Consider the soft sets (F, A) and (G, B)such that (F, A)={F(e1)={h1, h2, h3, h4}, F(e2)={h1, h4}, F(e3)={h1, h2, h3, h6, h7}, F(e4)={h1, h6, h7}}, (G, B)={G(e1)={h1, h2, h4}, G(e2)={h1, h4}, G(e3)={h1, h2, h7}, G(e4)={h1, h6}, G(e5)={h1, h4}}. Clearly A⊆B and G(a)⊆F(a) for all a∈A. Therefore(F,A)⊂ˆ(G,B).Definition 5[3] Let U be an initial universe set, E be the set of parameters, and A⊆E.(a)(F, A) is called a relative null soft set (with respect to the parameter set A), denoted by ∅A, if F(a)=∅ for all a∈A.(G, A) is called a relative whole soft set (with respect to the parameter set A), denoted byUA, if G(e)=U for all e∈A.The relative whole soft set with respect to the set of parameters E is called the absolute soft set over U and simply denoted byUE. In a similar way, the relative null soft set with respect to E is called the null soft set over U and is denoted by ∅E.We shall denote by ∅∅ the unique soft set over U with an empty parameter set, which is called the empty soft set over U. Note that ∅∅ and ∅Aare different soft sets over U and∅∅⊂˜∅A⊂˜(F,A)⊂˜UA⊂˜UEfor all soft set (F, A) over U.Definition 6[3] Let (F, A) and (G, B) be two soft sets over the same universe U, such that A∩B≠∅. The restricted union of (F, A) and (G, B) is denoted by(F,A)∪R(G,B)and is defined as(F,A)∪R(G,B)=(H,C), where C=A∩B and for all e∈C, H(e)=F(e)∪G(e).If A∩B=∅, then(F,A)∪R(G,B)=∅∅.Definition 7[3] Let (F, A) and (G, B) be two soft sets over the same universe U such that A∩B≠∅. The restricted intersection of (F, A) and (G, B) is denoted by(F,A)∩R(G,B)and is defined as(F,A)∩R(G,B)=(H,A∩B) where H(e)=F(e)∩G(e) for all e∈A∩B.If A∩B=∅ then(F,A)∩R(G,B)=∅∅.Definition 8[3] Extended union of two soft sets (F, A) and (G, B) over the common universe U is the soft set (H,C), where C=A∪B and for all e∈C,H(e)=F(e)ife∈A−BG(e)ife∈B−AF(e)∪G(e)ife∈A∩BWe write(F,A)∪E(G,B)=(H,C).Definition 9[3]The extended intersection of two soft sets (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U, is the soft set (H,C) where C=A∪B and for all e∈C,H(e)=F(e)ife∈A−BG(e)ife∈B−AF(e)∩G(e)ife∈A∩BWe write(F,A)∩E(G,B)=(H,C).Definition 10[16] Let (F, A) and (G, B) be any two soft sets over a common universe U. Then the basic union of (F, A) and (G, B) is defined as the soft set (H, C)=(F, A)∨(G, B), where C=A×B, and H(a, b)=F(a)∪G(b) for all (a, b)∈A×B.Definition 11[16] Let (F, A) and (G, B) be any two soft sets over a common universe U. Then the basic intersection of (F, A) and (G, B) is defined as the soft set (H, C)=(F, A)∧(G, B), where C=A×B, and H(a, b)=F(a)∩G(b) for all (a, b)∈A×B.Definition 12[14] Let E be a set of parameters and A, B⊆E. For (a, b)∈A×B, (aandb) is called the conjunction parameter of (a, b), and (aorb) is called the disjunction parameter of ordered pair (a, b). These denoted by (a∧b) and (a∨b) respectively.We denoteA⊗B={(a∧b):(a,b)∈A×B}AlsoA⊕B={(a∨b):(a,b)∈A×B}Definition 13[14] LetF,AandG,Bbe two soft sets over the same universe U. ThenaF,A∩∧G,B=H,A⊗Bis the soft set defined as H(a∧b)=F(e)∩G(e) for all a∧b∈A⊗B.F,A∪∨G,B=H,A⊕Bis the soft set defined asHa∨b=F(e)∪G(e)for alla∨b∈A⊕B.Definition 14[3] LetF,AandG,Bbe two soft sets over the same universe U, such that A∩B≠∅. The restricted difference ofF,AandG,Bis denoted byF,A⌣RG,Band is defined asF,A⌣RG,B=(H,A∩B) where H(e)=F(e)−G(e) for all e∈A∩B.If A∩B=∅ thenF,A⌣RG,B=∅∅.Definition 15[3]The complement of a soft setF,Ais denoted byF,Acand is defined byF,Ac=(Fc,A) where Fc:A→P(U) is mapping given byFce=U−Fefor all e∈A.ClearlyF,Ac=UA⌣RF,AandF,Acc=F,AIn daily life, there exist many situations where linguistic terms have a certain type of order among them. In the following it is shown that soft sets have ability to handle such situations. It is well known thatP(U)is a bounded lattice with respect to operations of intersection and union, and set inclusion as a partial order. If the set of parameters E is also a lattice with respect to certain binary operations or partial order, then a non-empty subset A of E also inherits the partial order from the set E. From here onwards E the universal set of parameters will denote a lattice unless stated otherwise. In this section some operations on lattice order and anti-lattice order soft sets are being studied.Definition 16A soft setF,Ais called a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set if for the mappingF:A→P(U), x≤y impliesFx⊆FyFy⊆Fx. For all x,y∈A⊆E.Example 2Let U={u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6,u7} be a set of designs for necklaces and A={e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6} be the set of parameters to represent manufacturing materials. e1represents bronze, e2 represents Silver, e3 represents Gold, e4 represents white Gold, e5 represents Platinum, e6 represents Diamond. Then order among the elements of set A is as shown in Fig. 1.F:A⟶P(U)is a mapping representing the high cost. Therefore soft setF,Ashowing high cost for a design in a particular material may be considered as{Fe1=u4,Fe2=u4,u5,Fe3=u2,u4,Fe4={u2,u4,u5},Fe5={u1,u3,u5,u6},Fe6={u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6,u7}}. For computer applications it is convenient to represent a soft set in tabular form. Table 1, represents the soft set (F, A). If a design in set U has high cost for a material we write 1, otherwise 0.From Table 1, it is clearFe1⊆Fe2⊆Fe4⊆Fe6andFe1⊆Fe3⊆Fe4⊆Fe6. ThusF,Arepresents a lattice ordered soft set.Let U={s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6} be the set of six stores (universe set) and B={b1,b2,b3,b4}, whereb1; Large stores.b2; Very large stores.b3; Huge stores.b4; Very huge stores.Then clearly there is an order in the elements of parameters set B. This order can be described as b1≤b2≤b3≤b4. Soft setG,Bmay be represented by{Gb1={s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6},Gb2={s2,s3,s4,s5},Gb3={s2,s3,s5},Gb4={s2}}. Tabular form for the soft setG,Bis given in Table 2.Clearly G(b1)⊇G(b2)⊇G(b3)⊇G(b4). Thus (G, B) is an anti-lattice ordered soft set.In the following we study some basic properties of latticeanti−latticeordered soft sets.Proposition 1Restricted union of two latticeanti−latticeordered soft setsF,AandG,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofLetF,AandG,Bbe latticeanti−latticeordered soft sets. ThenF,A∪RG,B=(H,C), where C=A∩B. If A∩B=∅, then the required result holds trivially. Now consider A∩B≠∅. Since A, B⊆E, so both A and B inherit the partial order from E. Therefore for any a1≤Aa2 we haveFa1⊆Fa2for all a1,a2∈A. Also for any b1≤Bb2, we haveGb1⊆Gb2for all b1,b2∈B. Therefore for any c1, c2∈C,Fc1⊆Fc2andGc1⊆Gc2. AlsoFc1∪Gc1⊆Fc2∪Gc2this impliesHc1⊆Hc2for c1≤Cc2. ThusF,A∪RG,Bis a lattice ordered soft set. Similarly the result can be shown for anti-lattice ordered soft sets.□Proposition 2Restricted intersection of two latticeanti−latticeordered soft setsF,AandG,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofProof is similar to Proposition 1.□It is easy to note that for lattice (anti-lattice) ordered soft sets the operation∪Rdistributes over∩Rand vice versa.The following examples shows that the extended intersection and extended union of two lattice ordered soft sets may not be a lattice ordered soft set.Example 4LetE=e1,e2,e3,e4,e5with lattice order as shown in Fig. 2. LetA=e1,e2,e3,e4,B=e1,e2,e4,e5. Consider (F,A) andG,Bas lattice ordered soft set over a set U={u1,u2,u3,u4,u5} as shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.Here F(e1)⊆F(e2)⊆F(e4), F(e1)⊆F(e3)⊆F(e4) and G(e1)⊆G(e2)⊆G(e4)⊆G(e5). Then their extended intersection(F,A)∩ɛG,B=H,C, where C=A∪B={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5} is given in Table 5.From Table 5, we have H(e1)⊆H(e2)⊆H(e3) and H(e1)⊆H(e4)⊆H(e5) but H(e3)⊈H(e5) soH,Cis not a lattice ordered soft set. Similarly extended union(F,A)∪ɛG,B=K,Cis given in Table 6.From Table 6, it is clear that K(e1)⊆K(e2)⊆K(e5)⊆K(e4) but K(e3)⊈K(e5) and K(e4)⊈K(e5), soK,Cis not a lattice ordered soft set.In above example it is seen that, in general, extended intersection of lattice ordered soft sets may not be a lattice ordered soft set also extended union of lattice ordered soft sets may not be a lattice ordered soft set. However we have the following.Proposition 3Extended union of two latticeanti−latticeordered soft setsF,AandG,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set if eitherF,A⊂˜G,BorG,B⊂˜F,A.ProofLetF,AandG,Bbe lattice ordered soft sets, without any loss of generality we may haveF,A⊂˜G,Bwhere A⊆B and F(a)⊆G(a) for all a∈A. LetF,A∪ɛG,B=(H,C), where C=A∪B as A⊆B then C=B this implies thatHc=G(c)for all c∈C. So (H,C)=G,BandG,Bis lattice ordered soft set.□It is interesting to see that, the complement of a lattice ordered soft set (F,A) is denoted by (F, A)cand defined by (F, A)c=(Fc,A), whereFc:A→P(U)is a mapping given by Fc(a)=U−F(a) for all a∈A, is an anti-lattice ordered soft set.Similarly the compliment of a anti-lattice ordered soft set is a lattice ordered soft set.Proposition 4Let (F,A) and (G,B) be two latticeanti−latticeordered soft sets over the same universe U. Then((F,A)∪R(G,B))c=(K,A)c∩R(G,B)c((F,A)∩R(G,B))c=(F,A)c∪R(G,B)c.Let A, B be partially ordered sets. Then partial order on A×B is defined by dictionary order, which is fora1,b1,a2,b2∈A×Bwe havea1,b1≤a2,b2if and only if a1≤Aa2 or if a1=a2 and b1≤Bb2. It is well known that a restriction of a partial order is again a partial, so we consider the partial order ⪯ on A×B by defining,a1,b1⪯a2,b2if and only if a1≤Aa2 and b1≤Bb2. For the rest of the paper this order ⪯ will be considered on A×B.Proposition 5Basic intersection of two latticeanti−latticeordered soft setsF,AandG,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofLetF,AandG,Bbe lattice ordered soft sets. ThenF,A∧G,B=(H,C), where C=A×B. Since A, B⊆E, so both A and B inherit a partial order from E. Therefore for any a1≤Aa2 we haveFa1⊆Fa2for all a1,a2∈A. Also for any b1≤Bb2 we haveGb1⊆Gb2for all b1,b2∈B. Therefore for anya1,b1,a2,b2∈C. Now ⪯ is the partial order on C which is induced by partial orders on A and B. Ifa1,b1⪯a2,b2thenFa1⊆Fa2andGb1⊆Gb2impliesFa1∩Gb1⊆Fa2∩Gb2this impliesHa1,b1⊆Ha2,b2fora1,b1⪯Ca2,b2. ThusF,A∧G,Bis a lattice ordered soft set. Similarly the result can be shown for anti-lattice ordered soft sets.□Proposition 6Basic union of two latticeanti−latticeordered soft setsF,AandG,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofProof follows from Definition 10 and Proposition 5.□If A, B are any subsets of E then the partial order ≲ on A⊗B is induced by partial order on A and B in the following manner. For anya1,b1,a2,b2∈A⊗B,a1∧b1≲a2∧b2if and only if a1≤Aa2 and b1≤Bb2. Also define ⪅ as an order on A⊕B and for anya1,b1,a2,b2∈A⊕B,a1∨b1⪅a2∨b2if and only if a1≤Aa2 and b1≤Bb2.Proposition 7IfF,AandG,Bare latticeanti−latticeordered soft sets, thenF,A∩∧G,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofLetF,AandG,Bare two lattice ordered soft sets (i.e. for a1,a2∈A, F(a1)⊆F(a2)) when ever a1≤Aa2 and for b1,b2∈B, G(b1)⊆G(b2) when ever b1≤Bb2). we have to prove thatF,A∩∧G,Blattice ordered soft set. We know thatbydefinition 13F,A∩∧G,B=H,A⊗Bwhere H(a1∧b1)=F(a1)∩G(b1) for all (a1∧b1)∈A⊗B and H(a2∧b2)=F(a2)∩G(b2) for all (a2∧b2)∈A⊗B. so it is always H(a1∧b1)⊆H(a2∧b2) when ever (a1∧b1)≲A⊗B(a2∧b2).Similarly the result can be shown for anti-lattice ordered soft sets.□Proposition 8IfF,AandG,Bare latticeanti−latticeordered soft sets, thenF,A∪∨G,Bis a latticeanti−latticeordered soft set.ProofProof follows from Proposition7.□It is interesting to see that what kind of algebraic structures is associated with lattice ordered soft sets. Such study will be helpful for their application in daily life situations. In this section, study of algebraic structures of lattice ordered soft is initiated. For this we set the following conventions.LSUE;The collection of all lattice ordered soft sets defined over U.LSUA;The collection of all lattice ordered soft sets defined over U with a fixed set of parameters A.It is easy to see that1(LSUE,∪R)and(LSUE,∩R)are monoids.LSUE,∪R,∩RandLSUL,∩R,∪Rare hemirings.The following Proposition shows that absorption laws hold inLSUA.Proposition 9LetF,AandG,Bbe two lattice ordered soft sets then1.F,A∩R(F,A∪RG,B)=F,A2.F,A∪R(F,A∩RG,B)=F,AProofProof follows from applications of respective definitions.□It is well know that forLSUA, operations of extended union and extended intersections coincide with the operations of restricted union and restricted intersections, respectively. So there are only two latticesLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Rand(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪R).Theorem 10LSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Rand(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪R)are bounded lattices.ProofIt is easy to see thatLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Ris a hemiring. From Proposition9,we have absorption laws hold here, soLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Ris bounded lattice with ∅AandUAas minimal and maximal elements.Similarly it can be shown that(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪R)is a bounded lattice.□Theorem 11LSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Rand(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪Rare Boolean algebras.ProofLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Ris lattice by Theorem10.LetF,A∈LSUAthen following holdF,A∪RF,Ac=UAF,A∩RF,Ac=∅Athat isLSUAis complemented lattice soLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Ris a Boolean algebra.Similarly it can be shown that(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪Ris a Boolean algebra.□Since De Morgan's laws hold forLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Rtherefore it is a De Morgan's algebra.LetF,A,(G,A)∈LSUA. Then we can see that(F,A)∩R(F,A)c⊂˜(G,A)∪R(G,A)c. This shows that (LSUA, ∅A,UA,∪R,∩R)is a Kleene algebra.As we know thatF,A∩RF,Ac=∅Aand wheneverF,A∩R(G,A)=∅Athen(G,A)⊂˜F,Ac. This shows thatF,Acis a pseudocomplement ofF,A. FurthermoreF,Ac∪RF,Acc=UA, that is Stone's identity holds inLSUA,∅A,UA,∪R,∩Rtherefore it is a Stone algebra. Similarly it can be shown that(LSUA,UA,∅A,∩R,∪Ris a Stone algebra.Decision making problems, where parameters have an order among them in such a way that they give rise to lattice ordered soft sets can be handheld very easily. Linguistic terms, when treated as parameters may have an order of importance given by the decision makers. Lattice ordered soft sets help us for multi-criteria decision making, when two are more agents are involved in the process of decision making. In the following, an example is given to explain this idea. For the simplicity only two agents have been considered for the decision making process.Example 5LetU=l1,l2,l3,l4,l5be a set of softwares which perform certain jobs. One of these is required to enhance the production of a company. In order to purchase a software the companey consider the parameters setE=e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6,e7, wheree1;pricee2;programing environmente3;user friendlye4;backup and updatese5;compatibility with existing systemse6;developers good wille7;size and featuresTo select a suitable software, an order among the parameters will be considered. This order is shown in Fig. 3. The company assigns this duty to a team of two specialists. The first member of the team is from accounts department and considers the set of parametersA=e1,e3,e4,e6and the other is from computer department and takes the care of the set of parametersB=e2,e5,e7. Here sets A and B also have the order inherited from E. LetF,AandG,Bbe lattice ordered soft sets determined by the members of the team to select the suitable software. These lattice ordered soft sets are shown in Tables 7 and 8.Opinion of both members carry equal weights. Combination of both opinion will help to select the suitable software for the company. In order to get a unanimous decisionF,A∩∧G,Bis a lattice ordered soft set and may be a suitable choice. NowF,A∩∧G,B=H,C, is shown in Table 9.C=e1∧e2,e1∧e5,e1∧e7,e3∧e2,e3∧e5,e3∧e7,e4∧e2,e4∧e5,e4∧e7,e6∧e2,e6∧e5,e6∧e7where C=A⊗B and order on set C is ≲.Table 10 gives sum of membership for all the softwares for all the parameters involved inF,A∩∧G,B.Now the selection of software will be judged by minimum number of zeros for each software in Table 9 and maximum membership grades in Table hyperlinktab1010. Thus the ranking of softwares is given by Table 11.Verification by TOPSISThe technique of order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is presented by Hwang and Yoon [9]. This technique has been applied to various problems successfully. Here this technique is being applied to verify the choice of software as seen in Example 5. Algorithm for this technique is presented in the following [6].1Construct a decision matrix for m-alternative and n-attributes.Normalize the decision matrix withrij=xij∑mi=1xij2for i = 1,2, …m and j= 1,2 …n. Where xijand rijare the original and normalized scores of decision matrix respectively.Construct the weighted normalized decision matrixvij=wjrij, wherewjis the weight for the j-attribute (criteria).Determine the positive ideal solutionsL*=v1*,v2*,.....vn*wherevi*={maxvjifj∈Jandminvjifj∈J′}and negative ideal solutionsL′=v1′,v2′,.....vn′wherevi′={minvjifj∈Jandmaxvjifj∈J′}.Find the separation measures for each alternative,Si+=∑j=1nvi*−vij212ideal separation where i=1,2...,m andSi−=∑j=1nvi′−vij212negative ideal separation where i=1,2,3....m.Find the relative closeness to the ideal solutionCi*=Si−Si−+Si+therefore0<Ci*<1. Select the alternative closest to 1.In order to verify the conclusion in Example 5, for optimal choice TOPSIS is being applied. First of all decision matrix for five alternatives and seven attributes is written in matrix 1Matrix 2 represents the Normalization of Matrix 10.50.44721359500.7071067810000.50.4472135950.70710678100.577350269010.50.4472135950.7071067810.70710678101000.447213595000.577350269000.50.447213595000.57735026900Matrix2As it is mentioned in Example 5, that all parameters carry equal weights therefore it can be considered the weight of each parameter is 1. So weighted normalized matrix is same as normalized matrix shown as matrix 2.Now the positive ideal solution L* isL*=0.707106781,1,1,0.577350269,0.577350269and the negative ideal solution L′ isL′=0,0,0,0,0.Separation measuresSi+andSi−are given in Tables 12 and 13FinallyCi*=Si−Si−+Si+is as in Table 14This shows that the ranking in top three cases by TOPSIS and the method given in Example 5, are same. Both methods shows that the minimum priority should be given to the l4.It should be noted that method presented in Example 5, is straight forward and very small effort is required there in comparison with TOPSIS. However extreme choices given by both methods are the same.
