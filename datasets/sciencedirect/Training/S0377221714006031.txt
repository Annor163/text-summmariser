@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we present a simple method for finding the extreme points of various types of incomplete attribute weights. Incomplete information about attribute weights is transformed by a sequence of change of variables to a set whose extreme points are readily found. This enhanced method fails to derive the extreme points of every type of incomplete attribute weights. Nevertheless, it provides us with a flexible method for finding the extreme points, including widely-used forms of incomplete attribute weights. Finally, incomplete attribute values, expressed in various forms, are also analyzed to find their characterizing extreme points by applying similar procedures carried out in the incomplete attribute weights.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems have been studied extensively over the past several decades. In general, most of studies are based on precise parameters of the problems by one of elaborate elicitation methods. Intermittently, however, attempts emerged to alleviate the burdens of specifying parameters due to the reasons of time pressure, lack of data and domain knowledge, limited attention and information processing capabilities and so on. Of course, prior (sophisticated) methodologies are advocated if a decision-maker is willing to or able to supply, with the help of decision analyst, all the information necessary to solve the MADM problems at hand.Many earlier studies on incomplete attribute weights are presented in the context of MADM (Ahn & Park, 2008; Eum, Park, & Kim, 2001; Kirkwood & Sarin, 1985; Lee, Park, & Kim, 2002; Mateos, Jiménez, & Ríos-Insua, 2006; Mateos, Jiménez, & Blanco, 2012; Mateos, Ríos-Insua, & Jiménez, 2007; Park, 2004; Puerto, Mármol, Monloy, & Fernandez, 2000). Examples of incomplete attribute weights are in the form of weak or strict rankings, difference rankings, and fixed or ratio bounds. The incomplete information about values could occur in practice as well. For a qualitative attribute, a decision-maker may say an alternative is best (100%), and another is in the level between 80% and 90% relative to the level of the first one (Ahn, Park, Han, & Kim, 2000; Kim & Ahn, 1999). This can be expressed in the form of ratio bounds.To solve MADM problems whose elements are incompletely known, we rely on one of two approaches: a linear programming (LP) approach and an extreme point approach. The former attempts to formulate and then solve the problems which are constrained by incomplete attribute weights. The extreme point approach, on the other hand, tries to find the extreme points characterizing the incomplete attribute weights (Mármol, Puerto, & Fernandez, 1998; Mármol, Puerto, & Fernandez, 2002; Puerto et al., 2000; Solymosi & Dombi, 1986). Once they are found, dominance relations between alternatives are established by simply multiplying extreme points of incomplete attribute weights by performance evaluations of alternatives in the case that only the attribute weights are incomplete (see also Section 3 for the case of incomplete attribute weights and values). It seems that the extreme point approach can be better used to test dominance only if they are easily and completely identified. To this end, Puerto et al. (2000) presented some formulas to find the extreme points of widely-used incomplete attribute weights. For more details, please also refer to the papers (Mármol et al., 1998; Mármol et al., 2002; Puerto et al., 2000; Shepetukha & Olson, 2001).In this paper, we present a simple method for finding the extreme points of incomplete attribute weights by the change of variables, which has some merits as follows. First of all, the proposed method is easy to apply but the results are equivalent to those of Puerto et al. (2000). The method rather encompasses a type of incomplete information such as multi-levels of preference differences (Section 2.5). Second, the proposed method is readily extendable to cover other types of incomplete attribute weights beyond the ones mentioned in the paper. An example is illustrated at the end of Section 2. Moreover, the change of variable technique can be effectively used to address bounded descriptions. Finally, incomplete attribute values, expressed in various forms, are also analyzed to find their characterizing extreme points by applying similar procedures carried out in the incomplete attribute weights. These findings complete a study on the extreme point-based MADM under incomplete information. A practical use of extreme points of strict preferences in Section 3.1, for example, is to represent judgments induced by the rank order. Thus we can analyze a qualitative multi-criteria decision-making problem where each alternative is assigned a rank position and multiple criteria are ordinally ranked in terms of relative importance in a slightly different context with Cook and Kress (1996).The paper is comprised of two main sections. Sections 2 and 3 describe how to find the extreme points of incomplete attribute weights and values respectively. A numerical example is illustrated in Section 4, followed by concluding remarks in Section 5.In MADM problems, one usually considers a finite discrete set of alternatives A={x1, x2, …, xm}, which is valued by a finite discrete set of attributes C={c1, c2, …, ck} where m is the number of alternatives and k the number of attributes. We assume an additive model, which is considered a valid approximation in most real decision-making problems (Stewart, 1996), and is widely used within multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) (Keeney & Raiffa, 1993; von Winterfeldt & Edwards, 1986),V(xi)=∑j=1kλjvj(xij)where V(xi) is the overall multi-attribute value of alternative xiwith attribute levels(xi1,…,xik),0⩽V(xi)⩽1,i=1,…,m; λjis a weighting coefficient such that∑j=1kλj=1,λj⩾0,j=1,…,k; vj(·) is a single attribute value of alternatives with respect to jth attribute, j=1, …, k, 0⩽vj(·)⩽1.Let Λ denote a set of incomplete attribute weights and Vja set of outcomes on the jth attribute, that is, the values of vj(·) for alternatives such that Vj={vj(x1j), vj(x2j), …, vj(xmj)}. According to pairwise dominance, alternative xpdominates xqif for any fixed set of feasible weights the worst outcome in xpat least exceeds the best outcome in xq(Salo & Hämäläinen, 1992; Weber, 1987). Specifically, alternative xpis at least preferred to xqif and only if PD(xp, xq)⩾0 where(1)PD(xp,xq)=min∑j=1kλjδjxp,xqλj∈Λ,δjxp,xq=minvjxpj-vjxqjvj∈Vj.In the paper, we assume that the importance of attributes is specified by one of various types of incomplete attribute weights, which are listed in accordance with the development by Puerto et al. (2000): (a) lower bounds on the weighting coefficients, (b) rank ordered attributes, (c) ratio scale inequalities among attributes, and (d) rank ordered attributes with discriminating factors. In addition to these incomplete attribute weights, we append (e) multi-levels of preference differences,1Some authors refer to it as ordered metric (Kmietowicz & Pearman, 1982; Pearman, 1993).1which can be subsequently constructed based on the rank ordered attributes. See also the paper for extensive examples of incomplete attribute weights by Park (2004). Given these incomplete attribute weights, the proposed method attempts to find all extreme points for each case by the change of variables.A set of lower bounds on the weighting coefficients is denoted by ΛLB:ΛLB=λ:λj⩾αj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kλj=1where∑j=1kαj⩽1.If the sum of lower bounds equals to one, say∑j=1kαj=1, we find only one valid extreme pointλ=(α1, α2, …, αk). Otherwise, we make the change of variables μj=λj−αj⩾0, j=1, …, k, which consequently leads to a set MLB in terms of μj, noting that the sum to unity constraint∑j=1kλj=1is transformed into∑j=1kμj=1-∑j=1kαj>0:MLB=μ:μj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kμj=1-∑j=1kαj>0.If we make a further change of variablesγj=μj/(1-∑j=1kαj),j=1,…,k, the set MLB is equivalently transformed to ΓLB in terms of γj:ΓLB=γ:γj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kγj=1.Then we easily find the extreme points of ΓLB as an identity matrix I=(e1, e2, …, ek) where ejis a unit column vector whose jth element is one and zero elsewhere. To find the extreme points in terms of λj, which is our final goal, we multiply each ejby a scalar(1-∑j=1kαj)to maintainμj=(1-∑j=1kαj)γj, thus yielding(1-∑j=1kαj)ejand then we add a column vectorα=(α1, α2, …, αk)′ to each(1-∑j=1kαj)ejto maintain λj=μj+αj. These operations finally produce the extreme points as follows:λ1=1-∑j=1,j≠1kαj,α2,…,αk,λ2=α1,1-∑j=1,j≠2kαj,α3,…,αk,…,λk-1=α1,…,αk-2,1-∑j=1,j≠k-1kαj,αk,λk=α1,…,αk-1,1-∑j=1,j≠kkαj.A set of rank ordered attributes, which is one of the most widely used types of incomplete attribute weights, is denoted by ΛRO:ΛRO=λ:λ1⩾λ2⩾⋯⩾λk⩾0,∑j=1kλj=1.To start with, we introduce new variablesμ=(μ1, μ2, …, μk) to denote μj=λj−λj+1⩾0, j=1, …, k−1, μk=λk⩾0 and rearrange them to obtain λk=μk, λk−1=μk−1+μk, λk−2=μk−2+μk−1+μk, …, λ1=μ1+μ2+⋯+μk, noting that∑j=1kλj=∑j=1kj·μj=1. These substitutions consequently lead to an equivalent set MRO in terms of μj:MRO=μ:μj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kj·μj=1.We now make a further change of variables γj=j·μj, j=1, …, k to transform MRO into ΓRO, which enable us to obtain a set of extreme points with easeΓRO=γ:γj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kγj=1.As before, starting with I=(e1, e2, …, ek), we multiply each ejby a scalar 1/j to preserve μj=γj/j, thus yielding1jej, j=1, …, k. For a givenμj=0,…,0,1j︸jth,0,…,0, we obtainλj=1j,…,1j︸j,0,…,0by solving a set of equationsλj=∑m=jkμm,j=1,…,k. Continuing in this manner for allμj, we find a set of extreme points in terms of λj:λ1=1,0,0,…,0,λ2=12,12,0,…,0,…,λk-1=1k-1,1k-1,1k-1,…,1k-1,0,λk=1k,1k,1k,…,1k. See also other proofs (Carrizosa, Conde, Fernandez, & Puerto, 1995; Claessens, Lootsma, & Vogt, 1991; Sarin, 1978).We denote a set of ratio scale inequalities among attributes by ΛRSI:ΛRSI=λ:λ1⩾α1λ2,…,λk-1⩾αk-1λk,λk⩾0,∑j=1kλj=1.Similarly to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we make the change of variables μj=λj−αjλj+1⩾0, j=1, …, k−1, μk=λk⩾0, yielding a set of equations:(2)λk=μkλk-1=μk-1+αk-1μkλk-2=μk-2+αk-2μk-1+αk-2αk-1μk⋯λ2=μ2+α2μ3+⋯+α2⋯αk-1μk,λ1=μ1+α1μ2+α1α2μ3+⋯+α1α2⋯αk-1μk,which adds to∑j=1kλj=∑j=1kβjμj=1where β1=1, β2=1+α1, β3=(1+α2+α1α2), …, βk=(1+αk−1+αk−2αk−1+⋯+α1α2⋯αk−1). Thus the resulting set MRSI will beMRSI=μ:μj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kβjμj=1.The set MRSI is further transformed to ΓRSI by the change of variables γj=βjμj, j=1, …, k:ΓRSI=γ:γj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kγj=1.Starting with the extreme points of ΓRSI, we multiply a scalar 1/βjto each ejto preserve μj=γj/βj, which yields1βjej,j=1,…,kand then solve a set of equations μj=λj−αjλj+1⩾0, j=1, …, k−1 and μk=λkrecursively. To illustrate, for a givenμj=0,…,0,1βj︸jth,0,…,0, we obtainλj=α1α2⋯αj-1βj,…,αj-1βj,1βj︸j,0,…,0by solving a set of Eq. (2). These operations for allμjresult in a set of extreme points in terms of λj:λ1=1,0,…,0,λ2=α1β2,1β2,0,…,0,λ3=α1α2β3,α2β3,1β3,0,…,0,…,λk-1=α1α2⋯αk-2βk-1,α2⋯αk-2βk-1,…,αk-2βk-1,1βk-1,0,λk=α1α2⋯αk-1βk,α2⋯αk-1βk,…,αk-1βk,1βk.If we set αj=1 for all j, ΛRSI simply reduces to ΛRO and its extreme points are identical to those of rank ordered attributes in Section 2.2.We denote a set of rank ordered attributes with discriminating factors by ΛROD:ΛROD=λ:λj-λj+1⩾εj,j=1,…,k-1,λk⩾εk,∑j=1kλj=1.Note that if εj=0 for all j, ΛROD simply reduces to a set of rank ordered attributes in Section 2.2. Similarly to the rank ordered attributes, we make the change of variables μj=λj−λj+1−εj⩾0, j=1, …, k−1, μk=λk−εk⩾0 and rewrite them to obtain a set of equations:(3)λk=μk+εkλk-1=μk-1+μk+εk+εk-1⋯λ1=∑j=1kμj+∑j=1kεjwhich adds to∑j=1kλj=∑j=1kj·μj+∑j=1kj·εj=1. As a result, the weighting set ΛROD is transformed to MRODMROD=μ:μj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kj·μj=1-∑j=1kj·εj.If∑j=1kj·εj>1,MRODand thus ΛROD are infeasible (of course, if∑j=1kεj⩾1in ΛROD, it will be also infeasible). To show this more clearly, let us equate λj−λj+1=εj, j=1, …, k−1 and λk=εk. Then we obtain a set of equationsλj=∑m=jkεm,j=1,…,kand further∑j=1kλj=∑j=1kj·εj. If εj=ε for all j, ε is allowed to have a maximum of2k(k+1)so that ΛROD is feasible.We make a further change of variables γj=βj·μjwhereβj=j/(1-∑j=1kj·εj)to obtain ΓRODΓROD=γ:γj⩾0,j=1,…,k,∑j=1kγj=1.Based on a set of extreme points of ΓROD, say I=(e1, e2, …, ek), we multiply each ejby a scalar 1/βjto obtain1βjej,j=1,…,k. The substitution of known μjto the set of Eq. (3) yields the extreme points in terms of λj:λ1=(1-t+t1),t2,…,tk-1,tk,λ2=121-t+t1,121-t+t2,t3,…,tk-1,tk⋯λk-1=1k-11-t+t1,1k-11-t+t2,…,1k-11-t+tk-1,tkλk=1k1-t+t1,1k1-t+t2,…,1k1-t+tk-1,1k1-t+tkwheret=∑j=1kj·εjandtj=∑m=jkεm.If ∊j=∊ for all j, the jth extreme pointλjsimply reduces to1j1-kk+12∊+k∊,1j1-kk+12∊+k-1∊,…,1j1-kk+12∊+k-j+1∊,︸jk-j∊,k-j-1∊,…,∊.To test dominance will have a parametric representation involving ∊. Therefore we can obtain different levels of prioritization of alternatives depending on ∊. If the values ∊jare in decreasing order such as ∊1>∊2>⋯>∊k>0, this is a case when a decision-maker intends to discriminate more on the difference of higher rankings than that of lower rankings. For example if we simply let∊j=110j,j=1,…,k, we can prioritize alternatives by considering dissimilar levels of intensity about differences of the attributes weights.We consider a set of multi-levels of preference differences in addition to the incomplete attribute weights in Sections 2.1,2.2,2.3 and 2.42The subscripts inΛPDare arranged in ascending order for convenience.2:ΛPD=λ:λ1-λ2⩾λ2-λ3⩾⋯⩾λk-1-λk,λk⩾0,∑j=1kλj=1.To start with, we make the change of variables μj=λj−λj+1⩾0, j=1, …, k−1, μk=λk⩾0, which transforms the set ΛPD to MPD, noting that∑j=1kλj=∑j=1kjμj=1.MPD=μ:μ1⩾μ2⩾⋯⩾μk⩾0,∑j=1kjμj=1.A further change of variables γj=jμj, j=1, …, k leads to ΓPD as shown belowΓPD=γ:γ1⩾12γ2⩾13γ3⩾⋯⩾1kγk,∑j=1kγj=1.The set ΓPD is a special case of ratio scale inequalities among attributes in Section 2.3 whereα1=12,α2=23,α3=34,…,αk-1=k-1k. Therefore, we can easily find the extreme points of ΓPD asγ1=(1,0,…,0),γ2=13,23,0,…,0,γ3=16,26,36,0,…,0,…,γk=2k(k+1),4k(k+1),…,2(k-1)k(k+1),2kk(k+1), usingβ1=1,β2=32,β3=63, …,βk=k+12.To find the extreme points in terms of λj, we multiply a scalar 1/l, l=1, …, k to each element in γjto maintain μj=γj/j, which gives usμj=2jj+1,2jj+1,…,2jj+1︸j,0,…,0,j=1,…,k.Then we solve a set of equations μj=λj−λj+1, j=1, …, k−1, μk=λkto obtainλ1=(1,0,…,0,0),λ2=23,13,0,…,0,0,λ3=36,26,16,0,…,0,0,…,λk-1=2(k-1)(k-1)k,2(k-2)(k-1)k,…,2(k-1)k,0,λk=2kk(k+1),2(k-1)k(k+1),…,4k(k+1),2k(k+1).For a quick reference, we summarize the extreme points for each case in Table 1.Example: This is a new case which was not dealt in the previous sections, intended to show the use of the change of variables in other forms of incomplete attribute weights. Let us assume that incomplete attribute weights are specified such that an attribute is sequentially at least as important as the sum of the remaining ones:Λ=λ:λ1⩾λ2+λ3+λ4,λ2⩾λ3+λ4,λ3⩾λ4⩾0,∑j=14λj=1.To start with, we make the change of variablesμj=λj-∑m=j+14λm,j=1,2,3and μ4=λ4 to obtainM={μ:μj⩾0,j=1,…,4,μ1+2μ2+4μ3+8μ4=1}.We make a further change of variables γ1=μ1, γ2=2μ2, γ3=4μ3, and γ4=8μ4 to obtainΓ=γ:γj⩾0,j=1,…,4,∑j=14γj=1.Starting with ej, j=1, …, 4 of Γ, we convert them into a set of vectors in terms ofμj,(1,0,0,0),0,12,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,18and then into the extreme points in terms of λj, which is our final goal. To illustrate, for a givenμ4=0,0,0,18, we obtainλ4=48,28,18,18by solving a set of equations:μ4=λ4=18μ3=λ3-λ4=0μ2=λ2-λ3+λ4=0μ1=λ1-λ2+λ3+λ4=0.These operations for allμjfinally produce the extreme points as follows:λ1=(1, 0, 0, 0) for a vector (1, 0, 0, 0),λ2=12,12,0,0for0,12,0,0,λ3=24,14,14,0for0,0,14,0, andλ4=48,28,18,18for0,0,0,18.We have shown in Section 2 that the change of variable technique can be successfully used to find the extreme points of incomplete attribute weights. This idea can also be applied to incomplete attribute values including (a) strict preferences, (b) weak preferences, (c) weak differences of preference, and (d) ratio preferences. Refer to the paper by Park (2004) for an extensive survey of incomplete attribute values. Once all extreme points are found, the pairwise dominance in (1) is slightly modified to take into account the extreme points of incomplete attribute values:(4)PD(xp,xq)=mini∑j=1kλijδjxp,xqδjxp,xq=minkρjk(xp)-ρjk(xq)where λijis the jth entry of the ith extreme pointλiof the attribute weights, and ρjk(xp) and ρjk(xq) denote the entries in the kth extreme point of alternatives xpand xqfor the jth attribute. To test dominance no longer requires solving LPs even though the attribute weights or values are incompletely specified.In what follows, we will introduce how to find the extreme points of incomplete attribute values.The strict preferences between alternatives for the jth attribute are encoded in the form of Vj(SP)3With no loss of generality, we designate vj(x1)=1 and vj(xm)=0 in a set of incomplete attribute values that will follow. Further we simply denote vj(xij) as vj(xi) and vj(xi+1·j) as vj(xi+1).3:Vj(SP)={1⩾vj(xi)-vjxi+1⩾εi>0,i=1,…,m-1}.To begin with, we introduce new variables qito denote qi=vj(xi)−vj(xi+1), i=1, …, m−1 and qm=vj(xm)=0. These substitutions lead to an equivalent setVj′(SP)in terms of qiVj′(SP)=1⩾qi⩾εi>0,i=1,…,m-1,qm=0,∑i=1mqi=1.The setVj′(SP)is equivalent to ΛLB in Section 2.1 except qm. Thus, instead of repeatedly making the change of variables, we use the results derived in Section 2.1, say q1=(1−t1+ε1, ε2, …, εm−1, 0), q2=(ε1, 1−t1+ε2, ε3, …, εm−1, 0), …, qm−1=(ε1, ε2, …, εm−2, 1−t1+εm−1, 0) wheretj=∑k=jm-1∊k,j=1,…,m-1. Then, for each qi, we can find the extreme points of Vj( SP). To illustrate, for a given qm−1 we obtain vj(xm)=0, vj(xm−1)=1−t1+εm−1, vj(xm−2)=1−t1+εm−1+εm−2, …, vj(x2)=1+t2−t1, vj(x1)=1 by sequentially solving a set of equations:qm=vj(xm)=0qm-1=vj(xm-1)-vj(xm)=1-t1+εm-1qm-2=vj(xm-2)-vjxm-1=εm-2⋯q1=vj(x1)-vjx2=ε1Continuing in this manner for all qi, we obtain a set of extreme points in terms of vj: v1=(1, t2, t3, …, tm−1, 0), v2=(1, 1+t2−t1, t3, …, tm−1, 0), v3=(1, 1+t2−t1, 1+t3−t1, t4, …, tm−1, 0), …, vm−1=(1, 1+t2−t1, …, 1+tm−1−t1, 0).A set of strict preferences simply reduces to a set of weak preferences Vj(WP) if εi=0 for all i in Vj(SP):Vj(WP)=1⩾vj(x1)⩾vj(x2)⩾⋯⩾vj(xm)⩾0.Accordingly, the extreme points of Vj(WP) can be readily found by applying tj=0 for all j to the extreme points of Vj(SP): v1=(1, 0, 0, …, 0), v2=(1, 1, 0, …, 0), …, vm−1=(1, 1, …, 1, 0) (Sarabando & Dias, 2010).We denote a set of weak differences of preference between alternatives by Vj(DP):Vj(DP)={1⩾vj(x1)-vj(x2)⩾⋯⩾vj(xm-1)-vj(xm)⩾vj(xm)⩾0}.The set Vj(DP) is transformed toVj′(DP)by the change of variables qi=vj(xi)−vj(xi+1), i=1, …, m−1 and qm=vj(xm)=0 as beforeVj′(DP)=1⩾q1⩾q2⩾⋯⩾qm-1⩾0,qm=0,∑i=1mqi=1.Its extreme points are equivalent to those of rank ordered attributes in Section 2.2, sayq1=(1,0,0,…,0),q2=12,12,0,…,0, …,qm-1=1m-1,1m-1,…,1m-1,0. With each qi, i=1, …, m−1, we can find the extreme points in terms of vj. To illustrate, for a given qm−1 we obtain vj(xm)=0,vj(xm-1)=1m-1,vj(xm-2)=2m-1,…,vj(x2)=m-2m-1, vj(x1)=1 by solving a set of equations:qm=vj(xm)=0qm-1=vj(xm-1)-vj(xm)=1m-1⋯q2=vj(x2)-vjx3=1m-1q1=vj(x1)-vj(x2)=1m-1.Continuing in this manner for all qi, we obtain a set of extreme points in terms of vj: v1=(1, 0, …, 0, 0),v2=1,12,0,…,0,…,vm-2=1,m-3m-2,…,1m-2,0,0,vm-1=1,m-2m-1,…,1m-1,0.The incomplete attribute values, expressed by ratio preferences, are denoted by Vj(RP):Vj(RP)={1⩾vj(xi)⩾αivjxi+1>0,i=1,…,m-1}.Equivalently,Vj(RP)={1⩾vj(x1)⩾α1vj(x2)⩾α1α2vjx3⩾⋯⩾α1α2⋯αm-1vj(xm)}.The use of variables qisuch that(5)q1=vj(x1)-α1vj(x2)andqi=∏k=1i-1αkvj(xi)-∏k=1iαkvjxi+1,i=2,…,m-1leads to a setVj′(RP)Vj′(RP)=1⩾qi⩾0,i=1,…,m-1,qm=0,∑i=1mqi=1.Starting from each ei, we solve, using known qi, the set of Eq. (5) recursively to find the extreme points in terms of vj. To illustrate, for a given em−1=(0, …, 0, 1, 0) we findvj(xm)=0,vj(xm-1)=1α1α2⋯αm-2,vj(xm-2)=1α1α2⋯αm-3,…,vj(x2)=1α1,vj(x1)=1by solving a set of equations:qm=α1α2⋯αm-1vj(xm)=0qm-1=α1α2⋯αm-2vj(xm-1)-α1α2⋯αm-1vj(xm)=1qm-2=α1α2⋯αm-3vj(xm-2)-α1α2⋯αm-2vj(xm-1)=0⋯q2=α1vj(x2)-α1α2vjx3=0q1=vj(x1)-α1vj(x2)=0.Continuing in this manner for all ei, we obtain a set of extreme points in terms of vj: v1=(1, 0, 0, …, 0),v2=1,1α1,0,…,0,v3=1,1α1,1α1α2,0,…,0, …,vm-1=1,1α1,1α1α2,…,1α1α2⋯αm-2,0.For a quick reference, we summarize the extreme points for each case in Table 2and schematically depict in Fig. 1the types of change of variables applied in Sections 2 and 3.Consider an example with four alternatives {x1, …, x4}, which are valued by three attributes, {c1, c2, c3} as shown in Table 3(Lee, Park, Eum, & Park, 2001).For the first two attributes, the values of all alternatives are represented in the form of bounded descriptions, for example, v1 (x1)=1, 0.6⩽v1(x2)⩽0.7, 0.4⩽v1(x3)⩽0.5, and v1(x4)=0. The values for attribute c3 represent ordinal relations. Specifically, we regard these orders as strict rankings such that v3(x3)=1, v3(x3)−v3(x2)⩾∊32, v3(x2)−v3(x1)⩾∊21, v3(x1)−v3(x4)⩾∊14, v3(x4)=0 with all ∊ijassumed, for simplicity, to be a value at 0.1.Further, suppose that we have incomplete information about attribute weights such that4The ratio bounds are equivalently transformed to710⩽A⩽810,106⩽B≤105,58⩽C⩽67,A·B·C=1whereA=λ2λ1,B=λ1λ3,C=λ3λ2. If we take a logarithm for each variable and then make the change of variables, we can find the extreme points of ratio bounds such thatλ1=512,412,312,λ2=1023,823,523,λ3=1023,723,623,andλ4=1022,722,522.40.7⩽λ2/λ1⩽0.8,0.5⩽λ3/λ1⩽0.6.These are relative to the value of λ1 to be regarded as the most important attribute. With these incomplete attribute weights and values, we find their extreme points with help of the results in the previous sections and list them in Table 4.Now we describe a procedure for establishing pairwise dominance relations between alternatives x1 and xk, k=2, 3, 4. For each attribute, we compute the minimum of value differences (i.e., differences of extreme points) δj(x1, xk) for k=2, 3, 4, using Table 4, which results in310810-810510-210-9101010110110.The dominance tests proceed to determine PD(x1, xk), k=2, 3, 4: (a) multiplying the values δj(x1, xk) by the extreme points of attribute weights and (b) selecting the minimum value as indicated by Eq. (4)PDx1,x2PDx1,x3PDx1,x4=38230-1012057120.The positive values of PD(x1, x2) and PD(x1, x4) show that alternative x1 dominates alternatives x2 and x4 respectively. It should be noted that a negative value ofPD(x1,x3)=-10120does not imply the dominance of x3 over x1 and therefore we have to test dominance between x3 and x1. It proves that no dominance relation exists between x1 and x3 because ofPDx3,x1=-43220. In this manner, we test dominance for other pairs of alternatives and finally obtain a set of nondominated alternatives {x1, x3}.In the paper, we present a simple method for finding the extreme points of incomplete attribute weights and values. The change of variable technique is commonly used to attain such a goal. Even though it fails to find the extreme points of every type of incomplete preference data, it provides us with a flexible method for identifying them. The identified extreme points are then used to see if a certain alternative is potentially optimal or to establish dominance between alternatives.The problem inherent in decision-making with incomplete information is that one frequently encounters more than a single nondominated alternative even when attribute weights are to be incompletely known, not to mention incomplete attribute values. A further refinement of the attribute weights may continue in order to obtain a desired number of nondominated alternatives. If this effort turns out to be unsuccessful or encounters a deadlock, the approximate weights as one of decision criteria (Jiménez, Mateos, & Sabio, 2013; Mateos et al., 2007) can be considered and derived by using the extreme points of the incomplete attribute weights. The centroid weights as approximate weights can be determined by coordinate-wise averaging of the extreme points, which are known to be ones minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the extreme points.
