@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To date, comparative statics effects analyzed in the context of expected utility depend on the decision-maker’s utility function. This paper presents a methodology that allows comparative statics effects to be obtained independent of the utility function for a general family of problems. In other words, we provide a set of conditions under which all decision-makers act the same way. Such a methodology can be applied to relevant problems in the related literature, such as the portfolio choice and the competitive firm under price uncertainty (with or without the existence of a forward/futures market). With regards to such specific cases, we show and analyze the most relevant effects produced by the variation of two or more parameters, regardless of the decision-maker’s preferences and attitude towards risk. Some of these effects are illustrated numerically.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the literature on decision-making there are several authors who model choice under risk by relying on the assumption of expected utility (EU) maximization. Amongst these authors, we can cite the seminal papers by Arrow (1963; 1965; 1971), on the optimal portfolio composition; Sandmo (1971), on the production-related decisions made by the competitive firm under uncertainty; and Feder (1977), on the problem of hiring under uncertainty. In Lippman and McCall (1981), we can find a good sample of classic models based on this same assumption. We can also cite more recent works such as those by Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) and Sévi (2010) on the single-period newsvendor problem; Choi and Ruszczyński (2011), on the multi-product newsvendor problem; Müller (2000), on the optimal stopping problem; Dalal and Alghalith (2009), on the firm under multiple uncertainty sources; Alghalith (2010), on methodological studies; Andersen and Nielsen (2013), on sports economics; and Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014), on optimal allocation.One of the studies that can be conducted on the above-mentioned models is the comparative statics analysis. This method, proposed by Samuelson (1941), may be approached in a simplified way (for one variable) by considering an unknown variable x whose equilibrium value is to be determined for preassigned values of a parameter y. We assume the following continuously differentiable implicit relation involving the unknown variable and the parameter:(1)ϕ(x,y)=0.If, for a given value ofy=y0,there exists a solution x* to (1), and if ϕx(x*, y0) ≠ 0, then by the implicit-function theorem11The implicit-function theorem for one dependent variable and one equation can be seen, for instance, in Theorem 3.2.1 in Krantz and Parks (2013).there exists a continuously differentiable function ψ in a sufficiently small neighborhood I of y0 such thatx*=ψ(y0)andϕ(ψ(y),y)=0for all y ∈ I. In the comparative statics analysis, the objective is to determine the sign of:(2)dx*dy=ψ′(y0),which is the instantaneous rate of change of x* with respect to y0. Thus, if the sign is positive, then this means that if an infinitesimally small change in the parameter y occurs starting from its initial value y0, then an increase in the equilibrium value of x* will also occur. Conversely, if the sign is negative, then an infinitesimally small change in y will produce a reduction in x*. Moreover, (2) represents a quantitative approximation of the variation produced, and the smaller the variation in the parameter, the more accurate the approximation would be.In the EU models, the derivative that results in (2) depends on the decision-maker’s utility function. Thanks to the Arrow–Pratt measure (Arrow, 1965 and Pratt, 1964), this fact allows the analysis to be performed according to the different types of risk behavior. Nevertheless, due to this dependency on the utility function, the analysis is usually approached from a qualitative perspective, i.e., the study focuses on obtaining the sign of the derivative rather than the variation magnitude. In addition, dependency on the utility function, which is absolutely essential for the theoretical analysis of the model, makes it difficult for the model to be applied to empirical studies. The reason for this difficulty is that it becomes necessary to make a number of assumptions related to the decision-maker’s utility function, such as the type of function and the parameters involved. Although, in practice, different types of functions have been used, the majority of authors tend to use a decision-maker with a utility function that exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), as stated by Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1965). The most frequently used set of functions in the literature is that of the power utility functions, which exhibits DARA and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). However, even if we assume a utility function of this type, it is still necessary to make assumptions on the parameter involved (the degree of relative risk aversion). Certain authors, such as Arrow (1971), Friend and Blume (1975), Hansen and Singleton (1982; 1984), Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Brown and Gibbons (1985), have made estimations of this parameter and have obtained different ranges for each case (a summary of some of these results, and others, can be seen in Aït-Sahalia & Lo, 2000). To avoid the problem of implementation of the utility function, other authors have used methods, such as mean-variance (MV) analysis, which is a good approximation of EU maximization (Markowitz, 2014).Thus, under the assumption of EU maximization, in general, it is difficult to measure the effect of the variation of a parameter because of its dependency on the utility function. Nevertheless, if the simultaneous variation of two parameters is considered, either this effect or the part of the effect depending on the utility function of one of the two parameters may be compensated by the presence of the other. Such research, which has yet to be conducted, would allow both theoretical and empirical conclusions to be obtained with no need to make any assumptions on the utility function and its parameters involved. In addition, not only would a qualitative assessment of the change in the equilibrium value be made possible, but also its quantitative assessment. In this paper, this analysis is performed by using a general model that includes a number of important models in the literature.The paper is structured as shown below. In Section 2, we show the comparative statics analysis that allows the effect of the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters to be studied. In Section 3, a general decision model under EU maximization is presented. In Section 4, we develop a methodology that allows us to attain comparative statics effects, which are independent of the utility function. In Section 5, we include a number of applications of the methodology used in three different models in the literature, and the most relevant effects attained are analyzed. In Section 6, we numerically illustrate some of these effects. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 7.In this section, the comparative statics analysis, formalized by Samuelson (1941) to study the effect produced on the equilibrium value due to the variation of one single parameter, is extended in order to study the effect of the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters.First, we assume the following continuously differentiable implicit relation involving an unknown variable x and n parameters(y1,…,yn):(3)ϕ(x,y1,…,yn)=0.If, for given values ofy1=y01,…,yn=y0n,there exists a solution x* to (3), and if ϕx(x*,y01,…,y0n) ≠ 0, then by the implicit-function theorem there exists a continuously differentiable function ψ in a sufficiently small neighborhood I of (y01,…,y0n) such thatx*=ψ(y01,…,y0n)andϕ(ψ(y1,…,yn),y1,…,yn)=0for all(y1,…,yn)∈I. Therefore, the total differential of x* is given by:(4)dx*=∂x*∂y1dy1+⋯+∂x*∂yndyn.Second, our goal now is to study the change in the value of x* that results when (y1,…,yn) varies from the initial position (y01,…,y0n) to a new position(y01+dy1,…,y0n+dyn),withdyi∈R(1 ≤ i ≤ n). This change is denoted by Δx*. That is:(5)Δx*=ψ(y01+dy1,…,y0n+dyn)−ψ(y01,…,y0n).It is known that, since ψ is differentiable, the following relationship between (4) and (5) exists:(6)Δx*=dx*+o(v),where we denotev≡(dy1,…,dyn)∈Rnand o(v) is an infinitesimal of a higher order than the norm of the vector of increments, ‖v‖. Therefore, by neglecting the second term in (6), the following linear approximation is obtained:(7)Δx*≈dx*.Therefore, when simultaneous changes occur in the parametersy1,…,yn,given bydy1,…,dyn,(4) represents an approximation of the total change occurring in x*. Thus, the objective in comparative statics under simultaneous changes in parameters becomes the determination of the sign and/or value of (4).In order to conduct a study that encompasses the largest number of models, we will adopt a general formulation of the problem similar to that proposed by Feder (1977). Let us consider an agent facing some type of risk modeled by a random variableZ=μ+σϵ,whereϵis a nondegenerate random variable withE[ϵ]=0andVar[ϵ]=1,so thatE[P]=μandVar[P]=σ2. This risk affects the agent’s future wealth, given by:(8)W(x)=f(x)Z−g(x),where f and g are (nonrandom) functions depending on a decision variable x, with fx≠ 0. In addition, f and g depend on an n-vector of parametersy=(y1,…,yn). In order to simplify, we use notations f(x) and g(x) instead off(x,y)andg(x,y). The agent must make a decision on the value of x, so as to maximize the EU for this future wealth.The agent’s attitude towards risk can be modeled by a Bernoulli utility function u, which is sufficiently regular (at least, of classC2), such that u′ ≠ 0 and u′′ ≠ 0. Thus, the agent’s goal is to solve:(9)maxxE[u(W(x))].The first-order condition is:(10)E[u′(W)(fx(x)Z−gx(x))]=0.If we assume that the second-order condition is verified so that there is an optimum x* for problem (9), then condition (10) evaluated at this optimum is equal to:(11)F(x*)=h(x*),where we denote h ≡ gx/fx, and:(12)F(x)≡E[u′(W(x))Z]E[u′(W(x))].From now on, we will use notation W* ≡ W(x*).In the literature, there are numerous models with this general structure, most of which are related to the field of the firm under uncertainty. The first model with this structure that we have found in this field is the seminal model proposed by Sandmo (1971). Since then, many authors have changed this model by considering, for instance, a source of uncertainty different from the price, such as the output (see Dalal & Alghalith, 2009) or the demand (see Leland, 1972 and Coes, 1977); or new decision-making variables, such as the firm’s hedge level (see Holthausen, 1979) or new parameters, such as the price of inputs (see Dalal, 1990). Other authors have considered that the firm’s goal is not to maximize its profit but to maximize the EU of income per worker (see Bughin, 1995; Feder, 1977; Hey, 1981; and Muzondo, 1979). Other models with this same structure exist in other areas of research, such as the portfolio choice, amongst which the seminal model by Arrow (1963; 1965; 1971) should be mentioned, and the portfolio model with tax rates by Diamond and Stiglitz (1974). Recently in the area of sports economics, Andersen and Nielsen (2013) have studied a specific model of firm under uncertainty. Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014) have also studied another specific model of a firm under uncertainty, in this case concerning the problem of optimal allocation.In the previous general problem, comparative statics can be studied according to each of the parameters yi(1 ≤ i ≤ n), μ and σ. For this purpose, we calculate the derivative of (12) with respect to both x and each of these parameters. The resulting derivatives are evaluated at the optimum:(13)Fx(x*)=fx(x*)S(14)Fyi(x*)={fyi(x*)S+(h(x*)fyi(x*)−gyi(x*))T,fyi(x*)≠0−gyiT,fyi(x*)=0(15)Fμ(x*)=1+f(x*)T(16)Fσ(x*)=h(x*)−μσ+f(x*)Sσ+(h(x*)−μ)f(x*)Tσwhere:S≡E[u′′(W*)(Z−h(x*))2]E[u′(W*)]T≡E[u′′(W*)(Z−h(x*))]E[u′(W*)].On the condition thatFx(x*)−hx(x*)≠022More specifically, this condition occurs if functions f and g satisfy fx> 0 and gx> 0, with f being concave and g being convex, and if function u verifies u′ > 0 and u′′ < 0 (which particularly implies that the agent is risk averse). Nevertheless, this is also verified ifgx=0,regardless of the sign of u′ and u′′., by applying the implicit-function theorem, we obtain the following from condition (11):∂x*∂ν=−Fν(x*)−hν(x*)Fx(x*)−hx(x*),where∂x*∂νdenotes∂x∂νevaluated at x*; for ν as any of the parameters yi, μ or σ of the model. Therefore, on considering derivatives (13)–(16), we obtain:(17)∂x*∂yi={−fyi(x*)fx(x*)+(gx(x*)fyi(x*)fx(x*)−gyi(x*))M+(hx(x*)fyi(x*)fx(x*)−hyi(x*))N,fyi(x*)≠0−gyi(x*)M−hyi(x*)N,fyi(x*)=0(18)∂x*∂μ=f(x*)M+N(19)∂x*∂σ=−f(x*)σfx(x*)+f(x*)h(x*)−μσM+1σ(h(x*)−μ+f(x*)hx(x*)fx(x*))Nwhere:M≡Thx(x*)−Fx(x*)N≡1hx(x*)−Fx(x*).Our aim now is to obtain an equation relating partial derivatives (17)–(19) as follows:(20)∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)≠0αi∂x*∂yi+∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)=0αi∂x*∂yi+αn+1∂x*∂μ+αn+2∂x*∂σ=β,with β,αk∈R(1≤k≤n+2). Thus, Eq. (20) may be considered as the total differential ofx*=x*(y,μ,σ).By replacing (17)–(19) in Eq. (20), the left-hand side of Eq. (20) can be grouped into three different addends: a first addend containing the factor M, a second addend containing the factor N, and a third addend containing neither of them. In order to ensure that Eq. (20) is independent of u, we impose that the first two addends are equal to zero and the third addend is equal to β, i.e.:(21){∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)≠0αi(gx(x*)fyi(x*)fx(x*)−gyi(x*))−∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)=0αigyi(x*)+αn+1f(x*)+αn+2f(x*)h(x*)−μσ=0∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)≠0αi(hx(x*)fyi(x*)fx(x*)−hyi(x*))−∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)=0αihyi(x*)+αn+1+αn+21σ(h(x*)−μ+f(x*)hx(x*)fx(x*))=0−∑1≤i≤nfyi(x*)≠0αifyi(x*)fx(x*)−αn+2f(x*)σfx(x*)=βSystem (21) can then be solved for variables αk(1≤k≤n+2). The solution we obtain (if any) is replaced in (20), which results in a general expression of a total differential equation of optimum x*, independent of the utility function. Finally, by identifying each αiobtained with its corresponding differential dyi, dμ or dσand by solving the resulting system, we obtain the following relationship between the change in the parameters and the total differential of x* (which is an approximation of the increment of x*):(22)dyiαi=dμαn+1=dσαn+2=dx*β(αk≠0,β≠0).If system (21) has infinitely many solutions, depending on the solution under consideration, a different equation will be obtained in (20). Forβ=0,expression (20) shows variations in the parameters for which the optimal solution remains invariant.The standard portfolio model consists of determining the optimal composition of the investor’s portfolio containing a risk-free and a risky asset. The risk-free asset has a rate of return r while the rate of return of the risky asset is given by a nondegenerate variableZ=μ+σϵ,where σ (σ > 0) is its standard deviation and μ is its expected value. The agent has an initial wealth given by q and his/her objective is to determine amounts x andq−x,to be invested into the risk-free asset and the risky asset, respectively.Under these conditions, the investor’s portfolio value by the end of the period under study is given by:(23)W(x)=x(1+r)+(q−x)(1+Z)=(q−x)Z+xr+q,and the aim is to maximize the EU of (23), i.e.:(24)maxxE[u(W(x))],where u is the investor’s Bernoulli utility function.The standard portfolio model is therefore a specific case of the general model proposed (8), where:f(x)=q−xandg(x)=−xr−q. By replacing the corresponding expressions of f, fx,fyi,gx,gyi,h, hxandhyiin (21) for this specific case, we obtain the following system (in which, given thatμ=rresults in a trivial case, we consider μ ≠ r and therefore x* ≠ q):(25){α1(1+r)+α2x*+α3(q−x*)+α4(q−x*)(r−μ)σ=0−α2+α3+α4r−μσ=0α1+α4q−x*σ=β,withβ∈R.By solving (25) for variables αk(1 ≤ k ≤ 4), the following relationship, which is independent of u, is derived:(26)α1∂x*∂q+α2∂x*∂r+α3∂x*∂μ+α4∂x*∂σ=βwhere:(27)α1=γα2=−γ1+rqα3=βμ−rq−x*−γ(1+μq−x*−x*(1+r)q(q−x*))α4=βσq−x*−γσq−x*withγ,β∈R.Depending on the various values of parameters γ and β to be considered, a different solution will be obtained in (27), resulting in a different expression in (26). In this section, we study the most significant solutions.1.If β ≠ 0 andγ=0,then we obtain:(28)(μ−r)∂x*∂μ+σ∂x*∂σ=q−x*.In (27),γ=0means that we assume that the wealth q of the agent and the rate of return r of the risk-free asset remain unchanged from the initial to the final situation. In addition, as β ≠ 0, we assume that the risky asset undergoes changes in both the expected value μ and the standard deviation σ.Proposition 1In the standard portfolio problem let us consider an agent which allocates a fixed budget q (q > 0) to a risk-free asset with rate of return r and a risky asset which varies from the initial to the final situation. LetZ0=μ0+σ0ϵbe the initial rate of return for the risky asset and letZ1=μ+σϵbe the new rate of return such thatZ1−r=(Z0−r)(1+δ),with δ ≠ 0. Thenx*=x0*+(q−x0*)δ+o(δ),wherex0*,x*are solutions to initial and new problems, correspondingly, and o(δ) is a function such thatlimδ→0o(δ)δ=0.Equation (28) evaluated in the initial situation is as follows:(29)(μ0−r)∂x*∂μ+σ0∂x*∂σ=q−x0*.So that the factors multiplying∂x*∂μand∂x*∂σcan approach zero infinitesimally, we multiply both sides of equation (29) by δ (δ ≠ 0), i.e.:(30)(μ0−r)δ∂x*∂μ+σ0δ∂x*∂σ=(q−x0*)δ.Therefore, (30) can be identified with the total differential ofx*=x*(μ,σ)in which:(31)dμ=(μ0−r)δ(32)dσ=σ0δ(33)dx*=(q−x0*)δ.Thus, if the variation occurring in μ0 and σ0 is such that (31) and (32) are verified, then the total differential dx* is given by (33). From (31) and (32) we obtain the following relationship:μ−μ0=(μ0−r)δandσ−σ0=σ0δ,or equivalently:(34)μ−r=(μ0−r)(1+δ)andσ=σ0(1+δ).Since we start from the initial variableZ0=μ0+σ0ϵ,this implies that variableϵremains invariant and thereforeZ1−r=(Z0−r)(1+δ). Therefore, as observed in Section 2, the increment of x* is given byx*−x0*=dx*+o(v),where o(v) is an infinitesimal of higher order than the length of the vector of incrementsv=(dμ,dσ); i.e.,lim(dμ,dσ)→(0,0)o(v)(dμ)2+(dσ)2=0. As σ0 > 0, then(μ0−r)2+σ02≠0; this limit being therefore equivalent tolimδ→0o(δ)δ=0in which, to simplify the notation, we denote o(δ) instead of o(v).□Under the conditions ofProposition 1, i.e.Z0=μ0+σ0ϵandZ1=μ+σϵwithZ1−r=(Z0−r)(1+δ)(or equivalently,μ−r=(μ0−r)(1+δ)andσ=σ0(1+δ),withϵremaining invariant), withδ∈Rclose to zero, then:(35)q−x*≈(q−x0*)(1−δ).Corollary 1 shows a linear approximation of the change inx0*when μ0 and σ0 vary in a specific way, withϵremaining invariant. Namely, when the excess returnZ0−r,as a random variable, increases (decreases) by the percentage δ, then the amount invested in the risky asset(q−x0*)decreases (increases) by approximately the same percentage, regardless of the investor’s preferences and attitude towards risk.Ifγ=β≠0,we obtain:(36)−q1+r∂x*∂q+∂x*∂r+∂x*∂μ=−q1+r.This means that from the initial to the final situation, it is assumed that the standard deviation of the risky asset remains invariant. Conversely, we assume there is a change in q, r and μ. As in the previous case, q0, r0 and μ0 denote the initial values, and q, r and μ denote the final values. By multiplying Eq. (36) evaluated at the initial moment by δ, and by identifyingdq=−q01+r0δ,dr=δ,dμ=δanddx*=−q01+r0δ,we obtain the following proposition.Proposition 2In the standard portfolio problem, let us consider an agent that allocates an initial budget q0(q0 > 0) to a risk-free asset and a risky asset, with initial rates of return r0andZ0=μ0+σϵ,respectively. Let q be the new budget and let r andZ1=μ+σϵbe the respective rates of return, such thatZ1−r=Z0−r0. Ifq=q0(1+δ)and1+r=(1+r0)(1−δ),for the same δ ≠ 0, thenx*=x0*−q01+r0δ+o(δ),wherex0*,x*are solutions to initial and new problems, correspondingly, and o(δ) is a function such thatlimδ→0o(δ)δ=0.Under the conditions ofProposition 2, i.e.Z0=μ0+σϵandZ1=μ+σϵwithZ1−r=Z0−r0(or equivalently,μ0−r0=μ−r,withϵand σ remaining invariant), ifq=q0(1+δ)and1+r=(1+r0)(1−δ),withδ∈Rclose to zero, then:(37)q−x*≈q0−x0*.Corollary 2 indicates that if the percentage decrease (increase) in1+r0coincides with the percentage increase (decrease) in q0, with the excess return(Z0−r0)remaining invariant as a random variable, then the amount invested in the risky asset(q0−x0*),approximately, will also remain invariant.Ifβ=0and γ ≠ 0, we obtain the following expression:(38)∂x*∂q−(1+r)q∂x*∂r−(1+μq−x*−x*(1+r)q(q−x*))∂x*∂μ−σq−x*∂x*∂σ=0.This involves the existence of some specific changes in the parameters under which the optimal amount remains roughly invariant for all agents, regardless of their utility function.We consider a firm that must make a decision on its level of output x before knowing the price for which the product will be sold on the market. This price is modeled by a random variable P defined byP=μ+σϵwith an expected value μ and standard deviation σ. The firm faces some fixed costs given by b, and some variable costs dependent on both the level of output and the prices of the inputs necessary for the output. In order to simplify, we will assume two inputs, at prices w1 and w2, and the variable cost function will be denoted c(x) instead of c(x, w1, w2).Under such conditions, the firm’s profits are given by:W(x)=Px−c(x)−b,and its aim is:maxxE[u(W(x))],where u is the firm’s Bernoulli utility function.This model is therefore a specific case of the general model proposed (8), where:f(x)=xandg(x)=c(x)+b. Therefore, system (21) obtained in this case is as follows:(39){−α1cw1(x*)−α2cw2(x*)−α3+α4x*+α5x*cx(x*)−μσ=0−α1cxw1(x*)−α2cxw2(x*)+α4+α51σ(x*cxx(x*)+cx(x*)−μ)=0−α5x*σ=β,withβ∈R.By solving (39) for variables αk(1 ≤ k ≤ 5), we obtain the following relationship, which is independent of u:(40)α1∂x*∂w1+α2∂x*∂w2+α3∂x*∂b+α4∂x*∂μ+α5∂x*∂σ=βwhere:(41)α1=γα2=δα3=βx*cxx(x*)−γ(cw1(x*)−xcxw1(x*))−δ(cw2(x*)−xcxw2(x*))α4=β(cxx(x*)+cx(x*)−μx*)+γcxw1(x*)+δcxw2(x*)α5=−βσx*withγ,δ,β∈R.By replacing valuesβ=0,γ=cxw2(x*)andδ=−cxw1(x*)in (41), from (40) we obtain the following relationship:(42)cxw2(x*)∂x*∂w1−cxw1(x*)∂x*∂w2+(cxw1(x*)cw2(x*)−cxw2(x*)cw1(x*))∂x*∂b=0.Thus, if there is a specific change in w1, w2 and b—the rest of the parameters remaining invariant—, the total differential is zero. From (42) we obtain the following proposition:Proposition 3In the problem of the firm under uncertainty, let us consider a firm facing some fixed costs given by b0, and some variable costs denoted by c(x), which depends on both the level of output and the prices w01and w02of the two inputs necessary for the output. If there is a small change in w01, w02and b0such that the new values w1, w2and b verifyw1−w01=cxw2(x0*)δ,w2−w02=cxw1(x0*)δandb−b0=Aδ(δ ≠ 0), whereA=cxw1(x0*)cw2(x0*)−cxw2(x0*)cw1(x0*), thenx*=x0*+o(δ), wherex0*,x*are solutions to initial and new problems, correspondingly, and o(δ) is a function such thatlimδ→0o(δ)δ=0.On the conditions ofProposition 3, ifb−b0=Aδ(δ∈R,close to zero) andw1−w01=cxw2(x0*)A(b−b0)w2−w02=cxw1(x0*)A(b−b0),then:x*≈x0*.Corollary 3 shows that, if there is a specific proportional relationship between the increase (decrease) in the prices of the inputs and the increase (decrease) in the firm’s fixed costs (the rest of parameters and variables of the model remain invariant), then the firm’s optimal level of output does not vary, regardless of the firm’s preferences and attitude towards risk.Holthausen (1979) analyzes the model of a competitive firm facing a stochastic market price P (of expected value μ and standard deviation σ) for its single output q. It can either sell its output at the random market price or sell it on a forward/futures market at a certain price b. Let x denote the amount of output hedged in the forward/futures market. Output is produced at a cost of c(q), with c′(q) > 0 and c′′(q) ≠ 0. Under this hypothesis, the firm’s profit is given by:W(q,x)=P(q−x)+bx−c(q),and its aim is to find the output and hedging levels that maximize the EU of its profit. That is, the objective is to calculate:max(q,x)E[u(W(q,x))],where u is the firm’s Bernoulli utility function. The problem then is the optimization of a function of two variables in the set ofR+×R.Although the Holthausen model has two decision-making variables and the general model (8) proposed has just one single variable, this fact does not impede the application of the methodology described, as we can see below:The first-order conditions necessary to obtain an interior solution for this optimization problem are as follows:(43)E[u′(W)(P−c′(q))]=0and(44)E[u′(W)(b−P)]=0.We will assume that the second-order sufficient condition is verified. In other words, there is an interior optimal solution (q*, x*) for the previous problem.It is known that, by operating with (43) and (44), we obtainc′(q)=b,i.e., the optimal level of output is the amount for which marginal cost equals forward/future price b. Therefore, in practice, the Holthausen model can be separated into two different problems. The first problem is independent of u, and consists of determining q* so that:(45)c′(q*)=b.The second problem consists—once q* is determined—of calculating x so that the EU of profit is maximized. From now on, we will consider q to be the firm’s optimal level of output by verifying (45), and the problem will be minimized as follows:maxxE[u(W(q,x))].We are therefore dealing with another specific case of (8), wheref(x)=q−xandg(x)=c(q)−bx,withq=q(b)anddq/db=1/c′′(q),according to the implicit-function theorem. System (21) obtained in this case is as follows:(46){α1x*+α2(q−x*)+α3(q−x*)(b−μ)σ=0−α1+α2+α3b−μσ=0α11c′′(q)+α3q−x*σ=β,withβ∈R.By solving (46) for variables αk, (1 ≤ k ≤ 3) we obtain the following relationship, which is independent of u:(47)α1∂x*∂b+α2∂x*∂μ+α3∂x*∂σ=βwhere:(48)α1=0α2=−βb−μq−x*α3=βσq−x*withβ∈R.For this model, we obtain only one non-trivial relationship (β ≠ 0) in (47), which is given by:(49)−(b−μ)∂x*∂μ+σ∂x*∂σ=q−x*.This is a relationship that considers variations in μ and σ but not in the other parameters. From (49) we obtain the following proposition by proceeding in a similar way to that in the previous models.Proposition 4In the problem of hedging and the firm under uncertainty let us consider a certain price b and an initial market priceP0=μ0+σ0ϵfor output q. LetP1=μ+σϵbe the new market price and let us consider that the other parameters remain invariant. IfP1−b=(P0−b)(1+δ),with δ ≠ 0, thenx*=x0*+(q−x0*)δ+o(δ),wherex0*,x*are solutions to initial and new problems, correspondingly, and o(δ) is a function such thatlimδ→0o(δ)δ=0.Under the conditions ofProposition 4, i.e.P0=μ0+σ0ϵandP1=μ+σϵwithP1−b=(P0−b)(1+δ)(or equivalently,μ−b=(μ0−b)(1+δ)andσ=σ0(1+δ),withϵremaining invariant), withδ∈Rclose to zero, then:q−x*≈(q−x0*)(1−δ).Corollary 4 shows that if μ0 and σ0 vary such that there is the same percentage variation inμ0−band σ0 whileϵremains invariant, then there is also the same variation inq−x0*but in the opposite direction. In other words, if the excess of the spot price (over the forward/future price), as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the firm will decrease (increase) the amount invested in the spot market by the same percentage, independent of the firm’s utility function.In this section, in order to illustrate the approximation of the optimal solution derived in this paper, we will conduct a simulation study. Since the models of a firm under uncertainty analyzed in this paper depend on a cost function for which a specific functional form should be assumed, in order to conduct this simulation study we will take the standard portfolio model, which is easier to implement. We will compare this approximation with two different cases that are also easy to carry out. In the first case, the agent exhibits constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) with utility functionu(t)=−e−kt(k > 0), and the probability distribution of random variable Z is normal. In the second case, the agent has a quadratic utility functionu(t)=t−bt2,so that he/she exhibits increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA).By operating as shown in Rodríguez-Puerta and Álvarez-López (2014), the optimal solution of (24) has the following exact expression in each of the two cases considered:3This expression is first found in Holthausen (1979), in the context of the firm under uncertainty.(50)CARAutilityandnormaldistribution:ThisexpressionisfirstfoundinHolthausen(1979),inthecontextofthefirmunderuncertainty.x*=q−μ−rσ2k.(51)Quadraticutility:x*=q−μ−r[σ2+(μ−r)2]ru(q(1+r))where rudenotes the Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion.We take the initial values for the parameters involved in the model asμ0=9.85,σ0=0.1,r0=9.75andq0=10000(in appropriate units); and we also take the values for the parameters involved in the CARA and quadratic utility functions ask=0.00137931035andb=4.589261129×10−6,respectively. The value of k considered is close to the value estimated by Buccola (1982). The value of b is adjusted such that the same initial solution is obtained in both cases.Under these conditions, the agent invests an optimal initial valuex0*of 2750 monetary units in the risk-free asset in the initial period. Let us also consider that, in a subsequent period, the percentage variation in the standard deviation of the risky asset with respect to the previous period equals the percentage variation in its expected return. Let δ denote this variation, i.e.,μ−r=(μ0−r)(1+δ)andσ=σ0(1+δ). Thus, according to (35), an approximation of the optimal value for the new period is given byx*=q−(q−x0*)(1−δ). Table 1shows this estimation according to the different values of δ as well as the error made in comparison with cases (50) and (51).Taking the same optimal initial value observed in the initial period, let us now assume that, in a subsequent period, the wealth the investor obtains for each of the monetary units invested in the risk-free asset increases by a percentage given by δ and his/her initial wealth decreases by the same percentage, i.e.,1+r=(1+r0)(1−δ)andq=q0(1+δ). Therefore, according to the approximation given by (37), as long as the expected excess return remains invariant, the agent will continue investing the same amount in the risky asset, as shown in Table 2. In this case, we observe that the error made with respect to the CARA case is equal to 0. This occurs because the error depends on constant values (σ, k, q0 andx0*) and also on the differenceμ−r,which is assumed to remain invariant.In this paper, we prove that it is possible to obtain comparative statics effects independent of the utility function in a general family of problems if we consider the simultaneous variation of two or more parameters. This general approach is applied to three different models in the literature: the standard portfolio model; the competitive firm under price uncertainty; and hedging and the competitive firm under price uncertainty. In all three models, we obtain different comparative statics effects independent of the decision-maker’s preferences and attitude towards risk. The main results for these specific models can be summarized as follows:The standard portfolio model.•If the excess return, as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the amount invested in the risky asset will decrease (increase) by approximately the same percentage.If the percentage decrease (increase) in the wealth obtained by the investor for each monetary unit invested in the risk-free asset coincides with the percentage increase (decrease) in his/her initial wealth, with the excess return remaining invariant as a random variable, then this investor will continue investing approximately the same amount in the risky asset.The competitive firm under price uncertainty.•If there is a specific proportional relationship between the increase (decrease) in the prices of the inputs and the increase (decrease) in the firm’s fixed costs (with the rest of parameters and variables of the model remaining invariant), then, approximately, the firm’s optimal level of output will not vary.Hedging and the competitive firm under price uncertainty.•If the excess of the spot price (over the forward/future price), as a random variable, increases (decreases) by a given percentage, then the firm will decrease (increase) the amount invested in the spot market by approximately the same percentage.Although the general model proposed in this paper encompasses many of the models in the literature, there still remain a few other models that have yet to be included in our framework. Thus, this paper provides a new direction for future research on comparative statics effects independent of the utility function in these other models. In addition, the effects obtained depend on the parameters considered, and hence new relationships may be obtained if additional parameters are added to the models herein analyzed.
