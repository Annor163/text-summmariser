@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In order to maintain a unit that is running successive works with cycle times, this paper classifies its replacement policies into three types: (Type I) Replacement with interrupted cycles; (Type II) replacement with complete works; and (Type III) replacement with incomplete works. Type I is typically done at a continuous time T while Type II is executed at a discrete number N of working cycles. Type III is proposed as an improvement of Type I, which can be done at discrete working cycles. For each type, age and periodic replacement models are respectively observed. It is shown that Type I is more flexible than Type II and costs less than Type III. However, modified replacement costs, i.e., without penalty of operational interruptions, are obtained for Types II and III as critical points at which their policies should be adopted. All discussions are presented analytically and numerical examples are given when each cycle time is exponential and the failure time has a Weibull distribution.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Manufacturing systems with performance degradation and maintenance strategy are commonly encountered in practice. To seek balance between failure losses and maintenance costs, preventive maintenances have been investigated extensively in the past decades. Recently, a methodical survey of maintenance models and their optimizations in reliability theory was done (Nakagawa, 2005). Other published books (Frenkel, Karagrigoriou, Lisnianski, and Kleyner, 2013; Kobbacy and Murthy, 2008; Kuo and Zuo, 2003; Manzini, Regattieri, Pham, and Ferrari, 2010; Nakagawa, 2008; Osaki, 2002; Pham, 2011; Wang and Pham, 2007) collected many kinds of reliability models and maintenance policies in theory and their applications in industrial systems.Although some categories of maintenance policies (Wang, 2002; Wu and Zuo, 2010) and several overviews of recent maintenance models (Ahmad and Kamaruddin, 2012; Shafiee and Chukova, 2013; Wang, 2012) have been surveyed, it can be classified in most above models that systems are maintained or replaced before failure at some continuous measures (i.e., age, operating time, running distance, damage threshold, condition level, repair cost, etc.), at some discrete quantities (i.e., number of usage, works, shocks, faults, failures, repairs, etc.), or at some bivariate maintenance times such as optimized t* along with n* (Chen, 2012; Sheu and Chang, 2010; Sheu, Li, and Chang, 2012; Zhang, Yam, and Zuo, 2007). Taking aircraft engines as an example, appropriate maintenances are usually scheduled at a total hours of operations or at a specified number of flights since the last major overhaul (Duchesne and Lawless, 2000). This also could be applied to maintenance strategies for the systems whose operational functions deteriorate with either or both causes of age and use (Nakagawa, 2008). In other words, it is advisable to maintain or replace such systems before catastrophic failure when their operations reach a certain usage time or a specified number of uses.However, there is no theoretical study to tell us whether or not maintenances scheduled at continuous measures are more predominant than those at discrete quantities, which is the first problem to be considered in this paper. On the other hand, the system usually executes works with successive cycles, e.g., number N of random cycles, so that it is difficult to specify the quality of maintenance or replacement policies (Wu and Clements-Croome, 2005) without considering the factor of executed works. The replacement policies that are scheduled along with working cycles (Chen, Mizutani, and Nakagawa, 2010) were modeled. Replacement models planned with continuous or discrete policies using the approach of whichever triggering event occurs last were discussed recently (Zhao, Nakagawa, and Zuo, 2014). However, when the system is operating for some successive works without stops, it is better to do maintenance after several works are completed even though the maintenance time has arrived (Zhao and Nakagawa, 2013). That is, maintenances scheduled at continuous times need to be modified according to discrete cycles to satisfy work completions, which is the second problem to be considered in this paper.In order to maintain a unit that is running successive works with cycle times, this paper classifies the following replacement policies scheduled at continuous and discrete times into three types:I.Replacement with interrupted cycles: The unit is replaced before failure at a planned time T, which is called continuous age replacement (CAR).Replacement with complete works: The unit is replaced before failure at completion of the Nth working cycle, which is called discrete age replacement (DAR).Replacement with incomplete works: The unit is replaced before failure at the first completion of some working cycle over a planned time T, which is called age replacement with overtime (ARO).For each type, periodic replacement policies are also considered in a similar way, that is, continuous periodic replacement (CPR), discrete periodic replacement (DPR), and periodic replacement with overtime (PRO) are defined and modeled in the following sections. Joint determinations of Types I and II, and Types II and III for age and periodic replacement models under the assumption “whichever occurs first” are also discussed.Obviously, policy defined in Type III is an improvement of that in Type I, which can be done at discrete working cycles. Policy in Type II guarantees completion of all works, e.g., N works, while part of works can be completed under Type III, but cycles are always interrupted under Type I. It will be shown that Type I is more flexible than Type II and costs less than Type III, when replacement costs for three types are originally supposed as order of “Type I ≤ Type II” and “Type I ≤ Type III”. However, the order of penalty cost for operational interruption would be “Type I > Type III > Type II”. So that how to find modified replacement costs (i.e., the replacement cost without penalty of operational interruption) for Types II and III as critical points at which their policies should be adopted become the main purpose of this paper.Consider a unit that is running successive works with cycle times Yj~(j = 1, 2, …), where random variables Yjhave an identical distributionG(t)≡Pr{Yj≤t}with finite mean 1/θ~(0 < θ < ∞). The unit deteriorates with operation and has a failure time X according to a general distributionF(t)≡Pr{X≤t}with finite mean μ~(0 < μ < ∞), which is independent of Yj.To model the following replacement policies, we denote G(j)(t)~(j = 1, 2, …) be the j-fold Stieltjes convolution of G(t) with itself and G(0)(t) ≡ 1 for t ≥ 0, g(t) ≡ dG(t)/dt, g(j)(t) ≡ dG(j)(t)/dt, and rj(t) ≡ g(j)(t)/[1 − G(j)(t)], where rj(t)dt represents the probability that the unit completes the jth working cycle in [t, t + dt], given that it has been running for the jth cycle at time t. In addition, leth(t)≡f(t)/F¯(t)be the failure rate of F(t) andH(t)≡∫0th(u)dube cumulative hazard rate, where f(t) ≡ dF(t)/dt andF¯(t)≡1−F(t). It is also assumed that h(t) increases strictly from h(0) = 0 to h(∞) ≡ limt → ∞h(t).Suppose that when the unit fails, its failure is immediately detected, and then CR (corrective replacement) is done. As PR (preventive replacement) policies, we firstly model the joint policies of Types I and II into age replacement, i.e., the unit is replaced before failure at a planned time T~(0 < T ≤ ∞) or at the completion of Nth (N = 1, 2, …) working cycle, whichever occurs first. The expected replacement cost rate is, from Chen et al. (2010),(1)C1(T;N)=cT+(cF−cT)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]dF(t)+(cN−cT)∫0TF¯(t)dG(N)(t)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]F¯(t)dt,where cFis CR cost at failure, and cT~(cF> cT) and cN~(cF> cN) are PR costs at time T and at number N, respectively.Clearly, C1(T; N) includes the respective Type I and Type II age replacement models as T → ∞ or N → ∞. That is, if N = ∞, then the policy corresponds to PR that is made at time T, which is called age replacement (Barlow and Proschan, 1965) or CAR in Type I, and the expected cost rate is(2)C1CAR(T)≡limN→∞C1(T;N)=cF−(cF−cT)F¯(T)∫0TF¯(t)dt.On the other hand, if T = ∞, the policy corresponds to PR that is made at number N of working cycles, which is called DAR in Type II, and the expected cost rate is(3)C1DAR(N)≡limT→∞C1(T;N)=cF−(cF−cN)∫0∞G(N)(t)dF(t)∫0∞[1−G(N)(t)]F¯(t)dt(N=1,2,…).We find optimal timeT1*and numberN1*which minimizesC1CAR(T)in (2) andC1DAR(N)in (3), respectively. From the results of (Nakagawa, 2005), if h(∞) > cF/[μ(cF− cT)], then there exists a finite and uniqueT1*(0<T1*<∞)which satisfies(4)∫0T1*[h(T)−h(t)]F¯(t)dt=cTcF−cT,and the resulting cost rate is(5)C1CAR(T1*)=(cF−cT)h(T1*).From the inequality C1(N + 1) − C1(N) ≥ 0,(6)QN∫0∞[1−G(N)(t)]F¯(t)dt−∫0∞[1−G(N)(t)]dF(t)≥cNcF−cN(N=1,2,…),whereQN(T)≡∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]dF(t)∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]F¯(t)dt≤h(T),and QN≡ limT → ∞QN(T). It has been proved (Chen et al., 2010) that if QNincreases strictly with N to Q∞, then the left-hand side of (6) also increases to μQ∞ − 1. Thus, if Q∞ > cF/[μ(cF− cN)], then there exists a finite and unique minimumN1*(1≤N1*<∞)which satisfies (6), and the resulting cost rate is(7)(cF−cT)QN1*−1<C1DAR(N1*)≤(cF−cT)QN1*.In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θt, i.e.,G(N)(t)=∑j=N∞[(θt)j/j!]e−θt(N=1,2,…),QN(T)=∫0T(θt)Ne−θtdF(t)∫0T(θt)Ne−θtF¯(t)dtincreases strictly with N and converges to h(T) as N → ∞, and hence QNincreases with N to h(∞). Thus, if h(∞) > cF/[μ(cF− cN)], then there exists a finite and unique minimumN1*(1≤N1*<∞)which satisfies (6).Note that if the condition h(∞) > cF/[μ(cF− ci)]~(i = T, N) holds, there exist both finiteT1*andN1*that minimize their respective cost rates.From the viewpoint of performability, the above models indicate that: Operations are always interrupted under CAR during the working cycles at time T while DAR guarantees the completion of N working cycles. However, CAR is more flexible but DAR depends on the length of cycle. In other words, the long length of each cycle may increase failure possibility even if optimized N is equal to 1.From the viewpoint of replacement cost for a long run, it is very difficult to determine which policy is better between CAR and DAR, that is, we cannot compareC1CAR(T1*)withC1DAR(N1*)analytically in theory. However, we can compare such policies according to the relative size of cTand cN. For this purpose, we firstly derive the joint determination of optimal T* and N* which minimizes C1(T; N) in (1). Differentiating C1(T; N) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(8)(cF−cT)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][h(T)−h(t)]F¯(t)dt−(cT−cN)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][rN(T)−rN(t)]F¯(t)dt=cT,and formulating the inequality C1(T; N + 1) − C1(T; N) ≥ 0,(9)(cF−cT)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][QN(T)−h(t)]F¯(t)dt+(cT−cN)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][QN(T)+RN(T)+rN(t)]F¯(t)dt≥cT(N=1,2,…),whereRN(T)≡[G(N)(T)−G(N+1)(T)]F¯(T)∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]F¯(t)dt.Substituting (8) into (9), we obtain(10)(cF−cT)[QN(T)−h(T)]+(cT−cN)[QN(T)+RN(T)+rN(T)]≥0.Recalling that QN(T) ≤ h(T), there does not exist any finite N* which satisfies (10) in case of cT≤ cN, that is, optimal T* along with N* which minimizes C1(T; N) is (0 < T* ≤ ∞; N* = ∞), i.e.,T*=T1*whereT1*is given in (4), in which case we should adopt CAR rather than DAR.In fact, cTfor CAR would be greater than cNfor DAR because of the penalty of operational interruption. That is, the above result (0 < T* ≤ ∞; N* = ∞) will not hold in practice even though we suppose cT= cN. So that, we secondly obtain a modified cost cnfor the original cNin (3) and its optimal working cyclesn1*for DAR, where cn~(cn< cT) may be considered as the replacement cost without penalty at N. That is, if we estimate previously that replacement cost cnat number N is less than cTat time T, then we can find optimaln1*for cn, which may be the critical point at which DAR is better than CAR. In other words, we may denote δ* ≡ cT− cnas the lower limit of the penalty cost for operational interruption. If we can estimate previously that penalty cost δ ∈ [δ*, +∞), then DAR should be adopted.Compute optimalT1*which satisfies (4) for given cT/cF. UsingT1*,we makeC1CAR(T1*)in (5) for given cTequal toC1DAR(n1*)in (3) for modified cn, that is, we solve the simultaneous equations forn1*and cn, from (3), (5) and (6):(11)(cF−cT)h(T1*)=cF−(cF−cn)∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt,(12)Qn1*∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt+∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)≥cFcF−cn.From (11) and (12), we can firstly compute a minimumn1*which satisfies(13)h(T1*)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt+h(T1*)Qn1*∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)≤cFcF−cT,and then compute cn/cFwhich satisfies(14)cF−cncF−cT1∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)+h(T1*)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt=cFcF−cT.Suppose that the failure time has a Weibull distributionF(t)=1−e−(λt)2and each working cycle has an exponential distribution G(t) = 1 − e−t. Table 1presents optimalT1*andN1*that satisfy (4) and (6) when cN= cT, and modified cost rates cn/cF, cn/cTand its optimal numbern1*when cn< cT.It is shown from Table 1 thatn1*<N1*because the modified cost cnis less than original cN. We take cN/cF= 0.3 and 1/λ = 5.0 as an example, modified cnequals to 0.751cT, andn1*=3that is less thanN1*=4while approximately equal toT1*=3.395. That is, if we can estimate previously any of the following: (i) replacement cost at number N is less than or equal to cn= 0.751cT, (ii) replacement cost at time T is greater than or equal to cT= (1/0.751)cn, and (iii) penalty cost δ ∈ [δ*, +∞), where δ* ≈ 0.332cn, then we should adopt DAR rather than CAR.Table 2presents replacement cost rateC1DAR(N1*)for cN/cFand modified cost rateC1DAR(n1*)for cn/cF, where cN/cFand cn/cFare respectively given in Table 1. It is shown thatC1DAR(N1*)increases with cN/cFandC1DAR(n1*)increases with cn/cF. It is also shown thatC1DAR(n1*)<C1DAR(N1*)because the modified cost cnis less than cN. That is, compared with CAR, DAR could save more replacement cost for a long run.We next consider the following periodic replacement in Types I and II. It is assumed that the unit is replaced at a planned time T~(0 < T ≤ ∞) or at the number N~(N = 1, 2, …) of working cycles, whichever occurs first, and undergoes minimal repair at each failure between replacements. The expected cost rate is, from Zhao and Nakagawa (2012),(15)C2(T;N)=cT+(cN−cT)G(N)(T)+cM∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]h(t)dt∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]dt,where cNand cTare given in (1) and cMis minimal repair cost at failure. When the unit is replaced only at a planned time T,(16)C2CPR(T)≡limN→∞C2(T;N)=cMH(T)+cTT,which is called periodic replacement (Barlow and Proschan, 1965) or CPR in Type I. When the unit is replaced only at number N of working cycles,(17)C2DPR(N)≡limT→∞C2(T;N)=cM∫0∞[1−G(N)(t)]h(t)dt+cNN/θ(N=1,2,…),which is called DPR in Type II.We find optimalT2*andN2*which minimizesC2CPR(T)in (16) andC2DPR(N)in (17), respectively. From the results of Nakagawa (2005), if∫0∞tdh(t)>cT/cF,then there exists a finite and uniqueT2*(0<T2*<∞)which satisfies(18)T2*h(T2*)−H(T2*)=cTcM,and the resulting cost rate is(19)C2CPR(T2*)=cMh(T2*).From the inequality C2(N + 1) − C2(N) ≥ 0,(20)∫0∞[1−G(N)(t)][HN−h(t)]dt≥cNcM(N=1,2,…),whereHN(T)≡∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]h(t)dt∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]dt≤h(T),andHN≡limT→∞HN(T)=θ∫0∞[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]h(t)dt.If HNincreases to H∞, then the left-hand side of (20) increases strictly with N to∫0∞[H∞−h(t)]dt. Thus, if∫0∞[H∞−h(t)]dt≥cN/cM,then there exists a finite and unique minimumN2*(1≤N2*<∞)which satisfies (20), and the resulting cost rate is(21)cMHN2*−1<C2DPR(N2*)≤cMHN2*.In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θt,HN=∫0∞θ(θt)NN!e−θth(t)dtincreases strictly to h(∞) (Nakagawa, 2008). Thus, if∫0∞tdh(t)>cN/cM,then there exists a finite and unique minimumN2*(1≤N2*<∞)which satisfies (20).Note that if the condition∫0∞tdh(t)>ci/cM(i=T,N)holds, there exist both finiteT2*andN2*that minimize their respective cost rates.In order to compare CPR with DPR, we give similar discussions as those in Section 2.2 and find whether the proposed method holds for periodic replacement. We firstly derive the joint determination of optimal T* and N* which minimizes C2(T; N) in (15). Differentiating C2(T, N) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(22)cM∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][h(T)−h(t)]dt−(cT−cN)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][rN(T)−rN(t)]dt=cT,and formulating the inequality C2(T; N + 1) − C2(T; N) ≥ 0,(23)cM∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][HN(T)−h(t)]dt+(cT−cN)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)][R˜N(T)+rN(t)]dt≥cT(N=1,2,…),whereR˜N(T)≡G(N)(T)−G(N+1)(T)∫0T[G(N)(t)−G(N+1)(t)]dt.Substituting (22) into (23), we obtain(24)cM[HN(T)−h(T)]+(cT−cN)[R˜N(T)+rN(t)]≥0.Recalling that HN(T) ≤ h(T), there does not exist any finite N* which satisfies (24) in case of cT≤ cN, that is, optimal T* along with N* which minimizes C2(T; N) is (0 < T* ≤ ∞; N* = ∞), i.e.,T*=T2*whereT2*is given in (18), in which case the unit should be replaced only at time T.Next, we compute a modified cost cnfor the original cNin (17) and its optimal numbern2*in case of cn< cTfor DPR. That is, we computeT2*which satisfies (18) for given cT/cMwhen h(∞) = ∞. UsingT2*,we makeC2CPR(T2*)in (19) equal toC2DPR(n2*)in (17) for modified cn, that is, we solve the simultaneous equations forn2*and cn/cM, from (17), (19) and (20),(25)n2*θh(T2*)−∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)]h(t)dt=cTcM,(26)∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)][Hn2*−h(t)]dt≥cncM.From (25) and (26), we can firstly compute a minimumn2*which satisfies(27)Hn2*≥h(T2*),and then compute cn/cMwhich satisfies(28)cncM=n2*θh(T2*)−∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)]h(t)dt.Suppose that h(t) = 2λ2t, H(t) = (λt)2, and G(t) = 1 − e−t. Table 3presents optimalT2*andN2*which satisfy (18) and (20) when cN= cT, and modified cost rates cn/cF, cn/cTand its optimaln2*when cn< cT, which shows a similar tendency to Table 1. Table 3 also indicates that when cN/cMor cT/cMis large,T2*≈N2*and cn/cTapproaches to 1. Table 4presents replacement cost rateC2DPR(N2*)for cN/cMand modified cost rateC2DPR(n2*)for cn/cM, where cN/cMand cn/cMare respectively given in Table 3. The proposed comparative method between Types I and II in Section 2.2 also holds for periodic replacement.It has been pointed out in Section 2.2 that cycles are always interrupted under CAR in Type I. However, we can improve CAR from the viewpoint of performability as follows: The unit is replaced before failure at the first completion of some working cycleSj≡∑i=1jYi(j=1,2,…)over a planned time T~(0 ≤ T ≤ ∞), which is called ARO in Type III. The expected replacement cost rate is, from Chen et al. (2010),(29)C3ARO(T)=cF−(cF−cO)∑j=0∞∫0T{∫T−t∞F¯(t+u)dG(u)}dG(j)(t)∫0TF¯(t)dt+∑j=0∞∫0T{∫T∞G¯(u−t)F¯(u)du}dG(j)(t),where cO~(cF> cO) is PR cost over time T.In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θt,(30)C3ARO(T)=cF−(cF−cO)∫T∞θF¯(t)e−θ(t−T)dt∫0TF¯(t)dt+∫T∞F¯(t)e−θ(t−T)dt.DifferentiatingC3ARO(T)with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(31)Q(T)∫0TF¯(t)dt−F(T)=cOcF−cO,whereQ(T)≡∫T∞e−θtdF(t)∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt≥h(T),which increases strictly with T to h(∞). Thus, if h(∞) > cF/[μ(cF− cO)], then there exists a finite and uniqueT3*(0<T3*<∞)which satisfies (31), and the resulting cost rate is(32)C3ARO(T3*)=(cF−cO)Q(T3*)=cF−(cF−cO)F¯(T3*)∫0T3*F¯(t)dt.It can be seen from the policy definition that ARO guarantees the completion of cycles but increases failure probability due to performance delay. In addition, if we suppose in (2) and (30) that cO= cT, from (32),C3ARO(T3*)≥cF−(cF−cT)F¯(T3*)∫0T3*F¯(t)dt≥C1CAR(T1*).That is, there is no need to perform ARO when cO= cTbut only CAR is adopted.However, we can obtain a modified cost cofor the original cOin (29) and its optimalt3*to determine when ARO is better than CAR, where co~(co< cT) may be considered as the replacement cost without penalty of cycle interruptions. ComputeT1*from (4) for given cT/cF. UsingT1*,we solve the simultaneous equations for coandt3*,from (5), (31) and (32),(33)(cF−co)Q(t3*)=(cF−cT)h(T1*),(34)Q(t3*)∫0t3*F¯(u)du+F¯(t3*)=cFcF−co.That is, we computet3*which satisfies(35)h(T1*)∫0t3*F¯(u)du+h(T1*)F¯(t3*)Q(t3*)=cFcF−cT,and then compute cowhich satisfies(36)cF−cocF−cT=h(T1*)Q(t3*).In order to compareC3ARO(T)in (30) withC1DAR(N)in (3), we firstly give the following joint policies in Types II and III which are scheduled for complete N works and incomplete j~(j ≤ N − 1) works: The unit is replaced before failure at number N~(N = 1, 2, …) of working cycles, or at the first completion of some working cycleSj≡∑i=1jYi(j=1,2,…,N−1)over a planned time T~(0 ≤ T ≤ ∞), whichever occurs first.The probability that the unit is replaced at number Nth of working cycles isPN=∫0TF¯(t)dG(N)(t),the probability that it is replaced at the first completion of some working cycle over time T isPO=∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞F¯(t+u)dG(u)]dG(j)(t),and the probability that it is replaced at failure isPF=∑j=0N−1∫0T{∫T−t∞[F(t+u)−F(T)]dG(u)}dG(j)(t)+∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]dF(t),where note that PN+ PO+ PF≡ 1. Then, the mean time to replacement isE(L)=∫0TtF¯(t)dG(N)(t)+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞(t+u)F¯(t+u)dG(u)]dG(j)(t)+∫0Tt[1−G(N)(t)]dF(t)+∑j=0N−1∫0T{∫T−t∞[∫Tt+uydF(y)]dG(u)}dG(j)(t)=∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]F¯(t)dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞G¯(u)F¯(t+u)du]dG(j)(t).When the planning is infinite, it is appropriate to adopt the expected cost per unit of time as an objective function (Barlow and Proschan, 1965). That is, the expected replacement cost rate is(37)C3(T;N)=cF−(cF−cO)∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞F¯(t+u)dG(u)]dG(j)(t)−(cF−cN)∫0TF¯(t)dG(N)(t)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]F¯(t)dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T∫T−t∞[G¯(u)F¯(t+u)du]dG(j)(t).Clearly,limN→∞C3(T;N)=C3ARO(T)andlimT→∞C3(T;N)=C1DAR(N),whereC3ARO(T)andC1DAR(N)are given in (29) and (3), respectively.In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θtand cO= cN, (37) becomes(38)C3(T;N)=cF+(cF−cO)∑j=0N−2∫0Tθ[(θt)j/j!]e−θtF¯(t)dt∑j=0N−1(θT)j/j!∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T(θt)j/j!e−θtF¯(t)dt−θ(cF−cO).Differentiating C3(T; N) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(39)e−θTF¯(T)∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt∑j=0N−1[(θT)jj!∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt+∫0T(θt)jj!e−θtF¯(t)dt]−∑j=0N−2∫0Tθ(θt)jj!e−θtF¯(t)dt=cFcF−cO,and formulating the inequality C3(T; N + 1) − C3(T; N) ≥ 0,(40)∫0Tθ(θt)N−1e−θtF¯(t)dt∫0T(θt)N−1[∫t∞e−θuF¯(u)du]dt×∑j=0N−1[(θT)jj!∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt+∫0T(θt)jj!e−θtF¯(t)dt]−∑j=0N−2∫0Tθ(θt)jj!e−θtF¯(t)dt≥cFcF−cO(N=1,2,…),where∑j=0−1≡0and note that(θT)NN!∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt+∫0T(θt)NN!e−θtF¯(t)dt=∫0Tθ(θt)N−1(N−1)![∫t∞e−θuF¯(u)du]dt.Substituting (39) into (40),(41)∫0T(θt)N−1e−θtF¯(t)dt∫0T(θt)N−1[∫t∞e−θuF¯(u)du]dt≥e−θTF¯(T)∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt≡QO(T).Using the relatione−θTF¯(T)∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt−θ=∫T∞e−θtdF(t)∫T∞e−θtF¯(t)dt=Q(T),we have∫0T(θt)N−1e−θtF¯(t)dt∫0T(θt)N−1[∫t∞e−θuF¯(u)du]dt−θ=∫0T(θt)N−1[∫t∞e−θudF(u)]dt∫0T(θt)N−1[∫t∞e−θuF¯(u)du]dt≤QO(T).Thus, there does not exist any finite N* which satisfies (41) in case of cO= cN, that is, optimal T* along with N* which minimizes C3(T; N) is (0 < T* ≤ ∞; N* = ∞), i.e.,T*=T3*whereT3*is given in (31), in which case we should adopt ARO rather than DAR.We next obtain modified cnfor the original cNin (3) and its optimaln1*when DAR is better than ARO, where cn~(cn< cO) may be considered as the replacement cost without penalty of incomplete works. ComputeT3*from (31). UsingT3*,we solve the simultaneous equations for cnandn1*,from (3), (6) and (32),(42)cF−(cF−cn)∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt=(cF−cO)Q(T3*),(43)Qn1*∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt+∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)≥cFcF−cn.That is, we compute a minimumn1*which satisfies(44)Q(T3*)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt+Q(T3*)Qn1*∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t)≤cFcF−cO,and then compute cnwhich satisfies(45)cF−cn=cF−(cF−cO)Q(T3*)∫0∞[1−G(n1*)(t)]F¯(t)dt∫0∞G(n1*)(t)dF(t).When the distributions of failure time X and working cycle times Yjare given in Section 2.2, i.e.,F(t)=1−e−(λt)2and G(t) = 1 − e−t, we compute and analyze the above models numerically.Table 5presents optimalT1*andT3*which satisfy (4) and (31) when cO= cT, and modified cost rates co/cF, co/cTand its optimal timet3*when co< cT. This indicates that bothT1*andT3*increase with cT/cFand 1/λ, and modified cost cois less than cT. It also can be seen thatt3*<T3*<T1*<t3*+1/θ=1.0,andt3*≈T3*and co/cTapproaches to 1 as cT/cFbecomes larger. This can be explained as follows: When cO= cT, CAR is better than ARO even thoughT3*<T1*,becauseT3*+α(0<α<1/θ)may be greater thanT1*which increases failure possibility due to performance delay; optimalt3*<T3*can be considered as improvement for ARO due to co< cTso that modified cois a critical point at which ARO is better than CAR.Table 6presents replacement cost rateC3ARO(T3*)for cO/cFand modified cost rateC3ARO(t3*)for co/cF, where cO/cFand co/cFare respectively given in Table 5. It is shown how much cost ARO could save for a long run.Table 7presents optimalT3*andN1*which satisfy (31) and (6) when cN= cO, and modified cost rates cn/cF, cn/cOand its optimal numbern1*when cn< cO. Table 8presents replacement cost rateC1DAR(N1*)for cN/cFand modified cost rateC1DAR(n1*)for cn/cF, where cN/cFand cn/cFare respectively given in Table 7. As a modification of CAR, this shows a similar tendency to Table 1, i.e.,T3*<N1*for cN= cOwhen ARO is better than DAR, andn1*≤N1*due to cn< cOin which case DAR is better.Suppose in periodic replacement that the unit undergoes minimal repairs at failures and is replaced at the first completion of some working cycleSj≡∑i=1jYi(j=1,2,…)over a planned time T~(0 ≤ T ≤ ∞), which is called PRO in Type III. The expected cost rate is, from Zhao and Nakagawa (2013),(46)C4PRO(T)=cM{H(T)+∫T∞G¯(t)h(t)dt+∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)h(u)du]dM(t)}+cOT+∫T∞G¯(t)dt+∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)du]dM(t).In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θt,(47)C4PRO(T)=cM[H(T)+∫0∞e−θth(t+T)dt]+cOT+1/θ.DifferentiatingC4PRO(T)with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(48)∫0Ttdh(t)+∫T∞e−θ(t−T)dh(t)=cOcM,whose left-hand increases strictly to∫0∞tdh(t). Thus, if∫0∞tdh(t)>cO/cM,then there exists a finite and uniqueT4*(0<T4*<∞)which satisfies (48), and the expected cost rate is(49)C4PRO(T4*)=cM∫0∞θe−θth(t+T4*)dt=cMH(T4*)+cOT4*.First, we suppose in (16) and (47) that cO= cT, from (49),C4PRO(T4*)≥cMH(T4*)+cTT4*≥C2CPR(T2*).That is, CPR should be adopted.Second, we obtain modified co~(co< cT) for the original cOin (46) andt4*when PRO is better than CPR. ComputeT2*from (18) for given cT/cM. UsingT2*,we computet4*which satisfies, from (19) and (49),(50)∫0∞θe−θuh(u+t4*)du=h(T2*),and then compute cowhich satisfies, from (48),(51)∫0t4*th(t)dt+∫t4*∞e−θ(t−t4*)dh(t)=cocM.In order to compareC4PRO(T)in (47) andC2DPR(N)in (17), we also give the following joint policies in Types II and III which are scheduled for complete N works and incomplete j~(j ≤ N − 1) works: The unit is replaced at number N~(N = 1, 2, …) of working cycles, or at the first completion of some working cycleSj≡∑i=1jYi(j=1,2,…,N−1)over a planned time T~(0 ≤ T ≤ ∞), whichever occurs first, and undergoes minimal repairs at failures.The mean time to replacement isE(L)=∫0TtdG(N)(t)+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞(t+u)dG(u)]dG(j)(t)=∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)du]dG(j)(t),and the expected number of minimal repairs until replacement isNM=∫0TH(t)dG(N)(t)+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T−t∞H(t+u)dG(u)]dG(j)(t)=∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]h(t)dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)h(u)du]dG(j)(t).Therefore, the expected cost rate is(52)C4(T;N)=cM{∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]h(t)dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)h(u)du]dG(j)(t)}+cO+(cN−cO)G(N)(T)∫0T[1−G(N)(t)]dt+∑j=0N−1∫0T[∫T∞G¯(u−t)du]dG(N)(t).Clearly,limN→∞C4(T;N)=C4PRO(T)andlimT→∞C4(T;N)=C2DPR(N).In particular, when G(t) = 1 − e−θtand cO= cN, (52) becomes(53)C4(T;N)=cM∑j=0N−1{[(θT)j/j!]∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T[(θt)j/j!]e−θth(t)dt}+cO(1/θ)∑j=0N−1∑i=j∞[(θT)i/i!]e−θT.Differentiating C4(T; N) with respect to T and setting it equal to zero,(54)∫T∞e−θ(t−T)h(t)dt∑j=0N−1∑i=j∞(θT)jj!e−θT−∑j=0N−1[(θT)jj!∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T(θt)jj!e−θth(t)dt]=cOcM,and formulating the inequality C4(T; N + 1) − C4(T; N) ≥ 0,(55)[(θT)N/N!]∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T[(θt)N/N!]e−θth(t)dt∑j=N∞[(θT)j/j!]e−θT×∑j=0N−1∑i=j∞(θT)jj!e−θT−∑j=0N−1[(θT)jj!∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T(θt)jj!e−θth(t)dt]≥cOcM(N=1,2,…).Substituting (54) into (55),(56)[(θT)N/N!]∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T[(θt)N/N!]e−θth(t)dt∑j=N∞[(θT)j/j!]e−θT≥∫T∞e−θ(t−T)h(t)dt.First, prove that∫T∞e−θ(t−T)h(t)dt∑j=N∞(θT)jj!e−θT≥(θT)NN!∫T∞e−θth(t)dt+∫0T(θt)NN!e−θth(t)dt.Clearly,∫0∞θe−θth(t+T)dt∑j=N+1∞(θT)jje−θT−∫0Tθ(θt)NNe−θth(t)dt=∫0∞θe−θt[h(t+T)−h(T)]dt+∑j=N+1∞∫0T(θt)NNe−θtdh(t)≥0.Thus, there does not exist any finite N* which satisfies (56) in case of cO= cN, that is, optimal T* along with N* which minimizes C4(T; N) is (0 < T* ≤ ∞; N* = ∞), i.e.,T*=T4*whereT4*is given in (48), in which case we should adopt PRO rather than DPR.We next obtain modified cn~(cn< cO) for the original cNin (17) and its optimaln2*when DPR is better than PRO. ComputeT4*from (48). UsingT4*,we solve the simultaneous equations for cnandn2*,from (17), (20) and (49),(57)cM∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)]h(t)dt+cnn2*/θ=cM∫0∞θe−θth(t+T4*)dt,(58)n2*θHn2*−∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)]h(t)dt≥cncM.That is, we compute a minimumn2*which satisfies(59)Hn2*≥∫0∞θe−θth(t+T4*)dt,and then compute cnwhich satisfies(60)cncM=n2*∫0∞e−θth(t+T4*)dt−∫0∞[1−G(n2*)(t)]h(t)dt.Suppose that h(t) = 2λ2t, H(t) = (λt)2, and G(t) = 1 − e−t. Table 9presents optimalT2*andT4*which satisfy (18) and (48) when cO= cT, and modified cost rates co/cM, co/cTand its optimalt4*when co< cT.

Table 12presents replacement cost rateC2DPR(N2*)for cN/cMand modified cost rateC2DPR(n2*)for cn/cM, where cN/cMand cn/cMare respectively given in Table 11. All these show similar tendencies to Tables 5 and 7, that is, discussions in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 also hold for periodic replacement with overtime.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have answered the problem which replacement is better for continuous and discrete scheduled times. Not only that, but we have classified such replacement policies for a running unit into three types according to the work completion statuses. That is, Type I is known as replacement with interrupted cycles, which is scheduled before failure at a continuous time T; Type II is named as replacement with complete works, and its policy is executed before failure at a discrete number N of working cycles; and Type III is an improvement of Type I but can be done at discrete working cycles, which is defined as replacement with incomplete works and is performed before failure at the first completion of some working cycle over time T. In order to compare above three types of replacements, age and periodic replacement policies have been considered, respectively. That is, the following models have been included: CAR and CPR for Type I, DAR and DPR for Type II, and ARO and PRO for Type III.Taking age replacement models of three types for examples, it has been firstly revealed that CAR interrupts working cycles but is more flexible to prevent failure, while DAR guarantees work completions but leads to higher failure possibility. When two replacement costs for CAR and DAR are equal to each other, joint determination of the bivariate policies does not exist, in which case CAR is better than DAR. Modified replacement cost without penalty of operational interruptions for DAR has been obtained as a critical point at which DAR is better than CAR. Secondly, it has been indicated that ARO is one kind of policy between CAR and DAR, which completes some parts of works with some level of increased failure possibility. Modified replacement cost without penalty of cycle interruptions for ARO when ARO is better than CAR and modified replacement cost without penalty of incomplete works for DAR when DAR is better than ARO have been obtained. Similar results have also been found for periodic replacement polices, by comparing CPR with DPR, PRO with CPR, and PRO and DPR.As further studies, we can focus on the policies in Type III. As already shown in Sections 4.2 and 5.2, policies are executed without interrupting working cycles, however, all bivariate replacement models are based on “whichever occurs first”, which may cause frequent and unnecessary replacements. If our purpose is to minimize the replacement cost rate meanwhile to maximize the number of completed works, the newly proposed “whichever occurs last” can be applied to this modeling, as indicated in Zhao and Nakagawa (2012), which can be considered as a common approach in application.
