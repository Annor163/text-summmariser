@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper considers a firm that faces a declining profit stream for its established product. The firm has the option to invest in a new technology with which it can produce an innovative product while having the option to exit at any point in time. In the presence of an exit option, earlier work determined the optimal timing to invest, where it was shown that higher uncertainty might accelerate investment timing. In the present paper the firm also decides on capacity. This extension leads to monotonicity, i.e. higher uncertainty delays investment timing. We also find that higher potential profitability of the innovative product market increases the incentive to invest earlier, where, however, we get the counterintuitive result that the firm invests in smaller capacity. Finally, if quantity has a smaller negative effect on price, the firm wants to acquire a larger capacity at a lower investment threshold.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The photography industry underwent a disruptive change in technology during 1990s when the traditional film was replaced by digital photography (see e.g. The Economist January 14th 2012). In particular Kodak was largely affected: by 1976 Kodak accounted for 90 percent of film and 85 percent of camera sales in America, making it the owner of a near-monopoly in America. While Kodak’s revenues were nearly 16 billion in 1996, in 2011 it has decreased to 6 billion.11See, for example, the Wall Street Journal on January 19, 2012 (http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/01/19/kodak-bankruptcy-by-the-numbers/).Kodak tried to get (squeeze) as much money out of the film business as possible and it prepared for the switch to digital film. The result was that Kodak did eventually build a profitable business out of digital cameras, but it lasted only a few years before camera phones overtook it. According to Mr. Komori, the former CEO of Fujifilm of 2000–2003, Kodak aimed to be a digital company, but that is a small business and not enough to support a big company. ’For Kodak it was like seeing a tsunami coming and there is nothing you can do about it’, according to Mr. Christensen in The Economist (January 14th 2012).This paper focuses on investment and exit decisions of a firm that has to deal with technological change. The above example showed that this can be a burden. However, there are enough examples of firms for which technological change brought fruitful times in terms of profits. One example is Activision, a successful company in the video game industry, where innovation plays a big role. Activision saw its worldwide sales increase with dollar 650 million in the first five days, when the new video game “Call of Duty: Black Ops” replaced its predecessor, “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” , in November 2010 (The Economist, December 10th 2011). Another example is the iPhone launched by Apple which was described by Time Magazine as ’the invention of the year 2007’. Apple’s 2011 net income was dollar 7.31 billion in the three months up to June 25th, 125 percent higher than the previous year, making it the firm’s record quarterly profit. Another quarterly record was the revenue during that time period, a revenue of dollar 28.6 billion.We study the problem of a price setting firm that produces with a current technology that faces a declining sales volume. The firm can either exit this industry or invest in a new technology with which it can produce an innovative product. The firm is a monopolist in a market characterized by uncertain demand, where the inverse demand function depends on a geometric Brownian motion process. Demand for the established product is characterized by a negative drift. Upon investment the firm is able to produce a new product, the demand of which is higher than demand of the established product. However, demand could still have a negative drift.The question we study is when and if it is optimal to enter the innovative product market. In case the firm decides to launch the new product we also analyze the optimal capacity choice. Besides adopting the new technology, the firm also has the option to exit the market at any point in time. It can exit if it considers that the potential of the new product market is not profitable enough to invest and thus decides to exit instead of launching the new product. The exit option is conserved beyond the time of that potential investment in the new product. Therefore, the firm can also exit the market of the new product irrevocably at any time. Previous literature (Kwon, 2010; Matomaki, 2013) considering the option to exit in combination with deciding about the optimal time to invest, found that it could be optimal to invest earlier when uncertainty goes up. We extend these papers by letting the firm also determine the optimal capacity size that should be acquired at the moment of investment, where the firm produces at capacity.We derive the result that the optimal policy of the considered stopping problem exists and is unique. In addition we show that as uncertainty goes up, the firm invests in more capacity, which is an additional cause for investment delay. Unlike Kwon (2010) and Matomaki (2013), we find that this generates monotonicity regarding the effect of uncertainty on investment timing: when uncertainty goes up the firm invests later in a larger capacity level.It turns out that innovative product market growth has a surprising effect in that the firm reduces investment size when the trend is higher. This is because timing is leading: a firm is eager to invest early in a fast growing market. Then the innovative output price is still low, which leads to a lower optimal capacity. An important characteristic of the new market is also in how strong output price is negatively affected by quantity sold. In fact this quantity is equal to the firm’s capacity level because the firm produces at capacity. If this effect is larger the firm of course invests in a smaller capacity. Concerning timing, we conclude that if quantity is strongly affecting price, the profitability of the new market is relatively low, which drives the firm to invest later.This paper is organized as follows. We review related literature in Section 2. Our model is presented in Section 3, whereas Section 4 contains a benchmark model where the firm cannot exit. The comparative statics analysis of the optimal policies is conducted in Section 5. Our main results are presented in Section 6 and we conclude in Section 7. The appendix contains the proofs of all the propositions.A number of existing research contributions have analyzed several aspects of optimal technology adoption and exit decisions under uncertainty. There is extensive literature dealing with technology adoption (see Bridges, Coughlan, and Kalish, 1991 for an early review). Many papers formulated adoption decisions of new technology as stopping time problems. We refer to Hoppe (2002) for an extensive review of papers and Kwon (2010) for a review of more recent literature. We use a real options framework to model the technology investment decision.Farzin, Huisman, and Kort (1998) (see also Doraszelski, 2001) study the optimal timing of technology adoption when technology choice is irreversible and the firm faces a stochastic innovation process modeled by a compound Poisson process. Besides the uncertainty about the speed of the arrival the value of future improvements is assumed to be uncertain as well. They allow for multiple investments in new technology. Contrasting the optimal decision rule derived under the real options approach with that obtained under the net present value method, Farzin et al. (1998) show that the former implies a more cautious and slower pace of adoption than implied by the latter. This finding is in line with the conventional insight of real options literature about the effect of uncertainty on investment decisions: as uncertainty increases, it is optimal to wait longer before investment, reflecting the value of waiting (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). In Farzin et al. (1998) the improvement of new technology follows a compound Poisson process. Recently, Hagspiel, Huisman, and Nunes (2015) extended Farzin et al. (1998) to a time-dependent intensity rate of new arrivals. They show that larger variance can accelerate investment in case the arrival rate rises while it can decelerate investment in case the arrival rate drops. Depending on whether the arrival rate is assumed to change or be constant over time, Hagspiel et al. (2015) show that the optimal technology adoption timing changes significantly.Alvarez and Stenbacka (2001) characterize the optimal timing of when to adopt an incumbent technology, incorporating the opportunity to update this technology to future superior versions. In their study a switch of technology is assumed to generate a structural change in the cash flow, whereas the underlying stochastic process is assumed to be unchanged. They characterize how the real option values depend on market uncertainty and on the uncorrelated technological uncertainty regarding future new generations of technology. They show that in case the market uncertainty follows a geometric Brownian motion, an increase in uncertainty related to market as well as technological uncertainty delays optimal investment.Some of the earliest work on entry and exit decisions goes back to Mossin (1968). McDonald and Siegel (1985), Brennan and Schwartz (1985) as well as Dixit (1989) are among the pioneering works that evaluate those decisions in the context of real options. McDonald and Siegel (1985) contemplate a case where operations can be suspended (mothballing decision), when operating profits are negative, and resumed at no additional costs if they turn positive again. Brennan and Schwartz (1985) introduce a model to optimally decide on opening, closing, and abandoning a mine. Dixit (1989) generalizes their framework assuming that there might be costs related to switching between suspension and an operating mode.In our model the firm has the option to exit the market, which is considered to be an irreversible decision. This option to exit remains available also after investment. To our knowledge, there are only two papers that consider an exit option both before and after a possible investment. The first one to study this problem was Kwon (2010). Kwon (2010) analyzes the impact of uncertainty on a firm’s optimal investment and exit decisions given that profit is expected to decline over time, in case the firm does not invest. The firm has the opportunity to make an investment that boosts the project‘s profit rate. He shows that it can be optimal to invest even in a declining market, and exit if the profit rate has deteriorated sufficiently.(Matomaki, 2013, Article I) generalizes Kwon (2010), whose work relies on a Brownian motion with negative drift as underlying diffusion. He proves the existence and uniqueness of an optimal strategy when the stochastic process satisfies a general linear Ito^diffusion with different drifts and volatilities before and after the possible investment. Matomaki (2013) shows that for the case of a geometric Brownian motion with the same volatilities before and after investment (i.e. under the same assumptions as in this work), the effect of uncertainty on the investment threshold can be non-monotonic when the boost on the profit flow upon investment is relatively large. Specifically, the investment threshold first decreases and then increases in uncertainty.We extend Kwon (2010) and Matomaki (2013) by also considering the size of the investment. This contrasts with the bulk of papers in the real options literature that only considers the time to invest. However, an investment decision is not only about timing but also about how much to invest. The papers that also take this into consideration, like Dixit (1993), Bar-Ilan and Strange (1999), Dangl (1999), and Chronopoulos, De Reyck, and Siddiqui (2013), mainly find that when uncertainty goes up the firm not only delays the time to invest, but also invests in a larger capacity. Hagspiel (2011) confirms this literature in that more uncertainty results in both delayed investment timing and larger capacity. Recently, Huisman and Kort (2015) considered a framework where investing firms also have to deal with competition while determining their optimal capacity choice. We differ from this work by including the exit decision and a change in demand structure upon investment.The firm currently operates in a declining market, producing an established product, denoted by index 1. The quantity is denoted by q1, whilst the price is denoted by p1(.). The relationship between the two is given by the following inverse demand function:p1(t)=θ1(t)(1−η1q1),where η1 is a positive constant, and the processθ1={θ1(t),t}follows a geometric Brownian motion, with dynamicsdθ1=α1θ1dt+σθ1dz.The stochastic process {θ1(t), t}, being proportional to the output price, represents how demand develops over time. It is governed by two parameters. The parameter α1(< 0) stands for the general market trend. Its negativity results in the declining market that we aim to model. How demand develops over time is uncertain beforehand. This part is captured by the term σθ1dz, so that the parameter σ represents the extent to which future demand is uncertain. By varying σ we can analyze how different levels of uncertainty affect dynamic firm behavior. z denotes a Brownian motion process. We assume that the firm is risk-neutral, and discounts against rate r, with r > α1. If this inequality does not hold, by choosing a later point to invest or exit the discounted revenue stream could be made indefinitely larger. Thus waiting longer would always be a better policy, and the optimum would not exist (see, e.g., Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).The firm produces the established product with capacity K1. It holds thatq1=K1,i.e. the firm always produces up to capacity. This assumption is often referred to as the ‘market clearance assumption’ (see, e.g., Anand and Girotra, 2007; Chod and Rudi, 2005; Goyal and Netessine, 2007 and Deneckere, Marvel, & Peck, 1997). Always producing up to capacity arises because firms may find it difficult to produce below capacity due to fixed costs associated with, for example, labor, commitments to suppliers, and production ramp-up (Goyal & Netessine, 2007). Even when firms can keep some capacity idle, a temporary suspension of production is often costly. This is the case, for example, due to maintenance costs needed to avoid deterioration of the equipment. Therefore, in practice firms often reduce prices to keep production lines running (see Anand and Girotra, 2007; Goyal and Netessine, 2007 and Mackintosh, 2003). However, counterexamples to the assumption of producing up to capacity also exist. Hagspiel, Huisman, and Kort (2014) showed that allowing the firm to produce below capacity leads to larger capacity investment while the effect on timing shows a tradeoff: on the one hand the firm likes to invest earlier as the project is more valuable due to this volume flexibility, but on the other hand the firm has an incentive to invest later because investing in a larger capacity is more costly.We distinguish between two types of cost. On the one hand the firm faces a fixed cost F. On the other hand it has to incur fixed unit production costs, which are equal to a constant c.The firm has the option to start producing an innovative product, denoted by index 2, which requires an investment in production capacity. The capacity of the new product is denoted by K2. The investment cost is a sunk cost and equal to δK2, with δ being a positive constant.Because this innovative market grows faster than the old one, we assume that the demand process changes. We denote the demand process for this innovative market by {θ2(t), t}, with(1)dθ2=α2θ2dt+σθ2dz,where α2 > α1, since demand is higher for the new product. Still we impose that α2 < r in order for a finite investment time to be optimal. Furthermore, if the firm decides to invest in this new market at time τ1, then we assume thatθ2(0)=θ1(τ1),meaning that the process {θ2(t), t} starts only to evolve after the firm decides to invest in the new market, and its initial value is precisely the demand level of the old market at the investment time.Denoting the price and the quantity of the new product by p2(.) and q2, respectively, at the moment of the new product launch the firm’s demand function changes into:(2)p2(t)=θ2(t)(1−η2q2),where the constant η2 is positive and such that η2 < η1. This inequality indicates that we have vertical product differentiation in the sense that the new product is qualitatively better than the established one so that profit is larger. As in the first market, we assume that the firm produces up to capacity, i.e.q2=K2.The cost structure for the new product also changes after the new product launch. While the fixed cost still equals F, there are no variable costs. We motivate this assumption, on the one hand, by observing that in the digital world the unit cost of a product is most of the time very small. For many software products like for example video games, costs of producing an additional copy are very small or negligible. On the other hand our qualitative results carry over to a framework where unit costs are lower but positive for the second innovative product. Therefore, we set the unit cost of the second product to zero in order to save on notation.Investing in the new product requires that the firm chooses the optimal time as well as the optimal size of the capacity investment. It can be the case that the new market is not profitable enough for an investment to be undertaken. Since the established product market is declining, it can be optimal for the firm to exercise the option to exit the market. We also allow for the possibility to exit the market after the investment in the innovative product has taken place. We refrain from imposing an exit cost. If it were costly to exit the old market, investing in the new product might be better than exiting the old market in some instances where currently exit would be optimal. However, investing in the second market might be less appealing as the option to exit in the second market is costly22We thank one of the referees for mentioning this model alternative.. The optimal stopping problem can now be stated as follows, given that the current demand is ξ1:(3)V(ξ1)=supτ1IE[∫0τ1e−rtΠ1(θ1(t))dt+e−rτ1max{0,∫maxK2(supτ21{τ2>τ1}×IE[∫τ1τ2e−r(t−τ1)Π2(θ2(t−τ1),K2)dt|θ2(0)=θ1(τ1)]−δK2)}|θ1(0)=ξ1],meaning that until time τ1 the firm is producing and earning a profit flow Π1, that is a function of the demand process (θ1(t)). Time τ1 is the first time that the firm decides either to invest in product 2 or to exit the market. If it is more profitable for the firm to exit the market, then the decision problem ends. If the firm decides to invest in the second market, then the instantaneous profit is Π2, that depends on the new demand process (θ2(t)), until it decides to exit the market, which happens at time τ2. Note that in Eq. (3) we make use of the assumption that the initial demand level in market 2 is equal to the demand level in market 1 when the firm decides to invest (i.e.,θ2(0)=θ1(τ1)).Finally, we note that τ1 and τ2 are both stopping times. As the decision to exit market 2 has to be taken after deciding to either invest in this market or exit, one must have τ1 < τ2 with probability one. Later on, when we will present the solution to the problem, we will define τ1 and τ2 formally as stopping times.To determine the value of investing in product 2, we first solve the subproblem that is stated at the right hand side of the maximization in Eq. (3). Considering a specific value forθ2(0)=ξ2the net expected discounted profit of investing in product 2 is given by(4)V2(ξ2,K2)=supτ2IEξ2[∫τ1τ2e−r(t−τ1)Π2(θ2(t−τ1,K2))dt],=supτ2IEξ2[∫0τ2−τ1e−rtΠ2(θ2(t),K2)dt],=supτ˜IEξ2[∫0τ˜e−rtΠ2(θ2(t),K2)dt],whereIEξ2denotes the expectation with respect to the process θ2, when its initial state is ξ2. Employing Eq. (4) we can rewrite expression (3) as follows:(5)V(ξ1)=supτ1IE[∫0τ1e−rtΠ1(θ1(t))dt+e−rτ1max{0,∫maxK2(V2(θ1(τ1),K2)−δK2)}|θ1(0)=ξ1].In order to simplify the notation, from now on we use θ for the realized values of θ1 and θ2 whenever it is clear from the context which process is referred to. The optimal stopping problem in (4) is a standard problem. The instantaneous profit for product 2, when the current demand level is θ, is given by:Π2(θ,K2)=p2q2−F=θ(1−η2K2)K2−F.Stating the optimal stopping problem in the form of a Bellman equation and applying Ito’s Lemma yields the following partial differential equation that V2(., .) satisfies12σ2θ2∂2V2(θ,K2)∂θ2+α2θ∂V2(θ,K2)∂θ−rV2(θ,K2)+θ(1−η2K2)K2−F=0.Solving this differential equation gives the following expression for the optimal value function V2:(6)V2(θ,K2)={θK2(1−η2K2)r−α2−Fr+Gθβ4θ>θE2,0θ≤θE2.The first term stands for the expected discounted revenue stream on the innovative market. The discounted stream of fixed cost is represented by the second term. The termGθβ4represents the value of the option to exit. When the stochastic process θ falls belowθE2it is optimal for the firm to exit. The exit thresholdθE2,as well as the specific expression of the unknown G, can be easily derived applying value matching and smooth pasting at the exit threshold:(7)V2(θ,K2)|θ=θE2=0,(8)∂V2(θ,K2)∂θ|θ=θE2=0.Solving these equations one can easily derive the exit thresholdθE2,and the expression for the parameter G:θE2=(β4β4−1)F(r−α2)rK2(1−η2K2),G=θE2−β4(11−β4)Fr.Furthermore, β4 is the negative root of the quadratic equation12σ2β(β−1)+α2β−r=0. We note that we use the notation V2(θ, K2) in order to emphasize the dependence of the value function not only on the actual demand level θ but also on the capacity of the new product K2.Next, consider the situation before the investment. Let us first determine the current instantaneous profits, and assume that the current demand is θ. The instantaneous profit equals:Π1(θ)=θK1(1−η1K1)−cK1−F.Facing the declining profit stream in market 1, the firm has two possibilities, either to exit the market or to undergo investment to bring a new product on the market. We denote the exit threshold byθE1and the investment threshold by θI, respectively. The following proposition states that the optimal policy for the stopping problem always exists and specifies the optimal value function of the firm.Proposition 1The optimal policy for the stopping problem of Eq.(3)always exists. The optimal continuation region isD*=(θE1,θI). It is optimal to exit the market whenθ≤θE1and invest in the new product when θ ≥ θI. The corresponding value of the firm in the stopping region is equal toΩ(θ)=max{0,V2(θ,K2)−δK2}.The optimal value function is uniquely given byV(θ)={V1(θ)forθ∈D*,Ω(θ)otherwise,whereV1(θ)=θK1(1−η1K1)r−α1−cK1+Fr+A1θβ1+A2θβ2,with A1and A2being constants to be derived such that V(.) is continuous and differentiable at the boundary of D, and β1(β2) is the positive (negative) root of the quadratic equation12σ2β(β−1)+α1β−r=0.Given that the firm invests in the new product, the optimal production capacity has to be determined. To do so, we computemaxK2∈[0,∞]{V2(θI,K2)−δK2}. We can just compute the zero of∂(V2(θI,K2)−δK2)∂K2,and then check that∂2(V2(θI,K2)−δK2)∂2K2<0.To determine the optimal exit and investment policy we apply the following value matching and smooth pasting conditions:(9)V1(θ)|θ=θE1=0,(10)∂V1(θ)∂θ|θ=θE1=0,(11)V1(θ)|θ=θI=V2(θ,K2)|θ=θI−δK2,(12)∂V1(θ)∂θ|θ=θI=∂V2(θ,K2)∂θ|θ=θI.This leads to the results presented in Proposition 2.Proposition 2The optimal capacity K2is implicitly given by the following equation:(13)θI(1−2η2K2)r−α2−δ+∂G∂K2θIβ4=0,with(14)∂G∂K2=(β4β4−1)FrθE2−β4−1∂θE2∂K2,(15)∂θE2∂K2=(β4β4−1)F(r−α2)r[η2K2(1−η2K2)2−1K22(1−η2K2)].The investment and exit thresholds (θI andθE1) are then solutions of the following equations:(16)θIK1(1−η1K1)r−α1−β1(β1−1)cK1r+(β1−β2)(β1−1)A2(θE1)θIβ2=θIK2(1−η2K2)r−α2−β1(β1−1)δK2+(β1−β4)(β1−1)GθIβ4,(17)θIK1(1−η1K1)r−α1−β2(β2−1)cK1r+(β2−β1)(β2−1)A1(θE1)θIβ1=θIK2(1−η2K2)r−α2−β2(β2−1)δK2+(β2−β4)(β2−1)GθIβ4,with A1and A2given by:A1=θE11−β1(1β1−β2)[(β2−1)K1(1−η1K1)r−α1−β2θE1−1(cK1+Fr)],A2=θE11−β2(−1β1−β2)[(β1−1)K1(1−η1K1)r−α1−β1θE1−1(cK1+Fr)].Finally, we are now in the position to formally define the stopping times τ1 and τ2 used in Eq. (3):(18)τ1=inf{t:θ1(t)∉(θE1,θI)};τ2=inf{t:θ2(t)<θE2}.Allowing for the option to exit does not lead to explicit expressions for the relevant thresholds and the investment capacity level. For these reasons we consider a simplified model that is fully analytically tractable. This section presents such a model, which will serve as a benchmark for the analysis of the model introduced in Section 3. In particular, we set the variable and fixed production costs equal to zero, i.e.,F=c=0. The implication is that the firm has no incentive to exit. Analogous to Proposition 1, we have the following result.Proposition 3The optimal policy for the stopping problem ofEq. (3)whenF=c=0,always exists. It is optimal to invest in the new product when θ ≥ θI. The corresponding value of the firm in the stopping region is equal toΩ(θ)=[V2(θ,K2)−δK2],withV2(θ,K2)=θK2(1−η2K2)r−α2. The optimal value function is uniquely given byV(θ)={V1(θ)forθ<θI,Ω(θ)otherwise,whereV1(θ)=θK1(1−η1K1)r−α1+A1θβ1,and β1is the positive root of the quadratic equation12σ2β(β−1)+α1β−r=0.Furthermore, we have the following value matching and smooth pasting conditions:(19)V1(θ)+Aθβ1=V2(θ,K2)−δK2|θ=θI,(20)∂V1(θ)∂θ+β1Aθβ1−1=∂V2(θ,K2)∂θ−δK2|θ=θI.From these conditions and maximizing the value function V2 with respect to K2 we obtain:(21)θI(K2)=β1β1−1δK2K2(1−η2K2)r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1,(22)K2(θ)=12η2(1−δ(r−α2)θ).This leads to the investment rule presented in the following proposition.Proposition 4The optimal capacity K2and the investment threshold θI are given by(23)K2=1+1+4η2(r−α2)(β12−1)K1(1−η1K1)r−α12(β1+1)η2,(24)θI=(β1+1)δ(r−α2)β1−1+4η2(r−α2)(β12−1)K1(1−η1K1)r−α1.This section conducts a comparative statics analysis of the value of the firm after the investment in the innovative product, V2, and the value of the firm for the whole situation,V,respectively, as well as the exit threshold,θE2,that relates to exiting after the firm has invested in the innovative product. We also present results concerning the probability of investment before exit, and the expected time to undertake a decision in the established market, the expected time to exit the innovative market and the expected time that the firm will stay in production. The proofs of all propositions can be found in Appendix A.We first establish the convexity of V2, which is important for later comparative statics results.Proposition 5The optimal return function V2is convex in θ.Next, we examine the comparative statics of V2 with respect to α2 and σ.Proposition 6The optimal return function V2is non-decreasing in σ and strictly increasing in α2.We employ these results to develop the comparative statics regarding the exit threshold in the innovative product market with respect to σ, stated in the following proposition.Proposition 7If the optimal capacity in market 2, K2, increases with the uncertainty then the exit threshold in market 2 (θE2) decreases in σ.The non-increasing effect of uncertainty on the exit threshold can be explained as follows. When uncertainty is higher, the demand is more volatile. Hence, the firm is less convinced that after it exits, the demand will not pick up and increase again in the, possibly near, future. Therefore, the exit threshold is lower because the firm wants to keep the option alive for longer.Regarding the analysis of the value of the firm, we again have to first establish its convexity in order to present the comparative statics of Proposition 9.Proposition 8The optimal return functionVis convex in θ.The value function of the firmVis increasing in σ and α1, and strictly increasing in α2.This result is intuitive: the value of the firm goes up if α2 increases, since this implies that the output price grows faster after the firm has invested in the innovative technology. The value of the firm also increases in σ because upside potential is unlimited, while downside potential is limited by the output price being positive. The positive effect of α1 on the value of the firm can also be justified: if θ’s trend is larger, then the output price of the established product is expected to decrease at a lower pace.Regarding the comparative statics of the investment and exit threshold of the established product market, we need to resort to numerical analysis. The insights resulting from this analysis are presented in Section 6. Another crucial result regards the point whether the firm will move on by investing in the innovative product or exiting. The next proposition provides an analytical result regarding the probability that the firm will eventually stay active by innovating.Proposition 10The probability that the firm invests rather than exits, i.e. the probability that the threshold θI is hit beforeθE1,is given byPI=(θ1(0)θE1)1−2α1σ2−1(θIθE1)1−2α1σ2−1.When demand is governed by a Brownian motion with drift, like in Kwon (2010), then the expected time to undertake the decision is always infinite (as in this case the process is transient; see, for instance, Ross, 1995). In the case of a geometric Brownian motion, however, the mean exit time from an interval with compact closure is always finite (see, for instance, Lemma IV.2.1 in Bass Richard, 1998).In the next proposition we provide some properties for relevant times, notably expected values and the distribution function for the time in market 2, if the firm decides to invest.Proposition 11The expected time until the firm decides to invest in the innovative product or exit the market (depending on which one occurs first) is given by:E[τ1]=112σ2−α1(ln[θ1(0)θE1]−1−(θ1(0)θE1)1−2α1σ21−(θIθE1)1−2α1σ2ln[θIθE1]),ifα1<12σ2; otherwise it is infinite. If the firm decides to invest in the second market, then the time spent in this market is finite with probability one, with distribution function given by:P(T2<t)=(θE2θI)2λΦ(ln(θE2θI)+μ¯tσt)+Φ(ln(θE2θI)−μ¯tσt),∀t>0forθE2<θI,whereμ¯=α2−σ22,λ=μ¯σ2,and Φ denotes the distribution function of a standard normal distribution. Moreover, the expected time in the second market is equal to:E[T2]=ln[θIθE2]12σ2−α2,ifα2<12σ2; otherwise it is infinite. Furthermore, the expected time that the firm will stay in production is equal toE[τ2]=ln[θIθE2]12σ2−α2((θ1(0)θE1)1−2α1σ2−1(θIθE1)1−2α1σ2−1)+112σ2−α1(ln[θ1(0)θE1]−1−(θ1(0)θE1)1−2α1σ21−(θIθE1)1−2α1σ2ln[θIθE1]).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The paper studies a setting where a firm, currently operating in a declining established product market, has the option to invest and produce a new innovative product. We also include options to exit before and after the innovative investment.The investment decision involves deciding about timing and about capacity size. In general the connection is that later timing implies investing in a market with higher output price, where it results in a larger optimal capacity size upon investment. We find that investment timing is leading where capacity size adjusts, in case we vary growth of the innovative product market. Consider a situation where the innovative product market is expected to grow faster. At first sight one would think this calls for a larger capacity. However, it turns out capacity will be smaller because the firm invests sooner in a market with larger growth.With uncertainty it is the other way round. If capacity size is fixed, Kwon (2010) and Matomaki (2013) found that the effect of uncertainty on the investment threshold is ambiguous. We numerically show that introducing the capacity decision results in monotonicity where the investment threshold always goes up when the economic environment becomes more uncertain. This is caused by the fact that larger uncertainty calls for a larger capacity level, which gives an incentive for the firm to invest later, meaning a larger investment threshold. So here investment size is leading where investment timing adjusts.Another characteristic important for the profitability of the new market is the extent to which quantity negatively influences price. If this effect is large, the profitability of the innovative market is low, and the firm invests later in less capacity.This paper is one of the first fruits of a new research agenda that aims to enrich the real options literature, currently mainly focusing on investment timing, by determining also the investment size. Here it is important to assess which part of the decision is leading: timing or size. Another important topic is to include competition (an early contribution is Huisman & Kort, 2015).The considered investment problem that we need to solve for the results of Proposition 1, is a free-boundary problem. Therefore, we need to check not only that the candidate for the value function is indeed the optimal value function, but we also need to check the shape of the continuation region. We prove the result applying a standard procedure to prove solutions of variational inequalities: we start by guessing the shape of the continuation region and then we verify that the V1 function stated in the proposition is indeed the optimal value function. Therefore, we apply the verification theorem (Theorem 10.4.1) of Øksendal (2010), with Oksendal’s ϕ(.), f(.) and g(.) here given by V1(.), Π1(.) andV2(θ,K2)−δK2,respectively. Moreover, we letV=ℜ0+andD=(θE1,θI),and therefore it holds that∂D={θE1,θI}. To prove the optimality we then check conditions (i) through (ix) of Theorem 10.4.1 of Øksendal (2010). These conditions are quite technical. Informally conditions (i) and (v) state that the value function is smooth, condition (ii) characterizes the continuation region and (iv) its boundary. Condition (iii) states that the expected time in the boundary is zero, while conditions (vi) and (vii) define the equations for the value function. Finally conditions (viii) and (ix) characterizes local times. Conditions (iii), (iv), (viii) and (ix) hold trivially because θ follows a geometric Brownian motion. V1(.) is continuously differentiable in ∂D* since we impose the value matching and smooth pasting conditions; Ω is also twice continuously differentiable (∂D*)c, which proves that conditions (i) and (v), related with continuity and smoothness, hold. Similarly, condition (ii) holds by definition of the value function V1 (defined as the maximum) and the continuation region that we propose. Moreover, we introduce the following partial differential operatorL=∂∂t+α1θ∂∂θ+12σ2θ2∂2∂θ2. Since the time-dependence of the return function is only through the discount factore−rt,the infinitesimal generator can be replaced byL=−r+α1θ∂∂θ+12σ2θ2∂2∂θ2.To verify that (vi) and (vii) hold, we consider one case of V1, while for the other cases similar calculations will apply:V1(θ)=θK1(1−η1K1)r−α1−cK1+Fr+A1θβ1+A2θβ2.Therefore condition (vi) holds, sinceLV1(θ)+Π1(θ)≤0onθ∈ℜ0+∖D¯. And condition (vii) holds becauseLV1(θ)+Π1(θ)=0for θ ∈ D.□Follows automatically from the derivation in Section 3.□See Proposition 1 for the case thatF=c=0.□Standard calculations analogous to Proposition 2 lead to the result.□By straightforward derivation, we get(A.1)V2′′(θ)={0,θ≤θE2β4(β4−1)Gθβ4−2,θ>θE2.Hence, as G > 0, the convexity follows.Let μ > 0 and denote by V2(θ, α2) the value function V2 with the dependence on the drift of the process here denoted by α2.(A.2)V2(θ,α2)=supτ˜IEθ2(0)[∫0τ˜e−rtΠ2(θe((α2−σ22)t+σzt))dt],<supτ˜IEθ2(0)[∫0τ˜e−rtΠ2(θe((α2+μ−σ22)t+σzt))dt],(A.3)≤V2(θ,α2+μ),where inequality (A.2) follows from the fact thate((α2−σ22)+σzt)<e((α2+μ−σ22)+σzt)with probability 1 and Π2 is non-decreasing in θ. The inequality is strict sinceθ2(0)>θE2,and thereforeτ˜>0. Moreover, asτ˜is the optimal stopping time for the problem with drift α2 it is suboptimal for the problem with driftα2+μ,which proves inequality (A.3).Concerning the non-decreasing behavior of V2 as a function of the volatility σ, we refer to Ekstrom (2004), page 273, where in a note he refers that for convex contract functions the option price is non-decreasing in the volatility when the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion. This result holds in our case as V2 is convex in θ (see Proposition 5).□In the following we present an auxiliary result that will be used for the proof of Proposition 7.Lemma 1The negative root of the characteristic equation12σ2β(β−1)+α2β−r=0,hereby denotes by β4, increases with σ.Differentiating the quadratic equation w.r.t. σ,(A.4)Q(β)=12σ2β(β−1)+α2β−r=0,and rearranging, leads to(A.5)∂β4∂σ=−∂Q∂σ∂Q∂β|β=β4.The result holds as(A.6)∂Q∂β|β=β4=12σ2(2β4−1)+α2<0(A.7)⇔(A.8)−2α2+σ2−8rσ2+(−2α2+σ2)22σ2<−2α2+σ22σ2,and∂Q∂σ>0.□Proceeding with the proof of Proposition 7, we know that the exit threshold in market 2 is given by(A.9)θE2=(β4β4−1)F(r−α2)r1K2(1−η2K2).We want to show the effect of increasing σ onθE2. Therefore, we calculate the derivative ofθE2w.r.t σ:(A.10)dθE2dσ=[(11−β4)F(r−α2)r1K2(1−η2K2)][(β4′β4−1)+β4(K2′(1−2η2K2)K2(1−η2K2))],where it is easy to see that the first part of the right hand side is positive. Therefore, the sign depends on the second term, which we denote by I, i.e.(A.11)I:=(−β4′1−β4)+β4(K2′(1−2η2K2)K2(1−η2K2)).Given thatK2<12η2(this holds becauseK2=12η2maximizes the revenue stream, so taking into account investment cost will result in a lower optimal K2 level) and∂K2∂σ>0,it holds that I < 0. This means thatdθE2dσ<0.□First we note that the profit function, Π1(.), is a convex function in θ.In a next step, we defineF(ξ1)=IE[∫0τe−rtΠ1(θ1(t))dt|θ1(0)=ξ1].Then F(.) is a convex function in ξ1 by the same reasoning that we used for equality (A.1).Finally, taking into account that the maximization of V2 over K2 preserves the convexity of the function, as well as the maximum and the sum of two convex functions, thenV(ξ1)=supτ˜IEξ1[∫0τ˜e−rtΠ1(θ1(t))dt+e−rτ˜max{0,maxK2(V2(θ1(τ˜),K2)−δK2)}],is also a convex function.□By Proposition 6, V2 is strictly increasing in α2, and since α2 affects only market 2,Vis also strictly increasing in α2.Denote byV(ξ1,α1)the value functionVwith the dependence on the drift of the process in market 1, here denoted by α1. Let μ > 0 (satisfyingα1+μ<α2) andτ˜(α1)be a stopping time adapted to the geometric Brownian motion with drift α1. Then(A.12)V(ξ1,α1)=supτ˜(α1)IEξ1[∫0τ˜(α1)e−rtΠ1(ξ1e((α1−σ22)t+σzt))dt+e−rτ˜(α1)max{0,maxK2(V2(θ(τ˜(α1)),α2)−δK2)}](A.13)≤supτ˜(α1)IEξ1[∫0τ˜(α1)e−rtΠ1(ξ1e((α1+μ−σ22)t+σzt))dt+e−rτ˜(α1)max{0,maxK2(V2(θ(τ˜(α1))eμτ˜(α1),α2)−δK2)}](A.14)≤V(ξ1,α1+μ),where in (A.13) we use the fact that Π1 is non-decreasing and that V2 is non-decreasing in the initial valueθ(τ˜(α1))because Π2 is also non-decreasing in θ. Finally in (A.14) the sub-optimality ofτ˜(α1)is used.In order to prove the behavior ofVas a function of σ, we follow the ”interesting consequence” of Theorem 4 of Alvarez (2003). Considerd(x)=(r−α2)x,which is an increasing function onℜ+; then all the conditions of Theorem 4 of Alvarez (2003) are satisfied.Letν(ξ1)=Eξ1[e−rτ˜f(θ(τ˜))],where in our case f denotes the return of stopping atτ˜(which includes the return of max {0, V2}). Since max {0, V2} is non-decreasing in σ, as proved before, we conclude based on Theorem 4 of Alvarez (2003) thatVis a non-decreasing function of the volatility parameter σ.□Let θ1(t) denote the demand level at time t, with t < τ1. Therefore it follows that θ1(t) is given by:θ1(t)=θ1(0)exp{(α1−σ22)t+σW(t)}.We wish to have θ1(t) > θIbeforeθ1(t)<θE1:θ1(t)>θI⇔z(t)>1σln(θIθ1(0))−1σ(α1−σ22)t,θ1(t)<θE1⇔z(t)<1σln(θE1θ1(0))−1σ(α1−σ22)t.By Theorem 4.1 of Anderson (1960), we have that if {Y(t), t} is a Wiener Process, ifγ1>0,γ2<0,δ1=δ2≠0,then the probability thatY(t)≥γ1+δ1tfor a smaller t than any t for whichY(t)≤γ2+δ2tis:PI=e−2γ2δ1−1e2(γ1−γ2)δ1−1.For our case we have thatγ1=1σln(θIθ1(0))>0,γ2=1σln(θE1θ1(0))<0.δ1=−1σ(α1−σ22).Therefore:e−2γ2δ1=exp{ln(θE1θ1(0))(2α1σ2−1)}=(θE1θ1(0))2α1σ2−1,e2(γ1−γ2)δ1=exp{−ln(θIθ1(0)/θE1θ1(0))(2α1σ2−1)}=(θE1θI)2α1σ2−1.SoPI=(θ1(0)θE1)1−2α1σ2−1(θIθE1)1−2α1σ2−1.□In order to prove the expression for the expected time spent in market 1, that we denote by E[τ1], we use the example in Section 10.9 of Wilmott (2006), with A given by α1 and B given by σ2, as the region Ω in our case is just the interval[θE1,θI](a time homogeneous region). The distribution function and the corresponding expected time in market 2, P(T2 < t) and E[T2] respectively, are standard results for the geometric Brownian motion (see, for instance, Ross, 1995). Finally, asτ2=τ1+{T2ifthefirmdecidedtoinvestinthesecondmarket,0ifthefirmdecidedtoexitthefirstmarket,thenE[τ2]=E[τ1]+E[T2]PI. Therefore, the result follows from the probability of investment derived in the previous proposition and from the previous expressions regarding the expected times in the first market and in the second market.□First, we will prove that the optimal capacity for the benchmark model as presented in Eq. (23) is increasing in the volatility parameter σ.Denotinga=4η2(r−α2)K1(1−η1K1)r−α1andb=2η2,we have(A.15)K2=K2(σ)=1+1+a(β12−1)b(β1+1),where β1 depends on σ. In order to ease the notation, we omit dependencies in σ in the following.The derivative of K2 with respect to σ is given by∂K2∂σ=[1+a(β12−1)]−12aβ1β1′(β1+1)−β1′(1+1+a(β12−1)(β1+1)2,whereβ1′is the short-hand notation for the first order derivative of β1 (with respect to σ).As the denominator of∂K2∂σis positive, we proceed to analyze the sign of the numerator, which we can re-write as followsf(σ)=aβ1′β1[1+a(β12−1)]−12(β1+1)−β1′(1+1+a(β12−1))=β1′[aβ1(β1+1)1+a(β12−1)−(1+1+a(β12−1))].Asβ1′<0(see Dixit and Pindyck, 1994, Chapter 5), it follows that f(σ) ≥ 0 if and only ifaβ1(β1+1)1+a(β12−1)−(1+1+a(β12−1))<0,aβ1(β1+1)1+a(β12−1)−1−1+a(β12−1)<0,aβ1(β1+1)−1+a(β12−1)−(1+a(β12−1))<0,(β1+1)2a(a−1)<0.In order for this inequality to hold, it needs to hold that a < 1, which is equivalent to have(A.16)K1(1−η1K1)r−α1<14η2(r−α2).This condition has to hold in order for θIin Eq. (24) to be an admissible solution.Using a similar procedure, we next prove that the investment threshold, θI, is also increasing in σ. The investment threshold can be stated as a function of K2 as follows:θI(K2)=(β1β1−1)[δK2K2(1−η2K2)r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1].Note that(β1β1−1)is increasing in σ (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994). Therefore, we just need to prove that the second part of the right hand side of Eq. (A.17) is also increasing in σ. Due to the previous result that∂K2∂σ>0holds, it remains to show that h(K2) is increasing in K2. So leth(K2)=δK2K2(1−η2K2)r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1.The derivative with respect to K2 is equal to(A.17)(K2(1−η2K2)r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1)−K2[(1−2η2K2)r−α2](K2(1−η2K2)r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1)2.As the denominator is always positive, h(.) increases in K2 if and only if:η2K22r−α2−K1(1−η1K1)r−α1>0.In the following we show that this condition always holds. To simplify notation we setX=K1(1−η1K1)r−α1andY=14η2(r−α2). Note that X < Y holds. Therewith, condition (A.18) can be rewritten as(A.18)1+1+(β12−1)XY>(β1+1)XY.Straightforward calculations show that condition (A.18) is equivalent to X < Y.□Considering the expressions for K2 and θIin Eqs. (23) and (24), trivial computations show that both are decreasing in α2.It is clear from the expression of θI(Eq. (24)) that the investment threshold is increasing in η2. With respect to the dependence of K2 on η2 we derive:(A.19)∂K2∂η2=(β12−1)K1(r−α2)(1−η1K1)(1+β1)(r−α1)η21+4(β12−1)(r−α2)η2K1(1−η1K1)(r−α1)−1+1+4(β12−1)(r−α2)η2K1(1−K1η1)(r−α1)2η22(1+β1).We want to show that∂K2∂η2<0. Multiplying∂K2∂η2by the strictly positive termA=1+4(β12−1)(r−α2)η2K1(1−η1K1)(r−α1),gives(A.20)A∂K2∂η2=−1+2(β12−1)(r−α2)η2K1(1−η1K1)(r−α1)+1+4(β12−1)(r−α2)η2K1(1−η1K1)(r−α1)2(1+β1)η22,which is negative for the considered parameter ranges.□
