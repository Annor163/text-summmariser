@&#ABSTRACT@&#
With respect to multiple attribute group decision making (MADM) problems in which attribute values take the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers, some new group decision making methods are developed. Firstly, some operational laws, expected value, score function and accuracy function of intuitionistic linguistic numbers are introduced. Then, an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized weighted average (ILPGWA) operator and an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted average (ILPGOWA) operator are developed. Furthermore, some desirable properties of the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, etc. are studied. At the same time, some special cases of the generalized parameters in these operators are analyzed. Based on the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators, two approaches to multiple attribute group decision making with intuitionistic linguistic information are proposed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approaches and to demonstrate their practicality and effectiveness.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems are the important research parts of decision theory. Since the object things are fuzzy and uncertain, the attributes involved in the decision problems are not always expressed as crisp numbers, and some of them are more suitable to be denoted by fuzzy numbers, such as interval number, linguistic variable, intuitionistic fuzzy number etc. Since the fuzzy set theory, which was proposed by Zadeh [1], has been a rapid development and a wide range of applications [2–4]. However, the fuzzy set is used to character the fuzziness just by membership degree. Atanassov [5,6] proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function, which is a generalization of the concept of fuzzy set. Obviously, the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) can describe and character the fuzzy essence of the objective world more exquisitely [5], and it has received more and more attention since its appearance. Later, Atanassov and Gargov [7], Atanassov [8] further introduced the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS), and Xu [9], Wang [10] proposed the decision-making methods based on IVIFS. Shu, Cheng and Chang [11] gave the definition of the intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number, and Zhang and Liu [12] defined the triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number, and they proposed the relevant decision making methods separately. Wang [13] gave the definition of intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number and interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number, then some decision making methods based on the intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number had been proposed [14–18]. Furthermore, Wang and Li [19] proposed intuitionistic linguistic sets, intuitionistic linguistic numbers, intuitionistic two-semantics and the Hamming distance between two intuitionistic two-semantics, and rank the alternatives by calculating the comprehensive membership degree to the ideal solution for each alternative.The information aggregation operators are an interesting research topic, which is receiving increasing concern. Yager [20] proposed the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator which is an extension of the OWA operator. Li [21], Zhao et al. [22] further proposed the generalized aggregation operators for intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Merigó and Casanovas [23] presented the generalized hybrid averaging (GHA) operator. It is able to generalize a wide range of mean operators such as the HA, the hybrid geometric averaging (HGA), the hybrid quadratic averaging (HQA), the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator and the weighted generalized mean (WGM). A key feature in GHA operator is that it is able to deal with the weighted average and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator in the same formulation. Merigó and Casanovas [24] introduced the fuzzy generalized hybrid averaging (FGHA) operator for the multi-attribute decision-making problems in which the attribute values take the form of the fuzzy number; this expanded the application scope of GHA operator. However, most of the existing aggregation operators do not consider the relationship between the values being aggregated. Yager [25] proposed a power-average (PA) operator and a power OWA (POWA) operator, which weighting vectors depend on the input data and allow values being fused to support and reinforce each other. Xu and Yager [26] developed a power-geometric (PG) operator, a power-ordered-geometric (POG) operator and a power-ordered-weighted-geometric (POWG) operator, and studied some properties of these operators. Then, an uncertain PG (UPG) operator and its weighted form, and an uncertain power-ordered-weighted-geometric (UPOWG) operator are proposed to aggregate the input arguments taking the form of interval values, and the approaches to group decision making are developed based on these operators. Xu [27] developed a series of operators for aggregating the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, and studied various properties of these power aggregation operators, and then some approaches to multiple attribute group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information were proposed. Xu and Wang [28] developed some linguistic aggregation operators, included 2-tuple linguistic power average (2TLPA) operator, 2-tuple linguistic weighted power average (2TLWPA) operator, and 2-tuple linguistic power-ordered-weighted average (2TLPOWA) operator, then studied some properties of these operators, such as idempotency, boundary, etc. Moreover, two approaches to deal with group decision making problems under linguistic environment were developed. Zhou et al. [29] proposed a generalized power ordered weighted average (GPOWA) operator, an uncertain generalized power average (UGPA) operator, an uncertain generalized power ordered weighted average (UGPOWA) operator, an generalized intuitionistic fuzzy power averaging (GIFPA) operator and the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy power ordered weighted averaging (GIFPOWA) operator. Moreover, some properties of these operators are studied and the new approaches on the basis of the proposed operators were developed for the MADM problems. Xu et al. [30] proposed the linguistic power average (LPA) operator, the linguistic weighted PA operator, the LPOWA operator, the uncertain linguistic weighted PA operator, and the ULPOWA operator. Then some approaches, which are based on ULWPA and ULPOWA operators, were developed to solve group decision-making problems under an uncertain linguistic environment.The intuitionistic linguistic variables are very suitable to be used for depicting uncertain or fuzzy information, and the existing methods based on intuitionistic linguistic variables do not consider the relationships of the aggregated arguments. Motivated by the idea of power aggregation operator proposed by Yager [25] and the generalized aggregation operators proposed by Yager [20] and Zhao et al. [22], this paper is to propose some operators, such as an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized weighted average (ILPGWA) operator and an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted average (ILPGOWA) operator. They can not only provide the generalized aggregation functions, but also provide the power aggregation functions which consider the relationships of the aggregated arguments. Furthermore, some desirable properties of the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, are studied, and some special cases of these operators are analyzed. To do this, the structure of this paper is shown as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review some basic concepts of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, linguistic variables, intuitionistic linguistic variables, GOWA operator, and power operators. Section 3 proposes an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized weighted average (ILPGWA) operator and an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted average (ILPGOWA) operator, some desirable properties and special cases of these operators are discussed. In Section 4, we develop two methods for multi-criteria group decision making based on the proposed operators. Section 5 gives an example to illustrate the decision steps and discusses the influence of different parameters on the decision-making results, and compare with existing method. In Section 6, we give the conclusions and future research directions.Definition 1[5,6]An IFS A in X is given by(1)A={<x,uA(x),vA(x)>x∈X}where uA:X→[0, 1] andvA:X→[0,1], meet the condition0≤uA(x)+vA(x)≤1, ∀x∈X. The numbers uA(x) and vA(x) represent the membership degree and non-membership degree of the element x to the set A, respectively. Furthermore,π(x)=1−uA(x)−vA(x)is called a hesitancy degree of x to the set A. It is obvious that 0≤π(x)≤1, ∀x∈X.In addition, we can call each two-tuple(uA(x),vA(x))an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), and for convenience, denoted an IFN bya=(ua,va), whereua,va≥0,ua+va≤1.Leta=(ua,va)andb=(ub,vb)be two IFNs and λ≥0, then the operations of IFNs are defined as follows [5,9](2)a+b=(ua+ub−uaub,vavb)(3)a⊗b=(uaub,va+vb−vava)(4)λa=(1−(1−ua)λ,(vA)λ)(5)aλ=((ua)λ,1−(1−va)λ)Suppose that S=(s0, s1, …, sl−1) is a finite and totally ordered discrete term set, where l is the odd value. In real situation, l is equal to 3, 5, 7, 9 etc. For example, when l=9, a set S could be given as follows:S=(s0,s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8)={extremely poor, very poor, poor, slightly poor, fair, slightly good, good, very good, extremely good}.Usually, for any linguistic set S, it is required that siand sjmust satisfy the following additional characteristics [31,32]:(1)The set is ordered: si≺sj, if and only if i<j;There is the negation operator: neg(si)=sl−1−i;Maximum operator: max(si, sj)=si, ifi≥j;Minimum operator: min(si, sj)=si, ifi≤j;Furthermore, in order to preserve all the given information, Herrera et al. [31] proposed that the discrete linguistic label S=(s0, s1, …, sl−1) is extended to a continuous linguistic labelS¯={sα|α∈R}which satisfied the above characteristics.For any linguistic variablessi,sj∈S¯, the operations are defined as follows [33,34]:(6)(1)βsi=sβ×i,β≥0(7)(2)si⊕sj=si+j(8)(3)sisj=si/j(9)(4)(si)n=sin,n≥0(10)(5)λ(si⊕sj)=λsi⊕sj,λ≥0(11)(6)(λ1+λ2)si=λ1si⊕λ2si,λ1,λ2≥0Definition 2[19]An ILS A in X is defined as(12)A={<x[hθ(x),(uA(x),vA(x))]>|x∈X}wherehθ(x)∈S¯, uA:X→[0, 1] andvA:X→[0,1], with the condition0≤uA(x)+vA(x)≤1, ∀x∈X. The numbers uA(x) and vA(x) represent, respectively, the membership degree and non-membership degree of the element x to linguistic index hθ(x).For each ILS A in X, ifπ(x)=1−uA(x)−vA(x), ∀x∈X, then π(x) is called a hesitancy degree of x to linguistic index hθ(x). It is obvious that 0≤π(x)≤1, ∀x∈X.Definition 3[19]LetA={<x[hθ(x),(uA(x),vA(x))]>|x∈X}be ILS, the ternary group〈hθ(x),(uA(x),vA(x))〉is called an intuitionistic linguistic number, and A can also be viewed as a collection of the intuitionistic linguistic number (ILN). So, it can also be expressed asA={<hθ(x),(uA(x),vA(x))>|x∈X}. In addition,πA(x)=1−uA(x)−vA(x)represents the hesitancy degree, and it can also be called the intuitionistic linguistic fuzzy degree. For convenience, denoted an ILN bya˜=〈sθ(a),(u(a),v(a))〉, whereu(a),v(a)≥0,u(a)+v(a)≤1.Leta˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉anda˜2=〈sθ(a2),(u(a2),v(a2))〉be two ILNs and λ≥0, then the operations of ILNs are defined as follows [19](13)a˜1+a˜2=〈sθ(a1)+θ(a2),(1−(1−u(a1))(1−u(a2)),v(a1)v(a2))〉(14)a˜1⊗a˜2=〈sθ(a1)×θ(a2),(u(a1)u(a2),v(a1)+v(a2)−v(a1)v(a2))〉(15)λa˜1=〈sλ×θ(a1),(1−(1−u(a1))λ,(v(a1))λ)〉(16)a˜1λ=〈s(θ(a1))λ,((u(a1))λ,1−(1−v(a1))λ)〉Definition 4Leta˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉be an ILN, an expected valueE(a˜1)ofa˜1can be represented as follows(17)E(a˜1)=12×(u(a1)+1−v(a1))×sθ(a1)=s(θ(a1)×(u(a1)+1−v(a1)))/2whereE(a˜1)∈[0,sθ(a1)].Leta˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉be an ILN, a score functionS(a˜1)of an ILNa˜1can be represented as follows(18)S(a˜1)=E(a˜1)×(u(a1)−v(a1))whereE(a˜1)is the expected value of the ILNa˜1.Leta˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉be an ILN, an accuracy functionH(a˜1)of an ILNa˜1can be represented as follows(19)H(a˜1)=E(a˜1)×(u(a1)+v(a1))whereE(a˜1)is the expected value of an ILNa˜1.Ifa˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉anda˜2=〈sθ(a2),(u(a2),v(a2))〉are any two ILNs, then,(1)IfE(a˜1)>E(a˜2), then,a˜1≻a˜2IfE(a˜1)=E(a˜2), thenIfS(a˜1)>S(a˜2), then,a˜1≻a˜2;IfE(a˜1)=E(a˜2)andS(a˜1)=S(a˜2), thenifH(a˜1)>H(a˜2), then,a˜1≻a˜2;ifH(a˜1)=H(a˜2), then,a˜1=a˜2.Leta˜1=〈sθ(a1),(u(a1),v(a1))〉anda˜2=〈sθ(a2),(u(a2),v(a2))〉are any two ILNs, then the normalized Hamming distance betweena˜1anda˜2is defined as follows:(20)d(a˜1,a˜2)=12(l−1)(1+u(a1)−v(a1))θ(a1)−(1+u(a2)−v(a2))θ(a2)Definition 9A GOWA operator of dimension n is a mapping GOWA: Rn→R. Such that,(21)GOWA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑j=1nωjbjλ1/λwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis a weight vector which is correlative with GOWA, satisfying ωj∈[0, 1] (j=1, 2, …, n) and∑j=1nωj=1; bjis the jth largest of real numbers ak(k=1, 2, …, n). λ is a parameter such that λ∈(−∞, 0)∪(0, +∞).A power average (PA) operator which is introduced by Yager [25] can be defined as follows:(22)PA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑i=1n(1+T(ai))ai∑i=1n(1+T(ai))where(23)T(ai)=∑j=1j≠inSup(ai,aj)and Sup(a, b) is considered as the support for a from b, which satisfies the following properties.(1) Sup(a, b)∈[0, 1].(2) Sup(a, b)=Sup(b, a).(3)Sup(a,b)≥Sup(x,y),ifa−b<x−y.Yager [25] also defined a POWA operator shown as follows:(24)POWA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑i=1nuiaindex(i)whereui=gRiTV−gRi−1TV,Ri=∑j=1iVindex(j),g:[0,1]→[0,1] is a basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function which satisfies the following properties.(1) g(0)=0; (2) g(1)=1; (3) g(x)≥g(y), if x>y.(25)TV=∑i=1nVindex(i),Vindex(i)=1+T(aindex(i))T(aindex(i)) denotes the support of the ith largest argument by all the other arguments, i.e.,(26)T(aindex(i))=∑j=1j≠inSup(aindex(i),aindex(j))where Sup(aindex(i), aindex(j)) indicates the support of jth largest argument for the ith largest argument.Definition 10Leta˜j=〈sθ(a˜j),(u(a˜j),v(a˜j))〉(j=1,2,…,n)be a collection of the ILNs, and ILPGA:Ωn→Ω, if(27)ILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λwhere Ω is the set of all intuitionistic linguistic numbers, andT(a˜j)=∑i=1i≠jnSup(a˜j,a˜i), λ is a parameter such that λ∈(0, +∞), then IPLGA is called the intuitionistic linguistic power generalized aggregation operator.The ILPGA operator satisfies the following properties:Let(a′˜1,a′˜2,…,a′˜n)be any permutation of(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n), thenILPGA(a′˜1,a′˜2,…,a′˜n)=ILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)LetILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λILPGA(a′˜1,a′˜2,…,a′˜n)=∑j=1n(1+T(a′˜j))a′˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a′˜j))1/λSince(a′˜1,a′˜2,…,a′˜n)is any permutation of(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n), we have∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))=∑j=1n(1+T(a′˜j)),∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ=∑j=1n(1+T(a′˜j))a′˜jλthusILPGA(a′˜1,a′˜2,…,a′˜n)=ILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n).□Leta˜j=a˜,j=1,2,…,n, thenILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=a˜Sincea˜j=a˜, for all j, we haveILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,⋯,a˜n)=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜λ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=a˜λ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=(a˜λ)1/λ=a˜□The ILPGA operator lies between the max and min operators:min(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤ILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤max(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)Leta˜=min(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n),b˜=max(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n).Sincea˜≤a˜j≤b˜, then∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜λ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ≤∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ≤∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))b˜λ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λThat isa˜≤∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ≤b˜i.e.min(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤ILPGA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤max(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)□.In Eq. (27), we assumed that all of the objects (a1, a2, …, an) being aggregated were of equal importance. However, in many cases, the importance degrees are not equal; thus, we need to assign different weights for different objects. Assume that each object being aggregated has a weight ωi∈[0, 1]. So, we can define a new aggregation operator to process this case.Definition 11Leta˜j=〈sθ(a˜j),(u(a˜j),v(a˜j))〉(j=1,2,…,n)be a collection of the ILNs, and ILPGWA:Ωn→Ω, if(28)ILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λwhere Ω is the set of all intuitionistic linguistic numbers, and ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector ofa˜j(j=1,2,…,n),ωj∈[0,1],∑j=1nωj=1.T(a˜j)=∑i=1i≠jnSup(a˜j,a˜i), λ is a parameter such that λ∈(0, +∞), then ILPGWA is called the intuitionistic linguistic power generalized weighted aggregation operator. Specially, ifω=1n,1n,…,1nT, ILPGWA operator should be ILPGA operator.According to the operation laws of ILNs, formula (28) can be transformed into the following form by using mathematical induction on n:(29)ILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=s∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))(θ(a˜j))λ∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λ,1−∏j=1n(1−u(a˜j)λ)ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λ,1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−v(a˜j))λ)ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λSome properties of the ILPGWA operator are shown as follows.(1) When λ→0,(30)ILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=s∏j=1nθ(a˜j)ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j)),∏j=1nu(a˜j)ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j)),1−∏j=1n(1−v(a˜j))ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))The ILPGWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic linguistic power weighted geometric (ILPWG) operator.(2) When λ=1,(31)ILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=s∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))θ(a˜j)∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j)),1−∏j=1n(1−u(a˜j))ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j)),∏j=1nv(a˜j)ωj(1+T(a˜j))∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))The ILPGWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic linguistic power weighted aggregation (ILPWA) operator.LettingSup(a˜i,a˜j)=k, for all i≠j, thenILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=∑j=1nωja˜jλ1/λwhich indicates that when all the supports are the same, the ILPGWA operator becomes an intuitionistic linguistic generalized weighted average (ILGWA) operator.ifSup(a˜i,a˜j)=k, for all i≠j, thenT(a˜j)=∑i=1i≠jnSup(a˜j,a˜i)=(n−1)kThusILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,⋯,a˜n)=∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1nωj(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=∑j=1nωj(1+(n−1)k)a˜jλ∑j=1nωj(1+(n−1)k)1/λ=∑j=1nωja˜jλ∑j=1nωj1/λ=∑j=1nωja˜jλ1/λ□Similar to Theorems 2 and 3, it can be easily proved that the ILPGWA operator has the following properties:Theorem 5(1, Idempotency)Leta˜j=a˜,j=1,2,…,n, thenILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=a˜The ILPGWA operator lies between the max and min operators:min(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤ILPGWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤max(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)But ILPGWA operator has not the commutativity property.The ILPGWA operator can weight all the given ILNs themselves, and the weighting vectors depend on the input arguments. However, in many decision making problems, we need to consider the weight of the argument positions, for example, diving games in Olympic Games. Base on the POWA operator, we define a new aggregation operator called an intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted averaging (ILPGOWA) operator.Leta˜j=〈sθ(a˜j),(u(a˜j),v(a˜j))〉(j=1,2,…,n)be a collection of the ILNs, and ILPGWA:Ωn→Ω, if(32)ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1nζja˜index(j)λ1/λwhere Ω is the set of all intuitionistic linguistic numbers, andT(a˜j)=∑i=1i≠jnSup(a˜j,a˜i)is an indexing function such thata˜index(j)is the jth largest of the ILNsa˜j(j=1,2,…,n). ζj(j=1, 2, …, n) is a collection of weights such thatζj=gRjTV−gRj−1TV,Rj=∑i=1jVindex(i),(33)TV=∑i=1nVindex(i),Vindex(i)=1+T(a˜index(i))g:[0,1]→[0,1] is a basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function which satisfies the following properties.(1) g(0)=0; (2) g(1)=1; (3) g(x)≥g(y), if x>y.T(aindex(i)) indicates the support of the ith largest argument by all the other arguments, i.e.,(34)T(a˜index(i))=∑k=1k≠inSup(a˜index(i),a˜index(k))λ is a parameter such that λ∈(0, +∞), then ILPGOWA is called the intuitionistic linguistic power generalized ordered weighted aggregation operator.According to the operations of ILNs, formula (32) can be transformed into the following form by using mathematical induction on n:(35)ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=s(ζjθ(a˜indexj)λ)1/λ,1−∏j=1n(1−u(a˜indexj)λ)ζj1/λ,1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−v(a˜indexj))λ)ζj1/λEspecially, if g(x)=x, then the ILPGOWA operator can reduce to the ILPGA operator.ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1nζja˜indexjλ1/λ=∑j=1ngRjTV−gRj−1TVa˜indexjλ1/λ=∑j=1nVindex(j)TVa˜index(j)λ1/λ=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜index(j)))a˜index(j)λ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜index(j)))1/λ=∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))a˜jλ∑j=1n(1+T(a˜j))1/λ=ILPGASo, ILPGA operator is a special case of ILPGOWA operator.□Similar to Theorem 4, we have the following results.Theorem 8LettingSup(a˜i,a˜j)=k, for all i≠j, thenILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=1n∑j=1na˜jλ1/λwhich indicates that when all the supports are the same, the ILPGOWA operator becomes an intuitionistic linguistic generalized average (ILGA) operator.Similar to Theorems 1–3, it can be easily proved that the ILPGOWA operator has the following properties:Theorem 9(1, Commutativity).Leta˜′1,a˜′2,…,a˜′nbe any permutation of(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n), thenILPGOWA(a˜′1,a˜′2,…,a˜′n)=ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)Leta˜j=a˜,j=1,2,…,n, thenILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=a˜The ILPGOWA operator lies between the max and min operators:min(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)≤max(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)Similarly, some special cases of the ILPGOWA operators are shown as follows.(1) When λ→0,(36)ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∏j=1na˜index(j)ζj=s∏j=1nθ(a˜index(j))ζj,∏j=1nu(a˜index(j))ζj,1−∏j=1n1−v(a˜index(j))ζjThe ILPGOWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic linguistic power ordered weighted geometric (ILPOWG) operator.(2) When λ=1,(37)PGOWA(a1,a2,…,an)=ILPGOWA(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)=∑j=1nζja˜indexj=s∑j=1nζjθ(a˜index(j)),1−∏j=1n1−u(a˜index(j))ζj,∏j=1nv(a˜index(j))ζjThe ILPGOWA operator reduces to the ILPOWA operator.Clearly, both the ILPGWA and ILPGOWA operators can consider the given arguments and their relationships; the difference between two operators is that the ILPGWA operator emphasizes their own importance of these arguments, while the ILPGOWA operator stresses their ordered position importance.Usually, in real group decision making problems, some decision-makers may provide unfair evaluation values to some objects. If the evaluation value given by a decision maker is more similar to all the other values provided by the other decision makers, the bigger weight will be assigned; on the contrary, the smaller weight will be assigned. Thus, these operators can reduce the influence of outlier arguments. So, the decision results based on these operators are more reasonable and reliable.Consider a multiple attribute group decision making with intuitionistic linguistic information: let A={A1, A2, …, Am} be a discrete set of alternatives, and C={C1, C2, …, Cn} be the set of attributes, ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weighting vector of the attribute Cj(j=1, 2, …, n), whereωj≥0,j=1,2,…,n,∑j=1nωj=1,. Let D={D1, D2, …, Dp} be the set of decision makers, and γ=(γ1, γ2, …, γp) is the expert weight, withγk≥0(k=1,2,…,p),∑k=1pγk=1. Suppose thatR˜k=r˜ijkm×nis the decision matrix, wherer˜ijk=saijk,(uijk,vijk)takes the form of the intuitionistic linguistic number, given by the decision maker Dk, for alternative Aiwith respect to attribute Cj, and0≤uijk≤1,0≤vijk≤1,uijk+vijk≤1,saijk∈S. Then, the ranking of alternatives is required.In the following, we apply the ILPGWA operator and the ILPGOWA operator to multiple attribute group decision making based on intuitionistic linguistic information.The method involves the following steps:Step 1.Calculate the supports.(38)Sup(r˜ijk,r˜ijl)=1−d(r˜ijk,r˜ijl),k,l=1,2,…,p;i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,nwhich satisfies the support conditions (1)–(3) in

alternatives which are shown as follows.(1)A1 is a car company;A2 is a computer company;A3 is a TV company;A4 is a food company.There are four attributes (suppose that their weight vector is ω=(0.32,
