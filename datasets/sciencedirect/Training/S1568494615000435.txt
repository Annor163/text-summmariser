@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A conventional collaborative beamforming (CB) system suffers from high sidelobes due to the random positioning of the nodes. This paper introduces a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm called the Particle Swarm Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm-Explore (PSOGSA-E) to suppress the peak sidelobe level (PSL) in CB, by the means of finding the best weight for each node. The proposed algorithm combines the local search ability of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) with the social thinking skills of the legacy particle swarm optimization (PSO) and allows exploration to avoid premature convergence. The proposed algorithm also simplifies the cost of variable parameter tuning compared to the legacy optimization algorithms. Simulations show that the proposed PSOGSA-E outperforms the conventional, the legacy PSO, GSA and PSOGSA optimized collaborative beamformer by obtaining better results faster, producing up to 100% improvement in PSL reduction when the disk size is small.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Collaborative beamforming (CB) has been receiving favourable attention in the research community, especially for the energy constrained and throughput gain centred networks [1–5]. In transmit CB, decentralized nodes act as a distributed antenna array and adjust the initial phases of their carriers to form a beam collaboratively towards an intended receiver [1].In many practical scenarios, the collaborating nodes will have random locations, thus forming a random antenna array. The randomness of the nodes’ locations results in high and asymmetrical sidelobes in the sample beampattern [1,6]. High sidelobe is undesirable in a beamformer as it will cause interferences to unintended users.Sidelobe suppression problem has been widely discussed by researchers in the context of centralized antenna array [7–19]. Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) [14], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [17,16,15] and evolutionary algorithm (EA) [18,11,19] are popular approaches that has been undertaken to solve this problem in the past. However, most of these researches exploit the array's geometry to achieve beampattern with reduced sidelobe, whereas position of the nodes in CB scenarios usually cannot be arranged.A node selection algorithm to control the sidelobe in CB has been proposed in [20] but the proposed algorithm is feasible only when large number of nodes is available for collaboration. A collaborative null steering beamformer is presented in [21]. The peak sidelobe (PSL) reduction method in this paper suggests careful positioning of the BS/AP, and does not suit practical scenarios where the nodes’ geometries are fixed. Moreover, it is more desirable to reduce the overall sidelobe value rather than nulling at a certain direction as the directions of unintended users are usually unknown.Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a relatively new nature based optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity [22]. Combination of GSA and PSO has been proposed in [23] and it has been shown that the hybrid of PSO and GSA can provide improved results for general mathematical functions. However, both [22,23] are presented as generic algorithms and has not been specifically applied to solve the problem of sidelobe minimization in CB.This paper proposes a metaheuristic approach called Particle Swarm Optimization-Gravitational Search Algorithm-Explore (PSOGSA-E) to optimize the beampattern of collaborative beamforming. While previous researchers considered optimizing the array geometry, this new version of hybrid GSA and PSO focuses on optimizing the weight vector of the beamformer to achieve lower sidelobes. The proposed technique combines the search method of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) with enhanced exploration ability to achieve lower PSL and is more cost effective to tune compared to the legacy optimization methods.The novel contributions in this paper are as follows:1This is the first time any variant of the metaheuristic algorithm PSOGSA is applied to solve the sidelobe reduction problem in collaborative beamforming.A new and simpler version of PSOGSA called PSOGSA-E is proposed in this paper. Only one parameter need to be tuned in this proposed version as compared to at least three parameters in the legacy PSO and PSOGSA.The proposed algorithm utilizes both exploration and exploitation to find the global optimum and successfully avoids the problem of premature convergence.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. System models and the objective function of the problem are introduced in Section 3. Section 2.2 discusses the recent works in the field of beampattern optimization in CB and also the existing hybrid PSOGSA algorithms. Section 4 details the flow of PSO, GSA and the PSOGSA. The proposed PSOGSA-E algorithm is explained in detail in Section 5. The performance of the proposed technique is studied in Section 6. This is finally followed by conclusions in Section 7.
