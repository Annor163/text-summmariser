In this paper a new technique for the extraction of respiratory signal from the single-lead ECG using generalized homomorphic filtering is presented. It is proposed to perform band pass filtering on the cepstrum of the ECG signal to extract the respiratory signal. For this study, transforms used in generalized homomorphic filtering are the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The performance of the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal obtained using the proposed method is compared with the reference respiratory signal in terms of the correlation, magnitude squared coherence coefficients and breath rate accuracy. It is observed from the comparisons that the EDR technique based on generalized homomorphic filtering using DFT performs better than the homomorphic filtering using DCT. The proposed EDR technique is also compared with the two well-known EDR techniques: principal component analysis and R peak amplitude algorithm. It is seen from the results that the proposed EDR technique (RDFT) performs significantly better than the R peak amplitude algorithm, but significant improvements are not observed when compared with the PCA based EDR technique.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Respiratory signal is measured using inductive plethysmograph, spirometer and impedance pneumograph. During the respiration process, some morphological changes in the ECG signal arise due to some mechanisms such as: i) the volume of lung changes during inspiration and expiration which causes change in electric impedance of thorax [1], and ii) changes in the heart vector with respect to ECG electrodes [2]. These changes in the ECG signal occur due to the respiration process which can be separated using appropriate signal processing techniques. Thus, extraction of the respiratory signal from the ECG is called ECG derived respiration (EDR). Extraction of the respiratory signal from the ECG signal provides facility of simultaneous study of cardiac activity and the respiration, as it reduces the cost of healthcare system. Moreover, looking for the derived respiratory signal from the ECG provides the benefit of not interfering with natural breathing and noise.A wide range of the EDR algorithms have been developed in the last twenty years. The EDR technique based on amplitude demodulation of the ECG signal was proposed in [3]. The single-lead EDR algorithms to identify the beat-to-beat amplitude variation of the QRS complex or T wave to monitor the respiratory signal are discussed in [4–6]. These techniques are associated with the variations in the thoracic impedance due to the respiration process. The EDR techniques proposed in [4–6] are suitable to study beat to beat variations but are not robust in case of noisy ECG signals because noise directly affects amplitude of the R peaks of the ECG signal. Filtering of ECG signals in predefine respiratory frequency band is also a well-known technique to extract the respiratory signal from the ECG [7–9]. The filtering techniques for extraction of the respiratory signal from the ECG are not suitable when respiratory frequency lies outside the predefined respiratory frequency band. It is seen from previous studies that the filtering techniques are more efficient in noisy environment as compared to other EDR techniques. [8]. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique to derive the respiratory signal from the ECG is proposed in [10]. The DWT technique is computationally viable but this technique is not good to retain the actual shape of respiratory signal because shape of the extracted respiratory signal strongly depends on used mother wavelet. Also, the performance of the DWT based EDR technique decreases as respiration rate decreases [8]. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique is being used into a number of applications and it has also emerged as a tool for time-frequency analysis. The EMD technique is a data driven technique with high computational cost which determines the oscillatory modes present in the signal and it has been used to monitor the respiratory signal from the ECG in [10,11]. Recently, Langley et al. [12] introduced principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain beat-to-beat variation in the ECG signal and extracted the respiratory signal on the concept of maximum variability with the assumption of linear relation between the respiratory signal and the ECG signal. The improved form of PCA is proposed by Widjaja et al. [13] as Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to deal with non-linearity between the ECG and respiratory signals in order to overcome the drawback of linear PCA. In the KPCA technique, optimization of the unknown parameter (sigma) of used kernel function and effect of noise (present in the ECG signal) on the derived respiratory signal are still difficult to analyze.Homomorphic filtering is a well-known technique for signal and image processing, involving a nonlinear mapping to a different domain in which the linear filter techniques are applied, followed by mapping back to the original domain [14]. In this paper, a new technique for the extraction of respiratory signal from the single-lead ECG using generalized homomorphic filtering is proposed. The main motivation for using the homomorphic filtering as EDR technique stems from the assumption that the ECG signal is generated from the convolution of electrical signals of heart activities and the transfer function of a LTI system which is influenced by the respiratory process. In this paper, we will address the homomorphic filtering approach that de-convolves the ECG components in order to separate the respiratory signal.The rest of the paper is organized as follow: a brief overview of the homomorphic filtering technique is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, the methodology and assessment of the performance of the different EDR algorithms are presented. The comparison of results of the proposed technique with the existing EDR methods is provided in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.In many signal processing applications, the homomorphic filtering technique is used to remove multiplicative noise from the signal [14,15]. The concept used in homomorphic filtering is to transform convolved components of a given signal into additive form where linear filtering can be applied to separate the desired signal components. The block diagram representation of homomorphic filtering is shown inFig. 1 which shows the basic steps involved in the homomorphic filtering technique [14].The block diagram for de-convolution of the input signal in its components is shown in Fig. 1(a). Let us assume a signals(n)which is generated through the convolution of two componentss1(n)ands2(n), i.e.,s(n)=s1(n)⊗s2(n), where⊗denotes convolution operator. The characteristic functionD(.), shown in Fig. 1(b), conveys the property(1)D[as1(n)⊗bs2(n)]=aD[s1(n)]+bD[s2(n)],whereaandbare scalars and the systemD(.)is invertible. It can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the signal is first transformed in the Fourier domain using the discrete Fourier transform where convolution becomes multiplication and then logarithmic function is applied followed by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). These steps are used to transform multiplicative components of the signal into additive form into log domain so that the linear operations can be applied. The output of the characteristic systemD(.)is called complex cepstrums^(n)which is input for the linear system.The homomorphic system passes the desired signal unaltered but it removes undesired components of the signal with the help of some linear operations. Therefore, the characteristic functionD(.)is applied to the signals(n)to remove the undesired signal components using the linear filtering techniques. Thus, we can writes(n)as(2)s(n)=s1(n)⊗s2(n).(3)s^(n)=D{s(n)}=s^1(n)+s^2(n).If the given input signals(n)to the characteristic systemD(.)is real than the complex cepstrums^(n)at the output is also real. It can be seen from (3) that the signal components appear in additive form in log domain where the linear systemLcan be applied to separate undesired signal components from the composite. Hence, output of the linear system can be represented as(4)y^(n)=L{s^1(n)+s^2(n)}=y^1(n)+y^2(n).For a given input sequences(n), DFT may have large number of zeros at the origin which shift the phase by large amount. To retain the information of interest, linear phase shift needs to remove before getting complex cepstrums^(n). The signal obtained at the output of linear system has to retain in its original form and this is carried out by first applying discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the signaly^(n)and then exponential operation followed by the IDFT which provides the required signal at the output. Thus, the output of inverse homomorphic de-convolution can be written as(5)y(n)=D−1{y^1(n)+y^2(n)}=y1(n)⊗y2(n).Hence, we can separate required components from the input signals(n)using the homomorphic de-convolution. In case of the ECG signal as input to the homomorphic filtering, it is possible to separate the respiratory component from the ECG by using the homomorphic filtering technique because it is assumed that the ECG signal is convolved output of electric signals of heart activities and the transfer function of a LTI system which is influenced by respiratory process then.
