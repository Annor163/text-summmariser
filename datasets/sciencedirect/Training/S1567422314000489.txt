@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Google has been steadily increasing its market share in the US, although its main competitor, Yahoo, began developing a successful knowledge-sharing service in 2005. To verify whether a knowledge-sharing service may increase a search engine’s competitiveness, this study considers the competition between an inferior search engine that has an option of introducing a knowledge-sharing service and a superior search engine without this service. We specifically investigate the conditions under which it would be more profitable for the inferior search engine to introduce a knowledge-sharing service rather than increase its search quality. We show that the inferior search engine’s profit-maximizing strategy mainly depends on both the amount of information available on the Internet and the difference in search quality between it and the superior search engine. When the search quality difference is small, the inferior search engine should introduce a knowledge-sharing service keeping its answer database inaccessible to the superior search engine. When the search quality difference is large, the inferior search engine generally had better improve its search technology. We also show the inferior search engine’s market-share-maximizing strategy when it introduces a knowledge-sharing service.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Knowledge-sharing websites connect online users with questions and those who can answer the questions. As adopted by Kim and Tse (2011), the former group is referred to as questioners and the latter group as answerers. Questioners post their questions and wait for replies from answerers. This process is especially valuable if questioners fail to obtain the information they seek from search engines. Online users may also find answers to their questions by searching an answer database that stores pre-answered questions.Answerers may participate in knowledge-sharing services due to various reasons. They may want to help questioners find relevant information, learn about particular topics of their interests, or generate certain demands for their businesses (Nam et al. 2009). The answerers’ motivation of promoting their businesses here implies knowledge-sharing services can be online channels of their sales. Some answerers participating in a leading knowledge-sharing service (called Knowledge-In) in South Korea tried to capture potential customers of their insurance sales by answering their questions (Nam et al. 2009). Many other businesses are also possible via knowledge-sharing services. Car salesmen, private hospital doctors, and restaurant owners may obtain customers by providing them with relevant information. In addition, answerers may receive monetary rewards in return for their answering services. Some knowledge-sharing websites such as Mahalo Answers, Just Answers, and UClue provide pay-for-answer services (Hsieh et al. 2010).1While anyone can answer on Mahalo Answers, Just Answers and UClue recruit answerers.1These websites thus serve as online platforms via which experts can sell their knowledge.Many search engines have been successful in obtaining a huge number of these answerers (as well as questioners) for their knowledge-sharing services. In the US, Yahoo’s knowledge-sharing service, Yahoo! Answers, has been successful since its beta launch in December 2005.2“Yahoo! Search Leverages Human Knowledge from Yahoo! Answers to Improve Web Search; Yahoo! Answers Surpasses 10 Million Answers to Everyday Questions from Real People.” Business Wire, May 15, 2006, http://search.proquest.com/docview/445231173?accountid=14558 (accessed November 5, 2013).2As of January 2011, Yahoo! Answers had about 48 million monthly users in the US.3Kiss, Jemima. ”In Focus: Technology: How Q&A Web Brands Rose to be the Hottest Properties on the Net in 2011: Quora, Set up by Two Ex-Facebookers, has become the Darling of Silicon Valley (and Ashton Kutcher is a Fan Too).

Among these, Naver’s Knowledge-In has been very successful, contributing to the success of Naver,4Sang-hun Choe, “South Koreans Connect through Search Engine,” The New York Times (accessed October 20, 2013).4which leads the Korean search engine market.To a certain extent, Naver’s knowledge-sharing service has induced Korean users to use Naver by making its answer database closed (i.e., inaccessible to other search engines). Given that most Koreans search for information on the Internet in Korean, its closed answer database has become a valuable tool to Korean users because the amount of online information in Korean is relatively small. In 2002, Yahoo Korea was dominant with about 80% market share.5Eunhe Jeong, “The collapse of Yahoo in South Korea,” E-Journal, http://www.e-journal.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=783 (accessed April 1, 2014).5However, Yahoo Korea had kept losing its market share ever since Naver’s Knowledge-In became successful. Yahoo Korea finally closed its operation in South Korea as of December 31, 2012. Naver’s market share in South Korea in 2010 was 72%, while Google’s market share at that time was less than 5%.6Michael Bonfils,“Search Marketing Guide to Naver, Korea’s Most Popular Search Engine,” Search Engine Watch, http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2070244/Search-Marketing-Guide-to-Naver-Koreas-Most-Popular-Search-Engine (accessed November 6, 2013).6Given that Google has been dominating many countries in Europe, South America, and Asia, its small market share in South Korea is surprising.7Bas van den Beld,“Google market shares around the globe,” State of Digital, http://www.stateofdigital.com/google-market-shares-around-the-globe/ (accessed November 7, 2013).7Although it has a huge membership, Yahoo! Answers does not appear to have helped Yahoo obtain more user visits. The market share of Yahoo in June 2005 was 30.4%, and decreased to 28.5% one year later.8Comscore, “Google’s U.S. search market share continues to climb in June; Yahoo! also post gains,” http://ir.comscore.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=245876 (accessed November 7, 2013).8Since then, Yahoo has continuously lost market share, dropping to about 11% in July 2013.9Matt Southern, “Google’s search market share back up to 67%; Bing up 2% from last year,” http://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-search-market-share-back-up-to-67-bing-up-2-from-last-year/67568/ (accessed November 7, 2013).9Unlike the closed-answer database of Naver, Yahoo has kept its answer database open (i.e., accessible to other search engines). Therefore, users do not have to use Yahoo to search its answer database. Furthermore, the value of Yahoo’s answer database in attracting users seems to be limited because the amount of online information in English is enormous. It would appear worthwhile questioning whether Yahoo could have gained more market share by making its answer database closed.Unlike Yahoo and Naver, Google currently does not provide a knowledge-sharing service.10Google provides Google groups in which people may discuss issues related to any topics. However, we do not consider Google groups as Google’s knowledge-sharing service. First, Google groups can also be used for private group communications. Second, Google groups’ postings cannot be searched unless they are set available to the public. Finally, Google groups’ advertising revenue is zero while Naver and Yahoo’s knowledge-sharing services generate advertising revenues.10Google did at one stage initiate an answering service, called Google Answers. Its users obtained answers to their questions from recruited answerers for a fee. However, Google shut down the service in December 2006. Google Answers was different from general knowledge-sharing services in that its service users and hired answerers did not impose cross-group network externalities on each other. In contrast, as indicated by Kim and Tse (2011), on knowledge-sharing websites, more questioners attract more answerers, which in turn attract more questioners. Given that most answer databases of successful knowledge-sharing services are open,11There are exceptions, such as Naver and ExpertsExchange (a membership-based IT knowledge-sharing service provider).11Google has not needed to build its own knowledge-sharing service.Given that Google is considered to have a superior search technology, inferior search engines may still increase their search capabilities or introduce their own knowledge-sharing services to better compete with Google. Since Google can enjoy its competitive edge from its huge database of indexed pages, it would be extremely difficult for inferior search engines to surpass Google in terms of search quality (Argenton and Prüfer 2012). However, users may still visit inferior search engines if their initial search on Google is unsatisfactory. To capture this residual demand, inferior search engines may choose to improve their search technologies. However, if the amount of online information is small, they may rather choose to develop a knowledge-sharing service, as Naver did. In this case, they need to decide whether to keep their answer databases closed.By keeping its answer database closed, an inferior search engine can use the database as a proprietary asset to increase its attractiveness to searchers. On the other hand, if the inferior search engine makes its answer database open, it indirectly helps superior search engines access more information. In this case, users may never reach the inferior search engine, because their initial search results on the superior search engine would have included the entries from the inferior search engine’s answer database.To clarify these trade-offs, our study investigates the optimal choice for an inferior search engine between improving its search technology and introducing a knowledge-sharing service with a closed or open answer database. To this end, the proposed game-theoretic model of competition between inferior and superior search engines focuses on the former’s optimal choice, assuming that the latter does not develop its own knowledge-sharing service. The proposed model reflects the current search engine market in which Google is considered to have a superior search technology (without a knowledge-sharing service), while competing search engines, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, either have or had their own knowledge-sharing services.12Microsoft had its own knowledge-sharing service, which it subsequently closed in 2009.12Our study is mainly related to the literature on search engine competition. Telang et al. (2004) show that inferior-quality search engines may coexist with superior search engines because the former can be visited by searchers who fail to find satisfactory results from the latter. The proposed model modifies theirs by incorporating the value to searchers of a knowledge-sharing service into the utility of an inferior search engine. In addition, as adopted by Kim and Tse (2012), the proposed model considers the amount of online information as a factor that influences the utilities of search engines. Kim and Tse (2012) show that the value of a knowledge-sharing service to an inferior search engine decreases as the amount of online information increases by modeling the open-loop differential game between an inferior search engine with a knowledge-sharing service and a superior one without it. Their model assumes myopic behavior by searchers, but our study is built on a fulfilled expectations equilibrium in which searchers’ expectations of the utility of search engines are realized. Kim and Tse (2012) analyze the impact of developing a knowledge-sharing service on the competition between inferior and superior search engines, assuming that their search qualities are fixed. In contrast, the proposed model allows an inferior search engine to choose between improving its search quality and introducing a knowledge-sharing service.The likelihood of Google’s dominance in the worldwide search engine market has been investigated. Pollock (2010) concludes that Google will continue to dominate the search engine market, assuming that searchers use only a single search engine. In contrast to his assumption that searchers visit only one search engine, the proposed model, like that developed by Telang et al. (2004), allows searchers to visit other search engines when their first search results are not satisfactory. Bradlow and Schmittlein (1999) empirically support searchers’ multihoming behavior. In other words, searchers tend to use multiple search engines. Argenton and Prüfer (2012) argue that once a search engine has the largest market share, it will continue to be dominant because it can utilize its private search logs to provide better search results in the future. Their argument supports the proposed model’s assumption that an inferior search engine’s search quality cannot be improved to be better than that of a superior search engine.The relationship between unpaid “organic” search results and paid advertisement links has been studied. Yang and Ghose (2010) show the positive relationship between these unpaid and paid links, so that a merchant has an incentive to pay for being listed as an advertiser on a search engine. Taylor (2013) verifies that competing search engines may provide low-quality organic search results so that searchers click on paid advertisement links, which generate advertising revenue for the search engines. White (2013) validates that an increase in the quality of organic search results may either increase or decrease the prices posted by advertisers. We abstract from these interactions between organic and paid links, assuming that better quality search results mean increased advertising revenue for the search engine.Our study is also related to the literature on two-sided markets. For representative models in two-sided-market research, refer to Rochet and Tirole (2003), Rochet and Tirole (2006), and Armstrong (2006), among many others. Kim and Tse (2012) consider search engines as platforms that connect searchers and information providers on the Internet. From this perspective, multiple search engines tend to coexist, because both searchers and online information providers (or online information itself) tend to multihome. Under the proposed model, an inferior search engine can decrease the degree of information multihoming by closing its answer database. Our study shows that doing so helps the inferior search engine obtain more market share than it would with an open answer database, but only when its search quality is not far behind that of a competing superior search engine.While we consider the competition between inferior and superior search engines, we focus on the inferior search engine’s optimal decision between introducing a knowledge-sharing service and improving its search technology. Fig. 1describes the extensive-form game representation of the proposed model. In stage 1, the inferior search engine (henceforth, SE1) first decides between introducing a knowledge-sharing service and improving its search technology. If SE1 decides to improve its search technology, it then determines the optimal search quality that will maximize its profit. If SE1 decides to develop its own knowledge-sharing service, then in stage 2, it decides whether to open or close its answer database. Here, an open database means that it is accessible to the superior search engine (henceforth, SE2). We solve for the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the proposed model.If SE1 chooses to introduce a knowledge-sharing service, visitors may benefit from both this service and its search service. In terms of the knowledge-sharing service, visitors may find answers to their questions in the answer database, or they may post questions to obtain relevant answers from other members of the service. As indicated by Kim and Tse (2011), the success of the knowledge-sharing service will attract more users, which in turn increase the service’s utility. To deal with this chicken-and-egg relationship, we employ the equilibrium concept of fulfilled expectations in which searchers’ expectations about the integrated value of SE1’s search and knowledge-sharing services are realized.The timing of the subgame in which SE1 introduces a knowledge-sharing service is as follows. First, SE1 decides whether to close its answer database. Second, searchers form expectations about the number of answerers (A) of SE1’s knowledge-sharing service and the size of its answer database (K).13As explained later in this section, searchers essentially form expectations about their demand for SE1.13Searchers then compare the expected utilities that SE1 and SE2 provide. If SE1 provides a higher expected utility than SE2, searchers will first visit SE1. If not, they will first visit SE2. Lastly, searchers may visit the competing search engine if they fail to find answers to their questions using the first search engine.As adopted by Kim and Tse (2012), search engine i’s search quality is denoted bysi∈0,1fori=1,2. The search quality parameter s refers to the search engine’s capability to acquire and retrieve relevant information. Since SE1 refers to an inferior search engine,s1<s2.Without a knowledge-sharing service, as Kim and Tse (2012) suggest, the demand for each search engine is given as follows:D1=s1I(1-s2I);D2=s2I,whereI∈[0,1]represents the amount of information available on the Internet in a particular language. Briefly, if the utility provided to searchers by SEi is assumed to be represented by the indicator function of1{ifthesearchresultissatisfactory}, andsiIrefers to the probability that the search result will be satisfactory, the expected utility provided by SEi is given bysiI. Then, the above demands can be derived by assuming that searchers’ cost of visiting a search engine is uniformly distributed along the unit interval of[0,1].D1is modified by the factor of(1-s2I), which is the probability that SE2 will not satisfy searchers. That is, searchers first visit SE2, and may visit SE1 if their first search result is not satisfactory.When SE1 introduces a knowledge-sharing service, searchers visiting SE1 first search its answer database and online content. In case their search results are not satisfactory, they may obtain answers to their questions by posting them online. While Kim and Tse (2012) separately model the expected utilities provided by SE1 and its knowledge-sharing service, we incorporate the expected value of its knowledge-sharing service to searchers into SE1’s expected utility as follows. GivenKeandAe,(1)E[U1]=Ke+s1I︸amountofinformationsearchable+d(1-Ke-s1I)×Ae︸prob.thatanswererswillanswer,whereKe∈[0,1]is the searcher’s expectation about the normalized amount of information stored in the answer database;14For simplicity, we assume the information contained in the database does not overlap with other online content.14Ae∈[0,1]is the searcher’s expectation about the normalized number of answerers joining SE1; andd∈0,1is the patience parameter for searchers. The patience parameter indicates the degree to which searchers are willing to post a question and wait for replies from answerers. As d approaches one, most searchers will post questions and wait for replies if they cannot find answers from the search results. We use the amount of SE1’s searchable information,Ke+s1I, as the probability that searchers will find the answers they seek by searching existing content that SE1 can index. We also employ the normalized number of answers,Ae, as the probability thatAeanswerers will provide answers to posted questions.SE2’s expected utility to searchers increases if SE1 makes its answer database accessible to SE2:E[U2]=s2(I+zKe),wherez∈{0,1}is an indicator function, which takes the value one if the database is open and zero if closed.Given the expected utilities of both search engines, searchers first visit the search engine with the higher expected utility, and may visit the search engine with lower expected utility if the former fails to provide the answers they seek. Thus, the demands for SE1 and SE2 are determined as follows:IfE[U1]>E[U2],15Note that we assume searchers of SE1 can still visit SE2 while they are waiting for answers to their questions.15(2)D1=E[U1],D2=E[U2](1-Ke-s1I);IfE[U1]<E[U2],(3)D1=E[U1](1-s2(I+zKe))+E[U2]s2(I+zKe)zKeI+zKe︸SE2-visitingsearchersindirectlyledtoSE1′sanswerdatabase=E[U1](1-s2(I+zKe))+E[U2]zs2Ke=E[U1](1-s2I)+zs2Ke(E[U2]-E[U1]︸>0),D2=E[U2].The first line of Eq. (3) consists of two parts. The first part refers to the demand of searchers who use SE1 as their second trial after their first search on SE2 is not satisfactory. The second part refers to the demand of searchers whose first (successful) search on SE2 leads them to SE1’s answer database. Note that searchers using SE1’s knowledge-sharing service are modeled to constitute a proportion of the demand for SE1. In Eq. (3),D2includes both the successful and failed searches by searchers whose search cost does not exceedE[U2].When SE1 is expected to provide the higher utility, it has no reason to open its answer database, because the open answer database only helps SE2 access more information. However, when SE1 is expected to provide the lower utility, it can increase its demand,D1, by having some SE2 searchers indirectly visit SE1 when their search results show links to data from SE1’s answer database. In return, SE1 helps SE2 index more information.SE1, along with its own knowledge-sharing service, can attract more answerers and obtain more answers if it can attract more searchers, and vice versa (Kim and Tse 2011). Nam et al. (2009) and Constant et al. (1996) empirically confirm that experts in a society or organization are willing to help others (with whom they have little acquaintance) obtain relevant information. Thus, if knowledge-sharing services have more searchers (so more questioners), more answerers are expected to join the services. We assume the number of answerers joining SE1 is proportional to the number of searchers using SE1:(4)Ae=αD1e,whereα∈0,1is the degree of the cross-group network effect of searchers on answerers16The number of answerers is generally smaller than the number of searchers because there is a limited number of experts who can spend their valuable time on a knowledge-sharing website.16andD1eis the searcher’s expectation aboutD1. The amount of information contained in SE1’s answer database is also assumed to be proportional to the number of its searchers:(5)Ke=γD1e,whereγ∈0,1is the normalized number of answered questions per searcher using SE1.17The linear relationships (4) and (5) can be derived by assumingAeis linear inD1eandKe, andKeis linear inD1eandAe.17The searcher’ expectations about A and K then come fromD1e. These assumptions enable us to measureE[U1]andE[U2]in terms ofD1e, and thus we can findD1∗that satisfiesD1∗=D1ein Eqs. (2) and (3).Before we proceed to an analysis of the model, we make the following two assumptions to ensure that neither SE1 nor SE2 have a probability of 1 of answering searchers’ questions.Assumption 3.1We assumeγ+s1I<1to ensure that SE1, with a knowledge-sharing service, will not answer searchers’ questions with a probability of 1. That is, this assumption ensures thatK+s1I=γD1+s1I<1, for allD1∈[0,1].We assumes2(γ+I)<1to ensure that SE2 will not answer searchers’ questions with a probability of 1 when SE2 can access SE1’s answer database. That is, this assumption ensures thats2(K+I)=s2(γD1+I)<1, for allD1∈[0,1].We find two kinds of fulfilled-expectation equilibria for the subgame with SE1’s knowledge-sharing service. In the first, searchers’ expectations ofU1>U2are fulfilled, and in the second, their expectations ofU2>U1are fulfilled. We investigate the conditions under which these expectations can be fulfilled and how these conditions change if SE1 opens its answer database.Searchers can expect SE1 to provide a higher utility than SE2 when SE1 has a well-established knowledge-sharing community. For instance, Naver had been operating a successful knowledge-sharing service when Google entered the Korean search engine market in 2006, and Naver has been successful in keeping Google from capturing a significant market share. Google’s market share was 1.7% as of July 2007.18Choe, Sang-hun “South Koreans Connect through Search Engine.” The New York Times, July 5, 2007.18For SE1’s knowledge-sharing service to be successful, either the search quality of SE2 or the amount of information on the Internet should be limited. Without one of these limitations, searchers visiting SE2 are likely to be satisfied with the search results, and will not visit SE1. In addition, for answerers to be valuable to searchers, searchers need to be prepared to wait patiently for replies to their questions. Proposition 1 confirms this reasoning.Proposition 1When SE1’s answer database is closed, the fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in which SE1 is expected to provide a higher utility than SE2 is sustained when the following conditions hold:d∈(0,1],I∈(0,1]ifs1⩾(1-γ)s2;d>g1c(I),I∈(0,1]if(1-γ-α+αγs2)s21-αs2<s1<(1-γ)s2;d>g1c(I),I∈(0,i1c)if(1-γ-α)s2<s1⩽(1-γ-α+αγs2)s21-αs2;Noequilibriumifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s2,wherei1c=s1-(1-γ-α)s2αs2(s1+γs2)andg1c(I)=(1-γ)s2-s1αs2{1-(s1+γs2)I}. When the equilibrium is sustained, equilibrium demands are specified by Eqs. (A.2) and (A.3)in the proof.Proposition 1 suggests that with an increase in the degrees of the cross network effects (i.e., α and γ) on its knowledge-sharing service, SE1 is more likely to provide a higher utility than SE2. Note that when(1-γ)s2>s1,g1c(I)is convex19We can verify thatg1cI″>0when(1-γ)s2>s1:g1cI″=2((1-γ)s2-s1)(s1+γs2)2s2α(1-(s1+γs2)I)3.19and increasing inI, which implies that for SE1 to provide higher utility in equilibrium, much more patience is needed as online content increases.Suppose that SE1 opens its answer database to SE2’s search queries. When searchers expectE[U1]>E[U2]in equilibrium,E[U1]does not change, butE[U2]increases bys2K. Thus, as Eq. (2) indicates,D1will beE[U1], as it is when the database is closed, butD2will increase becauseE[U2]increases. An increase inE[U2]also implies the equilibrium conditions will be tighter than when the answer database is closed.Proposition 2When SE1’s answer database is open, the fulfilled-expectation-equilibrium in which SE1 is expected to provide higher utility than SE2 is sustained when the following conditions hold:d∈(0,1],I∈(0,1]ifs1⩾(1-γ)s21-γs2;d>g1o(I),I∈(0,1]if(1-γ-α)s2+αγs221-γs21-(α+γ)s2<s1<(1-γ)s21-γs2d>g1o(I),I∈(0,i1o)if(1-γ-α)s21-γs2<s1<(1-γ-α)s2+αγs221-γs21-(α+γ)s2;Noequilibriumifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s21-γs2,whereg1o(I)=(1-γ)s2-s1(1-γs2)αs21-s1+γs21-γs2Iandi1o=s1(1-γs2)-(1-α-γ)s2αs2s1+γs21-γs2. When the equilibrium is sustained, the equilibrium demands are specified by Eqs. (A.2) and (A.6).Note thats2I1-γs2<1, from Assumption 3.2, implying that the denominator ofg1o(I)is always positive. A comparison of Propositions 1 and 2 implies that for searchers to first visit SE1 in equilibrium, SE1 should have a higher search quality when its answer database is open than it does when its answer database is closed. We can also verify thatg1o(I)>g1c(I), for allI∈(0,1], which suggests the region in which the equilibrium is sustainable should become smaller as SE1 opens its answer database.From Propositions 1 and 2, the following theorem describes the impact of SE1 opening its answer database on the equilibrium in which searchers first visit SE1 because of its knowledge-sharing service (e.g.,E[U1]>E[U2]):Theorem 3.1For the fulfilled-expectations equilibrium, in whichE[U1]>E[U2], to be satisfied, the region in which the equilibrium holds shrinks when SE1 opens its answer database; no change inD1∗will occur. Therefore, SE1 is advised to keep its answer database closed if searchers are expected to first visit SE1 because of its knowledge-sharing service.Fig. 2shows typical regions of the equilibria specified by Propositions 1 and 2. When SE1’s search technology is inferior to that of SE2 (e.g.,s1=0.4), online content should be limited and searchers need to be patient for the equilibrium in whichE[U1]>E[U2]to be fulfilled. When SE1 opens its answer database, the equilibrium region gets smaller towards the left-top corner. For instance, ifs1=0.4, the equilibrium in which SE1 is the first choice of searchers holds only when SE1 keeps its answer database closed.Searchers can expect SE2 to provide a higher utility when SE1’s knowledge-sharing service is not valuable to the searchers. The value of SE1’s knowledge-sharing service to searchers is likely to be limited when they can generally find online information relevant to their questions and have little patience to wait for replies from answerers. The following Propositions 3 and 4 show these arguments are valid.Proposition 3When SE1’s answer database is closed, the fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in which SE2 is expected to provide a higher utility than SE1 is sustained when the following conditions hold:Noequilibriumifs1⩾(1-γ)s2+γs22;d<g2c(I),I∈(i2c,1]if(1-γ)s2⩽s1<s2(1-γ)+γs22;d<g2c(I),I∈(0,1]if(1-γ-α)s2<s1<(1-γ)s2;d∈(0,1],I∈(0,1]ifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s2,wherei2c=s1-s2(1-γ)γs22andg2c(I)=(1-γ)s2-s1+γs22Iαs2(1-s2I){1-(s1+γs2(1-s2I))I}. When the equilibrium is sustained,D1∗is specified by Eq. (A.8), andD2∗=s2I.Note thatg2c(I)is greater thang1c(I), for allI∈0,1, implying that when the difference in search quality between SE1 and SE2 is neither small nor large, the two types of fulfilled-expectation equilibria can hold at the same time. We can also verify thatg2c(I)increases inIand is convex inIby checking its first-order derivative, which increases inI. This result implies that asIincreases, the equilibrium in which searchers expect SE2 to provide a higher utility than SE1 can hold, provided searchers are much more patient.Combining Propositions 1 and 3, the following theorem shows the conditions under which the types of fulfilled-expectation equilibria can be sustained when SE1 closes its answer database:Theorem 3.2Suppose that SE1 keeps its answer database closed. Let us label a fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in which SE1 provides a higher utility,FEE1C, and one in which SE2 provides a higher utility,FEE2C. The following fulfilled-expectation equilibria hold:ifs1⩾(1-γ)s2+γs22I:onlyFEE1Choldsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1];if(1-γ)s2⩽s1<(1-γ)s2+γs22:FEE1Choldsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1],andFEE2Choldswhend<g2c(I)andI∈(i2c,1];if(1-γ-α+αγs2)s21-αs2<s1<(1-γ)s2:FEE1Choldswhend>g1c(I)andI∈(0,1],andFEE2Choldswhend<g2c(I)andI∈(0,1];if(1-γ-α)s2<s1⩽(1-γ-α+αγs2)s21-αs2:FEE1Choldswhend>g1c(I)andI∈(0,i1c),andFEE2Choldswhend<g2c(I)andI∈(0,1];ifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s2:onlyFEE2Choldsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1],wherei2c=s1-s2(1-γ)γs22andi1c=s1-(1-γ-α)s2αs2(s1+γs2).Sinceg1c(I)<g2c(I), there exists a(I,d)-region in which bothFEE1CandFEE2Ccan be sustained, which occurs when the search quality of SE1 is neither relatively low nor high. This coexistence of the two types of equilibria can occur when we apply the concept of a fulfilled-expectation equilibrium to a game-theoretic model with network externalities (Katz and Shapiro 1985).Comparing Propositions 3 and 4 tells us that the SE2-winning equilibrium will hold for a larger region when SE1’s answer database is open than when it is closed.Proposition 4When SE1’s database is open, the fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in which SE2 is expected to provide a higher utility than SE1 is sustained when the following conditions hold:Noequilibriumifs1⩾(1-γ)s2+γs221-γs2+γs22;d<g2o(I),I∈(i2o,1]if(1-γ)s21-γs2<s1<(1-γ)s2+γs221-γs2+γs22;d<g2o(I),I∈(0,1]if(1-γ-α)s21-γs2<s1⩽(1-γ)s21-γs2;d∈(0,1],I∈(0,1]ifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s21-γs2,whereg2o(I)=(1-γs2+γs22I){(1-γ(1-s1))s2-s1+γ(1-s1)s22I}αs2(1-s2I){1-γs2-(s1+γs2(1-s2I)-γs2(s1+s2)+γs1s22I)I}andi2o=(1-γ(1-s1))s2-s1γ(1-s1)s22. When the equilibrium is sustained,D1∗is given by Eq.(A.10)andD2∗=s2(γD1∗+I).Note that we can verify thatg2o(I)>g2c(I), for allI∈0,1, which implies that when SE1 opens its answer database, the fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in whichE[U1]<E[U2]is satisfied can be sustained for a larger(I,d)-region. Fig. 3also confirms that the equilibrium regions in which searchers’ expectations ofU2>U1are fulfilled grow as SE1 opens its answer database. This result suggests that SE1 can increase the number of searchers using its service by opening its answer database, but then it risks losing its leading position.Combining Propositions 2 and 4, the following theorem describes the equilibrium conditions when SE1 opens its answer database:Theorem 3.3Suppose that SE1 opens its answer database. Let us label a fulfilled-expectation equilibrium in which SE1 provides a higher utility,FEE1O, and one in which SE2 provides a higher utility,FEE2O. The following fulfilled-expectation equilibria hold:ifs1⩾(1-γ)s2+γs221-γs2+γs22:onlyFEE1Oholdsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1];if(1-γ)s21-γs2⩽s1<(1-γ)s2+γs221-γs2+γs22:FEE1Oholdsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1],andFEE2Oholdswhend<g2o(I)andI∈(i2o,1];if(1-γ-α)s2+αγs221-γs21-(α+γ)s2<s1<(1-γ)s21-γs2:FEE1Oholdswhend>g1o(I)andI∈(0,1],andFEE2Oholdswhend<g2o(I)andI∈(0,1];if(1-γ-α)s21-γs2<s1⩽(1-γ-α)s2+αγs221-γs21-(α+γ)s2:FEE1Oholdswhend>g1o(I)andI∈(0,i1o),andFEE2Oholdswhend<g2o(I)andI∈(0,1];ifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s21-γs2:onlyFEE2Oholdsforalld∈(0,1]andI∈(0,1],wherei2o=(1-γ(1-s1))s2-s1γ(1-s1)s22andi1o=s1(1-γs2)-(1-α-γ)s2αs2s1+γs21-γs2.Comparing Theorems 3.2 and 3.3, we can see that the SE2-winning equilibrium is more likely to be sustainable if SE1 opens its answer database. Fig. 4shows the typical regions in which the fulfilled-expectation equilibria are sustainable whens1=0.45ands2=0.7. Around the top-left corner, only the equilibrium in whichE[U1]>E[U2]is fulfilled holds; in the other regions, the equilibrium in whichE[U1]<E[U2]is fulfilled can be sustained. As SE1 opens its answer database to SE2, the size of the region in which theE[U1]>E[U2]-fulfilled equilibrium holds significantly decreases. Fig. 5shows the typical regions in whichFEE1jandFEE2j, forj∈{C,O}, hold ass1increases. Ass1increases, the region in which both types of equilibria are sustainable increases. Here, the degree to which a knowledge-sharing service improves SE1’s overall utility to searchers increases ass1approachess2.Before we move on to the case in which SE1 chooses to improve its search technology, we analyze SE1’s decision on whether to open its answer database to maximize its market share. SE1’s optimal choice on the openness of its answer database is especially intriguing when SE1 is the second choice of searchers, because then both search engines’ demands increase when SE1 opens its answer database. Fig. 6illustrates how the demands for SE1 and SE2 change as SE1 opens its answer database.The answer to the question of whether SE1 can increase its market share20Market share of SEi is given byDiD1+D2.20by opening its answer database is provided by Fig. 7. In terms of SE1’s search quality,s1, and the amount of information,I, SE1 is advised to open its answer database only whens1is below some threshold value, which increases inI. Specifically, in region OBCE, SE1 has more market share if it keeps its answer database closed; in region OEF, on the other hand, SE1 obtains more market share by opening its answer database. Region ABCD specifies the equilibrium region in which SE1 is the first choice of searchers when SE1 closes its answer database. In this case, SE1 does not need to open its answer database to increase its market share. In region OADF, in which only the equilibrium in which SE2 is the first choice of searchers holds, SE1 should open its answer database to increase its market share only when SE1’s search quality is below a certain threshold, as indicated by the curve OE.21Because the searchers’ demand for SE1 when the database is open is given implicitly by Eq. (A.10), we numerically solve for curve OE, under which SE1 is advised to open its answer database.21Although Fig. 7 assumes specific parameter values fors2,α, and γ, the general shape of the equilibrium regions will be maintained as these three parameter values change.Fig. 7 implies that when SE1 can index a much smaller amount of information than can SE2 (i.e., when SE1 is a relatively weak competitor to SE2), SE1 can increase its market share further by opening its answer database. Practically, this result suggests that if Yahoo’s search technology is considered comparable or only slightly inferior to that of Google, Yahoo is advised to close its answer database to increase its market share. In the Korean search engine market, with limited online content, Naver’s policy of keeping its answer database closed seems strategically correct. Given the general shape of the equilibrium regions in Fig. 7, we can now ask how much more market share SE1 can gain by introducing a knowledge-sharing service.To answer this question, we first compare the market shares of SE1 with and without a knowledge-sharing service. The third table22The third table is derived by subtracting the first table from the second table.22in Fig. 8 shows how much more market share SE1 can obtain after introducing a knowledge-sharing service. Three different regions exist in the third table. For the top region, the equilibrium in which SE1 with a closed answer database is the first choice of searchers holds. For the middle and bottom regions, only the equilibrium in which SE2 is the first choice of searchers holds. For the middle region, SE1 can gain more market share by closing its answer database. For the bottom region, SE1 should open its answer database to gain more market share. With a knowledge-sharing service, SE1’s market share increases most in the top region, because the search quality difference is relatively small. Note that in this top region, given SE1’s search quality, the increase in its market share grows as the amount of information on the Internet increases. On the other hand, in the middle and bottom regions, in which SE1 is the second choice of searchers, given SE1’s search quality, the increase in its market share diminishes as the amount of information on the Internet increases. This is because, as the amount of information increases, the search engine first visited by searchers is more likely to provide information relevant to their search queries, leaving fewer searchers visiting the other, competing search engine.The last table in Fig. 8shows how much more market share SE1 can obtain or lose by closing a previously open answer database when SE1 is the second choice of searchers in equilibrium (e.g.,E[U1]<E[U2]is fulfilled). In the middle region of the table, the effect on SE1’s market share when it closes its answer database is relatively large when its search quality is not far behind that of SE2 and online content is limited. In the bottom region of the table, the effect is relatively large when SE1’s search quality is low and the amount of information on the Internet is large. The absolute magnitude of the effect is small overall when the amount of information on the Internet is large. In this case, SE1’s answer database becomes less valuable to searchers as the amount of information on the Internet increases.Suppose that SE1 decides to increase its search quality in Stage 1, instead of introducing a knowledge-sharing service. For this subsection only, suppose that the initial search quality of SE1 iss0, instead ofs1, for notational convenience. As specified in Telang et al. (2004), if the search quality of SE1 increases tos1, SE1’s profit is assumed to beΠ1(s1)=rD1(s1)-C(s12-s02),where r is the advertising revenue per searcher visiting SE1;D1is the searchers’ demand for SE1; and C is the cost of increasing the search quality by one unit. That is, SE1’s advertising revenue is linear to its demand, and its cost of achieving a certain search quality is quadratic in the search quality. By dividing the profit function by r, we normalize SE1’s profit as follows:π1(s1)=D1(s1)-c(s12-s02)=s1I(1-s2I)-c(s12-s02)(aslongass1⩽s2),where c is the normalized cost of increasing the search quality by one unit. We assume that whens1becomes the same ass2, searchers still visit SE2 first because of their inertia of visiting a previously better search engine.SE1’s optimal search quality can be derived by solving the following optimization problem23The constraint ofs1⩽s2is partly supported by Argenton and Prüfer (2012). They show that a leading search engine will continue to outperform other following search engines, because the leading search engine will continue to have the largest set of indexed pages.23:(6)maxs1s1I(1-s2I)-c(s12-s02)subjecttos0⩽s1⩽s2.By solving the above constrained optimization problem, we obtain Proposition 5,24The proof of Proposition 5 is omitted. By considering the position ofs1mrelative tos0ands2, we can derive the results specified in Proposition 5.24which describes the optimal search quality of SE1.Proposition 5If SE1 chooses the option of increasing its search quality, the optimal search quality of SE1 (with corresponding profits) is determined as follows:s1∗=s0[withπ1(s0)=s0I(1-s2I)]ifc⩾I(1-s2I)2s0s1m=I(1-s2I)2c[withπ1(s1m)={I(1-s2I)}24c+cs02]ifI(1-s2I)2s2<c<I(1-s2I)2s0s2[withπ1(s2)=s2I(1-s2I)-c(s22-s02)]ifc⩽I(1-s2I)2s2,wheres1mis the maximizer of the objective function in(6)alone (without any constraint).Proposition 5 agrees with the intuition that as the cost of improving the search quality decreases, SE1 is advised to choose a higher search quality. In other words, as the improvement in search quality further increases advertising revenue (i.e., asI(1-s2I)increases), SE1 has more incentive to increase its search quality. Because the expressionI(1-s2I)is not always increasing inI∈0,1whens2>12, we have the following Lemma 125The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted. The key point in deriving the result of Lemma 1 is to observe that the expressionI(1-s2I)becomes1-s2whenI=1. Whenc⩽1-s22s2holds,s1∗is non-decreasing inI.25about the monotonicity of SE1’s optimal search quality as the amount of information increases.Lemma 1When the search quality of SE2 is low (i.e.,s2⩽12), the optimal search quality of SE1 is non-decreasing in the amount of indexable information on the Internet. When the search quality of SE2 is high (i.e.,s2>12), the optimal search quality of SE1 may decrease in the amount of indexable information if the amount of information exceeds a certain threshold (i.e.,I>12s2) and the cost of increasing its search quality is high (i.e.,c>1-s22s2).Lemma 1 can be understood as follows. When the search quality of SE2 is high and the amount of information is large, the potential residual demand for SE1 (i.e.,1-s2I) becomes too small to provide enough of an incentive to invest in increasing its search quality to the level justified by a smaller amount of information. Lemma 1 is well illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows the optimal search quality of SE1 given SE1’s initial search quality (s0) and the amount of online information (I). Whens2=0.7andc=0.3, ifs0=0.55, as the amount of online information increases, the optimal search quality of SE1 first increases froms0tos1m, but decreases tos0as the amount of online information becomes close to 1. However, whens2=0.4(regardless of how large c is), for any givens0, the optimal search quality of SE1 does not decrease as the amount of online information increases.To find when SE1 is advised to introduce a knowledge-sharing service rather than increase its search quality, we need to compare the profits of these two options. The optimal search quality and the corresponding profit are provided by Proposition 5. When SE1 introduces a knowledge-sharing service, as shown in subSections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, we derive all the fulfilled expectations equilibria depending on whether SE1 closes or opens its answer database. For each of these equilibria, we can calculate the demand for SE1 with a knowledge-sharing service. By assuming that SE1’s cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is fixed, SE1’s profit when including a knowledge-sharing service is as follows:(7)π1k=D1k-Ck,whereD1kis the demand for SE1 when SE1 introduces a knowledge-sharing service, andCkis the (normalized) fixed cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service.Given that SE1’s cost of developing a knowledge-sharing service is fixed, SE1 has to maximize its demand to maximize its profit. The demand for SE1 will be maximized if SE1 is the first choice of searchers in equilibrium. If SE1 is the second choice of searchers, as Eq. (3) indicates, SE1 can increase its demand by opening its answer database. As Fig. 4 indicates, SE1 is more likely to be the first choice of searchers when SE1 keeps its answer database closed. Thus, SE1’s (maximum) profit can be derived from the following two equilibria: (1) SE1 closes its answer database and is the first choice of searchers; and (2) SE1 keeps its answer database open and is the second choice of searchers.By comparing the profit of SE1 with a knowledge-sharing service with its profit when it chooses an optimal search quality, as specified by Proposition 5, we derive the following sufficient conditions under which SE1 will earn more profit by introducing a closed knowledge-sharing service than if it increases its search quality.Theorem 3.4To maximize its profit, SE1 is advised to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service if this means it will be the first choice of searchers in equilibrium, and exactly one of the following three conditions holds:(8)Ck⩽s2I-s0I(1-s2I)andI(1-s2I)⩽2s0c;(9)Ck⩽c({s1m}2-s02)and2s0c<I(1-s2I)<2s2c;(10)Ck⩽c(s22-s02)andI(1-s2I)⩾2s2c,wheres1m=I(1-s2I)2c,Ckis the cost of developing a knowledge-sharing service and c is the cost of increasing the search quality from zero to one.The proof of Theorem 3.4 is provided in the Appendix A. The results can be derived by combining the results of Propositions 1, 4, and 5.We may interpret the results of Theorem 3.4 depending on the amount of information on the Internet. For a clear interpretation, let us suppose that the optimal search quality of SE1 is non-decreasing along with the amount of information. When the amount of information is small, the second part of Eq. (8) is likely to hold. The first part of the equation implies that when the cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is less than (or equal to) the profit gap between SE1 and SE2 in the base model (i.e., without any knowledge-sharing service), SE1 will choose to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service to maximize profit. Note that the profit gap between SE1 without a knowledge-sharing service and SE2 is small when the amount of information on the Internet is small. Thus, even with smallCk, ifIis small, SE1’s introduction of a knowledge-sharing service may not be preferred.When information on the Internet is abundant, the second part of condition (10) will hold. In this case, the first part of the equation implies that as long as the cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is small (i.e., less than the cost incurred when SE1 matches its search quality to that of SE2), it is better for SE1 to choose the option of a closed knowledge-sharing service if it will be the first choice of searchers in equilibrium. When the amount of information is neither small nor large, if the cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is less than the cost incurred when SE1 increases its search quality to the optimal level, SE1 is advised to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service. Therefore, as long as the amount of information is not small, if the cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is small compared to the cost of improving its search quality to optimal levels, SE1 can achieve maximum profit by developing a knowledge-sharing service. As shown in Fig. 10, which provides SE1’s profit-maximizing strategy, unless the amount of information is small, as long as SE1 becomes the first choice of searchers after introducing a closed knowledge-sharing service, SE1’s profit with the closed knowledge-sharing service is greater than it will be with an optimally increased search quality. Thus, when SE1’s original search quality,s0, is somewhat close to SE2 (i.e., SE1 is not a weak competitor to SE2), SE1 is advised to introduce a knowledge-sharing service and keep the answer database closed to achieve maximum profits. Yahoo could have increased its profit by closing its answer database in the US if its search technology is not far behind that of Google.According to Fig. 10, when the amount of information is very small and the cost of introducing a knowledge-sharing service is not negligible, SE1 should neither increase its search quality nor introduce a knowledge-sharing service for more profit. Here, the additional demand from either of these options is not large enough to cover the corresponding development cost. If the amount of information is very small, we have the following approximate condition under which SE1 should introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service by substituting 0 forIin Eq. (A.12) in the Appendix A:(11)γ⩾1-αd1-αdCk⇔Ck⩽γ+αd-1γαdEq. (11) implies that when the amount of information is very small, for SE1 to choose a closed knowledge-sharing service, searchers and (potential) answerers must be strongly willing to join the knowledge-sharing service (i.e.,αd+γ>1). Otherwise, SE1 will be better off keeping its current search quality and not introducing a knowledge-sharing service. Naver’s knowledge-sharing service with its closed answer database became rapidly successful after its launch in 2002. This fast growth of its knowledge-sharing service enabled Naver to win over once dominant Yahoo Korea.Fig. 10 also shows that SE2’s search quality influences SE1’s profit-maximizing strategy. Given the sameCkand c, the region in which SE1 should introduce a knowledge-sharing service expands as the search quality of the competing SE2 increases from 0.4 to 0.7. In addition, when SE2 is a relatively strong competitor, the profit-maximizing strategy of SE1 can change several times as the amount of online information increases. For instance, according to the right-bottom graph of Fig. 10 (i.e.,s2=0.7;Ck=0.01;c=0.25), if the initial search quality of SE1 is around 0.3, the profit-maximizing strategy of SE1 changes as the amount of online information increases as follows: do nothing⇒introduce an open knowledge-sharing service⇒increase the search quality tos1m⇒increase the search quality tos2⇒decrease the search quality tos1m.This study considers the competition between inferior and superior search engines, focusing on the impact of a knowledge-sharing service on the competitiveness of an inferior search engine. Our research aims to determine the profit-maximizing strategy for an inferior search engine when it can introduce a knowledge-sharing service (to compensate for its lower search quality) or increase its search quality. Our study also shows the inferior search engine’s optimal strategy on whether to open or close an answer database when introducing a knowledge-sharing service.The subgame in which the inferior search engine introduces a knowledge-sharing service can have two different types of fulfilled expectations equilibrium. The first equilibrium, in which the inferior search engine with a knowledge-sharing service outperforms the superior search engine, requires a high degree of searcher patience and a small amount of online information. In addition, the difference in search quality between the two search engines should not be large. To a degree, this analytical result agrees with Naver’s huge success in South Korea, which it owes to its well-established knowledge-sharing service. The amount of online content in Korean is generally much more limited than that in English.The second equilibrium, in which the inferior search engine is the second choice of searchers, requires a relatively low degree of searcher patience and a large amount of online information. In addition, the inferior search engine’s search technology should be noticeably worse than that of the superior search engine. To a certain extent, this analytical result explains why Yahoo has not gained more market share in the US after introducing its successful knowledge-sharing service.For the subgame, the answer to the question of whether the inferior search engine should open its answer database to increase its market share depends on the search quality difference and the amount of information available on the Internet. When the search quality difference is large, the inferior search engine should open its answer database to obtain more market share. When the search quality difference is limited by a certain threshold, which decreases with an increase in the amount of information available on the Internet, the inferior search engine should keep its answer database closed.The profit-maximizing strategy of the inferior search engine depends on the amount of online information, the search quality difference, the cost of providing a knowledge-sharing service, and the cost of improving search quality. When the amount of online information is limited, unless the cost of developing a knowledge-sharing service is very low, the inferior search engine should do nothing to maximize its profit. When the amount of online information is not limited, if the search quality difference is large, the inferior search engine should increase its search quality. If the search quality difference is small, the inferior search engine should introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service. If the search quality difference is neither small nor large, the inferior search engine should introduce an open knowledge-sharing service or increase its search quality, depending on the cost of doing so. To summarize, if the search quality difference is small, the inferior search engine should introduce a knowledge-sharing service, and keep its answer database closed to gain more market share and profit. However, if the search quality difference is large, the inferior search engine should increase its search quality to maximize its profit, even when the cost of developing a knowledge-sharing service is negligible.The empirical verification of our analytical results can be a promising research topic. Searchers’ patience parameter, the amount of information available on the Internet, and search quality difference can be estimated for the US and Korean search engine markets. Several players in these markets can then be positioned according to these estimated values. Besides, our study can be extended to other countries such as China, Japan, and Russia, in which Google is not the leading search engine. Cultural differences as well as the use of knowledge-sharing services can be examined to understand why local search engines maintain leading positions in these countries.Proof of Proposition 1For notational simplicity, we omit superscript e throughout the rest of the paper. Searchers’ demand for SE1 can be found using Eqs. (2), (4), and (5):(A.1)D1=E[U1]=K+s1I+d(1-K-s1I)A=γD1+s1I+d(1-K-s1I)αD1→(1-γ)D1-s1I=dαD1(1-s1I-γD1)We can easily check thatD1, satisfying Eq. (A.1), is not greater than 1: from Fig. 11, withD1=1,(1-γ)-s1I⩾dα(1-s1I-γ)(∵γ+s1I<1byAssumption3.1and0<dα⩽1).If we solve Eq. (A.1),(A.2)D1∗=-(1-γ-dα(1-s1I))+(1-γ-dα(1-s1I))2+4γαds1I2γdα.From Eqs. (2) and (5),(A.3)D2∗=s2I(1-γD1-s1I)=s2I(1-γ+dα(1-s1I))-(1-γ-dα(1-s1I))2+4γαds1I2dα.Finally, we need to find the conditions under whichD1∗andD2∗satisfyE[U1]>E[U2]:(A.4)E[U1]>E[U2]⇔D1∗>s2I⇔(1-γ)s2I-s1I<dαs2I(1-s1I-γs2I)(withD1=s2IinFig. 11)∴d>(1-γ)s2-s1αs2{1-(s1+γs2)I}≔g1c(I).Sinceg1c(I)is increasing inI, ifs1⩽(1-γ-α)s2, the equilibrium cannot be sustained for any d andI:g1c(0)=(1-γ)s2-s1αs2⩾1⇔(1-γ-α)s2⩾s1.On the other hand, ifs1⩾(1-γ)s2, the equilibrium always holds:g1c(I)⩽0forallI∈(0,1]⇔(1-γ)s2⩽s1.(∵Assumption 3.2)Additionally, wheng1c(1)<1, the equilibrium can hold ford>g1c(I)and allI∈0,1;g1c(1)<1⇔(1-γ)s2-s1<αs2(1-s1-γs2)⇔(1-αs2)s1>(1-γ-α+αγs2)s2.Finally,i1cis the solution tog1c(x)=1.□Equilibrium conditions can be derived as follows: givenD1∗in Eq. (A.2),(A.5)E[U1]>E[U2]⇔D1∗>s2(I+K)⇔D1∗>s2(I+γD1)⇔D1∗>s2I1-γs2⇔(1-γ)s2I1-γs2-s1I<dαs2I1-γs2(1-s1I-γs2I1-γs2)(fromFig. 11)∴d>(1-γ)s2-s1(1-γs2)αs21-s1+γs21-γs2I≔g1o(I).The searchers’ demand for SE2 can be found using Eq. 2:(A.6)D2∗=s2(γD1∗+I)(1-γD1∗-s1I),whereD1∗is specified by Eq. (A.2).□We can solve for searchers’ demand for SE1 by using Eqs. (3)–(5):(A.7)D1=(K+s1I+d(1-K-s1I)A)(1-s2I)=(γD1+s1I+d(1-γD1-s1I)A)(1-s2I)⇔D1-s1I(1-s2I)=(1-s2I)D1{γ+αd(1-s1I-γD1)}(A.8)∴D1=B+B2+4αdγs1I(1-s2I)22(1-s2I)αdγ,whereB=-1+αd(1-s1I)(1-s2I)+γ(1-s2I). The searchers’ demand for SE2 is just its expected utility:D2∗=s2I.To derive the equilibrium conditions under whichE[U1]<E[U2]is sustained, we use Eq. (A.7): givenD1∗in Eq. (A.8),E[U1]<E[U2]⇔D1∗<s2I(1-s2I).From Fig. 12,(A.9)D1∗<s2I(1-s2I)⇔s2I(1-s2I)-s1I(1-s2I)>(1-s2I)s2I(1-s2I){γ+αd(1-s1I-γs2I(1-s2I))}∴d<(1-γ)s2-s1+γs22Iαs2(1-s2I){1-(s1+γs2(1-s2I))I}≔g2c(I).□We can findD1in equilibrium from Eq. (3):(A.10)D1=E[U1](1-s2(I+K))+E[U2]s2K=(K+s1I+d(1-K-s1I)A)(1-s2(I+K))+s2(K+I)s2K⇔{1-s2γ(s2-s1)I-(1-s2I)(γ+dα(1-s1I))}D1-s1I(1-s2I)=D12{γ2αds2D1-γ2s2(1-s2)-αdγ((1-s1I)s2+(1-s2I))}Fig. 13shows the graphs of the left-hand and right-hand sides of Eq. (A.10), which has two positive solutions, the smaller one of which isD1∗because the larger one is greater than one. To show this, we verify that the positiveD1-intercept of the third-order polynomial, or the right-hand side of Eq. (A.10), is greater than one, as follows: ifD1tis theD1-intercept, thenγ2αds2D1t=γ2s2(1-s2)-αdγ((1-s1I)s2+(1-s2I))∴D1t>1-s1Iγ>1(byAssumption3.1)We need to find the equilibrium conditions under which searchers’ expectations ofE[U1]<E[U2]are satisfied: GivenD1∗∈0,1, satisfying Eq. (A.10),E[U1]<E[U2]⇔D1∗-E[U2]s2K1-s2(I+K)<E[U2]⇔D1∗<E[U2](1-s2I)⇔D1∗<(s2I+s2γD1)(1-s2I)⇔D1∗<s2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I).From Fig. 13, replacingD1in Eq. (A.10) bys2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I)leads to the following equilibrium condition:D1∗<s2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I)⇔{1-s2γ(s2-s1)I-(1-s2I)(γ+dα(1-s1I))}s2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I)-s1I(1-s2I)>s2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I)2{γ2αds2s2I(1-s2I)1-s2γ(1-s2I)-γ2s2(1-s2)-αdγ((1-s1I)s2+(1-s2I))}∴d<(1-γs2+γs22I){(1-γ(1-s1))s2-s1+γ(1-s1)s22I}αs2(1-s2I){1-γs2-(s1+γs2(1-s2I)-γs2(s1+s2)+γs1s22I)I}≔g2o(I).□For the sufficient conditions to be valid, the fulfilled-expectations equilibrium in which SE1 with a closed knowledge-sharing service is the first choice of searchers should first be sustainable. Proposition 1 provides the following condition under which there exists an equilibrium in which SE1 with a closed knowledge-sharing service is the first choice of searchers:(A.11)d>g1c(I)=(1-γ)s2-s1αs2{1-(s1+γs2)I}.When the above condition holds, according to the proof of Proposition 1, SE1’s demand is given as follows:D1k=-(1-γ-dα(1-s1I))+(1-γ-dα(1-s1I))2+4γαds1I2γdα.Now, we need to compare the profit gained by introducing a closed knowledge-sharing service (when SE1 is the first choice of searchers in equilibrium) and that of increasing the engine’s search quality level to one of the optimal levels specified by Proposition 5.First, when the expressionc⩾I(1-s+2I)2s0holds, SE1 will strictly choose to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service ifD1k-Ck>π1(s0), which leads to the following equivalent condition for the number of answers per searcher (γ):(A.12)γ>1-αd(1-s0I)-s0ICk+s0I(1-s2I)1-αd(Ck+s0I(1-s2I)).We can rewrite equilibrium condition (A.11) as follows:(A.13)γ>1-αd-s0(1-αds2I)s21-αds2I.IfCk⩽s2I-s0I(1-s2I), the denominator of the right-hand side of Eq. (A.12) is equal to or greater than that of the right-hand side of Eq. (A.13). The numerator of the right-hand side of Eq. (A.12) is equal to or less than that of the right-hand side of Eq. (A.13). Thus, if Eq. (A.13) holds, and SE1 is the first choice of searchers after introducing a closed knowledge-sharing service, Eq. (A.12) holds automatically.Second, when the expressionI(1-s2I)2s2<c<I(1-s2I)2s0holds, SE1 will strictly choose to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service ifD1k-Ck>π1(s1m), wheres1m=I(1-s2I)2candπ1(s1m)=s1mI(1-s2I)-c({s1m}2-s02). Suppose that the expressionCk⩽c({s1m}2-s02)holds. Then, ifD1k>s1mI(1-s+2I), SE1 will choose to develop a knowledge-sharing service to maximize its profit. We can verify that(A.14)D1k>s1mI(1-s+2I)⇔s0>I2c(1-s2I)2{1-γ-dα(1-γI2(1-s2I)22c)}1-dαI2(1-s2I)22c.Equilibrium condition (A.11) can be written as(A.15)s0>s2{1-γ-dα(1-γs2I)}1-dαs2I.Because the relationshipI(1-s2I)2c<s2holds, the right-hand side of Eq. (A.15) is greater than that of Eq. (A.14). Thus, once SE1 with a closed knowledge-sharing service is the first choice of searchers, SE1 also maximizes its profits if the conditionCk⩽c({s1m}2-s02)holds.Lastly, when the conditionc⩽I(1-s2I)2s2holds, SE1 will choose the option of introducing a closed knowledge-sharing service to increase its profit ifD1k-s2I(1-s2I)is greater thanCk-c(s22-s02). Suppose that the expressionCk⩽c(s22-s02)holds. Then, as long as the expressionD1k>s2I(1-s2I)holds, SE1 will choose to introduce a closed knowledge-sharing service. We can show that(A.16)D1k>s2I(1-s2I)⇔s0>s2(1-s2I){1-γ-dα(1-γs2I(1-s2I))}1-dαs2I(1-s2I).The right-hand side of inequality (A.16) is less than that of the equilibrium condition (A.15). Thus, the final sufficient condition, (10), holds. Q.E.D.
