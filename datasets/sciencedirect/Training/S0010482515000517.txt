@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a new method to help physicians assess, using a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan image, whether or not there is bile reflux into the stomach. The degree of bile reflux is an important index for clinical diagnosis of stomach diseases. The proposed method applies image-processing technology combined with a hydrodynamic model to determine the extent of bile reflux or whether the duodenum is also folded above the stomach. This condition in 2D dynamic images suggests that bile refluxes into the stomach, when endoscopy shows no bile reflux. In this study, we used optical flow to analyze images from Tc99m-diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid cholescintigraphy (Tc99m-DISIDA) to ascertain the direction and velocity of bile passing through the pylorus. In clinical diagnoses, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the main clinical tool for evaluating functional images of hepatobiliary metabolism. Computed tomography (CT) shows anatomical images of the external contours of the stomach, liver, and biliary extent. By exploiting the functional fusion of the two kinds of medical image, physicians can obtain a more accurate diagnosis. We accordingly reconstructed 3D images from SPECT and CT to help physicians choose which cross sections to fuse with software and to help them more accurately diagnose the extent and quantity of bile reflux.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The cause of bile reflux gastritis is uncontrolled bile reflux into the stomach. When alkaline bile moves through the pylorus into the stomach, it can destroy the stomach mucosa solidity, posing the risk of gastritis that may eventually turn into cancer. Bile reflux may lead to mucosal injury and may appear with surgical excision of part of the stomach and the failure of the pylorus [1]. For this reason, physicians want to detect bile reflux as early as possible. From the fluid mechanics point of view, normal bile can be considered as a Newtonian fluid, and an increase in bile viscosity is an important factor in bile stone pathology [2,3]. Ooi et al. presented 2D and 3D computational models for bile flow in different geometrical cases of the cystic duct as a channel with baffles [4]. Li et al. simulated Newtonian and non-Newtonian bile flow in the cystic duct. They presented a model for analyzing bile flow at a T junction with rigid and flexible walls [5]. Agarwal et al. developed a mathematical model of bile flow, considering bile as a Herschelâ€“Bulkley fluid in a constricted channel [6]. Maiti and Misra [7] presented a peristaltic flow motion model to evaluate the influence of critical pressure, porosity parameter, and bile velocity on reflux. Physicians are used to judging bile flow motion from diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA) images. If bile reflux is not serious, physicians cannot easily judge whether or not the bile flow is passing through the pylorus without analysis of SPECT DISIDA images. Physicians can easily judge the position of the stomach from CT images but cannot determine the bile flow to the stomach from SPECT images alone. The present study aimed to integrate CT and SPECT images to accurately find the position of the stomach and to determine whether or not there is reflux of bile into the stomach. Although instruments able to merge SPECT and CT, the procedure is very expensive, reflecting the high cost of the instruments to hospitals. For this reason, an interface is used to help physicians fuse DISIDA and SPECT images. Digital medical images are becoming increasingly more important to physicians, who use them to assess the severity of many diseases.Fig. 1 shows a flow chart of the analysis system proposed in this study. The system was built with MATLAB 7. In the system, we processed the dynamic DISIDA images using the proposed methods. This system can help doctors to estimate duodenogastric reflux and quantify the duodenogastric reflux easily.
