@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents fully fuzzy fixed charge multi-item solid transportation problems (FFFCMISTPs), in which direct costs, fixed charges, supplies, demands, conveyance capacities and transported quantities (decision variables) are fuzzy in nature. Objective is to minimize the total fuzzy cost under fuzzy decision variables. In this paper, some approaches are proposed to find the fully fuzzy transported amounts for a fuzzy solid transportation problem (FSTP). Proposed approaches are applicable for both balanced and unbalanced FFFCMISTPs. Another fuzzy fixed charge multi-item solid transportation problem (FFCMISTP) in which transported amounts (decision variables) are not fuzzy is also presented and solved by some other techniques. The models are illustrated with numerical examples and nature of the solutions is discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The solid transportation problem (STP) is a generalization of the well-known transportation problem (TP) in which three kinds of constraint sets exist instead of two (source and destination) as in TP [14]. This extra constraint is mainly due to modes of transportation (conveyances). The STP was first stated by Schell [28]. Haley [11] showed a comparison of the STP to the classical TP and applied Modi-method to solve the STP. In a TP when fixed charge is considered against transportation of units from a source to destination, the problem is transformed to fixed charge TP (FCTP). The FCTP was initialized by Hirsch and Dantzig [13]. Up to now, several approaches are followed to solve FCTP [17,29,10]. In STP fixed charge is also considered and solved by several researchers in crisp as well as uncertain environments. Yang and Liu [30] developed fuzzy fixed charge STP and developed algorithms to solve the problem using possibility and credibility measure on fuzzy sets. Durai Raj et al. [6] presented some fast heuristic algorithms to solve a single-stage fixed charge transportation problem and compared their performances with the existing best method by making use of benchmark problem instances.In a STP when more than one item are stored at different depots and are transported to different destinations using different types of conveyances, the problem reduces to multi-item STP (MISTP). Though extensive research works have been made by several researchers on STP, a little attention has been paid on MISTP [19]. In a MISTP when fixed charge is considered against transportation of units from a source to destination, the problem is transformed to fixed charge MISTP (FCMISTP). Again the problem becomes more complicated when it is considered in fuzzy environment. Though some authors considered and solved fuzzy fixed charge solid transportation problems, none has considered FFFCMISTP.Fuzzy TPs are a class of fuzzy linear programming problem (FLPP). There are some research works where fuzzy solutions are derived for FLPP. When fuzzy decision is required for FLPP, then it is termed as FFLPP. Kumar et al. [18] presented an algorithm for solving FFLPP in which some or all the parameters are represented by unrestricted L-R flat fuzzy numbers. Dehghan et al. [5] developed computational methods for solving fully fuzzy linear systems. Allahviranloo et al. [1] considered the ranking function to solve FFLPP. Lotfi et al. [23] presented lexicography method and fuzzy approximate solution to solve FFLPP. Ezzati et al. [8] developed an algorithm to solve FFLPP using the MOLP problem but none has found fuzzy solution for FSTP. On the other hand when the source, demands and conveyance capacities are imprecise, the transported amounts automatically demand to be imprecise as the sums of the transported quantities satisfy the fuzzy source amounts and fuzzy demands in equality or inequality sense. This phenomenon has been ignored by the researchers. The fuzzy FCMISTP in which all parameters as well as the decision variables are represented by fuzzy numbers is known as fully FFCMISTP (FFFCMISTP). FFFCMISTP can be divided into two categories: (1) FFFCMISTP with inequality constraints i.e. unbalanced FFFCMISTP and (2) FFFCMISTP with equality constraints i.e. balanced FFFCSTP.From above discussion, there are some lacunas in the existing STP models, which are summarized below.•Though some researchers investigated FLPP [2,7,9,25–27] and FFLPP [1,8,12,16,23], none has studied the FFFCMISTP with equality and inequality type fuzzy constraints.In the literature, there are several transportation research papers with fuzzy resources, demands, conveyances capacities, but none has investigated FFFCMISTP problems with the decision variable (amount of transported quantity) as fuzzy.Attention of the earlier research workers was on the minimization of total transportation cost in FFCSTP. Till now, none has studied the minimization of transportation cost as well as minimization of fuzziness of the solution, specially for FFFCMISTP.Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 gives the literature survey and gist of the paper. In Section 2, some preliminaries and deductions required for mathematical formulation of the models are presented. In Section 3, assumptions and notations of the proposed FFFCMISTP models are listed. In Section 4, mathematical formulation of the proposed FFFCMISTP models are presented. Imprecise optimization problems arising from the models are transformed into equivalent deterministic optimization problems in Section 5. To illustrate the proposed methods, numerical examples are solved in Section 6 and sensitivity analysis are presented in Section 7. The obtained results are discussed in Section 8. In Section 9, results of some existing problems are verified with the results obtained by proposed approaches. Some conclusions are made in Section 10.A fuzzy numberA˜is a convex normalized fuzzy setA˜of the real lineR, with membership functionμA˜:R→[0,1], satisfying the following conditions:•There exists exactly one intervalI∈Rsuch thatμA˜(x)=1, ∀x∈I.The membership functionμA˜(x)is piecewise continuous.A TFNA˜is specified by three parameters (a1, a2, a3) and is defined by its continuous membership functionμA˜(x):X→[0,1]as follows:μA˜(x)=x−a1a2−a1fora1≤x≤a2a3−xa3−a2fora2≤x≤a30otherwiseLetA˜be a fuzzy number with membership functionμA˜(x)then its α-cut is denoted byA˜(α)=[AL(α),AR(α)], and is defined asAL(α)=inf{x∈R:μA˜(x)≥α}AR(α)=sup{x∈R:μA˜(x)≥α}IfA˜,B˜∈RandC˜=f(A˜,B˜)wheref:R×R⟶Rbe a binary operation then membership functionμC˜ofC˜is defined asμC˜(z)=sup{min(μA˜(x),μB˜(y)),x,y∈Randz=f(x,y),∀z∈R}Credibility measure was presented by Liu and Liu [22]. LetA˜be fuzzy variable with membership functionμA˜(x). Then for any set B ⊂ R of real numbers, credibility measure of fuzzy event{A˜∈B}is defined asCr{A˜∈B}=(1/2)(Pos{A˜∈B}+Nec{A˜∈B}), where possibility and necessity measures of{A˜∈B}are respectively defined asPos{A˜∈B}=supx∈BμA˜(x)&Nec{A˜∈B}=1−supA˜∈BcμA˜(x).Credibility distribution curve (cf. Fig. 1) as presented above where r is a crisp number,A˜is a triangular fuzzy variable given byA˜=(a1,a2,a3), 0≤a1≤a2≤a3.Cr(A˜≤r)=0ifr≤a1r−a12(a2−a1)ifa1≤r≤a2r+a3−2a22(a3−a2)ifa2≤r≤a31ifr≥a3LetA˜be a fuzzy variable and β∈(0, 1]. Then β-optimistic value ofA˜is denoted byA˜sup(β)and defined asA˜sup(β)=sup{r:Cr{A˜≥r}≥β}Similarly β pessimistic value ofA˜is denoted byA˜inf(β)and defined asA˜inf(β)=inf{r:Cr{A˜≤r}≥β}Lemma 1LetA˜=(a1,a2,a3)be a triangular fuzzy variable. Then its β-optimistic value isA˜sup(β)=2βa2+(1−2β)a3,ifβ≤0.5(2β−1)a1+2(1−β)a2,ifβ>0.5Lemma 2LetA˜=(a1,a2,a3)be a triangular fuzzy variable. Then its β-pessimistic value isA˜inf(β)=(1−2β)a1+2βa2,ifβ≤0.52(1−β)a2+(2β−1)a3,ifβ>0.5LetA˜be a normalized fuzzy variable. The graded mean integration value (GMIV) or expected value of the fuzzy variableA˜is denoted byE[A˜]and is defined asE[A˜]=∫0∞Cr(A˜≥r)dr−∫−∞0Cr(A˜≤r)drLemma 3[25]LetA˜=(a1,a2,a3)is a TFN. The expected value ofA˜isE[A˜]=12[ρa1+a2+(1−ρ)a3]where0≤ρ≤1IfA˜be a fuzzy number with α-cutA˜[α]=[AL(α),AR(α)]then modified graded mean integration value of the fuzzy numberA˜is denoted byPρ(A˜)and is defined asPρ(A˜)=∫01α[ρAL(α)+(1−ρ)AR(α)]dα∫01αdα=13{ρ×a1+2×a2+(1−ρ)×a3}where ρ∈[0, 1] is the decision attitude or optimism parameter. This method is known as ρ-preference integration representation andPρ(A)˜is termed as modified graded mean integrated value (MGMIV).A triangular fuzzy numberA˜=(a1,a2,a3)is said to be a non-negative triangular fuzzy number if and only if a1≥0. The set of all these triangular fuzzy numbers is denoted by TFN.Two triangular fuzzy numbersA˜=(a1,a2,a3)andB˜=(b1,b2,b3)are said to be equal,A˜=B˜, if and only if a1=b1, a2=b2 and a3=b3The arithmetic operations between two triangular fuzzy numbers are defined by the extension principle. It can be equivalently represented as follows, where ⊕, ⊖, ⊗ represent addition, subtraction and multiplication operator on fuzzy numbers andA˜=(a1,a2,a3),B˜=(b1,b2,b3)are two TFNs, k∈R.(i)k>=0,kA˜=(ka1,ka2,ka3),k<=0,kA˜=(ka3,ka2,ka1),A˜⊕B˜=(a1+b1,a2+b2,a3+b3),A˜⊖B˜=(a1−b3,a2−b2,a3−b1),LetA˜=(a1,a2,a3)be an arbitrary triangular fuzzy number andB˜=(b1,b2,b3)be a non-negative triangular fuzzy number, thenA˜⊗B˜=(a1b1,a2b2,a3b3)ifa1≥0(a1b3,a2b2,a3b3)ifa1<0,a3≥0(a1b3,a2b2,a3b1)ifb1<0LetA˜be a general fuzzy number with α-cut [AL(α), AR(α)], this according to Ma et al. [24] its nearest symmetric TFN is (x0−σ, x0, x0+σ) where x0 and σ are given byx0=12[AR(α)+AL(α)],σ=32∫01[AR(α)−AL(α)](1−α)dαAccording to the definition for triangular fuzzy numberA˜=(a1,a2,a3), x0=(1/4)(a1+2a2+a3) and σ=(1/2)(a3−a1).The FFFCMISTP takes two types of costs into consideration; the direct cost and the fixed charge. The direct cost is the cost with respect to per unit transported amount. The fixed charge arises when the transportation activity between a source and a destination by a conveyance occurs. In order to construct the mathematical model for the unbalanced FFFCMISTP, the following notations are introduced:(i)M: number of origins/sources of the transportation problem.N: number of destinations/demands of the transportation problem.K: number of conveyances i.e. different modes of transporting units from sources to destinations.P: number of items involved in the transportation problem.Aip: amount available at the ith origin for pth item.Bjp: demand at the jth destination for pth item.Ek: amount of the product which can be carried by kth conveyance.Cijkp1: per unit transportation cost from ith origin to jth destination by kth conveyance for pth item.fijk: fixed transportation charge for transporting units from ith origin to jth destination by kth conveyance.xijkp: the amount transported from ith origin to jth destination by kth conveyance for pth item.E(A˜)represents GMIV of a fuzzy variableA˜.Pρ(A˜)represents MGMIV of a fuzzy variableA˜.If the transportation activity is assigned from source i to destination j by conveyance k for pth item, then the fixed charge will be costed. This implies that if∑p=1Pxijkp>0we must add the fixed charge to the total transportation cost. Thus for the convenience of modelling, the following notation is introduced:yijk=1for∑p=1Pxijkp>00otherwiseFollowing the above assumptions and notations, a FFFCMISTP, with objective cost which is to be minimized takes the following different forms according to the types of different parameters.In this model, fixed charge, unit transportation cost and transport quantity are crisp. Sources, destinations, conveyances capacities of transportation problem are also taken as crisp. So the crisp model mathematically takes the following form:(1)MinimizeZ=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{Cijkp1xijkp}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{fijkyijk}subject to∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp≤Aip(i=1,2,…,M;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp≥Bjp(j=1,2,…,N;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Pxijkp≤Ek(k=1,2,…,K)xijkp≥0((i,j,k,p)=1,2,…,(M,N,K,P))In this model, fixed charge, unit transportation cost and transport quantities (decision variables) are fuzzy. Sources, destinations, conveyances capacities of transportation problem are also taken as fuzzy. So the above crisp model is transformed to fully fuzzy model. So the Model-I mathematically takes the following form:(2)MinimizeZ˜=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{C˜ijkp1⊗x˜ijkp}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{f˜ijkyijk}=(Z1,Z2,Z3)(3)subject to∑j=1N∑k=1Kx˜ijkp≤A˜ip(i=1,2,…,M;p=1,2,…,P)(4)∑i=1M∑k=1Kx˜ijkp≥B˜jp(j=1,2,…,N;p=1,2,…,P)(5)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Px˜ijkp≤E˜k(k=1,2,…,K)(6)x˜ijkp≥0((i,j,k,p)=1,2,…,(M,N,K,P))whereC˜ijkp1=(Cijkp11,Cijkp21,Cijkp31),x˜ijkp=(xijkp1,xijkp2,xijkp3),f˜ijk=(fijk1,fijk2,fijk3),Z1=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{Cijkp11xijkp1}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{fijk1yijk},Z2=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{Cijkp21xijkp2}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{fijk2yijk},Z3=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{Cijkp31xijkp3}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{fijk3yijk},This model is equivalent to Model-I except transport quantities (decision variables) are deterministic. So the Model-II mathematically takes the following form:(7)MinimizeZ¯˜=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1P{C˜ijkp1xijkp}+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K{f˜ijkyijk}=(Z¯1,Z¯2,Z¯3)subject to∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp≤A˜ip(i=1,2,…,M;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp≥B˜jp(j=1,2,…,N;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Pxijkp≤E˜k(k=1,2,…,K)xijk≥0((i,j,k)=1,2,…,(M,N,K))whereZ¯1=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1PCijkp11xijkp+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1Kfijk1yijkZ¯2=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1PCijkp21xijkp+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1Kfijk2yijkZ¯3=∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1PCijkp31xijkp+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1Kfijk3yijkAs optimization of fully fuzzy/fuzzy objective with fully fuzzy/fuzzy constraints are not well defined, Models-I and -II can not be solved in the present form.Deterministic equivalents of Model-I are derived here by the following different approaches.In this approach, objective function of Model-I is replaced using credibility measure of fuzzy events with degree of credibility β. The fuzzy event must hold if its credibility is 1, and fail if its credibility is 0. Decisions maker (DM) is more optimistic or pessimistic he/she considers value of β near to 0 or 1. Unbalanced problem (2–6) can be reduced to a balanced problem by introducing slack variabless˜ip(i=1,2,3,…,M;p=1,2,3,…,P)for constraints (3), surplus variablest˜jp(j=1,2,3,…,N;p=1,2,3,…,P)for constraints (4) and slack variablesu˜k(k=1, 2, 3, …, K) for constraints (5). So using this approach, deterministic equivalent of Model-I is as below:(8)Minimizefsubject toCr∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1K∑p=1PC˜ijkp1⊗x˜ijkp+∑i=1M∑j=1N∑k=1Kf˜ijkyijk]≤f≥β∑j=1N∑k=1Kx˜ijkp⊕sip˜=A˜ip(i=1,2,…,M;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kx˜ijkp⊖tjp˜=B˜jp(j=1,2,…,N;p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Px˜ijkp⊕uk˜=E˜k(k=1,2,…,K)(x˜ijkp,s˜ip,t˜jp,u˜k)≥0If all the parametersA˜ip,B˜jp,E˜k,s˜ip,t˜jp,u˜kare represented by triangular fuzzy numbers (Aip1, Aip2, Aip3)(Bjp1, Bjp2, Bjp3), (Ek1, Ek2, Ek3), (sip1sip2, sip3), (tjp1, tjp2, tjp3) and (uk1, uk2, uk3) respectively then the FFFCMISTP may be written as:(9)MinimizeZ˜inf(β)s.t.∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp1,∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp2,∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp3)+(sip1,sip2,sip3=(Aip1,Aip2,Aip3)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp1,∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp2,∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp3−(tjp1,tjp2,tjp3)=(Bj1,Bj2,Bj3)∑i=1M∑j=1Nxijkp1,∑i=1M∑j=1Nxijkp2,∑i=1M∑j=1Nxijkp3+(uk1,uk2,uk3)=(Ek1,Ek2,Ek3)and(10)xijkp2−xijkp1≥0,xijkp3−xijkp2≥0,xijkp1,sip1,tjp1,ukp1≥0,sip2−sip1≥0,sip3−sip2≥0,ti2−ti1≥0,ti3−tip2≥0,uip2−uip1≥0,ui3−ui2≥0(i=1,2,…,M;j=1,2,…,N;k=1,2,…,K;p=1,2,…,P)In the above model, the objective is defuzzified using credibility measure and constraints are defuzzified using fuzzy equality definition, arithmetic operations (cf. Section 2.10 and 2.11) and Lemma 2. Hence final reduced form of the model is(11)MinimizeZ˜inf(β)s.t.∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp1+sip1=Aip1(i=1,2,…,M,p=1,2,…,P)∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp2+sip2=Aip2(i=1,2,…,M,p=1,2,…,P)∑j=1N∑k=1Kxijkp3+sip3=Aip3(i=1,2,…,M,p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp1−tjp3=Bjp1(j=1,2,…,N,p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp2−tjp2=Bjp2(j=1,2,…,N,p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑k=1Kxijkp3−tjp1=Bj3(j=1,2,…,N,p=1,2,…,P)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Pxijkp1+uk1=Ek1(k=1,2,…,K)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Pxijkp2+uk2=Ek2(k=1,2,…,K)∑i=1M∑j=1N∑p=1Pxijkp3+uk3=Ek3(k=1,2,…,K)and constraints (10).Case-1: 0<β≤0.5(12)Minimize(1−2β)Z1+2βZ2s.t.Constraints of problem (11).Case-2: 0.5≤β≤1(13)Minimize2(1−β)Z2+(2β−1)Z3s.t.Constraints of problem (11).In this approach, GMIV or expected values of the objective function of the Model-I is minimized using Lemma 3.

Different assumed parametric values for the example are presented below.Example: Here two sources (i.e. M=2), two destinations (i.e. N=2), two conveyances (i.e. K=2) and two items (i.e. p=2) are considered. Fuzzy unit transportation costs and fixed charge for Models-I,-II are given in Table 1. For credibility measure of constraints, value of β is taken as 0.9 (Table 2).With the above input data, the transportation Models-IA, IB, IC, ID and IIA, IIB, IIC, IID are solved by Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method and the optimum costs along with corresponding transported amounts are presented in Tables 3 and 4respectively.Changing the value of β in credibility measure, the parameter ρ in GMIV and MGMIV, the Models -IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB and IIC are evaluated and the optimum values are presented in Table 5. Satisfied demands/deficit demands for Models-I and -II are presented in Table 6. In our formulation, ρ in GMIV and MGMIV indicates degree of optimism and cost decreases with the value of ρ. In particular, when ρ=0 and ρ=1, the values of objective represent the view points of pessimistic and optimistic decision maker respectively. When ρ=0.5, objective represents the decision of a moderate decision maker. Instead of the possibility and necessity, we have considered the credibility measure also as consideration of credibility measure method is superior than that of possibility /necessity [30]. This is because fuzziness of an event exists even if its credibility is 1., where as fuzziness becomes zero when possibility and necessity becomes either 1 or zero. However, fuzziness becomes zero when its credibility is zero. Here, the minimization of total transportation costs is evaluated for different values of credibility measure, the cost increases with the values of β.
