@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a progressive disease that may result in Chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytokeratin(CK)18 is an intermediary filament protein, expressed in hepatocytes, which is proteolytically cleaved during liver damage. M30 epitope of cytokeratin18(CK18-M30) is involved at different levels in apoptotic pathways. The aim of this study to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of cytokeratin 18-apoptosin M30 fragments (CK18-M30) as non-invasive method of liver fibrosis assessment and their correlation to METAVIR score. Serum concentrations of CK18-M30 were measured by ELISA in One hundred and sixty eight chronic hepatitis C patients (112 males and 56 females). Results showed that serum concentrations of CK18 were significantly increased in a stepwise fashion from A0 to A3 and from F0 to F4.There was highly significant positive correlation between CK18 and fibrosis stages (r = 0.881 & p < 0.001) and activity grades (r = 0.881 & p < 0.001). Also, serum CK18 correlated positively with serum levels of transaminases (r = 0.355 & p < 0.05). CK18 was correlated positively with viral level (r = 0.3 & p < 0.05). It was concluded that Elevated serum CK18-M30, as an indicator of enhanced apoptosis of hepatocytes, was increased and correlated significantly with inflammation severity, stages of fibrosis, transaminases (ALT) levels and viral load in chronic HCV patients. These findings may place CK18-M30 as a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis and disease activity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a progressive disease that may result in chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is estimated nationally that over 200 million people are infected and about 80% progress into chronic form [20]. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the world, estimated nationally at 14.7% [15].Cytokeratin (CK18) is major intermediate filament protein in liver cells. It is expressed in hepatocytes by both apoptosis and necrosis which are the triggering for the inflammatory condition, regeneration and liver fibrosis [1].The apoptotic pathway is composed of two arms, intrinsic and extrinsic one. In the final common step of apoptosis, CK18 which is expressed by hepatocytes is cleaved resulting in exposure of its M30 fragment and because of the liver is highly perfused organ, it accumulates very rapidly in the circulation of patients with chronic liver disease including HCV infection [5,23].Human Apoptosense M30 is an ELISA based monoclonal antibody [13]. This antibody specifically binds to the cleaved CK18 fragments but not to the uncleaved fragments providing a non invasive, simple and quantitative test for hepatocyte death [8,11].Liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosis, assessment of severity of liver injury as well as monitoring of therapy although, it has many complications [7]. So, the presence of non invasive, simple and low cost test is highly needed [9].Serum Cytokeratin 18-Apoptosense M30 would define the apoptotic process [23]and by finding its correlation with the severity of inflammation, staging of fibrosis it would replace liver biopsy making it unnecessary in many instances providing serum biomarker for diagnosis of liver injury and treatment monitoring.Aim of this study was to assess the levels of Caspase-cleaved fragments of CK-18 in the sera of patients with chronic HCV infection and evaluate its correlation with hepatocyte apoptosis and any correlations with stages of fibrosis and grades of inflammation.The study involved 168 patients with chronic hepatitis C recruited from Tropical Medicine department, Mansoura University Hospitals during the period from January 2013 to January 2014 (112 male and 56 female) with age ranged between 23 and 56 years. An informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.
