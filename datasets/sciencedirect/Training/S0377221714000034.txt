@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a memetic algorithm is developed to solve the orienteering problem with hotel selection (OPHS). The algorithm consists of two levels: a genetic component mainly focuses on finding a good sequence of intermediate hotels, whereas six local search moves embedded in a variable neighborhood structure deal with the selection and sequencing of vertices between the hotels. A set of 176 new and larger benchmark instances of OPHS are created based on optimal solutions of regular orienteering problems. Our algorithm is applied on these new instances as well as on 224 benchmark instances from the literature. The results are compared with the known optimal solutions and with the only other existing algorithm for this problem. The results clearly show that our memetic algorithm outperforms the existing algorithm in terms of solution quality and computational time. A sensitivity analysis shows the significant impact of the number of possible sequences of hotels on the difficulty of an OPHS instance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Orienteering Problem with Hotel Selection (OPHS) is a recently introduced variant of the orienteering problem (Divsalar, Vansteenwegen, & Cattrysse, 2013). In this problem, on a given complete graph G=(V,E), a set of h+n vertices is given. V=H∪N is composed of two subsets including h hotels, represented by numbers from 0 to h−1, and n points of interests (POI), represented by numbers from h to h+n−1. Hotel 0 and hotel 1 are used as the initial and the final depot respectively; the other hotels are called “extra hotels”. Each POI is assigned a score Si. The symmetric travel time needed between each pair of vertices is given by tij. These travel times can be based on Euclidean distances or a travel time matrix. An ordered set of POIs with a specific start and end hotel is called a trip. The length of each trip d=1,…,D is limited by a given time budget Td. Each of the D connected trips starts and ends in one of the h hotels. The ordered set of trips that starts in the initial depot and ends in the final depot is called a tour. Both the initial and final depot can also be used as an intermediate hotel during the tour. The objective is to find a given number of connected trips visiting each POI at most once and maximizing the sum of collected scores.Some examples of the large number of potential applications of the OPHS are explained in Divsalar et al. (2013): a submarine performing a surveillance activity composed of consecutive missions, the design of a multi-day tourist trip through an attractive region, or a traveling salesperson who needs to select which of his possible clients to visit during his multiple day tour and also needs to choose the most appropriate hotels to stay the night.We start this paper with an extensive literature survey on the OPHS and closely related problems. In Section 3 our heuristic algorithm is explained. Benchmark instances, experimental tests and a sensitivity analysis of the problem instance parameters are presented and discussed in Section 4 and the paper is concluded in Section 5.
