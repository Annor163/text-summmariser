@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The prehensile hand gestures play an important role in daily living for seizing or holding subjects stably. In order to realize the accurate recognition of eight prehensile hand gestures with a minimal number of electrodes, an off-line myoelectric control system with only two electrodes is developed. We choose Mean Absolute Value, Variance, the fourth-order Autoregressive Coefficient, Zero Crossings, Mean Frequency and Middle Frequency as original electromyography feature set and utilize the linear discriminant analysis to reduce the dimension and complete classification. The extent of dimension reduction is investigated and on the premise of it, the average accuracy can achieve 97.46% in the recognition of six hand gestures. The optimal feature set based on the original feature set is determined to be Mean Absolute Value, Variance, and the fourth-order Autoregressive Coefficient, which yields an average accuracy of 95.94% in the recognition of eight hand gestures. An average method is proposed to improve the accuracy further, resulting in the average accuracy in eight gestures being 98.12% and the best individual accuracy of some hand gestures being 100%.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The surface electromyography (EMG) signal as a noninvasive electrical biosignal has been widely used in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders [1,2] and controlling peripheral devices [3], especially prosthetic limb [4]. During the past four decades, the multifunctional anthropomorphic prosthetic hands have made tremendous development. A proper myoelectric control system may enable upper-limb amputees restore the interaction capability and improve their lives [5]. Nowadays several prosthetic hands have been reported in literature [6–12], whose appearance and size were all similar to human hand. These hands had 8-degree of freedoms (DOFs) at least and could perform prehensile postures for activities of daily living.To meet the increasing DOFs of prosthetic hands and provide more reliable and dexterous control, the myoelectric control strategies have also gained great development, from the primal method based on amplitude [13] to the popular method based on pattern recognition [14]. The EMG pattern recognition method should include some fundamental processing parts (data preprocessing, data windowing, feature extraction and classification) shown in Fig. 1[14].The good classification performance depends very much on the selection and extraction of features. A variety of EMG features have been proposed. They can be divided into three categories: time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain [3]. Features in time domain are calculated from raw EMG time series. The computational complexity is acceptable. Hudgins et al. [15] had proven that time domain features were effective in recognition of four forearm movements with an average accuracy rate of 91% by using Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Mean Absolute Value Slope (MAVS), Zero Crossings (ZC), Slope Sign Changes (SSC) and Waveform Length (WL). Kim et al. [16] used Integrated Absolute Value and Root Mean Square (RMS), to recognize four wrist motions successfully. Features in time domain are based on the assuming that the EMG signal is stationary, which is actually not. Therefore time domain features may vary greatly [17]. Features in frequency domain which mainly contain Mean Frequency (MNF), Middle Frequency (MDF) and Autoregressive (AR) coefficient, usually reflect the recruitment of motor unit (MU) and the fatigue of the muscle [17]. Different contraction level and different hand gesture correspond to different MU recruitment. Hence frequency domain features can be utilized to recognize hand gesture. Pang et al. [18] recognized forearm and wrist motions by using AR. Features in time-frequency domain usually contain the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). They can be used to analyze EMG signal in both time and frequency domain. Karimi et al. [19] used WPT to decompose raw EMG signal and obtained WPT coefficients. The standard deviation of WPT coefficients was then utilized to train artificial neural network with the combination of genetic algorithm. He gained an accuracy of over 98% in the recognition of ten upper-limb movements. In addition, high-order statistic concepts can also be used to analyze the EMG signals. Orosco et al. [20] used the bispectrum as a feature to classify five upper limb movements and gained good classification rates.The majority of EMG study focused on forearm, wrist and gross hand motions recognition [15,16,18,19]. Although they obtained high accuracy, these motions were not suitable to control a dexterous prosthetic hand to complete prehensile hand gestures in a natural way. Hence recognition of individual finger or multi-finger motions have drawn attention in recent research [21–23]. Khushaba et al. [21] used two channels to collect surface EMG signals and recognized ten individual finger and combined finger movements. Various features were extracted from raw EMG data, and 92% off-line and 90% on-line classification accuracy were achieved by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Bayesian fusion. Chen and Wang [22] successfully recognized ten Chinese number gestures, which were combined finger motions, with 97.93% off-line accuracy and 90% on-line accuracy. These individual finger and combined finger motions may be promising for human–computer interaction, but these motions could not satisfy the prehensile need in daily living. Therefore, the recognition of multi-finger prehensile gestures should be studied.Some researchers have investigated the recognition of multi-finger prehensile gestures based on Schlesinger's definition [24], in which six prehensile gestures were proposed including cylindrical, hook, tip, palmar (or tripod), spherical and lateral. These gestures are considered capable of providing proper grip ability and satisfying the need in daily living. Liu et al. [25] utilized three surface electrodes to acquire EMG signal of eight prehensile gestures, which included power grasp, hook grasp, wrist flexion, lateral pinch, flattened hand, centralized grip, three-jaw chuck, and the cylindrical grasp, as described in [26]. Features were extracted from a fourth order AR model and EMG histogram, and fed to a cascaded architecture of kernel learning machines including generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and SVM. Though the classification accuracy was above 92.23%, the whole process needed about 500ms and would cause a lag. Matrone et al. [27] used four channel electrodes to collect EMG data from wrist movements and merged these data into two inputs. The inputs were mapped to six outputs based on an inverse principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm [28] to control a multi-DOF underactuated prosthetic hand (CyberHand) [29] to perform three prehensile gestures in real-time: power, precision (or tripod) and lateral grasps. The best accuracy were 95.8%, 87.5%, 100% respectively. As for the amount of electrodes, the fewer is the better. The complexity of signal processing increases with the increasing amount of electrodes. Hence how to realize a multi-DOFs myoelectrical control system with fewer electrodes (i.e., only two electrodes) should be taken into consideration. Engeberg [30] successfully realized the control of the Motion Control Hand (Motion Control Inc., Salt Lake City, USA) in a physiologically expected manner with only two EMG electrodes.Many studies [15,16,21,22,25] trended to use the combination of several different EMG features to classify different movements. Nevertheless, it would bring data redundancy and increase the burden of classification system when too many features were combined. PCA [31] is one algorithm for removing data redundancy, reducing dimensionality and decorrelation, which is usually employed in myoelectric control to process EMG signals [32–34]. Hargrove et al. [34] used individual PCA to preprocess raw EMG signals, and obtained a higher classification accuracy than systems without PCA processing. But PCA is considered lacking of discrimination ability because it is a method based on the amount of variance each component contribute. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is utilized in EMG signals processing, which has capabilities of both dimension reduction and classification. Chu et al. [35] utilized LDA to reduce the dimension of features extracted by WPT, and recognized nine forearm and wrist motions with a accuracy of 97.4%.In this paper, we develop an EMG based prehensile hand gestures recognition system with a supervised LDA algorithm by using only two EMG electrodes. The LDA algorithm is used for features reduction and classification. Firstly, we explore the extent of dimension reduction in the LDA reduction process. And the effectiveness of LDA is verified by comparing with SVM. Secondly, the optimal feature set for the recognition of eight hand gestures is determined. Finally, an average method is proposed to improve the accuracy further. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data collection, the feature extraction and reduction; Section 3 describes the experiments and results; conclusions and future work are provided in Section 4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an off-line myoelectric control system with only two electrodes based on LDA algorithm has been implemented. It is effective in the recognition of eight prehensile hand gestures. The optimal extent of dimension reduction during LDA processing is determined as the largest value allowed to obtain the highest recognition accuracy. By comparing different feature sets, the optimal feature set has been determined as MAV, VAR, and the 4th AR. Under the optimal feature set, the average accuracy in the recognition of eight prehensile hand gestures can achieve 95.94%. To improve the accuracy further, an average method is proposed. After averaging every two projected samples, the average accuracy rises to 98.12% and the best accuracy for some hand gestures even can achieve 100%.In the future work, we will adopt different length window and try to find the optimal length. An overlapping windowing scheme based on the optimal length window will be used, and the window increment will also be investigated. All the work is for reducing the whole processing time further and keeping high recognition accuracy at the same time.
