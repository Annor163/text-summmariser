@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper addresses specification and estimation of multiple-outputs and multiple-inputs production technology in the presence of technical inefficiency. The primary focus is on the primal formulations. Several competing specifications such as production function, input (output) distance function, input requirement function are considered. We show that all these specifications come from the same transformation function and are algebraically identical. We also show that: (i) unless the transformation function is separable (i.e., outputs are separable from inputs), the input (output) ratios in the input (output) distance function can not be treated as exogenous (uncorrelated with technical inefficiency) resulting inconsistent estimates of the input (output) distance function parameters. (ii) Even if input (output) ratios are exogenous, estimation of the input (output) distance function will result in inconsistent parameter estimates if outputs (inputs) are endogenous. We address endogeneity and instrumental variable issues in details in the context of flexible (translog) functional forms. Estimation of several specifications using both single and system approaches are discussed using Norwegian dairy farming data.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Although most of the production processes involve multiple inputs and multiple outputs, estimation of multiple inputs and multiple outputs production function is not popular especially when a single equation approach is used. The problem is that in estimating a production function (using OLS or nonlinear least squares, NLS) one of the output (usually the dependent variable) is considered endogenous1An input (output) is said to be endogenous if it is correlated with the error term in the estimating equation. Since we model inefficiency in production explicitly via a random variable in addition to the usual random noise, an input (output) can be endogenous if it is uncorrelated with the noise component but correlated with the inefficiency component.1and the rest of them (along with the inputs) are treated as exogenous. If all outputs are endogenous, estimation results using the production function suffer from the endogeneity problem since endogeneity of only one output is recognized, i.e., the one used as the dependent variable. Furthermore, results differ depending on which output is chosen as the dependent variable. If the inputs are also endogenous, the endogeneity problem is magnified because in this case all the regressors will be endogenous. To avoid this problem researchers use distance function formulations while estimating multiple-inputs and multiple-output technologies. However, the distance functions cannot avoid the endogeneity problem completely. For example, in estimating the input distance function (IDF) (Shephard (1953, 1970)) the maintained hypothesis (standard assumption) is that outputs are exogenously given. While this might be true for service and demand determined industries such as banks, airlines, railroads, post offices, and public utilities, outputs for majority of manufacturing firms and agricultural farms are unlikely to be exogenously given (except perhaps the case when there are explicit quotas on outputs). Thus, results from the IDF models might also suffer from endogeneity problem, especially if outputs are endogenous. Similarly, in estimating output distance functions (ODFs) the implicit assumption is that inputs are exogenously given (which is rarely the case in practice). Thus the ODF results will be inconsistent if inputs are not exogenous. Since the outputs (inputs) are assumed to be exogenous (endogenous) in IDF (ODF), one needs to check appropriateness of the endogeneity/exogeneity assumptions either from econometric or from economic considerations. The question then is: if outputs (inputs) are endogenous, can one treat the input (output) ratios as exogenous in the IDF (ODF)? If so one needs instruments for the output (input) variables in the IDF (ODF) models. If not, instruments for all input and output variables are required irrespective of whether an IDF or an ODF is used. Although there are papers on input and output distance functions in which instrumental variables are used, it is not clear which regressors are endogenous and in what specifications.2Kumbhakar (2012) is an exception, although this paper assumes that producers are fully efficient and produce a single output.2That is, the readers do not get a clear idea of whether to worry about endogeneity of input ratios or outputs or both while using an IDF.In this paper we address the endogeneity issue from the behavioral assumption that producers maximize profit and both inputs and outputs are decision/choice variables. We focus mostly on the distance function formulations because the endogeneity problem is obvious for the production and input requirement functions (in which inputs and outputs appear as regressors) but is not so obvious for distance functions since some of the regressors appear in ratio form.3Kumbhakar (1996) addressed the endogeneity issue in a multiple production model with technical and allocative inefficiency in terms of a profit function. The main problems in dealing with translog profit function are the following. First, it cannot handle negative profit which is quite common in reality; second, estimation of profit function relies exclusively on input and output prices which are often difficult to get and variations in prices are often very little (which makes the parameter estimates imprecise). Because of these problems we formulate the problem in a primal framework so that information on input and output quantities can be directly used.3Färe and Primont (1995) dealt with the theoretical issues associated with multi-output distance function models in details. However, they did not discuss estimation issues and therefore the endogeneity issue never arose in their discussion. Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) discussed the issues in terms of the dual profit function in which endogeneity problem did not arise because input and output prices are assumed to be exogenous. Kumbhakar (2012) discusses the endogeneity issue in the context of single output production technology with no inefficiency. Here we take a similar approach with multiple output technologies with inefficiency. Our primary concern here is estimation and we examine the endogeneity issue in details using flexible form of the transformation function (instead of a dual profit function) with multiple inputs and multiple outputs from which the IDF and ODF are derived. The idea is to examine when and where one can treat the input and output ratios as exogenous. We consider the translog formulation to show that the endogeneity problem stays unless the IDF (ODF) is rewritten where all the regressors are in ratio form.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we deal with specification of different formulations using the translog functional form. Estimation issues of these models are discussed in Section 3 from a single equation perspective. Section 4 addresses estimation issues using a system approach. The data used in the paper is discussed in Sections 5 and 6 reports empirical results. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main results and conclusions of the paper.Consider a production process in which M outputs are produced using J inputs and the technology is specified as A f(θx,λy)=1, where x is a vector of K inputs and y is a vector of M outputs. The A term captures the impact of observed and unobserved factors that affect the transformation function neutrally.4It can be viewed as TFP growth under unitary returns to scale.4Input technical inefficiency is indicated by θ⩽1 and output technical inefficiency is captured by λ⩾1 (both are scalars). Thus, θx⩽x is the input vector in efficiency (effective) units so that if θ=0.9 inputs are 90% efficient (i.e., use of each input could be reduced by 10% without reducing outputs, if inefficiency is eliminated). Alternatively, θ⩽1 is input-oriented efficiency. Similarly, if λ is 1.05, each output could be increased by 5% without increasing any input, when inefficiency is eliminated. Thus λ−1⩽1can be viewed as output-oriented efficiency. Since both θ and λ are not identified, we consider the following special cases. If θ=1 and λ⩾1 then we have output-oriented technical inefficiency. Similarly, if λ=1 and θ⩽1 then we have input-oriented technical inefficiency. Finally, if λ·θ=1 technical inefficiency is said to be hyperbolic. It says that if the inputs are contracted by a constant proportion, outputs are expanded by the same proportion. That is, instead of moving to the frontier by either expanding outputs (keeping the inputs unchanged) or contracting inputs (holding outputs unchanged), the hyperbolic measure chooses a path to the frontier that leads to a simultaneous increase in outputs and a decrease in inputs by the same rate.There are several other ways of modeling the primal technology. In a directional input distance function (Briec, 1997, Chambers et al., 1998 a path to the frontier can be chosen in a way so that the inputs and outputs decrease (increase) at different rates. In a gauge function (McFadden, 1978; Han, 2012) inputs and outputs increase equi-proportionally to reach the frontier.5Cherchye et al., 2010 discuss use of gauge function in a profit maximizing model. Although the directional distance function talk of choice of directions endogenously, to our knowledge no one has estimated such a system econometrically. Our system approach addresses the endogenous choice using a transformation function. Thus, it can be linked with the directional distance function literature. However, since no behavioral assumption is made in directional distance function models, when it comes to empirical application the choice of direction is arbitrarily decided leaving a big hole between the elegant theory and the inelegant econometric model.5In this paper we specify the technology in terms of the transformation function f(·) because it is much more general than the production/distance/input requirement function. Furthermore, we bring economic behavior into the analysis to address endogeneity of inputs and outputs.We rewrite the transformation function as Af(y∗,x∗)=1, where y∗=yλ, x∗=xθ, and f(y∗,x∗) is assumed to be translog (TL), i.e.,(1)TLtransformationfunction:lnf(y∗,x∗)=∑mαmlnym∗+12∑m∑nαmnlnym∗lnyn∗+∑jβjlnxj∗+12∑j∑kβjklnxj∗lnxk∗+∑m∑jδmjlnym∗lnxj∗,The above function is assumed to satisfy the following symmetry restrictions, viz., βjk=βkjand αmn=αnm. One can use the following normalizations (α1=−1, α1n=0, ∀n, δ1j=0, ∀j, θ=1) to obtain a pseudo production function, viz.,(2)TLProductionfunction:lny1=lnA+∑jβjlnxj+12∑j∑kβjklnxjlnxk+∑m=2αmlnym+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnymlnyn+∑m=2∑jδmjlnymlnxj+uwhereu=lnλ-1+∑m=2αm+∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnyn+∑m=2∑jδmjlnxj+12∑m=2∑n=2αmn(lnλ)2.If we rewrite (1) aslnf(y∗,x∗)=∑m=2αmln(ym/y1)+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnln(ym/y1)ln(yn/y1)+∑jβjlnxj∗+12∑j∑kβjklnxj∗lnxk∗+∑m=2∑jδmjlnxj∗ln(ym/y1)+∑mαmlny1∗+∑m∑nαmnlnymlny1∗+∑j∑mδmjlnxj∗lny1∗and use a different set of normalizations, viz.,∑mαm=-1,∑nαmn=0,∀m,∑mδmj=0,∀j,θ=1, we obtain the output distance function representation,6Note that these identifying/normalizing constraints make the transformation function homogeneous of degree one in outputs. In the efficiency literature one starts from a distance function (which is the transformation function with inefficiency built in) and imposes linear homogeneity (in outputs) constraints to get the ODF. Here we get the same end-result without using the notion of a distance function to start with.6viz.,(3)TLODF:lny1=lnA+∑jβjlnxj+12∑j∑kβjklnxjlnxk+∑m=2αmlnyˆm+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnyˆmlnyˆn+∑j∑m=2δmjlnxjlnyˆm+u,whereu=-lnλ<0,yˆm=ym/y1,m=2,…,M.Furthermore, if we rewrite (1) as(4)lnf(y∗,x∗)=∑mαmlnym∗+12∑m∑nαmnlnym∗lnyn∗+∑j=2βjln(xj/x1)+12∑j=2∑k=2βjkln(xj/x1)ln(xk/x1)+∑m∑j=2δmjln(xj/x1)lnym∗+∑jβjlnx1∗+∑j∑kβjklnxjlnx1∗+∑m∑jδmjlnym∗lnx1∗and use the following normalizations:∑jβj=-1,∑kβjk=0,∀j,∑jδmj=0,∀m,λ=1, we get the input distance function representation,7These normalizing constraints make the transformation function homogeneous of degree one in inputs. In the efficiency literature one defines the IDF as the distance (transformation) function which is homogeneous of degree one in inputs. Here we view the homogeneity property as identifying restrictions on the transformation function without using the notion of a distance function.7viz.,(5)TLIDF:lnx1=lnA+∑j=2βjlnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxˆjlnxˆk+∑mαmlnym+12∑m∑nαmnlnymlnyn+∑m∑j=2δmjlnxˆjlnym+u,whereu=-lnθ>0,xˆj=xj/x1,j=2,…,J.To get to the hyperbolic specification (Färe et al. (2002), Cuesta and Zofio (2005)) in the above IDF we start from (4) and use the normalization lnλ=−lnθ in addition to∑jβj=-1,∑kβjk=0,∀j,∑jδmj=0,∀m. This gives the hyperbolic IDF, viz.,(6)lnx1=lnA+∑mαmlnym+12∑m∑nαmnlnymlnyn+∑j=2βjlnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxˆjlnxˆk+∑m∑j=2δmjlnxˆjlnym+uhwhereuh=lnλ1+∑mαm+∑m∑nαmnlnym+∑jδmjlnxˆj+12∑m∑nαmn{lnλ}2. It is clear from the above that uhis related to lnλ in a highly nonlinear fashion. However, since (5) and (6) are algebraically identical, their inefficiencies are also the same. That is, u=−lnθ in (5) is the same as uhin (6). Thus, the estimated values of input-oriented inefficiency lnθ from (5) can be used to estimate hyperbolic inefficiency lnλ by solving the quadratic equation−lnθ=lnλ1+∑mαm+∑m∑nαmnlnym+∑jδmjlnxˆj+12∑m∑nαmn{lnλ}2.Finally, if we use the following normalizations: β1=−1, β1j=0, ∀j, δm1=0, ∀m, λ=1, the input requirement function is obtained, which can be written as Diewert (1974)(7)TLIRF:lnx1=lnA+∑j=2βjlnxj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxjlnxk+∑mαmlnym+12∑m∑nαmnlnymlnyn+∑m∑j=2δmjlnxjlnym+uwhereu=lnθ-1+∑j=2βj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxj+∑m∑j=2δmjlnym+12∑j=2∑k=2βjk(lnθ)2.It is clear from the above that starting from the translog transformation function specification in (1) one can derive the production function, the output and input distance functions, and the input requirement function simply by using different normalizations. Furthermore, these formulations show how technical inefficiency transmits from one specification into another. As before we warn the readers that the notations α, β and δ are not the same across different specifications. However, starting from any one of them, it is possible to express the parameters in terms of those in the transformation function. Note that other than the input and output distance functions, technical inefficiency appears in a very complicated form. So although all these specifications are algebraically the same, the question that naturally arises is which formulation is easier to estimate, and whether a particular specification has fewer endogenous regressors and is preferred to other specifications.As mentioned before in the efficiency literature the IDF (ODF) is defined with the homogeneity of degree one in inputs (outputs) built in (Shephard (1953)). Consequently, θ (λ−1) is input-oriented (output-oriented) efficiency irrespective of the specification of the technology. Note that here we are introducing inefficiency in the transformation function without the homogeneity assumption built in. As a result our approach might sound confusing to those who are used to the definition of distance function with homogeneity conditions built-in.The main issue in estimating any of the primal functions we introduced in the preceding section is endogeneity of the right hand side variables. Since the right hand side variables differ depending on the specification one uses, we now discuss endogeneity of the regressors in each specification.Before discussing the endogeneity issue, it is worth examining the sources of inefficiency (from now on we will label it as u, which is related to lnλ and/or lnθ). If one argues, following Hoch (1958), Hoch (1962), Mundlak and Hoch (1965), Mundlak (1961) that u reflects ‘management’ and other unobserved variables and assume that producers know them fully, then u would affect input demand and output supply. That is, input and output quantities will be correlated with u. We follow a similar line of argument for inefficiency which is assumed to be known to the producers, and examine possible solutions to this endogeneity problem from economic behavior of the producers.8See also Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), and Wooldridge (2009) on the solution to the endogeneity problem using panel data without using any behavioral assumption. More other non-frontier applications see Griliches and Mairesse (1998) Davis and Garces (2010) and the references cited in there. Orme and Smith (1996) discuss endogeneity problems in estimation of efficiency in DEA models.8At this stage we introduce the stochastic element into the model via A, by specifying it as lnA=α0+v wherev∼i.i.d.0,σv2is production uncertainty (unknown external shock). The idea is to check whether the regressors are correlated with u and v. Consider the production function formulation in (2) first. It has serious endogeneity problem since all the regressors (inputs and outputs) are endogenous (correlated with u and v). The same problem arises in estimating the IRF in (7) because all the regressors are endogenous. An additional problem with both the production and input requirement functions is that the results of these models are not invariant to the choice of the dependent variable. Because of these problems we do not discuss estimation of these models.To show whether we have similar problems in estimating the IDF, ODF, and the hyperbolic IDF, we consider the FOCs of profit maximization,9Kumbhakar et al. (2013) consider maximization of return to the outlay to address endogeneity of inputs and outputs using a multiple-output, multiple-input transformation function. This resulted in a hyperbolic IDF system.9which are:pm+Λfym∗(y∗,x∗)λA=0and-wj+Λfxj∗(y∗,x∗)θA=0wherefym∗(.)andfxj∗(·)are partial derivatives of f(y∗,x∗) with respect toym∗andxj∗respectively, and Λ is the Lagrange multiplier. These FOCs, along with translog transformation function in (1), can be solved implicitly (after using some normalizing restrictions to identify the parameters as well as technical inefficiency) for ymand xjwhich will depend on input and output prices, u and v. That is, all the input and output variables will be correlated with u and v.One can rewrite the above FOCs aswjxj/w1x1=∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lnxj∗÷∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lnx1∗,j=2,…,Jpmym/p1y1=∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lnym∗÷∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lny1∗,m=2,…,Mw1x1/p1y1=-∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lnx1∗÷∂lnf(y∗,x∗)/∂lny1∗and use the translog transformation function in (1) together with various normalizing constraints to check whether the regressors in various specification we considered are exogenous. First, we consider the ODF specification in (3) for which the above FOCs can be written aspmp1yˆm=αm+∑nαmnlnyˆn+∑jδmjlnxjα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxj(8)wjw1xjx1=βj+∑kβjklnxk+∑mδmjlnyˆmβ1+∑kβ1klnxk+∑mδm1lnyˆmw1p1x1y1=-β1+∑kβ1klnxk+∑mδm1lnyˆmα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxjThese FOCs along with the ODF in (3) can be solved (implicitly) to derive the input demand and output supply functions which will depend on u and v and the price variables. Here the idea is to check whether these M−1+J−1+1=M+J−1 equations can be solved for the regressors of ODF in (3), viz.,yˆm,xj,m=2,…,M;j=1,…,Jand whether solutions ofyˆmand xjcan be treated as exogenous. Although we have M+J−1 equations in (8) it is not possible to solve them foryˆmand xj, m=2,…, M;j=1,…, J since the number of endogenous variables is M+J (yˆm,xj,m=2,…,M; xj, j=1,…, J and y1). Furthermore, it is clear from (8) that we cannot solve foryˆmin terms of exogenously given input and output prices. This means that the standard argument that output ratios are exogenous in ODF does not hold and therefore parameter estimates (from both OLS and maximum likelihood methods) will be inconsistent resulting in wrong estimates of inefficiency from using the ML method on the ODF in (3).10See Coelli (2000) for a discussion of some of these issues.10The exceptions are: (i) the inputs are exogenous which means the first (M−1) FOCs in (8) can be solved foryˆmin terms of output price ratios and lnxjand (ii) the technology is homogeneous (constant returns to scale). We come to this point later.Given that neither output ratios nor input quantities can be treated as exogenous, the question is whether one needs to use instruments for all the regressors. If we rewrite the above FOCs in terms of both input and output ratios, viz.,pmp1yˆm=αm+∑nαmnlnyˆn+∑jδmjlnxˆj+∑jδmjlnx1α1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxˆj+∑jδ1jlnx1(9)wjw1xˆj=βj+∑kβjklnxˆk+∑mδmjlnyˆm+∑kβjklnx1β1+∑kβ1klnxˆk+∑mδm1lnyˆm+∑kβ1klnx1then we can solve foryˆm,xˆj,m=2,…,M;j=2,…,Jin terms of price ratios and x1. These solutions are not entirely exogenous because of the presence of one endogenous variable, x1. To check whether this helps in reducing the number of endogenous variables in the ODF in (3), we rewrite it as(10)lny1=α0+∑j=2βjlnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxˆjlnxˆk+∑m=2αmlnyˆm+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnyˆmlnyˆn+∑j=2∑m=2δmjlnxˆjlnyˆm+lnx1∑j=2βj+∑kβjklnxˆj+∑m=2δmjlnyˆm+{lnx1}212∑j∑kβjk+u+vGiven thatyˆmandxˆjcan be solved in terms of exogenous variables (price ratios) and one endogenous variable (lnx1), we need to deal with endogeneity of lnx1 only. That is, if we rewrite the ODF in ratio form (as in (10)) and use instrument for lnx1 the inconsistency problem can be avoided. However, note that the ODF rewritten in ratio form is different from the standard ODF that is used in the literature.If we impose constant returns to scale (CRTS) assumption11Returns to scale in terms of the transformation function is defined as∑j∂lnf(·)/∂lnxj÷∑m∂lnf(·)/∂lnym(Panzar and Willig (1977)).11in (3), it will give these additional restrictions, viz.,∑jδmj=0,∀mand∑kβjk=0,∀j(which implies∑jβjk=0,∀kbecause of symmetry). With these additional restrictions returns to scale is∑jβjand the ODF in (10) can be expressed as(11)lny1(1+r)=α0+rln(x1/y1)+∑j=2βjlnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxˆjlnxˆk+∑m=2αmlnyˆm+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnyˆmlnyˆn+∑j=2∑m=2δmjlnxˆjlnyˆm-u+v⇒lny1=α0∗+β∗ln(x1/y1)+∑j=2βj∗lnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjk∗lnxˆjlnxˆk+∑m=2αm∗lnyˆm+12∑m=2∑n=2αmn∗lnyˆmlnyˆn+∑j=2∑m=2δmj∗lnxˆjlnyˆm-u∗+v∗and the FOCs in (9) becomepmp1yˆm=αm+∑nαmnlnyˆn+∑jδmjlnxˆjα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxˆj(12)wjw1xˆj=βj+∑kβjklnxˆk+∑mδmjlnyˆmβ1+∑kβ1klnxˆk+∑mδm1lnyˆmwherexˆj=xj/x1,r=∑jβjand lnλ=u. Note that the parameters in the second equation in (11) are the old parameters divided by (1+r) and β∗=r/(1+r). It is clear from these FOCs that input and output ratios can be solved in terms of input and output prices (which are exogenous). Thus, with the constant CRTS assumption, the input and output ratios can be treated as exogenous. Furthermore, ln(x1/y1) will be also exogenous because we can add another equation in the above FOCs, viz.,-w1p1x1y1=β1+∑kβ1klnxˆk+∑mδm1lnyˆmα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxˆjto solve for x1/y1. Thus all the regressors in (11) are exogenous. Thus the virtue of CRTS is that all the regressors can be treated as exogenous. Although, (11) is not a standard ODF, one can use the SF technique to estimate the parameters as well as inefficiency.If we further restrict returns to scale and make it unity (unitary RTS), then∑jβj=1which helps us to rewrite (11) as(13)ln(y1/x1)=α0+∑j=2βjlnxˆj+12∑j=2∑k=2βjklnxˆjlnxˆk+∑m=2αmlnyˆm+12∑m=2∑n=2αmnlnyˆmlnyˆn+∑j=2∑m=2δmjlnxˆjlnyˆm-lnλ+vNote that all the regressors are in ratios which are exogenous (as argued from the FOCs in (12)). However, unitary RTS is not consistent with profit maximizing behavior because it violates the second-order conditions of profit maximization.We now check whether separability of the transformation function helps in resolving the problem. Instead of making the CRTS (or unitary RTS) assumption, if we assume that the transformation function is separable, this means δmj=0, ∀m, j. This enables us to solve foryˆmfrom the first (M−1) equations in (8) in terms of output prices. Thus, output ratios will be exogenous. However, the input ratios will be endogenous because their solutions from the last (J−1) equations in (8) will depend on x1 which is endogenous. Thus to estimate the ODF one needs to take care of endogeneity of all the inputs (i.e., instruments for all the input variables are required), even when separability is assumed.We can use the exact same arguments to show that the regressors in the IDF in (5) are endogenous unless (i) outputs are exogenous and (ii) the technology is homogeneous (CRTS) which implies these additional constraints, viz.,∑mδmj=0,∀jand∑kβjk=0,∀j. Under CRTS the IDF in (5) can be written in such a way that the outputs are in ratio form except one (i.e., y1). That is, the resulting IDF will have one endogenous variable as regressor (lny1). This is similar to the ODF result in (11) where lnx1 is the only endogenous regressor. Instead of CRTS assumption, if we assume the transformation function to be separable, then all the output variables in the IDF model will be endogenous. This is the same as the ODF model result.In summary we conclude that if RTS is non-constant, all the regressors will be correlated with the composed error term, u+v. This is true for IDF, ODF, production and input requirement functions. Even if the technology is separable, input (output) ratios in the IDF (ODF) are exogenous but outputs (inputs) are endogenous. Thus the common feature in all these (non-CRTS) models is that some of the regressors are endogenous and therefore a single-step SF technique cannot be used. One has to use a two-step approach in which the first step is to ignore inefficiency and estimate the model using IV for the endogenous variables. The residuals of the estimating equation (IDF or ODF) can then be used in the second stage to estimate inefficiency using the SF technique. The advantage of this two-step approach is that it is easy to estimate and the estimated parameters in the first-stage do not depend on distributional assumptions. The downside is that the estimators are not efficient.Since the inefficiency term appears linearly in the IDF and ODF specifications we consider only the distance function specifications. First, we start from the ODF specification in (3). The corresponding FOCs with optimization error (allocative inefficiency) can be written aspmp1yˆmexp(εm)=αm+∑nαmnlnyˆn+∑jδmjlnxjα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxjwjw1xjx1exp(vj)=βj+∑kβjklnxk+∑mδmjlnyˆmβ1+∑kβ1klnxk+∑mδm1lnyˆm(14)w1p1x1y1exp(v1)=-β1+∑kβ1klnxk+∑mδm1lnyˆmα1+∑nα1nlnyˆn+∑jδ1jlnxjwhere εm, m=2,…, M and vj, j=1,…, J are optimization errors. The ODF in (3) along with the above FOCs (after taking log) define a system of M+J equations with M+J endogenous variables (xj, j=1,…, J, y1 andyˆm,m=2,…,M). The log-likelihood function for the present system (after taking log of the FOCs) can be derived based on the distributional assumptions on u and η (η′=(v,εm,vj), j=1,…, J;m=2,…, M). Maximization of the log-likelihood function will give consistent estimators of the parameters which can then be used to obtain firm-specific estimate of output-oriented technical inefficiency from E(u∣(bu+η)) when b′=(1, 0,…, 0). Since the ML method is quite complicated, one can use the simpler alternative, viz., a two-step procedure. In the first step, technical inefficiency is ignored and the system is estimated using iterative 3SLS or a system GMM in which log of price ratios, their squares and cross-products can be used as instruments. Once the parameters are estimated, residuals from the ODF can be used in the second step to estimate the intercept and technical inefficiency using MLE. Note that if inefficiency distribution has constant mean and variance (which is true for half-normal, truncated normal, exponential, gamma distributions) only the intercept term will be biased if inefficiency is ignored. The intercept is estimated in the second step along with inefficiency. As noted above this two-step procedure is easy to use and the parameters of the ODF are invariant to the distributional assumptions on the error components. Distributional assumptions are only used to estimate inefficiency in the second step.If one stars from the IDF in (5) the corresponding FOCs can be written aspmp1ymy1exp(εm)=αm+∑nαmnlnyn+∑jδmjlnxˆjα1+∑nα1nlnyn+∑jδ1jlnxˆjwjw1xˆjexp(vj)=βj+∑kβjklnxˆk+∑mδmjlnymβ1+∑kβ1klnxˆk+∑mδm1lnym(15)w1p1x1y1exp(v1)=-β1+∑kβ1klnxˆk+∑mδm1lnymα1+∑nα1nlnyn+∑jδ1jlnxˆjwhere εm, m=2,…, M and vj, j=1,…, J are optimization errors. The IDF in (5) along with the above FOCs (after taking log) define the system12See Karagiannis et al. (2006) and Coelli et al. (2008) for a system using translog input distance function based on cost minimization behavior.12with M+J endogenous variables (xˆj,j=2,…,J,x1and ym, m=1,…, M) which can be estimated using MLE. This requires distributional assumptions on the error components.Thus the difference between the two systems is that in the former output-oriented technical inefficiency is directly estimated while in the latter input-oriented technical inefficiency is estimated. However, it is not necessary to estimate both. It is possible to estimate input-oriented technical inefficiency (lnθ) from the ODF and vice versa. This requires solving a quadratic equation, viz.,−lnλ+lnθ∑jβj+∑kβjklnxk+∑mδmjlnym+12∑j∑kβjk(lnθ)2=0for lnθ using estimated values of the parameters, lnλ and data. If the interest is in estimating input-oriented inefficiency, it is better to use the IDF system which takes care of endogeneity of outputs.The data source for application of some of the models discussed here is the Norwegian Farm Accountancy Survey. This is farm-level data collected by the Norwegian Agricultural Economics Research Institute. The data is a large unbalanced panel with 4678 observations on 714 dairy farms observed during 1992–2006. It includes farm production and economic data collected annually from about 1000 farms from different regions, farm size classes, and types of farms. Participation in the survey is voluntary. There is no limit on the number of years a farm may be included in the survey. Approximately 10% of the farms surveyed are replaced every year. The farms are classified according to their main category of farming, defined in terms of the standard gross margins of the farm. Thus the main share of the total standard gross margin for farms categorized as dairy farms comes from dairy production.Dairy farms are usually involved in other farm production activities such as production of various types of meat, crop, etc. We consider two outputs: milk measured in liters of milk sold (Y1), and a single measure of all other outputs (Y2) which include beef and cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and crop products. Since it includes several outputs we measure it in value terms, i.e., revenue from all these outputs. The nominal values are then converted to 2006 values by deflating them using appropriate price indexes. We use the following inputs: land measured in decares (daa=0.1hectare) (X1), own and hired farm labor in hours (X2), purchased feed (X3), materials (X4) (which include cost of fertilizer, pesticides, preservatives, cost related to animal husbandry, etc.). Purchased feed and materials are measured in 2006 values. Both are converted to 2006 values by deflating them using their price indices. The price information is taken from the farm survey when available, and when not, from the agricultural sector of the national accounts.13Details about the data can be found in Kumbhakar et al. (2008).13
