Oval substrates are widely used in automobiles to reduce the exhaust emissions in Diesel oxidation Catalyst of CI engine. Because of constraints in space and packaging Oval substrate is preferred rather than round substrate. Obtaining the flow uniformity is very challenging in oval substrate comparing with round substrate. In this present work attempts are made to optimize the inlet cone design to achieve the optimal flow uniformity with the help of CATIA V5 which is 3D design tool and CFX which is 3D CFD tool. Initially length of inlet cone and mass flow rate of exhaust stream are analysed to understand the effects of flow uniformity and pressure drop. Then short straight cones and angled cones are designed. Angled cones have been designed by two methodologies. First methodology is rotating flow inlet plane along the substrate in shorter or longer axis. Second method is shifting the flow inlet plane along the longer axis. Large improvement in flow uniformity is observed when the flow inlet plane is shifted along the direction of longer axis by 10, 20 and 30mm away from geometrical centre. When the inlet plane is rotated again based on 30mm shifted geometry, significant improvement at rotation angle of 20° is observed. The flow uniformity is optimum when second shift is performed based on second rotation. This present work shows that for an oval substrate flow, uniformity index can be optimized when inlet cone is angled by rotation of flow inlet plane along axis of substrate.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Catalytic converters are more efficient in converting harmful gas of automotive vehicles into harmless gas which is a more important device in reducing emissions. It is important for automotive researchers to optimize the catalytic convertor to meet the stringent emission norms laid by governments from time to time. Particularly, flow uniformity, pressure drop and light-off performance are the most important factors that are to be considered [1–7].Zygourakis [8] was one of the first who analysed flow distribution in a single 2D converter by using finite element analysis which explained flow mal-distribution and CO light-off. Lai et al. [9] used PHOENICS software for 3D analysis of dual brick catalytic converter. They compared CFD results with experimental results obtained by LDA. Kwangsup Hwang et al. [10] investigated dynamic flow distribution inside CATCON by using laser Doppler velocimetry and high speed flow visualization. Jahn et al. [11] included temperature in 3D modelling of monolith and validated against experimental results. Martin et al. [12] reported flow mal-distribution affect the light-off characteristics by simplified zonal analysis. Jeong and Kim [13] reported the importance of warm up catalyst in light-off performance of a three way catalytic convertor. In latter part of the 1990s, CFD used to study cold flow 2D simulations [14,15]. Taylor [16] investigated on high temperature performance of single converter geometry by using 2D simulation. Michael Breuer et al. [17] optimized flow uniformity in catalyst by using experimental methods. Shi-jin et al. [18] used 2D CFD for varying cone angle with flow distribution device and validated against the experimental results although the agreement was not perfect. Recently Shi-Jin Shuai et al. [19] and Badami et al. [20] used experimental test and numerical simulation to optimize the system. CFD analysis has been evaluated by experimental tests.Performance of honey comb structure is always directly proportional to the flow uniformity. Uniform flow increases life of CATCON and better performance of DOC. Julia Windmann et al. [21] reported the effect of flow uniformity on engine light off behaviour. Chakravarthy et al. [22] modelled single converter geometry by using algebraic turbulence model in 2D with temperature and reaction and validated the results using the experiments of Holmgren et al. [23], They used representative channel approach with Voltz [24] model for CO and C3H6 oxidation without inclusion of wash coat diffusion. Windmann et al. [25] and Campbell et al. [26] proved the effect of flow distribution on the light-off of a three way converter.During 2000s, lot of papers were published with reactions using global kinetics without including wash coat diffusion. Realistic reaction chemistry [27–29] inclusion is a major challenge facing the convertor modelling. Tsinoglou et al. [30] included energy and mass balance equations with cold flow simulation and investigated transient flow distributions in the catalytic converter. Flow uniformity inside the CATCON substrate is not only dependent on exhaust manifold [31], inlet and outlet cone design but also substrate dimensions and configuration. There is no constant optimized cone design for different catalytic converters, but optimization of inlet cone gives more flow uniformity. Nowadays CFD is capable are predicting the results more accurately in complicated flow and evolved as the primary tool [32] for flow optimization. Guojiang and Song [33] used CFX software and modelled single converter. They studied flow distribution and its importance in light-off performance. Shuai and Wang [34] used Voltz model kinetics and simulated temperature field. Lun et al. [35] used AVL CFD software and performed CFD analysis with Voltz [24] kinetics on substrate of constant cell density with varying wall thickness and compared results with the experimental velocity profile of Holmgren et al. [23].In this present work computer numerical simulations have been done for an oval substrate with different inlet cone designs. Analyses are reported in the following areas:•effect of inlet mass flow rate on flow uniformity indexeffect of inlet cone length on flow uniformity indexeffect of cone angle (along shorter axis) on flow uniformity indexeffect of cone angle (along longer axis) on flow uniformity indexDesign variants are developed by the following methods:•by rotation or shifting along the shorter axisby rotation and shifting along the longer axisFinally the CFD results are compared and inlet cone design for optimal flow uniformity is proposed for this particular CATCON system.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
CFD simulations have been performed systematically for the purpose of optimizing inlet cone design in terms of flow uniformity and pressure drop for an under body oval substrate. CFD results executed at steady-state to show the dependence of flow distribution on inlet mass flow rate. Higher mass flow rate leads to lower flow uniformity index. Study on inlet cone length shows a significant enhancement exists only when the length of the inlet cone is increased from 80mm to 85mm. Starting from baseline geometry, a short and straight cone, a process involving a few sets of rotations and shifting of flow inlet plane is performed in order to design various angled inlet cones. Flow uniformity index of the baseline geometry is below 0.93 (<93%) and average velocity deviation is over 24% even when the effects of outlet cone and manifold runners are not considered. The CFD results for angled inlet cone optimization by rotation and shifting of the flow inlet plane can be summarized as follows:•CFD results for angled cones created by initial rotations of the flow inlet plane along the shorter axis shows that there is no significant enhancement (<1.5%) with angled cones constructed by rotation along the shorter axis of the substrate. Also there is no significant improvement in pressure drop for cone angles of less than 35°.CFD results for angled cones created by initial rotations of the flow inlet plane along the longer axis shows no distinct improvement in flow uniformity index. A more than 2.0% enhancement is found when the flow inlet plane in the last angled cone is shifted 10mm along the longer axis. A significant enhancement of flow uniformity index (>5%) is observed when the inlet cone is rotated again based on the last shifted geometry with a new reference point. Flow uniformity index is further improved by performing another shift along the longer axis. Finally, flow uniformity index is able to be improved up to 0.975.It is important to notice that pressure drop in the inlet cone is able to be reduced from 2450Pa to 2375Pa.CFD simulation results proves that, under body oval substrate can be optimized by involving rotation and shifting of the flow inlet plane which to be adopted to achieve desired flow distribution inside the substrate.Pressure drop obtained by CFD results for base line straight cone under body oval substrate catalytic convertor compared with engine test bed pressure drop experimental data. The percentage of error is 6%.
