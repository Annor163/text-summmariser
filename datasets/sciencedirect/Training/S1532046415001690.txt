Adapting existing natural language processing resources for cardiovascular risk factors identification in clinical notes

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We used natural language processing (NLP) to extract heart disease risk factors.Components were adapted from two existing NLP applications.We used existing tools without feature engineering or re-training of models.Our system achieved an overall micro-averaged F1-measure of 87.47%.Adapting existing tools allowed for performance comparable to sophisticated systems.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The 2014 i2b2 natural language processing shared task focused on identifying cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity and smoking status among other factors found in health records of diabetic patients. In addition, the task involved detecting medications, and time information associated with the extracted data. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a natural language processing (NLP) application conceived for this i2b2 shared task. For increased efficiency, the application main components were adapted from two existing NLP tools implemented in the Apache UIMA framework: Textractor (for dictionary-based lookup) and cTAKES (for preprocessing and smoking status detection). The application achieved a final (micro-averaged) F1-measure of 87.5% on the final evaluation test set. Our attempt was mostly based on existing tools adapted with minimal changes and allowed for satisfying performance with limited development efforts.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The 2014 i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) challenge proposed several different tasks: clinical text de-identification, cardiovascular risk factors identification, software usability assessment, and novel data uses. Our efforts focused on the second track, identifying risk factors for heart disease based on the automated analysis of narrative clinical records of diabetic patients [1]. The annotation guidelines for the task defined eight categories of information associated with increased risk for heart disease: (1) Diabetes, (2) Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), (3) Hyperlipidemia, (4) Hypertension, (5) Obesity, (6) Family history of CAD, (7) Smoking and (8) Medications associated with the aforementioned chronic diseases. Each category of information (except family history of CAD and smoking status) had to be described with indicator and time attributes. The indicator attribute captures indications of the risk factor in the clinical text. For instance, Diabetes could be identified using a mention of the disease (i.e. “patient has h/o DMII”), or a hemoglobin A1c value above 6.5mg/dL (i.e. “7/18: A1c: 7.3”) while CAD could be identified using a mention (i.e. “PMH: significant for CAD”), or an event (i.e. “CABG in 1999”). The time attribute specifies the temporal relation to the Document Creation Time (DCT). It could take any one of the following values: before DCT, during DCT or after DCT. We refer the reader to [2] for a complete description of the annotation guidelines. For this challenge, we built a natural language processing (NLP) application based on the Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) [3] and reusing existing tools previously developed to address similar tasks in previous i2b2 challenges. In this paper, we present our approach to extract relevant information from clinical notes, discuss performance results, and conclude with remarks about our experience adapting existing NLP tools.
