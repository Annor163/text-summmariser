@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Permutation flow shop scheduling (PFSP) is among the most studied scheduling settings. In this paper, a hybrid Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization algorithm (HTLBO), which combines a novel teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm for solution evolution and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) for fast solution improvement, is proposed for PFSP to determine the job sequence with minimization of makespan criterion and minimization of maximum lateness criterion, respectively. To convert the individual to the job permutation, a largest order value (LOV) rule is utilized. Furthermore, a simulated annealing (SA) is adopted as the local search method of VNS after the shaking procedure. Experimental comparisons over public PFSP test instances with other competitive algorithms show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For the DMU problems, 19 new upper bounds are obtained for the instances with makespan criterion and 88 new upper bounds are obtained for the instances with maximum lateness criterion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In permutation flow shop scheduling problems, n jobs N=N1, N2,…,Nnhave to be processed on a set of m machines M=M1, M2,…,Mmsequentially. Therefore, each job consists of a set of m operations Oj={Oj1,…,Ojm}. Each operation has a given processing time denoted by Pi,j(i=1, 2,…,m, j=1, 2,…,n). At any time, each machine can process at most one job and each job can be processed by at most one machine. Once the processing of a job on a machine has started, it must be completed without interruption. The sequence in which the jobs to be processed are identical for each machine. Thus there is n! possible processing sequences for the problem. The minimum completion time, which is known as makespan or Cmax, is the most commonly studied objective of PFSP [1]. Recently, PFSP with other objectives such as those involving due dates have drawn significant attention [2–4]. Demirkol et al. [5] presented extensive sets of randomly generated test problems for the problems of minimizing makespan (Cmax) and maximum lateness (Lmax) in flow shops, generally referred to DMU problems. PFSP with the makespan criterion can be denoted as Fm|prmu|Cmaxand has been proved NP-complete [6]. PFSP with the criterion of maximum lateness can be denoted as Fm|prmu|Lmax, where Lj=max{Cj−dj, 0} is the lateness of job j, being djits due date and Cjits completion time at the last machine of the shop. Lenstra et al. [7] proved that the two-machine flow shop with maximum lateness is NP-complete.Approaches for PFSP can be divided into three categories: exact algorithms, heuristics and meta-heuristics. Exact algorithms, such as branch-and-bound method, dynamic programming and mathematical programming, have been successfully applied in solving small instances [8–10]. However, they could not obtain promising results in a reasonable time for medium or large instances. As for the heuristics, a feasible solution is generally built based on some constructive operations with a fast process, while the solution is quite not satisfactory [11]. More recently, the meta-heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), have been given special emphasis for they could provide high-quality solutions with reasonable computing times. In recent decade, an increasing number of research papers focusing on meta-heuristics for PFSP have been published.Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) proposed by Rao et al. [12] is a novel efficient optimization method. The main idea behind TLBO is the simulation of a classical school learning process. The advantages of TLBO algorithm such as ease of implementation, immediately accessible for practical applications, speed to get the solutions and robustness are shown in the literature [12,13]. TLBO seems to be a rising star from amongst a number of meta-heuristics with relatively competitive performances. Empirical tests show that TLBO could outperforms the other well-known meta-heuristics regarding constrained benchmark functions, constrained mechanical design, and continuous non-linear numerical optimization problems [13]. However, applications of TLBO for discrete combinatorial optimization problems are still limited.In this paper, a novel hybrid Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization algorithm (HTLBO) is proposed for PFSP to optimize two objectives: the makespan and maximum lateness of jobs. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review about PFSP problem; Section 3 provides the description of the PFSP; Section 4 describes implementation details of the HTLBO for PFSP; Section 5 shows the computational results and comparisons with other competitive algorithms; and Section 6 concludes the paper.
