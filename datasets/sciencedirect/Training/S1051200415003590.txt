@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Secret image sharing is a method to decompose a secret image into shadow images (shadows) so that only qualified subset of shadows can be used to reconstruct the secret image. Usually all shadows have the same importance. Recently, an essential SIS (ESIS) scheme with different importance of shadows was proposed. All shadows are divided into two group: essential shadows and non-essential shadows. In reconstruction, the involved shadows should contain at least a required number of shadows, including at least a required number of essential shadows. However, there are two problems in previous ESIS scheme: unequal size of shadows and concatenation of sub-shadow images. These two problems may lead to security vulnerability and complicate the reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel ESIS scheme based on derivative polynomial and Birkhoff interpolation. A single shadow with the same-size is generated for each essential and non-essential participant. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can avoid above two problems effectively.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Secret image sharing (SIS) is a technique for image protection using mechanism of secret sharing [1–3]. It encrypts a secret image into multiple shadows and then distributes them to the corresponding participants. In the revealing process, only qualified subsets of participants can cooperate to reveal the secret image with their shadows. Usually, SIS scheme is implemented as a threshold(k,n)-SIS scheme, wherek≤n, that divides a secret image into n shadows. Any k shadows can be used for reconstructing the secret image, while any(k−1)or fewer shadows cannot obtain any secret information. Image steganography can also protect secret information from unauthorized parties. However, the secret information cannot be recovered when the stego-image is modified or lost. SIS can avoid this problem when the shadows are transmitted by different channels [4,5]. In 1979, Shamir [1] proposed a novel(k,n)secret sharing scheme to hide a secret data in the constant term of a(k−1)-degree polynomial. Thien and Lin [2] extended Shamir's work and first proposed a(k,n)-SIS scheme by embedding secret pixels into all coefficients of a(k−1)-degree polynomial. The shadow size of Thien and Lin's(k,n)-SIS scheme is1/ktimes of the secret image. In [3], the shadow size was further reduced by using Huffman code.SIS schemes have been exploited in many applications as a means to protect secret image, and various SIS schemes with specific functions are introduced subsequently. For example, shadows in [2,3] are noise-like and suspected to censorships. Various(k,n)-SIS schemes were proposed by using steganography and shadows reveal meaningful images [6–10]. By adding the detection of the modification of shadows, this scheme is called as a steganographic and authenticated image sharing (SAIS) scheme. SIS schemes and SAIS schemes have the threshold property that recovers either the entire image or nothing. Researchers introduced scalable SIS (SSIS) schemes [11–15], which provide progressive decoding. In SSIS scheme, the information amount of reconstructed image is proportional to the number of shadows involved in reconstruction. Additionally, another kind of SIS scheme with two decoding options was proposed [16–19]. This two-in-one SIS (TiOSIS) scheme combines SIS scheme and visual cryptographic scheme (VCS) [20]. In TiOSIS scheme, a vague secret image can be revealed by stacking shadows, while the original grayscale secret image can be decoded by computation.All above schemes consider each participant has the same importance in reconstruction. However, there are many examples that some participants are accorded special privileges due to their status or importance, e.g., heads of government, managers of company, …, and etc. In fact, weighted SIS (WSIS) scheme [21–23] and essential SIS (ESIS) scheme [24–26] have different importance of shadows. WSIS scheme generates shadows with different weights according to priority of the participant. The secret image is recovered if and only if the value of total weights for the involved shadows achieves the threshold. Thus, WSIS scheme does not have the essentiality as in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme. A(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme has s essential shadows and(n−s)non-essential shadows. The so-called essentiality of(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme is that we need k shadows including at least t essential shadows for reconstruction.In [27], Tassa proposed a hierarchical secret sharing by using derivative polynomial function and Birkhoff interpolation. Afterwards, Guo et al. [28] adopted Tassa's hierarchical secret sharing to propose a hierarchical SIS scheme. However, Guo et al.'s [28] SIS scheme embedded secret pixels into all coefficients of a polynomial. This compromises the secrecy that some non-authorized subsets of participants can recover parts of the secret image. Recently, Pakniat et al. [29] enhances Guo et al.'s scheme to propose a secure hierarchical SIS scheme. Although Pakniat et al.'s scheme also embeds secret pixels into all coefficients in polynomials, these coefficients are securely encrypted by using cellular automata and hash function. From the viewpoint of secret sharing, both Guo et al. and Pakniat et al.'s scheme use all coefficients of polynomial to embed secret pixels. Therefore, their schemes are not secure as the original Tassa's scheme.Both WSIS scheme and ESIS scheme have the different importance of shadows, but only ESIS scheme has the essentiality. However, there are two problems in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme: unequal size of shadows and concatenation of sub-shadows, which are ignored by the previous(t,s,k,n)-ESIS schemes [24,25]. If the sizes of essential shadows and non-essential shadows are different, attackers may detect the status of these shadows from their sizes. In this case, the size of shadows may leak some sensitive information. For the problem of concatenation of sub-shadows, we need not only to record the location of each sub-shadow, but also extra operation to extract each sub-shadow before revealing. In the practical use, the two problems may bring about security vulnerability and make the reconstruction more difficult. In this paper, we propose a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme to solve the two problems based on derivative polynomial and Birkhoff interpolation. In our scheme, the secret pixels are embedded into partial coefficients of a polynomial. The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the first(k,n)-SIS scheme, Thien and Lin's [2](k,n)-SIS scheme, and two previous(t,s,k,n)-ESIS schemes [24,25]. Two critical problems in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme are introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we propose the improved(t,s,k,n)-ESIS with the same size of shadows. Experiment, comparison, and discussion are given in Section 5. Finally, the conclusion is provided in Section 6.In 1979, Shamir [1] introduced a(k,n)secret sharing scheme to share a secret into n shares by using a(k−1)-degree polynomialf(x)=(a0+a1x+⋯+ak−1xk−1)modp, in which p is a prime number anda0is the secret data. The dealer randomly selects this polynomial, and generates n shares(i,f(i)),i=1,2,…,n. Any k shares (say1,2,…, and k) can be used to recoverf(x)by Lagrange's interpolationf(x)=∑i=1kf(i)∏j=1,j≠ik(x−j)(i−j)modp. Then, the secret is derived froma0=f(0). However, anyk−1or fewer shares cannot recover the polynomialf(x)and thus do not obtain any secret information.Following Shamir's work, Thien and Lin embedded secret pixels into all k coefficients in a(k−1)-degree polynomial to generate n random grayscale values of n noise-like shadows. The sharing process is briefly described as follows. A secret image is first divided into non-overlapping blocks, and every block has k pixels. Every block is then represented as a(k−1)-degree polynomialf(x). With each participant ID id, the shadow pixel is generated byf(id). Since it embeds k pixels at each time, the shadow size is1/kof the secret image. When sharing a grayscale secret image, the prime number p is often chosen as 251 (the largest prime number smaller than 255) so that the coefficients are between 0 and 250 and suitable to represent 8-bit grayscale. However, the grayscales (>250) have to be modified to 250 and has distortion in this case. Obviously, we can use Galois FieldGF(28)instead of modulus 251 to achieve a distortion-less scheme. In previous literatures, some schemes simply adoptGF(251)while some schemes useGF(28)to obtain a distortion-less image.In a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme, s out of n shadows are essential. A(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme has not only the threshold property (i.e., k or more shadows should be involved in reconstruction) but also the essentiality property (i.e., there are at least t essential shadows in the k involved shadows). For example, k shadows including(t−1)essential shadows and(k−t+1)non-essential shadows cannot be used for reconstructing the secret. The essentiality property is not achieved in this case. Another example of k shadows including t essential shadows and(k−t)non-essential shadows satisfies the conditions of the threshold and the essentiality simultaneously, and it can reconstruct the secret. The conditiont=kimplies that we do not need non-essential shadows for reconstruction, and thus non-essential shadows do not have any contribution for reconstructing the secret. Regardings=n, all shadows are essential and the(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme is reduced to a(k,n)-SIS scheme. Fork=n, a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme is also reduced to a(n,n)-SIS scheme. Therefore, for a non-trivial ESIS scheme, it is obvious that these values should satisfyt≤s<nandt<k<n.All shadows of the conventional(k,n)-SIS scheme have the same importance. In various applications of group hierarchical decision making, some participants are more important than others. For example, a group consisting of 2 monitors and 6 soldiers carries out missile launching, which is controlled by a launch password. This password is encoded into 8 noise-like shadows and distributed to 2 monitors and 6 soldiers. Because the launch of a missile is a key issue, the decision of launch requires the affirmative votes of 4 members (i.e., the threshold isk=4) including one monitor's agreement (i.e.,t=1). There are total 8 members (n=8) including 2 essential members (s=2). Therefore, this scenario has the threshold property and the essentiality as(1,2,4,8)-ESIS scheme.The threshold of reconstructing a secret image in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme is k, which is the same as that of the conventional(k,n)-SIS scheme. Let P be the set of all participants and Q be the set of participants involved in reconstruction,Q⊆P. And, let EP and NEP be the sets of essential participants and non-essential participants, respectively, whereP=EP∪NEP. Participants in EP and NEP have the different importance of shadows, and the cardinalities of EP and NEP are|EP|=sand|NEP|=(n−s). Let (Q\NEP) denote the set having elements in Q but not in NEP. A qualified subset of participants in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme, should satisfy the threshold condition:|Q|≥k. Meanwhile, the set (Q\NEP), has at least t essential participants (i.e., satisfy the essentiality condition). Both conditions allow any k participants (including at least t essential participants) can reconstruct the secret. The threshold condition and the essentiality condition of(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme are formally defined as follows.(1){(i)Threshold condition:|Q|≥k,(ii)Essentiality condition:|Q\NEP|≥t.In this section, we briefly review Li et al.'s ESIS scheme [24] and Yang al.'s ESIS scheme [25]. In the first(k,n)-SIS scheme (Thien and Lin's(k,n)-SIS scheme), if we do not permute the secret image, shadows will not be completely noise-like. Some visible edges are revealed, and some information of the secret image is revealed on shadows. Therefore, the secret image I should be permuted to imageIˆbefore sharing. In reconstruction phase, we can use the inverse process of permutation to obtain I fromIˆ. In this paper, we describe all ESIS schemes sharing the permuted imageIˆ. The importance of essential shadows in ESIS scheme is not demonstrated on their shadow size. Therefore, the size of essential shadow with higher importance is not necessarily larger than that of non-essential shadow. For example, Li et al.'s ESIS scheme [24] has the smaller essential shadow size than non-essential shadow size. On the contrary, Yang et al.'s ESIS schemes [25,26] have the larger essential shadow size than non-essential shadow size. However, Yang and Wu's scheme [26] has a serious security problem. In the reconstruction process, any t essential shadows (not k shadows) may decode the secret image when2t>k.Li et al.'s [24](t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme adopts the conventional(k,s+k−t)-SIS scheme and the(1,k−t,n−s)-SSIS scheme [13]. A(1,k−t,n−s)-SSIS scheme gradually reveals the partial secret from any one or more shadows, and the whole secret can be recovered from n shadows. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the permuted imageIˆis first encrypted by(k,s+k−t)-SIS scheme to generate(s+k−t)sub-shadowsIˆ1,…,Iˆs+k−t(denoted as small yellow-green square). Then, we use s sub-shadowsIˆ1−Iˆsas s essential shadowsO1−Os(denoted as yellow square). The remaining (k−t) sub-shadowsIˆs−Iˆs+k−tare used as the inputs of(1,k−t,n−s)-SSIS scheme to generate(n−s)non-essential shadowsOs+1−On(denoted as green square). Fig. 1(b) illustrates Yang et al.'s [25](t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme, we use two SIS schemes in a two-layer hierarchical structure. In the 1-st layer, the permuted imageIˆis used as the input of(k,s+k−t)-SIS scheme. Next,(k−t)sub-shadowsIˆs+1−Iˆs+k−tin the 1-st layer are encrypted by(k,n)-SIS scheme, respectively. By collecting every(n−s)sub-shadows for eachIˆj,(s+1)≤j≤(s+k−t), we generate (n−s) non-essential shadowsOs+1−On(denoted as green square). Other s sub-shadows for eachIˆj,(s+1)≤j≤(s+k−t), are together used with the s sub-shadowsIˆ1−Iˆsin the 1-st layer to create s essential shadowsO1−Os(denoted as yellow square).There are two problems in(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme [24,25]: a) the unequal size of shadows, and b) the concatenation of sub-shadows. These two problems are ignored by Li et al.'s scheme and Yang et al.'s scheme [24,25]. However, in practice, problem a) may bring about the security vulnerability and problem b) complicates the reconstruction process.A(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme has s essential shadows (sayO1,O2,…, andOs) with the size SE and(n−s)non-essential shadows (sayOs+1,Os+2,…,On) with the size SN. Essential shadows and non-essential shadows of previous(t,s,k,n)-ESIS schemes [24,25] have different sizes. Suppose the original secret image I has the size|I|. The sizes of SE and SN for Li et al.'s [24](t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme areSEL=|I|/kandSNL=Hk−t×|I|/k, whereHk−t=1+1/2+⋯+1/(k−t)is the harmonic number. Yang et al.'s [25] ESIS scheme hasSEY=(2k−t)×|I|/k2andSNY=(k−t)×|I|/k2. For these two(t,s,k,n)-ESIS schemes, we haveSEL<SNLandSEY>SNY. As shown in Fig. 1(a), Li et al.'s [24] ESIS scheme directly uses the output sub-shadows of(k,s+k−t)-SIS schemeIˆ1,Iˆ2,…, andIˆsas essential shadowsO1,O2,…, andOs. However, Yang et al.'s [25] ESIS scheme adds extra output sub-shadows of(k,n)-SIS scheme (see Fig. 1(b)) intoIˆ1,Iˆ2,…, andIˆsto create essential shadowsO1,O2,…, andOs. Compared with Li et al.'s [24] scheme, Yang et al.'s [25] scheme has larger ES, smaller size of total shadows and smaller size of the required shadow images in reconstruction.SinceSEL≠SNLandSEY≠SNY, the outsiders (attackers) can perceive the differences of shadow size. This problem of unequal-size of shadows has security vulnerability. From the shadow size, attackers learn who essential participants are. Afterwards, attackers may advisedly attack the essential participants and prohibit them from involving in reconstruction. Becauset<k, it is easier to compromise the threshold property of a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme by attacking essential participant. Additionally, essential participants are often heads of government, leaders of company. Therefore, another flaw is that the status of a participant is exposed to public and it poses a threat to the privacy of personal information. From the above description, it is necessary to design a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme that has the same size of essential and non-essential shadows.The(1,k−t,n−s)-SSIS scheme in Li et al.'s [24] ESIS scheme is constructed from(k−t)SIS schemes [13]. By using(k−t)imagesIˆs+1,Iˆs+2,…, andIˆs+k−tas the inputs of(1,n−s)-SIS scheme,(2,n−s)-SIS scheme, …, and(k−t,n−s)-SIS scheme, respectively, their output sub-shadows areSs+1,i,Ss+2,i,…, andSs+k−t,i,1≤i≤(n−s). Then, Li et al.'s [24](t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme has non-essential shadowsOs+i=(Ss+1,i||Ss+2,i|⋯||Ss+k−t,i), where1≤i≤(n−s)and ‘||’ denotes concatenation operation. In Yang et al.'s [25](t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme, suppose that(k−t)(k,n)-SIS schemes with the input imagesIˆs+1,Iˆs+2,…, andIˆs+k−t, respectively, have output sub-shadowsSs+1,i,Ss+2,i,…, andSs+k−t,i,1≤i≤n. Then, Yang et al.'s [25] ESIS scheme has essential shadowsOi=(Iˆi||Ss+1,i||Ss+2,i||⋯||Ss+k−t,i)for1≤i≤s, and non-essential shadowsOi=(Ss+1,i||Ss+2,i||⋯||Ss+k−t,i)for(s+1)≤i≤n.Because the non-essential shadows of Li et al.'s [24] ESIS scheme and all shadows of Yang et al.'s [25] scheme are concatenated by sub-shadows of different SIS schemes. Thus, the locations of these sub-shadows in final shadows should be recorded so that we can extract the corresponding sub-shadows in reconstruction. Even though the locations are publicly announced in advance, we still need extra operations to extract sub-shadows from shadows. Therefore, it is necessary to design a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme, which generates single and same-sized sub-shadow for each shadow.In this paper, we use differential of a polynomial to design a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme. Unlike Guo et al.'s scheme [28], the secret pixels are only embedded into partial coefficients of polynomial. In the proposed scheme, essential and non-essential shadows have the same sizes. Additionally, every shadow is generated by a single SIS scheme so that we do not need extra extractions to obtain sub-shadows for reconstruction. Our ESIS scheme satisfies the threshold condition and the essentiality condition of(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme. Meanwhile, our scheme solves the problem of unequal sized shadows and the problem of concatenation of sub-shadows. Notations used in the proposed(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme and their descriptions are listed in Table 1.The original secret image should be permutated first to get the permuted imageIˆ. To avoid the leakage of information from shadows [2], all SIS schemes and ESIS schemes need this permutation phase to assure the randomness of shadow images. Fig. 2shows the workflow diagram of the proposed(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme. The formal encryption and decryption of our(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme are described in Algorithm 1and Algorithm 2.As shown in Algorithm 1, we embed t secret pixels into t coefficients (a0,a1,…, andat−1) (partial coefficients of(k−1)-degree polynomialf(x)). Using (k, s)-SIS scheme based onf(x), we generate s essential shadowsO1−Os. Afterwards, we calculate the t-th derivative off(x)to getf(t)(x). Associate every(k−t)coefficients off(t)(x)to form an intermediate imageI˜. Then, applying the(k−t,n−s)-SIS onI˜to generate(n−s)non-essential shadowsOs+1−On. In the revealing process, we need employ Birkhoff interpolation to reveal the secret image.Birkhoff interpolation is to find a polynomialf(x)of degreek−1such that certain derivatives have specified values at specified points [30]. In our scheme, the specified points are the ID of each shadows, and the specified values are the pixels' values of each shadow. The incidence matrixEn×t=(eij)of the Birkhoff interpolation is defined with all entries are either 0 or 1.eij=1if and only if the i-th point's specified value is generated by the j-th derivative of the polynomial. Therefore we have∑i,jeij=n. Actually, a Birkhoff interpolation problem does not always have a unique solution. Whether a Birkhoff interpolation has a unique solution depends on the incidence matrix E and the specified points. The solution of Birkhoff interpolation can be also equivalently transformed to finding the solution of the corresponding linear equations. If and only if the rank of the coefficient matrix of the linear equations is equal to k, the linear equations have unique solution, which means the corresponding Birkhoff interpolation problem also has the same solution.In the following theorem, we theoretically prove that our scheme satisfies the threshold condition and the essentiality condition in Eq. (1).Theorem 1The proposed scheme inAlgorithm 1is a(t,s,k,n)-ESIS scheme and has essential and non-essential shadows of the same size|I|/t.ProofTo prove the proposed scheme is a(t,s,k,n)-EISS scheme, we have to prove if and only if the threshold condition and the essentiality condition are satisfied, the permuted secret image can be recovered.We first prove that the violation of any one condition cannot recover the permuted image. Consider the case that the threshold condition is not satisfied, i.e.,l<k. First, supposel2≥(k−t). We recover the intermediate image viaI˜=Dk−t,n−s(Os+1,…,Os+l2)and obtain everyf(t)(x)fromI˜. By integrating t times, we derivef(x)and determine (k−t) coefficients (at,at+1,…,ak−1) off(x). However, there are still t unknown coefficients(a0,a1,…,at−1)off(x). Becausel<kandl2≥(k−t), we only havel1=(l−l2)<tequations for the polynomialf(x)with the information ofl1essential shadowsO1−Ol1. Thus, we cannot solve(a0,a1,…,at−1)off(x). Second, supposel2<(k−t). In this case, we cannot get the intermediate image by(k−t,n−s)-SIS scheme. Thus, we havel2equations forf(t)(x)with the information ofl2non-essential shadowsOs+1−Os+l2, which are equivalent to havel2equations forf(x). Meanwhile, we havel1equations forf(x)with the information ofl1essential shadowsO1−Ol1. Becausel1+l2=l, we have onlyl(<k)equations to solve k unknowns(a0,a1,…,ak−1). Thus, we cannot recover all coefficients off(x).Then we prove that the violation of the essentiality condition cannot recover the secret image. Supposel≥k, andl1<t, which meansl2=l−l1>(k−t). In this case, there are more than (k−t) non-essential shadows, thus we can constructl2>(k−t)equations to solve(k−t)coefficients off(t)(x). Then we get (k−t) coefficients(at,at+1,…,ak−1)off(x). However, we only havel1<tessential shadows. Hence we can only constructl1equations to solve the remain t coefficients off(x). Obviously, we cannot get the unique solution and recover the secret pixels(a0,a1,…,at−1).We now prove that when the threshold condition and the essentiality condition are satisfied we can reconstruct the permuted image. Two cases in Algorithm 2 are considered.Case 1:l1=tandl2=(k−t)For simplicity, suppose that the shadow IDs ofO1−Onare1,2,…, and n. The reconstruction can be accomplished using Birkhoff interpolation with the shadow IDsX={1,2,…,t,s+1,…,s+k−t}. Since we usef(x)andf(t)(x)to embed secret pixels, we have all-0 columns of E except for the first column and the t-th column. The incidence matrix E is generated as follows.(2)EX=(e1,0e1,1⋯e1,t−1e1,t⋮⋮⋮⋮et,0et,1et,t−1et,tet+1,0et+1,1et+1,t−1et+1,t⋮⋮⋮⋮es+1,0es+1,1⋱es+1,t−1es+1,t⋮⋮⋮⋮es+k−t,0es+k−t,1es+k−t,t−1es+k−t,tes+k−t+1,0es+k−t+1,1es+k−t+1,t−1es+k−t+1,t⋮⋮⋮⋮en,0en,1⋯en,t−1en,t)=(10⋯00⋮⋮⋮⋮1⋮⋮⋮0⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮0⋮⋮⋱⋮1⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮1⋮⋮⋮0⋮⋮⋮⋮00⋯00)The corresponding system of linear equations with k unknowns (a0,a1, …,ak−1) has the following coefficient matrixAX:(3)AX=(1011⋯1t1t+120212t2t+1⋮⋮⋮⋮t0t1tttt+100⋱(s+1)0×t!(s+1)1×(t+1)!1!⋮⋮(s+2)0×t!(s+2)1×(t+1)!1!⋮⋮⋮⋮00⋯(s+k−t)0×t!(s+k−t)1×(t+1)!1!⋯1k−12k−1⋮tk−1⋱(s+1)k−t−2×(k−1)!(k−t−1)!(s+2)k−t−2×(k−1)!(k−t−1)!⋮⋯(s+k−t)k−t−2×(k−1)!(k−t−1)!)The rank ofAXin Eq.

In step (A1-1), our essential shadows are generated by (k, s)-SIS scheme (Oi=Ek,s(Iˆ),1≤i≤s), by embedding every t pixels into one shadow pixel. Thus,SEP=|Iˆ|/t=|I|/t. In (A1-4), we useOi=Ek−t,n−s(I˜),(s+1)≤i≤n, and embed every (k−t) secret pixels into one shadow pixel. The size of non-essential shadow isSNP=|I˜|/(k−t)=(|I|×(k−t)/t)/(k−t)=|I|/t. Finally, essential shadows and non-essential shadows have the same sizeSEP=SNP=|I|/t. □As we proved in Theorem 1, the proposed scheme can achieve the same size of all shadows. In addition, our scheme generates shadows using derivative polynomial, and each shadow is generated by a single polynomial. Therefore, no concatenation operation is needed in our scheme. Obviously, our scheme can solve the two problems in schemes [24,25]: unequal size of shadows and the concatenation of sub-shadows.
