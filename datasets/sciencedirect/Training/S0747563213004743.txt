When adolescents receive sexual messages on the internet: Explaining experiences of risk and harm

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We examine the risk, and resulting harm, of receiving sexual messages online among adolescents.Increased psychological difficulties and sensation seeking increases the risk of receiving sexual messages.Increased psychological difficulties but decreased sensation seeking increases reported harm.Online and offline risk behaviors mediate the likelihood of risk but not harm.Identifying these risk factors will aid policy makers to target help on those who are more vulnerable.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article reports new findings on the incidence of risk and the associated experience of harm reported by children and adolescents aged 11–16, regarding receipt of sexual messages on the internet (known popularly as sexting). Findings showed that the main predictors of the risk of seeing or receiving sexual messages online are age (older), psychological difficulties (higher), sensation seeking (higher) and risky online and offline behavior (higher). By contrast, the main predictors of harm resulting from receiving such messages were age (younger), gender (girls), psychological difficulties (higher) and sensation seeking (lower), with no effect for risky online or offline behavior. The findings suggest that accounts of internet-related risks should distinguish between predictors of risk and harm. Since some exposure to risk is necessary to build resilience, rather than aiming to reduce risk through policy and practical interventions, the findings can be used to more precisely target those who experience harm in order to reduce harm overall from internet use.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Public, policy and research attention has recently been paid to the peer-to-peer exchange of sexual messages using digital technologies (known popularly as sexting). Such messages may be created and exchanged via text or image messaging on mobile phones, though they also include peer-to-peer messaging on diverse internet-enabled devices, particularly using social networking sites and instant messaging services. Although in some respects now part of the fun, flirtation and identity-experimentation central to teenage culture (Buckingham & Bragg, 2004; Hope, 2007; Ringrose, Gill, Livingstone, & Harvey, 2012; Willett & Burn, 2005), this exchange of sexual messages is attracting considerable public anxiety, amplified by the often exaggerated media coverage of particular cases (Draper, 2012; Haddon & Stald, 2009). This anxiety arises partly because of aggressive or coercive nature of some messages (for links with sexual harassment, see Burgess-Proctor, Patchin, & Hinduja, 2009; Salter, Crofts, & Lee, 2013; for links with grooming, see Palmer & Stacey, 2004), and partly even if voluntary, some images involved are sufficiently explicit as to be potentially illegal (Albury, Crawford, Byron, & Mathews, 2013; Arcabascio, 2010; Sacco, Argudin, Maguire, & Tallon, 2010; Willard, 2010).Considerable research efforts are underway to progress beyond the moral panic (Critcher, 2008) associated with the exchange of sexual messages so as to identify appropriate policy responses. This is urgent insofar as children and young people are adopting digital communication technologies rapidly, often far ahead of the adults charged with their safety and well-being.Thus far, researchers have struggled to agree on matters of definition and measurement, although this is vital if research is to produce robust evidence regarding prevalence, distribution and consequences (Lounsbury, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2011). In consequence, survey findings vary widely, ranging from a reported 7% (Mitchell, Finkelhor, Jones, & Wolak, 2012) to 15% (Lenhart, 2009) to as many as 48% (National Campaign to Support Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, 2008). Qualitative research adds further complications. Some studies find that adolescents’ own accounts emphasize the willing exchange of messages between romantic partners, typically involving self-generated images (Lenhart, 2009). They recognize that some adolescents who send and receive sexual messages find it fun or flirtatious, and it may even be seen as a form of creative media production (Hasinoff, 2012). Others distinguish primary from secondary sexting, arguing that different contexts apply to the voluntary creation and sending of a sexual image between partners and the subsequent circulation of such an image beyond the control of its creator (Lievens, 2012). Yet others recognize that there can be different forms of sexting, some harmful and some not (or, as Wolak & Finkelhor, 2011, term it, aggravated and experimental).Thus, while some studies of ‘sexting’ focus on the mere exchange of sexual messages, others build in an assumption of harm (by focusing on the exchange of unwelcome or hurtful sexual messages). These latter tend to regard the production and circulation of such messages as the digital extension of the long-standing coercive pressure on girls, typically exerted by boys in their peer group, to conform to particular sexual expectations (Albury et al., 2013; Ringrose et al., 2012; Sevcikova, Simon, Daneback, & Kvapilik, 2012). Some who create and send sexual images feel pressured to do so (National Campaign to Support Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, 2008) or are upset either on receiving such messages or when sexual messages they have created are circulated beyond the intended recipient (Phippen, 2012).Consequently, it is helpful to differentiate the prevalence of sexual messaging (which, as suggested by surveys, encompasses a sizable minority of adolescents) from reported responses (which, qualitative research suggests, are negative only for a further subset of those who see or receive such messages). To understand this distinction better, we draw on theories of risk (Aven & Renn, 2009; Breakwell, 2010) to distinguish risk (defined as the occurrence of an event which is associated with a probability of harm) from harm (defined as actual physical or mental damage as reported by the person concerned).At present, awareness-raising initiatives tend to address all children and young people, creating the perception of a widespread problem. Possibly it would help diffuse public anxiety if research could resolve the uncertainty regarding which adolescents are likely to encounter sexual messages or to be harmed as a result, enabling better targeting of safety initiatives to focus on the minority particularly at risk of actual harm. To progress this, we observe that although the internet-enabled technologies are a relatively recent addition to adolescents’ lives, much is already known regarding their vulnerability to risk in other domains (Donovan & Jessor, 1985; Jessor, 1991; Rutter, 1987; Schoon, 2006). Thus we turn to the well-established literature regarding risk and protective factors when examining the relatively new phenomena of such online risks as sexual messaging. Having argued above that risk and harm must be distinguished, it follows that the (offline) factors that influence adolescents’ well-being can have two distinct effects – on the likelihood of encountering risk and/or on the likelihood that a risk encounter is experienced as harmful.Adolescence is characterized by the tension between dependence and independence. Adolescents are motivated to assert their desires and exercise their abilities, both means of building resilience, but this faces them with a host of personal, relational and educational demands that test their competences and reveal their continuing need for support. Psychological, social and economic advantage or disadvantage is particularly likely to impact on well-being and life chances during adolescence, with some young people experiencing more risks than others, and with one form of disadvantage tending to compound another (Currie et al., 2008; Feinstein & Sabates, 2006; Schoon, 2006). Adolescence is also the life stage in which young people experiment with identity and sexuality, including testing themselves against the adult-created boundaries designed to keep them safe (Coleman & Hagell, 2007). Characterized as a period of increased risk-taking (e.g., Burke et al., 1997; van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2009), this too contributes to vicious or virtuous circles, with those engaging in one type of risk behavior being more likely to engage in others (e.g., Guilamo-Ramos, Litardo, & Jaccard, 2005; Rice et al., 2012).Recent approaches to the analysis of adolescent risk propose moving away from interventions designed for specific risk behaviors to embrace a more integrative approach focused on risk behaviors in general (Hale & Viner, 2012; Jackson, Henderson, Frank, & Haw, 2012). These are based on the notion of a general underlying risk factor, and assume that the personality or behavioral factors that lead people to engage in any one type of risk behavior will enhance the propensity to risks in general (Donovan & Jessor, 1985; Jessor, 1991). An influential personality factor associated with adolescent risk behavior is sensation seeking. Defined as the dispositional tendency to seek out new experiences, this is linked to a lack of inhibition and an attitude of risk-taking (Stephenson, Hoyle, Palmgreen, & Slater, 2003; Zuckerman, 1979, 1994). The motivational inclination of sensation seekers to look for new opportunities is associated with puberty-specific, maturational changes including sexual interest and emotional intensity (Steinberg et al., 2008). Sensation seekers find risky experiences more pleasurable and, in turn, this may contribute to resilience; conversely, those lower in sensation seeking are less likely to seek sensation-enhancing experiences and may be more easily upset when they encounter them (Farmer et al., 2001; Smith, Ptacek, & Smoll, 1992).Also linking risk and harm, adolescents’ psychological difficulties (such as emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and peer relationship problems as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ; Goodman, Ford, Simmons, Gatward, & Meltzer, 2003; Goodman, Meltzer, & Bailey, 1998) are associated with offline risks, online risks, and harm, apparently because they are associated with aggression and anxiety (Petermann, Petermann, & Schreyer, 2010; Sobanski et al., 2010) as well as disinhibition (SDQ total score: Minnis, Rabe-Hesketh, & Wolkind, 2002; SDQ hyperactivity and conduct problems subscales: Enoch, Steer, Newman, Gibson, & Goldman, 2010). Adolescents with psychological difficulties are more likely to encounter, or seek out risks online (Wells & Mitchell, 2008) and to employ maladaptive coping styles (Thabet, Tischler, & Vostanis, 2004), suggesting that psychological difficulties may not only predict risk but also vulnerability to harm in consequence.In terms of behavioral factors predicting risk online, the nature of the internet itself adds a further complication. The interactional distance it inserts between people, the ambiguity of its social norms, and the promise of exciting new opportunities online have combined to support risky youthful practices such as making one’s personal information public, looking for new contacts online, or pretending to be a different kind of person online (Baumgartner, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2010a; Livingstone, 2008).Supporting the idea of a common factor underlying various kinds of adolescents’ risk behaviors, it is generally assumed (although little demonstrated) that those who encounter risks offline are more likely to encounter risks online. This focus on propensity to risk recognizes the influence of personality (psychological difficulties, sensation seeking) and behavioral (risk-taking) factors which apply across domains, including across the offline/online boundary. Qualitative research has already shown that this boundary is much less salient to youth than to adults (boyd, 2008; Orgad, 2007). The hypothesis that those who encounter offline risks are more likely to encounter online risks, whether because of their personality or behavior, is supported by survey evidence (e.g., Palfrey, boyd, & Sacco, 2008; Wolak, Finkelhor, & Mitchell, 2008), clinical reports (Delmonico & Griffin, 2008; Mitchell & Wells, 2007; Palmer & Stacey, 2004), policy analysis (Byron, 2008) and criminal cases (CEOP, 2013).It is less clear whether the same factors that shape encounters with online risks also influence whether such risks result in harm. Supporting the idea that the same factors influence risk and harm, evidence suggests that adolescents with more psychological difficulties are both more likely to encounter risk online and also to be more vulnerable to harm associated with that risk (e.g. Wells & Mitchell, 2008; Wolak et al., 2008). On the other hand, supporting the idea that risk and harm require different explanations is the finding that, while sexual messaging is received by girls and boys equally, it is experienced more often as harassment by girls than by boys (Ringrose et al., 2012; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2008). Moreover, when risk is encountered as a result of greater sensation-seeking, that same orientation which leads to an increase in risk (Brady & Donenberg, 2006; Dowell, Burgess, & Cavanaugh, 2009; Slater, 2003; Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Cardador, 2004) may also enable adolescents to build resilience, thus reducing the likelihood of harm (Hasebrink, Görzig, Haddon, Kalmus, & Livingstone, 2011; Livingstone, Haddon, & Görzig, 2012; Valkenburg & Peter, 2008).Although the literature on online risks is growing, there is still insufficient basis to ground detailed hypotheses on the basis of an agreed theoretical framework. However, the above discussion offers a tentative ground to formulate some hypotheses regarding the possible influence of psychological difficulties and sensation seeking which are consistent with the literature on adolescent risk as well as emerging findings on internet use. Additionally, the claim of a common risk propensity leads us to hypothesize that those who encounter more offline risks (for example, drinking excessive alcohol or getting into trouble with the police) will also encounter more online risks. Although there is little theory linking risk to the demographic variables of age and gender, we include these variables in our analysis because surveys suggest that the exchange of sexual messages is more common among older than younger adolescents and more problematic for girls (Baumgartner, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2010b; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2008), and because of findings linking risk-taking to boys (Brady & Donenberg, 2006; Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999).It seems likely also that the nature of adolescent internet use matters, since young people who engage in more online activities encounter more risks as well as more opportunities (Livingstone & Helsper, 2010), possibly because they search more widely or have developed more digital skills. Although there is no easy line to be drawn between generally risky activities and those that carry a specific risk of harm, it may be that those who practice risky online activities (including identity and communication-related activities for which established norms of conduct and safety are undeveloped) also encounter more online risks. If so, as for sensation seeking or, indeed, risky offline activities, this increased exposure to risk may result in resilience rather than harm. Although such a hypothesis must remain tentative, we considered this worthy of investigation, partly because providing guidance on risky online activities has been and could yet be the focus of awareness-raising and safety guidance.As argued above, it is important to examine the influence of these factors on both risk (here, operationalized as receiving sexual messages online) and harm (operationalized as being upset by such messages). It is a strength of our study that, having measured these separately, we can examine the influence of the same factors on both. Thus we anticipate that higher psychological difficulties will be associated with higher risk and more harm, and that offline risk-taking, online risky activities and sensation seeking will be linked to more risk but less harm (insofar as repeated encounters with risk can build resilience). We also include in the analysis the variables of age, gender and internet use (operationalized as range of online activities) in order to control for and explore their effects before examining the variables of interest. Acknowledging the limited evidence base on which to ground our analysis, we hypothesize as follows:H1Adolescents are more likely to receive sexual messages online when they:Are higher in psychological difficultiesAre higher in sensation seekingEngage more in risky offline activitiesEngage more in risky online activitiesAdolescents are more likely to be upset by receiving sexual messages online when they:Are higher in psychological difficultiesAre lower in sensation seekingEngage less in risky online activitiesEngage less in risky offline activities
