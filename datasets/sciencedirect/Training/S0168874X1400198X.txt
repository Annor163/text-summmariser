@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new structure-preserving algorithm for simulating the nonlinear dynamics of geometrically exact rods is developed. The method is based on the simultaneous discretization in space and time of Hamilton׳s variational principle. The resulting variational integrator is explicit, second-order accurate and can be identified with a Lie-group symplectic partitioned Runge–Kutta method for finite element discretizations of rods involving large rotations and displacements. Numerical examples allow to verify that the algorithm presents an excellent long term energy behavior along with the exact conservation of the momenta associated to the symmetries of the system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The formulation of continuum based theories for rods has captured the interest of researchers during decades [60]. The motivation for developing such theories is rooted in attempting to model complex physical problems arising in the dynamics of slender solids by means of a dimensionally reduced approach. This point of view has boosted the construction of models depending on one spatial variable and the time [1,73].One of the most successful models11An alternative to geometrically exact models is given by the co-rotational approach for rods, see for example [15].for describing the dynamics of elastic rods undergoing finite deformation has been proposed by Simo in [65]. This geometrically exact formulation follows a director-type approach to describe the kinematics of the rods and corresponds to a three-dimensional generalization of Reissner׳s original model [60,61]. In a posterior work, Simo and Vu-Quoc [69,70] proposed a numerical scheme based on combining the finite element method (FEM) with a modified version of Newmark׳s scheme for time integration. Other authors have also made highlighting contributions. For example, an initially curved reference configuration for the rod has been considered in [31,32,37]. A total Lagrangian formulation has been proposed in [11] and revisited in [47]. Some important numerical issues such as the construction of non-locking elements or frame-indifferent formulations can be consulted in [8,35,62,63]. An alternative formulation based on some concepts of geometric (Clifford) algebra is presented in [58]. The list of works largely exceeds the mentioned ones, which only constitute some relevant examples; a more complete survey can be consulted in [53].From the point of view of the applications, this formulation has also received considerable attention. In [72] Simo and Vu-Quoc applied the model to study the dynamics of earth-orbiting flexible satellites with multibody components. It has also been used for studying the dynamics of flexible mechanisms [7,10], robotic technology [78], the coupled geometric and constitutive nonlinear response of structures and buildings in the static [56] and dynamic cases [57], including applications to passive control in earthquake engineering [73,53]. The application of the model to the study of slender structures made of composite materials has been carried out in [75–77].The formulation of time integrators for the Reissner–Simo theory of elastic rods results to be a particularly challenging task since the model describes a dynamical system evolving on a nonlinear manifold rather than on a linear space. Several approaches have been proposed in order to design time integrators respecting the geometry of the configuration space. The design of structure-preserving algorithms for dynamics of rigid bodies is closely linked to the design of new methods for elastic rods. In this sense, Simo and Wong [71] developed a midpoint algorithm onSO(3)22The symbolSO(3)denotes the non-commutative group of proper rotations [47].which conserves the total energy and the norm of the total momentum. They also formulated an implicit energy and momentum conserving algorithm. In [70] Newmark׳s method was extended to includeSO(3)yielding to a scheme able to handle arbitrarily large rotations and displacements. Even though this scheme has demonstrated to be useful in several applications [11], Mäkinen states [46] that it only constitutes an approximated version of the correct formulas, which are given in [2].In spite of the above results, it is widely recognized that Newmark׳s family of implicit schemes fails to preserve the invariants of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems with symmetry [68]. Moreover, the stability and accuracy properties are not guaranteed in the nonlinear range [3,4]. A further step towards the development of robust schemes is given by formulation of the so-called the energy and momentum conserving (E–M) methods. They have been extended to elastic rods by Simo et al. in [67]. An alternative to E–M methods is given by the symplectic-momentum methods which are characterized by the preservation of certain skew-symmetric bilinear form on the phase space33The simultaneous conservation of the total energy and the symplectic structure is not possible for methods with constant time step [36,41,22].along with the exact conservation of the momenta associated to symmetries of the Lagrangian. A comparison between symplectic and E–M schemes is presented in [24]. First-order accurate algorithms that exhibit controllable energy dissipation and momentum conservation are formulated in [3] and second-order methods can be found in [4].More recently, the attention have been turned towards the so-called variational integrators (VI) which are methods obtained from a discrete version of Hamilton׳s principle for conservative systems [51,52,59,79]. These methods present remarkable properties among which are: (i) they are symplectic, (ii) they exactly conserve the momenta associated to the symmetries of a discrete Lagrangian and (iii) they show an excellent long time energy behavior. Moreover, higher order methods can be constructed following a systematic procedure. An overview of the method can be found in [44] and the case of continuum systems in considered in [49,81]. The construction of asynchronous VI׳s is carried out in [43] and development of generalized Galerkin VI׳s, including dynamical systems evolving on Lie groups, can be consulted in [41,39,40]. In summary, variational methods constitute an extraordinarily versatile framework for the systematic construction of structure-preserving time integrators [29] that can be applied to a wide variety of problems arising in different fields of science and engineering [41,55]. However, the variational techniques have not been applied to formulate structure-preserving methods for geometrically exact rods.Innovative numerical models of elastic rods are currently used in a wide range of subjects areas such as computational biophysics, the dynamics of interacting biomolecules and filaments, synthetic polymers and new materials based on nano-technologies. For example, in [38] a numerical model for the dynamics of viscous Kirchhoff rods is used for studying problems of biological significance, including the super-coiling and instability in closed rods and the self-assembly behavior of fibril structures such as certain types of bacteria. Goriely and Tabor [25–27] study certain theoretical aspects of Kirchhoff׳s rods with applications in the numerical simulation of thin filaments. The application of rod models to the study the growth of certain plants can be consulted in [28]. In [23] a theory of elastic filaments is extended to consider biological systems that display competition between two helical structures of opposite chirality. Balaeff et al. [6] extend the classical Kirchhoff׳s model applied to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to account for sequence-dependent intrinsic twist and curvature, anisotropic rotational stiffness and electrostatic interactions. Yang et al. [80] construct a finite element (FE) model for inextensible elastic rods including self-contact and use it for modelling a DNA polymer composed of thousands of base pairs. A survey about the numerical modelling of super-helical DNA can be consulted in [64]. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate robust time integrators for simulating the dynamics of rods undergoing complex morphological changes.In this work, a new explicit variational integrator for simulating the dynamics of geometrically exact rods is formulated. Its construction is built on the simultaneous discretization in space and time of the action functional. To this end, the finite element method is applied the continuum problem to obtain a finite-dimensional semi-discrete problem. Then, standard procedures in variational integration are applied on the nodal variables of the mesh to formulate a structure-preserving Lie-group partitioned Runge–Kutta method. The new time integrator enjoys a number of remarkable features: (i) it is explicit if an appropriate quadrature rule is used to compute the discrete kinetic energy, (ii) it is symplectic, (iii) it exactly conserves the momenta associated to the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian, (iv) it is second-order accurate, (v) it shows an energy drift that remains bounded over exponentially long periods of times and, (vi) since it is explicit, it avoids using iterative schemes to solve large systems of nonlinear equations.In this section the Lagrangian point of view of the mechanics is considered to deduce the balance equations for geometrically exact rods in finite deformation. Special emphasis is given to the non-linear nature of the configuration manifold. Additionally, the Hamiltonian structure of the problem is also addressed along with the invariants of the dynamics.Kinematics: Let{Ei}and{ei}be the material and spatial inertial frames, which are orthogonal and coincident.44Notation: Latin and Greek indexes range over {1,2,3} and {2,3}, respectively. The symbols(•),x,(•)̇andSO(3)denote differentiation with respect to x, time differentiation and the linear space of skew-symmetric tensors, respectively.The reference configuration is given by a straight rod of length L with constant cross sectionA⊂R2. Then, the position vector of a material point in this configuration isX(s,ξ1,ξ2)=sE1+ξ1E1+ξ2E2,wheres∈[0,L]is an arch-length coordinate and(ξ1,ξ2)∈Aare coordinates on the cross section. The reference curveφ0is defined as the geometric place of all the points of the formX(s,0,0). The position vector of a material point in the current configuration is given by(1)x(s,ξ1,ξ2)=φ(s)+ξ1t1(s)+ξ2t2(s),where the spatial curveφ:[0,L]→R3is obtained by adding a displacement ontoφ0and the vectorsti=ΛEiwithΛ:[0,L]→SO(3)define an orthonormal coordinate system characterizing the current orientation of the cross-section [65,37], see Fig. 1.The configuration space,Q, is the set of all the smooth-enough fields(2)Φ≡(φ,Λ):[0,L]→R3×SO(3),subjected to the prescribed boundary conditionsΦ(0)=Φ0andΦ(L)=ΦLand to the restrictionφ,s·t1>0[67]. Due to the non-commutative nature ofSO(3),Qresults to be a nonlinear differentiable manifold [50,68]. Thereby, using the spatial rule to update rotations, we obtain that admissible variations onΦ∈Qare given by elements of the form(u,θ˜Λ)∈TΦQwhere(3)(u,θ˜):[0,L]→R3×so(3).If we consider a time interval of interest[0,T], a motion of the rod is given by a curveΦ(·):[0,T]→Q. The corresponding velocity isΦ̇=(φ̇,Λ̇)which yields to the following expression for the velocity of a material point:(4)ẋ=φ̇+ΛV˜Z=φ̇+v˜z,whereZ=β2E2+β3E3and(5)V˜=ΛtΛ̇,is the material form of the angular velocity tensor. The corresponding spatial forms arez=ΛZandv˜=ΛV˜Λt.Strains: The material form of the cross sectional strain measures [37,66] are the strain vector,Γ=Λtφ,s−E1,, and the curvature tensorΩ˜=ΛtΛ,s. The corresponding spatial forms are given byγ=ΛΓandω˜=ΛΩ˜Λt, respectively.Stresses: It will be assumed that the rod is made of an isotropic, homogeneous, hyper-elastic material and that{tβ}are oriented along principal axes of the cross section. Following previous works [32,33,65,67], we consider a stored energy function per unit of reference lengthψ(Γ,Ω)such that the material form of the stress resultants and stress couples are given by(6)nm=∂ψ(Γ,Ω)∂Γ=CΓΓandmm=∂ψ(Γ,Ω)∂Ω=CΩΩ,whereΩis the axial vector ofΩ˜and,CΓandCΩare the following cross sectional constitutive tensors:CΓ=diag[EA,GA,GA]andCΩ=diag[GJ,EI2,EI3],where A is the cross sectional area and E, G, J, I2 and I3 are an elastic modulus, a shear modulus, a torsional stiffness and two flexural stiffnesses, respectively. The corresponding spatial forms aren=Λnm,m=ΛmmThe Lagrangian point of view of the mechanics is based on variational principles [51]. Often, it is preferred over other approaches due to its potential in the development of computational applications [20,36,39–41,43,44]. Basically, this approach consists in constructing the Lagrangian function of the system and then using Hamilton׳s variational principle to deduce the equations of motion. Hamilton׳s principle states that the trajectory of the system is a critical point of the action computed on the space of trajectories joining two fixed points on the configuration space. See [81] for a recent survey in the context of elasticity. In this section, this procedure is carried out for geometrically exact elastic rods.Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy,K:TQ→R, is given by(7)K(Φ,Φ̇)=12∫0L(Aρφ̇·φ̇−Tr[V˜EρV˜])ds,where the cross sectional mass densityAρand the cross sectional material tensorEρare given by(8)Aρ=∫Aρ0dAandEρ=Λt(∫Aρ0z⊗zdA)Λ,respectively.Potential energy: We assume that the potential energy,U:Q→R, is given by the sum of two components according toU(Φ)=Uint(Φ)+Uext(Φ),whereUint,Uext:Q→Rare given by(9a)Uint(Φ)=∫0Lψ(Γ,Ω)ds,(9b)Uext(Φ)=−∫0Lwext(φ,Λ)ds,wherewext(Φ)is a potential function for the loads applied on the system. Simo et al. [67] demonstrated that ifwextis left invariant under the action of rotations, then necessarilyUext(Φ)=Uext(Λtφ).Hamilton׳s principle: The Lagrangian functionL:TQ→Ris constructed as the kinetic minus the potential energy of the system [50], i.e.,(10)L(Φ,Φ̇)=K(Φ̇)−U(Φ).Moreover, we consider the setCcomposed by all the smooth enough motionsΦ:[0,T]→Qand we construct the action functionalS:C→Ras(11)S[Φ(·)]=∫0TL(Φ,Φ̇)dt.Hamilton׳s principle states that the trajectory followed by the system is a stationary point of the action under all variations inCthat leaves fixed the end pointsΦ(0)=Φ(T)=0. Due to the non-linear nature ofCcomputingδS=0results to be a non-trivial task [69] which yields to the following Euler–Lagrange equations:(12a)Aρd2dt2φ==n,s+N,(12b)ddt(skew[iρv])=m˜,s+φ˜,sn˜−n˜φ˜,s+M˜,which have to be supplemented with adequate initial conditions. In the above equationsiρis the spatial form of the inertial tensor,Na vector of the external forces andM˜a skew-symmetric tensor of external moments. The details to obtain (12a) and (12b) are omitted here but given in the accompanying Appendix. Alternatively, (12b) can be given in terms of axial vectors as(13)ddt(iρv)=m,s+φ,s×n+M.Hamiltonian mechanics [50] provides an alternative framework to study the dynamics of geometrically exact rods [17]. However, it has been less considered in the literature. Notable exceptions are [9,45] where energy-momentum algorithms are developed. In this section we present some basic concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics in order to deduce Hamilton׳s equations for elastic rods along with the invariants of the dynamics.Legendre transforms: Momentum densities(p,π˜):[0,L]→R3×SO(3)are introduced by mean of the following Legendre transforms:(14a)∫0Lp·δφ̇ds=ddϵL(…,φ̇ϵ,…)|ϵ=0=∫0LAρφ̇·δφ̇ds,(14b)∫0LTr[δθ˜̇π˜]ds=ddϵL(…,Λ̇ϵ,…)|ϵ=0=∫0LTr[δθ˜̇skew[iρv]]ds,from which it is clear thatp=Aρφ̇andπ˜=skew[iρv]. Note that(φ,Λ,p,Λtπ˜)belongs to the co-tangent bundleT⁎Q. Alternatively, it is possible to consider the axial vectorπ=iρv[68,67].Hamilton׳s equations: Rewriting the kinetic energy in terms of(p,π)it is possible to define the Hamiltonian functionH:T⁎Q→RasH(p,π,Φ)=K(p,π)+U(Φ)=12∫0L(Aρ−1p·p+iρ−1π·π)ds+U(Φ).Moreover, following standard procedures in classical mechanics (see e.g. [48,66]) Hamilton׳s equations are obtained as(15a)φ̇=Aρ−1p,(15b)Λ̇=skew[iρ−1π]Λ,(15c)ṗ=n,s+N,(15d)π˜̇=m˜,s+φ˜,sn˜−n˜φ˜,s+M˜.Note that (15d) can be replaced byπ̇=m,s+φ,s×n+M.Conserved quantities: In virtue of Noether׳s theorem [50] there exist as many conserved quantities as symmetries of the Lagrangian. In the present case, the following conserved quantities are identified:(i)The Lagrangian of system is autonomous and therefore, invariant under translations in time. This property yields to the conservation of energy which may easily verified by computingḢ=0,after considering (15a) to (15d).The Lagrangian is invariant under rigid body translations and rotations in space. The conserved quantities associated to these symmetries are the total linear momentum,Lt, and total angular momentum,Jt, which are given by(16)Lt=∫0LpdsandJt=∫0L(φ×p+π)ds.The above quantities are conserved by the dynamics if the external loading is self-equilibrated and the prescribed boundary conditions are of the Neumann type [51,49,67,66].In this section a second-order accurate time integrator for finite element discretizations of geometrically exact rods is formulated. We follow a standard methodology in variational integration to construct algorithms that automatically enjoy a number of remarkable properties: (i) they are symplectic, (ii) they exactly preserve the momenta associated to symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian, (iii) they show an excellent long term energy stability, and (iv) they preserve the geometric structure of the configuration manifold of the problem [43,44,51,52].The discretization in space of the continuum problem is carried out with the help of the finite element method. We consider a partitionThof the domain[0,L]inNenon-overlapping elements. The resulting mesh is characterized by the length h of the largest finite element. On each element,Ie, a local one-dimensional finite element spacePm(Ie)of polynomial functions of degreem≥0is defined.The basic idea consist in approximatingQby means of a finite-dimensional subspaceQhcomposed by elements of the form(φh,Λh)which are finite-dimensional approximations to(φ,Λ). In following, calculations are performed on the basis of a generic finite elementIe.(i)We consider first the translational part of the motion. Then,φh:Ie→R3is given by(17)φh(s)=∑a=1ndNa(s)φa,s∈Ie,whereφa=(φa1,…,φa3)is the position vector of the node a and{Na}a=1ndis a set of Lagrangian basis functions forPm(Ie)[30].It is worth noting thatφh(s)belongs toR3for any value ofs∈Iesince the nodal valuesφaalso belongsR3. This is always the case when we are interpolating nodal variables that belong to a linear space. For example, if we know the nodal values of any skew-symmetric tensor,w˜a∈SO(3), such as the angular velocity or the curvature, we can constructw˜h:Ie→SO(3)as(18)w˜h(s)=∑a=1ndNa(s)w˜a,s∈Ie.In the general case, if the nodal variables do not belongs to a linear space, the above interpolation yields to approximations which do not belong to the same space as the nodal variables. This is the case with the rotational part of the motion as we explain below.Since the rotation group is a non-linear manifold rather than a linear space, (17) cannot be applied. Therefore, in general, we have that(19)∑a=1ndNa(s)Λa∉SO(3),s∈Ie.To construct a geometrically consistent approximation forΛh:Ie→SO(3)we do not apply the classical Rodrigues׳s formula for the exponential map [15] since this operation does not provide a representation free of singularities for arbitrary rotations. Instead, we adopt the following procedure proposed in [63]:•We consider a representation of the nodal values of the rotation tensors in terms of unit quaternions.55Theoretical aspect about unit quaternions can be consulted e.g. in [58,15].This representation is unique for arbitrary rotations. The nodal values of the unit quaternions{qa}a=1ndare obtained from{Λa}a=1ndby means of applying the well known Spurrier׳s algorithm[74].The nodal values of the rotation vectors{Φa}a=1ndare extracted from{qa}a=1ndwith the help of the procedure given in [69].Since rotation vectors belong to a linear space,Φh(s)can be obtained by applying (17). Then,qh(s)is computed following standard procedures (see e.g. [15, Chapter XVI]).Finally,Λh(s)is obtained fromqh(s)by applying the classical relation between rotation tensors and quaternions.The construction of a semi-discrete counterpart of the Lagrangian functional (10) is build on the introduction of the FE interpolation of the (time-dependent) configuration variables(φh(t),Λh(t))in (7), (9a) and (9b) along with specifying appropriate quadrature rules to compute the corresponding volume integrals. Then, the semi-discrete kinetic energyKh:TQh×R→Rand the internal and external components of the potential energyUint,Uext:Qh×R→Rare given by(21a)Kh(Φh(t),Φ̇h(t))=12∑i=1Nlwi(Aρ∥φ̇h(ξi,t)∥2−Tr[V˜h(ξi,t)EρV˜h(ξi,t)]),(21b)Uhint(Φh,t)=∑i=1Ngwiψ(Γh(ξi,t),Ωh(ξi,t)),(21c)Uhext(Φh)=∑i=1Ngwiwext(φh(ξi),Λh(ξi)),where{wi,ξi}i=1Nl,{wi,ξi}i=1Ngare quadrature points and weights over[0,L],Γh(ξi)=Λht(ξi)φh,(ξi)s−E1andΩ˜h(ξi)=Λht(ξi)Λh,(ξi)s. The semi-discrete Lagrangian is then constructed asLh=Kh−Uhand the application of Hamilton׳s principle allows to obtain the corresponding EL equations on the nodes of the mesh.The values of the (semi-discrete) nodal momenta are computed with the help of the Legendre transform as(22a)pa(t)=∑b=1ndmabφ̇b(t),(22b)Π˜a(t)=∑i=1NlwiNa(ξi)skew[Iρ(ξi)Vh(ξi,t)],a∈{1,…,nd},wheremis given in 51b,Iρis the material form ofiρandVhthe FE interpolation of the material form of the angular velocity vector. Semi-discrete counterpart of Hamilton׳s Eqs. (15a)–(15d) can also be deduced.The time interval[0,T]is partitioned intoN>1subintervals with constant time stepΔt=T/N, and we settk=kT/N,k=0,1,…,N. We denote by(23)(φak,Λak),a∈{1,…,nt},the approximation of the nodal values of the configuration variables,(φa(tk),Λak(tk)), and the procedures described in Section 3.1 are used to compute(φhk(s),Λhk(s))as the approximation to(φh(s,tk),Λh(s,tk))for alls∈Ie,∀Ie⊂Th.The translational velocity is approximated by(24)φ̇h(s,τ)≈φhk+1(s)−φhk(s)Δt,(s,τ)∈Ie×(tk,tk+a),and time derivative of the rotational tensor by(25)Λh(s,τ)≈Λhk+1(s)−Λhk(s)Δt,(s,τ)∈Ie×(tk,tk+a).Approximations (24) and (25), which are discontinuous across time interval boundaries, can be obtained following the standard methodology to construct Galerkin variational integrators (see e.g. [36,41,51,52]). Moreover, higher order methods can be systematically formulated by means of combining higher degree polynomials with higher order quadrature rules to compute the discrete Lagrangian. A complete analysis of Galerkin VI׳s and their relation with Runge–Kutta time integrators can be found in [43,79]. In [54] a fourth-order method for thermo-elastic problems is presented and the formulation of methods for dynamical problems evolving on Lie-group manifolds can be consulted in [41].Discrete Lagrangian and discrete action sum: The fully discrete (in space and time) counterpart of the kinetics energy,Kd:Qh×Qh→R, is obtained by replacingφ̇hby (24) andΛ̇hby (25) in (21a) to obtain(26)Kd=12(Δt)2∑i=1Nlwi(Aρ∥φhk+1(ξi)−φhk(ξi)∥2+2Tr[(I−Λh(k)t(ξi)Λhn+1(ξi))Eρ]).Correspondingly, the discrete potential energy,Ud:Qh→R, is given by(27)Ud=Udint+Udext=∑i=1Ngwi(ψ(Γhk(ξi),Ω˜hk(ξi))−wext(φhk(ξi),Λhk(ξi))).Moreover, we consider the scalarα∈[0,1]and apply the so-called generalized trapezoidal rule[52] to construct a discrete Lagrangian,(28)Ldα(Φh0,Φh1)=Δt(Kd(Φh0,Φh1)−αUd(Φh0)−(1−α)Ud(Φh1)),which is an approximation to the action functional on the time interval[t0,t1].RemarkIt is worth noting thatLd1/2is equivalent to the discrete Lagrangian obtained by means of using a two-point Gauss–Lobbato quadrature rule in time to approximate∫t0t1Lh(Φh(t),Φ̇h(t))dt.The corresponding VI results to be a member of the standard Lobatto IIIA–IIIB symplectic-partitioned Runge–Kutta methods [52]. Moreover, it is possible to show thatLd1/2is equivalent to the symmetric discrete LagrangianLdsym=Δt2L(Φh0,Φh1−Φh0Δt)+Δt2L(Φh1,Φh1−Φh0Δt),and therefore, according to [36, Theorem 3.1] the corresponding variational algorithm results to be a Lie group specialization of the classical Newmark׳s method withβ=0andγ=1/2(also known as central differences). However, the resulting method is explicit only if appropriate quadrature rules are used to compute (26) and (27). Details are given belowThe discrete action sum is given by(29)Sdα(Φh0,…,ΦhN)=∑k=0N−1Ldα(Φhk,Φhk+1),which is an approximation to (11).Discrete Hamilton׳s principle and DEL equations: The discrete counterpart of Hamilton׳s principle states that the evolution equations extremize (29) given fixed end points,{Φa0}a=1Ntand{ΦaN}a=1Nt. Extremizing the action sum is equivalent to enforcing(30)δSdα(Φh0,…,ΦhN)=0,for arbitrary variations on the nodal values of the configuration variables{Φak}a=1Ntandk∈{0,‥,N}. Details are given in the accompanying appendix (Section A.2).Hamilton׳s principle yields the discrete Euler–Lagrange equations (DEL):(31a)∑b=1ndmab(φbk+1−2φbk−φbk−1)(Δt)2=sak+Sak,(31b)Ra(k)t−Ra(k−1)t−Rak+Ra(k−1)(Δt)2=h˜ak+H˜ak,a∈{1,…,nd},wherem,sakandSakare the mass matrix, the nodal value of the internal force vector and the nodal value of the externally applied force vector. Moreover,Rak,h˜akandH˜akare the nodal values of the rotational inertia, the internal moment tensor and the externally applied moment tensor, respectively. Explicit expressionsm,sak,Sak,Rak,h˜akandH˜akare given in Appendix A.Eqs. (31a) and (31b) (which do not depend on α) may be interpreted as the balance of translational forces and moments on each node of the mesh, respectively. They in fact provide a method to computeΦak+1(∀a) if we knowΦakandΦak−1. If the body is subjected to non-conservative forces and moments, Lagrange–D׳Alembert principle can be used in deriving the modified DEL equations (see e.g. [36]).Discrete Legendre transformations: Initial conditions are often given in terms of positions and momenta rather than in terms of two positions as required in (31a) and (31b). However, it is possible to rewrite the integrator in position-momentum form taking advantage of the discrete Legendre transform [43,44,52].On one hand, we compute the translational momenta as follows:(32a)pak=−∇φakLdα=∑b=1ndmabφbk+1−φbkΔt+αΔt(sak+Sak),(32b)pak+1=∇φak+1Ldα=∑b=1ndmabφak+1−φakΔt−(1−α)Δt(sak+1+Sak+1),for alla∈{1,…,nd}.For the rotational part the following relation holds:Tr[δθ˜ak(−DVakLdα)]=Tr[δθ˜akπak],withπak=−DVakLdα=−RakΔt−αΔt2(h˜ak+H˜ak).It is clear that (DVakLdα+πak) has to be symmetric sinceδθ˜akis skew-symmetric and therefore, the nodal value of the rotational momentumΠ˜akis given by(33a)Π˜ak=πak−πa(k)t=Ra(k)t−RakΔt−αΔt(h˜ak+H˜ak),andΠ˜ak+1by(33b)Π˜ak+1=Ra(k)t−RakΔt+(1−α)Δt(h˜ak+1+H˜ak+1).Rearranging (32a) and (33a) allows to obtain the following updating scheme:(34a)∑b=1ndmabφbk+1=∑b=1ndmabφbk+Δt(pak−αΔt(sak+Sak)),(34b)Ra(k)t−Rak=Δt(Π˜ak+αΔt(h˜ak+H˜ak))and subtracting (32a) from (32b) and (33a) from (33b), yields to the following relations:(35a)pak+1=pak−Δt(sak+α+Sak+α),(35b)Π˜ak+1=Π˜ak+Δt(h˜ak+α+H˜ak+α),where(•)ak+α=(1−α)(•)ak+1+α(•)ak.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work, a new second-order accurate variational integrator for simulating the dynamics of geometrically exact rods is presented. To this end, the Reissner–Simo׳s theory of elastic rods in finite deformation is revisited giving special emphasis to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian point of views of the problem. Technical issues regarding to the nonlinear nature of the configuration manifold are discussed. The discretization in space of the continuum problem is based on the finite element method. Special attention is given to the way in which rotations are interpolated to avoid singularities. Regarding to the discretization of the problem in time, a standard methodology for formulating Lie group variational integrators is used. The method is based on constructing a discrete counterpart of Hamilton׳s principle to deduce discrete analogues of the Euler–Lagrange equations. Additionally, the discrete Legendre transform allows to obtain a position-momentum form of the method. The discrete flow results to be symplectic and exactly conserves the invariants associated to the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian. An explicit method is obtained if the kinetic term of the Lagrangian is computed using a Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rule. Numerical examples allow to verify the excellent performance of the developed method. In particular, the exact conservation of momenta associated to symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian and a remarkably good long term energy behavior are evidenced. Future work should consider including self-contact between different parts of the rod along with parallel asynchronous integration.
