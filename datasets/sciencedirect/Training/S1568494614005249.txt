@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper applied fuzzy set theory based on modified SERVQUAL model to analysis service quality in certification & inspection industry in China. The study consists of 405 randomly selected participants who are customers of China Certification & Inspection Company (CCIC). It includes four parts: introduction, methodology, a case study of certification & inspection service quality and conclusions. Study shows that the five dimensions of tangible have the biggest gap between the service quality expectations and perceptions. So, the company we studied (CCIC) need to increase investment in tangible aspects in order to improve their service quality.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Service quality is more difficult to be evaluated than commodity quality, but it plays an especially important role in firms to improve customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. For measuring the service quality, a 22-item questionnaire instrument called SERVQUAL was proposed by Parasuraman et al. [1]. Since then, the SERVQUAL questionnaire has been used to analyze service quality within diverse organizations, such as retailing organizations [2], airline industry [3], restaurants [31], hotel [4,23,33], higher education [5,26], urban transportation [6,7], public or private health care [8,9,10,11,27,35], information system [12], e-learning [14], hot spring industry [13,37], condominium management [28,32], Internet service [14,24,29,36], supply chain [15], banking [16]; [21], logistics industry [17], alcohol treatment [34], enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems [18], library [30], telecommunication sector [5], tourism industry [19], online travel agencies [22], after-sale Service in Manufacturing [25], public service [20]ï¼Œ crisis and emergency management [38], and so on. But SERVQUAL has not been applied to certification & inspection industry so far.This paper applied fuzzy set theory based on modified SERVQUAL model to analysis service quality in certification & inspection industry in China.
