@&#ABSTRACT@&#
ObjectiveThe existing methods of fuzzy soft sets in decision making are mainly based on different kinds of level soft sets, and it is very difficult for decision makers to select a suitable level soft set in most instances. The goal of this paper is to present an approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making to avoid selecting a suitable level soft set and to apply this approach to solve medical diagnosis problems.MethodsThis approach combines grey relational analysis with the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. It first utilizes grey relational analysis to calculate the grey mean relational degree, by which we calculate the uncertain degree of various parameters. Then, on the basis of the uncertain degree, the suitable basic probability assignment function of each independent alternative with each parameter can be obtained. Next, we apply Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion to aggregate these alternatives into a collective alternative, by which these alternatives are ranked and the best alternative is obtained. Finally, we compare this approach with the mean potentiality approach.ResultsThe results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach vis-a-vis the mean potentiality approach, Feng's method, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Naive Bayes’ classification method because the measure of performance of this approach is the same as that of the mean potentiality approach, and the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from the initial mean 0.3821 to 0.0069 in an application of medical diagnosis.ConclusionAn approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making by combining grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is introduced. The advantages of this approach are discussed. A practical application to medical diagnosis problems is given.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In 1999, Molodtsov [1] initiated soft set theory as a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties. Unlike traditional tools for dealing with uncertainties, such as the theory of probability, the theory of fuzzy sets [2], and the theory of rough sets [3], the advantage of soft set theory is that it is free from the inadequacy of the parametrization tools of those theories. Recently, there has been rapid growth in interest in soft set theory. Many efforts have been devoted to further generalizations and extensions of soft sets. Maji et al. [4,5] studied soft set theory and defined fuzzy soft sets by combining soft sets with fuzzy sets. The study of hybrid models combining soft sets or fuzzy soft sets with other mathematical structures and new operations is emerging as an active research topic of soft set theory [6,7]. Aktas et al. [8] initiated soft groups. Jun applied soft set theory to BCK/BCI-algebras [9–11]. Feng et al. [12] defined soft semirings and established a connection between soft sets and semirings. Li et al. [13] discussed relationships among soft sets, soft rough sets and topologies. Li et al. [14] investigated soft coverings. With the rapid development of soft set theory, applications of soft sets are progressing rapidly as well. Soft set theory has been proved to be useful in many kinds of fields, such as data analysis [15], forecasting [16], simulation [17], rule mining [18] and decision making [17–21].Recently, applications of soft sets in decision making have attracted more and more attention. To cope with fuzzy soft sets-based decision making problems, Cagˇman et al [20,23] presented soft matrix theory and the uni-int decision making approach, which selected a set of optimum elements from different alternatives. Moreover, Roy and Maji [22] discussed score value as the evaluation basis for finding an optimal choice object in fuzzy soft sets. However, Kong et al. [24] argued that the Roy-Maji method was incorrect by using a counter example, and they combined two evaluation bases of choice value and score value by grey relational analysis to make decisions in a fuzzy soft set. Later, Feng et al. [25] applied level soft sets to discuss fuzzy soft sets-based decision making. Jiang et al. [26] generalized the adjustable approach to fuzzy soft sets- based decision making and presented an adjustable approach to intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets-based decision making by using level soft sets of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. Based on Feng’ works, Basu et al. [27] further investigated the previous methods to fuzzy soft sets in decision making and introduced the mean potentiality approach, which was showed more efficient and more accurate than the previous methods. In addition, Xiao et al. [28] gave a new evaluation method based on Dempster–Shafer generalized fuzzy soft sets and applied this method in medical diagnosis problems.For methods for decision making in fuzzy soft sets, there is no unique or uniform criterion for the selection. Although researchers focus on approaches to the evaluation basis such as choice value, score value, or other evaluation bases to construct different kinds of level soft sets, the same decision problem may obtain different results from various evaluation bases and suitable level soft sets. As a result, it is difficult to judge which result is right, and we do not know whose level soft set should be chosen for selecting the optimal choice object. The key to this problem is how to reduce subjectivity and uncertainty when we choose the decision-making method. Then, it is necessary to pay attention to this issue, and we should try to study another approach to fuzzy soft sets-based decision making to avoid the above problems.Grey relational analysis is an important method to reflect uncertainty in grey system theory initiated by Deng [29], which is utilized for generalizing estimates under small samples and uncertain conditions. It has been successfully applied to solving decision-making problems [28–31].Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence proposed by Dempster [34] originated from the upper and lower probabilities, and then, Shafer [35] refined and developed it. It is a powerful method for combining accumulative evidence of changing prior opinions in the light of new evidence. Compared to probability theory, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence captures more information to support decision making by identifying uncertain and unknown evidence. It provides a mechanism to derive solutions from various forms of vague evidence without having much prior information. It is well known that Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence has been successfully applied in many fields such as intelligent medical diagnosis [28,36], knowledge reduction [37], fault diagnosis [38], multi-class classification [39], supplier selection [31], information fusion of water quality measurement sensors [40], etc. However, there have been few studies completed for soft sets-based decision making by combining Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence with grey relational analysis; in particular there has been no work completed for fuzzy soft sets-based decision making by rough set approaches. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore the fuzzy soft sets in decision making by combining grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, and this enables decision makers to take advantage of both methods’ merits and allows evaluation experts to deal with uncertainty and risk confidently. Moreover, this not only allows us to avoid the above problem of selecting the suitable level soft set to obtain choice values and score values but also helps to reduce the uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level.In this paper, we present an approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making by combining grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. Moreover, we also propose an illustrative example to interpret the basic principal and the application of this approach to fuzzy soft sets-based decision making. Finally, by comparing the newly proposed approach with the mean potentiality approach to fuzzy soft sets-based decision making, we show the effectiveness of the newly proposed approach.The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present some concepts about fuzzy soft sets and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. In Section 3, we recall the mean potentiality approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making. In Section 4, we apply grey relational analysis to determine the uncertain degree of each parameter, by which suitable Mass functions with respect to each parameter are constructed. In addition, we use a Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence combination to make the decision. Moreover, an example is employed to illustrate our approach. In Section 5, an application in medical diagnosis is given, and we compare our approach with the mean potentiality approach, which shows the feasibility of our approach. In Section 6, we conclude this paper and highlight the prospects for potential future development.Throughout this paper, U denotes an initial universe, E denotes the set of all possible parameters, and 2Udenotes the family of all subsets of U. We only consider the case in which U and E are both nonempty finite sets. In this section, we briefly recall some basic concepts about fuzzy soft sets, the measure of performance of a method and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence.Definition 2.1([1]) Let A⊆E. A pair (F, A) is called a soft set over U, if F is a mapping defined by F:A→2U.In other words, a soft set over U is a parameterized family of subsets of the universe U. For e∈A, F(e) may be considered as the set of e-approximate elements of (F, A).Definition 2.2([5]) Let IUbe the set of all fuzzy subsets of U. Let A⊆E. A pair (F, A) is called a fuzzy soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F:A→IU.It is easy to see that every soft set may be considered a fuzzy soft set [25]. Let x∈U and e∈A. F(e) is a fuzzy subset of U, and it is called a fuzzy value set of parameter e. If F(e) is a crisp subset of U, then (F, A) is degenerated to be the standard soft set. Let F(e)(x) denote the membership value that object x holds parameter e; then F(e) can be written as a fuzzy set such that F(e)={x/F(e)(x)∣x∈U}.Example 2.3Let U={h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6} and A={e1, e2, e3, e4}. Let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set over U, defined as followsF(e1)={h1/1,h2/1,h3/0.2,h4/0.3,h5/1,h6/0.5},F(e2)={h1/1,h2/0.1,h3/0.3,h4/0.2,h5/0.1,h6/1},F(e3)={h1/0.1,h2/0.4,h3/1,h4/1,h5/0,h6/0.1},F(e4)={h1/0.1,h2/0.3,h3/1,h4/1,h5/0,h6/0.9}.Then, (F, A) is described by the following Table 1.Definition 2.4Let ((F, A) and (G, B) be two fuzzy soft sets. Then, “(F, A) AND (G, B)” is a fuzzy soft set denoted by (F, A)∧(G, B) and is defined by (F, A)∧(G, B)=(H, A×B), whereH(α,β)=F(α)∩˜G(β)for α∈A and β∈B, where∩˜is the operation “fuzzy intersection” of two fuzzy sets.Definition 2.5([27]) The measure of performance of a method (M) that satisfies the optimality criteria to solve a fuzzy soft set in decision making is defined as followsϒM=1∑i=1n∑j=1,i≠jn|F(ei)(Op)−F(ej)(Op)|+∑i=1nF(ei)(Op),where n is the number of choice parameters and F(ei)(Op) is the membership value of the optimal object Opfor the choice parameter ei.Suppose there are two methods M1, M2 that satisfy the optimality criteria, and their measures of performance areϒM1andϒM2, respectively. IfϒM1>ϒM2, then M1 is better than M2. IfϒM1<ϒM2, then M2 is better than M1. IfϒM1=ϒM2, then the performance of the both methods are the same.Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a new important reasoning method under uncertainty. It has an advantage in dealing with subjective judgments and synthesizing uncertainty knowledge. Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence discusses a frame of discernment, denoted by Θ, which is a finite nonempty set of exhaustive hypotheses (or all possible outcomes of an event), denoted by {A1, A2, ⋯, An}. 2Θ denotes the set of all subsets of Θ. The independence of evidence does not hold in many cases, and people emphasize the independence of evidence in applications of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory. Thus, researchers assume the approximation independence of evidence in using Dempster–Shafer evidence theory.In this paper, we only consider that the sources of evidences are mutually exclusive (i.e., Ai∩Aj=∅ (i≠j)).Definition 2.6([35]) Let Θ be a frame of discernment. A basic probability assignment function (for a short Mass function) on Θ is defined by a mapping m:2Θ→[0, 1], m satisfiesm(∅)=0,∑A⊆Θm(A)=1.For any A⊆Θ, m(A) represents the belief measure that one is willing to commit exactly to A, given a certain item of evidence.Definition 2.7([35]) Let Θ be the frame of discernment and m:2Θ→[0, 1] be a Mass function on Θ. Then, a belief function on Θ is defined by a mapping Bel:2Θ→[0, 1], Bel satisfiesBel(∅)=0,Bel(Θ)=1,Bel(A)=∑B⊆Am(B)(A∈2Θ).Bel(A) represents the sum of the possibilities measurement of all subsets of A, namely, the total degree of support of A.In the case of the singleton element, Bel(A)=m(A).In reality, a decision maker can often gain access to more than one information source to make his/her decisions. Evidence theory constructs a set of hypotheses of known Mass function values from these information sources and then computes a new set of combined evidence. This construction rule is called Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion.Definition 2.8([35]) Let Θ be the frame of discernment. For evidence A1, A2, ⋯, Asand B1, B2, ⋯, Bt, the corresponding Mass functions are m1 and m2, respectively, on Θ. If∑Ai∩Bj=∅m1(Ai)m2(Bj)<1, Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion is as follows:m(A)=m1⊕m2(A)=11−K∑Ai∩Bj=Am1(Ai)m2(Bj),∀A⊆Θ,A≠∅,0,A=∅,whereK=∑Ai∩Bj=∅m1(Ai)m2(Bj).K is called the conflict factor and reflects the extent of the conflict between the forms of evidence. Coefficient11−Kis called a normalized factor, and its role is to avoid the probability of assigning non-0 to an empty set ∅ in the combination.It is very important to take this value into account for evaluating the quality of the combination: If K→1 or K=1, which is in the case of strong conflict, Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion may not make sense and may lead to questionable decisions.The synthesis of multiple forms of evidence can be promoted according to Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion:m1⊕m2⋯⊕mn(A)=11−K∑⋂i=1nAi=A,Ai⊆Θm1(A1)m2(A2)⋯mn(An),where A⊆Θ, A≠∅, andK=∑⋂i=1nAi=∅,Ai⊆Θm1(A1)m2(A2)⋯mn(An)<1.Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion can increase belief measures and reduce the uncertain degree of all the evidence to improve reliability.Example 2.9Let a frame of discernment be {A1, A2}. For two items of evidence A1 and A2, the corresponding Mass functions are m1 and m2, respectively, on Θ, given bym1(A1)=0.3,m1(A2)=0.4,m1(Θ)=0.3,m2(A1)=0.4,m2(A2)=0.3,m2(Θ)=0.3.Combining the two pieces of evidence by Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion leads to:m(A1)=m1⊕m2(A1)=m1(A1)m2(A1)+m1(A1)m2(Θ)+m1(Θ)m2(A1)1−K=0.44,m(A2)=m1⊕m2(A2)=m1(A2)m2(A2)+m1(A2)m2(Θ)+m1(Θ)m2(A2)1−K=0.44,m(Θ)=m1⊕m2(Θ)=m1(Θ)m2(Θ)1−K=0.12,where K=m1(A1)m2(A2)+m1(A2)m2(A1)=0.25.To cope with fuzzy soft sets-based decision-making problems, Feng et al. [25] noted Roy-Maji's [22] and Kong's [24] methods of limitation and applied level soft sets to discuss fuzzy soft sets-based decision making. Based on Feng’ works, Basu et al. [27] further investigated the previous methods for fuzzy soft sets in decision making and introduced the mean potentiality approach, which was demonstrated to be more efficient and more accurate than Feng’ method, the Analytical Hierarchy Process [41] and Bayes’ classification method [42]. Let U={x1, x2, ⋯, xm} be a finite universe set and A={e1, e2, ⋯, en} be a choice parameter set. Given a fuzzy soft set (F, A), F(ej)(xi) denotes the membership value that object xiholds parameter ej. ρ denotes the maximum number of significant figures among all the membership values of the objects concerned with (F, A). Next, we recall the mean potentiality approach to (F, A) based on a decision-making problem with equally weighted choice parameters:Step 1.Find a normal parameter reduction B of A. If it exists, we construct the tabular representation of (F, B). Otherwise, we construct the tabular representation of (F, A) with the choice values of each object.Compute the mean potentialitymp=∑i=1m∑j=1nF(ej)(xi)m×nup to ρ significant figures, denoted bymp′.Construct amp′-level soft set of (F, A) and represent it in tabular form, and then compute the choice value cifor each xi.Denote max {c1, c2, ⋯, cm}=ck. If ckis unique, then the optimal choice object is xk, and the process will be stopped. Otherwise, go to Step 5.Compute the non-negative difference between the largest and the smallest membership value in each column (resp. each row) and denote it as aj(j=1, 2, ⋯, n) (resp. βi(i=1, 2, ⋯, m)).Compute the averageα=∑j=1najnup to ρ significant figures, denoted by α′.Construct a α′-level soft set of (F, A) and represent it in tabular form; then compute the choice valueci′for each xi.Denote max{c1′,c2′,⋯,cm′}=cl′. Ifcl′is unique, then the optimal choice object is xl, and the process will be stopped. Otherwise, go to Step 9.Consider the object corresponding to the minimum value of βi(i=1, 2, ⋯, m) as the optimal choice of decision makers.Generally, the existing methods for fuzzy soft sets-based decision making problems are mainly based on different kinds of level soft sets. However, it is very difficult for decision makers to select a suitable level soft set in most soft sets based on decision making.Now, we give an approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence. This approach is effective and practical under uncertain conditions. It not only allows us to avoid the problem of selecting the suitable level soft set but also helps reduce uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level.Our approach includes three phases: First, grey relational analysis is applied to calculate the grey mean relational degree between each independent alternative and the mean of all alternatives with each parameter, and the uncertain degree of each parameter is obtained. Second, the suitable Mass function with respect to each parameter (or evidence) is constructed by the uncertain degree of each parameter. Third, we apply Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion to aggregate independent evidence into collective evidence, by which the candidate alternatives are ranked and the best alternative(s) are obtained.In the following, we consider a decision-making problem concerned with s mutually exclusive alternatives xiand n evaluation parameters (or indexes) ej. dijdenotes the membership value of xiwith ej. PutΘ={x1,x2,⋯,xs}andA={e1,e2,⋯,en}.Define F: A→IΘ by F(ej)(xi)=dij. Then, (F, A) is a fuzzy soft set over Θ andD=(dij)s×nis called the matrix induced by (F, A).By identifying uncertain and unknown evidence, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence captures more information to support decision making than probability theory. It provides a mechanism to derive solutions from various pieces of vague evidence without knowing much prior information. The primary problem is how to obtain the uncertain degree of the evidence. First, we present some basic notions.Definition 4.1([43]) Let Θ={x1, x2, ⋯, xs}, A={e1, e2, ⋯, en}, and let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set on Θ. Suppose thatD=(dij)s×nis the matrix induced by (F, A). For any i, j, denotedi˜=1n∑j=1ndij,▵dij=|dij−di˜|,rij=min1⩽i⩽s▵dij+ρmax1⩽i⩽s▵dij▵dij+ρmax1⩽i⩽s▵dij,whereρ∈(0,1),DOI(ej)=1s(∑i=1s(rij)q)1q(j=1,2,⋯,n).Then,(1)di˜is called the mean of all parameters with respect to xi,▵dijis called the difference information between dijanddi˜,ρ is called the distinguishing coefficient and rijis called the grey mean relational degree between dijanddi˜, andDOI(ej) is called the uncertain degree of the parameter ej.The distinguishing coefficient ρ is an important factor that affects the correlation analysis resolution and the value distribution of the grey mean relational degrees rij. The purpose of ρ is to weaken the Max value's affect when this value is so large that its purpose is lost and to improve the difference between the grey mean relational degrees rij. ρ and the correlation analysis resolution are inversely proportional, i.e., the smaller ρ is, the greater the correlation analysis resolution is; the greater ρ is, the smaller the correlation analysis resolution is. According to the experience, we pick ρ=0.5 to obtain strong distinguishing effectiveness, which can more accurately reflect the related degree between dijanddi˜.Moreover, to obtain strong distinguishing effectiveness, we use Euclidean distance rather than Hamming distance, namely q=2. It is worth noting that the method to obtain the uncertain degree in Definition 4.1 varies in different situations. If a parameter is in particular more matching with the mean of the parameter set than other parameters, the parameter contains more satisfying information for decision making, and the uncertain degree of the parameter with respect to alternatives is lower. Then, in this paper, we just consider the grey mean relational degree between dijanddi˜.Definition 4.2([44]) Let X=(x1, x2, ⋯, xs) be a finite difference information sequence, where there existsxik≠0for k=1, 2, ⋯, m and 1⩽ik⩽s. Then, the information structure image sequence Y=(y1, y2, ⋯, ys) is given byyi=xi∑i=1sxi.In a matrixD=(dij)s×nconcerned with s mutually exclusive alternatives xiand n evaluation parameters ej, where dijis the membership value of xiwith ej, the information structure image sequence with respect to ejis denoted bydj={d1j˜,d2j˜,d3j˜,⋯,dmj˜}, wheredij˜=dij∑i=1sdij.Then, we obtain an information structure image matrix by dj(j=1, 2, ⋯, n).Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a powerful method for combining accumulative evidence of changing prior opinions in the light of new evidence [35]. The primary procedure for combining the known evidence or information with other evidence is to construct suitable Mass functions of evidence. Obtaining the Mass function is flexible. People's experience, knowledge or thinking will affect the selection of the Mass function.Now, by the uncertain degree of each parameter, we can obtain the Mass function of each alternative with respect to each parameter.Theorem 4.3Let Θ={x1, x2, ⋯, xs}, A={e1, e2, ⋯, en}, and let (F, A) be a fuzzy soft set over Θ. Suppose thatD=(dij)s×nis the matrix induced by (F, A), where dijdenotes the membership value that the alternative xiholds the parameter ej. Denotedij˜=dij∑i=1sdij.We define functionsmej(j=1,2,⋯,n)with respect to the parameter ejit satisfies:m(A)=0(|A|≠1ands),mej({xi})=dij˜(1−DOI(ej))(i=1,2,⋯,s,j=1,2,⋯,n),mej(Θ)=1−∑i=1smej({xi})(j=1,2,⋯,n).Then,mej(j=1,2,⋯,n)are Mass functions on Θ.ProofFor eachj,∑A⊆Θmej(A)=1Thus,mejare Mass functions on Θ. □Denotemj(i)=mej({xi}),mj(Θ)=mej(Θ).mj(i) implies the belief measure of the alternative xiwith the parameter ej. mj(Θ) implies the belief measure of the whole uncertainty with respect to the parameter ej.Next, using Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion to compose m1, m2, ⋯, mnwith respect to each alternative xi, we obtain the belief measure of each alternative xi. Thus, we obtain the decision-making results.Based on the above analysis, given a fuzzy soft set (F, E) concerned with s mutually exclusive alternatives xiand n evaluation parameters ej, the decision procedure of the proposed approach for (F, E) can be summarized as follows: Step 1.

This implies that our approach of combining grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence can help reduce uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level.

This implies that our approach combining grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence can help reduce uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level. Moreover, judged by the measures of performance ϒ=4.6, our approach is as feasible and effective as the mean potentiality approach under uncertain information.One of the toughest challenges in medical diagnosis is handling uncertainty. Doctors detect clinical manifestations by comparison with predefined classes to find the most similar disease. Only one comprehensive result can be obtained from existing methods for medical diagnosis, which cannot provide the certainty or uncertainty of the result. Therefore, we do not know how to deal with the unknown factors in the process of medical diagnosis. In this section, we apply our approach to solve medical diagnosis problems. Now, we consider the medical diagnosis problem cited from Examples 6.2 in [27] by using our approach.Suppose that the universe U contains four diseases, given by U={acute dental abscess, migraine, acute sinusitis, peritonsillar abscess} ={d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4}(say). Suppose that the set of parameters E is given by E ={fever, runningnose, weakness, oro-facial pain, nausea vomiting, swelling, trismus, history, physical examination, laboratory investigation} ={e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5,e_6, e_7, s_1,s_2,s_3}(say).Let A, B be two subsets of E given by A={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} and B={s1, s2, s3}. Suppose that (F, A) and (G, B) are two fuzzy soft sets describing “symptoms of the diseases” and “decision-making tools of the diseases”, respectively. The tabular representations of (F, A) and (G, B) are given in Tables 11 and 12, respectively.Now, suppose that a patient who is suffering from a disease has four symptoms P (fever, runny nose, oro-facial pain). The key problem is how a doctor reaches the most suitable diagnosis according to the symptoms, history, physical examination and laboratory investigation of the patient. To solve this problem, we consider “(F, P) AND (G, B)”, given by Table 13. There are four diseases d1, d2, d3, d4 and nine pairs of parameters a1=(e1, s1), a2=(e1, s2), a3=(e1, s3), a4=(e2, s1), a5=(e2, s2), a6=(e2, s3), a7=(e4, s1), a8=(e4, s2), a9=(e4, s3), which is a pair of one symptom and one decision-making tool, respectively.Next, we will apply our approach to detect which disease is most suited to the symptoms and these investigative procedures. Then, in the decision making, we consider that the four diseases construct a frame of discernment, denoted by Θ={d1, d2, d3, d4}. We consider the nine pairs of parameters as a set of evidence, which contains a diagnosis parameter system denoted by Q={a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}.Step 1.We construct the matrix induced by “(F, P) AND (G, B)”, which completely presents the degree to which a patient is suffering from a disease diwith one symptom and one decision-making tool aj.D=(dij)4×9=0.60.60.40000.60.80.40.20.20.20000.80.30.60.30.30.30.70.40.70.80.40.70.40.40.30000.60.70.3Because ajin particular matches more the mean of the parameter set than other parameters, ajcontains the satisfying information for decision making and the uncertain degree of ajis low. Now, we consider the meandi˜of the parameter set with respect to di, calculated bydi˜=19∑j=19dijas follows:d1˜=0.3778,d2˜=0.2556,d3˜=0.5111,d4˜=0.3000.To obtain the grey mean relational degree, we need to calculate the difference information between dijanddi˜and construct the difference matrix as follows:▵D=0.22220.22220.02220.37780.37780.37780.22220.42220.02220.05560.05560.05560.25560.25560.25560.54440.04440.34440.21110.21110.21110.18890.11110.18890.28890.11110.18890.10000.10000.00000.30000.30000.30000.30000.40000.0000Based on the the difference matrix ▵D, the grey mean relational degree between dijanddi˜is calculated as follows:(rij)4×9=0.50000.50000.82610.66670.52940.66671.00000.40350.88571.00001.00000.65520.85000.67500.85000.60541.00000.33330.51720.51720.33331.00001.00001.00000.88120.79310.47690.78950.78951.00000.77270.61360.77270.86410.41821.0000To obtain Mass functions of diand Θ with respect to aj, now we need to calculate the uncertain degree of ajas follows:DOI(a1)=0.3658,DOI(a2)=0.3658,DOI(a3)=0.3727,DOI(a4)=0.4156,DOI(a5)=0.3634,DOI(a6)=0.4156,DOI(a7)=0.4250,DOI(a8)=0.3506,DOI(a9)=0.3643.We calculate the information structure image sequence with respect to ajand construct the matrix as follows:D˜=(dij˜)4×9=0.40000.40000.33330000.21430.36360.20000.13330.13330.16670000.28570.13640.30000.20000.20000.25001.00001.00001.00000.28570.18180.35000.26670.26670.25000000.21430.31820.1500We calculate Mass function values of diand Θ with respect to ajby Theorem 4.3 as follows:(mj(i))4×9=0.25370.25370.20910000.12320.23610.12710.08460.08460.10450000.16430.08860.19070.12680.12680.15680.58440.63660.58440.16430.11810.22250.16910.16910.15680000.12320.20660.0954andm1(Θ)=0.3658,m2(Θ)=0.3658,m3(Θ)=0.3727,m4(Θ)=0.4156,m5(Θ)=0.3634,m6(Θ)=0.4156,m7(Θ)=0.4250,m8(Θ)=0.3506,m9(Θ)=0.3643.The combination of parameters (or evidence) is used to provide the strongest evidence for the medical diagnosis problem. By Definition 2.8, we can obtain the following results:Bel({d1})=m({d1})=m(1)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(1)=0.0827,Bel({d2})=m({d2})=m(2)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(2)=0.0284,Bel({d3})=m({d3})=m(3)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(3)=0.8349,Bel({d4})=m({d4})=m(4)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(4)=0.0471.Then, the final rang order is d3≻d1≻d4≻d2.According to the maximum belief measure principle, the patient is suffering from acute sinusitis d3. This diagnosis result is consistent with the result in [27].Moreover,19∑j=19mj(Θ)=0.3821.Note thatm1(Θ)=0.3658,m2(Θ)=0.3658,m3(Θ)=0.3727,m4(Θ)=0.4156,m5(Θ)=0.3634,m6(Θ)=0.4156,m7(Θ)=0.4250,m8(Θ)=0.3506,m9(Θ)=0.3643.By Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion in Definition 2.8, we havem(Θ)=m1⊕m2⊕m3⋯⊕m9(Θ)=0.0069.By Definition 2.5, the measure of performance of our approach is ϒ=4.716.In summary, the results of this comparison study can be shown in Table 14.From above results, the belief measure of the whole uncertainty falls from the initial mean 0.3821 to 0.0069 after evidence fusion. This implies that this approach combining Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence with grey relational analysis reduces the uncertainty to a great extent and improves the accuracy and reliability of the medical diagnosis effectively. The measure of performance of our approach is the same as that of the mean potentiality approach [27], which indicates the rationality and applicability of our method. It is worth noting that the result from our approach also gives the second and the third possible disease, which is clearer than Basu's approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have introduced an approach to fuzzy soft sets in decision making by combining grey relational analysis with Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence and given a practical application to medical diagnosis problems. We first apply grey relational analysis to construct suitable Mass functions for each alternative and then use Dempster–Shafer rule of evidence fusion to compose this information, and the belief measure of the whole uncertainty is declined. In a sense, the approach can help reduce uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition so as to raise the choice decision level. Moreover, compared with the mean potentiality approach by the measure of performance method, our approach allows us to avoid this problem of selecting suitable level soft sets and is more feasible and practical for real-life applications under uncertainty. In addition, the approach sets up a decision-making model and thus broadens the application field of grey system theory. In future work, we will consider an approach to intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets in decision making based on grey relational analysis and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence application to decision making, study D-S generalized fuzzy soft sets, and explore how to effectively carry out the fusion of multi-source information in the case of highly conflicting evidence.
