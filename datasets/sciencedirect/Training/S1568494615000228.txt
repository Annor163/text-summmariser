@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a sensorless wind energy conversion system (WECS) maximum wind power point tracking using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy cerebellar model articulation control (T-S CMAC). The main objective of the WECS is to achieve maximum power transfer under various wind speeds without actual measurement of the wind velocity. We first represent the WECS, which uses a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), as a nonlinear dynamical model. To carry out the T-S CMAC design, we rewrite the WECS model as a T-S fuzzy representation. The T-S CMAC design is inspired by the architectural similarity of the T-S fuzzy control and CMAC where accordingly the PDC design control gains and weighting parameter are augmented into a single vector. The advantages of this approach are 3-fold: (i) increases accuracy of CMAC initial weights – we assign the initial weights of CMAC using the control gains solved by the LMIs from the PDC design; (ii) introduces adaptive ability in LMI-based design – the CMAC design allows time-varying parameters in the system; and (iii) relaxes assumption on system uncertainty – we drop the assumption that a strict upper bound on system uncertainty is known. Numerical simulations under various wind speeds show exponential convergence results which further verify the theoretical derivations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The goal for wind energy conversion systems (WECS) is to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under various wind conditions. From previous works, we can classify two approaches for maximum power tracking of WECS: (i) circuit and converter redesign based, where the work [1] uses a phase lock loop to track the rotor position; the work [2] uses a matrix converter circuit to adjust the induction generator terminal frequency; the work [3] uses a LCL-filter control for variable speed WECS; the work [4] uses a back-to-back IGBT frequency converter control permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) to adjust the maximum power point; and (ii) digital controller design based, where the work [5] uses a hill climb search algorithm for the maximum power point; and the work [6] uses only one-power-point; the work [7] uses a full scale converter for dynamic simulation of a directly driven wind generator by vector control and sliding mode control strategies; the work [8] uses PI controller and sliding mode observer for the maximum power point.In recent years, the T-S (Takagi–Sugeno) fuzzy controller has been widely applied to control problems [9–13]. The advantages of the T-S fuzzy approach are (i) systemic modeling and analysis approach – we can represent nonlinear systems into a linear subsystems where mature linear system tools are applicable; (ii) unification of multiple control objectives into LMIs (linear matrix inequalities) – we can simultaneously consider tracking, estimation, robustness, etc., and formulate objectives into LMIs; and (iii) numerical solution of control gains – powerful numerical software packages, such as Matlab LMI Toolbox, solve LMIs to obtain the controller gains. Although many of the aforementioned works address parametric uncertainty based on existence of a strict upper bound, few works focus on the time-varying parameter problem.On the other hand, the cerebellar model articulation control (CMAC) based approach has been widely used to address the time-varying parameter problem in the system. However, the initial weights in the CMAC are given using trial and error methods and results in degradation of transient controller performance.In light of the above, we propose T-S CMAC to achieve MPPT for WECS under various wind conditions without wind velocity measurement. We first represent the WECS, which uses a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), as a nonlinear dynamical model. To carry out the T-S CMAC design, we then rewrite the WECS model as a T-S fuzzy representation. The T-S CMAC design is inspired by the architectural similarity of the T-S fuzzy and CMAC where accordingly the PDC design control gains and CMAC weighting parameter can be augmented into a single vector. The advantages of this approach are 3-fold: (i) increases accuracy of CMAC initial weights – we assign the initial weights of CMAC using the control gains solved by the LMIs from the PDC design; (ii) introduces adaptive ability in LMI-based design – the CMAC design allows time-varying parameters in the system; and (iii) relaxes need of information of system uncertainty – we drop the assumption that a strict upper bound on system uncertainty is known.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section2, we describe the mathematical model of the WECS and the problem formulation. In Section3, we carry out the T-S CMAC output tracking control design and stability analysis. In Section4, we carry out numerical simulations for WECS using T-S CMAC under fixed and varying wind speed scenarios. Finally, some conclusions are made in Section5.We consider the WECS architecture shown in Fig. 1.From Fig. 1, the wind turbine system is linked to the DC bus directly. Assuming the converter is ideal, the load current can be referred to the DC side as an output variable current iL. Therefore, the current across the battery bankie=[(πiq2+id2uw)/(23)]−iL,where iLis measurable and known. The lead-acid battery bank may be modeled as a voltage source Ebconnected in series with a resistance Rband capacitance Cb[14,15]. The DC bus voltageVb=Eb+vc+(iw−iL)Rb,wherevcis the voltage of the capacitor. Neglecting the friction term, we then simplify the mechanical dynamic equation of wind turbine system(1)ω˙e=p(Tt−Te)2J,where J is the inertia of the rotating system and Ttis the turbine torque [15,16]. Note that for a given constant voltage in the PMSG terminals, there exists a minimum shaft speed below which the wind turbine system cannot generate power. This lower limit arises naturally from the analysis of the phasor diagram depicted in Fig. 2. It is not possible to build a PSMG for speed s that induces Efsmaller than Vs. Its expression is obtained in [17] through the steady state analysis of a similar topology, and can be written for the electrical angular speed asωeideal=Vs/ϕm.Then, the PMSG electrical torque can be written as:Te=Kt(ωe−ωeideal)=3pϕm24Rsωe−πVbuw33ϕmwhere the coefficient Ktis obtained by taking the derivative of the exact electrical torque equation with respect to the electrical speed, over the limit speed point(ωeideal)[18,19].In the following control design, we utilize a so-called virtual-desired-variable synthesis. This method is ideal for the output tracking control problem of complex nonlinear dynamical models such as WECS once we include an integrator previous to the real inputuw. Then, the input becomes a new state variable and the integrating signal is the new control input. Note that wide variations of control force would result in a significant ripple in the generated power of the wind turbine system. Therefore, the integration ofuwwill result in a smoother control signal which benefits the final controller implementation. As a result, the complete nonlinear dynamical model of the wind energy conversion system under the aforementioned considerations can be written as [14]:(2)i˙q=−RsLsiq−ωeid+ωeϕmLs−πVbiquw33LIs,i˙d=−RsLsid+ωeiq−πVbiduw33LIs,ω˙e=p2JTt−3pϕm2ωe4Rs+πpϕmVbuw43Rs,v˙c=1Cb(iw−iL),u˙w=u.with(3)Vb=Eb+vc+(iw−iL)Rb,Is=iq2+id2,iw=π23iq2+id2uw.According to the function (2) and (3) and which is derived from [20] and [21], we have uωas the control input from the known premise variable.Let x1=iq, x2=id, x3=ωe,x4=vc, andx5=uw. Then the WECS nonlinear model can be described as:(4)x˙(t)=A(x,t)x(t)+Bu(t)+ηA(x,t)=−RsL0ϕmL−x20−πVbx133LIs0−RsLx10−πVbx233LIs00pTt2Jx3−3p2ϕm28JRs0πp2ϕmVb83JRs0000πIs23Cb00000,B=[00001]T,η=000−iLCb0Twhere Is=iq2+id2. Moreover, the system outputy(t)=Pt(x)=(8K/p3)x33is simply the power extracted from the wind turbine.In addition to achieve zero steady-state regulation error, the integral-type controller is robust to ill-modeled uncertainty and exogenous disturbance. To this end, we introduce an additional state variable to account for the integral of output regulation error. Define the new state variable as(5)xe=∫(yd−y(t))dtTherefore the error dynamic equationx˙e=yd−y(t). For multi-output systems (m>1), the vector xedenotes a stack of m integrators. The main object of output tracking control is to satisfy y(t)−yd(t)→0 as t→∞, where yd(t) denotes the desired generated power. The WECS nonlinear model with uncertainty is as follows:(6)x˙(t)=[A(x)+ΔA(t)]x(t)+Bu(t)+η+Δη(t),where ΔA and Δη are accordingly the time-varying structured and unstructured uncertainties of the system; and input matrix can be represented in the following B=[0…0B0]Twith B0∈Rm×m.The T-S fuzzy representation of the nonlinear system (6) arePlant Rulei: IF z1(t) is F1iand … and zg(t) is FgiTHENx˙(t)=[Ai+ΔA(t)]x(t)+Bu(t)+η+Δη,i=1,2,…,rwhere z1(t)∼zg(t) are the premise variables which consist of the states of the systems; Fji(j=1, 2, …, g) are the fuzzy sets; r is the number of fuzzy rules; x∈Rnis the state vector; Ai, B, and η are the system matrices with appropriate dimensions. Using the singleton fuzzifier, product inferred, and weighted average defuzzifier, the nonlinear system can be expressed as follows:(7)x˙(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t))[Ai+ΔA(t)]x(t)+Bu(t)+η+Δηwhereμi(z(t))=ωi(z(t))/∑i=1rωi(z(t))withωi(z(t))=∏j=1gFji(zj(t)). Note that∑i=1rμi(z(t))=1for all t, where μi(z(t))≥0, for i=1, 2, …, r, are regarded as the grade function.To simplify the tracking controller design, we introduce a set of new variables xd=(x1d, x2d, …, xnd) which are to be tracked by state variables x(t). The output y(x(t)) will therefore track the desired output yd=y(xd(t)). Define the error(8)x˜(t)=x(t)−xd(t).Remark 1In contrast to traditional T-S fuzzy representations of structured and unstructured time-varying uncertainties, the need for a strict upper bound is relaxed.We first assume the ideal case where uncertainties ΔA, Δη are zero with appropriate dimensions. Taking the time derivative on (8), we have(9)x˜˙(t)=x˙(t)−x˙d(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aix(t)+Bu(t)+η−x˙d(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aix(t)−∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd(t)+∑i=1rμi(z(t))Bu(t)+∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd(t)+η−x˙d(t)Assume the control input(10)∑i=1rμi(z(t))Bu(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t))Bτ(t)−∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd(t)−η+x˙d(t).which renders the tracking error(11)x˜˙(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aix˜(t)+∑i=1rμi(z(t))Bτ(t).Note that the output tracking control is now transformed to a stabilization problem. The nominal fuzzy controller τ(t) is as followsControl Rulei: IF z1(t) is F1iand … and zg(t) is FgiTHENτ(t)=−Kix˜(t)with inferred output(12)τ(t)=−∑i=1rμi(z(t))Kix˜(t),where Kiare feedback gains. Substitute (12) into the regulation error (11), the closed-loop system(13)x˜˙(t)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμi(z(t))μj(z(t))(Ai−BKj)x˜(t)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμi(z(t))μj(z(t))Gijx˜(t)where Gij=Ai−BKj.The stability criterion for the close-loop system (13) is as follows.Theorem 2Let Mj=KjX, X=P−1, and D be a diagonal positive definite matrix. Suppose that the desired variables xdare well defined and bounded. The error system(13)is then exponentially stable via the fuzzy controller(12)with Kj=MjX−1if there exists a common positive definite matrix Xsuch that(14)ΓiiTP+PΓii+DPD<0,i=1,…,r(15)ΓijTP+PΓij<0,i<j≤rwhere Γii≡Gii, Γij≡(Gij+Gji)/2.ProofChoose the Lyapunov function candidate asV(x˜(t))=x˜T(t)Px˜(t), where the time derivativeV˙(x˜(t))=∑i=1rμi2(z){x˜T(t)(GiiTP+PGii)x˜(t)}+2∑i<j≤rμi(z)μj(z)x˜T(t)Gij+Gji2TP+PGij+Gji2x˜(t).According to (14) and (15), the time derivative becomesV˙(x˜(t))<−∑i=1rμi2x˜T(t)(DPD)x˜(t)≤−1rx˜T(t)(DPD)x˜(t),which further results inV(x˜(t))≤V(0)e−αtwithα=(λmin(DPD))/(rλmax(P)),where λmin(M) and λmax(M) accordingly denote the minimal and maximal eigenvalue of matrix M. Therefore, the error norm relationship∥x˜(t)∥2≤(V(0)/(rλmax(P)))e−αt. □Since we assume the desired variables and control input satisfy:(16)∑i=1rμi(z(t))B(u−τ)=x˙d−∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd−η,wherexd∈[xdmTxd(n−m)T]T. We then partition the matricesAixd=Ai11Ai12Ai21Ai22xdmxd(n−m).We therefore represent the input matrix(17)0m−−−−B0(u−τ)=x˙dm−Amxmxdm−ηm−−−−−−−−−−−x˙dn−m−Amxn−mxdn−m−ηn−m,which0n−m∈Rm,B(u−τ)∈Rn−m,xdm=[x1dx2d…xmd]T, andxdn−m=[x(n−m+1)dx(n−m+2)d⋯xnd]T. From the relationship (17), the systemx˙dm=Am(x)xdm+ηmwith nominal controller(18)un=τ+fI(x,xd),wherefI(x,xd)=B0−1(x˙dn−m−Amxn−mxdn−m−ηn−m).Remark 3We introduce the matrix D to enhance the decay rate of the tracking error. By carefully choosing D, we can improve the tracking response significantly. Then we apply Schur complement to (14) and utilize (15) appropriately to arrive with the LMIs(19)XAiT+AiX+XAjT+AjX−MjTBiT−BiMj−MiTBjT−BjMi<0XAiT+AiX−BiMj−MiTBjTXDTDX−X<0with X=P−1>0 and Mi=KiX. Solving the LMIs (19) yield Miand P−1. Finally, we arrive with controller gains Kifrom the relationship MiP=Ki.Now taking into considerations time-varying uncertainties (i.e., ΔA, Δη exist), we cannot derive the desired variables in the controller (18) from the relationship (17). To cope with this problem, we introduce control gains ΔKiand rewrite the controller(20)uc=τ+ucn(21)uc=0−∑i=1rμi(z)Ki1x˜+−K0−∑i=1rμi(z)ΔKi1x˜=∑i=1nRμi(s)zTvi(22)=∑i=1nRzTbi(s,mi,σi)vilwhere s=[s1s2…sj]Tare premise variables of the T-S fuzzy controller representation in (21) and corresponds to the input vector of the CMAC representation in (22);vi=[−K0−ΔK1…−ΔKnR]. We adopt a Gaussian receptive-field basis functionbi(s,m,σ)=∏i=1niϕi(si)=exp−∑i=1ni(si−mi)2σi2=μi(s)where bicorresponds with the ith receptive-field with means miand variances σi. Defineθ=[v1v2…vnR]∈Rni·nRandξ=[zTb1zTb2…zTbnR]∈Rni×nR. We therefore rewrite (22) into the optimal control input (in terms of CMAC approximation) uc=ξTθ. Assume θ* is an optimal parameter of θ, we arrive with optimal CMAC outputuc*=ξTθ*=uc+ɛwhere ɛ is a minimum reconstructing error. Therefore, the ideal control inputu*=fI(x,xd)+uc*. Define the actual overall control input(23)u=fI(x,xd)+uc+ucp,where ucpis a compensating controller. Therefore the control error function(24)u˜=u−u*=ξTθ˜+ucp+ɛwith parameter estimate error isθ˜=θ−θ*. According to the above function we can easily find out that (24) is the parameter of T-S CMAC, with the compensator(25)θˆ˙=−2rξ(PB)Tx˜(t)(26)ucp=−δˆ(PB)Tx˜(t)∥x˜T(t)PB∥,withδˆ˙=r2∥x˜T(t)C¯B∥. Therefore, by substituting (23) into (9), the closed-loop controller system(27)x˜˙(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t)){Aix˜(t)+B[fI(x,xd)+uc+ucp−τ]+η−x˙d(t)+∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd(t)+fI−fI}.We can then rewrite the system(28)x˜˙(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t)){Gix˜(t)+B[fI(x,xd)+uc+ucp]+η−x˙d(t)+∑i=1rμi(z(t))Aixd(t)+u*−u*},where Gi=(Ai−BKi). According tou*=uc*+fI(x,xd), we finally arrive with(29)x˜˙(t)=∑i=1rμi(z(t)){Gix˜(t)+B[fI(x,xd)+uc+ucp]}.In the following we derive the feedback gains Kiby formulating the stability conditions into LMI problems. Consider a Lyapunov–Krasovskii function candidate(30)V(x˜(t))=x˜T(t)Px˜(t)+12r1θ˜Tθ˜+12r2δ˜2,where P is a symmetric positive definite matrix with estimate error(31)δ˜=δˆ−δ.Thus, time derivative of (30) isV˙(x˜(t))=x˜˙T(t)Px˜(t)+x˜T(t)Px˜˙(t)+1r1θ˜Tθ˜˙+1r2δ˜Tδˆ˙=∑i=1rμi(z)x˜˙T(t)(GiTP+PGi)x˜(t)which can be inferred asV˙(x˜(t))≤2x˜T(t)PBξTθ˜+1r1θ˜Tθ˜˙+2x˜T(t)PB(uc+ɛ)+1r2δ˜Tδˆ˙≤2x˜T(t)PBξTθ˜+1r1θ˜Tθ˜˙+2x˜T(t)PBuc+2x˜T(t)PBɛ+1r2δ˜Tδˆ˙According to (25), we have2x˜T(t)PBξTθ˜+(1/r1)θ˜Tθ˜˙=0.

The reference input is implicitly represented as the desired variable xdin function fI. Then the generated output y(t) is defined as having components xi(i=1to5).Here, we apply the proposed controller to achieve optimal power generated by WECS. In the WECS model, the nonlinear terms are x1, x2,x12+x22=Is, Vband (Tt/x3) assumed to vary in the range defined as:max(x2)=D1,min(x2)=d1,max(x1)=D2,min(x1)=d2,max(Vb)=D3,min(Vb)=d3,max(Is)=D4,min(Is)=d4,max(Tt/x3)=D5,min(Tt/x3)=d5.where d1=−2, D1=30, d2=−1, D2=15, d3=5, D3=100, d4=1, D4=40, d5=0.001, and D5=2. Thus, the premise variables of the fuzzy system are z1=x2, z2=x1, z3=Vb, z4=Is, and z5=(Tt/x3). From the above, we arrive withF11(z1)=x2−d1D1−d1,F12(z1)=D1−x2D1−d1,F21(z2)=x1−d2D2−d2,F22(z2)=D2−x1D2−d2,F31(z3)=Vb−d3D3−d3,F32(z3)=D3−VbD3−d3,F41(z4)=Is−d4D4−d4,F42(z4)=D4−IsD4−d4,F51(z5)=(Tt/x3)−d5D5−d5,F52(z5)=D5−(Tt/x3)D5−d5.Therefore, we have the following relationshipsD1F11(z1)+d1F12(z1)=x2,F11(z1)+F12(z1)=1,D2F21(z2)+d2F22(z2)=x1,F21(z2)+F22(z2)=1,D3F31(z3)+d3F32(z3)=Vb,F31(z3)+F32(z3)=1,D4F41(z4)+d4F42(z4)=Is,F41(z4)+F42(z4)=1,D5F51(z5)+d5F52(z5)=Ttx3,F51(z5)+F52(z5)=1.The system matrices areAi=−RsL0ϕmL−ai10−πai2ai333Lai40−RsLai20−πai1ai333Lai400pai52Jx3−3p2ϕm28JRs0πp2ϕmai383JRs0000πai423Cb00000where ai=(ai1ai2ai3ai4ai5)i=1, 2, …, 32 are defined below:a1=(d1d2d3d4d5),,a2=(d1d2d3d4D5),a3=(d1d2d3D4d5),,a4=(d1d2d3D4D5),⋮⋮a31=(D1D2D3D4d5),,a32=(D1D2D3D4D5).In addition, BT=[00001], and ηT=[000(−iL/Cb)0].From the system matrices, and solving LMIs, we obtain the controller gains Ki(shown in details in Appendix A). Therefore the overall inferred output as:x˙(t)=∑i=132μi(z(t))(Aix+Bu)+η,u(t)=τ(t)+x˙5d,whereτ(t)=−∑i=132μi(z(t))Ki(x−xd). Then, we define the fuzzy set Fjifor the fuzzy-based controller by introducing an index function kj(i) to letFji=Fjkj(i)with [22]:k1(i)=i−116+1,k2(i)=i−18−2i−116+1,k3(i)=i−14−2i−18+1,k4(i)=i−12−2i−14+1,k5(i)=i−2i−12.where [.] denotes the floor function. Therefore, the corresponding membership functionsh1=F11F21F31F41F51,h2=F11F21F31F41F52,h3=F11F21F31F42F51,h4=F11F21F31F42F52,⋮⋮h31=F11F22F32F42F51,h32=F11F22F32F42F52.The system parameters are chosen [15] in Table 1. The controller is validated using two scenarios.Scenario 1: Fixed wind speedConsider the wind speed is fixed for a period of time at various values, as shown in Fig. 4. The output power varies for different speeds such as Fig. 5. The load current referred to the DC bus side (iL) is fixed at 57A. Responses of the power coefficient Cpand its reference value for WECS are shown in Fig. 6. Responses of electrical angular speed ωe, and its reference value shows in Figs. 7 and 8. The control outputUw, which is the input of DC–DC converter in different speed and control input u for WECS are separately shown in Figs. 9 and 10. And the output tracking error in different wind speed is shown in Fig. 11.Scenario 2: Varying wind speedConsider the wind speedvvaries between 8m/s and 11m/s shown in Fig. 12. The output power varies for different speeds, and the responses of the power coefficient Cpand its reference value for WECS are shown in Fig. 13. The load current referred to the dc bus side iLis between 3A and 5A. Responses of electrical angular speed ωe, and its reference value is shown in Fig. 14. The control outputUw, which is the input of DC–DC converter in different speed and control input u for WECS are separately shown in Fig. 15. Moreover, the tracking error in varying wind speed is shown in Fig. 16.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a T-S CMAC has been proposed to achieve output tracking for a WECS without knowledge of wind velocity. The combined controller has shown to have fast response by setting the initial conditions of the CMAC using solved LMI gains and adaptive ability in coping with time-varying parameters using CMAC. The satisfactory result of numerical simulations further reveals the validity of the proposed scheme. Regarding the disadvantages, compared to traditional control approaches (e.g., PID, sliding-mode, etc.), the computation complexity is large. However, this may be coped with by hardware implementation of the proposed controller. Therefore, the advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages.
