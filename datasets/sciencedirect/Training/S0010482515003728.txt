In vitro evaluation of basal shapes and offset values of artificial teeth for CAD/CAM complete dentures

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We evaluated optimal shape of artificial teeth for CAD/CAM complete dentures.We examined the optimal offset values required for teeth positioning.The structures in the basal areas showed accurate positioning for molars/premolars.The structures appeared to restrain motion during bonding.The optimal offset value was .20mm for molar and premolar teeth.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Statement of Problem. Artificial teeth are bonded onto the recesses of a milled denture base in a complete denture prepared using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Little is known, however, about the effects of basal shapes and offset values on the accuracy of positions of the bonded artificial teeth.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) technologies were applied to the field of complete denture prosthodontics [1,2]. Several fabrication methods for CAD/CAM fabricated complete dentures have been reported [3]. Among these methods, the laboratory procedures are subdivided broadly into 2 categories. One involves fabrication of denture bases using computerized-numerical-control milling [1,4], and the other is a hybrid of rapid prototyping (RP) and conventional laboratory procedures [5]. The abovementioned reports, however, described the fabrication methods and did not mention the accuracy of the finished dentures.The development of the system for fabricating CAD/CAM fabricated complete dentures was reported previously [6,7]. In this system, artificial teeth are bonded onto the recesses of a milled denture base. The authors previously reported that the polished surface of dentures shows high accuracy, whereas the occlusal surface shows low accuracy [8]. This is because artificial teeth are occasionally not returned to the specified positions during the bonding process, when there is no space between artificial teeth and the recesses. The authors also reported previously that in CAD/CAM fabricated complete dentures, recesses require an offset for precise positioning of teeth [9].However, in the abovementioned study [9], the displacement of bonded artificial teeth to the buccal surface was observed. This problem is because of the horizontal movement of artificial teeth during the bonding process. Furthermore, the study results showed a wide range of offset values of .10â€“.25mm and did not specify the optimal offset value. In addition, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used for analysis of bonded artificial teeth. In a previous report, Yamashina stated that CBCT is inaccurate [10].In order to solve these problems, in the present study, basal shapes of artificial teeth were developed from scratch; these shapes are intended to prevent the horizontal movement. Three offset values that were specified in a previous study were selected. A 3-dimensional (3D) laser scanner was used for accurate scanning of the prototype [11]. Thus, our null hypothesis was that, in this preliminary study, among 3 types of basal shape and 3 offset values, there are no differences in positioning of the artificial teeth.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Within the limitations of this preliminary study, both the offset values and the shapes of the basal area of artificial teeth can be optimized to improve the accuracy of positioning of artificial teeth in a CAD/CAM denture. The optimal offset values are .20mm for LL4 and LL6. The optimal basal shapes are Types 1 and 2 for LL4 and Type 2 for LL6.None declared.
