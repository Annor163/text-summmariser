@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Machine learning techniques can be used in diagnosis of breast cancer to help pathologists and physicians for decision making process. Kernel density estimation is a popular non-parametric method which can be applied for the estimation of data in many diverse applications. Selection of bandwidth and feature subset in kernel density estimator significantly influences the classification performance. In this paper, a PSO-KDE model is proposed that hybridize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and non-parametric kernel density estimation (KDE) based classifier to diagnosis of breast cancer. In the proposed model, particle swarm optimization is used to simultaneously determine the kernel bandwidth and select the feature subset in the kernel density estimation based classifier. Classification performance and the number of selected features are the criteria used to design the objective function of PSO-KDE. The performance of the PSO-KDE is examined on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) and Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer Database (WDBC) using classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has better average performance than GA-KDE model in diagnosis of breast cancer.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the whole world [1,2]. This cancer consists of erratic growth of cells in the breast tissue, forming tumors which can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) [2–4]. The correct and early detection of breast cancer can ensure a long survival of the patients [5]. The early detection of breast cancer requires an accurate and reliable diagnosis procedure that allows physicians to distinguish benign breast tumors from malignant ones [6,7]. Surgical biopsy can confirm benignity and malignancy of breast mass with high-level sensitivity. Nevertheless, surgical biopsy is a time-consuming and costly operation associated with a negative impact over the patient's psychology [5,8].One of the most common diagnostic tools for breast cancer without the negative aspects of surgical biopsy is a Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy (FNA) [9,10]. A breast FNA is a quick and simple procedure to perform in which some fluid or cells are removed from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore or swelling) by a fine needle and syringe. The sample of fluid or cells is smeared on a glass slide and evaluated under a microscope to determine the nature of the lump. An FNA biopsy allows the pathologist to determine the nature or diagnosis of the lesion [9,11,12]. The cytological characteristics extracted from FNA biopsy and machine learning techniques can be used for diagnosis of breast cancer. With the help of machine learning techniques, the possible errors made by the pathologists and physicians can be avoided, and the medical data can be examined in shorter time and more detailed [13]. In some applications, machine learning and classification techniques work properly if the probability densities of data are known. These densities are usually not available, and should be estimated [14]. Kernel density estimation is a non-parametric method which has been widely used for the estimation of data [15]. The quality of the kernel estimator is very much dependent on the choice of the kernel bandwidth. A series of techniques such as Rules of Thumb popularized by Silverman [16], Least Squares Cross-Validation [17,18], Biased Cross-Validation [19], Solve-the-Equation Plug-in Approach [20] and Smoothed Bootstrap [21,22] have been proposed for data-driven bandwidth selection.Besides the kernel bandwidth, the performance of kernel estimator depends on the appropriate selection of the most relevant features. A correct selection of the features can lead to improve the performance of estimator, either in terms of learning speed, generalization capacity or simplicity of the estimator [23]. There are three main categories for feature selection: filter, wrapper, and embedded methods [23–25]. Filter methods use statistical properties of the features to filter out poorly informative ones and select a subset of features independent of the classifier [24,25]. These methods do not inherit any bias of the learning algorithms and they are computationally efficient [26]. Wrapper methods use a learning algorithm to measure the quality of the subset of features and select the subset of features that provides the highest accuracy [27]. Embedded methods include feature selection as part of the training process without splitting the data into training and testing sets [28]. Feature selection is a challenging task because of the large search space and an exhaustive search is impossible in most situations. Most of the search algorithms applied to the feature selection suffer from the problems of stagnation in local optima or being computationally expensive. Therefore, the efficient global search techniques should be applied for feature selection problem. Evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have the global search ability. They have been used as an effective technique for solving the feature selection problem [29].Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary computation technique which is powerful and computationally efficient [30]. Recently, it has been successfully applied in large number of applications and difficult optimization problems [31–40]. Yeh et al. [31] proposed an approach using statistical method and discrete PSO for mining breast cancer pattern. Wang et al. [32] presented an integration of rough sets and particle swarm intelligence for the selection of high quality feature subsets. Xue et al. [29] proposed a PSO based feature selection approach and showed that PSO is an effective search technique for feature selection problem. Ouyang et al. [33] presented a hybrid particle swarm optimization to estimate the Muskingum model parameters. A combination of multi-objective PSO with pareto-optimal solutions was presented by Jia et al. [34] to solve the batch processes problem. Ouyang et al. [35] presented a parallel hybrid PSO (PHPSO) algorithm to solve a real case of one-dimensional heat conduction equation. Chen et al. [36] applied an improved cooperative PSO to train the feed forward neural network. The problem of cost optimization of mixed feeds was solved by particle swarm optimization [37]. Escalante et al. [38] proposed an application of PSO to the problem of full model selection (FMS) for classification.The aim of this paper is to propose a PSO-KDE model that hybridizes the particle swarm optimization and non-parametric kernel density estimation (KDE) based classifier to distinguish benign breast tumor from malignant one. Since the selection of kernel bandwidth and relevant features are the critical factors for the performance of kernel density estimation based classifier, particle swarm optimization is used to simultaneously determine the optimal kernel bandwidth and feature subset in the kernel density estimation based classifier. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) [41] and Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) [11,12] are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed PSO-KDE model. These datasets involve the measurements taken according to the fine needle aspirate test. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has a good performance compared with GA-KDE for diagnosis of breast cancer.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides related work on the feature selection and breast cancer diagnosis. Brief background knowledge on particle swarm optimization is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes non-parametric density estimation. Materials and methods are presented in Section 5. Results and discussion are presented in Section 6. Finally, conclusion and future work of paper is summarized in Section 7.
