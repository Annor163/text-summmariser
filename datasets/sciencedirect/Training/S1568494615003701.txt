@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Fuzzy C-means (FCM) partitions the observations partially into several clusters based on the principles of fuzzy theory. However, minimization on the Euclidean distance in FCM tends to detect hyper-spherical shaped clusters, which is unfeasible for the real world problems. In this paper, an effective FCM algorithm that adopts the symmetry similarity measure is proposed in order to search for the appropriate clusters, regardless of the geometric structures and overlapping characteristic. Experimental results on several artificial and real life datasets with different nature and the performance assessment with other existing clustering algorithms demonstrate its superiority.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Characterization and categorization of observations into different clusters are the most basic problem in data mining, with innumerable applications, that span from engineering, medical, bioinformatics to image processing disciplines. The action of grouping together the observations into dissimilar clusters with respect to a similarity measure is referred to as clustering, in such a way that the observations within the same cluster have a stronger degree of similarity than the observations in the different clusters. However, determining the degree of similarity and dissimilarity between the observations in the different clusters is always an opened question. There is no a priori method that should be the most favorable in all situations since the cluster analysis is problem-dependent, which is highly dependent on the varying essential attributes of the observations.As one of the most widely used clustering algorithm, fuzzy C-means (FCM) gains its high popularity due to its nature of simplicity and computationally easy-to-use. Nonetheless, one of the major difficulties encountered in the FCM is that the integration of Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity tends to identify the hyper-spherical shaped clusters of equal size, which is unfavorable and impracticable in the real world problems, especially the information of the geometric structures of the clusters is always a priori unknown. The clusters might be in different geometric shapes, such as compact hyper-spheres, compact hyper-ellipsoids, ring-shaped, lines and shells, and thus the FCM may not be able to find the proper partitioning.Several approaches have been developed in order to overcome such shortcoming in FCM. Ramathilagam and Huang replaced the Euclidean distance in FCM by an extended Gaussian kernel, which has more robustness to noise, as compared to FCM [1]. To account for the existence of non-spherical shaped clusters in magnetic resonance images (MRI), He et al. [2] adopted the distance measure as in the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm, where a positive definite, symmetric scatter matrix is used. Their proposed method greatly improved the deficiency of FCM that does not consider the non-spherical occupancy in the feature space. A Bayesian likelihood fitness function is incorporated in FCM by Han et al. [3], where its application to nonlinear channel blind equalization showed relatively high speed of convergence and substantial accuracy in estimating the channel output states. Kannan et al. [4,5] constructed an effective FCM by replacing the Euclidean distance with kernel-induced distance where the weighted bias field information is included. The implementation of the proposed algorithm on MRI achieved superior segmentation accuracy, as indicated by the Silhouette index. Apart from the kernel-induced distance, they extended their work in studying the robustness of FCM by substituting the Euclidean distance with hyper tangent function [6]. As well, Zhang and Chen [7] introduced a new kernel-induced metric in FCM; moreover, a spatial constraint has been added on the objective function of their proposed algorithm, which resulted in a noise-robust algorithm for medical image segmentation. A new distance metric on the basis of exponential function has been proposed and integrated in FCM by Wu and Yang [8], in order to compensate for the FCM inapplicability in a noisy environment. The non-Euclidean relational fuzzy clustering with β-spread transformation – the extension of FCM, has been developed by Hathaway and Bezdek [9]. Their proposed algorithm was versatile, in that its formal properties hold for; in addition, it can be implemented in a more computationally efficient manner, and was applicable to arbitrary dissimilarity data.If we noticed our surrounding carefully, it can be observed that the concept of symmetry and its workings exist in almost every single area in our daily life. A circle, a ladder or even snowflakes; all exhibit the characteristics of symmetry in nature. Moreover, symmetry is viewed as a highly important feature which is crucial for the recognition and reconstruction of shapes and objects [10]. As symmetry occurs both in nature and in human creations, based on the assumption that there are some sorts of symmetry which exist in the basic structure of clusters, a novel non-metric similarity measure, namely, the point symmetry distance (PSD), which is adopted in the K-means and FCM algorithms, was proposed [11,12]. Instead of assigning the observation to its closest cluster center, the resulted FCM with PSD, referred to as point symmetry-based Fuzzy C-means (PSDFCM) algorithm, designates the observation to a particular cluster from which it has the highest symmetrical sense with respect to that cluster center. In a nutshell, if two observations are symmetrical about a cluster center, these observations are said having symmetrical sense with respect to that cluster center. The PSDFCM is proven to give satisfactory clustering results when the clusters possess symmetrical intra-cluster attribute, i.e., the observations in that particular cluster are symmetrical to each other with respect to the cluster center. However, it has been noticed that the PSD metric suffers from the limitation of being unable to work efficiently when symmetrical inter-clusters exist, i.e., the two clusters are symmetrical to each other with respect to a third cluster center [10,13]. Bandyopadhyay and Saha [10] have pointed out that this is due to the fact that the PSD metric does not consider the Euclidean distance in determining the appropriate clusters. Subsequently, they revised the PSD, and developed a new point symmetry based distance (PS-distance) that incorporates the superiority from both the symmetry measure and Euclidean distance. The resulted genetic algorithm with point symmetry (GAPS), is able to detect both convex and non-convex clusters. The PS-distance is further coupled with other clustering techniques. In Ref. [14], the fuzzy variable string length genetic point symmetry (Fuzzy-VGAPS) algorithm is developed. Fuzzy-VGAPS, utilizing the PS-distance in its computation, is able to determine the number of clusters present in the dataset at the same time. It overcomes the limitations of FCM which requires a predefined value for the number of clusters and detects only the hyper-spherical shaped clusters. In Refs. [15–17], the PS-distance is integrated with multiobjective clustering techniques, such that the resulted approaches can concurrently optimize several validity measures that capture the different data characteristics, apart from the total symmetrical compactness.The idea of symmetry feature is also adopted by Chung and Lin [13] in a new similarity operator, specifically, the symmetry similarity level (SSL). The SSL operator considers the symmetrical sense of an observation to a particular cluster center from the aspects of distance difference and orientation angle. By integrating the SSL measure with the K-means algorithm, they showed that the developed algorithm works efficiently in detecting the symmetrical inter-clusters as well as the symmetrical intra-clusters, and achieves faster computation. In addition, the SSL operator also remedies the shortcomings of the previously proposed PSD measure, including the lack of closure property and distance difference symmetry property. Subsequently, they revised the SSL operator and combined it with the line symmetry property [18], such that the resulted algorithm does not only identify the clusters with inter- and intra-symmetry property efficiently, it also handles the clusters with line symmetry property well.The modified point symmetry-based fuzzy C-means algorithm (MPSFCM), integrating the SSL operator as the similarity measure in its computation, has been developed in our previous work [19], where its feasibility and efficiency has been validated in the heterogeneous cancer classification. However, scrutinizing the SSL operator in detail reveals that it violates the distance similarity property. It gives ambiguous solutions when computing the symmetry similarity for two different observations with respect to a particular cluster center. This might lead to an unsatisfactory clustering result. Thus, in order to remedy the shortcoming in the previous SSL operator, a modified symmetry similarity level (MSSL) operator is proposed. Subsequently, the MSSL operator is utilized as the similarity measure in our previous MPSFCM, and for convenience, the modified version of the MPSFCM is denoted as MSSLFCM. The validity and superiority of the MSSLFCM algorithm were then assessed quantitatively and qualitatively in clustering several simulated and real life datasets which possess different geometric structures and overlapping characteristics. In short, the proposed algorithm might be more favorable in the sense that:i.A novel and robust similarity measure for data clustering is integrated.It does not confine within the frame of detecting merely the hyper-spherical shaped clusters, as the proposed algorithm is generally applicable for any type of clusters, irrespective of their size, shape and convexity.It preserves the distance difference symmetry property.Better partitioning results can be achieved.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the limitation of the previous SSL operator is briefly reviewed in Section 2, followed by the description of the revised MSSLFCM algorithm in Section 3. In Section 4, the experimental simulations of the proposed MSSLFCM algorithm are provided and finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.A similarity metric, specifically, the PSD measure, that complements the limitation of Euclidean distance that favors in detecting spherical shaped clusters has been proposed by Su and Chou [11]. The PSD works in such a way that the observations are assigned to a cluster if they have a symmetrical sense with respect to the cluster center.If given a set of observations xi, i=1, …, N, and a cluster center c, in order to determine the degree of symmetry of an observation xiand observation xjwith respect to a cluster center ck, the PSD is defined as:(1)ds(xj,ck)=mini=1,…,Nandi≠j||(xj−ck)+(xi−ck)||||xj−ck||+||xi−ck||.The effectiveness of the PSD in detecting the symmetrical intra-clusters is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this figure, the original dataset consists of two symmetrical intra-clusters, C1 and C2, associated with the cluster center c1 and c2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The clustering result on the original dataset using the conventional FCM algorithm with Euclidean distance is portrayed in Fig. 1(b). It can be observed that, even though the observation x1 has the shorter distance with respect to the cluster center c1 if compared with the cluster center c2, institutively, it should be better to assign the observation x1 to cluster C2 from the symmetrical sense of data point distribution. Clustering results which are agreeable with human visual inspection can be obtained when the PSD is utilized in FCM algorithm. As demonstrated in Fig. 1(c), the PSDFCM algorithm was able to assign the observations into clusters C1 and C2 accurately, from the symmetrical point of view. It thus verified the efficiency of the PSD in handling the symmetrical intra-clusters.However, it has been pointed out that the PSD measure might encounter the possibilities of lacking the distance difference symmetry property and having deficiency in clustering the symmetrical inter-clusters [13]. Thus, a symmetry measure, specifically, the SSL operator was proposed in order to overcome the aforementioned limitations in PSD measure. To find the most symmetrical observation xjfor observation xiwith respect to a cluster center ck, the SSL operator is defined as:(2)SSL(xi,ck,xj)=maxxj∈CkDSL2(xi,ck,xj)+OSL2(xi,ck,xj)2,where the distance similarity level (DSL) and the orientation similarity level (OSL) are defined as:(3)DSL(xi,ck,xj)=1−|di−dj|diif0≤djdi≤20otherwise,wheredi=xick¯anddj=xjck¯,and(4)OSL(xi,ck,xj)=vi⋅vj2||vi||||vj||+0.5wherevi=xick→andvj=ckxj→,respectively.di=xick¯anddj=xjck¯represent the Euclidean norm difference between pattern xito cluster center ck, and Euclidean norm difference between pattern xjto cluster center ck, respectively. As observed from Eq. (2), restriction is imposed on the SSL operator in such a way that the candidate of the symmetrical observation xjis constrained to belong to the cluster center ckwhen computing SSL in order to affirm that the closure property is not violated.The SSL operator has been integrated with the classical FCM algorithm in our previous work [19]. The competence of the resulted MPSFCM algorithm in clustering both of the symmetrical inter-clusters and symmetrical intra-clusters is demonstrated in Fig. 2(c). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the simulated dataset contains three compact circles, which are separated clearly. When applying the PSDFCM algorithm on this dataset, it can be observed in Fig. 2(b) that PSDFCM fails to assign the observations into three distinct compact circles correctly. As opposed to the PSDFCM, the MPSFCM algorithm works well in detecting those three compact circles accurately without any misclassification.However, examining the Eq. (3) reveals that the DSL operator might not be able to preserve the distance similarity property between the observations. The distance difference between any two observations is certainly unchanged in anyway. In this regard, the DSL operator that indicates the distance difference for observation xjand observation xiwith respect to the cluster center ckshould be unaltered as well. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the distance difference between the observation xjand xirelative to ckdoes not remain constant, since we have:DSL(xi,ck,xj)=1−|4−5|4=0.75butDSL(xj,ck,xi)=1−|5−4|5=0.8.Therefore, in order to preserve the symmetry property in terms of distance difference, the modified DSL (MDSL) operator is now revised as:(5)MDSL(xi,ck,xj)=1.5−21+exp(−|di−dj|).and based on the scalar projection concept, the modified OSL (MOSL) operator is defined as:(6)MOSL(xi,ck,xj)=vi⋅vj2||vi||||vj||.Proposition 1It is true that −0.5<MDSL(xi,ck,xj)≤0.5.We consider the three extreme cases for di−dj=0, di−dj→+∞ and, di−dj→−∞.When di−dj=0, based on Eq. (5), we have:MDSL(xi,ck,xj)=1.5−21+exp(−0)=0.5When di−dj→±∞, exp(−|di−dj|)→0. Based on Eq. (5), we have:MDSL(xi,ck,xj)→1.5−21+0=−0.5Thus, the Proposition 1 is proven. ■From Eq. (5), it can be inferred that when di=dj, the MDSL=0.5, and thus it implies that the distancexick¯and distancexjck¯achieve the highest MDSL value. In fact, it can be concluded that the distance difference betweenxick¯andxjck¯is said to be inversely proportional with the MDSL, i.e., the larger the value of MDSL, the smaller the difference between the distancexick¯and distancexjck¯.Referring to Fig. 3 again, the MDSL operator is able to preserve the distance difference symmetry property, since we have:MDSL(xj,ck,xi)=1.5−21+exp(−|1|)=0.04.andMDSL(xi,ck,xj)=1.5−21+exp(−|−1|)=0.04Proposition 2It is true that −0.5<MOSL(xi,ck,xj)≤0.5.Based on the scalar projection, we havecosθ=vi⋅vj/(||vi||||vj||).Since −1≤cosθ≤1, it is obviously that−0.5≤(vi⋅vj/(2||vi||||vj||))≤0.5.The Proposition 2 is proven. ■Combining the MDSL and MOSL operators in Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), if given a set of observations xi, i=1, …, N, and a cluster center ck, in order to determine the degree of symmetry of an observation xiand observation xjwith respect to a cluster center ck, the proposed modified symmetry similarity level (MSSL) operator is now defined as:(7)MSSL(xi,ck,xj)=max1≤j≤N,xj∈CkMDSL(xi,ck,xj)+MOSL(xi,ck,xj)2,where it can be deduced easily that −0.5<MSSL(xi, ck, xj)≤0.5 is held. In short, the observation xjis said to be the most symmetrical observation for observation xirelative to cluster center ckif it achieved the highest value of MSSL among all the considered observations.Besides from preserving the distance difference symmetry property, as opposed to the PSD measure, the effectiveness of the proposed MSSL operator in handling both the symmetrical inter-clusters and symmetrical intra-clusters can be shown from the example in Fig. 4. In this figure, there are three symmetrical intra-clusters C1, C2 and C3, with cluster centers c1, c2 and c3, respectively. Let c1=(−5,5), c2=(0,0), c3=(5,−5), x1=(−4,6), x2=(−7,3), x3=(4,−3) and x4=(7,−7) respectively. To assign the observation x1 to its respective cluster, according to the PSD measure in Eq. (1), we have:ds(x1,c1)=||(x1−c1)+(x2−c1)||||x1−c1||+||x2−c1||=22+8=0.33,ds(x1,c2)=||(x1−c2)+(x3−c2)||||x1−c2||+||x3−c2||=952+25=0.26,ds(x1,c3)=||(x1−c3)+(x4−c3)||||x1−c3||+||x4−c3||=130202+8=0.67.Since ds(x1,c2)<ds(x1,c1)<ds(x1,c3), the observation x1 will be assigned to cluster C2, which is not agreeable with visual inspection. From the symmetrical point of view, instead of cluster C2, it would be better to assign the observation x1 to cluster C1. Next, in order to assign the observation x1 to its respective cluster, making use of the proposed MSSL operator in Eq. (7), we now obtain:MSSL(x1,c1)=MDSL(x1,c1,x2)+MOSL(x1,c1,x2)2=−0.1089+0.52=0.20,MSSL(x1,c2)=MDSL(x1,c2,x3)+MOSL(x1,c2,x3)2=−0.0.3025+0.47152=0.08,MSSL(x1,c3)=MDSL(x1,c3,x4)+MOSL(x1,c3,x4)2=−0.5+0.49752=−0.0012.Since MSSL(x1,c1) has the largest MSSL value among all the concerned observations, x1 will be assigned to cluster C1, which is more reasonable from the symmetrical sense of data point distribution.Inspired by the efficiency of the revised MSSL operator, the proposed modified symmetry similarity level fuzzy C-means (MSSLFCM) algorithm that compensates the shortcomings in the conventional FCM algorithm is presented in this section.Presenting a set of observations xi, where i=1, …, N, by borrowing the strength of the MSSL operator, the steps involved in the computation of the proposed MSSLFCM are presented in Algorithm 1.Algorithm 1The proposed MSSLFCM algorithm.beginInitialize the number of cluster centers, KInitialize the membership matrix uijrandomly, whereuij∈[0,1],∑i=1Kuij=1,∀j=1,…,Nwhile (iter<MaxGeneration) or (stopping criterion)(Coarse-Tuning)Update the K cluster centers using the conventional FCM algorithmend whilewhile (iter<MaxGeneration) or (stopping criterion)for all xido(Fine-Tuning)Compute the MDSL(xi, ck, xj) and MOSL(xi, ck, xj)if (MOSL(xi, ck, xj)≥β) and (0≤di−dj|<2) thenForm the set Sbikof all candidate symmetrical observations xjfor each xiCompute the MSSL(xi, ck, xj)if (MSSL(xi, ck*, xj) is the largest) and (xj∈Sbik) thenAssign xito cluster center ck*elseAssign xito cluster center ck** with the shortest Euclidean distanceend ifend ifif (MSSL(xi, ck*)>θ∈[0, 1]) thenUpdate the membership function uijwithuij=uij=1,ifj=kuij=0,ifj≠kelseUpdate the membership matrix uijwithuij=1∑k=1c(dji/dki)2/(m−1)end ifUpdate the new cluster center for K clusters bycknew=∑i=1nujimxi∑i=1nujimend forend whileendDuring the fine-tuning process, the threshold value 0.47 was imposed on MOSL(xi, ck, xj). This constraint was made on the assumption that the tolerance rate of the angle of orientation is less than 20° (The graphical illustration of the angle of orientation, θ is depicted in Fig. 3). This assumption is considered reasonable, since if the angle of orientation is more than the threshold values, the observation xjis no longer considered as symmetrical with the observation xi. It followed from Eq. (6) that:β=vi⋅vj2||vi||||vj||=||vi||||vj||cosθ2||vi||||vj||=cosθ2=cos20°2=0.47.We also impose the constraint of 0≤|di−dj|<k (k=2 in this case) on MDSL operator based on the assumption that the observation xjis no longer considered as symmetrical to the observation xiif their distance difference is greater than 2. If k≥2, the total time complexity will increase, since the number of the potential symmetrical observations to be considered will increase.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an effective FCM algorithm that applies the proposed MSSL operator, i.e., the MSSLFCM algorithm, in measuring the similarity between the observations and the respective cluster center based on the concept of symmetry is developed. The obtained results reveal the beneficial potential of MSSLFCM, since it can be observed that the proposed algorithm provides reasonable clustering results quantitatively and qualitatively for an extensive range of artificial and real life datasets, regardless of their possessed geometrical structures and overlapping characteristics.Although the proposed MSSLFCM algorithm demonstrates its good adaptability and superior applicability, much alteration need to be further improved. The computation of MSSLFCM algorithm is onerous. For each observation xi, the MSSL operator is measured for each of the remaining observation xj, with respect to each of the cluster center ck. Thus, some additional criteria are highly sought after to impose on the computation of the MSSLFCM algorithm for the purpose of speeding-up. The selection for the initial cluster centers is always an open question. Similar to the conventional FCM algorithm, the proposed MSSLFCM algorithm is sensitive to the initialization. An improper initialization of membership function will lead to local optimal solution. Thus, using the optimal solutions of the ant colony algorithm as the initial membership function of the MSSLFCM algorithm that would probably increase its search efficiency might be an interesting topic to be pursued.
