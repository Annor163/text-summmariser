@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An efficient and reliable stress computation algorithm is presented, which is based on implicit integration of the local evolution equations of multiplicative finite-strain plasticity/viscoplasticity. The algorithm is illustrated by an example involving a combined nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening; numerous backstress tensors are employed for a better description of the material behavior.The considered material model exhibits the so-called weak invariance under arbitrary isochoric changes of the reference configuration, and the presented algorithm retains this useful property. Even more: the weak invariance serves as a guide in constructing this algorithm. The constraint of inelastic incompressibility is exactly preserved as well. The proposed method is first-order accurate.Concerning the accuracy of the stress computation, the new algorithm is comparable to the Euler Backward method with a subsequent correction of incompressibility (EBMSC) and the classical exponential method (EM). Regarding the computational efficiency, the new algorithm is superior to the EBMSC and EM. Some accuracy tests are presented using parameters of the aluminum alloy 5754-O and the 42CrMo4 steel. FEM solutions of two boundary value problems using MSC.MARC are presented to show the correctness of the numerical implementation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In many practical applications, metal forming simulations are implemented to estimate the induced plastic anisotropy, the residual stresses and the magnitude of spring back. It is known that the numerical computations accounting for these effects should employ constitutive models of finite strain plasticity/viscoplasticity with combined nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening  [1–3]. One of such models was proposed by Shutov and Kreißig within the phenomenological context of multiplicative plasticity  [4]. An important constitutive assumption of this model is the nested multiplicative split of the deformation gradient: Within the first split, which is a classical one (cf.  [5,6]), the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and inelastic parts. Within the further splits, which were introduced by Lion in  [7] to account for a nonlinear kinematic hardening, the inelastic part is decomposed into conservative (energetic) and dissipative parts.Although there is a big number of approaches to finite strain elasto-plasticity  [8], the approach based on the multiplicative split is gaining considerable popularity in the modeling community. This is due to numerous advantages of the approach: Utilizing the multiplicative split, one may build a model which is thermodynamically consistent, objective, does not exhibit any non-physical energy dissipation in the elastic range and shear oscillation under simple shear. Moreover, the multiplicative split is considered to be the most suitable framework for the elastoplastic analysis of single crystals  [9].11Aside from materials with a crystalline structure, the multiplicative split advocated in this paper yields good results even for rubber-like materials  [10] and geomaterials  [11].Furthermore, the classical small strain models of metal plasticity exhibit the so-called weak invariance of the solution  [12]. The use of the multiplicative split allows one to retain this weak invariance property during generalization to finite strains  [12].Apart from the modeling of nonlinear kinematic hardening, the extensions of the Shutov and Kreißig model are used in analysis of nonlinear distortional hardening  [13], thermoplasticity  [14], ductile damage  [15], and ratcheting  [16]. Moreover, the model of Shutov and Kreißig was coupled with a microscopic model to account for the evolution of metal microstructure in  [17]. Due to the manifold applications of this model, its numerical treatment becomes an important task. The main goal of the current paper is to report a new efficient and robust stress integration algorithm, which benefits from the special structure of the governing equations.A similar phenomenological model with a nested multiplicative split was presented in  [18] by Vladimirov et al. This model was applied to many practical problems (see, among others,  [19–21]). Moreover, the idea of the nested multiplicative split was also adopted by other scholars to nonlinear kinematic hardening in  [22–25] and to shape memory alloys in  [26–28,21]. Due to the similarity of the modeling assumptions, the algorithm proposed in the current study can be applied to these constitutive equations as well.For the implementation in a displacement-based FEM, a numerical algorithm is needed which computes the stresses at each point of Gauß integration as a function of the local deformation history  [29]. For the model of Shutov and Kreißig (and its further extensions), the stress computation is based on the integration of the underlying constitutive equations. As usual for elasto-plasticity of metals, the corresponding system of constitutive equations is stiff. Thus, in general, an explicit time integration yields unacceptable results,22For the discussion of various explicit and semi-explicit integrators, the reader is referred to  [30] and references cited therein.and implicit time stepping is required to obtain a stable integration procedure. In the current study, the preference is given to the Euler Backward discretization of the evolution equations  [29,31]. Alternatively, one may consider its modification based on the exponential mapping [32–34]. A special class of time-stepping algorithms is obtained by the minimization of the integrated stress power. Such a variational approach is rather general so it can be applied to various models with nonlinear kinematic hardening  [35].As a result of the implicit time discretization, a system of nonlinear algebraic equations is obtained. Unfortunately, in general, the closed-form solution for this system is not available. Therefore, a time-consuming local iterative procedure has to be implemented to solve this system of equations  [36,18,28,20,21]. In some cases, the overall system of algebraic equations can be reduced to the solution of a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown. Such “one-equation integrators” are already available for many models of elastoplasticity with nonlinear kinematic hardening: An efficient stress algorithm was constructed for a model which is based on the assumption of small elastic strains in  [37]. In  [38], another anisotropic plasticity model is analyzed, which is based on the additive decomposition of the linearized Green strain. The authors benefit from the simple structure of the model, which resembles the infinitesimal elasto-plasticity. In  [39], a problem-adapted algorithm was proposed for a model of hypoelasto-plasticity with the additive decomposition of the strain rate. Next, a structure-exploiting scheme for a model with nonlinear kinematic hardening was recently proposed in [40] in the small-strain context. In  [41], an anisotropic model is considered employing logarithmic (Hencky) strain measures and quadratic stored energy functions. These assumptions simplify the algorithmic treatment, since an implicit integration by exponential mapping can be carried out using small strain procedures.At the same time, less progress has been achieved in the area of multiplicative elasto-plasticity or multiplicative viscoelasticity coupled to hyperelasticity. Due to the nonlinear kinematics, an efficient time-stepping becomes non-trivial even in the isotropic case. The construction of problem-adapted integrators is still a topic of ongoing research: An explicit update formula was proposed in  [42] for the special case of neo-Hookean free energy. Its generalization to elasto-plastic material with Yeoh elasticity is discussed in  [43]; an application to a temperature-dependent constitutive behavior is presented in  [44]. A semi-implicit scheme was proposed in  [25] for a model with nonlinear kinematic hardening implementing the Lion approach. This scheme is constructed assuming that the elastic strains are always coaxial with the plastic strain increment,33This coaxiality is discussed after Eq. 12.11 in  [25].which is a very restrictive assumption in case of plastic anisotropy. Moreover, in order to simplify the algorithmic treatment, the authors assume in  [25] that the plastic strain increments are small. Another hybrid explicit/implicit procedure was proposed in  [45], which is more robust than a purely explicit procedure.In this paper, the overall system of equations is subdivided (partitioned) into coupled subsystems. For each of the subsystems, simple closed-form solutions are obtained. An efficient time stepping procedure for the fully coupled system of algebraic equations is then constructed by a tailored combination of these explicit solutions. As a result, a new algorithm is obtained, which is called partitioned Euler Backward method (PEBM). Within PEBM, only a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown inelastic strain increment has to be solved iteratively.In the current paper, the accuracy of the stress computation by the proposed PEBM is tested numerically using material parameters of 5754-O aluminum alloy and 42CrMo4 steel. Concerning the accuracy, the new algorithm is comparable to the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction of incompressibility (EBMSC) and the classical exponential method (EM). The novel PEBM is superior to the conventional EBMSC and EM concerning the computational efficiency: For a model withNbackstress tensors, the EBMSC and EM require a solution of6N+7nonlinear scalar equations at each Gauß point. At the same time, the PEBM requires a solution of a scalar equation with respect to a single unknown inelastic strain increment. In particular, the introduction of additional backstresses is possible almost without any increase in computational costs.We close this introduction with a few words regarding notation. Throughout this paper, bold-faced symbols denote first- and second-rank tensors inR3. A coordinate-free tensor formalism is used in this work;1stands for the second-rank identity tensor; the deviatoric part of a tensor is denoted byAD≔A−13tr(A)1, wheretr(A)stands for the trace. The overline(⋅)¯stands for the unimodular part of a tensor(1)A¯=(detA)−1/3A.In description of algorithms, the notationA←Bmeans a computation step where the variableAobtains the new valueB.First, we recall the viscoplastic material model proposed by Shutov and Kreißig in  [4]. Here we consider its modification with two Armstrong–Frederick backstresses (cf.  [46]). A generalization of the algorithm to cover an arbitrary number of backstresses is straightforward. For simplicity of the numerical implementation, we adopt the Lagrangian (material) formulation of the constitutive equations.44An alternative derivation of the model is presented in  [47].The description of finite strain kinematics is based on the original work of Lion  [7]. Along with the well-known right Cauchy–Green tensorC, we introduce tensor-valued internal variables: the inelastic right Cauchy–Green tensorCiand two inelastic right Cauchy–Green tensors of substructure:C1iandC2i. In order to capture the isotropic hardening we will need the inelastic arc length (Odqvist parameter)sand its dissipative partsd.For the free energy per unit mass we assume the additive decomposition as follows(2)ψ=ψel(CCi−1)+ψkin 1(CiC1i−1)+ψkin 2(CiC2i−1)+ψiso(s−sd).Here,ψelstands for the energy storage due to macroscopic elastic deformations,ψkin 1andψkin 2represent two different storage mechanisms associated to the kinematic hardening, andψisois the energy storage related to the isotropic hardening.55Some additional energy-storage terms, which are not related to any hardening mechanism, can be added to the right-hand side of (2). Such terms can play an important role in thermoplasticity  [14].The functionsψel,ψkin 1andψkin 2are assumed to be isotropic. LetT̃andX̃denote respectively the 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor and the total backstress tensor operating on the reference configuration. The backstress describes the translation of the yield surface in the stress space, and it will be decomposed into two partial backstressesX̃1andX̃2. The isotropic expansion of the yield surface is captured by the scalar quantityR. The rate-dependent overstressfis introduced to account for the viscous effects.In order to formulate the system of constitutive equations, consider a local initial value problem. The local deformation historyC(t)is assumed to be known in the time intervalt∈[0,T]. The corresponding stress response is governed by the following system of ordinary differential and algebraic equations(3)Ċi=2λiF(CT̃−CiX̃)DCi,Ci|t=0=Ci0,detCi0=1,Ci0=(Ci0)T>0,(4)Ċ1i=2λiϰ1(CiX1̃)DC1i,C1i|t=0=C1i0,detC1i0=1,C1i0=(C1i0)T>0,(5)Ċ2i=2λiϰ2(CiX2̃)DC2i,C2i|t=0=C2i0,detC2i0=1,C2i0=(C2i0)T>0,(6)ṡ=23λi,ṡd=βγṡR,s|t=0=s0,sd|t=0=sd0,(7)T̃=2ρR∂ψel(CCi−1)∂C|Ci=const,X̃=X̃1+X̃2,(8)X̃1=2ρR∂ψkin 1(CiC1i−1)∂Ci|C1i=const,X̃2=2ρR∂ψkin 2(CiC2i−1)∂Ci|C2i=const,(9)R=ρR∂ψiso(s−sd)∂s,(10)λi=1η〈1f0f〉m,f=F−23[K+R],F=tr[(CT̃−CiX̃)D]2.Here,ρR>0,ϰ1≥0,ϰ2≥0,β≥0,γ∈R,η≥0,m≥1,K>0are constant material parameters, the real-valued constitutive functionsψel,ψkin 1,ψkin 2,ψisoare assumed to be known. The constantf0=1MPais adopted to obtain a non-dimensional term in the bracket; thus,f0is not a material parameter. The symbolλi(t)stands for the inelastic multiplier;F(t)denotes the norm of the driving force; the superposed dot denotes the material time derivative:ddtA=Ȧ;(⋅)Dis the deviatoric part of a second-rank tensor;〈x〉≔max(x,0)is the Macaulay bracket.Forψisowe assume(11)ρRψiso(s−sd)=γ2(s−sd)2,which yields(12)R=γ(s−sd).Note that this restrictive assumption forψisois not essential for the efficient time stepping scheme, which will be presented in the following. For the remaining part of the energy storage we adopt potentials of compressible neo-Hookean material(13)ρRψel(CCi−1)=k50((detCCi−1)5/2+(detCCi−1)−5/2−2)+μ2(trCCi−1¯−3),(14)ρRψkin 1(CiCi1−1)=c14(trCiC1i−1¯−3),ρRψkin 2(CiC2i−1)=c14(trCiC2i−1¯−3),wherek>0,μ>0,c1>0, andc2>0are material parameters.Remark 1The volumetric part of the strain energy function (13) was proposed by Hartmann and Neff in  [48]. It has an important advantage over many alternatives since it provides a convex function ofdetF. Moreover, the energy and the hydrostatic stress component tend to infinity asdetF→0ordetF→∞. Thus, ansatz (13) predicts a physically reasonable volumetric stress response even for finite elastic volume changes. Note that the algorithm, presented in the current study, can be applied irrespective of the specific choice of the volumetric strain energy function. □The material model is thermodynamically consistent.66The thermodynamic consistency of the model was proved in  [4] for the special case of only one backstress. This proof can be easily generalized to cover numerous backstress tensors.It combines the nonlinear hardening of Armstrong–Frederick type and the isotropic hardening of Voce type. The exact solution of (3)–(10) exhibits the following geometric property(19)Ci,C1i,C2i∈M,whereM≔{B∈Sym:detB=1}.Thus, (3)–(10) is a system of differential and algebraic equations on the manifold. The restrictiondet(Ci)=1corresponds to the incompressibility of the inelastic flow, typically assumed for metals; the conditionsdet(C1i)=1anddet(C2i)=1reflect the incompressibility on the substructural level, which is a modeling assumption. As was shown in  [49], these incompressibility conditions should be exactly satisfied by the numerical algorithm in order to suppress the accumulation of the integration error. Another important restriction is as follows: For the exact solution, the tensor-valued variablesCi,C1iandC2iare positive definite. Also from the physical standpoint, these quantities must remain positive definite, since they represent some inelastic metric tensors of Cauchy–Green type.One important property of the material model, which will play a crucial role in the current study, is the weak invariance under arbitrary isochoric changes of the reference configuration. Generally speaking, the weak invariance corresponds to a generalized (weak) symmetry of the material. Like any other symmetry property, the weak invariance should be inherited by the discretized constitutive equations. For the general definition of the weak invariance the reader is referred to  [12]. For the concrete material model analyzed in the current study, the weak invariance is formulated as follows. LetF0be arbitrary second rank tensor such thatdet(F0)=1. If the prescribed local loadingC(t),t∈[0,T]is replaced by a new loading historyCnew(t)≔F0−TC(t)F0−1and the initial conditions are transformed according toCinew|t=0=F0−TCi|t=0F0−1,C1inew|t=0=F0−TC1i|t=0F0−1,C2inew|t=0=F0−TC2i|t=0F0−1,then the second Piola–Kirchhoff tensor, predicted by the model, is transformed according to(20)T˜new(t)=F0T˜(t)F0Tfort∈[0,T].Moreover, if the history of the deformation gradient is replaced throughFnew(t)≔F(t)F0−1, then the same Cauchy stressesTwill be predicted by the model(21)Tnew(t)=T(t)fort∈[0,T].For this invariance property, it is necessary and sufficient that the internal variables are transformed according to the following transformation rules (cf.  [50])(22)Cinew(t)=F0−TCi(t)F0−1,C1inew(t)=F0−TC1i(t)F0−1,C2inew(t)=F0−TC2i(t)F0−1.In metals, the plastic flow may exhibit a fluid-like feature that there is not any preferred configuration. This observation motivates the notion of the weak invariance from the physical standpoint. For a more detailed discussion, the reader is referred to  [12]. Some of the commonly used approaches to finite strain plasticity are compatible with the weak invariance requirement, but some of them not  [12]. The weak invariance brings the advantage that the constitutive equations are independent of the choice of the reference configuration. In particular, this property simplifies the analysis of multi-stage forming operations  [50]. In the current study, the weak invariance is utilized as a guide in constructing numerical algorithms.Let us consider a time steptn↦tn+1withΔt≔tn+1−tn>0. Within a local setting, we may suppose thatn+1C≔C(tn+1)andnC≔C(tn)are known and the internal variables are given attnbynCi,nC1i,nC2i,ns,nsd. In order to compute the stress tensorn+1T̃we need to update the internal variables.For what follows, it is useful to introduce the incremental inelastic strain(23)ξ≔Δtn+1λi≥0,which is a non-dimensional quantity. For most practical applications, we may assume thatξ≤0.2.77This upper bound is based on experience (see also  [38]). Since the material response is highly path dependent, one should avoid plastic increments larger than 20%.A new implicit numerical method will be presented in this section which is based on some closed-form solutions for elementary decoupled problems. For this new method, the time stepping procedure will be reduced to the solution of a scalar equation with respect to the unknownξ.Integrating (6)1 and (6)2 fromtntotn+1and taking (12) into account, we obtain the isotropic hardeningn+1R, the arc-lengthn+1s, and its dissipative partn+1sdas explicit functions ofξ(24)n+1R(ξ)=tR+2/3γξ1+2/3βξ,wheretR≔γ(ns−nsd),(25)n+1s(ξ)=ns+2/3ξ,n+1sd(ξ)=nsd+βγ2/3ξn+1R(ξ).Remark 2In case of constantγandβ, a closed-form solution can be derived for the system (6), (12), which can also be used for the time integration. □Assume for a moment thatn+1C1i,n+1C2i, andξ>0are known. In this section we updateCi. As a first step, we express the norm of the driving force as a function ofξ: Combining relations (10)1 and (10)2 we arrive at(26)F=F2(ξ)≔f0(ηξΔt)1/m+2/3(K+n+1R(ξ)).Next, we rewrite the evolution equation (17) as follows(27)Ċi=2λiF(μC¯−c12CiC1i−1Ci−c22CiC2i−1Ci)+βCi,where(28)β=−23λiF(μtr(C¯Ci−1)−c12tr(CiC1i−1)−c22tr(CiC2i−1))∈R.Implementing the Euler Backward method (EBM) to (27), and replacingFthroughF2(ξ)we obtain(29)n+1Ci=nCi+2ξF2(μn+1C¯−c12n+1Cin+1C1i−1n+1Ci−c22n+1Cin+1C2i−1n+1Ci)+βΔtn+1Ci,where the scalarβis unknown since it depends on the unknownn+1Ci.Unfortunately, due to the additive nature of the classical EBM, this method violates the incompressibility restrictiondet(Ci)=1. In order to enforce the exact incompressibility, we may modify the right-hand side of (29) by introducing additional (correction) termεP, thus arriving at(30)n+1Ci=nCi+2ξF2(μn+1C¯−c12n+1Cin+1C1i−1n+1Ci−c22n+1Cin+1C2i−1n+1Ci)+βΔtn+1Ci+εP.Here,εis a suitable scalar andPis a suitable second-rank tensor.88Other modifications of EBM used to enforce the incompressibility were presented in  [51,18].The scalarεis determined such thatdet(n+1Ci)=1. In some publications, the authors suggest the correction of diagonal terms inn+1Cito enforce the incompressibility. Such a correction corresponds toP=1, but this choice ofPviolates the weak invariance of the solution (see Appendix A). In the current study we putP=n+1Ci. Such a choice is compatible with the weak invariance (see Appendix A). After some algebraic manipulations we obtain from (30)(31)zn+1Ci=nCi+2ξF2(μn+1C¯−c12n+1Cin+1C1i−1n+1Ci−c22n+1Cin+1C2i−1n+1Ci),where the scalar unknownz≔1−βΔt−εis determined from the incompressibility conditiondet(n+1Ci)=1. Next, we introduce the following abbreviations(32)c≔c1+c2,Φ≔c1cn+1C1i−1+c2cn+1C2i−1.Using these, we rewrite (31) as follows(33)zn+1Ci=nCi+2ξF2μn+1C¯−ξcF2n+1CiΦn+1Ci.Further, multiplying both sides of (33) withΦ1/2from the left and right, we obtain(34)zΦ1/2n+1CiΦ1/2=Φ1/2[nCi+2ξF2μn+1C¯]Φ1/2−ξcF2Φ1/2n+1CiΦn+1CiΦ1/2.Now let us introduce one more abbreviation(35)A:=Φ1/2[nCi+2ξF2μn+1C¯]Φ1/2.The tensorAis known. In order to simplify the system of equations, we rewrite it with respect to a new unknown variable(36)Y≔Φ1/2n+1CiΦ1/2.Substituting relations (35) and (36) into (34), we obtain a quadratic equation with respect toY(37)zY=A−ξcF2Y2.Recall that, for physical reasons, the tensorn+1Cimust be positive definite. Therefore, the physically reasonableYis also positive definite. Thus, the correct solution of (37) is given by(38)Y=F22ξc[−z1+(z21+4ξcF2A)1/2].Unfortunately, this relation is prone to round-off errors if evaluated step-by-step (see Appendix B). Thus, a reliable method should be used to compute the matrix function on the right-hand side of (38). Using the algebraic identity(X1/2−1)(X1/2+1)=X−1, the closed-form solution (38) can be recast in the form(39)Y=2A[(z21+4ξcF2A)1/2+z1]−1.In the exact arithmetics this formula is equivalent to (38) but it is more advantageous from the numerical standpoint (see Appendix B).Now it remains to identify the unknown parameterz. Recall thatzcan be estimated using the incompressibility conditiondet(n+1Ci)=1, which is equivalent todet(Y)=det(Φ). As shown in Appendix C, a simple formula can be obtained using the perturbation method for smallcξF2:(40)z=z0−trA3z0cξF2+O((cξF2)2),wherez0≔(detAdetΦ)1/3.Neglecting the termsO((cξF2)2), a reliable estimation is obtained, which is accurate forc=0. As will be shown in the following sections, this formula allows us to obtain an accurate and robust local numerical procedure even for finite values ofcξF2.Afterzis evaluated,Yis computed using (39) andCiis updated through(41)n+1Ci∗≔Φ−1/2YΦ−1/2.Note that this solution exactly preserves the weak invariance since it is the solution for system (31) which itself is weakly invariant. Next, since the variablezis not computed exactly, the incompressibility condition can be violated. Thus, to enforce the incompressibility, a final correction step is needed(42)n+1Ci=n+1Ci∗¯.The procedure, described in this subsection, yieldsn+1Cias a function ofn+1C1i,n+1C2i, andξ:(43)n+1Ci=Ci(n+1C1i,n+1C2i,ξ).Let us updateC1iusing evolution equation (18)1. Its Euler Backward discretization yields(44)n+1C1i=nC1i+ξϰ1c1(n+1Ci(n+1C1i)−1)Dn+1C1i.Next, we rewrite this algebraic equation as follows(45)n+1C1i=nC1i+ξϰ1c1n+1Ci+β̃n+1C1i,whereβ̃∈Ris unknown, since it depends onn+1C1i. In order to enforce the incompressibility conditiondet(n+1C1i)=1, we modify the right-hand side by introducing an additional termε̃n+1C1i(46)n+1C1i=nC1i+ξϰ1c1n+1Ci+β̃n+1C1i+ε̃n+1C1i,whereε̃is determined using the incompressibility condition. In analogy to the previous subsection, this additional term is chosen in such a way as not to spoil the weak invariance of the solution. Rearranging the terms, we arrive at(47)z̃n+1C1i=nC1i+ξϰ1c1n+1Ci,wherez̃≔1−β̃−ε̃is computed such thatdet(n+1C1i)=1. The solution for this problem takes a very simple form(48)n+1C1i=nC1i+ξϰ1c1n+1Ci¯.Remark 3Interestingly, this update formula has exactly the same structure as the explicit update formula for the Maxwell fluid which was reported in  [42]. This similarity is due to the fact that the evolution equation (18)1 coincides with the evolution equation for the Maxwell fluid, in case of constantξ. In contrast to the derivation in  [42], the derivation in the current section exploits the notion of the weak invariance as a guideline. □Multiplying (10)1 withΔt, we arrive at the following incremental consistency condition for findingξ(51)ξη=Δt〈1f0f〉m,wheref=f˜(n+1Ci,n+1C1i,n+1C2i,ξ).Here, the overstress functionf˜(∗Ci,∗C1i,∗C2i,∗ξ)is determined from (10)2 and (10)3 as follows(52)f˜(∗Ci,∗C1i,∗C2i,∗ξ)≔F1(∗Ci,∗C1i,∗C2i)−23[K+n+1R(∗ξ)],(53)F1(∗Ci,∗C1i,∗C2i)≔tr[(n+1C∗T̃−∗Ci∗X̃)2],(54)∗T̃(∗Ci)≔μn+1C−1(n+1C¯∗Ci−1)D,(55)∗X̃(∗Ci,∗C1i,∗C2i)≔c12∗Ci−1(∗Ci∗C1i−1)D+c22∗Ci−1(∗Ci∗C2i−1)D.The following predictor–corrector scheme is implemented in this study:1Elastic predictor: Evaluate the trial overstress for frozen internal variables(56)trialf≔f˜(nCi,nC1i,nC2i,0).Iftrialf≤0then the current stress state lies in the elastic domain. Putξ=0,n+1Ci=nCi,n+1C1i=nC1i,n+1C2i=nC2i,n+1s=ns,n+1sd=nsd. The time step is thus complete. Iftrialf>0then proceed to the plastic corrector step.Plastic corrector: The corrector step consists of the following substeps.2.1The initial (rough) estimation forn+1Ciis obtained fromnCiby the same shift (push-forward operation) which bringsnC¯ton+1C¯. More precisely:(57)estCi←Fsh−TnCiFsh−1,whereFsh≔(n+1C−1nC¯)1/2.Next, estimateξ>0by solving the following scalar equation(58)estξ=(trialf−(estξη/Δt)1/m)/(2μ).The internal variablesn+1C1iandn+1C2iare estimated using the explicit update formulas(59)estC1i←C1i(estCi,estξ),estC2i←C2i(estCi,estξ).Resolve the following incremental consistency condition with respect toξ(60)ξη=Δt〈1f0f˜(Ci(estC1i,estC2i,ξ),estC1i,estC2i,ξ)〉m.In other words, a time step is performed with fixedC1i≡estC1iandC2i≡estC2i. Letξ̃be the solution of (60). Using it, compute(61)estξ←ξ̃,estCi←Ci(estC1i,estC2i,ξ̃).For better accuracy, repeat substeps 2.2, 2.3, 2.2, 2.3; then assign(62)ξ←estξ,n+1Ci←estCi,n+1C1i←estC1i,n+1C2i←estC2i.Finally, the variablessansdare updated by (25). The plastic corrector step is thus complete.Remark 4In the current algorithm, substeps 2.2 and 2.3 are repeated for three times. In the general context of the decoupled Euler Backward method, these repetitions correspond to the so-called relaxation iterations. As an alternative to the proposed algorithm, one may consider a full relaxation which consists in numerous repetitions of 2.2 and 2.3, carried to convergence. As will be shown in the following, the full relaxation is not necessary and only three relaxation iterations yield very good results for different metallic materials. Such accurate results are achieved due to the preliminary substep 2.1, which provides a good approximation of the solution even for finite values ofξ. Without the preliminary push-forward (57), the integration procedure would be less accurate. □The push-forward operation (57) exactly retains the weak invariance of the solution (see Appendix D). For that reason, the numerical solution exhibits the same weak invariance property as the original continuum model.In this section, the novel PEBM is tested using two different sets of constitutive parameters pertaining to two different materials. The accuracy of the stress computation by PEBM will be compared with the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction (EBMSC) and the exponential method (EM). These conventional methods are shortly summarized in Appendix E.We adopt the experimental data reported for 5754-O aluminum alloy in  [55,1]. Four different shear tests are employed for the parameter identification: three Bauschinger tests with different prestrain levels and a monotonic test. For this material, the rate-dependence is weak  [1]; therefore, we switch-off the viscosity by puttingη=0. The identified constitutive parameters are summarized in Table 1. The comparison of the theoretical and experimental results is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from the figure, the model with two parameters for the isotropic hardening and four parameters for the kinematic hardening describes the real stress response with a good fidelity.The experimental data for 42CrMo4 steel were reported in  [46]. For details concerning the experimental set up and simulation of the torsion test, the reader is referred to  [46]. All tests are performed with a constant shear strain rate|γ̇shear|=0.07s−1. Two different cyclic torsion tests are adopted in the current study for the identification of material parameters. The identified parameters are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the considered model describes the nonlinear stress response upon the load reversal with a good accuracy.For all the following tests we switch-off the viscous effects: material parameters from Table 2 are taken for 42CrMo4 steel withη=0andm=1.We note that the material parameters which appear in Tables 1 and 2 correspond to a very fast saturation of nonlinear kinematic hardening with large backstresses in the saturated state. From the numerical standpoint, such a type of stress response is highly unfavorable: much larger computational errors are expected for these parameters than in case of slow saturation with small backstresses. Thus, the following numerical tests are assumed to be representative for a broad class of metallic materials.Consider the time instancesT0=0s,T1=100s,T2=200s,T3=300s. Let us simulate the stress response in the time intervalt∈[T0,T3]for the following local loading program(63)F(t)=F′(t)¯,where the auxiliary functionF′(t)is given byF′(t)≔{(1−t/T1)F1+(t/T1)F2ift∈[T0,T1](2−t/T1)F2+(t/T1−1)F3ift∈(T1,T2](3−t/T1)F3+(t/T1−2)F4ift∈(T2,T3].Here,F1,F2,F3, andF4are the key points which are defined in a fixed Cartesian coordinate system throughF1≔1,F2≔(20001200012),F3≔(110010001),F4≔(12000200012).This program defines a rather arbitrary loading, representative for metal forming applications. Note that this loading program exhibits an abrupt change of the load path att=100sandt=200s. For the numerical test we impose the following initial conditions, corresponding to unloaded isotropic initial state:(64)Ci|t=0=1,C1i|t=0=1,C2i|t=0=1,s|t=0=0,sd|t=0=0.The numerical solution obtained with extremely small time step (Δt=0.0025s) using the EBMSC will be seen as the exact solution. The numerical error function is computed as a distance between the exact and the numerically computed Cauchy stresses(65)Error(t):=‖Tnumerical(t)−Texact(t)‖.The error function is plotted for different values of the time step sizeΔt; Figs. 3 and 4correspond to material parameters for Al 5754O and 42CrMo4 steel, respectively. The numerical tests reveal that the proposed partitioned Euler Backward method (PEBM) and the conventional Euler Backward with subsequent correction (EBMSC) have a similar integration error even for very big time stepsΔt=10s. Both algorithms are first order accurate and they are comparable in accuracy, but the computational effort for the new algorithm is much smaller than for EBMSC. A more detailed discussion of the computational costs will be presented in Section  4.4.The iso-error maps are useful for the visualization of the integration error within a single time step  [29,56]. In this subsection we consider only incompressible deformation paths which can be described by(66)F(t)=F11(t)e1⊗e1+(F11(t))−1/2(e2⊗e2+e3⊗e3)+F12(t)e1⊗e2.Just as in the previous subsection, the viscous effects are switched off. Thus, the stress response is rate independent. For simplicity, the timetis understood here as a non-dimensional monotonic loading parameter. Moreover, we switch off the isotropic hardening as well, by puttingγ=0for both materials. To mimic the effect of isotropic hardening, we putK=178.8MPafor the AA 5754-O andK=400MPafor the 42CrMo4 steel.First, we consider a 20% prestrain in uniaxial tension(67)F11(t)=1+0.2t,F12(t)=0,t∈[0,1].This prestrain is simulated by 500 time steps. After that, a single time step is performed to a new state, characterized by(F11,F12). The numerical solution obtained for this step using EBMSC with 300 subincrements is considered as the exact solution. Using this exact solution, the error is defined as in the previous subsection (see Eq. (65)). The iso-error maps for the new algorithm (PEBM), for the Euler Backward method with subsequent correction (EBMSC), and for the exponential map (EM) are presented in Fig. 5for the 5754-O aluminum alloy and in Fig. 6for the 42CrMo4 steel. As in the previous subsection, the computational methods exhibit a similar numerical error. For all three methods, the error is relatively small in the recent loading direction and large in the opposite direction. The PEBM-error is slightly larger than the EBMSC-error for strain increments opposite to the recent loading direction and slightly smaller for increments in the loading direction.Next, we consider a combined prestrain with 10% tension and 10% shear(68)F11(t)=1+0.1t,F12(t)=0.1t,t∈[0,1].The iso-error maps for free different integration algorithms are shown in Fig. 7for the 5754-O aluminum alloy and in Fig. 8for the 42CrMo4 steel. Just as in case of uniaxial prestrain, all three algorithms are equivalent regarding the accuracy of the stress computation. Again, small errors occur in the recent loading direction along with relatively large errors in the opposite direction.For the novel PEBM, the computational effort depends solely on the number of Newton iterations required to resolve the incremental consistency condition (60). For the conventional EBMSC and EM, a system of 19 coupled nonlinear equations has to be resolved at each time step (cf. Appendix E). The simultaneous numerical solution of these equations is problematic for large strain increments. In order to obtain a more reliable procedure, we employ the return mapping approach. First, a numerical procedure is created which computes the unknownn+1Ci,n+1C1i, andn+1C2ias functions ofξ. We call this a “ξ-step”. Eachξ-step is based on the iterative process of the Newton–Raphson type where 18 nonlinear equations have to be solved. Then, the correct value ofξis found as a solution of the incremental consistency condition (105). Just as for PEBM, this scalar equation is solved using the Newton method. For the novel PEBM each Newton iteration requires a finite number of operations on 3×3 matrices (cf. Sections  3.2 and 3.3). These operations include the matrix multiplication, computation of the square root and computation of the inverse. On the other hand, for the conventional EBMSC and EM each Newton iteration calls theξ-step, which is much more expensive since an 18×18 matrix has to be built and inverted several times within the iterative process. Generally, the Newton iteration for the PEBM is approximately two orders of magnitude cheaper than the Newton iteration for the EBMSC or EM.Since theξ-step involves the iterative process, it is (a priory) less reliable than a closed-form solution used in PEBM. Forξ>0.1, the straightforward implementation of the Newton–Raphson method to theξ-step yields a divergent iteration process. In order to obtain a reliable numerical procedure for EBMSC and EM, the[0,ξ]interval is subincremented, which further increases the computational costs.The setting used in the previous subsection can be also adopted for the analysis of the computational efforts. Toward that end we consider a combined prestrain with 10% tension and 10% shear, as described by (68). The prestrain is simulated numerically by 500 time steps. After that, a single time step is performed to a new(F11,F12)-state. The number of Newton iterations required by PEBM, EBMSC and EM to make this step is plotted in Fig. 9. Recall that for the PEBM the incremental consistency condition has to be solved for three times, since three relaxation iterations are implemented in the current study (cf. Remark 4). Within the first relaxation iteration, the initial approximation for the unknownξis zero. For the subsequent relaxation iterations, the solution from the previous relaxation iterations acts as the initial approximation. The total (accumulated) number of Newton iterations is plotted for the PEBM. Although PEBM requires more iterations than the conventional methods, the difference in the iteration number is not large. Therefore, PEBM is still much more efficient than EBMSC or EM. In contrast to the conventional EBMSC and EM, no convergence issues are observed for the novel PEBM.The proposed PEBM is implemented into the commercial FEM code MSC.MARC employing the Hypela2 interface. In order to demonstrate the correctness of the numerical implementation, we consider two different bending-dominated problems with finite displacements and rotations. In both problems, the material parameters correspond to the 5754-O aluminum alloy (cf. Table 1).First, a displacement-controlled problem is solved. A cantilever beam is modeled as shown in Fig. 10(left). The left end of the beam is clamped; the right end is subjected to a prescribed vertical displacement with zero rotation. A total number of 30 elements of type Hex20 with the full integration is used. A series of tests is performed with a constant time step size within each test; the corresponding reaction–displacement curves are shown in Fig. 10 (right). The numerical solution obtained using 720 time steps (withΔt=1/240s) serves as a reference. As can be seen, even for the large time steps (Δt=1/8s, 24 times steps), the conventional EBMSC and the novel PEBM produce almost identical results. Both methods exhibit quadratic convergence and they require approximately the same number of iterations.Further, a non-monotonic force-controlled loading is applied to the Cook membrane as shown in Fig. 11. The mesh contains 213 elements of type Hex20 with the full integration. The obtained force–displacement curves are shown in Fig. 11(right) for different values of the time step size. The numerical solution obtained using 240 time steps (withΔt=1/80s) serves as a reference. Just as in the previous problem, EBMSC and PEBM produce almost identical results, even for the large time steps (Δt=1/5s). Again, both methods exhibit quadratic convergence and they require approximately the same number of iterations.Concluding this subsection, the conventional EBMSC and the novel EBM seem to be equivalent regarding the accuracy and stability of the global FE procedure, even if large strain increments are involved.
