@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study proposes the multi-objective programming (MOP) method for solving network DEA (NDEA) models. In the proposed method, the divisional efficiencies (within an organization) and the overall efficiency of the organization are formulated as separate objective functions in the multi-objective programming model. Compared with conventional DEA where the intermediate processes and products are ignored, this work measures the organization's overall efficiency without neglecting the efficiencies of its subunits. Two case studies demonstrate the proposed NDEA–MOP's utility in measuring the efficiencies of an organization with concerning interactive internal process.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) [1,2] has been widely used in assessing the relative efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs). The BCC model developed by Banker et al. [1] assesses the relative efficiencies of DMUs by extending the constant-returns-to-scale CCR model [2] to variable returns to scale. Consider n DMUs (j=1, …, n) under assessment. Each DMU consumes m inputs (i=1, …, m) and produces s outputs (r=1, …, s), denoted byX1j,X2j,…,XmjandY1j,Y2j,…,Ysjrespectively. The efficiency of DMUkcan be computed by the BCC and CCR models as follows:(1)MaxEk=∑r=1surYrk−u0∑i=1mviXik(BCC)s.t.∑r=1surYrj−u0∑i=1mviXij≤1,j=1,2,…,nur,vi≥εr=1,2,…,s;i=1,2,…,mu0unrestrictedinsign(2)MaxEk=∑r=1surYrk∑i=1mviXik(CCR)s.t.∑r=1surYrj∑i=1mviXij≤1,j=1,2,…,nur,vi≥εr=1,2,…,s;i=1,2,…,mIn (1) and (2), the objective function Ekis maximized for every DMUkindividually, where Xikand Yrkare the ith input and rth output of DMUk;ur,viare the weights of the outputs and inputs, respectively; and ɛ is a small positive value which ensures that all weights are nonnegative. In the BCC model, when the intercept of the production function u0>0, the efficiency frontier presents decreasing returns to scale; if u0<0, it manifests increasing returns to scale; and when u0=0, the model results in the constant returns to scale CCR model.However, from a decision-making perspective, evaluating a DMU involves examining its performance at the firm level as well as the divisional level. The divisional decision-makers in an organization are expected to cooperate to maximize overall performance. Under such circumstances, conventional DEA methods need enhancement to reflect the collaborative interactions in a DMU.Conventional DEA usually adopts two types of models in measuring efficiencies: the aggregation and separation approaches. In the aggregation model, the DMU is evaluated as a black box and the internal linking activities are de-emphasized. Consequently we cannot evaluate the performance of individual divisions within the DMU. In the separation model, conversely, each division in a DMU is treated as an independent unit and the linking activities between other divisions are totally neglected. Both methods are insufficient for evaluating the efficiencies of the organization's linking processes. Network DEA (NDEA) [4,5] arises due to its competence in evaluating both overall and divisional efficiencies in a unified mechanism while attending to internal interactions within DMUs. Network DEA's main objective is to measure the overall efficiency of a DMU, with the divisional efficiencies as the components.Numerous studies have been devoted to designing NDEA models. Recently, Tone and Tsutsui [6] proposed a general slack-based network DEA approach, Network SBM (NSBM), which can evaluate intermediate products formally. Cook et al. [7] review a special type of two-stage network DEA model where all of the first-stage outputs are the only inputs to the second stage. They additionally classify all methods in two-stage DEA into Stackelberg and cooperative methods. Further Cook et al. [8] examine the general problem of an open multistage process by presenting the overall efficiency as an additive weighted average of the efficiencies of the individual components or stages. In response to Tone and Tsutsui's work [6], Fukuyama and Mirdehghan [9] propose a network DEA approach for identifying the efficiency status of each DMU and its divisions so that inappropriate decisions due to multiple optima can be avoided.This study intends to propose an alternative approach to network DEA problems via the multi-objective programming (MOP) method. Multiple objective programming is characterized by a set of objective functions that must be optimized simultaneously and a set of well-defined constraints to be satisfied [10]. Zimmermann [11] develops the fuzzy approach by searching for the optimal solution with the highest degree of membership (satisfaction) in the feasible region. Lee and Li [12] later extend Zimmermann's work to fuzzy multiple objective programming. Evolutionary algorithms have recently become a widely used methodology in MOP. Gen et al. [13] apply the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) approach to network models and optimization. Shayanfar et al. [14] have developed a new hybrid algorithm incorporating game theory and the genetic algorithm method to address generation expansion planning problems in the energy decision-making of investments. Later, Gitizadeh and Aghaei [15] utilized a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to solve the multi-objective electricity energy market-clearing problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its improved versions have been implemented for MOP by introducing fuzzy sets [16,17], combining stochastic optimization [18] and the shuffled frog-leaping (SFL) algorithm [19], designing a new mutation method to improve global searching ability [20], etc. Other attempts to solve MOP include the stochastic multi-objective framework [21,22], lexicographic optimization [23,24], the honeybee mating optimization algorithm [25], and so on.The purpose of this study is to propose the NDEA–MOP as an alternative approach to processing network DEA. Based on the CCR and BCC models, the overall as well as divisional efficiencies within a DMU are defined as separate objective functions to be optimized cohesively. The case studies of electric power companies [6] and the solar energy industry are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of NDEA–MOP. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: “Model formulation” section develops the NDEA–MOP based on BCC and CCR and the solution procedure based on the fuzzy approach [11]. In “Case studies” section, we present the case studies and compare the results with the related research. The conclusions are given in last section.This work follows a part of Tone and Tsutsui's notations [6]. Consider n DMUs (j=1, …, n) consisting of K divisions (k=1, …, K). Let mkand rkbe the numbers of inputs to and outputs from Division k, respectively. We denote the link streaming from Division k to Division h by (k, h) and the set of links by L. The observed input resources to DMUjat Division k are{xjk∈R+mk}(j=1, …, n; k=1, …, K); the output products from DMUjat Division k are{yjk∈R+rk}(j=1, …, n; k=1, …, K); the linking intermediate products from Division k to Division h are{zj(k,h)∈R+t(k,h)}(j=1, …, n;(k,h)∈L)wheret(k,h)is the number of items in Link (k, h). This study develops the cooperative multi-objective programming models for evaluating a general network structure formulated with the NDEA–MOP models.Two types of the NDEA–MOP can be developed by BCC and CCR as follows:BCC–MOP(3)MaxEo(DMU:firmlevel)MaxEok=∑r=1rkurkYrok+∑∀(k,h)∑p=1t(k,h)μhkZop(k,h)−αk∑i=1mkvikXiok+∑∀(g,k)∑q=1t(g,k)ωgkZoq(g,k)k=1,...,K(divisionallevel)s.t.∑r=1rkurkYrjk+∑∀(k,h)∑p=1t(k,h)μhkZjp(k,h)−αk∑i=1mkvikXijk+∑∀(g,k)∑q=1t(g,k)ωgkZjq(g,k)≤1j=1,2,…,n;k=1,2,…,Kurk,vik,μhk,ωgk≥ε>0,αkunrestrictedinsign,k=1,2,…,Kr=1,2,…,rk;i=1,2,…,mk;all(k,h),(g,k)∈LCCR–MOP(4)MaxEo(DMU:firmlevel)MaxEok=∑r=1rkurkYrok+∑∀(k,h)∑p=1t(k,h)μhkZop(k,h)∑i=1mkvikXiok+∑∀(g,k)∑q=1t(g,k)ωgkZoq(g,k)k=1,...,K(divisionallevel)s.t.∑r=1rkurkYrjk+∑∀(k,h)∑p=1t(k,h)μhkZjp(k,h)∑i=1mkvikXijk+∑∀(g,k)∑q=1t(g,k)ωgkZjq(g,k)≤1j=1,2,…,n;k=1,2,…,Kurk,vik,μhk,ωgk≥ε>0,r=1,2,…,rk;i=1,2,…,mk;all(k,h),(g,k)∈LIn the NDEA–MOP models, the objective functionEokmeasures the efficiency of Division k at DMUo, where the weighted links outgoing from Division k,μhkZjp(k,h),∀(k,h),p=1,…,t(k,h), are regarded as the (intermediate) outputs of Division k and the incoming inputs to Division h,ωkhZjq(k,h). The overall efficiencyEoof DMUois defined as the convex combinationEo=∑k=1KwkEokof the K efficiency scores, wherewkdenotes the weight representing the relative contribution of division k. The two types of NDEA–MOP in (3) and (4) are designed as cooperative models; that is, the strategic resources are allocated collaboratively by each division as well as at the enterprise decision level.Based on the fuzzy approach proposed by Zimmermann [11], the following algorithm is developed to solve the model in (3) and (4). To ensure the solvability, one extra constraint∑i=1mkvikXiok+∑g=1t(g,k)ωgkZro(g,k)=1is added for each division k in DMUoto transform the fractional DEA model into a linear programming model [3].Step 1: Obtain the ideal solution for every objective.To obtain the ideal solution, every objective is optimized independently of other objectives. For DMUo, we maximizeEok,k=1,...,Kindividually to determine their ideal objective values,Eok*,k=1,...,K.Step 2: Obtain the anti-ideal solution for every objective.To obtain the anti-ideal solution, every objective is computed in the opposite way regardless of other objectives. Now, we minimizeEok,k=1,...,Kto determine their anti-ideal solutionsEok−,k=1,...,K.Step 3: Define the membership function of every objective by its ideal and anti-ideal solutions as follows:(5)μEok(Eok)=Eok−Eok−Eok*−Eok−The membership function estimates the fulfilment level of every objective.Step 4: Two types of solutions can be obtained according to the decision setting: compensatory and non-compensatory solutions [12]. The compensatory solution maximizes the weighted mean membership function of all objectives as follows:Compensatory(6)Maxλ=∑k=1KwkμEok(Eok)s.t.∑k=1Kwk=1μEok(Eok)=Eok−Eok−Eok*−Eok−k=1,...,Kalloriginalconstraintswherewkis the weight for Division k. On the other hand, the non-compensatory solution maximizes the minimal membership functions for all objectives as shown below:Non-compensatory(7)Maxλ=mink=1,...,KμEok(Eok)s.t.λ≤μEok(Eok),k=1,...,KμEok(Eok)=Eok−Eok−Eok*−Eok−alloriginalconstraintswhere λ is the minimum of all membership functions to be maximized. In (6) and (7), every division in DMUocan be evaluated simultaneously, and then the overall scoreEo=∑k=1KwkEokis measured for DMUo. Because the functional divisions cannot redeem for each other, this study will adopt the non-compensatory solution in (7). The flowchart of NDEA–MOP is presented in Fig. 1.For processing the linking activities and products between divisions, we formulate the free-link and the fixed-link scenarios in the NDEA–MOP models, respectively. In the free-link scenario, the linking activities are freely determined while keeping continuity between input and output. That is, the weightμhkof the outgoing linkZjp(k,h)at division k and the weightωkhof the incoming linkZjp(k,h)at division h are optimized discretionarily in the model. In the fixed-link case, the linking activities are kept unchanged with the following constraint:(8)(outputfromdivisionk)μhkZjp(k,h)=ωkhZjp(k,h)(inputtodivisionh)The constraint (8) requires that the intermediate link remain constant while it flows between division k and division h. Based on our observations, we have formulated the following propositions.Proposition 1Free-link networks result in greater or equal efficiencies compared with fixed-link networks.Because the fixed-link case has the extra constraint (8), it is apparent that free-link cases obtain non-worse results compared with fixed-link cases.Proposition 2If all links are totally free (able to increase or decrease discretionarily), the free-link NDEA–MOP model reduces structurally to the separation model.In the free-link networks, the weight of a link as either an incoming or an outgoing one is freely allocated, so the constraints for divisions may not interfere with each other while maximizing the individual divisional efficiency. Consequently, the free-link network models reduce structurally to the separation models, for both BCC and CCR models.This section presents experimental studies in two cases: the electronic power companies analyzed by Tone and Tsutsui [6] and the solar energy industry in Taiwan. In the following cases, BCC–MOP and CCR–MOP are implemented, each considering fixed-link and free-link scenarios.This case concerns electric power companies with three linked divisions [6]. Based on the business process model in Fig. 2, the sample data are given in Table 1. Following [6], the overall and divisional efficiencies are computed by (3) and (4), where the overall scoreEois defined as the weighted sum of divisional efficiencies∑k=13wkEok, w1=0.4, w2=0.2, w3=0.4. The overall efficiencies are shown in Tables 2 and 3and the divisional details are summarized in Tables 4–9. In both the BCC–MOP and CCR–MOP models, we find that free-link cases obtain superior scores to fixed-link cases, which supports our Proposition 1. Additionally, the separation method results in identical outcomes to those from free-link cases using BCC–MOP and CCR–MOP, which supports our Proposition 2.In the free-link scenarios, the weight of a link as either incoming or outgoing is freely allocated, so the constraints for divisions may not interfere with each other while maximizing the individual divisional efficiency. When the conservation of the intermediate product is considered, the following constraint can be added to adjust the linking:(9)(outputfromdivisionk)μhkZjp(k,h)≥ωkhZjp(k,h)(inputtodivisionh)If (9) is activated, the efficiency will lie between the fixed-link and free-link cases and, under some circumstances, may converge to the fixed-link case.Recently, solar energy [26–29] has been a fast-growing industry worldwide. Because solar energy is pollution-free and does not deplete natural resources, the industry is regarded as one of the possible solutions to the energy crisis and global warming.Briefly speaking, the firms involved in the supply chain of the solar energy industry include [26]:Upstream: raw silicon material, wafers and ingotsMidstream: photovoltaic (PV) cellsDownstream: PV modules and PV systemsHowever, in the past year the industry has reported unsatisfactory performance in profitability and market values. We are interested to find out why this industry has struggled while serving such pressing global needs. What obstacles exist to the competitiveness of solar energy firms and supply chains? To make a comprehensive diagnosis, this study intends to examine the industry's activities and efficiencies. The process model of the solar energy industry is illustrated in Fig. 3.In Fig. 3, three divisions are evaluated: R&D, production and sales. Following the convention of Fig. 2, the intermediate outputs (links) are represented with dotted circles. The data of 26 sample companies are collected in fiscal year 2011, including 5 upstream, 12 midstream and 9 downstream companies in Taiwan's solar industry.By the NDEA–MOP models in (3) and (4), the solar energy manufacturers are evaluated at the divisional and firm levels. The results are shown in Tables 10–17.Apparently, the results still support our Propositions 1 and 2. In Table 10, by BCC–MOP the average overall efficiencies of fixed-link and free-link cases are 0.528 and 0.687, respectively. One DMU is identified as efficient with fixed-link BCC–MOP and two are efficient with free-link BCC–MOP. In Table 11, by CCR–MOP the average overall efficiencies of fixed-link and free-link cases are 0.400 and 0.564, respectively. No DMU is efficient with fixed-link CCR–MOP, and one is efficient with free-link CCR–MOP. The overall and divisional efficiencies are summarized in Table 18.Under the assumption of variable returns to scale (BCC–MOP), both fixed-link and free-link cases show unsatisfactory performance in Division 1 (R&D) and Division 3 (Sales and profitability). Under the assumption of constant returns to scale (CCR–MOP), all divisions perform poorly, especially Division 3. We suppose that the solar energy industry has been burdened with insufficient profitability and R&D value. However, the production functionality is relatively efficient. Solar energy enterprises may therefore seek to upgrade their R&D investments and expand their niche in both domestic and international markets.According to Theorem 2 in Tone and Tsutsui [6], under the variable-returns-to-scale (BCC) case, every division has at least one divisionally efficient DMU. By the BCC–MOP model, that theorem holds except for Division 1 in fixed link network, case 1. Tone and Tsutsui [6] also claim that under the constant-returns-to-scale assumption with the fixed-link case, every division has at least one divisionally efficient DMU. Our findings show that the free-link, rather than the fixed-link, CCR–MOP supports their theorem. Moreover, every division has at least one divisionally efficient DMU under the free-link variable-returns-to-scale assumption. Based on the experimental results of NDEA–MOP, we offer the following proposition:Proposition 3Regardless of which assumption of returns to scale applies, in the free-link case every division has at least one divisionally efficient DMU.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, we propose the NDEA–MOP as the alternative approach for solving network DEA. In our NDEA–MOP models, the overall as well as divisional efficiencies for DMUs are evaluated in a cohesive way. By two illustrative case studies, we experiment two types of NDEA–MOP models: BCC–MOP and CCR–MOP, each with fixed-link and free-link scenarios. The results show that:1.The free-link cases result in greater or equal efficiencies than those in the fixed-link cases.If all links are free (and may increase or decrease discretionarily), the free-link NDEA–MOP model reduces structurally to the separation model. However, if the allocation is restricted by the law of conservation, the efficiency will lie between fixed-link and totally free-link cases.Under any assumption of returns to scale, in the free-link case every division has at least one divisionally efficient DMU.
