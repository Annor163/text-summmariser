@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Plants have evolved exquisite molecular mechanisms to adapt to diverse abiotic stresses. MicroRNAs play an important role in stress response in plants. However, whether the other small RNAs (sRNAs) possess stress-related roles remains elusive. In this study, thousands of sRNAs responsive to cold, drought and salt stresses were identified in rice seedlings and panicles by using high-throughput sequencing data. These sRNAs were classified into 12 categories, including “Panicle_Cold_Down”, “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Up”, “Seedling_Salt_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Up”. The stress-responsive sRNAs enriched in Argonaute 1 were extracted for target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, which enabled network construction. Within certain subnetworks, some target genes were further supported by microarray data. Literature mining indicated that certain targets were potentially involved in stress response. These results demonstrate that the established networks are biologically meaningful. We discovered that in some cases, one sRNA sequence could be assigned to two or more categories. Moreover, within certain target-centered subnetworks, one transcript was regulated by several stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to different categories. It implies that these subnetworks are potentially implicated in stress signal crosstalk. Together, our results could advance the current understanding of the biological role of plant sRNAs in stress signaling.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Plants under abiotic stresses such as heat, cold, drought and salt will suffer from physiological and metabolic damages harmful to growth and development. As compensation, the plants have evolved exquisite regulatory mechanisms to response to specific stress signals, thus improving their tolerance (Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011; Seki et al., 2007; Shinozaki et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2002). These stress-related molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied in plants these years (Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010; Zhu, 2002). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one of the small RNA (sRNA) species of ∼21nt in length, were demonstrated to play an important role in stress signal transduction in plants (Sunkar et al., 2007). For examples, the nitrate-responsive miR393–AFB3 regulatory module is involved in controlling root system architecture of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) (Vidal et al., 2010). miR395 is inducible by sulphur starvation and is important for sulfate assimilation in Arabidopsis (Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004; Kawashima et al., 2011, 2009). miR399 is involved in phosphate signaling in both Arabidopsis and rice (Bari et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2008). With the widespread application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) in sRNA biology, an unexpectedly huge universe of plant endogenous sRNAs, in addition to the miRNAs, has been uncovered. However, whether these largely unclassified sRNAs have stress-related biological roles remain unclear. To date, only a few cases have been reported. An impressive example was provided by Borsani et al. (2005). The nat-siRNAs (short interfering RNAs derived from natural antisense transcript (NAT) pairs) produced from a cis-NAT pair SRO5-P5CDH are involved in salinity stress response of Arabidopsis (Borsani et al., 2005).A recent study on rice sRNAs generated tens of sRNA HTS data sets including those prepared from seedlings and panicles under specific abiotic stress treatments (drought, salt and cold) (Jeong et al., 2011). In that study, Jeong and his colleagues mainly focused on the rice miRNAs for their stress responsiveness and target genes. However, we recognized that these sRNA HTS data sets were invaluable resources to evaluate the potential roles of the other unclassified sRNA species in abiotic stress response and tolerance of rice. In this consideration, we set out to do a comprehensive search for the stress-responsive sRNAs in the rice seedlings and the panicles. As a result, thousands of stress-responsive sRNAs were identified, which were classified into 12 categories, “Panicle_Cold_Down” (the sRNAs down-regulated under the cold treatment in panicles), “Panicle_Cold_Up”, “Panicle_Drought_Down”, “Panicle_Drought_Up”, “Panicle_Salt_Down”, “Panicle_Salt_Up”, “Seedling_Cold_Down”, “Seedling_Cold_Up”, “Seedling_Drought_Down”, “Seedling_Drought_Up”, “Seedling_Salt_Down” and “Seedling_Salt_Up”. For target identification, only the stress-responsive sRNAs enriched in Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-associated silencing complexes were included. Based on the target lists supported by degradome sequencing data, regulatory networks mediated by specific stress-responsive sRNAs were constructed. Deeper investigation on certain subnetworks based on microarray data and literature mining enabled us to gain further supportive evidences for the potential involvement of the target genes in stress signaling. On the other hand, it indicates that the networks are biologically meaningful. We also discovered that for some sRNA sequences, they could be assigned to two or more of the 12 categories mentioned above. Moreover, within certain target-centered subnetworks, one transcript was simultaneously regulated by several stress-responsive sRNAs assigned to different categories. This kind of regulation sometimes exists in the panicles or the seedlings specifically. Based on these observations, we proposed that these subnetworks were potentially implicated in stress signal interactions, some of which might occur with organ- or developmental stage-specific patterns. Taken together, our results could advance the current understanding of the biological functions of the sRNAs, in addition to the miRNAs, in stress response, stress tolerance and signal interactions in plants.
