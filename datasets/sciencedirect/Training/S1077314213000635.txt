@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a novel calibration method for catadioptric systems made up of an axial symmetrical mirror and a pinhole camera with its optical center located at the mirror axis. The calibration estimates the relative camera/mirror position and the extrinsic rotation and translation w.r.t. the world frame. The procedure requires a single image of a (possibly planar) calibration object. We show how most of the calibration parameters can be estimated using linear methods (Direct-Linear-Transformation algorithm) and cross-ratio. Two remaining parameters are obtained by using non-linear optimization. We present experimental results on simulated and real images.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Catadioptric vision systems use a combination of cameras and mirrors to acquire images. They can provide some advantages over more traditional camera systems, namely in terms of increased field-of-view (usually through reflection off curved mirrors) and/or single image multi-view geometry (with the use of multiple mirrors). Several configurations have been proposed and studied, alongside with tailor-made or more generic calibration methods.Central catadioptric systems [1] allow for a single-viewpoint projection model, by the use of particular mirror shapes restrictively aligned with an orthographic or perspective camera. Calibration methods for these systems include using the image of lines in the scene [2–4], self-calibration using tracked point on several images [5,6] or using a calibration pattern [3,7–9]. A recent review and comparison of calibration techniques focusing on central systems can be found in [10].Some calibration methods propose a general, un-parameterized, camera [11–13]. These can model central and non-central catadioptric systems, as well as more unconventional camera designs. The intrinsic calibration of the camera consists on associating a 3D direction with each pixel in image.Most non-central catadioptric systems are modeled as a perspective camera and an axial symmetric mirror of conical section (sphere, paraboloid, ellipsoid and hyperboloid). The geometry of image formation is dependent on the intrinsic parameters of the camera, on the particular shape and relative position of the mirror. Some calibration methods assume an independent calibration of the perspective camera [14–16], which can be robustly achieved using well-established techniques for conventional cameras. Many consider the mirror shape to be accurately known from the manufacturing process [17–20]. The mirror pose w.r.t. the camera is often estimated by identifying the mirror boundaries in the image (usually a conic) [17,14,21,6,20].Self-calibration approaches use point correspondences on several (at least two) images [22,17,23]. Caglioti et al. [24] used the reflected image of lines on axial-symmetric mirrors as the calibration object. Sagawa et al. [25] applied projected parallel light to estimate mirror location. Grossberg and Nayar [26] and Tardif and Sturm [27] used a computer screen and a projector to generate coded structured-light calibration patterns and achieve a dense mapping of the image pixels. Morel and Fofi [28] used polarized light.A comprehensive survey of camera models used in panoramic image acquisition devices, as well as calibration approaches, is presented in [29].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented a method for the estimation of the mirror position and extrinsic parameters in axial non-central catadioptric systems, i.e., systems made up of an axial symmetric mirror and a projective camera with its optical center located along the symmetry axis (but not necessarily orientated with the axis). We assume an internally calibrated pinhole camera and require the use of a calibration object, that can be planar. A single image is sufficient to perform the calibration procedure.The camera/mirror relative position is determined with two parameters: the image position of the intersection of the symmetry axis with the image plane and the distance from the camera center to the mirror. The extrinsic parameters are fully determined through a rotation matrix and a translation vector.A linear projection equation is established between 3D points and 1D image features, which enables the use of the DLT algorithm in the estimation of the extrinsic rotation and translation, the latter up to one undetermined component. The cross-ratio is used as an invariant under the axial-symmetric geometry to determine the image of the axis. Non-linear optimization methods are applied in the estimation of the remaining parameters.Regarding the estimation of mirror/camera relative position, our approach provides a significant alternative to methods that require the identification of the mirror boundary in the image (e.g. [17,14,21,6,34]). The calibration procedure is accurate and much easier to automate. Since the calibration object can be planar, the setup is easy to implement.The estimation of the extrinsic parameters, up to one translation parameter, is achieved with a simple and linear procedure, even in the presence of a highly non-linear image formation geometry. In applications that do not require the z-component of the extrinsic translation to be determined, the extrinsic parameters are obtained without full knowledge of the vision system characteristics (unknown mirror shape and distance to mirror). As an example of one such application, consider a robot navigating on a plane, equipped with an omnidirectional vision system. If known landmarks (calibration points) are visible in the image, the robot’s pose (extrinsic parameters) can be fully retrieved using the method of Section 4, as the z-component of the translation is constrained by the plane on which the robot moves.
