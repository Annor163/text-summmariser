@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The effect of 1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) doping on electroluminescent properties of poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD) was investigated. A series of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) integrated with (i) single-layer poly-TPD, (ii) blended single-layer poly-TPD:TPBi or (iii) bilayer poly-TPD/TPBi were fabricated and characterized. An excimer emission band at 500nm was found in the poly-TPD film, poly-TPD:TPBi (1:1) blend film, and poly-TPD/TPBi bilayer film. It was observed that the planar geometry of poly-TPD was related to the formation of excimers. The electromer emission, which was absent in photoluminescence, was investigated by applying an external electrical field to devices with non-doped and TPBi-doped poly-TPD. Only the electromer emission was observed in the devices with TPBi-doped poly-TPD, due to the impeded intrinsic and excimer emissions. The planar geometry of poly-TPD molecules may be destroyed due to the longer inter-ion distance with the doping of TPBi.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, extensive studies have been reported on the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are substantially different from the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the OLEDs’ component materials [1–4]. The long-wavelength emission bands have often been observed in the EL spectra of OLEDs, which is mainly attributed to the emission of photons resulting from the direct irradiative recombination of holes and electrons residing in two adjacent molecules. If the two molecules are the same, it may lead to the formation of excimers or electromers [5]. On the other hand, when the two molecules are different, the recombination may result in the formation of exciplexes or electroplexes [6]. The formation of electromers is mainly attributed to the cross-electron transition from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a molecule to the positively-charged highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the nearest neighbor or a nearby molecule within a close intermolecular range [5,7]. However, the direct LUMO–LUMO electron transition may lead to a singlet-localized molecular or excimer state in an EL process. The cross-electron transition probability is comparable to or greater than the direct-electron transition probability of a localized state molecule when the e–h pair lifetime increases. A higher cross-electron transition probability will impede the effective intermolecular transfer of carriers, so an intermolecular ion pair with longer separation distance may be more favorable to form the electromer. On the contrary, an intermolecular ion pair with shorter separation distance may facilitate excimer formation [5]. The studies outlined in this article seek to examine the formation of these excimer and electromer states.As we know, poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine] (poly-TPD) has been widely used as the material that transfers holes in bilayer and multilayer OLEDs. Due to its good solubility and film-forming property [8–11], poly-TPD is often used to fabricate effective quantum dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) and white-light OLEDs. N-N′-biphenyl-N,N′-(bis(3-methyl phenyl)-1,1-biphenyl-4,4-diamine), also commonly known as TPD (Fig. 1), is an organic compound with a structure very similar to that of the biphenyl-containing repeat unit of poly-TPD (Note: As can be seen in Fig. 1, there are two methyl substituents in TPD, while two n-butyl substituents in the biphenyl-containing repeat unit of poly-TPD). Since both TPD and poly-TPD are tri-phenyl amine (TPA) derivatives, they have similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The HOMO and LUMO levels of TPD are 5.4eV and 2.3eV [3], respectively, and those of poly-TPD are 5.2eV and 2.3eV [10]. Therefore, similar optical properties, such as the formation of exciplexes with other molecules [9], are expected.As an effective hole transporting material in multilayer OLEDs [12], TPD has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically [7,13,14]. It is especially easy for TPD to form the exciplexes when TPD is brought into contact with electron-transporting-layer (ETL) molecules, such as 2-4-biphenyl-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) [7,15] and 2,5-bis (5-tert-butyl-2-benzoxazolyl) thiophene (BBOT) [3] to fabricate OLED devices with the bilayer TPD/PBD or TPD/BBOT. However, the optical properties of TPD are not often investigated in devices with single-layer TPD, due to the poor EL efficiency with the transport imbalance of holes and electrons. Recently, Nayak et al. have reported interesting EL performance of the OLED device with single-layer TPD [16]. In their studies, all of the emissions from monomers, excimers and electromers were observed in the device. Hong et al. [6] have also reported that the OLED device with single-layer doped-TPD has a different emission spectrum from the device with non-doped TPD. However, there are very few reports on the emission performance of the OLED devices with doped or non-doped single-layer poly-TPD.It is well known that an exciplex would be formed when poly-TPD is brought into contact with other molecules, especially electron transfer materials [17,18]. In this paper, we investigated the optical properties of poly-TPD when it comes in contact with 1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimida-zol-2-yl) benzene (TPBi, which is an excellent hole-blocking and electron transfer material). In order to get more insights into the nature of the emitting states of poly-TPD under the influence of an external electric field, OLED devices integrated with single-layer poly-TPD, bilayer poly-TPD/TPBi, or single-layer blended poly-TPD:TPBi were fabricated. Poly-TPD was used as an emissive layer for all of these devices. As a result, the different emission properties of poly-TPD in different local environments were obtained from the EL spectra. Clearer excimer emission peaks were observed in the device with bilayer poly-TPD/TPBi. In addition, it was also found that the intensity of electromer emission was higher for the device with TPBi-doped poly-TPD than non-doped poly-TPD. Both the origin of the optical phenomena and the effect of the doping ratio of TPBi on device performance were investigated.To investigate the origin of the optical phenomena and the effect of the doping ratio of TPBi on device performance, the following materials were used: poly-TPD (CAS: 472960-35-3) from HanFeng Chemical, TPBi (CAS: 192198-85-9) from Luminescence Chemical Engineering Technology Ltd, and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (CAS: 155090-83-8) from Heraeus. All organic materials were used without further purification. The poly-TPD solution (concentration: 15mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving poly-TPD in chloroform. The solutions of poly-TPD:TPBi blends with different weight ratios were also prepared using chloroform as the solvent. The ITO-coated glass substrates (with a sheet resistance of 15Ω/square) were cleaned with acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water in an ultrasonic bath and then treated with UV-ozone for 10min. The PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates and baked at 150°C in a vacuum oven for 10min to form a film with a thickness of 40nm. The poly-TPD and poly-TPD:TPBi blend solutions were spun on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and annealed at 110°C in a vacuum oven for 1h to form 40nm thick films, respectively.For the bilayer poly-TPD/TPBi device, TPBi film was deposited by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.2nm/s under a pressure of 2×10−4Pa, because the poly-TPD film would be destroyed if the TPBi film was formed by spin-coating using the same solution. Finally, a 100-nm thick Al electrode was deposited at a rate of 1nm/s under a pressure of 3×10−3Pa. The thicknesses and deposition rates of the deposited materials were measured in situ by quartz-crystal oscillator monitors. The effective area of the device was about 9mm2. The molecular structures of poly-TPD and TPBi are shown in Fig. 1. The structures of OLEDs used for this work are:Device Type 1: ITO/poly-TPD (15mg/ml-40nm)/Al (100nm).Device Type 2: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/poly-TPD (15mg/ml-40nm)/TPBi (40nm)/Al (100nm).Device Type 3: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/poly-TPD:TPBi (15mg/ml-40nm)/Al (100nm), using Poly-TPD:TPBi solutions with different weight ratios (1:1; 1.5:1; 2:1).Absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu-3101PC UV–Vis scanning spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were measured with Steady State and Transient State Fluorescence Spectrometer (LS-55). Electroluminescence spectra were measured with a charge-coupled device (CCD)-spectrometer (LPS-045, Lab sphere). All the measurements were carried out in air at room temperature without encapsulation.
