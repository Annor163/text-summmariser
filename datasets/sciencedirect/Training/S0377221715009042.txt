@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a way to optimally regulate bargaining for risk redistributions. We discuss the strategic interaction between two firms, who trade risk Over-The-Counter in a one-period model. Novel to the literature, we focus on an incomplete set of possible risk redistributions. This keeps the set of feasible contracts simple. We consider catastrophe and longevity risk as two key examples. The reason is that the trading of these risks typically occurs Over-The-Counter, and that there are no given pricing functions. If the set of feasible strategies is unconstrained, we get that all Nash equilibria are such that no firm benefits from trading. A way to avoid this, is to restrict the strategy space a priori. In this way, a Nash equilibrium that is interesting for both firms may exist. The intervention of a regulator is possible by restricting the set of feasible strategies. For instance, a firm has to keep a deductible on its prior risk. We characterize optimal regulation by means of Nash bargaining solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper studies bilateral bargaining for optimal risk redistributions. Firms can benefit from sharing risk if their risks are not perfectly correlated. We present a model that can be used in several fields, but its application is prominent for insurance risk. We focus on bilateral trading of Over-The-Counter (OTC) contracts. The firms bargain for a fair risk redistribution of the risk in their liabilities. Here, prices of derivatives do not exist. In this paper, we determine the prices implicitly via a bargaining process. This bargaining process reflects each firm’s alternatives to trade. When two counterparties meet, their bilateral relationship is strategic. Of key interest for a firm is how to determine their bargaining strategy.Firms are often enforced to hedge their risk by a regulator. A worst-case scenario should have relatively low consequences for the firm. This makes holding risky portfolios undesirable. So, firms want to reinsure themselves for losses in the tail of their risk distribution. This means that a part of the losses in the worst-case scenarios is sold to a reinsurer. A reinsurer typically asks a high risk premium to hedge the risk, meaning that the firms pay more than the expected payment that is determined by the contract. Therefore, firms could trade Over-The-Counter with each other. In this way, there is an opportunity to redistribute a part of their risk without paying a high risk premium.We consider catastrophe and longevity risk as two key examples. For both classes of insurance risk, firms cannot find an exchange market to buy a hedge against their exposure. Reinsurance contracts do exist, but the capacity of reinsurance is limited (see, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2013, for longevity risk). Also, the pricing of CAT-bonds and longevity-linked securities is very debatable. For this reason, these contracts are mainly traded Over-The-Counter. In this paper, we allow firms to have heterogeneous beliefs regarding the underlying probability distribution. This might increase the potential to benefit (see Boonen, De Waegenaere, & Norde, 2012).Cox and Lin (2007) suggest that pension funds and life insurers have a natural hedge in their systematic longevity risk exposure. This risk arises from the fact that the total population becomes older in a stochastic way. The liabilities of pension funds and life insurers are directly linked with longevity. For systematic risk, there is no diversification that weakens this risk, i.e., increasing the number of indemnity contracts is not sufficient. Blake, Cairns, and Dowd (2006) provide a detailed discussion on this. Exposure to systematic longevity risk can be rather substantial for pension funds as shown by e.g. Hári, De Waegenaere, Melenberg, and Nijman (2008). Firms can find a counterparty for trading a part of their longevity risk. If people systematically become older than expected, life insurers benefit while pension funds lose and vice versa. Therefore, their risks are typically negatively correlated (see, e.g., Tsai, Wang, & Tzeng, 2010; Wang, Huang, Yang, & Tsai, 2010), and, so, there might exist risk redistributions that are beneficial for both firms.We focus on the question how firms come to an agreement in bargaining for risk redistributions. We focus on the strategic behavior of the firms. We parameterize the strategic behavior of firms to redistribute their own risk. Firms use a specific standardized instrument as, for instance, CAT bonds (e.g., Cummins, 2008) for catastrophe risk and q-forwards (Coughlan, Epstein, Sinha, & Honig, 2007) for longevity risk. Alternatively, firms can design tailored instruments on the risk in their portfolio. As an example, we suggest that firms use the stop-loss rule, which is supported by e.g. Denuit and Vermandele (1998) and Goovaerts, Kaas, Van Heerwaarden, and Bauwelinckx (1990). This rule implies that the firm bears the risk up to a deductible. The rest is borne by the counterparty. Then, firms reinsure their worst-case stochastic losses.Using an insurance principle, firms are simultaneously proposing a redistribution of their own risk to the counterparty. The risk will be redistributed if both firms decide to accept after having observed each other’s strategy. Firms use an expected utility function to evaluate their future losses. We determine all Nash equilibria (Nash, 1950b) of this bargaining problem. Since there is complete information, one could expect that bargaining will result in a Pareto optimal outcome. However, we show that this does not need to be true. It is even the case that almost all Nash equilibria are such that the status quo will be retained.We provide a cooperative bargaining model to characterize optimal regulation. The regulator is allowed to make binding agreements regarding the possible strategies of the firms. A solution concept selects a strategy, which is enforced by mandating a firm to keep the corresponding part of its prior risk. We characterize the Nash bargaining solution (Nash, 1950a).There is also a stream in the literature that focus on non-cooperative sequential bargaining (Rubinstein, 1982). In an insurance–customer context as considered by Viaene, Veugelers, and Dedene (2002) and Huang, Huang, and Tzeng (2013), there is a natural order. In the first period, the insurance company makes an offer that involves charging the client a price for a coverage. The client then decides whether to accept the offer or not. If the client rejects, he/she can make a counter-proposal and so on. For bilateral bargaining for risk redistribution between firms, there is not a natural order of making a proposal. Also, as parties meet each other for OTC trading, the cost of waiting as in Rubinstein (1982), Viaene et al. (2002), and Huang et al. (2013) are negligible. Therefore, we assume that firms are participating in a simultaneous-move bargaining situation. Dutang, Albrecher, and Loisel (2013) study competition for insurance companies by Nash equilibria. They focus on the competition for policyholders with other insurance companies. We, however, focus on an insurer that reinsures its risk in its portfolio with another insurer, which could be a reinsurer.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the assumptions of the risk redistribution model. The Nash equilibria of this model are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, we characterize optimal regulation. Section 5 concludes this paper with a remark to generalize the assumptions of the bargaining problem.We consider a single-period economy. Throughout this paper, we impose the following assumptions.•The state space, denoted by Ω, is discrete. Note that we still allow Ω to be infinite.Both firms use a von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility function ui: IR → IR to evaluate their risk, withui′(·)>0andui′′(·)<0for all i ∈ {1, 2}. Firm i uses (subjective) probability measurePion the state space Ω. Since we consider a one-period model, discounting is redundant.Firm i ∈ {1, 2} possesses the risk Xi∈ L∞(Ω), that is Xiis measurable and bounded. It represents the future loss at a given future time.There is complete information about the risks, utility functions, and subjective probability measures.We use a static bargaining problem. The risks are evaluated at a given future time period. If firms bargain for Over-The-Counter trades in insurance risk, a potential drawback of this approach is that firms aim to agree on a redistribution of their liability risk over the complete run-off. Considering instead a shorter period to realize the trade, however, allows for the possibility to negotiate a new contract in the future. For example, firms can re-evaluate their portfolio according to new data, new regulations, and a new liability portfolio due to attrition and new insurance contracts.We allow the firms to use subjective probability measures; the subjective probability measure of firm i ∈ {1, 2} is given byPi,where we assume thatPi(ω)>0for all i ∈ {1, 2} and ω ∈ Ω. Different subjective probability measuresP1andP2lead to asymmetry in the beliefs of the underlying probability distribution. So, firms are allowed to “agree to disagree” on the probability measure. Wilson (1968) and Riddell (1981) discuss the use of heterogeneous subjective probability measures. Heterogeneous beliefs regarding the underlying probability distribution are due to the fact that there might be little consensus regarding the underlying distribution of catastrophe risk (see, e.g., Kunreuther, Meszaros, Hogarth, and Spranca, 1995, for earthquake insurance) and longevity risk (see, e.g., Blake et al., 2006). In Section 5, we provide more general assumptions on the preference functions such that the results in this paper remain valid.A way to redistribute risk is to add both risks and, then, redistribute this aggregated risk in a Pareto optimal way. Derived from Borch’s theorem (Borch, 1962; Gerber & Pafumi, 1998) characterize all Pareto optimal outcomes for a wide range of possible expected utility functions. Depending on the expected utility functions, there is a single parameter to bargain for. This parameter corresponds with a specific risk redistribution of the aggregate risk. It depends on individual risks only via their sum. Pooling the risk and then redistributing may lead to a complex reinsurance contract as it is written on the aggregate risk only. In contrast to this approach of Gerber and Pafumi (1998), we propose a structure in which we restrict the set of possible redistributions to account for the prior risks that firms possess. This contract is described by a parametric indemnity on the prior risk for every firm. A risk redistribution follows from parts of the prior risks that will be transferred to the other firm. We allow for a wide range of possible indemnity contracts.We parameterize (and so restrict) the functional form of posterior risks. A strategy for a firm is given by a proposal how to redistribute its own risk. In return, the firm expects a proposal from the other firm. We assume that a strategy of a firm is represented by a real number that directly corresponds with a redistribution of its own risk. We assume that Firm 1 can choose a parameter c and Firm 2 can choose a parameter d. So, parameterc∈Cindicates the part of X1 that is offered to Firm 2, and parameterd∈Dindicates the part of X2 that is offered to Firm 1. The joint strategy spaceC×Dwill be specified in Sections 3 and 4. A larger value of c or d corresponds to a smaller part of the risk that is offered to the other firm. Before bargaining, the functional form of posterior risks is common knowledge. The posterior risks are given byX1post(c,d),X2post(c,d)∈L∞(Ω),where (c, d) ∈ IR2, and are such that there is market clearing, i.e.,(1)X1post(c,d)+X2post(c,d)=X1+X2,for all (c, d) ∈ IR2. We impose the following assumptions on the parametric form of posterior risks.•There exists a strategy profile(c¯,d¯)∈IR+2such thatX1post(c¯,d¯)=X1andX2post(c¯,d¯)=X2.The functionsX1post(·,·)(ω)andX2post(·,·)(ω)are locally Lipschitz continuous, uniformly for all ω ∈ Ω.11Locally Lipschitz continuity ofX1post(·,·)(ω),uniformly for all ω ∈ Ω, is defined as follows. For all (c, d) ∈ IR2, there exists a neighborhood U of (c, d) and an m < ∞ such that|X1post(c,d)(ω)−X1post(c′,d′)(ω)|<m∥(c,d)−(c′,d′)∥for all (c′, d′) ∈ U and for all ω ∈ Ω.For any given(c^,d^)≤(c¯,d¯),X1post(·,d^)(ω)andX2post(c^,·)(ω)are increasing for all ω ∈ Ω and strictly increasing for some ω ∈ Ω on(−∞,c¯]resp.(−∞,d¯].For any given(c^,d^)∈IR2,there exist states ω, ω′ ∈ Ω such thatlimc→−∞X1post(c,d^)(ω)=limd→−∞X2post(c^,d)(ω′)=−∞.For vectors a, b ∈ IR2, we define a ≤ b as an element-wise inequality, i.e., a1 ≤ b1 and a2 ≤ b2. Moreover, a < b implies a1 < b1 and a2 < b2, and a≨b implies a1 ≤ b1 and a2 ≤ b2 where at least one inequality is strict. Moreover, we defineIR+2={x∈IR2:x≥0}andIR++2={x∈IR2:x>0}.A market is called complete if every contract on the state space Ω can be traded. In this paper, we do not allow any possible reinsurance contract. The parametrization of the posterior risks generates market incompleteness. However, (re)insurance markets are typically incomplete, as argued by Schlesinger and Doherty (1985).The expected utility functions are given by:(2)U1(c,d)=EP1[u1(−X1post(c,d))],and(3)U2(c,d)=EP2[u2(−X2post(c,d))],for all(c,d)∈(−∞,c¯]×(−∞,d¯],whereEPidenotes the expectation under the probability distributionPi. So, the utility levelUi(c¯,d¯)corresponds to the prior expected utility level for firm i. We show in the appendix (Lemmas B.1and B.2) that the expected utility functions U1 and U2 are strictly monotonic and continuous.The parametric form to redistribute risk can be formulated via specific investment instruments (e.g., CAT-bonds for catastrophe risk and q-forwards for longevity risk). In the following example, we provide three key ways to construct tailored posterior risksX1post(c,d)andX2post(c,d)that satisfy the properties stated above.Example 2.1In this example, we assume that for all i ∈ {1, 2} there exists a state ω ∈ Ω such that Xi(ω) > 0.A commonly used principle in insurance is the stop-loss principle. Stop-loss reinsurance is popular in practice and is supported by, e.g., Denuit and Vermandele (1998) and Goovaerts et al. (1990). For the strategy profile (c, d) ∈ IR2, we have that Firm 1 keeps min {X1, c} and offersmax{X1−c,0}to Firm 2, and Firm 2 keeps min {X2, d} and offersmax{X2−d,0}to Firm 1. Thus, the posterior risks are given byX1post(c,d)=min{X1,c}+max{X2−d,0},andX2post(c,d)=min{X2,d}+max{X1−c,0},for all (c, d) ∈ IR2. Locally Lipschitz continuity ofX1post(·,d)andX2post(c,·)is shown in Appendix A. It is easy to show that the stop-loss rule satisfies all properties that are introduced for the posterior risks. Ifc>supX1,the proposal of Firm 1 is always to keep its risk and, so, this strategy is identical toc¯=supX1. Similarly, we haved¯=supX2. Moreover, as retaining less than the original risk is generally not allowed, the strategy profile (0, 0) is a natural minimum of the joint strategy space.It is also possible that firms use a proportional rule. This rule states that the firms keep a given percentage of their risk. Lampaert and Walhin (2005) show that stop-loss treaties in reinsurance are often hard to price and might lead to moral hazard behavior from the insurer. Therefore, these authors support the proportional treaty.For every strategy profile (c, d) ∈ IR2, we have that Firm 1 keepsmin{X1,0}+cmax{X1,0}and offers(1−c)max{X1,0}to Firm 2, and Firm 2 keepsmin{X2,0}+dmax{X2,0}and offers(1−d)max{X2,0}to Firm 1. So, the posterior risks are given byX1post(c,d)=min{X1,0}+cmax{X1,0}+(1−d)max{X2,0},andX2post(c,d)=min{X2,0}+(1−c)max{X1,0}+dmax{X2,0},for all (c, d) ∈ IR2. Negative losses (i.e., gains) are not traded since, otherwise,X1post(·,d)andX2post(c,·)may not be increasing. Locally Lipschitz continuity is again shown in Appendix A. It is easy to show that the proportional rule satisfies all properties that are introduced above. Retaining one’s own risk corresponds with the strategy profile(c¯,d¯)=(1,1). The strategy profile (0, 0) is a natural minimum of the joint strategy space.Alternatively, firms can also use a mixture of parametric forms to redistribute their own risk. Moreover, we allow firms to use different parametric forms. For instance, we allow that one firm uses a stop-loss rule and the other firm uses a proportional rule. Alternatively, one can let the parametric form of one firm be a risk-free payment, i.e.,X1post(c,d¯)=X1−(c¯−c)for all c ∈ IR. Then, Firm 1 is buying risk from Firm 2. If risks X1 and X2 are independent, it is optimal for Firm 2 to use a stop-loss parametric form (Goovaerts et al., 1990). Then, the corresponding bargaining problem is in line with Kihlstrom and Roth (1982), Schlesinger (1984), and Quiggin and Chambers (2009), who all study cooperative bargaining for an insurance contract between a client and an insurer. We can normalizec¯≥0in any way.In this section, we show the Nash equilibria of the risk redistribution bargaining problem. We fix the joint strategy spaceC×D⊂(−∞,c¯]×(−∞,d¯]with(c¯,d¯)∈C×D. So, for a given parametric form of the posterior risks, we fix the upper bound of the joint strategy spaceC×D. For a firm, this upper bound strategy corresponds with proposing to keep its own risk. The strategy space might be based on requirements of a regulator, which we discuss in Section 4.In this paper, both firms agree on a risk redistribution after non-cooperative bargaining. When firms bargain, they maximize their own expected utility, and, so, a Pareto optimal risk redistribution does not need to be agreed upon (see, e.g., the Prisoner’s Dilemma). Firms select a risk redistribution based on a two-stage bargaining process. In the first stage, firms make simultaneously a proposal for a redistribution of their own risk. Then, the firms observe each other’s bid and decide individually whether the deal is accepted. A deal goes through only if both firms accept. A firm accepts the deal if its expected utility weakly increases. If one firm rejects, the deal is canceled and both firms keep their prior risks. So, the objective of firm i ∈ {1, 2} is to maximize Ui(c, d) subject to the constraintsU1(c,d)≥U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c,d)≥U2(c¯,d¯). If a constraint is violated, one firm will cancel the deal in the second stage. This leads to the following ex post expected utility functions:(4)U˜1(c,d)={U1(c,d)ifU1(c,d)≥U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c,d)≥U2(c¯,d¯),U1(c¯,d¯)otherwise,and(5)U˜2(c,d)={U2(c,d)ifU2(c,d)≥U2(c¯,d¯)andU1(c,d)≥U1(c¯,d¯),U2(c¯,d¯)otherwise,for all(c,d)∈C×D.The best response correspondence for Firm 1, denoted bybr1:D→C,is given by(6)br1(d)=argmaxc∈CU˜1(c,d),for alld∈D. For Firm 2, we have(7)br2(c)=argmaxd∈DU˜2(c,d),for allc∈C. Note that br1 and br2 can be empty.In a Nash equilibrium, both firms have selected one of the best responses to the other firm’s strategy (Nash, 1950b). So,(c^,d^)∈C×Dis a Nash equilibrium if and only if it holds thatc^∈br1(d^)andd^∈br2(c^),i.e., the set of Nash equilibria is given by:(8)NE={(c,d)∈C×D|c∈br1(d),d∈br2(c)}.In order to show some Nash equilibria, we first define the set of strategies of a firm for which there is no possibility to strictly benefit for the counterparty. We define the setNC⊆Cas(9)NC={c∈C|∀d∈D:U˜2(c,d)=U2(c¯,d¯)}.Similarly, we define the setND⊆Das(10)ND={d∈D|∀c∈C:U˜1(c,d)=U1(c¯,d¯)}.For allc∈NC,there is no responsed∈Dfor Firm 2 that yields a strict improvement for itself. This leads to the following result.Proposition 3.1Every strategy profile inNC×NDis a Nash equilibrium.Note that for every(c^,d^)∈NC×ND,we have thatU˜1(c^,d^)=U1(c¯,d¯)andU˜2(c^,d^)=U2(c¯,d¯). So, all strategy profiles inNC×NDare of no interest for the firms. Nevertheless, Proposition 3.1 states that all strategy profiles inNC×NDare Nash equilibria. In the proof of the next corollary, we show that(c¯,d¯)∈NC×NDand, so, the subsequent result follows from Proposition 3.1.Corollary 3.2The strategy profile(c¯,d¯)is a Nash equilibrium.This corollary states that keeping your risk is a Nash equilibrium.Theorem 3.3If the strategy spaceCorDhas no minimum, the set of Nash equilibria is given byNE=NC×ND.Theorem 3.3 states that it is necessary to agree a priori on that the strategy spacesCandDhave no minima. Otherwise, both firms do not benefit in any Nash equilibrium. For instance, if the firms use the joint strategy spaceC×D=(−∞,c¯]×(−∞,d¯],every Nash equilibrium is inNC×ND. The Nash equilibria are in line with the Prisoner’s Dilemma, in the sense that both firms do not benefit optimally. By maximizing their own expected utility, the firms are likely to retain the status quo. This is in line with the Bertrand paradox (Bertrand, 1883) in which firms set the price for a product equal to the marginal cost in the only Nash equilibrium. So, both firms do not benefit in the market in order to obtain the whole market share.In the rest of this paper, we assume thatCandDare closed and bounded intervals, hence have a minimum. Then, we can definec̲=minCandd̲=minD. SinceCandDare compact, we have that br1 and br2 map every element of their domain to a non-empty subset. We will show that it might be possible for both firms to strictly benefit in a Nash equilibrium if the lower boundscanddare wisely chosen.Before we provide the best response correspondences, we need the following result.Lemma 3.4For alld∈D,there exists a uniquec*∈(−∞,c¯]such thatU2(c*,d)=U2(c¯,d¯). Likewise, for allc∈C,there exists a uniqued*∈(−∞,d¯]such thatU1(c,d*)=U1(c¯,d¯).According to Lemma 3.4, we are allowed to define the functionsc*:D→(−∞,c¯]andd*:C→(−∞,d¯]as the functions satisfyingU2(c*(d),d)=U2(c¯,d¯)for alld∈D,andU1(c,d*(c))=U1(c¯,d¯)for allc∈C. The functions c* and d* are the responses of a firm such that the other firm is indifferent compared to the status quo. Note that possiblyc*(d)∉C. We provide the best response correspondences in the following proposition.Proposition 3.5The best response for Firm 1 to a strategyd∈Dis given bybr1(d)={Cifd∈ND,{max{c̲,c*(d)}}ifd∈(ND)c,and the best response for Firm 2 to a strategyc∈Cis given bybr2(c)={Difc∈NC,{max{d̲,d*(c)}}ifc∈(NC)c,where br1and br2are defined in(6)and(7),NCandNDare defined in(9)and(10), and(NC)c=C∖NCand(ND)c=D∖ND.If br1(d) and br2(c) are singleton-valued, we write them as functions. So, we writebr1(d)=max{c̲,c*(d)}ford∈(ND)candbr2(c)=max{d̲,d*(c)}forc∈(NC)c.Proposition 3.6The correspondence br1is continuous and increasing on(ND)cand the correspondence br2is continuous and increasing on(NC)c.The set of strategies where both firms strictly benefit is given by:(11){(c,d)∈C×D|U˜1(c,d)>U1(c¯,d¯),U˜2(c,d)>U2(c¯,d¯)}.Next, we present an important result for the Nash equilibria of the risk redistribution bargaining problem.Theorem 3.7There exists at most one Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)∈NEsuch thatU˜1(c^,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯). If it exists, it satisfiesd^=d̲. Likewise, there exists at most one Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)∈NEsuch thatU˜2(c^,d^)>U2(c¯,d¯). If it exists, it satisfiesc^=c̲.Note that if Firm 2 uses a stop-loss or proportional rule as parametric form to redistribute its risk and ifd̲=0,the strategyd^=d̲=0implies that Firm 2 proposes to swap all positive losses of its risk. This strategy might, however, lead to the only Nash equilibrium in which at least one firm strictly benefits. We will show in Example 3.11 a risk redistribution bargaining problem in which there exists a Nash equilibrium in which one firm strictly benefits.Next, we define the functionf:C×D→C×Das follows:(12)f(c,d)={(c,d)if(c,d)∈((NC)c×(ND)c)∪(NC×ND),(c,d*(c))if(c,d)∈(NC)c×ND,(c*(d),d)if(c,d)∈NC×(ND)c,for all(c,d)∈C×D. The following result is deduced from Theorem 3.7.Corollary 3.8There is at most one Nash equilibrium in which at least one firm strictly benefits. If existent, this Nash equilibrium is given by strategy profile f(c,d), which is defined in(12).If both firms strictly benefit in strategy profile (c,d), thenf(c̲,d̲)=(c̲,d̲)∈(br1(d̲),br2(c̲)). We next show that f(c,d) is always a Nash equilibrium. More general, if(c̲,d̲)∉(NC)c×(ND)c,the strategy profile f(c,d) is the unique Nash equilibrium in which at least one firm strictly benefits from OTC trading as shown in the following theorem.Theorem 3.9The set of Nash equilibria is given byNE=(NC×ND)∪{f(c̲,d̲)}.From (12), we directly getf(c,d)=(c¯,d¯)if and only if(c,d)=(c¯,d¯). From this, Corollary 3.2 and Theorem 3.9, it follows directly that the set NE is singleton-valued if and only if the strategy spaceC×Dis singleton-valued. Generally, the set of Nash equilibria NE can be large. Therefore, we consider a popular refinement of Nash equilibria. If there exist multiple Nash equilibria, firms prefer the Nash equilibria that are Pareto optimal. The notion of Pareto optimality is used in a constrained sense, i.e., Nash equilibria are required to be Pareto optimal among all alternatives that are also Nash equilibria. The set of all Pareto optimal Nash equilibria (Kurz & Hart, 1982) is defined as:(13)PONE={(c,d)∈NE|¬∃(c′,d′)∈NE:(Ui(c′,d′))i∈{1,2}≩Ui(c,d))i∈{1,2}},where the set NE is defined in (8). From Corollary 3.8, we get that if there exists a Nash equilibrium in which at least one firm strictly benefits, there is a unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium, given by f(c,d). The following corollary follows directly from this and Theorem 3.9.Corollary 3.10The set PONE, defined in(13), is given byPONE={{f(c̲,d̲)}if(c̲,d̲)∉NC×ND,NC×NDotherwise.Note that ifPONE=NC×ND,there are no welfare gains in any Nash equilibrium.Remark that the results in Proposition 3.5, Theorems 3.7,3.9, Corollaries 3.8 and 3.10 are sensitive to the assumption of convexity of the joint strategy spaceC×D. For instance, ifC×Dis finite, it may be possible to find other Nash equilibria in which at least one firm strictly benefits.The following example illustrates the set PONE in a setting with two catastrophe insurers.Example 3.11In this example, we illustrate the risk redistribution model with an application in catastrophe reinsurance. Suppose there are two types of catastrophes, Type 1 and Type 2. Firm 1 sells insurance contracts that depend on catastrophe Type 1, and Firm 2 sells insurance contracts that depend on catastrophe Type 2. If catastrophe Type 1 occurs, Firm 1 bears a cost of 1 unit. Firm 1 believes that this event occurs with probability 2 percent and Firm 2 believes that this event occurs with probability 1 percent. Firm 2 bears a cost of 1 unit if catastrophe Type 2 occurs. Moreover, Firm 1 believes that this event occurs with probability 0.5 percent and Firm 2 believes that this event occurs with probability 1 percent. The events Type 1 and Type 2 are independent. Let the firms use an exponential utility function with constant absolute risk aversion parameter λi> 0, i.e., for all i ∈ {1, 2}, we haveui(x)=−exp(−λix)for all x ∈ IR. Letλ1=λ2=1. Since we can formulate the state space Ω as a set with four states of the world, we can write the probability measures and the risks as vectors:P1=[0.97510.00490.01990.0001],P2=[0.98010.00990.00990.0001],X1=[0011],andX2=[0101].We also assume that the firms use a stop-loss function to redistribute their own risk and, for now,c̲=d̲=0. As shown in Example 2.1, we havec¯=d¯=1.Fig. 1displays the best response correspondences. We obtain from this figure that the set of Nash equilibria is given byNE={(0,0),(0,1),(1,1)}. Firms are not trading in all except one Nash equilibria. Only in the equilibrium strategy profilef(0,0)=(c*(0),0)=(0,0),there is a risk redistribution. In this Nash equilibrium, Firm 2 is indifferent compared to the status quo and Firm 1 strictly benefits. So, we getPONE={(0,0)}. Remark that in this equilibrium both firms swap their risks.If the firms are forced to obey a given lower bound of the joint strategy spaceC×D,firms can benefit altogether. For instance, in Example 3.11, it follows from Fig. 1 that c*(0.5) < 0.5, d*(0.5) < 0.5. From this and strict monotonicity of U1 and U2 (see Lemma B.1), it follows that it is beneficial for both firms to set the lower bounds atc̲=d̲=0.5. Then,C=D=[0.5,1],and the strategy profilef(0.5,0.5)=(0.5,0.5)is the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. Characterizing the “optimal” values forcanddis non-trivial. We discuss this problem in Section 4.In this section, we study optimal regulation. A regulator has the point of view of a social planner, aiming to optimize welfare of both firms. It can enforce an attractive Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium by restricting the joint strategy space. In the previous sections we showed that myopically maximizing own utility on the joint strategy space(−∞,c¯]×(−∞,d¯]leads to undesirable Nash equilibria, since firms are trying to trump their opponent. We assume that a regulator can enforce the lower bounds of the strategy spacesCandD. Firms can be enforced to have a minimal ownership of their own insurance contracts. This prevents moral hazard behavior of a firm. The regulator uses a cooperative bargaining model22Cooperative bargaining models were first introduced by Nash (1950a) for the case where two agents bargain for a redistribution of goods, using utility levels.to determine optimal lower bounds of the strategy spaces.We assume that the set of possible lower bounds is compact and convex. Without loss of generality, we let the domain of possible lower bounds (c,d) be given by the space[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]. If the firms use a stop-loss or a proportional rule to redistribute their risk, it seems natural to assume thatc,d≥0 (see Example 2.1).33For the stop-loss and proportional parametric form setting the lower bounds at zero impliesX1post(0,d¯)=min{X1,0}andX2post(c¯,0)=min{X2,0}. Remark that we are still allowed to translate the parametric form in any way; for the stop-loss parametric form we could for example let:X1post(c,d¯)=min{X1,c−δ}for any δ ∈ IR and for all c ≥ 0.For every strategy profile(c,d)≤(c¯,d¯),we define(14)ΔUi(c,d)=Ui(c,d)−Ui(c¯,d¯),as the excess expected utility for firm i ∈ {1, 2}. The regulator enforces the vector of lower bounds(c̲,d̲)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]such that ΔU(c,d) > 0. Then, we get from (12) and Corollary 3.10 thatPONE={f(c̲,d̲)}={(c̲,d̲)}.We define the admissible areaAof joint excess expected utility levels by:(15)A={a∈IR2|∃(c,d)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]:a≤ΔU(c,d)}.In cooperative bargaining, the disagreement point is the vector of utility levels attained when there is no agreement. As normalization, we look at excess expected utilities and, so, the disagreement point is given by the vectorΔU(c¯,d¯)=(0,0).If we compare this with the bargaining set of Nash (1950a), we differ by considering an incomplete market for possible risk redistributions. In a complete market, every market clearing risk redistribution can be obtained (also called an Arrow–Debreu market). In this way, the admissible area of excess expected utility levels would only depend on the individual risks Xi, i ∈ {1, 2} via their sumX1+X2. This leads to a contract written on realizations of the risk of a firm and its counterparty jointly (cf. Borch, 1962; Gerber & Pafumi, 1998; Wilson, 1968). The setAis a subset of the bargaining set defined by Boonen et al. (2012), in which any market clearing risk redistribution is allowed.Next, we state a popular definition of a cooperative bargaining problem (see, e.g., van Damme, 1986).Definition 4.1A cooperative bargaining problem is a set A ⊂ IR2 that satisfies the following conditions:(i)A is convex and comprehensive44A set A is called comprehensive if x ∈ A implies y ∈ A for all y ≤ x.;A∩IR+2is non-empty and compact.The class of cooperative bargaining problems is denoted by Σ.In a cooperative bargaining problem, the aim is to determine an element of the setA,defined in (15), that is perceived as “fair” by both firms.Proposition 4.2The setAis convex if both firms use the proportional rule as parametric form to redistribute their risk, or if one firm uses the proportional rule and one firm a risk-free payment.Also if firms use standardized investment products with non-negative pay-off in all states, we can show that the setAis convex. For the stop-loss parametric form, it is possible to construct an example where the setAis not convex. For now, we assume that the setAis convex.Proposition 4.3If the setAis convex, it is a cooperative bargaining problem.If the strategy profile (0, 0) is Pareto optimal, the firms cannot benefit altogether. Then, no trade is Pareto optimal. In the sequel, we exclude the trivial case where the element (0, 0) is Pareto optimal.Proposition 4.4If the element (0, 0) of the cooperative bargaining problemAis Pareto dominated, there exists ana∈Asuch that a > 0.A bargaining solution Φ maps every cooperative bargaining problem in Σ to an element of A, i.e., it is such that Φ(A) ∈ A for all A ∈ Σ. According to Proposition 4.4, there exists a bargaining solution in which both firms strictly benefit.Definition 4.5The Nash bargaining solution for risk redistribution bargaining problems is given byNB(A)=argmaxx∈A∩IR+2x1x2,where the bargaining problemAis defined in (15).Singleton-valuedness of the Nash bargaining solution is guaranteed by the fact that the setA∩IR+2is closed and convex (Nash, 1950a). Since the Nash bargaining solution is Pareto optimal, there exists a strategy profile(c^,d^)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]such thatΔU(c^,d^)=NB(A),where ΔU is defined in (14). This profile is not necessarily unique. SinceΔU(c^,d^)>0(see Proposition 4.4), the strategy profilef(c^,d^)=(c^,d^)is the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium if the regulator imposes the lower boundsc̲=c^andd̲=d^(see Theorem 3.9). Hence, we only consider solutions in the setA∩IR++2,which is non-empty for all relevant cases (see Proposition 4.4).We support the Nash bargaining solution based on the following four properties for a bargaining solution Φ:•Invariance with respect to positive affine transformations (INV): for any pairA,A˜∈Σ,if there is a strictly increasing linear function h such thatA˜=h(A),thenΦ(A˜)=h(Φ(A)).Strict individual rationality (SIR): for any A ∈ Σ, Φ(A) > 0.Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): for any pairA,A˜∈Σsuch thatA⊂A˜,ifΦ(A˜)∈A,thenΦ(A)=Φ(A˜).Symmetry (SYM): let T: IR2 → IR2 be given byT(x,y)=(y,x). Then,T(Φ(A))=Φ(T(A))for every A ∈ Σ.The property (INV) ensures that if utility functions yield exactly the same preferences due to affine transformations of the utility function, the bargaining rule is the same for both utility functions. The property (SIR) ensures that both firms are better off than when they do not trade. The property (IIA) resembles a gradual elimination of unacceptable outcomes. Eliminated outcomes in the cooperative bargaining problemAhave no effect on the bargaining solution. The property (SYM) ensures that if firms are indistinguishable in a certain cooperative bargaining problem, the bargaining solution should not discriminate between them. For an extensive discussion of the four properties, we refer to Osborne and Rubinstein (1994). The following result is shown by Nash (1950a).Theorem 4.6There exists a unique bargaining solution Φ satisfying the properties (INV), (SIR), (IIA), and (SYM). This rule is given byΦ(A)=NB(A)for all A ∈ Σ.Note that we only need convexity of the setA∩IR+2. If the setA∩IR+2is not convex, there exists a popular generalization of the Nash bargaining solution characterized by Conley and Wilkie (1996). For a discussion of this generalized Nash bargaining solution in insurance bargaining, we refer to Li, Xiao, and Yao (2013).Instead of choosing the lower bounds of the joint strategy space wisely, Rubinstein (1982) designs a bilateral bargaining process in which if firms are perfectly patient, the unique Nash equilibrium converges to the Nash bargaining solution. Moreover, van Damme (1986) shows that the Nash bargaining solution constitutes the unique equilibrium if two firms have different opinions about the appropriate solution concept. Alternatively, in line with, e.g., (Aase, 2009; Banerjee, Güçbilmez, & Pawlina, 2014; Boonen et al., 2012; Kihlstrom & Roth, 1982; Quiggin & Chambers, 2009; Schlesinger, 1984; Zhou, Li, & Tan, 2015), we could assume that firms behave cooperatively and, therefore, select the Nash bargaining solution based on abovementioned properties. In this paper, we study non-cooperative bargaining of firms that leads to a cooperative bargaining solution determined by the regulator.Example 4.7In this example, we return to the risk redistribution bargaining problem described in Example 3.11. We display the setA,defined in (15), in Fig. 2. We get that the setAis convex and, thus, a cooperative bargaining problem. We obtain that the Nash bargaining solution corresponds uniquely with strategy profile (c,d) ≈ (0.41, 0). So, the regulator should enforce Firm 1 to keep a deductible of 0.41 units. From this it follows that if the joint strategy space is given byC×D=[0.41,1]×[0,1],the posterior risks corresponding to the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium are given by(16)X1post(c̲,d̲)≈[010.411.41],andX2post(c̲,d̲)≈[000.590.59].Firm 2 offers in the Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium its full risk to Firm 1. It gets offered a large part of the risk of Firm 1. For firm i ∈ {1, 2}, the zero utility premium relative to the expected value of its prior risk is defined as the value pi∈ IR such that(17)EPi[ui(−Xipost(c̲,d̲)−piEPi[Xi])]=Ui(c¯,d¯).Since uiis continuous and strictly increasing, andEPi[Xi]>0,this value piexists, and is unique by the intermediate value theorem. The zero utility premium of the risk redistribution in (16) for Firm 1 is approximately 76 percent of the expected value of its prior risk. Moreover, for Firm 2, the zero utility premium is approximately 90 percent of the expected value of its prior risk. Moreover, we study the reduction in expected value, which is given by(18)EPi[Xi]−EPi[Xipost(c̲,d̲)]EPi[Xi],for all i ∈ {1, 2}. For Firm 1, the expected value of the risk after risk redistribution decreases with approximately 34 percent of the prior expected value. For Firm 2, the expected value of the risk after risk redistribution decreases with approximately 41 percent of the prior expected value. Note that these percentages do not need to add up to zero when the beliefs regarding the underlying distribution function are not the same.In Tables 1 and 2, we display the effects of different beliefs regarding the underlying probability distribution. We find that if both firms believe that the probability of the Type 1 event is the same as the probability of the Type 2 event, the optimal deductible for both firms equalsc̲=d̲=0.5in the Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. In this situation, the aggregate risk will be shared with equal proportions, i.e., we haveX1post(0.5,0.5)=X2post(0.5,0.5)=12(X1+X2). Moreover, we get from Tables 1 and 2 that if firms have heterogeneous beliefs, they generally believe that they gain in expected value. Moreover, Firm 2 benefits more in terms of the zero-utility premium if Firm 1 assigns a higher probability to the Type 1 event, and a lower probability to the Type 2 event. These two effects both lead to a situation in which Firm 1 is more willing to trade, and it is therefore willing to compensate Firm 2 more.In Table 3, we display the effects of risk aversion. We find that when one firm is more risk averse, this firm bears more risk after trading. This observation is in line with Kihlstrom and Roth (1982) and Schlesinger (1984). Moreover, if the two firms are more risk averse altogether, the firms will trade less. In this case, less trade will mitigate the riskiness of the posterior risks. When firms are more risk averse, this effect is stronger compared to the effect of using different probability measures. As expected, the zero-utility premium is significantly higher when firms are more risk-averse.In this concluding remark, we propose a generalization of the results in this paper. The results in this paper remain valid if we only impose the some conditions on the utility functions U1: IR2 → IR and U2: IR2 → IR. Then, there is not necessarily a risk redistribution problem, but a bargaining problem of finding the strategy profiles (c, d) ∈ IR2 corresponding to the Pareto optimal Nash equilibria. A strategy of Firm 1 is still a proposal of parameter c, and Firm 2 proposes a parameter d. If a firm i ∈ {1, 2} is worse off than in the status quo, the deal is canceled. We impose the following conditions on the general utility functions U1: IR2 → IR and U2: IR2 → IR.•There is complete information about Ui, i ∈ {1, 2}.There exists a(c¯,d¯)∈IR2such thatUi(c¯,d¯),i∈{1,2}is the status quo.For everyd≤d¯,the utility function U1( ·, d) is strictly decreasing and, for everyc≤c¯,the utility function U1(c, ·) is strictly increasing. Likewise, for everyd≤d¯,the utility function U2( ·, d) is strictly increasing and, for everyc≤c¯,the utility function U2(c, ·) is strictly decreasing.The utility functions U1 and U2 are continuous.For every(c^,d^)∈IR2,it holds thatlimc→−∞U2(c,d^)=limd→−∞U1(c^,d)=−∞.For instance, preferences based on dual utility (see, e.g., Yaari, 1987) satisfy these conditions if we use the same parametrization of the posterior risk profiles as described in Section 2. Also, the results in this paper remain valid if we include ambiguity aversion via, e.g., maxmin expected utility functions as in Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989).First, we show that the stop-loss rule is locally Lipschitz continuous, uniformly for all ω ∈ Ω. It is sufficient to show this only for Firm 1. Local Lipschitz continuity follows from|X1post(c,d)(ω)−X1post(c′,d′)(ω)|=|(min{X1(ω),c}+max{X2(ω)−d,0})−(min{X1(ω),c′}+max{X2(ω)−d′,0})|≤|min{X1(ω),c}−min{X1(ω),c′}|+|max{X2(ω)−d,0}−max{X2(ω)−d′,0}|≤|c−c′|+|d−d′|≤2∥(c,d)−(c′,d′)∥,for all (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈ IR2 and for all ω ∈ Ω.Second, we show that the proportional rule is locally Lipschitz continuous, uniformly for all ω ∈ Ω. This follows from|X1post(c,d)(ω)−X1post(c′,d′)(ω)|=|min{X1(ω),0}+cmax{X1(ω),0}−dmax{X2(ω),0}−(min{X1(ω),0}+c′max{X1(ω),0}−d′max{X2(ω),0})|≤|cmax{X1(ω),0}−c′max{X1(ω),0}|+|dmax{X2(ω),0}−d′max{X2(ω),0}|≤|c−c′|max{X1(ω),0}+|d−d′|max{X2(ω),0}≤|c−c′|supX1+|d−d′|supX2≤(|c−c′|+|d−d′|)sup{X1,X2}≤2sup{X1,X2}∥(c,d)−(c′,d′)∥,for all (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈ IR2 and for all ω ∈ Ω.First, we show two properties that the expected utility functions Ui, i ∈ {1, 2} satisfy. These properties are widely used in the proofs of Section 3.Lemma B.1For everyd≤d¯,the function U1( ·, d) is strictly decreasing and, for everyc≤c¯,the function U1(c, ·) is strictly increasing. Likewise, for everyd≤d¯,the function U2( ·, d) is strictly increasing and, for everyc≤c¯,the function U2(c, ·) is strictly decreasing.We show this result only for Firm 1. Letd^≤d¯andc^,c^′such thatc^<c^′≤c¯. Then, it holds thatX1post(c^,d^)(ω)≤X1post(c^′,d^)(ω)for all ω ∈ Ω with at least one strict inequality for some ω ∈ Ω. This implies that for every strictly increasing utility function we haveu1(−X1post(c^,d^)(ω))≥u1(−X1post(c^′,d^)(ω))for all ω ∈ Ω with at least one strict inequality for some ω ∈ Ω. SinceP1(ω)>0for all ω ∈ Ω, we obtain thatU1(c^,d^)>U1(c^′,d^)if we take expectations. Hence,U1(·,d^)is strictly decreasing. Likewise, we can show thatU1(c^,·)is strictly increasing for everyc^≤c¯.□The expected utility functions U1and U2are continuous.We show the result only for the expected utility function U1. Let(c^,d^)≤(c¯,d¯)and δ > 0. Since the riskX1post(c¯,d¯)=X1is bounded and sinceX1post(·,·)(ω)is continuous for all ω ∈ Ω, it follows that for any given(c,d)≤(c¯,d¯)the risksX1post(c,d)is bounded as well. So, there exists an Mδ< ∞ such thatX1post(c′,d′)<Mδfor all(c′,d′)≤(c¯,d¯)such that∥(c′,d′)−(c^,d^)∥<δ. Letmδ=|u1′(−Mδ)|<∞. Then, sinceu1′(·)>0,we have|u1′(−X1post(c′,d′))|≤mδ,for all(c′,d′)≤(c¯,d¯)such that∥(c′,d′)−(c^,d^)∥<δ.By assumption, it holds thatX1post(·,·)(ω)is locally Lipschitz continuous, uniformly for all ω ∈ Ω. Consequently, we have thatX1post(·,·)(ω)is Lipschitz continuous on every compact subset of(−∞,c¯]×(−∞,d¯]. So, for every δ > 0, there exists anm˜δ<∞such that|X1post(c^,d^)(ω)−X1post(c′,d′)(ω)|<m˜δ∥(c^,d^)−(c′,d′)∥for all(c′,d′)≤(c¯,d¯)such that∥(c^,d^)−(c′,d′)∥<δand for all ω ∈ Ω.Let ε > 0 and denoteδ=min{ɛm1m˜1,1}. Then, for all(c′,d′)≤(c¯,d¯)such that∥(c′,d′)−(c^,d^)∥<δ,we have(19)|U1(c′,d′)−U1(c^,d^)|=|∑ω∈ΩP1(ω)(u1(−X1post(c′,d′)(ω))−u1(−X1post(c^,d^)(ω)))|≤∑ω∈ΩP1(ω)|u1(−X1post(c′,d′)(ω))−u1(−X1post(c^,d^)(ω))|(20)≤m1∑ω∈ΩP1(ω)|−X1post(c′,d′)(ω)+X1post(c^,d^)(ω)|<m1m˜1∥−(c′,d′)+(c^,d^)∥∑ω∈ΩP1(ω)=m1m˜1∥−(c′,d′)+(c^,d^)∥<m1m˜1δ≤ɛ,where (19) follows from the triangular inequality and (20) follows from the mean value theorem. This concludes the proof.□Next, we continue with the proofs of the results in the main text.Proof of Proposition 3.1Let(c^,d^)∈NC×ND. Sincec^∈NC,we get from the definition ofNCin (9) thatU˜2(c^,d)=U2(c¯,d¯)for alld∈D. So, all responses inDyield the same posterior expected utility for Firm 2. Therefore, everyd∈Dis a best response and, so,br2(c^)=D. Thus,d^∈br2(c^). Likewise, we havebr1(d^)=Cand, so,c^∈br1(d^). Hence,(c^,d^)is a Nash equilibrium. This concludes the proof.□According to Proposition 3.1, it is sufficient to show that(c¯,d¯)∈NC×ND. Since U2( ·, d) is strictly increasing (Lemma B.1), we haveU2(c,d¯)<U2(c¯,d¯)for allc<c¯. Therefore, everyc∈Csuch thatc<c¯as a response tod¯will be rejected by Firm 2. So, we haveU˜2(c,d¯)=U2(c¯,d¯)for allc∈C. Consequently, we get from the definition ofNDin (10) thatd¯∈ND. Similarly, we can show thatc¯∈NC. This concludes the proof.□First, we show that every Nash equilibrium is inNC×NDif the strategy spaceDhas no minimum.Let the strategy profile(c^,d^)be a Nash equilibrium such thatd^∈ND. Then, it holds thatU˜1(c^,d^)=U1(c¯,d¯). Supposec^∈(NC)c. Then, it follows from the definition ofNCin (9) that there exists a responsed*∈Dsuch thatU˜2(c^,d*)>U2(c¯,d¯). Then, we get from the definition ofU˜2in (5) thatU1(c^,d*)≥U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c^,d*)>U2(c¯,d¯). SinceU1(c^,·)is strictly decreasing (Lemma B.1),U2(c^,·)is continuous (Lemma B.2) and the strategy spaceDhas no minimum, there exists a strategyd′<d^such thatd′∈D,U1(c^,d′)>U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c^,d′)>U2(c¯,d¯). Hence, we get from the definition ofU˜1in (4) thatU˜1(c^,d′)>U1(c¯,d¯). This is a contradiction withU˜1(c^,d^)=U1(c¯,d¯). So,c^∈NCand, hence,(c^,d^)∈NC×ND.Let(c^,d^)a Nash equilibrium such thatd^∈(ND)c. Then, we get from the definition in (10) that there exists ac∈Csuch thatU˜1(c,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯). Sincec^∈br1(d^),we haveU˜1(c^,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯). Since the expected utility function U1 is continuous (Lemma B.2) and the strategy spaceDhas no minimum, there exists ad′<d^such thatd′∈DandU1(c^,d′)>U1(c¯,d¯). So, there exists a the strategy d′ as response onc^that will be accepted by Firm 1. According to Lemma B.1, we have that the functionU2(c^,·)is strictly decreasing. Therefore,U˜2(c^,d′)>U˜2(c^,d^)and, so, the response d′ to strategyc^yields a strict improvement for Firm 2. Hence, the strategy profile(c^,d^)is not a Nash equilibrium. This is contradiction. Similarly, we can show that there also does not exist a Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)such thatc^∈(NC)c. Hence, every Nash equilibrium is inNC×ND.The reversed statement that every element ofNC×NDis a Nash equilibrium is shown in Proposition 3.1. This concludes the proof.□We only show the result for the value c*. Letd^∈D. By assumption, it holds thatX1post(·,d^)(ω)is decreasing for all ω ∈ Ω and there is a state ω ∈ Ω such thatlimc→−∞X1post(c,d^)(ω)=−∞. From the market clearing condition in (1) we getX2post(c,d)=X1+X2−X1post(c,d)for all(c,d)≤(c¯,d¯),where the stochastic variableX1+X2is bounded. So, consequently, we have that pay-offX2post(·,d^)(ω)is decreasing for all ω ∈ Ω and there is a state ω ∈ Ω such thatlimc→−∞X2post(c,d^)(ω)=∞. Sinceu2′(·)>0andu2′′(·)<0,we have thatlimx→−∞u2(x)=−∞. Combining this withP2(ω)>0for every ω ∈ Ω yields that we havelimc→−∞U2(c,d^)→−∞. Also, sinceU2(c¯,·)is strictly decreasing (Lemma B.1), we have thatU2(c¯,d^)≥U2(c¯,d¯). SinceU2(·,d^)is strictly increasing (Lemma B.1) and continuous (Lemma B.2), we have according to the intermediate value theorem that there is a unique value c* such thatU2(c*,d^)=U2(c¯,d¯). This concludes the proof.□We prove this result only for the correspondence br1. Ifd^∈ND,we showed thatbr1(d^)=Cin the proof of Proposition 3.1.Letd^∈(ND)c. Then, there exists a strategyc∈Csuch thatU1(c,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯). So, the best response for Firm 1 is given by:(21)br1(d^)=argmaxc∈C{U1(c,d^)|U2(c,d^)≥U2(c¯,d¯)}.Since the expected utility functions U1 and U2 are continuous and the strategy spaceCis compact,br1(d^)is non-empty. Since the functionU1(·,d^)is strictly decreasing and the functionU2(·,d^)is strictly increasing (Lemma B.1), we have that the best response tod^in (21) is singleton-valued, and is given by:br1(d^)={min{c∈C|c≥c*(d^)}}.Ifc*(d^)∈C,thenbr1(d^)={c*(d^)}. Ifc*(d^)∉C,thenc*(d^)<c̲=minCand, so, the best response is given bybr1(d^)={c̲}. This concludes the proof.□We show this result only for br1. From Proposition 3.5, we get thatbr1(d)=max{c̲,c*(d)}ifd∈(ND)cSo, br1 is continuous and increasing on(ND)cif c* is continuous and increasing. Note that c* is the solution ofU2(c*(d),d)=U2(c¯,d¯)for alld∈(−∞,d¯]. We have that U2 is strictly monotonic (Lemma B.1) and continuous (Lemma B.2). Then, continuity of c* follows directly from the implicit function theorem.Next, we show that c* is increasing. Letd∈(ND)c. Since U2(c, ·) is strictly decreasing (Lemma B.1), we haveU2(c*(d),d^)<U2(c*(d),d)=U2(c¯,d¯)for alld^>d. Since U2( ·, d) is strictly increasing, we havec*(d^)>c*(d). Similarly, we can show that c*(d′) < c*(d) for all d′ < d. Hence, c* is strictly increasing and, so, increasing.□This result is in fact an extension of Theorem 3.3. We only show the first result, and the proof of the second result is similar. Suppose that there exists a Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)∈C×Dsuch thatd^>d̲andU˜1(c^,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯). Then, it follows from (4) thatU˜1(c^,d^)=U1(c^,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c^,d^)≥U2(c¯,d¯). SinceU2(c^,·)is strictly decreasing (Lemma B.1) andU1(c^,·)is continuous (Lemma B.2), there exists ad′<d^such thatU1(c^,d′)>U1(c¯,d¯)andU2(c^,d′)>U2(c^,d^)≥U2(c¯,d¯). So, we haveU˜2(c^,d′)>U˜2(c^,d^). Therefore, for Firm 2, d′ is a strictly better response thand^and, so,d^is not a best response. Hence,(c^,d^)is not a Nash equilibrium. This is a contradiction. So, if there exists a Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)∈C×Dsuch thatU˜1(c^,d^)>U1(c¯,d¯),we have thatd^=d̲.Suppose that the strategy profile(c^,d̲)is a Nash equilibrium in which Firm 1 strictly benefits. From (10), it follows thatd̲∈(ND)c. Therefore, the best response for Firm 1 to strategyd^=d̲is given by the strategybr1(d̲)=max{c*(d̲),c̲}and, so, the strategy profile (br1(d),d) is the unique Nash equilibrium where Firm 1 strictly benefits. This concludes the proof.□Suppose that there exist multiple Nash equilibria where at least one firm strictly benefits. From Theorem 3.7, we get that there exist two Nash equilibria(c^1,d̲),(c̲,d^2)∈NEin which at least one firm strictly benefits. Supposec^1>c̲andd^2>d̲. Since in both Nash equilibria at least one firm strictly benefits, we have according to Theorem 3.7 that Firm 1 strictly benefits in(c^1,d̲)and Firm 2 strictly benefits in(c̲,d^2). Therefore,(c̲,d̲)∈(NC)c×(ND)c,and, so, we havebr1(d̲)=c^1=c*(d̲)andbr2(c̲)=d^2=d*(c̲). Sincec*(d̲)∈Candd*(c̲)∈D,we get c*(d) ≥cand d*(c) ≥d. From this and from the fact that U2(c, ·) is strictly decreasing and U2( ·, d) strictly increasing (Lemma B.1), it follows thatU2(c¯,d¯)=U2(c*(d̲),d̲)≥U2(c̲,d*(c̲)),where the equality follows from the definition of c*. This is a contradiction, since Firm 2 strictly benefits in the strategy profile(c̲,d^2)=(c̲,d*(c̲)). So, we have thatc^1=c̲ord^2=d̲. Then, from Theorem 3.7 it follows thatc^1=c̲andd^2=d̲and, moreover,(c^1,d̲)=(c̲,d^2)=(c̲,d̲)=f(c̲,d̲).Next, we show that if there exists a firm that strictly benefits in a Nash equilibrium, this equilibrium is given by f(c,d). Suppose that the strategy profile(c^2,d̲)is the Nash equilibrium in which Firm 1 strictly benefits. Then, we haved̲∈(ND)cand, therefore,c^2=br1(d̲). Ifbr1(d̲)=c*(d̲),thenbr1(d̲)∈NCand, so,(c^2,d̲)=(c*(d̲),d̲)=f(c̲,d̲). Ifbr1(d̲)=c̲>c*(d),thenbr1(d̲)∈(NC)cand, so,(c^2,d̲)=(c̲,d̲)=f(c̲,d̲). This concludes the proof.□Suppose there is a Nash equilibrium(c^,d^)∉(NC×ND)∪{f(c̲,d̲)}.Supposec^∈NC. The best response toc^is given by anyd∈br2(c^)=C,and satisfiesU˜1(c^,d)=U1(c¯,d¯)for alld∈D. Ifd^∈(ND)c,there exists a unique best response given bybr1(d^)=max{c̲,c*(d^)}withU˜1(br1(d^),d^)>U1(c¯,d¯)=U˜1(c^,d^). This is a contradiction with that(c^,d^)is a Nash equilibrium. Hence, it holds thatd^∈ND,which is a contradiction with(c^,d^)∉NC×ND.Supposec^∈(NC)c. From the previous contradiction, it follows that alsod^∈(ND)c. From Proposition 3.5, we then getc^=br1(d^)=max{c̲,c*(d^)}andd^=br2(c^)=max{d̲,d*(c^)}. Supposebr2(c^)=d̲. Then,c^=br1(d̲)=max{c̲,c*(d̲)}and, so,(c^,d^)=(br1(d̲),d̲)=f(c̲,d̲). This is a contradiction. Supposebr2(c^)=d*(c^)>d̲and, moreover,c^>c̲. According to Theorem 3.7, there are no welfare gains in this Nash equilibrium. Hence,(c^,d^)∈NC×ND,which is a contradiction. Ifc^=c̲,thend^=br2(c̲)and, so,(c^,d^)=(c̲,br2(c̲))=f(c̲,d̲). This is a contradiction as well.Hence,(c^,d^)∈(NC×ND)∪{f(c̲,d̲)}. This concludes the proof.□If both firms use the proportional rule as parametric form to redistribute their risk, or if one firm uses the proportional rule and one firm a risk-free payment, we haveλXipost(c,d)+(1−λ)Xipost(c′,d′)=Xipost(λc+(1−λ)c′,λd+(1−λ)d′),foralli∈{1,2},and for all(c,d),(c′,d′)≤(c¯,d¯)and λ ∈ [0, 1]. The rest of this proof follows from the same reasoning as in Riddell (1981), but it is shown for completeness.Leta,b∈Aand λ ∈ [0, 1]. By definition of the setAin (15), there exist(c,d),(c′,d′)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]such that a ≤ ΔU(c, d) and b ≤ ΔU(c′, d′). From concavity of the utility function ui( · ), it follows thatΔUi(λc+(1−λ)c′,λd+(1−λ)d′)=EPi[ui(−λXipost(c,d)−(1−λ)Xipost(c′,d′))]−Ui(c¯,d¯)≥λΔUi(c,d)+(1−λ)ΔUi(c′,d′)≥λai+(1−λ)bi,for all i ∈ {1, 2}. Since(λc+(1−λ)c′,λd+(1−λ)d′)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯],it holds thatΔU(λc+(1−λ)c′,λd+(1−λ)d′)∈A. From this and that the setAis comprehensive, we getλa+(1−λ)b∈Aand, hence, the setAis convex. This concludes the proof.□Comprehensiveness of the setAholds by construction. Since(0,0)∈A,the setA∩IR+2is non-empty. Since ΔUiis continuous (Lemma B.2) and the domain[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]is compact, we have that the setA^={a∈IR2|∃(c,d)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]:a=ΔU(c,d)}is compact. Therefore, the setA,which is the comprehensive hull ofA^,is closed as well. Therefore, the setA∩IR+2is the intersection of two closed sets which is closed as well. Moreover, the setA^is bounded from above and the setIR+2is bounded from below. Therefore, the setA∩IR+2is bounded and, hence, compact. So, the setAis a bargaining problem. This concludes the proof.□Suppose that the vector (a, 0) is Pareto optimal with a > 0. Then, there exists a strategy profile(c,d)∈[0,c¯]×[0,d¯]such that(a,0)=ΔU(c,d). Clearlyc<c¯. Then, since U1( ·, d) is continuous (Lemma B.2) and U2( ·, d) is strictly increasing (Lemma B.1), there exists a c′ > c such that ΔU(c′, d) > 0. The proof is similar if there exists a Pareto optimal vector (0, a) with a > 0. This concludes the proof.□
