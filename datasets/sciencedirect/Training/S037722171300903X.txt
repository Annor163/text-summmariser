@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In a recent paper, Hsieh and Liu (2010) consider quality investment and inspection strategies of one supplier and one manufacturer. They propose solutions of four non-cooperative game models with different degrees of information available about the players’ inspection sampling rates and quality investments. For the two most comprehensive scenarios, we show that these (interior) solutions do not always represent the optimal solutions, as the boundary solutions lead to considerably higher profits. Furthermore, we propose modified algorithms providing the optimal solutions by including the boundary solutions into the consideration.Hsieh and Liu (2010) study a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one manufacturer, whose imperfect production processes depend on each players quality investmentqiwithi∈{sp,mp}(where indexspstands for the supplier’s production site andmpfor the manufacturer’s, respectively). To reduce the quantity of defect items, which occur at a defective rate ofri(qi)with(1)ri(qi)=1-αiqi,i∈{sp,mp},both players apply inspections. Here,αiwith0<αi⩽1describes the sensitivity of the defective rate to the quality investmentqi. Thereby, three inspection points are distinguished, each with a certain sampling rateρjand a certain probability of correctly identifying defective itemsθjwithj∈{so,mi,mo}: the supplier’s outbound inspection (so) as well as the manufacturer’s inbound (mi) and outbound inspection site (mo), respectively. It is assumed that intact items are always identified correctly. With the combination of two imperfect manufacturing steps as well as three imperfect inspections, this approach is more comprehensive and, thus, more complex than other existing analyses related to quality (like, e.g., Baiman, Fischer, & Rajan, 2000; Balachandran & Radhakrishnan, 2005; Hwang, Radhakrishnan, & Su, 2006; Lim, 2001; Reyniers & Tapiero, 1995a, 1995b).The unit selling prices of conforming items of the supplier and the manufacturer arepsandpm, respectively, while each player has to bear a unit penalty costwsandwm, respectively, for non-conforming items that are delivered to and identified by the next echelon. Further considered costs are the unit production costCPiof each production process i with(2)CPi(qi)=12aiqi2-biqi,i∈{sp,mp}as well as the unit inspection cost of each inspection site j with(3)CIj(ρj)=cj+djρj,j∈{so,mi,mo}.Thereby, the two positive parametersaiandbiin Eq. (2) characterize the unit production cost function, while the two positive parameterscjanddjin Eq. (3) determine the fixed and variable unit inspection costs.The domains of definition of the given variables and parameters are in accordance to Hsieh and Liu (2010), with the exception that the variables denoting quality investment (qi) and sampling rate (ρj) may take values between zero and one including both boundaries, i.e.,0⩽qi,ρj⩽1(as opposed to0<qi,ρj⩽1). This deviation is due to the fact that we will show the optimality of solutions at the boundary of domain of definition later on in the sequel.Following the explanation in Hsieh and Liu (2010), one can determine the unit profit functions of supplier and manufacturer by enumerating the profits of each of the 47 paths of the resulting probability tree and multiplying them by the likelihood of occurrence (see Table 1 in Hsieh & Liu, 2010). This leads us to the following profit function of the supplier(4)πs=ps[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso]-12aspqsp2+bspqsp-csoρso-dsoρso2-ws(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)ρmiθmi.The first order partial derivatives of the supplier’s profit function, i.e.,∂πs/∂qspand∂πs/∂ρso, are given in Eqs. (6) and (7) of Hsieh and Liu (2010):(5)∂πs∂qsp=bsp+αsppsρsoθso+αspwsρmiθmi(1-ρsoθso)-aspqsp,(6)∂πs∂ρso=θso(1-αspqsp)(wsρmiθmi-ps)-cso-2dsoρso.Eqs. (5) and (6) set to zero constitute the necessary conditions for the optimality of an interior solution. However, we are only able to definitely prove the optimality of this solution if the profit functionπs(qsp,ρso)is concave, because solutions at the boundary of the domain of definition0⩽qsp,ρso≤1might lead to higher values ofπsotherwise, even if the interior solution represents a local maximum. By means of the Hessian matrix ofπs(qsp,ρso), we derive the following proposition regarding the optimal solution:Proposition 1A feasible strategyqsp∗,ρso∗fulfilling the necessary conditions∂πs/∂qsp=0and∂πs/∂ρso=0(see Eqs. (5) and (6)) maximizes the supplier’s expected profit per unit, if the following condition holds:[αspθso(ps-wsρmiθmi)]2-2aspdso⩽0.Asπs(qsp,ρso)is a quadratic function, there exists at most one solution which fulfills the necessary condition that the gradient ofπs(qsp,ρso)equals zero. Next, we consider the Hessian matrix ofπs(qsp,ρso)as well as the related derivatives which are given in Proposition 1 and 3 and the corresponding proofs in Hsieh and Liu (2010). Thereby, one can see that – if the above inequality holds – the Hessian matrix is negative semidefinite, which implies thatπs(qsp,ρso)is a concave function. This is a sufficient condition for optimality and, hence,(qsp∗,ρso∗)is a global maximum ofπs(qsp,ρso). This completes the proof of Proposition 1.The profit function of the manufacturer can be formulated in the same way by means of Table 1 in Hsieh and Liu (2010):(7)πm=[(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp]·(pm-wm)(1-ρmoθmo)-12ampqmp2+bmpqmp-cmoρmo-dmoρmo2+αspqspαmpqmp[pmρmoθmo-wm(ρmoθmo-1)]-ps+cmiρmi+dmiρmi2[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso]+ws(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)ρmiθmi.We can now calculate the first order partial derivatives of the manufacturer’s profit function, which constitute the necessary conditions for the optimality of an interior solution when set to zero:(8)∂πm∂ρmi=(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)θmiws-(pm-wm)(1-ρmoθmo)+cmoρmo+dmoρmo2+12ampqmp2-bmpqmp-(cmi+2dmiρmi)[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso](9)∂πm∂qmp=[(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp](bmp-ampqmp)+αspqspαmp[pmρmoθmo-wm(ρmoθmo-1)](10)∂πm∂ρmo=[(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp]·[-(pm-wm)θmo-cmo-2dmoρmo]+αspqspαmpqmpθmo(pm-wm).Please note that the derivatives∂πm/∂ρmiand∂πm/∂ρmodiffer from the expressions given in Eqs. (8) and (10) in Hsieh and Liu (2010) by the terms(1-αspqsp)ρso(1-θso)(1-θmi)ρmo(1-θmo)wmand(1-αspqsp)ρso(1-θso)ρmi(1-θmi)(1-θmo)wm, respectively.1According to the probability values, we may presume thatwmwas not taken into account for the paths 5 and 6 of Table 1 when formulating the function ofπmin Hsieh and Liu (2010), though it is itemized within the table.1However, we will use the correct expressions given in Eqs. (8) and (10) in the sequel.Similar to the supplier’s problem in Section 2.1, we can only prove the optimality of an interior solution fulfilling these necessary conditions if the profit functionπm(ρmi,qmp,ρmo)is concave, as solutions at the boundary have to be considered otherwise.Hence, we now have to establish the Hessian matrix ofπm(ρmi,qmp,ρmo). Please note that this step is omitted by Hsieh and Liu (2010), who only consider the second order partial derivatives∂2πm/∂ρmi2,∂2πm/∂qmp2, and∂2πm/∂ρmo2, which is not a sufficient proof of the concavity of the manufacturer’s profit function. Thereby, we obtain the following proposition:Proposition 2A feasible strategy(ρmi∗,qmp∗,ρmo∗)fulfilling the necessary conditions∂πm/∂ρmi=0,∂πm/∂qmp=0, and∂πm/∂ρmo=0(see Eqs. (8)–(10)) maximizes the manufacturer’s expected profit per unit, if the following conditions hold for every feasible combination ofρmi,qmp, andρmo:(i)-2ampdmoλ22+λ32⩽0,-4dmidmoλ1λ2+λ42λ52⩽0,-2ampdmiλ1λ2+λ42λ62⩽0,-2ampdmidmoλ1λ22+λ3λ42λ5λ6+dmoλ2λ42λ62+12ampλ2λ42λ52+dmiλ1λ32⩽0,To prove the concavity of the manufacturer’s profit function, the following Hessian matrix has to be negative semidefinite:(11)H(πm)=∂2πm∂qmp2∂2πm∂qmp∂ρmo∂2πm∂qmp∂ρmi∂2πm∂ρmo∂qmp∂2πm∂ρmo2∂2πm∂ρmo∂ρmi∂2πm∂ρmi∂qmp∂2πm∂ρmi∂ρmo∂2πm∂ρmi2.The second order partial derivatives are as follows:(12)∂2πm∂qmp2=-amp[(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp],(13)∂2πm∂ρmo2=-2dmo[(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp],(14)∂2πm∂ρmi2=-2dmi[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso],(15)∂2πm∂qmp∂ρmo=∂2πm∂ρmo∂qmp=(pm-wm)αspqspαmpθmo,(16)∂2πm∂qmp∂ρmi=∂2πm∂ρmi∂qmp=(ampqmp-bmp)(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)θmi,(17)∂2πm∂ρmo∂ρmi=∂2πm∂ρmi∂ρmo=[(pm-wm)θmo+cmo+2dmoρmo]·(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)θmi.With the auxiliary variablesλlwithl=1,…,6given in Proposition 2, the Hessian matrix in Eq. (11) can be written as(18)H(πm)=-ampλ2λ3λ4λ6λ3-2dmoλ2λ4λ5λ4λ6λ4λ5-2dmiλ1.The first order principal minors ofH(πm)are(19)detH11(πm)=-ampλ2,(20)detH12(πm)=-2dmoλ2,(21)detH13(πm)=-2dmiλ1.The second order principal minors ofH(πm)are(22)detH21(πm)=2ampdmoλ22-λ32,(23)detH22(πm)=4dmidmoλ1λ2-λ42λ52,(24)detH23(πm)=2ampdmiλ1λ2-λ42λ62.The third order principal minor ofH(πm)is(25)detH3(πm)=-4ampdmidmoλ1λ22+2λ3λ42λ5λ6+2dmoλ2λ42λ62+ampλ2λ42λ52+2dmiλ1λ32.According to Sylvester’s criterion, a Hessian matrix is negative semidefinite, if the first and third order principal minors are non-positive and the second order principal minors are non-negative (see Prussing, 1986; Swamy, 1973).Asλ1andλ2are always non-negative, it is obvious that the first order principal minors are always non-positive. The remaining four conditions constitute Part (i)–(iv) of Proposition 2. This completes the proof of Proposition 2.□Hsieh and Liu (2010) study four game models with different degrees of information available to the players. In the most comprehensive game (Game I), the supplier has to determine the variablesqspandρso, while the manufacturer decides onρmi,qmp, andρmo. However, the resulting system of equations cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, Hsieh and Liu (2010) propose to simplify the game by assuming that the manufacturer’s inbound sampling rateρmiis common knowledge and, thus, is no object of the optimization problem (Game II, which is denoted reduced game in the sequel). We do not consider the remaining two games, which are further reduced, because they are similar to previously studied models (see e.g. Baiman et al., 2000; Lim, 2001; Reyniers & Tapiero, 1995a, 1995b for Game III and Hwang et al., 2006 for Game IV) and do not contain any optimality issues like the first two games. As the obtained solution is used to solve the comprehensive game, we start with the reduced game.Asρmiis a variable of the manufacturer, the supplier’s optimization problem remains unchanged. To determine the interior solution of the supplier’s strategy(qsp∗,ρso∗), we have to solve the equation system consisting of∂πs/∂qsp=0and∂πs/∂ρso=0(see Eqs. (5) and (6)). Hence, we derive (see Eqs. (15) and (16) in Hsieh & Liu, 2010):(26)qsp∗=αspθso(wsρmiθmi-ps)[θso(wsρmiθmi-ps)-cso]-2dso(bsp+αspwsρmiθmi)[αspθso(wsρmiθmi-ps)]2-2dsoasp,(27)ρso∗=θso(wsρmiθmi-ps)[αsp(bsp+αspwsρmiθmi)-asp]+csoasp[αspθso(wsρmiθmi-ps)]2-2dsoasp.However, as explained in Section 2.1, the optimality of this interior solution of the supplier’s problem can only be determined unambiguously if the conditions given in Proposition 1 are met.For a given manufacturer’s inbound sampling rate, we do not have to considerρmias a decision variable and the necessary optimality condition∂πm/∂ρmi=0(see Eq. (8)) can be neglected in this case. Thus, we are now able to determine the interior solution of the manufacturer’s strategy(qmp∗,ρmo∗)unambiguously by solving the equation system consisting of∂πm/∂qmp=0and∂πm/∂ρmo=0(see Eqs. (9) and (10)). This leads us to:(28)qmp∗=2dmoκ1(κ1bmp+αspqspwmαmp)-κ1κ2[(pm-wm)θmo+cmo]2dmoκ12amp-κ22,(29)ρmo∗=κ2(κ1bmp+αspqspwmαmp)-κ12amp[(pm-wm)θmo+cmo]2dmoκ12amp-κ22,withκ1=(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)(1-ρmiθmi)+αspqsp,κ2=(pm-wm)αspqspαmpθmo.Obviously, our expressions differ from Eqs. (17) and (18) in Hsieh and Liu (2010), which is due to the differences within the corresponding first order partial derivatives.Concerning the optimality of this interior solution, the omission ofρmialso facilitates the sufficient conditions given in Proposition 2, as Part (ii)–(iv) of this proposition can be neglected in the reduced game.In the comprehensive game, the supplier’s decision variablesqspandρsoas well as the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions remain the same as in the reduced game, while the manufacturer’s variables areρmi,qmp, andρmo, and his expected profit per unit isπm(ρmi,qmp,ρmo). Therefore, the system of equations consisting of the first order partial derivatives given in Eqs. (8)–(10) set to zero has to be solved, which is analytically intractable.In order to still determine the equilibrium, Hsieh and Liu (2010) propose an iterative solution procedure, which can easily be transferred to the expressions derived above. Herein,τis a starting value with0⩽τ⩽1,Δcontrols the converging speed with0<Δ<1/∊,∊is a small positive value which describes the desired closeness of the solution, andρ̃mican be derived from solving Eq. (8) set to zero:(30)ρ̃mi={(1-αspqsp)(1-ρsoθso)θmi·ws-(pm-wm)(1-ρmoθmo)+12ampqmp2-bmpqmp+cmoρmo+dmoρmo2-cmi[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso]}/{2dmi[1-(1-αspqsp)ρsoθso]}.Procedure 1:Finding an equilibrium of the comprehensive game.Step 0:Initialization: Setn=0andρmi(n)=τ.Step 1:Givenρmi(n), determineqsp∗,ρso∗,qmp∗, andρmo∗by means of Eqs. (26)–(29); and evaluateρmi(n+1)=ρmi(n)+[ρ̃mi-ρmi(n)]/Δ.Step 2:If|ρmi(n+1)-ρmi(n)|<∊, terminate procedure and returnqsp∗,ρso∗,ρmi(n),qmp∗, andρmo∗as equilibrium. Otherwise, setn=n+1and repeat Step 1.Procedure 1Please note that this approach only determines one possible root ofρmi, which has not necessarily to be unique. From inserting Eqs. (28) and (29) into Eq. (30) results a quintic function, which may have up to five roots. Due to the complexity of the resulting function, we are unfortunately neither able to prove that Eq. (30) is the only root in the domain of definition, nor to derive the remaining roots analytically. Therefore, we suppose to set up the function as described above and to check numerically ifρ̃miis the only feasible root for the given set of parameters. In the case of more than one root in the range0⩽ρmi⩽1, that feasible triple(ρmi∗,qmp∗,ρmo∗)has to be selected for further processing which leads to the highest expected profit per unit of the manufacturer.Similar to the reduced game, the optimality of an interior solution can only be determined unambiguously if the conditions given in Proposition 2 are met. In the comprehensive game, all conditions stated in this proposition apply.We adopt the same parameter setting as in Hsieh and Liu (2010), i.e.,asp=60,bsp=20,amp=150,bmp=25,αsp=αmp=0.98,cso=cmi=3,cmo=6,dso=dmi=1.5,dmo=2.5,θso=θmi=θmo=0.95,ps=25,pm=100,ws=120, andwm=200.Table 1shows the interior solutions of our computation of the reduced and comprehensive game. The solution of the latter is derived with parametersτ=0.5andΔ=10after ten iterations and corresponds to an exactness of∊=10-4. Of particular interest are the last four columns of the table, where the left sides of the optimality conditions established in Section 2 are stated. Please note that bold ciphers denote a violation of the respective condition. As visible, both games do not even meet the optimality conditions at this specific interior solution, though the conditions must be fulfilled for the entire domain of definition to prove the optimality of this solution unambiguously. Hence, the given interior solutions do not necessarily represent the optimal solutions of the considered games, as the corresponding profit functions are not concave. This can be easily proven by calculating the players’ profits in the reduced game with fixedρmi=0.5for arbitrarily modified valuesqsp=0.84,ρso=0.86,qmp=0.94, andρmo=0.84, which results in higher profits, i.e.,πs=11.487andπm=11.380.Hence, new solution procedures are proposed in the sequel, which do not only consider interior solutions, but also solutions at the boundary of the domain of definition, i.e., zero and one (which are called boundary solutions in the sequel).Whenρmiis constant, the expressions given in Eqs. (26)–(29) are the only roots of the first order partial derivatives given in Eqs. (5), (6), (9) and (10) and no other stationary points exist, i.e., there are no other candidates for local extrema. Therefore, if the optimality conditions given in Proposition 1 and Part (i) of Proposition 2 are violated, this interior solution has to be compared with the profit resulting from boundary solutions.Hence, a new solution procedure must meet two requirements: It first has to verify whether the optimality conditions of the interior solution are met, and, if not, it has to determine the boundary solution with the maximum profit for both players afterwards. For the second step, one has to set each decision variable to zero or one, respectively, and calculate the remaining decision variable of the player subject to the variable under consideration. From Eqs. (5), (6), (9) and (10) set to zero, we derive the necessary expressions (see Section 3.1 for the definition of the used auxiliary variablesκkwithk=1,2):(31)q̃sp(ρso)=[bsp+αspwsθmiρmi+(ps-wsθmiρmi)αspθsoρso]/asp,(32)ρ̃so(qsp)=[-(ps-wsθmiρmi)θso-cso+(ps-wsθmiρmi)αspθsoqsp]/(2dso),(33)q̃mp(ρmo)=[αspαmpwmqsp+bmpκ1+κ2ρmo]/(ampκ1),(34)ρ̃mo(qmp)={-κ1[(pm-wm)θmo+cmo]+κ2qmp}/(2dmoκ1).As the above functions can take values outside the domain of definition set in Section 1, we define an auxiliary functionf(x)with(35)f(x)=0,forx<0,x,for0⩽x⩽1,1,forx>1,in order to correct these violations to values at the boundary of domain of definitions, i.e., to zero and one, respectively. This is possible, because the second order partial derivatives of the profit functions are always negative (see Proof of Propositions 1 and 2). Thereby, the solution procedure can be formulated as follows:Procedure 2:Finding an equilibrium of the reduced game with consideration of boundary solutions.Step 1:Determine interior solution for supplier’s strategyqsp∗,ρso∗by means of Eqs. (26) and (27).Step 2:Verify, if condition in Proposition 1 is valid; if yes,qspopt,ρsoopt=qsp∗,ρso∗, proceed with Step 5; else, setσI=qsp∗,ρso∗and proceed with Step 3.Step 3:Determine optimal boundary solution for supplier’s strategy:(a)Letσl=qspl,ρsol. Calculateσ1=(1,f(ρ̃so(1))),σ2=(0,f(ρ̃so(0))),σ3=(f(q̃sp(1)),1), andσ4=(f(q̃sp(0)),0)by means of Eqs. (31) and (32).(b)DetermineσB=argmaxl=1,…,4πs(σl).Step 4:Determineqspopt,ρsoopt=argmaxl=I,Bπs(σl).Step 5:Determine interior solution for manufacturer’s strategyqmp∗,ρmo∗by means of Eqs. (28) and (29).Step 6:Verify, if Part (i) of Proposition 2 is valid; if yes,qmpopt,ρmoopt=qmp∗,ρmo∗, proceed with Step 9; else, setμI=qmp∗,ρmo∗and proceed with Step 7.Step 7:Determine optimal boundary solution for manufacturer’s strategy:(a)Letμl=qmpl,ρmol. Calculateμ1=(1,f(ρ̃mo(1))),μ2=(0,f(ρ̃mo(0))),μ3=(f(q̃mp(1)),1), andμ4=(f(q̃mp(0)),0)by means of Eqs. (33) and (34).(b)DetermineμB=argmaxl=1,…,4πm(μl).Step 8:Determineqmpopt,ρmoopt=argmaxl=I,Bπm(μl).Step 9:Terminate procedure and returnqspopt,ρsoopt,qmpopt, andρmooptas equilibrium.Our solution procedure for the comprehensive game, which maximizes the expected profits per unitπs(qsp,ρso)andπm(ρmi,qmp,ρmo), follows an idea similar to the one developed in the previous section. Starting from a feasible and profit-maximizing strategyqspopt,ρsooptof the supplier for a given inbound inspection rateρmi, it identifies a feasible and profit-maximizing strategyρmiopt,qmpopt,ρmooptof the manufacturer. After that, one has to check if both players assume the same value ofρmi. If yes, an equilibrium is identified; else, another iteration with a new starting value ofρmiis necessary.As our numerical example in Section 4.1 yields, it is necessary to check the concavity of the profit functions and, where required, to include the boundaries of the domain of definition into the consideration. Table 2indicates the possible boundary solutions as well as the formulae which are necessary to determine the corresponding values of the remaining variables. Please note that some of the – in total 30 – possible combinations which would arise from this scheme are redundant (e.g., the tripleμ2=(0,0,f(ρ̃mo(0)))could also arise in the second group of the first column withqmp=0, whenρmiis set to zero accordingly) and are therefore omitted.To keep mathematical formulae simple, we use the auxiliary variablesκkwithk=1,2defined in Section 3.1 as well asκkwithk=3,…,8:κ3=(1-αspqsp)(1-θsoρso),κ4=(pm-wm)θmo+cmo,κ5=1-(1-αspqsp)θsoρso,κ6=ws-pm+wm+12ampqmp2-bmpqmp,κ7=ws-(pm-wm)(1-θmoρmo)+cmoρmo+dmoρmo2,κ8=αspαmpwmqsp.E.g., solutionμ1corresponds to a fixedρmi=0, whereqmpandρmocan be identified by means of Eqs. (28) and (29). In order to determine the solutions corresponding to a fixedqmp, i.e.,μ11andμ14, one first has to find the rootρˇmoof(36)θmiκ3κ4(θmiκ3κ6-cmiκ5)-2dmiκ5[κ4(κ3+αspqsp)-qmpκ2]+θmi2κ32κ42+2dmoθmiκ3(θmiκ3κ6-cmiκ5)-4dmodmiκ5(κ3+αspqsp)ρˇmo+3dmoθmi2κ32κ4ρˇmo2+2dmo2θmi2κ32ρˇmo3=0,which can be derived from equalizing Eqs. (8) and (10), and has to insert it into Eq. (37) afterwards:(37)ρˇmi(ρmo)=(θmiκ3κ6-cmiκ5+θmiκ3κ4ρmo+dmoθmiκ3ρmo2)/(2dmiκ5).For the remaining solutions of this block, it is sufficient to replace the corresponding values forqmpandρmowithin the latter expression. Similarly, one has to find the rootq¯mpof(38)bmpθmiκ3(θmiκ3κ7-cmiκ5)-2dmiκ5[κ2ρmo+κ8+bmp(αspqsp+κ3)]+-bmp2θmi2κ32-ampθmiκ3(θmiκ3κ7-cmiκ5)+2dmiampκ5(αspqsp+κ3)q¯mp+32ampbmpθmi2κ32q¯mp2+-12amp2θmi2κ32q¯mp3=0,which can be derived from equalizing Eqs. (9) and (8), and to insert it into(39)ρ¯mi(qmp)=(θmiκ3κ7-cmiκ5-bmpθmiκ3qmp+12ampθmiκ3qmp2)/(2dmiκ5)in order to determineμ17andμ18.With these expressions, we can now formulate our solution procedure for the comprehensive game as follows:Procedure 3:Finding an equilibrium of the comprehensive game with consideration of boundary solutions.Step 0:Initialization: Setn=0andρmi(n)=τ.Step 1:Givenρmi(n), determineqspopt,ρsooptas described in Step 1 to 4 of Procedure 2.Step 2:Givenqsp(n)=qspoptandρso(n)=ρsoopt, determineρmiopt,qmpopt,ρmoopt:(a)Determine interior solution for manufacturer’s strategyρmi∗,qmp∗,ρmo∗as described in Procedure 1 (for constantqsp=qsp(n)andρso=ρso(n)).(b)Verify, if conditions in Proposition 2 are valid; if yes,ρmiopt,qmpopt,ρmoopt=ρmi∗,qmp∗,ρmo∗, proceed with Step 3; else, proceed with Step 2 c).(c)Determine optimal boundary solution for manufacturer’s strategy: letμl=ρmil,qmpl,ρmol; calculateμlwithl=1,…,18as indicated in Table 2; determineρmiopt,qmpopt,ρmoopt=argmaxl=1,…,18πm(μl).Step 3:If|ρmi(n+1)-ρmi(n)|<∊, terminate procedure and returnqspopt,ρsoopt,ρmiopt=ρmi(n),qmpopt, andρmooptas equilibrium; otherwise, setn=n+1and repeat Step 1.Finally, we apply the same parameter setting as in Section 4.1 and compute the equilibria of both considered games by means of the procedures proposed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The results as well as the equilibria derived by Hsieh and Liu (2010) are listed in Table 3. It is clearly visible that, in both cases, our solution procedures yield significantly higher profits than the solutions proposed by Hsieh and Liu (2010). The supplier can achieve an increase in profit of about20%in both the reduced and the comprehensive game, while the manufacturer’s profit raises by nearly60%in the reduced and nearly50%in the comprehensive game.
