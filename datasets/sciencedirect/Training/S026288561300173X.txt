Graphical abstractBurns et al. [56] empirically discovered the fact that connected regions with common gradient orientation would almost always coincide with straight edges. Recently, reference [57] showed that a complex boundary of image can be split into one or more straight line segments. Moreover, our observation shows that a straight line segment must be constructed by several (at least three) adjacent edge pixels. Such a straight line segment will be called edge-linear segment (ELS)that represents an image region or a line-support region whose points share roughly the same image gradient direction [56–58]. More importantly, an ELS possesses useful geometry-structural information that includes three characteristics [1,2]:Anisotropy: The presence of an edge implies that the image variation within a neighborhood around this edge pixel is anisotropic. More accurately speaking, image variation within such neighborhood is fast and slow across and along this edge, respectively.Continuity: Multiple closely-related edges should exhibit a continuity that reflects the nature of the boundary in the physical environment. Most physical boundaries of interest are continuous in nature. Such continuity implies that there is not any isolated edge pixel.Elongation: An image boundary is formed by a contiguous chain of edge pixels, and can be well approximated by multiple ELS, where each ELS should consist of several (at least three) edge pixels. Assume that the shortest distance between two adjacent pixels is δ, then the length of a short ELS is larger than or equal to 2δ, which is called elongation of an ELS. Such elongation shows that each edge pixel must belong to an ELS, and we should simultaneously detect multiple (at least three) related edge pixels.The first characteristic above means that a good convolution kernel designed for edge detection should be anisotropic in order to well match the image within a neighborhood around an edge pixel. This characteristic has been extensively used in many state-of-the-art edge detectors [3]. The second characteristic above implies that if an edge pixel derived by a detector is isolated, it should be taken as the removable candidate of false positive edge pixels. The third characteristic above indicates that a size-appropriate neighborhood around each edge pixel certainly includes multiple edge pixels that can approximately form, at least, an ELS. Thus, among the multiple closely-related edges, there must be both continuity and elongation of a boundary (CEB). The CEB has been widely exploited in chain of edge points into curves [56–59].Image edges usually convey the most relevant information [4,5] and their detection is an essential goal in computer vision and image processing [6,7]. Although identifying and localizing edges have been researched for more than 50years, they are still a very challenging task in a variety of applications [8]. Hence, the detection of edges in an image is still an important topic until now. Edge detection is the process which detects the presence and locations of these intensity transitions [9]. Giuseppe and Nicolai [3] presented a thorough overview of various edge and contour detection approaches that have been proposed in the last two decades. The reference [3] makes these approaches to be divided into global and local operators.The global operators [3] include mainly three classes: contour saliency, grouping of pixels together in contours, and active contours. The first two classes first start from the edge strength map gotten by local operators [4,5,22]. Then, in the first class [3], contour detection uses the surrounding context and is performed by inhibiting and enhancing the edge strength map; in the second class [3,10], edge pixels are grouped together into contours in the light of the Gestalt laws of proximity, good continuation, closure, and symmetry. Especially, it is worth pointing out that several available methods [56–59] for detecting linear segments belong to the second class. Hough transform is a standard method for extraction of line segments. Many methods make edge points to be chained into curves and then cut the chains into multiple ELS by a straightness criterion [60]. Other methods make this oriented gradient response of edge map to be thresholded to detect line segments. In particular, without the edge detection step, the third class (also called snakes or deformable models) performs together both edge detection and contour extraction [3,11]. More interestingly, active contours based on the variational principle have been considered the three desirable characteristics of an ELS. They implement both contour localization and interactive contour detection with higher robustness to image degradations. However, a drawback of active contours is their higher computational complexity [3]. Another drawback of active contours is that once their cost function is non-convex, a local minimum might be reached instead of the global one. Due to the above two drawbacks, this paper will emphasize on the local methods.The computationally simple local operators mainly include the differentiation-based methods [12], the Gaussian-based methods [13–27], multi-scale methods based on wavelets [28–32], computational neural networks [33–36], fuzzy reasoning systems [37–41], Gabor filters [42–47], and two-dimensional matched filter (TDMF) [48,49]. It is especially worth mentioning that Canny developed the isotropic operator [22] with an almost optimal vertical filter that is very well approximated by the first order derivative of a Gaussian filter. Moreover, Canny operator is computationally highly effective. However, since the isotropic Gaussian filter (IGF) [22] does not make full use of the anisotropy of image edges, IGF may not efficiently prevent edges from blurring [23].In order to efficiently exploit the anisotropy of image edges, the so-called anisotropic filter is extensively studied in references [19,21,42–49,23–27]. Very interestingly, many existing anisotropic operators for detecting edges can be achieved by the framework of steerable filters [19,21,23–25]. In addition, the decomposition of the anisotropic Gaussian filter into a 1-D Gauss filter in the x-direction and a 1-D filter in a non-orthogonal direction φ was given by Geusebroek [26]. Furthermore, the available fast algorithms [27] were established to fast calculate the orientation-smoothed image and its derivatives. However, the first disadvantage of the anisotropic analysis [23,24] may sometimes obtain no exact basis for rotating an anisotropic Gaussian [25]. The second disadvantage is that estimating φ may be difficult in practice. The third disadvantage is that although various methods for the anisotropic analysis can sufficiently exploit anisotropy of edges, they may not fully utilize CEB.In order to more fully exploit all the three characteristics of edges and the advantages of Canny operator, we heuristically design a new 2-D edge detection operator that satisfies the following three elementary requirements: ① The first derivative of 1-D Gaussian function should be selected as 1-D filter perpendicular to an ELS, because it is a good approximation to the optimal vertical operator. ② Due to the anisotropic nature of edges, the 2-D edge detection operator should be anisotropic so that it can effectively prevent edges from blurring. ③ The 1-D filter along an ELS should further take use of the CEB. It is worth mentioning that the proposed 2-D edge detection operator keeps the above three requirements, while some state-of-the-art methods such as the optimal steerable filters [25] usually hold the first two requirements. Hence, we expect that edges detected by the proposed methods have higher localization accuracy and stronger continuity [1]. This paper includes the following three main contributions. 1) We propose a new multi-pixel anisotropic Gaussian filter kernel to detect edges or edge-line segments, which can more efficiently use the CEB to reduce false positive rate and improve true positive rate. 2) To considerably decrease computational volume, the isotropic Gaussian filter is utilized for fast computing an initial direction along an edge, and our filter is further used to more accurately seek edge-line segment direction by a few of directional filter masks only near such initial direction. 3) Compared with the isotropic Gaussian filter, the improvement factors of the proposed filter are analyzed theoretically in 2-D space.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related works. Section 3 proposes the multi-pixel anisotropic Gaussian filter (MAGF) to exploit the three characteristics of the image near an edge as sufficiently as possible. Section 4 presents the numerical implementation of the proposed MAGF. Section 5 compares our proposed edge-detection algorithm with several existing edge-detection methods. Section 6 concludes this paper.
