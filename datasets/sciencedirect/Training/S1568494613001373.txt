@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper introduces an evolving neural fuzzy modeling approach constructed upon the neo-fuzzy neuron and network. The approach uses an incremental learning scheme to simultaneously granulate the input space and update the neural network weights. The neural network structure and parameters evolve simultaneously as data are input. Initially the space of each input variable is granulated using two complementary triangular membership functions. New triangular membership functions may be added, excluded and/or have their parameters adjusted depending on the input data and modeling error. The parameters of the network are updated using a gradient-based scheme with optimal learning rate. The performance of the approach is evaluated using instances of times series forecasting and nonlinear system identification problems. Computational experiments and comparisons against alternative evolving models show that the evolving neural neo-fuzzy network is accurate and fast, characteristics which are essential for adaptive systems modeling, especially in real-time, on-line environments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fuzzy sets and systems have been successful in many instances of problems in various application domains such as modeling, control, classification, regression. Examples of recent developments include [1–4] in system modeling, [5–7] in system control, [8–15] in forecasting and prediction, [16–21] in classification, and [22–27] in fault detection and diagnosis, to mention a few.There is an increasing interest to augment fuzzy systems with learning and adaptation capabilities. Two of the most visible approaches combine fuzzy systems with the learning and adaptation ability of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms methods. The current challenge is to develop methodologies and algorithms to build systems with high degree of adaptability and autonomy developed from data streams collected on-line, eventually in real time [28]. Adaptability and autonomy mean the aptitude to simultaneously modify the system structure and its parameters whenever new information is found in input data. The evolving system paradigm provides such a capability because it allows learning from experience, inheritance, gradual changes, and knowledge generation from data streams. From the neural networks point of view, an evolving approach may start with an empty or initial untrained neural network and develop new links and weight values from data. The development of the neural network structure is gradual and neurons are neither fixed, nor pre-defined. Continuous learning may produce new neurons each time new data do not fit the existing model [29].This paper suggests an evolving fuzzy neural modeling approach using the neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) introduced by [30] and its extensions [31,32] as the basic processing unit. The choice of the NFN is due to its simplicity, transparency, low computational cost and accuracy, items of utmost importance especially in on-line and real time environments. The original NFN and its extensions granulate the input space with triangular membership functions whose number and modal values remain fixed. The network weights are updated, but the number of fuzzy neurons does not change during learning. Contrary to the previous NFN models, in this paper both, the granulation and modal values of the membership functions of each input variable can be simultaneously updated. The neural fuzzy network evolve its structure and modify its weights whenever necessary, as dictated by input data. That is, whenever a new sample is input, connection weights and the parameters of membership functions can be modified and/or new membership functions added/eliminated to keep a uniform and small output error for any value of the input variable.After this introduction the rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Next section briefly overviews related work to recall the main ideas and approaches for evolving fuzzy systems modeling. Section 3 describes the neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) and network while Section 4 addresses its learning algorithm. Section 5 details the evolving neo-fuzzy neural network (eNFN) approach. In Section 6 the computational complexity of eNFN is compared with alternative evolving methods. Section 7 focuses on streamflow forecasting, the classic Mackey–Glass benchmark, and on the identification of a high-dimensional nonlinear system. It also includes experiments to compare the processing time of eNFN against other evolving models considering the dimension of the input space and the number of neurons. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper summarizing its contributions and issues for future developments.
