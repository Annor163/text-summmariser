@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Extracting rotation invariant features is a valuable technique for the effective classification of rotation invariant texture. The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm has been proved to be theoretically simple, and has been applied in many areas. Also, the co-occurrence HOG (CoHOG) algorithm provides a unified description including both statistical and differential properties of a texture patch. However, HOG and CoHOG have some shortcomings: they discard some important texture information and are not invariant to rotation. In this paper, based on the original HOG and CoHOG algorithms, four novel feature extraction methods are proposed. The first method uses Gaussian derivative filters named GDF-HOG. The second and the third methods use eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix named Eig(Hess)-HOG and Eig(Hess)-CoHOG, respectively. The fourth method exploits the Gaussian and means curvatures to calculate curvatures of the image surface named GM-CoHOG. We have empirically shown that the proposed novel extended HOG and CoHOG methods provide useful information for rotation invariance. The classification results are compared with original HOG and CoHOG algorithms methods on the CUReT, KTH-TIPS, KTH-TIPS2-a and UIUC datasets show that proposed four methods achieve best classification result on all datasets. In addition, we make a comparison with several well-known descriptors. The experiments of rotation invariant analysis are carried out on the Brodatz dataset, and promising results are obtained from those experiments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Texture is an important characteristic of the appearance of objects and is a powerful visual cue, used in describing and recognizing object surfaces [1]. Texture analysis plays an important role in image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision [2–8]. Texture classification methods usually consist of two steps of feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction involves simplifying the amount of resources required to describe a large set of data accurately. To enhance the overall quality of texture classification, both the quality of the texture features and the quality of the classification algorithm must be improved [9–14].There has been intensive research in developing robust features for texture classification with strong invariance to rotation, scale, translation, illumination changes [15–23]. Rotation invariant feature extraction is a difficult problem, thus many algorithms were proposed to achieve the rotation invariance [24,25].The pioneer works to achieve rotation-invariant texture classification include generalized co-occurrence matrices (GCM) [26], polarograms [27], texture anisotropy [28], the methods based on Markov random field (MRF) [29] and autoregressive model. The wavelet based algorithms achieved effective classification performance [30–37]. Recently, the statistical based approaches have attracted considerable attention [38–40]. However, many of these approaches achieve the rotation invariance by shifting the discrete orientations. For example, the method of local binary pattern (LBP) [18] is proposed to achieve rotation invariance [41].The gradient based features such as edges or orientation angles are widely used as feature descriptors in image processing. In order to identify objects in images effectively, gradient based edge features have been developed, which are edge orientation histogram [42], Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [43,44], co-occurrence HOG (CoHOG) [45], multilevel edge energy features [46], shapelets [47], and edge density [48]. The HOG method distributes the gradients into several orientation bins. HOG encapsulates changes in the magnitude and orientation of contrast over a grid of small image patches. HOG features have shown satisfactory performance in their ability to recognize a range of different object types including natural objects as well as artificial objects. CoHOG (Co-Occurrence Histograms of Oriented Gradients), an extension of HOG to represent the spatial relationship between gradient orientations, has been proposed and its effectiveness for pedestrian detection, human detection and medical image analysis has been demonstrated in [49–51].According to a review [52], the extraction of basic features in images is based on two mathematical concepts: differential geometry and scale-space theory. The differential geometry approach uses the assumption that features can be obtained from the image based on local anisotropic variations of pixel intensities. This concept is strong and effective. Recently, the differential feature extraction approaches have attracted more attentions [53,54]. Among the different feature extraction methods, gradient-based methods were widely used in the past. These methods are effective in defining and describing significant image features. Hessian matrix information is a robust differential method and it has been widely used in many publications to extract the image features [55,56]. Compared with the conventional gradient, the Hessian matrix and its Eigen analysis are more reliable and robust in revealing the fundamental directions in data. In this study, we propose four novel methods to improve the classification performance of the HOG and CoHOG algorithms. The proposed four methods are based on Gaussian derivatives filters and Hessian matrix. Instead of using the conventional gradient operator in HOG and CoHOG algorithms, the second-order partial derivatives in Gaussian derivatives filters and Hessian matrix are more proper and stable to calculate the intensity and texture variations of image surface.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will give a review of the original HOG and CoHOG algorithms. Section 3 presents the proposed new HOG and CoHOG algorithms based on Gaussian derivatives filters, Hessian matrix and Gaussian–mean curvatures. In Section 4, we test the performance of novel feature extraction algorithms on four standard texture datasets and discuss the effect of the normalization step on the classification performance. In Section 5, a series of rotation analysis experiments are performed. Furthermore, the characteristics of proposed descriptors are discussed in detail. The comparison results with the state-of-the-art the texture classification methods performed on Brodatz and UIUC datasets are shown in Section 6. The conclusions are given in Section 7.
