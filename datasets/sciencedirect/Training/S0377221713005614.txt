@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider a p-norm linear discrimination model that generalizes the model of Bennett and Mangasarian (1992) and reduces to a linear programming problem with p-order cone constraints. The proposed approach for handling linear programming problems with p-order cone constraints is based on reformulation of p-order cone optimization problems as second order cone programming (SOCP) problems when p is rational. Since such reformulations typically lead to SOCP problems with large numbers of second order cones, an “economical” representation that minimizes the number of second order cones is proposed. A case study illustrating the developed model on several popular data sets is conducted.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Consider two discrete setsA,B⊂Rncontaining k and m points, respectively:A={a1,…,ak},B={b1,…,bm}. One of the principal tasks arising in machine learning and data mining is that of discrimination of such sets, namely, constructing a surfacef(x)=0such thatf(x)<0for anyx∈Aandf(x)>0for allx∈B. Of particular interest is the linear separating surface (hyperplane):f(x)=w⊤x-γ=0. From the simple fact that any two pointsy1,y2∈Rnsatisfying the inequalitiesw⊤y1-γ>0,w⊤y2-γ<0for somewand γ are located on the opposite sides of the hyperplanew⊤x-γ=0, it follows that the discrete setsA,B⊂Rnare considered linearly separable if and only if there existw∈Rnsuch thatw⊤ai>γ>w⊤bjfor alli=1,…,k,j=1,…,m, with an appropriately chosen γ, or, equivalently,(1)minai∈Aai⊤w>maxbj∈Bbj⊤w.Clearly, existence of such a separating hyperplane is not guaranteed (namely, a separating hyperplane exists if the convex hulls of setsAandBare disjoint); thus, in general, a separating hyperplane that minimizes some sort of misclassification error is desired.In the next section we introduce a new linear separation model that is based on p-order cone programming, and discuss its key properties. The proposed solution approach, based on a reformulation of p-cone programming problems as second order cone programming (SOCP) problems when p is rational, is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains a case study on several popular data sets that illustrates the developed discrimination model.Since definition (1) involves strict inequalities, it is not well suited for mathematical programming models of selecting the “best” linear separator. However, the fact that the separating hyperplane can be scaled by any non-negative factor allows one to formulate the following observation:Proposition 1Bennett and Mangasarian, 1992Discrete setsA,B⊂Rnrepresented by matricesA=(a1,…,ak)⊤∈Rk×nandB=(b1,…,bm)⊤∈Rm×n, respectively, are linearly separable if and only if(2)Aw⩾eγ+e,Bw⩽eγ-eforsomew∈Rn,γ∈R,whereeis the vector of ones of an appropriate dimension,e=(1,…,1)⊤.Given the linear separability condition (2), the (non-negative) vectorsxA=(-Aw+eγ+e)+,xB=(Bw-eγ+e)+, wheret+=max{0,t}, represent misclassification errors:xAand/orxB>0if setsAandBare not linearly separable. If one considers that points of setsAandBrepresent realizations of (discretely distributed) random vectorsa,b∈Rn, respectively, the corresponding elements of vectorsxA,xBmay be regarded as realizations of random variablesXA(a;w,γ)=(-a⊤w+γ+1)+,XB(b;w,γ)=(b⊤w-γ+1)+, respectively, that depend parametrically on the decision variableswand γ. Then, a plausible strategy for selectingwand γ is one that minimizes, for example, the expected misclassification errors, and which can be formulated as the following stochastic programming problem:min(w,γ)∈Rn+1δ1E(-a⊤w+γ+1)++δ2E(b⊤w-γ+1)+,whereδ1,2serve as “importance” weights of the misclassification errors for points of setsAandB, respectively. Further, instead of minimizing the expected misclassification error, one may select the parameterswand γ so as to minimize the risk of misclassification. As it is well known in stochastic optimization and risk analysis, the “risk” associated with random outcome of a decision under uncertainty is often attributed to the “heavy” tails of the corresponding probability distribution. The risk-inducing “heavy” tails of probability distributions, are, in turn, characterized by the distribution’s higher moments. Thus, if the misclassifications introduced by a separating hyperplane can be viewed as “random”, the misclassification risk may be controlled better if one minimizes not the average, or expected misclassification errors, but their moments of orderp>1. This gives rise to the following formulation for linear discrimination of setsAandB:(3)min(w,γ)∈Rn+1δ1‖(-a⊤w+γ+1)+‖p+δ2‖(b⊤w-γ+1)+‖p,p∈[1,+∞],where‖·‖pis the usualLpnorm:‖Y‖p=(E|Y|p)1/pifp∈[1,∞), and‖Y‖∞=esssup|Y|. Ifaandbare uniformly distributed with support setsAandB, respectively:(4)P(a=ai)=1/k,P(b=bj)=1/mforallai∈A,bj∈B,the p-norm linear discrimination problem takes the form(5)min(w,γ)∈Rn+1δ1k1/p‖(-Aw+eγ+e)+‖p+δ2m1/p‖(Bw-eγ+e)+‖p,where‖·‖pis a norm in Euclidean space of an appropriate dimension:‖u‖p=(|u1|p+⋯+|ul|p)1/p,p∈[1,∞)and‖u‖∞=maxi=1,…,l{ui}(in the sequel, it shall be clear from the context whether theLpor Euclidean p-norm is used). Further, (5) can be formulated as a p-order cone programming problem (pOCP)(6a)minδ1k-1/pξ+δ2m-1/pη(6b)s.t.ξ⩾‖y‖p,(6c)η⩾‖z‖p,(6d)y⩾-Aw+eγ+e,(6e)z⩾Bw-eγ+e,(6f)z,y⩾0.Note that the special case ofp=1andδ1=δ2corresponds to the linear discrimination model of Bennett and Mangasarian (1992). The p-cone programming linear separation model (3)–(6) shares many key properties with the LP separation model of Bennett and Mangasarian (1992), including the guarantee that an optimal solution of (6) is non-zero inwfor linearly separable sets.Proposition 2When setsAandB, represented by matricesAandB, are linearly separable, the separating hyperplanew∗⊤x=γ∗given by an optimal solution of(5) and (6)satisfiesw∗≠0.Zero optimal value of (6a) entails that-Aw∗+eγ∗+e⩽0,Bw∗-eγ∗+e⩽0at optimality, which requires thatγ∗⩽-1andγ∗⩾1simultaneously forw∗=0to hold.□Secondly, the p-norm separation model (6) can produce a solution withw=0only in a rather special case that is identified by Theorem 1 below.Theorem 1Consider the p-order cone programming problem(6) and (5), where it is assumed without loss of generality that0<δ1⩽δ2. Then, for anyp∈(1,∞)the p-order cone programming problem(6)has an optimal solution withw∗=0if and only if(7a)e⊤kA=v⊤B,wheree⊤v=1,v⩾0,‖v‖q⩽δ2δ1m1/p,where q satisfiesp-1+q-1=1. In other words, the arithmetic mean of the points inAmust be equal to some convex combination of points inB. In the case ofδ1=δ2condition(7a)reduces to(7b)e⊤kA=e⊤mB,i.e., the arithmetic means of the points of setsAandBmust coincide.First, let us consider the case when the p-cone discrimination model (6) has an optimal solution withw∗=0and demonstrate that (7) must then hold. From the formulation (5) of problem (6) it follows that in the case whenw=0at optimality, the corresponding optimal value of the objective (6a) is determined asminγ∈Rδ1k1/p∑i=1k(1+γ)+p1/p+δ2m1/p∑j=1m(1-γ)+p1/p=2δ1,due to the assumption0<δ1⩽δ2. Next, consider the dual of the p-cone programming problem (6):(8)maxe⊤u+e⊤vs.t.-A⊤u+B⊤v=0,e⊤u-e⊤v=0,0⩽u⩽-s,0⩽v⩽-t,‖s‖q⩽δ1k-1/p,‖t‖q⩽δ2m-1/p,where q is such that1/p+1/q=1. Note that (6) is strictly feasible and bounded from below, since for anyw0,γ0andε>0one can selecty0=εe+(-Aw0+eγ0+e)+>0,z0=εe+(Bw0-eγ0+e)+>0,ξ0=(1+ε)‖y0‖p>‖y0‖p>0, andη0=(1+ε)‖z0‖p>‖z0‖p>0that are feasible to (6). Thus, the duality gap for the primal–dual pair of p-order cone programming problems (6) and (8) is zero (Nesterov & Nemirovski, 1994). Then, from the first two constraints of (8) we haveA⊤u∗=B⊤v∗as well ase⊤u∗=e⊤v∗, which, given that the optimal objective value of (8) is2δ1, implies that an optimalu∗must satisfy(9a)e⊤u∗=δ1.Also, from (8) it follows that(9b)‖u∗‖q⩽δ1k-1/p.Then, it is easy to see that the unique solution of system (9) isu∗=δ1ke=δ1k,…,δ1k⊤,which corresponds to the point where the surface(u1q+⋯+ukq)1/q=δ1k-1/pis tangent to the hyperplaneu1+⋯+uk=δ1in the positive ofRk.Likewise, an optimalv∗must satisfye⊤v∗=δ1and‖v∗‖q⩽δ2m-1/p, but suchv∗is not unique in the caseδ2/δ1>1. By substituting the obtained characterizations foru∗andv∗in the constraintA⊤u∗=B⊤v∗of the dual, we obtain (7a). Whenδ1=δ2, the optimalv∗is unique:v∗=δ1me, and yields (7b).To prove the statement of the Theorem in the opposite direction, assume that, for instance, (7a) holds for certainuandv. Selectingu∗=(δ1/k)e,v∗=δ1v, ands∗=-u∗,t∗=-v∗, it is easy to see that(u∗,v∗,s∗,t∗)represents a feasible solution of the dual problem (8) with the dual cost of2δ1. Similarly, the tuple(w∗,γ∗,y∗,z∗,ξ∗,η∗), wherew∗=0,γ∗=1,y∗=(eγ∗+e)+=2e,z∗=(-eγ∗+e)+=0,ξ∗=‖y∗‖p=2k1/p,η∗=‖z∗‖p=0, represents a feasible solution of the primal problem (6) with the corresponding objective value of2δ1. Noting the zero duality gap for the constructed pair of feasible solutions of (6) and (8), and recalling that the primal problem is bounded and strictly feasible, we immediately obtain that this pair of primal–dual solutions is optimal (Nesterov & Nemirovski, 1994). Hence, from (7a) it follows that an optimal solution of (6) exists withw∗=0.□Observe that Theorem 1 implies that in the case ofδ1=δ2, the p-norm discrimination model (6) produces a null separating hyperplane only when the “geometric centers” of the setsAandBcoincide. In practice, this means that such sets cannot be efficiently separated, at least by a hyperplane, thus an occurrence of aw∗=0solution in (6) may be regarded not as a shortfall of formulation (6), but rather as the general unsuitability of such setsAandBto linear discrimination. In the case ofδ1<δ2, occurrence of aw∗=0solution in (6) does not necessarily signify that setsAandBare hardly amenable to linear separation. In this case Theorem 1 only claims that the “geometric center” ofAmust lie within the convex hull of setB, so that linear discrimination can still be a feasible approach, albeit at a cost of significant misclassification errors.In order for aw∗=0solution to occur only under the stricter condition (7b) when misclassification preferences for setsAandBare different, the p-norm linear discrimination model can be extended by applying norms of different orders to misclassifications of points inAandB:(10)min(w,γ)∈Rn+1k-1/p1‖(-Aw+eγ+e)+‖p1+m-1/p2‖(Bw-eγ+e)+‖p2,p1,2∈(1,∞).Intuitively, a norm of higher order places more “weight” on the outliers. For example, use ofp=1norm entails minimization of the average of misclassifications; in contrast, application of thep=∞norm implies minimization of the largest misclassification for a set. Thus, by selecting appropriately the ordersp1andp2in (10) one may introduce tolerance preferences on misclassifications of points of setsAandB. At the same time, it can be shown that the occurrence ofw∗=0solution in (10) would signal the presence of the aforementioned singularity about the setsAandB. Namely, we haveTheorem 2The p-order cone programming problem(10), wherep1,p2∈(1,∞), has an optimal solution withw∗=0if and only if(7b)holds.We conclude this section by pointing out a connection between the p-norm separation model and the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. SVM models are widely used in classification problems (see some recent works in, e.g., Carrizosa & Morales, 2013; Khemchandani, Jayadeva, & Chandra, 2009; Trafalis & Gilbert, 2006). The linear SVM for non-separable sets can be written as a quadratic programming problem of the form(11a)min12‖w‖2+C1e⊤ε1+C2e⊤ε2(11b)s.t.Aw-eγ⩾e-ε1(11c)-Bw+eγ⩾e-ε2(11d)ε1,2⩾0whereε1andε2are misclassification vectors for setsAandB, respectively, andC1,C2>0.Proposition 3If the misclassification weight coefficients in the p-norm separation model(6)and the SVM model(11)coincide,C1=δ1/k1andC2=δ2/k2, the optimal valueVSVM∗of SVM problem(11)can be bounded asVp∗⩽VSVM∗⩽Vp∗+12‖w∗‖2,whereVp∗is the optimal value of p-norm problem(6)andw∗is an optimal solution of(6).By renaming variablesε1=y,ε2=z, problem (11) can be rewritten as(12)min12‖w‖2+C1ξ+C2η|ξ⩾‖y‖1,η⩾‖z‖1,(6d),(6e),(6f).SettingC1=δ1/k,C2=δ2/mand taking into account that‖x‖p⩾‖x‖qfor1⩽p<q, it is easy to see that12‖w∗‖2+C1ξ∗+C2η∗⩾12‖w∗∗‖2+C1ξ∗∗+C2η∗∗⩾C1ξ∗∗+C2η∗∗⩾C1ξ(1)∗+C2η(1)∗⩾C1ξ∗+C2η∗,wherew∗∗,ξ∗∗,η∗∗are the optimal values of the variables in the SVM problem (12),w∗,ξ∗,η∗are optimal solutions of the p-norm separation model (6), andξ(1)∗,η(1)∗are optimal solutions of (6) withp=1.□In the next section we discuss the details of practical implementation of the p-norm linear discrimination model (6).The p-order cone constraints (6b), (6c) are central to practical implementation of the p-norm separation method (6). In the special cases ofp=1orp=∞,p-order cone constraints reduce to linear inequalities; specifically, thep=1version of model (6) has been studied in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992). In general, the amenability of 1-norm to implementation via linear constraints has been exploited in a variety approaches and applications, too numerous to cite here. Another prominent special case is that ofp=2, when (6b), (6c) represent second order, or quadratic cones. The second order cone programming (SOCP) constitutes a well-developed subject of convex optimization, and a number of efficient self-dual “long-step” interior point (IP) SOCP algorithms have been developed in the literature and implemented in software (Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Andersen, Roos, & Terlaky, 2003; Sturm, 1998). The “general” case ofp∈(1,2)∪(2,∞), when the p-cone is not self-dual, has received relatively limited attention in the literature. IP approaches to p-order cone programming have been considered in, e.g., Xue and Ye (2000), Nesterov (2012), and Glineur and Terlaky (2004); a polyhedral approximation approach was proposed in Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010).In this work, we pursue an approach to solving p-cone programming problems that is based on the possibility to represent a p-order cone via a sequence of second order cones when p is rational (Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Nesterov & Nemirovski, 1994). Reformulation of a rational-order p-cone programming problem as a SOCP problem allows for employing the efficient self-dual SOCP methods, albeit at a cost of a large number of second order cones required for such a reformulation. Moreover, since such a reformulation is not unique, in Section 3.2 we introduce a constructive “economical” representation of rational-order p-cones via second order cones.Without loss of generality, consider a p-cone in the positive orthant ofRn+1(13)t⩾w1p+⋯+wnp1/p,(t,w1,…,wn)⊤⩾0.In the case when the parameter p is a positive rational number,p=r/s, wherer,s∈N, then, for instance, the following “lifted” representation of the p-cone set (13) can be constructed inR+2n+1(Alizadeh & Goldfarb, 2003; Krokhmal & Soberanis, 2010):(14a)t⩾u1+⋯+un,uj⩾0,j=1,…,n,(14b)wjR⩽ujstr-swR-r,j=1,…,n,whereR=2ρ,ρ=⌈log2r⌉. Then, each nonlinear inequality (14b) can equivalently be replaced by a sequence of three-dimensional (3D) rotated quadratic conesz2⩽xy; such a representation, however, is not unique. Observe that each side of inequalities (14b) contains2ρfactors; this allows one to construct a lifted representation for (14b) via2ρ-13D rotated quadratic cones using the “tower of variables” technique (Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 2001):(15a)w2⩽vρ-1,1vρ-1,2(15b)vl,i2⩽vl-1,2i-1vl-1,2i,i=1,…,2ρ-l,l=2,…,ρ-1,(15c)v1,i2⩽u2,i=1,…,⌊s/2⌋,(15d)v1,i2⩽ut,i=⌊s/2⌋+1,…,⌈s/2⌉,(15e)v1,i2⩽t2,i=⌈s/2⌉+1,…,⌊r/2⌋,(15f)v1,i2⩽tw,i=⌊r/2⌋+1,…,⌈r/2⌉,(15g)v1,i2⩽w2,i=⌈r/2⌉+1,…,⌊R/2⌋,w,vl,i,u,t⩾0,where subscripts j are suppressed for brevity. The set of inequalities (15) can be visualized as a binary tree whose nodes represent the variables in (15). Each inequality in (15) can then be viewed as a subgraph with two arcs that connect the “parent” node (the variable at the left-hand side of the inequality) to the two “child” nodes (the variables at the right-hand side of the same inequality). Given this binary structure, the set of second order cones in (15) can be regarded as partitioned intoρlevels indexed by l, where the variable w in (15a) constitutes the root node of the tree, and belongs toρ-level, while variablesu,t,win (15c)–(15g) represent the leaf nodes, or 0-level nodes of the tree.In Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010) it has been shown that among the2ρ-1inequalities (15) there are onlyO(ρ)=O(log2r)non-degenerate second order cones, while the rest reduce to linear inequalities that can be omitted. The following bounds on the number of non-degenerate quadratic cones in (15) follow directly from the arguments in Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010):Proposition 4(Krokhmal & Soberanis, 2010).When p is a positive rational number,p=r/s, such thatr>sand the greatest common divisor of r and s is 1, a p-order cone in the positive orthant ofRn+1can equivalently be represented byCpthree-dimensional quadratic cones, whereCpsatisfies(16)nρ⩽Cp⩽n(2ρ-1),ρ=⌈log2r⌉.It it easy to see that the order in which the variablesu,t, and w are assigned to the leaf nodes in the binary tree (15) can significantly affect the number of non-degenerate quadratic cones needed to represent a rational-order p-cone inRn+1. As an illustration, consider the casep=3; direct application of (15) yieldsρ=2,R=4, and a representation ofp=3cone (13) that involves3n3D rotated quadratic cones:(17)t⩾u1+⋯+un;wj2⩽v1jv2j,v1j2⩽ujt,v2j2⩽twj,j=1,…,n.On the other hand, it is easy to verify that reordering the leaf nodes inequalities (15c)–(15g) allows for reducing the number of 3D quadratic cones necessary to represent ap=3cone inR+n+1to 2n:(18)t⩾u1+⋯+un;wj2⩽tvj,vj2⩽ujwj,j=1,…,n.Observe that the number of second order cones in representations (17) and (18) correspond to the upper and lower bounds in (16), respectively.Since a reduction in the number of second order cone inequalities in (15) leads to a reduction in the number of quadratic cones representing a rational-order p-cone (13) by the order of dimensionality n of the p-cone, it is of interest to devise an “economical” second order cone representation of rational-order cones.Below we demonstrate that the lower bound onCpin (16) is achievable for any rationalp⩾1. To this end, consider the following convex pointed cone inR+4:(19)P=y∈R+4y0k0-y1k1y2k2y3k3⩽0,that satisfies the next four properties:(P1)k0,k1,k2,k3∈Z+;k0=k1+k2+k3;k1+k2+k3=2qfor some integerq⩾1;exactly two numbers amongk1,k2, andk3are odd.ConeP(19)that satisfies (P1)–(P4) can be represented as an intersection of at most q three-dimensional cones of the formx∈R+3x32⩽x1x2.The process of building such a representation ofPis based on successive lifting ofPinto spaces of dimensions greater than previous by 1, in such a way that the degree of the polynomial in (19) is reduced in half each time. First, assume thatk1,k3,k3>0are all different, andq⩾2. Without loss of generality, letk1,k2be odd and such thatk2>k1, and consider the following set inR+5:(20)P∗=y∈R+5y0ν0-y4ν4y2ν2y3ν3⩽0,y42⩽y1y2,whereν0=k0/2,ν2=(k2-k1)/2,ν4=k1,ν3=k3/2.It is easy to see that any(y0,…,y3)∈Pcan be extended to(y0,…,y4)∈P∗, and any(y0,…,y4)∈P∗is such that(y0,…,y3)∈P. Ask1andk2are odd and positive integers by assumption, due to (P4)k3is even, whenceν3is a positive integer. The above assumption also implies thatk2-k1is even, meaning thatν2is a positive integer. Similarly,ν0is integer andν0=2q-1. Also, observe thatν1+ν2+ν3=(k1+k2+k3)/2=k0/2=ν0. So, the first cone in (20) satisfies properties (P1)–(P3). Next, observe thatν4=k1is odd, thus out of two integersν2,ν3exactly one should be odd forν2+ν3+ν4=2q-1to hold. Thus, condition (P4) holds as well.Note that if in our assumptionk1=k2, thenν2=0in (20), but all conditions still hold. Consider the case whenq⩾2and one ofk1,k2,k3is zero, assume it isk3. Thenk1,k2should be odd by (P4). Performing the same transformation, we obtain(21)P∗∗=y∈R+5y0ν0-y4ν4y2ν2⩽0,y42⩽y1y2,ν0=k0/2,ν2=(k2-k1)/2,ν4=k1.The first cone ofP∗∗still has Properties (P1)-(P4), and(y0,…,y3)∈Pcan be extended to(y0,…,y4)∈P∗∗, and any(y0,…,y4)∈P∗∗is such that(y0,…,y3)∈P.Ifq=1, then one ofk1,k2,k3is zero, and two others are necessarily equal to 1. In this casePis already a quadratic cone. Thus, the above lifting transformation can be carried out no more thanq-1times, and the conic setP(19) can be represented by at most q quadratic cones using at mostq-1new variables.□With the help of Proposition 5 we can now establish the following result on second order cone representation of rational-order p-cones:Theorem 3Letp>1be a positive rational number,p=r/s, where the greatest common divisor of r and s is 1. Then a p-order cone in the positive orthant ofRn+1can equivalently be represented byn⌈log2r⌉three-dimensional rotated quadratic cones.In accordance to (13)–(14), the problem of representing a(r/s)-cone inR+n+1via second order cones can be reduced to finding a second order cone representation of n sets of the form(22)Q=y∈R+3y3R-y1sy2r-sy3R-r⩽0,whereR=2ρ,ρ=⌈log2r⌉. Observe that coneQis equivalent to intersection of coneP(19), wherek1=s,k2=r-s,k3=R-r, with a hyperplaney0=y3. Indeed, Properties (P1)-(P3) are obvious, and (P4) holds since if r and s do not have common divisor greater than 1, neither dor-sand s, wherebyr-sand s cannot be both even.Note that an iteration of the lifting procedure described in Proposition 5 corresponds to a specific order in which the variables at some level of the binary tree are arranged. For example, the first iteration of lifting corresponds to arranging the 0-level variables{w,t,u}={y1,y2,y3}in pairs corresponding to second order cone constraints, such thaty1andy2makek1pairs, ory42⩽y1y2non-degenerate cones; the remainingk2-k1variablesy2form(k2-k1)/2pairs, or degenerate conesy4′2⩽y22, andk3variablesy3formk3/2pairs, or degenerate conesy4″2⩽y33, assuming thatk1<k2are odd. Obviously, the degenerate cones can simply be disregarded.Hence, by Proposition 5,Qadmits representation by at mostρ=⌈log2r⌉second order cones; combining this with Proposition 4, one obtains that each of n sets of the formQadmits representation using exactlyρ=⌈log2r⌉second order cones.□It is well known that second order cone sets admit an equivalent semidefinite representation in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In general, p-order cones are not LMI-representable in the space of original variables (see an example forp=4cone in Helton & Vinnikov, 2007; Helton & Nie, 2010), but admit lifted LMI representations.Corollary 1Conic setQ(22)admits a lifted representation in the form of LMIQ∗=y∈R+ρ+2∑i=1ρ+2Aiyi⪰0,whereAi∈R2ρ×2ρare symmetric matrices, in the sense that the projection ofQ∗onto the space of variables(y1,y2,y3)coincides withQ.In this section we report computational results on using the p-norm discrimination model (5) and (6) for linear separation of sets. In particular, we employ the presented above “economical” SOCP reformulation approach to solving pOCP problem (6) in the case when p is rational, and compare it with the polyhedral approximation technique of Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010).In our computational experiments we used three data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The first data set is Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set with a total of 683 instances and 9 attributes. It contains 444 instances with benign diagnosis and 239 instances with malignant diagnosis. The second data set, Cleveland Heart Disease data set, contains 281 instances with 13 attributes, of them 125 instances correspond to positive diagnosis and 156 instances correspond to negative diagnosis. Finally, the Pima Indians Diabetes data set reports 768 instances with 8 attributes, including 266 instances of positive diagnosis and 502 instances of negative diagnosis. Both the Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Cleveland Heart Disease data sets (in their then-up-to-date versions) were used in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992).For each data set, training and testing was performed by randomly selecting 100 training sets with equal number of points of both types, and testing the obtained separator on the data not included in the training set. For computational purposes, the data in training data sets was normalized and scaled by a factor of 104; the same transformation was then applied to testing data. After the training and testing procedures were performed, the average misclassification error on testing set was computed. It is important to comment on selection of parameter p in (6): as a general rule that follows from our numerical experiments and is consistent with the motivation presented in Section 2, smaller values of p (aroundp=2) are beneficial for well-separable data sets with smaller misclassification errors, whereas larger values ofp⩾3allow for reducing large misclassification errors in linear separation. With this in mind, a particular value of p can be selected during the training procedure.Table 1reports the average out-of-sample misclassification error for each data set, together with the respective “best” value of p at which this error was obtained. It also includes results for the cases ofp=1, which corresponds to minimization of the average of misclassifications due to Bennett and Mangasarian (1992),p=∞, corresponding to minimization of the largest misclassification errors, and SVM model (11). Figs. 1–3illustrate the behavior of the misclassification error in the described data sets with respect to the value of parameter p in (5) and (6), which was varied in the range of 1.0–4.0 with a 0.1 step. As it follows from Table 1 and Figs. 1–3, the p-norm separation model (5) and (6) withp>1allows for an improved classification accuracy as compared to the cases ofp=1proposed in Bennett and Mangasarian (1992), the SVM model (11), and the worst-error approach ofp=∞.In addition to classification capabilities of the p-norm linear separation model (5) and (6), its computational properties were investigated. In particular, for all the data sets described above we compared the running times of the cutting plane procedure for polyhedral approximations of problem (6) due to Krokhmal and Soberanis (2010), denoted as LP/CP, and the “economical” SOCP reformulation of (6), along with the corresponding results for SVM model (11) andp=∞case. All models were coded in C++ and CPLEX 12.2 solver was used to solve the resulting LP, SOCP, and QP problems. A dual-core 3GHz CPU computer with 2GB of RAM was used to run the computations. Fig. 4illustrates corresponding running times on the example of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set, along with the values of the parameterρ=⌈log2r⌉, wherep=r/s, which is proportional to the number of second order cones in the SOCP reformulation of rational-order p-cone programming problem (6). From Fig. 4 it follows that the solution times for SOCP reformulation of a rational-order p-cone programming model (6) are highly correlated to the number of second order cones in the reformulated problem. On the other hand, solution times of a polyhedral approximation of (6) solved with a cutting plane method (LP/CP) exhibit relatively little dependence on the value of the parameter p, and are competitive with the running times of the SVM model. Computational performance of the considered models on other data sets is very similar to that presented in Fig. 4.
