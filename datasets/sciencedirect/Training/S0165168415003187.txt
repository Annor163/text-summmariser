@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is one of the most useful tools for the nonstationary signal processing. In this paper, the randomized nonuniform sampling and approximate reconstruction of the nonstationary random signals in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD) are developed. The nonuniform samples are treated as random perturbations from a uniform grid. The samples used for the sinc interpolation reconstruction are placed on another nonuniform grid which is not necessarily equal to the samples originally acquired. When considering the second-order random statistic characters, the nonuniform sampling is equivalent to the uniform sampling of the signal after a pre-filter in the FRFD, where the frequency response is related to the characteristic function (with its argument scaled bycscα) of the perturbations. The effectiveness of the reconstruction is analyzed and the mean square error (MSE) is computed by utilizing the equivalent filter system. Furthermore, the randomized reconstruction of the chirp period stationary random signal is proposed. At last, the minimum MSE on the special cases of the randomized sampling and reconstruction is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction method is verified by the simulation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As the nonstationary signals, especially for the chirp signals, have compact support in the fractional Fourier domain (FRFD), the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) became a powerful tool in the nonstationary signal processing [1–3]. The FRFT is a generalized form of the Fourier transform (FT), and its properties have been derived in a number of research papers [4–8]. The sampling theorem of the nonstationary signals plays an important role in digital signal processing, and arouses researchful interest in the literatures. The expansions of the uniform sampling theorem about the nonstationary signals in the FRFD have been investigated in [9–13].Shannon sampling theorem is the classical uniform sampling theorem. However, sometimes samples cannot be collected uniformly in a variety of applications, such as in the fields of synthetic aperture Radar (SAR), astronomies and geophysics. The issue of approximate reconstruction using nonuniform samples or its transformed version has attracted much attention in the signal processing community [14–21]. Yao and Thomas [14] stated that when the sampling instantstndid not derived by more thanT/4from a uniform grid with spacing of T, the bandlimited signal in the Fourier domain (FD) could be completely reconstructed by the Lagrange interpolation. The generalized nonuniform sampling theorem similar to [14] was also derived in the FRFD [15]. The complexity of the Lagrange interpolation motivated other much simpler approximate reconstruction methods. Tao et al. [17] derived the periodic nonuniform sampling and reconstruction in the FRFD at first, and other early works on nonuniform sampling and reconstruction in the FRFD were developed in [18–21]. These sampling theorems verified that if a signal was bandlimited or compact in a FRFD, it could be sampled by using the FRFT instead of the FT with a larger sampling interval. In fact, some signals have random characters. Some related results on random variables and fractional stationarity concepts in the FRFD were derived in [22–26]. The above generalized sampling theorems are suitable for the class of deterministic signals which have compact support in the FRFD. The reference [27] derived the sampling methods for random signals with known spectral densities in the mean square sense, including uniform and nonuniform sampling. The sampling theorem in the FRFD and its relation to the von Neumann ergodic theorem were also discussed in [28].The reconstructions of the signals from nonuniform samples are more difficult to complete than that from uniform samples, and the complexity of the implementation of the nonuniform sampling theorem makes it difficult to be used in practice [15]. Although the periodic nonuniform sampling is a quite fascinating sampling theorem, not all of the nonuniform sampling cases can be modeled by it. In this paper, we propose a randomized nonuniform sampling and approximate sinc interpolation reconstruction method for the chirp stationary signals, which are nonstationary in the usual sense or in the FD [25]. The nonuniform samples are regarded as random perturbations from a uniform sampling grid in the analysis. Therefore, the nonuniform sampling sequence has random characters. On the basis of the second-order statistic theory, the randomized nonuniform sampling is equivalent to the uniform sampling of the signal after a pre-filter. The pre-filter is a fractional multiplicative filter, whose frequency response is the characteristic function (with its argument scaled bycscα) of the random sampling perturbations. Thus, the randomized sampling and approximate reconstruction can be considered by an equivalent filter system. The mean square error (MSE) which represents the performance of the reconstruction is analyzed by the equivalent system. Furthermore, the case of the chirp period stationary random signal is developed. Special cases of the sinc interpolation reconstruction are discussed and simulated at last.The paper is organized as follows: the preliminaries are reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, for nonstationary signals, nonuniform sampling with random perturbations and approximate reconstruction are proposed. Then the error of the reconstruction is analyzed in detail. Section 4 investigates the randomized sinc interpolation reconstruction of the chirp period stationary signals, which can be implemented by a finite summation. The special cases and simulation results of the reconstruction are discussed in Section 5. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.The FRFT of a signal x(t) with angle α is defined as [1](1)Xα(u)=Fα[x(t)](u)=∫−∞∞x(t)Kα(t,u)dt,where(2)Ka(t,u)={Aαej(1/2)(t2+u2)cotα−jutcscα,α≠nπδ(t−u),α=2nπδ(t+u),α=(2n±1)π,andAα=(1−jcotα)/2π. Obviously, the FRFT reduces to the identity transform and the conventional FT forα=0andα=π/2, respectively. The relationship between the FRFT and the FT is proposed in [6] as(3)Fα[x(t)](u)=Aαej(1/2)u2cotα·Fπ/2[ej(1/2)t2cotα·x(t)](ucscα),whereFπ/2denotes the FT operation.E{·}is used to denote the mathematical expectation. For a zero-mean random signal x(t), if the autocorrelation function of the signal does not change over time, i.e.Rxx(t1,t2)=Rxx(τ)|τ=t1−t2, the signal is said to be wide sense stationary or stationary for short. The fractional autocorrelation function is defined as [22](4)Rxxα(t1,t2)=E{x(t1)x⁎(t2)ejt2(t1−t2)cotα}=Rxx(t1,t2)ejt2(t1−t2)cotα,where the superscript ⁎ means the conjugate operation. It is clear that when the signal x(t) is nonstationary,Rxxα(t1,t2)is also related to the instant time. If the chirp modulated formx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαof the signal x(t) is stationary, i.e.Rx˜x˜(t1,t2)=Rx˜x˜(τ)|τ=t1−t2, the signal x(t) is called the α chirp stationary signal. The definition results from the fact thatRxxα(t1,t2)=Rx˜x˜(t1,t2)e(−j(1/2))(t1−t2)2cotα, i.e.Rxxα(t1,t2)=Rxxα(τ)|τ=t1−t2, which has been discussed in the reference [28]. The fractional power spectral densityPxxα(u)and the fractional correlation function form a FRFT pair [22], i.e.(5)Pxxα(u)=A−αFα[Rxxα(τ)](u)·e−j(1/2)u2cotαand(6)Rxxα(τ)=∫−ururPxxα(u)ejuτcscαe−j(1/2)τ2cotαdu.In particular, whenα=π/2, (5) becomes the Wiener–Khinchine theorem and (6) is the standard autocorrelation function.For the multiplicative filterhα(t)in the FRFD, let x(t) and y(t) be the random input and output of the filter,Pxxα(u)andPyyα(u)be the fractional power spectrums of x(t) and y(t), respectively. We have the following input–output relationships [22,27]:(7)Fα[y(t)](u)=Fα[x(t)](u)·Hα(u),and(8)Pyyα(u)=|Hα(u)|2Pxxα(u),whereHα(u)is the frequency response of the fractional filter, andhα(t)=F−π/2[Hα(u)](tcscα).A random signal x(t) is bandlimited in the αth FRFD if its fractional power spectral density satisfies [27](9)Pxxα(u)=0,|u|>ur,whereuris the bandwidth of the signal in the FRFD. Whenα=π/2, the random signal is bandlimited in the FD.First, a useful conclusion associated with the fractional bandlimited random signal is shown here for convenience.Lemma 1Assume a zero-mean nonstationary random signal x(t) is bandlimited tourin the αth FRFD, if its phase modulated signalx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαis stationary,x˜(t)is a signal bandlimited tourcscαin conventional FD (or frequency domain).Based on the definition of the fractional autocorrelation function (4), we have that [22](10)Rxxα(τ)=Rx˜x˜(τ)e−j(1/2)τ2cotα|τ=t1−t2.According to the relationship between the correlation function and the power spectral densityPx˜x˜(u)=(1/2π)∫−∞∞Rx˜x˜(τ)ejuτdτ, by utilizing (5), it is easy to obtain(11)Pxxα(u)=2πA−αAαPx˜x˜(ucscα).BecausePxxα(u)is bandlimited tour, the power spectral densityPx˜x˜(ucscα)of the signalx˜(t)is bandlimited tourcscα.□For the nonstationary signal x(t) which is bandlimited tourin the αth FRFD, the general nonuniform sampling theorem shows that if the sampling instants meet the following constraint [15]:(12)|tn−nTN|≤d<TN4,d∈R,whereTN=π/(urcscα)is the Nyquist sampling interval, the original signal can be reconstructed by the Lagrange interpolation formula as(13)x(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−∞∞x(tn)ej(1/2)tn2cotαG(t)G′(tn)(t−tn),where(14)G(t)=eat(t−t0)∏n≠0(1−ttn)et/tn,a=∑n≠01tn,andG′(tn)is the derivative of G(t) evaluated att=tn.From the above description, the reconstruction of the fractional bandlimited signal from the nonuniform samples using the Lagrange interpolation requires a lot of computations as the interpolating functions have different forms at different sampling times. Motivated by the complexity of the implementation and the strict condition of (12), a simpler approximate reconstruction method will be developed in this paper. Before analyzing the reconstruction formula, the nonuniform sampling model is established first.The zero-mean α chirp stationary random signal x(t), which is bandlimited in the FRFD, is analyzed in the following. The nonuniform sampling sequence of x(t) is denoted asx[n], i.e.x[n]=x(tn). The set{tn}represents the nonuniform sampling grid which is modeled as random perturbations from a uniform grid, i.e.tn=nT+ξn, which is described in Fig. 1. Where T denotes the average sampling interval and will be assumed not to exceed the Nyquist sampling interval in this paper, i.e.T≤TN.{ξn}is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence with zero mean in the intervalξn∈(−T/2,T/2). The probability density function (PDF) of the random variableξnisfξ(ξ). One natural distribution ofξnis uniform distribution, i.e.fξ(ξ)=1/T,ξ∈(−T/2,T/2), and∫−T/2T/2fξ(ξ′)dξ′=1. It is also possible to imagine a truncated Gaussian distribution or other bounded distribution. The randomized sampling can be represented in Fig. 2.Firstly, from the perspective of the second-order statistics analysis, the following theorem can be derived.Theorem 1For a zero-mean α chirp stationary random signal x(t), which is bandlimited in the FRFD, the nonuniform sampling with random perturbations of the signal can be equivalently represented by the uniform sampling after a pre-filterhα(t)shown inFig. 3with respect to the second-order statistics, where the filter ishα(t)=F−π/2[Hα(u)](tcscα), T is the uniform sampling interval,tn=nT+ξnis the sampling instant time, v(t) is the zero-mean additive noise and uncorrelated with x(t). The fractional power spectral density of v(t) isPvvα(u)=Pxxα(u)(1−|Hα(u)|2), andv[n]=v(tn).From the definition of the α chirp stationary signal, we know that the signalx˜(t)=x(t)e(1/2)jt2cotαis stationary. The randomized sampling can be represented by the form in Fig. 4. According to the fractional multiplicative filter, the input–output relationship of the fractional power spectrum in Fig. 3 is(15)Pyyα(u)=|Hα(u)|2Pxxα(u).As v(t) is the zero-mean additive noise and uncorrelated with x(t), the autocorrelation function ofz[n]is equivalent to that ofy[n]. By utilizing the formula (6), the fractional autocorrelation function ofz[n]is expressed as(16)Rzzα(nT,(n−k)T)=∫−ururPxxα(u)|Hα(u)|2ejukTcscαe−j(1/2)(kT)2cotαdu.Therefore,(17)Rz˜z˜(nT,nT−kT)=Rzzα(nT,nT−kT)ej(1/2)(kT)2cotα=∫−ururPxxα(u)|Hα(u)|2ejukTcscαdu.On the other hand, because both ofx(tn)andξnare random variables, the autocorrelation function ofx[n]is given by(18)Rxxα(tn,tn−k)=E{Rxxα(kT+ξn−ξn−k)}=∫−ururPxxα(u)E{eju(kT+ξn−ξn−k)cscαe−j(1/2)(kT+ξn−ξn−k)2cotα}du.Asx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαis a stationary random signal, by utilizing (10), the autocorrelation function ofx˜[n]is(19)E{Rx˜x˜(kT+ξn−ξn−k)}=E{Rxxα(kT+ξn−ξn−k)ej(1/2)(kT+ξn−ξn−k)2cotα}.Using Eq. (6), the above formula can be rewritten as(20)E{Rx˜x˜(kT+ξn−ξn−k)}=∫−ururPxxα(u)ejukTcscαE{eju(ξn−ξn−k)cscα}du.Based on the definition of the PDF, for the two i.i.d. random variables X and Y, the PDF ofZ=X+Yis the convolution of the PDFs of X and Y, i.e.(21)fZ(z)=fX⊙fY(z),where ⊙ is the classical convolution operation. As the perturbations ξnare i.i.d. random variables, the PDF of the termZ=ξn−ξn−kcan be obtained as(22)fZ(ξ)=fξn−ξn−k(ξ)=fξ(ξ)⊙fξ(−ξ).According to the definition of the mathematical expectationE{X}=∫−∞∞xfX(x)dx, we have the result that(23)E{eju(ξn−ξn−k)cscα}=∫−∞∞ejuξcscαfZ(ξ)dξ=∫−∞∞ejuξcscα[fξ(ξ)⊙fξ(−ξ)]dξ.The characteristic function of the random perturbations is defined as(24)ϕξ(u)=∫fξ(ξ′)ejuξ′dξ′,which is the FT of the PDF. By using the convolution theorem, the autocorrelation function in (20) can be deduced as(25)E{Rx˜x˜(kT+ξn−ξn−k)}=∫−ururPxxα(u)ejukTcscα∫−∞∞ejuξcscα[fξ(ξ)⊙fξ(−ξ)]dξdu=∫−ururPxxα(u)|ϕξ(ucscα)|2ejukTcscαdu.Obviously, when the frequency response of the fractional filter equals to the characteristic function (with its argument scaled bycscα) of the random perturbations, i.e.Hα(u)=ϕξ(ucscα), Eq. (17) is equivalent to (25) which indicates that the autocorrelation function of the samplesx˜[n]in Fig. 4 is identical to that of the output in the system of Fig. 3.Hence, in the sense of second-order statistic characters, the nonuniform sampling with random perturbations can be equivalent to the uniform sampling in the system of Fig. 3.□According to Theorem 1, the PDFfξ(ξ)can be designed to makeϕξ(ucscα)act as an equivalent anti-aliasing low-pass filter in Fig. 3. Correspondingly, the random perturbations can still manifest themselves through the additive noise. Thus, the system in Fig. 3 suggests that aliasing can be traded off with uncorrelated noise by an appropriate design of the PDF of the random sampling perturbations.The reconstructions of the signals from nonuniform samples are more difficult to complete than that from uniform samples which have been explained before. In the case of uniform sampling, the Lagrange interpolation reduces to the sinc interpolation. Motivated by the fact that the sinc interpolation results in perfect reconstruction for uniform sampling, the approximate reconstruction of bandlimited random signal x(t) (in the FD) from its nonuniform samples using randomized sinc interpolation is expressed as [29](26)x^(t)=TTN∑n=−∞∞x(tn)·h(t−t˜n),whereh(t)=sinc(t·π/TN),π/TNis the bandwidth of the signal x(t), and the samples used in the sinc interpolation are placed on the nonuniform gridt˜n=nT+ζnwhich is not necessarily equal to the samples originally acquired. However, the theorem may lead to the wrong conclusion for the signal which is nonbandlimited in the FD, such as the chirp signals. As the nonbandlimited signals in the FD may be bandlimited in the FRFD for a certain value of angle α, the signal reconstruction by randomized sinc interpolation in the FRFD need to be proposed.Theorem 2Let a zero-mean α chirp stationary random signal x(t) is bandlimited tourin the FRFD, the approximate reconstruction of x(t) from its nonuniform samples using randomized sinc interpolation is(27)x^(t)=TTNe−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−∞∞x(tn)ej(1/2)tn2cotα·h(t−t˜n),n∈Z,whereh(t)=sinc(urtcscα), T denotes the nominal sampling interval,TNis the Nyquist sampling interval,{tn}is the sampling instants sequence, and the samples used for interpolation are placed on another nonuniform gridt˜n=nT+ζnthat is not necessarily equal to the samples originally acquired, i.e.ζnis not necessarily same asξn.As the random signal x(t) is α chirp stationary, its phase modulated signalx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαis stationary. As x(t) is bandlimited tour,x˜(t)is bandlimited tourcscαin the FD from the Lemma 1. Thus, the signalx˜(t)can be reconstructed by the randomized sinc interpolation based on Eq. (26),(28)x¯(t)=TTN∑n=−∞∞x˜(tn)·sinc((t−t˜n)π/TN),where T denotes the nominal sampling interval,TNis the Nyquist sampling interval,urcscα=π/TNis the bandwidth of the signalx˜(t). The instant times aretn=nT+ξnandt˜n=nT+ζn, whereξnandζnare random perturbations of sampling and reconstruction, respectively. It is worth noting thatx¯(t)=x^(t)ej(1/2)t2cotα. And then substitutingx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαand its bandwidthurcscαinto Eq. (28), (27) can be derived.Theorem 2 shows that the reconstruction using the sinc interpolation with another randomized nonuniform grid can be represented as the system in Fig. 5. Nevertheless, the reconstruction with randomized sinc interpolation is an approximate method. How to evaluate the performance of the method will be given in the next section.We consider the performance of the reconstruction from the perspective that the sampling and reconstruction process can be equivalent to the system whose frequency response is related to the PDF of the perturbations. Based on Theorem 1, the system in Fig. 6is equivalent to the process which consists of nonuniform sampling discussed in Section 3.1 and the randomized sinc interpolation suggested in Fig. 5 in the sense of second-order statistics, when the average sampling rate meets or exceeds the Nyquist rate. In detail, the frequency response of the fractional filter can be obtained asϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα), which is the joint characteristic function of the random perturbationsξnandζn. In addition, v(t) is the zero-mean additive colored noise and uncorrelated with the original signal, with power spectrum:(29)Pvv(u)=T2π∫−ururPxxα(u1)[1−|ϕξζ(u1cscα,−u)|2]du1,|u|<ur.The equivalence will be proved afterward.We denotee(t)=x^(t)−x(t)as the error between x(t) and its approximationx^(t)obtained by the reconstruction with randomized sinc interpolation. The MSE of the randomized approximate reconstruction will be derived by the power spectrums of the original signal and the reconstruction according to the system in Fig. 6.From Theorem 2, we havex¯(t)=(T/TN)∑n=−∞∞x˜(tn)·h(t−t˜n). The autocorrelation function ofx¯(t)is(30)Rx¯x¯(t,t−τ)=E{TTN∑n=−∞∞x˜(tn)·h(t−t˜n)·TTN∑k=−∞∞x˜⁎(tk)·h⁎(t−τ−t˜k)}=(TTN)2E{∑n=−∞∞x˜(nT+ξn)·h(t−nT−ζn)·∑k=−∞∞x˜⁎(kT+ξk)·h⁎(t−τ−kT−ζk)}=(TTN)2∑n=−∞∞∑k=−∞∞E{Rx˜x˜(nT−kT+ξn−ξk)·h(t−nT−ζn)h⁎(t−τ−kT−ζk)}.Furthermore, the above equation can be represented by the sum of the following two terms:(31)Rx¯x¯(t,t−τ)=(TTN)2Rx˜x˜(0)∑n=−∞∞E{h(t−nT−ζn)h⁎(t−τ−nT−ζn)}+(TTN)2∑n≠kE{Rx˜x˜(nT−kT+ξn−ξk)h(t−nT−ζn)·h⁎(t−τ−kT−ζk)}.Expressing h(t) byH(u)using their FT pair relationship(32)∑n=−∞∞E{h(t−nT−ζn)h⁎(t−τ−nT−ζn)}=(12π)2∫∫H(u1)H⁎(u2)ej(u1−u2)teju2τ·∑nej(u2−u1)nT·E{ej(u2−u1)ζn}du1du2,and by utilizing the following Poisson summation equivalent formula:(33)∑ne(j(u2−u1)nT)=2π∑kδ((u2−u1)T−2πk),the first term of Eq. (31) is derived as(34)(TTN)2Rx˜x˜(0)∑n=−∞∞E{h(t−nT−ζn)h⁎(t−τ−nT−ζn)}=12π(TTN)2Rx˜x˜(0)∫−urcscαurcscα1T|H(u)|2ejuτdu.The second term can be simplified as (the detailed calculating process is given in Appendix A)(35)(TTN)2∑n≠kE{Rx˜x˜(nT−kT+ξn−ξk)h(t−nT−ζn)h⁎(t−τ−kT−ζk)}=∫−urcscαurcscαejuτ·[Px˜x˜(u)|ϕξζ(u,−u)|2−T2π∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u1)|ϕξζ(u1,−u)|2du1]du.Substituting (34) and (35) into (31) results in(36)Rx¯x¯(t,t−τ)=∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u)|ϕξζ(u,−u)|2ejuτdu+T2π∫−urcscαurcscα(∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1,−u)|2)du1)·ejuτdu.Similar to the calculation in Appendix A, the cross-correlation function ofx¯(t)andx˜(t)can be expressed as(37)Rx¯x˜(t,t−τ)=∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u)·ϕξζ(u,−u)·ejuτdu.Hence, the corresponding power spectrums of the autocorrelation function and cross-correlation function can be obtained as(38)Px¯x¯(u)=Px˜x˜(u)|ϕξζ(u,−u)|2+T2π∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1,−u)|2)du1,and(39)Px¯x˜(u)=Px˜x˜(u)·ϕξζ(u,−u).From the above theoretical results, it is clear that the first term in (38) is the power spectrum ofy˜(t)in the system of Fig. 6, when the frequency response of the filter isϕξζ(u,−u). The power spectrum of v(t) given in (29) is the same as the second term of (38). Therefore, the randomized sampling and approximate reconstruction process of the original signal can be equivalent to the system in Fig. 6 with respect to the second-order statistic character of the power spectrum.Based on Eq. (11), the fractional auto-power spectrum can be obtained:(40)Px^x^α(u)=2πAαA−αPx¯x¯(ucscα)=2πAαA−αPx˜x˜(ucscα)|ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)|2+T·AαA−α·∫−urcscαurcscαPx˜x˜(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1,−ucscα)|2)du1=Pxxα(u)|ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)|2+Tcscα2π∫−ururPxxα(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1cscα,−ucscα)|2)du1.As the fractional cross-correlation function has the similar definition and properties with (11) of the fractional autocorrelation function [22], the cross-power spectrum can be expressed as(41)Px^xα(u)=2πAαA−αPx¯x˜(ucscα)=2πAαA−αPx˜x˜(ucscα)·ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)=Pxxα(u)·ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα).Consequently, the power spectrum of the reconstruction error in Fig. 6 is(42)Peeα(u)=Px^x^α(u)−Px^xα(u)−Pxx^α(u)+Pxxα(u)=Pxxα(u)|ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)|2+Tcscα2π∫−ururPxxα(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1cscα,−ucscα)|2)du1−Pxxα(u)·ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)−[Pxxα(u)·ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)]⁎+Pxxα(u)=Pxxα(u)|1−ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)|2+Tcscα2π∫−ururPxxα(u1)(1−|ϕξζ(u1cscα,−ucscα)|2)du1.The MSE is given by integrating the power spectrum of the error over frequency(43)E{e2(t)}=∫−ururPeeα(u)du=∫−ururPxxα(u)|1−ϕξζ(ucscα,−ucscα)|2du+Tcscα2π∫−ururPxxα(u)∫−urur(1−|ϕξζ(ucscα,−u1cscα)|2)du1du.From the result of (43), the MSE depends on the fractional power spectrum of the original signal and the joint characteristic function of the perturbations. Designing the optimal joint characteristic function can reduce the MSE.The randomized nonuniform sampling and reconstruction for the chirp stationary signal in the FRFD has been obtained in the above section. From (27), the reconstruction can be regarded as the weighted summation of an infinite number of shifted sinc functions. The numerical implementation of this method on a computer is not possible because an infinite number of samples are needed. Moreover, only a finite number of samples can be acquired in the practical applications, which will not make the reconstruction as perfect as possible [30–32]. Masry [32] has analyzed the truncation error of the sampling expansion for the stationary bandlimited processes in detail. Nevertheless, for a special class of signals, i.e. the stationary random signals with periodicity, there is a similar but interesting reconstruction method. In this section, we will consider the randomized reconstruction of the chirp stationary random signal with periodicity, which is widely used in some important applications, especially in analyzing and processing the information got from the period time-varying character. Furthermore, we will investigate that this kind of reconstruction can be rewritten as a finite summation, which will avoid the error caused by the truncation.For the more detailed analysis, we firstly develop the definition of the chirp period stationary random signal, which is similar to the definition of the chirp period deterministic signal in the FRFD [12], i.e. a random signal x(t) is said to be α chirp period stationary with periodTpif its phase modulated signalx˜(t)=x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotαis stationary and(44)x(t)ej(1/2)t2cotα=x(t+Tp)ej(1/2)(t+Tp)2cotα.Apparently the fractional autocorrelation function of the random signal also has the chirp period property with periodTp, i.e.(45)Rxxα(τ)ej(1/2)τ2cotα=Rxxα(τ+Tp)ej(1/2)(τ+Tp)2cotα.We consider the period random sampling sequencex(tn)=x(nT+ξn), which satisfies the following property:(46)x(nT+ξn)ej(1/2)(nT+ξn)2cotα=x(nT+ξn+Tp)ej(1/2)(nT+ξn+Tp)2cotα.For simplicity, the sampling intervalT=TN=1will be used and the reconstruction formula (27) is obtained as(47)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−∞∞x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα·sin(πt−nπ−ζnπ)πt−nπ−ζnπ.Further simplification is possible if the following equation is used:(48)sin(πt−nπ−ζnπ)=(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ).As a result, (47) is rewritten as(49)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−∞∞x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα·(−1)nπsin(πt−ζnπ)t−n−ζn.For the α chirp stationary random signal x(t) with finite samplesN0in one period, from [15], rearranging the summation in (49), we obtain(50)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑k=−∞∞∑n=−L+kN0M−1+kN0x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα·(−1)nπsin(πt−ζnπ)t−n−ζn=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑k=−∞∞∑n=−LM−1x(n+kN0+ξn+kN0)ej(1/2)(n+kN0+ξn+kN0)2cotα·(−1)n+kN0πsin(πt−ζn+kN0π)t−n−kN0−ζn+kN0,where L and M are arbitrary integers that obey the relationL+M=N0. If the random perturbations meet the conditionsξn+kN0=ξnandζn+kN0=ζn, and the sampling sequence is periodic with periodN0, the reconstruction formula can be simplified as(51)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑k=−∞∞∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα·(−1)n+kN0πsin(πt−ζnπ)t−n−kN0−ζn.Exchanging the summation, formula (51) can be rewritten as(52)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ)π·∑k=−∞∞1t−n−kN0−ζn,N0even,(53)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ)π·∑k=−∞∞(−1)kt−n−kN0−ζn,N0odd.As the inner summations are the decompositions into partial fraction of cotangent and cosecant, respectively, (52) and (53) can be rewritten as(54)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ)N0·cot(πt−n−ζnN0),N0even,(55)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ)N0·csc(πt−n−ζnN0),N0odd.By utilizing the trigonometric relations, the above two formulas can be joined into one equation as(56)x^(t)=e−j(1/2)t2cotα∑n=−LM−1x(n+ξn)ej(1/2)(n+ξn)2cotα(−1)nsin(πt−ζnπ)2N0·[(−1)N0+1tan(πt−n−ζn2N0)+cot(πt−n−ζn2N0)].The analysis in this section can be concluded as Theorem 3.Theorem 3For the zero-mean chirp period stationary random signal with periodTp=N0T, which is bandlimited in the FRFD, the original signal can be approximately reconstructed by the sinc interpolation placed ont˜n=nT+ζnfrom the finite random nonuniform samples attn=nT+ξn,n=1,2,…,N0. The reconstruction formula is presented as (56), which is a finite summation that can be implemented by the computer.
