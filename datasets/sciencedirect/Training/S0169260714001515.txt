@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes new combined methods to classify normal and epileptic seizure EEG signals using wavelet transform (WT), phase-space reconstruction (PSR), and Euclidean distance (ED) based on a neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM). WT, PSR, ED, and statistical methods that include frequency distributions and variation, were implemented to extract 24 initial features to use as inputs. Of the 24 initial features, 4 minimum features with the highest accuracy were selected using a non-overlap area distribution measurement method supported by the NEWFM. These 4 minimum features were used as inputs for the NEWFM and this resulted in performance sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.33%, 100%, and 98.17%, respectively. In addition, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to measure the performances of NEWFM both without and with feature selections.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Human brain disorders are responsible for many physiopathological diseases, especially epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that is generally characterized by sudden and recurrent seizures [10,13,20]. Until recently, the occurrence of an epileptic seizure was unpredictable and its mode of action was little understood [9].The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a highly complex signal and it provides one of the most commonly used information sources for studying brain function and neurological disorders [2]. Study of the brain's electrical activity, using electroencephalographic records, is one of the most important steps in the diagnosis of neurological diseases [1,14,31,32,41].EEG signal processing uses nonlinear methods, such as the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension is used to measure the complexity or degree of the EEG signal disorder [8,13,23]. Apart from EEG, Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was developed specifically for nonlinear and nonstationary signal analysis [36]. Time and frequency domains are commonly used in feature extraction methods for the EEG signals and cross-correlations of EEG time series have been used for high performance classification of the time domain features [7,12,15,45,51]. Past research shows that, to analyze the frequency domain features, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was applied first followed by the calculation of power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals [15,34]. Grammatical evolution (GE) [35,44], eigenvector methods [12,49,50], and the Fourier transform [39] are also other reported approaches for extracting features when classifying epileptic signals from the EEG recordings.EEG signals have been decomposed into timeâ€“frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [5,11]. First, EEG signals are decomposed into several sub-signals by DWT, and then wavelet coefficients of the several sub-signals are produced. The wavelet coefficients were used as inputs of Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [11]. Genetic programming is applied to extract new features, which are nonlinearly transformation from the wavelet coefficients [9]. Wavelet entropy was obtained from the wavelet coefficients on the several sub-signals, and then the wavelet entropy was used as features [20]. Statistical methods were also used to extract features from the wavelet coefficients [46]. Certain features based on DWT were obtained and applied as different classifiers during epileptic EEG classification, including methods, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference [11], relative wavelet energy (RWE) with artificial neural network (ANN) method [26], multistage approach for clustering [16], new phase space-based approach to automatically classify sleep-wake cycle [4], mixture of expert model [46] and support vector machine (SVM) [7].In the current study, a neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM) [21,22,24] that is known to deliver excellent performance in prediction and classification was used to classify the normal and the epileptic seizure signals from the EEG signals and 3 preprocessing steps were implemented for this purpose. The 3 preprocessing steps, applied sequentially, comprised of wavelet transform (WT), phase-space reconstruction (PSR), and Euclidean distance (ED). NEWFM and non-overlap area distribution measurement method were used for classification and feature selection. In this regard, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to compare the performances of NEWFM without feature selection and NEWFM with feature selection.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related works. Section 3 describes EEG datasets used in this paper. Section 4 describes feature extraction and selection method. Section 5 provides experimental result. Discussion and conclusion have been included in Section 6.
