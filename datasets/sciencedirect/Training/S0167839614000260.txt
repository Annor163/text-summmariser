@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In Winkel (2001) a generalization of Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves based on umbral calculus has been introduced. In the present paper we describe new geometric and algorithmic properties of this generalization including: (1) families of polynomials introduced by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985), i.e., families that include both Bernstein and Lagrange polynomial, are generalized in a new way, (2) a generalized de Casteljau algorithm is discussed, (3) an efficient evaluation of generalized Bézier curves through a linear transformation of the control polygon is described, (4) a simple criterion for endpoint tangentiality is established.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
For the vector spacesR⩽n[t]of polynomials in t of degree ⩽n many different bases are known and in use where every basis has its advantages and disadvantages.The monomialstk(0⩽k⩽n)are popular because of easy elementary arithmetic operations. However, coefficients do not carry much obvious geometric meaning. When geometrically intuitive approximation properties and numeric stability are required, the Bernstein polynomials of degree n(1.1)Bkn(t):=(nk)tk(1−t)n−kfor0⩽k⩽nare a much better choice due to the classical work of Bernstein, Bézier and de Casteljau (see Farin, 2001; Farouki, 2012 for general information, Farouki, 1991a; Farouki and Rajan, 1988 for algorithms, and Farouki and Rajan, 1987; Farouki, 1991b; Farouki and Goodman, 1995 for numerical stability).A control polygonC(b)is described by a sequence ofn+1control points(b0,…,bn)inRNsuch that successive control points are connected by straight line segments. Then a “good” polynomial approximation of this control polygon is given by the Bézier curve(1.2)x(t)≡x(t;b):=∑k=0nbkBkn(t)(0⩽t⩽1).“Good” means that the Bézier curvex(t)starts atb0and ends atbnin a tangential fashion and follows the course of the control polygon in variation diminishing way. Since the Bézier curve can be intuitively controlled by moving the control points and since there are several efficient evaluation algorithms – de Casteljau, subdivision, blossoming – available, Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves are the cornerstone of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) (Farin, 2001).However, if the control points are assumed to be fixed for some reason, e.g., in data smoothing, the geometric connection between the control polygon and its Bézier curve is also fixed. Therefore several generalizations that allow a more flexible response of the resulting curve on the control points have been introduced. Most prominent are certainly rational Bézier curves that change the response of the curve to the fixed control points by weighting the control points. Since this approach does not permit changing the resulting curve in a uniform way – one point can only gain attraction at the cost of others – families of polynomials that interpolate between Bernstein and Lagrange polynomials have been invented: the polynomials by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985) reappearing as h-Bernstein bases in Simeonov et al. (2011). These families are further generalized by Farin and Barry (1986) and Barry and Goldman (1991). A generalization of the Bernstein–Lagrange family in a completely different direction is achieved by the generalized Bernstein polynomials introduced in Winkel (2001) (see Theorem 2.1 below).But first of all let us recall the definition of generalized Bernstein polynomialsBkn(t;a¯)of degree n:(1.3)Bkn(t;a¯):=1ρn(nk)pk(t)pn−k(1−t),wherepkandpn−kinR[t]are polynomials of degree k andn−k, respectively, that replace the monomialstkand(1−t)n−kin the definition of Bernstein polynomials,a¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)(a¯1≠0)are real parameters which determine the shape ofpkandpn−k, and1/ρnis a normalizing factor. Of course,pkandpn−knot only have the right degree, but are chosen such that the crucial property of partition of unity(1.4)1=∑k=0nBkn(t)of Bernstein polynomials is preserved which guarantees affine invariance. Since (1.4) for Bernstein polynomials follows immediately from the binomial formula(x+y)n=∑k=0n(nk)xkyn−kby settingx=tandy=1−t, the following generalized binomial formula(1.5)pn(x+y)=∑k=0n(nk)pk(x)pn−k(y)for a sequence of polynomials(pn)n∈Nwithdeg(pn)=nwould yield the desired generalization of Bernstein polynomials: To get the generalized Bernstein polynomials of (1.3) just take the summands of (1.5), setx=tandy=1−t, and divide byρn:=pn(1)(if ≠0).Do polynomials exist that fulfill (1.5)? The study of binomial polynomials that fulfill (1.5) is at the center of the Umbral Calculus founded by John Blissard in the 1850's (Bell, 1938) and revived by Gian-Carlo Rota and Steven Roman in the 1970's (Roman and Rota, 1978; Roman, 1984, 1992). In fact, one can find such polynomials for every sequencea¯of real parameters. In order to make the present paper self-contained some crucial formulas are repeated here.For the n-tuplea¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)of real numbers one defines the Bell polynomials (Comtet, 1974; Roman and Rota, 1978) by(1.6)pn(t)≡pn(t;a¯)=∑k=1npn,ktkwith(1.7)pn,k≡pn,k(a¯)=1k!∑i1+⋯+ik=ni1,…,ik>0(ni1,…,ik)a¯i1⋯a¯ik.The recursion(1.8)pn,k+1=1k+1∑j=1n−k(nj)a¯jpn−j,kallows a fast calculation.The notationa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)with the bars is chosen to conform with the established notation in umbral calculus. There one starts with a real formal power seriesf(t)=∑n=1∞ann!tn,wherea1≠0, i.e., with a delta series. For every delta series there exists a second delta series(1.9)f¯(t)=∑n=1∞a¯nn!tnthat is the compositional inverse of f with(f¯∘f)(t)=(f∘f¯)(t)=tand that is used as a generating function for a sequence of associated polynomialspn(x)(1.10)exf¯(t)=∑n=0∞pn(x)n!tn.Clearly, the generalized Bernstein polynomials contain the Bernstein polynomials as a special case:Bkn(t)=Bkn(t;(1,0,…,0)).Given a feasible parameter sequencea¯∈Rn(such thatρn=pn(1)≠1) and a sequence of control pointsb=(b0,…,bn)the evaluation of generalized Bézier curves(1.11)x(t;a¯)≡x(t;a¯;b):=∑k=0nbkBkn(t;a¯)(0⩽t⩽1),via formulas (1.8), (1.6) and (1.3) (in this order) is however quite cumbersome, in particular, the final evaluation of (1.11). At first sight the fast algorithms available for the evaluation of Bernstein polynomials do not seem to have a counterpart in the generalized case. However, in Section 4 we show that the generalized Bézier curve can be computed as an (ordinary) Bézier curve of a certain lineara¯-transformation of the control polygonC(b). The examples from Winkel (2001) are revisited in the light of this new computational approach.We emphasize once more that our generalized Bernstein polynomials and generalized Bézier curves are completely in line with the direction of development that began with the rational case, namely, fix the control points and change the polynomials to get a different response of the resulting curve to the control polygon. The transformation of the control polygonC(b)is not visible and relevant for the designer or data analyst who manipulates the responsiveness of the curve via parameters. In Section 2 we show that the generalized Bernstein polynomials include as special cases the Lagrange and the h-Bernstein polynomials. There we introduce the “responsiveness” c that controls as a master parameter all single parameters ofa¯simultaneously (Theorem 2.1). Moreover, we show by example of the “Bernstein–Lagrange family” how the parameter sequencea¯controls the geometry of the generalized Bézier curves, thereby pointing out a direction in which to proceed with further investigations on the geometric meaning of different parameter sequences. As a starting point for this investigation we give a summary of simple properties of generalized Bernstein polynomials:•Bkn(0)=δk,0andBkn(1)=δn,0imply endpoint interpolation,symmetry:Bkn(t)=Bn−kn(1−t),affine invariance by the partition of unity property,non-negativity of parameters or more generally non-negativity of the generalized Bernstein polynomials on the interval[0,1]implies the convex hull property,if interpolation is desired, the convex hull property cannot be fulfilled and therefore at least one parameter must be negative,variants of generalized Bernstein polynomials that are “stiffer” than the ordinary Bernstein polynomials, e.g., whenc<0in Theorem 2.1, or simply when all parameters are non-negative (by the optimality of Bernstein polynomials), have the variation-diminishing property,for every fixed degreen⩾4there exist parameter sequences different from(1,0,…,0)that imply tangency at endpoints (Theorem 5.5).In Section 3 we generalize the de Casteljau algorithm along the lines of umbral calculus and in Section 5 we explore some algebraic and geometric properties of the parameter sequencesa¯and the transformation matrixM(a¯).We finally remark that the different q-generalization of Bernstein polynomials fit well into the umbral calculus based framework as displayed here, but we defer the investigation of this topic to another paper.If the parameter sequencea¯is chosen suitably one gets the Lagrange polynomials. With an additional “master” parameter c one gets a whole family of generalized Bernstein polynomials that interpolates between Bernstein and Lagrange polynomials. This family is identical with the ones described by Stancu (1968) and Goldman (1985) and reappears in Simeonov et al. (2011) as h-Bernstein bases. The further generalizations of these families by Farin and Barry (1986) and Barry and Goldman (1991) are completely different from our approach. In the following theorem one sees that the “master parameter” c controls the parameter sequencea¯(c)as a whole and the casesc=0, 1 and −∞ suggest to calling it the responsiveness of the generalized Bézier curves.Theorem 2.1Fora¯(c):=(a¯1(c),…,a¯n(c))witha¯i(c):=(−1)i−1(cn)i−1(i−1)!one gets for•c=0the Bernstein basisBkn(t;a¯(0))=Bkn(t)c=1the Lagrange polynomialsBkn(t;a¯(1))=Lkn(t)of order n with equidistant nodesti=i/nfori=0,…,n0<c<1a continuous transition between Bernstein and Lagrange casec<0andc→−∞the Bézier curve settles at the straight line fromb0tobn1<c<nn−1“blow up” of the generalized Bézier curve from the interpolating curve to the straight line frombnto ∞ tob0nn−1<c<nn−2,nn−2<c<nn−3,…,n3<c<n2the curves cycles between “blow up's”n2<candc→∞the curve settles at the straight line fromb0tobnUmbral calculus (Roman, 1984) shows the “classical” fact thatf¯(t)=α−1log(1+t)=1α∑i=1∞(−1)i−1iti=:∑i=1∞a¯ii!tiis the generating function of the lower factorial polynomialspn(x)=xα(xα−1)⋯(xα−n+1)=∏k=0n−1(xα−k)whose coefficients in the monomial basis are the Stirling numbers of the first kind. The substitutiont=αsrescales the lower factorial polynomials such thatexf¯(t)=exf¯(αs)=∑n=0∞αnpn(x)n!snwithαnpn(x)=∏k=0n−1(x−αk).Settingα=1nfor some fixedn∈Nnow gives the polynomialspn(x)=∏k=0n−1(x−kn)for the parameter sequencea¯=(a¯1,a¯2,…)witha¯i:=(−1)i−11ni−1(i−1)!.Now for thisa¯one computes withρn=pn(1)=n!nnthe generalized Bernstein polynomialsBkn(t;a¯)=1ρn(nk)pk(t)pn−k(1−t)=nnk!(n−k)!∏i=0k−1(t−in)∏j=0n−k−1(1−jn−t)=nn(−1)n−kk!(n−k)!∏i=0k−1(t−in)∏j=0n−k−1(t−(1−jn))=∏i=0i≠knt−inkn−in=Lkn(t).Ifh(c)is any continuous function on[0,1]⊂Rwithh(0)=0andh(1)=1, then the substitutionα=h(c)nyields parametersa¯i(h(c)):=(−1)i−1(h(c)n)i−1(i−1)!such that forc=0one gets Bernstein polynomials and forc=1Lagrange polynomials.To keep things as simple as possible we make the choiceh(c):=c. Then the substitutionα=cnyields the parameter sequencea¯(c)=(a¯1(c),a¯2(c),…)witha¯i(c):=(−1)i−1(cn)i−1(i−1)!.The sequence of associated polynomial ispn(x;c):=∏k=0n−1(x−kcn)withρn(c):=pn(1;c)=∏k=1n−1(1−kcn)=(n−1)!(−1n)n−1∏k=1n−1(c−nk).The generalized Bernstein polynomials are then given byBkn(t;a¯(c))=1ρn(c)(nk)∏i=0k−1(t−icn)∏j=0n−k−1(1−jcn−t).WithB0n(t;a¯(c))=1ρn(c)∏j=0n−1(1−jcn−t)=∏j=0n−11−jcn−t1−jcn=(1−t)∏j=1n−1(1−t1−jcn)one sees thatlimc→±∞B0n(t;a¯(c))=1−tand similarlylimc→±∞Bnn(t;a¯(c))=t. By the partition of unity property of generalized Bernstein polynomials it follows thatlimc→±∞Bkn(t;a¯(c))=0fork=1,…,n−1and hence the continuous transition of the generalized Bézier curve to the straight line fromb0tobnforc=±∞.Sinceρn(c)has the zerosnn−1<nn−2<⋯<n2<ntheBkn(t;a¯(c))“blow up” to ∞ for these c's.In each of the intervalsnn−1<c<nn−2,nn−2<c<nn−3,…,n3<c<n2between the zeros ofρn(c)the generalized Bernstein polynomials behave differently. The key to understanding this behavior are the zeros of the generalized Bernstein polynomials, which we will investigate next.Let(2.1)R(a¯):=⋃k=0n{r∈R|Bkn(r;a¯)=0}be the set of zeros of the generalized Bernstein polynomialsBkn(t;a¯)for givena¯. In general|R(a¯(c))|=2nexcept for certain values of c where differentBkn(t;a¯(c))share zeros. This happens of course in the Bernstein case whereR(a¯(0))={0,1}and in the Lagrange case whereR(a¯(1))={i/n|i=0,…,n}, but also for other values of c (see Fig. 1(A)).Note that numbering the zeros for somec<0by1,2,…,2nin decreasing order as in Fig. 1(A) implies thatBkn(t;a¯(c))has exactly the zerosk+1,…,k+nfork=0,…,n– in Fig. 1(B) one sees the zero-contours3,4,5,6,7forB25(t;a¯(c)).Now forc=1=nna fixed zero is shared by all but one polynomial, forc=nn−1a fixed zero is shared by all but two polynomials, forc=nn−2a fixed zero is shared by all but three polynomials, etc., and at every new zero ofρn(c)two more zeros of theBkn(t;a¯(c))leave the interval[0,1].For fixed c the zeros of a singleBkn(t;a¯(c))determine the position, height and width of its global maximum (and minimum) and therefore the way the Bézier curve is built by theBkn(t;a¯(c))(see the subsequent example).  □Example 2.2Fig. 2shows a sequence of pairs of pictures of the generalized Bernstein polynomialsBk3(t;a¯(c))and their generalized Bézier curves for different values of c. The control polygon is always the positively oriented regular triangle with start and end point(1,0)∈R2. The blow-up values arec=1.5, where the Bézier curve leaves the origin in positive vertical direction and returns to the origin from the negative vertical direction, andc=3, where the Bézier curve leaves the origin in negative horizontal direction and returns to the origin from the positive horizontal direction.In fact, the Bézier curve stretches in the vertical direction forc=1.3due to the coupling of a big maximum ofB13with a big minimum ofB23and vice versa. Similarly, the Bézier curve stretches in negative horizontal direction forc=2.3due to the coupling of a big maximum ofB13with a big minimum ofB33and a big maximum ofB23with a big minimum ofB03.Forc=3.8the Bézier curve flips over into the positive horizontal direction due to the coupling of a big maximum ofB03with a big minimum ofB13and a big maximum ofB33with a big minimum ofB23.Remark 2.3The proof of Theorem 2.1 showed that the Lagrange polynomials are a “convolution” of the falling factorials. In an analogous way other classical sequences of associated polynomials like exponential polynomials, Gould polynomials, and Abel polynomials (see Roman, 1984) could be used to define corresponding generalized Bernstein polynomials. That this does not seem to lead to geometrically interesting families of polynomials is not surprising, because these polynomials have not been designed with a geometric but rather with combinatorial and other applications in mind. But the choice of the parameter sequencea¯of course leaves much room for geometric exploration.The de Casteljau algorithmbk0(t):=bk(k=0,…,n)bkr(t):=(1−t)bkr−1(t)+tbk+1r−1(t)(r=1,…,n;k=0,…,n−r)generates the Bézier curvex(t;b)=b0n(t)by repeated linear interpolation. It can be interpreted as an application of the recursion of Bernstein polynomials(3.1)Bkr(t)=(1−t)Bkr−1(t)+tBk−1r−1(t).Rewriting the recursion (3.1) withx=t,y=1−t,pk(t)=tkandBkn(y)=Bn−kn(x)one sees that the essential underlying identities arepk(x)pn−k(y)=(xpk−1(x))pn−k(y)=pk(x)(ypn−k(y))or independently of the variablepn(x)=xpn−1(x)forn∈N.This observation shows how to set up the recursion formula for generalized Bernstein polynomials and therefore how to generalize the de Casteljau algorithm appropriately:For a given parameter sequencea¯with generating functionf¯(t)the umbral shift operatorθfgenerates the sequence of associated polynomials ofpn(x)according to(3.2)pn+1(x)=θfpn(x)forn∈Nwhere f is the compositional inverse off¯. The general formula for the umbral shift is (Roman, 1984, Corollary 3.6.6)θfxpn(x)=xf′(f¯(t))pn(x)with t acting as differentiation according totp(x):=p′(x)on any polynomialp(x).Now withpk(x)pr−k(y)=(θfpk−1(x))pr−k(y)=pk(x)(θfpr−k(y))and the linearity ofθfthe recursion for generalized Bernstein polynomialsBkr(t;a)and therefore a generalized de Casteljau algorithm can be derived from(rk)pk(x)pn−k(y)=(r−1k)pk(x)(θfpr−1−k(y))+(r−1k−1)(θfpk−1(x))pr−k(y)=θfy(r−1k)pk(x)pr−1−k(y)+θfx(r−1k−1)pk−1(x)pr−k(y)whereθfxandθfyoperate on the variables x and y, respectively.In fact, in the case of ordinary Bernstein polynomialsf(t)=t=f¯(t),a¯=(1,0,0…),pn(x)=xnandf′(f¯(t))=1. Therefore we arrive at the recursion formula (3.1).Forf(t)=aαt−1one hasf¯(t)=α−1log(1+t)and the associated polynomialspn(x)are the lower factorials as discussed in Section 2. In this case one computesθfxpn(x)=x1αe−αt∏k=0n−1(xα−k)=xα∏k=0n−1(x−αα−k)=xα∏k=1n(xα−k)=∏k=0n(xα−k)sincee−αtacts as shift operator on the variable x according toe−αtp(x)=p(x−α). This gives – in a completely different way – the usual Aitken algorithm for the interpolation polynomial with equidistant nodes.All in all the approach to generalized Bernstein polynomials and generalized Bézier curves via umbral shifts leads to new theoretical insights and formulas, but concerning efficient evaluation it is in general too involved: executingθf, substitutingx=tandy=1−t, and normalizing by multiplication withρr−1. For applications in CAGD we propose therefore thea¯-transformation of the control polygon as discussed in the next section.Subsequently we use for fixedn∈Nthe vector notationB(t;a¯):=(B0n(t;a¯)B1n(t;a¯)⋯Bnn(t;a¯)),B(t):=(B0n(t)B1n(t)⋯Bnn(t)),t:=(1t⋯tn).Then the representation of the generalized Bernstein polynomials in powers of t is(4.1)B(t;a¯)=D(a¯)t(4.2)D(a¯)=(dk,j(a¯))∈R(n+1)×(n+1)with the rather unpleasant coefficients (Winkel, 2001, (4.10))(4.3)dk,j(a¯)=1ρn(nk)∑i=0min(j,k)(−1)j−ipk,i∑h=j−in−kpn−k,h(hj−i).One expects that expressing the generalized Bernstein polynomials in terms of Bernstein polynomials should lead to nicer coefficients, since they share the symmetry(4.4)Bkn(t;a¯)=Bn−kn(1−t;a¯).The representation of powers of t in Bernstein polynomials is(4.5)t=TB(4.6)T=(tk,j)∈R(n+1)×(n+1)with the well known coefficients (Comtet, 1974, (5.28))(4.7)tk,j≡tk,j[n]=(jk)(nk).Therefore the representation of generalized Bernstein polynomials in terms of Bernstein polynomials is(4.8)B(t;a¯)=M(a¯)B(t)(4.9)M(a¯):=D(a¯)T(4.10)M(a¯)=(mk,j(a¯))∈R(n+1)×(n+1)where a “nice” formula for the coefficientmk,j(a¯)ofBjn(t)inBkn(t;a¯)is to be determined – a direct evaluation of the matrix productD(a¯)Tdoes not look promising.Before doing this we make however a crucial observation on the impact of the last formula for generalized Bézier curves. Interpreting the sequence of control points as a matrixb=(b0,b1,…,bn)∈RN×(n+1)the definition (1.11) of generalized Bézier curves can be rewritten(4.11)x(t;a¯;b)=bB(t;a¯)(4.12)x(t;a¯;b)=bM(a¯)B(t).The following definitions are now natural.Definition 4.1For givenn∈Na sequence of real parametersa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)is called feasible, ifa¯1≠0andρn=pn(1)≠0wherepnis computed via (1.6)–(1.8).Definition 4.2For a given sequence of control pointsb=(b0,b1,…,bn)and a feasible sequence of parametersa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)the sequence of control pointsb(a¯)=(b(a¯)0,b(a¯)1,…,b(a¯)n)computed by(4.13)b(a¯):=bM(a¯)∈RN×(n+1)is called ana¯-transformation of b.C(b(a¯))is called thea¯-transformation of the control polygonC(b).Theorem 4.3The generalized Bézier curve for a given sequence of control pointsb=(b0,b1,…,bn)and a feasible sequence of parametersa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)can be computed as (ordinary) Bézier curve of thea¯-transformed sequenceb(a¯)of control points:(4.14)x(t;a¯;b)=x(t;b(a¯)).Immediate from (4.11)–(4.13) and the rewritten formula (1.1)x(t;b(a¯))=b(a¯)B(t).□Now the fast algorithms for the evaluation of Bézier curves can be put to use as soon as the matrixM(a¯)is computed. This can be done directly – without using (4.9) – with the formula given by the corollary of the following more general theorem whose proof is deferred to Appendix A:Theorem 4.4Given polynomialspk(t)=∑ν=0kpk,νtνandqk(t)=∑μ=0kqk,μtμfork=0,…,n, respectively. Then the “convoluted” polynomialsskn(t)below can be expressed as linear combination of Bernstein polynomials(4.15)skn(t):=(nk)pk(t)qn−k(1−t)=∑l=0nmk,lBln(t)with(4.16)mk,l=(nk)(nl)∑j=0kπk,jπn−k,n−k−l+j′(4.17)mk,l=(nk)(nl)∑i=0n−kπk,k+i+l−nπn−k,i′where(4.18)πn,k:=∑ν=0k(n−νn−k)pn,νandπn,k′:=∑ν=0k(n−νn−k)qn,ν.Corollary 4.5For a given feasible sequence of parametersa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)the matrixM(a¯)=(mk,l(a¯))∈R(n+1)×(n+1)from(4.10)for thea¯-transformation of control points can be computed by:(4.19)ρnmk,l(a¯)=(nk)(nl)∑j=0kπk,jπn−k,n−k−l+j(4.20)ρnmk,l(a¯)=(nk)(nl)∑i=0n−kπk,k+i+l−nπn−k,iwhere(4.21)πn,k:=∑ν=0k(n−νn−k)pn,νwithpn,0=δn,0(using the Kronecker symbol).Remark 4.6The matrix productM(a¯′)(M(a¯))−1transforms the control pointsb(a¯)fora¯directly to the control pointsb(a¯′)for some differenta¯′.Also – since the inverse of T is well known – the matrix productT−1(M(a¯))−1gives an explicit representation for the ordinary powers of t in terms of the generalized Bernstein polynomialsBkn(t;a¯).It would therefore be helpful to have a formula for the inverse matrix(M(a¯))−1(with unevaluated variablesa¯1,…,a¯n). However, there does not seem to exist such a simple formula.We revisit now some of the generalized Bézier curves from Winkel (2001) in the light of this new computational approach. Every picture below for a given parameter sequence shows four curves•the control polygonC(b)a regular n-gon starting at point(1,0), running counterclockwise, and ending at point(1,0)(thin line)the drop-like Bézier curvex(t;b)followingC(b)(dotted line)the generalized Bézier curvex(t;a¯;b)fora¯andC(b)(thick line)thea¯-transformed control polygonC(b(a¯))for whichx(t;a¯;b)is nothing but the ordinary Bézier curvex(t;b(a¯))(thick line)Note thatC(b(a¯))is a computational device behind the scenes and is not displayed in practice.Figs. 3(A), (B) show that the generalized Bézier curves can be stiffer than ordinary Bézier curves, whereas (C) shows a very responsive almost interpolating generalized Bézier curve.Figs. 3(D), (E), (F) show generalized Bézier curves that are attracted or repelled by different parts of the control polygon.Fig. 4shows two well possible but odd variants of generalized Bézier curves: The first is an example that generalized Bézier curves need not be variation diminishing and the second is an example for the curve flipping over when a zero ofρnis passed.As expected in each case the generalized Bézier curve mimics closely thea¯-transformed control polygon, since the generalized Bézier curve is the Bézier curve for thea¯-transformed control polygon.Since the entries ofM(a¯)are calculated as a convolution of theπn,k's that are binomially weighted sums of thepn,k∈R[a¯]=R[a¯1,…,a¯n], we collect first some properties of the Bell polynomialspn,kand the derivedπn,k, before proceeding to the matrix entriesmn,k.For the convenience of the reader we show a table of thepn,kforn,k=0,…,51000000a¯100000a¯2a¯120000a¯33a¯2a¯1a¯13000a¯44a¯3a¯1+3a¯226a¯2a¯12a¯1400a¯55a¯4a¯1+10a¯3a¯210a¯12a¯3+15a¯22a¯110a¯2a¯13a¯15Obviously by definition (and (1.8)) one haspn,0=δn,0,pn,1=a¯n,pn,n=a¯1n, andpn,n−1=(n+12)a¯1n−1a¯2.The table of theπn,kforn,k=0,…,4is100000a¯10000a¯2ρ2000a¯32a¯3+3a¯2a¯1ρ300a¯43a¯4+4a¯3a¯1+3a¯223a¯4+8a¯3a¯1+6a¯22+6a¯2a¯12ρ4whereρ0=1,ρ1=a¯1,ρ2=a¯2+a¯12,ρ3=a¯3+3a¯2a¯1+a¯13andρ4=a¯4+4a¯3a¯1+3a¯22+6a¯2a¯12+a¯14.By the definition (4.21) ofπn,k, andρn=pn(1)=∑k=1npn,kone seesπn,0=pn,0=δn,0,πn,1=pn,1=a¯nandπn,n=ρn.We are now prepared for a closer examination of the properties of the matrixM(a¯).Theorem 5.1For a feasible sequence of parametersa¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)thea¯-transformation matrixM(a¯)is point-symmetric that means(5.1)mk,l(a¯)=mn−k,n−l(a¯)fork,l=0,…,n.Replacing k byn−kand l byn−lin (4.19) (and j by i) gives (4.20) which equals (4.19).Alternatively, recall thatmk,l(a¯)is the coefficient ofBln(t)inBkn(t;a¯), hencemn−k,n−l(a¯)is the coefficient ofBn−ln(t)inBn−kn(t;a¯). Now the symmetry (4.4) of generalized Bernstein polynomials implies the point-symmetry ofM(a¯).  □Directly from the definitions and the previous special results forπn,kandpn,kone computes(5.2)mk,0(a¯)=δk,0(5.3)ρnm0,l(a¯)=1(nl)πn,n−lforl>0(5.4)ρnmk,1(a¯)=(nk)na¯kρn−kfork>0Forn=2and 3 the matrixρnM(a¯)is[a¯2+a¯121/2a¯200a¯12001/2a¯2a¯2+a¯12][a¯3+3a¯2a¯1+a¯132/3a¯3+a¯2a¯11/3a¯300a¯2a¯1+a¯13a¯2a¯100a¯2a¯1a¯2a¯1+a¯13001/3a¯32/3a¯3+a¯2a¯1a¯3+3a¯2a¯1+a¯13]and forn=4(only columns 1 and 2 for reasons of space)[3/4a¯4+2a¯3a¯1+3/2a¯22+3/2a¯2a¯121/2a¯4+2/3a¯3a¯1+1/2a¯22a¯3a¯1+3a¯2a¯12+a¯144/3a¯3a¯1+2a¯2a¯123/2a¯22+3/2a¯2a¯122a¯22+2a¯2a¯12+a¯14a¯3a¯14/3a¯3a¯1+2a¯2a¯121/4a¯41/2a¯4+2/3a¯3a¯1+1/2a¯22]A further elementary property of the matrixM(a¯)is the followingTheorem 5.2For every feasiblea¯the sum of entries of any column ofM(a¯)is 1:(5.5)∑k=0nmk,l(a¯)=1forl=0,…,n.The partition of unity property∑k=0nBkn(t;a¯)=1implies∑k=0ndk,j(a¯)=δ0,j,sincedk,j(a¯)is the coefficient oftjinBkn(t;a¯)according to (4.2), (4.3). Then∑k=0nmk,l(a¯)=(2.9)∑k=0n∑j=0ndk,j(a¯)tj,l=∑j=0ntj,l∑k=0ndk,j(a¯)=∑j=0ntj,lδ0,j=t0,l=(2.7)1.□A more in depth investigation of the combinatorial properties of the coefficients, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrixM(a¯)will be the subject of a different paper.Next we address a point that facilitates greatly the computation of the matricesM(a¯). Namely that of equivalence classes of parameter sequencesa¯which have identical generalized Bernstein polynomials.Definition 5.3Two feasible parameter sequencesa¯anda¯′of the same length n are called equivalent,a¯∼a¯′, if and only ifBkn(t;a¯)=Bkn(t;a¯′)fork=0,…,n.A parameter sequencea¯=(1,a¯2,…,a¯n)is called normalized.The following theorem yields a practical way to describe and represent the equivalence classes of parameter sequences.Theorem 5.4Leta¯be a feasible parameter sequence. Then(5.6)a¯=(a¯1,…,a¯n)∼a¯′=(1,a¯2a¯1,…,a¯na¯1n)(5.7)a¯=(1,a¯2,…,a¯n)∼a¯′=(1,a¯2′,…,a¯n′)⟹a¯k=a¯k′fork=2,…,n.In words: For every feasible parameter sequence there exists an equivalent normalized parameter sequence, and two equivalent normalized feasible parameter sequences are identical.ProofFor (5.6) one computespn,k(a¯′)=(1.7)1k!∑i1+⋯+ik=ni1,…,ik>0(ni1,…,ik)a¯i1′⋯a¯ik′=1k!∑i1+⋯+ik=ni1,…,ik>0(ni1,…,ik)1a¯1na¯i1⋯a¯ik=1a¯1npn,k(a¯)pn(t;a¯′)=(1.6)∑k=1npn,k(a¯′)tk=1a¯1npn(t;a¯)ρn(a¯′)=∑k=1npn,k(a¯′)=1a¯1n∑k=1npn,k(a¯)=1a¯1nρn(a¯)which impliesBkn(t;a¯)=Bkn(t;a¯′)fork=0,…,nby the definition (1.3) of generalized Bernstein polynomials.For the proof of (5.7) we assume thata¯1=1. Clearly,Bkn(t;a¯)=Bkn(t;a¯′)fork=0,…,niff the generalized Bernstein polynomials have the same coefficients. Since the coefficients are polynomials inZ[a¯2,…,a¯n]it is possible in principle that different normalized parameter sequences yield the same coefficients. To demonstrate that this is not the case assume first thatρn(a¯)=ρn(a¯′).From (1.7) one concludes thatpn,n(a¯)=a¯1n=1and fork<n:pn,k(a¯)=1(k−1)!n!1!…1!(n−(k−1)!)a¯1…a¯1a¯n−(k−1)+qkn=(nk−1)a¯n−k+1+qknwithqkn∈Z[a¯2,…,a¯n−k].Thenρn(a¯)Bn,k(t;a¯)=p0(t;a¯)pn(1−t;a¯)=pn(1−t;a¯)=∑k=1npn,k(a¯)(1−t)k=∑k=1n[(−1)kpn,k(a¯)tk+pn,k(a¯)qk(t)]withdegqk<k.Therefore the coefficient oftkinρnBn,k(t;a¯)is(−1)kpn,k(a¯)+q¯kwithq¯k∈Z[pn,k+1(a¯),…,pn,n(a¯)]=(−1)k(nk−1)a¯n−k+1+q¯¯kwithq¯¯k∈Z[a¯2,…,a¯n−k].If nowk0is the smallest k such thata¯k≠a¯k′, then the coefficients oftn−k0+1inρn(a¯)Bn,k(t;a¯)andρn(a¯′)Bn,k(t;a¯′)are different.Ifρn(a¯)≠ρn(a¯′), then the coefficients oftninBn,k(t;a¯)andBn,k(t;a¯′)are different.  □We close with results about endpoint tangentiality of generalized Bézier curves.Theorem 5.5The generalized Bernstein polynomialsBn,k(t;a¯)of degree n possess endpoint tangentiality iff the parameter sequencea¯satisfies(5.8)a¯kρn−k′fork=2,…,n,whereρn−k′results fromρn−kby settinga¯1=1. For everyn⩾4there exists such a parameter sequence different froma¯=(1,0,…,0).By symmetry we need to investigate endpoint tangentiality only att=0which means that the vector of control pointsb1−b0(≠ null vector) and the vector ofa¯-transformed control pointsb(a¯)1−b(a¯)0are linearly dependent. In other words∃α∈R∖{0}:b(a¯)1−b(a¯)0=α(b1−b0).Nowb(a¯)1−b(a¯)0=(4.13)∑k=0nbk(mk,l(a¯)−mk,0(a¯))=(5.2)b0(mk,l−1)+∑k=1nbkmk,l(a¯).Independence from the choice of thebkimplies firstmk,l(a¯)=0fork=2,…,nwhich by (5.4) anda¯1=1is (5.8) and secondm1,1(a¯)b1−(1−m0,1(a¯))b0=α(b1−b0)orm1,l(a¯)=1−m0,l. Since the latter is already implied by (5.3), we do not have any further restriction on the parameters beyond (5.8).Note thatρ0′=ρ1′=1impliesa¯n=a¯n−1=0.We finish the proof by showing that the alternating factorial parameter sequencea¯=(1,−1,2,−6,…,(−1)n(n−3)!,0,0)satisfies (5.8) for everyn⩾4. The infinite parameter sequencea¯=(1,−1,2,−6,…,(−1)n(n−1)!,…)is associated tof¯(t)=ln(1+t)according to (1.9). Therefore the sequence of associated polynomials vanishes forn⩾2atx=1according to (1.10). But then by definitionρn−k′=0fork=2,…,n−2in (5.8) and fork=n−1and n we noted alreadya¯n=a¯n−1=0.  □Forn⩽3Eqs. (5.8) do not have non-trivial solutions (different from the Bernstein casea¯=(1,0,…,0)), but forn=4we geta¯=(1,−1,0,0)(see Figs. 5(A), (B)) and forn=5the two sequencesa¯=(1,−1,2,0,0)(see Figs. 5(C), (D)) anda¯=(1,−1/3,0,0,0)(see Figs. 5(E), (F)).Forn=6the following non-trivial parameter sequences exist:(1)(1,−1+6/3,0,0,0,0)see Figs. 5(I), (J)(1,−1−6/3,0,0,0,0)see Figs. 5(K), (L)(1,1−2,−3(1−2)−1,0,0,0)(1,1+2,−3(1+2)−1,0,0,0)(1,0,−1,0,0,0)(1,−1,0,2,0,0)(1,−1,2,−6,0,0)see Figs. 5(G), (H)(1,−1/3−10/15,0,0,0,0,0)(1,−1/3+10/15,0,0,0,0,0)(1,−0.2454621693,0.07300449660,0,0,0,0)(approximate numbers)(1,0,−1/4,0,0,0,0)(1,−1/5,−1+3/5,12/5−6/5,0,0,0)(1,1/5,−1−3/5,12/5+6/5,0,0,0)(1,0,−1,3,0,0,0)(1,−1/3,0,2/15,0,0,0)(1,−1,0,0,−6,0,0)(1,−1,1/2,0,−6,0,0)(1,−1,2,−6,24,0,0)see Fig. 5(M)Note how the generalized Bézier curves of the alternating factorial parameter sequence develop for growing n: Figs. 5(D), (H), (M), (N), (O), (P) forn=5,…,10.Direct proof (conceptually simple but tedious):ProofEssentially one drills down fromskn(t)to monomials in t back to Bernstein polynomials.skn(t)=(nk)pk(t)qn−k(1−t)=(nk)[∑ν=0kpk,νtν]⋅[∑μ=0n−kqn−k,μ(1−t)μ]=(2.5)(nk)[∑ν=0kpk,ν(∑j=νktν,j[k]Bjk(t))]⋅[∑μ=0n−kqn−k,μ(∑i=μn−ktμ,i[n−k]Bin−k(1−t))]=(2.4)(nk)∑ν=0k∑μ=0n−kpk,νqn−k,μ(∑j=νktν,j[k]Bjk(t))⋅(∑i=μn−ktμ,i[n−k]Bn−k−in−k(t))=(nk)∑ν=0k∑μ=0n−kpk,νqn−k,μ(∑j=νk∑i=μn−ktν,j[k]tμ,i[n−k]Bjk(t)Bn−k−in−k(t))From the definition (1.2) of Bernstein polynomials one calculatestν,j[k]tμ,i[n−k]Bjk(t)Bn−k−in−k(t)=(2.7)(jν)(kν)⋅(iμ)(n−kμ)⋅(kj)(n−kn−k−i)⋅tn−(k+i−j)(1−t)k+i−j=(k−νj−ν)(n−k−μi−μ)⋅tn−(k+i−j)(1−t)k+i−j=(2.4)(k−νk−j)(n−k−μn−k−i)1(nn−(k+i−j))Bn−(k+i−j)n(t)and concludes withl:=n−(k+i−j)skn(t)=(nk)(nl)∑ν=0k∑μ=1n−kpk,νqn−k,μ∑j=νk∑i=μn−k(k−νk−j)(n−k−μn−k−i)Bln(t)=(nk)(nl)∑ν=0k∑j=νk(k−νk−j)pk,ν∑μ=0n−k∑i=μn−k(n−k−μn−k−i)qn−k,μBln(t)=(nk)(nl)∑j=0k∑ν=0j(k−νk−j)pk,ν∑i=0n−k∑μ=0i(n−k−μn−k−i)qn−k,μBln(t)Using the abbreviations (2.18) one computesskn(t)=(nk)(nl)∑j=0k∑i=0n−kπk,jπn−k,i′Bln(t)Since n, k, l are fixed andl:=n−(k+i−j)either the choice of i determines j and the sum over j collapses or the choice of j determines i and the sum over i collapses. This gives (4.16)–(4.17).  □Second proof with blossoming (Ramshaw, 1989; Seidel, 1989):ProofFor a polynomialp(t)of degree n the blossomfp(u1,…,un)can be generated by replacing the monomialstνofp(t)by the polynomialseν(u1,…,un)/(nν)whereeνis the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree ν in the n variablesu1,…,un. Clearly,fpis then the unique multi-affine, symmetric polynomial that coincides with p on the diagonal:fp(t,…,t)=p(t).It is well-known (Ramshaw, 1989; Seidel, 1989; Farin, 2001) that the n control points of the Bézier curvep([0,1])are given byfp(0(n−r),1(r))forr=0,…,nwhere the arguments offpconsist ofn−rzeros and r ones. With1(nν)eν(0(n−r),1(r))=(rν)(nν)=(n−νn−r)(nr)one computes with the abbreviation (4.18)fp(0(n−r),1(r))=∑ν=0npn,ν1(nν)eν(0(n−r),1(r))=∑ν=0npn,ν(n−νn−r)(nr)=1(nr)∑ν=0n(n−νn−r)pn,ν=1(nr)πn,r=:ξn,r.Similarlyfq(0(n−r),1(r))=1(nr)πn,r′=:ξn,r′.For the computation of the blossom and the control points ofskn(t)we need some more notations. Set[n]:={1,…,n}andC(n,k):={I|I⊂[n],|I|=k}.ForU:={u1,…,un}andI={i1,…,ik}∈C(n,k)setUI:={ui1,…,uik}and1−UI:={1−ui1,…,1−uik}. Then the blossom ofskn(t)is(A.1)fskn(u1,…,un)=∑I∈C(n,k)fpk(UI)fqn−k(1−U[n]∖I).Note that the l-th control point ofskn(t)isfskn(0(n−l),1(l))=mk,l.To compute this expression let j be an integer such thatfpk(0(k−j),1(j))=ξk,jmakes a non-vanishing contribution tofskn(0(n−l),1(l))in (5.1). In other words, we choose j ones from the l available ones as arguments forfpkand take the remainingl−jones forfqn−k(0(l−j),1(n−k−(l−j)))=ξn−k,n−k−l+j′.We also choosek−jzeros from then−lavailable zeros forfpk(0(k−j),1(j))so for fixed j we get an all in all contribution tomk,lof(n−lk−j)(lj)ξk,jξn−k,n−k−l+j′=(n−lk−j)(lj)(kj)(n−kn−k−l+j)πk,jπn−k,n−k−l+j′=(nk)(nl)πk,jπn−k,n−k−l+j′where surprisingly the binomial coefficients are independent of j.Summing up forj=0,…,lgives the result.  □
