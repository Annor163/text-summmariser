@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We introduce a new family of coalitional values designed to take into account players’ attitudes with regard to cooperation. This new family of values applies to cooperative games with a coalition structure by combining the Shapley value and the multinomial probabilistic values, thus generalizing the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues. Besides an axiomatic characterization, a computational procedure is provided in terms of the multilinear extension of the game and an application to the Catalonia Parliament, Legislature 2003–2007, is shown.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Value theory started by Shapley (1953), who introduced the axiomatic method in cooperative game theory to define a solution concept called now the Shapley value. The Shapley value is characterized as the unique value to satisfy efficiency, the null player property, symmetry, and additivity.Weber (1988) obtained a wide generalization of the Shapley value by defining the family of probabilistic values, each one of which requires weighting coefficientspSifor each player i and each coalition S⊆N\{i}. The payoff that a probabilistic value allocates to each player is a weighted sum of his marginal contributions in the game. We quote from Weber (1988):“Let player i view his participation in a game v as consisting merely of joining some coalition S and then receiving as a reward his marginal contribution to the coalition. IfpSiis the probability that he joins coalition S, then ϕi[v] is his expected payoff from the game.”Puente (2000) (see also Freixas and Puente, 2002) defined two special subfamilies of probabilistic values: (a) binomial semivalues, where the weighting coefficients depend on a unique parameter q ∈ [0, 1]; and (b) multinomial probabilistic values, where the weighting coefficients depend on n parameters, one per player and all in [0, 1] too.11Incidentally, we point out that the “Banzhaf α-indices”, introduced by Carreras (2004) when generalizing the decisiveness notion studied in Carreras (2005), are multinomial probabilistic values applied to simple games—i.e., used as power indices. Cf. Carreras and Puente (2013) or Carreras and Puente (2014a) for a joint work on these values and Giménez, Llongueras, and Puente (2014) for their application to the study of the partnership formation, which generalizes Carreras, Llongueras, and Puente (2009) widely.Of course, (a) is a subfamily of (b).Introduced by Aumann and Drèze (1974), the notion of game with a coalition structure provided a new avenue for the development of value theory. Since then, a lot of work has been done in this new field, mainly addressed to define coalitional values that often represent extensions of classical values to this setup. The best known coalitional value is the Owen value, an extension of the Shapley value introduced by Owen (1977)(see also Owen, 2013). The Owen value is characterized uniquely by the following axioms: efficiency, the null player property, symmetry within unions, symmetry in the quotient game, and additivity.Carreras and Puente (2006) (see also Carreras and Puente, 2011) extended the binomial semivalues to games with a coalition structure: they used these values in the quotient game and the Shapley value within unions and obtained the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues, a family depending on one parameter q ∈ [0, 1] that includes (when q = 1/2) the symmetric coalitional Banzhaf value introduced by Alonso and Fiestras (2002). The only axiomatic difference between these new coalitional values and the Owen value is that the former satisfy the total power property whereas the latter satisfies efficiency.In the present paper we extend the multinomial probabilistic values to games with a coalition structure by introducing the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values, a family that includes all symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues.A first main aspect of the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values is that each one of them depends on n parameters (n being the number of players), which are interpreted as the individual tendencies of the players to form coalitions. A second main aspect is that they apply a multinomial probabilistic value in the quotient game that arises once the coalition structure is actually formed, but share within each union the payoff so obtained by applying the Shapley value to a game that concerns only the players of that union.Using the Shapley value looks highly interesting in voting contexts. Indeed, once an alliance is formed—and, especially, if it supports a coalition government,—cabinet ministries, parliamentary and institutional positions, budget management, and other political responsibilities should be distributed among the members of the alliance efficiently, so the Shapley value is useful here. We thus evaluate not only the parliamentary power of the alliance but also the way to share this power allocation among its members. This two-step procedure (first power, then cake) offers a balanced approach for dealing with coalitional bargaining.We emphasize the role of these new values as a consistent alternative to classical coalitional values. The fact that they are based on tendency profiles provides new tools to encompass a wide variety of situations that derive from players’ personalities when playing a game. In this sense, the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values constitute a significant generalization of the symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues, whose monoparametric condition implies a limited capability to analyze such situations. Of course, these situations cannot be analyzed, without modifying the game, by means of classical, nonparametric values, which can be concerned only with the (formal) structure of the game.Finally, it is worth mentioning that the greater ability of the new values to deal with strategic features is achieved without losing standard properties satisfied by classical coalitional values, e.g. linearity, positivity, the total power property, the dummy player property, symmetry within unions, or the quotient game property.The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, a minimum of preliminaries is provided. Section 3 is devoted to define and to study the family of coalitional multinomial probabilistic values, including an axiomatic characterization. In Section 4 we restrict such values to simple games. Section 5 presents a computation procedure for these values by means of multilinear extensions. Section 6 contains an application of the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values to the analysis of the Catalonia Parliament (Legislature 2003–2007). Section 7 includes concluding remarks. All proofs are collected in Appendix A.We assume that the reader is generally familiar with the basic ideas of the cooperative game theory (including simple games, which will be briefly revised in Section 4).Let N be a finite set of players, usually denoted as N = {1, 2, …, n}, and 2Nbe the set of coalitions (subsets of N). A (cooperative) game in N is a functionv:2N→Rthat assigns a real number v(S) to each coalition S⊆N, with v(∅) = 0. A game v is monotonic if v(S) ≤ v(T) whenever S⊂T⊆N. Player i ∈ N is a dummy in v if v(S∪{i}) = v(S) + v({i}) for all S⊆N\{i}, and null in v if, moreover, v({i}) = 0. Two players i, j ∈ N are symmetric in v if v(S∪{i}) = v(S∪{j}) for all S⊆N\{i, j}.Endowed with the natural operations for real-valued functions, i.e. v + v′ and λv for allλ∈R,the setGNof all games in N becomes a vector space. For every nonempty coalition T⊆N, the unanimity gameuTin N is defined by uT(S) = 1 if T⊆S and uT(S) = 0 otherwise, and it is easily checked that the set of all unanimity games is a basis forGN.By a value onGNwe will mean a mapf:GN→RN,that assigns to every game v a vector f[v] with components fi[v] for all i ∈ N.The multilinear extensionOwen (1972) of a gamev∈GNis the real-valued function defined onRNby22The term “multilinear” means that, for each i ∈ N, the function is linear in xi, that is, of the formf(x1,x2,⋯,xn)=gi(x1,x2,⋯,xi∧,⋯,xn)xi+hi(x1,x2,⋯,xi∧,⋯,xn).(1)f(x1,x2,⋯,xn)=∑S⊆N[∏i∈Sxi∏j∈N∖S(1−xj)]v(S).The multinomial probabilistic values form a subfamily of probabilistic valuesWeber (1988). They were introduced in reliability by Puente (2000) (see also Freixas and Puente, 2002) as follows. Let N = {1, 2, …, n} and let p ∈ [0, 1]n, that is, p = (p1, p2, …, pn) with 0 ≤ pi≤ 1 for i = 1, 2, …, n, be given. Then the coefficients(2)pSi=∏j∈Spj∏k∈N∖Sk≠i(1−pk)foralli∈NandS⊆N∖{i}(where the empty product, arising if S = ∅ or S = N\{i}, is taken to be 1) define a probabilistic value onGNthat is called the p-multinomial probabilistic value and will be denoted here as λp. Its action is then given by(3)λip[v]=∑S⊆N∖{i}[∏j∈Spj∏k∈N∖Sk≠i(1−pk)][v(S∪{i})−v(S)]foralli∈Nandv∈GN.In particular, the action of λpon a unanimity game uTis given by(4)λip[uT]=∏j∈Tj≠ipjifi∈Tandλip[uT]=0otherwise.As was announced in Section 1, we will attach to each pithe meaning of tendency of player i to form coalitions, and thus we will say that p is a (tendency) profile in N. The components of p will be assumed to be independent of each other. From Eq. (2) it follows that coefficientpSi,the probability of i to join S according to Weber (1988), is an increasing function of the tendency of each member of S to form coalitions and a decreasing function of the tendency in this sense of each outside player, i.e. each member of N\(S∪{i}).Given N = {1, 2, …, n}, we will denote by B(N) the set of all partitions of N. Each B ∈ B(N) is called a coalition structure in N, and each member of B is called a union. The so-called trivial coalition structures are Bn= {{1}, {2}, …, {n}} (individual coalitions) and BN= {N} (grand coalition). A (cooperative) game with a coalition structure is a pair [v; B], wherev∈GNand B ∈ B(N) for a given N. Each partition B gives a pattern of cooperation among players. We denote byGNcs=GN×B(N)the set of all games with a coalition structure and player set N.If[v;B]∈GNcsand B = {B1, B2, …, Bm}, the quotient game vBis the game played by the unions or, rather, by the quotient set M = {1, 2, …, m} of their representatives, as follows:vB(R)=v(⋃r∈RBr)forallR⊆M.By a coalitional value onGNcswe will mean a mapg:GNcs→RN,which assigns to every pair [v; B] a vector g[v; B] with components gi[v; B] for each i ∈ N.If f is a value onGNand g is a coalitional value onGNcs,it is said that g is a coalitional value of f (or a coalitional f-value, for short) iff g[v; Bn] = f[v] for allv∈GN.We introduce here a new family of coalitional values, establish their main common properties and discuss some aspects.When trying to extend multinomial probabilistic values to games with a coalition structure, a first question refers to the way by which, given a coalition structure B = {B1, B2, …, Bm} and a tendency profilep=(p1,p2,⋯,pn)in N, a tendency profilep¯=(p¯1,p¯2,⋯,p¯m)is defined in the quotient set M. Only two natural constraints will be imposed.Definition 3.1Given profile p and coalition structure B in N, profilep¯is a profile induced bypin M iff: (i) eachp¯rdepends only on those pisuch that i ∈ Br; and (ii) if, for a given Br∈ B, there is some q ∈ [0, 1] such that pi= q for all i ∈ Brthenp¯r=q.33Condition (ii) guarantees consistency with symmetric coalitional binomial semivalues (cf. Alonso, Carreras, and Puente, 2007; Carreras and Puente, 2006; 2011).Of course, the interpretation attached to p1, p2, …, pnin Subsection 2.2 will be kept in passing top¯1,p¯2,…,p¯m. Among the infinitely many possibilities to define an induced profilep¯=(p¯1,p¯2,…,p¯m)in terms of p, let us suggest a few ones only as a matter of example:(α)p¯r=mini∈Br{pi}p¯r=pifor some i ∈ Brarbitrarily chosenp¯r=1br∑i∈Brpi,where br= |Br|p¯r=maxi∈Br{pi}We will not try to discuss here which is the best option (if it exists). It may happen that different situations require different ways to definep¯1,p¯2,…,p¯m. Even more, nothing prevents different unions to make different choices when defining their respective tendencies in the quotient game—this is the reason for having imposed conditions (i) and (ii) for each union. Fortunately, the great freedom in this choice will not affect the validity of the theoretical results: the theory developed in this paper will be of application provided thatp¯is a profile induced by p, no matter by which mechanism.44Although the results obtained in practice will depend in general of this mechanism (cf. Example 3.4).However, in order to avoid using a more cumbersome notation and any ambiguity, we will implicitly assume from now on in the theoretical development that, for any given N, a unique mechanism has been chosen to induce, given p and B in N, a profilep¯in M.Definition 3.2Let N = {1, 2, …, n} be a finite player set and p = (p1, p2, …, pn) be a profile in N. The coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value is the coalitional valueΛp:GNcs→RNdefined as follows. If[v;B]∈GNcsand i ∈ Bk∈ B,(5)Λip[v;B]=∑R⊆M∖{k}[∏j∈Rp¯j∏h∈M∖Rh≠k(1−p¯h)]×∑T⊆Bk∖{i}v(Q∪T∪{i})−v(Q∪T)bk(bk−1t),wherep¯is the profile induced bypin M,Q=⋃r∈RBr,bk= |Bk|, and t = |T|.The coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value Λpyields the result of a two-step bargaining procedure analogous to that used in Owen (1977); 1982) and also in Alonso and Fiestras (2002), Carreras and Puente (2006); 2011), Alonso et al. (2007). Here we first apply thep¯-multinomial probabilistic valueλp¯in the quotient game to obtain a payoff for each union; next, we use within each union the Shapley value, denoted here by φ, to share the payoff efficiently by applying this value to a reduced game played in that union.55The reduced game is as follows. First, if S⊆Bk, letv¯SBbe the pseudoquotient game in M defined byv¯SB(R)=v[(⋃r∈RBr)∖(Bk∖S)]foreachR⊆M.This game is the modification of the standard quotient game vBwhen S replaces union Bk, as if the players of Bk\S were temporarily inactive. The reduced game of v in Bk, denoted by wk, is then given bywk(S)=λkp¯[v¯SB]foreachS⊆Bk.The proof is essentially the same as in Owen (1977); 1982), Alonso and Fiestras (2002), Carreras and Puente (2006); 2011), Alonso et al. (2007) and will be omitted. Moreover, the new value coincides with one of these two values when the coalition structure is trivial. Indeed, it is straightforward to check that, for allv∈GNand any profile p in N,(i)Λp[v; BN] = φ[v];Λp[v; Bn] = λp[v], i.e. Λpis a coalitionalλp–value.To illustrate the two-step procedure, we consider a very simple instance: let n = 4 and game v be defined by v(S) = 1 if |S| ≥ 3 and v(S) = 0 otherwise. Let p = (0.4, 0.8, 0.6, 0.2) and B = {{1, 2}, {3}, {4}}. Let M = {1, 3, 4}, where 1 denotes the representative of {1, 2} and the remaining players represent themselves (a nonstandard but easier notation in particular cases like this). The quotient game is given by vB(R) = 1 if R = {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 3, 4} and vB(R) = 0 otherwise.Let us choose e.g. option (γ), according to which eachp¯ris the arithmetic mean of the pi’s for all i ∈ Br, and take therefore as induced profilep¯=(0.6,0.6,0.2). By applying thep¯-multinomial probabilistic valueλp¯to the quotient game, using Eq. (3) we haveλp¯[vB]=(0.68,0.48,0.24).Then, in the case of singletons {3} and {4}, the payoff received by the union in the quotient game is allocated to its unique member. For union {1, 2}, the fact that its players are symmetric in v implies that they share the payoff equally. Thus (see Fig. 1),66Using other mechanisms to definep¯would give different final results: for example, Λp[v; B] = (0.34, 0.34, 0.32, 0.16) for option (α), Λp[v; B] = (0.34, 0.34, 0.64, 0.32) for option (δ), and one or another of these results for option (β), depending on which player’s tendency (1 or 2) is chosen to definep¯1.Λp[v;B]=(0.34,0.34,0.48,0.24).What has happened with the symmetry of all players in the original game? Players 3 and 4 are symmetric also in the coalition structure, and hence in the quotient game, but their final payoffs differ because of their different parameters. Instead, players 1 and 2 earn a common final payoff, in spite of having different parameters, because they are in the same union.The rest of this section is devoted to the discussion of common properties for all coalitional multinomial probabilistic values. Our main aim is to reach an axiomatic characterization for each one of these values. We begin by considering standard properties for a generic coalitional value g onGNcs:•linearity: g[αv + βv′; B] = αg[v; B] + βg[v′; B] for allα,β∈R,v, v′ and Bpositivity: if v is monotonic, then g[v; B] ≥ 0 for all Bdummy player property: if i is a dummy in v, then gi[v; B] = v({i}) for all Bsymmetry within unions: if i, j ∈ Bkare symmetric players in v thengi[v;B]=gj[v;B]symmetry in the quotient game: if r, s ∈ M are symmetric players in game vBthen∑i∈Brgi[v;B]=∑j∈Bsgj[v;B]quotient game property: for all[v;B]∈GNcsand all k ∈ M,(6)∑i∈Bkgi[v;B]=gk[vB;Bm].In principle, this last property makes sense only for coalitional values defined for all N; in such a case, one generally abuses the notation and uses a unique symbol g on bothGNCSandGMCS. However, the property also makes sense for a coalitional value g on a givenGNcsprovided, at least, that it induces a coalitional valueg¯onGMcsfor each B ∈ B(N).And this is precisely the case of the coalitional multinomial probabilistic values. Indeed, let p be a profile and B a coalition structure (both in N), M the quotient set, andp¯the profile in M induced by p. Profilep¯defines a (multinomial probabilistic) valueλp¯onGMand hence a coalitional (multinomial probabilistic) valueΛp¯onGMcssuch that, by Remark 3.3(ii),Λp¯[w;Bm]=λp¯[w]forallw∈GM.Now, two additional nonstandard properties will be considered.Definition 3.6Let p be a profile in N. A coalitional value g onGNCSsatisfies the coalitionalp-multinomial total power property iff, for all[v;B]∈GNcs,∑i∈Ngi[v;B]=∑k∈M∑R⊆M∖{k}[∏j∈Rp¯j∏h∈M∖Rh≠k(1−p¯h)][v(Q∪Bk)−v(Q)],wherep¯is the profile induced by p in M andQ=⋃r∈RBr.Let p be a profile in N. A coalitional value g onGNCSsatisfies the property ofp-weighted payoffs for quotients of unanimity games iff, for any B ∈ B(N) and any nonempty T⊆N,p¯k∑i∈Bkgi[uT;B]=p¯ℓ∑j∈Bℓgj[uT;B]forallBk,Bℓ∈BintersectingT,wherep¯is the profile induced by p in M.Our axiomatic characterization theorem essentially holds for any coalitional p-multibinary probabilistic value with a positive profile p = (p1, p2, …, pn).77This is revisited in the proof of Theorem 3.9.“Positive” merely means that pi> 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n. To ease the proof of this theorem it is convenient to state a preliminary result, which holds for any profile.Proposition 3.8Let p be a profile in N. The coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value satisfies positivity and the quotient game property.Let p be a positive profile in a given player set N. Then there is a unique coalitional value onGNcsthat satisfies linearity, the dummy player property, symmetry within unions, the coalitional p-multinomial total power property, and the property of p-weighted payoffs for quotients of unanimity games. It is the coalitional p-multinomial probabilistic value.Theorem 3.9, where linearity could be replaced with additivity, generalizes Theorem 1 in Alonso and Fiestras (2002) and Theorem 3.5 in Carreras and Puente (2006) (i.e., Theorem 3.6 in Carreras and Puente, 2011). We have checked the logical independence of the axiomatic system for Theorem 3.9 in Carreras and Puente (2014b).
