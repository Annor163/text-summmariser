@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we present a financial economy in the case when the financial volumes depend on time and on the expected solution, in order to take into account the influence of the expected equilibrium distribution for assets and liabilities on the investments on all financial instruments. We derive the quasi-variational formulation which characterizes the equilibrium of the dynamical financial model. The main result of the paper is a general existence theorem for quasi-variational inequalities under general assumptions, which is also applied to the financial model. We also recall some concepts on the infinite dimensional duality and study some numerical examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nagurney, Dong, and Hughes (1992) were the first to develop a multi-sector, multi-instrument financial equilibrium problem using the theory of variational inequalities and recognized the network structure underlying the problem. That contribution was subsequently extended by Nagurney (1994) to include more general utility functions and by Nagurney and Siokos (1997a, 1997b) who formulated a dynamic financial equilibrium model and analyzed it qualitatively using the theory of projected dynamical systems (see also Cojocaru, Daniele, & Nagurney, 2006). Many other dynamic financial models, along with their variational inequality formulations at the equilibrium state, can be found in the book by Nagurney and Siokos (1997a).We notice that Daniele (2006) proposed an alternative approach to the one noted above, indeed the dynamics are now modeled not using the theory of projected dynamical systems (Nagurney & Zhang, 1996), but studied by means of evolutionary variational inequalities and these are infinite – rather than finite-dimensional. In addition, the variance-covariance matrices (see also Markowitz, 1952, 1959) which allow us for risk minimization are now time-varying as well as the financial volumes held by sectors.We recall that in the previous papers (see Barbagallo, Daniele, Giuffré, & Maugeri, 2014; Barbagallo, Daniele, Lorino, Maugeri, & Mirabella, 2013a; Barbagallo et al., 2014; Barbagallo, Daniele, & Maugeri, 2012; Daniele, 2005; Daniele et al., 2014; Daniele, Giuffrè, & Pia, 2005a) the authors consider a general equilibrium model of financial flows and prices where the measure of the financial risk is of a Markowitz type. Unlike previous papers, in this paper we consider as a measure of the financial risk a general function.Infinite-dimensional variational inequalities have been used previously in finance by Jaillet, Lamberton, and Lapeyre (1990) for the pricing of American options, and by Tourin and Zariphopoulou (1994) for single-agent investment modeling and computation. Stochastic variational inequalities, in turn, have been used by McLean (1993) for the non-linear portfolio choice problem and by Gurkan, Ozge, and Robinson (1996) for the pricing of American options. For additional background on financial problems and variational inequalities see Nagurney (2001).The papers by Daniele and Maugeri (2001) and Daniele, Maugeri, and Oettli (1998), Daniele, Maugeri, and Oettli (1999) discuss other time-dependent applications using the approach revealed in Daniele (2006) for the first time for financial equilibrium problems.The quasi-variational inequality problem was introduced by Bensoussan, Goursat, and Lions (1973) in the context of impulse control problems. Such problems were studied by many authors (Baiocchi & Capelo, 1984; Chan & Pang, 1982; Mosco, 1976).Many applications of these mathematical tools are known, for instance, we may refer to Bensoussan (1974) and Harker and Pang (1990), who recognized the connection between generalized Nash games and quasi-variational inequalities;Pang and Fukushima (2005) applied this result in order to formulate the noncooperative multi-leader-follower game in terms of generalized Nash games, Bliemer and Bovy (2003) discussed a quasi-variational inequality formulation of the dynamic traffic assignment problem. Applications to some economic and financial models can be found in Scrimali (2008) and (Scrimali, 2009).Quasi-variational inequalities appear also in well known equilibrium problems in networks, such as the traffic equilibrium problem. In this case, when we consider the conservation law in elastic or adaptive form, we are lead to the following quasi-variational inequality:FindH∈K(H):C(H)(F−H)≥0∀F∈K(H),where H is the equilibrium path flow,K(H)is the feasible set, C(H) is the path cost function.Quasi-variational inequality formulations derive also from generalized dual problems and saddle point problems (see Toyasaki, Daniele, and Wakolbinger, 2014 and Yao, 1991), from equilibrium problems involving abstract economies (see Yao, 1991), from applications to engineering (see Kocvara & Outrata, 1995), from spatial oligopolistic electricity models with Cournot generators and regulated transmission prices (see Wei & Smeers, 1999), from dynamic oligopolistic market equilibrium problems (see Barbagallo & Mauro, 2013), from competitive economic equilibrium problems with utility functions (see Donato, Milasi, and Vitanza, 2008 and Vitanza, Donato, and Milasi, 2009), from time-dependent traffic equilibrium models (see Scrimali, 2004), from pollution control quasi-equilibrium problems with joint implementation of environmental projects (see Scrimali, 2012), etc.For all these problems our main result allows us to weaken the monotonicity assumptions on the operator. Furthermore, our existence result has been fundamental for ensuring the existence of the financial equilibrium in the case of Markowitz type utility functions (see Daniele, Lorino, & Mirabella, 2005b).In this paper we study the financial model evolving in time and the equilibrium conditions are considered in dynamic sense. Moreover the amount of investment as liabilities and as assets is assumed depending on the expected solutions, namely we require that the set of feasible solutions is flexible and adaptive and this objective is achieved just assuming that the equality constraints depend on the variational solution. This leads to a quasi-variational formulation.The aim of this paper is to prove an existence theorem for quasi-variational inequalities under general and reasonable assumptions, namely assumptions really satisfied in concrete situations. Indeed we shall prove a general existence theorem (see Theorem 2.2) which, roughly speaking, under some kind of monotonicity and the Fan-hemicontinuity of the operator, along with natural growth conditions, ensures the existence of solutions for a general variational inequality.The paper is also enriched by the study of numerical examples on financial networks with adaptive constraint sets.The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the financial model, introduce the needed assumptions and state the general theorem (see Theorem 2.2) which will be proved in Section 3 as well as Theorem 2.3 which ensures the existence of the solution to the variational inequality associated with the financial network. In Section 4 we recall some concepts and theorems related to the infinite dimensional duality for the general financial equilibrium problem and introduce the notion of evaluation index. In Section 5 we present some concrete examples of financial networks whose variational inequalities are solved by using the direct method (see Maugeri, 1987) and, studying the evaluation index, we realize when the economy is in a regression phase. Finally, Section 6 is dedicated to the conclusions.We consider a financial economy consisting of m sectors (such as domestic businesses, banks, and other financial institutions), with a typical sector denoted by i, and of n instruments (such as mortgages, mutual funds, savings deposits, money market funds), with a typical financial instrument denoted by j, in the horizon [0, T]. Let si(t) denote the total financial volume held by sector i at time t as assets, and let li(t) denote the total financial volume held by sector i at time t as liabilities and assume they depend on time in order to describe the unstable behavior of the economy. We denote, at time t, the amount of instrument j held as an asset in sector i’s portfolio by xij(t) and the amount of instrument j held as a liability in sector i’s portfolio by yij(t). The assets in sector i’s portfolio are grouped into the column vectorxi(t)=[xi1(t),xi2(t),…,xij(t),…,xin(t)]Tand the liabilities in sector i’s portfolio are grouped into the column vectoryi(t)=[yi1(t),yi2(t),…,yij(t),…,yin(t)]T. Moreover, group the sector asset vectors into the matrixx(t)∈L2([0,T],Rnm)and the sector liability vectors into the matrixy(t)∈L2([0,T],Rnm).We denote the price of instrument j held as an asset at time t by rj(t) and the price of instrument j held as liability at time t by(1+hj(t))rj(t),where h is a nonnegative function defined into [0, T] and belonging L∞([0, T]). We introduce the term hj(t) because the prices of liabilities are generally greater than or equal to the prices of assets so that we can describe in a more consistent fashion the behavior of the markets for which the liabilities are more expensive than the assets. Under the assumption of perfect competition, each sector will behave as if it has no influence on the instrument prices or on the behavior of the other sectors, but the equilibrium prices depend on the total amount of investments and liabilities of each sector. The total financial volumes siand lidepend on time t and on the expected solution, namely by∫0Tw*(s)ds,so siis given bysi(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)and liis given byli(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds). In such a way we are taking into account the influence, by means of the average value, of the expected equilibrium distribution for assets and liabilities on the investments on all financial instruments. In the literature this kind of constraints is called elastic or adaptive constraints. In order to make the model more consistent with reality, we introduce the government intervention through a taxation on the profits, so we denote the given tax rate levied on sector i’s net revenue on financial instrument j by τij, with τij∈ [0, 1) a.e.We adhere to the existing formulation of the financial model determining for each sector i the optimal composition of instruments held as assets and as liabilities, namely also in our paper we consider the following utility function:Ui(t,xi(t),yi(t),r(t))=ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))+∑j=1nrj(t)(1−τij(t))[xij(t)−(1+hj(t))yij(t)],where the term−ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))represents a measure of the risk of the financial agent andrj(t)(1−τij(t))[xi(t)−(1+hj(t))yi(t)]represents the value of the difference between the asset holdings and the value of liabilities. An example of utility function is obtained by using variance-covariance matrices denoting the sector’s assessment of the standard deviation of prices for each instrument (see Markowitz, 1952 and Markowitz, 1959).First, we make the following assumptions Hypotheses 1, which will be denoted byHp. 1:•The sector’s utility function Ui(t, xi(t), yi(t)) is defined on[0,T]×Rn×Rn,is measurable in t and is continuous with respect to xi and yi.∂ui∂xijand∂ui∂yijexist and that they are measurable in t and continuous with respect to xiand yi.∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n,and a.e. in [0, T] the following growth conditions hold true:(1)|ui(t,x,y)|≤αi(t)∥x∥∥y∥,∀x,y∈Rn,and(2)|∂ui(t,x,y)∂xij|≤βij(t)∥y∥,|∂ui(t,x,y)∂yij|≤γij(t)∥x∥,whereαi, βij, γij are non-negative functions of L∞([0, T]).The function ui(t, x, y) is concave.−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xijand−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂yijare strictly monotone functions.Now we present in detail the model. The prices are unknown variables and they are determined by a demand-supply law, namely forj=1,…,nand a.e. in [0, T](3)∑i=1m(1−τij(t))[xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t)]+Fj(t){≥0ifrj*(t)=r̲j(t)=0ifr̲j(t)<rj*(t)<r¯j(t)≤0ifrj*(t)=r¯j(t),wherew*=(x*,y*,r*)is the equilibrium solution for the investments as assets and as liabilities and for the prices and Fj(t) ∈ L2([0, T]) is the quantity of financial transactions per unit employed to cover the expenses of the financial institutions including dividends and manager bonus.For technical reasons, we shall choose as the functional settingL2([0,T],Rp)={x:[0,T]→Rp|∫0T∥x(t)∥Rp2dt<+∞}where(∫0T∥x(t)∥Rp2dt)12=∥x∥L2([0,T],Rp).To denote the norm in the Hilbert spaceL2([0,T],Rp)we shall use the symbol ‖x‖ when there is no possibility of confusion. As is well known, the dual space ofL2([0,T],Rp)is stillL2([0,T],Rp)and we define the canonical bilinear form inL2([0,T],Rp)×L2([0,T],Rp)as:≪G,x≫=∫0T〈G(t),x(t)〉dt,G,x∈L2([0,T],Rp),where ⟨G(t), x(t)⟩ denotes the scalar product inRp.In order to define the constraint set, let us introduce the setE={w=(x(t),y(t),r(t))∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n):x(t)≥0,y(t)≥0,r̲(t)≤r(t)≤r¯(t)a.e.in[0,T]},withr̲(t)≤r¯(t)∈L2([0,T],Rn),0≤r̲(t)≤r¯(t)a.e. in [0, T]. It is easy to verify that E is a convex, bounded and closed subset ofL2([0,T],R2mn+n).IfK:E→2Eis the set-valued map defined as(4)K(w*)={w=(x(t),y(t),r(t))∈E:∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds),∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)a.e.in[0,T]i=1,…,m},thenK(w*)is the feasible set for every w* ∈ E.Now, we can give different but equivalent equilibrium conditions, each of which is useful to illustrate particular features of the equilibrium.Definition 2.1A vector of sector assets, liabilities and instrument pricesw*∈K(w*)is an equilibrium of the dynamic financial model if and only if∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n,and a.e. in [0, T], it satisfies the system of inequalities(5)−∂ui(t,x*,y*)∂xij−(1−τij(t))rj*(t)−μi(1)*(t)≥0,(6)−∂ui(t,x*,y*)∂yij+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj*(t)−μi(2)*(t)≥0,and equalities(7)xij*(t)[−∂ui(t,x*,y*)∂xij−(1−τij(t))rj*(t)−μi(1)*(t)]=0,(8)yij*(t)[−∂ui(t,x*,y*)∂xij+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj*(t)−μi(2)*(t)]=0,and{∑i=1m(xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t))+Fj(t)≥0∑i=1m[(xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t))+Fj(t)]rj*(t)=0,r*∈R,whereμi(1)*(t),μi(2)*(t)∈L2([0,T])are the Lagrange functions associated with the constraints∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)and∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)respectively.For additional details on Definition 2.1, see, for instance, Barbagallo et al. (2012) and Barbagallo et al. (2014).Also in this formulation we are dealing with Lagrange multipliers which are unknown a priori, but this has no influence because, as we shall see by means of Theorem 2.1, Definition 2.1 is equivalent to a variational inequality in whichμi(1)*(t)andμi(2)*(t)do not appear.Indeed, under assumptions Hp. 1, such an equilibrium is characterized by the following variational formulation.Theorem 2.1A vectorw*∈K(w*)is a dynamic financial equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the following variational inequality:(9)Findw*∈K(w*):∑i=1m∫0T{∑j=1n[−∂ui(t,xi*(t),yi*(t))∂xij−(1−τij(t))rj*(t)]·[xij(t)−xij*(t)]+∑j=1n[−∂ui(t,xi*(t),yi*(t))∂yij+(1−τij(t))rj*(t)(1+hj(t))]·[yij(t)−yij*(t)]}dt+∑j=1n∫0T∑i=1m{(1−τij(t))[xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t)]+Fj(t)}·[rj(t)−rj*(t)]dt≥0,∀w∈K(w*).For the proof see Barbagallo et al. (2012), Barbagallo et al. (2013a), Barbagallo, Daniele, Lorino, Maugeri, and Mirabella (2013b).The aim of this paper is to prove an existence result for (9). We shall get such an existence result by proving a general theorem which is interesting in itself.LetF:[0,T]×R2mn+n→R2mn+nbe such that the following condition is satisfied:Fismeasurableint∀w∈R2mn+n,continuousinwa.e.in[0,T]andthereexistsδ¯∈L2([0,T])suchthat(F)∥F(t,w)∥≤δ¯(t)+∥w∥a.e.in[0,T],w∈R2mn+n.First of all, we recall the definitions of a strongly monotone and a Fan-hemicontinuous mapping.Definition 2.2LetF:[0,T]×E→L2([0,T],R2mn+n). We say that F is strongly monotone in x and y and monotone in r if there exists ν > 0:〈F(t,w1(t))−F(t,w2(t)),w1(t)−w2(t)〉≥ν(∥x1−x2∥2+∥y1−y2∥2)∀w1(t)=(x1(t),y1(t),r1(t)),w2(t)=(x2(t),y2(t),r2(t))∈E.LetF:[0,T]×E→L2([0,T],R2mn+n). We say that F is Fan-hemicontinuous if ∀v ∈ E the functionw→≪F(t,w),w−v≫is weakly lower semicontinuous on E.Further, we make the following assumptions (α):•the functions s and l are Carathéodory functions, which means they are measurable in t and continuous with respect to the second variable;there exist δ1(t) ∈ L2([0, T]) andc1∈Rsuch that:∥s(t,x)∥≤δ1(t)+c1,∀x∈Rmn;there exist δ2(t) ∈ L2([0, T]) andc2∈Rsuch that:∥l(t,y)∥≤δ2(t)+c2,∀y∈Rmn.Now let us consider the following variational inequality:(10)Findw*∈K(w*):≪F(t,w*),w−w*≫≥0∀w∈K(w*).We can prove the following existence theorem.Theorem 2.2LetF:[0,T]×E→L2([0,T],R2mn+n)be a bounded, strongly monotone in x and y, monotone in r, Fan-hemicontinuous mapping and satisfying conditions (F) and (α). Then variational inequality(10)admits a solution.Now, let us remark that variational inequality (9) can be rewritten by using the operatorA(t,w):[0,T]×R2mn+n→R2mn+ndefined as follows:A(t,w)=A(t,x(t),y(t),r(t))=([−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij−rj(t)(1−τij(t))]ij,[−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂yij+rj(t)(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))]ij,[∑i=1m(1−τij(t))[xij(t)−(1+hj(t))yij(t)]+Fj(t)]j).Then variational inequality (9) becomes:(11)≪A(t,w*),w−w*≫≥0∀w∈K(w*).From Theorem 2.2 we deduce an existence theorem for variational inequality (11), namely we shall prove the following theorem.Theorem 2.3Under assumptions Hp. 1 and (α1)–(α3) variational inequality(11)admits a solution.We assume that ∀w ∈ E, thenw∈K(w).Hence, settingK¯(w)=K(w)−w,we get0∈K¯(w).As a consequence, replacingK(w)withK¯(w),the assumption0∈K¯(w)is always satisfied. In the sequel we shall use the notationK(w).In order to prove Theorem 2.2, let us recall that the following existence result holds true (see Scrimali, 2014, Theorem 3.2):Theorem 3.1Let F(t, w) satisfy all assumptions in Theorem2.2provided that the monotonicity on r is replaced by the strong monotonicity on r. Then, variational inequality(10)admits a solution.We remark that in this theorem it is required that the operator F(t, w) is strongly monotone in x, y and r. Hence, the aim of Theorem 2.2 is to show that, for the existence of solutions, it is enough to assume the operator F only monotone in r.To prove Theorem 2.2, let us consider the following variational inequality, for each fixedn∈N:(12)Findwn*∈K(wn*):〈F¯(t,wn*),w−wn*〉=〈F(t,wn*),w−wn*〉+1n∫0Trnj*(t)(rj(t)−rnj*(t))dt≥0,∀w∈K(wn*),whereK(wn*)={(xn(t),yn(t),rn(t))∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n):∑j=1nxnij(t)=si(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds),∑j=1nynij(t)=li(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds)a.e.in[0,T],xn(t)≥0,yn(t)≥0,r̲(t)≤rn(t)≤r¯(t)a.e.in[0,T]}.Variational inequality (12) is a perturbation of the previous variational inequality (10). We are following the same procedure presented by Stampacchia in (Stampacchia, 1969) (see Section 3).For the operatorF¯,as it is easy to see, all the assumptions of Theorem 3.1 are fulfilled. Then, there exists a unique solutionwn*∈K(wn*)to (12)∀n∈N.The set of solutions{wn*}turns out to be bounded in L2 by the definition ofK(wn*).Then, we can extract from{wn*}a subsequence, denoted, for the sake of simplicity, by{wn*},weakly convergent to somew˜∈L2(see, for instance, Brezis (1983), Theorem III, 16):wn*⇀w˜.We shall show thatw˜∈K(w˜).Taking into account thatwn*∈K(wn*),we have∑j=1nxnij*(t)=si(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds)andxnij*⇀x˜ij(t),hence∑j=1nxnij*(t)⇀∑j=1nx˜ij(t).Now, for every test function φ ∈ L2([0, T]), we get:limn∫0Tφ∑j=1nxnij*(t)=limn∫0Tφsi(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds)dt=∫0Tφ∑j=1nx˜ij(t).For assumption (α1) and taking into account thatlimn∫0Txn*(s)ds=∫0Tx˜(s)ds,we getlimnsi(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds)=si(t,∫0Tw˜(s)ds)andlimn∫0Tφsi(t,∫0Twn*(s)ds)dt=∫0Tφsi(t,∫0Tw˜(s)ds)dt.As a consequence for every φ we have:∫0Tφ[si(t,∫0Tw˜(s)ds)−∑j=1nx˜ij(t)]dt=0and thereforesi(t,∫0Tw˜(s)ds)=∑j=1nx˜ij(t).An analogous procedure can be applied to obtain:li(t,∫0Tw˜(s)ds)=∑j=1ny˜ij(t).It remains to prove that xi(t) ≥ 0 a.e. in [0, T]. For the sake of generality and forseeing future extensions of the model, we shall provex̲i(t)≤xi(t)≤x¯i(t)a.e.in[0,T].We shall just prove thatx̲i(t)≤x¯i(t). We know thatx̲i(t)≤x˜ni*(t). Then, for every nonnegative function φ ∈ L2([0, T]), in virtue of the weak convergence, we have:(13)0≤limn∫0Tφ(xni*(t)−x̲i(t))︸≥0dt=∫0Tφ(x˜i(t)−x̲i(t))dt.Now, let us assume ad absurdum there exists a subset E ⊂ [0, T] with positive measure such thatx˜i(t)−x̲i(t)<0in E. Then one chooses:φ¯={0in[0,T]∖Eφ>0inE.Hence, (13) becomes:∫0Tφ(x˜i(t)−x̲i(t))=∫Eφ(x˜i(t)−x̲i(t))<0which is an absurdity. An analogous procedure can be applied to show the other constraints and then obtainw˜∈K(w˜).Let us prove now thatw˜satisfies variational inequality:(14)≪F(t,w˜),w−w˜≫≥0∀w∈K(w˜).SinceF(t,w˜)is monotone, according to Minty’s Lemma (see Stampacchia, 1969, Lemma 2.2), (14) is equivalent to prove thatw˜is a solution to the following Minty variational inequality:(15)≪F(t,w),w−w˜≫≥0∀w∈K(w˜).Let us observe that if (12) is satisfied, then, according to Minty’s Lemma again,wn*is also a solution to:(16)≪F¯(t,w),w−wn*≫=≪F(t,w),w−wn*≫+1n∫0Trj(t)(rj(t)−rnj*(t))dt≥0,∀w∈K(wn*).In order to prove (14), let us recall that in Scrimali (2014) (see Lemma 3.1) the author has proved that the setK(w)is Mosco convergent; in particular we have that:∀w∈K(w˜)∃{wn}⊆K(wn):wn→winL2(R2mn+n).Since (16) is satisfied inK(wn*),we choose asw∈K(wn*)in (16) the element wnsuch that wn→ w.Then (16) becomes:(17)≪F(t,wn),wn−wn*≫+1n∫0Trnj(t)(rnj(t)−rnj*(t))dt≥0.We want to prove that (17) converges to (15). To this end we shall work separately on the two terms of (17). The first term is:≪F(t,wn),wn−wn*≫=≪F(t,wn),wn−w˜+w˜−wn*≫=≪F(t,wn),wn−w˜≫+≪F(t,wn),w˜−wn*≫.Let us remark that:•wn→ w, hencelimn≪F(t,wn),wn−w˜≫=≪F(t,w),w−w˜≫;From assumption (F), F is a Nemitski operator, so F(t, wn) → F(t, w) inL2(R2m+n)when wn→ w andw˜−wn*⇀0,hencelimn≪F(t,wn),w˜−wn*≫=≪F(t,w),w˜−w˜≫=0,indeed:limn≪F(t,wn),w˜−wn*≫=limn≪F(t,wn)−F(t,w),w˜−wn*≫+limn≪F(t,w),w˜−wn*≫=0.Therefore:limn≪F(t,wn),wn−wn*≫=≪F(t,w),w−w˜≫∀w∈K(w˜)Now we examine the second term:limn1n∫0Trnj(t)(rnj(t)−rnj*(t))dt=0,since1nconverges to 0,rnj*⇀rj(t)and sorj(t)−rnj*(t)is bounded.As a consequence:limn{≪F(t,wn),wn−wn*≫+1n∫0Trnj(t)(rnj(t)−rnj*(t))dt}=〈F(t,w),w−w˜〉,∀w∈K(w˜).Then the theorem is proved.□Now we are in position to prove Theorem 2.3.We apply Theorem 2.2 by choosing as the operator F the new operator A defined as follows:A(t,w):[0,T]×R2mn+n→R2mn+ndefined as follows:A(t,w)=A(t,x(t),y(t),r(t))=([−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij−rj(t)(1−τij(t))]ij,[−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂yij+rj(t)(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))]ij,[∑i=1m(1−τij(t))[xij(t)−(1+hj(t))yij(t)]+Fj(t)]j).The boundedness of A(t, w), which means:∃c∈R:∥A(t,w)∥L2([0,T],R2mn+n)≤c,trivially follows from assumption α2.Let us prove that A(t, w) is strongly monotone with respect to x and y, namely:∃ν>0:≪A(t,w1)−A(t,w2),w1−w2≫≥ν[∥x1−x2∥L22+∥y1−y2∥L22].We have:≪A(t,w1)−A(t,w2),w1−w2≫=∑i=1m∫0T{∑j=1n(−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂xij1+∂ui(t,xi2(t),yi2(t))∂xij2)×(xij1(t)−xij2(t))−∑j=1n(rj1(t)−rj2(t))(1−τij(t))(xij1(t)−xij2(t))+∑j=1n(−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂yij1+∂ui(t,xi2(t),yi2(t))∂yij2)×(yij1(t)−yij2(t))+∑j=1n(rj1(t)−rj2(t))(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))(yij1(t)−yij2(t))}dt+∑j=1n∫0T{∑i=1m(1−τij(t))(xij1(t)−xij2(t))(rj1(t)−rj2(t))−∑i=1m(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))(yij1(t)−yij2(t))(rj1(t)−rj2(t))}dt=∑i=1m∫0T{∑j=1n(−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂xij1+∂ui(t,xi2(t),yi2(t))∂xij2)×(xij1(t)−xij2(t))+(−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂yij1+∂ui(t,xi2(t),yi2(t))∂yij2)×(yij1(t)−yij2(t))}dt≥ν[∥x1−x2∥L22+∥y1−y2∥L22].The last inequality is easily achieved since, by assumptions, the functions−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂xij1and−∂ui(t,xi1(t),yi1(t))∂yij1are strictly monotone.Hence, A(t, w) is strongly monotone in x and y and only monotone in r.Now, we can prove that A(t, w) is Fan-hemicontinuous, namely:≪A(t,w),w−ξ≫isweaklylowersemicontinuous,whereξ=(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)is fixed. So we need to prove thatlim infn≪A(t,wn),wn−ξ≫≥≪A(t,w),w−ξ≫,∀{wn}suchthatwn⇀w.We have:≪A(t,wn),wn−ξ≫=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n(−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂xij−rjn(t)(1−τij(t)))×(xijn(t)−ξij1)dt+∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n(−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂yij+rjn(t)(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t)))(yijn(t)−ξij2)dt+∑i=1m∫0T{∑j=1n(1−τij(t))[xijn(t)−(1+hj(t))yijn(t)]+Fj(t)}×(rjn(t)−ξj3)dt=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂xij(xijn(t)−ξij1)dt+∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂yij(yijn(t)−ξij2)dt+∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T[−rjn(t)(1−τij(t))xijn(t)+rjn(t)(1−τij(t))ξij1+rjn(t)(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yijn(t)−rjn(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))ξij2+rjn(t)(1−τij(t))xijn(t)−xijn(t)(1−τij(t))ξj3−rjn(t)(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yijn(t)+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yijn(t)ξj3+Fj(t)(rjn(t)−ξj3)]dt=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂xij(xijn(t)−ξij1)dt+∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂yij(yijn(t)−ξij2)dt+∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T[rjn(t)(1−τij(t))ξij1−rjn(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))ξij2−xijn(t)(1−τij(t))ξj3+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yijn(t)ξj3+Fj(t)(rjn(t)−ξj3)]dt.For the weak convergence, we have:limn→∞∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Trjn(t)(1−τij(t))ξij1dt=∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Trj(t)(1−τij(t))ξij1dt;limn→∞∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T−rjn(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))ξij2dt=∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T−rj(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))ξij2dt;limn→∞∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T−xijn(t)(1−τij(t))ξj3dt=∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T−xij(t)(1−τij(t))ξj3dt;limn→∞∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yijn(t)ξj3dt=∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0T(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))yij(t)ξj3dt;limn→∞∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0TFj(t)(rjn(t)−ξj3)dt=∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0TFj(t)(rj(t)−ξj3)dt.It remains to prove thatlim infn→∞∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂xij(xijn(t)−ξij1)dt≥∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij(xij(t)−ξij1)dtand the analogous relation for yij(t). The operators−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xiare Nemitsky operators (see Fucik & Kufner, 1980) and then they areL2−continuous. Hence, we havelimn→∞∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xin(t),yin(t))∂xij(xijn(t)−ξij1)dt=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij(xij(t)−ξij1)dt∀{xn}:xn⟶xinL2,namely the strong continuity of the operator−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij(xij(t)−ξij1).Then, taking into account that−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xijand−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂yijare convex and monotone, it is easy to prove that the operator∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂xij(xij(t)−ξij1)+∑i=1m∑j=1n−∂ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))∂yij(yij(t)−ξij2)is convex (see Maugeri & Raciti, 2008). Indeed, if a function is continuous and convex, then it is weakly lower semicontinuous. Hence function A(t, w) is Fan-hemicontinuous.□In this section we recall the infinite dimensional duality (see Barbagallo et al., 2014; Daniele, Giuffré, Maugeri, and Raciti, 2014; Maugeri and Puglisi, 2014 and Scrimali, 2012) for the general financial equilibrium problem expressed by variational inequality (9). The infinite dimensional duality allows us to define the evaluation index E(t), which will be used in the sequel.The first step is to introduce the Lagrange functional for this general model. To this end, as usual, let us setf(x,y,r)=∫0T{∑i=1m∑j=1n[−∂ui(t,x*(t),y*(t))∂xij−(1−τij(t))rj*(t)]×[xij(t)−xij*(t)]+∑i=1m∑j=1n[−∂ui(t,x*(t),y*(t))∂yij+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj*(t)][yij(t)−yij*(t)]+∑j=1n[∑i=1m(1−τij(t))[xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t)]+Fj(t)][rj(t)−rj*(t)]}dt.Then the Lagrange functional is(18)L(x,y,r,λ(1),λ(2),μ(1),μ(2),ρ(1),ρ(2))=f(x,y,r)−∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(1)(t)xij(t)dt−∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(2)yij(t)dt−∑i=1m∫0Tμi(1)(t)(∑j=1nxij(t)−s^i(t))dt−∑i=1m∫0Tμi(2)(t)(∑j=1nyij(t)−l^i(t))dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(1)(t)(r̲j(t)−rj(t))dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(2)(t)(rj(t)−r¯j(t))dt,where(x,y,r)∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n),λ(1),λ(2)∈L2([0,T],R+mn),μ(1),μ(2)∈L2([0,T],Rm),ρ(1),ρ(2)∈L2([0,T],R+n).Remember that λ(1), λ(2), ρ(1), ρ(2) are the Lagrange multipliers associated, a.e. in [0, T], with the sign constraints xi(t) ≥ 0 , yi(t) ≥ 0,rj(t)−r̲j(t)≥0,r¯j(t)−rj(t)≥0,respectively. The functions μ(1)(t) and μ(2)(t) are the Lagrange multipliers associated, a.e. in [0, T], with the equality constraints∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)=s^i(t)and∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t,∫0Tw*(s)ds)=l^i(t),respectively.Now we recall the following theorem (see Barbagallo et al., 2014 for the proof).Theorem 4.1Letw*=(x*,y*,r*)∈K(w*)be a solution to variational inequality (9) and let us consider the associated Lagrange functional (18). Then, the strong duality holds and there existλ(1)*,λ(2)*∈L2([0,T],R+mn),μ(1)*,μ(2)*∈L2([0,T],Rm),ρ(1)*,ρ(2)*∈L2([0,T],R+n)such that (x*, y*, r*, λ(1)*, λ(2)*, μ(1)*, μ(2)*, ρ(1)*, ρ(2)*) is a saddle point of the Lagrange functional, namelyL(x*,y*,r*,λ(1),λ(2),μ(1),μ(2),ρ(1),ρ(2))≤L(x*,y*,r*,λ(1)*,λ(2)*,μ(1)*,μ(2)*,ρ(1)*,ρ(2)*)=0≤L(x,y,r,λ(1)*,λ(2)*,μ(1)*,μ(2)*,ρ(1)*,ρ(2)*)∀(x,y,r)∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n),∀λ(1),λ(2)∈L2([0,T],R+mn),∀μ(1),μ(2)∈L2([0,T],Rm),∀ρ(1),ρ(2)∈L2([0,T],R+n)and, a.e. in [0, T],−∂ui(t,x*(t),y*(t))∂xij−(1−τij(t))rj*(t)−λij(1)*(t)−μi(1)*(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1…,n;−∂ui(t,x*(t),y*(t))∂yij+(1−τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj*(t)−λij(2)*(t)−μi(2)*(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1…,n;(19)∑i=1m(1−τij(t))[xij*(t)−(1+hj(t))yij*(t)]+Fj(t)+ρj(2)*(t)=ρj(1)*(t),∀j=1,…,n;(20)λij(1)*(t)xij*(t)=0,λij(2)*(t)yij*(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n(21)μi(1)*(t)(∑j=1nxij*(t)−s^i(t))=0,μi(2)*(t)(∑j=1nyij*(t)−l^i(t))=0,∀i=1,…,m;(22)ρj(1)*(t)(r̲j(t)−rj*(t))=0,ρj(2)*(t)(rj*(t)−r¯j(t))=0,∀j=1,…,n.We define “Evaluation Index” the valueE(t)=∑i=1ml^i(t)∑i=1ms˜i(t)+∑j=1nF˜j(t),wheres˜i(t)=s^i(t)1+i(t)andF˜j(t)=Fj(t)1+i(t)−θ(t)−θ(t)i(t).We state that, if E(t) is greater than or equal to 1, the evaluation of the financial equilibrium is positive, whereas if E(t) is less than 1, the evaluation of the financial equilibrium is negative.In fact, we know thatE(t)=1−∑j=1nρj(1)*(t)(1−θ(t))(1+i(t))(∑i=1ms˜i(t)+∑j=1nF˜j(t))+∑j=1nρj(2)*(t)(1−θ(t))(1+i(t))(∑i=1ms˜i(t)+∑j=1nF˜j(t)).If E(t) < 1, it means that∑j=1nρj(2)*(t)<∑j=1nρj(1)*(t)and this implies that the sum of deficits exceeds the sum of surpluses and we find a negative outlook.On the other hand if E(t) ≥ 1, then∑j=1nρj(2)*(t)≥∑j=1nρj(1)*(t)and we have already considered the positive effects of this surplus.The Evaluation Index has been fixed assuming that the taxes τij(t),i=1,…,m,j=1,…,nhave a common value θ(t), and the increments hj(t),j=1,…,n,have a common value i(t). However it can also be considered the case when τij(t), hj(t) are all different, assuming θ(t) and i(t) as the averages of τij(t) and hj(t), namelyθ(t)=∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)mnandi(t)=∑j=1nhj(t)n,respectively. Also in this case the Evaluation Index gives reliable information.We consider a special utility function, specifically the quadratic utility function obtained by means of the variance-covariance matrix which denotes the sector’s assessment of the standard deviation of prices for each instrument. In detail, we consider an economy with two agents and two financial instruments. The variance-covariance matrices of the two agents are:Q1=[10−0.500100−0.50100001]andQ2=[100001−0.500−0.5100001].In the time interval [0, 1], the term ui(t, xi(t), yi(t)) is given by:ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))=−[xi(t)yi(t)]TQi[xi(t)yi(t)].We choose as the feasible set for assets, liabilities and prices:K(w*)={w=(x(t),y(t),r(t))∈L2([0,1],R+10):x11(t)+x12(t)=α∫01r1*(s)ds+β,x21(t)+x22(t)=α∫01r2*(s)ds+β,y11(t)+y12(t)=γ,y21(t)+y22(t)=δ,a.e.in[0,1]and2t≤r1(t)≤5tandt≤r2(t)≤10ta.e.in[0,1]}where α, β and δ are positive parameters to be appropriately fixed. It follows that variational inequality (9) becomes the problem:Findw*∈K(w*):∫01([2(x11*(t)−0.5y11*(t))−(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)](x11(t)−x11*(t))+[2x12*(t)−(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)](x12(t)−x12*(t))+[2x21*(t)−(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)](x21(t)−x21*(t))+[2(x22*(t)−0.5y21*(t))−(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)](x22(t)−x22*(t))+[2(y11*(t)−0.5x11*(t))+(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))]×(y11(t)−y11*(t))+[2y12*(t)+(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y12(t)−y12*(t))+[2(y21*(t)−0.5x22*(t))+(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))]×(y21(t)−y21*(t))+[2y22*(t)+(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y22(t)−y22*(t))+{(1−τ11(t))[x11*(t)−(1+h1(t))y11*(t)]+(1−τ21(t))[x21*(t)−(1+h1(t))y21*(t)]+F1(t)}×(r1(t)−r1*(t))+{(1−τ12(t))[x12*(t)−(1+h2(t))y12*(t)]+(1−τ22(t))[x22*(t)−(1+h2(t))y22*(t)]+F2(t)}×(r2(t)−r2*(t)))dt≥0∀w∈K(w*).From the conservation laws, we get:x12(t)=α∫0Tr1*(s)ds−x11(t)+β,x21(t)=α∫0Tr2*(s)ds−x22(t)+βy12(t)=−y11(t)+γ,y21(t)=−y22(t)+δ.So, we have:(23)∫01([4x11*(t)−y11*(t)−2α∫0Tr1*(s)ds−2β−(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)+(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)](x11(t)−x11*(t))+[4x22*(t)+y22*(t)−2α∫0Tr2*(s)ds−2β−δ+(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)−(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)](x22(t)−x22*(t))+[4y11*(t)−x11*(t)−2γ+(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))−(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y11(t)−y11*(t))+[4y22*(t)+x22*(t)−2δ−(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))+(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y22(t)−y22*(t))+{(1−τ11(t))[x11*(t)−(1+h1(t))y11*(t)]+(1−τ21(t))[α∫0Tr2*(s)ds−x22*(t)+β−(1+h1(t))(−y22*(t)+δ)]+F1(t)}(r1(t)−r1*(t))+{(1−τ12(t))[α∫0Tr1*(s)ds−x11*(t)+β−(1+h2(t))(−y11*(t)+γ)]+(1−τ22(t))[x22*(t)−(1+h2(t))y22*(t)]+F2(t)}×(r2(t)−r2*(t))dt≥0.Applying the direct method (see Maugeri, 1987) and choosingτij=14∀i, j andhj=1∀j, we find that the solution to the variational inequality (23) is given by solving the system{Γ1=4x11*(t)−y11*(t)−2α∫01r1*(s)ds−2β−34r1*+34r2*=0Γ2=4x22*(t)+y22*(t)−2α∫01r2*(s)ds−2β−δ+34r1*−34r2*=0Γ3=4y11*(t)−x11*(t)−2γ+32r1*−32r2*=0Γ4=4y22*(t)+x22*(t)−2δ−32r1*+32r2*=0Γ5=34[x11*(t)−2y11*(t)]+34[α∫01r2*(s)ds−x22*+β−2(−y22*+δ)]+F1>0Γ6=34[α∫01r1*(s)ds−x11*+β−2(−y11*+γ)]+34[x22*(t)−2y22*(t)]+F2>0.Since Γ5 > 0 and Γ6 > 0, the direct method ensures thatr1*(t)=r1̲(t)=2tr2*(t)=r2̲(t)=t.Moreover, since∫01r1*(t)dt=∫012tdt=1and∫01r2*(t)dt=∫01tdt=12,the system:{Γ1=0⇔4x11*(t)−y11*(t)=2α+2β+34tΓ2=0⇔4x22*(t)+y22*(t)=α+2β+δ−34tΓ3=0⇔4y11*(t)−x11*(t)=2γ−32tΓ4=0⇔4y22*(t)+x22*(t)=2δ+32tyields:{y11*(t)=115(2α+2β+8γ−214t)y22*(t)=115(−α−2β+7δ+274t)x11*(t)=815(α+β)+215γ+110tx22*(t)=415(α+2β)+215δ−310t.Further, Γ5 > 0 and Γ6 > 0 mean:F1>710γ+910δ−1140α−720β−32tF2>45γ+35δ−1720α−2320β+32tNow, we verify that the following conditions are fulfilled:0≤x11*(t)≤β+α0≤y11*(t)≤γ0≤x22*(t)≤β+12α0≤y22*(t)≤δWe have:•x11*(t)≤β+α⇔α+β≥27γ+314in[0,1]x22*(t)≥0⇔α+2β≥−12δ+98in[0,1]x22*(t)≤β+12α⇔α+2β≥47δin[0,1]y11*(t)≥0⇔α+β≥−4γ+218in[0,1]y11*(t)≤γ⇔α+β≤72γin[0,1]y22*(t)≥0⇔α+2β≤7δin[0,1]y22*(t)≤δ⇔α+2β≥274−8δin[0,1]So:max{−12δ+98,47δ,274−8δ}≤α+2β≤7δin[0,1]max{27γ+314,−4γ+218}≤α+β≤72γin[0,1].Now, we chooseα=2,β=5,δ=2,γ=10and, replacing these values in the equilibrium solution, we obtain a.e. in t ∈ [0, 1]:{x11*(t)=7615+110t,x22*(t)=5215−310t,y11*(t)=9415−720t,y22*(t)=215+920t,and{x12*(t)=2915−110t,x21*(t)=3815+310t,y12*(t)=5615+720t,y21*(t)=2815−920t.Finally, conditions Γ5 > 0 and Γ6 > 0 yield:F1>132in [0, 1] andF2>134in [0, 1]. From formulas (19)and (22) we know that:Γ5+ρ1(2)*(t)=ρ1(1)*(t)andΓ6+ρ2(2)*(t)=ρ2(1)*(t)andρ1(1)*(t)(r̲1(t)−r1*(t))=0andρ1(2)*(t)(r1*(t)−r¯1(t))=0,ρ2(2)*(t)(r̲2(t)−r2*(t))=0andρ2(2)*(t)(r2*(t)−r¯2(t))=0.Sincer1*(t)=r̲1(t),we obtainρ1(1)*(t)>0andρ1(2)*(t)=0;hence:Γ5=ρ1(1)*(t)>0.Analogously, sincer2*(t)=r̲2(t),we obtainρ2(1)*(t)>0andρ2(2)*(t)=0;hence:Γ6=ρ2(1)*(t)>0.Butρ1(1)*(t)andρ2(1)*(t)are the deficit variables and are positive. So the economy is in a phase of regression. The same conclusion is confirmed by the evaluation index whose value, in this example, isE(t)=7283<1.With the same data as in Example 1, but with the new feasible set defined as:K(w*)={w=(x(t),y(t),r(t))∈L2([0,1],R+10):x11(t)+x12(t)=α∫01r1*(s)ds+β,x21(t)+x22(t)=α∫01r2*(s)ds+β,y11(t)+y12(t)=γ,y21(t)+y22(t)=δ,a.e.in[0,1]andt≤r1(t)≤2tandt≤r2(t)≤10ta.e.in[0,1]}now we solve the system:{Γ1=0Γ2=0Γ3=0Γ4=0Γ5<0Γ6>0and the direct method ensures thatr1*(t)=r¯1(t)=2tandr2*(t)=r̲2(t)=t,which yield: F1 < 5 andF2>134. With the same remarks as in Example 1, here we have:Γ5=ρ1(2)*(t)and the evaluation index isE(t)=7267>1. So the economy is positive.Let’s modify the conservations laws as follows:K(w*)={w=(x(t),y(t),r(t))∈L2([0,1],R+10):x11(t)+x12(t)=α∫01x1*(s)ds+β,x21(t)+x22(t)=α∫01x2*(s)ds+β,y11(t)+y12(t)=γ,y21(t)+y22(t)=δ,a.e.in[0,1]and2t≤r1(t)≤5tandt≤r2(t)≤10ta.e.in[0,1]}Then, variational inequality (23) becomes:∫01([4x11*(t)−y11*(t)−2α∫0Tx1*(s)ds−2β−(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)+(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)](x11(t)−x11*(t))+[4x22*(t)+y22*(t)−2α∫0Tx2*(s)ds−2β−δ+(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)−(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)](x22(t)−x22*(t))+[4y11*(t)−x11*(t)−2γ+(1−τ11(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))−(1−τ12(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y11(t)−y11*(t))+[4y22*(t)+x22*(t)−2δ−(1−τ21(t))r1*(t)(1+h1(t))+(1−τ22(t))r2*(t)(1+h2(t))](y22(t)−y22*(t))+{(1−τ11(t))[x11*(t)−(1+h1(t))y11*(t)]+(1−τ21(t))×[α∫0Tx2*(s)ds−x22*(t)+β−(1+h1(t))(−y22*(t)+δ)]+F1(t)}(r1(t)−r1*(t))+{(1−τ12(t))×[α∫0Tx1*(s)ds−x11*(t)+β−(1+h2(t))(−y11*(t)+γ)]+(1−τ22(t))[x22*(t)−(1+h2(t))y22*(t)]+F2(t)}×(r2(t)−r2*(t))dt≥0.Applying the direct method and choosingτij=14∀i, j andhj=1∀j, we obtain the solution to variational inequality (23) given by the solution to the system:{Γ1=4x11*(t)−y11*(t)−2α∫01x11*(s)ds−2β−34(r1*(t)−r2*(t))=0Γ2=4x22*(t)+y22*(t)−2α∫01x22*(s)ds−2β−δ+34(r1*(t)−r2*(t))=0Γ3=4y11*(t)−x11*(t)−2γ+32(r1*(t)−r2*(t))=0Γ4=4y22*(t)+x22*(t)−2δ−32(r1*(t)−r2*(t))=0Γ5=34[x11*(t)−2y11*(t)]+34[α∫01x22*(s)ds−x22*+β−2(−y22*+δ)]+F1>0Γ6=34[α∫01x11*(s)ds−x11*+β−2(−y11*+γ)]+34[x22*(t)−2y22*(t)]+F2>0Since Γ5 > 0 and Γ6 > 0, the direct method guarantees thatr1*(t)=r̲1(t)=2tandr2*(t)=r̲2(t)=t.Moreover, since∫01r1*(t)dt=∫012tdt=1and∫01r2*(t)dt=∫01tdt=12,choosingβ=3andr1*(t)−r2*(t)=tthe previous system gives:x11*(t)=110t+85+215γ+665(15−8α)α+1615(15−8α)αγy11*(t)=−720t+25+815γ+3310(15−8α)α+415(15−8α)αγx22*(t)=−310t+85+215δ+585(15−8α)α+1615(15−8α)αδy22*(t)=920t−25+715δ−2910(15−8α)α−415(15−8α)αδ.Now we verify:0≤x11*(t)≤α∫01x11*(s)ds+β0≤x22*(t)≤α∫01x22*(s)ds+β0≤y11*(t)≤γ0≤y22*(t)≤δThe first one equation is verified forα=1andβ=3and ∀γ; the second one forα=1,β=3and ∀δ; the third one forα=1and γ ≥ 183/90; the last one forα=1and δ ≥ 171/90.If we chooseα=1,β=3,γ=6,δ=6,we obtain a.e. in [0, 1] the following solution:{x11*(t)=110t+18235x22*(t)=−310t+17435y11*(t)=−720t+30170y22*(t)=920t+12370and{x12*(t)=−110t+6120x21*(t)=310t+5720y12*(t)=720t+1710y21*(t)=−920t+29770.Moreover, Γ5 > 0 and Γ6 > 0 meanF1>591112andF2>75112in [0, 1]. Also in this case we have a negative economy as stated by the evaluation index whose value isE(t)=10081067<1.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper we have proved a general existence theorem for quasi-variational inequalities.Moreover we have applied such a general result to the quasi-variational inequality governing the financial model in the case when the financial volumes depend on time and on the expected solution. Such a dependence is required in order to take care also of the influence of the expected equilibrium distribution for assets and liabilities on the investments on all financial instruments.We have also recalled the definition of the evaluation index, a very useful tool which allows us to realize if the financial equilibrium is positive or negative.Finally we have presented three numerical examples and have obtained the equilibrium solutions by using the direct method. The study cases show both regression and positive situations, as proved also by the evaluation indices.Since, as we have seen in the introduction, many problems, arising from economics, physics, engineering and so on, can be formulated in terms of quasi-variational inequalities, the importance of the proved general existence theorem for quasi-variational inequalities is evident in itself. Moreover, the paper Daniele et al. (2005b) is completely based on such an existence theorem.
