@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A mixture of skew-tfactor analyzers is introduced as well as a family of mixture models based thereon. The particular formulation of the skew-tdistribution used arises as a special case of the generalized hyperbolic distribution. Like their Gaussian andt-distribution analogues, mixtures of skew-tfactor analyzers are very well-suited for model-based clustering of high-dimensional data. The alternating expectation–conditional maximization algorithm is used for model parameter estimation and the Bayesian information criterion is used for model selection. The models are applied to both real and simulated data, giving superior clustering results when compared to a well-established family of Gaussian mixture models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Model-based clustering employs finite mixture models to estimate the group memberships of a given set of unlabeled observations. A finite mixture model has density of the formf(x∣ϑ)=∑g=1Gπgfg(x∣θg), whereπg>0, with∑g=1Gπg=1, are the mixing proportions,ϑ=(π1,…,πG,θ1,…,θG)is the vector of parameters, andfg(x∣θg)is thegth component density. Traditionally, model-based clustering has been performed with the component densities taken to be multivariate Gaussian. However, there has recently been significant interest in non-Gaussian approaches to mixture model-based clustering (e.g.,  Peel and McLachlan, 2000; McLachlan et al., 2007; Karlis and Meligkotsidou, 2007; Lin, 2009; Browne et al., 2012; Lee and McLachlan, 2012; Morris and McNicholas, 2013; Morris et al., 2013; Vrbik and McNicholas, 2012, 2014; Franczak et al., 2014).Browne and McNicholas (2013) introduced a mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions with model densityf(x∣ϑ)=∑g=1Gπgξ(x∣ϑg), where(1)ξ(x∣ϑg)=[χg+δ(x,μg|Σg)ψg+αg′Σg−1αg](λg−p/2)/2[ψg/χg]λg/2Kλg−p/2([ψg+αg′Σg−1αg][χg+δ(x,μg|Σg)])(2π)p/2∣Σg∣1/2Kλg(χgψg)exp{(μg−x)′Σg−1αg}is the density of the generalized hyperbolic distribution,ϑg=(λg,χg,ψg,μg,Σg,αg)is a vector of parameters, andδ(x,μ∣Σ)=(x−μ)′Σ−1(x−μ)is the squared Mahalanobis distance betweenxandμ. As we will discuss herein (Section  3.2), the skew-tdistribution can be obtained as a special case of the generalized hyperbolic distribution (cf.  Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, 2001; Aas and Haff, 2006).Several alternative formulations of the multivariate skew-tdistribution have appeared in the literature (e.g.,  Sahu et al., 2003; Branco and Dey, 2001; Jones and Faddy, 2003; Ma and Genton, 2004). The formulation of the distribution arising from the generalized hyperbolic distribution is chosen for this work because of its particularly attractive form, i.e., because its form is particularly conducive to the development of skew-tfactor analyzers (cf. Section  3.2). Furthermore, this form of the multivariate skew-tdistribution has computational advantages (cf. Section  3.3) and it has not previously been used for model-based clustering.In this paper, we use this formulation of the skew-tdistribution to introduce a skew-tanalogue of the mixture of factor analyzers model, as well as a family of parsimonious models based thereon. The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. In Section  2, we go through some important background material. Then we introduce our methodology (cf. Section  3), and illustrate our approach on real and simulated data (Section  4). The paper concludes with a discussion and suggestions for future work (Section  5).
