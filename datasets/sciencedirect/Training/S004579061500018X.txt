@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The risk of reinsurance portfolios covering globally occurring natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, is quantified by employing simulations. These simulations are computationally intensive and require large amounts of data to be processed. The use of many-core hardware accelerators, such as the Intel Xeon Phi and the NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), are desirable for achieving high-performance risk analytics. In this paper, we set out to investigate how accelerators can be employed in risk analytics, focusing on developing parallel algorithms for Aggregate Risk Analysis, a simulation which computes the Probable Maximum Loss of a portfolio taking both primary and secondary uncertainties into account. The key result is that both hardware accelerators are useful in different contexts; without taking data transfer times into account the Phi had lowest execution times when used independently and the GPU along with a host in a hybrid platform yielded best performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Risk analytics [1] has become an integral part of a business process in a range of domains including structural inspections [2], nuclear power plants [3] and radioactive waste disposal [4]. Large datasets are consumed by a risk model and hundreds of thousands or even millions of time consuming simulations are performed. Here the application of parallel and high-performance computing techniques are attractive.Interestingly, in the financial risk domain, specifically insurance and reinsurance, where data sizes are as large or even larger than what is employed in the above domains, relatively fewer parallel and high-performance computing techniques have been applied. Given the dependencies of the insurance and reinsurance setting on volatile markets, simulations that can be performed in a timely manner are essential.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and Phis, are attractive for accelerating applications that require HPC solutions, since they are low budget platforms. Risk analytics is one such domain that can hugely benefit from hardware accelerators. In this research, we set out to investigate which hardware accelerator is more beneficial for high-performance risk analytics. ARA, a Monte Carlo like simulation that considers primary and secondary uncertainties for estimating portfolio wide risk is chosen as a candidate application. Parallel algorithms to speedup the risk simulation are implemented on multi-core CPUs, hardware accelerators and hybrid platforms comprising CPUs and accelerators. Experimental studies are pursued on CPUs such as the Intel i7 and the Intel Xeon, and on accelerators, such as the NVIDIA GPU and the Intel Phi, for evaluating the performance of ARA.Both the Phi and the GPU are competing hardware accelerators and useful in different contexts for high-performance risk analytics. Overall, the experimental study indicates that for individual performance, when execution times are only considered without taking into account the data transfer times, the Phi outperforms the GPU by 23% achieving a speed up of 21× over a baseline implementation; for a typical simulation of 800,000 trials with each trial comprising 1000 events and 16 extended ELTs, the Phi individually requires only 42s against 55s required by the GPU. However, the Phi as an independent processor is impractical in a large number of cases and is best suited as a coprocessor in a hybrid platform. The Xeon and Phi hybrid platform is 50% slower than the combination of i7 and the GPU. For the typical simulation on hybrid platforms, the i7 and GPU combination takes only 41s, which is 16× faster than a baseline implementation, compared to 63s required by Xeon and Phi.
