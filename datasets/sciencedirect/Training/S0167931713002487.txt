@&#ABSTRACT@&#
High-κ dielectric gate stacks comprising HfO2 were fabricated on Ge with alumina as the barrier level. This was achieved by thermal annealing in an ultra high vacuum to remove the native oxide followed by deposition of aluminium by molecular beam epitaxy. After in situ oxidation at ambient temperature, HfO2 was deposited by atomic layer deposition. The devices underwent physical and electrical characterisation and show low EOT down to 1.3nm, low leakage current of less than 10−7Acm−2 at ±1V, and CV hysteresis of ∼10mV.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Germanium (Ge) is a candidate channel material for sub-16nm CMOS technology node pMOST devices due to its higher hole (×4) mobility compared with silicon. High-κ dielectrics, such as hafnia (HfO2), are needed to achieve the equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOT) required at this scale, whilst maintaining sufficiently low leakage current density. Direct deposition of HfO2 onto Ge leads to high interface state density (Dit) [1] and a thin native oxide, GeO2 interfacial layer (IL) has been shown to be effective for reducing Dit. However, Ge suffers from desorption of volatile GeO to the surface, which causes device instability, high Dit and mobility degradation [2]. A variety of methods have been used for capping the IL to prevent desorption of GeO. Recently alumina (Al2O3) has been proposed as an interlayer between Ge and HfO2 to act as a diffusion barrier [3,4] and stabilize a very thin GeO2 layer on the Ge channel to achieve a low Dit. One approach to form the Al2O3 interlayer is to deposit a thin layer of Al metal by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and subsequently oxidize it to form an Al2O3/GeO2/Ge structure [5]. We report here the use of such a passivation scheme, combined with HfO2 as a high-κ layer, to achieve an EOT as low as 1.3nm with an acceptable leakage current of less than 10−7Acm−2 at ±1V.Ge (100) wafers (n- and p-type) were cleaned in ultra high vacuum (<10−6mbar) at 500°C and 600°C for 10min to evaporate any native oxide and so achieve an oxide free surface. Subsequently, wafers were exposed to an Al flux for a range of times to deposit ultrathin Al layers. The samples were then oxidized at ambient temperatures in the MBE load lock to produce Al2O3 layers. The samples were transferred within 1min to an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor and thin films of HfO2 were deposited on the Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The HfO2 depositions used a [(CpMe)2HfOMeMe] precursor coupled with an O2 plasma as the oxidizing species. Between 30 and 130 ALD cycles were used to grow HfO2 thicknesses from 1.6 to 7nm at 250°C. For electrical measurements, circular gold contacts of area 1.96×10−3cm2 were deposited onto the films to form MOS gate electrodes and Al was deposited on the back of the Ge wafers to provide an ohmic contact. After preliminary measurements, the samples were annealed in forming gas (FGA) at 350°C for 30min. The oxide leakage current was measured using a Keithley 230B voltage source and Keithley 617B electrometer. The HP 4192A low frequency (LF) impedance analyzer at small signal frequencies between 100Hz to 1MHz was used to perform high frequency capacitance–voltage (HF CV) measurements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
ALD hafnia high-κ dielectric gate stack was fabricated on Ge with alumina as the barrier level using combined MBE and ALD technique and have been characterised by physical and electrical techniques. The devices show low EOT down to 1.3nm, low leakage current of less than 10−7Acm−2 at ±1V, and CV hysteresis of ca. 10mV. The thicknesses of GeO2 interfacial layer and alumina barrier layer were estimated by comparing samples with different high-κ thickness. The forming gas anneal indicates an improvement in the shape of CV plots due to reduction of interface states. Thermal cleaning at higher temperature reduces the thickness of GeO2 resulting in an improved EOT.
