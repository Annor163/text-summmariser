@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy is a powerful tool for fast label-free tissue imaging, which is promising for early medical diagnostics. To facilitate the diagnostic process, automatic image analysis algorithms, which are capable of extracting relevant features from the image content, are needed. In this contribution we perform an automated classification of healthy and tumor areas in CARS images of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) skin samples. The classification is based on extraction of texture features from image regions and subsequent classification of these regions into healthy and cancerous with a perceptron algorithm. The developed approach is capable of an accurate classification of texture types with high sensitivity and specificity, which is an important step towards an automated tumor detection procedure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) – which originate from basal cells – is the most frequent cancer in humans [1]. The diagnostics of this tumor can be highly complicated because of its diverse morphological manifestation [2]. Currently, the skin cancer is diagnosed – additionally to visual inspection – by a punch biopsy with subsequent histopathological analysis of H&E stained tissue sections [3,4]. This procedure is invasive, time-consuming and associated with high costs. However, early tumor detection is crucial for successful medical treatment and increase of survival rates [5].Raman micro-spectroscopy [6–9] allows to visualize the molecular composition of tissue without the need for any external staining, which enables non-invasive high-resolution in vivo imaging. The use of a non-linear variant of Raman – e.g. coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy – allows to circumvent the problem of long acquisition time intrinsic to spontaneous Raman scattering [6] and hence enables real-time in-vivo tissue visualization [10,11]. Along with CARS, other nonlinear techniques such as two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) [12] and second harmonic generation (SHG) [13–15] are reported in biomedical imaging. Moreover, the combination of these techniques – referred to as multimodal imaging – is also a powerful tool for label-free tissue investigation [16–18]. Different NLO microscopy techniques and their combination have been successfully applied for visualization of BCC [19–21], which is significant for the decrease of costs and facilitation of diagnostics of this skin cancer.Manual analysis of the microscopy data is, however, time-consuming and often subjective, especially for the cases, when quantitative assessment of the sample is required (e.g. estimation of tumor size). Computerized evaluation and classification of tissue images can facilitate the disease diagnostics and is indispensable for screening [22]. A number of approaches has been developed towards automated tissue classification based on magnetic resonance [23–25], computed tomography [26,27] and ultrasound images [28]. Moreover, automatic algorithms have been proposed to analyze skin lesions in photographic images [29,30], and for breast cancer detection in histopathological images [31]. Automated image analysis in nonlinear optical microscopy is still in its infancy, because this technique is relatively new. E.g., several approaches have been recently published concerning automated analysis of CARS images. In particular, procedures for separation of CARS signal from non-resonant background have been developed [32,33]. Moreover, several methods for the extraction of cell nuclei from the CARS images have been proposed [34–36] along with an approach for the discrimination of lung carcinoma types based on the analysis of nuclei properties [37]. Automated detection of BCC lesions in histopathological images had been performed so far only based on Raman microscopy [38,39]. However, for automatized real-time label-free screening, a BCC recognition approach based on nonlinear optical microscopy techniques is needed.In this contribution, we – for the first time – performed an automated classification of healthy and cancerous tissue patterns in CARS images of BCC, which is an initial step towards a computerized procedure for detection of BCC lesions in nonlinear optical microscopy images. This classification was based on the analysis of image texture in normal skin and tumor regions. In order to optimize the classification outcome, the first comprehensive test of various texture descriptors for CARS image classification was performed here. Moreover, an automatic feature selection framework was implemented to select the features that are optimal for a particular classification problem. The details of the image analysis and classification are discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 after a brief description of the image acquisition procedure (Section 2.1). Then, the results of the texture classification are presented and discussed (Section 3).
