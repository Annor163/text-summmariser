@&#ABSTRACT@&#
One of the most common signs of tiredness or fatigue is yawning. Naturally, identification of fatigued individuals would be helped if yawning is detected. Existing techniques for yawn detection are centred on measuring the mouth opening. This approach, however, may fail if the mouth is occluded by the hand, as it is frequently the case. The work presented in this paper focuses on a technique to detect yawning whilst also allowing for cases of occlusion. For measuring the mouth opening, a new technique which applies adaptive colour region is introduced. For detecting yawning whilst the mouth is occluded, local binary pattern (LBP) features are used to also identify facial distortions during yawning. In this research, the Strathclyde Facial Fatigue (SFF) database which contains genuine video footage of fatigued individuals is used for training, testing and evaluation of the system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fatigue is usually perceived as the feeling of tiredness or drowsiness. In a work related context, fatigue is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion that reduces the ability to perform work safely and effectively. Fatigue can result due to a number of factors including inadequate rest, excessive physical or mental activity, sleep pattern disturbances, or excessive stress. There are many conditions which can affect individuals and which are considered directly related to fatigue such as visual impairment, reduced hand–eye coordination, low motivation, poor concentration, slow reflexes, sluggish response or inability to concentrate. Fatigue is considered as the largest contributor to road accidents, leading to loss of lives. Data for 2010 from the Department of Transport, UK [1], points to 1850 people killed, and 22,660 seriously injured, with fatigue contributing to 20% to the total number of accidents [2]. US National Highway Traffic Safety estimates suggest that approximately 100,000 accidents each year are caused by fatigue [3].Fatigue is identifiable from human physiology such as eye and mouth observations, brain activity, and by using electrocardiograms (ECG) measuring, for example, heart rate variability. The physical activities and human behaviour may also be used to identify fatigue [4–6]. In this paper yawning, indicating fatigue, is detected and analysed from video sequences. Yawning is an involuntary action where the mouth opens wide and, for this reason, yawning detection research focuses on measuring and classifying this mouth opening. Frequently, however, this approach is thwarted by the common human reaction to hand-cover the mouth during yawning. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to detect yawning by combining mouth opening measurements with a facial distortion (wrinkles) detection method. For mouth opening measurements a new adaptive threshold for segmenting the mouth region is introduced. For yawning detection with the mouth covered, local binary patterns (LBP) features and a learning machine classifier are employed. In order to detect the wrinkles, the edge detector Sobel operator [30] is used. Differently from [32], where the mouth covered detection technique is applied to static images only, the yawn analysis approach proposed in this paper describes a complete system for yawn detection in video sequences. In this research, genuine yawning fatigue video data is used for training, testing and evaluation. The data is from the Strathclyde Facial Fatigue (SFF) video database, which was explicitly created to aid this research, and which contains series of facial videos of sleep deprived fatigued individuals. The, ethically approved, sleep deprivation experiments were conducted at the University of Strathclyde, with the aid of twenty volunteers under controlled conditions. Each of the 20 volunteers was sleep deprived for periods of 0, 3, 5 and 8h on separate occasions. During each session the participants’ faces were recorded while they were carrying out a series of cognitive tasks.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work of this research, while Section 3 explains the SFF database. Section 4 discusses the overall system, while analysis and results are reported in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Conclusions to the paper are provided in Section 7.
