@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The successful application of the real-coded differential evolution (DE) to a wide range of real-valued problems has motivated researchers to investigate its potentiality to integer and discrete valued problems. In most of such works, a real-valued solution is converted into a desired integer-valued solution by applying some posterior decoding mechanisms. Only a limited number of works are found, in which attempts are made for developing an actual integer-coded DE. In this article, such a DE is presented which can work directly with real, integer and discrete variables of a problem without any conversion. In the computational experiments carried out with a set of test problems taken from literature, the DE improved several previously known best solutions, as well as outperformed some similar proposals in most of the cases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Different forms of differential evolution (DE) were proposed by Storn and Price [39,40], which work in a continuous space with real-valued variables of a problem. A DE can efficiently handle a nonlinear and even a non-differentiable objective function, for which the methods of choice are the direct search approaches only. Apart from some classical methods, widely used direct search based stochastic approaches include genetic algorithm [18], evolution strategies [36], and particle swarm optimization [20]. DE is also a direct search based stochastic approach. However, it is claimed that DE converges faster and with more certainty than many other acclaimed global optimization methods [40]. In a very short period of time, DE has become very popular with its successful application to a wide range of design problems, to name a few of such are heat transfer parameter estimation in chemical reactors [3], magnetic bearing design [41], evaluation of robot trajectories [2], unit commitment problem [5], multiprocessor synthesis, neural network learning, crystallographic characterization, synthesis of modulators, scenario-integrated dynamic systems, design of heat exchangers, optimization of chemical processes, optimization of thermal cracker operation, planning of cropping patterns, design of water pumping system, design of gas transmission network, physiochemistry of carbon materials, radio network design, reflectivity curve simulation, and many more [38]. The complete list of applications of the DE is too large to produce here. Interested readers may refer the webpage “Differential Evolution Homepage” on http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html maintained by Rainer Storn, one of the two proposers of the original DE.After its successful application to various real-valued problems, the DE has now drawn the attention of integer/discrete-valued problems too, which encourages to develop some integer-coded versions of DE. In most of such proposals, however, integer/discrete-valued variables are first encoded to real-form and then they are decoded back to their original form after the optimization process through a real-coded DE. Although the implementation of such an approach is very easy and simple, there is a fair possibility of losing many vital information on mapping a discrete space into a continuous space and then mapping it back to the original discrete space. Only a limited number of approaches are found in the specialized literature, in which attempts are made for working directly with integer-valued variables (see Section 2 for detail). Still, the DE has been applied to many integer/discrete valued problems, such as network reconfiguration of distribution systems [42], unit commitment problem [43], load dispatch problem [4], 0–1 knapsack problem [14], optimization of CNC drilling machine operations [28], etc.In this article, a new binary-coded DE is presented, which can directly deal with integer and discrete variables of a problem without any conversion. It is then combined with a real-coded DE for forming a real–integer–discrete-coded DE, named as ridDE, which can work with any type of variables. For improving the performance of the ridDE, some changes are also made to the selection operator of the traditional DE. Moreover, a new diversity generating mechanism is also incorporated for taking away the search from any local optimum. The initial proposal of the ridDE is made elsewhere with its application to two small mechanical design problems [7]. Further, its application to the unit commitment problem is presented in [6,15]. The ridDE is presented here in detail investigating its effectiveness through the application to a set of test problems, involving real, integer and/or discrete variables. In this experiment, the ridDE successfully improves many previously known best solutions. Moreover, the obtained results are statistically compared with some similar approaches, in which the ridDE is found outperforming them in most of the cases, both in solution quality and convergence rate.The rest of the article is organized as follows: the related specialized literature is reviewed in Section 2. The traditional real-coded DE is briefly addressed in Section 3, followed by the presentation of the investigated real–integer–discrete-coded DE in Section 4. The effectiveness of the DE is demonstrated in Section 5 through its application to a set of test problems. Finally, the article is concluded in Section 6 by addressing the present findings as well as the future scope of the work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The success of differential evolution (DE) to different real-valued problem domains has encouraged to develop some integer-coded versions of DE for dealing with integer/discrete-valued problems. In such an attempt, a new version of DE is presented here, named as the ridDE, which can work directly with any type of variables without any conversion. In order to improve the performance of the ridDE, some changes are also made to the selection operator of the traditional DE. Moreover, the ridDE is found suffering from diversity among its solutions, which has been overcome by incorporating an additional diversity generating mechanism. In the computational experiments with a set of 14 test problems, the ridDE successfully improved the previously known best solutions of 6 problems. Comparing with three similar versions of DE and a PSO on multiple runs for each of the considered 14 problems, in most of the problems the ridDE is found more uniform, statistically better in solution quality, as well as faster in convergence rate. Further research may be carried out to exploit the potentialities of the ridDE by applying it to other design problems. Moreover, attempts may also be made for further improvement of its performance.
