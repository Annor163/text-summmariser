@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a two-layer partial composite columns model is built based on Reddy׳s higher order beam theory, and two novel displacement based finite elements for this and Timoshenko composite beams are respectively formulated by means of the principle of minimum potential energy. Subsequently, the buckling analyses of pinned–pinned and clamped–guided composite columns are performed using the proposed finite elements, and the results are compared with those obtained by plane stress model, Timoshenko and Newmark composite beams model respectively. The superior quality of Reddy composite columns model over Timoshenko composite columns model and the correctness of the proposed Timoshenko composite columns model are demonstrated by the numerical comparison. Finally, the parametric study explores effects of parameters including stiffness of shear connectors, span-to-depth ratios, Young׳s modulus ratios and sub-layer׳s depth on the buckling load. The discrepancies between the performance of higher order and Timoshenko composite columns have also been numerically investigated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Composite layered systems are increasingly being employed in various engineering applications due to their optimized material configuration, high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, and so on. For instance, steel-concrete composite beams are designed to make better use of the compressive strength of reinforced concrete slab and the high tensile properties of the steel joist. All the components of two-layer composite beams work together through the connection of shear connectors, thus, the shear connectors play a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of composite beams. Accordingly, models of layered composites, due to the rigidity of the shear connectors, can be grouped into at least three categories: (1) full composite beams model [1], which assumes rigid interfacial connection can be achieved; (2) partial composite beams model [2,3], which takes the interfacial slip into account and is still a popular and reasonable one, though the plane cross-section assumption is still in use; (3) the higher order shear deformable model [4,5], where higher order shear deformation of each sub-layer together with the partial interaction are considered.Mechanical models of two-layer composite beams have been developing. Newmark et al. [6] as one of the pioneers studying the two-layer partial composite beams, formulated the governing differential equations for elastically connected steel-concrete beams, based on the linear elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. Later on, their model was developed for the dynamic and nonlinear problems [7,8]. Ranzi and Zona [3,9] modeled the reinforced concrete slab and steel joist with Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theory (TBT) respectively, and both time-dependent and static analyses were carried out by the finite element method (FEM). Moreover, Ref. [10–13] have proposed or applied mechanical models considering the higher order shear deformation, of which Reddy׳s [11] theory is one of the most popular ones. This theory assumes that the axial displacement of beam varies as cubic polynomial over the beam depth, as a result, the parabolic distribution of shear flow over beam depth can be achieved. Thus, there is no need to introduce the shear corrector factor used by TBT, which is one of the appealing merits. That׳s because it is a tough problem [14] to obtain Timoshenko׳s shear correction factor for composite beams with partial interaction, as the factor is attributed to each component cross-section׳s geometry as well as the shear stress around the section [4]. Recently, Reddy׳s higher order beam theory (RHBT) has been paid close attention to the study of composite beams. Chakrabarti et al. [4,5,15], for example, have proposed the finite elements for two-layer linear elastic partial composite beams, subsequently analyzed both static and dynamic responses of these composite beams by FEM.A considerable amount of research has been conducted on the stability of composite structures. However, most of the literatures on buckling analyses of two-layer composite beams seem to be based on the classic beams theory: Euler–Bernoulli beam theory (EBT) and/or TBT. Even very recently, there are still plenty of reports [16–22] on these. Although there are several reports [4,5,15] aforementioned on RHBT composite beams, most of them are confined to static or dynamic response analyses. To our knowledge, there seems to be no analysis in the open literature for buckling analysis of RHBT partial composite columns, which motivates us to investigate the buckling characteristics of RHBT composite columns and complement the aforementioned studies of Refs. [4,5,15].To overcome the drawbacks about shear correction factor, the present paper performs the buckling analysis of RHBT composite columns, and a novel displacement based locking free finite element is formulated, by means of the principle of minimum potential energy. This finite element (FE), where both Lagrange and Hermite polynomials are employed to construct the shape functions, is composed of three nodes, and each node contains 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), so as to avoid the introduction of penalty coefficient [23], which may cause numerical problem [23]. The reliability and quality of the proposed finite elements are verified through comparisons among the solutions of the present, plain stress model, EBT model, simplified TBT model of Xu and Wu [2] and TBT model of Grognec et al. [18]. In addition, FE formulation for partial TBT composite beams is given to study the discrepancy between TBT and RHBT. And full RHBT composite beams (whose shear connection is rigid) are also presented aiming to make a thorough comparison to examine the shear locking owing to the high stiffness of shear studs. In the parametric study, parameters including slenderness ratios, rigidity of shear connectors, Young׳s modulus ratios and sub-layer depth ratios are investigated.As is shown inFig. 1, coordinate x denotes the location of composite beams’ cross-section; subscript c and s denote the component of layer c and s, respectively. The overall depth of the composite beams is divided by the slip interface and the two x axes at each sub-layer׳s centroid into four, which are h1, h2, h3, and h4 from top to bottom. Symbols uc0 and us0 in Fig. 1 indicate the axial displacement at cross-section׳s centroid of component c and s respectively; θc and θs are the tangent slope of component c and s at centroid of cross-section, respectively. The interfacial slip is noted as ucs. According to Reddy׳s [11] third order axial displacement assumption, the axial displacement mode can be expressed as(1)ui(x,yi)=ui0(x)−θi(x)yi+αi(x)yi2+δi(x)yi3,i=c,s.where uiis the axial displacement of layer i;αi(x)andδi(x)are the coefficients for higher order terms. The process of determiningαi(x)andδi(x)is given below.Neglecting the uplift between the two components, i.e. the transverse displacement of each sub-layer is the same. Thus, the longitudinal interfacial slip ucs and transverse deflection of composite beams w can be written as(2)ucs(x)=uc(x,−h2)−us(x,h3)(3)wc(x)=ws(x)=w(x)Shear strain and stress at cross-section can be obtained using the physical and geometric equations from theory of elasticity [24]. Thus, for part i, shear strainγiand shear stressτican be expressed as(4)γi=∂ui∂yi+w'(5)τi=Giγiwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the x, i.e.(•)'=d(•)/dx; Giis the shear modulus of layer i.Assuming that there is no shear stress acting on the top and bottom surfaces of composite beams, in conjunction with the theorem of conjugate shearing stress, yields two stress boundary conditions(6)τc(h1)=0(7)τs(−h4)=0The above two equations (6) and (7) are the same as Refs. [4,5,15] used, and this paper is going to formulate the other two constraints by the interface force continuity conditons between the two layers, rather than by the way of Refs. [4,5,15] to introduce two adjacent axial displacements at the interface as independent variables.We assume that the shear resistance of shear stud is smeared uniformly on the interface, so that the interface force continuity conditons may be formulated as(8)bcτc(−h2)=kcsucs(9)bsτs(h3)=kcsucswhere the linear constitutive law of shear connectors is employed, i.e. F=kcsucs, in which kcs is rigidity of shear stud; F is the resistance when interfacial slip reaches ucs; bc is the width of cross-section c at the bottom; bs is the width of cross section s on the top.Moreover, the case of rigid shear connection can be formulated by imposing ucs=0, that is(10)uc(−h2)=us(h3)(11)bcτc(−h2)=bsτs(h3)Higher order coefficients αiand δican be obtained by Eqs. (6)–(9) for partial RHBT composite beams, or by Eqs. (6), (7), (10) and (11) for full RHBT composite beams. Consequently, we have the explicit form of axial displacement field as(12)uc=me(13)us=newheree=[uc0θcus0θsw']T; m and n are row vectors whose expressions are given in Appendix A in detail.By using the physical and geometric equations [24], in conjunction with Eqs. (12) and (13), strain vectors can be expressed in terms of e:(14)[εiγi]T=Ti[e'TeT]Twhere εiand γiare normal and shear strains over the cross-section of component i; and matrices Tc and Ts are defined below(15)Tc=[m00∂m∂yc+r](16)Ts=[n00∂n∂ys+r]in whichr=[00001].With the help of the Hook׳s law and Eq. (14), stress vector can also be written in terms of e:(17)[σiτi]T=DiTi[e'TeT]Twhere σi, τi, Eiand Giare normal stress, shear stresses, Young׳s modulus and shear modulus of sub-layer i, respectively, and Dihas the expression as(18)Di=[Ei00Gi]As can be seen inFig. 2(a), a displacement based finite element with three nodes, marked by 1, 2, and 3, is constructed for higher order composite beams, where each node has 6 DOFs: uc0,i, us0,i, θc,i, θs,i,w'iand wi, i=1, 2, 3. And the vector of DOFs for this element is defined as(19)δe=[Ψ1Ψ2Ψ3]Tin which(20)Ψi=[uc0,iθc,iwiwi'us0,iθs,i],i=1,2,3.Similarly, Timoshenko kinematics based composite beams herein are also discussed as a comparison. TBT composite beams finite element, as shown in Fig. 2(b), is with the same node and DOFs configuration as the RHBT ones, except for the DOF ofw'i. Vector of DOFs for TBT composite beams in this study is constructed as(21)δeTimo=[Ψ1TimoΨ2TimoΨ3Timo]TwhereΨiTimo=[uc0,iθc,ius0,iθs,iwi],i=1,2,3.It would be straightforward to formulate the shape functions with mathematical features listed inTable 1, using Lagrange interpolation bases for all the prime variables in Timoshenko and higher order composite beams, except for the field w andw'of higher order composite beams, whose shape functions are obtained by first order Hermite interpolation bases. For uc0, θc, us0 and θs of higher order composite beams, they can be approximated as(22)uc0h=∑i=13Niuc0,i,us0h=∑i=13Nius0,i,θch=∑i=13Niθc,i,θsh=∑i=13Niθs,iwhere shape functions Niare given in Appendix B, and hereafter the apex h denotes the finite element approximation;uc0,i,us0,i,θc,iandθs,idenote the nodal values ofuc0,us0,θcandθs(see Fig. 2).For fields of w andw'in higher order composite beams(23)wh=∑i=13H2i−1wi+∑i=13H2iwi',w'h=∑i=13dH2i−1dxwi+∑i=13dH2idxwi',wherewiandwi'denote the nodal value ofwandw'(see Fig. 2(a)), and Hiis also presented in Appendix B.Combining Eqs. (19), (22) and (23), leads to(24){uc0h=Nuc0δe,θch=Nθcδe,us0h=Nus0δe,θsh=Nθsδeucsh=Nucsδe,wh=Nwδe,w'h=Nw'δe,eh=NeδewhereNeandNucsare given in Appendix B.The shape functions employed in Timoshenko composite beams for the approximation of fields uc0, θc, us0, θs and w is the same as those Lagrange interpolation bases adopted in higher order composite beams. Thus,Nican be re-used for all the displacement fields of Timoshenko composite beams(25)u¯c0h=∑i=13Niuc0,i,u¯s0h=∑i=13Nius0,i,θ¯ch=∑i=13Niθc,i,θ¯sh=∑i=13Niθs,i,w¯h=∑i=13Niwiwhich can be re-written in terms ofδeTimo(26){u¯c0h=N¯uc0δetimo,θ¯ch=N¯θcδetimo,u¯s0h=N¯us0δetimou¯csh=N¯ucsδetimo,θ¯sh=N¯θsδetimo,w¯h=N¯wδetimowhere the superscript short dash in Eqs. (25) and (26) denotes Timoshenko beam theory, andN¯ucsis given as(27)N¯ucs=N¯uc0−N¯us0+h2N¯θc+h3N¯θsBased on the RHBT, the strain energy of deformed isotropic elastic beam occupying a volume V is given as(28)Eε=12∭V∑i=c,s(εiσi+γiτi)dAdxSubstituting Eqs.

(28), yields(29)Eε=12∫0LδeTNETDNEδedxwhereD=∬AcTcTDcTcdAc+∬AsTsTDsTsdAsandNE=[Ne'TNeT]T.The energy stored in the shear connectors, due to the interfacial slip, can be expressed as(30)Ecs=12∫0Lkcsucs2dx=12∫0LδeTNucsTkcsNucsδedxTaking into account the axial displacement due to the second order lateral deformation of composite beams, the extra work done by axial force FN can be written as(31)EG=12∫0LFNw'2dx=12∫0LFNδeTNw'TNw'δedxConsequently, the total potential energy can be obtained as(32)π=Eε+Ecs−EGAccording to the principle of minimum potential energy, the discrete finite element equations can be formulated as(33)∂π∂δe=(Ke+Kcs+KGe)δe=0whereKe+Kcsis the linear elastic stiffness matrix;KGeis the geometric stiffness matrix. They are determined by the following set of expressions(34)Ke=∫0LNETDNEdx(35)Kcs=∫0LNcsTkcsNcsdx(36)KGe=∫0LNw'TFNNw'dxLikewise, by using the same procedure from Eq. (28) to Eq.

(40) and (41) are classic generalized eigenvalue problems, and the minimal eigenvalue is the buckling load Fcr[23,25]. Hereinδandδ¯are also buckling mode vectors.In order to verify the proposed finite elements, two numerical examples have been presented, including comparisons with the work of Xu and Wu [2], Schnabl and Planinc [20] and Grognec et al. [18]. Xu and Wu [2] employed the simplified Timoshenko beam kinematics (assuming that both layers have the same shear strains), and provided analytical buckling solutions for two-layer composite beams. Whereas, Schnabl and Planinc [20] and Grognec et al. [18] obtained the exact buckling solutions for two-layer composite beams with each layer modeled as independent Timoshenko beam. Grognec et al. [18] also presented the approximate EBT based buckling load by amplifying the shear modulus of sub-layer, and they also obtained the results of ABAQUS code, using a 2D plane stress model.The geometric and physical parameters listed inTable 2 and shown inFig. 3 have been adopted by Grognec et al. [18], Xu and Wu [2] and the present study. And all the results are plotted inFig. 4 and tabulated inTable 3, demonstrating the buckling load versus stiffness of shear connectors. There are six groups of data shown in Fig. 4, of which the black asterisk goes very close to the results of Grognec et al. [18]. This good agreement verifies the reliability of the proposed Timoshenko FE formulation and corresponding FE program. From Fig. 4 and Table 3, we can also clearly see that the results of the proposed RHBT composite beams are between those of plane stress and TBT (Grognec et al. [18]) model. This indicates that Timoshenko׳s first order shear deformation hypothesis is refined by the higher order terms introduced by RHBT. The relative errors shown in Table 3 suggest that shear effect shall not be neglected especially when shear connectors are relatively stiff, as can be seen in the figure that the maximum error of EBT composite beams reaches 42.56%, whereas the maximum relative error of RHBT composite beams is only 3.424%, and TBT composite beams are with the accuracy next to RHBT ones.These results may be accounted by three reasons. First, the only source of shear deformation is the shear connector due to the clamped–guided boundary conditions, thus the shear effects tend to intensify with the growth of the rigidity of the shear connectors. That is the reason why the relative error of EBT composite beams to plane stress model increases as the shear connectors stiffen. Second, it may be not precise enough to keep the shear stress correction factor constant as the shear stress adjacent to the interface is relevant to the rigidity of shear connectors, instead of always being zero. As a result, the correction factor may become more unreliable with the growth of interfacial stiffness. Third, although the Timoshenko kinematics has been refined by RHBT, the rest part of the exact axial displacement starts to influence significantly with the increase of the interfacial rigidity, consequently, as we can see, the relative error of RHBT to plane stress model grows.In this section, T-shaped composite beams with pinned–pinned boundary conditions are demonstrated by the results of Xu and Wu [2], Schnabl and Planinc [20], Grognec et al. [18] and the present. Structural parameters and boundary conditions for this section are given inFig. 5, and the results are tabulated inTable 4, which gives the buckling load versus rigidity of shear connectors. This table indicates that the results of RHBT and TBT are quite close to each other as they are very slender (with slenderness ratio L/(hc+hs)=20), though the results of RHBT are a little smaller than those of TBT. Besides, the results of Ref. [18], [20] and the present study are roughly the same. However, the simplification of shear strain imposed by Xu and Wu [2] seems to affect the stability characteristic rather significantly, especially when connectors are very stiff. Similar to the case of clamped–guided composite beams, we can see that the rigidity of the shear connectors also influences much on the shear effect of pinned–pinned composite beams.In this section, the performance of the proposed finite elements on slip locking [26] are examined, by comparing the results of the proposed partial RHBT composite beams with full RHBT composite beams. Material and geometric parameters (see Fig. 5(a)) and boundary conditions (see Fig. 5(b)) are the same as those used in Section 4.1.2, except for the beam span.Table 5 examines the buckling load of the pinned–pinned slender composite beams with stiffness of the shear connectors ranging from relatively small to large, so as to compare with the model neglecting the interfacial slip. This table shows that the buckling loads of the partial RHBT models converge to those of full RHBT ones as the stiffness of shear connectors increase, without any oscillation that may manifest in the slip locking problems. And Table 5 also demonstrates that the buckling load converges fast and stably with the increase of the finite element number, indicating the reliability of the proposed RHBT FE formulation and program developed.Further on,Fig. 6 illustrates the first four orders of buckling loads versus the elements number used per span, and results for only half span are plotted due to the symmetry or anti-symmetry of the results. In Fig. 6, solid lines represent the results obtained by the FE program using Eq. (A.6), which neglects the interfacial slip, and 50 elements are used in the meshing. Other curves and scatters are obtained by RHBT composite beams considering the interfacial slip, i.e. Eq. (A.3) is used in the program, though the shear connectors are very stiff (kcs/Gs=1010). Fig. 6(a) also manifests that the partial RHBT model with stiff shear connectors converges to the full composite beams model so fast that even the model meshed by single one element can achieve such good approximation for the first two order modes. Likewise, as shown in Fig. 6(b), within no more than four finite elements per span the partial RHBT finite element model can achieve decent approximation to the full RHBT model, and apparently there is no sign of slip locking. Table 6 andFig. 7, as a supplementation to Table 5 and Fig. 6, focus on the convergence performance of deep composite beams, and the same features can be seen as Table 5 and Fig. 6 manifest.With the aim of investigating the influences of beam׳s ratio of span-to-depth, stiffness of the connectors and shear flexibility of the sub-layer on the stability characteristic,Fig. 8 illustrates the shear effects of ratio of span-to-depth r and α, where r=L/(2hs) and α=kcs/Gs, setting the cross-section and material properties of the two layers to be the same as the component s given in Table 2. In order to study the feasibility of full composite beams theory [1] and Newmark׳s partial shear interaction composite beams model [6], dimensionless buckling load β1 and β2 are introduced in Fig. 8, as follows(42)β1=FcrHBTFcrEBT1,β2=FcrHBTFcrEBT2,whereFcrHBTis the buckling load obtained by the FE program based on the presented RHBT composite beams;FcrEBT1is the buckling load computed by full composite beams theory [1], which ignores the interfacial slip and the shear flexibility of each sub-layer, and is approximately obtained through amplifying the shear modulus and stiffness of shear connectors by relatively large times to the original value;FcrEBT2is the buckling load based on Newmark model [6], where interfacial interaction has been taken into account, but the shear strain of each sub-layer is neglected.Fig. 8 clearly shows that β1 and β2 are approaching to 1 with the increase of r, which indicates that the shear effects are getting weaker as the composite beams are getting slender. However, the accuracy of full composite beams declines rapidly with the decrease of α ( especially when α<2) even the composite beams are very slender, as a result of the assumption of rigid interfacial connection. Moreover, in the case when kcs is very stiff (taking α=4 for example) so that effects of interfacial slip may be approximately neglected, the accuracy of TBT composite beams model is much higher than full composite beam model, for example when r decreases from 14 to 2, ratio of β1/β2 decreases from 0.984 to 0.622, because of the shear flexibility of sub-layer.Fig. 9 is focused on the difference between the TBT and the RHBT composite beams, trying to illustrate the effects of higher order shear deformation on the stability characteristic. The parameters used in this figure are the same as those of Fig. 8. This figure clearly shows that the buckling loads based on TBT are to diverge from those based on RHBT significantly as the composite beams become deeper (i.e. with the decrease of r ) and this also manifests that the effects of higher order terms are enhanced with the decrease of r. Moreover, the discrepancy of buckling loads is to decline with the decrease of kcs/Gs and vanish when kcs decrease to be zero (i.e. the shear stress around cross-section of each sub-layer turns to be zero), which indicates that the shear stress around the edge of each sub-layer cross-section will affect the value of shear correction factor, and the factor of 5/6 adopted in this TBT composite beams is the value suitable best for the beam with free shear stress along the edge of cross section.Fig. 10 is devoted to study the influences of Young׳s modulus and cross-section configuration of the composite on the stability characteristic. Herein we introduce two parameters nE and nhc to depict the configuration, and they are defined as(43)nE=EcEs,nhc=hchs+hcwhere the span of composite beams L=1m; slenderness ratio r=4; composite beams’ entire depth is hc+hs=0.25m. In Fig. 10(a) the influence of nEc has been investigated, where the Young׳s modulus of component s is Es=2×1011Pa, and nhc=0.5. This figure represents the buckling loads based on Newmark׳s model as “EBT”, Timoshenko beam theory as “TBT” and “RHBT” standing for the curves computed by Reddy׳s higher order beam theory, and it can be clearly seen that the discrepancies among the three theories are growing with the increase of nE, which implies that the shear effects will be enhanced when the shear modulus of the component c approaches to the relative stiff material component s. Moreover, it can be drawn that shear effects are declining as the stiffness of shear connectors decrease, and finally vanishes when kcs decreases to zero, because in this state there is no shear stress over the cross-section owing to the boundary condition shown in Fig. 3. On the other hand, this figure verifies that the Timoshenko model due to the first order deformation hypothesis makes it quite decent a model compared with Newmark׳s model.Further on, Fig. 10(b) where the Young׳s modulus of component c is Ec= 5×109Pa, aims at discussing the effects of cross-section׳s geometric configuration on the stability characteristic, and it reveals that the interval where kcs dominates is very narrow in the vicinity of zero. What really plays a pivotal role is the nhc and the buckling loads based on the three theories diverge as nhc decreases from 0.99 to 0.1, which also manifests that the accuracy of TBT may be reduced, compared with RHBT, when nhc is relatively small, herein for example nhc=0.1, the deviations of TBT and EBT from RHBT are almost the same, whereas the TBT solutions are quite close to those of RHBT when nhc=0.99.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a new type of displacement based finite element composed of three nodes and 18 DOFs is formulated, using Reddy׳s higher order beam theory. Meanwhile, a by-product of displacement based finite element, with three nodes and 15 DOFs, for Timoshenko composite beams is also formulated, and FE programs using these two types of elements are developed. Buckling analysis of composite beams with clamped–guided and pinned–pinned boundary conditions is performed by the proposed FE programs. The presented finite element formulation and programs are verified by comparison with the results of Xu and Wu [2], Schnabl and Planinc [20] and Grognec et al. [18]. Numerical comparison shows that the presented RHBT composite beams model is closer to the 2D plane stress model than the TBT ones behave, which demonstrates the superiority of RHBT composite beams model over TBT ones. Furthermore, the solutions of the presented TBT composite beams have a good agreement with those of Schnabl and Planinc [20] and Grognec et al. [18], which demonstrates the reliability and correctness of the presented finite formulation and program based on TBT. Slip locking test apparently shows that the proposed RHBT composite beams element is locking free.Finally, the parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effects of slenderness ratio r, ratio of kcs-to-Gs and the cross-section configuration on the stability characteristic, and the following main conclusions can be drawn:(1)The full composite beams’ kinematics shall be avoided in the design when the value of kcs is small compared with Gs, for example kcs/Gs<0.1 in Fig. 8(a), even the beam is very slender. Newmark׳s model has been improved much compared with full composite beams’ hypothesis, and its shear effect of each sub-layer decreases rapidly with the increase of r, when for instance, r>6 in Fig. 8(b), thus, it may be suitable to employ Newmark׳s model in this case.Buckling loads of Timoshenko composite beams diverge from those based on RHBT when composite beams are thick and α is large, for example α>1 and r<3, in Fig. 9.The divergence of buckling loads obtained by the three theories will become larger with the increase of nE or decrease of nhc.(A.1)[αcδcαsδs]=[A1eA2eA3eA4e]wheree=[uc0θcus0θsw']T, and matrix A is composed of four row vectors A1, A2, A3 and A4, that is(A.2)A=[A1TA2TA3TA4T]TAnd for partial RHBT composite beams, matrix A can be expressed as(A.3)A=S1−1S2(A.4)S1=[2Gch13Gch120000−2Gsh43Gsh42−h2(2bcGc+h2kcs)bch22(3Gc+h2kcsbc)h32kcsbch33kcsbc−h22kcsbsh23kcsbsh3(2Gs+h3kcsbs)h32(3Gs+h3kcsbs)](A.5)S2=[0Gc00−Gc000Gs−GskcsbcGc+h2kcsbc−kcsbch3kcsbc−Gckcsbsh2kcsbs−kcsbsGs+h3kcsbs−Gs]For RHBT composite beams with rigid shear studs, matrix A can be rewritten as(A.6)A=S˜1−1S˜2(A.7)S˜1=[2Gch13Gch120000−2Gsh43Gsh42h22−h23−h32−h332bcGch2−3bcGch222bsGsh33bsGsh32](A.8)S˜2=[0Gc00−Gc000Gs−Gs−1−h21−h300−bcGc0bsGsbcGc−bsGs]As a result, the explicit expressions for axial displacement can be determined as(A.9){m=Yc+yc2A1+yc3A2n=Ys+ys2A3+ys3A4where, Yc, Ys andAi(i=1,2,3,4) are row vectors with length of 5;Yc=[1−yc000], andYs=[001−ys0].
