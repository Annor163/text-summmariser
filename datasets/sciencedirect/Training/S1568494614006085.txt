@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) approach based on Taylor series expansion (TSE) technique for space-time code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems. It has been shown that the TSE of the presumed steering vector is a simple approach without any need for direction search. Unfortunately, the Taylor approach is more likely to converge to a local maximum, causing errors in DOA estimation. In conjunction with a genetic algorithm for selecting initial search angle, an efficient approach is presented to achieve the advantages of TSE DOA estimation with fast convergence and less computational load over iterative searching MVDR estimator. Simulation results are provided for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques have been considered as attractive multiple access schemes in both second-generation and third-generation wireless systems and attracted increasing attention recently in wireless applications for efficient use of available bandwidth, resistance to interference, and adaptability to variable traffic pattern. In CDMA systems, several independent users are simultaneously active in the same transmission medium and distinguishable at multiuser detectors by different user-specific code sequences [1]. Due to the imperfect orthogonality among the different code sequences, multiple-access interference (MAI) is a major limitation to the system capacity. Many advanced adaptive array techniques have been proposed to combat interference for enhancing the performance of CDMA systems [2]. They can provide accurate localization of user terminals, which are of interest in advanced handover schemes, public safety services, and intelligent transportation systems. In all these applications, estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the desired user is required [3]. Array outputs aligned with code-matched filter can make the multiple sources DOA estimation equivalent to that of a single source localization problem in a noisy environment. But for the conventional spectral searching minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) estimator [4], its searching complexity and estimating accuracy strictly depend on the number of search grids used during the search. Thus, it involves a great computation burden when a fine grid search in the angle range is performed. That is time consuming and the required number of search grid is not clear to determine. In addition, a high-efficiency method was proposed by [5], which used polynomial roots to set up the search. However, the accuracy of this method will be low in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and MAIs. Thus, an improper root selection often results in severe bias in the signals’ parameter estimation. For the purpose of efficient DOA estimation, a simple and yet effective method [6] had been proposed that is implemented on iterative search rather than spectral searching. The basic idea is based on the first-order Taylor series approximation to the spatial scanning vector in terms of estimating deviation results in and reduces to a simple one-dimensional MVDR optimization problem, which is referred to as an iterative MVDR (IMVDR) estimator. This approach can reduce the required search grids for DOA estimation than the conventional spectral search method. But, it is still computationally expensive for an accurate direction as the iteration is required. This prompts development of space-time MVDR techniques based on DOA estimation algorithms which can achieve a better performance for a single signal source. However, it also contributes to solve the limitation that the number of array elements must be more than the number of impinging signal sources.The genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most powerful optimization algorithms, which is based on the evolution of nature with the principle of diversity and competition. It is used for the DOA estimation of several narrowband signals impinging on an antenna array, due to their robustness and efficiency in problems where optimal solution should be searched in a vast search space [7]. GA applies operators inspired by the mechanics of natural selection to the population of binary strings that encode the parameter space [8,9]. Since the GA is able to explore several points in the search space simultaneously, thereby reducing the chance of convergence to local optima. It is able to recombine structural information to locate new points in the search space with expected improved performance. In particular, it does not need to assume a differentiable or continuous search space, and can also iterate several times on each datum received. A typical GA approach [10] solves the exact maximization likelihood equation arising in a signal processing problem. This approach can keep the risk of false DOA estimate low, at the expense of a significant increase in the computational burden that may not be always acceptable [11]. Recently, a combining GA with the IMVDR based on iterative searching technique has been proposed to achieve the advantages of iterative DOA estimate and also conquer the local minimum searching problem, which is referred to as a GA/IMVDR estimator [12]. However, the GA/IMVDR algorithm is computationally expensive as the iteration is required and it does not still show the superior performance for a wide range of pointing errors. In this paper, we present the space-time DOA estimation approach based on the Taylor series expansion (TSE) of the presumed steering vector, which is robust to pointing errors. First, a GA-based estimator is developed in order to deal with the selecting initial search angle for the TSE DOA technique. Secondly, utilizing the Taylor series approximation to the space-time vector to find a new steering vector and formulate as the closed form of a generalized eigenvalue problem, which allows one to readily solve it [13]. Applied to the MVDR algorithm and forms the TSE MVDR (TMVDR) estimator. In natural, this TMVDR technique can find a new steering vector based on the TSE of the one initially given. However, it also suffers from the local minimum problem when the assumed initial angles are near to the interferers’ DOAs, especially the processing gain is not sufficiently large. Finally, in conjunction with a GA-based estimator for selecting initial search angle, this paper presents an efficient space-time MVDR approach to achieve the advantages of TSE DOA estimate with fast convergence and less computational load over existing conventional spectral and iterative searching methods. The resultant approach is referred to as a GA/TMVDR estimator which starts the search procedure as a pure-GA and ends as a pure TMVDR. The transition from GA to TMVDR occurs when the fittest individual remains the same for N generations [14]. Simulation results show that the proposed GA/TMVDR estimator is very suitable to treat the DOA estimation under space-time systems.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines the problem formulation. In Section 3, the GA-based, TMVDR and GA/TMVDR estimators are presented for DOA estimation. Simulation results are presented in Section 4, and a conclusion is given in Section 5.Consider a DOA scenario in a baseband synchronous CDMA system with P simultaneous users. Let the bit duration Tbbe equal to the processing gain L times the chip duration Tc. Let am(θ)=exp[−j2πd(m−1)sinθ/β] denote the response of the mth sensor array to a signal with unit amplitude arriving from the direction angle θ, wherej=−1and β is the wavelength of the signal carrier. After demodulating and chip sampling, the received signal vector across a uniform linear array (ULA) with M elements and element spacing d at the kth bit interval can be represented as:(1)X(k)=∑p=1Pa(θp)rp(k)cpT+N(k),where X(k) is a M×L matrix, rp(k)=epbp(k), epis the received signal amplitude of the pth user, and bp(k)∈{−1, 1} is the kth data bit of the pth user spreaded by a pseudo-noise (PN) codeword cp. a(θp)=[a1(θp), a2(θp), …, aM(θp)]Tis the response vector of the pth user signal with direction angle θpand T is transpose of a vector. N(k) is the spatially and temporally white complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and varianceσn2. For convenience, we will assume that p is the first user of interest. After passing through the code-matched filter, the despreaded signal at the kth bit interval is given by(2)y(k)=X(k)c1=Lr1(k)a1+∑p=2Prp(k)qp1ap+n1(k)=Lr1(k)a1+MAI+n1(k),whereqp1=cpTc1and n1(k)=N(k)c1. The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) can be view as the MAI. Thus, the second term can be included into the noise term, and the composite vector is replaced by a new nomenclature asn′1(k)with zero mean and varianceσn′12. Then, (2) can be rewritten asy(k)=Lr1(k)a1+n′1(k).The ensemble correlation matrix of y(k) is obtained by(3)R=E{y(k)yH(k)}=L2e12a1a1H+σn′12IM,where E{·} and the superscript H denote the expectation and complex conjugate transpose, respectively. IMis the identity matrix with size M×M. For finite received signal's samples, the received signal correlation matrix R is replaced by the estimated samples averageRˆ=(1/N)∑k=1Ny(k)yH(k)and N is the total bits of observation.The conventional MVDR [4] is an attempt to overcome the poor resolution problem associated with the Fourier method and it results a significant improvement. In this estimator, the output power is minimized with the constraint that the gain in the desired direction remains unity. The MVDR estimator estimates the DOA of the desired user based on the highest peak of the following spectrum:(4)S(θ)=maxθ1|aH(θ)R−1a(θ)|,where a(θ)=[a1(θ), a2(θ), …, aM(θ)]Tis the spatial scanning vector and θ∈[−90°, 90°] varies within the whole searching space. From (4), we can redefine a new cost function with the searching grid μ1 as(5)J(θ)=minθ|aH(θ)R−1a(θ)|,which can be viewed as the null spectrum of MVDR. As a consequence, finding the maximum (or peaks) of S(θ) is equivalent to find the minimum (or nulls) of J(θ). In this paper, due to the number of users often exceeds the number of antenna elements, which the effect of MAIs will increase rapidly in such a situation. Under the situation, the DOA estimation has many local solutions, and the complexity increases. The spatial spectrum of the MVDR is shown in Fig. 1. However, for the conventional MVDR estimator, its searching complexity and estimating accuracy strictly depend on the number of search grids used during the search.The performance of the abovementioned spectral searching MVDR estimator is governed by the scanning grid size and the number of search grids while implementing the high-resolution DOA estimation. It is time consuming and the search grid is not clear. In [6], to cure such a problem, an IMVDR estimating technique is presented with adaptive search grid at each iteration by maximizing the MVDR spectrum with respect to the DOA estimating deviation. A first-order Taylor series approximation to the space-time scanning vector in terms of the estimating deviation results in and reduces to a simple one-dimensional optimization problem. The correcting factor is self-tuned and fast adaptively corrected from the iteration previous stage in spite of how well the initial guess is performed. From (5), it is noted that the DOA estimation attempts to determine the minimum of the cost function. In a small region Δθ about the assumed initial angle-of-arrival θ0, a(θ) can be approximated by a first order Taylor series(6)a(θ)=a(θ0+Δθ)≅a(θ0)+Δθa′(θ0),wherea′(θ0)=(d/dθ)a(θ)|θ=θ0. Substituting (6) into (5) results in(7)minΔθ[a(θ0)+Δθa′(θ0)]HR−1[a(θ0)+Δθa′(θ0)].This is a simple one-dimensional optimization problem. Then, it can be easily shown that the optimum Δθ is given by(8)Δθ=−Re[aH(θ0)R−1a′(θ0)][a′(θ0)]HR−1a′(θ0),where Re[·] denotes the real part of the complex quantity. The optimum space-time response vector can then be found by substituting (8) into (6). If the estimating deviation Δθ is very small, the space-time response vector obtained from (8) is equivalent to the real response vector with actual user signal's DOA. However, if the estimating deviation is quite large, then we require an iterative algorithm that updates the estimating deviation toward to the actual value. Let μ2 is a terminating error value. If the estimating deviation |Δθ|≤μ2, we think Δθ is small enough, and the iteration processing is end, θ is the expected value. In addition, if the initial angle θ0 is far the real direction angle θ1, it is very difficult to find the overall optimized solution. However, the IMVDR requires more iteration for large pointing errors. A sound θ0 is required and μ2 can be set to a desired precision. The proposed IMVDR estimator is formed as following steps.(A)Given the received data y(k), μ2, and initialθ0=θˆ1.Evaluate the Δθ from (8).If Δθ>μ2, then renew the θ0=θ0+Δθ and repeat the procedure from step (B) to step (C) until Δθ≤μ2, the suitable θ0 is obtained.Theoretically, this iterative technique can speed up the searching rate in comparison with the MVDR estimator. But, it is computationally expansive as the iteration is required.GA is inspired by the mechanism of natural selection where stronger individuals are more likely to be the winner in a competing environment and GA uses a direct analogy of such natural evolution. It is an iterative procedure which maintains a constant size population D of candidate solutions. In each generation, the GA is composed of three operators: selection, crossover, and mutation. These operators are implemented by performing the basic tasks of coping strings, exchanging portion of strings, and changing the state of bit from 1′s to 0′s. The solutions are selected according to their fitness, in order to contribute to the next generation. Relatively fitter individuals will survive, and unfit individuals will be discarded. That is to improve the performance of the next generation. It is shown in schema theorem [8] that the genetic search algorithm will converge exponentially from the view point of schema. With the above descriptions, we provide the explanation of the GA for estimating the DOA of desired user. First, binary coding is used in this paper for simplicity and convenience [15]. Based on binary coding method, the parameter θ of the spectrum cost function in (4) has its own lower bound −90, upper bound 90, and parameter resolution r. Then the string length l is related by2l≥(180/r)+1, where the symbolxrepresents the maximum integer not exceeding x. Next, for the GA-based DOA estimator, the cost function is defined as C(θ)=S(θ) which is based on MVDR criterion. Our objective is to search θ to achieve the maximum of (4). Then the cost function C(θ) takes a chromosome and returns a value. The value of the cost is then mapped into a fitness value S(θ) so as to fit into the GA. The fitness value is a reward based on the performance of the possible solution represented by the string, or it can be thought of as how well a signal direction angle θ can be tuned according to the string to actually maximum the cost function. The better the solution encoded by a string (chromosome), the higher the fitness. To maximum C(θ) is equivalent to getting a maximum fitness value in genetic searching process, a chromosome that has a higher C(θ) should be assigned a larger fitness value. Then, GA tries to generate better offsprings to improve the fitness. Therefore, the objective function in (4) has to be changed to the maximization of fitness to be used in the simulated roulette wheel in our GA. When a good offspring is generated, they wait for the action of the other two operators, crossover and mutation. Here, crossover provides a mechanism for strings to mix and match desirable qualities through a random process. In order to preserve some good strings selected during the selection operator, not all strings in the population are used in crossover. In our GA, the classic 1-point crossover is used and the probability of crossover pcis performed. When combined with selection, crossover is an effective means of exchanging information and combining various elements high-quality solutions.Selection and crossover yield the bulk of the processing power of GAs. However, mutation is another important reproduction operation, which improves the global search. Usually, as the population converges, mutation is more effective than crossover. Mutation operator changes a 1 to a 0 and vice versa with a small mutation probability pm. The need for mutation is to keep diversity in the population. Mutation should be used sparingly, as it is a random search operator and, at high mutation rates, the algorithm degrades to a random search.In this subsection, we proposed a based on TSE approach, which only requires one to readily solve it. Consider an array vector a(θ), which is assumed to be infinitely differentiable in the neighborhoods ofa(θˆ). It can be represented through the Taylor series expansion ata(θˆ)as(9)a(θ)=∑k=0∞ck(θ)a(k)(θˆ),whereck(θ)=(θ−θˆ)k/k!. Using the first k terms of the series, the true steering vector a(θ) may be approximated as(10)a(θ)≅∑k=0K−1ck(θ)a(k)(θˆ)=Bc,where c=[c0(θ), c1(θ), …, cK−1(θ)]TandB=[a(θˆ),a(1)(θˆ),…,a(K−1)(θˆ)]. Asθˆapproaches θ the approximation error ||Bc−a(θ)|| tends to zero where ||·|| denotes the Euclidean norm. When|θ−θˆ|is small, Bc with K≥2 would be closer to a(θ) thanaθˆ, which is identical to Bc with K=1. Therefore, it is expected that better performance would be obtained if Bc could be used in place ofa(θˆ). However, the vector c is unknown, though the matrix B is known. Based on the approximation (10), we will find a new steering vector with the form Bu where u is a K-dimensional vector and K<M. When using Bu as the steering vector, the output power of the desired user is given by(11)Pow=(uHBHR−1Bu)−1The vector u is selected such that the array output power is maximized under the unit norm constraint on Bu:(12)minuuHBHR−1Busubject to||Bu||2=1Introducing the Lagrange multiplier method, (12) is transformed into the unconstrained minimization as(13)minuf(γ,u),where f(γ, u)=uHBHR−1Bu+γ(1−uHBHBu) and γ is the Lagrange multiplier. Taking the derivative of f(γ, u) with respect to u and setting it to zero, we have(14)BHR−1Bu=γBHBu.Recalling that ||Bu||2=1 and substituting (14) into (11), it follows thatPow=γ−1. Hence, the solution u to (14) corresponds to the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem (14). The new steering vectorv¯is then given byv¯=Bu.To make the first entry equal to one for the actual steering vector, we define a vector shown asv=(v1)−1v¯, wherev1denotes the first entry ofv¯. Since the amplitude of each entry of the actual steering vector is equal to one, an appropriate estimate of the actual steering vector can then be obtained from v by finding the optimal solution for the following optimization problem [16](15)Minimize||vˆ−v||2subject tovˆ1=1and|vˆm|=1,m>1wherevˆmdenotes the mth entry ofvˆ. After some algebraic manipulations, we can show that (15) is equivalent to the following optimization problem(16)MaximizeRe{vˆHv}subjecttovˆ1=1and|vˆm|=1,m>1where Re{x} denotes the real part of x. The optimization problem formulated in (16) has a closed-form solution given byaˆwith its mth entryaˆmsatisfying(17)aˆm=vm|vm|m=1,2,…,MThus, the estimated ideal steering vector isaˆ. After obtaining the shaped steering vectoraˆ, we compute the corresponding incident directional angle of the desired signal. Based on the concept of constructing steering vector, we present a method for finding the incident directional angle of desired signal, which was shown as follows:(18)θˆ=1M−1∑m=2Mtan−1(Im{aˆm}/Re{aˆm})(m−1)2πwhere Im{x} denotes the complex part of x.Finally, based on the above stated estimation scheme, the steps for implementing the proposed estimator is described in the list that follows.(A)Obtain the sample correlation matrix R of (3) and set the initial estimatesθˆfor desired user.CalculateB=[a(θˆ),a(1)(θˆ),…,a(K−1)(θˆ)].Perform the generalized eigenvalue decomposition on (14) to obtain the eigenvector u which corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue. Then, the new steering vectorv¯is then given byv¯=Bu.To make the first entry equal to one for the actual steering vector, we define a vector asv=(v1)−1v¯, wherev1denotes the first entry ofv¯.Update (17) to obtainaˆwith its mth entryaˆm=vm|vm|.Obtainθˆfrom (18) as follows:θˆ=1M−1∑m=2Mtan−1(Im{aˆm}/Re{aˆm})(m−1)2π.The DOA estimation of the proposed TSE for the desired user isθˆ.The TMVDR estimation is based on the TSE technique and gives a more precise model than the IMVDR estimator. But, it also suffers from the local minimum problem when the assumed initial angles are near to the interferers’ DOAs, especially the processing gain is not sufficiently large.The basic idea of the GA/TMVDR estimator is to combine the GA-based estimator and the TMVDR estimator to reduce the local minimum problem due to the TMVDR estimator with an unsuitable initial search angle. The combining GA/TMVDR estimator always starts the search procedure as a pure-GA and ends as a pure-TMVDR. The transition from GA to TMVDR occurs when the following condition is satisfied. The fittest individual remains the same for N generations. This condition is satisfied whenever the algorithm converges to an intermediate solution. The solution thus far constitutes a good initial guess to the TMVDR estimator.Based on the above analysis, the flowchart of the proposed GA/TMVDR estimator is presented in Fig. 2. Again, the design procedure of GA/TMVDR direction angle θ estimation is divided into the following steps.(A)Given the received data vector y(k), and generate a random population θ of D chromosomes.Compute the corresponding fitness value from (4).Use the GA operators (selection, crossover, and mutation) to produce chromosomes of next generation.Repeat the procedure from step (B) to step (D) until the fittest individual remains the same after N generations.Given the best chromosome, θ are the initial values of TMVDR.CalculateB=[a(θˆ),a(1)(θˆ),…,a(K−1)(θˆ)].Perform the generalized eigenvalue decomposition on (14) to obtain the eigenvector u which corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue. Then, the new steering vectorv¯is then given byv¯=Bu.To make the first entry equal to one for the actual steering vector, we define a vector asv=(v1)−1v¯, wherev1denotes the first entry ofv¯.Update (17) to obtainaˆwith its mth entryaˆm=vm|vm|.Obtainθˆfrom (18) as follows:θˆ=1M−1∑m=2Mtan−1(Im{aˆm}/Re{aˆm})(m−1)2π.The DOA estimation of the proposed TSE for the desired user isθˆ.In general, S(θ) is a very highly nonlinear function of the probability θ. There are may exist many local maximum. It is very difficult to find the global maximum of S(θ) in (4) by using the gradient searching methods. GA is one of the most powerful optimization algorithms, which is initially inspired from the processes of natural selection and evolution genetics. The GA-based estimator exhibits fast initial convergence, but its performance deteriorates as it approaches the desired global extreme. Interestingly, the TMVDR estimator shows a complementary convergence pattern, in addition to high accuracy. Therefore, in this study, combining GA and TMVDR will be employed to estimate the signal direction angle θ in (4) to achieve weak dependence on initial angles, fast convergence, and high accuracy.In this subsection, the number of complex multiplications (CM), searching-based MVDR, subspace approach multiple signal classification (MUSIC) [19], GA-based, GA/IMVDR, and GA/TMVDR are evaluated. Briefly, the required CMs are listed in Table 1. The averaged numbers of searching are defined asFi=(1/Π)∑ρ=1ΠFiρfor i=1, 2,3, where Π indicates the independent simulation runs Assume the number of array elements is M. All MVDR-based estimators in Table 1 include the matrix inverse step, R−1, which is about 2M3 CM. Let the search number is F1 for MVDR. Performing R−1 is required about 2M3 CM. The multiplication of aH(θ)R−1 and aH(θ)R−1a(θ) needs M2 and M CMs. Therefore, the total required CM for performing MVDR estimation with the cost function S(θ) is about 2M3+F1(M2+M) CM. The computational complexity of the classical MUSIC is about 12M3 CM for computing EVD of a M×M dimension matrix. PerformingEnEnHis required about M2(M−1) CM, where Enis noise subspace. The multiplication ofaH(θ)EnEnHandaH(θ)EnEnHa(θ)needs M2 and M CMs. The total required CM for performing MUSIC estimation is about 13M3−M2+F1(M2+M) CM. On the other hand, let the iteration number is F2 for the IMVDR. For computing Δθ in (8), R−1a(1)(θ) requires M2 CM, then both aH(θ)R−1a(1)(θ) and a(1)(θ)R−1a(1)(θ) are M CM. Therefore, the total CM of the IMVDR is about 2M3+F2(M2+2M) CM. It is noted that the larger DOA error requires the more search number for IMVDR. Let the iteration number is F3 for the TMVDR. The multiplication of BHB is MK2, and the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) of (14) requires 12K3 CM, and Bu required MK CM, where K is the selected order of Taylor series expansion. The total required CM of the TMVDR is 2M3+F3(MK2+12K3+MK) CM. For the GA-based estimator, the computational complexity is related with the size of population D and the maximum number of generation N, which is about DN for performing MVDR estimation with the cost function. Then, the total CM of the GA is about 2M3+DN(M2+M) CM. Finally, the total required CM of the GA/IMVDR and GA/TMVDR is 2M3+DN(M2+M)+F2(M2+2M) and 2M3+DN(M2+M)+F3(MK2+12K3+MK) CM. However, a proper initial DOA is estimated using GA estimator with smaller the population size and generations for the proposed GA/TMVDR. Then, the proposed GA has smaller DN to perform a rough estimate, which is fed into the TMVDR, so it reduces the generation number of F3. Simultaneously, the proposed TMVDR with smaller K=2 is used.For illustrating the performance of the proposed GA/TMVDR estimator, several simulations examples are conducted. For comparison, we also include MUSIC, MVDR, GA-based estimator, GA/IMVDR, GA/TMVDR, and TMVDR estimator with different initial angles. Assume that the user of interest is p=1 for convenience. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is defined asRMSEθ˜1=(1/Π)∑j=1Π(θˆ1,j−θ1)20.5, whereθˆ1,jis the estimate angle of the first user at the jth independent run. All CDMA signals were generated with BPSK modulation and PN codes of processing gain 31. The additive background noise is assumed to be spatially and temporally white complex Gaussian distribution with zero-mean and unit variance. For MVDR, the searching grid was μ1=0.001° under the search range of [−90°, 90°]. The terminating error values were μ2=10−3 and μ2=10−4 for the performance evaluation of the IMVDR, because the number of iterations for convergence depends on the choice of the threshold which has strict requirement. The parameters of the GA-based estimator were set as pc=0.8, pm=0.1, and l=18 [17,18]. Here, two different parameters of the GA were used, being D=50, N=20 and D=50, N=50, where D is the population size and N is the number of generations. The estimate results are obtained after 200 data bits were processed and it was averaged by 200 independent Monte Carlo runs with independent noise samples for each run.Example 1: The example investigates the case of P<M. Consider active CDMA signals P=4 and an 8-element ULA with half-wavelength. The impinging angles of all three interferers with equal power interference–tonoise ratio (INR)=10dB are [−12°, 17°, 33°]. The desired user is impinging on the array with directional angle of θ1=0∘. Table 2gives the RMSE and the search number of the method proposed in this paper with that of other methods. The traditional MUSIC and MVDR perform searches over the full search space, and its search times are directly affected by the size of the searching grid μ1. Thus, the searching grid was μ1=0.001° under the search range of [−90°, 90°], and the number of searches was F1=180, 001 for the MUSIC and MVDR. For the GA-based estimator, the population size was D=50, and the number of generations was N=20 and N=50. Therefore, the number of searches was 1000 and 2500. In addition, the performance of the IMVDR heavily depends on the selected terminating error value μ2, that a small terminating error value has better estimation resolution. The average number of generations was about N=19 for GA/IMVDR. However, the terminating error values of the GA/IMVDR were μ2=10−3 and μ2=10−4, and the average number of iterations were F2=120 and F2=205, respectively. Finally, the population size was D=50, and the average number of generations was N=10 for the proposed method. From Table 2, it is clear that the searching number of TMVDR estimator is smaller than that of the other estimators. The TMVDR only requires one searching number F3=1 and its performance heavily depends on the initial search angles. The local minimum searching problem leads to a degradation of the effectiveness of the TMVDR estimator. Although the GA-based estimator uses shorter searching times (defines as: population size x evolution generations) compared with the traditional MUSIC and MVDR methods, it still requires more searching times to obtain excellent estimation accuracy. Moreover, the GA/IMVDR with μ2=10−4 can achieve almost the same RMSE performance as the GA/TMVDR does, but its computational complexity is high. To compare the required computational complexities, a plot of the computational complexity versus the number of array elements is displayed in Fig. 3. For MUSIC and MVDR, the number of searches was F1=180, 001. For GA-based estimator, the number of searches was 1000 and 2500. Next, for the GA/IMVDR, the average number of generations was N=18 and the average number of iterations were F2=120 and F2=205. Finally, the average number of generations was N=10 for the proposed method, and the average number of iterations was only F3=1 for the TMVDR method. The computational complexity increased as the number of array elements increased, but the proposed approach maintained a lower computational complexity than that of other estimators. However, the GA/TMVDR estimator is high accuracy and fast convergence with weak dependence on initial parameters. Fig. 4presents RMSE of the DOA estimation versus different number of bits processed under SNR=10dB. As we observed, both of the GA/IMVDR and GA/TMVDR require about 200 bits to attain convergence. But, it is noted that the performance of GA-based estimator do not gain the benefits than the other estimators. The main reason is that its performance deteriorates as it approaches the desired global extreme. But, the proposed approach can improve the estimating accuracy than the GA-based and GA/IMVDR estimators. It seems to converge more rapidly than the other estimators. Fig. 5shows that the RMSE of DOA estimation versus different SNR of the desired user. Although the GA-based estimator cannot obtain more accuracy DOA estimation, this estimate angle can be provided to the TMVDR estimator as an initial search angle to avoid the local minimum searching problem. In this figure, it shows that the performance of the GA/TMVDR, TMVDR with initial angle=1°, GA/IMVDR with μ2=10−4, MUSIC, and MVDR are nearly identical when the initial angle is correctly estimated. It is obvious that the estimation accuracy of the GA/IMVDR heavily depends on the search grid. However, it can be demonstrated that the DOA estimation of the TMVDR estimator is vulnerable to the effect by the initial value. And, it is obvious that the performance of the TMVDR heavily depends on initial value. Therefore, the proposed GA/TMVDR estimator is a preferable choice than the other estimators.Example 2: Here, an 8-element ULA is used with half-wavelength interelement spacing and ten CDMA users. The impinging angles of all nine interferers with equal power INR=10dB are [−50°, −35°, −12°, 17°, 20°, 33°, 40°, 50°, 70°]. The desired user is impinging on the array with directional angle of θ1=0°. Table 3compares the RMSE of the method proposed in this paper with that of other methods. However, the DOA estimation of CDMA signals with high MAI is quite complicated in this case. Fig. 6shows the complexity versus the number of array elements Assume that F1=180, 001, F2=123 and F2=210, and F3=1. From these figures, we find that the computational complexity of the proposed method still provided a good result. Fig. 7presents RMSE of the DOA estimation versus different number of bits processed. However, the proposed method still exhibits the improvement in estimating accuracy as expected corresponding to the GA-based and GA/IMVDR estimators. Fig. 8depicts the RMSE performance versus different SNR of the desired user. In this case, the result shows again that the proposed GA/TMVDR estimator not only retains the benefits for one searching process, but also gains the improvement in DOA estimating accuracy. Thus, the proposed estimator can further reduce the searching load and save the processing requirements. Similarly, we also compare the sensitivity for the TMVDR estimator with different initial angles to DOA estimation error, that it is shown the DOA estimation with the TMVDR estimator is vulnerable to the effect by the initial angles.
