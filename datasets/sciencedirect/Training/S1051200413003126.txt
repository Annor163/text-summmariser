@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The accuracy of a source location estimate is very sensitive to the presence of the random noise in the known sensor positions. This paper investigates the use of calibration sensors, each of which is capable of broadcasting calibration signals to other sensors as well as receiving the signals from the source and other calibration sensors, to reduce the loss in the source localization accuracy due to uncertainties in sensor positions. We begin the study with deriving the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) for source localization using time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements when a single calibration sensor is available. The obtained CRLB result is then extended to the more general case with multiple calibration sensors. The performance improvement due to the use of calibration sensors is established analytically. We then propose a closed-form algorithm that can explore efficiently the calibration sensors to improve the source localization accuracy when the sensor positions are subject to random errors. We prove analytically that the newly developed localization method attains the CRLB accuracy under some mild approximations. Simulations verify the theoretical developments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The localization of emitting sources using an array of spatially-distributed sensors has been one of the central problems in radar, sonar and navigation [1,2]. Recently, it found applications in sensor networks [3,4] and microphone arrays [5]. Commonly used positioning parameters include time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angle of arrival (AOA). When there is relative motion between the source and sensors, frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) [6] can also be utilized to improve the source location estimation accuracy.During the past few decades, a number of algorithms for source localization became available in literature. Some methods are iterative and require good initial solution guesses [7], while some are closed-form solutions, such as the two-stage least squares (LS) method [8], the linear-correction least squares (LCLS) method [9], the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique [10] and many others [11–20]. It has been shown that the localization performance of the above methods relies heavily on the availability of accurate knowledge on the sensor positions. When sensor location errors are present, their source localization accuracy would be degraded significantly and no longer reach the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) [21].Differential calibration (DC) [22] is a commonly used technique in the global positioning systems (GPS) for mitigating the impact of uncertainties in satellite positions on the localization performance. Recently, Ho and Yang [23] showed that the DC approach is generally unable to achieve the CRLB accuracy. They proposed a closed-form solution that can explore efficiently the signals from a single calibration emitter so that the obtained source localization accuracy attains the CRLB. In [24], they generalized the work in [23] to the more general case with multiple calibration emitters. In this case, the calibration emitters could be sensors in the sensor array and they are dedicated calibration emitters, while the remaining sensors in the array are receiving sensors for the source localization task.This paper extends the work in [24] in the following two aspects. First, we shall consider the case where each calibration emitter is able to receive signals from the source to be localized and other calibration emitters, as receiving sensors. As such, they become calibration sensors and besides broadcasting calibration signals, they can also contribute to the source localization task in a direct manner. It can be expected that with calibration sensors, the source localization accuracy in the presence of sensor location uncertainties can be further improved over the case where some sensors are used as dedicated calibration emitters as in [24]. The performance improvement mainly comes from the additional source positioning parameters from calibration sensors. Second, this paper investigates source localization using TDOA and FDOA measurements, which is more general over [24] that considered the TDOA-only source localization. The use of TDOA and FDOA measurements enables us to estimate both the source position and velocity, rather than the source position only in the TDOA positioning scenario.The use of calibration sensors has been a common technique in wireless sensor network self-localization (see e.g., [25,26] and references therein), where each sensor broadcasts signals and receives signals from other sensors so as to determine their positions collaboratively. In source localization, Hasan first considered in [27] utilizing calibration sensors to improve the AOA localization performance.This paper starts with deriving the CRLB for source localization using one calibration sensor only, and then generalizes the results to the case of multiple calibration sensors. A closed-form method for locating a source with TDOA, FDOA and calibration sensors is proposed and it is shown analytically to be able to attain the CRLB accuracy under Gaussian measurement and sensor location errors. We shall demonstrate via theoretical analysis and simulations that the use of calibration sensors can lead to better source localization accuracy over the case where all sensors are receiving sensors (i.e., there is no calibration sensors) and the case in [24] where some sensors are dedicated calibration emitters while others are receiving sensors.We organize the rest of this paper as follows. In Section 2, the localization scenario is described. The CRLB analyses are performed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the proposed closed-form localization method. Section 5 gives the simulation results to corroborate the theoretical development. Section 6 concludes the paper.Following the convention, this paper uses bold face lower case letters to represent column vectors and bold face upper case letters to denote matrices.{⋅}ois the noise-free version of{⋅}andΔ{⋅}is the noise term such that{⋅}={⋅}o+Δ{⋅}.We consider the problem of localizing a source in 3D as illustrated in Fig. 1. The position and velocity of the moving source, denoted byuo=[xo,yo,zo]Tandu˙o=[x˙o,y˙o,z˙o]T, are to be determined. An array of M sensors for source localization are at positionssio=[xio,yio,zio]Tand moving with velocitiess˙io=[x˙io,y˙io,z˙io]T, wherei=1,2,…,M. Different from the scenario in [24], in this work, some of the sensors in the array are calibration sensors while others are receiving sensors. All sensors can receive the source and calibration signals but only calibration sensors can broadcast calibration signals.For notation simplicity, we collectsioands˙ioinso=[s1oT,s2oT,…,sMoT]Tands˙o=[s˙1oT,s˙2oT,…,s˙MoT]T. In this work,soands˙oare not known. In other words, both the calibration sensors and the receiving sensors have location errors. The sensor location vector available to the source localization task isβ=[sT,s˙T]T=βo+Δβ, whereβo=[soT,s˙oT]T. The location error inβisΔβ=[ΔsT,Δs˙T]T, whereΔs=[Δs1T,Δs2T,…,ΔsMT]TandΔs˙=[Δs˙1T,Δs˙2T,…,Δs˙MT]T.Δβis assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrixQβ=diag{Qs1,…,QsM,Q˙s1,…,Q˙sM}, whereQsiandQ˙siare the covariance matrices ofΔsiandΔs˙iandi=1,2,…,M.Qβhas a block diagonal structure, which implies that the location errors of different sensors are independent of one another. This assumption comes from the observation that because sensors are spatially distributed, they are likely to have independent location errors. This Gaussian noise model has also been adopted in [21,23,24].The TDOA and FDOA of the source signal received at the sensor array are estimated with sensor 1 as the reference sensor for locating the source. We shall denote the true distance between the sourceuoand sensorsioasrio, which is equal to(1)rio=‖uo−sio‖where‖⁎‖represents the 2-norm. Letr˙iobe the true range rate betweenuoandsio, i.e.,(2)r˙io=(uo−sio)T(u˙o−s˙io)rio.As such, the source TDOAdi1and the source FDOAd˙i1between sensor pair i and 1 are(3)di1=ri1c=1c(ri1o+ni1),i=2,3,…,M,(4)d˙i1=focr˙i1=foc(r˙i1o+n˙i1),i=2,3,…,M,where c is the propagation speed of the source signal andfois the signal carrier frequency.ni1candfocn˙i1are the source TDOA and FDOA measurement noises.ri1ois the true range difference andr˙i1ois the true range rate difference. Mathematically, we have, from (1) and (2),ri1o=rio−r1o,r˙i1o=r˙io−r˙1o.The vector collection of source TDOA measurements after being multiplied by the source signal propagation speed c isr=[r21,r31,…,rM1]T=ro+Δrand that of source FDOA measurements after being multiplied by the source signal wavelengthcfoisr˙=[r˙21,r˙31,…,r˙M1]T=r˙o+Δr˙. Combining r andr˙yields the source signal measurement vectorα=[rT,r˙T]T. The noise inαisΔα=[ΔrT,Δr˙T]T, whereΔr=[n21,n31,…,nM1]TandΔr=[n˙21,n˙31,…,n˙M1]T. It is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian vector with covariance matrixQα=diag{Qr,Qr˙}. We further assume that the measurement noiseΔαis independent of the sensor location errorΔβ.The block diagonal structure ofQαindicates that we assume the noises in the source TDOA and FDOA measurements are independent of each other. This comes from the common practice of extracting the signal TDOA and FDOA using the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator such as the one based on cross ambiguity function (CAF) maximization [30]. Under the condition that the source signal is a stationary Gaussian process, the estimated TDOA and FDOA would have a covariance matrix asymptotically equal to the CRLB, which is also block diagonal. This justifies our assumption on the statistical independence of the source TDOA and FDOA measurements. However, it is also worthwhile to point out that the theoretical results and the localization technique proposed in this paper can be extended in a straightforward manner to the case where the TDOA and FDOA noises are no longer independent, e.g., when source signals are chirp signals, and they are non-stationary and/or non-Gaussian [31].The CRLB is known to be the best accuracy that an unbiased estimator can achieve [28]. The trace of the CLRB gives the lowest estimation mean square error (MSE). In this section, we shall derive for the source localization scenario presented in Section 2 the CRLB of the source location estimate. In particular, two cases will be considered. In the first case, among the M sensors, there is only one calibration sensor. We shall then extend the obtained results to the second case where there are multiple calibration sensors. The purpose is to investigate the effect of using calibration sensors on the source localization accuracy in the presence of sensor location uncertainties. Numerical examples are presented at the end of this section to illustrate the theoretical results.In this case, only sensor 1,s1o, is a calibration sensor. Its calibration signal broadcasting is received by the otherM−1receiving sensors (sio,i=2,…,M), and the TDOA and FDOA of the calibration signal are estimated. Letri,s1obe the true distance betweensioand the calibration sensors1o, andr˙i,s1othe true range rate between them, i.e.,(5)ri,s1o=‖sio−s1o‖,i=2,3,…,M,(6)r˙i,s1o=(sio−s1o)T(s˙io−s˙1o)‖sio−s1o‖,i=2,3,…,M.Letdi2,s1be the measured calibration TDOA betweensioands2o, andd˙i2,s1be the measured calibration FDOA between them. They are obtained with sensor 2 as the reference sensor. We have(7)di2,s1=ri2,s1c=1c(ri2,s1o+ni2,s1),i=3,4,…,M,(8)d˙i2,s1=focr˙i2,s1=foc(r˙i2,s1o+n˙i2,s1),i=3,4,…,M.ri2,s1ois the true range difference andr˙i2,s1ois the true range rate difference. They are equal tori2,s1o=ri,s1o−r2,s1o,r˙i2,s1o=r˙i,s1o−r˙2,s1o.Collectingri2,s1andr˙i2,s1in two column vectors yieldsrs1=[r32,s1,r42,s1,…,rM2,s1]T=rs1o+Δrs1andr˙s1=[r˙32,s1,r˙42,s1,…,r˙M2,s1]T=r˙s1o+Δr˙s1. The measurement noise vectorsΔrs1andΔr˙s1are equal toΔrs1=[n32,s1,n42,s1,…,nM2,s1]TandΔr˙s1=[n˙32,s1,n˙42,s1,…,n˙M2,s1]T. Combiningrs1andr˙s1gives the calibration measurement vectorγ1=[rs1T,r˙s1T]T. As the source TDOA and FDOA measurement noise vectorΔα, we model the noise inγ1, which isΔγ1=[Δrs1T,Δr˙s1T]T, as a zero mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrixQγ1=diag{Qs1,Q˙s1}.Qs1andQ˙s1are the covariance matrices ofΔrs1andΔr˙s1, respectively. It is assumed thatΔγ1is independent of bothΔαand the sensor location error vectorΔβ.We proceed to derive the CRLB of the source location parameter vectorθo=[uoT,u˙oT]T. From Section 2 and the description above, the observed data are the TDOA and FDOA of signals from the sourceuoand the calibration sensors1o. They are collected inαandγ1, which are independently Gaussian distributed. Besidesθo, the other unknown quantity isβo, which is the true sensor location vector. Its noisy but known versionβ, which is also Gaussian distributed, can be considered as observed data.To find the CRLB ofθo, we define the composite unknown vectorφ=[θoT,βoT]T. The logarithm of probability density function (PDF) of the data vectorm=[αT,βT,γ1T]Tis(9)lnp(m;φ)=J−12(α−αo)TQα−1(α−αo)−12(β−βo)TQβ−1(β−βo)−12(γ1−γ1o)TQγ1−1(γ1−γ1o)where J is a constant that is not dependent onφ. The CRLB ofφis equal to [28](10)CRLB(φ)1=−E[∂lnp(m;φ)∂φ∂φT]−1=[XYYTZ1]−1where X, Y andZ1are(11)X=−E[∂2lnp∂θo∂θoT]=(∂αo∂θo)TQα−1(∂αo∂θo),(12)Y=−E[∂2lnp∂θo∂βoT]=(∂αo∂θo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo),(13)Z1=−E[∂2lnp∂βo∂βoT]=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+Qβ−1+(∂γ1o∂βo)TQγ1−1(∂γ1o∂βo).The partial derivatives are given in Appendix A. Invoking the partitioned matrix inversion formula [29] in (10) and using the definition ofφ, we can obtain the CRLB of the source location parameter vectorθowhen a single calibration sensor is available, which is given by(14)CRLB(θo)1=X−1+X−1Y(Z1−YTX−1Y)−1YTX−1.Note thatX−1is the CRLB ofθowhen sensor locations are known accurately.With imprecisely known sensor locations, the CRLB ofθowithout using the calibration sensors1ois [21](15)CRLB(θo)=X−1+X−1Y(Z−YTX−1Y)−1YTX−1whereZ=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+Qβ−1. Comparing (14) with (15) reveals that they have similar functional forms exceptZ1in (14) is replaced by Z. LetZ˜1=(∂γ1o∂βo)TQγ1−1(∂γ1o∂βo). We have(Z1−YTX−1Y)−1=((Z−YTX−1Y)+Z˜1)−1. Applying the matrix inversion lemma [29] to((Z−YTX−1Y)+Z˜1)−1, substituting the result back into (14) and subtracting (14) from (15) yield(16)CRLB(θo)−CRLB(θo)1=X−1YΓ1YTX−1where(17)Γ1=A−1B1(I+B1TA−1B1)−1B1TA−1,(18)A=Z−YTX−1Y.B1is the Cholesky decomposition ofZ˜1, i.e.,Z˜1=B1B1T. The term on the right hand side of (16) is a positive semidefinite matrix, which represents the performance improvement due to the use of a single calibration sensor.Without the loss of generality, we assume that sensorssjo,j=1,2,…,N, are calibration sensors, whereN>1. In this case, the signal from each calibration sensor would be received byM−Nreceiving sensor and the otherN−1calibration sensors. To avoid confusion when introducing symbols for the TDOA and FDOA of the calibration signal fromsjo, we definetijas(19)tij={i+j,ifi+j⩽M,i+j−M,ifi+j>M.Intij, i is an integer taking the value from 1 toM−1so as to index theM−1sensors that receives the signal from the calibration sensorsjo.Letri,sjobe the true distance betweensjoandstijo(i=1,2,…,M−1), andr˙i,sjobe the true range rate between them. They are equal to(20)ri,sjo=‖stijo−sjo‖,j=1,…,N,(21)r˙i,sjo=(stijo−sjo)T(s˙tijo−s˙jo)ri,sjo,j=1,…,N.Withri,sjoandr˙i,sjodefined in (20) and (21), we can express the measured TDOAdi1,sjoand FDOAd˙i1,sjoof the calibration signal fromsjoreceived atstioandst1oas(22)di1,sj=ri1,sjc=1c(ri1,sjo+ni1,sj),i=2,…,M−1,(23)fi1,sj=focr˙i1,sj=foc(r˙i1,sjo+n˙i1,sj),i=2,…,M−1,whereri1,sjoandr˙i1,sjoare the true range and range rate differences equal tori1,sjo=ri,sjo−r1,sjo,r˙i1,sjo=r˙i,sjo−r˙1,sjo.We collectri1,sjoandr˙i1,sjofor notation simplicity and form two column vectorsrsj=[r21,sj,r31,sj,…,r(M−1)1,sj]T=rsjo+Δrsjandr˙sj=[r˙21,sj,r˙31,sj,…,r˙(M−1)1,sj]T=r˙sjo+Δr˙sj. Puttingrsjandr˙sjtogether yields the measurement vector from the calibration sensorsjo,γj=γjo+Δγj, whereγj=[rsjT,r˙sjT]Tandγjo=[rsjoTr˙sjoT]T. The measure noiseΔγj=[ΔrsjT,Δr˙sjT]Tis modeled as a zero mean Gaussian random vector with covariance matrixQγj=diag{Qsj,Q˙sj}. Combiningγjogenerates the calibration signal measurement vectorγ=γo+Δγ, whereγ=[γ1T,…,γNT]Tandγo=[γ1oT,…,γNoT]T.Δγ=[Δγ1T,Δγ2T,…,ΔγNT]Tis Gaussian distributed with zero mean and covariance matrixQγ=diag{Qγ1,…,QγN}.Similar to Section 3.1, in this case, we are interested in estimating the source positionuoand velocityu˙oinθo=[uoT,u˙oT]T. The available observed data include the source signal TDOA and FDOA inαand the calibration signal TDOA and FDOA inγ. Another set of observed data comes from the known sensor locations inβ. Its true value, the true sensor locationsβo, are also unknown. The composite measurement vectorm=[αT,βT,γT]Tis Gaussian distributed.The CRLB ofθowith multiple calibration sensors can be found by following the same approach that leads toCRLB(θo)1in (14) in Section 3.1. In particular, defining the composite unknown vectorφ=[θoT,βoT]T, we can show that its CRLB in the multiple calibration sensor case is(24)CRLB(φ)2=−E[∂lnp(m;φ)∂φ∂φT]−1=[XYYTZ2]−1where X, Y are defined in (11) and (12), andZ2is given by(25)Z2=−E[∂2lnp∂βo∂βoT]=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+Qβ−1+∑j=1N(∂γjo∂βo)TQγj−1(∂γjo∂βo).The partial derivative∂γjo/∂βois derived in Appendix B. From (24), the CRLB ofθowith multiple calibration sensors is(26)CRLB(θo)2=X−1+X−1Y(Z2−YTX−1Y)−1YTX−1.To quantify the improvement in terms of reduction in the source localization CRLB due to the use of calibration sensors, we defineZ˜2asZ˜2=∑j=1N(∂γjo∂βo)TQγj−1(∂γjo∂βo).By following the same derivation leading to (16), we arrive at(27)CRLB(θo)−CRLB(θo)2=X−1YΓ2YTX−1where(28)Γ2=A−1B2(I+B2TA−1B2)−1B2TA−1.A is defined in (18), andB2is the Cholesky decomposition ofZ˜2, i.e.,Z˜2=B2B2T. The termX−1YΓ2YTX−1in (27) is positive semidefinite. It is the amount of localization performance improvement brought by using N calibration sensors.We generate numerical results using the same localization geometry as in [21] to illustrate the obtained CRLB results. There are six sensors in total (i.e.,M=6), and their true positions and velocities are given in Table 1. Two sets of numerical results are produced, one for the case when the source is a near-field one at(600,650,550)mand the other for the source a far-field one at(2000,2500,3000)m. In both cases, the source moves with the velocity(−20,15,40)m/s.LetQ1andQ2be square matrices whose diagonal elements are 1 and off-diagonal elements are 0.5. They have dimensions of(M−1)×(M−1)and(M−2)×(M−2). We setQαandQγj, which are the covariance matrices of the TDOA and FDOA measurementsαandγjfrom the source and calibration sensorsjo, to beQα=diag{Q1×10−4,Q1×10−6}andQγj=diag{Q1×10−4,Q1×10−6}[21,23,24]. We defineRs=σs2diag[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,10,10,10,20,20,20,30,30,30]andR˙s=0.5Rsso that the covariance matrix of the known sensor locationsβisQβ=diag{Rs,R˙s}. Note that the diagonal elements ofRsandR˙sare not equal to one another, which indicates that sensors have different location error powers.Fig. 2examines the CRLB of locating the near-field source as function of the sensor location error powerσs2and Fig. 3plots the corresponding results for the far-field source. The curve labeled with CRLB1 is the CRLB of the source location estimates when sensor locations are known precisely, i.e., the termX−1in (14). The curve CRLB2 shows the results ofCRLB(θo)in (15), where no calibration sensors are available. The curves CRLB3 and CRLB4 are the CRLBs of the source location estimates when there is one calibration sensors1oand when all six sensors are calibration sensors (seeCRLB(θo)1andCRLB(θo)2in (14) and (26)).We can observe from Figs. 2 and 3 that the source localization accuracy can be improved significantly via the use of calibration sensors, compared with the case where all sensors are receiving sensors. For the near-field source, when only sensor 1 is a calibration sensor and the sensor location error power isσs2=10−2, we can obtain a reduction of 2.96 dB in source position estimation CRLB, while for the source velocity, the amount of estimation CRLB decrease is 3.76 dB. If all sensors can broadcast calibration signals, the improvement in source location estimation accuracy would further increase, as expected. Similar observations can be obtained for the far-field source. In particular, the estimation CRLB for the source position and velocity can be decreased by 7.05 dB and 7.89 dB with only sensor 1 being the calibration sensor and the sensor location error variance being equal toσs2=10−2. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of using calibration sensors in enhancing the source localization performance when the known sensor locations have errors.In this section, we shall develop a novel method that can efficiently explore the TDOA and FDOA measurements from the unknown source to be localized as well as the calibration sensors to identify the source position and velocity. The proposed method is similar to the source localization techniques developed in [23] and [24] in the sense that we first utilize the calibration signal measurements to improve the sensor locations and then locate the unknown source with the refined sensor positions. But our method is developed for the scenario where the calibration signals are broadcast by calibration sensors in the sensor array for source localization, and the source is localized using both TDOA and FDOA measurements. In contrast, the methods from [23] and [24] considered the use of dedicated calibration emitters and exploit TDOA measurements only.The newly developed source localization method has two processing steps. The first step, termed as the calibration step, utilizes the TDOA and FDOA from the calibration sensors to refine the known sensor locations. The second step of the proposed algorithm, referred to as the localization step, finds the source location parameters using the source TDOA and FDOA, as well as the improved sensor locations obtained in the calibration step. Both processing steps are in closed-form, which renders the new source localization method a computationally attractive closed-form technique. Moreover, as will be shown analytically in Section 4.3, the proposed localization method is able to attain the CRLB accuracy under some mild conditions, i.e., it is a statistically efficient estimator of the source location parameters.We shall present the source localization algorithms for two cases, one with a single calibration sensor and the other with multiple calibration sensors. The developed algorithms differ in their first step processing only and they will be given separately in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. The localization step of the two developed algorithms has the same computation as the localization technique in [21].The idea behind the calibration step is as follows. The sensor locationsβare known but subject to random errorsΔβ. As a result, usingβ, we are able to produce a predicted version of the TDOA and FDOA from calibration sensors. The difference between the predicted and measured calibration TDOA and FDOA would be dependent on the sensor location errorΔβas well as the measurement noise. The calibration step utilizes this difference to find an estimate ofΔβand subtract it fromβto refine sensor locations. We shall prove that the updated sensor locations are at least as good as the original sensor locationsβ.In this case, sensors1ois the calibration sensor, as in Section 3.1. The predicted calibration TDOA and FDOA are, after the substitution of known sensor locationsβinto (7) and (8),(29)gi2,s1=‖s1−si‖−‖s1−s2‖,i=3,…,M,(30)g˙i2,s1=(s˙1−s˙i)T(s1−si)‖s1−si‖−(s˙1−s˙2)T(s1−s2)‖s1−s2‖,i=3,…,M,where we have multiplied the predicted TDOA and FDOA with the signal propagation speed c and the signal wavelengthc/fo. Expressing the known sensor locations in terms of their true values and location errors assk=sko+Δskands˙k=s˙ko+Δs˙k,k=1,…,M, applying the first-order Taylor-series expansion to (29) and (30), and subtracting the results from the measured calibration TDOA and FDOA yield(31)ri2,s1−gi2,s1=Δri2,s1+c˜iTΔsi−c˜2TΔs2−(c˜iT−c˜2T)Δs1,(32)r˙i2,s1−g˙i2,s1=Δr˙i2,s1+c˜iTΔs˙i+d˜iTΔsi−c˜2TΔs˙2−d˜2TΔs2−(c˜iT−c˜2T)Δs˙1−(d˜iT−d˜2T)Δs1.c˜iandd˜ihave the same functional form ascianddidefined in (66) and (67) in Appendix A, except that the true sensor locations incianddiare replaced by their noisy values.Leths1be a2(M−2)×1vector whose firstM−2elements areri2,s1o−gi2,s1,i=3,…,M, and the remainingM−2elements arer˙i2,s1o−g˙i2,s1,i=3,…,M. Stacking (31) and (32) then yields(33)hs1=Gs1Δβ+Δγ1where(34)Gs1=[−D3,s1O(M−2)×3M−D4,s1−D3,s1]2(M−2)×6M.It can be verified using (31) and (32) thatD3,s1andD4,s1in (34) have the same functional form as∂rs1o/∂soand∂r˙s1o/∂sogiven in (71) and (76) in Appendix A. The difference is that the true sensor locations in (71) and (76) are replaced by their known valuesβ.Recall from Section 2 that the sensor location error vectorΔβis a zero mean Gaussian distributed random vector with covariance matrixQβ. Invoking the Bayesian Gauss–Markov theorem [28], the linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator ofΔβis(35)Δβˆ=[Qβ−1+Gs1TQγ1−1Gs1]−1Gs1TQγ1−1hs1.The covariance matrix ofΔβˆis(36)cov(Δβ−Δβˆ)=[Qβ−1+Gs1TQγ1−1Gs1]−1.SubtractingΔβˆfrom the known sensor location vectorβproduces the improved sensor location vectorβˆ, which is(37)βˆ=β−Δβˆ=βo+Δβ−Δβˆ.We can verify from (37) that the covariance matrix of improved sensor location vectorβˆis alsocov(Δβ−Δβˆ)in (36). Contrasting it with the covariance matrix ofβyields(38)cov(β)−cov(βˆ)=Qβ−[Qβ−1+Gs1TQγ1−1Gs1]−1.It can be shown by applying the matrix inversion lemma thatcov(β)−cov(βˆ)is positive semidefinite. As such, the updated sensor locationsβˆare at least as good as the original ones.Assuming as in Section 3.2 that N sensors,sjo(1⩽j⩽N), are calibration sensors, we can express the predicted calibration TDOA and FDOA using (22), (23) and the noisy sensors locationsβas(39)gi1,sj=‖sj−sti‖−‖sj−st1‖,(40)g˙i1,sj=(s˙j−s˙ti)T(sj−sti)‖sj−sti‖−(s˙j−s˙t1)T(sj−st1)‖sj−st1‖wheretijis the sensor index defined in (19). Following the same way that leads to (31) and (32) yields(41)ri1,sj−gi1,sj=Δri1,sj+c˜tij,sjTΔstij−c˜t1j,sjTΔst1j−(c˜tij,sjT−c˜t1j,sjT)Δsj,(42)r˙i1,sj−g˙i1,sj=Δr˙i1,sj+c˜tij,sjTΔs˙tij+d˜tij,sjTΔstij−c˜t1j,sjTΔs˙t1j−d˜t1j,sjTΔst1j−(c˜tij,sjT−c˜t1j,sjT)Δs˙j−(d˜tij,sjT−d˜t1j,sjT)Δsjwherec˜tij,sjandd˜tij,sjare obtained by substituting the known sensor locations intoctij,sjanddtij,sjdefined in (79) and (80) in Appendix B.Definehsjas a2(M−2)×1vector that collectsri1,sj−gi1,sjandr˙i1,sj−g˙i1,sj,i=2,…,M−1, ashs1in (33). Then, putting (41) and (42) in matrix form, we arrive at(43)hsj=GsjΔβ+Δγjwhere(44)Gsj=[−D3,sjO(M−2)×3M−D4,sj−D3,sj]2(M−2)×6M.D3,sjandD4,sjare obtained via substituting into∂rsjo/∂soand∂r˙sjo/∂so(see (84) and (93) in Appendix B) the known sensor locations. Stacking (43) forj=1,2,…,Ngives(45)h=GsΔβ+Δγwherehs=[hs1T,hs2T,…,hsNT]T,Gs=[Gs1T,Gs2T,…,GsNT]T,Δγ=[Δγ1T,Δγ2T,…,ΔγNT]T.Applying again the Bayesian Gauss–Markov theorem [28], we obtain the LMMSE estimator ofΔβ(46)Δβˆ=[Qβ−1+GsTQγ−1Gs]−1GsTQγ−1hs,whose covariance matrix is(47)cov(Δβ−Δβˆ)=[Qβ−1+GsTQγ−1Gs]−1.SubtractingΔβˆin (46) from the original sensor location vectorβyields the improved sensor location vectorβˆof the calibration step, which is equal to(48)βˆ=β−Δβˆ=βo+Δβ−Δβˆ.The covariance matrix ofβˆis given in (47) and it can be contrasted with that ofβas(49)cov(β)−cov(βˆ)=Qβ−[Qβ−1+GsTQγ−1Gs]−1,which is a positive semidefinite matrix. This implies that with multiple calibration sensors, the calibration step of the proposed algorithm would yield updated sensor locations with covariance matrix no higher than that of the original ones.In the localization step, the improved sensor locationsβˆfrom the calibration step together with the source TDOA r and FDOAr˙are used to estimate the source locationuoand velocityu˙o. The processing of this step is the same as the source localization algorithm in [21], except that the known sensor locations in [21] are replaced withβˆ. We shall summarize the computations below for completeness of this paper. The algorithm details can be found in [21].The pseudo linear solution equation for the unknown vectorψ1o=[uoT,rˆ1o,u˙oT,r˙ˆ1o]Tis [21](50)ε1=h1−G1ψ1owhereh1andG1are defined in (20) and (26) of [21]. The weighted least squares (WLS) solution to (50) is(51)ψ1=(G1TW1G1)−1G1TW1h2whereW1is a weighting matrix defined in (33) of [21].Exploring the functional relationship amonguo,u˙o,rˆ1oandr˙ˆ1oresults in the following equation(52)ε2=h2−G2ψ2owhere the unknown vectorψ2ois(53)ψ2o=[(uo−sˆ1)⊙(uo−sˆ1)(uo−sˆ1)⊙(u˙o−s˙ˆ1)],h2andG2are defined in (40) of [21], and ⊙ represents the element by element multiplication.sˆ1ands˙ˆ1are the updated location and velocity of sensor 1 from the calibration step. Applying the WLS minimization to (53) yields the estimate(54)ψ2=(G2TW2G2)−1G2TW2h2,whereW2is a weighting matrix defined in (43) of [21].The source location estimate u andu˙is obtained using(55)u=ψ2(1:3)+sˆ1,u˙=ψ2(4:6)/ψ2(1:3)+s˙ˆ1,whereψ2(1:3)denotes the vector that contains the first three elements ofψ2andψ2(4:6)represents the vector that contains the last three elements ofψ2.We shall establish the efficiency of the proposed localization technique through contrasting the estimation covariance matrix of u andu˙in (55) with the CRLB. We shall provide the proof for the multiple calibration sensor case only. The analysis for the single calibration sensor scenario follows as a special case.From [21], we know that the under small Gaussian measurement and sensor location errors, the covariance matrix of the localization step outputθ=[uT,u˙T]T, which is the estimate of the source location parameter vectorθo=[uoT,u˙oT]T(see Section 3), is approximately equal to(56)cov(θ)2≃X−1+X−1Y(Zˆ−YTX−1Y)−1YTX−1where(57)Zˆ=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+cov(Δβ−Δβˆ)−1.In deriving (56), we have substituted the covariance matrix of the improved sensor locationscov(Δβ−Δβˆ). Comparing (56) and (26) reveals that they have the same functional form. We next show thatZˆ≃Z2, whereZ2is defined in (25), to prove the efficiency of the proposed localization technique. For this purpose, putting (47) into (57) yields(58)Zˆ=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+Qβ−1+GsTQγ−1Gs=(∂αo∂βo)TQα−1(∂αo∂βo)+Qβ−1+∑j=1NGsjTQγj−1Gsj.ComparingGsjin (44) and∂γjo/∂βin (78) reveals thatGsj≃−∂γjo∂βo,and as a result,Zˆ≃Z2. This completes the proof thatcov(θ)2≃CRLB(θo)2. In other words, the localization method described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 can attain the CRLB accuracy of the source location parameters.We shall illustrate the performance of the proposed closed-form localization method through simulations. The localization geometry is the same as those that generated Figs. 2 and 3 in Section 3.3. The estimation accuracy of the localization method developed in Section 4 is quantified usingMSE(u)=∑j=1Num‖uˆj−uo‖2/NumandMSE(u˙)=∑j=1Num‖u˙ˆj−u˙o‖2/Num. They provide respectively the estimation MSEs for the source locationuoand velocityu˙o.Num=2000is the number of ensemble runs.uˆjandu˙ˆjdenote the estimates ofuoandu˙oin the jth ensemble run.We plot the simulation results of the first experiment in Figs. 4 and 5, where Fig. 4 shows the results for the near-field source while Fig. 5 gives the results for the far-field source. In both figures, the simulation results are shown as function of the sensor location error powerσs2and they can be grouped into three sets. The first set of results, denoted as CRLB2 and MSE2, showsCRLB(θo)in (15), the CRLB when all sensors are receiving sensors, and the estimation MSE of the localization algorithm in [21] that locates a source using TDOA and FDOA measurements in the presence of sensor location errors but without calibration emitters or sensors. The second set of results is given by curves labeled with CRLB3 and MSE3. They showCRLB(θo)1in (14), which is the CRLB of source location parameters with sensor 1 being a calibration sensor, and the estimation MSE of the new localization method proposed in Section 4. The third set of results plotsCRLB(θo)2in (26), the CRLB when all sensors are calibration sensors, and the estimation MSE of the algorithm in Section 4. They are denoted by curves with labels CRLB4 and MSE4.From Figs. 4 and 5, we can see that with one calibration sensor, when the sensor location error powerσs2is below −10 in log scale, the localization method developed in Section 4 can locate the near-field and far-field sources with accuracy approximately equal to the CRLB. This observation also holds for the case when all sensors are calibration sensors. This validates the efficiency of the newly proposed localization method established theoretically in Section 4.3. In other words, when the sensor locations are erroneous, the improvement in the source localization accuracy brought by the use of calibration sensors (compare CRLB2 with CRLB3 and CRLB4) is achievable with the proposed localization method.In the second experiment, we shall contrast the proposed localization technique with that from [24]. The setup is as follows. Both algorithms use an array ofM=6sensors to locate the source. The true sensor locations and velocities are given in Table 1 in Section 3.3. When realizing the localization method developed in Section 4, we set that sensor 1 is a calibration sensor. On the other hand, the method in [24] uses sensor 1 in the array as a dedicated calibration emitter and it has been extended to be able to explore both TDOA and FDOA measurements. We compare in Figs. 6 and 7the estimation performance of the above two localization methods in locating the same near-field and far-field sources as in the first experiment. Similar to Figs. 4 and 5, the simulation results are shown as function of the sensor location error powerσs2. Also included in the figures are the associated CRLBs of the source location parameters for the case when sensor 1 is a calibration sensor and the case when sensor 1 is a dedicated calibration emitter. We can see from Figs. 6 and 7 that the proposed localization method offers an amount of about 5 dB improvement in the source localization accuracy whenσs2increases over −40 in log scale. The performance improvement comes from the extra TDOA and FDOA provided by the calibration sensor. This demonstrates the advantage of using calibration sensors over using them as dedicated calibration emitters as in [24].
