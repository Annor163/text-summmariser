@&#ABSTRACT@&#
ObjectiveTo determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews.MethodsTest collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics.ResultsThe AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles.ConclusionAutomatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Evidence-based medicine (EBM), the philosophical origins of which extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions regarding individual patient care [1]. EBM is an important development in clinical practice and scholarly research because this approach aims to provide better care with better outcomes through referring clinical decisions mainly on solid scientific evidence [2]. Because EBM directly applies the knowledge gained from large clinical trials to patient care, it promotes consistency in individual patient treatments, optimal clinical outcomes and quality of life [3]. The practice of EBM integrates individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.Systematic review (SR) plays a key role in EBM [4] and attempts to identify, appraise, and synthesize all empirical evidence that meets the pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a given question [5]. SR is processed in four distinct steps [6]. In the first step, the review topic and key questions are defined; then, all relevant studies are retrieved from a number of different databases, such as MEDLINE and EMBASE. In the second, experts select the retrieved abstracts that are most likely to meet the inclusion criteria (abstract triage step). In the next step, the experts closely read the selected articles, classify the articles as inclusion or exclusion in the SR using pre-specified eligibility criteria (full text triage step), and assess quality of inclusion articles. Finally, if included articles are sufficiently similar, their results are synthesized.The new Health Technology Assessment (nHTA) center in the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency assesses new medical technologies introduced into Korean healthcare markets. It evaluates the safety and effectiveness of new medical technologies in real clinical settings. It systematically reviews all evidence relevant to the evaluation of those technologies. To date, 126 evidence reports have been completed and published [7].The scientific literature is growing extremely fast (500,000 new abstracts are added to Medline every year), but only a minority of trials have been suggested in SRs [4,8]. The Cochrane Collaboration, which coordinates the creation and update of SRs, estimates that at least 10,000 reviews are needed to cover a substantial proportion of the studies relevant to health care [9]. However, creating a new SR or updating an existing one takes considerable time and effort. Using current methods, we have not been able to cover new issues and keep even half of existing reviews up-to-date [10]. We need to reduce avoidable processes in the production of research evidence [11]. Advanced information technologies can be developed and implemented to support SRs by reducing the labor required while still capturing high-quality evidence [4].Researchers conducting SRs try to provide a more precise estimate and reduce uncertainty aimed at minimizing bias [5]. To produce more reliable findings, they exclude studies having high risk of biases (i.e., opinion pieces). In this study, we divided exclusion articles of the SRs into two parts: common and topic-specific. Common exclusion articles cannot be included in any SRs, because their results are definitely biased. Topic-specific articles can be included or excluded in SRs according to the topics. We hypothesize that by using commonly excluded articles across all SRs, we can automatically classify rigorous articles with better results than previous works. We propose a method that creates classifiers through training on articles that are included and commonly excluded.
