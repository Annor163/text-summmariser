@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Personal authentication based on palmprint features has been attracting extensive attention currently. In many palmprint based recognition approaches, major issue is textural analysis of palm. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient texture based approach to palmprint recognition based on a 2D discrete orthonormal S-Transform called as the 2D-DOST. 2D-DOST is a new powerful tool for texture analysis which has been introduced in recent years. It can efficiently characterize the frequency contribution of image texture in the various bandwidths. In this work, First, 2D-DOST is applied to the palmprint to characterize the frequency content of palmprint texture. Palmprint features are obtained by computing the local energy of 2D-DOST magnitudes in different bandwidths. Then, ICA will be employed to the extracted features to reduce the dimensionality and eliminate the redundant features. The experimental results offer EER equal to 0.93%, 0.97% and 0.12% for IITD, CASIA and PolyU databases, respectively. The results demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To date, personal authentication based on biometric systems play an important role in the human daily life. In general, biometric systems identify a person using physical characteristics, such as fingerprint, iris, face, palmprint and ear, or behavioral characteristics, such as signature, gait and keystroke [1]. Amongst the biometric-based identification approaches, methods based on palmprint have currently been attracting more attention. Palmprint based techniques utilize the information extracted from inner surface of palm to recognize a person. Compared with the other biometric systems, palmprint based recognition approaches have many advantages, such as low-resolution imaging, low cost, stable structural features and high user acceptance.In general, palmprint based recognition approaches include three major categories: line-based, subspace-based and texture-based approaches [2]. Line based approaches, which also called structural based approaches, employ a set of structural features of palmprints such as principle lines, wrinkles, datum points, ridges and crease points. These approaches either develop edge detectors or use the existing edge detection methods to extract palm lines [3]. Wu et al. used Sobel masks to compute the magnitude of palm lines [4]. In [5], datum points of the palmprins are used as features. Datum points are defined as end points of the principle lines. Han et al. proposed a palmprint based system which uses Sobel masks and morphologic operators to extract the structural features of palmprint [6]. In [7], Canny edge operator is used to extract the palm lines. In general, line-based approaches can successfully extracts the majority of lines and ridges correctly. However, the high complexity of these methods is the main drawback in using line based approaches. Besides, a significant computational power is required to determine and match the line segments.Subspace-based approaches utilize numerous techniques such as principle component analysis (PCA) [8], Fisherpalm [9], and independent component analysis (ICA) [10] to extract the palmprint features. These approaches also called appearance-based approach in the literature of face recognition [3]. Subspace-based approaches do not make use of any prior knowledge of palmprints. Lu et al. proposed an approach based on the PCA to extract the palm features [8]. They used the Karhunen-loeve transform to project the original image into a small set of feature space called ‘eigenpalms’. In [9], Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) is used to project the original palmprint images into the lower dimensional feature space called ‘Fisherpalm space’. In another approach, ICA is employed to extract the palm features [10]. In general, these approaches are more computational effective but suffer from dependency to the training data sets.In texture based approaches, texture can be defined as the spatial relationship of pixel values in an image region [11]. Some interesting techniques to analyze the palmprint texture are Gabor filters [12,13], discrete cosines transform (DCT) [14,15], morphological techniques [16], Fourier Transform [17] and wavelet Transforms [18–24]. Zhang et al. used Gabor filters to extract the palm features [12]. They called these features as Palmcodes. In [13], Palmcodes in varying direction are fused to present the features which are called Fusioncode. In [14], DCT is used to extract the palmrint and face features. Meraoumia et al. proposed a method to use two dimensional Block based Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-BDCT) [15]. They divided a palmprint into overlapping and equal-sized blocks and applied DCT over each block. Han et al. proposed a method based on the morphological operator to extract the palmprint features [16]. In [18–22], palmprint features are extracted by using various families of Wavelet transform. In general, texture based methods have strong mathematical foundations and fast implementations which make them suitable for palmprint authentication applications.Recently, wavelet transform has been widely used in texture based palmprint recognition approaches. 2D wavelet transform is a powerful tool in texture analysis which provides a multi-resolution representation of image. In the uni-modal biometric systems, wavelet transform is used to characterize the palmprint features. In [18], the wavelet energy features are defined for palmprint representation and the performance of the proposed system has been analyzed for different wavelets. Zhang et al. defined a set of statistical signatures for palmprint classification [19]. Accordingly, wavelet transform is applied to palmprint image and the directional context of each wavelet sub-band is computed. Then, a set of statistical signatures, which includes density, spatial dispersivity, gravity center and energy, is defined to characterize the palmprint. In [20], sequential modified haar transform is applied to palmprint image to compute the modified haar energy features. Zhang et al. proposed an image similarity metric called ‘complex wavelet structural similarity index’ for palmprint classification [21]. In [22], the information extracted from multiple wavelets is combined using the fusion at feature level. On the other hand, some other approaches utilized wavelet transform for extracting the palmprint and fingerprint features. Yang et al. introduced a biometric verification system based on fingerprint, palmprint and hand geometry [23]. In this system, palmprint and fingerprint features are extracted by using the discrete wavelet transform and integrated by fusion at feature level. Then, the integrated textural features are combined with hand geometry features by means of the fusion at matching score level. In [24], Lu et al. applied wavelet zero-crossing for representing the 1D fingerprint and palmprint features. Although, these approaches employed wavelet based techniques for efficient authentication systems, their performance are highly dependent on the type of wavelet transform. Therefore, how to choose the suitable wavelet transform is a critical issue in some wavelet based approaches [18].S-Transform (ST) is a new powerful tool for texture analysis which has been introduced in recent years. This transform is a time-frequency spectral localization technique which closely related to the continuous wavelet transform [11,25]. In fact, ST is defined as a combination of short-time Fourier (STFT) and wavelet transforms, since it uses complex Fourier basis functions, modulated by frequency-dependent Gaussian function. Therefore, this transform provides time-frequency representation and multi-resolution analysis like wavelet, although maintains a direct link with Fourier spectrum [25]. The advantage of S-Transform is that it preserves the phase information, uses a linear frequency scale and can be easily inverted to recover the Fourier domain of a signal [11].The one-dimensional S-Transform is successfully applied for signal analyzing in various applications. Badrinath et al. proposed a method based on S-Transform to extract the instantaneous-phase features of the palmprint [26]. In this approach, the palm-print is segmented into overlapping circular-strips and then instantaneous-phase of each circular-strip is computed by ST. The instantaneous-phase differences along the vertically adjacent circular strips are computed. The obtained results are regarded as palmprint feature vector. However, extensive processing time and large amount of memory usage are the main drawbacks in using S-Transform for texture analysis of 2D images. For example, S-Transform of a 256×256 image requires approximately 1.5h of computation time and 32 gigabyte of memory [11]. To resolve this problem, Stockwell proposed an approach based on Discrete, Orthonormal S-Transform (DOST) [27]. In this approach, the redundancy of the S-Transform is addressed by using an orthogonal set of the basic function. Drabycz et al. proposed an approach based on the 2D-DOST for texture characterization [11]. Accordingly, the DOST is calculated by partitioning the frequency domain in a dyadic sampling schema. The proposed DOST accelerates the calculation and eliminates the redundancy in the space-frequency domain due to its dyadic sampling schema. Drabycz et al. showed that DOST can be successfully used for texture classification by computing the local spatial frequency content of each pixel in an image.One of the advantages of S-Transform over wavelet is to avoid the requirement of testing various families of wavelets to detect the best transform for a higher performance [25]. A few approaches have been proposed based on the S-Transform in 2D image analysis in last decade. On the other hand, S-Transform suffers from a high computational time and large amount of memory usage. To tackle this problem, 2D-DOST is proposed for extracting the frequency contribution of palmprint texture in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, there has not any study of using 2D-DOST on palmprint. This has motivated us to investigate the capabilities of DOST in the field of palmprint texture analysis. In this paper, a novel approach based on 2D-DOST is presented to analyze the palmprint texture. First, 2D-DOST is applied to palmprint image to characterize the frequency content of palmprint in the certain frequency bandwidths. Then, DOST energy features are obtained by computing the local energy of 2D-DOST magnitudes. Finally, the extracted features are compared using a similarity/dissimilarity measures. In this work, the performance of 2D-DOST based method is evaluated by six different similarity/dissimilarity measures. Also, three different datasets, including PolyU, CASIA and IITD datasets, have been tested to evaluate the validity and efficiency of the method. Finally, we will show how the proposed method is proper for real time identification and verification purposes.The rest of the paper organized as follow. In Section 2, ST and DOST are reviewed briefly. Section 3 gives an overview of the proposed method. The experimental results are discussed in Section 4, and finally conclusion is presented in Section 5.S-Transform was first proposed by Stockwell in 1996 to analyze the seismic signals [28]. The ST has been successfully applied for signal analysis in various applications, including seismic recordings, ground vibrations, gravitational waves and power system analysis [11].The ST can be considered as the “phase correction” of the CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) [28]. The ST of a function h(t) is defined as a CWT with a specific mother wavelet multiplied by the phase factor.(1)S(τ,f)=exp(i2πfτ)W(τ,d)where the mother wavelet is defined for this particular case as(2)w(t,f)=f2πexp−t2f22⋅exp(−i2πft)Note that the scale parameter d is the inverse of the frequency f and W(t, f) is the CWT of the function h(τ). The wavelet in Eq. (2) does not satisfy the zero mean condition for an admissible wavelet; therefore, Eq. (1) is not strictly a CWT. consequently, the final form of the continuous ST is obtained by Eq. (3)(3)S(τ,f)=∫−∞∞h(t)f2πexp−(τ−t)2f22⋅exp(−i2πft)dtwhere τ and t are time variables. The τ and f present as time-point and frequency, respectively. The inverse of ST can be easily obtained as follow(4)h(t)=∫−∞∞∫−∞∞S(τ,f)dτexp(i2πft)dfIf h[kT] (k=0, 1, 2,…,N−1) is the series of sampling time for a continuous signal h(t), with time sampling interval and sampling number equal to T and N, then the Discrete Fourier Transform is given by [25](5)HnNT=1N∑k=0N−1h(kT)exp−i2πnkNn=0,1,…,N−1.The ST of a discrete time series h[kT] is given by (letting f→n/NT and τ→j T)(6)SjT,nNT=∑m=0N−1Hm+nNTexp−2π2m2n2⋅expi2πmkNfor n=0, it is equal to the constant value defined as:(7)SjT,0=1N∑m=0N−1hmNTwhere j, m and n=0, 1,…,N−1. Eq. (7) puts the constant average of the time series into the zero frequency voice, thus assuring that the inverse is exact.Significant computational time and storage requirement are the main limitations in ST which restrict the utilization of the ST-based approaches in wider applications of texture analysis. However, the redundant nature of the ST-based algorithms brings these limitations. The DOST addresses the redundancy of the ST by using an orthogonal set of basic functions. In [27], DOST for 1D-signals has been described.The 2D-DOST of a N×N image h[x,y] is found by partitioning the 2D-FT of the image, H[m,n], multiplying by the square root of the number of points in the partition, and performing an inverse 2D-FT [11],(8)Sx′,y′,vx,vy=12px+py−2∑m=−2px−22px−2−1∑n=−2py−22py−2−1H[m+vx,n+vy]exp2πimx′2px−1+ny′2py−1where H[m,n] presents the Fourier Transform of the function h(x,y). Here,vx=2px−1+2px−2andvy=2py−1+2py−2are defined as the horizontal and vertical “voice frequencies”.The process of calculating the inverse transform for 2D-DOST is similar to the 1-D described in [27]. For this reason, the spectrum of the image is reconstructed by applying the forward 2D-FFT to each ‘voice’.(9)H[m,n]=2px+py−2∑m=−2px−22px−2−1∑n=−2py−22py−2S[m−vx,n−vy]⋅exp−2πimx′′2px−1+ny′′2py−1Then, the image then will be recovered by performing an inverse FT:(10)h[x,y]=1N2∑m=−N/2N/2−1∑n=−N/2N/2−1H[m,n]⋅exp2πi(mx+ny)NTake into account that although the DOST in Eq. (8), like the DWT, uses a dyadic sampling schema (pxand pyorders=0, 1, 2,…,log2N−1), as illustrated in Fig. 1, two transforms produce different information about the frequency content of an image [11]. The DWT provides the information about image details in horizontal, vertical and diagonal direction for each scale, while the DOST gives the information about the voice frequencies (vx, vy) in bandwidth of 2px−1×2py−1 frequencies. While, the DWT decomposes an image into the size of M×M, the DOST utilizes the minimum number of points required to describe the magnitude of a Fourier frequency component in horizontal and vertical directions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the field of hand biometric recognition, the methods based on the palmprint texture have been widely undertaken by research groups. In this regard, various techniques such as Gabor filter, Fourier transform, DCT and Wavelet transform are employed. The DOST is a new powerful tool for signal and texture analysis which has been introduced in recent years. This transform, which is closely related to the wavelet transform, is able to effectively extract the frequency contribution of signal and image texture. In this paper, 2D discrete orthonormal S-Transform called as the 2D-DOST is introduced for extracting the frequency contribution of palmprint texture. In the proposed method, the energy of vertical and horizontal voice frequencies of palmprint is used for extracting the textural features of the palmprint. First, 2D-DOST is employed to the palmprint image for characterizing the frequency content of palmprint in different frequency bandwidths. Then, energy features are obtained by computing the local energy of 2D-DOST magnitudes. The performance of 2D-DOST method has been evaluated based on a set of different similarity/dissimilarity measures. In the experiments, CASIA, PolyU and IITD databases have been used to evaluate the performance of the system. Although the utilization of 2D-DOST on palmprint identification and verification is new, the results on different standard data sets are promising. The experimental results show that the recognition rate for PolyU, CASIA and IITD databases are 100%, 98.44% and 97.29% with the EER equal to 0.121%, 0.973% and 0.933%, respectively. These results demonstrate that 2D-DOST is able to discriminate palmprints effectively. The experimental results on different data sets indicate that the total time of feature extraction and palm print matching is less than 0.4 second which is fast enough for real time identification and verification purposes.In conclusion, the main key-points of this work are as follows:•In this work, the 2D-DOST is used for extracting the palmprint features for the first time. The proposed method is based on 2D-DOST to characterize the frequency contribution of palmprint texture in the various frequency bandwidths. The experimental results of proposed method indicate that 2D-DOST is particularly suitable for extracting the texture features of the palmprint due to its linear frequency scale and its close relation with the wavelet transform.The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated based on the different similarity/dissimilarity measures which among them, normalized correlation yields the best results due to the relation with the nature of feature extraction based method. Also, high performance of the 2D-DOST for all measurements demonstrates the ability of the method with no regard to the matching technique.The experiments have been performed on three databases with different illumination conditions, resolution and capturing device. Obtaining the EER less than 1% for all databases illustrate the efficiency and the validity of 2D-DOST method with no dependency to the environmental conditions.In the future work, more improvement of the accuracy of the proposed method is planned by using some more efficient feature extractors or classifiers. Note that in the proposed method, the simple feature extractor and similarity measurements are accomplished. Therefore, selecting a feature extraction or classification schema according to the characterization of DOST, will increases the accuracy of method. Furthermore, we plan to combine the textural features obtained by the proposed method with the geometrical features of hand to enhance the accuracy of approach.
