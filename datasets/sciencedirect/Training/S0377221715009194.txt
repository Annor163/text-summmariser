@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we consider the online strip packing problem, in which a list of online rectangles has to be packed without overlap or rotation into a strip of width 1 and infinite length so as to minimize the required height of the packing. We derive a new improved lower bound of(3+5)/2≈2.618for the competitive ratio for this problem. This result improves the best known lower bound of 2.589.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we consider online strip packing of rectangles. Rectangles arrive one by one in an online fashion and have to be packed into a strip of width 1 and infinite length without known any information about future rectangles. The rectangles must be packed without overlap and rotation and couldn’t be moved when they are already packed. The objective is to minimize the total height of the packing. The strip packing problem was first considered by Baker, Coffman, and Rivest (1980). They showed that this problem isNP−Hard. Strip packing has many real-world applications in manufacturing, logistics, and computer science, e.g., VLSI layout design, stock cutting problem.To evaluate the performance of an online algorithm we adopt competitive analysis. For any list of rectangles L, the height of a strip used by algorithm A and by the optimal solution is denoted by A(L) and OPT(L), respectively. The (absolute) competitive ratio of A, denoted by RA, is given byRA=supL{A(L)OPT(L)}.The asymptotic competitive ratioRA∞of A is defined byRA∞=limsupn→∞supL{A(L)OPT(L)|OPT(L)=n}.For the offline strip packing problem, Coffman, Garey, Johnson, and Tarjan (1980) presented the algorithms NFDH and FFDH with asymptotic competitive ratios of 2 and 1.7, respectively. An AFPTAS was given by Kenyon and Rémila (2000). Sleator (1980) presented an approximation algorithm with an absolute competitive ratio of 2.5. This was independently improved by Schiermeyer (1994) and Steinberg (1997) with algorithms of absolute competitive ratio 2. Harren and van Stee (2009) first broke the barrier of 2 and presented an algorithm with a absolute competitive ratio of 1.936. Then this bound was improved to5/3+ɛfor any ε > 0 by Harren, Jansen, Prädel, and van Stee (2014).For the online strip packing problem, Baker and Schwarz (1983) showed the first fit shelf algorithm has absolute competitive ratio of 6.99. The upper bound was improved to7/2+10≈6.6623by Ye, Han, and Zhang (2009) and Hurink and Paulus (2007) independently. Regarding the lower bound on the competitive ratio for online strip packing, Brown, Baker, and Katseff (1982) derived a lower bound ρ ≥ 2 on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm by constructing adversary sequences (BBK sequences). Then Johannes (2006) and Hurink and Paulus (2008) improved the bound to 2.25 and 2.43 by studying BBK sequences. Kern and Paulus (2013) finally showed that the BBK sequences can be packed by providing matching upper and lower bounds of3/2+33/6≈2.457.The current best known result ρ ≥ 2.589 was presented by Harren and Kern (2015) by constructing modified BBK sequences.A related problem is the multiple-strip packing problem. Zhuk (2006) first considered this problem and showed that there is no approximation algorithm with absolute competitive ratio better than 2 unlessP=NPeven if there are only two strips. Latter Ye, Han, and Zhang (2011) presented a nearly optimal algorithm with an absolute competitive ratio of2+ɛfor any ε > 0. Then Bougeret, Dutot, Jansen, Otte, and Trystram (2010) presented an approximation algorithm with absolute competitive ratio of 2, which is the best possible unlessP=NP. For the online multiple-strip packing problem, Ye et al. (2011) designed both randomized and deterministic online algorithms with competitive ratios better than the previous bound 10 presented by Zhuk (2006).In this section, we first describe the construction of new modified BBK sequencesLn=(J1,…,Ji,…)in order to get a new lower bound for the competitive ratio of online strip packing, where each item Jidenotes a rectangle of height Jiand width w(Ji). In the end of this section, we will give the reason why we design this type of our sequences.Assume that there exists aρ−competitive online algorithm A withρ<(3+5)/2. Since Brown et al. (1982) derived a lower bound 2, we suppose that ρ > 2 in the following. We can define Lnas the list of items(P1,s1,…,sk,R1,P2,F2,R2,…,Pn−1,Fn−1,Rn−1,Pn).The sequences Lnconsist of four types of rectangles:Pi, si, Ri, Fi. For any i, Piand Riare thin items with small widths. Riis special in Ln, because it may not appear in Ln. For any i, Riis included in the sequence only if the online algorithm A satisfies some conditions which we will state in the following. For any i, siis a rectangle with small height and near-full width. After the online algorithm A packed the rectangle P1,s1,…,si,…arrived online and may be packed either below P1 or above P1. When the first rectangle si(denoted by sk) is packed above P1, new sidoesn’t arrive. For any i ≥ 2, Fiis a block item with the full width of 1. For convenience, skis also said to be F1, i.e.sk=F1.We can describe the sequences Ln(see Fig. 1) with•P1=1,w(P1)=δ0si=θ+ɛ,w(si)=1−δifori=1,…,k;Ri=(ρ−1)(xi+Pi+yi)ρ+ɛfori=1,…,n−1;Pi=(xi−1+Pi−1+yi−1)+ɛfori=2,…,n;F2=max{min{x1−∑i=1k−1si,P2ρ},min{y1,P2ρ},x2}+ɛ;Fi=max{min{yi−1,Piρ},Fi−1,xi}+ɛfori=3,…,n−1.The value ε is a small positive value andθ=−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1)2(Note that θ > 0 ifρ<(3+5)/2). The value δ0 is a positive number no more than12n−1andδi=δi−14nfori=1,…,k. For i ≥ 2,w(Ri−1)=w(Pi)=2δkandw(Fi)=1. The value x1 denotes the distance between P1 and the bottom of the strip, and xidenotes the distance betweenFi−1and Pifori=2,…,n. The value y1 denotes the distance between P1 and sk,and yidenotes the distance between Piand Fifori=2,…,n−1.Fori=1,R1 is included in the sequence if the following condition holds: eitherx1−∑i=1k−1si>P2ρory1>P2ρ(Note that the condition indicates thatx1+y1>P2ρ,i.e.x1+y1>P1ρ−1.). For i ≥ 2, Riis included in the sequence ifxi+yi>Piρ−1. In the next section, we will show that Rimust be packed below Fiif the competitive ratio of A is less than(3+5)/2.The sole function of the positive number ε is to ensure the structure of any online packing. For convenience, we assume that ε is small enough to be omitted from the analysis.We now show that Fishould be packed above Pifor i ≥ 2. Fori=2,if R1 is included in the sequence which means eitherx1−∑i=1k−1si>P2ρory1>P2ρ,thenF2≥P2ρ. Thusx1+P1+y1−R1=x1+P1+y1ρ=P2ρ≤F2which means F2 couldn't be packed below sk. Since F2 ≥ x2, the online algorithm A must pack F2 above P2. If R1 is not included in the sequence, thenx1−(s1+⋯+sk−1)≤P2ρandy1≤P2ρ. Thus,F2=max{x1−∑i=1k−1si,y1,x2}which means F2 should be packed above P2. For i ≥ 3, ifRi−1is included in the sequence, letbi−1be the distance betweenRi−1andFi−1,thenbi−1≤xi−1+Pi−1+yi−1−Ri−1=xi−1+Pi−1+yi−1ρ=Piρ. SoFi=max{min{yi−1,Piρ},Fi−1,xi}≥max{min{yi−1,bi−1},Fi−1,xi}which means Fishould be packed above Pi. IfRi−1is not included in the sequence, thenyi−1≤Piρ(note thatxi−1+yi−1≤Pi−1ρ−1indicatesyi−1≤Piρ). SoFi=max{min{yi−1,Piρ},Fi−1,xi}=max{yi−1,Fi−1,xi}which also means Fishould be packed above Pi.For the list(J1,…,Ji),let A(Ji) denote the height of the packing by the algorithm A and OPT(Ji) denote the height of the optimal off-line packing. It is not difficult to determine OPT(Jj). We list them in the following (see Fig. 2):•OPT(P1)=1;OPT(si)=P1+∑j=1isjfori=1,…,k;OPT(R1)=P1+∑j=1ksjorOPT(R1)=R1+sk;OPT(Pi)=Pi+∑j=1i−1Fjfor i ≥ 2;OPT(Fi)=Pi+∑j=1iFjfor i ≥ 2;OPT(Ri)=Ri+∑j=1iFjfor i ≥ 2.Now we will show the reason why we design this type of sequences after we give two definitions. We define Githrough(1)A(Pi)+Gi=ρ·OPT(Pi).With similar methods as in the literature (Harren & Kern, 2015), we define a potential function Φito obtain a contradiction which is defined by(2)Φi=xi+GiPi.In the process of studying Φi, we found that Φihas no good rule for the basic BBK sequences (i.e. only Piand Fiare included in the sequences Ln). But, if Φ2 and Fiare small enough, then Φihas a good rule, that is,Φi+1−Φiis less than a negative constant. In order to ensure that Φ2 is small enough, we need to reduce F1 if it is relatively large. We use a series of siof small height and near-full width instead of F1 in our new BBK sequences. The special structure of siguarantees the effect of sk(i.e. the first rectangle sipacked above P1) is similar to that of F1(So skis also said to be F1 in this paper) and skhas the advantage that skis smaller than F1. Now we need to reduce Fifori=2,…,n−1if it is relatively large. If a suitable rectangle(i.e. Ri) with height larger than Pican be packed betweenFi−1and Fi(F0 refers to the bottom of the strip), thenFi+1may be smaller than its original value. In order to make sure that Rican be packed betweenFi−1and Fi, we design the proper value ofRi=(ρ−1)(xi+Pi+yi)ρ. This value can also ensure that the gap between RiandFi−1and the gap between Riand Fiwill not exceed(xi+Pi+yi)−Ri=xi+Pi+yiρ=Pi+1ρ. This is the reason whyFi(i=2,…,n−1)has the above definition.In this section, we will show that the potential function Φidecreases to be negative contradicting the fact that Φi≥ 0.Lemma 3.1yi≤Gi+(ρ−1)Fifor i ≥ 2.The online algorithm A is by assumptionρ−competitive after packing rectangle Fi, which meansA(Fi)≤ρ·OPT(Fi).ThusA(Pi)+yi+Fi≤ρ·(OPT(Pi)+Fi),i.e.,yi≤Gi+(ρ−1)Fi.□For i ≥ 2,xi+1+Gi+1=Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+(ρ−1)Pi+1−ρPi−yi.SinceGi+1=ρ·OPT(Pi+1)−A(Pi+1),A(Pi+1)=A(Pi)+yi+Fi+xi+1+Pi+1andOPT(Pi+1)=OPT(Pi)+Fi+(Pi+1−Pi),we havexi+1+Gi+1=xi+1+ρ·OPT(Pi+1)−A(Pi+1)=xi+1+ρ·[OPT(Pi)+Fi+(Pi+1−Pi)]−[A(Pi)+yi+Fi+xi+1+Pi+1]=(ρ·OPT(Pi)−A(Pi))+(ρ−1)Fi+(ρ−1)Pi+1−ρPi−yi=Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+(ρ−1)Pi+1−ρPi−yi.□By (2) and Lemma 3.2, we get the following conclusion.Lemma 3.3For i ≥ 2,Φi+1=(ρ−1)+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi−ρPi−yiPi+1.Now we show that Ricouldn't be packed above Fiby the following lemmas.Lemma 3.4If R1is included in the sequence, then it must be packed below sk.If the online algorithm A packs R1 above Sk, thenOPT(R1)=P1+s1+⋯+skorOPT(R1)=R1+sk. Let z1 denote the distance between skand R1, we have (see Fig. 3)x1+P1+y1+sk+z1+R1≤ρ·OPT(R1).For the caseOPT(R1)=P1+s1+⋯+sk,thenR1≤P1+s1+⋯+sk−1≤P1+x1sincesi(i=1,…,k−1)is placed between P1 and the bottom of the strip. Ify1>P2ρ=x1+P1+y1ρ,theny1>1ρ−1(x1+P1).ThusR1=(ρ−1)(x1+P1+y1)ρ>ρ−1ρ(x1+P1+1ρ−1(x1+P1))=P1+x1,contradictingR1≤P1+x1.Soy1≤P2ρ. Since R1 is not included in the sequence ifx1−(s1+⋯+sk−1)≤P2ρandy1≤P2ρ,we havex1−(s1+⋯+sk−1)>P2ρ. Thenx1+P1+y1+sk+z1+R1≤ρ·(P1+s1+⋯+sk−1+sk)<ρ·(P1+x1−P2ρ+sk)=ρ·(P1+x1−x1+P1+y1ρ+sk)=(ρ−1)(P1+x1)−y1+ρ·sk.Hence, we havez1≤(ρ−2)(P1+x1)−2y1−R1+(ρ−1)sk≤(ρ−2−ρ−1ρ)(P1+x1)+(ρ−1)sk=ρ2−3ρ+1ρ(P1+x1)+(ρ−1)sk≤ρ2−3ρ+1ρ·1+(ρ−1)−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1)2=(ρ−2)(ρ2−3ρ+1)2ρ(ρ−1)<0.For the caseOPT(R1)=R1+sk,withR1=ρ−1ρ(x1+P1+y1)>ρ−1ρ(1ρ−1P1+P1)=P1=1,we havez1≤(ρ−1)R1−(x1+P1+y1)+(ρ−1)sk=(ρ−1)R1−ρρ−1R1+(ρ−1)sk=ρ2−3ρ+1ρ−1R1+(ρ−1)sk<ρ2−3ρ+1ρ−1·1+(ρ−1)−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1)2=ρ2−3ρ+12(ρ−1)<0.Then we derive a contradiction to z1 ≥ 0.□In the following, we denoteα=(ρ−1)θ=−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1).Lemma 3.5For i ≥ 2, if Ri is included in the sequence andΦi≤(ρ−2)+αandFiPi≤(ρ−2)+α,then Ri must be packed betweenFi−1and Fi.SinceRi=ρ−1ρ(xi+Pi+yi)>ρ−1ρ(1ρ−1Pi+Pi)=Pi,then Ricouldn't be packed belowFi−1. We will show that Ricouldn’t be packed above Fieither.If Riis packed above Fi, let zidenote the distance between Fiand Ri, thenA(Pi)+yi+Fi+zi+Ri≤ρ·(OPT(Pi)+Fi+Ri−Pi)(see Fig. 4). Thuszi≤(ρ·OPT(Pi)−A(Pi))+(ρ−1)Fi+(ρ−1)Ri−ρPi−yi=Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+(ρ−1)·ρ−1ρ(xi+Pi+yi)−ρPi−yi<Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+xi−(ρ−1)Pias(ρ−1)2ρ<1=(xi+Gi)+(ρ−1)Fi−(ρ−1)Pi≤(ρ−2+α)Pi+(ρ−1)(ρ−2+α)Pi−(ρ−1)Pi=(ρ2−3ρ+1+ρα)Pi=(ρ2−3ρ+1+ρ·−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1))Pi=(ρ−2)(ρ2−3ρ+1)2(ρ−1)Pi<0.Then we derive a contradiction to zi≥ 0.□Φ2≤(ρ−2)+α.WithA(P2)+G2=ρ·OPT(P2)andP2=x1+P1+y1,we havex1+P1+y1+sk+x2+P2+G2=ρ·(P2+sk)(see Fig. 5). Thenx2+G2=(ρ−2)P2+(ρ−1)sk=(ρ−2)P2+(ρ−1)θ.SinceP2≥P1=1,we getΦ2=(ρ−2)+(ρ−1)θP2≤(ρ−2)+(ρ−1)θ=(ρ−2)+α.□F2P2≤ρ−2+αandF2P3≤1ρ.IfF2=x2,thenF2P2=x2P2≤Φ2≤ρ−2+αandF2P3=x2x2+P2+y2≤x2x2+P2≤Φ2·P2Φ2·P2+P2=Φ2Φ2+1≤ρ−2+αρ−1+α=ρ2−3ρ+3ρ2−ρ+1<1ρ.If F2 ≠ x2, thenF2=max{min{x1−∑i=1k−1si,P2ρ},min{y1,P2ρ}}≤P2ρ.Thus,F2P2≤1ρ<ρ−2+αandF2P3≤F2P2≤1ρ.□Φ3<ρ−2.By lemma 3.3 we getΦ3=(ρ−1)+G2+(ρ−1)F2−ρP2−y2P3=(ρ−1)+G2+(ρ−1)F2−ρP2−y2x2+P2+y2.Consider the derivative with respect to y2 we get∂Φ3∂y2=(ρ−1)P2−(x2+G2+(ρ−1)F2)(x2+P2+y2)2>0asx2+G2≤(ρ−2+α)P2andF2P2≤ρ−2+α.Thus, we haveΦ3≤(ρ−1)+G2+(ρ−1)F2−ρP2−(G2+(ρ−1)F2)x2+P2+(G2+(ρ−1)F2)=(ρ−1)−ρP2x2+G2+(ρ−1)F2+P2=(ρ−1)−ρΦ2+(ρ−1)F2P2+1≤(ρ−1)−ρρ−2+α+(ρ−1)(ρ−2+α)+1=(ρ−1)−ρ(ρ−1)2+ρα<ρ−2.The last step holds asα=−ρ2+3ρ−12(ρ−1)<−ρ2+3ρ−1ρ.□For i ≥ 3, ifΦi≤ρ−2andFi−1Pi≤1ρ,thenΦi+1−Φi≤βandFiPi+1≤1ρ,whereβ=ρ2−3ρ+12ρ−1<0.By Lemma 3.3 we getΦi+1−Φi=(ρ−1)+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi−ρPi−yixi+Pi+yi−Φi.Consider the derivative with respect to yiwe get∂∂yi(Φi+1−Φi)=(ρ−1)Pi−(xi+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi)(xi+Pi+yi)2as∂Φi∂yi=0for yidoes not affect Φi.Now we show that∂∂yi(Φi+1−Φi)>0andΦi+1−Φi≤βfor i ≥ 3 by case distinction on the way that Fiis determined.Case 1:Fi=xi.SinceΦi≤ρ−2,we havexi+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi=ρxi+Gi≤ρ(xi+Gi)=ρΦiPi≤ρ(ρ−2)Pi<(ρ−1)Pi. Then∂∂yi(Φi+1−Φi)>0. Hence(*1)Φi+1−Φi≤(ρ−1)+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi−ρPi−(Gi+(ρ−1)Fi)xi+Pi+(Gi+(ρ−1)Fi)−Φi=(ρ−1)−ρPixi+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+Pi−Φi=(ρ−1)−ρPiρxi+Gi+Pi−Φi≤(ρ−1)−ρPiρ(xi+Gi)+Pi−Φi≤(ρ−1)−ρρΦi+1−Φi≤(ρ−1)−ρρ(ρ−2)+1−(ρ−2)=ρ2−3ρ+1(ρ−1)2.The inequality (*1) holds asΦi≤ρ−2and∂∂Φi((ρ−1)−ρρΦi+1−Φi)=ρ2(ρΦi+1)2−1≥ρ2(ρ(ρ−2)+1)2−1=(ρ(ρ−1)2)2−1>0.Case 2: Fi≠ xi.IfFi=Fi−1,thenFiPi=Fi−1Pi≤1ρ. IfFi≠Fi−1,thenFiPi=min{yi−1,Piρ}Pi≤PiρPi=1ρ. So we havexi+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi=ΦiPi+(ρ−1)Fi≤(ρ−2)Pi+ρ−1ρPi<(ρ−1)PisinceΦi≤ρ−2. Thus∂∂yi(Φi+1−Φi)>0when Fi≠ xi. Hence(*2)Φi+1−Φi≤(ρ−1)+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi−ρPi−(Gi+(ρ−1)Fi)xi+Pi+(Gi+(ρ−1)Fi)−Φi=(ρ−1)−ρPixi+Gi+(ρ−1)Fi+Pi−Φi=(ρ−1)−ρΦi+(ρ−1)FiPi+1−Φi≤(ρ−1)−ρΦi+ρ−1ρ+1−Φi=(ρ−1)−ρ2ρΦi+2ρ−1−Φi≤(ρ−1)−ρ22ρ−1=ρ2−3ρ+12ρ−1.The inequality (*2) holds as(ρ−1)−ρ2ρΦi+2ρ−1−Φiattains its maximum whenΦi=0since∂∂Φi((ρ−1)−ρ2ρΦi+2ρ−1−Φi)=ρ3(ρΦi+2ρ−1)2−1≤ρ3(2ρ−1)2−1<0.ThusΦi+1−Φi≤max{ρ2−3ρ+1(ρ−1)2,ρ2−3ρ+12ρ−1}=ρ2−3ρ+12ρ−1<0.It remains to show thatFiPi+1≤1ρ(see Fig. 6). IfFi=xi,thenFiPi+1=xiPi+1≤xixi+Pi≤xi+Gixi+Gi+Pi=ΦiΦi+1≤ρ−2ρ−1<1ρ.If Fi≠ xi, thenFiPi+1≤FiPi≤1ρ.□Lemma 3.7 , Lemma 3.8 and Lemma 3.9 show that the potential Φi(i ≥ 3) decreases by a constant in every step until Φibecomes a negative number. Then we derive a contradiction to Φi≥ 0 for any i. Thus we haveTheorem 3.10There exists no online algorithm for strip packing with competitive ratioρ<3+52=2.618….Theorem 4.1With the list Ln, no lower bound on the competitive ratio larger thanρ=(3+5)/2can be obtained for online strip packing.We only need to find an algorithm that its competitive ratio is ρ when presented with our modified BBK sequences Ln.Consider the online algorithm A: if the list of the online rectangles is(J1,…,Ji,…),then the online algorithm A packs J1 above the bottom of the strip and packs JiaboveJi−1for i ≥ 2; Let c1 denote the distance between J1 and the bottom of the strip and cidenote the distance between JiandJi−1for i ≥ 2, the online algorithm A setsc2i−1=J2i−1ρ−1andc2i=0.With our list Ln, the online algorithm A choosesx1=P1ρ−1,y1=0and places s1 above P1(i.e.k=1). Sincex1+y1≤P1ρ−1(i.e.x1+y1≤P2ρ), then R1 is not included in the sequence. And so on, for i ≥ 2, the online algorithm A choosesxi=Piρ−1andyi=0,places Fiabove Pi, and Riis not included in the sequence(sincexi+yi≤Piρ−1). SoLn=(P1,s1,P2,F2,…,Pn−1,Fn−1,Pn).SinceP1=1andPi=xi−1+Pi−1+yi−1,we obtainPi=ρρ−1Pi−1=⋯=(ρρ−1)i−1P1=(ρρ−1)i−1andxi=Piρ−1=ρi−1(ρ−1)i.It is easy to see thatxi>xi−1,thenFi=xifor i ≥ 2. We show that this algorithm isρ−competitive when presented with Lnin the following way:•A(P1)=x1+P1=P1ρ−1+P1=ρρ−1andOPT(P1)=P1=1,then A(P1) < ρ · OPT(P1).A(P2)=x1+P1+s1+x2+P2=x2+2P2=P2ρ−1+2P2=2ρ−1ρ−1P2andOPT(P2)=P2+s1=P2(Note thats1=θ=0forρ=(3+5)/2), thenA(P2)=ρ·OPT(P2)since2ρ−1ρ−1=ρ.for i ≥ 3,A(Pi)=x1+x2+⋯+xi+P1+⋯+Pi+s1+F2+⋯+Fi−1=x1+x2+⋯+xi+P1+⋯+Pi+θ+x2+⋯+xi−1=x1+2(x2+⋯+xi−1)+xi+P1+⋯+Pi=1ρ−1+2ρ(ρ−1)2+⋯+2ρi−2(ρ−1)i−1+ρi−1(ρ−1)i+1+ρρ−1+⋯+(ρρ−1)i−1=1ρ−1+2((ρρ−1)i−1−ρρ−1)+1ρ−1·(ρρ−1)i−1+(ρ·(ρρ−1)i−1−(ρ−1))=(2+1ρ−1+ρ)(ρρ−1)i−1+(1ρ−1−2ρρ−1−(ρ−1))=2ρ·(ρρ−1)i−1+(−2ρ+1)as1ρ−1=ρ−2andρ2−3ρ+1=0,andOPT(Pi)=Pi+s1+F2+⋯+Fi−1=Pi+θ+x2+⋯+xi−1=ρi(ρ−1)i+ρ(ρ−1)2+⋯+ρi−2(ρ−1)i−1=ρρ−1·(ρρ−1)i−1+((ρρ−1)i−1−ρρ−1)=ρ·(ρρ−1)i−1+(−ρ+1),thenA(Pi)−ρ·OPT(Pi)=2ρ·((ρρ−1)i−1+(−2ρ+1))−ρ·(ρ·(ρρ−1)i−1+(−ρ+1))=ρ(2−ρ)(ρρ−1)i−1+ρ(−3ρ+1)<0.for any i,A(Fi)=A(Pi)+FiandOPT(Fi)=OPT(Pi)+Fi,then A(Fi) < ρ · OPT(Fi).□

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We consider the absolute competitive ratio for online strip packing, and present a new lower bound of(3+5)/2=2.618by constructing new modified BBK sequences. In addition, we show that(3+5)/2is the best lower bound which can be obtained by this type of our sequences.
