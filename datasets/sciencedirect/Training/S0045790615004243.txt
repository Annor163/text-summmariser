@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As a typical media access protocol, S-MAC has drawn much attention in the past decades. However, most of the attention focuses on energy efficiency, but fails to guarantee QoS performance. Firstly, we develop one state machines model and elaborate on the states’ transition processes of S-MAC. Secondly, combining our state machines with the specific parameters of S-MAC, we propose an analytical probabilistic model to investigate the latency and stability performances of S-MAC employing three different mechanisms: without sleeping mechanism, with sleeping mechanism, and with adaptive-listening mechanism. Also we analyze the latency and stability performances of S-MAC with different dutyCycle values. This research shows two interesting results: 1) Sleeping mechanism inside S-MAC does have negative impacts on its latency and stability; fortunately, adaptive listening mechanism can optimize them to some extent. 2) Latency and stability performances of S-MAC can be further improved through manipulating dutyCycle values. The simulations in NS2 exhibit consistent results with those obtained from our analytical probabilistic model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [1] have been gaining attention all round the world and well developed. One of the top challenges for WSNs is that nodes have limited energy [2]. It should be mentioned that IEEE 802.15.4 standard [3] was proposed for low-rate wireless personal networks in 2003. It defines the physical (PHY) layer and media access control (MAC) layer specifications for low-rate wireless connectivity among relatively simple devices that consume minimal power and typically operate in the Personal Operating Space (POS) of 10 m or less [4]. A diverse set of applications for IEEE 802.15.4 networks encompassing different fields have already emerged including medicine, agriculture, environment, military, and many others [5].MAC protocol aims to distribute the consent of channel for different sensor nodes. According to different qualities of MAC protocols, wireless sensor networks can be divided into two types: TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)-based networks and contention-based networks [6]. MAC protocol allocates limited wireless channels among nodes and determines the way radio works. As a result, MAC protocol has a great influence on quality of service (QoS) capabilities of networks that are vital in designing wireless sensor networks for different applications, such as latency, packet loss rate, stability, and throughput [7-8]. Moreover, MAC protocol is one of the essential factors to reduce energy depletion of sensor nodes [9]. Therefore, the research activities in MAC protocols are necessary since sensor nodes have limited energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities [10].So far, many MAC protocols for WSNs have been proposed (e.g. PAMAS [11], S-MAC [12-13], PSIFT [14-15] QoS-MAC [16], PR-MAC [17], PQ-MAC [18] and Diff-MAC [19]). Among those notable protocols, S-MAC is representative because it is the first protocol to propose one periodical working and sleeping mechanism to avoid unnecessary energy consumption in idle listening. Afterwards, a lot of studies relevant to S-MAC are proposed successively [20-24]. Most of them aim to design different mechanisms to improve the energy efficiency of the canonical S-MAC; others try to develop QoS-oriented MAC layer protocols based on S-MAC. In the past years, there have already been some studies focusing on the analyses of S-MAC performance in a theoretical way. However, they only covered throughput and packet loss ratio under certain idealistic scenarios. It is well known that one satisfactory network service should consider the latency and stability in addition to throughput and packet loss ratio.To evaluate its latency and stability, we firstly propose one state machines model for S-MAC. Each condition of states’ transition processes is described in detail by use of the state machines model. Then, based on this state machines model and specific parameters of S-MAC, we propose an analytical probabilistic model to investigate the latency and stability performances of three different S-MAC mechanisms: without sleeping mechanism, with sleeping mechanism, and with adaptive-listening mechanism. Also we analyze the latency and stability performances of S-MAC protocol with different values of dutyCycle. The results indicate that the sleeping mechanism degrades the latency and stability performances of S-MAC. However, an adaptive listening mechanism can help in improving the performances of latency and stability. For S-MAC with adaptive listening, the appropriate dutyCycle manipulation contributes to an improvement in its latency and stability performances. Moreover, based on IEEE 802.15.4 physical standard, we conduct two simulations in line-shape and cross-shape topologies with different MAC mechanisms and dutyCycle values using NS2.35. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical probabilistic model is convincingly proved by simulations.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the related work is presented in Section 2. Section 3 introduces state machines model of S-MAC and state transition processes. In Section 4, the performances of different S-MAC mechanisms are investigated based on analytical probabilistic model. The simulations results are elaborated in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
