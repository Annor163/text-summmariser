@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Among key design practices which contribute to the development of inclusive ICT products and services is user testing with people with disabilities. Traditionally, this involves partial or minimal user testing through the usage of standard heuristics, employing external assisting devices, and the direct feedback of impaired users. However, efficiency could be improved if designers could readily analyse the needs of their target audience. The VERITAS framework simulates and systematically analyses how users with various impairments interact with the use of ICT products and services. Findings show that the VERITAS framework is useful to designers, offering an intuitive approach to inclusive design.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Designing software and products with accessibility requirements in mind entails that designers should include these from the outset–or at least, in the early stages–of the design process. This is especially important given the significant proportion of people who have some form of cognitive, motor, or sensory impairment, whether these be on a temporary or permanent basis [2,36,40]. Unfortunately, accessible design is complicated in practice by a host of factors, such as: the difficulty of gathering requirements and feedback from this segment of the population; the difficulty in simultaneously designing for more than one type of impairment; and, indeed, the difficulties that designers encounter when trying to understand the issues raised as a result of an inclusive design process (c.f. Keates et al. [15]; Choi et al. [5]; Law et al. [17]; Stephanidis and Akoumianakis [34]).The Virtual and Augmented Environments and Realistic User Interactions to Achieve Embedded Accessibility Designs Project22Please refer to http://veritas-project.eu for more information.(VERITAS) provides designers with a framework of design and simulation tools which will help them overcome such challenges. Accordingly, the VERITAS framework provides designers with the capability of choosing from a wide range of disabilities defined within the VERITAS repository and generating a virtual user model (VUM) based on the particular disabilities a potential user might have [20]. Using this VUM, the designer is then shown a simulated experience of how that particular user will perform a given task–of the designer's choice–with the latest iteration of the graphical user interface they are designing.Previous research has shown that the design of the VERITAS framework is adequate in terms of acceptance and usability [33,29]. However, with the completion of the second iteration of the framework, greater insight is being sought through a more detailed analysis driven by evaluators from a broad range of design backgrounds, including: infotainment-games; workplace design; smart living spaces; healthcare; and automotives. Hence, the following research question: what are the key challenges that designers encounter while using the VERITAS framework to improve the accessibility of their ICT products and services?As part of a broader collaborative effort to develop and evaluate the VERITAS framework, this articles presents an analysis conducted by the authors on three specific tools: the Virtual User Model Generator (VerGen), the GUI Simulation Editor (VerSEd-GUI); and the GUI Simulation Viewer (VerSim-GUI). Section 2 provides additional background on the motivation for VERITAS and its related work. Section 3 then describes the framework and each tool in more detail. Section 4 reviews the methodology and Section 5 describes the key findings. The article then closes with a discussion in Section 6, illustrating several implications for the design of tools that aim to address accessibility requirements and several recommendations on how to adapt tools that are intended for use by designers.
