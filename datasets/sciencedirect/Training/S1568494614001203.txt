@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Supplier selection has become a very critical activity to the performance of organizations and supply chains. Studies presented in the literature propose the use of the methods Fuzzy TOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and Fuzzy AHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) to aid the supplier selection decision process. However, there are no comparative studies of these two methods when applied to the problem of supplier selection. Thus, this paper presents a comparative analysis of these two methods in the context of supplier selection decision making. The comparison was made based on the factors: adequacy to changes of alternatives or criteria; agility in the decision process; computational complexity; adequacy to support group decision making; the number of alternative suppliers and criteria; and modeling of uncertainty. As an illustrative example, both methods were applied to the selection of suppliers of a company in the automotive production chain. In addition, computational tests were performed considering several scenarios of supplier selection. The results have shown that both methods are suitable for the problem of supplier selection, particularly to supporting group decision making and modeling of uncertainty. However, the comparative analysis has shown that the Fuzzy TOPSIS method is better suited to the problem of supplier selection in regard to changes of alternatives and criteria, agility and number of criteria and alternative suppliers. Thus, this comparative study contributes to helping researchers and practitioners to choose more effective approaches for supplier selection. Suggestions of further work are also proposed so as to make these methods more adequate to the problem of supplier selection.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Supplier selection (SS) is one of the most important activities of acquisition as its results have a great impact on the quality of goods and performance of organizations and supply chains [1–3]. Through SS it is also possible to anticipate evaluation of the potential of suppliers to establish a collaborative relationship [4].Essentially, supplier selection is a decision process with the aim of reducing the initial set of potential suppliers to the final choices [5,6]. Decisions are based on evaluation of suppliers on multiple quantitative as well as qualitative criteria. Depending on the situation at hand, selecting suppliers may require searching for new suppliers or choosing suppliers from the existing pool of suppliers. In any case there is a degree of uncertainty in the decision process, which is caused by subjective evaluation of qualitative or quantitative criteria, by multiple decision makers, with no previous data to rely on [2,5,7,8].Fuzzy set theory combined with multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods has been extensively used to deal with uncertainty in the supplier selection decision process [9], since it provides a suitable language to handle imprecise criteria, being able to integrate the analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors. This is the case of Fuzzy AHP – Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process [10–16], Fuzzy TOPSIS – Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution [1,17–23], among others.Despite the large number of articles proposing the use of Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS, there are no comparative studies of these two methods when applied to the problem of supplier selection. Ertugrul and Karakasoglu [24] report a comparison of Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS methods applied to facility location decision making. However, as the authors point out, there is still a need for a comparative evaluation of both methods in the context of supplier selection, since the relative advantages of both methods also depend on the characteristics of the problem domain. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the methods Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy AHP applied to the problem of supplier selection. Comparison of the methods was made considering the factors: adequacy to changes of alternatives or criteria; agility in the decision process; computational complexity; adequacy to support group decision making; the amount of alternative suppliers and criteria; and modeling of uncertainty.A descriptive quantitative approach was adopted as the research method [25]. Algorithms of the methods Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy AHP were developed in Matlab© and applied to the selection of suppliers of a company. Comparison of both methods was made based on the analysis of mathematical procedures considering the structure of the problem depicted by the illustrative application case.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly revises the subject of supplier selection and the main requirements of multicriteria decision making methods used in this context. Section 3 presents some fundamental concepts regarding fuzzy set theory and the methods Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy AHP. Section 4 presents the results of using both methods in a real case application. Section 5 presents the comparative analyses of both methods. Finally, conclusions about this research work and suggestions for further research are made in Section 6.Supplier selection is a decision-making process comprising several steps. Based on the studies of Faris et al. [26] and Kraljic [27], De Boer et al. [5] propose a framework for supplier selection that consists of four steps: problem definition, formulation of criteria, qualification and final choice, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The first step aims at clearly defining the problem at hand, which may mean searching for new suppliers for a completely new product, replacing current suppliers, or choosing suppliers for new products from the existing pool of suppliers. Especially in the case of selecting new suppliers, depending on the item to be purchased, the number of alternative suppliers may be very large. This situation demands decision making techniques that are able to simultaneously evaluate several alternatives.In the next step, the buyer should convert its requirements into decision criteria so as to guide the choices. There are several criteria that must be considered in the selection process, both quantitative and qualitative. Table 1lists some important criteria for supplier selection. On top of traditional quantitative measures of performance, such as quality of conformance, delivery time or cost, other measures of subjective evaluation, for example supplier profile and relationship, are gaining importance [28]. Therefore, the techniques used in the decision process must be able to process several criteria of both qualitative and quantitative nature [7].In the qualification step, the main objective is to reduce the initial set of suppliers by sorting potential suppliers from the initial set of suppliers based on qualifying criteria. The last step aims to rank the potential suppliers so as to make the final choice. Based on this framework, Wu and Barnes [6] proposed a further step with the purpose of giving potential suppliers feedback on their performance in the selection process.Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods for supplier selection include multi-attribute techniques, mathematical programming, stochastic programming and artificial intelligence techniques [6,9,41]. There are several different MCDM methods used mostly for outranking.As shown in Table 2, the combination between techniques is usually adopted to deal with the problem of supplier selection. Fuzzy set theory (FST) [42] has been extensively used for modeling decision making processes based on imprecise and vague information such as judgment of decision makers. The use of appropriate techniques can bring effectiveness and efficiency to the selection process [7]. To decide which techniques to use one must take into account the alignment of the particularities of the problem at hand with the characteristics of the techniques [24]. For instance, when selecting a new supplier of a routine item with many potential suppliers [5], techniques that do not limit analysis to only a few alternatives are more adequate than others.Other aspects to be considered to align techniques to particularities of supplier selection are as follows:•Adequacy to support group decision making: purchasing decisions are influenced by several requirements from different functional areas within an organization. This implies that multiple actors from different functional areas are involved in the decision making process [7]. Therefore, it is desirable that the techniques used in supplier selection be adequate to combine different judgments of multiple decision makers.Adequacy to changes of alternatives or criteria: in the case of modified rebuy, one may be interested in purchasing existing products from new suppliers. This may lead to inclusion or exclusion of supply alternatives in the evaluation process. Alternatively, when modified rebuy refers to purchasing new products from current suppliers, this may imply inclusion or exclusion of decision criteria [5,26]. In both cases, the outranking techniques should be robust enough not to cause inconsistencies in the ordering of alternative suppliers.Agility in the decision process: this factor relates mainly to the required amount of judgments of the decision makers in data collection. Depending on the MCDM technique and the number of criteria and alternatives, the quantity of judgments needed to collect all the data can make the supplier selection process very time consuming [61].Computational complexity: this factor may be related to either time or space complexity. The main concern in the supplier selection decision process is related to time complexity, which refers to the time in which the algorithm is accomplished [10]. Time complexity varies from technique to technique as a function of the number of input variables, which in the case of supplier selection refers to the number of alternative suppliers and criteria.Uncertainty: in supplier selection, the uncertainty in decision making may refer to the lack of precision of the scores of the alternatives as well as the relative importance of different criteria. This imprecision may be due to: subjective evaluation by multiple decision makers; inexistence of previous data on the performance of potential suppliers and; difficulty of assessing intangible aspects of supplier performance [7,62].Fuzzy set theory [42] has been used for modeling decision making processes based on imprecise and vague information such as judgment of decision makers. Qualitative aspects are represented by means of linguistic variables, which are expressed qualitatively by linguistic terms and quantitatively by a fuzzy set in the universe of discourse and respective membership function [63]. Operations between linguistic variables involve the concepts presented next.A fuzzy setA¯in X is defined by:(1)A˜={x,μA(x)},x∈Xin whichμA(x):X→[0,1]is the membership function ofA˜andμA(x)is the degree of pertinence of x inA˜IfμA(x)equals zero, x does not belong to the fuzzy setA˜. IfμA(x)equals 1, x completely belongs to the fuzzy setA˜. However, unlike the classical set theory, ifμA(x)has a value between zero and 1, x partially belongs to the fuzzy setA˜. That is, the pertinence of x is true with degree of membership given byμA(x)[42,62].A fuzzy number is a fuzzy set in which the membership function satisfies the conditions of normality(2)supA˜(x)x∈X=1and of convexity(3)C1C2CjCmD˜=A1AiAnx˜11x˜12x˜1jx˜1m⋮⋮⋮⋮x˜n1x˜n2x˜njx˜nmfor all x1, x1∈X and all λ∈[0,1]. The triangular fuzzy number is commonly used in decision making due to its intuitive membership function,W˜=[w˜1+w˜2+⋯+w˜m], given by:(4)μA(x)=0forx<l,x−lm−lforl≤x≤m,u−xu−mform≤x≤u,0forx>u,in which l, m and u are real numbers with l<m<u. Outside the interval [l, u], the pertinence degree is null, and m represents the point in which the pertinence degree is maximum. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are also frequently used in decision making processes [62,64].Given any real number K and two fuzzy triangular numbersA˜=(l1,m1,u1)andB˜=(l2,m2,u2), the main algebraic operations are expressed as follows [62,64]:(1)Addition of two triangular fuzzy numbers(5)A˜(+)B˜=(l1+l2,m1+m2,u1+u2)l1≥0,l2≥0Multiplication of two triangular fuzzy numbers(6)A˜(×)B˜=(l1×l2,m1×m2,u1×u2)l1≥0,l2≥0Subtraction of two triangular fuzzy numbers(7)A˜(−)B˜=(l1−l2,m1−m2,u1−u2)l1≥0,l2≥0Division of two triangular fuzzy numbers(8)A˜(÷)B˜=(l1÷l2,m1÷m2,u1÷u2)l1≥0,l2≥0Inverse of a triangular fuzzy number(9)A˜−1=1u1,1m1,1l1≥0Multiplication of a triangular fuzzy number by a constant(10)k×A˜=(k×l1,k×m1,k×u1)l1≥0,k≥0Division of a triangular fuzzy number by a constantThe Fuzzy TOPSIS method was proposed by Chen [17] to solve multicriteria decision making problems under uncertainty. Linguistic variables are used by the decision makers, Dr(r=1,…,k), to assess the weights of the criteria and the ratings of the alternatives. Thus,W˜rjdescribes the weight of the jth criterion, Cj(j=1,…,m), given by the rth decision maker. Similarly,x˜ijrdescribes the rating of the ith alternative, Ai(i=1,…,n), with respect to criterion j, given by the rth decision maker. Given that, the method comprises the following steps:(i)Aggregate the weights of criteria and ratings of alternatives given by k decision makers, as expressed in Eqs. (12) and (13) respectively:(12)w˜j=1k[w˜j1+w˜j2+⋯+w˜jk](13)x˜ij=1k[x˜ij1+x˜ijr+⋯+x˜jk]Assemble the fuzzy decision matrix of the alternatives(D˜)and the criteria(W˜), according to Eqs.

(21) and (22).(21)A+={v˜1+,v˜j+,…,v˜m+}(22)A−={v˜1−,v˜j−,…,v˜m−}wherev˜j+=(1,1,1)andv˜j−=(0,0,0).Compute the distancesdj+anddi−of each alternative from respectivelyv˜j+andv˜j−according to Eqs. (23) and (24)(23)di+=∑j=1ndv(v˜ij,v˜j+)(24)di−=∑j=1ndv(v˜ij,v˜j−)where d(.,.) represents the distance between two fuzzy numbers according to the vertex method. For triangular fuzzy numbers, this is expressed as in Eq. (25).(25)d(x˜,z˜)=13[(lx−lz)2+(mx−mz)2+(ux−uz)2]Compute the closeness coefficient, CCi, according to Eq. (26).(26)CCi=di−di++di−Define the ranking of the alternatives according to the closeness coefficient, CCi, in decreasing order. The best alternative is closest to the FPIS and farthest to the FNIS.Chang [10] proposed a Fuzzy AHP approach based on the extent analysis method, which is widely used in supplier selection problems [16,24]. This method uses linguistic variables to express the comparative judgments given by decision makers. LetX={x1,xi,…,xn}represent an object set andG={g1,gj,…,gm}a goal set. In the method proposed by Chang [10], each object, xi, is taken and extent analysis is performed for each goal, gj. Thus, m extent analysis values for each object can be obtained, with the following signs:(27)Mgi1,Mgij,…,Mgim,i=1,2,…,nwhere all theMgij(j=1, 2,…,m) are triangular fuzzy numbers.The method follows the steps described next.(i)Compute the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the ith object according to Eq. (28).(28)Si=∑j=1mMgii⊗∑i=1n∑j=1mMgii−1where∑j=1mMgiiis obtained by performing the fuzzy addition operation of m extent analysis values for a particular matrix such that(29)∑j=1mMgii=∑j=1mlj,∑j=1mmj,∑j=1mujand∑i=1n∑j=1mMgii−1is given by(30)∑i=1n∑j=1mMgii−1=1∑i=1n∑j=1mui,1∑i=1n∑j=1mmi,1∑i=1n∑j=1mliCompute the degree of possibility ofS2(l2,m2,u2)≥S1=(l1,m1,u1), where S2 and S1 are given by Eq. (28). The degree of possibility between two fuzzy synthetic extents is defined as in Eq. (31)(31)V(S2≥S1)=supy≥x[min(μS2(y),μS1(x))]which can be equivalently expressed as in Eqs. (32) and (33).(32)V(S2≥S1)=hgt(S1∩S2)=μS2(d)(33)μS2(d)=1,ifm2≥m10,ifl1≥u2l1−u2(m2−u2)−(m1−l1),otherwiseIn Eqs. (32) and (33), d represents the ordinate of the highest intersection point D betweenμS1andμS2, as it can be seen in Fig. 2. The comparison between M1 and M2 requires the values ofV(S2≥S1)andV(S1≥S2).Compute the degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be greater than k convex fuzzy numbers Si(i=1,…,k). This is calculated according to Eq. (34).(34)V(S≥S1,S2,…,Sk)=V[(S≥S1)and(S≥S2)and⋯and(S≥Sk)]=minV(S≥Si),i=1,2,…,k.Compute the vector W′, which is given by Eq. (35).The normalized vector is indicated by(37)W=(d(A1),d(A2),…,d(Ak))Twhere W is a non-fuzzy number calculated for each comparison matrix.A manufacturer of transmission cables for motorcycles needs to select a supplier of metallic components used in a variety of transmission cables. To select the best alternative, five potential suppliers were evaluated against five decision criteria. The evaluation of the potential suppliers in each criterion was made based on linguistic judgments given by the decision makers, a group of employees from the quality and purchase areas of the company. The criteria were defined by the decision makers, as follows:•Quality (C1): related to quality of conformance, quality management and after sale service quality.Price (C2): related to the acquisition cost.Delivery (C3): related to delivery time and reliability.Supplier profile (C4): related to supplier reputation and financial health.Supplier relationship (C5): related to the degree of cooperation and trust in the buyer–supplier relationship.The Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy AHP methods were applied to this case, as described next.Evaluations of the weight of the criteria and the ratings of the alternatives were made by the decision makers according to the linguistic terms depicted in Figs. 3 and 4respectively. Based on Chen [17], triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) were used to specify the linguistic values of these variables, as presented in Tables 3 and 4.Table 5presents the linguistic judgments of the weights of the criteria and the ratings of the alternatives for the three decision makers involved in the selection process. The linguistic variables shown in Table 5 are converted into TFN. Table 6presents the parameters of the TFN resulting from aggregation of the judgments presented in Table 5, which represents the fuzzy decision matrix. The normalized fuzzy decision matrix and the weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix are represented respectively in Tables 7 and 8.According to Chen [17], the Fuzzy Positive Ideal Solution (FPIS, A+) and the Fuzzy Negative Ideal Solution (FNIS, A−) were defined asA+=[(1,1,1),(1,1,1),(1,1,1),(1,1,1),(1,1,1)]A−=[(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0)]The distancesdi+anddi−of the ratings of each alternative from A+ and A–, calculated according to Eqs. (23)–(25), are presented in Tables 9 and 10respectively.The global performance of each supplier alternative is given by the closeness coefficient, CCi, calculated as in Eq. (26) and presented in Table 11. Finally, this calculation led to the outranking presented in Table 11, meaning that supplier A5 is the best alternative, followed by A1, A2, A3 and A4, in this order.The linguistic terms presented in Fig. 5were used by the decision makers to comparatively evaluate the weight of the criteria and the ratings of the alternatives. Following Chang [10], TFN were used to specify the linguistic values of these variables, as presented in Table 12.Table 13presents the comparative judgments of the weights of the criteria made by the three decision makers involved already converted into TFN. The results of aggregation of these fuzzy values are presented in Table 14and were obtained by the arithmetic mean of the judgments.Likewise, the fuzzy values of the aggregated comparative judgments of the alternative suppliers for each criterion made by the three decision makers are presented in Tables 15–19.The consistency ratios (CR) for each comparative matrix were calculated according to Saaty [65] and Facchinetti et al. [66] and are presented in Table 20. As it can be seen, all the values of CR are below 0.20, which confirms the consistency of the comparative judgments.The values of the fuzzy synthetic extent for the criteria matrix are:SC1=(8.71,14.07,20.78)⊗165.94,144.48,127.17=(0.13,0.32,0.76)SC2=(9.84,16.11,22.33)⊗165.94,144.48,127.17=(0.15,0.36,0.82)SC3=(4.13,7.51,11.62)⊗165.94,144.48,127.17=(0.06,0.17,0.42)SC4=(2.32,2.99,5.31)⊗165.94,144.48,127.17=(0.04,0.07,0.20)SC5=(2.16,3.80,5.89)⊗165.94,144.48,127.17=(0.03,0.08,0.22)The degrees of possibility of these fuzzy values, computed as in Eqs. (32) and (33) are:V(SC1≥SC2)=0.93V(SC1≥SC3)=1.00V(SC1≥SC4)=1.00V(SC1≥SC5)=1.00V(SC2≥SC1)=1.00V(SC2≥SC3)=1.00V(SC2≥SC4)=1.00V(SC2≥SC5)=1.00V(SC3≥SC1)=0.67V(SC3≥SC2)=0.59V(SC3≥SC4)=1.00V(SC3≥SC5)=1.00V(SC4≥SC1)=0.20V(SC4≥SC2)=0.14V(SC4≥SC3)=0.57V(SC4≥SC5)=0.90V(SC5≥SC1)=0.27V(SC5≥SC2)=0.20V(SC5≥SC3)=0.65V(SC5≥SC4)=1.00Therefore, the weight vector W′, computed as in Eqs. (35) and (36), is:d′(C1)=V(SC1≥SC2,SC3,SC4,SC5)=min(0.93,1.00,1.00,1.00)=0.93d′(C2)=V(SC2≥SC1,SC3,SC4,SC5)=min(1.00,1.00,1.00,1.00)=1.00d′(C3)=V(SC3≥SC1,SC2,SC4,SC5)=min(0.67,0.59,1.00,1.00)=0.59d′(C4)=V(SC4≥SC1,SC2,SC3,SC5)=min(0.20,0.14,0.57,0.90)=0.14d′(C5)=V(SC5≥SC1,SC2,SC3,SC4)=min(0.27,0.20,0.65,1.00)=0.20W′=(0.93,1.00,0.59,0.14,0.20)After normalization the weight vector is (0.33, 0.35, 0.21, 0.05, 0.07).Calculation of the weight vectors for the alternative evaluation matrices followed the same procedure. The weight vectors from Tables 15–19 are respectively (0.71, 0.97, 1.00, 0.83, 0.69), (0.58, 1.00, 0.80, 0.94, 0.53), (1.00, 0.77, 0.76, 0.78, 0.93), (0.88, 1.00, 0.40, 0.68, 0.82) and (0.80, 0.80, 0.63, 0.69, 1.00).Table 21summarizes the normalized weight vectors of the criteria and alternative suppliers.For supplier alternative A1, the global performance was computed as:D(A1)=(d′(A1C1)×d′(C1)+d′(A1C2)×d′(C2)+d′(A1C3)×d′(C3)+d′(A1C4)×d′(C4)+d′(A1C5)×d′(C5))=0.60The global performance for the other alternative suppliers was computed similarly. Table 22presents the global performance for all the alternatives and their ranking position. Therefore, following this procedure, similarly to the application of Fuzzy TOPSIS, supplier A5 is the best evaluated alternative, followed by A1, A2, A3 and A4, in this order.Comparison of both methods was based on a set of required characteristics of the techniques so as to adequately deal with the problem of supplier selection, as presented in Section 2. The following factors were considered: adequacy to changes of alternatives or criteria; agility in the decision process; computational complexity; adequacy to supporting group decision making; the amount of alternative suppliers and criteria; and modeling of uncertainty.In the supplier selection process, the evaluation of a different set of supply alternatives may require the inclusion or exclusion of alternatives. In this case, the selection method must produce a consistent preference order of alternatives.In the Fuzzy AHP application case, with five alternatives and equal weights for all the criteria, the outranking is A2>A5>A1>A4>A3, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. To test the Fuzzy AHP method, an additional supply alternative (A6) was evaluated. Five tests were performed, each one with an additional alternative with a rating equal to one of the five existing alternatives. For most of the tests, the results have shown no significant changes in the alternative ranking. However, when the additional supply alternative has a rating equal to the best alternative (A2 in Fig. 6a), the resulting preference order changes considerably. In this case, what was the worst alternative, A3, becomes the best one, as shown in Fig. 6b, which is not expected in supplier selection problems. This inversion of alternatives, known as ranking reversal, already pointed out by other studies as a flaw in the AHP method [67–69] also happens in the Fuzzy AHP. On the other hand, in the Fuzzy TOPSIS application case, the same sequence of tests has caused no change at all to the alternative final scores. The order of preferences remained the same in all the tests, with the additional alternative having the same ranking number as the equal rating alternative.In some purchasing situations, we may also need to change some of the criteria used to evaluate the suppliers. In this case, the criteria importance order produced by the selection method must be consistent as well.In the Fuzzy AHP application case, with the five criteria and respective weights, the criteria importance order given by the method was C2>C1>C3>C5>C4. To evaluate the effect of adding a new criterion, five tests were carried out, each one with the additional criterion with a weight equal to one of the five existing criteria. For most of the tests, the results have shown no significant changes in the importance order. Yet, when the additional criterion has a weight equal to the one of C5, then there is an inversion of the importance order. This indicates that the ranking reversal can also happen when there is a change of criteria. In the Fuzzy TOPSIS application case, adding a new criterion has caused no change at all to the criteria importance order.Furthermore, a test was performed to evaluate the effect of excluding a criterion. The starting point was the criteria importance order given by the Fuzzy AHP application case (C2>C1>C3>C5>C4), as illustrated in Fig. 7a. When the criterion C5 was excluded, although the importance order was kept the same, the weight of criterion C4 was reduced to zero. Because of the comparative judgment, the degree of possibilityV(SC4≥SC1)equals to zero. As the calculation of the weight vector uses the MIN operator, the resulting weight of criterion C4 is null. Consequently this criterion does not count at all to the evaluation of the alternatives. The same effect was observed with the exclusion of a second criterion, C4. It was observed that this problem of nulling the weight of a criterion will always happen when the difference between the synthetic extents of two criteria are large enough such that there is no intersection between them and consequently the degree of possibility is zero. Appendix A presents another example in detail in which 5 criteria are considered for weighting and the problem of null weight happens for 2 of them. On the other hand, in the Fuzzy TOPSIS application case, this problem did not happen. This is due to the fact that the criteria matrix(W˜)is computed using arithmetic mean between fuzzy numbers, which will never lead to a null weight.This factor evaluates the amount of judgments required from specialists in both methods. Considering n the number of suppliers and m the number of criteria, in the Fuzzy TOPSIS method, m judgments for each of the n alternatives are required, in addition to the m judgments related to the weight of the criteria. This can be expressed as in Eq. (38).(38)Jn,mTOPSIS=m+nm=m(n+1)In the case of the Fuzzy AHP method, the number of required judgments for a decision matrix Aixiis:(39)JAi,i=ii−12Since there are m matrices of size n×n (one for each decision criterion) in addition to the decision matrix of size m×m related to the weight of the criteria, the total number of required judgment is(40)Jn,mAHP=mm−12+mnn−12Based on Eqs. (38) and (40), Fig. 8presents the number of judgments for both methods when the number of alternatives and criteria vary from 2 to 9. It can be seen that as the number of criteria and alternatives increase, the number of required judgment using Fuzzy AHP is in general greater than that using Fuzzy TOPSIS. In the application case, the Fuzzy TOPSIS required 30 judgments while the Fuzzy AHP required 60 judgments. If there are 9 alternatives and 9 criteria, the Fuzzy AHP requires four times more judgments than the Fuzzy TOPSIS. On the other hand, when there are few criteria and alternative (J2×2, J2×3, J2×4, J3×2), the required judgments using Fuzzy TOPSIS is greater than when using Fuzzy AHP. An exception is made to J3×3 and J2×5, when both methods require the same number of judgments. Therefore, it can be said that the Fuzzy TOPSIS method performs better than the Fuzzy AHP in regard to the level of interaction with decision makers to data collection. In this sense, Fuzzy TOPSIS provides greater agility in the decision process than Fuzzy AHP.The computational complexity of both methods was evaluated considering only the time complexity. Similarly to Chang [10], the time complexity, T, was appraised based on the number of times of multiplications within the algorithms. In this study, exponentiation and logical operations were additionally used as a measure of time complexity.Considering there are n alternative suppliers and m criteria, the Fuzzy TOPSIS method requires 3nm operations to compute the normalized decision matrix, 3nm operations to compute the weighted decision matrix and 14nm operations to compute the distancesdi+anddi−. Therefore, the time complexity, Tn,m, of the Fuzzy TOPSIS method is given by Eq. (41).(41)Tn,m=3nm+3nm+7nm+7nm=20nmFollowing the same approach, the Fuzzy AHP method requires 6m(n+1) operations to compute the fuzzy synthetic extent to all the decision matrices,nm(n−1)+n(n−1)to compute the degrees of possibility, n(m+1) to normalize the vector W′ and finally nm operations to compute the global performance. Thus, the time complexity, T’n,m, of the Fuzzy AHP method is given by Eq. (42).(42)T′n,m=6m(n+1)+nm(n−1)+n(n−1)+n(m+1)+nm=n2(m+1)+m(7n+6)The graphics in Fig. 9a show the time complexity variation as a function of number of alternatives for different numbers of criteria for both methods. It can be seen that in general Fuzzy AHP performs better than Fuzzy TOPSIS. In the application case, the Fuzzy TOPSIS method required 500 operations while the Fuzzy AHP method required 355 operations. However, when the consistency tests of the judgment matrices are performed, the time complexity of the Fuzzy AHP method, T’n,m, increases by a factor of 4n(m+1). In this case, the Fuzzy TOPSIS method performs slightly better than the Fuzzy AHP as it increases the number of alternatives, although in most cases Fuzzy AHP still performs better, as shown in Fig. 9b. In the application case, even with the consistency test, the Fuzzy AHP method required 475 operations, slightly less than the Fuzzy TOPSIS.Both methods allow aggregation of judgments of more than one decision maker. In the case of the Fuzzy TOPSIS method, aggregation of different judgments is made according to Eqs. (12) and (13) for the weights of the criteria and the ratings of the alternative suppliers. In the case of the Fuzzy AHP, although this is not explicitly considered in the method proposed by Chang [10], he suggests that aggregation be made using the arithmetic mean of the judgments.Since the amount of data required by the Fuzzy AHP method is greater than that required by the Fuzzy TOPSIS, increasing the number of decision makers will consequently cause a larger increase in the time complexity of the Fuzzy AHP when compared with the TOPSIS method. Therefore, although both methods support group decision making, due to the impact on time complexity, the Fuzzy TOPSIS method is preferable.Even though both methods compute aggregation based on fuzzy arithmetic mean, an alternative approach would be to weight the judgments of the different decision makers and aggregate the data by computing a weighted mean. For instance, the procurement staff is better able to judge the performance of suppliers and therefore their judgments should be more relevant than the judgments of others not so involved with procurement.The Fuzzy TOPSIS method does not impose any restriction on the number of alternatives or criteria used in the selection process. On the other hand, the comparative analysis of the Fuzzy AHP method imposes some limitation on the number of criteria and alternatives. Saaty [65] suggests that the number criteria or alternatives to be compared using AHP be limited to nine so as not to compromise human judgment and its consistency. This suggestion applies equally to the Fuzzy AHP method. In the application case, with five criteria and five alternatives, the use of the Fuzzy AHP method was perfectly viable. Although the limitation of the number of criteria can be alleviated by deploying the criteria into the Fuzzy AHP hierarchy structure, the number of alternatives imposes a real limitation. Therefore, the choice of the method depends on the particularities of the circumstances at hand. For instance, when selecting a new supplier for a new product, with many potential suppliers, the Fuzzy TOPSIS is a better choice.Both methods utilize fuzzy set theory to deal with the inherent lack of precision of the data used in the supplier selection decision process. In both methods the fuzzy number morphology is the main resource for quantifying imprecision. Due to the vagueness of judgments of qualitative variables, the parameters of the triangular membership functions can be chosen so as to better represent the linguistic terms used by each decision maker to evaluate the alternatives regarding different decision criteria.In the case of Fuzzy AHP method, the use of pairwise comparisons by means of comparative linguistic variables is itself a way to deal with imprecision. This feature makes this method more appropriate than the Fuzzy TOPSIS when the purpose is to replace a supplier. As an example, Table 23presents the judgments of two suppliers when compared in respect to four criteria of equal weights aiming at evaluating the benefit of replacing A1 for A2. In this case, the supplier global performance given as a relative measure facilitates the interpretation of the decision makers (equivalent to 0.32 for A1 and 0.68 for A2). Other advantages of the Fuzzy AHP compared to Fuzzy TOPSIS in this example are fewer judgments and less computational complexity.
