@&#ABSTRACT@&#
By means of bond theory, we study Stewart Gough (SG) platforms with n-dimensional self-motions withn>2. It turns out that only architecturally singular manipulators can possess these self-motions. Based on this result, we present a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions. Therefore this paper also solves the famous Borel Bricard problem for n-dimensional motions. We also give some remarks and a new result on SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions; nevertheless a full discussion of this case remains open.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The geometry of a Stewart Gough (SG) platform is given by the six base anchor pointsMiwith coordinatesMi:=(Ai,Bi,Ci)Twith respect to the fixed system and by the six platform anchor pointsmiwith coordinatesmi:=(ai,bi,ci)Twith respect to the moving system (fori=1,…,6). Each pair(Mi,mi)of corresponding anchor points is connected by an SPS-leg, where only the prismatic joint (P) is active and the spherical joints (S) are passive.If the geometry of the manipulator is given, as well as the lengths of the six pairwise distinct legs, the SG platform is generically rigid. But, under particular conditions, the manipulator can perform an n-dimensional motion (n>0), which is called self-motion. Ifn>1holds, the self-motion is a so-called multidimensional one.Note that self-motions are also solutions to the still unsolved problem posed by the French Academy of Science for the Prix Vaillant of the year 1904, which is also known as Borel Bricard problem (cf. Borel, 1908; Bricard, 1906; Husty, 2000) and reads as follows: “Determine and study all displacements of a rigid body in which distinct points of the body move on spherical paths”.It is already known that manipulators, which are singular in every possible configuration, possess self-motions in each pose (overC). These so-called architecturally singular SG platforms are well studied and classified (for the planar case we refer to Karger, 2003; Nawratil, 2008; Röschel and Mick, 1998; Wohlhart, 2010 and for the non-planar case see Karger, 2008; Nawratil, 2009). In contrast only a few self-motions of non-architecturally singular SG platforms are known. A detailed review of these self-motions was given in Nawratil (2012a), which is as complete as possible to the best knowledge of the author. Moreover until now only the following non-architecturally singular SG platform with a multidimensional self-motion is known to the author: The platform and the base are congruent. This so-called congruent SG platform has a 2-dimensional self-motion, if all legs have equal length. It can easily be seen that this self-motion is pure translational.Example 1We consider a special congruent SG platform, which is also known as Wren platform (cf. Wohlhart, 1996). As in this case, the anchor points are located on two circles (see Fig. 1a), the Wren platform is an architecturally singular manipulator (cf. Bricard, 1906; Chasles, 1861; Karger, 2002). If all legs have equal length, there also exists a 1-dimensional Schönlfies self-motion (see Fig. 1b), beside the already mentioned 2-dimensional translational self-motion (see Fig. 1c). In Fig. 1a, the branching singularity (cf. Gogu, 2009) of these two self-motions is displayed. Due to Wohlhart (1996), the manipulator is called kinematotropic, as it can change the dimension of mobility.Beside the determination of additional examples of non-architecturally singular SG platforms with multidimensional self-motions, we also want to close the knowledge gap, whether non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions exist (cf. footnote 3 of Husty and Karger, 2002). This still open problem is answered within the article at hand, which is structured as follows:In Section 2.1, we give a short introduction to the theory of bonds for SG platforms with self-motions. Depending on the dimension β of the bonding surface of the 3-dimensional self-motion after its projection from the Study parameter space into the Euler parameter space, we can distinguish four cases:β=−1,0,1,2(cf. Section 2.2). In Section 3, we prove that non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=2do not exist. In Section 4, we show that this is also the case forβ=−1,0,1. Based on the obtained results, we give a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions withn>2, in Section 5. Finally, we close the paper with some remarks and a new result on SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions (cf. Section 6).In Section 2.1, we give a short introduction to the theory of bonds for SG manipulators presented in Nawratil (2014), which was motivated by the bond theory of overconstrained closed linkages with revolute joints given by Hegedüs, Schicho and Schröcker (2012) (see also Hegedüs et al., 2013). We start with the direct kinematic problem of parallel manipulators of SG type and proceed with the definition of bonds. Based on these basics, we do some preparatory work in Section 2.2 by giving a classification of 3-dimensional self-motions, which is induced by the bond theory in a natural way.Due to the result of Husty (1996), it is advantageous to work with Study parameters(e0:e1:e2:e3:f0:f1:f2:f3)for solving the forward kinematics. Note that the first four homogeneous coordinates(e0:e1:e2:e3)are the so-called Euler parameters. Now, all real points of the Study parameter spaceP7(7-dimensional projective space), which are located on the so-called Study quadricΨ:∑i=03eifi=0, correspond to a Euclidean displacement, with exception of the 3-dimensional subspace E of Ψ given bye0=e1=e2=e3=0, as its points cannot fulfill the conditionN≠0withN=e02+e12+e22+e32. The translation vectort:=(t1,t2,t3)Tand the rotation matrixR:=(rij)of the corresponding Euclidean displacementx↦Rx+tare given by:t1=2(e0f1−e1f0+e2f3−e3f2),t2=2(e0f2−e2f0+e3f1−e1f3),t3=2(e0f3−e3f0+e1f2−e2f1),and(1)R=(e02+e12−e22−e322(e1e2−e0e3)2(e1e3+e0e2)2(e1e2+e0e3)e02−e12+e22−e322(e2e3−e0e1)2(e1e3−e0e2)2(e2e3+e0e1)e02−e12−e22+e32),if the normalizing conditionN=1is fulfilled. All points of the complex extension ofP7, which cannot fulfill this normalizing condition, are located on the so-called exceptional coneN=0with vertex E.By using the Study parametrization of Euclidean displacements, the condition that the pointmiis located on a sphere centered inMiwith radiusRi, is a quadratic homogeneous equation according to Husty (1996). This so-called sphere conditionΛihas the following form:(2)Λi:(ai2+bi2+ci2+Ai2+Bi2+Ci2−Ri2)N−2(aiAi+biBi+ciCi)e02−2(aiAi−biBi−ciCi)e12+2(aiAi−biBi+ciCi)e22+2(aiAi+biBi−ciCi)e32+4(ciBi−biCi)e0e1−4(ciAi−aiCi)e0e2+4(biAi−aiBi)e0e3−4(biAi+aiBi)e1e2−4(ciAi+aiCi)e1e3−4(ciBi+biCi)e2e3+4(ai−Ai)(e0f1−e1f0)+4(bi−Bi)(e0f2−e2f0)+4(ci−Ci)(e0f3−e3f0)+4(ai+Ai)(e3f2−e2f3)+4(bi+Bi)(e1f3−e3f1)+4(ci+Ci)(e2f1−e1f2)+4(f02+f12+f22+f32)=0.Now the solution of the direct kinematics overCcan be written as the algebraic variety V of the idealIspanned byΨ,Λ1,…,Λ6,N=1. In general V consists of a discrete set of points with a maximum of 40 elements.We consider the algebraic motion of the mechanism, which is defined as the set of points on the Study quadric determined by the constraints; i.e. the common points of the seven quadricsΨ,Λ1,…,Λ6. If the manipulator has an n-dimensional self-motion then the algebraic motion also has to be of this dimension. Now the points of the algebraic motion withN≠0equal the kinematic image of the algebraic variety V. But we can also consider the points of the algebraic motion, which belong to the exceptional coneN=0. An exact mathematical definition of these so-called bonds can be given as follows (cf. Remark 5 in Nawratil, 2014):Definition 1For an SG manipulator the setBof bonds is defined as:B:=ZarClo(V⋆)∩{(e0:…:f3)∈P7|Ψ,Λ1,…,Λ6,N=0},whereV⋆denotes the variety V after the removal of all components, which correspond to pure translational motions. MoreoverZarClo(V⋆)is the Zariski closure ofV⋆, i.e. the zero locus of all algebraic equations that also vanish onV⋆.The restriction to non-translational motions is caused by the following approach used for the computation of bonds: In a first step we project the algebraic motion of the mechanism into the Euler parameter spaceP3by the elimination off0,…,f3. In a second step we determine those points of the projected point set, which are located on the quadricN=0. For more details please see Nawratil (2014).Clearly, the kernel of this projection equals the group of translational motions. As a consequence a component of V, which corresponds to a pure translational motion, is projected to a single pointO(withN≠0) of the Euler parameter spaceP3by the elimination off0,…,f3. Therefore the intersection ofOandN=0equals ∅, which reasons the exclusion of pure translational motions within this approach.Moreover it is important to note that the set of bonds depends on the geometry of the manipulator, and not on the leg lengths (cf. Theorem 1 of Nawratil, 2014).Due to Theorem 2 of Nawratil (2014) an SG platform possesses a pure translational self-motion, if and only if the platform can be rotated about the centerm1=M1into a pose, where the vectorsMimi→fori=2,…,6fulfill the conditionrk(M2m2→,…,M6m6→)≤1. Moreover all 1-dimensional self-motions are circular translations, which can easily be seen by considering a normal projection of the SG manipulator in direction of the parallel vectorsMimi→fori=2,…,6. If all these five vectors are zero-vectors, which corresponds with the case that the platform and the base are congruent, then we get the already mentioned 2-dimensional translational self-motion.Remark 1As these translatoric self-motions have spherical trajectories there exists no 3-dimensional translatoric self-motion of an SG platform.We assume that a given SG manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motionS. AsScorresponds with a 3-dimensional solution of the direct kinematics problem, the corresponding algebraic motion is also 3-dimensional. Due to the fact that this algebraic motion is the kinematic image of a self-motion, it cannot be located within the exceptional coneN=0(hypersurface). Therefore the bond-set of this self-motion has to be an algebraic variety of dimension 2; i.e. a bonding surface.Now we want to classifySwith respect to the dimension β of the bonding surface after its projection into the Euler parameter spaceP3. As we have a bonding surface in the Study parameter spaceP7, β can take the values−1,0,1,2, where the caseβ=2is the general one. In order thatβ=iholds fori=−1,0,1, there has to exist a(2−i)-dimensional translational sub-self-motion, which is contained inS, in each pose ofSaccording to Definition 1. Fori=−1this already implies thatSis a 3-dimensional translation.To make things clearer, we give the following example:Example 2We study a congruent SG platform where the anchor points are located on two parallel lines. As this is also a conic section, the manipulator is again architecturally singular. If all legs have equal lengths, this manipulator has two 2-dimensional self-motions, where the first one (parallelogram mode) is the already known translation (cf. Fig. 2a). Therefore this self-motion is of typeβ=−1.The second 2-dimensional self-motion (anti-parallelogram mode) has a 1-dimensional translational sub-self-motion (circular translation) in each pose of its self-motion (cf. Fig. 2b).For this manipulator, we can compute the bond-set according to Nawratil (2014). The two parallel lines of the base are given by the x-axis of the fixed frame and an x-parallel line through the point(0,d,0)Tof the fixed frame withd>0. Therefore the base anchor points have coordinates(gi,0,0)Tand(hi,d,0)T, respectively, withgi,hi∈R. The corresponding platform anchor points have the same coordinates with respect to the moving frame. Then we can compute the set of bondsBaccording to Nawratil (2014), which yields the following four bonds, up to conjugation of coordinates:B:={(−2u/d:2uI/d:0:0:v:−vI:u:−uI),(2u/d:2uI/d:0:0:v:vI:u:−uI),(0:0:−2u/d:2uI/d:u:uI:vI:v),(0:0:2u/d:2uI/d:u:uI:−vI:v)},where I denotes the complex unit. Note that only the first and second bond can belong to the anti-parallelogram self-motion, as the x-axes of the moving and the fixed frame are parallel and equally directed during this self-motion (⇔e2=e3=0). By restricting us to the first four coordinates, we project the first and second bonding curve11Note that the ratiou:vcan be seen as projective parameter with(u,v)≠(0,0).to the Euler parameter spaceP3, which yields the points(−1:I:0:0)and(1:I:0:0). This shows that the anti-parallelogram self-motion is indeed of typeβ=0.Moreover it should be noted that this manipulator does not change the dimension of mobility but the type of mobility (cf. Fanghella et al., 2006) according to the above given classification of self-motions.22Note that the Wren platform also changes the type of mobility with respect to this classification in its branching singularity, as the Schönlfies self-motion is of typeβ=0(cf. Example 1 of Nawratil, 2014).The flattened position of the manipulator illustrated in Fig. 2c is a bifurcation configuration between the parallelogram mode (β=−1) and the anti-parallelogram mode (β=0).A necessary condition for a non-architecturally singular SG platform with a 3-dimensional self-motion is that the 4-legged manipulator resulting from the removal of two legs, which fulfill certain conditions in order to enable the 3-dimensional self-motion, has also a 3-dimensional self-motion.33If there is only one leg, which fulfills a certain constraint, then its removal would imply that any arbitrary 5-legged manipulator has two degrees of freedom, which yields a contradiction to the formula of Grübler.Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) we can assume that the removed legs are those with index 5 and 6, respectively. Then the solution of the direct kinematics overCof this 4-legged manipulator can be written as the algebraic varietyV4of the idealI4spanned byΨ,Λ1,…,Λ4,N=1.Now the bond-setB4of the 4-legged manipulator can be defined analogously to Definition 1 byB4:=ZarClo(V4⋆)∩{(e0:…:f3)∈P7|Ψ,Λ1,…,Λ4,N=0},whereV4⋆denotes the varietyV4after the removal of all components, which correspond to pure translational motions.AsI4is a subideal ofI, the bond-setBis a subset ofB4. Based on the four leg constraintsΛ1,…,Λ4, the bonding surfaceB4can be computed as follows:We compute the equationΔj,i, which denotes the differenceΛj−Λiof two sphere constraints. Note thatΔj,iis only linear inf0,…,f3. Now we can solve the equationsΨ,Δj,i,Δk,i,Δl,iwith pairwise distincti,j,k,l,m∈{1,…,4}forf0,…,f3and plug the obtained solutions into the remaining equationΛi. The numerator of the resulting expression is a polynomial G of degree 8 in the Euler parameters, which can also be seen as an octic surface Γ in the Euler parameter spaceP3.Note thatG=0is the algebraic variety of the elimination-ideal ofΨ,Λ1,Λ2,Λ3,Λ4with respect tof0,…,f3. As the elimination off0,…,f3is done linearly, G does not depend on the choice ofi∈{1,…,4}. Therefore each point of Γ corresponds to an orientation of the 4-legged manipulator, which can be extended to a solution of the forward kinematics problem (overC). Summed up we can say that the points of Γ withN≠0are the projection ofV4into the Euler parameter spaceP3, which is induced by the elimination off0,…,f3.Moreover it should be noted that the linear systemΨ,Δj,i,Δk,i,Δl,icannot be solved for thefi's if and only if the 4-legged manipulator has one of the following geometries (cf. pages 512–513 of Husty et al., 1997, as well as pages 23–24 of Nawratil, 2004):1.m1,…,m4are collinear andM1,…,M4are collinear,the platform and the base are planar and the anchor points are related within an affinity,the platform and the base are congruent and non-planar.The intersection of Γ andN=0already yields the projection of the bond surfaceB4intoP3. AsN=0is an irreducible quadratic surface inP3, the intersection of Γ andN=0can only be of dimensionβ=2if:(A)G is fulfilled identically. Then the intersection equalsN=0.Γ containsN=0; i.e. G is reducible where N factors out. Then the intersection equals againN=0.If G is fulfilled identically, the 4-legged manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motion independently of the chosen leg lengthsR1,…,R4. Therefore the 4-legged manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motion in each pose. By attaching again two arbitrary legs it follows that the resulting SG platform has a 1-dimensional self-motion in each pose and therefore it is singular in each pose (⇒ architecturally singular SG platform). Hence the 4-legged manipulator has to be a degenerated manipulator (cf. Karger, 1998), which can only be one of the following cases44After a possible necessary renumbering of anchor points and exchange of the platform and the base.according to Karger (cf. Karger, 2008, 1998):(a)m1=m2=m3andM1,M2,M3are collinear,m1=m2=m3=m4,m1,…,m4are collinear,M1,…,M4are collinear and the conditionCV(m1,m2,m3,m4)=CV(M1,M2,M3,M4)holds, where CV denotes the cross-ratio of points.As the degenerated 4-legged manipulators are excluded we can assume w.l.o.g. that there exist two pairs of anchor points(Mi,mi)and(Mj,mj)withMi≠Mjandmi≠mjfori≠j. Moreover we can assume w.l.o.g. thati=1andj=2hold. In addition, we can choose special coordinate systems in the platform and the base in a way thata1=b1=c1=b2=c2=c3=0andA1=B1=C1=B2=C2=C3=0hold. Due toA2a2≠0, we can eliminate the factor of similarity by settingA2=1.In order that Γ containsN=0, the resultantP[1955651]of G and N with respect toe3has to vanish identically, where the number in the brackets gives the number of terms. Fortunately, P is the perfect square of an expressionQ[7589], where Q is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8 ine0,e1ande2. We denote the coefficient ofe0ie1je2kof Q byQijk. Based on this preparatory work we can prove the following lemma.Lemma 1A non-degenerated general 4-legged manipulator can only have a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=2, if three anchor points in the platform or base are collinear.ProofThe proof is done by contradiction; i.e. we assume that no three anchor points are collinear and show that no solution exists. To do so, we considerQ116=−4a2b3B3F1[6]andQ206−Q026=4a2b3B3F2[10]. Asa2=0yields a contradiction andb3B3=0the collinearity of three anchor points, we remain withF1=0andF2=0. We compute the resultantF12ofF1andF2with respect tob3which yields:c4(b42+c42)(B42+C42)[(B3−B4)2+C42].The second and the third factors can only vanish forb4=c4=0andB4=C4=0, respectively, which already implies three collinear anchor points. In order to improve the readability of the article and to streamline the presentation, a detailed discussion of the remaining two cases is given in Appendix A.Lemma 2A non-degenerated general 4-legged manipulator has a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=2if and only if one of the following conditions are fulfilled (under consideration of footnote 4):I.m1=m2=m3,m1=m2andM3=M4.ProofThe proof of the sufficiency can easily be done by direct computations as follows. For both designs I and II we compute Γ, where N can be factored out. The remaining polynomial is denoted by ϒ. Therefore the conditions are sufficient for the factorization. Moreover we have to show that the designs are also sufficient for the existence of a 3-dimensional self-motion. This is the case, if there exist leg lengthsR1,…,R4in a way that ϒ is fulfilled identically. It can easily be verified that the resulting system of equations has the following solution for:(3)design I:R1=M1M4¯,R2=M2M4¯,R3=M3M4¯,R4=m1m4¯,(4)design II:R1=M1M4¯,R2=M2M4¯,R3=m1m3¯,R4=m1m4¯.This proves the sufficiency. Moreover the conditions of Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) show thatm1coincides withM4during the self-motion. As a consequence, the 3-dimensional self-motion equals the complete spherical motion group.Therefore we only remain with the proof of the necessity of the conditions given for design I and II, which is done as follows: Due to Lemma 1 we can assume w.l.o.g. thatm1,m2,m3are collinear. Moreover we can assume that there exist two pairs of anchor points(Mi,mi)and(Mj,mj)withMi≠Mjandmi≠mjfor distincti,j∈{1,2,3}, as the non-existence already implies the conditions of design I (under consideration of footnote 4). W.l.o.g. we can seti=1andj=2. In addition we can choose special coordinate systems in the platform and the base in a way thata1=b1=c1=b2=c2=b3=c3=c4=0andA1=B1=C1=B2=C2=C3=0hold. Due toA2a2≠0, we can eliminate the factor of similarity by settingA2=1.Now the expressionQ[7589]simplifies to(e02+e12)Q⋆[1498], whereQ⋆is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 6 ine0,e1ande2. We denote the coefficient ofe0ie1je2kofQ⋆byQijk⋆. Based on this preparatory work, the proof of the necessity is split with respect to the criterion whether four anchor points are aligned or not. In order to improve the readability of the article and to streamline the presentation, a detailed discussion of both cases is given in Appendix A.Remark 2It should be noted that every SG manipulator, which possesses one of the 4-legged manipulators of Lemma 2 as subassembly, already has at least a 1-dimensional spherical self-motion.In the following three lemmata the remaining special cases are treated. For their proofs we refer to the corresponding technical report (Nawratil, 2013a) of this article, as they can be done in a fashion similar to the general case.Lemma 3A non-degenerated 4-legged manipulator, which belongs to the special case 1, cannot have a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=2.Lemma 4A non-degenerated 4-legged manipulator, which belongs to the special case 2, cannot have a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=2.Lemma 5A 4-legged manipulator, which belongs to the special case 3, cannot have a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=2.The results of Section 3 are summed up within the next theorem:Theorem 1Non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=2do not exist.ProofThe proof of this theorem is based on the results obtained in Lemmas 1–5. Now we have to add two further legs (legs 5 and 6) to the only non-degenerated 4-legged manipulators with a 3-dimensional self-motion (design I and II of Lemma 2) without restricting the dimension of this self-motion. A necessary condition for this is that every 4-legged manipulator of the resulting SG platform equals design I or II, respectively.As a consequence, we can only attach the fifth and sixth leg to design I under the side conditionM4=M5=M6. But this yields an architecturally singular SG manipulator (cf. item 2 of Theorem 3 of Karger, 2008).Analogous considerations for design II show that we can only attach the fifth and sixth leg ifm1=miandM4=Mjhold with distincti,j∈{5,6}. This yields again the architecturally singular manipulator given in item 2 of Theorem 3 of Karger (2008).  □We start this section by studying 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=−1:Theorem 2SG platforms (architecturally singular or not) with 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=−1do not exist.ProofAccording to Remark 1 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=−1cannot exist. But this can also easily be seen as follows: We assume that an SG manipulator configuration exists, where the manipulator can perform a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=−1. Therefore the manipulator can be moved out of this configuration by any translation of arbitrary direction. By choosing e.g. the direction of the P-joint of the i-th leg, we see that the corresponding sphere conditionΛiis violated, which already yields the contradiction.  □We proceed with the 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=1:Theorem 3Non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=1do not exist.ProofFor a 3-dimensional self-motionSof typeβ=1, there has to exist a 1-dimensional translational sub-self-motion in each pose ofS. According to the last paragraph of Section 2.1, a necessary condition for the existence of an SG manipulator withSof typeβ=1is that there exists a 2-parametric set of platform orientations withm1=M1andrk(M2m2→,…,M6m6→)≤1.A necessity for this circumstance is that form1=M1the vectorsM2m2→andM3m3→are linearly dependent. In the following we use this necessary condition for the proof of Theorem 3:As the legs are not allowed to coincide, we can assume w.l.o.g. thatM1≠M2holds. We can choose special coordinate systems in the platform and the base in a way thata1=b1=c1=b2=c2=c3=0andA1=B1=C1=B2=C2=C3=0hold. Due toA2≠0we can eliminate the factor of similarity by settingA2=1.Now we compute the images ofm2andm3under the spherical motion with centerm1=M1by the multiplication of the rotation matrix R of Eq. (1) withm2andm3, respectively. Therefore the above mentioned condition of linear dependency can be written as:(5)(Rm2−NM2)×(Rm3−NM3)=o,where o is the zero-vector. This implies three conditions denoted bySi, wherei=1,2,3denotes the corresponding line of Eq. (5) after division by N (which factors out). Now these three conditions have to have a common factor. A necessary condition for this is that the resultantTijofSiandSjwith respect toe0is fulfilled identically for distincti,j∈{1,2,3}.T12factors into4a2b3e3T[10]withT[10]:=(1−a2)(B3+b3)e12+(1+a2)(B3−b3)e22+2(a2A3−a3)e1e2.In order to improve the readability of the article and to streamline the presentation, a detailed discussion of the resulting cases is given in Appendix A.Therefore we remain with the 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=0, which are studied next:Theorem 4Non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions of typeβ=0do not exist.ProofAnalogous considerations as in the proof of Theorem 3 show that a necessary condition for the existence of an SG manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=0is that there exists a 1-parametric set of platform orientations withmi=Mifori=1,2,3. Clearly, this can only be the case if all three anchor points are located on a line. Therefore this condition implies a congruent SG platform, where all anchor points are collinear. This is a trivial architecturally singular manipulator (cf. item 1 of Theorem 3 of Karger, 2008), which finishes the proof of Theorem 4.  □The answer to the question asked in footnote 3 of Husty and Karger (2002), whether non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 3-dimensional self-motions exist, is included within the next theorem.Theorem 5Non-architecturally singular SG platforms, which possess an n-dimensional self-motion withn=3,4, do not exist. SG platforms (architecturally singular or not) with higher-dimensional self-motions than 4 do not exist.ProofDue to Theorems 1–4, this is true forn=3. Therefore we focus on the casen=4, for which Theorem 5 is proven by contradiction. If we replace a leg of the non-architecturally singular SG platform, which fulfills a condition in order to enable the 4-dimensional self-motion, by an arbitrary leg (not causing an architecturally singular design), we end up with a non-architecturally singular manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion; a contradiction.Therefore we only remain with the proof of the last sentence of Theorem 5. If we couple the platform and the base only by one leg with non-zero length, the motion is a 5-dimensional one.55A leg with zero length already restricts the mobility to three dimensions.A second leg with non-zero length, which differs from the first one, already restricts the motion to a 4-dimensional one, which finishes the proof.  □Due to this theorem, only architecturally singular manipulators can have n-dimensional self-motions withn=3,4. As preparatory work for a complete list of these manipulators, which is given in Theorems 6 and 7, we will prove the following lemma:Lemma 6A 4-legged manipulator can only have a 4-dimensional self-motion, if it is the following degenerated one (under consideration of footnote 4): All base anchor points are collinear and the four platform anchor points collapse into one point.ProofWe assume that there exists a 4-legged manipulator with a 4-dimensional self-motion. If we replace one of the four legs, which fulfills a certain constraint in order to enable the 4-dimensional self-motion, by an arbitrary leg, we end up with a 4-legged manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion, where one leg is free of any constraints. Therefore it can only be either design I of Lemma 2 or item (a) of Section 3.1.1. As the latter is a special case of design I we can restrict ourselves to this case.Now the question arises, how design I can be specified to obtain even a 4-dimensional self-motion. In order to find an answer, we first consider the 3-legged manipulator withm1=m2=m3. Trivially the 3-dimensional spherical self-motion with centerm1can only be extended by one further dimension (circular translation), ifM1,M2,M3are collinear. This 4-dimensional self-motion is not restricted by the attachment of a fourth leg, if and only if the fourth leg belongs to the pencil of lines spanned by the first three legs. This results in the conditions given in Lemma 6.  □Based on this lemma we can prove the following theorem:Theorem 6If an SG platform has a 4-dimensional self-motion, it has to be the following architecturally singular design (under consideration of footnote 4): All base anchor points are collinear and the six platform anchor points collapse into one point (cf.Fig. 3a).ProofAs each 4-legged manipulator of the SG platform has to have a 4-dimensional self-motion, the result is implied by Lemma 6.  □If an SG platform has a 3-dimensional self-motion, it has to be one of the following architecturally singular designs (under consideration of footnote 4):1.m1=m2=m3andM4=M5=M6(cf.Fig. 3b).m1=m2=m3=m4andM5=M6(cf.Fig. 3c).m1=m2=m3=m4=m5(cf.Fig. 3d).All base anchor points are collinear and all platform anchor points are collinear. Moreover corresponding anchor points are related by a regular projectivity κ:Mi↦mifori=1,…,6(cf.Fig. 3e).ProofThe designs 1, 2 and 3 possess at least a 3-dimensional spherical self-motion ifm1coincides withM6. Design 4 is highly redundant as the six legs belong to a regulus of lines and therefore one can remove any three legs without changing the direct kinematics and singularity surface (cf. page 222 of Koenigs, 1897). As a consequence the manipulator has trivially a 3-dimensional self-motion.Therefore these conditions are sufficient for the existence of 3-dimensional self-motions. In the following we show that they are necessary as well. To do so we distinguish the following cases with respect to the rank of the manipulator's Jacobian66According to Merlet (1989) the i-th row of this6×6matrix J can be interpreted as the normalized Plücker coordinates(li,lˆi)of the carrier line of the i-th leg, whereliis the normalized direction vector of the leg andlˆi:=Mi×liits moment vector.J in a generic configuration.Due to Theorem 5 we only have to consider the cases1<rk(J)<6, where the caserk(J)=2yields a 4-dimensional self-motion, which was already discussed in Theorem 6. Therefore we proceed with the caserk(J)=3, which trivially implies a 3-dimensional self-motion:•rk(J)=3: It follows directly from the items (a)–(c) of Section 3.1.1 that these SG platforms have either the design of item 4 or one of the following four designs (under consideration of footnote 4):(i)m1=m2=m3=m4=m5andM1,…,M5collinear (cf. Fig. 4a).m1=m2=m3=m4=m5=m6(cf. Fig. 4b).m1,…,m6are collinear,M1,…,M6are collinear,m1=m2=m3andM4=M5=M6(cf. Fig. 4c).m1,…,m6are collinear,M1,…,M6are collinear,m1=m2=m3=m4andM5=M6(cf. Fig. 4d).If we have an architecturally singular manipulator withrk(J)>3, it has to contain a non-degenerated 4-legged manipulator with a 3-dimensional self-motion. Due to our results obtained in the proofs given in Sections 3 and 4, there only exist the two designs I and II of Lemma 2 with this property.Therefore we have to add two further legs (legs 5 and 6) to these two designs without restricting the 3-dimensional self-motion. A necessary condition for this is that every 4-legged manipulator of the resulting SG platform is either a degenerated one (items (a)–(c) of Section 3.1.1) or equals design I and II, respectively.•rk(J)=4: If we check the possible combinatorial cases with respect to the conditionrk(J)=4, it is not difficult to figure out that we get the following cases (under consideration of footnote 4) beside the design given in item 3:(i)m1=m2=m3,M4=M5=M6,m4,m5,m6collinear andM1,M2,M3collinear (cf. Fig. 5a).m1=m2=m3,M4=M5=M6,m1,…,m6collinear andM2,…,M6collinear (cf. Fig. 5b).m1=m2=m3=m4,M5=M6andM1,…,M4collinear (cf. Fig. 5c).m1=m2=m3=m4,M5=M6,m1,…,m6collinear andM2,…,M6collinear (cf. Fig. 5d).rk(J)=5: If we check the possible combinatorial cases with respect to the conditionrk(J)=5, it is not difficult to figure out that we get the two cases given in items 1 and 2 of Theorem 7.Remark 3In the author's opinion, the following interesting property of the design, given in item 4 of Theorem 7, should be noted: In the general case the 3-dimensional self-motion is of typeβ=2. If κ is a similarity (cf. proof of Theorem 3), we get a typeβ=1self-motion. Moreover if κ is the congruence and all legs have equal length, we even get a 3-dimensional self-motion of typeβ=0(cf. proof of Theorem 4). Finally it should be mentioned that the manipulator design with the 4-dimensional self-motion, which is always of typeβ=2, can also be obtained from item 4 of Theorem 7 by assuming that κ is singular.Within this article we gave a complete list of all SG platforms, which have n-dimensional self-motions withn>2(cf. Theorems 6 and 7). All these manipulators are architecturally singular (cf. Theorem 5).Therefore only the study of SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions remains open within the field of multidimensional self-motions. Based on Theorem 3 of Karger (2008), it is not difficult to give a list of all architecturally singular manipulators withrk(J)=4. This is left to the reader. The more challenging problem, which is still unsolved, is the determination of all architecturally singular designs withrk(J)=5possessing 2-dimensional self-motions. This list is of interest as from each entry non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 1-dimensional self-motions can be constructed in the same way as done for SG manipulators with so-called type II DM self-motions (cf. Nawratil, 2013b). This topic is dedicated to future research.Finally, we want to give a new result on non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions. Beside the pure translational self-motion (⇒ typeβ=−1) of the congruent SG platform, there exists a further trivial example, which was not mentioned before in the literature, to the best knowledge of the author. This design, implied by the results obtained in Section 3, can be given as follows (under consideration of footnote 4): Form1=m2=m3andM4=M5there exists a 2-dimensional self-motion ifm1coincides withM4. This self-motion is a pure spherical one (⇒ typeβ=1) with centerm1=M4.It remains open, whether further non-architecturally singular SG platforms with 2-dimensional self-motions exist (especially a design with a typeβ=0self-motion) beside the two already known ones. This topic is dedicated to future research as well.
