@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play an important role in the economic development, making it necessary to assess the quality of service perceived by consumers in this sector. The most effective quality assessment from the consumer perspective is still to be researched, yet the most common approach is oriented towards quantitative indicators. This study proposes to use a two-dimensional model that combines the widely accepted segmentation of ICTs with elements from the SERVQUAL quality model. This model, useful in multi-criteria decision-making situations, has been developed using the 2-tuple linguistic representation and fuzzy logic principles. This methodology prevents data loss during processing and provides relevant information through 16 indicators related to the quality of service. Besides, an expert-based mechanism is defined for the use of historical information extracted from completed surveys. As a practical case, this mechanism is applied to the historical information of a telecommunications company for assessing the quality of the service provided to its customers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
ICTs have become a crucial part of economy [1–3]. This is something that many developing countries have assumed, as for instance Ecuador, where important investments have been made in the recent years for the development of ICTs, according to the Andean Development Corporation (CAF11http://publicaciones.caf.com/media/39689/cartilla_ecuador.pdf.), the Ecuadorian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society (MINTEL22http://www.industrias.ec/archivos/CIG/file/CARTELERA/MINTEL-TIC%20para%20el%20Desarrollo.pdf.) and the Coordination Ministry of Ecuador's Strategic Sectors (MICOSE33http://issuu.com/sectoresestrategicos/docs/informe_de_rendicio__n_de_cuenta_20.). These investments are mainly directed to areas related to infrastructure, human capital, digital public services, digital economy and innovation.Due to this, it is necessary to assess both the current situation of ICT development and their evolution in time, in order to check the effectiveness of the measures and plans adopted so far. In this sense, both state entities and companies in the sector have a large amount of information at their disposal, from which significant knowledge can be obtained [4,5]. The surveys conducted regularly are one of the tools available for collecting information over time, in order to know the perceived quality of ICTs among the population. This type of studies meets specific needs of the moment and the people conducting it, their composition being the result of specific and heterogeneous requirements (widely varying from one case to another). These features make their integration complicated due to the varied nature of the information collected and its evolution in time.The mostly used research methodology for assessing quality of service from the perspective of users’ perception is called SERVQUAL, which consists of five basic indicators: tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. On the basis of this methodology, several quality assessment mechanisms have been developed and obtained good acceptance levels in different sectors: education [6], banking [7,8], telecommunications [9], health care [10,11], public services [12,13], professional services [14], retail [15], transport and delivery [16], finance [17], tourism and hotels [18], digital libraries [19], web services [20] and military and medical air transport [21].There has been a shy attempt in the ICT sector to define an assessment standard for the quality of service based on SERVQUAL. Some of these studies in ICT sectors refer to: information technology [22,23], mobile services [24], retail banking [25] and telephone users [26], among others. However, there was limited and partial assessment in all of them, and therefore it was not possible to use them for assessing perceived quality of ICTs in a given country.Given this framework, the first purpose of this paper is to define an assessment standard for the quality of service in the ICT sector, mainly based on the principles of the SERVQUAL methodology, which we called SICTQUAL. Although SERVQUAL indicators can be used to assess the quality of ICT services, the term ICT is too broad (hardware, protocols, contents, software, training, business, etc.), making it necessary to use an additional subscale which allows segmentation of the different areas integrating ICTs and which is widely accepted. Besides, an additional indicator would be added to the original SERVQUAL indicators, called Overall Satisfaction Index (OSI), as several authors have already done [27–29]. SICTQUAL will therefore be a two-dimensional model integrated mainly by the SERVQUAL assessment indicators (including the new OSI indicator) and a widely accepted segmentation of ICTs.The second purpose of this paper is related with the use of information from previously completed surveys that include aspects concerning one or more SERVQUAL indicators, as well as the use of different ICT segments: the definition of a model which converts the different existing surveys about the quality of ICT services to the new SICTQUAL model proposed. The starting point for achieving this purpose is the assessment made by different ICT experts, in order to associate each survey item from the original surveys with each of the SICTQUAL indicators (ICT segments and SERVQUAL assessment elements). Possibly, one item from the original surveys (expressed in natural language) is related to more than one SICTQUAL element and has different relationships with each of them. Given this uncertain overview, it is considered that expressing this relationship linguistically would largely facilitate experts’ work, thanks to the closeness of linguistic information to the human cognitive model. In these cases, the fuzzy linguistic approach allows successful modelling of the linguistic knowledge [30]. In this context, the processing of the linguistic labels was successfully performed through both computing with words and 2-tuple representation models [31,32], which allow working with these expressions under certain premises and prevent information loss.Therefore, the model to achieve our second purpose could be defined as a Linguistic Multi-Criteria Decision-making (LMCDM) model. Decision-making is a common process in many activities. In this particular case, decisions are made on the basis of uncertain knowledge or personal perceptions. The LMCDM model would collect expert opinions (inputs) using the linguistic format and it would also linguistically express – through 2-tuple representation – how each item from the original surveys is related to each of the SICTQUAL indicators (outputs). This conversion would be subject to the compliance of a consensus previously established by the experts.As a result of this first LMCDM model, we obtain a value represented in linguistic 2-tuple for each item (question) of the input surveys, relating the item with the SICTQUAL scale. The use of this information opens a second LMCDM process which calculates, based on the respondents’ answers to each item of the original survey, a final questionnaire expressed in SICTQUAL.The proposed model was applied in Ecuador to surveys about the quality of ICT services, answered by users of the public company Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (National Telecommunications Corporation), which has the greatest market share in landline telephony and broadband Internet access. The possibility to integrate the information from different opinion surveys conducted by this company is very helpful for checking the validity of the information to be analysed and it allows having additional information that has not been taken into account. This also means time and money saving, since other studies conducted in the past might contain relevant and useful information for new analyses or studies the company needs.The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the preliminary concepts used for explaining the elements involved in the model, such as linguistic variables and 2-tuple representation, the LMCDM model and the SERVQUAL model. Section 3 describes the functioning of the SICTQUAL model, while Section 4 explains the underlying calculation model and its application to cases involving historical information (extracted from completed surveys). Section 5 displays a case study where the presented model is applied. Finally, Section 6 puts forward the conclusions and future work.This section introduces the concepts and foundations on which the proposed model is based. Hence, Section 2.1 deals with linguistic variables and their representation. Section 2.2 presents an approach of the fuzzy linguistic model based on 2-tuple representation. Section 2.3 deals with linguistic multi-criteria decision-making, while Section 2.4 introduces the consensus measuring. Finally, Section 2.5 presents the quality of service assessment model SERVQUAL.Linguistic variables [30] are variables with values expressed in natural language – words or sentences – instead of numbers. The values of the linguistic variables are called linguistic labels.Definition 1A linguistic variable is determined by a quintuple (H, T(H), U, G, M), where:H is the name of the variable.T(H) symbolises the set of linguistic labels related to H.U is the universe of discourse of the variable.G is the syntactic rule to generate T(H) values. The linguistic terms are often directly provided, distributed on a scale with a relation of total order.M is the semantic rule that relates each linguistic label X of T(H) to its meaning M(X), where M(X) is a diffuse subset of U.The focus in this paper is set on the use of linguistic information for modelling users’ perceptions about the ICT services provided, according to their answers to a set of questions or statements. The most frequently used scale is Likert's [33], consisting of a set of linguistic qualifiers with an equal number of positive and negative values and a central neutral value related to the statement asked. This scale will also be used in the system proposed in this article, for the assessments of the ICT experts involved in the process.According to different authors [34–37], linguistic variables are an appropriate mechanism for modelling this type of Likert scales, since they have the ability to express the uncertainty typical of the linguistic terms integrating the scale. Therefore, using linguistic variables we can achieve a much more accurate modelling of the information concerned than we would with conventional numerical variables.The next step would be to define the linguistic variables that model the perceptions expressed through the Likert scale. The granularity of the set of labels and the labels themselves will be determined by the specific qualifiers used in the definition of the Likert scale. Besides, the appropriate semantic will have to be provided to each linguistic label. Certain authors [38–40] have addressed the issue considering that this semantics can be described with triangular linear functions, as they model quite well the implicit uncertainty of each term of the scale.Below, the definition of a variable that models a 5-Likert scale, respecting its implicit philosophy, meaning that all the labels are equally informative, there is a central label associated to the neutral term, and the rest of labels are symmetrically distributed around it.Example of definition of a linguistic variable called 5-Likert Scale:•H=5-Likert Scale.T(H)=S, where S={s0,…,sT}, T=4.U=[0,1].G=S, according to the order relation si<si⇔i<j, where i, j∈ {0,…,T}.M: the semantic meaning of every label will be determined by a triangular linear function assigning a 3-tuple (a, b, c) to each label, where b is the central point with a membership value of 1, while a and c are the left and right ends of the triangular function which defines the domain of the label concerned. For instance: s0=(0, 0, 0.250); s1=(0, 0.250, 0.500); s2=(0.250, 0.500, 0.750); s3=(0.500, 0.750, 1.000); s4=(0.750, 1.000, 1.000), as shown in Fig. 1.This general definition could be used for any question in a questionnaire based on the 5-Likert scale, by simply defining a new H variable with the same characteristics mentioned above and with the appropriate labels or terms included in S. For instance, for a question in a survey about the quality of service a given organisation provided to a user, the definition of the corresponding linguistic variable could be the following: H=Level of agreement with the service provided, and one possible set of labels would be: s0=Strongly Disagree (SD), s1=Disagree (D), s2=Neutral (N), s3=Agree (A), and s4=Strongly Agree (SA).The fuzzy linguistic approach developed by Zadeh [41,42] is a tool designed to model problems with qualitative information. It is based on the concept of linguistic variable and has been successfully used in many domains, including decision-making problems, recommendation systems and quality of service, among others. Examples of application of this model in different domains can be found in [18,39,43–50], among others.The approach of the fuzzy linguistic modelling used in the proposed model will be addressed in this section, that is, the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach described by Herrera and Martínez [51], with a quite broad application. The 2-tuple model requires the linguistic variables used in it to be integrated by equally informative labels, with triangular representation, and symmetrically distributed around the central label. As explained in the previous section, the scales used in this paper can be represented with linguistic variables defined according to these requirements, which allows the 2-tuple processing. The great advantage of using this 2-tuple model lies in the fact that it performs the processes of computing with words without information loss, unlike other fuzzy linguistic approaches such as the classical one [52], or the ordinal one [53]. This model is more formally outlined hereafter:Let S={s0, …, sT} be a set of linguistic terms established with odd cardinality, where the mid value represents an indifference value and the rest of terms are symmetric in respect of this mid value, where the semantic of the labels is assumed to be obtained through triangular membership functions. Besides, all the terms are considered to be distributed on a scale with the defined order si<sj⇔i<j. In this context, if b∈[0, T], where b∉{0, …, T} is the result of the aggregation of a set of linguistic labels, the ordinal or symbolic fuzzy linguistic approach [53] applies a rounding function to obtain a label si(from the existing labels in the S set) as a result of the aggregation. The application of the rounding entails a loss of information. The 2-tuple approach considers a representation with a couple of values (si, α), that is, the label siand a second parameter α∈[−0.5, 0.5), which prevents information loss and is called symbolic translation. It needs to be mentioned that (si, α) is equivalent to siwhen the symbolic translation is 0, so α=0.Definition 2According to Herrera and Martínez [51]:Let S={s1, …, sT} be a set of linguistic terms and b∈[0, T] the resulting value of the symbolic aggregation operation, then the 2-tuple representation expressing the information equivalent to b is obtained with the following function:(1)Δ:[0,T]→S×[−0.5,0.5)(2)Δ(b)=(si,α),withi=round(b)α=b−iwhere round (·) is the rounding operator, siis the closest index label to b, and α is the value of the symbolic translation.It needs to be noted that Δ is bijective. Thus, Δ−1:S×[−0.5, 0.5)→[0, T] is defined by:(3)Δ−1(si,α)=i+α=bExample: Let S={s0, s1, s2, s3, s4} be a set of linguistic terms and b=1.9 the result of the symbolic aggregation operation. The 2-tuple expressing the information equivalent to b is Δ(b)=Δ(1.9)=(s2, −0.1), since round(b)=2 and b−i=−0.1.The computational model is defined through the introduction of the following operators:1.Comparison of 2-tuples: based on a lexicographic order. Let (sk, α1) and (sl, α2) be 2-tuples:•If k<l, then (sk, α1)<(sl, α2).If k=l, then:1.If α1=α2, then (sk, α1)=(sl, α2) and represent the same informationIf α1<α2, then (sk, α1)<(sl, α2)If α1>α2, then (sk, α1)>(sl, α2)Negation:(4)Neg((si,α))=Δ(T−(Δ−1(si,α)))where T+1 is the cardinality of S, since S={s0, …, sT}.Aggregation: Using the functions Δ and Δ−1, which transform numerical values into linguistic 2-tuples and vice versa without information loss, it is possible to use any existing aggregation operator. Herrera and Martínez [31] establish in their study several definitions of aggregation operators.Decision-making is a complex process and one of the basic activities of human beings. We are constantly confronted with situations where we have to choose one or more option(s) – the best one(s) – from among different alternatives, by assessing a series of criteria. In a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making (LMCDM) model [54], the objective is to find the best alternative(s) from among a set ofalternatives=alternative1,…,alternativem, based on the linguistic assessments provided by an expert group. In these cases, the experts formulate criteria that are gathered in the set ofcriteria=criterion1,…,criterionn. It is also frequently assumed that the importance of the assessments is determined by differentweights=weight1,…,weightn, also linguistically expressed. Assessments are stored in the setassessments=assessmentij,∀i∈1,…,m,∀j∈1,…,n.As mentioned previously, the perceptions used in our model belong to respondents to the survey and ICT experts, expressed on a Likert scale using the linguistic representation mentioned in Definition 1. Besides, and in view of achieving higher accuracy of the model to be built, all this information is considered to be represented with the 2-tuple model. It must be noted that a label with the si∈S value can be represented in the 2-tuple model through the expression (si, 0), that is to say, with a symbolic translation equal to zero.Therefore, the LMCDM model used in this study could be formalised through the LMCDM_2t function:(5)LMCDM_2t:criterion1…criterionnweight1…weightnalternative1⋮alternativemassessment11…assessmentn1⋮⋱⋮assessment1m…assessmentnm→alternative1⋮alternativemcollective_preference1,consensus_value1⋮⋮collective_preferencem,consensus_valuemThe different phases of this decision-making process are the classical ones for this type of problem (aggregation and exploitation), with the following characteristics of the model to be implemented:Aggregation phase: The experts’ preferences, that is to say, the elements of the assessment set, are combined based on the weights expressed in the weights set through the appropriate aggregation operator, thus obtaining the setcollective_preferences=collective_preference1,…,collective_preferencemwith the collective preference value for every alternative included in the alternatives set. It is necessary in this type of problems that the aggregation is performed with a sufficient level of consensus among the experts (criteria accepted by them), by expressing these values in the setconsensus_values=consensus_value1,...,consensus_valuem. Both the collective preference values and the consensus values are expressed through the 2-tuple model, which allows a more accurate calculation, without information loss. The values of thecollective_preferencesset are calculated through a linguistic weighted average defined for the 2-tuple model [31]:(6)collective_preferencei=1−∑j=1nΔ−1(assessmentij)×Δ−1(weightj)∑j=1nΔ−1(weightj)∀i∈1,…,mSection 2.4 presents the values of consensus on the basis of which the elements of theconsensus_valuesset will be calculated.Exploitation phase: If the problem requires selecting only the best options, the ones in the alternatives set with the highest collective preference values will be selected. In other words, the ones with the highest values from thecollective_preferencesset. In other cases a high level of consensus among the experts is required, equal to or above the minimum consensus threshold, γ∈S.According to [55–57], the degree of consensus is the correspondence between the relations of preference expressed by different actors. In other words, a measure for calculating the degree of group agreement based on the experts’ individual preferences. The measurement of the degree of consensus is normally based on similarity or distance metrics that calculate the proximity between the experts’ preferences. Aggregation operators are also used for obtaining the degree of global agreement in a group, by aggregating the similarity values previously calculated.The measurement of consensus referred to here is based on [58–60] approaches, defined as follows:(7)consensus_valuei=1-∑j=1nΔ-1collective_preferencei-Δ-1assessmentij×Δ-1weightj∑j=1nΔ-1weightj∀i∈1,…,mThe SERVQUAL model is a model based on surveys, having the purpose of measuring the quality of any kind of organisation providing services. It was originally proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry [61], which is why it is also known as the PZB (initials of the authors’ family names) model. The research conducted by these authors was based on several independent surveys conducted with executives of service companies and client-oriented groups. Initially, they proposed a scale integrated by ten indicators or measurement elements. The number of indicators used in the initial scale varied in time [62], thanks to new statistical correlation methods developed between 1991 and 1994 [63,64], being finally reduced to five elements: tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. Some authors [65,66] proposed an additional generic indicator that allows to measure user's global satisfaction, called Overall Satisfaction Index (OSI), also used in the present paper. The PZB model consists of a scale of several answers designed to understand customer expectations from a service. This model, as its creators admit, can be adapted to the context and nature of the service to be analysed. Several authors have done so, adapting the SERVQUAL tool for analysing user expectations and perceptions related to different services, based on the quality of the service provided [67–73]. Although there are other methods for analysing quality of service, such as SERVPERF [74], QDF [75] and E-S-QUAL [76], among others, SERVQUAL is still the most widely used method in the quality-of-service research, for being a very reliable measurement method [77].The adapted SERVQUAL model used in this paper consists of the following indicators:•Tangibility: Appearance of physical facilities, equipment, staff and communication material.Reliability: Ability to provide services in a careful and reliable manner.Responsiveness: Readiness and willingness to help users and provide prompt services.Assurance: Proven knowledge and attention of staff and skills to instil credibility and trust.Empathy: Customised attention provided by the organisation to its clients.Overall Satisfaction Index: Degree of general satisfaction with the services provided.However, in spite of this adaptation, the use of only these SERVQUAL elements for measuring the quality of ICT services seems limited. This is mainly due to the fact that ICTs usually cover several sectors of the economy, which are often interrelated. Therefore, in order to perform an effective measurement of the service quality in the ICT sector, a model encompassing all the particularities of the sector is needed. The next section presents the newly designed and implemented model.As already mentioned, the SERVQUAL model is considered to provide appropriate and useful elements for creating a model that allows measuring the quality of service in the ICT sector. However, the concept of ICTs is too generic and wide, so the semantics of every SERVQUAL indicator will depend on the specific ICT sector to which it is applied. Therefore, after having delimited the concept of ICT, a widely accepted segmentation of the ICTs is proposed in this section. Thereafter, the new SICTQUAL model will be defined for the assessment of ICTs from the consumer perspective.According to Sánchez-Pinilla [78], ICTs consist of: computers, multimedia equipment, local area networks, Internet, digital television, etc. A more accurate definition can be found in Romaní’s work [79], which provides 86 concepts in total, classified and grouped according to opinions expressed by survey respondents. It is worth taking also into consideration the European Commission's definition in its communication to the Council and the European Parliament, in the document The role of ICTs in EC development policy (COM/2001/077044http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52001DC0770.):“Information and communications technologies (ICTs) is a term which is currently used to denote a wide range of services, applications, and technologies, using various types of equipment and software, often running over telecom networks.”The answer to the question “What are ICTs and in what segments are they divided?” is obtained in this context. The resulting segmentation is a necessary and key element for creating the SICTQUAL model, as it will become clear in the next sections. Therefore, it can be concluded that ICTs are divided in three large segments or pillars, namely Services, Applications and Technologies, defined in the next section.The following definitions stand for Services, Applications and Technologies mainly provided, developed, implemented or appropriate for being used by consumers in a specific environment (for instance, in a specific country or region):•Services: ICTs accessed by users remotely and electronically (e-management, e-learning, e-commerce, etc.) in order to communicate with their service providers for: tax declaration, payment of duties, registration of personal information, social security procedures, health procedures, communication with education centres, financial transactions, online training, online stock purchase/sale, contracting, etc.Applications: the software installed on the different types of devices (terminals or hardware), such as: smartphones, tablets, computers, TV, cameras, etc., which provides some facility to the device users. In the case of ICTs, it is the analysis of the software used in business, government or personal applications, developed, implemented, customised and/or adapted for being used in a specific country, by people from that country. In other words, it is the software created to be used specifically by the inhabitants of a specific country and developed by people from that country.Technologies: It refers to hardware, equipment and means of access to information provided by the service provider to consumers, including elements such as: bandwidth, communication equipment, perceived speed, wireless signal intensity (Wi-Fi/3G/4G/WiMax/…), quality of the Internet connection, level of coverage of the telecommunications network, etc.In order to represent the SICTQUAL model, a two-dimension matrix (see Table 1) will be used, including:•The basic SERVQUAL scale (described in Section 2.5): S1=Tangibility, S2=Reliability, S3=Responsiveness, S4=Assurance and S5=Empathy, distributed on the matrix columns.The ICT widely accepted segments (defined in Section 3.2): C1=Services,C2=Applications and C3=Technologies, distributed on the matrix rows.Besides, the model will have a global quality indicator applicable to all ICT segments:•The SERVQUAL Overall Satisfaction Index (see Section 2.5): OSI. It is worth mentioning that, as defined by other authors, this indicator is generic and global, which is why we consider it is not appropriate to define it for every ICT segment, but for all in general.More formally, the model would be defined through the SICTQUAL_items set composed by 16 items: SICTQUAL_items={SICTQUALk}, ∀k∈{1, …, 16}, where the meaning of each element is the one expressed in Table 1. In order to improve understanding of this set, it is also expressed as the union between the two dimensions set specified (SERVQUAL scales and ICT segments) and the Overall Satisfaction Index common to all ICT segments, that is to say,SICTQUAL_items=CiSj∪OSI,∀i∈1,…,3,∀j∈1,…,5.Now that the SICTQUAL model allows us to assess each ICT segment according to the basic measurement indicators of the quality of service (extracted from SERVQUAL) and the overall satisfaction index (cross-segment indicator applicable to all ICT segments), we introduce a model that allows us to convert to SICTQUAL other similar satisfaction studies based on previously completed surveys, although they have a different format. This allows us to compare and integrate these studies, in spite of them being based on heterogeneous surveys.Fig. 2shows a general overview of this model, where the input information represents the answers provided by the users in the questionnaires (surveys). Their processing consists of a group of experts analysing the correspondence between each question and the set of elements integrating the SICTQUAL matrix (ICT segments/SERVQUAL indicators) and assigning linguistic labels. These expert assessments, together with the set of answers provided by the users, are subject to three LMCDM processes, to finally get the users’ point of view about the 16 quality indicators of the model, as well as the degree of consensus between all the users for each indicator.This model takes the original questionnaire as an input, integrated by a series of questions expressed in natural language. The survey can be defined through the setquestions=question1,…,questionp. A group of users,users=user1,…,userm, has answered every question of the survey and the answers have been grouped under the setanswers=answer11,…,answermp. These answers are expressed through a Likert scale with the appropriate labels included in the sets Sk, that is to say,answerjk∈Sk,∀j∈1,…,m,∀k∈1,…,p. As mentioned before, each of these questions will be modelled with its corresponding linguistic variables as explained in Definition 1, considering that H=questionkandTH=Sk,∀k∈1,…,p.The aim of the proposed model is to obtain:1.The perception of every consumer userjabout ICTs, expressed with the SICTQUAL model:sictqual_answers=sictqual_answer1j,…,sictqual_answer16j,∀j∈1,…,m.The overall perception of ICTs, taking into account the opinion of all the respondents to the original questionnaire, expressed with the SICTQUAL model:sictqual_overall=sictqual_overall1,…,sictqual_overall16.The items of these two sets are based on a Likert scale with an equal number of elements, modelled with the corresponding linguistic variables (see Definition 1). Therefore: H=assessment of the quality of service of thesictquall,∀l∈1,…,16item, where the labels forming the corresponding set T(H) could be, for instance: s0=“Very Low” (VL), s1=“Low” (L), s2=“Regular” (R), s3=“High” (H), and s4=“Very High” (VH). For higher accuracy, all the results are expressed with the 2-tuple model.In order to achieve these results, a three phase system is proposed (see Fig. 3) with interdependent phases, as the output of each of them becomes the input of the next one.The three phases are explained in detail hereafter:Phase I. The main goal at this stage is to obtain the degree of relation of every question in the original form,questionk,∀k∈1,…,p, with every SICTQUAL item; in other words, with each sictquall, ∀l∈{1, …, 16}. The degree of relation is represented assictqual_weightsk=sictqual_weight1k,…,sictqual_weight16kand will be calculated as the collective and agreed upon preference of an expert group.Therefore, this phase can be stated as p LMCDM processes, one for each questionk, ∀k∈{1, …, p}, with the following configuration and inputs for the LMCDM_2t function (explained in Section 2.3):•An ICT expert group will be available, experts={expert1, …, expertn}, who will establish the different criteria involved in this process. Therefore,criterioni=experti,∀i∈1,…,n.Every expertiwill formulate a self-evaluationweighticoncerning their level of expertise in the ICT sector, their self-evaluation being the weights in the LMCDM processes:weights={weight1,...,weightn}.The alternatives will be represented by each item of the SICTQUAL model:alternativel=sictquall,∀l∈{1,…,16}.Besides, each expertiwill assess how every questionkis related to each SICTQUAL item, the assessments being expressed through the setassessmentsk={assessmentilk},∀i∈{1,…,n},∀l∈{1,…,16}. It is also possible to find no relation whatsoever between a question and the corresponding SICTQUAL item. In this case, it will be noted as “–”.As previously mentioned, all the information provided by the experts (self-assessment of expertise and relation between the questions and the SICTQUAL items) will be expressed with a Likert scale modelled with the corresponding linguistic variables (see Definition 1).Applying the LMCDM_2t function, the following required outcome is obtained:•The collective preference value of the process,collective_preferencesk=collective_preference1k,…,collective_preference16k, representing the degree of relation between each questionkand each SICTQUAL item, which means the alternatives of the process. The alternative having a level of consensus under the minimum threshold γ=s3=H will not be taken into account. In other words, the collective preference values will only be taken into account if the level of consensus among the experts is at least “High” (considering this as the threshold label established within the set of labels used, which in the case mentioned above is made up of the labels: VL, L, R, H, VH). Therefore, the final results of this phase are obtained as follows:sictqual_weight1k=collective_preferencelk,ifconsensus_valuelk≥γ∀l∈{1,…,16}"_"otherwisePhase II. In this phase, thesictqual_answersset is obtained, i.e. every user's perception about ICTs, expressed with the SICTQUAL model. Thesictqual_answerlj,∀l∈{1,…,16},∀j∈{1,…,m},elements are obtained with 16 LMCDM processes, one for each SICTQUAL item. Each of these processes identified with the l iterator will obtain the userjassessment for the sictquallitem, that is to say,sictqual_answerlj, according to their answers to the original questionnaire (included in the answers set) and to the results obtained in Phase I. The configuration and inputs for the LMCDM_2t function (defined in Section 2.3) of each process are described hereafter:•The criteria will consist of all the p questions in the original questionnaire, so criterionk=questionk, ∀k∈{1, …, p}.The weight of each criterion will be the level of relation between each specific question k and the SICTQUAL item l concerned. In other words:weightk=sictqual_weightlk, ∀k∈{1, …, p}, ∀l∈{1, …, 16} obtained in Phase I.The alternatives consist of each survey respondent:alternativej=userj,∀j∈{1,…,m}.User assessments of the questions in the original survey will integrate the assessmentsset, soassessmentjk=answerjk,∀j∈{1,…,m},∀k∈{1,…,p}.After applying the LMCDM_2t function, the following result is obtained in this case:•The setcollective_preferencesj=collective_preference1j,...,collective_preference16j, representing the answers of every user m converted to sictquallitems:sictqual_answerjl=collective_preferencelj,∀j∈{1,…,m},∀l∈{1,…,16}.Phase III. In this last phase, the overall perception of ICTs by the whole set of users is obtained according to the SICTQUAL model and its 16 items:sictqual_overall={sictqual_overall1,…,sictqual_overall16}.This is solved through an LMCDM process with the following configuration and inputs for the LMCDM_2t function (see Section 2.3):•The criteria will be determined this time by every survey respondent: criterionj=userj, ∀j∈{1, …, m}.Since there is no additional information about a user being more important than another, each of the criteria considered (users, in this case) will have equal weights:weightj=sr∈S,∀j∈{1,…,m}. It is also possible to ask a self-assessment of the user experience in the ICT sector; in that case, the self-assessment can be used as the weight of the user concerned.The alternatives will consist of each SICTQUAL item:alternativel=sictquall,∀l∈{1,…,16}.The users’ answers converted to SICTQUAL (obtained in Phase II) will integrate the assessments set, soassessmentjl=sictqual_answerjl,∀j∈{1,…,m},∀l∈{1,…,16}.After having applied the LMCDM_2t function, the following results would be obtained:•The setcollective_preferences={collective_preference1,...,collective_preference16}representing the overall assessment of all the users in the SICTQUAL format:sictqual_overalll=collective_preferencel,∀l∈{1,…,16}.The setconsensus_value={consensus_value1,…,consensus_value16}representing the degree of consensus of all the users concerning acollective_preferencel,∀l∈{1,…,16},element.A case of study is illustrated below, where the presented model is applied to historical information extracted from previously conducted surveys with ICT users in Ecuador.As stated in the introduction, the government of Ecuador has been carrying out important investments in ICT development for the past years. Thus, observing the evolution of the perceived quality of service in the ICT sector through a standard specifically developed for ICTs is crucial nowadays, since it could provide very relevant information for their improvement. The SICTQUAL model presented in Section 3 aims to address this need. Additionally, as a transversal model that integrates both the different ICT fields or segments considered as standard and the different aspects that make up service quality (SERVQUAL scales), SICTQUAL could be applied as a tool to assess and follow up investment policies in ICTs within the strategy plans of a country. These strategy plans usually include a number of indicators called Key Performance Indicator (KPI) [80], intended for showing the progress in a specific aspect of the plan. Thus, the 16 items of the SICTQUAL model could be included like the corresponding KPIs in order to observe the evolution of the aspect modelled for each item.Section 4 shows how studies on the quality of ICT services with formats other than the SICTQUAL model can be transformed into such model. This would allow the SICTQUAL model to be operational even before it is implemented as a standard. We have been working on the transformation of the studies conducted with users of the state-owned telecommunications enterprise in Ecuador CNT EP55https://www.cnt.gob.ec/., market leader in Ecuador due to its number of fixed telephony users66http://www.arcotel.gob.ec/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=11178&force=1.(>85%) and fixed broadband Internet users77http://www.arcotel.gob.ec/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=11171&force=1.(>55%), in January 2015, according to Ecuador's Agency for the Regulation and Control of Telecommunications.In this section and as a case study selected for the application of the proposed model, we will explain the conversion to SICTQUAL of a survey conducted in the second half of 2012 concerning the Commercial Internet service. The form of the survey may be viewed in Annex I(a).First, the questionnaire to be converted is defined as questions={Q1, …, Qp}, wherep=28. This questionnaire has been completed by a target audience of 544 users, i.e. users={user1, …, userm}, with m=544. All the answers follow a 5-Likert scale, although the labels were not always the same in all the questions and thus we define the appropriate linguistic variables for each question by specifying the sets Sk, ∀k∈{1, …, p}. For instance, S2=S3=S4=S5=S11=S12=S13=S14=S15, where s0=“StronglyDisagree”, s1=“Disagree”, s2=“Neutral”, s3=“Agree”, and s4=“StronglyAgree”. The other sets of labels that were used to answer the questions of the survey may be found in Annex I(b).As seen in the previous section, the conversion model consists of three interdependent phases which are formed mainly by LMCDM processes implemented based on the LMCDM_2t function (explained in Section 2.3). For this specific problem we would need p+16+1 LMCDM processes (28 for Phase I, 16 for Phase II and 1 for Phase III, 45 processes in total). Due to the resulting complexity, we have proceeded to implement the model suggested in Section 4 through IBM's SPSS Modeller88http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/es/spss-modeler.software by following the scheme proposed by Carrasco et al. [49]. A capture of the implementation of our model in this tool is shown in Fig. 4. Note that vertical lines separate the inputs (the elements on the far left), the output (the element on the far right) and the three processing phases seen in our model, following exactly the same distribution shown in Fig. 3.Hereafter we explain the phases followed for solving the specific problem addressed in this section:Phase I. The degree of relation between each question in the original form and each SICTQUAL item has been obtained with the cooperation of 5 ICT experts, that is, experts={expert1, …, expertn}, where n=5. These experts have conducted a self-assessment of their degree of expertise as the highest possible, i.e.weights={VH,VH,VH,VH,VH}. They have also issued linguistic assessments by connecting each of the k questions in the questionnaire with the SICTQUAL items, storing these assessments in the assessmentsk, ∀k∈{1, …, p}, withp=28, sets. To do it, the experts have used the following set of labels: s0=NR (Nothing Related), s1=PR (Poorly Related), s2=N (Neutral), s3=SR (Something Related), s4=CR (Closely Related). All the labels used by the experts can be seen in Annex I(c). The use of linguistic labels has greatly helped the experts’ work, since as the questions of the original questionnaire are expressed in natural language, their relation with the SICTQUAL items often leads to a certain degree of doubt, which makes difficult to express it with a precise numerical value.To set some examples, the partial results of two questions randomly selected from the questionnaire are shown below:•Q16. In general, how satisfied are you with the remote customer service that CNT EP offers to its customers?Q23. How easy is it for you to browse CNT EP's website?A sample of the assessments provided by the experts for these two questions is available in Tables 2 and 3respectively. As an example, it is pointed out that expert e1 (E1) assessed the SICTQUAL1 element=C1S1 (i.e. Services–Tangibility) with the linguistic label “Neutral” (N) for question Q16.By applying the LMCDM_2t function to each of these two questions we obtain the result shown in Tables 4 and 5respectively, where it may be observed that the degree of consensus achieved among the experts is high enough for each SICTQUAL item. Likewise, these two tables also show the values of the weights agreed by the experts for each model element or indicator involved in the corresponding question.Phase II. In this phase we already have the weights generated by the experts in the previous phase, which are applied to the overall answers provided by the respondents to the survey form, which is available in Annex I(a). The process of information aggregation is carried out for every user in connection with the answers they provide to these questions.The result of this phase may be observed in Table 6, which shows the linguistic results for two randomly-selected users (users 43 and 358 respectively), by using the appropriate linguistic labels chosen for expressing the results in the model, which can be consulted in Annex I(d).Phase III. In this last phase, the aggregation of information corresponding to the whole group of users is carried out in order to obtain the output of the 16 global indicators that form the SICTQUAL model. The final result is shown in the following figures:In Fig. 5the final (aggregated) results are shown for each of the 16 items of the SICTQUAL model. Each of these obtained elements includes not only the final assessment it received but also the degree of consensus between all the answers collected. Both linguistic values have been represented by using the 2-tuple model.This figure also contains the Overall Satisfaction Index (OSI) item, which may be interpreted as the degree of consensus reached for the assessment of the overall satisfaction level obtained.Fig. 6represents, through a radar chart and by using the labels scale s0=VD, s1=D, s2=N, s3=S, ands4=VS, the final assessments (expressed as a result of applying the function Δ−1 to the 2-tuple value obtained) for each of the 16 items or indicators of the SICTQUAL model.Similarly, Fig. 7shows, through a radar chart and the labels s0=SD, s1=D, s2=N, s3=A, ands4=SA, the consensus reached by users for each of the 16 SICTQUAL items, applying also the function Δ−1 to the corresponding 2-tuple value.The SICTQUAL model groups the service quality indicators assessed in the three identified ICT segments: Services, Applications and Technologies (as seen in Fig. 5). Thus, it is easy to view in such figure the linguistic results obtained for every model item. For example, in this particular case, we can see results that are close to the linguistic label “Neutral” (N) that note the areas to be improved according to the survey respondents. These results are easy to interpret and are of valuable help for decision-makers within the organisation. With the results obtained in this specific case, they know they must pay attention and improve the aspects related to the following elements in the enterprise (pair of ICT segment and assessed quality service indicator) considered in the SICTQUAL model:1.SICTQUAL1 (C1S1): Segment=Services−Indicator=Tangibility.SICTQUAL8 (C2S3): Segment=Applications−Indicator=Responsiveness.SICTQUAL9 (C2S4): Segment=Applications−Indicator=Assurance.SICTQUAL15 (C3S5): Segment=Technologies−Indicator=Empathy.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This work proposes a new linguistic multi-criteria model, called SICTQUAL, to measure, assess and analyse the quality of services in the ICT sector from the user perspective. It is characterised for providing information on the different aspects of service quality in all the main ICT segments, using a group of 16 items or indicators that integrate the model.SICTQUAL may be applied to information gathered from surveys created with this specific model. However, perhaps its most interesting aspect is that it may also be applied to previously conducted surveys (historical surveys) through the process designed for this.An application of the proposed model has also been presented to a case of study corresponding to a real decision-making scenario in the ICT sector in Ecuador, showing each step of the phases carried out in the model and some of the intermediate results obtained, as well as how are they used for obtaining the final output of the model.From the experience obtained through the application of this model to several case studies in the ICT sector, it may be concluded that:•SICTQUAL is a tool that provides relevant information on the problem to be addressed, providing also the view of users from an innovative perspective.The model shows, in a practical and specific way, the assessments that correspond to the different indicators taken into account when measuring the quality of service within the different ICT segments identified in the model.The application of this model supports decision-making in the organisation or enterprise that uses it.It may be implemented both by service operators in the ICT area and by regulation and control bodies.The model may be implemented in many developing countries and, in general, wherever there is a deficiency in the quality of the ICT services provided, since it helps to identify the areas to be improved.It raises awareness in society and especially among service providers on the different factors involved in the quality of ICT services.In view of the foregoing, we may conclude that the model offers the following advantages:•Regardless of the number of questions to be analysed, there is always a standard output formed by 16×2 clearly identified elements.It allows to carry out an analysis over time (past–present–future) on the ICT service quality from a user perspective and to observe the evolution of the results obtained by applying the SICTQUAL model.It focuses on a segment of the economy that does not have, for the moment, a standard model to assess the quality of the service provided.It is flexible in terms of use by the experts who need to assess the survey replies, since it is a computer system that does not require onsite experts.It can handle any type of questions with answers that are expressed through a Likert linguistic scale.It provides valuable information to ICT service providers.It easily provides a quality control function for these types of services to government bodies who must regulate and ensure their control.Having presented SICTQUAL as a new model for the analysis of the quality of ICT services from the user's perspective, the goal is to continue its development by adding new models or functionalities that allow obtaining automatic information from other information sources such as: social networks, call centres, websites, etc. This would provide a practically instantaneous mechanism to assess the quality of service from the customer's view. We are especially considering the possibility of extracting information from social networks because people express more freely complaints about received services on social networks than in official surveys [81,82]. We also aim to apply this model to different problems or case studies within the ICT sector. Additionally, we would like to disseminate it on different scientific, business and political forums in order to have this model welcomed by the bodies responsible of regulating and controlling ICT services in different countries, mainly Latin America. This would avoid distortions that might have an impact on the study and analysis of the development of new technologies due to the lack of an assessment standard.To mitigate the effect caused by some users who could fill out the survey questionnaires without a deep reflexion on the questions they are answering, validation questions (which are dependent on previous ones) could be added to the questionnaires created for the model here presented. Thus, we could know whether user answers are reliable by checking such dependencies.Moreover, as there exist some extensions of fuzzy sets, such as hesitant fuzzy sets [83–85], and intuitionistic fuzzy sets [86–88], an interesting future research line would be to apply such extensions instead of ordinary fuzzy sets to the model presented in this article. Thus, we could check if there are significant differences in the results obtained with the models based on the mentioned extended fuzzy sets with respect to those obtained with the SICTQUAL model here presented.
