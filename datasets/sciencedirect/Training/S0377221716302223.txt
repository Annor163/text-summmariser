@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We provide a new portfolio decomposition formula that sheds light on the economics of portfolio choice for investors following the mean-variance (MV) criterion. We show that the number of components of a dynamic portfolio strategy can be reduced to two: the first is preference free and hedges the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon while the second hedges the time variation in pseudo relative risk tolerance. Both components entail strong horizon effects in the dynamic asset allocation as a result of time-varying risk tolerance and investment opportunity sets. We also provide closed-form solutions for the optimal portfolio strategy in the presence of market return predictability. The model parameters are estimated over the period 1963 to 2012 for the U.S. market. We show that (i) intertemporal hedging can be very large, (ii) the MV criterion hugely understates the true extent of risk aversion for high values of the risk aversion parameter, and the more so the shorter the investment horizon, and (iii) the efficient frontiers seem problematic for investment horizons shorter than one year but satisfactory for large horizons. Overall, adopting the MV model leads to acceptable results for medium and long term investors endowed with medium or high risk tolerance, but to very problematic ones otherwise.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The mean-variance (hereafter MV) criterion is by far the most widely used in the asset allocation industry. It is also present in several strands of the finance literature, not to mention textbooks. Apart from the Gaussian case, where it is rigorously derived for a von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility maximizer, its theoretical foundation, which goes back to Markowitz’s(1952, 1959) pioneering work, lies in the classic Arrow–Pratt approximation of certainty equivalent wealth for such an investor. Recent extensions in a static framework include Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Ruffino (2013) who introduce ambiguity in the standard portfolio analysis. Markowitz (2014) himself offers a recent and rather comprehensive review of the relative merits of the criterion. Cochrane (2014) provides explanations as to why the Markowitz’s one-period MV framework is and should be widely adopted in practice as a useful characterization of an optimal portfolio. In particular, he argues that, although the variance of the portfolio return is admittedly not an ideal risk measure, the MV formulation still is the cornerstone of real-world portfolio and risk management11It is also widely used in many other fields, see Aouam, Rardin, and Abrache (2010) and Aouam, Muthuraman, and Rardin (2016).as it provides a simple conceptual benchmark.The extension of Markowitz’s(1952) static setting to a much more difficult dynamic version has also been the object of extensive research. The desirability of a discrete multiperiod or continuous time modeling stems from both the theoretical economic relevance, emphasized by Merton (1971), of intertemporal hedging demands and convincing empirical evidence that the latter are a significant part of long-term investors’ total demand for risky assets.22See, among others, Brennan and Xia (2002).Following the early start of Bajeux-Besnainou and Portait (1998), various solutions to the dynamic MV problem have been provided. For instance, Björk, Murgoci, and Zhou (2014) recently proposed a generalization of the time-consistent solution of Basak and Chabakauri (2010) which allows the parameter γ that controls the tradeoff between the expected value of wealth and its variance in the MV framework to be state dependent rather than constant. Qin (2015) solved the portfolio problem in a more general setting where asset returns are either random or uncertain variables. Yao, Li, and Li (2016) proposed a solution in discrete rather than continuous time.In spite of these advances, two issues still require investigation in a dynamic setting. The first is, in actual implementation of the portfolio strategy, the accuracy, and maybe even the relevance, of the MV approximation. Let the investor’s preferences be expressed asE[x]−γ2σ2[x],where x denotes wealth, E expectation, σ2 variance and γ a positive parameter. In virtually all the literature, γ is treated as a constant and, by a misleading abuse of language, called the risk aversion parameter. In fact, the role of commonly defined risk aversion in the MV portfolio strategy cannot be shown explicitly [Bajeux-Besnainou and Portait (1998) and Nielsen and Vassalou (2006)]. Assuming a constant γ parameter constitutes in itself a paradigm that is virtually impossible to gauge within the usual utility framework since a simple index of risk aversion does not exist for the MV criterion.The second issue concerns the portfolio decomposition formula and its economic interpretation. In Merton (1971), the optimal strategy is broken down into a speculative mean-variance component and as many intertemporal hedges as there are state variables affecting the investment opportunity set. Since then, numerous efforts have been devoted to identifying settings that allow more tractable exact or approximate solutions. Using the martingale approach of Cox and Huang (1989), Lioui and Poncet (2001), Wachter(2002, 2003), Detemple, Garcia, and Rindisbacher (2003), and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) proposed an alternative breakdown of the portfolio strategy for monotonic utility functions, particularly the power utility function. Under stochastic interest rates, the strategy is shown to contain three components only, irrespective of the number of state variables: a speculative mean-variance component, a hedge against the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon, and a hedge against changes in the market prices of risk.33This last component can be related to a particular martingale measure. See Lioui and Poncet (2001) and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010) for details.These results, however, do not apply to the MV criterion because it does not belong to the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) class.The first objective of this paper is to propose a new decomposition formula for the MV criterion. We first develop an original formula for an investor endowed with quadratic utility (QU hereafter) and infer a similar decomposition for the MV criterion by analogy.44The literature sometimes uses interchangeably “quadratic utility” and “mean-variance preferences”. We adopt the first phrasing exclusively to avoid confusion with Markowitz’s ([1952,1959]) “mean-variance criterion”. In a dynamic setting, the optimal portfolio strategies for these two utility representations (QU and MV) can be very different, as will be shown in Sections 2 and 3.The QU function, with a proper restriction on the relevant domain, belongs to the rather large HARA class and the results derived from it can be directly compared to those obtained with CRRA preferences. This is important as power utility is by far the standard assumption in this strand of literature.55Power utility or its extension by Epstein and Zin (1989) is the workhorse of the dynamic asset allocation literature. See Detemple (2014) for a lucid literature review.While numerous recent contributions have completed our understanding of the CRRA case, we still have some way to fully comprehend the practically important dynamic MV criterion and its economic underpinnings. The adoption of QU as a benchmark to investigate the MV criterion is a natural choice since only the first two moments of the investor’s wealth distribution enter the utility function.We show that both QU and MV dynamic strategies can be decomposed in two elements only. One is a preference-free term that hedges the risk (volatility) of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The other hedges the random time variation in the investor’s relative risk tolerance. Thus, both display horizon effects while, under CRRA, only the intertemporal hedging element exhibits such an effect. Our new decomposition highlights in particular the crucial role of the investor’s relative risk tolerance. The formal difference between QU and MV, which can be decisive in practical allocations (analyzed in Section 3), lies unsurprisingly in the definition of relative risk tolerance. For QU, our definition directly derives from the quadratic preferencesx−γ2x2. For MV, we must define a relative pseudo risk tolerance that involves additionally the investor’s unconditional expectation of optimal terminal wealth.The second, related objective of the paper is to provide an empirical assessment of the quality of the MV approximation to QU, and shed light on the practical importance of horizon effects. This in itself bridges a gap in the literature. We adopt in the empirical section an incomplete market setting that leads to explicit solutions to the optimal dynamic strategies for QU and MV criterion. A riskless asset and the market portfolio are available for trade. The excess return on the market is an affine function of a predictor, the dividend yield, which follows an Ornstein–Ulhenbeck process. Portfolio strategies are shown to be non-linear in the predictor, in contrast with Kim and Omberg’s(1996) well known finding that the CRRA investor’s strategy is linear.Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Horizon effects are always sizeable and may be huge, as intertemporal hedging is very large, many times more than reported in the literature under CRRA.66See for instance Xia (2001) or Detemple (2014).The horizon-dependence of the relative risk tolerance is the key driver of these effects. (ii) The optimal MV strategy is always tilted, as compared to QU, toward a more risky position. The MV criterion can hugely understate the true extent of risk aversion. The tilt is much more pronounced for short investment horizons and for low levels of risk tolerance. (iii) Positions in the risky asset and certainty equivalent return rates strikingly differ for the MV and QU strategies for short investment horizons and low risk tolerance. They converge, however, as the horizon enlarges and risk tolerance increases. (iv) The efficient frontiers for both preference specifications have the same slopes for all investment horizons, but their ranges differ markedly for horizons up to 12 months. As the horizon enlarges, however, they also tend to converge to one another. In brief, the MV approximation yields misleading results for investment horizons smaller than 1 year and low risk tolerance levels, but is acceptable otherwise.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we derive, in a complete market framework, the optimal portfolio strategy of an investor endowed with QU and compare it to that of an investor obeying a MV criterion. Within a standard affine setting and an incomplete market, Section 3 provides an explicit portfolio solution for both utility specifications, then reports and analyzes the parameter estimates, the optimal strategies, the certainty equivalent return rates, and the efficient frontiers for the period spanning January 1926 to December 2012 in the US. The last section concludes. The main technical derivations are left to an Internet Appendix.We first describe the economy in which trading takes place and then derive the new portfolio decomposition formulas for the QU and MV investors.Investors can freely trade continuously in an arbitrage-free and frictionless financial market. Their investment horizon is denoted by T. Available for trade are N risky assets and a locally riskless asset. The excess returns on the risky assets are assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation(1)dSi,tSi,t−rtdt=μi,tdt+Σi,t′dBt,where Siis the price of risky asset i,i=1,...N,μi, tthe risk premium, Σi, ta N × 1 volatility vector, Btan N-dimensional standard Brownian motion, and rtthe risk-free rate. The latter obeys a general (unspecified but well behaved) stochastic process. Hence the uncertainty is formalized by the complete filtered probability space (Ω, F,{Ft}tϵ[0,T],P), where Ω is the state space, F is the σ-algebra representing measurable events, P is the actual (historical) probability measure and the filtration, to which investors have access, is the augmented filtration generated by the Brownian motion assumed to satisfy the usual conditions [Karatzas and Shreve (1991), p. 89]. We make the usual assumptions on the processes rt, μi, tand Σi, t(for all i,i=1,...,N) so that a solution to (1) exists and is unique [Karatzas and Shreve (1991), pp. 285–289]. Since the state space is infinite, all statements in this paper are to be understood as true almost surely (a.s.).The law of motion of an investor’s wealth writes(2)dWtWt=∑i=1Nωi,tdSi,tSi,t+(1−∑i=1Nωi,t)rtdt,where ωi, tis the proportion of wealth invested in the ith risky asset.77For simplicity, we assume no intermediate consumption and solve for a pure dynamic asset allocation problem, the so called terminal wealth case.Using (1), this wealth dynamics (2) rewrites(3)dWtWt=[rt+∑i=1Nωi,tμi,t]dt+(∑i=1Nωi,tΣi,t′)dBt,or(4)dWtWt=[rt+ωt′μt]dt+(Σtωt)′dBt,where ωtis the N × 1 vector of weights andΣt≡[Σ1,t,…,ΣN,t]the N × N volatility matrix. Σtis assumed to be uniformly invertible for all t and all states of the world.The interest rate and risk premia are time-varying. In this section, we assume for simplicity that this time variation is brought about only by the N sources of risk present in the economy. Consequently, as N non redundant risky assets are available for trade, and Σtis uniformly invertible, the financial market is complete [Björk (2009), pp. 199–200]. This assumption makes the derivation of the investor’s optimal decision easy (Cox & Huang, 1989) and comes with no loss of economic intuition as to our theoretical message.88As shown by He and Pearson (1991), in a general setting, the martingale approach is technically much simpler in a complete market than in an incomplete one. In addition, portfolio decomposition formulas are easier to obtain with the martingale approach than with the stochastic dynamic programming method. Since the simpler complete market setting is well suited to the issue we want to focus on at a theoretical level, we adopt it in this section. In the empirical part, however, we will adopt a more realistic, incomplete market setting.The pricing kernel (or stochastic discount factor, or state price deflator) under the measure P, Λt, t ∈ [0, T], thus is unique [Björk (2009), p. 155] and obeys the dynamics(5)dΛtΛt=−rtdt−θt′dBt,where(6)θt≡Σt−1μtis the vector of market prices of risk and all the involved processes(rt, μt, Σt) are adapted to the filtration{Ft}tϵ[0,T].Consider an investor endowed with a QU function defined over terminal wealth WT. Following Cox and Huang (1989), the investor’s program is formulated as(7)maxWTE0P[WT−γ2WT2]s.t.E0P[ΛTWT]=W0,whereE0P[.]is the unconditional (as of time zero) expectation under the actual probability measure, γ is a strictly positive parameter (loosely) related to risk aversion and Λ the pricing kernel. The budget constraint is that the present value of terminal wealth cannot exceed initial wealth. It is assumed to be binding (which is reflected by the equal sign). Since the QU function is strictly concave, the solution to this program is guaranteed to exist and be unique. This restriction is required for the Cox and Huang (1989) method to be applicable.99Cox and Huang (1989) derive the conditions under which a given finite supremum is reached for program (7). In particular, see their Theorem 2.1, pp. 48–49.The program’s first-order condition is(8)1−γWT*−λΛT=0⇔WT*=1γ(1−λΛT),where λ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint. Note that throughout the paper, the symbol “*” denotes an optimal value. Using (8) and the budget constraint, we obtain(9)E0P[ΛTWT*]=E0P[ΛT1−λΛTγ]=W0.Therefore, the Lagrange multiplier is equal to(10)λ=E0P[ΛTγ]−W0E0P[ΛT2γ]=E0P[ΛT]−γW0E0P[ΛT2],and depends on the agent’s initial wealth, horizon and γ and on the investment opportunity set.For the investor’s problem to make economic sense (see the discussion below Eq. (11)), the following inequalities must hold(11)1γ>W0P(0,T)⇔E0P[ΛTγ]>W0,whereP(0,T)=E0P[ΛT]is the initial price of a pure discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. Note that although this bond may not be traded, the investor can replicate (reach) it using the available stocks and the riskless asset since the market is complete.The condition on the risk parameter γ implied by the first inequality in (11) is economically intuitive. The upper bound to be imposed on the QU agent’s wealth so that marginal utility increases is equal to1γ. For the investor’s problem (7) to be meaningful, this upper bound has to be larger than what he would obtain by investing all his wealth in the discount bond of maturity T. If not, he would simply invest the discounted value of1γin the T-maturity bond and throw away the remaining wealth: the bliss point, or nirvana [in the phrasing of Kim and Omberg (1996)], would be attained. Obviously, such situations have to be ruled out. Now, from the second inequality in (11), it follows that the Lagrange multiplier λ given by (10) is strictly positive. Therefore, saying that λ is strictly positive and stating that the solution to program (7) lies on the increasing part of the QU function are equivalent propositions.We thus will ensure, in the empirical application presented in Section 3, that the (exogenous) level of wealth and γ parameter respect condition (11). In particular, γ must not only depend on initial wealth but also on the investment horizon.The time t value of the investor’s optimal wealth is such thatΛtWt*=EtP[ΛTWT*],whereEtP[.]is the conditional expectation under the actual probability measure, conditional on information available at time t. Therefore, using (8), we have(12)Wt*=1γEtP[ΛTΛt(1−λΛT)]=1γ(P(t,T)−λΛtEtP[ΛT2Λt2]),where P(t, T) is the time t price of the discount bond maturing at T. Note that Eq. (12) is in closed form, as the only endogenous variable (λ) depends on the known, exogenous elements γ and W0. Applying Ito’s lemma to this optimal wealth and usingλ1γΛtEtP[ΛT2Λt2]=1γP(t,T)−Wt*to eliminate the Lagrange multiplier yields(13)dWt*Wt*=(.)dt+[1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*θt−1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*ΣΘ,t+1γP(t,T)Wt*ΣP,t]′dBt,where ΣP, tdenotes the N × 1 volatility vector of relative changes in P(t, T) and ΣΘ, tdenotes the N × 1 volatility vector of relative changes in the conditional expectationEtP[ΛT2Λt2]=1Λt2EtP[ΛT2].1010Denote by dX(t)/X(t) the relative change in variable X(t). In our framework, we havedX(t)/X(t)=(.)dt+ΣX,t′dBt,where we call the N × 1 vector ΣX, tthe volatility vector.Identifying the volatility components of (13) and (4), transposing vectors and matrices, and premultiplying through by(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′leads to our first result.1111To obtainωt*fromΣtωt*,we premultiply by(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′instead of byΣt−1,in spite of the fact that the market is complete and Σtinvertible. The reason is that we want to recover the standard covariance-variance ratios which have a straightforward economic interpretation.Proposition 1The optimal portfolio strategy for the quadratic utility investor is given by(14)ωt*=1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′θt−1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣΘ,t+1γP(t,T)Wt*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t.Eq. (14) emphasizes the role of the relative gap between the discounted bliss wealth1γP(t,T)and the actual optimal wealthWt*. The optimal strategy has three components. Using standard terminology, the first one is the so-called myopic, speculative, or mean-variance term. Unique to the present framework, however, and noteworthy, is the horizon effect embedded in this component through the presence of the T-maturity discount bond. The second component is an intertemporal hedging term that hedges random changes in the conditional expectation of the (squared) terminal pricing kernel which affect current optimal wealth. Squaring stems from the squared wealth that enters the utility function. The last component, which depends on the ratio of bliss wealth over actual optimal wealth, is also an intertemporal hedge against changes in the return of the T-maturity discount bond.This decomposition inherits the same intuitive interpretation of an optimal portfolio strategy as that offered by Lioui and Poncet (2001), Wachter (2002, 2003), Detemple et al. (2003), and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010). Merton (1971) had shown previously that non-myopic investors trade risky assets for both speculative and intertemporal hedging purposes. The intertemporal hedges are preference-dependent and designed to account for unfavorable shifts in the investment opportunity set brought about by the state variables. These hedging terms are therefore as numerous as the assumed state variables. Although elegant and intuitive, Merton’s original paradigm is difficult to implement, as it provides no guidance as to what is the set of state variables relevant to investors. As a result, intensive follow-up research has suggested alternative decompositions for the optimal portfolio strategy. Lioui and Poncet (2001) and Detemple and Rindisbacher (2010), for example, show that in an economy with an arbitrary number of state variables, and investors endowed with power utility, the optimal strategy has three components only. The first is the mean-variance component. The other two are intertemporal hedging terms, one to hedge against changes in a complex variable involving the stochastic market prices of risk, and the other against variations in the return on the discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The decomposition in Proposition 1 thus recovers three elements analogous (but not identical) to those obtained with power utility.Our next step is to provide an even simpler decomposition that has an intuitive economic interpretation in terms of risk tolerance. To develop the intuition, we first rewrite Eq. (14) as(15)ωt*=(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t+(1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*)×(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′[θt+ΣP,t−ΣΘ,t].Then we note that in a static framework quadratic utility (W−γ2W2) implies a relative risk tolerance equal to1γ−WW. In a dynamic setting, we similarly define the investor’s relative risk tolerance at horizon T as(16)RTT≡1γ−WTWT.His optimal terminal wealth is therefore equal to(17)WT*=1γ(11+RTT*).His optimal wealth at time t then is given by(18)Wt*=EtP[ΛTΛtWT*]=1γEtP[ΛTΛt(1−RTT*1+RTT*)]=1γP(t,T)−1γEtP[ΛTΛtRTT*1+RTT*].The expectation present in (18) can be rewritten asEtP[ΛTΛtRTT*1+RTT*]=P(t,T)EtP[ΛTΛtP(T,T)P(t,T)RTT*1+RTT*]=P(t,T)EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*],where QTis the T-forward-neutral martingale measure associated with the zero-coupon bond P(t, T) as numéraire [see Jamshidian (1993)], i.e. the probability measure defined bydQTdP=ΛTΛtP(T,T)P(t,T)=ΛTΛt1P(t,T),withEtP[ΛTΛt]=P(t,T).Then, time-t optimal wealth becomes(19)Wt*=1γP(t,T)(1−EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]).For convenience, we call adjusted risk tolerance the ratioRTT*/(1+RTT*). The crucial message of Eq. (19) is that optimal wealth deviates from its current bliss value1γP(t,T)to an extent that depends on the investor’s expectation as to his adjusted risk tolerance at terminal date T. The larger is γ, the smaller is the bliss point, obviously. The lower is his risk tolerance, the smaller is the gap between nirvana and actual wealth because a lower fraction of wealth is invested in the risky asset for speculative purposes. In addition, if the current expectation of terminal wealth is higher, the gap is also reduced because the conditional expectation of adjusted risk tolerance is lower.Applying Ito’s lemma to Eq. (19) yields(20)dWt*Wt*=(.)dt+dP(t,T)P(t,T)−EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]1−EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]dEtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*],or else(21)dWt*Wt*=(.)dt+[ΣP,t−EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]1−EtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]ΣRT,t]′dBt,where ΣRT, tdenotes the N × 1 volatility vector, under the historical probability P, of the relative changes in the conditional QT-expectation of terminal adjusted risk toleranceEtQT[RTT*1+RTT*]. This expectation is a martingale under QT, but not under P. Note that the dynamics of optimal wealth still involves the initial Brownian motion Btassociated with P. By Girsanov’s theorem, however, the volatility vector ΣRT, tis the same under the two probability measures.Matching the diffusion parameters of Eqs. (4) and (21) and rearranging terms provides the second representation of the optimal portfolio strategy:Proposition 2The optimal portfolio strategy for the quadratic utility investor is, alternatively, given by(22)ωt*=(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t−1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣRT,t.This proposition is one of the main results of this paper. As claimed, we are left with two terms only. The first is a pure hedge ratio associated with the T-maturity discount bond. It is preference-free, unlike the third term of Eq. (14), incorporates nonetheless an horizon effect, and is identical to the first term of Eq. (15). We thus uncover the result that the truly riskless asset from the investor’s standpoint is precisely the long term bond of duration T, regardless of his risk aversion. The second term is preference- and horizon-dependent and hedges the fluctuations in relative risk tolerance. It summarizes the influence of the unforecastable error on future risk tolerance, which itself embeds the speculative term and the intertemporal hedges against the fluctuations of the interest rate and the market prices of risk. Consequently, the investor’s relative position in the risky asset would not depart from the pure hedge ratio if his relative risk tolerance was constant or deterministic. This could happen only if all the wealth was invested in the T-maturity bond (nirvana). In other words, we have established that for the dynamic model to be consistent, relative risk tolerance must be a stochastic process.When risk tolerance tends to zero, the optimal strategy boils down to a position in the T-maturity discount bond for both CRRA utility and QU, although not for the same reason. In the standard CRRA case, sticking to the riskless asset when risk aversion is very large reflects the (too) huge premium required implicitly to invest in risky assets. With QU, sticking to the riskless asset is due to the fact that all the benefits of previous risky investments have been reaped (the wealth upper bound is hit) so that the investor retracts from the stock market, while the CRRA investor did not even enter it. Consequently, the traditional decomposition under CRRA is not well suited to the QU investor in a dynamic framework.Since both components of the optimal strategy (22) are horizon-dependent, it is extremely likely that horizon effects in the QU case are quite substantial, and to a greater extent than is routinely acknowledged in the literature. We will confirm this intuition in the empirical section.Consider now an investor endowed with a MV objective function. She solves(23)maxWTE0P[W^T]−γ2Var0P[W^T],s.t.E0P[ΛTW^T]=W^0,where the symbol “^” differentiates this investor from the QU agent, and γ is a parameter that controls the tradeoff between the expected value of terminal wealth and its variance. To make comparisons fruitful, we keep it equal to the γ encountered in the previous case. Although this parameter reflects attitude towards risk, it cannot be interpreted in a dynamic setting as an absolute risk aversion coefficient, even though utility were exponential and wealth normally distributed. We follow Basak and Chabakauri (2010), whose approach allows for a solution in the general case of a stochastic opportunity set. In Internet Appendix A, we derive the following optimal strategy that generalizes Proposition 4 of Basak and Chabakauri (2010) to stochastic interest rates and market prices of risk.1212Their Eq. (38) is a special case under precommitment. It has one term, which corresponds to our first term in Eq. (24). They also provide an analytical characterization of the optimal time-consistent strategy in a more general, incomplete market setting (Proposition 2, Eq. (26)). The r.h.s. of Eq. (26) has three terms, as here.Proposition 3The optimal, precommitment portfolio strategy for the mean-variance investor is given by(24)ω^t*=E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)+1γP(t,T)−W^t*W^t*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′θt+E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)+1γP(t,T)W^t*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t−E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)+1γP(t,T)−W^t*W^t*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣΘ,t.The optimal portfolio strategy of the MV investor, Eq. (24), which is time inconsistent, and that of the QU investor, Eq. (14), which is consistent, differ by the additional elementE0P[W^T*]P(t,T)in the numerator of all three terms. Time inconsistency precisely stems from the possible incentive to deviate ex post from the ex ante optimal policy.1313A recent paper by Dang and Forsyth (2016) proposes an approach that leads to better efficient frontiers than those implied by precommitment strategies. Their strategies are semi-self-financing only in that cash withdrawals from the optimal portfolio are allowed.This is not the case for standard utility functions for which the time-consistent and precommitment policies coincide.1414It is instructive to compare Eq. (24) with Basak and Chabakauri’s (2010) time-consistent solution in the special case of one risky asset and constant interest rate and market price of risk (implying here ΣP, t=ΣΘ,t=0). Expressed in dollar terms, Eq. (24) becomesω^t*W^t*=(1γP(t,T)+E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)−W^t*)(μ−rσ2),while their Eq. (41) is, using our notation,ω^t*W^t*=1γP(t,T)(μ−rσ2).Therefore, their speculative term is proportional to the (discounted) inverse of the γ parameter, while ours is proportional to that inverse augmented by the gap between the (discounted) initial expectation of terminal wealth and current wealth.The MV objective function can be rewritten as the quadratic objective function augmented by the squared expectation of wealth (times γ/2), i.e.(25)E0P[WT]−γ2Var0P[WT]=E0P[WT−γ2WT2]+γ2E0P[WT]2.For given initial wealth and γ parameter, the MV criterion presents an additional, positive term as compared to QU. Its effect is more readily apparent if we rewrite the optimal strategies (24) for MV and (15) for QU, respectively, as(26)ω^t*−(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t=1γP(t,T)−W^t*+E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)W^t*×(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′[θt+ΣP,t−ΣΘ,t],and(27)ωt*−(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t=1γP(t,T)−Wt*Wt*×(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′[θt+ΣP,t−ΣΘ,t].The l.h.s. of both equations represents the optimal weight invested in the risky assets net of the wealth-independent, hedging weight. Hence the r.h.s. of the equations represents the risky component of the strategy that depends on the investor’s time-varying wealth and risk aversion. In the QU case, this net weight is proportional to the relative gap between nirvana and current wealth. For the MV investor, for whom there is no actual nirvana, it is proportional to the relative gap between the hypothetical quadratic nirvana and current wealth augmented by the relative discounted initial expectation of optimal terminal wealth. It is as if the MV investor kept an eye on two targets, the hypothetical bliss point and the optimal wealth she had expected initially. The further away her current wealth is from these targets, the higher becomes her risk tolerance (see below), which induces her to invest relatively more in the risky assets.SinceW^0*=W0*=W0,at the inception of the strategies the ratio of the two wealth-dependent net weights (MV over QU) is equal toα0≡(E0P[W^T*]P(0,T)1γP(0,T)−W0+1)≫1.When the gap between nirvana and actual wealth (1γP(0,T)−W0)is narrow, i.e. when γ is large, theory thus predicts that the ratio will also tend to be large. Findings discussed in the empirical section vindicate this result.The difference in the optimal strategies (15) for QU and (24) for MV is narrowly linked to the investor’s attitude towards risk. The challenge here is to define the risk aversion of a MV “precommitted” investor solving (23).1515See Wagener (2003) for an elaboration on this crucial point.The same remark holds for the time-consistent solution developed by Basak and Chabakauri (2010). Risk aversion or tolerance cannot be defined in the usual way under the MV criterion in a dynamic setting since the objective function in (23) does not write as the expectation of some utility of terminal wealth. Still, as shown in Internet Appendix A, we can obtain a second portfolio decomposition similar to that of Proposition 2 for QU by defining a relative pseudo risk tolerance.Proposition 4The optimal, precommitment portfolio strategy for the mean-variance optimizing investor is also given by(28)ω^t*=(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,t−1γP(t,T)−W^t*+E0P[W^T*]P(t,T)W^t*(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣRT^,t,where the relative pseudo risk toleranceRT^Tat terminal dateT is defined as(29)RT^T≡1γ−W^T*+E0P[W^T*]W^T,and whereΣRT^,tdenotes the volatility of the relative changes in the conditional expectation of terminal (adjusted) relative pseudo risk toleranceEtQT[RT^T*1+RT^T*].Definition (29) differs from the one used for QU,RTT≡1γ−WTWT,in the exact same way the r.h.s. of Eqs. (26) and (27) differ, given thatP(T,T)=1.Equipped with this definition, we can interpret the MV optimal portfolio policy in essentially the same way as the QU one, which provides one justification of our investigation of the latter. The measure of MV pseudo risk tolerance is the QU risk tolerance tilted by the ratio αt. Accordingly, and since α0 > 1, at inception of the strategy the MV investor’s risk tolerance is higher than that of the QU individual and the proportion of risky asset held in the optimal portfolio is larger. As discussed above, however, for long investment horizons, αtmay become smaller than one if the two optimal wealths diverge, which again makes room for the empirical evidence to decide.Unlike what is found for CRRA utility, we have shown that the dynamic strategy for the QU and the MV investor can be decomposed in two elements only. The first is preference-free and hedges the risk of a discount bond maturing at the investor’s horizon. The second hedges the random time variation in the investor’s relative risk tolerance or relative pseudo risk tolerance. Both components are horizon-dependent. The difference between the QU and MV cases lies, not surprisingly, in the definition of relative risk tolerance. Now, even though we suspect that the MV individual will substantially invest in the risky asset, both in absolute and in relative (to the QU case) terms, it remains to assess how this translates in terms of welfare, i.e. in certainty equivalent return rates. Our empirical analysis will also shed light on this issue.This section is devoted to assessing the practical implication of our theoretical findings regarding the differences in portfolio compositions, optimal wealths and optimal certainty equivalent return rates between the MV and QU investors, for various degrees of risk aversion and investment horizons. Without loss of intuitive content, we subsume the set of risky assets to the (unique) equity market portfolio. To alleviate the mathematical burden and the empirical estimation, we assume constant riskfree interest rate and market return volatility.However, we do not assume that the financial market is complete, as the equity premium is driven by a predictor imperfectly correlated with the market return. Since the market is incomplete, and the pricing kernel consequently not unique, we have to derive the price of risk associated with the predictor as part of the solution to the optimization problem. To choose the equivalent martingale measure and the corresponding pricing kernel, we have applied the He and Pearson (1991) fictitious completion argument. The idea is to start by picking up an arbitrary equivalent martingale measure, solve for the portfolio decision using Cox and Huang (1989) as in the previous section, and then select the unique particular measure (the so-called minimax martingale measure) that makes optimal wealth not load on the risks that are not spanned by existing assets and thus are unhedgeable. We provide the solutions for both utility specifications, then present the data and the adopted estimation procedure, and finally discuss our empirical results.The excess return on the market portfolio Stis assumed to evolve according to the stochastic differential equation(30)dStSt−rdt=μS,tdt+σSdBS,t=(μ0+μ1xt)dt+σSdBS,t,whereμS,t=(μ0+μ1xt)is its time-varying drift and σSits instantaneous conditional volatility, assumed constant for tractability. Note that its square computed over a finite interval (σS2t) is not the market unconditional variance for this interval since the expected excess return μS, tis stochastic. BS, tis a standard Brownian motion under the historical probability.We assume, as for instance Kim and Omberg (1996), Wachter (2002) and Brennan and Xia (2010), that the equity market risk premium varies linearly in some predictor(s). Although our framework could accommodate any number of such predictors, to keep the model tractable we consider a univariate predictive regression. Our predictor is denoted by xt. Also, in the spirit of much of the literature on dynamic asset allocation1616See Detemple (2014) for a recent review.and on the predictability of asset returns,1717See for instance Sizova (2014) and the references therein, and Koijen and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011) for a review.we assume that the predictor obeys the following Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process(31)dxt=θ(x¯−xt)dt+σx[ρdBS,t+1−ρ2dBx,t],where the standard Brownian motion Bx, trepresents the predictor’s idiosyncratic risk, assumed to be independent from BS, t. It is the presence of this second source of risk that makes the financial market now incomplete (provided ρ ≠ ±1).Following He and Pearson (1991), we set to zero the loading of optimal wealth on the source of risk Bx, tnot spanned by the market portfolio, and derive the following QU investor’s optimal strategy (see Internet Appendix B for details)(32)ωt*=(1γe−r(T−t)−Wt*Wt*)×[μ0+μ1xtσS2−(B(T−t)+C(T−t)xt)σxρσS],where the functionsB(T−t)andC(T−t)are obtained from the system of Eqs. (A.20)–(A.22) derived in Internet Appendix B.Similarly, the MV investor’s optimal decision is shown to be(33)ω^t*=(1γe−r(T−t)+{E0P[W^T*]e−r(T−t)−W^t*}W^t*)×[μ0+μ1xtσS2−(B(T−t)+C(T−t)xt)σxρσS],where the functionsB(T−t)andC(T−t)are shown to be exactly the same as for the QU investor (see Internet Appendix B).Note that, since we have assumed a constant riskless rate (P(t,T)=e−r(T−t)), the hedging term−(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,tappearing in the l.h.s. of Eqs. (26) and (27) vanishes in Eqs. (32) and (33). Therefore, one important aspect of these solutions is that the only difference betweenω^t*andωt*(as was that betweenω^t*−(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,tandωt*−(Σt′Σt)−1Σt′ΣP,tin the theoretical model) lies in the multiplicative term which depends on preferences and wealth.In Internet Appendix B, we also show how to extract from the optimal solutions the Sharpe ratios, i.e. the slopes of the mean-variance Efficient Frontier, the certainty equivalent wealthsCE^T*andCET*and the (yearly) certainty equivalent return ratesceT*andce^T*.The empirical analysis uses US monthly data for the period 1963:M7 to 2012:M12 (594 observations). Data relative to the returns on the market portfolio have been downloaded from Kenneth French’s website. The stock market return is computed as the value-weighted return on all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks obtained from the CRSP data files. The riskless rate is the one-month Treasury bill rate downloaded from the CRSP “Fama Risk Free Rates” data file.We have adopted as the predictor the dividend yield that is routinely used in the literature. The dividend yield is measured as total dividends paid off during the last 12 months divided by the actual value of the value-weighted market portfolio. We selected this measure as monthly or quarterly dividend yields cannot be used because seasonality is predominant. We constructed the dividend yield series from the two series of stock market returns with and without dividends available from CRSP.Panel A of Table 1reports various statistics for the one-month T-bill rate, the excess return on the market portfolio and the dividend yield. All data are monthly, and all rates and returns are non-annualized. For instance, the average risk premium is 0.0035 for the equity market (0.043 per year). We note that the standard deviation of the interest rate is smaller (0.0034) than that of the equity premium (0.0455) by a factor thirteen. Therefore, we will assume for simplicity that the riskfree rate is constant. The large first-order auto-regression coefficient for the predictive variable (0.9898) reflects a high level of persistence. In contrast, the analogous coefficient for the stock market is very small (0.0952). Both are comparable to the ones found in the literature.Our estimation procedure being standard, we leave it to Internet Appendix C.1818See, among others, Kim and Omberg (1996), Xia (2001), Wachter (2002), and Sangvinatsos and Wachter (2005). Note that, unlike Palczewski and Palczewski (2014), we do not tackle the problem of errors arising from the estimation of the covariance matrix and mean vector of asset returns.Data being discrete, we integrate the continuous time dynamics equation (31) for the predictor and Eq. (30) for the market excess return over the discrete time interval [t,t+Δt], the length of Δt being one month. We then identify the integrated process parameters with those of the discrete time processes(34)xt+Δt=ax+Axxt+υx,t+Δt,(35)rS,t+Δt=aS+ASxt+υS,t+Δt.Internet Appendix C explains in detail how to identify the set of desired parametersx¯,θ,σxand ρ for the predictor process and μ0, μ1, andσS2for the equity risk premium process. These seven estimates are reported in panels B and C of Table 1. Results regarding the stock excess return predicted by the dividend yield are close to those reported in the literature. In particular, ρ the correlation between the innovations in the market excess return and those in the dividend yield is found to be−0.906. Also, μ1 is positive as expected from both the theory and what is found in the empirical literature: a higher dividend yield entails a larger expected excess return as the market is underpriced.The time series for the dividend yield, the estimated market expected risk premium and the market realized risk premium appear in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a shows that the dividend yield is somewhat volatile but always contained in the interval [1.06 percent; 5.82 percent] on a yearly basis. The expected market risk premium as predicted by the model (Fig. 1b) is confined to the very small interval [−0.09percent;1.04percent] when expressed on a monthly basis (with an average of 0.35 percent). This is in sharp contrast with the realized risk premium (Fig. 1c) which, with the same average of 0.35 percent, strongly fluctuates between−26.13percent and+14.81percent (typically between ± 10 percent) on the same monthly basis. More generally, Table 2shows that, except for the sample mean, all the other statistics are very different for the expected and the realized risk premium. This implies that the predictability power of the dividend yield is weak at a short return horizon, in accordance with much of the literature on asset return predictability.
