@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
While common digital images provide sufficient 2D information of a scene, several applications including robotics, entertainment and other require full 3D information, such as depth information, which can be accomplished by stereo imaging. Stereo matching is the field of study that aims to determine correspondences in two or more images shot from different viewpoints for obtaining a depth map of the actual scene. This major field of computer vision has been reviewed and categorized accordingly in [1,2] and [3]. Stereo matching techniques can be explicitly classified into two major groups, global and local approaches. The common approach in local algorithms is that the disparity value of a given pixel is calculated only by intensities populating a certain region around that pixel, which is called support window. Several strategies have been introduced to optimize the results of local techniques such as adaptive-weight cost aggregation strategies aiming to reduce implicit assumptions [4]. In global approaches, algorithms determine the disparity values simultaneously based on smoothness assumptions and tend to be iterative for refining their results with energy minimization techniques. The general framework is that local techniques are less computationally expensive than the global techniques and, therefore, they are mostly real time/hardware applicable. Despite this fact, global algorithms can achieve higher accuracy if they deploy cost aggregation techniques in their process. Several applications of belief propagation [5], graph cuts [6] and segmentation combined with plane fitting [7] have been integrated in global and local approaches to boost their performance.In this paper, we present an approach which tackles the stereo matching problem from a novel perspective compared to known techniques. Our inspiration has been derived from the problem of robot localization in a known environment. This problem can be solved accurately by particle filters, where each particle is a possible state of the robot and each state has its own probability of the robot's actual positioning [8]. The probability is calculated by means of linked series of geometrical and spatial information derived from known landmarks in the environment. We address the stereo matching problem with the same technique, where at first we acquire a set of ground control points (GCPs) [9] by computing multiple disparity maps and subsequently we label them as landmarks. Those features possess an extremely precise disparity value and we utilize them for applying the particle filtering context in a scan line for accurate estimation of disparity values. For improving the effectiveness of particle filtering, we first classify each landmark using a segmentation based technique in each of the paired images. Additionally, we introduce a Markov chain model to increase the accuracy and decrease the computational expensiveness of particle filtering. Finally, we refine our results by applying the RANSAC algorithm [10] combined with a histogram technique which, by drawing out the outliers, allows us to obtain high quality disparity maps.
