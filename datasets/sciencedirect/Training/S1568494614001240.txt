@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To the best of our knowledge, there is no method in the literature to find the fuzzy optimal solution of fully fuzzy critical path (FFCP) problems i.e., critical path problems in which all the parameters are represented by LR flat fuzzy numbers. In this paper, a new method is proposed for the same. Also, it is shown that it is better to use JMD representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers in the proposed method as compared to the other representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In today's highly competitive business environment, project management's ability to schedule activities and monitor progress within strict cost, time and performance guidelines is becoming increasingly important to obtain competitive priorities such as on-time delivery and customization. In many situations, projects can be complicated and challenging to manage. When the activity times in the project are deterministic and known, critical path method (CPM) has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in managing projects in an efficient manner to meet this challenge. The purpose of CPM is to identify critical activities on the critical path so that resources may be concentrated on these activities in order to reduce the project length time.The successful implementation of CPM requires the availability of a clear determined time duration for each activity. However, in practical situations this requirement is usually hard to fulfill, since many of activities will be executed for the first time. To deal with such real life situations, Zadeh [25] introduced the concept of fuzzy set. Since there is always uncertainty about the time duration of activities in the network planning, due to which fuzzy critical path method (FCPM) was proposed since the late 1970s.For finding the fuzzy critical path, several approaches are proposed over the past years. The first method called FPERT, was proposed by Chanas and Kamburowski [1]. They presented the project completion time in the form of fuzzy set in the time space. Gazdik [7] developed a fuzzy network of unknown project to estimate the activity durations and used fuzzy algebraic operators to calculate the duration of the project and its critical path. Kaufmann and Gupta [9] devoted a chapter of their book to the critical path method in which activity times are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. McCahon and Lee [20] presented a new methodology to calculate the fuzzy completion project time.Nasution [21] proposed how to compute total floats and find critical paths in a project network. Yao and Lin [24] proposed a method for ranking fuzzy numbers without the need for any assumptions and have used both positive and negative values to define ordering which then is applied to CPM. Dubois et al. [5] extended the fuzzy arithmetic operational model to compute the latest starting time of each activity in a project network. Lin and Yao [17] introduced a fuzzy CPM based on statistical confidence-interval estimates and a signed distance ranking for (1−α)fuzzy number levels. Liu [19] developed solution procedures for the critical path and the project crashing problems with fuzzy activity times in project planning. Liang and Han [16] presented an algorithm to perform fuzzy critical path analysis for project network problem. Zielinski [26] extended some results for interval numbers to the fuzzy case for determining the possibility distributions describing latest starting time for activities. Chen [2] proposed an approach based on the extension principle and linear programming (LP) formulation to critical path analysis in networks with fuzzy activity durations. Chen and Hsueh [3] presented a simple approach to solve the CPM problems with fuzzy activity times (being fuzzy numbers) on the basis of the linear programming formulation and the fuzzy number ranking method that are more realistic than crisp ones. Yakhchali and Ghodsypour [23] introduced the problems of determining possible values of earliest and latest starting times of an activity in networks with minimal time lags and imprecise durations that are represented by means of interval or fuzzy numbers.In this paper, a new method is proposed to find the fuzzy optimal solution of fully fuzzy critical path (FFCP) problems i.e., critical path problems in which all the parameters are represented by LR flat fuzzy numbers. Also, it is shown that it is better to use JMD representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers in the proposed method as compared to the other representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers.This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, some basic definitions and arithmetic operations are presented. In Section 3, linear programming formulation of crisp critical path (CCP) problems and fuzzy critical path (FCP) problems are presented. The linear programming formulation of FFCP problems are proposed in Section 4. In Section 5, a new method is proposed to find the fuzzy optimal solution of FFCP problems and also the validity and advantages of the proposed method is discussed. In Section 6, JMD representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers is presented and advantages of JMD representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers over other existing representation of LR flat fuzzy numbers are discussed. Conclusion is discussed in Section 7.In the literature [6,27], it is pointed out that the computational efforts required to solve a fuzzy linear programming problem can be reduced, if the decision maker express his data using LR flat fuzzy numbers. All kinds of crisp numbers, triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are LR flat fuzzy numbers. So, LR flat fuzzy numbers are frequently used to increase the computational efficiency without limiting the generality beyond the acceptable limits and facilities the ease of acquisition of data to solve real life problems.In this section, some basic definitions and arithmetic operations between two LR flat fuzzy numbers are presented.In this section, some basic definitions are presented.Definition 1[8] Let X be a classical set of objects. Then, the set of ordered pairsA˜={(x,μA˜(x)):x∈X}, whereμA˜:X→[0,1], is called a fuzzy set in X. The evaluation functionμA˜(x)is called the membership function.Definition 2[8] LetA˜be a fuzzy set in X and λ∈[0, 1] be a real number. Then, a classical setAλ={x∈X:μA˜(x)≥λ}is called a λ-level set or λ-cut ofA˜.Definition 3[8] A fuzzy setA˜={(x,μA˜(x)):x∈X}is called a normalized fuzzy set if and only ifSupremumx∈X{μA˜(x)}=1.Definition 4[8] A fuzzy setA˜is called a convex fuzzy set if and only ifμA˜(αx1+(1−α)x2)≥minimum{μA˜(x1),μA˜(x2)}∀x1,x2∈X,α∈[0,1].Definition 5[6] A convex normalized fuzzy setA˜={(x,μA˜(x)):x∈ℝ}on the real lineℝis called a fuzzy number if and only ifμA˜(x)is piecewise continuous inℝ.Definition 6[8] A fuzzy numberA˜is said to be a non-negative fuzzy number if and only ifμA˜(x)=0∀x<0.Definition 7[6] A function L:[0, ∞)→[0, 1] (or R:[0, ∞)→[0, 1]) is said to be reference function of fuzzy number if and only if(i)L(0)=1 (or R(0)=1)L (or R) is non-increasing on [0, ∞).Definition 8[6] A fuzzy numberA˜defined on universal set of real numbersℝ, denoted as(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LR, is said to be an LR flat fuzzy number if its membership functionμA˜(x)is given byμA˜(x)=L(a_−xaL),x≤a_,aL>0R(x−a¯aR),x≥a¯,aR>01,a_≤x≤a¯Definition 9[6] LetA˜=(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRbe an LR flat fuzzy number and α be a real number in the interval [0, 1]. Then, the crisp setAα={x∈X:μA˜(x)≥α}=[a_−aLL−1(α),a¯+aRR−1(α)],is said to be an α-cut ofA˜.Definition 10[6] An LR flat fuzzy numberA˜=(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRis said to be a zero LR flat fuzzy number if and only ifa_=0,a¯=0,aL=0and aR=0.Definition 11[6] Two LR flat fuzzy numbersA1˜=(a1_,a1¯,a1L,a1R)LRandA2˜=(a2_,a2¯,a2L,a2R)LRare said to be equal i.e.,A1˜=A2˜if and only ifa1_=a2_,a1¯=a2¯,a1L=a2Landa1R=a2R.Definition 12[4] An LR flat fuzzy numberA˜=(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRis said to be a non-negative LR flat fuzzy number if and only ifa_−aL≥0.Remark 1Ifa_=a¯then an LR flat fuzzy number(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRis said to be an LR fuzzy number and is denoted as(a_,a_,aL,aR)LRor(a¯,a¯,aL,aR)LRor(a_,aL,aR)LRor(a¯,aL,aR)LR.Remark 2Ifa_=a¯and L(x)=R(x)= maximum {0, 1−x} then an LR flat fuzzy number(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRis said to be a triangular fuzzy number and is denoted as (a, b, c) where,a=a_−aL(ora¯−aL),b=a_(ora¯),c=a_+aR(ora¯+aR).Remark 3Ifa_≠a¯and L(x)=R(x)= maximum {0, 1−x} then an LR flat fuzzy number(a_,a¯,aL,aR)LRis said to be a trapezoidal fuzzy number and is denoted as (a, b, c, d) where,a=a_−aL,b=a_,c=a¯,d=a¯+aR.In this section, some arithmetic operations between two LR flat fuzzy numbers are presented [6].(1)LetA1˜=(a1_,a1¯,a1L,a1R)LRandA2˜=(a2_,a2¯,a2L,a2R)LRbe two LR flat fuzzy numbers. Then,(i)A1˜⊕A2˜=(a1_+a2_,a1¯+a2¯,a1L+a2L,a1R+a2R)LRλA1˜=(λa1_,λa1¯,λa1L,λa1R)LRλ≥0(λa1¯,λa1_,−λa1R,−λa1L)RLλ≤0LetA1˜=(a1_,a1¯,a1L,a1R)LRandA2˜=(a2_,a2¯,a2L,a2R)LRbe two non-negative LR flat fuzzy numbers. Then,A1˜⊗A2˜≃(a1_a2_,a1¯a2¯,a1_a2L+a2_a1L−a1La2L,a1¯a2R+a2¯a1R+a1Ra2R)LRThe CPM is a network-based method designed to assist in the planning, scheduling and control of the project. Its objective is to construct the time scheduling for the project. Two basic results provided by CPM are the total duration time needed to complete the project and the critical path. One of the efficient approach for finding the critical paths and total duration time of project networks is LP. The LP formulation assumes that a unit flow enters the project network at the start node and leaves at the finish node. In this section the LP formulation of CCP problems and FCP problems are presented.Consider a project network G = (N, A) consisting of a finite set N = {1, 2, …, n} of n nodes(events) and A is the set of activities (i, j). Denote tijas the time period of activity (i, j). The LP formulation of CCP problems is as follows [22]:Maximize∑(i,j)∈A(tijxij)subjectto∑j:(i,j)∈Axij=1,i=1,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij=∑j:(j,k)∈Axjk,i≠1,k≠n,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij=1,j=n,xijisanon−negativerealnumber∀(i,j)∈Awhere xijis the decision variable denoting the amount of flow in activity (i, j)∈A, tijis the time duration of activity (i, j) and the constraints represent the conservation of flow at each node.There are several real life problems in which a decision maker may be uncertain about the precise values of activity time. Suppose time parameters tij, (i, j)∈A are imprecise and are represented by fuzzy numberst˜ij, (i, j) ∈ A. Then the FCP problems can be formulated into the following fuzzy linear programming (FLP) problem [19]:Maximize∑(i,j)∈A(tij˜xij)subjectto∑j:(i,j)∈Axij=1,i=1,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij=∑j:(j,k)∈Axjk,i≠1,k≠n,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij=1,j=n,xijisanon−negativerealnumber∀(i,j)∈AThere are several real life problems in which a decision maker may be uncertain about the precise values of activity time. Suppose time parameters tijand xij, (i, j)∈A are imprecise and are represented by fuzzy numberst˜ijandxij˜, (i, j) ∈ A respectively. Then the FFCP problems can be formulated into the following fuzzy linear programming (FLP) problem:Maximize∑(i,j)∈A(tij˜⊗xij˜)subjectto∑j:(i,j)∈Axij˜=1˜,i=1,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij˜=∑j:(j,k)∈Axjk˜,i≠1,k≠n,∑i:(i,j)∈Axij˜=1˜,j=n,xij˜isanon−negativefuzzynumber∀(i,j)∈ARemark 4In this paper, at all places∑(i,j)∈Aλij˜⊗Aij˜and ∑(i,j)∈AλijAijrepresents the addition of fuzzy numbers(λij˜⊗Aij˜)∀(i, j)∈A and addition of real numbers (λijAij) ∀(i, j)∈A respectively.
