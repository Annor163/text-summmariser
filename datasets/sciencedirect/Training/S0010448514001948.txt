@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We model developable surfaces by wrapping a planar figure around cones and cylinders. Complicated developables can be constructed by successive mappings using cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes. We also propose an intuitive control mechanism, which allows a user to select an arbitrary point on the planar figure and move it to a new position. Numerical techniques are then used to find a cone or cylinder that produces the required mapping. Several examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A developable surface is a special type of ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature which can be flattened on to a plane without distortion  [1,2]. Examples include simple surfaces such as cones and cylinders, as well as tangent or rectifying developables derived from spatial curves. Due to their isometric property, developable surfaces have been widely used in applications such as architecture, garment design, sheet metal and origami  [3–5].Typical approaches include the representation of developable as ruled Bézier or B-spline surfaces with non-linear developability constraints  [6–9]. A dual-space approach is mathematically elegant, but it requires significant geometric expertise for an intuitive shape control  [2,6]. Many practical methods have been proposed for constructing developable surfaces from other representations, including point clouds  [10,11], boundary curves  [12,13] and polygonal meshes  [4,5,14,15].Recently, a lot of research  [16–19] has been done on the modeling of paper-like surfaces and simulating their deformations. Kergosien et al.  [16] simulated the bending and creasing of paper-like sheets under external and internal forces. Hong et al.  [17] presented a method for simulating page turning for use in 3D electronic books (e-books). They use a cone of variable angle to simulate the bending of paper while maintaining its developability. However, their method only allows restricted deformations, and does not provide an interactive control mechanism. Bo and Wang  [18] modeled paper bending as a rectifying developable defined by one of its geodesics. More recently, Solomon et al.  [19] proposed a versatile method for constructing developable surfaces with folds, bends and curved folds from a planar fold configuration. For smoothly bent region, they subdivide the rulings and relax them by minimizing mean curvature bending energy.In this paper, we also deal with the problem of paper bending, but take a different approach. We extend the technique of Hong et al.  [17] to a general modeling tool for constructing developable surfaces. We place cones and cylinders on a planar figure with an arbitrary boundary shape, and wrap them in the planar figure to generate a developable surface. Complicated surfaces can easily be obtained by introducing a succession of cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes. We also propose an intuitive control technique, in which a user selects an arbitrary pointpon the planar figure and moves it to a new positionq. Finding a cone or cylinder which mapsptoqallows the subsequent development to appear as a direct manipulation. Selection of the cone or cylinder is formulated as a problem of root finding or optimization of non-linear functions, with only a few control parameters, which can be efficiently solved by a standard numerical technique.The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:•A simple and effective technique for modeling the bending of a sheet of paper using cones and cylinders.A methodology for the successive application of cones and cylinders of different sizes and shapes to produce complicated developable surfaces from an arbitrary planar figure.Interactive control of bending by finding a cone or cylinder which corresponds to a specified displacement by the user.Cones and cylinders are well-known developable surfaces. By using them as primitives for modeling paper bending, we can guarantee that the deformed paper is a developable surface.Cone mapping: We employ a circular coneCOwith half-angleθ. Its apex is located at the origin of a local coordinate system and one generatrix coincides with they-axis of that system, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We are modeling a cone placed on paper, which wraps the cone to an angleβ. The bending region (shown in dark gray in Fig. 1(a)) of the paper is determined by the angleα, which is equal toβsinθ(∵αR=βr).All pointsp=(x,y,0)in the bending region (see Fig. 1(b)) satisfyϕ≤α, whereϕ=arctan(x/y)is the angle between they-axis andop⃗, and these points are mapped to the pointsp′onCOas follows:p′=Rx(θ)Ry(−β0)Rx(−θ)s,whereβ0=ϕ/sinθ,s=(0,(x2+y2),0), andR∗represents a rotation about the corresponding axis. The points in the remaining planar region (ϕ>α, shown in Fig. 1(c)) can be transformed as follows:p′=Rx(θ)Ry(−β)Rx(−θ)Rz(α)p.Cylinder mapping: We employ a circular cylinderCYwith radiusr, which is tangent to thexy-plane of a local coordinate system (see Fig. 2(a)). To model paper being wound around the cylinder by an angleβrequires a bending region of lengthd=rβ. In a similar way to the cone mapping, pointsp=(x,y,0)in the bending region (see Fig. 2(b)) satisfyx≤d, and are mapped to pointsp′onCYas follows:p′=T(0,0,r)Ry(−β0)T(0,0,−r)s,whereβ0=x/r,s=(0,y,0), andT(⋅)represents a 3D translation. Pointsp=(x,y,0)in the planar region (x>d, shown in Fig. 2(c)) can be transformed as follows:p′=T(0,0,r)Ry(−β)T(−d,0,−r)p.Generation of ruling lines: In general, developable surfaces can be represented efficiently by ruling line segments which are straight. Since the paper deformed by cones and cylinders is developable, we compute the ruling line segments and use them to construct a tessellation consisting of strips. On the bending region, ruling lines are obtained by finding the intersections of lines passing through the origin with the paper boundary (see Fig. 4(a)), and the end-points of the resulting line segments are mapped on to a cone or cylinder as appropriate. To preserve the sharp corner of bending region, we force some ruling lines to pass through corner-points (see blue one in Fig. 4(a)). Regions where the paper remains flat are modeled by their transformed corner-points (shown in red in Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) shows how a bent piece of paper is modeled by ruling line segments and transformed planar regions. Fig. 4(c) shows the result of mapping a tiled texture on to a model of bent paper and we see that no distortion is apparent.Our technique provides a compact representation as well as computational efficiency, because only a few intersection points are involved in transformation and tessellation, and the number of ruling line segments can interactively be controlled by the user at runtime. It would be quite inefficient if tessellation preceded transformation, as shown in Fig. 4(d).Fig. 3shows how complicated deformations of paper can be modeled by successive mappings using several different cones and cylinders. Note that the planar parts are shown in dark gray and two deformed regions share the same tangent plane to achieveG1continuity. Our technique can easily be applied to paper bending with non-convex curved boundary by subdividing it into a set of convex parts (see Fig. 11(a) and (b)).Our technique provides various ways of controlling the model of paper bending. We can place a cone or a cylinder on to the paper to be deformed in any position and orientation, and choose the aperture of a cone or the radius of a cylinder. However, it is not particularly intuitive to adjust these parameters. In this section we propose a direct manipulation technique in which a user selects an arbitrary pointp0on a model of a piece of paper and moves it to a new positionp1. The system then seeks a cone or cylinder which mapsp0top1.Direct manipulation using a cone: In general there will be several cones which mapp0top1. As shown in Fig. 5(a), let the planeπbe the perpendicular bisector of the line segmentp0p1¯, andlis the intersection line betweenπand the paper. Since all points onlare equidistant fromp0andp1, any cone with its apex onlwill perform the required mapping. We now introduce a coordinate systemx′y′z′, as shown in Fig. 5(a), and compute the coordinates ofp0=(x0,0,0)andp1=(x1,0,z1)inx′y′z′. Letxyzbe the coordinate system of a cone represented by a translationT(0,t,0)followed by a rotationRz(ϕ)ofx′y′z′(shown in blue in Fig. 5(b)). Inxyz, the two pointsp0andp1can be represented as follows:p0=(x0cosϕ−tsinϕ,−x0sinϕ−tcosϕ,0),p1=(x1cosϕ−tsinϕ,−x1sinϕ−tcosϕ,z1).We now find a cone which satisfies the following three constraints: (i) its apex is located at the origin ofxyz, (ii) it passes throughp1, and (iii) it is in contact withy-axis (see Fig. 5(b)). Letq=(0,a,b)be the center of the base of the cone andp2=(0,R,0)be the point at which the base circle contacts on thexy-plane, whereR=x12+t2+z12. The constraints give us the following identities:‖qp1⃗‖2=‖qp2⃗‖2,〈qp1⃗×qp2⃗,(1,0,0)〉=0,which results in the following linear system with two unknownsaandb:[R+x1sinϕ+tcosϕ−z1z1R+x1sinϕ+tcosϕ][ab]=[0z1R].By Cramer’s rule we can compute these unknowns as follows:(1)a=z12RD,b=z1R(R+x1sinϕ+tcosϕ)D,whereD=(R+x1sinϕ+tcosϕ)2+z12. Note that a different cone can be determined by each parameters(t,ϕ). Once we have found the cone using Eq. (1), we can compute the arc lengthsrβofp1p2̂andR(ϕ+δ)ofp0p2̂and adjusttandϕiteratively until these two arc lengths are identical. Thus our direct manipulation reduces to the problem of optimizing the following functional with the parameters(t,ϕ):(2)arg min(t,ϕ)|rβ−R(ϕ+δ)|.It is quite important to take initial guesses(t0,ϕ0)properly, because there exist many optimal parameters that locally minimize the objective function in Eq. (2). For this, we present a heuristic method based on the observation of real bent papers. Letd1(>0)andd2(<0)be the signed distances from the origin ofx′y′z′to the paper boundary in the direction ofy′-axis (see Fig. 6). If|d1+d2|<ϵfor a givenϵ≈0, the cone would be replaced with a cylinder, i.e. a cone with its apex at infinity (see Fig. 6(a)), otherwise the initial guesses(t0,ϕ0)can be chosen as follows:t0={d1+ks×d,if0≤d≤0.5−ϵ,d2−ks×(1−d),if0.5+ϵ≤d≤1,ϕ0=arctan(−x1/t0),whered=d1d1−d2andksis the stiffness of the paper for controlling its bending effects. These initial guesses reflect the behavior of real bent paper, and the optimal parameters(tˆ,ϕˆ)can efficiently be found by Powell’s method  [20].Fig. 6(a)–(c) show models of three bent sheets of paper generated by our technique, together with the cones determined by minimizing the objective function in Eq. (2). Our technique shows the similar results to real bent paper depending on the user’s displacements, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Moreover, the stiffnessksproduces different deformations of paper from the same user’s displacements, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c).Direct manipulation using a cylinder: Direct manipulation using a cylinder can be achieved by large stiffness (see Fig. 6(c)). However, we present a more efficient approach to this problem. Again we construct a coordinate systemx′y′z′, as shown in Fig. 7(a), and compute the coordinates ofp0=(x0,0,0)andp1=(0,0,z1)inx′y′z′. Nowxyz(blue in Fig. 7(b)) is the coordinate system of a cylinder represented by a translationT(t,0,0)ofx′y′z′. Inxyz, the two pointsp0andp1can be represented as follows:p0=(x0−t,0,0)andp1=(−t,0,z1).We now find a cylinder which is in contact withy-axis and passes throughp1. Letq=(0,0,r)be the center of the base of that cylinder, and letp2=(0,0,0)be the origin ofxyz. Since‖qp2⃗‖2=‖qp1⃗‖2and‖p1p2̂‖=‖p0p2¯‖, the following identities hold:r2=t2+(z1−r)2⇒r=12z1t2+z12,rβ=x0−t⇒β=x0−tr.Sincecosβ=〈op1⃗,op2⃗〉‖op1⃗‖‖op2⃗‖=1−z1/r, we can construct the following equation in terms of the unknownt:(3)cos(x0−trt)+z1rt−1=0,wherertis a function oft. Both the position and radius of the desired cylinder can be determined by finding the root of Eq. (3), which can be computed efficiently using Newton’s method with the initial guesst=0. Fig. 6(d) shows a model of a bent sheet of paper generated in this way, together with the cylinder constructed from the root of Eq. (3). Depending on the manipulation types, the same displacement generates different results in Fig. 6(b)–(d), respectively.Admissible user’s displacements: We assume that at least one corner-vertex of a planar figure remains in its initial position, which restricts user’s displacements for direct manipulation. More specifically, letdianddˆibe the distances from the corner-vertexvitop0and top1, respectively (see Fig. 8). Then,p1should be positioned so thatdˆi<difor at least onevi. If this fails, our system automatically movep1toward the nearest corner-vertex.
