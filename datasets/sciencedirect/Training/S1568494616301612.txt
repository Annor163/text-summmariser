@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The focus of this study is to use Monte Carlo method in fuzzy linear regression. The purpose of the study is to figure out the appropriate error measures for the estimation of fuzzy linear regression model parameters with Monte Carlo method. Since model parameters are estimated without any mathematical programming or heavy fuzzy arithmetic operations in fuzzy linear regression with Monte Carlo method. In the literature, only two error measures (E1 and E2) are available for the estimation of fuzzy linear regression model parameters. Additionally, accuracy of available error measures under the Monte Carlo procedure has not been evaluated. In this article, mean square error, mean percentage error, mean absolute percentage error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error are proposed for the estimation of fuzzy linear regression model parameters with Monte Carlo method. Moreover, estimation accuracies of existing and proposed error measures are explored. Error measures are compared to each other in terms of estimation accuracy; hence, this study demonstrates that the best error measures to estimate fuzzy linear regression model parameters with Monte Carlo method are proved to be E1, E2, and the mean square error. One the other hand, the worst one can be given as the mean percentage error. These results would be useful to enrich the studies that have already focused on fuzzy linear regression models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Regression analysis is a statistical tool that is used to figuring out the mathematical relation between two or more quantitative variables. In the literature, most of the available regression modelling approaches are rather restrictive and their applications to real life problems require various assumptions. Therefore, new techniques have been proposed to relax some of these assumptions. Fuzzy regression is one of these techniques that attracts more attention nowadays.After introduced by Tanaka et al. [1,2], the fuzzy regression analysis has become very popular with the introduction of fuzziness into regression. Many regression models including crisp input and fuzzy parameters, as well as fuzzy input and crisp parameters have been studied. Diamond [3] implemented regression models for crisp input and fuzzy output and fuzzy input-output. In these models, distance between fuzzy numbers was used to measure the goodness-of-fit for models. Furthermore, Näther and Körner [4] extended estimators of Tanaka et al. [1,2] with a least squares approach in the linear regression with crisp and fuzzy input and fuzzy output cases. Hong et al. [5] adopted a regression model with fuzzy input and fuzzy parameters. Additionally, Bardossy et al. [6] defined a new class of distance measures on fuzzy numbers and considered the regression model involving fuzzy input and fuzzy parameters. Peters [7], Luczynski and Matloka [8], Tanaka et al. [9], and Yen et al. [10] are some of the authors who focused on crisp input and fuzzy output regression models. D’Urso [11] carried out fuzzy linear regression analysis for fuzzy/crisp input and fuzzy/crisp output data. Moreover, Roh et al. [12] presented a new estimation approach based on Polynomial Neural Networks for fuzzy linear regression. Recently, a generalized maximum entropy estimation approach to fuzzy regression model is introduced by Ciavolinoa and Calcagni [13].Application areas of fuzzy linear regression analysis have been considerably improved by different approaches in recent years. For instance, the relationship between dimensions of health related quality of life and health conditions are investigated under fuzzy linear regression [14]. A new fuzzy linear regression approach for dissolved oxygen prediction is suggested by Khan and Valeo [15]. Fuzzy linear regression is also used in electricity demand forecasting by Sarkar et al. [16] and in global solar radiation prediction by Ramedani et al. [17]. Estimation of relationship between forest fires and meteorological conditions are investigated within the framework of fuzzy linear regression by Akdemir and Tiryaki [18].Abdalla and Buckley [19–21] are the first practitioners of Monte Carlo (MC) method within the fuzzy linear regression context. In the MC method, a number of regression coefficient vectors are randomly generated; then values of dependent variables are estimated by using each generated vector, and the vector that gives minimum value to an error measure is taken as the best estimate of regression parameters. Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] used two error measures and tackled problems that are defined on the positive side of the real line. However, they did not mention which definition of the absolute value of a fuzzy number is used in the calculations for the error measures.In this study, MC method for fuzzy linear regression analysis introduced by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] is taken as a focal point. The definition of AbuAarqob et al. [22] is used for the absolute value of a fuzzy number and the MC method is applied to the data set of Abdalla and Buckley [19,21]. Six error terms are used in this study. Two of them have already been used by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] and the other four different error measures that have not been previously calculated for MC method in fuzzy linear regression are used. These error measures are mean square error, mean percentage error, mean absolute percentage error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error. In order to evaluate estimation accuracy of the new and existing error measures in fuzzy linear regression modeling, an extended simulation study is conducted over the whole real line. In the design of simulation study, two cases that fuzzy input-fuzzy output and crisp input-fuzzy output are taken into consideration. The performance of four error measures along with those used by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] are evaluated and compared with each other. The best error measure and the one that should not be used for the estimation of fuzzy linear regression parameters are identified by MC method without using any mathematical programming or heavy fuzzy arithmetic operations.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: some preliminaries for fuzzy numbers, random crisp vectors, and random fuzzy vectors are presented in Section 2. Brief information about fuzzy linear regression models with MC method is given in Section 3.1. Error measures proposed for the MC method are given in Section 3.2. The simulation study that compares the performances of error measures is conducted in Section 4. After the decision of the best and the worst error measures in MC method for fuzzy linear regression models, values of the error measures are calculated for the real data sets used by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] in Section 5. Concluding remarks and some possible future perspectives are addressed Section 6.This section contains various definitions of fuzzy numbers and random fuzzy vectors that are defined by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21], Dubois and Prade [23], and AbuAarqob et al. [22].Definition 2.1A fuzzy numberA¯is a fuzzy subset of the real lineR. Its membership function μA(x) satisfies the following criteria [23]:•α-cut set of μA(x) is a closed interval,∃x such that μA(x)=1, andconvexity such thatμA(λx1+(1−λ)x2)≥min(μA(x1),μA(x2))forλ∈[0,1],Definition 2.2A triangular shaped fuzzy numberA¯is a fuzzy number whose membership function defined by three values, a1<a2<a3, where the base of triangular is the interval [a1, a3] and the vertex is x=a2[23].Definition 2.3The α-cut of a fuzzy numberA¯is a non-fuzzy set defined asA¯(α)={x∈R,μA(x)≥α}. HenceA¯(α)=[AL(α),AU(α)]whereAL(α)=inf{x∈R,μA(x)≥α}andAU(α)=sup{x∈R,μA(x)≥α}[23].Definition 2.4The absolute value of a fuzzy numberA¯∈RFis a functionF:RF→RFdenoted byF(A¯):=|A¯|with α-cutA¯(α). From the interval analysis [24], it is known that if I=[I−, I+], then |I|=[max(I−, −I+, 0), max(−I−, I+)]; and hence, the α-cut of|A¯|is given by(1)(|A¯|)α=[max(A¯−(α),−A¯+(α),0),max(−A¯−(α),A¯+(α))].From Eq. (1), the absolute value of a triangular fuzzy number is given as follows (for more information see [22,24]):(2)(|A¯|)α=A¯(α)ifA¯≥0−A¯(α)ifA¯≤0{0,max(−A¯−(α),A¯+(α))}ifx∈(A¯−(0),A¯+(0)).Definition 2.5Random crisp vectors are defined asvk=(v0k,…,vmk), elements of which are all real numbers in intervals Ii, i=0, 1, …, m. To obtain vk, firstly randomly crisp vectorsvk=(x1k,x2k,…,xmk)with all xikin [0, 1], k=1, 2, …, N are needed to be generated. Since each xikstarts out in [0,1], it is possible to put them into Ii=[ci, di] byvik=ci+(di−ci)xik, i=0, 1, …, m[19,25].Definition 2.6Random fuzzy vectors are defined asV¯k=(V¯0k,…,V¯mk),k=1, 2, …N, where eachV¯ikis a triangular fuzzy number. Firstly crisp vectorsvk=(x1k,…,x3m+3,k)with xik∈[0, 1], k=1, …, N are needed to be generated. Then first three numbers invkare chosen and ordered from smallest to largest. If it is assumed that x3k<x1k<x2k, the first triangular fuzzy number isV¯0k=(x3k/x1k/x2k). It is possible to continue with the next three numbers invkto formV¯ik, i=1, 2, …, m. In order to obtainV¯ikwithin certain intervals, it is supposed to be in interval Ii=[ai, bi], i=0, 1, 2, …, m. Since eachV¯ikstarts out in [0, 1], it is possible to put it into [ai, bi] by computing ai+(bi−ai)xik, i=1, 2, …, m (for more information see [21,25]).Fuzzy regression model is classified into three cases according to the type of independent and dependent variables by Choi and Buckley [26] as the following:(I)Input and output data are both crisp.Input data is crisp and output data is fuzzy.Input and output data are both fuzzy.The first category is considered as an ordinary regression model. Hence, Case-I is not taken into consideration in this paper. Fuzzy regression model for the second (Case-II) and third (Case-III) cases are considered.The fuzzy linear regression model for Case-II is given as follows:(3)Y¯l=A¯0+A¯1x1l+A¯2x2l+⋯+A¯mxmlwhere x1l, …, xmlfor l=1, …, n are crisp numbers andA¯0,…,A¯mandY¯lare all triangular fuzzy numbers. Given the data, the objective is to find a combination ofA¯j,j=1,…,mvalues that makes the overall difference between estimated and observed values of dependent variable (error) minimum. The fuzzy regression model for Case-III is given as follows:(4)Y¯l=a0+a1X¯1l+a2X¯2l+⋯+amX¯ml,whereX¯ilandY¯lfor i=1, …, m;l=1, …, n are triangular fuzzy numbers and aiis a crisp number. Here, the objective is to find a combination of aj, j=1, …, m values that makes the overall error minimum.Characterization of the above cases is developed from different perspectives; and hence, several conceptual and methodological approaches exist in fuzzy regression. It should also be mentioned that several cases are considered simultaneously to estimate fuzzy regression model parameters [27].In this section, brief information about the use of Monte Carlo method in fuzzy linear regression is given. Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] introduced the MC method for estimating fuzzy regression model parameters. Random fuzzy vectorsV¯k=(V¯0k,…,V¯mk)for Case-II or random crisp vectorsvk=(v0k,…,vmk)for Case-III are generated in this method.Arbitrary intervals which include model parameters are chosen for the generation of these vectors. Various optimization methods can be used to find an appropriate interval. Then, values of dependent variable are calculated over each candidate vector by using Eqs. (5) and (6) for Case-II and Case-III, respectively.(5)Y¯lk*=V¯0k+V¯1kx1l+⋯+V¯mkxml,(6)Y¯lk*=v0k+v1kX¯1l+⋯+vmkX¯ml.Accuracy of each candidateV¯kor vkvector depends on the used error measure. Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] use error measures E1 in Eq. (7) and E2 in Eq. (8) to quantify the error between the given (Y¯l) and the estimated (Y¯lk*) values for both Case-II and Case-III. The first error measure is(7)E1k=∑l=1n[∫−∞∞|Y¯l(x)−Y¯lk*(x)|dx]/[∫−∞∞Y¯l(x)dx],where the integrals are only calculated over interval(s) containing the support of the triangular fuzzy numbersY¯l=(yl1/yl2/yl3)andY¯lk*=(ylk1/ylk2/ylk3). The second error measure is(8)E2k=∑l=1n[|yl1−ylk1|+|yl2−ylk2|+|yl3−ylk3|].This process is repeated for N times, which is usually 104 or 105. For each case, two solution vectors that give minimum values for E1 and E2 are recorded and two best solutions for Case-II (or Case-III) are obtained. The first one is the vectorV¯k(or vk) that corresponds to minimum E1kand the second is the one that gives the minimum E2kover all k vectors. If several candidate intervals are chosen, the calculations described above are done for each interval. Best solutions obtained for each interval are used as the most accurate parameter estimates of fuzzy linear regression models.In the literature, E1 and E2 (given in Section 3.1) are the only error measures that are used for obtaining best parameter estimates of fuzzy linear regression models with the MC method. Moreover, there is not any available approach proposed for the comparison of the values of E1 and E2 with each other in order to choose a unique best solution for the fuzzy linear regression models.The main contribution of this study is the application of new error measures in fuzzy linear regression with the MC method. Within this context, mean square error (MSEe), mean percentage error (MPEe), mean absolute percentage error (MAPEe) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPEe) are all proposed as the error measures. Furthermore, estimation accuracy of the error measures used by Abdalla and Buckley [19,21] and the proposed error measures are evaluated and compared under a simulation study. In so doing, the aim is to determine the best error measure in order to achieve the best parameter estimate for the fuzzy linear regression models with the MC method.The error measures proposed for fuzzy linear regression with Monte Carlo method are explained as follows:•MSEedescribes the average squared difference between estimated and the corresponding true value and is given as(9)MSEe=1n∑i=1n[(yl1−ylk1)2+(yl2−ylk2)2+(yl3−ylk3)2].MPEeis computed as average of percentage errors between predicted and the corresponding true value and is given as(10)MPEe=1n∑i=1nylk1−yl1yl1+ylk2−yl2yl2+ylk3−yl3yl3.MAPEeexpresses the accuracy as a percentage and is defined by(11)MAPEe=100n∑i=1n|ylk1−yl1yl1|+|ylk2−yl2yl2|+|ylk3−yl3yl3|.SMAPEeis an accuracy measure based on percentage errors and is given as(12)SMAPEe=1n∑i=1n|ylk1−yl1|(ylk1−yl1)/2+|ylk2−yl2|(ylk2−yl2)/2+|ylk3−yl3|(ylk3−yl3)/2.A simulation study is conducted by taking into account of the error measures E1 and E2, and those given from Eqs. (9)–(12).In this section, estimation accuracy of the error measures mentioned in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 is evaluated within the simulation study. In our simulations, generation of random data for dependent and independent variables for Case-II and Case-III is described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively.Simulation scenarios depend on the intervals, which are used for generating candidate solution vectors in the MC method given in Table 1. Both sides of the real line and interval widths are considered in the determination of these intervals.In Table 1, I0 is a short interval excluding negative numbers, I1 is a short interval including negative numbers, I2 is a long interval excluding negative numbers, I3 is a long interval including both negative and positive numbers, I4 is a short interval excluding positive numbers, and I5 is a long interval including only negative numbers.The intervals I0 to I5 are used for estimating regression parametersA¯0,A¯1,A¯2, andA¯3for Case-II. Then, the same intervals are used for estimating regression parameters a0, a1, and a2 for Case-III. In each scenario, 105 candidate solution vectors are generated.Parameter estimates of fuzzy linear regression models are obtained by using the MC method for both Case-II and Case-III for each interval given in Table 1 for 103 times.We need to have an approach for comparing the estimation accuracy of used error measures. Although error measures acquired from different approaches are not comparable, deviations between estimated and observed values of dependent variable obtained by using different error measures are comparable. In both Case-II and Case-III, dependent variable is a fuzzy number. The value of a deviation measure can be calculated as a fuzzy or crisp number. If it is calculated as a fuzzy number, there are several approaches for comparing sizes of fuzzy numbers. However, we can separately compare left, center, and right values of estimated and observed values of dependent variable, calculate deviation for each of them, and obtain average deviation of left, center, and right values. This is a hybrid of fuzzyness and crispness. On this point, mean absolute error (MAEc) and mean square error (MSEc) measures are used as a measure of the deviation. These measures will be called as “comparison measures (c)” hereafter and are given in Eqs. (13) and (14):(13)MAEc=13∑j=13|ylj−ylkj|,(14)MSEc=13∑j=13(ylj−ylkj)2.In each of 103 replications, data sets of size 12 are randomly generated from Normal (0, 4) distribution for the first (x1), second (x2), and third (x3) independent variables. Fuzzy numbers for the values of each parameter are randomly generated from normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.02 forA¯0, from normal distribution with mean 2 and standard deviation 0.02 forA¯1, from normal distribution with mean −1 and standard deviation 0.04 forA¯2, and from normal distribution with mean −2 and standard deviation 0.1 forA¯3. The corresponding values of dependent variable are obtained under the model given in Eq. (3).Each scenario given in Table 1 is applied for the simulation study, 105 vectors are generated, and the described MC method is applied in order to obtain estimates of parameters of the fuzzy linear regression model. Based on the minimum errors, the accuracy between estimated and true values of regression parameters is evaluated by using both MAEcand MSEc.Tables 2 and 3present simulation results of Case-II for the error measure MAEc.Based on Tables 2 and 3, the worst and the best cases for each interval are presented below:•The same error values for the left, center, and right sides of each fuzzy parameter are obtained by considering error measures E1 and E2 for each interval.According to interval I0, minimum error values are given by MAPEe, SMAPEe, and MSEeforA¯0andA¯2,A¯1, andA¯3, respectively. On the other hand, maximum error values are observed with MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I1, the minimum error value is observed with MSEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I2, the minimum error value is produced by MSEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 2, 3 and by MAPEeforA¯1. However, maximum error values are obtained with SMAPEeforA¯0,A¯1and with MPEeforA¯2andA¯3.According to interval I3, the minimum error value is observed with SMAPEeforA¯0and with E1 and E2 forA¯1, and with SMAPEeand MSEeforA¯2andA¯3, respectively. On the other hand, maximum error values are observed with MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I4, the minimum error value is obtained with MSEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2 and with SMAPE forA¯3. However, maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 3 and with SMAPEeforA¯2.According to interval I5, minimum error values are observed with E1 and E2 forA¯0, with MAPEeforA¯1, and with MSEeforA¯2andA¯3. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEeforA¯0,A¯1and with SMAPEeobserved forA¯2andA¯3.Simulation results of Case-II for the error measure MSEcare given in Tables 4 and 5.Based on Tables 4 and 5, the worst and the best cases for each interval are presented below:•The same error values are obtained for the left, center, and right sides of each fuzzy parameter with considering error measures E1 and E2 for each interval.According to interval I0, the minimum error value is obtained with MAPEeforA¯0andA¯2, with SMAPEeand MSEeforA¯1andA¯3, respectively. On the other hand, maximum error values are obtained by MPEeforA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I1, the minimum error value is observed with MSEeforA¯i, i=0, 2, 3 and with E1 and E2 forA¯1. However, maximum error values are observed by MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I2, the minimum error value is seen with MSEeforA¯i, i=0, 2, 3 and with MAPEeforA¯1. On the other hand, maximum error values are obtained by SMAPEeforA¯0andA¯1and by MPEeforA¯2andA¯3.According to interval I3, the minimum error value is observed with SMAPE forA¯0, with E1 and E2 forA¯1andA¯2, respectively, and with MSEeforA¯3. Maximum values are obtained by MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I4, the minimum error value is seen with MSEeforA¯0,A¯1, andA¯2, with SMAPEeforA¯3. However, maximum values are obtained by MPEefor eachA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3.According to interval I5, the minimum error value is obtained with E1 and E2 forA¯0andA¯1, respectively, and with MSEeforA¯2andA¯3. However, maximum values are obtained with MPEeforA¯0,A¯1and with SMAPEeforA¯2andA¯3.In each of 103 replications, 10 triangular fuzzy numbers that have normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 2 are randomly generated for each independent variable (X¯1,X¯2). Also three crisp numbers for each parameter are randomly generated from normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.02 for a0, from normal distribution with mean 2 and standard deviation 0.02 for a1, and from normal distribution with mean -1 and standard deviation 0.04 for a2. The corresponding values of dependent variable are obtained under the model given in Eq. (4).Each scenario given in Table 1 is applied for the simulation study, 105 vectors are generated, and the described MC method is applied in order to obtain estimates of parameters in the fuzzy linear regression model. Afterwards, taking minimum errors into consideration, the accuracy between estimated and true values of regression parameters is evaluated by using MAEcand MSEc. Since our parameters are crisp numbers, left, center, and right values are taken into account as aifor i=0, 1, 2.Table 6gives simulation results of Case-III for the error measure MAEc.The following inferences are drawn from Table 6:•The same error values are observed for each parameter by considering error measures E1 and E2 for each interval.According to interval I0, the minimum error value is generated by MSEefor a0 and by E1 and E2 for a1 and a2, respectively. On the other hand, maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each ai0, 1, 2.According to interval I1, the minimum error value is obtained with MSEefor a0 and with MAPEefor a1 and a2. However, maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2.According to interval I2, the minimum error value is produced by MSEefor a0 and a1, and by MAPEefor a2. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a2 and with SMAPEefor a1.According to interval I3, the minimum value is obtained with MSEefor a0, with E1 and E2 for a1, and with MAPEefor a2. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2.According to interval I4, the minimum error value is given by MSEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2 and maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a1 and with SMAPEefor a2.According to interval I5, the minimum error value is obtained with MSEefor a0, with E1 and E2 for a1, and with MSEefor a2. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a1 and with SMAPEefor a2.Table 7presents simulation results of Case-III for the error measure MSEc.The following inferences are drawn from Table 7:•The same error values are obtained for each parameter by considering error measures E1 and E2 for each interval.According to interval I0, minimum error values are generated by MSEe, SMAPEe, and MSEefor a0, a1, and a2, respectively. On the other hand, maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each a0, a1, and a2.According to interval I1, minimum error values are obtained with MSEe, SMAPEe, and MSEefor a0, a1, and a2, respectively. However, maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2.According to interval I2, the minimum error value is given by MSEefor a0 and a1, and by E1 and E2 for a2. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a2 and with SMAPEefor a1.According to interval I3, the minimum error value is obtained with MSEefor a0 and a2 and with E1 and E2 for a1. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2.According to interval I4, the minimum error value is observed with MSEefor each ai, i=0, 1, 2. Maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a1 and with SMAPEefor a2.According to interval I5, the minimum error value is obtained with MSE for each ai, i=0, 1, 2, and maximum error values are obtained with MPEefor a0 and a1 and with SMAPEefor a2.Considering the simulation results, minimum error values are produced by the error measures E1, E2, and MSEeand nearly all maximum error values are observed with the error measure MPEefor both MAEcand MSEcin both Case-II and Case-III. Hence, it is possible to conclude that the best error measures to estimate fuzy/crisp parameters of fuzzy linear regression models are not only E1 and E2 but also usage of MSEegives precise results. Furthermore, the worst error measure is proved to be MPEefor estimating the parameters of fuzzy linear regression models with MC method.This section contains two applications of fuzzy linear regression models to Case-II and Case-III. We apply the MC method to estimate regression parameters and calculate error measures E1, E2, MSEe, and MPEe. The reason behind the selection of these error measures is because the best estimates are obtained with E1, E2, and MSEe, whereas the worst estimates are calculated by MPEe, as demonstrated in the simulation study.The popular data set analysed by several authors including Abdalla and Buckley [21] in the literature is revisited for this application. It contains the cognitive response times of the control room crew in a nuclear power plant to an unusual event as the dependent variable. Three independent variables which are inside control room experience, outside control room experience, and education are shown by x1, x2, and x3, respectively. The dependent and independent variables are recorded for eight (n=8) teams in the data set (complete data set can be seen in Kim and Bishu [28]).First, the intervals Ii, i=0, 1, 2, 3 should be obtained to findA¯icoefficients as explained in Definition 2.6. The solutions for Ii, i=0, 1, 2, 3 are taken from Abdalla and Buckley [21] as the results of our approach should be comparable with the previous approaches. They study under four separate intervals for eachA¯i, as outlined in Table 8.Using the data set in Kim and Bishu [28] with n=8 and N=105,vk=(v1k,v2k,…,v12k)vectors, which define theA¯i, i=0, 1, 2, 3 as described in Section 2, are generated. Table 9demonstrates the values ofA¯ithat give minimum values to E1, E2, MSEeand MPEeunder each Iisetting.The solutions for theA¯iare obtained and predicted values are determined. Abdalla and Buckley [21] give optimal solutions forA¯iasA¯0=(−0.710/−0.539/−0.524),A¯1=(−0.610/−0.473/−0.472),A¯2=(−1.090/−1.089/−1.088), andA¯3=(0.459/0.487/0.68). The values of error measures E1, E2, MSEe, and MPEeare computed by using Eqs. (7)–(10). The results are shown in Table 10, where the results of previous studies are given under the relevant citation and our results are given under “MC” column.Values of error measures obtained by our algorithm are considerably smaller than the results of Savic and Peryzc [29], Tanaka [30], and Kim and Bishu [28], better than those of Abdalla and Buckley [21] for MCIII and MCVI for E1, and nearly same for E2. Abdalla and Buckley [21] achieved the smallest error value under MCII. On the other hand, we get the smallest error value under MCII with MSEe. In addition to the error measures E1 and E2, other error measures are also calculated for this application. According to the simulation results, it is obtained that MPEecannot be used because it gives negative error values.The data set used for this application was also studied by Choi and Buckley [26], Diamond and Körner [31], and Abdalla and Buckley [19]. The data set consists of two independent variables which are shown byX¯1andX¯2and 10 observations. The intervals Ii, i=0, 1, 2, 3 should be calculated to obtain aifor i=0, 1, 2 as explained in Definition 2.5. The solutions for Ii, i=0, 1, 2 are taken from Abdalla and Buckley [19]. They study under four separate intervals for Ii, which are given in Table 11.Table 12demonstrates the values of aithat give minimum values to E1, E2, MSEe, and MPEeunder each Iisetting.The optimal solutions for aiare given as a0=4.19, a1=4.97, and a2=3.11 by Abdalla and Buckley [19]. Regarding the obtained estimates according to each error measure and each interval, closest values to the true values are obtained according to MCI with E2.After the calculation of error measures E1, E2, MSEe, and MPEe, the obtained results are shown in Table 13, where the results of previous studies are given under the relevant citation.In Table 13, our results are very close to those obtained by Abdalla and Buckley [19], however our method does not provide the smallest error measures for each interval for E1. Our algorithm gives the smallest E2 value under each interval whereas algorithm of Abdalla and Buckley [19] produces the smallest E1 value under each interval.

In this study, we use different error measures to find parameter estimates of fuzzy linear regression models with MC method. Regression models are applied to two cases. In the first one, input data is crisp and output data is fuzzy (Case-II) and in the second case, input and output data are both fuzzy (Case-III). We utilize a more general definition of absolute value of a triangular shaped fuzzy number given by AbuAraqub et al. [22] in our MC method.A simulation study is conducted to compare estimation performances of the selected error measures. It is demonstrated that only two error measures (E1 and E2) are not sufficient to estimate parameters of fuzzy linear regression models. Additionally, parameter estimates that make each error measure minimum are calculated. The differences between the true and estimated values of the parameters are evaluated by using MAEcand MSEc. These error measures are preferred because of the fact that MSEcat least has two advantages over other distance measures: First, it is analytically tractable and second, it has an interpretation. Besides, MAEcis a reasonable alternative of MSEc. Also, the parameters are estimated by considering five different intervals that possibly include their true values. Each interval (Ii, i=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) is arbitrarily determined according to its length and status of involving any negative number.The results of simulation study are generalized as follows. Considering Case-II, minimum error values are observed in E1, E2, and MSEe. On the other hand, maximum errors are often produced by MPEeregarding both MAEcand MSEc. Considering Case-III, minimum error values are obtained by E1, E2, and MSEe. However, maximum errors are often observed by MPEein terms of both MAEcand MSEc. As a result, it is possible to conclude that best error measures to estimate fuzzy/crisp parameters of fuzzy linear regression models are not only E1 and E2 but also MSEe. Furthermore, the worst error measure is proved to be MPEefor estimating the parameters of fuzzy linear regression models.After obtaining simulation results, the performance of proposed MC method is compared with other MC studies from the literature according to previously studied data sets. In the application for Case-II, the smallest error measure is obtained with E1 in the previous studies [28–30] and Buckley and Abdalla's study [21] under MCIII and MCIV settings. Furthermore, the smallest error measure is observed with E2 in the previous studies [28–30] and it is very close to the values of the previous study of Buckley and Abdalla [21] under each interval. From the overall results of Case-II, the minimum error measure is obtained by MPEe. However, it can be seen that this error measure is unsuitable to be used for the parameter estimation of fuzzy linear regression model with the simulation study. The maximum error measure is observed with E2 under MCIV setting. In the application for Case-III, the smallest error measure is observed with E2 in the previous studies [31,26,19] for each interval. The smallest error measure is seen with E1 in the previous studies [31,26] and it is very close to the values of [19] for each interval. When we look at the overall results of Case-III, the minimum error measure is obtained with MPEewhich is unsuitable to use for fuzzy linear regression model and maximum error measure is observed with E2 under MCIV setting. Finally, it is concluded that the best error measures for fuzzy linear regression with MC method are E1, E2, and MSEe. Nevertheless, MPEeis the worst one for estimating the fuzzy/crisp parameters of fuzzy linear regression models by MC method.Obtained results can and will be used to enrich the studies that have already focused on fuzzy linear regression models. For example, investigation on the spreads of estimated fuzzy dependent variables in fuzzy linear regression model [32] can be enhanced by the help of fuzzy linear regression with MC methods according to the best error measures determined in this study. Moreover, Multi-Level fuzzy linear regression model parameters studied by Kazemi et al. [33] can be estimated with the MC method using the error measure MSE. Taking into consideration of the best error measures determined in this study, fuzzy linear regression model with MC method can facilitate the fuzzy applications in renewable energy systems [34] such as solar, wind, or space heating due to its ease of applicability. Benchmarking process with fuzzy linear regression model [35] can be regenerated with MC method based on the suitable error measures determined in this study. Outlier detection in the view of linguistic variable [36] is also a potential study area of fuzzy linear regression with Monte Carlo method within the framework of the error measures determined in this study.It is observed that common error measures such as MAEcand MSEccan be successfully used to assess accuracy of parameter estimates of fuzzy regression models. Consequently, another future study can and will focus on the problem that occurs in the assessment of the quality of the fuzzy regression models by using these error measures.Considering other possible ways to get the absolute value of the triangular fuzzy number, it is possible to apply different methods in MC method in fuzzy linear regression analysis. Therefore, future research may be conducted to apply different definitions of absolute value of triangular fuzzy numbers. Extension of the proposed method for different types of fuzzy regression models, such as nonparametric fuzzy regression or fuzzy nonlinear regression, is, also, a potential area for the future works.
