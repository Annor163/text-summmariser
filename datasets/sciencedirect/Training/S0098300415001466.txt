Spring indices can be used to characterize spring onset across a wide range of spatial scales.These indices are based on phenological models, but can be computed from meteorological data.We present software and documentation for calculating spring indices.Some basic examples of the potential uses and extensions of the spring indices are also shown.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Understanding the impacts of global climate change on ecosystems requires systematic development and use of metrics to track seasonal transitions clearly and consistently across broad spatial scales and through time. Phenology – the study of seasonally recurrent biological events and their relation to climate – can help to guide the development of such metrics because many phenological events are sensitive to variations of weather and climate (Lieth, 1974). Accordingly, worldwide efforts to collect, monitor, and synthesize phenological data offer a unique perspective on how global climate change is affecting organisms across a wide range of spatial scales (Vliet et al., 2003; IPCC, 2007; Janetos et al., 2012; Schwartz et al., 2012). Although in the past phenological observations were collected by individual observers at relatively small scales, developments in information and communication technologies are presenting new opportunities for overcoming these historical limitations. Today phenological data collection is “crowd-sourced” to the general public (Vliet et al., 2003; Schwartz et al., 2012), and observed from space (e.g., White et al., 2009; Zurita-Milla et al., 2013). As these networks of volunteers and remote sensing operations grow in scale and scope, interpretation of the sheer volume of data will be greatly improved if it can be readily compared with clearly defined markers of seasonal evolution.The spring indices (SI) “suite of metrics” (Schwartz et al., 2006) are a prominent example of phenological indices that have been widely used to characterize the transition from winter into spring in a clear and consistent way across continental scales and through time. These metrics include indices of “first leaf” and “first bloom,” as well as “last freeze” and the “damage index,” which records the anomalous amount of time from the appearance of foliage to the last freeze (e.g., Schwartz and Marotz, 1986, 1988; Schwartz, 1999; Schwartz and Reiter, 2000; Schwartz et al., 2006, 2013). Here, we present aMATLAB©toolbox called ml_si that calculates the most recent version of SI, which were originally developed by M.D. Schwartz almost 25 years ago. This toolbox consists of six core functions to calculate spring indices from daily values of temperature minima (Tmin) and maxima (Tmax) from any arbitrary location in the Northern Hemisphere. The toolbox is distributed as a single zipped tarball through the “MATLAB©Central” file exchange (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/), and also as Supplementary material to this document. It will be updated periodically as new versions are released to extend its functionality.In the 1950s Joe Caprio of Montana State University initiated a program to monitor the phenological responses of Lilac (Syringa vulgaris) with the aid of a large network of volunteers (e.g., Schwartz and Reiter, 2000; Cayan et al., 2001; Schwartz et al., 2012). At its peak, the network consisted of several hundred citizen scientists making observations across 12 western states. The project lasted more than 40 years, and even today, certain elements of these early efforts continue to be supported by the USA National Phenological Network (USA-NPN: http://www.usanpn.org/), which also coordinates large scale monitoring projects of a much wider diversity of plant and animal species (Schwartz et al., 2012).Similar observations to those in the Caprio network were also made in the Eastern US, and this continental-scale coverage of phenological data over several decades allowed Schwartz (1985) to develop models of Lilac (Syringa) and Honeysuckle (Lonicera) phenology using observed meteorological variables (minimum and maximum temperatures, in this case). These models were optimized for use at continental-scales, meaning that they reliably indicate the same event (e.g., first leaf) whether they are calculated from meteorological data in Arizona or British Columbia. Such consistency has allowed for the spring indices to be used for a variety of applications, including characterizing the impacts of global change (Schwartz et al., 2006), interpreting satellite observations of land-surface phenology (White et al., 2009), and understanding interannual variations in spring onset and its impacts (Ault et al., 2011; McCabe et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2013; Ault et al., 2013; Peterson and Abatzoglou, 2014).Translating daily temperature fluctuations into indices of spring onset is motivated by two features of this seasonal transition. First, variations in the timing of many phenological events vary considerably on interannual timescales, meaning that the day of year when spring foliage first appears on a given plant typically differs from one year to the next. Second, the start of the growing season for many species occurs coherently across large spatial scales. Taken together, these two attributes of spring onset motivate a climate-oriented (as opposed to plant-oriented) approach to characterizing spring onset: interannual variations by themselves could be explained by assuming that the timing of plant events is stochastic, while large-scale correlations could arise from deterministic elements of the environment (e.g., the length of the day). From a climatic perspective, however, these two features are interpreted as the hallmark of weather variations on interannual timescales, which are themselves correlated across large spatial scales. This “climate-centric” perspective on spring onset is the starting point for the spring indices.To translate meteorological data (Tminand Tmax) into indices that track the timing of spring in a consistent way through time and across large spatial scales, the calculation of the SI makes the following assumptions, which are valid for most temperate regions:1.Phenological observations from a few key indicator species can be used to characterize spring onset in a way that is relevant to a wide range of ecological and climatic transitions at the start of spring.Where moisture availability is not a factor, plant phenological responses reflect the accumulated effects of temperature fluctuations in conjunction with increasing day length.Near surface temperatures in temperate regions do not increase monotonically during springtime, but instead fluctuate as a consequence of large-scale (e.g.,∽1000km) physical processes. These phenomena are typically synoptic-scale weather patterns that drive multi-day warm episodes by advecting warm air masses in from the south.Synoptic-scale weather events can be detected from meteorological observations of daily Tminand Tmax.
