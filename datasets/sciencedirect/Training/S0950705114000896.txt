@&#ABSTRACT@&#
One of the key issues of knowledge discovery and data mining is knowledge reduction. Attribute reduction of formal contexts based on the granules and dominance relation are first reviewed in this paper. Relations between granular reduts and dominance reducts are investigated with the aim to establish a bridge between the two reduction approaches. We obtain meaningful results showing that granule-based and dominance-relation-based attribute reducts and attribute characteristics are identical. Utilizing dominance reducts and attribute characteristics, we can obtain all granular reducts and attribute characteristics by the proposed approach. In addition, we establish relations between dominance classes and irreducible elements, and present some judgment theorems with respect to the irreducible elements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The theory of formal concept analysis (FCA) proposed by Wille [13,54] has been formalized into an efficient methodology for data analysis and knowledge processing. FCA has become an important and appealing theoretical undertaking in recent years. It has been applied to various domains such as data mining, information retrieval, knowledge acquisition, software engineering, and database management systems [1–4,6,10,12,15,20,23–25,28,29,47,59,63,64].Attribute reduction is an important issue in the discovery of knowledge in information systems. In terms of formal contexts, attribute reduction is the search for a minimal attribute subset that preserves required concepts and their hierarchical structure by deleting irrelevant attributes from the database. Rapid growth of interest in attribute reduction in FCA is evidenced in recent years [9,11,27,37–41,52,57,66].The theory of rough set (RS), proposed by Pawlak [44], is an extension of the classical set theory. RS is a tool useful for dealing with imprecision, vagueness and uncertainty of information. The original rough set theory does not consider attributes with preference-ordered domains. However, in reality, one often faces the ordering problems of objects. For this reason, Greco et al. [16–18] proposed a dominance-based rough sets approach (DRSA) to take into account the ordering properties of attributes and gave a general frame work. Greco et al. [19] presented a general model of rough approximations based on ordinal properties of membership functions of fuzzy sets, in which the classical rough set theory can be considered as a particular case.Attribute reduction is a major topic in rough set research. An attribute reduct is a minimum subset of attributes that preserves required property of a given information system obtained under the entire set of attributes by eliminating attributes that are not essential for the classification of objects or decision rules. Based on different binary relation and different requirements, a large variety of models and approaches to knowledge reduction have been proposed in the last two decades, see for examples [7,21,26,35,42,32–34,48,56,58,65].Both FCA and RS are analyzed based on binary information tables. Both deal with the problems of knowledge discovery and knowledge representation. Therefore, the relations between FCA and RS is an interesting research direction. This paper focuses on attribute reduts of FCA and RS, and investigate the relations between FCA reduts and RS reducts in a formal context. The meaningful results have been obtained.The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the related work is recalled. In Section 3, we first review some basic notions of formal concept analysis. We then briefly recall the definitions of granular reduction and the corresponding reduction theory in Wu et al. [57] that serves as a basis for subsequent analysis. In Section 4, we introduce dominance relation into formal contexts and discuss the relations between dominance class and the irreducible element. Based on dominance relation, attribute reduction and attribute characteristics of formal contexts is proposed in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss approaches to attribute reduction in consistent formal decision contexts. We demonstrate applications of the proposed method in Section 7. We then conclude the paper with a summary and directions for future research in Section 8.
