BackgroundThe study of biomechanics of deformation and fracture of hard biological tissues involving organic matrix remains a challenge as variations in mechanical properties and fracture mode may have time-dependency. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely used but the shortcomings of FEA such as the long computation time owing to re-meshing in simulating fracture mechanics have warranted the development of alternative computational methods with higher throughput. The aim of this study was to compare dynamic two-dimensional FEA and moving particle simulation (MPS) when assuming a plane strain condition in the modeling of human enamel on a reduced scale.MethodsTwo-dimensional models with the same geometry were developed for MPS and FEA and tested in tension generated with a single step of displacement. The displacement, velocity, pressure, and stress levels were compared and Spearman׳s rank-correlation coefficients R were calculated (p<0.001).ResultsThe MPS and FEA were significantly correlated for displacement, velocity, pressure, and Y-stress.ConclusionsThe MPS may be further developed as an alternative approach without mesh generation to simulate deformation and fracture phenomena of dental and potentially other hard tissues with complex microstructure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Understanding the biomechanics of deformation and fracture of biological tissues is crucial in not only elucidating tissue damage caused by external forces but also in developing novel biomaterials for tissue substitution. Native biological tissues have a variety of mechanical properties even within a single tissue [1], because the cell and matrix distributions are different within the tissue and each has time-dependent property variation. Therefore, the precise measurement of the deformation and complex fracture patterns of biological tissues remains a major challenge [2]. Finite element analysis (FEA) [3,4] is considered an important tool with which to elucidate the biomechanics of such deformation [5] and fracture [6].While FEA has been widely used in dentistry to simulate different treatment modalities that are dental or implant supported, the mechanical simulation of dental tissue deformation and fracture has received notably less attention. One of the reasons for such a lack of data in the literature is the challenge of properly modeling the complex structure of enamel and dentin microstructures [7,8], the dentin–enamel-junction [9], and the hybrid layer [10]. Among them, enamel is an especially-important target for the elucidation of the biomechanics of fracture because of its complex deformation patterns and principal modes of tooth failures, which include radial/median cracking and channel-like margin cracking [11]. Enamel has a complex microstructure involving organic matter surrounded by a tufts-like structure and both viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior to make wear resistance, anti-fatigue, and crack resistant abilities [12].The usual assumption of small deformation commonly made for FEA software meshes results in a geometric limitation when attempting to evaluate large deformation and fracture. Especially in the simulation of crack propagation, mesh elimination techniques of Lagrangian based FEA, which generate complex boundary conditions, are used. Thus, to predict fracture phenomena precisely, a finite element model must be presented on a number of meshes throughout time, further increasing the time required for simulation. In general, when modeling intricate functionally graded complex geometries such as those of enamel and dentin, the approximation error is reduced by refining the mesh. Computations thus need to be made for multiple mesh iteration in systems undergoing deformations. The development of new approaches of simulating dental tissues would be beneficial to researchers and ultimately clinicians and patients as an improvement in the mechanical simulation of such tissues would allow a more robust informed design platform for the development of novel biomaterials and treatment modalities.Moving particle simulation (MPS) is a computational method of simulating the fragmentation of incompressible free surface flows originally used in nuclear engineering [13]. Recently, the MPS has been extended to the non-linear elastodynamics of compressible and incompressible materials such as viscosity in enamel [14]. When compared with FEA, MPS has the distinct advantage of being a mesh free model, which is more suited to deformation analysis and to simulation of complex material properties such as interprismatic organic matrix of enamel [15]. A current limitations of the MPS method is that to date there have been no systematic comparative studies with FEA.The aim of this study was to perform dynamic two-dimensional FEA and MPS microscale modeling of human enamel in a single layer assuming a plane strain condition as a basic evaluation. Two-dimensional models with the same geometry were developed for both MPS and FEA and the models were tested in tension. The displacement, velocity, pressure, and stress levels were compared between the two simulation methods.In MPS [13], the constitutive equation in terms of velocity for an elastic body ναis follows:(1)ρ∂vα∂t=∂∂xβ[λεγγδαβ+2μεαβ]where ρ, εγγand δαβare the density, volumetric strain, and Kronecker delta, respectively.α,β, andγare the axis directions. x is the position of a particle. λ and μ are Lame constants and related to Young׳s modulus E and Poisson׳s ratio υ, which are defined by the following equations:(2)λ=Eυ(1+υ)(1−2υ)(3)μ=E2(1+υ)In MPS, the partial differential equation is discretized using a model of interaction between particles. The interaction model takes the form of a weight function W:(4)W(rij)={rerij−1(rij≤re)0(rij>re)whererijis the distance vector between particles i and j and reis the affected radius of particle i. The initial relative position vectorrij0and relative position vector during calculationrijbetween particle i and j are defined as(5)rij0=xj0−xi0(6)rij=xj−xiwherexj0andxi0andxjandxiare an initial and current position vectors for particles j and i, respectively. Letrθbe a rotated vector such thatrij0was rotated through an angle θij:(7)rθ=Tij⋅rij0.Here, Tijand θijare defined by(8)Tij=[cosθij−sinijsinijcosθij],(9)θij=θi−θj2.By subtractingrθfromrij, the relative displacement vector due to strainuijεis obtained as(10)uijε=rij−rθ.This relative displacement vector is divided into normal and tangential directions:(11)(uijε)n=(uijε⋅rij)rij|rij2|,(12)(uijε)s=uijε−(uijε)n.Normal and tangential components of the tensor of strain between particles i and j are(13)(εn)ij=(uijε)n|rij0|,(14)(εs)ij=(uijε)s|rij0|.Finally, normal and shear stressσijandτ;ijare calculated as(15)σij=2μ(εn)ij=2μ(uijε)n|rij0|,(16)τij=2μ(εs)ij=2μ(uijε)s|rij0|.A two-dimensional finite element model were constructed for human enamel by assuming plane strain conditions as shown inFig. 1. The two models had identical model geometry, boundary conditions, material properties. The time scale was also identical between models. The numbers of nodes (FEA) and particles (MPS) were 462 (11×42). The nodes and particles were regularly spaced at intervals of 3µm. The nodes and particles in a 11×3 configuration in the upper and lower aspects of the model were set as rigid bodies while the middle part was set as a linear elastic body with the mechanical properties of enamel (Young׳s modulus: 84.1GPa, Poisson׳s ratio of 0.3 [16], and density of 3000kg/m3[17]). By following the compression loading on the macroscale, the lower rigid body was completely fixed and the upper rigid body was tensioned in the y-direction by applying a displacement of 0.76µm in one step. Rigid bodies of upper and lower parts was adopted to maintain a numerical stability. The total simulation time was adjusted to 3.0e–6s, which was sufficient time to observe single stress propagation from the top to the bottom of the model. Both FEA and MPS were performed as dynamic analysis with time dependency.To evaluate the difference between FEA and MPS, the displacement, velocity, pressure, and Y-stress (stress along the Y-axis,Fig. 2) output were observed from step 0 to 3000 in intervals of 600 steps. For the displacement and velocity, nodes 35 and 238; and particles 407 and 214 were selected as observation points (Fig. 2A), respectively. For the pressure and Y-stress, elements 21 and 184; and particle 407 and the average of particle 202, 203, 213, and 214 were selected as observation areas (Fig. 2B). Then, maximum differences for each parameter along the entire simulation time frame were then determined and Spearman׳s coefficient R for rank correlation between MPS and FEA was calculated (p<0.001) using SPSS Statistics 18 (IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). For each parameter evaluated at different regions of the specimen. FEA was performed by LS-DYNA (LSTC, Livermore, CA, USA) and MPS was originally implemented using C++ language in Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition (Microsoft, Minato-ku, Japan). FEA and MPS software ran on a single custom-made workstation (Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 64bit OS, 24GB RAM, Intel(R) Xeon(R) W5590 3.33GHz CPU) to avoid workstation variability and the calculation cost (run time, CPU usage, and working memory usage) was recorded. Finally, the Y-stress distribution plots and measured velocities of stress propagation from displacement of 0.099mm between elements 22 and 55; and particles 407 and 33 were obtained.
