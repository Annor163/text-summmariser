@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of positive and negative affective states on comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials. The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) was used to manipulate the affective states of sixty male undergraduate and graduate student participants. We used sixteen standard industrial warning pictorials, which were representative of a variety of industries, to assess changes in comprehension and hazard perception. Participants in the positive affect condition perceived greater hazards from the warning signs than those in the neutral affect condition or the negative affect condition. Post-hoc analyses confirmed this finding. We discuss implications for warning pictorials and future research.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Warning effectiveness is critical in warning pictorial design, as it relates to the safety value of the message. Rogers et al. (2000) expanded the factors contributing to warning pictorial efficacy to include not only the characteristics of the warning itself, but also the context and recipients of the warning. Despite a focus on personal characteristics, the affective state of the recipient has so far been overlooked as a potential influence on comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorial. In psychology, the term ‘affect’ refers to emotion or subjectively experienced feelings, such as happiness or fear. In this study, affect encompasses emotions, mood, and feelings.It is conceivable that people who are experiencing positive affect may show improved comprehension of warning pictorials as a factor of improved productivity. For instance, Isen and colleagues reported that when people felt good, their thinking became more creative, integrative, and flexible, and they became more receptive (Isen, 1987). Positive affect can influence people to think, feel, and act in a productive way (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005).Conversely, Schwarz et al. (1991) has shown that negative emotions tend to encourage people to be more careful when processing messages. Negative emotions have an intuitively obvious adaptive value to cognitive processes, in that they narrow our thought-action repertories to those that best promoted the survival of our ancestors in life-threatening situations (Fredrickson, 2003). In the case of warning signs, which are intended to communicate information about safety issues or risks, negative affect might promote cognitive processes that facilitate hazard perception.Several studies have confirmed that affective state plays an important role in risk perception (Solvic and Peters, 2006). While positive affect is associated with a greater inclination for risk-taking, when the potential for loss is salient, individuals who are feeling good tend to have a greater concern about such loss (Isen, 1987). On the other hand, several studies have argued that negative emotion plays a powerful role in risk perception. For example, Clore and Palmer (2009) found that negative mood, such as fear, tends to focus one's attention towards relevant perceptual details.The effect of affective states on the comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials is unclear. If the perception and processing of warning pictorials varies according to affective state, the design and tests of such signs should reflect this information. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of positive and negative affective states on the comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials. It can be assumed that focused attention and cognitive processing are more important than productivity for the perception of hazards and comprehension of warning pictorials. Thus we hypothesized that negative affect would improve the comprehension and hazard perception of warning pictorials.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The present study aimed to identify potential factors that could influence the effectiveness of warning pictorials, with the goal of informing warning pictorial design and placement in terms of comprehension and hazard perception. We found that affective state influenced hazard perception of warning signs but not comprehension. People in the positive affect condition perceived warning pictorial concepts as indicating a greater hazard than those in the neutral and negative affect conditions.There are several limitations of our study. Firstly, the results of the SAM indicated that the affective state of the participants changed over time. In future studies where affective state is controlled, it may be necessary to check whether the altered affective states are stable throughout the experiment. Second, as warning pictorials are expected to be comprehensive across broad audiences, further study with a broad range of individuals with varying genders, age groups, nationalities, and cultures is necessary.
