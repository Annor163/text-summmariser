@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, the noise enhanced system performance in a binary hypothesis testing problem is investigated when the additive noise is a convex combination of the optimal noise probability density functions (PDFs) obtained in two limit cases, which are the minimization of false-alarm probability (PFA) without decreasing detection probability (PD) and the maximization ofPDwithout increasingPFA, respectively. Existing algorithms do not fully consider the relationship between the two limit cases and the optimal noise is often deduced according to only one limit case or Bayes criterion. We propose a new optimal noise framework which utilizes the two limit cases and deduce the PDFs of the new optimal noise. Furthermore, the sufficient conditions are derived to determine whether the performance of the detector can be improved or not via the new noise. In addition, the effects of the new noise are analyzed according to Bayes criterion. Rather than adjusting the additive noise again as shown in other algorithms, we just tune one parameter of the new optimal noise PDF to meet the different requirements under the Bayes criterion. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to study the theoretical results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
From the perspective of the classical signal processing theory, noise is generally regarded as disturbances to the system [1]. In addition, the weak signal is often submerged in unwanted noises. Therefore, making use of various methods to filter out the noise is an efficient measure to enhance information transmission and improve system detection performance.Nevertheless, noise does not always play a negative role for all signals and systems. On the contrary, the positive effect of noise has been paid widespread concern by researchers since Benzi first proposed the concept of stochastic resonance (SR) [2–9]. Some of the more representative studies of SR in signal and information processing are shown as below: a nonlinear bistable autoregressive model applied in signal detection by S. Zozor [4,5], the noise enhanced detection performance under the Neyman–Pearson criterion analyzed by H. Chen [7,8], etc.Naturally, the phenomenon of noise enhanced system performance, i.e. SR, can also be found in signal detection. Researches in recent years indicate that the improvement of some nonlinear systems can be obtained by increasing the background noise level or injecting additive noise to their input [9–18]. The metric of improvements can be measured by the increase of output signal-to-noise (SNR) [9] or mutual information [10], or the decrease in the average error rate [11], etc.In the hypothesis testing problem, the research on how to improve the performance of a suboptimal detector via adding an independent additive noise to their observations is usually based on Neyman–Pearson [9,12], Bayes [13,14] and Minimax criteria [15]. In fact, the noise enhancements can also be obtained for an optimal detector in some cases, as investigated in [5,12,16]. Such as, the noise enhanced performance of optimal Neyman–Pearson, Bayes and Minimax detectors are studied in [16], which proves that the performance of optimal detectors can be improved by increasing noise level of system under certain conditions.According to Neyman–Pearson criterion, the purpose is to increase the detection probability under the constraint on false-alarm probability [7,8,12]. In [7], a mathematical framework to analyze the noise enhanced effect in binary hypothesis testing problems is developed based on Neyman–Pearson criterion. The corresponding mechanism for noise enhanced signal detection is explored. Sufficient conditions for improvability or non-improvability and the form of the optimal noise PDF as a randomization of at most two discrete vector are determined at the same time. At the end of that paper, an illustrative example is presented to compare the noise enhanced performance between different detectors where the optimal stochastic resonance noise, as well as Gaussian, uniform, and optimal symmetric noises are applied. The study in [7] is extended to restricted Neyman–Pearson framework in [17] and [18], where the constraints become more strictly. The aim in [18] is to maximize the average detection probability under the constraint on false-alarm and worst-case detection probabilities.In the Bayes framework, the prior information is known, while it is unknown in the Minimax framework, the purpose of them is to minimize the Bayes risk. Besides, the restricted Bayes criterion is well suited in the case of prior information with some uncertainty which is most common in practical life. In [13], the effects of additive independent noise on the performance of some suboptimal detectors are investigated according to restricted Bayes criterion. In other words, the aim is to find the optimal noise which can minimize the Bayes risk under certain constraints on the conditional risk. Based on a generic M-ary composite hypothesis-testing formulation, the optimal probability distribution of additive noise and the sufficient conditions which the performance of a detector can or cannot be improved via additive noise are derived. Besides, it studies the simple hypothesis-testing problems in more detail, such as the solution of the optimization problem of additive noise for binary case. It is obvious that the noise enhanced problem in Bayes framework and Minimax framework [15] can be viewed as special cases in restricted Bayes framework.Based on the analysis of articles related to Bayes, we have noticed an interesting phenomenon that people always regard the Bayes risk as a whole in binary hypothesis testing problems and ignore it can be expanded as a sum of a constant and a linear combination of detection and false-alarm probabilities. These methods can reduce the Bayes risk, but may not guarantee false alarm and detection performance of detector improved at the same time. If the optimal solution of Bayes risk is deduced by the optimization of detection and false-alarm probabilities directly, the problem can be solved more easily in some cases. Based on this conception, the minimization of Bayes risk is equivalent to the decrease of false alarm probability and the increase of detection probability simultaneously.However, it is hard to find the optimal additive noise directly to satisfy the conditions that false alarm probability reduced and detection probability increased after adding the additive noise. Hence, we first find the optimal noises minimize false alarm probability without decreasing detection probability and maximize detection probability without increasing false alarm probability, respectively, then deduce the optimal noise for the minimum Bayes risk through the linear weighted combination of the two optimal noises.Most researchers have focused mainly on improving the detection probability. For example, the case of maximizing detection probability without increasing false alarm probability is researched in [7,8]. But so far, no study has involved in minimizing the false alarm probability without decreasing the detection probability, which is also very important in binary hypothesis testing problems. Therefore, the aim of this paper includes how to minimize the false alarm probability without decreasing the detection probability via independent additive noise, obtain the corresponding optimal noise and derive the sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we find the optimal noise which can decrease false alarm probability and increase detection probability simultaneously, derive the corresponding sufficient conditions. More importantly, the minimization of Bayes risk can be achieved according to the analysis of false-alarm and detection probabilities above. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:•Formulation of the noise enhanced model, which can increase the detection probability and decrease the probability of false-alarm at the same time.Determination of the optimal additive noise to minimize the false-alarm without decreasing detection probability, which is a randomization of two discrete vectors.Derivation of the suitable additive noise corresponding to our noise enhanced model, which is a suitable randomization of no more than four constant vectors obtained through the convex combination between the optimal noise PDFs of two limit cases.Derivation of the sufficient conditions for two limit cases and our noise enhanced model.Determination of the additive noise and the corresponding PDF which can minimize the Bayes risk according to the Bayes and Minimax criteria in certain conditions based on the analysis of the noise enhanced model.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the binary hypothesis test problem formulation is given and a noise enhanced model based on the improvements of both the false-alarm and detection performance is proposed. The corresponding optimal additive noise and sufficient conditions for different cases are derived in Section 3. Then, the minimization of Bayes risk according to the Bayes and Minimax criteria under certain conditions is researched in Section 4. Finally, a detection example and the experiment results are presented in Section 5 and conclusions are made in Section 6.Consider the binary hypothesis-testing problem as below:(1)Hi:pi(x),i=0,1,wherepi(x)represents the PDF of x underHi, and x is a K-dimensional observation vector, i.e.,x∈RK. The decision rule is usually expressed asϕ(x), which represents the probability of selectingH1,0≤ϕ(x)≤1. As a result, the probabilities of false alarm and detection are provided by(2)PFAx=∫RKϕ(x)p0(x)dx,(3)PDx=∫RKϕ(x)p1(x)dx.The noise modified observation y is given by adding an independent noise n to x, i.e.,y=x+n. Then the PDF of y underHican be expressed by the convolutions ofpi(x)andϕ(x)as follows,(4)pi(y)=pn(⋅)⁎pi(x)=∫RKpn(n)pi(y−n)dn.When the detector is fixed, the decision function of y is the same as that of x, namelyϕ(y)=ϕ(x). Therefore, the new probabilities of false alarm and detection for y can be shown as below,(5)PFAy=∫RKϕ(y)p0(y)dy=∫RKpn(n)(∫RKϕ(y)p0(y−n)dy)dn=∫RKpn(n)F0(n)dn=En(F0(n)),(6)PDy=∫RKϕ(y)p1(y)dy=∫RKpn(n)F1(n)dn=En(F1(n)),where(7)Fi(n)=∫RKϕ(y)pi(y−n)dy.From (5) and (6), we shall hereafter considerPFAyandPDyare the mathematical expectations ofF0(n)andF1(n)based onpn(n), respectively. In a special case, the additive noise is a direct current (DC) signaln0, andpn(n)=δ(n−n0), then the false alarm and detection probabilities of y areF0(n)andF1(n), respectively. Especially, ifn=0, theny=x+0=x,PFAx=F0(0)andPDx=F1(0). Therefore, the probabilities of false alarm and detection can be adjusted by adding noise. The additive noise modified detector is shown as Fig. 1.According to the problem formulation described above, a noise enhanced model which can increase the detection probability and decrease the false-alarm probability simultaneously is proposed in this paper, which is at the core of our discussion. In other words, the additive noise makes the following equations achievable,(8){PFAy=PFAx−z1,0≤z1≤PFAxPDy=PDx+z2,0≤z2≤1−PDx,wherez1andz2represent the improvement ofPFAandPDfor the noise modified observation y compared to the original observation x, respectively. From (8), it is clear that a preferable measure to improve the detector performance would increase the value ofz1+z2, the more, the better. Whenz1+z2reaches the maximum value, the improvement of the detector performance is most obvious and the corresponding noise is optimal. Obviously, it is hard to solve the optimal noise from (8) directly if we try to maximize bothz1andz2at the same time. Therefore, we first consider two limit cases as follows.(i)Assuming the detection probability of noise enhanced detector is equal to the original detector, the minimization of the false-alarm probability is analyzed in this case. Namely, ifz2=0, the maximum valuez1oofz1is obtained via additive noise with PDFpn,1opt(n). Combined with (5), (6) and (8),PFAyandPDyin this case are shown as(9){PFA,opty=∫RKpn,1opt(n)F0(n)dn=PFAx−z1oPDy=∫RKpn,1opt(n)F1(n)dn=PDx+0.Just opposite to case (i), ifPFAy=PFAx, the maximization of the detection probability is deduced in this case. In other words, ifz1=0, the maximum valuez2oofz2is obtained by adding the optimal noise with the PDFpn,2opt(n). In this scenario,PFAyandPDycan be expressed by(10){PFAy=∫RKpn,2opt(n)F0(n)dn=PFAx−0PD,opty=∫RKpn,2opt(n)F1(n)dn=PDx+z2o.In order to find a noise n with PDFpn(n)to satisfy the noise enhanced model given in (8), we can exploit the optimal noise PDFspn,1opt(n)andpn,2opt(n)obtained from case (i) and case (ii) to make a convex combination as below,(11)pn(n)=ηpn,1opt(n)+(1−η)pn,2opt(n),0≤η≤1.The correspondingPFAyobtained by adding the noise n shown in (11) as follows,(12)PFAy=∫RKpn(n)F0(n)dn=∫RK[ηpn,1opt(n)+(1−η)pn,2opt(n)]F0(n)dn=η∫RKpn,1opt(n)F0(n)dn+(1−η)∫RKpn,2opt(n)F0(n)dn=η(PFAx−z1o)+(1−η)(PFAx+0)=PFAx−ηz1o.Similarly,(13)PDy=∫RKpn(n)F1(n)dn=PDx+(1−η)z2o.The combined expression of these two formulas is shown as below,(14){PFAy=PFAx−ηz1o<PFAxPDy=PDx+(1−η)z2o>PDx.Comparing (8) with (14), we can see thatz1=ηz1oandz2=(1−η)z2o. According to different application requirements, the different improvements ofPFAandPDcan be obtained by adjusting the value of η as shown in (14). To facilitate the description, we shall hereafter call the case shown in (14) as case (iii).Ifz1o=z2o=z, thenz1+z2=ηz1o+(1−η)z2o=z, i.e., whatever η is, the value ofz1+z2is equal to z. In other words, the overall improvement ofPFAandPDin case (iii) is always equal to the improvement obtained in either one of the limit cases. In a more general,z1o≠z2oandmin⁡(z1o,z2o)<z1+z2<max⁡(z1o,z2o), wherez1+z2=ηz1o+(1−η)z2o=z2o+η(z1o−z2o). Namely, the sum value of the improved detection probability and the reduced false-alarm probability is between minimum and maximum of the improvements in the two extreme cases (i) and (ii). Besides, compared with [9], the noise enhanced system formulated here not only takes the false alarm probability into account, but also adjusts η to get different improvements ofPFAandPDunder the condition of maximizing the overall improvement according to actual demand. Furthermore, ifz1o>z2o, the total improvements in case (iii) is better than that in [8].In this section, the corresponding additive noises for two limit cases and noise enhanced model are deduced, the sufficient conditions whether or not enhance the detection performance for different cases are determined.Restate limit case (i) as follows,(15){minpn(n)⁡PFAy=minpn(n)⁡∫RKpn(n)F0(n)dnPDy=∫RKpn(n)F1(n)dn=PDx.So as to acquire the optimal noise in case (i), we can make full use of the relationship betweenFi(n)andpn(n). From (7),Fi(n)is a function with respect to (w.r.t.) n. LetF1(n)=f1, thenn=F1−1(f1), whereF1−1is the inverse function ofF1. Takingf1as the variable toF0(n), we haveF0(n)=f0=F0(F1−1(f1)). Based on the definition ofF0(n)andF1(n), where0<f0,f1<1. The relationship betweenf1and n is one-to-one or one-to-multiple, so the correspondingf0forf1may be a unique or set vector. If the noise PDFpn(⋅)in the originalRKdomain is determined, the noise PDFpn,f1(f1)in thef1domain can also be uniquely determined. Accordingly, the equivalent form of (15) can be rewritten as follows,(16){minpn,f1(f1)⁡PFAy=minpn,f1(f1)⁡∫01pn,f1(f1)f0df1PDy=∫01pn,f1(f1)f1df1=PDx.Compared (15) with (16) and under the constraint condition ofPDy=PDx, the optimal noise is solved inf1domain instead ofRKdomain. As a consequence,pn,f1(f1)is the optimal noise PDF which meets the requirement of (16).From the inference of (5), (6) and (7),f0=F0(n0)andf1=F1(n0)are the false-alarm and detection probabilities obtained by adding a DC signal with PDFpn(n)=δ(n−n0)to observation x. LetA={(f0,f1)|f0=F0(n),f1=F1(n),n∈RK}be the set of all pairs of(f0,f1). Further, let B be the convex hull of A, i.e.,B={∑i=1Nζi(f0i,f1i)|(f0i,f1i)∈A,∑i=1Nζi=1,ζi∈[0,1]}. Similarly, letM={(PFAy,PDy)|PFAy=∫01f0pn,f1df1,PDy=∫01f1pn,f1df1}be the set of all possible(PFAy,PDy). According to [7],M=B, namely M is the convex hull of A.Based on Caratheodory's Theorem, an element in M can be expressed by a convex combination ofDim(B)+1points in A. Because we want to minimizePFAwhile not decreasePD, the optimal pair of(PFAy,PDy)will be located on the boundary of M. Each point on the boundary of M can be expressed as a convex combination ofDim(B)=2points in A, i.e.,(17)(PFA,opty,PD,opty)=ζ(f01,f11)+(1−ζ)(f02,f12),where(f01,f11),(f02,f12)∈A,0≤ζ≤1. Therefore, the optimal noise PDF is determined by(18)pn,f1opt(f1)=ζδ(f1−f11)+(1−ζ)δ(f1−f12).Equivalently,(19)pn,1opt(n)=ζδ(n−n11)+(1−ζ)δ(n−n12),wheren11is determined byF0(n11)=f01andF1(n11)=f11, andn12is deduced byF0(n12)=f02andF1(n12)=f12.In order to achieve the minimum of false-alarm probability without reducingPD, we can consider the minimization of false-alarm probability via adding a DC signal as additive noise firstly. LetΓ(t)=inf⁡(f0:f1=t)be the minimum off0for a given value off1. Obviously,Γ(PDx)≤F0(0)=PFAx. Then we havePFAy≥∫01Γ(f1)pn,f1(f1)df1=En(Γ)combined with (5).LetF0m=min⁡(Γ(t))andt0=arg⁡maxt(Γ(t)=F0m). Ift0<PDx, thenPD,opty=ζf11+(1−ζ)f12=PDx. We can use an auxiliary functionH(⋅)given below to derive the optimal noise PDF,(20)H(f1,c)=Γ(f1)−cf1,wherec∈R. Then we have(21)PFAy≥En(Γ)=En(H(f1,c))+cEn(f1)≥En(H(f1,c))+cPDx,whereEn(f1)=∫01f1pn,f1(f1)df1=PDy≥PDx. Hence, under the constraint condition ofPD,opty=PDx, the minimization ofPFA,optyis equivalent to minimization ofEn(H(f1,c)). Dividing the domain off1into two intervals asI1=[0,PDx]andI2=[PDx,1], we can find at least onec0>0to make the minimum of H inI1(i.e.,υ1(c0)) equals to the minimum of H inI2(i.e.,υ2(c0)), namelyυ1(c0)=υ2(c0)=υ. Accordingly, the maximums off1inI1andI2corresponding to υ are denoted byf11(c0)andf12(c0), respectively. Similar to the analysis in [7] and combined with (21), the conclusions can be obtained as follows,(22)PFA,opty=En(H)+c0PDx=υ+c0PDx,(23)z1o=PFAx−PFA,opty.The corresponding optimal noise PDF ispn,f1opt(f1)=ζδ(f1−f11(c0))+(1−ζ)δ(f1−f12(c0)). From the equationPD,opty=PDx, the value of ζ can be solved asζ=(f12(c0)−PDx)/(f12(c0)−f11(c0)). Then(24)pn,f1opt(f1)=f12(c0)−PDxf12(c0)−f11(c0)δ(f1−f11(c0))+PDx−f11(c0)f12(c0)−f11(c0)δ(f1−f12(c0)),(25)pn,1opt(n)=f12(c0)−PDxf12(c0)−f11(c0)δ(n−n11)+PDx−f11(c0)f12(c0)−f11(c0)δ(n−n12),wheren11is determined byF1(n11)=f11(c0)andF0(n11)=υ+c0f11(c0),n12is determined byF1(n12)=f12(c0)andF0(n12)=υ+c0f12(c0). Specially, whenf0and H are continuously differentiable, becauseH(f11(c0),c0)andH(f12(c0),c0)are the minimums in different intervals, then∂H∂f1(f11(c0),c0)=∂H∂f1(f12(c0),c0)=0. Hence, from the derivative of (20), we have(26)∂Γ∂f1(f11(c0))=∂Γ∂f1(f12(c0))=c0,(27)Γ(f12(c0))−Γ(f11(c0))=c0(f12(c0)−f11(c0)).If we find out the point satisfying (26) and (27), thenc0,f11(c0)andf12(c0)can be determined. Furthermore, the correspondingn11andn12can also be determined.From [7], the optimal noise PDF andPDyin limit case (ii) are expressed as follows,(28)pn,f0opt(f0)=f02(k0)−PFAxf02(k0)−f01(k0)δ(f0−f01(k0))+PFAx−f01(k0)f02(k0)−f01(k0)δ(f0−f02(k0)),(29)PD,opty=ν+k0PFAx,z2o=PD,opty−PDx,wherek0∈R. LetG(τ)=sup⁡(f1:f0=τ)be the maximum off1for a givenf0. LetF1M=max⁡G(τ)andτ0=arg⁡minτ(G(τ)=F1M). Ifτ0>PFAx, there exists an equal maximum ν ofJ(f0,k)=G(f0)−kf0inI1=[0,PFAx]andI2=[PFAx,1]by adjusting k. The k for ν is denoted byk0. The minimums off0corresponding to ν in the two intervals are represented byf01(k0)andf02(k0), respectively. The optimal noise PDF inRKdomain is obtained as (30) according to (28),(30)pn,2opt(n)=λδ(n−n21)+(1−λ)δ(n−n22),whereλ=(f02(k0)−PFAx)/(f02(k0)−f01(k0)),n21is determined byF1(n21)=ν+k0f01(k0)andF0(n21)=f01(k0),n22is determined byF1(n22)=ν+k0f02(k0)andF0(n22)=f02(k0).The PDF of additive noise for case (iii) or noise enhanced model can be obtained by a convex combination of two optimal PDFs shown in (19) and (30) according to (11), i.e.,(31)pn(n)=ηζδ(n−n11)+η(1−ζ)δ(n−n12)+(1−η)λδ(n−n21)+(1−η)(1−λ)δ(n−n22)Namely, the additive noise for case (iii) is a discrete random signal consisting of four constant vectors and their corresponding weights. Besides, we can adjust η to meet different application requirements. Combing with (14), we can see to what extentPFAandPDcan be improved are partly affected by the choice of η. Specially,η=1corresponds to case (i) andη=0corresponds to case (ii). According to (14), if we want to pay more attention to the increase ofPD, we should make0<η<0.5. Otherwise, if we want to pay more attention to the decrease ofPFAx, we should make0.5<η<1. As a result, we can choose a suitable η to meet different requirements. Once the value of η is determined, the corresponding additive noise for case (iii) as shown in (31) can be also determined. We can see that the suitable noise in case (iii) is adaptive to different requirements of detection performance by adjusting the value of η. In addition, ift0≥PDxorτ0<PFAx, the optimal additive noise for noise enhanced model defined in (8) is a DC signalnowith PDFpn(n)=δ(n−no). Ift0≥PDx,nois determined byPFA,opty=F0(no)=F0mandPD,opty=F1(no)=t0. Ifτ0<PFAx,nois determined byPFA,opty=F0(no)=τ0andPD,opty=F1(no)=F1M.For a large class of detectors, according to the specific properties of Γ and G, we can find the sufficient conditions for improvability or nonimprovability of three cases. These conditions are given as follows.1) Case (i)Theorem 1IfΓ(PDx)<PFAxorΓ″(PDx)<0whenΓ(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundPDx, then there exists at least one noise with PDFpn(n)which can decrease the false alarm probability.Theorem 2If there is non-decreasing convex functionΦ(f1)whereΦ(PDx)=Γ(PDx)=F0(0)=PFAxandΦ(f1)≤Γ(f1)for everyf1, thenPFAy≥PFAxfor any independent additional noise.2) Case (ii)Theorem 3IfG(PFAx)>PDxorG″(PFAx)>0whenG(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundPFAx, then there exists at least one noisenwith PDFpn(n)which can improve the detection probability.If there is non-decreasing concave functionΨ(f0)whereΨ(PFAx)=G(PFAx)=F1(0)=PDxandΨ(f0)≥G(f0)for everyf0, thenPDy≤PDxfor any independent additive noise.3) Case (iii)Theorem 5a)G(Γ(PDx))>PDxwhenΓ(PDx)<PFAx; b)Γ(G(PFAx))<PFAxwhenG(PFAx)>PDx; c)Γ″(G(PFAx))<0whenΓ(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundG(PFAx); d)G″(Γ(PDx))>0whenG(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundΓ(PDx). If any one of the four conditions is true, there is at least one additive noise with PDFpn(n)which can increase the detection probability and decrease the false-alarm probability simultaneously.Proofa) IfG(Γ(PDx))>PDxwhenΓ(PDx)<PFAx, from the definitions of Γ and G, there exists at least one noisen0such thatF0(n0)=Γ(PDx)<PFAxandF1(n0)=G(Γ(PDx))>PDx. Therefore, the detection and the false-alarm performance can be enhanced by adding an SR noise with PDFpn(n)=δ(n−n0). Similarly, b) can be proved to be true. c)Γ″(G(PFAx))<0whenΓ(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundG(PFAx), then there exists aξ>0such thatΓ″(⋅)<0onΔ=(G(PFAx)−ξ,G(PFAx)+ξ). Let us add a noise with PDFpn,f1(f1)=12δ(f1−(G(PFAx)−12ξ))+12δ(f1−(G(PFAx)+12ξ)), then we havePFAy=∫01Γ(f1)pn,f1(f1)df1=12Γ(G(PFAx)−12ξ)+12Γ(G(PFAx)+12ξ). Based on the concavity ofΓ(t)and the definitions of Γ and G, we havePFA,opty<Γ(G(PFAx))≤PFAx, and the correspondingPDy=∫01f1pn,f1(f1)df1=G(PFAx)≥PDx. d) IfG″(Γ(PDx))>0whenG(t)is second-order continuously differentiable aroundΓ(PDx), similarly there exists aξ>0such thatG″(⋅)>0onΔ=(Γ(PDx)−ξ,Γ(PDx)+ξ). If the additive noise PDF ispn,f0(f0)=12δ(f0−(G(Γ(PDx))−12ξ))+12δ(f0−(G(Γ(PDx))+12ξ)), thenPDy=∫01G(f0)pn,f0(f0)df0=12(G(Γ(PDx))−12ξ))+12(G(Γ(PDx))+12ξ)). Due to the convexity ofG(t)and the definitions of Γ and G, we obtainPDy>G(Γ(PDx))≥PDx, and the relatedPFAy=∫01f0pn,f0(f0)df0=Γ(PDx)≤PFAx. Therefore, the detection and the false-alarm probabilities can be enhanced by adding an SR noise for these four conditions. □Theorem 6If the false-alarm probability cannot be decreased by adding any additive noise to observationxand there is a non-increasing concave functionΨ(f0)whereΨ(PFAx)=G(PFAx)=F1(0)=PDxandΨ(f0)≥G(f0)for everyf0,PDy≤PDxfor any independent additive noise.Proof(32)PDy≤∫01G(f0)pn,f0(f0)df0≤∫01Ψ(f0)pn,f0(f0)df0≤Ψ(∫01f0pn,f0(f0)df0)≤Ψ(PFAx)=PDx.□Theorem 7If the detection probability cannot be increased by adding any additive noise and there is a non-increasing convex functionΦ(f1)whereΦ(PDx)=Γ(PDx)=F0(0)=PFAxandΦ(f1)≤Γ(f1)for everyf1, thenPFAy≥PFAxfor any independent additional noise.Proof(33)PFAy≥∫01Γ(f1)pn,f1(f1)df1≥∫01Φ(f1)pn,f1(f1)df1≥Φ(∫01f1pn,f1(f1)df1)≥Φ(PDx)=PFAx.□This section further analyzes the performance of noise enhanced system according to Bayes criterion whose basic view is to make an average decision cost minimum. The Bayes risk obtained by adding noise to x can be expressed as(34)C=∑i=01p(Hi)Ciy(ϕ),wherep(Hi),i=0,1, denotes the prior probability ofHi, andCiy(ϕ)is defined as the conditional risk of ϕ givenHifor noise modified observation y[15], i.e.,(35)Ciy=∑j=01Cjip(Hj|Hi),whereCjiandp(Hj|Hi)represent the cost and the probability of choosingHjwhenHiis true. Thenp(H1|H0)=PFAy,p(H0|H0)=1−PFAy,p(H1|H1)=PDyandp(H0|H1)=1−PDy. Eq. (34) can be expanded as(36)C=p(H0)C00+p(H1)C01+p(H0)(C10−C00)PFAy−p(H1)(C01−C11)PDy.Due top(Hi)andCjiare known, and generallyCji>Cii,j≠i, the optimization of Bayes risk is equivalent to the improvement ofPFAand/orPDwhich is the core concerned in Section 3. Combined with (8), the Bayes risk in (36) can be rewritten as(37)C=p(H0)C00+p(H1)C01+p(H0)(C10−C00)(PFAx−z1)−p(H1)(C01−C11)(PDx+z2)=Co−[p(H0)(C10−C00)z1+p(H1)(C01−C11)z2],whereCo=p(H0)C00+p(H1)C01+p(H0)(C10−C00)PFAx−p(H1)(C01−C11)PDxrepresents the Bayes risk of the original observation x. SinceC10>C00,C01>C11, and0<P(Hi)<1, then we haveC<Co. From the analysis above, the minimization of C can be equivalent to the maximization ofz1and/orz2i.e., the optimal solution of the additive noise in case (iii). Therefore, when we add a noise with PDF as shown in (31) to x,(38)C=Co−[p(H0)(C10−C00)ηz1o+p(H1)(C01−C11)(1−η)z2o]=Co−[p(H1)(C01−C11)z2o+η(p(H0)(C10−C00)z1o−p(H1)(C01−C11)z2o)],wherez1oandz2oare determined from limit case (i) and (ii) respectively. Ifp(H0)(C10−C00)z1o−p(H1)(C01−C11)z2o>0, thenη=1otherwiseη=0. Notably, even η takes any value between 0 and 1, there is stillC<Co, i.e., the performance of noise enhanced detector is still better than the original detector. Comparing with [13], we consider the optimization of variablesPFAyandPDycaused by noise instead of the optimization of C as a whole, which not only ensures the optimal performance, but also simplifies the calculation. When the detector is fixed, there is no need to repeat the solution process of the additive noise again and only recalculate η to obtain the corresponding optimal additive noise with the change ofp(Hi)and/orCji. In the following discussion, we can see the advantage of this algorithm whenp(Hi)is unknown.Specially, whenCjiis known andp(Hi)is unknown, Minimax criterion can be adopted to reduce the maximum of the condition risks for different hypotheses as small as possible. The minimization of C is equivalent to the minimization ofmax⁡(C0y(ϕ),C1y(ϕ)),(39)C0y(ϕ)=C00(1−PFAy)+C10PFAy=C00+(C10−C00)PFAy,(40)C1y(ϕ)=C01(1−PDy)+C11PDy=C01−(C01−C11)PDy.Solutions of the minimum values of (39) and (40) correspond to the solutions of limit case (i) and (ii), respectively. The minimization ofmax⁡(C0y(ϕ),C1y(ϕ))in [15] is a non-linear process, the corresponding optimal additive noise is regarded aspnopt(n). Due toCjiis known, onlyPFAyandPDycan be influenced bypnopt(n). From the analysis in Sections 2 and 3, under the constraint of both the false-alarm and detection probabilities of noise enhanced detector are not worse than the original detector,pn,1opt(n)andpn,2opt(n)are additive noises which makePFAyandPDyoptimal, respectively. We haveminpnopt(n)PFAy≥minpn,1opt(n)⁡PFAyandminpnopt(n)⁡PDy≤minpn,2opt(n)⁡PDy. Therefore, the algorithm in this paper is better than [15].In this section, we consider the same detection example in [7] and [8]. The two hypotheses are defined as(41){H0:x[i]=ω[i]H1:x[i]=A+ω[i],wherei=0,1,⋯,K−1,A>0is a known constant that represents the DC signal, andω[i]are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) symmetric Gaussian mixture noise samples with the following PDF(42)pω(ω)=12γ(ω;−μ,σ2)+12γ(ω;μ,σ2),whereγ(ω;μ,σ2)=(1/2πσ2)exp⁡[−(ω−μ)2/2σ2], μ andσ2are the mean and the variance of the Gaussian distribution, respectively. Letμ=3,A=1, andσ=1in this example. WhenK=1, the decision rule is denoted by(43)ϕ(x)={1,x>00,x≤0.The distribution of x under theH0andH1can be expressed as(44)p0(x)=12γ(x;−μ,σ2)+12γ(x;μ,σ2),(45)p1(x)=12γ(x;−μ+A,σ2)+12γ(x;μ+A,σ2).Under the two constraint conditions of the detector is fixed and the additive noise is i.i.d.,PDandPFAare the same for every detector. So the detector is equivalent to a fusion of K individual detectors whenK>1and the detection performance is monotonically increasing with K. Therefore, for the case ofK>1the optimal additive noise is the same as the one in caseK=1. As a result, we only need to consider the case ofK=1.Sinceϕ(x)are known, from (7),(46)F0(n)=∫0+∞ϕ(y)p0(y−n)dy=12Q(−n+μσ)+12Q(−n−μσ).Similarly,(47)F1(n)=∫0+∞ϕ(y)p1(y−n)dy=12Q(−n+μ−Aσ)+12Q(−n−μ−Aσ),whereQ(x)=∫x+∞(1/2π)exp⁡(−t2/2)dt. Thus, the original detection and false-alarm probabilities are determined byPDx=F1(0)=0.5114andPFAx=F0(0)=0.5. From the definition of Q, we know thatF1(n)>F0(n), the relationship betweenF1(n)andF0(n)is one-to-one, and both of them are monotonically increasing with x. Therefore, we haveΓ(f1)=f0(f1)=f0andG(f0)=f1(f0)=f1. The relationship betweenF0(n)andF1(n)is shown as Fig. 2.The region between blue curve and the red imaginary line in Fig. 2 represents the region where the false-alarm probability may be decreased by injecting noise to observation, where the red imaginary line is the tangent between(f11,f01)and(f12,f02). At the same time, this region is also the region where the detection probability can be increased from [7]. From Fig. 2, in this example the relationship betweenf01(k0)andf11(c0)is one-to-one correspondence, and the relationship betweenf02(k0)andf12(c0)is also one-to-one correspondence. Namely,n11=n21=n1andn12=n22=n2. From [8],n1andn2are approximately expressed as(48)n1=−μ−0.5A,(49)n2=+μ−0.5A.In order to analyze the improvement of performance after adding different noises, the calculation of false-alarm and detection probabilities are carried out respectively under three different conditions as follows.For limit case (i),ζ=(F1(n2)−F1(0))/(F1(n2)−F1(n1))=0.6687, the optimal noise PDF is denoted bypn,1opt(n)=ζδ(n−n1)+(1−ζ)δ(n−n2), the corresponding false-alarm and detection probabilities are shown as(50){PFA,opty=ζF0(n1)+(1−ζ)F0(n2)=0.3199<PFAxPDy=ζF1(n1)+(1−ζ)F1(n2)=0.5114=PDx.For limit case (ii),λ=(F0(n2)−F0(0))/(F0(n2)−F0(n1))=0.3085and the related optimal noise PDF ispn,2opt(n)=λδ(n−n1)+(1−λ)δ(n−n2). Besides, the corresponding false-alarm and detection probabilities can be expressed as(51){PFAy=λF0(n1)+(1−λ)F0(n2)=0.5=PFAxPD,opty=λF1(n1)+(1−λ)F1(n2)=0.6915>PDx.For case (iii),pn,3(n)=ηpn,1opt(n)+(1−η)pn,2opt(n)=[ηζ+(1−η)λ]δ(n−n1)+[(η(1−ζ)+(1−η)(1−λ)]δ(n−n2). Whenη=0.5the corresponding false-alarm and detection probabilities are shown as below,(52){PFAy=ρF0(n1)+(1−ρ)F0(n2)=0.4099<PFAxPDy=ρF1(n1)+(1−ρ)F1(n2)=0.6014>PDx,whereρ=ηζ+(1−η)λ=0.4886. Obviously, the new noise obtained by convex combination ofpn,1opt(n)andpn,2opt(n)can not only decrease the false-alarm probability but also increase the detection probability.Based on the analysis of false-alarm and detection probabilities in two limit cases,z1o=z2o=0.1801in this example. It is assumed that the prior probabilities andCjiare given,p(H0)=0.4,p(H1)=0.6andC00=C11=0,C10=C01=1. The Bayes risk obtained via additive noise according to (38) is expressed as(53)C=Co−[p(H1)z2o+η(p(H0)z1o−p(H1)z2o)],whereCois the Bayes risk of the original detector andCo=p(H0)PFAx+p(H1)(1−PDx)=0.4932. Obviously,p(H0)z1o−p(H1)z2o<0, the Bayes risk is optimal whenη=0andC=0.3851. Even though the improvement of the Bayes risk is the smallest whenη=1, the performance is still superior to the original detector, i.e.,C=0.4212<Co=0.4932. Ifη=0.5, we haveC=0.4032<C0. For any value of η between 0 and 1, it is clearly that the results of this example are consistent with the theoretical analysis as shown in (37) and (38) in Section 4. Another important point to be noted from the example is that the corresponding optimal Bayes risk and noise PDF can be obtained by recalculating the value of η with differentp(Hi)andCji.For the purpose of analysis, the symbols that used in the simulation are written again as follows: A is the DC signal, σ and μ are the parameters of the background noise PDFpω(ω)as shown in (42), ζ and λ are the weights as shown in (19) and (30), respectively, and η is the parameter given in (11).In Fig. 3, the detection and false-alarm probabilities of limit cases (i), (ii), (iii) and the original detector for different values of A are illustrated. As shown in Fig. 3, with the increase of A,PFAxmaintains 0.5,PDxincreases gradually from 0.5 to 1. In case (iii), the false-alarm probability first decreases to a certain extent and then increases after adding noise. WhenA=2, the minimumPFAy=0.3690in case (iii) is obtained, it decreases 0.1310 compared with limit case (ii) and the original detector as shown in Fig. 3(a). The corresponding detection probability in case (iii) isPDy=0.7103whenA=2as shown in Fig. 3(b). Though the improvement ofPDyin case (iii) is lower than that in limit case (ii), it improves 0.1310 than the original detector and limit case (i). Therefore, in the noise enhanced model expressed as case (iii) in this paper, we can not only increase the detection probability but also decrease the false-alarm probability.The detection and false-alarm probabilities for different σ of background noise in limit cases (i), (ii), case (iii) and the original detector are compared in Fig. 4. With the increase of σ, the detection probability of the original detector first maintains 0.5, then it gradually decreases after reaching the maximum 0.5807. When σ is close to 0, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the false-alarm probability acquired in case (iii) is improved 0.25 than limit case (ii) and the original detector,PDis approximately equal to 0.75 in case (iii) as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). With the increase of σ, the false-alarm probabilities in limit case (i) and case (iii) increase gradually from Fig. 4(a), while the detection probabilities in limit case (ii) and case (iii) decrease gradually from Fig. 4(b). Namely, the performance of detector after adding noise to observation is decreased with the increase of σ. Whenσ≥σ1as shown in Fig. 4, due topω(ω)becomes a unimodal noise and ϕ is fixed, the detector performance cannot be improved by adding any noise.Fig. 5plots the detection and false-alarm probabilities of limit cases (i), (ii), case (iii), and the original detector w.r.t. μ whenη=0.5,A=3andσ=1. With the increase of μ,PDxdecreases gradually from 0.84135 to 0.5, whilePFAxremains 0.5. As shown in Fig. 5, whenμ<μ0,pω(ω)becomes a unimodal noise and the original detector is optimal. Whenμ>μ0, with the increase of μ, ζ and λ are close to be 0.6915 and 0.3085, respectively. In case (iii),PFAygradually decreases to 0.4043 from Fig. 5(a), whilePDydecreases from 0.8143 to 0.5957 as shown in Fig. 5(b). Comparing the improvement of detection probability obtained in case (iii) with that in limit case (ii), we know that the difference between them is the same as the false-alarm difference between case (iii) and the original detector. As a consequence, we can exploit the method of case (iii) to achieve the goal of increasing the detection probability and decreasing the false-alarm probability simultaneously.Finally, Fig. 6illustrates the curves for different η whenK=30. Ifη=1, it represents limit case (i). Ifη=0, it denotes limit case (ii). The blue dots represent the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the original detector without adding noise. As shown in Fig. 6, no matter what η is, the ROC of case (iii) is better than the original detector. Furthermore, ifz1o>z2o, taking an appropriate value of η can make the ROC of case (iii) better than limit case (ii).Figs. 7, 8 and 9illustrate the Bayes risks of noise enhanced detector and the original detector for different values of A, σ, and μ whenp(H0)=0.4. From (35), the improvement of Bayes risk is equivalent to the improvement of false-alarm and detection probabilities. It is observed in Fig. 7 that as A increases, the improvement of Bayes risk obtained via additive noise increases at first and then decreases, the maximum is achieved whenA=2and gradually reduces to 0 whenA≥5. As shown in Fig. 8, with the increase of σ, the improvement obtained via additive noise decreases, the optimal additive noise is zero whenσ≥σ1. In Fig. 9, the improvement obtained via additive noise increases to a constant as μ increases. It is clearly to see that the change trend of the Bayes risks in Figs. 7, 8 and 9 are similar to the trend of false-alarm and detection probabilities in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Therefore, Figs. 3–9 imply that, the improvement of Bayes risk obtained via additive noise is actually determined by the improvement ofPDandPFAobtained via additive noise in case (iii) with the suitable value of η as deduced above, which is expected due to the same reasons argued in Section 3.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The existed algorithms only consider how to improve the detection probability, but have limited ability to decrease the false-alarm probability which is also very important in practice. Therefore, we have proposed a noise enhanced model in the binary hypothesis testing scenarios in this paper, where the optimal additive noise is added to increase the detection probability and decrease the false-alarm probability simultaneously. To give the exact form of the corresponding optimal additional noise for the noise enhanced model, we have established a convex combination of the two optimal noise PDFs from two limit cases, which are the minimization ofPFAwithout decreasingPDand the maximization ofPDwithout decreasingPFA, respectively. In addition, the sufficient conditions for different cases have been determined. Furthermore, the noise enhanced binary hypothesis testing according to Bayes criterion has been analyzed in detail and a conclusion that the minimization of Bayes risk is equivalent to the decrease ofPFAand increase ofPDhas been given. Then the optimal additive noise for the minimization of Bayes risk according to Bayes and Minimax criteria has been deduced by applying the expression we have developed in case (iii), and it could be obtained only by recalculating a parameter with the change of prior information. Finally, a detection example and experiment results have been given to illustrate our algorithm have superior performance in some cases and can be applied in many practical applications.
