@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Recent press has highlighted the environmental benefits associated with online shopping, such as emissions savings from individual drivers, economies of scale in package delivery, and decreased inventories. We formulate a dual channel model for a retailer who has access to both online and traditional market outlets to analyze the impact of customer environmental sensitivity on its supply. In particular, we analyze stocking decisions for each channel incorporating price dependent demand, customer preference/utility for online channels, and channel related costs. We compare and contrast results from both deterministic and stochastic models, and utilize numerical examples to illustrate the implications of industry specific factors on these decisions. Finally, we compare and contrast the findings for disparate industries, such as electronics, books and groceries.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we analyze a dual channel model for a retailer who has access to both online and traditional market outlets to answer several key research questions regarding the environmental impact of the dual channel strategy for retail. The first question we address is, “If a retailer has both traditional and online sales channels, how should he/she manage the split between these?” In particular, we analyze three potential strategies for the retailer: the traditional retail channel only (RC), the online channel only (OC), and the dual channel which combines both (DC). Utilizing the results from Theorem 1 concerning the optimal channel choice for the case with deterministic demand, we find that all three of these strategies can be optimal depending on the customer’s propensity (λ) to buy from the online channel. This propensity is driven partially by customer awareness concerning the environmental impact of their product choice. When the customer’s propensity is extremely low, then the retailer should focus on their traditional retail channel (RC). When the customer’s propensity is extremely high, then the retailer should focus on their online retail channel (OC). When the customer’s propensity is of medium strength, then the retailer should focus on the dual channel strategy (DC) and can reap the benefits of higher profits due to synergy between the two channels. Furthermore, the break points which determine the optimal strategy choice are driven by the following factors: the unit costs for each channel, the environmental cost savings/premium for the online channel, the price elasticity of demand for each channel, the maximum market size, and the price substitution effects.The second question we address is, “Are there circumstances under which a retailer should focus only on online and/or traditional channels?” As mentioned in the previous paragraph, analysis in Theorem 1 from the deterministic model shows that the customer’s propensity to buy from the online channel (λ) is a crucial factor in this decision. In particular, if this parameter is extremely high or extremely low, then a single channel strategy is optimal. The numerical examples shown in Section 4 also highlight the impact of stochastic elements on this important decision. In particular, we find that a single channel strategy is more likely to be optimal when the salvage value (h) of the item sold is relatively low. In this situation, there is an increased risk associated with leftover items and consequently the region of optimality associated with the single channel strategy is slightly greater. Interestingly, we also show via the numerical results that when demand uncertainty is extremely high, then the region where a dual channel solution is optimal actually disappears. Under extreme demand uncertainty, the retailer should focus on a single channel strategy or stay out of the market altogether.The third question we address is, “How will consumer behavior evolve in response to these environmental channel concerns?” In our model, we capture consumer behavior chiefly through the variableλ, which represents the customer’s propensity to buy from the online channel. As listed in Sections 1 and 2 of our paper, evidence exists which links the consumer’s channel choice with environmental concerns. As firms start to promote the environmental impact of this alternative and as consumers become increasingly aware of the implications of this choice, then it’s likely that the consumer propensity will increase over time. Consequently, some retailers which had previously focused only on a traditional retail outlet (RC) will need to plan for a dual channel (DC) strategy. There are some notable exceptions, however, based on factors such as the population of the particular region where the traditional retailer is located and also the service levels associated with the potential online retailer (OC) channel. For example, Matthews, Williams, Tagami, and Hendrickson (2002) show that in Japan, a traditional book retailer can be more energy efficient due to the highly concentrated population.The next question posed earlier was, “Which factors associated with e-commerce have the most significant impact on the environment?” From the deterministic analysis, two main factors relevant to our model influence the environmental impact of e-commerce, including the customer propensity to buy online (λ) and the cost differential associated with each channel (e). From the numerical section, the analysis of the cost differential (e) shows that environmental cost differences can significantly shift the ranges of optimality such that the dual channel (DC) option is more prevalent. In addition, if the online channel has a smaller environmental impact such that (e<0), then the retailer should prepare for a dual channel (DC) or strictly online sales (OC) in the future. From the Numerical analysis in Section 4, we also show that the salvage value and demand uncertainty are significant determinants of the firm’s strategy.Industry specific characteristics are also important when answering the question concerning which factors have the most significant impact on the environment. Three e-commerce industries which have been studied in the past include groceries, electronics, and books. For the grocery industry, the environmental cost differential between the two channels could actually be positive (e>0) due to the refrigeration capabilities necessary for delivery. Also, the high perishability of these items is such that the salvage value (h) is fairly low. For the electronics industry, consider the study by Weber et al. (2008) which shows that the environmental impact of e-commerce is lower such thate<0. Obsolescence rates are also high in this industry due to the decrease in the price of these items and the shorter product life cycles (i.e. low h). For the book industry, the existence of secondary markets is such that the salvage value is fairly high (h). In addition, the costs of dealing with returns or remainders may actually drive the environmental differential costs (e) to favor the online channel. However, further empirical analysis is needed in each of these industries to verify the relative magnitude of these environmental factors on the channel choice.The last question posed in the introduction is, “How will policy issues such as a carbon tax impact on the retailer’s decision?” From the previous section, carbon taxes and voluntary carbon credit schemes will have the effect of amplifying the environmental differences between the two different retail channels. The industry specific characteristic relevant in this context is the environmental cost differential. as reflected via the variable e. Therefore, policy makers need consider the disparate impact on different industries for carbon tax schemes.Future topics of inquiry on e-commerce and the associated environmental impact are numerous. Our model focuses on a specific firm level decision, in particular trading off the environmental impact of online vs. traditional retail sales. While the focus of this model is on single firm decision making, there is an opportunity to consider social policy issues in the future. For example, a holistic objective which incorporates both consumer utility and firm profit could yield insights concerning the implications of these firm decisions on broader societal goals. To illustrate, both Fichter (2002) and Sui and Rejeski (2002) discuss the possibility that sales via the internet may lead to excessive consumer consumption, thereby negating some of the environmental improvements offered by this channel. Second, the model here takes into account customers who will potentially buy a single product either via a specific retailer’s traditional channel or that same retailer’s online channel. While our results still hold when the customer is buying multiple products from distinct groups, it would be interesting to analyze the impact of a budget constraint or product complimentarities on this decision. Also, the topic of showrooming has the potential to show additional synergies between the two channels. Finally, a model which explicitly addresses the impact of competition on this decision also has the potential to make an important contribution to this field. For example, how does the relative size and bargaining power of the competitive retailers influence channel distribution decisions?Claim 1For the following profit maximization problem:(31)Maximizep31;p32⩾0Π3=(p31-c1)q31+(p32-c2)q32whereq31=(1-λ)a-b1p31+sp32andq32=λa-b2p32+sp31. the optimal prices are:(32)p31∗=b2(a1+c1b1)+s(a2-sc1)2(b1b2-s2)(33)p32∗=b1(a2+c2b2)+s(a1-sc2)2(b1b2-s2)wherea1=(1-λ)a;a2=λa; andc2=c1+e+β.The first-order conditions (FOCs) for the problem stated in Eq. (31) are:(34)∂Π3∂p31=a1-b1p31+sp32-b1(p31-c1)+s(p32-c2)(35)∂Π3∂p32=a2-b2p32+sp31-b1(p32-c2)+s(p31-c1)and the second-order conditions are:(36)∂Π32∂2p31=-2b1(37)∂Π32∂2p32=-2b2(38)∂Π32∂p31∂p32=2sThese second-order conditions indicate thatΠ3is strictly and jointly concave inp31andp324This is based on observing that|H1|<0and|H2|=4(b1b2-s2)>0since it is assumed thatb1>sandb2>s.4. Hence, we can set the FOC’s in Eqs. (34) and (35) equal to 0 and determine the optimal prices by solving the following two simultaneous equations:(39)(2b1)p31+(-2s)p32=a1+b1c1-sc2(40)(-2s)p31+(2b2)p32=a2+b2c2-sc1and the result is:p31∗=b2(a1+c1b1)+s(a2-sc1)2(b1b2-s2)p32∗=b1(a2+c2b2)+s(a1-sc2)2(b1b2-s2)This proves our claim. □Theorem 1Assuming that all three strategies are feasible, the optimal strategy choice for the firm is as follows:1.If0⩽λ<(c1(b2-s)+(e+β)b2)a, the firm should choose Strategy RC (i.e., only offer the product through the retail bricks and mortar channel);If(c1(b2-s)+(e+β)b2)a⩽λ<1-(c1(b1-s)-s(e+β))a, the firm should choose strategy DC (i.e., offer the product through dual channels); andIf1-(c1(b1-s)-s(e+β))a⩽λ⩽1, the firm’s choice is the OC strategy (i.e., only offer the product through the online channel).Our proof is based on the assumption that the firm will always choose to adopt at least one of the three strategies: RC, DC, or OC. To start with, we make the following observations:•Observation 1: If bothp31∗andp1∗as defined in Table 2 are positive thenp31∗-p1∗=a1s2+b1sa22b1(b1b2-s2)>0.Observation 2: If bothp32∗andp2∗as defined in Table 2 are positive thenp32∗-p2∗=a2s1+b2sa12b2(b1b2-s2)>0.Observation 3: If bothq31∗andq1∗as defined in Table 2 are positive thenq31∗-q1∗=s(c1+e+β)2>0.Observation 4: If bothq32∗andq2∗as defined in Table 2 are positive thenq32∗-q2∗=sc12>0.Observation 5: Strategy RC is feasible if0⩽λ⩽1-c1b1asince this implies thatq1∗is non-negative.Observation 6: Strategy DC is feasible if(c1(b2-s)+(e+β)b2a⩽λ⩽1-c1(b1-s)-(e+β)sasince this implies that bothq31∗andq32∗are non-negative.Observation 7: Strategy OC is feasible if(c1+e+β)b2a⩽λ⩽1since this implies thatq2∗is non-negative.We start by assuming that this is a feasible range (i.e.,c1(b2-s)+(e+β)b2a⩾0). Then, we observe that in this range: (a) strategy DC is infeasible (Observation 6) and (b) strategy OC is infeasible (Observation 7). For the RC strategy to be feasible in this range, we need to show that(c1(b2-s)+b2(e+β))a⩽1-c1b1a. This is true provideda⩾(b1+b2-s)c1+b2(e+β)which obviously holds sincea⩾(b1+b2)c1+b2(e+β). Hence, in this range the RC is the optimal strategy.Case 2:(c1(b2-s)+(e+β)b2)a⩽λ⩽1-(c1(b1-s)-s(e+β))a.In the range, we consider three sub-cases:•(c1(b2-s)+b2(e+β))a⩽λ⩽1-c1b1a. In this range, strategies DC and RC are both feasible (strategy OC is infeasible). However, based on Observations 1 and 3, it is obvious thatΠ3∗⩾Π1∗and hence, DC is the optimal strategy.1-c1b1a⩽λ<(c1+e+β)b2a. In this range, both strategies RC and OC are infeasible and the only feasible strategy is DC (Observation 5). Hence, DC is the optimal strategy in this range.(c1+e+β)b2a⩽λ⩽1-c1(b1-s)-s(e+β)a. In this range, strategies DC and OC are both feasible (strategy RC is infeasible). However, based on Observations 2 and 4, it is obvious thatΠ3∗⩾Π2∗and hence, DC is the optimal strategy.We start by assuming that this is a feasible range (i.e.,1-c1(b1-s)-s(e+β)a⩽1). Then, we observe that in this range: (a) strategy DC is infeasible (Observation 6); and (b) strategy RC is infeasible (Observation 5). For the OC strategy to be feasible in this range, we need to show that((c1+e+β)b2)a⩽1-c1(b1-s)-s(e+β)a. This is true provideda⩾(b1+b2-s)c1+(b2-s)(e+β)which obviously holds sincea⩾(b1+b2)c1+b2(e+β). Hence, in this range the OC is the optimal strategy.This concludes our proof of Theorem 1. □Under this setting, the optimal stocking quantity for the firm for each channel setting is analogous to the market demand satisfied. Hence, the demand functions for each strategy choice (where the subscript k is product group specific) are:•For channel strategy RC:q1k(p1k)=a1k-b1kp1k;For channel strategy OC:q2k(p2k)=a2k-b2kp2k; andFor channel strategy DC:q31k(p31k,p32k)=a1k-b1kp31k+skp32kandq32k(p31k,p32k)=a2k-b2kp32k+skp31k.Under each strategy choice, the firm solves the following profit maximization problems:•For strategy choice RC(41)Maximizep1k⩾0Π1=∑k=12[p1k-c1k]q1k(p1k)For strategy choice OC(42)Maximizep2k⩾0Π2=∑k=12[p2k-c1k-ek-βk]q2k(p2k)For strategy choice DC(43)Maximizep31k;p32k⩾0Π3=∑k=12[p31k-c1]q31k(p31k,p32k)+[p32k-c1k-ek-βk]q32k(p31k,p32k)Claim 2Assuming that a dual channel (DC) strategy is optimal, then the optimal price for RC (p2U∗) will increase in response to the following:1.An increase in the maximum market size a.A decrease in the environmental propensity of customersλ.A decrease in the price sensitivity to demand for the RC channelb1.A decrease in the price sensitivity to demand for the OC channelb2.An increase in the symmetric price based substitution effects parameter s.An increase in the unit cost for the RC channelc1.Assuming that a dual channel (DC) strategy is optimal, then the optimal price for OC (p32U∗) will increase in response to the following:1.An increase in the maximum market size a.An increase in the environmental propensity of customersλ.A decrease in the price sensitivity to demand for the RC channelb1.A decrease in the price sensitivity to demand for the OC channelb2.An increase in the symmetric price based substitution effects parameter s.An increase in the cost premium for the OC channel e.The optimal prices for the dual channel stochastic model are as follows:(44)p31U*(z1,z2)=b2u1+su22(b1b2-s2)(45)p32U*(z1,z2)=b1u2+su12(b1b2-s2)whereu1=(a1+b1c1)-g(z1,d1)-sc2+μ1,u2=(a2+b2c2)-g(z2,d2)-sc1+μ2,g(z1,d1)=∫z1d1(∊1-z1)f(∊1)d∊1andg(z2,d2)=∫z2d2(∊2-z2)f(∊2)d∊2.Analyzingg(z1,d1)further, we find thatg(z1,d1)=∫z1d1(∊1-z1)f(∊1)d∊1=∫z1d1(∊1)f(∊1)d∊1-z1∫z1d1f(∊1)d∊1. In this expression, we find that∫z1d1(∊1)f(∊1)d∊1⩽μ1,0⩽∫z1d1f(∊1)d∊1⩽1, and-d1⩽z1⩽d1. Sinced1⩽a1, theng(z1,d1)⩽μ1+a1.Taking the derivative ofp31U∗with respect to various parameters, we find that(46)∂p31U∂a=b2(1-λ)+λs)2(b1b2-s2)⩾0(47)∂p31U∂λ=-a(b2-s)2(b1b2-s2)⩽0(48)∂p31U∂b1=-b2[b2(a1+μ1-g(z1,d1))+s(a2+mu2-g(z2,d2))]2(b1b2-s2)2⩽0(49)∂p31U∂b2=-s[s(a1+μ1-g(z1,d1))+b1(a2+mu2-g(z2,d2))]2(b1b2-s2)2⩽0(50)∂p31U∂s=2b2s(a1+μ1-g(z1,d1))+(b1b2+s2)(a2+mu2-g(z2,d2))2(b1b2-s2)2⩾0(51)∂p31U∂c1=12⩾0(52)∂p31U∂c2=0The results forp32U∗are similar to those forp31U∗and are omitted.□
