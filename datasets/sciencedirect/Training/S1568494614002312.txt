@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article investigates new score and accuracy functions for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). The novelty of these functions is that they allow the comparison of IVIFNs by taking into account of the decision makers’ attitudinal character. The new attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions extend Xu and Chen's score and accuracy degree functions, and verify the following set of properties: (1) boundedness; (2) monotonicity; (3) commutativity; and (4) symmetry. These novel functions are used to propose a total order on the set of IVIFNs, and to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision making selection process in which the final result depends on the decision maker's risk attitude. In addition, a ranking sensitivity analysis with respect to the risk attitude is provided.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Atanassov [1] introduced the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which is characterised by both the membership and non-membership functions and therefore it generalises the concept of fuzzy set [2,3]. Subsequently, Atanassov and Gargov [4] extended IFSs with the introduction of the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs). The notions of IFSs and IVIFSs are interesting and very useful in modelling real life problems with imprecision or uncertainty and they have been applied to many different fields, including multiple attribute decision making (MADM) [5–9], group decision making (GDM) [10–12], supplier selection [13,14], robot selection [15] and artificial intelligence [16].The first step of any MADM process with information modelled using IFSs is to fuse the intuitionistic fuzzy assessment values of the different attributes into a collective intuitionistic fuzzy assessment via an appropriate aggregation operator [17]. Once this step has been completed, the aggregated intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are compared to produce a final ranking of the alternatives. Consequently, an active research topic is the investigation of intuitionistic fuzzy MADM that includes suitable and valid intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators. Since Xu [18] developed the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator, extensive research work has been carried out to develop aggregation operators for both IFSs and/or IVIFSs (see for example [19–21]). However, the above cited intuitionistic fuzzy operators are based on additive measures and are not suitable to aggregate inter-dependent criteria. To resolve this issue, Tan and Chen [22,23] proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator and the generalised interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator for multi-attribute interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making problems.Another active research topic regards the development of score degree and accuracy degree functions to make possible the comparison of criterion values that are expressed by IFSs and IVIFSs, respectively. A comprehensive comparative analysis of existing score degree and accuracy degree functions to date can be found in [24]. Chen and Tan in [25] developed a score degree function for IFSs based on the membership degree and non-membership degree functions, which was later improved by Hong and Choi in [26] with the addition of an accuracy degree function. In addition, Hong and Choi argued about the similarity between the role of the score degree and the accuracy degree functions of IFSs and that of the mean and the variance in statistics. Subsequently, other improved score degree and accuracy degree functions have been proposed in [27–32]. Also these functions are extended to the cases of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers [33,34] and intuitionistic linguistic numbers [35–37]. It is worth mentioning the score degree and accuracy degree functions recently developed by Xu and Chen in [38] to propose an order relation on the set of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). However, as it will be proved later with a counter-example (Example 1), the order relation derived from the application of Xu and Chen's score degree and accuracy degree functions is not total. In a attempt to resolve this drawback, Ye in [39] and Lakshmana Gomathi Nayagam and Sivaraman in [40] proposed alternative accuracy degree functions, respectively, which they claimed produced a total ordering of IVIFNs. However, these alternative degree functions are not superior to the existing accuracy degree functions but equivalent ‘the course of comparing any two interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers’. As it will be shown later in section ‘Ordering relation of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers’, these score degree and accuracy degree functions do not capture well all the information contained in IVIFNs and consequently can lead to a lack of precision in the final ordering of IVIFNs. We believe that this is because these functions are simple and straight forward extensions of their respective proposals for the case of IFNs. An important limitation of the above approaches resides in the fact that they do not take into account the attitudinal character of decision makers. Yager in [41] pointed out that the attitudinal character of each decision maker may affect the final ranking order of fuzzy numbers (FNs). The problem of ordering FNs, though, has been extensively studied and an agreed conclusion is that there is no unique best approach to do this. Recall that FNs are particular cases of IVIFNs. Thus, the same conclusion applies to IVIFNs. Therefore, it is important to develop a methodology that best captures the decision maker's risk attitude regarding the ranking IVIFNs.In order to achieve this, the the remainder of this paper is organised as follows: The next section briefly reviews the main score degree and accuracy degree functions of IVIFSs and an analysis of their relationships as well as their associated drawbacks is carried out, which it is used in section ‘The risk attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions’ to support the development of novel attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions of IVIFNs driven by the decision maker's attitudinal character. In this section, it is also proved that the new attitudinal expected functions extend Xu and Chen's score degree and accuracy degree functions. The following desirable properties are proved to be satisfied by the new attitudinal expected functions: (i) boundedness; (ii) monotonicity; (iii) commutativity; and (iv) symmetry. This section is completed with the definition of a total order relation on the set of IVIFNs. Section ‘Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making method based on the attitudinal expected functions’ presents a sensitivity analysis with respect to the attitudinal character and a resolution process of MADM problems in an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, in section ‘Conclusion’ conclusions are drawn and suggestions made for further work.This section presents the key concepts related to IVIFSs that will be used throughout this paper. First, we present Atanassov and Gargov's definition of the notion of IVIFS, which is characterised by a membership function and a non-membership function that take interval numbers rather than crisp numbers, as introduced in [4].Definition 1Interval-valued IFS (IVIFS)Let INT([0, 1]) be the set of all closed subintervals of the unit interval and X be a universe of discourse. An interval-valued IFS (IVIFS) A over X is given as:(1)A=〈x,μ˜A(x),ν˜A(x)〉|x∈Xwhereμ˜A(x),ν˜A(x)∈INT([0,1]), represent the membership and the non-membership degrees of the element x to the set A subject to the following constraint0≤supμ˜A(x)+supν˜A(x)≤1,∀x∈X.Denoting byμ˜AL(x),μ˜AU(x),ν˜AL(x)andν˜AU(x)the lower and upper end points ofμ˜A(x)andν˜A(x), respectively, an IVIFS can be represented as(2)A=〈x,[μ˜AL(x),μ˜AU(x)],[ν˜AL(x),ν˜AU(x)]〉|x∈X:0≤μ˜AU(x)+ν˜AU(x)≤1,μ˜AL(x)∧ν˜AL(x)≥0Recall that given two IVIFSs, A and B, Atanassov and Gargov containment concept is modelled as follows [4]:A⊆Biff∀x∈X:μ˜AL(x)≤μ˜BL(x)∧μ˜AU(x)≤μ˜BU(x)∧ν˜AL(x)≥ν˜BL(x)∧ν˜AU(x)≥ν˜BU(x).The hesitancy degree function of an IVIFS is:(3)π˜A(x)=[1−μ˜AU(x)−ν˜AU(x),1−μ˜AL(x)−ν˜AL(x)].Given x∈X,([μ˜AL(x),μ˜AU(x)],[ν˜AL(x),ν˜AU(x)])will be referred to as an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN). For convenience, an IVIFN will be denoted by ([μ−, μ+], [ν−, ν+]).Given two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we have the following definition of containment [4]:α˜1⊆α˜2iffμ1−≤μ2−,μ1+≤μ2+,ν1−≥ν2−,andν1+≥ν2+.Also, the main arithmetic operations can be expressed in terms of the interval lower and upper bounds as follows [1,42]:(1)α˜¯1=([ν1−,ν1+],[μ1−,μ1+])α˜1⊕α˜2=([μ1−+μ2−−μ1−·μ2−,μ1++μ2+−μ1+·μ2+],[ν1−·ν2−,ν1+·ν2+])α˜1⊗α˜2=([μ1−·μ2−,μ1+·μ2+],[ν1−+ν2−−ν1−·ν2−,ν1++ν2+−ν1+·ν2+])λ·α˜1=([1−(1−μ1−)λ,1−(1−μ1+)λ],[(ν1−)λ,(ν1+)λ])α˜1λ=([(μ1−)λ,(μ1+)λ],[1−(1−ν1−)λ,1−(1−ν1+)λ])The score degree and accuracy degree functions play a key role in MADM problems with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information because they allow the comparison of criteria values using IVIFNs. For IVIFNs, Xu and Chen proposed in [38] the following score degree and accuracy degree functions:Definition 2Xu and Chen's IVIFN score and accuracy functions [38]Letα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+])be an IVIFN. The score degree and accuracy degree functions ofα˜are represented, respectively, by(4)S˜XC(α˜)=μ−+μ+−ν−−ν+2and(5)A˜XC(α˜)=μ−+μ++ν−+ν+2.Notice thatSXC(α˜)∈[−1,1], whileAXC(α˜)∈[0,1], and that both functions are related as follows:(6)AXC(α˜)=SXC(α˜)+(ν−+ν+).Thus, the following result is proved:Proposition 1Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), the following inequality holds:S˜XC(α˜)≤A˜XC(α˜)The score degree function is monotonic increasing with respect to the containment relation of IVIFNs are the following result proves:Proposition 2Given two IVIFNsα˜1andα˜2such thatα˜1⊆α˜2then it isS˜XC(α˜1)≤S˜XC(α˜2).Recall thatα˜1⊆α˜2is equivalent toμ1−≤μ2−,μ1+≤μ2+,ν1−≥ν2−,ν1+≥ν2+. Therefore it isμ1−+μ1+−ν1−−ν1+≤μ2−+μ2+−ν2−−ν2+.□The score degree and accuracy degree are used by Xu and Chen to propose the following IVIFNs two level ranking method:Definition 3Xu and Chen's IVIFNs order relation [38]Given two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), the following ordering relation can be established:(1)IfS˜XC(α˜1)<S˜XC(α˜2)thenα˜1<α˜2.IfS˜XC(α˜1)=S˜XC(α˜2):(i)IfA˜XC(α˜1)<A˜XC(α˜2)thenα˜1<α˜2.IfA˜XC(α˜1)=A˜XC(α˜2)thenα˜1=α˜2.In the first level, the score degree is used to rank the IVIFNs, and the second level is only applied when two IVIFNs have same score degrees, in which case their accuracy degrees are used to discern the order relation between the IVIFSs. Two IVIFSs are considered equivalent in term of ordering when both have same score degree and accuracy degree.Ye in [39] proposed an alternative expression for the accuracy degree function of an IVIFN to Xu and Chen's accuracy degree function, but with same range of values, [−1, 1]:Definition 4Ye's IVIFN accuracy function [39]The accuracy degree function of an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+])can be represented by(7)A˜Y(α˜)=μ−+μ++ν−+ν+2−1Notice that in the above definitions, the hesitancy degree function of IVIFNs is not implemented, which is not the case in the following accuracy degree function introduced by Lakshmana and Sivaraman in [40]:Definition 5Lakshmana and Sivaraman's IVIFN accuracy function [40]The hesitancy based accuracy degree function of an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+])can be represented by(8)A˜LSδ(α˜)=membership degree+δ·(hesitancy degree)2i.e.(9)A˜LSδ(α˜)=μ−+μ++δ·(2−μ−−μ+−ν−−ν+)2where δ∈[0, 1] is a parameter that is used to control the individual's intentions as follows: δ=1 corresponds to an optimistic individual, while a pessimistic one would have a value of δ=0.An alternative expression forA˜LSδ(α˜)is:(10)A˜LSδ(α˜)=1−δ2·(μ−+μ+)−δ2·(ν−+ν+)+δ.Using expression (10), it is easy to prove that Lakshmana and Sivaraman's accuracy function is monotonic increasing with respect to the containment relation of IVIFNs:Proposition 3Given two IVIFNsα˜1andα˜2such thatα˜1⊆α˜2, then it isA˜LSδ(α˜1)≤A˜LSδ(α˜2).Notice thatA˜Y(α˜)andA˜LSδ(α˜)can be re-written as follows:A˜Y(α˜)=S˜XC(α˜)+32·A˜XC(α˜)−1A˜LSδ(α˜1)=12·S˜XC(α˜)+1−2·δ2·A˜XC(α˜)+δ.The following relationships between the above score degree and accuracy degree functions are established:Proposition 4The IVIFN accuracy degree functionA˜LSδand the score degree function SXCare related as follows:(11)A˜LS0.5(α˜)=12·S˜XC(α˜)+12and therefore are equivalent in the ordering IVIFNs.Proposition 5Given any two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we have:1IfS˜XC(α˜1)=S˜XC(α˜2)andA˜XC(α˜1)=A˜XC(α˜2)then(1.a)A˜Y(α˜1)=A˜Y(α˜2).A˜LSδ(α˜1)=A˜LSδ(α˜2).IfS˜XC(α˜1)=S˜XC(α˜2)andA˜XC(α˜1)<A˜XC(α˜2)then(2.a)A˜Y(α˜1)<A˜Y(α˜2).A˜LSδ(α˜1)<A˜LSδ(α˜2)when δ<0.5.A˜LSδ(α˜1)=A˜LSδ(α˜2)when δ=0.5.A˜LSδ(α˜1)>A˜LSδ(α˜2)when δ>0.5.As mentioned before, the score degree and accuracy degree functions are widely used in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MADM problems to produce a final ranking of alternatives. However, as the following example illustrates, they are unable to discriminate between all pairs of IVIFNs in terms of ranking:Example 1The following two IVIFNsα˜1=([0.15,0.35],[0.2,0.4])andα˜2=([0.2,0.3],[0.2,0.35])have the same score valueS˜XC(α˜1)=S˜XC(α˜2)=−0.05, and therefore the accuracy value is to be used to rank them. However, in this case we haveA˜XC(α˜1)=A˜XC(α˜2)=0.55. From expressions (7) and (9), and in accordance to Proposition 5, we haveA˜Y(α˜1)=A˜Y(α˜1)=−0.025andA˜LSδ(α˜1)=A˜LSδ(α˜2)=0.25+0.45·δ, respectively.The example above manifests that the application of the reviewed score degree and accuracy degree functions are unable to make a clear decision between two alternatives with final evaluation represented with apparently different IVIFNs, as they treat them as equal in terms of ordering. This drawback could be overcome by implementing the score degree and accuracy degree functions taking into account of the decision maker's risk attitude, as proposed in the following section.Yager [41] pointed out that the comparison of FNs is a problem that has been extensively studied and that there is no unique best approach. Indeed, the set of fuzzy numbers is not totally ordered, and therefore a widely used approach to rank FNs consists in converting them into a representative crisp value, and perform the comparison on them [41,43], a methodology originally proposed by Zadeh in [44]. Recently, a study by Brunelli and Mezei [45] that compares different ranking methods for fuzzy numbers concludes that ‘it is impossible to give a final answer to the question on what ranking method is the best. Most of the time choosing a method rather than another is a matter of preference or is context dependent.’ Recall that FNs are particular cases of IVIFNs. Thus, the same conclusion applies to IVIFNs. In any case, it seems appropriate to take into account the decision maker's risk attitude to derive a final solution to the MADM problem. In the following, we propose the risk attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions for IVIFNs, which extend the functions reviewed in section ‘Preliminaries’.In the following, an interval valued score function for IVIFNs is introduced and a novel expected score function that takes into account the decision maker's attitude via the application of the concept of attitudinal character of a BUM and the continuous ordered weighted average (COWA) operator introduced by Yager [41]. A set of properties of the attitudinal expected score function is also proved. To do this, we start by recalling the concept of a basic unit-monotonic (BUM) function [46]:Definition 6BUM functionA function Q:[0, 1]→[0, 1] such that Q(0)=0, Q(1)=1 and Q(x)≥Q(y) if x≥y is called a basic unit-monotonic (BUM) functionGiven a BUM function, Q, Yager proposed the following definition of the COWA operators [41]:Definition 7COWA operatorLetINT(ℝ)be the set of all closed subintervals ofℝ. A continuous ordered weighted average (COWA) operator is a mappingFQ:INT(ℝ)→ℝwhich has an associated BUM function, Q, such that(12)FQ[a,b]=(1−λ)·a+λ·b.where(13)λ=∫01Q(y)dy.is the attitudinal character of Q. Thus,FQ[a,b]is the weighted average of the end points of the closed interval with attitudinal character parameter λ, and it is known as the attitudinal expected value of [a, b].In the following, an interval-valued score function is proposed for IVIFNs to derive, after the application of expression (12), the new attitudinal expected score function to be applied in the resolution of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy MADM problems:Definition 8IVIFN interval-valued score functionLet INT([−1, 1]) be the set of all closed subintervals of [−1, 1]. The interval-valued score function associated to an IVIFNα˜(x)=([μ−(x),μ+(x)],[ν−(x),ν+(x)])is given as follows:S˜WC(α˜):X⟶INT([−1,1]),(14)S˜WC(α˜)(x)=[μ−(x),μ+(x)]−[ν−(x),ν+(x)]=[μ−(x)−ν+(x),μ+(x)−ν−(x)]As it was done before, we will drop the symbol x when referring to the interval-valued score function of an IVIFNα˜, and it will be denoted simply asS˜WC(α˜)=[μ−−ν+,μ+−ν−].Definition 9IVIFN attitudinal expected score functionThe attitudinal expected score function associated to an IVIFNα˜,S˜WCis(15)ES˜WC(α˜)λ=(1−λ)·(μ−−ν+)+λ·(μ+−ν−)where λ is the attitudinal character of a BUM function Q.Notice that because the attitudinal expected score function is based on the COWA operator, some of the properties of this last one are expected to be inherited by the former one. In the following, we provide such set of properties.The attitudinal expected score function is monotonic with respect to the containment relation of IVIFNs:Proposition 6Given any two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), such thatα˜1⊆α˜2thenES˜WC(α˜1)λ≤ES˜WC(α˜2)λ.According to Definition 9, we haveES˜WC(α˜1)λ−ES˜WC(α˜2)λ=(1−λ)·[(μ1−−ν1+)−(μ2−−ν2+)]+λ·[(μ1+−ν1−)−(μ2+−ν2−)]Becauseα˜1⊆α˜2then it isμ1−≤μ2−,μ1+≤μ2+,ν1−≥ν2−,andν1+≥ν2+, and thereforeμ1−−ν1+≤μ2−−ν2+∧μ1+−ν1−≤μ2+−ν2−.Thus, we conclude:ES˜WC(α˜1)λ−ES˜WC(α˜2)λ≤0.□Notice that fixing an IVIFNα˜the attitudinal expected score function can be consider a function of the attitudinal character λ, of which it exhibits the following type of monotonicity property.Proposition 7Given an IVIFN,α˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), the attitudinal expected score functionES˜WC(α˜)λis monotonic with respect to the argument λ, i.e.λ1≥λ2⇒ES˜WC(α˜)λ1≥ES˜WC(α˜)λ2.Notice thatES˜WC(α˜)λcan be re-written as followsES˜WC(α˜)λ=(μ−−ν+)+λ·(μ+−μ−+ν+−ν−)Because μ+−μ−+ν+−ν−≥0 it is obvious thatES˜WC(α˜)λis increasing with respect to λ.   □The attitudinal expected score function is also bounded.Proposition 8Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), we have−1≤μ−−ν+≤ES˜WC(α˜)λ≤μ+−ν−≤1.From Proposition 7 we know that the minimum and maximum values ofES˜WC(α˜)λare obtained for λ=0 and λ=1, respectively. We have:ES˜WC(α˜)0=μ−−ν+ES˜WC(α˜)1=μ+−ν−This completes the proof.   □From the results of the preceding theorems, we see that the attitudinal expected score function is a mean operator. The following result proves that the attitudinal expected score function is additive and therefore it is a weighted averaging operator.Proposition 9Given any two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we haveES˜WC(α˜1)+S˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜1)λ+ES˜WC(α˜2)λBecauseS˜WC(α˜1)+S˜WC(α˜2)=[(μ1−−ν1+)+(μ2−−ν2+),(μ1+−ν1−)+(μ2+−ν2−)]then it isES˜WC(α˜1)+S˜WC(α˜2)λ=(1−λ)·(μ1−−ν1+)+(μ2−−ν2+)+λ·(μ1+−ν1−)+(μ2+−ν2−).Re-arranging the right-hand side we haveES˜WC(α˜1)+S˜WC(α˜2)λ=(1−λ)·(μ1−−ν1+)+λ·(μ1+−ν1−)+(1−λ)·(μ2−−ν2+)+λ·(μ2+−ν2−)Thus:ES˜WC(α˜1)+S˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜1)λ+ES˜WC(α˜2)λ.□The attitudinal expected score function generalises Xu and Chen's score function as the following result proves:Proposition 10The IVIFN score functionS˜XCand the IVIFN attitudinal expected score functionES˜WC(α˜)λare related as follows(16)ES˜WC(α˜)0.5=S˜XC(α˜).When λ=0.5 the expression ofES˜WC(α˜)λreduces toES˜WC(α˜)0.5=12·(μ−−ν+)+12·(μ+−ν−)=μ−+μ−−ν−−ν−2=S˜XC(α˜).□In the following we will provide a sensitivity analysis of the attitudinal expected score function with respect to the attitudinal character λ, i.e. we will provide the conditions under which the ordering of two IVIFNs is not affected by a change in the attitudinal parameter.Theorem 1Letα˜i=([μi−,μi+],[νi−,νi+])andα˜j=([μj−,μj+],[νj−,νj+])be two IVIFNs, and let λ be the attitudinal parameter associated to BUM function Q under which it has been established thatES˜WC(α˜i)λ≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λ.Let Δλ be a perturbation of the attitudinal character λ with 0≤λ+Δλ≤ 1. Then we haveES˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λ+Δλiffmax−λ,ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifβi<βj−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifβj=βi−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj,ifβi>βjwhereβi=μi+−μi−+νi+−νi−andβj=μj+−μj−+νj+−νj−.ProofFirstly, we note that Δλ is subject to the following constraint:−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ.We have the following relation betweenES˜WC(α˜i)λ+ΔλandES˜WC(α˜i)λ:ES˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ=ES˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ·βiwhereβi=μi+−μi−+νi+−νi−. The following equivalence holds:(17)ES˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λ+Δλ⇔Δλ·(βi−βj)≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λThree scenarios are possible:•βi=βj. BecauseES˜WC(α˜i)λ≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λthen (17) is true for any value of Δλ, i.e.−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ.βi>βj⇔Δλ≤ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj, and therefore:−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj.βi<βj⇔Δλ≥ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj, and therefore:max−λ,ES˜WC(α˜j)λ−ES˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj≤Δλ≤1−λ.Following the methodology of section ‘The attitudinal expected function and its properties’, an interval valued accuracy function for IVIFNs and a novel expected accuracy function that takes into account the decision maker's attitude are introduced.Definition 10IVIFN interval-valued accuracy functionLet INT([0, 1]) be the set of all closed subintervals of [0, 1]. The interval-valued accuracy function associated to an IVIFN,α˜(x)=([μ−(x),μ+(x)],[ν−(x),ν+(x)])is given as followsA˜WC(α˜):X⟶INT([0,1]),(18)A˜WC(α˜)(x)=[μ−(x),μ+(x)]+[ν−(x),ν+(x)]=[μ−(x)+ν−(x),μ+(x)+ν+(x)]Again, we will drop the symbol x when referring to the interval-valued accuracy function of an IVIFNα˜, and it will be denoted simply asA˜WC(α˜)=[μ−+ν−,μ++ν+].Definition 11IVIFN attitudinal expected accuracy functionThe attitudinal expected accuracy function associated to an IVIFNα˜,A˜WCis(19)EA˜WC(α˜)λ=(1−λ)·(μ−+ν−)+λ·(μ++ν+)where λ is the attitudinal character of a BUM function Q.As with the attitudinal expected score function, the attitudinal expected accuracy function verifies some kind of monotonicity property with respect to the IVIFN argument.Proposition 11Given two IVIFNs,α˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), such thatμ1−+ν1−≤μ2−+ν2−∧μ1++ν1+≤μ2++ν2+thenEA˜WC(α˜1)λ≤EA˜WC(α˜2)λ.Obvious.  □In Proposition 11, it is sufficient thatμ1−≤μ2−,ν1−≤ν2−,μ1+≤μ2+andν1+≤ν2+to ensure thatEA˜WC(α˜1)λ≤EA˜WC(α˜2)λis true.Notice thatEA˜WC(α˜)λcan be re-written as follows:(20)EA˜WC(α˜)λ=(μ−+ν−)+λ·(μ+−μ−+ν+−ν−)=ES˜WC(α˜)λ+(ν++ν−).Therefore, the following relationship between the attitudinal expected accuracy score function and the attitudinal expected accuracy function is proved:Proposition 12Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), the following holds:(21)ES˜WC(α˜)λ≤EA˜WC(α˜)λAn immediate consequence of expression (20) is that the attitudinal expected score function properties of monotonicity with respect to the argument λ, boundedness and additivity are also verified by the attitudinal expected accuracy function.Proposition 13Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), the attitudinal expected accuarcy functionEA˜WC(α˜)λis monotonic with respect to the argument λ, i.e.λ1≥λ2⇒EA˜WC(α˜)λ1≥EA˜WC(α˜)λ2.Proposition 14Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), we have0≤μ−+ν−≤EA˜WC(α˜)λ≤μ++ν+≤1.Proposition 15Given any two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we haveEA˜WC(α˜1)+A˜WC(α˜2)λ=EA˜WC(α˜1)λ+EA˜WC(α˜2)λAdditionally, the attitudinal expected accuracy function verifies a type of symmetry property with respect to the interval-valued membership and non-membership degrees of the IVIFN argument.Proposition 16Given an IVIFNα˜=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+]), we haveEA˜WC(α˜)λ=EA˜WC(α˜¯)λRecall thatα˜¯=([ν−,ν+],[μ−,μ+]), therefore we haveEA˜WC(α˜¯)λ=(1−λ)·(ν−+μ−)+λ·(ν++μ+).This expression coincides with (19).   □As it happened before with the attitudinal expected score function and Xu and Chen's score function, we have the following result that proves that the attitudinal expected accuracy function extends Xu and Chen's accuracy function:Proposition 17The IVIFN accuracy functionA˜XCand the IVIFN attitudinal expected accuracy functionEA˜WC(α˜)λare related as follows(22)EA˜WC(α˜)0.5=A˜XC(α˜).We observe that Proposition 5 applies toES˜WC(α˜)λandEA˜WC(α˜)λwhen λ=0.5.The attitudinal expected accuracy functionsEA˜WC(α˜i)λ+ΔλandEA˜WC(α˜i)λare related as follows:EA˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ=EA˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ·βiwhereβi=μi+−μi−+νi+−νi−. Therefore, the proof of Theorem 1 is applicable to prove the following result regarding the sensitivity analysis of the attitudinal expected accuracy function with respect to the attitudinal parameter λ:Theorem 2Letα˜i=([μi−,μi+],[νi−,νi+])andα˜j=([μj−,μj+],[νj−,νj+])be two IVIFNs, and let λ be the attitudinal parameter associated to BUM function Q under which it has been established thatEA˜WC(α˜i)λ≤EA˜WC(α˜j)λ.Let Δλ be a perturbation of the attitudinal character λ with 0≤λ+Δλ≤ 1. Then we haveEA˜WC(α˜i)λ+Δλ≤EA˜WC(α˜j)λ+Δλiffmax−λ,EA˜WC(α˜j)λ−EA˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifβi<βj−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifβj=βi−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,EA˜WC(α˜j)λ−EA˜WC(α˜i)λβi−βj,ifβi>βjwhereβi=μi+−μi−+νi+−νi−andβj=μj+−μj−+νj+−νj−.Example 1 demonstrates that a two level ordering relation based on the score function and accuracy function developed up to know is insufficient to discriminate correctly between different IVIFNs. The reason for this is that an IVIFN is completely characterised by four parameters in the unit interval subject to a constraint on two of the parameters (the upper membership and non-membership degrees) that reduces the degrees of freedom from four to three. Therefore, it seems as if a three level ordering relation might be needed to accurately identified equality of IVIFNs, and therefore to properly discriminate between different IVIFNs. To achieve this, a new index function is used in conjunction with the attitudinal expected score function and the attitudinal expected accuracy function previously developed, which was introduced by Wang et al. in [31] and that is presented in the following definition:Definition 12Membership uncertainty index functionThe membership uncertainty index function of an IVIFN,α˜(x)=([μ−(x),μ+(x)],[ν−(x),ν+(x)])is given as followsT(α˜):X⟶[−1,1],(23)T(α˜)(x)=μ+(x)−μ−(x)−ν+(x)−ν−(x)For simplicity and consistency with the previous defined functions, we will drop the symbol x when referring to the membership uncertainty index function of an IVIFNα˜, and it will be denoted simply asT(α˜)=μ+−μ−−ν+−ν−.Atanassov and Gargov's defintion of equality of IVIFNs is the following [4]:Definition 13Equality of IVIFNsGiven two IVIFNs,α˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we have the following equivalence:(24)α˜1=α˜2⇔μ1−=μ2−∧μ1+=μ2+∧ν1−=ν2−∧ν1+=ν2+Next, we characterise the equality of IVIFNs using the above three functions:Proposition 18Characterisation of equality of IVIFNsGiven two IVIFNs,α˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), we have the following equivalence:α˜1=α˜2iffES˜WC(α1˜)λ=ES˜WC(α2˜)λ∧EA˜WC(α1˜)λ=EA˜WC(α2˜)λ∧Tα1˜=Tα2˜We only need to prove that whenES˜WC(α1˜)λ=ES˜WC(α2˜)λ∧EA˜WC(α1˜)λ=EA˜WC(α2˜)λ∧Tα1˜=Tα2˜then it isμ1−=μ2−∧μ1+=μ2+∧ν1−=ν2−∧ν1+=ν2+.1ES˜WC(α1˜)λ=ES˜WC(α2˜)λis equivalent to(1−λ)·(μ1−−ν1+)+λ·(μ1+−ν1−)=(1−λ)·(μ2−−ν2+)+λ·(μ2+−ν2−),∀λ∈[0,1].Making λ=0 and λ=1 we have:(a)μ1−−ν1+=μ2−−ν2+μ1+−ν1−=μ2+−ν2−EA˜WC(α1˜)λ=EA˜WC(α2˜)λis equivalent to(1−λ)·(μ1−+ν1−)+λ·(μ1++ν1+)=(1−λ)·(μ2−+ν2−)+λ·(μ2++ν2+),∀λ∈[0,1].Making λ=0 and λ=1 we have:(a)μ1−+ν1−=μ2−+ν2−μ1++ν1+=μ2++ν2+Tα1˜=Tα2˜is equivalent toμ1+−μ1−−ν1+−ν1−=μ2+−μ2−−ν2+−ν2−The following expression is computed2·1(a)+2(a)+2(b)−3resulting in4·μ1−=4·μ2−⇔μ1−=μ2−.Applying this to 1(a) and 2(a) we have thatν1+=ν2+andν1−=ν2−, respectively. Finally, from 1(b) we derive thatμ1+=μ2+.   □This result allows the development of the following order relation on the set of IVIFNs:Definition 14Attitudinal IVIFN order relationGiven two IVIFNs,α˜1andα˜2, we say thatα˜1≺α˜2if and only if one the following conditions is true:1ES˜WC(α1˜)λ<ES˜WC(α2˜)λES˜WC(α1˜)λ=ES˜WC(α2˜)λ∧EA˜WC(α1˜)λ<EA˜WC(α2˜)λES˜WC(α1˜)λ=ES˜WC(α2˜)λ∧EA˜WC(α1˜)λ=EA˜WC(α2˜)λ∧Tα1˜>Tα2˜The next result proves that the order relation ≺ is a strict order.Theorem 3Strict orderThe relation ≺ on the set of IVIFNs is a strict order, i.e. ≺ is1Irreflexive:∀α˜:α˜≺α˜does not hold.Asymmetric:∀α˜1,α˜2:ifα˜1≺α˜2, thenα˜2≺α˜2does not hold.Transitive:∀α˜1,α˜2,α˜3:ifα˜1≺α˜2andα˜2≺α˜3, thenα˜1≺α˜3.Items 1. and 2. are obvious from Definition 14. We prove the transitivity property. Starting withα˜1≺α˜2, from Definition 14 we have three possible cases:1ES˜WC(α˜1)λ<ES˜WC(α˜2)λ. In this case, it is clear thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ<ES˜WC(α˜3)λ, no matter which condition is true forα˜2≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜2)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ<EA˜WC(α˜2)λ. Becauseα˜2≺α˜3then one of the following is true:(a)ES˜WC(α˜2)λ<ES˜WC(α˜3)λ. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ<ES˜WC(α˜3)λand therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜2)λ<EA˜WC(α˜3)λ. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ<EA˜WC(α˜3)λand therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜2)λ=EA˜WC(α˜3)λ∧Tα˜2>Tα˜3. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ<EA˜WC(α˜3)λand therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜2)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ=EA˜WC(α˜2)λ∧Tα˜1>Tα˜2. Becauseα˜2≺α˜3then one of the following is true:(a)ES˜WC(α˜2)λ<ES˜WC(α˜3)λ. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ<ES˜WC(α˜3)λand therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜2)λ<EA˜WC(α˜3)λ. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ<EA˜WC(α˜3)λand therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.ES˜WC(α˜2)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜2)λ=EA˜WC(α˜3)λ∧Tα˜2>Tα˜3. In this case, we conclude thatES˜WC(α˜1)λ=ES˜WC(α˜3)λ∧EA˜WC(α˜1)λ=EA˜WC(α˜3)λ∧Tα˜1>Tα˜3and therefore it isα˜1≺α˜3.Theorem 3 allows the following construction of a total order on the set of IVIFNs:(25)α˜1⪯α˜2if and only ifα˜1≺α˜2∨α˜1=α˜2.Proposition 6 can be re-written as follows:Proposition 19Given any two IVIFNsα˜1=([μ1−,μ1+],[ν1−,ν1+])andα˜2=([μ2−,μ2+],[ν2−,ν2+]), the following holds:α˜1⊆α˜2⇒α˜1⪯α˜2.Notice that the results presented in this section are applicable to constant IVIFNs, i.e. IVIFNs verifying([μ˜AL(x),μ˜AU(x)],[ν˜AL(x),ν˜AU(x)])=([μ−,μ+],[ν−,ν+])∀x∈X.Let A={A1, A2, …, Am} be a set of alternatives and a set of criteria C={C1, C2, …, Cn} that have associated an importance weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)such that:wj≥0∧∑j=1nwj=1.Each alternative Aiis assessed using the following assessment profile of constant IVIFNs on the set of criteria(26)∀i∈{1,2,…,m}:Ai=〈Cj,[μ˜iL(Cj),μ˜iU(Cj)],[ν˜iL(Cj),ν˜iU(Cj)]〉|∀j∈{1,2,…,n}:Cj∈C:0≤μ˜iU(Cj)+ν˜iU(Cj)≤1,μ˜iL(Cj)∧ν˜iL(Cj)≥0Using the following notation from the previous section[μ˜iL(Cj),μ˜iU(Cj)],[ν˜iL(Cj),ν˜iU(Cj)]=([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+])=α˜ijAn interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix,D˜=(α˜ij)m×n, is elicited. The problem here to solve is to produce a final ranking of the alternatives based on the information contained in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix.Example 2Let us assume a set of four alternatives {A1, A2, A3, A4} that are assessed against a set of four criteria {C1, C2, C3, C4}, with corresponding weighting vector W=(0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1), resulting in the following interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix.D˜=([0.4,0.5],[0.2,0.3])([0.3,0.6],[0.3,0.4])([0.6,0.7],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.6],[0.1,0.2])([0.4,0.7],[0.1,0.2])([0.6,0.7],[0.1,0.2])([0.3,0.6],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.5],[0.1,0.4])([0.3,0.4],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.7],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.5],[0.1,0.3])([0.6,0.8],[0.1,0.2])([0.3,0.6],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.5],[0.1,0.4])([0.5,0.8],[0.1,0.2])([0.5,0.6],[0.1,0.2])Each alternative, Ai, can be associated its collective attitudinal expected score value as the weighted average of its corresponding assessment profile(27)sλ(Ai)=∑j=1nwj·ES˜WC(α˜ij)λ=∑j=1nwj·(1−λ)·(μij−−νij+)+λ·(μij+−νij−)Example 3Continuation of Example 2Assume the following BUM function Q(y)=y1/3, which results in the following attitudinal character value λ=3/4 and attitudinal expected score value matrixES˜WC(α˜ij)3/4=0.2500.2000.4500.4250.5000.5500.3000.3000.1500.4000.3250.6250.3000.3000.6000.450The collective attitudinal expected score values are:s3/4(A1)=0.3275,s3/4(A2)=0.42,s3/4(A3)=0.3675,s3/4(A4)=0.510.The final ranking of the alternatives would be:A4≻A2≻A3≻A1.The ranking of the alternatives depends on the value chosen for the attitudinal parameter λ, and therefore it would be interesting to know the conditions under which a change in the attitudinal value does not result in a reverse ordering of two alternatives. These conditions are given in the following sensitivity analysis theorem of the collective attitudinal expected score value (27).Theorem 4Let λ be an attitudinal parameter value under which it has been established that sλ(Ak)≤sλ(Al). Let Δλ be a perturbation of the attitudinal character λ with 0≤λ+Δλ≤ 1. Then we havesλ+Δλ(Ak)≤sλ+Δλ(Al)iffmax−λ,sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifθk<θl−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifθk=θl−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl,ifθk>θlwhereθk=∑j=1nwj·μkj+−μkj−+νkj+−νkj−andθl=∑j=1nwj·μlj+−μlj−+νlj+−νlj−.ProofNotice that Δλ is subject to the following constraint:−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ.We have the following relation between sλ+Δλ(Ak) and sλ(Ak):sλ+Δλ(Ak)=sλ(Ak)+Δλ·θk,withθk=∑j=1nwj·μkj+−μkj−+νkj+−νkj−.The following equivalence holds:(28)sλ+Δλ(Ak)≤sλ+Δλ(Al)⇔Δλ·(θk−θl)≤sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak).Three scenarios are possible:•θk=θl. Because sλ(Ak)≤sλ(Al) then (28) is true for any value of Δλ, i.e.−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ.θk>θl⇔Δλ≤sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl, and therefore:−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl.θk<θl⇔Δλ≥sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl, and therefore:max−λ,sλ(Al)−sλ(Ak)θk−θl≤Δλ≤1−λ.Example 4Continuation of Example 2The general attitudinal expected score value matrix expression with respect to λ isES˜WC(α˜ij)λ=0.1+0.2·λ−0.1+0.4·λ0.3+0.2·λ02+0.3·λ0.2+0.4·λ0.4+0.2·λ0.4·λ0.4·λ0.2·λ0.1+0.4·λ0.1+0.3·λ0.4+0.3·λ0.4·λ0.4·λ0.3+0.3·λ0.3+0.2·λThe collective attitudinal expected score values are:sλ(A1)=0.11+0.29·λ,sλ(A2)=0.18+0.32·λ,sλ(A3)=0.12+0.33·λ,sλ(A4)=0.15+0.38·λ.We observe thatsλ(A4)>sλ(A3)>sλ(A1)∀λ⇒A4≻A3≻A1∀λsλ(A2)>sλ(A3)>sλ(A1)∀λ⇒A2≻A3≻A1∀λHowever, regarding the comparison of A2 and A4, we have the following•If λ∈[0, 0.5) then A2≻A4If λ=0.5 then A2∼A4If λ∈(0.5, 1] then A4≻A2∀ λ∈[0, 0.5) we have: A2≻A4≻A3≻A1.If λ=0.5 then A2∼A4≻A3≻A1.∀λ∈(0.5, 1] we have: A4≻A2≻A3≻A1.Therefore only when the value of λ is close to 0.5, we may have a reversal ordering of the alternatives A2 and A4. It is worth remarking here that the final ordering of the alternatives not only depends on the value of the attitudinal character but also on the particular criteria weighting vector, an issue that will be the focus of future research work.The collective attitudinal expected score values results in a total ordering of the set of alternatives. For those alternatives with same collective attitudinal expected score values, we apply the second level ordering with the application of the collective attitudinal accuracy score value(29)aλ(Ai)=∑j=1nwj·EA˜WC(α˜ij)λ=∑j=1nwj·(1−λ)·(μij−+νij−)+λ·(μij++νij+)An alternative expression to (29) for the collective attitudinal accuracy score value can be obtained if the relationship (20) between the the attitudinal expected accuracy score function and the attitudinal expected accuracy function is used:(30)aλ(Ai)=∑j=1nwj·EA˜WC(α˜ij)λ=∑j=1nwj·ES˜WC(α˜ij)λ+(νij++νij−)=sλ(Ai)+∑j=1nwj·(νij++νij−).Example 5Continuation of Example 2In Example 4, we had s0.5(A2)=s0.5(A2)=0.34. It is easy to prove that in this case we have that a0.5(A2)=a0.5(A2)=0.74, so we cannot decide yet which alternative is the best. To do that, we apply the third level ordering based on the use of the membership uncertainty index. Obviously, a different criteria weighting vector to the one used in these examples might have led to different attitudinal expected accuracy values.A similar reasoning to that of Theorem 4 can be used to prove the following sensitivity analysis of the collective attitudinal expected accuracy value (27):Theorem 5Let λ be an attitudinal parameter value under which it has been established that aλ(Ak)≤aλ(Al). Let Δλ be a perturbation of the attitudinal character λ with 0≤λ+Δλ≤ 1. Then we haveaλ+Δλ(Ak)≤aλ+Δλ(Al)iffmax−λ,aλ(Al)−aλ(Ak)θk−θl≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifθk<θl−λ≤Δλ≤1−λ,ifθk=θl−λ≤Δλ≤min1−λ,aλ(Al)−aλ(Ak)θk−θl,ifθk>θlwhereθk=∑j=1nwj·μkj+−μkj−+νkj+−νkj−andθl=∑j=1nwj·μlj+−μlj−+νlj+−νlj−.For those alternatives with same collective attitudinal expected score values and collective attitudinal accuracy score value, we apply the third level ordering with the computation of their respective collective membership uncertainty indexes.(31)T(Ai)=∑j=1nwj·μij+−μij−−νij+−νij−.Example 6Finishing Example 2The collective membership uncertainty indexes corresponding to alternatives A2 and A4 are T(A2)=−0.04 and T(A4)=0.04, and therefore the final ranking of the set of alternatives when λ=0.5 would be:A2≻A4≻A3≻A1.
