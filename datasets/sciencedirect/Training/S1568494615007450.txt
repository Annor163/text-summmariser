Solution of optimal power flow (OPF) problem aims to optimize a selected objective function such as fuel cost, active power loss, total voltage deviation (TVD) etc. via optimal adjustment of the power system control variables while at the same time satisfying various equality and inequality constraints. In the present work, a particle swarm optimization with an aging leader and challengers (ALC-PSO) is applied for the solution of the OPF problem of power systems. The proposed approach is examined and tested on modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power system with different objectives that reflect minimization of fuel cost or active power loss or TVD. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with other evolutionary optimization techniques surfaced in recent state-of-the-art literature. Statistical analysis, presented in this paper, indicates the robustness of the proposed ALC-PSO algorithm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is an optimization tool through which secure and economic operating conditions of a power system is determined [1–7]. The goal of OPF is to find out the optimal settings of a given power system network that optimize a certain objective function while satisfying its power flow equations, system security and equipment operating limits. Different control variables (some of which are generators’ real power outputs and voltages, transformer tap changing settings, phase shifters, switched capacitors and reactors) are manipulated to achieve an optimal network setting based on the problem formulation. The most commonly used objective is the minimization of the overall fuel cost function. However, other traditional objectives are minimization of active power loss, bus voltage deviation, emission of generating units, number of control actions and load shedding [1–7].OPF problem has been solved by both conventional as well as evolutionary algorithms. Conversional mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming (LP) [1], non-linear programming (NLP) [2], quadratic programming (QP) [3], Newton method (NM) [4–6] and interior point methods (IPM) [7] etc. have been applied in the literature to solve the OPF problem. Usually, these methods rely on the assumption that the fuel cost characteristics of the generating units are smooth and convex [8]. In the recent past, heuristic algorithms such as, genetic algorithm (GA) [9], improved GA (IGA) [10], enhanced GA (EGA) [11], evolutionary programming (EP) [12], differential evolution (DE) [13,14], biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [15–17], gravitational search algorithm (GSA) [18,19], etc. have been proposed for solving the OPF problem. The results reported were promising and encouraging for carrying out further research work in this direction.In the recent past, a powerful evolutionary algorithm such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is employed for power system optimization problems [20]. PSO, developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 [21], is one of the swarm intelligence techniques based on simulating the food-searching behavior of birds. Application of PSO in diversified field of power systems is reported in [22,23]. However, this technique too has limitations and is prone to suffer from the so-called “explosion” phenomena [24]. Hence, continuous emphasis is being given by the researchers’ pool toward the improvement of the original PSO.Various improved version of PSO has been employed in the literature to solve the OPF problem of power systems. Zhao et al. [25] have used improved PSO (IPSO) algorithm to solve an OPF with non-stationary multi-stage assignment penalty function. Gaing [26] has employed a mixed integer PSO (MIPSO) technique for constrained OPF problem with valve point nonlinearities. AlRashidi and El-Hawary [27] have applied a hybrid PSO (HPSO) approach to solve OPF problem considering the valve point loading effect. Vaisakh and Srinivas [28] have proposed a PSO with differentially perturbed velocity and adaptive acceleration coefficient (called as APSO-DV) for solving the OPF problem of power systems with non-smooth and non-convex generator fuel cost characteristics. A discrete PSO (DPSO) has been proposed in [29] for the solution of OPF problem of power system with distributed generation.Chen et al. have presented a modified PSO, called as PSO with aging leader and challenges (ALC-PSO) [30], based on the general law of nature that every organism in the earth ages and has a limited lifespan. With the passage of time, leader of the colony becomes old and feeble. And, this old leader has no longer the capability to lead the colony unless or otherwise it is challenged by a new and young challenger with great deal of enthusiasm and motivation to accomplish certain objectives. Thus, aging provides opportunities for the other individuals of the colony to challenge the leadership capability of the leader.In ALC-PSO [30], the lifespan of the leader is adaptively tuned in accordance with the leader's leading power. If a leader shows strong leading power, it lives longer to attract the swarm toward better positions. Otherwise, if a leader fails to improve the swarm and gets old, new particles emerge to challenge and claim the leadership which, in turn, brings in diversity. In this way, the concept of aging in ALC-PSO actually serves as a challenging mechanism for promoting a suitable leader to lead the swarm. In this way, natural aging mechanism of the organism has been modeled in ALC-PSO.In the present work, the effectiveness of the proposed ALC-PSO algorithm is tested for the solution of OPF problem of modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power systems with three different individual objectives such as (a) fuel cost minimization, (b) transmission active power loss (PLoss) minimization and (c) reduction of TVD taken one at time. The results yielded by the ALC-PSO are compared with those of other computational intelligence-based techniques surfaced in the recent literature.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, mathematical problem of the OPF work is presented. Basic conventional PSO is described in Section 3. In Section 4, ALC-PSO is narrated. Simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions of the present paper are drawn in Section 6.The objective of OPF is to minimize the objective function while satisfying all the equality and inequality constraints of the power system. The OPF problem may be formulated as [20,27] in (1) and (2).(1)MinimizeOF(x,y)(2)Subjectto:e(x,y)=0iel≤ie(x,y)≤ieuwhereOF(x, y)objective function;equality constraints;inequality constraints;lower and upper limits of the inequality constraints, respectively;vector of dependent variables consisting of slack bus active power, load voltages, generators’ reactive powers and transmission lines’ loadings, andvector of independent variables consisting of continuous and discrete variables.Hence,xandymay be expressed as in (3) and (4), respectively,(3)x=[PG1,VL1,…,VLNL,QC1,…,QCNG,Sl1,…,SlNTL](4)y=[PG2,…,PGNG,,VG1,…,VGNG,T1,…,TNT,,QC1,…,QCNC]whereNGnumber of generator buses,number of load buses,number of transmission lines,number of regulating transformers, andnumber of shunt compensators.The equality constraints represent the load flow equations as given in (5)(5)PGi−PLi=∑j=1N|Vi||Vj|(Gijcosδij+Bijsinδij)QGi−QLi=∑j=1N|Vi||Vj|(Gijsinδij−Bijcosδij)whereVi, Vjvoltages of the ith and the jth bus, respectively;active and reactive powers of the ith generator, respectively;active and reactive powers of the ith load bus, respectively;conductance, admittance and phase difference of voltages between the ith and the jth bus, respectively, andnumber of buses.(i)Generator constraints: Generator voltage, active and reactive powers of the ith bus should lie between their respective upper and lower limits as given in (6).(6)VGimin≤Vi≤VGimax,i=1,2,…,NG,PGimin≤Pi≤PGimax,i=1,2,…,NG,QGimin≤Qi≤QGimax,i=1,2,…,NG,whereVGimin, VGimax: minimum and maximum generator voltage of the ith generating unit, respectively;PGimin, PGimax: minimum and maximum active power of the ith generating unit, respectively andQGimin, QGimax: minimum and maximum reactive power of the ith generating unit, respectively.Load bus constraints: Load bus voltage should lie between its respective upper and lower limits and may be represented by (7).(7)VLimin≤Vi≤VLimax,i=1,2,…,NLwhere VLimin,VLimax: minimum and maximum load voltage of the ith bus, respectively.Transmission line constraints: Line flow for each transmission line must be within its capacity limits and these limits may be expressed by (8).(8)Sli≤Slimax,i=1,2,…,NTLwhereSli: apparent power flow through the ith branch,Slimax: maximum apparent power flow limit of the ith branch.Transformer tap constraints: Transformer tap settings are bounded between upper and lower limits as given by (9)(9)Timin≤Ti≤Timax,i=1,2,…,NTwhere Timin,Timax: minimum and maximum tap setting limits of the ith transformer, respectively.Shunt compensator constraints: Reactive power outputs of shunt VAR compensator, assumed as optimizing continuous variable, must be restricted within their upper and lower limits as in (10)[13,19](10)Qcimin≤Qci≤Qcimax,i=1,2,…,NCwhere Qcimin,Qcimax: minimum and maximum VAR injection limits of the ith shunt capacitor, respectively.In this paper, three different objective functions are considered to determine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. These objective functions are as follows:(i)Minimization of fuel cost: The aim of this type of problem is to minimize the total fuel cost while satisfying all equality and inequality constraints and it may be formulated as follows:(11)MinFC(PG)where FC(PG): the total fuel cost in $/h.(a)Fuel cost with quadratic cost function: Total fuel cost of generating units having quadratic cost function without valve point effect is given by(12)FC(PG)=∑i=1NGFi(PGi)=∑i=1NGai+biPGi+ciPGi2where ai, bi, ci: cost coefficients of the ith generator.Fuel cost with valve point loading effect: For more practical and accurate model of the cost function, multiple valve steam turbines are incorporated for flexible operational facilities. Total cost of generating units with valve point loading is given by(13)FC(PG)=∑i=1NGFi(PGi)=∑i=1NG(ai+biPGi+ciPGi2+|di×sin{ei×(PGimin−PGi)}|)where di, ei: fuel cost coefficients of ith unit with valve point effect.Minimization of transmission loss: The mathematical formulation of this type objective function is given by(14)MinPLosswhere PLoss: the total power losses. Power losses may be, mathematically, formulated as follows(15)PLoss=∑k=1NTLGk(Vi2+Vj2−2|Vi||Vj|cosδij)where Gk: the conductance of the kth line connected between the ith and the jth buses.Minimization of TVD: This minimization objective deals with the improvement of voltage profile. The objective function considered in this case is to minimize the voltage deviation of all the buses from 1.0p.u. and may be, mathematically, formulated as in (16)(16)MinTVDwhere TVD: the total absolute voltage deviation. The voltage deviation may be formulated as follows:(17)TVD=∑i=1N|Vi−Vref|where Vref: reference voltage (which is taken as 1.0p.u.).Nature-inspired search algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms and those based on swarm intelligence, lack a mechanism to deal with the constraints of a numerical optimization problem. Nowadays, however, there exists a considerable amount of research devoted to design techniques for handling constraints within a nature-inspired algorithm. The most representative constraint-handling techniques, currently, available have been briefly discussed and analyzed in [31]. In the present work, the violated result is obtained by using penalty factor approach in line with [32]. The merits of penalty factor method over the ensemble of other constraint-handling techniques have been discussed in [32]. References [31,32] may be referred for further study on this topic.PSO [21] is a swarm intelligence based algorithm inspired by the social dynamics and an emergent behavior which arises in socially organized colonies. PSO algorithm exploits a population of individuals to probe promising regions of the search space. In this context, the population is called swarm and the individuals are called particles or agents. In PSO algorithm, each particle moves with an adaptable velocity within the regions of decision space and retains a memory of the best position it has ever encountered. The best position ever attained by each particle of the swarm is communicated to all other particles.PSO is initialized with a population of particles randomly positioned in a d-dimensional search space. Each particle in the population maintains two vectors viz. a velocity vector and a position vector. During each generation, each particle updates its velocity and position by learning from the particle's own historically best position and the best position found by the entire swarm so far. Let,V→i(t){v→i1(t),v→i2(t),…,v→id(t)}andX→i(t){(x⇀i1(t),x→i2(t),…,x→id(t)}be the ith particle's velocity vector and position vector at the tth iteration, respectively, and NPbe the number of particles in a population. In the original PSO [21], the update rules for the velocity and the position vectors are given by(18)v→ij(t+1)←w(t)×v→ij(t)+c1×r1j×{x→pBestij−xij(t)}+c2×r2j×{x→gBestj−x→ij(t)}(19)xij(t+1)←xij(t)+vij(t+1)wherex→pBesti(x→pBesti1,x→pBesti2,…,x→pBestid) is the historical best position of the particle i (i=1, 2, …, NP),x→gBest(x→gBest1,x→gBest2,…,x→gBestd) is the historical best position of the entire swarm; c1 and c2 are two parameters to weight the relative importance ofx→pBestiandx→gBest, respectively;r1jandr2jare random numbers uniformly distributed in [0,1]; and j (j=1, 2,…, d) represents the jth dimension of the search space. The symbol “×” represents the component-wise product of the corresponding vectors. In (18),wis the inertia weight, which controls the degree that the velocity of a particle at the tth iteration influences the velocity of that particle at the (t+1)th iteration and its value at the tth iteration is determined by (20)(20)w(t)←wmax−wmax−wminTmax×twhere Tmax is the maximum number of iteration cycles and the symbols ‘min’ and ‘max’ represent minimum and maximum values ofw, respectively. In PSO model, particles share information through the swarm attractorx→gBestand evoke memories by particle attractorsx→pBestiin accordance with (18) and (19), respectively.In ALC-PSO [30], it is assumed that the leader of the swarm ages within a limited lifespan. The lifespan is adaptively adjusted according to the leader's leading power. When the lifespan is exhausted, the leader is challenged and replaced by newly generated particles. Therefore, the leader in ALC-PSO is not necessarily be thex→gBestbut a particle with adequate leading power guaranteed by the aging mechanism.To differentiate the leader in ALC-PSO from thex→gBestof original PSO [21], the leader is denoted byx→Leader(x→Leader1,x→Leader2,…,x→Leaderd). The velocity update rule of (18) is, thus, changed to(21)v→ij(t+1)←w(t)×v→ij(t)+c1×r1j×{x→pBestij−xij(t)}+c2×r2j×{x→Leaderj−x→ij(t)}The flowchart of ALC-PSO is illustrated in Fig. 1and the steps involved are given below [30].Step 1Initialization: The initial positions of all the particles are randomly generated within their respective minimum and maximum values with velocities initialized to 0. Historical best position of the particles (x→pBesti) are calculated. The best particle among the swarm is selected as thex→Leader. The age of the leader is initialized to θ=0 and the lifespan Θ of the leader is set to an initial value, Θ0.Step 2Velocity and position updating: Velocity and position of each particle are updated in accordance with (21) and (19), respectively.Step 3Updatingx→pBestiandx→Leader: For particle i(i=1, 2, …, Np), if the newly generated position Xiis better thanx→pBestithen Xibecomes the newx→pBesti. In addition, if the best position built in this iteration is better than thex→Leader, then thex→Leaderis updated to be the best position in this iteration. In this sense, this step is similar to that of the conventional PSO, but thex→Leaderrepresents the best solution generated by particles during the leader's lifetime.Step 4Lifespan control: After the positions of all particles are updated, the leading power of the leader is evaluated to improve the entire swarm. The lifespan Θ is adjusted by a lifespan control mechanism [30] based on the leading power of the leader. The probable different cases of lifespan control mechanism are as follows:Case (a): Ifδx→gBest<0, Θ is increased by 2.Case (b): Ifδx→gBest=0and∑i=1Npx→pBesti(θ)<0, Θ is increased by 1.Case (c): Ifδx→gBest=0,∑i=1Npx→pBesti(θ)=0andδx→Leader=0, Θ remains unchanged.Case (d): Ifδx→gBest=0,∑i=1Npx→pBesti(θ)=0andδx→Leader=0, Θ is reduced by 1.Step 5Generating a challenger: A new particle is generated and is used to challenge the leader whose lifespan is exhausted. A challengerx→Challengerjis generated by using (25)(25)x→Challengerj=random(Lj,Uj),rndj<prox→Leaderj,otherwise,j=1,2,…,dwhereLj, Uj: upper and lower bounds of dimension j, respectively;pro: comparative parameter ∈(0, 1).Step 6Evaluating the challenger: The leading power of the newly generated challenger is evaluated by repeating Step 2 and Step 3 for iter number of iterations withx→Leaderreplaced byx→Challengerin velocity update rule of (21) as(26)v→ij(k+1)←w(k)×v→ij(k)+c1×r1j×{x→pBestij−xij(k)}+c2×r2j×{x→Challengerj−x→ij(k)}k=1,2,…,iterIf any of thex→pBestiis improved during these iter iterations, the algorithm accepts thex→Challengerand uses it to replace the oldx→Leaderto lead the swarm. The age and lifespan of the new leader are initialized to θ=0 and Θ=Θ0. Otherwise, the oldx→Leaderremains unchanged and will continue to lead the swarm.Step 7Termination condition checking: If the number of fitness function evaluations (NFFEs) or iteration cycles is larger than a predefined NFFE (NFFEmax) or maximum number of iteration cycles, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, go to Step 2 for a new round of iteration.According to the above procedure of the ALC-PSO, the aging mechanism mainly involves three tasks viz. (a) design of the lifespan controller for adjusting the lifespan of the leader according to its leading power, (b) generation of a new particle to challenge and replace the old leader and (c) use of criterion to decide whether the generated particle can be accepted as a new leader or not. For elaborate discussions on Step 4 (lifespan control), Step 5 (generating a challenger) and Step 6 (evaluating the challenger), the work of Chen et al. [30] may be referred. Pseudo code of ALC-PSO algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.Algorithm 1ALC-PSO algorithm.In the present work, both the conventional PSO and the proposed ALC-PSO algorithms are applied to modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power systems for the solution of OPF problem. The software was written in MATLAB 2008a computing environment and applied on a 2.63GHz Pentium IV personal computer with 3GB RAM. The value of NFFEmax was set to 500 for all the test cases. A guideline for selecting the best parameter setting of PSO (like c1 and c2) [20] and ALC-PSO (like c1, c2 and Θ0) is presented in Section A.1 of Appendix. Discussions on simulation results of the present work are presented below. Results of interest are bold faced in the respective tables to indicate the optimization capability of the ALC-PSO algorithm. In this study, 30 test runs have been performed for all the test cases to solve the OPF problem and the best results are presented along with the average CPU time of 30 test runs.Modified IEEE 30-bus test system is chosen as test system 1. The line data, bus data and the minimum and maximum limits of control variables have been adopted from [33,34]. The system has six generators at buses 1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 13 and four transformers with off-nominal tap ratio in lines 6–9, 6–10, 4–12 and 28–27. In addition, shunt VAR compensating devices are assumed to have been connected at buses 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 29 for reactive power control as in [33,34]. The voltages of all load buses have been constrained within limits of 0.95–1.05p.u. The simulation results will include optimal value of real power output and voltage magnitude of six generators, tap ratio of four transformers and reactive power injection by nine shunt VAR compensating devices of this test system along with the value of objective function for individual case study presented in the consequent subsections.(a)Case study 1.1 (Minimization of fuel cost without valve point effect): The optimum control parameter settings offered by conventional PSO and ALC-PSO algorithms are given in Table 1. A statistical comparison of the simulation results for this objective function of the chosen test system is reported in Table 2showing minimum, average and maximum costs as yielded by all the concerned optimization algorithms. The result obtained from the proposed algorithm are compared with those of the other methods like IPM [7], simplex method [7], EGA [11], project gradient [33], EP [34], de-coupled OPF by RGA [35], GA [35], RGA [35], GA-OPF [36], GAF-OPF [36], tabu search [37] and PSO in Table 3. It may be noted that the minimum fuel cost of 797.1457$/h, as obtained by using ALC-PSO, is 0.1915% less as compared to the previously reported best result of 798.675143$/h using GSA [19]. From, Table 1, it may be also observed that the computational cost of ALC-PSO is less as compared to the conventional PSO. Comparative PSO and ALC-PSO based convergence profiles of fuel cost for this case study of the power system are presented in Fig. 3. From this figure, it may be observed that the convergence profile of fuel cost for the proposed ALC-PSO based approach is the promising one.Case study 1.2 (Minimization of transmission loss without valve point effect): The proposed approach is applied for minimization of transmission loss as one of the objective function for this test system. The obtained optimal values of control variables yielded by the proposed ALC-PSO method are given in Table 4. The results obtained by the proposed ALC-PSO and conventional PSO algorithm are compared with those reported in the literature like base case [41] and EGA–DQLF [41]. The obtained minimum real power loss from the proposed approach is found to be 3.17MW. A reduction of 0.0308MWPLoss(i.e. 0.962%) is registered while adopting the proposed ALC-PSO in comparison to the previous best reported result of 3.2008MW yielded by EGA–DQLF in [41]. The comparative convergence profiles of the PLossfor this case study of the test power system as offered by the conventional PSO and the proposed ALC-PSO methods are presented in Fig. 4. From this figure, it may be inferred that the proposed ALC-PSO method converges faster as compared to PSO counterpart.Case study 1.3 (Minimization of TVD without valve point effect): The proposed ALC-PSO approach is applied for the minimization of TVD of this test power network. The results yielded by the proposed ALC-PSO and conventional PSO algorithm are presented in Table 5. The results obtained by the proposed ALC-PSO and PSO algorithms are compared with those reported in the literature like DE [13], BBO [15] and GSA [19]. From this table, 8.866% improvement in TVD may be recorded by using the proposed ALC-PSO based algorithm (0.0812p.u.) as compared to PSO counterpart (0.0891p.u.). PSO and ALC-PSO based convergence profiles of TVD for this case study of the test power system are presented in Fig. 5. Better convergence profile of the proposed ALC-PSO approach may be observed from this figure by means of its ability to reach the near-global optimal solution.Case study 1.4 (Minimization of fuel cost with valve point effect): In this case, a sine component is added to the cost curves of generators at buses 1 and 2 to reflect the valve point loading effect. The fuel cost may be represented as [42].(27)FC(PG)=∑i=12(ai+biPGi+ciPGi2+|di×sin{ei×(PGimin−PGi)}|)+∑i=3NGai+biPGi+ciPGi2Fuel cost is minimized after satisfying constraints as mentioned in Section 2. The results obtained from the ALC-PSO and PSO methods of this case study have been compared with those of MDE [8], BBO [15], GA [42], FPSO [42] and FGA [42] methods in Table 6. The total fuel cost as obtained by using ALC-PSO is 915.3243 $/h, which is 1.185% less than previously published best result of 919.7647$/h of BBO [15]. Fig. 6shows the variation of fuel cost against NFFEs for this test case yielded by PSO and ALC-PSO based approaches. Better near-global optimal convergence profile of the proposed ALC-PSO approach may be noted from this figure.In order to exhibit the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique in solving larger power system, IEEE 118-bus test system is considered as the test system 2 [43,44]. The system line data, bus data, variable limits and the initial values of control variables are given in [43,44]. The simulation results will include optimal value of real power output and voltage magnitude of fifty-four generators, tap ratio of nine transformers and reactive power injection by twelve shunt VAR compensating devices of test system 2 along with the value of objective function for individual case study presented in the consequent subsections.(a)Case study 2.1 (Minimization of fuel cost): Conventional PSO and ALC-PSO based OPF solutions of fuel cost minimization objective for the test power system is presented in Table 7. And the results obtained by the ALC-SPO and PSO algorithms are compared with those of NM [6], PSOIWA [17], PSOCFA [17], RGA [17] and BBO [17] in Table 8. This table demonstrates that a fuel cost reduction of 0.1422% from the previous best result of 129,735.11$/h as reported by BBO in [17] to 129,546.0847$/h is accomplished by using the proposed ALC-PSO approach. Convergence profiles of fuel cost, as yielded by the PSO and the proposed ALC-PSO are depicted in Fig. 7. This figure helps to conclude that inclusion of ALC strategy in the basic PSO algorithm results in faster convergence profile of the proposed ALC-PSO approach.Case study 2.2 (Minimization of TVD):The best OPF solutions as yielded by both conventional PSO and proposed ALC-PSO for TVD minimization objective of this test power system are tabulated in Table 9. In Table 10, PSO and ALC-PSO based results are compared with those of other optimization techniques recently reported in the literature like PSOIWA [17], PSOCFA [17], RGA [17] and BBO [17]. From this table, 4.3572% improvement in TVD may be recorded by using the proposed ALC-PSO based algorithm as compared to BBO [17]. Comparative PSO and ALC-PSO based convergence profiles of TVD for this case study of the test power system is presented in Fig. 8. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of TVD (p.u.) for the proposed ALC-PSO based approach for this test system is more promising one.Both parametric as well as non-parametric tests have been proposed in the literature for the statistical analysis that may focus on the behavior of the evolutionary algorithms over practical optimization problems. However, for single objective optimization problem (as considered in the present work), the results obtained are quite similar between a parametric and non-parametric analysis. Also, there are procedures for transforming or adapting sample results for being used by parametric statistical tests [45]. The parametric statistical analysis for the studied test systems (viz. IEEE 30- and 118-bus) is carried out and presented in Tables 11 and 12, respectively. From these two tables it may be noted that the proposed ALC-PSO algorithm offers the minimum values of best, worst, median and standard deviation (Sd) for all the studied test cases as compared to the PSO counterpart. This indicates the robustness of the proposed ALC-PSO algorithm.
