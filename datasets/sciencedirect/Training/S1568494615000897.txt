@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents the hybrid of the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion and the score level fusion for finger-knuckle-print (FKP) based authentication to improve over the individual fusion methods. The scores obtained from the fusion of the left index (LI) and the left middle (LM) and those obtained from the fusion of the right index (RI) and the right middle (RM) FKP are fused at the fuzzy decision level. The uncertainty in the local decisions made by the individual score level fusion methods is addressed by treating the error rates as fuzzy sets. The operating points (thresholds) are adapted to accommodate the varying the cost of false acceptance rate using the hybrid PSO algorithm that ensures the desired level of security. The error rates associated with the operating points are converted into the fuzzy domain by triangular membership functions and the alpha-cuts are applied on the membership functions for the better representation of uncertainty. The global fuzzy error rates are defuzzified using total distance criterion (TDC). The rigorous experimental results indicate that the hybrid fusion is superior to the component level fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Biometric fusion refers to combining information from multiple biometric sources. The key purposes for biometric fusion are to improve system accuracy, efficiency, applicability, and robustness. The biometric fusion can be achieved at the feature level, rank level, score level, or decision level. Of these the rank level fusion is not suitable for verification. The other fusion methods are described briefly:The feature level fusion refers to combining different feature vectors that are obtained from one of the following: multiple sensors for the same biometric trait, multiple instances of the same biometric trait, multiple units of the same biometric trait or multiple biometric traits and then classifying this fused feature vector into one of the classes: genuine or impostor. Suppose there are n biometric modalities. Letx→ibe the feature vector (for the input pattern X) corresponding to the ith biometric modality. After concatenating all the feature vectors the fused vector becomesx→=(x→1,x→2,…,x→n)which is then classified. For example, we can concatenate Gabor features of palmprint with the eigen-coefficients of face. Sometimes feature level fusion is not feasible when the feature vectors are not compatible. For example, minutiae points cannot be cocatenated with the eigen coefficients of face.In the score level fusion, the scores from different biometric modalities are fused to generate a single score, which in turn is used to arrive at the final decision (genuine or impostor). The scores contain ample information to discriminate between the genuine user and impostor [2]. In this paper we follow either the combination-based or the transformation-based approach for the score level fusion.We have used Triangular norm (T-norm) for the score level fusion [28]. For applying T-norm the scores must be converted to the range [0,1] by using Min–Max normalization [27].If S1, S2, and S3 are the normalized scores of the three modalities, then any two scores, say S1 and S2 are first combined to yield T(S1, S2), which, in turn, is combined with S3 to yield T(S3, T(S1, S2)). The order of combination is immaterial due to the associative and commutative properties of these norms. So the combined score S is given by:(1)S=T(S3,T(S1,S2))The fused score S is compared with a threshold, say, th which declares a user as genuine if S<th or impostor otherwise.We have used Frank T-norm T(x, y)=logp(1+((px−1)(py−1))/(p−1)), p=0.01 for the score level fusion.In the decision level fusion each biometric classifier gives a binary decision as the output (i.e. accept or reject) and the decisions from all the classifiers are combined using the fusion rules like AND or OR [3].The biometric authentication problem is treated as a binary hypothesis-testing problem [19], where each classifier applies a threshold on the matching scores to obtain the decision whether user is genuine or impostor. H0 is the null hypothesis representing an impostor and H1 is the true hypothesis representing a genuine; the decision by the ith biometric classifier ui=1 indicates that the user is genuine and that ui= 0 represents that the user is an impostor. A Bayesian framework is adopted here to determine the uniqueness of authentication in terms of error rates FAR and FRR. Let the number of available biometric modalities be n and U=(u1, u2, …, un) be the decision vector. The error rates defined in terms of probabilities are given by FARi=p(ui=1|H0) and FRRi=p(ui=0|H1) corresponding to ith biometric modality. The decision of whether a person is genuine or impostor is made by the likelihood test ([23]):(2)p(U|H1)p(U|H0)≷ug=0ug=1ηwhere η=((C10−C00)p0)/((C01−C11)p1) and ugis the global decision of the fusion system and p0 and p1 are the probabilities of a user being an impostor or genuine respectively. The four possible outcomes and their associated costs (bracketed figures) are as follows:1.The genuine person is accepted (C11).The genuine person is rejected (C01).The impostor is accepted (C10).The impostor is rejected (C00).The cost of false acceptance (CFA) and the cost of false rejection (CFR) correspond to the above as follows: CFA=C10 and CFR=C01 and CFA+CFR=2. When C00=C11=0, i.e. cost of right decision is zero. Also all the biometric classifiers are independent, sop(U|H1)=∏i=1np(ui|H1)andp(U|H0)=∏i=1np(ui|H0). So η=(CFA/CFR). Now Eq. (2) leads to(3)∏i=1np(ui|H1)∏i=1np(ui|H0)≷ug=0ug=1ηCross multiplying, we get(4)∏i=1np(ui|H1)≷ug=0ug=1η∏i=1np(ui|H0)The choice of costs CFR and CFA in Eq. (4) is what is needed to control the global errors which will lead to the optimal selection of rules and the operating points. We use Eq. (4) to determine whether the user is genuine or impostor.It may be noted that the decision level fusion has less information content than the score level fusion, but it is capable of selecting an optimal operating point by using an optimization method [1].In this paper, we consider an extension of the decision level fusion called the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion that takes into account the uncertainty in the decisions. Fuzzification is necessitated [4] as it models the uncertainty in the data by appropriate choice of the membership functions. It is adaptive, because the decisions from the individual biometric modalities are combined adaptively and a decision rule is selected to meet the desired security constraint.We will now give a brief survey of the important studies made on the decision level fusion which we want to convert into the fuzzy domain.In the literature AND and OR rules are more popular for the decision level fusion and it is proved in [5] that a combination of the two decisions using AND or OR rules often has the risk of degrading the overall performance when the performance of the component classifiers is significantly different. One mostly favored approach for the decision level fusion is the majority vote [6] where a count of the number of decisions d from the component classifiers is made and the decision having the largest count is taken as the final decision. Its derivative called weighted majority voting [8] assigns different weights to different classifiers as per the performance of the component classifiers. This approach transforms the output values from binary decisions to continuous numbers. The weighted majority voting approach further improves the performance of the majority voting. Other approaches include: Bayesian decision fusion [10], the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence [11] both of which convert the decisions into scores by learning parameters from a training set. The decisions from several modalities (e.g., still image, speech) are combined by using fuzzy k-means (FKM) [12], fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) algorithms [13], and the median radial basis function (MRBF) network [14] in [15]. The experimental results show that fuzzy clustering algorithms have better performance than the classical clustering algorithms and other known fusion algorithms. MRBF performs better especially when two modalities are combined. In this, the quality of the biometric data is used for the fuzzification.An optimal fusion is achieved at the decision level in [16] by the use of AND or OR rule, by optimizing the matching score thresholds. This fusion gives an improvement over the component classifiers in the Neyman–Pearson sense. The above decision level fusion achieves a performance that is comparable to or better than the conventional score-level fusion. It is observed that the performance of the threshold-optimized decision-level fusion using OR rule does not deteriorate even in the presence of outliers. The decision paradigms investigated in [17] adopt the reduced polynomial model for biometric decision fusion. Experiments on fingerprint, speech, and hand geometry biometric data show that local learning alone can improve the equal error rates. A reduced multivariate polynomial model is introduced to overcome the tedious recursive learning problem associated with the neural network training.A non-parametric statistical approach is presented for the decision level fusion in [18], which stresses upon the importance of classifier selection while combining the decisions. However this technique requires sufficient training data to obtain reasonable estimates of the densities of the classifier output. The hybrid of the decision level fusion and the score level fusion discussed in [1] do not consider the uncertainty in the decisions. An adaptive management of multimodal biometrics (AMBM) is proposed in [19], where the decisions from the individual biometric sensors are combined adaptively and a decision rule is selected to meet the desired performance constraint. The AMBM algorithm is certainly plausible but it has several drawbacks. The number of rules to be considered for the fusion becomes exponentially large if the number of modalities is increased, thus increasing the time complexity of the fusion. It is proved in ([21]) that an optimum fusion rule for any set of Bayesian costs is monotonic. However, this proof does not consider the case when any of the individual sensor operating points (FARi, FRRi) is zero as observed in [22]. The results reported in [19] also indicate that the search space is limited to only a few monotonic rules which can inherently prevent other optimum rules from being selected.In this paper, the uncertainty associated with the local biometric decisions are modeled by fuzzyfying the error rates. A Bayesian approach is utilized to design the optimum fusion rule for the case of statistically independent local biometric decisions. The approach of adaptive decision level fusion [19] is briefly described now.In this approach [19] the individual biometric's decisions are combined by optimizing the global error using the hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [20] algorithm. The global error will be defined as a function of fusion rule and the operating points which are the local error rates. The costs CFA and CFR are varied as per the security requirements. It may be noted that the hybrid PSO used in the adaptive decision level fusion algorithm [19] for bimodal biometric system minimizes the global error by learning the operating points and the fusion rule. The number of rules for n biometric modalities is22n.Let FARj(j=1 to n) be the false acceptance rate of jth biometric system, FRRj(j=1 to n) be the corresponding false rejection rate, and d=(d1, d2, …, ds) be s bit fusion rule (s=2n). Now the global false acceptance rate GFAR and global false rejection rate GFRR are evaluated as:(5)GFAR=∑i=0s−1di∏j=1nψARjwhereψARj=1−FARj,uj=0FARj,uj=1and(6)GFRR=∑i=0s−1(1−di)∏j=1nψRRjwhereψRRj=FRRj,uj=01−FRRj,uj=1The global Bayesian error denoted by E is expressed in terms of the global false acceptance (GFAR) and rejection rates (GFRR) as:(7)E=CFA*GFAR+CFR*GFRR=CFA*GFAR+(2−CFA)*GFRRwhere * denotes the scalar product.Here CFA is varied as per the user specification and for each value of CFA, hybrid PSO learns the operating points by minimizing E in Eq. (7).Table 1lists 16 fusion rules for two biometric modalities. In Table 1, u1 and u2 indicate the possible decisions of modalities 1 and 2 respectively.We now discuss the adaptive decision level fusion for the bimodal biometric system:Let FAR1,2=FAR1*FAR2, FRR1,2=FRR1*FRR2where * denotes the scalar product.The GFAR in Eq. (5) is expanded to obtain,(8)GFAR=d0(1−FAR1−FAR2+FAR1,2)+d1(FAR2−FAR1,2)+d2(FAR1−FAR1,2)+d3FAR1,2Similarly, GFRR in Eq. (6) is expanded to obtain,(9)GFRR=d0FRR1,2+d1(FRR1−FRR1,2)+d2(FRR2−FRR1,2)+d3(1−FRR1−FRR2+FRR1,2)Each biometric modality makes the local decision (accept or reject) regarding the authenticity of an unknown user. The task is to combine the decisions from each biometric modality optimally. The fusion rule (which combines the decisions from different modalities) can be learned and the operating points can be selected using the hybrid PSO which minimizes the global error given by Eq. (7).The above formulation does not take into account the uncertainty in the local decisions.We now present the motivation for the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion which is the main theme of this paper.It is observed that the adaptive decision level fusion method in [19] does not consider the uncertainty associated with the decisions due to which the error rates of individual modalities that are involved in the fusion also vary. Therefore, we are motivated to address this issue by fuzzifying the error rates that give rise to the decisions.The motivation to address the uncertainty in the decisions in the adaptive decision level fusion stems from the previous work (not in the context of biometrics) on fuzzy decision level fusion in [24].If we increase the number of modalities then the number of rules increases exponentially which will further increase the complexity of the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion. To do away with the increased complexity we are motivated to go in for the hybrid fusion by combing both score level fusion and adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the adaptive fuzzy Bayesian decision framework. Section 3 presents an approach for the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion. Section 4 deals with the hybrid of score level and the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion. The extraction of two types of features for the representation of finger-knuckle-prints (FKPs) is presented in Section 5. The experimental results are discussed in Section 6. The conclusions are given in Section 7.The relevant fuzzy logic concepts needed for the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion are relegated to Appendix A. To address the uncertainty in the decisions made about a user based on a modality, the corresponding error rates (both FAR and FRR) are treated as the fuzzy sets. The error rates in Eq. (4) are converted into the fuzzy domain by triangular membership function as p′(ui|H1) and p′(ui|H0). The products ∏p′(ui|H1) and ∏p′(ui|H0) also become fuzzy. We will make use of these fuzzified error rates to derive the likelihood ratio test. In the fuzzy domain, Eq. (4) reduces to(10)(∏i=1np′(ui|H1))≷ug=0ug=1η(∏i=1np′(ui|H0))For defuzzification, we apply total distance criterion (TDC) in Appendix A. Applying 2nd property of TDC, Eq. (10) leads to(11)T(∏i=1np′(ui|H1))≷ug=0ug=1ηT(∏i=1np′(ui|H0))The above can be written as:(12)T(∏i=1np′(ui|H1))T(∏i=1np′(ui|H0))≷ug=0ug=1ηThus, the decision criterion in Eq. (12) is in terms of the defuzzified error rates.We now develop adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion for a bimodal biometric system by considering the uncertainty in FARjand FRRj. For this, we treat FARjand FRRjas the normal singleton fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets are represented by the triangular membership functions, which are varied by α-cuts to achieve adaptivity.The above normal singleton fuzzy sets are converted into the triangular membership function, trimf(x;a, b, c) with the parameters a, b, and c as follows:trimf(x;a,b,c)=0,x≤ax−ab−a,a<x≤bc−xc−b,b<x≤c0,x>cThe lower and upper α-cuts of the triangular membership function can be derived from its parameters as: α(b−a)+a and c+α(b−c). Let us representμFAR1andμFAR2by the triangular membership function corresponding to the FARs of two individual biometric modalities. LetμFAR1=trimf(x;FAR1−k1,FAR1,FAR1+k2), where k1, k2 need to be learned using the hybrid PSO. Let far1 be the fuzzy set corresponding toμFAR1, and it is a normal fuzzy set since one of its elements has the unity membership function,μFAR1(FAR1)=1. Its lower and upper α-cut sets are:μFAR1L(α)=FAR1+αk1−k1andμFAR1U(α)=FAR1−αk2+k2. Similarly, letμFAR2=trimf(x;FAR2−l1,FAR2,FAR2+l2), where l1, l2 need to be learned using the hybrid PSO. Let far2 be the fuzzy set corresponding toμFAR2. Just like far1, far2 is also a normal fuzzy set. Its lower and the upper α-cut sets are:μFAR2L(α)=FAR2+αl1−l1andμFAR2U(α)=FAR2−αl2+l2.Similarly let frr1 and frr2 be the fuzzy sets of the false rejection rates of the individual biometric modalities corresponding to the triangular membership functionsμFRR1andμFRR2. LetμFRR1=trimf(x;FRR1−m1,FRR1,FRR1+m2)withμFRR1L(α)=FRR1+αm1−m1andμFRR1U(α)=FRR1−αm2+m2. LetμFRR2=trimf(FRR2−n1,FRR2,FRR2+n2)withμFRR2L(α)=FRR2+αn1−n1andμFRR2U(α)=FRR2−αn2+n2. The fuzzy sets frr1 and frr2 are the normal fuzzy sets sinceμFRR1(FRR1)=1andμFRR2(FRR2)=1for the reason mentioned above in connection with far1 and far2.For the sake of simplicity, we denoteFAR1L(α)=μFAR1L(α),FAR1U(α)=μFAR1U(α),FAR2L(α)=μFAR2U(α),FRR1L(α)=μFRR1L(α),FRR1U(α)=μFRR1U(α),FRR2L(α)=μFRR2L(α),FRR2U(α)=μFRR2U(α).Since the local errors are fuzzified now, the global false acceptance and false rejection rates are fuzzy. The global fuzzified Bayesian error is given by as(13)E′=CFA*GFAR′+(2−CFA)*GFRR′where GFAR′ and GFRR′ are the fuzzified global false acceptance and false rejection rates. For the purpose of defuzzification, TDC, being a mapping from fuzzy to crisp is applied on Eq. (13) leading to:(14)T(E′)=CFA*T(GFAR′)+(2−CFA)*T(GFRR′)(Using the 2nd property of TDC)Let the α-cut set of GFAR′ be:(15)(GFAR′)α=[GFARL(α),GFARU(α)]The lower and the upper components of(GFAR′)αare now elaborated as:(16)GFARL(α)=d0(1−αhigh(FAR1)−αhigh(FAR2)+αlow(FAR1,2))+d1(αlow(FAR2)−αhigh(FAR1,2))+d2(αlow(FAR1)−αhigh(FAR1,2))+d3αlow(FAR1,2)(17)GFARU(α)=d0(1−αlow(FAR1)−αlow(FAR2)+αhigh(FAR1,2))+d1(αhigh(FAR2)−αlow(FAR1,2))+d2(αhigh(FAR1)−αlow(FAR1,2))+d3αhigh(FAR1,2)whereαlow(FAR1)=FAR1L(α)andαhigh(FAR1)=FAR1U(α)Using the properties of α-cuts, we obtain,αlow(FAR1,2)=min{FAR1L(α)FAR2L(α),FAR1L(α)FAR2U(α),FAR1U(α)FAR2L(α),FAR1U(α)FAR2U(α)}αhigh(FAR1,2)=max{FAR1L(α)FAR2L(α),FAR1L(α)FAR2U(α),FAR1U(α)FAR2L(α),FAR1U(α)FAR2U(α)}The α-cut set of the global false rejection rate (GFRR′) in the fuzzy domain is:(18)(GFRR′)α=[GFRRL(α),GFRRU(α)]The lower and the upper components in Eq. (18) are now expanded to give:(19)GFRRL(α)=d0αlow(FRR1,2)+d1(αlow(FRR1)−αhigh(FRR1,2))+d2(αlow(FRR2)−αhigh(FRR1,2))+d3(1−αhigh(FRR1)−αhigh(FRR2)+αlow(FRR1,2))(20)GFRRU(α)=d0αhigh(FRR1,2)+d1(αhigh(FRR1)−αlow(FRR1,2))+d2(αhigh(FRR2)−αlow(FRR1,2))+d3(1−αlow(FRR1)−αlow(FRR2)+αhigh(FRR1,2))whereαlow(FRR1)=FRR1L(α)αhigh(FRR1)=FRR1U(α)Using the properties of α-cuts, we obtain,αlow(FRR1,2)=min{FRR1L(α)FRR2L(α),FRR1L(α)FRR2U(α),FRR1U(α)FRR2L(α),FRR1U(α)FRR2U(α)}αhigh(FRR1,2)=max{FRR1L(α)FRR2L(α),FRR1L(α)FRR2U(α),FRR1U(α)FRR2L(α),FRR1U(α)FRR2U(α)}The GFAR′ is defuzzified using TDC as:(21)GFAR=T(GFAR′)=0.5∫01(GFARL(α)+GFARU(α))dαSimilarly GFRR′ is defuzzified as:(22)GFRR=T(GFRR′)=0.5∫01(GFRRL(α)+GFRRU(α))dαThe performance of the biometric system is determined from T(E′) in Eq. (14) using the defuzzified values of GFAR′ and GFRR′. The hybrid PSO not only learns the operating points and the fusion rule adaptively but also the parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzified error rates.It may be noted that the score level fusion is sensitive to different normalization methods [27]. However, the strong point of the score level fusion is that the scores contain ample discriminatory information as discussed earlier. The fuzzy decision level fusion reduces the information content but it is capable of selecting an optimal operating point by using an optimization technique. In the fuzzy decision level fusion, the optimal operating point is not influenced by the score normalization [1].The reason for the hybridization of score level and fuzzy decision level fusions is in order.When the number of modalities increases, the number of possible fusion rules for the fuzzy decision level fusion increases exponentially. To reduce the complexity of selecting the best rule when the number of modalities increases, we propose hybrid of score level fusion and fuzzy decision level fusion. Now, the hybrid fusion is illustrated on finger-knuckle-prints (FKPs).We have four instances of FKPs: left index (LI), left middle (LM), right index (RI) and right middle (RM). If we fuse all FKPs (LI, LM, RI, and RM) using the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion, then the complexity will increase, as all the operating points and the corresponding parameters of the triangular membership functions of all FKPs need to be learned using an optimization technique. Moreover, the number of rules increases exponentially (224for four modalities) adding to the complexity. Here comes the role of hybrid fusion. The number of modalities is reduced from 4 to 2 by combining the left hand FKPs (LI and LM) and the right hand FKPs (RI and RM) at the score level separately and the resulting fused modalities are combined at the fuzzy decision level to limit the number of rules and to reduce the complexity of optimization. By hybridizing the two methods of fusion, an improved performance is expected over that of the individual methods of fusion. The score level fusion is performed using Triangular norms as in [28]. A block-diagram of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1.Let S1, S2, S3, and S4 be the scores of LI, LM, RI, and RM instances of FKPs respectively. The scores of left hand FKPs are fused using Frank T-norm as:(23)Sleft=T(S1,S2)The scores of right hand FKPs are fused using Frank T-norm as(24)Sright=T(S3,S4)Given CFA, the hybrid PSO is employed to learn the fusion rule, operating points, and the parameters of the triangular membership function to fuzzify the error rates. So the hybrid fusion is denoted by:(25)hybridfused=D(Sleft,Sright,CFA)where ‘D’ stands for the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion involving scores of two modalities and the cost factor.As the effective features are very important for the representation of FKPs and for the subsequent hybrid fusion, we now present two approaches.To get an idea of textures present on the instances of FKPs, let us observe their typical images. Fig. 2shows region of interest (ROI) of left index (LI), left middle (LM), right index (RI), and right middle (RM) instances of FKP.Fractals figure prominently in quantifying the surface finish in mechanical engineering applications. Fractal profiles are not self-similar but self-affine. However, fractal dimension on its own may not be sufficient to determine the roughness property. In such profiles, their self-affinity may be characterized by an additional measure called topothesy [31], which depends upon the fractal dimension. The term ”Topothesy“ denoted by Λ is coined by Thomas [33]. Topothesy is a method of measuring the surface roughness which is least influenced by the variations in a scale [34]. It represents the horizontal distance between two points on a measured surface corresponding to an average slope of one radian and has a dimensional unit of distance [32].Structure functionStructure function (SF) has a relation with the topothesy and fractal dimension together called fractal parameters. It quantifies the variations in the surface texture [35]. Note that 1-D SF is a function of z with a shift τ (1<τ<m) expressed as(26)S(τ)=∑i=1m−τ|z(i)−z(i+τ)|m−τSimilarly 2-D SF is a function of z with two shifts τxand τyin the x and the y directions respectively, expressed as:(27)S(τx,τy)=∑i=1m−τx∑j=1n−τy|z(i,j)−z(i+τx,j+τy)|(m−τx)(n−τy)We can interpret this structure function S(τx, τy) as the statistical expectation of the absolute difference of the values of z separated by a pair of shifts (τx, τy). In the context of 2-D images, the structure function accounts for the gray level variation in the pixels separated by shifts in x and y directions. It shows the behavior of the image surface for different values of shifts.As mentioned above SF and fractal parameters are related as [34]:(28)S(τ)=Λ2D−2τ2(2−D)The texture region of an image is divided into the non-overlapping windows; so the structure function for each window is computed. Fig. 3(b) displays the plot of structure function of FKP image for τx=τy=τ. The logarithmic plot of the structure function S(τ) vs. shift τ, i.e. logS(τ) vs. log(τ) is shown in Fig. 3(c). This plot gives a hyperbola and two asymptotes are drawn on it. We approximate the asymptotes by the best fit lines passing through the initial and the end points of the hyperbola shown in Fig. 3(c). The equation of the approximated asymptote is found by taking the logarithm of Eq. (28) on both the sides leading to log(S(τ))=(2D−2)log(Λ)+2(2−D)logτ=Intercept+Slope*logτ. Thus D is evaluated from the slope whereas Λ from the intercept of this logarithmic plot. Fig. 3(a) shows the plot of the asymptote with slope 2(2−D) and intercept (2D−2)log(Λ).The parameters, D and Λ, found from all windows are concatenated to form the resultant feature vector.Algorithm for the extraction of topothesy-fractal dimension features1.Divide the ROI image I into windows of size WXW where W is an odd number.For each window, repeat Steps 3–6 until all windows are exhausted.Calculate the structure function taking τx=τy=τ in Eq. (27)S(τ,τ)=∑i=1W−τ∑j=1W−τ|I(i,j)−I(i+τ,j+τ)|(W−τ)(W−τ),forallτ=1,2,…,W−1Take the logarithmic of the above structure function for each τ.Fit a hyperbola using the points (log(τ), log(S(τ))) (τ=1, 2, …, W−1)Draw two asymptotes to the hyperbola and use these to find the fractal dimension D and topothesy for the window under consideration.Form the feature vector by concatenating the topothesy and fractal dimension from all the windows.The use of Hanman transform developed as part of the Information set theory was made in [30] for transforming the fractal based iris texture features. Here we are concerned with deriving structure function transform features. The concept of information set arises from representing the possibilistic/probabilistic uncertainty present in the gray levels/probabilities of an image. We will now introduce the information set followed by Hanman transform.Information set: Consider a sub image of FKP. The gray levels in this subimage are fitted with a membership function. The uncertainty in the gray levels Iijcan be represented by the product Iijμijcalled the information value and a set of such values is called the information set {Iijμij}.Hanman transformConsider the non-normalized Hanman–Anirban entropy function in [7].(29)H=∑i=1n∑j=1npije−(apij3+bpij2+cpij+d)where pijare probabilities such that ∑i∑jpij=1, and a, b, c and d are the real-valued parameters.We now introduce the concept of transform with a view to empower the polynomial exponential gain function in the entropy function in Eq. (29) to evaluate the information source. Here we need the adaptive form of Eq. (29) where its parameters are assumed to be variable because the varying Hanman–Anirban entropy function can only facilitate the determination of the uncertainty from the spatially varying information source. The varying Haman–Anirban entropy is defined as,(30)Ht=∑i=1n∑j=1npije−(a(μ)pij3+b(μ)pij2+c(μ)pij+d(μ))For most of the problems the powers of 2 and 3 are not required, so we choose a(μ)=b(μ)=0, c(μ), d(μ)∈[0, 1], with the result the varying entropy function becomes:(31)Ht=∑i=1n∑j=1npije−c(μ)pij−d(μ)By choosing pij=Iij, c(μ)=μij, d(μ)=0 the above entropy function can be converted to the Hanman transform as follows:(32)Ht(I)=∑i=1W∑j=1WIije(−Hij)where Hij=Iijμij. The product of gray level and its membership function value has a great significance because it gives the information as perceived by the agent which in this case is the membership function.Histogram based Hanman transformTo cater to the spatially varying textures histogram representation is very useful. Considering g as the normalized gray level and h(g) as the frequency of occurrence of g then corresponding to the possibilistic uncertainty represented by {Iijμij} we can represent the probabilistic uncertainty by {gh(g)}. In this representation g is considered as the information source value and h(g) takes the role of the membership function.Then with a(μ)=b(μ)=d(μ)=0, c(μ)=h(g), pij=g, Eq. (30) becomes(33)Ht(I)=∑∑ge(−gh(g))As we have shown earlier, the product of g and μ(g), i.e. gμ(g) constitutes the possibilistic information value. Similarly the product of g and h(g) constitutes the probabilistic information value in the case of probability. Here h(g) takes the role of μ(g) because both μ(g) and h(g) are the functions of g. However μ(g) describes the quality of the information source values, whereas h(g) gives their frequency of occurrence. As stated here, the elements of the histogram based information set {g.h(g)} are very small because of a very few gray values of FKPs and palmprints.The plot g vs. h(g) gives the spatial variation of gray levels. The values of h(g) lie in the range [0,1] and ∑h(g)=1.Structure function based transform featuresConsider the structure function S(τ), with τ serving as an independent variable. Just as h(g) is a function of g; S(τ) is a function of τ. Therefore we can adapt Eq. (33) to the case of the structure function. So, the structure function based transform is obtained as(34)Hst=∑τ=1Wττm.e(−S(τ).ττm)where τmis the maximum value of τ. Here the image is divided into non overlapping window of size WXW. For each window, we compute the structure function. Then using Eq. (34) we evaluate Hstthat is our feature. This is repeated for all windows to get the feature vector.

This paper presents the results of the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion as well as those of the hybrid fusion which is the combination of the score level fusion and the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion on FKPs.The experimental results indicate that the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion outperforms the adaptive decision level fusion. The adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion approach developed in this paper handles the uncertainty associated with the local decisions by fuzzifying FARs and FRRs using the triangular membership functions. PSO learns the optimal fusion rule, operating points, and the parameters of the membership functions. Owing to the fuzzified FARs and FRRs, the global errors also become fuzzy. The likelihood ratio test, on receiving the fuzzy local biometric decisions, invokes the Bayesian decision criterion to deliver the global decision. The fuzziness of the local FARs and FRRs results in a fuzzy global Bayes risk which is defuzzified using TDC.The hybrid of score level fusion and adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion is more suitable than the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion when we have a large number of modalities.The contribution of the paper is three fold: (i) development of the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion for biometric authentication, (ii) development of hybrid fusion when we have the large number of the modalities and (iii) illustration of the above fusion methods on FKP database.The advantage of the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion is that it can handle uncertainty in the decisions by treating error rates as the fuzzy sets. This will give lesser global error as a result.The advantage with the hybrid fusion is that we do not have to deal with a large number of rules when the number of biometric modalities increases.The only disadvantage with the adaptive fuzzy decision level fusion is that we need to learn the parameters of the membership function.The fuzzy sets offer an easy way to handle the uncertainty in the decisions based on each of the biometric modalities. A triangular membership function is used to represent the fuzzy sets. Now we present some of the relevant definitions ([25]):Let Γ be the fuzzy set over a universe X=R.Definition 1The α-cut set of a fuzzy event γ is the subset of R such that for any rϵ(γ)α, μΓ(r)≥α, i.e.(γ)α={r|μΓ(r)≥α, rϵR}Definition 2A fuzzy set is said to be convex if and only if the membership function satisfies the following:(A.1)μΓ(λr1+(1−λ)r2)≥min(μΓ(r1),μΓ(r2)),∀r1,r2ϵRλϵ[0,1]Definition 3A convex fuzzy set in Definition 2 is said to be normal if there exists at least one element rϵR for which μΓ(r)=1. Further, γ is unimodal if there is only one value rϵR which makes μΓ(r)=1. Given any two fuzzy events A and B, the corresponding α-cut sets are denoted as, (A)α=[a1(α), a2(α)] and (B)α=[b1(α), b2(α)]. The following three properties hold good on the α-cut sets [25]:1.Addition (A+B)α=(A)α+(B)α=[a1(α)+b1(α), a2(α)+b2(α)]Negation: (−A)α=[−a2(α), −a1(α)]Multiplication: (AXB)α=[c1(α), c2(α)]c2(α)=max[a1(α)b1(α), a2(α)b1(α), a1(α)b2(α), a2(α)b2(α)]In the fuzzy decision level fusion, the fuzzified global errors need to be defuzzified and to accomplish this we need Total Distance Criterion (TDC) [26] that converts the fuzzy number into a crisp number. The mapping is done by means of the integration operation on the membership functions of the fuzzy set with respect to the membership grade α. For any fuzzy number γ with the membership function μΓ(γ), an equivalent crisp number is defined as:(A.2)T(γ)=∫0αmax0.5(Γ1α+Γ2α)dαwhereΓ1αandΓ2αare the lower and the upper limits respectively of the α-cut set of γ.For a normal fuzzy set, we have αmax=1. We now present some properties of TDC.1.For any two fuzzy parameters γ1 and γ2, the following preference rule is based on the TDC: γ1 is preferred over γ2 if T(γ1)>T(γ2).For any crisp parameter ‘a’, we have T(a)=a.For any non-negative real number ‘a’ and a fuzzy parameter γ, T(aγ)=aT(γ).For any two fuzzy numbers γ1 and γ2(A.3)T(γ1+γ2)=T(γ1)+T(γ2)For any fuzzy number γ, T(γ)>0.
