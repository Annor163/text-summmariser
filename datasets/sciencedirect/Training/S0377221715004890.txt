@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this article, we consider the T2 control chart for bivariate samples of size n with observations that are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. The cross covariance matrix of the sample mean vectors is derived with the assumption that the observations are described by a multivariate first order autoregressive model – VAR (1). The combined effect of the correlation and autocorrelation on the performance of the T2 chart is also investigated. Earlier studies proved that changes in only one variable are detected faster when the variables are correlated. This result extends to the case that one or both variables are also autocorrelated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In most literature on statistical process control, it is assumed that observations are independent over time. However, in many applications the dynamics of the process induce correlation in observations that are closely spaced in time. The autocorrelation has a serious impact on the performance of conventional control charts (Kalgonda & Kulkarni, 2004). Recently, Du and Lv (2013) proposed a control chart based on the minimal Euclidian distance to detect mean shifts in autocorrelated processes. Lin, Chou, Wang, and Liu (2012) considered the economic design of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) control chart, which has been shown to be suitable for monitoring series of autocorrelated data. Franco, Costa, and Machado (2012) considered the first-order autoregressive model, AR (1), to describe the wandering behavior of the process mean, and they used Duncan’s model to obtain the optimum values of theX¯chart parameters. Costa and Machado (2011) also used the AR (1) model to investigate the effect of the wandering behavior of the process mean on the performance of the variable parameterX¯chart and on the performance of the double samplingX¯chart.To reduce the negative effect of autocorrelation on the statistical performance of the ShewhartX¯control chart, Costa and Castagliola (2011) proposed a sampling strategy denoted ‘s-skip’. According to this strategy, samples are obtained by collecting one item from the production line and then skipping s consecutive items before selecting the next one. Alternatively, Franco, Castagliola, Celano, and Costa (2013) introduced the mixed sampling strategy where the samples are composed with units selected from the last two rational subgroups. A numerical analysis shows that the mixed sampling outperforms the skip sampling strategy for high levels of autocorrelation. Recently, Franco, Celano, Castagliola, and Costa (2014) investigated the economic-statistical design of theX¯chart with the skip sampling strategy.Modern manufacturing systems with advanced technology and high production rates results in processes that are multidimensional, cross and serially correlated. Hotelling (1947) suggested the use of the T2 statistic for monitoring the mean vector of multivariate processes. Seven decades later, Chen (2007) and Chen and Hsieh (2007) considered adaptive sampling schemes to enhance the performance of the T2 chart. Pan and Jarrett (2011) described some processes that are both multivariate and serially correlated. According to Huang, Bisgaard, and Xu (2014), autocorrelation increases the false-alarm risk, while cross-correlation reduces the power of the control chart. The combined effect of autocorrelation and cross-correlation on the performance of the T2 chart is worth to be investigated.In many modern processes the observations of correlated quality characteristics gathered in rational subgroups of size n are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. In this context, and under the assumption that the observations are given by a multivariate first order autoregressive model, VAR (1), in this paper we obtain the cross-covariance matrix of the sample mean vector (ΓX¯). The cross-covariance matrixΓX¯is important for the investigation of the effect of cross-correlation and autocorrelation on the performance of the T2 chart.The paper isorganized as follows. Section 2 and Appendix A describe the VAR (1) model and the bivariate cross-covariance matrix of the sample mean vector. Section 3 investigates the effects of autocorrelation and cross-correlation on the performance of the T2 chart. Section 4 presents an illustrative example. Section 5 gives the conclusion and suggests for future research. In Appendix B, we investigate the level of the autocorrelations for which the detection power of the T2 chart for individual observations is equal to the detection power of the T2 chart for samples of size n.Autocorrelation measuresthe dependence between observations of the same quality characteristic, while cross-correlation measures the dependence between observations of the monitored quality characteristics. The multivariate autoregressive model for cross and serially correlated data has been adopted in recent studies dealing with multivariate control charts (Huang et al., 2014; Huang, Xu, & Bisgaard, 2013; Hwarng & Wang, 2010; Pan & Jarrett, 2007).(1)Xt−μ=Φ(Xt−1−μ)+ɛtwhere Xt∼ Np(μ,Γ) is the (p × 1) vector of observations at time t (p is the number of variables),μis the mean vector, εtis an independent multivariate normal random vector with a mean vector0=(0,…,0)′and covariance matrixΣ, andΦis a (p × p) matrix of autocorrelation parameters. A recent study dealing with the estimation of the mean vector is in (Wang, Huwang, & Yu, 2015). According to Kalgonda and Kulkarni (2004), the cross covariance matrixΓof Xthas the following property:Γ=ΦΓΦ′+Σ. After some algebra we obtain(2)VecΓ=(Ip2−Φ⊗Φ)−1VecΣwhere ⊗ is the Kronecker product and Vec is the operator that transform a matrix into a vector by stacking its columns.To study the effects of the auto- and cross-correlation on the performance of the T2 chart, we consider the case of a bivariate process (p = 2)(3)Φ=(a00b),Σ=(σeX2σeXYσeXYσeY2)=(σeX2ρσeXσeYρσeXσeYσeY2)where ρ is the correlation of X and Y. We did not find examples in SPC where the observations of one variable at time (i) are dependent of the observations of the other variable at time (i-1). The assumption of a diagonal matrixΦis very realistic.From (2) and (3) it follows:(4)Γ=(σX2σXYσXYσY2)=((1−a2)−1σeX2(1−ab)−1σeXY(1−ab)−1σeXY(1−b2)−1σeY2)The cross covariance matrixΓX¯of the sample mean vectorX¯for rational subgroups of size n is developed in Appendix A(5)ΓX¯=(ζ11ζ12ζ21ζ22)whereζ11=σX2n[1+2n∑j=1n−1(n−j)aj];ζ22=σY2n[1+2n∑j=1n−1(n−j)bj];ζ12=σXYn[1+1n∑j=1n−1(n−j)aj+1n∑j=1n−1(n−j)bj].and whereζ21=ζ12.In the absenceof autocorrelation (a = b = 0),ΓX¯reduces toΨX¯=n−1Σ. LetΓX¯−1be the inverse of matrixΓX¯defined as(6)ΓX¯−1=(θ11θ12θ21θ22)Table 1 brings the values of θ11, θ22 and θ12 = θ21 for ρ ∈ (0, 0.7), n ∈ (2, 4, 10), and several combinations of aandb. The elements of the main diagonal ofΓX¯−1increase with the cross-correlation and with the sample size but decrease with the autocorrelation. When the variables are independent, the off-diagonal elements ofΓX¯−1are zero, that is, θ12 = θ21 = 0. In the presence of the cross-correlation, they become negative.The Hotelling T2 control chart is the most referenced control scheme for detecting mean shifts in multivariate processes (Hotelling, 1947). This chart has been used in a wide variety of applications, for example, recently Faraz, Heuchenne, Saniga, and Foster (2013) considered the use of the T2 chart to control a delivery chain. When the in-control mean vectorμ0=(μ01,μ02)and the matricesΦandΣare known, the monitoring statistic for Hotelling’s T2 control chart is given by(7)Ti2=(X¯−μ0)′ΓX¯−1(X¯−μ0)The terms of the cross-covariance matrixΓX¯of the sample mean vectorX¯only depend on the elements of the two matrices,ΦandΣ, see expression (5). During the in-control period,Ti2follows a chi-squared distribution with p degrees of freedom (χp2). Similarly to the work of Champ, Jones-Farmer, and Rigdon (2005), the upper control limit (UCL) of the chart is chosen to be the (1−α)th quantile of the chi-squared distribution to achieve a desired in-control Average Run Length (ARL) of 1/α, i.e.UCL=χp,α2. After the assignable cause occurrence the mean vector changes fromμ0 toμ1=(μ11,μ12)and the distribution of the monitoring statisticTi2changes to a non-central chi-squared distribution (χ(p,λ)2) with non-centrality parameterλ2=δ′ΓX¯−1δ,whereδ=(δ1,δ2)′=(μ11−μ01σeX,μ12−μ02σeY)′denotes the standardized mean vector shift, see (Wu & Makis, 2008) and (Franco et al., 2012) . Without loss of generalization, we considerμ01=μ02=0. In absence of autocorrelation, the non-centrality parameter is given byλ2=δ′ΨX¯−1δ. Asδ′ΓX¯−1δ<δ′ΨX¯−1δ,we conclude that autocorrelation reduces the ability of the chart to detect an assignable cause. According to expression (7),(8)Ti2=(X¯1+δ1)2θ11+(X¯2+δ2)2θ22+2(X¯1+δ1)(X¯2+δ2)θ12whereX¯1andX¯2are the sample means of the two quality characteristics used to control the bivariate process.To study the effects of auto- and cross-correlation on the performance of the T2 chart for bivariate process and we assume rational subgroups of size n = 4. The performance of the T2 chart is measured by the average run length (ARL). When the process is in-control, the ARL measures the rate of false alarms. A chart with a larger in-control ARL (ARL0) has a lower false alarm rate than other charts. A chart with a smaller out-of-control ARL has a better ability to detect process changes than other charts. In practice, a preliminary sample is taken to estimate the cross-covariance matrixΓand, subsequently, the parameters a, b and ρ; see Eqs. (3) and (4).The ARL value is given by(9)ARL=11−Pr(χ(p,λ)2<UCL)where UCL is the upper control limit of the T2 chart. Fig. 1 summarizes the effect of b on ( θ11, θ22, θ12) and on the ARL for a = 0 and for a = b. Fig. 1 was built considering two uncorrelated and two correlated variables. In this figure, disturbances affecting either a single variable or both of them were also considered. It is interesting to notice that the ARL is not affected by the autocorrelation if only one of the two independent variables is autocorrelated and robust to the occurrence of assignable causes (ρ = 0, a = 0, b ≠ 0, δ2 = 0). As λ is a function ofΓX¯,the performance of the T2 chart depends on the adopted model. An interesting subject of research is to study the T2 chart when the processes are described by VAR (p) models, with p > 1.To investigate the effect of the autocorrelation level on the overall performance of the bivariate T2 charts, the ARLs in Tables 2, 3 and 4 were computed with Eq. (9). We considered uncorrelated variables,ρ=0,and variables with low and high correlation,ρ=0.3or 0.7. Tables 2 and 4 consider the cases in which the two variables are affected by the assignable cause (in Table 2,δ1=δ2,and in Table 4, δ1 ≠ δ2). Table 3 considers the cases in which only one variable is affected by the assignable cause (δ1 orδ2=0).In the absence of autocorrelation (a=b=0) or in the presence of two variables with the same level of autocorrelation (a=b≠0), higher dependence between the two variables improves the performance of the T2 chart in signaling shifts in only one variable (δ1 ≠ 0;δ2=0orδ1=0; δ2 ≠ 0). For instance, in Table 3, if(a,b,δ1,δ2)=(0,0,0,1.0)and the variables are uncorrelated (ρ=0), the T2 chart requires, on average, 9.41 samples to signal. This number decreases to 3.15 when the variables are highly correlated (ρ=0.7). When the assignable cause shifts both variables the ARLs increase with ρ. For instance, in Table 2, if(a,b,δ1,δ2)=(0.7,0.7,1.0,1.0)and the variables are uncorrelated (ρ=0), the T2 chart requires, on average, 41.01 samples to signal. This number increases to 76.85 when the variables are highly correlated (ρ=0.7).If only onevariable is autocorrelated and only one variable is affected by the assignable cause (a ≠ 0;b=0ora=0; b ≠ 0 and δ1 ≠ 0;δ2=0orδ1=0; δ2 ≠ 0): a) higher dependence between the two variables improves the T2 chart’s performance. For instance, in Table 3, if (a,  b,  δ1,  δ2) = (0, 0.2, 1.0, 0) and the two variables are uncorrelated (ρ = 0), the T2 chart requires, on average, 9.41 samples to signal. This number decreases to 3.24 when the variables are highly correlated (ρ=0.7). b) the ARLs are always higher when the variable affected by the assignable cause is the autocorrelated one. For instance, in Table 3, ifρ=0.3and (a,  b,  δ1,  δ2) = (0, 0.2, 0, 1.0) the T2 chart requires, on average, 13.99 samples to signal. This number decreases to 8.08 when (a,  b,  δ1,  δ2) = (0, 0.2, 1.0, 0).The performance of the T2 chart depends on the inverse of the cross covariance matrix of the sample mean vector. Its parameters θ11 and θ22 increase with the size of the sample, but θ11 decreases with a, and θ22 decreases with b. Table 5 shows several combinations of ρ, a, b, and n for whichΓX¯−1=Σ−1; in these cases, the detection power of theT2 chart based on individual observations is equal to the detection power of the T2 chart based on rational subgroups of size n, see Appendix B for details. Figs. 2 and 3 show for low and high cross-correlated variables,ρ={0.3,0.7},the range of b values for which the T2 chart for individual observations is superior to the T2 chart for rational subgroups of size two (or five). In Fig. 2,δ1=δ2=1.0,anda=b; in Fig. 3,δ1=0,δ2=1.0,anda=0. Fig. 4 shows a case where the ARL is nearly independent of b.To investigate the effect of the sample size on the performance of the T2 chart, Tables 6, 7 and 8 present the ARL values for n ∈ {1, 2, 5}, ρ ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.7} and 96 combinations of (a, b, δ1, δ2). When the two autocorrelated variables have the same high level of autocorrelation (a=b=0.7), the bivariate T2 chart for individual observations performs better than the bivariate T2 chart for rational subgroups of size two, or even five. When the observations of only one of the two variables are autocorrelated (a=0,b=0.5ora=0.5,b=0), there are combinations of (ρ, δ1, δ2) for which the bivariate T2 chart for individual observations performs better than the bivariate T2 chart for rational subgroups of size two (see the ARLs in bold).The inner diameter (X) and the thickness (Y) of carbon fiber tubes are monitored during the drilling process. With the process in control, a preliminary sample was collected and the two quality characteristics were measured, see Table 9. This example was introduced by Santos Fernández (2012).A study based on this database allowed to conclude that the two variables satisfactorily fits to a VAR (1) model. The adequacy of the model was tested using the goodness-of-fit Portmanteau test, for details see (Lütkepohl, 2005). The database was also used to estimate the in-control mean vector, the cross covariance matrixΓand the autocorrelation matrix, see (Montgomery, 2009) for detailsμ^0=(μ^0X,μ^0Y)=(10.44,30.00)Γ^=(σ^X2σ^XYσ^XYσ^Y2)=(0.49620.37410.37410.5888)Φ^=(a^00b^)=(σ^Xi,Xi−1σ^X200σ^Yi,Yi−1σ^Y2)=(0.4820000.4782)whereσ^Xi,Xi−1(σ^Yi,Yi−1) is the covariance of the X (Y) observations that are one time period apart.The Eqs.

The samples values were simulated with an assignable cause that shifts the process mean vector fromμ^0=(10.44,30.00)toμ^1=(10.75,30.67)that is,δ1=0.5andδ2=1.0. The T2 chart requires, on average, 29.25 samples to signal. This number reduces to 5.81 when the variables are non-autocorrelated.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In thisarticle we evaluated the performance of the bivariate Hotelling’s T2 chart for rational subgroups with observations that are not only cross-correlated but also autocorrelated. The autocorrelation has a strong and negative impact on the performance of the T2 chart, especially when more frequents and/or larger shifts occur on the mean of the variable with the higher level of autocorrelation. It is also worth to note that, depending on the level of the autocorrelations the T2 chart based on individual observations signals faster than the T2 chart based on rational subgroups. For example, when the observations of two variables have the same level of autocorrelation and they are moderate or high (a=b>0.5), the bivariate T2 chart for individual observations performs better than the bivariate T2 chart for rational subgroups of size two. Regarding to the correlation, if the dependence among X observations and among Y observations are the same (or close), that is, a ≅ b, T2 chart has a better overall performance when the variables X and Y are highly correlated.The authors are currently investigating the use of the skip sampling strategy proposed by Costa and Castagliola (2011) and the mixed sampling strategy proposed by Franco et al. (2013) to reduce the negative effect of the autocorrelations on the statistical performance of the T2 control chart.
