The direct time domain analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beams subject to impulse load using the discrete Hilbert transform may lead to the unstable growth in damped time responses owing to the incorrectness of Hilbert-transformed imaginary impulse force and the insufficient time duration of applied impulse force. To resolve this problem, a time domain analysis method making use of the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension is introduced in this paper. The incorrect imaginary impulse force near the end of time period, which is caused by the fact that the discrete Hilbert transform using Fourier transform considers the impulse force as a periodic function, is resolved by dividing the external impulse force into a finite number of rectangular impulses. And, the sufficient time duration of applied impulse force is estimated by a Newton–Raphson-based iterative residual method. The validity of the present method is justified from the numerical experiment for analyzing the time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The damped vibration responses of complex structural dynamics such as sandwich beam structures with viscoelastic layers [1,2] are usually analyzed in either frequency or time domain. In the frequency domain analysis, the external excitation force is expressed as harmonic force so that the imaginary part is automatically defined. But, in the time domain analysis, the external excitation force is real contrary to the complex-valued dynamic equation system. In order to maintain the consistency in the complex-valued dynamic equation system, the real-valued external impulse force can be converted into an analytic force signal by defining the imaginary force signal using Hilbert transform [3–5]. Meanwhile, a state-space formulation in the modal superposition approach to solve the time response of the damped dynamic system leads to two poles which are radial symmetry in the complex plane [3]. The radial symmetry implies that one pole is stable but the other is unstable such that the standard numerical solving techniques cannot provide a successful solution because the unstable pole causes unbounded growth in the damped dynamic response. To avoid such an unbounded growth, the time-reversal technique [6,7] is used, in which the time differential equation corresponding to the unstable pole is converted to one running backwards in time.However, the time domain analysis making use of the Hilbert transform and the time-reversal technique may lead to the incorrect damped time response owing to two problems, the incorrect Hilbert-transformed imaginary force and the insufficient time duration of applied external force. The Hilbert transform can be analytically derived according to its mathematical definition if the input force signal is expressed in a well-defined explicit function of time. However, for arbitrary input force signals, their Hilbert transforms are alternatively obtained by a combined use of Fourier (FT) and inverse Fourier transforms (IFT) according to the fundamental properties of the complex-valued strong analytical signal [5]. But, such a discrete Hilbert transform using FT and IFT may provide us the incorrect imaginary function near the end of time period because Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms consider the input force signal as a periodic function. Meanwhile, the time duration for the time domain analysis is set based on the original real-valued external force, but it may be insufficient for the imaginary external force. The Hilbert-transformed imaginary force may not be zero at the beginning even though its original real-valued external force starts with zero value, which gives rise to the incorrect unstable time response. This problem is solely owing to the fact that the time duration of complex-valued analytic force is set based on the original real-valued external force. It can be resolved by extending the time duration for the time domain analysis so that the imaginary force starts with a sufficiently small value.As an extension of our work on the forced vibration of damped sandwich beams [8,9], the purpose of this paper is to introduce a time-duration extended Hilbert transform superposition method for the reliable impulse response analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beams in time domain. In order to resolve the above mentioned problem of the discrete Hilbert transform by a combined use of FT and IFT near the end of time period, the Hilbert transform of arbitrary external force is obtained by the superposition method. An arbitrary continuous real-valued force signal is divided into a finite number of rectangular impulses and its Hilbert transform is obtained by summing up the analytic Hilbert transforms of each rectangular impulse. Since the analytic Hilbert transform of rectangular impulse is derived by the mathematical definition of Hilbert transform, the above-mentioned discrepancy near the end of time period can completely disappear. Meanwhile, the original time duration set based on the real-valued external force is extended by a Newton–Raphson-based iteration method, based on the fact that Hilbert transform conserves the magnitude of an original input signal [5]. The difference in squared areas between the original and Hilbert-transformed functions is defined as a residual functional, and the original time duration is successively extended in both the negative and positive time directions until the relative residual satisfies the preset tolerance.The present method is applied to analyze the time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam [10–12] in order to illustrate and validate the theoretical work. The five-layered damped sandwich beam is modeled using 2-node 8-DOF damped beam elements which are developed based on the principle of virtual work and the compatibility relation between the lateral displacement and the shear strains [9]. The complex finite element matrix equations are derived in both time and frequency domain, and the time-reversal technique is applied to the corresponding state-space formulation in the mode superposition approach. Through the numerical experiments, the validity of the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension algorithm are examined, and the forced time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam is compared with those obtained by IFT and the Hilbert transform superposition method without extending the time duration.This paper is organized as follows. The finite element approximation of the forced vibration of five-layered damped sandwich beam using 8-DOF damped beam elements is addressed in Section 2. The application of time-reversal technique for the time domain analysis of linear complex structural dynamics is briefly summarized in Section 3. The Hilbert transform superposition for defining the correct imaginary impulse force and the time-duration extension using a Newton–Raphson-based residual method are explained in Section 4. The numerical experiments for illustrating the present method are represented in Section 5 and the conclusion is made in Section 6.In the current study, we consider a five-layered damped sandwich beam shown inFig. 1 as an engineering example of complex structural dynamic problems. The beam of lengthLand widthbwith rectangular cross-section undergoes the lateral dynamic deflection under the action of time-varying vertical loadf(x,t). Three metal layers of thicknessesh1,h3andh5are linear elastic with Young׳s moduli ofE1,E3andE5, while two darkened layers of thicknessesh2andh4are linearly viscoelastic with complex shear moduliG2⁎=G2(1+iη2)andG4⁎=G4(1+iη4)respectively. Here,η2andη4indicate the loss factors and(⋅)⁎denotes the complex value throughout this paper. It is assumed that the beam thickness is sufficiently small compared to the beam length and five layers are completely bonded so as not to allow slipping at the layer interfaces. Further assumptions are made for the analysis of the beam transverse displacement: (1) the transverse direct strains in all the five layers are small enough so that the lateral displacement is uniform across any section of the beam, (2) the longitudinal and rotary effects are negligible, (3) three metal layers obey Kirchhoff hypothesis so as not to produce transverse shear strains, and (4) two viscoelastic layers obey Kerwin assumption [13,14] so that the longitudinal direct strains are much small than the shear strains.The beam can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and the transverse shear strainsγ2andγ4in two viscoelastic layers are calculated by(1)γI=dIhI∂w(x,t)∂x+uI−1(x)−uI+1(x)hI,I=2,4using the slopes ofu1,u3andu5with respect to the x-axis [9,15–18]. Then, the complex transverse shear stresses in two viscoelastic layers are calculated byτ2⁎=G2⁎γ2andτ4⁎=G4⁎γ4. The transverse shear strains and stresses are uniform across the thickness becauseu1,u3,u5andware independent ofz, which are consistent with the above mentioned assumption (4). By denotingD1=E1h13/12,D3=E3h33/12andD5=E5h53/12to be the flexural rigidities of three metal layers, the transverse shear resultants exerted on metal layers are calculated by(2)SI=DIAI∂3w∂x3,I=1,3,5Since the complex shear resultants on two viscoelastic layers areS2⁎=−τ2⁎A2andS4⁎=−τ4⁎A4, the total complex transverse shear force exerted on the sandwich beam cross-section becomes(3)St⁎=(DA)t∂3w∂x3−G2⁎A2γ2−G4⁎A4γ4with(DA)t=D1A1+D3A3+D5A5. Meanwhile, the axial resultant forcesP1,P3andP5in each metal layer are straightforwardly calculated by(4)PI=EIAI∂uI∂x,I=1,3,5withAIbeing the cross-section areas of each layer.The finite element approximation of forced vibration of five-layered damped sandwich beam is derived based on the principle of virtual work. The total kinetic energyTof the beam is given by(5)T(t)=12∫0LρAt(∂w∂t)2dxwithρandAtbeing the density and the total cross-section area of beam. Meanwhile, the shear strain energyVband the extensional strain energyVtof three metal layers are(6)Vb(t)=12∫0L(DA)t(∂2w∂x2)2dx(7)Vt(t)=12∫0L[E1A1(∂u1∂x)2+E3A3(∂u3∂x)2+E5A5(∂u5∂x)2]dx=Z12∫0L[(h2γ′2−d2w″)2+Z3(h4γ′4=−d4w″)2+Z5(h2γ′2+h4γ′4−(d2+d4)w″)2]and the transverse shear strain energyVsof two viscoelastic layers is(8)Vs(t)=12∫0L(G2⁎A2γ22+G4⁎A4γ42)dxwithZ1=E1E3A1A3/(E1A1+E3A3+E5A5)andZ3=E3A3/E1A1andZ5=E5A5/E1E3A1A3. Note thatu′1,u′2andu′3in Eq. (7) are replaced withw″,γ′2andγ′4using Eqs. (1) and (2) and the constraint [9]:E1A1u′1+E3A3u′3+E5A5u′5=0.The lateral deflectionwand two transverse shear strainsγ2andγ4are interpolated using 2-node damped sandwich beam shown inFig. 2, where beam elements of length2awhich are discretized for the damped sandwich structure are mapped onto the master element with the length of 2. The interpolation of three fieldsw,γ2andγ4within each damped beam element of length2ais given by(9)w(ξ;t)=[N⁎(ξ)]{w¯}e,γ2(ξ;t)=[H⁎(ξ)]{w¯}e,γ4(ξ;t)=[Γ⁎(ξ)]{w¯}ewith{w¯}e={(wθγ2γ4)1(wθγ2γ4)2}Tbeing the element-wise nodal vector. Note that the rotationθof beam axis is added to implement all the possible essential boundary conditions for damped sandwich beams [9,16], and it is explicitly interpolated using the relation ofθ=∂w/∂x. Each complex matrix[N⁎(ξ)],[H⁎(ξ)]and[Γ⁎(ξ)]is composed of eight complex shape functionsNi⁎(ξ),Hi⁎(ξ)andΓi⁎(ξ)respectively, which are in function of the loss factorη, the material properties and geometry dimensions of the damped sandwich beam. The detailed derivation of these complex shape functions is out of scope of this paper, but the reader may refer to our previous paper [9] for the concept of polynomial-based damped sandwich beam.Substitutingw(ξ;t)from Eq. (9) into Eq. (5) leads to the element-wise complex mass matrices defined by(10)[M⁎]e=a∫−11ρ[N⁎]T[N⁎]dξAnd, substituting Eq. (9) into Eqs. (6)–(8) provides us the element-wise complex stiffness matrices given by(11)[K⁎]e=(DA)ta3∫−11[N″⁎]T[N″⁎]dξ+a∫−11{G2⁎A2[H⁎]T[H⁎]+G4⁎A4[Γ⁎]T[Γ⁎]}dξ+1E1A1+E3A3+E5A5∫−11Λ⁎(ξ)dξwhereΛ⁎(ξ)indicates the integrand stemming from the extensional strain energy of three metal layers. Meanwhile, the element-wise load vectors are defined by(12){f}e=a∫−11f(ξ;t)[N⁎]TdξSumming up the element-wise matrices and vectors over all the elements leads to a complex linear matrix equation system of motion:(13)[M⁎]{w˜¨}+[K⁎]{w˜}={f⁎}Differing from the frequency domain analysis where the external excitation force is expressed as a harmonic function, the real-valued external impulse force{f}in the time domain analysis should be converted into a complex-valued analytic force{f⁎}in order for the consistency of the complex-valued dynamic equation system (13). One may obtain the impulse response, such as the peak dynamic displacement and the decaying characteristics, by taking the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the frequency response. But, not only such Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms become an extra job but also the converted impulse response in time domain is affected by the resolution of frequency response function (FRF). In this context, a somewhat novel direct time-domain analysis method for Eq. (13) is introduced in this paper, motivated by the fact that an arbitrary real-valued impulse force can be decomposed into a finite number of well-defined rectangular impulse signals and its imaginary part can be obtained by superposing the Hilbert transforms of those rectangular impulses. Furthermore, the resulting complex-valued analytic impulse force could provide the accurate impulse response when its time duration is appropriately extended.Letwa(t)andfa(t)be the analytic signals (i.e., complex signals composed of real and imaginary parts) of the damped beam deflectionw(t)and the external excitation forcef(t), the previous linear complex equation system (13) for the forced vibration of five-layered damped sandwich beam is rewritten as(14)[M⁎]{w˜¨a}+[K⁎]{w˜a}={fa⁎}The complex mass and stiffness matrices[M⁎]and[K⁎]which are expressed in terms of the complex shear modulusG⁎are not Hermitian but symmetrically similar to those for the finite element approximation of linear elasticity problems. And, the complex matrix Eq. (14) of motion leads to the conjugate complex eigen values, which causes the numerical instability and divergence when the time response is sought by the standard time integration schemes like the discrete-time implementation of the convolution signal [3]. In order to overcome such a numerical instability and divergence, the time-reversal technique which has been studied for a long time in acoustic and medical applications [6,7] is widely adopted.In order for the time-domain analysis by the mode superposition approach, the analytic deflectionwa(t)is expanded as a linear combination of the analytic participation coefficientspak(t)and the complex natural modes{Xk⁎}such that(15)wa(t)={pa(t)}[X⁎]Substitutingwa(t)into the above complex matrix Eq. (14) leads to the decoupled complex ordinary differential equations for each analytic participation coefficientpak(t)[17,18]:(16)mk⁎p¨ak(t)+ωk2(1+iη)pak(t)={Xk⁎}T{f˜a(t)}withmk⁎={Xk⁎}T[M⁎]{Xk⁎}being the M-orthogonalized complex-valued mass. A state-space formulation to solve the time response of Eq. (16) becomes(17){ẏa(t)}=[A]{ya(t)}+[B]{f˜a(t)},{ya(t)}={pak(t)ṗak(t)}with two matrices defined by(18)[A]=[01−ωk2(1+iη)0],[B]=[0{Xk⁎}T/mk⁎]Let us denote(s1⁎,s2⁎)kand{Φ1Φ2}to be the complex eigen values and eigenvectors of[A], respectively, where(s1⁎)k=−a+iband(s2⁎)k=−(s1⁎)k=a−ib(aandbare positive real numbers). We simply denote(s1⁎)kand(s2⁎)kbysk⁎and−sk⁎for the sake of simplicity. Referring to Inaudi and Makis [3],−sk⁎causes the unbounded growth in the time response{ya(t)}of the hysteretic damping system when a standard time integration scheme is used.In order to uncouple the dynamics of the bounded response bysk⁎from the unbounded one by−sk2⁎,{ya(t)}is expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of[A]by(19){ya(t)}=[Φ]{q1(t)q2(t)},[Φ]={ϕ1ϕ2}=[11sk⁎−sk⁎]by definingq1(t)andq2(t)be the analytic modal coordinates. By reversing the time in the modal coordinateq2(t)asr=−tandq˜2(r)=q2(t), the time derivative ofq2(t)is transformed into(20)q̇2(t)=dq2(t)dt=dq˜2(r)drdrdt=−q˜′2(r)Then, the previous state-space formulation (17) can be rewritten as(21)[Φ]{q̇1(t)−q˜′2(r)}=[A][Φ]{q1(t)q˜2(r)}+[B]{f˜a(t)}Using the relation given by[Φ−1][A][Φ]=diag[sk⁎,−sk⁎], one can obtain two stable differential equations given by(22){q̇1(t)q˜′2(r)}=[sk⁎00−sk⁎]{q1(t)q˜′2(t)}+{1/2sk⁎mk⁎−1/2sk⁎mk⁎}{Xk⁎}T{f˜a(t)}in which the first one runs in forward intwhile the second one runs in backward int.The Hilbert transformH[f(t)]of a signalf(t)is a linear operator defined by the convolution off(t)and such that(23)f^(t)=H[f(t)]=1πlima→∞P∫−aa−f(τ)t−τdτwith the Cauchy principal value given by(24)P∫−aaf(τ)t−τdτ=limε→0+[∫-at−εf(τ)t−τdτ+∫t+εaf(τ)t−τdτ]aroundτ=t. The Hilbert transform conserves the magnitude of an original signalf(t)and only produces a phase shift, and furthermore it possesses a linearity property such thatαf^(t)+βg^(t)is the Hilbert transform off(αt)+g(βt)for everyα,β>0[3,5].From the fact that the Hilbert transform is defined by the convolutionf^(t)=f(t)⁎(−1/πt)and the Fourier transform (FT) of(−1/πt)becomes(25)FT[−1/πt]=isgn(ω)withsgn(ω)=−1forω>0and 0 forω=0and 1 forω<0, the Fourier transform of the Hilbert transformf^(t)can be obtained using the Fourier transformF(ω)of the original signalf(t)such that(26)FT[f^(t)]=isgn(ω)F(ω)Thus, the Fourier transform of a strong analytic signalfa(t)=f(t)+if^(t)is defined by(27)FT[fa(t)]=Fa(ω)=F(ω)+isgn(ω)F(ω)and, thus the strong analytic signalfa(t)=f(t)+if^(t)can be obtained by the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the one-side-spectrumF+(ω)(=F(ω),ω>0):(28)IFT[2F+(ω)]=fa(t)Thus, the analytic signal of the real applied load for the forced vibration analysis of damped sandwich beam would be obtained by a combined use of discrete FT and IFT.But, the imaginary partf^(t)in analytic signal which is obtained using Eq. (28) may be different from one derived analytically using the definition of Hilbert transform (23) because the Fourier transform regards the input signal as a periodic function. In order to investigate this difference, let us consider a rectangular impulsef(t)=rect(t)shown inFig. 3(a). It is not hard to derive the Hilbert transformf^(t)given by(29)H[rect(t)]=f^(t)=1πln|t−t1/t−t2|by substitutingrect(t)into Eq. (23), and the Hilbert transform fort1=0sandt2=1.0sis represented in Fig. 3(b). Where the other two Hilbert transforms are obtained using Eq. (28), one for a non-periodic single rectangular signal as shown in Fig. 3(a) and the other considering the rectangular signal as a periodic function.It is clearly observed that the Hilbert transform obtained using the discrete FT and IFT shows the totally different curve from the analytically derived one near the end of time period. But, the Hilbert transform obtained by the discrete FT and IFT exactly coincides with one of the periodic rectangular signal, justifying that non-periodic signals are regarded as a periodic one when their analytic signals are numerically obtained by FT and IFT. Therefore, the numerical approach to obtain the analytic signalfa(t)using Eq. (28) cannot be used without extra numerical treatment, because the numerically obtained Hilbert transform showing the discrepant signal near the end of time period leads to the incorrect time response for the hysteretic damping system. In the current study, a Hilbert transform superposition method is introduced to overcome this problem. This method is motivated by the fact that the analytically derived Hilbert transform does not produce the above-mentioned problem and an arbitrary impulse signal can be decomposed into a finite number of well-defined impulse signals.Referring toFig. 4, let us denoteD(t)be the discrete impulse function off(t)which is defined by(30)D(t)=∑k=1n−1Dk(t),Dk(t)=hk(tk≤t≤tk+1)using a finite number of rectangular impulsesDk(t). SubstitutingD(t)into Eq. (23), one can easily derive the Hilbert transformH[D(t)]given by(31)H[D(t)]=1π(h1ln|t−t1t−t2|+h2ln|t−t2t−t3|+⋯+hn−1ln|t−tn−1t−tn|)The basic property of a natural logarithmic function allows us to rewrite Eq. (31) as follows:(32)H[D(t)]=1π∑i=1ndiln|t−ti|whered1=h1,dn=−hn−1anddi=hi−hi−1(i=2,3,…,n−1). Note that the value oftattiis replaced with the mean oftiandti+1in order to preventln|t−ti|from becoming infinity.Fig. 5 shows the Hilbert transforms of rectangular and triangular impulse signals using the Hilbert transform superposition withn−1=2000for rectangular impulse andn−1=3000for triangular impulse, where the above mentioned problem shown in Fig. 3 of the conventional Hilbert transform near the end of time period completely disappears. For the current study, thanks to this feature of the Hilbert transform superposition, the analytic signalfa(t)of real applied forcef(t)is generated by combining the original real-valued applied forcef(t)and its imaginary-valued transformed signalf^(t)which is obtained by the Hilbert transform superposition.Another point to be considered for Hilbert transform is that the imaginary partf^(t)may not be zero even at the time when the real impulse signalf(t)starts with zero value, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b). There is no doubt that such an analytic impulse signalfa(t)leads to the incorrect damped time response of structural dynamic system, so the time duration of analytic impulse forcefa(t)which is based on the real partf(t)should be adjusted. In other words, the time duration of analytic impulse force should be extended so that the imaginary partf^(t)reasonably approaches zero value. Referring toFig. 6, the time duration[t0L,t0R]which is set based on the real partf(t)should be extended in both the negative and positive time directions, where the time duration extension is made by the Newton–Raphson iteration based on the fact that Hilbert transform conserves the magnitude of an original real impulse signal.The time duration is extended equally in the negative and positive time directions, and let[ti+1L,ti+1R]be the time duration to be determined at the next Newton–Raphson iterationi+1. Then, it can be expressed in an iterative linearized form given by(33)ti+1I=tiI−f^(tiI)f^′(tiI),i=0,1,2,…(I=L,R)withf^′(tiI)being the slope of imaginary impulse force at timetiI. In addition, let us introduce the residualReidefined by(34)Rei=INi(f(t))−INi(H[f(t)])at iteration stagei, where(35)INi(f(t))=∫tiLtiR|f(t)|2dt,INi(H[f(t)])=∫tiLtiR|H[f(t)]|2dtThe residual means the difference in squared area between the original real functionf(t)and the transformed imaginary onef^(t).The flowchart for the iterative calculation of the extended time duration is represented inFig. 7, where the termination of iteration is judged by two values,|df^/dt|and|Rei/Rei−1|. The convergence toleranceεfis successively reduced from 1.0 until another toleranceεris satisfied.The numerical method for estimating the extend time duration is applied to the rectangular impulse shown in Fig. 5(a) with the time durationt∈[0,2]. By adjusting the slope|df/dt|from 1.0 to 0.0001, the extended time duration, the total number of iterations,Re/IN(H[f])andRei+1/Reiare investigated, as given inTable 1. It is observed that the relative residualRe/IN(H[f])and the residual ratioRei+1/Reishow uniform decrease and uniform increase and approach 2.0% and 100%, respectively. On the other hand, the total number of iterations and the extended time duration dramatically increase in proportional to|df/dt|. Owing to the asymmetric distribution off^(t)with respect to the time axis, the total numbers of iterations in the negative and positive time directions are different.The saturation trend ofRe/IN(H[f])to|df^/dt|is clearly observed inFig. 8. There is no doubt that the analytic external force with longer extended time duration provides us more accurate time response of complex structural dynamic problem, but the total CPU time required for the time domain analysis becomes a burden. In this context, the choice of appropriate extended time duration should be made by considering these two conflicting aspects. Restricted to the convergence characteristic of the relative residualRe/IN(H[f]), the tolerancesεffor|df^/dt|andεrforRei+1/Reiare suggested to be lower than 0.001 and greater than 98%, respectively.We next apply the proposed time-duration extended Hilbert transform superposition to five-layered damped sandwich beam to analyze the time response to impulse force. Fig. 8(b) shows a fixed–fixed asymmetric five-layered damped sandwich beam subject to a double half sine impulse shown inFig. 9(a) at the center. The material properties of aluminum and rubber layers are given inTable 2, and the sandwich beam is uniformly discretized with 17 damped beam elements presented in Section 2. The loss factorηfor rubber layers is set by 0.2, and the damped time response of the beam is taken at the point where the impulse force is applied.Fig. 9(a) represents the Hilbert transform of double half sine by the superposition method explained in Section 4.1 before the extension of time durationt∈[0,0.05]. It is observed that the transformed imaginary signal has non-vanishing negative force att=0s, and this sudden non-vanishing imaginary force at the beginning will produce the incorrect time response of the beam. Fig. 9(b) shows the Hilbert transform of double half sine when the time duration is extended. Two tolerancesεfandεrfor|df^/dt|andRei+1/Reiwhich are required for the iterative estimation of time duration are set by 0.001 and 99.9%, respectively. The time duration is extended as follows:t=0sis extended tot=−0.3046sin the negative direction whilet=0.05sis tot=0.3382sin the positive direction. The time axis is adjusted such thatt=−0.3046sbecomes the initial time, and the final extended time duration becomest∈[0,0.6428]. And, the time domain analysis is carried out by the time-reversal technique in the mode superposition approach, for which the initial conditions{w,θ,γ2,γ4}t=0={0,0,0,0}are specified att=0s.The damped time responses of beam deflection at the point where the impulse force is applied are compared inFig. 10(a), where IFT indicates the numerical solution obtained by taking inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response. Two solutions are in excellent agreement such that it is hard to find the difference. Fig. 10(b) compares the time responses obtained by the Hilbert transform superposition with and without the time duration extension. It is clearly observed that the Hilbert transform superposition without the time duration extension shows unstable growth aftert=0.34s, which is because the non-vanishing imaginary impulse force is suddenly applied at the beginning. Thus, it has been justified that the Hilbert transform superposition with time duration extension successfully provides us a stable decaying time response of complex structural dynamics which is consistent with the solution obtained by IFT.As described in Section 4.1, the external impulse load is discretized into a finite number of rectangular impulses for the present method, but such a representation using piecewise constant functions may produce the discrete Hilbert transform far from the exact one when the shape of external impulse load is not rectangular but arbitrary. In order to investigate the influence of this subject on the present time analysis method, let us consider a double triangle impulse load shown inFig. 11(a). Referring to the previous Fig. 4, let us discretize the impulse load in two different ways, one is the present division into a finite number of rectangular impulses and the other is the piecewise linear interpolation. In the latter case, the discrete Hilbert transformH[D(t)]is derived as(36)H[D(t)]=h1−hn+1π∑i=1nd(t)iln|t−ti|withd(t)ibeing the ith piecewise linear function betweenti−1andti. One can realize that Eq. (36) is different from Eq. (32) for the case when the external impulse load is divided into rectangular impulses. Fig. 11(b) comparatively represents the discrete Hilbert transforms of the double triangle impulse load when the time intervaldtis set by0.01s. It is observed that the discrete Hilbert transform obtained by the linear interpolation method is much closer to the exact one. But, the difference between two methods significantly diminishes as the time interval becomes smaller, such that the transformed signals obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement with the exact one whendtreaches0.0001s, as shown inFig. 12.Next, the difference in the time responses of damped sandwich beam between the present rectangular impulse superposition and the piecewise linear interpolation is investigated. The fixed–fixed five-layered damped sandwich beam shown in Fig. 8(b) is also taken, where the loss factorηand the thicknesses of five layers are changed to 0.1 and10.5mm(1, 1, 6, 2 and 0.5mm from the top layer) respectively. The time duration of impulse load is extended because the transformed imaginary impulse signals start with non-vanishing negative values att=0s. Two tolerancesεfandεrfor|df^/dt|andRei+1/Reirequired for the iterative extension of time duration are set by 0.001 and 99.9%, respectively, as in the previous case for the double half sine impulse. The transformed impulse signals shown in Fig. 12 which were obtained withdt=0.001and0.0001sare taken for the time response analyses, because the time intervals larger than0.001sproduce the discrete Hilbert transforms far from the exact one. For the both time intervals, the total iteration numbers for the time duration extension were 14 for the present rectangular impulse superposition and 21 for the piecewise linear interpolation. Meanwhile, for both signal discretization methods, the extended time durations are as follows:−0.149≤t≤0.187fordt=0.001sand−0.113≤t≤0.298fordt=0.0001s. Thus, it has been observed that the total iteration number becomes larger for the piecewise linear interpolation and the extended time duration increases as the time interval becomes smaller.The damped time responses of beam deflection at the point where the impulse force is applied are compared inFig. 13, where the extended time durations were adjusted so that the time response starts fromt=0s. The difference in the time responses between two methods is observed atdt=0.001s, particularly in the amplitudes, but it almost completely disappears when the transformed signals obtained usingdtof0.0001sare applied. Thus, the present method using the rectangular impulse superposition can not only produce the consistent discrete Hilbert transform for non-constant arbitrary impulse forces, but it can also lead to the accurate time response of the damped sandwich beam when the time discretization interval is sufficiently small.
