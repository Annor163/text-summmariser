@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been increasingly gaining concerns, as they make it accessible to those untouchable areas for human beings and assist with complex and arduous ocean tasks. AUVs are untethered and intelligent mobile platforms [1]. In many scenarios like target tracking [2], AUV-aid localization [3], and demining etc., AUVs need accurate localization for the accuracy of the gathered data [4]. And due to tough underwater conditions and technical restrictions, to localize a moving AUV is still challenging and needs more complementary researches.Since the global position system (GPS) cannot work underwater because of bad attenuation of radio frequency (RF) signals, the inertial navigation system (INS) is mostly applied on AUVs. INS suffers from error accumulation. High-quality INS is however greatly expensive and can only provide relative locations. Overall, it is a better and available scheme to take advantage of acoustic communication for AUVs self-localization [5].Acoustic localization system for AUVs includes long baseline (LBL), short baseline (SBL) and ultra-short baseline (USBL). Compared with SBL and USBL, LBL is more cost-effective [4]. In LBL, AUVs communicates with one or more transponders fixed on the seabed to measure range information and achieve self-localization. One-way ranging is mostly based on time of arrival (ToA) and time difference of arrival (TDoA). ToA needs strict time-synchronization, which is energy-intensive and hard to achieve. Multiple-node cooperation in TDoA [6,7] increases cost and is computationally complex. The round-trip ranging (RTR) technology [8] is frustrated by the long propagation delay and AUVs’ mobility. In RTR, the two-way travel time (TWTT) between the AUV and a transponder is halved as the one-way travel time (OWTT), which is the propagation delay of acoustic signals traveling from the AUV to a transponder or the opposite case. Consequently the ranging error is increased since the AUV has sailed away from where it signals. But many approaches ignored this e.g. [6,7,9]. Moreover, the underwater sound speed is no constant but varies with salinity, temperature and depth [10], which adds uncertainty of location estimates.To solve these problems stated above, we propose a self-localization algorithm with accurate sound travel time solution (SL-STTS) for AUVs in shallow water (depth < 500 m). SL-STTS is time-synchronization free. The ranging accuracy relies on precise time measurement. It is accessible in microsecond resolution with seabed transponders [11] whose locations are known in advance with some technologies e.g. [12]. Orientation for the AUV and angle of arrival (AoA) for acoustic signals from transponders are analyzed to calculate the OWTT. As we know, the error of OWTT estimation in milliseconds may cause error of distance estimation in meters, which weakens localization accuracy. So it's indispensable to work out a high performance sound travel time solution. We model the function relating the distance estimates to the location vector of AUV. The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) [13] is utilized to optimize the distance estimates.Our main contribution is as follows. First, the time-synchronization free scheme is presented which saves energy used for frequent two-way packet exchange in the time-synchronization ones. Second, the accurate sound travel time solution is proposed which improves ranging and localization accuracy. Third, we analyze the mathematical expectation of underwater sound speed, employ it for distance estimation and further analyze the rationality in theory. Fourth, we employ the LMA in solving the non-linear least squares optimization problem and localizing the AUV. SL-STTS can also be used in recalibrating the INS without resurfacing.A reminder of this paper presents as follows: the related work are reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 gives an overview of the proposed algorithm and expatiates on how an AUV localizes itself. The performance of our algorithm is discussed in Section 4. Next a conclusion and the future efforts are summarized in Section 5.
