Mobile devices at the cinema theatre

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We developed a highly engaging interactive game designed for the cinema theatre.The game runs with a very low footprint – a simple browser running on the movie-goer’s smartphone.The game offers a socially engaging experience that is scalable–from 2 to 100 movie-goers.This research shed lights on designing and developing multiplayer real-time cinema games.

The pre-show experience is a significant part of the movie industry. Moviegoers, on average arrive 24min before when the previews start. Previews have been a part of the movie experience for more than a hundred years and are a culturally significant aspect of the whole experience. Over the last decade, the pre-movie in-theatre experience has grown to a $600 million industry. This growth continues to accelerate. Since 2012, this industry has increased by 150%. Consequently, there is an industry-wide demand for innovation in the pre-movie area. In this paper, we describe Paths, an innovative multiplayer real-time socially engaging game that we designed, developed and evaluated. An iterative refinement application development methodology was used to create the game. The game may be played on any smartphone and group interactions are viewed on the large theatre screen. This paper also reports on the quasi-experimental mixed method study with repeated measures that was conducted to ascertain the effectiveness of this new game. The results show that Paths is very engaging with elements of suspense, pleasant unpredictability and effective team building and crowd-pleasing characteristics.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The pre-show period in the film industry is widely recognized as a good opportunity for advertising. Theatregoers often arrive early to see a movie and furthermore, there are few distractions once they are settled in their seats. This captive audience setting is what advertising companies aim to capitalize on to reach and influence as many attendees as possible [1]. However, an increasing number of moviegoers are becoming dissatisfied and disengaged during the pre-feature period, partly due to the fact that they are aware of their captive status [2,3]. For example, patrons may choose to use their smartphones instead of watching the pre-show or decide to not even go to the theatre at all. Patrons are very aware of the diversity of entertainment options available. In fact, many theatregoers have home theatre environments that negatively influence their movie-going behaviour [4,5].Movie theatres have a challenge to provide additional value that leverages the social properties of cinema attendance [6,7]. However, now is the right time for the pre-show period to harness the opportunity of social networking and personal interactive technologies [7]. The pre-show period can be reshaped to provide a socially enticing and personally engaging experience instead of driving theatregoers away [4,8,9].The goal of this research was to create a multiplayer real-time socially engaging game for cinema theatres. An important design requirement was to support all of the major smartphone models currently on the market to facilitate accurately reflecting the reality of the movie-going population. The research plan included the creation of a smartphone app (client) and game server using a rigorous design, development and agile refinement process. The final research objective was to assess the effectiveness of this game using a rigorous scientific method involving a quasi-experimental mixed method study with repeated measures.
