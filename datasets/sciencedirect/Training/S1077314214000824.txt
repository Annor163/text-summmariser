@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The core problem addressed in this article is the 3D position detection of a spherical object of known-radius in a single image frame, obtained by a dioptric vision system consisting of only one fisheye lens camera that follows equidistant projection model. The central contribution is a bijection principle between a known-radius spherical object’s 3D world position and its 2D projected image curve, that we prove, thus establishing that for every possible 3D world position of the spherical object, there exists a unique curve on the image plane if the object is projected through a fisheye lens that follows equidistant projection model. Additionally, we present a setup for the experimental verification of the principle’s correctness. In previously published works we have applied this principle to detect and subsequently track a known-radius spherical object.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this article we proposed a bijection principle which states that the 3D position of a spherical object of known radius, when projected onto an image through a fisheye lens-based camera following equidistant projection model, can be uniquely determined using only a single image frame. We presented a detailed mathematical proof for this principle which is the central contribution of this work. In order to verify the bijection principle’s correctness as well as applicability in detecting spherical objects in 3D, we presented experiments to detect and track a soccer ball of known radius through a robot consisting of a single, fisheye lens-based camera. The experiments were performed under different environmental conditions, e.g., lighting conditions, occlusion densities, etc. Results highlight the accuracy and precision of tracking, which in turn experimentally verify the bijection principle and signify its practical utility. On the other hand, it must be noted that the errors in tracking occurred due to various uncontrollable factors, such as, low resolution of the camera (caused reduced visibility of the object when it is moved far from the camera), and imperfect color segmentation method involved within the detection process. These errors are not related to the bijection principle itself, which is a purely mathematical concept. Moreover, the experiments presented in this paper were in addition to the ones in our previous works where we have successfully tested detection and tracking of spherical objects in 3D using this bijection principle.Our ongoing and future work w.r.t. the detection techniques in 3D include algorithms to detect generic objects with more complex 3D geometry than that of spheres. Applying a similar idea of bijection to objects than need to be described in a higher dimensional space is one of the directions which we intend to explore. Another aspect that we are currently investigating involves using this bijection principle to study the change in the object’s projection geometry during motion blur. Furthermore, we also intend to explore the possibility of characterizing motion models of randomly moving spherical targets using the 3D sphere detection.Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2014.04.004.
