@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We have grown the crystals of two thiophene/phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs) composed of in-line five and seven alternating thiophene and benzene rings. These TPCOs are characterized by thiophenes located at both molecular terminals. The grown crystals had several pairs of parallel crystal faces that function as optical resonators. These produced interference fringes in their emission and reflectance spectra. We measured the emission spectra in both weak broadband excitation and intense laser excitation regimes. From these spectra we determined the phase refractive index dispersion and the anisotropic group refractive indices. We made field-effect transistor devices using the above TPCO crystals and carried out their electrical measurements. These optical and charge transport properties are compared with those of crystals of other alternating TPCOs with phenylenes located at both molecular terminals.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Crystals of organic semiconductor materials are increasingly attracting attention as promising materials for high performance optoelectronic devices. These crystals combine high fluorescence quantum yield [1–3] and high carrier mobilities [4]. These properties are due to the regular molecular alignments in the crystals. Making the most of these characteristics, researchers recently started applying the organic semiconductor crystals to e.g. light-emitting field-effect transistors (LEFETs) [5]. The organic semiconductor crystals also exhibit optically-excited spectrally-narrowed emissions (SNEs) [1,6,7]. Amongst the organic semiconductor crystals, furthermore, those of thiophene/phenylene co-oligomers (TPCOs) [8–10] show longitudinal multimode laser oscillations under optical excitations [11–14].The refractive index and its dispersion are important parameters for applying the materials to the optoelectronic devices. In this connection we have developed useful methods to determine the dispersions and anisotropic group refractive indices of the organic crystals [12,15]. To do this we used pairs of parallel crystal facets acting as Fabry–Pérot resonators, and observed the interference fringes in the emission and reflectance spectra. In the emission spectra the fringes can clearly be seen with both a weak broadband excitation and intense laser excitation regimes. On the basis of the above methods, we have determined the dispersions and anisotropic group refractive indices of several TPCO crystals [12,15,16].The aforementioned situation motivated us to further explore optoelectronic properties of a wider variety of organic semiconductors, particularly TPCOs. In the present studies we chose two alternating TPCOs having thiophene moieties at both molecular terminals; i.e. 2,5-bis[4-(2-thienyl)phenyl]thiophene (AC′5) [9] and 1,4-bis{5-[4-(2′-thienyl)phenyl]thiophen-2-yl}benzene (AC7) [10]; see Fig. 1for their structural formulae. We have determined the dispersions and anisotropic refractive indices of these crystals. We also made field-effect transistor (FET) devices using them and carried out their electrical measurements. We compare these results with those reported for other alternating TPCO analogs having phenylenes at both molecular terminals, i.e. 1,4-bis(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)benzene (AC5) [8] and 2,5-bis[4-(5′-phenylthiophen-2′-yl)phenyl]thiophene (AC′7) [10]. Fig. 1 includes their structural formulae.AC′5 and AC7 crystals were grown in a vapor phase [17]. As an option we choked the growth apparatus with silica wool to reduce carrier gas flow. For the AC′5 (AC7) crystal growth, we set the temperatures of the source heater at 270–280°C (350–380°C) and the growth heater at 230–240°C (300–340°C). The growth time was 9–20h. For measurements we manually laminated the crystals on silicon wafer substrates covered with a silicon oxide layer of 300nm in thickness. Additionally, AC′5 crystals were grown directly on the substrates in a liquid phase [18]. We used ortho-dichlorobenzene as a solvent and an aluminum plate as a radiator. We kept a mixture of AC′5 powder and its solution at 80°C for 430h for crystal growth.Fig. 2shows AC′5 and AC7 crystals. Their images disappeared at the extinction positions of the crossed Nicols of the polarizing microscope observations [17,18]. A pair of parallel edge facets constitutes a Fabry-Pérot resonator (i.e. reflecting mirrors). This produced interference fringes in the emission or reflectance spectrum. The crystals in Fig. 2a and c were used for the emission measurements. In these figures, L indicates horizontal resonator lengths (62.1μm for AC′5 and 229.0μm for AC7). The top and bottom wide planes parallel to the substrate surface constituted another vertical resonator. Their separations (i.e., thicknesses d) were 1.05μm for AC′5 in Fig. 2b and 1.40μm for AC7 in Fig. 2d. These were used for the reflectance measurements. We determined the crystal sizes (ranging from 205 to 1663μm) and thicknesses (from 370nm to 1.40μm) using the microscope and a surface profiler, respectively [12,16]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in the manner same as before [18].We measured the emission and reflectance spectra using the reported setups and procedures [12,15,16]. We irradiated the incident lights perpendicularly to the wide crystal planes. For the emission measurements, we used as the excitation unpolarized violet light (380–420nm) arising from a mercury lamp (white light: 294.5–812.5nm) in combination with an excitation filter. Using a monochromator spectrograph (SOLAR TII, MS7504) we observed the spectra parallel to the crystal plane and perpendicular to the pair of the facets (see Fig. 2a and c) [12,16]. In contrast, we detected the reflected light (450–800nm or 500–800nm) from the crystals using a photonic multi-channel analyzer (Hamamatsu Photonics, PMA-11 C7473-36) in the opposite direction of the incident white light [15,16]. We measured the spectra polarized along either the A- or P-direction shown in Fig. 2b and d.We also carried out the laser light excitation measurements using the same setup reported previously [11,12,16]. The horizontal resonators of the crystals were used for the measurements. We used the monochromator spectrograph and the photonic multi-channel analyzer for high- and low-resolution measurements, respectively. The wavelength of the excitation laser was set at 422nm.Bottom-contact type FETs were fabricated by laminating the vapor-phase-grown crystals onto pairs of comb-shaped interdigitated source and drain electrodes that were preliminarily-prepared on the substrates. These electrodes were composed of the layered chromium (5nm in thickness) and gold (100nm). We also fabricated a top-contact type AC7 crystal device. We spin-coated 5wt% toluene solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (3000rpm, 30s) on the substrate. The resulting PMMA layer was 275nm in thickness. We laminated the crystal on it and deposited gold to form the source and drain contacts [19]. The channel lengths and widths of all devices ranged 10–50μm and 0.63–13.00mm, respectively.We measured the output characteristics in vacuum of ∼10–3Pa in the hole-enhancement mode by applying direct-current (DC) voltages ranging from 0 to −60 (or −100) V and from 0 to −60 (or −70) V to the drain and gate contacts, respectively [20]. We grounded one of the metal electrodes as the source contact following the standard method [21]. The Si was used for the gate contact.We carried out molecular orbital (MO) calculations using the Gaussian 09 program [22]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to optimize the geometry and estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies using the B3LYP method with 6-31G(d) basis set. These energies for AC5 and AC′7 were found in the literature [20,23]. We calculated the polarizability tensor with the optimized molecular geometries from 500 to 750nm using the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP) [24].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have grown the crystals of two alternating TPCOs, AC′5 and AC7. These molecules were characterized by thiophenes located at both molecular terminals. Using these crystals we have determined their dispersions and anisotropic refractive indices. We also made field-effect transistor (FET) devices using these crystals and carried out their electrical measurements. We compared the results with those for other alternating TPCO analogs AC5 and AC′7. Analyzing the interference fringes in the emission and reflectance spectra, we determined the refractive index dispersion along the direction perpendicular to the flat crystal plane and estimated the other two anisotropic group indices in the directions parallel to the wide crystal plane. The dispersion curves are separated as a whole into two sets of upper and lower curves; i.e. those of AC7 and AC′7 along with those of AC′5 and AC5.The maximum mobility of AC7 (0.091cm2/Vs) was comparable with that of AC′7 (0.098cm2/Vs). The experimental results of the refractive indices and charge transport on the FET devices mean that both the thiophene-terminated TPCOs and the phenylene-terminated TPCOs exhibit related properties when they have the same total ring number. This can be explained by the similar HOMO and LUMO energies of both the types of TPCOs. Thus the present studies add a different class of TPCOs; i.e. the thiophene-terminated compounds as useful optoelectronic materials.
