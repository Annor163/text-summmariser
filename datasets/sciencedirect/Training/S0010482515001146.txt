@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, mathematical simulation of bioheat transfer phenomenon within the living tissue is studied using the thermal wave model. Three different sources that have therapeutic applications in laser surgery, cornea laser heating and cancer hyperthermia are used. Spatial and transient heating source, on the skin surface and inside biological body, are considered by using step heating, sinusoidal and constant heating. Mathematical simulations describe a non-Fourier process. Exact solution for the corresponding non-Fourier bioheat transfer model that has time lag in its heat flux is proposed using strongly continuous semigroup theory in conjunction with variational methods. The abstract differential equation, infinitesimal generator and corresponding strongly continuous semigroup are proposed. It is proved that related semigroup is a contraction semigroup and is exponentially stable. Mathematical simulations are done for skin burning and thermal therapy in 10 different models and the related solutions are depicted. Unlike numerical solutions, which suffer from uncertain physical results, proposed analytical solutions do not have unwanted numerical oscillations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, temperature predictions for living tissues have great attraction due to its significance in basic and clinical sciences. The thermal wave model of bioheat transfer in living tissues reduces to one differential equation (for example see: [1,2]). Although this phenomenon is three-dimensional (3D), for many researchers the depth effects of the heat propagation is a matter of importance. Thus, without loss of generality, one can assume the heat energy propagation along the direction perpendicular to the skin surface. Liu et al. [3] introduced the thermal wave model to investigate physical mechanisms and the behaviours in living tissues. Traditionally, finite difference, boundary element and finite element methods are used [4–8] to model and solve different bioheat transfer problems numerically. However, if both closed form analytical and numerical solutions exist, the analytical one is preferred, since it does not depend on the dimensions of the problem. Moreover, in contrast to numerical solutions the analytical solutions are not depended on the previous grids in the domain. But for most of the numerical solutions of thermal wave model there are oscillations that are hard to dampen [9–11] and these solutions are physically doubtful results for the temperature prediction at the pulse surface heat flux. It is for these reasons that we aimed in this paper to present several closed form analytical solutions to the thermal wave model of bioheat transfer under different types of boundary conditions. Up to now, Haji-Sheikh et al. described a method of solution of the thermal wave equation in finite bodies using Green׳s functions [12]. Ahmadikia et al. [13–15] derived the solution of the hyperbolic heat equation using the Laplace transform. This paper deals with the closed analytical form solution of the thermal wave equation based on strongly continuous semigroup (C0-semigroup) theory. Proposed general solutions in this paper work for different kinds of source terms. Therefore, they are flexible in calculating the temperature distribution for various practical problems in skin burning and hyperthermia. Furthermore, the C0-semigroup solution is capable to dealing with the transient or space-dependent boundary conditions. In the recent years, Malek et al. [16,17] have performed several closed forms of analytical solutions for Pennes׳ and dual phase lag equation using C0-semigroup theory. By semigroup theory, an infinitesimal generator is used to establish the abstract differential equation related to the original thermal wave equation. The main results consist of computing eigenvalues and proof for the well-posedness of related operator. It is proved that an infinitesimal generator is Riesz spectral operator and the corresponding system is exponentially stable.The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 mathematics formulation for thermal wave equation under generalized boundary conditions are described. In Section 3 semigroup formulation and closed analytical form solution are achieved. The mathematical simulation results based on semigroup theories derived for four different boundary conditions in Section 4. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.In order to study thermal behaviour in living tissues, several models describing bioheat transfer have been developed [18]. Most of the thermal medical practices are based on the well-known Pennes׳ equation. It is based on an infinitely fast propagation of temperature disturbance (Fourier׳s law). In contrast with Fourier׳s constitutive law, a modified flux model based on the finite speed of propagation of heat in the living body was suggested [19,20]. The assumption of finite speed wave propagation does not obey in the classical Fourier׳s law. The thermal wave theory based on non-Fourier׳s law can be derived from(1)q(r→,t+τq)=−k∇T(r→,t)where t is the time, k is the thermal conductivity, q is the heat flux,∇Tis the temperature gradient,r→=(x,y,z)is three-dimensional position vector in which z stands for the tissue depth. The relaxation time isτq=α/C2where α is the thermal diffusivity and C stands for the heat propagation velocity. In contrast with common metals the relaxation time for heating processes is much longer than 10−8s [10]. For the processed meat Mitra et al. [21] tookτq=15s, while in Refs. [22,23] it is shown that τqis in the range of 20–30s for biological bodies. Pennes׳ bioheat transfer equation is [24](2)−∇q+wbcb(Tb−T)+Qm+Qr=ρc∂T∂t.Here, ρ, c and T denote density, specific heat and temperature of tissue, respectively. cband wbare the specific heat and perfusion rate of blood respectively. Qmis the metabolic heat generation and Qris the heat source for spatial heating. Tbis the arterial temperature and was regarded as a constant. Applying the first-order Taylor׳s series expansion to Eq. (1) leads to(3)q(r→,t)+τq∂q(r→,t)∂t=−k∇T(r→,t).By taking the gradient with respect to r on both sides of (3) and substitute in (2) one can write(4)∇·(k∇T)+wbcb(Tb−T)+Qm+Qr+τq(−wbcb∂T∂t+∂Qm∂t+∂Qr∂t)=ρc(τq∂2T∂t2+∂T∂t).This hyperbolic heat transfer equation is more complicated than Pennes׳ equation (2) since forτq=0, Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (2). For constant thermal parametersk,Qmthe z-direction form of Eq. (4) is(5)k∂2T∂z2+wbcb(Tb−T)+Qm+Qr+τq(−wbcb∂T∂t+∂Qr∂t)=ρc(τq∂2T∂t2+∂T∂t).In order to solve this equation we take(6)T(z,0)=T0(z)and∂T(z,t)∂t|t=0=0,in whichT0(z)for everyz∈[0,l]is the solution of the following ordinary differential equation [25]:(7)kd2T0(z)dz2+wbcb(Tb−T0(z))+Qm=0−kdT0(z)dz=h0(Tf−T0(z)),z=0,T0(z)=Tc,z=l,whereT(z,0)=T0(z)is the initial heat value at starting, Tfis the ambient temperature, h0 is the coefficient corresponding to the ambient and skin surface temperature and Tcis the body core temperature at z=l. The closed form analytical solution for Eq. (7) can be written as(8)T0(z)=Tb+Qmwbcb+(Tc−Tb−Qmwbcb)[Acosh(Az)+h0ksinh(Az)]Acosh(Al)+h0ksinh(Al)+h0k(Tf−Tb−Qmwbcb)sinh(A(l−z))Acosh(Al)+h0ksinh(Al),whereA=wbcb/k.In practice, different types of boundary conditions (BCs) may be considered with Eq. (5) and initial conditions (6): (a) a transient surface heat flux, (b) a surface and body core heating, (c) a cooling medium on tissue surface, (d) a surface heating with body core heat flux, which can be generalized as(9a)−k∂T(z,t)∂z|z=0=f0(t),T(l,t)=Tc,(9b)T(0,t)=f1(t),T(l,t)=Tc,(9c)−k∂T(z,t)∂z|z=0=hf(f2(t)−T(0,t)),T(l,t)=Tc,(9d)T(0,t)=f1(t),∂T(z,t)∂z|z=l=0,wheref0(t)andf1(t)are the time-dependent surface heat flux and the temperature at the skin surface respectively. Expressions forf0(t)andf1(t)will be defined according to the different heating style (see Fig. 1). In BC (9c),f2(t)is time-dependent temperature for cooling medium and hfis the heat convection coefficient between the medium and the skin surface. For BCs (9a)–(9c) the body core temperature was regarded as a constant Tc, considering that the biological body tends to keep its core temperature to be stable. In BC (9d) it is assumed that heat flux vanishes for z=l. In the next section it is proved that the initial boundary value problem (5) and (6) with one of the BCs (9a)–(9d) leads to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of bounded linear operator on the specific Hilbert space.DefineT(z,t)=u(z,t)+v(z,t)wherev(z,t)satisfies one of the BCs (9a)–(9d). Thenu(z,t)can be written as(10)(ρcτq∂2∂t2+(ρc+τqwbcb)∂∂t+wbcb−k∂2∂z2)u(z,t)=(1+τq∂∂t)Qr(z,t)+(−ρcτq∂2∂t2−(ρc+τqwbcb)∂∂t+k∂2∂z2−wbcb)v(z,t)+Qm+wbcbTb,for the following initial conditions:(11)u(z,0)=T0(z)−v(z,0),∂u(z,t)∂t|t=0=−∂v(z,t)∂t|t=0,with one of the boundary conditions:(12a)∂u(z,t)∂z|z=0=0,u(l,t)=0,(12b)u(0,t)=0,u(l,t)=0,(12c)k∂u(z,t)∂z|z=0=hfu(0,t),u(l,t)=0,(12d)u(0,t)=0,∂u(z,t)∂z|z=l=0.In order to solve this PDE, we need to study some lemma and theorems.Lemma 1Consider the operator A0onL2(0,l)as(13)A0h=−ατqd2hdz2+wbcbρcτqh,with domain(14)D(A0)={h∈L2(0,l)|handdhdzareabsolutelycontinuous,d2hdz2∈L2(0,l)andhsatisfiesinoneoftheBCs(12a)–(12d)},andα=k/ρc. Then operator A0is self-adjoint, positive and boundedly invertible.Forh1∈D(A0)andh2∈L2(0,l)one may use integration by parts to write〈A0h1,h2〉L2(0,l)=〈−ατqd2h1dz2+wbcbρcτqh1,h2〉L2(0,l)=[dh1dzh2−h1dh2dz]0l+∫0lh1(−ατqd2h2dz2+wbcbρcτqh2)dz.This can be written in the form〈h1,A0h2〉if and only ifh2∈D(A0)thus A0 is self-adjoint. It can be shown that for all non-zeroh∈D(A0), A0 is positive, i.e.,(15)〈A0h,h〉L2(0,l)=ατq〈dhdz,dhdz〉L2(0,l)+wbcbρcτq〈h,h〉L2(0,l)>0.From (15), it follows that A0 is coercive, i.e.,(16)〈A0h,h〉L2(0,l)≥wbcbρcτq‖h‖L2(0,l)2forallh∈D(A0),this shows that A0 is injective. Surjectivity is implied byran(A0)=(kerA0⁎)⊥=(kerA0)⊥, thus A0 is invertible and bounded from the ‘Closed Graph Theorem’. Forξ∈ranA0, from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality we have‖A0−1ξ‖2≤ρcτqwbcb〈A0A0−1ξ,A0−1ξ〉L2(0,l)≤ρcτqwbcb∥ξ∥∥A0−1ξ∥.Thus∥A0−1ξ∥≤ρcτqwbcb∥ξ∥and A0 is boundedly invertible.□From positivity property of A0 the square rootA012exists. Thus, the spaceH=D(A012)⊕L2(0,l)with the inner product(17)〈u,w〉H=〈A012u1,A012w1〉L2(0,l)+〈u2,w2〉L2(0,l),whereu=(u1u2)Tandw=(w1w2)Tdefines a Hilbert space. Recall that ifk∈D(A0), then〈A012k,A012h〉=〈A0k,h〉for everyh∈D(A012).In the following theorem, we show how to rewrite thermal wave model as an abstract differential equation. By abstract differential equation we forget the spatial dependence, and we write the PDE as (abstract) a system of ordinary differential equations [26].Theorem 1The problem(10) and (11)with one of the BCs(12a)–(12d)can be formulated as an inhomogeneous abstract differential equation(18){ddt(uut)=A(uut)+BQr(t)+Dv(t)+f(uut)|t=0=(T0−v(0)−∂v∂t(0))on the Hilbert space H with the inner product〈u,w〉H. Hereut=dudt,f=(0Qm+wbcbTb)Tand A with domainD(A)=D(A0)⊕D(A012), is a closed and densely defined operator on H as(19)A(u1u2)=(0I−A0−βI)(u1u2),where I is identity operator andβ=1τq(τqwbcbρc+1)and(20)BQr=(01τqρc(1+τq∂∂t))Qr,Dv=(0−∂2∂t2−β∂∂t−A0)v.It is similar to the proof of wave equation presented in Ref. [27].□Let A be the operator on Hilbert space H introduced in Theorem1. The adjoint of A on H withD(A⁎)=D(A)is given by(21)A⁎(w1w2)=(0−IA0−βI)(w1w2)The lemma is easily proved by using Lemma 1.□In the next theorem we show that A generates a contraction semigroup(S(t))t≥0on H; i.e.,∥S(t)∥≤1for everyt≥0.Theorem 2The operator A in(19)is the infinitesimal generator of a contraction C0-semigroup(S(t))t≥0on H.Forw∈D(A)we show that(22)Re(〈Aw,w〉H)=Re(〈A01/2w2,A01/2w1〉L2(0,l)+〈−A0w1−βw2,w2〉L2(0,l))=Re(〈A0w2,w1〉L2(0,l)+〈−A0w1−βw2,w2〉L2(0,l))=−β‖w2‖L2(0,l)2.Similarly, it can be shown that(23)Re(〈w,A⁎w〉H)=−β‖w2‖L2(0,l)2.Thus by Corollary 2.2.3 in Ref. [28], A is the infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup(S(t))t≥0on H. From (22) and (23), it follows that A and A⁎ are dissipative on H. Thus(S(t))t≥0is a contraction C0-semigroup from Lumer–Phillips Theorem [29].□In the following we find solution of the inhomogeneous abstract differential equation (18). We derive solution of (18) by showing that the normalized eigenfunctions of A form a Riesz basis in H. We begin by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of A. Since(24)A(u1u2)=λ(u1u2),then from (19) we can writeu2=λu1and−A0u1−βu2=λu2thus(25)(−ατq∂2∂z2+wbcbτqρc+λ(λ+β))u1=0foru1∈D(A0).Letu1∈{ϕn(z)}n=1∞be the sequence of functions onD(A0)defined in Table 1. Then Eq. (25) is equivalent to(26)λn2+βλn+1τq(αpn2+wbcbρc)=0,n=1,2,….In general, for every n this equation has two roots:(27)λ±n=−β2±(β2−1τq)2−(pnατq)2,n=1,2,….It is easy to see thatψ±n(z)=(ϕn(z)λ±nϕn(z))T,n=1,2,…lies in the domain of A and satisfiesAψ±n=λ±nψ±n. Henceψ±nandλ±nare corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of A. The simple eigenvalues{λ±n}n=1∞are unbounded and located on the vertical line−β/2except for a finite number real eigenvalues. One can easily see that the closure of{λ±n}n=1∞is totally disconnected.Lemma 3The eigenfunctions{ψ±n,n=1,2,…}forms an Riesz basis on Hilbert space H.The sequence of functions{ψ±n(z)}n=1∞is an orthogonal sequence with inner product〈.,.〉H. i.e.,〈ψ±n,ψ±m〉H={0ifm≠nl2(λ±n2+ατqpn2+wbcbρcτq)ifm=n〈ψn,ψ−n〉H=l2(λnλ−n+ατqpn2+wbcbρcτq).Fori=−1, define the linear operator L and XNasL(ϕn(z)±nπilϕn(z))=ψ±n,XN=∑n=−Nn≠0Nαn(ϕn(z)nπilϕn(z))for arbitraryN∈Nand arbitrary scalars αn(28)‖L(XN)‖H2=‖A01/2∑n=−Nn≠0Nαnϕn‖L22+‖∑n=−Nn≠0Nαnλnϕn‖L22=∑n=1N|αn+α−n|2〈ϕn,A0ϕn〉L2+∑n=1N|αnλn+α−nλ−n|2‖ϕn‖L22and(29)‖XN‖H2=‖A01/2∑n=−Nn≠0Nαnϕn‖L22+‖∑n=−Nn≠0Nαnnπilϕn‖L22=∑n=1N|αn+α−n|2〈ϕn,A0ϕn〉L2+∑n=1N|αn−α−n|2(nπl)2‖ϕn‖L22.Now, from (28) and (29), for sufficiently large values of n, one can write(30)|αnλn+α−nλ−n|2|αn−α−n|2(nπl)2→C≠0,since the numerator and the denominator are of order n2. Thus, for every N there exist positive constants m and M, such thatm∥XN∥≤∥L(XN)∥≤M∥XN∥. i.e.,m≤∥L∥≤M. Thus, L is bounded andL−1exists and it is bounded. Moreover, L is surjective, since the domain H is a Banach space. Therefore{ψ±n(z)}n=1∞is a Riesz basis. Note that a Riesz basis is the image of an orthogonal basis under an invertible linear bounded operator [28].□From Lemma 3 one can conclude that operator A in (19) is a Riesz-spectral operator with simple eigenvalues{λ±j}j=1∞and corresponding eigenfunctions{ψ±j(z)}j=1∞. A representation of operator A and its corresponding semigroup are established in the next theorem.Theorem 3Curtain and Zwart [28]The Riesz-spectral operator A in(19)satisfies(a)A has the representation(31)Ah=∑j=−∞j≠0∞λj〈h,ψj∥ψj∥〉ψj∥ψj∥forh∈D(A).A is the infinitesimal generator of a C0-semigroup(S(t))t≥0if and only ifsupj≥1Re(λ±j)<∞and(S(t))t≥0is given by(32)S(t)ξ=∑j=−∞j≠0∞eλjt〈ξ,ψj∥ψj∥〉ψj∥ψj∥The growth bound of the semigroup is given by(33)w0=inft>0(1tlog∥S(t)∥)=supj≥1Re(λ±j)See [28], Theorem 2.3.5.□From Theorem 3 solution(uut)Tfor inhomogeneous abstract differential equation (18) can be written as(34)(uut)=S(t)(T0(z)−v(z,0)−∂v(z,0)∂t)+∫0tS(t−s)(BQr(z,s)+Dv(z,s)+f)ds.LetQr(z,.),v(z,.)∈C1(0,tf)and(T0(z)−v(z,0)−∂v(z,0)∂t)T∈D(A01/2)⊕L2(0,l), we call (34) a strongly solution for (18). IfQr(z,.),v(z,.)∈H1(0,tf)(H1 is the Sobolev space) and(T0(z)−v(z,0)−∂v(z,0)∂t)T∈D(A012)⊕L2(0,l), we call (34) a mild solution for (18).Theorem 4Any arbitrary mild solution of abstract differential equation(18)can be written uniquely in the form(34).Any arbitrary(uut)Tas a mild solution of (18) must satisfy the integrated form of (18)(35)(u(t)ut(t))=(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))+∫0t(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds.ApplyingAS(−t)on the both sides and integrating yields∫0tAS(−s)(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))ds=∫0tAS(−s)(u(s)ut(s))ds−∫0tAS(−s)(∫0s(A(u(τ)ut(τ))+BQr(τ)+Dv(τ)+f)dτ)ds=∫0tAS(−s)(u(s)ut(s))ds+S(−t)∫0t(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds−∫0tS(−s)(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds=S(−t)∫0t(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds−∫0tS(−t)(BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)dsand−S(−t)(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))+(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))=S(−t)∫0t(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds−∫0tS(−s)(BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)dsApplying S(t) on the both sides yields−(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))+S(t)(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))=∫0t(A(u(s)ut(s))+BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds−S(t)∫0tS(−s)(BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds.From (35) one can write(u(t)ut(t))=S(t)(T0−v(0)−dvdt(0))+∫0tS(t−s)(BQr(s)+Dv(s)+f)ds,which proves the assertion.□Our next goal is to show(S(t))t≥0in (32) is exponentially stable, i.e., the solution for system (18) tends to zero exponentially fast ast→∞.Definition 1The C0-semigroup(S(t))t≥0on the Hilbert space H is exponentially stable if there exist positive constants M and α such that∥S(t)∥≤Mexp(−αt)fort≥0.The C0-semigroup(S(t))t≥0in(32)is exponentially stable.The coefficients of the quadratic equation (26) are positive, thus all solutions of (27) have negative real parts. The eigenvalues do not converge to zero sincew0=λ1of (33) is strictly smaller than zero. This proves the theorem.□The analytic solution (34) involves imaginary coefficientλj;j=±1,±2,…and it is not useful to depict the graphs numerically. In the next theorem separation of variables is used to give real expression for the complex expression (32).Theorem 6A series expression for the semigroup(S(t))t≥0described by(32)is equivalent to(36a)S(t)(u0u1)=e−(β/2)t(∑j=1∞(cjeγjt+dje−γjt)ϕj∑j=1∞(−cj(β2−γj)eγjt−dj(β2−γj)e−γjt)ϕj)for the case|2−τqβ|≥2pjατqwhile(36b)S(t)(u0u1)=e−(β/2)t×(∑j=1∞(ajcos(ωjt)+bjsin(ωjt))ϕj∑j=1∞((bjωj−β2aj)cos(ωjt)−(β2bj+ajωj)sin(ωjt))ϕj)for the case|2−τqβ|<2pjατqwhereγj=(β2−1τq)2−(pjατq)2,ωj=(pjατq)2−(β2−1τq)2,and(37)aj=〈u0,ϕj〉L2(0,l),bj=1ωj(〈u1,ϕj〉L2(0,l)+β2〈u0,ϕj〉L2(0,l)),cj=12γj((β2+γj)〈u0,ϕj〉L2(0,l)+〈u1,ϕj〉L2(0,l)),dj=−12γj((β2−γj)〈u0,ϕj〉L2(0,l)+〈u1,ϕj〉L2(0,l)).Substitutingu(z,t)=M(z)N(t)in the homogeneous form of (10) and rearrangement leads to the equation(38)τqρcN″(t)+(τqwbcb)N′(t)N(t)=kM″(z)−wbcbM(z)M(z).Since the left-hand side depends only on t and the right-hand side depends only on z. It follows that each side is equal to a constant−(wbcb+kpj2)that is derived from takingM(z)∈{ϕj(z)}j=1∞in Table 1 corresponding to the suitable boundary condition, we have the following equation:(39)τqρcNj″(t)+(τqwbcb)Nj′(t)+(wbcb+kpj2)Nj(t)=0.Solution for Eq. (39), for each value of n, is(40)Nj(t)=e−(β/2)t×{ajcos(ωjt)+bjsin(ωjt)if|2−τqβ|<2pjατqcjeγjt+dje−γjtotherwiseBy applying the initial conditions (11),aj,bj,cjand djcan be calculated. Thus the explicit solution of the homogeneous problem (10) and (11) is(41)u(z,t)=e−(β/2)t×{∑j=1∞(ajcos(ωjt)+bjsin(ωjt))ϕj(z)if|2−τqβ|<2pjατq∑j=1∞(cjeγjt+dje−γjt)ϕj(z)otherwiseand explicit expression of C0-semigroup (32) is given as(42)S(t)(u0u1)=(uut).□From (34), the explicit solution for inhomogeneous problem (10) and (11) yields(43a)u(z,t)=e−(β/2)t∑j=1∞1γj(〈T0(z)−v(z,0),ϕj〉L2(0,l)×(β2sinh(γjt)+γjcosh(γjt))−〈∂v(z,0)∂t,ϕj〉L2(0,l)sinh(γjt))ϕj+∑j=1∞1γj∫0te−(β/2)(t−s)sinh(γj(t−s))(〈1τqρc(1+τq∂∂t)Qr,ϕj〉L2(0,l)−〈(∂2∂t2+β∂∂t+A0)v,ϕj〉L2(0,l)+〈Qm+wbcbTb,ϕj〉L2(0,l))dsϕjfor the case|2−τqβ|≥2pjατqwhile(43b)u(z,t)=e−(β/2)t∑j=1∞1ωj(〈T0(z)−v(z,0),ϕj〉L2(0,l)×(β2sin(ωjt)+ωjcos(ωjt))−〈∂v(z,0)∂t,ϕj〉L2(0,l)sin(ωjt))ϕj+∑j=1∞1ωj∫0te−(β/2)(t−s)sin(ωj(t−s))×(〈1τqρc(1+τq∂∂t)Qr,ϕj〉L2(0,l)−〈(∂2∂t2+β∂∂t+A0)v,ϕj〉L2(0,l)+〈Qm+wbcbTb,ϕj〉L2(0,l))dsϕjfor the case|2−τqβ|<2pjατq.In some practical problems, the functionv(z,t)does not have the second derivative with respect to time. Thus the solution (43a) and (43b) does not work. This happens when one faces the pulse heat flux at the skin surface with BC (9a) (see Section 4.3.3). In this case, variational boundary value problem (VBVP) corresponding to the boundary value problem (5) with the BC (9a) is used successfully. Note that solutions based on VBVP demands less smoothness [30].By using the transformationT1(z,t)=T(z,t)−Tc, Eq. (5) can be changed to the following initial boundary value problem:(44)k∂2T1∂z2+wbcb((Tb−Tc)−T1)+Qm+Qr+τq(−wbcb∂T1∂t+∂Qr∂t)=ρc(τq∂2T1∂t2+∂T1∂t)(45)T1(z,0)=T0(z)−Tcand∂T1(z,t)∂t|t=0=0with the boundary conditions(46)−k∂T1(z,t)∂z|z=0=f0(t),T1(l,t)=0Theorem 7A VBVP corresponding to the problem(44)with the BC(46)is in the following form: Find a functionT1(z,t)that belongs to Hilbert spaceL2(0,l)and that satisfies the equation(47)a(T1,ϕ)=〈φ,ϕ〉L2(0,l)wherea(T1,ϕ)=k〈∂T1∂z,dϕdz〉L2(0,l)+〈wbcbT1+(τqwbcb+ρc)∂T1∂t+ρcτq∂2T1∂z2,ϕ〉L2(0,l)〈φ,ϕ〉L2(0,l)=〈wbcb(Tb−Tc)+(Qm+Qr)+τq∂Qr∂t,ϕ〉L2(0,l)+k[∂T1∂zϕ]0lfor all functions ϕ such thatϕ∈H1(0,l)and satisfies in the BC(12a),a:H1×H1→Ris a bilinear form andφ:H1→Ris a linear functional.By multiplying ϕ and integrating by parts from Eq. (44) the theorem is proved.□LetT1(z,t)=∑nT1n(t)ϕn(z)where functions ϕnare selected from Table 1. From Eq.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, two methods of solving thermal wave equation are derived based on strongly continuous semigroups theory to analyse the various thermotherapy or skin burning in the clinical studies. In practice, results from this research can help the physician to raise the temperature of the disease׳s tissue to a therapeutic value, and then thermally destroy it, (see examples in Sections 4.1–4.3). In order to make a reasonable comparison, the data for conducted calculations are taken from the practitioners in the thermal engineering departments. This mathematical simulation benefits to medical therapy by clear analysis of where, when, how much, how and in which style, one may apply the heat sources on the patient׳s living tissue. From the mathematical point of view, when the pulse surface heat flux is applied, the hybrid method based on C0-semigroup and the corresponding variational boundary value problem are used to derive the closed form analytical solution. Different ways (exponential, point and adiabatic sources) of actual thermal loads are modelled through various initial-boundary value problems. Spurious unwanted oscillations near the discontinuity caused by numerical solutions for the parabolic–hyperbolic equations do not coincide with the problems physical properties. The closed form analytical solutions proposed in this paper do not suffer from the unwanted oscillations near and far from the discontinuities. The mathematical simulations show the efficiency of the proposed solutions for different practical cases.None declared.
