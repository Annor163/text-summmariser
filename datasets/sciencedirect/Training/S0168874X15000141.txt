@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the conventional isogeometric analysis, a topologically complex shell structure is required to be modeled using multiple NURBS patches. In the CAD industry, however, the topologically complex shell structure is conveniently and efficiently created via trimming techniques rather than constructing multiple untrimmed NURBS patches. With this feature, the isogeometric analysis which enables to handle the topologically complex shell structure with a single NURBS patch is presented in this paper. In the present method, the information of the topologically complex shell structure composed of the untrimmed surface and trimming curves is directly utilized into isogeometric shell analysis. For numerical integration, a special integration scheme is adopted considering the inside or the outside of the trimmed boundaries which are described by the trimming curves. For the shell formulation, the degenerated shell element based on the Reissner–Mindlin theory is employed. The exact surface normal vectors and their analytic derivatives are adopted into the formulation. The shell formulation is validated with linear elastic benchmark problems. Then linear elastic problems of topologically complex shell structures are dealt with using the proposed procedures, and the effectiveness is illustrated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Isogeometric analysis [1] has shown great success on the various engineering fields such as, structural analysis [2–5], contact problems [6–8], fluid analysis [9–12], fluid–structure interaction problems [13,14], structural vibration analysis [15], optimization [16–20], just to name a few. Also the studies on shell structures have been performed by many researchers with the affirmative features of the isogeometric analysis [21–42].Kirchhoff–Love shell theory is based on the assumption that the shell is thin enough to neglect transverse shear deformations. In the governing equation, rotations of the shell are described by the second derivatives of the displacements. Thus this theory requires at leastC1continuity at the interfaces of the elements. In this regard, the isogeometric analysis is suited for the Kirchhoff–Love shell since the necessary continuity is fulfilled by NURBS expression. J. Kiendl et al. [25,26] developed the isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell and dealt with the shell structures comprised of multiple patches by the bending strip method. Nguyen-Thanh et al. [30] introduced the approach for isogeometric analysis of thin shells using polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes. In these cases, however, it is difficult to impose rotation boundary conditions explicitly and additional schemes are required to connect the multiple patches.In Reissner–Mindlin shell and Naghdi shell, transverse shear deformations are taken into account. In the research works by Rho and Cho [21,22], the assumed strain element and assumed natural strain element based on the Naghdi theory were proposed with B-spline basis functions. The proposed method was a pioneering research work on the analysis of geometrically exact shell structures, and it reduces the severe locking troubles. Uhm and Youn [24] presented the isogeometric linear shell formulation using the Reissner–Mindlin theory. They applied T-spline refinements into the shell analysis. Benson et al. [28] proposed the degenerated solid Reissner–Mindlin shell for isogeometric analysis and dealt with linear elastic and nonlinear elasto-plastic problems. Dornisch et al. [33,40] developed the shell formulation with the exactly calculated direction vectors. They accounted the new approach to calculate exact nodal direction vectors and exact nodal basis systems. Hosseini et al. [34,42] developed the isogeometric solid-like shell element for nonlinear analysis. The shell element represents a complete three-dimensional shell by spline basis functions (NURBS or T-splines) for the mid-surface of the shell and Lagrange shape functions for the thickness direction. With this approach, not only the exact shell geometry is described but also the accurate prediction of three-dimensional stress fields becomes possible. Hah et al. [43] applied hierarchically superimposing local refinements for the Reissner–Mindlin shell, and the results show affirmative convergences. Benson et al. [36] proposed the blended isogeometric shell which combines the Kirchhoff–Love theory with the Reissner–Mindlin theory. In the method, the Reissner–Mindlin formulation is used locally where the constraints need to be enforced.As mentioned above, the various research works on the isogeometric shell have been successfully conducted. However, mostly simple shell structures have been handled. The serious limitation of the researches is that they could not treat topologically complex shell structures, since they are based on the conventional isogeometric approach. Due to the tensor-product nature of NURBS description, only four-sided domains can be treated. Thus the analysis domain of a topologically complex shell needs to be divided into multiple NURBS patches, and additional schemes are required for sewing the patches. However in the CAD industry, topologically complex surfaces are often modeled by employing trimming techniques. If the information of the topologically complex surface is exported in IGES file or STEP file, the information of the untrimmed NURBS surface and the trimming curves is described separately. With this motivation, there are some attempts to handle the topologically complex surface without constructing multiple patches. First of all, the isogeometric method which can analyze two-dimensional trimmed surface was proposed by Kim et al. [2,3,44], and it was named as Trimmed Surface Analysis (TSA). They developed the special schemes for numerical integration and for imposition of boundary conditions considering the trimmed domain boundaries which are described by the trimming curves. With the method, any complex geometry can be analyzed efficiently using only a single NURBS patch. Since this method can save cost and effort for dividing and joining patches, it is very useful and practical for the isogeometric analysis. Cho et al. [23] proposed the shell element based on the Naghdi shell theory with exact geometric representations by NURBS. Also trimmed surface geometries are handled with the information of the surface and the information of the trimming curves. Unlike the above-mentioned research works by Kim et al., however, the trimmed parametric domain is divided and then the structural mesh generation is applied to the divided domains. The numerical integration is simpler than that of the works by Kim et al., but structural mesh generation considering the trimmed surface geometry is additionally required. Schmidt et al. [32] proposed the isogeometric analysis which can handle trimmed NURBS surfaces with the local reconstruction technique. In this method, the trimmed NURBS patches are reconstructed by the interpolation method or the least square approximation with the information of the trimming curves. The method is quite effective to handle trimmed NURBS surfaces and to apply an arbitrarily shaped loading area onto the surface. However, the trimmed boundaries are still not exactly described, and the accuracy of the reconstructed patch boundaries is dependent on the number of sampling points. Another try was conducted by Wang et al. [45]. In the research, the main idea is the same as that of the research works by Kim et al., but the mappings for numerical integration are quite different. Also, compound shell structures are handled by degree-of-freedom coupling of the intersected surfaces.In the present paper, the isogeometric analysis methodology for topologically complex shell structures is presented. The basic concept of the TSA is adopted and appropriately modified so as to handle the topologically complex shell structures. The complex domain of the shell structure can be treated efficiently with a single patch, and the higher continuity can be maintained throughout the domain, while the continuity decreases at the patch boundaries when the domain is constructed by multiple patches. In the case of using multiple patches, the patch partitioning may affect the solution at the geometrically sensitive areas, such as sharp corners. However, the patch partition dependency is naturally omitted in the present method. Besides, the present method is expected as an appropriate analysis method for the shape and topology optimization of shell structures where the complex topologies of the shell structures are frequently handled.For the shell formulation, the degenerated shell element based on the Reissner–Mindlin shell theory is employed. In the conventional FEM using the Reissner–Mindlin shell theory, the normal vector of an arbitrary point is calculated by interpolating of the neighboring nodal normal vectors. And the local basis systems are set with the interpolated normal vectors. Unlike the conventional FEM, the surface normal vector can be computed directly and exactly at any point in isogeometric analysis due to the higher-order smoothness of NURBS. Nevertheless, in most isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin based shell formulation, normal vectors are still calculated by interpolating of the normal vectors of the relevant control points. The local basis systems are also defined with the interpolated normal vectors. For these reasons, in this paper, the exact surface normal vectors and their analytic derivatives are calculated using the characteristic of NURBS. The local basis systems on the shell surface are defined based on the exact normal vectors for the shell formulation.The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the basics of NURBS and trimmed NURBS surface are presented. The details of the isogeometric shell formulation based on Reissner–Mindlin theory with exact normal vectors is described in Section 3. The shell formulation is validated with benchmark problems. In Section 4, TSA is extended to topologically complex shell structures and the details are described. Numerical examples are handled with the present method, and the results are discussed. Section 5 closes the paper with the concluding remarks.Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) is a tool used widely for modeling geometries in computer-aided design (CAD). NURBS is more flexible and effective to describe geometries than B-splines since it is weighted and rational form of B-spline. The NURBS curve and surface are defined as Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively.(1)C(u)=∑i=1nRi,p(u)wiPi∑j=1nRj,p(u)wj=∑i=1nNi(u)PiwherePiis theith control point,wiis the individual weight forPi, andnis the total number of control points.Ri,p(u)is theith one-dimensional B-spline basis function of orderpwith knot valueu.(2)S(s,t)=∑i=1n∑j=1mRi,p(s)Rj,q(t)wijPij∑k=1n∑l=1mRk,p(s)Rl,q(t)wkl=∑i=1n∑j=1mNij(s,t)PijwherePijis the bidirectional net of control points andwijis the relevant weight.nandmare the numbers of control points in each parametric direction s and t, respectively.pandqare the orders of B-spline basis functions.In Eqs. (1) and (2),Ni(u)represents the one-dimensional NURBS basis function for the curve andNij(s,t)represents the two-dimensional NURBS basis function for the surface.Isogeometric analysis invokes the isoparametric concept that the same basis functions, e.g. NURBS basis functions, are employed not only for geometric description, also for approximation of field variables. The procedure of isogeometric analysis is summarized as follows:1)The information of an analysis model such as the coordinates and weights of control points, the order of basis functions and the knot vectors is exported into the form of IGES, STEP, etc.The physical and parametric domains of the analysis model are defined by the exported information. Additional mesh generation of the model is not required for analysis. The elements of the analysis model are directly defined by the knot spans in the parametric domain, and they uniquely match with the elements in the physical domain. Degrees of freedom (DOFs) are employed to the control points.To obtain sufficient DOFs for accurate analysis, refinement of the analysis domain can be simply performed by knot insertions. During the knot insertion process, the geometry exactness is preserved.For numerical integration of the analysis domain, classical Gaussian quadrature rules are used. In the integration process, the integration points in the master domain are mapped to the parametric domain, then to the physical domain.The boundary and load conditions are imposed as in the conventional FEM. At the boundaries of the domain, Knonecker delta properties are satisfied.Trimming techniques are the effective ways for creating arbitrary complex topological geometries in CAD systems. As depicted inFig. 1, the trimmed surface geometry is defined in the physical domain and in the parametric domain separately. In CAD programs, a virgin untrimmed surface can be cut out with trimming curves as the cutters by trimming techniques. The trimming curves can be drawn onto the surface by various methods, e.g. straight projecting the curve onto the surface, pulling the curve in the surface normal direction onto the surface, creating the shortest possible curve between two points on the surface, etc. After the virgin untrimmed surface is cut by trimming techniques, the information of the trimmed surface geometry can be exported to the standard IGES file or STEP file. In the exported IGES file, the physical domain and the parametric domain of the trimmed surface geometry are described. Also, the information of trimming curves for the parametric domain and for the physical domain is provided separately. The trimming curves in the physical domain are mapped to those in the parametric domain, and vice versa. Consequently, we can have the untrimmed surface and the trimming curves in the parametric domain and in the physical domain, separately.To distinguish the removed parts and the remained parts, there is the orientation rule for the trimming curves in CAD programs. The right-side region following the heading direction of the trimming curve is the removed part, and the left-side region is the remained part as shown in Fig. 1(b).Isogeometric analysis has many favorable features for shell analysis. The physical geometry of a shell structure can be expressed exactly and smoothly by NURBS expression, and the NURBS parameters themselves become the curvilinear coordinates on the shell surface. The surface normal vector can be calculated exactly at an arbitrary point on the smoothly expressed surface. Also, higher-order continuities are guaranteed throughout the domain.In the present research, the degenerated shell element based on Reissner–Mindlin shell theory is employed for isogeometric analysis. By using the Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation where the rotational DOFs are explicitly defined, imposing rotation boundary conditions is easer and intuitive. Also it is suitable for the analysis domain which is constructed of multiple patches that haveC0continuity at the interfaces.For the degenerated shell element in isogeometric analysis, the mid-surface of the shell structure is described by NURBS surface. Since the control points of the shell structure do not lie on the surface in general as shown inFig. 2, how to define local basis systems and how to impose rotational DOFs are the issues in isogeometric shell analysis. There are several ways to define the local basis systems on a shell surface, the projection method is applied in the present research. As can be seen in Fig. 2, each control pointPiis projected on the shell surface and the projected pointPi′becomes the origin of the local basis system.Defining surface normal vectors is a very crucial issue for shell analysis, especially at integration points for numerical integration. In the conventional FEM and most of the isogeometric analysis based on Reissner–Mindlin shell theory, the normal vector of any arbitrary point is calculated by interpolating the neighboring nodal normal vectors. Thus the accuracy of normal vectors deteriorates more as rising complexity of surface geometry and as increasing the mesh size.Recently, the isogeometric shell analysis with exactly calculated direction vectors was researched by Dornisch et al. [33]. In this research, the error of the angle and length of the interpolated direction vectors is investigated. They found out that the interpolation of direction vectors does not maintain the length and the orthogonality of the local basis systems, and it has influence on locking. By their proposed interpolation scheme, the orthonormality of the interpolated basis system is achieved at every integration point and the accuracy of solution is improved. However, the normal vectors of the shell surface are still calculated by interpolation. Solving the linear algebra equations for obtaining the exact nodal direction vectors and nodal basis systems requires extra computational cost.In the shell formulation of the present research, the nodal rotations are interpolated but the exact normal vectors are used. A unit normal vector at an arbitrary pointaon the shell surface can be naturally obtained by Eq. (3) if the knot values(sa,ta)of the point are known. Since the normal vector is calculated by the derivatives of surface with respect to the parameterssandt, it hasCp−k−1continuity throughout the domain.

(5) and (6), respectively.(5)x={xyz}=∑Ni(s,t)Pi+ζ∑Ni(s,t)v3iti2wherePi=PxiPyiPziTis the coordinates of theith control point.tiis the thickness of the shell andv3iis the normal vector at the projected point fromPi.ζis the coordinate in thickness direction.(6)u={uvw}=∑Ni(s,t){uiviwi}+ζ∑Ni(s,t)μiti2{αiβi}whereμi=[−v2iv1i]=[−l2il1i−m2im1i−n2in1i]In the present research, however, the exact normal vector and other direction vectors as represented in Eqs. (3) and (4) are employed to describe the position vector and the displacement vector. The direction vectors are functions of the parametersandt, and it is differentiable with respect tosandt. Thus, dissimilar to the expressions Eqs. (5) and (6), the position and displacement vectors with the exact direction vectors can be represented as Eqs. (7) and (8).(7)x={xyz}=∑Ni(s,t)Pi+ζv3(s,t)∑Ni(s,t)ti2(8)u={uvw}=∑Ni(s,t){uiviwi}+ζμ(s,t)∑Ni(s,t)ti2{αiβi}The isogeometric shell formulation requires integration through the shell thickness direction. The master element is introduced for numerical integration. The integration points in the master element are properly mapped to the parametric domain and then to the physical domain as described inFig. 3.The transformation equationRis(9)R:{ξ,η,ζ}→{s,t,ζ}s=ξ2(s2−s1)+12(s2+s1)t=η2(t2−t1)+12(t2+t1)ζ=ζThe transformation equationSis defined as(10)S:{s,t,ζ}→{x,y,z}x=∑Ni(s,t)Pi+ζv3(s,t)∑Ni(s,t)ti2Strains in terms of displacements derivatives are expressed as(11){εxεyεzγxyγyzγzx}T=H{u,xu,yu,z⋯w,z}TwhereH=[100000000000010000000000001010100000000001010001000100]The derivatives of displacements with respect tox,yandzin the right-hand side of Eq.

The description of the problem is shown inFig. 4(a). A pair of vertical concentrated load is applied at the diametrically opposite location of the cylinder surface in inward direction. The both sides of the cylinder are supported by rigid diaphragms (ux=uz=θy=0). Young׳s modulus isE=3.0×106and Poisson׳s ratio isν=0.3. The length, radius and thickness areL=600,R=300andt=3.0, respectively. Due to the symmetric shape, one eighth of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 4(b), is modeled and analyzed.Fig. 5 represents the convergence curves by the present shell formulation whenp=2,3,4, and they are compared with two reference values. For the vertical displacement at the point A, one of the reference values is Flugge׳s analytic solutionuA=1.8248×10−5. The other one is the converged numerical solution by NASTRAN with QUAD8 elementsuA=1.8541×10−5in [21]. By the statement in the literature [21], transverse shear deformation is not considered in Flugge׳s analytic solution. Thus the numerical solution by NASTRAN is converged at the slightly higher value than the analytic solution. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the results by the present method reaches to the slightly higher value than the analytic solution, but very close to the FEM result (NASTRAN).For comparison with the results of Dornisch et al. [33], the results whenp=2,4,5by the present method are normalized to1.83×10−5and plotted with the results by Dornisch et al. inFig. 6. As can be seen from the figure, it is shown that the accuracy and the convergence rate of the present formulation are quite close to those of the research by Dornisch et al. However, the results of the present method are not exactly converged to a certain value and they become slightly higher over the reference as rising the number of elements. The comment on this phenomenon is also stated in [47]. This is because the transverse displacement of Reissner–Mindlin shell under a concentrated load is singular and it goes to infinity [48]. Also, in both methods, slow convergence rate is observed whenp=2due to the locking phenomena. The locking is remarkably reduced withp>2without any treatment.Scordelis–Lo roof under the self-weight is analyzed with the shell formulation with exact direction vectors.Fig. 7(a) shows the geometry of the Scordelis–Lo roof. The both curved ends of the roof are supported by rigid diaphragms and the rest edges are left freely. The roof is subject to a uniform vertical gravity (g=90per unit area). The radiusR, lengthL, thicknesstand angleθare 25, 50, 0.25 and 80, respectively. The material properties areE=4.32×108andν=0.0. Due to the symmetry, one quarter model is used for analysis as shown in Fig. 7(b). The reference converged numerical solution of the vertical displacement at the point A isuA=0.3024[46].Fig. 8 represents the convergence curves of the solution by the present shell formulation, and they are compared with the reference value. The results by the present method converge to 0.3020395, slightly lower than the reference valueuA=0.3024.To compare the results whenp=2,4,6by the present method with the results of Dornisch et al. [33], the results are plotted together inFig. 9. It can be seen that both the methods show almost identical convergences, but the solutions converge to the different values which are slightly lower than the reference value. The converged value of the results by Dornisch et al. isuA=0.3020247.
