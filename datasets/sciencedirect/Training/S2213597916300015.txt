@&#ABSTRACT@&#
High resolution ultrasound and photoacoustic images of stained neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes from a blood smear were acquired using a combined acoustic/photoacoustic microscope. Photoacoustic images were created using a pulsed 532nm laser that was coupled to a single mode fiber to produce output wavelengths from 532nm to 620nm via stimulated Raman scattering. The excitation wavelength was selected using optical filters and focused onto the sample using a 20× objective. A 1000MHz transducer was co-aligned with the laser spot and used for ultrasound and photoacoustic images, enabling micrometer resolution with both modalities. The different cell types could be easily identified due to variations in contrast within the acoustic and photoacoustic images. This technique provides a new way of probing leukocyte structure with potential applications towards detecting cellular abnormalities and diseased cells at the single cell level.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) was first developed in the early 1970’s at Stanford University. When using frequencies at 1000MHz, the ultrasound imaging resolution approaches 1μm; various biomedical applications including the imaging of single cells became readily apparent [1,2]. In SAM, the image contrast depends on the biomechanical properties of the cell assessed through the scattering and attenuation of the acoustic waves [3]. This enables high resolution images of single cells and cellular organelles with contrast not possible using optical microscopy [4–12].Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) uses similar hardware as acoustic microscopy, but with the addition of a pulsed laser to create the photoacoustic waves. In PAM, chromophores within the cell absorb the incident laser energy and emit an acoustic wave [13]. The acoustic wave, called a photoacoustic wave, is then detected by the same ultrasound transducer that is used in SAM. PAM is well suited to creating images of single cells using their natural endogenous chromophores, which include hemoglobin in erythrocytes [14–17], melanin in melanoma cells [14,18], DNA in cell nuclei [19] and cytochrome C in the mitochondria [17,20]. Photoacoustic images of single cells can also be created using exogenous chromophores such as dyes or nanoparticles [16,21].Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) provides sub-micrometer lateral resolution, which is achieved by focusing the laser to a diffraction limited spot (approximately 200nm using a 532nm laser) [14,22]. The emitted photoacoustic waves are then detected using an ultrasound transducer with central frequencies up to about 100MHz [17,23–25]. The diffraction limited laser spot provides excellent lateral resolution as photoacoustic waves are generated from within the focal spot only, however axial resolution suffers as it depends on the acoustic bandwidth of the transducer. Transducers used in these studies typically have lateral and axial resolutions in the 20–50μm range [26], and thus are unsuitable for acoustical imaging of single cells.We have pioneered the use of PAM using frequencies at 1000MHz [27–29]. Combined with traditional pulse-echo acoustic microscopy, our system is capable of either acoustic or photoacoustic imaging with micrometer resolution. Images with excellent lateral and axial resolution are obtained; a quantitative analysis of the signals can also be performed to extract biomechanical or structural information about the cell [18,30–35]. To date, combined acoustic and photoacoustic imaging of the same structures at 1000MHz has not been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the combined imaging approach on single cells in a blood smear.A blood smear is a monolayer of blood cells fixed and stained on top of a glass substrate [36]. The smear is composed of erythrocytes and leukocytes that are spatially separated, and as a result are ideal for both acoustic and photoacoustic microscopy. Blood smears are routinely examined by hematologists using optical microcopy to identify and diagnose blood disorders [37]. However leukocytes are transparent in the visible spectrum, and difficult to identify without the use of a colorimetric stain. Metachromatic Romanowksy type dyes such as the Wright stain differentially stain cellular organelles and are often used for visual identification [38]. However, even when stained it can be difficult to identify abnormalities present in the blood cells.Using a photoacoustic microscope outfitted with a fiber-coupled pulsed laser and a 1000MHz transducer, this study demonstrates combined ultrasound and photoacoustic images of stained leukocytes at optical wavelengths of 532 and 600nm. This technique has the potential to identify blood-related abnormalities and reveal structural detail that can be difficult to assess using optical microscopy alone.
