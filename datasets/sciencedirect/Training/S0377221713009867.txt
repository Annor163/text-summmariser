@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We address the single-machine stochastic scheduling problem with an objective of minimizing total expected earliness and tardiness costs, assuming that processing times follow normal distributions and due dates are decisions. We develop a branch and bound algorithm to find optimal solutions to this problem and report the results of computational experiments. We also test some heuristic procedures and find that surprisingly good performance can be achieved by a list schedule followed by an adjacent pairwise interchange procedure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The single-machine sequencing model is the basic paradigm of scheduling theory. In its deterministic version, the model has received a great deal of attention from researchers, leading to problem formulations, solution methods, scheduling insights, and building blocks for more complicated models. Extending that model into the realm of stochastic scheduling is an attempt to make the theory more useful and practical. However, progress in analyzing stochastic models has been much slower to develop, and even today some of the basic problems remain virtually unsolved. One such case is the stochastic version of the earliness/tardiness (E/T) problem for a single machine.This paper presents a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm for solving the stochastic E/T problem with normally-distributed processing times and due dates as decisions. This is the first appearance of a solution algorithm more efficient than complete enumeration for this problem, so we provide some experimental evidence on the algorithm’s computational capability. Although B&B algorithms are not new, they have seldom been applied to problems in stochastic scheduling. Arguably, too little research has been done on the application of such optimization approaches in stochastic scheduling problems, so a broader goal of this paper is to demonstrate that methodologies common in deterministic scheduling can successfully be applied to problems in stochastic scheduling.In addition, we explore heuristic methods for solving the problem, and we show that a relatively simple procedure can be remarkably successful at producing optimal or near-optimal solutions. These results reinforce and clarify observations made in earlier research and ultimately provide us with a practical method of solving the stochastic E/T problem with virtually any number of jobs.In Section 2 we formulate the problem under consideration, and in Section 3 we review the relevant literature. In Section 4, we describe the elements of the optimization approach, and we report computational experience in Section 5. Section 6 deals with heuristic procedures and the corresponding computational tests, and the final section provides a summary and conclusions.In this paper we study the stochastic version of the single-machine E/T problem with due dates as decisions. To start, we work with the basic single-machine sequencing model (Baker & Trietsch, 2009a). In the deterministic version of this model, n jobs are available for processing at time 0, and their parameters are known in advance. The key parameters in the model include the processing time for job j (pj) and the due date (dj). In the actual schedule, job j completes at time Cj, giving rise to either earliness or tardiness. The job’s earliness is defined by Ej=max{0, dj−Cj} and its tardiness by Tj=max{0, Cj−dj}. Because the economic implications of earliness and tardiness are not necessarily symmetric, the unit costs of earliness (denoted by αj) and tardiness (denoted by βj) may be different. We express the objective function, or total cost, as follows:(1)G(d1,d2,…,dn)=∑j=1n(αjEj+βjTj)The deterministic version of this problem has been studied for over 30years, and several variations have been examined in the research literature. Some of these variations have been solved efficiently, but most are NP-Hard problems. In the stochastic E/T problem, we assume that the processing times are random variables, so the objective becomes the minimization of the expected value of the function in (1). The stochastic version of the E/T problem has not been solved.To proceed with the analysis, we assume that the processing time pjfollows a normal distribution with mean μjand standard deviation σjand that the pjvalues are independent random variables. We use the normal because it is familiar and plausible for many scheduling applications. Few results in stochastic scheduling apply for arbitrary choices of processing time distributions, so researchers have gravitated toward familiar cases that resonate with the distributions deemed to be most practical. Several papers have addressed stochastic scheduling problems and have used the normal distribution as an appropriate model for processing times. Examples include Anderson and Moodie (1969), Balut (1973), Cai and Zhou (2007), Jang (2002), Portougal and Trietsch (2006), Sarin, Erdel, and Steiner (1991), Seo, Klein, and Jang (2005), Soroush (1999), Soroush and Fredendall (1994), and Wu, Brown, and Beck (2009).In our model, the due dates djare decisions and are not subject to randomness. The objective function for the stochastic problem may be written as(2)H(d1,d2,…,dn)=E[G(d1,d2,…,dn)]=∑j=1n(αjE[Ej]+βjE[Tj])The problem consists of finding a set of due dates and a sequence of the jobs that produce the minimum value of the function in (2).
