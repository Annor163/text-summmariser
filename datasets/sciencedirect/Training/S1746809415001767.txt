@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been commonly used for assessing the level of anesthesia during surgery. However, the collected EEG signals are usually corrupted with artifacts which can seriously reduce the accuracy of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors. In this paper, the main purpose is to compare five different EEG based anesthesia indices, namely median frequency (MF), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and permutation entropy (PeEn), for their artifacts rejection ability in order to measure the DOA accurately. The current analysis is based on synthesized EEG corrupted with four different types of artificial artifacts and real data collected from patients undergoing general anesthesia during surgery. The experimental results demonstrate that all indices could discriminate awake from anesthesia state (p<0.05), however PeEn is superior to other indices. Furthermore, a combined index is obtained by applying these five indices as inputs to train, validate and test a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) model with bispectral index (BIS) as target. The combined index via ANN offers more advantages with higher correlation of 0.80±0.01 for real time DOA monitoring in comparison with single indices.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Anesthesia is a necessary tool for individual patient undergoing surgery in operating room to ensure loss of consciousness but has risks. Inadequate drug dosage may have severe consequences for patients such as possible intraoperative awareness with memory due to under dosage and recovery time delay which cause a potential increase of other postoperative complications associated with over dosage [1–3]. Evaluation of anesthetic depth provides knowledge of balance between state of patients and anesthetic drug administration [3]. Therefore, accurate monitoring of DOA can contribute to improvements in safety and quality of anesthesia thus better patients’ satisfactions.Electroencephalogram (EEG), a measure of electric activity of human brain through non-invasive technique has long been widely used in clinical environment for offering evidence to determine the status of the patients directly and objectively. Especially, indices based on EEG analysis are increasingly applied to measuring the depth of anesthesia (DOA) during surgery [4]. In recent years, various commercial monitors have been designed to assess the DOA. The bispectral index (BIS) introduced by Aspect Medical Systems Inc. generates a single dimension vector ranging from 0 to 100 to represent the level of consciousness [5]. BIS algorithm takes into account several subparameters in time, frequency domain and high order spectral information and produces a statistically complex index. However, BIS is questionable in several anesthesia agents such as ketamine and nitrous oxide and possibly cannot distinguish awake from anesthesia state [5]. Especially, the detailed algorithm of BIS calculation have not been disclosed by the manufacturing company. In addition, entropy module developed by Datex–Ohmeda produces two parameters related to different frequency bands to assess anaesthetic depth, which are response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) [6]. Nevertheless, this monitor is based the spectral entropy analysis of power spectrum evaluated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and can omit some important nonlinear information in EEG [7]. Such monitors just consider linear parameters in time and frequency domain, which require linear and stationary signals, are not optimal to analyze EEG with nonlinear and nonstationary behavior. Furthermore, both BIS and spectral entropy are sensitive to artifacts in practical application [8]. Therefore, an open source monitor combining linear and nonlinear parameters even chaotic patterns in the brain is needed to better trace the changes in the level of consciousness.There are numerous features extracted from EEG signals using different methods. Early attempts mostly have used linear methods in frequency domain based on FFT. The EEG frequency spectrum analysis provides valuable information during intraoperative monitoring in the individual subject. Furthermore indices based on the frequency spectrum such as 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF) [9,10], median frequency (MF) [11,12] are derived and have variously been used to estimate the DOA. Nevertheless, it has been noted that nervous systems of human being present various nonlinear characteristics to certain extent [13]. Thus, many researchers suggest that the EEG signals should be considered as a chaotic pattern instead of a series of sine waves [14–16]. Consequently, methods from nonlinear dynamics are necessary in analysis of EEG signals [17,18]. In particular, entropy is a widely developed concept related to chaotic system that measures the complexity in a time series in the past thirty years [19,20]. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was introduced by Pincus in 1991 [21], which could easily be applied to anesthetic depth monitoring during surgery [22]. ApEn provides a potential solution to rapid calculation of the regularity for medical data analysis. Sample entropy (SampEn) developed by Richman and Moorman [23] is an improved algorithm to estimate the complexity of signals, such as heart rate variability and EEG [24,25]. Furthermore, in 2002 Bandt and Pompe proposed a new method named Permutation entropy (PeEn) [26] for measurement of complexity. PeEn combines the concepts of entropy and symbolic dynamics.The parameters mentioned above have been suggested as measures of the DOA using EEG data for clinical application. However EEG based monitors have some limitations; they are easily contaminated by artifacts such as electrooculography (EOG) due to blinks and 60Hz power line interference from external electrical signals. The artifacts in EEG signal increase the difficulty in monitoring DOA in clinical surgeries. It is indicated that the corresponding technologies used to measure DOA of patients reliably do require the accurate detection of EEG pattern in the presence of artifacts. Such issues are important design consideration for application in DOA monitors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify the relative artifacts effects on MF, SEF, ApEn, SampEn and PeEn algorithms for monitoring DOA individually and combined. The work is performed using a database that contains ten pairs of synthesized EEG and twenty-six real EEG signals collected from patients in operation room during surgery. Four types of artifacts were modeled and then added into uncorrupted EEG to form the synthesized signals. The performance of each algorithm to monitor the DOA is measured on both synthesized and real signals. In this paper, coefficient of variation (CV) of each index for synthesized EEG with different level of artifacts, and correlation coefficient are measured. The measures are compared to BIS [27–29] which recorded in real time and used as gold standard. Finally, a combined index is obtained by applying the five indices as inputs to train, validate and test a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) model [30] with BIS as the target. Different measures are used to examine the different dimension of EEG waveform. The linear quantification of DOA based on spectrum analysis reflects the frequency information. In contrast the nonlinear methods which are based on entropy extract regularity information. For this reason, a combination of these variables may monitor the DOA more reliably and accurately than a single index.The rest of the paper is divided into three sections. Section 2 describes the procedure of the five different algorithms for monitoring DOA based on EEG signals. In Section 3, data preparation, the performance criteria, experimental results and discussion of the proposed algorithm are provided, and in Section 4, the paper is concluded.Several variables can be derived from EEG signal with the analysis of power spectrum, such as spectral edge frequency. The 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF) and median frequency (MF) stand for the frequencies below which 95 and 50% of the total power of the EEG signal are located. SEF 95 and MF derived from EEG can be reduced with increasing anesthetic concentration of general anesthesia. Therefore, the frequency shift in the EEG signal from high in the awake state to low in the anesthesia state will be indicated by a numerical decrease in both MF and SEF 95. In this paper, the power spectral estimation of EEG signals is based on fast Fourier transform [31].Approximate entropy (ApEn) was proposed as a valuable tool to evaluate the regularity degree of data series and thus widely used to measure the complexity of EEG for quantifying the consciousness level of patients [22,23,32]. For a given number of previous values used for the prediction of the subsequent value m, a filtering level r and a time series {x(n)}=x(1), x(2),…, x(N) with N data points, the ApEn can be calculated according to the following algorithm [22]:(1)ApEn=Φm(r)−Φm+1(r)where Φm(r) is defined as(2)Φm(r)=1N−m+1×∑i=1N−m+1lnCim(r)(3)Cim(r)=Bi(N−m+1)and Biis the number of Xm(j) satisfying d[Xm(i), Xm(j)]≤r, Xm(i) and Xm(j) are vectors defined by(4)Xm(i)=xi,xi+1,xi+2,…,xi+m−1(5)Xm(j)=xj,xj+1,xj+2,…,xj+m−1According to previous research [22,23], parameters m=2, r=0.2 were observed for ApEn calculation with best performance. Therefore, in this paper the parameters are set as follows m=2, r=0.2.SampEn is an improved algorithm from ApEn exclude self-matches used commonly to measure the complexity of a physiological time series. Similarly, for a given time series {x(n)}=x(1), x(2),…, x(N) with N data points, embedding dimension m and tolerance r, SampEn can be calculated as follows:(6)SampEn(m,r,N)=−lnBm+1(r)Bm(r)where Bm(r) is defined as(7)Bm(r)=1N−m∑i=1N−mBim(r)(8)Bim(r)=1N−m−1Biand Biis the number of vectors Xm(j) meeting d[Xm(i), Xm(j)]≤r, i≠j, Xm(i) and Xm(j) are defined as (4) and (5) mentioned above.Generally, the value of m is set to be 2 and the value of r to be 0.2 according to previous studies [25,33,34]. In this paper the parameters are set as follows: m=2 and r=0.2.Permutation entropy (PeEn) provides a simple and robust method to estimate complexity of time series, taking the temporal order of the values into account. Given a time series {x(n)}=x(1), x(2),…, x(N) with N data points, embedding dimension m, and the lag τ. Considering the value sequencexi,xi+1,xi+2,…,xi+m−1, the permutation patternπ=r0,r1,r2,…,rm−1of (0, 1, 2, …, m−1) is defined to fulfill(9)xi+r0≤xi+r1≤xi+r2≤⋯≤xi+rm−1For each π the relative frequency is determined using in the following equation(10)p(π)=BN−m+1where B is the number ofxi,xi+1,xi+2,…,xi+m−1which has the same type π for 0≤i≤N−m.Then, we further extend (xi, xi+1, xi+2, …, xi+m−1) by considering an embedding delay τ asxi,xi+1×τ,xi+2×τ,…,xi+(m−1)×ττ≥1, the PeEn is defined by(11)PeEn(m,τ,N)=−∑i=1m!p(π)lnp(π)A previous study [26] suggests 3<m<7 with τ=1 to measure the complexity of time series using PeEn, and the authors in [35] set m=6, τ=1 to measure EEG signals. Thus in this paper the parameters are set as follows: m=6 and τ=1.
