A hybrid finite element formulation is developed by using the Hellinger–Reissner functional which is obtained from the complementary energy functional for pre-buckling and buckling analysis of thin-walled beams by introducing element equilibrium and force boundary conditions as auxilary conditions. Comparison to the complementary energy based formulation the current hybrid formulation is advantageous because it does not require the satisfaction of inter-element force equilibrium a-priori and therefore it is easily adaptable within the existing displacement-based thin-walled beam finite-element analysis codes for which the assemblage procedure is relatively easy. Comparison to the displacement-based formulations the current hybrid formulation has the advantage of incorporating the shear deformation effects easily by using the strain energy of the shear stress field without modifying the basic kinematic assumptions of the thin-walled beam theory. In the current formulation, the effects of load position can also be easily captured by virtue of the freedom provided in the beam axis selection. Comparisons with solutions from literature and those based on shell element models are presented and an example is designated to illustrate the significance of shear deformation effect.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thin-walled structural components are widely used in many industries including aerospace, building, aircraft and ship-building. Due to their slenderness these types of structures are susceptible to buckling and it is important to predict their response accurately. Closed-form solution procedures for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members date back to the late nineteenth century [1–4]. However, these formulations are limited to certain boundary and loading conditions. On the other hand, numerical techniques can be used to obtain solutions that are applicable to general cases. Development of numerical techniques for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members started in early seventies, Krajcinovic [5] and Barsoum and Gallagher [6] developed displacement-based finite element formulations for flexural and lateral–torsional buckling analysis of thin-walled members.The effect of shear deformation can gain importance in the buckling behaviour of beams especially with built-up or composite sections [7,8] or alternatively when materials with relatively low shear modulus is used such as FRP [9,10]. By modifying the kinematic assumptions of the theory of Vlasov [11], Kim et al. [12], Saade et al. [13] and recently Erkmen and Attard [14] included the effects of shear deformation for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members. Erkmen and Mohareb [15,16] included the shear deformation effects by using a complementary energy-based formulation and a correspondingly developed finite element formulation. The advantage of this formulation is that shear deformation effects can be included without modifying the basic kinematic assumptions. However, for the element of Erkmen Mohareb [16], the inter-element force equilibrium conditions have to be a-priori satisfied which complicates the assemblage procedure. On the other hand, multi-field finite elements can be used to overcome the shortcomings of both displacement based and complementary energy based formulations. A number of hybrid and mixed element models have been proposed since the early papers of Pian [17,18]. A comprehensive literature review on mixed/hybrid elements until early 1990s can be found in [19]. In particular, for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis of beams, hybrid/mixed finite element formulations have been proposed by Kumar et al. [20], Alsafadie et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22].In this study, a hybrid finite element formulation is developed by using the Hellinger–Reissner functional for buckling analysis. By introducing the equilibrium and force boundary conditions as auxilary conditions, the Hellinger–Reissner functional is obtained from the complementary energy functional. Complementary energy expression for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis has been a subject of controversy since the works of Levinson [23] and Zubov [24], who attempted to derive a strict stress-based complementary energy formulation in terms of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor by applying Legendre transformation to the total potential energy. Several researchers including de Veubeke [25], Koiter [26], Dill [27] and Ogden [28] pointed out that the uniqueness of the Legendre transformation cannot be guaranteed in Levinson's and Zubov's derivations. Koiter [29] adopted the Jaumann stress tensor for finite elasticity solutions and obtained the complementary energy expression for semilinear isotropic material, which can be considered as a generalization of Hooke's law in geometrically non-linear elasticity, relating the right extensional strain to the Jaumann stresses. Koiter's formulation alleviates the uniqueness issues, however, the functional is not a strict stress-based formulation and contains the rotation expressions in addition to the stress quantities. Koiter [30] also formulated a general stability criterion in terms of the Jaumann stress tensor and the rotation tensor under the assumptions of small strains, moderately small rotations, and a linearized pre-buckling state. In this work, Koiter's complementary energy formulation is adopted to derive the Hellinger–Reissner functional. Further discussions on the derivation of the complementary energy formulation for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis can be found in the works of Oran [31–32], and Santos et al. [33–35].On the other hand, the benefit of the hybrid formulation is that, the resulting matrix equations consist of only the nodal values of displacements as unknowns, despite the fact that the element is formulated by a multivariable Hellinger–Reissner functional. Thus, the assemblage procedure is as simple as in the case of displacement-based elements. Also, the shear deformation effects are taken into account by using the strain energy of the shear stress field by virtue of the developed Hellinger–Reissner functional where stress resultants and displacements are independent parameters. Thus, no modification on the basic kinematic assumptions of the thin-walled beam theory is needed in order to include the shear deformation effects. The formulation captures the effects of load position by virtue of the freedom provided in the beam axis selection. Comparisons with solutions from literature and those based on shell element models are presented and an example is designated to illustrate the significance of shear deformation effect.The paper is organised as follows; deformations and adopted stress definitions for an infinitesimal body is given in Section 2. Kinematic relations, and stress resultant definitions for the thin-walled beam theory are given in Section 3. Problem scope is introduced in Section 4. The equilibrium equations and the variational formulation are introduced in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Section 7 develops the finite element formulation based on the adopted interpolation fields. Comparisons with existing solutions from literature and those based on shell-type analyses are presented in Section 8. Conclusions are drawn in Section 9.Two coordinate systems are adopted. The fixed XYZ (spatial) Cartesian coordinate system (Fig. 1) has the Z axis oriented along the axial direction (in the un-deformed configuration) of the beam while axes X–Y are parallel to the plane of the cross-section. The xyz (material) curvilinear coordinate system (Fig. 1) is altering with the deformation of the structure so that x, y and z coordinates of a point on the beam after deformation will be identical of those before deformation. The material coordinate system coincides with the spatial coordinate system only for the undeformed beam.The deformation gradient tensor Fij, is the partial differentiation of the current position vector Xiwith respect to the material coordinate xji.e., Fij=∂Xi/∂xj. Throughout the text X1, X2 and X3 indicate X, Y, Z, and x1, x2 and x3 indicate x, y, z, respectively. Based on the polar decomposition theory, deformation gradient tensor Fijcan be expressed in terms of the rigid body rotation tensor Rik, and the symmetric right extensional strain tensor εkjas Fij=Rik(εkj+δkj), in which δkjis the Kronecker's delta and throughout the text repeated index summation convention is adopted for indices i, j and k. The infinitesimal parallelepiped in Fig. 1 is deformed under the successive application of stretch, rotation and rigid translation described by the displacement fields us, vsand wsalong the X, Y and Z directions, respectively. In Fig. 1, the unit vectors of the triade→0are defined along the principal strain directions of the un-deformed parallelepiped while the unit vectors of the triade→are defined along the principal strain directions of the deformed parallelepiped. Note that the directions of coordinate axis XYZ and xyz are not necessarily oriented along the principal directions.Rotation tensor Rijdetermines the orientation of triade→with respect to the triade→0(Fig. 1) i.e., ei=Rije0j. Six of the nine components of the rotation tensor are linearly dependent given the orthogonality property RijRmj=δim. By using the Euler–Rodrigues formula [30], the rotation tensor can be expressed in terms of three independent rotation vector components ϕ1, ϕ2 and ϕ3 about the X, Y and Z direction, respectively, as(1)Rij=δij(1−12ϕkϕk)+εikjϕk+12ϕiϕj+o(|ϕ|3)In Eq. (1), εimjis the permutation symbol and o(|ϕ|3) represents rotation vector terms higher than the second order. Throughout the text the indices 1, 2, 3 for ϕiindicate X, Y, Z, respectively.The deformation of the beam axis passing through point Bpand the projections of the deformed axis to Y–Z plane and X–Z plane are illustrated inFig. 2a–c, respectively. Based on the right hand rule sign convention, the direction of the rotation vector with component ϕXis opposite to the direction which provides a positive displacement derivativevs'(Fig. 2b) (primes denote differentiation with respect to longitudinal coordinate z) whereas the direction of the rotation vector with component ϕYis identical to the direction which provides positive displacement derivativeus'(Fig. 2c). Thus, one hasϕX=−vs'andϕY=us'. Also, by neglecting the rotation terms higher than second order, the rotation tensor can be expressed in matrix form as [36,37](2)Rij≈[1−ϕZus'ϕZ1vs'−us'−vs'1]+12[−(ϕZ2+us'2)−vs'us'−ϕZvs'−vs'us'−(ϕZ2+vs'2)ϕZu's−ϕZvs'ϕZus'−(vs'2+us'2)]InFig. 3, an initially un-deformed parallelepiped has the dimensions dx, dy and dz which stays constant in the material coordinates throughout deformation. On the other hand, the dimensions of the deformed parallelepiped are measured in terms of dX, dY and dZ in spatial coordinates. The forces fX, fYand fZare acting on the surfaces which were initially perpendicular to X, Y and Z axes, respectively. In general, forces fX, fYand fZdo not act along the directions of the normal to the surfaces nX, nYand nZ. The components i0X, i0Yand i0Zof triadi→0(Fig. 3) are unit vectors along X, Y and Z directions, respectively.The first Piola–Kirchoff stresses Dijare defined as the forces acting along X, Y and Z axes per unit of initial un-deformed area i.e., Djk=[fj/(dxpdxq)]i0k, in which j≠p≠q (i.e., p and q are not free indices and are determined by index j in order to refer to the un-deformed areas on which the forces fjare acting [38]). Indices 1, 2, 3 for Dij, fjand i0kindicate X, Y, Z, respectively. Note that the triadi→0in Fig. 3 is fixed with the spatial coordinate system while the triade→0in Fig. 1 is oriented along the principal directions and varies from point to point within the volume of the element. For isotropic materials, the Jaumann stresses σikcan be expressed in terms of the first Piola–Kirchoff stress tensor Dijand the rigid body rotation tensor Rjkas σik=DijRjk[30]. Note that indices 1, 2, 3 for σikindicate x, y, z, respectively. Since the direction of Jaumann stress components change throughout deformation, the Jaumann stresses are referred to the material coordinate system.The cross-section remains rigid under deformation, in agreement with the first Vlasov assumption. As a result of the first Vlasov assumption, the in-plane buckling displacements us(s,z) and vs(s,z) of a point Bp(Fig. 4) located on the section mid-surface can be expressed in terms of the in-plane displacement components u(z) and v(z) of an arbitrarily located pole Ap(ax,ay) located in the plane of the cross-section and the angle of twist of the cross-section ϕZ(z) (Fig. 4a). Coordinate s, measured from an arbitrary sectorial origin S0located on the section profile, and oriented according to the right hand rule about axis z, identifies material coordinates [x(s),y(s)] of point Bpwith respect to the material coordinate system. Thus, one has(3)us(s,z)=u(z)−[y(s)−ay]sinϕZ(z)≈u(z)−[y(s)−ay]ϕZ(z)(4)vs(s,z)=v(z)+[x(s)−ax]sinϕZ(z)≈v(z)+[x(s)−ax]ϕZ(z)In Eqs. (3) and (4) all ϕZ(z) terms up to second order in Taylor series expansion (i.e., sinϕZ(z)=ϕZ(z)+o(|ϕZ|3)) are retained. From Eqs. (3) and (4), by taking the derivatives with respect to the longitudinal coordinate z, one obtains the cross-section rotation fields consistent with a Vlasov beam as(5)ϕX(z,x)=−v'(z)−(x−ax)ϕz'and(6)ϕY(z,y)=u'(z)−(y−ay)ϕz'Stress distributions and stress resultant-stress relations are postulated to be in agreement with those based on the Vlasov theory. In line with the Vlasov theory, the stress components σxx, σyy, σxy, DXX, DYX, DXY, DYY, are neglected throughout the analysis i.e., and the stress resultant functions are defined as(7)(a)N(z)=∫Aσzz(z,s)dA,(b)Mx(z)=∫Aσzz(z,s)y(s)dA,(c)Vy(z)=∫Aσzy(z,s,r)dA,(d)My(z)=−∫Aσzz(z,s)x(s)dA,(e)B(z)=∫Aσzz(z,s)ω(s)dA,(f)Vx(z)=∫Aσzx(z,s,r)dA,(g)T(z)=∫A{−σzx(z,s,r)[y(s)−rcosα−ay]+σzy(z,s,r)[x(s)+rsinα−ax]}dA(h)Tw(z)=∫A{−σzx(z,s,r)[y(s)−ay]+σzy(z,s,r)[x(s)−ax]}dAIn Eq. (7)ω(s)=∫S0sh(ξ)dξandh(s)=(x−ax)sinα(s)−(y−ay)cosα(s)(Fig. 4b), coordinate r is the normal distance from the mid-surface, dA=drds is an element of cross-section area in the material coordinates,∫AdA=∫S(∫−t(s)/2t(s)/2dr)ds, symbols ∫A and ∫S are due to the integration over the total area and perimeter of the cross-section respectively and t(s) is the plate thickness (Fig. 5). The stress expressions in terms of stress resultants functions in a non-orthogonal coordinate system are adopted from [39].(8)σzz=〈1−x(s)−y(s)−ω(s)〉D−1{NMy−Mx−B}in which matrix D is given by(9)D=[A−Sy−Sx−Sω−SyJyyJxyJωx−SxJxyJxxJωy−SωJωxJωyJωω]and the section constantsA=∫AdA,Sy=∫AxdA,Sx=∫AydA,Sω=∫AωdA,Jxx=∫Ay2dA,Jxy=∫AxydA,Jyy=∫Ax2dA,Jωx=∫AωxdA,Jωy=∫AωydA,Jωω=∫Aω2dAare defined.In line with the Vlasov theory, the Jaumann stress components σzxand σzyare expressed in terms of a stress component σzsacting in the direction tangent to the section contour line for small deformations (Fig. 5a) i.e., σzy=σzssinα and σzx=σzscosα The magnitude of this component can be expressed as the resultant of the components σzyand σzxthroughσzs2=σzx2+σzy2. Also, it is noted that the stress component σzrwhich is in the direction normal to the tangent to the profile vanishes (Fig. 5a) i.e.,(10)σzr=σzxsinα−σzycosα=0The stress component σzsconsists of two components: a component constant across the thickness (due to the combination of warping torsion and biaxial shear forces) and a component with a linear variation along thickness due to the St. Venant torsion. Thus, the Jaumann stress component σzsis assumed to have a linear distribution across the thickness taking the formσzs(z,s,r)=σc(z,s)+σsv(z,r)in whichσc(z,s)is the constant component across the thickness andσsv(z,r)has linear variation throughout thickness. For small deformation the distribution of the Jaumann stress component σzsacross thickness is illustrated in Fig. 5b. The constant stress component can be expressed in terms of the stress resultant functions as [39](11)σc(z,s)=1t(s)〈A¯(s)−S¯x(s)−S¯ω(s)〉D−1{0VxVyTw}In Eq. (11), the functionsA¯(s)=∫sbsdA,S¯y(s)=∫sbsxdA,S¯x(s)=∫sbsydAandS¯ω(s0,s)=∫sbsω(s0,s)dAare defined, in which sbis the coordinate s of the one of the edges of the cross-section at which Jaumann stress componentσc(z,s)vanishes i.e.,σc(z,sb)=0. The stress component due to St. Venant torsion (which is linear across the thickness) is(12)σsv(z,r)=2rJdTsv(z)A thin-walled beam is brought from the un-deformed state to a deformed state under a reference pre-buckling load. Under the reference load, the structure will undergo a rotation tensorRijpand will be subjected to the Piola–Kirchoff stress fieldsDijpor the Jauman Stress tensorσijp. As a general notation convention, all field variables with a superscript p will relate to the pre-buckled configuration under the reference load (Fig. 6).The reference load is then increased by a scalar multiplier value λ so that the structure attains the state of onset of buckling. At that state, the corresponding rotation tensor, first Piola–Kirchoff stress, and Jauman stress tensors becomeλRijp,λDijp,λσijp, respectively.In the final buckled configuration, the final rotation tensor, first Piola–Kirchoff stress, and Jauman stress tensors becomeRij⁎,Dij⁎,σij⁎. As a general notation convention, variables with a superscript ⁎ will relate to the final buckled configuration.In going from the point of onset of buckling to the final buckled configuration, the change in rotation tensor, first Piola–Kirchoff stress, and Jauman stress tensors are noted as ΔRij, ΔDij, Δσij, respectively. The above three sets of rotation and stress fields are related throughRij⁎=λRijp+ΔRij,Dij⁎=λDijp+ΔDij,andσik⁎=λσikp+Δσik.Finally, all field variables without a superscript ⁎ or p and those which are not preceded by Δ are generic in nature and can be applied to the pre-buckling state, to the onset of buckling, or to the final buckled configuration by changing symbols, as needed. This has been the case for all field variables appearing in Eqs. (1) through (12). For instance, by adding a ⁎ superscript to all field variables in Eq. (1), one recovers an expression for the rotation tensor in the final buckled configuration i.e.,Rij⁎=δij(1−(1/2)ϕk⁎ϕk⁎)+εikjϕk⁎+(1/2)ϕi⁎ϕj⁎.By neglecting the pre-buckling rotations (i.e.,λRijp=δijandϕi⁎=λϕip+Δϕi≈Δϕi), the rotation tensor in the final buckled configurationRij⁎can be expressed in terms of the buckling rotation vector components in going from the state of onset of buckling to the final buckled configuration Δϕias(13)Rij⁎=δij(1−12ΔϕkΔϕk)+εikjΔϕk+12ΔϕiΔϕjFlexural buckling phenomena occur when a member is subjected to axial forces and lateral torsional buckling phenomena occur when a member is subjected to loads which induce bending about the section major principal axis and the associated shear forces. The limiting condition corresponding to the buckling state under such loads is obtained through a bifurcation analysis. The presence of lateral forces inducing bending about the minor axis and the associated shear, torsion, or bimoments, would transform the problem into a non-linear force-deflection analysis. In the buckling analysis sought in the current study, such effects do not appear. Thus, the beam is subjected to axial forces, bending moments acting about the major axis and in-plane vertical forces, which do not cause any pre-buckling shear forcesVxpand associated bending momentsMyp, twisting moments due to warpingTwp, St. Venant torsionTsvp, nor bimoments Bpthroughout the beam. In all subsequent formulations, the beam axes x and y are selected to be parallel to the major and minor axis, respectively (Fig. 7a–d).Throughout buckling, the displacements in vertical direction, moments about the major axis, associated shear force acting along the minor axis, and increment in axial force all vanish i.e., Δv=ΔMx=ΔVy=ΔN=0. The later condition is consistent with the inextensional buckling assumption [40]. Deformations prior buckling are neglected. The formulation provides modeling flexibility by selecting non-orthogonal as well as orthogonal systems of coordinates. By selecting the origin O, pole Ap, sectorial origin Soto coincide with the point of application of the external load P, one can pursue a buckling analysis in which the effect of the transverse load position is considered (e.g., Fig. 7 a illustrates a case where top flange loading is applied to a mono-symmetric section).By using the relations in Eq. (7) for pre-buckled and buckled configurations, and using the relationσik⁎=λbσik+Δσikone obtains(14a)Np(z)=∫Aσzzp(z,s)dA,(14b)Mxp(z)=∫Aσzzp(z,s)y(s)dA,(14c)Vyp(z)=∫AσzypdAand(15a)ΔMy(z)=−∫AΔσzz(z,s)x(s)dA,(15b)ΔB(z)=∫AΔσzz(z,s)ω(s)dA,(15c)ΔVx(z)=∫AΔσzxdA,(15d)ΔT(z)=∫A{−Δσzx[y(s)−ay−rcosα]+Δσzy[x(s)−ax+rsinα]}dA(15e)ΔTw(z)=∫A{−Δσzx[y(s)−ay]+Δσzy[x(s)−ax]}dABy using Eqs. (8), (11) and (12) for pre-buckled and buckled final configuration, and the relationsσik⁎=λσik+Δσik,ΔMx=ΔVy=ΔN=0,andVxp=Myp=Twp=Tsvp=Bp=0, one obtains(16)σzzp=〈1−x(s)−y(s)−ω(s)〉D−1{Np0−Mxp0}(17)Δσzz=〈1−x(s)−y(s)−ω(s)〉D−1{0ΔMy0−ΔB}(18)Δσc(z,s)=−1t(s)〈A¯(s)S¯y(s)S¯x(s)S¯ω(s)〉D−1{0ΔVx0ΔTw}and(19)Δσsv(z,r)=2rΔTsv(z)JdTranslational equilibrium can be easily expressed in terms of first Piola–Kirchoff stress tensor Dijsince its components have constant directions along the Z, X and Y axes throughout the volume. In the absence of body forces, the pre-buckling translational equilibrium equations under reference loads are expressed as(20)∂Dijp/∂xi=0Also, the translational equilibrium equations in the final buckled configuration are expressed as(21)λ∂Dijp/∂xi+ΔDij/∂xi=0From Eq. (20), by substituting into Eq. (21), one obtains(22)ΔDij/∂xi=0Since the pre-buckling rotations are negligible i.e.,ϕip=0andλRijp≈δij, the Jaumann stress tensor is found to coincide with the first Piola–Kirchoff stress tensor through the relation(23)σikp=DijpRjkp≈Dijpδjk=DikpThe equilibrium of angular momentum can be reduced to the symmetry condition of the Jaumann stress tensor i.e.,εrikσik⁎=εrikDij⁎Rjk⁎=0, from which one obtains(24)(λDijp+ΔDij)=(λσikp+Δσik)Rjk⁎From Eq. (23), by substituting into Eq. (24), and neglecting the second order small terms in the resulting expressions [30], the angular equilibrium equations simplify to(25)ΔDik=Δσik+λσijpεjmkΔϕmBy expanding Eq. (22) while eliminating the vanishing stresses, the translational equilibrium equations along the Z, X and Y directions are expressed respectively as(26)∂(ΔDZZ)∂z+∂(ΔDXZ)∂x+∂(ΔDYZ)∂y=0(27)∂(ΔDZX)∂z=0(28)∂(ΔDZY)∂z=0Also, by eliminating the vanishing stresses for the Vlasov beam, the nine angular equilibrium equations obtained from Eq. (25), simplify to(29a)λσxzpΔϕX=0,(29b)λσxzpΔϕY=0,(29c)λσyzpΔϕX=0,(29d)λσyzpΔϕY=0and(30a)ΔDZZ=Δσzz,(30b)ΔDZX=Δσzx−λ(σzzpΔϕY−σzypΔϕZ),(30c)ΔDZY=Δσzy−λσzxpΔϕZ+λσzzpΔϕX,(30d)ΔDXZ=Δσxz,(30e)ΔDYZ=ΔσyzFrom Eqs. (30a), (30d) and (30e), by substituting into Eq. (26), and using the relations[∂(Δσsz)/∂s]ds=[∂(Δσsz)/∂x]dx+[∂(Δσsz)/∂y]dy,dx=dscosα,dy=dssinα,andΔσxz=ΔσszcosαandΔσyz=Δσszsinαone obtains the equilibrium condition along the Z direction in terms of Jaumann stresses due to buckling as(31)∂(Δσzz)∂z+∂(Δσsz)∂s=0Similarly by expanding Eq. (20), the translational equilibrium equation along the Z direction in the pre-buckled configuration can expressed as(32)∂(σzzp)∂z+∂(σszp)∂s=0By multiplying Eq. (32) by y(s), integrating over the cross-section area, and using the relation dA=t(s)ds one obtains(33)∫A[∂(σzzp)∂z+∂(σszp)∂s]ydA=∫A∂σzzp∂zydA+σszpy(s)t(s)|S−∫Aσszp∂y∂sdA=0In Eq. (33) symbol |Sdenotes the integration over the perimeter of the cross-section. Thus, the second term on the right hand side vanishes since the stresses vanish at the boundaries of the cross-section i.e.,σszp|S=0. By substituting the relations ∂y/∂s=sinα andσyz=σszsinαinto Eq. (33), one obtains(34)∫A∂σzzp∂zydA−∫AσzypdA=0Also, by using Eqs. ((14b), (14c)) in Eq. (34), one obtains(35)Mx'−Vy=0By substituting Eq. (30b) into Eq. (27) and integrating over the cross-section area one obtains(36)∫A∂∂z[Δσzx−λ(σzzpΔϕY−σzypΔϕZ)]dA=0Eq. (6) is applied for the buckling deformation i.e.,ΔϕY(z,y)=Δu'(z)−(y−ay)Δϕz'and then substituted into Eq. (36). By using the expression for the pre-buckling stress resultants (Eqs. (14a)–(14c)) and Eqs. ((15a)–(15c) for the buckling stresses and integrating with respect to coordinate z, one obtains(37)ΔVx=ΔVxα+λ(NpΔu'−MxpΔϕZ'−VypΔϕZ+ayNpΔϕZ')=0in which constant ΔVxαappears when integrating Eq. (36) with respect to coordinate z.By multiplying Eq. (27) byay−y(s)+rcosαand Eq. (28) byx(s)−ax+rsinα, summing both equations, integrating over the cross-section area and using the moment equilibrium Eqs. (30b) and (30c), one obtains(38)∫A{∂∂z[Δσzx−λ(σzzpΔϕY−σzypΔϕZ)]}(ay−y+rcosα)+{∂∂z[Δσzy−λσzxpΔϕZ+λσzzpΔϕX]}(x−ax+rsinα)dA=0By substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (38), and using the stress resultant expressions (14a) and (14b) for pre-buckling stresses and Eq. (15d), one obtains(39)ΔT'−λ{NpayΔu'−MxpΔu'−2MxpayΔϕZ'+Np(ay2+ax2)ΔϕZ'+WΔϕZ'}+∫Aσzzp{[Δu'−(y−ay)ΔϕZ']cosα+[(x−ax)ΔϕZ'+Δv']sinα}rdA+ΔϕZ∫A[σzyp(y−rcosα−ay)+σzxp(x−ax+rsinα)]dA}'=0By noting that for any function f(s,z),∫Af(s,z)rdA=∫Sf(s,z)(∫−t(s)/2t(s)/2rdr)dsand∫−t(s)/2t(s)/2rdr=0, the first integral term appearing in Eq. (39) can be shown to vanish. By using Eq. (10) and from the relationsx−ax=hsinα,y−ay=−hcosα,σzxp=σzspcosαandσzyp=σzspsinα, the last integral term appearing in Eq. (39) can also be shown to vanish. In Eq. (39), W is the Wagner stress resultantW=∫Aσzzp(x2+y2)dA[40]. By using Eq. (16) for the pre-buckling state, one obtains.(40)W=〈Ip−Ipy−Ipx−Ipω〉D−1{Np0−Mxp0}In Eq. (40), the sectional propertiesIp=∫A(x2+y2)dA,Ipy=∫Ax(x2+y2)dA,Ipx=∫Ay(x2+y2)dAandIpω=∫Aω(x2+y2)dAwere used. By defining constants(41)rN02=〈Ip−Ipy−Ipx−Ipω〉D−1{1000}and(42)βNx=〈Ip−Ipy−Ipx−Ipω〉D−1{00−10}−2ay.one can express the Wagner stress resultant for mono-symmetric sections in terms of the pre-buckling stress resultants asW=NprN02+Mxp(βNx+2ay). By integrating Eq. (39) with respect to z one obtains(43)ΔT=ΔTα+λ[NpayΔu'−MxpΔu'+βNxMxpΔϕZ'+Np(rN02+ay2+ax2)ΔϕZ']in which symbol ΔTαappears when integrating Eq. (39) with respect to coordinate zBy multiplying Eq. (31) by x(s), integrating over the cross-section area, and using the relationdA=t(s)dsone obtains(44)∫A[∂(Δσzz)∂z+∂(Δσsz)∂s]xdA=∫A∂Δσzz∂zxdA+Δσszx(s)t(s)|S−∫AΔσsz∂x∂sdA=0In Eq. (44) symbol |Sdenotes the integration over the perimeter of the cross-section. Thus, the second term on the right hand side vanishes since the stresses due to buckling vanish at the boundaries of the cross-section i.e.,Δσsz|S=0. By substituting the relations∂x/∂s=cosαandΔσxz=Δσszcosαinto Eq. (44), one obtains(45)∫A∂Δσzz∂zxdA−∫AΔσzxdA=0Also, by using Eqs. (15a)–(15c) in Eq. (45), one obtains(46)−ΔM'y−ΔVx=0By multiplying Eq. (31) by ω(s), integrating over the cross-section area and using the relationdA=t(s)dsone obtains(47)∫A[∂(Δσzz)∂z+∂(Δσsz)∂s]ω(s)dA=∫A∂Δσzz∂zωdA+Δσszω(s)t(s)|S−∫AΔσsz∂ω∂sdA=0The second term on the right hand side of Eq. (47) vanishes since the stresses due to buckling vanish at the boundaries of the cross-section i.e.,Δσsz|S=0. By using the relations∂ω/∂s=h(s),Δσxz=ΔσszcosαandΔσyz=Δσszsinαin Eq. (44), one obtains(48)∫A∂Δσzz∂zωdA−∫A[−Δσzx(y(s)−ay)+Δσzy(x(s)−ax)]dA=0From Eqs. (15b) and (15e) by substituting into Eq. (48) one obtainsΔB'−ΔTw=0. By using the relationΔT=ΔTw+ΔTsv, one obtains(49)ΔB'−ΔT+ΔTsv=0The material is assumed to be of elastic semilinear type, which is defined by replacing the engineering stress-strain pair in linear elasticity with the Jaumann stress and right extensional strain pair in Hooke's constitutive relations. The complementary energy expression for semilinear material under finite deformations is provided by Koiter [30] as(50)πc(Rij⁎,σij⁎)=∫V0[14G(σij⁎σij⁎−ν1+νσii⁎2)+σii⁎−Rij⁎σji⁎]dVIn Eq. (50), G is the shear modulus, ν is the Poisson's ratio and V0 is the volume of the un-deformed body. Linearized buckling analysis (in which pre-buckling deformations are neglected) can be performed in two steps. First; linear static analysis is performed under applied loads. Second; by using the internal forces obtained from the linear static analysis and substituting into the stability condition, an eigenvalue problem is obtained. Similar to the Trefftz stability criterion for total potential energy i.e.,δ((1/2)δ2π)=0, one can express the stability criterion based on the complementary energy as provided by Koiter [30] and Oran [31] i.e.,δ((1/2)δ2π⁎)=0.For the pre-buckling analysis, i.e.Rij⁎=δijandσij⁎=σijpthe complementary energy can be written as(51)πc(σij)=∫V0[14G(σijpσijp−ν1+νσiip2)]dVBy omitting the vanishing stress fields in pre-buckling analysis i.e.,σxxp=σyyp=σxyp=σzxp=0, the energy simplifies to(52)πc=∫V[12E(σzzp)2+14G(σxzp2+σzxp2)]dVIn Eq. (52), the relationE=2G(1+ν)was used. From Eq. (16) by substituting into Eq. (52), the complementary energy can be expressed in terms of the stress resultants as(53)πc=∫L{12E〈NMx〉Dp−1{NMx}+12GVy2χp−1}dzIn Eq.

Multiplying Eq. (56) with a minus sign and performing integration by parts produces(57)πHR=∫L{Mxv″+qyv+Nw'+qzw−12E〈NMx〉Dp−1{NMx}−12GVy2χp−1}dzwhere qz=N' andqy=−Vz'were used.By expanding the complementary energy functional in the neighborhood of the buckling configuration using Taylor series, neglecting the terms higher than the second order and considering the fact that the first variation vanishes δπc=0, one obtains the second variation of complementary energy expression as [30](58)δ2πc=∫V0{(λσiipΔϕmΔϕm−λσijpΔϕjΔϕi)+12G[ΔσijΔσij−ν(1+ν)(Δσii)2]}dVBy omitting the vanishing stress fields in buckling analysis i.e.,Δσxx=Δσyy=Δσxy=σxxp=σyyp=σxyp=0, the second variation of complementary energy simplifies to(59)δ2πc=∫V[λ[ΔϕY2σzzp+ΔϕX2σzzp−ΔϕZΔϕY(σyzp+σzyp)−ΔϕZΔϕX(σxzp+σzxp)]+1E(Δσzz)2+12G(Δσxz2+Δσzx2+12G(Δσyz2+Δσzy2)]dVIn Eq. (59), the relationE=2G(1+ν)was used. By substituting Eqs. (5) and (6) into Eq. (59), integrating the termΔϕY2σzzp+ΔϕX2σzzp−ΔϕZΔϕY(σyzp+σzyp)−ΔϕZΔϕX(σxzp+σzxp)over the cross-sectional area and using Eqs. (29a) and (29d), i.e.,λσxzpΔϕX=λσyzpΔϕY=0, one obtains(60)δ2πc=λ∫L{∫A[(Δu'−(y−ay)Δϕ'Z)2σzzp+((x−ax)Δϕ'Z)2σzzp]dA}dz+∫V[1E(Δσzz)2+1G(Δσxz)2+1G(Δσyz)2]dVIn Eq. (60), by performing the integration over the cross-sectional area and using the relationW=∫Aσzzp(y2+x2)dA=NprN02+Mxp(βNx+2ay)one obtains(61)δ2πc=λ∫L[Δu'2N+2Δu'ΔϕZ'(−Mxp+ayNp)+ΔϕZ'2(rNo2+ay2+ax2)Np+Δϕ'Z2βNxMxp]dz+∫V[1E(Δσzz)2+1G(Δσxz)2+1G(Δσyz)2]dVBy using the relationsΔσzx=Δσzscosα,Δσzy=Δσzssinα,andΔσzs=Δσc+Δσsv, the last two terms in Eq. (61) can be expressed as∫V0[(Δσzx)2+(Δσzy)2]dV=∫V01/G(Δσzs)2dV=∫V01/G(Δσc+Δσsv)2dV. Since the integration across the thickness of the linear stresses due to St. Venant torsion vanish i.e.,∫−t(s)/2t(s)/2Δσsvdr=0, one obtains(62)∫V01G[(Δσzx)2+(Δσzy)2]dV=∫V01G[(Δσc)2+(Δσsv)2]dVFrom Eqs.

The finite element formulation is obtained by interpolating the displacement field v and w using polynomial functions of the axial coordinate z. The element is developed by using cubic interpolation for the vertical displacement and linear interpolation for the axial displacement, i.e.(72)vip(z)=N(z)Tvip,(73)wip(z)=L(z)TwipwhereNT=〈(1−3z2/L2+2z3/L3)(z−2z2/L+z3/L2)(3z2/L2−2z3/L3)(−z2/L+z3/L2)〉,vipT=〈vip(0)vi'p(0)vip(L)vi'p(L)〉andwipT=〈wip(0)wip(L)〉are defined.It should be noted that for distributed member load cases, the linear bending moment and constant axial force assumptions are only approximate. In the case of distributed loads accurate solution may require mesh refinement.By substituting Eqs. (69)–(73) into Eq. (57), the discretized form of the Hellinger–Reissner functional for buckling analysis can be written as(74)This functional depends on the vector of unknownsNip,Mxip, wiand viFrom the partial stationary condition with respect to NiandMxip, i.e.∂πHR/∂Ni=0and∂πHR/∂Mxip=0, one obtains(75)where matrices Hpand Gpin Eq. (75) can be written as(76)and(77)It should be noted that the stationary condition with respect to the stress resultant parameters can be written at the element level because due to the relaxation of inter-element equilibrium the nodal stress resultant parameters do not couple between the elements. By means of Eq. (75), the functional in Eq. (74) becomes(78)From the stationary condition with respect tovipandwip, i.e.∂πHR/∂vip=0and∂πHR/∂wip=0, the discretized equilibrium equations of the system can be obtained as(79)in whichKpi=∫LGpTHpGpdzis the element stiffness matrix for pre-buckling analysis and F is the energy equivalent nodal load vector. Direct nodal loads can be applied using the Dirac delta function as multipliers of the member loads in the second integral in Eq. (78).The buckling stress resultant fields for an element i of span L can be written as(80)ΔMy(z)=L(z)TΔMyi(81)ΔB(z)=L(z)TΔBi(82)ΔTsvi(z)=ΔTsviin which,ΔMyiT=〈ΔMyi(0)ΔMyi(L)〉andΔBiT=〈ΔBi(0)ΔBi(L)〉. The finite element formulation is obtained by interpolating the lateral displacement and angle of twist fields using cubic polynomials, i.e.(83)Δui(z)=N(z)TΔuiand(84)Δϕi(z)=N(z)TΔφiwhere,ΔuiT=〈Δui(0)Δui'(0)Δui(L)Δui'(L)〉andΔφiT=〈Δϕi(0)Δϕi'(0)Δϕi(L)Δϕi'(L)〉are defined.By substituting Eqs.

The problems presented also provide an indication of the validity of the new solution in comparison to results based on shell finite element analysis solutions and other closed form or numerical solutions in literature. Two elements are developed in this study. In element BEH (Buckling Element based on Hybrid formulation), the effect of shear deformation is omitted (i.e., χ−1≈0), whereas in element BEHS (Buckling Element based on Hybrid formulation including Shear deformation) the effect of shear deformation is retained. For all examples except Examples 8.1, 8.2, 8.5 and 8.7, only sixteen beam elements (BEH or BEHS, as applicable) are used to model the structures.Alternative beam element solution methods developed in the literature are used for comparison purposes. What we call Trahair element herein is a displacement based element and it does not include the effect of shear deformation. For buckling analysis, it has two nodes with four degrees of freedom at each node including lateral displacement, out of plane rotation, angle of twist and warping degrees of freedom. The element is implemented for finite element analysis in [41]. Unless stated otherwise, sixteen Trahair's elements are used for all examples. In all models, pinned supports imply that both the translation and angle of twist are restrained (Δu=Δϕ=0) while the first derivative of lateral displacement and warping deformation are free (Δu'≠0, Δϕ'≠0). Fixed supports imply that the derivative of lateral displacement and warping deformation are prevented as well as lateral displacement and angle of twist (Δu=Δu'=Δϕ=Δϕ'=0). In addition, shell element models developed in ABAQUS commercial software using S4R shell elements are used for comparison purposes.A simply supported column is made of a symmetric I section and is subject to uniform axial load. The column span L is 2000mm and the cross-sectional dimensions are shown inFig. 9. Steel material is used for which the Modulus of Elasticity isE=2×105MPa, Poisson's Ratio isυ=0.3and the corresponding Shear Modulus isG=77×103MPa. An axial load P is applied at the right end of the column at the centroid C of the cross-section. The column is modelled using the current hybrid element and the number of elements used to model the column varied from 2 to 16 elements of equal length. InTables 1 and 2, for the first (flexural) buckling mode and the second (torsional) buckling mode, respectively, the buckling load predictions based on the current hybrid formulation and Trahair's element [40] are compared with those based on ABAQUS FEA shell element model [16] and closed form solutions (which do not include shear deformation effects).One can verify from Table 1 that Elements BEH and BEHS provide upper bound predictions for the flexural buckling modes. On the other hand, as shown in Table 2, elements BEH and BEHS provide a lower bound representation of the stiffness for torsional buckling. It is observed that the inclusion of shear deformation effect provides a more flexible representation of the column stiffness and thus slightly reduces the magnitude of the buckling load. The buckling load predictions are very close to the prediction of the ABAQUS model.Flexural buckling of a cantilever column is calculated by Santos [35] for a span of 1m and the cross-sectional rigidity for bending was taken asEI=1kNm/m2. The analyses in [35] were made by using three different elements; LCDF is a displacement based element using linear interpolation for the axial displacement field and cubic interpolation for the transverse displacement field. LCDF element is called Trahair's element herein; LPBM is a force based element using linear interpolation for the bending moment field and constant field for the axial force; QPBM is also a force based element using quadratic interpolation for the bending moment field and constant field for the axial force. Results of Santos [35] do not consider the effects of shear deformation and therefore inTable 3, they are compared with those of BEH and the Euler's buckling formula, i.e.Pcr=(2n−1)2π2EI/4L2. It can be seen that BEH is as accurate as QPBM.For the problems shown inTable 4, the cross-section is identical to that given in Fig. 9. All beams are simply supported and span 8000mm. Material is steel. The beam is subject to several linear bending moment distributions. The results based on ABAQUS FEA model is provided in Column 2. The closed form solution for the buckling moment of simply supported beam under uniform bending moment isMu=(π/L)EJyyGJd+(πE/L)2JyyJww. For the case of uniform moment (Case 1 in Table 4), this formula predicts a buckling moment of 286kNm. For other moment gradient configurations, various codes (e.g., LRFD 1999) provide predictions of the critical moment in the formMcr=CbMuin which Cbis a constant depending on the moment gradient. The critical momentsMcr=CbMubased on the LRFD procedure are given in Column (3) of Table 4. Also, the buckling moments based on Trahair elements (sixteen elements) is provided in Column (4), while Columns (5) and (6) provide the buckling moments predicted by elements BEH and BEHS.From Table 4, one can verify that all results are in very good agreement with the results based on ABAQUS, whose predictions are the most conservative among all while Trahair element tends to slightly overestimate the buckling moment by 5% compared to ABAQUS results. Element BEHS provides the closest predictions to ABAQUS solution. As expected, for the 8000mm span members, shear deformation effects are insignificant.A simply supported beam with mono-symmetric cross-section is subjected to uniform bending moment as shown inFig. 10a. Dimensions of the cross-section are shown in Fig. 10b. Material is steel. The beam is analysed for 8000mm (Case 1), and 4000mm (Case 2), spans using four type of solutions: (1) ABAQUS shell element analysis, (2) Trahair's element, (3) BEH element, and (4) BEHS element.Trahair's [40] for the buckling moment of mono-symmetric sections under uniform bending moment isM=Myz[(βxPy/2Myz)±1+(βxPy/2Myz)2], in whichPy=π2EIy/L2andMyz=(π2EIy/L2)(GJd+π2ECw/L2). Trahair's solution is based on orthogonal system of coordinates in which the shear center is offset by 58mm from the centroid in the negative y direction as shown in Fig. 10b, thus the offset value ayis set to −58mm. The mono-symmetric property of the cross-section isβx=(1/Ix)∫Ay(x2+y2)dA−2ay=153.01mm. The results based on Trahair's analysis is provided in Column 3 inTable 5.In BEH and BEHS models, identical results are obtained based on both orthogonal coordinates and non-orthogonal coordinates in which the location of pole, centroid, and sectorial origin can be selected anywhere on the web. The results based on ABAQUS FEA model is provided in Column 2 in Table 5. The results based on BEH and BEHS elements are provided in Columns 4 and 5 in Table 5, respectively. One can verify that the results based on BEH and BEHS are in very good agreement with those based on Trahair [40] and ABAQUS. The maximum difference between ABAQUS analysis and those based on Trahair [40] and BEH are around 9%. The example illustrates the ability of elements BEH and BEHS to successfully capture mono-symmetry effects.The portal frame studied in [42,43] is reinvestigated here. The frames have a column height Lc=4.0m and span Lb=6.0 and is fixed at the two bases and laterally unsupported out of the plane of the frame. Material is steel. Two external loads P acting on the horizontal member are applied at Lb/3 from the columns. Material is steel. The cross section is W200×59. In modelling with BEH and BEHS elements the columns are divided into four, the beam is divided into six elements and the joint is assumed rigid for warping. Predicted buckling loads based on different modelling approaches are given inTable 6. It can be verified that the current hybrid formulation is in very good agreement with the ABAQUS results for which the number of degrees of freedom is 62,400.The cantilever beam with mono-symmetric section shown inFig. 11 is made of aluminium alloy 6063-T6 and has an elasticity modulus of E=66GPa and shear modulus of G=25GPa. The beam is under vertical load at the tip applied at top flange. In [14], the buckling load was determined as 137N. The buckling load predicted by the BEH and BEHS solutions is given inTable 7. It can be verified that the load position effect on the buckling of a mono-symmetric section can be accurately captured with sufficient number of elements.The last example is a propped cantilever with a mono-symmetric cross-section under top flange loading as shown inTable 8 which was initially analysed by Erkmen and Mohareb [16] and used herein to illustrate the effects of shear deformation. The material properties are initially E=200GPa for the elasticity modulus and G=77GPa for the shear modulus and thus E/G ratio is 2.6 based on which the buckling load was determined by the eight element BEH solution as 9343kN. The buckling analysis based on eight element BEHS predicts 8499kN. Thus, the difference between the BEH and BEHS solutions is around 10% due to the effect of shear deformation. We acknowledge that especially when the beam is short, local buckling may interact with overall buckling and influence the behaviour of the beam. However, considerations related to local buckling is beyond the scope of the current formulation. In order capture these effects shell element models or generalized beam theory e.g., [44] can be used. In [16], by using an ABAQUS shell element model, the first mode of buckling was verified to be an overall lateral–torsional buckling mode and thus, despite a short span the beam local buckling modes did not dominate the design.On the other hand, when the E/G ratio is increased to 26 by reducing the shear modulus ten times, which is a typical value for FRP pultruded [44–46] beams, the buckling load predictions based on the BEHS reduce from 8499kN to 4551kN (a reduction of some 47%). It should be noted that when the shear deformation effects are excluded, BEH predicts the buckling load as 8135kN which is 44% higher than 4551kN and thus a significant overestimation occurs for a beam consisting of a material with low shear modulus.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The finite element solutions developed in this study are able to accurately predict classical solutions for column flexural buckling and torsional buckling, and beam lateral torsional buckling under uniform moments and linear moment gradients for doubly symmetric and mono-symmetric sections. The current formulation captures shear deformation effects, a feature that is neglected in most available buckling solutions for thin-walled members. It was shown that conventional solutions which neglect shear deformation effects can overestimate the predicted buckling load in some cases, especially when the E/G ratio is relatively high which may be the case in practice for FRP pultruded beams. Non-colinear elements can be easily connected using the developed finite element formulation as only inter-element displacement continuity is required for the assemblage procedure.
