@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper studies sectorization increase in horizontal and vertical plane. We have simulated downlink (DL) macro long-term evolution (LTE) network using three-dimensional antenna and propagation models. New network layouts have been proposed based on 4-sector site deployment. The challenge was to offer lower network cost and complexity. Simulation results have showed good tradeoff between capacity and mobility performance in comparison to known sectorization schemes. Besides, carrier aggregation (CA) and active antenna system (AAS) have been used to exploit the sector vertical plane. Low frequency band (800MHz) improves coverage and indoor signal penetration in urban environment. Our proposed sectorization schemes give multi-objective network quality of service (QOS).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The number of mobile broadband subscribers worldwide increases perpetually and grew about 7% year-on-year during quarter1 2014. The number of subscriptions increased faster with 35% year-on-year, attaining 2.3 billion. Devices were mostly smartphones leading to mobile data traffic growth of 65% between quarter1 2013 and quarter1 2014 [1]. According to CISCO, mobile data traffic will grow at compound annual growth rate of 61% from 2013 to 2018, reaching 15.9exabytes per month by 2018 [2]. Aiming to satisfy the forecast traffic demand and enhance the user experience, a new generation of mobile cellular network third generation partnership project (3GPP)â€™s LTE has been deployed. Research projects are in progress in order to reach fourth generation (4G) requirements and to fulfill the huge traffic demand especially in dense urban and indoor environments. Actually, work is deeply addressed to optimize LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) as defined from release 10 onwards. In LTE-A, focus is on higher capacity. The driving force to further develop LTE toward LTE-A was to provide higher bitrates in a cost efficient way. The main new functionalities introduced in LTE-A are support of relay nodes, enhanced use of advanced antenna techniques and CA [3]. Traditionally, network capacity expansion is done by deploying new conventional 3-sector sites and small cells. As a result, operator must assume more system complexity, high backhaul resources and difficult networking of numerous low-power base stations (BS). AAS is an advanced antenna technique providing electronic beam control in the vertical plane. Every beam has its own antenna tilt. Indeed, it is possible to split cell into inner and outer cells, called vertical sectorization (VS). The total available radio resources are doubled and the total transmit power is split between inner and outer cells. The use of AAS enhances system coverage and capacity at lower network deployment cost. Previous research results on high order sectorization (HOS) use conventional 3-sector, 6-sector and 12-sector network layouts for additional horizontal sectorization (HS). The vertical plane of conventional 3-sector network layout is used for VS. In this paper, new sectorization schemes based on 4-sector site are proposed and simulated for DL frequency division duplexing (FDD) macro LTE-A network using three-dimensional antenna and propagation models. Some CA scenarios use low frequency band 800MHz. To our knowledge, such 4-sector cellular design using VS and CA is not currently available in literature. Our challenge was to find good tradeoff between network capacity and mobility performance. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of previous research works on increased HS and VS for cellular networks. System model and simulation assumptions are deeply discussed in Section 3. Simulation results of studied network layouts are given in Section 4. Finally, the work is concluded in Section 5.
