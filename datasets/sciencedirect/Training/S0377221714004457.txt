@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present a new method called UTAGMS–INT for ranking a finite set of alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria. It belongs to the family of Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) methods which build a set of preference models compatible with preference information elicited by the Decision Maker (DM). The preference model used by UTAGMS–INT is a general additive value function augmented by two types of components corresponding to “bonus” or “penalty” values for positively or negatively interacting pairs of criteria, respectively. When calculating value of a particular alternative, a bonus is added to the additive component of the value function if a given pair of criteria is in a positive synergy for performances of this alternative on the two criteria. Similarly, a penalty is subtracted from the additive component of the value function if a given pair of criteria is in a negative synergy for performances of the considered alternative on the two criteria. The preference information elicited by the DM is composed of pairwise comparisons of some reference alternatives, as well as of comparisons of some pairs of reference alternatives with respect to intensity of preference, either comprehensively or on a particular criterion. In UTAGMS–INT, ROR starts with identification of pairs of interacting criteria for given preference information by solving a mixed-integer linear program. Once the interacting pairs are validated by the DM, ROR continues calculations with the whole set of compatible value functions handling the interacting criteria, to get necessary and possible preference relations in the considered set of alternatives. A single representative value function can be calculated to attribute specific scores to alternatives. It also gives values to bonuses and penalties. UTAGMS–INT handles quite general interactions among criteria and provides an interesting alternative to the Choquet integral.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Ranking, choice or sorting decision with respect to a finite set of alternatives evaluated on a finite set of criteria is a problem of uttermost importance in many real-world areas of decision-making (Ehrgott, Figueira, & Greco, 2010; Figueira, Greco, & Ehrgott, 2005). Among many approaches that have been designed to support the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), three of them seem to prevail. The first one exploits the idea of assigning a score to each alternative, as it is the case of MAUT - Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). The second relies on the principle of pairwise comparison of alternatives, as it is the case of outranking methods (Roy, 1996). The third one induces logical “if…, then…” decision rules from decision examples, as it is the case of DRSA – Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński, 2001; Słowiński, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2009). The value function, the outranking relation and the set of decision rules are three preference models underlying these three main approaches. It is known that in order to build such models, the Decision Maker (DM) has to provide some preference information.The preference information may be either direct or indirect, depending whether it specifies directly values of some parameters used in the preference model (e.g., trade-off weights, aspiration levels, discrimination thresholds, etc.) or whether it specifies some examples of holistic judgments from which compatible values of the preference model parameters are induced. Eliciting direct preference information from the DM can be counterproductive in real-world decision-making because of a high cognitive effort required. Consequently, asking directly the DM to provide values for the parameters seems to make the DM uncomfortable. Eliciting indirect preference is less demanding of the cognitive effort. Indirect preference information is mainly used in the ordinal regression paradigm. According to this paradigm, a holistic preference information on a subset of some reference or training alternatives is known first and then a preference model compatible with the information is built and applied to the whole set of alternatives in order to arrive at a ranking, choice, or sorting recommendation.Usually, from among many sets of parameters of a preference model representing the preference information given by the DM, only one specific set is selected and used to work out a recommendation. For example, while there exist many value functions representing the holistic preference information given by the DM, only one value function is typically used to recommend the best ranking, choice, or sorting of alternatives. Since the selection of one from among many sets of parameters compatible with the preference information given by the DM is rather arbitrary, robust ordinal regression proposes taking into account all the sets of parameters compatible with the preference information, in order to give a recommendation in terms of necessary and possible consequences of applying all the compatible instances of the preference model on the considered set of alternatives.The recently proposed MCDA methods implementing robust ordinal regression on the three above-mentioned preference models have been described in Greco, Słowiński, Figueira, and Mousseau (2010). The first method in the series, called UTAGMS(Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008), generalizes the UTA method (Jacquet-Lagrèze & Siskos, 1982) which applies ordinal regression to assess a set of additive value functions compatible with preference information provided by the DM. UTA aims at giving a complete ranking using one compatible value function, which is the one minimizing the sum of deviation errors or minimizing the number of ranking errors in the sense of Kendall or Spearman distance. In Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos (1982), the authors of UTA also recommend post-optimality analysis consisting in exploration of the vertices of the polyhedron of compatible value functions, in particular, the vertices for which one or more criteria get a maximum or minimum weight. UTAGMSis considering instead the whole set of compatible additive value functions to compute necessary and possible preference relations.Even if the additive model is among the most popular ones, some critics have been addressed to this model because it has to obey an often unrealistic hypothesis about preferential independence among criteria. In consequence, it is not able to represent interactions among criteria. For example, consider evaluation of cars using such criteria as maximum speed, acceleration and price. In this case, there may exist a negative interaction (negative synergy) between maximum speed and acceleration because a car with a high maximum speed also has a good acceleration, so, even if each of these two criteria is very important for a DM who likes sport cars, their joint impact on reinforcement of preference of a more speedy and better accelerating car over a less speedy and worse accelerating car will be smaller than a simple addition of the two impacts corresponding to each of the two criteria considered separately in validation of this preference relation. In the same decision problem, there may exist a positive interaction (positive synergy) between maximum speed and price because a car with a high maximum speed usually also has a high price, and thus a car with a high maximum speed and relatively low price is very much appreciated. Thus, the comprehensive impact of these two criteria on the strength of preference of a more speedy and cheaper car over a less speedy and more expensive car is greater than the impact of the two criteria considered separately in validation of this preference relation.To handle the interactions among criteria, one can consider non-additive integrals, such as Choquet integral and Sugeno integral (for a comprehensive survey on the use of non-additive integrals in MCDA see Grabisch, 1996). The non-additive integrals suffer, however, from some limitations within MCDA (Roy, 2009); in particular, they need that the evaluations on all criteria are expressed on the same scale. This means that in order to apply a non-additive integral it is necessary, for example, to estimate if the maximum speed of 200km/h is as valuable as the price of 35,000€.In this paper, we propose a new aggregation model which modifies the usual additive value function model so as to handle interactions among criteria without the necessity of expressing all the evaluations on the same scale. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce main concepts and notation. In Section 3, first we show by an example what means violation of the preferential independence hypothesis for an additive value function, and then we continue the same example to show that the well known Choquet integral is not able to represent properly the observed interaction between criteria. In Section 4, we recall basic concepts and properties of robust ordinal regression. Our main proposal, extending UTAGMSto the case of interacting criteria, is given in Section 5. It starts with a reminder of the principle of robust ordinal regression, and then continues with presentation of the UTAGMS–INT method. An illustrative example is provided in Section 6. The last section contains conclusions. All the proofs are deferred to the appendix.We are considering a multiple criteria decision problem where a finite set of alternativesA={a,b,c,…}(|A|=m) is evaluated on a family of n criteria{g1,…,gi,…,gn}(I={1,…n}). To simplify notation, we will identify the family of criteria with set I of their indices. The family of criteria is supposed to satisfy consistency conditions (Roy & Bouyssou, 1993), i.e., completeness (all relevant criteria are considered), monotonicity (the better the evaluation of an alternative on considered criteria, the more it is preferable to another), and non-redundancy (no superfluous criteria are considered).The set of all possible performances of alternatives on criteriongiis denoted byXi⊂R. Consequently,X=∏i=1nXiis the performance space. We assume thatXi=[xi∗,xi∗], i.e., the performance scale of each criteriongiis bounded such thatxi∗andxi∗are the worst and the best performances, such thatx∗=(x1∗,…,xn∗)andx∗=(x1∗,…,xn∗)are two vectors of the best and the worst performances, respectively. We assume, without loss of generality, that the greatergi(a), the better alternative a on criteriongi; in other words, for anya,b∈A, anyi∈I, performancegi(a)∈Xiis better than performancegi(b)∈Xiiffgi(a)>gi(b). Each vectorx=(x1,…,xn),x∈X, is called performance vector, which may correspond to an alternativea∈A.Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976) proposes to represent preferences of a Decision Maker (DM) on set A of alternatives by an overall value functionU:X→R, such that, for any pair of alternativesa,b∈A:a≿b⇔U(a)⩾U(b), whereU(a)andU(b)simplify the notationU(g1(a),…,gn(a))andU(g1(a),…,gn(a)), respectively, and ≿ is a weak preference relation on A, such that, for alla,b∈A,a≿bmeans “a is at least as good as b”. As the role of value function U is to aggregate vector performances of alternatives into a single real value, it is also called aggregation model or preference model.One of the most popular value functions is the multiple attribute additive model:(1)U(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a)),foranya∈A,whereuiis a non-decreasing marginal value function,i=1,…,n.It is well known that among basic axioms characterizing a multiple attribute additive value function (1), the most important is the hypothesis of preferential independence, which can be written as follows: for any subset of criteriaR⊆I, and for any alternativesa,b,c,d∈A, such that•gi(a)=gi(b)=xi1andgi(c)=gi(d)=xi2, for alli∈Randxi1,xi2∈Xi,gi(a)=gi(c)=xi3andgi(b)=gi(d)=xi4, for alli∈I⧹Randxi3,xi4∈Xi,a≿b⇒c≿d,which is equivalent toa≻b⇒c≻d,where ≻ is the asymmetric part of ≿, i.e.,a≻bmeans “a is preferred to b”.Let us explain, by an example inspired by Grabisch (1996), what means violation of the preferential independence hypothesis for an additive value function (1). Consider the case of a dean of some school that has to compare four students on the basis of their scores in Mathematics, Physics and Literature presented in Table 1. Here,Xi={Bad,Medium,Good},i∈I={math,phys,lit}.Imagine the following reasoning of the dean: “considering studentsS1andS2, I preferS1overS2because in case of good mathematicians a medium physicist is preferable for me more than a bad physicist, even if the first is bad in Literature and the second is medium in Literature; on the other hand, comparing studentsS3andS4, I preferS4overS3because in case of only medium mathematicians, I prefer a student who is better in Literature than in Physics”. We will show that preferringS1overS2, andS4overS3, the dean is violating the preferential independence. In fact, takingR={math}, we have•gi(S1)=gi(S2)=xi1andgi(S3)=gi(S4)=xi2, for alli∈Randxi1,xi2∈Xi, i.e.,gmath(S1)=gmath(S2)=Goodandgmath(S3)=gmath(S4)=Medium,gi(S1)=gi(S3)=xi3andgi(S2)=gi(S4)=xi4, for alli∈I⧹Randxi3,xi4∈Xi, i.e.,gphys(S1)=gphys(S3)=Mediumandgphys(S2)=gphys(S4)=Bad, andglit(S1)=glit(S3)=Badandglit(S2)=glit(S4)=Medium,Due to preference ofS1overS2we have(2)U(S1)=umath(Good)+uphys(Medium)+ulit(Bad)>umath(Good)+uphys(Bad)+ulit(Medium)=U(S2),while due to preference ofS4overS3we have(3)U(S4)=umath(Medium)+uphys(Bad)+ulit(Medium)>umath(Medium)+uphys(Medium)+ulit(Bad)=U(S3).From (2) we get(4)uphys(Medium)+ulit(Bad)>uphys(Bad)+ulit(Medium),while from (3) we get(5)uphys(Medium)+ulit(Bad)<uphys(Bad)+ulit(Medium).Inequalities (4) and (5) are apparently incompatible, and thus, the couple of criteria{phys,lit}is not preferentially independent in the family of three criteria{math,phys,lit}. This confirms that the dean’s preferences cannot be represented by a multiple attribute additive value function.The question arises, how to represent such a situation with a value function? The literature provides several proposals for handling interactions among criteria in preference modeling by value (utility) functions. Browsing the literature, one can observe that there are two groups of methods. One group of proposals constitutes an approach by decomposition and graphical representation of additive value functions under ceteris paribus assumption: these are GAI-networks (Gonzales & Perny, 2005) and UCP-networks (Boutilier, Bacchus, & Brafman, 2001). Another group of proposals consists in using a more advanced form of the value function than just additive; let us mention the multilinear utility function (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976), and the Choquet integral (Angilella, Greco, & Matarazzo, 2010; Choquet, 1953; Grabisch, 1996), considered to be more general than additive value functions.GAI-networks, as well as UCP-networks, rely on the idea of Generalized Additive Independence (GAI) decomposition introduced in Fishburn (1967) to allow representation of interactions between attributes while preserving decomposability of the value function. In the GAI model, the value function is the sum of marginal value functions, each one related to a subset of criteria, such that each criterion is considered in at least one marginal value function. GAI networks give a graphical representation of subsets of criteria for which there is a marginal value function. UCP-networks determine subsets of criteria considered in the GAI decomposition on the basis of a graphical model exploiting conditional preferential independence in structuring decision maker’s preferences under the ceteris paribus assumption.On the other hand, the multilinear utility function (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976) is expressed as a weighted sum of products of marginal utilities corresponding to single criteria, over all subsets of criteria. The Choquet integral can be seen in turn as an average of marginal values, not on the basis of weights assigned to each criterion, but on the basis of a capacity which assigns a weight to every subset of criteria. In this way, the Choquet integral takes into account interaction between criteria, and even distinguishes positive and negative synergy between criteria. For example, if between two criteria there is a positive synergy, the weight assigned to the two criteria considered together is greater than the sum of the weights of the two criteria considered separately. Negative synergy can be defined analogously.The model we are proposing in this paper, does not rely on graphical representation nor GAI decomposition of the additive value functions, and thus it is more directly comparable to multilinear utility function and the Choquet integral. More precisely:(a)if one considers couples of interacting criteria only (giving null weights to products of three or more marginal utilities), the multilinear utility model is a special case of our model where the positive or negative synergy related to a couple of criteria is represented by the product of marginal utilities multiplied by a positive or negative weight, respectively;if one considers a 2-additive capacity (Grabisch, 1997; Mayag, 2010), i.e., capacity in which only interaction of couples of criteria is considered, the Choquet integral is a special case of our model where the positive or negative synergy related to a couple of criteria is represented by the minimum value of the two marginal values multiplied by a positive or negative weight, respectively; the weight multiplying the minimum marginal value is the value that the Möbius representation of the capacity gives to the couples of criteria: it is equal to the value that the capacity gives to the two criteria considered together minus the sum of the values that the capacity gives to the two criteria considered separately.When using ordinal regression, the main problem of multilinear utility model and the Choquet integral model is that the marginal utilities cannot be determined using linear programming. In case, one would like to find a compatible model of this type using linear programming, the marginal utilities should have to be given as data of the problem. This is a strong hypothesis that one has to take into account in the interpretation of the results of application of these models in the ordinal regression approach (Angilella, Greco, Lamantia, & Matarazzo, 2004 for a discussion of this point with respect to the Choquet integral and for a heuristic to induce both the marginal value functions and a capacity compatible with the DM’s preference information).Within robust ordinal regression, the Choquet integral has been considered to represent interaction between criteria in Angilella et al. (2010). Of course, in this approach, marginal values were also considered as given. This limitation has to be considered together with other weak points of the Choquet integral recalled at the end of this section.Let us focus on the Choquet representation of interactions. Let2Ibe the power set of I (i.e., all the subsets of the set of criteria I); a fuzzy measure (capacity) on I is defined as a set functionμ:2I→[0,1]which satisfies the following properties:(1a)μ(∅)=0andμ(I)=1(boundary conditions),∀R′⊆R⊆I,μ(R′)⩽μ(R)(monotonicity condition).In the framework of MCDA, the value of capacityμ(R)on a subset of criteriaR⊆Icorresponds to the importance weight given by the DM to the set of criteria R. The Choquet integral is based on the hypothesis of commensurability, which states that it is possible to comparegi(a)withgj(b)for alli,j∈Iand for alla,b∈Ausing a preference relation≿I, such thatgi(a)≿Igj(b)means “gi(a)is at least as good asgj(b)”. This implies that there exists a value functionu:⋃i∈IXi→R+, such thatugi(a)⩾ugj(b)⇔gi(a)≿Igj(b)for alli,j∈Iand for alla,b∈A. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that u is defined on[0,1], rather than onR.Supposing that the hypothesis of commensurability is satisfied and function u exists, given alternativea∈Aand capacityμdefined on I, the Choquet integral (Choquet, 1953) is defined as:(6)Cμ(a)=∑i=1nug(i)(a)-ug(i-1)(a)μRi,where (·) stands for a permutation of the indices of performances of alternative a on particular criteria, such that:(7)g(n)(a)≿Ig(n-1)(a)≿I⋯≿Ig(1)(a),i.e.,(8)ug(n)(a)⩾ug(n-1)(a)⩾⋯⩾ug(1)(a),u(g(0))=0andRi=(i),…,(n),i=1,…,n.Coming back to our example, in order to apply the Choquet integral, one has to define function u. Having no a priori reason to distinguish between numerical codes of performances Bad, Medium, Good on math, phys, lit, we assume that they do not depend on the criterion, i.e.,u:{Bad,Medium,Good}→[0,1].For example, one can setu(Good)=1,u(Medium)=0.5andu(Bad)=0. The scores of the students expressed in this common numeric scale are the ones shown in Table 2.Let us show that the Choquet integral is not able to represent the dean’s preferences for any order-preserving numerical codification of function u and for any values of capacityμ. In fact,S1≻S2and, consequentlyCμ(S1)>Cμ(S2), implies(9)[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,phys})+[u(Good)-u(Medium)]×μ({math})>[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,lit})+[u(Good)-u(Medium)]×μ({math}),which boils down to(10)[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,phys})>[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,lit}).Analogously,S4≻S3andCμ(S4)>Cμ(S3)imply(11)[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,lit})>[u(Medium)-u(Bad)]×μ({math,phys}).Since (10) and (11) are clearly incompatible, we have to conclude that there is no capacityμand no order-preserving numerical codification u of the three performances{Bad,Medium,Good}– without distinction of criteria – that would permit to represent the dean’s preferences by the Choquet integral.To cope with such a hard case of preference representation, one can consider some generalization of the Choquet integral. For example, one can use the Choquet integral with respect to a level dependent capacity (Greco, Matarazzo, & Giove, 2011) or the bipolar Choquet integral (Grabisch & Labreuche, 2005; Labreuche & Grabisch, 2006) (see also Greco, Matarazzo, & Słowiński (2002)). Let us analyze the above example using this latter integral.Consider setQ={(A,B):A,B⊆I,A∩B=∅}, and bicapacity functionμb:Q→[-1,1]satisfying the following properties:1.μb(∅,∅)=0,μb(I,∅)=1,μb(∅,I)=-1,for all(A,B),(C,D)∈Qsuch thatA⊆CandB⊇D,μb(A,B)⩽μ(C,D).The bipolar Choquet integral of the vector of evaluations for studenta∈Ag(a)=g1(a),…,gn(a)∈Rnwith respect to the bicapacityμbis given byChb(g(a),μb)=∑i=1n(|g(i)(a)|-|g(i-1)(a)|)μb({j∈I:gj(a)>|g(i-1)(a)|},{i∈I:gj(a)<-|g(i-1)(a)|}),where (·) is the permutation of indicesi=1,…,n, such that|g(1)(a)|⩽|g(2)(a)|⩽…⩽|g(n)(a)|and|g(0)(a)|=0.If we would consider the numerical codification of Table 3, the bipolar Choquet integral would give the following values to the four studentsS1,S2,S3andS4:Chb(S1,μb)=(u(Good)-u(Medium))×μb({math},{lit})=μb({math},{lit}),Chb(S2,μb)=(u(Good)-u(Medium))×μb({math},{phys})=μb({math},{phys}),Chb(S3,μb)=(|u(Bad)|-u(Medium))×μb(∅,{lit})=μb(∅,{lit}),Chb(S4,μb)=(|u(Bad)|-u(Medium))×μb(∅,{phys})=μb(∅,{phys}).Thus, fromS1≻S2, we getChb(S1,μb)>Chb(S2,μb), and, consequently,(12)μb({math},{lit})>μb({math},{phys}),while fromS4≻S3, we getChb(S4,μb)>Chb(S3,μb), and, consequently,(13)μb(∅,{lit})<μb(∅,{phys}).This time, (12) and (13) are not contradictory, so we can conclude that the bipolar Choquet integral can represent the dean’s preferences. Observe, however, that apart from being much more complex than the basic Choquet integral, the bipolar Choquet integral shares the same problems of the basic Choquet integral, i.e.,:1.Problems with respect to numerical codification. How to transform performances on criteria into numerical values? Moreover, how to express all performances on considered criteria using a single value scale in order to ensure full commensurability? This requires the DM to answer questions like: “is maximum speed of 180km/h worth a fuel consumption of 12l/100km”?Problems with respect to non-additive weights (capacity). What kind of preference information should be elicited by the DM in order to arrive at the capacities? Is there an intelligible relation between the preference information provided by the DM and the obtained value of the capacity?Problems with respect to interpretation of the Choquet integral. Is it possible to clearly justify preference of alternative a over alternative b in terms of values of the integral’s components (Roy, 2009)?Applying a set of additive value functions compatible with preference information provided by the DM to multiple criteria ranking problems was implemented first in UTAGMS(Greco et al., 2008) and GRIP (Figueira, Greco, & Słowiński, 2009) methods. These methods consist of three steps. They start with the preference elicitation process, lead through the statement of appropriate ordinal regression problems, i.e., definition of the set of compatible general additive value functions, and result in calculation of the necessary and possible preference relations on the set of all alternatives. In the following subsections, we recall major steps of the GRIP method.The DM is expected to provide preference information on a setA′of reference alternatives. These alternatives should be known by the DM well enough so that she/he is able to express preferences confidently with respect to them. For the purpose of normalization, we include inA′the vectorsx∗andx∗of extreme performances. The cardinality ofA′is denoted bym′. The expressed preferences have the following form:•A partial preorder ≿ on a set of reference alternativesA′, whose meaning is: fora′,b′∈A′,a′≿b′⇔“a′is at least as good asb′”. Moreover, ≻ (preference) is the asymmetric part of ≿ and ∼ (indifference) is the symmetric part given by≿∩≿-1(≿-1is the inverse of ≿, i.e., for alla′,b′∈A′,a′≿-1b′⇔b′≿a′).A partial preorder≿∗onA′×A′, whose meaning is: fora′,b′,c′,d′∈A′,(a′,b′)≿∗(c′,d′)⇔“a′is preferred tob′at least as much asc′is preferred tod′”.Also in this case,≻∗is the asymmetric part of≿∗and∼∗is the symmetric part given by≿∗∩≿∗-1(≿∗-1is the inverse of≿∗, i.e., for alla′,b′,c′,d′∈A′,(a′,b′)≿∗-1(c′,d′)⇔(c′,d′)≿∗(a′,b′)).A partial preorder≿i∗onA′×A′, whose meaning is: fora′,b′,c′,d′∈A′,(a′,b′)≿i∗(c′,d′)⇔“a′is preferred tob′at least as much asc′is preferred tod′on criteriongi,i∈I”.Although the value function U is defined onX=∏i=1nXi, in the following linear programs, in order to simplify notation, we will writeU(a),a∈A, instead ofU(g1(a),…,gn(a)), wheregi(a)∈Xi,i=1,…,n. Formally, to be compatible with the above preference information, the general additive value function (1) has to satisfy the following setEU≿of constraints.(14)U(a′)⩾U(b′)+εifa′≻b′U(a′)=U(b′)ifa′∼b′U(a′)-U(b′)⩾U(c′)-U(d′)if(a′,b′)≿∗(c′,d′)ui(gi(a′))-ui(gi(b′))⩾ui(gi(c′))-ui(gi(d′)),if(a′,b′)≿i∗(c′,d′),i=1,…,nforalla′,b′,c′,d′∈A′,(15)ui(gi(a))-ui(gi(b))⩾0,ifgi(a)>gi(b),i=1,…,n,foralla,b∈A,(16)ui(gi(a))-ui(gi(b))=0,ifgi(a)=gi(b),i=1,…,n,foralla,b∈A,(17)ui(xi∗)=0,i=1,…,n,(18)U(x1∗,…,xn∗)=1,whereε>0. Constraints (14) correspond to preference statements of the DM. (15) and (16) ensure monotonicity of U, and (17) and (18) impose normalization. The set of compatible value functionsU≿is not empty ifEU≿is feasible andε★=maxε,s.t.EU≿, is greater than 0.1Observe that here and always in the following, differently from the canonical form of the linear programming problem, we considerεas a variable that can assume also negative values.1On the basis of the set of all value functionsU≿compatible with preference information provided by the DM, two binary relations on all pairs of alternativesa,b∈Aare defined:–necessary weak preference relationa≿Nb, iffU(a)⩾U(b)for all value functionsU∈U≿,possible weak preference relationa≿Pb, iff there existsU∈U≿such thatU(a)⩾U(b).As, for a given pair of alternativesa,b∈A, the necessary preference relationa≿Nbholds iff there is noU∈U≿such thatU(b)>U(a), thena≿Nbif the following linear programN(a,b)is not feasible orεN★≤0, whereεN★denotes a maximal value of the objectiveεinN(a,b):Maximize:εsubjecttoU(b)⩾U(a)+εconstraints(14)–(18)N(a,b).IfN(a,b)is not feasible orεN★≤0, then there does not exist any compatible value functionU∈U≿for whichU(b)>U(a); in consequence, the necessary preference relationa≿Nbholds, because all compatible value functions giveU(a)⩾U(b).In order to check ifa≿Pb, we have to consider a new linear program, calledP(a,b), which is obtained from problemN(a,b)replacing the first constraint byU(a)⩾U(b). IfP(a,b)is feasible andεP★>0, whereεP★denotes a maximal value of the objectiveεinP(a,b), then there exists a compatible value functionU∈U≿for whichU(a)⩾U(b)and, in consequence, the possible preference relationa≿Pbholds.As to properties of ≿Nand ≿Pon A, let us remind after (Greco et al., 2008) that:•≿Nis a partial preorder on A,≿N⊆≿P,a≿Nbandb≿Pc⇒a≿Pc,∀a,b,c∈A,a≿Pbandb≿Nc⇒a≿Pc,∀a,b,c∈A,a≿Nborb≿Pa,∀a,b∈A.The above properties are the minimal ones characterizing ≿Nand ≿P(Giarlotta & Greco, 2013). Other interesting properties of ≿Nand ≿Pare the following (Greco et al., 2008):•≿Pis strongly complete and negatively transitive,≻Pis complete, irreflexive and transitive.On the other hand, one can also calculate necessary and possible quaternary relations between intensities of preference for pairs of alternatives(a,b),(c,d)∈A×A, defined as:–necessary weak preference intensity relation(a,b)≿∗N(c,d), iffU(a)-U(b)⩾U(c)-U(d)for all value functionsU∈U≿,possible weak preference intensity relation(a,b)≿∗P(c,d), iffU(a)-U(b)⩾U(c)-U(d)for at least one value functionU∈U≿.Analogically toa≿Nb, for given pairs of alternatives(a,b),(c,d)∈A×A, the necessary preference intensity relation(a,b)≿∗N(c,d)holds iff there is noU∈U≿such thatU(c)-U(d)>U(a)-U(b), and then(a,b)≿∗N(c,d)ifN(a,b,c,d)is not feasible orεˆN★≤0, whereN(a,b,c,d)is the linear program analogical toN(a,b)in which the first constraint ofN(a,b)is replaced byU(c)-U(d)⩾U(a)-U(b)+ε, andεˆN★denotes the maximal value of the objectiveεinN(a,b,c,d).Analogically again, in order to check if(a,b)≿∗P(c,d), we have to consider a new problemP(a,b,c,d)which is obtained from problemN(a,b)after replacing the first constraint byU(a)-U(b)⩾U(c)-U(d). IfP(a,b,c,d)is feasible andεˆP★>0, whereεˆP★denotes the maximal value of the objectiveεinP(a,b,c,d), then there exists a compatible value functionU∈U≿for whichU(a)-U(b)⩾U(c)-U(d)and, in consequence, the possible preference relation(a,b)≿∗P(c,d)holds.The assumed preference model is a value function equal to not only the sum of marginal non-decreasing value functionsui,i=1,…,n, as considered in UT AGMSand in GRIP, but also adding the sum of functionssyni1,i2+:[xi1∗,xi1∗]×[xi2∗,xi2∗]→[0,1], and subtracting the sum of functionssyni1,i2-:[xi1∗,xi1∗]×[xi2∗,xi2∗],{i1,i2}⊆I. Functionssyni1,i2+(xi1,xi2)andsyni1,i2-(xi1,xi2)are non-decreasing in both their two arguments, and such that(19)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)=0,syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)=0,for all couples of (possibly) interacting criteria{i1,i2}⊆I. They correspond to positive and negative interactions, respectively, and add to or subtract from the additive component of the value function. This is why one can call them bonus and penalty functions with respect to the main additive component.The bonus and penalty componentssyni1,i2+(·,·)andsyni1,i2-(·,·)can be used to model interactions in a value function defined as follows:(20)Uint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}⊆Isyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-∑{i1,i2}⊆Isyni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a)).Value functionUintshould satisfy usual conditions of value functions, i.e.,•boundary conditions:Uint(a)=0ifgi(a)=xi∗,∀i∈I, andUint(a)=1ifgi(a)=xi∗,∀i∈I,monotonicity:Uint(a)⩾Uint(b)ifgi(a)⩾gi(b),∀i∈I, anda,b∈A.Observe that from boundary conditions and monotonicity conditions we also haveUint(a)⩾0,foralla∈A.To avoid that due to mutual compensation, bonus componentssyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))and penalty componentssyni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a)),{i1,i2}⊆I, could take arbitrarily great values, we introduce a constraint on their maximum value(21)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρ,syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρ,for all{i1,i2}⊆I, whereρ≥0is, e.g., equal to 1.We assume that the monotonicity also holds for any subset J of I, i.e., for alla,b∈A, such thatgi(a)⩾gi(b)for alli∈J,(22)∑i∈Jui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}∈Jsyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾∑i∈Jui(gi(b))+∑{i1,i2}∈Jsyni1,i2+(gi1(b),gi2(b))-syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)).The monotonicity condition ofUintcorresponds to the condition (22) forJ=I. Observe that conditions (22) are very numerous:2n-1for each pair of alternatives(a,b)∈A×Asuch that a dominates b. One could claim that condition (22) is not necessary and that the following simpler condition on couples of criteria would be enough to ensure the monotonicity ofUint: for all{i1,i2}⊆Iand for alla,b∈A, such thatgi1(a)⩾gi1(b)andgi2(a)⩾gi2(b):(23)ui1(gi1(a))+ui2(gi2(a))+syni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾ui1(gi1(b))+ui2(gi2(b))+syni1,i2+(gi1(b),gi2(b))-syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)).Condition (23) says that improvement of performances on criteriagi1andgi2,{i1,i2}⊆I, cannot result in deterioration of the value component concerning these two criteria. However, condition (23) does not prevent that improvement of performances on criteriagi1,gi2andgi3,{i1,i2,i3}⊆I, can result in deterioration of the utility component concerning these three criteria, as shown by the following example. Suppose that fora,b∈Aandi1,i2,i3∈I,adominates b, i.e.,gi1(a)⩾gi1(b),gi2(a)⩾gi2(b)andgi3(a)⩾gi3(b). Suppose also that:ui1(gi1(a))=ui2(gi2(a))=0.3,ui3(gi3(a))=ui1(gi1(b))=ui2(gi2(b))=ui3(gi3(b))=0.2,syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))=syni1,i3-(gi1(a),gi3(a))=0.25,syni2,i3-(gi2(a),gi3(a))=0,syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b))=0.1,syni1,i3-(gi1(b),gi3(b))=0.16,syni2,i3-(gi2(b),gi3(b))=0,syni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))=syni,i′+(gi(b),gi′(b))=0,forall{i,i′}∈{i1,i2},{i1,i3},{i2,i3}.In this case, even if condition (23) is satisfied for all three couples of criteria{i1,i2},{i1,i3}and{i2,i3}, we have∑i∈{i1,i2,i3}ui(gi(a))+∑{i,i′}∈{i1,i2},{i1,i3},{i2,i3}syni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))-syni,i′-(gi(a),gi′(a))⩽∑i∈{i1,i2,i3}ui(gi(b))+∑{i,i′}∈{i1,i2},{i1,i3},{i2,i3}syni,i′+(gi(b),gi′(b))-syni,i′-(gi(b),gi′(b)).It follows that condition (22) has to be satisfied for all subsetsJ⊆I. This observation does not only imply many monotonicity constraints, but also a hardly interpretable value functionUintwhen any criterion interacts simultaneously with several other criteria. For this reason, we propose to allow any criterion to interact with only one other. This assumption makes the construction of the value functionUintmore manageable, and its interpretation more straightforward. In mathematical terms, this means that for alli∈I, if for some otheri′∈Iand for somea∈A, we havesyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))≠0orsyni,i′-(gi(a),gi′(a))≠0, thensyni,i″+(gi(b),gi″(b))=0orsyni,i″-(gi(b),gi″(b))=0, for allb∈Aandi″∈I-{i,i′}. Under this restriction on the possibility of interaction, condition (23) ensures the monotonicity of value functionUint. Indeed, denoting by Syn the set of all the couples{i1,i2}of interacting criteria from I, i.e.,Syn={{i1,i2}⊆I:syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))≠0orsyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))≠0forsomea∈A},for alla∈Awe haveUint(a)=∑i∈Iui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}∈Synsyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))=∑i∉⋃{i1,i2}∈Syn{i1,i2}ui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}∈Synui1(gi1(a))+ui2(gi2(a))+syni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))with the addends in the first sum non-decreasing with respect to the performancesgi(a),i∉⋃{i1,i2}∈Syn{i1,i2}, by definition, and the addends in the second sum non-decreasing with respect to the performancesgi1(a),gi2(a),{i1,i2}∈Syn, by condition (23). Observe moreover that condition (19), together with the condition thatui(xi∗)=0for alli∈I, ensures thatUint(x1∗,…,xn∗)=0.It is reasonable to consider the following options for the presence of interaction components in the value function (20) for all couples{i1,i2}⊆I:(α)syni1,i2+(·,·)andsyni1,i2-(·,·)are not mutually exclusive, so that positive and negative synergies interplay such that in some regions of the performance space of the two criteria a positive synergy prevails, and in some others a negative synergy prevails or, even, there is no synergy,syni1,i2+(·,·)andsyni1,i2-(·,·)are mutually exclusive,only one of the two synergies is considered, either the positive (option γ+), or the negative (option γ−).In case of option (α), to be compatible with the DM’s preference information, the value functionUintshould satisfy the following setEUint≿,αof mixed integer linear programming constraints:(24)Uint(a′)⩾Uint(b′)+εifa′≻b′Uint(a′)=Uint(b′)ifa′∼b′Uint(a′)-Uint(b′)⩾Uint(c′)-Uint(d′)if(a′,b′)≿∗(c′,d′)ui(gi(a′))-ui(gi(b′))⩾ui(gi(c′))-ui(gi(d′)),if(a′,b′)≿i∗(c′,d′),i∈Ia′,b′,c′,d′∈A′,(25)ui(gi(a))-ui(gi(b))⩾0,ifgi(a)>gi(b),i=1,…,n,a,b∈A,(26)ui(gi(a))-ui(gi(b))=0,ifgi(a)=gi(b),i=1,…,n,a,b∈A,(27)ui(xi∗)=0,i=1,…,n,(28)Uint(x1∗,…,xn∗)=1,(29)syni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾syni1,i2+(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}⊆I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)⩾gi1(b)andgi2(a)⩾gi2(b),(30)syni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))=syni1,i2+(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}⊆I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)=gi1(b)andgi2(a)=gi2(b),(31)syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}⊆I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)⩾gi1(b)andgi2(a)⩾gi2(b),(32)syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))=syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}⊆I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)=gi1(b)andgi2(a)=gi2(b),(33)ui1(gi1(a))+ui2(gi2(a))+syni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾ui1(gi1(b))+ui2(gi2(b))+syni1,i2+(gi1(b),gi2(b))-syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}⊆I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)⩾gi1(b)andgi2(a)⩾gi2(b),(34)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)=0,{i1,i2}⊆I,(35)syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)=0,{i1,i2}⊆I,(36)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ργi1,i2,forall{i1,i2}⊆I,(37)syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ργi1,i2,forall{i1,i2}⊆I,(38)∑i2∈I-i1γi1,i2⩽1foreachi1∈I,(39)γi1,i2∈{0,1},forall{i1,i2}⊆I,whereε>0andρ≥0is a limiting constant threshold, e.g.,ρ=1.Constraints (24) correspond to preference statements of the DM. Let us denote by k the number of these constraints, i.e., the DM gives k pieces of preference information. (25) and (26) ensure monotonicity of the non-interacting part ofUint. (27) and (28) imposes normalization of value functionUint, and (29)–(32) ensure monotonicity of the bonus and penalty functions, i.e., the interacting part ofUint, (33) ensure monotonicity of the part ofUintcorresponding to interacting pairs of criteria, i.e., those pairs for which the negative interaction components may be non-zero. Conditions (34) and (35) impose the lower bound normalization ofsyni1,i2+andsyni1,i2-, respectively. Conditions (36)–(39) impose upper bound normalization (21) ofsyni1,i2+andsyni1,i2-and ensure that each criterioni1∈Iinteracts with at most one other criterioni2∈I. More precisely, considering that for (39)γi1,i2is a binary variable, criteriai1andi2interact ifγi1,i2=1, and do not interact ifγi1,i2=0,{i1,i2}⊆I. For conditions (36) and (37), ifi1andi2interact, than the bonussyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))and the penaltysyni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))cannot be greater than the thresholdρfor anya∈A. Condition (38) says that each criterioni1∈Ican interact with at most one other criterioni2∈I. Observe that conditions (30) could be removed because they can be obtained from conditions (29). Analogously, conditions (32) could be removed because they can be obtained from conditions (31). We are keeping these conditions, however, for the sake of clear formulation. The setU≿,αintof compatible value functionsUintis not empty ifEUint≿,αis feasible, i.e., ifεα>0whereεα=maxε,s.t.EUint≿,α. It is recommended to perform a kind of robustness analysis with respect to the value ofρ. Observing that ifEUint≿,αis feasible for someρ, then it is also feasible for anyρ′⩾ρ, one could determine a minimal valueραfor whichEUint≿,αis feasible by fixing a small value ofεand computingρα=minρ,s.t.EUint≿,α. In general, it is advisable to fixρat the value equal to or slightly greater thanρα, or in any case select a value ofρthat minimally differs fromρα, because this implies the minimization of the synergy between criteria in favor of a simpler preference representation that is closer to the classical additive value functionU(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a)).To adopt option (β), i.e., positive and negative synergy are mutually exclusive, it is necessary to introduce, for each couple{i1,i2}⊆I, two binary variablesδi1i2+andδi1i2-defined as follows:(40)δi1i2+=1iffi1andi2arepositivelyinteracting,δi1i2+=0otherwise,δi1i2-=1iffi1andi2arenegativelyinteracting,δi1i2-=0otherwise.Option (β) says that variablesδi1i2+andδi1i2-cannot be simultaneously equal to 1, which is equivalent to the following constraint:(41)δi1i2++δi1i2-⩽1,forall{i1,i2}⊆I.Constraint (41), together with following constraints, ensures that only one ofsyni1,i2+andsyni1,i2-can assume a value greater than zero:(42)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρδi1i2+,forall{i1,i2}⊆I,(43)syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρδi1i2-,forall{i1,i2}⊆I.Observe that constraints (42) and (43) replace constraints (36) and (37) in case of option (β).Using variablesδi1i2+andδi1i2-,{i1,i2}⊆I, we can reformulate constraints (38) as follows:(44)∑i2∈I-i1δi1,i2++δi1,i2-⩽1foralli1∈I.Observe that if condition (44) is respected, then also condition (41) holds and thus, adopting (44), we do not need (41) anymore.Obviously, condition (39) has to be substituted by condition(45)δi1,i2+,δi1,i2-∈{0,1}forall{i1,i2}∈I.Adding constraints (42)–(45) instead of constraints (36)–(39) from set of constraintsEUint≿,α, we get the set of constraintsEUint≿,β. A value functionUintis compatible with the DM’s preference information in case of option (β) if it satisfies the setEUint≿,βof linear programming constraints withε>0. Thus, the setU≿,αintof compatible value functionsUintis not empty, ifEUint≿,βis feasible, i.e., ifεβ>0, whereεβ=maxε, s.t.EUint≿,β. Also in this case, it can be useful to determineρβ, being the minimal value ofρfor whichEUint≿,βis feasible, by fixing a small value ofεand computingρβ=minρ,s.t.EUint≿,β.In case of option (γ), if only positive synergy is considered, for alla∈A, the value function is defined as(46)Uint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}⊆Isyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a)),while, if only negative synergy is considered, we have(47)Uint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))-∑{i1,i2}⊆Isyni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a)).Adopting option (γ), the following constraints have to be removed from the set of constraintsEUint≿,α:•if only positive synergies are considered, constraints (31), (32), (35) and (37) can be removed,if only negative synergies are considered, constraints (29), (30), (34) and (36) can be removed.Moreover, for the absence of bonus functionsyni1,i2+, when considering negative synergies only, constraint (33) has to be reformulated as follows:(48)ui1(gi1(a))+ui2(gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a))⩾ui1(gi1(b))+ui2(gi2(b))-syni1,i2-(gi1(b),gi2(b)),{i1,i2}∈I,foralla,b∈A,ifgi1(a)⩾gi1(b)andgi2(a)⩾gi2(b).When considering positive synergies only, constraint (33) can be completely removed as it is always satisfied for the monotonicity ofui1,ui2andsyni1,i2+. Summing up,•when considering positive synergies only, the set of constraintsEUint≿,γ+is obtained by removing constraints (31), (32), (35), (37) and (33) from set of constraintsEUint≿,α,when considering negative synergies only, the set of constraintsEUint≿,γ-is obtained by removing constraints (29), (30), (34) and (36) from set of constraintsEUint≿,αand by replacing constraints (33) by (48).Observe, moreover, that in case of option (γ+), i.e., when only positive synergies are considered, due to monotonicity of marginal value functionsui,i∈I, and synergiessyni1,i2+,{i1,i2}∈I, monotonicity (22) always holds for any subset J of I and, consequently, we can relax the limitation that each criterion can interact with at most one other criterion. Therefore, in case of option (γ+), if interactions of any criterion with more than one other criterion are accepted, one can also remove constraints (38).To be compatible with the DM’s preference information in case of option (γ), when only positive synergies are considered, the value functionUintshould satisfy setEUint≿,γ+of linear programming constraints withε>0. In this case, setU≿,γ+intof compatible value functionsUintis not empty ifEUint≿,γ+is feasible, i.e., ifεγ+>0withεγ+=maxε, s.t.EUint≿,γ+. Analogously, when only negative synergies are considered, the value functionUintshould satisfy setEUint≿,γ-of linear programming constraints withε>0, and the setU≿,γ-intof compatible value functionsUintis not empty, ifEUint≿,γ-is feasible, i.e., ifεγ->0withεγ-=maxε, s.t.EUint≿,γ-. Also in these cases it can be useful to determine the minimal valueρfor whichEUint≿,γ+orEUint≿,γ-is feasible subject to a fixed small value ofε, i.e., minimizingρ,s.t.EUint≿,γ+ors.t.EUint≿,γ-.Table 4details the number of variables and constraints defining the set of compatible value functions for the (α), (β) and (γ) options. In fact, Table 4 gives an upper bound on the number of constraints, because using monotonicity of marginal value functionsui,i∈I, and synergiessyni1,i2+,syni1,i2-,{i1,i2}⊆I, one can reduce the number constraints given in Table 4. Indeed, if fora,b,c∈Aand{i1,i2}⊆I, we havegi1(a)⩽gi1(b)⩽gi1(c)andgi2(a)⩽gi2(b)⩽gi2(c), considering constraints (29), we can skip the constraintsyni1,i2+(g1(a),g2(a))⩽syni1,i2+(g1(c),g2(c))because it is implied by the two other constraintssyni1,i2+(g1(a),g2(a))⩽syni1,i2+(g1(b),g2(b))andsyni1,i2+(g1(b),g2(b))⩽syni1,i2+(g1(c),g2(c)).Analogous arguments hold for constraints (31), (33) and (48).It is natural to ask wether there is a relationship between representability of DM’s preference relation ≿ in case of options (α), (β) and (γ). The following results give an answer to this question.Proposition 1For a fixed value ofρ≥0,(1)ifU≿,βint≠∅, thenU≿,αint≠∅,ifU≿,γ-int≠∅, thenU≿,βint≠∅,ifU≿,γ+int≠∅, thenU≿,βint≠∅,ifU≿,γ-int≠∅, thenU≿,αint≠∅,ifU≿,γ+int≠∅, thenU≿,αint≠∅.♢(1)If there exists a value ofρα≥0for whichU≿,αint≠∅, then there existsργ+⩾ραfor whichU≿,γ+int≠∅.If there exists a value ofρβ≥0for whichU≿,βint≠∅, then there existsργ+⩾ρβfor whichU≿,γ+int≠∅.If there exists a value ofρα≥0for whichU≿,αint≠∅, then there existsρβ⩾ραfor whichU≿,βint≠∅.♢Propositions 1 and 2 can be synthesized by saying that DM’s preference relation ≿ can be represented for option (α) and (β) if they can be represented for option (γ) when only bonuses are considered. Observe, however, that the value functionUγ+intfor option (γ), with bonuses only, could require a “greater presence” of the synergy components as witnessed by the fact thatργ+⩾ρβ⩾ρα. Therefore, if there is no specific wish from the DM, we would recommend using option (γ+) for the sake of simplicity. Let us remember that in case of option (γ+) one can also relax the limitation that each criterion can interact with at most only one other criterion, which also speaks in favor of this option.Until now we have considered monotonicity of value functionUinton the set A of considered alternatives. Let us now discuss monotonicity of value functionUinton the whole Cartesian product of the scales of the criteria, i.e., the performance spaceX=Πi=1nXi. The following example illustrates the problem. Let us consider two criteriag1andg2, and let us suppose that the scale of the two criteria (i.e., the set of values taken by the two criteria) is the following: {bad, medium, good, very good}. Suppose that in A there are two alternatives, a and b, having the following evaluations on the two considered criteria:g1(a)=good,g2(a)=medium,g1(b)=medium,g2(b)=good. Suppose, moreover, that the preferences on set A are represented by value functionUintof the type:Uint(x)=u1(x1)+u2(x2)-syn1,2-(x1,x2),i.e., as considered in option (β) or (γ−), or (α) in the extreme case where a negative interaction exists on all the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi. Now, suppose that we haveu1(medium)=u2(medium)=0.2,u1(good)=u2(good)=0.5,syn1,2-(good,medium)=0.05,syn1,2-(medium,good)=0.4.Then, we haveUint(a)=Uint(good,medium)=u1(good)+u2(medium)-syn1,2-(good,medium)=0.5+0.2-0.05=0.65,Uint(b)=Uint(medium,good)=u1(medium)+u2(good)-syn1,2-(medium,good)=0.2+0.5-0.4=0.3.Now, suppose that we want to extend functionUinton the Cartesian product space:{bad,medium,good,verygood}×{bad,medium,good,verygood}.For the monotonicity ofsyn1,2-we must have thatsyn1,2-(good,good)⩾syn1,2-(medium,good)=0.4,and thus we getUint(good,good)=u1(good)+u2(good)-syn1,2-(good,good)=0.5+0.5-syn1,2-(good,good)⩽0.5+0.5-0.4=0.6,such thatUint(good,good)⩽0.6<0.65=Uint(medium,good),which violates the monotonicity. This means that if a value functionUintbeing monotonic with respect to alternatives from A has been elicited, there is no certainty that the same value function is monotonic when a new alternativea′is added to A and therefore, in general, one should verify ifUintcontinues to be monotonic also with respect toA∪{a′}. Observe, however, that the DM could be satisfied with the monotonicity on the set of alternatives A, without requiring the stronger monotonicity on the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi. Indeed, the DM’s preference model refers to considered set A of (real or fictitious) alternatives having evaluations inX=Πi=1nXi, so it is not surprising that it may become wrong when another set of alternative is considered by the same DM. Nevertheless, to make our study more complete we propose below how to deal with requirement of monotonicity in the whole Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi. First, remark that among the options considered for the presence of interaction components in the value function (20), there is option (γ+) that ensures monotonicity in the whole Cartesian product space. In fact, as stated by the following proposition, any value functionUintbeing monotonic on A can be extended to the whole Cartesian productX=Πi=1nXirespecting the monotonicity.Let us consider a value functionUint:A→RUint(a)=u1(g1(a))+⋯+u2(g2(a))+∑{i,i′}∈Synsyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a)),∀a∈A,An extension ofUint:A→RtoA′,A⊆A′⊆Πi=1nXiis a value functionUint′(x)=u1′(x1)+⋯+u2′(x2)+∑{i,i′}∈Synsyni,i′+′(xi,xi′),∀(x1,…,xn)∈A′that respects the monotonicity and, for alla∈A, satisfies the following conditions(FV)(Faithfulness of marginal Value functions)ui′(gi(a))=ui(gi(a))for alli∈I,(Faithfulness of Synergy functions)syni,i′+′(gi(a),gi′(a))=syni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))for all{i,i′}∈Syn,Any value functionUint:A→RUint(a)=u1(g1(a))+…+u2(g2(a))+∑{i,i′}⊆Isyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a)),∀a∈Ahas a setUintof extensionsUint′:Πi=1nXi→RofUintto the Cartesian productΠi=1nXi. More precisely, the extensions ofUinttoΠi=1nXiare all and only value functionsUint′:Πi=1nXi→Rsuch that(FVI)for alli∈I,ui′(·)is a non-decreasing function such that for allxi∈Xi,ui∗(xi)=maxui(gi(a)):gi(a)⩽xi,a∈A⩽ui′(xi)⩽minui(gi(a)):gi(a)⩾xi,a∈A=ui∗(xi),for all{i,i′}∈I,syni,i′+′(·,·)is a non-decreasing function in both its two arguments such that for allxi∈Xiandxi′∈Xi′,syni,i′∗+(xi,xi′)=maxsyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a)):gi(a)⩽xi,gi′(a)⩽xi′,a∈A⩽syni,i′+′(xi,xi′)⩽minsyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a)):gi(a)⩾xi,gi′(a)⩾xi′,a∈A=syni,i′+∗(xi,xi′).♢Some remarks are in order:•Proposition 3 holds also when not all couples{i,i′}⊆Iinteract, but only a subsetSyn+of couples. In this case, for all{i,i′}∉Syn+we havesyni,i′+(xi,xi′)=syni,i′+′(xi,xi′)=0,∀xi∈Xi,xi′∈Xi′;notice that among the conditions of Proposition 3 there is no restriction that each criteriongican interact with only one other criteriongi′,i,i′∈I;Proposition 3 can be generalized to the case where not only couples but subsetsJ⊆Iof criteria of any cardinality greater than one can interact. Indeed, any value functionUint:A→Rof the typeUint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))+∑J⊆IsynJ+(gi(a),i∈J),withsynJ+being a function non-decreasing in each its arguments can be extended toΠi=1nXiby means of a value functionUint′Uint′(a)=∑i=1nui′(gi(a))+∑J⊆IsynJ+′(gi(a),i∈J)such that besides above condition (FVI), the following generalization of condition (FSI) is satisfied(FSIG) for allJ⊆I,synJ+′is a non-decreasing function in all its|J|arguments such that, for all(xi1,…,xi|J|)∈Πr=1|J|Xir,{i1,…,i|J|}=J,synJ∗+(xi1,…,xi|J|)=maxsynJ+(gi1(a),…,gi|J|(a)):gi1(a)⩽xi1,…,gi|J|(a)⩽xi|J|,a∈A⩽synJ+′(xi1,…,xi|J|)⩽minsynJ+(gi1(a),…,gi|J|(a)):gi1(a)⩾xi1,…,gi|J|(a)⩾xi|J|,a∈A=synJ+∗(xi1,…,xi|J|).We have seen that for option (γ+) any value functionUintcan be extended quite straightforward from a set of alternatives A to the Cartesian product of the scales of criteriaΠi=1nXistill keeping the monotoncity. Moreover, as we have already seen from the introductory example of this subsection, outside option (γ+) there is no certainty that there exists a monotonic extensionUint′ofUint. Thus, two questions obviously arise:•how to check if a preference relation ≿ on A can be represented by a value functionUintthat admits an extensionUint′toΠi=1nXi?how to construct an extensionUint′ofUinttoΠi=1nXi?The following result gives an answer to these two questions. Let us consider a value functionUint:A→RUint(a)=u1(g1(a))+…+u2(g2(a))+∑{i,i′}∈Synsyni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))-syni,i′-(gi(a),gi′(a)),∀a∈A,such that each criterion interacts with at most one other criterion and Syn is the set of couples{i,i′}⊆Iof interacting criteria. An extensionUint′:A′→RofUinttoA′,A⊆A′⊆Πi=1nXi, is a value functionUint′(x)=u1′(x1)+…+u2′(x2)+∑{i,i′}∈Synsyni,i′+′(xi,xi′)-syni,i′-′(xi,xi′),∀x∈Πi=1nXithat respects the monotonicity and, for alla∈A, satisfies condition (FV) plus the following condition:(FSPN)(Faithfulness of Synergy functions for Positive and Negative interactions)syni,i′+′(gi(a),gi′(a))=syni,i′+(gi(a),gi′(a))andsyni,i′-′(gi(a),gi′(a))=syni,i′-(gi(a),gi′(a))for all{i,i′}∈Syn,A preference relation ≿ on A can be represented by a value functionUintadmitting extensionsUint′to any setA′, whereA⊂A′⊆Πi=1nXi, if and only if there is an extensionUint′ofUinttoΠi=1n{gi(a):a∈A}.♢Let us illustrate the result of Proposition 4 using the example introduced at the beginning of this subsection. Suppose this time thatsyn1,2-(good,medium)=0.2.Then, we haveUint(a)=Uint(good,medium)=u1(good)+u2(medium)-syn1,2-(good,medium)=0.5+0.2-0.2=0.5.Observe that now we can extend the value functionUintfromA={a,b}={(good,medium),(medium,good)}toA′={g1(a),g1(b)}×{g2(a),g2(b)}={(medium,medium),(medium,good),(good,medium),(good,good)}by means of value functionUint′defined asUint′(x)=u1′(x1)+u2′(x2)-syn1,2-′(x1,x2),whereu1′(medium)=u2′(medium)=0.2,u1′(good)=u2′(good)=0.5,syn1,2-′(good,medium)=syn1,2-′(medium,medium)=0.2,syn1,2-′(medium,good)=syn1,2-′(good,good)=0.4.Indeed, in this case we haveUint′(medium,medium)=0.2+0.2-0.2=0.2,Uint′(good,good)=0.5+0.5-0.4=0.6,so that, together withUint′(good,medium)=0.5andUint′(medium,good)=0.2, we getUint′(medium,medium)<Uint′(good,medium)<Uint′(medium,good)<Uint′(medium,good),and, consequently, the monotonicity is satisfied. By Proposition 4, the extensionUint′ofUinttoA′ensures that there exits also at least one extensionUint″toX=Πi=1nXi, i.e., in our example, the extensionUint′toA′={medium,good}×{medium,good}ensures the existence of an extensionUint″toA″={bad,medium,good,verygood}×{bad,medium,good,verygood}.One can get an extensionUint″, taking the following values for the marginal value functionsu1″andu2″,u1″(bad)=u2″(bad)=0,u1″(medium)=u2″(medium)=0.2,u1″(good)=u2″(good)=0.5,u1″(verygood)=u2″(verygood)=0.7,and the values shown in Table 5for the synergy functionsyn1,2-″.Value functionUint″gives values shown in Table 6to all the pairs(x1,x2)from the product spaceA″.Proposition 4 suggests that, working with option (α), (β) or (γ−), in order to obtain a value functionUintthat admits an extension to the whole Cartesian productX=Πi=1nXi, it is necessary to modify the sets constraintsEUint≿,α,EUint≿,βorEUint≿,γ-, by introducing variables related to synergy functionssyni1,i2+(x1,x2)andsyni1,i2-(x1,x2)to all(x1,x2)∈{gi1(a):a∈A}×{gi2(a):a∈A},{i1,i2}⊆I}, and not only tosyni1,i2+(g1(a),g2(a))andsyni1,i2-(g1(a),g2(a))fora∈A. Of course, this modification also concerns the related monotonicity constraints. E.g., in case of option (α), condition (29) inEUint≿,αhas to be rewritten as follows:syni1,i2+(xi1,xi2)⩾syni1,i2+(yi1,yi2),{i1,i2}⊆I,forall(xi1,xi2),(yi1,yi2)∈{gi1(a):a∈A}×{gi2(a):a∈A},ifxi1⩾yi1andxi2⩾yi2.One has to rewrite analogously conditions (30)–(32), while condition (33) has to be reformulated as follows:ui1(xi1)+ui2(xi2)+syni1,i2+(xi1,xi2)-syni1,i2-(xi1,xi2)⩾ui1(yi1)+ui2(yi2)+syni1,i2+(yi1,yi2)-syni1,i2-(yi1,yi2),{i1,i2}⊆I,forall(xi1,xi2),(yi1,yi2)∈{gi1(a):a∈A}×{gi2(a):a∈A},ifxi1⩾yi1andxi2⩾yi2.Observe, moreover, that option (γ+) can be considered as a particular case of options (α) or (β), and therefore, before introducing new variables and before reformulating the monotonicity conditions, as explained before, it is recommended to verify if the preference relation ≿ on A, and, more in general, the preference information supplied by the DM, can be represented using option (γ+) which, by Proposition 3, ensures the existence of an extension to the product space without any further condition. Only when this is not possible, one should pass to apply Proposition 4.In option (α), value function (20) takes into account all possible positive and negative interactions between pairs of criteria. Analogously, in option (β) only one ofsyni1,i2+andsyni1,i2-is considered for all{i1,i2}⊆I. Finally, in option (γ), allsyni1,i2+or allsyni1,i2-,{i1,i2}⊆I, are considered in value function (46) or (47), respectively. In all these options, however, it is desirable to have a compatible value function with as small number of interactions as possible. In the following, we show how to infer, from the DM’s preference information, a value function (20) for option (α) and (β) and a compatible value function (46) or (47) for option (γ), involving minimal (in the sense of inclusion) sets of couples{i1,i2}⊆Iof interacting criteria. Observe that there can be more than one of such minimal sets, and their intersection is very interesting because, if not empty, it contains couples of interacting criteria that cannot be removed from representation of the DM’s preference information. From this point of view, the minimal sets of interacting couples and their intersections resemble the concepts of reducts and core, respectively, in rough set theory (Pawlak, 1991). In options (α) and (γ) we shall consider variablesγi1,i2, while in option (β) we shall use variablesδi1i2+andδi1i2-,{i1,i2}⊆I, defined above. Observe, moreover, that in all three options, the minimal set of couples{i1,i2}⊆Iof interacting criteria depends on the values ofρandεin sets of constraintsEUint≿,α,EUint≿,β,EUint≿,γ-andEUint≿,γ+.In option (α), in order to find a value functionUαintinvolving a minimal set of couples of interacting criteria{i1,i2}⊆I, one has to minimizeν(ε‾,ρ‾)α=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iγi1,i2, subject to constraintsEUint≿,α, withε=ε‾andρ=ρ‾such that isEUint≿,αis feasible. Of course, the couples of criteria for which there is an interaction will be those couples{i1,i2}⊆Ifor whichγi1,i2=1. Analogously, for option (β), we have to minimizeν(ε‾,ρ‾)β=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iδi1,i2-+δi1,i2+, subject to constraintsEUint≿,β, withε=ε‾andρ=ρ‾such thatEUint≿,βis feasible. A couple of criteria{i1,i2}⊆Iinteracts ifδi1,i2-+δi1,i2+=1, with only negative synergy whenδi1,i2-=1and only positive synergy whenδi1,i2+=1. For option (γ) with positive synergies only, in order to find a compatible value functionUγ+int(46) involving a minimal set of couples of positively interacting criteria{i1,i2}⊆I, one has to minimizeν(ε‾,ρ‾)γ+=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iγi1,i2, subject to constraintsEUint≿,γ+, withε=ε‾andρ=ρ‾such thatEUint≿,γ+is feasible. The couples of criteria for which there is a positive interaction will be those couples{i1,i2}⊆Ifor whichγi1,i2=1. Finally, for option (γ) with negative synergies only, in order to find a value functionUγ-int(47) involving a minimal set of couples of negatively interacting criteria{i1,i2}⊆I, one has to minimizeν(ε‾,ρ‾)γ-=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iγi1,i2, subject to constraintsEUint≿,γ-, withε=ε‾andρ=ρ‾such thatEUint≿,γ-is feasible. The couples of criteria for which there is a negative interaction will be those couples{i1,i2}⊆Ifor whichγi1,i2=1.In all the three options (α), (β) and (γ), other minimal sets of interacting couples of criteria can be found by forbidding the minimal sets already determined, denoted bySyn1,…,Synh⊆I[2], withI[2]={{i1,i2}⊆I}for option (α) and (γ), and by(Syn1-,Syn1+),…,(Synh-,Synh+)⊆I, withI={(S1,S2):S1,S2∈I[2],S1∩S2=∅}for option (β). For option (α), we consider the sets of constraintsEUint≿,α,h, whereEUint≿,α,his obtained fromEUint≿,αby adding the constraint(49)∑{i1,i2}∈Syneγi1,i2⩽|Syne|-1,e=1,…,h.IfEUint≿,α,his feasible, a new minimal set can be determined by minimizingν(ε‾,ρ‾)α=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iγi1,i2, subject to constraintsEUint≿,α,h. IfEUint≿,α,his not feasible, thenSynα={Syn1,…,Synh}is the family of all minimal subsets of couples of interacting criteria.For option (β), we consider the sets of constraintsEUint≿,β,hwhereEUint≿,β,his obtained fromEUint≿,βby adding the constraint(50)∑{i1,i2}∈Syne+δi1,i2++∑{i1,i2}∈Syne-δi1,i2-⩽|Syne-∪Syne+|-1,e=1,…,h.Analogously to option (α), ifEUint≿,β,his feasible, a new minimal set can be determined by minimizingν(ε‾,ρ‾)β=∑{i1,i2}⊆Iδi1,i2++δi1,i2+, subject to constraintsEUint≿,β,h. IfEUint≿,β,his not feasible, thenSynβ={(Syn1+,Syn1-)…,(Synh+,Synh-)}is the family of all minimal pairs(Syne+,Syne-)of subsets of couples of positively and negatively interacting criteria.For option (γ), analogously to option (α), constraints (49) are added to set of constraintsEUint≿,γ+andEUint≿,γ-, obtaining sets of constraintsEUint≿,γ+,handEUint≿,γ-,hin case of positive and negative synergies only, respectively. At the end of the procedure we get the family of all minimal subsets of couples of interacting criteriaSynγ+when only bonuses are considered, andSynγ-when only penalties are considered.Depending on the type of preference representation selected, i.e., options (α), (β) or (γ) with positive or negative synergies only, the family of minimal sets of couples of interacting criteriaSynα,Synβ,Synγ+orSynγ-are presented to the DM for selection of a single set of couples of interacting criteria which will be used in the next step. The DM is free to modify the selected set, by adding or removing some couples of interacting criteria{i1,i2}⊆I. In case some couples of interacting criteria are removed it is necessary to verify if the DM’s preference information is still representable using value functionUint. Once the set of couples of interacting criteria is fixed, for options (α) and (γ) one continues the decision aiding process using the value functionUintwith the binary variablesγi1,i2related to couples{i1,i2}∈Iof interacting criteria fixed to 1, and the binary variablesγi1,i2related to couples{i1,i2}∈Iof non-interacting criteria fixed to 0. For option (α), if the set of considered couples of interacting criteria isSynα={{i1,1,i1,2},…,{ir,1,ir,2}},then, puttingγi1,i2=1for{i1,i2}∈Synαandγi1,i2=0for{i1,i2}∉Synα, the value functionUintbecomes(51)Uα,Synαint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}⊆Synαsyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a)),a∈A.Moreover, the set of constraints to be considered becomesEUint≿,α,Synα, obtained from constraintsEUint≿,α,•taking into account value functionUα,Synαint(51),considering constraints (29)–(35) with respect to{i1,i2}⊆Synαinstead of{i1,i2}⊆I,rewriting constraints (36) and (37) as follows:(52)syni1,i2+(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρ,forall{i1,i2}⊆Synα,(53)syni1,i2-(xi1∗,xi2∗)⩽ρ,forall{i1,i2}⊆Synα,removing constraints (38) and (39) because they are no more necessary.For option (γ) the set of constraints to be considered is analogous.For option (β), once the set of couples of interacting criteria is fixed, one continues the decision aiding process using the value functionUintwith the binary variablesδi1,i2+andδi1,i2-related to couples{i1,i2}∈Iof non-interacting criteria fixed to 0, while the constraints (41)δi1i2++δi1i2-⩽1,about the binary variablesδi1,i2+andδi1,i2-related to couples{i1,i2}∈Iof interacting criteria, are maintained. Observe, thus that both for option (α) and for option (γ), once the set of couples of interacting criteria is fixed, the decision aiding process continues with a set of constraints where there are no more binary variables, while this is not the case for option (β), for which it is necessary to continue to take into account some binary variables. Thus for option (β), if the set of considered couples of interacting criteria isSynβ={{i1,1,i1,2},…,{ir,1,ir,2}},then, puttingδi1,i2+=0andδi1,i2-=0for{i1,i2}∉Synβ, the value functionUintbecomes(54)Uβ,Synβint(a)=∑i=1nui(gi(a))+∑{i1,i2}⊆Synβsyni1,i2+(gi1(a),gi2(a))-syni1,i2-(gi1(a),gi2(a)),a∈Aunder constraints (41)–(43) related only to pairs{i1,i2}⊆Synβ, to ensure the mutual exclusion between positive and negative synergies on the same couple of criteria.Therefore, the set of constraints to be considered becomesEUint≿,β,Synβ, obtained from constraintsEUint≿,β,•taking into account value functionUβ,Synβint(54),considering constraints (29)–(35) and constraints (41)–(43) and (45) with respect to{i1,i2}⊆Synβinstead of{i1,i2}⊆I,removing constraints (44) because they are no more necessary.Note that, when considering the Choquet integral, one can also identify a capacity compatible with a set of pairwise comparisons provided by the DM in result of solving an optimization problem (Grabisch, Kojadinovic, & Meyer, 2008; Marichal & Roubens, 2000; Mayag, Grabisch, & Labreuche, 2008), or even one can consider the whole set of capacities compatible with the DM’s preference information (Angilella et al., 2010). It should be observed, however that such capacity identification requires that all marginal value functions involved in the Choquet integral are known beforehand (in order to make all criteria scales commensurable). A methodology permitting to build the scales and a capacity for the Choquet integral has been proposed in Angilella et al. (2004), however, it is just a heuristic, not an exact algorithm. Remark that in our approach, the structure of interaction between criteria is identified together with the set of compatible value functions, taking into account the original performances of alternatives.Let us conclude this section with an observation that it may be difficult for some DMs to select one of the minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria. In such a case, one could either select by default a minimal set of couples with the least number of couples, or decide to use one-by-one all minimal sets of couples for calculation of the corresponding possible and necessary preference relations, and then aggregate these results to the following conclusions inspired by considerations known from application of ROR in the context of group decisions (Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2012):(a)necessary-necessary preference≿NN, if a is necessarily preferred to b for all the minimal sets,possible-necessary preference≿PN, if a is necessarily preferred to b for at least one minimal set,necessary-possible preference≿NP, if a is only possibly preferred to b for all the minimal sets,possible-possible preference≿PP, if a is only possibly preferred to b for at least one minimal set.We shall explain how to compute necessary and possible preference relations ≿Nand ≿Pfor all pairs of alternativesa,b∈Afor the three above options (α), (β) and (γ) in case only positive or only negative synergies are considered using setsU≿,αint,U≿,βint,U≿,γ+intandU≿,γ-intof all value functions with interacting criteria, compatible with the DM’s preference information. Indeed this is analogous to what is done in case there is no interaction between criteria as explained in above Section 4.3. The difference is that in the linear programming problem to be solved we must take into consideration the constraintsEUint≿,α,Synα,EUint≿,β,Synβ,EUint≿,γ+,Synγ+,EUint≿,γ-,Synγ-related to the selected options (α), (β) and (γ) in case only positive or only negative synergies are considered, respectively. Consequently, for a given pair of alternativesa,b∈A, the necessary preference relationa≿Nbholds in the three options iff the following linear programN(a,b)is not feasible orεN★≤0, whereεN★denotes a maximal value of the objectiveεinN(a,b):(55)Maximize:εsubjecttoUint(b)⩾Uint(a)+ε,constraintsEUint≿,#,Syn#,whereEUint≿,#,Syn#is equal toEUint≿,α,Synα,EUint≿,β,Synβ,EUint≿,γ+,Synγ+,EUint≿,γ-,Synγ-,andUintis equal toUα,Synαint,Uβ,Synβint,Uγ+,Synγ+int,Uγ-,Synγ-intaccording to the considered options.For a given pair of alternativesa,b∈A, the possible preference relationa≿Pbholds in the same options considered for the necessary preference ≿Niff the linear programming problemP(a,b), obtained from problemN(a,b)replacing the first constraint byUint(a)⩾Uint(b), is feasible andεP★>0, whereεP★denotes the maximal value of the objectiveεinP(a,b).Moreover, for given pairs of alternatives(a,b),(c,d)∈A×A, the necessary preference intensity relation(a,b)≿∗N(c,d)holds iffN(a,b,c,d)is not feasible orεˆN★≤0, whereN(a,b,c,d)is the linear programming problem analogical toN(a,b)in which the first constraint ofN(a,b)is replaced byUint(c)-Uint(d)⩾Uint(a)-Uint(b)+ε, andεˆN★denotes the maximal value of the objectiveεinN(a,b,c,d). Analogically again, in order to check if(a,b)≿∗P(c,d), we have to consider a new problemP(a,b,c,d)which is obtained from problemN(a,b)after replacing the first constraint byUint(a)-Uint(b)⩾Uint(c)-Uint(d).(a,b)≿∗P(c,d)holds ifP(a,b,c,d)is feasible andεˆP★>0, whereεˆP★denotes the maximal value of the objectiveεinP(a,b,c,d).Until now we have considered value functionsUintwithout any constraint on the existence of extensions to the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi, as discussed in subSection 5.3. According to Proposition 3, in case of option (γ+), all value functionsUintcompatible with the preference information supplied by the DM admit extensions to the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi, and, consequently, there is nothing to add in this case. Instead, when working with option (α), (β) or (γ−), if one wants to consider the necessary and the possible preferences relations ≿Nand ≿Pdetermined by value functionsUintwhich admit extensions to the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi, one has to reformulate the constraintsEUint≿,α,Synα,EUint≿,β,SynβandEUint≿,γ-,Synγ-according to Proposition 4. Denoting byU≿,α,eint,U≿,β,eintandrU≿,γ-,eintthe set of compatible value functions that in case of option (α), (β) or (γ−), respectively, admit extensions to the Cartesian product space, we obviously getU≿,α,eint⊆U≿,αint,U≿,β,eint⊆U≿,βint,U≿,γ-,eint⊆U≿,γ-int,i.e., the set of compatible value functions admitting an extension is a subset (proper or not) of the set of compatible value functionsUint. Observe that in order to determine the possible and the necessary preference relations resulting from application ofU≿,α,eint,U≿,β,eintandU≿,γ-,eint, it is necessary to deal with more variables and more constraints in the optimization problems. In some cases, however, one can avoid solving the augmented optimization problem while being certain that the necessary and the possible preference relations ≿Nand ≿Pdetermined by the set of compatible value functions observing monotonocity onUintare the same as if they were determined by the set of compatible value functions admitting an extension to the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi. This is possible taking into consideration the corollary of the following result, where we denote by≿UNand≿UPthe necessary and possible preference relations established by a set of value functionsU.Proposition 5≿U≿,αintN⊆≿U≿,α,eintN⊆≿U≿,γ+intN,≿U≿,βintN⊆≿U≿,β,eintN⊆≿U≿,γ+intN,≿U≿,αintP⊇≿U≿,α,eintP⊇≿U≿,γ+intP,≿U≿,βintP⊇≿U≿,β,eintP⊇≿U≿,γ+intP.♢A straightforward consequence of Proposition 5 is the following corollary.≿U≿,αintN=≿U≿,γ+intN⇒≿U≿,α,eintN=≿U≿,αintN=≿U≿,γ+intN,≿U≿,βintN=≿U≿,γ+intN⇒≿U≿,β,eintN=≿U≿,βintN=≿U≿,γ+intN,≿U≿,αintP=≿U≿,γ+intP⇒≿U≿,α,eintP=≿U≿,αintP=≿U≿,γ+intP,≿U≿,βintP=≿U≿,γ+intP⇒≿U≿,β,eintP=≿U≿,βintP=≿U≿,γ+intP.♢The robust ordinal regression builds a set of additive value functionsUA′intcompatible with preference information provided by the DM and results in necessary and possible preference relations. Such preference relations answer to robustness concerns, since they are in general “more robust” than a preference relation corresponding to a single compatible value functionUint∈UA′int. However, in real-world decision-making situations, a score is sometimes needed to assign to the different alternatives, and despite the interest of the preference relations provided, some users would like to see, and they indeed need to know, a “representative” value function among all the compatible ones. This allows assigning a score to each alternative.Recently, a methodology to identify a “representative” value function in UTAGMSand GRIP, without loosing the advantage of taking into account all compatible value functions, has been proposed in Figueira et al. (2008) and Greco, Kadziński, and Słowiński (2011). The idea is to select among compatible value functions a value function which maximizes the differencesU(a)-U(b)between such alternativesa,b∈Athata≻Nb, i.e., between alternatives for whicha≿Nband notb≿Na. As secondary objective, one can consider minimizing the difference of values between alternativesa,b∈A, for which the possible weak preference relation is symmetric, i.e.,a∼Pb. Finding such a “representative” value function boils down to solving two linear programming problems: first, maximize the difference in value of pairs in the≻Nrelation, and second, tend to equalize in value (within the margin left by solution of the first program) the pairs of alternatives in the∼Prelation.Notice that the concept of a “representative” value function thus defined is still based on the necessary and possible preference relations, which remain crucial for robust ordinal regression, and, in a sense, it gives the most faithful representation of this necessary and possible preference relations.The dean of a school has to rank some students that are evaluated on Mathematics, Physics and Literature, as shown in Table 7.The dean gives the following preference information:•preference information with respect to overall comparisons of students:–studentS2is better than studentS1,studentS3is better than studentS4,studentS5is better than studentS1,preference information relative to intensity of preference in overall comparison of students:–studentS3is preferred to studentS4more than studentS2is preferred to studentS1,preference information relative to intensity of preference with respect to scores on a subject:–in case of Mathematics and Literature, score Medium is preferred to score Bad more than score Good is preferred to score Medium,in case of Physics, score Good is preferred to score Medium more than score Medium is preferred to score Bad.Remark that in the absence of any preference information, the necessary preference relation in the set of students corresponds to the dominance relation represented by continuous arrows in Fig. 1. Moreover, in Fig. 1, the pairwise comparisons of students provided by the dean are represented by dashed arrows. Observe also that the above preference information concerns the set of reference studentsA′={S1,S2,S3,S4,S5}.In order to build a preference model as simple as possible, one has to check first if the given preference information can be represented by an additive value function and, in case this is not possible, one has to decide which option of preference representation with interactions, among (α), (β) and (γ), will be selected. For any option, one is also interested in finding the minimal sets of pairs of interacting criteria, as well as the sign of the corresponding interactions in case of option (β), permitting representation of dean’s preferences. In fact, these preferences cannot be represented by an additive value function, as can be easily verified observing that the preference of studentS2over studentS1and the preference of studentS3over studentS4violate the preference independence. In any case, this can be systematically checked using the procedure presented in Section 5.1. Let us illustrate this procedure on our example with options (α), (β) and (γ).Taking into account option (α), we computeεα=maxε, s.t.EUint≿,αwithρfixed equal to 1, and we findεα=0.33, and therefore there is some value function compatible with the dean’s preferences. In order to discover minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, we compute the minimum of∑{i1,i2}⊆Iγi1,i2, s.t.EUint≿,αwithεandρfixed equal to 0.001 and 1, respectively. We obtain at the optimum allγi1,i2variables equal to zero, exceptγmath,physequal to one. This means that, taking into account option (α), there exist value functionsUintcompatible with the dean’s preferences, involving a single couple of interacting criteria being Mathematics and Physics. In order to check if there exist other minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, we imposeγmath,phys=0and we run again the same program. This time we find that at the optimum allγi1,i2variables are equal to zero, exceptγmath,litequal to one, which means that, under option (α), there exist value functionsUintcompatible with the dean’s preferences, involving a single couple of interacting criteria being Mathematics and Literature. We impose alsoγmath,lit=0and we run again the same program, but this time the set of constraints is unfeasible. Thus, we stop the procedure, concluding that there are two alternative minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, which are the following:•the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Physics,the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature.These two possibilities are presented to the dean. He chooses the first minimal set of couples of interacting criteria, as the interaction between Mathematics and Physics fits best his intuition.We then compute the necessary and possible preference relations ≿Nand ≿Pon the set of all students using programNint(a,b)defined in Section 5.5, for each pair of students (Si,Sj). The results are presented in Tables 8 and 9.The Hasse diagram of the partial order corresponding to the necessary preference relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2(for the sake of simplicity we omitted loops in each node). It includes the dominance relation and the preference statements of the dean (see Fig. 1). To make the possible preference relation ≿Pmore readable for the dean, we present him in Fig. 3the Hasse diagram of≻P, which is the asymmetric part of ≿P.In order to give a score to each student, we computed a representative value function according to the procedure described in Section 5.6. This representative value function is presented in Tables 10–12. Table 10 defines the non-interacting part of the representative value functionUint, and Tables 11 and 12 define the “bonus” functionsynmath,phys+and the “penalty” functionsynmath,phys-, respectively. This representative value function assigns scores to students, as given in Table 13. Remark that this function permits to rank students that are not comparable using the necessary preference relation, and thus, according to the representative value function,S6is preferred toS2andS7, which, in turn, are indifferent between them and withS5.Taking into account option (β), again there exist value functions representing the deans’s preferences and we obtain the following minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria:•the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Physics interacting positively,the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature interacting positively,the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Physics interacting negatively,the minimal set composed of the couple Mathematics and Literature interacting negatively.Considering the couple composed of Mathematics and Physics, both in case of positive interaction and in case of negative interaction, we get the same necessary and possible preference relations as for option (α). The representative value function assigns the same scores both in case Mathematics and Physics interact positively and negatively. These scores are different from those given by the representative value function for option (α), however the students are ranked in the same way.Observe that the difference between option (β) and option (γ) is that under option (β) one can have couples of criteria for which there is a positive interaction and couples of criteria for which there is a negative interaction, while under option (γ) one can have positive interactions only or negative interactions only. Notice also that, as the considered decision problem have only three criteria, we can have only one couple of interacting criteria, because, on the contrary, we would have some criterion interacting with more than another one, and this would violate the assumption that each criterion can interact with at most one other criterion. Therefore, since the couple of interacting criteria can originate a bonus or a penalty, we have to conclude that option (β) and option (γ) are equivalent and, consequently, give the same minimal sets of couples of interacting criteria, the same necessary and possible preference relations and the same representative value functions in case the couple composed of Mathematics and Physics, both in case of positive interaction and in case of negative interaction, is selected.Until now we have considered all compatible value functionsUintensuring the monotonicity on A. If, however, one would like to consider compatible value functionsUintadmitting extensions to the Cartesian product spaceX=Πi=1nXi, then the necessary and the possible preference relations would be the same by Proposition 5 and its Corollary 5.1. Indeed, the necessary and the possible preference relations determined by all compatible value functions obtained for option (α) or (β) are the same as those determined by all compatible value functionsUintobtained for option (γ) (which in fact is option (γ+) because we are considering a positive synergy between Mathematics and Physics).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented a robust ordinal regression method,UTAGMS-INT, able to handle positive and negative interactions between criteria. The methodology is based on an additive value function preference model which includes “bonus” and “penalty” components corresponding to positively and negatively interacting pairs of criteria, respectively.TheUTAGMS-INTpreference model compares favorably to the Choquet integral which is frequently used to handle interacting sets of criteria. It does not require all criteria to be defined on a common numerical scale, and its interpretation is more intuitive. Although in the present paper, we restrict to interactions concerning pairs of criteria (which is a reasonable hypothesis in practice), theUTAGMS-INTmethodology can easily be extended to handle interaction between more than two criteria.Moreover, the proposed methodology allows the DM to discover the pairs of interacting criteria and the compatible value functions from preference statements, whereas the existing literature supposes an a priori knowledge of either the interactions (e.g., Gonzales & Perny, 2005), or the marginal value functions (e.g., Grabisch et al., 2008). It should be emphasized thatUTAGMS-INTuses interaction in a parsimonious way, i.e., computes a preference model involving a minimum number of interacting pairs of criteria. In particular, when the DM’s preference statements can be represented by a simple additive value function, then no interaction is considered.Once the pairs of interacting criteria have been identified, a standard robust ordinal regression is performed to compute necessary and possible preference relations, as well as a representative value function. All this procedure is intended to be used iteratively, thus supporting the construction of a final recommendation.In future work, it will be important to assess the practical usefulness of the methodology through experiments on some simulated data. For instance, an interesting issue would be to check the relation between the amount and quality of preference information provided by the DM and the need for representation of interaction.The newly proposed preference model involving interactions can be used in a straightforward way in robust ordinal regression for sorting problems (Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2010), group decision (Greco et al., 2012), extreme ranking analysis (Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012), and in case of hierarchical structure of the family of criteria (Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012). It has already been used in Angilella, Corrente, Greco, and Słowiński (2014) to successfully extend the multicriteria customer satisfaction method MUSA (Grigoroudis & Siskos, 2002). It is enriching the toolbox of multiple-criteria decision aiding methods for which the questions guiding the choice of the most appropriate methods proposed in Roy and Słowiński (2013) remain valid.
