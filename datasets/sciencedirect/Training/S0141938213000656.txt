@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The characteristics of MoO3/F8BT/ZnO inorganic/organic hybrid light emitting diodes (IO-HyLEDs) fabricated on ZnO/Ag/ZnO dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) and conventional ZnO/ITO were investigated. The DMD had a low sheet resistance of 9Ω/sq and a high transmittance of 90.7%. The device fabricated on DMD showed similar current density–voltage (J–V) and luminance–current density (L–J) characteristics to that on ZnO/ITO, indicating the possibility of DMD as a promising transparent conductive layer for IO-HyLEDs. The maximum luminous intensity of 237,000cd/m2 was demonstrated under pulsed condition for the DMD device. We also investigated the effect of the combination interlayer (CIL) at the F8BT/ZnO interface on the IO-HyLEDs. The CIL was composed of a Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O bilayer and a self-assembled dipole molecule (SADM) of BA-CH3. The devices with CIL exhibited an approximately threefold enhancement of the luminous intensity and efficiency in comparison with the devices without CIL. This improvement was considered to be brought about by the enhancement of the electron injection efficiency by CIL.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Light emitting devices in the visible range, such as inorganic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) composed of III–V compound semiconductors such as AlGaInN [1] and AlGaInP [2] and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been realized and are spreading as an alternative to light bulbs and fluorescent lamps. Inorganic semiconductors have excellent electrical conductivity, band engineering ability, environmental resistance and high thermal conductivity. Furthermore, blue and red (InGaN- or InGaP-based) LEDs have been realized to possess extremely high external quantum efficiency. However, the luminous efficiency from the green to yellow range is significantly low, so called “Green Gap Problem” [3], and inorganic LEDs are difficult to apply as a large area and flexible light source. On the other hand, organic semiconductors show excellent luminous efficiency despite their simple deposition process, such as vacuum evaporation or spin coating, and are suitable as a large area and flexible light source. However, organic semiconductors have disadvantages such as low electrical and thermal conductivities and low environmental resistance to moisture and oxygen. A progressive improvement of device performance can be expected by utilizing the advantages of both inorganic and organic semiconductors synergistically and also by compensating for each disadvantage. We call these attractive devices inorganic/organic hybrid LEDs (IO-HyLEDs).In preliminary studies of IO-HyLEDs, the structure of MoO3/F8BT (poly(9,9-dioctyl fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole))/TiO2[4], MoO3/F8BT/ZnO [5], MoO3/F8BT/MgO [6], MoO3/F8BT/HfO2[6], ZnO/α-NPD(N,N′-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine) [7], α-NPD/n-GaN [8], Alq3 (Tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum)/p-GaN [9] has been reported. In many IO-HyLEDs, disproportionate charge injection balance as a consequence of low electron injection efficiency from the inorganic to the organic layer has been a serious problem, which limits the device performance. It is expected that if efficient charge transport and blocking technique, which improve the charge injection balance in the organic emission layer, are established, the device performance will improve markedly. In a typical IO-HyLED structure of MoO3/F8BT/ZnO, the conduction band of ZnO is lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) of F8BT; thereby, the electron injection barrier is formed at the interface. Until now, some studies on decreasing the barrier to increase the electron injection efficiency yielding improvement of the device performance by inserting a self-assembled dipole molecule (SADM) [10], Cs2CO3[11], or conjugated polyelectrolyte [12] have been reported. We have also reported the effect of the MgZnO layer and SADM in the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO IO-HyLEDs [13,14], and the AlGaN layer and SADM in the MoO3/F8BT/GaN IO-HyLEDs [15,16].Although ITO has been widely utilized as a transparent conductive layer (TCL) for organic devices, the search for alternative transparent conductive materials is being intensely pursued because ITO has some serious problems such as resource depletion of In, degradation of device performance by In diffusion, low flexibility of ITO film and necessity of high-temperature process for low resistance. Metal thin films have excellent electrical conductivity owing to their high electron density; however, metal has high reflectance from visible light to infrared. By sandwiching the metal layer by dielectric films with appropriate thickness, it is possible to impart a high transmission for visible light owing to the effect of optical interference and reflecting infrared light or electromagnetic waves. This dielectric/metal/dielectric technique is called DMD and has been utilized in low-E glass [17]. The DMD film has a high electrical conductivity and an excellent transmittance in the visible range comparable to those of ITO; therefore, recently, there have been some reports on the utilization of the DMD film as a TCL of opto-electronic devices [18–23].In this report, we introduce the DMD film consisting of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Ag into the IO-HyLED. The characteristics of devices using DMD and ZnO/ITO are investigated. We also investigated the effect of Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O step-like bilayer electron injection layer (EIL) to improve the electron injection efficiency of the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO IO-HyLED. Furthermore, we examined the synergistic effect by combining BA-CH3 (4-methyl benzoic acid) as SADM and the inorganic bilayer EIL.Fig. 1shows a typical schematic of the IO-HyLED used in this study. ZnO/Ag/ZnO DMD films were deposited on SiO2 substrates by ion beam sputtering (IBS) at room temperature. The ZnO layers were doped with Al by co-sputtering technique of ZnO and Al metal targets. Then, 10-nm-thick MgxZn1−xO (x=0.25, 0.52) layers were deposited on the DMD film by IBS with co-sputtering using ZnO and MgO targets. The MgZnO layers ware also doped with Al under the same condition as the Al-doped ZnO layers. After 10min of UV–ozone cleaning, a BA-CH3 layer was formed by spin-coating using an ethanol solution as a SADM layer; then, the sample was annealed for 3min at 100°C in air. Following these processes, an F8BT layer was formed by spin-coating using toluene solution (20mg/mL) as the green light-emitting polymer in air. An inorganic hole injection layer of MoO3 (20nm) and Au (70nm) were formed in circular p-electrode patterns with a 500μm diameter by resistance heating vacuum evaporation. Indium was used as an n-type electrode. For comparison, we also fabricated the IO-HyLED based on ZnO/ITO/glass, without a MgZnO layer and an SADM layer, and then compared their emission characteristics. The ZnO layer of the ZnO/ITO device was deposited by IBS in the same manner as mentioned above on a commercially available ITO-coated glass. The device characterization was carried out immediately after fabrication in air. The current density–voltage (J–V) and current density–luminance (L–J) characteristics of the IO-HyLED were measured simultaneously using a TOPCON BM-5A and a source measure unit GS-610 (YOKOGAWA Electric Corp.). The light output was measured through the DMD or ITO layer from the substrate side.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We investigated the effects of the TCL and the EIL on the device characteristics of the IO-HyLED with the MoO3/F8BT/ZnO system utilizing a ZnO/Ag/ZnO-DMD transparent conductive film, a MgZnO electron injection bilayer and SADM. The IO-HyLED fabricated on the DMD film showed performance similar to that of the IO-HyLED fabricated on ZnO/ITO. The DMD-based device showed a relatively high luminous intensity of 237,000cd/m2 under the pulsed driving condition. It was showed that ZnO/Ag/ZnO-DMD is a promising TCL for IO-HyLEDs. The effects of EILs composed of Mg0.25Zn0.75O, Mg0.52Zn0.48O and BA-CH3 on the emission characteristics of the devices were examined. Systematic improvements of the luminous intensity of devices by various EIL structures were observed. In the device with an 85-nm-thick F8BT, the luminous efficiency of 0.44cd/A for the device without the EIL was improved about threefold to 1.42cd/A by the synergistic effect of the CIL of the Mg0.52Zn0.48O/Mg0.25Zn0.75O bilayer and SADM (BA-CH3).The study of IO-HyLEDs is still in the early stage. It is expected that the development of a suitable combination of inorganic and organic semiconductors and device structures will bring about the superior device performance exceeding those of inorganic LEDs or OLEDs.
