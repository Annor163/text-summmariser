@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Protein p7 of HCV is a 63 amino acid channel forming membrane protein essential for the progression of viral infection. With this momentousness, p7 emerges as an important target for antiviral therapy. A series of small molecule drugs, such as amantadine, rimantadine, amiloride, hexamethylene amiloride, NN-DNJ and BIT225 have been found to affect the channel activity. These compounds are docked against monomeric and hexameric structures of p7 taken at various time steps from a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein embedded in a hydrated lipid bilayer. The energetics of binding identifies the guanidine based ligands as the most potent ligands. The adamantanes and NN-DNJ show weaker binding energies. The lowest energy poses are those at the site of the loop region for the monomer and hexamer. For the latter, the poses show a tendency of the ligand to face the lumen of the pore. The mode of binding is that of a balance between hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation with backbone atoms of the protein.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Hepatitis C virus is a pathogen which infects liver cells and could lead to asymptomatic conditions in patients ((Poynard et al., 2003) and references therein). There is an evidence that exposure to HCV can be linked to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the infection is treated with interferon/ribavirin which is not well tolerated by many patients. There is a series of novel small molecule drugs in the pipeline to improve future therapy (Sharma, 2010; Tong et al., 2012). These drugs are developed to target soluble proteins. Promising small molecule drugs are on its way targeting a membrane protein encoded by HCV, namely p7, a channel forming protein (Pavlović et al., 2003; Luscombe et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2011).Viral channel forming proteins (VCPs) are found in a series of viruses (Fischer and Sansom, 2002; Gonzales and Carrasco, 2003; Wang et al., 2010; Nieva et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2012; OuYang and Chou, 2014). In some of the viruses, the VCP is non-essential for the survival of the virus, in others, however, including HCV, the VCP is essential. To date, known and applied antivirals targeting VCPs are amantadine and its derivative rimantadine (Hay et al., 1985) as well as guanidinium compounds (Luscombe et al., 2010), with other types of small molecules proposed (Foster et al., 2014).HCV protein p7 is a 63 amino acids polytopic membrane protein with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which belongs to the class of VCPs. It is produced at the site of the ER as part of a polyprotein (Lin et al., 1994). Upon cleavage, p7 is separated from preceding structural and successive non-structural proteins of HCV. Its role as a VCP has been established by in vitro channel recording experiments using synthetic peptides corresponding to p7 (Pavlović et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2004) or protein expressed in and purified from bacterial vectors (Griffin et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2006). The consequence of p7 activity is identified to support viral assembly (Gentzsch et al., 2013). Channel recordings show that p7 is a weak cation specific channel which can be modulated by Ca-ions (Premkumar et al., 2004). Recently, its capability to conduct protons has been reported (Wozniak et al., 2010). Channel activity is found due to the oligomerization of the protein. Hexameric assemblies for selected strains are identified to be the prevalent form of the oligomeric protein using EM (Griffin et al., 2003; Luik et al., 2009) and NMR spectroscopy (OuYang et al., 2013) although a genotype specific heptamer is reported (Clarke et al., 2006). Structural features range from the formation of more or less parallelly aligned helical segments (Foster et al., 2014; Patargias et al., 2006; Cook and Opella, 2010; Montserret et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2013) to a more complex intercalation of three helical segments (OuYang et al., 2013).Conductance measurements have shown that amantadine (Griffin et al., 2003), imino sugars like NN-DNJ (Pavlović et al., 2003; Pavlović et al., 2005) and guanidines such as hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) (Premkumar et al., 2004) and BIT225 (Luscombe et al., 2010) are potential candidates to block channel activity. The poses of the potential drugs have been investigated using NMR spectroscopy (Cook et al., 2013), biochemical methods (StGelais et al., 2009) and computational approaches on monomeric (Wang et al., 2013) as well as computational derived structural bundles models of p7 (Patargias et al., 2006; StGelais et al., 2009).In this study, the poses of most of the known ligands affecting VCPs are used to probe their interaction with monomeric and hexameric p7 of genotype 1a. Protein flexibility is taken into account by docking the ligands to various structures taken from MD simulations at different time steps. This protocol allows screening energetic and structural features of ligand–p7 interaction supporting the drug development process.The p7 protein sequence was taken from the HCV genotype 1a, H77 strain (Pavlović et al., 2003): ALENLVILNA10 ASLAGTHGLV20 SFLVFFCFAW30 YLKGRWVPGA40 VYAFYGMWPL50 LLLLLALPQR60 AYA.The following ligands have been used for docking: N-[5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-naphtalene-2-carbonyl]-guanidine (BIT225) (Luscombe et al., 2010), N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) (Durantel et al., 2001), 1-amino-adamantane (AMA) and α-methyl-1-adamantane methylamine (RIM) (Hay et al., 1985), N-amino-3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine carboxamide (AMIL) (Benos, 1982) and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride (HMA) (Ewart et al., 2002).The monomer and hexamer were taken from simulations reported earlier (Wang et al., 2013, 2014). In brief, each of the TMDs (TMD1–32, TMD236–63) was individually simulated in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer (POPC) for 50ns (Wang et al., 2013). Averaged structures over the backbone atoms of the 50ns MD simulations of each of the TMDs were derived by fitting the peptide structure of each time frame to the starting structure thereby removing rotational and translational motions. The program g_covar from the GROMACS-4.0.5 packages was used for the calculations. The monomer is formed by linking the assembled TMDs with a short loop (Lys-33, Gly-34, Arg-35) using the program Loopy (Xiang et al., 2002; Soto et al., 2008). The derived monomeric structure was embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. Hexameric bundles were generated with the monomer by creating symmetric copies of the monomeric subunit around a central pore axis (Krüger and Fischer, 2009; Hsu and Fischer, 2011). To sample the whole conformational space of the bundles each of the degrees of freedom were varied stepwise: (i) distance of the monomer to the central axis, (ii) rotational angle, and (iii) tilt. For each position, the side chains were linked to the backbone. The side chain conformation was chosen to be the most likely one for a given backbone conformation according to the MOE library. A short minimization (15 steps of steepest decent) followed the generation of the side chains. For each conformation, the potential energy was evaluated according to the all-atom AMBER94 force field mimicking a bilayer environment (ϵ=2). The lowest energy conformer was then embedded into a fully hydrated POPC lipid bilayer.Lipid bilayer patches were generated from 16:1-18:1 Diester PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glyucero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules on the basis of the parameters of Chandrasekhar et al. Chandrasekhar et al. (2003). The lipid patches were equilibrated for 50ns. MD simulations of the bundles/lipid/water system were carried out with GROMACS-4.5.4 using Gromos96 ffG45a3 force field. The p7 models were embedded into the POPC bilayer system and the overlapping lipid molecules were removed using the g_membed program from GROMACS-4.5.4.The extracted structures from MD simulations were individually imported in to LeadIT V.2.1.2 (www.bioslveit.com) and docked with several compounds. The software generates fragments of the ligand and places them onto the target (Rarey et al., 1996). The scoring function of this software is based on free energy estimation taking hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions and lipophilic contact surfaces into account (Böhm, 1992, 1994). The CORINA software was implemented generating potential conformers of cyclic and acyclic molecules (Sadowski et al., 1992). In the latter case, conformers of an aliphatic chain were generated along the ‘principle of longest pathway’ (Sadowski and Gasteiger, 1993). The ligands of the compounds were generated in MOE 2011.10 and imported in LeadIT in their respective protonated state. The guanidine moiety was protonated in LeadIT.The receptor files of the monomer structures were prepared by loading the extracted structures as protein files into LeadIT and defining the binding site as the whole protein by individual marking of all residues. The receptor files of the hexamer structures were also prepared by loading the extracted structures as protein files in to LeadIT and then separately defining four different binding sites or regions due to the great size of the hexamer structure. The loop region (LR) includes residues 25–45 of each monomer chain. The terminal region (TR) includes residues 1–13 and 50–63 of the N- and C-terminal sites. The pore region (PR) is covered by defining a sphere of a 20Å radius around Gly-18 (PR1), as well as around Thr-205 (PR2). The two amino acids were chosen as central points. The PR included screening of the membrane-exposed site of the TMDs.The docking was done using the default settings as following. Docking strategy: enthalpy and entropy (hybrid approach); scoring: scaling accessed, same settings to all H-bond relevant contact types; full score contribution: 0.3; no score contribution: 0.7; stereo mode: no stereo modes considered; protein–ligand maximum allowed overlap volume: 2.9Å3; intra-ligand clash-factor: 0.6, hydrogen atoms considered; maximum number of solutions per iteration: 200; maximum number of solutions per fragmentation: 200.The results were evaluated by tabulating the score values of the lowest energy pose of the compounds docked to the structures and using the 2D-docking-pose to tabulate the amino acids involved as well as their form of interaction. The average binding energies and standard deviation, as well as the average number of amino acids involved of all MD-simulation structures for each compound, were calculated for the monomer and the hexamer structure.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Amongst the ligands tested, the guanidinium based drugs are bound to the putative structures of the monomer and hexameric form of p7 protein at the site of the loop with a trend to face the lumen of the pore. The mode of binding should be driven by balancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation with backbone atoms of the protein.
