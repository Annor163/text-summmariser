@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study evaluates the effect of presentation media (PC tablet versus pencil and paper) on the performance, level of visual fatigue, and subjective preference of those taking visuospatial tests. Fifty university students participated and performed three visuospatial short-term memory tests and three visuospatial ability tests by using both types of display media. The display medium substantially affected all of the measured variables (p<0.01). On average, the paper–pencil test scores of the visuospatial short-term memory tests were about 10% higher and the answer time was about 20% shorter than those of the PC tablet tests. The average paper–pencil test score of the visuospatial ability tests was about 35% higher than the average test score of the PC tablet test. The visuospatial performance was substantially decreased under the PC tablet condition compared with that under the pencil–paper condition. In addition, visual fatigue was greater when participants used the PC tablet than when they used a pencil and paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The notebook computer is becoming increasingly prominent and, subsequently, the computer-based test is also being widely applied in various fields. The advantages of using computerized tests include immediate score reporting involving test-taker performance, as well as the reduction in costs related to printing, shipping, and administering paper and pencil tests [1]. Regarding the effect of the presentation mode on test performance, Mazzeo et al. [2] studied the contrast between paper–pencil and computer-based test scores in College-Level Examination Programs (CLEP). They found that the paper–pencil mathematics test scores were 1.74% higher and the English test scores were 3.66% higher than those of the computer-based tests. The disparity in test scores was substantial and was possibly caused by a lack of familiarity and experience in using the computer-based test method. In 2003, Choi et al. [3] reported that when participants took English language tests containing grammar, vocabulary, listening comprehension, and reading comprehension material, the reading comprehension scores of those who took the paper–pencil test were higher than the scores of those who took the computer-based test. Conversely, the listening comprehension test scores were higher for those who took the computer-based test than for those who took the paper–pencil test. The negative effects of the computer-based test include difficulty in taking notes and a lack of concentration caused by eye fatigue. Although display technology has improved in recent years, participants still preferred reading from paper than reading from a screen to comprehensively understand the presented material [4,5].Most of the previous studies investigating reading comprehension performance in relation to computerized and paper–pencil tests focused on text reading. Information regarding the differences between visual spatial test materials presented on a screen and on paper is also crucial for graphically measuring visuospatial ability. Visuospatial ability is defined as the mental attribute of imagining the shape of an object while it is rotated and remembering the position of the object. This skill involves the cognitive processes of perception, attention, mental imagery, memory, and problem solving. This ability is critical for architects, dentists, chemists, pilots, carpenters, clothing designers, and those who work in similar fields [6]. The visuospatial ability test is used for assessing cognition ability in neurodegenerative disease patients [7], mental development in children [8], and human intelligence [9].The visuospatial ability test can be divided into three elements: mental rotation, spatial perception, and spatial visualization [10]. A large gender advantage in favor of men was identified in only the mental rotation tests [11]. Minor differences were found in the spatial perception tests [10], whereas in the spatial visualization tests, the difference was not substantial [11]. The distinct effect of gender on visuospatial ability was caused by the interaction between life experience and biological propensity [12]. In addition to the gender effect, visuospatial ability performance is also affected by display formats. Van Orden and Broyles [13] compared the visuospatial task performance of participants who used seven types of two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) displays. The authors reported that, overall, the task performance of participants who used the 2-D plan, or side-view, display type was more favorable than the task performance of participants who used any other display system, but the 3-D volumetric display type was more suitable for participants performing integration and prediction tasks in a limited 3-D space.Visuospatial short-term memory assesses the storage demand for visual patterns or sequences of movement without performing further information processing. Traditionally, visuospatial ability and visuospatial short-term memory tests were performed with pen and paper [14] because of the ease of administration and the existence of well-established normative data [15]. However, previous studies did not consider whether the outcome of the computer-based visuospatial ability test would be similar to that of the paper–pencil-based test. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of display media on the subjective preference and the levels of visual fatigue of participants taking the visuospatial ability test and the visuospatial short-term memory test.
