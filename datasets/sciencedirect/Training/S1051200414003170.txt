@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Stochastic resonance offers the possibility of signal amplification by the addition of noise. This curious, interesting phenomenon has received considerable attention since the 1990s. Since such effect has the potential to improve the signal processing performance, intensive works have been done about this topic. One of the most effective implementations of stochastic resonance is in the Collins network, which can provide outstanding performance in that the network output consists of an amplified version of a weak, sub-threshold signal. In practical situations, the sub-threshold signal is easily buried in external noise from the environment. The present paper focuses on the discrete-time system (plus continuous-time system) and analyzes this situation to clarify the performance degradation of the amplification effect. As a countermeasure, we herein propose a novel delay network. The present analysis indicates that the proposed scheme produces an amplification effect in the presence of external noise. The results of the analysis are used to determine the condition for which the delay network is effective, and the results of an experimental evaluation verifies the validity of the analysis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Stochastic resonance (SR) is an interesting phenomenon that describes a constructive action of noise. More than two decades ago, SR was introduced in the context of nonlinear physics [1]. Stochastic resonance can enhance the system response in the presence of noise [2–4], and the effect of SR has been observed in various fields, such as biology [5–7], optics [8], and electronic circuits, including nano-devices [9–11].In the signal processing field, one of the major topics regarding SR is the amplification of weak signals when noise is unavoidable. It is well known that a system with nonlinearity exhibits SR. In this sense, many works consider nonlinear devices/systems, and an attempt is made to detect the weak signal, which many authors refer to as a sub-threshold signal in threshold devices, by adding noise. Traditional nonlinear devices such as comparators and Schmitt triggers have been considered, and the effect of SR have been discussed [2,3,12,13]. Many papers on physics have measured the amplification gain, mainly by using the signal-to-noise ratio [1–3,6,14,15]. Since the goal in signal processing is the detection of a weak signal and/or the transmission of information, some studies have discussed the achieved effect in terms of signal detection performance, including miss-detection and false-detection probabilities [16–19], Fisher information [20] and mutual information [21,22]. The dependence of gain on the noise characteristics has been discussed in [23], and design methods to improve the detection have been reported [24–26]. It is worth mentioned here that signal processing algorithms exhibit the SR effect. S. Kay and his collaborators focused on the hypothesis testing problem, and performance gain by adding noise has been discussed [16,17,23,24]. Decision making is a nonlinear operation, so it exhibits SR. In the same period, F. Chapeau-Blondeau and his collaborators did extensive work focusing on the SR effect in optimum detection including Bayesian estimation and minimax detection [27–33]. Such investigations have made it clear that adding noise makes a contribution to an improvement in the performance of algorithms, which motivates one to apply the essence of SR to Neyman–Pearson detection [13], parameter estimation [22], nonparametric detection [34,35], and the forward error correction scheme [36]. These fundamental studies are good references for the application of SR in the fields of image processing [21,37] and communication systems [38].To increase the SR gain, some studies have focused on establishing an effective SR device: tuning the device parameters including the threshold value [39] and full designing of the device [5,9,12,24,40,41]. One method involves the use of an arrayed system [5,9,20,40,42]. The Collins network is a promising example [5], and theoretical analysis has revealed that with a sufficiently large number of nonlinear devices and identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) noise sources, the system can output the sub-threshold signal itself. Another advantage is the “without tuning” effect. Generally, in order to take advantage of SR, the noise intensity should be tuned. However, this is not necessary in the case of the Collins network. Such advantages have been investigated in many fields, such as biology, neural science [5], nano-devices [9,10], and signal processing [29,32,38,40].The present paper points out the problems with the Collins network in practical applications. To consider the digital signal processing, we focus on a discrete-time system in the analysis, whereas the essence will be discussed in a continuous-time system. The Collins network may encounter the following problems:1.The performance deteriorates when the input to the network is corrupted by noise.Independent noise should be added to the input signal for each device in the network. The performance can be enhanced by increasing the number of noise sources, but this leads to a complicated system.The second contribution of the present paper is the proposal of a novel delay network, which is effective in cases of external noise. The concept of the proposed method was briefly introduced in [45] and the performances were evaluated simply by numerical simulation. The present paper analytically describes the concept, and gives the detailed analysis of the proposed method. Such analysis contributes to make clear the characteristics of the proposed scheme, including the condition in which the proposed method is effective and the performance dependence on both the signal shape and the sampling frequency. The experimental results ensures the validity of the proposed method.The essence of the delay network is the exploitation of a large number of delayed noise. The delayed version of the external noise is uncorrelated with the original noise when the delay is larger than the autocorrelation time for the noise. Such a delay realizes the i.i.d. noise which is included in the Collins network, so that the original sub-threshold signal can be outputted. In the present paper, the concept of the delay network is analytically introduced, and its performance is analyzed to verify its advantages. In the analysis, we focus on a static (memoryless) device, such as a comparator. An A/D converter, which is often used in digital signal processing, is one example of a comparator, and the quantization error will be reduced by utilizing the proposed method as well as the Collins network. The effectiveness of the delay network is also demonstrated experimentally. Note that such a network can have a simple structure. The uncorrelated noise is obtained from the external noise, which means that the delay network itself does not need to contain any noise sources.The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a continuous-time system is considered, and the essence of the problem with the Collins network and the proposed delay network are analytically described. The performance of these networks is analyzed in detail and evaluated numerically in Section 3. For a simple analysis and the application to digital signal processing field, we consider a discrete-time system in this section. The sub-threshold signal is assumed to be square pulse and sampled at a high frequency compared to the Nyquist rate. The analysis clarifies the condition for which the delay network is effective in the white noise case. The situation of correlated noise may also occur, which is assumed in the demonstration in Section 4, and the performance is evaluated for this case. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.This section focuses on a continuous-time system and reviews the Collins network, points out the problems associated with this network, and then introduces the delay network as a countermeasure. The Collins network is a system in which an amplified version of a sub-threshold input signal can be obtained as the network outputy(t)[5]. The network consists of N parallel nonlinear devicesh(x), as shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to simplify the discussion, we consider a static (i.e., memoryless) device. Since the characteristics of the nonlinear devices are identical and they have a threshold, the sub-threshold signals(t)does not appear at the output. In order to obtain the SR effect, the input is added to an i.i.d. internal noiseηi(t), where the subscript i indicates the index of the arrayed nonlinear device. In this addition, the resulting signal can exceed the threshold so that the device can output the sub-threshold signal component. The output of the ith nonlinear device can be expressed simply as(1)yi(t)=h(s(t)+ηi(t))=ys(t)+yiη(t)whereys(t)is the signal component andyiη(t)is the noise component at output i. The signal and noise parts are given byys(t)=〈h′(ηi(t))〉s(t)andyiη(t)=yi(t)−ys(t), respectively, whereh′(x)is the derivative ofh(x)and〈⋅〉is the expectation. Obviously, Eq. (1) is valid under the condition|ys(t)|≈0. Stochastic Taylor expansion [26] givesys(t)=〈h′(η)〉s(t), which implies that the condition is satisfied in two cases:|s(t)|≈0and/or〈h′(η)〉≈0. It is noteworthy that in the latter case, that is, when the characteristic of the nonlinear device has little change such as a comparator, Eq. (1) holds regardless of the input signals(t). Actually, because of the nonlinear effect, the output is usually written in a complicated form, rather than the simple form of the second equation of Eq. (1). To state our idea briefly, in the following, we consider the linear-response regime, the output of which can be a linear combination of the signal and the noise.Due to the noise componentyiη(t), the outputyi(t)should be noisy. The concept of the Collins network is smart because this network eliminates the noise simply by summing the output. Adding i.i.d. noise means that the noise componentyiη(t)is uncorrelated with the noise from other nonlinear devices, i.e.,〈yiη(t)yjη(t)〉−〈yiη(t)〉〈yjη(t)〉=0fori≠j. In this situation, the averaging of the numerous uncorrelated noise components∑i=1Nyiη(t)/Nis equal to the expectation〈yiη(t)〉. Note that〈yiη(t)〉is uncorrelated with the subscript i because of the uncorrelated property ofyiη(t). Then, the network output can be written as follows:(2)y(t)=1N∑i=1N{ys(t)+yiη(t)}=ys(t)+〈yiη(t)〉.The second equality holds in the limitN→∞. Since the value〈yiη(t)〉can be treated as a constant (i.e., a kind of bias), the sub-threshold signal can be obtained. Eliminating the bias term, the Collins network can amplify the sub-threshold signal by the noise (SR) effect.In the original Collins network, which is shown in Fig. 1(a), the input to the network consists of only a sub-threshold signals(t). In a practical situation, such a signal is easily buried in noise. Fig. 1(b) shows such a situation in which the signal is buried in the external noiseζ(t). In this case, the summed outputy(t)is(3)yi(t)=h(s(t)+ζ(t)+ηi(t))=ys(t)+Φ(ζ(t)+ηi(t))(4)y(t)=1N∑i=1Nyi(t)=ys(t)+1N∑i=1NΦ(ζ(t)+ηi(t)).Since the signals(t)is sufficiently smaller than the sum of the noise componentsηi(t)andζ(t), the second equation in Eq. (3) holds and the termΦ(ζ(t)+ηi(t))refers to the noise component at the output. Note that the signal part is given byys(t)=〈h′(ζ(t)+ηi(t))〉s(t). In contrast to the case without external noise, the second noise term in Eq. (4) cannot be eliminated by its expectation, because the average fluctuates according to the common external noise, and the desired sub-threshold signal cannot be obtained. This may be obvious because the Collins network amplifies the input itself, so the common noise component included in the input will be amplified. The present paper evaluates this problem analytically and numerically in the presence of white noise and proposes and demonstrates a countermeasure, which we refer to as the delay network.The proposed network takes the average, in the same manner as the Collins network. Of course, the proposed network also requires an uncorrelated noise component. We obtain the uncorrelated noise component using the basic property of noise, whereby the delayed and non-delayed components of noise are uncorrelated if the delay interval Δ is sufficiently larger than the correlation time for the noise:(5)〈ζ(t)ζ(t+Δ)〉−〈ζ(t)〉〈ζ(t+Δ)〉=0.Based on this concept, applying a suitable time delay to each of the parallel inputs can yield a situation in which the noise components are uncorrelated. Fig. 1(c) shows a diagram of the proposed delay network. The input signal is delayed by different time intervalsΔti. In this case, the delayed signal can be modeled as:(6)s(t+Δti)=s(t)+εi(t)whereεi(t)=s(t+Δti)−s(t)is the error term due to the delay effect. The output of each nonlinear device is(7)yi(t)=h(s(t+Δti)+ζ(t+Δti))=ys(t)+Λ(εi(t)+ζ(t+Δti)),and hence, the network output is(8)y(t)=ys(t)+1N∑i=1NΛ(εi(t)+ζ(t+Δti)).Note that the termΛ(εi(t)+ζ(t+Δti)), which represents the noise at the output of the nonlinear device in the delay network, depends on both the delayed noise and the error termεi(t). The expression in Eq. (8) is similar to Eq. (4), which means that the delay effect should deteriorate the performance. However, the condition(9)εi(t)+ζ(t+Δti)≈ζ(t+Δti)makes the proposed delay network effective. Indeed, under this condition, the termΛ(εi(t)+ζ(t+Δti))≈Λ(ζ(t+Δti))depends only on the noise component. Taking Eq. (5) into consideration, in the limitN→∞,(10)y(t)=ys(t)+1N∑i=1NΛ(ζ(t+Δti))=ys(t)+〈yζ(t)〉.As in the Collins network, the noise term〈yζ(t)〉can be negligible. In other words, the proposed delay network effectively outputs the amplified version of the sub-threshold input signal in a manner similar to the Collins network, even when the signal is corrupted by external noise.The condition in Eq. (9) can be satisfied using a method in whichεi(t)≈0, in other words,(11)s(t+Δti)≈s(t)(i=1,2,⋯,N).One method by which to satisfy this condition is the introduction of a signal having a constant amplitude over a certain time interval, such as a square pulse. In this case, however,εi(t)≠0for any time t since there is certainly a time at which the amplitude will change. The time interval ofεi(t)≠0affects performance, but if it is sufficiently small compared to one having a constant pulse amplitude, the performance degradation can be negligible. Another approach is to introduce a very small physical delay, such as a cable delay, multipath channel, or a millimeter-wave (over 30 GHz) circuit. In these cases, the amplitude of the delayed signal is approximately constant, which satisfies Eq. (11). The shape of the sub-threshold signal does not matter. Note that in a system with a multipath channel, the noise may be added to each channel in addition to the signal source. Fig. 1(b) considers the situations.It is noteworthy that the proposed method can be observed as linear filtering. As shown in Fig. 1(c), all of the arrays have the same nonlinear devices so that they can be replaced by just one device. Since a nonlinear device has no memory effect, the order of the delay and the device is changeable, that is, we have a single nonlinear device followed by a bank of delays. In this case, the bank forms a transversal filter with constant weight, and hence, the output of the nonlinear device is filtered out with a moving average. This low-pass filter is necessary because the output of a static nonlinear device can be viewed as a pulse-density modulated signal and the filter should be a demodulator. This observation implies that the operations of the low-pass filtering of the nonlinear device output give the same performance as the Collins network. Owing to this characteristic, the delay network is of a simple structure, and hence, the alternative version has been proposed in [46]. Fig. 1(a) shows that the Collins network requires N internal noise sources, which results in a complicated system. The proposed delay network can realize the same performance with a single noise source. This will be discussed in the demonstration in Section 4.The discussion in Section 2 focused on continuous time, and the problem in the Collins network, the concept, and the effectiveness of the proposed network were described briefly. In order to verify these assertions, we analytically and numerically investigate the following points:1.The performance of the Collins network is degraded when the input includes external noise.The proposed delay network is effective for noisy input. As mentioned in Section 2, the performance of the proposed method depends on the correlation time of both the signal and the noise. We will next determine the conditions under which the delay network for the square pulse is effective.Performance is often discussed in terms of in–out correlation. The goal of the system is to extract the sub-threshold signals[j]at the output, where j is the time index. In order to measure the accuracy, the correlation between the input sub-threshold signals[j]and the network outputy[j]is suitable because if the desired signal is obtained at the output, the value should be large. We use the correlation C normalized by the amplitude of both the input and the output, which is defined as follows:(12)C=∑j=−M/2M/2−1{y[j]−y¯}{s[j]−s¯}∑j=−M/2M/2−1{y[j]−y¯}2∑j=−M/2M/2−1{s[j]−s¯}2wheres¯=1M∑j=−M/2M/2s[j], andy¯=1M∑j=−M/2M/2y[j]are the mean over samples. Since Eq. (12) gives the normalized in–out correlation, the ideal performance corresponds to 1.0, in which case the network output has the relationy[j]=λs[j], where λ is a constant.In order to simplify the analysis, we use a comparator, which is a basic nonlinear device in SR research. The input–output characteristics can be written as follows:(13)h(x)={+V(x≥ξ)−V(x<ξ)where x is the input of the comparator, and ξ is the threshold.The correlation timeτsof the sub-threshold signal plays an important role in the proposed method. In order to simplify the representation, we choose a single square pulse because the time interval in which the pulse amplitude is constant can be treated asτs. The signal can be expressed as follows:(14)s[j]={+A(−RpM2≤j<RpM2)−A(−M2≤j<−RpM2,RpM2≤j<M2)whereRpis the duty ratio, andRpMand(1−Rp)Mare the numbers of samples with voltages of +A and −A, respectively. Note that in this analysis, the sampling frequency is assumed to be sufficiently large so that these numbers are also large. The desired signal is the high-voltage part of the pulses. In this sense, the correlation time isτs=RpMTs, whereTs=1/fsis the sampling interval. In order to consider sub-threshold signal situations, the amplitude of the signal should be lower than the threshold, i.e.,A<ξ. If noise is added to the desired signal, the result can exceed the threshold, which is the basis of the noise-induced amplification effect of stochastic resonance.We present the basic formula for the Collins network and discuss the advantages of this network. Based on Eq. (13), the comparator can output the voltage +V when the inputxi[j]=s[j]+ηi[j]exceeds the threshold. The decision is made stochastically because the input contains a random variable of the noise termηi[j]. Since the noise is white noise, the probability ofyi[j]is expressed as follows:(15)Pr[yi[j]=+V]=Pr[h(xi[j])=+V]=Pr[s[j]+ηi[j]≥ξ]≡ps[j].The comparator output can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial:(16)yi[j]={+VPr[+V]=ps[j]−VPr[−V]=1−ps[j].The probability that the input exceeds the threshold contains information about the sub-threshold signal, so the signal can be expressed in the output side.The network output is obtained by summing the N comparator outputs, i.e.,y[j]=∑i=1Nyi[j]/N. Since the summation of the Bernoulli random variables is also a random process, we should calculate the expected value of the in–out correlation over the variable. For sufficiently largemin⁡[RpM,(1−Rp)M], wheremin⁡[a,b]denotes the smaller variable between a and b, and a square-pulsed sub-threshold signal, the result can be expressed simply as follows (see Appendix A.1):(17)C¯η=Eη[C]=11+αNwhereEη[z(η)]=∫−∞+∞z(η)ρ(η)dηis the expectation over the internal noise,ρ(⋅)is the probability density function, and(18)α=1(Δp)2{p+−p+21−Rp+p−−p−2Rp}whereΔp=p+−p−. Note that in order to simplify the notation,s[j]=+Ais written simply as “+”, and the opposite voltage is expressed as “−” in the expression ofps[j]. The noise componentyiη(t)in Eq. (1) yields a constant α, which degrades the correlation performance. For large N, the termα/Nin Eq. (17) can be negligible, i.e., the degradation disappears, so that the correlation can reach the ideal performance. This is equivalent to the averaging in Eq. (2). In this situation, the amplified sub-threshold signal can be obtained at the network output. This is the advantage of the Collins network.This section discusses the case shown in Fig. 1(b), in which external noiseζ[i]is added at the network input. In this situation, the Collins network is not effective. We describe this problem analytically and numerically.The network output in this case can be also modeled as in Section 3.1, but the probability that the comparator input exceeds the threshold is not equivalent to Eq. (15). The probability can be expressed as follows:(19)ps[j],ζ=Pr[s[j]+ηi[j]+ζ[j]≥ξ].The input of the network contains the sub-threshold signal and the external noise. In this sense, from a network viewpoint, these parameters cannot be treated as random variables, and the internal noise is the only random variable. This means that the averaged correlation over the internal and the external noise should be taken separately, i.e.,Eη,ζ[z(η,ζ)]=∫−∞+∞z(η,ζ)ρ(η,ζ)dηdζ=Eζ[Eη[z(η,ζ)]]. Since the sub-threshold signal is square pulse, the correlation for largemin⁡[RpM,(1−Rp)M]can be derived as follows (see Appendix A.2):(20)C¯η,ζ=Eη,ζ[C]=11+αζN+σ+,ζ2+σ−,ζ2Eζ2[Δpζ]where(21)αζ=1Eζ2[Δpζ]{Eζ[p+,ζ]−Eζ[p+,ζ2]1−Rp+Eζ[p−,ζ]−Eζ[p−,ζ2]Rp}(22)σs[j],ζ2=Eζ[ps[j],ζ2]−Eζ2[ps[j],ζ]andΔpζ=p+,ζ−p−,ζ. We used the notationp±,ζ=ps[j]=±A,ζas described in Section 3.1. Comparison with the case of no external noise given in Eq. (17) reveals that the external noise introduces a third term in the denominator of Eq. (20). The termsσ+,ζ2andσ−,ζ2are the variances of the probability that exceeds the threshold, which is given in Eq. (19). If the variance of the external noise is increased, the fluctuation in the probability becomes large. In this situation, the output cannot express the sub-threshold signal. From Eq. (20), even if the number of nonlinear devices N is large, these variance terms cause degradation of the correlation performance.Let us evaluate the deterioration by the external noise numerically. Fig. 2shows correlation examples for different degrees of parallelization N. These figures are obtained from Eq. (20), but the value of the expectation over the external noiseEζ[⋅]is obtained numerically. The parameters used here are listed in Table 1. In order to simplify the evaluation, we select white Gaussian noise for both the external and internal noise sources, the variances of which are defined asση2andσζ2, respectively. We then have(23)ps[j],ζ=∫ξ∞12πση2e−(η−s[j]−ζ)22ση2dη.In order to consider the sub-threshold signal, the amplitude of the pulses is smaller than the threshold.In the three cases shown in Fig. 2, the correlation is not monotonic and has a peak for the internal noise variance, which indicates that the Collins network exhibits the SR phenomenon even if external noise is considered. As N increases, the region of high correlation becomes wider. This phenomenon is robust to noise power, and this robustness is referred to as the “without tuning” effect, as reported in the original study on the Collins network [5]. However, as predicted mathematically in Eq. (20), as the external noise increases, the performance decreased gradually even in the ultimate case ofN=∞. As mentioned earlier, this is because the Collins network enhances both the signal and the external noise, both of which are included in the input. The sub-threshold signal component cannot be selectively amplified, so the output contains a noise component and the correlation betweens[t]andy[t]becomes small. Note thatσζ2=0.0corresponds to the ideal case without external noise and yields a correlation of 1.0 inN=∞.As the influence of the external noise increases, the peak performance gradually disappears, as shown in Fig. 2. The peak comes from the second term in the denominator in Eqs. (17) and (20). As the variance of the external noise increases, the third term in Eq. (20) becomes large, and the effect of the second term becomes negligible. Note that the simulation results obtained using the parameters in Table 1 (circles) agree well with the analytical results (lines), which indicates that the analysis is effective.The proposed delay network is analyzed and evaluated in this section. As mentioned in Section 2, the network contains no internal noise source and exploits the external noise. The analysis procedure is similar to that in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, except that the external noise and the delay effect of the comparator input should be considered. The in–out correlation performance is discussed in terms of the amount of external noise, the degree of parallelization N, and the relation between the correlation timeτsof the sub-threshold signal and the delay.Even if the input of the comparator is delayed, the output of each comparator at each time step can still be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. We consider a simple situation in which the delayΔtifollows a sequence with a common time difference Δt:(24)Δti=(i−1)Δt.In the discrete system, Δt may be the sampling intervalTs. The output of the comparator can be expressed as follows:(25)yi[j]=h(s[j−i+1]+ζ[j−i+1])={+VPr[+V]=p˜s[j−i+1]−VPr[−V]=1−p˜s[j−i+1]wherep˜s[l]=Pr[s[l]+ζ[l]≥ξ]is the probability that the comparator input exceeds the threshold ξ owing to the external noise.The output of the delayed network is as follows:(26)y[j]=1N∑i=1Nyi[j]=1N∑i=1Nh(s[j−i+1]+ζ[j−i+1]).As in the case of the Collins network, the above network output can be calculated from binomial distributions (see the detailed derivation in Appendix A.3). However, this output has a different aspect from the Collins network. The output in the Collins network depends on the present sub-threshold signal and the noise components (see Eq. (A.9)). In the delayed network case, the output depends on not only the present components but also the past components. Considering the delay effect (see Eqs. (A.20) through (A.22)) and the square-pulsed sub-threshold signal, the correlation averaged over the external noise for sufficiently largemin⁡[RpM,(1−Rp)M]can be expressed as follows:(27)C¯ζ=Eζ[C]=1−Rc2(1−Rp)1+α˜N−Rc3(1−Rp)where(28)Rc=N−1MRp(29)α˜=1(Δp˜)2{p˜+−p˜+21−Rp+p˜−−p˜−2Rp}andΔp˜=p˜+−p˜−, wherep˜±denotep˜s[j]=±A. The details of the derivation can be found in Appendix A.3.The correlation in Eq. (27) determines the condition under which the proposed delay network is effective. The termRcis the key parameter because it is related to the correlation time of the sub-threshold signal. We refer toRcas the distortion ratio, which can be expressed as follows:(30)Rc=(N−1)ΔtMRpΔt=TDτswhereTD=(N−1)Δtis the maximum amount of the delay. The distortion ratio indicates the degree to which the sub-threshold signal is distorted at the network output, which is a result of the delay procedure. The ultimate case isRc=1.0, i.e.,TD=τs. In this case, the delay network totally distorts the sub-threshold signal, so that the square pulses become triangular (similar to the moving average of square pulses). IfRc≈0, i.e., the sub-threshold signal is constant in the intervalTD, and the distortion is negligible. In this situation, the correlation is reduced to(31)limRc→0⁡C¯ζ=11+α˜N.In this case, the proposed delay network has the same performance as the Collins network and can be realized by the single common external noise source. Eqs. (17) and (31) are the same except that the probabilityp±is replaced byp˜±. If the characteristics of the internal and external noise sources are the same, so thatp±=p˜±, Eq. (17) is equivalent to Eq. (31). This statement holds for largemin⁡[RpM,(1−Rp)M]and is independent of the network size N. If the number of nonlinear devices N increases, the value of the correlation approaches 1.0, which means that the amplified version of the sub-threshold signal can be obtained at the network output in noisy environments.Next, we discuss the results of our analysis based on numerical examples. Fig. 3shows the correlation as a function of the external noise varianceσζ2for different degrees of parallelization N. The parameter settings are shown in Table 1. The time difference Δt is set to be the sampling intervalTs. The number of samplesmin⁡[RpM,(1−Rp)M]is sufficiently large, so that the correlation is well described by Eq. (27), which is denoted by the solid lines. The simulation results are also plotted by “x” symbols and agree well with the analytical results. For reference, the performance of the Collins network is denoted by circles and is obtained using Eq. (17). Note that the performance of the Collins network is plotted for the internal noise rather than the external noise.From this figure, we can observe the following points:•For each N, an optimum value ofσζ2exists at which the correlation is a maximum. This means that the delay network exhibits SR.In the case ofN=1,4,10,100, the distortion ratio approximately equals zero so the performance improves with an increase in N. This results from averaging the noise component at the network output. As indicated mathematically, the performance is the same as that of the Collins network in Fig. 3, and so the above characteristics can be observed in the delay network.WhenN=100000, the performance of the proposed method is degraded compared to the Collins network becauseRc=0.49.To discuss the third point, Fig. 4shows the correlation as a function of the distortion ratio. In this figure, the peak values of the correlation over the external noise variancemaxσζ2⁡[C¯ζ]are plotted. The performance is obtained through numerical simulations using the parameters in Table 1 for varying time differences Δt. If the distortion ratio is large, the network outputs a distorted signal, which deteriorates the correlation. Since the distortion ratio is proportional to the maximum amount of delayTD=(N−1)Δt, a large number of nonlinear devices N means there is an increase in the ratio even if the amount of delay Δt is small. The performance ofN=100000in Fig. 3 is the given case. This is the difference between the proposed method and the Collins network. In the Collins network, performances are improved as the number of nonlinear devices increases. However, since the delay network has the effective condition ofRc≈0, the great number of nonlinear devices deteriorates the network performances. Note that in the case ofN=1, there is no delay effect, so that the values are the same.In the above discussion, we consider the situation in which the key property of the delay network, Eq. (5), is valid. This property implies that the noise components at the network output are uncorrelated. In this sense, we have the conditionΔti>τζfor any i, whereτζis the auto-correlation time of the external noise. Unifying the condition ofRc≈0, the proposed delayed network is valid for a square-pulsed sub-threshold signal under the condition:(32)Δti>τζandRc≈0.The detailed analysis in this section assumes a square-pulsed sub-threshold signal because, based on the discussion in Section 2, such a signal satisfies the condition in Eq. (11). Another effective approach is to have a very high sampling frequency. In this case, the delayΔtican be short enough thats[j−i+1]≈s[j]fori=1,2,⋯,N, i.e., Eq. (11) holds. Note that in this case, the shape of the sub-threshold signal does not matter. In this sense, the proposed delay network is effective for an arbitrary sub-threshold signal in a discrete-time system. To verify this point, Fig. 5shows the performance for two types of sub-threshold signals, i.e., a signal in which the signal amplitude is constant for a certain time interval (square pulse) and a signal in which the signal amplitude varies continuously (sinusoidal:s[j]=Asin⁡(2πj/γ), whereγ=fs/fcis defined as the oversampling rate, which is the sampling frequency normalized by the signal frequency). The performance considered here is the peak value of the correlation over the external noise variancemaxσζ2⁡[C¯ζ]. The performance of the Collins network without external noise is also shown for comparison. In order to evaluate the dependence on the sampling frequency, the performance is plotted as a function of the oversampling rate. Note that these performance values were obtained by numerical simulation, and for the sinusoidal signal, the amplitude A and the frequencyfc=1/Tpwere the same as for the pulsed signal (Table 1). With increasing oversampling rate, the performance of the proposed delay network approaches that for the Collins network. This is true for both types of sub-threshold signal. Therefore, the proposed scheme is effective for an arbitrary sub-threshold signal when a high-frequency sampling device is available.This section shows the effectiveness of the proposed delay network through experiments.Fig. 6shows the experimental setup. The signal and the noise are generated by function generators Agilent 33522A and NF WF1966, respectively. The sub-threshold signal consists of biased periodic square pulses. The duty ratio is 20%, which means that the correlation time isτs=Rpf=0.10[ms]. The high-level voltage is −125 [mV], and the low-level voltage is −175 [mV]. The nonlinear device is a comparator, the threshold of which is set to be 0 [V]. In this situation, the pulsed signal cannot exceed the threshold (sub-threshold signal). However, owing to the external noise, the signal can exceed the threshold, and the comparator can output the signal component. The external noise is Gaussian and white with a bandwidth of 15 MHz. This bandwidth is equivalent to the correlation time of the noiseτζ=21[ns], which is so short that the noise can be treated as white for the sub-threshold signal. In this case, the number of samples isM=2.0×105, which is on the same order as in the case of Table 1.Before the input to the comparator, the signal is delayed by using long coaxial cables. In this experiment, we consider the situation in whichN=4. Four cables of different lengths (1.5, 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 m) are used, and the resulting delays are shown in Fig. 6(b). Based on this figure, the maximum delayTDis 43.0 [ns]. The distortion ratioRcis 0.00043, which means that the delay network does not distort the shape of the sub-threshold signal at the network output. We limited the experiment toN=4, since for larger values of N, longer cables are required, which unintentionally act as low-pass filters. This decreased the signal and noise power and extended the auto-correlation time for noise that did not meet the condition in Eq. (32).The comparator output is summed using a voltage summer, which is measured using a Tektronix DP07104 digital oscilloscope. The obtained signal data is used to calculate the in–out correlation based on Eq. (12), which is shown in Fig. 7. Note that the curves forN=20,100were calculated on a computer by using the measured signal data and its delayed version. The performance is plotted as a function of the root mean square of the external noise voltage. The non-monotonic curve indicates that the delay network exhibits SR in the experiments. For reference, the figure also shows the performance for the case of a single comparator (i.e.N=1). The delay network has a better performance than the single comparator, which experimentally confirms that the proposed method is effective in practical situations. The analytical model describes the peak value and the shape of the experimental curve reasonably well. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in practical situations. However, there is still a discrepancy between the analysis and the experiment, for example in the peak height for the single comparator. This is because the experimental setup could not completely reproduce the situation in the analysis. For instance, the long cable used in the present study unintentionally limits the bandwidth and acts as a low-pass filter. This might decrease the noise power and affect the peak height and position. This would also be expected to extend the auto-correlation time of the noise simultaneously, which would degrade the effect of the delayed network. Further study considering the details of the experimental system is necessary for more quantitative discussion.
