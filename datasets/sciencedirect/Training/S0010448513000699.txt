@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Percutaneous heart valve replacement is currently limited to the replacement of pulmonary and aortic valves in a targeted group of patients. Designing a heart valve for mitral valve replacement is further limited by its distinctive anatomical feature, which places a constraint on its range of design options. To overcome such limitations, the objectives of this study were to use computational modeling and simulation to design a new nitinol-based mitral valve stent and evaluate its crimpability and fatigue behavior. A self-expandable stent with new features that could address the issues of valve migration and paravalvular leaks was generated using the CAD-based conceptual modeling. Its expansion, crimpability, deployment patterns, and fatigue behavior were simulated and analyzed. Our simulations incorporated cyclic cardiac muscle loading, cyclic blood pressure loading, as well as cyclic valve-leaflet forces in the fatigue life assessment for mitral valves. Our results showed that the stent model passed the fatigue test under the aforementioned loading conditions. Our model provides a simple, fast and cost-effective tool to quantitatively determine the fatigue resistance of stent components. This is of great value to the design of new prosthetic heart valve models, as well as to surgeons involved in valve replacement.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mitral valve repairs or replacements are good viable treatment options for mitral valve disease. However, these methods involve open heart surgery with their own risks of mortality and morbidity, especially in the elderly and co-morbid patient population  [1]. There remains a need for a less invasive way of treating heart valve disease. Transcatheter heart valve replacement is getting popular amongst cardiology and cardiovascular surgical procedures following the reporting of satisfactory early clinical experiences  [2]. However, the use of this technique is increasing in the replacement of pulmonary and aortic valves than the repair and replacement of mitral valves  [3]. The major reasons for this trend are the delivery of a relatively large prosthesis, device anchorage, chordae tendineae issue, and paravalvular leaks  [4]. Furthermore, fatigue resistance is equally important as it governs the durability of the stent.Stent fatigue is a major complication following device implantation and must be carefully considered in the design phase of percutaneous heart valve  [5]. Mechanical failure can occur due to static fracture when the mechanical strength of the material is exceeded by over expansion or crimping, or due to fatigue failure from the cyclic pressure loads and cyclic leaflet forces exerted upon the stent  [6]. Fatigue failure is of particular importance as the artificial heart valve will be subjected to a cyclic loading over 400 million cycles, which equates to approximately a life span of 10–15 years  [7]. Stent resistance, on the other hand, depends on the material used to develop the stent. Due to its superelasticity, high flexibility and ease of deployment methodology, nitinol is a preferred choice as the material for self-expanding valve stents. Contrary to conventional engineering materials, nitinol stent fracture is not stress based but strain based, where the oscillating strain amplitude is the main contributor to fatigue behavior  [8]. Recent research works investigated the effects of mean and alternating strains on the fatigue behavior of superelastic nitinol and observed that the alternating strain has a greater effect on fatigue life than the mean strain  [9]. For example, based on 432 nitinol diamond-shaped stent specimens that were exposed to a maximum life of 107 cycles, nitinol stents had an endurance limit of 0.4% strain  [10]. Currently, maximum principal strain is generally used to investigate nitinol stent fracture  [11].Available numerical studies regarding nitinol stents are more focused on the computational simulation of stent designs, since the stent is an important part of the stented valve assembly from fatigue resistance standpoint  [12]. Hence in the current study, a nitinol based new stent was designed and its deployment in the mitral annulus and resistance to fatigue failure were investigated. Following FDA guidelines, computational analysis of a new stent was carried out, employing the finite element solver ABAQUS (Dassault Systemes, MA). The whole design process of the mitral valve stent development includes CAD geometrical generation, computer modeling and simulation of structural strength and fatigue, and experimental testing on anchorage and leakage of the prototype. Here we mainly discuss the design and analysis of the mechanical performance of the stent in terms of its crimpability and fatigue resistance as part of the whole iterative design process.
