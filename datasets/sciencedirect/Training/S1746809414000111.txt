@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work investigates the use of switching linear Gaussian state space models for the segmentation and automatic labelling of Stage 2 sleep EEG data characterised by spindles and K-complexes. The advantage of this approach is that it offers a unified framework of detecting multiple transient events within background EEG data. Specifically for the identification of background EEG, spindles and K-complexes, a true positive rate (false positive rate) of 76.04% (33.47%), 83.49% (47.26%) and 52.02% (7.73%) respectively was obtained on a sample by sample basis. A novel semi-supervised model allocation approach is also proposed, allowing new unknown modes to be learnt in real time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Sleep is categorized in five stages with each stage having unique characteristics including variations in wave patterns, eye movements and muscle tone [1]. The first four sleep stages capture the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep while the fifth stage captures rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The NREM stages are nowadays also referred to as Stages N1, N2 and N3, where N3 encompasses the previous Stage 3 and Stage 4, and the REM stage is referred to as the R stage [2]. This work focuses primarily on electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during Stage 2 (N2) sleep which is one of the most informative stages for an electroencephalographer searching for clinical abnormalities [3]. During this stage, EEG signals are characterized by spindles and K-complexes which according to the AASM manual of sleep scoring [2] are defined as:Spindle   A train of distinct waves having a frequency of 11–16Hz with a duration ≥ 0.5s, usually maximal in amplitude over central brain regions.K-complex   A well delineated negative sharp wave immediately followed by a positive component with a total duration ≥ 0.5s, typically maximal at frontal electrodes.Manual scoring of these two morphologically distinct waveforms which are hallmarks of Stage 2 sleep is time consuming and risks being subjectively interpreted. Thus automatic identification of these modalities would be beneficial. This has led various researchers to formulate approaches which could reliably distinguish these transient events in sleep EEG recordings. These approaches range from period-amplitude analysis [4,5], spectral analysis through Fourier transform [6], wavelets [7] and matching pursuit [8], as well as autoregressive modelling [6]. Literature comparison of the performance obtained by different techniques is difficult because (a) dissimilar performance measures are used, (b) results are highly dependent on the manual scorers whose scoring serves as ground truth and (c) different measures are taken to reduce the problems related to human based scoring. Babadi et al. [9] for example, quote the false positive rate as the number of false alarms per second, while Devuyst et al. [5] measure this as the ratio of the number of false positives to the sum of false positives and true negatives. When different experts have labelled the same data, some authors compare results with the union of the individual scores [5] while others go through several steps to obtain a consensus scoring [10]. There is therefore no gold standard in evaluating system performance and the variance between scorers makes any measure difficult to compare objectively.Most approaches found in the literature have been designed for the detection of either spindles or K-complexes separately. Although these approaches may be applied on the same dataset to identify both of these transient events there are no studies, to the best of our knowledge, that evaluate how the presence of one event can affect the detection of the other, considering that both are normally present in the recording. Furthermore, the approach generally taken is episodic, that is, to identify whether an epoch of the data contains one of these events. This necessitates the segmentation of the EEG recording into epochs, risking that an epoch border might occur during the transition from one event to another and thus restricting the detection of the exact transition point.The main contribution of this work is an investigation on the use of switching multiple models [11] for the automatic detection of spindles and K-complexes in sleep EEG data. We show that this approach allows for the continuous segmentation of data which is known to switch arbitrarily and abruptly from one mode of operation to another in time, as is the case with Stage 2 sleep. Specifically we investigate the use of linear Gaussian models to represent the different modes and show that the results obtained by other authors [12,13] on data other than EEG, where lower bounding approximations were used to handle the growing number of possible mode sequences, is generalizable to sleep EEG data. Furthermore we introduce a novel approach of extending the switching multiple model framework to a semi-supervised approach which can learn new unknown modes in real time.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the theory behind switching multiple models and goes into the proposed approach of identifying and learning new modes through a semi-supervised learning process. Section 3 then presents the sleep EEG data used for this analysis and the results obtained when using linear Gaussian switching multiple models for the identification of spindles and K-complexes. The identification of new modes is also discussed towards the end of this section. The paper then ends with an overall discussion and conclusion, highlighting the benefits of using the proposed switching multiple model approach for sleep EEG data segmentation.
