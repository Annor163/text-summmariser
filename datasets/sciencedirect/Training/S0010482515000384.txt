@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Accurate modeling of biological soft tissue properties is vital for realistic medical simulation. Mechanical response of biological soft tissue always exhibits a strong variability due to the complex microstructure and different loading conditions. The inhomogeneity in human artery tissue is modeled with a computational probabilistic approach by assuming that the instantaneous stress at a specific strain varies according to normal distribution. Material parameters of the artery tissue which are modeled with a combined logarithmic and polynomial energy equation are represented by a statistical function with normal distribution. Mean and standard deviation of the material parameters are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) and inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method, respectively. This nondeterministic approach was verified using computer simulation based on the Monte-Carlo (MC) method. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the MC simulation corresponds well with that of the experimental stress–strain data and the probabilistic approach is further validated using data from other studies. By taking into account the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of human biological tissue, the proposed method is suitable for realistic virtual simulation as well as an accurate computational approach for medical device validation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Accurate modeling of biomechanical properties of artery tissue is important for developing realistic medical simulation systems which are commonly used in surgical training, planning and treatment, and diagnostic tools for vascular diseases. With the advancements in medical imaging technologies and mapping tools, model personalization has generated a lot of research interest [25,38]. Efficient probabilistic model personalization integrating the specific patient data to a generic model enables the application of computational approaches in clinical practice [1]. This study characterizes the patient specific material parameters and validates the models using experimental data of human iliac vessels.Nonlinear hyperelastic property is an important attribute of the artery tissue which can contribute to modeling accuracy, and hence needs to be considered for realistic deformation simulation and haptic rendering in surgical simulation of the arterial wall [43]. Experimental procedures such as inflation tests [17], biaxial tests [42], as well as tension and indentation tests [11,26] have been performed to study the mechanical properties of arteries tissue. Those experiments revealed that the mechanical behaviour of arteries is elastic, highly non-linear and anisotropic under finite strains for slow monotonic tests, and have been adequately modeled within the framework of hyperelasticity.Many constitutive models have been proposed for mathematical description of the mechanical behaviour of artery tissue [15,22–34]. Strain energy based models are able to provide comprehensive understanding of the inter-relationship between stress and strain. In Chui et al.’s study [5], the combined logarithmic and polynomial model was reported to perform better than the combined exponential and polynomial model [15] in modeling the stress–strain relationship of liver tissue. The combined logarithmic and polynomial model has been utilized for realistic modeling of porcine artery tissue [47]. Structural strain energy function is proposed to study the arterial tissue [48]. The proposed function includes the wavy nature of the collagen and the fraction of both elastin and collagen contained in the media, which can be determined by histology. The waviness of the collagen is assumed to be distributed log-logistically. The novel strain energy function is found to behave similarly to that of Holzapfel et al. [22], both succeed in describing the typical S-shaped pressure–radius curves with comparable quality of fit.Uniaxial stress tests have been performed on human artery tissue to study its nonlinear biomechanical properties in this work. Due to varying micro-structural composition of tissue specimens and inherent noises from experimental instruments, the measured stress–strain data often comprise of a number of stress–strain curves with large deviations [36]. Material parameters of soft tissue model are usually characterized using the mean stress–strain curve and ignoring the stress–strain curve deviations. However, it is important to incorporate the inherent stiffness variations for realistic medical simulation [14]. These inherent stiffness variations of artery tissue may be modeled using probabilistic uncertainty analysis. The applicability of probabilistic uncertainty analysis has been demonstrated in evaluating structural reliability [9,10], and knee ligamentous constraint analysis [4]. A probabilistic method was proposed to model the mechanical properties of liver tissues in [14]. To our best knowledge, few reports have been published on probabilistic analysis of human artery for characterization and deformation simulation in the literature.In this study, we introduce a probabilistic approach to model the inhomogeneity, specifically the stiffness variations of human artery tissue. Cyclic tension tests in longitudinal and circumferential directions were performed on human arteries. The arteries are highly inhomogeneous with large variances in stress–strain curves. In order to study the anisotropic mechanical properties of arterial tissue, a combined logarithmic and polynomial constitutive equation [5,47] is employed to model the average stress–strain relationship of human artery tissue in circumferential and longitudinal directions. The material parameters are expressed as a statistical function with normal distribution. The mean values of the material parameters are identified using GA while the standard deviation of the material parameters are determined using direct calculation method (DC) and inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method, respectively. The probabilistic approach is then verified using Monte-Carlo (MC) method and demonstrates good correspondence with cumulative distribution function (CDF) between simulated and experimental stress–strain data. Validation of the material parameters are carried out with experimental human artery data.In Section 2, the probabilistic approach is introduced and material parameters are determined from the scattered experimental stress–strain data. Section 3 presents the verification of derived material parameters through MC simulation and historical experimental data. Section 4 concludes the study with a short summary.There are three types of arteries: elastic, mixed and muscular. Abdominal aorta, femoral artery and popliteal artery are examples of elastic, mixed and muscular arteries respectively [6]. Uniaxial elongation tests were performed on 20 samples of human femoral arteries from 5 donors in circumferential and longitudinal directions, average 4 samples from each donor. The experiments were carried out with a mechanical property measurement system which was designed to meet the requirements of automated environment control, testing, and data collection for biological tissue [47], as shown inFig. 1. Load cells (LCM UF series) were employed to measure force imposed on specimen. Human femoral arteries were obtained from human donors and stored in an ice box with Histidine Tryptophan Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution before experiment for about 2 weeks’ time. The arteries were intended for organ transplant, and the donors’ identities were protected in according to an approved Institutional Review Board protocol. All arterial specimens were excised from the distal end of the abdominal aorta, with lengths between 40 and 50mm and diameters between 6 and 11mm. During experiment, the artery specimen was immersed in Krebs Ringer solution at 37°C throughout the experiment, with pH value maintained at 7.3–7.4 using carbon dioxide, which is designed to improve the test accuracy by mimicking the inner environment of human body.Specimens were tested in both circumferential and longitudinal directions. A ring segment was sliced off from one end of each arterial specimen and tested in circumferential direction. The remaining section of the specimen was used to perform tests in the longitudinal direction. All specimens were preconditioned before data collection over a course of at least five cycles, allowing the specimens to reach a steady state as no further changes occurred on the stress–strain curves [16,44]. During the experiments, force and displacement data were measured and recorded. Stretch ratio λ was calculated by dividing instantaneous gauge length by its original length while engineering stress T was calculated by dividing the instantaneous load by the original cross-sectional area. Strainεcan be expressed asλ−1. The tension tests were performed until the stretch ratio reached 1.55 for both directions at a ramping speed of 2.5mm/s.Two sets of scattered stress–stain curves which represent the data in circumferential and longitudinal directions were plotted together with its mean curve inFig. 2. Each set includes twenty curves. The experimental stress with respect to a specific stretch ratio is assumed to vary according to normal distribution. Mean value and standard deviation of stress is calculated as:(1)μT=1N∑i=1NTi,(2)σTi=1N∑i=1N(Ti−μT)2,where Tidenotes the experimental stress value and N is the number of experimental stress values. Experimental results of minimum, mean and maximum stress–strain curve are also illustrated inFig. 3. The probability density function (PDF) of the stress values calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) at three different strain values are plotted in Fig. 3 which shows the normal distribution of stress values. The experimental data is tested using Shapiro–Wilk test [39]. The average probabilities of normality in circumferential and longitudinal directions are 0.7185 and 0.7237, which validate the assumption of normal distribution.Probabilistic method is used for material parameter identification of artery tissue. Deformation of artery tissue is considered as a structural problem that can be solved using the probabilistic method.The artery tissue is represented by a 7-constant combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function as follows:(3)W=−C12ln(1−u)+q2,where(4)u=12C2(I1−3)2+12C3(I4−1)2+C4(I1−3)(I4−1),(5)q=C5(I1−3)2+C6(I4−1)2+2C7(I1−3)(I4−1).W denotes the strain energy function,C1…C7are the material parameters, I1, I2 and I4 are strain invariants which are functions of stretch ratio λ,I1=λ2+2/λ,I2=2λ+1/λ2,I4=λ2.With the combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function, relationship between engineering stress T and stretch ratio λ is derived as follows:(6)T=f(λ)=(2C1(C2(λ2+(2/λ)−3)+C4(λ2−1)1−G/2)+2C5(λ2+2λ−3)+2C7(λ2−1))(λ−1/λ2)+(2C1(C3(λ2−1)+C4(λ2+(2/λ)−3)1−G/2)+2C6(λ2−1)+2C7(λ2+(2/λ)−3))λ,where(7)G=C2(λ2+2λ−3)−C3(λ2−1)2+2C4(λ2+2λ−3)(λ2−1).Material parameters of the mean stress–strain curve can be characterized using the above equation.The identification process was carried out using genetic algorithm (GA). GA is an effective global search method which is well suited for the minimization of non-convex objective functions. The mean value curve is available for material parameter identification through a data set of the form(8){[xi,yi]i=1,…,Np},where xiis the experimental strain measure while yiis the corresponding recordings of stress measure, Npis the number of data points collected from the experiment.The best-fit values of selected parameters(9)CT={{CN}N=1,…,7},are sought,.(10)CT∈D=[C1lb,C1ub]×⋯×[C7lb,C7ub].with the parameter set CT, numerical simulations of the experiments can be employed to obtain a set of predictions(11){[xi,yi(CT)]i=1,…,Np}.The fitness function is:(12)R(CT)=∑iN(yi(CT)−yi).This lead to the multivariate minimization problem(13)minC∈DR(CT),which is expected to be non-convex and affected by multiple local optima [33].Starting with random values assigned to parameters data set CTas the initial solution population, the algorithm will evaluate their level of fitness in the problem domain and create a new set of approximations based on breeding the better evaluated solutions. By repeating the selection, crossover and mutation procedures of the GA, the evolution of populations of individuals that are better suited to their environment than their parents are obtained. The minimum value of R(CT) is reached, too. An initial population of nearly 100 individuals was used along with a selection percentage of 0.1 and a crossover percentage of 0.7. The algorithm converges to minima after approximately 100 generations while the number of total evolution generations is set to be 150.Two methods were employed to calculate the standard deviation of material parameters. The first method is called direct calculating method (DC method), which utilizes the standard way to calculate the standard deviation of predicted stress (σTi) as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). The second method is the Inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method.The IMVFOSM method is derived as follows. By first taking Taylor expansion of Eq. (6), the performance function is linearized at the mean values of material parameters:(14)T≅f(μC)+∑i=1n∂f∂Ci|μC(Ci−μCi),whereμC=[μC1,μC2,…,μC7]Tis the mean values ofC=[C1,C2,…,C7]T.The mean value and standard deviation of predicated T can be estimated by(15)μT≅f(μC),Thus, the stand deviation of engineering stress is derived as(16)σT≅T−f(μC)=∑i=1n(∂f∂Ci|μCCi−μCi)2LetσC=Ci−μCidenotes the standard deviation of material parameters in Eq. (6), so(17)σT≅∑i=1n(∂f∂Ci|μCσCi)2,whereσCidenotes the standard deviation of material parameter Ci.Since the standard deviationσTof experimental engineering stress T and∂f/∂Cican be calculated, the standard deviation of material parameterσCican be determined using the IMVFOSM method by solving the inverse equations in Eq. (15).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, an effective probabilistic approach is proposed to represent the mechanical properties of human artery tissue incorporating the inherent stiffness variations between different subjects. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis is carried out to model the uncertainties of human artery tissue. The combined logarithmic and polynomial energy function has modeled the human arterial behaviour accurately, and our proposed probabilistic approach is able to implement with other hyperelastic models, such as the Holzapfel model [21] or Ogden model [32]. Interaction between the uncertainties on observations and estimated parameters is a major phenomenon to consider in biomechanical models for medical simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which utilizes a statistical model to study the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of human arterial tissue.None.
