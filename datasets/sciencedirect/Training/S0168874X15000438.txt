@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this work, we propose a new enhancement strategy that can be applied to the calculated strain field in the analyses of shells by the unconstrained-vector finite element approach, a Solid-Shell-like formulation. This new enhancement is proposed to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stresses fields in the transverse direction. The kinematic enhancement is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, we propose an alternative plastic flow rule, which includes a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and a general failure surface that degenerates into the von-Mises or Drucker−Prager criteria for isotropic materials. The resulting alternative position-based finite element and the enhanced field strategies are tested for elastic and elastoplastic situations by comparing the results with other solutions and known benchmarks.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool for structural analysis and in its most common version is based on the stationary total potential energy principle. For plate and shell analyses, it is usual to assume rotations and simplified displacement fields in the thickness direction to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. These simplified displacement fields are usually classified as the Classical Laminated Theory, First-Order Theory and subsequent Higher-Order Theories [1]. However, the starting points of these approaches are the Kirchhoff−Love kinematics [2,3] and the Reissner−Mindlin kinematics [4–6]. Before describing recent studies on this subject, it is important to note that the position-based formulation presented here is a Solid-Shell-like approach that was developed initially for homogeneous shells [7,8], does not consider rotations as variables and naturally allows thickness variation therefore, it cannot be classified as one of the displacement-rotation approaches mentioned above.In existing finite element (FE) formulations for laminated plates and shells, the adopted transverse displacement fields are usually continuously differentiable [9,10]. Therefore, the resulting strain field is also continuous and, because the constitutive relation is discontinuous (constant in each lamina), the achieved stress field becomes discontinuous. Several important recent studies [11–16] have focused on improving the stress analysis and other issues by following the displacement−rotation formulations of laminated plates and shells. Readers are invited to read these studies for important information and a good review on the subject of displacement−rotation-based formulations.The so-called hybrid method is an alternative FE procedure that can be used to improve the accuracy of stress fields in FEMs in which the stress (or strain) fields are introduced as new variables [17,18]. In these techniques, Lagrange multipliers can be employed to partially enforce the continuity conditions and compatibility for inter-elemental fields. These Lagrange multipliers are the energy conjugate values of the new unknowns of the problem and increase the number of degrees of freedom. A well-known strategy that improves the shear stress continuity along the thickness in rotation−displacement formulations is the layer-wise theory [1,19]. The thickness of the plate or shell elements is divided into a suitable number of sub-elements that are usually coincident with the physical laminas, and each is described by a First-Order Theory. The top and bottom displacements of each lamina are forced to match the displacements of adjacent laminas. This procedure results in N sub-elements with 2N+3 independent displacements, which increases the number of degrees of freedom [19–21].This study introduces a position-based FEM to address the development of plasticity and large deformations in laminated plates and shells. The formulation is different from previous formulations in that it does not use the concepts of rotation and displacements. Moreover, the strain field that is calculated from the alternative kinematics is enhanced to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stress fields in the transverse direction of laminated plates and shells. The kinematics are enhanced based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field.The initial positional mapping is called pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics [5–7] because no enhancements are imposed and the shear strain is constant along the thickness (discontinuous stress). We call basic kinematics the improvement to the pure kinematics introducing a variable that allows linear thickness variation [8] that avoids volumetric and shear locking in both thin and thick plates and shells. The enhancement is proposed based on these initial kinematics. This procedure guarantees good results from the basic kinematics [8,22] for transverse displacements and stresses parallel to the reference surface without increasing the number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, using the proposed enhancement, transverse strains will be discontinuous, which provides the desired continuity of stresses.It should be noted that some versions of the well-established Solid-Shell finite element approach [23–30] precedes our formulation on using vectors instead of rotations to solve shells problems; therefore our approach is classified as a Solid-Shell-like formulation. There are two main differences between these formulations. The first and less important difference is that positions are used as variables instead of displacements. The second is that the Solid-Shell formulation when written as function of mid surface, directors and thickness [25] “imposes a multiplicative decomposition of the director field into an inextensible vector part and a scalar stretching part” [23], and our formulation does not.To complete the formulation, an alternative non-associative orthotropic elastoplastic constitutive relation is presented and used with the proposed strain enhancement. This elastoplastic formulation is based on controlling the volume change in the plastic phase, which reduces locking problems [31,32]. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, the hardening parameter is not a fixed scalar but depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and on the intensity of the current stress state. Examples are shown to demonstrate the good behavior of the solution and the final stress behavior in the transverse direction. Most sections of this paper use dyadic notation; however, index notation is employed in some parts of the text to facilitate understanding.This section describes the general solution to our mechanical problem, i.e., large deformations of plates and shells that include continuous transverse stresses and plasticity. Two important issues are raised from the solution process: the need to adopt a kinematics and the consideration of a coherent constitutive relation. These issues will be explored in the next sections. To solve the mechanical problem, we use the principle of stationary total potential energy. The problem is assumed to be isothermal, and external loads are considered to be conservative. Therefore, the total potential energy is written as:(1)Π=∫V0θ(E,α)dV0−∫S0p⋅ymds0−F⋅Ywhereθis the internal energy, which is usually called the Helmholtz free energy potential, from which both elastic and plastic constitutive relations will be developed,Fis the concentrated external conservative load vector,Yis the nodal position vector, which includes all degrees of freedom,pis the conservatively distributed load with respect to the reference surface positionymof the shell or plate,αis an internal variable that controls plasticity,V0is the total volume of the body, andS0is the surface of the body.The variation of Eq. (1) is equal to zero at the equilibrium position. Therefore, a position-based formulation consists of finding a positionYthat satisfies the assumption:(2)δΠ=0Because the main variable of the problem isY, we rewrite Eq. (2) as(3)δΠ=∫V0∂θ∂YdV0⋅δY−∫S0ϕ⊗ϕds0P⋅δY−F⋅δY=0whereϕis the set of shape functions that is related to the reference surface of the shell elements (see Eqs. (12) and (13)),Pis the nodal value of the distributed applied forces, andδYis the arbitrary variation of positions.The first term in Eq. (3) can be further developed,(4)∂θ∂Y=∂θ∂E:∂E∂YEq. (4) shows the need to relate the Green strainEto the nodal positionsYby an adopted kinematics.By the energy conjugate assumption (see Eq. (73)) for a detailed explanation), one finds(5)∂θ∂E=SwhereSis the Second Piola−Kirchhoff stress, which reveals the necessity of developing a coherent constitutive relation.Introducing Eq. (5) into (3) results in(6)δΠ=(∫V0S:∂E∂YdV0−∫S0ϕ⊗ϕds0P−F)⋅δY=0This equation is clearly nonlinear, and the Newton−Raphson procedure is described as follows. The solution process starts by rewriting the equilibrium Eq. (6) to remove the arbitrary variation of positions (δY) and introducing the unbalanced force vector (g) as(7)g(Y)=∫V0∂θ∂E:∂E∂YdV0−M⋅P−F=0Moreover, the integral term can be called an internal force, which simplifies Eq. (7) as(8)g(Y)=Fint−M⋅P−F=0Because the process is nonlinear, Eq. (7) is expanded in a Taylor series from a trial positionY0:(9)g(Y)≅g(Y0)+∂g∂Y|Y0⋅ΔY=0Solving the linear system of Eq. (9) one finds the position correction, which is applied asY=Y+ΔYuntil|ΔY|/|X|<tol, in whichtolis the tolerance in positions, andXis the initial nodal positions of the body. Because the applied forces are conservative, the derivative ofgwith respect to the positions results in the Hessian (or tangent stiffness matrix) as(10)H=∂g∂Y=(∂E∂Y:∂2θ∂E∂E:∂E∂Y+S:∂2E∂Y∂Y)in which(11)∂2θ∂E∂E=ℭtanis the tangent constitutive tensor, which is given in Eq. (105). The derivatives of the Green strain with respect to the positions come from Eqs. (18), (21) and (23) and are detailed in references [7,8].To describe the general kinematics, we begin with a homogeneous shell and generate the initial expressions. The initial kinematic assumption is that a straight line that is initially orthogonal to the reference surface of a plate (or shell) will remain straight but not necessarily orthogonal to the reference surface after deformation. Although this line may change size (thickness variation), this assumption is similar to the original Reissner−Mindlin hypothesis [5,6] and will be called pure kinematics as was presented by [7] and is depicted inFig. 1.In Fig. 1, a generic pointxin the initial configuration is written as a function of a pointxmon the reference surface and a generic vectorg0. Using the same procedure, a generic pointyin the current configuration is written as a function of a pointymon the reference surface and a generic vector (unconstrained)g1. These variables are written as functions of the non-dimensional coordinates(ξi)and generate the initial (f0) and current (f1) mappings as well as their corresponding gradients (A0andA1), which are written as(12)fi0=xi=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Xℓi+h02ξ3ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Nℓi0(13)fi1=yi=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Yℓi+h02ξ3ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Gℓi(14)gi0=h02ξ3ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Nℓi0(15)gi1=h02ξ3ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Gℓi(16)Aij0=∂fi0∂ξj=fi,j0,Aij1=∂fi1∂ξj=fi,j1whereϕℓis a shape function (a third-order polynomial in this study) that is related to nodeℓ,XℓiandYℓiare the initial and current positions of nodeℓ, respectively,Nℓi0andGℓiare the initial and current generalized vectors related to nodeℓ, respectively, andh0is the initial thickness of the shell; see [7] for additional details.The deformation functionfis not explicitly written; however, its gradient is calculated fromA0andA1as proposed by [7,8,33](17)A=Grad(f)=A1⋅(A0)−1The Green strain is written as(18)E=12[At⋅A−I]=12[C−I]The pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics (Eqs. (17) and (18)) will be used to generate the desired strain enhancement modes in Section 5. However, the resulting enhancement will be applied to Eq. (20), which is called the basic kinematics.The basic kinematics (that will be enhanced) is are developed by introducing the linear rate of thickness variation (scalar), which is parameterized by its nodal valuesT¯ℓ[8],(19)T(ξ1,ξ2)=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)T¯ℓinto expression (42) as follows:(20)fi1=yi=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Yℓi+h02[ξ3+ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)T¯ℓξ32]ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)GiℓThis kinematic eliminates volumetric and shear locking from the usual homogeneous or laminated shell formulations [8]. Higher-order polynomials can be used to improve the basic kinematics even more; this has been done in studies of rotation−displacement formulations [1,9,10]. However, creating continuous displacement fields does not generate continuous stress fields.In Section 5, we propose a strain enhancement for the position-based formulation that generates a more coherent stress distribution in the transverse direction without increasing the number of degrees of freedom.The nonexistence of a finite rotation description allows the laminate kinematics to be understood using a simple two dimensional representation, which is depicted inFig. 2.Based on Fig. 2, the new formulae for the initial and current mappings are developed by substituting(h0/2)ξ3in Eqs. (12), (13) and (20) with(dlam+(h0lam/2)ξ3), where the superscript lam indicates the considered lamina. From this consideration, Eqs. (12), (13) and (20) can be rewritten for any lamina as:(21)fi0lam=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Xℓi+(dlam+h0lam2ξ3)ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Niℓ0(22)fi1=yi=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Yℓi+(dlam+h0lam2ξ3)ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Giℓ(23)fi1lam=ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)Yℓi+[(dlam+h0lam2ξ3)+ϕℓ(ξ1,ξ2)T¯ℓ(dlam+h0lam2ξ3)2]ϕk(ξ1,ξ2)Gikwheredlamis the distance from the reference surface to the center of the considered lamina in the directiongi0in the initial configuration, andh0lamis the initial thickness of the lamina. The rate of thickness variation of each laminaT¯ℓlamcan be recovered from its average representationT¯ℓbyT¯ℓlam=(h0lam/2)T¯ℓ; see [22].Applying Eq. (16) over to Eqs. (21) and (23) results in the deformation gradient, Eq. (17), for the basic kinematics (T¯ℓ≠0) or the pure kinematics (T¯ℓ=0). As a result, the Green strain (Eq. (18)) is written as a function of the nodal positions. The correspondences between the general degrees of freedom of the solution process (Section 2) and those defined for the proposed kinematics for nodeℓareY1ℓ=Y1ℓ,Y2ℓ=Y2ℓ,Y3ℓ=Y3ℓ,Y4ℓ=Tℓ,Y5ℓ=G1ℓ,Y6ℓ=G2ℓandY7ℓ=G3ℓ.In Sections 2 and 3, the variables are defined in the global coordinate system. However, because the adopted constitutive model considers an orthotropic material for each lamina of the plate (or shell), it is necessary to create a local coordinate system at each integration point that follows the local orthotropic coordinate system. The constitutive relation and the new kinematics enhancement will be applied in this system.Fig. 3 shows the adopted Lagrangian orthotropic directions at a specific point. The third orthotropic direction is the normal to the plate or shell surface, which is calledri3. The first orthotropic direction (ri1) belongs to the plane (π) that is generated by the third orthotropic direction and a global directionoithat is defined by the user. Plane (π) is also orthogonal to the second (ri2) orthotropic direction. This implies that the vector product betweenri3andoigeneratesri2, and the vector product betweenri2andri3generatesri1(Fig. 3).The desired rotation matrix is thereforerijor simplyRin dyadic notation. To apply the proposed enhancement, we rotate the nodal positions and unconstrained vectors to the Lagrangian local orthotropic coordinate system at each integration point. Using the orthotropic axis definition, we write the initial nodal positions as(24){X¯1X¯2X¯3}=[r11r21r31r12r22r32r13r23r33]{X1X2X3}This equation can be extended to other variables that are susceptible to rotation, such as the current positions, initial directors and current unconstrained vectors, as(25)X¯=Rt⋅X(26)Y¯=Rt⋅Y(27)N¯=Rt⋅N(28)G¯=Rt⋅GThe linear rate of thickness variationT¯ℓis not susceptible to rotation and is invariant regarding the adopted coordinate system. With the positions and vectors given in the local coordinates, all of the expressions in Sections 2 and 3 are valid and, when employed, result inA¯andE¯following the local coordinates. In the next section, we show how to apply the enhancement of the basic strainE¯to generate the enhanced valueE¯¯that will be employed in the solution.By following the steps described in Sections 2 and 3 and introducing the enhanced strain valueE¯¯intoE¯, we calculateS¯,∂E¯/∂Y¯,F¯int=∂θ/∂Y¯andH¯=∂2θ/(∂Y¯∂Y¯), which are the second Piola−Kirchhoff stress, the derivative of the Green strain in the local coordinates, the local internal force and the Hessian matrix, respectively, at each integration point.The integration point contributions of the internal forceF¯intand the Hessian matrixH¯are rotated to the global system of coordinates as(29)Fint=R⋅F¯intand(30)H=R⋅H¯⋅RtThese values are assembled in the global solution process as described in Section 2. It is important to note that this rotation is not applied to the energy conjugate of the linear rate of thickness variationT¯ℓ.This section presents the main part of the proposed formulation, which is an original strategy to guaranty a continuous stress distribution through the thickness of orthotropic laminated plates and shells for position-based Finite Elements. The enhancement is applied to the basic Green strainE¯and its derivative with respect to nodal positions by multiplying them (in the local coordinate system) by the proposed enhancement mode as follows:(31)E¯¯=[E¯11E¯12E¯13.Γ1E¯12E¯22E¯23.Γ2E¯13.Γ1E¯23.Γ2E¯33.Γ3](32)∂E¯¯/∂Y¯=[∂E¯11/∂Y¯∂E¯12/∂Y¯∂E¯13/∂Y¯.Γ1∂E¯12/∂Y¯∂E¯22/∂Y¯∂E¯23/∂Y¯.Γ2∂E¯13/∂Y¯.Γ1∂E¯23/∂Y¯.Γ2∂E¯33/∂Y¯.Γ3]whereE¯and∂E¯/∂Y¯are determined from the basic kinematics, andΓiare derived from the pure kinematics.The transverse shear enhancement mode is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium such that no changes occur in the strain energy that is calculated along a vertical line for pure Reissner−Mindlin (constant transverse strain) kinematics. Three enhancement modes are developed: two shear modes for orthotropic planes 1 and 2 (Γ1andΓ2) and one for the thickness longitudinal strain (Γ3).The shear strain components are enhanced by(33)E¯¯13(zlam)=Γ1(zlam).E¯13(34)E¯¯23(zlam)=Γ2(zlam).E¯23whereE¯13andE¯23are directly calculated from the basic kinematics (Eqs. (21), (23), (16) and (18)) using the detailed expressions given by [7,8,22]. The coordinatezlam=(h0lam/2)ξ3follows the third orthotropic direction centered in a generic lamina (Fig. 2).Considering that the modesΓ1andΓ2are enhancement fields that could be independent of the studied problem, without loss of generality, we consider small strains, i.e., Green−Lagrange strain approaches the linear strain measure, and the Piola−Kirchhoff stress approaches the Cauchy stress.Through the constitutive equations, the shear strain components that develop in the third orthotropic direction (orthogonal to the reference surface) generate the shear stresses that result in the shear forcesq13andq23per unit length. The equilibrium equations for these shear forces are written as(35)q13=q13fl+q13vol=∂m1∂x1+∂m21∂x2(36)q23=q23fl+q23vol=∂m2∂x2+∂m12∂x1wheremadis the torsion moment in planeawith shear stresses that develop in theddirection, andmdis the bending moment that develops normal stresses in theddirection. The indicesaanddhave values of 1 and 2 that correspond to the in-plane orthotropic directions. Moreover, the superscriptsflandvolrepresent bending and torsion, respectively.As discussed previously, the energy compatibility is such that no change occurs for the pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics (Eqs. (21) and (22);T¯ℓ=0). The energy equivalence should be performed separately for bending and torsion. For bending, the energy equivalence is written (without implicit summation) as(37)12qd3fl.E¯d3cte−fl=∫h12E¯¯d3flS¯d3fldzThe strain energy that develops from the shear force that is associated with the constant strain (pure Reissner−Mindlin) should be equal to the strain energy that develops from the energetically equivalent strain field (E¯¯d3fl) that respects the continuous shear stress distribution (S¯d3fl).By stress symmetry (Cauchy theorem), this stress distribution is compatible with the in-plane normal stress equilibrium that develops from the bending moments:(38)S¯d3lam−fl=qd3flIz(d)Mlam(d)(zlam)with(39)Izd=∑k=1m{Edkhk3/12+Edk.hk.ek2}(40)ek=dk−z¯cgd-fl(41)z¯cgd-fl=∑k=1m{Edk.hk.dk}∑k=1m{Edk.hk}(42)Mlam(d)(zlam)=({∑i=mlam+1E(d)i.ei}+E(d)lam.{(hlam2−zlam).elam+12((hlam2)2−zlam2)})whereEdkis Young׳s modulus of each lamina ‘k’ in the directiond,z¯cgd-flis the corresponding elastic center that is related to the reference surface,hkis the height of each lamina,Mlam(d)(zlam)is the static momentum per unit length (with respect to the shell׳s elastic center), which is calculated as a function ofzlamwith the origin in the lamina׳s center of gravity, andmrepresents the total number of laminas. The summation∑i=mlam+1is performed on decreasing values from the maximum number of laminas (m) to the upper neighbor of the considered lamina (lam).From the continuous stress distribution (38) and the elastic shear modulusGd3lam, we can write:(43)E¯¯d3lam−fl=S¯d3lam−fl2Gd3lamwhereGd3lamis the elastic shear modulus that relates directiondand direction 3. Substituting Eq. (43) into Eq. (37) and integrating gives:(44)qd3fl=(Iz)2∑k=1m12Gd3k∫−hk/2hk/2(Ms(d)(zk))2dzE¯d3cte−flSubstituting Eq. (44) into Eq.

(45) and is compatible with bending∂md/∂x(d). AlthoughΓdlam−flhas been derived from the pure kinematics, it will be imposed on the basic kinematics; see Eqs. (31) and (32).The previously described procedure that considered the equilibrium of the longitudinal stresses related to bending is repeated for the torsional shear force:(49)12qd3vol.E¯d3cte/vol=∫h12E¯¯d3volS¯d3voldzUsing the torsion version of Eq.

AlthoughΓadlam−volwas derived from the pure kinematics, it will be imposed on the basic kinematics; see Eqs. (31) and (32).Each enhancement mode was developed to maintain the original value of the strain energy function that is associated with the corresponding internal shear force fragment (Eqs. (35) and (36)). It is now necessary to compose both modes together. This composition can be expressed as(56)Γ1=1k1+ℓ21(k1.Γ1lam−fl+ℓ21.Γ21lam−vol)(57)Γ2=1k2+ℓ12(k2.Γ2lam−fl+ℓ12.Γ12lam−vol)wherekd/(kd+ℓad)is a constant that represents the flexural shear force contribution, andℓad/(kd+ℓad)is the torsional shear force contribution.These values can be calculated from Eqs. (35) and (36):(58)kd(kd+ℓad)=∂md∂x(d)(59)ℓad(kd+ℓad)=∂mad∂x(a)However, the modesΓdlam−flandΓadlam−volare very similar; therefore, a simpler way to calculate their influence is employed in this study. For each integration point, we setkd=E¯d(d)(original longitudinal strain) andℓad=E¯ad(original in-plane shear strain), whereaanddassume the values 1 and 2.Finally, instead of applying the enhancements (56) and (57) over the pure kinematics as represented by Eqs. (47) and (50), we apply them to Eqs. (33) and (34) (or 31) and (32); that is, over the basic kinematic strain. Therefore, a slight change of strain energy is expected but is restricted to the enhancement term, which is the rate of thickness variation.The intensity of the normal stress in the transverse direction of the shell is usually small; therefore, it is acceptable to consider a constant normal stressσc. The strain energy per unit length that develops in the third orthotropic direction due to this constant normal stress is calculated as(60)Ue=12∫−h/2h/2σ33.E¯33ctedz=12σc.E¯33cte∑k=1mhkwhereE¯33cteis the constant strain calculated from the pure kinematics (Eqs. (21) and (22)). To obtain the initial strain distribution, we neglect Poisson׳s ratio, which gives:(61)E¯¯33(zk)=σc/E33(zk)whereE33(zk)is Young׳s modulus in the third orthotropic direction. The related strain energy per unit length that develops from this strain distribution is(62)Ue=12∫−h/2h/2E¯¯33(zk).σcdz=12σc2∑k=1mhkE33kCombining Eqs. (62) and (60) results in(63)σc=∑k=1mhk∑k=1mhkE33kE¯33cteIf a Poisson׳s ratio of zero is adopted, the improved strain field is given by(64)E¯¯33(zlam)=Γlam(zlam).E¯33ctewith(65)Γlam(zlam)=1E33lam∑k=1mhk∑k=1mhkE33kE¯33cteHowever, by using the complete constitutive relation instead of neglecting Poisson׳s ratio, the enhancement mode becomes:(66)Γ3=Γlam(zlam)=AC1E33lam∑i=1mhi∑i=1mhi/E33ii−BCwhere(67)A=1−ν12ν23ν31−ν13ν21ν32−ν12ν21−ν13ν31−ν23ν32(68)B=[(ν23+ν13ν21)E¯22+(ν13+ν23ν12)E¯11]/E¯33(69)C=1−ν12ν21Eq. (66) multipliesE¯33and∂E¯33/∂Y¯from Eqs. (31) and (32) to complete the enhancement procedure. The value of B is calculated as(70)B=[(ν23+ν13ν21)∂E¯22/∂Y¯+(ν13+ν23ν12)∂E¯11/∂Y¯]Y¯/(∂E¯33/∂Y¯)when it is used with Eq. (32).It is important to note that the enhancement modes (Eqs. (56), (57) and (66)) are calculated using the pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics; however, they are applied to the so-called basic kinematic strains (Eqs. (31) and (32)), for whichT¯ℓ≠0. Therefore, a slight change of the strain energy is expected but is restricted to the enhancement term; i.e., the rate of thickness variation. The final transverse normal stress will not be constant but will be continuous.The second part of this study is the development of an alternative orthotropic multi-linear 3D elastoplastic constitutive relation. The differences between this formulation and typical ones are the plastic flow independence of any plastic potential and the dependence of hardening on the orthotropic directions. This allows the imposition of the volume change in the plastic phase, including the usual isochoric situation. The proposed elastoplastic formulation is based on the bilinear isotropic elastoplastic model proposed by [36]. To simplify the notation, the upper bar, which is related to the local coordinate orientation, is omitted.We consider small or moderate strains because these applications are typically associated with common structural materials, such as steel and concrete. Therefore, the Green strain approaches the linear strain, and we assume the additive decomposition of strain:(71)E=Ee+EpwhereEeandEpare the elastic and plastic parts ofE, respectively. It is important to note thatEp=0andE=Eefor elastic situations. Therefore, the complete free energy potential, including the strain energy, is written as(72)θ(E−Ep,α)=12Ee:ℭ:Ee+12α⋅H⋅αwhere the first part reproduces the elastic model, andHis a second-order tensor with hardening parameters.The static variables defined by [32] come from Eq. (72) as(73)S=∂θ∂E=ℭ:Ee=ℭ:(E−Ep)(74)χ=−∂θ∂α=−H⋅αwhereχis the thermodynamic internal force.Because the stress in Eq. (73) depends on the value ofE, it is necessary to relateEandα. This is usually done by creating a plastic potentialF(S,χ)[32] in whichχ,αandHare considered scalars. Based on this plastic potential:(75)Ėp=λ̇∂F∂S(76)α̇=λ̇∂F∂χwhereλis the plastic multiplier. Eqs. (75) and (76) show thatĖpandα̇are related by solving the plastic multiplier. The plastic multiplier satisfies the following Khun−Tucker relations:(77)λ̇≥0,f≤0,λ̇f=0wheref(S,χ)is the yielding function,(78)f=S:P:S+L:S−χ−Syin whichPis the fourth-order tensor that defines the stress behavior at Nadai’s plane,Lis the second-order tensor that defines the influence of the hydrostatic stress on the model, andSyis the initial size of the surface or the equivalent failure stress level. The strategy used to calculateP,LandSyfrom simple uniaxial parameters is described in Appendix A. As mentioned previously, in expression (78),χis assumed to be a scalar and results in scalar values forαandHin Eqs. (76) and (74). It is worth noting that the hardening parameterHwill be divided into volumetric and isochoric parts. Moreover, we present a simple strategy to consider different hardenings depending on the stress evolution and orthotropic directions in Appendix A.Generalizing what is proposed by [36], instead of using a known plastic potential, we control Eqs. (75) and (76) by writing:(79)∂F∂S=η=Dp:S⇒Ėp=λ̇ηand(80)∂F∂χ=−1⇒λ̇=−α̇in which(81)Dp=(ℭp)−1whereℭpis a typical plastic fourth-order tensor that is similar toℭless the plastic Poisson ratio. For isotropic analysis, isochoric plasticity is recovered ifνp=0.5, and the plastic flow follows the elastic flow direction ifν=νp. It is important to note that as far as the authors knowledge goes, this method of formulating elastoplasticity has not been used in any finite element shell or plate formulation and is presented here together with the positional finite element enhanced kinematics for the first time.From the basic definitions shown above and consideringHto be constant by parts, one can find closed expressions for the evolution of the internal variables. We start by assuming a typical step[tn,tn+1]and adopting an elastic trial, which is represented by an upper bar,E¯(n+1)→Total trial strainE¯(n+1)p=Enp→Accumulated plastic strain trialλ¯(n+1)=λn=−αn→Accumulated internal variable trialχ¯(n+1)=χn→Accumulated thermodynamic force trialUsing these variables, we calculate the stress level,(82)S(n+1)=ℭ:(E(n+1)t−Enpt−ΔEp)=S¯(n+1)−ℭ:ΔEp=S¯(n+1)−ΔSpfor which the trial stressS¯is known.Using this trial stress, we calculate the trial yielding function,(83)f¯(n+1)=S¯:P:S¯+L:S¯−χ¯−SyIff¯(n+1)≤0, then the step is elastic, and the trial variables are the real ones. However, iff¯(n+1)>0, the step is elastoplastic, andf(n+1)should be forced to be zero. This case is solved here in a closed form becauseHis considered constant by parts.To do so, several previous definitions that were used for rates are now used for evolution variables, and several new definitions are presented:(84)ΔEp=Δλη(85)η=Dp:S¯(86)ΔSp=ℭ:ΔEp=Δλℭ:η(87)Δεeqpd=ΔEp:P:ΔEp=ΔλDp:S¯:P:Dp:S¯=Δλη:P:η(88)Δεeqpv=L:ΔEp=ΔλL:Dp:S¯=ΔλL:η(89)Δεeqp=Δεeqpd+Δεeqpvwhere the new variablesΔεeqp,ΔεeqpdandΔεeqpvΔεeqpvare the total, distortional and volumetric equivalent strains, respectively. These equivalent strains are written in the same metric as the equivalent stresses, i.e., the stress parts of the yielding function. Therefore, the evolution of the internal thermodynamic force is given by(90)Δχ=HdΔεeqpd+HvΔεeqpv=Δλ(Hdη:P:η+HvL:η)=ΔλbWe forcef(n+1)to zero by using Eq. (82) in Eq. (83) as(91)f(n+1)=(S¯(n+1)−ΔSp):P:(S¯(n+1)−ΔSp)+L:(S¯(n+1)−ΔSp)−(χ¯+Δχ)−Sy=0Using Eqs. (84)–(90), Eq. (91) becomes:(92)d−(e+o)Δλ+gΔλ2=cΔλ−f¯0in which:(93)a=L:ℭ:ηandb=Hdη:P:η+HvL:η(94)d=S¯:P:S¯(95)c=a+b(96)g=ℭ:η:P:ℭ:η(97)e=S¯:P:ℭ:η(98)o=ℭ:η:P:S¯(99)f¯0=L:S¯−χ¯−SySquaring Eq. (92) and solving gives:(100)Δλ=−β±β2−4ξγ2ξwhereξ=g−c2,β=2cf¯0−e−oandγ=d−(f¯0)2. The correct value for the solution is the smaller positiveΔλ. UsingΔλin Eq. (84), updatingE(n+1)p=E(n+1)p+ΔEpand applying Eq. (73) results in the real stress level. This stress is applied in Eq. (6) as part of the Newton−Raphson solution process.In Section 2, the Newton−Raphson procedure is used to solve the equilibrium, and the elastoplastic tangent tensor is required to improve the convergence rate. To determine this tensor, we use the fact that the variation of the yielding function is null (ḟ=0) during the plastic evolution; therefore:(101)ḟ=f,S:Ṡ+f,λλ̇=0From previous equations, we get:(102)f,S=[(P:S+S:P)2S:P:S+L](103)f,λλ̇=−χ,λλ̇=−χ̇=−(Hd+Hv)λ̇Using Eqs. (73), (79) and (103) in (101) results in(104)λ̇=f,S:ℭ(f,S:ℭ:η+Hd+Hv):ĖApplying Eqs. (73) and (79) again,Ṡ=ℭ:(Ė−Ėp)=ℭ:(Ė−ηλ̇), so(105)Ṡ=[ℭ−ℭ:η:f,S:ℭ(f,S:ℭ:η+Hd+Hv)]:Ė=ℭtan:Ė=∂2θ∂E∂E:ĖBecause the tangent stiffness tensor is used to improve the convergence of the Newton−Raphson procedure, it is interesting to adopt a symmetric version of it substitutingf,S, given in Eq. (102), byηor only considering only its diagonal.Five examples are shown to validate the enhanced kinematics and the proposed elastoplastic formulation.Although the present formulation was developed for elastoplastic analysis, it is important to validate the elastic stress distribution by comparing the calculated values with existing benchmarks. This example is used to show that the proposed enhancement is capable of modeling the displacements and stresses of moderately thick laminated plates and provides stress distributions that are consistent with those determined by analytical solutions.The structure is a simply-supported square plate that is subjected to a uniform load and consists of three layers that are symmetrical with respect to the middle surface (Fig. 4). The length to thickness ratio isa/h=10, so the structure may be considered thick [21]. The ratio R of the elastic properties of the face sheets to those of core is varied from 5 to 100 to compare the displacements. Fig. 4 shows the geometry adopted by [34] to solve this problem analytically. The core (reference) elastic properties areE1=0.93548,E2=0.491129,E3=0.530056,ν12=0.35,ν13=ν23=0,G12=0.262931,G13=0.159914andG23=0.266810. To guarantee small displacements and strains, the load is chosen asq=1.0×10−5. The adopted mesh (sufficient to achieve displacement convergence) uses a total of 512 16×16 triangular regular cubic elements, 2401 nodes and 16,208 degrees of freedom.Fig. 5 shows the transverse displacements (w/qh) at the center of the plate calculated using our basic and enhanced kinematics. These displacements are compared to the rotation−displacement-based Layerwise Theory (LWT) and Third Order Theory (TOT) presented by [21]. The analytical 3D solution and the analytical thin-plate theory solution from [34] are also plotted in Fig. 5. The displacements that were calculated using our basic kinematics approach those from the thin plate analytical solution, while the displacements calculated using our enhanced kinematics approach those from the LWT and analytical solutions for the tested thick plate.Fig. 6 compares the shear stress (σ13/q) distributions calculated using the basic kinematics and the enhanced kinematics (forR=5) to the analytical solutions for solid and thin plates given by [34]. The shear stresses are calculated at the center of the simply-supported side, and the normal stresses are calculated at the center of the plate.Tables 1 and 2 compare the longitudinal stress distributions (σ11/q) and (σ22/q) of our formulation (enhanced case) to those presented by [34] for R=5.It is interesting to note that for the analysis of this thick plate, the proposed formulation gives better displacement results than the TOT and gives a similar response to the LWT. The proposed formulation can regularize the shear stresses and gives good results whenR=5anda/h=10. However, ifRis increased fora/h=10ora/his decreased (the plate is thick) for any value ofR, the proposed formulation cannot accurately reproduce stresses, but it gives good displacement results. For large values ofa/h(thin plates), the ratioRcan be raised and the stresses and displacements are well represented; see the Example 7.2.To be complete,Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the shear stress componentsσ12/q(naturally discontinuous),σ13/q(continuous) andσ23/q(continuous), respectively, at the supported corner of the plate. Two coordinates are chosen: point A(0.04167,0.02083)and point B(0.02083,0.04167). No comparisons are presented for these points because the references do not show these results.As expected, the values ofσ13Aandσ23Bare similar, but they are not equal because the material is orthotropic. The same results occur forσ23Aandσ13Band forσ12Aandσ12B. For an isotropic case, such asE3=E2=E1=0.93548,ν13=ν23=ν12=0.35, andG13=G23=G12=0.262931,σ13A=σ23B,σ23A=σ13Bandσ12A=σ12Bhold at the corner.Table 6 shows these values.A laminated simply-supported square plate (with sidesa=400cm) under a uniformly distributed load (q=−1.0kN/m2) is analyzed. The plate is composed of an isotropic core material in the center withhc=10cm,Ec=2GPa,νc=0.25and two identical orthotropic (symmetric) face sheets withhs=2cm,E11=100GPa,E22=2GPa,E33=5GPa,G12=1.0GPa,G13=2.5GPa,G23=1.0GPaandν12=0.25. We assume two cases that differ in their values of the Poisson ratio in the transverse direction,ν13=ν23=0.0andν13=ν23=0.25, for all laminas. It is important to note that in both cases, the shear modulus (in any direction) for the core is constant atG=0.8GPa. The plate is considered to be moderately thin becausea/h≅30.Only one-quarter of the problem was discretized by a 16×16 regular mesh (512 cubic triangular elements and 2401 nodes) for the transverse displacementν13=ν23=0.25(Fig. 7).Table 7 shows the central displacements for both cases,Table 8 shows the normal stresses versus vertical position at the center of the plate for both cases, andTable 9 shows the shear stresses. The stresses are calculated at (95.833cm, 91.667cm) with symmetry at the origin.All of the transverse stresses have been regularized, and as expected the difference between the results forν13=ν23=0.0andν13=ν23=0.25is very low.To show that the proposed formulation is able to solve thin and very thin shell problems without focusing on stress calculations, we calculate the central deflection of a square simply-supported plate with sidesa=10mthat is subjected to a uniformly distributed loadq. The heighthis varied from1.0mto1.0cm; that is,1/10≥(h/L)≥1/1000. The plate is considered to be isotropic withE=210GPaandν=0.3, and the same mesh (16×16 elements) is adopted.The applied distributed load is calibrated such that the central displacement that is calculated by the Navier series solution for Kirchhoff׳s plate theory remains constant and equal toδ=1.0mm, which represents small displacements.As is well known, Kirchhoff׳s plate theory uses the plane stress assumption, which does not occur in real applications. Because of this simplification, Kirchhoff׳s plate theory gives larger displacements than the corresponding real plate situation for thin and very thin plates. This occurs because only the first of the following 6 strain compatibility equations is respected; the others are disregarded by Kirchhoff׳s plate theory.(a)∂2ε11∂x2∂x2+∂2ε22∂x1∂x1=2∂2ε12∂x2∂x1,(b)∂2ε11∂x3∂x3+∂2ε33∂x1∂x1=2∂2ε13∂x3∂x1(c)∂2ε22∂x3∂x3+∂2ε33∂x2∂x2=2∂2ε23∂x3∂x2,(d)∂2ε11∂x2∂x3+∂2ε23∂x1∂x1=∂2ε13∂x2∂x1+∂2ε12∂x3∂x1(e)∂2ε22∂x1∂x3+∂2ε13∂x2∂x2=∂2ε23∂x2∂x1+∂2ε12∂x3∂x2,(f)∂2ε33∂x2∂x1+∂2ε12∂x3∂x3=∂2ε23∂x3∂x1+∂2ε13∂x3∂x2Therefore, our displacement solution is expected to assume a constant value for the central deflection (no locking) but be smaller than the solution from Kirchhoff׳s plate theory. For this example, it is possible to show the existence of this incompatible strain field in Kirchhoff׳s plate theory by relaxing the transverse elastic modulus of our orthotropic solution using the empirical formulaE33=40000(h/L)4.30103.Table 10 shows theh/Lratio, the applied loadq, the central deflectionwkfrom Kirchhoff׳s plate theory, the central deflectionwuvfrom the proposed formulation and the numerical result from relaxing the transverse elastic modulus by the empirical formulawrelpresented above.Table 10 shows that the solution of our formulation for thin and very thin plates is, for this case of0.95mm, i.e.,5%less than the solution from Kirchhoff׳s plate theory. This gives a more flexible result than the real result, and our solution is nearly constant forh/L<1/100; i.e., no locking occurs. Moreover, the last column confirms that the five strain compatibility equations are disregarded by Kirchhoff׳s plate theory; by decreasing the transverse elastic modulus, we relax these compatibility equations.It is important to note that when our results are larger than those of Kirchhoff׳s plate theory, the influence of the shear strain becomes important and introduces more flexibility to the plate. As discussed previously, our solution does not change when we useν13=ν31=ν23=ν32=0for thin shells (h/L<1/100); that is, no volumetric locking occurs.To illustrate the behavior of the constitutive model, a square orthotropic plate with sidesℓ=100cmand thicknesst=10cmis stretched by a distributed in-plane load as shown inFig. 8a. The orthotropic direction is indicated by the arbitrary angleθ. The adopted discretization is depicted in Fig. 8b.Fig. 9 shows the uniaxial stress−strain diagrams from which the elastoplastic constitutive model is constructed following the strategy that is proposed in Appendix A. It is important to note that the third orthotropic direction is equal to the second; moreover, the uniaxial stress−strain diagrams are equal in tension and compression.Figs. 10 and 11 show the stress-strain evolution (at the central line) for a loadqthat varies from zero to0.8kN/cm2and forθvarying from zero to90°for Poisson ratios ofν=0.0andν=0.2, respectively.In Figs. 10 and 11, the uniaxial values of Fig. 9 are used as reference values. The results illustrate the good behavior of the adopted model for extreme situations and the coherent results for intermediate cases, such as the dependence of hardening on the orthotropic direction.Fig. 12 shows the horizontal displacements forν=0.0andν=0.2withθ=45°.A short laminated clamped beam (Fig. 13) is analyzed using three different approaches with the same computational code. The first approach considers the beam as a solid, and its width is modeled by the thickness of our shell finite element; seeFig. 14 for the resulting discretization. The second approach considers the short beam as a plate following the basic kinematics; the shear stressσ13is discontinuous. The third approach is similar to the second, but the shear stressσ13is made continuous by the imposition of the enhancement that was proposed in Section 5.Fig. 15 shows the discretization that was used for the second and third approaches.In this example, isotropic laminas are used to facilitate interpretation. The upper and lower sheets are composed of steel withE=200GPa,ν=0.0, andσ¯t=σ¯c=400MPafor which the yield surface degenerates into the von-Mises surface. The core is composed of concrete withE=20GPa,ν=0.0,σ¯t=4MPaandσ¯c=40MPa; in this case, the yield surface degenerates into the Drucker−Prager surface. Perfect plasticity is employed.The distributed load is applied to the transverse shell in equal increments ofΔq=0.26MPauntil failure. For the solid arrangement, the load is applied tangentially asΔq=0.025MPa.Fig. 16 shows the load/displacement curve. The displacement is measured at the free end of the beam, and the total load is used as a reference.Fig. 17 shows a qualitative view of the material degradation (equivalent plastic strain) at the failure load for the solid representation of the beam.The results show that while the proposed enhancement is able to perfectly characterize the failure load, the basic kinematics predicts a load that is 5.5 times greater than the expected one. The results reveal the importance of a good approximation for the shear stresses when developing plate and shell finite element formulations. Moreover, the results verify the excellent behavior of the proposed strain enhancement. To be complete,Fig. 18 shows the shear stress distribution (at the second load level) for both shell kinematics in the transverse direction at a distance0.833cmfrom the clamped end. The concrete shear stress is under-predicted by the basic kinematics, which prevents collapse from occurring at the proper load.Fig. 19 shows the shear stress distribution obtained at the second load level using the solid approach. The shear stress is consistent with that predicted by the proposed enhanced strain model. A small shear stress concentration appears in the steel and is not captured by the enhanced formulation. However, this concentration is small and does not change the overall behavior of the analysis.In addition to validating the proposed enhancement for use in the analysis of bending laminated plates and shells, this example also reveals the good behavior of our formulation when working in the membrane direction (Fig. 9).The developed formulation is used to solve the pinching of an elastoplastic cylindrical shell. The elastic formulation has been tested for large deformations [8,22] and compared with benchmarks developed by [35] and [18]. The analyzed cylindrical shell is composed of an aluminum sheet with a thickness oft=0.33mm, radius ofR=30.1mmand length ofl=115.2mm. The aluminum has an elasticity modulusE=69GPa, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.33and yielding stress ofσy=207MPa. The elastoplastic behavior is considered to be multi-linear isotropic and can be extracted from the one-dimensional stress-strain diagram shown inFig. 20.To run this example, one-eighth of the cylinder is discretized by a 24×30 mesh with 6643 nodes (Fig. 21a). The applied load and the complete geometry are depicted in Fig. 21b. Because the load is concentrated, a small region of the mesh (3×4 elements) is considered to be perfectly elastic to avoid plastic localization.The position is controlled using 19 steps of1.5mm.Fig. 22 compares the calculated elastoplastic equilibrium path to the elastic result. The elastoplastic case is more flexible than the elastic case before the displacement reaches one-third of the cylinder׳s radius. However, due to the differences in the geometric configurations, the elastoplastic case shows a stiffer behavior than the elastic case along a considerable displacement interval. The elastic case shows geometrical softening after the critical displacement of10.5mm.Fig. 23 shows the positions of the elastoplastic and elastic cases for the imposed displacement of15mmunder the applied load.To clarify the difference in the positions and to justify the stiffer behavior of the elastoplastic case,Fig. 24 shows a superposition of the elastically deformed mesh from Fig. 23b and the elastoplastic displacement isocurves from Fig. 23a. The elastic positions form a nearly horizontal plateau, while the elastoplastic positions form an inclined pattern. This means that the membrane׳s stiffness is more pronounced in the elastoplastic solution, which causes the observed stiffer behavior.Fig. 25 shows the qualitative plastic strains that develop at various levels of the applied load on the inner surface of the shell.InFig. 26, the range of plastic strain is changed to illustrate the parts of the shell that have passed through yielding at different displacements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper presented a positional FEM formulation with a regularized stress distribution in the transverse direction that was applied to the analysis of elastoplastic thin and moderately thick laminated plates and shells. In addition, a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material was developed to include orthotropic elastoplastic 3D materials. The proposed methodology that uses the enhanced kinematics to achieve a continuous transverse stress provides very good results and does not increase the number of degrees of freedom. The strain enhancement modes are based on equilibrium equations, energy conservation and constitutive relations. The proposed formulation is capable of accurately reproducing the transverse displacements, and no locking was detected for moderately thick and thin plates. The developed enhancement modes proved to be effective and give almost identical values to the tested shear stress distributions of thin and moderately thick plates. The proposed elastoplastic model works properly and can be used for general applications. Moreover, the failure predictions for laminated structural members are consistent with those predicted by solid models.
