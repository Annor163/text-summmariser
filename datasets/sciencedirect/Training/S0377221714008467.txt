@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article presents a goal programming framework to solve group decision making problems where decision-makers’ judgments are provided as incomplete interval additive reciprocal comparison matrices (IARCMs). New properties of multiplicative consistent IARCMs are put forward and used to define consistent incomplete IARCMs. A two-step goal programming method is developed to estimate missing values for an incomplete IARCM. The first step minimizes the inconsistency of the completed IARCMs and controls uncertainty ratios of the estimated judgments within an acceptable threshold, and the second step finds the most appropriate estimated missing values among the optimal solutions obtained from the previous step. A weighted geometric mean approach is proposed to aggregate individual IARCMs into a group IARCM by employing the lower bounds of the interval additive reciprocal judgments. A two-step procedure consisting of two goal programming models is established to derive interval weights from the group IARCM. The first model is devised to minimize the absolute difference between the logarithm of the group preference and that of the constructed multiplicative consistent judgment. The second model is developed to generate an interval-valued priority vector by maximizing the uncertainty ratio of the constructed consistent IARCM and incorporating the optimal objective value of the first model as a constraint. Two numerical examples are furnished to demonstrate validity and applicability of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The pairwise comparison method and hierarchy analysis technology have been widely used to decompose a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) into a series of more tractable and simpler sub-problems. In a conventional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980), a decision problem is structured as a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives, and a multiplicative reciprocal comparison matrix is employed to express a decision-maker's pairwise comparison results, where the judgments are provided as crisp values. However, in many real-life decision problems, a decision-maker's judgments may contain vagueness and uncertainty and, hence, cannot be represented as crisp data (Dubois & Prade, 2012; Durbach & Stewart, 2012; Entani & Sugihara, 2012; Guo & Tanaka, 2010; Saaty & Vargas, 1987; Wan & Li, 2013; Xia & Chen, 2015; Xu & Chen, 2008; Zhu & Xu, 2014). As such, other forms of pairwise comparison matrices have been developed to deal with imprecise and uncertain judgment information, such as interval multiplicative reciprocal comparison matrices (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and interval additive reciprocal comparison matrices (IARCM) (also called interval fuzzy preference relations (Xu & Chen, 2008)).In a complete n × n comparison matrix, all judgment values are known. Given the reciprocity of a comparison matrix, it implies that the decision-maker should provide either the upper or lower diagonal n(n − 1)/2 elements on a level with n alternatives or criteria. In reality, the decision-maker is sometimes unable or unwilling to provide his/her opinions over some alternatives due to insufficient information or limited expertise, especially in face of a large number of criteria or alternatives. In this situation, an incomplete comparison matrix is resulted (Alonso, Chiclana, Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, Alcal-Fdez, & Porcel, 2008; Alonso, Herrera-Viedma, Chiclana, & Herrera, 2010; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, & Alonso, 2009; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, & Herrera, 2008; Fedrizzi & Giove, 2007; Gong, 2008; Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera, 2007; Liu, Zhang, & Wang, 2012; Liu, Pan, Xu, & Yu, 2012; Xu, 2004, 2012; Xu, Li, & Wang, 2014). MCDM with incomplete comparison matrices have been receiving increasing attention and many different methods have been developed to estimate missing or unknown values for incomplete additive reciprocal comparison matrices (Alonso et al., 2008, 2010; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, & Alonso, 2009; Gong, 2008; Herrera-Viedma et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Xu, 2004). For instance, Xu (2004) introduced the concept of incomplete additive reciprocal comparison matrices (or referred to as incomplete fuzzy preference relations), and proposed two goal programming models for obtaining priority weights of incomplete additive reciprocal comparison matrices from the viewpoints of additive transitivity and multiplicative consistency, respectively. An iterative procedure for estimating missing values was put forward by Herrera-Viedma et al. (2007) and applied to handle group decision making (GDM) problems with incomplete additive reciprocal comparison matrices based on additive transitivity. Liu et al., (2012) put forward a completion method by establishing a least squares model. Based on multiplicative consistency, Alonso et al. (2010) furnished a procedure to estimate missing values and developed a web-based consensus support system for GDM with incomplete additive reciprocal comparison matrices.Genç, Boran, Akay, and Xu (2010) employed the feasible-region-based multiplicative transitivity (Xu & Chen, 2008) to develop two estimation approaches for incomplete IARCMs. Xia and Xu (2011) extended the functional equation proposed by Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, and Herrera (2009) to define perfect multiplicative consistent IARCMs and calculate missing values for incomplete IARCMs. From a multiplicative perspective, an interval additive reciprocal judgment can be transformed to an equivalent interval multiplicative reciprocal judgment (Liu, Zhang, & Zhang, 2014). After the conversion, the uncertainty level of the interval additive reciprocal judgment can be measured by the quotient of the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding interval multiplicative reciprocal judgment. Under this notion, a quotient of 1 indicates a crisp judgment without any uncertainty and the larger the ratio, the more uncertain the interval judgment. For the foresaid estimation methods in Genç et al. (2010) and Xia and Xu (2011), no mechanism is designed to consider the acceptability of the uncertainty levels of the estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments. As such, they sometimes yield highly uncertain estimated values. To obtain rational and reliable decision results, it is crucial to adapt the acceptable uncertainty levels of the estimated values as highly uncertain data contain little useful decision information.In a GDM process, once all individual incomplete comparison matrices are completed and a group comparison matrix is obtained from the completed individual comparison matrices, a critical remaining issue is to derive a priority vector from the group comparison matrix. According to additive or multiplicative transitivity, different prioritization methods have been developed for obtaining an interval-valued priority vector from a complete interval reciprocal comparison matrices such as linear programs (Arbel, 1989; Guo & Wang, 2012; Hu, Ren, Lan, Wang, & Zheng, 2014; Kress, 1991; Wang, Lan, Ren, & Luo, 2012; Xu & Chen, 2008), nonlinear programs (Xia & Xu, 2014), and goal programs (Wang & Elhag, 2007; Wang & Li, 2012; Wang, Yang, & Xu, 2005).Current research reveals that consistency properties are fundamental bases for estimating missing values and generating priority weights for pairwise comparison matrices. When decision-makers’ pairwise comparisons are represented as incomplete IARCMs in a GDM problem, it is important to evaluate missing values first before a group priority vector is derived. Based on the multiplicative consistency concept proposed by Wang and Li (2012), new properties of consistent IARCMs are presented and employed to define multiplicative consistent incomplete IARCMs. A two-step framework consisting of two goal programs is developed to estimate missing values for incomplete IARCMs. The first step aims to estimate missing values such that the resulting complete IARCM possesses either multiplicative consistency or minimal inconsistency, and uncertainty ratios of the estimated values are controlled to be within an acceptable threshold specified by the decision-maker. This is accomplished by minimizing the absolute difference between the two sides of the logarithmic expression of the multiplicative transitivity equation and imposing acceptable uncertainty ratio constraints. The second step is established to find the most appropriate estimated missing values among the optimal solutions obtained from the first model. The modeling idea is that the missing values in an incomplete IARCM reflect the decision-maker's uncertainty about the pairwise comparison. Therefore, by incorporating the optimal solutions in the first model into its constraints, the second model maximizes the uncertainty ratio for the estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments to retain the decision-maker's inherent uncertainty in the original missing values. Subsequently, a weighted geometric mean approach is put forward to aggregate individual preferences into a group IARCM by directly employing the lower bounds of the interval additive reciprocal judgments (upper bounds are indirectly utilized due to reciprocity). It is shown that the group IARCM has multiplicative consistency if all individual IARCMs have multiplicative consistency. Next, a two-step procedure comprising two goal programs is established to derive interval weights from the aggregated group IARCM. By employing a parameterized transformation relation between multiplicative consistent IARCMs and interval weights, the first model minimizes the absolute difference between the logarithm of the group preference and that of the transformed consistent judgment such that the constructed multiplicative consistent IARCMs are the closest to the group IARCM. The second model determines the most appropriate interval-valued priority vector by maximizing the uncertainty ratio of the constructed consistent IARCM and employing the optimal objective value of the first model as a constraint. The optimal interval-valued priority vector derived from the second model is able to be transformed to an IARCM with multiplicative consistency that is closest to that obtained by interval arithmetic and the group IARCM. Finally, by putting the aforesaid models together, an algorithm is proposed for solving GDM problems with incomplete IARCMs.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic concepts related to additive reciprocal comparison matrices and IARCMs. New properties of multiplicative consistent IARCMs and the multiplicative consistency definition of incomplete IARCMs are introduced in Section 3. Section 4 develops two goal programs for estimating missing values in an incomplete IARCM. A goal programming approach is presented for generating an interval-valued priority vector of the group IARCM and a procedure is further put forward to solve GDM problems with incomplete IARCMs in Section 5. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.Let X = {x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of n alternatives, if a pairwise comparison matrix R = (rij)n × non X satisfies(2.1)rij∈[0,1],rij+rji=1,rii=0.5,∀i,j=1,2,…,n,then R = (rij)n × nis called an additive reciprocal comparison matrix (or referred to as an additive reciprocal preference relation (De Baets & De Meyer, 2005; De Baets, De Meyer, & De Loof, 2010)).Element rijin R denotes the [0, 1]-valued preference or importance degree of xiover xj. The larger the value of rij, the smaller the value of rji= 1 − rijand the stronger the preference ratiorijrjiof xioverxj. rij> 0.5 indicates thatrijrji>1and xiis superior to xjwith the preference ratiorijrji. rij< 0.5 shows thatrijrji<1and xiis non-preferred to xjwith the preference ratiorijrji. Especially, if rij= 0.5, thenrijrji=1, implying that xiandxjare equally preferred.Definition 2.1(Tanino, 1984) Let R = (rij)n × nbe an additive reciprocal comparison matrix with 0 < rij< 1, ∀i, j = 1, 2, …, n. If R satisfies the following transitivity condition:(2.2)rikrki=rijrjirjkrkj,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.then R is said to have multiplicative consistency.By the additive reciprocal property of rij+ rji= 1, (2.2) can be equivalently expressed as the following functional equation (Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, & Herrera, 2009):(2.3)rik=rijrjkrijrjk+(1−rij)(1−rjk),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.After examining the property of (2.3), Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, & Alonso (2009) pointed out that the multiplicative consistency by Tanino (1984) is the most appropriate vehicle to model transitivity of additive reciprocal comparison matrices.Due to increasing complexity of many decision problems, it is often hard for decision-makers to provide exact preferences over decision alternatives. To better characterize decision-makers’ vague and uncertain preferences, Xu and Chen (2008) introduced the concept of IARCMs.Definition 2.2(Xu & Chen, 2008) An IARCMR¯on X is denoted by an interval-valued pairwise comparison matrixR¯=(r¯ij)n×nwith the condition:(2.4)r¯ij=[rij−,rij+],0≤rij−≤rij+≤1,rij−+rji+=1,rij++rji−=1,rii−=rii+=0.5,∀i,j=1,2,…,n.wherer¯ijgives an interval preference or importance degree of xiover xj.A multiplicative consistency definition of IARCMs is given by Wang and Li (2012) as follows.Definition 2.3(Wang & Li, 2012) LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe an IARCM with0<rij−≤rij+<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n. IfR¯satisfies multiplicative transitivity:(2.5)r¯ijr¯ji⊗r¯jkr¯kj⊗r¯kir¯ik=r¯ikr¯ki⊗r¯kjr¯jk⊗r¯jir¯ij,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n,where “⊗” and “ − ” indicate the interval multiplication and division operations, respectively, thenR¯is said to have multiplicative consistency.In this section, we first introduce new properties for multiplicative consistent IARCMs and, then employ these properties to define multiplicative consistency for incomplete IARCMs.Based on Definition 2.3, we have the following theorem.Theorem 3.1LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe a complete IARCM with0<rij−≤rij+<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n.R¯has multiplicative consistency if and only if(3.1)rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.First, we prove the sufficiency. As per (3.1), one getsrij−rji+rjk−rkj+rki−rik+=rik−rki+rkj−rjk+rji−rij+andrij+rji−rjk+rkj−rki+rik−=rik+rki−rkj+rjk−rji+rij−. According to interval arithmetic, we haver¯ijr¯ji⊗r¯jkr¯kj⊗r¯kir¯ik=[rij−rji+rjk−rkj+rki−rik+,rij+rji−rjk+rkj−rki+rik−]=[rik−rki+rkj−rjk+rji−rij+,rik+rki−rkj+rjk−rji+rij−]=r¯ikr¯ki⊗r¯kjr¯jk⊗r¯jir¯ij. By Definition 2.3,R¯is an IARCM with multiplicative consistency.Next, we prove the necessary part. As per (2.5) and interval arithmetic, one hasrij−rji+rjk−rkj+rki−rik+=rik−rki+rkj−rjk+rji−rij+∀i, j, k = 1, 2, …, n. Thus, (3.1) holds true.□As (3.1) is equivalent torij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n, the multiplicative consistency can also be called geometric consistency from the viewpoint of the geometric mean of interval endpoints.As per the additive reciprocal property ofrji−=1−rij+andrji+=1−rij−, (3.1) can be equivalently rewritten as any of the following equations:(3.2)rij−rjk−rki−(1−rik−)(1−rkj−)(1−rji−)=rik−rkj−rji−(1−rij−)(1−rjk−)(1−rki−),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.(3.3)rij+rjk+rki+(1−rik+)(1−rkj+)(1−rji+)=rik+rkj+rji+(1−rij+)(1−rjk+)(1−rki+),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.Theorem 3.2LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe a complete IARCM with0<rij−≤rij+<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n, then the following statements are equivalent:(3.4)(i)rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.(ii)rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n,i<j<k.Obviously, if (i) holds, (ii) follows.(ii) ⇒ (i). As per (2.4), we haverii−=rii+=0.5for all i = 1, 2, …, n. Thus, (i) always holds if all or any two of the indices i, j, k are equal.For i ≠ j ≠ k, there exist six possible cases:(1)i < j < k. In this case, (i) is reduced to (ii). Thus, (i) holds.i < k < j. As per (3.4), we haverik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+=rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+. Then,rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+.j < i < k. By (3.4), we obtainrji−rji+rik−rik+rkj−rkj+=rjk−rjk+rki−rki+rij−rij+. Thus,rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+.Similarly, by shuffling the order of the indices i, j, k, (i) holds for the remaining three cases: (4) j < k < i, (5) k < i < j and (6) k < j < i. The proof is thus completed.□As per the reciprocal property ofrji−=1−rij+andrji+=1−rij−, (3.4) can be equivalently expressed as any of the following equations:(3.5)rij−rjk−rki−(1−rik−)(1−rkj−)(1−rji−)=rik−rkj−rji−(1−rij−)(1−rjk−)(1−rki−),∀i<j<k.(3.6)rij+rjk+rki+(1−rik+)(1−rkj+)(1−rji+)=rik+rkj+rji+(1−rij+)(1−rjk+)(1−rki+),∀i<j<k.Based on the aforesaid theorems and analysis, the following corollary can be directly obtained.Corollary 3.1LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe a complete IARCM with0<rij−≤rij+<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n, then the following statements are equivalent:(a)R¯is multiplicative consistent;rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n;rij−rjk−rki−(1−rik−)(1−rkj−)(1−rji−)=rik−rkj−rji−(1−rij−)(1−rjk−)(1−rki−),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n;rij+rjk+rki+(1−rik+)(1−rkj+)(1−rji+)=rik+rkj+rji+(1−rij+)(1−rjk+)(1−rki+),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n;rij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+,∀i<j<k;rij−rjk−rki−(1−rik−)(1−rkj−)(1−rji−)=rik−rkj−rji−(1−rij−)(1−rjk−)(1−rki−),∀i<j<k;rij+rjk+rki+(1−rik+)(1−rkj+)(1−rji+)=rik+rkj+rji+(1−rij+)(1−rjk+)(1−rki+),∀i<j<k.Ifrij−rjk−rki+=rik−rkj+rji+andrij+rjk+rki−=rik+rkj−rji−, thenrij−rij+rjk−rjk+rki−rki+=rik−rik+rkj−rkj+rji−rji+. As per (a) and (e) inCorollary 3.1, the following corollary can be derived.LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe a complete IARCM with0<rij−≤rij+<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n, ifrij−rjk−rki+=rik−rkj+rji+andrij+rjk+rki−=rik+rkj−rji−for all i < j < k, thenR¯has multiplicative consistency.It is worth noting that we cannot remove the constraint i < j < k in Corollary 3.2. Ifrij−rjk−rki+=rik−rkj+rji+andrij+rjk+rki−=rik+rkj−rji−for all i, j, k = 1, 2, …, n, then let k = i, , we haverij−rji−rii+=rii−rij+rji+⇒0.5rij−rji−=0.5rij+rji+⇒rij−rji−=rij+rji+. As per the reciprocal property ofrji−=1−rij+andrji+=1−rij−, one can obtainrij−=rij+for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n. In this case,R¯is only an additive reciprocal comparison matrix. The implication of the restriction i < j < k is that the order of alternative indices matters for this consistency condition.From the viewpoint of pairwise comparison, consistency conditions should be independent of alternative labels. Therefore, it is inappropriate to userij−rjk−rki+=rik−rkj+rji+,rij+rjk+rki−=rik+rkj−rji−,∀i<j<kto define consistent IARCM as the inverse of Corollary 3.2 does not hold.Xia and Xu (2011) extended the functional equation (2.3) to define perfect multiplicative consistent IARCMs. It is easy to prove that the functional equation therein (see Eq. (11) on page 1048 in Xia and Xu (2011)) is equivalent torij−rjk−rki+=rik−rkj+rji+,rij+rjk+rki−=rik+rkj−rji−,∀i<j<k. Therefore, the perfect multiplicative consistency is dependent on alternative labels. One can verify that the perfect multiplicative consistency definition may yield contradictory results for the same pairwise comparisons when alternatives are relabeled in a different order.For a complete IARCMR¯, a decision-maker need provide n(n − 1)/2 upper (or lower) triangular interval additive reciprocal judgments. If the decision-maker is unable or unwilling to furnish his/her judgments over some pairs of alternatives for some reason, an incomplete IARCM is resulted and missing or unknown values may be the lower, upper or both bounds of interval additive reciprocal judgments.Definition 3.1An IARCMR¯is called incomplete if some lower, upper or both bounds of its interval additive reciprocal judgments are not provided by the decision-maker.Note that Definition 3.1 slightly differs from the concept of incomplete IARCMs in Genç et al. (2010), where both the lower and upper bounds of a missing element inR¯are required to be unknown.Due to reciprocity, an IARCMR¯can be determined by n(n − 1) lower or upper bounds of additive reciprocal judgments. Therefore, based on Corollary 3.1, the multiplicative consistency of incomplete IARCMs can be defined as follows by using lower bounds only.Definition 3.2LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe an incomplete IARCM with0<rij−<1,∀(i,j)∈KR¯L, whereKR¯L={(i,j)|i≠j,rij−inR¯isknown}.R¯is multiplicative consistent if there existsr^ij−for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n such that(3.7)r^ij−r^jk−r^ki−(1−r^ik−)(1−r^kj−)(1−r^ji−)=r^ik−r^kj−r^ji−(1−r^ij−)(1−r^jk−)(1−r^ki−),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n(3.8)0<r^ij−<1,r^ij−L≤r^ij−≤r^ij−U,∀i,j=1,2,…,n(3.9)r^ij−+r^ji−≤1,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,(i,j)∉KR¯L,(j,i)∉KR¯Lwherer^ij−Landr^ij−Uare obtained by the following formulae:(3.10)r^ij−L={rij−(i,j)∈KR¯L0.5i=j0(i,j)∉KR¯L,r^ij−U={rij−(i,j)∈KR¯L0.5i=j1−rji−(i,j)∉KR¯L,(j,i)∈KR¯L1(i,j)∉KR¯L,(j,i)∉KR¯LThis section develops goal programming models to estimate missing values for incomplete IARCMs.Eq. (3.2) can be equivalently rewritten as the following logarithmic expression:(4.1)lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)=lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n.Eq. (3.2) or (4.1) holds for multiplicative consistent IARCMs. However, ifR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nis inconsistent, then the elements inR¯do not satisfy (3.2) or (4.1). To estimate missing values in an inconsistent incomplete IARCMR¯, some deviations are allowed by relaxing the relation in (3.2) or (4.1) for all(i,j)∈MVR¯Land k = 1, 2, …, n, k ≠ i, k ≠ j, where(4.2)MVR¯L={(i,j)|i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j}−KR¯LFor an interval additive reciprocal judgmentr¯ij=[rij−,rij+]=[rij−,1−rji−]with0<rij−≤rij+<1, its equivalent interval multiplicative reciprocal judgment is computed as[rij−rji+,rij+rji−]=[rij−1−rij−,1−rji−rji−]whose uncertainty ratio is the quotient of its upper and lower bounds. The larger the uncertainty ratio(1−rji−)rji−(1−rij−)rij−, the more uncertain the interval judgmentr¯ij. It is widely accepted that extremely uncertain judgment information has little or no use in reaching final decision results (Dubois & Prade, 2012; Entani & Sugihara, 2012; Guo & Tanaka, 2010). Therefore, it is sensible to consider acceptable uncertainty levels (as reflected by uncertainty ratios) of the estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments. Presumably, this uncertainty threshold should be solicited from the decision-maker. Based on this modeling idea, the following multiple objective programming models are established to estimate missing values for an incomplete IARCMR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×n.(4.3)minJij=∑k=1k≠i,k≠j.n|lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)−(lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−))|(i,j)∈MVR¯Ls.t.{0<rij−<1,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lrij−+rji−≤1,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L(1−rij−)(1−rji−)rij−rji−≤t.∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lwhere t(t ≥ 1) is an acceptable uncertainty ratio threshold for the estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments, the first line of inequalities ensures that the estimated values are (0, 1)-valued, the next line of constraints requires that the completed valuerij−together with1−rji−constitute an interval additive reciprocal judgment[rij−,1−rji−], i.e.,rij−≤1−rji−, the last group of inequalities guarantees that the estimated interval judgments[rij−,1−rji−]and[rji−,1−rij−]possess acceptable uncertainty ratios, andrij−((i,j)∈MVR¯L) are decision variables, specifying the lower bounds of the missing interval additive reciprocal judgments that are to be estimated.Let(4.4)δijk=lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)−(lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−))(4.5)δijk+=|δijk|+δijk2,δijk−=|δijk|−δijk2.for all(i,j)∈MVR¯Land k = 1, 2, …, n, k ≠ i, k ≠ j.As per (4.4) and (4.5), we haveδijk=δijk+−δijk−,|δijk|=δijk++δijk−andδijk+δijk−=0for all(i,j)∈MVR¯Land k = 1, 2, …, n, k ≠ i, k ≠ j. Consequently, (4.3) is equivalently transformed to the following goal programming model:(4.6)minJ=∑(i,j)∈MVR¯L∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.nαij(δijk++δijk−)s.t.{lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)−(lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−))−δijk++δijk−=0,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j0<rij−<1,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lrij−+rji−≤1,(1−rij−)(1−rji−)≤trij−rji−,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lδijk+≥0,δijk−≥0.∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠jwhere αijis the weight of the objective function Jij((i,j)∈MVR¯L) in (4.3).If all of the aforesaid objective functions are uniformly weighted, one can set αij= 1,((i,j)∈MVR¯L), and (4.6) is rewritten as(4.7)minJ=∑(i,j)∈MVR¯L∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.n(δijk++δijk−)s.t.{lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)−(lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−))−δijk++δijk−=0,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j0<rij−<1,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lrij−+rji−≤1,(1−rij−)(1−rji−)≤trij−rji−,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lδijk+≥0,δijk−≥0.∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠jAlternative optimal solutions may exist for model (4.7) under a particular threshold t. As the missing values are inherently uncertain, it is logical to expect that the corresponding estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments properly reflect this uncertainty. In the context of multiplicative consistency, this uncertainty is captured by the uncertainty ratio, which is effectively contained by the threshold t in (4.7). To eventually estimate missing values, the following nonlinear program is established, which takes the optimal solution to (4.7) as its constraints and maximizes the uncertainty ratios. The aim is to retain the uncertainty inherent in the original missing values without sacrificing the consistency level and acceptable uncertain threshold achieved in (4.7).(4.8)maxJ′=∑(i,j)∈MVR¯L(1−rij−)(1−rji−)rij−rji−s.t.{lnrij−+lnrjk−+lnrki−+ln(1−rik−)+ln(1−rkj−)+ln(1−rji−)−(lnrik−+lnrkj−+lnrji−+ln(1−rij−)+ln(1−rjk−)+ln(1−rki−))−δijk++δijk−=0,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j∑(i,j)∈MVR¯L∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.n(δijk++δijk−)=J*0<rij−<1,rij−+rji−≤1,(1−rij−)(1−rji−)≤t0rij−rji−,∀(i,j)∈MVR¯Lδijk+≥0,δijk−≥0.∀(i,j)∈MVR¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠jwhere J* is the optimal objective value for model (4.7), t0 is the acceptable uncertainty ratio threshold therein, andrij−((i,j)∈MVR¯L) are decision variables.By setting a threshold value t and solving (4.7), we obtain an optimal objective value J*. Solving (4.8) yields its optimal solutionsrij−*((i,j)∈MVR¯L) for the incomplete IARCMR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×n, and a complete IARCM is determined asR¯c=(r¯ijc)n×n=([rij−c,rij+c])n×n, where(4.9)rij−c={rij−(i,j)∈KR¯L0.5i=jrij−*(i,j)∈MVR¯L,rij+c={rij+(j,i)∈KR¯L0.5i=j1−rji−*(j,i)∉KR¯LIt is noted that if the objective value of (4.7) J* = 0 and the incomplete IARCMR¯has multiplicative consistency, then the completed IARCMR¯csatisfies (3.2), implying thatR¯chas multiplicative consistency.Example 1Consider an MCDM problem with a set of four alternatives x1, x2, x3, x4. A decision-maker employs the pairwise comparison method to elicit his/her judgment information and furnishes the following incomplete IARCM.R¯=(r¯ij)4×4=([rij−,rij+])4×4=[[0.5,0.5][2/3,3/4][3/4,6/7][1/2,3/4][1/4,1/3][0.5,0.5][3/5,2/3]−[1/7,1/4][1/3,2/5][0.5,0.5][1/4,1/3][1/4,1/2]−[2/3,3/4][0.5,0.5]]where a “–” denotes a missing value.By Definition 3.2, one can easily verify that the incomplete IARCMR¯has multiplicative consistency.Plugging the incomplete IARCMR¯=(r¯ij)4×4into (4.7) and solving this model under different threshold t values by the optimization modeling software Lingo 11, we obtain their corresponding objective value J* as shown in the last column of Table 1. Subsequently, this information is fed into model (4.8) to estimate the missing interval additive reciprocal judgments[r24−c,r24+c]and[r42−c,r42+c]as shown in Table 1.Next, the estimation methods proposed by Genç et al. (2010) and Xia and Xu (2011) will be used to determine the completed interval additive reciprocal judgments based on the same inputR¯.For a missing elementr¯ij((i,j)∈MVR¯L,(j,i)∈MVR¯L), the estimation method by Genç et al. (2010) firstly identifies possible values of the missing element by a formula (see Eq. (28) in Genç et al., 2010). The formula can be rewritten as per the notation in this article as:(4.10)r¯ij(k)=[rij−(k),rij+(k)]=[rik−rkj−rik−rkj−+(1−rik−)(1−rkj−),rik+rkj+rik+rkj++(1−rik+)(1−rkj+)]where k satisfies(i,k)∉MVR¯L,(k,i)∉MVR¯L,(j,k)∉MVR¯L,(k,j)∉MVR¯L. These possible values are then aggregated by a weighted geometric operator (see Eq. (30) in Genç et al., 2010) to determine the missing element as(4.11)r¯ij=[(∏rij−(k))1/#K,(∏rij+(k))1/#K]where#Kis the number of possible values.By (4.10) and (4.11), one estimates missing interval additive judgments asr¯24=[112,310]=[0.2887,0.5477]andr¯42=[0.4523,0.7113].Xia and Xu (2011) proposed another formula (see Eq. (45) in Xia & Xu, 2011) to estimate missing elements for incomplete IARCMs, which can be expressed by using the notation in this article as:(4.12)r¯ij=[min{ξij,ηij},max{ξij,ηij}],(i,j)∈MVR¯L,(j,i)∈MVR¯Lwhere(4.13)ξij=(∏rik−rkj−)1/#K(∏rik−rkj−)1/#K+(∏(1−rik−)(1−rkj−))1/#K,ηij=(∏rik+rkj+)1/#K(∏rik+rkj+)1/#K+(∏(1−rik+)(1−rkj+))1/#K.As per (4.12), the completed missing values are determined asr¯24=[1/3,0.5]andr¯42=[0.5,2/3].Computation results indicate that the completed values obtained from the three different approaches are overall consistent. For this particular incomplete IARCMR¯, the completed interval additive judgments obtained based on the method in Xia and Xu (2011) are identical to the results derived from the method here by setting t = 2 and Genç et al. (2010)’s approach yields the completed information that is very close to the result at t = 3 in Table 1. Generally speaking, it appears that the proposed approach here is able to generate the results obtained by the methods given by Genç et al. (2010) and Xia and Xu (2011) by properly setting the value of t. On the other hand, the models in Genç et al. (2010) and Xia and Xu (2011) do not possess a mechanism to address the acceptable uncertainty ratio issue for the estimated missing values. In addition, a decision-maker may sometimes provide the lower or upper bound of an interval judgment based on a pessimistic or optimistic scenario. In this case, a missing value inR¯is not entirely unknown but only its lower or upper bound is unknown, such as the incomplete IARCMs in Example 2 in Section 5. It is worth noting that the two estimation models in Genç et al. (2010) and Xia and Xu (2011) cannot handle such missing values, but our approach is convenient in tackling these cases.Group decisions often occur when multiple stakeholders are involved in a decision situation and the final choice has to account for all stakeholders’ input. Consider a GDM problem with a decision alternative set X = {x1, x2, …, xn}. Assume that D = {d1, d2, …, dm} is a set of decision-makers, and the importance weights of m decision-makers are (λ1, λ2, …, λm)Twith∑l=1mλl=1and λl≥ 0 for l = 1, 2, …, m. Each DM dl(l = 1, 2, …, m) provides his/her judgment over each pair of alternatives as an incomplete IARCMR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij−(l),rij+(l)])n×n.By (4.7) and (4.8), missing values inR¯(l)can be estimated to yield a corresponding complete IARCMR¯(l)c=(r¯ij(l)c)n×n=([rij−(l)c,rij+(l)c])n×n(l = 1, 2, …, m). Next, a key issue is to aggregate the completed IARCMsR¯(l)c(l = 1, 2, …, m) into a group IARCM. The following discussion takes the same multiplicative consistency line of thinking.Let(5.1)rij−G=∏l=1m(rij−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rij−(l)c)λl+∏l=1m(1−rij−(l)c)λl,∀i,j=1,2,…,nwhere∑l=1mλl=1and λl≥ 0 for all l = 1, 2, …, m. Eq. (5.1) is an aggregation method based on the weighted geometric mean.Theorem 5.1LetR¯(l)c=(r¯ij(l)c)n×n=([rij−(l)c,rij+(l)c])n×n(l = 1, 2, …, m) be complete IARCMs with0<rij−(l)c≤rij+(l)c<1,∀i,j=1,2,…,n, andrij−Gbe defined by (5.1), thenR¯G=(r¯ijG)n×n=([rij−G,1−rji−G])n×nis an IARCM.Obviously,rii−G=1−rii−G=0.5,0<rij−G<1,0<1−rji−G<1,for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n.On the other hand,rij−(l)c≤rij+(l)c=1−rji−(l)c∀l=1,2,…,m⇒1rij−(l)c≥11−rji−(l)c∀l=1,2,…,m⇒(1rij−(l)c−1)λl≥(11−rji−(l)c−1)λl∀l=1,2,…,m⇒∏l=1m(1−rij−(l)crij−(l)c)λl+1≥∏l=1m(rji−(l)c1−rji−(l)c)λl+1⇒1∏l=1m(1−rij−(l)crij−(l)c)λl+1≤1∏l=1m(rji−(l)c1−rji−(l)c)λl+1⇒∏l=1m(rij−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rij−(l)c)λl+∏l=1m(1−rij−(l)c)λl=rij−G≤∏l=1m(1−rji−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rji−(l)c)λl+∏l=1m(1−rji−(l)c)λl=1−rji−GAs per Definition 2.2,R¯Gis an IARCM.□LetR¯(l)c=(r¯ij(l)c)n×n=([rij−(l)c,rij+(l)c])n×n(l = 1, 2, …, m) be complete IARCMs with0<rij−(l)c≤rij+(l)c<1, andrij−Gbe defined by(5.1). If allR¯(l)c(l = 1, 2, …, m) have multiplicative consistency, thenR¯G=(r¯ijG)n×n=([rij−G,1−rji−G])n×nhas multiplicative consistency.As per (5.1), we haverij−G1−rij−Grjk−G1−rjk−Grki−G1−rki−G=∏l=1m(rij−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rij−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rjk−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rjk−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rki−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rki−(l)c)λl=∏l=1m(rij−(l)crjk−(l)crki−(l)c(1−rij−(l)c)(1−rjk−(l)c)(1−rki−(l)c))λlandrik−G1−rik−Grkj−G1−rkj−Grji−G1−rji−G=∏l=1m(rik−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rik−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rkj−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rkj−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(rji−(l)c)λl∏l=1m(1−rji−(l)c)λl=∏l=1m(rik−(l)crkj−(l)crji−(l)c(1−rik−(l)c)(1−rkj−(l)c)(1−rji−(l)c))λlAsR¯(l)c(l = 1, 2, …, m) are all multiplicative consistent, by (3.2), one can obtainrij−(l)crjk−(l)crki−(l)c(1−rij−(l)c)(1−rjk−(l)c)(1−rki−(l)c)=rik−(l)crkj−(l)crji−(l)c(1−rik−(l)c)(1−rkj−(l)c)(1−rji−(l)c),∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n,l=1,2,…,m.Thus,rij−G1−rij−Grjk−G1−rjk−Grki−G1−rki−G=rik−G1−rik−Grkj−G1−rkj−Grji−G1−rji−G,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,n. By Corollary 3.1,R¯Ghas multiplicative consistency.□Theorem 5.1 indicates that a group complete IARCMR¯Gis obtained by aggregating individual IARCMs as per (5.1). Theorem 5.2 further reveals thatR¯Ghas multiplicative consistency if all individual complete IARCMs possess such a property.Once the group complete IARCMR¯Gis determined, the next issue for GDM is to derive a priority vector fromR¯G.Letω¯=(ω¯1,ω¯2,⋯,ω¯n)T=([ω1−,ω1+],[ω2−,ω2+],…,[ωn−,ωn+])Tbe an interval-valued weight vector satisfying the following normalization condition (Sugihara, Ishii, & Tanaka, 2004):(5.2)0<ωi−≤ωi+≤1,∑j=1j≠inωj−+ωi+≤1,ωi−+∑j=1j≠inωj+≥1,i=1,2,…,nthen we define the interval multiplicative reciprocal preference or importance intensity of xiover xj(i ≠ j),a¯ij=[aij−,aij+]as[ωi−βijωj+,βijωi+ωj−], where βijis a parameter such thatA∏Aωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+≤βij≤1and βji= βijfor all i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j.Leta¯ii=[aii−,aii+]=[1,1], one can verify thataij−aji+=1, i.e.,a¯ij=1a¯jifor all i, j = 1, 2, …, n. Therefore,A=(a¯ij)n×nis an interval multiplicative comparison matrix introduced by Saaty and Vargas (1987).It should be noted that interval arithmetic is quite different from crisp arithmetic. Normally,ω¯iω¯i≠[1,1]andω¯iω¯j⊗ω¯jω¯i≠[1,1]. For instance,[0.1,0.15][0.1,0.15]=[23,32]≠[1,1]and[0.1,0.15][0.2,0.3]⊗[0.2,0.3][0.1,0.15]=[49,94]≠[1,1]. This indicates that a difference exists in the uncertainty ratio obtained from the parameterized pairwise comparison intervala¯ijand that derived by interval arithmeticω¯iω¯j=[ωi−ωj+,ωi+ωj−].Obviously, for any parameter value βij, the geometric means of the endpoints of all parameterized intervalsa¯ij=[ωi−βijωj+,βijωi+ωj−]are identical to that ofω¯iω¯jasA∏Aωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+≤βij≤1, but the uncertainty ratio differs between[ωi−βijωj+,βijωi+ωj−]andω¯iω¯j. Ifβij=A∏Aωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+, one hasaij−=aij+=A∏Aωi−ωi+ωj−ωj+, indicating that the pairwise comparison between xiand xjis reduced to a crisp judgment without any uncertainty. In this case, the maximal difference is achieved in the uncertainty ratio ofa¯ijandω¯iω¯j. If βij= 1, thena¯ij=[ωi−ωj+,ωi+ωj−]=ω¯iω¯j, implying that the pairwise comparisona¯ijbetween xiand xjis strictly based on interval arithmetic and, hence, there is no difference in uncertainty ratio ofa¯ijandω¯iω¯j. IfA∏Aωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+<βij<1, thenaij−=ωi−βijωj+<βijωi+ωj−=aij+and1<(βij)2ωi+ωj+ωi−ωj−<ωi+ωj+ωi−ωj−, indicating that the pairwise comparison between xiand xj,a¯ij, is not strictly based on interval arithmetic, and a difference exists in the uncertainty ratio ofa¯ijandω¯iω¯j. The larger the βij, the smaller the difference in the uncertainty ratio. Therefore, βijis a parameter that characterizes the difference in the uncertainty ratio of the pairwise comparisona¯ijand the result determined by interval arithmeticω¯iω¯j.On the other hand, for any interval multiplicative reciprocal judgment[aij−,aij+], its corresponding interval additive judgment can be determined as[aij−1+aij−,aij+1+aij+]. As per the multiplicative reciprocal property ofaij−aji+=1,i,j=1,2,…,n, one can obtain0<aij−1+aij−≤aij+1+aij+<1andaij−1+aij−+aji+1+aji+=aij−1+aij−+1aij−+1=1for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n. Therefore, for a given interval-valued priority weight vectorω¯, the interval additive reciprocal preference or importance intensity of xiover xj,t¯ij=[tij−,tij+], can be denoted by the following parameterized transformation function:(5.3)t¯ij=[tij−,tij+]={[0.5,0.5]i=j[ωi−ωi−+βijωj+,βijωi+ωj−+βijωi+]i≠jwhere βijis a parameter such thatA∏Aωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+≤βij≤1and βji= βijfor all i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j.Theorem 5.3Lett¯ij(i,j=1,2,…,n)be defined by (5.3). If0<ωi−≤ωi+≤1for all i = 1, 2, …, n, thenT¯=(t¯ij)n×nis an IARCM with multiplicative consistency.Obviously,0≤tij−≤1,0≤tij+≤1,tii−=tii+=0.5andtii−+tii+=1for i, j = 1, 2, …, n. Sinceβji= βij, we havetij−+tji+=ωi−ωi−+βijωj++βjiωj+ωi−+βjiωj+=1andtij++tji−=βijωi+ωj−+βijωi++ωj−ωj−+βjiωi+=1for i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j. Thus, by Definition 2.2,T¯=(t¯ij)n×nis an IARCM.As βji= βijfor all i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j, by (5.3), one getstij−tji+tjk−tkj+tki−tik+=ωi−βjiωj+ωj−βkjωk+ωk−βikωi+=ωi−βkiωk+ωk−βjkωj+ωj−βijωi+=tik−tki+tkj−tjk+tji−tij+By Corollary 3.1,R¯Ghas multiplicative consistency.□Theorem 5.3 reveals thatt¯ij(i ≠ j) reflects the interval additive reciprocal preference intensity of xiover xj. By setting βijat different values, numerous multiplicative consistent IARCMs are obtained for a given normalized interval-valued weight vector.As per Theorem 5.3, ifR¯G=T¯, then there exists a normalized interval-valued weight vectorω¯=(ω¯1,ω¯2,…,ω¯n)Tand βij(i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j), βji= βijsuch thatrij−G=tij−and1−rji−G=tij+for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n. Apparently, such anR¯Gis an IARCM with multiplicative consistency andω¯=(ω¯1,ω¯2,…,ω¯n)Tis a normalized interval-valued priority vector ofR¯G. However, in many group decision situations,R¯Ghas no multiplicative consistency. In this case, we turn around to find a normalized interval-valued priority vectorω¯=(ω¯1,ω¯2,…,ω¯n)Tand βij(i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j), βji= βijsuch thatR¯G≈T¯. The closerR¯GandT¯is, the better the interval-valued priority vectorω¯=(ω¯1,ω¯2,…,ω¯n)Tis. As per the additive reciprocal property of IARCMs, ifrij−G=ωi−ωi−+βijωj+for i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j, then by βji= βij(i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j), one hasrij+G=1−rji−G=βijωi+ωj−+βijωi+for all i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j. Thus, it is equivalent to find an interval-valued priority vectorω¯and βij(i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j) such that(5.4)rij−G≈ωi−ωi−+βijωj+,i≠jFrom (5.4), we have(5.5)rij−G1−rij−G≈ωi−βijωj+,i≠jEq. (5.5) can be equivalently expressed as(5.6)lnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)≈lnωi−−lnωj+−lnβij,i≠jTherefore, the following logarithmic goal programming model is established to find a group interval-valued priority vector forR¯G.(5.7)minJ=∑i=1n∑j=1,j≠in|lnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβij+lnωj+−lnωi−|s.t.{lnωi−+lnωj−−lnωi+−lnωj+≤2lnβij≤0,lnβji=lnβij,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j0<ωi−≤ωi+≤1,∑j=1j≠inωj−+ωi+≤1,ωi−+∑j=1j≠inωj+≥1.i=1,2,…,nwhere the first group of inequalities are the logarithmic expressions ofωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+≤βij≤1and βij= βji, the remaining constraints are the normalization conditions corresponding to (5.2), andωi−,ωi+(i=1,2,…,n)and βij(i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j) are decision variables.Let(5.8)ɛij=lnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβij+lnωj+−lnωi−(5.9)ɛij+=|ɛij|+ɛij2,ɛij−=|ɛij|−ɛij2for i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j.Thus, we haveɛij=ɛij+−ɛij−,|ɛij|=ɛij++ɛij−andɛij+ɛij−=0for i, j = 1, 2, …, n, i ≠ j. Therefore, model (5.7) is equivalently transformed to the following model:(5.10)minJ=∑i=1n∑j=1,j≠in(ɛij++ɛij−)s.t.{lnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβij+lnωj+−lnωi−−ɛij++ɛij−=0,i<j=1,2,…,nlnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβji+lnωj+−lnωi−−ɛij++ɛij−=0,i>j=1,2,…,nlnωi−+lnωj−−lnωi+−lnωj+≤2lnβij≤0,i<j=1,2,…,n0<ωi−≤ωi+≤1,∑j=1j≠inωj−+ωi+≤1,ωi−+∑j=1j≠inωj+≥1,i=1,2,…,nɛij+≥0,ɛij−≥0.i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠jwhereωi−,ωi+(i=1,2,…,n), βij( j > i = 1, 2, …, n) andɛij+,ɛij−(i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j)are decision variables.Multiple solutions may exist for model (5.10). In order to obtain a reasonable decision result, it is natural to expect that the group opinion inR¯Gbe sufficiently reflected by the final interval-valued priority vector as per interval arithmetic. Asωi−ωj−ωi+ωj+≤βij≤1, and the larger the βij, the closerT¯is to the result of interval arithmetic operations, it is sensible to select a solution of (5.10) that maximizes βij( j > i = 1, 2, …, n) without sacrificing the consistency level. Based on this idea, we establish the following goal programming model, which takes the optimal objective value J* of (5.10) as a constraint.(5.11)maxJ′=∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nβijs.t.{lnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβij+lnωj+−lnωi−−ɛij++ɛij−=0,j>i=1,2,…,nlnrij−G−ln(1−rij−G)+lnβji+lnωj+−lnωi−−ɛij++ɛij−=0,i>j=1,2,…,nlnωi−+lnωj−−lnωi+−lnωj+≤2lnβij≤0,j>i=1,2,…,n∑i=1n∑j=1,j≠in(ɛij++ɛij−)=J*0<ωi−≤ωi+≤1,∑j=1j≠inωj−+ωi+≤1,ωi−+∑j=1j≠inωj+≥1,i=1,2,…,nɛij+≥0,ɛij−≥0.i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠jBy solving (5.11), we obtain an optimal group interval-valued priority vector denoted byω¯*=(ω¯1*,ω¯2*,…,ω¯n*)T=([ω1−*,ω1+*],[ω2−*,ω2+*],…,[ωn−*,ωn+*])TforR¯G.Based on the foresaid analyses, the following algorithm for GDM with incomplete IARCMs is now developed and graphically illustrated in Fig. 1.Algorithm 1Step 1. Consider a GDM problem with a set of decision alternatives X = {x1, x2, …, xn} and a group of decision-makers D = {d1, d2, …, dm}. The decision-makers’ importance weight vector is λ = (λ1, λ2, …, λm)Twith∑l=1mλl=1and λl≥ 0 (l = 1, 2, …, m). The decision-makers furnish their pairwise comparisons on X by means of incomplete IARCMsR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij−(l),rij+(l)])n×n(l = 1, 2, …, m).Step 2. Solicit an acceptable uncertainty ratio threshold t from the decision-makers and estimate missing values for eachR¯(l)(l = 1, 2, …, m) by solving the models (4.7) and (4.8), thereby deriving the individual complete IARCMsR¯(l)c=(r¯ij(l)c)n×n=([rij−(l)c,rij+(l)c])n×n(l = 1, 2, …, m$]) as per (4.9).Step 3. Aggregate individual complete IARCMsR¯(l)c(l = 1, 2, …, m) together with the decision-maker weights λl(l = 1, 2, …, m) into a group opinionR¯G=(r¯ijG)n×n=([rij−G,1−rji−G])n×nas per (5.1).Step 4. Determine the optimal objective value J* by solving (5.10).Step 5. Solve model (5.11) and, then obtain an optimal group interval-valued priority vectorω¯*=(ω¯1*,ω¯2*,…,ω¯n*)T=([ω1−*,ω1+*],[ω2−*,ω2+*],…,[ωn−*,ωn+*])TforR¯G.Step 6. Establish the possibility matrixP=(pij)n×n=(P(ω¯i*≥ω¯j*))n×nas per the following possibility formula (Wang, Yang, & Xu, 2005; Xu & Chen, 2008).(5.12)P(a¯≥b¯)=max{0,a+−b−}−max{0,a−−b+}a+−a−+b+−b−wherea¯=[a−,a+]andb¯=[b−,b+]are two positive interval numbers.Step 7. Add up all values in each row of P, we getϕi=∑j=1npij(i = 1, 2, …, n).Step 8. As per the decreasing order of the values ϕi(i = 1, 2, …, n), a ranking of all decision alternatives is obtained, and “xibeing preferred toxj” is expressed asxi⪰P(ω¯i*G≥ω¯j*G)xj.Next, we present a GDM problem concerning selecting a supplier for a mobile phone manufacturing firm (adapted from Wan & Li, 2013) to illustrate the proposed decision models.Example 2With the growing trend of economic globalization, efficient supply chain management becomes critical for a firm to improve its competitive advantage in a global market. This example examines a supplier selection problem, where four suppliers X = {x1, x2, x3, x4} are determined as potential candidates and a selection committee is called to evaluate the four suppliers. Assume that the committee comprises three decision-makers dl(l = 1, 2, 3), with varying importance weights λ = (λ1, λ2, λ3)T= (0.35, 0.4, 0.25)T. Each decision-maker dl(l = 1, 2, 3) conducts pairwise comparison on the four suppliers and furnishes his/her judgments by means of an incomplete IARCMR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))4×4=([rij−(l),rij+(l)])4×4.R¯(1)=[[0.5,0.5][0.6,0.8][−,0.75][0.4,0.7][0.2,0.4][0.5,0.5]−[0.35,0.55][0.25,−]−[0.5,0.5][0.3,−][0.3,0.6][0.45,0.65][−,0.7][0.5,0.5]]R¯(2)=[[0.5,0.5][−,0.7][0.5,0.75]−[0.3,−][0.5,0.5][0.3,−][0.55,0.8][0.25,0.5][−,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8]−[0.2,0.45][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]]R¯(3)=[[0.5,0.5][0.1,0.3]−[0.3,−][0.7,0.9][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.4]−−[0.6,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][−,0.7]−[0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]]For the missing values inR¯(l)(l = 1, 2, 3), if the acceptable uncertainty ratios of estimated interval additive reciprocal judgments are expected to be less than or equal to 4, then we can set t = 4 for model (4.7). In this case, by solving (4.7), their corresponding optimal objective values are obtained as:J(1)*=1.863116,J(2)*=0.1519312,J(3)*=3.632376.PluggingJ*=J(l)*and t0 = 4 into (4.8), we obtain the following optimal solutions.r13−(1)*=0.6418,r23−(1)*=0.3212,r32−(1)*=0.3457,r43−(1)*=0.3684.r12−(2)*=0.7000,r14−(2)*=0.7206,r32−(2)*=0.4375,r41−(2)*=0.0884.r13−(3)*=0.0655,r24−(3)*=0.4955,r31−(3)*=0.7809,r41−(3)*=0.7000,r42−(3)*=0.2029.As per (4.9), the completed IARCMsR¯(l)c=(r¯ij(l)c)4×4=([rij−(l)c,rij+(l)c])4×4(l = 1, 2, 3) are determined as follows.R¯(1)c=[[0.5,0.5][0.6,0.8][0.6418,0.75][0.4,0.7][0.2,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.3212,0.6543][0.35,0.55][0.25,0.3582][0.3457,0.6788][0.5,0.5][0.3,0.6316][0.3,0.6][0.45,0.65][0.3684,0.7][0.5,0.5]]R¯(2)c=[[0.5,0.5][0.7,0.7][0.5,0.75][0.7206,0.9116][0.3,0.3][0.5,0.5][0.3,0.5625][0.55,0.8][0.25,0.5][0.4375,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.0884,0.2794][0.2,0.45][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]]R¯(3)c=[[0.5,0.5][0.1,0.3][0.0655,0.2129][0.3,0.3][0.7,0.9][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.4][0.4955,0.7971][0.7809,0.9345][0.6,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.7,0.7][0.2029,0.5045][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]]By (5.1), the group IARCM is obtained asR¯G=(r¯ijG)4×4=([rij−G,1−rji−G])4×4=[[0.5,0.5][0.4829,0.6485][0.3869,0.6239][0.5063,0.7346][0.3515,0.5171][0.5,0.5][0.2794,0.5554][0.4648,0.7245][0.3761,0.6131][0.4446,0.7206][0.5,0.5][0.5632,0.7483][0.2654,0.4937][0.2755,0.5352][0.2517,0.4368][0.5,0.5]]PluggingR¯Ginto (5.10) and, then solving this model yields its optimal objective value J* = 0.5532709.By solving (5.11), we obtain the optimal group interval-valued priority vectorω¯*=(ω¯1*,ω¯2*,ω¯3*,ω¯4*)T=([0.2021,0.3647],[0.1519,0.2817],[0.2255,0.3917],[0.1318,0.1749])T.As per the possibility formula (5.12), the possibility matrix is determined asP=[0.50.72780.423410.27220.50.18990.86700.57660.81010.5100.133000.5]Adding up all values in each row, we obtain ϕ1 = 2.6512, ϕ2 = 1.8291, ϕ3 = 2.8867 and ϕ4 = 0.6330.As ϕ3 > ϕ1 > ϕ2 > ϕ4, the four suppliers are ranked asx3≻57.66%x1≻72.78%x2≻86.70%x4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A goal programming framework is developed to solve GDM problems with incomplete IARCMs. A key characteristic of this research is to take an integrative approach to addressing uncertainty and inconsistency of decision-makers’ pairwise judgments. Based on the multiplicative consistency concept (Wang & Li, 2012), new properties of consistent IARCMs are first investigated and employed to define multiplicative consistent incomplete IARCMs. A two-step goal programming method is then established to estimate missing values for an individual incomplete IARCM. By employing the lower bounds of the interval additive reciprocal judgments, a weighted geometric mean approach is subsequently proposed to aggregate individual IARCMs into a group IARCM. By analyzing the inherent link among normalized interval-valued weights, multiplicative consistent IARCMs and their uncertainty levels, a two-step procedure comprising two goal programming models is eventually developed to derive an interval-valued priority vector from the group IARCM. Two numerical examples are furnished to illustrate the proposed models.Further research is needed to address some significant issues. For instance, it is unclear how to judge and deal with extremely uncertain or/and inconsistent information in the original incomplete IARCMs provided by decision-makers. It is contemplated that the notion of acceptable consistency and uncertainty ratios has to be further explored and an interactive decision mechanism may have to be introduced to gauge the acceptance of the input data given by decision-makers. After these issues are properly addressed, it would be worthwhile to investigate how the current framework can be adapted to handle these cases.
