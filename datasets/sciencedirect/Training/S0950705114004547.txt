@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper develops a two-phase fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach for multi-level linear programming (MLLP) problems in an uncertain environment. A numerical MLLP model is established based on a confidence level. In the first phase, an FGP model is used to find a solution that reaches the overall satisfaction of all decision-makers (DMs), ensuring that the fuzzy goal of each higher-level DM is more satisfied than those of lower-level DMs. Since the higher-level DM has the direct authority to manage the subordinate DM, an adjustment scheme is provided in the second phase for each higher-level DM, who has the opportunity to increase or decrease the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal by changing the relative satisfaction of the lower-level DM compared to that of their higher-level DM. A fuzzy variable of the relative satisfaction containing a set of linguistic terms is provided for these adjustments. The adjustment processes are carried out sequentially, from the top to bottom in the hierarchical decision structure. The proposed FGP model in the second phase considers these sequential adjustments. A numerical example and comparisons with existing methods are used to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Hierarchical decision structures are common in government policies, competitive economic systems, supply chains, vehicle path planning problems, and so on. Various studies have proposed mathematical models to solve such problems [10–12,14,33]. In addition to mathematical programming formulations, several solution approaches that adapt to other decision-making environments have been proposed, such as decision support systems [15] and rule sets based approaches [36,37], to solve problems that cannot be precisely formulated as mathematical programming models. In this area, multi-level linear programming (MLLP) is a solution technique for solving hierarchical decision-making problems, assuming that the objectives and associated constraints of decision-makers (DMs) can be expressed as linear algebraic functions. MLLP problems generally include sequential decision processes (from the top to bottom), interactive decision-makings, and a leader–follower relationship within two adjacent levels [10,11]. For MLLP problems, one DM is located at each decision level, and a linear objective function needs to be optimized.Several typical MLLP approaches [1,2,6,28,30–35] have been developed based on vertex enumeration or a nonlinear transformation function with a Lagrangian term. Based on vertex enumeration, Bialas and Karwan [6] proposed the kth-best solution algorithm for bi-level programming problems, which was extended to fuzzy bi-level [31] and fuzzy tri-level programming problems [34,35]. In transformation function approaches [30,33], Lagrangian terms are included based on Kuhn–Tucker conditions to formulate nonlinear models. These approaches may be inefficient in solving large-scale problems, considering the NP-hard property [5] of multi-level programming. Furthermore, the use of a transformation function may produce the following paradox: the final solution more closely approaches the individual optimum of a lower-level DM’s objective function than that of a higher-level DM’s objective function when the two objective functions highly conflict.Lai [11] and Shih et al. [25] considered DMs with imprecise goals for their objective functions [12,13], and presented fuzzy programming models for MLLP problems, in which the lower-level DM’s optimality search is restricted by the higher-level DM’s goal. In these approaches, fuzzy goals are used to describe the objective functions and to characterize each higher-level DM’s decision variables. The resulting solutions can be modified by higher-level DMs level by level. However, methods [11,25] that use the max–min operator [4] for optimization may produce undesirable solutions due to the inconsistency between objective functions and decision variables. To avoid this, Sakawa et al. [21] developed an interactive fuzzy programming approach for solving MLLP problems that eliminates the fuzzy goals of decision variables and specifies each higher-level DM’s achievement of the fuzzy goal in terms of the ratio of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal for each lower-level DM to that of their higher-level DM. This concept has been adopted by several scholars to solve MLLP problems with fuzzy parameters [22,23] and multi-level 0–1 programming problems [19,20]. Sinha [26,27] developed supervised approaches by extending the concept of Sakawa et al. [21] to solve MLLP problems via the redefinition of tolerance values of fuzzy goals. However, the above approaches [19–23,26,27] implement the interactive solution processes by intuitively adjusting the desired satisfaction degrees of the various fuzzy goals. Furthermore, the solution processes in Sinha’s method make the lowest-level DM the most important in the decision structure, because their decisions may remain unchanged or be closest to their individual best ones.Pramanik and Roy [17] adopted fuzzy goals to specify the decision variables of higher-level DMs and proposed weighted/unweighted fuzzy goal programming (FGP) models for MLLP problems to obtain a satisfactory solution. Arora and Gupta [3] extended this approach by employing dynamic programming to solve the FGP model in sequence for bi-level programming problems. However, these methods [3,17] may produce a higher satisfaction degree for the fuzzy goal of a lower-level DM than that for a higher-level one when the former’s goal is relatively easy to achieve. To deal with this problem, Chen and Chen [8,9] applied a fuzzy variable of relative satisfactions between lower- and higher-level DMs to solve the decentralized bi-level optimization problem, ensuring that the integrated satisfaction of the higher-level DM is not less than that of the lower-level DM.The present study develops a two-phase FGP approach for MLLP problems, where all the parameters are expressed as fuzzy numbers based on the fuzzy set theory of Zadeh [29] to account for the uncertainty in decision-making problems [30,31,35]. The concept ofα-cuts [18] is applied to transform fuzzy mathematical problems into common numerical models to simplify the solution processes without losing the fuzzy essence of the problem, where theαlevel is usually regarded as the confidence level of the fuzzy information. This study also employsα-cuts to formulate MLLP problems as FGP models at the desiredαlevel to enhance computational efficiency. In addition, due to the paradox that appears in related MLLP studies, this paper presumes that the goals of higher-level DMs should reach a higher level of satisfaction than those of lower-level DMs. As such, in the first phase, the maximum satisfaction of the overall fuzzy goals is achieved at the desiredαlevel under the condition described above. To ascertain the feasibility of the first phase, a pre-check model is provided to examine whether some leader–follower relationship constraints are violated in terms of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goals before trying to solve the MLLP problem.Based on the solutions from the first phase, an adjustment scheme is provided in the second phase for each higher-level DM, who can increase (or decrease) the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal by decreasing (or increasing) the satisfaction degree of the subordinate DMs in the hierarchical decision structure. A fuzzy decision variable is used to achieve this, in which a linguistic term is used to express the relative satisfaction of the fuzzy goal for each lower-level DM compared to that of their higher-level DM. The linguistic terms specify the adjustment of the satisfaction degree and ensure that the satisfaction degree of a lower-level DM does not exceed that of the higher-level DM. In addition, for a DM at a given level, the determined (adjusted or unchanged) satisfaction degrees and the associated relative satisfactions for the upper-level DMs are treated as the constraints when such a DM adjusts the satisfaction of his fuzzy goal to meet the characteristics of MLLP problems. The adjustment process is performed iteratively from the top to bottom, excluding the DM at the lowest level. In addition, to enhance solution efficiency, this study employs the method of variable change [16] to transform linear fractional goal programming into linear programming. The validity of this method was proven by Charnes and Cooper [7]. Using the concept of variable change [16], the proposed second-phase model with linear fractional constraints is formulated to have a linear form. With the proposed two-phase approach, each DM achieves a satisfactory or acceptable degree of their fuzzy goal.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the formulation of MLLP problems with fuzzy numbers. Section 3 describes the proposed two-phase FGP approach. Two numerical examples are provided in Section 4 to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed models and demonstrate the violation of leader–follower relationship in terms of the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goals in an MLLP problem, respectively. Comparisons with existing approaches and a sensitivity analysis are also presented in this section. Discussions of the proposed approach are provided in Section 5, and the conclusions are given in Section 6.MLLP problems have more than one DM. A DM is located at each decision level, and a linear objective function needs to be optimized. Considering the uncertainty inherent in the decision-making process [12], this paper formulates MLLP problems with all the parameters in the objective functions and constraints expressed as fuzzy numbers based on fuzzy set theory [29]. LetI={1,2,…,k}be the set of all DMs (DMi,i=1,…,k) from the top (level 1) to the bottom (levelk), andIh={1,…,k-1}be the set of higher-level DMs. All the decision variables in MLLP problems are defined with an n-dimensional column vectorx=x1T,x2T,…,xkTT∈Rn, where T denotes the transpose of the vector. The vector x can be partitioned into k column vectors whereDMi,i∈I, has anni-dimensional vector of decision variables in the objective function, i.e.,xi∈Rni,∑i=1kni=n. In the formulation of MLLP problems, each DM has only one maximization-type objective function that contains the decision vectors of all the DMs. The MLLP problem with fuzzy parameters can be represented as follows:(1)(level1)DM1:Maxf1(x)=c̃11x1+c̃12x2+⋯+c̃1kxk(level2)DM2:Maxf2(x)=c̃21x1+c̃22x2+⋯+c̃2kxk⋮⋮⋮(levelk)DMk:Maxfk(x)=c̃k1x1+c̃k2x2+⋯+c̃kkxksubject tox∈Q̃=x=x1T,x2T,…,xkTT∈RnÃx⩽b̃,x⩾0wherec̃ij,i,j∈I, is thenj-dimensional row vector of the coefficients for the jth decision vector of the ith objective function;b̃is an m-dimensional column vector;Ãis a fuzzy coefficient matrix with sizem×n; andQ̃represents the feasible region defined by m constraints in the fuzzy environment. All the parameters in the vectorsc̃ijandb̃and matrixÃare expressed as fuzzy numbers [30,31,35] characterized by any type of membership function, such as triangular or trapezoidal, depending on the DM’s preference.A two-phase FGP approach is proposed in this section for solving the MLLP problems set out above. To increase computational efficiency, the concept ofα-cuts [18] is adopted to transform the MLLP problems with parameters represented by fuzzy numbers into common numerical problems. Based on the numerical MLLP formulation, the FGP model is constructed in the first phase. This study presumes that the satisfaction degree for each higher-level DM should not be less than that of their lower-level DMs in an MLLP problem. As such, the objective of the first phase is to find the possible maximum satisfaction degrees for all the objective functions, ensuring higher satisfaction degrees for higher-level DMs compared to those of lower-level DMs. The second phase provides an adjustment scheme for each higher-level DM, who can then adjust the resulting satisfaction degrees.Based on model (1), the coefficients in each objective function are represented as fuzzy numbers in row-vector form. In matrix form, the fuzzy coefficients for all objective functions can be represented as:(2)C̃=c̃(1)c̃(2)⋮c̃(k)=c̃11(1)…c̃11(n1)c̃12(1)…c̃12(n2)…c̃1k(1)…c̃1k(nk)c̃21(1)…c̃21(n1)c̃22(1)…c̃22(n2)…c̃2k(1)…c̃2k(nk)⋮⋮…⋮c̃k1(1)…c̃k1(n1)c̃k2(1)…c̃k2(n2)…c̃kk(1)…c̃kk(nk)=c̃1(1)c̃1(2)…c̃1(n)c̃2(1)c̃2(2)…c̃2(n)⋮⋮⋮⋮c̃k(1)c̃k(2)…c̃k(n)wheren=n1+n2+⋯+nk. Letμc̃(i),μb̃, andμÃbe the membership functions that characterize the fuzzy numbers in the corresponding vectorsc̃(i)andb̃and matrixÃ, respectively. In general, a fuzzy set can be fully and uniquely represented by itsα-cuts,α∈[0,1], which are defined as the numerical intervals in which the membership degrees of the elements (values for fuzzy numbers) belonging to the fuzzy set are greater than or equal to theαdegree [12]. Theα-cuts ofc̃(i),b̃, andÃare defined as:(3a)(c(i))α=c(i)∈(c(i))αL,(c(i))αUμc̃(i)⩾α,c(i)∈S(c̃(i)),i∈I(3b)(b)α=b∈(b)αL,(b)αUμb̃⩾α,b∈S(b̃)(3c)(A)α=A∈(A)αL,(A)αUμÃ⩾α,A∈S(Ã)whereS(c̃(i)),S(b̃), andS(Ã)are the supports of the corresponding vectors and matrix of fuzzy numbers, and theαvalue represents the confidence level of the fuzzy parameter.To deal with fuzzy decision-making problems, a DM usually finds the optimum solutions based on a desired or acceptableαlevel. The numerical interval determined from anα-cut can thus be applied to MLLP model (1) when theαvalue is specified. For the constraint(A)αx⩽(b)αat the givenαlevel, the constraints with the lower bound(A)αLand upper bound(b)αUof the coefficients are set to have the largest feasible region, so that the optimum solutions for objective functions are most likely to be found. In addition, the maximum values of objective functions should be closely related to the settings of the coefficients. To this end, the upper bound of the coefficients in the objective functions at the givenαlevel,(c(i))αU, is adopted in order to reach the maximum for each objective function when FGP models are established in the first phase. Therefore, the numerical MLLP problem can be formulated as:(4)(level1)DM1:Maxf1(x)=(c(1))αUx(level2)DM2:Maxf2(x)=(c(2))αUx⋮⋮⋮(levelk)DMk:Maxfk(x)=(c(k))αUxsubject tox∈Qα=x∈Rn(A)αLx⩽(b)αU,x⩾0,α∈[0,1]whereQαdenotes the feasible region at anαlevel.The first phase aims to find the optimal solutions to maximize the total satisfaction of all objective functions in terms of fuzzy goals at the givenαlevel. The objective function for each DM is formulated as the fuzzy goal characterized by the membership functionμf(i),α,i∈I, at the givenαlevel. The model formulations and resolution processes in the two phases are carried out with the givenαlevel. For simplification, the notation “α” is omitted hereafter in the resulting associated variables. For example,μf(i),αis denoted asμf(i).To define the membership functions of the fuzzy goals [17], each objective function’s individual maximum is taken as the corresponding aspiration level, as follows:(5)fiB=fi(x¯i)=Maxx∈Qαfix,(c(i))αU,i∈Iwherex¯i=x1,…,xiB,…,xkis an individual maximum solution forDMi. The vectorxiBcontainsDMi’s optimum decision valuesxiωB,ω∈Ni={1,2,…,ni},i∈Ih. Considering the relationship between the DMs at the adjacent two levels in MLLP problems, the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal for the lower-level DM is usually limited to be less than that of the higher-level DM. In the extreme case, the maximum satisfaction degree of the higher-level DM’s fuzzy goal minimizes the lower-level DM’s satisfaction. Based on previous studies [12,17], the optimum solution of the higher-levelDMi-1’s objective function is used to find the minimal value of the lower-levelDMi’s objective function, so as to define the membership function of each lower-level DM’s fuzzy goal. Therefore, the minimal value ofDMi’s objective function is defined as:(6)fiW=fix¯i-1,(c(i))αU,i≠1mini≠1fix¯i≠1,(c(i))αU,i=1Fig. 1shows the membership function defined in (6). In the above expression, the minimal value of the objective function for the top-level DM(DM1)is determined using the optimal solution for oneDMiat the lower level, i.e.,i>1. With the fuzzy coefficients, the membership functions of fuzzy goals that take the formfix,(ci)αU≥∼fiBfor the MLLP problem (4) can thus be defined as:(7)μf(i)=1iffix,(ci)αU⩾fiBfix,(ci)αU-fiWfiB-fiWiffiW⩽fix,(ci)αU⩽fiB0iffix,(ci)αU⩽fiWSince the optimality for each lower-level DM’s fuzzy goal should be constrained by the higher-level DMs’ goals, each higher-levelDMi’s optimum decision valuexiωB,ω∈Ni={1,2,…,ni},i∈Ih, in the vectorxiBis fuzzified by the linguistic term “around”, expressed asxiω=∼xiωB, to avoid a decision deadlock when optimizing fuzzy goals for all the DMs. The membership function, as shown in Fig. 2, forxiωBcan be represented as:(8)μx(iω)=xiωB+qiωR-xiωqiωRifxiωB⩽xiω⩽xiωB+qiωR1ifxiω=xiωBxiω-xiωB-qiωLqiωLifxiωB-qiωL⩽xiω⩽xiωB0otherwisewhere the rightqiωRand leftqiωLtolerances are subjectively specified byDMi. In general, a DM at a lower level will provide wider tolerances than those of a DM at a higher level. The membership functionsμx(iω)are taken as the constraints in the model [3,11,17,24–27].In addition, for two DMs at adjacent levels, the constraintμf(i)⩾μf(i+1),i∈Ih={1,2,…,k-1}, is included in the model to ensure that the satisfaction degree of a lower-level DM does not exceed that of their higher-level DM, even if the goal of the lower-level DM is relatively easy to satisfy. Based on this, the FGP model is formulated in the first phase to determine the optimal solutions by minimizing the deviation variables as follows:(9.1)Min∑i=1kdf(i)-+∑i=1k-1∑ω=1nidx(iω)-+dx(iω)+subject to(9.2)μf(i)+df(i)--df(i)+=1i=1,…,k(9.3)μx(iω)+dx(iω)--dx(iω)+=1ω=1,…,ni,i=1,…,k-1(9.4)μf(i)⩾μf(i+1)i=1,…,k-1(9.5)df(i)-,df(i)+⩾0i=1,…,k(9.6)dx(iω)-,dx(iω)+⩾0ω=1,…,ni,i=1,…,k-1(9.7)x∈Qαwheredf(i)-,dx(iω)-,df(i)+, anddx(iω)+denote the under- and over-deviation variables for the corresponding fuzzy goals and the associated decision variables, respectively. Note that constraint (9.3) containsni(k-1) equations.The solutions from model (9) can provide the maximum satisfaction of the overall fuzzy goals, under the condition that each higher-level DM should better satisfy their goal than that of a lower-level DM. However, for some particular cases, this condition cannot be satisfied, due to conflicts between the fuzzy goals of higher- and lower-level DMs, and this makes model (9) infeasible. To deal with this, a pre-check model is provided to examine the feasibility of the constraintμf(i)⩾μf(i+1),i∈Ih={1,2,…,k-1}, for any two DMs at adjacent levels, as follows:(10.1)Min∑i=1k-1δisubject to(10.2)δi⩾μf(i+1)-μf(i)i=1,2…,k-1(10.3)δi⩾0i=1,2…,k-1(10.4)x∈μf-1,μx(i)-1,Qαwhereμf-1andμx(i)-1are the vectors of inverse functions of membership functions (7) and (8), respectively. If the value of objective function (10.1) is zero, i.e.,δi=0for alli∈Ih, the leader–follower relationship constraintsμf(i)⩾μf(i+1),i∈Ih, are met between any two DMs at adjacent levels, and model (9) is feasible for finding an optimum solution. In contrast, some leadership-follower relationship constraints are violated whenδi≠0for somei∈Ih, which makes model (9) infeasible. In this situation, the problem cannot be treated as an MLLP one investigated in this study, because it is not possible to find a solution to satisfy these constraints, even when the second phase is applied. However, one way to overcome this problem is to remove the violated constraints based on model (10) from model (9). Then, the optimal solutions satisfying the remaining leader–follower relationship constraints can be obtained as the final solutions.Based on the solutions from the first phase, DMs can determine the satisfaction degrees of the corresponding fuzzy goals. In the second phase, all the higher-level DMs (DMi,i=1,…,k-1) are allowed to adjust their satisfaction degrees if the fuzzy goals are not satisfied. To meet the requirement that the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal of a DM should be higher than that of the DM at a lower level, an adjustment scheme that considers the decision hierarchy is carried out from the top to bottom sequentially. Each adjustment process, activated by the higher-level DM, is performed by considering two DMs at adjacent levels at a given time. The process is iterative and ends after the lowest level has been considered.To include the characteristic of vagueness when determining the adjustment of satisfaction degrees, a fuzzy variable of relative satisfaction is defined asẼi,i∈Ih={1,2,…,k-1}, based on the concept presented by Chen and Chen [8,9]. The fuzzy variableẼiincludes a set of linguistic termsSi={1,2,…,vi}for each higher-levelDMi,i∈Ih, to describe the level of the relative satisfaction of the lower-levelDMi+1compared to their own. The relative satisfaction betweenDMi+1andDMiis measured by the ratio ofμf(i+1)toμf(i), i.e.,pi=μf(i+1)/μf(i),i∈Ih[8,9,11,21]. Each linguistic term is characterized by a membership function with the base variable ofpiand the most likely valuepẼ(i,s),s∈Si. In addition, the base variablepiis delimited by the upper boundpiU=1, which corresponds to the constraintμf(i)⩾μf(i+1)in model (9). The lower bound is determined aspiL=μf(i+1)(x¯i)/μf(i)(x¯i), which is similar to the expression in (6), to determine the minimum value ofDMi’s objective function. The membership functions used to characterizevilinguistic terms for each higher-levelDMican be defined in the intervalpiL,piU. Each membership function has an equal spread, and the most likely value is defined aspẼ(i,s)=piL+(s-1)piU-piL/(vi-1),i=1,2,…,k-1,s=1,2,…,vi. That is, the most likely valuepẼ(i,s)of the sth linguistic term is determined by adding (s-1) spreadspiU-piL/(vi-1)to the lower boundpiL. Therefore, the membership functionμẼ(i,s),s=2,…,vi-1, as shown in Fig. 3, can be defined as:(11)μẼ(i,s)=pi-pẼ(i,s-1)pẼ(i,s)-pẼ(i,s-1)ifpẼ(i,s-1)⩽pi⩽pẼ(i,s),s=2,3,…,vi1ifpi=pẼ(i,s)pẼ(i,s+1)-pipẼ(i,s+1)-pẼ(i,s)ifpẼ(i,s)⩽pi⩽pẼ(i,s+1),s=1,2,…,vi-10otherwiseNote that the membership functions for the lowest and highest levels of the relative satisfaction betweenDMi+1andDMiare determined when s is set to 1 andvi, respectively. Fig. 3 shows five linguistic terms, from “very low” to “very high”, which are regarded as the linguistic levels in order, i.e.,Si={1,2,…,5}.Suppose that one higher-levelDMi,i∈Ih, desires to adjust the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal through the relative satisfaction ofDMi+1compared to that of their own. The linguistic term that can best describe the current relative satisfaction should be determined. To do this, the linguistic term that has the highest membership degree of relative satisfaction is selected. To calculate the relative satisfaction, the current optimal solutionsx(i)′are applied. Letx(i)′be the optimal solutions ofDMiobtained from the adjustment process betweenDMiandDMi+1, regardless of whetherDMi+1performs the adjustment. In particular, forDM1, the optimal solutionsx(1)′obtained from the first phase are used to determine whether the adjustment is needed. The relative satisfaction ofDMi+1compared to that ofDMican be expressed aspi′=μf(i+1)x(i)′/μf(i)x(i)′,i∈Ih, and the linguistic levels′with the maximal membership degreeμẼ(i,s′)can be determined as:(12)μẼ(i,s′)max=maxs∈SiμẼ(i,s)pi′pi′=μf(i+1)x(i)′/μf(i)x(i)′,i∈IhFig. 4shows the membership function with the maximum degree ofpi′. The linguistic term with the maximal membership degreeμẼ(i,s′)maxdetermined in (12) is used to judge the need to perform the adjustment process. The adjustment process is carried out by choosing the membership function of the desired linguistic term with the levels″∈Sias the fuzzy goal,μẼ(i,s″), wheres″could be larger or less than the current levels′. The FGP model is established to find the solutions closest to the most possible value ofμẼ(i,s″). ForDMi, if the satisfaction of their fuzzy goal needs to be increased, the desired linguistic levels″should be less than the current levels′. On the other hand, ifDMiis willing to reduce their satisfaction degree to increase that ofDMi+1, a higher linguistic level is selected.More importantly, for the DM at the jth level, i.e.,DMj, to carry out the adjustment process, the accepted satisfaction degrees of the higher-level DMs, i.e.,DMθ,θ<j, as well as the determined linguistic levels‴∈Sθused to describe the relative satisfaction ofDMθcompared to that ofDMθ1, should not be changed when resolving the FGP model to avoid a violation of the solutions determined at levels higher than the jth one. To this end, the constraintμf(θ)⩾βθ,θ<j,θ=1,…,j-1,j∈{2,3,…,k-1}, and the membership function of linguistic levels‴∈Sθin terms of the fuzzy goalμẼ(θ,s‴)are added to the model, whereβθdenotes the accepted satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal of the DM at levelθ. The above constraints and fuzzy goals are not needed forDM1. In addition, for the DMs at levels lower than that ofDMj, i.e.,DMℓ,ℓ>j, the constraintμf(ℓ)⩾μf(ℓ+1),ℓ>j, is also included in the model to meet the requirement that the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal ofDMℓshould be higher than that ofDMℓ+1. Finally, forDMj,j∈{2,3,…,k-1}, who desires to adjust their satisfaction degree based on the relative satisfaction ofDMj+1, the FGP model in the second phase is formulated as follows:(13.1)Min∑i=1kdf(i)-+∑i=1k-1∑ω=1nidx(iω)-+dx(iω)++dẼ(j,s″)-+dẼ(j,s″)++∑θ=1j-1dẼ(θ,s‴)-+dẼ(θ,s‴)+subject to(13.2)μf(i)+df(i)--df(i)+=1i=1,…,k(13.3)μx(iω)+dx(iω)--dx(iω)+=1i=1,…,k-1,ω=1,…,ni(13.4)μẼ(j,s″)+dẼ(j,s″)--dẼ(j,s″)+=1j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(13.5)μẼ(θ,s‴)+dẼ(θ,s‴)--dẼ(θ,s‴)+=1θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(13.6)μf(θ)⩾βθθ=1,…,j-1(13.7)μf(ℓ)⩾μf(ℓ+1)ℓ=j+1,…,k-1(13.8)df(i)-,df(i)+⩾0i=1,…,k(13.9)dx(iω)-,dx(iω)+⩾0i=1,…,k-1,ω=1,…,ni(13.10)dẼ(j,s″)-,dẼ(j,s″)+⩾0s″∈Sj(13.11)dẼ(θ,s‴)-,dẼ(θ,s‴)+⩾0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(13.12)x∈QαwheredẼ(j,s″)-/dẼ(θ,s‴)-anddẼ(j,s″)+/dẼ(θ,s‴)+denote the under- and over-deviation variables, respectively, for the relative satisfaction betweenDMj+1/DMθ+1andDMj/DMθ. Note that there areni(k-1)equations for constraints (13.3) and (13.9), respectively, one equation for constraint (13.4), and (j−1) equations for constraint (13.5).In model (13), the constraint for the relative satisfactionμẼ(j,s″)(orμẼ(θ,s‴))is fractionally formulated based on the definition in (11), making the model complex and difficult to solve. To enhance the computational efficiency of solving model (13), the method of variable change [16] is used to linearize the constraint. To simplify the notations,μẼ(i,s)+dẼ(i,s)--dẼ(i,s)+=1,i∈Ih,s∈Si, is used to carry out the linear transformations, as shown in the appendix. Using the definitions and notations in the appendix, the linearized constraints are expressed as follows:(14.1)Ci+1L-CiLx+DẼ(i,s)L--DẼ(i,s)L+=GisL″(14.2)Ci+1R-CiRx+DẼ(i,s)R--DẼ(i,s)R+=GisR″Moreover, to meet the boundary constraints of the deviation variables in model (13), i.e.,0⩽dẼ(i,s)L-,dẼ(i,s)L+,dẼ(i,s)R-,dẼ(i,s)R+⩽1, the transformed deviation variables in (14.1) and (14.2) are delimited as follows:(15.1)0⩽DẼ(i,s)L-/Fi(ci)αUx-Fi′⩽1(15.2)0⩽DẼ(i,s)L+/Fi(ci)αUx-Fi′⩽1(15.3)0⩽DẼ(i,s)R-/Fi(ci)αUx-Fi′⩽1(15.4)0⩽DẼ(i,s)R+/Fi(ci)αUx-Fi′⩽1The derivations of the above expressions are shown in the appendix. Using the notations in the linearization processes, forDMj,j∈Ih, the FGP model in the second phase is formulated as follows:(16.1)Min∑i=1kdf(i)-+∑i=1k-1∑ω=1nidx(iω)L-+dx(iω)L++dx(iω)R-+dx(iω)R++DẼ(j,s″)L-+DẼ(j,s″)L++DẼ(j,s″)R-+DẼ(j,s″)R++∑θ=1j-1DẼ(θ,s‴)L-+DẼ(θ,s‴)L++DẼ(θ,s‴)R-+DẼ(θ,s‴)R+subject to(16.2)(ci)αUx-fiWfiB-fiW+dfi--dfi+=1i=1,…,k(16.3)xiω-xiωB-qiωLqiωL+dx(iω)L--dx(iω)L+=1ω=1,…,ni,i=1,…,k-1(16.4)xiωB+qiωR-xiωqiωR+dx(iω)R--dx(iω)R+=1ω=1,…,ni,i=1,…,k-1(16.5)Cj+1L-CjLx+DẼ(j,s″)L--DẼ(j,s″)L+=Gj,s″L″j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.6)Cj+1R-CjRx+DẼ(j,s″)R--DẼ(j,s″)R+=Gj,s″R″j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.7)Cθ+1L-CθLx+DẼ(θ,s‴)L--DẼ(θ,s‴)L+=Gθ,s‴L″θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.8)Cθ+1R-CθRx+DẼ(θ,s‴)R--DẼ(θ,s‴)R+=Gθ,s‴R″θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.9)DẼ(j,s″)L--Fj(cj)αUx-Fj′⩽0j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.10)DẼ(j,s″)L+-Fj(cj)αUx-Fj′⩽0j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.11)DẼ(j,s″)R--Fj(cj)αUx-Fj′⩽0j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.12)DẼ(j,s″)R+-Fj(cj)αUx-Fj′⩽0j∈Ih,s″∈Sj(16.13)DẼ(θ,s‴)L--Fθ(cθ)αUx-Fθ′⩽0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.14)DẼ(θ,s‴)L+-Fθ(cθ)αUx-Fθ′⩽0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.15)DẼ(θ,s‴)R--Fθ(cθ)αUx-Fθ′⩽0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.16)DẼ(θ,s‴)R+-Fθ(cθ)αUx-Fθ′⩽0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.17)(cθ)αUx⩾βθfθB-fθW+fθWθ=1,…,j-1(16.18)(cℓ)αUx-fℓWfℓB-fℓW⩾(cℓ+1)αUx-fℓ+1Wfℓ+1B-fℓ+1Wℓ=j+1,…,k-1(16.19)df(i)-,df(i)+⩾0i=1,…,k(16.20)dx(iω)L-,dx(iω)L+,dx(iω)R-,dx(iω)R+⩾0ω=1,…,ni,i=1,…,k-1(16.21)DẼ(j,s″)L-,DẼ(j,s″)L+,DẼ(j,s″)R-,DẼ(j,s″)R+⩾0s″∈Sj(16.22)DẼ(θ,s‴)L-,DẼ(θ,s‴)L+,DẼ(θ,s‴)R+,DẼ(θ,s‴)R+⩾0θ=1,…,j-1,s‴∈Sθ(16.23)x∈QαNote that the constraintμf(θ)⩾βθin (13.6) is represented as(cθ)αUx⩾βθfθB-fθW+fθWin (16.7) based on the definition ofμf(θ). There areni(k-1)equations for constraints (16.3), (16.4), and (16.20), one equation for constraints (16.5), (16.6), (16.9), (16.10), (16.11) and (16.12), and (j−1) equations for constraints (16.7), (16.8), (16.13), (16.14), (16.15) and (16.16) respectively.Examining the satisfaction degree of the fuzzy goal fromDM1toDMk-1in sequence, the solution process is performed using the above model for each higher-level DM if adjustment is needed.In particular, model (16) in the second phase may not need to be applied when all higher-level DMs,DMi,i=1,…,k-1, satisfy the outcomes from the first phase.The solution procedure for solving MLLP problems using the proposed two-phase approach is described below.Solution procedure:Phase IStep 1:For the objective functionfi(x)ofDMi,i∈I, compute the individual maximumfiBusing (5) and the relative minimumfiWusing (6).

If the objective function value,∑δi, of model (10) is equal to zero, then go to Step 5; otherwise, either the considered problem cannot be treated as an MLLP problem investigated in this study, or use the FGP model (9) in Step 5, where the violated constraints,μf(i)⩽μf(i+1)for some i, are removed, and treat the outcomes as the final solutions.Establish the first-phase FGP model (9) with the constraintμf(i)⩾μf(i+1),i∈Ih, to determine the candidate satisfactory solutions for all DMs, which are examined by the higher-level DM in sequence in the second phase.Phase IIStep 6:Based on the fuzzy variableẼi,i∈Ih, of the relative satisfaction betweenDMiand their lower-level DM,DMi+1, set the upper and lower bounds of the relative satisfaction,piU=1andpiL=μf(i+1)(x¯i)/μf(i)(x¯i), respectively, wherex¯iis the solution that individually maximizesDMi’s objective functionfi(x), as defined in (5).Determine the setSicontaining the number of linguistic levels expressing the relative satisfaction forDMiandDMi+1,i∈Ih.

Ifj=k-1, then the adjustment process ends; otherwise,t=j+1, and go back to Step 10.This section demonstrates the proposed two-phase approach for MLLP problems with a numerical example. Another example is also provided to illustrate the case where the leader–follower relationship between some leader–follower levels cannot be found, and thus the requirement of a leader–follower relationship in terms of the satisfaction degree of fuzzy goals cannot be met. Comparisons with existing approaches are also presented to show the advantages of the proposed approach. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of theαlevel on the obtained results.Consider a three-level decision structure. The DM at each level,DMi,i=1,2,3, has one objective function to maximize, and only controls one decision variable,xi,i=1,2,3. The column vector of all the decision variables is denoted asx=(x1,x2,x3). The three-level linear programming problem is formulated as follows:(17)(level1)DM1:Maxf1(x)=(1,2,3)x1+(-1.4,-0.4,0.6)x2+(-1,0,1)x3(level2)DM2:Maxf2(x)=(-1,0,1)x1+(1,2,3)x2+(-1.4,-0.4,0.6)x3(level3)DM3:Maxf3(x)=(-0.2,0.8,1.8)x1+(-1,0,1)x2+(1,2,3)x3subject to(0.5,1,1.5)x1+(0.5,1,1.5)x2+(0.5,1,1.5)x3⩽(4.5,5,5.5)(0.5,1,1.5)x1+(-1.5,-1,-0.5)x2+(-1.5,-1,-0.5)x3⩽(1.5,2,2.5)(0.3,0.8,1.3)x1+(0.3,0.8,1.3)x2⩾(1.5,2,2.5)(-1.5,-1,-0.5)x1+(0.5,1,1.5)x2⩽(2.5,3,3.5)(0.5,1,1.5)x1+(-1.3,-0.8,-0.3)x2+(0.7,1.2,1.7)x3⩽(4.5,5,5.5)(1.5,2,2.5)x2+(1.5,2,2.5)x3⩽(4.5,5,5.5)x1,x2,x3⩾0Note that all parameters in the objective functions and constraints are expressed as symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers with spreads of 2 and 1, respectively, for this example. The spread of the fuzzy numbers can be specified in any way by the associated DM. Assume that anαlevel of 0.8 is accepted by the three DMs. Using the numerical MLLP model (4), the numerical model for (17) is expressed as follows:(18)(level1)DM1:Maxf1(x)=2.2x1-0.2x2+0.2x3(level2)DM2:Maxf2(x)=0.2x1+2.2x2-0.2x3(level3)DM3:Maxf3(x)=x1+0.2x2+2.2x3subject to0.9x1+0.9x2+0.9x3⩽5.10.9x1-1.1x2-1.1x3⩽2.10.9x1+0.9x2⩾1.9-1.1x1+0.9x2⩽3.10.9x1-0.9x2+1.1x3⩽5.11.9x2+1.9x3⩽5.1x1,x2,x3⩾0In the first phase, to formulate the fuzzy goals for the three DMs based on model (18), the individual maximumfiBand relative minimumfiWvalues of each objective function are first obtained to determine the aspiration levels and tolerance limits, respectively, of membership function (7) of the corresponding fuzzy goals. The values are shown in Table 1. ForDM1andDM2, the maximum solutions that producef1Bandf2Barex¯1=(4.17,0.15,1.35)andx¯2=(2.98,2.68,0), respectively. The algorithm attempts to keep the respective best decisionsx1B=4.17andx2B=2.68in the following resolution processes by considering them as the most likely values in constructing the membership functions (8) as the fuzzy goals of the decision variables in the model. In addition, the right and left tolerances ofx1andx2are simply specified asq1R=q2R=2andq1L=q2L=2, respectively. The pre-check model (10) is formulated and solved with the objective function value equal to zero, implying that the leader–follower relationship exists between any leader–follower levels. The first-phase FGP model (9) can then be formulated and solved to obtain the optimum solutionx=(4.1667,1.5,0)with the satisfaction degrees beingμf(1)=0.8403,μf(2)=0.5777, andμf(3)=0.1961for the three DMs, respectively. These satisfaction degrees meet the requirement of a hierarchical decision structure, and are considered as the initial reference solution in the second phase.In the second phase, five linguistic terms for the higher-level DMs (DM1andDM2), i.e.,v1=v2=5, namely “very low”, “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high”, are used to describe the relative satisfaction ofDM2compared to that ofDM1, and that ofDM3compared to that ofDM2. The measures of relative satisfactionp1andp2are delimited by the upper boundp1U=p2U=1and the lower boundp1L=p2L=0, which are determined based on the individual maximum solutionsx¯1andx¯2ofDM1andDM2, respectively. The most likely value for each linguistic term is then calculated, as shown in Table 2, to construct the membership function (11).ForDM1, the measure of the relative satisfaction ofDM2compared to that ofDM1isp1′=0.6875, and the linguistic levels=4, i.e., “high”, has the maximal membership degreeμẼ(1,4)max=0.7499, as obtained using (12). Assume thatDM1desires to increase the current satisfaction degreeμf(1)=0.8403of their fuzzy goal in the first phase by downgrading the linguistic level of the relative satisfaction ofDM2compared to their own from “high” (s=4)to “medium” (s=3). After solving the second-phase model (16), the solution isx=(4.1667,1.1766,0.3234)with satisfaction degrees ofμf(1)=0.8786,μf(2)=0.4393, andμf(3)=0.33for the three DMs, respectively, showing thatDM1’s satisfaction is effectively increased. Supposing thatDM1is satisfied with the new satisfaction degree, the following adjustment process is performed forDM2.Suppose thatDM2is willing to decrease their satisfaction degree, i.e.,μf(2)=0.4393;DM3’s satisfaction is thus expected to increase. According to the solutionx=(4.17,1.1766,0.3234)from the first level, the measure of the relative satisfaction ofDM3compared to that ofDM2isp2′=0.7588, and the linguistic levels=4, namely “high”, has the maximal membership degreeμẼ(2,4)max=0.9952, as obtained using (12). As such,DM2upgrades the level of the relative satisfaction ofDM3compared to their own from “high” (s=4)to “very high” (s=5). By solving model (16) with the constraints, includingDM1’s accepted satisfactionμf(1)⩾β1=0.8786, the level of the relative satisfaction ofDM2compared to that ofDM1, i.e., “medium”, and the level of the relative satisfaction ofDM3compared to that ofDM2, i.e., “very high”, the solution isx=(4.1426,1.0559,0.4683)with satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8786,μf(2)=0.3859, andμf(3)=0.3859for the three DMs, respectively, indicating that the satisfaction forDM3is improved at the expense ofDM2’s satisfaction. Suppose thatDM2is satisfied with this adjustment outcome. The solution procedure in the second phase terminates, with satisfactory solutions for the higher-level DMs having been obtained.As another demonstration of this approach, anαlevel of 0.5 is adopted for the above MLLP problem. Following the same procedure, the optimum solution in the first phase isx=(5.5,1.5,0)with satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8696,μf(2)=0.5192, andμf(3)=0.2222. In the second phase, based on the outcome from the first phase,DM1accepts their satisfaction degree of 0.8696, and thus the adjustment process goes toDM2. ForDM2, the relative satisfaction ofDM3compared to that ofDM2corresponds to the linguistic levels=3, i.e., “medium”. Suppose that the linguistic level is upgraded tos=5; the solution isx=(5.4269,1.1343,0.4388)with satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8696,μf(2)=0.3739, andμf(3)=0.3739. The process ends becauseDM2is satisfied with the results.This section considers an MLLP problem with five decision levels. EachDMi,i=1,2,…,5, controls one decision variable,xi,i=1,2,…,5. The column vector of all the decision variables is denoted asx=(x1,x2,…,x5). In this problem, two pairs of DMs, (DM1andDM3)and (DM2,DM4), have the same objective functions, andDM5’s maximum solution makesDM1’s objective function worst among the five individual maximum solutions. For simplification, based on (4), the numerical five-level MLLP problem at a certainαlevel is formulated as:(19)(level1)DM1:Maxf1(x)=2.2x1-0.2x2+0.2x3-0.1x4+0.1x5(level2)DM2:Maxf2(x)=x1+0.2x2+2.2x3-0.1x4(level3)DM3:Maxf3(x)=2.2x1-0.2x2+0.2x3-0.1x4+0.1x5(level4)DM4:Maxf4(x)=x1+0.2x2+2.2x3-0.1x4(level5)DM5:Maxf5(x)=0.2x1+2.2x2-0.2x3-0.1x4+0.2x5subject to0.9x1+0.9x2+0.9x3-0.1x4+0.1x5⩽10.10.9x1-1.1x2-1.1x3+0.1x5⩽10.10.9x1+0.9x2-0.1x4⩾1.9-1.1x1+0.9x2-0.1x5⩽10.10.9x1-0.9x2+1.1x3-0.1x4+0.1x5⩽12.11.9x2+1.9x3⩽11.1x1,x2,x3,x4,x5⩾0First, the maximum solutions of the objective functions are obtained asx¯1=x¯3=(18.3626,5.6199,0.2222,116.8421,0),x¯2=x¯4=(11.4938,0,0.2222,4.4444,0), andx¯5=(5.1579,5.8421,0,0,2), respectively. To establish membership function (7) of each DM’s fuzzy goal, the values of the aspiration levelfiBand tolerance limitfiWare determined, as shown in Table 3, wheref1W=f1(x¯5)becauseDM5’s maximum solution makes theDM1’s objective function the worst among the five individual maximum solutions. The maximum decision values for higher-level DMs arex1B=18.3626,x2B=0,x3B=0.2222, andx4B=4.4444, with the right and left tolerances,q1R=q2R=q3R=q4R=10andq1L=10,q2L=0,q3L=0.2222, andq4L=4.4444, respectively, to construct membership functions (8) of decision variables.The pre-check model (10) is formulated to examine this five-level MLLP problem. The objective function value from (10) is greater than zero, due to the following outcomes:δ1=0.0618,δ2=0,δ3=0.7175, andδ4=0. Obviously, the conditionsμf(1)⩾μf(2)andμf(3)⩾μf(4)are violated, so this problem cannot be categorized as the MLLP problem studied in this paper, since it is not possible to find a solution to keep the relevant leader–follower relationships. As an alternative choice, we may only keep the unviolated conditions, i.e.,μf(2)⩾μf(3)andμf(4)⩾μf(5), in the first-phase FGP model (9). The resulting solutionx=(11.4938,0,0.2222,4.4445,0)with the satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8408,μf(2)=1,μf(3)=0,μf(4)=1, andμf(5)=0could be adopted as the final solution for all the DMs.The proposed two-phase approach considers the inherent leader–follower relationship of DMs in a hierarchical decision process, ensuring that the fuzzy goal of a higher-level DM can reach a higher satisfaction degree than that of their lower-level DMs. In contrast, existing approaches [3,11,17,19–23,25] may not guarantee that the leader–follower constraint is met, even though the leader–follower relationships really exist, based on the results of the pre-check model (10). Pramanik and Roy [17] recently developed weighted/unweighted FGP models to solve MLLP problems, without considering the adjustment function for a higher-level DM. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach, the proposed model (9) in the first phase is compared to Pramanik and Roy’s models [17] with regard to solving the example, formulated as (18).In Section 4.1, the solution obtained using the first-phase model (9) wasx=(0.41667,1.5,0), with the satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8403,μf(2)=0.5777, andμf(3)=0.1961for the three DMs, respectively. The weighted and unweighted FGP models of Pramanik and Roy [17] both yield the solutionx=(0.41667,0.15,1.35), with the satisfaction degreesμf(1)=1,μf(2)=0, andμf(3)=0.7549for the three DMs, respectively. In this solution, the fuzzy goal ofDM3has a better satisfaction degree, i.e.,μf(3)=0.7549, compared to that ofDM2, i.e.,μf(2)=0, sinceDM3’s goal is relatively easy to satisfy when optimizing all the fuzzy goals. Unlike Pramanik and Roy’s models [17], the proposed first-phase model avoids such an undesired outcome.One advantage of the proposed approach is that an adjustment scheme is provided in the second phase to allow the higher-level DM (DMi) to tune their satisfaction degree by modifying the linguistic level of the relative satisfaction ofDMi+1to their own. In performing the higher-levelDMi’s adjustment process, the undesired outcome is effectively prevented because the membership functions of the linguistic terms are defined based on the relative satisfaction ofDMi+1toDMi, which is bounded up to one. In addition, the proposed approach is different from most existing interactive fuzzy approaches for MLLP problems [3,11,19–23,25] that carry out the adjustment of a higher-level DM’s satisfaction by intuitively setting the minimal acceptable satisfaction as the constraint in their models. To compare these two adjustment techniques, this section adopts model (18) of the example, where the solution x=(4.1667,1.1766,0.3234) and the associated satisfaction degreesμf(1)=0.8786,μf(2)=0.4393, andμf(3)=0.33were obtained afterDM1’s first adjustment process. For demonstration purposes, the fact thatDM1adjusts the satisfaction degree of their fuzzy goal is ignored, and it is assumed thatDM1desires to decrease their satisfaction degree, i.e.,μf(1)=0.8786, to increaseDM2’s satisfaction. As such, the linguistic level of the relative satisfaction ofDM2toDM1is increased from “medium” to “high” (or “very high”). The constraints (16.5) and (16.16) in the second-phase model (16) with j=1 are used to restrict the relative satisfaction ofDM2toDM1. For this adjustment, the existing approaches [3,11,19–23,25] adopt the concept of minimal acceptable satisfaction by setting the constraintμf(1)⩾λ, whereλdenotes the adjusted degree ofDM1’s minimal acceptable satisfaction, say 0.8, 0.7, or 0.6 in this case. In other words, the constraints (16.5) and (16.16) in the proposed second-phase model are replaced byμf(1)⩾λ.The results obtained using the two types of model are shown in Table 4, where A1 and A2 denote the proposed adjustment method and the existing techniques [3,11,19–23,25] based on minimal acceptable satisfaction, respectively. As shown in Table 4, the proposed method effectively decreases the satisfaction ofDM1toμf(1)=0.7984(orμf(1)=0.6655), and increases that ofDM2toμf(2)=0.5988(orμf(2)=0.6655). The existing techniques withλvalues of 0.8, 0.7, or 0.6 all yield the solutionμf(1)=0.8403. The satisfaction ofDM1remains unchanged, even if the minimal acceptable satisfaction is set to be lower than 0.8. This indicates that the effectiveness of the existing techniques may be limited, especially when such a higher-level DM desires to further decrease their satisfaction. These comparisons clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed two-phase fuzzy approach.To efficiently solve MLLP problems with fuzzy parameters, the numerical MLLP model is formulated at a givenαlevel in this study, since a fuzzy set can be fully and uniquely represented by itsα-cuts,α∈[0,1]. Based on the numerical MLLP model (4) at a givenαlevel, each objective function’s individual maximum,fiB, is obtained using (5), which is considered as the aspiration level to define the membership functions of the fuzzy goals. In addition, the minimal value,fiW, ofDMi’s objective function is determined using (6) based on the optimum solution of the higher-levelDMi-1’s objective function. Using the aspiration levelfiBand minimal valuefiW, the tolerance interval can be determined, and the membership functionμf(i)of the fuzzy goal for each DM is established using (7).Based on the definition ofα-cuts, a higherαlevel will make the feasible region in the numerical MLLP model (4) smaller, so that the aspiration levelfiBobtained from (5) will be lower. Table 5shows the aspiration levels of the three DMs in example (17) obtained using variousαlevels, indicating the impact of theαlevel on the aspiration level, the minimal valuefiW, and the membership functionμf(i). However, in general, a DM has a subjective aspiration level for their fuzzy goal. In practice, a modification of theαlevel may be needed to find an appropriate aspiration level. To this end, a feasible mechanism could be developed to determine an acceptableαlevel for all DMs. Using the established fuzzy goals, the proposed two-phase approach can be applied to determine the acceptable satisfaction degree of fuzzy goals and then to obtain a set of final solutions for DMs at various levels.
