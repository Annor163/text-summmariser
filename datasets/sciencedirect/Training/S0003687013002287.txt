@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Workplace violence is a leading form of occupational injury and fatality, but has received little attention from the ergonomics research community. The paper reports findings from the 2012 New Zealand Workplace Violence Survey, and examines the workplace violence experience of 86 New Zealand organisations and the perceptions of occupational health and safety professionals from a systems perspective. Over 50% of respondents reported violence cases in their organisation, with perpetrators evenly split between co-workers and external sources such as patients. Highest reported levels of violence were observed for agriculture, forestry and construction sectors. Highest risk factor ratings were reported for interpersonal and organisational factors, notably interpersonal communication, time pressure and workloads, with lowest ratings for environmental factors. A range of violence prevention measures were reported, although most organisations relied on single control measures, suggesting unmanaged violence risks were common among the sample.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A growing body of literature has examined the extent of workplace violence internationally (Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; Kelloway et al. 2006). At a time when other forms of violence in society appear to be on the decline, research suggests that workplace violence is increasing (Estrada et al., 2010), including violence as a leading form of occupational fatality (Menendez et al., 2013). This is reflected in the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work report (2010), which forecasted workplace violence to be one of the important emerging issues facing organisations.Despite a growing interest in this psychosocial phenomenon from researchers and international and national bodies concerned with safety and injury prevention, the ergonomics literature has largely ignored workplace violence to date. While ergonomics has contributed to the literature on other psychosocial risks – often in the context of musculoskeletal disorders and notably stress (e.g. Eatough et al., 2012), and working hours and fatigue (e.g. Bohle et al., 2011) – just two peer-reviewed articles on the problem of workplace violence were identified (using the search term combination: “work” “violence” AND “human factors” or “ergonomic* or “hfe”) from a search of Scopus for the period 2000-to date (March, 2013). These two articles were concerned with violence, bullying and other psychological risks among Turkish workers (Aytac et al., 2011) and violence and ergonomic prevention (Choe, 2000). Neither article applied a systems approach to the problem of workplace violence. During this period, more than 400 articles on the topic appeared in medicine journals and hundreds more in nursing, management and safety-related journals. Much of this literature on workplace violence dealt with descriptive epidemiology focusing on specific industry sectors, with few articles considering broader systemic concerns or focusing in more depth at risk factors and preventive measures. The absence of a contribution to the field by ergonomics is surprising as ergonomics, as a systems discipline, has an important role to play in understanding workplace violence risk and effective measures for its prevention. Like other occupational health and safety risks, violence in the workplace is related to the broad work system (rather than being a strictly interpersonal conflict problem) and can be understood in terms of interactions between individual, task, environment, and organisational work system elements. Moreover, the analysis and design of these system components are key to an effective violence prevention initiative.The present paper seeks to apply a systems approach to the study of violence in New Zealand workplaces, and in particular the analysis of violence control measures. Having first examined the extent and nature of violence cases in a sample of organisations from a wide range of New Zealand industry sectors, the paper explores health and safety managers' perceptions of risk for the different aspects of the work system, and current measures to manage risk amongst respondent's organisations from the perspective of a systems model of violence control.Workplace violence is a relatively recent consideration under New Zealand health and safety law. Introduced in 1992, the Health and Safety in Employment Act provided a more systematic approach to hazard management than existed previously under several laws. However, psychological harm and worker participation, two elements highly relevant to workplace violence, were not included in the Act until a 2002 amendment. Consequently, the profile of such psychosocial issues among industry and government agencies alike is still developing.Following a number of high profile incidents involving fatal and non-fatal cases of violence against New Zealand employees (Mayhew and Reilly, 2007), exploratory studies explored the extent and nature of violence at work across a range of New Zealand industry sectors (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). This initial research found relatively high levels of reported workplace violence across the range of surveyed organisations, but most notably in health and public administration workplaces. In the most recent survey (Bentley et al., 2013), a total of nearly 2500 cases of workplace violence were reported by 96 organisations with 436 cases involving some form of physical injury (18% of all reported cases). The incidence rate for all violence cases (32.3 per 1000 employees) was at the high end in relation to internationally reported rates, as the discussion below indicates. Highest violence incidence rates and lost-time due to violence injury were reported for organisations from the health sector.However, interpreting prevalence data must be treated with caution due to the considerable variation employed by researchers in the definitions, terminology and their operationalisation (Schat et al., 2006). Additionally, the concept of violence is itself often treated in an axiomatic fashion (Catley and Jones, 2002). Yet, the extent of workplace violence reported in international studies does suggest a significant concern in all countries where data on such events are available. Typically, a prevalence range of between 1.5% and 5% is observed for violence experienced by workforces surveyed, including 13 per 1000 in the US (Hartley et al., 2005); 2% of Canadian Public Service Employees (Kelloway et al., 2006), 5% of workers in Europe (Parent-Thirion et al., 2007), and 4.9% of UK workers (Jones et al., 2011).Employees at greatest risk of violence include those working in health, public administration, education, transportation and hospitality (Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2010; Gerberich et al., 2004; Gerberich et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2011; Kowalenko et al., 2013; Pompeii et al., 2013; Schat et al., 2006). Nurses and others working in health care and amongst hospital staff in particular appear to be the most vulnerable occupational groups for assaults from patients, visitors and others (Gerberich et al., 2004; Henry and Ginn, 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Pompeii et al., 2013). Consistent with these international findings, Bentley et al. (2013) and Catley et al. (2011) found that rates of workplace violence in New Zealand were notably higher among employees working in education, health, public transport and postal services.Counter to the stereotype that workplace violence is typically co-worker aggression, research indicates that the perpetrator of workplace violence is more likely to be – depending on industry – a patient, hospital visitor, client or customer (Barling et al., 2009; VandenBos and Bulatao, 1996; Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Gerberich et al., 2004; Hoobler and Swanberg, 2006; Jones et al., 2011; Jenkins, 1996; Kelloway et al., 2006; Laden and Schwartz, 2000; Pompeii et al., 2013; Schat et al., 2006). These international findings were supported by the previous surveys conducted by the present authors in New Zealand, with highest risk ratings for non-employee perpetrators, although this varied by industry sector (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). Health organisations rated patients, customers/clients, and family members as particularly important potential sources of violence, while in education patients and students were highest rated. Although workplace violence is often represented as being about co-worker aggression, co-workers were rated highest for only two industry sectors: ‘manufacturing and professional’ and ‘scientific and technical services’. Highest risk factor ratings (as perceived by occupational health and safety managers and others responsible for managing workplace violence) were reported for exposure to unstable persons, including: alcohol and drug use, prejudice and/or harassment, and mental instability/distress.The extent of the workplace violence problem and its impact on individual workers and organisations has led to a considerable body of epidemiological research literature that has investigated risk factors for workplace violence. However, rather less research attention has been focused on measures to prevent violence at work (Campbell et al., 2011; Chappell and Di Martino, 2006; May and Grubbs, 2002). Chappell and Di Martino's (2006) conceptual systems model is particularly useful in assisting in risk assessment as it depicts the interactive role of individual, workplace, contextual and societal risk factors in the aetiology of workplace violence events. This model has provided a basis for the collection of risk factor data in the previous New Zealand surveys, with a range of individual and organisation risk factors identified as of key importance by respondents. Previous New Zealand studies (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011) have found highest risk factor ratings for individual factors, including exposure to unstable persons, although, interestingly, workloads and time pressure also received relatively high ratings, suggesting poorly organised work and work-related stress increases the perceived risk of violence in the workplace. Indeed, research has indicated that stress can lead to the breakdown of workplace relationships and increase violence risk, while factors such as competition for scarce resources, work intensification and constant change can be important antecedents for workplace violence (Hoad, 1993; Howard and Wech, 2012; Jones et al., 2011).The present study draws on the Chappell and Di Martino (2006) systems model to determine the relative contribution of risk factors in the experience of workplace violence in New Zealand. Moreover, it attempts to understand the violence prevention measures employed by New Zealand organisations from different industry sectors and relates the control options available to managers according to Catley et al.’s (2011) conceptual systems model. The model includes four key control dimensions that may be available as a violence control measure to organisations from different sectors: (1) behaviour – managing the behaviour of people in and around the workplace; (2) technology – including surveillance and other technology solutions; (3) administrative controls – notably shift scheduling and workload management; and (4) environmental design – including factors such as the use of lighting, barriers to isolate vulnerable employees from dangerous situations, and workplace layout and design factors. Supporting each of these control dimensions is the organisation's health and safety culture – principally, a shared understanding of the workplace violence risk and how to manage it, and a communicated commitment at the top of the organisation to prioritise violence control. These control dimensions are shown in Fig. 1, from the perspective of the control of violence risk to taxi drivers, and as a comparison, retail shop workers. The degree of overlap with the larger circle for each of the four violence measures corresponds to the ability to control each dimension for each sector. In the case of taxi drivers, little control can be exerted over the external environment and work organisation and therefore control activity needs to focus on the other control measures such as technology. This has been well-illustrated in New Zealand where, following a fatal knife attack on a taxi driver, all cabs are legally required to be fitted with a surveillance camera. The presence of cameras has reduced the incidence of attacks on taxi drivers, acting as a deterrent for passengers considering a verbal or physical attack on the driver. For retail workers, all four dimensions of control can be applied, as the working environment for retail staff is restricted to the store, and technology in the form of surveillance cameras and panic buttons can be readily applied. These factors will in turn influence customer behaviour, reducing the risk of violence from an external source further. Work organisation, such as ensuring workers are not roistered on late shifts alone, will further reduce the violence risk.There is little published research on organisational attempts to manage the workplace violence problem (Bentley et al., 2013; Dillon, 2012; Wassell, 2009); although the literature that is available suggests that current violence management prevention is inadequate. Dillon (2012), from a review of the literature, reports that nearly 70% of US organisations have no programs or policies to deal with violence. Previous New Zealand studies by the present authors have found just 50% of organisations formally recognised violence as a hazard in the workplace, and many organisations did not formally address violence as part of their risk management activity (Bentley et al., 2013; Catley et al., 2011). The present study seeks to add to this meagre literature by focusing on the prevention activities to control workplace violence used by organisations from the different sectors responding to the survey. Moreover, it considers the use of the different control dimensions depicted in Fig. 1.The present study, in common with its predecessors, aims to examine the extent and nature of the workplace violence problem in a sample of New Zealand organisations, towards the on-going development of a biennial workplace violence survey that can assist government and industry in monitoring the workplace violence problem, identify key areas of risk and develop interventions that target these areas.The study had four specific aims:i)to determine the extent and nature of cases of workplace violence (including assault on both people and property) among a sample of New Zealand organisations from a variety of industry sectorsto identify the major perceived sources of violence/perpetrators for participating industry sectorsto identify perceived key risk factors for workplace violence, in relation to a systems model, from the perspective of different sectorsto examine workplace violence control measures presently employed by participating organisations and relate these measures to a systems control model.
