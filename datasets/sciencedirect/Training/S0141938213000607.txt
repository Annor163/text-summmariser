@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Two novel carbazole/anthracene hybrided molecules, namely 2-(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (AnCz) and 2,7-di(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (2AnCz), were designed and synthesized via palladium catalyzed coupling reaction. The anthracene was attached either at the 2-site (AnCz) or at both 2,7-sites (2AnCz) of the central carbazole core to tune the conjugation state and the optoelectronic properties of the resultant molecules. Both of them show good solubility in common organic solvents. They also possess relatively high HOMO levels (−5.39eV, −5.40eV) that would facilitate efficient hole injection and be favorable for high power efficiencies when used in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). AnCz and 2AnCz were used as non-doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by vacuum evaporation. Good performance was achieved with maximum luminance efficiency of 2.61cdA−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.12) for AnCz, and 9.52cdA−1 and (0.22, 0.37) for 2AnCz.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of their promising applications in full-color, large-area flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting [1,2]. Compared to green-light-emitting materials, many efforts are still needed to further improve the performance of blue-light-emitting materials, particularly in terms of luminescent efficiency and color purity [3]. In recent years, much progress has been made to improve deep blue electroluminescence (EL) color with a Commisssion Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIEy) coordinate value of y<0.15 [4,5]. Non-doped OLEDs fabricated with host emitters which bear proper charge transporting ability are apparently advantageous in terms of ease of device fabrication, low cost especially in mass production, and absence of phase separation or spectra shift with driving voltage. Among the three primary color emitting materials, blue host emitters are especially more significant than other two color ones. Based on their high excited energies, excellent blue-light-emitting materials can not only effectively reduce the power consumption of a full-color OLED panel, but also be served as hosts for exothermic energy transfer to lower-energy fluorophores to facilitate efficient white and other color emission [6]. In fact, the large-band-gap host materials are relatively rare and always keep as one of the most challenging targets of OLED research. It is thus important to develop high-performance blue-light-emitting materials with good stability and high fluorescent efficiency. Maintaining efficient carrier injection in the light-emitting device is also considered to be a significant issue for achieving high device performance.In this paper, we report the synthesis and luminescent properties of two novel carbazole-based deep blue emitters with anthracene endcaps, namely AnCz and 2AnCz (Scheme 1). Carbazole-based materials have been well known for their excellent thermal stability, hole transporting properties, versatile structural derivatization, and unique ability to form amorphous film [7]. Anthracene is important building block to construct blue luminescent dyes due to its merits such as the excellent fluorescent quantum yield, thermal and electrochemical stability, and ease to be modified [5]. Herein, we select carbazole as the core and anthracene as the end caps at the C2 or C2,7 positions of carbazole. Qiu et al. reported a series of solution-processible carbazole-based host materials, and demonstrated that the 2,7-substituted carbazole compounds show hypsochromic shift in photoluminescence compared to the 3,6-substituted carbazole analogues. We select the carbazole as the core and 9-naphthylanthracene as the end caps at the C2 and C7 positions of carbazole with the expectation to construct true blue emissive materials by this unique linkage mode [8,9]. Furthermore, these molecules are well soluble due to the alkyl substituents at the N9 position of carbazole moieties. The blue OLEDs containing AnCz and 2AnCz as a non-doped emitter show luminance efficiency of 2.61cdA−1 with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.12).The synthetic routes for the carbazole-cored derivatives with anthracene endcaps (AnCz, 2AnCz) are shown in Scheme 1. They were prepared by C–C coupling reaction of the boronic acid of the anthracene endcaps (7) and the brominated carbazole core (3 or 6). First, the important intermediates for the synthesis of these target molecules, including anthracene-9-boronic acid (7) [8], 2-bromo-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (3) and 2,7-dibromo-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (6) [10,11], were synthesized according to literature methods, as described in Scheme 1. Finally the target compounds AnCz and 2AnCz were prepared at a high yield of 90% and 60% by Suzuki coupling reactions of the boronic acid 7 with the brominated carbazole 3 and 6, respectively. All the products are highly soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, or toluene and were purified conveniently by column chromatograph and recrystallization to an excellent purity for OLEDs application. The chemical structures of AnCz and 2AnCz were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (TOF-MS-EI), and elemental analysis.2-(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (AnCz): A mixture of 7 (486mg, 2.19mmol), 3 (500mg, 1.82mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (105mg, 0.091mmol) in toluene (15mL) and 2M aqueous Na2CO3 solution (4.6mL, 9.2mmol) was degassed by pump. The solution was heated at 80°C for 18h under argon. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, dichloromethane and water were added. The organic layer was separated and washed with diluted HCl and brine, then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by column chromatograpy over silica gel with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (5:1) as the eluent to give AnCz as a light yellow solid (609mg, 90% yield). 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.52 (s, 1H; ArH), 8.29 (d, J=8.0Hz, 1H; ArH), 8.22 (d, J=8.0Hz, 1H; ArH), 8.08 (d, J=12.0Hz, 2H; ArH), 7.75 (d, J=8.0Hz, 2H; ArH), 7.52–7.44 (m, 5H; ArH), 7.35–7.28 (m, 4H; ArH), 4.34 (q, 2H; CH2), 1.40 (t, J=8.0Hz, 3H; CH3); MS (TOF-MS-EI, m/z): calcd. for C28H21N 371.47, found 371.17. Anal. calcd. for C28H21N: C, 90.53; H, 5.70; N, 3.77. Found: C, 90.17; H, 5.91; N, 3.91.2,7-di(anthracen-9-yl)-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (2AnCz):2AnCz was prepared according to the method used for AnCz by using 7 (453mg, 2.04mmol), 6 (300mg, 0.85mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (98mg, 0.085mmol) in toluene (15mL) and 2M aqueous Na2CO3 solution (4.25mL, 8.5mmol). The crude product was purified by column chromatograpy over silica gel with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (4:1) as the eluent to give 2AnCz as a light yellow solid (265mg, 60% yield). 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.55 (s, 2H; ArH), 8.41 (d, J=8.0Hz, 2H; ArH), 8.10 (d, J=8.0Hz, 4H; ArH), 7.80 (d, J=12.0Hz, 4H; ArH), 7.55 (s, 2H; ArH), 7.50–7.47 (t, J=8.0Hz, 4H; ArH), 7.40–7.34 (q, 6H; ArH), 4.34 (q, 2H; CH2), 1.40 (t, J=8.0Hz, 3H; CH3); MS (TOF-MS-EI, m/z): calcd. for C28H21N 547.69, found 547.23. Anal. calcd. for C42H29N: C, 92.11; H, 5.34; N, 2.56. Found: C, 92.47; H, 5.11; N, 2.42.Thermogravimetry analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out using a Perkin–Elmer thermogravimeter (Model TGA7) and a Netzsch DSC 204 at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. The UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of AnCz and 2AnCz were measured in CH2Cl2 solutions and the solid films on quartz plate. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined against quinine sulfate as the standard (Φ=0.55, in 0.1N H2SO4) [12]. Electrochemical measurements were made by using a conventional three-electrode configuration and an electrochemical workstation (BAS 100B, USA) at a scan rate of 100mVs−1. A glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt-wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode were used. All measurements were made at room temperature on samples dissolved in dichloromethane, with 0.1M tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NPF6) as the electrolyte, ferrocene as the internal standard [13].The patterned ITO substrates were cleaned by successive ultrasonications in detergent, deionized water, ethanol, and dichloromethane, followed by treatment with UV–Ozone for 20min. PEDOT/PSS (Bayer AG) was spin-coated on pre-treated ITO substrates from aqueous dispersion and baked at 120°C for 40min in air. All the organic layers were deposited by vacuum evaporation in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure less than 10−6torr. The cathode was completed through thermal deposition of LiF (1nm) and then capping with Al metal (100nm). The emitting area of each pixel is determined by overlapping of the two electrodes as 9mm2. The EL spectra, CIE coordinates, and current–voltage–luminance relationships of devices were measured with computer-controlled Spectrascan PR 705 photometer and a Keithley 236 source-measure-unit. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions.
