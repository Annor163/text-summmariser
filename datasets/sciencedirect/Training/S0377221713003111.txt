@&#ABSTRACT@&#
One of the most important issues for aggregating preferences rankings is the determination of the weights associated with the different ranking places. To avoid the subjectivity in determining the weights, Cook and Kress (1990) [5] suggested evaluating each candidate with the most favorable scoring vector for him/her. With this purpose, various models based on Data Envelopment Analysis have appeared in the literature. Although these methods do not require predetermine the weights subjectively, some of them have a serious drawback: the relative order between two candidates may be altered when the number of first, second, …, kth ranks obtained by other candidates changes, although there is not any variation in the number of first, second, …, kth ranks obtained by both candidates. In this paper we propose a model that allows each candidate to be evaluated with the most favorable weighting vector for him/her and avoids the previous drawback. Moreover, in some cases, we give a closed expression for the score assigned with our model to each candidate.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper deals with voting systems in which each voter (of a collective of n individuals) selects k candidates from a set of m candidates, {A1,…,Am}, and ranks them from top to kth place. In this context, scoring rules are well-known systems to get a social ranking or a winning candidate. These procedures are based on fixed scores, which are assigned to the different ranks obtained by the candidates. Thus, the score obtained by the candidate AiisZi=∑j=1kvijwj, where vijis the number of jth place ranks that candidate Aioccupies and (w1,…,wk) is the scoring vector used. Once the scores are obtained for all candidates, they are ordered according to these scores. The plurality rule, where w1=1 and wj=0 for all j∈{2,…,k}, and the Borda rule, where k=m and wj=m−j for all j∈{1,…,m}, are possibly the best known examples of scoring rules.One of the most important issues in the field of scoring rules is the determination of the scoring vector to use, because a candidate that is not the winner with the scoring vector imposed initially could be it if another one is used. For instance, the Formula One World Championship uses k=10 and the scoring vector (25,18,15,12,10,8,6,4,2,1) for obtaining the winner of the championship. In 2010, the winner was Sebastian Vettel, followed by Fernando Alonso. However, if the scoring vector utilized in the Motorcycle World Championship had been used, (w1,…,w15)=(25,20,16,13,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1), then the winner would have been Fernando Alonso.To avoid this problem, Cook and Kress [5] suggested evaluating each candidate with the most favorable scoring vector for him/her. With this purpose, they introduced Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in this context. The model DEA/AR proposed by these authors is(1)Zo∗(ε)=max∑j=1kvojwj,s.t.∑j=1kvijwj⩽1,i=1,…,m,wj-wj+1⩾d(j,ε),j=1,…,k-1,wk⩾d(k,ε),where ε⩾0 and the functions d(j,ε), called the discrimination intensity functions, are nonnegative and nondecreasing in ε. Furthermore, d(j,0)=0 for all j∈{1,…,k}.The principal drawback of this procedure is that several candidates are often efficient, i.e., they achieve the maximum attainable score (Zo∗=1). To avoid this weakness, Cook and Kress [5] proposed to maximize the gap between consecutive weights of the scoring vector and, in this way, to reduce the feasible set of Problem (1). Thus, the model considered by these authors is(2b)maxε,s.t.∑j=1kvijwj⩽1,i=1,…,m,(a)wj-wj+1⩾d(j,ε),j=1,…,k-1,(b)wk⩾d(k,ε),where ε and the functions d(j,ε) satisfy the conditions imposed in Model (1). Cook and Kress [5] demonstrated that, at optimality, at least one of the constraints in (2a) and all the constraints in (2b) hold as equalities. The candidate(s) Aifor which∑j=1kvijwj=1are the winning candidates (see Cook and Kress [5, p. 1308]). The candidate(s) in second place can be found by re-solving Model (2) after deleting the binding constraint(s) from (2a). This process can be repeated until the order of all candidates is fixed.Since all the constraints in (2b) hold as equalities, Model (2) can be written as(3)maxε,s.t.∑j=1k∑l=jkd(l,ε)vij⩽1,i=1,…,m,ε⩾0.Cook and Kress [5] gave a closed form solution for this model when d(j,ε)=g(j)h(ε) and h(ε) is strictly monotonic increasing. Later, Green et al. [10] noticed that, in this case, the previous procedure amounts to the scoring rule given by the weightswj=∑l=jkg(l). In the general case, this result is true when we only seek the winning candidates; that is, regardless of the discrimination intensity functions used, the winning candidates provided by Model (3) are the same as those obtained with a scoring rule: if ε∗ is the optimum value of Model (3), the winning candidates are those that, at optimality, satisfy∑j=1k∑l=jkd(l,ε∗)vij=1.Therefore, they are the same candidates than those obtained with the scoring rules given bywj=∑l=jkd(l,ε∗). Consequently, when Model (3) is used, the aim pursued by Cook and Kress [5] (evaluating each candidate with the most favorable scoring vector for him/her) is not reached.Since the pioneering work of Cook and Kress [5], several models have appeared in the literature in order to deal with this kind of problems (see [10,11,16,17,12,8,9,21–23,20,24,1,18,4,13,6,14,7]). A thorough analysis of some of them can be found in Llamazares and Peña [15]. In this work the authors show that an important shortcoming of some of these models is that the relative order between two candidates may be altered when the number of first, second, …, kth ranks obtained by other candidates changes, although there is not any variation in the number of first, second, …, kth ranks obtained by both candidates. It is worth noting that this behavior is very questionable from the point of view of Social Choice Theory.In this paper we propose a model that avoids the previous problem. To do this, from Cook and Kress’s model, we put together in a single restriction the constraints of the candidates that are not being evaluated (Section 2). The main shortcoming of this initial model is that several candidates could be winners. In Section 3 we solve this problem by removing in the initial model the constraint of the evaluated candidate. On the other hand, in this aggregating preferences rankings’ framework, the models that use non-null discrimination intensity functions have the following drawback: it is necessary to choose a specific value for ε and the winner may change depending on the value of ε. To avoid this problem, in Section 4 we consider the average of the function that provides, for each value of ε, the score obtained for each candidate. Moreover, for some specific values of d(j,ε), we give a closed expression for the scores assigned to the candidates. These expressions allow us to get the winning candidates without solving the proposed model. Finally, some concluding remarks are made in Section 5.The initial model that we propose is based on that of Cook and Kress [5] but putting together in a single restriction the constraints of the candidates that are not being evaluated. So, we replace the constraints relative to the candidates that are not being evaluated,∑j=1kwjvij⩽1i=1,…,m,i≠o,by their sum,∑i=1i≠om∑j=1kwjvij⩽m-1.Since∑i=1i≠om∑j=1kwjvij=∑j=1kwj∑i=1i≠omvij,and vojis the number of jth place ranks that candidate Aooccupies, the number of jth place ranks obtained by the remaining candidates is n−voj, where n is the number of voters. Therefore, the sum constraint can be written as follows:∑j=1kwj(n-voj)⩽m-1,and the model proposed is(4)Θo∗=max∑j=1kvojwj,s.t.∑j=1kvojwj⩽1,∑j=1k(n-voj)wj⩽m-1,wj-wj+1⩾d(j,ε),j=1,…,k-1,wk⩾d(k,ε).It is worth noting that the constraint∑j=1k(n-voj)wj⩽m-1(and then the feasible set of Model (4)) do not change when the number of ranks obtained by the candidates that are not being evaluated at that moment is altered. So, the score obtained by each candidate (and therefore the relative order between two candidates) do not depend on the individual evaluations of the remaining candidates.Note that, for the sake of simplicity, we have usedΘo∗instead ofΘo∗(ε). Moreover, in order to facilitate the analysis of this model, in the following lemma we give an alternative representation of it.Lemma 1Model(4)can be expressed asΘo∗=max∑j=1kVojWj+∑j=1kVojd(j,ε),s.t.∑j=1kVojWj+∑j=1kVojd(j,ε)⩽1,∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj+∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε)⩽m-1,Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k,whereWj=wj-wj+1-d(j,ε),forallj∈{1,…,k-1},Wk=wk-d(k,ε),Voj=∑l=1jvol,forallj∈{1,…,k}.It is worth noting that the valuesVoj=∑l=1jvolare called cumulative standing (see, for instance, Green et al. [10] and Stein et al. [19]), and that satisfy 0⩽Vo1⩽⋯⩽Vok⩽n.Now, if we considerδo1=1-∑j=1kVojd(j,ε),δo2=(m-1)-∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε),the previous model can be written as(5)Θo∗=max∑j=1kVojWj+(1-δo1),s.t.∑j=1kVojWj⩽δo1,∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj⩽δo2,Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k.In order to guarantee that the above problem is feasible, we need to impose the conditions δo1⩾0 and δo2⩾0. Moreover, it is worth noting that the feasible set of the previous model varies according to the evaluated candidate. Therefore, if we want that all the feasible sets are non-empty, we need that mino=1,…,mδo1⩾0 and mino=1,…,mδo2⩾0.In the following theorem we give the optimal value for Model (5).Theorem 1Consider Model(5). The following statements hold:1.If Vo1=n, thenΘo∗=1.If Vo1<n, thenΘo∗=1-(δo1-δo2Vo∗)ifδo2=0orδo1/δo2>Vo∗,1ifδo1/δo2⩽Vo∗,whereVo∗=maxj=1,…,kVoj/(jn-Voj).The main shortcoming of this model is that usually provides more of one winning candidate. For instance, consider d(j,ε)=0 for all j∈{1,…,k}. Then δo1=1 and δo2=m−1. According to Theorem 1, the winning candidates are those that Vo1=n orVo∗⩾1/(m-1). This fact may produce unfair outcomes for some candidates. For instance, consider k⩾2 and two or more candidates where one of them, A, obtains all the first ranks and another, B, gets all the second ranks. ObviouslyΘA∗=1and, given thatVB∗=1⩾1/(m-1), we also haveΘB∗=1. Therefore, both are winning candidates although it seems logical to think that candidate A should be the winner.Multiple winning candidates also appear when we consider non-null discrimination intensity functions. For instance, consider Table 1, taken from Cook and Kress [5, p. 1309], and the following discrimination intensity functions (also considered by them): d(j,ε)=ε, d(j,ε)=ε/j and d(j,ε)=ε/j!.For each candidate, we show in Table 2the valueVo∗, and also the values δo1/δo2 for each family of discrimination intensity functions considering two values of ε. One of them is the maximum value that we can take in order to both mino=1,…,mδo1 and mino=1,…,mδo2 be greater than or equal to zero; and the other is a value close to the half of the previous one.When d(j,ε)=0 for all j∈{1,…,4}, δo1/δo2=0.2 for all candidates. Therefore, the winning candidates are A, B, C and D. When the discrimination intensity functions are not null, B, C and D continue to be winning candidates in all considered cases. This shortcoming of multiple winning candidates is solved in the next section.As we have seen in the previous section, it is usual that several candidates achieve the maximum score when Model (5) is applied. One possibility to avoid this fact is to remove the constraint relative to the evaluated candidate. This procedure is the same as that used in the DEA exclusion method (see Andersen and Petersen [2] and, in this context, Hashimoto [11]). Therefore, the model proposed is(6)Λo∗=max∑j=1kvojwj,s.t.∑j=1k(n-voj)wj⩽m-1,wj-wj+1⩾d(j,ε),j=1,…,k-1,wk⩾d(k,ε).If, as in the previous section, we consider Wj=wj−wj+1−d(j,ε) for all j∈{1,…,k−1}, Wk=wk−d(k,ε) andVoj=∑l=1jvolfor all j∈{1,…,k}, then Model (6) becomesΛo∗=max∑j=1kVojWj+∑j=1kVojd(j,ε),s.t.∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj+∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε)⩽m-1,Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k.Moreover, if we putδo=∑j=1kVojd(j,ε),δo2=(m-1)-∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε),the previous model can be written as(7)Λo∗=max∑j=1kVojWj+δo,s.t.∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj⩽δo2,Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k.The condition δo2⩾0 is necessary in order to ensure that the above problem is feasible. As in Model (5), the feasible set varies according to the evaluated candidate. So, in order to all the feasible sets are non-empty we need that mino=1,…,mδo2⩾0.When Vo1=n, then Vo2=⋯=Vok=n and the feasible set isS=(W1,…,Wk)∈R+k|nW2+2nW3+⋯+(k-1)nWk⩽δo2.Therefore Model (7) is unbounded and, consequently, candidate Aois the winner. In the following theorem we give the optimal value of this program for the remaining cases.Theorem 2Consider Model(7)when Vo1<n. ThenΛo∗=δo2Vo∗+δo, whereVo∗=maxj=1,…,kVoj/(jn-Voj).It is worth noting that the value ofΛo∗coincides with that ofΘo∗when δo2=0 orδo1/δo2>Vo∗. So, the valueδo2Vo∗+δocan be seen as a natural way to break ties in Model (5).In the following subsections we analyze the proposed model according to whether the discrimination intensity functions are null or not.Consider d(j,ε)=0 for all j∈{1,…,k}. In this case δo=0, δo2=m−1 and Model (7) becomes(8)Λo∗=max∑j=1kVojWj,s.t.∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj⩽m-1,Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k.By Theorem 2, if Vo1<n, the score obtained by the candidate AoisΛo∗=(m-1)maxj=1,…,kVojjn-Voj.Let Aoand Aibe two candidates such that Vo1<n and Vi1<n. Given thatVojjn-Voj>Villn-Vil⇔Voj(ln-Vil)>Vil(jn-Voj)⇔Vojl>Vilj⇔Vojj>Villfor all j, l∈{1,…,k}, we have(9)Λo∗>Λi∗⇔maxj=1,…,kVojj>maxj=1,…,kVijj.On the other hand, if Aois a candidate such that Vo1=n, thenn=maxj=1,…,kVoj/j>maxj=1,…,kVij/jfor all i≠o; that is, Aois also the winner when we consider the scoremaxj=1,…,kVoj/j. Taking into account the previous remarks, the rank given by Model (8) is the same as obtained using the expressionZ^o=maxj=1,…,kVoj/j, which is simpler. This value,Z^o, is used to determine the winning candidate when we take the L1-norm and d(j,ε)=0 in the model given by Obata and Ishii [17] (see [15, p. 720]).It is worth noting that the winning candidate obtained with this model may be, in some cases, less controversial than that obtained with other procedures. For instance, consider Table 3, where it is shown the number of first, second, third and fourth ranks obtained by four candidates.If we apply the Borda rule, which is superior in many respects to other scoring rules (see, for instance, [3, p. 216]), the following scores are obtained:ZA=17,ZB=17,ZC=2,ZD=18.Therefore, candidate D is the winner despite not getting any first rank. However, when Model (8) is applied for each of the four candidates, and taking into account the equivalence (9), the following rank is obtained:A≻D≻B≻C.Note that candidate A is the Condorcet winner (that is, a candidate that pairwise defeats every other candidate) since he/she has obtained more than half of the first ranks. As we show in the following proposition, Model (8) guarantees this property: if a candidate receives more than half of the first ranks, then he/she is the winner.Proposition 1Let Aobe a candidate such that vo1>n/2. Then Ao≻Aifor all i≠o.When the discrimination intensity functions are not null we have to fix the value of ε, as well as choose these functions. Moreover, as we shall see below, the choice of this value may determine the winning candidate.Note that, although to simplify the notation we have usedΛo∗,δoand δo2, these values are actually functions ofε,Λo∗(ε),δo(ε)and δo2(ε). Furthermore, since the functions d(j,ε) are nondecreasing in ε, the feasible set of Model (6) (or, equivalently, the feasible set of Model (7)) does not increase when the value of ε increases. ThereforeΛo∗(ε)is a nonincreasing function; that is, if ε1>ε2, thenΛo∗(ε1)⩽Λo∗(ε2).Consider, for instance, d(j,ε)=ε for all j∈{1,…,k}. Thenδo(ε)=ε∑j=1kVojandδo2(ε)=(m-1)+ε∑j=1kVoj-nk(k+1)2.According to Theorem 2, we haveΛo∗(ε)=(m-1)Vo∗+εVo∗+1∑j=1kVoj-Vo∗nk(k+1)2,that is, the graph ofΛo∗(ε)is a straight line. Moreover, sinceΛo∗(ε)is a nonincreasing function, the slope of this straight line is negative or null.Consider now the example given by Table 1. In this caseΛo∗(ε)=5Vo∗+εVo∗+1∑j=14Voj-200Vo∗.When we focus on candidates B and D we haveΛB∗(ε)=3523-11023ε,ΛD∗(ε)=157-2007ε.Both functions appear drawn in Fig. 1(Note that we have considered different scales on both axes; a hundredth on the x-axis is equal to one unit on the y-axis).As we can see in Fig. 1, when we take values of ε less than 10/383 we have D≻B. However, if the values of ε are greater than 10/383, then B≻D. In Table 4we show this behavior for two specific values of ε, ε=0.01 and ε=5/178. This last value is the maximum possible value for ε, that is, the maximum value for which mino=1,…,mδo2(ε)⩾0.Therefore, it is not obvious how to choose a specific value of ε. One possibility would be to always take the maximum possible value for ε (in the same spirit that in Cook and Kress’ model), although in the previous example (see Fig. 1), it does seem the best choice. On the other hand, this solution has a serious shortcoming: the order between two candidates may depend on the ranks obtained by other candidates. For instance, suppose that candidates A, E and F obtain the ranks shown in Table 5, which are different from those shown in Table 1. Now, the maximum possible value for ε is 5/194, and, with this value, D≻B (ΛB∗(ε)andΛD∗(ε)are still the functions of Fig. 1 and 5/194<10/383; see also Table 5).A solution to avoid taking a fixed value of ε is to consider the average of the functionsΛo∗(ε). Moreover, for each candidate Aowe only consider the constraint δo2(ε)⩾0 instead of the restriction mino=1,…,mδo2(ε)⩾0. This prevents that the average of the functionΛo∗(ε)may depend on the results obtained for the remaining candidates. This proposal will be developed in the next section.Consider again Model (7):(10)Λo∗(ε)=max∑j=1kVojWj+δo(ε),s.t.∑j=1k(jn-Voj)Wj⩽δo2(ε),Wj⩾0,j=1,…,k,whereδo(ε)=∑j=1kVojd(j,ε),δo2(ε)=(m-1)-∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε).We have seen that when Vo1=n, then the candidate Aois the winner. On the other hand, if Voj=0 for all j∈{1,…,k}, thenΛo∗(ε)=0for all ε⩾0.Consider now the remaining cases. When d(j,ε)=0 for all j∈{1,…,k}, we know, from Section 3.1, thatΛo∗(ε)=(m-1)maxj=1,…,kVojjn-Voj,that is,Λo∗(ε)does not depend on ε. If d(j,ε) is not null for some j∈{1,…,k}, Model (10) is feasible if and only if δo2(ε)⩾0. Since δo2(ε) is a nonincreasing function (because d(j,ε) are nondecreasing in ε), we can consider the maximum value for which the feasible set is non-empty, that is,εo∗=sup{ε⩾0|δo2(ε)⩾0}.Once known the value ofεo∗, the score assigned to the candidate AoisΛ^o=1εo∗∫0εo∗Λo∗(ε)dε,that is, the average of the functionΛo∗(ε)(on the assumption that this value exists). Obviously, ifεo∗=0, then we considerΛ^o=Λo∗(0). Moreover, note that the value ofεo∗may not be finite. In this case, the value ofΛ^ocould be defined asΛ^o=limb→∞1b∫0bΛo∗(ε)dε.In any case, from now on we suppose thatεo∗is finite, non-null and that∫0εo∗Λo∗(ε)dεexists. Given thatΛo∗(ε)=δo2(ε)Vo∗+δo(ε)=(m-1)-∑j=1k(jn-Voj)d(j,ε)Vo∗+∑j=1kVojd(j,ε)=(m-1)Vo∗+∑j=1kVoj-(jn-Voj)Vo∗d(j,ε),we haveΛ^o=(m-1)Vo∗+1εo∗∫0εo∗∑j=1kVoj-(jn-Voj)Vo∗d(j,ε)dε.Now we focus on some specific cases of d(j,ε). Consider d(j,ε)=g(j)h(ε), where h(ε) is strictly monotonic increasing in ε (see Cook and Kress [5, p. 1309]). In this case,(11)Λ^o=(m-1)Vo∗+1εo∗∑j=1kVoj-(jn-Voj)Vo∗g(j)∫0εo∗h(ε)dε.In the following proposition we show the values ofεo∗andΛ^owhen h(ε)=ε, that is, d(j,ε)=g(j)ε.Proposition 2Consider Model(10)andΛ^ogiven by(11). If d(j,ε)=g(j)ε, thenεo∗=m-1∑j=1k(jn-Voj)g(j)andΛ^o=m-12Vo∗+n∑j=1kjg(j)∑j=1kVojg(j)-1-1.It is worth noting that the order among the candidates does not depend on the number of candidates; that is, in order to rank the candidates we can use the valueΛ^oor the following one:Vo∗+n∑j=1kjg(j)∑j=1kVojg(j)-1-1.We now show the values ofΛ^ofor three specific cases proposed by Cook and Kress [5]:1.If g(j)=1, that is, d(j,ε)=ε, thenΛ^o=m-12Vo∗+nk(k+1)2∑j=1kVoj-1-1.If g(j)=1/j, that is, d(j,ε)=ε/j, thenΛ^o=m-12Vo∗+nk∑j=1kVojj-1-1.If g(j)=1/j!, that is, d(j,ε)=ε/j!, thenΛ^o=m-12Vo∗+n∑j=1k1(j-1)!∑j=1kVojj!-1-1.Consider again the candidates of Table 1. In Table 6we show the values ofΛ^ofor the previous discrimination intensity functions.As we can see, D is the winning candidate when d(j,ε)=ε or d(j,ε)=ε/j, while C is the winner when d(j,ε)=ε/j! These results coincides with that obtained by Cook and Kress [5] when d(j,ε)=ε/j or d(j,ε)=ε/j! However, when d(j,ε)=ε, we get that D is the winner while the winning candidate with their model is B. In our case, as we can see from Fig. 1, it seems reasonable that D be the winner. Note that in Fig. 1 the functionsΛB∗(ε)andΛD∗(ε)are plotted up to the value of ε=5/178. However, the averages of the functionsΛB∗(ε)andΛD∗(ε)are calculated in the intervals [0, 5/157] and [0,5/160], respectively.Scoring rules are decision rules usually used in some areas (for instance, in sports competitions) to rank a set of candidates. The main problem that they present is the choice of the weights associated with the different ranking places. For this reason, several models have appeared in the literature trying to evaluate each candidate with the most favorable scoring vector for him/her. However, most of them are not fully convincing from the point of view of the Social Choice Theory. The score that our model assigns to each candidate (the average of the function provided for Model (10)) avoids the problems that the other models have. In addition to this, it is worth noting that, in some important cases, we give a closed expression for obtaining the scores of the candidates. So, it is not necessary to solve the proposed model.
