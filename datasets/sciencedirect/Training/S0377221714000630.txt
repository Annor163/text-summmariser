@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper discusses the way that different operational characteristics including existing capacity, scale economies, and production policy have an important influence on the capacity outcomes when firms compete in the market place. We formulate a game-theoretical model where each firm has an existing capacity and faces both fixed and variable costs in purchasing additional capacity. Specifically, the firms simultaneously (or sequentially) make their expansion decisions, and then simultaneously decide their production decisions with these outputs being capacity constrained. We also compare our results with cases where production has to match capacity. By characterizing the firms’ capacity and production choices in equilibrium, our analysis shows that the operational factors play a crucial role in determining what happens. The modeling and analysis in the paper gives insight into the way that the ability to use less production capacity than has been built will undermine the commitment value of existing capacity. If a commitment to full production is not possible, sinking operational costs can enable a firm to keep some preemptive advantage. We also show that the existence of fixed costs can introduce cases where there are either no pure strategy equilibrium or multiple equilibria. The managerial implications of our analysis are noted in the discussion. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of the strategic analysis of capacity expansion and well-known(s,S)policy in operations and supply chain theory.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The objective of this paper is to increase our understanding of how the competitive asymmetries between existing capacities and between investment/production costs affect firm capacity decisions. When a firm faces a challenge from a competitor who can introduce new capacity (either an incumbent firm with existing capacity or a potential entrant), it can be hard to decide whether to respond aggressively to rivals through adding capacity (Hayes, Pisano, Upton, & Wheelwright, 2005). The firm needs to make a trade-off: making no response or making too small a capacity addition will result in accommodating the rival, while making too large a capacity addition will result in unused capacity or depressed prices. Furthermore, capacity decisions affect most, if not all, other operating decisions including production planning and inventory levels, human resource decisions, and decisions on logistics and distribution (Hendricks, Singhal, & Wiedman, 1995). So capacity response in a competitive environment is a crucial operations challenge with a significant impact on firm profitability. An important feature of this paper is that the combined impact of existing capacities and fixed costs of investment is considered in our formal analysis. Thus we can shed light on the means by which ex ante asymmetries in operational factors can influence the firm decision on responding to its rival’s capacity expansion.
