@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A handheld approach to optoacoustic imaging is essential for the clinical translation. The first 2- and 3-dimensional handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) probes featuring real-time unmixing have recently been developed. Imaging performance of both probes was determined in vitro and in a brain melanoma metastasis mouse model in vivo. T1-weighted MR images were acquired for anatomical reference. The limit of detection of melanoma cells in vitro was significantly lower using the 2D than the 3D probe. The signal decrease was more profound in relation to depth with the 3D versus the 2D probe. Both approaches were capable of imaging the melanoma tumors qualitatively at all time points. Quantitatively, the 2D approach enabled closer anatomical resemblance of the tumor compared to the 3D probe, particularly at depths beyond 3mm. The 3D probe was shown to be superior for rapid 3D imaging and, thus, holds promise for more superficial target structures.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an emerging real-time optical biomedical imaging technique, providing non-invasive, high resolution, intrinsic or contrast-enhanced, anatomical, functional and metabolic tomographic imaging at several centimeters of tissue depth [1]. In principle, a nanosecond laser pulse in the near-infrared (NIR) range induces molecules to thermoelastically expand due to photon absorption. This short-lasting expansion generates the emission of a pressure wave that is detected by an ultrasonic transducer and converted into an image [2]. Anatomical images are generated dependent on the absorption contrast of different tissue structures in single wavelength images. Multispectral images can yield metabolic information by resolving spectral signatures of intrinsic tissue molecules or extrinsically administered contrast agents absorbing at certain spectra. Intrinsically, imaging of lipids and melanin concentration as well as the oxygenation levels by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin has been implemented by spectral unmixing based on the unique signature of the components in the NIR spectrum [3–5]. Extrinsic contrast agents such as small molecule dyes, e.g. indocyanine green, fluorescent proteins or nanoparticles can significantly enhance the optoacoustic contrast, allow deeper tissue imaging and facilitate specific molecular processes to be imaged [6–9]. We previously have shown the potential of gold nanoparticles serving as a multimodal contrast agent in high grade glioma imaging [9]. However, these studies as well as previous multispectral optoacoustic tomography studies in various other small animal models in neuroimaging [4,8], cancer [10,11] and vascular disease research [12] so far have been based on complex stagnant optoacoustic imaging devices for preclinical use only, not suitable for clinical translation [1,7]. Progress in the illumination and detector technology has led to experimental MSOT setups for potential handheld operation [13–16]. As a crucial step towards clinical application, a 2- and a 3-dimensional handheld MSOT probe have recently been developed, specifically designed with the aim of clinical translation. We studied the performance of these new MSOT handheld-probes in vitro and in vivo in a melanoma brain metastasis mouse model.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Both the 2D and 3D handheld MSOT systems provide real-time multispectral unmixing and hold great promise for clinical translation. The 2D MSOT handheld probe was found to provide sufficient resolution and sensitivity as well as high accuracy and reliability, even in highly absorbing and scattering target tissues. In comparison, the 3D MSOT handheld probe added unique 3D capabilities shortening imaging time, but was more limited in its accuracy in scenarios with highly absorbing target tissues and at greater tissue depths. Overall, the data resulting from this study has identified specific strengths but also limitations of both systems, which should aid in further improving their performance before actual clinical translation begins.V.Neuschmelting, H.L., S.H. and M.F.K. have no conflicts of interest to declare and designed the study, acquired and held control of the data, performed the analyses and wrote the text submitted for publication.
