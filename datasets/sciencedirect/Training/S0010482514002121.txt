@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a biophysical electric signal generated by the heart muscle, and is one of the major measurements of how well a heart functions. Automatic ECG analysis algorithms usually extract the geometric or frequency-domain features of the ECG signals and have already significantly facilitated automatic ECG-based cardiac disease diagnosis. We propose a novel ECG feature by fitting a given ECG signal with a 20th order polynomial function, defined as PolyECG-S. The PolyECG-S feature is almost identical to the fitted ECG curve, measured by the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and achieved a 94.4% accuracy in detecting the Myocardial Infarction (MI) on the test dataset. Currently ST segment elongation is one of the major ways to detect MI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). However, many ECG signals have weak or even undetectable ST segments. Since PolyECG-S does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can be used as a complementary MI detection algorithm with the STEMI strategy. Overall, our results suggest that the PolyECG-S feature may satisfactorily reconstruct the fitted ECG curve, and is complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Myocardial infarction (MI) is the symptom of heart cell injury due to the lack of oxygen, and is usually caused by the buildup of white blood cells in the cardiac vessels [1]. MI is one of the top two cardiovascular diseases in the United States, and is notorious for its fatality rate and frequent recurrences [2]. MI may be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, biochemical biomarkers and echocardiography imaging [3]. But its early and precise detection still remains challenging, due to the weak MI-specific association in the aforementioned data types, and the prolonged data generation steps [1,3]. Both data precision and clinician experience play essential roles in MI detection.MI may be diagnosed by the detection of significant changes in the ST segment or Q wave in the subject×³s ECG signal [1]. The ECG represents one of the major features for MI determination since the data are easy to collect and require only a short sampling duration. But the diagnostic criteria are difficult to follow due to the inexplicitness and ECG individualized polymorphism. Even experienced cardiologists may only recognize 82% of the ST-segmental elevation in MI subjects [4]. To facilitate ECG-based MI detection for inexperienced clinicians or non-cardiologists, a number of ECG analysis algorithms were proposed for automatic MI detection. But the detection accuracy of these algorithms remains to be improved for practical clinical applications. After the wavelet transformation of the ECG signals, Al-Naima and his colleagues applied a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model to the detection of MI subjects, and achieved 90% accuracy [5]. Chang et al. combined the power of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and achieved 82.5% accuracy [6].This study proposes the development of a novel ECG feature by fitting the ECG signal with a polynomial function. The polynomial function fits the ECG curve with high accuracy, and the fitted coefficients are defined to be the ECG representing features. The optimal parameters of this algorithm were determined using clinically collected ECG data from the PTB database. This new ECG feature was applied and tested on the MI detection problem, and achieved 94.4% in overall accuracy.
