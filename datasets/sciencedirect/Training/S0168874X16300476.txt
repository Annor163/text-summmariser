@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Koiter–Newton approach is a novel reduced order modeling technique for buckling analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures. The load carrying capability of the structure is achieved by tracing the entire equilibrium path in a stepwise manner. At each step a reduced order model generated from Koiter׳s asymptotic expansion provides a nonlinear prediction for the full model, corrected by a few Newton steps. The construction of the reduced order model requires derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the degrees of freedom up to the fourth order, which is two orders more than traditionally needed for a Newton based nonlinear finite element technique. In this paper we adopt the co-rotational formulation to facilitate these complex differentiations. We extend existing co-rotational beam and shell element formulations to make them applicable for the high order derivatives of the strain energy. The geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account using derivatives of the local co-rotational frame with respect to global degrees of freedom. This is done outside the standard element routines and is thus independent of the element type. We utilize three configurations and the nonlinear rotation matrix to describe finite rotations of the shell accurately, and profit from the automatic differentiation technique to optimize the programming of high order derivatives. The performance of the proposed approach using the co-rotational formulation is demonstrated using benchmark examples of isotropic and laminated composite structures.number of degrees of freedom in the full finite element modelnumber of degrees of freedom in the reduced order modelnumber of closely spaced buckling modesexternal load, internal load and residual forcedisplacements in current and nominal configurationsrelative displacement from nominal configuration to current configurationload parameters at current and nominal configurationsincrement of load parameter from nominal to current configurationslinear, quadratic and cubic forms in expansion of equilibrium equations2D, 3D and 4D tensors ofL,Q,Cload matrix, load amplitude and sub-loadsgeneralized displacement and first to third order displacement fieldslinear, quadratic and cubic forms in reduced order model2D, 3D and 4D tensors ofL¯,Q¯,C¯tangent stiffness matrixα-th unit vectorcolumn vectors of tensorsL¯,Q¯, components of tensorC¯linear displacement of the structure under the external loadfextnode numberglobal coordinate systemco-rotational frame in reference configurationco-rotational frame in nominal configurationsglobal and local degrees of freedomcomponents in global degrees of freedomqcomponents in local degrees of freedomq^initial and current length of beamangle between nominal configuration and x-axisangle between reference configuration and x-axisangle between reference and nominal configurationsposition vectors of nodes a and b in reference configurationposition vectors of nodes a and b in nominal configurationcurvature, area of cross section and strain energyglobal and local internal loads, linear stiffnesscoordinates of nodes a and b in initial configurationnode numberglobal coordinate systemaxes inTgco-rotational frames in reference and nominal configurationsaxes inT0axes inTdeformation gradient, rotation matrix, tension matrixdisplacement from reference to current configurationsrelative displacement from reference to nominal configurationsrelative displacement from nominal to current configurationstranslation part of each node inqrotation parts of each node inq,qnanduanti-symmetric matrices formed by three components inθanandϑalocal degrees of freedomtranslation and rotation parts of each node inq^anti-symmetric matrix formed by three components inθ^aposition vector of each node in reference configuration3×3 identity matrixrotation matrix of each nodelocal rotation matrix of each nodelocal strain and material matrix

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The analysis of geometrically nonlinear responses of structures is important for determining their load carrying capability, especially in the case of buckling where a limit point or a bifurcation point exists [1–8]. Utilizing the expanding computational power of modern computers nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) has become the standard technique used to obtain the nonlinear response of complex structures, however, the repeated analyses that are needed for FEA in the design loop are still computationally demanding. Thus, reduced order techniques that can be used to reduce a problem׳s size significantly are attractive.Koiter reduction methods [9–17] use the Koiter׳s famous perturbation technique [18] to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the finite element model. The main advantage of Koiter׳s theory [2,18–20] is the capability to predict quickly but accurate enough the propensity of a structure to buckle and to provide the structure׳s initial postbuckling behavior. In Koiter׳s perturbation technique, his asymptotic expansion is used only once at the bifurcation point to construct the reduced order model (ROM) which can present the initial postbuckling path of the structure. Hence, the traditional Koiter reduction method is valid asymptotically in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point. The majority of research done in this field applies an expansion of the displacement field up to the second order which is usually accurate enough to capture the initial postbuckling response of structures [16,21–24]. Damil and Potier-Ferry [25] have adopted higher order terms to increase the range of validity of the perturbation expansion further. Increasing the number of higher order terms in the displacement provides a wider range of validity. Yet, the reduced order model obtained from a single perturbation expansion still has a limited range of validity that cannot be determined a priori. In addition, the prebuckling state is assumed to be linear in most of Koiter reduction methods used in [10,15,16,24,26,27], since these methods are based on an alternative procedure proposed in Budiansky and Hutchinson [28], in which the assumption is made that the prebuckling is linear. In reality, this linear assumption for the prebuckling state will often overestimate the buckling load of an important class of engineering problems for which the prebuckling is obviously nonlinear. Cohen [26] and Fitch [27], and later Arbocz and Hol [29,30] have derived the modifications necessary to make Budiansky and Hutchinson׳s work [28] include prebuckling nonlinearity. Recently, Rahman [13,14,17] and Zagari [11,12] have made use of Arbocz and Hol׳s [29,30] derivations within a finite element context to consider the nonlinearity of the prebuckling of a structure.Apart from Koiter reduction methods which are mainly used in the static buckling analysis of structures, the idea of reduced order models has been studied intensively in the past across various disciplines following different approaches. In particular, projection methods based on Krylov subspace algorithms have a tradition due to the numerically efficient and relatively stable generation of orthogonal projection bases [31–33] often with application in structural vibration [20,34,35] and dynamics [16,36–38]. Other disciplines where reduced order models may significantly alleviate the numerical effort spent in repeated solution steps are fluid mechanics [39–42], aeroelasticity [43,44] or optimization [45,46] to mention a few. An exhaustive overview about reduced order modeling techniques and strategies, about fields of application and the analysis of convergence behavior and error-control is provided e.g. in Chinesta et al. [47] or Quaterioni and Rozza [48].The aforementioned Koiter reduction methods adopt the solution of the reduced order model as a predictor without using any correction step based on the full model [40,41,49–52]. Another family of model reduction techniques combines the prediction stage together with a correction phase [53–55]. These predictor-corrector methods [56–58] are commonly used to trace the nonlinear equilibrium path of structures. Recently, a novel approach, the Koiter–Newton method, has been proposed for the numerical solution of a class of elastic nonlinear structural analysis problems [59–61]. The range of validity of this approach is not limited to the small range near the bifurcation point, since Koiter׳s asymptotic expansion is applied from the beginning of the equilibrium path rather than only at the bifurcation point. In a series of expansion steps, a reduced order model is constructed based on Koiter׳s asymptotic expansion and used to predict the nonlinear response of the full model. A Newton method is used to correct the prediction if the accuracy of the reduced order model has been lost. In the next expansion step, the reduced order model is updated to reflect any changes in structural stiffness and load distribution. Structural nonlinearities are considered automatically using this multi-expansion strategy. The method favorably combines ideas from Koiter׳s initial post-buckling analysis with Newton arc-length methods to obtain an algorithm that is accurate over the entire equilibrium path and efficient in the presence of buckling and/or imperfection sensitivity. The Newton-based corrector phase of the presented approach uses a few factorizations of the full model. Nevertheless, the high stability of the method even for severe test cases justifies the increased numerical effort of full model on-line calculations [47] and still shows a superior numerical efficiency compared to standard path-follower methods. In [59] we presented the basic idea of the Koiter–Newton approach and demonstrated the numerical efficiency in terms of reliability and accuracy with a number of examples of moderate deformation. A specialization of the Koiter–Newton method for thin plates and shells with negligible in-plane rotations was introduced in [60] considering von Kármán kinematics which neglect higher order terms in the strain tensor components thus reducing the computational complexity of the approach.With this contribution we extend the Koiter–Newton method to large deformation analysis on the basis of a co-rotational formulation. This allows us to cover a much broader field of applications including solids and structures with a geometrically highly nonlinear response [62–64]. Structures usually undergo a large motion in the presence of buckling, hence geometrically nonlinear mechanics is usually employed in a buckling analysis [4,65–67]. Currently, three Lagrangian kinematic are used for finite element analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures [66,68,63]: (1) a total Lagrangian (TL) formulation, (2) an updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, and (3) a co-rotational formulation. The latter was the last to be developed [69,70], and the co-rotational formulation which is adopted in this paper has recently received considerable attention. In the beginning, the co-rotational formulation was not designed to be implemented in a general finite element for the nonlinear analysis of structures, since the application of this formulation is limited to an a priori kinematics assumption [66,71] which allows arbitrary large displacements and rotations but which is limited to small deformations [66]. To make the co-rotational formulation more widely applicable, the idea of multiple frames [72] has been proposed for the CR formulation. Instead of one co-rotational frame for a whole structure, each element of a structure is given on independent frame called a co-rotational element frame. This modification helps to ensure the above assumption, achieved by making the element deformational displacements and rotations small with respect to the co-rotational element frame. The application of the co-rotation formulation in Koiter׳s analysis has been studied before by some researchers. Pacoste and Eriksson [73] have investigated the possibility of using co-rotational formulation. Garcea [11] has studied implementing Koiter׳s asymptotic approach in nonlinear structural finite element models which are based on a co-rotational frame. Recently, Zagari [12,74] has presented a co-rotational formulation, suitable for a nonlinear, fourth order accurate asymptotic postbuckling analysis of shell structures, which exploits three dimensional finite rotations. However, the above applications are limited to some traditional Koiter reduction methods, which can only exploit the initial post-buckling response of structures. In the Koiter–Newton approach addressed in this contribution, Koiter׳s asymptotic expansion is applied at any known equilibrium state to construct a reduced order model. In this paper, the co-rotational formulation is adopted and used to achieve equilibrium equations in a third order form. We believe that our approach profits essentially from the co-rotational formulation for various reasons:•the element independent co-rotational frame is computationally more accurate for the case of large displacements and/or large rotations in a geometrically nonlinear analysis, as the rigid part is purged from the total motion.the co-rotational formulation addresses the accuracy and convergence problems which often occur in the implementation of a Koiter perturbation approach in a finite element context [11,14,75].the proposed Koiter–Newton approach requires derivatives of the strain energy with respect to degrees of freedom up to the fourth order. This is two orders more than traditionally needed for a Newton׳s method. Nonlinear elements based on the element independent co-rotational frame can facilitate the differentiations [76,77]. The full nonlinear kinematics are taken into account when constructing the reduced order model in this way.due to the element independent characteristics of the co-rotational frame, any type of linear elements in the current element library can be used for the Koiter–Newton approach, and geometric nonlinearities are taken into account by derivatives of the local co-rotational frame with respect to the global frame.Based on these characteristics we present the complete formulation for a two-dimensional co-rotational beam element and a co-rotational shell element for large deformation analysis including the required equilibrium equations of a third order form. The formulation considers a large rotation theory to handle the non-commutativity of the finite rotations involved [78–83]. We demonstrate the good performance achieved with the developed method with several benchmark tests. We show that our approach can exactly re-produce large deformation and buckling analysis results of standard path-follower or Newton-type methods with far less effort and with equivalent reliability and accuracy. With a comparison between sophisticated solution schemes from literature and our method we illustrate the competitiveness of our approach.The paper is organized as follows: a brief review of the Koiter–Newton approach is given in Section 2. The finite element formulation of co-rotational beam and shell elements are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Numerical examples used to demonstrate the success of the method are provided in Section 5. We summarize the paper and draw conclusions in Section 6.Let us start with a brief review of the Koiter–Newton approach outlining the essential strategy behind this novel path-tracing technique.Similar to classical path-following techniques the Koiter–Newton method is based on a step by step procedure to trace the complete equilibrium path of the deforming structure. The unique properties and algorithmic differences compared to standard methods are listed in the following with the help of the flow chart depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.As shown in Fig. 2, starting from a known nominal equilibrium state, usually the undeformed reference configuration of a structure, a reduced order model is constructed based on Koiter׳s theory which is used to make an initial nonlinear prediction of the response of the structure being analyzed. Compared to traditional Newton methods which use a linear prediction, a significantly larger step size can be achieved using the Koiter–Newton approach due to a better nonlinear prediction provided by the reduced order model, see the red, dashed curve plotted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the proposed non-linear prediction detects and traces accurately the branching into secondary stability paths at bifurcation points, cf. Fig. 1. This efficient and reliable branch detection is attributed to the implementation of the perturbation loads during the construction of the reduced order model. The perturbation loads related to the buckling modes of the structure trigger a buckling mode which is used to perturb numerically the path-following algorithm and to ensure transition at the bifurcation point to the corresponding secondary equilibrium path.During the simulation of the reduced order model, the unbalanced force residual at the new predicted location on the equilibrium path is calculated using (1), based on the full finite element model.(1)fr=λfext−fintwherefintis the internal force of the current iteration step,fextis the total external force and λ is the current load parameter. The internal force calculation is very accurate as it is calculated using the full finite element model.This residual forcefris used to judge whether the applied reduced order model is sufficiently accurate. The simulation of the reduced order model is stopped forfrbeing above a given threshold. In a subsequent corrector phase, the residual is driven toward zero in a manner similar to that used in traditional Newton arc-length methods, as indicated in Fig. 1 using a small red arrow. Based on the new found equilibrium state of the structure an updated reduced order model is constructed which is used for further load steps.There are three basic parts in each expansion step of the Koiter–Newton approach: (1) construction of the reduced order model, (2) iterative solution of the reduced order model, (3) correction of the predicted load-displacement step produced by the reduced order model. During the construction of the reduced order model, a set of augmented linear FEM equations, which will be addressed as (10) and (11) in Section 2.2, needs to be solved. Since all these systems share the same coefficient matrix, only one stiffness matrix factorization is needed. Hence, the computational cost for constructing the reduced order model is almost equivalent to the cost of solving one linear FEM system, assuming that the computational cost is dominated by a factorization and not by a forward and back substitution. Since the scale of the reduced order model is very small, i.e. usually less than ten, the computational effort for the iterative solution using the classical Newton path-following method can be neglected. During the correction of the predicted load-displacement step produced by the reduced order model, some general Newton iterations are used to increase the numerical stability of the procedure. The computational cost for each iteration is equal to the cost of solving a linear FEM system. The total numberNof the linear FEM systems which need to be solved in the Koiter–Newton approach is assessed with:(2)N=∑p=1n(1+Ncp)where n is the total number of steps taken by the method, andNcpis the number of linear FEM systems for correction in step p. The proposed Koiter–Newton approach will significantly improve the efficiency of nonlinear static finite element analysis, especially for buckling sensitive structures as demonstrated in Section 5.In this section, we briefly illustrate how the reduced order model is constructed based on Koiter׳s theory. Nonlinear equations of equilibrium are used to describe the nonlinear response of a structure. The discretized equilibrium equations are reduced to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations of the formfint(q)=λfext, wherefintandfextare the internal force vector and external force vector, respectively, λ is the load parameter of the analysis, andqis the vector of primal values, the unknown displacements in our model.In the proposed Koiter–Newton approach, a reduced order model is established to approximate equilibrium equations in the neighborhood of a known equilibrium state(q0,λ0). The vectorq0describes the configuration at this equilibrium state, which we will refer to as the known nominal configuration. Letqbe the unknown displacement vector near this nominal state, andudescribes the current configuration with respect to the nominal configuration:(3)q=u○q0where the composition ofq0anduis not always a simple addition, i.e. in the case of 3D large rotations for shells, the composition of rotations is not found by simple addition, see Section 4.The nonlinear relations are approximated by a Taylor series expansion to the third order with respect touin the nominal configuration:(4)L(u)+Q(u,u)+C(u,u,u)+O(‖u‖4)=ΔλfextwhereL,QandCdenote the linear, quadratic and cubic forms of the approximated elastic forces. These forms can also be considered as a two-dimensional tensorL, a three-dimensional tensorQand a four-dimensional tensorCof order N, where N is the total number of degrees of freedom in the finite element model. For example,Q(u,v)=Qpijuivj, where the Einstein summation convention is applied. We further useΔλ=λ−λ0and the fact thatfint(q0)=λ0fext.The proposed Koiter–Newton technique is aimed at being applicable for buckling sensitive structures. In the presence of buckling, multiple secondary equilibrium branches that intersect with the primary path at bifurcation points exist. For the method to work in such cases, the possibility of some perturbation loads that may excite the secondary branches needs to be taken into account. Thus, the equations of equilibrium (4) may be extended to consider multiple loading of the form:(5)L(u)+Q(u,u)+C(u,u,u)+O(‖u‖4)=FϕwhereFis a load matrix column-wise formed by m+1 load vectorsfα, denoted as sub-loads. The first sub-load vectorf1=fextcorresponds the external load. The remaining m load vectors are perturbation loads derived from m closely spaced linear buckling modes of the structure. The selection of perturbation loads will be addressed later. The vectorϕrepresents load amplitudes, the form of which will be presented in (14).The solutionuof (5) lies, in general, on an m+1 dimensional surface. The numerical construction of such a surface would be computationally prohibitive. To circumvent this, an approximate solution is obtained using a series expansion. The equilibrium surface is parametrized in terms of generalized displacementsξ, and the equilibrium displacement is expanded to the third order with respect toξas follows:(6)u=uαξα+uαβξαξβ+uαβγξαξβξγwhere the subscriptsα,β,γ=1,2,…,m+1, and the summation convention is applied. The first order displacementsuαdefine the tangent plane to the equilibrium surface at the approximation point. The second order displacementsuαβand third order displacementsuαβγdescribe the interactions among first and second order displacement fields, respectively.The equilibrium surface may be parametrized with an infinite number of choices forξ. To fix the parameterization, we choose the vectorξsuch that it is work conjugate to the load amplitudesϕ, as given by:(7)(Fϕ)tδu≡ϕtδξ.This leads to the following constraint equations:(8){fαtuβ=δαβfαtuβγ=0fαtuβγδ=0whereδαβis the Kronecker delta.Consistent with the displacement expansion, we assume the expansion for the load amplitudesϕto be:(9)ϕ=L¯(ξ)+Q¯(ξ,ξ)+C¯(ξ,ξ,ξ)whereL¯,Q¯andC¯are still to be determined linear, quadratic and cubic forms of the approximated load amplitudes and represented by a two-dimensional tensorL¯, a three-dimensional tensorQ¯and a four-dimensional tensorC¯of order(1+m), respectively.Using the displacement expansion (6) and the load expansion (9) into equilibrium equations (5) and equating the coefficients of the various powers of ξ with zero, and taking orthogonality conditions (8) into account results in the following two sets of governing system of equations:(10)[Kt−F−Ft0][uαL¯α]=[0−Eα](11)[Kt−F−Ft0][uαβQ¯αβ]=[−Q(uα,uβ)0]whereKt=Lis the tangent stiffness matrix, whereEαis the α-th unit vector with coefficienteα=1and all other coefficients being zero, and whereL¯αandQ¯αβrepresent column vectors of order(1+m)of the multi dimensional tensorsL¯andQ¯, respectively.The two sets of linear systems of equations, (10) and (11), have identical coefficient matrices, hence factorization is needed only once to construct the reduced order model. The dimension of the coefficient matrix is(N+1+m), where N is the number of degrees of freedom in the full finite element model and(1+m)is the number of degrees of freedom in the reduced order model. Since 1+m is generally very small compared to N, these two sets of systems can be regarded as augmented linear FEM equations [84].In addition to (10) and (11) the load and displacement expansion results in the relation:(12)C¯αβγδ=C(uα,uβ,uγ,uδ)−23[uαβtL(uδγ)+uβγtL(uδα)+uγαtL(uδβ)]whereC¯αβγδdenote the components ofC¯.The relation (12) does not need a factorization. The solution of (10)–(12) obtains the unknown displacementsuα,uαβand the unknown components ofL¯,Q¯,C¯. At this point, the expansion (9) of load amplitudes is achieved. We rewrite it in the following form, to get the reduced order model of order 1+m:(13)L¯(ξ)+Q¯(ξ,ξ)+C¯(ξ,ξ,ξ)=ϕwhere the left hand side of (13) has already been obtained after solving (10)–(12). The right hand side, which is the load amplitudesϕ, can be expressed by the load parameterΔλin the equilibrium Eq. (4) as:(14)ϕ=ΔλE1whereE1is the 1st unit vector. The dimension of the load amplitudesϕis 1+m. The first componentΔλis the increment of the parameter for external loadf1. The other components are parameters of the perturbation loadsfα,α=2,…,m+1and all are set equal to zero to simulate the response of the structure to actual loads.As shown in Fig. 2, if the buckling does not happen in the analysis, only the external load andΔλneed to be considered and there will be only one degree of freedom in the reduced order model. Otherwise, the perturbation loadsfα,α=2,…,m+1are used to excite the buckling branches, where m is the number of closely spaced buckling modes of the analyzed structure.The construction of the perturbation loads is related to the buckling modes of the structure. The buckling modes are found from a linear buckling analysis which requires the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem(Kt+μαKg)x=0at the approximation point, in whichKtis the tangent stiffness matrix,Kgis the geometric stiffness matrix, in whichμαis the coefficient of the buckling load(μαfext)andxis the corresponding buckling mode. The geometric matrixKgis calculated using the form−2Q(q,λ), whereq,λis the linear displacement of the structure under the external loadfextandQis the quadratic form of the approximated elastic forces in (4). The perturbation load is calculated by the multiplication of the geometric stiffness and the buckling mode. In this way, the buckling shapes of the structure are introduced into the algorithm as a kind of numerical perturbation, due to the use of the perturbation loads. For the interested reader this part is discussed in detail in [59].If the structure has many closely spaced buckling modes, buckling modes associated with simultaneous or nearly simultaneous buckling loads, these closely spaced modes will interact and influence the buckling characteristics of the structure. So the selection of perturbation loads should also consider this case. As a simple rule, buckling modes with buckling loads within 120% of the first buckling load are considered to be closely spaced buckling modes and used to construct the perturbation loads.Using the solution of the reduced order model the relation between the load parameterΔλand the displacement parameterξcan be found from (13). In order to get the nonlinear response about λ andq, the definitionλ=λ0+Δλand Eq. (3) are used and a displacement expansion (6) only up to the second order is invoked.From the discussion above, it can be seen that the difficulty for a finite element implementation of the Koiter–Newton approach is to obtain the expression of equilibrium equations in a third order form (5) in the known nominal configuration, which needs the derivatives of the strain energy up to the fourth order, since in the general nonlinear finite element technique we only use the derivatives up to the second order. In this paper, we focus on discussing how these high-order derivatives are achieved using the co-rotational formulation in the nominal configuration, in the following Sections 3 and 4.A classical linear Euler beam element together with an element-independent co-rotational frame is used to demonstrate the finite element implementation of the Koiter–Newton approach in this section.We introduce the descriptions of the beam element in a co-rotational frame. Based on this frame we provide local and global degrees of freedom for the beam element which allows us to extract the deformational part of the total motion by purging the rigid part before the element computations.A complete description of a co-rotational beam element using Kirchhoff theory is presented in Crisfield׳s book [68]. The deformation of a 2-D beam element from the initial undeformed configuration to the nominal deformed configuration is shown in Fig. 3. The two nodes of the beam element are denoted a and b. Three degrees of freedom are specified at each node which are two translations u, v and one rotation θ. The beam configurations are referred to the global Cartesian coordinates system (x,y) with basis vectorsx,yas depicted in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, θ is the angle between the nominal configuration and the global x-axis, θ0 is the angle between the reference configuration and the global x-axis, andΔθis the angle between the initial and current configurations.In the nominal configuration the beam element is described in an axis aligned local coordinates system with the unit vectorsex,eyas basis vectors. The basis vectorexis aligned with the coordinate direction from node a to node b. The local coordinate system co-rotates with the element movement in the 2D plane.The global degrees of freedom of the beam element in the global coordinate system (x,y) are given as:(15)q=[uavaθaubvbθb]t.In the case of large displacements and/or large rotations, the global degrees of freedom of the structure contain the rigid motion and the deformational part. Since the strain energy is only related to the deformational part, we need to pick up the local degrees of freedom which are related to the deformation, using the co-rotational frame, which results in:(16)q^=[00θ^au^b0θ^b]twhere, the two local translationsu^a,v^aof node a and the local vertical translationv^bof node b are always equal to zero during the deformation of the element, due to the definition of the local co-rotational element frame. In (16), local rotationsθ^aandθ^bcan also be called local co-rotational slopes [68].The local degrees of freedomq^of the beam element can be reduced to:(17)q^=[u^bθ^aθ^b]t.It can be seen from Fig. 3 that global and local degrees of freedom should satisfy the following geometrical relations, given by:(18){u^b=ln−lθ^a=θa−Δθ=θa−(θ−θ0)=θa−θ+θ0θ^b=θb−Δθ=θb−(θ−θ0)=θb−θ+θ0where the l and lnare the initial and current length of the beam element, respectively, θ is the angle between the current configuration and the x-axis of the global coordinate system, θ0 is the angle between the initial configuration and the x-axis, andΔθis the angle between the initial and current configurations, as shown in Fig. 3.We denote the position vectors of nodes a and b in the reference configuration withraandrb, respectively, and the position vectors in the nominal configuration withdaanddb, respectively, see Fig. 4. Then, the current length lnof the beam element can be expressed as:(19)ln2=l2−(rb−ra)t(rb−ra)+(db−da)t(db−da).The strain of the beam element is expressed as:(20)ε=u^bl=ln−ll=ln2−l2l(ln+l)=−(rb−ra)t(rb−ra)+(db−da)t(db−da)l(ln+l).The curvature of the beam element can be given as [85]:(21)κ=(−4l+6xl2)θ^a+(−2l+6xl2)θ^bThe strain energy of the beam element is first given based on the descriptions of the beam element in Section 3.1, thenL,QandCof equilibrium equations of a third order form (5) are obtained by differentiating the strain energy with respect to the global degrees of freedom.Strain energy – beam model: The strain energy of the beam element can be obtained by introducing the strain (20) and the curvature (21) into the expression of the strain energy and integrating along the length of the beam, which results in:(22)U¯=U¯(u^b,θ^a,θ^b)=12∫0l(κtEIκ+εtEAε)dx=12EAlε2+2EIl(θ^a2+θ^aθ^b+θ^b2)=12EAu^b2l+2EIl(θ^a2+θ^aθ^b+θ^b2)where E is the Young׳s modulus, and A is the area of the cross section. Since the strain energy (22) is a quadratic function of local degrees of freedom, the derivatives of the strain energy are only up to the second order. The first order derivative of the strain energy with respect to local degrees of freedom is the local internal load:(23)f^=∂U¯∂q^=[EAu^bl,2EIl(2θ^a+θ^b),2EIl(θ^a+2θ^b)]t.The second order derivative of the strain energy provides the linear stiffness matrix of the beam element:(24)KL=∂2U¯∂q^2=[EAl0004EIl2EIl02EIl4EIl].After obtaining the expression of the strain energyU¯, the internal load vectorf, the tangent stiffness matrixL, the three-dimensional matrixQand the four-dimensional matrixCcan be achieved using the first to fourth order derivatives of the strain energy with respect to global degrees of freedomq. Since the strain energy is an explicit function of local degrees of freedomq^, we should differentiate the strain energy with respect to local degrees of freedom first and then multiply the derivatives of the local degrees of freedom with respect to the global degrees of freedom. Using (23) and (24), components off,L,QandCcan be expressed as follows:(25)fp=∂U¯∂qp=KLq^m∂q^m∂qp(26)Lpi=∂2U¯∂qp∂qi=KL∂q^n∂qi∂q^m∂qp+KLq^m∂2q^m∂qp∂qi(27)2Qpij=∂3U¯∂qp∂qi∂qj=KL∂2q^n∂qi∂qj∂q^m∂qp+KL∂q^n∂qi∂2q^m∂qp∂qj+KL∂q^n∂qj∂2q^m∂qp∂qi+KLq^m∂3q^m∂qp∂qi∂qj(28)6Cpijk=∂4U¯∂qp∂qi∂qj∂qk=KL∂3q^n∂qi∂qj∂qk∂q^m∂qp+KL∂2q^n∂qi∂qj∂2q^m∂qp∂qk+KL∂2q^n∂qi∂qk∂2q^m∂qp∂qj+KL∂q^n∂qi∂3q^m∂qp∂qj∂qk+KL∂2q^n∂qj∂qk∂2q^m∂qp∂qi+KL∂q^n∂qj∂3q^m∂qp∂qi∂qk+KL∂q^n∂qk∂3q^m∂qp∂qi∂qj+KLq^m∂4q^m∂qp∂qi∂qj∂qkwhere the subscripts p, i, j, k, m and n run from 1 to 6, with 6 being the number of total degrees of freedom in a beam element. Note the summation convention is only applied on m and n.Eqs. (25)–(28) demonstrate that any linear beam element with a givenKLcan be implemented into the Koiter–Newton approach, and the geometric nonlinearity of the element is taken into account by derivatives of the local co-rotational frameq^with respect to global degrees of freedomq, which is independent of the element type.After obtaining expressions ofL,QandCfrom (25)–(28) and substituting them into (5), equilibrium equations in a third order form for the beam element are achieved, however, the derivatives of local degrees of freedomq^with respect to global degrees of freedomqin (25)–(28) are still unknown, these are discussed in the following subsection.Derivatives of local degrees of freedom: The first order derivative of local degrees of freedomq^(17) with respect to global degrees of freedomqis a(3×6)matrix:(29)∂q^∂q=[∂u^b∂q1⋯∂u^b∂qi⋯∂u^b∂q6∂θ^a∂q1⋯∂θ^a∂qi⋯∂θ^a∂q6∂θ^b∂q1⋯∂θ^b∂qi⋯∂θ^b∂q6]i=1,2,…,6.In the same way we can now derive the second to fourth order derivatives of the local degrees of freedom with respect to the global degrees of freedom which will result in a three-dimensional matrix of dimension(3×6×6), a four-dimensional matrix(3×6×6×6)and a five-dimensional matrix of(3×6×6×6×6). These matrices are formed by derivatives of the three components inq^, which are here listed only to the second order forms:(30)∂u^b∂qi=∂ln∂qi,∂2u^b∂qi∂qj=∂2ln∂qi∂qj,…(31)∂θ^a∂qi={1,ifi=30,ifi=6∂θ∂qi,ifi=others;∂2θ^a∂qi∂qj={0,ifi,j=3,6∂2θ∂qi∂qj,ifi,j=others,…(32)∂θ^b∂qi={1,ifi=30,ifi=6∂θ∂qi,ifi=others;∂2θ^b∂qi∂qj={0,ifi,j=3,6∂2θ∂qi∂qj,ifi,j=others,…where the subscripts i and j run from 1 to 6, and where we consider the fact that the geometrical relations (18) are used.From Eqs. (30)–(32) it can be seen that the unknown terms are converted into the derivatives of the current length lnand the rigid rotation θ of the beam element with respect to global degrees of freedom. A detailed description of how to calculate these two unknown groups of derivatives is given below.Referring to Fig. 3, the following geometrical relation can be easily found in a triangle formed using the current configuration of the beam and the x-axis of the coordinate system, which results in:(33)[lncosθlnsinθ]=db−da=Δr(q)where the vectorΔr(q)is related to global degrees of freedom{ua,va,ub,vb}, and can be expressed by:(34)Δr(q)=[(x0b−x0a)+(ub−ua)(y0b−y0a)+(vb−va)]where(x0a,y0a)and(x0b,y0b)are the coordinates of nodes a and b, respectively, in the reference configuration.Differentiating (33) with respect to global degrees of freedom, the following equation is obtained:(35)∂ln∂qi[cosθsinθ]+ln[−sinθcosθ]∂θ∂qi=Δr(q)∂qiwhere the right hand side is a constant vector obtained by differentiating (34), which leads to:(36)Δr(q)∂qi={[−10]ifi=1[0−1]ifi=2[10]ifi=4[01]ifi=5[00]ifi=3,6.Then, if both sides of (35) are multiplied by a vector[cosθsinθ]t, the first order derivative of the current length lnof the beam element with respect to global degrees of freedom is obtained as:(37)∂ln∂qi=Δr(q)∂qi[cosθsinθ]t.Next, if both sides of (35) are multiplied by a vector[−sinθcosθ]t, the first order derivative of the rigid rotation θ with respect to global degrees of freedom can be achieved:(38)ln∂θ∂qi=Δr(q)∂qi[−sinθcosθ]t.In the same way, the other derivatives of the current length lnand the rigid rotation θ with respect to global degrees of freedom can be achieved. We provide the higher order derivations in Appendix A.At this point all of the essential derivatives have been obtained, and introducing them into Eqs. (25)–(28) will give the equilibrium equations in a third order form for the co-rotational beam element. Following the procedures outlined in Section 2.2, the reduced order model using the co-rotational beam element can now be constructed using theL,QandCin the equilibrium equations (5).As pointed out in Section 1, 3D large rotations may appear for shells that are non-commutative and thus introduce an additional complexity in the formulation. Argyris discussed this challenge stating that “commutativity, which is one of the three essential properties of a vector, is not satisfied for two or more finite rotations about arbitrary axes in space since the sequential order of their imposition determines in each case a different result and this non-commutativity of finite rotations is, however, not only characteristic of truly large rotations but it holds even when second order effects have to be considered” [78]. We split the degrees of freedom of the shell into a translational part and a rotational part to handle this issue and to obtain a proper presentation of the derivatives needed. We use a classical linear shell element according to the theory of Kirchhoff with an element-independent co-rotational frame.Deformation gradient: A quadrilateral four-node flat shell element with six degrees of freedom per node is shown in Fig. 5. Two known configurations of this shell element during the deformation are defined, where the reference configuration is the initial undeformed configuration and the nominal configuration is the latest known configuration. In the initial step, the nominal configuration is just the reference configuration.There are several choices to define the co-rotational element frame [68,69]. Here we use the straight lines which are defined by the mid-points of two opposite sides as the coordinate axes 1 and 2, the third axis is naturally orthogonal to the plane formed by the axes 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. 5, we assume matrixT0=[d10d20d30]and matrixT=[d1d2d3]to be the co-rotational element frames in the reference and nominal configurations, respectively, which satisfies the following relationships:(39){d30=d10×d20d3=d1×d2whered1,d2,d3denote the basis vectors in the nominal configuration and whered10,d20,d30denote the basis vectors in the reference configuration.The deformation gradientFrepresents the gradient of the mapping function related to both, the reference and nominal configurations. In order to find the deformation gradient, we assume that two arbitrary vectors,a0anda, are located in the reference and nominal configurations, respectively, and that they are in the same position relative to their own co-rotational frames, given as:(40){a0=a1d10+a2d20+a3d30a=a1d1+a2d2+a3d3wherea1,a2,a3are the vector coordinates.Using (40), vectoracan be expressed bya0, as follows:(41)a=[d1d2d3][d10d20d30]−1a0.In (41), the mapping function related to these two vectors is the deformation gradient, as given by:(42)F=[d1d2d3][d10d20d30]−1.The deformation gradient can be decomposed, using the polar decomposition theorem, into a product of two second-order tensors: an orthogonal rotation tensor and a positive definite symmetric deformation tensor:(43)F=RUwhere the orthogonal matrixRrepresents the pure rotational part of the total motion, and where the symmetric tension matrixUindicates the pure deformation part of the total motion.Matrix U is obtained by multiplyingFton both sides of (43):(44)FtF=FtRU=URtRU=UUwhere the orthonormal relationRtR=Iis used.Using (43) the rotation matrixRis:(45)R=FU−1.Local translations: Global and local degrees of freedom of the shell element are expressed by two vectors of dimension(24×1),qandq^, respectively. Global degrees of freedom are measured in the global coordinate systemTg=[XYZ]in Fig. 5, and local degrees of freedom are measured in the co-rotational shell frame by purging the rigid motion.For a convenient description, degrees of freedom are divided into two parts, a translational and a rotational part. For each node a(a=1,2,3,4), the (3×1) vectorstaandθaare used to denote the translation and rotation parts of the global degrees of freedom, respectively, andt^aandθ^arepresent the translation and rotation parts of the local degrees of freedom, respectively, both discussed in the following.We assume a vectorra0in the global frameTgto be the position vector of node a in the reference configuration, see Fig. 5, andtais the global translation of this vector from the reference configuration to the nominal configuration, hence the position of the new vector in the nominal configuration isra0+ta. Then,Tt(ra0+ta)is the local position of this new vector under the nominal co-rotational frameT, which is equal to:(46)Tt(ra0+ta)=T0tra0+t^awhereT0tra0is the local position of the initial vectorra0in the reference configuration, andt^ais the local translation. The co-rotational frameT0in the reference configuration and the co-rotational frameTin the nominal configuration satisfy the following relationship:(47)T=RT0whereRis the average rotation matrix of the shell element.Substituting (47) into (46), the expression of the local translationt^ais obtained:(48)t^a=T0tRtta+T0t(Rt−I)T0T0tra0wherera0,a=1,2,3,4is the position vector of each node in the reference configuration.Local rotations: As shown in Fig. 6, an unknown current configuration which is close to the nominal configuration is introduced, excepting the reference and nominal configurations, to make a better description of the 3D finite rotation case. Based on these three configurations, the global degrees of freedomqthat present the total displacement from the reference configuration to the current configuration can be divided into two parts, which are the relative displacementqnfrom the reference configuration to the nominal configuration and the relative displacementufrom the nominal configuration to the current configuration, as given by:(49)q=u○qnwhere, as mentioned in (3), the composition ○ for rotations in the displacement is not a simple addition in the case of finite rotations, and will depend on the parametrization of the rotations.In the Cartesian coordinate system, an arbitrary rotationϑ=[φχψ]can be represented by a corresponding rotation matrixR. Then, after rotating a vectorpbyϑ, a new vectorp′can be obtained [78]:(50)p′=Rpwhere the rotation matrixRis an orthogonal matrix, and this nonlinear rotation matrix is a nonlinear function of the rotationϑ, as given by:(51)R=exp(ϑ˜)=I+ϑ˜+12!ϑ˜2+13!ϑ˜3+⋯where it can degenerate to the familiar infinitesimal rotation matrix, given by:(52)R=exp(ϑ˜)≈I+ϑ˜where matrixIis a (3×3) identity matrix, the operatorexp(…)means applying an exponent operation on the matrix in the bracket, and matrixϑ˜is an antisymmetric matrix formed by the three components of the rotation vectorϑ, which results in:(53)ϑ˜=[0−ψχψ0−φ−χφ0].If a sequence of n successive rotations{ϑ1,ϑ2,…,ϑn}is applied on the vectorp, and the corresponding rotation matrices of them are{R1,R2,…,Rn}, the final total rotation matrixRof this sequence of rotations can be written as:(54)R=RnRn−1⋯R1.Eqs. (51)–(54) show some basic properties of the rotation matrix. In this study,Ris the average global rotation matrix for the shell element, and in addition four nodes also possess their own global rotation matricesRa,a=1,2,3,4. According to (51), the local rotation matrixR^arelated to the local rotationθ^aof node a can be expressed as:(55)R^a=exp(θ^˜a)=T0tRtRaT0where the anti-symmetric matrixθ^˜ais formed by three components in the local rotation vectorθ^a, using (53).The global rotationθafrom the reference to the current configurations may be a finite rotation, while the corresponding local rotationθ^aafter removing the rigid motion can seem to be infinitesimal small. Thus, the local rotation matrixR^a(55) is rewritten in the following form according to (52):(56)R^a=exp(θ^˜a)=T0tRtRaT0≈I+θ^˜a.Since any matrix can be represented as the summation of a symmetric matrix and an anti-symmetric matrix, the anti-symmetric part of the local rotation matrixR^ashould be equal to the anti-symmetric matrixθ^˜ain (56), which leads to:(57)θ^˜a=[T0tRtRaT0]Awhere the operator[…]Ameans picking up the anti-symmetric part of the matrix in the bracket.The global rotation matrixRain (57) is related to the global rotationθaof each node, and is composed of two successive rotations which are the rotationθanbetween the reference and nominal configurations and the rotationϑabetween the nominal and current configurations. Since these rotations may be finite rotations, the composition here is not a simple addition and it results in:(58)Ra=exp(ϑ˜a)exp(θ˜an)where Eqs. (51) and (54) are used.Introducing (58) into (57), the anti-symmetric matrixθ^˜aformed by the three components of the local rotation vectorθ^aof node a can be rewritten as:(59)θ^˜a=[T0tRtexp(ϑ˜a)exp(θ˜an)T0]A.Then using (53), the local rotation vectorθ^acan be obtained by its corresponding anti-symmetric matrixθ^˜a, given by:(60)θ^a=[T0tRtexp(ϑ˜a)exp(θ˜an)T0]A−Vwhere the operator[]A−Vmeans picking up the anti-symmetric part of the matrix in the bracket and then generating a vector using the three independent components of this anti-symmetric matrix.Strain energy – shell model: In a co-rotational frame, the element strain energy only depends on local degrees of freedomq^which are related to the deformational part of the total motion, given by:(61)U¯=12ε^tCε^=12q^tKLq^where the vectorε^is the local strain of the element,Cis the material matrix, andKLis the linear stiffness matrix of a quadrilateral element. From (61), it can be seen that the element strain energyU¯is a quadratic function of local degrees of freedomq^, hence we can differentiateU¯up to a second order form, as follows:(62)f^=∂U¯∂q^=KLq^(63)KL=∂2U¯∂q^2where the first and second order derivatives of the strain energy are the local internal loadf^and linear stiffness matrixKL, respectively. Substituting (62) and (63) into Eqs. (25)–(28), we obtain the components of the internal load vectorf, tangent stiffness matrixL, three-dimensional matrixQand four-dimensional matrixCof the equilibrium equations (5) for the shell element, where p, i, j, k, m, n=1,…, 24, and the summation convention is applied on m and n. Similar to the beam element, derivatives of local degrees of freedomq^with respect to global degrees of freedomqare needed. Since local degrees of freedom have been split into local translations and local rotations, their derivatives are presented in following two parts.Derivatives of local translations: The first order derivatives of local translations with respect to global degrees of freedom are introduced below, the second to fourth order derivatives can be easily achieved following the same method.According to the expression of local translations (48), its first order derivatives result in:(64)∂t^a∂qj=T0t∂Rt∂qjta+T0tRt∂ta∂qj+T0t∂Rt∂qjT0T0tra0j=1,…,24with the unknown quantities,∂ta∂qjand∂Rt∂qj, on the right hand side. Term∂ta∂qjis obtained as:(65)∂ta∂qj={[100]t,ifqj=ta(1)[010]t,ifqj=ta(2)[001]t,ifqj=ta(3)[000]t,ifqj=otherswhereta(i),i=1,2,3are the three components of global translationta. The calculation of term∂Rt∂qjneeds some simple forward and back substitutions, which we provide in Appendix B.1.Derivatives of local rotations: Based on (60), the first order derivatives of the local rotations with respect to global degrees of freedom can be achieved as follows:(66)∂θ^a∂qj=[T0t(∂Rt∂qjexp(ϑ˜a)+Rt∂exp(ϑ˜a)∂qj)exp(θ˜an)T0]A−Vj=1,…,24.Further high order derivatives are obtained analogously. We provide the derivatives of the rotationRin Appendix B.1.The derivatives ofexp(ϑ˜a)are obtained by differentiating (51):(67)∂exp(ϑ˜a)∂qj=∂ϑ˜a∂qj+ϑ˜a∂ϑ˜a∂qj+12ϑ˜a2∂ϑ˜a∂qj+⋯≈∂ϑ˜a∂qjwhere the rotationϑabetween the nominal and current configurations approaches zero, since these derivatives are calculated in the nominal configuration. The following Eqs. (68) and (69) are used to build the derivatives:(68)ϑa=[φaχaψa]⇒ϑ˜a=[0−ψaχaψa0−φa−χaφa0],φa,χa,ψa∈q(69)∂ϑ˜a∂φa=[00000−1010];∂ϑ˜a∂χa=[001000−100];∂ϑ˜a∂ψa=[0−10100000].At this point, the derivatives of local degrees of freedom with respect to global degrees of freedom have been obtained by combining both, the translation part of the shell element, Section 4.2, and the rotation part of the shell element, Section 4.2. Introducing these derivatives into (25)–(28), the equilibrium equations (5) of the shell element in a co-rotational frame are achieved. Now, the reduced order model of the CR shell element can be constructed using theL,QandCin equilibrium equations (5).Remark 1The expressions of high order derivatives of local degrees of freedom are complicated, as discussed in Section 4.2. Thus, to facilitate the programming and to optimize the code, an automatic differentiation technology [86] is adopted during the implementation of the co-rotational shell element. In Tsukanov׳s paper [86] the data structure and algorithms are developed for the direct application of generalized Leibniz rules to the numerical computation of partial derivatives in forward mode. The proposed data structure provides constant time access to the partial derivatives, which accelerates the automatic differentiation computations. In our work, this automatic differentiation technique, based on generalized Leibniz rules, is used to differentiate a composite function in a forward mode, as given in Appendix B.2.In the following section we provide several examples that demonstrate the potential of the Koiter–Newton approach using the co-rotational formulation for buckling analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures. We compare our results to classical structural nonlinear analysis results obtained from ABAQUS [87] computations using the full number of equations of the finite element model. The discrete models in our computations correspond the models used for the ABAQUS reference solution, with the same number of nodes and elements. The step size of the proposed approach is indicated in the load-displacement diagrams of the reference solution with markers. It should be pointed out that the path-following method implemented in ABAQUS is a variant of the modified Riks method, also known as Riks/Wempner method, and this method may be not optimal in terms of number of linear systems that need to be solved. Hence, the results are also compared with those obtained in former works using different algorithms [53,56,88–90]The selected examples are classical benchmark studies of buckling analysis with large deformations, and some of the structures are made of laminated composites. They represent severe test cases due to the highly nonlinear equilibrium path and/or a number of closely spaced buckling modes which are present in the structure.Two arch structures with a different curvature are fetched from a whole circle, as shown in Fig. 7. These structures are characterized by highly geometric nonlinearities in the prebuckling state [91,92]. In this paper, we discuss the performance of the developed co-rotational beam element using the Koiter–Newton approach. We modeled the shallow arch with 80 beam elements which results in 234 degrees of freedom. The deep arch was modeled with 100 element resulting in 303 degrees of freedom.For both arch structures, the used reduced order model has two degrees of freedom, where one degree of freedom represents the primary path, and another one indicates the first buckling mode. We show the vertical displacement of the loading point versus the applied load in Fig. 8for the shallow arch. The solid line represents an ABAQUS reference solution, the triangle markers indicate the solution steps of the proposed Koiter–Newton approach and correspondingly represent the accepted equilibrium state. Each of the marked solution steps follows from a nonlinear prediction provided by the reduced order model which is indicated by the red, green and blue curve, respectively. It can be seen that the range of validity of the reduced order model is limited, the prediction is considered accurate up to the triangle marker on the equilibrium path. A few consecutive corrector steps are used to recover full equilibrium and to fully coincide with the reference solution. It is one of the essential properties of the Koiter–Newton approach that the predictor step closely follows the equilibrium path thus allowing for a significantly larger step size compared to classical methods. The range of validity is essentially determined by the projected buckling information into the reduced order model which is adapted according to the complexity of the considered structure and expected solution. As an indicator for a reliable choice of the size of the reduced order model the distribution of the buckling load spectrum is considered. All modes corresponding to closely spaced buckling modes are used to provide a sufficiently enriched reduced order model which represents the desired buckling response.The practical relevance of the large step-size used in the method becomes obvious in all stability-related problems from engineering, in particular, where a systematic analysis or a probabilistic analysis requires the consideration of a larger number of models for a reliable prediction of the structural response [93,94]. But also standard stability analyses profit significantly from the reduced numerical effort of the approach which still constitutes a limiting factor for many standard methods where the complete numerical model is used and often a large number of load steps is needed to detect reliably the singular points of a complex equilibrium path.In the remaining example of this paper we will use only markers on the reference solution to represent the step size of each Koiter–Newton step. The nonlinear response curve of the shallow arch model was obtained within 3 load steps which required 9 solutions of the global governing linear system of equations. In comparison, the ABAQUS solution adopts 41 load steps which needed 84 solution steps of the governing linear system of equations, cf. Fig. 8(a). The deep arch needs 5 load steps to solve 15 full FEM systems due to the more severe geometrical nonlinearities, compared to 89 load steps with 182 full FEM systems needed for ABAQUS, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The large deformation of the deep arch near the limit point is shown in Fig. 9and compared with the result from ABAQUS.The deep arch example has been tested in many studies using different algorithms [88–90,53]. Simo [90] needed 155 steps using the Newton–Raphson method, and Kouhia [88] used different strategies with at least 34 steps and 220 iterations. Lahmam [53] proposed a high-order predictor-corrector algorithm based on the asymptotic numerical method which needs 8 load steps.In the following example we apply our method to a frame which is composed of 7 beams, see Fig. 10(a). A similar classical benchmark, a 3D 12 member frame, has been presented and discussed in [92,95] using analytical methods or the Newton–Raphson method and its variants. Six elements per beam member are used in the current Koiter–Newton analysis which results in 249 degrees of freedom. A reduced order model with 2 degrees of freedom is constructed, where one represents the primary path, and another one indicates the first buckling mode. From the response curve about the lateral displacement of the loading point vs. the applied load in Fig. 10(b), it can be observed that the present analysis is in a good agreement with the result from ABAQUS, however, only four steps are needed in the Koiter–Newton analysis to achieve the response curve, compared to 74 steps needed by ABAQUS.A hinged semi-cylindrical roof subjected to a central pinching force, see Fig. 11(a), is a popular benchmark problem for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells due to the snap-through behavior of the structural response, and this benchmark has received considerable attention particular with respect to the Newton arc-length methods [96,97]. An isotropic material and two different laminates are considered in this example, with the properties listed in Table 1, 100 co-rotational shell elements were used to mesh the structure. The first buckling load isFpcr=4.56KNfor the isotropic case, andFpcr=3.58KNandFpcr=2.22KNfor [0/90/0] and [90/0/90] laminations, respectively. Since the first buckling loads are well separated from the others, reduced order models with 2 degrees of freedom are constructed in the Koiter–Newton approach. The nonlinear response curves, about the lateral displacement of the loading point versus the applied load, are reported in Fig. 11(b) for the isotropic material model and the two laminated composite structures, and compared with corresponding ABAQUS analysis results. Three steps with the solutions of 9 full FEM systems are used for all three material cases, compared to 44 steps solving 89 linear FEM systems needed for ABAQUS.This example is a classical benchmark and has been tested in many researches [56,53,88]. The Newton Raphson method or variants of this method need to solve 40–70 FEM systems whereas other methods such as asymptotic numerical methods [98] only need to solve less than 10 full systems of equations [53].A C-shaped beam is a commonly used structure in aerospace and marine engineering. As discussed in [12], a cantilever C-shaped beam provides a severe buckling test due to its folding plate, interaction modes and serious nonlinear prebuckling behavior [99,100]. The parameters of the C-shaped beam are shown in Fig. 12(a). We consider both, isotropic material properties and a laminate composite structure, with the properties given in Table 2. The beam is meshed with 1440 co-rotational shell elements. The reduced order model is constructed with 5 degrees of freedom, five of which are related to the first four closely spaced buckling modes, shown in Fig. 13. The first order displacement fields,u1andu2, are shown in Fig. 14. The nonlinear response curves, about the lateral displacement of loading point vs. load, for isotropic material and laminated composite are plotted in Fig. 12(b) and compared with the ABAQUS analysis. Five and six steps are used, respectively, for the two material cases, compared to the 105 steps needed for the ABAQUS analysis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The Koiter–Newton approach is a hybrid reduced order modeling technique inspired by Koiter׳s classical initial post-buckling theory and a Newton arc-length method for the buckling analysis of geometrically nonlinear structures. The proposed approach can be used to trace the entire nonlinear equilibrium path of a structure in a stepwise manner and demonstrates high effectiveness and stability in the presence of buckling.In this paper, we lay stress on the finite element formulation of beam and shell elements and implementation aspects of the Koiter–Newton approach using a co-rotational formulation. We extended the element formulations by a co-rotational formulation which facilitates the computation of the up to the fourth order derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the degrees of freedom which are needed to construct the reduced order model. Since in this formulation the geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account using derivatives of the local co-rotational frame with respect to the global degrees of freedom which are independent of the element type, we are able to apply our formulation reliably to any type of linear finite elements from the current element library. Besides a 2D beam element we provided a 3D shell element formulation which is the more challenging case due to large rotations in 3D. We first introduced three configurations to describe the deformation of the shell element, which serves the description of the large rotations. We then adopted the nonlinear rotation matrix to describe accurately the finite rotations of the shell. Finally, we used an automated differentiation technique which significantly simplifies the programming of the needed high order derivatives.Using several benchmark problems for beam and shell models we assessed the accuracy of our method and demonstrated high computational efficiency compared to established state-of-the-art finite element software packages. The high level of accuracy of the Koiter–Newton method using a co-rotational formulation is also ensured for geometrically highly nonlinear cases accompanied by buckling phenomena as demonstrated for isotropic and laminate composite shell models. Finally we showed the high efficiency of the method with regard to computational cost for tracing the complete nonlinear equilibrium response path of a structure. Compared to the computational cost of ABAQUS analysis of full dimension the proposed method reduces the effort by more than a factor 15 in almost all cases, independent of the geometric dimension. We believe that the proposed Koiter–Newton method is a successful representative of the class of reduced order models with a distinct potential to soften computational limitations during the design process of structures with a geometrically highly nonlinear response.
