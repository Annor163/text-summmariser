ObjectiveTo standardize and objectivize treatment response assessment in oncology, guidelines have been proposed that are driven by radiological measurements, which are typically communicated in free-text reports defying automated processing. We study through inter-annotator agreement and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm development the task of pairing measurements that quantify the same finding across consecutive radiology reports, such that each measurement is paired with at most one other (“partial uniqueness”).Methods and materialsGround truth is created based on 283 abdomen and 311 chest CT reports of 50 patients each. A pre-processing engine segments reports and extracts measurements. Thirteen features are developed based on volumetric similarity between measurements, semantic similarity between their respective narrative contexts and structural properties of their report positions. A Random Forest classifier (RF) integrates all features. A “mutual best match” (MBM) post-processor ensures partial uniqueness.ResultsIn an end-to-end evaluation, RF has precision 0.841, recall 0.807, F-measure 0.824 and AUC 0.971; with MBM, which performs above chance level (P<0.001), it has precision 0.899, recall 0.776, F-measure 0.833 and AUC 0.935. RF (RF+MBM) has error-free performance on 52.7% (57.4%) of report pairs.DiscussionInter-annotator agreement of three domain specialists with the ground truth (κ>0.960) indicates that the task is well defined. Domain properties and inter-section differences are discussed to explain superior performance in abdomen. Enforcing partial uniqueness has mixed but minor effects on performance.ConclusionA combined machine learning–filtering approach is proposed for pairing measurements, which can support prospective (supporting treatment response assessment) and retrospective purposes (data mining).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Health care enterprises are under continuous pressure to produce “predictable and reproducible outcomes” from clinical examinations and diagnostic tests, which “requires that diagnostic information be expressed in quantitative form” [1]. In oncology, guidelines have been proposed to standardize and objectivize treatment response assessment, such as the World Health Organization guidelines [2] and RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) [3]. These guidelines are primarily based on radiologic measurements of selected index lesions [4].Lesion measurements are generally made by radiologists [5] after selecting a set of representative and/or previously measured lesions. They are subsequently communicated by means of free-text radiology reports [6,7]. The free-text nature of radiology reports prohibits automated processing of their information content in support of downstream consumers [7–10], such as oncologists and clinical research associates (CRAs). Oncologists rely on reported measurements and qualitative assessments to synthesize treatment response status and to determine an optimal care plan. CRAs parse radiology reports of cancer patients to transcribe their lesion measurements into clinical trial databases.If lesion measurement data were available in structured [11] and digital form [12], as a supplement to the narrative radiology report, it could be leveraged to support downstream consumers. Properly grouped by lesion, structured measurement data could be used to effortlessly compute RECIST scores and could be inserted automatically into clinical trial databases. Oncology information systems that accomplish this have the potential to minimize transcription errors [13,14], improve efficiency and facilitate data-driven treatment response assessment for on- and off-trial cancer patients alike. They may further open up novel application areas such knowledge discovery through data mining [15], cohort selection using advanced queries [16], and multi-disciplinary collaboration in oncology [17].Such oncology information systems face three technological challenges. (1) Data acquisition: Data elements are obtained from structured or narrative sources [18]. In the latter case, pertinent data elements can be disclosed by natural language processing (NLP) techniques [19], for instance, for automatically synthesizing treatment histories [20] or populating registries of cancer patients [21]. (2) Data integration: multi-source and longitudinal data elements are mapped into one coherent data structure [22,23]. (3) Data presentation: integrated data elements are presented graphically to the user [24,25].Systems that address these challenges in isolation have been reported more frequently in the literature than systems that address them in combination. A recent system that exemplifies the latter category extracts neuro-oncologic findings from a history of radiology reports and normalizes it with respect to a controlled interval change vocabulary containing, e.g., “existing” and “improving” [26,27].In this work, we introduce the task of extracting and pairing measurements across consecutive reports. A unique feature of the task is that across two consecutive reports, a measurement is paired with at most one other measurement. We call this the partial uniqueness condition. This condition is motivated by the observation that in clinical practice once measured the vast majority of lesions continues to be measured in subsequent follow-up exams, unless the lesion resolves or if the radiologist fails to report its measurement. The output of automated solvers of this task can be utilized by downstream modules, e.g., for visualization or automated treatment response assessment.In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that consumes a patient’s history of narrative radiology reports and segments [28] them in the pre-processing phase. Then, addressing challenge 1, measurements are extracted, normalized and labeled with respect to their temporal orientation [29]. Finally, addressing challenge 2, measurements are paired across reports and a filter is proposed that enforces the partial uniqueness condition, which, as we argue above, holds for the vast majority of lesions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
If lesion measurement data were available in structured and digital form, as a supplement to the narrative radiology report, it could be leveraged to support downstream consumers. We proposed a natural language processing pipeline for automatically extracting and pairing measurements across consecutive radiology reports. A unique feature of this task is that between consecutive reports, each measurement is paired with at most one other measurement (“partial uniqueness”). High inter-annotator variability suggests that the task is well defined.Our main technical contribution is the development and evaluation of a Random Forest classifier that utilizes contextual, narrative and volumetric properties to decide if two measurements “match”. A novel post-processing technique is proposed that enforces partial uniqueness. This technique, when applied to the output of the base Random Forest classifier, performs significantly above chance level and has a small positive effect on F-measure and small negative effect on area under ROC.The output of the pipeline is a set of series of paired measurements that are readily visualized or used for in workflows such as treatments response assessment and advanced patient cohort selection. Our work shows that natural language processing techniques can be valuable component in an oncology information management system.
