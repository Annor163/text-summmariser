@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ultrasound imaging is one of the most important and cheapest instrument used for diagnostic purpose among the clinicians. Due to inherent limitations of acquisition methods and systems, ultrasound images are corrupted by the multiplicative speckle noise that degrades the quality and most importantly texture information present in the ultrasound image. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based on a new multiscale geometric representation as discrete ripplet transform and non-linear bilateral filter in order to reduce the speckle noise in ultrasound images. Ripplet transform with their different features of anisotropy, localization, directionality and multiscale is employed to provide effective representation of the noisy coefficients of log transformed ultrasound images. Bilateral filter is applied to the approximation ripplet coefficients to improve the denoising efficiency and preserve the edge features effectively. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conductive extensive simulations using both synthetic speckled and real ultrasound images. Experiments show that the proposed method provides better results of removing the speckle and preserving the edges and image details as compared to several existing methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The research in the medical imaging has produced many different imaging modalities for the clinical purpose. Among the different imaging modalities, ultrasound imaging is of a particular interest for medical diagnosis due to its cost effectiveness, portability, acceptability and safety [1]. However, ultrasound images are of relatively poor quality due to speckles (considered as multiplicative noise) present in them [2]. The presence of the speckle affects the human interpretation of the images as well as computer assisted methods. Furthermore, edge preserved speckle reduction and enhancement of the boundaries between different cavities and organs are of great need in ultrasound images. Thus, speckle reduction algorithms should be designed in such a manner that they suppress the speckle as much as possible without any significant loss of information.Speckle reduction methods are classified in two categories viz. image averaging and image filtering [3]. Image averaging is usually achieved by averaging a series of uncorrelated ultrasound images from different viewpoints. However, these methods suffer from the loss of spatial resolution. Image filtering methods can be further classified as single scale spatial filtering such as linear [4], nonlinear adaptive methods [5,6], multiscale spatial filtering such as diffusion based methods [3,7–9] and others multiscale methods in different transform domain such as pyramid [10], wavelet [11], curvelet [12] and ridgelet [13] based methods which adopt the multiscale geometric analysis (MGA).Currently lots of research works on image processing are concentrated in the transform domain. In that series, wavelet thresholding has been presented as a true signal estimation technique that utilizes the capabilities of wavelet transform (WT) for signal denoising [14–16]. The statistical methods such as nonlinear estimators based on Bayesian approach outperform the simple wavelet based thresholding [17]. Other despeckling techniques [15,18,19] based on Bayesian theory have been developed especially for the logarithmically transformed medical ultrasound images. In Ref. [20], wavelet based total variation filtering has been reported in which noisy image undergoes several iterations for suppressing the noise and leads to blurring effect. The WT based non-linear bilateral filter (NLBF) [21] provides better results of noise suppression and edge preservation [22]. It utilizes both the features of wavelet thresholding and bilateral filter. Wavelet transform is able to efficiently represent a function with one dimensional singularity [12,23]. However, it is less efficient in representing the sharp transition like line and curve singularities due to its limitation of direction.To overcome this limitation, ridgelet transform has been proposed that is able to capture the line singularities of the images. However, it is unable to represent curve singularities effectively [13]. Donoho et al. have used curvelet transform to represent two dimensional singularities with the smooth curve [12]. The main idea of the curvelet is to represent a curve as a superposition of the functions of various lengths and widths obeying the scaling law. To represent the edges more efficiently in medical ultrasound images, Jun et al. [23] introduced a new MGA tool called ripplet transform type I which generalizes the curvelet transform with two additional parameters to achieve the anisotropy capability that guarantees to capture the singularities along the arbitrary shaped curves effectively. The ripplet transform overcomes the limitations of other transforms and also provides the sparse representation for the objects. Thus, in the present work, the discrete ripplet transform type I (DRT) is combined with non-linear bilateral filtering (NLBF) and thresholding scheme for speckle filtering in ultrasound images.The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the methodologies used for the proposed algorithm. Section 3 illustrates the proposed algorithm which is based on non-linear filtering in ripplet domain. To compare the performance of different methods, various experimental results are presented in Section 4 with qualitative and quantitative analysis. Conclusions are drawn in the final Section 5.
