@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Iridium(III)bis(4,6-(difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2′)picolinate (Firpic) is one typical bluish-green phosphor widely used in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). In order to optimize its electroluminescent performance, 3,6-(di-tert-butyl)carbazolyl was introduced into the pyridine ring of the 2,4-difluorophenyl-pyridine ligand via a non-conjugated CH2 linkage. The generated 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-((6-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pridine-3-yl)methyl)-9H-carbazole (Cz-CH2-dfppy) was used as cyclometalating ligand to prepare iridium complex 1, (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic). In comparison with the case to attach carbazole directly on pyridine, this non-conjugated CH2 linking strategy avoids the unwanted bathochromic shift of the phosphorescence and improves the solubility of the iridium complex. (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) (1) was used as doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by both spin-coating and vacuum evaporation methods. Efficient bluish-green electrophosphorescence was obtained with maximum luminance efficiency of 22cd/A (14lm/W, 8.7%) and 26cd/A (12lm/W, 9.5%) for the solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices, respectively, which far exceed those of the parent Firpic based device. The improved performance for (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) was interpreted in terms of improved charge balance brought by the presence of the carbazole groups in the ligands.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electrophosphorescent devices that contain transition-metal complexes have attracted much attention in recent years, as they can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to realize a theoretical internal quantum efficiency of 100% [1–3]. In particular, cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes show high phosphorescent efficiencies and are one of the most important classes of phosphorescent dyes [4,5]. In order to reduce concentration quenching and triplet–triplet annihilation effects, the host–guest strategy is implemented by dispersing the guest into a suitable host at a relatively low concentration [6,7]. Over the past decade, the vacuum-deposited devices have attracted a great deal of attention for extremely high external efficiencies [8,9]. Recently, solution-processed PhOLEDs provided an economically attractive alternative to vacuum-deposited ones, which benefited from using large and bulky molecules or polymers as host or guest materials [10,11]. In the large molecular materials such as phosphorescent dendrimers, the surface groups and/or the dendrons control the processing and intermolecular interactions of the cores, which is responsible for the emission of light [12,13]. Nonetheless, the incorporation of the phosphorescent emitter with decorating groups through conjugated approaches usually causes a red shift in emission spectrum [14]. In order to keep the emission energy and wavelength, non-conjugated linkage between the emissive core and the decorating group is believed to be an ideal strategy that may have the advantage of being solution processable and to tune the optoelectronic properties of the target materials.In this work, we report the synthesis and properties of the novel derivative of Firpic, (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic) complex (1). tert-Butyl-carbazolyl was introduced via non-conjugated CH2 linkage [15] into the pyridyl ring in the difluorophenylpyridine (dfppy) ligand to tune the optical and electronic behavior of the resultant iridium complex 1. The electrochemical, photophysical properties of the complex 1 was investigated. Particularly, complex 1 was used as doped emitter to fabricate OLEDs by both spin-coating and vacuum evaporation methods, and the Firpic-based devices with identical architectures also fabricated for comparison. The maximum luminance efficiency of 22cd/A (14lm/W, 8.7%) and 26cd/A (12lm/W, 9.5%) were realized for solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices of (Cz-CH2-dfppy)2Ir(pic), respectively, which far exceed those of the parent Firpic based device.The synthetic route of the complex 1 is shown in Scheme 1. First, the reaction of 2,4-difluorophenyl boronic acid with 2-bromo-4-methylpyridine in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst [16] produced the intermediate 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-methylpyridine, which was brominated with N-bromosucciniimde (NBS) in the presence of azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in CCl4 to give the 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(bromomethyl)pyridine. Then 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(bromomethyl)pyridine was then added dropwise into the solution of sodium hydride and 3,6-ditertbutylcarbazole in dimethylformamide [17] to form the ligand 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(ditertbutylcarbazolyl-methyl)pyridine. Next the target iridium complex was prepared following the standard two step procedure, i.e. the ligand first reacted with chloride trihydrate in 2-ethoxyethanol at high temperature and then the dichloro dimer intermediate was treated with picolinic acid in the presence of potassium carbonate in the 2-ethoxyethanol to give the final iridium complex 1[18].2-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-4-(ditertbutylcarbazolyl-methyl)pyridine Ligand: 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.66 (s, 1H), 8.13 (s, 2H), 7.98–7.92 (m, 1H), 7.60–7.57 (d, 1H), 7.50–7.48 (d, 2H), 7.43–7.40 (d, 1H), 7.29–7.25 (d, 2H), 6.99–6.94 (m, 1H), 6.89–6.83 (m, 1H), 5.50 (s, 2H), 1.45 (s, 18H).

Found: C, 65.73; H, 5.25; N, 5.52.The UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the complex 1 was measured in CH2Cl2 solution. The absorption and photoluminescence spectrum of Firpic was also measured for comparison. The electrochemical behaviors of the complex 1 and Firpic were measured in deoxygenated CH2Cl2 solutions containing 0.1M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as supporting electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry.The organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were made and measured in the following way. The pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 30Ωsquare−1 were treated by UV-ozone for 20min. Then 40nm thick PEDOT:PSS film was first deposited on the ITO glass substrates, and baked at 120°C for 30min in air. For the solution-processed devices (device I), the emitting layer was obtained by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution of iridium complex dopant and a certain host at a doping concentration of 10wt%. Then, the substrate was transferred to the vacuum chamber for organic and metal deposition. For the evaporated devices (device II), all the organic layers were deposited by vacuum evaporation in the vacuum chamber with a base pressure less than 10−6torr. The type I devices have the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/H1 (60wt%): OXD-7 (30wt%): 1 or Firpic (10wt%) (30nm)/TPBI (60nm)/LiF (1nm)/Al (200nm). The type II devices have the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40nm)/NPB (20nm)/mCP: 1 or Firpic (10wt%) (30nm)/TPBI (60nm)/LiF (1nm)/Al (200nm). Particularly, the host H1 employed in solution-processed devices was previously reported by Wang et al. [19]. These multi-layer devices and chemical structures of materials are shown in Fig. 1. The emitting area of each pixel was determined by the overlap of both anode and cathode as 9mm2. The EL spectra, CIE coordinates and current density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics of the devices were measured with PR705 photometer and a source–measure-unit Keithley 236 under ambient conditions. The forward viewing external quantum efficiency (ηext) was calculated using the luminance efficiency, EL spectra and human photopic sensitivity.
