An automatic system to identify heart disease risk factors in clinical texts over time

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We proposed a hybrid system to automatically identify heart disease risk factors.We divided different types of risk factors into three categories according to their descriptions.Our system achieves an F-score of 92.86% on 2014 i2b2 corpus, which is top-ranked.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Despite recent progress in prediction and prevention, heart disease remains a leading cause of death. One preliminary step in heart disease prediction and prevention is risk factor identification. Many studies have been proposed to identify risk factors associated with heart disease; however, none have attempted to identify all risk factors. In 2014, the National Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and Beside (i2b2) issued a clinical natural language processing (NLP) challenge that involved a track (track 2) for identifying heart disease risk factors in clinical texts over time. This track aimed to identify medically relevant information related to heart disease risk and track the progression over sets of longitudinal patient medical records. Identification of tags and attributes associated with disease presence and progression, risk factors, and medications in patient medical history were required. Our participation led to development of a hybrid pipeline system based on both machine learning-based and rule-based approaches. Evaluation using the challenge corpus revealed that our system achieved an F1-score of 92.68%, making it the top-ranked system (without additional annotations) of the 2014 i2b2 clinical NLP challenge.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Heart disease attracts much attention, given its history as the number one cause of death in both women and men throughout the world [1]. Several factors have been identified as risks related to heart disease, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and smoking status. In order to predict and prevent heart disease, it is necessary to first identify risk factors embedded in unstructured clinical documents. Over the last decade, many studies have been undertaken to identify these risk factors, resulting in the creation of publicly available tools, such as clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System [2], an open-source tool capable of identifying smoking status. However, no study has investigated the identification of all risk factors associated with heart disease, possibly due to the diversity of their clinical descriptions.Heart disease is often related to other diseases, such as diabetes, that share several observable characteristics, including obesity and smoking status, as well as some medications, such as metoprolol. All of these were regarded as heart disease risk factors for this study.The main challenge in identifying all heart disease risk factors is that they are presented in a variety of forms in clinical texts. To comprehensively investigate the identification of all heart disease risk factors, the National Center of Informatics for Integrating Biology and Beside (i2b2) issued a risk factor identification track (track 2) in the clinical natural language processing (NLP) challenge in 2014 [3]. The goal was to identify information medically related to heart disease risk and track its progression over sets of longitudinal patient medical records. We participated in this track and developed a hybrid pipeline system based on both machine learning and rule-based approaches.In our system, all heart disease risk factors were divided into three categories according to their descriptions, with each category identified individually. Evaluation using the challenge corpus revealed that our system achieved an F1-score of 92.86%, making it the top-ranked system (without additional annotations) for the 2014 i2b2 clinical NLP challenge.
