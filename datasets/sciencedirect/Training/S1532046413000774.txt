We describe a novel algorithm for converting weight-based dosing guidelines into administerable doses for children.This algorithm features combines medication knowledge, dosing knowledge, and dose administering knowledge.We report the performance of this approach, and discuss the limitations encountered thus far.

ObjectivePediatric dose rounding is a unique and complex process whose complexity is rarely supported by e-prescribing systems, though amenable to automation and deployment from a central service provider. The goal of this project was to validate an automated dose-rounding algorithm for pediatric dose rounding.MethodsWe developed a dose-rounding algorithm, STEPSTools, based on expert consensus about the rounding process and knowledge about the therapeutic/toxic window for each medication. We then used a 60% subsample of electronically-generated prescriptions from one academic medical center to further refine the web services. Once all issues were resolved, we used the remaining 40% of the prescriptions as a test sample and assessed the degree of concordance between automatically calculated optimal doses and the doses in the test sample. Cases with discrepant doses were compiled in a survey and assessed by pediatricians from two academic centers. The response rate for the survey was 25%.ResultsSeventy-nine test cases were tested for concordance. For 20 cases, STEPSTools was unable to provide a recommended dose. The dose recommendation provided by STEPSTools was identical to that of the test prescription for 31 cases. For 14 out of the 24 discrepant cases included in the survey, respondents significantly preferred STEPSTools recommendations (p<0.05, binomial test). Overall, when combined with the data from all test cases, STEPSTools either matched or exceeded the performance of the test cases in 45/59 (76%) of the cases. The majority of other cases were challenged by the need to provide an extremely small dose. We estimated that with the addition of two dose-selection rules, STEPSTools would achieve an overall performance of 82% or higher.ConclusionsResults of this pilot study suggest that automated dose rounding is a feasible mechanism for providing guidance to e-prescribing systems. These results also demonstrate the need for validating decision-support systems to support targeted and iterative improvement in performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
E-prescribing has emerged as a core component of an assumed safe national healthcare system [1–6]. Federal initiatives such as the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act specifically require the use of e-prescribing by all medical specialties [7].However, despite this widespread enthusiasm for e-prescribing, not all e-prescribing systems support the needs of all specialties. A recent AHRQ report [8] noted issues of usability with these systems. There is less data to support the use of e-prescribing in the ambulatory pediatric community [9], despite the challenges associated with pediatric patient medication management [10]. A study by Kaushal noted the potential for e-prescribing to prevent up to 21% of adverse drug events in outpatient settings, including those related to drug frequency and weight/dose checks [11].Pediatric prescribing is a complex process that requires the prescriber to calculate a medication dose that is appropriate for the treatment goals and for the child’s weight or body surface area [6]. While some medications are relatively tolerant of inaccurate dosing, others with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g., Digoxin) have a great potential for adverse consequences if dosed improperly [12–14]. This process is sufficiently complicated that most pediatricians rely on prescribing guides in print or electronic form to practice safely [15,16]. Recent advances in medications available to treat severe conditions also impact children with these conditions [15,17].One particular area of concern is the lack of sophistication used when e-prescribing systems automatically calculate doses. Should a 4.7kg child receiving 5mcg/kg/dose of digoxin, totaling 23.5mcg, receive 0.5ml (25mcg, or 10.6mcg/kg/day) or 0.4ml (20mcg, or 8.51mcg/kg/day)? Or should the child receive the exact dose of 0.47ml, which would likely be complicated to administer at home or require asking for a custom formulation, which can be expensive?In the spirit of “a rising tide lifts all boats,” one method to systematically improve dose-rounding decision support in pediatric e-prescribing is through the use of cloud-based tools that may be developed and maintained by knowledge experts and adopted by all e-prescribing systems with a minimum of effort. This approach goes by many names, including “Software as a Service,” or web services. The goal of this project was to design, develop and evaluate an algorithm for use in this manner.
