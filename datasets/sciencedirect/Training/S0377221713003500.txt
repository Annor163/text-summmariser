@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Managing knowledge based resource capabilities has become very important in recent years and during a finite horizon it seems to be reasonable to develop the capabilities intensively at the beginning as one can utilize those over a longer period of time. With the help of multi-period models we check the validity of this idea and characterize the dynamics of development activities. The paper identifies the factors that shape these dynamics and from the behavior of these factors we conclude when the dynamics can be increasing or decreasing. We point out that in stable environment there is tendency for decreasing dynamics but future expectations can significantly modify this outcome. Relationships between the successful or less successful implementation of a business strategy and the dynamics of improvement activities are highlighted as well. For specific model structures explicit solutions are derived.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The implementation of continuous process improvement seems to be a crucial point in modern business life. Not long ago, when Mr. Watanabe, the chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, was asked about the essence of Toyota Way, he mentioned continuous improvement as one of the two most important pillars of managing a company (Watanabe, 2007). The successful implementation of the principles of the Toyota Production System has revolutionized many industries, and the principles of TPS are used by many other manufacturers like Porsche or VW (Fear & Knoop, 2007).The inclusion of process improvement into models is popular, especially since the appearance of seminal papers like (Fine (1986)), or Dorroh, Gulledge, and Womer (1994), who presented a model to determine the amount of resources to be devoted to knowledge acquisition. Chand, Moskowitz, Novak, Rekhi, and Sorger (1996) developed a dynamic model and analyzed the effect of continuous process improvement on capacity allocation to maximize profit over time. They introduce the concept of productivity knowledge that can be increased by improvement activities. Li and Rajagopalan’s (1998) study models quality assurance efforts, level of productivity and quality knowledge improvement efforts as decision variables. All these studies advocate early significant investments with declining rate in knowledge discovery programs. Besides this extensive theoretical development of dynamic quality-based learning models Ittner, Nagar, and Rajan (2001) carried out a direct empirical test of these models. Carillo and Gaimon (2000) identify conditions whereby investment into process change occurs at an increasing rate over time, but in their model process change may cause immediate losses. In one of their later studies, Carillo and Gaimon (2004) define two models to gain insights on how plant performance is impacted by training and process change. Vörös (2006) builds a model whereby demand directly depends on the performance quality of the product. The inclusion of quality improvement process into the dynamic approaches has been recently analyzed by Chenavaz (2012) and it was found that under multiplicative separable demand function process innovation is the main determinant of a firm’s pricing policy over time and product innovation has no impact. In the paper of Li and Lee (2010) the driving dynamics of quality is considered in case of peer-production. Among others, they found that a monopolistic platform provider has no incentive to offer multiple quality classes of services. The operations-marketing interface is further analyzed by De Giovanni (2011) where both advertising and quality improvement contribute to the build up of goodwill, and the co-operation of manufacturer and retailer leads to a better market position.Considering simultaneous quality and process improvement activities Vörös (2006) pointed out also that the dynamics of quality and process improvement activities can be increasing as well, however he missed to fully characterize the dynamics of improvement activities. Thus, according to the wide variety of research reports, already alone the dynamic behavior of improvement activities is a challenging question.This study attempts to identify all the factors that shape the dynamic nature of improvement activities and provides a complete analysis of when are the dynamics of improvement activities increasing or decreasing. The paper determines a key expression and finds that the dynamic behavior of the components of this key expression explains mainly the dynamics of improvement activities.Interestingly, in all the theoretical models mentioned above, time is a continuous variable, and the tools of optimal control theory are used. Models many times tend to assume continuous differentiability and time independent model parameters, and we rarely see multi period models in this field. Recently, one of the latest contributions is made by Berstein and Kök (2009), who develop a multi-period model and consider a decentralized assembly system with process improvement activities. Among others, they point out that under cost contingent contracts, there always exists an equilibrium (in Stackelberg competition) where in each period either all suppliers invest in process improvement or no supplier does. They provide a procedure to calculate the optimal investments into productivity knowledge.This paper develops multi period versions of optimal control models to analyze the dynamic nature of price and improvement activities. In this model the time horizon is divided into periods and in each period we have to make decision on the intensity of improvement activities. In turn, improvement activities, if they are at positive level, increase the productivity knowledge. The level of productivity knowledge at each period determines unit production costs. In each period we make decision on price level as well, which determines the volume of demand at the period. At the end of the planning horizon the accumulated knowledge can be sold at a given price. A strong characteristic of the model is that the input parameters of demand function may vary from period to period.Although the Berstein and Kök (2009) single firm model is a multi period one, their model is also analyzed for the special case when the parameters of the linear demand function are time independent in order to ease the understanding the nature of more general structures. This analysis helps us to reveal relationships between model structures and the dynamics of improvement activities. Besides the insights provided by the multi period technique, we give the explicit description of the optimal solution for this special parameter setting.Altogether, our study intends to extend our knowledge in four points: for rather general models, among the most interesting findings there is the identification of the factors that shape the dynamics of improvement activities. Moreover, finding relationship between model structure and the dynamics of improvement activities, the paper classifies models from which the dynamics of improvement activities simply must follow. This result allows us to position the well known models mentioned above in a table which classifies the model structures (see Table 2 later). The study reveals relationship between the successful or less successful implementation of a business strategy and the dynamics of improvement activities (see Table 1later), and gives the explicit solution of models with linear demand and investment cost functions.The next section develops a rather general multi period model, and Section 3 analyzes this model with linear demand and investment cost functions. Based on this, in Section 4 the analysis turns back to the basic model and Section 5 explains why the dynamics must sometimes follows from model structures. Section 6 presents the conclusions.In this section we formulate a general model and the final aim is to analyze it. To ease the discussion, first we specify the functions of the general model in the next step, and later we turn back to the base case. We suppose that our firm’s product has unique characteristics others cannot copy, substitute, or imitate easily, thus our firm can behave like a monopoly with certain extent. This way demand can be described by the function Dt(pt) at period t, where ptis the selling price of the product at period t, and we divide the planning horizon into T periods (t=1,…,T). The unit production variable cost is c(qt) at period t, where qtmeasures the accumulated productivity knowledge at period t. This productivity knowledge can be increased by improvement activities at each period, and the extent of the improvement activities at period t is measured by the variable yt. The cost of this productivity improvement effort is f(yt) at period t. We suppose that at the end of the planning horizon the accumulated productivity knowledge can be sold at the unit price of P. As the lowest possible value of this parameter can be zero, the inclusion of the selling price of productivity knowledge extends the scope of the study, more importantly, positions our model closer to real life. Managers frequently introduce new product generations on the basis of knowledge accumulated during the life of previous generations, purchase knowledge, or sell it when they quit the business. Thus the accumulated productivity knowledge may have value. Let us note that Li and Rajagopalan (1998) already have used the concept.The basic model we consider can be written in the following form then:(1a)maxpt,yt∑t=1T[(pt-c(qt))Dt(pt)-f(yt)]δt+[PqT]δTsubjected to, for all t, that,(1b)qt=qt-1+atyt(1c)pt,yt⩾0.where T is the number of periods, t is the index of a period, t∈[1,T], ptis the selling price at period t, decision variable, qtis the accumulated productivity knowledge at period t, with the initial value of q0, dependent variable, ytis the level of process improvement efforts at period t, a decision variable, f(yt) is the cost of productivity improvement effort at period t, c(qt) is the unit variable cost function at period t,Dt(p) is the volume of demand at period t, when the price is p P is the selling price of one unit productivity knowledge at the end of the planning horizon, and δ is the 1/(1+r), where r is the discount rate, and atare positive parameters.In Model (1) the discounted gross profit, plus the terminal value of the accumulated productivity knowledge are maximized under the rule of how productivity knowledge is accumulating. We suppose that productivity knowledge accumulates as a linear function of improvement efforts.To ease the exploration of the nature of the model varified in (1), first we define simplified versions. Berstein and Kök (2009) point out interesting characteristics of the model in (1) when the unit variable cost function c(qt)=c0(qt)−β(where c0 and β are positive parameters), the productivity improvement (investment) cost function f(yt)=kyt, k>0, where k is constant parameter, moreover P=0, and at=1 for all t. We further simplify their model with assuming time independent parameters at the demand function. We are going to point out some properties of the dynamics of variable y (the level of improvement efforts) with linear demand functions. Let us assume the parameters of the demand function do not depend on time, i.e. Dt(pt)=α−γpt, where α and γ are positive parameters.Technically we can assume that γ=1 in the demand function. Before turning to the multi period case, it will be useful to study the properties of the following one period model:(2a)maxp,y{(p-c0q-β)(α-p)-ky}(2b)s.t.q=q0+y(2c)p,y⩾0.It is enough to invoke that α>c0(q)−β, and we will have positive production level. Otherwise the company/product line would be shut down. Based on the inputs of model (2), let us define Φ as function of q in the following way:(3)Φ(q)=c0β(αq-β-1-c0q-2β-1)/2.Fig. 1. depicts a typical Φ(q) function.It can be calculated that this function has the unique maximum at:(4)qmax=c0α2-1β+11/β.Substituting this value in (3), let this maximum value be denoted byΦmax=Φ(qmax).Based on Fig. 1, if k<Φmax, the equation Φ(q)=k has two solutions, and let qoptdenote the larger value for which Φ(qopt)=k.Proposition 1Process improvement is not always beneficial. Too high heritage of productivity knowledge and poor results of improvement efforts, or expensive development hinder investments into productivity knowledge. On the other hand, large marginal benefit of improvement efforts spurs investments.In details, in Model(2)if k⩾Φmax, then improvement activities are at zero level (productivity knowledge will not increase). (The optimal profit volume is increasing and convex in q0when (c0/α)1/β<q0⩽qmax, and concave for q0>qmax.) If k<Φmaxand qopt⩽q0, then improvement activities are at zero level also (and the optimal profit volume is increasing and concave in q0). If k<Φmaxand qopt>q0, then improvement activities are at positive level (y=qopt−q0). (The optimal profit volume is increasing and linear function of q0on the 0⩽q0⩽qoptinterval.)Denoting the objective function of (2) by L, the necessary and sufficient assumptions for having maximum are:(5a)δL/δp=(α-p)-(p-c0q-β)⩽0,(5b)δL/δy=βc0q-β-1(α-p)-k⩽0,(5c)(δL/δp)p=0,(δL/δy)y=0.Assuming α>c0(q)−β, in (5a)p is positive and thus(6)(p-c0q-β)=(α-p)from which(7)p=(α+c0q-β)/2follows. Substituting the optimal price into (5b), we have(8)c0β(αq-β-1-c0q-2β-1)/2⩽k.The left-hand-side of (8) is the function Φ we defined in (3). If k⩾Φmax, then y=0, and as we assumed that α>c0 (q0)−β, there will be positive level production, i.e. (6) has feasible solution. (Otherwise sell the knowledge at the highest possible price.)On the other hand, if k<Φmax, the equation Φ=k has solution for q, and we denoted it by qopt. If this qopt<q0, then (5b) is strict inequality, and by (5c), y=0. Otherwise, y=qopt−q0 and (5b) is equality.Now let us turn to (6), and multiply both sides with the optimal production quantity (α−p), and denoting the optimal profit volume without investment cost by Π, we can write the following:(9)Π=(p-c0q-β)(α-p)=(α-p)2.Based on (7), substituting the optimal price into (9), we haveΠ=(α-c0q-β)2/4,from whichδΠ/δq=Φ.Consequently, δ2Π/δq2=δΦ/δq, what we have already analyzed. Thus we know that δ2Π/δq2 changes sign exactly at qmax, and until this point Π is convex, and after concave. When y=0, then L=Π. When y>0, L=Π−ky, and each unit growth of the productivity knowledge heritage (q0) substitutes one unit of y, and thus save the cost of k. Consequently, the increase of the objective function is linear in q0 until the point qopt, and we completed the discussion of Proposition 1. Proposition 1 extends our knowledge as for full parameter set we characterized the nature of the solution.Example 1Let α=8, then D=8−p, co=4, k=3/4, qo=3, and β=1/2.Then the marginal benefit of improving productivity knowledge, as function of q, is described asΦ(q)=42q-1/q2. Φ has its maximum at qmax=0.44, where Φmax=6.75. Thus the equation Φ(q)=k has solution for q, moreover this solution is qopt=4. As y=qopt−qo, it follows that it is optimal to spend y=1 unit of time with improving productivity knowledge, during the period.Now, we are ready to extend the analysis to the multi period problem. Let us consider the following model, where T>1, and we assume that r>0, i.e. δ<1:(10a)maxpt,yt∑t=1T[(pt-c0(qt)-β)(α-pt)-kyt]δt+[PqT]δTsubject to(10b)qt=qt-1+yt,and(10c)pt,yt⩾0for allt.Based on (10b), we can write thatqt=q0+∑i=1tyi,and substituting this at the objective function, we can write the necessary and sufficient conditions as:(11a)δL/δpt=(α-pt)-(pt-c0(qt)-β)⩽0,t=1,…,T(11b)δL/δyt=βc0∑j=tTδj(qj)-β-1(α-pj)-kδt+PδT⩽0,t=1,…,T(11c)(δL/δpt)pt=0,(δL/δyt)yt=0,t=1,…,T.The assumption α>c0(q0)−βis sufficient to have positive production level at each period, thus from (11a) and (11c) we gain that(12a)pt=(α+c0(qt)-β)/2,t=1,…,T,and from (11b)(12b)βc0∑j=tTδj-t(qj)-β-1(α-pj)⩽k-PδT-t,t=1,…,T.(12b) expresses that the investment cost of process improvement may be paid back at later periods as well, and the salvage value diminishes this task.Letk1=k(1-δ),k2=k-PδT-1∑j=1Tδj-1,andk3=k-P. Supposing that the equations below have solution for q, let qopt1, qopt2, and qopt3 be the larger values satisfying Φ(q)=k1, Φ(q)=k2, and Φ(q)=k3, respectively.In Model(10), if the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge falls into the interval of k>P>kδ, moreover k1<Φmaxand q0<qopt1, then the dynamics y1>0, y2=⋯=yT−1=0, yT>0 is optimal for process improvement activities. However, if qopt3>q0⩾qopt1, then the y1=y2=⋯=yT−1=0, yT>0 dynamics is optimal, and if q0even larger, q0⩾qopt3, then yT=0, too. Depending on the value of q0, these last two dynamics are also optimal, when k1⩾Φmaxbut k−P<Φmax.For P⩽kδ, if k2<Φmaxand q0<qopt2, then y1>0, y2=⋯=yT=0 is an optimal dynamics. Otherwise y1=y2=……=yT=0.Proposition 2. fully characterizes the dynamics of the process improvement activities and gives the explicit solution of the problem. The proof can be found in Appendix A.The managerial insight provided by Proposition 2 is that in case of stable environment development takes place at most the first period only. Then the resources inherited and developed in the first period are utilized throughout the time horizon and no further development is suggested. The stable environment is expressed by the fact that the parameters of the demand function do not change over time expressing that the reaction of customers for price changes is the same in each period. Only a very favorable, large selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of the time horizon can modify these dynamics. There will be a positive level investment at the final period, because the accumulated knowledge can be sold at a very lucrative price. So, in case of linear demand and investment cost functions with time independent parameters, only large, favorable selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of time horizon involves the increase of improvement activities at the final period. Otherwise, improvement activities are kept at zero level over time, except the first period, only if the heritage of the productivity knowledge is low, and the marginal benefit of the improvement activities is sufficiently high. Price and production levels are constant over time, except when improvement activities are at positive level at the final period.Example 2Let α=8, then D=8−p, co=4, k=3/4, qo=3, β=1/2, r=0.2, and the time horizon T=5. Moreover, let us suppose that the accumulated productivity knowledge has no value at the end of the time horizon, thus P=0.Then again, the marginal benefit of improving productivity knowledge, as function of q, is described asΦ(q)=42q-1/q2. As the value of P=0, activities are at zero levele at the final period. As k2=0.21,which is lower than Φmax(and lower than k), improvement activities will be at positive level at the first period, and are zero during the rest of periods. The solution of the equation Φ(q)=k2 is qopt2=10, and consequently y1=10−3=7, while y2=y3=y4=y5=0. The optimal price is constant over periods and from (12a)pt=8+4/10/2=4.6for each period, and demand (or production) level is 3.4 units in each period. Unit variable production cost does not change over the time, which is 1.26. It is interesting to note that while the level of improvement activities is decreasing over time, the accumulated productivity knowledge is significantly larger at the five-period model than at the one-period model. The recommended activity level is seven time units during the first period and zero during the rest of periods.Utilizing the insights we gained with the linear functions, we decrease the specifications, and turn back to model (1) with the following assumptions. Let us assume that at=a for all t, and connected with the functions of the model, we assume that c(q) is decreasing and convex function of q. Concerning the demand function, we assume that Dt(c(q0))>0, i.e. there are customers who are willing to pay more for the product than its production cost. This means that the system is able to produce a profit. We further assume that Dt(pt) is decreasing in price and there exists a finite K, for which Dt(pt)<K, in each period. The cost of process improvement is measured by f(yt), which is increasing and strictly convex. These assumptions are used widely in the related literature and one can find an extensive explanation for the diseconomies of scale connected with increasing knowledge in Carillo and Gaimon (2004), for example.Our objective function is subjected to the only assumption:qt=qt-1+ayt,or otherwise,qt=q0+a∑i=1tyi.Similar relationship for modeling the accumulating knowledge has been used by Chand et al. (1996), Li and Rajagopalan (1998) or Berstein and Kök (2009), while Carillo and Gaimon (2000) assumed that process change can cause immediate losses as well. The meaning of this assumption is that parameter a may have negative values temporarily. (In our assumptions parameter a is positive.)In this case the objective function reduces to the form of(13)L=∑t=1T[(pt-ct(y1,y2,…,yt))Dt(pt)-f(yt)]δt+Pq0+a∑i=1TyiδT.Supposing that decision variables are positive, the necessary conditions would be (subscript will denote the partial derivative of the function with respect to the variable throughout the paper):(14a)∂L/∂pt=Dt+pt-ctDptt=0,t=1,2,…,T(14b)∂L/∂yt=∑j=tT-Djcytjδj-fytδt+aPδT=0,t=1,2,…,TAs Dt(c(q0))>0, there should be price level for which unit profit margin is positive and if (15) has solution, then(15)pt-ct=-Dt/Dptt,t=1,2,…,TasDpttis negative. For pt=ct(q0) the left-hand-side of (15) is zero, while the right one is positive. The left hand-side is increasing in price with the rate of one. Consequently, the assumptionδ-Dt/Dptt/δpt<1for the demand function assures finite solution for (15). Taking the partial derivative of the right-hand-side of (15) with respect to the price, and requiring that it should be less than one, we have(16)DptpttDt<2Dptt2,t=1,2,…,T,which is satisfied by the most popular demand functions. Thus assuming that Dt(c(q0))>0, and that the demand function in each period satisfies (16), there is positive, finite value of p which is the solution of (15), assuring maximum profit.Supposing positive y satisfying (14b), let us divide both sides of the equations in (14b) by δt. Then we have(17)fyt=∑j=tT-Djcytjδj-t+aPδT-t,t=1,2,…,TThe right-hand side of this equation is positive as the unit variable cost decreases as productivity knowledge increases, i.e.cytj<0, and demand is at positive level. Let us note also thatcyjt=∂ct/∂yj=(∂c/∂qt)(∂qt/∂yj)=a∂c/∂qt=acqtfor all j⩽t. As a function of yt, the firs part of the right-hand-side of (17) approaches zero as ytmoves toward infinity because D has finite upper limit, and the marginal benefit of knowledge increase is decreasing (let us note that in a period and not over time). Thus if the derivative of the improvement cost function (fyt) has sufficiently low values, Eq. (17) has solution, and then improvement activities are at positive level, and productivity knowledge will grow. Otherwise, when the convex cost function f increases so rapidly that its derivative has no values to match the right-hand side, improvement activities are set to zero. The improvement activities are not efficient as their costs exceed benefits determined by the right-hand side.Proposition 3In undiscounted case (r=0, δ=1) productivity improvement efforts are decreasing over time. In discounted case (r>0) these improvement efforts are quasi convex when marginal benefits of improvement activities=-Dtcyttare decreasing over time and are quasi concave when these marginal benefits are increasing over time.The statements are proved in Appendix B. Similar findings for undiscounted cases are noted already in Li and Rajagopalan (1998). However, it is interesting to note that Carillo and Gaimon (2000) do not discount the generated revenue and salvaged value, and they are the first to mention the possibility of increasing improvement dynamics. We believe this observation comes from their assumption that process change can cause immediate loss in effective capacity.For discounted cases, the proposition gives the complete identification of forces that drives the dynamics of process improvement activities. It gives up the wisdom that the advantage of extensive investments at the beginning of the time horizon is the utilization of increased productivity knowledge through longer time periods, which fuels the belief that improvement activities should be decreasing over time.One of the important relationships determined in Appendix B by (B4) is thatfyt+1δ=Dtcytt+fyt.When δ=1(r=0), we havefyt+1<fytand because of strictly increasing convex f, yt+1<yt, i.e. decreasing improvement activities ifDtcytt<0. (However, in case of a catastrophic strategy,Dtcytt=0may occur. Positioning the product in an absolutely wrong way (when Dt=0), or utilizing the resources inefficiently (whencytt=0) can lead to this situation.)However in the discounted case, different types of dynamics can be identified. Relationship (B7) indicates that the discount rate, the salvage value, and theDtcyttvalues play role in setting the difference between two consecutive values of marginal costs of improvement. When the future looks nice, the hope of large salvage value spurs late investments. Similarly, high capital cost pushes investments closer to those late periods where knowledge is better utilized.When the current advantage of knowledge increase is relatively high, there is tendency for decreasing improvement efforts, but when future benefits are high, late investments are encouraged. The current and late benefits of the improvement efforts are determined by the dynamics of-Dtcytt, which is the total cost saving due to the increase of productivity knowledge. Three factors can be named that have large impact on the dynamics of the expression-Dtcytt. The term-cyttexpresses the magnitude with which operations contributes to the success of the business strategy, expresses what operations resources can do, and gives the operations perspective of operations strategy (Slack, Chambers, & Johnston, 2010). By Camillus (2008), the operational excellence based on cost efficiency is one of the most important strategic tools. If the company is outstanding in utilizing operational resources, the operations advantage can be the driving factor of the business strategy (Hayes, Pisano, Upton, & Wheelwright, 2005). The dynamics of Dtis influenced by both external and internal factors. When the product positioned and designed well, moreover the efficiency of operations allows using optimally low prices, demand will be large. Additionally, when competitors cannot imitate, copy or substitute the product – see the concept of Collis and Montgomery (1995) –, the company will have sustainable position, and there will be a tendency for an increasing dynamics for-Dtcytt. As always, Dtmay be strongly influenced by external factors, like the strength of competitors, or the general state of the economy.Thus a successful and sustainable business strategy results in increasing cost saving, which spurs intensive improvement activities over time. On the other hand, a decreasing series of-Dtcyttwill support the decreasing dynamics of the improvement activities. A double effect of efficient utilization of resources can be observed through (15). The efficient utilization of resources results in positive activities, and productivity knowledge will grow. As a result of this not only the unit production cost will drop, but price as well, which increases demand. Efficient operations create market this way, and finally-Dtcyttwill grow with larger extent. These thoughts are summarized by Table 1. As it has been indicated, the expected selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge and the cost of capital also influence the dynamics of the improvement activities.The next section explains that already a stable economic environment is enough to have decreasing dynamics of improvement activities. We suppose that a stable economic environment is expressed by the static parameters of the demand function. Actually, in most models when the tools of control theory are used, the parameters of demand functions do not change over time.To be able to compare the results of the previous section with those of optimal control models, we specify some functions in model (1). So, let the parameters of the demand function be the same in each period, i.e. Dt(pt)=D(pt), satisfying both (16) and D(c(q0))>0.From (15), let us suppose that the optimal price at period t is determined by the following function:pt=φ(qt),for allt,and letΩ(qt)=-aD(φ(qt))cqt.Then (17) takes the form in this case:(18)fyt=∑j=tTΩ(qj)δj-t+aPδT-t,t=1,2,…,TSupposing that both ytand yt+1 are positive, then this equation can be written as:(19)fyt=Ω(qt)+fyt+1δfort=1,2,…,T-1.Recall that in Model 1 f is strictly convex and we suppose for simplicity at=a.Proposition 4In a stable environment, when demand function parameters are time independent and the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero, the improvement rate is decreasing over time, and with positive salvage value, the dynamics may be quasi convex in Model 1. Moreover, if f(yt)=kyt, the nature of this dynamics is like described byProposition 2.Supposing that the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero at the end of the time horizon (P=0), let period t be the last one with positive improvement activities. Then based on (18), the equationfyt=Ω(qt)∑j=tTδj-thas solution with yt>0, and as this is maximum point, at the left-hand-side (right-hand-side) neighborhood of this yt, the marginal investment cost (fy) must be smaller (larger) than the marginal total cost saved due to improvementΩ(qt)∑j=tTδj-t. Applying (19) for period t−1 we can writefyt-1=Ω(qt-1)+fytδ.ytcan be positive, i.e. qtis larger than qt−1 if Ω(qt)<Ω(qt−1). Expressing Ω’s from the last two equations above, then ytcan be positive iffyt-1-fytδ>fyt∑j=tTδj-t.From thisfyt-1>fytδ+1∑j=tTδj-tfollows. It can be seen, thatδ+1∑j=tTδj-thas the lowest value for δ=0, which is one, for every t. Consequently,fyt-1>fytmust be true, which means that yt−1>yt. Writing (19) fort−2, yt−1 may be positive, i.e. qt−1>qt−2, iffyt-2-fyt-1δ>fyt-1-fytδ.From thisfyt-2>fyt-1+δ(fyt-1-fyt),which means thatfy-2>fyt-1, consequently yt−2>yt−1. Finally arriving at period one in similar way, we can say that improvement rates are decreasing over time. Let us note, that if period t is the last one with positive improvement rate, then there is no period between period 1 and t with zero improvement rate.We have also seen the role of salvage value in the proof of Proposition 2. According to this, depending on the value of P, improvement rate at the final period can be even larger than in previous periods. This event forms a quasi convex shape for the improvement rates.Like in Proposition 2, a similar analysis can be conducted when f(y)=ky, as the basic nature of the unit cost function and demand function has not changed.Let us note that at the model of Chand et al. (1996) the cost of improvement is formulated in the same way like in the Berstein and Kök (2009) model. In the Chand’s et al. (1996) model the system is normalized, model parameters do not depend on time, the salvage value (the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of the horizon) of the productivity knowledge is similarly set to zero, but an upper bound is inserted for capacity utilized jointly by production and improvement activities. The effectiveness of improvement activities is lower and lower as productivity knowledge converges to its upper bound, which is one(q̇(t)=y(t)(1-q(t))). The multi-period version of this assumption in the optimal control model can be formulated as:qt=qt-1+yt(1-qt),for allt.If we describe the accumulation of the productivity knowledge with the form(20)qt=qt-1+atyt,for allt,and we consider all possible outcomes of the parameter set atunder the assumption at⩽at−1, the merit should be similar. Applying (20) in (14b) we have∂L/∂yt=at∑j=tTD(φ(qj))cqjδj-fytδtfor allt,i.e. the marginal benefit of process improvement is worth less and less over time (with the increase of t) as the atseries is decreasing. As P=0, the P⩽kδ section of Proposition 2 can be implemented here. When y1 would reach its upper bound, this would mean that Φ(q)>k2, leaving room for y2 to be positive. These observations are in full harmony with the properties of the optimal control version developed by Chand et al. (1996).Based on this analysis, sometimes the dynamics of improvement activities follows from the model structure directly. It has been an important finding that when the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero at the end of the time horizon (salvage value of the accumulated knowledge is zero), additionally the parameters of the demand function are static over time, the dynamics of the improvement activities must be always decreasing. Additionally, if the investment cost is linear and static, improvement activities are at zero level over the time periods. At most, it may be positive at the first time period. Only a sufficiently high selling price of the productivity knowledge may change this rule, encouraging positive investment at the final period. Table 2below classifies models according to the expected dynamics of improvement activities depending on the types of functions used in model (1).Example 3Let the demand beDt=8e-ptfor each period, t=1,2,…,5. Moreover,c(qt)=2/qt,r=0.2,a=1,P=0,f(yt)=kytwhere k=3/4 for all t, and q0=1. As the parameters of the demand function are constant over time and the salvage value of the productivity knowledge is zero, the dynamics of improvement activities must decrease over time. Additionally, the investment cost function f is linear, thus there may be positive level improvement activity at the first period only. From (15) we have: pt−c(qt)=1, but as y2=y3=y4=y5=0, then q1=q2=⋯=q5, andpt=1+2/qtfollows for each t. Moreover,cy1j=cqj=cq1=-q1-3/2. Then Eq. (17) is the following:(21)3/4=-8e-1+2/q1q1-3/2(1+⋯+1/1.24).The solution of Eq. (21) is q1=2.5. As y1=q1−q0=2.5−1=1.5. Consequently, spending 1.5 unit time for improvement can be recommended at the first period, after that nothing. The price is 2.26 over the periods.Let the demand beDt=8e-ptfor each period, t=1, 2, andc(qt)=2/qt,r=0.2,a=1again. However, letf(yt)=yt2,P=9.4,q0=0, and T=2. Again, the price ispt=1+2/qtfor each t. Applying (17) for t=T,(22)2y2=8e-1+2/(y1+y2)(y1+y2)3+9.4,and for t=1:(23)2y1=8e-1+2/y1y13+8e-1+2/(y1+y2)(y1+y2)31.2+9.4/1.2Multiplying both sides of (23) with 1.2, and substituting the right-hand side of (22) into (23), we have(24)y2=1.2y1-4.8e-1+2/y1y13.The values y1=4, y2=4.72 is the solution of (22) and (24), which exhibits an increasing dynamics.Example 5 is the same as Example 4, except that the selling price of the accumulated knowledge is P=1.4. Instead of 9.4, applying P=1.4, the solution of (22) and (24) is y1=1, y2=0.96, which indicates a decreasing dynamics. Let us note that in both cases the price is decreasing and demand (production) is increasing.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper develops multi period models to characterize the dynamics of price and process improvement activity levels in order to find new properties. Interestingly, to analyze the property of process improvement activities, only optimal control models have been formulated, which tend to apply time independent demand functions. We have pointed out that in these models process improvement activities must be decreasing over time when the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero or sufficiently low at the end of the planning horizon. (Except in the Carillo–Gaimon model, where although the discount rate is zero, but process change can cause immediate losses.) For some special structures, particularly when the investment cost function is linear, explicit solutions are derived. These solutions indicate that process improvement activities are zero in intermediate periods, and are positive at the terminal period in case of an attractive salvage value. They are positive at the first period when process improvement is beneficial and the initial productivity knowledge is sufficiently low. For more general model structures those driving forces of process improvement dynamics are identified that finally determine the quasi convex or concave nature of improvement rates. Providing access among optimal control and multi period models the paper resolves contradicting reports on the nature of the dynamics of improvement activities. In most cases contradictions simply stem from different model assumptions.According to the findings, future expectations, capital cost, and dynamics of marginal total costs are the most important driving forces that directly shape and determine the quasi convex or concave nature of the improvement activities. However, the marginal total costs are mainly determined by the success of a business strategy. The marginal total cost has two major components: the demand and the marginal unit cost-the result of improvement efforts. If internal resources are utilized efficiently, there is significant cost saving due to productivity increase, and if additionally the positioning of the product is successful in the market, the demand may increase. These two components makes the dynamics of improvement rates quasi concave, indicating that it has sense to continue the utilization of accumulated knowledge further on. On the other hand, if improvement activities do not result in significant productivity increase, or demand rate decrease over time, the dynamics can be quasi convex. We showed also that time independent demand functions tend to exhibit this dynamics.The limitations of our models hopefully provide ground for further research. Although we have formulated rather general objective functions, the constraint set requires further analysis. We assumed that positive level of improvement activities always includes the increase of productivity knowledge, moreover this relationship is linear and deterministic. The relief of these assumptions may lead to interesting results. Similarly, besides cost, including further competitive priorities, like quality for example, may expand our knowledge.
