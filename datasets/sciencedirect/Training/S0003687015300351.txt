@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In traditional approaches of human reliability assessment (HRA), the definition of the error producing conditions (EPCs) and the supporting guidance are such that some of the conditions (especially organizational or managerial conditions) can hardly be included, and thus the analysis is burdened with incomprehensiveness without reflecting the temporal trend of human reliability. A method based on system dynamics (SD), which highlights interrelationships among technical and organizational aspects that may contribute to human errors, is presented to facilitate quantitatively estimating the human error probability (HEP) and its related variables changing over time in a long period. Taking the Minuteman III missile accident in 2008 as a case, the proposed HRA method is applied to assess HEP during missile operations over 50 years by analyzing the interactions among the variables involved in human-related risks; also the critical factors are determined in terms of impact that the variables have on risks in different time periods. It is indicated that both technical and organizational aspects should be focused on to minimize human errors in a long run.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
More and more industrial accidents involve human and organizational factors, in addition to failures or malfunctions that are taken as technical factors. The accidents occurring in recent years, such as Minuteman III missile accident in 2008 and Fukushima disaster in 2011, indicate that human activities and organizational aspects are playing increasingly critical roles in modern industrial operations, and unexpected human errors or ineffective organization can probably lead to severe output. It is fundamentally significant to take human errors into account more than in the past, when conducting safety assessment or accident investigation, but it has been increasingly challenging to assess human reliability due to the complexity and dynamics within socio-technical systems.Human reliability assessment (HRA) is often used to deal with the risks related to human errors (Boring and Bye, 2008; Boring et al., 2009; Ung and Shen, 2011), and one of the fundamental functions of HRA is to predict human error probability (HEP) (Gertman et al., 2005; van de Merwe et al., 2012). There are typical HRA methods, such as Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) (Williams, 1988) and Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) (Swain and Guttmann, 1983), which predict the HEP via analyzing and evaluating various factors influencing the human performance (termed here as Error Producing Conditions, EPCs). Thus the aspects that may contribute to human errors and the determination of various EPCs corresponding to the contributing aspects are the most important inputs for human reliability analysis process, which will hopefully be beneficial to the investigation of accidents especially involving human operations.Lee et al. (2013) describe the issues that should be considered in HEP estimation, and presented a method for quantifying human errors that can occur during operation executions and applied it to nuclear industry. Park (2008) suggests a method of HEP estimation referred as AHP-SLIM to overcome the lack of empirical data and thus to obtain a more accurate estimation. Sun et al. (2012) present a modified method of Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) to provide the point estimation of HEP for probabilistic safety assessment. Podofillini and Dang (2013) propose a method to empirically study the effect of an EPC on HEP to make sure that the definitions of the EPCs cover the influences important for HRA, and that the quantitative relationships among EPCs and error probability are adequately represented. However, one of the major limitations of the existing HRA methods in general is that few of them attempt to provide a causal picture of human errors (Groth and Mosleh, 2012), given the fact that the risk-contributing aspects interact with each other during the process rather than act independently. Another limitation is that most HRA methods are static analysis, and the calculated HEP is constant under given conditions. However, when considering the dynamic behaviors within a socio-technical system, the probability of a certain action is not necessarily stable but may vary enormously with organizational factors (e.g., management system, cost budget, and schedule target) or personal factors (e.g., safety awareness, time pressure, and physical rhythm) in addition to technical factors such as failures or degradations of equipment. The points above affect the comprehensive insight of human reliability as well as the model construction and verification for the calculation of HEP.Therefore, the conventional approaches are challenged and some methods are developed to efficiently derive the relationships among EPCs and the error probability. In order to gain a full understanding and comprehensive awareness of human error in socio-technical systems, it is necessary to use a systemic approach to consider all the aspects that may lead to accidents or hazardous events. “System Dynamics (SD) deals with the time-dependent behavior of managed systems, with the aim of describing the system and understanding, through qualitative and quantitative models, how information feedback governs its behavior, and designing robust information feedback structures and control policies through simulation and optimization.”(Dangelico et al., 2010) When analyzing human factors in accidents, SD can be taken as a means to depict the system behaviors, including the interactions among human errors and other human-related contributing factors, given the causes identified and causality of accident that are analyzed in our preliminary research elaborated in (Rong and Tian, 2015).As the follow-up work of (Rong and Tian, 2015), this article aims to contribute to HRA by proposing a temporal uncertainty analysis method of human errors that considers causality within a socio-technical system and produces quantitative assessment decisions. Such a method will be capable of accommodating modeling of all critical EPCs involved in a socio-technical system. The generic human error causal analysis method based on Systems Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes (STAMP) is proposed in (Rong and Tian, 2015), which is briefly reviewed here to clarify the context of the research in this article, also the motivation for connection between the qualitative analysis of accident and the quantitative assessment are expounded. To model and assess HEP, an SD flow chart with quantitative correlations between variables is developed in accordance with accident causality, and then based on simulation results, strategies of risk mitigation are suggested as well as verifications implemented.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Based on improvement to the conventional methods of HRA, a framework of HRA was built with focus on human-related contributing factors from the systemic and dynamic viewpoint, rather than the calculation of static HEP per se. According to the framework, SD approach was employed to model the interrelationships among the factors in missile operations that may contribute to accidents, in order to quantitatively analyze the migration of HEP over time, as well as to identify the factor(s) that might contribute dominantly to HEP in a long term (e.g., 50 years). This temporal uncertainty analysis explicitly reflects the long-term behavior of a socio-technical system with various human operations under the given conditions, and enables people to look at potential trade-offs between short-term profits and sustainable long-term improvement. Also, due to the prediction of the level of variables related to the contributing factors, the timing when the factors have significant impact on the system behaviors can be estimated, and taken as reference for decision-makers to determine what aspect should be given priority to when developing strategies for different time periods.Taking an accident of missile operations as a case, the long-term HEP and its contributing variables were analyzed. The tendency of the curves characterizes the long-term change of the variables' level, and assists in improving technical conditions and organizational aspects during missile operations. Through the simulations, the factors of Equipment Technology Level (technical aspect) and Personal Commitment to Safety (organizational aspect) are suggested being focused on to derive or improve requirements for missile operations. Besides, through the strategy tests, it is suggested that human errors decrease most effectively if advisable control in both technical and organizational aspects can be adopted simultaneously. It is concluded in the officially-issued accident report that the direct cause of the accident was related to a loose connection at the capacitor C101A of the battery charger inside A06's launcher equipment room (Walker, 2008), but there is a lack of further exploration for the causes of the equipment failure. By comparing the results in this study with the accident report, we are inspired that human errors in the operating process can be characterized in a global perspective and be quantitatively depicted during a long term, which is not discussed even in the official accident report but definitely makes much sense.More significantly, the idea that suggests examining dynamic characteristics of human activities (or human errors) by using SD can also apply to other types of socio-technical systems where human activities are involved and human errors are attached weight to, and the proposed method can be adopted given the corresponding causal relationship and data as inputs of modeling.Although the insight regarding temporal uncertainty analysis of human errors has contributed to HRA in the aspect of quantification of the qualitative causality model, there are limitations below in this work:1)The SD model is demonstrated with its two main parts, i.e., “human error” construct and “system” construct, but specific details about how to establish the constructs, particularly those for quantifying human-related accident causalities, are provided in a relatively simplified way. Consequently, the description of the interactions between human, organizational, social and physical elements of a real-world system has to depend largely on the way that the analysts look at the system, due to the simplified guidelines for modeling.In order to ensure a high credibility of the SD model representing a real-world system, a comprehensive method including qualitative and quantitative tests is needed to validate the model structure and behavior. The case study in this paper has illustrated how the proposed approach can help quantitatively analyze human errors, and explored the feasibility in risk mitigation strategies assessment. Yet a validity checking for SD model, as well as a data gathering method used for validation, has not been given at present due to the lack of historical data for modeling.The view in this method stays at a holistic level, with the focus on assessment of human errors by calculating HEP, and it has not shed more light on risk-related phenomena at the level of individual tasks or operation procedures. The lack of specific modeling of human operation errors may negatively affect the widespread application of this method in human behavior studies.The limitations of the proposed method give us new thoughts as a suggestion for our future study, and further efforts are needed to improve the method. Future work can be progressed in the investigation into the relationships modeling of social or technical factors within socio-technical systems, and the investigation result will hopefully support extension of the SD modeling, and subsequently bring stronger practicality in safety engineering. Efforts will also focus on the method of data collection and processing to the gathered data, so as to justify the SD model with less dependence on analysts' knowledge and bias. An alternative approach to gather data can be working directly with appropriate industry associations. Further work is also needed to enhance the human behavior modeling with the highlight on specific operation tasks, which will help with human error control at a deeper technical level.
