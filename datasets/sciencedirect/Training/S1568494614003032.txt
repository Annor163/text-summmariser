In this study, a new method is proposed for the exact analytical inverse mapping of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems with singleton and linear consequents where the input variables are described by using strong triangular partitions. These fuzzy systems can be decomposed into several fuzzy subsystems. The output of the fuzzy subsystem results in multi-linear form in singleton consequent case or multi-variate second order polynomial form in linear consequent case. Since there exist explicit analytical formulas for the solutions of first and second order equations, the exact analytical inverse solutions can be obtained for decomposable Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems with singleton and linear consequents. In the proposed method, the output of the fuzzy subsystem is represented by using the matrix multiplication form. The parametric inverse definition of the fuzzy subsystem is obtained by using appropriate matrix partitioning with respect to the inversion variable. The inverse mapping of each fuzzy subsystem can then easily be calculated by substituting appropriate parameters of the fuzzy subsystem into this parametric inverse definition. So, it becomes very easy to find the analytical inverse mapping of the overall Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy system by composing inverse mappings of all fuzzy subsystems. The exactness and the effectiveness of the proposed inversion method are demonstrated on trajectory tracking problems by simulations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The inversion of a system model has an important role in model based engineering applications. However, in general, it is not easy to obtain a mathematical model for nonlinear systems. Since fuzzy systems are universal approximators which can approximate any nonlinear function with an arbitrary degree of accuracy [1–5], they are easy and effective tools for modeling nonlinear systems. Therefore, the fuzzy model inversion is widely used especially in model based engineering applications [6–14].In literature, there are several methods which provide exact or approximate inverse solutions for fuzzy system models. The exactness of the solution is important in order to ensure stability or robustness of the process. However, the exact inversion methods need certain limitations on the fuzzy system to be inverted such as having monotonic rule bases, singleton consequents, invertibility property. On the other hand there are no such limitations for the approximate inversion methods.The inversion of a fuzzy system can be handled as an identification problem manner and the approximate inverse fuzzy model can be obtained directly by using the reverse input–output data of the system [15–17]. In a similar manner, the inversion of a system can also be handled as an optimization problem manner and the appropriate inversion variable minimizing error between the desired and the system output can be found by using iterative procedures such as Newton method [18], Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm [19], genetic algorithms [20], Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm [21]. In these iterative methods, it is difficult to guarantee the desired convergence in each sampling time for any nonlinear system. Therefore, sufficient convergence may not be obtained in each sampling time and this reduces the stability and the robustness of the process for practical implementations.On the other hand, the exact inverse fuzzy model of a fuzzy system can be obtained by using rule-by-rule inversion approach which permutes the antecedent and consequence parts of the fuzzy model [9,22–25]. This linguistic inversion approach is valid for the fuzzy models of which input variables are defined by using strong triangular fuzzy partitioning and rule consequents are singletons. Additionally, some invertibility conditions which involve the monotonicity of the entire rule base of the fuzzy model must be satisfied. These invertibility conditions guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the inverse solution. In [26], the exact inversion method which handles the inversion procedure partially is proposed for decomposable fuzzy systems. Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems of which input variables are defined by using strong triangular partition and the rule consequents are singletons can be decomposed into multi-linear subsystems [27]. In this method, the inverse solution for overall fuzzy system is obtained by calculating inverse solutions of its all subsystems individually. Therefore, there is no need to check the invertibility of the fuzzy system beforehand. However, this approach is valid only for decomposable fuzzy systems with singleton consequents. In [28], an exact inversion method which removes the necessity of the decomposability property is proposed for TS fuzzy systems with singleton consequents. The only limitation of this method is that the inversion variable must be represented by using piecewise linear membership functions. In [29], an analytical method is proposed for the exact inversion of TS fuzzy systems with linear consequents where the input variables are described using strong triangular partitions. In [30], the inversion method proposed in [28] is extended to the inversion of fuzzy systems with linear consequents.In this study, a new exact analytical inverse mapping method is proposed for TS fuzzy systems with singleton and linear consequents where the input variables are described by using strong triangular partitions. TS fuzzy systems having strong triangular partitions can be decomposed into several fuzzy subsystems. In the proposed method, the analytical formulation of the output of each fuzzy subsystem is derived by using the matrix multiplication form representation of decomposable TS fuzzy systems. This matrix multiplication form simplifies the mathematical representation of the overall TS fuzzy system and also its inversion procedure especially in the case of high number of input variables. The output of the fuzzy subsystem results in multi-linear form in singleton consequent case or multi-variate second order polynomial form in linear consequent case. Thus, first and second order equations are derived to be solved by using appropriate matrix partitioning for the fuzzy systems with singleton and linear consequents, respectively. Then, the parametric inverse definition of the fuzzy subsystem is obtained via analytical formulas. The inverse mapping of each fuzzy subsystem can then easily be calculated by substituting appropriate parameters of the fuzzy subsystem into this parametric inverse definition. So, it becomes very easy to find the analytical inverse mapping of the overall TS fuzzy system by composing inverse mappings of all fuzzy subsystems. Algorithms are also given for the practical implementation of the proposed inversion procedures. The exactness and effectiveness of the proposed inversion method are demonstrated on trajectory tracking problems by simulations.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Decomposition of TS fuzzy systems section, decomposition of TS fuzzy systems is briefly presented. In The exact inversion of decomposable TS fuzzy systems section, the proposed exact inversion method is introduced. In Simulation Studies section, simulation studies are given to show the exactness and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, conclusions are outlined in Conclusion section.The general rule structure of a TS fuzzy system with n input variables, xk∈Xk⊂ℜ, k=1, ..., n, and one output variable, y∈Y⊂ℜ, can be defined as [26](1)Ri1,i2,…,in:IFx1isA1i1andx2isA2i2and,…,andxnisAninTHENy=fi1,i2,…,inx1,x2,…,xnwhereAkik, k=1, …, n, is the fuzzy set defined for the input variable xkand fi1,i2,…,inis the consequent crisp function. When Nkfuzzy sets are used for the definition of xk,ik∈Ik=1,2,…,Nk, k=1, …, n, the complete rule base consists of N=∏k=1,…,nNkrules with the corresponding index set I=I1×I2×, …, ×In. In singleton and linear consequent cases, the crisp rule output functions are defined as fi1,i2,…,in=qi1,i2,…,inandfi1,i2,…,in=q0i1,i2,…,in+q1i1,i2,…,in⋅x1+⋯+qni1,i2,…,in⋅xn, respectively. Here,qji1,i2,…,in(j=0, …, n), are the coefficients of output crisp functions.Strong triangular fuzzy partition is commonly used in fuzzy system design for the definition of input variables. Because, such fuzzy partitions are easy to construct, have a clear interpretation and, most importantly, are sufficient for modeling complex highly nonlinear systems [31].When strong triangular fuzzy partition shown in Fig. 1is used for the definition of input variables, each universe of discourseXk=[ak1,akNk], k=1, …, n can be considered as the union of Nk−1 intervals defined by two consecutive model values as(2)Xk=⋃ik=1,…,Nk−1akik,akik+1k=1,…,nwhereakikis the modal value of the linguistic termAkikand always two fuzzy setsAkikandAkik+1are fired for any crisp value of xksatisfying that(3)Akik(xk)+Akik+1(xk)=1In this way, the multi-dimensional universe of discourse X=X1×⋯Xncan be viewed as the union of each fuzzy mesh Xi1,i2,…,indefined as(4)Xi1,i2,…,in=[a1i1,a1i1+1]×⋯×[anin,anin+1]ik=1,…,Nk−1,k=1,…,nwhere × denotes the cartesian product. Thus, TS fuzzy system can be decomposed into fuzzy subsystems TSi1,i2,…,indescribed by the following 2nrules(5)Rv1,v2,…,vni1,i2,…,in:IFx1isA1i1+v1andx2isA2i2+v2and…andxnisAnin+vnTHENy=fi1+v1,i2+v2,…,in+vnx1,x2,…,xnvk∈0,1,k=1,…,nHere, i1, i2, …, inindicates the fuzzy subsystem to which the rule belongs andv1,v2,…,vndenotes an activated rule of the considered fuzzy subsystem.Due to this decomposability property, for any input vector x∈Xi1,i2,…,in, the output of TS fuzzy system is always generated by only one of its fuzzy subsystems, that is(6)TS(x)=TSi1,i2,…,in(x)The decomposability property provides a simple way in the synthesis of fuzzy systems [27].Depending on the strong triangular partition, the output of TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents yscis defined as(7)ysc=TSsc(x)=∑i1,i2,…,in∈IAi1,i2,…,in(x)×qi1,i2,…,inwhereAi1,i2,…,in(x)=∏k=1,…,nAkik(xk). Similarly, the output of TS fuzzy system with linear consequents ylcis defined as follows(8)ylc=TSlc(x)=∑i1,i2,…,in∈IAi1,i2,…,in(x)×(q0i1,i2…,in+q1i1,i2…,in×x1+⋯+qni1,i2…,in×xn)Firstly, we represent the output of a fuzzy subsystem by using the method given in [31]. This method defines the output of a fuzzy subsystem in matrix multiplication form which simplifies the mathematical representation of the overall TS fuzzy system especially in the case of having high number of input variables. Here we proposed a new exact inversion method using this matrix representation based approach in order to construct inverse mapping of TS fuzzy systems.The output of the fuzzy subsystemTSsci1,i2,…,inof a TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents for x∈Xi1,i2,…,inis formulated in multi-linear form as follows [31](9)TSsci1,i2,…,in(x)=gnT(x)(Ωi1,i2,…,inT)−1qi1,i2,…,inwhere g(x) is called as the generator vector and contains 2ncomponents being elements of the polynomial (1+x1)×⋯×(1+xn) written in the expanded additive form, Ω is called as the fundamental matrix and contains as elements the values of the generator g as follows(10)Ω=[g(γ1),…,g(γ2n)]2n×2nHere,γj∈a1i1,a1i1+1×…×anin,anin+1, j=1, …2n, ik=1, …, Nk−1, k=1, …n is the element of cartesian product of boundary values of the related interval in the universe of discourse.q=[q1,q2,…,q2n]Tis the vector containing consequent parameters of the related rules of the fuzzy subsystemTSsci1,i2,…,in.When linear consequents are used in TS fuzzy systems, the consequent function of the rule i1, i2, …, incan be rewritten as follows(11)y=fi1,i2,…,in(x)=qi,0qi,1qi,2…qi,n1xi=1,…,2nwhere x=[x1, x2, …, xn]T, and qi,j(i=1, …, 2n, j=1, …, n) is the coefficient of the rule consequent function related to each input.In the same way, the output of TS fuzzy system with linear consequents generated by the fuzzy subsystemTSlci1,i2,…,inis formulated as the following multivariate polynomial(12)TSlci1,i2,…,in(x)=gnT(x)(Ωi1,i2,…,inT)−1Qi1,i2,…,in1xHere, Qi1,i2,…,inis the matrix containing the coefficients of the rule consequent functions of the active rules as(13)Q=q1,0q1,1…q1,nq2,0q2,1…q2,n⋮⋮⋱⋮q2n,0q2n,1…q2n,nThe fundamental matrix Ω is non-singular if and only ifakik+1−akik≠0[31], which is always guaranteed due to strong triangular partitioning. Therefore, the inverse of the fundamental matrix Ω−1 always exists.As the number of input variables increases, the computational complexity and the algorithm construction difficulty emerge in the practical implementations of TS fuzzy systems. The most important property of the generator vector g and the inverse of the fundamental matrix Ω−1 (also Ω) is that they can be computed recursively as follows(14)gk+1=gkxk+1gk(15)Ωk+1−1=1Lk+1ak+1ik+1+1−1−ak+1ik+11⊗Ωk−1k=0,1,…,n−1where g0=1 andΩ0−1=1,Lk=akik+1−akikis the length of the ikth interval in the universe of discourse of xkand ⊗ is the Kronecker product. Therefore, the inversion of the fundamental matrix can easily be computed recursively using only multiplication operations instead of complex classical matrix inversion procedures. This property simplifies the algorithm construction procedure for TS fuzzy systems having large number of inputs and also substantially reduces the problem of the curse of dimensionality in fuzzy systems.Consider a TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents defined in (1). Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the inversion variable is xn.The output definition of the fuzzy subsystemTSsci1,i2,…,inin (9) can be rewritten as(16)TSsci1,i2,…,in(x)=gnT(x)Ksci1,i2,…,inwhereKsci1,i2,…,in=(Ωi1,i2,…,inT)−1qi1,i2,…,in. The matrices can be expressed in the following partitioned forms(17)g(x)=gn=[gn−1](2n/2)×1xn[gn−1](2n/2)×12n×1(18)Ksci1,i2,…,in=[K1i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×1[K2i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×12n×1Then, the output ofTSsci1,i2,…,incan be written as follows(19)TSsci1,i2,…,in(x)=gn−1Txngn−1TK1i1,i2,…,inK2i1,i2,…,in=ai1,i2,…,in+xnbi1,i2,…,in.whereai1,i2,…,in=gn−1TK1i1,i2,…,inandbi1,i2,…,in=gn−1TK2i1,i2,…,in. Thus, the inverse solution is obtained as(20)xn=TSsci1,i2,…,in−ai1,i2,…,inbi1,i2,…,inSince all input variables except xnare known, the fired related intervalsi1*,i2*,…,in−1*in the universes of discourse are all known as well. However, it is not known which interval for the inversion variable is fired. Therefore, all fuzzy subsystemsTSsci1*,i2*,…,in−1*,in(in=1, …, Nn−1) must be evaluated separately in order to find the exact inverse solution(s) of TS fuzzy system. In this case, there will be p=Nn−1 possible candidate solutions. Within these candidates, only the ones which fall intointhin=1,…,Nn−1interval of the current evaluated fuzzy subsystemTSsci1*,i2*,…,in−1*,inconstitute the valid solution set. The final solution set can contain unique, multiple, infinity and/or no solution(s). In the case of multiple solutions, a selection criterion is needed to determine one of the solutions for implementation purposes. In this study, the minimal energy (minimal distance) criterion is chosen to prevent abrupt switching and ensure control signal continuity [14]. According to this criterion, the inverse solution is selected as to be the nearest to inverse solution at previous sampling time.It is very obvious that as the number of input variables and fuzzy partitions increases the number of fuzzy subsystems in TS fuzzy system will also increase. However, the computational complexity of the proposed inversion procedure will not increase correspondingly. Since the output definition of a fuzzy subsystem does not change, the inverse solution for each subsystem can easily be obtained only by substituting appropriateakik,akik+1and qi,jvalues into the relevant equation.As it is seen from (20), the existence of the inverse solution depends on the denominator bi1,i2,…,inof the equation. In the case that bi1,i2,…,in=0, if ai1,i2,…,in≠0, then there exists no solution for the inversion procedure. On the other hand, if ai1,i2,…,in=0, then there exists infinite number of solutions which means that the solution set is the whole interval of the evaluated fuzzy partition, that isSi1*,i2*,…,in−1*,in=xni1*,i2*,…,in−1*,in=[aninanin+1].The algorithm for the practical implementation of the inversion of decomposable TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents is given in Appendix.Consider a TS fuzzy system with linear consequents whose rule structure is defined in (1). Here, it is again assumed that the inversion variable is xn.The output definition of the fuzzy subsystemTSlci1,i2,…,inin (12) can be rewritten as(21)TSlci1,i2,…,in(x)=gnT(x)Klci1,i2,…,in1xwhereKlci1,i2,…,in=(Ωi1,i2,…,inT)−1Qi1,i2,…,in. The matrices can be expressed in the following partitioned forms(22)g(x)=gn=[gn−1](2n/2)×1xngn−1(2n/2)×12n×1(23)Klci1,i2,…,in=[K11i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×n[K12i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×1[K21i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×n[K22i1,i2,…,in](2n/2)×12n×(n+1)(24)1x=[Lx]n×1[xn]1×1(n+1)×1where Lx=[1, x1, x2, …, xn−1]T. Then, the output of the fuzzy subsystem can be written as follows(25)TSlci1,i2,…,in(x)=[gn−1Txngn−1T]K11i1,i2,…,inK12i1,i2,…,inK21i1,i2,…,inK22i1,i2,…,inLxxn=gn−1TK11i1,i2,…,inLx+xngn−1TK21i1,i2,…,inLx+xngn−1TK12i1,i2,…,in+xn2gn−1TK22i1,i2,…,inAfter certain arrangements the following quadratic equation is obtained(26)xn2gn−1TK22i1,i2,…,in+xn(gn−1T(K21i1,i2,…,inLx+K12i1,i2,…,in))+(gn−1TK11i1,i2,…,inLx−TSlci1,i2,…,in)=0Thus, the inverse solution is obtained as(27)xn1,2=−bi1,i2,…,in±Δi1,i2,…,in2ai1,i2,…,inwhere(28)ai1,i2,…,in=gn−1TK22i1,i2,…,in(29)bi1,i2,…,in=gn−1T(K21i1,i2,…,inLx+K12i1,i2,…,in)(30)Δi1,i2,…,in=(bi1,i2,…,in)2−4ai1,i2,…,inci1,i2,…,in(31)ci1,i2,…,in=gn−1TK11i1,i2,…,inLx−TSlci1,i2,…,inThe inverse solution is defined in a unique form for each subsystem as in singleton consequent case. Since the fired interval of the inversion variable related to the output valueTSlci1,i2,…,inis not known a priori, all subsystems related to each interval of the universe of discourse of the inversion variable must be evaluated separately. This will cause p=Nn−1 pair of possible candidate solutions. The valid solution set consists of the real valued candidate solutions that fall intointh(in=1, …, Nn−1) interval of the current evaluated fuzzy subsystemTSlci1*,i2*,…,in−1*,in.As it is seen from (27), the existence of the inverse solution is related to the denominator ai1,i2,…,inof the equation. In the case of ai1,i2,…,in=0, the quadratic Eq. (26) turns out to be the linear equation as follows(32)xn(gn−1T(K21i1,i2,…,inLx+K12i1,i2,…,in))+(gn−1TK11i1,i2,…,inLx−TSlci1,i2,…,in)=0Thus, the inverse solution of TS fuzzy system with linear consequents is obtained as(33)xn=(TSlci1,i2,…,in−gn−1TK11i1,i2,…,inLx)(gn−1T(K21i1,i2,…,inLx+K12i1,i2,…,in))=−ci1,i2,…,inbi1,i2,…,inSince the numerator and the denominator of (33) are linear equations, the existence of the solution for the TS fuzzy system with linear consequents becomes related to the same existence conditions of TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents.The algorithm for the inversion procedure of decomposable TS fuzzy system with linear consequents is given in Appendix.It is important to note that since decomposable TS fuzzy systems are the special case of more freely designed TS fuzzy systems handled in [30] (note that in [28,29], only the special cases of [30] are dealt), the inversion method given in [30] inherently provides the same exact inverse solutions for decomposable TS fuzzy systems. However, the proposed method differs from [26,30] by providing the following advantages.Firstly, in the proposed method, a quite different formulation is derived for the inversion procedure of decomposable TS fuzzy systems by using matrix calculus. Due to this new formulation, the inverse solutions are obtained in a more simple and straightforward way. Secondly, in the case of high number of input variables, the problem of curse of dimensionality arises for the inversion methods presented in [26,30]. On the other hand, this problem is substantially reduced in the proposed inversion method since the generator vector and the inverse of the fundamental matrix are calculated recursively. Thirdly, the proposed inversion procedure can be implemented more easily due to its compact formulation. Finally, a lookup table can easily be generated a priori for the generator vector and the inverse of the fundamental matrix with respect to the different number of input variables. In this way, the recursive calculations of the generator vector and the inverse of the fundamental matrix are removed and therefore, the computations can be further simplified. All these advantages make the proposed exact inversion method superior to the other exact inversion methods presented in [26,30] if TS fuzzy system is decomposable.Here, the exactness and the effectiveness of the proposed inversion method are demonstrated through trajectory tracking simulations. The control signal that will drive the fuzzy system output to the desired trajectory is determined by using the proposed inversion algorithm in the controller. Without loss of generality, the number of input variable of TS fuzzy system is chosen as n=2 in order to simplify the explanation and understanding. Because, in the case of n>2, it is difficult to show graphical representations and same calculations are repeated recursively. The open loop control block diagram is illustrated in Fig. 2.Since the open loop control system is given for the validation of the exactness of the proposed inversion method, the disturbance and noise effects that are unavoidable in the real time control applications are not taken into consideration. These unavoidable effects can be overcome by using feedback stabilizer filters as in internal model control strategies.Consider two input single output TS fuzzy system with singleton consequents given in Fig. 3a[26]. The corresponding decomposition and the input–output mapping of the fuzzy system from which the decomposition can easily observed are given in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. It is assumed that the inversion variable is x2.In order to obtain the exact inverse mapping of the fuzzy system, the exact inversion of each fuzzy subsystem must be calculated. Since the number of inputs is n=2, the generator vector which is the same for all subsystems is calculated as follows(34)g(x)=g2=g1x2g1where (g0=1)(35)g1=g0x1g0=1x1The parametric definition of the inverse of the fundamental matrix(ΩT)−1which is the same for all subsystems is calculated recursively as follows(36)(Ω0i1,i2T)−1=1(Ω1i1,i2T)−1=1L1a1i1+1−1−a1i11T⊗(Ω0i1,i2T)−1=1(a1i1+1−a1i1)a1i1+1−1−a1i11T(Ω2i1,i2T)−1=1L2a2i2+1−1−a2i21T⊗(Ω1i1,i2T)−1=1(a2i2+1−a2i2)(a1i1+1−a1i1)a1i1+1a2i2+1−a2i2+1−a1i1+11−a1i1a2i2+1a2i2+1a1i1−1−a1i1+1a2i2a2i2a1i1+1−1a1i1a2i2−a2i2−a1i11TTherefore, the inverse of the fundamental matrix is easily obtained substituting related boundary pointsakikandakik+1(k=1, 2, ik=1, 2) for each subsystem.After the generator vector and the inverse of the fundamental matrices are determined, it is easy to obtain the exact inversion of each fuzzy subsystem. When TS1,1 is considered, the consequent parameter vector isq1,1=−2,0,2,1Tand the inverse of the fundamental matrix is calculated by using (36) as(37)(Ω21,1T)−1=1(0−(−2))(0−(−1))=(0)(0)−(0)−(0)1−(−2)(0)(0)(−2)−1−(0)(−1)(−1)(0)−1(−2)(−1)−(−1)−(−2)1T=12000100−2−10−10−12121TK1,1 matrix is calculated as follows(38)K1,1=(Ω1,1T)−1q1,1=12000100−2−10−10−12121T−2021=1−0.51−1.5Thus, the partitioned matrices of K1,1 are(39)K11,1=1−0.5(40)K21,1=1−1.5Then, the inverse mapping definition of TS1,1 in terms of x2 is obtained as(41)x21,1=TS1,1−g1TK11,1g1TK21,1=TS1,1−[1x1]1−0.5[1x1]1−1.5=TS1,1+0.5x1−1−1.5x1+1The inverse mappings of the other fuzzy subsystems are obtained by using the same procedure. The inverse mapping of the overall TS fuzzy system with respect to x2 is shown in Fig. 4.In order to show the different kinds of solutions encountered in the inversion procedure such as unique, multiple, infinity and/or no solution, the example solutions with respect to chosen x1 and the desired ydpoints are given in Table 1.The graphical representations of the inverse solutions obtained in Table 1 are shown in Fig. 5.Now let the desired output trajectory of the fuzzy system be chosen asyd(k)=0.25sin2πk100+0.75. Here, as an extreme case, x1 is chosen to be a random number uniformly distributed in [−2,2] as shown in Fig. 6a in order to show the exactness and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Considering multiple solutions, the minimal energy selection criterion is used to choose appropriate x2 value from the solution set.The obtained x2 inverse solutions with respect to given ydand x1 signals are shown in Fig. 6b. The comparison of the desired trajectory and the system output obtained by applying determined x2 signal is shown in Fig. 6c. As it is seen from Fig. 6c, the system output follows the desired trajectory exactly with zero error.Consider the previous example where only the crisp consequents of TS fuzzy system have been changed to linear consequents [29]. The rule table and the input–output mapping of the fuzzy system are shown in Table 2and Fig. 7, respectively.Since the same antecedent fuzzy sets are used, the generator vector and the inverses of the fundamental matrices(Ωi1,i2T)−1will not change. The x and Lxvector which are the same for all fuzzy subsystems are as follows(42)x=[x1,x2]T(43)Lx=1x1Thus, it remains only to construct the consequent parameter matrix Qi1,i2for each fuzzy subsystem. The consequent parameter matrix of TS1,1 is(44)Q1,1=q1,0q1,1…q1,nq2,0q2,1…q2,n⋮⋮⋮q2n,0q2n,1…q2n,n=−10.5−0.5−0.21.40.90.1−0.51−0.5−0.8−0.1Then K1,1 matrix is calculated as follows(45)Then, the inverse mapping definition of TS1,1 in terms of x2 is obtained as(46)x21,21,1=−(−0.4−3.45x1−0.6x12)±Δ1,12(−1−1.25x1)where(47)Δ1,1=(b1,1)2−4a1,1c1,1=(−0.4−3.45x1−0.6x12)2−4(−1−1.25x1)(−0.5−1.1x1−0.15x12−TS1,1)The inverse mappings of the other fuzzy subsystems are obtained with the same procedure as followsInversion of TS1,2(48)x21,21,2=−(1.2+0.7x1−0.6x12)±Δ1,22(0.6+0.05x1)where(49)Δ1,2=(b1,2)2−4a1,2c1,2=(1.2+0.7x1−0.6x12)2−4(0.6+0.05x1)(−0.5−1.1x1−0.15x12−TS1,2)Inversion of TS2,1(50)x21,22,1=−b2,1±Δ2,12a2,1=−(−0.4−2.4x1+0.95x12)±Δ2,12(−1+0.4x1)where(51)Δ2,1=(b2,1)2−4a2,1c2,1=(−0.4−2.4x1+0.95x12)2−4(−1+0.4x1)(−0.5−0.3x1+0.2x12−TS2,1)Inversion of TS2,2(52)x21,22,2=−b2,2±Δ2,22a2,2=−(1.2+1.05x1−0.55x12)±Δ2,22(0.6−0.1x1)where(53)Δ2,2=(b2,2)2−4a2,2c2,2=(1.2+1.05x1−0.55x12)2−4(0.6−0.1x1)(−0.5−0.3x1+0.2x12−TS2,2)Some example solutions with respect to chosen x1 and the desired ydpoints are given in Table 3.The graphical representations of the solution sets given in Table 3 are shown in Fig. 8.In the simulation, the desired output trajectory of the system is chosen asyd(k)=0.25sin2πk100+0.4and x1 is chosen as a random number uniformly distributed in [–2,2] as shown in Fig. 9a. The minimal energy selection criterion is used again due to the multiple solutions. In this case, the calculated x2 values with respect to given ydand x1 signals are shown in Fig. 9b. The comparison of the desired trajectory and the obtained system output is shown in Fig. 9c.As it is seen from Fig. 9c, the system output and the desired trajectory are exactly the same.
