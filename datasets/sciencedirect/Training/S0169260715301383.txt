@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Non-local means denoising filter has been established as gold standard for image denoising problem in general and particularly in medical imaging due to its efficiency. However, its computation time limited its applications in real world application, especially in medical imaging. In this paper, a distributed version on parallel hybrid architecture is proposed to solve the computation time problem and a new method to compute the filters’ coefficients is also proposed, where we focused on the implementation and the enhancement of filters’ parameters via taking the neighborhood of the current voxel more accurately into account. In terms of implementation, our key contribution consists in reducing the number of shared memory accesses. The different tests of the proposed method were performed on the brain-web database for different levels of noise. Performances and the sensitivity were quantified in terms of speedup, peak signal to noise ratio, execution time, the number of floating point operations. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, the implementation is compared to that of other techniques, recently published in the literature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image denoising is an operation that aims to reduce noise and to preserve features. Reducing noise on images can be used as a post or pre-processing step, often desirable when the signal to noise ratio is low as in ultrasound imaging (US), medium in the case of low-dose CT scan, high in magnetic resonance images (MRI) [26].The present trends in the field of medical imaging, and particularly 3D imaging modalities, with high resolutions represent an important challenge for the processing of these big block of data. In order to archive real-time objectives the algorithms should be parallelized and mapped in an optimal way onto state-of-art parallel processing architectures i.e. [30]. This work is dedicated to the enhancement of a data parallel version of the Non-Local Means (NL-Means) filter proposed by Buades et al.  [7].The proposed algorithm was validated on Brainweb database [1] and the obtained results show that the processing can be done in more practical time frames. Indeed, the NL-Means is a powerful algorithm that can potentially uses massive amounts of information in filtering each pixel of an image. However, the main drawback of the NL-Means filter resides in computational cost. A number of recent papers propose many improvements of the NL-Means filter [6,12,14–16,19,20,22–24,27,29,33–35].Furthermore, the nonlocal means filter was widely applied to different kind of medical images as in ultrasound images [13,17], and in computed tomography [10,11]. A review of all applications will be too consuming, we suggest to the reader these Refs.  [18,21,31].In this paper, we propose to hybridize a pre-selection procedure and a symmetric weight method to reduce the execution time. In addition, an implementation scheme on a HPC (High performance Computing) platform is proposed.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we state the problem addressed by this work, and present related work. The proposed method is exposed in Section 3. In Section 4 the parallel implementation is detailed, while the experimental results, discussion, and comparison study are in Section 5. Section 6 ends the paper.
