@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In modern manufacturing industry, developing automated tool condition monitoring system become more and more import in order to transform manufacturing systems from manually operated production machines to highly automated machining centres. This paper presents a nouvelle cutting tool wear assessment in high precision turning process using type-2 fuzzy uncertainty estimation on acoustic Emission. Without understanding the exact physics of the machining process, type-2 fuzzy logic system identifies acoustic emission signal during the process and its interval set of output assesses the uncertainty information in the signal. The experimental study shows that the development trend of uncertainty in acoustic emission signal corresponds to that of cutting tool wear. The estimation of uncertainties can be used for proving the conformance with specifications for products or auto-controlling of machine system, which has great meaning for continuously improvement in product quality, reliability and manufacturing efficiency in machining industry.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Because the information obtained during machining process is vague, incomplete or imprecise, conventional methods need a large number of cutting experiments and additional assumptions in many circumstances for effective uncertainty handling. These requirements reduce the reliability of the models and increase the money and time consuming. Artificial intelligence methods have played an important role in modern tool condition monitoring (TCM) to observe the relation between tool wear and acoustic emission (AE) signal such as neural networks [1,2], fuzzy system [3–5] and fuzzy neural network [6–10]. The increased use of artificial intelligence within TCM has enabled the development of more robust and comprehensive strategies.Fuzzy logic has been originally proposed by Zadeh in his famous paper “Fuzzy Sets” in 1965 [11]. Fuzzy logic provides a simple way to obtain a definite conclusion based upon vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy, or missing input information [12]. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy logic system (FLS) [13,14] was proposed in an effort to develop a systematic approach to generate fuzzy rules from a given input-output data set. This model consists of rules with fuzzy antecedents and a mathematical function in the consequent part. The antecedents divide the input space into a set of fuzzy regions, while consequents describe behaviour of the system in those regions. TSK FLS has a powerful capability of explaining complex relations among variables using rule consequents which are functions of the input variables.Based on Zadeh's conception of type-2 fuzzy sets and extension principle [15], practical algorithms for conjunction, disjunction and complementation operations of type-2 fuzzy sets were obtained by extending previous studies [16]. By using the discrete probability theory, embedded interval valued type-2 fuzzy sets was introduced and it made type-2 fuzzy sets easy to understand and explain [17–21]. A general formula was developed for the extended composition of type-2 relations which is considered as an extension of the type-1 composition [22]. Based on this formula, a complete type-2 fuzzy logic theory with the handling of uncertainties was established [23]. The characterization in the definition of type-2 fuzzy sets uses the notion that type-1 fuzzy sets can be thought of as a first order approximation to uncertainty and, therefore, type-2 fuzzy sets provides a second order approximation. First order type-2 TSK FLS and its structures were presented in 1999 [24]. High order type-2 TSK FLS can be found in [25,26]. Because of its larger number of design parameters for each rule, it was believed that type-2 FLS have the potential to be used in control [27] and other areas where a type-1 model may be unable to perform well [28,29] Recent Industrial applications of type-2 fuzzy sets and systems are reviewed in [30]. Application of type-2 fuzzy logic in TCM can be found in [31–33].The aim of this paper is to present an innovative cutting tool wear assessment in high precision hard turning process using type-2 fuzzy uncertainty estimation on acoustic Emission. Type-2 TSK fuzzy approach is not only model the high complex non-linear physical machining processes, but also estimate the ambiguities and uncertainties associated with AE. In this paper, type-2 TSK fuzzy modelling filter the raw AE signal directly from the AE sensor during turning process. Its interval set of output assesses the information of uncertainty in AE, which is of great value to investigate the complicated tool wear condition during machining process.This paper is divided into four sections. In Section 1, a brief review of previous studies on intelligent TCM and FLS is given. The description of the fundamentals and learning algorithm of TSK fuzzy approach is in Section 2. A high precision hard turning process experimental case study is in Section 3. Type-2 TSK fuzzy approach is used to filter the raw AE signal directly from the AE sensor and identify the uncertainty interval of AE. The sufficient information from AE uncertainty scheme is used to investigate tool condition so as to enhance the reliability of tool wear. The experimental results show the effectiveness and advantages of type-2 TSK fuzzy modelling. Section 4 is the conclusion and future research direction.A generalized kth rule in a first-order type-2 TSK fuzzy MISO system can be expressed asIF x1 isQ∼1kand x2 isQ2k∼and … and xnisQ∼nk,THEN Z isw∼k=p∼0k+p∼1kx1+p∼2kx2+⋯+p∼nkxnwhereQ∼1k,Q∼2k, …,Q∼nkare type-2 fuzzy sets on universe of discourses.w∼kis the output from the kth IF–THEN rule in a total of m rules FLS,p∼0k,p∼1k, …,p∼nkare consequent parameters. Detailed type-2 fuzzy sets and interval type-2 FLS background material can be found in [34].To obtain a type-2 fuzzy system directly from its type-1 counterpart, type-1 fuzzy membership functions (MFs) are considered as principal MFs of type-2 MFs. A widthajkofxjk*is extended to both directions of cluster centrexjk*as shown in Fig. 1. By so, cluster centre is expanded from a certain point to a fuzzy number:(1)x∼jk*=[xjk*(1−ajk),xjk*(1+ajk)]whereajkis spread percentage of cluster centrexjk∗as shown in Fig. 1. The cluster centrexjk∗becomes a constant width interval valued fuzzy setx∼jk*.Consequent parameterp∼jkis obtained by extending the consequent parameterpjkfrom its type-1 counterpart using the following expression:(2)p∼jk=[pjk−sjk,pjk+sjk],where j∈[0, n].sjkdenotes the spread of fuzzy numbersp∼jk, andsjk=bjk×pjk,bjkis spread percentage of consequent parameter.Hence, the premise MF is a type-2 fuzzy set, i.e.,(3)Q∼jk=exp−12xj−xjk∗(1±ajk)σjk2whereσjkis the standard deviation of Gaussian MF.Type-2 FLSs are very useful in circumstances in which it is difficult to determine an exact membership function for a fuzzy set. They can be used to handle rule uncertainties and even measurement uncertainties. To date, type-2 FL moves in progressive ways where type-1 FL is eventually replaced or supplemented by type-2 FL [35].Consequent parameters are obtained by expanding consequent parameterspjkin its type-1 counterpart to fuzzy numbers.(4)p∼jk=pjk(1±bjk)wherebjkis the spread percentage of fuzzy numbersp∼jk.For the most general structure of type-2 TSK FLS, antecedents are type-2 fuzzy sets and consequents are type-1 fuzzy sets. Membership grades are interval sets, i.e.,(5)μvk=[μ_vk,μ¯vk]whereμ_vkandμ¯vkare the lower value and upper value of the vth input variable in the kth rule.The explicit dependence of the total firing interval for kth rule can be computed as:(6)f_k=μ_1k(x1)∩μ_2k(x2)∩⋯∩μ_nk(xn)(7)f¯k=μ¯1k(x1)∩μ¯2k(x2)∩⋯∩μ¯nk(xn)where variablef_kandf¯kdenote lower value and upper value of fire strength. The symbol ∩ is a conjunction operator, which is a T-norm. It can be either MIN operator ∧ or product operator *.The interval value of the consequent of the kth rulewkiswk=[wlk,wrk], where(8)wlk=∑j=1ncjkxj+c0k−∑j=1nsjk|xj|−s0k(9)wlk=∑j=1ncjkxj+c0k+∑j=1nsjk|xj|+s0kHerewlkandwrkdenote lower and upper values of consequent output for kth rule.cjkandsjkdenotes the centre (mean) and the spread of fuzzy numberp∼jk.So, the extended output can be calculated by using following equation:(10)w∼=[wl,wr]=∫w1∈[wl1,wr1]...∫wn∈[wln,wrn]∫f1∈[f_1,f¯1]...∫fM∈[f_M,f¯M]1∑k=1Mfkwk/∑k=1MfkHencew∼=[wl,wr]is an interval type-1 set, the two endpointswlandwrcan be obtained by use equations below:(11)wl=∑k=1nflkwlk∑k=1nflk,wr=∑k=1nfrkwrk∑k=1nfrkThis interval set of the output has the information about the uncertainties that are associated with the crisp output, and this information can only be obtained by working with type-2 TSK FLS. To computew∼, it is two end-pointswlandwrmust be computed.In order to computewlandwr,flkandfrkhave to be determined.wlandwrcan be obtained by using the iterative procedure KM Algorithm[23].In an interval type-2 TSK FLS, outputw∼is an interval type-1 fuzzy set, so the crisp output of any interval type-2 TSK FLS can be obtained by using the average value ofwlandwr, i.e.,(12)w*=wl+wr2The diagram of type-2 TSK fuzzy modelling algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. This algorithm is initially presented in [36]. Type-2 TSK fuzzy approach includes two steps. The first step is type-1 fuzzy modelling to eliminate noise components in the AE signal and the second consists of expanding the type-1 fuzzy system to its type-2 counterpart to obtain the information of uncertainty in AE signal. In the first step, subtractive clustering method combined with a least-square estimation algorithm is used to cope with the nonlinearity of the AE and the uncertainty of imprecise data from measurement. A detailed description for this type-1 fuzzy modelling can be found in [37,38]. In the second step, the type-1 MFs is considered as the principal MFs of a type-2 FLS, the antecedent MFs are extended as interval type-2 fuzzy memberships by assigning uncertainty to cluster centres, and the consequent parameters are extended as fuzzy numbers by assigning uncertainty to consequent parameter values. Through enumerative search of optimum values of spreading percentage of cluster centres and consequent parameters, the best approach for analysing AE signal is obtained. Detailed description for this method can be found in [39].As mentioned, to obtain an efficient cutting tool wear assessment in high precision hard turning process using type-2 fuzzy uncertainty estimation on AE. This following case study will follow the research strategy in Fig. 3. First, there are five raw AE signals are collect directly from the AE sensor during turning process. Then, for each signal, type-1 fuzzy modelling work as a filter. After, the filtered data are used for type-2 fuzzy modelling. Type-2 TSK fuzzy approach is not only model the high complex non-linear physical machining processes, but also estimate the ambiguities and uncertainties associated with AE. Its interval set of output assesses the information of uncertainty in AE. Finally, the type-2 fuzzy uncertainty interval information are collect for tool wear assessment, which is of great value to investigate the complicated tool wear condition during machining process.The experiment of this paper was taken on the machine BOEHRINGER CNC Lathe. The workpiece material is Titanium Metal matrix Composite (Ti MMC) 10wt% TiC/Ti-6Al-4V. This kind of material is widely used in aerospace and military applications for its high hardness, light weight, high bending strength, fracture toughness, higher modulus, and elevated temperature resistance and high wear resistance. Consequently, its machining is very difficult.The cutting tool insert was carbide from SECO tools (CNMG 120408 MF1 CP200). Turning test was done on a cylinder of Ti MMC 2.5″ diameter in dry machining conditions. The machining speed (80m/min) was chosen to exceed the manufacturer's recommendation in order to see and check the tool cutting speed limits. The cutting depth was kept at 0.15mm and the cutting feed was 0.1mm.During the test, every time when cutting length reached 10mm, the machine was stopped to manually measure the tool wear parameter (VBB). In the experiment, There are five AE signal sets was recorded according different cutting section: 0–10mm, 10–20mm, 20–30mm, 30–40mm and 40–50mm. Fig. 4shows recorded raw AE signalAErawdirectly from the AE sensor.From Fig. 4(a), For example, it is observed that the cutting tool is approaching the workpiece and gradually reaching the cutting depth during the first 5–8s. After 30s, the cutting tool leaves the surface of workpiece. The middle period is the steady cutting period, which contents the main useful information for tool wear condition investigation. This paper focus on filtering and capturing the uncertainty on AE signals during the five continuous cutting periods shown in Fig. 5.Type-1 TSK fuzzy modelling was used to eliminate noise components in the AE signal as the first step of the data processing procedure. Demirli's extended subtractive clustering identification algorithm [40] was used to estimate both the number and initial location of cluster centres and extract the TSK fuzzy rules from input/output data. The clustering parameters are pre-initialized. The cluster radius is confined to the range [0.15; 1.0] with a step size of 0.15. The accept ratio and the reject ratio are both considered in the range [0; 1.0] with a step size of 0.1. The squash factor is considered in the range [0.05; 2] with a step size of 0.05. Combined with a least-square estimation algorithm, the fuzzy systems for each cutting length were identified. The information about clustering parameters, number of rules identified standard deviation and cluster centres for fuzzy Gaussian membership function in Fig. 6can be found in Table 1. The identified results are in Fig. 7.One of example of fuzzy rules is given as following:IFT=exp−12t−12.29901.12,THEN AE=5.4400e+4×t−4.9517e+5The second step of data processing procedure in this experiment consists of expanding the type-1 fuzzy system to a type-2 system. Because the AE signals used are relatively uncontaminated, uncertainty in the AE signal is much smaller than the raw AE signal value. The spreading percentage for clustersajkis confined to the range [0; 0.01%] with a step size of 0.0001%. The spreading percentage for the consequent parametersbjkis considered as 0.02%. One of the type-2 fuzzy rules related to its type-1 fuzzy rule in section 3.3.1 is given as following:IFT=exp−12t−12.2990×(1±0.003%1.12,THEN AE=5.4400e+4×(1±0.02%)×t−4.9517e+5×(1±0.02%)The information on uncertainty in the five AE signal sets is illustrated in Fig. 8between the type-2 fuzzy output upper boundaryAE¯(dotted curve) and the lower boundaryAE_(dashed curve). The overall identified AE signal value AEfuzzyis shown as solid curve.It is clear that, comparing Figs. 7 and 8, type-2 fuzzy approach has an outstanding advantage that it is the only artificial intelligent method which can capture the uncertainty during the machining process and estimate the variation of approximation of AE signal.As indicated in Fig. 8, there is the uncertainty interval for each cutting section. The most significant during the cutting period (40–50mm) is shown in Fig. 8(e). Table 2summarizes the value of maximum and minimum variations betweenAE¯and AEfuzzy,AE_and AEfuzzy,AE¯andAE_, also AEfuzzyand the raw AE signal valueAEraw, where, representatively,(13)V1=|AE¯−AEfuzzy|(14)V2=|AE_−AEfuzzy|(15)V3=|AE¯−AE_|and(16)V4=|AEraw−AEfuzzy|The greatest variation of each cutting instant is V3 between the upper boundary and lower boundary of type-2 interval output. The biggest value is 24.7279mv in the final cutting section, as same as that in Fig. 8(e). The last colon in Table 2 lists VBBmeasured in the end of each cutting section. Fig. 9indicted the uncertainty interval for each cutting period.Figs. 10 and 11indicate the relation between the variation (uncertainty) of AE signal and tool wear measured. It is clear that the development trend of maximum and minimum variations is same as that of tool wear. Both maximum change of tool wear condition and AE signal occurred during the period that the cutting length was changed from 40 to 50mm. It is observed that during initial cutting period (cutting length from 0 to 40mm), AE signal varies in accordance with the initial stages of wear occurring. And the period with significant variations (cutting section 40–50mm) corresponds to the period of relatively rapid wear or failure of cutting tool. Along with the increasing of uncertainty in AE signal, the development of wear is continuous and monotonically increasing. This proves that AE signal is associated with cutting tool wear, even catastrophic tool failure.
