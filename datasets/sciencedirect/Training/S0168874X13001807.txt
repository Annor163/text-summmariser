@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an advanced analysis method for three-dimensional semi-rigid steel frames accounting for three main nonlinear sources. The second-order effects are considered by the use of stability functions obtained from the solution of beam–columns under axial force and bending moments at two ends. The spread of plasticity over the cross section and along the member length is captured by monitoring the uniaxial stress–strain relation of each fiber on selected sections. The nonlinear semi-rigid beam-to-column connection is simulated by a 3D multi-spring element. The generalized displacement control method is applied to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations in an incremental-iterative scheme. The nonlinear load–displacement responses and ultimate load results compare well with those of previous studies. It is concluded that using only one element per member with monitoring the end sections accurately likely predict the nonlinear responses of three-dimensional semi-rigid steel frames.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There are two common finite element approaches for advanced analysis of three-dimensional (3D) steel framed structures: the plastic zone methods (spread-of-plasticity) [1–5] and the plastic hinge methods (concentrated plasticity) [6–13]. The former methods based on geometric stiffness matrices requires member to be discretized into several elements to accurately predict the second-order effects and inelastic behavior of steel structures. It is generally recognized to be computationally expensive (computer resources, computational time) because numerous discretizations of elements are used in analysis modeling. Clarke [1], and Teh [5] presented finite element formulations using Hermitian cubic polynomial functions for plastic-zone analysis of 3D framed structures. Foley and Vinnakota [3,4] developed a nonlinear finite element program for second-order spread-of-yielding analysis of 2D multi-storey semi-rigid steel frames under static loading. In order to save computer resources and analysis time, Foley [2] proposed a parallel processing and vectorization for advanced analysis of multi-storey steel frames on a multi-core computer. Structures are divided into some sub-structures for reducing the unknown of nonlinear equilibrium equations. The plastic hinge methods [6,8–12,14,15] based on stability functions obtained from the closed-form solution of the beam–columns under end forces can capture the second-order effects using only one or two elements per member. The inelastic behavior of material is usually considered by the lumped hinges at the two ends of the members. The effects of spread of plasticity and residual stress are considered by using the reduced tangent modulus approach [6,8–10,14]. This method is called the “practical advanced analysis method” because it can consider all key factors, influencing the ultimate strength of the steel framed structures in an effective way, and is then suitable for adoption in office design [6–11,13–15]. However, the plastic hinge analysis is limited due to its incapability of capturing the more complex member behaviors that involve torsional–flexural buckling, local buckling, and severe yielding under the combined action of compression and bi-axial bending, which may significantly reduce the load-carrying capacity of the structure [16]. Furthermore, the hinge methods have shown to over-estimate the limit strength when structural behavior is dominated by the instability of a few members [14]. Also, it may inadequately give information as to what is happening inside the member because the member is assumed to remain fully elastic between its ends.In recent years, Ziemian and McGuire [13] proposed a modified tangent modulus approach for the second-order inelastic hinge method that can produce the accuracy of more sophisticated plastic zone methods in analyzing the in-plane behavior of compact doubly symmetric sections. Researchers recommended that further systematic research be undertaken for the purpose of establishing the terms, constants, and limits of applicability for additional groupings of sections, imperfections, and residual stresses. Ngo-Huu and Kim [12] improved the common plastic hinge method to become the fiber-hinge method for considering the initial residual stress directly. However, the length of fiber hinges was not adequately investigated and it also cannot capture the effects of distributed plasticity along the member, so it is difficult to apply it towards practical designs. Chiorean [17] proposed a beam–column method for nonlinear inelastic analysis of 3D semi-rigid steel frames. The nonlinear inelastic force–strain relationship and stability functions are used in representing the inelastic behavior and second-order effects, respectively. The advantage of this study is that it is able to trace the spread of plasticity along the member length by using only one beam–column element per framed member in analysis modeling. However, it seems that the shape parameters a and n of the Ramberg–Osgood model and α and p of the proposed modified Albermani model for the force–strain relationship of the cross-section, which considerably affect the inelastic behavior of the steel frames, are not consistently used. Recently, Thai and Kim [18] presented a fiber beam–column element which considers both geometric and material nonlinearities. The material nonlinearities are included by tracing the uniaxial stress–strain relationship of each fiber on the cross sections. However, updating of the elemental tangent stiffness matrix based on the tangent modulus of each fiber calculated from the ratio of the incremental fiber stress and incremental fiber strain is not rational for the elastic-perfectly plastic material model of steel. This is not rational because with the elastic-perfectly plastic material, the tangent modulus of steel fibers are only equal to the initial Young's modulus, or zero as yielded fibers. To overcome the limitations of the above mentioned studies, this study will develop a fiber beam–column element for advanced analysis of 3D steel frames with nonlinear semi-rigid connections.A different important nonlinear source in advanced analysis of steel frames is beam-to-column connections. In reality, beam-to-column connections are not fully rigid or ideally pinned joints, they play a role in transfering a part of the forces from some elements to other ones, and the rest is absorbed by connections. The real behavior of connections is nonlinear and usually presented by the moment–rotation relationship of rotational springs with zero-lengths. In the above-mentioned studies, the connections are usually modeled as rotational springs attached at the member ends, then, the elemental tangent stiffness matrix will be modified for considering the effects of connection flexibility [3,4,8,9,17,19].In this paper, a fiber beam–column method is developed for the second-order inelastic analysis of 3D semi-rigid steel frames. The spread of plasticity over the cross section and along the member length is captured by tracing the uniaxial stress–strain relations of each fiber on the cross sections located at the selected integration points along the member length. The Gauss–Lobatto integration rule is adopted herein for numerically evaluating the elemental stiffness matrix instead of the classical Gauss integration rule because it always includes the end sections of the integration field. Stability functions obtained from the closed-form solution of a beam–column subjected to end forces are used to accurately capture the small P-delta effect. A new force interpolation function matrix is developed to consider the effects of moment magnification due to axial force and lateral displacements. Warping torsion and lateral-torsional buckling are not considered in this study. An independent two-node zero-length connection element with six translational and rotational springs is developed for nonlinear beam-to-column joints and various connections. This is efficient because modification of the beam–column stiffness matrix considering the semi-rigid connections is unnecessary and the connection is ready to integrate with any element types (e.g. truss joints, bridge joints, etc.). The Kishi–Chen three-parameter power model [20] and the Chen–Lui exponential model [21] are applied for representing the moment–rotation relationship and predicting the instantaneous stiffness of connections. The generalized displacement control (GDC) method proposed by Yang and Shieh [22] is employed for solving nonlinear equilibrium equations. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the proposed proceduce in predicting the second-order inelastic response of 3D steel frames with semi-rigid connections.To capture the effect of axial force acting through the lateral displacement of the beam–column element (small P-delta effect), the stability functions reported by Chen and Lui [23] are used to minimize modeling and solution time. Generally only one element per member is needed to accurately capture the small P-delta effect. From Kim and Choi [9], the incremental force–displacement equation of 3D beam–column element that accounts for transverse shear deformation effects can be expressed as(1){ΔPΔMyAΔMyBΔMzAΔMzBΔT}=[EAL000000C1yC2y0000C2yC1y000000C1zC2z0000C2zC1z000000GJL]{ΔδΔθyAΔθyBΔθzAΔθzBΔϕ}where ΔP, ΔMyA, ΔMyB, ΔMzA, ΔMzB, and ΔT are the incremental axial force, end moments with respect to y and z axes, and torsion respectively; Δδ, ΔθyA, ΔθyB, ΔθzA, ΔθzB, and Δϕ are the incremental axial displacement, joint rotations, and angle of twist; C1y, C2y, C1z, and C2zare bending stiffness coefficients accounting for the transverse shear deformation effects, and are defined as(2a)C1y=k1y2−k2y2+k1yAszGL2k1y+2k2y+AszGL(2b)C2y=−k1y2+k2y2+k2yAszGL2k1y+2k2y+AszGL(2c)C1z=k1z2−k2z2+k1zAsyGL2k1z+2k2z+AsyGL(2d)C2z=−k1z2+k2z2+k2yAsyGL2k1z+2k2z+AsyGLwhere k1n=S1n(EIn/L) and k2n=S2n(EIn/L); S1nand S2nare stability functions with respect to n axis (n=y, z), and are expressed as(3a)S1n={knLsin(knL)−(knL)2cos(knL)2−2cos(knL)−knLsin(knL)ifP<0(knL)2cosh(knL)−knLsinh(knL)2−2cosh(knL)+knLsinh(knL)ifP>0(3b)S2n={(knL)2−knLsin(knL)2−2cos(knL)−knLsin(knL)ifP<0knLsin(knL)−(knL)22−2cosh(knL)+knLsinh(knL)ifP>0wherekn2=|P|/EIn. EA, EIn, and GJ denote the axial, bending and torsional stiffness of the beam–column element, and are integrated as follows:(4)EA=∑j=1swj(∑i=1mEiAi)j(5)EIy=∑j=1swj[∑i=1m(EiAizi2+Iyi)]j(6)EIz=∑j=1swj[∑i=1m(EiAiyi2+Izi)]j(7)GJ=∑j=1sGwj[∑i=1m(Aizi2+Aiyi2+Ji)]jin which s is the total number of monitored sections along an element; m is the total number of fibers divided on the monitored cross-section; wjis the weight coefficient for Lobatto quadrature at the jth section (Michels [24]); Eiand Aiare the elastic modulus of the material and the area of ith fiber, respectively; Iyiand Iziare the y-axis and z-axis moment of inertia of ith fiber around its centroid; Jiis the St. Venant torsional constant for cross-section of ith fiber; yiand ziare the coordinates of ith fiber to the centroidal bending axis as shown inFig. 1. The element force–deformation relationship of Eq. (1) is can be expressed in symbolic form as(8){ΔF}=[Ke]{Δd}where(9){ΔF}=[ΔPΔMyAΔMyBΔMzAΔMzBΔT]T(10){Δd}=[ΔδΔθyAΔθyBΔθzAΔθzBΔϕ]TThe element stiffness matrix is evaluated numerically by the Gauss–Lobatto integration rules [24] because this method allows for two integration points to coincide with the end sections of the elements. Since inelastic behavior in beam elements often concentrates at the end of member, the monitoring of the end sections of the element is advantageous from the standpoint of accuracy and numerical stability. By contrast, the outermost integration points of other integration methods (e.g., the classical Gauss method, the Legendre–Gauss method, and the Newton–Cotes method, etc.) only approach the end sections with increasing order of integration, but never coincide with the end sections and, hence, result in overestimation of the member strength [25].In order to capture the spread of plasticity throughout the member's length, a fiber beam–column model as shown in Fig. 1 is used. The fiber beam–column element is divided into a discrete number of monitored sections represented by the integration points. Each monitored section is divided into m small fibers and each fiber is represented by its geometric characteristic, area Ai, and its coordinate location corresponding to its centroid (yi, zi). For hot-rolled steel sections, the residual stresses are assigned directly to fibers as the initial stresses.Fig. 2 illustrates the ECCS residual stress pattern of the I-shape section used for this research [26]. Section deformations are represented by three strain resultants: the axial strain ε and curvatures χzand χywith respect to z and y axes, respectively. The corresponding force resultants are the axial force N and bending moments Mzand My. The section forces and deformations are grouped in the following vectors:(11)Sectionforcevector{Q}=[NMyMz]T(12)Sectiondeformationvector{q}=[εχyχz]TThe incremental section force vector at each integration point is determined based on the incremental element force vector {ΔF} and the force interpolation function matrix [B(x)] as(13){ΔQ}=[B(x)]{ΔF}(14)[B(x)]=[100000δz(x)(x/L−1)x/L000−δy(x)00(x/L−1)x/L0]where δy(x) and δz(x) are the lateral displacements for the local y and z axes, respectively. Since the curvatures can be approximated by the second derivative of the lateral displacements, δy(x) and δz(x) are obtained from solving the differential equations given by (Chen and Lui [23])(15)δy(x)=MzAEIzkz2[cos(kzx)−1+xL−sin(kzx)tan(kzL)]+MzBEIzkz2[xL−sin(kzx)sin(kzL)](16)δz(x)=MyAEIyky2[cos(kyx)−1+xL−sin(kyx)tan(kyL)]+MyBEIyky2[xL−sin(kyx)sin(kyL)]The incremental section deformation vector is determined based on the incremental section force vector and the section flexibility matrix as(17){Δq}=[ksec]−1{ΔQ}where[ksec]is the section stiffness matrix given as(18)[ksec]=[∑i=1mEiAi∑i=1mEiAizi−∑i=1mEiAiyi∑i=1mEiAizi∑i=1mEi(Aizi2+Iyi)−∑i=1mEiAiyizi−∑i=1mEiAiyi−∑i=1mEiAiyizi∑i=1mEi(Aiyi2+Izi)]Applying the assumption that plane sections remain plane and normal to the reference axis of the member (with the exception of warping deformations due to non-uniform torsion), the incremental longitudinal fiber strain vector is calculated from the incremental section deformation vector as(19){Δe}=[l]{Δq}where [l] is the linear geometric matrix given as follows:(20)[l]=[1z1−y11z2−y2.........1zm−ym]Once the incremental fiber strain is evaluated, the incremental fiber stress is computed based on an appropriate stress–strain constitutive law for material. In this study, the elastic-perfectly plastic material model is applied for steel (neglecting strain hardening). The elastic modulus of each fiber Eiwill either be equal to the initial elastic modulus or be equal to zero for yielded fibers. By updating during the iteration process, axial and flexural stiffness of each cross section (Eq. (18)) obtained in this way are then integrated along the member length by Eqs. (4–7) to form the element tangent stiffness accounting for spread of plasticity.The section resisting forces are computed by integrating the axial force and biaxial bending moment contributions of all fibers as(21){QR}={NMyMz}={∑i=1mσiAi∑i=1mσiAizi−∑i=1mσiAiyi}where σiis the normal stress of ith fiber accumulated from the incremental fiber stress itself. If the fiber is yielding, its normal stress will be assigned equal to the yield stress of steel σi=σy.The large P-delta effect is the influence of axial force P acting through the relative transverse displacement of the member ends. This effect can be considered by using the geometric stiffness matrix [Kg] as(22)[Kg]12×12=[[Ks]−[Ks]−[Ks]T[Ks]]where(23)[Ks]=[0a−b000ac0000−b0c000000000000000000000]and(24)a=MzA+MzBL2,b=MyA+MyBL2,c=PLThe displacement of a beam–column element can be decomposed into two parts: the element deformation and rigid displacement. The incremental element deformation {Δd} in Eq. (10) can be obtained from the incremental element displacement {ΔD} as(25){Δd}=[T]6×12{ΔD}where(26)[T]6×12=[−10000010000000−1/L010001/L00000−1/L000001/L01001/L00010−1/L000001/L00000−1/L0001000100000−100]The tangent stiffness matrix of a nonlinear beam–column element is obtained as follows:(27)[K]12×12=[T]6×12T[Ke]6×6[T]6×12+[Kg]12×12An independent zero-length element with three translational and three rotational springs is developed to simulate the connection of two different elements. This multi-spring element can be used to connect two nodes with the same coordinate (i≡j) as illustrated inFig. 3. Since the purpose of this study is mainly to verify the bending moment transference in the major and minor axis of the beam–column element, the translational and torsional deformation components of the connection are prevented by modeling absolutely rigid springs in all numerical examples. The coupling effects between the six springs in a connection are also neglected.The relation between the incremental force vector {ΔFs} and incremental deformation vector {Δus} of the multi-spring connection element is given by(28){ΔFs}=[Kes]{Δus}(29)[Kes]=[Rxδ000000Ryδ000000Rzδ000000Ryθ000000Rzθ000000Rxθ](30){ΔFs}=[ΔPxΔPyΔPzΔMyΔMzΔMx]T(31){Δus}=[ΔδxΔδyΔδzΔθyΔθzΔθx]Twhere [Kes] is the diagonal stiffness matrix for each connection element,RnδandRnθare the component stiffness for the translational and rotational springs with respect to the n axis (n=x, y, z); ΔPn, ΔMn, Δδn, and Δθnare the incremental spring forces, moments, axial deformations, and bending deformations of the connection element with respect to the n axis (n=x, y, z), respectively. The instantaneous tangent stiffness of the major and minor-axis rotational springs (RzθandRyθ) is given by(32)Rnθ=dMd|θr|where moment M is a nonlinear function following the relative rotation θrat the connection represented by the Kishi–Chen three-parameter power model [20] and the Chen–Lui exponential model [21].The Kishi–Chen model [20] is currently one of the most popular models used for semi-rigid connections since it needs only three parameters to capture the moment–rotation curve and always yields a positive stiffness. The moment–rotation relationship of the connection is presented by Chen and Kishi as follows:(33)M=Rki|θr|[1+(|θr|/θ0)n]1/nwhere M and θrare the moment and the rotation of the connection, n is the shape parameter, θ0 is the reference plastic rotation, and Rkiis the initial connection stiffness.Lui and Chen [21] proposed an exponential model as follows:(34)M=M0+∑j=1nCj(1−exp−|θr|2jα)+Rkf|θr|in which M and |θr| are the moment and the absolute value of the rotational deformation of the connection, α is the scaling factor, Rkfis the strain-hardening stiffness of the connection, M0 is the initial moment, Cjis the curve-fitting coefficient, and n is the number of terms considered.The incremental connection element deformation {Δus} in Eq. (31) can be obtained from the incremental connection element displacement {ΔUs} as(35){Δus}=[Ts]6×12{ΔUs}where(36)[Ts]6×12=[−1000001000000−1000001000000−10000010000000−1000001000000−1000001000−100000100]The tangent stiffness matrix of a nonlinear connection element used for assembling global structure stiffness matrix is obtained as follows:(37)[KS]12×12=[Ts]6×12T[Kes]6×6[Ts]6×12This section presents a numerical method for solving the static nonlinear equations of 3D framed structures. Among several numerical methods, the generalized displacement control (GDC) method proposed by Yang and Shieh [22] appears to be one of the most robust and effective methods for solving the static nonlinear problems with multiple critical points because of its general numerical stability and efficiency. The incremental form of equilibrium equation can be rewritten for the jth iteration of the ith incremental step as(38)[Kj−1i]{ΔDji}=λji{P^}+{Rj−1i}where[Kj−1i]is the tangent stiffness matrix of a structure,{ΔDji}is the incremental displacement vector,{P^}is the reference load vector,{Rj−1i}is the unbalanced force vector, andλjiis the incremental load parameter.Eq. (38) can be decomposed into the following equations:(39)[Kj−1i]{ΔD^ji}={P^}(40)[Kj−1i]{ΔD¯ji}={Rj−1i}(41){ΔDji}=λji{ΔD^ji}+{ΔD¯ji}The incremental load parameterλjiis an unknown. It is determined from a constraint condition. For the first iterative step (j=1), the incremental load parameterλjiis determined based on the generalized stiffness parameter (GSP) as(42)λ1i=λ11|GSP|whereλ11is an initial value of incremental load parameter, and the GSP is defined as(43)GSP={ΔD^11}T{ΔD^11}{ΔD^1i−1}T{ΔD^1i}For the following iteration (j≥2), the incremental load parameterλjiis given by(44)λji=−{ΔD^1i−1}T{ΔD¯ji}{ΔD^1i−1}T{ΔD^ji}where{ΔD^1i−1}is the incremental displacement generated by the reference load{P^}at the first iteration of the previous incremental step (i−1), and{ΔD^ji}and{ΔD¯ji}denote the incremental displacements generated by the reference load and unbalanced force vectors, respectively, at the jth iteration of the ith incremental step, as defined in Eqs. (39) and (40).The following is a step-by-step summary of solution algorithm focused on the element state determination process of a single iteration.1.Solve the global structure equilibrium equation and update the incremental beam–column element and connection element displacements, {ΔD} and {ΔUs}, respectively.Compute the incremental element deformation, {Δd} and {Δds}, using Eqs. (25) and (35).Compute the incremental element force, {ΔF} and {ΔFs}, using Eqs. (8) and (28) based on the element stiffness matrix, [Ke]6×6 and [Kes]6×6 of the previous step, respectively.Compute the incremental section force {ΔQ} using Eq. (13).Compute the section stiffness{ksec}using Eq. (18).Compute the incremental section deformation {Δq} using Eq. (17).Compute the incremental fiber strain {Δe} using Eq. (19) and update fiber strain {e}.Compute the incremental fiber stress {Δσ} using {Δσ}=Ei{Δe} and update fiber stress {σ}. If σiσyassign σi=σyfor the elastic-perfectly plastic material model of steel.If any fiber is in yielding state σi=σyassign the fiber elastic modulus to be equal to zero, Ei=0.Compute the section resisting force {QR} using Eq. (21).Update the beam–column and connection element stiffness, [Ke]6×6 and [Kes]6×6. Update the beam–column and connection element tangent stiffness, [K]12×12 and [KS]12×12.Assemble the structure resisting force and structure stiffness matrix.Compute structure unbalanced forces.Check for the structure convergence: If the structure unbalanced forces satisfy the specified tolerance (i.e., convergence is achieved), go to the next incremental load step. Otherwise, return to step 1 for the next iteration to eliminate the structure unbalanced forces.Vogel [27] presented the portal rigid frame as the European calibration frame for second-order inelastic analysis using the plastic zone method. The initial out-of-plumb straightness of ψ=1/400 and the initial ESSC residual stress were assumed for the frame and its members (Fig. 4). Young's modulus and the yield stress of steel are E=20500N/mm2 and σy=235N/mm2. For plastic zone analysis, Vogel used 15 elements for the columns and 14 elements for the beam, while the proposed program used only two integration points along the member length corresponding to two end sections. The cross section is discretized into 66 fibers (24 at both flanges, 18 at the web). The main aim of this analysis is to demonstrate the capability of the proposed beam–column element in capturing the effects of both geometric and material nonlinearities accurately. The analysis results of the frame obtained by using the proposed beam–column element are compared with those predicted by Vogel as illustrated inFig. 5. It can be seen that the load–displacement curves without shear deformation of Vogel and the proposed program are identical.The rigid beam-to-column connections were replaced by semi-rigid ones to study the second-order inelastic behavior including the connection nonlinearity by Chen and Kim [6] using the plastic-hinge method. The three parameters for the Kishi–Chen power model of these semi-rigid connections are: Rki=31,635kNm/rad, Mu=142kNm, and n=0.98. The results of the proposed program and NASF's one in predicting the second-order inelastic response of the semi-rigid frame are shown inFig. 6, in which NASF is a nonlinear finite element program for second-order spread-of-plasticity analysis of semi-rigid planar steel frames [28]. It can be seen that the nonlinear load–displacement curves agree well. The ultimate load factor obtained from the proposed analysis is 0.940 greater than 1.73% of 0.924 produced by NASF [28].Table 1 summarizes the comparison of the ultimate load factor of the frame with the rigid and semi-rigid connections using the proposed program and those results of previous studies. Less than 2% error was achieved.Using the same personal computer configuration (AMD Phenom II X4 955 Processor, 3.2GHz; 4.00GB RAM), the analysis time of the proposed program and NASF for the second-order inelastic behavior of the semi-rigid frame are 37s and 114s, respectively. The analysis time of NASF is 3.08 times longer than the proposed program. This result demonstrates the higher computational efficiency of the proposed program.A one-bay, two-storey semi-rigid steel frame was tested by Stelmack [29] shown inFig. 7, and it is selected to verify the present study with experimental test results. The A36 W5×16 hot-rolled steel was used for all frame members. The three parameters of the Kishi–Chen power model are used to determine a curve-fitting as follows: Rki=4,463kNm/rad, Mu=26kNm, and n=0.87. The moment–rotation relationship of the connections by the experiment and curve-fitting data are in agreement as shown inFig. 8. Gravity loads were first applied at the third points of the beam of the first floor, and then a lateral load was applied as the second loading sequence. All members are discretized into 66 fibers (24 at both flanges, 18 at the web) on the cross section and two integration points at their two ends. The lateral load–displacement curves obtained by the proposed program and experimental work compare well inFig. 9. As a result, the proposed analysis is adequate in predicting the behavior and strength of semi-rigid connections.This steel frame was also solved by Vogel [27] as the European calibration frame for considering both the effects of nonlinear geometry and spread of plasticity. The configuration of the frame is illustrated inFig. 10. The geometric imperfections are simulated by the initial out-of-plumb straightness of ψ=1/450 for all column members and the initial ECCS residual stress. Young's modulus and the yield stress of steel are E=20500N/mm2 and σy=235N/mm2. In this analysis, the proposed program uses five elements per beam member, one element per column member, and five integration points per element. The cross sections of all members are discretized into 66 fibers (24 at both flanges, 18 at the web). For the frame with rigid connections, the results of the load–displacement curve and the ultimate load factor are compared inFig. 11 andTable 2, respectively. Less than 2% error was achieved. The proposed fiber beam–column element result of 1.100 is slightly lower than the ultimate limit load of 1.110 by Vogel's plastic zone method. It can be concluded that the proposed program accurately predicts the nonlinear behavior and strength of steel frames considering both the geometric and material nonlinearities.Chui and Chan [19] built in the semi-rigid joints at beam ends to study a more realistic nonlinear behavior of the frame, as shown in Fig. 10. The curve fitted parameters of the Chen–Lui exponential model for both flush end plate and single web angle connections were listed inTable 3.Fig. 12 shows the nonlinear moment–rotation relationship of these connections. The results of the proposed analysis are similar with those of Chan and Chui, as illustrated inFig. 13. It can be seen that the proposed analysis predicts the load–displacement curves are slightly lower than those of Chan and Chui by the refined plastic hinge method. This difference is due to the fact that Chan and Chui's method employed approximate shape functions accounting for the effects of geometric nonlinearity, while the proposed method uses the stability functions for capturing the second-order effects accurately. Moreover, the proposed analysis can monitor spread of plasticity along the members through selected integration points and the initial residual stress distribution is adequately considered.A six-storey space rigid frame was firstly analyzed by Orbison et al. [30] using a plastic hinge approach. Recently, Chiorean [17] used a beam–column method considering the spread of plasticity along the member length and the effects of connection flexibility. The geometric properties are described inFig. 14. A36 steel with the yield stress of 250MPa, Young's modulus of 206,850MPa, and a shear modulus of 79,293MPa are used for all members. The bolted top and seat angle connections were assumed for all beam-to-column connections of the frame and their parameters using Kishi–Chen power model are listed inTable 4[17]. Both the weak-axis and strong-axis beam-to-column connections are considered in this study. A uniform floor load of 9.6kN/m2 is converted into equivalent concentrated loads on the top of the columns. Wind loads are simulated by point loads of 53.376kN in the Y-direction at every beam–column joints. One proposed beam–column element with two integration points per member are used to model this structure. The cross sections of all members are discretized into 66 fibers (24 at both flanges, 18 at the web). As shown inFig. 15, the load–displacement curve at roof node A predicted by the proposed program compare well with Chiorean's result.To consider initial member out-of-straightness by using only one element per member, further-reduced tangent modulus method presented by Kim and Chen [10], Chen and Kim [6] can be employed. In the proposed program, Young's modulus of 0.85×E is directly assigned for all steel members to consider initial member out-of-straightness.Fig. 16 shows the load–displacement curves of the semi-rigid frame with and without geometry imperfection. The ultimate load factors of the frame with and without initial member out-of-straightness are 0.872 and 0.892, respectively. The ultimate load of the frame reduces approximate to 2.2% as considering initial member out-of-straightness. It can be concluded that the proposed program is reliable in predicting the nonlinear inelastic behavior of 3D semi-rigid steel frames.
