@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative organism of tuberculosis. Extensively drug resistant strains and latency have posed formidable challenges in the treatment of tuberculosis. The current study addresses an alpha/beta hydrolase fold bearing enzyme, epoxide hydrolase Rv1938 from Mtb. Epoxide hydrolases are involved in detoxification processes, catabolism and regulation of signaling molecules. Using GROMACS, a 100ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for Rv1938. Cavities were identified within the protein at various time frames of the simulation and their volumes were computed. During MD simulation, in addition to the substrate binding cavity, opening of two new cavities located behind the active site was observed. These cavities may be similar to the backdoor proposed for acetylcholinesterase. Structural superimposition of epoxide hydrolase from Mtb with the epoxide hydrolase of Agrobacterium radiobacter1 AD1 (Ephy) indicates that cavity1 in Mtb lies at an identical position to that of the water tunnel in Ephy. Further, docking of the substrate and an inhibitor with protein structures obtained from MD simulation at various time frames was also performed. The potential role of these cavities is discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major disease infecting one-third of the world population. According to WHO reports, about 8.6 million people were affected with TB in 2012 and 1.3 million succumbed to the disease (WHO, 2013). Emergence of multi drug resistant strains and dormancy of Mtb have posed serious challenges in the treatment of tuberculosis. Another issue is the synergy between TB and HIV that has necessitated new therapies against these infections.Mtb primarily infects the lungs and interacts with the dendritic cells, pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. However, they are found mainly in the macrophages during infection (Gupta et al., 2012). Granuloma that develops at the site of infection is surrounded by lymphocytes and is loaded with foamy macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytes (Russell et al., 2010). For its survival, Mtb forms lipid bodies using host lipid as its energy source (Peyron et al., 2008). Latent TB is hard to diagnose and also serves as a reservoir for the transmission of the infection. The bacteria reside within the host for decades in a dormant state and reactivate when the host immunity declines. Hence, it is necessary to identify drugs that act against these non-replicative dormant bacteria.Analysis of the complete genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Cole et al., 1998) has revealed the presence of six epoxide hydrolases (Rv3617, Rv1938, Rv1124, Rv2214c, Rv3670 and Rv0134). Further sequence analysis suggested that the Mtb genome encodes around 30 possible epoxide hydrolases including these six (Biswal et al., 2008). Epoxide hydrolases (EH) catalyze the conversion of epoxides into corresponding diols. Epoxides are toxic and highly reactive compounds which are also harmful to the pathogen. Multiple copies of EH in Mtb and toxicity of epoxide compounds suggest that inhibiting the EH enzyme could lead to anti-tubercular therapy (Johansson et al., 2005).Further, two loci mel1 and mel2 in Mycobacterium marinum that confer enhanced host cell infection were identified. Mtb has six genes (Rv1936, Rv1937, Rv1938, Rv1939, Rv1940 and Rv1941) that are homologous to mel2 locus of M. marinum. Mutant M. marinum with mutations at mel1 and mel2 were unable to infect the murine and fish macrophage cell lines. Rv1938, epoxide hydrolase B (EHB) shares 82% sequence identity with melH gene of the mel2 locus of M. marinum (El-etr et al., 2004) .Rv1938 belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold. EHB is a 356 residue enzyme with a catalytic alpha/beta hydrolase domain (residues 1–129, residues 276–356) and a cap domain (residues 130–275). Asp104, Asp302 and His333 constitute the active-site pocket and residues Tyr164, Tyr272, Phe36 and Trp105 form the oxyanion hole. A comparison between EHB of Mtb and human EH shows differences in certain structural elements. These include residues 132–149 (part of the loop that connects the hydrolase and cap domain), residues 190–206 and 214–226 of the cap domain and residues 303–315 of the hydrolase domain which form a substrate binding cavity. Regions formed by residues 150–163, 227–250 of the cap domain and residues 20–29 of the hydrolase domain are longer in Mtb EHB when compared to human EH (Biswal et al., 2008).Considering the critical role of epoxide hydrolase for the survival of bacillus, it is an important drug target for tuberculosis treatment. The dynamics of epoxide hydrolase, Rv1938 from Mtb is elucidated with an objective to gain insights into the domain movements and the conformational changes that occur in this enzyme. Further, the protein structures obtained at different time frames were docked with the substrate and inhibitor to highlight the essential structural features for ligand binding. MD simulations have been used in the past to understand the activity and behavior of biomolecules (Adcock and McCammon, 2006).The crystal structure coordinates of EHB from Mtb bearing PDB ID: 2E3J was obtained from Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). In the 3D structure of EHB, residues 1–3 and 207–213 were missing. Residues 207–213 were modelled using Modloop server (Fiser and Sali, 2003). This structure was used as the starting structure for MD simulations and is shown in Fig. 1a.MD simulation was performed using GROMACS (Berendsen et al., 1995; Pronk et al., 2013). The topology was generated using pdb2gmx tool with standard pH 7 amino acid protonation state. G43a1 force field was used for the simulation. The starting structure was solvated with the extended single point charge (SPCE) water model in a cubic box with 3nm space around the solute. The net negative charge of the system was neutralized by replacing the water molecules with 17 Na+ ions. In total there were 190,763 atoms in the simulation; 187,239 atoms of these were water molecules. Energy minimization was done using steepest descents method. Following energy minimization, the system was equilibrated for 100ps under NVT (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) and NPT conditions (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) using leap-frog integrator. This was followed by an all atom molecular dynamics simulation for 100ns. The simulation was repeated for another round of 100ns with G43a1 force field and with AMBER99SB-ILDN force field to validate the consistency in the results.The system was weakly coupled to an external bath using V-rescale thermostat. The reference temperature was set as 300K and LINCS algorithm (Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992; Hess et al., 1997) was used for bond constraints. Long range electrostatic interactions were treated with particle mesh ewald (PME) (Essmann et al., 1995) and the time step used was 2fs.GROMACS built-in tools were used for the analysis of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg). Location of cavities and their volume was calculated using CASTp server (Dundas et al., 2006). Solvent Accessible Surface area (SASA) was calculated using PyMol interface (Schrödinger LLC, 2010).Essential dynamics was performed using the entire trajectory, to identify the global motions. Gromacs tools g_covar and g_anaeig were used. Analysis was done using Cα atoms. A covariance matrix was constructed and diagonalized. Eigenvectors were generated based on the covariance matrix diagonalization. Porcupine plot was generated for the first eigenvector using PyMol (Schrödinger LLC, 2010). Sausage plot was calculated using MD trajectory and the motion observed along eigenvector1 was displayed using MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996).An enzyme kinetic study by Biswal et al. (2008), identified trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide as a substrate towards which Mtb EHB Rv1938 had higher specific activity. The substrate, trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide and an inhibitor, carbanilide were used for the docking study. The SMILES representations were retrieved from PubChem compound database (Bolton et al., 2008). Using canonical SMILES, the 3D structure of the ligands were generated using Corina molecular networks (Sadowski et al., 1994). The ligands used in our study are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c. Blind docking was performed using Autodock (Morris et al., 2009) with default grid spacing of 0.375Å. Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used as the local search parameter. Docking included a flexible ligand and rigid protein molecule. Ten docking runs were carried out for each ligand. Atomic contacts between the ligand and the protein were analyzed using Accerlys Discovery Studio visualizer (San Diego: Accelrys Software Inc., 2012).The 3D structures of Mtb EHB Rv1938, obtained at each nanosecond interval from the simulation were docked separately with the substrate, trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide and the inhibitor, carbanilide. From the ten docking runs of each of these docking studies, the complex with lowest energy was used for the further analysis.Sequences of epoxide hydrolase from Mtb (A4KI82) and Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (O31243) were retrieved from UniprotKB (Consortium, 2014). Sequence alignment was performed using Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) and secondary structure annotation was prepared using ESPript (Gouet et al., 2000).
