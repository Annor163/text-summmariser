@&#ABSTRACT@&#
There is a global challenge in demand and need of electricity. Whenever a serious fault occurs, it affects the productivity of any power plant. So many indicators have been identified in real-time fault diagnosis of steam turbine which is extremely important in a functioning power plant. Detection of fault and early rectification requires a real time intelligent fault diagnostic system. This paper considers seven types of very slowly happening and accumulating physical phenomena which will ultimately lead to deterioration in turbine performance. Based on the acquired domain knowledge, an online intelligent diagnostic analyzer for turbine performance degradation is designed in this paper by using a VLSI based methodology written in Verilog code and simulated using a simulator (Modelsim Altera 6.4a). This system can be easily implemented on to FPGA which enables the identification of the root causes for turbine performance degradation. The simulation results show that the developed real-time fault diagnostic system is accurate, high percentile with less time consuming, cost effective, and easy to apply and user friendly.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A steam turbine converts thermal energy possessed by steam into mechanical energy which in turn is used to generate electrical power. Steam turbines are very expensive and consisting of complex structural equipment requiring high quality materials with precision manufacturing methods. Any foreign deposits in any expansion stage of turbine due to poor water and steam chemistry management can cause severe financial losses due to performance degradation of turbine. These deposits are capable of changing steam velocities as well as pressure drops in contrast to original design values and ultimately resulting in reduction of efficiency and capacity. Further excessive deposits can lead to vibration problems. The reduced output costs thousands of dollars per day in lost revenue, and in some cases equipment repair can amount to a substantial sum when serious structural damage has occurred. Equipment manufacturers usually recommend different diagnostic procedures on the basis of specific periodic time schedules, which have to be carried out routinely as maintenance tasks to prevent major fault occurrences [1]. However, this includes dismantling the equipment which in turn increases the subsequent risk of other potential problems such as vibration and leakage [2,3]. This necessitates on line system performance diagnosis and identification of root causes [4] so that the operating and maintenance staff can take appropriate actions and steps.Fault detection implies the identification of change in performance of an equipment or system as per performance indicators (say efficiency and heat rate in case of turbine) while fault diagnosis refers to root-cause identification for change in performance of the equipment. An analytical system model, built based on physical principals, can effectively be used to detect poor system performance and find the root causes [5]. This is by no means an easy task for highly non-linear and dynamic systems [6], since model imprecision often leads to difficulties in making a clear distinction between deviations made by model uncertainty and those imposed by a fault affecting the system or unknown disturbances. Following a proper fault diagnosis, recovery procedures can be accommodated, resulting in fault tolerant control system [7,8]. Hence, in the absence of precise analytical model for complex processes, other diagnostic approaches must be utilized [9]. Signal processing offers a candid approach when an analytical model is not available. Signal characteristics can be investigated by either time domain methods (e.g., correlation and mean-change), frequency domain methods (e.g., spectral analysis), or with time-frequency or wavelet analysis [10]. However, the difficulty lies in relating the way a change in some quantity (e.g., the signal mean, the spectrum, etc.) is correlated with the each type of fault characteristics. Another way to deal with diagnostic objectives is by classification or pattern recognition mainly based on historical process data or expert knowledge about the system [11]. In other words, the expert's perception, knowledge and prediction on what would happen if a particular root cause occurs within the system or equipment by heuristic rules. The authors- having been motivated by the heuristic rules provided by Cotton [12] have come out with an on line diagnostic analyzer for finding the root causes for the deterioration in HP, IP and LP stage efficiency of steam turbine. The on line diagnostic tool is designed by using a VLSI based methodology written in Verilog code and simulated using a simulator (Modelsim Altera 6.4a).
