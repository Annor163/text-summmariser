@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A recent promise to access unstructured clinical data from electronic health records on large-scale has revitalized the interest in automated de-identification of clinical notes, which includes the identification of mentions of Protected Health Information (PHI). We describe the methods developed and evaluated as part of the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 challenge to identify PHI defined by 25 entity types in longitudinal clinical narratives. Our approach combines knowledge-driven (dictionaries and rules) and data-driven (machine learning) methods with a large range of features to address de-identification of specific named entities. In addition, we have devised a two-pass recognition approach that creates a patient-specific run-time dictionary from the PHI entities identified in the first step with high confidence, which is then used in the second pass to identify mentions that lack specific clues. The proposed method achieved the overall micro F1-measures of 91% on strict and 95% on token-level evaluation on the test dataset (514 narratives). Whilst most PHI entities can be reliably identified, particularly challenging were mentions of Organizations and Professions. Still, the overall results suggest that automated text mining methods can be used to reliably process clinical notes to identify personal information and thus providing a crucial step in large-scale de-identification of unstructured data for further clinical and epidemiological studies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A recent promise and the potential of wider availability of data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to support clinical research are often hindered by personal health information that is present in EHRs, raising a number of ethical and legal issues. De-identification of such data is therefore one of the main pre-requisites for using EHRs in clinical research. As a result, there is a growing interest for automated de-identification methods to ultimately aid accessibility to data by removing Protected Health Information (PHI) from clinical records. De-identification of unstructured data in particular is challenging, as PHI can appear virtually anywhere in a clinical narrative or letter. This task is often considered as Named Entity Recognition (NER), where mentions of specific PHI data types (e.g. patient names, their age and address) need to be identified in the text of clinical narratives.Automated de-identification of unstructured documents has been a research topic for more than twenty years. As early as 1996, Sweeney et al. proposed a rule-based approach to recognize twenty five overlapping entity types they identified as PHI in EHRs [1]. Since then, a large number of systems have been introduced, including knowledge-based [2–5] and data-driven [6–11], as well as hybrid [12–14] methods that combine various approaches. In terms of types of clinical narrative, previous de-identification research has explored varied clinical documents such as discharge summaries [11,15], pathology reports [9], nursing progress notes [2] and mental health records [4].The 2006 i2b2 de-identification challenge [15] was the first effort to provide a common test-bed for eight PHI entity types (mentions of Patients, Doctors, Hospitals, IDs, Dates, Locations, Phone numbers and Age) in clinical discharge summaries. The submitted systems ranged from rule-based [5] and machine-learning (ML) methods (e.g. using Conditional Random Fields [13], Hidden Markov Models [13], and Decision Trees [8]) with a wide range of features, to hybrid approaches (e.g. combining rules and Support Vector Machines [12]). A notable observation across methods was the use of knowledge-driven techniques (in particular rules) both for the direct recognition of PHI and in support of data-driven and hybrid methods. For example, rules were used as features in ML models (e.g. indicating whether a particular rule was triggered) [12], as a post-processing correction module [13] or combined with data-driven results at the final step (e.g. integration of ML and rule-based annotations) [14]. This trend was often motivated by the presence of a number of categories that are characterized by regularized expressions (e.g., date, phone, zip/postcode, and identification numbers), which make rules an efficient modeling technique. In general, the 2006 shared task showed that data-driven methods with features generated by rules for regularized expressions performed best [8,13]. They were followed by hybrid methods [12], while the pure rule-based systems proved to perform less well [5].The 2014 i2b2/UTHealth [16] Shared Task in de-identification [17] of longitudinal clinical narratives focused on 25 entity types, inclusive of twelve types as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The entity types were grouped into seven main categories: Names (e.g., patient and doctor names), Profession, Locations (e.g., street, city, zip code, organizations), Contacts (e.g., phone, fax, email), IDs (e.g., medical record, identification number), Age and Dates. The organizers provided a fully annotated mention-level training dataset, as well as a test dataset for the evaluation. This paper describes a hybrid method that integrates the results of knowledge- (dictionary- and rule-based components) and data-driven methods. We present the results and further discuss the challenges in the de-identification task.
