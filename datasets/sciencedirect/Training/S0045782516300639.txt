@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The numerical manifold method (NMM) surmounting the mesh dependence has successfully solved very complicated problems involving small deformation and large movement, but had few applications to large deformation and large rotation problems because the false volume expansion and other issues exist. In this study it is shown that the false volume expansion in NMM can be excellently resolved by using the S–R (strain–rotation) decomposition theorem which can precisely reflect complex physical behaviors occurring in the process of large rotation and large deformation. The numerical methods based on the S–R decomposition theorem have been limited to the static analysis of large deformations. To remove this limitation, a new formulation taking into account dynamical features is proposed based on the weak form of momentum conservation law. Under the framework of NMM, the generalized-αmethod is employed to discretize the temporal variables. The updates of variables are described using the updated co-moving coordinate system. Thus, a new method named S–R-D-based NMM is established. The new formulation can be implemented in any other partition of unity based methods as well, so as to improve the performances of such methods in the analysis of dynamic large deformations.Global reference systemCo-moving coordinate systemPosition vector of a point before deformationPosition vector of a point after deformationDisplacement vector of a pointVelocity vector of a pointAcceleration vector of a pointSpecified vector of a pointSpecified traction vector of a pointForce per unit volumeBasis vector corresponding to initial co-moving coordinate systemBasis vector corresponding to the co-moving coordinate system after deformationTransformation function betweengi0andgiKronecker-deltaDisplacement derivativeChristoffel symbol of the second kindStrain tensorLinear strain tensorNonlinear strain tensorLocal mean rotation tensorUnit vector of the rotation axisMean rotation angleArea coordinates of any point(x,y)Partition of unity functionStar coordinatesArea of a triangular mesh covering one manifold elementParameters in terms of star coordinatesConstants with regard toak,bk,ck,k=1,2,3StressMaterial tensorMaterial densityTimeTime increment or time step sizeVirtual work of inertia forceVirtual work of constraint force of specified displacementVirtual work of external forcePenalty parameterDisplacement vector of a manifold elementVelocity vector of a manifold elementAcceleration vector of a manifold elementInterpolation matrixStrain vector of a manifold elementLinear strain vector of a manifold elementNonlinear strain vector of a manifold elementLinear strain–displacement matrixNonlinear strain–displacement matrixElement stiffness matrixMass matrix of a manifold elementEquivalent force vector of a manifold elementAlgorithmic parameters of generalized-αSpectral radius of generalized-α

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In theoretical and applied solid mechanics, cases of geometric and physical nonlinearities should be considered. Many formulations can be used to deal with these two types of nonlinear problems. The Lagrangian formulation, which contains the total Lagrangian formulation (T.L.) and updated Lagrangian formulation (U.L.), and the Eulerian formulation are the two classic formulations. Unlike T.L. and U.L, which adopt a material description, the Eulerian formulation adopts a spatial description  [1], in which the mesh is fixed in space. This formulation is widely used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation (ALE)  [2–5] is successful in taking advantage of the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulation. To eliminate limitations of the mesh, the element-free Galerkin method (EFG)  [6] and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM)  [7] have been used to model large deformations  [8,9]. Besides, a mesh-free method called the cracked particle method is very suitable for the simulation of complex crack evolution in two- or three-dimensions  [10,11]. The material point method (MPM)  [12,13] can also be employed  [14]. Alternative methods include the natural element method (NEM)  [15,16], the co-rotational formulation  [17,18], and the nearest-nodes finite element method (NN-FEM)  [19]. Moreover, the lattice spring model (LSM)  [20] and the distinct lattice spring model (DLSM)  [21] were used for large deformation analysis. In addition, an ALE formulation for EFG was proposed  [22]. The ALE was embedded into the extended finite element method (XFEM)  [23] and was applied to the modeling of thixoforming processes  [24].The numerical manifold method (NMM), which utilizes the dual systems of the mathematical cover (MC) and physical cover (PC) and belongs to the partition of unity (PU) method  [25,26], was initially developed in 1991  [27]. Concurrently, a simplex integration method for NMM, the finite element method (FEM), discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA), and analytical analysis were proposed  [28]. Owing to the dual cover system, NMM can be used to model continuous and discontinuous problems in a uniform manner. As a result, the method has drawn attention from many researchers. Formulations of high-order approximations have been derived in detail  [29]. Like other PU-based methods, linear dependency  [25] exists in high-order NMMs, and leads directly to the occurrence of singularities in the global matrix. An algorithm for predicting the rank deficiency of the global stiffness matrix was provided in  [30], and was extended in  [31]. Recently, a new procedure for eliminating linear dependency was developed  [32]. For finite cover generation, in addition, a generalized and efficient procedure was suggested in  [33]. A strategy of multilayer covers was introduced into NMM in  [34].A major role of NMM is to analyze the propagation of cracks  [35–37]. Some new strategies for solving the issues with NMM in the simulation of crack propagation were recently suggested  [38]. NMM has also been used for studying fluid flow  [39], seepage flow  [40,41] and plate bending  [42]. Different from NMM, which introduces two independent cover systems over the problem domain to reproduce discontinuity in solution, the phantom node method (PNM)  [43–45], which uses the superposed elements or phantom nodes near discontinuous interface and the signed distance function and Heaviside function to achieve a discontinuous approximation, was employed to simulate the arbitrary crack problems  [46]. Though, the crack kinematics obtained with this method are identical to the step-enriched XFEM  [45,47], it is more convenient to treat complex crack configurations and the Edge-based smoothed phantom node method was proposed in  [48].However, NMM, which can be applied to both small and large deformation analyses as well as static and dynamic analyses at the same time, has rarely been reported.As we know, Green’s strain tensor, which is widely adopted for use in the large strain analysis, successfully eliminates the false strain caused by a finite rotation. However, the definition of a rotation that is compatible with Green’s strain is non-existent, restricting its applicability to large deformations and rotations  [49]. On the other hand, classical polar decomposition  [50], which can be used to decompose strain and rotation from a given deformation gradient field, is based only on mathematical considerations. Namely, the deformed configuration can be achieved through a pure stretch transformation proceeding to a rigid rotation transformation, or vice versa. This decomposition unavoidably results in two distinct strains, i.e. the pre-rotation strain and the post-rotation strain. In contrast, for the S–R (strain–rotation) decomposition theorem proposed in  [51], the strain and local rotation occur simultaneously and without order, and the strain is uniquely determined  [52]. Moreover, the local rotation is represented in a simple analytical form  [53]. Furthermore, the S–R decomposition theorem has been applied to the analysis of static large deformations  [54,55].Since the 1990s, formulations based on the S–R decomposition theorem for static large deformation problems have been featured in the literature. However, a formulation for dynamic large deformation problems remains absent. In this study, we extend the application of the S–R decomposition theorem by using the weak form of momentum conservation law to deduce a new formulation for dynamic deformation problems. The novel formulation is appropriate for both static and dynamic analyses, involving small and large deformations or rotations. To obtain the discrete form of the new formulation, NMM  [27] and the generalized-αmethod  [56] are adopted. Thus, a new S–R-D-based NMM is established. Although this new formulation is implemented in the context of NMM, it could undoubtedly be employed by other PU-based methods, such as GFEM/XFEM, EFG, to name just a few. The analysis results of some interesting and challenging examples suggest that the introduction of the S–R decomposition to the simulation of dynamic and large deformation is promising.The S–R decomposition theorem is always associated with the co-moving coordinate description method. The connection between the theorem and the co-moving coordinate has been demonstrated and illuminated in detail in  [49,51–55]. Here, for completeness, we provide statements of the related concepts and theories.For a deformable body in Euclidean spaceE3, the following two reference frames are chosen to describe the motion of a body:(1)A global reference system{Xi}(i=1, 2, 3), which is fixed in space.A co-moving coordinate system{xi}(i=1, 2, 3), which is embedded in the deformable body, with its coordinate line allowed to stretch and rotation.In general, the initial reference frame or the initial co-moving coordinate system is chosen as a rectilinear or curvilinear orthogonal system. However, owing to the occurrence of a deformation of the considered body or structure, a new curvilinear system may be formed following the deformation. Fig. 1shows the configuration change of a co-moving coordinate system in the two-dimensional case. The situation is similar in the three-dimensional case. LetrandRbe the position vectors of a point before and after deformation, and letudenote the displacement vector. Thus, one can obtain(1)R=r+u.We define the basis vectors at a point in the initial co-moving coordinate system by(2)gi0=∂r∂xi,i=1,2,3.After deformation, the basis vectors at the same point change to(3)gi=∂R∂xi,i=1,2,3.Using Eq. (1), we have(4)∂R∂xi=∂r∂xi+∂u∂xi.In the curvilinear system(5)∂u∂xi=∂∂xi(ujgj0)=uj|igj0.Then, we obtain the following transformation of basis vectors(6)gi=Fijgj0whereFijis a linear differential transformation function and can be described as(7)Fij=δij+uj|iwhereδijis the Kronecker-delta. The covariant derivativeuj|iof displacement is expressed as(8)uj|i=∂uj∂xi+Γikj0ukwhereΓikj0is known as the Christoffel symbol  [57] of the second kind, and can be written as  [49,53](9)Γikj0=12gjl0(∂gli0∂xk+∂glk0∂xi−∂gik0∂xl).It should be pointed out thatgi0andgirepresent two very important local basis vectors; the stretch and the rotation of a deformable body are reflected precisely through the transformation of these vectors.On the other hand, the S–R decomposition theorem  [49,51–55] states that any invertible linear differential transformation functionFyields a unique additive decomposition:(10)F=S+RwhereSis a symmetry sub-transformation representing the strain tensor and is positive definite, andRis an orthogonal sub-transformation representing the local mean rotation tensor.The strain tensor is(11)Sji=12(ui|j+ui|jT)−LkiLjk(1−cosθ)and the rotation tensor is(12)Rji=δji+Ljisinθ+LkiLjk(1−cosθ)whereLjiis the unit vector of the rotation axis, anduj|iis the displacement gradient. The superscriptTdenotes the transpose, and the notation “|i” represents the covariant derivative with respect togi0. AndLjican be written as(13)Lji=12sinθ(ui|j−ui|jT).The mean rotation angleθis determined by the following formula(14)sinθ=12(u1|2−u1|2T)2+(u2|3−u2|3T)2+(u1|3−u1|3T)2.For two-dimensional problems, Eq. (14) reduces to(15)sinθ=12(u1|2−u1|2T).In addition, the strainSjican be written as  [39,43](16)Sji=12(ui|j+ui|jT)+δji(1−cosθ).It should be noted that, in accordance with the theory of tensor analysis, the corresponding physical components should be adopted in the calculation.NMM  [27] consists of four interrelated parts  [39]: the cover systems, the partition of unity functions, the NMM space, and a variational formulation fitting to the method. One can refer to  [27,38,39,58] for more details on the orthodox statements of NMM. Assume that the problem domainΩ, as shown in Fig. 2, consists of two solid black boundaries and a black dotted line to represent a cracked surface. The mathematical cover (MC) is a collection of simply connected domains, represented in Fig. 1 as red polygons, circles, or ellipses. Each of these simply connected domains can be, in principle, of arbitrary shape and is called a mathematical patch (MP). Different MPs may partially overlap, but all the MPs must coverΩcompletely. The configuration of the MC, including the sizes and shapes of these mathematical patches, determines the partition of unity functions to be expounded subsequently. Physical patches (PPs) are created by cutting all of the MPs using the components ofΩ, namely the boundary, material interface, and cracks. The collection of all the PPs then is referred to as the physical cover (PC). The manifold elements are disjointed subdomains, which can serve as the basic units in integration of the weak form of the problem.Now, let us take a three-node triangular mesh as an example (see Fig. 3[59]) to illustrate the formation process of manifold elements in more detail, because this is closely related to the assembly of the global stiffness matrix.Assume that the triangleΔABCconstitutes the problem domain,Ω. The thick linesAB,B C, andCA, are the boundaries ofΩ, whereas the thick dashed line DF is a crack. Consider the triangleΔ123. Under the finite element cover, all the triangles sharing an identical node, referred to as a star, constitute an MP. For stars 1, 2, and 3, the MPs areMP1,MP2,andMP3, respectively. The PPs are formed by splitting the MPs with the components ofΩ. For example, the physical patchesPP1−1andPP1−2are both formed fromMP1. The process in which one mathematical patch derives multiple physical patches will be referred to as an “MP split” or “star split” in this paper. In a similar fashion, we can obtainPP2,PP3−1, andPP3−2. According to the theory of NMM, manifold elementE, as shown in Fig. 3, is the common part ofPP1−2,PP2, andPP3−2, implying that every manifold element is affected by three physical patches.On the other hand, the shape function of the three-node triangle is chosen as the PU function, as shown in Fig. 4. The area coordinates of any point(x,y)in the element of NMM are defined by(17)Lk=ak+bkx+cky2Δ,k=1,2,3where(18)Δ=12det[1x1y11x2y21x3y3]and(19)a1=x2y3−x3y2,b1=y2−y3,c1=x3−x2with a cyclic rotation of indices 1, 2, and 3. Here,(x1,y1),(x2,y2)and(x3,y3)are three “star” of the triangular mesh covering the element. Moreover, for the three-node triangle, the PU is given by(20)φ1=L1,φ2=L2,φ3=L3andφk,k=1,2,3can be written as(21)(φ1φ2φ3)=(f11f12f13f21f22f23f31f32f33)(1xy)whereflk(l,k=1,2,3)are constants with regard toxk,yk(k=1,2,3), with the exact expressions in  [60]. By restrictingφk, as defined onMPkontoPPk, we obtain the PU subordinate to thePPk.Compared with FEM, in the construction of the approximation to the solution NMM focuses more on physical patches rather than individual elements. Over each physical patchPPk, we define a local displacement approximationuk={uk(x,y),vk(x,y)}T. Given alluk={uk(x,y),vk(x,y)}T, from the viewpoint of the PU, we paste them together with the corresponding PU to obtain the NMM space defined overΩ. In principle, the local displacement approximation can be given in terms of constant, linear, or high-order polynomials, or a locally defined series. In this study, constants are taken as the local displacement approximation.Based on the S–R decomposition, the weak form of momentum conservation law can be applied to establish the incremental governing equation, with respect to the current configuration.Assume that the solutions for the static and kinematic variables have been obtained for the time steps from time 0 up to timet, inclusively, and that the subsequent solution for timet+Δtis now targeted. The procedure to obtain the solution for the next configuration is representative, and can be carried out repetitively until all the time steps are completed. At timet+Δt, the weak form of momentum conservation law for the deformable body can be expressed as(22)∫t+ΔtΩt+Δtσjiδ(t+ΔtSij)dΩ+t+ΔtFin e+t+ΔtFpen−t+ΔtFext=0where the terms on the left-hand side represent the virtual work corresponding to the inner force, inertia force, constraint force of specified displacement, and the surface and body forces, respectively.σjiis the stress, andδSijis the virtual strain. Moreover,(23)t+ΔtFin e=t+Δt(∫ΩρWiδuidΩ)(24)t+ΔtFpen=t+Δt(∫Γuki(Δui−Δu⌣i)δuidS)and(25)t+ΔtFext=t+Δt(∫ΓPP⌣iδuidS+∫ΩρfiδuidΩ).Here,ρis the material density,Wiis the acceleration,δuiis the virtual displacement, andkiis the penalty number.ΔuiandΔu⌣irepresent the undetermined and specified displacements, respectively.P⌣iis the specified traction, andfiis the force per unit volume. Throughout this study, the superscriptt+Δtimplies that the representation refers to the configuration of timet+Δt. It should be noted that Eq. (22) is now specified with respect to the co-moving coordinate systemt+Δtgi.In the incremental intervalΔtbetween timetand timet+Δt, we take(26)t+Δtu=tu+Δu(27)t+Δtσji=tσji+Δσji(28)t+ΔtSji=tSji+ΔSji(29)Δσji=tDjlikΔSjiwhereΔu,ΔσjiandΔSjiare the undetermined displacement increment, stress increment and strain increment, respectively.tDjkilis the material tensor associated with the rate-form constitutive laws. The strain increment can be written as(30)ΔSji=ΔSLji+ΔSNjiwhereΔSLjiandΔSNjiare the undetermined linear and nonlinear parts of strain increment, respectively. For timet+Δt, the values of all variables are known at timet, namely(31)δ(t+ΔtSji)=δ(ΔSji)and(32)δ(t+Δtu)=δ(Δu).In this study,ρ,ki, andfiare all treated as constant. At arbitrary time, the specified stress and displacement boundary conditions might be known; however, the configuration of timet+Δtis unknown. Therefore, the following approximation can be employed, and using Eq. (32) gives(33)t+ΔtFpen≈tFpen=∫tΓuki(Δui−tΔu⌣i)δ(Δui)dS.In the same manner, we have(34)t+ΔtFext≈tFext=∫tΓPtP⌣iδ(Δui)dS+∫tΩρfiδ(Δui)dΩandt+ΔtFin ebecomes(35)t+ΔtFin e=∫t+ΔtΩρt+ΔtWiδ(Δui)dΩ.Substituting Eqs. (27), (29), and (30) into Eq. (22) and considering Eqs. (33)–(35), one can obtain(36)∫tΩtσjiδ(ΔSLij+ΔSNij)dΩ+∫tΩtDjlik(ΔSLkl+ΔSNkl)δ(ΔSLij+ΔSNij)dΩ+t+ΔtFin e+tFpen−tFext=0.This is the so-called incremental variational equation, where the superscripttimplies that the description is with respect to the configuration of timet, and the following is the same. It is should be mentioned that the known variable values in Eq. (36) refer to the co-moving coordinate systemtgi.In order to establish the updated co-moving coordinate formulation of the incremental equation, similar to  [55], the initial co-moving systemtgi0at timetis chosen as the reference frame of the co-moving coordinate systemtgiat timet. Here are the main three reasons for this choice:(i) Simplifying the derivation and calculation.When the solving of the incremental equation, the initial co-moving system of each incremental step is required to be reselected and is constantly changing. That is, from timetto timet+Δt, the initial co-moving system is given bytgi0at timet; whereas, from timet+Δtto timet+Δt+Δt, the initial co-moving system is defined byt+Δtgi0at timet+Δt, as shown in Fig. 5. When isomorphic coordinate systems are chosen, the Christoffel symbol of the second kind,Γikj0, will vanish from Eq. (8). The covariant derivativeuj|ibecomes(37)uj|i=∂uj∂xi.Therefore, the related deduction and calculation can be simplified significantly. Henceforth,Γikj0will no longer be required, unless otherwise noted.(ii) Transforming Eq. (36) into an equation referring to the initial co-moving systemtgi0at timet.Because the first two terms (FTT) in Eq. (36) involve only stress and strain, it can be written as(38)FTT=∫tΩσ̄jiδ(ΔS̄Lij+ΔS̄Nij)dΩ+∫tΩD̄jlik(ΔS̄Lij+ΔS̄Nij)δ(ΔS̄Lij+ΔS̄Nij)dΩwhere the overline “-” indicates that the variable refers totgi0. In the rate-form constitutive laws, for an isotropic material,D̄jkil=Djkilwas proved by  [55]. Next, the virtual work of the inertia forcet+ΔtFin ewill be further disposed. At timet+Δt, the acceleration vector  [49,53] can be defined by(39)W=t+ΔtWit+Δtgi=t+Δt(∂Vi∂t+VjVi||j)t+Δtgi.As for the first term in Eq. (39), owing to the fact that the space derivative is not involved, we have(40)t+Δt(∂Vi∂t)t+Δtgi=(∂V̄̄i∂t)t+Δtgi0where the double overline “=” indicates that the variable refers tot+Δtgi0in order to distinguish from the variable referring totgi0. Furthermore, for the second term in Eq. (39), using the following two equations  [55](41)t+Δtgi=(∂t+Δtxj∂xi)t+Δtgi0(42)t+ΔtVi||j∂t+Δtxk∂xi=t+ΔtV̄̄k|i∂txi∂xjwe can obtain(43)W=t+ΔtWit+Δtgi=t+Δt(∂Vi∂t+VjVi||j)t+Δtgi=(∂V̄̄i∂t+V̄̄jV̄̄i|j)t+Δtgi0=W̄̄it+Δtgi0.By using Eq. (43),t+ΔtFin e, in reference tot+Δtgi0, can be expressed as(44)t+ΔtFin e=F̄̄in e=∫t+ΔtΩρ(∂V̄̄i∂t+V̄̄jV̄̄i|j)δ(Δū̄i)dΩ.On the other hand, with respect totgi0andt+Δtgi0, the displacement increment vectors can be written as(45)Δu=Δūitgi0=Δū̄it+Δtgi0.Becausetgi0andt+Δtgi0are isomorphic, namely,(46)Δūi=Δū̄i.Thus, Eq. (44) becomes(47)t+ΔtFin e=F̄̄in e=∫t+ΔtΩρ(∂V̄̄i∂t+V̄̄jV̄̄i|j)δ(Δūi)dΩ.Moreover, with respect totgi0, we have(48)tFpen=F̄pen=∫tΓuki(Δui−tΔu⌣i)δ(Δūi)dSand(49)tFext=F̄ext=∫tΓPtP⌣iδ(Δūi)dS+∫tΩρfiδ(Δūi)dΩ.Hence, the incremental governing equation (36) becomes(50)∫tΩσ̄jiδ(ΔS̄Lij+ΔS̄Nij)dΩ+∫tΩD̄jlik(ΔS̄Lkl+ΔS̄Nkl)δ(ΔS̄Lij+ΔS̄Nij)dΩ+F̄̄in e+F̄pen−F̄ext=0.Eqs. (47)–(50) exactly express the so-called virtual work equation, which is based on the S–R decomposition theorem and described in the updated co-moving coordinate form. The equations will be disposed further in the context of NMM. It should be pointed out that Eqs. (47)–(50) are based on the principle of virtual displacement rather than the principle of virtual power, which was adopted by  [55]. Thus, there are three main differences from the counterpart employed in  [55]: first, the rotation tensorRdoes not appear explicitly; second, the strain rate also is invisible; and third, the inertia item is primarily considered. In our experience a dynamic analysis cannot be achieved by merely inserting the inertia item into the static formulation in  [55]. This implies that a new deducing process is needed to obtain the dynamic formulation.(iii) Providing theoretical basis for updating the co-moving coordinate and state variables of material point.For the case that these aforementioned initial co-moving systems are all selected to be isomorphic to the rectilinear orthogonal coordinate system that is fixed in the space, a formula for updating the co-moving coordinate of the material point has been given in  [55]:(51)t+Δtxi=txi+ΔūiwhereΔūiis the displacement increment in thetgi0system duringΔt. As for the stress, the following formula can be adopted:(52)t+Δtσ̄ji=tσ̄ji+Δσji=tσ̄ji+tD̄jlik(ΔS̄Lkl+ΔS̄Nkl).Now, we construct the S–R-D-based NMM. In order to facilitate the description, “-” and “=” at the top of some variables are omitted from this point on, unless otherwise noted. In this study, the same interpolation is applied to the displacementu, velocityV, and accelerationW.Considering an arbitrary shape elementE, as shown in Fig. 6, the stars 1, 2, and 3 representMP1,MP2, andMP3, respectively. For any point(x,y)inside the elementE, we have(53)u(x,y)=(ux(x,y)uy(x,y))=N(x,y)ue(54)Δu(x,y)=(Δux(x,y)Δuy(x,y))=N(x,y)Δue(55)V(x,y)=(vx(x,y)vy(x,y))=N(x,y)Ve(56)ΔV(x,y)=(Δvx(x,y)Δvy(x,y))=N(x,y)ΔVe(57)W(x,y)=(wx(x,y)wy(x,y))=N(x,y)We.Here,ue={u1x,u1y,u2x,u2y,u3x,u3y}TandΔue={Δu1x,Δu1y,Δu2x,Δu2y,Δu3x,Δu3y}Tare the displacement vector and the displacement increment vector of the element, respectively.Ve={v1x,v1y,v2x,v2y,v3x,v3y}TandΔVe={Δv1x,Δv1y,Δv2x,Δv2y,Δv3x,Δv3y}Tare the velocity vector and the velocity increment vectors, respectively; andWe={w1x,w1y,w2x,w2y,w3x,w3y}Tis the acceleration vector. In addition,(58)N(x,y)=[L10L20L300L10L20L3]whereLk(k=1,2,3)is the shape function of the three-node triangle (see Eq. (17)). Let us recall Eqs. (11) and (16), to obtain(59)Se(x,y)={S11S222S21}=SeL+SeN={u1|1u2|2u1|2+u2|1}+{1−cosθ1−cosθ0}whereSeLandSeNare the linear and nonlinear strain vectors of the element, respectively. On the one hand, the linear strain vector can be written as(60)SeL(x,y)={u1|1,u2|2,u1|2+u2|1}T=BeLuewhere(61)BeL=[f120f220f3200f130f230f33f13f12f23f22f33f32].On the other hand, if the approximationsinθ≈θ(62)cosθ≈1−12θ2is to be employed, the nonlinear strain vector in Eq. (59) can be recast as(63)SeN={1−cosθ1−cosθ0}≈BeNuewhere(64)BeN={18LNueLN18LNueLN0}and(65)LN=[∂∂y,−∂∂x]N(x,y).In order to reduce the degree of nonlinearity, pertaining to the strain increment, the following variant of Eq. (64) is chosen in this study.(66)B̃eN={18LNΔue∗LN18LNΔue∗LN0}whereΔue∗is the displacement increment of the element corresponding to the previous calculation step. Our numerical calculations suggest that the choice is effective. Thus, the strain increment vectorsΔSeLandΔSeNcan be written as(67)ΔSeL(x,y)=BeLΔueΔSeN(x,y)=B̃eNΔue.Noticing the arbitrariness ofδ(Δue), Eq. (50) can be recast in the following matrix format:(68)KeΔue+∫tΩρNTNWedΩ︸Dynamic terms=Fext−Fpen−∫tΩ(BeL+B̃eN)TσdΩwhere(69)Ke=∫tΩBeLTDBeLdΩ+∫tΩBeLTDB̃eNdΩ+∫tΩB̃eNTDBeLdΩ+∫tΩB̃eNTDB̃eNdΩwhereKeandDare the element stiffness matrix and material matrix respectively, and(70)Fpen=∫tΓuNTk(NΔu−Δu⌣)dS(71)Fext=∫tΓPNTP⌣dS+∫tΩρNTfdΩwhereΔu⌣andP⌣are the specified displacement and specified traction of any point on the boundary of the element, respectively.fis the force per unit volume of the element. The penalty matrixkis(72)k=[kx00ky].It should be noted that the definitions of the stress  [49,53] and the velocity  [53] must be employed, with respect to the co-moving coordinate system. Next, the disposition of the dynamic term in Eq. (68) will be illustrated in detail based on the generalized-αmethod  [56], which is a type of implicit method for dynamic analysis.

The global control equation can then easily be assembled. Thus, the S–R-D-based NMM is established completely. Although Eq. (79) has been deduced in the context of NMM, the equations would be suitable as a basis for various other PU-based methods, such as FEM, GFEM/XFEM, and EFG.In this section, several classical tests are given in order to validate the availability and potential application of the S–R-D-based NMM.We now use the example of a static large deformation of a cantilever beam under a point load at the free tip (Fig. 7) to examine the S–R-D-based NMM.The governing equation of a uniform cross-section beam with large deformation is  [62](80)d2θdζ2+αcosθ=0,θ(0)=0,θ′(1)=0and the dimensionless quantities are defined as(81)ζ=sL,α=FL2EIwheresis the arc-coordinate of the neutral axis of the beam,Lis the length of the beam,Fis the point load at the free tip,E Iis the bending stiffness of the beam, andθis the rotation of cross-section of the beam. The length, depth, and width of the beam are 10, 1, and 1, respectively. The material of the beam is assumed to be elastic with no damage. Young’s Modulus isE=3.0×106and Poisson’s ratio isν=0. The discrete model of the cantilever beam, containing 2729 elements, is shown in Fig. 8.Forα=1.0(F=2500), a series of load increments ranging fromΔF=25/CStoΔF=1250/CSare adopted. Here, CS means calculation step. We will focus on the rotation angleθ(1)at the free end point. The calculated values obtained by the original NMM (NMM0) and the S–R-D-based NMM (NMM∗) respectively are given in Table 1together with the corresponding absolute errors (AE) and relative errors (RE). From Table 1, as we can see, the calculated deflection values given byNMM0are much larger than the reference values by  [61]. This is because the false strain ascribed to the rotation has not been ruled out. On the other hand, usingNMM∗allows that satisfactory approximate values can still be obtained even though the load increment is as large asΔF=625/CS. Two snapshots of the cantilever beam after deformation are shown in Fig. 9.ForΔF=50and different values ofα, the reference values (RV) and calculated values (CV) given byNMM∗are tabulated in Table 2as along with the corresponding AEs and REs. All of the REs are satisfactory and most of them are less than 1%. Fig. 10further demonstrates the calculation results.A column is subjected to an eccentric compressive loadF, as shown in Fig. 11. Young’s modulus of the material is taken as 106 units and Poisson’s ratio as zero. The non-dimensional lengthL, widthH, and thicknesstare taken as 10, 1 and 1, respectively. The discrete model of the column, containing 1460 elements, is shown in Fig. 11.The problem is solved for horizontal and vertical tip-deflections at checking point A. Some results are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Fig. 12further demonstrates the column after deformation.From Fig. 12, we can see that the false strain, which is caused by the rotation, leads to the deformation given byNMM0is significantly larger than that byNMM∗.The inner and external diameters of the flexible semi-ring arer=0.9andR=1.0, respectively, and the distance between the lowest point of the semi-ring and the highest point of base isH=1.0, as shown in Fig. 13. For both the semi-ring and base, Young’s modulusE=1.0×107and Poisson’s ratioυ=0.24are adopted. The density of the semi-ring is given byρ=2000and the acceleration of gravity isg=−10. The penalty parameter is given byp=20E. In addition, the real time interval per calculation step is given byΔ=0.001s, and the total number of calculation step (CS) isCS=800. Moreover, the spectral radius of the generalized-αmethod  [56] is given byρ∞=1.The flexible semi-ring falls freely until CS  =  442, at the moment it just contacts the base, and then at CS  =  525, the points B and D all reach the lowest position and the flexible semi-ring starts to rebound under the contact force. At CS  =  572, the semi-ring is completely separate from the base, as shown in Fig. 14.The semi-ring continues ascending. At CS  =  604, the distance between points A and E reaches the maximum; whereas, at CS  =  652, the point C reaches the highest position and the flexible semi-ring starts to fall, as shown in Fig. 15. At CS  =  735, the flexible semi-ring starts to rebound secondly and the point C again reaches the highest position at CS  =  798, as shown in Fig. 16.In addition, from CS  =  400 to 610 with an interval of 15, namely, CS  =  400:15:610, a series of deformations of the flexible semi-ring are shown in Fig. 17; whereas these deformations corresponding to from CS  =  620 to 800 with CS  =  620:15:800, are shown in Fig. 18. From the two figures, as for the change of the central axis of the flexible semi-ring, it is can be observed that there is a distinct difference between the results given byNMM0and those byNMM∗. Generally speaking, the large deformation given byNMM0is more serious than that byNMM∗. We believe that one important reason is the false strain caused by the rotation is not removed inNMM0.A rod (L=10.00m,h=0.10m) is shown in Fig. 19. The left endpoint O(0, 0) serves as the center of rotation and point A(10, 0) is the right endpoint. The three vertexes of the triangle covering the rod areA∗(−2.953952,−4.592217),B∗(12.953952,−4.592217)andC∗(5,9.184432), respectively. The rod falls freely from a horizontal position by gravity. Let the acceleration of gravityg=−10m/s2, Young’s modulusE=1.0×1012Pa, Poisson’s ratioυ=0.45and the penalty parameterP=100E. And the spectral radius of the generalized-αmethod  [56]ρ∞=1. In order to analyze the time step sensitivity, several time step lengths, i.e.Δt=0.001, 0.002, 0.0003, 0.005, 0.001, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 s, are adopted during the calculation. Some calculation values on area of the rod are listed in Table 5. The maximum angular velocities (MAV) of clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation during one period are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Because the relative errors of the area of the rod are significant, forNMM0the corresponding calculations have not be done whenΔt>0.005s.As Table 5 shows, for the same total real time, i.e. 5 s, whenΔt=0.001s, the relative errors of the area of the rod are 0.74780% and 0.00002% corresponding toNMM0andNMM∗, respectively. Along with the increment ofΔt, the relative errors given byNMM0as well as that given byNMM∗are listed. However, forNMM0the relative error has already reached to 3.75729% whenΔt=0.005s; while forNMM∗the relative error is less than 0.8% even thoughΔt=0.2s.For the clockwise rotation of the rod, from Table 6 we can see that the relative errors of the maximum angular velocity are −0.2280% and −0.0020% respectively whenΔt=0.005s; AlthoughΔt=0.2sthe relative error given byNMM∗is only −0.6691%. From the rightmost column of Table 6, in addition, it can be observed that the maximum angular velocities per calculation step have a range of values from−0.099238°to−19.715033°.As for the anti-clockwise rotation of the rod, whenΔt=0.005swe can find that the relative errors of the maximum angular velocity are −0.7588% and −0.0022% forNMM0andNMM∗, respectively; AlthoughΔt=0.2sthe relative error (−1.4113%) given byNMM∗is still acceptable. As shown in Table 7, under this condition the maximum angular velocities per calculation step is19.567725°.ForΔt=0.003sand CS  =  1000, the trajectory of point A is shown in Fig. 20. From the result provided byNMM0, i.e.  Fig. 20(a), the offset of the trajectory can be observed easily, which implies the expansion of the rod. While this is not the case forNMM∗, see Fig. 20(b). This example shows that for a wider range of values for the time step the S–R-D-based NMM is always valid.In Fig. 21, the triangleΔABC(AB=BC=CA=0.8m)represents a rigid body, with Young’s modulusE=1.0×103GPa, Poisson’s ratioυ=0.45and densityρ=10kg/m2. The triangleΔA∗B∗C∗, withA∗B∗=B∗C∗=C∗A∗=3mandOA∗=OB∗=OC∗=1.0m, covers the rigid body. The barycentres of the two triangles coincide with point O, which will be the center of rotation if the initial velocities|VA∗|=|VB∗|=|VC∗|=v̄0are applied to the pointsA∗,B∗, andC∗, respectively. However, if the point loadF0is applied only to the point O at the first step, the rigid body will move horizontally at a constant speed. If the gravityGis always acting at point O, the rigid body will fall freely. To observe the trajectories of points D and O, the movement of the rigid body will be simulated under two kinds of conditions, i.e.v̄0+F0andv̄0+F0+G, respectively. In this example, the values ofF0=0.277128N,G=−0.001N, andv̄0=0.1m/sare adopted, giving the constant angular velocity ofω=−0.1rad/s≈−5.730°/s. The real time interval per CS is given byΔ=0.1s; thus, the angular velocity isω̃=−0.01rad/CS≈−0.5730°/CS. The total number of CS isn=10100. That is, the total time is 1010 s. Moreover, the spectral radius of the generalized-αmethod  [56] is given byρ∞=1.For the conditionv̄0+F0, some results obtained usingNMM0andNMM∗are listed in Table 8.From Table 8, we can see that the computational accuracies of the angular velocity and the area of the rigid body are all significantly improved byNMM∗. For example, when CS  =  10000, the REs of the area of the rigid body are approximately 99.98% and 0.0005% corresponding toNMM0andNMM∗, respectively; whereas the REs of the angular velocity are approximately −29.29% and −0.47%. Figs. 22 and 23illustrate the trajectories of the two points D and O. ForNMM0, see Fig. 23, which clearly shows that the period of rotation is progressively magnified and the rigid body is gradually expanding. However, forNMM∗, in reference to Fig. 23, the period of rotation and the area of the rigid body remains unchanged (see Table 8).For the conditionv̄0+F0+G, the trajectories of points D and O given byNMM0andNMM∗are sketched in Fig. 24. From this Figure, it is observed that the trajectories (the two parabolas) of point O given byNMM0andNMM∗basically coincide; on the other hand, the two trajectories of point D gradually separate with the exception of the first period. Moreover, from the detailed view in Fig. 24, it can be seen that the end points of these trajectories are coincident. This implies that the displacements of point O given byNMM0andNMM∗are identical, however, the rigid body has gone through different paths. Additionally, it can be noted that the expansion of the rigid body is caused byNMM0.This test demonstrates that the mass of an element can be perfectly conservative using S–R-D-based NMM, along with a satisfactory precision in the angular velocity, which is not the case for the original NMM.As an aside, Jiang and Zheng recently gave an efficient remedy for the false volume expansion of DDA in simulating large rotation  [63] by fixing a local frame moving and rotating with each block.
