@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The importance of evaluating complications and toxicity during and following treatment has been stressed in many publications. In most studies, these endpoints are presented descriptively and summarized by numbers and percentages but descriptive methods are rarely sufficient to evaluate treatment-related complications. Pepe and Lancar developed Prevalence and Weighted Prevalence functions which take into account the duration and the severity of complication unlike conventional methods of survival analysis or competing risks which are limited to the time to first event. The purpose of this paper is to describe features and use of two R functions, main.preval.func and main.wpreval.func, which were designed for the analysis of survival adjusted for quality of life. These functions compute descriptive statistics, survival and competing risks analysis and especially Prevalence and Weighted Prevalence estimations with confidence intervals and associated test statistics. The use of these functions is illustrated by several examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In cancer clinical trials, survival is often used as the primary endpoint of interest. However, assessment of side effects in patients during and after the initial treatment phase has become an important factor in the evaluation of therapeutic strategies. In fact, new targeted therapies have permitted an increase in patient survival, but to the detriment of early and/or late side effects, which can evolve over time in severity. They can get better or worse or disappear altogether. Those that persist may have a negative impact on quality of life. Taking into account the nature of these side effects as well as their intensity in the evaluation of the quality of survival is an important challenge. When outcomes are considered similar, say, in terms of overall survival, an individual may not necessarily assign the same utility to various side effects: “While the risk of dying from the primary cancer is a consequence of disease itself, treatment-related side-effects are more difficult to accept psychologically, even if they can be seen as the price for surviving the cancer, as they are actively inflicted by the therapy” [1].The importance of evaluating complications and toxicity during and following treatment has been stressed in many publications in particular for radiation therapy [2,3]. Multiple scales are available for the coding of these deleterious effects, NCI-CTC being the most common. From the perspective of the patient quality of life may be encoded by scales such as the SF-36 or other QLQC-30 [4]. Whatever the scale, all allow a classification into a particular health state which can be classified into categories ranging from 0 to 5. In most studies, these health states are presented descriptively and summarized by numbers and percentages. However, these methods are rarely sufficient to evaluate treatment-related complications. Pepe [5] proposed the prevalence function, defined as the probability of being in a specific health state at time t among patients alive without relapse. This method takes into account duration and transitions between the state of complication unlike conventional methods of survival analysis or competing risks which are limited to the time to first event. Lancar [6] developed a Weighted Prevalence function, which is obtained from the weighted sum of the prevalence function associated with a specific severity category at a specific time point. This generalization produces a score that takes into account not only the duration of the transitions but also the severity of complications.This paper provides two R functions for the analysis of survival adjusted for quality of life using Prevalence and Weighted Prevalence functions respectively. Methods as well as a small example are presented in Section 2. Both R functions are described in Section 3. In Section 4, results of a phase III randomized trial comparing two pre-operative brachytherapy low dose rates in patients with localized stage cervix carcinoma will be used for illustration [6–8].
