@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour model shows good performance at concavity convergence and initialization insensitivity, yet it is susceptible to weak edges as well as deep and narrow concavity. This paper proposes a novel external force, called adaptive diffusion flow (ADF), with adaptive diffusion strategies according to the characteristics of an image region in the parametric active contour model framework for image segmentation. We exploit a harmonic hypersurface minimal functional to substitute smoothness energy term in GVF for alleviating the possible leakage. We make use of the p(x) harmonic maps, in which p(x) ranges from 1 to 2, such that the diffusion process of the flow field can be adjusted adaptively according to image characteristics. We also incorporate an infinity laplacian functional to ADF active contour model to drive the active contours onto deep and narrow concave regions of objects. The experimental results demonstrate that ADF active contour model possesses several good properties, including noise robustness, weak edge preserving and concavity convergence.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Active contour models, or snakes [1], have been proven to be very effective tools for image segmentation, objects tracking [2–4], shape recovery [5], etc. A traditional active contour model is represented by a curve C(q)=(x(q), y(q)), q∈[0, 1], and it moves through the spatial domain of an image to minimize the energy functional(1)E(C)=∫0112(α·|Cq(q)|2+β·|Cqq(q)|2)+g(C(q))dq.The first term of the integral stands for the internal force that keeps the contour continuous and smooth during deformation, the second term is the external force that drives the contour toward an object boundary or the other desired features within an image.According to the representation and implementation, active contour models are classified into two categories: the parametric active contour models [6–9] and the geometric active contour models [10–15]. In this paper, we focus on the parametric active contour models, and our approach can be also integrated into geometric active contour models. Since the external force plays a leading role in driving the active contours to approach objects boundaries in the parametric active contour models, designing a novel external force field has been extensively studied [6,8,16–19]. Among all these external forces, gradient vector flow (GVF) proposed by Xu and Prince [8], has been one of the most successful external forces, which is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from a given image, and allowed to increase the capture range. Due to the outstanding properties of GVF, a large number of modified versions have been presented [20,16,18,21] to improve the performance of active contour models. However, researchers found that the GVF suffers from several challenges including narrow and deep concavity convergence as well as weak edge leakage.This paper aims to provide, in a rigorous mathematical framework, a new method to establish an equivalent framework between GVF diffusion process and image restoration process. We develop a novel external force for active contour models called adaptive diffusion flow (ADF), inspired by [22,23]. Our main contributions are threefold.(1)We adopt a hypersurface minimal functional to substitute smoothness energy term in the original GVF. It tends to degenerate to a uniformly elliptic equation having strong regularizing properties in all directions at locations where the variation of the intensity is weak. And, in a neighborhood of an edge presenting a strong gradient, the hypersurface minimal functional is preferable to diffuse along tangent direction of an edge so as to preserve the weak edge efficiently.We make use of the p(x) harmonic maps in which p(x) ranges from 1 to 2, such that the diffusion process of the flow field can be adjusted adaptively according to image characteristics.We also introduce an infinity laplace functional to guarantee the ADF diffusion mainly along normal direction in the homogeneous of an image so that it drives the active contours onto deep and narrow concavity. The ADF is able to efficiently suppress the influence of noise because the diffusion along tangent direction is inclined to smooth the noise while preserving edges.
