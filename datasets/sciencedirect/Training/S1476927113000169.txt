@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Labor intensive experiments are typically required to identify the causal disease variants from a list of disease associated variants in the genome. For designing such experiments, candidate variants are ranked by their strength of genetic association with the disease. However, the two commonly used measures of genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value may rank variants in different order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here we transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to genetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter plots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or −log of the p-value), with the latter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the OR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or the standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing for their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these plots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of both OR and chi-square statistic, which we term “regularized-chi”. This method selects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the right-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and chi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals from variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test statistic. As rare variants tend to have stronger functional effects, regularized-chi is better suited to the task of prioritization of candidate genes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Volcano plots are graphical tools that are commonly used in the analysis of mRNA expression levels as obtained from microarray technology (Jin et al., 2001; Cui and Churchill, 2003; Li, 2012). In principle, volcano plots are scatter plots, with each point representing a probe set or a gene, and the x-coordinate being the (log) fold-change (FC) and y being the t-statistic or −log10 of the p-value from a t-test. The reason for the popularity of volcano plot in microarray data analysis is due to its simultaneous display of two, albeit correlated, pieces of information – fold-change and t-statistic. Ranking genes by fold-change and by t-test does not necessarily lead to the same order in the differential expressed gene list, and can give rise to different biological conclusions.However, there is a fundamental relationship between log-fold-change and t-statistic: while log(FC) is a measure of the magnitude of a “signal”, the t-statistic is approximately log(FC) divided by its standard error, i.e., a signal-to-noise ratio (Zhang and Cao, 2009; Li, 2012). This means that the log(FC) is an unstandardized measure of differential expression, whereas t-statistic is a noise-level-adjusted standardized measure. The distinction between the two types of measures of differential expression has parallels to the long standing discussions in behavioral science, psychology, epidemiology, meta-analysis, and engineering under the theme of “effect size” (Cohen, 1988). As one possible strategy to address this issue, volcano plots display both measures simultaneously.In genetic association study, there has been a similar issue on deciding which measure of association is more useful: odds-ratio (OR) or χ2 test (either the chi-square test statistic or the p-value from χ2 test) (Li, 2008). Currently, most association analyses apply a χ2 test as the primary single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) selection criterion in the initial screening, and use the OR as a secondary measure in a re-examination. However, the distinction between the role of two measures and their connection has not always been explained. Because selecting candidate SNPs and regions from the first stage for the replication stage is of great practical importance, one would like to add more information in the screening stage. We believe the application of volcano plots can be beneficial towards this goal.One particular advantage of volcano plot in microarray analysis is that it provides a natural context in addressing “joint gene filtering” (Zhang and Cao, 2009; Li, 2012), which are the measures of differential expressions using both log-FC and t-statistic. In comparison, the ad hoc selection criterion such as “FC >1.5, and p-value <10−3” could be called “double gene filtering” (Zhang and Cao, 2009; Li, 2012).In a volcano plot, the discriminant lines for double filtering are right-angled lines formed by the vertical and the horizontal lines, whereas those in joint filtering are smooth curves. The well known significance analysis of microarray (SAM) (Tusher et al., 2001; Chu et al., 2007) has a discriminant line in the form of y=c0+c1/tan(θ), where θ is the angle between the y-axis and the line connecting the gene point and the plot origin (Li, 2012).Our goal in transferring volcano plots from expression analysis to genetic association analyses is to find SNP-filtering criteria that incorporate information from both OR and χ2 test results. This effort may help the prioritization of SNPs and chromosome regions in a genome-wide association study (Cantor et al., 2010). Prioritization of candidate genes has wide application in every “omics” field (Tranchevent et al., 2011; Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012). Usually, the prioritization strategies rely on external information of gene products, such as protein–protein interaction (Pattin and Moore, 2009) and pathways (Chen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2010). In contrast, our approach is purely statistical, with the underlying assumption that OR may provide more biological information than χ2-test p-value in a realistic setting (finite sample size and sample heterogeneity).The questions that are discussed in this paper are as follows: (i) How does the minor allele frequency of markers appear in a volcano plot?, (ii) How can one choose the penalty term in a regularized-chi statistic for genetic data, and is the choice of this term important?, (iii) Do any other unstandardized and standardized measurements exist that may be used for x- and y-axes in the volcano plot, besides OR and χ2 test statistic?Denote the 2×2 allele count contingency table as {nij} (i, j=1,2) where row i is the case (i=1) or control (i=2) label, and column j is the minor (j=1) or major (j=2) allele label. The minor-allele-frequency (MAF) in the case (control) group is p1=n11/(n11+n12)=n11/n1* (p2=n21/n2*). The major-allele-frequencies are q1=1−p1 (q2=1−p2) for the case (control) group.One can define several “differential allele frequency” measures that are insensitive to the sample size, for instance, the odds-ratio (OR) which is defined as n11n22/(n12n21) or p1q2/(p2q1). It is well known that the log-transformed OR, log(OR)=log(n11n22)−log(n12n21), approximately follows a normal distribution (Woolf, 1955). Another unstandardized measure is the direct calculation of allele frequency difference between the case and control group: dMAF=p1−p2=n11/n1*−n21/n2*=(n11n22−n12n21)/(n1*n2*). Furthermore, Wright's fixation index,Fst=1−(p1q1+p2q2)/(2p¯·q¯)=1−0.5n2(n11n12/n1*+n21n22/n2*)/(n*1n*2)(p¯=(p1+p2)/2,q¯=(q1+q2)/2=1−p¯) provides an unstandardized measure of differential allele frequency (Wright, 1951). Fstis a measure of allele frequency difference between two subpopulations that is used in population genetics and estimates the proportion of variations explained by population stratification. Here we assume for simplicity the two subpopulations are case and control population, with a 50:50 mixing ratio.As a standardized and sample-size sensitive measure of differential allele frequency, the χ2 statistic (n=n**=∑ijnij) (e.g., Yates, 1984; Suh and Li, 2007)(1)X2=(n11n22−n12n21)2nn1*n2*n*1n*2=n(p1−p2)2n1*n2*(p1n1*+p2n2*)(q1n1*+q2n2*)is clearly proportional to sample size n, in the asymptotic limit, given p1≠p2. Alternatively, log-OR itself can be standardized by its standard error, log(OR)/SE(log(OR)), where (Woolf, 1955)(2)SE(log(OR))=1n11+1n12+1n21+1n22=1p1q1n1*+1p2q2n2*.The standardized log(OR) is of the form of a Wald statistic.For illustration purpose, we first use a genotyping data of an autoimmune disease on one chromosome only (chromosome 6) with 809 cases and 505 controls (Freudenberg et al., 2011). The initial 38,735 SNPs are reduced to 35,855 SNPs by requiring that both the case and the control group to have at least one copy of the minor allele (which allele is the minor is defined by the control group). This removes many SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.05, though many low-MAF SNPs remain. These data are used in Figs. 1, 2 and 4.We use The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data for the type 2 diabetes (T2D), with 1924 T2D cases and 2938 controls (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Zeggini et al., 2007). Differing from several other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, there is no major susceptibility locus in MHC region for type 2 diabetes. The genotyping was carried out by the Affymetrix GeneChip 500k array. There are 459,446 autosomal SNPs which had already passed a quality control (QC) procedure by WTCCC.We impose a further filtering criterion: (i) p-value for testing unbiased typing ratio is larger than 10−4; (ii) p-value for testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the control and the case group is larger than 10−4; (ii) MAF in both control and case group is larger than 0.005. This reduces the number of SNPs to 388,023 (84.45% of the original number).Our MAF criterion is more relaxed than the 0.01 used in early analysis of these data (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Zeggini et al., 2007), which leads to the inclusion of more rare variants. Although violation of HWE in the case group might be considered as part of disease signal (Feder et al., 1996; Nielsen et al., 1998; Song and Elston, 206; Suh and Li, 2007; Li et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2012), we noticed that in this data, it actually leads to SNPs with genotype distribution inconsistent between the case and the control group (e.g. the SNP rs3777582 on chromosome 6). This data is used in Fig. 3.
