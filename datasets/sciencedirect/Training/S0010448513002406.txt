In this paper we present a novel algorithm for the multi-degree reduction of Bézier curves with geometric constraints. Based on the given constraints, we construct an objective function which is abstracted from the approximation error inL2-norm. Two types of geometric constraints are tackled. With the constraints ofG2-continuity at one endpoint andG1-continuity (orCr-continuity) at the other endpoint, we derive the optimal degree-reduced curves in explicit form. With the constraints ofG2-continuity at two endpoints, the problem of degree reduction is equivalent to minimizing a bivariate polynomial function of degree 4. Compared with the traditional methods, we derive the optimal degree-reduced curves more effectively. Finally, evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Bézier curves are one of the major modeling tools in CAD/CAM systems  [1]. Degree reduction is used to find a lower degree curve to approximate a parameter curve with certain constraints, while the approximation error is minimized. This research topic is of great importance in CAD. For examples, the highest degree of parametric curves that different design systems can code with may be different. For the convenience of data exchange and transmission between those systems, degree reduction for the curves are needed. Besides, the processes of offset approximation to curves often produce high degree curves  [1,2]. Degree reduction is sufficiently useful to compress the data. Moreover, using degree reduction, the task of finding intersection between two curves can be transformed into that between two lines  [3]. Degree reduction is also used in computing roots of polynomials. In 2009, Liu et al. presented a new cubic clipping approach for computing all the roots of a polynomial in a given interval within certain accuracy. An optimal cubic polynomial is utilized to approximate the original polynomial, which is based on degree reduction  [4].There have been many papers on this problem. The methods fall into two categories: one includes discretization methods based on geometric information such as the control points of the given curve and its derivative vectors  [5–8]; the other one includes algebraic methods based on transformation between the Bernstein and orthogonal polynomial bases  [9–14]. These methods focus on the approximating property of the given curves in different norm spaces such asL∞,L1, andL2, and mainly deal with degree reduction with parametric continuity.Most traditional methods only focus on parametric continuity, while geometric continuity is also useful in practical application, especially forG1-continuity andG2-continuity. In particular, compared with parametric continuity, geometric continuity can provide more freedom to optimize the approximation error. Hence, as far as approximation error is concerned, the degree reduction with geometric continuity is better.In 2006, Lu and Wang first presented an algorithm for degree reduction of Bézier curves withG1-continuity at two endpoints  [15]. However, to obtain the optimal numerical solution, they minimized a bivariate quartic function with conjugate gradient method. They also consideredG2-continuity at two endpoints and minimized a degree 8 function with 4 variables.In 2009, in order to reduce computational complexity, Zhou and Wang presented a proper objective function which was extracted from the approximation error inL2-norm  [16,17]. Actually, the objective function is a bivariate quadratic form. By solving linear equations, the optimal explicit solution to degree reduction of Bézier curves withG1-continuity at two endpoints was obtained. However, they did not considerG2-continuity.In 2011, Rababah and Mann presented an iterative algorithm to find theG2degree reduction of Bézier curves  [18]. Moreover, in 2013, they derived linear methods to find the multi-degree reduction of Bézier curves withG1-,G2-, andG3-continuity at the endpoints  [19]. To avoid the nonlinearity problem, they assumedC1-continuity in addition toG2- andG3-continuity. Thus, the approximation error of their methods was not optimal withG2- andG3-continuity.In this paper, we obtain the optimal degree reduction withCr-,G1- andG2-continuity. We present a good objective function, which is abstracted from the approximation error of the degree reduction inL2-norm  [16]. The given constraints can be clearly described in the objective function. With the aid of the least square method, we find the relation of the free parameters, which are given by geometric continuity. And then we simplify the nonlinear optimization problem. When the constraint condition isG2-continuity at one endpoint andG1- orCr-continuity at the other endpoint, the problem of degree reduction can be converted into finding real roots of a univariate cubic equation. So we can derive the explicit solution to it. Another constraint condition isG2-continuity at two endpoints with four free parameters. Since two parameters in the objective function can be expressed in explicit form by another two parameters, we simplify the objective function, which is actually a bivariate function of degree 4. So the computational complexity of our optimalG2approximation algorithm is less than that of  [15].In short, we present an effective method for optimal degree reduction of Bézier curves with various geometric constraints. In terms of the approximation error inL2-norm, our method is better than the traditional methods  [5–14], by which only parametric constraints were carried out. Compared with  [19], our method is optimal in terms of the approximation error. While compared with  [15], our method is efficient in terms of the computation costs and the running time.This paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we briefly describe the problem of multi-degree reduction of Bézier curves, and present an optimal algorithm to solve it with parametric continuity at two endpoints. After that, we introduce the degree reduction with various geometric continuity in Section  3. Then in Section  4, we give some examples for evaluation. We conclude this paper in Section  5.In this paper,‖⋅‖denotes the Euclidean norm, i.e.,‖v‖=v12+⋯+vn2for a vectorv=(v1,…,vn).A Bézier curve of degreenis defined by the control pointspiin the form(1)P(t)=∑i=0nBin(t)pi,t∈[0,1],whereBin(t)are the Bernstein polynomials given byBin(t)=(ni)(1−t)n−iti. For simplicity, suppose thatP(t)is a planar curve. Letpi=(xi,yi)T,Xn=(x0,…,xn)andYn=(y0,…,yn).The operatorΔthat acts on the Bézier control points is defined in the standard form as follows:Δ0pi=pi,Δ1pi=pi+1−pi,Δ2pi=pi+2+pi−2pi+1.The multi-degree reduction of the Bézier curvePn(t)given by (1) inL2-norm is to find another Bézier curve of degreem(m<n)expressed asQ(t)=∑i=0mBim(t)qi,0≤t≤1,such that the distance between these two curves inL2-norm reaches the minimum. Letqi=(x̄i,ȳi)T,X̄m=(x̄0,…,x̄m),Ȳm=(ȳ0,…,ȳm), andBn=(B0n(t),…,Bnn(t)),Bm=(B0m(t),…,Bmm(t)), we have the approximation error(2)‖P(t)−Q(t)‖L2=(∫01‖P(t)−Q(t)‖2dt)1/2=(∫01(XnBnT−X̄mBmT)2dt+∫01(YnBnT−ȲmBmT)2dt)1/2.The constraints are useful in application, such as parametric continuity or geometric continuity. The parametric continuity is described as follows.Lemma 1The curveP(t)andQ(t)preserveCr- andCs-continuity at endpoints respectively if and only if(3)P(k)(0)=Q(k)(0),0≤k≤r,(4)P(l)(1)=Q(l)(1),0≤l≤s.In this paper, we consider the optimal degree reduction with geometric continuity. An equivalent definition of geometric continuity can be described as follows.Lemma 2[3]The curvesP(t)andQ(t)preserveGr- andGs-continuity at endpoints respectively if and only if there exists a parametric transformationϕ(t), satisfyingϕ′(0)≠0,ϕ′(1)≠0, such that(5)(diP(t)/dti)|t=0=(diQ(ϕ(t))/dti)|t=0,i=0,1,…,r,(6)(djP(t)/dtj)|t=1=(djQ(ϕ(t))/dtj)|t=1,j=0,1,…,s.By Lemma 2, we know that geometric constraints can provide additional parameters to optimize the shape of the degree-reduced curve.In this subsection, we give the optimal degree reduction with parametric continuity and the approximation error. Zhou and Wang introduced a new framework for multi-degree reduction of Bézier curves with parametric continuity and obtained the optimal approximation inL2-norm  [16]. Their approximation error formula is correct. But its representation may confuse the readers because of its dimension expression. Thus, in order to make this paper self-contained and readable, we present the details of optimal degree reduction with parametric continuity as follows.Firstly, denotePn=(XnYn)=(p0,…,pn)2×(n+1),Qm=(X̄mȲm)=(q0,…,qm)2×(m+1),Q̃m=(q0,…,qr,0,…,0,qm−s,…,qm)2×(m+1),Qˆm=(qr+1,qr+2,…,qm−s−1)2×(m−s−r−1).Based on (3) and (4), it is easy to know that  [3](q0,q1,…,qr)=(p0,p1,…,pr)R(r+1)×(r+1),(qm−s,qm−s−1,…,qm)=(pn−s,pn−s+1,…,pn)S(s+1)×(s+1),whereR(r+1)×(r+1)=(l0,0l0,1⋯l0,r0l1,1⋯l1,r⋮⋮⋱⋮00⋯lr,r)−1,S(s+1)×(s+1)=(lm−s,n−s0⋯0lm−s+1,n−slm−s+1,n−s+1⋯0⋮⋮⋱⋮lm,n−slm,n−s+1⋯lm,n)−1,li,j=(mi)(n−mj−i)/(nj).Let(7)which contains the constraints (3) and (4).The following result presents the optimal degree reduction of Bézier curves with parametric continuity.Theorem 1[16]With constraint conditions   (3) and (4), the control points of the best(n−m)-degree reduced Bézier curves can be explicitly expressed as the following matrix formQ̃m=PnH,(Qˆm)T=N(A−BHT)(Pn)T,where(AA1)=(A(m+1)×(n+1)(A1)(n−m)×(n+1))=A(n+1)×(n+1)n=(ai,kn)(n+1)×(n+1),ai,kn=2k+1n+k+1(ni)∑l=0k(−1)k+l(kl)(kk−l)(n+ki+l),(F1,F,F2)=(F(m+1)×(r+1)1,F(m+1)×(m−r−s−1),F(m+1)×(s+1)2)=A(m+1)×(m+1)m=B,N=(FTVF)−1FTV,V=(vi,j)(m+1)×(m+1),vi,j={22i+1,i=j;0,i≠j.i,j=0,1,…,m.In this section, we aim to find the relation of the free parameters provided by geometric continuity using the least square method, and then simplify the nonlinear optimization problem. We consider two kinds of geometric continuity. One is keepingG2-continuity at one endpoint, and keepingG1-continuity orCk-continuity at another endpoint, respectively. We call this constraintG2&G1-continuity orG2&Ck-continuity, respectively. The other one is satisfyingG2-continuity at both endpoints. We call itG2&G2-continuity.When the constraints is geometric continuity, we also construct a matrixHsimilar to (7), such that(q0,…,qr,0,…,0,qm−s,…,qm)=(p0,…,pn)H.We call the matrixHconstrained matrix, which illustrates the constraint information.Note that onlyHin (8) contains the free parameters, which are provided by the given geometric continuity. The termsXn(A1)TKA1(Xn)TandYn(A1)TKA1(Yn)Tin (8) are constant, which are independent of constraints. So we remove the two terms from (8). Based on (2) and (8), we denote a simpler objective function(9)ε̃=Xn(AT−HBT)M(A−BHT)(Xn)T+Yn(AT−HBT)M(A−BHT)(Yn)T=XnATMA(Xn)T−2XnATMB(XnH)T+XnHBTMB(XnH)T+YnATMA(Yn)T−2YnATMB(YnH)T+YnHBTMB(YnH)T.Now our aim is to find the constrained matrixHby determining the free parameters, so thatε̃is minimized. Minimizingε̃is equivalent to finding the optimal degree-reduced curves, which is an unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem.According to Lemma 2, the degree-reduced curvesQ(t)satisfiesG2-continuity att=0andG1-continuity att=1respectively if and only ifQ(0)=P(0),Q(1)=P(1),Q′(0)=ϕ′(0)P′(0),Q′(1)=ϕ′(1)P′(1),Q″(0)=P″(ϕ(t))|t=0=(ϕ′(0))2P″(0)+ϕ″(0)P′(0).Letϕ′(0)=λ,ϕ′(1)=ηandϕ″(0)=α. ThenG2&G1-continuity is equivalent to the following equations.(10)q0=p0,(11)qm=pn,(12)q1=p0+λnmΔp0,(13)qm−1=pn−ηnmΔpn−1,(14)q2=p0+λ2nmΔp0+λ2n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2p0+αnm(m−1)Δp0,whereλ,ηandαare free parameters which can be used to optimize the shape of the degree-reduced curve. Now we use these additional parameters as further variables for optimization to reduce the approximation error.In terms ofG2&G1-continuity, the constrained matrix(15)andPnH=(XnHYnH)=(p0,p0+λnmΔp0,p0+λ2nmΔp0+λ2n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2p0+αnm(m−1)Δp0,0,…,0,pn−ηnmΔpn−1,pn)2×(m+1).The objective functionε̃in (9) is actually a quartic function of the three variablesλ,ηandα. Ifε̃is minimal, then the derivatives ofε̃with respect to these three variables are zero, i.e.,(16)∂ε̃∂α=−2XnATMBWx+2XnHBTMBWx−2YnATMBWy+2YnHBTMBWy=0,(17)∂ε̃∂λ=−2XnATMBUx+2XnHBTMBUx−2YnATMBUy+2YnHBTMBUy=0,(18)∂ε̃∂η=−2XnATMBUˆx+2XnHBTMBUˆx−2YnATMBUˆy+2YnHBTMBUˆy=0,whereWδ=(01×2,nm(m−1)Δδ0,01×(m−2))T,Uδ=(0,nmΔδ0,2nmΔδ0+2λn(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2δ0,01×(m−2))T,Uˆδ=(01×(m−1),−nmΔδn−1,0)T,δ=x,y.To write these equations in explicit form, we denoteBTMB=(bi,j)(m+1)×(m+1),Ĩj=ATMB(01×j,1,01×(m−j))T,ci,jk,l=Δkxi⋅Δlxj+Δkyi⋅Δlyj,di,j=bi,jnm(m−1),ti,j=−nmbi,j,ei,j,k=nm(bi,k+2bj,k),gi,j,k,l=bi,l+bj,l+bk,l,hi,jk=(ΔkxiXn+ΔkyiYn)Ĩj.Then according to (16) and (18), we have the following two quadratic equations:(19)λ2fˆ1+λfˆ2+fˆ3+αfˆ4+ηfˆ5=0,(20)λ2gˆ1+λgˆ2+gˆ3+αgˆ4+ηgˆ5=0,wherefˆ1=(n−1)d2,2c0,01,2,fˆ2=e1,2,2c0,01,1,fˆ3=g0,1,2,2c0,01,0+(bm−1,2+bm,2)c0,n1,0−h0,21,fˆ4=d2,2c0,01,1,fˆ5=tm−1,2c0,n−11,1;gˆ1=(n−1)d2,m−1cn−1,01,2,gˆ2=e1,2,m−1cn−1,01,1,gˆ3=g0,1,2,m−1cn−1,01,0+(bm−1,m−1+bm,m−1)cn−1,n1,0−hn−1,m−11,gˆ4=d2,m−1cn−1,01,1,gˆ5=tm−1,m−1cn−1,n−11,1.SinceBTMB=(bi,j)(m+1)×(m+1)is a positive definite matrix,(b2,2bm−1,2b2,m−1bm−1,m−1)is positive definite. On the other hand,(c0,01,1c0,n−11,1cn−1,01,1cn−1,n−11,1)is also positive definite whenp1≠p0andpn≠pn−1. So the determinant|fˆ4fˆ5gˆ4gˆ5|of the coefficient matrix of the Eqs. (19) and (20) is nonzero. By (19) and (20), we get(21)α=aˆ1λ2+aˆ2λ+aˆ3,(22)η=bˆ1λ2+bˆ2λ+bˆ3,whereaˆi=−|fˆifˆ5gˆigˆ5||fˆ4fˆ5gˆ4gˆ5|,bˆi=−|fˆ4fˆigˆ4gˆi||fˆ4fˆ5gˆ4gˆ5|,i=1,2,…,3.We derive the following cubic equation on the variableλby (17), (21) and (22):(23)cˆ1λ3+cˆ2λ2+cˆ3λ+cˆ4=0,wherecˆ1=2n−1m−1[(n−1)d2,2c0,02,2+aˆ1d2,2c0,02,1+bˆ1tm−1,2c0,n−12,1],cˆ2=(n−1)d2,1c0,01,2+aˆ1d2,1c0,01,1+bˆ1tm−1,1c0,n−11,1+2n−1m−1[e1,2,2c0,02,1+aˆ2d2,2c0,02,1+bˆ2tm−1,2c0,n−12,1],cˆ3=e1,2,1c0,01,1+aˆ2d2,1c0,01,1+bˆ2tm−1,1c0,n−11,1+2n−1m−1[aˆ3d2,2c0,02,1+bˆ3tm−1,2c0,n−12,1+g0,1,2,2c0,02,0+(bm−1,2+bm,2)c0,n2,0−h0,22],cˆ4=aˆ3d2,1c0,01,1+bˆ3tm−1,1c0,n−11,1+g0,1,2,1c0,01,0+(bm−1,1+bm,1)c0,n1,0−h0,11.Since cubic equations have analytic solution, we can easily find all real roots of (23) and choose one of them such that the objective functionε̃is minimal. Once the three variables are explicitly derived, the constrained matrixHis determined. Then we use Theorem 1 to find the control points of the optimal degree-reduced curve and the approximation error in explicit form.We now summarize the algorithm for degree reduction withG2&G1-continuity as follows.Algorithm 1.Input:piOutput:qi,ε1. Find the real roots of (23) and choose one of them such that the objective functionε̃is minimal.2. Computeαandηby (21) and (22), respectively.3. Compute the constrained matrixHby (15).4. Computeqiandεby Theorem 1 and (8), respectively.Remark 1If the constraint isG2&Cs-continuity, we just need to construct constrained matrix(24)The objective functionε̃contains two variablesλandα. Whens=2, let the derivatives ofε̃with respect to these two variables be zero. It follows thatλ2f̄1+λf̄2+αf̄3+f̄4=0,λ3ḡ1+λ2ḡ2+λαḡ3+αḡ4+λḡ5+ḡ6=0,wheref̄1=fˆ1,f̄2=fˆ2,f̄3=d2,2c0,01,1,f̄4=g0,1,2,2c0,01,1+gm−2,m−1,m,2c0,n1,0−em−1,m−2,2c0,n−11,1+(n−1)dm−2,2c0,n−21,2−h0,21,ḡ1=2(n−1)2m−1d2,2c0,02,2,ḡ2=2n−1m−1e1,2,2c0,01,2+(n−1)d2,1c0,01,2,ḡ3=2n−1m−1d2,2c0,01,2,ḡ4=d2,1c0,01,1,ḡ5=2n−1m−1(g0,1,2,2c0,00,2+gm−2,m−1,m,2cn,00,2−em−1,m−2,2cn−1,01,2+(n−1)dm−2,2cn−2,02,2−h0,22)+e1,2,1c0,01,1,ḡ6=g0,1,2,1c0,00,1+gm−2,m−1,m,1cn,00,1−em−1,m−2,1cn−1,01,1+(n−1)dm−2,1cn−2,02,1−h0,11.Note that these two equations can be converted into a cubic equation on the variableλ. Similar to Algorithm 1, we can derive the optimal degree-reduced curve in explicit form.Remark 2If (10)–(13) hold, the constraint isG1&G1-continuity. The objective functionε̃is actually a bivariate function of two variablesλandη. By solving a simple system of linear equations, we obtained the optimal solution for minimizingε̃in explicit form  [17].Remark 3The constraint used in  [18,19] satisfiesC1-continuity in addition toG2-continuity at two endpoints. We call this constraintC1/G2-continuity. That meansλ=1andη=1, whileαandβare the free parameters. We construct the constrained matrixHsuch that(25)PnH=(p0,p0+nmΔp0,p0+2nmΔp0+n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2p0+αnm(m−1)Δp0,0,…,0,pn−2nmΔpn−1+n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2pn−2+βnm(m−1)Δpn−1,pn−nmΔpn−1,pn)2×(m+1).The objective functionε̃contains two variablesαandβ. Let the derivatives ofε̃with respect to these two variables be zero. It follows thatαf̆1+βf̆2+f̆3=0,αğ1+βğ2+ğ3=0,wheref̆1=d2,2c0,01,1,f̆2=dm−2,2c0,n−11,1,f̆3=g0,1,2,2c0,01,0+gm−2,m−1,m,2c0,n1,0+e1,2,2c0,01,1−em−1,m−2,2c0,n−11,1+(n−1)(d2,2c0,01,2+dm−2,2c0,n−21,2)ğ1=d2,m−2cn−1,01,1,ğ2=dm−2,m−2cn−1,n−11,1,ğ3=g0,1,2,m−2cn−1,01,0+gm−2,m−1,m,m−2cn−1,n1,0+e1,2,m−2cn−1,01,1−em−1,m−2,m−2cn−1,n−11,1+(n−1)(d2,m−2cn−1,01,2+dm−2,m−2cn−1,n−21,2).By solving the system of linear equations, we get the optimal solution for minimizingε̃in explicit form.By Lemma 2, the degree-reduced curveQ(t)preservesG2-continuity at two endpoints if and only if the Eqs. (10)–(14) hold andQ″(1)=P″(ϕ(t))|t=1=(ϕ′(1))2P″(0)+ϕ″(1)P′(0).Letϕ″(1)=β, then we have(26)qm−2=pn−η2nmΔpn−1+η2n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2pn−2+βnm(m−1)Δpn−1.Then we construct the constrained matrixHsuch that(27)PnH=(XnHYnH)=(p0,p0+λnmΔp0,p0+λ2nmΔp0+λ2n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2p0+αnm(m−1)Δp0,0,…,0,pn−η2nmΔpn−1+η2n(n−1)m(m−1)Δ2pn−2+βnm(m−1)Δpn−1,pn−ηnmΔpn−1,pn)2×(m+1).Now the objective functionε̃is a quartic function of the four variablesλ,η,αandβ. Let the derivatives ofε̃with respect to the two variablesαandβbe zero. We get (16) besides the following equation:(28)∂ε̃∂β=−2XnATMBW̄x+2XnHBTMBW̄x−2YnATMBW̄y+2YnHBTMBW̄y=0,whereW̄δ=(01×(m−2),nm(m−1)Δδn−1,01×2)T,δ=x,y.From (16) and (28), we getλ2f̃1+λf̃2+η2f̃3+ηf̃4+f̃5+αf̃6+βf̃7=0,λ2g̃1+λg̃2+η2g̃3+ηg̃4+g̃5+αg̃6+βg̃7=0,wheref̃1=(n−1)d2,2c0,01,2,f̃2=e1,2,2c0,01,1,f̃3=(n−1)dm−2,2c0,n−21,2,f̃4=−em−1,m−2,2c0,n−11,1,f̃5=g0,1,2,2c0,01,0+gm−2,m−1,m,2c0,n1,0−h0,21,f̃6=d2,2c0,01,1,f̃7=dm−2,2c0,n−11,1,g̃1=(n−1)d2,m−2cn−1,01,2,g̃2=e1,2,m−2cn−1,01,1,g̃3=(n−1)dm−2,m−2cn−1,n−21,2,g̃4=−em−1,m−2,m−2cn−1,n−11,1,g̃5=g0,1,2,m−2cn−1,01,0+gm−2,m−1,m,m−2cn−1,n1,0−hn−1,m−21,g̃6=d2,m−2cn−1,01,1,g̃7=dm−2,m−2cn−1,n−11,1.Since the matrices(d2,2dm−2,2d2,m−2dm−2,m−2)and(c0,01,1c0,n−11,1cn−1,01,1cn−1,n−11,1)are positive definite, the determinant|f̃6f̃7g̃6g̃7|≠0. It follows that(29)α=a1λ2+a2λ+a3η2+a4η+a5,(30)β=b1λ2+b2λ+b3η2+b4η+b5,whereai=−|f̃if̃7g̃ig̃7||f̃6f̃7g̃6g̃7|,bi=−|f̃6f̃ig̃6g̃i||f̃6f̃7g̃6g̃7|,i=1,2,…,5.Substituting (29) and (30) in objective functionε̃, we get a quartic function of the two variablesλandη. Fig. 1illustrates how to create the new quartic objective function.This minimization of the new objective function can be accomplished by many numerical methods, such as the conjugate gradient method. And a “good” initial guess is to setλ=1andη=1, which is exactly the condition ofC1-continuity. After obtaining the optimal numerical valueλandη, we substitute them into (29) and (30), and then derive the corresponding constrained matrixH. By Theorem 1, we get the control points of the best degree-reduced curve and its approximation error.This section is devoted to presenting several examples, which are extracted from previous Refs.  [17,19]. The following examples show that our method produces a consistently better approximation effect compared with the existing known methods.Example 1We consider a planar Bézier curve of degree 10 with control points given by (0, 1.2), (0.04, 0.6), (0.15, 0.51), (0.32, 0.88), (0.31, 0.09), (0.52, 0), (0.62, 0.8), (0.89, 0.87), (0.92, 0.6), (0.92, 0.3), (0.75, 0). We aim to find a Bézier curve of degree 6 to approximate it with various geometric continuity.(a)When the constraint isG1&G1-continuity, as shown in Remark 2, we get the following two bivariate linear equations:1139λ+433168η−10074979680680=0,4337λ+118912η−47248979340340=0.It follows thatλ=1.0223andη=0.7629. The approximation errorε=0.0080. (See Fig. 2(a).)When the constraint isG2&G1-continuity, we get the following univariate cubic equation by (23):976573265λ3−259890932λ2+604626368966λ−25890298489599243100=0.It follows thatλ=1.0656. After replacing the solution in (21) and (22), we getη=0.7843andα=−2.4585. Now, the approximation errorε=0.0102. (See Fig. 2(b).)When the constraint isG1&G2-continuity, we can similarly getλ=0.9300,η=1.0569andβ=−2.8492. The approximation error is 0.0152. (See Fig. 2(c).)When the constraint condition isG2/G2-continuity, from (29) and (30), we haveα=7893423911306348λ2−546283462826587λ−76308755653174η2+36038592826587η+28210058817924987029080,β=−46683002826587λ2−109600962826587λ−101532332826587η2+546283462826587η−837290897976246757270.After replacing them in (9), the objective function forms a bivariate quartic polynomial:54254073886557125λ4−320853155462285λ3+11550722079220812513404375λ2−60669223359735367669837500λ+881739310924570η4+419577248739656η3−5574512291315915451426875η2−155077906168211110000714900000η+361497844136029499375λη−766479155462285λη2+61673433109245700λ2η+25837111088235995λ2η2+8443831245896802667350793525929847000000.By minimizing the above function, we getλ=0.9752andη=1.1379. After replacing them in (29) and (30), we haveα=−1.2152andβ=−1.4145. The approximation error is 0.0177. (See Fig. 2(d).)When the constraint condition isG2&C2-continuity, as shown in Remark 1, we have two equations of two variables as follows:−485626732042040000+1132750λ−37922000λ2+11349500α=0,−17307907386750000+5888654814084080000λ−3792500λ2+22661875α+4778800λ3−37955000λα=0.We getλ=0.8228andα=0.7160explicitly by using the elimination method. The approximation error is 0.0318. (See Fig. 2(e).)When the constraint condition isC1/G2-continuity at two endpoints as shown in Remark 3, from (25), we can construct the constrained matrixHand get the following linear equations:15257618800+113165α−4331848β=0,6199273154700−43321α+118960β=0.It follows thatα=−1.1302andβ=−3.1982. The approximation error is 0.0223. (See Fig. 2(f).)We summarize the approximation errors in Table 1. Obviously, the approximation error withG1&G1-continuity is smallest. And the approximation error withG2&C2-continuity is largest. Table 1 shows that degree reduction with geometric continuity has a smaller approximation error than that with parametric continuity.Example 2Also Example 2 in  [19]Given a spiral curve of degree 19, we show the results of degree-reducing it to a degree 8 curve in Fig. 3(a). We compare ourG2-continuity method (red dotted–dashed) withC1&G2-continuity method (blue long-dashed) in  [19]. The approximation error is 0.3665 compared with 0.7213 in  [19]. Fig. 3(b) is a plot of the distance curve‖P(t)−Q(t)‖.Example 3Also Example 3 in  [19]We compare ourG2-continuity method (red dotted–dashed) withC1&G2-continuity method (blue long-dashed) in  [19]. The approximation error is 0.5027 compared with 0.7747 in  [19]. Fig. 4(a) shows the degree reduction of the double loop curve from degree 13 to degree 8, and Fig. 4(b) shows the corresponding error distance curves.Example 4Also Example 3 in  [19]We compare ourG2-continuity method (red dotted–dashed) withC1&G2-continuity method (blue long-dashed) in  [19]. The approximation error is 0.3573 compared with 0.6358 in  [19]. Fig. 5(a) shows the degree reduction of the heart curve from degree 13 to degree 8, and Fig. 5(b) shows the corresponding error distance curves.For simplicity, we refer to ZWY as our method, LW as the method in  [15] and RM as the method in  [19]. Since LW and RM did not consider the constraints ofG2&G1andG2&Cr, we just compare the three methods with the constraint ofG2&G2with respect to the approximation errors, the computation costs and the running time. We carry out the mentioned methods through MATLAB on a PC with Intel (R) Pentium (R) Dual CPU (1.6 GHz) with 2 GB of RAM.Rababah and Mann solved their minimization problem by linear methods, and Lu and Wang solved their nonlinear minimization problem by the conjugate gradient method. We also use conjugate gradient method because the gradient information can be easily calculated from the objective function. A “good” initial guess is to setλ=η=1, which is exactly the condition ofC1-continuity.Table 2shows the comparison of the three methods in terms of the approximation errors and the running time. Results show that although RM is fastest in terms of the running time, its approximation is not optimal. And although the approximation of LW is as good as that of ZWY, its running time is more than ZWY’s. ZWY achieves a good balance between the approximation errors and the running time. In particular, numerical experiments indicate that the running time of ZWY is satisfying.Table 3shows the comparison between ZWY and LW in terms of computational efficiency. They are accomplished using the conjugate gradient method, which usually involves a number of iterations. In Table 3, Gr is a given iteration accuracy.pis the number of floating point, which is counted by determining the four parametersλ,η,αandβ. Table 3 shows that ZWY has faster convergence rate than LW. Moreover, ZWY has a significant advantage in the running time and the computation costs.For simplicity, the Bézier curves are assumed to be 2D in this paper. When the given Bézier curves are 3D, we can construct an objective function similar to (9) with the method of  [17]. So our method of this paper can also be applied to 3D Bézier curves inL2-norm.In this paper, we mainly deal with the constraints ofG2&G1,G2&CrandG2&G2. We simplify the nonlinear optimization problem by finding the relation of the free parameters, which are given by geometric continuity. When the constraint containsGk-continuity (k≥3), the objective function becomes more complicated. But our method is also useful in this case. With aid of MATLAB, we can use the least square method to clarify the relation of the numerous free parameters, and then simplify the objective function.
