@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The number of applications for RFID systems is growing rapidly. Due to the conflict between large-scale use of RFID technology and inadequate security-related research, this paper proposes secure mechanisms based on tripartite credibility consisting of an enhanced security mechanism of LLRP and a tag participation third-party authentication mechanism. This paper first introduces relevant information about RFID systems and then details design and implementation of the proposed secure mechanisms. Finally, this paper evaluates the performance of the proposed mechanisms in terms of storage complexity, communication cost and computational cost and analyzes the security advantages compared to those of previous research.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a non-contact automatic identification technology that identifies targets to obtain relevant data using radio frequency signals without manual intervention in a variety of harsh environments [1]. Compared with other means of identification, RFID can identify multiple targets, moving targets and long-range targets. It has the advantages of robustness against moisture, dust and smoke. Currently, with the development of modern electronic technology, the emergence of low-power miniaturized chips promotes the rapid development of RFID applications [2]. RFID technology is now involved in all aspects of daily life, being widely used in various fields including production, manufacturing, retail, logistics, transportation, medical, inventory control and asset management to improve management efficiency [3].In general, an RFID system consists of the tag, the reader, and the client. The tag, which is placed on the target, has a certain storage and computation capacity. As the tag stores the identity and special information of targets, it is the real data carrier in the RFID system. The reader exchanges data with the tag using a radio frequency signal. The essential function of the reader is to provide a means for data transmission with the tag. In addition, it offers some fairly complex functions, including signal state control, parity error checking and correction [4]. The client is simply accepted as a database system that is mainly used for storage, information processing and management of the RFID system. Generally, the client replies to queries from the reader through wired or wireless channel transmission.EPCglobal is an RFID standard research institution jointly organized by UCC and EAN, and it has excellent speed, depth and breadth in setting global RFID standards [5]. Since its earliest days, EPCglobal has been committed to establishing a set of neutral, open and transparent global standards. EPCglobals goal is to solve the transparency and traceability of the supply chain [6]. Transparency and traceability mean that in the supply chain, all partners can understand the information on each individual item, including location, production date and so on. Low Level Reader Protocol (LLRP) is a protocol interface standard recently set by EPCglobal as the communication standard between RFID readers and clients [7].LLRP is called low-level because it provides control of RFID air protocol operation timing and access to air protocol command parameters [8]. LLRP provides the formats and procedures of communication between a Client and a Reader, whose minimum unit is called messages [9]. Clients send messages including requests for capability discovery, device configuration, access operations, and inventory management to readers. Similarly, readers send messages such as the results of RF surveys, acknowledgements, access and inventory operation results to clients [10]. There is no mechanism for retransmission or re-request because LLRP is an application layer protocol. Consequently, maintaining the consistency of the readers status recorded by clients and real status is a prerequisite for the system to work properly.As RFID technology is applied in more fields, the expectations for RFIDs development become higher [11]. RFID technology is currently in a rapidly rising period, and the technology is widely recognized to be one of the most promising application technologies of this century. Furthermore, a number of countries attach importance to RFID technology, hoping to develop it into a significant industry [12]. It is worth mentioning that Cisco predicts the global manufacturing sector will have 13.5 billion assets to apply to Internet of Things applications by 2022. The development of RFID technology has been in progress for more than 50 years, and the variety of RFID products will become increasingly diverse with advancing technology [13]. Therefore, the development of RFID technology will lead to new progress in a variety of areas such as the tag, the reader, application systems integration, middleware platform, and standardization.Because the designers did not consider the security issues of RFID systems at the beginning, phenomena such as malicious tag damage, smart card copying, and mobile payment terminal impersonation appear frequently [14]. In particular, the leakage of military information and commercial secrets from RFID systems may cause serious consequences. RFID system security issues must be addressed urgently because security has become the bottleneck restricting the development of RFID technology [15]. The data exchange between the reader and the tag is carried over insecure wireless channels. Accordingly, attackers can easily intercept data exchange information to counterfeit the identity of communicating parties. There are also some security threats in LLRP, which is used between the reader and the client. For instance, the lack of sender authentication may cause security threats, and version negotiation error leads to interaction failure. This article improves the RFID security mechanism to address some of these security issues [16].
