@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Complex applications such as big data analytics involve different forms of coupling relationships that reflect interactions between factors related to technical, business (domain-specific) and environmental (including socio-cultural and economic) aspects. There are diverse forms of couplings embedded in poor-structured and ill-structured data. Such couplings are ubiquitous, implicit and/or explicit, objective and/or subjective, heterogeneous and/or homogeneous, presenting complexities to existing learning systems in statistics, mathematics and computer sciences, such as typical dependency, association and correlation relationships. Modeling and learning such couplings thus is fundamental but challenging. This paper discusses the concept of coupling learning, focusing on the involvement of coupling relationships in learning systems. Coupling learning has great potential for building a deep understanding of the essence of business problems and handling challenges that have not been addressed well by existing learning theories and tools. This argument is verified by several case studies on coupling learning, including handling coupling in recommender systems, incorporating couplings into coupled clustering, coupling document clustering, coupled recommender algorithms and coupled behavior analysis for groups.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Complex interactive and unstructured/semi-structured data and applications, especially in big data, present major challenges to the current analytic and learning theories and systems. Big data, in particular, presents specific complexities of weakly structured and unstructured data distribution, dynamics, interactions, and structures, which challenge the existing theoretical and commercial systems in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Examples include the connections between gene combinations and physical and psychological consequences, between one’s personal traits or preferences in social media and one’s social, behavioral, attitudinal and interest attributes.This results in a situation where learning big data is analogous to the ancient Indian parable of seven blind men encountering an elephant for the first time. Each touches a different part of the animal, so when the seven share their experiences, each has a completely different idea of what the whole animal must look like. Similarly, when confronted with a big data set, a data modeler or learner may only see a partial set or aspect, hence often only a partial story is told by a learner. Why does this happen? There are many reasons, one of which is the invisibility of sophisticated coupling relationships (coupling for short, see Definition 2.1) hidden between the heterogeneous parts that are ‘visible’ to blind people. They do not have the ability to recognize the visible and invisible couplings between parts to connect those heterogeneous parts to form a global picture as sighted people do. This is representative of certain major challenges of complex relations hidden in complex data (particularly referring here to data with complex couplings and/or mixed distributions, formats, types and variables, and unstructured and weakly structured data). Learning visible and especially invisible coupling relationships can complement and assist in understanding weakly structured and unstructured data.In many cases, such inherent, locally visible but globally invisible (or vice versa) couplings are presented in a range of forms, structures, and layers and on diverse entities. Often individual learners cannot tell the whole story due to their inability to identify to such complex coupling. Effectively learning the widespread, various, visible and invisible couplings is thus crucial for obtaining a true and total picture of the underlying problem.This is not a trivial task, however. The difficulty in learning complex couplings lies not only with invisible couplings – even visible couplings are often overlooked. Taking the design of recommender algorithms as an example, our ability to recognize them is limited, even though these interactions and structures are embedded in applications such as social media networks. For example, there have been several recent cases in which researchers have started to incorporate inherent couplings between items and between users into a recommender system (RS) (Jannach et al., 2010; Ricci, Rokach, Shapira, & Kantor, 2011), after a long period of focusing on rating-based exploration, whereas the item-item couplings and user-user couplings (see Fig. 2) have been always intrinsic to the systems.One reason for this is that visibility is relative to opportunity and capability. The same couplings are implicit to some people, while explicit to others. For instance, in social media recommendation, the friendship between twitters (Cheng) has only recently been recognized as enhancing social recommendation, yet it has always been a natural built-in feature of social media systems. There is a need to develop our ability to capture and convert as many invisible couplings as possible to visible coupling, and to effectively capture visible couplings in complex data.In reviewing the existing literature, we unfortunately cannot find systematic methodologies and techniques in learning theories to address the above coupling issues. This raises a fundamental question: how much do we know about coupling? and many other basic questions, including: what are couplings, where they are, and in what forms are they present, which we need to address before we can think about how to capture and embed couplings in learning systems. Once these problems have been satisfactorily addressed, more issues follow, such as: how to represent couplings, how to test whether and to what extent couplings exist in a dataset, how to incorporate them into learning models, and how to evaluate the difference they make once they are incorporated into learning systems. These challenges form the basis of the need to study coupling learning, a fundamental but undeveloped area in computer science, to address the intricate coupling relationships embedded in complex data and increasingly seen in information retrieval, data mining and machine learning in particular. This is crucial for big data analytics because most existing analytics and learning theories and systems have been built on the assumption that data is independent and identically distributed (IID), while big data is essentially non-IID (Cao, 2013b). Coupling is one critical aspect of non-IIDness (Cao, 2013b) (the other is heterogeneity or so-called personalization, which is not the main concern in this paper, although coupling may be heterogeneous and involve heterogeneity in data).Learning the above characteristics of complex couplings in big data fundamentally challenges existing learning theories and systems, including pairwise coupling (Moreira & Mayoraz, 1998; Wu et al., 2004), statistical relation learning (Dzeroski & Lavra, 2001; Getoor & Taskar, 2007), dependency learning (Neville & Jensen, 2007; Yin, Li, & Cao, 2014), association learning (Ceglar & Roddick, 2006; Lu, Feng, & Han, 2000), correlation analysis (Hair, Black, & Babin, 2009; Székely, Rizzo, Nail, & Bakirov, 2007), linkage analysis (Faloutsos, Han, & Yu, 2011; Miller, Griffiths, & Jordan, 2009), community analysis (Arenas, Danon, Dıaz-Guilera, Gleiser, & Guimera, 2004; Girvan & Newman, 2002), social network analysis (Arenas et al., 2004; Girvan & Newman, 2002; Knoke & Yang, 2007; Wasserman & Faust, 1994), multivariate time series (Székely et al., 2007), causality analysis (Gujarati & Porter, 2009) and graph analysis (Cook & Holder, 2006). They either essentially treat data as IID or only address specific forms or levels of couplings. No general and competent theories, frameworks, algorithms or tools are available to handle the coupling complexities discussed above.The above observations motivate this work, namely to systematically state the coupling learning problem, which clearly involves interactive, unstructured and semi-structured data. The aim of this paper is multi-fold:•High-level: build a conceptual system of coupling learning (Sections 2–4) towards a generic and comprehensive understanding of the broad-based coupling relationships that exist in complex data and applications (especially in big data related business).Middle-level: illustrate how to advance classic problems to another generation by incorporating coupling learning into a specific existing scientific problem such as recommender systems (Section 5).Low-level: showcase specific examples in recommender systems to demonstrate how couplings can be managed in practice to improve analytic outcomes (Section 6).The purpose of this paper is therefore not to specify one particular technique for learning a particular type of coupling (instead we provide citations to our related work for such discrete discussions), but to disclose the whole nature of the problem and build generic frameworks and examples to show possible ways to address the problem.Accordingly, the organization of this work is as follows. Section 2 discusses the concept of coupling and major coupling relationships often addressed in current big data communities. Section 3 presents a high-level picture of coupling layers and forms appearing in complex data and applications. In Section 4, the issues of modeling and measuring couplings and the curse of couplings are introduced. An example of comprehensive couplings in recommender systems is discussed in Section 5, which presents a new theoretical framework for next-generation recommender systems. Two case studies are given in Section 6, one in which a coupled K-mode algorithm to identify items with strong coupling relationships is presented, and one in which couplings are utilized to improve Matrix Factorization-based recommendation. Section 7 explores the opportunities for learning couplings in data mining, text mining, information retrieval, and complex behavior analysis. The paper is concluded in Section 8.In this section, we discuss the concept of coupling, and the relevant work in statistics, mathematics and computer science. The following key concepts are used in this paper:•Coupling: refers to any relationship or interaction that connects two or more aspects (which could be between inputs or between inputs and outputs).Aspect: a term broadly referring to entity, entity property (or characteristics such as variations), property value, context, learner or analytic model, learning objective (effect), or learned results (such as patterns and clusters), etc. Typically, an aspect refers to either an antecedent or a postcedent, or to either a cause or an effect.Entity: refers to elements such as profile (configuration), object class (category), object, instance, etc. on which learning is applied; in a practical problem such as recommender systems, entity is instantiated to respective elements, such as user, item, and rating.Context: refers to the surrounding environment and environmental elements.Property: refers to the characteristics of an entity and is interchangeable with attribute and variable.Interaction: broadly refers to invisible or visible connections that exist between two or more entities.Intra-coupling: refers to the coupling within an aspect, such as the relationship between the values of a property.Inter-coupling: refers to coupling between aspects, such as between properties.Coupling layer: refers to where the coupling lodges, such as entity, property, context, interaction and learning.Coupling form: refers to the way in which coupling is presented, in terms of specific presentations, configurations, profiles, structures, types, and/or variations of coupling.Coupling strength: refers to the extent to which the connected aspects are bonded. Strengths may be represented in terms of frequency, similarity, dissimilarity, mutual information, probability, likelihood, effect (such as effectiveness, efficiency), business values (such as economic performance between financial variables) or other metrics. The strength of couplings between two bonded aspects is sensitive to the coherence (or compactness) of its constituent forms (configurations).Coupling is a very rich concept, related to many aspect as discussed before and below.Definition 2.1CouplingCoupling refers to any relationship (for instance, co-occurrence, neighborhood, dependency, linkage, correlation, or causality) between two or more aspects, such as object, object class, object property (variable), process, fact and state of affairs, or other types of entities or properties (such as learners and learned results) appearing or produced prior to, during and after a target process (such as a learning task).For example, different couplings exist between ratings for an item, items, item properties, users and user properties in a recommender system, as shown in Fig. 2 in Section 5.In a learning system, as shown in Fig. 1, couplings may exist within and/or between aspects, such as entity (objects, object class, instance, or group/community) and its/their properties (variables), context (environment) and its constraints, interactions (exchange of information, material or energy) between entities or between the entity and its/their environment, learning objectives (targets, such as risk level or fraud), the corresponding learning methods (models, algorithms or systems) and resultant outcomes (such as patterns or clusters).The process of learning couplings further requires the following perspectives to be considered: problem domain, data presentation (format), knowledge representation, and coupling characteristics.•From the problem domain perspective, coupling may present in terms of domain-specific, cross-domain, organizational, social, behavioral, cultural, or economic connections, depending on which specific areas a problem belongs to. For example, in the economic domain, different markets affect each other. Price movement in one stock market may be influenced by prices in other stock markets and other types of markets such as petrol prices, commodity prices, and exchange rates.On the data format side, coupling may appear in different forms corresponding to diverse data formats, including numerical, categorical, textual, graphic, image, or mixed-structured data. For instance, in Cao, Ou, and Yu (2012) and Wang et al. (2011) respectively, behavior coupling and categorical coupling between objects are discussed. From an even higher level perspective, coupling may exist between entity profiles (configurations), which may take the form of arrays, affinities, artworks, or networks.In terms of knowledge representation, coupling may be presented in terms of syntactic, semantic (ontological), graphic, or inferential specifications. For example, in Wang and Cao (2012) and Cao (2013a), different temporal logic-based, ontological and inferential couplings are discussed for coupled group behaviors. In a mathematical way, couplings may be presented as configurations, distributions, linkage, neighboring, co-occurrences, causality, correlations and dependence.Couplings may appear to have different characteristics: explicit (visible) vs. implicit (invisible), qualitative (e.g. social coupling) vs. quantitative (e.g. conditional dependency), descriptive analysis vs. deep analysis, specific (e.g. rating similarity in RS) vs. comprehensive (e.g. item and user-coupling similarity in RS), local (part) vs. global (body), certain (static) vs. uncertain (dynamic), and known (e.g. distance calculation) vs. unknown (latent relation), according to the characteristics of the aspects involved in a system. In addition to typical relationships such as correlations between two variables and causality between inputs and outputs, couplings may present characteristics of Simpson’s Paradox (Wardrop, 1995) or Granger Causality (Gujarati & Porter, 2009).The above discussions show that coupling as a concept covers, but is also much richer than, the existing terms including dependence (Neville & Jensen, 2007; Wei et al., 2014), correlation (Hair et al., 2009; Székely et al., 2007), and association (Ceglar & Roddick, 2006; Lu et al., 2000), and involves similarity learning (Pelillo, 2013). Classic research on dependence, correlation and association are much more specific, descriptive and explicit, often having specific meaning and ways of being measured. Similarity learning serves a fundamental purpose in object relation analysis. In this section, we review these typical coupling relationships which are mainly addressed in statistics, mathematics, and computer science.In statistics and mathematics, typical coupling relationships include association, correlation and dependence. Association refers to any relationship between two measured quantities that renders them statistically dependent (Upton & Cook, 2006). Correlation (Hair et al., 2009; Székely et al., 2007) is a concept with a narrower scope and more specific meaning, usually referring to a linear relationship between two quantities. Dependence (Neville & Jensen, 2007; Wei et al., 2014) refers to an even more specific statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data which do not satisfy a mathematical condition of probabilistic independence.Many statistical and mathematical measures have been proposed to quantify the extent of association, correlation and dependence. Examples of such measures include the product moment correlation coefficient, the odds ratio used for dichotomous measurements, the distance correlation, tetrachoric correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal’s lambda, and Tschuprow’s T and Cramer’s V. There are several correlation coefficients available for measuring the degree of correlation in very specific cases, such as Pearson correlation coefficient. Other correlation measures have been introduced to address their deficiency, such as distance correlation and Brownian correlation (Szekely & Rizzo, 2009; Székely et al., 2007), the correlation ratio to detect functional dependence, total correlation and dual total correlation to detect general dependence, multi-moment correlation measures, polychoric correlation for latent ordinal variables, and copula for connecting dependence between variables.Specific focus has been placed on correlation and linearity (Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988; Székely et al., 2007), and correlation and causality (Holland, 1986) in statistics and machine learning. Linear correlation, such as Pearson correlation coefficient and canonical correlation analysis, has been widely explored. Nonlinear relationships (Dietrich, 1991) and correlation with the variation of the correlation coefficient with time have been less explored but appear widely in real-world data and applications. The conventional dictum “correlation does not imply causation” indicates that the causes underlying correlation between variables may be direct (known) or indirect (unknown). Causality (causation) (Pearl, 2000) (such as Granger Causality (Gujarati & Porter, 2009)) indicates the reasons driving one event after another. Typical theory includes probabilistic causation which measures the likelihood of the cause triggering effect. However, couplings may go far beyond causality, such as implicit connections, indication or co-occurrences.The specific meanings of the mathematical/statistical terms association, correlation and dependence have been widened to satisfy needs in other domains. Typically, association is a common concept widely used in various fields of study, for example, astronomical associations between astronomical exposures, archeological associations between objects found together, chemical associations or dissociations between particles, ions or radicals, ecological associations composing species, genetic associations (linkage, or occurrences) of two or more traits in a population of individuals, and psychological associations showing connections between two or more concepts in the mind or imagination.In computer science, there is a long history of research on specific coupling relationships. In software engineering, coupling (grouping) is a concept widely accepted in computer programming which measures the degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other modules. There, coupling is usually contrasted with cohesion. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design (http://en.wikipedia.orgwikiCoupling_(computer_programming)). Different levels of couplings exist in a software system, from data, message, module to communication and control. Such software couplings do not involve analytic and learning tasks, thus they are not discussed in this paper.Researchers in the areas of information theory, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and image processing have specifically paid significant attention to similarity learning, which serves as a fundamental tool for measuring and analyzing object relationships. Many similarity measures have been proposed for different data presentations, which address object coupling in terms of major paradigms, including co-occurrence, coverage (overlapping), distance (difference or dissimilarity), causality and uncertainty. Most of the effort has focused on addressing strong (also explicit, high or tight) couplings or decouplings (independence) as a priority. Low (also implicit, loose or weak) couplings are often ignored to simplify the analytic complexity.Additional efforts have been made in information theory (Reza, 1994), fuzzy set theory (Klir, St. Clair, & Yuan, 1997; Masulli, Pasi, & Parenti, 2001) and statistical machine learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2011) to address uncertainty or possibility and build respective entropy theories (through entropy-based mutual information, for instance), fuzzy membership functions and probabilistic similarity. In recent years, latent relation analysis (Cao, 2013b; Cao et al., 2012; Dumais, 2005) has been increasingly picked up by the machine learning community, while the existing work still focuses on specific couplings, especially probabilistic relationships. There are very few studies on other types of couplings, which are more related to non-entity couplings (such as multi-source, method and feature couplings) and other types of entities or properties appearing or produced prior to, during and after a target process (such as a learning task). No systematic discussions can be found on coupling learning from the problem domain, data presentation, knowledge representation, and coupling characteristic perspectives.In this section, we expand the above discussions on couplings, aiming to provide an overall picture of couplings widespread in comprehensive learning tasks.As discussed in Section 2.1, the complexity of couplings is embodied through many aspects related to entity, property, context, interaction and learning in a learning system. Accordingly, we here discuss the couplings present in these five layers.•Entity coupling: An entity is the basic carrier of couplings. Couplings may exist within and/or between data sources, data objects, instances, properties, and values. Correspondingly, intra-coupling occurs within an entity, such as intra-attribute coupling (Wang et al., 2011), and inter-coupling appears between entities, for example, inter-attribute coupling (Wang et al., 2011). Couplings associated with different data presentations (different formats and types) of entities present in different forms. Couplings in numeric data (Wang, She, & Cao, 2013b) are very different from those in categorical data (Wang et al., 2011). Of the total number of entities involved, such as attributes, couplings include single entity-based couplings such as temporal coupling, and compound couplings (which involve multiple couplings organized in a certain way or structure) such as hierarchical coupling (for more about behavior combinations, refer to Cao et al. (2012) and Wang & Cao (2012) and for pattern relations, refer to Cao (2013a) and Cao, Zhang, Zhao, Luo, & Zhang (2011)).Property coupling: Property (attribute) coupling may take place in terms of entity property distribution, structure, semantics, logic, linkage or dynamics. Intra-property coupling refers to the coupling between the values of a property, such as age coupling. In addition, one property of an entity may more or less depend on, or influence, another property, which involves inter-property coupling between properties. For example, intra-term and inter-term coupling metrics are defined in Cheng, Miao, Wang, and Cao (2013) to disclose the semantic linkage between terms in document analysis, and intra- and inter-attribute coupling are discussed in Wang et al. (2011). In addition to the traditional focus on the coefficient between numerical variables, more work is needed to explore the interactions between heterogeneous properties, such as those found in multi-structured data.Context coupling: The context surrounding an underlying learning problem may be composed of aspects supporting or influencing entity properties, interactions and effect. This may include a mixture of varied factors in the broader context, from social, organizational, cultural, economic, and domain-specific aspects, besides the specific constraints surrounding entities and systems. In addition to this, entities interact with their context, and corresponding couplings also exist within and between these aspects. Capturing the couplings between entities and their contexts may occur through latent learning (see the discussions about user-item couplings in Fig. 2 in Section 5 (Cao, 2013b)).Interaction coupling: From the interaction channel perspective, couplings may take the form of dependence, correlation, association, matching, semantic similarity, co-occurrence, neighborhood, distance, density, uncertainty, logic relation, overlapping, networking or connection. In a complex application, such interactions may occur within and between system elements, subsystems, system and context.Learning coupling: Here, learning refers to the methods, objectives, tasks, levels, dimensions, processes, measures and learning outcomes associated with understanding a problem; accordingly, couplings exist within or between them. Typical examples include ensemble clustering (Wang, She, & Cao, 2013a) which considers couplings between clustering methods and within a clustering, and pattern combinations (Cao, 2013a; Cao et al., 2011; Cao, Zhao, & Zhang, 2008) which consider sub-patterns that are aggregated in terms of certain relations.Limited work can be found in the literature on handling the above aspects of couplings. Addressing each of the above aspects or specific elements within an aspect has the potential to not only upgrade existing theories but also create new theoretical breakthroughs.Couplings in complex data and applications may have different forms, configurations and structures, which are often mixed with each other. Such couplings may need to be explored from structural, semantic, probabilistic, mathematical, dynamic, graphical/image, and/or networking perspectives.Different forms of coupling relationships exist in complex applications such as behavioral and social systems (Cao, 2013b). Following our discussions about complex relations in complex behavioral systems in Wang and Cao (2012) and Cao (2013a), the following types of couplings may appear between the aspects discussed in Section 3.1. We highlight them because they are common and have been studied in several areas. In the example, we particularly illustrate such type of coupling that exists in behaviors within a social media system.•Serial coupling: There is a serial order between adjacent entities; for instance, one behavior happens after another, one item is purchased after another, or one comment in a blog triggers another comment on the same topic. Two common types of serial couplings are prefix couplings and postfix couplings, in which one entity connects to another in either a prefix or postfix way. Serial coupling is particularly explored in sequence analysis (Yin, Zheng, & Cao, 2012) and behavior computing (Cao, 2010; Cao et al., 2012; Cao & Yu, 2012).Causal coupling: One entity causes the occurrence or dynamics of an effect or phenomenon as a consequence of another. For instance, a large buy order triggers significant market movement or a breaking news story, causing a significant increase in discussions on Twitter. Typical causal coupling learning tasks involve the learning of causation between factors (in particular entities and properties) and phenomena (such as anomaly).Synchronous coupling: Entities occur or contribute to an effect at the same time. For instance, several behaviors or social events occur at the same time, for example, two bloggers express similar comments on the same issue on different social media at the same time.Exclusive coupling: Entities take part or play roles in an exclusive way. For example, different events happen on a mutually exclusive basis; two opponent groups share different views on the same social event in a blog; or an attribute presents one particular value in a certain circumstance.Dependent coupling: The occurrence of one entity or entity status relies conditionally on another. For instance, the occurrence of a behavior relies on the pre-occurrence of a series of other behaviors. Typical learning tasks include hidden Markov model-based coupled behavior analysis (Cao et al., 2012) and copula-based financial variable dependence analysis (Cao, Cao, & Song, 2013; Wei et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2014)Different forms of couplings take place in different coupled objects. Couplings in numeric data are very different from those in categorical data. Of all the involved attributes, couplings include single entity-based couplings such as temporal coupling, pairwise coupling involving two entities, and compound coupling involving more than two entities, such as hierarchical coupling. From the knowledge representation aspect, syntactic coupling, semantic coupling, and inferential coupling can be explored. In data formation, coupling may be embedded within or between arrays, affinities such as associations, sequences, episodes, paths, artworks such as design patterns, mosaics, tessellations, and networks and graphs. In Wang and Cao (2012) and Cao (2013a), different temporal couplings and inferential couplings are discussed for coupled behaviors.In addition, there are couplings on different levels, from value, attribute, object, method, and measure to pattern. Such couplings, which are more comprehensive and complex than correlation and association, refer to the relations that exist explicitly or implicitly between source and destination entities. A source or destination entity can be a value, attribute, object, method or pattern in a problem.Often, we only focus on explicit couplings which are visible to us and easy to learn. Typical work in the hybridization of multiple methods and combining multiple sources of data into a big table for analysis fall in this category. Learning about implicit or invisible couplings is required in handling complex data and applications such as group behavior analysis (Cao et al., 2012). Such couplings may take invisible forms and are thus hard to quantify. Data-driven learning of invisible relations is an important way to explore them.In the related work, the above comprehensive couplings are often ignored or only partially addressed. Only a certain relation or correlation is considered. For example, in recommender systems, only user-user influence or item-item co-occurrence is considered. There are huge opportunities to invent new methods to explore the above different forms of couplings, especially implicit and invisible couplings in a learning system.Learning coupling refers to understanding, formalizing and quantifying the coupling aspects, entities, interactions, layers, forms and strength. This includes extracting, discovering and estimating the interactions and relationships between learning components, including method, objective, task, level, dimension, process, measure and outcome, especially when the learning involves multiples of one of the above components, for instance, multi-methods or multi-tasks. Recently, the concept of combined mining (Cao et al., 2011; Zhao, Zhang, Cao, Zhang, & Bohlscheid, 2008; Zhao, Zhang, Figueiredo, Cao, & Zhang, 2007) was proposed to analyze the coupling relationships between data sources, features (or feature sets), methods and learning outputs, which form the tasks of multi-source combined mining, multi-feature combined mining, multi-method combined mining, and combined pattern mining respectively. Combined mining represents the effort of proposing general methodologies suitable for handling couplings between different aspects.In general, one may only focus on analyzing couplings between entities and their properties (attributes). This constitutes the mainstream focus in areas including data mining and machine learning, for instance, the multi-source, multi-database, multi-view, multi-instance, multi-class, and multi-label analytical tasks. Another recent focus has been on engaging multiple methods for ensemble learning. Increasing attention has been paid to learning about the environment, constraints, interactions, and pattern relations (Cao, 2013a; Cao et al., 2008) in analyzing complex data and business. In this section, we discuss modeling couplings, measuring couplings and the curse of coupling.Typically, we are concerned about learning couplings at a range of levels from values, attributes, objects, methods and measures to learning outcomes (patterns). Such couplings, which are more comprehensive and complex than correlation and association, refer to the relations that exist explicitly or implicitly between source and destination entities and between different aspects.•Value coupling: Coupling between the values of a property is called value coupling, and is also called intra-attribute or intra-property coupling. In some cases, values are dependent; that is, dependency (or broad relations) between values exist. Numeric values share different coupling types and measurements from categorical values, therefore, different metrics need to be developed to measure value couplings. For instance, to calculate similarity between numeric values, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine distance, and correlation distance are often used. For categorical (Boolean and string) data, metrics such as Hamming distance, Jaccard dissimilarity, matching similarity, and Edit distance are used. (See examples in Section 6.1.1, particularly (Wang et al., 2011) for calculating categorical value coupling and Wang et al. (2013b) for numerical value coupling.)Property coupling: Coupling between properties, also called property coupling (or attribute coupling), reflects the influence of one property on others. Couplings between different types of properties need to be considered in different ways, for instance, as categorical property couplings and numerical property couplings. The calculation of property coupling is built on value coupling. See the inter-attribute coupling similarity in Wang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013b) for examples.Object coupling: Here, objects refer to a common type of entity, i.e. data objects in a data set, which share similarity and dissimilarity, forming object coupling. The measurement of object coupling is achieved through coupling calculation for object properties and values. A typical challenge is the heterogeneity between objects which may be considered separately in object coupling analysis. The similarity metrics reported in Wang et al. (2011) are designed to analyze coupled categorical objects, while those in Wang et al. (2013b) is for coupled numerical objects. In another case, the term similarity in document analysis does not have the property level, and Cheng et al. (2013) shows methods for measuring term coupling.Method coupling: When multiple methods (which may also be called approaches, models or algorithms) are involved, different methods may only capture a partial picture of the underlying problem, and there may be an overlapping area of different methods. This provides good reasons for ensemble learning and hybrid intelligent systems. However, the coupling between methods is not usually considered. Accordingly, method coupling analysis considers the coverage, difference and complementarity between methods in learning a problem. For example, in Wang et al. (2013a) we report some preliminary results on incorporating the coupling between ensemble clusterings.Pattern coupling: Here, pattern refers to broad learning outcomes, including frequent patterns and outliers, classes and clusters identified. There may be a relationship between the patterns discovered by one method or multiple methods, forming combined patterns such as pair patterns with pairwise subpatterns, and cluster patterns consisting of multiple subpatterns, as discussed in Cao (2013a) and Cao et al. (2011). Couplings between patterns form the basis of the need for pattern relation analysis (Cao, 2013a), which may be explored from semantic, structural and knowledge representation perspectives. In Li, Wang, Cao, and Yu (2013), relations between multiple rules are explored to identify those rules which optimally contribute to the most cost-effective detection of online banking risk.Overall, it can be seen that modeling coupling is a very promising area for further exploration. Different theories and tools need to be built to model the above different types of couplings. Although it is hard to make them generic in capturing the diverse couplings discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, here we discuss some general methodologies learned through our preliminary efforts in relevant areas (see corresponding references), which may be useful for modeling different types of couplings.•If the data related to a problem can be converted into an information table (Cao, 2013b) or multiple information tables connected with one another, then the table can be a useful tool to carry forward coupling learning. See Fig. 2for the information table showing various couplings in recommender systems.A concept of intra-coupling may be defined to capture interactions within a target element, such as an object, a property and a method in an information table, and business objects, such as for a user or an item in a recommender system. This captures the relations within a column or a row in an information table. For example, in Table A in Fig. 2, arrows connecting different ratings given by different users on the same item can be treated as intra-item coupling.Inter-coupling may be defined to catch relations between homogeneous elements, such as between samples, users and items, and between heterogeneous elements, such as between data sources, variables and methods, and between users and items in a social media system. The inter-couplings attract the interactions across columns or rows in an information table. For example, in Table A in Fig. 2, the arrows connecting different ratings across items by a user can be treated as inter-item coupling.Cross-domain coupling may be specified to record coupling (including interactions and influence) from one table to another. Here, each table refers to a particular domain. For instance, coupling across user Table B and item Table C in Fig. 2 shows the relationship between users and items in recommendation.Depending on the nature of the problem, hierarchical coupling may be considered to seize the connections between system levels, for instance, from object to object group, and from subcategory to category, as shown in Table C in Fig. 2.Aggregated coupling takes into account and combines all couplings, namely intra-couplings with inter-couplings, cross-domain couplings involving different domains, or hierarchical couplings rolling from a low level of couplings to higher levels of couplings. The example of coupled ensemble clustering in Wang et al. (2013a) shows a way of aggregating value coupling, property coupling, object coupling, cluster coupling and clustering coupling for coupled ensemble clustering.In modeling couplings, a very fundamental issue is how to measure coupling strength. This involves the need to answer two challenging questions for different purposes:(1)How do I know whether couplings exist in a data set, to what extent, and in what forms, that is, how can coupled datasets be tested?How can I measure the extent of coupling within or between specific aspects, as discussed in Section3.1, and in particular forms, as discussed in Section3.2?Answering both questions is actually very challenging, as the concept is very new to the respective research communities, including machine learning, data mining, information retrieval and even statistics. This needs to be explored from the data characteristic perspective. Our preliminary exploration of non-IIDness learning (Cao, 2013b; Cao et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013a, 2013b) gives us the following pointers that may be useful in addressing the above research problems:•In order to understand a data set, we need to understand its data structure, distributions, and main characteristics. If the data can be converted into an information table or multiple information tables, it is then reasonable to discuss the different types of couplings in Section 4.1. This exercise may help us to understand what couplings are in the data.Classic factor analysis and descriptive methods such as PCA may be used to analyze the features/variables and feature relation. This may help us to capture explicit and significant coupling before we seek to identify the much more challenging implicit coupling (which often contributes more to big data applications, as the blind person recognizing the elephant metaphor or Simpson’s Paradox (Wardrop, 1995) show).If the data follows a statistical distribution which has been well studied, one direction to pursue is to expand the corresponding similarity measures by incorporating visible and invisible couplings, as discussed in Sections 3 and 4.1.If the data is too complex to understand, it is then hard to test what the couplings are and how important they are. A comprehensive exploration of interactions in an information table related to intra-couplings, inter-couplings, cross-domain couplings, and hierarchical couplings would be extremely useful for extracting couplings by a data-driven approach.It may be necessary to quantify the level of couplings related to intra-couplings, inter-couplings, cross-domain couplings, and hierarchical couplings, by inventing new coefficient or similarity metrics, for example.If the data is complex and very domain-specific, the methodologies discussed in domain-driven data mining (Cao, Luo, & Zhang, 2009; Cao, Yu, Zhao, & Zhang, 2010) concerning data intelligence, domain intelligence, human intelligence, organizational intelligence, social intelligence and networking intelligence (Cao et al., 2009) may provide a general guide for extracting different forms of interactions related to data, domain, human, and organizational and social factors. This requires domain knowledge and the assistance of domain experts to specify and extract interactions known to them, and to provide hints about unknown interactions.Sampling a data set and then testing whether the data fits certain distributions or a mixture of several distributions is a way to explore the data structure and characteristics.Once the data-driven approach works well, it is important to develop benchmarking data sets embedded with certain levels and types of couplings. This will lead to the development of baseline approaches.Equally challenging is the exploration of the design for Question (2), which requires the definition of new coupling metrics to measure specific couplings.•Correlation coefficient and distance-based similarity metrics are widely used for numeric couplings. These tools can be used to measure coupling between values, properties, objects, methods and patterns as shown in Cheng et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013b). In other cases, they may be expanded to capture invisible coupling and coupling that cannot be represented in the preferred form.For categorical data, matching, instance-based overlapping, co-occurrence frequency etc., are typical paradigms for considering coupling measurement. The different focus here may be on how to use these tools to fully disclose the hidden coupling within and between elements.Real-life data, especially in a big data environment, often involves multi-sourced and multi-structured data sets. Exploring such data essentially requires multiple methods to be learned on multiple sources and multiple feature sets. In addition to the local issue of modeling coupling in each data source, how to match and align findings from different sources, or of different structure, with a global picture is a key problem. This may need to be considered beyond normalizing and combining individual metrics, rather than considering the coupling between the outcomes (involving pattern coupling).For an individual learning task, coupling can be measured in terms of the respective learning methods. When ensemble methods are involved, the overall similarity measure needs to consider both local coupling-based similarity between heterogeneous values, properties, objects and methods in a learning task, as well as coupling between several methods used for the same learning task.While it is certainly important and valuable to incorporate couplings within and/or between entities, attributes, context, interaction and learning modules, the consideration of couplings in learning is a very costly and challenging process. As far as we can see at the moment (the complexity of the problem has not been thoroughly explored due to this issue being at such an early stage), there are several aspects that need to be considered in coupling learning.First, it is often not clear to us what kinds of couplings are in the data, and we do not know which particular couplings we are unaware of. This is particularly the case, and very challenging, in such complex data and applications as big data-related business, which involves multiple business lines associated with different management systems and governance structures in different regions. In Section 5, Fig. 2 shows different couplings in a recommender system, which could inspire the exploration of both explicit (Tables A, B and C) and implicit (Table D) couplings, and low-level (Tables B, C, D) and high-level (Table A) couplings.Second, more couplings in learning may incur little additional gain but at a substantially higher cost. The design of similarity and objective function for coupling learning, such as the coupled clustering in Wang et al. (2011) and the coupled behavior analysis in Cao et al. (2012), needs to consider a certain level of tradeoff between computational cost and learning performance gain. For this, the aspects shown in Fig. 1 which are relevant to coupling need to be carefully selected, filtered, constructed or mined.In addition, in complex problems such as extremely rare fraud detection (Li, Wang et al., 2013), the couplings between some elements may be much weaker than others; however, they may happen to be interesting. For instance, in online banking risk management, the ratio between fraudulent and genuine transactions may be 1:1,000,000. Those transactions and banking behaviors with strong couplings are not likely to be problematic. To handle such challenging problems, the learning models may focus on capturing abnormally weak couplings rather than strong ones, so the information table based coupling learning framework may not work well.Last but not least, the coupling learning process will undoubtedly raise many unprecedented issues and questions about couplings and coupling learning: for instance,•Where are the specific couplings?What kinds of couplings are there?How can different couplings be represented?How can various couplings be measured?How can couplings be incorporated into learning models (objective functions)?Would an objective function supporting coupling learning be substantially different from existing models?If different couplings need to be considered, how can they be aggregated at the global level?How can the computational costs be reduced to make coupling learning suitable for large scale data?How can the performance of coupling learning be evaluated?The exploration of these questions will certainly create new theories and tools for learning couplings in complex data and applications. This observation applies to different areas, including statistics, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval and general information processing.In recommender systems such as online shopping websites, online broadcasting systems, IPTV, and social media, there are different types of intrinsic interactions: user-user couplings, item-item couplings, and user-item couplings. A user’s behavior may influence his/her friends, which further affects the behaviors of others. Item attributes such as item price and quantity are often associated with each other. The price of one item may affect the price of another. An item may influence the sale market of another. To ensure accurate recommendations, comprehensive couplings between item attributes, users, items, and between users and items need to be considered. In this section, we expand the concept of recommendation to particularly concern coupling relationships embedded in these aspects, which have not been thoroughly considered by the research community.Here, we use the toy example illustrated in Fig. 2 to propose a general framework for discussing and learning couplings in recommender systems, a new perspective for recommendation learning. The recommender system problem in Fig. 2 can be represented by learning from multi-sources of couplings. As shown in Fig. 2, assume we have three data sources:•Table A which records the preference (rating)Ab,cof a user b on item c.Table B which captures user demographic information, in which a user b is represented by user demographic propertiesp1topnsuch as name, sex, age and city.Table C which stores item propertiesq1toqmsuch as price, category and subcategory for each item c.Further, we assume there are couplings between users and between items, as well as between users and items, thus the existing decoupling-based approaches such as collaborative filtering models (Breese, Heckerman, & Kadie, 1998) do not work well. The learning of comprehensive couplings in a recommender system on such a three-source coupled data can be described as follows.•Preference couplings in Table A: reflecting the explicit and subjective interactions and preferences of a user for an item, which is the area mainly explored by the current recommender system community.User couplings in Table B: reflecting the interactions and influence of one user on another through both the internal factors of a user and external interactions such as friendship between users.Item couplings in Table C: indicating the relationships and connections between items through item properties and item-item connections.User-item couplings in Table D: representing the implicit and objective interactions between user properties and item properties.Aggregated couplings: involving all couplings in Tables A, B, C and D, and combining both the explicit user-item couplings represented in preference couplings in Table A with the implicit user-time couplings in Table D, as well as the impact of user couplings and item couplings on user-item couplings for prediction.Algorithms and methods for recommendation (Jannach et al., 2010; Ricci et al., 2011) can be broadly categorized into four approaches: two basic approaches, namely collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, hybrid approaches and others.Collaborative filtering (CF) predicts the rating a user may give to an item based on their own or other users’ rating behavior. When other users’ behavior is involved, a CF algorithm assumes the automatic collaboration of multiple users, and relies on group behavior and preferences similar to those of that particular user.Content-based filtering (CBF) involves a user’s comments on items, materials read or additional information such as the user’s blogs. This content can be manually defined as needed.Hybrid approaches include the integration of CF and CBF in various ways such as integrating models or modeling results to generate more accurate recommendation. The hybridization may take place in parallel (CF and CBF separately analyze the respective data and then the results are merged), or serially (e.g., CBF may be used to identify users with similar sentiments and then CF is employed to make recommendations on user behavior).Metrics and tools used for measuring recommendation quality are consistent with the approaches used. The Pearson correlation is a popular algorithm for CF. Clustering algorithms such as K-Means or K-Modes are typical tools for grouping items that share similar rating behavior from users without any prior information about the grouping and similarity. Many other data mining and machine learning methods are applicable for recommendation; they include Fuzzy C-means, Adaptive Resonance Theory, probabilistic clustering (Expectation–Maximization), Bayesian Belief Nets, Markov chains, and Rocchio classification.More recently, recommendation researchers have become interested in group recommendation (Hu et al., 2014) which focuses on group behavior analysis, and cross-domain recommendation (Hu, Cao, Xu, Cao et al., 2013; Hu, Cao, Xu, Wang et al., 2013) which borrows insights gained from one domain to inform a decision on another.So far, to the best of our knowledge, limited work has been done to incorporate couplings within and between ratings, users, items, and between users and items as shown in Fig. 2. We undertook some preliminary work in Li, Xu, Cao, and Niu (2013) in this direction. Section 5.2 provides a general statement of these types of couplings for a new generation of recommendation research.We will elaborate on different kinds of couplings in a recommender system, as shown in Fig. 2. We use the following specifications to define the diversified couplings:•A capital letter X refers to the entity set in a table in the figure, a lower case x refers to a cell in the table; accordingly X is instantiated to A – ratings in Table A, B – users in Table B, C – items in Table C, and D – user-item coupling in Table D.Xi,jindicates a matrix showing the values related to two dimensions i and j. For instance,Ai,jrefers to the rating matrix on users and items, andai1,j1refers to the cell associated with useri1on itemj1.Xa(·)(or simplyXa) refers to the intra-coupling within entities in a table. For instance,Ba(·)refers to the intra-coupling within user property values.Xe(·)(or simplyXe) refers to the inter-coupling between entities in a table. For instance,Ce(·)refers to the inter-coupling between item properties.X(·)represents a function for aggregating coupling in a table. For example,C(·)indicates all coupling existing in Table C.X(Xa(·),Xe(·))describes the integration of intra-couplingXa(·)with inter-couplingXe(·)in terms of aggregation functionX(·).RSXpresents the overall coupling similarity of entities X in the respective table.RS(·)refers to a function to integrate different aspects of coupling.Preference couplings, also called explicit or subjective user-item couplings, record the ratings given by a user to an item, which reflect the subjective preference of users for items. From a purely subjective perspective, there are user-user rating and item-item rating couplings in Table A. The rating couplingsA(·)thus indicate the relationship between the ratings given by a user to an item, which can be categorized as intra-rating couplings between usersAa(·)and inter-rating couplings between itemsAe(·), and the aggregated rating couplingsA(Aa(·),Ae(·)).Definition 5.1Explicit user-item couplingThe explicit user-item couplingRSArefers to the coupling between preference ratingrij, as shown in the rating Table A, each rating reflecting the subjective sentiment of a useruion an itemij. By incorporating the coupling between items and users in Table A, the overall explicit coupled user-item similarityRSAcan be measured by:(1)RSA=A(Aa(·),Ae(·))=A(Aj1,j2,Ai1,i2)whereAj1,j2refers to rating coupling acrossj1andj2items (namely intra-coupling in Table A), andAi1,i2refers to rating coupling acrossi1andi2users (the inter-coupling in Table A).Alternatively, if the non-IIDness in Table A can be or is actually overlooked, then(2)RSA=A(Ai,j)whereAi,jrepresents the preference rating matrix, in whichAi1,j1is the rating of userui1on itemij1, andA(·)represents the aggregation function. The ratings disclose an empirical, direct and explicit indication of the couplings between users and items.Users are coupled. The user Table B consists of intra-user couplingsBa(·), inter-user couplingsBe(·)and the aggregative couplingsB(Ba(·),Be(·)). We say users are coupled, hence they are called coupled users. The overall couplingRSBin Table B can then be represented as:(3)RSB=B(Ba(·),Be(·))Similarly, items are coupled. The item Table C consists of intra-item couplingsCa(·), inter-item couplingsCe(·), and the aggregative couplingsC(Ca(·),Ce(·)). We say items are coupled, hence they are called coupled items. Accordingly, the coupling in Table C isRSC:(4)RSC=C(Ca(·),Ce(·))Since users and items are coupled respectively and an item is associated with one to many users, users and items are coupled too. This user-time coupling can be described in terms of two types:•explicit user-item couplings (or subjective user-item couplings) in Table A as discussed in Section 5.2 andimplicit user-item couplings (or objective user-item couplings) in Table D between users and items.Although the ratings reflected in Table A are subjective, the overall rating behavior may be well supported by underlying reasons. Such underlying driving factors may be explored from objective and implicit perspectives, reflected by the underlying implicit interactions between users (coupled users) in Table B, items (coupled items) in Table C, and between users and items (which we call implicit user-item coupling) in Table D. In particular, any coupling function for a specific cell such asdi1j1in Table D is the product of matrixCafor specific item propertyqj1and matrixBafor specific user propertypi1. We call this a coupled user-item cell. The coupling in each cell in Table D, namelyDi1j1, may be a matrix to learn.Definition 5.2Coupled User-Item CellA coupled user-item celldijcorresponds to all users and items which satisfy a specific user i’s property and an item j’s property.For example, in Table D in Fig. 2, a cell CP captures all users and items with the coupling between the City property in user Table B and the Price in Table C for all users and items.Definition 5.3Implicit user-item cell couplingImplicit coupling in a user-item coupled cellDi1j1isRSDi1j1, which consists of two parts: the coupling of a useri1’s specific property on all items with item property numberj1, namelyDa(Di1j1∗)(1⩽j1∗⩽J); and the coupling of an itemj1’s specific property on all users with the user property numberi1, namelyDe(Di1∗j1)(1⩽i1∗⩽I). As a result, the implicit coupling in a user-item coupled cell isRSDi1j1:(5)RSDi1j1=RSDi1j1(Da(Di1j1∗),De(Di1∗j1))The overall implicit user-item coupling hidden in Table D has the similarityRSD, which is the aggregation of all user-item cell coupling in Table D:(6)RSD=RSDRSDi1j1where(i1≠i2)∨(j1≠j2)∧(1⩽i1,i2⩽I)∧(1⩽j1,j2⩽J). Alternatively, we may say the overall implicit user-item coupling consists of two parts: a useri1’s property-based item couplingDa(·)on all item properties, and an itemj1’s property-based user couplingDe(·)on all user properties, which are further coupled in terms ofRSD.(7)RSD=RSD(Da(·),De(·))An example in Table D in Fig. 2 is the cell CP. The full coupling in CP consists ofCPawhich captures all coupling between all item prices in a user’s City, andCPewhich calculates the coupling of all user cities on item property Price.We have discussed above the explicit user-item couplings embodied in Table A and the implicit user-item couplings in Table D. These only reflect partial aspects of the elements that contribute to the prediction of user ratings on items.Definition 5.5Aggregated User-Item CouplingsThe aggregated user-item coupling is the combination through an aggregation functionRSA+D(·)of explicit user-item couplingsRSAand implicit user-item couplingsRSD:(8)RSA+D=RSA+D(RSA,RSD)=∑i1,i2=1I∑j1,j2=1JRSA+DAAi1j1,RSDRSi1j1D⊙(Ai1j1,RSi1j1D)The objective of a recommender system is to predict a particular ratingrˆby a user on an item, which results in a rating matrixR^. For this, the complete coupling in a recommender system is embodied through four sources: coupled users in Table B, coupled items in Table C, explicit user-item interactions in Table A, and implicit user-item interactions in Table D.Definition 5.6Complete CouplingThe complete couplingRSin a recommender system requests the aggregation of the actual preferenceRSAof a user on an item in Table A, an accumulative indicationRSBof the influence between users determined by user properties and its impact on prediction, the relation between itemsRSCshown by item properties, and the underlying hidden yet comprehensive interactionsRSDbetween the user properties and item attributes driving the rating.(9)RS=RS(RSA,RSB,RSC,RSD)Note thatRSDis not a simple matrix, because it carries much information from Tables B and C and their interactions on many different properties, at different layers and on various forms. It is in fact very complicated to obtainRSD, so future studies must incorporate the implicit interactions between properties in Tables B and C.The above discussions about diverse couplings in a recommender system indicate a new paradigm which shifts the focus of recommendation design from understanding explicit user-item preference to considering both explicit and implicit user-item interactions across multiple sources, with different properties, layers and forms. This will trigger research into the next generation of recommendation algorithms and systems.The discussions about learning different types of couplings in recommender systems in Section 5 inspire us to incorporate couplings into recommendation algorithms. In this section, we discuss two preliminary studies in this direction. The first (for more details, see Yu, Wang, Gao, Cao, & Sun, 2013) considers coupled item recommendation, which incorporates couplings into items and creates a new coupled collaborative filtering (CCF) algorithm: Coupled K-modes (CK-modes). The second (for more details, see Li, Xu et al., 2013) considers the couplings between users and between items and proposes a new coupled matrix factorization (CMF) algorithm. Readers who are interested in these can find more detail in Li, Xu et al. (2013) and Yu et al. (2013).As discussed in Cao (2013b), the classic collaborative filtering algorithms ignore or only partially consider the couplings between item properties, user properties, and item-user interactions. Here, we present a coupled item-based CF by explicitly considering both intra-coupling and inter-coupling between item attributes, and aggregating them in terms of the coupled object similarity (COS) proposed in Wang et al. (2011).The coupled item similarity (CIS) between the categorical data type of items x and y is defined as follows:(10)CIS(x,y)=∑j=1nδjA(xj,yj),wherexjandyjare the values of item attribute j for items x and y, respectively; n refers to the number of item attributes; andδjAis the Coupled Attribute Value Similarity (CAVS) (see Wang et al. (2011) for details).The CAVS is further described by the Intra-coupled Attribute Value Similarity (IaAVS) measuring the item attribute value similarity by considering the feature value occurrence frequencies within an item feature, and the Inter-coupled Attribute Value Similarity (IeAVS) measuring the item attribute value similarity by taking the item attribute dependency aggregation into account.For item attribute j, IaAVSδjIa(xj,yj)is calculated as below (Wang et al., 2011),(11)δjIa(xj,yj)=|gj(x)|·|gj(y)||gj(x)|+|gj(y)|+|gj(x)|·|gj(y)|.wheregj(x)returns all objects with values x for feature j. IeAVSδjIe(xj,yk)is calculated as per(12)δj|kP(x,y)=minW⊆Vk{2-Pk|j(W|x)-Pk|j(W‾|y)},whereW‾=Vk⧹Wis the complementary set of a set W under the complete setVk. For thekthattribute value subsetW⊆Vk, and thejthattribute valuex∈Vj,Pk|j(W|x)is the Information Conditional Probability (ICP) of W with respect to x,(13)Pk|j(W|x)=gk∗(W)⋂gj(x)|gj(x)|.wheregk∗(W)maps the value set W of feature k to the dependent object set.Accordingly, CAVSδjAbetween item attribute valuesxjandyjof item attribute j is defined as follows:(14)δjA(xj,yj)=δjIa(xj,yj)·δjIe(xj,yj)Taking the K-modes clustering algorithm as an example, we create a coupled K-modes (CK-modes for short). Let S be a cluster generated by the previous partition of the K-modes algorithm. In the cluster S, there are J items described by categorical item features{aj1,aj2,…,ajl}. A mode of the cluster S is an item vectorQ=[q1,q2,…,qJ]to maximize the sum of the similaritySim(Q,S)between each element i of S and Q.(15)Sim(Q,S)=∑i=1JCIS(Si,Q)Within the CK-modes model, the item-based collaborative filtering is adjusted to generate the prediction on item y for an active user u based on all other items x. The predictionrˆu,yon item y for an active user u is computed by the following formula:(16)rˆu,y=ru,x‾+∑x∈NSim(x,y)∗(ru,y-ry‾)∑x∈NSim(x,y)where N is the number of joint items both rated by user u and grouped by the CK-modes algorithm, andru,yrepresents the rating on item y given by user u.Sim(x,y)is the coupled item similarity between items x and y.ru,x‾is the average of active user u’s ratings.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the real world, diverse coupling relationships are embedded in every business and are associated with objects, properties, processes, events, and states of affairs. Such couplings may present characteristics, which are far beyond the association, correlation and dependency relationships that usually concern statistics, data mining and machine learning communities. Triggered by behavioral, economic, social, cultural, or other driving forces, they may be explicit vs. implicit, syntactic vs. semantic, local vs. global, specific vs. comprehensive, or subjective vs. objective. Learning such couplings is far more complex than widely-explored association, correlation and dependency. The fact may be that we do not have a full picture of what kinds of couplings are in a system, how they present and evolve, and how to represent, model and measure them in a learning system.In this paper, we have conducted a high level discussion about coupling learning. Our purpose is to create a high level picture of what couplings are, why they are important, how they may present, and the issues in modeling and measuring ubiquitous couplings from a generic and comprehensive perspective. We have demonstrated several examples and case studies showing what couplings may exist and how to specify them in a recommender system, as well as illustrating how such couplings can be modeled to improve learning objectives. The discussions and exploration have hopefully highlighted promising opportunities and prospects for incorporating couplings into advancing existing learning systems, and developing the next-generation learning, analytic, computational, and measurement theories and tools.
