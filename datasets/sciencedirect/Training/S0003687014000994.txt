7 Themes for guiding situated ergonomic assessments of medical devices: A case study of an inpatient glucometer

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We report a case study of a situated ergonomic assessment of a modern inpatient blood glucose meter.We identify 19 issues with the design and use of the device.We identify 7 broad themes that can help guide future situated studies of medical devices.We highlight the need for more ergonomic case studies and guidance following the implementation of BS EN 62366.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
There is relatively little guidance on the situated ergonomic assessment of medical devices, and few case studies that detail this type of evaluation. This paper reports results of a detailed case study that focuses on the design and use of a modern blood glucose meter on an oncology ward. We spent approximately 150 h in-situ, over 11 days and 4 nights, performing observations and interviews with users. This was complemented by interviews with two staff with oversight and management responsibility related to the device. We identified 19 issues with the design and use of this device. These issues were grouped into 7 themes which can help guide the situated study of medical devices: usability, knowledge gaps and mental models, workarounds, wider tasks and equipment, the patient, connection between services, and policy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The importance of usability engineering for medical devices has been more widely recognised since the publication of Medical devices – Application of usability engineering to medical devices (BS EN 62366, 2008). Both the design and use of medical devices affect patient safety and the quality of care; both issues are a concern and priority internationally (Kohn et al., 2000; Department of Health, 2000, 2001a, 2004). The application of ergonomics continues to contribute to this area by offering frameworks (Vincent et al., 1998; Carayon et al., 2006; Sharples et al., 2012), tools and methods (Buckle et al., 2006), case studies (Martin et al., 2012; Lang et al., 2013) and challenges for researchers and practitioners to overcome (Martin et al., 2008). However, detailed empirical case studies of inpatient medical device evaluations are still needed to test and exemplify possible approaches to studying the use of devices in context; these will provide a firm foundation on which to base better guidance on how to conduct these evaluations. This paper has two main research objectives: 1) to present a detailed case study of a situated ergonomic assessment of an inpatient blood glucose meter; and 2) to identify themes that serve as guidance for design and use reviews of inpatient medical devices.
