@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Rail operations are housed inside a complex and extremely dynamic system where work is distributed in time and space. The train driver has traditionally relied on their own decisions, plans, and actions to navigate the rail environment, but the use of modern driver systems that force how these activities are regulated has altered this dynamic. This paper reports the findings of a study that set out to investigate the skills of modern (enhanced display-based) and traditional (real world) train driving. Data were collected from a variety of UK domain experts (n = 45) using an innovative methodology that converged multiple techniques for knowledge elicitation and analysis. The findings are represented in a model of dynamic train control and discussed according to the specific features and nature of tracking skill in the rail domain. The utility of the model is demonstrated through work of its application to the design of a train simulator and research tool for systematic study of rail human factor issues.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The natural train-driving environment is complex, unpredictable, and highly dynamic. Collision avoidance in this type of environment is influenced by a range of human factors issues and information processing limitations associated with sustaining attention for extended periods (Wickens and Carswell, 2007). Traditional train navigation requires the driver to process information sources held outside the cab (e.g., signals, speeds, landmarks) and apply a detailed body of route knowledge (acquired from experience). This allows the driver to connect their location with the upcoming destinations and optimise speed-error. In the traditional driver-cab, basic indicators such as a speedometer and braking gauges are used to fathom train state and carry out decision-making. Although train drivers only control the speed and acceleration of the train, train driving cognition is strategic, purposive (i.e., goal-directed), and quasi-mathematical (i.e., underpinned by mental time-distance estimations) (Branton, 1979). Whilst rail industries the world over still employ legacy systems dating back to the mid-20th century (including those in ‘developed’ countries), the last two decades have bore witness to a rapid growth in railway technology, and whilst train driving fundamentally remains unidirectional, emerging technologies are beginning to alter how train drivers correct speed-error, derive information, and correspond with their environment.Today, train technologies are designed around signal awareness (e.g., Automatic Warning System; McLeod et al., 2005), train protection (e.g., Train Protection Warning System; Fenner, 2002) and ‘supervisory’ control (e.g., Automatic Train Protection; Simpson, 1994). These systems and approaches have introduced increasing layers of autonomous control in the train. For example, the Automatic Train Protection system calculates braking distances and applies automatic brake applications if the train is likely to violate movement authority (i.e., line speeds and stop signals). In the more advanced rail networks, drivers use enhanced information displays to operate. These displays, held in the driver–cab interface, advise train operation by previewing the route and speed trajectories (e.g., Einhorn et al., 2005; Howlett and Pudney, 2000; Kitto and Groves, 2011). Some of these technologies, such as Energymeiser (pictured Fig. 1a) aim to inform decision-making. In this system, a speed trajectory is calculated based on upcoming speeds, changes to the terrain, expected fuel use, and estimated arrival times. However, control is not forced or overridden by the system, and the driver is effectively left to operate using traditional driving principles, but under the guidance of a display that presents “what-if” scenarios. Thus, the driver may elect to follow the optimal trajectory (depicted horizontally) and influence how conservatively it is calculated (using soft-keys to increase or decrease estimated arrival times), and whilst some movement authority is shown (i.e., line speeds), signals are still located outside the cab.Other systems migrate the signalling and movement authorities into the cab, and adopt a driver-train dynamic that relegates more control to the machine. For example, the European Train Control System (ETCS, pictured in Fig. 1b) previews the route but also parameterises (i.e., enforces) how train movement is to be regulated by the human. Upcoming route features are displayed in a planning area along with a feature that instructs the time to brake, and the system applies automatic throttle/braking if speed deviates from these prescribed limits (CENELEC, 2005). In ETCS, the speed trajectory is also displayed around the outside (i.e., perimeter) of the speedometer. These are all important distinctions as the resulting driver-train dynamic operates within an observable margin that has an upper (max) and lower (min) boundary, which the needle of the speedometer should be kept within at all times. Thus, train driving is underpinned by a system that monitors what the train driver does and if system parameters are violated, driver control is overridden to return speed within the predefined boundaries. This type of system does not aim to cater for “what-if” type decision-making, but rather, aims to instruct and enforce a scripted type of control. This driver-train dynamic is defined here as the ‘modern’ train-driving task, where an in-cab authority enforces how train movement and speed is regulated. In the case of the ETCS system, these are displayed to the driver with an enhanced information interface displaying a dynamic speed trajectory. Note that both the Energymeiser and ETCS systems are used in commercial intercity passenger and freight operations at the time of writing this paper.Clearly, there are immediate and observable differences between Fig. 1a and b. For example, Energymeiser is horizontally oriented, whereas the ETCS system adopts a vertical orientation (i.e., towards direction of travel). However, irrespective of the similarities and differences, both of these displays show that rail technology is fundamentally evolving along the lines of augmented reality. This is where specific domain features from the natural rail environment are being abstracted into the cab. One direction leading on from this is to better support the traditional driving task (à la Energymeiser), and the other, to hand one or more components of the task over to a machine authority (à la ETCS). Suffice it to say, the growth in technology has adjusted the task- and skill-based needs of the modern train driver, and engendered new models of task representation aiming to extend the knowledge base. These models can be divided broadly into situation- and skill-based categories. Situational models typically extend Endsley's (1995) general model of situation awareness to depict the factors and processes converging around the driver, and provide a holistic snapshot of the system at any one time (e.g., Luther et al., 2007; McLeod et al., 2005; Roth and Multer, 2009). Skill-based models describe the train driving process by emphasising the human capabilities of the operator, and use cyclical feed-back/feed-forward processing loops with roots in control engineering (e.g., Hamilton and Clarke, 2005). Both types of model are extremely useful for conceptualising the process, illustrating the nature of the task, and showing performance constraints. However, there are a number of gaps in the current corpus of train driving performance literature that warrant further research.First, whilst studies have explored the human-train dynamics of situation awareness and driving skill in the traditional task, few have profiled how relatively complex, dynamic, and opaque the task actually is. These features form the theoretical underpinning for simulation design for operational task environments, and identifying them would better specify the development of full-task ecological research tools such as rail simulators, or part-task simulations of the train driving task, such as scaled worlds, and microworlds (Brehmer and Dörner, 1993; Cañas and Waern, 2005). Second, even fewer studies have extended their research of the human-train dynamic to the modern driving context. While some work has speculated over the potential impact of the modern task, explicit investigation of the skill- or situation-based aspects of train driving when speed is enforced and parameterised by enhanced information displays (e.g., like ETCS) has yet to be undertaken. Hamilton and Clarke (2005) described a short study that used behaviour modelling to explore this type of driving, but it was based on very early data. The main focus in this work was also on explanatory concepts (e.g., memory stores), not on examining the similarities or difference between driving in the traditional and modern contexts. Lastly, train driving performance models have been applied in a variety of settings, for example to predict the time and workload implications of different operating conditions (Hamilton and Clarke, 2005), or to evaluate performance in specific cultural contexts (Sani and Dawal, 2010). However, few have modelled performance to aid with the design and development of intelligent technologies based on specific skill (e.g., enhanced information displays). Taken together, these aims illustrate a general need to explore modern driving, and to develop a substantive train performance model that captures the different driving tasks, to meet the needs of wider communities of interest and practice (e.g., simulation development, display design).The main objective of this research was to explore how traditional train driving skill and dynamic was affected by technological advancements in the rail system. The study had three main aims:1)To establish the complex, dynamic, and opaque features in train driving;To distinguish train driving when it is undertaken traditionally from when it is performed with systems/displays that parameterise (i.e., enforce) how control is regulated; andTo develop a model of train driving performance that broadly captures traditional and modern performance, for further thinking and research.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In conclusion, the main objective of this study was to explore how traditional train driving skill and dynamic was affected by technological advancements in the rail system. It aimed to distinguish train operation in traditional and modern driving, establish its complex, dynamic, and opaque features, and develop a model that captured performance in the traditional and modern tasks. The study applied an innovative data collection methodology incorporating several analytical and visualisation techniques to elicit knowledge and investigate train driving skill from a multi-task perspective. Both the modern and traditional train-driving tasks were found to possess features that straddled complexity, dynamism and opacity on several levels. The findings showed that though the requirement for speed-error correction essentially remained the same, the driver-train dynamic in the traditional and modern driving tasks was very different. It also revealed that bringing the signals and movement authority into the cab, did not necessary increase the transparency of the task. These findings were conceptualised in a general multi-task model of dynamic control. The model contributes to other situation and skill-based train driving models through its unique illustration of skill and focus on multiple tasks.
