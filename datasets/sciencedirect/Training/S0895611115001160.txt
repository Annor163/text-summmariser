@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Fiber tractography techniques in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging have become a primary tool for studying the fiber architecture of biological tissues both noninvasively and in vivo. Streamline tracking, as a simple and efficient tractography technique, is widely used to reconstruct fiber pathways. It is however very sensitive to noisy estimation of local fiber orientations. In this paper, we propose a bundle constrained streamline method to accurately reconstruct multifiber pathways. The method introduces neighboring fiber consistency constraint in the tracking process and reconstructs fiber pathways that have optimal tradeoff between consistency with local fiber orientation estimations and similarity with neighboring fiber segment orientations. Results on synthetic, physical phantom and real human brain DW images show that the proposed method allows regular fiber pathways to be reconstructed and outperforms existing techniques.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography provides a primary tool for studying the fiber architecture of biological tissues both noninvasively and in vivo. The technique allows us to estimate neuronal tract pathways to determine both the structure and the connectivity of the brain.Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based streamline tracking was the first technique proposed and has been largely used to reconstruct fiber pathways in the human brain [1]. However, the DTI has been shown to fail in regions presenting intravoxel orientational heterogeneity such as fiber or fiber bundle crossing and branching. A number of more sophisticated models for estimating multiple fiber orientations (MFOs) within a voxel have been proposed in order to overcome the single orientation limitation of DTI. We cite, for instance, multitensor based models [2–4], high-order diffusion tensor [5], Q-Ball [6,7], diffusion spectrum imaging [8], spherical deconvolution [9–11], independent component analysis (ICA) from DTI [12], etc. More details can be found in [13,14].To reconstruct multifiber pathways form the MFO system, several extensions of DTI-based streamline have been proposed for white matter tractography. A modified fiber assignment using the continuous tracking method was proposed to reconstruct tracts along the MFOs obtained from Q-Ball imaging [15]. Two-tensor based streamline tractography was successfully obtained in the regions of crossing fibers [16]. ICA based streamline was also developed to conduct human brain tractography from diffusion data [17]. In the above-mentioned streamline tracking techniques, fiber pathways are constructed based on local fiber orientation estimation in a step-by-step way. Therefore, the accuracy of the reconstruction is sensitive to the estimation of intravoxel fiber orientations and suffers from cumulative errors along the tracking path.Recently, global optimization based methods have been reported to reconstruct the most probable paths in the whole brain. These methods estimate fiber pathways by a cost function minimization or posterior probability maximization process. Some of the global methods consider the optimization of the path between two designated regions to produce optimal trajectories [18–21]. Others reconstruct full fiber tracts over the whole brain at once [22–25]. The global methods are less affected by the noisy estimation of local fiber orientations and the cumulative errors. However, they are generally computationally intensive and may not satisfy the requirement of practical uses.In this paper, we propose a bundle constrained streamline (BCS) method which introduces the orientation information of neighboring fibers in the process of the streamline tracking to overcome the sensitivity to the local uncertainty in the estimation of intravoxel fiber orientations. Based on the assumption of local fiber consistency (i.e. the neighboring fiber pathways are similar in local orientation), the method reconstructs fiber pathways that have optimal tradeoff between consistency with local fiber orientation estimations and similarity with neighboring fiber segment orientations.
