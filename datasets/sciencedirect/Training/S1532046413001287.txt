BackgroundTime is a measurable and critical resource that affects the quality of services provided in clinical practice. There is limited insight into the effects of time restrictions on clinicians’ cognitive processes with the electronic health record (EHR) in providing ambulatory care.ObjectiveTo understand the impact of time constraints on clinicians’ synthesis of text-based EHR clinical notes.MethodsWe used an established clinician cognitive framework based on a think-aloud protocol. We studied interns’ thought processes as they accomplished a set of four preformed ambulatory care clinical scenarios with and without time restrictions in a controlled setting.ResultsInterns most often synthesized details relevant to patients’ problems and treatment, regardless of whether or not the time available for task performance was restricted. In contrast to previous findings, subsequent information commonly synthesized by clinicians related most commonly to the chronology of clinical events for the unrestricted time observations and to investigative procedures for the time-restricted sessions. There was no significant difference in the mean number of omission errors and incorrect deductions when interns synthesized the EHR clinical notes with and without time restrictions (3.5±0.5 vs. 2.3±0.5, p=0.14).ConclusionOur results suggest that the incidence of errors during clinicians’ synthesis of EHR clinical notes is not increased with modest time restrictions, possibly due to effective adjustments of information processing strategies learned from the usual time-constrained nature of patient visits. Further research is required to investigate the effects of similar or more extreme time variations on cognitive processes employed with different levels of expertise, specialty, and with different care settings.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the ongoing adoption and utilization of EHR systems within mainstream patient care and healthcare operations, work into understanding mechanisms and solutions to challenges with clinician–computer interactions have emerged as fundamental areas of clinical informatics research. Recent studies have illustrated the importance of evaluating clinician efficiency with HIT towards successful individual and organizational adoption of HIT solutions [1–4]. Accordingly, recognized cognitive scientists have laid significant emphases on understanding clinicians’ reasoning models and cognitive demands during decision-making to investigate clinician competency and effectively support clinical problem-solving [5–7]. Researchers have also studied clinician behavior while interacting with patients and EHR systems to inform the design of future systems to effectively support clinician workflow and reduce cognitive burden within their practice environment [2,8–12].Although time pressures appear to compound clinicians’ cognitive load and multitasking activities while providing care in the typically stressful emergency department [12], there is limited insight on the effects time restrictions can have on clinicians’ cognitive processes while providing ambulatory care in using EHR systems. In follow-up to our previous study investigating cognitive processes involved in synthesizing electronic clinical documents [13], we investigated in this study the effects of time constraints on clinician cognitive processes in synthesizing EHR clinical text notes.The continuous need for clinicians to review multiple EHR clinical documents during the typical out-patient visit increases the likelihood of overloading their working memory (WM) in the short duration available for complex cognitive activities related to patient care [14–16]. Verbalized perceptions and related behavior identified by use of qualitative methods can be linked directly to reasoning strategies, information processing and overall cognition of a clinician as observed while s/he performs certain clinical problem solving [17,18]. Insight on the relationship between time constraints and clinicians’ cognitive processes may shed more light on potential barriers to effective synthesis of EHR clinical documents at the point of care. Furthermore, knowledge of elements of clinician–computer interaction related to specific tasks and time constraints can assist in framing EHR system design strategies required to better support characteristic cognitive processes and behavior [19].
