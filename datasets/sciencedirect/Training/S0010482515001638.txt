@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Epilepsy is a critical neurological disorder resulting from abnormal hyper-excitability of neurons in the brain. Studies have shown that epilepsy can be detected in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of patients suffering from seizures. The performance of EEG-based epileptic seizure detection relies largely on how well one can extract features from an EEG that characterize seizure activity. Conventional feature extraction methods using time-series analysis, spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis have advanced in recent years to improve detection. The computational complexity has also increased to obtain a higher detection rate. This study aimed to develop an efficient feature extraction method based on Hjorth׳s mobility to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy. A new feature extraction method was proposed by computing the spectral power of Hjorth׳s mobility components, which were effectively estimated by differentiating EEG signals in real-time. Using EEG data in five epileptic patients, this method resulted in a detection rate of 99.46% between interictal and epileptic EEG signals and 99.78% between normal and epileptic EEG signals, which is comparable to most advanced nonlinear methods. These results suggest that the spectral features of Hjorth׳s mobility components in EEG signals can represent seizure activity and may pave the way for developing a fast and reliable epileptic seizure detection method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The symptoms of epilepsy are characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures, called epileptic seizures, resulting from excessive neuronal activity in the brain [1]. Epileptic seizures negatively affect physical and psychological behavior, resulting in significant social maladaptation and even death [1,2]. The etiology of epilepsy is known to include lesions in the brain and genetic abnormalities, leading to impaired neuronal regulation; however, epilepsy can also be caused by unknown factors that are difficult to identify [1]. The prognosis and diagnosis of epilepsy are highly dependent on the interpretation of neuronal activity in the brain. Consequently, the detection of epileptic signs embedded in neural activity is of great importance.Due to its simplicity and efficiency, electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used in epilepsy research [3]. EEG signals during seizures show distinct patterns that reflect excessive neuronal activity; hence, epilepsy can be diagnosed by monitoring epileptic characteristics by EEG. However, this monitoring process is often time consuming, burdensome, and dependent on visual inspection [4]. To overcome these limitations, various computational models have been developed for automated epileptic seizure detection. A number of studies have proposed computational models to extract epileptic EEG features using time-series analysis with correlation [5], autoregressive (AR) model parameters [6], and Hjorth׳s parameters [7], or the use of frequency analysis with the Fourier transform [8] and wavelet transform [9]. More complicated features have also been extracted using nonlinear dynamics properties, including correlation dimension [10], wavelet entropy [11], approximate entropy, and Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy [12]. Once specific features are determined, a classifier is built and used to detect epileptic EEG patterns. Many epilepsy classifiers have been designed using machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). To date, a variety of ANNs and other machine learning methods have been developed for seizure detection, including probabilistic neural network (PNN) [13], multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) [14], spiking neural network (SNN) [15], recurrent Elman network (REN) [11], and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) [16].Efforts to improve epileptic seizure detection by identifying more reliable features and employing further advanced machine learning algorithms have demonstrated quite accurate detection results. Despite their successful results, these approaches can suffer from great computational complexity, particularly when nonlinear features/models are used. The models using nonlinear features and/or nonlinear classifiers require multiple processing steps and complex computational procedures, rendering them inappropriate for real-time diagnoses. To reduce the computational burden while maintaining accuracy, this study sought a new approach for epileptic seizure detection. The goal is to maximize computational simplicity without sacrificing detection accuracy compared to current nonlinear models.Toward that end, features were created using one of Hjorth׳s parameters, mobility [7], which has been widely used in time-series analyses of electroencephalograms. Mobility was estimated by time-domain differentiation and was then transformed to the frequency-domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Once a spectral mobility feature space was created, a classifier based on Fisher discriminant (FD) analysis or MLPNN was built to detect seizure activity. Using the same dataset, the detection performance of the new method was compared to those of previous nonlinear methods to determine whether it could provide state-of-the-art detection accuracy.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A novel method to detect epileptic seizure activity from intracranial EEG recordings was proposed. In this method, signal features were extracted using time-domain differentiation (based on Hjorth׳s mobility) and fast Fourier transform, and these features were classified using a linear classifier. Epileptic seizure detection using this method resulted in 99.46% accuracy between intracranial interictal and intracranial epileptic signals, and 99.78% accuracy between scalp normal and intracranial epileptic signals. It was shown that time-domain differentiation significantly increased classification accuracy between intracranial interictal and epileptic signals. In particular, specificity was more markedly increased than was sensitivity, indicating that this method effectively decreased the false positive rate (i.e., healthy subjects incorrectly diagnosed as epileptic). By optimizing the window and step sizes, it was found that higher classification accuracy was obtained with larger window sizes and smaller step sizes. Also, it was discovered that time-domain differentiation successfully enhanced classification accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in another well-known approach based on AR-MLPNN. This may imply that time-domain differentiation can be a useful tool in detecting epileptic signatures in EEG signals. In this study, only one of Hjorth׳s parameters, mobility, was used for epileptic feature extraction.There is no conflict of interest.
