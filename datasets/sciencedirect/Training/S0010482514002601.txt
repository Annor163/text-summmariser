@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of the present study is to investigate urodynamic characteristics of rats with detrusor instability (DI) induced by different causes. Forty-eight adult female Sprague–Dawly rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: cyclophosphamide group, bladder outlet obstruction group, lipopolysaccharide group and control group. The BL-410 model bio-function experimental system was applied to monitor bladder pressure and a number of urodynamic parameters were recorded and calculated, including the frequency of detrusor instability, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), intercontraction interval (ICI), voiding time (VT), postvoid residual (PVR) and bladder compliance (BC). The positive rates of DI in cyclophosphamide group, bladder outlet obstruction group and lipopolysaccharide group were 83.33%, 75.00% and 58.33%, respectively. And correspondingly the frequency of DI was 10.00±2.00, 4.87±1.24 and 3.50±1.00tmin−1, which was significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the decrease of MVP, MCC, ICI, VT and BC was noted in the cyclophosphamide group and lipopolysaccharide group. Increased PVR, MVP, MCC, VT and BC were presented in the bladder outlet obstruction group. Therefore, we suggested that the urodynamic parameters could reflect the pathophysiological characteristics of DI induced by different causes, which could systematically benefit the diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In 2002, International Continence Society (ICS) defined overactive bladder (OAB) as urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually accompany with urinary frequency and nocturia. And its urodynamic manifestation is detrusor instability (DI) during the filling phase [1,2]. The prevalence of this syndrome in adults is approximately 11.8% and rises with age [3].In clinical practices, it has been frequently reported that OAB is associated with multiple diseases, including bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), neurogenic bladder dysfunction and urogenital system infection. It implied that they can exert enormous impact on the patient׳s health-related quality of life (HRQL). Therefore, it is necessary to establish the animal model similar to human OAB to identify its risk factors. In this study, three methods were applied to trigger DI in rats to investigate the urodynamic features of OAB.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Although, the rat models of DI induced by different causes presented the same characteristics, including decreased intercontraction interval and increased unstable contraction of detrusors, the urodynamics showed something different, which reflected the pathophysiologic characteristics of the bladder. Therefore, urodynamic studies could cast light on the diagnosis and prognosis of OAB.We declare that we have no conflict of interest.
