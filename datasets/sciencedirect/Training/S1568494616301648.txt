@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of this paper is to develop a projection-based compromising method for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The concept of projections considers not only the distance but also the included angle between evaluative ratings of alternative actions with respect to a criterion. In the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy context, this paper determines the respective projections of the evaluative ratings of each alternative on the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions and explores several essential properties. Next, this paper introduces the concepts of projection-based compromising indices and comprehensive compromising indices and further investigates relevant theorems for supporting the usefulness of these indices. Additionally, this paper proposes the projection-based comparative index and the comprehensive comparative index to serve as benchmark values for the comparison purpose. The improvement percentage of the comprehensive compromising value is acquired to determine the priority order of the alternatives, including the complete ranking order and the approval status for each alternative. The feasibility and the applicability of the proposed method are validated with an application problem of watershed site selection. Finally, several comparative analyses are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method over other relevant compromising decision-making methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple criteria decision-making problems address the ranking of alternatives and the selection of the best compromise alternative among a finite set of alternatives based on a finite set of criteria [18,37]. Decision makers are not always certain about their given decision or preference information and they often have some degree of uncertainty [29]. Moreover, exact data may be difficult to be precisely determined since human judgments are often vague under many conditions [15]. Thus, uncertain and imprecise assessment of information often occurs in practical decision situations [48,53], especially with respect to a lack of knowledge and experience, intangible and non-monetary criteria, the decision maker’s limited information-processing capability, and a complex socio-economic environment [7,9,10,57]. Under these circumstances, dealing with imprecision or uncertainties in subjective judgments and evaluations becomes increasingly complex and important in multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) [10,27,51]. Accordingly, an extension to the fuzzy environment is a natural generalization of MCDA methods.In fuzzy community, Atanassov and Gargov [5] introduced the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) sets, which is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets [1,2]. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets have better flexibility and practicality in the treatment of fuzzy information and uncertainty than ordinary fuzzy sets [6,23–25]. However, it is not completely justifiable or technically sound to quantify degrees of membership and non-membership in terms of a single numeric value in human cognitive and decision-making activities [25,26,34]. IVIF sets provide an effective and convenient way to resolve the difficulty. IVIF sets are characterized by the degree of membership, the degree of non-membership, and the degree of non-determinacy whose values are intervals rather than exact numbers [3,4]. Accordingly, IVIF sets are better than intuitionistic fuzzy sets for their great ability to handle imprecise and ambiguous information in practical applications [8,11,12,38]. Real-world decisions always require the use of more precise and accurate data [20]; thus, IVIF sets are appropriate for addressing MCDA problems within a complex and uncertain environment. IVIF sets have been applied productively in the MCDA field [7–9,11,12,14,16,17,19,28,30,31,36,39,52,55].Compared with the existing MCDA methods based on IVIF sets, comparatively little research has focused on the development of the projection methods and techniques within the IVIF environment. The projection method [45–47,49] is a much better measure than the distance measure that has been widely used in many aspects of the MCDA methodology. The concept of projections considers not only the distance but also the module and included angle between objects evaluated [44,47,49]. Thus, the replacement for the distance measure by the projection measure can more fully consider the separation between two objectives measured. Accordingly, the existing MCDA methods and techniques would be evidently improved if the distance measure or other separation measures were replaced by the projection measure. Approaches that use projection techniques have been applied successfully to address multiple criteria decision-making problems [41,44–47,49,50,52,54,56]. However, little attention has been given to the employment of the projection methods for MCDA in the IVIF context. For example, the projections used in Yue [45] and Zheng et al. [56] were defined on ordinary numbers. The projections used in Wang et al. [41], Yue [46], and Yue and Jia [50] were defined on interval numbers. Consider the projection methods in intuitionistic fuzzy and/or IVIF contexts. Xu and Hu [44] established two projection models to measure the similarity degrees between each alternative and the intuitionistic fuzzy ideal point, and between each alternative and the IVIF ideal point for ranking alternatives. In a manner similar to the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), Yue [47] established a relative closeness of each alternative decision with respect to their projections on ideal decisions to solve the partner selection problem with linguistic values and intuitionistic fuzzy information. Based on intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Zhang et al. [54] used the information entropy method to determine the criterion weight and proposed the grey relational projection method to rank alternatives. Zeng et al. [52] proposed a projection method to derive experts’ weights and handle multiple criteria group decision-making problems with intuitionistic fuzzy sets and IVIF sets. Yue and Jia [49] developed an extended TOPSIS method for group decision making with hybrid intuitionistic fuzzy information. In these works, the projections used in Xu and Hu [44], Yue [47], Zeng et al. [52], and Zhang et al. [54] were defined on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In particular, Xu and Hu [44], Yue and Jia [49], and Zeng et al. [52] also investigated the projections defined on IVIF numbers. On the whole, within the literature on the decision-making methods in the IVIF context, notably few attempts have been made to develop a projection comparison approach for solving MCDA problems with IVIF sets. The theory of IVIF sets is useful and valuable for depicting uncertainty and managing imprecision in decision information. From this perspective, this paper attempts to propose a new compromising decision-making method based on projections between IVIF numbers for addressing MCDA problems within the decision environment of IVIF sets.The purpose of this paper is to develop a projection-based compromising method for MCDA with IVIF information. First, this paper explores several essential properties of the cosine of the included angle between the evaluative ratings of an alternative and the ideal solution. Additionally, the respective projections of the evaluative ratings of an alternative on the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions are proposed, and some important properties are investigated as well. Next, this paper introduces new useful concepts of projection-based compromising indices and comprehensive compromising indices. Moreover, some relevant theorems are developed to support these indices. This paper employs a newly-developed measure proposed by Guo [17] to define the comprehensive compromising value for each alternative. To compare the comprehensive compromising value with the benchmark value, this paper further proposes the concepts of projection-based comparative indices and comprehensive comparative indices. Considering the comprehensive comparative value as a benchmark value for the comparison purpose, this paper establishes the improvement percentage of the comprehensive compromising value for each alternative. All of the alternatives can be ranked according to the descending order of the improvement percentages. Furthermore, the alternatives can be differentiated into the better compromise choices that are approved and preferred to recommend and the worse compromise choices that are not approved to recommend. To demonstrate the feasibility and the applicability of the developed methods, an illustrative application is employed to explore the problem of watershed site selection. This paper also conducts some comparisons with other relevant compromising decision-making methods and validates the effective use of the proposed method.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the concepts of IVIF sets and introduces the concept of projections. Section 3 describes an MCDA problem in an IVIF setting and develops a new compromising decision-making method using a projection-based compromising approach for addressing MCDA problems involving IVIF information. Section 4 demonstrates the feasibility and the applicability of the proposed methodology using a practical application, i.e., the selection of watershed sites. This section also compares the solution results yielded by other relevant compromising methods with those of the proposed method. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions.Definition 1[3–5] Let X be a finite universal set. Let Int([0,1]) denotes the set of all closed subintervals of the unit interval [0,1]. An IVIF setA˜in X is an object that has the following form:[3–5] For each IVIF setA˜in X, the hesitation interval (or intuitionistic fuzzy interval) relative toA˜for eachx∈Xis defined as follows:[42–44,52] For each IVIF setA˜in X, the trinity(μA˜(x),νA˜(x),πA˜(x))is called an IVIF number and denoted byA˜x. Additionally, the module ofA˜xis defined as follows:[44,47] For two IVIF numbersA˜x(=(μA˜(x),νA˜(x),πA˜(x))) andB˜x(=(μB˜(x),νB˜(x),πB˜(x))) in X, the cosine of the included angle betweenA˜xandB˜xis defined as follows:The projection ofA˜xonB˜xis determined by:(8)ProjB˜x(A˜x)=|A˜x|⋅cos(A˜x,B˜x).Definition 5[3,4] For two IVIF numbersA˜xandB˜xin X, some basic operations betweenA˜xandB˜xare defined as follows:This section presents a new compromising decision-making method using a projection-based compromising approach for addressing MCDA problems within the IVIF decision environment.Consider an MCDA problem in which the ratings of the alternative evaluations and criterion importance are expressed as IVIF sets. Let a finite setZ={z1,z2,…,zm}denote the set of decision alternatives, where m is the number of alternatives. Let a finite setX={x1,x2,…,xn}denote the criterion set that contains the criteria by which the alternative performances are measured, where n is the number of criteria. The criterion set X is generally a disjoint union of the subsets XI and XII (i.e.,XI∩XII=ϕandXI∪XII=X), where XI denotes a collection of benefit criteria, and XII denotes a collection of cost criteria. Let an IVIF setA˜ibe the characteristic of the alternative zi. Let an IVIF numberA˜ijdenote the evaluative rating of alternativezi∈Zwith respect to criterionxj∈X. Similarly, let an IVIF setW˜denote the characteristic of importance weights defined on the criterion set X and an IVIF numberW˜jdenotes the importance weight of criterionxj∈X. Respective definitions ofA˜i,A˜ij,W˜, andW˜jare shown in Eqs. (13)–(16) of Table 1.Note that the proposed method does not incorporate the normalization constraint into the importance weights. Wang (2013) introduced the concept of normalized intuitionistic fuzzy weights. Later, Liao and Xu [23] based on the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy weights to establish a multiplicative consistent intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation. The normalization constraints of the intuitionistic fuzzy weights can be extended to the IVIF environment. These extended constraints can be incorporated into the characteristicW˜of importance weights depending on the decision maker’s requirements. Next, we present the projection ofA˜ijon the evaluative ratings of the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions and investigate some important properties.In general, the positive-ideal solution is composed of all best criterion ratings attainable, whereas the composite of all worst criterion ratings attainable is the negative-ideal solution. Thus, the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions are dependent on the limits and constraints of the current decision environment. In particular, the ideal solutions are usually unattainable or infeasible. To be as close as possible to the positive-ideal solution and to be as far as possible from the negative-ideal solution are the rationales of the decision maker’s choice. Accordingly, this paper regards the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions as the points of reference to develop a projection-based compromising method for determining the priority orders of the alternatives. In the IVIF context, the positive-ideal solution is defined as a collection of best evaluative ratings in all criteria considered. The negative-ideal solution is defined as a collection of worst evaluative ratings in all criteria considered within the IVIF environment. Let two IVIF setsA˜*andA˜#denote the characteristics of the positive-ideal solution z*and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively. Relevant definitions are shown in Eqs. (17)–(24) of Table 1.Theorem 1LetA˜ij,A˜*j, andA˜#jbe the evaluative ratings of the alternativezi∈Z, the positive-ideal solution z*, and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively, with respect toxj∈X. Letcos(A˜ij,A˜*j)andcos(A˜ij,A˜#j)denote the cosines of the included angle betweenA˜ijandA˜*jand betweenA˜ijandA˜#j, respectively, and they satisfy the following properties:(T1.1)cos(A˜ij,A˜*j)=cos(A˜*j,A˜ij)andcos(A˜ij,A˜#j)=cos(A˜#j,A˜ij);(T1.2)0≤cos(A˜ij,A˜*j)≤1and0≤cos(A˜ij,A˜#j)≤1;(T1.3)cos(A˜ij,A˜*j)=1if and only ifA˜ij=A˜*j;(T1.4)cos(A˜ij,A˜#j)=1if and only ifA˜ij=A˜#j.ProofSee Appendix A.LetA˜ij,A˜*j, andA˜#jbe the evaluative ratings of the alternativezi∈Z, the positive-ideal solution z*, and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively, with respect toxj∈X. The projectionsProjA˜*j(A˜ij),ProjA˜#j(A˜ij),ProjA˜ij(A˜*j), andProjA˜ij(A˜#j)satisfy the following properties:(T2.1)0≤ProjA˜*j(A˜ij)≤|A˜ij|,0≤ProjA˜ij(A˜*j)≤|A˜*j|,0≤ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)≤|A˜ij|, and0≤ProjA˜ij(A˜#j)≤|A˜#j|;(T2.2)(ProjA˜*j(A˜ij))/(ProjA˜ij(A˜*j))=|A˜ij|/|A˜*j|and(ProjA˜#j(A˜ij))/(ProjA˜ij(A˜#j))=|A˜ij|/|A˜#j|;(T2.3)ProjA˜*j(A˜ij)=ProjA˜ij(A˜*j)=|A˜ij|ifA˜ij=A˜*j;(T2.4)ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=ProjA˜ij(A˜#j)=|A˜ij|ifA˜ij=A˜#j.ProofSee Appendix B.Consider the projectionsProjA˜*j(A˜ij)andProjA˜#j(A˜ij)ofA˜ijonA˜*jandA˜ijonA˜#j, respectively, with respect to each benefit criterionxj∈XI. The greater the value ofProjA˜*j(A˜ij), the closerA˜ijtoA˜*j, i.e., the closer the evaluative rating of the alternative zito that of the positive-ideal solution z*, and thus, the better the evaluative ratingA˜ijis. On the contrary, the smaller the value ofProjA˜#j(A˜ij), the fartherA˜ijfromA˜#j, i.e., the farther the evaluative rating of the alternative zito that of the negative-ideal solution z#, and thus, the better the evaluative ratingA˜ijis. On the other hand, consider the projectionsProjA˜ij(A˜*j)andProjA˜ij(A˜#j)ofA˜*jonA˜ijandA˜#jonA˜ij, respectively, for each cost criterionxj∈XII. The greater the value ofProjA˜ij(A˜*j), the closerA˜*jtoA˜ij, i.e., the closer the evaluative rating of the positive-ideal solution z*to that of the alternative zi, and thus, the better the evaluative ratingA˜ijis. In contrast, the smaller the value ofProjA˜ij(A˜#j), the fartherA˜#jfromA˜ij, i.e., the farther the evaluative rating of the negative-ideal solution z#to that of the alternative zi, and thus, the better the evaluative ratingA˜ijis.However, with respect to a specific benefit criterionxj∈XI, any alternative zihas the highestProjA˜*j(A˜ij)value is not guaranteed to have the lowestProjA˜#j(A˜ij)value, and vice versa. Additionally, for a specific cost criterionxj∈XII, any alternative zihas the highestProjA˜ij(A˜*j)value is not guaranteed to have the lowestProjA˜ij(A˜#j)value, and vice versa. Thus, an appropriate compensatory model must be established to permit tradeoffs among evaluative ratings of alternative actions with respect to criteria. With these considerations, this paper defines the concept of projection-based compromising indices and then develops a new compromising decision-making procedure for determining a projection-based solution.This subsection uses a projection-based compromising approach to develop a new MCDA method for acquiring the priority order of alternative actions within the decision environment of IVIF sets.Definition 6LetA˜ij,A˜*j, andA˜#jbe the evaluative ratings of the alternativezi∈Z, the positive-ideal solution z*, and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively, with respect toxj∈X, whereX=XI∪XII. The projection-based compromising indexPijofA˜ijis defined as follows:Note that Definition 6 would be meaningless ifProjA˜*j(A˜ij)+ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=0forxj∈XIorProjA˜ij(A˜*j)+ProjA˜ij(A˜#j)=0forxj∈XII. To avoid the occurrence of meaninglessness in projection-based compromising indices, a set of simultaneous equalities and inequalities will be constructed to investigate the solution forProjA˜*j(A˜ij)+ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=0orProjA˜ij(A˜*j)+ProjA˜ij(A˜#j)=0.Consider the case forxj∈XI. According to (T2.1), it is known that(26)ProjA˜*j(A˜ij)=μij−⋅μ*j−+μij+⋅μ*j++νij−⋅ν*j−+νij+⋅ν*j++πij−⋅π*j−+πij+⋅π*j+|A˜*j|≥0,(27)ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=μij−⋅μ#j−+μij+⋅μ#j++νij−⋅ν#j−+νij+⋅ν#j++πij−⋅π#j−+πij+⋅π#j+|A˜#j|≥0.Because|A˜*j|>0and|A˜#j|>0, the required conditions ofProjA˜*j(A˜ij)+ProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=0 are as follows:(28)μij−⋅μ*j−+μij+⋅μ*j++νij−⋅ν*j−+νij+⋅ν*j++πij−⋅π*j−+πij+⋅π*j+=0,(29)μij−⋅μ#j−+μij+⋅μ#j++νij−⋅ν#j−+νij+⋅ν#j++πij−⋅π#j−+πij+⋅π#j+=0.Combining Eqs. (28) and (29) with the axiomatic conditions of IVIF numbers, the following simultaneous equalities and inequalities can be established:(30){μij−⋅μ*j−+μij+⋅μ*j++νij−⋅ν*j−+νij+⋅ν*j++πij−⋅π*j−+πij+⋅π*j+=0,μij−⋅μ#j−+μij+⋅μ#j++νij−⋅ν#j−+νij+⋅ν#j++πij−⋅π#j−+πij+⋅π#j+=0,πij−=1−μij+−νij+,πij+=1−μij−−νij−,π*j−=1−μ*j+−ν*j+,π*j+=1−μ*j−−ν*j−,π#j−=1−μ#j+−ν#j+,π#j+=1−μ#j−−ν#j−,μij−≤μ*j−,μij+≤μ*j+,νij−≥ν*j−,νij+≥ν*j+,μij−≥μ#j−,μij+≥μ#j+,νij−≤ν#j−,νij+≤ν#j+,0≤μij−≤μij+≤1,0≤νij−≤νij+≤1,0≤μ*j−≤μ*j+≤1,0≤ν*−≤ν*j+≤1,0≤μ#j−≤μ#j+≤1,0≤ν#j−≤ν#j+≤1.The above simultaneous equalities and inequalities can be solved to determine feasible solutions forA˜ij(=([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+],[πij−,πij+])),A˜*j(=([μ*j−,μ*j+],[ν*j−,ν*j+],[π*j−,π*j+])), andA˜#j(=([μ#j−,μ#j+],[ν#j−,ν#j+],[π#j−,π#j+])). The determination result contains a unique solution as follows:A˜ij=([0,0],[0,0],[1,1]),A˜*j=([1,1],[0,0],[0,0]), andA˜#j=([0,0],[1,1],[0,0]). Note that this result is unreasonable in practice because the evaluative rating of alternative ziwith respect to criterion xjis([0,0],[0,0],[1,1]). That is, the intervals of both the membership and non-membership degrees are equal to[0,0], and the hesitation interval relative toA˜ijis the highest (i.e.,[1,1]). This result implies that the performance for which ziis evaluated in terms of xjis totally unknown, and it is very rare and incredible in real-life decision situations. Thus, the condition ofA˜ij=([0,0],[0,0],[1,1])should be excluded to avoid abnormality in the evaluative ratings. Accordingly, it is reasonable to designateA˜ij≠([0,0],[0,0],[1,1])in defining the projection-based compromising index.Theorem 3The projection-based compromising indexPijfor eachzi∈Zandxj∈X, whereX=XI∪XII, satisfies the following properties:(T3.1)0≤Pij≤1;(T3.2)Pij=1if and only ifProjA˜*j(A˜ij)>0andProjA˜#j(A˜ij)=0forxj∈XIorProjA˜ij(A˜*j)>0andProjA˜ij(A˜#j)=0forxj∈XII;(T3.3)Pij=0if and only ifProjA˜*j(A˜ij)=0andProjA˜#j(A˜ij)>0forxj∈XIorProjA˜ij(A˜*j)=0andProjA˜ij(A˜#j)>0forxj∈XII.ProofSee Appendix C.Denote an IVIF numberW˜jas the importance weight of criterionxj∈X. LetPijbe the projection-based compromising index of the evaluative ratingA˜ijfor eachzi∈Zandxj∈X. The comprehensive compromising indexC˜iof alternative ziis defined as follows:The comprehensive compromising indexC˜iof eachzi∈Zis an IVIF number (denoted as(ςi,ζi,ξi)) and can be calculated in the following way:C˜i=(ςi,ζi,ξi)=([ςi−,ςi+],[ζi−,ζi+],[ξi−,ξi+])=([1−∏j=1n(1−ωj−)Pij,1−∏j=1n(1−ωj+)Pij],[∏j=1n(ϖj−)Pij,∏j=1n(ϖj+)Pij],[∏j=1n(1−ωj+)Pij−∏j=1n(ϖj+)Pij,∏j=1n(1−ωj−)Pij−∏j=1n(ϖj−)Pij]).(32)ProofSee Appendix D.As indicated in Theorem 4, the comprehensive compromising indexC˜iis an IVIF number. Because no natural linear orders exist among IVIF numbers, this paper employs a newly-developed measure introduced by Guo [17] to derive the comparable values of the comprehensive compromising indices among the m alternatives. To overcome some drawbacks and ambiguities in existing approaches via score functions, Guo [17] proposed a useful measure for ranking IVIF numbers based on amount of information using the geometrical representation of IVIF sets. Let Cidenotes the comprehensive compromising value of each alternativezi∈Z. Applying Guo’s proposal, Ciis defined as follows:(33)Ci=12[1−14(ξi−+ξi+)]⋅[ςi−+ςi++12(ξi−+ξi+)],where0≤Ci≤1. Note that the larger the value of Ci, the better the IVIF numberC˜iis. According to the descending order of Ci, the decision maker can determine the ranking order of all m alternatives and select the best one.Although the ranking order of all alternatives can be determined via comparisons of the comprehensive compromising values, more realistic information can be provided for the decision maker to consider the alternatives that are approved and preferred to recommend. The decision maker may not find any true meaning in the comprehensive compromising values. Thus, it may be convenient to compare the comprehensive compromising value of each alternative with the benchmark value. This paper uses the comprehensive compromising value of the positive-ideal solution z*relative to the negative-ideal solution z#for the comparison purpose.First, the projection-based comparative indexℙj*ofA˜*jrelative toA˜#jis computed as follows:(34)ℙj*={ProjA˜#j(A˜*j)ProjA˜#j(A˜*j)+ProjA˜*j(A˜#j)ifxj∈XI,ProjA˜*j(A˜#j)ProjA˜*j(A˜#j)+ProjA˜#j(A˜*j)ifxj∈XII.The comprehensive comparative indexℂ˜*(=(ς*,ζ*,ξ*)=([ς*−,ς*+],[ζ*−,ζ*+],[ξ*−,ξ*+])) of z*relative to z#is derived as follows:(35)ℂ˜*=⊕j=1nℙj*⋅W˜j=([1−∏j=1n(1−ωj−)ℙj*,1−∏j=1n(1−ωj+)ℙj*],[∏j=1n(ϖj−)ℙj*,∏j=1n(ϖj+)ℙj*],[∏j=1n(1−ωj+)ℙj*−∏j=1n(ϖj+)ℙj*,∏j=1n(1−ωj−)ℙj*−∏j=1n(ϖj−)ℙj*]).Next, the comprehensive comparative valueℂ˜*of z*relative to z#is calculated as follows:(36)ℂ*=12[1−14(ξ*−+ξ*+)]⋅[ς*−+ς*++12(ξ*−+ξ*+)].The comprehensive comparative valueℂ*can be deemed a benchmark value for the comparison purpose. Furthermore, let Ridenotes the improvement percentage of the comprehensive compromising value Cirelative to the benchmark valueℂ*for alternativezi∈Z; it is defined as follows:(37)Ri=Ci−ℂ*ℂ*⋅100%.In general, the preference of the alternative ziincreases when the improvement percentage Riincreases. Thus, in addition to the comprehensive compromising value Ci, the priority order of the m alternatives can be determined according to the descending order of Ri. Alternatively, the partial ranking order contains more realistic information that is useful for practical decision making. Specifically, ifRi≥0, the alternative zican be regarded as the better choice and is approved and preferred to recommend. In contrast, ifRi<0, the alternative ziis not approved to recommend.The proposed projection-based compromising method for addressing MCDA problems within the IVIF environment can be summarized in the following steps:Steps 1and 2: Problem formulationStep 1: Formulate an MCDA problem. Specify the alternative setZ={z1,z2,…,zm}and the criterion setX={x1,x2,…,xn}, which is divided into XI and XII.Step 2: Based on IVIF numbers, establish the evaluative ratingA˜ijin Eq.

(8) to calculate the projectionsProjA˜*j(A˜ij)andProjA˜#j(A˜ij)forzi∈Zwith respect toxj∈XI,ProjA˜ij(A˜*j)andProjA˜ij(A˜#j)forzi∈Zwith respect toxj∈XII, andProjA˜#j(A˜*j)andProjA˜*j(A˜#j)forxj∈X.Steps 6 and 7: Determination ofcompromising indicesStep 6: Establish the projection-based compromising and comparative indices.Step 6-1: Compute the projection-based compromising indexPijofA˜ijforzi∈Zwith respect toxj∈Xusing Eq.

(37), and rank the m alternatives according to the descending order of the Rivalues.Step 9: The alternatives withRi≥0belong to the better compromise choices that are approved and preferred to recommend. The alternatives withRi<0belong to the worse compromise choices that are not approved to recommend.This section illustrates the proposed projection-based compromising method by applying it to a practical MCDA problem concerning the selection of watershed sites for environmental watershed plans. This case originates from the watershed siting problem in Wang and Chen [40]. Furthermore, selected comparative discussions are conducted to validate the results of the proposed method with the results from other relevant MCDA methods.Considering a practical problem of selecting a watershed site, the authority’s assessments and judgments are inherently imprecise and involve many uncertainties due to the complicated circumstances inherent to the MCDA process during watershed environmental planning. Therefore, this paper uses IVIF sets to capture imprecise or uncertain practical information often observed with the problem of watershed site selection and employs the projection-based compromising method to rank candidate watershed sites.Based on interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Wang and Chen [40] developed a closeness coefficient-based decision-making method for handling MCDA problems in the context of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. They illustrated the feasibility and applicability of their proposed method using a practical problem of watershed site selection. The empirical study in Wang and Chen [40] assesses potential watershed sites that are suitable for environmental governance. In particular, four candidate watershed sites were selected for the assessment using eight criteria, including potential debris-flow torrents (x1), erosion and deposition by rivers (x2), soil and water conservation of roads (x3), activities of the biological community (x4), integrality of ecological corridors (x5), ecological monitoring and management (x6), landscape tourism and natural features (x7), and artificial disturbances (x8). The criteria x1, x2, and x8 denote cost criteria, whereas all others denote benefit criteria. The set of evaluative criteria is denoted byX={x1,x2,…,x8}withXI={x3,x4,…,x7}andXII={x1,x2,x8}. The set of all candidate sites is denoted byZ={z1,z2,z3,z4}. Here, Step 1 in the problem formulation stage has been already implemented.In Wang and Chen’s [40] empirical study, they adopted a nine-point linguistic rating scale to establish the evaluative ratings of the alternatives and importance weights of the criteria. The results of linguistic evaluations are shown in the right section of Table 2. Based on Step 2 in the proposed projection-based compromising method, these linguistic evaluations must be represented by IVIF numbers. Nevertheless, Wang and Chen [40] converted the linguistic evaluations into interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers because they addressed MCDA problems within the interval type-2 fuzzy environment. In contrast, this paper carries out MCDA in the IVIF context. With this regard, a useful nine-point linguistic transformation standard introduced by Chen [13] was employed to handle the data of linguistic evaluations. The IVIF numbers corresponding to each linguistic term are presented in the left section of Table 2. The evaluative ratingA˜ijand the importance weightW˜jcan then be acquired by converting the linguistic weights and ratings, respectively, into the corresponding IVIF numbers.In the stage of computing projections with ideal solutions, the evaluative ratings of the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions with respect to each criterion were first determined. Based on Step 3-1, the evaluative ratings of the positive-ideal solution z*in terms of criterionxj∈Xwere obtained as follows:A˜*1=([0.40, 0.45,0.45, 0.50,0.05, 0.15]),A˜*2=([0.25, 0.30,0.55, 0.60,0.10, 0.20]),A˜*3=([0.80, 0.85,0.05, 0.10,0.05, 0.15]),A˜*4=([0.80, 0.85,0.05, 0.10,0.05, 0.15]),A˜*5=([0.80, 0.85,0.05, 0.10,0.05, 0.15]),A˜*6=([0.50, 0.55,0.35, 0.40,0.05, 0.15]),A˜*7=([0.90, 0.95,0.02, 0.05,0.00, 0.08]),A˜*8=([0.02, 0.05,0.90, 0.95,0.00, 0.08]).In Step 3-2, the evaluative ratings of the negative-ideal solution z#with respect to criterionxj∈Xwere acquired as follows:A˜#1=([0.60, 0.65,0.25, 0.30,0.05, 0.15]),A˜#2=([0.70, 0.75,0.15, 0.20,0.05, 0.15]),A˜#3=([0.10, 0.15,0.70, 0.75,0.10, 0.20]),A˜#4=([0.10, 0.15,0.70, 0.75,0.10, 0.20]),A˜#5=([0.02, 0.05,0.90, 0.95,0.00, 0.08]),A˜#6=([0.10, 0.15,0.70, 0.75,0.10, 0.20]),A˜#7=([0.50, 0.55,0.35, 0.40,0.05, 0.15]),A˜#8=([0.60, 0.65,0.25, 0.30,0.05, 0.15]).Next, this study computedcos(A˜ij,A˜*j)andcos(A˜ij,A˜#j)forzi∈Zwith respect toxj∈Xandcos(A˜*j,A˜#j)(=cos(A˜#j,A˜*j)) forxj∈Xbased on Step 4. The results of the computation are depicted in Table 3. In Step 5, the calculated results of the relevant projections (i.e.,ProjA˜*j(A˜ij),ProjA˜#j(A˜ij),ProjA˜ij(A˜*j),ProjA˜ij(A˜#j),ProjA˜#j(A˜*j), andProjA˜*j(A˜#j)) are shown in Table 4.In the stage of determining compromising indices, this paper first calculated the projection-based compromising indexPijofA˜ijfor eachzi∈Zandxj∈Xbased on Step 6-1, and the results are presented in Table 5. Next, in Step 6-2, this paper derived the projection-based comparative indexℙj*ofA˜*jrelative toA˜#jforxj∈X. The calculated results are depicted in the last column of Table 5.In Step 7-1, the comprehensive compromising indices forzi∈Zwere determined as follows:C˜1=([0.9921, 0.9970,0.0003, 0.0015,0.0015, 0.0076]),C˜2=([0.9854, 0.9936,0.0009, 0.0032,0.0032, 0.0137]),C˜3=([0.9798, 0.9905,0.0016, 0.0049,0.0046, 0.0186]),C˜4=([0.9786, 0.9903,0.0016, 0.0054,0.0043, 0.0198]).Moreover, the comprehensive comparative indexℂ˜*=([0.9842, 0.9933], [0.0010, 0.0036], [0.0031, 0.0148]). Next, in Step 7-2, the comprehensive compromising values forzi∈Zwere calculated as follows:C1=0.9946,C2=0.9895,C3=0.9852, andC4=0.9845. Additionally, the comprehensive comparative valueℂ*=0.9888. Note that if the authority would like to rank the candidate sites from the best to the weakest one, the comprehensive compromising values can be directly applied to build a complete ranking order on Z.Based on Step 8 in the stage of ranking alternatives, this paper computed the improvement percentage Riof Cirelative toℂ*forzi∈Z, and the results are as follows:R1=0.5866%,R2=0.0708%,R3=−0.3641%, andR4=−0.4349%. Thus, the ranking order of the four candidate watershed sites isz1≻z2≻z3≻z4becauseR1>R2>R3>R4, which is similar to that obtained using the closeness coefficient-based decision-making method of Wang and Chen [40].Finally, in Step 9, the approval status of each candidate watershed site can be determined according to the corresponding improvement percentages. BecauseR1≥0andR2≥0, z1 and z2 belong to the better compromise choices, and their assessment status is “approved and preferred to recommend”. In contrast, becauseR3<0andR4<0, z3 and z4 belong to the worse compromise choices, and their assessment status is “not approved to recommend”. Combining the ranking order obtained by Step 8 and the assessment status of each alternative, the final priority order of the four candidate watershed sites is{z1≻z2}≻{z3≻z4}. Accordingly, the feasibility and applicability of the projection-based compromising method was validated by the analysis of the problem of watershed site selection. Additionally, the computation efficiency of the proposed method is high. Observe that the CPU time to solve the problem of watershed site selection was only 0.005958s, in which the proposed method was solved using MATLAB and simultaneously run on an x64-based PC with an Intel Core i7-2600K (3.4 GHz) CPU, 16 G of RAM, and the Windows 7 Professional operating system (see computer codes in the electronic Supplementary material for details). The computations associated with the proposed method are simple and effective in virtue of low computational complexity.This subsection conducts some comparative analyses with other relevant compromising methods to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The comparative approaches include the extended TOPSIS method, the extended VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (i.e., multicriteria optimization and compromise solution) (VIKOR) method, and the reduced version of the proposed methodology with fixed ideal solutions.Over the past few decades, the most traditionally representative method of the compromising models in the field of MCDA is the TOPSIS method. Additionally, the VIKOR method [32,33] is one of the commonly used compromising methods for improving the quality of MCDA. Thus, this paper choses the TOPSIS and VIKOR methods as the first two comparative approaches because the proposed method belongs to the compromising models. Nevertheless, the classical TOPSIS and VIKOR methods cannot directly handle IVIF data in MCDA problems within the environment of IVIF sets. Accordingly, in the first two comparative studies, an extended TOPSIS method and an extended VIKOR method were presented by extending the core concepts of TOPSIS and VIKOR, respectively, to the IVIF context.In the first comparative study, letA˜ijW,A˜*jWandA˜#jWdenote the weighted evaluative ratings of the alternativezi∈Z, the positive-ideal solution z*, and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively, with respect to criterionxj∈X, whereA˜ijW=W˜j⊗A˜ij,A˜*jW=W˜j⊗A˜*j, andA˜#jW=W˜j⊗A˜#j. They are computed in the following manner:(38)A˜ijW=(μijW,νijW,πijW)=([μijW−,μijW+],[νijW−,νijW+],[πijW−,πijW+])=([ωj−⋅μij−,ωj+⋅μij+],[ϖj−+νij−−ϖj−⋅νij−,ϖj++νij+−ϖj+⋅νij+],[1−ωj+⋅μij+−ϖj+−νij++ϖj+⋅νij+,1−ωj−⋅μij−−ϖj−−νij−+ϖj−⋅νij−]),(39)A˜*jW=(μ*jW,ν*jW,π*jW)=([μ*jW−,μ*jW+],[ν*jW−,ν*jW+],[π*jW−,π*jW+])=([ωj−⋅μ*j−,ωj+⋅μ*j+],[ϖj−+ν*j−−ϖj−⋅ν*j−,ϖj++ν*j+−ϖj+⋅ν*j+],[1−ωj+⋅μ*j+−ϖj+−ν*j++ϖj+⋅ν*j+,1−ωj−⋅μ*j−−ϖj−−ν*j−+ϖj−⋅ν*j−]),(40)A˜#jW=(μ#jW,ν#jW,π#jW)=([μ#jW−,μ#jW+],[ν#jW−,ν#jW+],[π#jW−,π#jW+])=([ωj−⋅μ#j−,ωj+⋅μ#j+],[ϖj−+ν#j−−ϖj−⋅ν#j−,ϖj++ν#j+−ϖj+⋅ν#j+],[1−ωj+⋅μ#j+−ϖj+−ν#j++ϖj+⋅ν#j+,1−ωj−⋅μ#j−−ϖj−−ν#j−+ϖj−⋅ν#j−]).In the TOPSIS methodology, the decision maker is assumed to prefer the alternatives that are closer to the positive-ideal solution and remoter from the negative-ideal solution [18]. The best compromise alternative is the solution that should be as close as possible to the positive-ideal solution and as far away from the negative-ideal solution as possible concurrently. Therefore, based on the generalized distance measures, the separation measures, Si* and Si#, between alternativezi∈Zand z*and z#, respectively, are derived from the following:(41)Si*=1n∑j=1n[14(|μijW−−μ*jW−|ψ+|μijW+−μ*jW+|ψ+|νijW−−ν*jW−|ψ+|νijW+−ν*jW+|ψ)]1ψ,(42)Si#=1n∑j=1n[14(|μijW−−μ#jW−|ψ+|μijW+−μ#jW+|ψ+|νijW−−ν#jW−|ψ+|νijW+−ν#jW+|ψ)]1ψ,where ψ is a distance parameter with1≤ψ≤∞. When ψ=1, Eqs. (41) and (42) reduce to the city block distances (also referred to as Manhattan distances). If ψ=2, then Eqs. (41) and (42) reduce to the Euclidean distances.According to the TOPSIS technique, the separation-based closeness coefficient SCiof alternativezi∈Zis defined as follows:(43)SCi=Si#Si*+Si#,where0≤SCi≤1. The priority order of alternative zican be obtained according to the descending order of SCi.Consider the watershed site selection problem. When the city block distance was employed (i.e., ψ=1), the separation-based closeness coefficients were determined as follows: SC1=0.6848, SC2=0.6115, SC3=0.4707, and SC4=0.4306. Furthermore, when the Euclidean distance was employed (i.e., ψ=2), the separation-based closeness coefficients were acquired as follows: SC1=0.6821, SC2=0.6124, SC3=0.4708, and SC4=0.4295. Therefore, the priority order of the four candidate watershed sites is:z1≻z2≻z3≻z4for both cases of the city block distance and the Euclidean distance. It is obvious that the result obtained using the proposed projection-based compromising method is consistent with the results of the extended TOPSIS method. The projection-based compromising method and the extended TOPSIS method originate from different theoretical bases. Nevertheless, the identical solution results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed algorithm and validate the effectiveness of the developed method.The second comparative approach is the extended VIKOR method. Consider the characteristicA˜*andA˜#of the positive-ideal solution z*and the negative-ideal solution z#, respectively, as shown in Eqs. (17) and (21). Let two IVIF numbersSS˜iandRS˜irepresent the average and the worst group IVIF scores, respectively, of the alternatives zi. They are defined as follows:(44)SS˜i=⊕j=1n(Si*jS*#j⋅W˜j),(45)RS˜i=maxj=1n(Si*jS*#j⋅W˜j),whereSi*jandS*#j, based on the separation measures, are computed as follows:(46)Si*j=14(|μij−−μ*j−|+|μij+−μ*j+|+|νij−−ν*j−|+|νij+−ν*j+|),(47)S*#j=14(|μ*j−−μ#j−|+|μ*j+−μ#j+|+|ν*j−−ν#j−|+|ν*j+−ν#j+|).The SSiand RSivalues ofSS˜iandRS˜i, respectively, can be computed using the measure proposed by Guo [17]. Next, compute the QSivalue for each alternativezi∈Zas follows:(48)QSi=υ⋅SSi−mini'=1mSSi′maxi′=1mSSi′−mini′=1mSSi′+(1−υ)⋅RSi−mini'=1mRSi′maxi′=1mRSi′−mini′=1mRSi′,whereυis considered as the weight for the strategy of the maximum group utility, and1−υis considered as the weight of the individual regret. The compromise solutions can be selected with “voting by majority” (υ>0.5), with “consensus” (υ=0.5), and with “veto” (υ<0.5). Three ranking lists can be obtained by sorting each SSi, RSi, and QSivalues in an increasing order, respectively.In the watershed site selection problem, we setυ=0.5to achieve the goal of “consensus.” The SSivalues were determined as follows: SS1=0.9707, SS2=0.9711, SS3=0.9953, and SS4=0.9747, whereas the ranking order of the four alternatives isz1≻z2≻z4≻z3. The RSivalues were acquired as follows: RS1=0.8313, RS2=0.8667, RS3=0.9261, and RS4=0.7363, whereas the ranking order of the alternatives isz4≻z1≻z2≻z3. The QSivalues were obtained as follows: QS1=0.2502, QS2=0.3533, QS3=1.0000, and QS4=0.0820, whereas the ranking order of the alternatives isz4≻z1≻z2≻z3. The ranking order using the QSivalues is the same as the ranking result using the RSivalues. However, the best choice z4 based on QSivalues has not an acceptable advantage becauseQS1−QS4<1/(4−1). Moreover, z4 does not satisfy the condition of the acceptable stability in decision making because it is not the best ranked in the ranking order based on SSivalues. According to the VIKOR decision rule, a set of compromise solutions (i.e., z4, z1, and z2) was determined becauseQS2−QS4<1/(4−1). Therefore, the final priority order of the four candidate watershed sites isz4∼z1∼z2≻z3that is significantly different from the ranking result yielded by the closeness coefficient-based decision-making method, the extended TOPSIS method for both cases of the city block distance and the Euclidean distance, and the proposed projection-based compromising method.The third comparative approach is the reduced version of the proposed methodology with fixed ideal solutions. With regard to anchored judgments with displaced ideals, this paper employs the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions to serve as points of reference. Moreover, the evaluative ratings of the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions with respect to criteria are directly generated from the characteristics of all alternatives. In contrast, numerous studies have incorporated the fixed ideal solutions as points of reference for addressing MCDA problems within the IVIF environment (e.g., Refs. [21,22,35,42]). Because the choice of appropriate anchors influences the intensity or even the rank order of the preferences [40], this paper investigates how displaced ideals and fixed ideals affect the ultimate choice in the third comparative analysis.In the IVIF context, letA˜′*jandA˜′#jdenote the evaluative ratings of the fixed positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutionsz′*andz′#, respectively, with respect to criterionxj∈X; they are defined as follows:(49)A˜′*j=(μ′*j,ν′*j,π′*j)=([μ′*j−,μ′*j+],[ν′*j−,ν′*j+],[π′*j−,π′*j+])=(([1,1],[0,0],[0,0]|xj∈XI),([0,0],[1,1],[0,0]|xj∈XII)),(50)A˜′#j=(μ′#j,ν′#j,π′#j)=([μ′#j−,μ′#j+],[ν′#j−,ν′#j+],[π′#j−,π′#j+])=(([0,0],[1,1],[0,0]|xj∈XI),([1,1],[0,0],[0,0]|xj∈XII)).It is obvious thatcos(A˜′*j,A˜′#j)=0andcos(A˜′#j,A˜′*j)=0for eachxj∈X. Accordingly, it follows thatProjA˜′#j(A˜′*j)=0andProjA˜′*j(A˜′#j)=0forxj∈X. Meanwhile, the projection-based comparative indexℙj*ofA˜*jrelative toA˜#jwill be meaningless becauseProjA˜′#j(A˜′*j)+ProjA˜′*j(A˜′#j)=0. Therefore, one has no need to determine the projection-based comparative indexℙj*and the comprehensive comparative indexℂ˜*when the reduced version of the proposed methodology with fixed ideal solutions is used. Additionally, instead of the improvement percentage Ri, the ranking order of the alternatives can be obtained via comparisons of the comprehensive compromising values.In the reduced version of the developed method, the projection-based compromising indexPijofA˜ij(≠([0,0],[0,0],[1,1])) is computed as follows:(51)Pij={ProjA˜′*j(A˜ij)ProjA˜′*j(A˜ij)+ProjA˜′#j(A˜ij)ifxj∈XI,ProjA˜ij(A˜*j)ProjA˜ij(A˜′*j)+ProjA˜ij(A˜′#j)ifxj∈XII.Next, the comprehensive compromising indexC˜iand the comprehensive compromising value Cican be acquired using Eqs. (32) and (33), respectively. Finally, the m alternatives can be ranked according to the descending order of the Civalues.When applying the reduced version of the proposed methodology with fixed ideal solutions to the watershed site selection problem, the comprehensive compromising indices were determined as follows:C˜1=([0.9932, 0.9975,0.0003, 0.0012,0.0013, 0.0065]),C˜2=([0.9867, 0.9941,0.0008, 0.0027,0.0032, 0.0125]),C˜3=([0.9716, 0.9852,0.0027, 0.0074,0.0074, 0.0257]),C˜4=([0.9804, 0.9913,0.0013, 0.0046,0.0041, 0.0183]).The comprehensive compromising values forzi∈Zwere computed as follows:C1=0.9954,C2=0.9904,C3=0.9785, andC4=0.9859. Therefore, the ranking order of the four candidate watershed sites isz1≻z2≻z4≻z3becauseC1>C2>C4>C3. This result is somewhat different from that obtained using the extended TOPSIS method and the proposed projection-based compromising method.Table 6presents the summary results of the comparison analyses concerning the MCDA problem of selecting watershed sites. Except the reduced version of the proposed methodology, all of the comparative methods employed the concept of displaced positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions to serve as points of reference. Nevertheless, determining the displaced ideal solutions would lead to complicated computations in the interval type-2 fuzzy context. To address this issue, Wang and Chen [40] defined the approximate positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions to replace the displaced ideal solutions. As shown in Table 6, the closeness coefficient-based decision-making method developed by Wang and Chen [40] yielded the ranking result ofz1≻z2≻z4≻z3within the interval type-2 fuzzy environment. This result is the same as that obtained by the reduced version of the proposed methodology. However, the data types used in the two methods are different. The linguistic evaluations were represented as interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in Wang and Chen [40]. In contrast, the linguistic evaluations were represented as IVIF numbers in the reduced method. Consider the other solution results in the IVIF context. The priority orderz1≻z2≻z3≻z4was obtained using the extended TOPSIS method separately based on the employment of the city block distance and the Euclidean distance. In contrast, the priority orderz4∼z1∼z2≻z3was obtained using the extended VIKOR method. Except the VIKOR result, the results yielded by the comparative methods coincide with the priority order{z1≻z2}≻{z3≻z4}determined by the proposed projection-based compromising method. Furthermore, compared with the extended VIKOR method, the proposed method yielded more credible ranking results that are in accordance with the rankings yielded by the other relevant compromising methods.Compared with the comparative methods, the proposed method has sufficient flexibility because of the complete ranking order and the approval status of the alternatives. According to the improvement percentage Rior the comprehensive compromising value Ci, the proposed method produced the complete ranking orderz1≻z2≻z3≻z4for the four candidate watershed sites. Furthermore, the approval status of each candidate site was obtained as well (i.e., z1 and z2 are approved and preferred to recommend, and z3 and z4 are not approved to recommend). More importantly, the proposed method was able to combine the complete ranking order and the assessment status to acquire the final priority order{z1≻z2}≻{z3≻z4}. Furthermore, if the fixed ideal solutions are employed as the points of reference, the proposed method can easily handle such issue via the reduced version of the proposed methodology with fixed ideal solutions. Alternately, according to the ranking result yielded by the extended VIKOR method, the decision maker can eliminate the less favorable alternative z3 only. The extended VIKOR outranking procedure is not able to differentiate the priority orders of three alternatives z4, z1, and z2. Thus, the employment of the proposed method provides more influential information than the employment of the extended VIKOR method for decision support.In the case of a ranking problem, the decision maker has to rank the alternative from the best to the worst one. The proposed method develops an effective approach to building a complete ranking order on the alternative set Z via comparisons of the values of Rior Ci. In the case of a choice problem, the decision maker would like to select the best alternative in Z. However, in general, there is no best solution in an MCDA problem because all of the alternatives in Z are non-inferior solutions. Accordingly, the choice problem will be to obtain a set of relatively good alternatives from Z. The proposed method provides a simple approach for investigating the better alternatives via the determination of the assessment status. On the whole, the comparison of results from the practical application of watershed site selection demonstrated the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method has the ability to adapt to real decision-making situations and solve ranking or choice problems for MCDA.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper employed the concept of projections to define a projection-based compromising index and a comprehensive compromising index for constructing a new compromising decision-making method within the IVIF decision environment. Overall, this paper makes several significant contributions to the existing literature on MCDA methods, especially the compromising models, based on IVIF sets. First, this paper proposed new useful concepts of projection-based compromising indices and comprehensive compromising indices to combine the proximity to the positive-ideal solution and the remoteness from the negative-ideal solution, which is different from classical compromising decision-making methods. Moreover, this paper investigated some essential properties of the projections of the evaluative ratings for an alternative on the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions and developed important theorems to support the effectiveness of the proposed compromising indices. Second, this paper employed the concepts of projection-based comparative indices and comprehensive comparative indices to define the benchmark values for the comparison purpose. To get an understanding of the true meaning in the comprehensive compromising indices, this paper used the projection-based comparative index and the comprehensive comparative index for comparing the comprehensive compromising values that are defined by a newly-developed measure. Third, a new approach to determining the priority orders of the alternatives was established by using the improvement percentage of the comprehensive compromising value instead of widely-used closeness coefficients in classical compromising decision-making methods. The proposed approach can provide more valuable information consisting of the complete ranking order of the alternatives for a ranking problem and the approval status of the alternatives for a choice problem. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed projection-based compromising method were validated using a practical application concerning the selection of watershed sites. The application result demonstrated that the developed method is recommended for addressing MCDA problems with IVIF information and has the potential for use in practical applications. In summary, compared with the past compromising decision-making methods in the IVIF context, the approach in this paper is more intuitive and effective in acquiring the priority orders of the alternatives and offering realistic information about the better choices that are approved and preferred to recommend.The projection used in our projection-based compromising method is merely a scalar, and thus it can simplify the computation procedure of the proposed approach. In future studies, if the decision maker attempts to consider the employment of interval-valued projections within the IVIF decision environment, one can modify the definition in Eq. (8) based on an extension of projections between intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Consider two IVIF numbersA˜x(=(μA˜(x),νA˜(x),πA˜(x))) andB˜x(=(μB˜(x),νB˜(x),πB˜(x))) in Definition 4. The maximal and minimal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers corresponding toA˜xareA˜x+(=(μA˜+(x),νA˜−(x),1−μA˜+(x)−νA˜−(x))) andA˜x−(=(μA˜−(x),νA˜+(x),1−μA˜−(x)−νA˜+(x))), respectively. Similarly, the maximal and minimal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers corresponding toB˜xareB˜x+(=(μB˜+(x),νB˜−(x),1−μB˜+(x)−νB˜−(x))) andB˜x−(=(μB˜−(x),νB˜+(x),1−μB˜−(x)−νB˜+(x))), respectively. Referring to the definition of projections in the intuitionistic fuzzy context [47,49], we can compute the projectionsProjB˜x−(A˜x+)andProjB˜x+(A˜x−). Then, the interval-valued projection ofA˜xonB˜xcan be determined by[ProjB˜x+(A˜x−),ProjB˜x−(A˜x+)]. Future research can focus on the discussion of possible definitions of interval-valued projections and the development of an extended MCDA method based on interval-valued projections.
