In a recent paper by Li and Cheng [Li,S.K., Cheng, Y.S., 2007. Solving the puzzles of structural efficiency. European Journal of Operational Research 180(2), 713–722], they developed the shadow price model to solve the existing puzzles of structural efficiency theoretically. However, we observe that the optimal shadow price vector in the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007) is not always unique. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency is arbitrarily generated, depending on the shadow price vector we choose. Finally, an example with multiple inputs and outputs is used to illustrate the phenomenon.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In his seminal paper, Farrell (1957) suggested that the “structural efficiency” could be measured by an output-weighted average of the technical efficiencies of its constituent production units. Forsund and Hjalmarsson (1979) criticized that the result of the weighted scheme does not have a straight-forward interpretation. They suggested that the “structural efficiency” of a group should be measured by calculating the technical efficiency of an average unit. However, Ylvinger (2000) pointed out that this approach had led to inconsistent measures and confusing findings. He proposed a new weighted average method, which used DEA to compute weights for the averaging process to measure the “structural efficiency” of a group. Nevertheless, any weighting scheme is difficult to justify by itself, particularly if the weights are endogenous (Leleu and Briec, 2009). Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) developed theoretical justification and the multi-output generalization for Farrell’s efficiency framework.Recently, Li and Cheng (2007) identified three puzzles in the existing studies of “structural efficiency” and developed the shadow price model to solve these puzzles theoretically. They defined shadow price vector as the gradient vector of the group output set at the structurally efficient aggregate output vector and used the shadow price vector to decompose the structural efficiency into three meaningful components. However, we observe that the shadow price vector in the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007) is not always unique. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency is arbitrarily generated, depending on the shadow price vector, which leads to the confusing interpretation of the economic meaning of its three components.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007). In Section 3, the non-uniqueness of the shadow price vector is presented and tested. A numerical example is provided in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5.We assume that there are n DMUs in the group. Each DMU consumes m inputs to produce r outputs. For each DMUj(j=1,…,n), we denote the input and the output vectors as (xj,yj), respectively, where xj=(x1j,…,xmj) and yj=(y1j,…,yrj).The production technology of DMU j is defined by the production possibility set: Tj={(x,y):x can produce y}. Equivalently, the technology can be characterized by its output set: Pj(x)={y:(x,y)∈Tj}.We denote the sum of the input and output vectors of n DMUS in the group as(Xo,Yo)=∑j-1n(xj,yj). Then the group technology set isTg={(X,Y):Xcan produceY}=∑j=1nTj, i.e., it is the sum of the individual technology of all DMUs in this group. An alternative characterization is given by the output set of Tgis Pg(X)={Y:(X,Y)∈Tg} (Nesterenko and Zelenyuk, 2007).Following the logic of Li and Cheng (2007), the output-oriented structural efficiency measure of the group is H∗=maxθ{θ:θYo∈Pg(Xo)}. The gradient vector of the group output set at Y∗(=H∗Yo), p is called the shadow price vector. It has the characteristic that p·Y∗=max{p·Y:Y∈Pg(Xo)}.The individual technical efficiency of the jth DMU is, following Farrell (1957), tej=maxδ{δ:δyj∈Pj(xj)}. A DMU with tej=1 produces on the frontier of the input requirement set and is technical efficient. Accordingly, the corresponding technically efficient output vector is tej·yjand the aggregate output vector for all DMUS as a whole isYte=∑j=1ntej·yj.Given the shadow price vector for each DMU, we get the revenue efficiency rej=maxy{(p·y)/(p·yj):(xj,y)∈Tj} of DMU j, and the corresponding revenue efficient output vector isyj∗. Thus, the aggregate output vector isYre=∑j=1nyj∗when all the DMUS are technically and allocatively efficient.The aggregate output-oriented technical efficiency isATE=p·Ytep·Yo, which measures the potential revenue gain if the technical inefficiency of all individual DMUs is eliminated. The aggregate output allocative efficiency measure, which indicates the potential revenue gain for the correctly-chosen output mixes, is defined asAAE=p·Yrep·Yte. The aggregate revenue re-allocative efficiency isRE=p·(H∗·Yo)p·Yre, which indicates the potential revenue gain when the inputs can be reallocated among the DMUs.Li and Cheng (2007) decomposed the structural efficiency H∗ into three components to interpret the meaning of structural efficiency: the aggregate technical efficiency, the aggregate allocative efficiency and re-allocative efficiency components: H∗=ATE·AAE·RE. Note, however, in doing so, they have to assume that the shadow price vector is unique.In the preceding section, the output-oriented structural efficiency measure of the group is H∗=maxθ{θ:θYo∈Pg(Xo)}. As Tjis a convex set and Tj=T(which we assume is the same for all the DMUs) forj=1,…,n,Tg=∑j=1nTj=∑j=1nT=nT. In the shadow price model, the gradient vector of the group output set at Y∗(=H∗Yo), p is called the shadow price vector.Following Lozano and Villa (2004) and Mar-Molinero et al. (2012), the shadow price vector p can be calculated by the following model:(1)Min∑i=1mvi·Xo+n·ζs.t.∑k=1rpk·Yo=1∑i=1mvi·xij-∑k=1rpk·ykj+ζ⩽0j=1,2,…,nvi⩾εi=1,2,…,mpk⩾εk=1,2,…,rζunrestricted in signwhere pkis the shadow price of output k, and p= (p1,…,pr). ε is a non-Archimedean element smaller than any positive real number. viis the weight to be determined for input i. ζ is the variable returns to scale auxiliary variable. In addition, the above model (1) is equivalent to the output-oriented BCC DEA model analyzing the average unit (Asmild et al., 2009; Fang, 2013).However, we observe that there is no guarantee for the uniqueness of the shadow price vector p by model (1). In order to judge whether the shadow price vector p in model 1 has multiple solutions, the following procedure is executed. The optimal solution to model 1 is denoted byv1∗,…,vm∗,p∗,ζ∗. First of all, two classes of additional constraints are added to model 1 respectively as follows:(2)pk⩾pk∗+εor(3)pk⩽pk∗-εwhere k=1,2,…,r, ε>0 is a small tolerance parameter. When the constraint (2) is added to model 1, we denote it by model 2. Obviously, the feasible regions of model 2 become smaller than that of model 1. Further, if model 2 is solved, the optimal value is the same as that of model 1, then it follows that another optimal solution to model 1, which satisfies pk>pk∗, is obtained. If the optimal value to model 2 is larger than that of model 1, it means that (1) has no optimal solution satisfying pk>pk∗. When the constraint (3) is added to model 1, we denote it by model 3. Following the same procedure, whether model 1 has an optimal solution satisfying pk<pk∗ can be judged. The following algorithm is presented to determine whether the shadow price vector p in model 1 has multiple solutions.Algorithm 1Step 1 k=1Step 2 Solve model 2. If the optimal value is the same as that of model 1, then turn to step 5; otherwise, turn to step 3.Step 3 Solve model 3. If the optimal value is the same as that of model 1, then turn to step 5; otherwise, turn to Step 4;Step 4 If k=r, then the shadow price vector p in model 1 has a unique solution. Otherwise, set pk=pk∗ and k←k+1, return to Step 2.Step 5 The shadow price vector p in model 1 has multiple solutions.Note that the number of variables involved in models 2 and 3 will be decreased by 1 as the index k increases by 1, which makes the cost of computation economical.We shall illustrate the above phenomenon using a simple data set consisting of eight DMUs, which consume one input to produce two outputs. The input and output data are provided in Table 1.The structural efficiency of the group is H∗=maxθ{θ:θYo∈Pg(Xo)}=1.4545. According to Algorithm 1, we judge that the shadow price vector p for this example has multiple solutions. For example, p1∈[0.0101,0.02275] and p2∈[0.007625,0.02025] are the optimal shadow prices.In the following section, an example in a multiple input and output case shows that the non-uniqueness of the multiple shadow price vector leads to the result that the decomposition of the structural efficiency varies considerably.In this section, we provide a numerical example with multiple inputs and outputs to illustrate the phenomenon. We assume that the group has 20 DMUs, each consuming two inputs to generate two outputs. Table 2shows the input and output dataset for 20 DMUs.The structural efficiency of the group is H∗=maxθ{θ:θYo∈Pg(Xo)}=1.5. Using model (1), p1∈[ε,0.0119] and p2∈[ε,0.00676] are the optimal shadow prices. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency can be arbitrarily generated, depending on the shadow price vector we choose. For example, if we selectp1p2=ε0.00676as the optimal shadow vector, the structural efficiency can be decomposed into the three components using the specific shadow price vector: H∗=ATE·AAE·RE (1.5=1.144·1.006·1.304). If we selectp1p2=0.0119εas the optimal shadow vector, the structural efficiency can be decomposed into the three components: H∗=ATE·AAE·RE (1.5=1.131·1.216·1.090). Thus, the decomposition of the structural efficiency varies considerably, depending on the shadow price vector we choose. The multiple decompositions of the structural efficiency lead to the confusing interpretation of the economic meaning of its three components.
