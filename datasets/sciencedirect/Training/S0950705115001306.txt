@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the past decade, the study of complex networks has attracted many researchers from various academic fields [1], such as Aviation Networks [2], Electricity Networks [3], Social Networks [4–6], Biological Networks [7]. By collecting the data of internet, social networks, biological networks, communication networks, electricity networks and other complex systems, scholars study actual cases to analyze the statistical characteristics [8,9] and the dynamic behaviors of networks [10–12]. Results show that the statuses of nodes in actual complex networks are unequal and evidently different. Moreover, the effects of nodes on the network survival performance are diverse from each other [13–15]. Therefore, it is a major research to evaluate the node importance in actual complex networks and find the outstanding nodes [16,17].Wang and Zhang [18] and He et al. [19] have introduced several commonly used network centrality indicators, and pointed out their characteristics and application scopes. Sun and Luo [20] provided a thorough introduction to domestic and foreign research on the evaluation of node importance in network public opinion, summarized the evaluation models and methods, and analyzed their respective characteristics based on network topology and node attribute. Liu et al. [21] also presented a literature review of previous research on the ranking methods of node importance from network structure and epidemic dynamic perspective, and introduced the recent survey. Ren and Lü [22] systematically reviewed more than 30 representative methods of ranking nodes in complex networks which are classified into four categories, compared them from the aspects of computing ideas and application scenarios, and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each method. In recent years, Carmi et al. [23,24] proposed a new idea that the node importance throughout the network depends on their locations, and they presented a new indicator to evaluate node importance by K-shell decomposition with low time complexity.This paper essentially studies a multi-attribute ranking problem to evaluate the node importance comprehensively from more than one perspective, which would be a special case of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). MCDM refers to making decision for alternatives in the presence of multiple and conflicting criteria [25–27], and has many developments and applications, such as extensions of TOPSIS [28,29], fuzzy TOPSIS [30,31], fuzzy MCDM [32,33], and hybrid MCDM approaches [34,35].This article is organized as follows: in Section 2, four node importance indicators are defined from the perspective of local attributes, global attributes, epidemic dynamic and network location, respectively. The advantages and disadvantages of each indicator are analyzed, and their applicable scopes are also discussed. Besides, a new indicator is put forward on the basis of K-shell decomposition, named improved K-shell. In Section 3, we propose a multi-attribute ranking method based on TOPSIS to evaluate the node importance comprehensively. In Section 4, the effectiveness of our method is verified by two actual complex networks, namely Shanxi Water Network and Beijing Subway Network. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 5.Given an undirected networkG=〈V,E,M〉, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 4(b),V={vi|i∈I}stands for the set of nodes andI={1,2,…,N},E={eij=(vi,vj)|i,j∈I}⊆V×Vis the set of edges.Ndenotes the number of network nodes,M=(mij)n×nis the adjacency matrix of the network andmijis defined as follows:(1)mij=1,(vi,vj)∈E0,(vi,vj)∉E(2)DCi=di/(N-1)Degree Centrality is defined as the ratio of the number of real edges to the maximum number of possible edges associated with nodevi, namelyDCi, wherediis the degree of nodevi.DCishows the ability of nodevito communicate with other nodes directly. The larger the valueDCiis, the more important nodeviis.Assumelijis the length of the shortest path from nodevito nodevj. The closeness centrality of nodevican be expressed as the reciprocal of the total length of the shortest paths from nodevito all the other nodes in the network, and the equation is as follows:(3)CCi=(N-1)∑j=1NlijThe larger the valueCCiis, the closer nodevilies to the network center, which indicates that nodevioccupies an important position in the network.(4)BCi=∑i≠j≠r∈Vkjr(i)kjrkjris the number of the shortest paths from nodevjto nodevrin the network,kjr(i)is the number of the shortest paths that travel through nodevi. The betweenness centrality of a node is defined as its load capacity between other nodes. And the larger the valueBCiis, the greater nodeviinfluences the network.K-shell decomposition is recursively to remove the nodes whose degrees are less than or equal tokand the removed nodes get theirKsvalues simultaneously [23,24]. DenoteS=(G,E|G)is an induced sub-network ofGby K-shell decomposition,Sis called thek-core ofGif and only if the degrees of all the nodes inSare greater thankandSis the largest sub-network. The sub-network constituted by the nodes whoseKsvalue is equal tokis called thek-shell ofG. A schematic diagram of K-shell decomposition is shown as Fig. 1(a), the network is divided into 3 different shells, withKs=1,Ks=2andKs=3, respectively. Also each node gets aKsvalue.In the next, we will propose the improved K-shell decomposition indicator. Assuming that the initial network isG0, first find the nodes whose degrees are minimal inG0and define theirIKsvalue asKs1=1, then get a new induced sub-networkG1by removing those nodes inG0. Similarly, find the nodes whose degrees are minimal inG1and define theirIKsvalue asKs2=Ks1+1, repeat sequentially and recursively until all the nodes have been removed. If the degree of a node becomes 0 in thekth removal, then define itsIKsvalue as(k+1). Each node can get a uniqueIKsvalue by Improved K-shell decomposition, as shown in Fig. 1(b).As shown in Fig. 1(b), the network in Fig. 1(a) can be divided into 6 different shells by Improved K-shell decomposition, which gives a more precise distinction of local characteristic differences between nodes than K-shell decomposition.It is a one-sided way to evaluate the node importance by only one certain indicator in actual complex networks. Therefore, in order to come to a more comprehensive and objective evaluation of the node importance, this paper proposes a multi-attribute ranking method according to the above indicators based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Object (TOPSIS).Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Object (TOPSIS) was proposed by Yoon et al. [25], which could be used to evaluate the importance of objects according to their close degree to the ideal object. If one object is the closest to the positive ideal object and the most away from the negative one, it would be the optimal object, and vice versa.In this paper, each node is an evaluation object and their importance can be evaluated by four indicators, namelyDC,CC,BCandIKs. It is a multi-attribute ranking problem to evaluate the node importance comprehensively, which can be studied on the basis of TOPSIS.The nodes in actual complex networks can be expressed asV={v1,v2,…,vN},and the set of evaluation indicators can be expressed asF={f1,f2,f3,f4}={DC,CC,BC,IKs}. Then,vi(fj)(i=1,2,…,N;j=1,2,3,4)means thejth indicator of nodevi, and the attribute matrix of nodes isP:(5)P=v1(f1)v1(f2)v1(f3)v1(f4)v2(f1)v2(f2)v2(f3)v2(f4)⋮⋮⋮⋮vN(f1)vN(f2)vN(f3)vN(f4)Because each indicator has different scales, the attribute matrix of nodes should be standardized into a normalized matrix, whose elementstijare defined as below.(6)tij=vi(fj)∑i=1Nvi(fj)2,(j=1,2,3,4)Suppose the weight coefficient of thejth indicator iswj(j=1,2,3,4;∑wj=1), the normalized matrix can be reconstructed by weight vectorWTand normalized matrixT=(tij)N×4.(7)R=(rij)=(wjtij)=w1t11w2t12w3t13w4t14w1t21w2t22w3t23w4t24⋮⋮⋮⋮w1tN1w2tN2w3tN3w4tN4Moreover,WT=wDCwCCwBCwIKsis calculated by using Analytic Hierarchy Process as follows.(1)Construct a comparison matrix of the indicatorsCompared with other indicators,DCis a local characteristic of the node and reflects little information of the network structure, soDCis the least important. It is difficult to compare the merits ofBCandCC, because the former incarnates the global connectivity of the node in the network, while the latter gives an expression to the center feature of the node. Therefore, this paper makesBCandCCequally important. WhileIKsnot only reflects the global features of network, but also distinguishes the local differences of nodes very well,IKsis set to be the most important indicator (see Tables 1 and 2).(8)CV=(cvij)=2,indicatoriis more important than indicatorj,1,indicatoriand indicatorjare equally important,0,indicatoriis less important than indicatorj.(2)Determine the judgment matrix [39,40](3)Check consistencyThe largest eigenvalue isλmax=∑i=14di4w¯i=4, andD=(di)4×1=C×W¯,pcl=λmax-44-1=0, which satisfies the complete consistency. Besides, the relevant weight coefficients of the indicators areWT=0.06250.18750.18750.5625.The positive ideal objectA∗and negative ideal objectA-are determined based on matrixR.(10a)A∗=max{ri1}i∈{1,2,…,N},…,max{ri4}i∈{1,2,…,N}=r1∗,…,r4∗(10b)A-=min{ri1}i∈{1,2,…,N},…,min{ri4}i∈{1,2,…,N}=r1-,…,r4-(1) Calculate the distance to the ideal objectA∗andA-for each evaluation nodeAibased on Euclidean Distance, namely TOPSIS-ED.(11a)Si∗=∑j=14(rij-rj∗)2(11b)Si-=∑j=14(rij-rj-)2(2) The calculation scheme above cannot distinguish the importance of the nodes, whose indicator values are located on the perpendicular bisector of the connecting line betweenA∗andA-. Therefore, this paper proposes a new scheme to calculate the distance by combining Relative Entropy and TOPSIS [41], namely TOPSIS-RE.(12a)Si∗=∑j=14rj∗logrj∗rij+(1-rj∗)log1-rj∗1-rij1/2(12b)Si-=∑j=14rj-logrj-rij+(1-rj-)log1-rj-1-rij1/2Calculate the close degree toA∗andA-for each evaluation nodeAias the next formula.(13)Ci∗=Si-Si∗+Si-,i=1,2,⋯,NThe greaterCi∗is, the more important the evaluation node is. The evaluation nodes can be sorted by the value ofCi∗. IfCi∗=0, the node is the least important andAi=A-. Otherwise, the one is the most important andAi=A∗whenCi∗=1.See Fig. 2.As shown in Fig. 3(a), Shanxi water network is designed as a multi-source framework of hydraulic engineering, which overall has two longitudinal and ten horizontal trunk streams. The Yellow River north main stream and Fenhe River, make the six main rivers in Shanxi inter-connected with each other and run across almost all over the province, from east to west and south to north. The Yellow River main stream is the water source, and Fenhe River is the water channel. Besides, medium- and large-scale water storage projects and spring water are the water nodes. Sanggan River and Hutuo River, etc. are the east–west water channels in the project. The entire water project contains natural rivers, constructed reservoirs, diversion projects, water supply projects, irrigation projects and hydro-power projects, etc. All of these constitute a complex water conservancy network.In this paper, we mainly study the network topology of Shanxi Water Resource Project without considering the direction of water flow, which could be abstracted as an undirected network (Fig. 3(b)). Natural rivers, artificial drainage systems and distribution works, etc. are network connections. Confluences of natural rive, hydro-junction projects, water control and treatment projects, etc. are network nodes. Besides, water is the flow and the nodes of Shanxi Water Network are numbered 1–82.Beijing Subway is the first urban rail transport system in China, which was planned in 1953 and established in 1969 [42]. As of January 2014, Beijing subway system covers 11 municipal districts of Beijing by 17 operation lines, which are composed of 16 subway lines, an airport rail and 273 subway stations (Fig. 4(a)). The total operating mileage is expected to be 660km or more by the end of 2016 and more than 1000km in 2020.In order to extract the network topology of Beijing subway system, the stations are regarded as network nodes, the lines between stations are abstracted into network edges, and passengers are flows in subway network (Fig. 4(b)). Hence, there are a total of 235 nodes numbered 1–235.Calculate the node importance in Shanxi Water Network and Beijing Subway Network according to the indicatorsDC,CC,BC,KsandIKs. Then standardize the calculation results by formula (6) and sort the results in descending order, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively.Firstly, the node importance in Shanxi Water Network and Beijing Subway Network are different from each other because of the different values ofCC. ButCConly presents one perspective of node importance.Secondly, the sort results ofDCis a ladder-shape with 5 steps, and the overall width of the steps is incremental in Shanxi Water Network. The results in Beijing Subway Network are also a ladder-shape with 1 very wide step. It can be seen that the node importance cannot be distinguished well only byDC.Thirdly, the sort results ofBCas a whole are relatively smooth, and the distribution of the value is from 0 to 1 in both Shanxi Water Network and Beijing Subway Network. ButBConly reflects one perspective of node importance.Besides, takeKsto sort the results of node importance and obtain two categories, which are too crude to do an in-depth analysis of the node importance in Shanxi Water Network and Beijing Subway Network. However,IKsgreatly improves the sort results ofKs. But there are still 2 wide steps in Shanxi Water Network and 1 wide step in Beijing Subway Network, which are hardly conducive to analyze the node importance comprehensively.From the above analysis, there are significant limitations to evaluate the node importance in actual complex networks by only one indicator.The multi-attribute ranking method based on TOPSIS is used to make a comprehensive evaluation of the node importance in actual complex networks, and the sort results are presented in descending order, as shown in Figs. 6(a) and (b), respectively.The sort results obtained by TOPSIS-RE and TOPSIS-ED are very similar, but the former can do better than the latter in distinguishing the node importance, such as the importance of the nodes between the 24th and 42th in Fig. 6(a), and the nodes between the 25th and the 135th in Fig. 6(b).The Euclidean distances between the network nodes could have relatively large differences, but their importance is often little different, which makes the overall treads of the two sort lines in Fig. 6 go very similarly, and the rankings of nodes according to their importance by TOPSIS-RE and TOPSIS-ED coincide quite well globally and locally, although there is only some fluctuation in part of nodes in Fig. 7.In order to evaluate how well a system works before and after a set of nodes being attacked, we use the global efficiency of the network, which is defined as the average of the efficiency over all couples of nodes [43].(14)EF(G)=∑i∈G,i≠jεijN(N-1)=1N(N-1)∑i∈G,i≠j1lij,(15a)fi=EF(Gi)EF(G0),(i=1,2,…,5),(15b)Δfi1=fi-f1,(i=2,3,…,5),wherelijis the length of the shortest path from nodevito nodevj. The global efficiency of the network is defined asEF(G0)without being attacked,EF(G1)after being attacked by the rankings of TOPSIS-RE,EF(G2)after being attacked Randomly,EF(G3)after being attacked by the rankings of TOPSIS-ED,EF(G4)after being attacked by the rankings of the method in Ref. [44], andEF(G5)after being attacked by the rankings of the method in Ref. [45].The values offi,(i=1,2,…,5)(e.g., Figs. 8(a), 10(a)) andΔfi1,(i=2,3,…,5)(e.g., Figs. 8(b), 10(b)) change with the number of nodes being attacked.Shanxi Water Network is attacked by removing its important nodes by the rankings of five different methods. As shown in Table 3and Fig. 8, the global efficiency of Shanxi Water Network obtains the largest decline with our method TOPSIS-RE. After the first 6 important nodes being attacked, our method gets about 40.3%, 33.2%, 27.9% and 33.2% improvement compared with Randomly, TOPSIS-ED, and the methods in Refs. [44,45].Attack the important nodes and connected edges of Shanxi Water Network by the rankings of TOPSIS-RE and obtain the induced network as shown in Fig. 9. According to the planning and construction information of Shanxi Water Resource Project [46], the first 6 nodes being attacked are the emergency water supply projects, and the “two longitudinal and ten horizontal” framework is coming to break down after the first 12 nodes being attacked. The connectivity between local networks has been destroyed by attacking the first 24 nodes, and there would only leave isolated reservoirs in Shanxi Water Network if the first 42 nodes are attacked.Beijing Subway Network is attacked by removing the important stations by the rankings of five different methods. As shown in Table 4and Fig. 10, the global efficiency of Beijing Subway Network gets the largest decline with our method TOPSIS-RE. After the first 15 important stations being attacked, our method gets about 32.9%, 7.4%, 2.0% and 18.1% improvement compared with Randomly, TOPSIS-ED, and the methods in Refs. [44,45].The top 25 most important stations of Beijing Subway Network obtained by TOPSIS-RE are shown in Table 5. According to the developing history of Beijing Subway [47], the top 10 stations belong to Beijing Subway Line 1 and Line 2 which are the earliest established subway lines in Beijing with a very large crowd, and are transferring points to build up the latter lines. The top stations ranking from 11 to 20 are the intersections between the early and latter established subway lines, where people flow is also very large. The stations ranking between 21 and 25, are the importing points from Beijing’s suburbs into the center of the city, and play very important roles in the subway system.In this paper, we defined four indicators to evaluate the node importance in actual complex networks and analyzed their characteristics from local attributes, global attributes of network, epidemic dynamic and network location perspective, and also improved one of the indicators. In order to evaluate the node importance comprehensively, a multi-attribute ranking method based on Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Object (TOPSIS) is put forward in this paper. Moreover, this paper introduces Relative Entropy combined with TOPSIS to distinguish the local difference of nodes, namely TOPSIS-RE. Our proposed method is verified to be feasible and outperforms other methods by comparative experiments in two actual complex networks. According to the proposed method, we can provide decision support for emergency management in actual engineering, such as analyzing the important stations to design emergency evacuation for Subway Systems, and giving valuable decision to build Hydraulic Networks to flood control and drought relief, which is very important to national stability and development.
