@&#ABSTRACT@&#
According to the regularity of continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), an immune multi-objective optimization algorithm with differential evolution inspired recombination (IMADE) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed IMADE, the novel recombination provides two types of candidate searching directions by taking three recombination parents which distribute along the current Pareto set (PS) within a local area. One of the searching direction provides guidance for finding new points along the current PS, and the other redirects the search away from the current PS and moves towards the target PS. Under the background of the SBX (Simulated binary crossover) recombination which performs local search combined with random search near the recombination parents, the new recombination operator utilizes the regularity of continuous MOPs and the distributions of current population, which helps IMADE maintain a more uniformly distributed PF and converge much faster. Experimental results have demonstrated that IMADE outperforms or performs similarly to NSGAII, NNIA, PESAII and OWMOSaDE in terms of solution quality on most of the ten testing MOPs. IMADE converges faster than NSGAII and OWMOSaDE. The efficiency of the proposed DE recombination and the contributions of DE and SBX recombination to IMADE have also been experimentally investigated in this work.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many optimization problems in real-life applications have more than one objective that is in conflict with the others. Such problems are termed as multi-objective problems (MOPs). This paper considers the following continuous MOPs:(1)minF(x)=(f1(x),f2(x),…,fm(x))Tsubject to:x∈Ωwhere Ω⊂Rnis the feasible region of the decision space and x=(x1, x2, …, xn)∈Ω is the decision variable vector. The target function F(x): X→Rmconsists of m real-valued continuous objective functions f1(x), f2(x), …, fm(x) and Rmis the objective space.Since no single solution can optimize all the objectives at the same time, the solution of a MOPs is a set of decision variable vectors rather than a unique solution. Let xA, xB∈Ω be two decision vectors, xAis said to dominate xB, denoted by xA≺xB, if fi(xA)≤fi(xB) for all i∈{1, …, m}, and there exists an j∈{1, …, m } that satisfies fj(xA)<fj(xB). A decision vector x*∈Ω is called the Pareto optimal solution or non-dominated solution if there is no other x∈Ω that satisfies x≺x*. The set of all the Pareto optimal solutions is called the Pareto set (PS) and the set of all the Pareto optimal objective vectors is the Pareto front (PF). Knowing that it is impossible to find the whole PS of continuous MOPs, we aim at finding a finite set of Pareto optimal vectors which are uniformly scattered along the true PF and are therefore highly representative of the entire PF.With the advantage of producing a set of Pareto optimal solutions in a single run, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been found to be very successful in solving MOPs. Since the pioneer work of Schaffer [1], a number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) had been developed. In the early 1990s, the first generation of MOEAs which were characterized by the use of selection mechanisms based on Pareto ranking and fitness sharing to maintain diversity were proposed. The list of representative algorithms includes the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) [2], the niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) [3] and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) [4]. Since the end of the 1990s, the second generation of MOEAs using the elitism strategy had been presented. The major contributions includes the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) [5] and its improved version SPEA2 [6], the Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES) [7], the Pareto envelope based selection algorithm (PESA) [8] and its revised version PESAII [9], and the improved version of NSGA (NSGAII) [10]. The above mentioned MOEAs share more or less the same framework as that of NSGA-II, while in recent years some new frameworks have been developed. The MOEA/D [11] which combines the decomposition method in mathematics and the optimization paradigm in evolutionary computation is the most representative algorithm. It outperforms other MOEAs based on Pareto selection in solving MOPs with complicated PS shapes [12]. The indicator based framework [13] uses the performance indicators of a MOEA to guide the search for elite solutions of a MOP. The preference [14] and interactive [15] based framework uses the preference information from the decision maker to guide the search towards the PF region of interest. Many other nature inspired meta-heuristic search techniques have also been applied to solving MOPs, such as the simulated annealing algorithms [16], the particle swarm based algorithms [17], the ant colony based algorithms [18], the immune based algorithms [19–21] and the estimation of distribution algorithm [22,23]. Moreover, MOEAs for complicated MOPs have also been extensively investigated which include MOEA for dynamic MOPs [24], constraint MOPs [25] and many objective optimization problems [26].Artificial immune system (AIS) is a new type of computational system which is inspired by the theoretical immunology and observed immune functions, principles and models. In recent years, AIS has received a significant amount of interest from researchers and industrial sponsors. It has been used to solve various types of problems such as fault diagnosis, computer security, pattern recognition, scheduling and optimization [27]. In the field of immune optimization computing, more and more researches indicate that, comparing with EAs, artificial immune algorithms can maintain better population diversity and thus they do not easily fall in local optima. Recently, Coello proposed the multi-objective immune system algorithm (MISA) [28] based on the immune clonal selection principle. Jiao, Gong and Yang et al. proposed the multi-objective immune algorithms NNIA [19] and AHM [20]. AIS has drawn the attention of many researchers on MOPs solving, resulting in a lot of multi-objective artificial immune algorithms with improved performance. In this work, we present an immune inspired multi-objective optimization approach with a novel recombination operator which is enlightened by differential evolution.Differential evolution (DE) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient algorithm for global optimization over continuous spaces [29]. Over the past decade, DE has been successfully combined with other optimization techniques to form hybrid DE algorithms. One type of hybrid DE algorithms introduce local search techniques into DE to improve its exploitation abilities [30–32]. The other type of hybrid DE algorithms combine DE with other global optimization algorithms like PSO [33], ant colony systems [34], and artificial immune systems [35]. At present, many variants of DE have been proposed to solve MOPs. A state-of-the-art literature survey indicates that DE has already proved itself as a promising candidate in the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) [36]. In many widely used MOPs, the PS in the decision space can be defined by piecewise linear functions. Due to the capability of DE based evolutionary operator which can exploit linear interdependencies between decision variables in a problem, it is suitable for solving MOPs. In this work, we design a novel DE inspired recombination operator to enhance the performance of an immune multi-objective optimization algorithm. In the new recombination operator, two types of searching strategies which find target vectors along current PS and towards wider regions respectively are designed according to the features of the continuous MOPs.This paper provides an immune multi-objective optimization algorithm with differential evolution inspired recombination (IMADE). In IMADE, the fitness value of each non-dominated individual is assigned according to its crowding-distance [10]. Thus, IMADE pays more attention to the less-crowded regions of current PF in a single iteration. In IMADE, a novel DE inspired recombination is designed according to the features of the MOPs. In the newly designed recombination operator, two types of searching directions which explore diversity along current PS and move towards the true PS are determined according to the other two neighboring individuals in the current PS.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of immune inspired optimization framework, as well as some basic concepts used in this paper. Section 3 describes the main loop of IMADE, with a particularly detailed description and analysis of the proposed DE recombination operator. In Section 4, the computational complexity of IMADE will be analyzed. Section 5 investigates the experimental study used to assess our proposed approach and the efficiency of the specially designed DE recombination. In Section 6, concluding remarks are presented.Optimization is one of the most important application fields of artificial immune systems. In the view of immune optimization computing, the process of the human immune system recognizing and responding to the antigens can be considered as a space searching procedure with the aim of finding a best-matching antibody in the antibody space. If we consider the optimization problem and its constraints as the antigen, and the candidate solution of the target problem as the antibody, the process of the immune optimization algorithm finding high quality solutions in the solution space can be mapped to the similar process of human immune recognition and immune response.The immune clonal selection principle [37] proposed by Burnet in 1958 is a widely accepted model explaining how the immune system searches for antibodies which match the antigen best and then responds to infection. Based on this principle, Castro pioneered the clonal selection algorithm (CSA) [38] for the optimization problem. This work established the framework of the searching paradigm based on immune clonal selection and affinity maturation by hyper-mutation.Fig. 1presents the searching paradigm of clonal selection based immune optimization algorithm. It illustrates how an instance antibody in the antibody population changes from one individual to a better one in one iteration. In this iteration flow, there are three important operations, the clone operation, the immune genetic operation and the selection operation. The clone operation will decide how many offspring the operated antibody proliferates. The clone size (10 for example in Fig. 1) is usually proportional to the antibody's affinity. The immune genetic operation which consists of mutation and recombination will determine how the antibody population evolves and maturates. Usually, this operation is specially designed according to the target problem and current antibody population. The selection operation will decide which offspring antibody will survive. Usually the antibody with high affinity is more likely to be retained.For solving MOPs, MISA [28] may be the first attempt to solve general MOPs using the immune clonal selection paradigm. In MISA, the decision variables of MOPs are binary coded which has been proved to be less efficient than the real-coding strategy when dealing with MOPs with complex and high dimensional decision space. In 2005, Cutello et al. [39] modified the (1+1)-PAES using the two immune inspired operators, cloning and hyper-mutation, and applied the improved PAES to solve the protein structure prediction problem. More recently, Gong et al. proposed NNIA [19] using the clonal selection paradigm and the more efficient real-coding strategy. However, the immune genetic operation of NNIA employs the simulated binary crossover (SBX) [40] recombination which inclines to random search rather than to consider the features of MOPs such as its decision space and the shape of its true PS. To remedy this, we propose a DE based recombination operator which considers the features of MOPs to enhance the searching ability of the immune clonal selection based optimization algorithm.Affinity assignment is a guide of the evolutionary trend of the antibody population. Regarding to MOPs, we want to find uniformly scattered Pareto optimal vectors, thus the algorithm should spend more computing time on individuals in the sparse part of current PF. In this work, the crowding-distance [10] of the antibody is employed to measure whether it is in the sparse part or not.For any antibody A in the antibody population P, A={a1, a2, …, an} is the coding of the decision variable x={x1, x2, …, xn}. In this work, we adopt real-valued presentation, that is, ai=xi, i=1, 2, …, n. So, A={a1, a2, …, an} must be in the feasible region. The affinity of antibody A is defined as its crowding-distance in the population.(2)Affinity(A|P)=CD(A,P)and the crowding-distance of A∈P can be defined as:(3)CD(A,P)≜∑i=1mζi(A,P)fimax−fiminwherefimaxandfiminare the maximum and minimum value of the ith objective. Denote the boundary antibody set of the ith objective by Bdi, the antibodies that belong to or not belong to Bdiare differently treated.(4)Bdi={A|A∈P,∀A′∈P:fi(A)=min{fi(A′)}orfi(A)=max{fi(A′)}}(5)DAi=min{fi(A′)−fi(A″)|∀A,A′,A″∈P,A∉Bdi:fi(A″)<fi(A)<fi(A′)}(6)ζi(A,P)=2×max{DA′i},if∀A,A′∈P,A∈Bdi,A′∉BdiDAi,elseFig. 2illustrates the crowding-distance calculation of non-boundary antibody A in the current non-dominated population. In Fig. 2, A″ and A′ are respectively the lower and upper nearest neighbor of A on the object f1, which are defined by Eq. (5). The crowding-distance of an antibody is defined as an estimate of the perimeter of the cuboid formed by using the nearest neighbors as the vertices. Before calculating the crowding distance, each objective function is normalized. As for the boundary antibodies which are solutions with smallest and largest function values, their crowding-distances are set as relatively large values as defined in Eq. (6).Based on the crowding-distance CD(A, P), we can estimate the density of antibodies surrounding A in the population P. Antibody with larger crowding-distance also has higher affinity and will be more likely to survive and proliferate. Here, the boundary antibodies are assigned with extremely high affinities. Such design makes the boundary antibodies occupy more computing time which may lead to a wider Pareto front.Since the objectives in MOP usually conflict with each other, no single solution can optimize all the objectives at the same time. In MOPs, Pareto selection is a commonly used scheme to evaluate the quality of decision vectors.For MOPs in Eq. (1), let A be an antibody in population P, A is called non-dominated antibody if and only if there is no antibody A′∈P, that satisfies A′≺A. Since the real encoding is used, the coding of antibody A will be the same as the decision vector that decoded from it. So, the decoding step can be omitted, and we also use “A” as a decision vector for simplicity.To conclude, for the minimization MOPs in Eq. (1), this definition says that antibody A in the population P is a non-dominated antibody if there exists no other antibody in P, which would lower some criterion without causing a simultaneous increase in at least one other criterion.
