@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A linguistic decision aiding technique for multi-criteria decision is presented. We define a relation between alternatives as multi-criteria semantic dominance (MCSD). It adopts the similar ideal of the stochastic dominance by utilizing the partial information of the decision maker’s preference, which is only ordinal or partially cardinal. The MCSD rules based on three typical types of semanteme functions are introduced and proven. By using these rules, all the alternatives under consideration are divided into two mutually exclusive sets called efficient set and inefficient set. The decision maker who has such a semanteme function will never choose the alternative from the corresponding inefficient set as the optimal one. In such a way, when we analyze the linguistic decision information, the inherent fuzziness of preference can be handled and several controversial operations of the linguistic terms can be avoided. An example is also provided to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques aid decision makers (DMs) choosing the feasible alternative(s) in real world decision problems involving several conflict criteria. In classical MCDM methods, the assessments of alternatives are known precisely (Dyer, Fishburn, Steuer, Wallenius, & Zionts, 1992; Stewart, 1992). However, considering the inherent vagueness in a real decision problem, it is hard to evaluate the performance of an alternative with crisp numerical values. A more realistic approach may be to use linguistic assessments instead of numerical values, that is, the assessments of the alternative with respect to criteria are assessed with linguistic variables (Zadeh, 1975), whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. In the last years, it has attracted much research attention (Chen, Wang, & Wu, 2011; Doukas, 2012; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Martinez, 2000; Lin & Yeh, 2010; Parreiras, Ekel, Martini, & Palhares, 2010; Wang & Chen, 2008; Wang, 2009, 2010; Xu, 2007a; Yang, Wang, & Wang, 2012; Yang & Wang, 2012).The linguistic variables are values taken from a set of linguistic terms. The semanteme of these terms are given prior in a linguistic scale. This type of scale is more expressive for DMs than a simple ordered scale because of the presence of absolute meaningful landmarks (Dubois, 2011), that is, the linguistic information includes not only the order of preference but also some cardinal information. So, when a problem is solved by using linguistic scale, excepting the usage as a simple ordered scale, there are two main schemes in literature, namely computing with words (CW).The first scheme is to work via operations performed on the associated fuzzy sets’ membership functions (Chen, 2000; Li, Chen, & Huang, 2010; Rezaei & Ortt, 2013), namely linguistic terms are represented as fuzzy intervals and all these terms form a fuzzy partition of the unit interval, corresponding to what Zadeh calls a granulation of the unit interval (Zadeh, 1997). Varieties of aggregation operators of different fuzzy sets are studied in this type of methods (Boran, Genc, Kurt, & Akay, 2009; Chen, Chang, & Rachel Lu, 2013; Zhou, Chiclana, John, & Garibaldi, 2011).However, when we transform the linguistic terms into fuzzy intervals, it is not clear whether they are qualitative, since each linguistic term is viewed as a fuzzy interval on some numerical scale. And the integrate results of these fuzzy intervals will not produce the fuzzy interval corresponding the original linguistic terms and therefore, what these results mean are questionable. Moreover, for aggregating these fuzzy intervals, building an aggregation function highly depends on the defuzzification method.The second scheme of aggregating linguistic information involves the direct use of linguistic labels. There are some attempts in this direction, like the 2-tuple linguistic representation (Herrera & Martinez, 2000). Several methods and aggregation operators have been also developed to meet this purpose (Chuu, 2011; Bordogna, Fedrizzi, & Pasi, 2002; Delgado, Verdegay, & Vila, 1993; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1998; Herrera & Martinez, 2000; Wang, Wang, & Yang, 2013; Xu, 2008).But this type of linguistic approaches (Doukas, Karakosta, & Psarras, 2010; Wang & Li, 2010) no longer accounts for the imprecision of linguistic evaluations and many linguistic operations look more like numerical. Moreover, the idea of mapping a qualitative scale into a sequence of adjacent integers is debatable. Further details concerning the comparison between both of these schemes can be found in (Dubois, 2011).In spite of the arguments above-mentioned, there is another considerable difficulty in linguistic decision problems. In many MCDM methods, it is necessary that the preferences of alternatives on criteria are complete, since these methods try to obtain the complete or partial order of the alternatives. However, this objective is often too difficult to achieve in a linguistic environment because the preference information expressed by linguistic variables is incomplete. This feature of a linguistic decision problem has not been treated well (Abbasbandy & Asady, 2006; Chen, 2000; Chen & Li, 2010; Herrera & Martinez, 2000; Wang & Li, 2010; Xu, 2007b), and the plausible results from many methods are often questionable.Due to the difficulties cited above, we introduce a linguistic decision aiding tool called multi-criteria semantic dominance (MCSD), which is capable of dealing with these dilemmas. The motivation of this technique is inspired by the ideal of stochastic dominance (Levy, 1992), a group of rules handling the risky decision making problems with uncertain or partial known preferences (Haven, 2005; Levy & Wiener, 1998; Zhang, Fan, & Liu, 2010).Similar to the basic ideal of stochastic dominance (Levy, 2006), by utilizing partial information of preference on a linguistic ordered scale in an MCDM problem, we can classify all the alternatives into two sets namely efficient set (ES) and inefficient set (IS). It in fact outputs a partial ordering of the alternatives. In such a case, for any alternative in the IS, there must exist at least one alternatives in the ES which are preferred for the DMs. More importantly, the addition of the information on preference will never reverse the existed domination relation; therefore, any DM will never select the alternative in the IS. Moreover, we cannot indicate the dominances between the alternatives in the ES since the preference information is not complete. Thus, this method represents a helpful process in dealing with the uncertainty in linguistic decision problems, because it does not need the complete preference information and can subsume the incompatibility of the information under uncertain environments, and many questionable operations and plausible results therefore can be avoided.We introduce three typical types of MCSD rules in this paper. All of them use the ordering feature of linguistic scales and two of them use the possible non-uniform distribution of semanteme values of the linguistic terms.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some relative definitions. Section 3 proposes the MCSD rules and some properties of the MCSD relation. In Section 4, a numerical example in personnel choice of an IT company is established to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. In Section 5, we make a further discussion. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.A multi-criteria decision making problem is expressed in matrix format as:A=a11a12⋯a1na21a22⋯a2n⋮⋮⋱⋮am1am2⋯amnW=w1w2⋯wnwhere aijin the matrix A is the assessment of the alternative aiwith respect to the criterion cj. Besides, the set of m possible alternatives is A={a1,…,am}, the set of n criteria is C={c1,…,cn}, andW=w1w2⋯wnis the relative importance weight vector of criteria, in which wjis the weight of criterion cj.Suppose the preference of a DM on an alternative can be represented by a conjoint measurement (Bouyssou & Pirlot, 2005; Fishburn, 1970), i.e., there exists a value function, V, of alternatives such that for any two alternatives ai, as∈A,ai≻as(ai∼as)⇔V(ai)>V(as)(V(ai)=V(as))This value functionV:Ω1×Ω2×⋯×Ωn→[0,1],where Ωj(j=1,2,…,n) is the group of all the possible evaluations of the alternative on criterion cj. If Ω1=Ω2=⋯=Ωn=Ω, thenV:Ωn→[0,1].Under some conditions (Wakker, 1989), this conjoint value function can be presented as an additive formulation (Bouyssou & Pirlot, 2005; Dyer et al., 1992). One conventional type of these additive value functions is(1)V(ai)=∑j=1nwjuj(aij)where wjis the relative importance weight of the criterion cj, aijis the evaluation of the alternative aion the criterion cj, and uj(aij) reflect the DM’s preference on the alternative aiwith respect to the criterion cjbased on the information aij. Conventionally, we use a real number in interval [0,1] to measure these preferences, the greater the number the more preference, that isuj:Ωj→[0,1]Note that the formation of aij∈Ωjis not necessarily a real number. Many kinds of information, e.g. random variables, intervals, fuzzy sets, and linguistic information, can be used to express these evaluations.If two alternatives (aiand as) on different equally weighted criteria (cjand cr) received the same evaluations, when Ωj=Ωr, it is reasonable that these two evaluations should affect each alternative value functions equally, i.e.,ifΩj=Ωr,aij=asr,wj=wr,thenwjuj(aij)=wrur(asr)thus,uj(aij)=ur(asr)Therefore, ujand urhave the same values with the same inputs, then ujand urare equivalent. Similarly, all uj(j=1,2,…,n) should have this equivalence with Ω1=Ω2=⋯=Ωn=Ω, such that, Eq. (1) can be also express as(2)V(ai)=∑j=1nwju(aij)which in fact implies that function u is independent of the criteria and their relative weights. The potential reason is that in a decision, when comparing alternatives across multi-criteria, the preferences structure of the decision maker upon the criteria is captured by weights. That is to say, the evaluations are therefore neither necessary nor appropriate to contain this information repeatedly.In our MCSD model, we adopt the terms in a linguistic ordered scale to express the decision information of aij.Definition 1Linguistic ordered scaleLet H={h1,…,hg} be a linguistic ordered scale (Herrera et al., 2000), which is a set of g linguistic ordered terms. The fundamental property of the scale terms is the order ha<hbiff a<b, a, b∈{1,…,g}. And g usually is odd.Let Ω=H, there isu:H→[0,1]Thus, aij=hk∈H, and u(hk) reflect the preference of the DM when he/she uses linguistic term hk. Therefore, this value in fact sketches the semanteme of the linguistic term, so we call it as the semanteme value of the linguistic variable hkand u(·) the semanteme function.Such that(3)V(ai)=∑j=1nwju(aij)=∑j∈Ji1wju(h1)+⋯+∑j∈Jigwju(hg)=∑k=1gωiku(hk)where Jik={j∣aij=hk, j=1,…,n}, andωik=∑j∈Jikwjis the integrated weight of the criteria on which aij=hk.Moreover, we define the cumulative weight function F on linguistic ordered scale H.The cumulative weight function on the linguistic ordered scale H is denoted by F. Its value on hkabout aiis(4)Fik=∑l=1kωil=∑j∈Ji1∪⋯∪JikwjIt means the sum of the weight of the criteria on which the evaluation of aiare lower or equal to hk, and therefore, we have Fig=1. Besides, we define Fi0=0, thusωik=Fik-Fi(k-1)So(5)V(ai)=∑k=1gωiku(hk)=∑k=1g(Fik-Fi(k-1))u(hk)If there is full information on preferences about the linguistic terms, i.e., we know exactly what the specific semanteme function with linguistic terms is, we can simply calculate V(ai) for all the alternatives and choose the one with the highest V(ai). In such a case, we arrive at a complete ordering of the alternatives under consideration.However, since the inherent fuzziness in using linguistic information, we have only partial knowledge on preferences of these linguistic information and, therefore, we arrive only at a partial ordering of the available alternatives.When the linguistic ordered scale is adopted, from its definition, the only undoubted preference information on terms in the scale is their ordering, hk<hk+1, which in fact implies that∀hk∈H,u(hk+1)⩾u(hk)Obviously, any nondecreasing monotonic functions can meet this requirement. We denote the collection of all this type of semanteme functions by UH, i.e., u∈UHif u(hk+1)⩾u(hk), namely the set of ordered semanteme functions.Apart from the ordering, if the DM prefers to express the preference with the middle linguistic terms in a scale, the more change in preference is required to vary the assessment from middle linguistic terms than from the edge ones. That is, difference of preference between a pair of adjacent middle terms is greater than which between adjacent edge ones. We call the collection of all this type of semanteme functions as the set of centripetal ordered semanteme functions, and denote the set by UPH.LetDk=u(hk+1)-u(hk)Then u∈UPHifDk⩾0andDk⩾Dk+1,ifk⩾(g+1)/2Dk⩾Dk-1,else.On the contrary, when the DM tends to use extreme terms to express the preference, we can define the set of centrifugal ordered semanteme functions UFH, i.e., u∈UFHifDk⩾0andDk⩽Dk+1,ifk⩾(g+1)/2Dk⩽Dk-1,elseWhen using words express the preference, someone prefers to use moderate words such as “Fair”, “Not bad” to express his or her preference and there is also someone who likes to use “Perfect”, “Terrible”. The former one is believed have centripetal ordered semanteme functionand the latter centrifugal.Table 1shows an example: Four professors (P1–P4) were asked to give a short comment to a student about his mathematic skill based on the scores from a mathematic examination (10-point system). They were asked to use the linguistic scaleH={h1=VeryPoor,h2=Poor,h3=Fair,h4=Good,h5=VeryGood}In the example, we believe P1, P2 have centripetal ordered semanteme function and P3, P4 have centrifugal ordered semanteme function, namely u1, u2∈UPH, u3, u4∈UFH. Moreover, notice that we cannot determine what on earth the function is if the only knowledge is that someone’s semanteme function belongs to a certain set. That is, the preference on linguistic terms is incomplete.MCSD rules attempts to employ the partial information about the decision maker’s preferences on linguistic terms and, therefore, produce partial ordering. In using this technique, the set of all alternatives under consideration is called as the Feasible Set (FS). Then, we divide the whole FS into two sets: the Efficient Set (ES) and the Inefficient Set (IS). These two sets are mutually exclusive and comprehensive, i.e.,FS=ES∪ISWe demonstrate below the concept of the ES and the IS.Assume that there exists the additive value function as Eq. (2) for the alternatives in an MCDM problem and the evaluations of alternatives on criteria are expressed with terms in a linguistic ordered scale. We say that alternative aimulti-criteria semantic dominates alternative asabout Uθ, θ∈{H, PH, FH} if for all semanteme functions u∈Uθ, such that V(ai)⩾V(as), and for at least one function u0∈Uθthere is strict inequality.An alternative belongs to the efficient set about Uθif there is no other alternative that dominates it about Uθ. The efficient set includes all undominated alternatives. If aiand asare efficient, neither ainor asdominates the other. Namely, there is a semanteme function uτ∈Uθ, θ∈{H, PH, FH} such thatV(ai)=∑k=1gωikuτ(hk)>V(as)=∑k=1gωskuτ(hk)And there is another function uσ∈Uθsuch thatV(ai)=∑k=1gωikuσ(hk)<V(as)=∑k=1gωskuσ(hk)Thus, neither ainor asis the “better” according to any possible semanteme function in the Uθ.The inefficient set, IS, includes all inefficient alternatives. The definition of an inefficient alternative is that there is at least one alternative in the ES that dominates it.There is no need for an inefficient alternative to be dominated by all efficient alternatives. One dominance is enough to relegate an alternative to the IS.Suppose that the DM wants to rank two alternatives aiand as, whose cumulative weights are Fiand Fs, respectively. The MCSD rules tell us whether one alternative dominates another where the available information is that u∈Uθ, θ∈{H, PH, FH}.Theorem 1Let Fiand Fsbe the cumulative weight of two alternatives. Then aidominates asby MCSD (We denote it by ai≻Has) for all u∈UHiff ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fsk, and ∃hk∈H for which a strong inequality holds. It can be summarized as:∀hk∈H,Fik⩽Fsk,∃hk∈H,Fik<Fsk⇔∀u∈UH,V(ai)⩾V(as),∃u∈UH,V(ai)>V(as)We have to prove the sufficiency as well as the necessity of the argument.(I) Sufficiency. It is given that ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fskand we have to prove that ∀u∈UH, V(ai)⩾V(as). By the definition of value function and Eq. (3) we have:Δ≡V(ai)-V(as)=∑k=1gωiku(hk)-∑k=1gωsku(hk)=∑k=1g(ωik-ωsk)u(hk)because∑k=1gωiku(hk)=∑k=1g(Fik-Fi(k-1))u(hk)=Figu(hg)+Fi(g-1)u(hg-1)+Fi(g-2)u(hg-2)+⋯+Fi1u(h1)-Fi(g-1)u(hg)-Fi(g-2)u(hg-1)-⋯-Fi1u(h2)-Fi0u(h1)=(Figu(hg)-Fi0u(h1))-∑k=1g-1Fik(u(hk+1)-u(hk))Likewise,∑k=1gωsku(hk)=(Fsgu(hg)-Fs0u(h1))-∑k=1g-1Fsk(u(hk+1)-u(hk))ThereforeΔ=V(ai)-V(as)=∑k=1gωiku(hk)-∑k=1gωsku(hk)=(Figu(hg)-Fsgu(hg))-(Fi0u(h1)-Fs0u(h1))-∑k=1g-1Fik(u(hk+1)-u(hk))+∑k=1g-1Fsk(u(hk+1)-u(hk))=(Fig-Fsg)u(hg)-(Fi0-Fs0)u(h1)+∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))The first and the second terms on the right-hand side is equal to zero sinceFig=Fsg=1andFi0=Fs0=0Thus(6)Δ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))By the theorem assumption, we have ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fsk. As u∈UH, i.e., u(hk+1)⩾u(hk), so we conclude that Δ⩾0 or:∀u∈UH,V(ai)⩾V(as)To assure a strict dominance of aiover as(namely, to avoid the case that Δ=0 for all u∈UH), we need to find at least one u0∈UHsuch that V(ai)>V(as) when there is at least one hkfor which Fik<Fsk. Without loss of generality, we suppose that Fit<Fstwhen k=t, t∈{1,2,…,g−1} (note that Fig=Fsg=1). To see that such u0 exists, take the semanteme functionu0(hk)=t,k⩽tt+1,k⩾t+1Obviously, u0∈UH, and in this case,Δ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u0(hk+1)-u0(hk))=(Fst-Fit)(u0(ht+1)-u0(ht))=(Fst-Fit)>0That is to say, V(ai)>V(as), we find out such a semanteme function (but it is not the only one).Thus, we have proved that if ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fsk, ∃hk∈H, Fik<Fsk, then ∀u∈UH, V(ai)⩾V(as),∃u∈UH, V(ai)>V(as), hence ai≻Has.(II) Necessity. We have to prove that∀u∈UH,V(ai)⩾V(as)⇒∀hk∈H,Fik⩽FskWe prove this claim by a contradiction. Assume that indeed Fik⩽Fskfor all hkbut for one htthis condition is violate, namely, Fit>Fst. We will show that there is a semanteme function uc∈UHsuch thatV(ai)<V(as)In contradiction to the assumption that ∀u∈UH, V(ai)⩾V(as), we will conclude that such a violation is impossible, namely Fit>Fstis impossible and Fik⩽Fskmust hold for all hk.To prove the necessity, suppose that a violation Fit>Fstdoes exist for ht. Choosing the following semanteme functionuc(hk)=t,k⩽tt+1,k⩾t+1thereforeΔ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(uc(hk+1)-uc(hk))=(Fst-Fit)(uc(ht+1)-uc(ht))=(Fst-Fit)<0i.e., V(ai)<V(as)Thus, if there is such a violation in the MCSD condition (namely Fit>Fst), we have found uc∈UHsuch that V(ai)<V(as), or asis preferred to aiby this specific semanteme function. Therefore, if it is given that ∀u∈UH, V(ai)⩾V(as), such a violation is impossible, which proves by the indirect method that∀u∈UH,V(ai)⩾V(as)⇒∀hk∈H,Fik⩽FskMoreover, if there are some semanteme functions u0 such that V(ai)>V(as), i.e.,Δ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u0(hk+1)-u0(hk))>0As (Fsk−Fik) and (u0(hk+1)−u0(hk)) are all nonnegative, therefore, the existence of several (at least one) hkfor which Fik<Fskis necessary to guarantee the inequation.Thus, we have proved that if ai≻Has, i.e., ∀u∈UH, V(ai)⩾V(as),∃u∈UH, V(ai)>V(as), then ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fsk, ∃hk∈H, Fik<Fsk□Interception: Actually, we use the weakest assumption on preference in this situation because we assume only that the decision likes more the higher ranked alternative than the lower one.The condition ∀hk∈H, Fik⩽Fskcan be rewritten as:∀hk∈H,1-Fik⩾1-FskbecauseFik=∑s=1kωis, thus,1-Fik=1-∑s=1kωisdenote the integrated weight of criteria on which obtain higher evaluations than hk. Therefore, if ai≻Has, then the integrated weight of obtaining a higher evaluation than hkis equal or larger for aithan for as. Such a weight, which would be certainly desired by decision maker, whatever the detail of the semanteme function on linguistic terms is, explains the dominance of aiover as.Theorem 2Let Fiand Fsbe the cumulative weight of two alternatives. Then aidominates asby MCSD (We denote it by ai≻PHas) for all u∈UPHiff∀hk∈H,∑l=(g+1)/2kFil⩽∑l=(g+1)/2kFsl,k⩾(g+1)/2, and∑l=k(g-1)/2Fil⩽∑l=k(g-1)/2Fsl,k⩽(g-1)/2, (and there is at least one strict inequality).

From Eq.

(7) are nonnegative, namely Δ⩾0 or:∀u∈UPH,V(ai)⩾V(as)To assure a strict dominance of aiover as, we need to find at least one u0∈UPHsuch that V(ai)>V(as) when there is at least one hkfor which∑l=(g+1)/2kFil<∑l=(g+1)/2kFslwhen k=t, t∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1} or∑l=k(g-1)/2Fil>∑l=k(g-1)/2Fslwhen k=t, t∈{1,…,(g−1)/2}. To see that such u0 exists, if t∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1}, take the functionu0(hk)=t+1,k>tk,k⩽tObviously, u0∈UPH, and in this case, Dt+1=0 and Dt=1,Δ=-(Dt+1-Dt)∑l=(g+1)/2t(Fsl-Fil)+R=∑l=(g+1)/2t(Fsl-Fil)+Rwhere R is the remained nonnegative terms of Eq. (7). Therefore, Δ>0.If t∈{1,…,(g−1)/2}, take the functionu0(hk)=k,k⩾t-1t-1,k<t-1and in this case, u0∈UPH, Dt−1=0, Dt=1,Δ=(Dt-Dt-1)∑l=t(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)+R=∑l=t(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)+R>0That is to say, when the strict inequality condition holds, we can find out such a function to achieve V(ai)>V(as).The sufficiency has been proved.(II) Necessity. We have to prove that∀u∈UPH,V(ai)⩾V(as)⇒∀hk∈H,∑l=(g+1)/2kFil⩽∑l=(g+1)/2kFsl,k⩾(g+1)/2∑l=k(g-1)/2Fil⩽∑l=k(g-1)/2Fsl,k⩽(g-1)/2Assume that for all hkbut for one htthis condition is violate. Then, if t∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1}, choosing the following functionuc(hk)=1,k>t0,k⩽tthereforeΔ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))=∑l=(g+1)/2t(Fsl-Fil)<0If t∈{1,…,(g−1)/2}, choosing the following functionuc(hk)=1,k⩾t-10,k<t-1thereforeΔ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))=∑l=t(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)<0Thus, if there is such a violation in the MCSD condition, we have found uc∈UPHsuch that V(ai)<V(as). Therefore, given that ∀u∈UPH, V(ai)⩾V(as), such a violation is impossible, which proves the original proposition.Moreover, if there are some functions u0 such that V(ai)>V(as), i.e.,Δ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))=D1∑l=0(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)+∑k=1(g-3)/2(Dk+1-Dk)∑l=k+1(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)+Dg-1∑l=(g+1)/2g-1(Fsl-Fil)-∑k=(g+1)/2g-2(Dk+1-Dk)∑l=(g+1)/2k(Fsl-Fil)>0To ensure the sum of these nonnegative terms greater than zero, the existence of several (at least one) hkfor which∑l=(g+1)/2kFil<∑l=(g+1)/2kFslwhen k∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1} or∑l=k(g-1)/2Fil>∑l=k(g-1)/2Fslwhen k∈{1,…,(g−1)/2} is necessary.Thus, we have proved the necessity.□Theorem 3Let Fiand Fsbe the cumulative weights of two alternatives. Then aidominates asby MCSD (We denote it by ai≻FHas) for all u∈UFHiff∀hk∈H,∑l=kg-1Fil⩽∑l=kg-1Fsl,k⩾(g+1)/2and∑l=1kFil⩽∑l=1kFsl,k⩽(g-1)/2(and there is at least one strict inequality). It can be summarized as:∀hk∈H,∑l=kg-1Fil⩽∑l=kg-1Fsl,k⩾(g+1)/2∑l=1kFil⩽∑l=1kFsl,k⩽(g-1)/2,∃hk∈H,strict inequality holds⇔∀u∈UFH,V(ai)⩾V(as),∃u∈UFH,V(ai)>V(as)The proof of the theorem is similar to the proof ofTheorem 2, we can transform the difference between the alternatives asΔ=∑k=1g-1(Fsk-Fik)(u(hk+1)-u(hk))=D(g-1)/2∑l=0(g-1)/2(Fsl-Fil)-∑k=1(g-3)/2(Dk+1-Dk)∑l=0k(Fsl-Fil)+D(g+1)/2∑l=(g+1)/2g-1(Fsl-Fil)+∑k=(g+1)/2g-2(Dk+1-Dk)∑l=k+1g-1(Fsl-Fil)and the detail of proof is omitted.Property 1Considering two alternatives aiand as, three situations may arise:(1)ai≻θasand not as≻θai,as≻θaiand not ai≻θas,Not ai≻θasand not as≻θai.MCSD relation has:(irreflexivity)∀ai∈A,ai⊁θai;(asymmetry)∀a1,a2∈A,a1≻θa2⇒a2⊁θa1;(transitivity)∀a1,a2,a3∈A,a1≻θa2,a2≻θa3⇒a1≻θa3The irreflexivity and asymmetry can be easily induced by using Theorems 1–3, we just prove the Transitivity of MCSD relation.For MCSD about UH, considering any alternatives a1, a2, a3∈A, a1≻Ha2, a2≻Ha3, becausea1≻Ha2⇔∀hk∈H,F1k⩽F2k,∃hk∈H,F1k<F2ka2≻Ha3⇔∀hk∈H,F2k⩽F3k,∃hk∈H,F2k<F3kTherefore,∀hk∈H,F1k⩽F2k⩽F3k,∃hk∈H,F1k<F2k⩽F3kthus∀hk∈H,F1k⩽F3k,∃hk∈H,F1k<F3kAccording to Theorem 1, we have a1≻Ha3. Accordingly, we can proof the cases of MCSD about UPHand UFH. □∀a1, a2∈A, a1≻Ha2⇒a1≻PHa2and a1≻FHa2Because a1≻Ha2⇒∀hk∈H, F1k⩽F2k, ∃hk=ht∈H, F1k<F2kTherefore, for any pair of 0⩽x⩽y⩽g, we have∑k=xyF1k⩽∑k=xyF2kand∑k=xtF1k<∑k=xtF2k,∑k=tyF1k<∑k=tyF2kSuch that∀hk∈H,∑l=(g+1)/2kF1l⩽∑l=(g+1)/2kF2l,k⩾(g+1)/2∑l=k(g-1)/2F1l⩽∑l=k(g-1)/2F2l,k⩽(g-1)/2,∃hk=ht∈H,strict inequality holdsand∀hk∈H,∑l=kg-1F1l⩽∑l=kg-1F2l,k⩾(g+1)/2∑l=1kF1l⩽∑l=1kF2l,k⩽(g-1)/2,∃hk=ht∈H,strict inequality holdsi.e. a1≻PHa2 and a1≻FHa2.□From the property above, we can conclude that if an alternative is divided into IS by MCSD rule about UH, it must belongs to the ISPHand ISFH. Therefore, the ESPHand ESFHmust smaller (at least equivalent) than the ESH, namelyESPH⊆ESHandESFH⊆ESHGenerally, we can use the MCSD rule presented above in a MCDM problem as following:Step 1: Calculate the cumulative weights on linguistic terms with respect to each alternative.Step 2: Compare each pair of alternatives and establish an MCSD relation matrix about UH, RH=[ris]m×m. If alternative ai≻Has, then ris=1, else ris=0.Step 3: The alternatives which are not dominated by any others about UH, corresponding to the columns without any nonzero elements in the matrix, are assigned to the ESH, while the remaining alternatives belong to the ISH.Step 4: If the DM’s semanteme function belongs to UPH, calculate the sum of cumulative weight from l=(g−1)/2 to every k∈{1,…,(g−1)/2} and from l=(g+1)/2 to every k∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1}. Otherwise, if the DM’s semanteme function belongs to UFH, calculate the sum of cumulative weight from l=1 to every k∈{1,…,(g−1)/2} and from l=g−1 to every k∈{(g+1)/2,…,g−1}.Step 5: Compare each pair of alternatives and establish an MCSD relation matrix about UPHor UFH, namelyRPH=ris′m×morRFH=ris″m×m. If alternative ai≻PHas, thenris′=1, elseris′=0. If ai≻FHas, thenris″=1, elseris″=0Step 6: The alternatives which are not dominated by any others about UPH(UFH), corresponding to the columns without any nonzero elements in the matrix RPH(RFH), are divided in the ESPH (ESFH), and the rest alternatives belongs to the ISPH (ISFH).In this section, we consider the empirical application modified from (Kelemenis & Askounis, 2010) to illustrate the use of the suggested method. In the example, a branch office of a multinational IT firm, wanted to recruit a Chief Information Officer (CIO) externally, since the previous one moved to the Headquarters. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) made a choice from seven candidates. After a meeting with the CEO, he agrees that two kinds of skills as “soft” skills and technical skills are required for the position of the CIO. These requirement can be assessed with 11criteria, i.e. strategy formulation/strategic decision making (c1), change management/change adaptability (c2), communication/interpersonal skill (c3), leadership (c4), risk/crisis management (c5), computer networks (c6), software/software tools (c7), databases (c8), professional experience (c9), educational background (c10), emerging/new technologies (c11).The importance weights of the 11 criteria can be elicited by several different methods. We use the data modified slightly from (Kelemenis & Askounis, 2010), and list it in Table 2.The evaluations are characterized by the linguistic terms in a linguistic ordered scaleH={h1=VeryPoor,h2=Poor,h3=Fair,h4=Good,h5=VeryGood}and listed in Table 3.Step 1: The cumulative weight of each alternative on linguistic terms in H are calculated by Eq. (4), and listed in Table 4.Step 2: Therefore, we can obtain the MCSD relation matrixRH=0000100001011100001000000111000000000000000000000Step 3: The alternatives which are not dominated by any others, corresponding to the columns without any nonzero elements in the matrix, are divided in the ESH, and the rest alternatives belong to the ISH. Thus, in our example,ESH={a1,a2,a4},ISH={a3,a5,a6,a7}This result derived from the MCSD technique shows that the optimal alternative should situate in the ESH, namely a1, a2 or a4. And the DM who likes the high evaluation alternatives, will never choose the alternatives in the ISH, namely a3, a5, a6 and a7, because, for any of them, there must exist at least one alternative in the ESH dominating it. For example, a2 dominate a3, so decision maker will prefer to choose a2 and will not choose a3.Step 4: Furthermore, for the DM with semanteme function from UPH, the sum of cumulative weights of each alternative for judging the MCSD about UPHare calculated and listed in Table 5. Such that, we can obtain the MCSD relation matrixRPH=0011111001011100001000010111000000000000000000000and ESPH={a1, a2}, ISPH={a3, a4, a5, a6, a7}Step 5: For the DM with semanteme function from UFH, the sum of cumulative weights of each alternative for judging the MCSD about UFHare calculated by and listed in Table 6. ThusRFH=0000100001011100001110000111000000000000010000000and ESFH={a1, a2, a4}, ISFH={a3, a5, a6, a7}
