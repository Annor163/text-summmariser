@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Supervised learning has attracted much attention in recent years. As a consequence, many of the state-of-the-art algorithms are domain dependent as they require a labeled training corpus to learn the domain features. This requires the availability of labeled corpora which is a cumbersome task in itself. However, for text sentiment detection SentiWordNet (SWN) may be used. It is a vocabulary where terms are arranged in synonym groups called synsets. This research makes use of SentiWordNet and treats it as the labeled corpus for training. A sentiment dictionary, SentiMI, builds upon the mutual information calculated from these terms. A complete framework is developed by using feature selection and extracting mutual information, from SentiMI, for the selected features. Training, testing and evaluation of the proposed framework are conducted on a large dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. A notable performance improvement of 7% in accuracy, 14% in specificity, and 8% in F-measure is achieved by the proposed framework as compared to the baseline SentiWordNet classifier. Comparison with the state-of-the-art classifiers is also performed on widely used Cornell Movie Review dataset which also proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The number of internet users is growing rapidly. According to an estimate from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) there are about 3 billion internet users worldwide.11http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/statistics/2012/ITU_Key_2006-2013_ICT_data.xls (last accessed 09 December 2014).Social media has become extremely popular in recent years and provide a platform where internet users share ideas, post opinions about products and discuss politics, movies and music. This information becomes very important when it comes to market analysis, current trends, popularity exploration and making business decisions. This involves extensive natural language processing (NLP).Sentiment analysis, an imperative research area of natural language processing, involves the extraction and identification of the attitude of a speaker or writer about a certain subject matter. It is also known as opinion mining [1]. A ‘sentiment’ is the expression of one's feelings [2]. It can be an attitude, opinion or an emotion [3]. A generic sentiment analysis framework is presented in Fig. 1[4]. Data can be extracted from various online resources like email, blogs, and social media like Facebook, Twitter, etc. This data is then pre-processed in order to improve the quality of analysis. Various text mining algorithms may then be applied on the pre-processed data to extract useful information. In the last step, sentiment analysis is performed and results are presented in the form of charts and graphs which make it easier to understand the sentiments being analyzed.Sentiment analysis can be performed by both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised learning requires a training dataset with labeled instances whereas unsupervised learning focuses on classifying unlabeled data without the help of a training corpus [5]. Many of the supervised learning algorithms originally developed for data mining, have been applied to textual data to perform sentiment analysis. Some of the examples of such algorithms are k Nearest Neighbors [6], Naïve Bayes [7], Support Vector Machines [8], and Rule based Classifiers [9]. The major issue with supervised learning is the availability of labeled corpora. If the labeled corpora is not available, the application of unsupervised approaches becomes vital [9–11]. Some of the unsupervised classifiers make use of emoticon analysis [12–14], bag of words [15,16] and SentiWordNet [17].Sentiment classification is helpful in various domains for example, in topical categorization; various documents can be sorted according to their expert matter such as sports vs politics and in online discussion groups and movie review sites; labeling of a movie review as positive or negative that do not contain explicit rating indicators and normalizes the different rating schemes that individual reviewers use. Sentiment classification can also be helpful in business applications and recommender systems such as user inputs and feedback could be quickly summarized. Moreover, free-form survey responses given in natural language are also processed by sentiment analysis and classification.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A sentiment dictionary, SentiMI, is presented in this research paper which is built upon the SentiWordNet 3.0 using its synsets and sentiment scores together with the part of speech information to obtain the mutual information for positive and negative labels while ignoring the neutral ones. The Stanford POS tagger is used for part of speech tagging of the input documents. The research focuses on increasing the accuracy level of SentiWordNet based classification of the documents. It succeeds in its aim by raising the specificity results while not hurting the sensitivity. As a result, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm shows an improvement of 7%, which is majorly due an improvement of over 14% in the specificity values. The comparison of the proposed system is also performed on the Cornell movie review dataset. The results verify the superiority of the proposed SentiMI based classifier over the state-of-the-art lexical resources and other classifiers.Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.11.016.The following are the supplementary data to this article:
