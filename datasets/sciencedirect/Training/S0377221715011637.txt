@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study a two-person zero-sum game where the payoff matrix entries are random and the constraints are satisfied jointly with a given probability. We prove that for the general random-payoff zero-sum game there exists a “weak duality” between the two formulations, i.e., the optimal value of the minimizing player is an upper bound of the one of the maximizing player. Under certain assumptions, we show that there also exists a “strong duality” where their optimal values are equal. Moreover, we develop two approximation methods to solve the game problem when the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the performances of the proposed approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we consider the classic two-person zero-sum game, i.e., there are only two players where one player wins what the other player loses. Without loss of generality, we refer to the players as Player I and Player II. LetA=(ai,j)n×mbe the payoff matrix of a two-person zero-sum game. If Player I plays pure strategy i and Player II uses pure strategy j, then the payoff from Player II to Player I is aij. In the game, Player I seeks a mixed strategy to maximize his minimum payoff while Player II seeks a mixed strategy to minimize his maximum loss. In this case, the two-person zero-sum game can be mathematically formulated as two linear programming (LP) problems:For Player I,(1)d*:=maxds.t.miny(xTAy:yTem=1,y≥0)≥dxTen=1,x≥0or(2)(P1)d*:=maxds.t.ATx≥demxTen=1,x≥0where ekis ak−dimensional vector with all elements are equal to 1.For Player II,(3)t*:=mints.t.maxx(xTAy:xTen=1,x≥0)≤tyTem=1,x≥0or(4)(P2)t*:=mints.t.Ay≤tenyTem=1,y≥0With a deterministic payoff matrix A, the famous von Neumann minimax theorem von Neumann (1928) states that the two optimal values of the two LP problems are equal, i.e.,d*=t*. However, in practice, due to modeling or prediction errors, different kinds of uncertainties occur. Therefore, the payoff matrix is unknown in advance. In this case, it is natural to model the payoff matrix by continuously or discretely distributed random variables, which turns the underlying problem into a stochastic optimization problem. If the random payoff matrix is replaced by its expectation, then the variability of the payoffs is not captured. In this paper, we consider chance-constrained criteria for determining optimal strategies Charnes, Kirby, and Raike (1968). Each player optimizes his strategy and return such that the probability of attaining that return is at least some given value. In this context, the random-payoff two-person zero-sum game can be formulated as the following stochastic programming problems:For Player I,(5)(P3):P*:=maxx,dds.t.Pr{ATx≥dem}≥αxTen=1,x≥0For Player II,(6)(P4):D*:=miny,tts.t.Pr{Ay≤ten}≥βyTem=1,y≥0The constraints (5) and  (6) are called joint chance constraints. For the sake of simplicity, we call the game a chance-constrained game hereafter.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature related to chance-constrained games. In Sections 3 and 4, we investigate the relationship between the best payoff of the two players, and derive both weak and strong duality results. In Section 5, we consider the special case where the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed. Two approximation methods to solve the problem are given, namely a conservative approximation and the other is a relaxed approximation. A numerical study is given in Section 6. Finally, the last section contains the conclusions.
