@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Vague sets were first proposed by Gau and Buehrer [11] as an extension of fuzzy sets which encompass fuzzy sets, inter-valued fuzzy sets, as special cases. Vague sets consist of two parts, that is, the membership function and nonmembership function. Therefore, in accordance with practical demand these sets are more flexible than the existing fuzzy sets and provide much more information about the situation. In this paper, a new approach for the ranking of trapezoidal vague sets is introduced. Shortcomings in some existing ranking approaches have been pointed out. Validation of the proposed ranking method has been established through the reasonable properties of the fuzzy quantities. Further, the proposed ranking approach is applied to develop a new method for dealing with vague risk analysis problems to find the probability of failure, of each component of compressor system, which could be used for managerial decision making and future system maintenance strategy. Also, the proposed method provides a useful way for handling vague risk analysis problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Theory of fuzzy sets, proposed by Zadeh [39], has been successfully applied in various fields. Ranking between two fuzzy concept, as an important content in fuzzy mathematics, has gained attention for their wide applications in some areas such as decision making, transportation problems, risk analysis, aggregation and market prediction [4,10,12,15,19,26,29,30,33,35,38]. In past research the fuzzy numbers are usually used for evaluating the values of risk of each sub-component of the system. For example, Schmucker [28] proposed a method for fuzzy risk analysis based on fuzzy number arithmetic operations. Kangari and Riggs [14] proposed a method for constructing risk assessment using linguistic terms. Chen and Chen [5] proposed a method for fuzzy risk analysis based on similarity measures between generalized fuzzy numbers. Chen and Chen [6] presented a method for ranking generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers for handling fuzzy risk analysis problems. In recent years, the methods for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers have been extensively researched and used for dealing with fuzzy risk analysis problems. Ranking of fuzzy sets was first proposed by Jain [13]. Afterward, many authors developed several approaches for ranking fuzzy sets [27,29,31,37].In the real world there are situations where due to insufficiency in the information available, the evaluation of membership values is not possible up to our satisfaction. Due to some reason evaluation of non-membership values is not also always possible and consequently there remains a part indeterministic on which hesitation survives; therefore, handling of these types of situations fuzzy sets theory [39] is not appropriate. A possible solution is to use intuitionistic fuzzy set [2] and vague set [11]. The ranking of vague sets plays a main role in real life problems involving vague decision-making, vague clustering, etc. Bustince and Burillo [3] pointed out that the notion of vague set is same as that of intuitionistic fuzzy set. Lu and Ng [22] proved that vague sets are more natural than intuitionistic fuzzy sets.On the other hand, Mitchell [23] adopted a statistical viewpoint for the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy number and interpret each intuitionistic fuzzy number as an ensemble of ordinary fuzzy numbers; this enables to define a fuzzy rank and a characteristic vagueness factor for each intuitionistic fuzzy number. Nayagam and Sivaraman [24] presented a new general accuracy function, which ranks all comparable interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets correctly. Also they suggested that the problem of ranking interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is very much important in real life problems such as decision making, clustering and artificial intelligence, and their method is very much useful and has wide applications in all areas. Nehi [25] proposed a new ordering method for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in which he consider two characteristic values of membership and non-membership for an intuitionistic fuzzy number. Li [20] proposed a new ranking method on the basis of the concept of a ratio of the value index to the ambiguity index and applied to multiattribute decision making problems in which the ratings of alternatives on attributes are expressed with triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Wei [34] introduced the ranking method for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on a possibility degree formula to compare two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which is used to rank the alternatives in multi-criteria decision making problems.Due to the limitations in existing ranking method, it is necessary to develop the new ranking method for handling the risk analysis of compressor system. In this paper, a new approach for the ranking of trapezoidal vague sets is introduced. Validation of the proposed ranking method has been established through reasonable properties of the fuzzy quantities. Some shortcomings in existing ranking approaches have been pointed out. Also, the proposed ranking approach is applied to develop a new method for dealing with vague risk analysis problems to find the probability of failure, of each component of compressor system, which could be used for managerial decision making and future system maintenance strategy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the introduction to vague sets, arithmetic operations between vague sets and reviews some existing ranking methods. In Section 3, some shortcomings of the existing ranking approaches have been pointed out. Section 4 introduces a new ranking approach for comparing vague sets. Section 5 validates the proposed ranking function through the reasonable properties for the ordering of fuzzy quantities and also, results of the proposed approach are compared with some existing approaches. Section 6 proposes a new approach for vague risk analysis of a compressor system based on the proposed ranking approach. Section 7 draws conclusions.In this section some basic definitions related to vague sets, arithmetic operations between vague sets and brief review of some existing ranking methods have been presented.Definition 2.1[11] A vague setA˜={(x,μA˜(x),1−νA˜(x))|x∈X}on the universal set X is characterized by a truth membership functionμA˜,μA˜:X→[0,1]and a false membership functionνA˜,νA˜:X→[0,1]. The valuesμA˜(x)andνA˜(x)represent the degree of membership and degree of non-membership of x and always satisfy the conditionμA˜(x)+νA˜(x)≤1∀x∈X. The value1−μA˜(x)−νA˜(x)represents the degree of hesitation of x∈X.Definition 2.2[11] A vague setA˜, defined on the universal set of real numbers R, denoted asA˜=〈[(a,b,c,d);δ,ρ]〉, where a≤b≤c≤d and δ≤ρ, is said to be a trapezoidal vague set if degree of membership,μA˜(x), and complement of the degree of non-membership,(1−νA˜(x)), are given byμA˜(x)=δ(x−b)(b−a),a≤x<bδ,b≤x≤cδ(x−c)(d−c),c<x<d0,otherwiseand(1−νA˜(x))=ρ(x−b)(b−a),a≤x<bρ,b≤x≤cρ(x−c)(d−c),c<x<d0,otherwisewhere,δ=supremum{μA˜(x):x∈R}andρ=supremum{(1−νA˜(x):x∈R}.Definition 2.3A vague setA˜, defined on the universal set of real numbers R, denoted asA˜=〈[(a,b,c,d);δ,ρ]LR〉, where a≤b≤c≤d and δ≤ρ, is said to be a LR type vague set if degree of membership,μA˜(x), and complement of the degree of non-membership,(1−νA˜(x)), are given byμA˜(x)=δL(b−xb−a),fora<x<bδforb≤x≤cδR(x−cd−c)forc<x<d.and(1−νA˜(x))=ρL(b−xb−a),fora<x<bρforb≤x≤cρR(x−cd−c)forc<x<d.The LR type vague set is a generalization of LR type fuzzy sets, where L and R stands for left membership function and right membership function respectively. LR type vague sets play a significant role in real life problems because it can deal with the uncertainty present within the membership functions. In other words, if the decision maker is not sure about the nature of available data, i.e., linear or non-linear, then LR type vague sets can be the solution.LetA˜=〈[(a1,b1,c1,d1);δ1,ρ1]〉andB˜=〈[(a2,b2,c2,d2);δ2,ρ2]〉be two trapezoidal vague sets, then(i)A˜⊕B˜=〈[(a1+a2,b1+b2,c1+c2,d1+d2);min(δ1,δ2),min(ρ1,ρ2)]〉A˜⊖B˜=〈[(a1−d2,b1−c2,c1−b2,d1−a2);min(δ1,δ2),min(ρ1,ρ2)]〉γA˜=〈[(γa1,γb1,γc1,γd1);δ1,ρ1]〉,γ≥0〈[(γd1,γc1,γb1,γa1);δ1,ρ1]〉,γ≤0A˜øB˜=〈[(a1/d2,b1/c2,c1/b2,d1/a2);min(δ1,δ2),min(ρ1,ρ2)]〉In vague sets division, in order to avoid 0, we must limit 0∉[a2, d2].LetA˜=〈(a1,b1,c1);w1,u1〉andB˜=〈(a2,b2,c2);w2,u2〉be two triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then use the following steps to compareA˜andB˜:Step 1 LetVμ(A˜)synthetically reflect the information on membership degrees,Vν(A˜)synthetically reflect the information on non-membership degrees. Also,Aμ(A˜)andAν(A˜)represent the ambiguities of the membership function μ(x) and the non-membership function ν(x), respectively for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Now, calculateV(A˜,α)=Vμ(A˜)+α(Vν(A˜)−Vμ(A˜)),A(A˜,α)=Aν(A˜)−α(Aν(A˜)−Aμ(A˜))whereVμ(A˜)=(a1+4b1+c1)w16,Vν(A˜)=(a1+4b1+c1)(1−u1)6,Aμ(A˜)=(c1−a1)w13,Aν(A˜)=(c1−a1)(1−u1)3,α∈[0,1]andV(B˜,α)=Vμ(B˜)+α(Vν(B˜)−Vμ(B˜)),A(B˜,α)=Aμ(B˜)−α(Aν(B˜)−Aμ(B˜))whereVμ(B˜)=(a2+4b2+c2)w26,Vν(B˜)=(a2+4b2+c2)(1−u2)6,Aμ(B˜)=(c2−a2)w23,Aν(B˜)=(c2−a2)(1−u2)3,α∈[0,1]Step 2 CalculateR(A˜,α)=V(A˜,α)1+A(A˜,α)andR(B˜,α)=V(B˜,α)1+A(B˜,α)The following three cases may arise:(i)IfR(A˜,α)<R(B˜,α)thenA˜≺B˜∀α∈[0,1],IfR(A˜,α)>R(B˜,α)thenA˜≻B˜∀α∈[0,1],IfR(A˜,α)=R(B˜,α)thenA˜∼B˜∀α∈[0,1].Consider a set of M intuitionistic fuzzy numbers Ai, i∈{1, 2, …, M} with low membership functions μi(x) and high membership functions ϕi(x). By definition, all of the low membership functions μi(x) and all of the high membership functions ϕi(x) are themselves fuzzy numbers. For each pair of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers Ai, Aj, we may calculate “low-low” pairwise ranks, Qjiby ranking μi(x) and μj(x). Calculate,Xjimin(z)=maxz=min(x,y)min(μj(x),μi(y)),Xjimax(z)=maxz=max(x,y)min(μj(x),μi(y)),Q′ji=12(C(μj(x),Xjimin(x))+C(μj(x),Xjimax(x))),Qji=Q′jiQ′ji+Q′ij, where C is any compatibility, similarity or distance operators.Likewise, we may calculate “high-high”, “low-high” and “high-low” pairwise ranks. Sji, Tjiand Wjiby ranking, respectively, ϕi(x) with ϕj(x); μj(x) with ϕi(x) and ϕj(x) with μi(x).Calculate a representative pairwise rank Pjiby averaging Qji, Sji, Tji, Wji:Pji=14(Qji+Sji+Tji+Wji)Then calculate the intuitionistic fuzzy rank ri, i∈{1, 2, …, M}, as follows:ri=∑j=1MPjiforj≠iLet A=([a, b], [c, d]) be an interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy number, and a general accuracy function LG of an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value, based on the unknown degree is defined byLG(A)=membership degree+δ(hesitancy degree)2where δ∈[0, 1] is a parameter depending on the individuals intention. Since hesitancy either favors membership degree or leaves the membership value as it is, δ cannot be negative. An optimistic individual takes δ=1, a pessimistic one takes δ=0. Generally, we can have δ=1/2.LG(A)=a+b+δ(2−a−b−c−d)2i.e.,LG(A)=(a+b)(1−δ)+δ(2−(c+d))2when δ=0, LG(A)=(a+b)/2, when δ=1, LG(A)=(2−c−d)/2, and when δ=(1/2), LG(A)=(2+a+b−c−d)/4.LetA˜=(b1,a1,b2,a2,a3,b3,a4,b4)be a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number with membership and non-membership functions,μA=0,x<a1;x−a1a2−a1,a1≤x≤a2;1,a2≤x≤a3;x−a4a3−a4,a3≤x≤a4;0,a4≤x.andνA=0,x<b1;x−b1b2−b1,b1≤x≤b2;1,b2≤x≤b3;x−b4b3−b4,b3≤x≤b4;0,b4≤x.Also,fA(x)=x−a1a2−a1,gA(x)=x−a4a3−a4,hA(x)=x−b1b2−b1andkA(x)=x−b4b3−b4. The inverses for these shape functions for any r∈[0, 1] arefA−1=a1+(a2−a1)r,gA−1=a4+(a3−a4)r,hA−1=b1+(b2−b1)(1−r),kA−1=b4+(b3−b4)(1−r),Thus, for k∈[0, ∞)Cμk(A˜)=k+12∫01rk[fA−1(r)+gA−1(r)]dr,=a2+a32+(a1−a2)+(a4−a3)2(k+2)andCνk(A˜)=k+12∫01rk[hA−1(r)+kA−1(r)]dr,=b1+b42+(b2−b1)+(b3−b4)2(k+2)Here, we found some shortcomings in existing ranking approaches.Li [20] pointed out the shortcomings of all the existing approaches for the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and proposed a new approach for the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Li ranking approach [20] has the following shortcomings.(i)The existing results, presented in Theorem 1 to Theorem 6 [20], are correct only if bothA˜andB˜are intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with same degree of membership and the same degree of non-membership but in the real life problems, we need to compare the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with different degree of membership and degree of non-membership.If we have two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with unequal degree of membership; and degree of non-membership then the existing approach [20] cannot be used also, in that case the ranking function does not satisfy the reasonable property,A˜≻B˜⇒A˜⊖B˜≻B˜⊖B˜, for the fuzzy quantities [32] i.e.,R(A˜,α)>R(B˜,α)≱R(A˜⊖B˜,α)>R(B˜⊖B˜,α), where α is a index of optimism and α∈[0, 1].Example 3.1LetA˜=〈(1,3,5;0.3,0.2)〉andB˜=〈(4,8,9;0.4,0.1)〉be two triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. According to existing ranking approach [20] the values ofR(A˜,12)andR(B˜,12)are 0.6347 and 0.822 respectively, soA˜≺B˜but the values ofR(A˜⊖B˜)andR(B˜⊖B˜)are −10.2 and 0 respectively which is a contradiction i.e.,R(A˜⊖B˜,12)≯R(B˜⊖B˜,12).Hence, the results, obtained by using the existing ranking approach [20], are valid for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with equal degree of membership and degree of non-membership.In some cases, the existing approach [20] indicates that the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers depends upon degree of membership and degree of non-membership of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers while in several cases the ranking does not depend upon degree of membership and degree of non-membership of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.LetA˜=〈(a1,a2,a3;w1,u1)〉andB˜=〈(a1,a2,a3;w2,u2)〉be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then according to the existing approach [20]Case (i) If (a1+4a2+a3)≠0, thenA˜≺B˜,ifR(A˜,α)<R(B˜,α)A˜≻B˜,ifR(A˜,α)>R(B˜,α)A˜∼B˜,ifR(A˜,α)=R(B˜,α)Case (ii) If (a1+4a2+a3)=0, thenA˜∼B˜for all values ofw1, u1,w2and u2.Example 3.2LetA˜=〈(−2,0,2;w1,u1)〉andB˜=〈(−2,0,2;w2,u2)〉be two intuitionitsic fuzzy numbers, then according to the existing approach [20]A˜∼B˜for all values ofw1, u2,w2and u2.Example 3.3LetA˜=〈(−8,1,4;w1,u1)〉andB˜=〈(−8,1,4;w2,u2)〉be two intuitionitsic fuzzy numbers, then according to the existing approach [20]A˜∼B˜for all values ofw1, u2,w2and u2.Example 3.4LetA˜=〈(1,1,1;w1,u1)〉andB˜=〈(1,1,1;w2,u2)〉be two intuitionitsic fuzzy numbers, then according to the existing approach [20]A˜≺B˜ifα(1−u1)+(1−α)w1<α(1−u2)+(1−α)w2A˜≻B˜α(1−u1)+(1−α)w1>α(1−u2)+(1−α)w2A˜∼B˜α(1−u1)+(1−α)w1=α(1−u2)+(1−α)w2.According to the existing approach [20], Case (i) shows that ranking of fuzzy numbers depends upon degree of membership and degree of non-membership of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers while Case (ii) shows that ranking does not depend upon degree of membership and degree of non-membership of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which is again not reasonable.Mitchell [23] in 2004 proposed a ranking method for the ordering of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Mitchell's ranking method has the following limitations.(i)The output value, rmof the ranking method is a crisp number, and is not an integer. Therefore, these ranking values need to be sorted in order to find the correct ranking.To find the value of rm, we need to evaluate the total of M intuitionistic fuzzy number ranking. For the large set of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers i.e., large value of m reduces the speed of the algorithm.Since there are random numbers involved in the ranking method, of Michell's, which make the final rank rmas a random value and will change from experiment to experiment.Because of the random nature of the Mitchell's ranking method, it only satisfies only one reasonable property.Nayagam et al. [24] suggested that several generalizations of fuzzy set theory for various objectives, the notions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are interesting and very useful in modeling real life problems. The ranking of fuzzy numbers was studied by many authors and it was extended to intuitionistic fuzzy sets because of its attraction and applicability. They proposed a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and pointed that the ranking of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets plays a vital role in decision-making, data analysis, artificial intelligence and socioeconomic system where the interval analysis is essential. But Nayagam et al.'s method [24] gives counter-intuitive case and is unable to provide reasonable ranking between interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Following are some counter examples.Example 3.5LetA˜1=([0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2])andA˜2=([0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3])be two interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then, Nayagam et al.'s method [24] give the result,A˜1=A˜2,which is not reasonable.Example 3.6LetA˜1=([0.6,0.6],[0.7,0.7])andA˜2=([0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2])be two interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then, Nayagam et al.'s method [24] gives the result,A˜1=A˜2,which is not reasonable.Nehi proposed a method for the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers by considering two characteristic values of membership and non-membership functions. These values are defined by the integral of the inverse fuzzy membership and non-membership functions multiplied by the grade with powered parameter.LetA˜=(b1,a1,b2,a2,a3,b3,a4,b4)be intuitionistic fuzzy number. According to Nehi's ranking approach [25], characteristic values of membership and non-membership for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with parameter k are denoted byCμk(A˜)=a2+a32+(a1−a2)+(a4−a3)2(k+2)andCνk(A˜)=b1+b42+(b2−b1)+(b3−b4)2(k+2)Nehi's ranking approach [25] does not give reasonable ranking results in all cases. Following examples reflect the shortcomings of Nehi's ranking approach [25]:Example 3.7LetA˜=(−3,−2,−1,0,0,1,2,3),B˜=(−5,−4,−3,0,0,3,4,5)be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then, according to Nehi's ranking approach [25], for k=0,Cμ0(A˜)=0,Cν0(A˜)=0andCμ0(B˜)=0,Cν0(B˜)=0⇒A˜=B˜, which is absurd.Example 3.8LetA˜=(−4,−3,0,0,0,0,3,4),B˜=(−9,−8,0,0,0,0,8,9)be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then, according to Nehi's ranking approach [25], for k=0,Cμ0(A˜)=0,Cν0(A˜)=0andCμ0(B˜)=0,Cν0(B˜)=0⇒A˜=B˜, which is absurd.LetA˜=〈[(a1,b1,c1,d1);δ1,ρ1]L1R1〉andB˜=〈[(a2,b2,c2,d2);δ2,ρ2]L2R2〉be two L-R type vague sets, where a1≤b1≤c1≤d1, δ1≤ρ1 and a2≤b2≤c2≤d2, δ2≤ρ2, then use the following steps to compareA˜andB˜:Step 1 TransformA˜,B˜intoA˜*,B˜*as follows:(1)A˜*=〈[(a1,b1,c1,d1);δ,ρ]L1R1〉,B˜*=〈[(a2,b2,c2,d2);δ,ρ]L2R2〉where δ=min(δ1, δ2) and ρ=min(ρ1, ρ2)Step 2 Let membership function and non-membership function ofA˜*andB˜*beμA˜*(x),μB˜*(x)and(1−νA˜*(x)),(1−νB˜*(x))respectively, whereμA˜*(x)=δ1L1b1−xb1−a1,fora1<x<b1δ1forb1≤x≤c1δ1R1x−c1d1−c1forc1<x<d1.,μB˜*(x)=δ2L2b2−xb2−a2,fora2<x<b2δ2forb2≤x≤c2δ2R2x−c2d2−c2forc2<x<d2.and(1−νA˜*(x))=ρ1L1b1−xb1−a1,fora1<x<b1ρ1forb1≤x≤c1ρ1R1x−c1d1−c1forc1<x<d1.,(1−νB˜*(x))=ρ2L2b2−xb2−a2,fora2<x<b2ρ2forb2≤x≤c2ρ2R2x−c2d2−c2forc2<x<d2.Let α and β represent the membership value and non-membership value, respectively, which is common for bothA˜*andB˜*, then α∈(0, δ], β∈(0, ρ] where δ=min(δ1, δ2), ρ=min(ρ1, ρ2). Therefore, membership function and non-membership function ofA˜*andB˜*become,μA˜*(x)=δL1b1−xb1−a1,fora1<x<b1δforb1≤x≤c1δR1x−c1d1−c1forc1<x<d1.,μB˜*(x)=δL2b2−xb2−a2,fora2<x<b2δforb2≤x≤c2δR2x−c2d2−c2forc2<x<d2.and(1−νA˜*(x))=ρL1b1−xb1−a1,fora1<x<b1ρforb1≤x≤c1ρR1x−c1d1−c1forc1<x<d1.,(1−νB˜*(x))=ρL2b2−xb2−a2,fora2<x<b2ρforb2≤x≤c2ρR2x−c2d2−c2forc2<x<d2.For truth membership part, letδL1(b1−xb1−a1)=α⇒b1−xb1−a1=L1−1(αδ)⇒x=b1−(b1−a1)L1−1(αδ)andδR1(x−c1d1−c1)=α⇒x−c1d1−c1=R1−1(αδ)⇒x=c1+(d1−c1)R1−1(αδ)(2)∴RTλ(A˜δ*)=λ∫0δ(b1−(b1−a1)L1−1αδ)dα+(1−λ)∫0δ(c1+(d1−c1)R1−1αδ)dαFor non-membership part, letρL1(b1−xb1−a1)=β⇒b1−xb1−a1=L1−1(βρ)⇒x=b1−(b1−a1)L1−1(βρ)andρR1(x−c1d1−c1)=β⇒x−c1d1−c1=R1−1(βρ)⇒x=c1+(d1−c1)R1−1(βρ)(3)∴RTλ(A˜ρ−δ*)=λ∫δρb1−(b1−a1)L1−1βρdβ+(1−λ)∫δρc1+(d1−c1)R1−1βρdβNow(4)RTλ(A˜*)=RTλ(A˜δ*)+RTλ(A˜ρ−δ*)=λ[∫0δb1−(b1−a1)L1−1αδdα+∫δρb1−(b1−a1)L1−1βρdβ]+(1−λ)[∫0δc1+(d1−c1)R1−1αδdα+∫δρc1+(d1−c1)R1−1βρdβ]Similarly(5)RTλ(B˜*)=RTλ(B˜δ*)+RTλ(B˜ρ−δ*)=λ[∫0δb2−(b2−a2)L2−1αδdα+∫δρb2−(b2−a2)L2−1βρdβ]+(1−λ)[∫0δc2+(d2−c2)R2−1αδdα+∫δρc2+(d2−c2)R2−1βρdβ]Step 3 CheckRTλ(A˜*)>RTλ(B˜*)orRTλ(A˜*)<RTλ(B˜*)orRTλ(A˜*)=RTλ(B˜*)Case (i) IfRTλ(A˜*)>RTλ(B˜*), thenA˜≻B˜∀λ∈[0,1].Case (ii) IfRTλ(A˜*)<RTλ(B˜*), thenA˜≺B˜∀λ∈[0,1].Case (iii) IfRTλ(A˜*)=RTλ(B˜*), thenA˜∼B˜∀λ∈[0,1].It can be easily shown that the proposed ranking formula for the ordering of vague sets is generalization of existing ranking approaches [1,21].Case (i) If L(x)=R(x)=maximum(0, 1−x), α=β, then (4) reduces toRTλ(A˜*)=λδ(a1+b1)2+(ρ−δ)2b1+a1+δρ(b1−a1)+(1−λ)δ(c1+d1)2+(ρ−δ)2c1+d1+δρ(d1−c1)Case (ii) If L(x)=R(x)=maximum(0, 1−x), α=β and 0≤δ=ρ≤1, then (4) reduces toR(A˜)=δλ(a1+b1)2+(1−λ)(c1+d1)2which is the ranking formula for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers [21].Case (iii) If L(x)=R(x)=maximum(0, 1−x), α=β, 0≤δ=ρ≤1 and b1=c1, then (4) reduces toR(A˜)=δλ(a1+b1)2+(1−λ)(b1+d1)2which is the ranking formula for generalized triangular fuzzy numbers [21].Case (iv) If L(x)=R(x)=maximum(0, 1−x), α=β, 0≤δ=ρ=1, then (4) reduces toR(A˜)=λ(a1+b1)2+(1−λ)(c1+d1)2which is the ranking formula for normal trapezoidal fuzzy numbers [1,21].Case (v) If L(x)=R(x)=maximum(0, 1−x), α=β, 0≤δ=ρ=1 and b1=c1, then (4) reduces toR(A˜)=λ(a1+b1)2+(1−λ)(b1+d1)2which is the ranking formula for normal triangular fuzzy numbers [1,21].Wang and Kerre [32] proposed some axioms as reasonable properties of ordering fuzzy quantities for the ranking approachR.

To illustrate the proposed approach given in this paper, a practical example of compressor system is considered. The first step is construction of the fault tree of a compressor system that allows the definition of the functional/logical links between the equipment subsystems. The different components of a compressor are represented by different symbols that are shown in Table 2. The fault tree of the system is shown in Fig. 2, and was divided into seven main subsystems. Those subsystems are further divided into thirteen basic components as shown in Table 3, each one performing a specific function in connection with the subsystem main function. A failure in a component at the bottom of the fault tree affects all subsystems above it, causing a possible degradation in the system operation. The fault tree was developed according to the operation manual furnished by the manufacturer.The second step is to apply the vague set theory for evaluating the risk analysis of the compressor system. In this analysis, two evaluating terms (R) and (W) are used, where (R) denotes the probability of failure and (W) denotes the severity of loss. The probability of failure (R) of a system is evaluated as a function of mean time between failure MTBF, and severity of loss (W) is assessed by the possible outcome of failure effects on the system i.e. MTTR. Depending upon the values of MTBF and MTTR values of the sub-components, the (R˜ij) and (W˜ij) may be regarded as linguistic terms (i.e. absolute-low and very-low), where i=A, B, C, … and j=1, 2, 3, …. These linguistic terms are further used to evaluate the vague probability of failure (R˜i) of each component with respect to its sub-components as proposed in Chen and Chen [5] which is shown below:(6)R˜i=∑j=1nR˜ij⊗W˜ij∑j=1nW˜ijThe seven-member linguistic terms set, shown in Table 4, is used for representing the linguistic terms and their corresponding vague sets. The linguistic values of evaluating items (R˜ij) and (W˜ij) of the sub-components are shown in Table 5, where (wR˜ij) denotes the degree of confidence of the experts opinion with respect to each sub-components of the system. The algorithm, proposed in Chen and Chen [5], is used to evaluate the vague probability of failure (R˜i) of each component of the compressor system and is presented as follows.Step 1 Aggregate theR˜ijandW˜ijof each sub-component of the fault tree based on vague set arithmetic operations given in Section 2.2 and Eq. (6) into the vague probability of failureR˜iof each component, as shown below:R˜A=[R˜A1⊗W˜A1⊕R˜A2⊗W˜A2⊕R˜A3⊗W˜A3]ø[W˜A1⊕W˜A2⊕W˜A2]R˜C=[R˜C1⊗W˜C1⊕R˜C2⊗W˜C2⊕R˜C3⊗W˜C3⊕R˜D1⊗W˜D1⊕R˜F1⊗W˜F1⊕R˜F2⊗W˜F2⊕R˜F3⊗W˜F3]ø[W˜C1⊕W˜C2⊕W˜C3⊕W˜D1⊕W˜F1⊕W˜F2⊕W˜F3]R˜D=[R˜D1⊗W˜D1⊕R˜F1⊗W˜F1⊕R˜F2⊗W˜F2⊕R˜F3⊗W˜F3]ø[W˜D1⊕W˜F1⊕W˜F2⊕W˜F3]R˜E=[R˜E1⊗W˜E1⊕R˜E2⊗W˜E2⊕R˜E3⊗W˜E3]ø[W˜E1⊕W˜E2⊕W˜E3]R˜F=[R˜F1⊗W˜F1⊕R˜F2⊗W˜F2⊕R˜F3⊗W˜F3]ø[W˜F1⊕W˜F2⊕W˜F3]Step 2: Using Tables 4 and 5 the values of probability of failureR˜iof each component are:R˜A=〈[(0.04,0.16,0.16,0.37);0.375,0.65]〉R˜C=〈[(0.05,0.17,0.17,0.41);0.32,0.65]〉R˜D=〈[(0.05,0.18,0.17,0.44);0.32,0.65]〉R˜E=〈[(0.11,0.27,0.27,0.58);0.45,0.8]〉R˜F=〈[(0.04,0.16,0.16,0.37);0.35,0.65]〉Step 3 Based on Eq. (5), calculate the rank ofR(R˜i)of each component of the compressor system. The larger the value ofR(R˜i), the higher the probability of failure of component of a compressor system, as shown as below:R(R˜A)=0.2038;R(R˜C)=0.2232;R(R˜D)=0.2378;R(R˜E)=0.3365;R(R˜F)=0.2038Because ofR(R˜E)>R(R˜D)>R(R˜C)>R(R˜A)=R(R˜F), the ranking order of each vague set is RE>RD>RC>RA=RF. This concludes that the component E has the highest probability of failure, then followed by D,C,A=F.
