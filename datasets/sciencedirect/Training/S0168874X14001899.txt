In the present work an aero-elastic model is presented to study flutter and divergence of isotropic plate wings. A finite element model is subsequently developed to apply the theoretical model and predict the performance of plate wings. A divergence analysis is carried out using the finite element model combined with the vortex lattice method for aerodynamic load calculations. The flutter analysis is carried out using a finite element model combined with the doublet lattice method. The aerodynamic model is coupled to the structural model using the shape (interpolation) functions of the finite element model. Static condensation is used to express the finite elements’ in-plane degrees of freedom in terms of the bending ones, hence reducing the number of the elements’ degrees of freedom per node to three. A MATLAB code is developed to implement the proposed model using three-node triangular finite elements. The present model is validated using benchmark problems available in the literature, and the effects of taper ratio on both divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency are studied.Definitionunsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrixaerodynamic panel areaunsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrix in structural coordinatessteady aerodynamic coefficient matrix in structural coordinatessteady aerodynamic coefficient matrix at the aerodynamic panelsstrain–displacement matrixstress–strain matrixaerodynamic panel length along spanload vectorstiffness matrixelement stiffness matrix in local coordinateselement area coordinatesmass matrixelement mass matrix in local coordinatesshape function matrixdisplacement vectorstructural bending displacement vectorelement local coordinatesstructural global coordinateswing damping ratiomassstrain energyelasticity modulus of the wing materialvolumereduced frequencyshape function numerical integration matrixshear modulusinterpolation matrix using shape function for divergence analysisflutter boundary condition matrixair densitykinetic energyflutter frequencyplate wing thicknessreference length (half the wing root chord)stressinterpolation matrix using shape function for flutter analysisflow speeddynamic pressurestrain

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the most powerful methods used to study the behavior of structures is the finite element method. The idea of the finite element method is based on discretizing the structure into small elements in which the solution can be approximated using simple interpolation functions. All the elements are assembled together to construct a system of equations relating the loads to the degrees of freedom of the whole structure. Many researchers used the finite element method to study the aero-elastic characteristics of aircraft structures.Cole [1] developed a model to study the divergence of wings with high aspect ratios. The results were compared with experimental data. The results showed that the divergence speed decreases with the increase of the forward sweep angle of the wing. Lee and Lee [2] performed a vibration study for composite plate wings. The wings considered in the study had different sweep back angles and taper ratios. The effect of fiber orientations was investigated. The finite element model was built using four and eight-node quadrilateral elements. The results were validated by comparison to experimental results. Shokrieh and Behrooz [3], studied the dynamic instability of a wing using NISA finite element program [4]. The purpose of this work was to ensure that the wing was safe from flutter within the wing speed range based on the Joint Aviation requirements (JAR-23) [5]. Koo [6] performed static and dynamic aero-elastic analyses for isotropic plate wings with different sweep back angles. Furthermore, he studied the effect of different double-sweep wing angles on flutter and divergence. A finite element model was used together with the doublet lattice method using the surface spline method. The effect of different fiber orientations was demonstrated. Moosavi [7] introduced a model to calculate the flutter speed for wings using Galerkin’s method. The model used the finite element method in the structural analysis and the strip theory in the aerodynamic analysis. Su and Cesnik [8] examined a flying wing aero-elastic characteristics using the finite element method. The finite element model was built using a non-linear beam model, and the 2D finite state inflow theory was used in the aerodynamic model.Hollowell and Dugundji [9] demonstrated experimental and analytical analyses for a composite plate wing. An experimental investigation was carried out for a cantilever plate wing with different fiber orientations. The results of the analytical analysis were compared with the experimental ones and showed good agreement. An instability analysis was carried out using the V-g method [10]. Kameyama and Fukunaga [11] introduced an analysis and design for a composite plate wing using the genetic algorithm. The finite element method was used to obtain the structure stiffness matrix, and the doublet lattice method was used for the aerodynamic analysis. The instability analysis was carried out using the p–k method [12]. The results were compared with the experimental data obtained in Hollowell and Dugundji [9]. Moon [13] used multidisciplinary optimization to improve the wing divergence speed using the vortex lattice to derive the aerodynamic coefficient matrix and the finite element method to obtain the wing stiffness matrix. The wing box was approximated by an equivalent flat plate. The design objective was to minimize the aircraft weight under divergence and flutter speeds constraints. The proposed optimization model resulted in a significant improvement in the wing flutter speed. Recently, Leon [14] used aero-elastic tailoring to improve the flutter speed of a composite plate wing using topology optimization. The aero-dynamic analysis was made using the doublet lattice method, and the structural analysis was made using the finite element method. The Spline method was used to connect between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model. The V–g method was used to calculate the flutter speed. The aero-elastic stability analysis was performed using Zaero software package [15].Patil and Hodges [16] presented a theory for the aero-elastic analysis of highly flexible flying wing aircrafts. The structural analysis is performed using beam model while the aerodynamic analysis is obtained using the 2-D aerodynamic theories. The solution of the aero-elastic equation was obtained using Newton–Raphson method. A nonlinear simulation was obtained for the flying wing aircraft. Kennedy and Martins in 2014 [17] a 3-D aero-structural optimization model. The aerodynamic analysis is obtained using a 3-D panel code while the structural analysis is performed using a finite element code. They developed a general model to connect between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model. The parallel Newton–Krylov method was used to sole the aero-structural equations. They performed an aero-structural optimization for a real wing.The aim of this work is to study the effect of wing taper ratio on the static and dynamic instabilities of the wing. Complete structural and aerodynamic models are developed and coupled together to perform the required instability analyses. A MATLAB code is developed for the aerodynamic, finite element, and aero-elastic analysis which uses the shape function transformation to couple between the aerodynamic and the finite element models.Two Aero-elastic models are developed to study the interaction between inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces. There are two types of aero-elastic phenomena: The first one represents the interaction between steady aerodynamic forces and static structural elastic forces, which is known as static aero-elasticity, and the second one represents the interaction between the unsteady aerodynamic forces and the structural elastic and inertial forces, which is known as dynamic aero-elasticity (flutter).In the aerodynamic analysis the steady and the unsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrices are developed.There are various methods used to determine the aerodynamic forces on lifting surfaces. One of the simplest and most accurate methods is the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). In this section a steady aerodynamic model is developed for the calculation of the wing static loads needed for divergence analysis.In the VLM, the plan-form of the wing is divided into panels (elements). Each panel is replaced by a horseshoe vortex. This horseshoe vortex has a vortex filament across the quarter-chord of the panel and two filaments stream-wise, one on each side of the panel starting at the quarter-chord and trailing downstream in the free-stream direction to infinity.Fig. 1 shows a typical horseshoe-vortex representation of a wing plan-form. The boundary condition for each horseshoe vortex is satisfied by requiring the inclination of the fluid streamline to match the angle of attack at the three-quarter-chord point of its elemental panel. The circulations required to satisfy this tangent flow boundary condition are then determined by solving a matrix equation.(1)wm=−U∞αwhere α is the angle of attack at the control points of the aerodynamic mesh.We can calculate the Influence coefficient matrix by calculating the down-wash velocity at each control point by determining the relative influence of the singularities of a planar wing based on their geometric position [23] as seen in Fig. 1.(2)wm.n=Γn4π{1(xm−x1n)(ym−y2n)−(xm−x2n)(ym−y1n)⁎[(x2n−x1n)(xm−x1n)+(y2n−y1n)(ym−y1n)(xm−x1n)2+(ym−y1n)2−(x2n−x1n)(xm−x2n)+(y2n−y1n)(ym−y2n)(xm−x2n)2+(ym−y2n)2]+1y1n−ym[1+xm−x1n(xm−x1n)2+(ym−y1n)2]−1y2n−ym[1+xm−x2n(xm−x2n)2+(ym−y2n)2]}Summing up the contributions of all vortices to the downwash at the control point of the mth panel:(3)wm=∑n=12nwm,nwhere n is the number of panels on the wing half, andwm=AvlmΓ. Finally, we have a system of n equations in the strength distribution, which can be solved to get the vortex strength distribution Γ.Then, the lift distribution according to Biot–Savart law is given by(4)L=ρ∞U∞ΔyΓThe pressure distribution is then calculated from(5)Ppanel=LpanelApanelThe doublet lattice method [18] is based on a linear theory using a numerical approach to study subsonic three-dimensional flows past complex lifting surfaces. The wing surface is divided into n panels. The downwash, wi, induced on the control point of the ith panel by the doublet lines of the panels j=1, 2, 3,…,n, shown inFig. 2, can be expressed as follows:(6)w¯i=∑j=1nADlmijΔP¯jhere, ADlmijis written in terms of the numerical integrals over the Kernel function [18], and then we can formulate ADlmas in Ref. [19](7)ADlmij=−Δcj4πρU∞[2eη2−e2(η2A2+ηA1+A0)+(ηA2+A12)log(η−eη+e)2+2eA2]where,e=Δy2,A0=Km¯,A1=1Δy[K0¯−Ki¯],A2=12e2(K0¯−2Km¯+Ki¯),K¯=K1e−iωx0/U∞K1=−I1−Mr1Re−ik1u11+u12,r1=abs(ηsm),R=ξ2+β2η2,k1=ωr1U∞u1=MR−ξr1β2,I1=∫u1∞e−ik1u(1+u2)3/2du,ξ=xR−xsm,η=yR−ysm,κ=ωbrU∞More details about the derivation of the unsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrix ADlmand the evaluation of the integral I1 can be found in Ref. [19].The finite element model is built using a three node triangular shell element with five degrees of freedom per node, q, (u, v, w,θx,θy) as shown inFig. 3. These degrees of freedom include in-plane and bending actions, which are subsequently reduced using static condensation to the three bending degrees of freedom (w,θx,θy) required for the aero-elastic analysis. The element stiffness matrix is built up first in its area coordinates (L1, L2, L3), then transformed to local coordinates (x, y, z) using the Jacobian matrix, and finally transformed and assembled in the wing global coordinates (X, Y, Z) using transformation matrix [20].The stiffness matrix for the in-plane and bending actions is derived from the element strain energy Λe, which takes the form [21](8)Λe=12∫VσTεdV=12∫VεTDεdV=12∫VqTBTDBqdVwhereσis the element stress components,εis the element strain components, D is the stress–strain matrix, B is the strain–displacement matrix, and q is the vector of element degrees of freedom.On the other hand the mass matrix is derived from the kinetic energy as in Ref. [22](9)KEe=12∫(u̇2+v̇2+ẇ2)dm=12ρ∫V(u̇2+v̇2+ẇ2)dVwhereρis the material density. Assuming the wing is built of an isotropic material, the stress strain matrix is(10)D=E1−ν2[1ν0ν10001−ν2]where E is the elasticity modulus andvis Poisson’s ratio. Then the element stiffness and mass matrices in case of metallic wings take the forms;For in-plane action(11)Kp=∭BpTDBpdV=t∫01∫11-L2BpTDBp|J|dL1dL2=t|J|2BpTDBp(12)Mp=ρt∬NpTNpdAwhere the subscript p denotes in-plane action. For the bending action(13)Kb=∭BbTDBbdV=∭BbTDBbdzdAwhere the matrix Bbdefined in terms of the vertical displacement and the shape function as(14)ε=−z{∂2w∂x2∂2w∂y22∂2w∂x∂y}=−z{∂2Nb(1)∂x2∂2Nb(1)∂y22∂2Nb(1)∂x∂y}wn=Bbwnwhere wnis the nodal degrees of freedom, Npis the shape functions matrix for the in-plane action which connects between the general in-plane displacements (u, v) and the in-plane nodal displacements and Nbis the shape functions matrix for the bending action which connects between the general bending displacements (w,θx,θy) and the bending nodal displacements wn. Nn(1) is the first row of the shapes functions matrix Nbwhich connects between the vertical displacementwand the nodal displacements wn.By integrating the matrix Bbrelative to z and transform the coordinates to the element area coordinates using the Jacobian transformation, Eq. (14) takes the form.(15)Kb=∫−t2t2z2dz∫01∫11-L2BbT−zDBb−z|J|dL1dL2=t312∫01∫11-L2BbT−zDBb−z|J|dL1dL2(16)Mb=∭NbTINbdm=∫01∫11-L2NbTINbT|J|dL1dL2where the I matrix is given in Ref. [22] as(17)I=ρ[t000t312000t312]All the integrations over the triangular elements to predict the stiffness and mass matrices are done using cubic Gauss numerical integration [20].The shape function for the reference element under in-plane action Npis given in Ref. [21] and the shape function for the bending action Nbis given in Ref. [20].The stiffness and mass matrices are calculated for each element in local coordinates combining the in-plane and bending actions, then they are assembled and transformed to the global coordinate system XYZ[20].(18)Ke=[Kpe000Kbe0000],Me=[Mpe000Mbe0000]The zeroes on the diagonals correspond to the 6th degree of freedom (drilling degree of freedom) defined in Ref. [20].To study wing flutter and divergence, one needs only the bending degrees of freedom (w,θx,θy). Therefore the five degrees of freedom in q are reduced to the bending degrees of freedom wsusing static condensation as shown in Appendix A. Thus, we have the stiffness and mass matrices expressed in terms of the bending degrees of freedom. The whole wing structure can be represented by the following system of equations:(19)Mw¨s+Kws=Fwhere K is the stiffness matrix, M is the mass matrix, and F is the aerodynamic loads at the finite element nodes.In the present work, we study two kinds of wing instability. The first is the static instability known as divergence, and the other is the dynamic instability known as flutter. In case of divergence Eq. (10) reduces to(20)Kws=Fwsis the structural bending degrees of freedom:(21)ws={wθxθy}The aerodynamic loads are obtained using the vortex lattice method [23], and then transformed to the structural coordinates using the shape functions. Thus, an eigenvalue problem is obtained which can be solved to obtain the divergence dynamic pressure, and hence the divergence speed:(22)(K−q∞Ass)ws=0whereq∞is the flow dynamic pressure defined in Eq. (14) and Assis the aerodynamic influence coefficient (AIC) matrix at the finite element nodes (structural coordinates), which is calculated using the vortex lattice method [23] and then transformed to the finite element nodes using the shape function transformation.(23)q∞=12ρU∞2Eq. (13) is an eigenvalue problem which has a nonzero solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero,(24)|K−q∞Ass|=0It is desired to solve this equation to calculate the divergence dynamic pressure, which is the lowest positive real eigenvalue.Another form of aero-elastic instability is the dynamic instability which is known as flutter. In case of flutter, Eq. (10) takes the form,(25)−Mω2ws+Kws=q∞Asdwswhere Asd is the unsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrix at the structural coordinates, which can be calculated using the doublet lattice method [24,25] and then transformed to the structural coordinates using the shape function transformation as will be shown later, ω is the structural frequency, andq∞is the dynamic pressure:By substituting Eq. (14) into (16) and then(26)(M+1ω2K−12ρU∞2ω2Asd)ws=0The term known as the reduced frequency is defined as(27)k=bωU∞It is required to find out omega, which is a complex eigen-value, at which flutter occurs. By substituting k into Eq. (17) and rearranging we get,(28)(K−1(M+ρb22k2Asd)−1+iζω2I)ws=0where ζ is the structural damping. Using Eq. (16), the flutter speed is obtained at zero damping. In Eq. (16), one needs to get the speed and frequency at which the flutter occurs. It is obvious that the reduced frequency k depends on the frequency omega and speed Uinf. Therefore, an iterative technique is used to find the flutter speed. This method is known as the V–g method [10], in which a range of reduced frequencies is assumed and the flow speed and structural frequency are calculated. Flutter occurs when damping vanishes. The developed model can also implement the p–k method [26] and is expected to give more accurate results [26].For simplification, it is assumed that the unsteady aerodynamic matrices have no effect on the mass matrix and the effect on damping is negligible like in Ref. [11,14].In this article, the aerodynamic model and the finite element model are coupled. It is desired to transform the pressure distribution from the aerodynamic model to the finite element model to predict the deformations. On the other hand, the structure deformations calculated from the finite element model affect the loads predicted by the aerodynamic model. This process goes back and forth until the “operating conditions” for the wing are reached. There are many ways which can be used to perform this coupling. Spline methods are often used [27]. In this paper, we use the interpolation (shape) functions used in the finite element model to map the aerodynamic loads to the finite element mesh.Hence, the use of the finite element shape functions is twofold; first to integrate the pressure from the aerodynamic model to the finite element one using numerical integration, and second to transform the displacements from the finite element model to the aerodynamic one. These two functions of the interpolation functions result in the generation of two matrices GN1eand GN2e, which are obtained for each triangular element, assembled in GN1and GN2, and then transformed to the structure global coordinates. There are two forms for these matrices in the divergence and flutter analyses.In case of divergence analysis,(29)Ass=-dyApanelGN1AVlm-1GN2dwhere GN1is assembled to connect the pressure distribution with the equivalent nodal forces while GN2dis assembled to connect between the wing angle of attack at the aerodynamic control points and the nodal displacements at the finite element mesh. Both GN1and GN2dare calculated using the triangular element shape functions.For the triangular element in bending the shape functions N connect between the surface pressure and the equivalent nodal forces:(30)Fe=∬NeTPedswhere Ferepresents the equivalent nodal forces and P represents the element surface pressure vector. The present integration is performed using numerical integration [20], then the resulting shape functions matrix is assembled and transformed to connect between the global nodal forces and the global pressure distribution (from the aerodynamic model) where(31)F=GN1PGN1is the assembly matrix of N transpose.Similar to GN1, GN2dis calculated to connect between the aerodynamic angle of attack α and the nodal displacements ws. The shape functions N is used as an interpolation matrix where(32)wse=∑i=1nNeTαn represents the number of the aerodynamic control points on each element. Then the matrix N is assembled and transformed to the global coordinates to connect between the global nodal displacements wsand the aerodynamic angle of attack at each control point.(33)ws=GN2dαFor flutter analysis,(34)Asd=GN1ADlm-1BcGN2fwhere Bc represents the boundary condition matrix which connects between the up-wash velocity and the displacements(wa,θya)at the aerodynamic panels, which are connected with the finite element displacements(w,θx,θy)using GN2f, which is derived similar to GN2d.(35)Bc=[I×kb,−1]whereI=−1, k is the reduced frequency (defined in Eq. 18), and b is a reference length.Fig. 4 shows a wing structure discretized into finite elements. The finite element nodes are represented by the solid circles. The aerodynamic control points, where the aerodynamic loads are calculated, are represented by crosses. Using GN1and GN2, the aerodynamic matrix can be transformed from the aerodynamic panels’ control points to the finite element nodes.A computer code is developed based on the presented model using MATLAB [28]. The geometry of the plate wing and the material properties are inputs to the code. The finite element mesh is generated by defining the location of the nodes and connectivity of the elements.Fig. 5 represents a flow chart which explains how this program works.In the present model a liner 3-node triangular element is used. The steady aerodynamic load is obtained using the vortex lattice method, and the unsteady aerodynamic load is obtained using the doublet lattice method. The optimum number of elements was obtained for both the structure and steady and unsteady aerodynamic analyses through experimentation with the model.To test the present model the results are compared with those obtained in reference [6]. The results are obtained for a straight isotropic wing with different sweep angles. The wing has the geometry described inFig. 6 with thickness t of 1mm. The wing material has an elasticity modulus E of 73.8Gpa, shear modulus G of 27.6Gpa, and density rho of 2768kg/m3.Fig. 7 shows the finite element mesh consisting of (48) elements. The aerodynamic control points are represented by crosses. The number of the finite elements and the aerodynamic elements have been chosen based on a convergence analysis and comparison with experimental results of Ref. [6].Table 1 shows the divergence and flutter speeds at different sweep angles, where the positive angles represent sweep-back and the negative angles represent sweep-forward, for the present model as compared with those of Ref. [6]. It is seen that for forward-swept wings divergence occurs before flutter, and for back-ward swept wings flutter occurs before divergence. The results from the present model show reasonable agreement with the published results in Ref. [6]. The differences between both models vary with the sweep angle, and may be attributed to the following reasons. First, the present model used the vortex lattice method for steady aerodynamic analysis and the doublet lattice method for unsteady aerodynamic analysis, while in the other model the doublet point method was used for both the static and dynamic analyses. Second, the coupling between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model in the present work is performed using the finite element shape functions, which is expected to produce more accurate results compared with the infinite spline method used in Ref. [6].The present model and the developed program are designed to analyze wings having different geometries including wings with different sweep angles and taper ratios. In this section, the effect of taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds is studied, on a straight plate wing with different taper ratios as shown inFig. 8.Table 2 shows the effect of taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency. The study is carried out for different taper ratios (TR), where TR=Ct/Cr, ranging from 1 (untapered wing) to 0.2 (highly tapered wing). It is clear from the results that increasing the taper (TR decreases) results in increasing the divergence speed, flutter speed and flutter frequency, which means better wing stability characteristics.The above calculation have been repeated keeping the wing area unchanged while changing the wing taper ratio.Table 3 gives the results of study. It is seen that while the results are different from those of Table 2, they have the same trends.A finite element model is developed to analyze the behavior of isotropic plate wings with different geometries subjected to aerodynamic loading. The developed model takes into account the aero-elastic interaction between the structural deformations and the aerodynamic loads. An accurate technique for mapping the loads calculated at the aerodynamic control points to the finite element mesh is proposed. In this technique the shape functions of the finite element model are used to perform this mapping. It is assumed that the proposed mapping is more consistent, and hence is expected to produce more accurate results as compared to other methods using simple interpolation methods. The model is customized to predict the divergence and flutter speeds of isotropic plate wings. The vortex lattice method is used for the steady aerodynamic analysis, while the doublet lattice method is used for unsteady aerodynamic analysisThe validity of the proposed model is tested by comparing the model predictions of flutter and divergence speeds for untapered wing with different sweep angles to those of other models in the literature. The results are in good agreement with some differences attributed to (1) using the vortex lattice method and the doublet lattice method in the present model as compared to the doublet point method in the other models, and (2) using the finite element shape functions to couple the aerodynamic and the finite element models as compared to the infinite spline method in other models. Both reasons suggest that the results of the present model are more accurate.The model is also used to study the effect of the plate wing taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds. The effect of taper ratio is studied for twice; once with constant wing span Table 2, and once with constant wing area Table 3. In the first case, there are significant increase in the divergence and flutter speeds of the plate wing with the increases of the wing taper. This is consistent because the increase in wing taper decreases the area of the wing tip, which increases the stiffness of the wing that leads to the increase in the wing divergence and flutter speeds. In the second case, the divergence speed first increased and then decreased, and finally increased again, while the flutter speed decreased then increased and finally decreased again. The critical speed in this case is always the flutter speed. That is because the wing area is constant and the increase in wing taper, which decrease the wing area at the tip and increase the wing stiffness, combines with an increased in the wing span which increase the wing flexibility which may decrease the wing divergence and flutter speeds.Assume that we have a finite element model for a structure where the total nodes are divided into constrained nodes c and free nodes f.Applying the constrained condition on the structure, the finite element equation will take the form,(36)Kffqf=FfThe free degrees of freedom can be divided into bending degrees of freedom, b, which are required for the divergence and flutter analysis, and in-plane degrees of freedom, p, which will be reduced:(37)[KbbKbpKpbKpp]×{qbqp}={FbFp}Splitting into two equations:(38)[Kbb]×{qb}+[Kbp]×{qp}={Fb}[Kpb]×{qb}+[Kpp]×{qp}={Fp}Solving qpfrom the second equation of (29) gives(39){qp}=[Kpp]-1({Fp}-[Kpb]×{qb})From Eqs.
