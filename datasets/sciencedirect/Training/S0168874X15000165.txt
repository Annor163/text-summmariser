@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work presents two 4-node, 12-DOF quadrilateral displacement-based finite elements for analysis of the Mindlin–Reissner plate. Derived from the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F, the deflection and rotation fields of the proposed elements satisfy a priori all related governing equations. The unknown coefficients are determined through the generalized conforming element method, a relaxed and rational conforming approach. The resulting elements perform like nonconforming elements on a coarse mesh, and with mesh refinement they converge as conforming elements. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the new elements are insensitive to mesh distortion and free of shear locking, and can provide satisfactory results for most cases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As a major class of finite element models, Mindlin–Reissner plate bending elements have been extensively studied over the past few decades and numerous successful models were proposed [1–15]. Playing a central role in practical engineering analysis, the Mindlin–Reissner plate element is continuously being improved for better performance and to meet specific requirement. Among others, some of the latest developments include the NIPE formulations derived from the assumed-strain technique [16], the models with continuous displacement and discontinuous rotations [17,18], the element based on the high-order linked interpolation [19], the alternative alpha finite element method with discrete shear gap technique [20], and so on. However, two major challenges remain outstanding: (1) the performance of the element cannot be guaranteed when the mesh is severely distorted; and (2) the precisions for stress/resultant results are relatively lower than those for displacements.A series of new developments have been reported recently, which make it possible to address the aforementioned challenges. Liu et al. [21] proposed the smoothed FEM (SFEM), which integrates the strain smoothing technique into the conventional FEM and formulates different smoothed FEM models, including the cell-based SFEM [22,23], the edge-based SFEM [24] and the node-based SFEM [25]. The plate elements based on these SFEM models [26,27] are insensitive to mesh distortion and free of shear locking. Ribatić et al. [28] constructed two 9-node distortion-immune displacement-based quadrilateral thick plate elements by using bubble parameters. Cen et al. [29] proposed a hybrid displacement function (HDF) method for formulating Mindlin–Reissner plate elements, where they took the displacement function F[30] to derive the stress trial functions that satisfy all governing equations and employed the Timoshenko’s beam formulae to determine boundary displacement modes. The HDF element enables superior precision for both displacements and resultants, even in cases where a severely distorted mesh containing concave quadrilateral or degenerated triangular elements is used.By combining the displacement function F[29,30] with the generalized conforming element method [1], this work develops two high-performance displacement-based Mindlin–Reissner plate elements. The concept of the generalized conforming element was first proposed by Long et al. [31], and since then has been successfully applied to plane problems [32,33], plate problems [34–37] and shell problems [38] as well. In this concept, the displacement fields are usually determined by the relaxed compatibility requirements, i.e., the generalized conforming conditions.The new generalized conforming elements are derived via three steps. First, the deflection and rotation fields within the element are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F, and the corresponding unknown coefficients are introduced. Next, the relations between these unknown coefficients and the element’s nodal displacement DOFs are determined by employing a set of generalized compatibility conditions, from which the deflection and rotation fields can be expressed as functions of the element’s nodal displacement DOFs. Finally, the new elements can be constructed following the principle of minimum potential energy. These two quadrilateral elements are denoted as GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α, respectively, indicating that they are “Generalized Conforming Plate element with 4 nodes and 12 or 14 displacement coefficients”. Since the displacement components derived from the displacement function F can satisfy all related governing equations, these new elements also possess the advantages from analytical methods, as the HDF elements [29] do.The performance of the new elements is assessed with standard benchmark examples. Numerical results show that these two new elements are free of shear locking, insensitive to mesh distortions, and can provide satisfactory results for most cases. Only a small deviation exists for thick plates under soft simply supported boundary conditions due to interelement incompatibility.For a Mindlin–Reissner plate (seeFig. 1), the transverse deflection w and the rotations ψx, ψycan be expressed by the displacement function F[30]:(1)w=F−DC∇2F,ψx=∂F∂x,ψy=∂F∂y,in which F should satisfy the equation:(2)D∇2∇2F=q.Substitution of Eq. (1) into the strain–displacement relations yields(3)κxx=−∂2F∂x2,κyy=−∂2F∂y2,κxy=−2∂2F∂x∂y,(4)γxz=−DC∂∂x(∇2F),γyz=−DC∂∂y(∇2F),where D and C denote the bending and shear stiffness of the plate.The solutions of the deflection, rotations and strains can be readily derived from the fundamental analytical solutions of displacement function F[29]. For the general (homogeneous) part of F, the displacement components and strains are listed inTable 1. For the particular part corresponding to a plate subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse load q, the displacement components are(5)u⁎={w⁎ψx⁎ψy⁎}={q48D(x4+y4)−q4C(x2+y2)q12Dx3q12Dy3},and the strains are(6)E⁎={κxx⁎κyy⁎κxy⁎γxz⁎γyz⁎}={−q4Dx2−q4Dy20−q2Cx−q2Cy}.Unlike the traditional generalized conforming elements or nonconforming elements, the deflection and rotation fields of the new elements are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F. For a generalized conforming 4-node quadrilateral element, as shown inFig. 2, the displacement function F is set as the linear combination of its fundamental analytical solutions:(7)F=F0+F⁎=∑i=1kFi0αi+F⁎,where k is the number of the fundamental analytical solutions for the general part of F0, and αi(i=1−k) are the corresponding unknown coefficients. Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (1), the deflection and rotation fields within the element are obtained as(8)w=∑i=1kwi0αi+w⁎,ψx=∑i=1kψxi0αi+ψx⁎,ψy=∑i=1kψyi0αi+ψy⁎.The displacements can be expressed in the following matrix form:(9)u=[w10w20w30⋯wk0ψx10ψx20ψx30⋯ψxk0ψy10ψy20ψy30⋯ψyk0]{α1α2α3⋮αk}+{w⁎ψx⁎ψy⁎}=Uα+u⁎.Then, the corresponding strain field can be obtained as(10)E=[κxx1κxx2κxx3⋯κxxkκyy1κyy2κyy3⋯κyykκxy1κxy2κxy3⋯κxykγxz1γxz2γxz3⋯γxzkγyz1γyz2γyz3⋯γyzk]{α1α2α3⋮αk}+{κxx⁎κyy⁎κxy⁎γxz⁎γyz⁎}=E¯α+E⁎.The detailed components of matrices U andE¯in the above equations are listed in Table 1.In order to solve these unknown coefficients αi(i=1−k), it is necessary to introduce k generalized conforming conditions. After employing an appropriate set of generalized conforming conditions, the relations between the coefficients αi(i=1−k) and the element’s nodal displacement DOFs are obtained as(11)λα+U⁎=Γqe,where(12)qe=[w1ψx1ψy1w2ψx2ψy2w3ψx3ψy3w4ψx4ψy4]T.The matrices λ, U⁎ and Γ have different expressions for different sets of generalized conforming conditions. The details for this matter will be discussed in Section 2.3.Following Eq. (11), α can be expressed in terms of qe:(13)α=Lλqe−Lu,where(14)Lλ=λ−1Γ,Lu=λ−1U⁎.Then, substitution of Eq. (13) into Eqs. (9) and (10) yields(15)u=U(Lλqe−Lu)+u⁎=Nqe+N⁎,(16)E=E¯(Lλqe−Lu)+E⁎=Bqe+B⁎,in which(17)N=ULλ,N⁎=u⁎−ULu,(18)B=E¯Lλ,B⁎=E⁎−E¯Lu.The potential energy functional of a Mindlin–Reissner plate element can be expressed in the following matrix form [1]:(19)ΠPe=∬Ae12ETAEdxdy−∬AefTudxdy+∫SσeR¯Td¯ds,where A is the elasticity matrix as defined in Eq. (20), f is the distributed transverse load vector within the plate as defined in Eq. (21),R¯is the boundary load vector at the element’s edge as defined in Eq. (22), andd¯is the boundary displacement along the boundarySσeas defined in Eq. (23).(20)A=[DμD000μDD000001−μ2D00000C00000C],(21)f=[q00]T,(22)R¯=[−T¯M¯nM¯ns]T,(23)d¯={w¯ψ¯nψ¯s}|Sσe=[1lm−ml]{w¯ψ¯xψ¯y}|Sσe=Lu|Sσe,where l, m denote the direction cosines of the element boundaries’ outer normal n.By substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (19) and applying the principle of minimum potential energy,(24)∂ΠPe∂qe=∬AeBTABdxdyqe+∬AeBTAB⁎dxdy−∬AeNTfdxdy+∫SσeN|SσeTLTR¯ds=0,the following relation can be obtained:(25)Kqe=pe,where K is the element stiffness matrix(26)K=∬AeBTABdxdy,and peis the element nodal equivalent load vector(27)pe=∬AeNTfdxdy−∬AeBTAB⁎dxdy−∫SσeN|SσeTLTR¯ds,whereN|Sσeis the value of N along the boundarySσe.The unknown coefficient α can be derived from Eq. (13) after solving for qe. Then the displacements and the strains at any point of the element can be determined by substituting its Cartesian coordinates into Eqs. (9) and (10).The above derivation shows the general formulations for constructing new generalized conforming elements. If different generalized conforming conditions are employed for deriving the elements, the detailed expressions of related matrices (see from Eqs. (14)–(18)) will also be different.In this section, two new generalized conforming plate (GCP) elements are constructed following the procedure described in Section 2.2. According to the number of the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F being used, these two elements are denoted by GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α, respectively.As shown in Fig. 2, for the element GCP4-12α, the displacement function F (see Eq. (7)) is assumed to be the linear combination of its first 12 terms of fundamental analytical solutions (see Table 1). Then, k in Eqs. (7–10) equals 12. To determine these coefficients αi(i=1–12), 12 generalized conforming conditions must be employed.First, the following nodal compatibility conditions for deflection are considered:(28)w(xj,yj)=wj,(j=1−4),where (xj, yj), (j=1–4), are the Cartesian coordinates of the node j, w(xj, yj) is calculated by using Eq. (9), and as one of the element’s DOFs, wjis the deflection at the node j.Next, the point compatibility conditions are considered for normal rotations at two Gauss points Aiand Bi(the local parametric coordinates are±1/3, respectively) along each edge:(29)ψn(xk,yk)=ψ¯nk,(k=A1,B1,A2,B2,A3,B3,A4,B4),where ψn(xk, yk) are also calculated by substituting the Cartesian coordinates into Eq. (9), andψ¯nkare determined by the boundary normal rotationsψ¯nvarying linearly along the edge ij:(30)ψ¯nij=(1−s)ψ¯ni+sψ¯nj,(s=0−1).whereψ¯niandψ¯njare the normal rotations at the node i, j along the edge ij.Substituting Eqs. (7–10) into Eqs. (28–30), the matrices in Eq. (11) can be obtained for the element GCP4-12α. Specifically, the matrix λ can be written as:(31)λ=[Wφn],φn=TnΦ,in which(32)W=[w10(x1,y1)w20(x1,y1)w30(x1,y1)⋯w120(x1,y1)w10(x2,y2)w20(x2,y2)w30(x2,y2)⋯w120(x2,y2)w10(x3,y3)w20(x3,y3)w30(x3,y3)⋯w120(x3,y3)w10(x4,y4)w20(x4,y4)w30(x4,y4)⋯w120(x4,y4)],(33)Φ=[ψx10(xA1,yA1)ψx20(xA1,yA1)⋯ψx120(xA1,yA1)ψy10(xA1,yA1)ψy20(xA1,yA1)⋯ψy120(xA1,yA1)⋮⋮⋱⋮ψx10(xB4,yB4)ψx20(xB4,yB4)⋯ψx120(xB4,yB4)ψy10(xB4,yB4)ψy20(xB4,yB4)⋯ψy120(xB4,yB4)],(34)Tn=[T1T2T3T4],Ti=[lijmijlijmij],wherei=1,2,3,4→,j=2,3,4,1→, and lijand mijdenote the direction cosines of the outer normal of the element edge ij.The matrix U⁎ can be written as(35)U⁎=[W⁎φn⁎],φn⁎=TnΦ⁎,(36)W⁎=[w⁎(x1,y1)w⁎(x2,y2)w⁎(x3,y3)w⁎(x4,y4)],(37)Φ⁎=[ψx⁎(xA1,yA1)ψy⁎(xA1,yA1)⋮ψx⁎(xB4,yB4)ψy⁎(xB4,yB4)].The matrix Γ is given by(38)Γ=[ΓwΓφ],(39)Γw=[I1×3I1×3I1×3I1×3],I1×3=[100],(40)Γφ=[0−1l12(1−sA1)y121l12(1−sA1)x120−1l12sA1y121l12sA1x120000000−1l12(1−sB1)y121l12(1−sB1)x120−1l12sB1y121l12sB1x120000000000−1l23(1−sA2)y231l23(1−sA2)x230−1l23sA2y231l23sA2x230000000−1l23(1−sB2)y231l23(1−sB2)x230−1l23sB2y231l23sB2x230000000000−1l34(1−sA3)y341l34(1−sA3)x340−1l34sA3y341l34sA3x340000000−1l34(1−sB3)y341l34(1−sB3)x340−1l34sB3y341l34sB3x340−1l41sA4y411l41sA4x410000000−1l41(1−sA4)y411l41(1−sA4)x410−1l41sB4y411l41sB4x410000000−1l41(1−sA4)y411l41(1−sA4)x41],wherexij=xi−xj,yij=yi−yj, and lijis the length of edge ij.Then, by substituting the matrices λ, U⁎ and Γ (see Eqs. (31–40)) into the equations discussed in Section 2.2, the expressions of the stiffness matrix and the nodal equivalent load vector for the element GCP4-12α can be obtained.For the element GCP4-14α (see Fig. 2), the displacement function F is formed by the first 14 terms of its fundamental analytical solutions (see Table 1).To determine the unknown coefficients αi(i=1–14), fourteen generalized conforming conditions are needed. Besides those conditions used for the element GCP4-12α, two additional compatibility conditions are considered:(41)w(x5,y5)+w(x7,y7)=w5+w7w(x6,y6)+w(x8,y8)=w6+w8,where (xj, yj) (j=5–8) are the Cartesian coordinates of the mid-side points 5–8 at each element edge, and wj(j=5−8) are the deflections at these mid-side points. The deflections wj(j=5–8) are determined by using the locking-free formulae of Timoshenko’s beam [29]:(42)w¯ij=[1−s+(1−2δij)Z3]wi+[s−(1−2δij)Z3]wj+lij2[Z2+(1−2δij)Z3]ψsi−lij2[Z2−(1−2δij)Z3]ψsj,in which(43)Z2=s(1−s),Z3=s(1−s)(1−2s),δij=6λij1+12λij,λij=DClij2,where D and C denote the bending and shear stiffness, respectively; and lijis the edge length. For these mid-side points 5–8, s equals 1/2.Then, by substituting Eqs. (7–10) into these fourteen generalized conforming conditions (see Eqs. (28)–(30) and (41)–(43)), the details of matrices in Eq. (11) can be obtained. Specifically, the matrix λ is given by(44)λ=[WφnWmid],where W and φnshare the same for as in Eq. (31), and Wmidis obtained as(45)Wmid=[w10(x5,y5)+w10(x7,y7)w20(x5,y5)+w20(x7,y7)⋯w140(x5,y5)+w140(x7,y7)w10(x6,y6)+w10(x8,y8)w20(x6,y6)+w20(x8,y8)⋯w140(x6,y6)+w140(x8,y8)].The matrix U⁎ is(46)U⁎=[W⁎φn⁎Wmid⁎],where W⁎ andφn⁎are the same as Eq. (35), andWmid⁎is obtained as:(47)Wmid⁎=[w⁎(x5,y5)+w⁎(x7,y7)w⁎(x6,y6)+w⁎(x8,y8)].The matrix Γ is(48)Γ=[ΓwΓφΓw⁎],where Γwand Γφare the same as Eq. (38), andΓw⁎is obtained as(49)Γw⁎=[12−18x12−18y121218x1218y1212−18x34−18y341218x3418y341218x4118y4112−18x23−18y231218x2318y2312−18x41−18y41],wherexij=xi−xj,yij=yi−yj.Thus, the stiffness matrix and the nodal equivalent load vector for the element GCP4-14α can be readily obtained. Since the element GCP4-14α uses 14 terms of fundamental analytical solutions, which guarantees the completeness of the displacement function up to the fourth order, it performs better than the element GCP4-12α in distorted meshes.Several benchmark examples are employed to assess the new elements GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α. In order to clearly illustrate the performance, the results from some well-known Mindlin–Reissner plate elements are also provided for comparison, including MITC4 [2,27], Q4BL [10], ARS-Q12 [14], RDKMQ [15], MISC2 [27], AC-MQ4 [37], S4R [39], CRB1 [40], CRB2 [40], S1 [40], DKQ [41], 9βQ4 [42], MiSP4 [43], MMiSP4 [43], MiSP4+ [44] and DKMQ [45].The model and the mesh used for the patch test are shown inFig. 3a together with the parameter settings. Three cases with different span–thickness ratios (2a/h=1000, 100, 20) are considered, where 2a is the length of the longer edge and h is the plate’s thickness.(a)Displacement loading caseIn this case, the deflections and rotations at the outer nodes 1–4 are applied to the patch as the boundary conditions, and their values at the inner nodes 5–8 will be evaluated.For the constant bending state, the exact displacement fields are given by [28](50)w=(1+x+2y+x2+y2)2,ψx=(1+2x)2,ψy=(2+2y)2.Both GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α can provide exact solutions in all span–thickness ratio cases (2a/h=1000, 100, 20).For the constant twisting state, the exact displacement fields are given by [28](51)w=(1+x+2y+xy)2,ψx=(1+y)2,ψy=(2+x)2.In case 2a/h=1000, both new elements can pass the test exactly. In case 2a/h=100, the maximum relative percentage errors of elements GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α are 0.078% and 0.074%, respectively, and increase to 1.73% and 2.05% in case 2a/h=20. These errors are mainly caused by the interelement incompatibilities in a coarse mesh. With the refinement of the mesh, these errors will vanish rapidly.For the constant shear deformation state, the exact displacement fields are [46](52)w=(x+y)2,ψx=−12,ψy=−12.This test is significant only for the thick plate with a very large thickness in which only shear energy works. The element GCP4-14α can exactly pass this test, while the maximum relative percentage error of GCP4-12α is 6.0%.Constant bending moment loading case (Mn=1)Fig. 3b shows this loading case in which the plate is subjected to moments along its all edges. The equivalent nodal forces are also given in Fig. 3b. In this case, the bending moments Mx=1 and My=1, while other resultants are equal to zero. For all different span–thickness ratios (2a/h=1000, 100, 20), both GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α can exactly pass this patch test.Constant twisting moment loading case (Mxy=1)As shown in Fig. 3c, the plate is subjected to twisting moment along its all edges. The equivalent nodal forces, derived from the assumption that the plate’s edge behaves like a locking-free Timoshenko’s beam [29], are also given in Fig. 3c. In this case, the twisting moments Mxy=1, while other resultants are equal to zero. When 2a/h=1000, both two new elements can pass the test exactly. For the ratio 2a/h=100, the maximum relative percentage errors of the elements GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α are 2.12% and 1.70%, respectively. And for the ratio 2a/h=20, they increase to 3.24% and 2.80%.Constant shear resultant loading case (Tx=1)As stated in Section 3.1(a), this test is significant only for the thick plate limit [45]. Fig. 3d shows the cantilever plate, with a very large value of thickness h, is subjected to a distributed line shear force at the free edge (replaced by two concentrated nodal forces). The value of shear force Txshould equal 1. The element GCP4-14α can exactly pass this test, while the maximum relative percentage error of GCP4-12α is 2.62%.Some discussionsFrom above tests, it can be observed that, for the thin plate (2a/h=1000), both new elements can provide exact solutions. However, small errors may appear when the thickness increases for constant twisting moment cases. These errors are mainly caused by the interelement incompatibilities, and can be eliminated by using a refiner mesh. Since the element GCP4-14α employs two more trial functions, it indeed exhibits better performance. As described in previous sections, these two elements belong to the nonconforming model in a coarse mesh, and will converge into conforming models when the mesh is refined. Thus, the convergence can still be guaranteed.The square plate is subjected to a uniformly distributed load, as shown inFig. 4. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled. The edge length and thickness are denoted by L and h, respectively. Poisson’s ratio μ is set as 0.3. Three cases with different boundary conditions are considered: the clamped case (w=0, ψn=0, ψs=0), the soft simply supported (SS1) case (w=0), and the hard simply supported (SS2) case (w=0, ψs=0).Tables 2–7 give the dimensionless central deflections and moments of the plate for two ratios (h/L=0.001, 0.1), which are calculated by using the regular mesh (see Fig. 4a). For comparison, results obtained by some other quadrilateral elements [2,10,14,27,37] are also presented. To visually show the convergences, the corresponding plots using log scale are given inFigs. 5–7. Furthermore, the results calculated by using the distorted meshes (see Fig. 4b) are also plotted inFig. 8. In these figures, the relative errors are defined as follows:(53)ew=|w−wref||wref|,eM=|M−Mref||Mref|.Note, because the number of the significant digits for the reference solutions is only four, the low bound of the relative error is about 10−5.It can be seen that, in most cases, these two elements can provide good results, especially for thin plate cases. But for the SS1 thick plate case, they may converge to a slightly stiffer solution. This problem is mainly caused by the interelement incompatibility. Since the errors are only 1%, the results are still in an acceptable range for engineering applications. An interesting feature is that the results obtained by these two new elements are entirely in agreement with each other in the regular meshes.Fig. 9 shows a clamped thin square plate (h/L=0.001) subjected to a uniformly distributed load. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled by a coarse mesh (2×2). Two distortion cases are considered: the symmetric case and the asymmetric case. In the symmetric case, the central mesh node is moved along the main diagonal of the plate to the corner node. In the asymmetric case, the central mesh node is moved to a plate edge along the direction parallel to another plate edge.The normalized results obtained by the new elements and some other elements [2,27,39–41] are plotted inFig. 10. The results show that the proposed elements are quite insensitive to the mesh distortion, and the element GCP4-14α performs more stably. It should be noted that, in the symmetric case, when the absolute value of the distortion parameter Δ reaches or exceeds 1.25, one element will degenerate into a triangle or a concave quadrangle. Under these situations, the new elements can still perform well, while most other elements fail to provide a solution.As shown inFig. 11, a clamed cantilever plate [42], which is subjected to a tip load P=0.5, is modeled by two elements. The material parameters are E=10.92 and μ=0.3. The thickness and width are h=0.01 and L=1, respectively. The mesh distortion is measured by the parameter Δ.Fig. 12 shows the percentage deviations of the transverse tip displacement at node C obtained by different elements [14,40,42]. This test proves again that the two new elements are more insensitive to the mesh distortion than others.These two tests sufficiently show the robustness of the new elements in distorted meshes. It can also be found that the element GCP4-14α exhibits a more outstanding performance, since its trial functions are derived from the displacement function with up to the fourth order completeness.The Razzaque 60° skew plate [47] (h/L=0.001) is subjected to a uniformly distributed load, as shown inFig. 13. The transverse deflection w and the bending moment Myat the central node C are calculated. Results obtained by the new elements and others [2,14,15,27,43–45] are plotted inFig. 14. The results show that the new elements can produce good results for both deflections and bending moments.The circular plate subjected to a uniformly distributed load q=1 is shown inFig. 15. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled. The geometrical parameters and material parameters are also given in Fig. 15. Two different thickness–radius ratio cases (h/R=0.02, 0.2) and two different boundary condition cases (the SSl BC case and the clamped BC case) are analyzed. The normalized center deflection and moments are listed inTables 8 and 9.Fig. 16 shows the distributions of bending moments Mr, Mθand shear force Tralong the radius of the clamped circular plate calculated by using 48 elements. It can be observed in Fig. 16 that the two new elements can provide resultants which are in good agreement with the exact solutions [43,44], while most conventional displacement-based models fail.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Two generalized conforming plate elements GCP4-12α and GCP4-14α, whose trial functions are derived from the analytical solutions of the displacement function [29,30,48], are proposed in this paper. The generalized conforming technique relaxes the requirements of compatibility while improving the element performances. Since the displacement and strain fields of the new elements are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F, which satisfy a priori all related governing equations, these new elements possess the advantages from analytical methods. Some benchmarks are employed to assess the performance of these new elements. In most cases, these two new elements can both provide rather good results, especially for thin plate cases. But for the thick plate under SS1 boundary condition, the result may converge to a slightly stiffer solution. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the interelement incompatibility. Since the error is only about 1%, those results are still in an acceptable range for engineering applications.
