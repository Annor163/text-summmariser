@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Numerical preference relations (NPRs) consisting of numerical judgments can be considered as a general form of the existing preference relations, such as multiplicative preference relations (MPRs), fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), interval MPRs (IV-MPRs) and interval FPRs (IV-FPRs). On the basis of NPRs, we develop a stochastic preference analysis (SPA) method to aid the decision makers (DMs) in decision making. The numerical judgments in NPRs can also be characterized by different probability distributions in accordance with practice. By exploring the judgment space of NPRs, SPA produces several outcomes including the rank acceptability index, the expected priority vector, the expected rank and the confidence factor. The outcomes are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation with at least 95% confidence degree. Based on the outcomes, the DMs can choose some of them which they find most useful to make reliable decisions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In decision making, preference relations are used to collect the preferences provided by decision makers (DMs). Then by prioritization methods, priorities can be obtained to rank the compared objectives in the preference relations. If input data in a preference relation are numerical values, then we can call it a numerical preference relation (NPR). NPRs have wide applications in multi-criteria decision making (Büyüközkan & Çifçi, 2011; Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 1998; Ho, Xu, & Dey, 2010; Saaty, 2008; Vaidya & Kumar, 2006; Zhu & Xu, 2014), where multiplicative preference relations (MPRs) (Saaty, 1980) and fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) (Orlovsky, 1978) are two basic ones.Based on a 1–9 scale, the DMs provide deterministic point estimates as judgments to represent their preferences over paired comparisons of objectives to construct MPRs. Based on a 0.1–0.9 scale, FPRs can be constructed in a similar way. When considering uncertainties, many other possible representations of judgments can be used according to practice, such as intervals and random variables. To analyze the representations of judgments in multi-criteria decision making methods, Hahn (2003) gave systematic investigations shown in Fig. 1. With respect to the typology in Fig. 1, Type A and Type B indicate that errors in judgments are assumed to be nonexistent. When judgments are made with some degrees of error, they can be represented by intervals as in Type C. In Type D, the judgments are considered as a realization of stochastic phenomena.With respect to NPRs, Types A and B correspond with FPRs and MPRs, respectively. Type C corresponds with interval MPRs (IV-MPRs) (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and interval FPRs (IV-FPRs) (Xu, 2004b). It is clear that MPRs and FPRs are two special cases of IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs respectively. If some judgment(s) in NPRs are indicated by stochastic variable(s), then the NPRs are with probability interpretations.The prioritization methods for NPRs in Types A, B and C are deterministic procedures, but Type D is with stochastic procedures. Hahn (2003) argued that the prioritization methods with deterministic procedures are special cases of their stochastic counterparts. So the stochastic methods represent a generalization of the deterministic ones. Many valuable prioritization methods with deterministic procedures have been developed, such as the classic eigenvector method (Saaty, 1977), the goal programming methods (Choo & Wedley, 2004; Fan, Ma, Jiang, Sun, & Ma, 2006; Xu, 2004a; Xu & Chen, 2008), the least deviation method (Xu & Da, 2005), the chi-square method (Wang, Fan, & Hua, 2007), the least-square method (Gong, 2008) and the fuzzy linear programming method (Zhu & Xu, 2014).For the prioritization methods using stochastic procedures associated with stochastic variables that indicate judgments in Type D, Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996), Rosenbloom (1997), Levary and Wan (1998, 1999), and Banuelas and Antony (2006) developed some simulation methods based on MPRs in analytical hierarchy process, where probability distributions are used to describe the judgments.From the discussion above, we find that the prioritization methods for NPRs depend on the representations of judgments. However, considering the common characteristic of NPRs that consist of numerical judgments, is there a general prioritization method? In this paper, we develop stochastic preference analysis (SPA) as a new prioritization method for NPRs from a stochastic point of view, where the NPRs can be with different representations of numerical judgments. The results produced by this method are with probability interpretations. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic concepts, then develops the concept of NPRs. In Section 3, we develop SPA. Section 4 gives two numerical examples. Section 5 provides a necessary discussion. The paper ends with some conclusions in Section 6.In this section, we introduce the basic forms of numerical preference relations (NPRs), that are multiplicative preference relations (MPRs) and fuzzy preference relations (FPRs). Some consistency measures are also introduced, which are used to develop stochastic preference analysis (SPA) in the next section.For a set of objectives X={x1,x2,…,xn}, the definition of MPRs can be stated as follows.Definition 1Saaty, 1980A MPR on X is represented by A∊X×X, A=(aij)n×n, where aijindicates the degree that xiis preferred to xj, aij∊{1/9,1/8,…,1/2,1,2,…,9}, and aijaji=1.In A=(aij)n×n, aij=1 indicates indifference between xiand xj; aij>1 indicates that xiis preferred to xj; aij<1 indicates that xjis preferred to xi.Saaty (1980) defined the consistency on A as perfect if(1)aij=ωiωj,∀i,j=1,2,…,nwhere ω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn) is the priority vector of A, satisfying∑i=1nωi=1, ωi>0, i=1,2,…,n.Definition 2Orlovsky, 1978A FPR on X is represented by R∊X×X, R=(rij)n×nis characterized by a membership function, μR:X×X→[0,1], where rij=μR(xi,xj) is interpreted as the preference degree or the intensity of the xiover xj, and rij+rji=1.In R=(rij)n×n, rij=0.5 indicates indifference between xiand xj(xi∼xj); rij=1 indicates that xiis absolutely preferred to xj; rij>0.5 indicates that xiis preferred to xj(xi≻xj).Tanino (1984) defined that R is multiplicative consistent if(2)rij=ωiωi+ωj,∀i,j=1,2,…,nor R is additive consistent if(3)rij=0.5(ωi-ωj+1),∀i,j=1,2,…,nwhere ω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn) is the priority vector of R, satisfying∑i=1nωi=1, ωi>0, i=1,2,…,n.Based on the definitions of MPRs and FPRs, interval MPRs (IV-MPRs) developed by Saaty and Vargas (1987), and interval FPRs (IV-FPRs) developed by Xu and Chen (2008) can be restated respectively as follows.Definition 3An IV-MPR can be represented byA∼=(ãij)n×n, whereãij=[aijL,aijU],aijL=1/ajiUandaijU=1/ajiLfor all i,j=1,2,…,n.An IV-FPR can be represented byR∼=(r̃ij)n×n, wherer̃ij=[r̃ijL,r̃ijU],r̃ijL=1-r̃jiUandr̃ijU=1-r̃jiLfor all i,j=1,2,…,n.Using numerical values to represent judgments, NPRs encompass MPRs, FPRs, IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs as special cases. We give a definition as follows.Definition 5A NPR on X is represented by Z∊X×X, Z=(zij)n×n, where zijindicates the degree(s) that xiis preferred to xjin the form of numerical value(s), such as a single numerical value, an interval numerical value, or several possible numerical values.Generally, for one NPR, the numerical values should be given based on the same scale, such as the 1–9 scale associated with MPRs or the 0.1–0.9 scale associated with FPRs. So NPRs can be MPRs, FPRs, IV-MPRs or IV-FPRs etc., which are also the preference relations we take into account in this paper. Moreover, hesitant fuzzy preference relations (Zhu & Xu, 2013) and hesitant multiplicative preference relations (Xia & Xu, 2013) are also special cases of NPRs.SPA is a decision support method to aid the decision makers (DMs) to make informed decisions. It is motivated by a stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) method, originally introduced by Lahdelma, Hokkanen, & Salminen, 1998. SMAA is a family of methods for supporting multi-criteria decision making problems, including SMAA-2 (Lahdelma & Salminen, 2001), SMAA-O (Lahdelma, Miettinen, & Salminen, 2003), etc. SPA is developed by analyzing the judgment space of NPRs. It is carried out by Monte Carlo simulation which can guarantee reliable results for a large enough number of iterations. By a step by step procedure, SPA provides constructive suggestions for the DMs.Since MPRs and FPRs are special cases of IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs respectively when uncertainties among the judgments tend to zero, we set a NPR asZ∼=(z̃ij)n×nwith respect to a set of objectives {x1,x2,…,xn}, wherez̃ij=[zijL,zijU]. SoZ∼can be an IV-MPR or an IV-FPR. The probabilities distributions of the values inz̃ijcan be discrete or continuous. As usual, the values in IV-MPRs and IV-FPRs are assumed to be uniformly distributed in existing works. According to practice, more possible probability distributions can be chosen.Following the probability distributions of the values inz̃ij, let ζijbe the stochastic variables satisfyingζij∈z̃ij, i,j=1,2,…,n, we get a set of stochastic variables ζ={ζij:i,j=1,2,…,n; i<j} which represent the judgments of xiover xj. To begin with SPA, it is required to derive priorities from ζ by a prioritization method associated with MPRs or FPRs. For example, as mentioned in Introduction, we can refer to the classic eigenvector method, the goal programming methods, the least deviation method, the chi-square method, the least-square method and the fuzzy linear programming method.Among these prioritization methods, the goal programming methods are convenient to be used in practice, which can directly produce results by solving mathematic models based on consistency measures (Aull-Hyde, Erdogan, & Duke, 2006; Grošelj & Stirn, 2012; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012; Tanino, 1984, 1988; Xu, Driessen, Sun, & Su, 2012). Therefore, we develop a general goal programming model in this paper, that is to calculate consistency discrepancy based on one of the consistency measures shown in Eqs. (1)–(3).For ζ, letω(ζ)=(ω1(ζ),ω2(ζ),…,ωn(ζ))be the corresponding priority vector. IfZ∼is an IV-MPR, then following Eq. (1), the average consistency discrepancy of ζ, denoted by Dc(ζ,ω(ζ)), can be computed as follows:(4)Dc(ζ,ω(ζ))=n(n-1)2∑i<j|ωi(ζ)-ωj(ζ)ζij|.Further minimising Dc(ζ,ω(ζ)), we can get ω(ζ) by solving a goal programming problem:(5)minDc(ζ,ω(ζ))s.t.ωi(ζ)⩾0,i=1,2,…,n,∑i=1nωi(ζ)=1.The distributions of ζij(i,j=1,2,…,n) can be characterized by a density function f(ζij). We assume that the stochastic variables are independent, so the joint probability distribution of ζijis specified by a density function as(6)f(ζ)=∏i<jfij(ζij).In a three-objectives case,Z∼=(ζij)3×3is a convex polyhedron space which can be specially shown in Fig. 2.Based on the obtained ω(ζ), a ranking function, which makes xirank r, is defined as follows:(7)ranki(ω(ζ))=1+∑k=1nρ(ωk(ζ)>ωi(ζ))=r(i=1,2,…,n)where ρ(true)=1 and ρ(false)=0. This function defines a ranking judgment spaceZir(ζ), which can be specially shown in Fig. 2, defined as(8)Zir(ζ)={ζ∈Z∼:ranki(ω(ζ))=1+∑k=1nρ(ωk(ζ)>ωi(ζ))=r}.To measure the acceptable probabilities of judgments that make xirank r, we define a rank acceptability indexbir. It is the share of the ranking judgment space to the overall judgment space, which is conveniently expressed by a percentage. The definition is a multidimensional integral defined as follows:(9)bir=∫Zir(ζ)f(ζ)dζwherebir∈[0,1],∑r=1nbir=1. The biggerbir, the higher acceptable probabilities of xiranking r.According to the priority vector ω(ζ) and the density function, we can also define an expected priority vector:(10)E(ω(ζ))=∫Z∼f(ζ)ω(ζ)dζ.Then, the rank of xiindicated by E(ω(ζ)), called an expected rank, can be computed as(11)rie=1+∑k=1nρ(E(ω(ζ))k>E(ω(ζ))i).Furthermore, the confidence factor, which is used to describe the confidence degree of the expected rank, is defined as the probability that the objective receives the expected rank:(12)pie=∫Z∼:ranki(ω(ζ))=rief(ζ)dζ.For a decision making problem with NPRs, the step by step procedure of SPA is given as below to aid the DMs.Step 1. Define the problem in terms of the objectives for comparison.Step 2. Collect numerical judgments from the DMs to construct NPRs, and then determine probability distributions of the judgments.Step 3. Calculate the outcomes of SPA, that arebir, E(ω(ζ)),rieandpie.Step 4. Present the results in Step 3 to the DMs, and explain them. So the DMs can choose the outcome(s) that they find useful to assist them to make decisions.NPRs can be IV-MPRs or IV-FPRs, the judgments in NPRs can be discrete or continuous. For illustration, we now give two examples with respect to an IV-FPR, where the judgments are continuous, and an IV-MPR, where the judgments are discrete.Example 1Considering a decision making problem involving five alternatives {x1,x2,…,x5} for comparison, we assume a set of expected values, denoted byIt is helpful to graphically examine the rank acceptability indices which indicate the acceptable probabilities of the alternatives for each rank by a three dimensional column chart shown in Fig. 3. If the expected ranks of the alternatives receive relative high confidence degrees, the expected ranks should be reliable. Particularly, x5 is the best alternative with 100% confidence degree in this example.Example 2We now consider a discrete-distribution case of the judgments in an IV-MPRA∼1taken from Saaty and Vargas (1987):The judgments inA∼1are assumed to be the integers or reciprocals of the integers between the two bounds of each interval following the uniform distribution. For example, there are seven components in the interval [1/3,5] as 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, where these values are with the same probability 1/7. Let Eq. (1) be the consistency measure, the outcomes of SPA are shown in Table 2.By a three dimensional column chart, the rank acceptable probabilities of the five alternatives for each rank are depicted in Fig. 4.With respect to the rank acceptability indices, it is clear that x1 receives high acceptable probability of ranking the first; but x2 and x3 receive approximate acceptable probabilities for the ranks 2 and 3; x4 and x5 receive approximate acceptable probabilities for the ranks 4 and 5. So x2 and x3 compete for the ranks of two and three, and x4 and x5 compete for the ranks of four and five. According to the expected ranks and the confidence factors, we can also find that the expected rank of x1 with the confidence degree 98.38% can be considered as reliable. But other alternatives receive relative low confidence degrees for the expected ranks.The outcomes in Table 2 are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. To better understand this simulation process, we depict 10,000 simulation results of priorities and mark the expected priorities shown in Fig. 5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have defined a concept of numerical preference relations (NPRs) which encompass all the existing preference relations consisting of numerical judgments as special cases, then have developed stochastic preference analysis (SPA) as a new prioritization method to deal with NPRs. The values of numerical judgments in NPRs can be characterized by different probability distributions according to actual situations, such as discrete, continuous, uniform and normal distributions. By exploring the judgment space of NPRs, SPA produces several outcomes, including the rank acceptable index, the expected priority vector, the expected rank and the confidence factor, to aid the decision makers to make better decisions. Particularly, by a visible three dimensional column chart, all the acceptable probabilities of the objectives in NPRs for each rank can be clearly described. And the competitive objectives that share some similar ranks with approximate acceptable probabilities can also be clearly identified. The further research for SPA can concentrate on the analysis of the outcomes to produce new valuable results.
