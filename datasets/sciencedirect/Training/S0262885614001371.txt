@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The rotation, scaling and translation invariant property of image moments has a high significance in image recognition. Legendre moments as a classical orthogonal moment have been widely used in image analysis and recognition. Since Legendre moments are defined in Cartesian coordinate, the rotation invariance is difficult to achieve. In this paper, we first derive two types of transformed Legendre polynomial: substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials. Based on these two types of polynomials, two radial orthogonal moments, named substituted radial shifted Legendre moments and weighted radial shifted Legendre moments (SRSLMs and WRSLMs) are proposed. The proposed moments are orthogonal in polar coordinate domain and can be thought as generalized and orthogonalized complex moments. They have better image reconstruction performance, lower information redundancy and higher noise robustness than the existing radial orthogonal moments. At last, a mathematical framework for obtaining the rotation, scaling and translation invariants of these two types of radial shifted Legendre moments is provided. Theoretical and experimental results show the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of image reconstruction capability and invariant recognition accuracy under both noisy and noise-free conditions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Moments and moment invariants due to their ability to represent global features have become one of the most important and frequently used methods in image analysis [1–3], pattern recognition [4], image watermarking [5], edge detection [6], template matching [7] and so on. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the moment methods can be divided into non-orthogonal moments and orthogonal moments. Non-orthogonal moments such as geometric moments, complex moments and rotational moments have a certain degree of information redundancy and high sensitivity to noise, and the reconstruction of image from these moments is also quite difficult [8,9]. Orthogonal moments that are constructed in terms of orthogonal polynomials have received a wide range of attention in recent years since they have the properties of image reconstruction, low information redundancy and high robustness to noise. Depending on the kernel polynomials orthogonal on a rectangle or on a disk, orthogonal moments can be further divided into orthogonal moments defined in polar coordinate or Cartesian coordinate. The orthogonal moments defined in polar coordinate mainly include Zernike moments [10,23], orthogonal Fourier–Mellin moments [22], pseudo-Zernike moments [11], Bessel–Fourier moments [27], and the remarkable advantage of these moments is easily to achieve rotation invariance. The orthogonal moments defined in the Cartesian coordinate mainly include Legendre [10], Tchebichef [2], Krawtchouk [12] and Hahn moments [1]. For those moments, the translation and scale invariance can be directly derived but the rotation invariance is hardly achieved.Legendre moments as classical orthogonal moments defined in the Cartesian coordinate have been widely used in the field of image analysis. Refs. [13–15] discussed the computational aspects of the Legendre moments for both binary and gray level images. Chong et al. [16] studied the translation and scale invariant of the Legendre moments. Recently, Zhang et al. [17] used the Legendre moments for blurred image recognition, and then the same group of authors [5] proposed an image watermark detection and extraction method based on the Legendre moments.It is known that the rotation, scaling and translation invariant property of image moments has a high significance in image recognition. Although the translation and scaling invariant of the Legendre moments have been studied in [16], unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, both rotation, scaling and translation invariant of the Legendre moments have not been studied until now. In this paper, we first introduce two types of radial orthogonal polynomials, named substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials. They are the transformed versions of classical Legendre polynomials and orthogonal on a disk. On this basis, two types of radial orthogonal moments are proposed. The proposed orthogonal moments are defined in polar coordinate and can be expressed as a linear combination of complex moments. They are easy for image reconstruction and have high noise robustness. At last, we also give a framework to derive those two radial orthogonal moment invariants for translation, scaling and rotation invariant image recognition.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the derivations of shifted Legendre polynomials, substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials are presented. Section 3 introduces the definition of substituted and weighted Radial shifted Legendre moments (SRSLMs and WRSLMs). Section 4 discusses the properties and computational aspects of these two radial orthogonal moments. The framework of obtaining rotation, scaling and translation invariance of SRSLMs and WRSLMs is provided in Section 5. Section 6 gives the comparative analysis of the proposed approach with orthogonal Fourier–Mellin moments (OFMs), Zernike moments (ZMs), pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs), Legendre moments (LMs) and complex moments (CMs) in terms of the image reconstruction capability, invariant image recognition accuracy and computational cost. Section 7 concludes this paper.The well-known Legendre differential equation is [29](1)1−x2Pn′x′+nn+1Pnx=0,−1≤x≤1The shifted Legendre polynomialsP^nrare solutions of the shifted Legendre differential equation, which is obtained directly from Legendre differential equation by lettingP^nx=Pn2x−1, i.e.,(2)x1−xP^n′x′+nn+1P^nx=0,0≤x≤1The same as the Legendre polynomials, the shifted Legendre polynomials can be expressed in terms of the independent variable x and vice versa,(3)P^0x=1,P^1x=2x−1,P^2x=6x2−6x+1,P^3x=20x3−30x2+12x−1,⋯⋯and(4)1=P^0x,x=1/2P^1x+P^0x,x2=1/6P^2x+3P^1x+2P^0x,x3=1/20P^3x+5P^2x+9P^1x+5P^0x,⋯⋯The shifted Legendre polynomials can be also written as binomial expansion(5)P^nx=1/n!dn/dxnxnx−1n=∑i=0n−1n−in+i2i2iixi.An important property of the shifted Legendre polynomialsP^nxis that they are orthogonal over [0,1], with(6)∫01P^nxP^mxdx=12n+1δnmBased on the definition of shifted Legendre polynomial, we can derive the substituted radial shifted Legendre polynomialsP¯nrby lettingP¯nr=P^nr2, i.e.,(7)P¯nr=P^nr2=∑i=0ncn,ir2i=∑i=0n−1n−in+i2i2iir2i.Fig. 2(d) shows the substituted radial shifted Legendre polynomials of 0–10th orders defined in [0,1].Theorem 1Radial shifted Legendre polynomials are orthogonal over on the interval [0,1] with weighting function r(8)∫01P¯nrP¯mrrdr=122n+1δnmBy substitutingP¯nr=Pnr2to Eq. (8), and with the help of Eq. (6), we have∫01P¯nrP¯mrrdr=12∫01P¯nrP¯mrdr2=12∫01P^nr2P^nr2dr2=122n+1δnmThe theorem is proved.With the help of shifted Legendre polynomials, we can define another kind of radial shifted Legendre polynomials named weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials orthogonal over (0,1] by introducing a scaling factor (a square root of 1/r) as(9)P˜nr=P^nrr=∑i=0n−1n−in+i2i2iiri−12,r≠0.Such that the orthogonal condition in Eq. (6) becomes(10)∫01P˜nrP˜mrrdr=∫01P^nrP^mrdr=12n+1δnmFig. 2(e) shows the weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials of 0–10th orders defined in (0,1].With the help of substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials, we can define the SRSLMs and WRSLMs in the polar coordinate as:(11)SRnm=2n+1π∫01∫02πfrθP¯nrexp⁡−jmθrdrdθ(12)WRnm=2n+12π∫01∫02πfrθP˜nrexp⁡−jmθrdrdθwhere f(r,θ) is the image function in polar coordinates and n=0,1,2,…,m=0,±1,±2,… is the moment order. Since both SRSLMs and WRSLMs are defined in terms of polar coordinates with, the computation of these two radial orthogonal moments requires a suitable transformation of the image coordinates to a domain inside a unit circle. Here, the mapping transformation proposed by Chong et al. [11] is used in this paper. Moreover, the kernel functionsP¯nrexp⁡−jmθof SRSLMs andP˜nrexp⁡−jmθof WRSLMs are orthogonal over the interior of the unit circle(13)∫01∫02πP¯nrexp⁡−jpθ*P¯mrexp⁡−jqθrdrdθ=π2n+1δnmδpq(14)∫01∫02πP˜nrexp⁡−jpθ∗P˜mrexp⁡−jqθrdrdθ=2π2n+1δnmδpqSimilar with classical orthogonal moments, the image function f(r,θ) can be reconstructed by SRSLMs and WRSLMs over the unit circle as(15)f¯rθ=∑n=1n⁢max⁡∑m=1m⁢max⁡SRnmP¯nrexp⁡jmθ(16)f¯rθ=∑n=0n⁢max⁡∑m=0m⁢max⁡WRnmP˜nrexp⁡jmθIn addition, the kernel functionP¯nrexp⁡−jmθ,P˜nrexp⁡jmθof SRSLMs and WRSLMs defined in Eqs. (11) and (12) can be expressed as complex polynomials in (x+jy) and (x−jy):(17)P¯nrexp⁡−jmθ=∑i=0ncn,ir2i⁢exp⁡−jmθ=∑i=0ncn,ix+jypx−jyq(18)P˜nrexp⁡−jmθ=∑i=0ncn,iri−12⁢exp⁡−jmθ=∑i=0ncn,ix+jysx−jytwhere(19)cn,i=−1n−in+i2i2ii,p=i−m2,q=i+m2,s=i−m2−14,t=i+m2−14Consequently, the SRSLMs and WRSLMs can be expressed as linear combination of CMs:(20)SRnm=2n+1π∑i=0ncn,iCMp,q,WRnm=2n+1π∑i=0ncn,iCMs,twhere CMp,qare CMs defined by Abu-Mostafa et al. in [18](21)CMp,q=∫−∞+∞∫−∞+∞fxyx+jypx−jyqdxdyBy definition, the moments order p and q are nonnegative integers. In this paper, the CMs are modified so that the orders p=i−m/2, q=i+m/2,s=i−m2−14andt=i+m2−14are real valued and can be negative. Therefore, the SRSLMs and WRSLMs can be regarded as orthogonal CMs and can be computed in the Cartesian coordinate system according to Eq. (20).From Eqs. (11) and (12), we can find that SRSLMs and WRSLMs have an orthogonal set of the radial polynomialP^nrandP˜nrfor all the circular harmonic order m, while ZMs and PZMs have a set of orthogonal radial polynomials for corresponding circular order m. Others, SRSLMs and WRSLMs can have n=0,1,2,… which are not permissible in ZMs and PZMs if n<|m|. Therefore, SRSLMs and WRSLMs of the degree n can perform better in image reconstruction than that of the ZMs and PZMs.As illustrated in Ref. [22], the number of zeros of the radial polynomials corresponds to the capability of the polynomial to describe high spatial frequency components of the image. Fig. 2 shows the plots of radial polynomials for each moments, with order n=0,1,2,..,10 for radial polynomialsP¯nrof SRSLMs,P˜nrof WRSLMs and Qn(r) of OFMs, with m=10, n=10,12,14,…,30 for radial polynomials Rn|m|(r) of ZMs, and with m=10, n=11, 12, 13,…,20 forR¯nmrof PZMs. As shown in this figure, the radial polynomialsP¯nr,P˜nrand Qn(r) have n zeros in the interior of the interval 0≤r≤1, while the radial polynomials of ZMs (Rn|m|(r)) have only (n−m)/2 zeros. This gives an advantage of SRSLMs and WRSLMs over ZMs in the case of minimal information redundancy and better noise robustness.Moreover, from Fig. 2, we can find that the zeros ofP¯nrandP˜nrare nearly uniformly distributed over the interval 0≤r≤1, whereas the zeros of Rn|m|(r) andR¯nmrare located at the region of larger r from the origin. Since in rotation, scale and translation invariant pattern recognition, the object sizes are unknown and the moments of objects of different size are computed with the same basis function. ZMs and PZMs have difficulty in describing small images. Therefore, SRSLMs and WRSLMs will perform better than ZMs and PZMs in invariant pattern recognition which has fairly large size variation.In order to reduce the computational cost of radial shifted Legendre moments on processor, the recurrence relation can be used to avoid the computational burden involved by mathematic functions like high order of factorial terms, powers of radius and the presence of trigonometric functions. As presented in [13], the Legendre polynomials obey the following recurrence relation(22)Pn+1x=2n+1n+1xPnx−nn+1Pn−1x,n≥1with P0(x)=1, P1(x)=x. According to the derivation of substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials, the three-term recurrence relation of substituted radial shifted Legendre polynomials with respect to n is(23)P¯n+1x=2n+1n+12x2−1P¯nx−nn+1P¯n−1x,n≥1withP¯0x=1,P¯1x=2x2−1, and for weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials:(24)P˜n+1x=2n+1n+12x−1Pnx−nn+1Pnx,n≥1withP˜0x=1x,P˜1x=2x−1x.The translation invariance of SRSLMs and WRSLMs can be easily achieved by transforming the original image to the geometric center before the calculation of radial shifted Legendre moments. In spite of the scaling and rotation invariance can be achieved by replacing complex moments in Eq. (20) with the complex moment invariants derived in [19] due to SRSLMs and WRSLMs can be expressed as linear combination of complex moments. In this subsection, we introduce a new and direct method to derive the scaling and rotation invariance of SRSLMs and WRSLMs.Let fsr(r,θ) be the scaled and rotated version of image function f(r,θ) with the scale factor λ and rotation angle ϕ, we have(25)fsrrθ=fr/λ,θ+ϕaccording to Eq. (11), the SRSLMs of scaled and rotated image is(26)SRnmsr=2n+1π∫01∫02πfr/λ,θ+ϕP¯nrexp⁡−jmθrdrdθBy letting r′=r/λ, θ′=θ+ϕ, we have r=λr′, θ=θ′−ϕ, dr=λdr′, dθ=dθ′, Eq. (26) can be written as(27)SRnmsr=λ22n+1π∫01∫02πfr′θ′P¯nλr′exp⁡−jmθ′−ϕr′dr′dθ′whereP¯nλris scaled version of substituted radial shifted Legendre polynomial.Lemma 1For lower triangular matrix Cnwhose elements cn,iare defined by Eq. (7), the elements di,kof the inverse matrix Dncan be given as follows:(28)di,k=2k+1i!i!i−k!i+k+1!The proof of Lemma 1 has been finished in Appendix A in Ref.

This paper proposed substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre moments (SRSLMs and WRSLMs) and their corresponding moment invariants for image analysis and invariant recognition. The proposed methods not only retain the properties of classical radial orthogonal moments such as better image reconstruction, lower information redundancy and higher robustness to noise, but also avoid the limitation of classical Legendre moments of difficulty to achieve completely translation, scaling and rotation invariance in invariant image recognition.The major contributions of this paper rely on three aspects. First, two new types of orthogonal polynomials (substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials) were derived. These derived orthogonal polynomials are the transformed versions of classical Legendre polynomials and orthogonal on a disk. Second, we used the substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre polynomials to construct two radial orthogonal moments named substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre moments (SRSLMs and WRSLMs). These proposed moments were defined in polar coordinate and can be expressed as linear combination of complex moments. Third, we presented a mathematical framework of obtaining the translation, scaling and rotation invariant of substituted and weighted radial shifted Legendre moments. It is the first to derive rotation, scaling and translation invariance based on substituted and weighted Legendre moments.It's worth to mention that, the substituted and weighted methods for classical Legendre polynomials proposed in this paper are generic methods. Any orthogonal polynomials satisfying Eq. (6) can be converted into Eqs. (8) and (10) by substitution and weighting. With the help of these two methods, orthogonal moments defined in Cartesian coordinates can be redefined in polar coordinates and their rotation invariance can be easily achieved.
