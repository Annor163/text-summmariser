@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the advancement in the field of information technology and medicine, there is an increasing demand for transmitting medical images over the public network [1,2]. Digital medical records provide efficient tool for diagnosis, surgery and treatment than any other mechanisms. For example, for critical diagnosis taking the organs or tissues outside the body and imaging them is really impossible. Medical imaging is the special technique of creating images of the human's interior organs. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) provide the digitized storage and transmission of medical images [3,4]. DICOM is the widely preferred communication standard to support the standard interface between almost all the developed medical imaging modalities. Yet, it offers only limited security and the level of security is up to the modality manufacturers.The conventional security mechanisms deployed in current medical systems are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA). Due to several intrinsic behaviours of DICOM, these traditional techniques are less efficient or take huge computational time to secure them. The intrinsic behaviours of medical image include (i) bulk pixel capacity, (ii) large data size, (iii) high correlation among pixels, (iv) high redundancy and (v) low resolution. To meet these security challenges various conventional security algorithms have been proposed by many researchers [5–9]. The fascinating relationships between chaos and cryptography have attracted many researchers to develop various encryption schemes based on 1-D and 2-D chaotic maps in the past two decades [10]. The interesting features like strong ergodicity, elevated randomness and high sensitivity to initial conditions have made the chao-cryptic system to be well suited for performing stronger image encryption [11–17]. The fusion of chaotic system and cryptography has evolved as the supreme solution for establishing secured medical image storage and transmission. Extensive research has been available for digital image encryption with chaotic cryptography but only few works have been reported with chaos based cryptosystem for securing medical images. Some of the major contributions are briefly reported below.The first chaos based image encryption system was proposed by Fridrich et al. [18]. This work comprises two important modules namely, the confusion–diffusion or permutation–substitution units. According to the chaotic sequences generated, the pixel values are shuffled and modified in the confusion and diffusion units respectively. In [19], Shun Zhang et al. proposed a novel medical image encryption system based on hyperchaotic system. The generated chaotic sequences are iterated by Runge–Kutta algorithm to get the complete sequence necessary for encrypting the medical image. The cipher image is obtained by XORing the image pixels with the iterated hyperchaotic sequences. In [20], Sathish Kumar et al. suggested the dual chaos based medical image encryption algorithm, where the shuffling and scrambling are done through chaotic circular shifting. In [21], a tri layer cryptic system based on Latin square image cipher, Rubik's cube and discrete Gould transform has been designed to shuffle, scramble and authenticate the DICOM. This tri layer cryptic solution the resistance towards tamper proofing and brute force attack. In [22], true random numbers generated from the chaotic sequence are used to scramble the image pixels. This work is 100 times faster than the standard AES for scrambling medical images. In [23,24], chaotic cat maps are employed to scramble the image pixels. In [24], the Arnold cat map is utilized to strongly eliminate the correlation among adjacent pixels and logistic map plays a key role in confusing the pixels between plain and cipher image. In [23], the block based shuffling and masking are done to make the system immune against differential and brute force attacks. Though these schemes achieve better security compared with traditional encryption system, they are still inefficient to perform effective encryption. This is because of their non-uniform key distribution and limited erratic range of chaotic sequences [25–28]. In order to overcome these difficulties, many researchers have adapted higher dimensional chaotic maps [29–32]. In [29], the 3D chaotic map is employed to permute and diffuse the DICOM image pixels. In this work it can be seen that three or four variables are used for shuffling the image pixels in the plain image. This enhances the security against known/ chosen plain-text attack. Along with the increased security, the higher dimensional chaotic map increases the computational overhead. On the other side, the 1-D chaotic maps are easy and simple to implement [12,27,33–36].By considering the pros and cons of 1D chaotic maps, some researchers have started their research on combining multiple 1D chaotic maps in single platform for generating effective random sequences. The combined chaotic system tends to overcome the disadvantages of 1D and higher order chaotic maps [37–45]. In [44], three 1D combined chaotic maps are proposed to achieve the tradeoff between computational cost and security. This system achieved better encryption results with reduced computational cost compared with higher order chaotic maps. In [38], the larger key space is achieved by combining complex Chen and complex Lorentz maps. In permutation phase, the combined maps shuffle the red, green and blue image pixels individually. Simple XOR operation alters the three plane pixels to make the system to achieve multilayer security. In [46], the two coupled logistic map scrambles the medical image. The scrambled DICOM is split into two components to generate the cipher image with noise distribution. In [45], the Combined Two dimensional Piecewise Nonlinear Chaotic map (CTPCM) is designed to scramble and mask the plain image.Majority of the medical image encryption schemes have employed only single chaotic map for shuffling and diffusing the image pixels. The major advantages of combining multiple chaotic maps are (i) enlarged key space, (ii) elevated randomness, (iii) uniform key distribution, (iv) increased chaotic range. Hence, this work aims to propose a novel bio-inspired chao-cryptic encryption scheme based on combining two 1-D chaotic maps in single mechanism for encrypting the medical images. The proposed medical image encryption scheme comprises two phases namely, crossover and mutation. The crossover and mutation operations are performed based on the random sequences generated from combined chaotic maps.
