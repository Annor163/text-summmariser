@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper addresses how asymmetric information, fads and Lévy jumps in the price of an asset affect the optimal portfolio strategies and maximum expected utilities of two distinct classes of rational investors in a financial market. We obtain the investors’ optimal portfolios and maximum expected logarithmic utilities and show that the optimal portfolio of each investor is more or less than its Merton optimal. Our approximation results suggest that jumps reduce the excess asymptotic utility of the informed investor relative to that of uninformed investor, and hence jump risk could be helpful for market efficiency as an indirect reducer of information asymmetry. Our study also suggests that investors should pay more attention to the overall variance of the asset pricing process when jumps exist in fads models. Moreover, if there are very little or too much fads, then the informed investor has no utility advantage in the long run.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Asset pricing and portfolio selection problems are central issues in financial engineering. In an efficient market, it is assumed that asset prices always fully reflect available information, and all investors have the same amount of information to utilize for portfolio selection. However, one of the most striking developments of the last few decades was how the most dearly held notions of market efficiency, the positive relationship between return and non-diversifiable risk, and dividend discount models were put into question. This was due to the strong unanticipated price volatility in asset markets such as stock, bond, currency and real estate markets. Empirical studies in LeRoy and Porter (1981) and Shiller (1981) were among the first to assert that there are many market anomalies including excess volatility caused by investor overreaction and under-reaction, fashions and fads (mispricing). More recent behavioral finance articles such as Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara (2002), Yuan (2005), Easley, Engle, O’Hara, and Wu (2008), Bharath, Pasquariello, and Wu (2009), Caskey (2009), Biais, Bossaerts, and Spatt (2010), Hayunga and Lung (2011), Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012), Serrano-Padial (2012), Vayanos and Wang (2012) and Mendel and Shleifer (2012) also argued for the existence of these market anomalies. Consequently, it is a fact that the asset pricing and portfolio selection should be studied in an inefficient framework.According to Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012), information asymmetry has a substantial effect on asset prices and demands which affects assets through a liquidity channel. Asset pricing models under asymmetric information rely on a noisy rational expectation equilibrium in which prices partially reveal the better informed investors’ information due to randomness in the assets supply. Examples of such studies are Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Admati (1985), Wang (1993) and Easley and O’Hara (2004) who show that increases in information asymmetry lead to a fall in share prices and a reduction in uninformed investors’ demand for the risky asset. Thus, asymmetric information plays an important role in asset pricing models when it exists.The link between asset mispricing and asymmetric information was first studied by Shiller (1981) and Summers (1986) in a purely deterministic and discrete setting, and later extended by Wang (1993), Guasoni (2006) and Buckley, Brown, and Marshall (2012) to the purely continuous random environment. In this framework, it is assumed that the asset has both the fundamental value and market value, and there are two types of investors: informed investors (i.e., institutional investors with internal research capabilities), who observe both fundamental and market values, and uninformed investors (i.e., retail investors who rely on public information in order to make investment choices), who only observe market values. The difference between the market value and the fundamental value represents the current mispricing of the asset.It is well known that asset return distributions are heavy tailed and skewed, which are at odds with the classical geometric Brownian motion models. Lévy models are among the most popular alternative models proposed to address this issue. Jumps in asset prices can have a very big impact on returns and mispricing. According to Summers (1986), asset prices can have large jumps away from their fundamental values. This leads to potentially large increases in fads. Consequently, the impact of fads may be more significant in affecting investment strategies and expected utility when asset prices jump. In this spirit, we propose a mispricing model under asymmetric information in a Lévy market where asset price jumps, while the mispricing is modeled by a continuous Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and utility is logarithmic. We obtain explicit formulas for optimal portfolios and maximum expected logarithmic utilities for both the informed and uninformed investors, and prove that the optimal portfolio of each investor is more or less than its Merton optimal.Under quadratic approximation of the portfolios, we show that the investors hold excess risky asset if and only if the ratio of first and second instantaneous centralized moments of return is greater than the Merton optimal. We also show that the excess asymptotic utility of the informed investor has an identical structure to continuous market counterpart, except that it is much less as a result of having a smaller adjusted mean reversion speed, which has a dampening effect on the excess utility. This adjusted mean-reversion speed, is a fraction of the original reversion speed of the mispricing process that has been reduced by the extra volatility arising from the jumps in the asset price. Notwithstanding the presence of asymmetric information, mispricing and jumps, our model shows that it pays to be more informed in the long run. However, if there is no mispricing, the informed investor has no utility advantage in the long run. Our study also shows that the overall variance of the asset process becomes more important for investors when jumps exist in the asset market.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related literature. Section 3 presents the model, which includes filtrations and price dynamics of informed and uninformed investors. In Section 4, we consider the maximization problem of logarithmic utilities and obtain the optimal portfolios for informed and uninformed investors. Asymptotic results and quadratic approximations of logarithmic utilities and optimal portfolios are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. All the proofs and additional results are given in the Appendix.Discrete-time mispricing (fads) models for stocks under asymmetric information were first introduced by Shiller (1981) and Summers (1986), as plausible alternatives to the efficient market or constant expected returns assumption (cf Fama, 1970). Brunnermeier (2001) presented an extensive review of asset pricing under asymmetric information mainly in the discrete setting. He showed how information affects trading activity, and that expected return depends on the information set or filtration of the investor. These models show that past prices still carry valuable information, which can be exploited using technical (chart) analysis that uses part or all of past prices to predict future prices.Wang (1993) presented the first continuous-time asset pricing model under asymmetric information, and obtained optimal portfolios for both the informed and uninformed investors. In this paper, investors have different information concerning the future growth rate of dividends, which satisfies a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Informed investors know the future dividend growth rate, while the uninformed investors do not. All investors observe current dividend payments and stock prices. The growth rate of dividends determines the rate of appreciation of stock prices, and stock price changes provide signals about the future growth of dividends. Uninformed investors rationally extract information about the economy from prices, as well as dividends. Hence, in this paper, the fundamental value of the asset at any point is a function of stock price, dividend stream and dividend growth rate while mispricing is a function of dividend growth rate only.Guasoni (2006) extends Shiller (1981) and Summers (1986) models to the purely continuous random setting. He studies a continuous-time version of these models both from the point of view of informed investor, who observe both fundamental and market values, and from that of uninformed investor, who only observe market prices. He specifies the asset price in the larger filtration of the informed investor, and then derive its decomposition in the smaller filtration of the uninformed investor using the Hitsuda representation of Gaussian processes. Uninformed investors, have a non-Markovian dynamics, which justifies the use of technical analysis in optimal trading strategies. For both types of investors, he solves the problem of maximization of expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth, and obtain an explicit formula for the additional logarithmic utility of informed agents. He also applies the decomposition result to the problem of testing the presence of fads from market data. An application to the NYSE-AMEX indices from the CRSP database shows that, if the fads component prevails, then the mean-reversion speed must be slow.Buckley et al. (2012) extended Guasoni’s model for stocks following geometric Brownian motion to constant relative risk averse investors when mispricing follows a continuous mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. They obtained analogous but more general results which nests those of Guasoni (2006) as a special case of the relative risk aversion being one. Even though the notions of asymmetric information and fads in our model is analogous to Guasoni (2006), Buckley et al. (2012) and Wang (1993), we model the asset dynamics using a Lévy process motivated by Schoutens (2003), Cont and Tankov (2004), Kyprianou, Schoutens, and Wilmott (2005), Singleton (2006), Kou (2007), Øksendal and Sulem (2007) and Wu (2007). Our model applies to any asset that has a fundamental value and the mispricing is simply the difference between the fundamental value and the observed value of the asset. Hence, our model is applicable to broader class of assets such as stock, bond, currency and real estate. Furthermore, we obtain the maximum expected utilities for both the informed and uninformed investors in a Lévy jump market. Hence, our model is more general and applicable, since it captures jumps, and as such, practically different from the extant literature.It is also worth noting that our specification of the information asymmetry is different from that of the insider trading models such as Karatzas and Pikovsky (1996) and Amendinger, Imkeller, and Schweizer (1998). Like Guasoni (2006), we specify the price dynamic in the larger filtration of the informed investor, and then obtain the dynamic for the uninformed investor by contracting the larger filtration using the Hitsuda representation. In contrast, insider trading models specify the asset price dynamic of the smaller filtration of the uninformed investor. The novel information available to the insider (informed) investor is then added to the filtration of the uninformed to create the filtration of the insider investor by enlargement.The model consists of two assets, namely a riskless asset B called bond, bank account or money market, with priceBt=exp∫0trsds, and a risky asset S, called asset in the sequel for simplicity. The bond earns a continuously compounded risk-free interest ratert, while the continuous component of asset’s percentage appreciation rate or expected return isμt, at timet∈[0,T]. The asset is subject to volatilityσt>0. Market parametersμt,rtandσtare assumed to be deterministic functions.There are two investor classes consisting of informed and uninformed investors. The informed investor indexed byi=1, has knowledge of both the asset price and its fundamental or true value. Consequently, the informed investor has knowledge of the mispricing in the asset price at each time t, in the investment period[0,T]. The uninformed investor, indexed byi=0, has knowledge of the asset price only. Although this investor is aware of the existence of mispricing, it cannot be observed directly. This investor therefore resorts to the use of technical analysis to assist in trading. Parameters and other characteristics of informed and uninformed investors, are indexed by “1” and “0”, respectively. Investors have filtrations (information flows)Hticontained inF, whereHt0⊂Ht1⊂F,t∈[0,T]. All random objects for the ith investor live on a filtered probability space(Ω,F,Hi,P).Although each investor observes the same asset price S, its dynamic depends on the filtration of the observer. We assume that the asset has log return dynamic:(1)d(logSt)=(μt-12σt2)dt+σtdYt+dXt,t∈[0,T],(2)Yt=pWt+qUt,p2+q2=1,p⩾0,q⩾0,(3)dUt=-λUtdt+dBt,λ>0,U0=0,(4)Xt=∫0t∫RxN(ds,dx),where W and B are independent standard Brownian motions independent of X, whileU=(Ut)is a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with rateλ, and X is a pure jump Lévy process having a sigma-finite Lévy measure v onB(R-{0}), with triple(γ,0,v)whereγ=∫|x|<1xv(dx). N is a Poisson random measure onR+×B(R-{0})that is linked to the asset. It counts the jumps of X in the time interval(0,t).The return of the asset has three components; a continuous componentμt∗=μt-12σt2; a diffusive componentσtYtwhich is random, and a discontinuous componentXt, which is also random. The processY=(Yt)t⩾0, the continuous random component of excess return, and the mean-reverting O-U processU=(Ut)t⩾0representing the mispricing, are defined as in Guasoni (2006), where U satisfies the Langevin stochastic differential Eq. (3). This admits a unique solutionUt=U0e-λt+∫0te-λ(t-s)dBs=∫0te-λ(t-s)dBs,withEUt=0andEUt2=Var(Ut)=12λ(1-e-2λt). Applying Itô’s formula to (1) yields the percentage return dynamic:(5)dStSt-=μtdt+σtdYt+∫R(ex-1)N(dt,dx),t∈[0,T].By solving the Eq. (5), we haveSt=S0exp∫0t(μs-12σs2)ds+∫0tσsdYs+Xt.For the informed investor, we takeH1=(Ht1)t⩾0to be the completed filtration generated byW,Band X, augmented by theP-null sets ofF. That is, the filtration of the informed investor isHt1≜σ(Ws,Bs,Xs:s⩽t)∨σ(N),whereN={D⊂Ω:∃A∈F,D⊂A,P(A)=0}.The uninformed investor observes only the asset price S and does not have any information on the mispricing process U, although that investor may be aware that mispricing exists. These investors have filtrationH0=(Ht0)t⩾0defined asHt0=Ft0∨σ(Xu:u⩽t),t∈[0,T],whereFt0=σ(Ys:s⩽t)with Y and X are defined by Eqs. (2)–(4). Note that X and Y are independent, sinceX,W,Uare independent. Clearly,Ft0⊂Ht0⊂Ht1⊂F.We shall establish asset price dynamics for the two types of investors based on the corresponding information flows of the investors. For the informed investor, from (2) and (3), we have(6)dYt=υt1dt+dBt1,whereυt1=-λqUt, andB1=pW+qB. By using Lévy Characterization Theorem (cf Applebaum, 2004 or Protter, 2004), it is easy to see thatB1is anH1-adapted Brownian motion. Applying the Eq. (6) to Eq. (5) yields the percentage return dynamic of informed investor(7)dStSt-=μt1dt+σtdBt1+∫R(ex-1)N(dt,dx),whereμt1=μt+υt1σt. For the uninformed investor, from Theorem 2.1 of Guasoni (2006), there exist anF0-Brownian motionB0and a processυt0adapted toFt0, such that for eacht∈[0,T],(8)dYt=υt0dt+dBt0,whereυt0=-λ∫0te-λ(t-u)(1+γ(u))dBu0withγ(u)=1-p21+ptanh(pλu)-1. SinceFt0⊂Ht0, thenBt0andυt0are also adapted toHt0. Applying the Eq. (8) to Eq. (5) yields the percentage return dynamic of uninformed investor(9)dStSt-=μt0dt+σtdBt0+∫R(ex-1)N(dt,dx),t∈[0,T],whereμt0=μt+υt0σt.We obtain optimal portfolios and derive closed-form solutions of the maximum expected utilities for both the informed and uninformed investors in this section. We first need to introduce some preliminary definitions before we present our main results of this section.Definition 1The processπ≡πi:[0,T]×Ω⟶Ris called the portfolio process of the ith investor, ifπtiisHti-adapted andE∫0T(πtiσt)2dt<∞.Note thatπtiis reallyπti(ω),ω∈Ωand hence, is a random process.πtiis the proportion of the wealth of the ith investor that is invested in the risky asset at timet∈[0,T]. The remainder,1-πti, is invested in the bond or money market. Where it is clear, we drop the superscript “i” and simply useπfor the portfolio process.Definition 2The wealth process for the ith investor isVi,π,x:[0,T]×Ω⟶RwhereVti,π,xis the value of the portfolio consisting of the risky asset and bond at time t, whenπtiis invested in the risky asset and the initial capital isx>0.For brevity, we denote this process byVi,π=(Vti,π)or simplyVi=(Vti),t∈[0,T]when the context is clear.LetVtibe the wealth of the ith investor at time t resulting from the investment ofπtiin the risky asset. Assume that the bond earns continuously compounded risk-free interest ratert. Letnti≡ntbe the number of risky assets in the portfolio at time t. Thenπti=ntSt-Vt-i, whereVt-iis the value of the portfolio just before time t. It follows thatdVti=(1-πti)Vt-irtdt+ntdSt=(1-πti)Vt-irtdt+πtiVt-idStSt-.ThereforedVtiVt-i=(1-πti)rtdt+πtidStSt-. By using the asset percentage return dynamics (7) and (9), the wealth processViof the ith investor has dynamic(10)dVtiVt-i=(πtiσtθti+rt)dt+πtiσtdBti+∫Rπti(ex-1)N(dt,dx),whereθi=μi-rσis the Sharpe ratio. By applying Doleans-Dade exponentials to the Eq. (10), we find that the discounted valueV∼ti=Vtiexp-∫0trsdsis given by(11)V∼ti=V0iexp∫0t[πsiσsθsi-12(πsi)2σs2]ds+∫0tπsiσsdBsi+∫0t∫Rlog(1+πsi(ex-1))N(ds,dx).From the foregoing, we may effectively set the interest rate r to be zero, and use the discounted wealth processV∼iinstead of the wealth processVi, to analyze the utility from terminal wealth. ThusVTiis equivalent to the discounted terminal wealthV∼Ti. Consequently, we maximize the utility from terminal wealth using the discounted terminal wealthV∼Ti.For analytical tractability, we assume that all investors have logarithmic utility functionu(x)=logx. LetG(π)≜∫Rlog(1+π(ex-1))v(dx)forπ∈[0,1]. From the terminal wealthV∼Tigiven by (11) witht=TandV0i=x, we get(12)u(V∼Ti)=logx+∫0T(πsiσsθsi-12(πsi)2σs2)ds+∫0TπsiσsdBsi+∫0T∫Rlog(1+πsi(ex-1))N(ds,dx).Taking expectation of (12) yieldsEu(V∼Ti,πi)≡ElogV∼Ti,πi=logV0i+E∫0T(πsiσsθsi-12(πsi)2σs2)ds+E∫0TπsiσsdBsi+E∫0T∫Rlog(1+πsi(ex-1))N(ds,dx),=logV0i+E∫0T(πsiσsθsi-12(πsi)2σs2)ds+E∫0TG(πsi)ds.Sinceπtiσtθti-12(πti)2σt2=12(θti)2-12(πtiσt-θti)2, the expected logarithmic utility from discounted terminal wealthV∼Tifor the ith investor is given by(13)Eu(V∼Ti,πi)=logV0i+12E∫0T(θti)2dt+E∫0Tfi(πti)dt,where(14)fi(πti)=-12(πtiσt-θti)2+G(πti).Now letV0i=x. We seek a portfolio processπ=(πt)t⩾0in an admissible setAi(x)defined byAi(x)={πi;πiisHi-predictablesuchthatV∼ti,πi>0a.s.∀t∈[0,T]}.πis predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable sigma-algebra on[0,T]×Ω, which is the sigma-algebra of all left continuous functions with right limits on[0,T]×Ω. The optimal portfolio for the ith investor isπ∗,i∈Ai(x)such thatE(logV∼Ti,π∗,i)=maxπ∈Ai(x)ElogV∼Ti,π.That is,π∗,i=argmaxπ∈Ai(x)ElogV∼Ti,π.Sinceθt≡θtidoes not depend onπt, we see from (13) thatElogV∼Ti,πis maximized if and only ifE∫0Tfi(πti)dtis maximized. That is, iff(π)is maximized on the admissible setAi(x). This approach is similar to the optimization method used by Liu, Longstaff, and Pan (2003), and yields the same optimal as the HJB approach. We can now present the main results of this section.Theorem 1Assume thatG(·)is twice differentiable with respect toπ.(a)Letπi∈Ai(x)andh(πi)=-πi+θiσ+G′(πi)σ2withi∈{0,1}, thenfi(π)is strictly concave onR, with unique maximum atπ∗,i, which is the optimal portfolio for the ith investor and satisfiesh(πt∗,i)=0, i.e.πt∗,i=θtiσt+G′(πt∗,i)σt2,t∈[0,T]. Furthermore, ifh(0)=θiσ+1σ2∫R(ex-1)ν(dx)⩾0andh(1)=-1+θiσ+1σ2∫R(1-e-x)ν(dx)⩽0, then there exists a unique admissible optimal portfolioπt∗,i∈Ai(x).(b)For the ith investor, the maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth is given byui(x)≡maxπ∈Ai(x)ElogV∼Ti,π=logx+12E∫0T(θti)2dt+E∫0Tfi(πt∗,i)dt,whereπt∗,i∈Ai(x)is the optimal portfolio for the ith investor.We first note that the optimal portfolioπ∗,iis random in general and becomes deterministic when there is no information asymmetry. When there is information asymmetry, the drift term in the return dynamics are random, and hence, the optimal demand for the risky asset is random. If there is no information asymmetry, then both investors observe both fundamental and market values of the asset. Hence, there is no mispricing, which meansU≡0, and therefore the return dynamics are the same, yielding a common deterministic Merton optimal for the demand of the risky asset.We can also analyze our results in Theorem 1 in terms of continuous and discrete parts, in line with the Merton’s GBM model. The Merton (1971) optimal portfolioπMer∗for an asset with GBM dynamics:dSt=μtStdt+σtStdBt, isπMer∗(t)=θtσt=μt-rtσt2. We now define fort∈[0,T],πt,ci=θiσt,πt,di=G′(πti)σt2,uT,ci(x)=logx+12E∫0T(θti)2dtanduT,di(x)=E∫0Tfi(πti)dt, whereπt,ciandπt,diare the continuous and discrete components, respectively, of the portfolioπt, anduT,cianduT,diare corresponding components of the maximum expected logarithmic utility based on an optimal portfolioπwith investment horizon T. The processesπt,ciandπt,diare assumed to be adapted to their filtrationsHifori∈{0,1}.With these notations, part(a)of Theorem 1 states that for both the informed and uninformed investors, there is a unique optimal portfolioπ∗,i∈Ai(x), such thatπ∗,i=πc∗,i+πd∗,i≡πMer∗,i+πd∗,i, whereπc∗,iis the Merton optimal1The classical definition of the Merton (1971) optimal portfolio,πMer∗is presented for an asset with GBM dynamics, andπMer∗is deterministic. In our case,πMer∗,iis defined for asset dynamicsdSt=μtiStdt+σtStdBti, for each investor with mispricing, andπMer∗,iis random. However, we still callπMer∗,ithe Merton optimal portfolio as the underline definitions are identical.1andπd∗,iis the excess asset holding resulting from the jumps for ith investor. Furthermore, part(b)establishes that the maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for each investor, havingx>0in initial wealth, is given byui(x)≡uTi(x)=uT,ci(x)+uT,di(x). That is,u(x)≡uT(x)=uT,c(x)+uT,d(x), whereuT,c(x)is the maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for the purely continuous Merton case with optimal portfolioπc∗anduT,d(x)is the excess utility resulting from the jumps.The valueuT,d(x)depends on the growth rate of G. We achieve optimality if G is twice differentiable. That is, ifG″(π)=-∫R(ex-1)2v(dx)(1+π(ex-1))2finitely exists. If we restrictπto the interval[0,1), thenG″(π)<∞whenever∫R(ex-1)2v(dx)<∞. Ifπ=1, thenG′′(π)exists if∫R(e-x-1)2v(dx)<∞. Therefore, if no short-selling(π<0)or borrowing(π>1)from the bank account is allowed, and∫R(e±x-1)2v(dx)<∞, then Theorem 1 holds.In the sequel, we assume thatπ∈[0,1]unlessG(π)can be explicitly computed, such as in the special case where jumps are driven by linear combinations of Poisson processes, in which case the restrictionπ∈[0,1], is relaxed. This restriction is required to ensure that the second derivative of the partial objective functionG(π)exists which then leads to the existence of an optimal portfolio. If the Lévy measure is such that the second derivative exists in a wider interval[a,b], witha<0andb>1, then the restriction of no short selling and borrowing is not required. Alternatively, sinceG(π)is defined as an integral dependent on the Lévy measure, one could numerically determine its support, and hence the admissible set, by finding the largest interval[a,b]for which the integral and its derivatives exist. Ifa<0andb>1we drop the no borrowing and short selling constraints. The restriction holds for most other cases such as markets driven by Variance Gamma (cf Madan & Milne, 1991; Madan, Carr, & Chang, 1998; Madan & Seneta, 1990 & Barndorff-Nielson, 1995), CGMY (cf Carr, Geman, Madan, & Yor, 2002), and Jump-diffusion processes (cf Merton, 1971; Kou, 2002).The following useful result is presented without the superscript “i”.Proposition 1Assume thatπ∈[0,1]and∫R(e±x-1)2v(dx)<∞. Letα=πc∗=πMer∗be the Merton optimal for each investor. Then, there existsψαbetweenαandπ∗such that the optimal portfolio that maximizes the expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth,π∗=α+G′(α)σ2+|G″(ψα)|.For each investor, the excess asset holding over its Merton optimalα, isπd∗=G′(α)σ2+|G″(ψα)|. Note that this excess holding of asset is strictly due to the presence of jumps. Observe that we have a positive or negative excess over the Merton optimal in lock-step with the sign ofG′(α). That is, the investor holds a positive or negative excess depending on whether G is increasing or decreasing at the Merton optimal,α.In general, we have to use numerical methods to computeG′(α)as it may not be possible to find the value analytically. However, the numerical procedure should be viable for most of the widely used jump processes. Here we provide some sufficient conditions on the sign ofG′(α)for Kou (2002) Jump-Diffusion model. In the Kou model, jump sizes follow an asymmetric double-exponential distribution with Lévy density of the form(15)ν(dx)=κpuκ+e-κ+xI{x>0}+(1-pu)κ-e-κ-|x|I{x<0}dx,whereκ+>0,κ->0govern the decay of the tails for the distribution of positive and negative jump sizes respectively andpu∈[0,1]represents the probability of an upward jump. Hereκis the intensity of the Poisson process that drives the jumps-diffusion process. After some basic calculation, we find thatG′(α)=κ∫0∞pue-κ+x(αex+(1-α))2-(1-pu)e-κ-x((1-α)ex+α)2exdx.Now letρ=1-pupu. Then, in terms of the values of the involved parameters, some sufficient conditions on the sign ofG′(α)can be categorized as follows. First, in the case ofκ+=κ-, we have that (a) ifpu⩾12andα<11+ρ, thenG′(α)>0; (b) ifpu⩽12andα>11+ρ, thenG′(α)<0; (c) ifpu=12andα=12, thenG′(α)=0. Second, in the case ofκ+>κ-, ifpu⩽12andα⩾11+ρ, thenG′(α)<0. Third, in the case ofκ+<κ-, ifpu⩾12andα⩽11+ρ, thenG′(α)>0. This type of characterization using the model parameters would be useful for an investor to determine whether he has to hold an excess in practice.We present the asymptotic results of the maximum expected utility and approximated results of the utilities and optimal portfolios of both the investors in this section. These results are important to understand the long run behavior of the investors. We setr=0without loss of generality.LetuTi(x)be the maximum expected logarithmic utility of the ith investor resulting from an optimal portfolioπ∗,iover the investment horizon T. Sincer=0, the asset’s Sharpe ratio for the ith investor isθi=μiσ=μ+υiσσ=μσ+υi. We now provide the asymptotic utilities of investors.Theorem 2Letx>0be the initial capital of the investors andi∈{0,1}. AsT⟶∞, the maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for the ith investor, isuTi(x)given byuTi(x)=uT,ci(x)+uT,di(x)∼logx+12∫0Tμtσt2dt+λT4(1-p)(1+(-1)i+1p)+Tϕπ∗,i(i),wherep∈[0,1], anduT,ci(x)∼logx+12∫0Tμtσt2dt+λT4(1-p)(1+(-1)i+1p),uT,di(x)∼Tϕπ∗,i(i), andϕπ∗,i(i)∼limt→∞Efi(πt∗,i).Moreover, the asymptotic excess utility of the informed investor isuT1(x)-uT0(x)∼λT2p(1-p)+T(ϕπ∗,1(1)-ϕπ∗,0(0)).Theorem 2 provides the long-term behavior of the logarithmic utilities for both informed and uninformed investors. Compared to the purely continuous fads models, we have extra asymptotic utilitiesuT,di(x)due to jumps, which depend on the equilibrium states of the optimal portfolios. In addition, the asymptotic excess utility of informed investor also has an extra term due to jumps. However, it is not easy to give analytic expression for this extra excess utility. In the Appendix, we give an approximated explicit formula forϕπ∗,i(i)based on our results in next sub section.In this section, forα=θ/σ(Merton optimal portfolio), we derive some useful formulas based on the assumption thatG(α)is approximated by a Taylor expansion built from two instantaneous centralized momentsM1andM2, defined below. This approximation leads to very nice consequences under the assumption that there existsk⩾2, such that∫R(e±x-1)kv(dx)<∞to ensure thatG(k)(α)exists on[0,1]andG″(α)<0.We first introduce some extremely useful objects linked to the Lévy measure that will be instrumental in computing approximations.Definition 3(Instantaneous Centralized Moments of Return) Letj∈{1,2,…,k}. Define the jth instantaneous centralized moment of return for the asset with dynamics (1) by the prescription:Mj≜∫R(ex-1)jv(dx).Mjis well defined because∫R(e±x-1)jv(dx)<∞, andG(j)(0)=(-1)j-1(j-1)!∫R(ex-1)jv(dx)=(-1)j-1(j-1)!Mj,whenceMj=(-1)j-1G(j)(0)(j-1)!.Now define the functionsA,B,Coft,σ,M1,M2, by the prescriptions:At≜-M22(σt2+M2);Bt≜M1σt(σt2+M2);Ct≜M122(σt2+M2).LetQ(θ)≡Q(θ:σ,M1,M2)=Aθ2+Bθ+C,A∞=limt→∞At=-M22(σ∞2+M2)andσ∞=limt→∞σt. We have the following important result.Theorem 3(a)LetG(α)be defined on[0,1]. Under quadratic approximation of G, the optimal portfolio for each investor isπ∗≈α+M1-M2ασ2+M2.(b)The jump component of the maximum expected utility for the ith investor resulting from quadratic approximation of G is(16)uT,di(x)≈E∫0TQθti:σt,M1,M2dt,i∈{0,1}.(c)Under quadratic approximation, asT⟶∞, the maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for the ith investor withx>0in initial wealth, is(17)uTi(x)∼logx+12∫0Tμtσt2dt+∫0TQμtσtdt+λ̃4(1-p)(1+(-1)i+1p)T,whereλ̃≜λ(1+2A∞)=λσ∞2σ∞2+M2is the adjusted mean-reversion rate of the driving O-U process.(d)The excess asymptotic optimal utility of the informed investor isuT1(x)-uT0(x)∼λ̃2p(1-p)T.We first observe from part(a)of Theorem 3 that under quadratic approximation, an investor holds excess risky asset if and only if the ratio of first and second instantaneous centralized moment of return (M1M2) is greater that the Merton optimal,α. These moments are determined strictly by the Lévy measure driving the jumps in the asset price and can be computed easily for a given Lévy density.We also note that part(d)of Theorem 3 is analogous to Guasoni (2006)’s major result of Theorem 3.1 for excess asymptotic utility, given byλ2p(1-p)T,whereλis the mean-reversion rate for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Its maximum is still achieved atp=12, which is equivalent to a market where the mispricing level is at 75%. Note in our case, the influence of the mean-reversion rate for the O–U process on the expected logarithmic utilities is reduced toλ̃=λσ∞2σ∞2+M2, instead ofλas in the purely continuous GBM market. The quantityσ∞2+M2is the total variance or squared volatility of the asset pricing process, whereM2is the contribution due to jump risk. Thus, the effective mean reversion speed of the mispricing process is reduced to a fraction of its original speed when jumps exist, thereby reducing the overall long-run excess utility advantage of the informed investor in contrast to the strictly GBM continuous case where asset price diffuses only without jumps. Consequently, if mispricing is continuous, jumps in asset price appear to add more efficiency to the market by reducing the end of period utility advantage of the informed investor. That is, it appears that jumps indirectly increase the informational advantage of the uninformed investor (information asymmetry) by directly reducing the utility advantage of the informed investor. This is a surprising consequence of our model. However, if the diffusive variance (σ2) is large relative to the jump variance (M2), then for all practical purposes, the excess utility is essentially its continuous counterpart, which is its maximum possible level.It is also worth noting that, whether or not jumps exist, there is no excess utility advantage of the informed investor when the market is totally free of mispricing or is completely mispriced. The excess expected optimal utility is proportional top(1-p), wherep=1-q2andq2is the proportion of mispricing. If there is no mispricing, thenq2=0and the fundamental and asset prices are equal. This yieldsp=1, and hence there is no excess utility. If the market is completely mispriced, thenq2=1, and hencep=0which leads to no excess utility. Equivalently, both return dynamics are equal since they are driven by a common Brownian motion B. This yields the same optimal demand for the risky asset for each investor, and hence the same optimal expected utility. Thus, there is no difference in optimal utility. Therefore, superior knowledge of the informed investor does not translate to any utility advantages when the market is symmetric (q=0) or totally asymmetric (q=1). However, from a psychological standpoint, there is comfort in being more informed, even if excess utility is non-existent.We plot the surface of the excess utility over the proportion of mispricing,q2and the volatility,σfor the Kou (2002) Jump-Diffusion model with Lévy density given by Eq. (15). We useκ=10per year,1/κ+=2%,1/κ-=4%,pu=0.3,T=1year in Fig. 1. The computed value ofM2=0.0225in this case. Observe that we have maximum excess utility when mispricing is at 75% (i.e.q2=34). Excess utility increases at a decreasing rate with mispricing up to 75% and decreases thereafter at faster rates. It also increases with the diffusive component of the overall variance of the asset process when jump exists. However, if there are no jumps in asset price (i.e.M2=0), then the excess utility is surprisingly independent of the overall variance of the asset price process. Thus, our results also show that the overall variance of the asset price process becomes more important for investors when jumps exist in the asset market.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We studied how asymmetric information, fads and Lévy jumps in the price of an asset affect the optimal portfolio strategies and maximum expected utilities of informed and uninformed investors in a financial asset market, and derived some explicit and informative results about the optimal portfolios and expected logarithmic utilities of each investor. Moreover, our study analytically enhances the extant literature on the fads models for asset under asymmetric information.Under quadratic approximation of the portfolios, we show that excess assets are held by an investor if and only if the ratio of the first and second instantaneous centralized moments of return is greater than the Merton optimal portfolio of that investor. We also show that jumps reduce the excess long run utility for the informed investor relative to that of the uninformed investor, which implies that jump risk may be good for market efficiency as an indirect reducer of information asymmetry. In the presence of asymmetric information, mispricing and jumps, our model shows that it pays to be more informed in the long run, but the excess utility of the informed investor is less than that obtained in the purely continuous GBM market. However, if there is no mispricing (or too much mispricing), the informed investor has no utility advantage. Our results also suggest that investors should pay more attention to the overall variance of the asset process when jumps exist in the financial asset market.
