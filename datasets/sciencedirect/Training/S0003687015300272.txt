Two-handed grip on a mobile phone affords greater thumb motor performance, decreased variability, and a more extended thumb posture than a one-handed grip

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Thumb tapping performance is greater for a two-compared to a one-handed grip.Tapping with a two-handed grip involved different wrist and thumb postures compared to a one-handed grip.Variability of the device's movement while tapping was more pronounced in a two compared to a one-handed grip.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Holding a mobile computing device with two hands may affect thumb motor performance, joint postures, and device stability compared to holding the device and tapping the touchscreen with the thumb of the holding hand. We tested the hypotheses that holding a touchscreen mobile phone with two hands lead to increased thumb motor performance, different thumb postures, and decreased device movement relative to using one hand. Ten right-handed participants completed reciprocal thumb tapping tasks between emulated keys on a smartphone in either a one- (portrait) or two-handed (landscape) grip configuration. Effective index of performance measured from Fitts' Law was 9% greater (p < 0.001), movement time 7% faster (p < 0.001), and taps were 4% more precise (p < 0.016) for the two-handed grip. Tapping with a two-handed grip involved significantly different wrist and thumb postures than a one-handed grip. Variability of the computing device's movement was 36–63% lower for the two-handed grip compared to the one-handed grip condition (p < 0.001). The support for our hypotheses suggests that a two-handed grip results in increased performance and more extended wrist and thumb postures than a single-handed grip. Device designs that allow two-handed grips may afford increased performance relative to a one-handed grip.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recent surveys estimate that 45% of Americans own a smartphone (Duggan and Rainie, 2012), and that users spend an average of 4.7 h/day using hand-held mobile device(s) (Berolo et al., 2011). Several postures are commonly selected to interact with mobile devices, with over half of users preferring to use their thumbs (Gold et al., 2012). However, little is known about the effect of different interaction techniques on performance and posture.Previous studies reporting thumb posture, thumb performance, and muscle activity during mobile device use have revealed that device design could affect both user performance and musculoskeletal strain (Jonsson et al., 2007, 2011; Karlson et al., 2008; Gustafsson et al., 2010; Hogg, 2010; Trudeau et al., 2012b). For right-handed users, tapping on the top right or bottom left of a touchscreen was associated with the greatest performance compared with other areas on the screen, as indicated by shorter transition times, better accuracy and fewer errors (Park and Han, 2010a, 2010b). Greater performance is associated with postures involving moderate thumb flexion or extension (Trudeau et al., 2012b), and small devices (Trudeau et al., 2012a).The grip that a user selects could affect motor performance and musculoskeletal strain (Gustafsson et al., 2011). Performance and strain could be related to hand size relative to the device, comfort, multitasking needs, accuracy requirements, need for support, or maintaining stability. Simultaneously supporting a device and tapping on its touchscreen using a single hand may be more difficult than using a two-handed grip, where task requirements can be shared. For example, if the thumb is involved in device stability but is also used to tap, then these two functions may conflict, therefore decreasing performance. Moreover, a single-handed grip may constrain thumb movement and require sub-optimal postures. Potentially for these reasons, Gustafsson et al. (2011) found that 62% of participants held mobile phones using a two-handed grip that involved less extensor digitorum muscle activity than a single-handed grip. However, whether the preference for a two-handed grip reflects a choice based on motor performance, posture, device stability, or other factors is unknown.The purpose of this study was to determine if holding a mobile phone-sized computing device with one or two hands affects thumb function during tapping tasks. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that a two-handed grip leads to increased thumb motor performance, different thumb joint postures, and decreased device movement relative to a one-handed grip.
