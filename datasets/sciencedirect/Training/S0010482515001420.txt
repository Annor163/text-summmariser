@&#ABSTRACT@&#
IntroductionSolar cheilosis (SC), a common precancer of the lower lip with a high potential to progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, presents with characteristic morphological vermillion-skin border alterations, like the border retraction.AimTo determine robust macro-morphological descriptors of the vermillion border from non-standardized digital photographs and to exploit a probabilistic model for SC recognition in real clinical environments.MethodsLip borders of 150 individuals (75 SC patients, 75 non-SC controls) were quantified on the basis of the extent of vermillion retraction and the degree of border irregularity employing fractal features and type-P Fourier descriptors. Eight lip border quantifiers were evaluated in terms of their reliability and reproducibility. The probabilistic ‘diagnostic’ model was implemented using the relevance vector machine (RVM) algorithm.ResultsPicture acquisition contributes substantially to overall variability of lip border images; however, for the different lip descriptors 33% to 65% of border morphological variability is due to differences among individuals. Different camera operators or the use of cameras with different specifications did not affect significantly the extracted lip features. The proposed RVM probabilistic model yielded a high sensitivity and specificity of 94.6% and 96%, respectively.ConclusionWe explored the use of digital photography within the clinical routine setting to validate a probabilistic model for the assessment of lip conditions like SC. The proposed method opens new perspectives toward a cost effective, non-invasive monitoring of SC to support large scale epidemiological and interventional studies in different clinical environments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Solar cheilosis (SC) is a common condition that mainly affects the lower lip of elderly, chronically sun exposed individuals. It is considered an in situ carcinoma equivalent to actinic keratoses of the skin [1,2]. However, the likelihood that precancer will progress into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a SC affected lip is about 2.5 fold higher than that for a comparable skin area with actinic keratoses [2,3]. Consequently the development of SC more than doubles the SCC risk of an individual [2,4]. Moreover, lower lip localization is considered as a distinct risk factor for recurrence or metastasis of SCC [5,6]. The predominant etiologic factor of SC is long term exposure to ambient sunlight ultraviolet radiation and for this reason it affects almost exclusively the stronger exposed lower lip (95% of the cases) [2,7,8]. Since as a rule SCC develops many years after the diagnosis of SC the current consensus for the prevention of lip SCC is timely treatment of all patients with SC and structured follow-up to monitor for disease recurrences [4,9]. However, all currently recommended therapeutic modalities for SC are associated with substantial discomfort and morbidity as they inflict significant symptoms (primarily pain in the highly innervated lower lip), while abrasive surfaces that result from treatment interfere with the daily intake of food and water for weeks. Thus development of objective measures that would assist appropriate patient selection who need treatment is pivotal for improving healthcare in this subset of patients. Currently the evaluation of SC severity is primarily subjective based on clinical criteria as are alterations of the configuration of lower lip vermillion-skin border [4,10] and variations of color, consistency or keratinization of the lower lip surface as well as relapsing fissuring. Histopathological evaluation offers insight of the presence and severity of the condition at tissue, yet, as SC involves the entire lower lip at various degrees of severity, it is only representative of the biopsy site [5,11]. Persistent erosions or ulcers usually denote the development of SCC [2]. A reliable, objective evaluation of lip alterations would significantly contribute in the identification and monitoring of disease progression and treatment outcome.In a recent publication, utilizing digital photography and image analysis techniques we introduced a workable methodology for accurate vermillion border detection and we applied it to monitor SC improvement after treatment with immunocryosurgery [12]. We presently expand this approach by exploiting the application of additional, robust lip border descriptors that provide both, adequate agreement with our visual perception of the irregularity of the lip boundary and sufficient ability to discriminate between lip boundaries with different degrees of abnormality.In addition, the dichotomous classification approach to discriminate healthy from SC diseased lips, presented in our previous study [12], is now expanded to assess the degree of lip abnormality by incorporating a probabilistic model approach based on relevance vector machine (RVM). The Bayesian framework of RVM formulation constitutes an attractive discriminative model alternative, since it permits the prediction of the posterior probability of abnormal lip configurations which is essential in treatment evaluation and patient monitoring. RVM have been used with success in different bio-medical application fields, such as, neonate pain intensity assessment [13], epilepsy diagnosis [14], gene selection in cancer classification [15], identification of functionally significant promoter sequences by microarray data analysis [16], detection of micro-calcifications in mammograms [17], and the diagnosis of glaucoma [18].From a clinical point of view, the proposed methodology is adequately efficient with respect to time and resource sparing as it did not require any specific equipment (e.g. chin holders or customized cameras). However, to establish the applicability of the proposed approach we need to safeguard for sufficient reliability and reproducibility of the evaluated macro-morphological lip border markers. Reliability is inherently flowed by different face postures taken by the subject, while practical problems that may interfere with the reproducibility of lip feature evaluation, include the use of dissimilar cameras with variable specifications or even different operators (different dermatologists). These confounding parameters have been herein addressed in order to make the suggested automated approach to the identification and quantification of SC suitable for large scale epidemiological studies in different clinical settings.
