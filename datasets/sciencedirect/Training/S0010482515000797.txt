@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown to reduce mortality in patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation) [1]. Current risk stratification for primary prevention ICD implantation is based primarily on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the presence of heart failure symptoms [2], but these factors have limited discriminatory value [3], and ICD implantation is not without risk [4]. It is therefore important to develop new, clinically meaningful, and mechanistically sound markers for an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, to allow identification of those individuals who would most benefit from prophylactic ICD implantation.VT can, in theory, be cured by catheter based radiofrequency ablation. Successful VT ablation can improve survival and quality of life, minimize or even eliminate the need for ICD therapies and/or toxic antiarrhythmic drugs [5,6], and decrease rates of heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. However, VT can recur after a successful ablation, even if aggressive ventricular stimulation is unable to re-induce VT at the end of the procedure [7]. Further improvement in detection and characterization of the electrophysiological (EP) substrate of VT is needed for accurate risk stratification of patients at risk of VT, and for development of an objective end-point of VT ablation. In this manuscript, we present a novel method for detection and quantification of an abnormal EP substrate.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We present a novel method of assessing EP substrate by measuring speed, curvature, orbital frequency, and planarity of filtered, three-dimensional VCG loops. Normal ventricular conduction is characterized by movement of the heart vector through a nearly single plane across all frequencies, maximum QRS loop speed mid-QRS, and an inverse relationship between QRS loop speed and curvature.Ventricular conduction in post-MI patients with MMVT is characterized by remarkably slower speed than in healthy participants, the presence of a relatively slow conduction in the middle of the QRS complex, rotation of filtered QRS loops through numerous planes resulting in a spherical “cloud” of filtered QRS loops, a direct relationship between speed and curvature, low orbital frequency, and prominent beat-to-beat heterogeneity of ventricular conduction at filtering frequencies ≥20Hz. Analysis of the speed, curvature, orbital frequency, and planarity of filtered QRS VCG loops permits characterization of ventricular conduction which is inapparent on the surface ECG. Further study of the IVC method is needed to determine its value as a risk stratification tool for VT and SCD, and as an objective end-point to determine the “success” of VT ablation.
