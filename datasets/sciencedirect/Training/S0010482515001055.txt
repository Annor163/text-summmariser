Gait accelerometry is an important approach for gait assessment. Previous contributions have adopted various pre-processing approaches for gait accelerometry signals, but none have thoroughly investigated the effects of such pre-processing operations on the obtained results. Therefore, this paper investigated the influence of pre-processing operations on signal features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. These signals were collected from 35 participants aged over 65years: 14 of them were healthy controls (HC), 10 had Parkinson׳s disease (PD) and 11 had peripheral neuropathy (PN). The participants walked on a treadmill at preferred speed. Signal features in time, frequency and time–frequency domains were computed for both raw and pre-processed signals. The pre-processing stage consisted of applying tilt correction and denoising operations to acquired signals. We first examined the effects of these operations separately, followed by the investigation of their joint effects. Several important observations were made based on the obtained results. First, the denoising operation alone had almost no effects in comparison to the trends observed in the raw data. Second, the tilt correction affected the reported results to a certain degree, which could lead to a better discrimination between groups. Third, the combination of the two pre-processing operations yielded similar trends as the tilt correction alone. These results indicated that while gait accelerometry is a valuable approach for the gait assessment, one has to carefully adopt any pre-processing steps as they alter the observed findings.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Maintaining balance is a challenging activity for the human body, which is an unstable system if not continuously controlled [1], and an increased impairment of the balance control system corresponds to an increase of gait impairments [2,3]. This highlights the need for clinicians to assess patients׳ gait. Clinicians attempt to accurately describe the health state of a patient via gait analysis in order to diagnose a gait disorder or to decide on a treatment that may improve patients׳ gait [4,5]. When dealing with elderly patients, the assessment of balance while standing and walking has proved to be a predictor of falls [6] and is related to self-rated health status [7], cognitive impairment caused by dementia [8,9], mortality and morbidity [10,11].Over the years, several approaches have been employed to assess gait. In particular, previous publications have utilized various measurements systems for gait assessment such as camera systems (e.g., [12,13]), body-mounted accelerometers (e.g., [14–22]), force platforms (e.g., [1,13,23]) and gyroscopes (e.g., [24–26]). Force platforms and cameras have the advantage of providing a fixed frame of reference whereas body-mounted systems enable subjects to cover longer distances [14].Gait accelerometry has become a widely adopted approach [27] due to its reliability, high precision and affordability [28]. It also enables computing a wide range of metrics to evaluate gait [29,30,27,31]. Pre-processing of gait-accelerometry signals may be necessary to remove noise or minimize the effect of gravity [14]. In previous publications it has been argued that a correction of the acceleration measurement is necessary due to the spine lordosis in the L3 region, the imprecise positioning of the accelerometer, and the effect of the gravity component over the measured accelerations [14]. Previous contributions also noticed that gait accelerometry signals can be noisy, and some denoising pre-processing may be needed in order to be able to extract gait features (e.g., [32,33]). However, pre-processing can have unintended consequences such as determining potential group differences when they do not exist. It is therefore logical to question the impact of pre-processing on the extracted gait features.A multitude of processes can be applied to the acquired signals. In this study, we applied two pre-processing operations used in gait analysis (e.g., [14,31–35]): tilt correction and wavelet denoising. As these are commonly applied pre-processing operations on gait accelerometry signals, the purpose of this paper was to understand their influence on signal features calculated in time, frequency and time–frequency domains using signals from different populations in order to understand whether pre-processing operations have detrimental effects on our ability to discriminate amongst pathological groups. We first extracted features from the raw signals. Then, we examined the effects of tilt correction on the extracted features, followed by the effects of denoising on the extracted features. Lastly, we examined the effects of joint pre-processing, i.e., we applied both operations (correction and denoising) to the raw data. However, to understand whether the order of operations plays a significant role, we examined these effects using a two-step approach. In the first step, we corrected data followed by the denoising operation. In the second step, we denoised the data initially, followed by the correction operation.Additionally, we explored whether the pre-processing operations affected the calculated acceleration features differently in individuals with and without expected gait abnormalities by examining individuals with Parkinson׳s disease (PD), peripheral neuropathy (PN) and healthy older adults. The possible presence of tremor, rigidity, and spinal inflexibility [36] in PD may impact both the position of the accelerometer and signal quality. Similarly, persons with PN typically walk with a wider base of support [37], which also may impact accelerometer recordings. Thus, pre-processing operations may have a greater impact on the values of the extracted acceleration features for these clinical groups. As use of acceleration-based outcomes measures is gaining grounds in rehabilitation randomized controlled trials, it is imperative that the signal processing methodology becomes standardized, otherwise it will become difficult to comparatively analyze the results of different trials.The major contribution of this paper is our finding that pre-processing has an impact on extracted gait accelerometry features especially after the application of tilt correction. It was important to understand whether pre-processing schemes have detrimental effects on our ability to gain discrimination across pathological groups, as no previous contribution has ever examined the effects of pre-processing operations on features extracted from gait accelerometry signals. However, we need to point out that the manuscript focuses on two commonly used pre-processing schemes for gait accelerometry signals, and it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript to comprehensively analyze all pre-processing approaches typically found in other areas.
