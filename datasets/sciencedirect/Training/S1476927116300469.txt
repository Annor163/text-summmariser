@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Protein structure prediction is considered as one of the most challenging and computationally intractable combinatorial problem. Thus, the efficient modeling of convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more importantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address this problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides limited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its astronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model widens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because of its finite set of data-points. In this work, we took the full advantage of an on-lattice model by using a face-centered-cube lattice that has the highest packing density with the maximum degree of freedom. We proposed a graded energy—strategically mixes the Miyazawa–Jernigan (MJ) energy with the hydrophobic-polar (HP) energy—based genetic algorithm (GA) for conformational search. In our application, we introduced a 2×2 HP energy guided macro-mutation operator within the GA to explore the best possible local changes exhaustively. Conversely, the 20×20 MJ energy model—the ultimate objective function of our GA that needs to be minimized—considers the impacts amongst the 20 different amino acids and allow searching the globally acceptable conformations. On a set of benchmark proteins, our proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the free energy levels and the root-mean-square deviations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Protein folding, by which the primary protein chain with amino acid residue sequence folds into its characteristics and functional three-dimensional (3D) structure in nature, is yet a very complex physical process to simulate (Morowitz, 1968; Stouthamer, 1973; Alberts et al., 2002). Once the folded 3D shape is available, it enables protein to perform specific tasks for living organisms. Conversely, misfolded proteins are responsible for various fatal diseases, such as prion disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cancer (Smith, 2003; Dobson, 2003). Because of these, protein structure prediction (PSP) problem has emerged as a very important research problem.Homology modeling, threading and ab initio are the broad categories of available computational approaches. However, while homologous template is not available, ab initio becomes the only computation approach, which aims to find the three dimensional structure of a protein from its primary amino acid sequence alone such that the total interaction energy among the amino acids is minimized.Ab initio computational approach for PSP is a daunting task (Dodson, 2007) and for modeling the structure on a realistic continuum space such as off-lattice space is even more daunting. However, there are several existing off-lattice models such as Rosetta (Kaufmann et al., 2010), Quark (Xu and Zhang, 2012), I-TASSER (Lee et al., 2009), and so on which map the structures on the realistic continuum spaces rather than using discretized on-lattice spaces and hence, those approaches need to deal with the astronomical data-points incurring heavy computational cost. On-lattice model on the other hand, (i) due to reduced complexity helps fast algorithms developments and (ii) widens the scope as well as permits relatively longer protein chains to examine, which is otherwise prohibitive (Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1985; Berrera et al., 2003; Lau and Dill, 1989; Cooper et al., 2010; Das and Baker, 2008; Wroe et al., 2005). The computed on-lattice fold can be translated to off-lattice space via hierarchical approaches to provide output in real-space (Hoque et al., 2005, 2010, 2011; Iqbal et al., 2015). The Monte Carlo (MC) or, Conformational Space Annealing (CSA) used in Rosetta can be replaced with better algorithm developed using on-lattice models (Hoque et al., 2005, 2010, 2011). For instance, we embedded one of our previous on-lattice algorithm (Hoque et al., 2011) within Rosetta and the embedded algorithm improved (Higgs et al., 2012a) the average RMSD by 9.5% and average TM-Score by 17.36% over the core Rosetta (Kaufmann et al., 2010). Similarly, the embedded algorithm also outperformed (Higgs et al., 2012a) I-TASSER (Lee et al., 2009). These improvements motivated us further developing superior algorithms using on-lattice models.The two most important building blocks of an ab initio PSP are (i) an accurate (computable) energy function (Iqbal et al., 2015) and (ii) an effective search or sampling algorithm. For a simplified model based PSP, it is possible to compute the lower bound (Giaquinta and Pozzi, 2013). It is also possible to know what would be the best score and hence the native score of a sequence by exhaustive enumeration (Unger and Moult, 1993a; Lesh et al., 2003) (which is feasible to compute for smaller sequences only). Even though, there exists no efficient sampling algorithm yet that can conveniently obtain the known final structure starting from a random structure for all possible available cases (Hoque et al., 2005, 2007a). Therefore, a number of efforts are being made, such as, different types of meta-heuristics have been used in solving the on lattice PSP problems. These include Monte Carlo Simulation (Thachuk et al., 2007), Simulated Annealing (Tantar et al., 2008), Genetic Algorithms (GA) (Hoque et al., 2005, 2007a; Unger and Moult, 1993b; Hoque, 2008), Tabu Search with GA (Böckenhauer et al., 2008), GA with twin-removal operator (Hoque et al., 2011), Tabu Search with Hill Climbing (Klau et al., 2002), Ant Colony Optimization (Blum, 2005), Particle Swarm Optimization (Kondov and Berlich, 2011; Mansour et al., 2012), Immune Algorithms (Cutello et al., 2007), Tabu-based Stochastic Local Search (Cebrián et al., 2008; Shatabda et al., 2012), Firefly Algorithm (Maher et al., 2014), and Constraint Programming (Mann et al., 2008; Dotú et al., 2011).Krasnogor et al. (2002) applied HP model for PSP problem using the square, triangular, and diamond lattices and further extended their work applying fuzzy-logic (Pelta and Krasnogor, 2005). Islam et al. further improved the performance of memetic algorithms in a series of work (Islam, 2011; Islam and Chetty, 2009; Islam et al., 2011c,a) for the simplified PSP models. They also proposed a clustered architecture for the memetic algorithm with a scalable niching technique (Islam and Chetty, 2010, 2013; Islam et al., 2011b) for PSP. However, using 3D FCC lattice points, the recent state-of-the-art results for the HP energy model have been achieved by genetic algorithms (Rashid et al., 2012a; Shatabda et al., 2013b), local search approaches (Shatabda et al., 2012; Rashid et al., 2013c), a local search embedded GA (Rashid et al., 2013a), and a multi-point parallel local search approach (Rashid et al., 2013b). Kern and Liao (2013) applied hydrophobic-core guided genetic operator for efficient searching on HP, HPNX and hHPNX lattice models. Several approaches towards the 20×20 energy model include a constraint programming technique used in Dal Palù et al. (2004, 2005) by to predict tertiary structures of real proteins using secondary structure information, a fragment assembly method (Dal Palù et al., 2011) to optimize protein structures. Among other successful approaches, a population based local search (Kapsokalivas et al., 2009) and a population based genetic algorithm (Torres et al., 2007) are found in the literature that applied empirical energy functions.In a hybrid approach, Ullah and Steinhöfel (2010) applied a constraint programming based large neighborhood search technique on top of the output of COLA (Dal Palù et al., 2007) solver. The hybrid approach produced the state-of-the-art results for several small sized (less than 75 amino acids) benchmark proteins. In another work, Ullah et al. (2009) proposed a two stage optimization approach combining constraint programming and local search using Berrera et al. (Berrera et al., 2003) deduced 20×20 energy matrix (we denote this model as BM). In a recent work, Shatabda et al. (2013a) presented a mixed heuristic local search algorithm for PSP and produced the state-of-the-art results using the BM model on 3D FCC lattice. Although the heuristics themselves are weaker than the BM energy model, their collective use in the random mixing fashion produce results better than the BM energy itself. In a previous work (Rashid et al., 2013d), we applied BM and HP energy models in a mixed manner within a GA framework and showed that hybridizing energies performs better than their individual performances.In this work, we propose a graded as well as hybrid energy function with a genetic algorithm (GA) based sampling to develop an effective ab initio PSP tool. The graded energy-model strategically mixes 20×20 Miyazawa–Jernigan (MJ) contact-energy (Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1985; Berrera et al., 2003) with the simple 2×2 hydrophobic-polar (HP) contact-energy model (Lau and Dill, 1989), denoted as MH (MJ+HP→MH) in this paper. Specifically, we propose a hydrophobic-polar categorization of the HP model within a hydrophobic-core directed macro-mutation operator to explore the local benefits exhaustively while the GA sampling is guided by the MJ energy Matrix globally. While the fine grained details of the high resolution interaction energy matrix can become computationally prohibit, a low resolution energy model may effectively sample the search-space towards certain promising directions particularly emphasizing on the pair-wise contributions with large magnitudes—which we have implementation strategically via a macro mutation. Further, we use an enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) framework (Rashid et al., 2012a) for protein structure optimization on 3D face-centered-cube (FCC) lattice model. Prediction in the FCC lattice model can yield the densest protein core (Hoque et al., 2005) and the FCC lattice model can provide the maximum degree of freedom as well as the closest resemblance to the real or, high resolution folding within the lattice constraint. FCC orientation can therefore align a real protein into the closest conformation amongst the available lattice configurations (Hoque et al., 2007a).On a set of standard benchmark proteins, our MH model guided GA, named as MH_GeneticAlgorithm (MH_GA), shows significant improvements in terms of interaction energies and root-mean-square deviations in comparison to the state-of-the-art search approaches (Ullah and Steinhöfel, 2010; Shatabda et al., 2013a; Torres et al., 2007) for the lattice based PSP models. For a fair comparison, we run Ullah and Steinhöfel (2010) and Shatabda et al. (2013a) using MJ energy model and in the result section, we compare our experimental results with the results produced by Ullah and Steinhöfel (2010) and Shatabda et al. (2013a). Further, we present an experimental analysis showing the effectiveness of using the hydrophobic polar categorization of the HP model to direct macro-mutation operation.
