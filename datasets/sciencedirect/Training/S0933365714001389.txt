ObjectivesAccess to the world wide web and multimedia content is an important aspect of life. We present a web browser and a multimedia user interface adapted for control with a brain-computer interface (BCI) which can be used by severely motor impaired persons.MethodsThe web browser dynamically determines the most efficient P300 BCI matrix size to select the links on the current website. This enables control of the web browser with fewer commands and smaller matrices. The multimedia player was based on an existing software. Both applications were evaluated with a sample of ten healthy participants and three end-users. All participants used a visual P300 BCI with face-stimuli for control.ResultsThe healthy participants completed the multimedia player task with 90% accuracy and the web browsing task with 85% accuracy. The end-users completed the tasks with 62% and 58% accuracy. All healthy participants and two out of three end-users reported that they felt to be in control of the system.ConclusionsIn this study we presented a multimedia application and an efficient web browser implemented for control with a BCI.SignificanceBoth applications provide access to important areas of modern information retrieval and entertainment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The idea that brain signals can be used to control external devices or computers was proposed in [1]. As most brain-computer interface (BCI) systems today, the design was based on fluctuations of electrical potential recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) [2]. Various phenomena can be used to control BCIs such as slow cortical potentials (SCPs), the sensorimotor-rhythm (SMR) and event-related potentials (ERPs) [3–5]. Many applications have been developed for BCIs. For instance the SMR can be used to control prosthetic devices for rehabilitative or restorative purposes [6]. BCIs used for communication are continuously being adapted to improve usability and communication speed for people with motor or even visual impairments by using different stimulation techniques or improving the software used for communication [7–11]. Additionally, new insights contribute to the models behind BCI control and how usage and training can be improved [12–16].Ultimately, much of the research conducted with BCIs is focused on providing communication methods for people with severe motor impairments preventing the use of assistive devices that require control of muscles [17]. Much of this research has focused on the BCI paradigm that uses visually elicited P300 ERPs [5]. In this paradigm the possible commands (usually letters for communication) are displayed in a matrix on a screen in front of the user. The rows and columns are then highlighted using an unpredictable sequence. When the user focuses on an element of the matrix a P300 and other ERPs components are elicited whenever this row or column is highlighted. This response can be detected online and is used for selection. Several repetitions are needed to achieve a sufficient signal to noise ratio. Highlighting was up until recently performed by increasing the brightness of the row or column but it has now been shown that stimuli such as faces are much more efficient at eliciting ERPs due to their higher psychological salience [18]. The pattern with which the stimulation is performed can also be improved by lifting the row and column restriction [19] or using different colours for stimulation [20].Various neurodegenerative diseases and injuries can lead to degrees of motor impairment at which the use of a BCI can provide an improvement in quality of life by restoring communication. These degrees of impairment are termed the locked-in state (LIS), in which only rudimentary muscle control (over e.g. the eye muscles) remains, and the complete locked-in state (CLIS) in which no control and thus no communication or control possibilities remain [21]. People with such severe disabilities would benefit from improvement in areas of manipulation, communication, computer access/entertainment, and environmental control [22,23]. BCIs have been proposed for many of these areas. Mostly SMR based BCIs have been used to control robotic arms or neuroprostheses [24–27]. Communication applications have been implemented using visual and auditory ERPs and motor potentials [28–32]. For a review see [33]. In the area of entertainment BCIs can provide methods of artistic expression and gaming [34–38]. Finally, BCIs can also be adapted to control smart homes [39,40].In this paper we focused on a particular aspect of modern communication, namely the use of information technology such as web browsing [41]. The first BCI controlled web browsers were operated using SCPs. Initial versions of this browser were restricted to fixed links that were selected from a list but the browser was later extended to enable free navigation [42,43]. Besides needing a substantial amount of training SCP BCIs can be used for binary choices only. Thus with many links on the website a large number of selections is needed for a single link. Due to the higher efficiency of selecting one of multiple commands a P300 controlled web browser was created [44]. Each link on a webpage was assigned a letter (termed a “hint”) or several letters (if more than 26 links were on the page). This resulted in the requirement of very large matrices (8 rows and columns) and thus increased selection times (because each row and column needed to be flashed). Additionally, when filling out forms or writing text in general the matrix needed to be changed by the user requiring an additional selection. An alternative implementation of a P300 web browser displayed the flashes directly over the link on the web page [45]. This reduces the necessity of shifting the gaze from the screen displaying the matrix to the screen displaying the browser. Displaying the stimuli on the links does not resolve the need for an additional matrix for text entry and also introduces other visibility issues if links cluster together. It is also more complicated to use alternative visual stimuli such as faces. An alternative utilises a P300 BCI controlled mouse that automatically snaps to possible selections on websites [46].In addition to accessing information it can be desirable to be able to manage and view local media files such as videos and photographs using multimedia applications. Control of media players is often mentioned or used with small samples in BCI studies [47–49]. But an extensive evaluation of a media player system is missing from the literature. Displaying photographs, watching movies and listening to music is an important part of modern entertainment and general media consumption.In this publication it was our goal to address the shortcoming of current P300 BCI browsers of displaying superfluous elements in the P300 matrix used for control. We thus implemented a dynamic protocol that generated the P300 matrix from the relevant elements on the website online. Thus only the options needed by the user were included in the P300 matrix. In this paper we present the evaluation of the dynamic matrix generation with healthy participants and participants with motor disabilities. In addition to information retrieval, we wanted to enable users to independently consume media content. Thus, we also integrated control of a multimedia software.
