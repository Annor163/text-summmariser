@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In C2C communication, all necessary information must be collected promptly when a buyer and a seller communicate. That is, an intelligent C2C agent is needed to provide information to buyers and sellers. Along with the evolution of computing technology, C2C agents can exploit the efficient delivery capabilities of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. However, P2P also increases traffic between agents, but communication faults are a fatal problem for C2C business. This study proposes a robust communication architecture based on current P2P content-delivery standards and its efficiency and robustness have been verified from an experiment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
E-commerce involves the trade of products or services over networking systems. Electronic trade has grown exponentially as communication technology has spread [7]. Especially in the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) market, buyers and sellers communicate increasingly frequently as networking technology improves [7]. The C2C market refers to business transactions between consumers conducted through a networking platform [19]. For example, online auctions are a typical C2C business, and allow users to employ C2C platforms to act as either sellers or buyers. However, such platforms are not free. Generally, the networking services provided for C2C users are based on charging a flat fee or commission to sellers or buyers.C2C platforms allow users to extend their reach in terms of communicating with buyers or sellers. Such are convenient but users are concerned with the associated charges [32]. C2C platform providers charge users fees that increase with increasing communication frequency. That is, for users, it is important to discuss how to use C2C platform that involves cost-benefits. Additionally, the evolution of computing technology is increasing the frequency of communications via C2C [26]. Buyers can analyze goods of interest from the perspectives of price, discount and appendages numerous times before completing a transaction. That is, buyers like to analyze all collected information, including text, picture, movie, and animation files, before making a decision. Notably, sellers also want to analyze information regarding goods offered for sale to improve sales. However, frequent communications are time consuming and costly. Therefore, time and money can be saved if users collect all required information before communication. An automatic mechanism thus is required to help users understand required information.The intelligent agent can be adopted to release user efforts to analyze information. Intelligent agents enable users to obtain useful information in a timely manner [3,6,16]. However, while intelligent agents can analyze information, considering efficient methods of data collection is important. Restated, speed and convenience are important for agent communication [5,6]. Currently, the high efficiency of the peer-to-peer (P2P) application makes it a good means of collecting information [8]. P2P allows all data related to goods to be duplicated among peers automatically. That is, when a peer requires data on a good, that information can be retrieved from nearby peers rather than searching the whole network. However, such a P2P environment causes heavy network traffic, because of continuous data duplication. It may stop applications and consume resources heavily issued by C2C platform providers owing to network congestion [6,17]. Therefore the agent application based on P2P standards is insufficient, and the P2P protocol must be modified to balance efficiency and robustness.This study proposes a robust communication architecture of the C2C intelligent agent named C2CIA. The C2CIA architecture can assure efficient and robust communication between agents. C2CIA allows C2C users to extend their reach in terms of communicating with buyers or sellers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the architecture of the intelligent agent. Section 3 then describes the conceptual architecture of C2CIA. Next, Section 4 illustrates the correctness of C2CIA communication. Subsequently, Section 4 presents the performance evaluation of C2CIA communication. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions.
