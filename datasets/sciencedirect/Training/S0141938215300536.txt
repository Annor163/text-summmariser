@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The MoO3 doped N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB:MoO3 in 2:1 mass ratio) and 4,4′-N,N′-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP:MoO3 in 2:1 mass ratio) as p-doped hole transport layers have been used in inverted organic light emitting diodes (IOLEDs). Compared to the NPB/20nm NPB:MoO3 structure, the NPB/10nm CBP:MoO3/10nm NPB:MoO3 structure showed increased device performance, mostly because the hole transport barrier from CBP:MoO3 to NPB was smaller than that from NPB:MoO3 to NPB; it also presented improved device performance than the NPB/20nm CBP:MoO3 structure, ascribed to the higher conductivity of NPB:MoO3 than that of CBP:MoO3. We provide a manageable way to unlock the merits of p-doped hole transport layers for markedly increasing the performance of IOLEDs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Inverted organic light emitting diodes (IOLEDs) have attracted much attention, due to their compatibility with n-channel amorphous silicon field-effect transistor, favoring the low-cost production of active-matrix flat-panel display [1–10]. However, in order to compete with the conventional liquid crystal display, the active-matrix OLED display needs to be more efficient, stable, and cheaper. Thus, it is of an urgent need for OLEDs to reduce the power loss as much as possible, which has been considered as a fundamental issue for LEDs.The improvement of hole injection can contribute to the reduction in the power loss of OLEDs. During the past decade, p-doped hole transport layers (HTLs) have been widely used to enhance hole injection of OLEDs [11–13], since (1) the p-doped HTL can offer ohmic contacts with metal even with medium work function, e.g., Al, as a result of the thin depletion zone formed between p-doped HTL and metal, and (2) the p-doped HTL can lead to the significant decrease in ohmic loss during hole conduction relative to the undoped HTL. The MoO3 doped N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB:MoO3) and 4,4′-N,N′-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP:MoO3) are among the most frequently employed p-doped HTLs. As shown in Fig. 1, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels for NPB:MoO3 and CBP:MoO3 are −5.35 and −6.25eV; the work functions for NPB:MoO3 and CBP:MoO3 are 4.9 and 5.6eV [14,15], respectively.In conventional p-i-n OLEDs, a single p-doped HTL has been used. Despite achieving the remarkable device performance, the usage of a single p-doped HTL is currently stick in a dilemma that the hole conduction advantage of p-doped HTL is unavoidably counteracted by the hole transport barrier (ϕB) across the interface with the undoped HTL [16–18]. As of now, how to unlock the potential of p-doped HTLs remains still challenging in IOLEDs. In this paper, for the first time, the combination of two p-doped HTLs has been applied to improve the performance of IOLEDs, and the underlying mechanism was discussed.100nm-thick ITO thin film coated glass substrates were commercially bought with a sheet resistance of 10Ω per square. After being carefully cleaned in acetone, alcohol, and de-ionized water sequentially by an ultrasonic horn, the pre-patterned ITO substrates were blown dry by a nitrogen gun. The NPB, CBP, bathocuproine (BCP), and tris(8-quinolinolato) aluminum (Alq3) were obtained from Jilin OLED material Company; the MoO3 and Li2CO3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company, and applied as p- and n-typed dopants, respectively. The ratios of dopant to host were recorded in mass. All the materials were used as received.The base pressure of the device fabrication was 4×10−4Pa. The five IOLEDs were fabricated as follows:IOLED 1: ITO/4:1 BCP:Li2CO3 10nm/Alq3 40nm/NPB 60nm/2:1 NPB:MoO3 20nm/Al;IOLED 2: ITO/4:1 BCP:Li2CO3 10nm/Alq3 40nm/NPB 60nm/2:1 CBP:MoO3 20nm/Al;IOLED 3: ITO/4:1 BCP:Li2CO3 10nm/Alq3 40nm/NPB 60nm/2:1 CBP:MoO3 10nm/2:1 NPB:MoO3 10nm/Al;IOLED 4: ITO/4:1 BCP:Li2CO3 10nm/Alq3 40nm/NPB 60nm/2:1 CBP:MoO3 5nm/2:1 NPB:MoO3 15nm/Al;IOLED 5: ITO/4:1 BCP:Li2CO3 10nm/Alq3 40nm/NPB 60nm/2:1 CBP:MoO3 15nm/2:1 NPB:MoO3 5nm/Al.Note that, The 2:1 doping ratio of organic material to MoO3 was an optimized value [19,20]. It should be stressed that some part of MoO3 degraded into lower valance oxides in the vacuum deposition, but for simplifying the device expression, MoO3 was used as the nominal notation.The current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of the OLEDs were measured by the programmable Keithley 2400 sourcemeter, and the luminance was recorded by an ST-86LA Spot Photometer under the ambient condition.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The IOLEDs employing p-doped HTL play an important role in active-matrix flat-panel display, so it is of significance to improve their performance in practical ways. In this paper, the combined 10nm CBP:MoO3 and 10nm NPB:MoO3 showed improved hole current into the NPB and thereby the performance of IOLED, relative to the single 20nm CBP:MoO3 and 20nm NPB:MoO3. Hence, the combination of the two p-doped HTLs can be thought useful to unlock the merits of p-doped HTLs in the IOLEDs, much benefiting their advance toward the low-cost commercialization. The future work will focus on the power loss optimization of the phosphorescent IOLEDs via using this concept to enhance hole current into the 4,4′,4″-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-triphenylamine.
