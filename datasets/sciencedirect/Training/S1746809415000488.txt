@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to tibialis anterior (TA) has been proven as a useful intervention for gait rehabilitation. Because stimulation parameters in FES-assisted walking are associated with TA activation, the objective of this study was to characterize TA electromyography (EMG) among four terrains, including normal walking, obstacle crossing, and stairs ascending and descending. Six healthy subjects participated in the experiment and TA EMG, lower limb kinematic and kinetic data were recorded simultaneously when subjects were instructed to walk on the four terrains. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the time interval from the heel-off event to the onset timing of TA activation when stairs descending was compared with normal walking, obstacle crossing and stairs ascending (P<0.05). Significant differences in EMG duration between each pair of terrains were also found (P<0.05). The normalized peak EMG amplitude of stairs ascending was significantly larger than normal walking and stairs descending (P<0.05). When terrains changed, TA activation was altered by the central nervous system for a stable landing and a forward body movement. These results may provide evidence for terrain-adaptive parameters in FES-assisted walking to correct dropfoot.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Dropfoot is prevalent in gait impairment following stroke as a result of common peroneal nerve injury [1,2], leading to insufficient ankle dorsiflexion during swing phase [3] and toe contact at the early stance phase [4]. Compensations for dropfoot were often found in post-stroke patients, such as circumduction gait, foot clearance in the affected side, excessive hip flexion and earlier heel off in the contralateral side [5], which brought a high risk of stumble events [6]. Furthermore, greater metabolic costs have been found during abnormal gait than in normal walking [7].Terrain is an important factor affecting gait [8]. Obstacle crossing is a challenging task and more easily leads to a loss of balance for the elderly [9]. Compared with normal walking, greater force of lower extremity muscles and larger flexion angle of hip, knee and ankle joints are needed for dynamic stability [10]. Stairs ascending and descending are essential skills for independent ambulation, which are associated with high risks of serious injury, especially from stairs descending [11,12]. The body's center of mass (COM) has to be moved in both vertical and horizontal directions in coordination with lower limb joint motion, muscular strength and cardiovascular fitness [11]. Therefore, stairs ascending and descending are regarded as the most challenging tasks in elderly adults [13]. After stroke, muscle weakness and motor impairment in hemiplegic subjects has been attributed to a great loss of joint mobility and precise movement control while maintaining body balance [14]. Forster et al. [15] and Said et al. [14] have shown that post-stroke patients’ falls were primarily related to a loss of balance or contact with obstacles during gait. Therefore, stroke subjects had to apply additional compensation for muscle weakness and walking instability in different terrains, which were associated with increments of energy cost [16].For difficulties in locomotor tasks, rehabilitation training has been used for impaired treatment and is proven to be effective for lower limb motor recovery [17]. Teasell et al. [18] and Sheffler et al. [19] applied ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for treating dorsiflexion weakness. Compared with non-supportive devices, AFO was beneficial to hemiplegic ambulation during normal walking, obstacle crossing and stairs ascending and descending. However, the device only assisted in dropfoot correction, and the fixed mechanism resisted plantarflexion during late stance. Additionally, the plastic equipment had to be custom-designed and use subject-specified parameters to enhance comfort. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the tibialis anterior (TA) was first introduced to correct dropfoot in the 1960s [20]. Compared with AFO devices, FES was of a small size and light weight, which may be more portable for patients at home or outside on different terrains. In 2006, Sheffler et al. applied a commercial product (Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator, ODFS) with a footswitch controller to fourteen stroke participants [19]. The study included five terrains’ tasks of over ground walking, uneven surface walking, sit-to-stand, obstacle crossing and stairs ascending and descending for training and evaluation. However, stimulation parameters for onset timing, duration and intensity were not distinguished accurately between each task in practical application. Schillings et al. had proven that the amplitude of TA activation showed significant differences when obstacle crossing was compared with normal walking [21].FES was applied to TA for dropfoot correction, and TA electromyography (EMG) can also be used as a natural control source of FES, so TA has received widespread attention in gait research. Byrne et al. [22] and Chen et al. [23] had analyzed the TA EMG envelope at eleven walking speeds on the treadmill and four walking frequencies on the ground, respectively. Bovi et al. qualitatively analyzed lower limb kinematics, kinetics and muscle activation including TA in toe-walking, heel-walking and stairs ascending and descending [24]. Only EMG envelope profiles for different tasks were studied. Huang et al. [25] and Jin et al. [26] extracted the features of EMG signal from lower limb muscles for terrain identification, such as level-ground walking, obstacle crossing, stairs ascending, stairs descending, down slope and upslope. However, few studies have systematically investigated how terrains affect TA activation. The objective of this study was to characterize TA EMG among four terrains including normal walking, obstacle crossing, and stairs ascending and descending. The time interval from the heel-off event to the onset timing of TA activation was investigated. Moreover, terrain-induced changes on EMG duration and normalized peak EMG amplitude were also investigated, which were correlated with FES parameters including stimulation timing, duration and intensity. The results may provide evidence for the design of terrain-adaptive parameters in FES-assisted walking to correct dropfoot.
