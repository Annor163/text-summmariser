@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the vertical alignment phase of road design, one minimizes the cost of moving material between different sections of the road while maintaining safety and building code constraints. Existing vertical alignment models consider neither the side-slopes of the road nor the natural blocks like rivers, mountains, etc., in the construction area. The calculated cost without the side-slopes can have significant errors (more than 20 percent), and the earthwork schedule without considering the blocks is unrealistic. In this study, we present a novel mixed integer linear programming model for the vertical alignment problem that considers both of these issues. The numerical results show that the approximation of the side-slopes can generate solutions within an acceptable error margin specified by the user without increasing the time complexity significantly.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Road design, the question of how to build a new road from A to B, is surprisingly complicated. Given the infinite number of potential roads between any two points, it is obvious that enumerating ‘all potential options’ and then selecting the best is obviously impossible. What is less obvious, is that even given just two options, the question of evaluating each option for comparison is quite hard.A potential road is often viewed as a fixed horizontal alignment, i.e., a road trajectory from a satellite’s eye view. In order to evaluate the cost of the potential road, the road designer is required to look at the vertical ground profile along the horizontal alignment and select a vertical road profile. The road profile must respect various grade constraints and other road specifications, while simultaneously minimizing the cost of construction. Finding this vertical road profile is called the vertical alignment problem in road design (AASHTO, 2004; Jha et al., 2006). As the solution to the vertical alignment problem is used to evaluate a potential horizontal alignment, the ability to create an accurate optimal vertical alignment is a key step to determining a final road design. (Note that, the optimal vertical alignment alone is not sufficient to evaluate a horizontal alignment; other factors such as land acquisition costs and changes to traffic flow must be considered Angulo et al. 2014; Maji and Jha 2011.)The vertical alignment problem arises in a wide range of design road scenarios: from highways to mountain roads and from new roads to lane expansion. As such, it can be viewed as a highly important sub-problem in road design. Unlike horizontal alignment, vertical alignment optimization is a well-defined problem, which does not depend on non-mathematical factors like political issues. As such, it is studied comprehensively and several different modeling techniques can be found in the literature (see Section 1.1 ). In this study, we propose a new model to optimize the vertical alignment for a predetermined horizontal alignment.This new model advances the current state-of-the-art for vertical alignment in several ways, all of which are focused on increasing the accuracy of the vertical alignment problem. Working from Moreb (2009) and Koch and Lucet (2010), we extend the vertical alignment model to include blocks and side-slopes.Blocks are physical challenges, such as bridging a river or tunneling through a mountain, that must be overcome before earth movement can occur. It is known that, ‘optimal vertical alignments’ that do not properly implement blocks are unrealistic and therefore inaccurate (Hare et al., 2011). To incorporate blocks into vertical alignment we adapt the work of Hare et al. (2011).Side-slopes are the gradual slopes on the sides of the road required for stability. The existence of side-slopes implies that the amount of earthwork required is not linear in relation to the change in road height. Ignoring this within a vertical alignment model results in a noticeable error in the solution. To incorporate side-slopes into vertical alignment, we introduce approximation slabs (details appear in Section 2). Using real-life test problems, we find that modeling without side-slopes results in errors ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent.The overall result is a new model for the vertical alignment problem that is significantly more accurate than previous models. These results are applicable to any company working in road design, and in particular are implemented in our industrial partner’s road design software.Within this work we provide details on how the vertical alignment model was adapted to incorporate blocks and side-slopes (Sections 2 and 3). After providing some analysis of the new model (Section 4), we compare the model’s robustness and accuracy to previous methods (Section 5.2). Finally, we examine how the model behavior is affected by several of the design variables (Section 5.3). This provides insight on how to select appropriate values for these variables in practice. We end with some concluding remarks.Before detailing our model and solution techniques for vertical alignment, we provide a brief historical overview of the vertical alignment problem.The vertical alignment problem has been approached in several manners. Numerical search, dynamic programming, and mathematical programming are frequently applied approaches (Jha et al., 2006). One of the successful attempts using numerical search can be found in Goh and Teo (1988), in which the vertical alignment problem is formulated as a calculus of variations problem and then converted to an optimal control problem. The resulting model becomes a general constrained non-linear optimization problem that can be solved by known numerical search algorithms. Most dynamic programming attempts discretize the search space by horizontal and vertical grid lines, where each of the horizontal grid lines stands for a state, and each of the vertical grid lines represents a stage in the multi-stage decision process. The output of this formulation is the elevation along each vertical grid line. (A mixed-integer linear programming producing the same output can be found in Trypia (1979).) The studies by Goh et al. (1988),Fwa (1989), and Goktepe et al. (2005) are based on a similar concept with different improvements. A recent approach using dynamic programming (Goktepe et al., 2009) integrated the Weighted Ground Line Method (WGLM) of earthwork optimization with a dynamic programming model of vertical alignment. A numerical search cannot guarantee the global optimality for a complex model, and dynamic programing can miss a good solution because of the discretization process and the required post-processing steps.Mayer and Stark (1981) developed a linear programming model that minimizes the earth moving cost while balancing the earth quantities in any section. A similar model was developed by Nandgaonkar (1981). Oglesby and Hicks (1982) used a combination of a graphical method called the mass haul diagram and linear programming for earthwork optimization. Easa (1988) extended the model of Mayer and Stark (1981) and proposed a numerical search algorithm that looks for a feasible vertical alignment while optimizing earthwork operations by linear programming as a sub-routine. Easa (1987); 1988) considered nonconstant unit cost for material movement, and for linear unit costs he proposed a quadratic programming model (Easa, 1988) of the earthwork operation. Moreb and Bafail advanced these techniques and demonstrated they could be used to solve the land-leveling problem (a specific example of earthwork optimization) (Moreb and Bafail, 1994). Moreb (1996) further modeled the vertical alignment and earthwork operation in a single linear program. Both Easa’s model (Easa, 1988) and Moreb’s model (Moreb, 1996) give piecewise linear alignments. ReVelle et al. (1997) developed a model that approximated the road profile with a fifth order polynomial while using a linear program to find the optimal coefficients of the polynomial. Aljohani and Moreb (2003) gave a more flexible representation using polynomials of any degree. The problem of using a single polynomial is that the solution is highly dependent on its degree. Moreb and Aljohani (2004) found a quadratic spline representation of the road profile that minimizes earthwork cost using linear programming to avoid the shortcomings of the polynomial approach. Moreb (2009) further improved the model by adding some additional constraints that ensure smoothness at the connectivity of two spline pieces and generalized the technique with a piecewise polynomial of any degree. Koch and Lucet (2010) improved the accuracy of the spline model by changing two constraints and reported that only a linear or a quadratic spline could be used while maintaining the linear structure of the model. Hare et al. (2014) recently examined a variety of techniques to improve the speed of solving the vertical alignment problem. (For more information on these techniques we refer to Rahman (2012) and references therein.) The research in this paper focuses on improving the overall accuracy of the vertical alignment problem.Among the other recent models on the vertical alignment problem, Goktepe et al. (2009) proposed a genetic algorithm based on a constrained curve-fitting method, and Garber and Hoel (2009) used a greedy mass haul diagram based approach. A detailed survey about the research in this area can be found in Jha et al. (2006).Hao and Pan (2011) studied the accuracy of earthwork calculation based on triangulated information. Later, Cheng and Jiang (2013) compared the accuracy resulting from the 2D average-end-area method vs. 3D models. They confirmed the feasibility of the average-end-area method widely used in the literature when section lengths are less than 30 meters. Consequently, one does not have to resort to more computationally expensive models that track movements of each block of material (Burdett and Kozan, 2010; 2014) (blocks in these two articles refer to a volume of material while blocks in Koch and Lucet (2010); Hare et al. (2011) and the present article is to be understood as an obstacle).An example of vertical alignment is shown in Fig. 1, where the s-axis represents the station points, and the h-axis represents the elevations. Ground and road profiles are the states of the construction area before and after the road is constructed. The construction area is divided into smaller units called sections. The setS={1,2,…,n}holds the indices of all the sections. The road profile is represented by a quadratic spline. The setG={1,2,…,m}holds the indices of all the spline segments. For allg∈G,the equation for each spline segment is(2.1)Pg(x)=ag,1+ag,2x+ag,3x2.A spline segment spans one or more sections. If a spline segment g spans ngsections, then we define the setSg={1,2,…,ng}. Consequently,(2.2)n=∑g∈Gng.The starting station point of the ith section of the gth spline segment is denoted by sg, i, and the ending station point is denoted by sg, i + 1. So, by definitionsg,ng+1=sg+1,1,forallg∈G∖{m}.The function(2.3)ϰ:(G,Sg)→Smaps the section index in a spline segment to the absolute section index. The spline representing the road profile in Fig. 1has 5 segments, and each segment spans 10 sections. An example of the mapping function is ϰ(2, 1) = 11. Since the constructed road cannot be too steep, the slope of the spline segments must be bounded. For a spline segment g, Lgand Ugrepresent the lower and upper bounds of its slope. The setHconsists of pairs (s, H) such that the elevation of the road must be H at station point s, and the setH′consists of pairs(s,H′)such that the slope of the road must beH′at station point s. Normally,HandH′contain data for the start and end stations of the road.A section is called a cut (respectively fill), if the volume difference between the ground profile and the road profile at the section is positive (respectively negative). The net volume of a cut (respectively fill) is positive (respectively negative). Borrow pits are external sections from which earth can be borrowed, and waste pits are external sections to which earth can be dumped. Both borrow and waste pits incur a usage cost. By design, a borrow pit is always a cut, and a waste pit is always a fill. There are nbborrow pits, which are indexed by the setB={n+1,n+2,…,n+nb},nwwaste pits, which are indexed by the setW={n+nb+1,n+nb+2,…,n+nb+nw}. The function(2.4)ϑ:B→Smaps the borrow pit index to the section index to which it is attached and the function(2.5)φ:W→Smaps the waste pit index to the section index to which it is attached. The distance from a borrow or waste pit to the associated section is called the dead haul distance and is denoted byd˜iwherei∈B∪W. The capacity of the ith borrow pit (respectively waste pit) is denoted byCib(respectivelyCiw). The index setN=S∪B∪Wis defined to be the set of all the sections, borrow pits, and waste pits indices.Moving earth from a borrow pit to a waste pit introduces costs without any benefit and is not permitted.The setN^2consists of all pairs of indices (i, j) such that moving earth from section i to section j is permitted. The definition ofN^2is(2.6)N^2={(i,j):j∈S∪W,j≠iifi∈Sj∈Sifi∈B}.A block is an obstacle that needs to be dealt with before any earth can be moved over the location (Hare et al., 2011). There are nzblocks, which are indexed by the setI={1,2,…,nz}. The function(2.7)ς:I→Smaps the block index to the section index. The process is discretized into time-steps to deal with blocks. The setTcontains the indices of the time-steps, and the binary variable yktrepresents whether a blockk∈Iis present at time-step t (ykt= 0) or not (ykt= 1). It is ensured that at each time-step at least one block is removed, i.e., the number of time-steps is at most nz+ 1. An access road is defined as a road that gives access for earthwork to begin at any section to which it is attached. We assume that there is a borrow pit and a waste pit with infinite capacity attached with each access road. We need the following definitions,(2.8)Nbk={(i,j)∈N^2:blockkisbetweeniandj}(2.9)Nbk1,k2={i∈N:iisbetweenblocksk1andk2andthereisnoaccessroadbetweenblocksk1andk2}(2.10)Nb←,k={i∈N:iisbeforeblockkandthereisnoaccessroadbeforeblockk}(2.11)Nbk,→={i∈N:iisafterblockkandthereisnoaccessroadafterblockk}.The cost for cutting earth from a section is called the excavation cost, the cost for moving earth from a section to another section is called the hauling cost, and the cost for filling a section with earth is called the embankment cost. Fori∈N,the per unit volume excavation cost is pi, and the per unit volume embankment cost is qi. Fori,j∈N,the per unit volume hauling cost from i to j is cij. In order to retain the logical consistency in the problem, the cost must maintain strict triangular inequality, i.e., for alli,j,k∈N,i ≠ j, j ≠ k, and k ≠ i,(2.12)pi+cij+qj<(pi+cik+qk)+(pk+ckj+qj);see Hare et al. (2011) for the details.The decision variables are•Vi+(for alli∈S): excavated volume for a section,Vi−(for alli∈S): embanked volume for a section,xijt(for all(i,j)∈N2,t∈T): hauled volume from i to j at time-step t,ag, k(for allg∈G,k∈{1,2,3}): the coefficients of the quadratic spline,ui(for alli∈S): the elevation difference of the ground profile from the road profile for a section,ykt(for allt∈T,k∈I): the block removal indicators, andbi(for alli∈S): stockpiling variables.It should be noted that the lower and upper bounds for uiareuiandu¯irespectively, ui> 0 represents a cut, ui< 0 represents a fill, and ui= 0 represents a section that is neither cut nor fill. The maximum excavated volume isMi+and the maximum embanked volume isMi−for a section i. We define M to be(2.13)M=maxi∈S{Mi+,Mi−},and δ to be a very small positive number equal to the smallest possible positive excavated or embanked volume.The time-steps and blocks introduce an interesting phenomenon called stockpiling (Hare et al., 2011). Stockpiling is storing earth temporarily in a section until a block is removed and then moving the stored earth on the other side of the block. If the amount of stockpiling is not checked, then additional temporary blocks may be created. Stockpiling constraints in Hare et al. (2011) limit the amount of earth that can be stockpiled. However, the excavation cost of stockpiled earth is less than the excavation cost of a section, which is not considered in Hare et al. (2011). To avoid this source of error, this model assumes no stockpiling occurs. In terms of modeling, this assumption does not allow bothVi+andVi−to have a positive value for a section i, and the binary variables biensure that.Moreb (2009) does not consider the side-slopes of the roads when calculating the volume. Without the side-slopes the volume of a section i is a linear function of ui. But with side-slopes the cross-section of the road at a section is a trapezoid (see Figs. 2 and 3) and the volume becomes a quadratic function of ui, i.e., the linear structure of the model is violated. A similar issue was addressed by Easa (1988) and a quadratic programming model was proposed. However, in this research we maintain the linear structure of the model by approximating the cut volume of a section i withki+rectangular bars and the fill volume withki−rectangular bars. These rectangular bars are called slabs. One such approximation is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. For a cut i, the areas and heights of slabs areAikandu¯ikrespectively, wherek∈{1,2,…,ki+},and for a fill, they areBikandu̲ik,wherek∈{1,2,…,ki−}.The objective of this problem is to find the vertical alignment while minimizing the total excavation cost, embankment cost, and hauling cost. So, the objective function can be written as,(3.1)min∑i∈S(piVi++qiVi−)+∑i∈B∑j∈S∑t∈Tpixijt+∑i∈W∑j∈S∑t∈Tqixjit+∑(i,j)∈N^2∑t∈Tcijxijt.The first set of constraints are called the balance constraints: fori∈S,(3.2)∑t∈T∑j∈S∪Wxijt=Vi+and∑t∈T∑j∈S∪Bxjit=Vi−.The pit constraints define the capacity of the borrow and waste pits: for alli∈B∪W,(3.3)∑t∈T∑j∈Sxijt≤Cib(ifi∈B)and∑t∈T∑j∈Sxjit≤Ciw(ifi∈W).A few constraints are required to handle blocks in the model. From the definition of blocks, no earth movement is allowed over a block until it is removed: for allt∈T∖{1},(i,j)∈Nbk,(3.4a)xijt≤Myk,t−1.At the same time, if there is no access road between two blocks, before the first block, or after the last block, earth movement must be prohibited among those sections: for allt∈T∖{1},k1,k2∈I,i,j∈Nbk1,k2,(3.4b)xijt≤Myk1,t−1+Myk2,t−1,for allt∈T∖{1},k∈I,i,j∈Nb←,k,(3.4c)xijt≤Myk,t−1,and for allt∈T∖{1},k∈I,i,j∈Nbk,→,(3.4d)xijt≤Myk,t−1.The next set of block constraints are called the block removal indicator constraints, which set the variables ykt(for allk∈I,t∈T) to the value 1 indicating the block is removed. These constraints in Hare et al. (2011) haveyktVς(k)+andyktVς(k)−(for allk∈I,t∈T) terms that are linear for a earthwork optimization problem but quadratic for the vertical alignment problem. Using linearization techniques from Bisschop (2009), we introduce additional continuous variablesWkt+andWkt−(for allk∈I,t∈T) to ensureWkt+=yktVς(k)+andWkt−=yktVς(k)−by the following equations,(3.4e)0≤Wkt+≤Mς(k)+yktandVς(k)+−Mς(k)+(1−ykt)≤Wkt+≤Vς(k)+,(3.4f)0≤Wkt−≤Mς(k)−yktandVς(k)−−Mς(k)−(1−ykt)≤Wkt−≤Vς(k)−.Finally, the block removal indicator constraints can be written as, for allk∈I,t∈T,(3.4g)∑t=0u∑j∈S∪Wxς(k)jt≥Wku+and∑t=0u∑j∈S∪Bxjς(k)t≥Wku−.Time-steps are defined such that at least one block is removed at each time-step, which is ensured by the following constraints: for allt∈T∖{nz+1},(3.4h)∑k∈Iykt≥tandyk,(t+1)≥yk,t.The volume constraints state the calculation of cut and fill volume of sections using side-slope approximation. Given0<Ai1<Ai2<⋯<Aiki+and0<Bi1<Bi2<⋯<Biki−,these constraints can be written as, for allka∈{1,2,…,ki+}(3.5a)Vi+≥∑k=1ka−1Aiku¯ik+Aika(ui−∑k=1ka−1u¯ik),and for allkb∈{1,2,…,ki−}(3.5b)Vi−≥−∑k=1kb−1Biku̲ik−Bikb(ui−∑k=1kb−1u̲ik).The volume constraints are described in details in Section 4.2. Stockpiling constraints ensure that no stockpiling occurs. In that case, for any sectioni∈Sat least one ofVi+andVi−must be zero, which is assured by binary variables bi. For all sectioni∈S,the stockpiling constraints can be written as(3.6a)Vi+≤Mbi,(3.6b)Vi+≥δbi,(3.6c)Vi−≤M(1−bi),(3.6d)Vi−≥δ(1−bi).The gap constraints are introduced to describe the definition of the variables ui, which is the height difference between the ground profile and the road profile. Koch and Lucet (2010) demonstrated that considering area gap gives a better approximation than considering the height gap in the middle of a section. For allg∈G,i∈Sgthe gap constraints can be written as(3.7)∫sg,isg,i+1hg,idx−∫sg,isg,i+1Pg(x)dx=∫sg,isg,i+1uϰ(g,i)dx.The slope constraints imply that the slope of a spline segment g must not go beyond a minimum value Lgor a maximum value Ugfor safety reasons. Since the spline segments are quadratic, checking the slope bounds at the beginning and end point of the spline segments is sufficient. For allg∈G,i∈{1,ng}the slope constraints can be written as(3.8)Lg≤Pg′(sg,i)≤Ug.The smoothness constraints force the spline segments to be continuous at their joining points, as well as, differentiable. So, for allg∈G∖{1}(3.9)Pg−1(sg,1)=Pg(sg,1)andPg−1′(sg,1)=Pg′(sg,1)The fixed point constraints set the elevation and slope of the road at some predefined points. The setHconsists of pairs (s, H) such that the elevation of the road must be H at station point s, and the setH′consists of pairs(s,H′)such that the slope of the road must beH′at station point s.(3.10)Pg(s)=Hforall(s,H)∈HandPg′(s)=H′forall(s,H′)∈H′,Finally, the bounds for the decision variables are xijt≥ 0, ykt∈ {0, 1},u̲i≤ui≤u¯i,0≤Vi+≤Mi+,0≤Vi−≤Mi−,andag,k∈R.A stockpile-prone section is defined to be a section that is likely to have stockpiling, if the stockpiling constraints are not enforced. So the model can be improved by enforcing constraints (3.6) only for the sections that are stockpile-prone. But there are no known algorithms to detect the stockpile-prone sections for a given ground profile. For this reason, the stockpiling constraints are written for all the sections. However, we will later prove that the binary variable biwill have no effect on the solution time when i is not a stockpile-prone section.Constructed roads must have side-slopes for stability reasons. Not considering side-slopes in the model introduces significant errors in the volume calculation. Figs. 2 and 3 show the approximation of side-slopes for a cut and a fill respectively.The cross-section of a cut i is approximated byki+slabs having elevationsu¯i1,u¯i2,…,u¯iki+and areasAi1,Ai2,…,Aiki+,and a fill i is approximated byki−slabs having elevationsu̲i1,u̲i2,…,u̲iki+and areasBi1,Bi2,…,Biki−with the following assumptions(4.1)0<Ai1<Ai2<⋯<Aiki+and0<Bi1<Bi2<⋯<Biki−.It should be noted thatu̲ikare negative numbers for allk∈{1,2,…,ki−}.Theorem 1If a section i is not a stockpile-prone section, and Assumptions (4.1) hold, then Eqs. (3.5a) and (3.5b) will generate the intended volume approximations,Vi+andVi−.Notice Eq. (3.5a) consists ofki+equations whereVi+is greater or equal to the right hand sides of these equations. SinceVi+is being minimized in the objective function and it is non-negative, at the optimal solution,(4.2)Vi+=max{0,maxka∈{1,2,…,ki+}{∑k=1ka−1Aiku¯ik+Aika(ui−∑k=1ka−1u¯ik)}}.Similarly,(4.3)Vi−=max{0,maxkb∈{1,2,…,ki−}{−∑k=1kb−1Biku̲ik−Bikb(ui−∑k=1kb−1u̲ik)}}.For a cut ui> 0, so for allkb∈{1,2,…,ki−},the terms−∑k=1kb−1Biku̲ik−Bikb(ui−∑k=1kb−1u̲ik)are negative numbers. Therefore,Vi−=0.If0<u¯id<ui≤u¯id+1,then ka= d + 1 gives the maximum term. For all ka< d + 1, the volume for the last d + 1 − kaslabs are calculated by using areaAikaand sinceAika<Aika+1<⋯<Aid+1,the calculated volume cannot be the maximum. For all ka> d + 1, the term(ui−∑k=1ka−1u¯ik)is negative and sinceAid+1<Aid+2<⋯<Aika,the calculated volume cannot be the maximum. So, if0<u¯id<ui≤u¯id+1,Vi+=∑k=1dAiku¯ik+Aid+1(ui−∑k=1du¯ik)is the intended volume, since it is the exact volume up to slab d, and the remaining elevation is multiplied with the area of slab d + 1.Similar logic can be applied for a fill section.□The MILP algorithm will only branch on bi if i is a stockpile-prone section.Consider bito be continuous on 0 ≤ bi≤ 1 instead of binary. If i is not a stockpile-prone section, then eitherVi+orVi−will be zero. IfVi+is zero, then bimust be zero by Eq. (3.6b) since δ > 0. IfVi−is zero, then bimust be 1 by Eq. (3.6d) since δ > 0. So if i is not a stockpile-prone section, biwill not take a fractional value.The branch and bound algorithm for solving mixed integer linear programs (MILP) make branching decisions based on the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the MILP, and the algorithm will branch on only those binary variables that have fractional values on the LP relaxation. So if i is not a stockpile-prone section, the branch and bound algorithm will never branch on bi. The MILP algorithm will run as if the binary variable binever existed. (Most pre-solvers will in fact remove the variable from the optimization problem.)□The best known time complexity of a linear program is polynomially dependent on the number of continuous variables (interior point methods). If the number of constraints is less than the number of continuous variables, then the dual problem can be solved, in which case, the time complexity is polynomially dependent on the number of constraints. If there are integer variables in the problem, then a solution tree is created and at each node of the tree a linear program is solved. So the time complexity of a MILP is exponentially dependent on the number of integer variables. The details of the time complexities of the algorithms can be found in Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004).Proposition 1The MILP hasO(n2nz)continuous variables.The MILP has n variables for excavation volume, n variables for embankment volume, (n2 + nbn + nwn)(nz+ 1) variables for hauling volume, 2nz(nz+ 1) number ofWku+andWku−variables, 3m variables for the spline coefficients, and n variables for section elevation. So, the total number of continuous variables isn+n+(n2+nbn+nwn)(nz+1)+2nz(nz+1)+3m+n=3n+3m+(n2+nbn+nwn+2nz)(nz+1)≤6n+(n2+n2+n2+2nz)(nz+nz)=6n+6n2nz+4nz2since n ≥ nb, n ≥ nw, n ≥ m, and n ≥ nz. (We assume nz≥ 1.)□The MILP hasO(nz2+n)binary variables.The total number of binary variables isnz(nz+1)+n≤2nz2+nassuming nz≥ 1.□The MILP hasO(n2nz3)constraints.The number of constraints are shown in Table 1. The total number of constraints isO(n2nz3).□The algorithms described in Hare et al. (2011) can be adapted to the present model to further improve the computation of a solution.For this model, we seek the answers to the following questions.•How does this model of vertical alignment performs in terms of robustness and accuracy compared to model without side-slopes for vertical alignment?Can we numerically analyze the behavior of the design parameterski+,ki−,and ng, which we believe to be critical to the model, and suggest good values for these parameters?Since the impact of blocks in the earthmoving model was investigated in Hare et al. (2011) and blocks do not further complicated the vertical alignment model, we do not include blocks in our numerical experiments. The added benefit is to simplify the experiments and focus on the answer to the above two questions. From our numerous experiments, we have not noticed any additional impact on the solution time or the error caused by the introduction of blocks beyond those reported in Hare et al. (2011).The experiments in this chapter were performed in a workstation with a Intel(R) Core™ i7-860 2.80GHz (6 cores) processor and 16GB of Random Access Memory (RAM). An academic edition of the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer version 12.2 (http://www.cplex.com) was used to solve the problems.For our experiments, we used 7 distinct road samples provided by our industrial partner Softree Technical Systems Inc (http://www.softree.com). It is worth noting that these road samples come from real terrain that our industrial partner has worked with and provided us for testing. As such they are extremely realistic test problems. We denote these roads with letters from A to G. We generated our problem set by changing different parameters for these roads. Table 2shows the basic information. All the experiments have the following parameters,•Relative MIP gap tolerance: 1 percent,LP feasibility tolerance: 10−6,Maximum run time: 2 hours for each core of the processor totaling 12 hours,Upper bound for slope change: 0.5,Lower bound for slope change: − 0.5,Maximum fill height: 10 meters,Maximum cut height: 10 meters.Other solver and model parameters remain at their default settings.In this test configuration, we compare the described model to a model that applies rectangular approximations for calculating side-slopes (as was done in Moreb (2009)). Our goal is to determine if there is a notable improvement in robustness and accuracy. A model that applies rectangular approximations for calculating side-slopes can be considered a variant of the model in this work with exactly one slab. Since the height of a section is a variable, the accuracy of the approximation of the volume is highly dependent on the choice of area for the section. If the appropriate area is selected, then the accuracy will be very good. However, as the height changes, so does the appropriate value of area. In other words, a single slab model can be very accurate if we can predict the height for each section before solving the model. However, if the prediction of heights is far from the actual calculated heights, then a single slab model can have significant errors. This behavior makes the model very unstable. We consider two strategies for elevation prediction.The first strategy assumes that the output road profile will be very close to the input ground profile. Of course, assuming this will bias the optimizer to choose a solution close to the ground profile. While this strategy may perform well for some examples, for other examples it may perform poorly. We call this approach the Near Ground Model (NGM) approach.The second approach is to predict the height to be the average height. The quality of this approach also depends on the initial guess, but since the initial guess is the average of the extreme guesses, this approach should not perform too poorly, at the same time, we should not expect very good solution from it. We call this approach Average Model (AM) approach.Unlike a single slab model, our model does not depend on any initial guess. From Figs. 2 and 3, we see that as the number of entries in the lookup table,ki+(for a cut section i) andki−(for a fill section i) increase, the approximate volume converges to the actual volume. In addition to comparing with the two single slab variations, we also show the change in accuracy with respect to the change in the values forki+andki−.The reference solution for the experiments is taken as a model with large values forki+andki−for all sections i. For the experiments of this test configuration, we useki+=ki−=400for all section i, as the reference solution.For each of the roads of Table 2, we generated 10 problems for 10 different values ofki+andki−,as well as 2 problems for the AM and NGM approaches. It should be noted that our model withki+=ki−=1is the same as a model generated by the AM approach. Therefore, for this test configuration, we generated 11 problems for each of the 7 roads totaling 77 problems with the naming convention R-k, where R is a road from Table 2, and k either represents the value forki+andki−for all sections i, or AM or NGM. Table 3summarizes the problem set. For this test configuration, the other parameters are,•number of sections per spline segment: ng= 2 for allg∈G,number of blocks: nz= 0,number of access roads: nr= 1.To ensure feasibility, we add an access road to the first section for each of the problems.We used the following three-steps procedure for each of the problems in Table 3 to calculate the accuracy.•In step 1, we solve the given model and save the output vertical alignment and the optimal cost. We denote the optimal cost of this step with CR, k.In step 2, we generate a model with the same parameters as the given model exceptki+=ki−=400,then we input the vertical alignment from step 1 to this model, and solve only for the earthwork operations. The optimal cost of this step is the optimal cost with the corrected volume for the vertical alignment of step 1. We denote this cost withCR,k400.In step 3, we use the formulasϵR,k=CR,k−CR,k400CR,k400×100percent to get the percent relative error.We normalized the solution time with respect to the solution times with the model withki+=ki−=400to accommodate all the roads in the same graph. If tR, kis the required time for Road R withki+=ki−=k,then the normalized time is defined as(5.1)t¯R,k=tR,ktR,400.
