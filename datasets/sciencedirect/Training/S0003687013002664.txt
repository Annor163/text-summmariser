@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The present study brings together for the first time the techniques of hierarchical task analysis (HTA), human error identification (HEI), and business process management (BPM) to select practices that can eliminate or reduce potential errors in a surgical setting. We applied the above approaches to the improvement of the patient positioning process for lumbar spine surgery referred to as ‘direct lateral interbody fusion’ (DLIF). Observations were conducted to gain knowledge on current DLIF positioning practices, and an HTA was constructed. Potential errors associated with the practices specific to DLIF patient positioning were identified. Based on literature review and expert views alternative practices are proposed aimed at improving the DLIF patient positioning process. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use BPM in association with HEI/HTA for the purpose of improving the performance and safety of a surgical process – with promising results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) seeks to provide an understanding of human–human and human–machine interactions (Rose and Bearman, 2012). HTA describes a system in terms of its goals. It begins with a main task defined by its intended goals and breaks down the main task into its components tasks. Each sub-task having a sub-goal to achieve – all of which taken together contribute towards achievement of the main task goal (Stanton, 2006). These sub-tasks may be further analysed to their constituent tasks and so on. Levels of analysis of a main task depend on complexity and required description of the task or goal (Lane et al., 2006; Phipps et al., 2008). Rules guide the sequence in which sub-goals are attained to achieve the ‘higher’ goal (Phipps et al., 2008) and, accordingly, higher levels in the hierarchy influence the manner in which lower levels behave (Shepherd, 2010). Task analysis is also a useful way of looking at how people interact with work processes and environments.To date, HTA has successfully been used in association with human error identification (HEI) techniques to detect potential human errors (Rose and Bearman, 2012; Stanton, 2006; Stanton et al., 2009). HEI techniques are structured methods dealing with work processes, technologies and human factors to predict or detect human errors (Stanton et al., 2009). The ‘error mode’ taxonomy of an HEI is used to highlight potentially unforseen errors in the lowest level tasks of an HTA (Phipps et al., 2008; Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002; Stanton et al., 2009). Once the potential error or disruption is predicted, an error reduction strategy can be implemented (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). HEI has been widely used across the industry (Rose and Bearman, 2012), for example in aviation (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). Recently, HEI techniques have been successfully applied to predict potential disruptions and errors in healthcare services, including medication administration (Lane et al., 2006), anaesthesia (Phipps et al., 2008) and surgery (Joice et al., 1998).In surgical settings, when a patient gets transferred into the operating room (OR) to have a surgical procedure carried out, several tasks should be accomplished – including patient positioning on the operating table. These tasks are shared between different members of the OR team – including surgeons, anaesthetists, and OR nurses. For the purpose of this paper, the way in which a task is planned to achieve its goal is referred to as ‘practice’. A practice can also be expressed in terms of the sub-goals and the plan via which these sub-goals are sequenced to achieve the higher goal. Different practices may be used to perform the same task. For instance, anaesthesia induction may be performed on the patient transfer trolley in an anaesthetic room adjacent to the OR or on the operating table in the OR depending on circumstance. From a human factors and ergonomic analysis perspective, each practice implies a range of potential errors with different consequences. Where more than one practices can be used to perform a task, it is commonly expected of the operating surgeon to select the practice producing minimal potential risk to the patient. Thus the question arises whether some of these practices have lower error potential – and hence whether such practices should be recommended as standards.To address this question, in this paper we consider the OR as a business entity in which various business processes are performed to achieve the strategic target of the business entity; patient safety. This allows us to integrate HTA/HEI with the business process management (BPM) approach and to apply principles of BPM to select practices that can eliminate or reduce potential errors.Prior to reporting our analyses and in order to provide a full rationale for our approach, we first explore the limitations of the current HTA/HEI approaches.As described in the literature, HTA/HEI techniques examine the lowest level of HTA hierarchy for potential errors (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002). Joice et al. (1998) classified errors captured by HTA/HEI techniques into two groups; ‘interstep’ errors and ‘intrastep’ errors. An iterstep error occurs when the operator (e.g. surgeon) fails to execute a sub-task or re-arrange its sequence; an intrastep error involves the failure of a surgeon to correctly execute an individual sub-task. These types of errors are reported in the surgical literature as ‘errors of execution’ (Kohn et al., 2000; Sevdalis et al., 2008; Wiegmann et al., 2007). However, the literature also points to another type of errors referred to as ‘errors of planning’ which occurs when a surgeon fails to select the most appropriate practice to achieve the task’s strategic goal, that is, patient safety. A specific practice in surgery may enhance capacity and performance in certain environments but may have no effect in others; for example, obtaining unobstructed images on both cross-table anterosterior and lateral views is essential for spinal surgery known as ‘direct lateral interbody fusion’, or DLIF (Arnold et al., 2012) but not needed for other procedures requiring lateral positioning of the patient. Further, a practice may lead to an error in a situation but the same practice may be necessary in another situation based on the patient’s physiological status, which differs from one patient to another. An example of this is allowing an awake patient to walk from a trolley to the operating table. This practice could create an error if the patient is obese (Philips, 2004). It is therefore difficult to identify real potential errors based on examining only lower-level tasks without examining practices used to achieve higher-level tasks.What appears to be a key limitation of the current HTA/HEI approaches is that they typically identify potential errors in a predefined set of sub-tasks, rather than examining potential errors in practice selection (see example above). Another issue in HEI approaches is that they typically require a set of generic error modes as part of their error taxonomies – but these modes, as a result of examining individual lower-level tasks, may not necessarily identify the whole range of potential errors (Stanton et al., 2009; Stanton et al., 2005) – and there may even be difficulty in specifying a single mode for error (Joice et al., 1998). Such limitations of the current HTA/HEI approaches could be tackled by developing an error taxonomy that has the capability to identify practices with high potential risk to patient safety and to help in selecting alternative practices. This will be developed in the ‘Methods’ section.In this paper, patient positioning for lumbar spine surgery referred to as ‘direct lateral interbody fusion’ (DLIF) is used as an illustrative case to demonstrate that our methodology can be used to support surgical safety and performance. It is important to note that in developing our methodology we have not intended to discard HTA/HEI techniques. We believe that examination of a practice should be carried out prior to the analysis of the lower-level tasks required to achieve the practice. Once practices that form a process are examined and improved using our methodology, traditional HTA/HEI can be effectively applied further.In the sections that follow, we first start with the description of BPM and then explain the aims of patient positioning, followed by description of the DLIF surgery requirements. We discuss the methodology we used to improve DLIF and our findings. We conclude with a discussion of the research, including its limitations and applications to spinal surgery and beyond.Some of the above limitations of HTA/HEI approaches can be overcome by considering major tasks conducted in the OR as business processes that require improvement or redesign. A business process is a structured set of activities (tasks and sub-tasks) designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer (Davenport, 1993). The emphasis on a ‘particular customer’ implies that the set of activities may vary according to the need and status of the customer. This definition fits the processes conducted in ORs, in which the ‘particular customer’ is the patient whose physiological status can affect the type and sequence of certain activities required for positioning. The business process concept allows treating obese or diabetic patients, for instance, differently from other patients.Simple identification of a business process itself is of limited use; a technique or procedure is needed to improve or redesign the process. One widely known approach is business process management (BPM). BPM is defined as an organisational approach that encompasses the methods required to align business processes with strategic objectives and customers’ needs(da Silva et al., 2012). For surgery, the customer is the patient and a main strategic objective is the patient’s safety. Weske et al (2004) expanded the definition of BPM to include “using methods, techniques, and software to design, enact, control and analyse operational process involving humans, organisations, applications, documents and other sources of information”. It follows that BPM questions the status quo, identifies best practices for improving or redesigning value-added activities and eliminates non-value-added activities (Choong, 2013; Turner et al., 2004; Yin, 2010). An important aspect of BPM is that it considers information technologies and also information flow and communication problems (Choong, 2013; Hammer, 2010; Yen, 2009). Task analysis is also essential to achieve the aims of BPM – usually activity-based task analyses. Activity-based task analysis (or flowcharting) considers the physical task at hand and divides it into its components (sub-tasks). This is different from the goal-based analysis of HTA, in which a task is described by its goal, which in turn is divided into sub-goals. Using HTA within the context of BPM application is another novelty of our work.Patient positioning comprises several major (first or upper-level) tasks, in which each task can be carried out using different practices. The lower-level tasks for each practice could be performed correctly as designed – however the practice itself may imply high potential safety risk, for which extra resources, effort, time and/or excess precaution is required to avoid error. For example, moving a patient from a trolley onto the operating table requires several lower-level tasks. The practice of moving a patient while the trolley is not adjacent to the operating table carries higher risk compared to the practice of moving the patient with the trolley adjacent to the operating table. The lower-level tasks for the former practice could be performed without errors but the practice requires extra resources and precautions. Currently available HEI taxonomies have not been designed to examine practices, as explained in Section 1.2, and accordingly we need to develop a taxonomy that examines practices rather than lower-level tasks. This is the main principle of our HTA/HEI error taxonomy. Within the framework of BPM, the error taxonomy should examine practices and allow selection of the best practices.In order to do so, we developed an error taxonomy that comprises three interrelated sets of sub-taxonomies; practice selection modes, practice error modes and practice selection criteria. The ‘practice selection modes’ include a set of practices that possess high probability of direct safety risk to the patient (problematic practices) and, accordingly, require extra resources, precaution, effort, time and/or skill to perform the practice without errors. These practice selection modes also comprise suggestions for remedies and alternative safer practices. The second set of modes is the ‘practice error modes’, which identify potential errors that may occur from implementing a practice. It is possible that there is more than one alternative for replacing a problematic practice. To avoid error in selection, a set of ‘practice selection criteria’ is needed. The criteria should consider patient status, resource availability, risk reduction and the effect of the newly proposed practice on other practices used to perform the process.To achieve the integration of HTA with BPM, the analysis for HTA should cover practices used to implement the process. At each level of hierarchy, a task is examined and if the task can be implemented by more than one practice, it will be analysed into its components. Otherwise, no further analysis is needed.This paper considers patient positioning for DLIF. In order for BPM to be successful, the DLIF surgery requirements that require to be achieved during patient positioning should be identified. This is the subject of the next two sections.Patient positioning for surgery aims to achieve patient safety across three dimensions: it exposes adequately the operative field for the surgeon, facilitates patient’s monitoring and minimises the risk of adverse physiological effects (Philips, 2004). Modern use of endoscopic or laparoscopic (‘keyhole’) surgical techniques adds a fourth dimension to the objective of patient positioning, that is, the positioning facilitates the use of the sophisticated instruments and technologies during surgery. There is a large number of positioning types – including supine, prone, lateral and lithotomy. Each positioning type has several variations with different levels of complexity. Patient positioning is usually selected before the day of surgery by the surgeon in consultation with the anaesthetist – thereby also entailing a communication aspect.As mentioned earlier, the patient positioning for DLIF is used as an illustrative case to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology. DLIF requires lateral position (Arnold et al., 2012). However, patient positioning for DLIF is more complex than lateral positioning for other procedures due to specific requirements that should be achieved during positioning before the start of surgery as discussed in the next section.The lumbar interbody fusion at L4-5 and above comprises a complete discectomy and preparation of plates followed by the placement of structural implant (Billinghurst and Akbarnia, 2009). Several approaches to lumbar spine surgery have been developed since the early 20thcentury. The anterior approach to the lumbar spine was first introduced in 1930s. The posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) was introduced in 1945. The laparoscopic lumbar discectomy was first described by Obenchain in 1991(Obenchain, 1991). The surgery was further enhanced in the mid-1990s by using laparoscopic anterior lumbar fusion (Daniel et al., 2002; Zuckerman et al., 1996). In these traditional surgical approaches, the patient is placed in the prone position.The reported serious complications from these traditional approaches shifted surgical techniques towards minimally invasive surgery (MIS) (Ozgur et al., 2006) with the aim of minimising soft-tissue trauma associated with spinal surgery (Fessler, 2002). In 2001, DLIF was first reported, subsequently becoming increasingly preferred for lumbar spinal surgery (Anand and Baron, 2011; Arnold et al., 2012; Billinghurst and Akbarnia, 2009; Ozgur et al., 2006). The aim of DLIF is “to achieve a spinal fusion procedure via a lateral approach in order to avoid the major muscle groups in the back (posterior approach) or the organs and blood vessels in the abdomen (anterior approach)” (NICE, 2013). DLIF differs from traditional spine surgery approaches in that the patient is placed in a true lateral decubitus position rather than in prone position (Fig. 1). The surgery is relatively simple and involves minimal soft-tissue disruption. It decreases operative time, decreases the recovery period, and shortens hospital stay(Billinghurst and Akbarnia, 2009).DLIF has a number of specific requirements that should be ensured during the patient positioning before starting the operation, as follows (Anand and Baron, 2011; Billinghurst and Akbarnia, 2009):1.Maximising the gap between the iliac crest and the 12th rib in order to gain direct access to the disc space;Obtaining unobstructed images of the disc space under interest on both cross-table anterosterior and lateral views;Ensuring continuous neural monitoring.Various practices can be used to achieve the first requirement, including inserting a large bag under the hip of the patient, flexing the operating table and/or using an elevated cushion attached to the operating table known as kidney rest (Anand and Baron, 2011). To achieve the second requirement, fluoroscopy is used repeatedly during positioning. This can be done with C-arm fluoroscopy perpendicular to the floor (Anand and Baron, 2011; Webb et al., 2010). Neural monitoring, including electromyography (EMG) is essential and mandatory to avoid potential risk of nerves injury (Arnold et al., 2012; Tohmeh et al., 2011). Several position readjustments may also be required in order to achieve the required correct position of the patient prior to commencement of the procedure (Webb et al., 2010). These requirements should be managed in a way that minimises adverse physiological effects. Nerve location is variable, reinforcing the second requirement to ensure positioning that allows having real-time fluoroscopic lateral images. Incorrect management of the first requirement may create excessive posterior location of the venous in one side relative to the other that may increase the risk facing patient vena cava and right common iliac vein (Kepler et al., 2011). In addition, DLIF bluntly splits the psoas fibres – a splitting technique that exposes the lumbar plexus and femoral nerves to potential injury (Benglis et al., 2009; Kepler et al., 2011). Further, the operative corridor is directly lateral to the disc and thus the aorta vena cava and iliac vessels are typically not visualised or at risk (Kepler et al., 2011).
