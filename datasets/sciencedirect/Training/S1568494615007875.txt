@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Data clustering is a technique for grouping similar and dissimilar data. Many clustering algorithms fail when dealing with multi-dimensional data. This paper introduces efficient methods for data clustering by Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm; called COAC and Fuzzy Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm, called FCOAC. The COA by inspire of cuckoo bird nature life tries to solve continuous problems. This algorithm clusters a large dataset to prior determined clusters numbers by this meta-heuristic algorithm and optimal the results by fuzzy logic. Firstly, the algorithm generates a random solutions equal to cuckoo population and with length dataset objects and with a cost function calculates the cost of each solution. Finally, fuzzy logic tries for the optimal solution. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated and compared with COAC, Black hole, CS, K-mean, PSO and GSA. The results show that our algorithm has better performance in comparison with them.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Clustering is a main task in data analysis applications. Data clustering technique is introduced for grouping similar or dissimilar data in a given dataset. Grouping, decision-making, machine-learning situations, data mining, document retrieval, image segmentation and pattern classification are some important applications of clustering techniques [1]. Research in exact algorithms, heuristics and meta-heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems is increasingly relevant as data science grapples with larger and more complex data sets [2].Hierarchical and partitional as mentioned in [3,4] are two categories of traditional clustering algorithms. In hierarchical clustering, the number of clusters need not be specified a prior but by partitional methods it should be determined. As a result, hierarchical methods cannot always separate overlapping clusters. Additionally, hierarchical clustering is static and points committed to a given cluster in the early stages cannot be moved between clusters [5]. While the partitional clustering divide in two categories: crisp clustering where each data point belongs to just one cluster and fuzzy clustering where every data point belongs to every cluster to some degree [6,7].Xin-She and Deb in 2009 [8] proposed a Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. In 2011, Rajabioun [9] improved this algorithm and introduced a meta-heuristic algorithm called Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA). COA has some priorities toward CS such as faster convergence, higher speed, high accuracy, local search ability along with general search, search with variable population (population extinction due to poor areas), ability to quickly solve optimization problems with high dimensions and so on. Fuzzy sets a theory that originally introduced by Zadeh [10,11] and it has been developed for expanded linguistic values. The linguistic values are terms which are used instead of numbers and fuzzy set theory [12]. Implementation of multi-criteria control strategies is enabling by rule based FLCs usage. When information is not complete, fuzzy logic is able to make real time decisions. Fuzzy logic systems are able to manipulate the linguistic rules in a natural way and they are particularly suitable in several context like clustering applications. This paper presents a new optimization approach to data clustering based on the COA and Fuzzy COA for decreasing clustering error rate. In fact, the dividing of clusters is dynamically regulated by a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC).The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we have a brief discussion related with works on data clustering. Section 3, shows COA and we have a full description of it. Our work is introduced in Section 4 with some samples for more realization. Also, the performance of our proposal is evaluated with several benchmark datasets and the results are compared with some well-known works. Finally, Section 5 summarize and conclude our work.
