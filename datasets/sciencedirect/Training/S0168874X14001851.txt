@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The arc welding process involves thermal cycles that cause the appearance of undesirable residual stresses. The determination of this thermal cycle is the first step to a thermomechanical analysis that allows the numerical calculation of residual stresses. This study describes the formulation of a 2D finite element with through the thickness parabolic temperature distribution, including an element estabilization procedure. The 2D element described in this paper can be used to perform thermal analysis more economically than 3D elements, especially in plates, because the number of degrees of freedom through the thickness will always be three. A numerical model of a tungsten arc welding (GTAW) setup was made based on published experimental results. Size and distribution of the heat source input, thermal properties dependent on temperature, surface heat losses by convection and latent heat during phase change were considered. In parallel the same setup was modeled using ANSYS software with 3D elements (SOLID70) to compare against 2D numerical results. The results obtained by 2D model, 3D model and experimental data showed good agreement.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Welding is a fabrication process widely used in industry, being employed in various industries such as petrochemical, aerospace, automotive, marine and others. The fusion welding provides the union between two parts by melting and subsequent solidification of the welding areas. During this process a small area of the part is subjected to very high temperatures, while the temperature in the rest of the parts remains low. This strong thermal gradient is responsible for the appearance of undesirable residual stresses and consequent deformations.The determination of the residual stresses of welding has been studied by several papers [1]. Rosenthal [2] was one of the pioneers in the study of welded joints with the proposition of an analytical solution for plates with small thicknesses and concentrated heat source. Ueda [3] provided the basis for analyses that consider temperature-dependent properties. The finite element method has proved to be a powerful tool in numerical analysis to predict the temperature field, residual stresses and deformations. Lindgren reviews the use of this tool in simulations of welding, including aspects to be considered in the model [4]. In the majority of analyses a twofold procedure is adopted: a pure thermal analysis followed by a mechanical analysis with the calculated temperatures [5]. The finite element technique was used by Long [6] to investigate distortions and residual stresses induced in a MIG welding process of thin plates. The FE results obtained by Long were compared with experimental data and empirical predictions, showing reasonable agreement. Furthermore, the plate thickness and the welding speed showed to have great influence on residual stresses and welding distortions. Deng and Murakawa [7] used different formulations of thermo-elastic–plastic FE methods to compare welding distortions in a low carbon steel thin plate butt-welded. Zhu and Chao [8] investigated the effect of temperature-dependent material properties on residual stresses, distortions and temperature field in the numerical simulations of welding. They conclude that the thermal conductivity has certain effect on the distribution of transient temperature fields during welding. Barroso et al. [9] studied several simplification hypotheses in numerical welding models and compared the results with experimental data. They reported that, in most cases, the simplifying hypotheses lead to quite acceptable results.Bergman and Oldenburg [10] proposed a thermal shell element with in-plane linear variation of temperature and quadratic variation along the thickness. This element is similar to the one formulated in this work but the explicit formulation is used to numerically integrate the governing equations in time. Another major difference is that the present element has a stabilization scheme which permits the use of relatively coarse meshes to successfully obtain accurate results in the presence of thermal shocks or in regions where high temperature gradients are known to exist.Heat transfer finite element analyses of 3D media are necessary if one intends to determine the through-the-thickness temperature distribution in welded structures. The downside of 3D models is the inherent huge number of degrees of freedom and badly conditioned elements if the plate is moderately thin. Turning to 2D elements almost never provides realistic results since the assumption of constant through-the-thickness temperature distribution holds only in regions away from the weldment fillet or groove. However, the most critical regions in the structure are precisely those close to the weldment fillet or groove commonly denominated heat affected zone. In this zone the heat source is located on the top surface of the welded plate whereas the bottom surface is often modeled to be in natural convection.This work presents a new 2D heat transfer element that has parabolic through-the-thickness temperature distribution. The quadratic nature of the temperature distribution is motivated by findings of previous works that point to parabolic through-the-thickness stress distributions [11–13]. Assuming a linear relation between stresses and temperature increment the parabolic temperature distribution is thereby justified.It will be shown that the 2D element proposed may be prone to numerical illness. This is due to the different time scales of the heat transfer process. For small thicknesses heat conduction from the hot top plate surface to the cool bottom plate surface is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, in-plane heat conduction takes place at a different time scale since, usually, distances traveled by the heat flow are at least one order of magnitude larger than heat flowing along the transverse direction. A stabilization procedure is therefore necessary to avoid the numerical illnesses mentioned.The transient heat conduction equation in Cartesian coordinates is given by(1)ρc∂T∂t=−∂qx∂x−∂qy∂y−∂qz∂z+Qwhere T is temperature, ρ is density, c is specific heat, qx, qy, qzare heat fluxes in the x, y and z directions, and Q is internal heat generation per unit volume. The heat fluxes relate to the temperature gradient according to the Fourier law of heat conduction(2)q={qxqyqz}=−[kxxkxykxzkxykyykyzkxzkyzkzz]{∂T/∂x∂T/∂y∂T/∂z}=−k∇Twhere kijare the Cartesian components of the conductivity tensorkand the temperature gradient vector is ∇T={∂T/∂x ∂T/∂y ∂T/∂z}T.The variational principle tied to Eq. (1) is derived multiplying it by a virtual temperature variation δT. It should be clear that δT is arbitrary but it must satisfy all conditions of prescribed temperature, i.e., if T is known for a given point (x, y, z), then δT must be zero at that particular point. Multiplication of Eq. (1) by δT and integration over the plate domain Ω leads to(3)∫Ω[ρc∂T∂tδT+(∂qx∂x+∂qy∂y+∂qz∂z)δT−QδT]dΩ=0Straight application of the divergence theorem yields(4)∫Ω(∂qx∂x+∂qy∂y+∂qz∂z)δTdΩ=∫Ω[∂(qxδT)∂x+∂(qyδT)∂y+∂(qzδT)∂z]dΩ−∫Ω(qx∂δT∂x+qy∂δT∂y+qz∂δT∂z)dΩ=∫ΓqTnδTdΓ+∫Ω(∇δT)Tk(∇T)dΩwherenis the unit normal vector pointing outwards the boundary surface Γ of Ω. Notice that Eq. (2) has been used in the derivation of Eq. (4). Substitution of Eq. (4) into (3) gives(5)∫Ωρc∂T∂tδTdΩ+∫Ω(∇δT)Tk(∇T)dΩ=∫ΩQδTdΩ−∫ΓqTnδTdΓEq. (5) is recognized as the variational principle associated with heat transfer problems. In the right-hand side two loading terms appear: internal heat generation and boundary heat exchange. There are basically three common forms of boundary heat exchange: (i) prescribed heat flux whereqTnis a known function, (ii) heat convection whereqTn=hc(T−T∞), and (iii) radiative flux whereqTn=hr(T−T∞). The convective heat transfer coefficient hcmay depend on T and the radiative heat transfer coefficient hris definitely a function of the temperature T. T∞ is the environment temperature.Fig. 1 shows the element topology chosen. In order to be economical in terms of degrees of freedom the element is 4-noded and has bilinear shape functions over its local plane xy.In the local transverse direction z the temperature distribution is assumed to be parabolic such that, for a given point within the element, the temperature T is(6)T(x,y,z,t)=Ta(x,y,t)+zTb(x,y,t)+z2Tc(x,y,t)where z is the local transverse coordinate measured along the thickness. Tais the zero order term, zTbis the linear term and z2Tcis the quadratic term. These three terms are in turn interpolated using the bilinear shape functions with mapping coordinates ξ∈[−1, +1] and η∈[−1, +1](7)N1(ξ,η)=14(1−ξ)(1−η),N2(ξ,η)=14(1+ξ)(1−η)N3(ξ,η)=14(1+ξ)(1+η),N4(ξ,η)=14(1−ξ)(1+η)such that(8)Ta=Ta1N1+Ta2N2+Ta3N3+Ta4N4Tb=Tb1N1+Tb2N2+Tb3N3+Tb4N4Tc=Tc1N1+Tc2N2+Tc3N3+Tc4N4where Ta1, …, Tc4 are nodal degrees of freedom. The units of Ta, Tband Tcare not the same since they are multiplied by 1, z and z2, respectively.Based on Eq. (8) element local vectors of degrees of freedom are defined as:qa={Ta1Ta2Ta3Ta4}T,qb={Tb1Tb2Tb3Tb4}Tandqc={Tc1Tc2Tc3Tc4}T. The variation counterparts are then δqa={δTa1δTa2δTa3δTa4}T, δqb={δTb1δTb2δTb3δTb4}Tand δqc={δTc1δTc2δTc3δTc4}T. Also, the matrix of in-plane shape functions is defined asN=[N1N2N3N4]. Using these definitions Eq. (6) and its variational counterpart can be written as(9)T(x,y,z,t)=N(qa+zqb+z2qc)δT(x,y,z,t)=N(δqa+zδqb+z2δqc)Two terms are in the left-hand side of Eq. (5). These can be calculated for each element e and its domain Ωe. Using Eq. (9) the first term is(10)∫Ωeρc∂T∂tδTdΩ=∫Ωeρc{δqaδqbδqc}T[NTNzNTNz2NTNzNTNz2NTNz3NTNz2NTNz3NTNz4NTN]{q̇aq̇bq̇c}dΩThe second term in the left-hand side of Eq. (5) is more elaborate since it requires computation of ∇T and ∇δT. This is achieved, again, using Eq. (9).(11)∇T={∂T/∂x∂T/∂y∂T/∂z}=[∂N/∂xz∂N/∂xz2∂N/∂x∂N/∂yz∂N/∂yz2∂N/∂y0N2zN]{qaqbqc}∇δT={∂δT/∂x∂δT/∂y∂δT/∂z}=[∂N/∂xz∂N/∂xz2∂N/∂x∂N/∂yz∂N/∂yz2∂N/∂y0N2zN]{δqaδqbδqc}Substitution of Eq. (11) into the second term in the left-hand side of Eq. (5) yields(12)∫Ωe(∇δT)Tk(∇T)dΩ=∫Ωe{δqaδqbδqc}T[∂NT/∂x∂NT/∂y0Tz∂NT/∂xz∂NT/∂yNTz2∂NT/∂xz2∂NT/∂y2zNT]×k[∂N/∂xz∂N/∂xz2∂N/∂x∂N/∂yz∂N/∂yz2∂N/∂y0N2zN]{qaqbqc}dΩBased on Eqs. (10) and (12), the element heat capacitance matrixMeand element conductivity matricesKeare given by(13)Me=∫Ωeρc[NTNzNTNz2NTNzNTNz2NTNz3NTNz2NTNz3NTNz4NTN]dΩ(14)Ke=∫Ωe[∂NT/∂x∂NT/∂y0Tz∂NT/∂xz∂NT/∂yNTz2∂NT/∂xz2∂NT/∂y2zNT]k[∂N/∂xz∂N/∂xz2∂N/∂x∂N/∂yz∂N/∂yz2∂N/∂y0N2zN]dΩBothMeandKeare symmetric and 12×12. Moreover, notice that the local coordinate z is explicitly present in their computations. One might be tempted to integrate analytically through the thickness. However, the thermal properties c andkare likely to vary with temperature, particularly in welding problems where elevated temperatures are common. Therefore the most indicated method to computeMeandKeis numerical integration along x, y and z. The Gauss quadrature recipe applicable to the bilinear isoparametric element requires 2 integration points along x and 2 along y. In the transverse direction z the terms containing z4 require at least 3 integration points.In order to illustrate a basic flaw of element formulated using parabolic temperature distribution through the thickness consider the simple 1D steady state problem of a beam shown inFig. 2. It has total length 2L, thickness h and both ends have Ta, Tband Tcprescribed.Considering the practical case of a diagonal conductivity tensork=diag(kxxkyykzz) and constant thermal properties the differential equations that govern the problem are:(15a)kxx∂2Ta∂x2+kxxh212∂2Tc∂x2=0,(15b)kzzTb−kxxh212∂2Tb∂x2=0,(15c)kzzTc−kxx14∂2Ta∂x2−kxxh216∂2Tc∂x2=0Eqs. (15a) and (15c) couple Taand Tc. However, decoupling is simple and, in view of the homogeneous boundary conditions for Taand Tc, leads to the solution Ta(x)=Tc(x)=0. The analytical solution for Tbis(16)Tb(x)=T0cosh(sx)cosh(sL),s2=12kzzh2kxxFig. 3 shows a comparison between the exact solution given in Eq. (16) and the numerical solution obtained with no stabilization. It is obvious from Fig. 3 that wide oscillations occur. Increasing the number of elements in the FE mesh certainly alleviates the numerical problem but it cannot be completely eliminated by that subterfuge alone. Moreover, one of the most attractive features of the FE method is its ability to approximate solutions with a relatively small number of simple elements. Within this context, mesh refinement enhances the results but tends to overburden the numerical procedures.The question to be answered now is why the proposed element does not deliver accurate results. The answer is obtained by comparing the exact solution of the problem, Eq. (16), against the finite element solution. Considering a uniform FE mesh and two adjacent elements of length leas shown inFig. 4 it is possible to write the stencil of the finite element scheme associated with line i:(17)kxxh212le(−Tb,i−1+2Tb,i−Tb,i+1)+kzzle6(Tb,i−1+4Tb,i+Tb,i+1)=0After defining(18)r2=12kzzle2kxxh2Eq. (17) can be recast as(19)Tb,i−1(16−1r2)+2Tb,i(13+1r2)+Tb,i+1(16−1r2)=0In order to compare the exact and the numerical solutions it is important to determine what should have been the FE scheme stencil to precisely reproduce the exact solution given by Eq. (16). Assuming that node i has coordinate xiand using Eq. (16),(20)Tb,i−1=T0cosh[s(xi−le)]cosh(sL),Tb,i=T0cosh(sxi)cosh(sL),Tb,i+1=T0cosh[s(xi+le)]cosh(sL)The stencil presented in Eq. (19) is of the form(21)α1Tb,i−1+α2Tb,i+α3Tb,i+1=0where α1, α2, α3 are coefficients to be determined. Substitution of Eq. (20) into (21) and grouping terms the following conditions must be met:(22)α1=α3,α2=−2α1cosh(sle)Hence, substitution of Eq. (22) into (21) yields(23)−Tb,i−1+2cosh(sle)Tb,i−Tb,i+1=0which can be rewritten as(24)Tb,i−1(16−1r2)+2cosh(sle)Tb,i(1r2−16)+Tb,i+1(16−1r2)=0Comparison between Eqs. (24) and (19) reveals the error incurred when the numerical FE solution is adopted: the coefficient in Tb,iis wrong. The question is now how much must be subtracted from the FE stencil to exactly reproduce Eq. (19). This is given by(25)13+1r2−α=cosh(r)(1r2−16)⇒α=13+1r2+cosh(r)(16−1r2)The value of r given in Eq. (18) is usually large since kxxand kzzare equal and the relation le/h is very large. Thus one approximation is α≈cosh(r)/6. Additionally, since r is large, it is acceptable that cosh(r)/6 may be replaced by a large number.In practice the procedure adopted for correction of the FE equations is to subtract α=hlekzzcosh(r)/6 from the main diagonal related to the Tbdegrees of freedom of the element conductivity matrixKe, cosh(r)/6 replaced by a large number (1000). In the case of 2D problems the correction depends on the element area Aeand is given by α=hAekzzcosh(r)/6. Similar reasoning shows that, in general, the main diagonal related to the Tcdegrees of freedom must also be corrected using the same procedure just presented.The heat transfer problem posed in Eq. (5) can be discretized in space using the heat capacitance matrixMeand element conductivity matricesKegiven in Eqs. (13) and (14). Additionally, element thermal load vectorsfemay be derived using Eqs. (6)–(8). When the global matrix equations are assembled they result in(26)MṪ+KT=fwhereM,Kandfare the global counterparts ofMe,Keandfe, andTis the global vector of nodal temperatures.In steady state problems the temperature is assumed constant leading to a problem in the form(27)KT=fEq. (27) is nonlinear whenKandfdepend on temperature. Nonlinearity may also arise depending on the thermal loading and boundary conditions. A simple recurring scheme to solve the nonlinear Eq. (27) is the Picard method[14] given by(28)K(Tn)Tn+1=fnwhere the superscript n represents the iteration number. The procedure progresses until the tolerance ε is achieved, computed as follows:(29)(Tn+1−Tn)T(Tn+1−Tn)(Tn+1)TTn+1<ε2The Picard method is usually good enough to achieve convergence in a few iterations. However, in highly nonlinear problems, more elaborate schemes may be required that adopt the concept of relaxation. In the problems tackled in this work the Picard method has proven to be good enough.IfTis time dependent some type of numerical time marching scheme must be employed. The most basic time integration procedure available is the forward Euler method. However, stability issues disavow the forward Euler method because it would require extremely small time steps. A more general approach, called generalized midpoint method, consists in evaluating Eq. (26) in an intermediate time step, in between n and n+1 such that(30)Ṫa=1Δt(Tn+1−Tn),Ta=(1−θ)Tn+θTn+1where θ is an arbitrary parameter with 0≤θ≤1. When Eq. (26) is evaluated atTait results in(31)1ΔtM(Ta)(Tn+1−Tn)+θK(Ta)Tn+1=f(Ta)−(1−θ)K(Ta)Tnwhere Δt=tn+1−tnis the time step. Different values of θ lead to different time marching schemes. When θ=0 the forward Euler method is produced. When θ=1 the backward Euler method is produced which is an implicit method. In general θ>0 produces implicit schemes but the only second order accurate is the Crank–Nicolson obtained with θ=1/2. Substitution of θ=12into (30) and (31) gives:(32)Ta=Tn+Tn+12(33)1ΔtM(Ta)(Tn+1−Tn)+12K(Ta)Tn+1+12K(Ta)Tn=f(Ta)Considering thatTn+1=2Ta−Tn, the Crank–Nicolson scheme applied to Eq. (31) yields(34)[2ΔtM(Ta)+K(Ta)]Ta=f(Ta)+2ΔtM(Ta)Tnwhich is an implicit equation whose solution deliversTa. The Picard method presented in Eq. (28) can be effectively used to solve Eq. (34). OnceTais computed the algorithm advances in time throughTn+1=2Ta−Tn. One important aspect of the Crank–Nicolson method is that it is theoretically unconditionally stable, i.e., any Δt is guaranteed not to diverge, although temporal oscillations may occur if Δt is too big.The phase change process in the weld pool needs to absorb or release thermal energy described by latent heat. There are several methods to take into account the latent heat. These methods are usually divided into fixed and moving mesh methods. In the moving mesh method the phase change interface is determined as a moving boundary and solid and liquid region are analyzed separately. The fixed mesh methods account for the phase change condition implicitly, involving a solution of a continuous system, without attempting to establish the position of the interface. The moving mesh method requires a sophisticated front tracking algorithm, while with a simpler approach is possible to use a fixed grid [15,16].The enthalpy is defined by(35)H=∫TrTρ(T)c(T)dTAnd(36)dHdT=ceff=ρ(T)c(T)where ceffis the effective heat capacity.Eq. (1) can be rewritten as(37)dHdT∂T∂t=−∂qx∂x−∂qy∂y−∂qz∂z+QAnd,Meis consequently given by(38)Me=∫ΩedHdT[NTNzNTNz2NTNzNTNz2NTNz3NTNz2NTNz3NTNz4NTN]dΩLatent heat effect causes a large increase in the heat capacity in the mushy zone, between the liquidus (Tl) and solidus (Ts) temperatures of material, as shown in the scheme inFig. 5.The direct use of ceffon time integration process should be done with caution due to its step-like behavior. A node that is changing phase must be forced to attain a temperature value in the interval ΔT. If a node does not pass through this interval the latent heat effect is lost for that node, resulting in an incorrect energy balance and consequently incorrect temperatures. This may cause numerical oscillations, making difficult the solution convergence [14].There are several averaging techniques that overcome difficulties of the direct use of ceff. These averaging techniques are generally referred to as enthalpy method. A simple backward difference approximation is an averaging scheme that gives good results and is computationally fast [4,16,17]:(39)dHdT=ceff=Hn−Hn−1Tn−Tn−1This was the method used in this work.The welding arc can generally be modeled in two different ways: by prescribing the temperature in the weld or by specifying the heat input. In prescribed temperature techniques the temperature is given in the nodes inside an area or volume that simulates the weld pool. The prescribed temperature in the specific nodes is increased linearly up to the temperature considered necessary for melting the material, and is maintained at this value for a period of time [5]. This procedure is repeated in volumes along the weld bead for simulating the torch movement.The prescribed heat input method, which is the most commonly used method, can be applied in two most known ways: by a surface heat flux with gaussian distribution or a volumetric heat flux called Goldak׳s double ellipsoid. Pavelic was the first to suggest a gaussian distribution of heat flux applied on the surface of workpiece [1]. Friedman [18] and Krutz [19] extended this model to a moving heat source model by adapting Pavelic׳s disc for use in finite element applications (Fig. 6). It is computed as(40)q(x,y,t)=3Qπc2e−3x2/c2e−3[y+v(τ−t)]2/c2where x and y are system axes as shown in Fig. 6, v is the welding speed, c is the characteristic radius of heat flux distribution and τ is a lag factor that defines the position of the source at time t=0. Q is the power from the arc(41)Q=ηEIwhere η is the efficiency of the welding source, E is the arc voltage and I is the welding current.In order to consider the digging action of the arc, and also the high rate of heat transportation in the weld pool due to convection, Goldak proposed the double ellipsoid model, that distributes, in gaussian way, a power density (W/m3) in two combined ellipsoidal shapes [20]. The heat source is composed of a front half formed with a quadrant of an ellipsoid, and a rear half composed by a quadrant of another ellipsoid (Fig. 7). The power density distribution inside the front half is given by Eqs. (42) and (43) describes the power density in the rear half.(42)q(x,y,z,t)=63ffQabc1ππe−3x2/a2e−3y2/b2e−3[z+v(τ−t)]2/c12(43)q(x,y,z,t)=63frQabc2ππe−3x2/a2e−3y2/b2e−3[z+v(τ−t)]2/c22where ffand frare the fractions of heat deposited in the front and rear quadrants respectively, and must satisfy ff+fr=2. The ellipsoid parameters a, b, c1 and c2 correspond to dimensions of the weld pool and can be obtained from experimental data. In absence of these data it is possible to approximate the distance in front of heat source, c1, equal to one half weld width a and the distance behind source, c2, equal the double of weld width [20].The prescribed temperature technique is the simpler way to model the weld arc, but it can be less accurate than the heat flux model. Goldak׳s double ellipsoid is the most widely used model and, among the models presented, is what best describes the heat source. In this work the heat flux surface model with gaussian distribution was used, because it provides reasonably accurate results and is easier to implement than Goldak׳s model.An application example of the developed element is shown inFig. 8. An aluminum plate of 1mm thick is initially subjected in one of the edges to a linear temperature distribution through the thickness such that Ta=1000, Tb=2×106 and Tc=0. The other edges of the plate are kept at 0°C. This heating condition is maintained for 5s, and then the temperature imposition is removed from the hot side, causing the cooling of the plate. In this example the thermal properties were considered constant, making the problem linear: c=900J/kg°C, ρ=2700kg/m3 and k=237W/m°C. The initial plate temperature is 0°C and the convection coefficient h is zero on all surfaces. The mesh used in the spatial discretization was 20×20 elements.In this example the upper and lower surfaces are isolated, so there is rapid temperature equalization in thickness. The temperature histories at line located at y=250mm on points x=425mm, 450mm and 475mm is shown inFig. 9. At these points there is no difference between top and bottom temperatures because even for small time steps of the order 0.01s, Tbdecreases instantaneously to zero. There is a high temperature gradient near the hot edge, and from the graph it is observed that the temperature evolution in time becomes smoother as the point under analysis is far from the hot side. In the graph it is also possible to observe the natural tendency of stabilization and equalization of temperature until the entire plate is at 0°C.In this application example it is possible to observe the through-thickness temperature variation. A steel plate with 0.1×0.1×0.002m3 dimension, receives in the midline of the left side a thermal load of 50W equally distributed. The plate is heated for 5s and then is allowed to cool. The initial temperature as well as ambient temperature is 0°C, with h=40W/m2°C applied to all surfaces, except the left surface. The constant thermal properties considered were c=500J/kg°C, ρ=7800kg/m3 and k=40W/m°C. Elements near the hot edge have size 0.001×0.001m2, which gradually increases toward the cold side. The model mesh is illustrated byFig. 10.The temperature history for the thickness located at x=0m and y=0.05m is shown inFig. 11. This graph contains temperatures in three different points in the thickness: midplane (z=0m), top surface (z=0.001m) and in a point between these two planes (z=0.0005m). In this graph it is possible to observe a temperature difference up to 4°C. If we consider the symmetry of the problem, the difference between the upper and lower surfaces may reach 8°C. A rapid equalization of temperature through thickness is also noted when the heat input is removed.The graph ofFig. 12 shows the temperature history for the thickness located at x=0.001m and y=0.05m. In this region there is no significant variation of temperature through thickness.A computer code was developed with the new 2D element formulation for solving a transient nonlinear problem. The model was based on Depradeux [21] in order to compare the results of the new element with experimental results. In addition, a 3D model created in ANSYS was used to evaluate the through thickness temperature in comparison with the new element model. A plate of stainless steel AISI 316L with 0.250×0.160×0.010m3 is the part under analysis (Fig. 13).Considering the enthalpy definition in Eq. (35) the temperature–enthalpy curve (Fig. 14) was obtained with data of ρ(T) and c(T) used in Depradeux. As in Depradeux, the curve was linearly extrapolated up to the Tsolidustemperature and it is considered that above Tliquidusthe curve varies linearly with the same slope in the region before the Tsolidus.The temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is shown inFig. 15. For temperature above the melting point the value of thermal conductivity is doubled to consider fluid flow in weld pool. The convection heat transfer coefficient considered is 10W/m2°C and the ambient temperature 29°C. The radiative heat transfer was not accounted in this article. The consistent nodal loads resulting from the welding torch were accounted by gauss quadrature of the right term of Eq. (5), where the input heat function is described by Eq. (40) applied on top surfaces of elements located in the weld region. The welding parameters are E=10V, I=150A, η=0.68, v=0.001m/s. Based in the weld pool obtained by Depradeux the parameter c of Eq. (40) is equal to 6mm. The welding torch moves through time steps of 1s in both 2D and 3D models, starts at y=10mm and stops at y=240mm.The mesh used in the 2D model is shown inFig. 16. In the weld region the elements have 0.001×0.001m2 dimension and gradually increase to 0.01×0.001m2. Only one half of the plate was modeled because of symmetry.The 3D model has SOLID70 elements with 0.001×0.001×0.001m3 dimension in the weld region and 0.01×0.001×0.001m3 dimension in the cool edge.Fig. 17 shows the 3D ANSYS mesh. The latent heat was considered in the ANSYS software by inputting directly enthalpy–temperature curve points.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A formulation of a 2D heat transfer element with parabolic through-the-thickness temperature distribution was carried out. A 3D model of ANSYS thermal analysis was developed in parallel to compare the numerical results, focusing on the temperature distribution in the thickness. A numerical transient heat transfer analysis of a GTAW process was performed. Nonlinear properties of the steel and heat loss by convection were considered. Furthermore, experimental results obtained from the literature were used to validate the model. The 2D model with parabolic temperature variation in thickness showed a good correlation of results with the 3D model and the experimental data.Thermal analysis on plates where the through thickness temperature is important can be made more economically when using the 2D element described in this work. The plate discretization using 2D elements (12 degrees of freedom each) needs only one element in the thickness, while in the plate discretization with 3D elements (8 degrees of freedom each) is required more elements in the thickness direction.
