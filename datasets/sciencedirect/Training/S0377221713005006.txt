@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the Multi Trip Vehicle Routing Problem, in which a set of geographically scattered customers have to be served by a fleet of vehicles. Each vehicle can perform several trips during the working day. The objective is to minimize the total travel time while respecting temporal and capacity constraints.The problem is particularly interesting in the city logistics context, where customers are located in city centers. Road and law restrictions favor the use of small capacity vehicles to perform deliveries. This leads to trips much briefer than the working day. A vehicle can then go back to the depot and be re-loaded before starting another service trip.We propose an hybrid genetic algorithm for the problem. Especially, we introduce a new local search operator based on the combination of standard VRP moves and swaps between trips. Our procedure is compared with those in the literature and it outperforms previous algorithms with respect to average solution quality. Moreover, a new feasible solution and many best known solutions are found.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The well known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is anNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem where a set of geographically scattered customers has to be served by a fleet of vehicles. An implicit assumption of the VRP is that each vehicle can perform only one route in the planning horizon. This assumption is not realistic in several practical situations. For the distribution of goods in city centers, for example, small vehicles are generally preferred. Because of this capacity limitation, they daily perform several short tours. This problem is referred to as the Multi Trip VRP (also VRP with multiple use of vehicles, Taillard, Laporte, & Gendreau (1996), VRP with multiple trips, Petch & Salhi (2004) or VRP with multiple routes, Azi, Gendreau, & Potvin (2007)). In the rest of the paper it will be indicated as MTVRP.The MTVRP is defined on an undirected graph G=(V, E), where V={0,1,…,n} is the set of vertices and E={(i, j) ∣i, j∈V, i<j} is the set of edges. It is possible to travel from i to j, incurring in a travel time tij. Vertex 0 represents the depot where a fleet of m identical vehicles with limited capacity Q is based. Vertices 1,…,n represent the customers to be served, each one having a demand qi. A time horizon THexists, which establishes the duration of the working day. Overtime is not allowed. It is assumed that Q, qiand THare nonnegative integers.The MTVRP calls for the determination of a set of routes and an assignment of each route to a vehicle, such that the total travel time is minimized and the following conditions are satisfied:(a)each route starts and ends at the depot,each customer is visited by exactly one route,the sum of the demands of the customers in any route does not exceed Q,the total duration of the routes assigned to the same vehicle does not exceed TH.It is also supposed that each customer i could be served by a return trip, i.e, t0i+ti0⩽THand qi⩽Q.Few papers in the literature address the MTVRP and no efficient population-based algorithm were proposed. Our goal is to fill this gap proposing a memetic algorithm able to compete with previous works. Our interest in the MTVRP raises from the MODUM project,1http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/modum.1where mutualized distribution in city centers is explored. The contribution of this paper is threefold:(1)A high-performing memetic algorithm is proposed: the results found are the new state-of-the-art on classical instances for the MTVRP. Moreover, an instance has been solved for the first time, i.e., a feasible solution has been found.An adaptation of the Split procedure (Prins, 2004) to segment a chromosome into a MTVRP solution is developed.A new local search (LS) operator, that combines standard VRP moves and re-assignment of trips to vehicles is introduced.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the literature on the MTVRP is reviewed. Section 3 describes the proposed algorithm. Section 4 details the Combined LS. Results are reported in Section 5. Conclusions and perspectives are discussed in Section 6.
