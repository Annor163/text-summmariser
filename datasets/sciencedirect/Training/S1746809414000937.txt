@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next generation sequence technologies enable cost-efficient high resolution detection of DNA copy number variations (CNVs). However, while the CNVs estimates provided by different methods are often inconsistent with each other, still a little can be found about the estimation errors. Based on our recent studies of the confidence limits for stepwise signals measured in noise, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the confidence upper and lower boundary masks in order to guarantee an existence of genomic changes with required probability. We suggest combining these masks with estimates in order to give medical experts more information about true CNVs structures. Applications given for high-resolution CGH microarray measurements ensure that there is a probability that some changes predicted by an estimator may not exist.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a genome is commonly recognized to be essential for human life. The DNA is usually double-stranded, therefore the size of a gene or chromosome is often measured in base pairs. A unit of measurement is kilobase (kb) equal to 1000bp of DNA [1]. The DNA can demonstrate structural changes called copy-number variations (CNVs) associated with disease such as cancer [2]. The copy number variation (CNV) can be defined as a DNA segment of one kb or larger that is present at a variable copy number in comparison with a reference genome [3]. The human genome with 23 chromosomes is estimated to be about 3.2 billion base pairs long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct genes [2]. It is known [4] that each copy number variation (CNV) may range from about 1kb to several megabases (Mbs) in size. To detect the CNVs at a resolution level of 10–25kbs [5], the array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technique was developed employing chromosomal microarray analysis. Although it was reported that the high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations at resolution of 5kbs [6] and even 200bp [7], their regular resolution is still insufficient to detect short genomic changes. A progress was achieved in the last few years following the emergence of the next generation sequence (NGS) technologies which allows for the detection of CNVs with resolution <10kbp [8]. The NGS approach has generated extensive developments of the CNVs detection methods [9–12] and several such methods obtaining resolution of 0.8–6kb were recently reviewed in [13].Even though the conceptual steps in aCGH and CNV-seq methods are different, the outputs are typically represented in the same scales [9]. The genomic location is often given with the nth probes, n∈[1, M], where M is the number of probes following with a unit step ignoring “bad” or empty probes. The nlth discrete point corresponds to the ilth edge (breakpoint) in the genomic location scale in kb or Mb which is finally used to represent the CNVs. The breakpoints are placed as 0<n1<⋯<nL<M, where nl, l∈[1, L], is the lth breakpoint and L is the number of the breakpoints. The CNVs are represented with L+1 segmental constant changes aj, j∈[1, L+1], characterizing a segment between ij−1 and ijon an interval [ij−1, ij−1]. Typically, the CNVs are normalized as log2R/G=log2Ratio, where R and G are the fluorescent Red and Green intensities, respectively [14].Genome CNVs are stepwise sparse with a limited number of breakpoints [15]. The detected structure is usually contaminated by intensive noise [16]. In the log2Ratio scale, noise is commonly modeled as white Gaussian with equal or different segmental variances. Various statistical approaches have been developed in order to estimate CNVs in array CGH and NGS data. Two main goals are [17]: (1) to infer the number and statistical significance of the alterations and (2) to locate their boundaries accurately. A number of statistical methods were tested by CNVs measurements as observed in [18], including wavelet-based, robust, adaptive kernel smoothers, maximum likelihood (ML), penalized bridge estimator and ridge regression, fussed least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), the Schwarz information criterion-based estimator, and forward-backward smoothers. Quite comprehensive reviews of most common algorithms were given in [17,13].It has to be remarked now that, in view of large detection noise, no one estimator even ideal is able to provide a clear picture of genomic changes [17]: the estimates are often accompanied with large segmental errors and jitter in the breakpoints. Thus, medical experts may have insufficient information for a correct decision about the true CNVs structure [15]. Even so, still a little can be found in literature about the estimation errors, disregarding the fact that an existence of large jitter in the CNV breakpoints has been shown experimentally in [19]. The problem is complicated by the fact that exact jitter distribution is still unknown for such signals even in white Gaussian noise. Just recently, in [18,20], we have derived an approximate jitter distribution and showed that it obeys the discrete skew Laplace law.In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework and develop an efficient algorithm for computing the confidence lower boundary (LB) and upper boundary (UB) masks for CNVs. The masks proposed can be applied to measurements conducted by any technology, although we give applications only to high-resolution CGH (HR CGH) microarray data available from [21]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider a statistical model of genomic changers. A computational algorithm for the confidence UB and LB masks is developed in Section 3. Testing of some HR CGH microarray-based CNVs measurements by the confidence masks is given in Section 4. Discussions of segmental errors and jitter are provided in Section 5. Finally, concluding remarks can be found in Section 6.Estimation error bounds for genome DNA CNVs can be learned if to specify statistically noise in segments and jitter in the breakpoints [22]. Based upon the statistical properties of segmental noise and jitter in the breakpoints, the confidence UB and LB masks can be formalized for CNVs to exist with some probability. The masks, in turn, can serve as additional measures for experts to make decisions about possible genomic changes.A typical genomic change detected around the lth breakpoint at nlcan be illustrated as shown in Fig. 1a. One recognizes here two segments at levels aland al+1. In the log2Ratio scale, segmental noise is often supposed to be white [23] and modeled with Gaussian density [24](1)pl(x)=12πσl2exp−(x−al)22σl2in which the segmental noise variancesσl2along the genome can be different [15] as shown in Fig. 1b. In the presence of segmental noise, the breakpoint location cannot be predicted with unit probability. An estimator may find it several points to the left or to the right from a true location – thus jitter. We have shown in [18] that the jitter distribution measured in [19] can approximately be described with the discrete skew Laplace law [25] (Fig. 1c)(2)p(k|dl,ql)=(1−dl)(1−ql)1−dlqldlk,k≥0,ql|k|,k≤0,where dl=e−(κl/νl)∈(0, 1), ql=e−(1/κlνl)∈(0, 1),κl=(lnxl/(ln(xl/μl))), and νl=−(κl/lnxl)>0. Auxiliary functions connected with the probabilities for each detected point to belong to one segment or another are specified as(3)xl=ϕl(1+μl)2(1+ϕl)1−1+4μl(1−ϕl2)ϕl2(1+μl)2,(4)μl=PlA(1−PlB)PlB(1−PlA),(5)ϕl=PlA+PlB−1(1−2PlA)(1−2PlB),(6)PlA=1+12[erf(glβ)−erf(glα)],γl−<γl+,12erfc(g1α),γl−=γl+,12[erf(glβ)−erf(glα)],γl−>γl+,(7)PlB=12[erf(hlα)−erf(hlβ)],γl−<γl+,1−12erfc(hlα),γl−=γl+,1+12[erf(hlα)−erf(hlβ)],γl−>γl+,whereglβ=((βl−Δl)/|Δl|)(γl−/2),glα=((αl−Δl)/|Δl|)(γl−/2),hlβ=(βl/|Δl|)(γl+/2),hlα=(αl/|Δl|)(γl+/2), erf(x) is the error function, erfc(x) is the complementary error function, and(8)αl,βl=alγl−−al+1γl+γl−−γl+∓1γl−−γl+×(al−al+1)γl−γl++2Δl2(γl−−γl+)lnγl−γl+ifγl−≠γl+. Forγl−=γl+, set αl=Δl/2 and βl=±∞.The signal-to-noise rations (SNRs) in the lth and (l+1)th segments are specified as, respectively,(9)γl−=Δl2σl2,γl+=Δl2σl+12,where the segmental change is Δl=al+1−al.Distributions (1) and (2) suggest that due to segmental noise (Fig. 1a) there is always a probability (often high) of segmental errors (often large) and jitter in the breakpoints (sometimes essential) irrespective of the estimator used. Of prime interest is thus how much are these errors and which confidence limit masks guarantee an existence of genomic changes with sufficient probability.Let us suppose that the estimatenˆlof the lth breakpoint location is available. At least, it can be assigned visually. In view of white nature of noise, simple averaging applied on an interval ofNl=nˆl−nˆl−1points fromnˆl−1tonˆl−1gives the best estimate for the lth segmental levelaˆl=(1/Nl)∑v=nˆl−1nˆl−1yv, which mean value isE{aˆl}=aland varianceσˆl2=(σl2/Nl). Becauseσˆl2is commonly not negligible, segmental errors occur. The confidence UB and LB for segmental estimates can thus be specified in the ϑ-sigma sense as(10)aˆlUB≅aˆl+ɛ=aˆl+ϑσl2Nl=aˆl+ϑσˆl,(11)aˆlLB≅aˆl−ɛ=aˆl−ϑσl2Nl=aˆl−ϑσˆl,where ϑ indicates the bound wideness in terms ofσˆl. The probability ξ for the segmental estimate to exceed a threshold ɛ strongly depends on the segmental length Nland can be determined, using (1) andaˆl, asξ(Nl)=2∫al+ɛ∞pl(x)dx=erfc(μl(Nl/2)), where erfc(x) is the complementary error function andμl=(ɛ/σl2)is the normalized threshold. A distinctive feature of ξ is that it does not depend on the unknown al. By combining ɛ and μlin ξ(Nl) we getξ(Nl)=erfc(ϑ/2)and the confidence interval for segmental estimate becomesP(Nl)=1−ξ(Nl)=1−erfc(ϑ/2). Table 1gives several values of ϑ, P, and ξ for likely existing genomic changes (>50%). As can be seen, the 1-sigma sense (ϑ=1) occupies an intermediate position between the 50% probability (even chances) and 75% probability (probably existing changes). Herewith, the 2-sigma sense (ϑ=2) can be treated as typical or almost certainly existing changes and 3-sigma (ϑ=3) as certainly existing changes.By (2), the jitter left boundary (JLB)JlLand the jitter right boundary (JRB)JlRcan be defined with respect to the lth breakpointnˆlsimilarly to (10) and (11) as(12)JlL≅nˆl−klR,(13)JlR≅nˆl+klL,where(14)klR=νlκlln(1−dl)(1−ql)ξ(1−dlql),(15)klL=νlκlln(1−dl)(1−ql)ξ(1−dlql)correspond to the right (superscript “R”) and left (superscript “L”) jitter and ⌊x⌋ means a maximum integer lower than or equal to x. Functions (14) and (15) can easily be obtained by equating (2) to ξ and solving for kl. Here, we allow equal confidence intervals for segments and breakpoints.The confidence UB maskBnUand LB maskBnLcan now be formed by combining (10)–(13). The relevant algorithm is listed in Table 2. Its inputs are the detected CNVs yn, breakpoint locationsnˆl, bound wideness ϑ, number L of the breakpoints, and number of the probes M. At the output, it has two confidence masksBnUandBnL.The first algorithmic block (2–5) computes the segmental statisticsaˆjand σjon intervals between neighboring breakpoints. The second block (6–17) employs (1–5) to compute the right jitterklRand left jitterklL. The third block (18–22) finds the jitter boundariesClandDlfor the UB and LB masks. The fourth block (23–26) make corrections to jitter boundaries in the cases when some boundaries merge or overlap. The fifth block (27–33) skips some points in the case when the UB mask or LB mask occurs to be uniform for several breakpoints. The masksBnUandBnLfinally go to the output. Note that (2) approximates jitter in the breakpoints of CNVs in the lower bound sense. That means that wide jitter boundaries detected by the algorithm may be even wider in practice.Out next purpose is to test some detected CNVs by the algorithm developed in Table 2. We provide such a test in the 3-sigma sense suggesting that CNVs exist between the UB and LB masks with high probability of P=99.73%. Our studies are based on some HR-CGH array data which are available from the representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA) [21]. The breakpoint locations are also taken from [21]. Voluntary, we select data associated with potentially large jitter and large segmental errors. For clarity, we first compute some characteristics of detected CNVs and put them to tables. We notice that our segmental estimates found by averaging [22] are in a good correspondence with [21].The first database processed is a part of the 7th chromosome in archive “159A–vs–159D–cut” of ROMA. It is shown to have 14 segments and 13 breakpoints (Figs. 2 and 3). Below we shall show that, owing to large detection noise, there is a high probability that some breakpoints do not exist.Observe Fig. 3a and the characteristics collected in Table 3. Here, the only breakpoint which location can be estimated with high accuracy is i1. Jitter iniˆ6andiˆ7is moderate. All other breakpoints have large jitter. It is seen that the UB mask covering 2nd-to-6th segments is almost uniform. Thus, there is a probability that the 2nd-to-5th breakpoints do not exist. If to follow the LB mask, then locations of the 2nd-to-4th breakpoints can be predicted even with large errors. At least they can be supposed to exist. However, nothing definitive can be said about the 5th breakpoint and one may suppose that it does not exist. It is also hard to distinguish a true location of the 8th breakpoint. In Fig. 3b, i10, i12, and i13 are well detectable owing to large segmental SNRs. The breakpoint i9 has a moderate jitter. In turn, the location of i11 is unclear. Moreover, there is a probability that i11 does not exist.Another database processed corresponds to the 2nd chromosome in “159A–vs–159D–cut” of ROMA supposedly having 42 segments and 41 breakpoints. This case (Fig. 4) demonstrates large segmental errors when a segment is represented only with a few probes. In turn, only several breakpoints are accompanied here with large jitter. Some statistics of this chromosome are given in Table 4.Four specific regions of this chromosome associated with large segmental errors are sketched in Figs. 5 and 6. Even a quick look suggests that in almost all of the cases of short chromosomal changes the segmental errors reach tens of percents. Moreover, some segments cannot be estimated at all with a reasonable error. Thus, there is a probability that such changes do not exist. In fact, errors in the estimates of a4, a6, a14, a16, a25, a33, and a37 exceed 30%. A situation is even worse with a10, a12, a15, a18, a35, and a39, where the estimation errors reach (40–50)% – thus such estimates are not very useful. Furthermore, there are two segments a2 and a8 which levels cannot be estimated correctly and the question arises of their existence.Another specific of this chromosome is that a detected part around the breakpoint i19 does not contain enough information for experts. As a consequence, neither a19 nor i19 can be estimated with a reasonably small error. A bit better situation is with a31, i30, and i31. But there is not enough accuracy here as well and the predicted change associated with a31 may not exist.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Modern technologies such as NGS allow detecting genome changes with probe resolution of about 0.8–6kb in white Gaussian noise having segmental SNRs around unity. Under such conditions, estimates of segmental changes and breakpoint locations are often accompanied with large errors, especially if genome changes have about 1kb in length. In view of large noise, no one estimator even ideal is able to provide jitter-free detection of the breakpoint locations and error-free estimation of segmental changes.The confidence UB and LB masks proposed in this paper outline a region of the endpoints within which the CNVs estimates exist with a given probability. The masks can thus serve as an auxiliary tool for medical experts to make decisions about CNVs structures. The algorithm designed is able to produce the masks for any confidence interval. Testing some HR-CGH array data in the 3-sigma sense (confidence interval of 99.73%) has revealed errors of (30…50)% and larger in many segments. Jitter was also shown to be large in some breakpoints. Moreover, it was indicated that there is a probability that some changes predicted by ROMA may not exist. By reducing the confidential interval, the boundaries inherently squeeze around the predicted changes. However, the masks lose their usefulness when the confidential interval reaches 50%.Based upon this investigation, we end up with a conclusion that further works should be focused on optimizing the confidence interval in order to meet medical needs. Also, the algorithm should be combined with an efficient detector of the breakpoints. A special attention should be paid to mathematical justification of the probability that the detected breakpoint exists in the confidence masks. Finally, a more accurate approximation of the jitter distribution needs to be found as long as the discrete skew Laplace law does not fit the process well with small SNRs. We work on it now and expect presenting some results in near future.
