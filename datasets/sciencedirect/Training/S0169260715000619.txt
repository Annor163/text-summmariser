@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Gene Ontology (GO) is a structured repository of concepts (GO terms) that are associated to one or more gene products. The process of association is referred to as annotation. The relevance and the specificity of both GO terms and annotations are evaluated by a measure defined as information content (IC). The analysis of annotated data is thus an important challenge for bioinformatics. There exist different approaches of analysis. From those, the use of association rules (AR) may provide useful knowledge, and it has been used in some applications, e.g. improving the quality of annotations. Nevertheless classical association rules algorithms do not take into account the source of annotation nor the importance yielding to the generation of candidate rules with low IC. This paper presents GO-WAR (Gene Ontology-based Weighted Association Rules) a methodology for extracting weighted association rules. GO-WAR can extract association rules with a high level of IC without loss of support and confidence from a dataset of annotated data. A case study on using of GO-WAR on publicly available GO annotation datasets is used to demonstrate that our method outperforms current state of the art approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The production of experimental data in molecular biology has been accompanied by the accumulation of functional information about biological entities. Terms describing such knowledge are usually structured by using formal instruments such as controlled vocabularies and ontologies [1]. The Gene Ontology (GO) project [2] has developed a conceptual framework based on ontologies for organizing terms (namely GO terms) describing biological concepts. It consists of three ontologies: Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC) describing different aspects of biological molecules. Each GO term may be associated with many biological concepts (e.g. proteins or genes) by a process also known as annotation. The whole corpus of annotations is stored into publicly available databases, such as the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database [3].In such a way records representing the associations of biological concepts, e.g. proteins, and GO terms may be easily represented as {Pj, T1, …, Tn}, e.g. {P06727, GO:0002227, GO:0006810, GO:0006869} or {ApolipoproteinA-IV, innate immune response in mucosa, transport, lipid transport}. The whole set of annotated data represents a valuable resource for the existing approach of analysis. From those, the use of association rules (AR) [4–6] is less popular with respect to other techniques, such as statistical methods or semantic similarities [7]. Existing approaches span from the use of AR to improve the annotation consistency, as presented in [8], to the use of AR to analyze microarray data [9–14], (see [15] for a detailed review).As we pointed out in a previous work [5], the use of AR presents two main issues due to the Number and the Nature of Annotations [16]. The number of annotation is for each protein or gene is highly variable within the same GO taxonomy and over different species as we depict in Fig. 1. The variability is caused by two main facts: (i) The presence of different methods of annotations of data; and (ii) the use of different data sources.Regarding the Nature of Annotations, it should be evidenced that the association between a biological concept and its related GO term can be performed with 14 different methods. These methods are in general grouped into two broad categories: experimentally verified (or manuals) and Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). IEA annotations are usually derived using computational methods that analyze literature. Each annotation is labeled with an evidence code (EC) to keep track of the method used to annotate a protein with GO Terms. Manual annotations are, in general, more precise and specific than IEA ones (see [1]). Unfortunately, their number is lower, and the ratio among IEA versus non-IEA is variable (Fig. 2).Often many generic GO terms (this is particularly evident when considering novel or not well-studied genes) annotate genes and proteins, and the problem is also referred to Shallow Annotation Problem. The role of these general annotations is to suggest an area in which the proteins or genes operate. This phenomenon affects especially IEA annotations derived by using computational methods.Consequently, the application of classical AR methods to the analysis of annotated data may yield to the extraction of rules with low specificity, with generic terms or inconsistent annotations. An inconsistent annotation is defined following the true path rule: a rule contains an inconsistent annotation when it contains both a term t and its ancestors [8,5]. For these reasons, Faria et al. [8] proposed the manual filtering of ancestors and low specific terms using a definition of specificity in terms of descendants and ancestors. Nevertheless, the measurement of specificity of a single term following only topological information may yield to incorrect results as demonstrated by Alterovitz et al. [17]. Consequently, we here propose to select a more stringent definition of specificity by considering the information content (IC) of a term [18]. Methods for calculating IC fall into two classes: intrinsic approaches that estimate the IC of concepts by only considering structural information extracted from the ontology, and extrinsic approaches that measure the IC starting from annotated corpora. The main result of the use of IC is that it is possible to associate each GO term a measure of IC. The set of annotations and weights is referred to as the IC-weighted annotation set as represented in the following: {P06727, GO:0002227 (16.770), GO:0006810 (5.180), GO:0006869 (10.730)} where the numbers represent the IC of terms. For this reason, we may adapt some significant results of AR extraction that can deal with weighted attributes [19].We developed GO-WAR, i.e. Gene Ontology-based Weighted Association Rules Mining, a novel data-mining approach able to extract weighted association rules starting from an annotated dataset of genes or gene products. The proposed approach is based on the following steps: (i) initially we calculate the information content for each GO term; (ii) then, we extract weighted association rules by using a modified FP-Tree like algorithm able to deal with the dimension of classical biological datasets. We use publicly available GO annotation data to demonstrate our method. Results confirm that our method outperforms state of the art methods. We also provide a website containing the software tool, supplementary materials, and results https://sites.google.com/site/weightedrules/.The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses main related work, Section 3 discusses GO-WAR methodology and implementation, Section 4 presents results of the application of GO-WAR on a biological dataset. Finally Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future work.
