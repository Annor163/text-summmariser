@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In multi-criteria group decision making, a key issue is aggregating individual preference into group one. In this study, we employ a bilateral agreement to conduct group evaluation of alternatives. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. To express the relationship between the bilateral agreement and individual evaluations, the quasi-arithmetic mean is used, which can ensure the consistency property of the pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirements are explored to obtain the group preference, which shows that n−1 pairs of bilateral agreements are necessary. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multi-criteria group decision making has been applied in many areas, such as consumer purchasing selection, biotechnology management, evaluating weapon systems, assessing low carbon supply chains, etc. For example, a supply chain is composed of a lot of enterprises, each of which can be considered as a decision maker. A supply chain can be evaluated by several criteria, such as cost, quality, lead time and carbon emission. To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, enterprises should coordinate with each other, this process can be considered as a multi-criteria group decision making. A key problem in multi-criteria group decision making is how to aggregate the individual preference into the group one. Suitable aggregation operators should be selected in specific situations. For example, as a widely used technique to express the decision makers’ preference about alternatives or criteria (Dong, Hong, Xu, & Yu, 2013; Durbach, Lahdelma, & Salminen, 2014; Jalao, Wu, & Shunk, 2014; Liu, Zhang, & Zhang, 2014; Rezaei & Ortt, 2013; Zhü, 2014; Zhu & Xu, 2014), the pairwise comparison matrices have some properties, such as the reciprocity and the consistency. However, we should ensure that the pairwise comparison matrix after aggregation still retains the original property. Numerous researchers (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jiménez, & Salvador, 2010; Bernasconi, Choirat, & Seri, 2014; Dong, Zhang, Hong, & Xu, 2010; Liu, Zhang, & Wang, 2012; Xu, 2000) have investigated how to aggregate the pairwise comparison matrices. But they cannot provide a unified form and they always assume the weight vector is known for convenience. However, estimating the parameters of the aggregation functions is a key problem in decision making (Keeney & Kirkwood, 1975). Information on interpersonal comparisons is critical in solving this problem (González-Pachón & Romero, 2006; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976).Generally, there exist no aggregation operators, which do not violate some reasonable assumptions, such as the Arrow’s impossibility theorem (Arrow, 1963; Heil & Kuntz, 2005; Sen, 1970). One way to overcome this situation is to allow interpersonal comparisons of utility (Heil & Kuntz, 2005; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). Baucells and Shapley (2008) employed bilateral agreements between pairs of individuals to derive group utility. The process can be considered as preference disaggregation, which is based on the philosophy of assessing or inferring global preference models in accordance with the given preferential structures, as well as addressing decision-aiding activities (Ahn, 2010; Angilella, Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2014; Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013; Grigoroudis & Siskos, 2002; Huang, Chang, Li, & Lin, 2013; Huang, Liao, & Lin, 2009; Jacquet-Lagréze & Siskos, 2001; Srinivasan & Shocker, 1973). Baucells and Sarin (2003) extended the method proposed by Baucells and Shapley (2008) to multi-criteria decision making. However, their methods are only suitable for the weighted arithmetic mean, which does not ensure the consistency of the pariwise comparison matrix. Except for the weighted arithmetic mean, large families of other means exist (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Bullen, 2003), including weighted quasi-arithmetic mean, Gini mean, Bonferroni mean, Heronian mean, Generalized logarithmic mean, mean of Bajraktarevic, etc. However not all of them are monotone functions (e.g., some Gini means); thus, not all of them can be used as aggregation functions (Beliakov et al., 2007; Bullen, 2003).Following the preceding analysis, this paper focuses on aggregating pairwise comparison matrices based on bilateral agreements. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 investigates the relationship between consistency of pairwise comparison matrices and the aggregation functions, based on which we can find that the arithmetic mean is not always valid to keep the consistency property. Section 3 studies group decision making based on bilateral agreements, in which the quasi-arithmetic mean is employed. The advantage is that it can preserve the original property when we deal with group decision making based on pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirement is derived to obtain the group utility. Section 4 extends the method developed in Section 3 to deal with multi-criteria group decision making, in which the bilateral agreements could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. A bilateral agreement on one of the criteria is sufficient to derive the final group preference. Section 5 presents conclusions. The structure of this paper is illustrated in Fig. 1.Pairwise comparison matrices are popular and powerful techniques to model experts’ preferences in group decision making, and it mainly includes the reciprocal judgment matrix and the complementary judgment matrix, which can be defined as follows.For a set of alternatives (or criteria) X={x1, x2, …, xn}, a reciprocal judgment matrix (Saaty, 1980) defined on X is given as A=(aij)n×nwith the condition that aij∈(1/9, 9), aijaji=1, aii=1, i, j=1, 2, …, n. The element aijcan be interpreted as the preference of xiover xj: aij>1 implies that xiis strictly preferred to xj, whereas aij<1 expresses the opposite preference, and aij=1 means that xiand xjare indifferent. In addition, if(1)aij=aikakj,i,j=1,2,…,nthen A is consistent.A complementary judgment matrix (De Baets, De Meyer, De Schuymer, & Jenei, 2006; Tanino, 1984) defined on X is given as A=(aij)n×nwith the condition that aij∈(0, 1), aij+aji=1, aii=0.5, i, j=1, 2, …, n. The element aijcan be interpreted as the preference of xiover xj: aij>0.5 implies that xiis strictly preferred to xj, whereas aij<0.5 expresses the opposite preference and aij=0.5 means that xiand xjare indifferent. In addition, if(2)aij=aik+akj-0.5,i,j=1,2,…,nthen A is additive consistent. If(3)aij=aikakj/(aikakj+(1-aik)(1-akj)),i,j=1,2,…,nthen A is multiplicative consistent.It is noted that the aforementioned three types of consistencies have a general form that can be described as(4)aij=f-1(f(aik)+f(akj)),i,j=1,2,…,nwhere f(t) is a continuous strictly monotone function. Especially, if f(t)=log t, then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (2); if f(t)=t−0.5, then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (1); if f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (3). Therefore, the consistency of pairwise comparison matrix can be unified in a general framework expressed by Eq. (4).In group decision making, if each provided pairwise comparison matrix is consistent, then we expect the final group matrix to be consistent as well; the aggregation operator that ensures such property is what we look for. Numerous aggregation operators have been employed to aggregate the pairwise comparison matrices; the weighted arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are the two most common operators (Altuzarra et al., 2010; Bernasconi et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Xu, 2000). Since the quasi-arithmetic mean (Dujmović, 1974; Fishburn, 1970) generalizes the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean, we expect it to provide a unified aggregation form as follows.For a collection of consistent pairwise comparison matricesA(l)=(aij(l))n×n,l=1,2,…,m, with the weight vector λ=(λ1, λ2, …, λm)T such that∑l=1mλl=1and λl⩾0, l=1, 2, …, m, we define their aggregation as A=(aij)n×n, where(5)aij=f-1∑l=1mλlf(aij(l)),i,j=1,2,…,nis obtained by using the quasi-arithmetic mean.Theorem 1A is consistent if and only if A(l)are all consistent.The proof of Theorem 1 is provided in Appendix A.Theorem 1 shows that Eq. (5) can preserve the consistency property of the pairwise comparison matrix after aggregation. Especially, if f(t)=t−0.5 or f(t)=t, then Eq. (5) is reduced toaij=∑l=1mλlaij(l),i,j=1,2,…,nwhich is the well-known weighted arithmetic mean (Harsanyi, 1955). This mean is good for averaging inputs that can be added together. It is suitable for aggregating the additive consistent complementary judgment matrices.If f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), then Eq. (5) is reduced toaij=∏l=1m(aij(l))λl∏l=1maij(l)λl+∏l=1m1-aij(l)λl,i,j=1,2,…,nwhich is the uninorms introduced by Yager and Rybalov (1996), and studied by Fodor, Yager, and Rybalov (1997). It is an associative aggregation function that presents conjunctive behavior when dealing with low input values, has disjunctive behavior for high values and is averaging otherwise. It plays an interesting and important role not only in theoretical investigations but also in practical applications, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy system modeling, fuzzy logic, etc. (DeBaets & Fodor, 1999; Golan, 1992; Hájek, Havránek, & Jiroušek, 1992; Yager & Rybalov, 1996). It is suitable for aggregating the multiplicative consistent complementary judgment matrices.If f(t)=log t, then Eq. (5) is reduced toaij=∏l=1m(aij(l))λl,i,j=1,2,…,nwhich is the weighted geometric mean (Aczél & Saaty, 1983). The inputs of the weighted geometric mean are not added but multiplied. For example, when the rates of investment return are averaged over several years, the use of the arithmetic mean is incorrect. The reason is that the rate of return (say 0%) signifies that in one year the investment was multiplied by a factor 1. If the return is 300% in the next year, then the total is multiplied by 4, which means that the original investment is multiplied by a factor of 1×4. The average return is calculated by using the geometric mean of 1 and 4, which gives 2, but not the arithmetic mean of 1 and 4, that is 2.5. It can be used to aggregate the consistent reciprocal judgment matrices.Based on the above analysis, we can find that the quasi-arithmetic mean not only can provide a unified technique for aggregating pairwise comparison matrices, but can also preserve the consistency property of the aggregated pairwise comparison matrix. Therefore, quasi-arithmetic mean can be considered as a suitable aggregation function in aggregating pairwise comparison matrices.In the problem discussed in Section 2, the individual information and the relative weights between them are known, based on which we can obtain the group information easily by using the linear aggregation function or non-linear aggregation function according to the specific situations. However, determining the values of the parameters of the aggregation function is a key problem in decision making (Keeney & Kirkwood, 1975). Information about interpersonal comparisons is crucial to answering this question (González-Pachón & Romero, 2006; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). Baucells and Sarin (2003) assumed that individuals are willing to perform interpersonal comparisons, and bilateral agreements between pairs of individuals are sufficient to derive the parameters of the aggregate utility function. However, they used the weighted arithmetic mean to aggregate the individual preference, which does not ensure the consistency of the aggregated pairwise comparison matrix, as discussed in Section 2.In this section, we use quasi-arithmetic means to discuss how to derive group utility when every decision maker provides his/her individual utility, and some pairs of individuals may provide their joint utilities (or their bilateral agreements). It should be noted that a complete preference for a pair is called a bilateral agreement (Baucells & Sarin, 2003; Baucells & Shapley, 2008). For example, two individuals who attach different importance weights to a criterion are asked to compromise and provide an agreement on their common weight for the criterion, then the bilateral agreement can be obtained.In fact, to test the willingness to compromise, Heil and Kuntz (2005) studied large capital investment decisions of the executive team of 35 German hospitals, which suggests that it is sufficient to seek compromise among pairs in group decisions, i.e., it is not required for a rational group decision that all group members unanimously agree. This is important since unanimous agreement might hardly be reached in practice. Thus, their empirical findings support the theory presented by Baucells and Sarin (2003) and Baucells and Shapley (2008).Let S be a set, any two disjoint collations A and B, S=A∪B, A∩B=Φ, uAand uBdenotes the utility of A and B, respectively, where uA, uB∈[a, b] and 0<a<b. Then, we assume the bilateral agreement of A and B denoted by uA∪Btakes the form of the quasi-arithmetic mean (Dujmović, 1974; Fishburn, 1970) of uAand uBas follows:(6)uA∪B=f-1αf(uA)+(1-α)f(uB),α∈(0,1)In Eq. (6), uA, uBand uA∪Bare known. Thus, we can obtain the value of the parameter α, which can be considered as the relative importance between A and B. In commonly used decision making models, uA, uBand α are assumed to be known, from which we can obtain the joint utility uA∪Bby using some aggregation operators. Eq. (6) actually provides us an inverse study on decision making. Especially, if f(t)=t and uA, uB∈[0,1], then Eq. (6) reduces to the one proposed by Baucells and Shapley (2008).Considering two individuals i and j who are endowed with utility functions uiand uj, respectively. Then the bilateral agreement uijof i and j can be given as:(7)uij=f-1f(ui)+δijf(uj)1+δijwhere δij=(1−αij)/αijis called the “utility comparison ratio” between i and j with αij∈(0, 1), and f: (a, b)→(−∞, +∞) is a continuous strictly monotone function, that we call a generating function.In addition, we can find that each bilateral agreement uijproduces a comparison ratio δij. The bilateral agreement between i and j is the same as that between j and i, that is uij=uji, from which, we can obtain δji=1/δij.Based on the preceding analysis, we can find that the bilateral agreement uijis actually the group utility of individuals i and j, which means that obtaining the group utility is easy when there are only two individuals in a group. But if three individuals exist and two pairs of them provide their bilateral agreements, how can the group utility be obtained? The following theorem provides the answer.For a set of individuals N={1, 2, …, n} with their utilities {u1, u2, …, un}, for any three individuals {i, k, j}, the bilateral agreement between individuals i and k yields uik, and the individuals k and j yields ukj. The corresponding comparison ratios are δikand δkj, respectively.Theorem 2The group utility of individuals {i, k, j} can be represented by(8)uikj=f-1f(ui)+δikf(uk)+δijf(uj)1+δik+δijwhere δijcan be considered as the comparison ratio between individuals i and j with the condition that δij=δikδkj.The proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Appendix A.Theorem 2 illustrates that to obtain the group utility of any three individuals {i, k, j}, we only need to know the utility of each individual, and the bilateral agreements of any two pairs of these three individuals. The condition δij=δikδkj, i, j, k=1, 2, …, n should be satisfied.By comparing Eqs. (7) and (8), we can find that their forms are similar. Is it extended to derive the group utility of n(n>3) individuals? What is the minimum requirement under such situation? Before answering these questions, we first provide the following theorem.Theorem 3The group utility of individuals {i, i+1, i+2, …, i+q} can be represented by:(9)ui,i+1,i+2,…,i+q=f-1f(ui)+δi,i+1f(ui+1)+δi,i+2f(ui+2)+⋯+δi,i+qf(ui+q)1+δi,i+1+δi,i+2+⋯+δi,i+qwhere {i, i+1, i+2, …, i+q}, q<n is any q+1 individuals in N={1, 2, …, n}; δi, i+1, δi, i+2, …, δi, i+qare the comparison ratios that correspond to the bilateral agreements ui, i+1, ui, i+2, …, ui, i+q.The proof of Theorem 3 is provided in Appendix A.Theorem 3 shows that to obtain the group utility of q+1 individuals, we only need to know the individual utilities of these q+1 individuals, and the bilateral agreements of q pairs of individuals.Based on Theorem 3, the following corollary can be obtained:Corollary 1The group utility of individuals {1, 2, …, n} can be represented by(10)u12⋯n=f-1f(u1)+δ12f(u2)+⋯+δ1nf(un)1+δ12+⋯+δ1nNoted that all δij, i, j=1, 2, …, n, can construct a matrix δ=(δij)n×nwith the condition that δij=δikδkj, and δji=1/δij. We can find that δ=(δij)n×nis a consistent reciprocal judgment matrix defined bySaaty (1980), who has shown that by providing only n−1 pairs of comparisons that can construct a spanning tree ST on a set of n individuals, we can estimate a consistent and complete reciprocal judgment matrix. Other values can be obtained by usingδij=∏pq∈STijδpq, where STijdenotes the collection of pairs in the unique path between i and j in ST. Then let λ1=1 andλi=δ1i=∏pq∈ST1iδpq, where ST1idenotes the collection of pairs in the unique path between 1 and i in ST, then Eq.(10)can be written as:(11)u12⋯n=f-1∑i=1nλif(ui)∑i=1nλiEspecially, if f(t)=t and ui∈[0, 1], then the method proposed in this section reduces to the one presented byBaucells and Shapley (2008).In the following, we use an example to illustrate the proposed method.Example 1For a set of alternatives Y={y1, y2, y3}, three individuals dl, l=1, 2, 3 provide their reciprocal judgment matricesA(l)=(aij(l))3×3,l=1,2,3, whereA(1)=1431/413/41/34/31,A(2)=128/51/214/55/85/41,A(3)=1841/811/21/421which are all consistent. Then, their group should also be consistent. For the degree that y1 prefers to y3, individuals d1 and d2 provide a bilateral agreement u12=2, and individuals d1 and d3 provide a bilateral agreement u13=3.5. Based on these bilateral agreements, the relative weights of these three individuals can be derived. If we use Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method, let f(t)=t, then by Eq. (7), we have δ12=2.5000 and δ13=1.0000, and by Eq. (10), we can obtain the following matrix:A′=1.00003.77782.44440.36111.00000.72220.47691.43521.0000which is not a reciprocal judgment matrix, sincea12′a21′=1.3642≠1.Instead, if we use the proposed method, let f(t)=log t. By Eq. (7), we have δ12=1.8171 and δ13=1.1544, and by Eq. (10), we obtain the group reciprocal judgment matrix:A=1.00003.56332.44650.28061.00000.68660.40871.45651.0000which is consistent.In Appendix A, we provide Example 2 for another comparison.Examples 1 and 2 show that assuming the bilateral agreement as the weight arithmetic mean of the individual preference values is not always valid. The preference values do not exist in isolation, but belongs to a team which has its own character. This means that the individual preference value has some relationship with other preference values in the team, such as the reciprocal and consistency properties in a comparison matrix. Therefore, when dealing with the relationship between the bilateral agreements and the individual preference values, we should also consider the characters of the team that the individual preference values belong to.We now examine the case where the consequence of a decision is evaluated on multiple criteria. We assume that the members of the group have agreed on the criteria c1, c2, …, cmand each individual can specify his/her own utility function for these criteria. An arbitrary multidimensional consequence is denoted by x=(x1, x2, …, xm), andxa∗andxa0are, respectively, the most preferred and least preferred consequences on criterion a that are agreed upon by all individuals.Based on the quasi-arithmetic mean, the utility function of each individual over criteria can be written as:(12)ui=f-1∑a=1mβi,af(vi,a),i=1,2,…,nwhere βi,ais the weight that individual i attaches to criterion a with the condition that 0<βi,a<1,∑a=1mβi,a=1, and vi,ais individual i′s utility function (criteria evaluation function) for criterion a.To obtain the group utility, individuals i and j can give bilateral agreements on the weights of criteria or the evaluation of alternative under criteria. Let uijbe the bilateral agreement between uiand uj, and δij=(1−αij)/αijbe the comparison ratio with αij∈(0,1), then uijcan be expressed as the quasi-arithmetic mean of uiand uj. Let vij,abe the bilateral agreement between vi,aand vj,a, and δij,a=(1−αij,a)/αij,abe the comparison ratio with αij,a∈(0,1). Then vij,acan be expressed as the quasi-arithmetic mean of vi,aand vj,a. Let βij,abe the bilateral agreement between βi,aand βj,a, with the condition that∑a=1mβij,a=1.Theoretically, the final comparison ratio should be the same regardless of the types of the bilateral agreements provided by the individuals. Following this guideline, certain relationships exist between the bilateral agreements and other parameters.Theorem 4The relationship between parameters δij, αij, δij,a, αij,a, βj,a, βi,aand βij,acan be given by(13)δij,a=βj,aβi,aδij,βij,a=βi,aαij+βj,a(1-αij)The proof of Theorem 4 is provided in Appendix A.Theorem 4 shows that if the values of some parameters are known, others can also be determined. Therefore, the minimum requirements can be derived to obtain the group utility. For example, we only need to know the comparison ratio δij,aunder criterion a to obtain the overall comparison ratio δijbetween individuals i and j from Eq. (13).In the following sections, three methods are presented to determine the values of these parameters, based on which the group utility can be further obtained.For a given pair of individuals i and j, and some choice of a criterion a, let vi,aand vj,abe the corresponding criteria evaluation functions. Individuals i and j provide a bilateral agreement vij,a, which can be expressed as the quasi-arithmetic mean about vi,aand vj,a:(14)vij,a=f-1αij,af(vi,a)+(1-αij,a)f(vj,a)From which, we can obtain the comparison ratio δij,aof individuals i and j for criterion a:(15)δij,a=f(vi,a)-f(vij,a)f(vij,a)-f(vj,a)Based on Eq. (13), the comparison ratio δijof individuals i and j can be obtained:(16)δij=βi,af(vi,a)-f(vij,a)βj,af(vij,a)-f(vj,a)Method I shows that we only need to know the bilateral agreement of two individuals on evaluation about one criterion to obtain the comparison ratio of these two individuals.To illustrate the proposed method, the following example is provided.Example 3(Baucells & Sarin, 2003). The three criteria x=(x1, x2, x3) of an alternative may represent a monetary outcome (a discounted cash flow, for instance) x1, some indicator of environmental impact x2, and some measure of health and safety x3. Suppose (0.4, 0.35, 0.25) is the set of weights of criteria of individual 1, (0.5, 0.3, 0.2) is the set of weights of criteria of individual 2, and both individuals have the same utility functions on the last two criteria and slightly different on the first criterion. Let x0 be the worst outcome and x∗ the best one.Suppose that we use the quasi-arithmetic mean to aggregate the individual utilities. By Eq. (12), if f(t)=t, then the proposed method reduces to the one proposed by Baucells and Sarin (2003); if f(t)=log t, then the individual utilities are separable in the following criteria evaluation functions:u1(x)=1-e-x1/1001-e-10.4×x21000.35×x31000.25u2(x)=1-e-x1/2001-e-1/20.5×x21000.3×x31000.2To elicit a bilateral agreement applying Method I, we choose the monetary criterion x1 and let x1=40. Thus, the evaluation value of individuals 1 and 2 about criterion x1 is given as v1,1=0.52, v2,1=0.46. Now, individuals 1 and 2 elicit a bilateral agreement on the first criterion by finding a bilateral agreements v12,1∈(0.46, 0.52), say v12,1=0.51.If f(t)=log t, then by Eq. (15), we can obtain δ12,1=0.1584. From Eq. (16), we can derive δ12=0.1267. If f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), then by Eq. (15), we can obtain δ12,1=0.1998. From Eq. (16), we can derive δ12=0.1598.For a given pair of individuals i and j, and some choice of a criterion a, let βi,aand βj,abe the corresponding criteria weights given to criterion a. We ask individuals i and j to provide a bilateral agreement βij,a. Then by Eq. (13), we know βij,acan be expressed as the weighted arithmetic mean of βi,aand βj,a, that is:βij,a=αijβi,a+(1-αij)βj,awhich derives the comparison ratio between individuals i and j:(17)δij=βi,a-βij,aβij,a-βj,aMethod II presents a way to derive the value of the comparison ratio from the bilateral agreement on one criterion weight.In Example 3, individuals 1 and 2 could use Method II to compare the weights given to certain criteria, for example, a=2. In this case, β1,2=0.35 and β2,2=0.3 are the weights given to criterion 2, and a bilateral agreement is β12,2∈(0.3, 0.35). If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one in Method I obtained for f(t)=log t, then β12,2=0.3444. By Eq. (17), we obtain δ12=0.1267. If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one in Method I obtained for f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), then β12,2=0.3417. By Eq. (17), we have δ12=0.1598.One interesting thing in the multi-criteria decision making is the willingness to pay, which means decreasing the performance of one criterion to increase the performance of another criterion. However, the overall value of the alternative should not be changed, which can be described as follows (Baucells & Sarin, 2003):Letx1ibe individual i′s willingness to pay for criterion 1 to increase criterion 2 fromx20tox2∗. Then alternatives(x1i,x20,x3,…,xn)and(x10,x2∗,x3,…,xn)should have the same overall values. Canceling the terms involving x3, …, xn, we can obtain(18)βi,1f(vi,1(x1i))+βi,2f(vi,2(x20))=βi,1f(vi,1(x10))+βi,2f(vi,2(x2∗))Ifx1i≠x1j, then we can ask individuals i and j to reach a compromise and seek a pair trade offx1ij∈(x1i,x1j), which makes sure that the overall value of alternative(x1ij,x20,x3,…,xn)should be equivalent to the overall value of alternative(x10,x2∗,x3,…,xn). Since uijcan be written as the quasi-arithmetic mean of uiand uj, and canceling the terms involving x3, …, xn, we can obtainαijβi,1f(vi,1(x1ij))+βi,2f(vi,2(x20))+(1-αij)βj,1f(vj,1(x1ij))+βj,2f(vj,2(x20))=αijβi,1f(vi,1(x10))+βi,2fi,1(vi,2(x2∗))+(1-αij)βj,1f(vj,1(x10))+βj,2f(vj,2(x2∗))Combing Eq. (18), the comparison ratio can be derived:(19)δij=βi,1[f(vi,1(x1i))-f(vi,1(x1ij))]βj,1[f(vj,1(x1ij))-f(vj,1(x1j))]Method III provides us another method to derive the comparison ratio of two individuals, which is based on the willingness to pay.In Example 3, letxa0=25andxa∗=75,a=1,2,3, then we begin finding the monetary outcomes that individuals 1 and 2 are willing to pay to move x2 from its worst levelx20, to its best levelx2∗. Suppose alternativex1i,x20,x3and alternativex10,x2∗,x3have the same overall value. If f(t)=log t, then we determine thatx11=86.38133andx12=51.53532by Eq. (18). Now a bilateral agreement takes the form of a compromise in this willingness to pay,x112∈(51.53532,86.38133). If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one obtained for f(t)=log t, thenx112=79.0076. By Eq. (19), we can obtain δ12=0.1267. If f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), then we determine thatx11=68.73363andx12=55.31521by Eq. (18). Now a bilateral agreement takes the form of a compromise in this willingness to pay,x112∈(55.31521,68.73363). If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one obtained for f(t)=log(t/(1−t)), thenx112=66.66599. By Eq. (19), we can obtain δ12=0.1598.Based on the aforementioned methods, the values of comparison ratios can be obtained, from which we can derive the group utility of n individuals based on the methods given in Section 3:Theorem 5Let λ1=1, λi=δ1i, i=2, 3, …, n, then group preference is represented by(20)f(uN)=f(u12⋯n)=∑i=1nλif(ui)∑i=1nλiAlternatively, the group utility is equally represented byf(uN)=∑a=1mβaf(va), where each βacan be considered as the group weight for criterion a given byβa=∑i=1nλiβi,a/∑i=1nλi, and vacan be considered as the group evaluation for criterion a given byf(va)=∑i=1nλiβi,af(vi,a)/∑i=1nλiβi,a. InExample 3, if f(t)=log t, δ12=0.1267, then based onTheorem 5, we have λ1=1, λ2=δ12=0.1267. By Eq.(20), we can obtain the group utility:u12(x)=u1(x)0.8875u2(x)0.1125Actually, the proposed method is a generalization of the one proposed byBaucells and Sarin (2003). The former is based on the quasi-arithmetic mean, while the latter is based on the weighted arithmetic mean, which is a special case of the quasi-arithmetic mean. Next, an example is provided to compare the proposed method with the one provided byBaucells and Sarin (2003).For three alternatives Y={y1, y2, y3}, two individuals dl, l=1, 2 provide the pairwise comparison matrices of them under three criteria C={c1, c2, c3}, given byAk(l), which denotes that individual dlprovides the reciprocal judgment matrices about these three alternatives under criterion ck, k=1, 2, 3.A1(1)=11/23/22132/31/31,A2(1)=11/45/44154/51/51,A3(1)=11/31/2313/222/31A1(2)=11/52/55125/21/21,A2(2)=11/222141/21/41,A3(2)=13/49/44/3134/91/31The weight vector of the criteria provided by these two individuals are w(1)=(0.1, 0.4, 0.5)T and w(2)=(0.2, 0.5, 0.3)T, respectively. AsAk(l),l=1,2,k=1,2,3are all consistent, their collective one should also be consistent.The method proposed by Baucells and Sarin (2003) is firstly used to derive the group reciprocal judgment matrix. Let f(t)=t, then by Method I, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement between 1/2 and 1/5 for the preference value that alternative y1 is preferred to alternative y2 under criterion c1. Suppose the bilateral agreement is 1/3, then by Eqs. (15) and (16), we can obtain δ12=1.25.If Method II is used, then individuals 1 and 2 provide a bilateral agreement between 0.1 and 0.2 for the weight of criterion c2. If it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the bilateral agreement be 0.1556. By Eq. (17), we have δ12=1.25, and by Eq. (12), we can obtain the overall reciprocal judgment matrices of individuals dl, l=1, 2, respectively, as follows:A′(1)=1.00000.31670.90003.30001.00003.05001.38670.44671.0000,A′(2)=1.00000.51501.75502.40001.00003.30000.88330.32501.0000By Eq. (20), the group matrix is derived asA′=1.00000.42691.37502.8001.00003.18891.66260.37911.0000we can find that A′ is not a reciprocal judgment matrix, because that a12a21=1.1953≠1.Instead, the proposed method is employed to obtain the group reciprocal judgment matrix. By Method I, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement on the preference value that alternative y1 is preferred to alternative y2 under criterion c1, that is 1/3. Let f(t)=log t, by Eqs. (15) and (16), we obtain δ12=0.7937.Alternatively, if Method II is used, these two individuals give a bilateral agreement on the weight of criterion c2. If it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the compromise weight of criterion c2 be 0.1442. By Eq. (17), we have δ12=0.7937, and by Eq. (12), we obtain the overall reciprocal judgment matrices of individuals dl, l=1, 2, respectively.A(1)=1.00000.30940.80513.23211.00002.60221.24210.38431.0000,A(2)=1.00000.47011.50172.12711.00003.19430.66590.31311.0000By Eq. (20), the group reciprocal judgment matrix is derived asA=1.00000.37231.06082.68591.00002.84930.94270.35101.0000which is consistent.In Appendix A, we provide Example 5 for another comparison.Based on the preceding analysis, we can find that when the decision makers provide multiplicative consistent complementary judgment matrices and consistent reciprocal judgment matrices, and provide also their bilateral agreements, if we use Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method, or Baucells and Sarin (2003)’s method, the obtained group pairwise comparison matrix is not consistent. If the decision makers provide the consistent reciprocal judgment matrices, the group matrix obtained by using Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method, or Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method is not a reciprocal judgment matrix. Such problems can be solved by using the proposed methods.In this paper, the multi-criteria group decision making has been investigated based on bilateral agreements. To ensure the consistency of pairwise comparison matrices, qusi-arithmetic mean has been used to provide a unified aggregation function. To explore the group preference based on different pairwise comparison matrices, the bilateral agreement between each pair of them is employed. The minimum requirement has been investigated to obtain the group utility. The bilateral agreements among pairs of individuals on a single criterion were found to be sufficient to derive the multi-criteria group utility. The bilateral agreements between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of these three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. Several examples have also been presented to illustrate the proposed methods. In future research, the multi-criteria group decision making problem, in which the criteria are correlated with each other, will be investigated.
