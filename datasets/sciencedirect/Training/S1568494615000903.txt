@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the past, approaches often generalized classical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods under fuzzy environment to solve fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) problems and encompass decision-making messages uncertainty and vagueness. These MCDM methods included analytic hierarchy process (AHP), simple additive weighting method (SAW), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), etc. In the MCDM methods, SAW is a famous method that is applied in fuzzy environment, but fuzzy multiplication is a drawback to generalize SAW under fuzzy environment. To resolve the multiplication drawback, we utilize a relative preference relation that is from fuzzy preference relation in fuzzy generalized SAW. Generally, fuzzy preference relation is an option to reserve lots of messages. However, pair-wise comparison for fuzzy preference relation is complex on operation. Through the description above, the relative preference relation is improved form fuzzy preference relation to avoid comparing fuzzy numbers on pair-wise and reserving fuzzy messages. Through the relative preference relation, we can generalize SAW under fuzzy environment. It is said that we propose a FMCDM model based on SAW and the relative preference relation to easily and quickly solve FMCDM problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision-making is an essential issue for enterprises to find the best alternative from feasible alternatives. Practically, decision-making with several evaluation criteria is multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) [1–5,8,10,11,15,17–26,29–38,40]. A MCDM model is presented in matrix format as follows.G=C1C2⋯CnA1A2⋮AmG11G21⋯G1nG21G22⋯G2n⋮⋮⋯⋮Gm1Gm2⋯GmandW=W1,W2,...,Wn,where A1, A2, ..., Amare feasible alternatives, C1, C2, ..., Cnare evaluation criteria, Gijis the evaluation rating of Aion Ci, and Wjis the weight of Cj.The previous approaches commonly classify MCDM problems into two components. One is classical MCDM problems [3,11,15,19,22,31,40] and the other is fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) problems (i.e. MCDM problems under fuzzy environment) [1,2,4,5,8,10,17,18,20,21,23–26,29,30,32–38]. In the classical MCDM problems, evaluation ratings and criteria weights are assessed under certain environment and presented by crisp values. On the other hand, evaluation ratings and criteria weights in FMCDM problems are measured on imprecision, subjectivity or vagueness, so that ratings and weights are displayed by linguistic terms [12,16] and then transferred into fuzzy numbers [39,41,42]. Evaluation ratings are indicated by very poor (VP), poor (P), medium poor (MP), fair (F), medium good (MG), good (G) and very good (VG). Criteria weights are denoted as very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (VH). The terms above can be converted into fuzzy number. Practically, a problem with several criteria evaluated by linguistic terms is a FMCDM problem.Through defuzzification or fuzzy generalization, researchers generalized classical MCDM methods under fuzzy environment to solve FMCDM problems. The classical MCDM methods included analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [31], simple additive weighting method (SAW) [11], technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [19], etc. Since defuzzification loses fuzzy messages, fuzzy generalization [5,10,26,30,34–38] is superior to defuzzification on reserving messages. In the classical MCDM methods, SAW proposed by Churchman, Ackoff and Amoff [11] is a well-known method. However, applying SAW under fuzzy environment to solve FMCDM problems [10] was difficult due to fuzzy multiplication. In SAW, evaluation criteria ratings multiplied by corresponding weights are weighted ratings, and the weighted ratings within an alternative are aggregated into the alternative evaluation index. Finally, all alternative evaluation indices are ranked to find the best alternative. In fuzzy generalized SAW, fuzzy multiplication, aggregation and ranking may be critical based on the SAW computations. The complexity and difficulty of fuzzy computations [30,38], especially for fuzzy multiplication, are presented as follows.In fuzzy generalized SAW, Wei et al. [38], as well as Raj and Kumar [30] multiplied two triangular/trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by extension principle [39,41,42] into a pooled fuzzy number that is not a triangular/trapezoidal fuzzy number. The pooled fuzzy number represents a weighted criterion rating, and weighted ratings within an alternative are aggregated into the alternative evaluation index. Wei et al. [38] used inverse functions to derive the representations of all alternative evaluation indices. On the other hand, Raj and Kumar utilized maximizing and minimizing sets [6] to yield the representations of all alternative evaluation indices. Multiplying triangular fuzzy numbers or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers into a pooled fuzzy number is hard, so are aggregation and ranking [26,30,38] of pooled fuzzy numbers. Therefore, SAW is seldom generalized under fuzzy environment to solve FMCDM problems [10,30,38].To resolve ties above, we propose a FMCDM model based on SAW and relative preference relation. The relative preference relation is from Lee's [24,25] fuzzy preference relation. In the past, two related SAW approaches including Fan, Ma and Zhang [14], as well as Modarres and Sadi-Nezhad [28] applied preference ratio/information under fuzzy environment. However, the two approaches were unlike our proposed model in practice. Fan et al.’s approach was derived from the approach of Ma et al. [27]. The method yielded fuzzy preference information for MCDM in crisp values, whereas our model's relative preference relation is applied in FMCDM (i.e. MCDM under fuzzy environment). Modarres and Sadi-Nezhad used preference ratio to rank fuzzy numbers prior to any fuzzy arithmetic in the method. On the other hand, our model is based on SAW and relative preference relation to avoid ranking pooled fuzzy numbers. In addition, they utilized area integration to define a fuzzy number's preference function for deriving its preference ratio. The integration application is easy for triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, but it is difficult for pooled fuzzy numbers. Besides, fuzzy preference relation applied in pooled fuzzy numbers that are formed by fuzzy multiplication and aggregation is a hard work because pooled fuzzy numbers must be compared on pair-wise. Through the utilizing relative preference relation being an improvement of fuzzy preference relation, pooled fuzzy numbers will not be compared on pair-wise. Therefore, we can easily generalize SAW under fuzzy environment to solve FMCDM problems through the relative preference relation.For the sake of clarity, the rest of this paper is shown as follows. In Section 2, the related concepts of fuzzy theory are presented. The relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers is expressed in Section 3. In Section 4, a FMCDM model that combines SAW with the relative preference relation is displayed. In Section 5, an example is illustrated to describe the FMCDM model clearly. We compare the proposed model with other fuzzy generalized computations in Section 6.In this section, the related definitions of fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers [39,41,42] are presented below.Definition 2.1Let U be a universe set. A fuzzy subset A of U is defined by a membership function μA(x)→[0, 1], where μA(x), ∀x∈U, denotes the degree of x in A.The α−cut of fuzzy set A is a crisp setAα={xμA(x)≥α}.The support of fuzzy set A is a crisp setSupp(A)={xμA(x)>0}.A fuzzy subset A of U is normal iff supx∈UμA(x)=1.A fuzzy subset A of U is convex iff μA(λx+(1−λ)y)≥(μA(x)∧μA(y)), ∀x, y∈U, ∀λ∈[0, 1], where ∧ denotes the minimum operator.A fuzzy subset A of U is a fuzzy number iff A is both normal and convex.A triangular fuzzy number A is the fuzzy number with piecewise linear membership function μAdefined [39,41,42] bywhich can be indicated as a triplet (al, ah, ar) in Fig. 1.Definition 2.8Let ∘ be an operation on real numbers ℜ, such as +, −, ∗, ∧and∨. Let A and B be two fuzzy numbers. By extension principle [39,41,42], an extended operation ∘ on fuzzy numbers A and B is defined asLet A be a fuzzy number.AαLandAαUare respectively defined asandAαU=supμA(z)≥α(z)[24,25].Definition 2.10A fuzzy preference relation R is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μR(A, B) representing the preference degree of fuzzy numbers A over B[24,25].R is reciprocal iff μR(A, B)=1−μR(B, A) for all fuzzy numbers A and B.R is transitive iffμR(A,B)≥12andμR(B,C)≥12⇒μR(A,C)≥12for all fuzzy numbers A, B and C.R is fuzzy total ordering iff R is both reciprocal and transitive.A is preferred to B iffμR(A,B)>12. On the other hand, A is equal to B iffμR(A,B)=12.Definition 2.11Let A and B be two triangular fuzzy numbers, where A=(al, ah, ar) and B=(bl, bh, br). Addition ⊕ of the two fuzzy numbers derived by extension principle [39,41,42] isBy extension principle [39,41,42], multiplication ⊗ of triangular fuzzy number A and real number t isAccording to the definitions above, we express a relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers in the next section.In this section, we describe related definitions to present a relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers.Definition 3.1Let A=(al, ah, ar) and B=(bl, bh, br) be two triangular fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy preference relation P revised from fuzzy preference relation [24,25,35] is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μP(A, B) representing the preference degree of A over B. DefinewhereT=(tl+−tr−)+2(th+−th−)+(tr+−tl−)2iftl+≥tr−,(tl+−tr−)+2(th+−th−)+(tr+−tl−)2+2(tr−−tl+)iftl+<tr−,tl+=max{al,bl},th+=max{ah,bh},tr+=max{ar,br},tl−=min{al,bl},th−=min{ah,bh},tr−=min{ar,br}.Definition 3.2Let S={X1, X2, ..., Xn} denote a set consisting of n triangular fuzzy numbers, where Xj=(xjl, xjh, xjr)∈S, j=1, 2, ..., n. Then normalized fuzzy numberX˜jof Xj(j=1, 2, ..., n) is defined as follows.X˜j=Xjas S is the set composed of linguistic [12,16], ordinal or qualitative ratings converted into triangular fuzzy numbers in a interval [0,1];X˜j=xl−xjr,xl−xjh,xl−xjlas S is the set consisting of cost ratings;X˜j=xjlxr+,xjhxr+,xjrxr+as S is the set composed of benefit ratings,wherexl−=minj=1,2,...,n{xjl},andxr+=maxj=1,2,...,n{xjr}.Definition 3.3LetS˜={X˜1,X˜2,...,X˜n}denote a set consisting of n normalized triangular fuzzy numbers, whereX˜j=(x˜jl,x˜jh,x˜jr)∈S˜, j=1, 2, ..., n. By extension principle,X¯=1n⊗(X˜1⊕X˜2⊕...⊕X˜n)=(x¯l,x¯h,x¯r)is the mean ofX˜1,X˜2,...,X˜n. A relative preference relation P*, improved from the fuzzy preference relation P of Eq. (1), with membership functionμP*(X˜j,X¯)representing the relative preference degree ofX˜joverX¯inS˜, where j=1, 2, ..., n. DefinewhereTS˜=(ts˜l+−ts˜r−)+2(ts˜h+−ts˜h−)+(ts˜r+−ts˜l−)2fts˜l+≥ts˜r−,(ts˜l+−ts˜r−)+2(ts˜h+−ts˜h−)+(ts˜r+−ts˜l−)2+2(ts˜r−−ts˜l+)ifts˜l+<ts˜r−,ts˜l+=maxj=1,2,...,n{x˜jl},ts˜h+=maxj=1,2,...,n{x˜jh},ts˜r+=maxj=1,2,...,n{x˜jr},ts˜l−=minj=1,2,...,n{x˜jl},ts˜h−=minj=1,2,...,n{x˜jh},ts˜r−=minj=1,2,...,n{x˜jr}.Obviously,0<μP*(X˜j,X¯)<1, where j=1, 2, ..., n. Further,μP*(X˜j,X¯)<12denotes thatX¯is preferred toX˜j,μP*(X˜j,X¯)>12indicates thatX˜jis preferred toX¯, andμP*(X˜j,X¯)=12asX˜j=X¯.Lemma 3.1The relative preference relation P* is a total ordering relation [13,24,25,35] on triangular fuzzy numbers.Based on above,X˜1,X˜2,...,X˜ninS˜are easily ranked according toμP*(X˜1,X¯),μP*(X˜2,X¯), …,μP*(X˜n,X¯). Thus we can develop a FMCDM model that combines SAW with the relative preference relation in the following section.In the section, we develop a FMCDM model combining SAW with relative preference relation to solve FMCDM problems, and present SAW computation steps before the FMCDM model described.Step 1: Identify a decision matrix in a giving FMCDM problem.The decision matrix is shown in Section 1.Step 2: Normalize the decision matrix into a normalized decision matrix.Let Gijbe an evaluation rating in the decision matrix andgij=Gijmaxi=1,2,...,m{Gij}ifj∈Jmini=1,2,...,m{Gij}Gijifj∈J′be normalization of Gij,whereJ is a set composed of benefit criteriaandJ’ is a set consisting of cost criteria for i=1, 2, ..., m;j=1, 2, ..., n.Step 3: Yield a weighted decision matrix from the normalized decision matrix.Let gij×Wjbe the weighted rating of gijto yield a weighted decision matrix for i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n.Step 4: Derive alternative evaluation indices from the weighted decision matrix.LetA′i=∑j=1ngij×Wjbe the evaluation index of alternative Ai, where i=1, 2, ..., m.Step 5: Rank alternatives according to related evaluation indices.Alternatives A1, A2, ..., Amare ranked according to the related evaluation indicesA′1,A′2,...,A′m. The greater the evaluation index, the better the alternative.Based on the steps above, we develop a FMCDM model that combines SAW with the relative preference relation. In the FMCDM model, experts E1, E2, ..., Etare employed to assess m feasible alternatives A1, A2, ..., Amon criteria C1, C2, ..., Cn. Let Gijk=(gijkl, gijkh, gijkr) be evaluation rating employed by expert Ekto measure alternative Aion criterion Cj, where i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n; k=1, 2, ..., t. Gij1, Gij2, ..., Gijtare aggregated into Gij=(gijl, gijh, gijr) that represents the evaluation rating of Aion Cj, where i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n. By extension principle,(3)Gij=(gijl,gijh,gijr)=1t⊗(Gij1⊕Gij2⊕...⊕Gijt),wheregijl=1t∑k=1tgijklgijh=1t∑k=1tgijkh,gijr=1t∑k=1tgijkrandi=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n.LetG˜ijbe the normalization of Gijand classified into three normalization situations in the following.(i)G˜ij=Gijas Gijis assessed by linguistic [12,16], ordinal or qualitative terms converted into a triangular fuzzy number in a interval [0,1].G˜ij=(gjl−gijr,gjl−gijh,gjl−gijl)as Gijbelongs to cost criteria, wheregjl−=mini=1,2,...,m{gijl}, ∀j.G˜ij=(gijlgjr+,gijhgjr+,gijrgjr+)as Gijbelongs to benefit criteria, wheregjr+=maxi=1,2,...,m{gijr}, ∀j.Additionally,Wjk=(wjkl,wjkh,wjkr)is the weight of criterion Cjmeasured by expert Ek, where j=1, 2, ..., n; k=1, 2, ..., t. Wj1, Wj2, ..., Wjtare aggregated intoWj=(wjl,wjh,wjr)that indicates the weight of Cj, where j=1, 2, ..., n. By extension principle,(4)Wj=(wjl,wjh,wjr)=1t⊗(Wj1⊕Wj2⊕...⊕Wjt),wherewjl=1t∑k=1twjkl,wjh=1t∑k=1twjkh,wjr=1t∑k=1twjkr,j=1, 2, ..., n.Based on above equations, the FMCDM model, including normalized group fuzzy decision matrix and related weight matrix, are formatted as the MCDM model described in Section 1.As the FMCDM model is formatted, we express normalized matrix of Aion n criteria to be(5)A˜i=[G˜i1,G˜i2,...,G˜in]i=1, 2, ..., m.In addition, mean matrixA¯derived from the m normalized alternativesA˜1,A˜2,...,A˜mon n criteria is shown below.(6)A¯=[G¯1,G¯2,...,G¯n],whereG¯j=1m(G˜1j⊕G˜2j⊕...⊕G˜mj),j=1, 2, ..., n.Based on above,G¯jrepresents mean ofG˜1j,G˜2j,...,G˜mjfor all normalized alternatives on Cj, where j=1, 2, ..., n. For Cj,μP*(G˜ij,G¯j)represents the relative preference degree ofA˜ioverA¯on the criterion, where i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n. Let(7)G˜ij=(g˜ijl,g˜ijh,g˜ijr)and(8)G¯j=(g¯jl,g¯jh,g¯jr),whereg¯jl=1m∑i=1mg˜ijl,g¯jh=1m∑i=1mg˜ijh,g¯jr=1m∑i=1mg˜ijr.Then(9)μP*(G˜ij,G¯j)=12(g˜ijl−g¯jr)+2(g˜ijh−g¯jh)+(g˜ijr−g¯jl)2TSj+1,whereTSj=(tsjl+−tsjr−)+2(tsjh+−tsjh−)+(tsjr+−tsjl−)2iftsjl+≥tsjr−,(tsjl+−tsjr−)+2(tsjh+−tsjh−)+(tsjr+−tsjl−)2+2(tsjr−−tsjl+)iftsjl+<tsjr−,tsjl+=maxi=1,2,...,m{g˜ijl}tsjh+=maxi=1,2,...,m{g˜ijh},tsjr+=maxi=1,2,...,m{g˜ijr},tsjl−=mini=1,2,...,m{g˜ijl},tsjh−=mini=1,2,...,m{g˜ijh},tsjr−=mini=1,2,...,m{g˜ijr}.i=1, 2, ..., m.WithμP*(G˜ij,G¯j)and Wj, we yield Dito denote the weighted preference degree ofA˜ioverA¯for i=1, 2, ..., m. Let(10)Di=(W1⊗μP*(G˜i1,G¯1))⊕(W2⊗μP*(G˜i2,G¯2))⊕...⊕(Wn⊗μP*(G˜in,G¯n)),wherei=1, 2, ..., m.Diis similar toA′iin SAW because the relative preference degreeμP*(G˜ij,G¯j)substitutes for ratingG˜ijin Eq. (10) to avoid multiplying two fuzzy numbers (i.e.Wj⊗G˜ij). Let Di=(dil, dih, dir) due toμP*(G˜ij,G¯j)being a crisp value for i=1, 2, ..., m.Then(11)D¯=(d¯l,d¯h,d¯r).represents the mean of D1, D2, ..., Dm,whered¯l=1m∑i=1mdil,d¯h=1m∑i=1mdih,d¯r=1m∑i=1mdir.Based on the relative preference relation P*,μP*(Di,D¯)is the relative preference degree of DioverD¯to be recognized as the evaluation index of Ai, where j=1, 2, ..., n. Define(12)μP*(Di,D¯)=12(dil−d¯r)+2(dih−d¯h)+(dir−d¯l)2TSd+1,whereTSd=(tsdl+−tsdr−)+2(tsdh+−tsdh−)+(tsdr+−tsdl−)2iftsdl+≥tsdr−,(tsdl+−tsdr−)+2(tsdh+−tsdh−)+(tsdr+−tsdl−)2+2(tsdr−−tsdl+)iftsdl+<tsdr−,tsdl+=maxi=1,2,...,m{dil},tsdh+=maxi=1,2,...,m{dih},tsdr+=maxi=1,2,...,m{dir},tsdl−=mini=1,2,...,m{dil},tsdh−=mini=1,2,...,m{dih},tsdr−=mini=1,2,...,m{dir},i=1, 2, ..., m..Obviously,0<μP*(Di,D¯)<1, where i=1, 2, ..., m. The greater the evaluation index, the better the alternative. We can rank the m alternatives according toμP*(D1,D¯),μP*(D2,D¯), …μP*(Dm,D¯). Thus ranking order is determined as the alternative evaluation indices are yielded. The best alternative is found and FMCDM is finished.A logistical enterprise desires to select a location for establishing a new distribution center. Four experts E1, E2, E3 and E4 are employed in a consult council to evaluate three feasible locations A1, A2 and A3 based on six related criteria that are climate condition (C1), demand quantity (C2), expansion possibility (C3), investment cost (C4), labor force (C5) and transportation availability (C6). In addition to investment cost (C4; unit: million dollars) belonging to cost criteria, the others are benefit criteria.Additionally, linguistic terms and corresponding fuzzy numbers expressing various evaluation ratings and criteria weights are respectively shown in Tables 1 and 2.In Table 3, the four experts express evaluation ratings for locations on six criteria, and they display criteria weights in Table 4.In addition to the ratings of C4, normalized evaluation ratings by Eq. (3) and (i) of Section 4 are derived and presented in Table 5according to entries of Tables 1 and 3. The normalized evaluation ratings of C4 are yielded by (ii) of Section 4 and also expressed in Table 5.Based on entries of Table 5, means of ratings for three locations against six criteria are yielded and shown in Table 6.Through entries of Tables 2 and 4, weights against six criteria computed by Eq. (4) are expressed in Table 7.According to entries of Tables 5 and 6, we calculate the relative preference degreeμP*(G˜ij,G¯j)ofG˜ijoverG¯jby Eq. (9), where i=1,2,3; j=1,2,…,6. The relative preference degrees of evaluation ratings over corresponding means against six criteria are respectively displayed in Table 8.Multiplying entries of Table 7 by entries of Table 8, we derive the weighted preference degrees of evaluation ratings over corresponding means against six criteria presented in Table 9.By Eq. (10), we aggregate entries of Table 9 along three varied locations into the weighted preference degrees of locations over mean matrix in Table 10.Based on entries of Table 10, the mean of D1, D2 and D3 derived by Eq. (11) isD¯=(1.2375,1.8750,2.5625)According to entries of Table 10 andD¯, the relative preference degreeμP*(Di,D¯)of DioverD¯, representing the evaluation index of Ai, computed by Eq. (12) is shown in Table 11, where i=1,2,3.The total performance evaluation indices of three locations are A1: 0.4653, A2: 0.6105 and A3: 0.4242. Thus rank order determined by the evaluation indices is A2>A1>A3. It is obvious that A2 is the best location to establish a new distribution center.To demonstrate the model's feasibility and rationality, we compare the proposed FMCDM model with other fuzzy generalization SAW computations as we refer to Wang's approach [37]. In the other fuzzy generalized SAW, multiplying [26,30,39,41,42] two triangular fuzzy numbers by Eqs. (13) and (14) is presented as follows.Definition 6.1LetG˜ij=(g˜ijl,g˜ijh,g˜ijr)andWj=(wjl,wjh,wjr)be two triangular fuzzy numbers. Multiplication ⊗ ofG˜ijand Wjis defined aswhere i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n.The membership function ofG˜ij⊗Wjis(14)μG˜ij⊗Wj(x)=(−Fij+(Fij2−4(Pij−x)Zij)1/2)/2Zij,Pij≤x≤Qij1,x=Qij(Uij−(Uij2−4(Eij−x)Vij)1/2)/2Vij,Qij≤x≤Eij0,otherwise,wherePij=g˜ijlwjl,Qij=g˜ijhwjh,Eij=g˜ijrwjr,Fij=g˜ijl(wjh−wjl)+wjl(g˜ijh−g˜ijl),Zij=(g˜ijh−g˜ijl)(wjh−wjl),Uij=g˜ijr(wjr−wjh)+wjr(g˜ijr−g˜ijh),Vij=(g˜ijr−g˜ijh)(wjr−wjh).G˜ij⊗Wj, representing weighted rating for Aion Cj, is not a triangular fuzzy number, where i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n. Based on Definition 6.1, the evaluation index PAiof Aiis derived by Eqs. (15) and (16)[30] for fuzzy generalized SAW in the following.Definition 6.2LetPAi=G˜i1⊗W1⊕G˜i2⊗W2⊕...⊕G˜in⊗Wnrepresent the evaluation index of Aiin fuzzy generalized SAW. Definewhere i=1, 2, ..., m.The membership function of PAiis presented as follows.(16)μPAi(x)=(−Fi+(Fi2−4(Pi−x)Zi)1/2)/2Zi,Pi≤x≤Qi1,x=Qi(Ui−(Ui2−4(Ei−x)Vi)1/2)/2Vi,Qi≤x≤Ei0,otherwise,wherePi=∑j=1nPij=∑j=1ng˜ijlwjl,Qi=∑j=1nQij=∑j=1ng˜ijhwjh,Ei=∑j=1nEij=∑j=1ng˜ijrwjr,Fi=∑j=1nFij=∑j=1n(g˜ijl(wjh−wjl)+wjl(g˜ijh−g˜ijl)),Zi=∑j=1nZij=∑j=1n(g˜ijh−g˜ijl)(wjh−wjl),Ui=∑j=1nUij=∑j=1n(g˜ijr(wjr−wjh)+wjr(g˜ijr−g˜ijh)),Vi=∑j=1nVij=∑j=1n(g˜ijr−g˜ijh)(wjr−wjh).Obviously, PAiis a pooled fuzzy number to express the evaluation index of Aiin fuzzy generalized SAW, where i=1, 2, ..., m. It may be hard to rank alternatives in fuzzy generalized SAW due to alternative evaluation indices being pooled fuzzy numbers. The pooled fuzzy numbers are derived from fuzzy multiplication and aggregation. To resolve the tie, we utilize three varied fuzzy representation computations in fuzzy generalized SAW. One is Chou's [9] canonical representation show in Eq. (17), the other is Chen [6] and Liang's [26] optimistic and pessimistic utilities expressed by Eq. (18), and another is Chen and Hsieh's [7] graded mean integration representation presented by Eq. (19). The related definitions of the three varied fuzzy representation computations are respectively expressed as follows.Definition 6.3Let Uc(Gij⊗Wj) be the utility of Gij⊗Wjyielded by Chou's canonical representation. Definewhere i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n.Definition 6.4Let Ut(PAi) be the representation of PAibased on Chen and Liang's optimistic and pessimistic utilities that have the same importance. Definefor i=1, 2, ..., m,wherexR=(2x1t+2Uidt+dt2/Vi−dt((2Ui+dt/Vi)2+4(x1t−Ei)/Vi)1/2)/2,xL=(2x2t+2Fidt+dt2/Zi−dt((2Fi+dt/Zi)2+4(x2t−Pi)/Zi)1/2)/2,x1t=mini=1,2,...,m{Pi},x2t=maxi=1,2,...,m{Ei},dt=x2t−x1t.Definition 6.5Let Ug(PAi) be the representation of PAiderived by Chen and Hsieh's graded mean integration representation. Definefor i=1, 2, ..., m.Based on Eq. (17), Chou's canonical representation multiplies two fuzzy numbers easily. However, Chou's canonical representation will lose fuzzy messages because defuzzification is used in the initial step. In short, the advantage of Chou's canonical representation is simple on computation, whereas its disadvantage is in losing fuzzy messages. For Eqs. (18) and (19), the representation computations(i.e. defuzzification) are only used in the final step. Undoubtedly, the computations of Eqs. (18) and (19) can reserve lots of fuzzy messages. However, multiplying two triangular fuzzy numbers into a pooled fuzzy number and aggregating several pooled fuzzy numbers are complex from Definitions 6.1 and 6.2. Therefore, defuzzification used in the final step will make fuzzy generalized SAW hard. In short, the two utility computations advantages for Eqs. (18) and (19) that reserves more information than Eq. (17). However, their disadvantages are in complicated computations, especially for Chen and Liang's optimistic and pessimistic utilities.Based on Eqs. (17)–(19), we utilize the three fuzzy generalized SAW computations including Chou's, Chen and Liang's, as well as Chen and Hsieh's to yield the representations of evaluation indices, being presented in Table 12, for the three locations A1, A2 and A3 of Section 5.The rank orders derived by the three varied computations are the same, i.e. A2>A1>A3. Likewise, The ordering is consistent with that yielded by the proposed model. In fact, we may realize that A2 is the best alternative based on Tables 5 and 7. In Table 5, we know that A2 has higher ratings than the other locations on C1, C3 and C4. In Table 7, the three criteria C1, C3 and C4 have higher importance than the other criteria. Therefore, A2 may be the best location through the two tables above. Of course, our proposed model and the three fuzzy generalized SAW computations can find that A2 is the best location in this illustrated example.Through the descriptions above, we compare our proposed model with the three fuzzy generalized SAW computations. We find the difference between our proposed model and the three fuzzy generalized SAW computations as follows. The proposed model avoids multiplying two fuzzy numbers as Chou's canonical representation does, and reserves fuzzy information as Chen and Liang's optimistic and pessimistic utilities as well as Chen and Hsieh's graded mean integration representation do. Therefore, the proposed model reserves more messages than Chou's due to its defuzzification being not occurred in the first step. Moreover, the proposed model computation is easier than Chen and Liang's as well as Chen and Hsieh's due to multiplying two fuzzy numbers being unnecessary. Obviously, there are the proposed model's advantages in this paper.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we propose a FMCDM model that combines SAW with the relative preference relation to solve FMCDM problems. The proposed FMCDM model is recognized as the fuzzy generalization of SAW. Practically, fuzzy generalized SAW is commonly difficult due to fuzzy multiplication, aggregation and ranking. In the proposed model, we utilize the relative preference relation to derive the relative preference degrees of evaluation ratings over mean substituting for evaluation ratings, and then derive evaluation indices for fuzzy generalized SAW. Through the relative preference relation, it is obvious that the ties of fuzzy multiplication, aggregation and ranking can be resolved in the proposed model. In addition, we compare the proposed model with the other three generalized SAW computations including Chou's [9] canonical representation, Chen [6] and Liang's [26] optimistic and pessimistic utilities, as well as Chen and Hsieh's [7] graded mean integration representation to demonstrate our model's feasibility and rationality by the illustrated example of Section 5. The example's result yielded by the proposed model is consistent with the other generalized SAW computations’. Besides, the proposed model avoids multiplying two fuzzy numbers as Chou's canonical representation does, and reserves fuzzy information as Chen and Liang's optimistic and pessimistic utilities as well as Chen and Hsieh's graded mean integration representation do. There are the proposed model's advantages in this paper. Therefore, we utilize the model based on SAW and the relative preference relation to solve FMCDM problems easily and efficiently.
