@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The problem of sharing a cost M among n individuals, identified by some characteristicci∈R+,appears in many real situations. Two important proposals on how to share the cost are the egalitarian and the proportional solutions. In different situations a combination of both distributions provides an interesting approach to the cost sharing problem. In this paper we obtain a family of (compromise) solutions associated to the Perron’s eigenvectors of Levinger’s transformations of a characteristics matrix A. This family includes both the egalitarian and proportional solutions, as well as a set of suitable intermediate proposals, which we analyze in some specific contexts, as claims problems and inventory cost games.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A (cost-surplus) sharing problem consists of the division of a certain amount M among a group of n agents. We assume that each agent i (i = 1, 2, …, n) is identified by means of a (numerical) characteristic cirelevant in the distribution of the total amount M. We may find many real situations covered by this simple model. Let us observe, for instance, the following ones:[1]A typical example is how to allocate the total cost M of a facility (for instance, a water supply system) among the n towns that will share it. The characteristic cimay be, in this example, the proportion of the total population living in each of these towns. A cost allocation is a vector x = (x1, x2, …, xn) such that x1 + x2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + xn= M. The two more popular ways to share the total cost M are the egalitarian and the proportional ones (see, for instance, Moulin, 1988).Another example comes from analyzing costs in one-to-many distribution systems. This kind of problem has a logistic feature, namely the distribution cost (see, for instance, Turkensteen and Klose, 2012). A single facility, whose location is yet to be determined, serves geographically dispersed demand points (consumers). Once the location of the facility and the distribution cost (the cost of the optimal delivery route) M has been obtained, the problem to be analyzed is how the cost M is allocated to consumers. Again, there are two focal positions: the cost is allocated in an egalitarian way, so any costumer pays (per unit) an equal part of the total distribution cost; or, the cost is allocated in a proportional way with respect to the characteristic ci, that in this example could represent the distance between the facility and the consumer i, or the cost of a direct delivery from the facility to the consumer.The so-called claims problem(O’Neill, 1982) involves n agents identified by some claims ci, i = 1, 2, …, n on an estate M that is not sufficient to cover the aggregate claimC=∑i=1nci,that is C > M. The problem is how to allocate the estate M among the claimants by taking into account the claims cithe agents have on it. Among the many rules defined in this class of problems, two prominent solutions are the proportional and the egalitarian ones.In a recent paper, Karsten and Basten (2014) present a model on how to share the benefits in pooling of spare parts between multiple users. As they mention, “important savings may be obtained if pooling is taken into account. While promising this does raise the question on how the [users] should share the benefits”. In order to construct their model, they use the proportional rule to divide the costs (in this case, proportionality is with respect to the demand rate of each individual). Instead of using proportionality, an egalitarian allocation could also be considered. A similar situation may be found in Meca, Timmer, García-Jurado, and Borm (2004) (see also Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera, 2011) where an inventory cost game is presented in order to allocate the benefits of cooperation. They use a proportional approach in order to define a solution that is proved to be on the core of the cooperative game.All of the above situations may be expressed by the abstract model:An amount M must be shared among agents i = 1, 2, …, n by considering the individuals’ characteristics ci.As mentioned, the proportional and the egalitarian solutions are two focal approaches to solve this model. In many situations, a combination of these solutions could make sense. For instance, if we go back to the water supply system example, it is clear that the population (the characteristic) of each town affects the size of the system. Then, a proportional (with respect to the characteristics) distribution of the cost seems reasonable. But, on the other hand, most of the cost does not depend on the supplied population, so an egalitarian share (regardless of the characteristics) could be as reasonable as the proportional division. As consequence, a combination of both distributions provides an interesting approach. Our proposal is within this perspective.One possibility is to consider convex combinations of these two solutions. This idea has been recently developed in the context of claims problems (situation [3]) where the characteristic cirepresents the individual is claim (see Giménez-Gómez and Peris, 2014). In that article they propose the αmin solution by using a specific convex combination of the egalitarian and the proportional solutions with the idea of guaranteeing a minimal amount to each individual (regardless of their claims) and allocating the remaining in a proportional way.We propose an alternative approach to obtain intermediate solutions: instead of taking convex combinations of the egalitarian and proportional solutions, we use eigenvectors of some suitable matrices. In so doing, we define the characteristics matrix of a problem as the matrix whose rows are all identical to the vector of individuals’ characteristics ci. By using this matrix A, we get an alternative way of obtaining the main solutions. In particular, the egalitarian solution corresponds to the right eigenvector of matrix A and the proportional solution corresponds to the left eigenvector (or, equivalently, to the right eigenvector of the transpose matrix At). Then, we present our family of compromise solutions for the sharing problem, as the ones associated to the Perron’s eigenvectors of each convex combination of the characteristics’ matrix and its transpose (Levinger’s transformation). The egalitarian and proportional solutions are obtained for α = 0 and α = 1, respectively. We analyze the main properties of these compromise solutions as functions of the parameter α that defines the convex combination.When analyzing some particular situations, we realize that the egalitarian solution could propose inadmissible allocations. For instance, in situation [2], if cirepresents the cost of the individual delivery, rationality implies that no agent should pay more than this amount. In situation [3] the characteristic cidenotes the claim that individual i has on the endowment. Then, it is obvious that no agent should receive more than her claim. Finally, in situation [4] the proposal should give an allocation in the core of the cooperative game. As in the egalitarian case, other solutions associated to Perron’s eigenvectors of Levinger’s transformations could be inadmissible proposals. However, we will show that it is always possible to find some admissible ones.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical model we are going to use, and defines the characteristics matrix associated to a cost sharing problem. In Section 3 we obtain the main properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the convex combinations of the characteristics matrix and its transpose. Finally, in Section 4, we analyze some particular situations (claims problems and inventory cost games).A cost sharing problem with relevant characteristics is defined by a finite set of agents N = {1, 2, …, n}, the total cost M to be allocated to the agents, and the characteristics vector11Throughout the paper, vectors are considered column vectors, vn × 1. The transposed (row) vector is denoted by vt.ct= [c1, c2, …, cn], identifying each agent. The issue is how to share the total cost M among the agents.22Although we consider cost sharing problems, our reasoning could be immediately applied to surplus sharing situations.A cost sharing solution (sharing rule) associates to each sharing problem (M, c), an allocationx=(x1,x2,…,xn)∈Rn,such that xi≥ 0 (no subsidies are allowed) and∑i=1nxi=M(efficiency). The value xiis the amount individual i contributes to the total cost M.The most popular sharing rules are the egalitarian (Egal) and the proportional (Prop) ones. Equal division establishes that each agent is allocated the same part of the total amount,xi=Egali≡Mn,foralli∈N.Proportional division, with respect to vector c establishes the cost allocationxi=Propi≡ci∑i=1nciM,foralli∈N.If we denote by veg the vector with all entries equal to 1/n, and by vprthe vector whose i-component isci∑i=1nci,then the egalitarian and proportional solutions may be written as:Egal=Mveg,Prop=Mvpr.Given a square positive matrix A (aij> 0, for all i, j), Perron’s theorem (Perron, 1907) ensures the existence of an eigenvalue of A, λ(A), which is strictly positive and has associated a positive eigenvector v* > 0 such that Av* = λ(A)v*, and λ(A) = ρ(A), the spectral radius of this matrix.33Moreover, this eigenvalue is simple, strictly greater than any other eigenvalue, and no other eigenvalue has a positive eigenvector associated, see, for instance, Berman and Plemmons (1994).We consider positive eigenvectors normalized so that the sum of its components is equal to 1,∑i=1nvi*=1.Note that this fact guarantees the uniqueness of the associated positive eigenvector.Given a positive square matrix A, the Levinger’s transformation of A(Levinger, 1970) is the family of matrices obtained throughout convex combinations of A and its transpose At, that is, defined byA(α)=αAt+(1−α)Aα∈[0,1].We denote by v(α) the normalized positive eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue λ(α), in the corresponding α Levinger’s transformation. We know (see Fiedler, 1995) that the Levinger’s function, defined by Perron’s eigenvalue λ(α), is a non-decreasing function in the sub-interval[0,12]and that it is symmetric aboutα=12.Any positive normalized vector v* > 0 provides a way of sharing an amount M among n individuals:xi=Mvi*,i=1,2,…,n.If we use the normalized eigenvectors v(α), associated to the Levinger’s transformationA(α),then we obtain a family of possible cost allocations, by varying the parameter α,xi(α)=Mvi(α),i=1,2,…,n.We are not interested in general positive matrices, but in a particular class defined by the characteristics of the individuals involved in the cost sharing problem. In order to introduce our matrix, let us consider a cost sharing problem (M, c) and define the square matrix A associated to this problem by:A=ect=(c1c2…cnc1c2…cn…………c1c2…cn)where et= [1, 1, …, 1]. Without loss of generality, we consider the components in vector c increasingly ordered:c1≤c2≤⋯≤cnand normalized (taken in relative sizes), so that∑i=1nci=1.It must be noticed that the (normalized) eigenvector associated to a matrix B coincides with the one associated to any proportional matrix A = γB, for anyγ∈R.This fact allows us to select the matrix associated to a cost sharing problem with row sum equals to 1.Due to the normalization of vector c, matrix A is stochastic44A stochastic matrix (also termed probability matrix, or Markov matrix) is a square matrix such that each of its entries is a non-negative real number representing a probability (so, each row sum is 1). See, for instance, Berman and Plemmons (1994) for formal definitions and main properties of stochastic matrices.and it is immediate to observe thatλ(A)=1,Aveg=veg,Atvpr=vpr.Then, by using our notation as Levinger’s normalized eigenvectors,Egal=Mv(0),Prop=Mv(1).Moreover, given these allocations, it is clear that any convex combination of the eigenvectors, v = αvpr+ (1 − α)veg= αv(1) + (1 − α)v(0) defines a new distribution that provides an intermediate proposal among those.An alternative approach to obtaining intermediate (compromise) proposals could be to compute convex combinations of the matrices A and Atand proposing the Perron’s eigenvector of this convex combination as the way of defining the new allocation. In other words, we want to use the Perron’s normalized eigenvector associated to Levinger’s transformation of the characteristics matrix A,A(α)=αAt+(1−α)A.For each α the eigenvector v(α) defines a solution x(α) = Mv(α) to the cost sharing problem (M, c). We are interested in analyzing the properties of these allocations as functions of the parameter α that defines the transformation. First, we show that λ(α) is a symmetric function that achieves its maximum atα=12,and moreover we will prove that it is a concave function. However, our main interest is the analysis of the behavior of the normalized components of the positive associated eigenvectors v(α) as nonlinear functions of the parameter α, since these components provide the compromise solution.Definition 1Given a cost sharing problem with total cost M and individuals’ characteristics c1 ≤ c2 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ cn, the compromise solution associated to α ∈ [0, 1] is the allocation defined byx(α)≡Mv(α).The following example compares the distributions proposed by the egalitarian and the proportional solutions and illustrates our compromise solutions.Example 1Consider the cost sharing problem of a common facility (a water supply system) that will be used by five cities. We suppose that the total cost is M = 100 (consider percentage) and that the characteristics diare identified by the population (in thousands) living in each city, that we suppose [d1 = 200, d2 = 240, d3 = 380, d4 = 460, d5 = 720]. Then, the egalitarian solution gives the cost sharing Egal = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20). The proportional (with respect to the population in each city) solution proposes the cost sharing Prop = (10, 12, 19, 23, 36).The population in each city (normalized so that the total sum of the population is equal to 1) is ct= [0.10, 0.12, 0.19, 0.23, 0.36]. Then, the characteristics matrix isA=(0.100.120.190.230.360.100.120.190.230.360.100.120.190.230.360.100.120.190.230.360.100.120.190.230.36)If we now consider the convex combination given by α = 0.3282, the Perron’s eigenvalue is λ(α) = 1.0453 and the cost allocation defined by the Perron’s eigenvector is x(α) = (16.86, 17.49, 19.69, 20.94, 25.02), which is a compromise between the egalitarian and the proportional approaches. Note that this result is different from the one we obtain by considering the convex combination (for α = 0.3282) of the egalitarian and proportional solutions: αProp + (1 − α)Egal = (16.72, 17.37, 19.67, 20.98, 25.25). In fact, there is not α ∈ [0, 1] such that the proposal given by x(α) could be obtained as a direct convex combination of the egalitarian and the proportional solutions.In Theorem 1 we obtain the expression of the dominant eigenvalue λ(α) and its main properties. Part of this result is a particular case of a result stated without proof by Levinger (see Fiedler, 1995; Levinger, 1970). We provide an elemental proof.Theorem 1Let A be a characteristics matrix. Then, the Levinger’s functionλ:[0,1]→R,defined byλ(α)=ρ(A(α)),is continuous, symmetric aroundα=12and strictly concave in the interval [0, 1], achieving its maximum value atα=12and its minimum at α = 0, and α = 1, where λ(0) = λ(1) = 1.It is easy to check that, for all α ∈ (0, 1),rk(A(α))=2,and then the characteristic polynomial of this matrix is:pA(α)(λ)=(−λ)n−2((−λ)2+p1(−λ)+p2),where p1 and p2 are the order 1 and order 2 trace of matrixA(α),p1=∑i=1nci=1,p2=α(1−α)∑i<j(ci−cj)2.Then,λ(α)=1+1+4α(1−α)∑i<j(ci−cj)22.We can immediately observe that this function is continuous, symmetric aroundα=12,strictly concave, minimizes at α = 0 and α = 1, and maximizes atα=12. Moreover, the greatest value of λ(α) depends on the value B = ∑i < j(ci− cj)2 that can be seen as a “certain degree of variance” of the components of the characteristics vector c:λ(12)=1+1+B2.□Consider the matrix A defined by individuals’ characteristics vector ct= [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.45]. Figs. 1, 2and 3show, respectively, the graph of λ(α), the graph of the components of the positive normalized eigenvector associated to λ(α), vi(α), and the graph of their second derivative,vi′′(α),for α ∈ [0, 1] and i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.As we can observe, the eigenvalue function is as indicated in Theorem 1. On the other hand, the components of the eigenvector functions do not intersect and have a monotone behavior (some of them increasing and the remaining ones decreasing). More interesting is the behavior of the second derivative of the eigenvector functions: each component changes from concave to convex, or vice-versa, but all of them do this change at the same value of α. We will prove later that these properties are true in general (see Theorems 3 and 4).In the following result we show that, for a fixed α, the components of the positive eigenvector v(α) are increasingly ordered. This fact is useful in their application to distribution problems, since the characteristics cioften represent some rights or duties and then a desirable property is that more rights (duties) deserve more revenues (payments), which are given by vi(α).Theorem 2Let A be a characteristics matrix and v(α) the normalized Perron’s eigenvector associated to the Levinger’s transformationA(α)=αAt+(1−α)A.Then, vi(α) ≤ vi + 1(α), for all i = 1, 2, …, n − 1 and all α ∈ [0, 1].The proof is based on the fact that we can compute the positive eigenvector v(α) by using the power method (see, for instance, Berman and Plemmons, 1994)v(α)=limk→∞Ak(α)eetAk(α)e.Then, it is enough to observe that, for any k,Ak(α)eis a conic combination of vectors e and c and then it preserves the order provided by c, independently of the value of α ∈ [0, 1].□As an immediate consequence, we obtain that our compromise solutions satisfy the (desirable) property of characteristic monotonicity. When applied to claims problems (situation [3]) it means that greater claims obtain greater allocations. In cost sharing problems (situations [1], [2], [4]) greater demands imply greater cost.Corollary 1Let us consider a cost sharing problem (M, c). Then, the compromise solutions x(α) are characteristic monotonic:ci≤cj⇒xi(α)≤xj(α)∀α∈[0,1].Our next result analyzes the behavior of functions vi(α) and shows how they increase or decrease, by depending on the value of ci.Theorem 3Let A be a characteristics matrix and v(α) the normalized Perron’s eigenvector associated to the Levinger’s transformationA(α)=αAt+(1−α)A.Let us supposec≠1ne.Then,(a)vi(α) is a decreasing nonlinear function in the interval [0, 1] for all i such thatci<1n;vi(α) is an increasing nonlinear function in the interval [0, 1] for all i such thatci>1n;vk(α) is a constant function in the interval [0, 1] ifck=1n.In order to prove Theorem 3 we will use the following Lemma. Let us denote by ekthe k-th vector in the canonical basis,ekk=1,ejk=0,foreachj≠k.Lemma 1Let V be the space generated by vectors e and c, V = 〈e, c〉. Then,(a)V⊥={w∈Rn∣wtA(α)=0}for all α ∈ (0, 1).v(α) ∈ V for all α ∈ [0, 1].ek∈〈V⊥,e〉⇔ck=1n.In order to prove part (a) note thatA(α)=αcet+(1−α)ect,so every vector w ∈ V⊥ fulfillswtA(α)=0.As the dimensions of both vector spaces coincide (note thatrk(A(α))=2,for α ∈ (0, 1)) we obtain the result.(b) Let w ∈ V⊥, w ≠ 0, α ∈ (0, 1) and v(α) the positive eigenvector associated to λ(α). From part (a),wtλ(α)v(α)=wtA(α)v(α)=0.As λ(α) ≠ 0, v(α) ∈ (V⊥)⊥ = V.(c) Let us consider {w1, w2, …, wn − 2} a basis of V⊥ and suppose that there existμ,μ1,μ2,…,μn−2∈Rsuch thatek=μe+μ1w1+μ2w2+⋯+μn−2wn−2.Then,(ek)tA(α)=μetA(α)+μ1(w1)tA(α)+⋯+μn−2(wn−2)tA(α)=μetA(α)=μαet+μ(1−α)nct.On the other hand,(ek)tA(α)=αcket+(1−α)ct.From both equalities, we obtain,(1−nμ)(1−α)ct=α(μ−ck)et,for all α ∈ (0, 1); then1−nμ=0;μ−ck=0⇒ck=1n.Conversely, ifck=1n,by takingμ=1n,it is easy to observe that(ek−μe)tA(12)=0.That is, (ek− μe) ∈ V⊥, so ek∈ 〈V⊥, e〉.□Parts (a) and (b): sincevi(0)=1n,and vi(1) = ci, it is enough to prove that for all i such thatci≠1n,thenvi′(α)≠0,∀α∈(0,1).If there is some i, and some α* ∈ (0, 1) such thatvi′(α*)=0,then we have:[1](ei)tv′(α*)=vi′(α*)=0;etv′(α*) = 0, since etv(α*) = 1;(wj)tv′(α*) = 0, ∀j = 1, 2, …, n − 2, as a consequence of Lemma 1.(ei)tx = 0,etx = 0,(wj)tx = 0, ∀j = 1, 2, …, n − 2,has a unique solution x = 0, so v′(α*) = 0. We are going to show that this fact is not possible. If we compute(v(α))tA(α)v(α)=λ(α)∑i=1nvi(α)2(v(α))tA(α)v(α)=(v(α))t(A+α(At−A))v(α)=∑i=1ncivi(α)Equalizing both terms, and evaluating the derivatives at α = α*:∑i=1ncivi′(α*)=λ′(α*)∑i=1nvi(α*)2+λ(α*)∑i=1n2vi(α*)vi′(α*)As v′(α*) = 0, and v(α*) ≠ 0, then λ′(α*) = 0, soα*=12.On the other hand, by computingctA(α)v(α),with a similar argument we obtain that∑i=1ncivi(α)=α∑i=1nci2λ(α)−1+αBy deriving and substituting atα*=12,0=(∑i=1nci2)λ(12)−1(λ(12)−12)2which is not possible.Part (c): Lemma 1 establishes the equivalence between conditionsck=1nandek=1ne+∑j=1n−2μjwj.Then,(ek)tA(α)v(α)=λ(α)(ek)tv(α)=λ(α)vk(α)and(ek)tA(α)v(α)=1netA(α)v(α)+∑j=1n−2μj(wj)tA(α)v(α)=1nλ(α)∑i=1nvi(α)=1nλ(α)As λ(α) ≠ 0, we obtainvk(α)=1n,for all α ∈ (0, 1).Remark 1The case not covered in this result,c=1ne,is obvious since then matrix A is a scalar matrix,aij=1nfor all i, j = 1, 2, …, n. In this caseA(α)=Afor all α ∈ [0, 1]. Then the eigenvector is constant,v(α)=1nefor all α ∈ [0, 1].In the case of a cost sharing problem, the above result splits the set of agents into two groups: those who have characteristics greater than the average (ci>1n) and those under it. For the first ones, function vi(α) (the amount they pay) is increasing with α, whereas for the rest of agents it is decreasing.Our last result analyzes the concavity/convexity of the vi(α) functions. The most interesting fact is that all of them change from concave to convex (or vice-versa) at the same point, which is near to13independently of the number of individuals.Theorem 4Let A be a characteristics matrix and v(α) the normalized Perron’s eigenvector associated to the Levinger’s transformationA(α)=αAt+(1−α)A.Let us supposec≠1ne.Then, there is αg∈ (0, 1) such that for all i = 1, 2, …, n,(a)vi(α) is a convex function in the interval [0, αg] and a concave function in the interval [αg, 1], ifci<1n;vi(α) is a concave function in the interval [0, αg] and a convex function in the interval [αg, 1], ifci>1n.We are going to prove that there is αg∈ (0, 1) such that the second derivative of vi(αg) equals to zero, for all i = 1, 2, …, n. From the equalities:etA(α)v(α)=λ(α),etA(α)v(α)=α+(1−α)nctv(α),we obtainn∑i=1ncivi(α)=λ(α)−α1−α.By taking the second derivative in the above expression,n∑i=1ncivi′′(α)=λ′′(α)(1−α)2+2λ′(α)(1−α)+2λ(α)−2(1−α)3.On the other hand, if we compute the first and the second derivatives in the expression of λ(α) obtained in Theorem 1 and we substitute them in the above equation, we get that:∑i=1ncivi′′(α)=0⇔F(α)=16Bα3−24Bα2+(9B−3)α+(1−B)=0,where B = ∑i < j(ci− cj)2. As F(0) = 1 − B > 0, and F(1) = −2 < 0, there is αg∈ (0, 1) such that F(αg) = 0. Moreover, since F( + ∞) = +∞, F(α) changes its sign after α = 1, so it has a real root at some α > 1. With a similar reasoning, since F( − ∞) = −∞, F(α) has a real root at some α < 0. Then αgis the unique root in the interval (0, 1).As rk{wi, i = 1, 2, …, n − 2} is a basis of V⊥ and V = 〈e, c〉, it is clear that rk{c, e, wi, i = 1, 2, …, n − 2} = n. Then, the linear system[1]ctx = 0,etx = 0,(wj)tx = 0, ∀j = 1, 2, …, n − 2,has a unique solution, x = 0. As v′′(αg) satisfies all conditions, then we obtainvi′′(αg)=0,i=1,2,…,n.It can be proved (see Remark 2) thatαg<13.Now, we only need to characterize the components functions vi(α) that change from concave to convex, and vice versa. As the only zero point for the second derivative is αg, we only need to investigate what happens in a point of the interval (αg, 1].λ(α)vk(α)=(ek)tA(α)v(α)=αck+(1−α)∑i=1ncivi(α).1nλ(α)=1nλ(α)etv(α)=1netA(α)v(α)=α1n+(1−α)∑i=1ncivi(α).By subtracting both equalities, we obtain:vk(α)=αλ(α)(ck−1n)+1n.Computing the second derivative atα^=12we get:sign(vk′′(α^))=sign(ck−1n)and the required result holds.□By solving the third order equation that appears in the previous theorem16Bα3−24Bα2+(9B−3)α+(1−B)=0it is not hard to obtain the explicit expression for αg:αg=1/2[1−B+1Bcos(arccos(BB+1)+π3)]Figure 4shows the graph of this function. An approximation is obtained with the fifth order Taylor polynomial, taken atB=13.This expression is useful to see that13is an upper bound of αg.αg≈13−0.0264B+0.01335B2−0.00818B3+0.00437B4−0.00130B5.Theorem 4 provides an endogenous way to select a particular value of α in order to select a compromise solution.Definition 2Given a cost sharing problem with total cost M and individuals’ characteristics c1 ≤ c2 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ cn, we call αg-compromise solution to the allocation defined bySi(αg)≡Mvi(αg)i=1,2,…,nwhere αgis the value obtained in Theorem 4.Consider again the cost sharing problem in Example 1. Then, we first compute the values B = 0.215 and αg≈ 0.3282. Then, the allocation defined by the Perron’s eigenvector v(αg) isS(αg)=(16.86,17.49,19.69,20.94,25.02),which is a compromise between the proposals of egalitarian and the proportional approaches.The αg-compromise solution sets an abstract compromise based on the mathematical properties of the solution. The meaning of this solution will depend on the model of situation we have. From the mathematical point of view, as the increase of a component in vector x(α) involves decrease in other (others) component, there is no optimal way (for all individuals) to select one of these compromise solutions. If we select the ‘inflection’ point αgeach agent whose participation in the total cost increases with respect to α(ci>1n)minimizes her increasing rate at αg. Reciprocally, if an agent’s allocation decreases with respect to α(ci<1n)she maximizes her decreasing rate at αg. In this sense the αgpoint gives a (mathematically) coherent compromise solution.Remark 3Nevertheless, this particular solution could yield a “non-admissible” allocation in some situations. For instance, if we have a claims problem (situation [3]) with endowment M = 100, and agents’ claims ct= [15, 18, 28.5, 34.5, 54], the characteristics matrix coincides with the one in Example 1, so the αg-compromise solution coincides. Then, agent 1 is allocated x1 = 16.86 that is greater than her claim, and this solution is not admissible in claims problems. This trouble is caused because the egalitarian solution itself Egal = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20) is not admissible. A similar consideration could be made with respect to situation [4] in which the proposals are usually required to belong to the core of the cooperative game and, in general, the egalitarian solution does not fulfill this condition. We discuss this kind of situations in the next section.As mentioned, an egalitarian allocation is not always an admissible solution, in the sense that it is not rational, or does not belong to the core. However, we could be interested in finding an allocation “as egalitarian as possible”. As we have shown, our compromise solutions x(α) provide a family of intermediate proposals from the egalitarian (α = 0) to the proportional (α = 1). Then, we can find suitable values of α in order the allocation x(α) to be admissible and then to find the most egalitarian compromise solution among the admissible ones.Although the notion “as egalitarian as possible” can be defined in any context, we analyze the problem in two particular situations: inventory cost games and claims problems.The inventory cost game is defined by associating to every inventory cost situation (N, a, (mi)i ∈ N),55N = {1, 2, …, n} denotes the set of agents, miis the optimal number of orders per time unit for agent i if she does not cooperate, and a is the fixed cost of an order (Fiestras-Janeiro et al., 2011).the characteristic function:c(S)=2a∑i∈Nmi2,forS⊆N,S≠∅;c(∅)=0.Meca et al. (2004) propose a solution in the core of the game defined in a proportional way, that they call SOC-rule:SOCi≡c2(i)∑j=1nc2(j)c(N)i∈N.This is a kind of proportional solution, where proportionality is taken with respect to the characteristics ci= c2(i).Nevertheless, the egalitarian allocationxi=c(N)ni∈N,has not been used in this context since, in general, it does not belong to the core. In our family of compromise solutions we may find the minimum value of α such that x(α) belongs to the core (that is, we may obtain the most egalitarian compromise solution in the core of the inventory cost game). This solution is obtained by finding:αeq=min{α∈[0,1]:∑i∈Nxi(α)=c(N),∑i∈Sxi(α)≤c(S),forallS⊂N}This minimal value always exists since x(1) coincides with the proportional solution (the SOC-rule) and x(α) is continuous with respect to α.In order to illustrate the range of values of α such that x(α) gives an allocation in the core of the game, we use the following example taken from Meca et al. (2004) slightly modified.66In the original example the egalitarian allocation is in the core.We consider three airline companies, L1, L2, L3 that operate in the same country. [...] Over time, each firm has learned how much taillights are used on the average in a year: L1 needs 50 taillights per year, L2 needs 400, and L3 needs 500. The holding cost to store one light for one year is, respectively, 11, 10 and 9.6 dollars. The cost of placing an order for taillights equals 600 dollars.This situation defines the inventory cost game with function:c({1})=812.4;c({2})=2190.89;c({3})=2400;c({1,2})=2336.7;c({1,3})=2533.6;c({2,3})=3249.6;c({1,2,3})=3349.6.The SOC-rule allocates the total cost c(N) proportionally to the coefficients ci= c2({i}), so the normalized characteristics matrix is:A=(0.05880.42780.51340.05880.42780.51340.05880.42780.5134)Then, the allocation x(α) is in the core of the game for all α ∈ [0, 1], such that α ≥ αeq≊0.35545, and this value determines the most egalitarian compromise solution in the core. The allocation proposed by this compromise solution is xeq= [812.4, 1221.2, 1316]. The SOC-rule proposes the allocation SOC = [197, 1433, 1719.6], that coincides with the compromise solution for α = 1. Note that, being the compromise solution as egalitarian as possible, agent 1 is allocated their maximum rational amount, c({1}). Proposals x(α) with αeq< α < 1 provide intermediate proposals between xeqand the SOC solution.We now consider a claims problem defined by the pair (M, r), where M is the endowment and rt= [r1, r2, …, rn] are the claims of the agents. The situation is a conflicting claims problem (bankruptcy) whenR=∑i=1nri>M.As noticed in Remark 3, the egalitarian proposalEgali=Mni=1,2,…,nis not in general admissible (that, in this context, means that no agent should receive more than her claim). In this case, we may find the value of α that delimits the admissible compromise solutions.Theorem 5Let A be a characteristics matrix with row vector ct, and v(α) the normalized Perron’s eigenvector associated to the Levinger’s transformationA(α)=αAt+(1−α)A.Letκ∈R,κ > 1. Then, there is αeq∈ [0, 1] such that:v(α)≦κc⇔α≥αeq.If we computeA(α)v(α),A(α)v(α)=αAtv(α)+(1−α)Av(α)=αc+(1−α)(∑i=1ncivi(α))eand, from Theorems 1 and 3, we know that∑i=1ncivi(α)=α∑i=1nci2λ(α)−1+α,λ(α)=1+1+4α(1−α)B2.Then, we have the inequalityv(α)=1λ(α)A(α)v(α)=1λ(α)(αc+α(1−α)∑i=1nci2λ(α)−1+αe)≦κcwhich is equivalent to(1)α(1−α)∑i=1nci2λ(α)−1+αe≦(κλ(α)−α)c.Note that the left hand of this inequality is constant for all i. So, as the entries in c are increasingly ordered, then (1) only requires to be checked for i = 1,(2)α(1−α)∑i=1nci2λ(α)−1+α≦(κλ(α)−α)c1,that obviously holds for α = 1. The following value provides the equalityαeq=κ2B2c12−2κBCc1+κ(κ+1)Bc12+C2−(κ+1)Cc1+κc12κ2B2c12−2κBCc1+(κ2+1)Bc12+C2−2Cc1+c12whereB=∑i<j(ci−cj)2,C=∑i=1nci2.In order to prove that for any α ∈ [αeq, 1] the inequality (2) holds, it is sufficient to observe that the relevant condition is v1(α) ≤ κc1 and that from Theorem 3v1(α) is a decreasing function. So, α > αeq, α ∈ [0, 1], implies v1(α) ≤ v1(αeq) ≤ κc1.□As a consequence we obtain the following result for claims problems.Corollary 2Let (M, r) be a claims problem and A the characteristics matrix withci=ri∑j=1nrj.Then there is αeq∈ [0, 1] such that for all α ∈ [αeq, 1] x(α) is an admissible allocation, that isx(α)≦r.The compromise solution is x(α) = Mv(α). Then, we only need to apply Theorem 5 by consideringκ=∑i=1nriMthat is greater than 1.□Moreover, as in the case of Subsection 4.1, αeqprovides the most egalitarian compromise solution among the admissible ones.
