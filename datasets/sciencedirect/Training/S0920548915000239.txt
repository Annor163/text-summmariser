@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Operatives' training is crucial in emergency management. Traditional exercises to improve procedures interoperability and harmonization between agencies are complex and expensive. Research on command and control systems specifically designed for emergency management and on virtual reality use leads towards enhancing real world applications' capabilities, facilitating management and optimizing resource usage.This paper proposes a new architecture for a training system based on the interconnection between real and virtual worlds extending the MPEG-V standard; allowing real and virtual units' simultaneous and real-time training using commercial off-the-shelf equipment, and including a novel subsystem for video management from both real and virtual sources.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A virtual world (VW) is a computer-based simulated environment where users interact through avatars and intelligent agents. The current applications go beyond merely entertaining purposes [1,2] as they have become a powerful tool to enhance the capabilities of real world (RW) applications and have been widely used for training and learning in different areas, including military units; vehicle driving and flight simulators. Trainees can learn and practice how to perform tasks while working toward animated agents that can collaborate with human trainees in the virtual worlds [1]. Furthermore, the capabilities of traditional virtual systems can be enhanced and extended if a hybrid system is implemented including data from real sources [3,4].In the case of crisis management, the use of virtual reality to create immersive training exercises for human beings allows personnel to operate with modern computer equipment; respond rapidly to unforeseen events in situations under stress, and to perform joint exercises with a significant reduction on costs and complexity. However, the interaction of real and virtual worlds with new standards (i.e., MPEG-V), allowing data streaming between both worlds and using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, has not yet been exploited and means going a step further in the state of the art.This paper presents a new architecture for emergency management training that connects virtual worlds and command and control systems operating in the real world. An innovative and key feature is the use of the MPEG-V standard, which has been extended to develop a middleware, called “interconnection gateway”, where different applications can interoperate, contributing to an extendable and scalable solution.Another significant contribution is the inclusion of a subsystem for streaming, displaying and recording video flows from both real world cameras and virtual world live streams.A continuous training in a virtual environment based on the proposed architecture helps the staff that intervenes in real crisis resolution enhance their actuation protocols, considerably reduce the response time in the case of an emergency, and improve their effectiveness. Any user can gather information about its state through sensor values, video streaming or specific messages. Any actions performed in the real world are represented in the virtual world (and vice versa).The main technical challenges and goals are:•Represent the reality with high fidelity for crisis managers and first responders (those who first assist in an emergency situation) in order to help develop actuation strategies and homogenize procedures.Enable collaboration among teams of users, software agents and avatars. Crisis management personnel from different organizations and locations should be able to collaborate in developing strategies.Provide interoperability, interaction and overlapping between real and virtual worlds using the MPEG-V standard to stream real data in a virtual world and vice versa. It is necessary to make an extension of the standard to fit the particularities of the project and the tools used.The paper is structured as follows: first, in Section 2, the related work core concepts and literature gaps are summarized. The system architecture is described in Sections 3 and 4; Section 5 contains the data model, and video insertion is explained in Section 6. A performance evaluation is carried out in Section 7. Finally, in Section 8 the conclusions from the study and future work will be commented.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Analysis and preliminary implementations have been performed using the virtual world engine and development environment OLIVE. Currently, there are tests being conducted using the open source platform OpenSim [45].The basic consideration of command and control architectures that reflect two main dimensions has been taken into account to develop the proposed architecture: the organizational structure and the communication network structure. On the other hand, the distributed nature of the system allows simulating in real time the same crisis in different computers geographically separated, although the simulation server is centralized. The interactions of each participant (whether they are virtual or real entities) are seamless in order to maintain coherence during the whole simulation.The interconnection gateway developed by the research team provides two significant contributions to the state of the art: first, it acts as a middleware connecting a C4ISR for emergency management with a virtual world that simulates accurately the real world where the C4ISR is operating. On the other hand, it implements a data model built as an extension to the MPEG-V standard, which contributes to guaranteeing interoperability.The Virtual Video Server represents a separate subsystem to efficiently manage video flows from real and virtual sources. It does not deal directly with video coding, although this could be a line for future research, as well as video optimization and MPEG-V annotation.We can assert that the proposed architecture for joint real/virtual training in emergency management offers an innovative, interoperable, flexible and scalable solution that helps improving the knowledge in the area of emergency management and, as a direct consequence, improve the ways of actuation and response in the event of crisis. Besides, results obtained with the test bench demonstrate that the system has a satisfactory performance and that the use of resources is adequate. Future plans include evaluating the quality of experience (QoE).Future plans are to continue exploring different platforms for virtual world management to develop virtual environments representing different types of real environments, and to integrate stationary sensors and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Also, current work is being developed to add augmented reality into the training system, in order to measure and improve the quality of experience.Also, we intend to perform tests related to network capabilities and service availability, which should provide a valuable set of results for analysis and validation of the system.On the other hand, a continuous and key task that will be continued in the future is keeping track of new studies covering a gamut of applications from areas that are out of the scope of this paper, which will contribute to verify the validity of our system and raise new and interesting research challenges.Finally, synchronization in distributed environments, such as in the case of VW, RW and the coupling between them, is a line of research in which the research team plans to also keep on deepening in the near future.
