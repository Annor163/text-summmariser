In this paper, we studied fuzzy linear fractional differential equations (FLFDEs), under Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability as the fuzzy initial value problemsD0+αy(x)=λ⊙y(x)+f(x). Some of the previous results on solutions of these equations are concreted. We obtained new solutions by using the fractional hyperbolic functions and their properties, in details. Finally, an application and two examples are given to illustrate our results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
For first time, the concept of solutions for fractional differential equations with uncertainty under Riemann–Liouville differentiability concept [19] is given by Agarwal et.al [5]. Recently, Salahshour et al. [3,25] defined Riemann–Liouville differentiability of fuzzy-valued functions by using Hukuhara difference (H-difference) which called Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability. This concept is constructed based on strongly generalized differentiability concept [7,8] and Riemann–Liouville derivative. The strongly generalized differentiability concept is a useful and applicable tool dealing to fuzzy differential equations (see for example [4,6,9–11,16–18,24]). FLFDEs with constant coefficients are one of the simplest fuzzy fractional differential equations which may appear in many applications [5,25]. Let I=[a, b] be a compact interval on the real axisℝandCF(I)andLF(I)are the space of all continuous fuzzy-valued functions and the space of all Lebesque integrable fuzzy-valued functions on I, respectively. Let x∈I,λ∈ℝandf,y∈CF(I)∩LF(I). A FLFDE with constant coefficients is as the following initial value problem:(1)D0+αy(x)=λ⊙y(x)+f(x),x>a,α>0,D0+α−1y(a)=y0.The problem (1) with 0<α≤1 and based on Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability concept was studied in [3,25], by applying the successive approximation method [21] and fuzzy Laplace transform method [2], respectively. In fact, the solution functions are obtained by usingRL[(1)−α]-differentiability for the case λ>0 and by usingRL[(2)−α]-differentiability for the case λ<0. In this paper, we complete the studies in [3,25] and present the solutions of problem (1) in the general case. Our results complete some results of Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability of fuzzy-valued functions and obtain new solutions of the problem which have not been included in [3,25]. Namely, in Theorems 4.8 and 4.9, we give the solutions expression ofRL[(1)−α]-differentiable for the case λ<0 andRL[(2)−α]-differentiable for the case λ>0.This paper is organized as follows:In Section 2, we recall some required definitions and results of fuzzy arithmetic and Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability. The fractional hyperbolic functions and their properties are brought in Section 3. In Section 4, we first, concrete the previous obtained solutions on Eq. (1), and next, find the new solutions of the Eq. (1), using fractional hyperbolic functions and their properties. Finally, an application and two examples are given to illustrate our results in Section 5.We denote the set of all fuzzy numbers onℝbyℝF. A fuzzy number traditionally, is defined in [1,15,27] by membership function as follows:Definition 2.1A fuzzy number is a function such asu:ℝ→ℝFwith the following properties:(i)u is normal, i.e., there existsx0∈ℝsuch that u(x0)=1.u is fuzzy convex, i.e., for allx,y∈ℝand 0≤λ≤1, it holds thatu(λx+(1−λ)y)≥min{u(x),u(y)}.u is upper semi-continuous, i.e., for anyx0∈ℝ, it holds thatu(x0)≥limx→x0+u(x).cl{x∈ℝ|u(x)>0}is a compact subset ofℝ, where cl denotes the closure of a subset.An equivalent parametric definition is given in [13,31] as follows:Definition 2.2A fuzzy number u in parametric form is a pair u=(u−(r), u+(r)) of functions u−(r), u+(r), 0≤r≤1, which satisfy the following properties:(i)u−(r) is a bounded non-decreasing left continuous function in (0, 1], and right continuous at 0,u+(r) is a bounded non-increasing left continuous function in (0, 1], and right continuous at 0,u−(r)≤u+(r), 0≤r≤1.Definition 2.3[12,31]. Let u be a fuzzy number and r∈[0, 1]. The r-cut or r-level set [u]ris defined as[u]r={x∈ℝ|u(x)≥r},0<r≤1,and[u]0=cl{x∈ℝ|u(x)>0}.Definition 2.4[27]. The Hausdorff distance between fuzzy numbers is defined as the functionD:ℝF×ℝF→[0,+∞)by the equationD(u,v)=sup0≤r≤1dr(u,v),where u=(u−(r), u+(r)),v=(v−(r),v+(r))anddr(u,v)=max{|u−(r)−v−(r)|,|u+(r)−v+(r)|}.D(λ⊙u,λ⊙v)=|λ|D(u,v),∀λ∈ℝ,D(u+w,v+w)=D(u,v),∀u,v,w∈ℝF,D(u+v,w+z)≤D(u,w)+D(v,z),∀u,v,w,z∈ℝF, and(ℝF,D)is a complete and separately metric space, (see [14,27]).Please note that in throughout of the paper, the interval I=[0, A] for A>0 is considered as an interval fixed and the functionf:I→ℝFthat called fuzzy-valued function, is denoted based on the r-cut representation as f(x)=[f−(x;r), f+(x;r)],x∈I, 0≤r≤1.Definition 2.5[25]. Letf∈CF(I)∩LF(I). The fuzzy Riemann–Liouville integral of fuzzy-valued function f is defined as follows:(I0+αf)(x)=1Γ(α)∫0x(x−t)α−1f(t)dt,x>0,0<α≤1,whereΓ(α)=∫0∞xα−1e−xdxis gamma function.Theorem 2.6[25]. Letf∈CF(I)∩LF(I). The fuzzy Riemann–Liouville integral of f can be expressed as follows:(I0+αf)(x)=[(I0+αf−)(x;r),(I0+αf+)(x;r)],0≤r≤1,where(I0+αf*)(x;r)=1Γ(α)∫0x(x−t)α−1f*(t;r)dt,*∈{−,+}.Definition 2.7[7,8]. Letu,v∈ℝF. If there existsw∈ℝFsuch thatu=v+wthenwis called the H-difference ofu,vand it is denoted asu⊖v.In this paper, the sing ⊖ stands always for H-difference and let us remark thatu⊖v≠u−v=u+(−1)v.Definition 2.8[25]. Letf∈CF(I)∩LF(I), x0>0 andΦ(x)=1Γ(1−α)∫0xf(t)(x−t)αdt. We say that f is Riemann–Liouville H-differentiable of order 0<α≤1 at x0, if there exists an elementD0+αf(x0)∈ℝF, such that for h>0 sufficiently small(1)D0+αf(x0)=limh→0+Φ(x0+h)⊖Φ(x0)h=limh→0+Φ(x0)⊖Φ(x0−h)h,orD0+αf(x0)=limh→0+Φ(x0)⊖Φ(x0+h)−h=limh→0+Φ(x0−h)⊖Φ(x0)−h.Remark 2.9In Ref. [25], the authors consider four cases for fuzzy fractional derivatives under Riemann–Liouville integral. Here, we only consider the two first cases of Definition 3.2 in [25]. In the other cases, the derivative is trivial because it is reduced to a crisp element. (see Theorem 3.3 in [25]).For sake of simplicity, we say that the fuzzy-valued function f isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable, (RL[(2)−α]-differentiable) if it is differentiable in concept (1), (concept (2)) of Definition 2.8.Theorem 2.10[25]. Letf∈CF(I)∩LF(I), x0>0 and 0<α≤1. Then(i)If f isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable, thenD0+αf(x0)=[D0+αf−(x0;r),D0+αf+(x0;r)],0≤r≤1.If f isRL[(2)−α]-differentiable, thenD0+αf(x0)=[D0+αf+(x0;r),D0+αf−(x0;r)],0≤r≤1,whereD0+αf*(x0;r)=1Γ(1−α)ddx∫0x(x−t)−αf*(t;r)dtx=x0,*∈{−,+}.In this section, we point out to the fractional hyperbolic functions and their properties that will be used in the next section.The Mittag-Leffler function frequently used in the solutions of fractional order systems (see [19,20,22,23,26,28,29]), and defined as follows:Eα,β(x)=∑k=0∞xkΓ(αk+β),α>0,β>0.The hyperbolic functions of fractional order are defined by the Mittag-Leffler function as follows:coshα,β(x)=∑k=0∞x2kΓ(2αk+β)=E2α,β(x2),α>0,β>0,andsinhα,β(x)=∑k=0∞x2k+1Γ(2αk+α+β)=xE2α,α+β(x2),α>0,β>0.We observe that,coshα,β(x)≥0,∀x∈ℝ, and it is an even function. Also, sinhα,β(x)≥0 if x≥0 and sinhα,β(x)<0 if x<0, and it is an odd function.For simplicity, in case α=β, we denote Chα(x) and Shα(x), instead coshα,α(x) and sinhα,α(x), respectively. It is easy to see that:(2)Chα(x)+Shα(x)=Eα,α(x),(3)Chα(x)−Shα(x)=Eα,α(−x).Please note that for eachx∈ℝand 0<α≤1 the function Eα,α(x) is always positive (see Lemma 2.2 of Ref. [30]). Also, the hyperbolic functions are special cases of fractional hyperbolic functions, in other words:cosh(x)=E2,1(x2)=Ch1(x),sinh(x)=xE2,2(x2)=Sh1(x).Now, we express derivation rules for the fractional hyperbolic functions.Lemma 3.1Suppose that x∈I and take α>0. For eachλ∈ℝand γ≤α, we have:(4)(a)D0+γ(xα−1Chα(λxα))=xα−γ−1coshα,α−γ(λxα);α>γ,λxα−1Shα(λxα);α=γ,(5)(b)D0+γ(xα−1Shα(λxα))=xα−γ−1sinhα,α−γ(λxα);α>γ,λxα−1Chα(λxα);α=γ.Proof(a). The Proof is straightforwardD0+γ(xα−1Chα(λxα))=1Γ(1−γ)ddx∫0xtα−1Chα(λtα)(x−t)γdt=ddx∑k=0∞λ2kx2kα+α−γΓ(2kα+α−γ+1)=∑k=0∞λ2kx2kα+α−γ−1Γ(2kα+α−γ);α>γ,∑k=0∞λ2k+2x2kα+2α−1Γ(2kα+2α);α=γ,=xα−γ−1coshα,α−γ(λxα);α>γ,λxα−1Shα(λxα);α=γ.The case (b) can be proved, similarly. □As an immediate consequent from relationships (2)–(5), we get:(6)D0+γ(xα−1Eα,α(λxα))=xα−γ−1Eα,α−γ(λxα);α>γ,λxα−1Eα,α(λxα);α=γ.Let us consider a FLFDE as the following problem;(7)D0+αy(x)=λ⊙y(x)+f(x),x>0,0<α≤1,D0+α−1y(0)=y0,whereλ∈ℝ,y0∈ℝFandf:I→ℝFis a fuzzy-valued function.Definition 4.1Lety:I→ℝFbe a fuzzy-valued function. If it isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable and y andD0+αy(x)satisfy problem (7), we say y isRL[(1)−α]-solution of problem (7). Similarly, if it isRL[(2)−α]-differentiable and y andD0+αy(x)satisfy problem (7), we say y isRL[(2)−α]-solution of problem (7).Definition 4.2Let C(I) and C−[0, 1] are respectively, the space of continuous real functions on I and the space of left continuous real functions on [0, 1]. The length or diameter operator is the functionℓ:CF(I)→C(I)×C−[0,1]defined asℓf(x)=f+(x;r)−f−(x;r),∀x∈I,∀r∈[0,1].Proposition 4.3Letα,β∈ℝ, andf,g∈CF(I). It is easy to see that, for all x∈I:ℓ(α⊙f+β⊙g)(x)=|α|ℓf(x)+|β|ℓg(x),ℓ(α⊙f⊖β⊙g)(x)=|α|ℓf(x)+|β|ℓg(x).Provided that the H-difference exists.Lemma 4.4Suppose that the functiony(x)∈CF(I)∩LF(I)is Riemann–Liouville H-differentiable in sense (1) or (2) of Definition2.8for all x∈I and x>0. ThenℓD0+αy(x)=D0+αℓy(x),if and only if y beRL[(1)−α]-differentiable at point x, andℓD0+αy(x)=−D0+αℓy(x),if and only if y beRL[(2)−α]-differentiable at point x.ProofLet y(x)=[y−(x;r), y+(x;r)] where x>0 and r∈[0, 1]. If y isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable at x, then by using Theorem 2.10 (i), for all r∈[0, 1], we haveD0+αℓy(x)=D0+αy+(x;r)−D0+αy−(x;r)=D0+αy+(x;r)−D0+αy−(x;r)=ℓD0+αy(x).Analogously, if y isRL[(2)−α]-differentiable at x, then by using Theorem 2.10 (ii), we obtainD0+αℓy(x)=D0+αy+(x;r)−D0+αy−(x;r)=D0+αy−(x;r)−D0+αy+(x;r)=−ℓD0+αy(x),∀r∈[0,1].Conversely, since y is Riemann–Liouville H-differentiable for x∈I and x>0, soD0+αy(x)constitutes a fuzzy-valued function. Then, we haveℓD0+αy(x)=max{D0+αy−(x;r),D0+αy+(x;r)}−min{D0+αy−(x;r),D0+αy+(x;r)}≥0.Now, ifℓD0+αy(x)=D0+αℓy(x)>0then y isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable at point x and ifℓD0+αy(x)=−D0+αℓy(x)>0then y isRL[(2)−α]-differentiable at point x. Let us, assume that ∃x0∈I and x0>0, such thatD0+αℓy(x0)=0. It follows that,∃c∈ℝ, such thatD0+αy(x0)={c}. Let y beRL[(2)−α]-differentiable at x0. (Reasoning in the caseRL[(1)−α−]differentiability at x0 is similarly). According to Definition 2.8, (2), we deduce for h>0 sufficiently small, such that x0+h∈I:ϕ(x0)≃ϕ(x0+h)+(−1)h{c}.So, we haveϕ(x0+h)≃ϕ(x0)⊖(−1)h{c}=ϕ(x0)+h{c}.Thus, the H-difference ϕ(x0+h)⊖ϕ(x0) exists. Similarly, we obtain:ϕ(x0)≃ϕ(x0−h)+h{c},for h>0 sufficiently small, such that x0−h∈I. Then, ∃ϕ(x0)⊖ϕ(x0−h). Consequently, y isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable at x0 withD0+αy(x0)={c}, which completes the proof. □The solutions by usingRL[(1)−α]-differentiable for case λ>0 andRL[(2)−α]-differentiable for case λ<0, are given in [5], as follows, respectively:(8)y(x)=xα−1Eα,α(λxα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt,and(9)y(x)=xα−1Eα,α(λxα)⊙y0⊖(−1)∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt.Provided that the H-difference exists.Theorem 4.5The functions(8) and (9)areRL[(1)−α]-solution andRL[(2)−α]-solution, for cases λ>0 and λ<0 of problem(7), respectively.ProofBy applying length operator on the function (8) and from positive characteristic the Mittag-Leffler function, for x>0, we find thatℓy(x)=xα−1Eα,α(λxα)ℓy0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(λ(x−t)α)ℓf(t)dt.By taking fractional derivative of order 0<α≤1 and applying relationship (6), we result thatD0+αℓy(x)=λxα−1Eα,α(λxα)ℓy0+λ∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(λ(x−t)α)ℓf(t)dt+ℓf(x)=λℓy(x)+ℓf(x)=ℓ(λ⊙y(x)+f(x))=ℓD0+αy(x).Similarly, from the function (9) where λ<0, we will findD0+αℓy(x)=λℓy(x)−ℓf(x)=−(−λℓy(x)+ℓf(x))=−ℓ(λ⊙y(x)+f(x))=−ℓD0+αy(x).Therefore, based on Lemma 4.4, the proof is completed. □Remark 4.6Please notice that, if the H-difference (9) does not exist then, based on the above mentioned results, we cannot say anything about the existence of solution for the problem (7) in case λ<0. Furthermore, the behaviour of the solution function should reflects the real behaviour of a system. Therefore, if the solution of the equation is not unique, then we may sometimes choose a better solution between two solutions, for example, we can study the real system and choose the solution which have better reflects from behaviour of the system.By considering Remark 4.6, we should seek the solutions of problem (7) for cases λ<0 withRL[(1)−α]-differentiability and λ>0 withRL[(2)−α]-differentiability, if we want to use of Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability concept. To this end, we first, search the solution functions as the following result.Lemma 4.7Consider the problem(7)with symmetric initial value in special formy0=[y0−(r),y0+(r)], whichy0−(r)=−y0+(r),∀r∈[0,1]and also f(x)=g(x)⊙y0, where g(x) is a crisp continuous function on I. Then, the function(10)y1(x)=xα−1Eα,α(−λxα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(−λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt,isRL[(1)−α]-solution for case λ<0, and the function(11)y2(x)=xα−1Eα,α(−λxα)⊙y0⊖(−1)∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(−λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt,isRL[(2)−α]-solution for case λ>0. Provided that the H-difference exists.Based on Theorem 4.5 the functions y1 and y2 areRL[(1)−α]-differentiable for λ<0 andRL[(2)−α]-differentiable for λ>0, respectively. Letyi(x)=[yi−(x;r),yi+(x;r)],i=1,2. It is easy to see thatyi−(x;r)=−yi+(x;r),i=1,2. We get from (10) the following:y1*(x;r)=xα−1Eα,α(−λxα)y0*(r)+∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(−λ(x−t)α)f*(t;r)dt,where *∈{−, +}. These functions are the solutions corresponds to the following crisp problems (see [23,28]):D0+αy1*(x;r)=−λy1*(x;r)+f*(x;r),*∈{−,+},D0+α−1y1*(0;r)=y0*(r).Since,y1−(x;r)=−y1+(x;r), the above system is equal to the following system:(12)D0+αy1−(x;r)=λy1+(x;r)+f−(x;r),D0+αy1+(x;r)=λy1−(x;r)+f+(x;r),D0+α−1y1−(0;r)=y0−(r),D0+α−1y1+(0;r)=y0+(r).The system (12) gives usD0+αy1(x)and y1(x) satisfy equation (7) with λ<0. Consequently y1 is aRL[(1)−α]-solution of problem (7).Analogously, from (11), we will attain to the following system:(13)D0+αy2+(x;r)=λy2−(x;r)+f−(x;r),D0+αy2−(x;r)=λy2+(x;r)+f+(x;r),D0+α−1y2−(0;r)=y0−(r),D0+α−1y2+(0;r)=y0+(r).That results the function y2 is aRL[(2)−α]-solution of problem (7). Consequently, the Proof is completed. □Case 1.λ<0. For findingRL[(1)−α]-solution we first, replace relationship (3) into function (10), that follows that:y1(x)=xα−1Chα(λxα)⊙y0−Shα(λxα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Chα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)−Shα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt,Now, we connect y1(x) to vector c=(c1, c2, c3, c4) with |ci|=1, i=1, 2, 3, 4, as follows:(14)y1(x;c)=xα−1c1Chα(λxα)⊙y0−c2Shα(λxα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1c3Chα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)−c4Shα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt.By Proposition 4.3, we result ℓy1(x;c)=ℓy1(x), for each x>0, so based on Lemma 4.4, the function y1(x;c) isRL[(1)−α]-differentiable, too. Since λ<0, from (14), we gety1*(x;r;c)=xα−1Chα(λxα)(c1⊙y0(r))*−Shα(λxα)(c2⊙y0(r))*+∫0x(x−t)α−1Chα(λ(x−t)α)(c3⊙f(t))*−Shα(λ(x−t)α)(c4⊙f(t))*dt,where *∈{−, +}, x>0 and r∈[0, 1]. By applying (4) and (5), we obtainD0+αy1*(x;r;c)=λxα−1Shα(λxα)(c1⊙y0(r))*−Chα(λxα)(c2⊙y0(r))*+∫0x(x−t)α−1Shα(λ(x−t)α)(c3⊙f(t))*−Chα(λ(x−t)α)(c4⊙f(t))*dt+(c3f(x;r))*,*∈{−,+}.The above system is transformed into system (12), if we take c1=c3=1 and c2=c4=−1. Consequently, we proved the following result.Theorem 4.8For λ<0, theRL[(1)−α]-solution of problem(7), is given by(15)y1(x)=xα−1Chα(λxα)⊙y0+Shα(λxα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Chα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)+Shα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt,Theorem 4.9For λ>0, theRL[(2)−α]-solution of problem(7), is given by(16)y2(x)=xα−1Chα(λxα)⊙y0⊖(−1)Shα(λxα)⊙y0⊖(−1)∫0x(x−t)α−1Chα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)⊖(−1)Shα(λ(x−t)α)⊙f(t)dt.Provided that the H-differences exist.For each λ>0, x∈I andC∈ℝF, the difference Chα(λxα)C⊖(−1)Shα(λxα)C exists. Since the length of the r-cut set of Chα(λxα)C is Chα(λxα)ℓr(C), which is greater than the length of the r-cut set of (−1)Shα(λxα)C, that is, Shα(λxα)ℓr(C), where we have used the positive character of the function Chα(λxα)−Shα(λxα)=Eα,α(−λxα).The results obtained in previous section, guarantee the existence ofRL[(1)−α]-solution for a FLFDE in form (7) with each real number λ. This is useful both theoretically and practically. Indeed,RL[(2)−α]-solution, given as (9) or (16) is depended on the existence of H-difference and so it is possible that, a such solution do not exist or exists for a small interval of time. A necessary condition for the existence ofRL[(2)−α]-solution can be obtain by (9) and (16) as follows:xα−1Eα,α(−|λ|xα)ℓ(y0)≥∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(−|λ|(x−t)α)ℓ(f(t))dt,λ∈ℝ,x>0.This condition is a strong restrict for existenceRL[(2)−α]-solution when ℓ(y0) is very small, that means that the uncertainty in initial value y0 is very little.In final this section, in the sake of applying obtained solutions (15) and (16), we solve two examples.Example 5.1Consider the following FLFDE:(17)D0+αy(x)=λ⊙y(x),0<x<1,D0+α−1y(0)=y0∈ℝF.The solutions by usingRL[(1)−α]-differentiability for λ>0 and also,RL[(2)−α]-differentiability for λ<0, were found in [3] as the following function:y(x)=xα−1Eα,α(λxα)⊙y0.We observe thatD0+αy(x)=λxα−1Eα,α(λxα)ℓ(y0)=λℓ(y(x)). Thus, for problem (17), the function y(x) isRL[(1)−α]-solution if λ>0 and it isRL[(2)−α]-solution if λ<0.Now, by applying formula (15), we can obtainRL[(1)−α]-solution of problem (17) for case λ<0, as follows:(18)y1(x)=xα−1Chα(λxα)⊙y0+xα−1Shα(λxα)⊙y0,and by applying formula (16), we obtainRL[(2)−α]-solution of problem (17) for case λ>0, as follows:(19)y2(x)=xα−1Chα(λxα)⊙y0⊖(−1)xα−1Shα(λxα)⊙y0,this function exists by Remark 4.10.For special case, let us consider α=0.5, λ=−1 andD0+−0.5y(0)=(1+r,3−r), then we get the solution from the function (18), as follows:y1(x)=1πx+12(exerfc(−x)−exerfc(x))⊙[1+r,3−r]−12(exerfc(−x)+exerfc(x))⊙[1+r,3−r],and for λ=1 from the function (19), we get:y2(x)=1πx+12(exerfc(−x)−exerfc(x))⊙[1+r,3−r]⊖−12(exerfc(−x)−exerfc(x))⊙[1+r,3−r],whereerfc(x)=2π∫x∞e−t2dt.Example 5.2[25]. Let us consider the following FLFDE:(20)D0+αy(x)=(−1)⊙y(x)+x+1,D0+α−1y(0)=y0∈ℝF.Finding the solutionRL[(2)−α]-differentiable by using fuzzy Laplace transform is given in Example 6.2 from Ref. [25]. According to fuzzy Laplace transform method one leads to determining the lower and upper functions of solution, which are y−(x;r) and y+(x;r). Now, by using Theorem 4.8 we can obtainRL[(1)−α]-solution of the problem (20), as follows:y(x)=xα−1Chα(xα)⊙y0−xα−1Shα(xα)⊙y0+∫0x(x−t)α−1Eα,α(−(x−t)α)(t+1)dt.In this paper, fuzzy linear fractional differential equations of order 0<α≤1 under Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability, is studied. Also, it is corrected and completed some previous results.For future research, we will develop Riemann–Liouville H-differentiability concept based on left and right Riemann–Liouville integral and derivative and also, we will investigate all solutions of FLFDEs of order α>1.
