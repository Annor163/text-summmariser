Temporal mapping of surveillance video for indexing and summarization

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A comprehensive scheme of temporal profile of surveillance video is proposed.It provides the sampling selection, analyzes properties of shape and motion of the temporal profile, develop the algorithms to detect dynamic targets, and measure their motion direction.Finally, the visualization of targets with multiple temporal slices with transparency is provided.Further, robust object detection based on background updating, and real time data transmission of is given.A comparison of our method with other video indexing methods is also given.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work converts the surveillance video to a temporal domain image called temporal profile that is scrollable and scalable for quick searching of long surveillance video by human operators. Such a profile is sampled with linear pixel lines located at critical locations in the video frames. It has precise time stamp on the target passing events through those locations in the field of view, shows target shapes for identification, and facilitates the target search in long videos. In this paper, we first study the projection and shape properties of dynamic scenes in the temporal profile so as to set sampling lines. Then, we design methods to capture target motion and preserve target shapes for target recognition in the temporal profile. It also provides the uniformed resolution of large crowds passing through so that it is powerful in target counting and flow measuring. We also align multiple sampling lines to visualize the spatial information missed in a single line temporal profile. Finally, we achieve real time adaptive background removal and robust target extraction to ensure long-term surveillance. Compared to the original video or the shortened video, this temporal profile reduced data by one dimension while keeping the majority of information for further video investigation. As an intermediate indexing image, the profile image can be transmitted via network much faster than video for online video searching task by multiple operators. Because the temporal profile can abstract passing targets with efficient computation, an even more compact digest of the surveillance video can be created.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A video shows location (where), time (when), people/objects (who/what), and actions/events (how). A surveillance video, however, has a relatively fixed area to monitor and simple actions (passing of object and people) as compared to the entertainment and sports videos. The time is much longer for identifying who and what passed through in the field of view. It is a major task to screen surveillance videos captured day and night to find target objects and persons. Surveillance cameras have been located everywhere for monitoring targets and events, and video data are constantly collected day and night. Searching targets in large video volumes from distributed cameras is not a trivial task. An automatic scanning of candidates in videos and the confirmation by human operators are eventually necessary.This paper generates a profile image to index the entire surveillance videos emphasizing when targets passed (time) critical locations. The indexing means that an examiner of surveillance video can click at the identified targets or suspects in such a profile image for further investigation in the video frames. The profile image can also be used efficiently for long term survey and direct counting of large group or passing flow. In this paper, we make efforts to preserve the target shape in the temporal profile of video for target identification (who/what). Detecting and screening targets and their motion in the profiles (when/how) are easier and faster than watching the video, and so as to visualizing the target moving directions and positions (where) for understanding events. Figs. 1and 2show the preliminary framework of obtaining temporal image from a video sequence [25].
