@&#ABSTRACT@&#
G-quadruplex is a stable, four-stranded DNA or RNA structure formed from guanine-rich regions and implicated in telomere maintenance, replication, gene regulation at transcription level or translation level, etc. Based on bioinformatics methods, we analyzed different putative G-quadruplex motifs (PGQMs) patterns in various genomic regions of two subspecies (indica and japonica) of Oryza sativa and the whole genomes of other 8 species. In total, in the 10 species we discussed, the PGQMs densities in monocots were higher than dicots. 40,483 and 31,795 PGQMs were identified with a density of 108.46 and 84.89 PGQMs/Mb, respectively, in japonica and indica genomes, 10,655 and 5420 loci were found to contain at least one PGQM in their gene bodies (with a percentage of 19% and 14%) indicating a wide distribution of G-quadruplex motifs in O. sativa genome. They preferred to locate in transcription start sites proximal regions and 5′-UTR with relative high enrichment. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that PGQMs are involved in gene transcription and translation. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of different loop length in G-quadruplex and found the density of long loop PGQMs was less than short loop in indica’s intron but it was similar in japonica. Meanwhile, we focused on the loci with PGQMs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of them. As a result, many GO terms were identified and significantly correlated with the loci containing at least one PGQM. The GO analysis in the two subspecies of rice may be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G-quadruplexes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Interest in the biological functions of G-quadruplex forms of nucleic acids, G4 DNA and G4 RNA, has blossomed over the past few years as strong support for their impact on transcription, translation, replication, recombination, chromatin structure and telomere maintenance has emerged (Smargiasso et al., 2008; Wieland and Hartig, 2009). G-quadruplexes are noncanonical secondary structures formed by G-rich stretches of nucleic acids. The basic structure of G-quadruplex consists of four guanines held together by Hoogsteen bonds in a square and planar arrangement, forming a G-quartet. The center of a G-quartet contains a monovalent cation (potassium or sodium) that stabilizes the inwardly oriented oxygen atoms of the four guanines, thereby minimizing their repulsion and providing stability to the quartet. Two or more quartets stack upon each other to form a three-dimensional G-quadruplex structure (Burge et al., 2006). Several conformations can be adopted by G-quadruplexes, including parallel and antiparallel topologies, which can be formed in either intramolecular or intermolecular strands (Fig. 1). Conformation of the G-quadruplex is controlled by strand orientation, loop length and ions present in solution (Burge et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 1989).RNA and DNA folding events have the potential to alter gene expression in vivo (Gollnick et al., 2005), and one such event is G-quadruplexes formation. Using bioinformatics search methods such as the program ‘Quadparser’, ∼375,000 putative G-Quartet motifs (PGQMs) were identified in the human genome (Todd et al., 2005), where G-quadruplexes are found primarily in the intergenic regions and are enriched in telomeres (Azzalin et al., 2007). A large percentage (>40%) of human promoters contain at least one PGQM, implicating PGQMs in potential regulatory functions (Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2007). In addition, several prokaryotes have also been shown to have a higher frequency of PGQMs in upstream regulatory regions (Yadav et al., 2008; Rawal et al., 2006). Genes containing G-quadrulexes have been implicated in control of transcription, translation, stability and structure. Transcription of several oncogenes can be controlled by the promoter region G-quadrulex and binding of several ligands. Control of translation by PGQMs is confirmed by the ESR1 mRNA (Balkwill et al., 2009), the human NRAS proto-oncogene (Kumari et al., 2007), the MT3 metalloproteinase mRNA, and ZIC-1RNA (Arora et al., 2008), all of which have repressed translation when a stable G-quadrulex forms in their 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs). G-quadruplex motifs have also been implicated in stability and post-transcription processing (Christiansen et al., 1994).Genome-wide analyses of G-quaduplexes have been reported for many species, including human, fungi, and chicken, etc. However, the genome-wide analyses of G-quadruplexes in plant genomes are relatively fewer by far. Previously, Mullen et al. (2010) reported the distribution of G-quadruplexes in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, and found possible roles of G-quadruplexes in drought responses. Additionally, Takahashi et al. (2012) reported that G-quadruplexes were enriched in TSS (transcript start sites) and conducted GO analysis in Oryza sativa subsp. japonica. However, only japonica genome and only one G-quadruplex pattern were studied in their work and they did not involve other genic regions, such as coding sequences, 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR and introns. Rice (O. sativa) is one of the most important crops for human consumption, and about one-third of the population depends on rice for more than 50% of caloric intake. Moreover, rice is also one of the most researched plants, and the completion of rice genome sequences made it possible to analyze the genome-wide distribution of G-quadruplexes in the genome and transcriptome of japonica and indica, which are two subspecies of O. sativa.Japonica rice genomic sequences were obtained from the TIGR version 7, released at October 31, 2011. The information about specific components of the genome, including 5′-UTRs, 3′-UTRs, coding sequences, introns and TPR (defined as −500 to +500) was obtained from the gff3 files in the TIGR database. For the alternative splicing of some loci, we only selected one of them to analyze. We also utilized the major annotation provided by TIGR.For comparisons, we also selected other 9 plants species by phylogenetic distance from japonica and the differences between dicots and monocots to analyze the distribution of G-quadruplex. The whole genomic sequences of other species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa indica, Brassica rapa, Lotus japonicus, Sorghum bicolor, Glycine max, Zea mays, were obtained from the NCBI, Ensembl and JGI websites. The version details for these obtained data are provided in Supplementary Table S1.In general, the G-quadruplex motif was defined as d(GXL1−N)3+GX,where d indicates deoxynucleoside, G is guanine, L is any nucleotide including G, N stands for the loop length and the number of guanines constituting the stem is given by X. These definitions correspond to G-quartets of varying stabilities, with larger values of X and smaller values of N generally corresponding to more stable sequences. So far, the studies about G-quadruplex have all used the d(G3+L1–N)3+G3+ rule to identify putative G-quadruplex motifs, but this rule cannot distinguish different PGQMs. For further research on different numbers of guanine tandems with different loop lengths, we changed the rule and defined the following patterns with corresponding regular expression to identify exact start and end positions of PGQMs in the japonica rice genome:G2 pattern: (G{2}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{2} and (C{2}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{2};G3 pattern: (G{3}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{3} and (C{3}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{3};G4 pattern: (G{4}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{4} and (C{4}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{4};G5+ pattern: (G{5,}.{1,7}?) {3,}G{5,} and (C{5,}.{1,7}?) {3,}C{5,};Where the C patterns represented that the G-quadruplexes could form in the complementary strand of the genomic DNA. So the PGQMs identified by the rule d(G3+L1–N)3+G3+ were classified into different patterns. Previously, PGQMs were searched in whole genome sequences and coding sequences, (Mullen et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2012). However, we also analyzed 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, exons and introns for more details. All of the above PGQM patterns were identified in the entire japonica and indica rice genomes using a perl program. The PGQMs reported here are non-overlapping, such that any continuous stretch of PGQM sequence will count as one, regardless of the number of registers. For further research on PGQM of different loop lengths, we divided the GXpattern into two parts, i.e., the short loop pattern GXL1−3 and the long loop pattern GXL1−7 (when we calculated the PGQMs with a loop length of 1–7, the short loop pattern with a maximum loop size of three nucleotides was also identified, so the long loop pattern GXL1−7 appearing in this paper was defined as not comprising of GXL1−3 by excluding the short loop pattern.)
