Implementation of referral guidelines at the interface between pediatric primary and subspecialty care

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A collaborative approach to development of Referral Guidelines incorporates the end user during development and promotes buy-in.Active dissemination of guidelines promotes utilization by PCPs at or near the point of care.Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of Referral Guidelines on improving cost, quality, and access measures.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundIn pediatric medicine, inadequate access to subspecialty care is widespread. Referral Guidelines are structured tools that describe criteria for subspecialty referral and may decrease medically unnecessary referrals and thereby improve access.ProblemVariation in referral rates and suboptimal communication around pediatric subspecialty referrals leads to inappropriate and ineffective use of scarce clinical resources.GoalsConnecticut Children×³s Medical Center prioritized the development of collaborative care tools at the interface between primary and subspecialty care, including Referral Guidelines.StrategyA comprehensive set of Referral Guidelines was developed and consisted of background information on a given condition, strategies for initial evaluation and management, instructions for how and when to refer, and what the patient and family could expect at the visit with the subspecialist. A key component of the initiative was the integral role of the PCP during development.ResultsTwenty-eight Referral Guidelines have been developed among 15 subspecialty areas. A novel process for active dissemination of Referral Guidelines was piloted in one medical subspecialty area and led to a reduction in overall referrals and an increase in the proportion of referrals meeting the necessary criteria.
