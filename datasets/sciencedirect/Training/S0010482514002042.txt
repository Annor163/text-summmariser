@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Skin cancers are found either in the epidermis or in the dermis, and are categorized into melanoma and non-melanoma. Among all types, the melanoma metastasizes rapidly, causes the majority of the deaths and targets soft tissues like lung and liver [1]. This is mainly due to the fact that the epithelial malignant cells can easily metastasize to secondary sites from that of the primary sites, since the skin has access to both nearby lymphatic systems as well as blood vessels. Additionally, the malignant cells are composed of growth promoting chemical substances that stimulate the formation of nearby blood vessels to enhance the supply of nutrition and oxygen. Thus, it is of prime concern for most physicians to identify the early traces of melanoma using the available medical procedures and to initiate the proper treatment as early as possible.The standard procedure for early detection of melanoma is the naked-eye examination of morphological features using various subsurface feature extraction devices, such as handheld dermoscopes. In order to determine its cause and condition, surgical excisions as well as pathological studies are considered as the foremost medical protocol. From the standpoint of early detection of skin cancers, currently many new non-invasive imaging modalities are explored all over the world [2–6]. These modalities have their own advantages/disadvantages, and some of them are limited to special care centers/research facilities.Apart from the advanced techniques [2–6], the past few years have witnessed the growing role of thermography for sub-surface cancer detection [5–10]. Initial investigations reported considerable number of studies [7–10] indicating the effectiveness of thermography for detection of early breast malignancies. In the recent past, a number of investigations have been focused on the thermal evaluation of the skin cancer [5,6,11–13] as well as the breast cancer [10] using various modeling efforts. It has been found from the literature [5,6,11–13] that, the quantification and automation of the early diagnosis process of skin cancer using various thermographic methods are yet to mature. Thus, there is a necessity for further research to develop a better diagnostic method and to assess its capability for early detection.The two significant signs that are often referred in the thermal images for cancer detection are (a) change in the surface temperature due to increase in the metabolic reaction and capillary blood perfusion [5] and (b) effect of convection heat transfer on the surface temperature due to blood flow near the lesion. Initially, Lawson [8] suggested that the local temperature of cancer affected tissue is few degrees higher compared to the surrounding normal tissues which can be marked as hot spots assisted by asymmetrical vascular pattern. Later, Lawson and Chughati [14] revealed that, the nearby blood vessels and vessels leaving the malignant sites increase the tissue temperature by few degrees due to the arterial and venous convection. The key factor that cannot be overlooked from these studies is the influence of subsurface blood flow on the resulting surface temperature of the skin during the thermal evaluation. An important aspect of vascular flow is that, vessels can either serve as a heat source or sink depending upon the nearby tissue temperature and environmental conditions. Few studies involving various thermal applications [15,16] have reported the localized heat exchange process between tissues and vessels due to blood flow in single and counter-current vessel pairs. The change in the local temperature at subsurface region due to blood flow often leads to the variation in the skin surface temperature. This is evident from the reported thermographic study on vascular diseases [17]. Clearly, the above studies indicate that, the blood flow plays a major role in the alteration of skin surface thermal response, which further changes the evaluation criteria during the disease diagnosis at an early stage.The localized warmer region due to an increase in the metabolism and blood perfusion are frequently considered in the earlier studies [5,6,11–13] to detect the melanoma. However, the studies that model the blood flow to determine the thermal response of diseased condition [18,19] and subsurface skin melanoma during thermographic evaluation are scarce. The effect of blood flow on the thermal response of the skin surface has been investigated by Liu and colleagues for (a) the detection of tumor located in the vicinity of large blood vessels [18], and (b) the detection of atherosclerosis plaques found in the carotid artery [19] using thermography. The study pertains to the surface temperature nonuniformity during tumor detection using thermography [18] discusses that, the larger vessels have a significant effect on the surface temperature and may lead to false negative or false positive diagnosis. The present study also discusses a similar event as that of [18] with the focus being on the detection of early melanoma, and to individuate its different development stages within a specific model of vascularized skin using thermography. The present work further discusses the effect of blood rheological parameters on the flow characteristics and the effect of increasing malignant volume on the surface temperature. The previous modeling efforts [5,6,11–13] for the detection of skin melanoma have been carried out by considering the Pennes bioheat equation [20] only. It is well-known from the reported studies [21,22] that, the Pennes bioheat equation can accurately model the essence of energy exchange due to blood perfusion. However, the equation fails to evaluate the thermal effect of blood flow associated with relatively larger diameter vessels. Hence, this work utilizes the Pennes bioheat equation for modeling the perfused tissue domain, and the coupled momentum and energy conservation equations for modeling the blood flow. Further, it is worth noting that, out of all the environmental and physical factors the skin blood flow has a major contribution to the heat loss from the body core and can be closely related to the skin temperature and heat loss [23]. Thus, neglecting the blood flow in the model may lead to significant deviation in the resulting thermal images as compared to the clinical thermal images.In this work, the dynamic thermal imaging (DTI) of skin has been carried out with the aid of external thermo-stimulation [5,24]. During DTI, in general, the skin surface (or the patient) is first kept in a stabilized ambient condition for 15–20min [24], so that the skin temperature reaches a steady state value. The obtained thermal map of the skin surface serves as a reference thermal pattern for further evaluation. Next, the skin surface and certain portions of subsurface region are cooled below the reference steady state value using a contact type thermo-stimulation procedure [24] for a short-period. After a certain period of cold stimulus, the contact type stimulation is removed from the skin surface and the skin is allowed to recover to the reference steady state value under the same stabilized ambient condition. During this thermal recovery period, the spatial and temporal variations of temperature values on the skin surface are measured remotely using a thermal camera at different times indicating differential changes in the thermal patterns between the cancerous region and surrounding healthy region. The temperature differences at different instants are mainly due to the thermogenic capacity, metabolism and blood perfusion of the skin lesion against that of the surrounding healthy tissues [24].Further, it is a well-known fact that skin behaves as a black surface and has an emissivity close to unity within the spectral range of 2.5–15μm [25]. Within the mentioned spectral range, there exists a favorable wavelength range (8–10μm) for thermal evaluation of skin since, IR radiation from the skin surface exhibits a maximum peak within this wavelength range [26]. Earlier study has also indicated that IR radiation exhibits nearly 100% transmittance through the atmosphere within the spectral range of 8–10μm [27]. In view of the above facts, it is evident that measuring the skin IR radiation within the spectral range of 8–10μm is advantageous.The detection of melanoma at an early stage using DTI technique is always a formidable challenge due to negligible metabolism and blood perfusion. Further, the early stage remains unresolved in the thermogram since, the thermogenic capacity of regional blood vessels overpowers the lesion response. Therefore, the present work compares the growth of melanoma volume with the thermal response of vascularized skin and evaluates the performance of the DTI technique for early melanoma diagnosis. Further, the objective of this study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis to set an evaluation criterion for the early detection of melanoma. The study involves the development of viable computational method for the outcome prediction of disease during DTI.Human skin consists of four layers, viz., epidermis, dermis, fat and muscle. In each layer of the skin, except epidermis, the flow of blood takes place in the counter-current artery–vein pair arrangement as can be seen fromFig. 1(a). The velocity within the artery is in the positive x-direction and the velocity within the vein is in the negative x-direction. The geometry of the tissue as well as vessels, thermo-physical properties of tissue as well as lesion, and the blood flow parameters have been modeled based on the reported data [12,28,29] and have been tabulated inTable 1. In the present numerical study, the skin has been first subjected to a 60s cold stimulus. After 60s of cooling, the surface has been exposed to the environment and heat exchange takes place due to convection, radiation and evaporation. Upon the removal of undercooled condition, the skin gradually recovers from the cold condition. The thermal response of skin surface has been mapped during this recovery time to individuate the subsurface cancer. The cold stimulus of 60s has been employed on the skin surface to reproduce the work done by Çetingül and Herman [5] and to achieve an initial validation of the present model.The growth of malignant tumors is mainly due to consecutive mitotic division from a single neoplastic cell (typically of the diameter 10μ) [30]. It starts as a single focus and lead to a volume of malignant cells after a certain period of time, represented by the doubling time. The doubling time is the mathematical representation of number of mitotic divisions to reach a certain volume of tumor. Thus, with the help of simple mathematical relation one may determine the stage of malignant tumor based on the knowledge of volume it has acquired. Therefore, in most cancer staging approaches the stage of a malignant tumor is determined based on the change in the effective diameter and the penetration depth of the tumor volume. Thus, the melanoma stages have been modeled in this study by incorporating the growth of tumor volume (viz., lateral spread of the tumor, D and depth of penetration, hp) within the skin [1]. Based on the anatomical invasion of T1 melanoma (less than or nearly equal to 1mm of thickness and no ulceration) in the skin, the three subcategories of melanoma, viz., Clark level II, III and IV have been considered. The melanoma at its early stage before Clark levels is abbreviated as ES I. Fig. 1(b) depicts the visual representation of different stages of cutaneous melanoma. The diameter, D, depth of penetration, hp, blood perfusion, ωband metabolic heat generation,Q″m, of different melanoma stages considered for computations have been detailed inTable 2.Table 3 depicts various intermediate stages of melanoma, which have been modeled by changing the tumor volume from that of the single cell volume of 10 μ diameter sphere equivalent to the volume of the cylindrical lesion (L1). It is worth-noting here that, during the early stages, there exists inter-mitotic resting phase/lag phase between each mitotic division due to limited supply of nutrients and neglogible capillary blood perfusion [30–32]. As a result, the blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation of melanoma at early stages (viz., ES I, L1–L8) are assumed to be zero (referTables 2 and 3). The mitotic division switches to log phase due to rich supply of nutrients followed by the recruitment of large number of vessels. The switch has been assumed to be taking place between L8 and L9. It has also been assumed that, the nutrient supply and metabolism remain nearly constant for stages L9 to L19 during the log phase (referTables 2 and 3), since the growth of malignant volume takes place at a faster rate compared to the further recruitment of vessels. The penetration of melanoma into a portion of the papillary dermis, complete papillary dermis, and a portion of the reticular dermis have been labeled as Clark levels II, III and IV, respectively [1].The numerical study has been carried out by dividing the computational domain into two sub-domains, viz., vascular sub-domain (Ωv) and perfused tissue sub-domain (Ωt). In order to determine the temperature distribution of skin during DTI, the perfused tissue sub-domain has been modeled using Pennes bioheat equation [20] and the vascular sub-domain has been modeled using coupled momentum and energy conservation equations. The governing bioheat equation for perfused tissue within a bounded region Ωtis given by Pennes [20] as(1)ρtct∂Tt∂t=∇⋅[kt∇T]−ωbρbcb[Tt−Ta]+Q″minΩtwhereρt,ct,kt,ωb,ρb,cb,Q″m,Ta,Tt,tare the density of the tissue, the specific heat of the tissue, the thermal conductivity of the tissue, the blood perfusion within the tissue, the density of the blood, the specific heat of the blood, the volumetric heat generation due to metabolism, the arterial blood temperature, the unknown tissue temperature and the time, respectively. Subscripts t, a and b represent tissue, artery and blood, respectively.The continuity, momentum and energy conservation equations for vascular sub-domain, by considering the laminar and incompressible flow, can be written as [33](2)Continuityequation:ρb(∂u∂x+∂v∂y+∂w∂z)=0Momentumequation:ρb(∂u∂t+v→∇⋅u)=−∂P∂x+∂∂x(τxx)+∂∂y(τyx)+∂∂z(τzx)ρb(∂v∂t+v→∇⋅v)=−∂P∂y+∂∂x(τxy)+∂∂y(τyy)+∂∂z(τzy)ρb(∂w∂t+v→∇⋅w)=−∂P∂z+∂∂x(τxz)+∂∂y(τyz)+∂∂z(τzz)+ρbg}inΩv(3)Energyequation:ρbcb∂Tb∂t+v→ρbcb∇Tb=kb∇⋅[∇Tb]+Q″P+Q″v+Q″mbwhere,Q″P=−∇⋅(Pv→)Q″v=u(∂τxx∂x+∂τyx∂y+∂τzx∂z)+v(∂τxy∂x+∂τyy∂y+∂τzy∂z)+w(∂τxz∂x+∂τyz∂y+∂τzz∂z)τxx=λ(∇.v→)+2μ∂u∂x,τyy=λ(∇.v→)+2μ∂v∂y,τzz=λ(∇.v→)+2μ∂w∂zτxy=τyx=μ(∂v∂x+∂u∂y),τxz=τzx=μ(∂u∂z+∂w∂x),τyz=τzy=μ(∂w∂y+∂v∂z)}inΩvwhere u, v and w are the velocities in x, y and z directions respectively,v→is the velocity vector(=ui+vj+wk), τijrepresents the normal and shear viscous stress,λis the second viscosity coefficient(=−(2/3)μ), P is the pressure, μ is the viscosity of blood, g is the acceleration due to gravity, kbis the thermal conductivity of the blood,Tbis the unknown blood temperature,Q″Pis the volumetric heating due to pressure work,Q″vis the viscous dissipation term,Q″mbis the metabolic heat generation of blood and the term ρbg is the body force (buoyancy effect) acting in the vertical direction, z.At the vessel entrance, the fully developed velocity profile, u, in x-direction can be written as(4)u=u0(1−y2+z2r2)where u0 is the uniform velocity at the vessel entrance, r is the radius of the vessel, y and z are the coordinates. On the other hand, at the vessel exit the constant pressure boundary condition has been considered, since this condition is the most suitable choice for blood flow simulation [34]. For a healthy person the pressure of blood within the vessels varies in the range of 70–80/110–120mmHg [34]. Thus, the study considered the pressure of blood at the vessel exit to be 90mmHg [34]. The study also evaluates the effect of fluctuating velocity and pressure boundary condition at the vessel entrance and exit, respectively, on the blood flow parameters. For the illustration purpose, the perturbations in velocity and pressure have been modeled for three cardiac cycles. The rheological properties of the flow have been estimated by considering the non-Newtonian model of blood using Carreau relation [29](5)μ=μ∞+(μ0−μ∞)[1+(λ∂γ∂t)2](n−1)/2whereμ∞is the viscosity at high shear rate which is equal to the value of viscosity given in Table 1,μ0is the value of viscosity at zero shear rate (= 0.056 Pa s),λis the model parameter (= 3.313 s), n is also a model parameter (= 0.3568) and∂γ/∂tis the strain rate. No-slip boundary condition has been assumed at the inner walls of the vessels.Thermal response of the skin during thermal recovery from undercooled condition has been modeled by imposing different boundary conditions. The boundary condition at the datum of the skin (at z=0) (Fig. 1(a)) has been considered to be at a constant core body temperature (Tc) and can be written as(6)T|z=0=Tc=37°Cfort≥0sThe boundary condition for transient thermal cooling of the skin surface (at z=H) can be written as(7)T|z=H=Tsurf,cool=10°Cfor0s≤t≤60swhere H is the total thickness of the skin. The constant temperature cold surface can be achieved either by applying cold gel or contact type cold stimulation. When the surface of the skin is exposed to the environment before and after the transient thermal cooling, the surface heat exchange is considered to be due to natural convection(q″conv), radiation(q″rad)and evaporation(q″evap). Thus, the combined boundary condition at the skin surface can be written as(8)−ktdTdy|z=H=q″s=q″conv+q″rad+q″evapfort=0sandt>60sWith hconv(=10Wm−2K−1) as the convective heat transfer coefficient [5,11], T∞(=22.4°C) as the ambient temperature, the natural convective heat flux(q″conv)is given as(9a)q″conv=hconv(Tsurf−T∞)fort=0sandt>60sand the surface radiative heat flux(q″rad)is expressed as(9b)q″rad=εσ(Tsurf4−T∞4)fort=0sandt>60swhere ε is the emissivity of skin and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (= 5.6704×10−8Wm−2K−4). The present work considers the value of emissivity to be 0.98 [11]. The empirical relations for evaporative heat flux(q″evap)at the skin surface due to sweat secretion are given [35,36] as(9c)q″evap=q″dif+q″rsw=3.054×10−3(256Tsurf−3370−Pa)+16.7×10−3hconvωrsw(256Tsurf−3370−Pa)}fort=0sfort>60swhereq″difis the evaporative heat exchange across the surface of the skin due to diffusion,q″rswis the heat exchange by evaporation due to regulatory sweating,ωrswis the specific humidity of the skin, which lies between 0 and 1 (ωrsw=0 for dry skin andωrsw=1 for completely wet skin),Pais the vapor pressure of the humid air(=ϕaPsat)in Pa, where,ϕais the relative humidity of the moist air andPsatis the saturated pressure of water vapor in the air. Zero heat flux has been considered at the other four extremities/boundaries of the three dimensional skin model, at a distance away from the field of interest. The temperature and heat flux continuity boundary conditions have been considered at the layer interfaces and at the vessel–tissue interfaces.The meshing of physical domain (Fig. 1) has been done using fine tetrahedral mesh elements where the maximum element size for epidermis, papillary dermis, reticular dermis, fat and muscle are 0.02mm, 0.08mm, 0.09mm, 0.2mm and 0.5mm, respectively. Whereas, the minimum element size for the vessel geometries in each layer has been considered to be 0.02mm. The initial temperature of the skin and vessels have been considered to be same as that of the core body temperature, Tc(= 37°C). The metabolic heat generation of blood within the vessels,Q″mbhas been considered to be same as that of the nearby tissue layers. For numerical simulations, the specific humidity of the skin and relative humidity of the moist air have been considered to be 0.2 and 40%, respectively. The saturated pressure of water vapor in the air has been obtained at ambient temperature,T∞(= 22.4°C).The temperature distribution within the skin and the thermal maps have been obtained by solving the Pennes bioheat model (Eq. (1)) and the coupled conservation equations due to blood flow (Eqs. (2) and (3)) using a commercially available finite element based software package. The numerical procedure to obtain the temperature distribution has been discussed as follows:Step I: Initially, the steady-state temperature distributions in the human skin layers have been computed by imposing combined heat flux (Eq. (8)) at the surface of the skin. The steady-state solution has been obtained by simultaneously solving Eqs. (1)–(3).Step II: A transient analysis of coupled Eqs. (1)–(3) has been done by applying a constant temperature cold stress (Eq. (7)) on the skin surface for 60s. The steady-state solution obtained during step I has been provided as the initial guess for the transient analysis.Step III: Eqs. (1)–(3) have been simultaneously solved along with the combined heat flux boundary condition for t>60s. The solution obtained for t=60s has been provided as the initial guess to determine the thermal response of the skin during the thermal recovery (i.e., t>60s). The transient analysis has been performed till the skin reaches steady-state. The thermal recovery from undercooled conditions takes almost 20–30min.
