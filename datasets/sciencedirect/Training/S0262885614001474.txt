@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a novel and effective lip-based biometric identification approach with the Discrete Hidden Markov Model Kernel (DHMMK) is developed. Lips are described by shape features (both geometrical and sequential) on two different grid layouts: rectangular and polar. These features are then specifically modeled by a DHMMK, and learnt by a support vector machine classifier. Our experiments are carried out in a ten-fold cross validation fashion on three different datasets, GPDS-ULPGC Face Dataset, PIE Face Dataset and RaFD Face Dataset. Results show that our approach has achieved an average classification accuracy of 99.8%, 97.13%, and 98.10%, using only two training images per class, on these three datasets, respectively. Our comparative studies further show that the DHMMK achieved a 53% improvement against the baseline HMM approach. The comparative ROC curves also confirm the efficacy of the proposed lip contour based biometrics learned by DHMMK. We also show that the performance of linear and RBF SVM is comparable under the frame work of DHMMK.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Personnel security is becoming increasingly important in today's modern world [1]. Biometric-based access control is one of the most important technologies for cyber–physical security, and has received increasing attention over the past two decades. In the competitive business world of today, the need and demand for a biometric physical security solution have never been higher. The biometric market is increasing each year and this trend is set to continue, due to the increasing need for security at borders, and in buildings, airports, etc. [2]. At its core, it aims to identify a person with one or more of their body features, such as their face, hand, fingerprint, or voice [1–3]. These biometric modalities can be deployed for different applications including; searching for people, remote access control, and secure corridors in airports.To date, there has been a large amount of work done in biometrics, with most of it focusing on using a single biometric mode. Recently, the trend has been to build robust person identification systems based on multimodal approaches, i.e., a combination of biometric features. However, to obtain a robust multimodal solution, it is of benefit to employ individual modalities which have good performance in isolation. Furthermore, there is still much room for improvement with respect to single mode approaches.Human recognition through distinctive facial features supported by an image database is still an appropriate subject of study as already mentioned. We should not forget that this problem still presents various difficulties. For example, what will happen if an individual's haircut is changed? Is make-up a determining factor in the process of verification? Would it significantly distort facial features? For these reasons, the study of different parts of a face still merits investigation in order to improve identification. Consequently, the analysis of lip contours is receiving greater attention [4,5], as it is particularly well-suited to deployment on mobile phone platforms. The importance of lip features as biometrics is reported in [6], where numerous lip-based features are evaluated. Therefore in this work, an approach based on the shape of lips is presented.
