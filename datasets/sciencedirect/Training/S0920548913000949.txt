@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) make use of advanced detection, communications, and computing technology to improve the safety and efficiency of surface transportation networks. An ITS incorporates a variety of equipment and devices all working in mutual harmony. However, each piece of equipment or device has its own data format and protocol so they cannot exchange data with each other directly. In this paper, a platform of data exchange in an ITS is proposed that can receive data from several types of equipment external to automobiles, repackage the received data, and then dispatch the data to different devices inside the vehicles.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) make use of advanced detection, communications, and computing technology to improve the safety and efficiency of surface transportation networks. ITS consists of technological applications and integration that allow system operators and users to better manage and optimize the capacity of a transportation system [20]. ITS allows for the use of information technologies to collect data on the status of highways, traffic signals, transit vehicles, trucks, and trains; and integrates data in ways that affect and improve the operation of the system.ITS has been developed since the beginning of 1970s, which makes human, vehicles, and roads united and harmonic and establishes a wider range, fully efficient, real-time and accurate information management system [11]. The ITS has received much attention in the past few years. That is due to the problems of growing traffic congestion and the need for a synergy of new information technology for simulation, real-time control, and communication networks. Traffic congestion has been increasing worldwide, the result of increased motorization, urbanization, population growth, and changes in population density. Congestion reduces efficiency of transportation infrastructure and increases travel time, air pollution, and fuel consumption [10].ITS applied varying technologies from basic management systems, such as car navigation systems, traffic signal control systems, and container management systems, as well as variable message signs, automatic number plate recognition and speed cameras, to monitoring applications, such as security CCTV systems [6]. There are more advanced applications that integrate live data and feedback from a number of other sources such as parking guidance and information systems, weather information systems, bridge deicing systems, and so forth. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed in order to allow advanced modeling and comparison with historical baseline data.Interest in ITS stems from the problems caused by traffic congestion and the need for a synergy of new information technology for simulation, real-time control, and communications networks [6,10]. Traffic congestion has been increasing worldwide, the result of increased motorization, urbanization, population growth, and changes in population density. Congestion reduces efficiency of transportation infrastructure and increases travel time, air pollution, and fuel consumption.With ITS, devices and equipments are working together. However, each device and piece of equipment has its own data format and protocol, such as GPS, TMC, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth [8,9,16]. They cannot directly exchange data; therefore, a framework has been designed herein to exchange messages between devices and communication systems [6]. In addition, this framework can consolidate variant communication protocols, similar to the web service. Therefore, it can adapt any kind of device for use in a multi-communication system, as well as collect varied information from devices, and send all information to the ITS center for data analysis or for transmission to another vehicle [8].This research employed ITS to design an Integrated Data Exchange Platform (IDEP for short) that includes physical, security, processing and interfacing as its four layers. Each layer includes components working in conjunction to exchange data between equipment and devices in the framework.The second part of this paper deals with underlying challenges and methods; the third part introduces the method and framework of this research; and the fourth part consists of the conclusion and suggestions for future research.
