@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a new finite-element formulation for the dynamic analysis of three-dimensional beams. The formulation is based on the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory in which the strain vectors are the only unknown functions of the arc-length parameter. The classical Newmark time integration scheme extended to the multiplicative group of spatial rotations is used and properly adapted for the strain-based formulation. The Generalized-αmethod is used to enforce a numerical dissipation of higher modes. The update procedure needed in the iteration process is discussed in detail. The exact linearization of the governing equations is also presented. The performance of the formulation is demonstrated with numerical examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the present paper we consider the dynamic behaviour of the beam-like structures in the three-dimensional space. Geometry of the deformed three-dimensional beam is described by the axis of the beam and the cross-sections not necessarily normal to the axis at the deformed state. The configuration space of the beam thus consists of (i) the linear space of the position vector of the axis, and (ii) the non-linear space of rotations of cross-sections. Because the spatial rotations belong to the multiplicative SO(3) group, the configuration space of the beam is a non-linear manifold [1,2]. The non-linearity of spatial rotations considerably dictates both the choice of the finite element formulation of the beam and the time-integration technique.The classical Newmark time integration scheme [3] is widely used in the time discretization of equations of motion in various beam finite-element formulations [4–6,2] and in structural dynamics in general. Yet it is only applicable for vector fields, and cannot be applied to the non-linear rotation fields with no modification. Furthermore, the Newmark time integration scheme is only conditionally stable in non-linear problems A sufficient condition to achieve unconditional stability is the energy decay argument [7–10]. This is why many algorithms have been invented which aim to automatically damp out high frequencies and thus improve the stability of the Newmark scheme. One such highly popular integration scheme is the Generalized-αmethod of Chung and Hulbert [11].Since the pioneering works by Simo and his coworkers [2,12] emerged in eighties and early nineties, many innovative numerical formulations of spatial beams for the dynamic analysis have been proposed, see, e.g. Bottasso and Borri [13], Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4], Jelenić and Crisfield [5], Romero and Armero [14], Mata et al. [15], to list just a few. The choice of displacements and rotations as primary variables in the spatial and time discretization is a common feature of the above cited works. Although the displacements and the rotations appear to be the best choice for the primary variables from the implementation perspective, other aspects like accuracy, stability and robustness count more. An important drawback of the displacement-based formulations is locking. Another weakness of the displacement–rotation based formulations, which also concerns the accuracy of the formulation, is the assumption of the independent interpolations for displacements and rotations, which is in a sharp contrast with the theoretically proven linked interpolation of these mutually dependent quantities [16].Zupan and Saje [17,18] show that the strain-based beam formulation for the static analysis completely avoids the above listed weaknesses by choosing the strain measures as the only spatially interpolated variables. In contrast to the displacements and rotations, which are mutually dependent by the theoretical argument, the translational and rotational strain measures are independent; moreover, they are additive quantities. Hence any additive interpolation of strains is automatically kinematically consistent, and, after integrated, gives fully consistent displacement and rotation fields. This increases the accuracy, stability and robustness of such an approach. A further advantage of the strain-based beam elements is their direct applicability and suitability for the use of wavelet shape functions [19] in the interpolation.The fundamental problem of any strain-based formulation is the integration of rotations from the interpolated rotational strains. In three dimensions, the derivative of the rotational vector with respect to an arc-length parameter equals the product of the rotation-dependent transformation matrix and the rotational strain. Such a system of three differential equations cannot be integrated in a closed form. That is why, in the three-dimensional beam theories, the rotational strain is very rarely chosen as the primary variable. Such formulations, yet only for the linear Timoshenko beam theory, were proposed by Choi and Lim [20] and Friedman and Kosmatka [21], who used a constant interpolation for curvature. Schulz and Filippou [22] interpolated both the infinitesimal (incremental) curvatures and the infinitesimal rotations.The present formulation does a step further and employs the exact non-linear relationship between the rotational strains and the rotations and assumes a polynomial interpolation of the curvature vector of any order. Due to an analytically non-integrable form of the rotation–strain relation, the numerical integration is used in order to obtain the total rotations from the given curvatures. This way a novel space and time discretization for the three-dimensional dynamic analysis of the beam is obtained, in which the strain measures are the only spatially interpolated variables. The time discretization combines the Newmark scheme and the Generalized-αmethod, properly adopted to strains as the new primary unknowns. The spatial discretization is carried out by the collocation method. Such a collocation-strain-based formulation completely avoids the differentiation of the shape functions, which increases the accuracy of the stress-resultants in space and time.In the geometrically exact finite-strain beam theory, the configuration of the three-dimensional beam at an arbitrary time t is described by (see Fig. 1):(i)the arc-length parameter x of the centroidal beam axis connecting the centroids of the cross-sections at the initial configuration,the position vectorr(x,t)of the centroidal beam axis, andthe local coordinate system defined by the orthonormal base vectors{G1(x,t),G2(x,t),G3(x,t)}attached to the centroid of the planes of the cross-sections. VectorsG2(x,t)andG3(x,t)point along the centroidal principal axes of inertia of the cross-section, andG1(x,t)is its normal:G1=G2×G3(note thatG1is generally not colinear with the tangent to the centroidal beam axis,dr/dx).A triad of fixed orthonormal base vectors,{g1,g2,g3}, with the origin at an arbitrary, fixed reference pointOdefines the global coordinate system(X,Y,Z).Abstract vectors will be expressed with respect to either the local or the global basis to obtain their component representation. The vectors are marked by a bold-face font and equipped with an index denoting the basis used. The rotation matrixR(x,t)represents the relationship between the two bases as well as the coordinate transformation between the components of the two representations(1)vg=RvG.The rotational vectorϑgis chosen for the parametrization of three-dimensional rotations. The rotation matrixRand the rotational vectorϑgare related by the Rodrigues formula [23](2)R=I+sinϑϑΘ+1−cosϑϑ2Θ2,whereΘis a skew-symmetric matrix, such that(3)Θu=ϑ×ufor everyu.Iis the identity matrix andϑ=∥ϑg∥is the length of the rotational vector. As in Eq. (3) it is often found convenient to replace the cross product of an arbitrary two vectorsv×uby the matrix productS(v)u, whereS(v)is the skew-symmetric matrix ofv, given by(4)S(v)=[0−v3v2v30−v1−v2v10]=−ST(v).vis called the axial vector of the skew-symmetric matrixS(v).The geometrically exact finite-strain beam theory [24] introduces strain measures(γG,κG)that are consistent with the virtual work principle for any internal forces and any magnitude of deformation.γGis the translational strain vector andκGis the rotational strain vector. The corresponding relations between the variations of kinematic and strain variables are given in [24] and read(5)δγG=RT(δr′g−δϑg×r′g)(6)δκG=RTδϑ′g.The prime(′)denotes the derivative with respect to x. Applying Reissner's [24] approach on Eqs. (5) and (6), we can show that(7)γG=RTr′g+cG(8)κG=TTϑ′g+dGwhere(9)TT=I−1−cosϑϑ2Θ+ϑ−sinϑϑ3Θ2is the matrix representation of the mapping betweenκGandϑ′g. Vector functionscG(x)anddG(x)represent the initial strains in the undeformed state and may depend on x, although their variations are zero, as they do not depend on the deformation of the beam. They enable us to model arbitrary initially curved and twisted beams.The equations of the dynamic equilibrium of the beam, when subjected to external distributed force and moment vectorsngandmg, are derived from the local form of the linear and angular momentum conservation laws as(10)ng=−N′g+ρAr¨g,(11)mg=−M′g−r′g×Ng+RJRTω̇g+ΩRJRTωg.NgandMgare stress-resultant force and moment vectors of the cross-section. Because they satisfy the dynamic equilibrium equations (10) and (11), they are called the equilibrium force and moment.ωgis the angular velocity vector andΩ=S(ωg)the skew-symmetric matrix composed from the components ofωg. The relationship between the angular velocity vector and the derivative of the rotational vector with respect to time is derived from the relationṘRT=Ωand is given by(12)ωg=T(ϑg)ϑ̇g.The dot(̇)denotes the derivative with respect to time t. Note the analogy between (8) and (12) showing that the rotational strain plays the same role with respect to x as the angular velocity does with respect to t. The product of densityρand the area of the cross-section, A, of the beam denotes the mass per unit length of the beam.Jis the centroidal inertia matrix of the cross-section with respect to its principal axes.Jis hence the diagonal matrix with the non-zero componentsJG1>0,JG2>0,JG3>0.The stress-resultants also depend on strain vectorsγGandκG. The relations are assumed to be given formally by the non-linear constitutive equations(13)NGC(x)=CN(γG,κG)(14)MGC(x)=CM(γG,κG).The stress-resultants obtained fromγGandκGrather than from the equilibrium equations (10) and (11) are called the constitutive force and moment. The equilibrium and the constitutive stress-resultants should theoretically be equal; however, this is not automatically true in the numerical solution of the discretized problem. In order to avoid such an inconsistency of the numerical solution, we follow the concept introduced by Vratanar and Saje [25] and explicitly demand the equality of the two kinds of stress-resultants(15)R(x)NGC(x)=Ng(x)(16)R(x)MGC(x)=Mg(x).The problem of the dynamics of the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam subjected to a set of time-dependent external loadsng(x,t),mg(x,t),S0(t),P0(t),SL(t)andPL(t)consists of the following equations:(i)the consistency conditions (15) and (16), the dynamic equilibrium equations (10) and (11) and the kinematic equations (7) and (8)(17)R(x,t)NGC(x,t)−Ng(x,t)=0(18)R(x,t)MGC(x,t)−Mg(x,t)=0(19)N′g(x,t)−ρAr¨g(x,t)+ng(x,t)=0(20)M′g(x,t)−S(Ng(x,t))R(x,t)(γG(x,t)−cG(x))−Ω(x,t)R(x,t)JRT(x,t)ωg(x,t)−R(x,t)JRT(x,t)ω̇g(x,t)+mg(x,t)=0(21)r′g(x,t)−R(x,t)(γG(x,t)−cG(x))=0(22)ϑ′g(x,t)−T−T(ϑg(x,t))(κG(x,t)−dG(x))=0,the boundary conditions(23)Ng(0,t)=−S0(t),Mg(0,t)=−P0(t)(24)Ng(L,t)=SL(t),Mg(L,t)=PL(t)(25)rg(0,t)=rg0(t),ϑg(0,t)=ϑg0(t)(26)rg(L,t)=rgL(t),ϑg(L,t)=ϑgL(t),and the initial conditions(27)rg(x,t0)=rg[0](x),ϑg(x,t0)=ϑg[0](x)(28)ṙg(x,t0)=ṙg[0](x),ϑ̇g(x,t0)=ϑ̇g[0](x).Our final goal is to express the governing equations with the strain vectors only, which will then become the solely interpolated unknown quantities in the numerical formulation. For that purpose the set of Eqs. (19)–(22) is formally integrated along the length of the beam, assuming thatng,mg,γG,κG,r¨g,ωgandω̇gare given functions of x:(29)Ng(x)=Ng0+∫0xρAr¨g(ξ)dξ−∫0xng(ξ)dξ(30)Mg(x)=Mg0+∫0xS(Ng(ξ))R(ξ)(γG(ξ)−cG(ξ))dξ+∫0xS(R(ξ)ωG(ξ))R(ξ)JωG(ξ)dξ+∫0xR(ξ)Jω̇G(ξ)dξ−∫0xmg(ξ)dξ(31)rg(x)=rg0+∫0xR(ξ)(γG(ξ)−cG(ξ))dξ(32)ϑg(x)=ϑg0+∫0xT−T(ϑg(ξ))(κG(ξ)−dG(ξ))dξ.In (30) the angular velocity and acceleration have been substituted with the local basis representations usingωg=RωG,ω̇g=Rω̇GandΩ=S(ωg)=S(RωG). The fulfilment of Eqs. (31) and (32) at x=L places additional requirements on strain vectors(33)rgL−rg0−∫0LR(γG−cG)dx=0(34)ϑgL−ϑg0−∫0LT−T(ϑg)(κG−dG)dx=0.Once the integrals in (29)–(34) are resolved, Eqs. (19)–(22) become satisfied. Hence the remaining governing equations of the strain-based formulation for the dynamic analysis of the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam now consists only of yet unsatisfied equations, i.e. the constitutive equations (17) and (18), the kinematic boundary conditions (33) and (34), the static boundary conditions (23) and (24), and the initial conditions (27) and (28). The system consists of eight vector equations for eight unknown vector quantities: (i) the kinematic vectorsrg0,ϑg0,rgL,ϑgLat x=0 and x=L, (ii) the equilibrium stress resultantsNg0,Mg0at x=0, and (iii) the strain vector functionsγG(x)andκG(x):(35)f1=R(x,t)NGC(x,t)−Ng0(t)+∫0xng(ξ,t)dξ−∫0xρAr¨g(ξ,t)dξ=0(36)f2=R(x,t)MGC(x,t)−Mg0(t)+∫0xmg(ξ,t)dξ−∫0xS(Ng(ξ,t))R(ξ,t)(γG(ξ,t)−cG(ξ))dξ−∫0xS(R(ξ,t)ωG(ξ,t))R(ξ,t)JωG(ξ,t)dξ−∫0xR(ξ,t)Jω̇G(ξ,t)dξ=0(37)f3=rgL(t)−rg0(t)−∫0LR(x,t)(γG(x,t)−cG(x))dx=0(38)f4=ϑgL(t)−ϑg0(t)−∫0LT−T(ϑg(x,t))(κG(x,t)−dG(x))dx=0(39)f5=S0(t)+Ng0(t)=0(40)f6=P0(t)+Mg0(t)=0(41)f7=SL(t)−Ng0(t)+∫0Lng(x,t)dx−∫0LρAr¨g(x,t)dx=0(42)f8=PL(t)−Mg0(t)+∫0Lmg(x,t)dx−∫0LS(Ng(x,t))R(x,t)(γG(x,t)−cG(x))dx−∫0LS(R(x,t)ωG(x,t))R(x,t)JωG(x,t)dx−∫0LR(x,t)Jω̇G(x,t)dx=0.These equations should be supplemented with the auxiliary relations (29)–(32), and the initial conditions (27) and (28). Due to its strong non-linearity, the system is solved numerically.The initial value problem given by (35)–(42) and (27) and (28) is here solved in time by the Newmark time integration scheme. The present approach follows and extends to dynamics the ideas from the static formulation by Zupan and Saje [17].The application of time integrators to three-dimensional beam dynamics is not a straight-forward task. The reason is the multiplicative nature of spatial rotations. Simo and Vu-Quoc [2] were the first to present the extension of classical Newmark's algorithm for the use in the SO(3) group. We will here adapt their extension to the present strain-based formulation. This is not a routine procedure, however, and a special care must be taken to express properly the increments of the kinematic quantities with the incremental strains being the primary quantities of the iteration process in the present formulation.The implicit Newmark time discretization of kinematic quantities for the time interval[tn,tn+1]is summarized by Eqs. (43) and (44), wherevg=ṙgandag=r¨gare the linear velocity and acceleration, andωGandαG=ω̇Gare the angular velocity and acceleration:(43)rg(tn+1)=rg(tn)+ugug=Δtvg(tn)+Δt2[(12−λ)ag(tn)+λag(tn+1)]vg(tn+1)=vg(tn)+Δt[(1−μ)ag(tn)+μag(tn+1)](44)R(tn+1)=R(tn)R(θG)θG=ΔtωG(tn)+Δt2[(12−λ)αG(tn)+λαG(tn+1)]ωG(tn+1)=ωG(tn)+Δt[(1−μ)αG(tn)+μαG(tn+1)].Δtis the time step of the Newmark algorithm.λ∈[0,12]andμ∈[0,1]are free parameters of the method.In order to introduce high frequency dissipation to the time-integration scheme, we follow Chung and Hulbert's Generalized-αmethod [11] and employ it for the present approach. The basic idea is to modify the dynamic equilibrium equations at timetn+1by evaluating the inertial forces at timetn+1−αmand the internal and the external forces at timetn+1−αf.αmandαfare the parameters of the algorithm that define the midpoint times as(45)tn+1−αm=(1−αm)tn+1+αmtn(46)tn+1−αf=(1−αf)tn+1+αftn.As observed from Eqs. (29) and (30), the stress-resultant force and moment vectors can easily be decomposed in an additive manner as(47)Ng(x)=Ngi(x)+Nge(x)+Ngm(x)(48)Mg(x)=Mgi(x)+Mge(x)+Mgm(x),where the superscripts(i),(e),(m)denote the internal, the external and the inertial component, respectively. The details of the decomposition are given in Appendix A. In the present approach, the inertial forces(Ngm,Mgm)are evaluated attn+1−αm, the internal forces(Ngi,Mgi)are evaluated attn+1−αf, and the external forces(Nge,Mge,S0,SL,P0,PL)and the constitutive stress-resultants(NGC,MGC)are evaluated at timetn+1.The time-discrete governing equations then read(49)f1=R(x,tn+1)NGC(x,tn+1)−Ngi(x,tn+1−αf)−Nge(x,tn+1)−Ngm(x,tn+1−αm)=0(50)f2=R(x,tn+1)MGC(x,tn+1)−Mgi(x,tn+1−αf)−Mge(x,tn+1)−Mgm(x,tn+1−αm)=0(51)f3=rgL(tn+1)−rg0(tn+1)−∫0LR(x,tn+1)(γG(x,tn+1)−cG(x))dx=0(52)f4=ϑgL(tn+1)−ϑg0(tn+1)−∫0LT−T(ϑg(x,tn+1))(κG(x,tn+1)−dG(x))dx=0(53)f5=S0(tn+1)+Ng0(tn+1−αf)=0(54)f6=P0(tn+1)+Mg0(tn+1−αf)=0(55)f7=SL(tn+1)−Ngi(L,tn+1−αf)−Nge(L,tn+1)−Ngm(L,tn+1−αm)=0(56)f8=PL(tn+1)−Mgi(L,tn+1−αf)−Mge(L,tn+1)−Mgm(L,tn+1−αm)=0.An arbitrary force(⋅)is evaluated attn+1−αfandtn+1−αmas a linear combination of its values at tnandtn+1:(57)(⋅)(tn+1−αf)=(1−αf)(⋅)(tn+1)+αf(⋅)(tn)(58)(⋅)(tn+1−αm)=(1−αm)(⋅)(tn+1)+αm(⋅)(tn).Alternatively, in the strain-based formulation the forces could also be evaluated directly from the approximate strain fields attn+1−αfandtn+1−αm. The result would differ somewhat due to the non-linearity of the governing equations. Obviously, the present approach is easier to implement.In order to solve the system of Eqs. (49)–(56), we further need to discretize the problem with respect to x. To that end functionsγG(x,t)andκG(x,t)are replaced by the set of their unknown discrete values at given points xp,p=1,…,Nand interpolated by a set of N interpolation functions Ip(x) as(59)γG(x,t)=∑p=1NIp(x)γGp(t)(60)κG(x,t)=∑p=1NIp(x)κGp(t).Since the strains are additive, the same additive interpolation as above can be used for the variations ofγGandκG:(61)δγG(x,t)=∑p=1NIp(x)δγGp(t)(62)δκG(x,t)=∑p=1NIp(x)δκGp(t).The interpolation of unknown strain vectors represents the ground for discretization of the governing equations (49) and (50). As in Zupan and Saje [17], we here choose a collocation-type of the discretization and satisfy the continuous equations (49) and (50) with respect to x in a point-wise manner at N pre-selected points xq,q=1,…,Nto obtain a set of matrix equations(63)f1q=R(xq,tn+1)NGC(xq,tn+1)−Ngi(xq,tn+1−αf)−Nge(xq,tn+1)−Ngm(xq,tn+1−αm)=0(64)f2q=R(xq,tn+1)MGC(xq,tn+1)−Mgi(xq,tn+1−αf)−Mge(xq,tn+1)−Mgm(xq,tn+1−αm)=0.Eqs. (51)–(56) and (63) and (64) constitute2N+6discrete non-linear vector equations for the primary unknowns:rg0,ϑg0,rgL,ϑgL,Ng0,Mg0,κGpandγGp,p=1,…,N, at timetn+1.We solve the non-linear system of Eqs. (63) and (64), (51)–(56) by the iterative Newton method, which requires the linearization of discrete equations about the current deformed configuration. Let us assume that all the quantities at the current iteration step i of the configuration at timetn+1, here denoted by(·)i, are known. The solution of linearized governing equations gives the iterative updates of the primary variables:δri,g0,δϑi,g0,δri,gL,δϑi,gL,δNi,g0,δMi,g0,δγi,Gipandδκi,Gip,p=1,…,N. In order to employ the Newmark time integration scheme in the strain-based formulation, we have to express the iterative updates of the kinematic and dynamic quantities with the iterative variations of the primary unknowns.From the non-linearity of the three-dimensional rotations follows that the variations of the rotational quantities are not necessarily equal to their updates. In order to satisfy the kinematic boundary conditions, iterative updates of rotational vectors are taken to coincide with their variations, while the rotational strain vector updates need to be obtained with respect to the exact (non-varied) kinematic equations. From the kinematic equation (6) it follows:(65)δϑi,g(x)=δϑi,g0+∫0xRi(ξ)δκi,Gi(ξ)dξ.The additive, kinematically admissible update of the rotational strain vector follows from (8) and reads(66)δAκi,Gi=TT(RiTδϑi,g)δκi,Gi.The derivation of relationship (66) can be found in [17].Note that the displacements, stress-resultants and translational strains are additive quantities so that their updates are equal to their variations and thus can simply be added to the current values. The updates of the rotational vectors are performed in accordance with the multiplicative nature of rotations. The update procedure of the primary variables is summarized in Table 1.The rotational vectorsϑi+1,g0andϑi+1,gLare obtained fromRi+1,g0andRi+1,gLby the use of the Spurrier algorithm [26] after the boundary rotation matrix updates have been completed. Iterative updates of displacements at an arbitrary point of the axis of the beam can be obtained in two equivalent ways:(i)From the total strains we obtain the total iterative displacements according to (31)ri+1,g(x)=ri+1,g0+∫0xRi+1(ξ)(γi+1,Gi+1(ξ)−cGi+1(ξ))dξ.The iterative update is then obtained as the difference between the two iterative values(67a)δri,g(x)=ri+1,g(x)−ri,g(x).As the displacements are additive, their updates can also be directly obtained from the variational form of the kinematic equation (5)(67b)δri,g(x)=δri,g0+∫0xRi(ξ)δγi,Gi(ξ)dξ−∫0xS(Ri(ξ)(γi,Gi(ξ)−cGi(ξ)))δϑi,g(ξ)dξ.The total current rotations at any point on the beam axis can also be obtained in two ways:(i)Directly by updating the total rotation matrix in iteration i(68)Ri+1(x)=R(ϑi+1,g(x))=R(δϑi,g(x))Ri(x)or by updating the rotation matrix at time tn(69)Ri+1(x)=R(θi+1,g(x))R(x,tn).The updates of the iterative velocities and accelerations follow those of Simo and Vu-Quoc [2]. The translational quantities are updated by Eq. (43). Expressions forrg(tn+1)andvg(tn+1)are written at the two successive iteration steps i andi+1and subtracted to give(71)δri,g=ri+1,g−ri,g(72)vi+1,g=vi,g+μλΔtδri,g(73)ai+1,g=ai,g+1λΔt2δri,g.Similarly, the subtraction of the terms in (44) when written at the two successive iterations i andi+1gives(74)ωi+1,Gi+1=ωi,Gi+μλΔt(θi+1,Gi+1−θi,Gi)(75)αi+1,Gi+1=αi,Gi+1λΔt2(θi+1,Gi+1−θi,Gi).In (74) and (75) the subtraction of incremental rotations takes place in the tangent space at the pointR(tn)(see [2] for details). Vectorsθi+1,Gi+1andθi,Gidescribe the rotations from the basisG(tn)to the basesGi+1(tn+1)andGi(tn+1), respectively. That is why they have identical component representations in both bases(76)θi+1,Gi+1=θi+1,G(tn)=RT(tn)θi+1,g(77)θi,Gi=θi,G(tn)=RT(tn)θi,g.The difference of the successive incremental rotational vectors can hence be written as(78)θi+1,Gi+1−θi,Gi=RT(tn)(θi+1,g−θi,g)and is here denoted byDθi,Gi. It is observed that the updates in (74) and (75) are additive rather than multiplicative. This will further be discussed in Section 5.4.The Newton iteration method is used for the numerical solution of the governing equations at each discrete time. This requires the linearization of equations. For that purpose the equations are varied about an iterative configuration in ‘directions’δrg0,δϑg0,δrgL,δgL,δNg0,δMg0,δγGpandδκGp,p=1,…,N. To simplify the notation, the indices marking the timetn+1and the iteration number are omitted in what follows.It is found convenient, if the variations of some quantities are prepared in advance. The variations of the rotational vector and the position vector are obtained by the integration of (weak) kinematic equations (5) and (6):(79)δϑg(x)=δϑg0+∫0xR(ξ)δκG(ξ)dξ(80)δrg(x)=δrg0+∫0xR(ξ)δγG(ξ)dξ−∫0xS(R(ξ)(γG(ξ)−cG(ξ)))δϑg(ξ)dξ.With the discretization as assumed in Eqs. (61) and (62), we are able to rewrite the above integrals in the forms which are linear inδγGpandδκGp,p=1,2,…,N. The integrals containingδγGpandδκGpthen read∫0xR(ξ)δγG(ξ)dξ=∑p=1NWp(x)δγGp∫0xR(ξ)δκG(ξ)dξ=∑p=1NWp(x)δκGp,whereWp(x)=∫0xR(ξ)Ip(ξ)dξ.Now the variations of the rotational vector and the position vector can be written as(81)δϑg(x)=δϑg0+∑p=1NWp(x)δκGp(82)δrg(x)=δrg0−U(x)δϑg0−∑p=1NVp(x)δκGp+∑p=1NWp(x)δγGp,where the matricesUandVpare defined as(83)U(x)=∫0xS(R(ξ)(γG(ξ)−cG(ξ)))dξ(84)Vp(x)=∫0xS(R(ξ)(γG(ξ)−cG(ξ)))Wp(ξ)dξ.Variations of the velocity and the acceleration follow directly from (72) and (73):(85)δvg(x)=μλΔtδrg(x)(86)δag(x)=1λΔt2δrg(x),whereδrgis expressed with the variations of the primary unknowns by Eq. (82).The variation of the rotation matrix is obtained by the directional derivative as(87)δR=ddε|ε=0R(εδϑg)R(ϑg).AfterR(εδϑg)is expressed by Eq. (2), the derivative with respect toεperformed and the result evaluated atε=0, we get the well known result(88)δR=δΘR.Eq. (88) defines the kinematically admissible variation of the rotation matrix which is consistent with its multiplicative update. It is useful to observe that the variation of the rotation matrix applied to an arbitrary vectorucan be written in several forms(89)δRu=δΘRu=δϑg×Ru=−S(Ru)δϑg.As already observed, the updates of angular velocities and accelerations in (74) and (75) are additive. Similarly, it is possible to introduce an additive rotational vector [1]. It is well known that such an additive variation of the rotational vector, denoted byδϕ, is related to the multiplicative variation of the rotational vector,δϑg, by the requirement(90)ddε|ε=0R(ϑ+εδϕ)=δΘR,which yields(91)ϕ=T−1(ϑ)δϑ.The linear operatorThas already been introduced in Eq. (9) in a very different context, see Eq. (8). The detailed derivation of this important result can be found in [27,1] or [2]. Result (91) is now employed to evaluate the variation of the difference of the incremental rotational vectors (78). From (78) we have(92)θi+1,g=θi,g+R(tn)Dθi,Gi.Considering (92) in (70) we obtain(93)R(θi,g+R(tn)Dθi,Gi)=R(δϑi,g)R(θi,g).When in (93) both additiveR(tn)Dθi,Giand multiplicativeδϑi,gupdates are multiplied by a scalar parameterε, the directional derivative takes the same form as in (90). Thus we can conclude that(94)δ(R(tn)Dϑi,Gi)=T−1(θi,g)δϑi,g.Employing the above result and Eq. (81) in the linearization of Eqs. (74) and (75) yields(95)δωG=μλΔtRT(tn)T−1(θg)(δϑg0+∑p=1NWpδκGp)=μλΔtRTT−T(θg)(δϑg0+∑p=1NWpδκGp)(96)δαG=1λΔt2RT(tn)T−1(θg)(δϑg0+∑p=1NWpδκGp).=1λΔt2RTT−T(θg)(δϑg0+∑p=1NWpδκGp).The variation of the constitutive equations, (13) and (14), results in the partial derivatives of material operatorsCNandCMwith respect to the components ofγGandκG. The corresponding matrices of the partial derivatives are denoted byCγγ=[∂CiN∂γj],Cγκ=[∂CiN∂κj]Cκγ=[∂CiM∂γj],Cκκ=[∂CiM∂κj].The matrixC=[CγγCκγCγκCκκ]describes the combined material and geometric properties of the cross-section and is hence called the tangent constitutive matrix of the cross-section of the beam. The variations of the constitutive forces are then:δNGC=CγγδG+CγκδκGandδMGC=CκγδγG+CκκδκG. The linearization of discrete equations (63) and (64) requires the variations of the constitutive forces in the global basis to be derived. With the help of expressions (81) and (89) we obtain(97)δ(RNGC)=−S(RNGC)δϑg0−S(RNGC)∑p=1nWpδκGp+∑p=1nIpRCγγδγGp+∑p=1nIpRCγκδκGp(98)δ(RMGC)=−S(RMGC)δϑg0−S(RMGC)∑p=1nWpδκGp+∑p=1nIpRCκγδγGp+∑p=1nIpRCκκδκGp.The linearization of the stress-resultant forces and moments is performed in accordance with their decomposition (47) and (48). The details are presented in Appendix A, so that only the results are summarized here. Based on the expressions (81), (82), (86), (89), (95) and (96), the linearizations of the components of the stress-resultants at timetn+1can formally be expressed as(99)δNgi=δNg0(100)δNge=0(101)δNgm=N˜rmδrg0+N˜ϑmδϑg0+∑p=1nN˜κ,pmδκGp+∑p=1nN˜γ,pmδγGp(102)δMgi=δMg0+M˜NiδNg0+M˜ϑiδϑg0+∑p=1nM˜κ,piδκGp+∑p=1nM˜γ,piδγGp(103)δMge=M˜ϑeδϑg0+∑p=1nM˜κ,peδκGp+∑p=1nM˜γ,peδγGp(104)δMgm=M˜rmδrg0+M˜ϑmδϑg0+∑p=1nM˜κ,pmδκGp+∑p=1nM˜γ,pmδγGp.The matricesN˜andM˜are given in Appendix A. The application of the Generalized-αscheme requires also the linearization of the forces evaluated at timestn+1−αfandtn+1−αm. From the approximations assumed in (57) and (58), we haveδ(·)(tn+1−αf)=(1−αf)δ(·)(tn+1)δ(·)(tn+1−αm)=(1−αm)δ(·)(tn+1),for any component force(·)ior(·)m.After having finished the above preparations, we are now able to express the variations of discrete equations (63) and (64), (51)–(56). They constitute the linearized system of discrete equations of the beam, which is, when expressed with respect to the variations of the basic variablesδrg0,δϑg0,δrgL,δϑgL,δNg0,δMg0,δκGpandδγGp(p=1,…,N), as follows:δf1q=−(1−αm)N˜rm(xq)δrg0−[S(R(xq)NGC(xq))+(1−αm)N˜ϑm(xq)]δϑg0−(1−αf)δNg0+∑p=1N[Ip(xq)R(xq)Cγκ(xq)−S(R(xq)NGC(xq))Wp(xq)−(1−αm)N˜κ,pm(xq)]δκGp+∑p=1N[Ip(xq)R(xq)Cγγ(xq)−(1−αm)N˜γ,pm(xq)]δγGpδf2q=−(1−αm)M˜rm(xq)δrg0−[S(R(xq)MGC(xq))+(1−αf)M˜ϑi(xq)+M˜ϑe(xq)+(1−αm)M˜ϑm(xq)]δϑg0−(1−αf)M˜Ni(xq)δNg0−(1−αf)δMg0+∑p=1N[Ip(xq)R(xq)Cκκ(xq)−S(R(xq)MGC(xq))Wp(xq)−(1−αf)M˜κ,pi(xq)−M˜κ,pe(xq)−(1−αm)M˜κ,pm(xq)]δκGp+∑p=1N[Ip(xq)R(xq)Cκγ(xq)−(1−αf)M˜γ,pi(xq)−M˜γ,pe(xq)−(1−αm)M˜γ,pm(xq)]δγGpδf3=−δrg0+δrgL+U(L)δϑg0+∑p=1NVp(L)δκGp−∑p=1NWp(L)δγGpδf4=−δϑg0+δϑgL−∑p=1NWp(L)δκGpδf5=(1−αf)δNg0δf6=(1−αf)δMg0δf7=−(1−αm)N˜rm(L)δrg0−(1−αm)N˜ϑm(L)δϑg0−(1−αf)δNg0−∑p=1N(1−αm)N˜γ,pm(L)δγGp−∑p=1N(1−αm)N˜κ,pm(L)δκGpδf8=−(1−αm)M˜rm(L)δrg0−[(1−αf)M˜ϑi(L)+M˜ϑe(L)+(1−αm)M˜ϑm(L)]δϑg0−(1−αf)M˜Ni(L)δNg0−(1−αf)δMg0−∑p=1N[(1−αf)M˜γ,pi(L)+M˜γ,pe(L)+(1−αm)M˜γ,pm(L)]δγGp−∑p=1N[(1−αf)M˜κ,pi(L)+M˜κ,pe(L)+(1−αm)M˜κ,pm(L)]δκGp.We present several numerical examples to assess the validity and performance of the present formulation. In the first examples we consider a simple structure with existing analytical solution. Next, we consider the dynamic behaviour of several highly flexible beam-like structures undergoing large displacements and rotations. We show that the proposed formulation is fully capable of reproducing the results of other formulations. With the last example we show the true strength of the proposed formulation when material non-linearity is considered. We highlight the importance of the consistency conditions being satisfied, which is the unique property of proposed formulation.The strain-objectivity, path independence and insensibility to shear locking are inherited from the static approach and therefore not discussed here. For these important issues the reader is referred to the papers [17,18]. The convergence of the discretized constant-strain-based solution with the increasing number of elements to the exact nonlinear solution was also proved, see [28]. A linear elastic material is employed in a first set of examples for which the relationships between the constitutive forces and strains are defined byNGC=[EA1000GA2000GA3]γG,MGC=[GI1000EI2000EI3]κG.E and G denote elastic and shear moduli of material; A1 is the cross-sectional area; I1 is the centroidal torsional inertial moment of the cross-section; A2 and A3 are the effective shear areas in the principal inertial directionsG2andG3of the cross-section; I2 and I3 are the bending centroidal inertial moments of the cross-section about its principal directionsG2andG3. In the last example, where the material non-linearity is considered, the constitutive axial force and bending moments are given by well known relationsNG1C=∬Aσ(ε(y,z))dydz,MG2C=∬Azσ(ε(y,z))dydz,MG3C=∬Ayσ(ε(y,z))dydz.ε(y,z)=γG1−yκG2+zκG3is the extensional strain at an arbitrary cross-sectional point(y,z), andσis the corresponding stress. The linear constitutive model for the shear forces and the torsional moment is assumed, such thatNG2C=GA2γG2,NG3C=GA3γG3andMG1C=GI1κG1.For the evaluation of integrals in the tangent matrix and in the residual vector, the classical Gaussian numerical integration is used, where an integral is replaced by a weighted sum. To optimize the computations and to enhance the accuracy of the numerical integration, we make the collocation points and the interpolation points to be coincident with the integration points. For the integration over the whole length of the element, the Gaussian quadrature is implemented. Local integrals between the two integration points are needed in the evaluation of nested integrals. A combination of the recursive trapezoidal rule and the Gaussian integration is used for the evaluation of these local integrals. See Appendix B for more details.We used the Euclidean norm of the vector of the nodal unknowns∥δy∥and the residual vector∥f∥to assess the accuracy of the results achieved in each iteration step. The iteration was terminated when the prescribed tolerances∥δy∥≤10−10and∥f∥≤10−8were fulfilled.When the non-dissipated solution is sought by the Newmark scheme, the optimal time integration parametersμandλshould take the values12and14, respectively. Otherwise the time integration parametersμ,λ,αmandαfother than12and14are assumed. They are functions of the user-specified value of the spectral radius at infinite sampling frequency,ρ∞∈[0,1]. These functions were presented in [11] and readαm=2ρ∞−1ρ∞+1,λ=14(1−αm+αf)2,αf=ρ∞ρ∞+1,μ=12−αm+αf.In order to assess the performance of the present implementation of the Generalized-αscheme we consider highly stiff pendulum shown in Fig. 2. The so-called Simple Pendulum problem was studied by many authors, among which, Kuhl and Crisfield [10] used it to demonstrate the performance of various time integration schemes, including Generalized-αmethod.The circular motion of the pendulum is initiated by tangential velocityvX0=7.72. The pendulum is modelled with four finite elements, with linear interpolation of strains. The simulation of motion is calculated with three different time steps:Δt=0.1,Δt=0.05andΔt=0.025employing the Newmark scheme and the Generalized-αscheme with the parameterρ∞set to 0.8 and 0.6. Due to the high stiffness of the pendulum, we can compare our results with the exact solutions for rigid pendulum. The exact solutions for the components of the position vector and the velocity vector of the tip of the rigid pendulum readrX(L,t)=LsinvX0Lt,rZ(L,t)=−LcosvX0Lt,vX(L,t)=vX0cosvX0Lt,vZ(L,t)=vX0sinvX0Lt.Fig. 3shows the total energy of the pendulum on the time interval [0,30] and confirms the findings presented in [10, Fig. 6]. For every time step the analysis with the Newmark scheme eventually becomes unstable which results in oscillations and growth of the total energy. It is also confirmed that the use of the Generalized-αscheme itself does not assure the stability of the time integration. For the given time step, the time integration parameters must be carefully chosen to obtain stable integration with energy dissipation. However, the use of the numerical dissipation can greatly affect the accuracy of the results. Figs. 4 and 5show the absolute errors of the displacements and velocities, computed withρ∞=0.6, in comparison with the exact solutions for rigid pendulum. We can conclude that the use of larger time steps together with numerical dissipation could lead to inaccurate results. The accuracy of results is improved by using smaller time steps.This example was first presented by Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4]. A straight beam is initially placed in the XY plane (Fig. 6). The support at one end of the beam allows the translation in the Z-direction and the rotation about the Z-direction. ForceFZand momentMZact simultaneously at the supported end throughout the time interval [0,2.5]. The length of the beam is L=10. Geometrical and material properties of the cross-section areEA1=GA2=GA3=104,GI1=EI2=EI3=103,ρA=1,J1=20,J2=J3=10.The model of the beam consists of 10 linear finite elements with the linear variation of strains. We observe the motion of the beam from t=0 to t=50. We ran the simulation using the Newmark scheme with the time step taken the same as in [4]:Δt=0.5. The free-end displacements of the beam are compared with the results by Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4] in Fig. 7. The present displacements in the X and Y directions are in very good agreement with those presented in [4].The total energy for this problem is presented in Fig. 8for longer time interval [0,100]. We can observe that for long-term calculations with relatively long time steps a growth of energy might be expected when using the Newmark method. For finer meshes such instability occurs later. The use of the Generalized-αscheme for this problem results in a stable behaviour of the total energy.We study the right-angle cantilever first presented by Simo and Vu-Quoc [2]. The cantilever shown in Fig. 9is initially at rest in the XZ-plane. An out-of-plane point loadFYis applied at the elbow. The load is acting as a triangular pulse from t=0 to t=2 reaching its maximum value FY=50 at t=1. Geometric and material properties of the cantilever are taken to be the same as in [2]:L=10,EA1=GA2=GA3=106,GI1=EI2=EI3=103,ρA=1,J1=20,J2=J3=10.Fig. 10presents the displacements in the out-of-plane direction Y of the elbow and the free-end, for the time intervalt∈[0,30]. Two finite-element meshes with 4 (two per each beam) and 20 (10 per each beam) straight elements with the quadratic interpolation of strains were considered. The Newmark scheme was used and a constant time stepΔt=0.25, as in [2], was kept throughout the entire calculation. The results for both meshes were essentially the same. From Fig. 10 we can conclude that the present results well reproduce the results of Simo and Vu-Quoc [2].The total energy increases rapidly while the external forces are applied, see Fig. 11. After the external forces are removed from the system, the energy remains almost constant for smaller time stepΔt=0.1. For larger time steps the total mechanical energy oscillates about the constant value. These oscillations result in the loss of stability for long-term calculations.This classical example of Simo and Vu-Quoc [2] involves extremely large displacements. A straight beam of length L=10 is initially placed in the XZ-plane in an inclined position. The initial coordinates of the end points of the centroidal axis are (6,0,0) and (0,0,8) (Fig. 12). A concentrated forceFXand a torque with componentsMYandMZare applied at the lower end of the beam. The time variation of the applied loads is presented in Fig. 12. Geometrical and material properties of the cross-section of the beam areEA1=GA2=GA3=10000,GI1=EI2=EI3=500,ρA=1,J1=J2=J3=10.We model the beam with 10 elements each having 2 internal points. A constant time stepΔt=0.1was chosen for the entire analysis performed with the Newmark time integration scheme. A sequence of deformed shapes of the beam during early stages of motion are projected on the XZ and YZ planes in Fig. 13. The plots are much alike to those presented in [2, Figs. 17 and 19]. A perspective view of the deformed shapes of the beam for the time intervalt∈[0,15]is depicted in Fig. 14.Roughly at t=16 the analysis starts suffering a rapid growth of the mechanical energy, leading to the loss of convergence of the Newton method. Simo et al. [12] experienced a similar behaviour. The growth of the mechanical energy in the present analysis is mainly due to the high frequency oscillations of the stress-resultants. In order to obtain a stable solution, we employed the Generalized-αscheme. We study the influence of the value of the spectral radiusρ∞and the size of the time stepΔton the long term response of the beam. The simulations were run with the time steps:Δt=0.1,Δt=0.01andρ∞set to:ρ∞=0.5andρ∞=0.9. Figs. 15 and 16report the results for the displacements of the loaded end of the beam and the mechanical energy of the beam, respectively. We can observe that the spectral radius influences the dissipation of the energy during the early stages of motion when the high frequency noise occurs. Thereafter the decay of the total mechanical energy of the beam remains small. The decay of the energy is smaller if a shorter time step is used. The two observed parameters, particularly the size of the time step, have a substantial influence on the displacements of the beam.The swing composed from a flexible horizontal beam with a concentrated mass attached, and rigid links (Fig. 17) was originally analysed by Bauchau and Theron [7] and later on by Ibrahimbegović and Mamouri [8,9]. A mass m=0.5 is rigidly connected to the horizontal flexible beam. The material and geometric properties of the beam areE=73×109,G=28.08×109,ρ=2700,h=0.005,b=0.001,L=0.72.The high rigidity of the links is modelled by setting their Young's modulus 100-times the value of the modulus of the beam. The mass of the rigid links is neglected and the-cross section of the links is taken to be the same as the cross section of the flexible beam. The hinges connecting the rigid links with the horizontal beam allow for free rotation about the Y-axis. The swing is put into a planar motion by a point forceFX, applied at the midspan of the flexible beam. The force is acting as a triangular pulse over the period [0,0.256] with the peakFX=2at t=0.128. The finite-element mesh of the structure consists of 40 six-node elements, of which 4 elements are used to model the rigid links and 32 elements the flexible beam.Two simulations with time stepsΔt=0.0005andΔt=0.0001, respectively, were carried out using the Generalized-αscheme withρ∞=0.5for the time intervalt∈[0,2.5].Motion of the swing is illustrated in Fig. 18by the sequence of the deformed shapes depicted inΔt=0.1time intervals, until t=1. Smooth motion of the system is interrupted when the rigid link on the right-hand side reverses the direction of motion. The event occurs at t=0.641 and results in a highly oscillatory response of the flexible beam. The displacements of the observation point B on the beam are shown in Fig. 19and agree well with the results presented in [7–9].The two analyses give essentially the same results for the displacements. The time histories of the mechanical energy for the two analyses are presented in Fig. 20, where the time history of the energy for the analysis with the energy conserving/decaying scheme, presented in [9], is also shown. We can observe a sudden loss of energy at the time of the critical event which triggers high frequency oscillations. After the high frequencies are damped out, the rate of decay of the energy remains small until the end of the simulation. As expected, the decay of the mechanical energy is smaller for the analysis with the time stepΔt=0.0001.To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our model in the presence of non-linear algebraic constraints, we study the four-bar mechanism problem proposed by Bauchau [29] among a set of benchmark test for flexible beam dynamics. The mechanism depicted in Fig. 21consists of three bars initially lying in the XY-plane connected to each other by revolute joints and supported at points A and B. Both supports allow only the rotation about the Z-direction. The axes of rotation of the revolute joints at points A, B and D are normal to the plane of the mechanism. In order to simulate the initial imperfection of the system, the axis of rotation of the revolute joint at point C is inclined with respect to the normal axis. The angle between the axis of the joint C and the normal axis is taken to beφ=5°. A constant angular velocityωAis applied at point A. The initial inclination of the joint results in three-dimensional response of the system with large internal forces.In modelling of revolute joints we follow [30] and introduce the kinematic constraints, which are enforced to the system of governing equations by Lagrange multiplier method.The geometric and material properties of the mechanism are taken from [29] and are as follows:E=207×109,ν=0.3,ρ=7800L=0.12,b1=0.16,b2=0.008.The prescribed angular velocity at point A isωA=0.6.The simulation was carried out with the time stepΔt=0.004, until t=12. As in [29] we selected the parameters of the Generalized-αscheme according to the spectral radius at infinite frequencyρ∞=0. Some of the results of the simulation are presented in Fig. 22and are in perfect agreement with the reference ones [29]. Despite large displacements, rotations and internal forces of the system, we were able to produce accurate results using only one finite element with cubic interpolation of strains for each bar. The analyses with the values of spectral radius at infinite frequency between 0 and 0.9 were also carried out and gave almost identical results as forρ∞=0.The present finite-element formulation imposes the consistent equilibrium at the predefined number of the cross-sections of the beam. To demonstrate the importance of satisfying the equality of the equilibrium and constitutive stress-resultants, we study Foure's concrete column [31] and compare the numerical results of the present consistent formulation with the formulation where the consistency conditions (17) and (18) are satisfied only in their weak form.The reinforced concrete column (Fig. 23) tested by Fouré was clamped at one end and subjected to an eccentric axial point loadFat the free end. The load was rapidly increased until the failure of the column. We model the reinforced concrete using the bilinear constitutive law of reinforcing steel and the stress–strain law for concrete proposed by Desayi and Krishnan [32]:σ(ε)={0,ε≤εu2fm|ε1|εε12−ε2,εu<ε≤00,ε>0,where fmis the compressive strength of concrete,ε1is the strain at the peak stress of concrete andεuis the ultimate compressive strain of concrete. The geometric and material properties of the column given in [31] areL=225cm,h=20cm,fm=3.83kN/cm2e=1.5cm,b=15cm,fsy=46.5kN/cm2.fsyis the yield strength of the reinforcing bars. The diameter of the bars was 1.2cm and the concrete cover was 1.4cm. We estimated the remaining material parameters of the concrete and steel based on their strength:ε1=−0.0025,εsy=0.02εu=−0.008,Es=20000kN/cm2ρ=2.5×10−6t/cm3,Ep=0.εsyis the strain at yield stress of steel and Esis the elastic and Epthe hardening modulus of steel. We ran the dynamic simulation of the test on the time intervalt∈[0,500s], with the time stepΔt=1s. The initial load,F0=1kN, was linearly increasing with time:F=F0t. Five quadratic elements were used to model the column.The load deflection curve of the top of the column is shown in Fig. 24. The results of our simulation are close to the experimental values and the results of Kanstad [33]. We can observe only a small difference between the results computed with the consistent formulation and those computed with the weak formulation of consistency conditions.We now focus on the results for the stress-resultants. Figs. 25 and 26show the difference of the constitutive and the equilibrium axial force and bending moment for the two load levels: (a) F=100kN where the concrete is still in the elastic zone, and (b) F=460kN where the concrete is close to failure. We can observe that the effect of the inconsistency of the stress resultants is negligible if material behaves elastically. On the other hand, differences between the equilibrium and constitutive stress resultants can be observed if material becomes nonlinear.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented a new finite-element formulation for the dynamic analysis of the geometrically exact spatial beam theory, based on the interpolation of strain vectors. The essential points of this strain-based formulation are as follows:(i)The strain-based formulation employs strain vectors as the only functions that need to be interpolated. As it has been proved in our previous work on the static analysis [17,18], such a formulation is strain-objective, path independent, locking-free and has advantages in describing materially non-linear problems.The present paper shows how to extend the strain-based statics formulation to dynamics. Two different time integrators are implemented: the classical Newmark scheme and the Generalized-αscheme.Apart from the strain interpolation issue, a further distinctive characteristic of the present finite-element formulation is the satisfaction of the consistency condition that the equilibrium and the constitutive internal force and moment vectors are equal at the given set of points (the ‘collocation’-type of the consistency). As the determination of the internal force and moment vectors in the strain-based formulation requires no differentiation, the accuracy of the internal force and moment vectors is of the same order as the accuracy of the basic variables (strains). As demonstrated, this is of utmost importance in materially non-linear problems.Both time-integration schemes studied here are implicit and hence require the linearization of the discretized governing equations to be done in each iteration. The linearizations are not trivial however. The exact analytical linearizations are derived and consistent update procedures needed in each Newton iteration step are discussed in the context of the strain-based finite element beam dynamics for the first time.Several numerical problems were presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model. The limitations of the employed time-integration schemes were also shown and discussed. With numerical dissipation using Generalized-αmethod stable time integration can be reached, but not for any choice of parameters.
