@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we derive the analytical structure of the interval type-2 fuzzy proportional – integral – derivative (IT2F-PID) controller, which consists of a parallel combination of the IT2F-PD controller and the IT2F-PI controller. The IT2F-PID controller uses the following identical elements: two interval T2 triangular input fuzzy sets for each of the two input variables, three interval triangular output fuzzy sets, the Mamdani interval type-2 fuzzy rule based, a Zadeh AND T-norm, a Lukasiewicz OR T-conorm, and a new method for type-reduction that we propose, which called simplified type-reduction method. This new method of type-reduction reduces the computational cost of the output processing for the interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2-FLC). We relate the resulting structure to conventional PID control theory and prove that the proposed IT2F-PID controller is a nonlinear PID with variable gains changing as the input variables values vary. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the IT2F-PID control system have established using the well-known small gain theorem. The simulation results show that the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method is able to improve the system performance compared with other type-reduction methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fuzzy logic systems (type-1 fuzzy logic controllers, T1-FLSs) have successfully applied in many fields [1–5]. The T1-FLS introduced to handle the uncertainties in real systems, but it has demonstrated to be limited in handling the uncertainties of the fuzzy membership sets. So, the type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2-FLS), in which type-2 fuzzy sets (T2-FSs) act as antecedent sets or consequent sets, was introduced to overcome the limitations of T1-FLS [6]. The FLSs that are described with at least one T2-FS are called T2-FLSs [7]. It has also been shown that T2-FSs are much more powerful to handle uncertainties and nonlinearities directly [8]. The major problem with the T2-FLS is that the computations are much more complicated compared to the T1-FLSs. Therefore, Mendel [7] has been proposed a special type of T2-FS called interval T2-FSs (IT2-FSs) in which the output of interval type-2 fuzzy is uncertain with an interval. The interval T2-FLSs (IT2-FLSs) has been successfully implemented in controller design [9–26]. These efforts focus on the controllers that have been used as black box controllers in that their input–output mathematical relations are unknown.The analytical structure has been established as an important tool to identify the relationship between the system inputs and outputs [27,28]. On the other hand, the analytical structure information will make it possible to study the properties of the fuzzy control system and to show that the fuzzy control problem will be transformed into a nonlinear control problem. The mathematical relationship between inputs and outputs may assist the research community to understand the configurations of the fuzzy controllers. For the type-1 fuzzy logic controllers (T1-FLCs), the analytical structures of the T1F-PD controller [29] and the T1F-PI controller [30] have been performed and proved to be equivalent to nonlinear PD and PI controllers with variable gains. The analytical structure derivation depends on the configuration of the fuzzy controller, particularly, which kind of the fuzzy AND operator is used. There are many types of fuzzy AND operator; however, the Zadeh AND operator and the product AND operator are the only two operators that are employed in fuzzy control [31]. Deriving the input–output relationship of a fuzzy controller with the product AND operator is simple, but a fuzzy controller that performed using the other operator is far more difficult.Deriving the analytical structure of IT2-FLC is more complicated than its T1 counterpart as the IT2-FLC has more components, more parameters, and more complicated inference mechanism. An effort [31] has been made to drive the analytical structure of the IT2F-PI and the IT2F-PD controllers. The analytical structures in [31] have been used two different methods of defuzzification (centroid defuzzifier and average defuzzifier). Also, in [32] the analytical structure of the IT2F-PI and the IT2F-PD controllers has been performed using the Karnik–Mendel (KM) type-reduction method. Both [31,32] have been used singleton T1 output fuzzy sets, Zadeh AND operator and the KM algorithms to calculate the two endpoints of the type-reduced set which are computationally intensive. The high computational cost of the IT2-FLCs based on the KM algorithms may increase the computation time for the controller and hinder them from certain cost-sensitive real-world applications. Unlike [31,32], this paper proposes the analytical structure of the IT2F-PID controller, which is a parallel combination of the IT2F-PD and the IT2F-PI controllers using a new method of type-reduction called simplified type-reduction method. In this proposed type-reduction method the calculation of the two endpoints of type-reduced set depends on the average value between the two endpoints of the centroid for each rule's consequent IT2-FS. This proposal facilitates and reduces the complexity of calculating the type-reduced set. Moreover, the output of the two endpoints of the type-reduced set can be computed without the KM algorithms. Therefore, this method reduces the computational complexity and the computation time of a type-reduction for an IT2-FLC. In this paper, we use the interval T2 triangular fuzzy sets for the inputs and outputs of the IT2-FLC. In which, the well-known small gain theorem is employed to evaluate the BIBO stability condition of the IT2F-PID controller. The IT2F-PID controller using the proposed type-reduction method has been compared with the IT2F-PID controllers based on the other types of type-reduction methods. The simulation results show that the robustness of the IT2F-PID controller using the proposed type-reduction method to respond the system uncertainties.The main contributions of this study are summarized as: (1) Driving the analytical structure of the IT2F-PID controller using the new method of type-reduction. (2) Studying the stability analysis of the IT2F-PID controller, which consists of a parallel combination of the IT2F-PD controller and the IT2F-PI controller. (3) It is derived that the IT2F-PID controller has eight control parameters free to design. If all the control parameters are used, we really have more degree of freedom in designing the IT2F-PID controller to achieve multiple control targets such as robustness.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the structure of the IT2F-PID controller. Section 3 presents the analytical structure of the IT2F-PID controller. Section 4 presents the stability analysis of the IT2F-PID controller. Section 5 presents the simulation results followed by the conclusions and the relevant references.The overall structure of the IT2F-PID controller with a parallel structure is shown in Fig. 1. It uses two input variables, i.e., e(k) and v(k), and one output variable, i.e., uPID(k). For the IT2F-PD controller, two scaling factors Ge1 andGv1are employed to scale e(k) and v(k), respectively, as follows:(1)EPD(k)=Ge1e(k)=Ge1(r(k)−y(k))VPD(k)=Gv1v(k)=Gv1(e(k)−e(k−1))where r(k) is the reference signal, y(k) is the output of the system under control, and k is the sampling instance. The output variable uPD(k) of the IT2F-PD controller and its scaling factor Guare given by the following equation:(2)uPD(k)=GuUPD(k)Also, the two scaling factors Ge2 and Gv2 are employed to scale e(k) and v(k), respectively, for the IT2F-PI controller as follows:(3)EPI(k)=Ge2e(k)=Ge2(r(k)−y(k))VPI(k)=Gv2v(k)=Gv2(e(k)−e(k−1))The output variable of the IT2F-PI controller uPI(k) is obtained from the incremental output ΔuPI(k) and the previous output uPI(k−1) as follows:(4)uPI(k)=uPI(k−1)+ΔuPI(k)We introduce an internal variable ΔUPI(k) and its scaling factor GΔu; they relate to ΔuPI(k) through(5)ΔuPI(k)=GΔuΔUPI(k)The output of the IT2F-PID controller uPID(k) is obtained by the following equation:(6)uPID(k)=uPD(k)+uPI(k)The block diagram of the IT2F-PD controller and the IT2F-PI controller is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of four parts [33]: a fuzzifier, a rule base, an inference engine and an output processing which works as follows:The fuzzification process is the first operation of the IT2-FLC, which maps a crisp value into an IT2-FS. The E*(k) and V*(k) are fuzzified by two IT2-FSs, which are called “positive” and “negative” (see Fig. 3). The notation ∗(∗={PD, PI}) denotes the different types of IT2-FLC. These fuzzy sets can be considered as part of trapezoidal T2-FSs. The primary memberships for E*(k) and V*(k) are bounded by the upper and lower membership functions that are trapezoidal T1-FSs (E∗P1, E∗N1, V∗P1, V∗N1). The constants L1 and L2 which shown in Fig. 3 are design parameters. After shifting the membership functions upward and downward by the amount of θ1 for E∗P1 and E∗N1, as well as by the amount of θ2 for V∗P1 and V∗N1 along the vertical axes, where θ1, θ2∈[0, 0.5], we obtain the upper and lower membership functions of the T2-FSs (i.e., E*PU, E*PL, E*NU, E*NL, V*PU, V*PL, V*NUand V*NL). The definitions of the T2-FSs are as follows:(7)E*PU=(E*(k)+L1+P1)/2L1−L1−P1≤E*(k)≤L1−P11L1−P1≤E*(k)≤L1+P10otherwise(8)E*PL=(E*(k)+L1−P1)/2L1−L1+P1≤E*(k)≤L1+P10otherwise(9)E*NU=(L1+P1−E*(k))/2L1−L1+P1≤E*(k)≤L1+P11−L1−P1≤E*(k)≤−L1+P10otherwise(10)E*NL=(L1−P1−E*(k))/2L1−L1−P1≤E*(k)≤L1−P10otherwise(11)V*PU=(V*(k)+L2+P2)/2L2−L2−P2≤V*(k)≤L2−P21L2−P2≤V*(k)≤L2+P20otherwise(12)V*PL=(V*(k)+L2−P2)/2L2−L2+P2≤V*(k)≤L2+P20otherwise(13)V*NU=(L2+P2−V*(k))/2L2−L2+P2≤V*(k)≤L2+P21−L2−P2≤V*(k)≤−L2+P20otherwise(14)V*NL=(L2−P2−V*(k))/2L2−L2−P2≤V*(k)≤L2−P20otherwiseThe design parameters θ1 and θ2 are used to specify the different degree of uncertainties represented by the T2-FSs. In Fig. 3, P1=2L1θ1 and P2=2L2θ2. The secondary membership functions of these T2-FSs are all equal to 1 for the entire universe of discourse.Fig. 4shows the membership functions for the output of each IT2-FLC (UPD(k) for the IT2F-PD controller and ΔUPI(k) for the IT2F-PI controller) where the universe of discourse is divided into three overlapping interval triangular T2-FS values labeled N (Negative), Z (Zero) and P (Positive). As there are two fuzzy sets for E*(k) and two fuzzy sets for V*(k), there are only four simple fuzzy control rules used in each IT2-FLC.Rule based for the IT2F-PD controller:Rule 1: IF EPD(k) is positive AND VPD(k) is positive THEN UPD(k) is positive.Rule 2: IF EPD(k) is positive AND VPD(k) is negative THEN UPD(k) is zero.Rule 3: IF EPD(k) is negative AND VPD(k) is positive THEN UPD(k) is zero.Rule 4: IF EPD(k) is negative AND VPD(k) is negative THEN UPD(k) is negative.Rule based for the IT2F-PI controller:Rule 1: IF EPI(k) is positive AND VPI(k) is positive THEN ΔUPI(k) is positive.Rule 2: IF EPI(k) is positive AND VPI(k) is negative THEN ΔUPI(k) is zero.Rule 3: IF EPI(k) is negative AND VPI(k) is positive THEN ΔUPI(k) is zero.Rule 4: IF EPI(k) is negative AND VPI(k) is negative THEN ΔUPI(k) is negative.The basic function of the inference engine is to compute the overall value of the control output variable based on the individual contributions of each rule in the rule base [30]. Zadeh fuzzy logic AND operator (i.e., min()) is used to realize the AND operations in the rules. Using the interval T2 fuzzy inference, the firing intervals as a result of the Zadeh AND operation for Rule 1 to Rule 4 are(15)μ1=[μ1L,μ1U]=[min(E*PL,V*PL),min(E*PU,V*PU)]forUPD(k)=P,ΔUPI(k)=P(16)μ2=[μ2L,μ2U]=[min(E*PL,V*NL),min(E*PU,V*NU)]forUPD(k)=Z,ΔUPI(k)=Z(17)μ3=[μ3L,μ3U]=[min(E*NL,V*PL),min(E*NU,V*PU)]forUPD(k)=Z,ΔUPI(k)=Z(18)μ4=[μ4L,μ4U]=[min(E*NL,V*NL),min(E*NU,V*NU)]forUPD(k)=N,ΔUPI(k)=NIt may be noted that the control rules (Rule 2 and Rule 3) generate two memberships μ2 and μ3 which have the same output fuzzy set (Z). Using the Lukasiewicz logic T-conorms a combined membership is obtained as [30]:(19)μLL=min(1,μ2L+μ3L)=μ2L+μ3L≤1(20)μUL=min(1,μ2U+μ3U)=μ2U+μ3U≤1The IT2 fuzzy outputs of the inference engine are then processed by the type reducer, which combines the output sets and performs a centroid calculation that leads to T1-FSs called the type-reduced sets. There are several methods of type-reduction that used the KM procedure [34]. In this paper, we propose a new method of type-reduction called simplified type-reduction method. This method reduces the computational cost of type-reduction for the IT2-FLC. After the type reduction process, the type-reduced sets are defuzzified (by taking the average of the type-reduced set) to obtain crisp outputs that are sent to the actuators.The calculation steps of the proposed simplified type-reduction method are performed as follows:A.Compute the centroid of each rule's consequent IT2-FS using the KM algorithms [37]. Call it [CNL,CNR] for fuzzy set N, [CZL,CZR] for fuzzy set Z and [CPL,CPR] for fuzzy set P.Compute the firing interval for each fired rule as described above in Eqs. (15)–(20).Compute the left endpoint yLand the right endpoint yRas follows [35,36]:(21)yL=μ1LCN+μLLCZ+μ4LCPμ1L+μLL+μ4L,yR=μ1UCN+μULCZ+μ4UCPμ1U+μUL+μ4Uwhere CN=(CNL+CNR)/2, CZ=(CZL+CZR)/2 and CP=(CPL+CPR)/2. Assume CZ=0Compute approximate defuzzified output:The two endpoints for the type-reduced set can be computed without KM algorithms and it is as a combination of the outputs of two T1-FLSs: one constructed only from the lower membership functions and the other constructed only from the upper membership functions. Also, the proposed method is a closed form type-reduction and reduces the computation complexity.The main concept that is used to determine the mathematical relationship between the inputs and outputs in an IT2-FLC is to determine the outcomes of the min() operations in the four rules [31]. The nature of this issue is the same as when deriving the analytical structure of the T1-FLCs whose fuzzy rules involve the Zadeh AND operator [29,30]. We consider the case, when E*(k) is inside [−L1−P1, L1+P1], and V*(k) is inside [−L2−P2, L2+P2] for brevity. The structure expressions for the remaining cases can be derived similarly.To derive the structure expressions of Eqs. (21) and (22), we first need to determine the final membership value for each of the rules in Eqs. (15)–(18). In each of the min() expressions, the membership values of the input variables (i.e., E*(k) and V*(k)) are variables. Therefore, to find which membership value is smaller, we need to divide the input space [−L1−P1, L1+P1]×[−L2−P2, L2+P2] into a number of regions, each of which is called input combination (IC) so that for each region, the inequality relationship between the two input variables is exclusive. Figs. 5–8show the input space division results for Rule 1 to Rule 4.Fig. 5(a) shows an example for the region divisions of Rule 1 for μ1U=min(E*PU, V*PU). When E*(k) and V*(k) are in the IC1, then E*PU=V*PU=1. So, μ1U=1, which is marked in the IC in the figure. In IC2, E*PU<V*PU; so, μ1U=E*PU. Finally, in IC3, E*PU>V*PU; hence, μ1U=V*PU. These figures are only considered what happens to the min () operations when each rule is evaluated one by one. Though, all the four rules are actually executed at the same time. Consequently, they should be considered simultaneously. This amounts to superimpose all these figures. The numbers and shapes of the final region divisions after the superimposing depend on the shapes of the input fuzzy sets. For example, we assume L1>L2 and L1×θ1=L2×θ2 (i.e., P1=P2), superimposing results in a total 25 ICs, as shown in Fig. 9. The results of the upper and the lower limits of the firing intervals in Eqs. (15)–(18) for these 25 ICs are listed in Table 1.For each IC, putting the eight membership functions corresponding to the IC into Eq. (21) and then, send the results to Eq. (22). After some mathematical manipulations, we will obtain the analytical structure of the IT2-FLC for that IC.Tables 2 and 3show the mathematical expressions of yLand yRfor all the ICs that shown in Fig. 9, for the IT2F-PD controller. Note that the 25 expressions share the same structure pattern(23)yL=yR=C1Ge1e(k)+C2Gv1v(k)+C3D1Ge1e(k)+D2Gv1v(k)+D3where Cnand Dn, for n=1, 2, 3 are constants whose values depend on the design parameters of fuzzy controller (e.g., L1, L2, θ1, θ2, CNand CP). Keeping Eq. (22) in mind, we have(24)uPD(k)=12∑j=12GuC1jGe1e(k)+C2jGv1v(k)+C3jD1jGe1e(k)+D2jGv1v(k)+D3jLettingKp1(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GuGe1C1jD1jGe1e(k)+D2jGv1v(k)+D3jKd(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GuGv1C2jD1jGe1e(k)+D2jGv1v(k)+D3jδ1(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GuC3jD1jGe1e(k)+D2jGv1v(k)+D3jThen(25)uPD(k)=Kp1(e(k),v(k)).e(k)+Kd(e(k),v(k)).v(k)+δ(e(k),v(k))which can be viewed as a nonlinear PD controller in a position form with the variable proportional gainKp1(e(k),v(k)), the variable derivative gainKd(e(k),v(k))and the variable control offsetδ1(e(k),v(k)).As an example, the proportional gain and the derivative gain for the IC1 that shown in Fig. 9 using Table 2 are given by Eqs. (26) and (27).(26)Kp1(e(k),v(k))=−L2CNGuGe1−2L2Ge1e(k)+4L1L2(1−θ1−θ2)−L2CNGuGe1−2L2Ge1e(k)+4L1L2(1+θ1+θ2)(27)Kd(e(k),v(k))=L1CPGuGv1−2L2Ge1e(k)+4L1L2(1−θ1−θ2)−L1CPGuGv1−2L2Ge1e(k)+4L1L2(1+θ1+θ2)The mathematical expressions of yLand yRfor all ICs that shown in Fig. 9 for the IT2F-PI controller is the same as in the IT2F-PD controller where the scaling factors Ge2 and Gv2 are instead of Ge1 and Gv1. Keeping Eq. (22) in mind, we have(28)ΔuPI(k)=12∑j=12GΔuC1jGe2e(k)+C2jGv2v(k)+C3jD1jGe2e(k)+D2jGv2v(k)+D3jLettingKp2(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GΔuGv2C2jD1jGe2e(k)+D2jGv2v(k)+D3jKi(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GΔuGe2C1jD1jGe2e(k)+D2jGv2v(k)+D3jδ2(e(k),v(k))=12∑j=12GΔuC3jD1jGe2e(k)+D2jGv2v(k)+D3jThen(29)ΔuPI(k)=Kp2(e(k),v(k)).v(k)+Ki(e(k),v(k)).e(k)+δ2(e(k),v(k))which Eq. (29) can be viewed as a nonlinear PI controller in an incremental form with the variable proportional gainKp2(e(k),v(k)), the variable integral gainKi(e(k),v(k))and the variable control offsetδ2(e(k),v(k)).Remark 1The IT2F-PD (or corresponding PI) controller using the proposed type-reduction method (simplified type-reduction method) is equivalent to a nonlinear PD (or PI) controller with variable gains and control offset.In this section, we drive the analytical structure of the IT2F-PID controller, which consists of the parallel structure of the IT2F-PD controller and the IT2F-PI controller as shown above in Fig. 1. From Eqs. (4), (6), (25) and (29) the overall IT2F-PID controller output will be(30)uPID(k)=(Kp1+Ki)e(k)+(Kd+Kp2)v(k)+δ1+δ2+uPI(k−1)The change of the control output is given by(31)ΔuPID(k)=uPID(k)−uPID(k−1)From Eqs. (30) and (31), the overall change of the control output can be approximated as:(32)Δu(k)PID≈(Kp1+Ki+Kd+Kp2)e(k)+(−2Kd−2Kp2−Kp1−Ki)e(k−1)+(Kd+Kp2)e(k−2)+δLettingK1=Kp1+Ki+Kd+KP2, K2=−2Kd−2Kp2−Kp1−Kiand K3=Kd+KP2Then(33)ΔuPID(k)=K1e(k)+K2e(k−1)+K3(k−2)+δNote that the linear PID controller in a discrete form is(34)ΔuPIDd(k)=uPIDd(k)−uPIDd(k−1)=K1de(k)+K2de(k−1)+K3d(k−2)whereK1d,K2dandK3dare the gains of the digital PID controller. Comparing Eq. (33) with the above formula we can conclude that the IT2F-PID controller with a parallel structure is a nonlinear PID controller with the variable gains (K1, K2 and K3) and the variable control offset δ.Remark 2The parallel structure of the IT2F-PID controller that shown in Fig. 1 using the proposed type-reduction is a nonlinear and the inherent relationship between its components and their functioning can be transparent to the designer. As shown in Eqs. (25), (29) and (33), the IT2F-PID is a nonlinear PID type controller because its structure is the same as the discrete form of the linear PID controller. The controller gains are composed of the IT2F-PID parameters Ge1,Gv1,Ge2,Gv2,Guand GΔu.The IT2F-PID controller has the eight control parameters free to design (Ge1,Gv1,Ge2,Gv2,Gu, GΔu, θ1, and θ2), whereas the conventional PID only has three. If all the control parameters are used, we really have more degree of freedom in designing the IT2F-PID controller to achieve multiple control targets such as robustness.In this section, the sufficient conditions of BIBO stability are derived for the IT2F-PID controller using the we1l-known small gain theorem [38]. Consider the system shown in Fig. 10. Let the subsystems H1 and H2 represent the IT2F-PID controller and the plant under control, respectively. The overall feedback system is described by the equations:e1=u1−y2, e2=u2+y1, y1=H1e1, andy2=H2e2Let γ1=γ(H1), the gain of H1 and γ2=γ(H2), the gain of H2. Assume that there are constants β1, β2, γ1≥0 and γ2≥0 so that(35)||y1||=||H1e1||≤γ1||e1||+β1(36)||y2||=||H2e2||≤γ2||e2||+β2Under these conditions, the system is BIBO stable if γ1γ2<1 according to the small gain theorem, i.e., any bounded input pair (u1, u2) produces a bounded output pair (y1, y2).We consider the general case where the plant under control is a nonlinear, denoted by N. By defining r(k)=u1(k), e(k)=e1(k), ΔuPID(k)=y1(k), uPID(k−1)=u2(k), uPID(k)=e2(k) and y(k)=y2(k) in Fig. 1, we obtain the equivalent closed loop system in Fig. 10.For an easier and more insightful analysis, let us assume, the parameters of the IT2F-PID controller set as:L1=L2=L, θ1=θ2=θ, L1=L2=L, Cp=R, CN=−Rwhere R>0. These assumptions are not restrictive as the stability analysis is applicable to any other parameter value settings. Note that when L1=L2, we have 16 ICs instead of 25 ICs that shown in Fig. 11. The corresponding upper and lower limits of the intervals are the same as those of the first 16 of the 25 ICs that shown in Table 1. Our derivation of sufficient conditions of BIBO stability will focus on the IT2F-PID controller in IC1 to IC4 only. This is the most important region for the controller operation because (1) it contains the system's equilibrium point(e(k),v(k))=(0,0)and (2) when the controller operates outside of these ICs, at least one of the two input variables is fuzzified by the flat portions of the T2-FSs. The controller parameters for the IT2F-PD and the IT2F-PI controllers in IC1 to IC4 are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.Observe that when the controller is in the regions IC1 and IC3 and from Eq. (33) we have(37)||ΔuPID(k)||=||y1(k)||=||H1e1(k)||≤K1|e1(k)|+(K2+K3)Me+δwhere Meis the maximum magnitude of the error signal which is defined as:(38)Me≔supk≥0|e(k)|Eq. (37) is in the form of Eq. (35) with γ1=K1. Next we have(39)||y(k)||=||y2(k)||=||H2e2(k)||=||Ne2(k)||≤||N|||e2(k)|Eq. (39) is in the form of Eq. (36) with γ2=||N||<∞. So, the sufficient condition for the nonlinear IT2F-PID control system to be BIBO stable is the parameters of the IT2F-PID controller must satisfy the inequality K1|N|<1. Where K1 is defined as:K1=LRGe1Gu2LGe1Me+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGe1Gu2LGe1Me+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGv1Gu2LGe1Me+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGv1Gu2LGe1Me+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGv2GΔu2LGe2Me+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGv2GΔu2LGe2Me+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGe2GΔu2LGe2Me+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGe2GΔu2LGe2Me+4L2(1+2θ)where Meis defined in Eq. (38).When the controller is in the regions IC2 and IC4, we can similarly obtain a sufficient stability condition K1||N||<1 where K1 is defined as:K1=LRGe1Gu2LGv1Mv+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGe1Gu2LGv1Mv+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGv1Gu2LGv1Mv+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGv1Gu2LGv1Mv+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGv2GΔu2LGv2Mv+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGv2GΔu2LGv2Mv+4L2(1+2θ)+LRGe2GΔu2LGv2Mv+4L2(1−2θ)+LRGe2GΔu2LGv2Mv+4L2(1+2θ)where Mvis defined as:Mv≔supk≥0|v(k)|=supk≥0|e(k)−e(k−1)|By combining all the above conditions together, we arrive the sufficient condition of the BIBO stability for the IT2F-PID controller.To show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed IT2F-PID controller using the new type-reduction method, it is applied to an uncertain nonlinear system. A coupled-tank system [39] is shown in Fig. 12. The system consists of two small tower-type tanks mounted above a reservoir that stores the water. Two independent pumps, pump water into the top of each tank, and two capacitive-type probe sensors measure the levels of water. Each tank is fitted with an outlet at the side near the base. Raising the baffle between the two tanks allows water flow between them. The amount of water which returns to the reservoir is approximately proportional to the square root of the height of water in the tank, which is a main source of the nonlinearity.The dynamics of the coupled-tank system can be modeled by the following differential equations [39]:(40)A1dH1dt=Q1−(α1+Δα1)(H1+ΔH1−(α3+Δα3)(H1+ΔH1)−(H2+ΔH2)(41)A2dH2dt=Q2−(α2+Δα2)(H2+ΔH2+(α3+Δα3)(H1+ΔH1)−(H2+ΔH2)where A1, A2 are the cross-sectional area of tank Nos. 1, 2; H1, H2 are the water level in tank Nos. 1, 2; Q1, Q2 are the volumetric flow rate (cm3/s) of pump Nos. 1, 2; α1, α2, α3 are the proportionality constant corresponding to theH1,H2, andH1−H2terms; ΔH1, ΔH2 are the uncertainty values due to the measurement error of the water levels; Δα1, Δα2, Δα3 are the uncertainty values in the parameters α1, α2, α3.The coupled-tank system can be configured as a second-order SISO system by turning off pump No. 2 and using pump No. 1 to control the water level in tank No. 2. Since pump No. 2 is turned off, Q2 equals zero and Eq. (41) reduces to(42)A2dH2dt=−(α2+Δα2)(H2+ΔH2+(α3+Δα3)(H1+ΔH1)−(H2+ΔH2)The sampling period used to produce the results in this paper is 1s. It is assumed that the nominal plant has the following process parameters; A1=A2=36.5cm2, α1=α2=5.6186 and α3=10. The membership functions for the inputs of the IT2F-PID controller (the error signal and the derivative of the error signal) are shown in Fig. 3, where the membership parameters are L1=L2=1, θ1=θ2=0.25 and P=0.5. The membership functions for the outputs of the IT2F-PD controller and the IT2F-PI controller are shown in Fig. 4. The inputs and outputs scaling factors that are shown in Fig. 1, are chosen based on the physical values of the system as Ge1=Ge2=0.07,Gv1=1,Gv2=2, Gu=70 and GΔu=20. In order to clarify the improvements of the IT2F-PID controller using the proposed method of type-reduction, the simulation results with the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method [31] and the KM algorithms [32] using the same number of membership functions, a number of rules, the same universe of discourse and the gains that shown in Fig. 1, are also presented.Three performance indices are employed as quantitative measures for comparing the three IT2F-PID controllers; the mean absolute errors (MAE), the integral of absolute errors (IAE) and the root mean square errors (RMSE) criteria which are defined as:(43)MAE=1kf∑k=1kf|e(k)|(44)IAE=∫0∞|e(t)|dt(45)RMSE=1kf∑k=1kf(e(k))2where e(t) is the error signal and kfis the number of iterations. Three simulation tasks are presented as follows:Fig. 13shows the response of the coupled-tank system where the set-point is equal 10cm. It is clear that the response of the system tracks the set-point without an overshoot and without a steady state error for the IT2F-PID controllers based on the proposed type-reduction method, the average method and the KM method. Fig. 14shows the MAE that defined in Eq. (43) which indicates that the MAE for the IT2F-PID controller using the proposed type-reduction method is a lower than those obtained for the IT2F-PID controllers using the average method and the KM method.This task shows the effect of adding uncertainty in the parameters α1, α2, α3. Fig. 15shows the response of the coupled-tank system when adding Δα1=10, Δα2=10, Δα3=−6 after 300s from starting the simulation. The IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method can realize tracking of a water level with a smaller overshoot and a smaller settling time after adding the uncertainty value rather than the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method and the KM method. Fig. 16shows that the MAE for the IT2F-PID controller using the proposed type-reduction method is a lower than those obtained for the IT2F-PID controllers using the average method and the KM method.This task shows the effect of the uncertainty due to the measurement error in the level of the water in tank Nos. 1, 2. The response of the coupled-tank system for this task using ΔH1=0.1cm and ΔH1=1cm after 300s from starting the simulation is shown in Fig. 17. It is clear that, the response of the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method after adding the uncertainty value is a better than the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method and the KM method. Also, Fig. 18indicates the MAE for the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method is a lower those obtained for the IT2F-PID controllers based on the other methods.This task shows the effect of the uncertainty in the parameters α1, α2, α3 and the uncertainty due to the measurement error in the level of the water in tank Nos. 1, 2. The response of the coupled-tank system for this task using Δα1=10, Δα2=10, Δα3=−6, ΔH1=0.1cm and ΔH1=1cm after 300s from starting the simulation is shown in Fig. 19. It is clear that, the response of the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method has an overshoot and a settling time smaller than other controllers. The MAE that is shown in Fig. 20, for the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method is a lower than other controllers.Tables 6 and 7list the IAE and the RMSE values, respectively, for the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method and the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method and the KM method for all the above simulation tasks. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the values of the IAE, and the ISE, which are obtained from the IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method are a lower than those obtained for the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method and the KM method. Table 8lists the computation time for the proposed type-reduction, the average method and the KM method. It is clear that the proposed type-reduction method reduces the computation time required for the output processing of the IT2F-PID controller.Remark 4The IT2F-PID controller based on the proposed type-reduction method is superior to respond the uncertainty in the parameters α1, α2, α3 and the uncertainty due to the measurement error of the water levels rather than the IT2F-PID controllers based on the average method, the KM method and the UB method. Also, the proposed type-reduction method reduces the computation time for the output processing for the IT2F-PID controller.
