@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Most of the traditional histogram-based thresholding techniques are effective for bi-level thresholding and unable to consider spatial contextual information of the image for selecting optimal threshold. In this article a novel thresholding technique is presented by proposing an energy function to generate the energy curve of an image by taking into an account the spatial contextual information of the image. The behavior of this energy curve is very much similar to the histogram of the image. To incorporate spatial contextual information of the image for threshold selection process, this energy curve is used as an input of our technique instead of histogram. Moreover, to mitigate multilevel thresholding problem the properties of genetic algorithm are exploited. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the number of different types of images using a validity measure. The results of the proposed technique are compared with those obtained by using histogram of the image and also with an existing genetic algorithm based context sensitive technique. The comparisons confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image segmentation plays an important role in image analysis and computer vision. It is often used to partition an image into separate regions, which ideally correspond to different real-world objects. Thresholding is one of the most important and effective method for image segmentation. Due to the advantage of smaller storage space, fast processing speed and ease in manipulation, thresholding techniques have drawn a lot of attention during the last couple of decades. Since thresholding is a well-researched field, there exist many algorithms for determining an optimal threshold of the image. A survey of thresholding methods and their applications exist in literature [1].Thresholding techniques can be divided into bi-level and multilevel category, depending on the number of thresholds required to be detected. In bi-level thresholding, an image is segmented into two different regions depending on a threshold value selected from the histogram of the image [2–10]. The pixels with gray values greater than the threshold value are assigned into object region, and the rest are assigned into background. Multilevel thresholding segments a gray level image into several distinct regions by detecting more than one thresholds [11–13]. Otsu's method [2] is one of the popular histogram thresholding method that chooses an optimal threshold by maximizing the between class variance. The minimum error thresholding methods [3,4] defined a criterion based on the assumption that the object and background pixels are normally distributed and the optimum threshold is achieved by optimizing a criterion function related to the Bayes risk. In Pun's method [5], as modified by Kapur et al. [6], the threshold is determined by maximizing the entropy of the object and background pixels. Kwon's [7] proposed a threshold selection method based on the cluster analysis. In [8] a thresholding criterion is formulated by exploring the knowledge about intensity contrast. Huang and Wang [9] introduced fuzzy entropy measure to select optimum threshold from the histogram. In [10], Liu et al. proposed a thresholding technique that selects an optimal threshold based on a fuzzy entropy measure which considers both inter class distinctness and intra class variation.Traditional thresholding techniques based on histogram of the image suffered two major limitations [2,3,6,9]: (i) Unable to consider contextual information for selecting optimum threshold. (ii) Inefficient for multilevel thresholding as computationally demanding and complicated to implement. To mitigate the first limitation, an energy function is proposed. This energy function computes the energy of an image at each gray value by taking into an account the spatial contextual information of the image. The characteristics of this energy curve is similar to the histogram of an image i.e., if the energy curve of an image includes peaks, we can separate it into a number of modes. Each mode is expected to correspond to a region, and there exists a threshold at the valley between any two adjacent modes [14]. Thus, with the help of proposed energy curve instead of histogram of the image, we incorporated spatial contextual information in the threshold selection process. To mitigate the second limitation, we exploited the properties of genetic algorithm (GA) [15–17]. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is modeled by extending the criterion proposed in [6]. In order to show the validity of the proposed approach four different images are used and results are compared with those obtained by using histogram of the image and also with an existing GA-based context sensitive technique [16].The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The proposed technique is presented in Section “Proposed method”. Section “Experimental results” provides the detailed description of the experimental settings and the results obtained on the considered images. Finally, Section “Discussion and conclusion” draws the conclusion of this work.
