@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Pathway-based analysis approaches provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Copy number variations (CNVs) play an important role in gene expression regulation. Joint pathway analysis of CNVs and gene expression data should provide more useful information for revealing the molecular mechanism of complex diseases. To implement trans-omics pathway analysis of genome-wide CNVs and mRNA expression profiles data, we extended the gene set enrichment analysis algorithm and developed a flexible trans-omics pathway analysis tool CPAS. CPAS was developed by C to interface with R for efficient data analysis. CNV-gene and pathway-gene annotation files derived from public database were included in CPAS. We hope that CPAS could help to identify disease-relevant biological pathways that were undetectable using traditional single-omic analysis approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Copy number variations (CNVs) are common genomic variability in human genome [1]. Through altering gene dosage or genome organization, CNVs were suggested to explain more than 20% of gene expression variations [2]. Using genome-wide association studies of CNVs (GASC), a group of susceptibility loci has been identified for complex diseases [3,4]. However, GASC generally focus on the CNVs with the most significant association signals. Due to multiple testing problems, the susceptibility loci with moderate and weak phenotypic effects are difficult to be detected using GASC. The susceptibility loci identified by GASC are limited and mostly functionally independent. Because individual gene can participate in multiple cellular processes, identifying a couple of genes affecting disease risks is often inadequate for revealing the pathogenesis of complex diseases.Gene mRNA expression profile analysis is a useful tool for pathogenetic studies of complex diseases. To overcome the limitations of traditional single gene expression analysis, Subramanian et al., proposed gene set-based expression profile analysis and developed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software [5,6]. Because of integrating the mRNA expression levels and prior information of biological functions of multiple genes, GSEA is able to identify disease relevant biological pathways that are undetectable for single gene expression analysis [5]. Inspired by RNA-level GSEA, Wang et al., proposed genome-wide pathway-based association studies (PAS) using DNA-level SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data [7], which were successfully applied in the pathogenetic studies of complex diseases [8,9].Recently, trans-omics analysis of biological data becomes more and more popular in pathogenetic studies [10,11]. Because of integrating the information of multiple levels biological data (for example DNA-level and RNA-level data), trans-omics analysis can provide more useful information for pathogenetic studies. For example, Smith et al. successfully integratedDNA-methylation data into the mRNA expression analysis of glioblastoma, illustrating the performance of trans-omics mRNA expression analysis [11]. As common genetic polymorphism markers, CNVs can also be used for PAS. Given the important role of CNVs in gene expression regulation, trans-omics joint pathway analysis of CNVs and mRNA expression profile data should provide more pathogenetic information. However, the GSEA software was developed for gene expression profile data and cannot analyze CNVs data. The GSEA-SNP, SRT and SSEA tools were developed for pathway analysis of SNP data, and were not able to be directly used for trans-omics joint pathway analysis of CNVs and mRNA expression profile data.In this study, we extended the GSEA algorithm and developed a trans-omics pathway analysis tool, which was named CPAS. CPAS is capable of identifying disease relevant biological pathways through joint pathway analysis of genome-wide CNVs and mRNA expression profile data.CPAS is based on the enrichment statistical algorithm of GSEA [5,6]. To implement trans-omics pathway analysis of genome-wide CNVs and mRNA expression profile data, we modified GSEA algorithm. For a given pathway P, letEScPandESmPdenote the enrichment scores (ES) of CNVs and gene expression profile data of pathway P, respectively.EScPandESmPare first calculated by weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov-like running sum statistic using the statistical analysis results of CNVs and gene expression profile data [7]. Permutations are then conducted to obtain the null distributions ofEScPandESmP, through randomly shuffling the gene labels of CNVs and gene expression profile data. Normalized enrichment score (NES) of observed CNVs and gene expression profile data are calculated asNESobP=EScP-mean(EScnullP)SD(EScnullP)wc+ESmP-mean(ESmnullP)SD(ESmnullP)(1.0-wc)where wcis the weight parameter of CNVs data. By default, equal weights(wc=0.5)are given to CNVs and gene expression data in CPAS.EScnullPandESmnullPdenote the null distributions ofEScPandESmP, and are calculated from the permutated CNVs and gene expression profile data. Following Wang et al.’ approach [7], statistical P value and false discovery rate are calculated from the permutation. Detailed analysis algorithm and procedures can be find in the document of CPAS (Fig. 1).We developed a program CPAS to implement the approach proposed by this study. CNV-gene and pathway-gene annotation information files are included in CPAS tool. CNV-gene annotation file contains 176,058 entries, which are derived from the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home). Two pathway-gene catalog information files are available in CPAS tool. The first one contains 3272 pathways or gene ontology categories, which are derived from the Molecular Signatures Database of GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). The second one contains 963 pathways, which are collected from four public pathway annotation database, including KEGG (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html), BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/genes), Ambion GeneAssist Pathway Atlas (http://www.ambion.com/tools/pathway) and Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org). Users’ annotation files are also acceptable in CPAS tool. CPAS was developed by C to interface with R (http://www.r-project.org/) for efficient data analysis. CPAS program, documents and illustrative examples are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ cpasv1/files/.Two real gene expression profile datasets of Kashin–Beck disease (KBD) were used to illustrate the application of CPAS [12]. In the first dataset, articular cartilage specimens were collected from 5 KBD patients and 5 healthy subjects, matched for age and sex. Genetic cartilage diseases, primary osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis were excluded by cartilage section examination with H&E staining. Total RNA was isolated from cartilage specimens. Microarray hybridization was performed using Agilent Human 1A 22k Whole Genome microarray (containing 21,073 human genes). GSEA was used to conduct pathway expression analysis of KBD microarray data. We found that REACTOME_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY_FOR_APOPTOSIS (P value<10−3) pathway was significantly abnormally expressed in KBD articular cartilage [12]. Within REACTOME_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY_ FOR_APOPTOSIS pathway, 6 genes showed significant expression difference (ratios<0.5 or ratios>2.0) between KBD articular cartilage and healthy articular cartilage [12]. Without loss of generality, the CNVs association testing statistics of the 6 differently expressed genes were randomly generated with P values<0.05 using the “runif” function of R (http://www.r-project.org/). The CNVs association testing statistics of remaining genes in microarray were randomly generated with P values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Among the 3272 pathways or gene ontology categories analyzed by this study, CPAS detected the most significant association between KBD and REACTOME_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY_FOR_APOPTOSIS (FDR=0.003) (Fig. 2A). Excessive chondrocyte apoptosis is one of the primary cartilage damage of KBD [13–15]. Wang et al. found that the percentage of apoptotic chondrocytes (33.60%) in KBD articular cartilage was much bigger than that (1.33%) in healthy articular cartilage [15]. Dysfunction of apoptosis related REACTOME_INTRINSIC_PATHWAY_FOR_APOPTOSIS pathway may contribute to the articular cartilage damage of KBD.In the second dataset, total RNA was isolated from isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 KBD patients and 12 healthy controls. Microarray hybridization was performed using Agilent Human 1A 22k Whole Genome microarray. GSEA was applied for pathway expression analysis. We found that REACTOME_MAPK_TARGETS_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_MEDIATED_BY_MAP_KINASES (P value<10−3) pathway was significantly abnormally expressed in KBD peripheral blood mononuclear cells [12]. Without loss of generality, the CNVs association testing statistics of 3 differently expressed genes in the REACTOME_MAPK_TARGETS_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_MEDIATED_BY_MAP_KINASES pathway were randomly generated with P values<0.05 using the “runif” function of R (http://www.r-project.org/). The CNVs association testing statistics of remaining genes in microarray were randomly generated with P values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Among the 3272 pathways or gene ontology categories analyzed by this study, CPAS detected the most significant association between KBD and REACTOME_MAPK_TARGETS_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_ MEDIATED_BY_MAP_KINASES (FDR=0.017) (Fig. 2B). The REACTOME_MAPK_TARGETS_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_MEDIATED_BY_MAP_KINASES pathway consists of genes involved in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)-medicated biological process, such as cell differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation. It has been demonstrated that MAPK played an important role in the regulation of chondrogenesis and cartilage development [16]. Dysfunction of MAPK contributed to cartilage-related diseases, such as osteoarthritis [16]. REACTOME_MAPK_TARGETS_NUCLEAR_EVENTS_MEDIATED_BY_MAP_KINASES pathway may also involve in the development of KBD.
