@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The internal estimates of Loss Given Default (LGD) must reflect economic downturn conditions, thus estimating the “downturn LGD”, as the new Basel Capital Accord Basel II establishes. We suggest a methodology to estimate the downturn LGD distribution to overcome the arbitrariness of the methods suggested by Basel II. We assume that LGD is a mixture of an expansion and recession distribution. In this work, we propose an accurate parametric model for LGD and we estimate its parameters by the EM algorithm. Finally, we apply the proposed model to empirical data on Italian bank loans.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Loss Given Default (LGD) is the loss incurred by a financial institution when an obligor defaults on a loan, given as the fraction of Exposure At Default (EAD) unpaid after some period of time. In the Basel II framework (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2004, paragraph 286–317), banks adopting the advanced Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach are allowed to use their own estimates of LGDs that have to reflect economic downturn conditions. Hence, the “downturn LGD” is the maximum of the long-run default-weighted average LGD and the stressed LGD.It requires the banks to identify the appropriate downturn conditions and incorporate them so as to produce LGD parameters for the bank’s exposures, which are consistent with the identified downturn conditions. The main reason for this requirement is that the Vasicek model (Vasicek, 2002) used in Basel II does not have systematic correlation between Probability of Default (PD) and LGD and, to compensate for this deficiency, downturn LGD are required to be used as input to the model.Although the downturn LGD is a key variable for banking practice, such a pivotal topic is relatively unexplored in the literature. The main aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to estimate the downturn LGD distribution. To achieve this aim, we consider the dynamic behaviour of LGD over the economic cycle characterised by two regimes: expansion and recession.We assume that the LGD is a mixture of an expansion and a recession distributions, each of these distributions is given by the mixture of a Bernoulli random variable and a beta random variable, as Calabrese (in press) suggested. On the one hand, the Bernoulli random variable allows to reproduce the high concentration of data at total recovery and total loss (Calabrese & Zenga, 2010; Renault & Scaillet, 2004; Schuermann, 2003). On the other hand, the beta distribution is well suited1Since LGD lies in the interval [0,1], the beta distribution is a suitable parametric model for LGDs since it has support [0,1] and, in spite of requiring only two parameters, is quite flexible.1to the modelling of LGDs (Bruche & González-Aguado, 2008; Gupton, Finger, & Bhatia, 1997; Gupton & Stein, 2002). To estimate the parameters of the downturn LGD distribution, we apply the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977). To obtain a finite beta density function, Calabrese and Zenga (2010)’s parametrization is used. With this method banks do not need to identify arbitrarily downturn conditions and, unlike the factor method, data on the default risk and default correlation are not required. Finally, we apply this proposal to a comprehensive Bank of Italy data set (Bank of Italy, 2001) of 149,378 Italian bank loans and we compare it with some methods used in the literature to estimate the downturn LGD.The present paper is organised as follows. The next section analyses the available literature on downturn LGD. Section 3 describes some approaches to estimate downturn LGD. The following section presents the proposed approach to estimate the downturn LGD distribution. Section 5 describes the dataset of the Bank of Italy and shows the estimation results by applying the proposed model to these data. Finally, the last section is devoted to conclusions.
