@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Covering rough sets are a generalization of Pawlak rough sets, in which a partition of the universal set induced by an equivalence relation is replaced by a covering. In this paper, covering rough sets are transformed into generalized rough sets induced by binary relations. The paper discusses three theoretical topics. First, we consider a special type of covering in which the neighborhoods form a reduction of the covering, and we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for neighborhoods in a covering form a reduction of the covering. Second, we study another special type of covering, and give conditions for the covering lower and upper approximations to be dual to each other. Finally, we give an axiomatic system that characterizes the lower and upper approximations of rough sets based on a partial order.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak [14,15] in 1982, is a useful tool for dealing with vagueness and granularity in information systems. Pawlak rough set theory is built on equivalence relations. However, equivalence relations impose restrictions and limitations in many applications [3,5,7,8,13,24,26]. Thus, one of the main directions of research in rough set theory is the generalization of rough approximations. Many extensions have been made to the theory by replacing equivalence relations with notions such as arbitrary binary relations [19,21,26], fuzzy relations [11], and coverings [16,20,23,30,33] of the universal sets. Zakowski [29] first extended Pawlak rough sets by using coverings of the domain rather than partitions.Many types of covering rough set model have been proposed and investigated since Zakowski [29] extended Pawlak rough sets; see, for example, [4,31,33]. Bonikowski et al. [1] formulated conditions for the existence of operations on covering rough sets. Diker and Ugur [4] introduce relations between coverings and dicoverings within the framework of rough sets. In [17], Restrepo et al. investigated properties of approximation operators, and proved a characterization for pairs of approximation operators that are both dual and adjoint. In [18], they continued their study of covering approximation operators, and organized covering rough sets into 6 dual pairs. More recently, Yun et al. [28] characterized the conditions for a neighborhood{N(x)|x∈U}to form a partition of the universal set U. The problem of reduction arises in many practical applications and is an important area of research in database and information systems [9]. A useful method for reduction of information systems is the rough set theory approach that depends on partitioning the universal set of objects using equivalence relations. As we know, reduction is also a significant topic in covering rough sets. The concept of reduction in coverings was introduced by Zhu and Wang [32], who moreover gave a procedure for finding a reduction for a covering. In contrast with the conditions from [28] for a neighborhood{N(x)|x∈U}to form a partition of universal set U, a neighborhood{N(x)|x∈U}is not in general a reduction of a covering. A natural question to ask is whether we can characterize the conditions under which{N(x)|x∈U}forms a reduction of C. This is clearly an interesting mathematical question, and in this paper we answer it affirmatively. In addition, neighborhoods are also an important concept in topology. The answer to this question provides more insight into the topological structure of covering rough sets. We hope that the results in this paper can be used to select useful features and eliminate superfluous attributes in covering information systems.The motivation of the paper is the question above. In this paper we only consider one type of covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. Our purpose is three theoretical topics. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which{N(x)|x∈U}is the reduction of a covering of U. Second, we consider conditions under whichC̲andC‾are dual to each other. Finally, we study axiomatic approaches to rough sets, which are important for understanding their mathematical structure and may help with developing methods for real applications. There has been much effort made in researching axiomatic approaches [11,22,25]. However, up until now, rough sets based on a partial order have not been axiomatized. Partial orders are an important type of relation. We give an axiomatic system for rough sets induced by a partial order in this paper.Throughout the paper there is no requirement for the universal set to be finite. That is, we work over a fixed universal set U, where unless otherwise stated the cardinality of U is infinite.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review standard definitions of rough sets, covering rough sets, and reductions of coverings. In Section 3, we study interesting properties of neighborhoods{N(x)|x∈U}and the approximationsN̲andN‾induced by a covering C of U. We also obtain conditions for neighborhoods in a covering to form a reduction. In Section 4, we consider conditions under whichC‾andC̲are dual to each other. In Section 5, we investigate the properties of posets, and give an axiomatic system for rough sets based on a partial order. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6.This section reviews briefly the fundamental notation and notions based on generalized rough sets, covering rough sets, and neighborhoods. We refer to [11,32,33] for details.Although there are many different types of generalized rough sets, we only consider the type proposed by Yao [26], which is the most commonly used one in rough set theory. Let U be a universal set and R be an arbitrary relation on U. The left R- and right R-relative sets for an element x in U are defined aslR(x)={y|y∈U,yRx}andrR(x)={y|y∈U,xRy}.Clearly, for eachx∈U,lR-1(x)=rR(x)andrR-1(x)=lR(x), whereR-1is the inverse of R. Recall that the following terminology: (1) R is reflexive ifx∈rR(x)for eachx∈U; (2) R is symmetric iflR(x)=rR(x)for eachx∈U; (3) R is antisymmetric if xRy and yRx implies thatx=y; (4) R is transitive ifx∈rR(y)implies thatrR(x)⊆rR(y); (5) R is an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive; and (6) R is a partial order if R is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.Yao and Yao [27] considered three different equivalent forms based on element, granule, and subsystem definitions. This paper only considers the following element-based definition of generalized rough sets.Definition 2.126Let U be a universal set and R be an arbitrary binary relation on U. For each subset X of U, we define two subsets,R̲(X)={x|rR(x)⊆X}andR‾(X)={x|rR(x)∩X≠∅},called the lower and upper approximations of X respectively.We need the following three simple but important properties in this paper.(1)R‾({x})=lR(x)for eachx∈U.Distributivity with respect to union:R‾(∪i∈IXi)=∪i∈IR‾(Xi)for any given index set I, whereXi⊆U.R‾(X)=∪x∈XlR(x)for eachX⊆U.As generalizations of Pawlak rough sets, many types of covering rough set approximations were proposed by [2]. However, we only focus on one generalization in this paper.Definition 2.21,32Let U be a given universal set, andC={K|K⊆U}be a family of nonempty subsets of U. If∪K∈CK=U, then C is called a covering of U. If C is a covering of U, then we call the ordered pair(U,C)a covering approximation space.N(x)=∩{K|K∈C,x∈K}is called a neighborhood of an elementx∈U. The minimal description of an elementx∈Uis defined asMd(x)={K|x∈K∈C∧(∀S∈C,x∈S⊆K⇒K=S)}.Throughout this paper, for any given covering approximation space(U,C), we define the binary relation R on U to satisfylR(x)=N(x)for eachx∈U. We use this relation to build a relationship between generalized rough sets and covering rough sets. It is easily verified that R is a quasiorder (a reflexive and transitive binary relation) on U. It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between quasiorders on U and quasi-discrete topologies [10] on U. Clearly,R̲is an interior andR‾a closure for a quasi-discrete topologyσR={X|X⊆U,R̲(X)=X}on U.Bonikowski et al. [1] and Zhu [32] proposed the following covering approximations.Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. For anyX⊆U, the lower and upper approximations of X are defined asC̲(X)=∪{K|K∈C,K⊆X}andC‾(X)=∪{N(x)|x∈X-C̲(X)}∪C̲(X), respectively.Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. ThenK=∪x∈KN(x)for allK∈C.Suppose thatK∈Candx∈K. Becausex∈N(x), we haveK⊆∪x∈KN(x). Conversely,∪x∈KN(x)⊆Kis clear. SoK=∪x∈KN(x), and the proposition is proved.□Reduction is an important concept in covering rough set theory, and many algorithms for reduction in coverings have been proposed [32]. The following definition of reduction in a covering was proposed by Zhu and Wang [32].Definition 2.432Let C be a covering of U withK∈C.(1)If K is a union of some elements inC-{K}, we say that K is reducible in C. Otherwise, K is irreducible.If every element of C is irreducible, we say that C is irreducible. Otherwise, C is reducible.IfC′⊆CandC′is an irreducible covering of U, thenC′is called a reduction of C.Note that each covering C has a unique reduction denoted byred(C). As mentioned above, bothred(C)and{N(x)|x∈U}are coverings of U. In general,red(C)≠{N(x)|x∈U}, that is,{N(x)|x∈U}is not the reduction of C shown in the following example.Example 2.1LetU={1,2,3,4},K1={1,2},K2={2,3}, andK3={3,4}. ThenC={K1,K2,K3}is a covering of U. Moreover,N(1)={1,2},N(2)={2},N(3)={3}, andN(4)={3,4}.N(2)∉C, so{N(x)|x∈U}is not a subset of C, and therefore,{N(x)|x∈U}is not the reduction of C.Observe that, for any given covering C ofU,red(C)is also a covering of U, and thus the lower approximationred(C)̲and the upper approximationred(C)‾are well-defined mappings. Moreover,C̲(X)=red(C)̲(X), andC‾(X)=red(C)‾(X)for eachX⊆U. Naturally, it is interesting to characterize the conditions under which{N(x)|x∈U}forms a reduction of C.This section considers one special type of covering. For a given covering C of U, many authors [28] have studied the necessary and sufficient conditions for{N(x)|x∈U}to form a partition of U. In this section, we consider the conditions under which{N(x)|x∈U}forms a reduction of C. We show that the covering upper approximationC‾coincides with the upper approximationR‾, which is induced by the reflexive and transitive relation R.Lemma 3.1Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. Then, forX⊆U:(1)C̲(X)=∪x∈C̲(X)N(x);C‾(X)=R‾(X).(1)Note that, for eachx∈U, we havex∈N(x). Supposey∈C̲(X), then∃K∈Csuch thaty∈K, thusy∈∪x∈C̲(X)N(x). This implies thatC̲(X)⊆∪x∈C̲(X)N(x).Conversely, suppose thaty∈N(x),x∈C̲(X). Then there exists someK∈Csuch thatx∈K⊆X. Soy∈N(x)⊆K⊆X, andK∈C. Thusy∈C̲(X), and∪x∈C̲(X)N(x)⊆C̲(X).C‾(X)=∪{N(x)|x∈X-C̲(X)}∪C̲(X)=∪x∈X-C̲(X)N(x)∪(∪x∈C̲(X)N(x))=∪x∈XN(x)=∪x∈XlR(x)=R‾(X). This proves the lemma.□Lemma 3.1 (2) shows that the covering upper approximationC‾can be completely replaced byR‾. Thus many properties ofC‾can be derived from the reflexive and transitive relation R. Observe that, for any given covering C ofU,N={N(x)|x∈U}is also a covering of U which we call the covering induced by C. Thus, we have new approximationsN̲andN‾for the covering N induced by C.Lemma 3.2For the covering N induced by C, the neighborhood of an elementx∈UisN(x).BecauseN(x)is the least element in{N(y)|y∈U,x∈N(y)}, by the definition of neighborhood, we haveN(x)=∩x∈N(y),y∈UN(y). That is, for eachx∈U, the neighborhood of x for C coincides with the neighborhood of x for N.□LetU={1,2,3,4}and letC={{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}}be a covering of U. ThenN={N(x)|x∈U}={{1,2},{2},{3},{3,4}}. It is easy to verify that, for eachx∈U, the neighborhood of x for C coincides with the neighborhood of x for N.The following lemma usesR‾andR-1̲to give a concise representation of the approximationsN̲andN‾.For the covering N induced by C, the approximationsN̲andN‾can be written as follows:(1)N̲(X)=∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}=R‾(R-1̲(X));N‾(X)=R‾(X)=C‾(X).(1)Note thatlR(x)=rR-1(x)andrR(x)=lR-1(x)for eachx∈U, whereR-1is the inverse of R. By Definition 2.3,N̲(X)=∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}=∪{lR(x)|lR(x)⊆X}=∪{lR(x)|rR-1(x)⊆X}=∪x∈R-1̲(X)lR(x)=R‾(R-1̲(X)).By Definition 2.3,N‾(X)=∪{N(x)|x∈X-N̲(X)}∪N̲(X)=∪x∈XN(x)=∪x∈XlR(x)=R‾(X)=C‾(X).□Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. ThenR‾(K)=Kfor allK∈C, andR‾(C̲(X))=C̲(X)for allX⊆U.For eachK∈C, by Proposition 2.1,K=∪x∈KN(x)=∪x∈KlR(x)=R‾(K). By the definition ofC̲, forX⊆U,C̲(X)is a union of elements in C. That is,C̲(X)=∪K∈C,K⊆XK=∪K∈C,K⊆XR‾(K)=R‾(C̲(X)). This proves the proposition.□Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. ThenC̲(X)⊆R-1̲(X)for eachX⊆U.ForX⊆U, suppose thatx∈C̲(X). There exists someK∈Csuch thatx∈K⊆X, thusN(x)⊆Xandx∈R-1̲(X). This proves the lemma.□The following proposition establishes the relationship amongN̲,N‾,Rand C.Proposition 3.2Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. Then:(1)N̲(X)=R-1̲(X)for eachX⊆U;N‾(X)=R‾(X);C̲(X)⊆N̲(X).(1)Suppose thaty∈∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}. There exists some x in U such thaty∈N(x)⊆X. By transitivity ofR,N(y)⊆N(x)⊆X. This means thaty∈R-1̲(X)and∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}⊆R-1̲(X).Conversely, suppose thaty∈R-1̲(X). ThenN(y)⊆X. By reflexivity ofR,y∈N(y)⊆X. That is,y∈∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}, andR-1̲(X)⊆∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}. This completes the proof.and (3) follow from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4.□For any given covering C of U, the following lemma shows thatN={N(x)|x∈U}is always an irreducible covering of U.Lemma 3.5Let C be a covering of U. ThenN={N(x)|x∈U}is an irreducible covering of U.Clearly, N is a covering of U. We now show that N is irreducible. Suppose thatN(x)=∪i∈IN(xi)and thatN(x)≠N(xi)for alli∈I. Then there exists somei∈Isuch thatx∈N(xi), soN(x)⊆N(xi). ButN(xi)⊆N(x), thusN(xi)=N(x). This is a contradiction.□In fact, by the same argument, we can show that, for any given reflexive and transitive relation S on U, both{lS(x)|x∈U}and{rS(x)|x∈U}are irreducible coverings of U.For a subsetX⊆U, by Lemma 3.4,C̲(X)⊆R-1̲(X)=N̲(X). The following theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for{N(x)|x∈U}to form a reduction of C.Theorem 3.1Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. Then the following conditions are equivalent:(1){N(x)|x∈U}⊆C;For allx∈U,Md(x)={N(x)}, whereMd(x)is the minimal description of an element x;red(C)={N(x)|x∈U};C̲(X)=N̲(X)for allX⊆U;C̲(X)=R-1̲(X)for allX⊆U;C̲is an interior for some quasi-discrete topological space(U,σ)[10];C̲(∩i∈IXi)=∩i∈IC̲(Xi)for any given index set,I,i∈I, andXi⊆U.LetN={N(x)|x∈U}.(1)⇒(2): For eachx∈U,N(x)is the least element in{K|K∈C,x∈K}, soMd(x)={N(x)}.(2)⇒(3): Clearly, for eachx∈U,N(x)∈C. By Proposition 2.1, every subset K in C is a union of neighborhoods in N. By Lemma 3.4,red(C)=N.(3)⇒(4): ForX⊆U,C̲(X)=red(C)̲(X)=∪{N(x)|N(x)⊆X}=N̲(X).(4)⇒(5):C̲(X)=N̲(X)=R-1̲(X)for allX⊆U.(5)⇒(1): Forx∈U, becausex∈R-1̲(N(x))=C̲(N(x)), there exists someK∈Csuch thatx∈KandK⊆N(x). ThusN(x)⊆K⊆N(x), that is,N(x)=K∈C, and{N(x)|x∈U}⊆C.(5)⇒(6): Letσ={X|X⊆U,C̲(X)=X}. Then(U,σ)is a quasi-discrete topological space, andC̲is an interior for the topologyσ.(6)⇒(7)is clear.(7)⇒(5): ForX⊆U, becauseU-X=∪x∉X{x}, by De Morgan’s law, we haveX=∩x∉X(U-{x}). SoC̲(X)=∩x∉XC̲(U-{x})andR-1̲(X)=∩x∉XR-1̲(U-{x}). We now show thatC̲(U-{x})=R-1̲(U-{x}).Observe thatC̲(U-{x})=∪{K|K∈C,x∉K}andR-1̲(U-{x})=∪{N(y)|x∉N(y)}. Ify∈C̲(U-{x}), then there exists someK∈Csuch thaty∈Kandx∉K, soy∈N(y)andx∉N(y). That is,y∈R-1̲(U-{x})andC̲(U-{x})⊆R-1̲(U-{x}).Conversely, suppose thaty∈R-1̲(U-{x}). Then there exists somez∈Usuch thaty∈N(z)andx∉N(z). So there exists someK∈Csuch thatN(z)⊆Kandx∉K. That is,y∈C̲(U-{x})andR-1̲(U-{x})⊆C̲(U-{x}). By the above arguments,R-1̲(U-{x})=C̲(U-{x})andC̲(X)=R-1̲(X). The theorem is proved.□LetU={1,2,3,4},K1={1},K2={2},K3={1,3},K4={2,4}, andK5={1,2}. ThenC={K1,K2,K3,K4,K5}is a covering of U. We see thatN(1)={1},N(2)={2},N(3)={1,3},N(4)={2,4},R={(1,1),(1,3),(2,2),(2,4),(3,3),(4,4)}, andR-1={(1,1),(3,1),(2,2),(4,2),(3,3),(4,4)}. Moreover,{N(x)|x∈U}={K1,K2,K3,K4}is the reduction of C. It is easy to verify thatC̲(X)=R-1̲(X)for eachX⊆U.IfN={N(x)|x∈U}is a reduction of a covering C, then all properties of the approximationsC̲andC‾can be derived from the approximationsN̲andN‾respectively.Suppose thatN={N(x)|x∈U}is a reduction of a covering C. Then, forX⊆U:(1)C̲(X)=Xif and only ifC‾(X)=X;C̲andC‾are dual to each other if and only if R is an equivalence relation on U.(1)By Theorem 3.1,C̲=R-1̲andC‾=R‾. Thus (1) is equivalent to the following proposition:R-1̲(X)=Xif and only ifR‾(X)=X.In fact, by Proposition 2.1(8) of [12],R‾(R-1̲(X))⊆X⊆R-1̲(R‾(X))for eachX⊆U. IfC̲(X)=X, thenR-1̲(X)=X, soR‾(X)⊆X⊆R‾(X)andR‾(X)=X, that is,C‾(X)=X.Conversely, ifC‾(X)=X, thenR‾(X)=X, soX⊆R-1̲(R‾(X))=R-1̲(X)⊆X, which means thatR-1̲(X)=X, that is,C̲(X)=X.Note that R is reflexive and transitive. ThenC̲andC‾are dual to each other if and only ifR-1̲=R̲, if and only ifR-1=R, if and only if R is symmetric, if and only if R is an equivalence relation on U.□This section considers another special type of covering. Proposition 3.3 shows that, if N is the reduction of C, then the approximationsC̲andC‾are dual to each other if and only ifN={N(x)|x∈U}is a partition of U. Naturally, we need to consider the conditions under whichC̲andC‾are dual to each other. In general, the approximationsC̲andC‾are not dual to each other. This can be seen from the following example.Example 4.1Let C be the covering given in Example 3.2. LetX={1,2}. ThenC‾(X)={1,2},-X={3,4},C̲(-X)=∅, and-C̲(-X)=U≠{1,2}. ThusC̲andC‾are not dual to each other, where-Xis the complement of X in U.The following theorem gives conditions under whichC̲andC‾are dual to each other.Theorem 4.1Let C be a covering of U. Then the following conditions are equivalent:(1)C̲(X)=R̲(X)for eachX⊆U;R is an equivalence relation, andred(C)={N(x)|x∈U};For eachX⊆U,(C̲(X),C‾(X))is a Pawlak rough set;The approximationsC̲andC‾are dual to each other.Recall that R is reflexive and transitive.(1)⇒(2): IfC̲(X)=R̲(X)for eachX⊆U, then by Lemma 3.4,C̲(X)=R̲(X)⊆R-1̲(X), and using duality,R-1‾(X)⊆R‾(X)for eachX⊆U. This means thatR-1⊆R. Now suppose that xRy, in which case(y,x)∈R-1⊆R, so yRx and R are symmetric. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on U, and{N(x)|x∈U}is a partition of U. BecauseR-1=R, we haveC̲(X)=R̲(X)=R-1̲(X), and by Theorem 3.1,red(C)={N(x)|x∈U}.(2)⇒(1): Suppose that R is an equivalence relation on U andred(C)={N(x)|x∈U}. By Theorem 3.1,C̲(X)=R-1̲(X)=R̲(X)for allX⊆U.(1)⇒(3): By the proof of(1)⇒(2),Ris an equivalence relation on U,C̲(X)=R̲(X), andC‾(X)=R‾(X)for allX⊆U. Therefore,(C̲(X),C‾(X))is a rough set in the sense of Pawlak.(3)⇒(1): ForX⊆U, becauseC‾(X)=R‾(X)and(C̲(X),C‾(X))is a rough set in the sense of Pawlak, we haveC‾(X)=R̲(X).(1)⇔(4): By Lemma 3.1(2), for allX⊆U,C‾(X)=R‾(X), and thusC̲andC‾are dual to each other if and only ifC̲(X)=R̲(X). This completes the proof.□The next example illustrates Theorem 4.1.Example 4.2LetU={1,2,3,4},K1={1},K2={2},K3={1,2},K4={3,4}, andK5={1,3,4}. ThenC={K1,K2,K3,K4,K5}is a covering of U. It is easy to see thatN(1)={1},N(2)={2}, andN(3)=N(4)={3,4}.{N(1),N(2),N(3),N(4)}is a partition of U, and it is also a reduction of C. Thus, for eachX⊆U,(C̲(X),C‾(X))is a rough set in the sense of Pawlak.Note thatC̲=R̲is a very strong Condition. Theorem 4.1 has the following interesting corollary.Let C be a covering of U. IfC̲(X)=R̲(X)for eachX⊆U, then{N(x)|x∈U}is both a partition of U and the reduction of the covering C.By Theorem 3.1, R is an equivalence relation on U, so{N(x)|x∈U}is a partition of U. Also,{N(x)|x∈U}is the reduction of the covering C.□However, if{N(x)|x∈U}is a partition of U, then R is an equivalence relation on U, and by Lemma 3.2, we haveC̲(X)⊆R-1̲(X)=R̲(X)for eachX⊆U. We cannot then guarantee that{N(x)|x∈U}is the reduction of C. This can be seen from the following example.Example 4.3LetU={1,2,3,4},K1={1,2},K2={2,3},K3={3,4},K4={1,4}andK5={1}. ThenC={K1,K2,K3,K4,K5}is a covering of U. It is easy to see thatN(1)={1},N(2)={2},N(3)={3}, andN(4)={4}.{N(1),N(2),N(3),N(4)}is a partition of U, however,N={N(1),N(2),N(3),N(4)}⊆Cdoes not hold, and N is not the reduction of C.Conversely, if{N(x)|x∈U}is the reduction of C, we also cannot guarantee that{N(x)|x∈U}is a partition of U. This can be seen from Example 3.2. Therefore, for any covering C ofU,{N(x)|x∈U}being the reduction of C is different from{N(x)|x∈U}being a partition of U.Other than equivalence relations, another important type of binary relation on a universal set U is partial orders. Let S be a partial order on U. Then the set U together with S is called a poset which we denote by(U,S). It is well known that posets are useful in set theory, Boolean algebra, sorting and searching.An axiomatic approach to rough sets is appropriate for studying the mathematical structure of rough sets, and many types of generalized rough sets have been axiomatized [10,32]. However, rough sets based on a partial order have not yet been axiomatized. In this section, we present an axiomatic system that characterizes lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order.Yun et al. [28] studied the conditions for a neighborhood{N(x)|x∈U}to form a partition of U. These conditions are equivalent to R being an equivalence relation on U. Furthermore, R is an equivalence relation if and only if R is symmetric. Thus, the conditions for a neighborhood{N(x)|x∈U}to form a partition of U are equivalent to the symmetric property of R. In contrast to the symmetric property of R, we consider the antisymmetric property of R. That is, we study the conditions under which R is a partial order. Because R is reflexive and transitive,(U,R)is a poset if and only if R is antisymmetric. We need a technical lemma.Lemma 5.1Let S be a binary relation on U. Then S is a partial order if and only if S satisfies the following conditions:(1)x∈lS(x)for eachx∈U;iflS(x)=lS(y), thenx=y;ify∈lS(x)andz∈lS(y), thenz∈lS(x).If S is a partial order, then conditions (1) and (3) are clear. We only need to prove (2). By reflexiveness,y∈lS(y)=lS(x), and thus ySx. Similarly, xSy using the antisymmetric property of S, sox=y.Conversely, suppose that S satisfies conditions (1)–(3). By (1) and (3), S is reflexive and transitive. Suppose that xSy and ySx. We need to show thatx=y. By xSy, we havex∈lS(y), and using the transitivity of S, we havelS(x)⊆lS(y). Similarly,lS(y)⊆lS(x), which means thatlS(x)=lS(y), and so we obtainx=y.□As an application of Lemma 5.1, we have the following corollaries.Corollary 5.1Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space andP(U)be the power set of U. Then(U,R)is a poset if and only if the mappingN:U→P(U)is injective. That is, ifN(x)=N(y), thenx=y. Thus, if U is a finite universal set, then(U,R)is a poset if and only if|{N(x)|x∈U}|=|U|, where|U|is the cardinality of U.Observe thatσR={X|X∈P(U),R̲(X)=X}is a topology on U. For the topological space(U,σR), the closure operator isR‾withR‾({x})=lR(x)=N(x)for eachx∈U. Recall that(U,σR)is aT0-space[6]ifx≠y, in which caseR‾({x})≠R‾({y}). Thus, we have the following interesting corollary.Let(U,C)be a covering approximation space. Then the topological space(U,σR)is aT0-space if and only if(U,R)is a poset.Similarly,(U,σR)is aT1-space[6]if and only if R is the equality relation, that is,N(x)={x}for eachx∈U.There exists a unique reflexive and transitive relation S on U such thatf(X)=S‾(X)for eachX⊆Uif and only if the mappingf:P(U)→P(U)satisfies(∪i∈IXi)∪(∪i∈If(Xi))∪f(f(Y))=f(∪i∈IXi∪Y)-f(∅)for any given index set I, whereXi,Y∈P(U).As a corollary of Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, we obtain an axiomatic system that characterizes the upper approximation induced by a partial order.Theorem 5.1Let U be a universal set and letP(U)be the power set of U. Suppose thatf:P(U)→P(U)is a unary operator. Then there exists a unique partial order S on U such thatf(X)=S‾(X)for all subsets X of U if and only if f satisfies the following conditions:(1)(∪i∈IXi)∪(∪i∈If(Xi))∪f(f(Y))=f(∪i∈IXi∪Y)-f(∅)for any given index set I, whereXi,Y∈P(U);Iff({x})=f({y}), thenx=y.Let S be a partial order on U and letf=S‾. Then it is easy to verify that f satisfies requirements (1) and (2).Conversely, if f satisfies requirements (1) and (2), then by Lemma 5.2, there exists a unique reflexive and transitive relation S on U such thatf=S‾. By Lemma 4.1, condition (2) guarantees that S is antisymmetric. Thus S is a partial order on U.□Note that Theorem 5.1(1) is equivalent to the following conditions [11]:(1)f(∅)=∅:f(∪i∈IXi)=∪i∈If(Xi)for any given index set I, whereXi∈P(U)(moreover, if U is a finite set, then this condition is equivalent tof(X∪Y)=f(X)∪f(Y)forX,Y⊆U);X⊆f(X)for eachX⊆U;f(f(X))⊆f(X)for eachX⊆U.Moreover, if U is a finite set, then Theorem 5.1(1) is equivalent toX∪f(X)∪f(f(Y))=f(X∪Y)-f(∅)for allX,Y∈P(U).The following dual theorem gives an axiomatization of the lower approximation induced by a partial order.Theorem 5.2Let U be a universal set and letP(U)be the power set of U. Suppose thatg:P(U)→P(U)is a unary operator. Then there exists a unique partial order S on U such thatg(X)=S̲(X)for all subset X of U if and only if f satisfies the following conditions:(1)g(U)=U;(∩i∈IXi)∩(∩i∈Ig(Xi))∩g(g(Y))=g(∩i∈IXi∩Y)for any given index set I, whereXi,Y∈P(U);Ifg(-{x})=g(-{y}), thenx=y.It is easy to verify that conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent to the following:(a)g(U)=U;g(∩i∈IXi)=∩i∈Ig(Xi)for any given index set I, whereXi∈P(U);g(X⊆X)for eachX⊆U;g(g(X))=g(X)for eachX⊆U.Thus there exists a unique binary relation S on U such thatg(X)=S̲(X)for eachX⊆U. Condition (3) is equivalent to the statement thatS̲(-{x})=S̲(-{y})impliesx=y. By duality, this is equivalent to the statement thatS‾({x})=S‾({y})impliesx=y. That is,lS(x)=lS(y)impliesx=y. By Lemma 5.1, S is a partial order.□Moreover, if U is a finite set, then Theorem 5.2(2) can be replaced byX∩g(X)∩g(g(Y))=g(X∩Y)for allX,Y∈P(U).Thus we have given an axiomatic system that characterizes the lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we focus on one type of covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. Using a reflexive and transitive relation R defined by a covering C, we have established a relationship between covering rough sets and generalized rough sets induced by binary relations. For a given covering C of U, we have obtained three results. First, we have given necessary and sufficient conditions for{N(x)|x∈U}to form a reduction of C. Second, we have obtained conditions under whichC‾andC̲are dual to each other. Finally, we have given an axiomatic system for lower and upper approximations induced by a partial order. The results in this paper may have practical applications in the areas of machine learning, knowledge extraction and reduction, cognitive science, and so on. An important problem is how to apply the results given in this paper to covering reduction algorithms in information systems.
