A quaternion rational surface is a surface generated from two rational space curves by quaternion multiplication. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how to apply syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. We show that we can easily construct three special syzygies for a quaternion rational surface from a μ-basis for one of the generating rational space curves. The implicit equation of any quaternion rational surface can be computed from these three special syzygies and inversion formulas for the non-singular points on quaternion rational surfaces can be constructed. Quaternion rational ruled surfaces are generated from the quaternion product of a straight line and a rational space curve. We investigate special μ-bases for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and use these special μ-bases to provide implicitization and inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces. Finally, we show how to determine if a real rational surface is also a quaternion rational surface.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A quaternion rational surface is a special real rational surface constructed from two rational space curves by quaternion multiplication. This construction allows us to change the location, orientation, and shape of a rational surface by manipulating two simple curves that generate the surface. Moreover, rotating each curve that generates the surface by a constant angle θ about a fixed axis through the origin will rotate the entire surface by the same constant angle θ about the same fixed axis through the origin (see Section 4). Examples include the Möbius strip, generated from the quaternion product of a line and a circle; pipelike surfaces, generated from the quaternion product of a circle and a rational curve; and a masklike surface, generated from the quaternion product of two non-coplanar circles—see Section 4 for further details.There is another method for generating special rational curves and surfaces by quaternion multiplication. R. Krasauskas and S. Zube construct quaternion rational curves and surfaces by allowing quaternion weights as well as quaternion control points in classical rational Bézier curves and surfaces [15,24]. They show that Bézier patches on Dupin cyclides can be generated in this manner. This quaternion technique is an extension to 3-dimensions of complex rational Bézier curves, which are the quotients of two complex valued functions in Bézier form constructed using complex control points and complex weights [17,23]. These quaternion rational curves and surfaces are invariant under Möbius transformations. However, it is not so easy to construct rational curves and surfaces in 3-dimensions using this quaternion approach, since the quaternion weights and quaternion control points cannot be freely chosen. In contrast, in our approach there is no constraint on the rational space curves whose quaternion products generate our quaternion rational surfaces. Moreover, our quaternion rational surfaces are invariant under double isoclinic rotations ofR4(see Section 4 for further details).The goal of this paper is to show how to apply syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. It is difficult to find syzygies, and especially μ-bases, for general rational surfaces [10]. Computing the implicit equation for a general rational surface from a μ-basis is still an open problem [4]. However, there is a simple relation between syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces and syzygies of the corresponding rational space curves that generate these surfaces. Based on this relation, syzygies for quaternion rational surfaces can be calculated easily. Indeed, we can get three special syzygies for any quaternion rational surface from a μ-basis of one of the corresponding rational space curves. Moreover, these three syzygies can be used to compute the implicit equation, to construct inverse formulas and to calculate all the singularities of the quaternion rational surface.A quaternion rational ruled surface is a particular quaternion rational surface constructed from the quaternion product of a straight line and a rational space curve. Unlike the computation of μ-bases for general rational ruled surfaces [7], we show that μ-bases for quaternion rational ruled surfaces can be calculated directly without performing any Gaussian elimination. We then use these special μ-bases to compute the implicit equations as well as simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces.This paper is organized in the following fashion. We begin in Section 2 by recalling some preliminary results about syzygies for rational space curves and rational surfaces. In Section 3 we review some basic facts about quaternions and in Section 4 we define quaternion rational surfaces and we provide some interesting examples of such surfaces. We show in Section 5 that syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces can be calculated from syzygies of the rational space curves that generate these surfaces. We build a sparse resultant matrix in Section 6 for three of these syzygies generated from a μ-basis for one of the rational space curves that generate this surface, and we prove that the determinant of this sparse resultant matrix is the exact implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface without any extraneous factors. We also use ratios of subdeterminants of this sparse resultant matrix to construct inversion formulas for the non-singular points on quaternion rational surfaces. Section 7 is devoted to the study of singularities on quaternion rational surfaces. In Section 8, we investigate μ-bases that are easy to construct for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and we show how to use these special μ-bases to compute implicit equations and simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces. We give necessary and sufficient conditions in Section 9 for a real rational surface to be a quaternion rational surface — that is, for a real rational surface to be the quaternion product of two rational space curves. We also include two appendices. In Appendix A, we discuss three equivalent notions of singularities of order r on rational surfaces of degree n. In Appendix B, we provide an example to illustrate how to compute all the singularities on a quaternion rational surface.We begin with a brief review for the uninitiated of syzygies and μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces. Knowledgeable readers may skip this section.Consider a degree m rational space curve in homogeneous formp(s)=(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))∈R[s]4,wheregcd(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))=1and p0(s) is the homogeneous coordinate (i.e., the denominator whenp0(s)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0). The vector of polynomials p(s) can be expressed byp(s)=∑i=0m(p0i,p1i,p2i,p3i)siwith the leading coefficient vector (p0m, p1m, p2m, p3m) ≠ 0. For brevity, the leading coefficient vector (p0m, p1m, p2m, p3m) is denoted by LV(p(s)); the degree of p(s) is denoted by deg(p(s)).A syzygy of p(s) is a vector of polynomialsl(s)=(l0(s),l1(s),l2(s),l3(s))such thatp(s)·l(s)=p0(s)l0(s)+p1(s)l1(s)+p2(s)l2(s)+p3(s)l3(s)≡0.Letsyz(p(s))=syz(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))be the set of all syzygies of p(s). It is known that syz(p(s)) is a free module overR[s]with a basis consisting of three elements [9].Definition 1Three syzygies r0(s), r1(s) and r2(s) are called a μ-basis for a rational space curve p(s) if1.r0(s), r1(s), r2(s) are a basis of syz(p(s)). That is, any syzygy l(s) of p(s) can be expressed byl(s)=∑i=02hi(s)ri(s), wherehi(s)∈R[s],i=0,1,2.Let deg(r0(s)) ≤ deg(r1(s)) ≤ deg(r2(s)). Then there does not exist another basisr˜0(s),r˜1(s),r˜2(s)of syz(p(s)) withdeg(r˜0(s))≤deg(r˜1(s))≤deg(r˜2(s)), such thatdeg(r˜i(s))<deg(ri(s))for anyi=0,1,2.There is an efficient algorithm to compute a μ-basis for any rational space curve based on Gaussian elimination [21].One of the important properties of μ-bases concerns their outer product. Consider three vectorsri=(ri0,ri1,ri2,ri3),i=0,1,2. The outer product of r0, r1, r2 is defined by[r0,r1,r2]=(|r01r02r03r11r12r13r21r22r23|,1em0ex−|r00r02r03r10r12r13r20r22r23|,1em0ex|r00r01r03r10r11r13r20r21r23|,1em0ex−|r00r01r02r10r11r12r20r21r22|).μ-Bases have the following important properties:Proposition 2[5]Letri(s),i=0,1,2be a μ-basis for a rational space curvep(s). Then1.deg(r0(s))+deg(r1(s))+deg(r2(s))=deg(p(s)).LV(ri(s)),i=0,1,2, are linearly independent.[r0(s),r1(s),r2(s)]=λp(s)for some non-zero constant λ.Relationships between the singularities of rational space curves and their μ-bases have also been investigated [6,14,18,19,22]. In particular, we have the following result.Proposition 3[22]Letr0(s), r1(s), r2(s) be a μ-basis forp(s), and letp(s,u),ri(s,u),i=0,1,2be the homogenizations ofp(s),ri(s),i=0,1,2. ThenX0=(w0,x0,y0,z0)is a point onp(s, u) of order k if and only ifdeg(gcd(r0(s,u)·X0,r1(s,u)·X0,r2(s,u)·X0))=k.ThusX0=(w0,x0,y0,z0)is a point not on the curve p(s, u) if and only ifgcd(r0(s,u)·X0,r1(s,u)·X0,r2(s,u)·X0)=1.We can also calculate all the singularities of a rational space curve from a μ-basis for the curve; for details, see [18,19].Consider a properly parametrized bi-degree (m, n) rational surface in homogenous formS(s,t)=(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t)),where a(s, t), b(s, t), c(s, t), d(s, t) ∈ R[s, t] are polynomials of bi-degree (m, n), the function a(s, t) is the homogeneous coordinate (i.e., the denominator whena(s,t)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0) andgcd(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t))=1.A syzygy of S(s, t) is a vector of polynomialsl(s,t)=(A(s, t), B(s, t), C(s, t), D(s, t)) such thatS(s,t)·l(s,t)=a(s,t)A(s,t)+b(s,t)B(s,t)+c(s,t)C(s,t)+d(s,t)D(s,t)≡0.Letsyz(S(s,t))=syz(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t))be the set of all syzygies of S(s, t). It is known that syz(S(s, t)) is a free module over R[s, t] with a basis consisting of three elements [4].Geometrically, any syzygy l(s, t) of S(s, t) can be interpreted as a moving planeL(s,t,w,x,y,z)=(A(s,t),B(s,t),C(s,t),D(s,t))·(w,x,y,z)=A(s,t)w+B(s,t)x+C(s,t)y+D(s,t)z=0.The planeL(s,t,w,x,y,z)=0changes as the parameters s, t change. Moreover, becauseL(s,t,S(s,t))≡0,we say that the moving plane L(s, t, w, x, y, z) follows the rational surface S(s, t).Definition 4[4]Three syzygies r0(s, t), r1(s, t), r2(s, t) ∈ syz(S(s, t)) are called a μ-basis of the rational surface S(s, t) if[r0(s,t),r1(s,t),r2(s,t)]=λS(s,t)for some non-zero constant λ.Actually any basis of the syzygy module syz(S(s, t)) is a μ-basis of the rational surface S(s, t) (see Corollary 3.1 in [4] for more details). Unlike Definition 1 of μ-bases for rational space curves, Definition 4 has no limitation on the degree for a μ-basis of a rational surface since the homogeneous syzygy modules of rational surfaces are no longer free. Moreover, unlike for rational space curves, we still lack an efficient algorithm for computing μ-bases for rational surfaces [10]. In addition, an efficient algorithm for calculating the implicit equation for a rational surface from a μ-basis is still an open problem.A rational ruled surface is a rational surface of bi-degree (1, n) which is defined in homogeneous formS(s,t)=S0(t)+sS1(t)=(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t)),whereSi(t)=(ai(t),bi(t),ci(t),di(t)),i=0,1are rational space curves of degree n andgcd(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t))=1.Let Ltbe the set of all syzygies of S(s, t) that depend only on the parameter t. Then Ltis a free module overR[t]with a basis consisting of two elements [8]. A basis of Ltof minimal degree is called a μ-basis of the rational ruled surface S(s, t).For brevity, we shall use the notation[a,b]=a0(t)b1(t)−a1(t)b0(t).Proposition 57Lets0=([c,b],[a,c],[b,a],0),s1=([b,a],[d,a],0,[a,b]),s2=([d,c],0,[a,d],[c,a]),s3=(0,[c,d],[d,b],[b,c]),and letgi(t)=gcd(si(t)),i=0,1,2,3. ThenLtis generated bysi/gi(t),i=0,1,2,3.By performing Gaussian elimination on the four special syzygiessi/gi,i=0,1,2,3, we get two non-zero elements, and these two non-zero elements form a basis of minimal degree for Ltand hence a μ-basis for the rational ruled surface S(s, t). Readers can refer to the algorithm described in [7] for more details.Proposition 6[7]Letr0(t), r1(t) be the two non-zero elements of the μ-basis generated by performing Gaussian elimination onsi,i=0,1,2,3, and suppose that deg(r0(t)) ≤deg(r1(t)). Thenr0(t) has the lowest degree in t of any element inLt. Moreover, the sum of deg(r0(t)) and deg(r1(t)) is equal to the implicit degree of the rational ruled surfaceS(s,t)=S0(t)+sS1(t).Letr0(t), r1(t) be a μ-basis for the rational ruled surfaceS(s,t)=S0(t)+sS1(t), and letX=(w,x,y,z). Then the implicit equation ofS(s, t) is given byRes(r0(t)·X,r1(t)·X)=0.Before we can introduce quaternion rational surfaces, we first need to recall some basic facts about quaternions. For further information about the theory and applications of quaternions, see [1,12,13,20].A quaternion can be represented by an ordered quadrupleΓ=(γ0,γ1,γ2,γ3), whereγi,i=0,⋯,3are real numbers. Γ can also be written in the form:Γ=(γ0,v),where the scalar γ0 is called the real part of Γ, denoted by Re(Γ), andv=(γ1,γ2,γ3)∈R3is called the imaginary part of Γ, denoted by Im(Γ). We identify Re(Γ) with the real numbers R, and we identify Im(Γ) with the vectors inR3. The conjugate of the quaternion Γ is given byΓ*=(γ0,−v)=(γ0,−γ1,−γ2,−γ3).Quaternion multiplication is defined in the following fashion. LetΓi=(γi0,vi)=(γi0,γi1,γi2,γi3),i=0,1be two quaternions. The quaternion product of Γ0 and Γ1 is given by(1)Γ0☆Γ1=(γ00γ10−v0·v1,γ00v1+γ10v0+v0×v1).Quaternion multiplication is associative and distributes through addition. However, quaternion multiplication is not commutative. Thus, in general,Γ0☆Γ10.25em0ex≠0.25em0exΓ1☆Γ0; hence, in general, the order of the factors matters. The conjugate of the product is the product of the conjugates in reverse order; that is,(2)(Γ0☆Γ1)*=Γ1*☆Γ0*.A quaternion Γ may also be viewed as a 4-dimensional vector (γ0, γ1, γ2, γ3). The dot product of two quaternions is(3)Γ0·Γ1=∑j=03γ0jγ1j=Re(Γ0☆Γ1*),and the norm of a quaternion is(4)∥Γ∥2=Γ☆Γ*=γ02+γ12+γ22+γ32.Moreover,(5)∥Γ0☆Γ1∥2=(Γ0☆Γ1)☆(Γ0☆Γ1)*=Γ0☆(Γ1☆Γ1*)☆Γ0*=∥Γ0∥2∥Γ1∥2.Quaternion multiplication can also be written as classical matrix multiplication(6)Γ0☆Γ1=Γ0·M1=Γ1·M0,whereM1=(γ10γ11γ12γ13−γ11γ10−γ13γ12−γ12γ13γ10−γ11−γ13−γ12γ11γ10),0.35em0exM0=(γ00γ01γ02γ03−γ01γ00γ03−γ02−γ02−γ03γ00γ01−γ03γ02−γ01γ00).It is easy to check thatM1M1T=(γ102+γ112+γ122+γ132)I,M0M0T=(γ002+γ012+γ022+γ032)I,where I is the4×4identity matrix. Therefore,(7)det(Mi)=(γi02+γi12+γi22+γi32)2=∥Γi∥4,0.35em0exi=0,1.Quaternions can be used to rotate points in 3-dimensions. Let N be a unit vector inR3and let Γ0 be the unit quaternion given byΓ0=(APTARANORMALcos(θ/2),APTARANORMALsin(θ/2)N).Then sandwiching a point p between Γ0 andΓ0*rotates the point p by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N. That is, for any homogeneous pointp=(p0,p1,p2,p3), the mapp0.25em0ex↦0.25em0exΓ0☆p☆Γ0*,rotates the point p by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N.The left and right multiplication mapsp↦Γ0☆p,p↦p☆Γ0,represent double isoclinic rotations inR4[12,16]. Both of these maps rotate quaternions in the plane spanned by (1, 0), (0, N) by the angle θ/2. Moreover, in the plane orthogonal to (1, 0), (0, N) multiplication by Γ0 on the left rotates quaternions by the angle θ/2, whereas multiplication by Γ0 on the right rotates quaternions by the angle−θ/2. Thus left and right multiplication by Γ0 both represent double isoclinic rotations in four dimensions.To construct a quaternion rational surface, we begin with two rational space curves in homogeneous formp(s)=(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))∈R[s]4,q(t)=(q0(t),q1(t),q2(t),q3(t))∈R[t]4,wheregcd(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))=gcd(q0(t),q1(t),q2(t),q3(t))=1,degs(p(s))=m,degt(q(t))=n. A quaternion rational surface is defined by the expression(8)P(s,t)=(w(s,t),x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t))=p(s)☆q(t),where⋆denotes quaternion multiplication.Quaternion rational surfaces are invariant under double isoclinic rotations inR4. Let N be a unit vector inR3and letΓ0=(APTARANORMALcos(θ/2),APTARANORMALsin(θ/2)N). ThenΓ0☆P(s,t)=(Γ0☆p(s))☆q(t)P(s,t)☆Γ0=p(s)☆(q(t)☆Γ0)are also quaternion rational surfaces, so quaternion rational surfaces are invariant under double isoclinic rotations in four dimensions.Applying an arbitrary affine transformation to the two generating curves p(s), q(t) is not equivalent to applying the same affine transformations to the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t). However, sinceΓ0*☆Γ0=1,Γ0☆(p(s)☆q(t))☆Γ0*=(Γ0☆p(s)☆Γ0*)☆(Γ0☆q(t)☆Γ0*).Therefore, rotating the curves p(s), q(t) by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N will also rotate the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) by the angle θ around the line through the origin parallel to the axis N.The quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) has bi-degree (m, n). This surface has no base points. A base point of a rational surface P(s, t) is a pair of parameter values (s0, t0) for whichP(s,t)=(0,0,0,0). Ifp(s0)☆q(t0)=(0,0,0,0),then eitherp(s0)=(0,0,0,0)orq(t0)=(0,0,0,0). Thus, either(s−s0)|gcd(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))or(t−t0)|gcd(q0(t),q1(t),q2(t),q3(t)), which contradicts our assumption thatgcd(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))=gcd(q0(t),q1(t),q2(t),q3(t))=1.So quaternion rational surfaces have no base points. Therefore, the degree of the implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) is 2mn.Next we provide some interesting examples of quaternion rational surfaces.Example 1Möbius Strip; Fig. 1Consider the two rational space curvesp(s)=(1+s2,0,1−s2,2s),q(t)=(2−t,t,t,t).The first curve is a circle, the second is a line. The corresponding quaternion rational surface is the Möbius strip with the parametrizationP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t)=(4−3t+4s2−ts2−st−2s,2t+2ts2+2s−3st+1−s2,t+3ts2+2−2s2−s+2st,2+2s2+4s−st−t+ts2).Consider the two rational space curvesp(s)=(15(1+s2),s,1−s2,2s),q(t)=(3,t+1,t2−t,1).The first curve is a circle, the second is a parabola. The corresponding quaternion rational surface is the pipelike surface with the parametrizationP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t)=(45+45s2−st−3s−t2+t+s2t2−s2t,15t+16+15s2t+14s2+3s−2st2+2st,15t2−15t+15s2t2−15s2t+3−3s2+s+2st,14+16s2+6s+st2−st−t+s2t).Consider the two rational space curvesp(s)=(15(1+s2),s,1−s2,2s),q(t)=(1,t−1,1,3t3−t).The first curve is a circle, the second is a cubic curve. The corresponding quaternion rational surface is the pipelike surface with the parametrizationP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t)=(14+16s2+st+s−6st3,14t−15+16s2t−15s2−s+3t3−3s2t3,16+14s2−3st3+3st−2s,45t3−16t+45s2t3−14s2t+3s+1−s2).Consider the two rational space curvesp(s)=(2(1+s2),s,1−s2,2s),q(t)=(2(1+t2),1−t2,t,2t).These two curves are circles in different planes. The corresponding quaternion rational surface is the masklike surface with the parametrizationP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t)=(4+4t2+4s2+4s2t2−s+st2−t+ts2−4st,2−2t2+2s2−2s2t2+2s+2st2+2t−2ts2−2st,2t+2ts2+2−2s2+2t2−2s2t2−2st+2s−2st2,4t+4ts2+4s+4st2+st−1+t2+s2−s2t2).Quaternion rational surfaces are special rational parametric surfaces, constructed from two rational space curves through quaternion multiplication. We are going to use syzygies to analyze quaternion rational surfaces. To find syzygies for quaternion rational surfaces, we begin with the following lemma.Lemma 8m(s) is a syzygy ofp(s) if and only if Re(m(s)⋆p(s)*) ≡ 0. Similarly, l(s, t) is a syzygy ofP(s, t) if and only if Re(l(s, t)⋆P(s, t)*) ≡ 0.These results follow directly from Eq. (3). □Based on Lemma 8, we get a simple relation between syzygies of quaternion rational surfaces and syzygies of the corresponding rational space curves.Theorem 9Letm(s) be a syzygy ofp(s). Thenm(s)⋆q(t) is a syzygy ofp(s)⋆q(t).Since m(s) is a syzygy of p(s), it follows by Lemma 8 that Re(m(s)⋆p(s)*) ≡ 0. Hence by Eqs. (2) and (4),Re(m(s)☆q(t)☆(p(s)☆q(t))*)=Re(m(s)☆(q(t)☆q(t)*)☆p(s)*)=∥q(t)∥2Re(m(s)☆p(s)*)≡0.Thus by Lemma 8, m(s)⋆q(t) is a syzygy of p(s)⋆q(t). □Let m0(s), m1(s), m2(s) be a μ-basis of the rational space curve p(s). Then every syzygy of p(s)⋆q(t) in the form m(s)⋆q(t) can be expressed bym(s)☆q(t)=∑i=02hi(s)(mi(s)☆q(t)),wherehi(s),i=0,1,2are polynomials. That is, every syzygy of p(s)⋆q(t) in the form m(s)⋆q(t) can be generated frommi(s)☆q(t),i=0,1,2.But not all syzygies of p(s)⋆q(t) can be written in the form m(s)⋆q(t). For example, letni(t),i=0,1,2be a μ-basis of q(t). Similar to Theorem 9, we can prove thatp(s)☆ni(t),i=0,1,2are also syzygies of p(s)⋆q(t). However,degt(m(s)☆q(t))>degt(p(s)☆ni(t)),0.35em0exi=0,1,2for any syzygy m(s) of p(s). Thus,p(s)☆ni(t),i=0,1,2cannot be expressed in the form m(s)⋆q(t). Nevertheless we shall see shortly that the syzygies m0(s)⋆q(t), m1(s)⋆q(t), m2(s)⋆q(t) behave much like a μ-basis for the surface p(s)⋆q(t).To see how, recall that we use [r0, r1, r2] to denote the outer product of the vectors r0, r1, r2. For brevity, let [r, r0, r1, r2] denote the determinant of the4×4matrix (r, r0, r1, r2). Expanding by cofactors of the first column, it follows that(9)[r,r0,r1,r2]=r·[r0,r1,r2].Theorem 10[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=λ∥q(t)∥20.35em0exp(s)☆q(t)for some non-zero constant λ.First observe that[mi(s)☆q(t),m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=0,0.35em0exi=0,1,2.Therefore by Eq. (9),mi(s)☆q(t)·[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=0,0.35em0exii=0,1,2.Hence[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]⊥mi(s)☆q(t),i=0,1,2. But recall thatp(s)☆q(t)0.35em0ex⊥0.35em0exmi(s)☆q(t),0.35em0exi=0,1,2,becausemi(s)☆q(t),i=0,1,2are syzygies of p(s)⋆q(t). Therefore,[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]∥p(s)☆q(t),so there is a polynomial h(s, t) such that[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=h(s,t)0.35em0exp(s)☆q(t).Next we shall show thath(s,t)=λ∥q(t)∥2for some non-zero constant λ. LetMq(t)=(q0(t)q1(t)q2(t)q3(t)−q1(t)q0(t)−q3(t)q2(t)−q2(t)q3(t)q0(t)−q1(t)−q3(t)−q2(t)q1(t)q0(t)).Observe that by Eq. (6) and by Part 3 of Proposition 2,h(s,t)∥p(s)☆q(t)∥2=p(s)☆q(t)·[m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=[p(s)☆q(t),m0(s)☆q(t),m1(s)☆q(t),m2(s)☆q(t)]=[p(s)Mq(t),m0(s)Mq(t),m1(s)Mq(t),m2(s)Mq(t)]=[p(s),m0(s),m1(s),m2(s)]det(Mq(t))=p(s)·[m0(s),m1(s),m2(s)]det(Mq(t))=λ∥p(s)∥2det(Mq(t)),where λ is a non-zero constant. But by Eq. (5),∥p(s)☆q(t)∥2=∥p(s)∥2∥q(t)∥2,and by Eq. (7),det(Mq(t))=∥q(t)∥4.Therefore,h(s,t)∥p(s)∥2∥q(t)∥2=λ∥p(s)∥2∥q(t)∥4. Thush(s,t)=λ∥q(t)∥2. □We shall now use the syzygies constructed in Section 5 to derive implicit equations and inversion formulas for quaternion rational surfaces.A quaternion rational surfacep(s)☆q(t)=(w(s,t),x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t))has no base points, so we can compute the implicit equation for a quaternion rational surface by calculating the Sylvester or Dixon resultant [11] for the three polynomials(10)w0.35em0exx(s,t)−x0.35em0exw(s,t),0.35em0exw0.35em0exy(s,t)−y0.35em0exw(s,t),0.35em0exw0.35em0exz(s,t)−z0.35em0exw(s,t).LetF(w,x,y,z)=0be the implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) of bi-degree (m, n). Using the Sylvester resultant to compute F(w, x, y, z), we get a6mn×6mnmatrix whose entries are linear in the variables w, x, y, z. The determinant of this matrix is equal to w4mn· F(w, x, y, z), where w4mnis an extraneous factor. Using the Cayley/Dixon resultant to compute F(w, x, y, z), we get a2mn×2mnmatrix. However, the entries of this matrix are cubic in the variables w, x, y, z. So once again the Cayley/Dixon resultant also introduces the extraneous factor w4mn.Next we shall show how to compute the implicit equation of a quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) from the determinant of a matrix of size2mn×2mn, whose entries are linear in w, x, y, z and whose determinant has no extraneous factors.Letmi(s),i=0,1,2be a μ-basis for p(s). By Theorem 9, the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) has three special syzygiesmi(s)☆q(t),i=0,1,2. Let(11)MPi(s,t,X)=(mi(s)☆q(t))·X,0.35em0ex0.35em0exi=0,1,2,whereX=(w,x,y,z). Then by constructionMPi(s,t,X)=0,i=0,1,2are three moving planes that follow the surface p(s)⋆q(t). Here we are going to compute the resultant(12)Ress,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)),and we will show that this resultant provides the implicit equation of the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t). Notice, however, that the polynomialsMPi(s,t,X)=(mi(s)☆q(t))·X,i=0,1,2, usually have different bi-degrees in (s, t) —(μi,n),i=0,1,2. So we cannot use the Dixon method to compute this resultant, since the Dixon method requires the bi-degrees to be equal. To proceed, we need to construct a sparse resultant for three generic polynomials f(s, t), g(s, t), h(s, t) of bi-degrees (μ0, n), (μ1, n), (μ2, n), whereμ0+μ1+μ2=m.Given three generic polynomials f(s, t), g(s, t), h(s, t) of bi-degrees (μ0, n), (μ1, n), (μ2, n), we construct a square matrixRs,tof size2mn×2mnby multiplying f, g, h by monomials in the following fashion:((1,s,t,⋯,sμ1+μ2−1tn−1)f,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ2−1tn−1)g,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ1−1tn−1)h)=(1,s,t,⋯,sm−1t2n−1)Rs,t(f,g,h).Proposition 1119Rs,t(f,g,h)is a resultant matrix with respect to s, t for the polynomials f, g, h.Based on Proposition 11, we construct a square matrixRs,t(MP0,MP1,MP2)of size2mn×2mnforMPi(s,t,X),i=0,1,2in the following manner:((1,s,t,⋯,sμ1+μ2−1tn−1)MP0,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ2−1tn−1)MP1,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ1−1tn−1)MP2)=(1,s,t,⋯,sm−1t2n−1)Rs,t(MP0,MP1,MP2).Theorem 12The implicit equation of the parametric surfacep(s)⋆q(t) isF(w,x,y,z)≡det(Rs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))=0.We need to prove three things:(1)det(Rs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))=0for points X on the surface p(s)⋆q(t);det(Rs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))has the correct degree in w, x, y, z;det(Rs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))is not identically zero.To prove (1), recall thatMPi(s,t,X)=0,i=0,1,2, are moving planes that follow the surfaceP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t); thereforeMPi(s,t,P(s,t))≡0,i=0,1,2. Hence for any pointX=P(s0,t0), the resultantdet(Rs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))|X=P(s0,t0)=0,because (s0, t0) is a common root ofMPi(s,t,X)=0,i=0,1,2.To prove (2), we observe that since the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) has no base points, the degree of the implicit equation is 2mn. ButRs,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X))is a2mn×2mnmatrix with linear entries in w, x, y, z; therefore, as required,deg(Ress,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X)))=2mn.It remains to show (3). Choose Y to be any point not on the curve p(s) and letX=Y☆q(t). Then by Eqs. (2)–(4),(mi(s)☆q(t))·(Y☆q(t))=Re((mi(s)☆q(t))☆(Y☆q(t))*)=∥q(t)∥2Re(mi(s)☆Y*)=∥q(t)∥2(mi(s)·Y),0.35em0ex0.35em0exi=0,1,2.Hence up to a constant multipleRess,t(MP0(s,t,X),MP1(s,t,X),MP2(s,t,X))=Ress,t(m0(s)·Y,m1(s)·Y,m2(s)·Y).But, by assumption, Y is not on the curve p(s). Hence by setting the homogeneous parameteru=1in Remark 1 of Section 2.1, m0(s) · Y, m1(s) · Y, m2(s) · Y have no common roots, soRess,t(m0(s)·Y,m1(s)·Y,m2(s)·Y)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0.2em0ex□Consider a quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) withp(s)=(s2+1,1,s+1,s+2),q(t)=(t,t2−1,t−1,t+1).A μ-basis for the curve p(s) ism0=(0,1,1,−1),m1(s)=(1,−1+s,−s,0),m2(s)=(1,2s,−s−1,0).So this quaternion rational surface has three moving planes that follow the surface:MP0=(m0☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z)=((0,1,1,−1)☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z),MP1=(m1(s)☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z)=((1,−1+s,−s,0)☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z),MP2=(m2(s)☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z)=((1,2s,−s−1,0)☆q(t))·(w,x,y,z).Hence,((1,s,t,st)MP0,(1,t)MP1,(1,t)MP2)=(1,s,t,st,t2,st2,t3,st3)Rs,t(MP0,MP1,MP2),whereRs,t(MP0,MP1,MP2)is an8×8matrix whose elements are linear in w, x, y, z. Moreoverdet(Rs,t(MP0,MP1,MP2))=0is the implicit equation of this quaternion rational surface.Inversion formulas are rational expressions for the parameters (s0, t0) of a non-singular point on a rational surface P(s, t) in terms of the coordinatesX0=(w0,x0,y0,z0)of the point on the surface. Next we shall discuss how to derive inversion formulas for quaternion rational surfaces from the implicitization matrices we have just constructed for these surfaces.Consider a quaternion rational surfaceP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t). LetMPi(s,t,X)=0,0.35em0ex0.35em0exi=0,1,2,be the three special moving planes defined in Eq. (11). Then by Theorem 12, the matrix M(X) whose determinant is the implicit equation for the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) can be constructed as follows(13)((1,t,⋯,sμ1+μ2−1tn−1)MP0,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ2−1tn−1)MP1,(1,s,t,⋯,sμ0+μ1−1tn−1)MP2)=(1,s,t,⋯,sm−1t2n−1)M(X).SinceMPi(s0,t0,P(s0,t0))=0,i=0,1,2, it follows by (13) that(14)(1,s0,t0,⋯,s0m−1t02n−1)M(X0)=0,whereX0=P(s0,t0). Based on the drop-of-rank property [2], co-rank(M(X0))=1for a generic non-singular point X0 on the quaternion rational surface P(s, t). If we think of Eq. (14) as a system of linear equations ands0,t0,⋯,s0m−1t02n−1as independent variables, we can solve for s0, t0 by using Cramer’s rule:s0=Cofactor(M21)Cofactor(M11),t0=Cofactor(M31)Cofactor(M11),where Mijis the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the matrix M(X0). In this way we get inversion formulas for non-singular points on a quaternion rational surface P(s, t).In this section, we shall discuss the relation between singularities of quaternion rational surfaces and singularities of the corresponding rational space curves that generate these surfaces.Consider two rational space curves p(s), q(t) and the corresponding quaternion rational surfaceP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t).Theorem 13Suppose thatp0is a singularity of order r on the curvep(s). Thenp0⋆q(t) is a singular locus on the quaternion rational surfacep(s)⋆q(t). Similarly, ifq0is a singularity of order r on the curveq(t), thenp(s)⋆q0is a singular locus on the quaternion rational surfacep(s)⋆q(t).Here we only prove the first part of this theorem, the second part can be proved similarly.Let p(s, u) be the homogenization of p(s). Since p0 is a singularity of order r on the curve p(s), it follows that there are r parameters(si,ui),i=1,⋯,r(r≥2)corresponding to the point p0. That is,p(si,ui)=λip0,where λiare non-zero constants. Therefore, for any point p0⋆q(t0) on the curve p0⋆q(t), there are at least r parameters:(si,ui,t0),i=1,⋯,r, corresponding to the point p0⋆q(t0). Thus by Theorem 21 in the Appendix, any point p0⋆q(t0) on the curve p0⋆q(t) is a singularity of order at least r on the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t). □Based on Theorem 13, we can calculate singular loci on a quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) by computing singularities on the two rational space curves p(s), q(t). However, not all singularities on the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) are generated in this manner.Example 6Consider the two rational space curvesp(s)=(3s+1+s2,s−1+2s2,4s+3s2,2s+s2),q(t)=(2t−4+t2,9t−8−2t2,−2t+t2,−4t+t2+2).The corresponding quaternion rational surface isP(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t), whereP(s,t)=(13st−8s−st2+11t−12−t2−6s2t+10s2+s2t217st−20s−3st2+7t−4−3t2+3s2t−10s2+2s2t224st+2st2−6t+2t2+21s2t−34s−24s2+2−46st+14st2+30s−2t+2−33s2t+10s2t2+22s2).It is easy to check thatp(−1)☆q(2)=30.35em0exp(0)☆q(1)=−6(1,0,1,0).Hence there are two parameters(s0,t0)=(−1,2)and(s1,t1)=(0,1)corresponding to the same point (1, 0, 1, 0). Thus,(w0,x0,y0,z0)=(1,0,1,0)is a singularity on the surface P(s, t). However, both rational space curves p(s), q(t) are quadratic and therefore they have no singularities. Hence, the singularity (1, 0, 1, 0) is not generated from a singularity of one of the corresponding rational space curves.To compute all the singularities on a quaternion rational surface, we can use the implicitization matrices presented in Section 6.1 along with algorithms derived in [3]. Based on the drop-of-rank property [2], we can calculate in this way all the singularities of quaternion rational surfaces. For an example, see Appendix B.In this section, we shall derive two special syzygies for quaternion rational ruled surfaces and show how to use these two special syzygies to derive the implicit equations and simple inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces.Ifdeg(p(s))=1ordeg(q(t))=1, then the quaternion rational surface p(s)⋆q(t) is a particular type of rational ruled surface: a quaternion rational ruled surface. Without loss of generality, here we discuss onlydeg(p(s))=1. In this casep(s)=(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))=u0+u1s,where u0, u1 are two constant vectors inR4. By assumptiongcd(p0(s),p1(s),p2(s),p3(s))=1, so u0, u1 are two linearly independent vectors. Thus, there are two linearly independent constant vectors m0, m1 inR4with the propertymi⊥uj,0.35em0ex0.35em0exi,j=0,1.It follows by Theorem 9 that m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) are two syzygies of p(s)⋆q(t) and these two syzygies depend only on the parameter t.Let Ltbe the set of all syzygies of p(s)⋆q(t) that depend only on the parameter t. Then Ltis a free module overR[t]with a basis consisting of two elements [7]. Next we shall show that the two syzygies m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) are a basis for Lt.Lemma 14Every syzygyl(t) of the quaternion rational ruled surfacep(s)⋆q(t) can be expressed byh0(t)(m0☆q(t))+h1(t)(m1☆q(t))for some polynomials h0(t), h1(t).After a suitable invertible projective transformation, the quaternion rational ruled surface can be transformed into(1,0,0,0)☆q(t)+s((0,1,0,0)☆q(t))Hence for convenience, we assume here thatu0=(1,0,0,0),0.35em0ex0.35em0exu1=(0,1,0,0)Thus the two linearly independent constant vectors perpendicular toui,i=0,1arem0=(0,0,1,0),0.35em0ex0.35em0exm1=(0,0,0,1).After a simple computation using Eq. (1), we getu0☆q(t)=(1,0,0,0)☆q(t)=(q0,q1,q2,q3),u1☆q(t)=(0,1,0,0)☆q(t)=(−q1,q0,−q3,q2),m0☆q(t)=(0,0,1,0)☆q(t)=(−q2,q3,q0,−q1),m1☆q(t)=(0,0,0,1)☆q(t)=(−q3,−q2,q1,q0).Thus the quaternion rational ruled surface p(s)⋆q(t) can be written as(15)P(s,t)=(q0−sq1,q1+sq0,q2−sq3,q3+sq2).Moreover, let s0, s1, s2, s3 be the syzygies in Proposition 5 of Section 2.3. Then again by a simple computations0=(−q1q3−q0q2,q0q3−q1q2,q02+q12,0),s1=(q1q2−q0q3,−q1q3−q0q2,0,q02+q12),s2=(q22+q32,0,−q1q3−q0q2,q1q2−q0q3),s3=(0,q22+q32,q0q3−q1q2,−q1q3−q0q2).Letgi(t)=gcd(si),i=0,1,2,3. Then by Proposition 5, every syzygy of Ltis generated bysi/gi(t),i=0,1,2,3.Next we shall show that s0/g0(t) can be generated bymi☆q(t),i=0,1. If g0(t) is not a constant, let t0 be a root of g0(t). Then(16)q0(t0)2+q1(t0)2=−q1(t0)q3(t0)−q0(t0)q2(t0)=q0(t0)q3(t0)−q1(t0)q2(t0)=0.Thus,q0(t0)=q1(t0)=00.35em0exor0.35em0exq0(t0)=±iq1(t0)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0.•Ifq0(t0)=±iq1(t0)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0, it follows by Eq. (16) thatq2(t0)=±iq3(t0).But recall from Eq. (15) that the quaternion rational ruled surface is in the formP(s,t)=(q0−sq1,q1+sq0,q2−sq3,q3+sq2). ThusP(±i,t0)=(q0(t0)∓iq1(t0),q1(t0)±iq0(t0),q2(t0)∓iq3(t0),q3(t0)±iq2(t0))=(0,0,0,0),so ( ± i, t0) are two base points of the quaternion rational ruled surface P(s, t), which is a contradiction, since the surface P(s, t) has no base points.Based on the above analysis, ifg(t0)=0, thenq0(t0)=q1(t0)=0. Thus g0(t)|gcd(q0, q1). It is easy to show gcd(q0, q1)|g0(t). Thereforegcd(q0,q1)=g0(t).Moreover,s0=(−q1q3−q0q2,q0q3−q1q2,q02+q12,0)=q0(m0☆q(t))+q1(m1☆q(t)).Hence,s0g0=q0gcd(q0,q1)(m0☆q(t))+q1gcd(q0,q1)(m1☆q(t)).Similarly, we can prove thatsi/gi,i=1,2,3are generated bymi☆q(t),i=0,1. □The two syzygiesm0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) have the lowest degree of any elements inLt. Therefore, m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) are a μ-basis ofp(s)⋆q(t). In addition, the sum of the degrees of these two syzygies is equal to the implicit degree of the rational ruled surfacep(s)⋆q(t).By Lemma 14, m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) are a basis of the module Lt. Next we shall discuss the degrees of the two syzygies m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t).Let LC(q(t)) be the leading coefficient vector of q(t). SinceLC(q(t))0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0andLC(mi☆q(t))=mi☆LC(q(t)),i=0,1, it is easy to check that LC(m0⋆q(t)), LC(m1⋆q(t)) are linearly independent if m0, m1 are linearly independent. On the other hand, since any element l(t) of Ltcan be expressed byl(t)=h0(t)(m0☆q(t))+h1(t)(m1☆q(t)),where h0(t), h1(t) are polynomials,deg(l(t))≥deg(m0☆q(t))=deg(m1☆q(t))=deg(q(t)). Therefore, m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) have the lowest degree in t of any element in Lt. Hence m0⋆q(t), m1⋆q(t) are a μ-basis of the surface p(s)⋆q(t). Moreover, the sum of deg(m0⋆q(t)) and deg(m1⋆q(t)) is equal to 2 · deg(q(t)), which is the implicit degree of the quaternion rational ruled surface p(s)⋆q(t).□The implicit equation of the quaternion rational ruled surfacep(s)⋆q(t) is given byF(w,x,y,z)≡Rest((m0☆q(t))·X,(m1☆q(t))·X)=0,whereX=(w,x,y,z).This result follows immediately from Proposition 7. □We can also provide inversion formulas for quaternion rational ruled surfaces as we did for general quaternion rational surfaces. Letn=deg(q(t))and letMPi(t,X)=(mi☆q(t))·X,0.35em0ex0.35em0exi=0,1,whereX=(w,x,y,z). By Corollary 16, the matrix M(X) whose determinant is the implicit equation of the quaternion rational ruled surface p(s)⋆q(t) is constructed as follows:(17)((1,t,⋯,tn−1)MP0,(1,t,⋯,tn−1)MP1)=(1,t,⋯,t2n−1)M(X),SinceMPi(t0,P(s0,t0))=0,i=0,1, it follows by Eq. (17) that(18)(1,t0,⋯,t02n−1)M(X0)=0,whereX0=P(s0,t0). If we think of Eq. (18) as a system of linear equations andt0,⋯,t02n−1as independent variables, we can solve for t0 by using Cramer’s rule:(19)t0=Cofactor(M21)Cofactor(M11),where Mijis the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the matrix M(X0). Thus, for a non-singular pointX0=P(s0,t0)on the quaternion rational ruled surface, we can calculate the corresponding parameter t0 using Eq. (19). However, unlike the system of linear Eqs. (14) for general quaternion rational surfaces, the system of linear Eqs. (18) does not involve the parameter s0. So we cannot get the parameter s0 corresponding to X0 directly from Eq. (18). But quaternion rational ruled surfaces p(s)⋆q(t) are linear in the parameter s, so the other parameter s0 corresponding to X0 can be computed by solving the following system of linear equations:p(s)☆q(t0)=X0,or equivalentlyu0+u1s0=X0☆q(t0)−1.Solving for s0, we find thats0=(X0☆q(t0)−1−u0)☆u1−1.Example 7Consider a quaternion rational ruled surface p(s)⋆q(t) withp(s)=u0+u1s=(1,0,0,−1)+(0,1,1,1)s,q(t)=(1,t2,t+1,t).The two linearly independent constant syzygies of p(s) arem0=(0,−1,1,0),0.35em0ex0.35em0exm1=(1,−1,0,1).By Theorem 15,m0☆q(t)=(−1+t2−t,−1+t,t+1,−t−1−t2),m1☆q(t)=(1+t2−t,t2−2−t,2t+1+t2,0)form a μ-basis for p(s)⋆q(t). Computing the resultant matrix of (m0⋆q(t)) · X, (m1⋆q(t)) · X with respect to t, we getM(X)=(−w+y−x−z0w+y−2x0y−w−z+x−w+y−x−z−x−w+2yw+y−2xw−zy−w−z+xw+x+y−x−w+2y0w−z0w+x+y),whereX=(w,x,y,z). By Corollary 16,F(X)≡det(M(X))=0is the implicit equation for the quaternion rational ruled surface p(s)⋆q(t). Moreover by Eq. (19), given a non-singular pointX0=(w0,x0,y0,z0)on the surface p(s)⋆q(t), the parameter t0 corresponding to X0 ist0=−h1h2,whereh1=y03−2x03−4z0x0y0−z0w0y0+2z0w0x0+7w0x0y0+w02x0−2w02y0−w0x02−w0y02−3y0x02−2z0w02+4z0x02+z0y02,h2=2w03+y03−2z0x0y0−5z0w0y0+7z0w0x0+3w0x0y0+w02x0+5w02y0−w0x02−5w0y02+y0x02+2x0y02+2z0w02+5z0x02+2z0y02.Solving the system of linear equationsp(s)☆q(t0)=X0, we gets0=−x0h1h2+x0h12−y0h22+y0h2h1−y0h12−x0h22x0(h12+h2h1+h22).In this section, we shall give necessary and sufficient conditions for a real rational surface to be a quaternion rational surface. Consider a real rational surface in homogeneous form with a proper parametrizationS(s,t)=(w(s,t),x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t)).Lemma 17If for any parameter s0,gcd(w(s0,t),x(s0,t),y(s0,t),z(s0,t))0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex1,thenS(s, t) is not a quaternion rational surface.Ifgcd(w(s0,t),x(s0,t),y(s0,t),z(s0,t))=h(t)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex1, let t0 be a root ofh(t)=0. Then (s0, t0) is a base point of the rational surface S(s, t). But quaternion rational surfaces have no base points. So in this case, the rational surface S(s, t) is not a quaternion rational surface. □Choose any parameter values=s0. Ifgcd(w(s0,t),x(s0,t),y(s0,t),z(s0,t))=1, then setp^(s,t)=S(s,t)☆S*(s0,t)∥S(s0,t)∥2.Theorem 18S(s, t) is a quaternion rational surface if and only ifp^(s,t)=p^(s)∈R[s]4andgcd(p^(s))=1.(⇒) If S(s, t) is a quaternion rational surface, then there exist two rational space curves p(s), q(t) such thatS(s,t)=p(s)☆q(t),andgcd(p(s))=gcd(q(t))=1. Thus,p(s0)0.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex(0,0,0,0)and∥p(s0)∥20.25em0ex≠0.25em0ex0. Hence by Eqs. (2) and (5),(20)p^(s,t)=(p(s)☆q(t))☆(p(s0)☆q(t))*∥p(s0)☆q(t)∥2=(p(s)☆q(t))☆(q*(t)☆p*(s0))∥p(s0)☆q(t)∥2=p(s)☆p*(s0)∥p(s0)∥2.Therefore,p^(s,t)=p^(s)∈R[s]4. Moreover, by Eq. (20),p^(s)is a non-zero constant quaternion multiple of p(s), sogcd(p^(s))=gcd(p(s))=1.(⇐) Ifgcd(S(s0,t))=1, then letp^(s,t)=S(s,t)☆S*(s0,t)∥S(s0,t)∥2. It follows from Eq. (4) thatp^(s,t)☆S(s0,t)=S(s,t)☆S*(s0,t)∥S(s0,t)∥2☆S(s0,t)=S(s,t).By assumptionp^(s,t)=p^(s)∈R[s]4andgcd(p^(s))=1, so there exist two rational space curvesp^(s,t)=p^(s)andq^(t)=S(s0,t)such thatp^(s)☆q^(t)=S(s,t),andgcd(p^(s))=gcd(q^(t))=1. □Consider the real rational surfaceS(s,t)=(t2−1−st2+2s−st,t2s2+t2−s2−1+st+s,−2−st+st2−s2t−s2,2t−st−s+s2t−s2).Lets=0. ThenS(0,t)=(t2−1,t2−1,−2,2t),andgcd(S(0,t))=1. Computep^(s)=S(s,t)☆S*(0,t)∥S(0,t)∥2=12(2−s+s2,(1+s)s,s,s).It is easy to verify thatp^(s)∈R[s]4andgcd(p^(s))=1. Setq^(t)=S(0,t). ThenS(s,t)=p^(s)☆q^(t).Thus, the real rational surface S(s, t) is a quaternion rational surface.Consider the real rational surfaceS(s,t)=(1−t+s2,s2−1,s+t,t−1+s2).Lets=1. ThenS(1,t)=(2−t,0,t+1,t).Sincegcd(S(1,t))=1, we computep^(s,t)=S(s,t)☆S*(0,t)∥S(0,t)∥2=15−2t+3t2(2−3t+3t2+2s2+st+s,3s2−3+t−st,−1−s2+2s+t−st,3t−3s2t−1+s2).Sincep^(s,t)0.25em0ex∉0.25em0exR[s]4, it follows that the real rational surface S(s, t) is not a quaternion rational surface.
