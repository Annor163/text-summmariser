@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Clinical text, such as clinical trial eligibility criteria, is largely underused in state-of-the-art medical search engines due to difficulties of accurate parsing. This paper proposes a novel methodology to derive a semantic index for clinical eligibility documents based on a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags, which are automatically mined from the text. We applied this method to eligibility criteria on ClinicalTrials.gov and report that frequent tags (1) define an effective and efficient index of clinical trials and (2) are unlikely to grow radically when the repository increases. We proposed to apply the semantic index to filter clinical trial search results and we concluded that frequent tags reduce the result space more efficiently than an uncontrolled set of UMLS concepts. Overall, unsupervised mining of frequent tags from clinical text leads to an effective semantic index for the clinical eligibility documents and promotes their computational reuse.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Parsing clinical eligibility text is important to leverage the reuse of clinical information for automatic decision support [1,2]. Following this assumption, various methods and techniques have been recently developed to transform clinical trial protocol text into computable representations that can benefit automated tasks (e.g., classification, clustering, discovery [3–9]). Several efforts specifically focused on clinical trial eligibility criteria, which define the characteristics that a research volunteer must possess to qualify for a clinical trial study. Some of these techniques index eligibility criteria using template-based semantic patterns or formal ontologies (e.g., [10,11]), whereas others extract from the text terms covered by the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) lexicon [12] (e.g., [13]). Nevertheless, eligibility criteria generally remain as free text and underused in modern computational tasks such as search. As an example, ClinicalTrials.gov [14] does not process the eligibility criteria text when ranking trials in response to user queries [15]. A major reason is that a standardized and widely accepted parser for clinical trial eligibility criteria is not yet defined [16,17].The indexing methods proposed in the literature generally parse each clinical trial separately without considering textual similarities among them. This results in an ever-expanding index with high dimensionality and high likelihood of presenting too specific, redundant, or irrelevant concepts for individual documents, which is not amenable for automated processing. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on cross-processing eligibility criteria from multiple studies to mine a finite vocabulary of tags frequently shared by these trials, thus serving as a semantic index for eligibility text.1In this domain, tags are defined as meaningful multi-word semantic concepts automatically extracted from the text, such as, e.g., “breast carcinoma”, “diabetes”, “active malignancy”.1In the information retrieval literature, the problem of document indexing and tagging has been robustly studied in different application scenarios as well as in terms of information theory [18–21]. Tags are generally used in exploratory retrieval, in which users engage in iterative cycles of document refinement and exploration of new information (as opposed to standard free-text retrieval). A controlled vocabulary of tags defines an interpretative layer of semantics over the text and its parsed representation, and generally leads to more effective retrieval than uncontrolled annotations [22]. For example, the use of a controlled vocabulary benefited different text search applications (e.g., [23–26]) as well as multimedia retrieval (e.g., [27,28]).We hypothesize that (1) an unsupervised, fully automated data mining approach applied to the clinical trial repository can produce a finite set of tags that is frequently shared among all trials and (2) these frequent tags can lead to a general and stable index of eligibility text, which can leverage the automated processing of clinical trials. This method is potentially superior to other approaches by balancing and minimizing the sparseness of the index and increasing efficiency and specificity of retrieval operations [29]. Moreover, because of their high frequency, tags extracted from the text are likely to be more generic and intuitive than independent annotations, and therefore might be also more effective in helping users with interactive tasks [30].The original contribution of this article is three-fold: we (1) present a novel method for mining a controlled vocabulary of frequent tags from clinical eligibility text; (2) apply this method to ClinicalTrials.gov and report statistics on tag distributions; and (3) propose to evaluate the effectiveness of frequent tags at filtering clinical trial search results when there is no gold standard available for comparing these tags against.
