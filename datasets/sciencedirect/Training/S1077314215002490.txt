@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Multicuts enable to conveniently represent discrete graphical models for unsupervised and supervised image segmentation, in the case of local energy functions that exhibit symmetries. The basic Potts model and natural extensions thereof to higher-order models provide a prominent class of such objectives, that cover a broad range of segmentation problems relevant to image analysis and computer vision. We exhibit a way to systematically take into account such higher-order terms for computational inference. Furthermore, we present results of a comprehensive and competitive numerical evaluation of a variety of dedicated cutting-plane algorithms. Our approach enables the globally optimal evaluation of a significant subset of these models, without compromising runtime. Polynomially solvable relaxations are studied as well, along with advanced rounding schemes for post-processing.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The segmentation problem, also known as partitioning, clustering, or grouping, is a fundamental problem of image analysis. Applications include unsupervised image partitioning [1,2], task-specific image partitioning [3], semantic image segmentation [4,5], and modularity clustering in network analysis [6].Common problem representations are based on a graphG=(V,E),where nodes V relate to raw data on an image grid or extracted feature vectors, and edges E define a neighborhood structure of the nodes. A segmentation of a graph can be represented either by(i)assigning to each node v ∈ V a label, or bya multicut given by a subset of cut edges E′ ⊆ E, resulting in a partition of the set of nodes V.The segmentation problem is then to find a segmentation (node labeling or multicut) with minimal costs.One commonly distinguishes supervised and unsupervised segmentation. In the former case, the number of classes represented by labels is known, together with a function measuring how likely features associated with nodes belong to each class. In the latter unsupervised case, such information is absent. This introduces ambiguities of the representation (i) since permuting the labels results in the same segmentation. Representation (ii) does not exhibit such symmetries and is therefore particularly appealing in the unsupervised case.Accordingly, this paper focuses on the segmentation problem as a multicut problem, on the polyhedral representation of valid multicuts resulting in partitions of a given image [7–9], and on a computational approach to take into account the corresponding constraints efficiently.Specifically, we consider objective functions for the segmentation problem of the formJ(x)=∑fφf(xne(f))– see Section 2 for details – where all higher-order terms, i.e. terms depending on more than one variable, are invariant to label permutations. For second-order models this is equivalent to Potts models that may involve negative couplings between adjacent nodes. While cutting-plane based methods [10] have shown best performance on second-order Potts models with arbitrary couplings [11], we show that terms with order higher than two can be handled by additional auxiliary variables and few additional constraints that do not interfere with the constraints defining valid multicuts. Consequently, cutting-plane methods can be uniformly used for all models as we demonstrate by comprehensive numerical evaluations.In this connection, the present paper provides a systematic comparison of different separation strategies for computer vision applications. In particular, we find that (i) odd-wheel inequalities do not tighten the relaxation as expected, in view of results for highly connected non-computer vision models [12], (ii) integer linear programming subroutines work overall best, but (iii) novel extensions for separation procedures as suggested in this paper are indispensable for efficient usage.Taking these aspects into account improves runtime by at least a factor of 2.We also consider the supervised segmentation problem, i.e. finding an optimal multicut with at most k labels, which is known as the multiway cut problem. Compared to the standard (I)LP representation of such problems our approach is considerably more memory efficient and able to provide globally optimal solutions for many computer vision problems in reasonable runtime [5,11,13]. Fig. 1provides an overview and illustrations of the models studied in this paper.
