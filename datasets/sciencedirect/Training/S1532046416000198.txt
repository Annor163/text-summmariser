ObjectivesToday, hospitals and other health care-related institutions are accumulating a growing bulk of real world clinical data. Such data offer new possibilities for the generation of disease models for the health economic evaluation. In this article, we propose a new approach to leverage cancer registry data for the development of Markov models. Records of breast cancer patients from a clinical cancer registry were used to construct a real world data driven disease model.MethodsWe describe a model generation process which maps database structures to disease state definitions based on medical expert knowledge. Software was programmed in Java to automatically derive a model structure and transition probabilities. We illustrate our method with the reconstruction of a published breast cancer reference model derived primarily from clinical study data. In doing so, we exported longitudinal patient data from a clinical cancer registry covering eight years. The patient cohort (n=892) comprised HER2-positive and HER2-negative women treated with or without Trastuzumab.ResultsThe models generated with this method for the respective patient cohorts were comparable to the reference model in their structure and treatment effects. However, our computed disease models reflect a more detailed picture of the transition probabilities, especially for disease free survival and recurrence.ConclusionsOur work presents an approach to extract Markov models semi-automatically using real world data from a clinical cancer registry. Health care decision makers may benefit from more realistic disease models to improve health care-related planning and actions based on their own data.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Breast cancer is the most leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. More than one million patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year [1]. In the last decades, targeted therapies for HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive cancer were developed to improve the prognosis for these patients. HER2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cells as found in breast tissue. Overexpression of the HER2 protein or amplification on the HER2 gene occurs in about 15–25% of all breast cancer cases [2]. Both indicate aggressive growth and spreading of the tumor. Several health economics evaluations assessed the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of HER2-positive women [3–6].In health economics, disease models (DM) are widely used to conduct evaluations of new treatment plans, medications or prevention programs [7]. Health care facilities use an increasing number of information systems to document the treatment of patients. However, these systems also collect data for “such activities as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification or accreditation, marketing, and other business applications, including strictly commercial activities” [8]. This approach is referred to as secondary use of data, i.e., data are re-used in a different context. It is general consensus that such clinical data have “significant potential to facilitate research, improve quality of care for individuals and populations, and reduce healthcare costs” [9]. Before secondary use can tap its full potential issues like data stewardship principles, reduction and elimination of data silos and guaranteed patient privacy must be addressed [9].Several US [10] and European [11] research initiatives also from scientific societies such as ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) focus on the usage of “real world data” for comparative effectiveness research and health services research [12,13]. These initiatives demand for real world data to assess the impact of new medical interventions in routine care settings. Especially in disease modeling, an increased usage of real world data could bridge the gap between efficacy and effectiveness, i.e., the relation of cost to (added) value under routine conditions [14].This article presents a 4-step model generation process (Definition – Selection – Transformation – Generation) to derive a Markov model from a cancer registry in a semi-automatic manner. We illustrate our approach in a validation study by re-constructing a previously published DM by Blank et al. [3] with data from routine care.We demonstrate how inclusion and exclusion criteria from the randomized Herceptin Adjuvant Trial (HERA) are used to select a suitable cohort of patients [15]. Moreover, definitions of disease states are mapped to database tables from a tumor documentation system. To assess differences between the results obtained from real world data and data collected under optimal conditions of a randomized clinical trial (RCT), transition probabilities of the computed model are compared with probabilities derived from a breast cancer RCT.
