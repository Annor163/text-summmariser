@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The limitations of manual sleep scoring make computerized methods highly desirable. Scoring errors can arise from human rater uncertainty or inter-rater variability. Sleep scoring algorithms either come as supervised classifiers that need scored samples of each state to be trained, or as unsupervised classifiers that use heuristics or structural clues in unscored data to define states. We propose a quasi-supervised classifier that models observations in an unsupervised manner but mimics a human rater wherever training scores are available. EEG, EMG, and EOG features were extracted in 30s epochs from human-scored polysomnograms recorded from 42 healthy human subjects (18–79 years) and archived in an anonymized, publicly accessible database. Hypnograms were modified so that: 1. Some states are scored but not others; 2. Samples of all states are scored but not for transitional epochs; and 3. Two raters with 67% agreement are simulated. A framework for quasi-supervised classification was devised in which unsupervised statistical models—specifically Gaussian mixtures and hidden Markov models—are estimated from unlabeled training data, but the training samples are augmented with variables whose values depend on available scores. Classifiers were fitted to signal features incorporating partial scores, and used to predict scores for complete recordings. Performance was assessed using Cohen׳sΚstatistic. The quasi-supervised classifier performed significantly better than an unsupervised model and sometimes as well as a completely supervised model despite receiving only partial scores. The quasi-supervised algorithm addresses the need for classifiers that mimic scoring patterns of human raters while compensating for their limitations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Sleep is increasingly the subject of debate in the context of public health [1,2]. Disorders of sleep [3] are not only unique in the spectrum of illnesses but also accompany and complicate the management of other serious neurological conditions such as epilepsy [4], Parkinson׳s [5] and Alzheimer׳s disease [6]. Human sleep has been dissected broadly into five distinct states of vigilance: Wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement or REM sleep (R), and non-REM sleep (N) with stages N1, N2, and N3 that reflect increasing sleep depth. Sleep analysis typically involves overnight monitoring in a sleep lab resulting in a polysomnogram: i.e., a suite of continuous measurements that may include an electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electrocardiogram (EKG), among other physiologically derived signals. The polysomnogram is inspected by a human expert, who labels the predominant vigilance state in sequential epochs, each typically 30s in duration, for the entire recording. Despite the adoption of detailed guidelines [7] for labeling each vigilance state by practitioners of sleep medicine, and continuing efforts to automate the process, scoring sleep in polysomnographic recordings remains a tedious and subjective exercise. Even expert raters can be uncertain about the presentation of certain vigilance states and may vary widely in their assessment of specific recordings [8].Computational tools that segment sleep either look for intrinsic patterns in the data [9–11] to define the predominant vigilance states or model a human rater׳s scoring of sample data and try to mimic her performance when applied to future recordings [12,13]. These contrasting approaches, referred to as unsupervised and supervised classification respectively, are mutually exclusive; moreover, they do not explicitly address issues of rater uncertainty and disagreement. Here we propose a simple modification to the way classifiers are applied to sleep data to address three specific scenarios:1.A human rater is more certain about the symptoms of some vigilance states than others;A rater labels all the states, but only in samples where the evidence is unambiguous; andOne classifier needs to mimic a panel of raters with some variance in their scoring patterns.In our algorithmic solution to these distinct but related problems, a set of features computed from each epoch of the polysomnogram is augmented, or tagged, with a vector variable whose value depends on the available score(s). This sequence of score-augmented input variables is used to train an unsupervised classifier—Gaussian mixture models (GMMs [14]) and hidden Markov models (HMMs [15]) are used here as illustrative examples—to map the continuous-valued features onto discrete vigilance states. Minor variations on this theme are used to address each of the scoring scenarios identified above and the performance of the classifier compared with appropriate reference methods.
