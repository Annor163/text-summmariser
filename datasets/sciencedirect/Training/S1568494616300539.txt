@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) contains much more comprehensive information than the traditional multiplicative preference relations. The HMPR is a useful tool to help the decision makers express their preferences in group decision making under uncertainty. The key of group decision making with the HMPR is to derive the priority weights from the HMPR. Thus, an efficient and practical priority method should be put forward so as to ensure the reasonability of the final decision result. In order to do that, in this paper, we first introduce the expected value and the geometric average value of hesitant multiplicative element (HME) which is the component of the HMPR. Then from different perspectives, we utilize the error-analysis technique to put forward three novel methods for the priorities of the HMPR, i.e., the expectation value method, the geometric average value method, and the multiplicative deviation method. We also investigate the relationships among these methods, and develop an approach to group decision making with the HMPR by using the methods and the possibility degree formula. Finally, by constructing the indicator system for credit risk evaluation of supply chain enterprises, we make a detailed case study concerning Lu-Zhou-Lao-Jiao (the well-known liquor enterprise in China) to demonstrate our approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to the limitation of the decision maker's cognition, the preference relations have been widely used to describe the decision maker's preferences in the decision making process. In 1977, Saaty introduced the multiplicative preference relations (MPRs), which are the basic components in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [1] and the analytic network process (ANP) [2]. Each element of a MPR is the preference value expressed by the decision maker over each pair of the alternatives according to the 1–9 scale [1]. Especially, if the decision maker prefers an alternative to another absolutely, then his/her preference can be expressed by the number 9; Conversely, it is expressed as the number 1/9.In the complex decision making environment, when the decision makers are asked to provide their preferences by comparing pairs of alternatives, they may be uncertain and thus provide the insufficient preference information. Therefore, the traditional multiplicative preference relations have been extended into interval multiplicative preference relations [3], intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations [4], and linguistic multiplicative preference relations [5,6], which can help the decision makers express their uncertain preferences. For all kinds of multiplicative preference relations, the priority weight vectors are the final results, which can help the decision makers select the best alternative. Consequently, a lot of priority methods have been developed for MPRs, such as the eigenvector method [1], the goal programming methods [7,8], the least-squares method [9] and the logarithmic least-squares method [10], etc. In practical situations, the priority methods had better be simple and convenient so that the decision makers can get the decision results as quickly as they can. In such cases, Xu [11] introduced an error-analysis-based method for intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation, which needs less computation in actual applications.However, in group decision making, the preferences of the decision makers are usually different or a decision maker cannot decide which one to choose among some preference values. Traditional multiplicative preference relation and its extensions express the decision group's preferences by presenting the preference relation of each decision maker. It is difficult to analyze the decision group's preference information about each pair of alternatives. In order to integrate the group preference information, Xia and Xu [12] introduced the hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR), in which the preference information provided by the decision makers through comparing a pair of alternatives is denoted by a hesitant multiplicative element (HME). For example, a group of decision makers discuss the degree to which an alternative is superior to another. Some of them provide 1/3, some provide 3, and the others provide 5. The decision makers’ experiences and cognitions are different and none of them can be ignored, and thus, the preference information provided by the decision makers can be expressed as a HME {1/3, 3, 5}. In this situation, Zhu and Xu [13] extended the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to the hesitant AHP, and developed a hesitant multiplicative programming method (HMPM) as a new priority method to derive the ratio-scale priorities from HMPRs. Based on α-normalization and β-normalization, Zhang and Wu [23] developed a goal programming model and a convex combination method to derive the priority weights from HMPRs. Considering the twofold group decision making problem, Pérez-Fernández et al. [24] investigated the application of finite interval-valued hesitant fuzzy preference relations. Yu et al. [25] proposed two generalized hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators, and applied them to develop a procedure for group decision making.However, the HMPRs contain all the information provided by the decision makers, and thus, these methods for group decision making based on the HMPRs are time-consuming and complex to obtain the priority weights. Moreover, because the information provided by the decision makers is important and none of the decision makers can be ignored, it is necessary to cover preference information as much as possible. The error-analysis technique can make the calculation process much easier and cover more information, which helps us obtain the decision results conveniently and precisely. The novelty of this paper is that it combines the error-analysis technique and the HMPR to support the group decision making process, which needs to cover all the hesitant information in a simple and convenient way. In this paper, we define the expected value and the geometric average value of the HME respectively. Then from different perspectives, we utilize the error-analysis technique to come up with three novel methods for the priorities of the HMPR, i.e., the expected value method, the geometric average value method, and the multiplicative deviation method, which can process hesitant information sufficiently. The methods have their own advantages and scopes of applications, so the decision makers can choose one of these methods according to different situations. Based on the proposed methods, we develop an error-analysis-based approach for group decision making.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some basic concepts related to HME, HMPR and error analysis. In Section 3, we define the concepts of the expected value and the geometric average value of a HME respectively, and apply them as well as the error propagation formula to develop three priority methods for the HMPR. Then, we discuss the relationships among these methods, and develop an approach to group decision making with the HMPR by combining the possibility degree formula. In Section 4, we illustrate our approach with a credit risk evaluation problem of supply chain enterprises. The paper ends with some concluding remarks in Section 5.In what follows, we review some concepts and theorems related to the HMPR, which will be used in the next sections.In group decision making, the opinions of the decision makers are usually different from each other and none of them can be ignored. Thus, hesitant fuzzy sets have been introduced to deal with this issue. Torra [14] first defined the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets as follows:Definition 1[14]. Let X be a fixed set, a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0, 1].Based on the 1–9 scale [15], Zhu and Xu [13] introduced the hesitant multiplicative set (HMS):Definition 2[13]. Let X be a fixed set, a HMS is defined as:For convenience, z=z(x) can be called a hesitant multiplicative element (HME). Since a HME may consist of several possible values, it can be considered as a hesitant judgment in the decision making environment. Based on the HMEs, in the following subsection, we will introduce the hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR).Preference relations are a common tool to express the decision makers’ preferences in the decision making problems. Among them, the multiplicative preference relation is the most widely used representation format, which was originally introduced by Saaty [1].In order to represent the decision makers’ preferences, the 1–9 scale [15] was constructed to describe the comparison relationships between two alternatives, as shown in Table 1.Then, a multiplicative preference relation can be defined as follows:Definition 3[15]. A multiplicative preference relation H on the set X is defined as a reciprocal matrix H=(hij)n×n∈X×X under the conditions:In particular, hij=1 implies indifference between the alternatives xiand xj; hij>1 indicates that the alternative xiis preferred to the alternative xj, the greater hij, the stronger the preference intensity of the alternative xiover xj; hij<1 means that the alternative xjis preferred to the alternative xi, the smaller hij, the greater the preference intensity of the alternative xjover xi.To express the different preferences of the decision makers in the group decision making process, Xia and Xu [12] defined the hesitant multiplicative preference relation by combining the HFS and the MPR, shown as follows:Definition 4[12]. A hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) H on the set A={A1, A2, …, An} is presented by a matrixH=(hij)n×n⊂A×A, wherehij={hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}is a hesitant multiplicative element (HME) which indicates that all the possible degrees to which Aiis preferred to Aj. Moreover, hijshould satisfy:Xu [16] also defined the score of HME, which can be used to compare the relationship between two HMEs:Definition 5[16]. For a HME e,s(e)=∏η∈eη1/leis called the score of e, where leis the number of the elements in e. For two HMEs e1 and e2, if s(e1)>s(e2), then e1>e2.Suppose that a random function z=f(y1, y2, …, yn), yi∈Y, where Y=(y1, y2, …, yn) is a set of random variables. Ifσyi2is the random error of the variable yi, and ρijis a correlation coefficient, then the random error of z is [17]:(4)σz2=∑i=1n∂f∂yi2σyi2+2∑i=1n∂f∂yi∂f∂yjρijσiσjEspecially, if the random errors of the variables yi(i=1, 2, …, n) are mutually independent (in this case, ρij=0, for all i, j=1, 2, …, n), then it follows from (4) that(5)σz2=∑i=1n∂f∂yi2σyi2If we replace the standard random errorsσyi(i=1,2,…,n)by the error ranges Δyi(i=1, 2, …, n), then (5) is transformed into the famous error propagation formula:(6)(Δz)2=∑i=1n∂f∂yi2(Δyi)2In the process of group decision making, the decision makers provide different preference values for pairs of alternatives. In order to evaluate the alternatives comprehensively, we define the expected value and the geometric average value of the HME respectively, which can represent the general information of the HME to some degree:Definition 6Let H=(hij)n×nbe a HMPR, wherehij={hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}, i, j=1, 2, …, n. Thenh¯ij=hij−⋅hij+is called the expected value of the HME hij, wherehij−=min{hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}andhij+=max{hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}.Let H=(hij)n×nbe a HMPR, wherehij={hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}, i, j=1, 2, …, n. Supposeh¯¯ij=hij1×hij2…×hijlhijlhij, then it is called the geometric average value of the HME hij.We find that the matrices constructed by the expected values and the geometric average values of the HMEs have some specific features as shown below:Theorem 1LetH¯=(h¯ij)n×n, whereh¯ijis the expected value of the HME hij, thenH¯=(h¯ij)n×nis a multiplicative preference relation (MPR).Since1/9≤hijt≤9,t=1,2,…,lhij, then we haveh¯ij=hij−hij+≤9×9=9,h¯ij=hij−hij+≥19×19=19According to the definition of HMPR, the HME hijsatisfies:(7)hijthijlhji−t+1=1,hii={1},lhij=lhji,i,j=1,2,…,nand thus,h¯ijh¯ji=hij−hij+⋅hji−hji+=hij−hij+1hij+1hij=1,h¯ii=1×1=1SoH¯=(h¯ij)n×nis a MPR. □LetH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×n, whereh¯¯ijis the geometric average value of the HME hij, thenH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×nis a MPR.Since1/9≤hijt≤9,t=1,2,…,lhij, then we can know that(8)h¯¯ij=hij1hij2…hijlhijlhij≥19×19×…×19lhij=19,h¯¯ij=hij1hij2…hijlhijlhij≤9×9×…×9lhij=9and the HME hijof the MPRH¯¯satisfies:(9)hijthjilhji−t+1=1,hii={1},lhij=lhji,i,j=1,2,…,nThus, we can easily get(10)h¯¯ij⋅h¯¯ji=hij1hij2…hijlhijlhijhji1hji2…hjilhjilhji=hij1hij2…hijlhijlhij1hijlhijhijlhij−1…hij1lhij=1,h¯¯ii=1×1=1Therefore,H¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×nis a MPR. □Suppose that H is a HMPR:By Definitions 6 and 7, we can easily getH¯=(h¯ij)n×nandH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×n, whereH¯=11231113211H¯¯=11.71000.87360.584810.69341.14471.44221from which we know that the expected values of h12={1/7, 5, 7} and h23={1/9, 1/3, 9} are the same, even the HMEs h12 and h23 are quite different, this is because that the expected values of the HMEs produce the loss of some information in the HMEs. However, the geometric average valuesh¯¯12=1.7100andh¯¯23=0.6934are different since they contain all the information of h12 and h23. Moreover, the preference values of the HME h23 are in the interval [0, 1] excepth23(3)=9, from which we can conclude that a majority of the decision makers prefer the third alternative to the second one. But we can see from the results that the expected valueh¯23is 1 and the geometric average valueh¯¯23is 0.6934. So the latter conforms to the real situation, and thus, the geometric average values are closer to the preferences of the decision group.According to Definition 6, we have known that the expected value of hijcan be calculated byh¯ij=hij−⋅hij+, wherehij−=min{hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}andhij+=max{hijt|t=1,2,…,lhij}. Then we applyh¯ij=hij−⋅hij+to construct the MPRH¯=(h¯ij)n×n.Up to now, many methods have been developed for deriving the priority weight vector of a MPR, such as the eigenvector method [1], the goal programming models [7,8], the least-squares method (LSM) [9] and the logarithmic least-squares method (LLSM) [10]. The LLSM employs a simple geometric mean to get the priority weights from the MPR, so we can use the LLSM to derive the priority weight vector of the MPRH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×nas follows:(11)ω¯i(1)=∏j=1nh¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n=∏j=1nhij−hij+1n∑l=1n∏j=1nhlj−hlj+1nThe expected value represents the general information of a HME. However, we can see from Example 1 that the HMEs are different while their expected values are the same. To further depict the information of HMEs, in the following, we introduce the error rangesΔδijr(1)andΔδijl(1)to express the distance between the upper limithij+and the expected valueh¯ijof the HME hij, and the distance between the expected valueh¯ijand the lower limithij−of the HME hij, respectively:(12)Δδijr(1)=hij+−h¯ij=hij+−hij−hij+(13)Δδijl(1)=h¯ij−hij−=hij−hij+−hij−By the formula (6), we can obtain the propagation error:(14)(Δω¯il(1))2=∑j=1n∂ω¯i∂h¯ij2(Δδijl(1))2=∑j=1nΔδijl(1)h¯ij2⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯ij1n2∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯lj)1n4(15)(Δω¯ir(1))2=∑j=1n∂ω¯i∂h¯ij2(Δδijr(1))2=∑j=1nΔδijr(1)h¯ij2⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯ij1n2∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯lj)1n4Based on the propagation error, we obtain the left and right weight error vectorsΔωl(1)=(Δω1l(1),Δω2l(1),…,Δωnl(1))andΔωr(1)=(Δω1r(1),Δω2r(1),…,Δωnr(1))respectively, where(16)Δω¯il(1)=∑j=1nΔδijl(1)h¯ij212⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯lj)1n2(17)Δω¯ir(1)=∑j=1nΔδijr(1)h¯ij212⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯lj)1n2From the priority weight vector and the left and right weight error vectors above, we obtain the weight vector of the HMPR H=(hij)n×n, which can reflect the ranges of weights of the alternatives:(18)ω˜i(1)=[max{ω¯i(1)−Δω¯il(1),0},min{ω¯i(1)+Δω¯ir(1),1}]We have known that the geometric average valueh¯¯ijcontains all the information of the HME hij, whereh¯¯ij=hij1×hij2…×hijlhijlhij. To make the decision result more accurate, in the following, we will develop a method to obtain the priority weight vector of a HMPR:We first construct a MPRH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×nby all the geometric average values of the HMPR H=(hij)n×n. By applying the LLSM, the priority weight vector of the MPRH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×nisω¯(2)=(ω¯1(2),ω¯2(2),…,ω¯n(2)),where(19)ω¯i(2)=∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯¯lj1n=∏j=1nhij1×hij2×…×hijlhijlhij1n∑l=1n∏j=1nhlj1×hlj2×…×hljlhijlhlj1nTo further describe the information of a HME hij, we need to calculate the error value δij, which is measured by the distance between the upper limithij+and the expected valueh¯¯ijof the HME hij, and the distance between the expected valueh¯¯ijand the lower limithij−of the HME hijrespectively:(20)δijl(2)=h¯¯ij−hij−=hij1×hij2…×hijlhijlhij−hij−(21)δijr(2)=hij+−h¯¯ij=hij+−hij1×hij2…×hijlhijlhijIn order to get the left and right weight error vectorsΔωl(2)=(Δω1l(2),Δω2l(2),…,Δωnl(2))andΔωr(2)=(Δω1r(2),Δω2r(2),…,Δωnr(2))respectively, we use the formula (6) to obtain the propagation errors:(22)(Δω¯il(2))2=∑j=1n∂ω¯i∂h¯ij2(Δδijl(2))2=∑j=1nΔδijl(2)h¯¯ij2⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n2∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯¯lj)1n4(23)(Δω¯ir(2))2=∑j=1n∂ω¯i∂h¯ij2(Δδijr(2))2=∑j=1nΔδijr(2)h¯ij2⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n2∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯¯lj)1n4and then determine the left and right weight error vectors by using:(24)Δω¯il(2)=∑j=1nΔδijl(2)h¯¯ij212⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯¯lj)1n2(25)Δω¯ir(2)=∑j=1nΔδijr(2)h¯¯ij212⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯¯lj)1n2Combining the left and right weight error vectors and the priority weight vector of the MPRH¯¯=(h¯¯ij)n×n, we can get the weight intervals of the HMPR H=(hij)n×n:(26)ω˜i(2)=[max{ω¯i(2)−Δω¯il(2),0},min{ω¯i(2)+Δω¯ir(2),1}]From Definition 6 and Method 1, we have found thath¯ij=hij−⋅hij+,Δδij(r)=hij+−h¯ij=hij+−hij−hij+andΔδij(l)=h¯ij−hij−=hij−hij+−hij−. Since the information of the expected valueh¯ijis incomplete and the error valuesΔδijr(1)andΔδijl(1)are relatively large, then there may exist some deviations in the results. To overcome this issue, we obtain the error matrixδ(3)=(δij(3))n×nby combining the expected value and the geometric average value, where(27)δij(3)=|h¯ij−h¯¯ij|=|hij−⋅hij+−hij1×hij2…×hijlhijlhij|From Method 1, we know that(28)ω¯i(3)=∏j=1nh¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n=∏j=1nhij−hij+1n∑l=1n∏j=1nhlj−hlj+1nand then, the weight error vectorΔω¯(3)=(Δω¯1(3),Δω¯2(3),…,Δω¯n(3))can be easily obtained, where(29)Δω¯il(3)=Δω¯ir(3)=Δω¯ir(3)=∑j=1nΔδijr(3)h¯ij212⋅∑l=1n∏j=1nh¯lj1n+∏j=1nh¯ij1n1n∏j=1nh¯ij1n∑l=1n∏j=1n(h¯lj)1n2Therefore, we get the weight intervals of a HMPR by combiningω¯iandΔω¯i:(30)ω˜i3=[max{ω¯i3−Δω¯i3,0},min{ω¯i+Δω¯i3,1}]Example 2Suppose that the MPRsH¯andH¯¯are derived from Example 1. Then by using Methods 1–3, we get the priority weights and the error value matrices, as shown in Tables 2–3from which we can easily obtain the left and right weight error vectors and the weight intervals (see Table 4).
