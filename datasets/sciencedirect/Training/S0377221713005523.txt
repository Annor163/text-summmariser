@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The ship placement problem constitutes a daily challenge for planners in tide river harbours. In essence, it entails positioning a set of ships into as few lock chambers as possible while satisfying a number of general and specific placement constraints. These constraints make the ship placement problem different from traditional 2D bin packing. A mathematical formulation for the problem is presented. In addition, a decomposition model is developed which allows for computing optimal solutions in a reasonable time. A multi-order best fit heuristic for the ship placement problem is introduced, and its performance is compared with that of the left-right-left-back heuristic. Experiments on simulated and real-life instances show that the multi-order best fit heuristic beats the other heuristics by a landslide, while maintaining comparable calculation times. Finally, the new heuristic’s optimality gap is small, while it clearly outperforms the exact approach with respect to calculation time.set of ships that need to be placed, N={1,2,…,n}set of lockages (bins) available, M={1,2,…,m}, where m should be a sufficiently large number, e.g. m=n or equal to an appropriate upper boundset of ships to which ship i∈N is allowed to moorwidth and length of the chamber (integer)width and length of ship i∈N (integer)minimal distance between ship i∈N and the front/back of the chamberminimal safety distance between ships i∈N and j∈N when they are adjacent, or laying behind each otherrepresents the left quay of the chamber: x0=0, y0=0, w0=0, l0=Lrepresents the right quay of the chamber: xn+1=W, yn+1=0, wn+1=0, ln+1=Lrelative cost of the number of lockagesinteger variables that define the x and y position of ship i∈N in the chamber (lower left corner of ship)binary variable that indicates if ship i∈N is left to ship j∈N (leftij=1⇒xi+wi⩽xj)binary variable that indicates if ship i∈N is behind ship j∈N (bij=1⇒yi+li⩽yj)binary variables that indicate if ship i∈N is moored to ship j∈N’s left, respectively right, sidebinary variable that indicates whether lockage k∈M is used or notbinary variable that indicates whether ship i∈N is processed in lockage k∈M or notbinary variable, 0 when ship i∈N and j∈N are processed in the same lockage, 1 otherwise

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
When entering or leaving a port, ships often pass one or more locks. So do barges travelling on a network of waterways. The locks provide a constant water level for ships while loading or unloading at the docks, or they control the flow and the level of inland waterways.The growing number of container shipments causes high demands on sea ports (Wiese, Suhl, & Kliewer, 2010). Improving the ship handling can reduce their time in port and make a seaport economically more attractive, engendering a strong competition between (geographically close) seaports (Bish, 2003; Chen, Bostel, Dejax, Cai, & Xi, 2006; Cullinane & Khanna, 2000; Günther & Kim, 2006). While many aspects of handling ships and containers in seaports have been extensively researched (Stahlbock & Voß, 2008), one key component of the port’s infrastructure has received little attention: the locks. A suboptimal usage of the locks’ capacity can however strongly increase the handling times of ships. When the lock is unable to transfer a given ship in time, this ship could miss its time window at the terminal, leading to a strong increase in total time in port and a reduced efficiency of the terminal. Improved operation of these locks can therefore play an important role in increasing a port’s efficiency and economical attractiveness.The expected increase of intermodal transport is a major incentive for improving lock efficiency on inland waterways (European Commission, 2009, 2011). Intermodal transport is the combination of multiple transport modes in a single transport chain without a change of container for the goods. Inland navigation is a most promising transport mode in the intermodal chain, with its availability of access capacity in the network and environmentally friendly character as most important benefits. This is especially true in the Belgian and Western-European context, where inland waterways play a crucial role in the hinterland access of major sea ports (Notteboom & Rodrigue, 2005). Increasing the efficiency of (intermodal) barge transport through better lock operations is therefore a key issue in supporting future freight flows and increasing the market share of inland navigation.
