@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Consensus reaching models are widely applied in group decision making problems to improve the group's consensus level before making a common decision. Within the context of the group Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a novel consensus reaching model in a dynamic decision environment is proposed. A Markov chain method can be used to determine the decision makers’ weights of importance for the aggregation process with respect to the group members’ opinion transition probabilities. The proposed group consensus reaching model facilitates a peer to peer opinion exchange process which relieves the group of the need for a moderator by using an automatic feedback mechanism. Moreover, as the elements in the group decision framework change in a dynamic decision making problem, this model provides feedback suggestions that adaptively adjust for each of the decision makers depending on his credibility in each round. The full process of the dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model is presented and its properties are discussed. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The complexity of the decisions that management face makes it difficult to depend on a single decision maker's knowledge and capabilities to obtain a meaningful and reliable solution. Therefore, group decision making has received significant attention in both the research and in practice. Group decision making (GDM) is a procedure that combines the individuals’ judgments into a common opinion on behalf of a whole group. To express the judgments of individuals, several formats are usually used in GDM, such as fuzzy preference relations (Cabrerizo, Moreno, Perez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010; Tanino, 1984; Xu, 2009; Xu, Li, & Wang, 2013), linguistic preference relations (Alonso, Pérez, Cabrerizo, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1995; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & verdegay, 1996; Wu & Xu, 2012a), utility functions (Brock, 1980; Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2012; Huang, Chang, Li, & Lin, 2013; Keeney & Kirkwood, 1975) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jimenez, & Salvador, 2010; Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 2001; Dyer & Forman, 1992; Van Den Honert & Lootsma, 1997).The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a comprehensive tool developed by Saaty (1977) for constructing decision models and establishing the decision priorities with respect to a finite set of alternatives, has been widely applied to group decisions because of the flexible structure and our innate ability to make relative comparisons. Allocating the weight or importance to each individual within a group is an important component in the decision process and plays a key role in obtaining the final solution in an AHP model. In the past three decades multiple methods have been proposed to determine the weights of individuals (Bolloju, 2001; Forman & Peniwati, 1998; Ramanathan & Ganesh, 1994; Saaty, 1994a; Van den Honert, 2001). However, these methods suffer from several drawbacks. First, most of these methods assign the weights according to subjective judgments. Thus at least one individual must serve as a judge of the judges to provide this subjective weighting for the preferences of the decision makers. In practice, this potential for bias is a significant obstacle to overcome. Furthermore, it could be more reasonable to assign the weights of importance to each decision maker according to how compatible their judgments are with those of others (Xu & Cai, 2011; Xu et al., 2013). Therefore we develop a dynamic method using the opinion transition probabilities, which serve as a way to measure the compatibility between decision makers, to allocate the weights to the decision makers in place of needing a judge.As there is always a diversity of opinion in a group, reaching a certain level of consensus is a critical step in obtaining a valid solution in real world group decision making problems (Herrera et al., 1996). However, full consensus, which is related to the state of total agreement, is hard to achieve in real world GDM problems. Therefore the concept of soft consensus is employed in GDM problems (Herrera-Viedma, Cabrerizo, Kacprzyk, & Pedrycz, 2014). A consensus reaching process is usually defined as an interactive process with several rounds of improving the incompatible decision maker's consensus level. Numerous approaches have been developed for measuring and improving the consensus based on different preference relations, such as linguistic consensus reaching models (Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000; Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata, & Chiclana, 2005; Mata, Martinez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009), fuzzy consensus reaching models (Cabrerizo, Perez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010; Guha & Chakraborty, 2011; Kacprzyk, Fedrizzi, & Nurmi, 1992; Parreiras, Ekel, Martini, & Palhares, 2010), and evidential reasoning based consensus models (Fu & Yang, 2010, 2011, 2012).Consensus reaching models have also been widely studied in group AHP decision making problems. Using consistency as a control in group decision making, Dong, Zhang, Hong, and Xu (2010) proposed two AHP consensus models based on a row geometric mean prioritization method. Wu and Xu (2012b) developed a consistency and consensus based group AHP decision making model which is independent of the method of prioritization. Gong, Forrest, Zhao, and Yang (2012) proposed a group consensus deviation degree optimization model for the group AHP problems and proved that the consensus degree of decision makers converges as the number of the decision makers increases indefinitely. Xu et al. (2013) presented a distance-based consensus model for group AHP applications, in which the individual to group consensus index and group consensus index are introduced in an iterative algorithm for consensus reaching. However, as pointed out in Section 4, a significant drawback that exists in their consensus reaching models is that they use the aggregated group opinion as the reference point for both measuring an individual's consensus level and revising the incompatible individual's judgments. These centricity-oriented methods require aggregating the individuals’ opinions into a representative group opinion in each round. This step increases the cost and complexity of the GDM problems. Thus a new consensus reaching model without the need for opinion aggregation in each round is desirable to avoid this drawback. Furthermore, in existing consensus reaching models, it is often the case that they behave in a similar way during the whole consensus process even though the elements and conditions of the GDM problem change. Mata et al. (2009) proposed an adaptive consensus reaching model which adapts the number of changes required by the experts according to the consensus level achieved in each round of the consensus reaching process. Chen, Lee, Yang, and Sheu (2012) proposed an adaptive consensus support model which can modify experts’ preferences to improve convergence toward a higher degree of consensus. In a peer to peer consensus reaching model, it is the authors’ belief that how much a decision maker should revise her priorities in each round of the consensus reaching process might be determined by her consensus level or credibility in that round. A new consensus reaching process can address these issues within GDM.Thus we first use a finite state space Markov chain to develop an opinion transition probabilities based weighting method. Then a peer to peer dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model for the group AHP decision problems is proposed. The automatic feedback mechanism of the consensus reaching model will adapt the portion of the decision maker's judgments that are kept and/or revised according to their credibility in a dynamic group consensus reaching process.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 displays some preliminaries related to GDM problems. Section 3 presents the objective weight determining method. Section 4 provides the detailed description of the proposed peer to peer dynamic adaptive consensus model in AHP-group decision making. A numerical example is provided in Section 5. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.For simplicity, we useN={1,2,…,n},M={1,2,…,m}to denote the elements in sets. LetX={x1,x2,…,xn}be a finite set of alternatives, where xidenotes the ith alternative. The judgment information is represented as an n × n pairwise compare matrix (PCM)A=(aij=wi/wj)n×n, whereaij=1/ajiand aijbelongs to Saaty's 1–9 fundamental scale and represents the relative importance or better, dominance of xiover xj. Consistency, defined by Saaty (1980), is a concept defined to describe and reflect the quality of a PCM. The PCMAis perfectly consistent if(1)aij=aikakj,i,j,k∈NHowever, in real life decision situations, consistency is hard to achieve. Saaty (1980) defined the consistency index as(2)CIA=λmax−nn−1where λmax  is the largest or principal eigenvalue ofA. To measure the inconsistency ofA, we use the consistency ratio (Saaty, 1977)(3)CRA=CIARInwhere RInis average random consistency index derived from randomly generated n × n PCMs (see Table 1). In general, if CRAis less than 0.10, we say that PCMAis acceptably consistent (Saaty, 1990).LetD={DM1,DM2,…,DMm}be a set of m decision makers. The judgment of decision maker DMkis expressed by a PCMAk=(aij(k))n×n, for k ∈ M, and letρ=(ρ1,ρ2,…,ρm)Tbe the weight or importance vector of the decision makers, where ρk≥ 0,∑k=1mρk=1, k ∈ M. By aggregating with the weighted geometric mean, the group PCMG=(gij)n×ncan be calculated as(4)gij=∏k=1m(aij(k))ρkOnce the individual judgments are aggregated by the geometric mean into group judgments, we face the following question for the inconsistency of the group PCM. Grošelj and Zadnik Stirn (2012) proved that if each of m PCMsA1,A2,…,Amis of acceptable consistency, thenG(the weighted geometric mean of these PCMs) is also of acceptable consistency.To measure the consensus level in a group, one first measures the closeness or distance of opinions of two decision makers. In the group AHP context, it is necessary to compare the difference, closeness, or distance of two PCMs. Then using these distance measures which are calculated between all pairs of decision makers in a group, we can create an undirected graph to show the relationship of the decision makers. Considering that a PCM belongs to an absolute scale and thus also to a ratio scale, Saaty (1994b) suggested that the closeness of two PCMs can be measured by using the compatibility index.Definition 1(Saaty, 1994b) LetAk=(aij(k))n×nandAl=(aij(l))n×nbe two PCM, the compatibility index ofAkandAlcan be defined as(5)c(Ak,Al)=1n2eTAk∘AlTe=1n2∑i=1n∑j=1naij(k)aji(l)where ○ denotes the Hadamard product of two matrices ande=(1,1,…,1)T. From Eq. (5), we have c(Ak,Al) ≥ 1 andc(Ak,Al)=1if and only ifAk=Al. Then we can define the individual consensus index.Definition 2LetA1,A2,…AmandGbe as before, andAp,Aqbe two PCMs with respect to decision maker DMp, DMq, p, q ∈ M, the individual consensus index (ICI) between DMpand DMqis defined as(6)ICIpq=c(Ap,Aq),p,q∈Mwhere ICIpqdenotes the closeness between the judgments of decision maker DMpand DMqin the group. From Eqs. (5) and (6), we have that the ICI holds: (1) ICIpq≥ 1; (2)ICIpq=ICIqp(symmetry); (3)ICIpp=1(reflexivity).Given a threshold value ɛ, where ɛ ≥ 1, if ICIpq≤ ɛ, we say that decision maker p and q have acceptable consensus amongst each other. The value of ɛ usually depends on the particular problem we are dealing with. Saaty (1994b) suggested that ɛ can be set at 1.1 as a lower consensus level. From long experience with projects we have learned 10% is too large, and hence we suggest that ɛ can be set at 1.01 because 1% deviation is usually used as the upper end of acceptability. When the consequences of the decision are associated to every individual in this group and no one has unique authority, the consensus level should be as high as possible, such as 1.01. At the other extreme, if there is a leader in a group and the decision is made in an autocratic way, or it is urgent to get a solution to the problem, then a lower consensus level such as 1.1 could be required.The individual consensus index can only denote the undirected relation between a pair of decision makers. In other words, we haveICIpq=ICIqp. Suppose we have a pair of individuals {DMk, DMl} in a group, it is necessary to distinguish the adoption directions between these two individuals in the consensus reaching process because DMkand DMlmay make a different choice about the judgment revision. Thus for clarifying the direction between two decision makers, we define the ordered pair of decision makers as follows:Definition 3LetD={DM1,DM2,…,DMm}be a set of m decision makers. An ordered pair of decision makers in the group is defined as (DMk, DMl), k, l ∈ M, where, for example, (DMk, DMl) denotes that DMkmay revise his\her judgments according to DMl.From Definition 3, we get that (DMk, DMl) ≠ (DMl, DMk). Thus with the different ordered pairs of decision makers, the relations between one pair of decision makers can be shown as Fig. 1.The weight or importance of a decision maker is an important and sensitive issue in group decision making. As often is the case, the weight of the decision makers can be obtained through pairwise comparisons or by rating them one at a time. Saaty (1994a) proposed a hierarchy of criteria such as expertise, experience, previous performance, persuasive abilities, effort on the problem, etc. to determine the weight vector of the decision makers, as shown in Fig. 2. This is a natural way to determine the individual weight in a group by using prior information about the decision makers. Ramanathan and Ganesh (1994) provided an eigenvector based method to derive the weight vector of decision makers by using interpersonal comparison among individuals in a group.Forman and Peniwati (1998) noted that in some cases it is difficult to find a knowledgeable person to provide judgments to the hierarchy in Fig. 2. In general, even if one does find such an individual, he may not have the knowledge and information to determine which decision maker is more important. In addition, the decision makers may not know each other very well. Thus, in the absence of prior information, an objective way to determine the weights of the decision makers as shown below is needed.Usually, the objective way to determine decision makers’ weights is to find an appropriate weight vector which can aggregate all the individual judgments into the most representative group judgment. In many instances an optimization program that minimizes the distance between all of the decision makers’ opinions and the aggregated group opinion is used (Xu & Cai, 2011; Xu et al., 2013). However, this optimization programming relies on aggregating the individuals’ opinions into the group's opinion. Here we propose to determine the weights of the decision makers based on their opinion transition probabilities. In a group of decision makers, there is always a diversity of opinion. However, decision maker DMkmay have a similar opinion with decision maker DMjand have very different opinion from decision maker DMl, j, k, l ∈ M. The differences in the proximity between the decision makers reveal the possibilities of opinion transitions from one decision maker to other decision makers. Generally, it is easier to have DMkchange his opinion to the same as or more similar to DMj’s opinion than to DMl’s because of the proximity of their respective opinions. Also the opinion transition possibility shows the level of agreement between one decision maker and another. This opinion transition process can be seen as a finite state space Markov chain. Considering we defined the ICI index to measure the closeness of two decision makers’ judgment in a group AHP context, we can define the opinion transition probability from one decision maker to another:(7)pvs=1/ICIvs∑s=1m1ICIvs,v∈Mwhere∑smpvs=1, pvs> 0. Then by calculating the opinion transition probabilities between any two decision makers in D, we have a Markov matrix of opinion transitionsP=(pvs)m×m, which is irreducible and ergodic because all of the elements in this matrix are positive (Kijima, 1997). The limiting distribution which is also the only stationary distribution of this Markov chain can be seen as the power or weight distribution of decision makers in a group. The limiting distribution π can be calculated byRoss (2009):(8)πP=πwhereπ=(π1,π2,…,πm)T,∑kmπk=1, πk≥ 0. Letρk=πk, we can get the weight vectorρ=(ρ1,ρ2,…,ρm)Tof decision makers.Remark 1The proposed weight allocating method relies on neither a judge's subjective judgment nor the distance to the aggregated group opinion, but rather on the comparison among the individuals. The advantage of our method over the subjective ones is that the subjective judgment from the judge of judges is difficult to obtain in the real application. Also the subjective bias of a judge will always exist and can be difficult to reduce. Previously, the objective way to find an optimized weight vector was associated with the aggregated group opinion. Thus the distance or similarity between the individuals to the aggregated group is used in these centricity-oriented methods. However, the proximity among the individuals, which contains more information, has not been used in prior methods. Thus our method, by using this peer to peer information to avoid this loss of information can provide more persuasive and reliable results. Moreover, a precondition of the centricity oriented methods is to define or find an appropriate aggregation function. Different aggregation functions may cause different results of weight allocating. Thus the robustness of such weight determining method is weaker than the proposed method.As a certain level of group consensus is a necessity in group decision making, during the group decision making process, consensus reaching models can be applied to aid the decision makers to improve their consensus level. In a traditional consensus reaching model, there is often a moderator, via the collection and exchange of opinions, who tries to give advice to the experts on how to revise or update their opinions to bring their judgments closer together. As a result, subjectivity may be introduced to the consensus reaching process by the moderator. Thus as shown in Fig. 3, we give a group AHP consensus reaching model incorporating a feedback mechanism as a substitute for the moderator's suggestions.The feedback mechanism, which determines how to improve the consensus level, is crucial in a group consensus reaching model. Without loss of generality, suppose that DMaand DMbare selected in the tth iteration, a, b ∈ M, feedback suggestions should be provided to help them revise their PCMs and improve their consensus level. The new PCMsAat+1andAbt+1should be constructed by using the following strategy:(9)aij(a)t+1=(aij(a)t)αat(aij(b)t)1−αat(10)aij(b)t+1=(aij(b)t)αbt(aij(a)t)1−αbtwhereατtis a parameter which determines what amounts and relative portion of the new PCMAτt+1of decision maker DMτis from his own original PCMAτt. As a dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model, the portion of the experts’ prior judgments that are preserved should be updated in each round of the consensus reaching process, so that as the consensus level increases the portion of the judgments preserved should also increase. In addition, as can be seen in Eqs. (9) and (10), the new PCM of a selected decision maker is composed of his/her original PCM and the original PCM from another selected decision maker, who is the most incompatible one with him in the group. Thus determining the portion of judgment preservation is also determining which decision maker is more credible. It is reasonable that decision makers with higher incompatibility with other decision makers will need more guidance than those decision makers that with higher consensus levels. Thus when the dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model advises the decision makers to revise their judgments, the amount of judgment preservation required for each decision maker is adjusted depending on his degree of consensus with the unselected decision makers; and have(11)αat=1−∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIal2(∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIal+∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIbl)(12)αbt=1−∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIbl2(∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIal+∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIbl)From Eqs. (11) and (12), three important properties are worth addressing: (1)ατt∈(0.5,1), τ ∈ {a, b}. Thusατtis bounded to make sure to avoid too large of a change in the decision makers’ opinion which helps preserve their sovereignty and the value of their input. (2) if∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIal≥∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIbl, thenαat≤αbt, and vice versa. It shows that if one of two selected decision makers has a lower degree of consensus with the unselected decision makers than another, therefore he\she has lower credibility and should be required to make a greater change to his\her judgments. (3)αat=αbtif and only if∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIal=∑l=1,l≠a,bmICIbl. This property implies that if they have the same consensus level with unselected decision makers, they have the same degree of credibility.By using this dynamic and adaptive strategy, the proposed peer to peer dynamic adaptive consensus model will aid all the decision makers to reach a predefined level of acceptable consensus. The details of our peer to peer dynamic adaptive consensus model are depicted in the following Algorithm.Input: Initial PCMsA1,A2,…,Amwith acceptable levels of consistency according to the threshold value of the individual consensus index ɛ, and the maximum number of iterations T.Output: Final PCMsA1*,A2*,…,Am*, group PCMG*, and the number of iterations t*, 0 ≤ t* ≤ T.Step 1. Let Dtbe the set of all ordered pairs in which the first decision maker has not rejected the updating recommendation from the moderator before the tth iteration. LetD0={(DM1,DM2),…,(DM1,DMm),…,(DMm,DM1),…,(DMm,DMm−1)},t=0,Ak0=(aij(k)0)n×n=(aij(k))n×n.Step 2. Calculate the individual consensus indexICIkltfor all (DMk, DMl) ∈ Dt. If (1) t ≥ T, or (2)Dt=∅, or (3) ∀(DMk, DMl) ∈ Dt,ICIklt≤ɛ, then go to Step 4; otherwise, continue.Step 3. Identify the most incompatible decision makers DMpand DMqwithICIpqt=maxDt{ICIklt}. At least one of the ordered pairs (DMp, DMq) and (DMq, DMp) should be inDt. As such we have 3 cases:(1)Both (DMp, DMq) and (DMq, DMp) are inDt. When both DMpand DMqto update their PCMs by using Eqs. (9) and (10). We have three possible scenarios:(a)If both of them accept this feedback suggestion, we haveAkt+1=(aij(k)t+1)n×n,k ∈ M, where(13)aij(k)t+1={(aij(k)t)αkt(aij(q)t)1−αkt,k=p(aij(k)t)αkt(aij(p)t)1−αkt,k=qaij(k)t,k≠p,qAnd then sett=t+1,Dt+1=Dt, and return to Step 2.If DMxrejects and DMyaccepts this feedback suggestion,x, y ∈ {p, q}, x ≠ y, we haveAkt+1=(aij(k)t+1)n×n, k ∈ M, where(14)aij(k)t+1={(aij(y)t)αkt(aij(x)t)1−αkt,k=yaij(k)t,k≠yThen sett=t+1,Dt+1=Dt−(DMx,DMy), and return to Step 2.If both of them reject this feedback suggestion. Then setAkt+1=Akt, k ∈ M,t=t+1,Dt+1=Dt−(DMp,DMq)−(DMq,DMp), and return to Step 2.(DMq, DMp) is in Dtand (DMp, DMq) is not. Feedback is only provided to DMqaccording to Eq. (9). If DMqrejects this suggestion, then sett=t+1this directed pair is deleted from Dt. We now haveDt+1=Dt−(DMq,DMp), and return to Step 2.If DMqaccepts the feedback, then we haveAkt+1=(aij(k)t+1)n×nwhich is the same as Eq. (14), k ∈ M. Now sett=t+1,Dt+1=Dt, and return to Step 2.(DMp, DMq)is in Dtand (DMq, DMp) is not. The feedback mechanism will advise DMpto update judgments as Eq. (9). Similarly, if DMprejects, we haveDt+1=Dt−(DMp,DMq). Sett=t+1and return to Step 2.If DMpaccepts, then we haveAkt+1=(aij(k)t+1)n×nwhich is the same as Eq. (14), k ∈ M. Next, sett=t+1,Dt+1=Dt, and return to Step 2.Step 4. This step is implemented when one of the three stopping conditions is met. LetAk*=Akt, and determine the weight vectorρ=(ρ1,ρ2,…,ρm)Tby using Eqs. (7) and (8). Then we can get the group PCMG* by using Eq. (4). The consensus reaching process is stopped and the final group priority vector is obtained fromG*.Remark 2As can be seen from Fig. 3, there are three stop conditions to avoid entering an infinite loop in the consensus reaching process. First, ɛ is fixed in advance and represents the necessary level of group consensus. If all decision makers meet the requirements of consensus, then the process should be terminated. However, if the value of ɛ is too high it may cause the consensus condition to never be satisfied, and as a consequence, we have an infinite looping consensus process. Thus in order to avoid this infinite loop, we define a parameter T in advance that limits the maximum number of iterations. Third, if all members in the group refuse to revise their judgment, the consensus reaching process should be ended.Remark 3A natural way to improve the consensus level in a group is to select the most incompatible decision makers because they have the biggest potential for consensus improvement. If the most incompatible pair of decision makers revise and come closer together then the upper bound of the entire group's incompatibility would be decreased. Based on this principle we develop the proposed consensus reaching algorithm and prove that this algorithm is convergent and effective. In our model, the feedback mechanism suggests only one pair of decision makers that has a maximum ICI in each round. If there are two or more pairs of decision makers with the same maximum ICI in the same round, they can also be given the feedback suggestion within that round.As was discussed in Section 1, the decision makers are usually thought to follow the feedback suggestion to modify their judgments to support a successful group decision making process. However, this approach still gives them the opportunity to reject the suggestion without any penalties. In addition, the feedback mechanism can provide the suggestions automatically without a moderator. Furthermore, the additional burden on the decision makers through the subsequent rounds of the consensus reaching process is reduced. The decision makers only need to provide their initial judgments in the first round and then choose to follow the suggestion or not in the following steps of process. On the other hand, this method can be more interactive should the decision makers choose to compromise on the suggested feedback.Remark 4Previous studies on group consensus reaching models primarily use the aggregated group judgment as the reference point in the consensus reaching process (Perez, Cabrerizo, Alonso, & Herrera-Viedma, 2014). They use this aggregated group judgments to find the incompatible decision makers and then revise their opinion using the group judgments as the model. In contrast to those centricity-oriented methods, the dynamic and adaptive process in the proposed peer to peer consensus reaching model always compares the information from one individual to another. As shown in Fig. 3, this peer-to-peer dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model first calculates the ICI to find the most incompatible pair of decision makers. Then the automatic feedback mechanism provides the suggestion to each selected individual to update his\her original judgments to the new compromise judgments according to the opinion from the opposite side. In other words, no aggregated group judgments are used to serve as the reference points, nor are they used in the consensus improving process in our peer to peer consensus reaching model. This in turn reduces the costs and biases in the aggregation process.The consistency of PCMs and the effectiveness of the consensus reaching process in our model are discussed below.Theorem 1In the proposed consensus reaching model, suppose all m initial PCMsA1,A2,…,Amprovided by the decision makers are of acceptable consistency, then the final PCMsA1*,A2*,…,Am*are of acceptable consistency.ProofThe proof of Theorem 1 is provided in Appendix A.As the decision makers may change their PCMs according to the feedback suggestion, the acceptable consistency of the new PCMs should be checked and guaranteed. From Theorem 1, we know that the proposed consensus reaching process holds the consistent properties of the PCMs. It implies that if we can make sure the initial PCMs provided by the decision makers are of acceptable consistency, then we will have the acceptable consistent output after using our consensus reaching model. Therefore, we should do the consistency checks to make sure that all the input PCMs from the decision makers are all of acceptable consistency. In addition, the algorithm in our proposed consensus reaching model is convergent effective to improve the consensus level in a group.Theorem 2In the tth round of the proposed consensus reaching model,0≤t≤t*−1, ifICIklt≥ɛ, ∀k, l ∈ M, then we have(15)maxk,l∈M{ICIklt+1}≤maxk,l∈M{ICIklt}ProofThe proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Appendix B.Therefore, in each round of the consensus reaching process, the maximum incompatibility in a group will not exceed the maximum incompatibility in the last round. Thus the maximum individual consensus index should be non-increasing in our consensus reaching process. In the cases where the decision makers accept the modification provided by the automatic feedback mechanism, the proof shows that the model is convergent. Thus the feedback suggestion in our model is effective in increasing the level of group consensus.We use the following group decision making problem which was discussed by Y. Dong et al. (2010) , Wu and Xu (2012b) and Q. Dong and Saaty (2014). Suppose we have four alternatives X1, X2, X3 and X4 to be ranked and five decision makers DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, and DM5 with PCMsAk=(aij(k))4×4and the corresponding priorities in the last column of the matrices,k=1,2,3,4,5, whereA1=(14671/41341/61/3121/71/41/21|0.61680.22380.09720.0621),A2=(15791/51461/71/4121/91/61/21|0.65260.22470.07620.0465),A3=(13581/31451/51/4121/81/51/21|0.57050.27710.09590.0565),A4=(14561/41331/51/3121/61/31/21|0.59700.22170.10840.0728),A5=(11/212212311/2141/21/31/41|0.21850.41230.26790.1013).The consistency ratios ofAkare:CRA1=0.0383,CRA2=0.0678,CRA3=0.0339,CRA4=0.0471,CRA5=0.0363, which indicate that the given PCMs are of acceptable consistency. The threshold value of the individual consensus index is set such thatɛ=1.03and the maximum number of iterationsT=10. Now we show how to apply the proposed consensus reaching model to adjust the weights and update the judgments. Lett=0,Ak0=Ak,k=1,2,3,4,5,D0={(DM1,DM2),…,(DM1,DM5),…,(DM5,DM1),…(DM5,DM4)}. Using Eq.

We now haveICI454=maxD4{ICIkl4}. However, the ordered pair (DM4, DM5) is not in D4. The automatic feedback mechanism will just provide the suggestion to DM5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The decision making process frequently involves multiple decision makers. One of the most widely used multi-criteria decision making methods in the group decision context is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). For determining the weights of importance of decision makers, a Markov chain weight allocating method based on the opinion transition probabilities, was presented. The selection of the incompatible decision maker is based on the individual consensus index (ICI), which dynamically changes in response to the decision makers’ updated judgments. Thus the most incompatible pair of decision makers would change in different iterations of the algorithm, though the selection method is deterministic. This algorithm has been proven to be convergent and helpful to improve group consensus. In addition this algorithm has other important properties such as adaptive judgment revision, consistency preservation, and democracy, etc. Therefore, in our opinion, for a group consensus reaching problem, the proposed algorithm works very well and provides some advantages over the other classic methods in this field.The numerical example provided shows the details of the proposed model and demonstrates its effectiveness. The authors plan to extend the proposed model to other types of preference relations. It is also an important task to develop a group decision support system based to allow the easy adoption of our model.
