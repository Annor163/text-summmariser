@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To meet the main requirements of output displacement, bandwidth frequency and accuracy in noncircular turning, a fast tool servo (FTS) system based on piezoelectric (PZT) voltage feedback is developed. A flexure hinge structure is designed to amplify the output of PZT actuator and topology optimization is done to reduce the mass and compliance of the structure so that the output displacement and response frequency of FTS can be improved. A compound controller, into which repetitive techniques, PI and feed-forward control, are introduced, and the method that PZT voltage of the actuator is treated as feedback are put forward. The feasibility and reliability of this system are proved well by turning experiments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In industrial applications, many workpieces with an irregular surface are much better in improving the performance than traditionally flat or cylindrical ones. For instance, piston skirt and pinhole are noncircular surfaces in order to obtain more uniform pressure and improve the bearing capacity [1,2], and bearing rings also do not have a shape of a cylindrical surface in the machining process to diminish the effect of clamping forces [3].Fast tool servo (FTS) plays a key role in free-form (non-axisymmetric) surface machining, noncircular turning, and can be used in conjunction with traditional machine tools, e.g. NC lathe, to accomplish machining the asymmetric geometric feature of these surfaces with respect to spindle rotation. For instance, the shape of the piston skirt is not a perfect cylinder, but middle convex in axial section and varying ellipse in cross section.Fig. 1is the profile of noncircular section of a piston at a certain height of the piston skirt, typically, an ellipse curve. The radial feeding of a cutting tool isy(t)=(R−r)[1−cos(2θ)],Ris the long axis of ellipse,ris the short axis of ellipse,θis the rotational degree, andθ=2πωt/60, whereωis the spindle speed in rpm.In order to meet the requirements of noncircular turning or boring, FTS has to have large low frequency output displacement, high small signal bandwidth. In gasoline piston skirt turning, the output displacement of FTS is over300μmand the tool feeding frequency isf=2ω/60. When the spindle speed is 3000rpm, the response frequency of FTS, in which FTS will accurately respond to a control signal, is at least 100Hz.The methods of actuating FTS fall into the following categories: piezoelectric [4–6], magnetostrictive [7], Lorentz force which includes permanent magnet motors, voice coil and linear motor [8–11], and electromagnetic [12,13].Piezoelectric (PZT) actuators with their infinite resolution, high stiffness and high frequency are widely used in many areas. Otherwise, because the maximum output displacement of the stacked actuator, d33 type, is only 1/1000 of their length, and it has to be amplified to meet the long-travel requirement. A flexure-hinge structure is designed to magnify the output displacement of the PZT actuator.Though the PZT actuator can be much increased in the output displacement, the whole FTS also in mass due to the amplifying structure is incorporated in it. The response frequency of FTS heavily depends upon the mass and the stiffness of tool holder and servo, in this paper, optimization is done to reduce the whole mass for bettering its frequency bandwidth. The controller, which employs the repetitive control techniques based on PZT voltage feedback and supplies high dynamic stiffness to the tool feeding mechanism, is put forward.The maximum stress of amplifying structure is on the free edge of a right circular flexure hinge [14], and is reversely dependent on its stiffness under the same deforming. The principles of design are to keep the maximum stress as low as possible and to obtain the maximum stiffness on the basis of having the output displacement satisfied in noncircular piston turning. These principles can also ensure the system to have higher natural frequency and better anti-vibration capability.Fig. 2is the schematic diagram of FTS. The structure based on the right circular flexure hinge is used to amplify the output of the PZT actuator. Because of the asymmetry of the amplifying structure, the tool feeding pathway is not only mainly in the Y direction but also very slightly in the X direction, and this effect is diminished by the round flexure hinge on the tool bar. Both the main cutting force Fzand the feed force Fxare carried by linear bearing. The thrust force Fy, which is transferred to the amplifying mechanism, is about 300N when the maximum amount of feeding is 0.5mm.The flexure hinge is an elastic joint, which connects rigid bodies or links, for small displacement. The flexure hinge is relatively slender, and often used to develop a compliant mechanism, when compared with other parts in the compliant mechanism. It functions as a rotational joint, however, without friction, wear and backlash.The right circular flexure hinge [15–17] is precise in rotation, and its rotation center does not displace as other types of flexure hinge, and it is always treated as a torsional spring only around the Z-axis, see Fig. 3. In the right circular flexure hinge,t/Rratio (t is the neck thickness, R is the radius) is a very important factor, and different compliance equations should be chosen at differentt/Rratios to obtain more accurate result [18].The force analysis of flexure-hinge amplifying structure is illustrated in Fig. 4. The flexure hinges are simplified as rotational spring, and PZT actuator as a spring–mass structure.(1)Fy=kPZT′yB2+4kθyL12whereB=L1/L2is the amplifying ratio of the structure,kPZT′, which is determined by the axial stiffness of the PZT actuator and the contact stiffness between PZT actuator and amplifying structure is called the equivalent stiffness of piezoelectric actuator.The equivalent stiffness of the structure, K, is as below:(2)K=kPZT′B2+4kθL12The amplifying structure is a spring–mass system, the dynamic analysis of it is shown in Fig. 4, and the rotation of M2 is neglected due to very slight movement of it in the X direction. The kinetic and potential energy is as below:(3)Ek=12M2ẏ2+2[12M1(ẏ2)2+12I1(ẏL1)2]+12MPZT(ẏB)2(4)Ep=4[12kθ(yL1)2]+12kPZT′(ΔL−yB)2where L1 and I1 are the length and the moment of inertia of M1, respectively,MPZTis the equivalent mass of the piezoelectric actuator,ΔLis the output displacement of the piezoelectric actuator.Plugging the upper two equations into the Langrange equation, the following result is obtained:(5)(M1+M2+2I1L12+MPZTB2)y¨+(4kθL12+kPZT′B2)y=kPZT′BΔLIn Eq. (5),ΔLis a function of voltage applied to the PZT actuator,ΔL=f(V):(6)My¨+Ky=kPZT′Bf(V)where M and K are the equivalent mass and the equivalent stiffness of the structure respectively.Thus, the undamped natural frequency of amplifying structure is as below:(7)F=12πKMAccording to the above analysis, the stiffness of this FTS is mainly dependent on the stiffness of amplifying structure and the contact stiffness between PZT actuator and amplifying structure. The response frequency of this FTS is heavily determined by the mass of amplifying structure attached to PZT actuator, though the frequency bandwidth of PZT actuator is relatively high. To increase the response frequency, a topology optimization for compliance optimization should be done on the amplifying structure to reduce its mass and to increase its modal frequency.Topology optimization is started with the landmark paper of Bendsoe and Kikuchi [19], and a SIMP method is used in this paper. In topology optimization, a finite element analysis must be carried out in each iteration. From iteration to iteration, the properties of each finite element in a designed space such as Young's modulus and density are modified until the optimization objectives are fulfilled.Fig. 5is the finite model of amplifying structure on which Fa, Fcand constraints are exerted. The properties of the original amplifying structure are first modal frequency of 219Hz, mass of 2.399kg, and maximum stress of 54.9MPa. In this finite model, except for the yellow part which is the undesign space, the other is design space in which the element density could be changed during each iteration:(8)Minimize:Compliancesubjectto:F=Fc+Fa:outputdisplacement>400μm:maximumstress<930/sMPawhere 930MPa is the yield stress of spring steel 50CrV, s is the safety factor, Fcis the cutting force and Fais the output force of PZT actuator.Fig. 6is the result of topology optimization, an isosurface figure. The material distribution is shown and the design proposals can be indicated. Fig. 7is the compliance and the modal frequency of the structure from iteration to iteration, the minimum compliance and the maximum modal frequency are achieved at last. Actually, the process technique of the structure should be taken into account, for the optimization result is not a real part which can be manufactured.Some parameters of original amplifying structure are compared to the redesigned one in Table 1. The modal frequency increased from 219.3Hz to 305.5Hz, the mass decreased from 2.399kg to 1.866kg and the maximum stress increased slightly. The main geometric parameters of amplifying structure are R=4mm, t=2mm, b=40mm, L1=68mm and B=3.Because of the hysteresis of PZT, an appropriate mathematic model has to be established in order to achieve high control quality but not to result in a very complicated control structure and algorithm. The periodic feature of noncircular turning should be taken into account when the controller is designed.Piezoelectric actuator can be modeled as the linear lumped second order mechanical system by both the linear piezoelectric equation and Newton's law. Its mathematic model is the following:(9)Mad2xdt2+Dadxdt+Kax=Fa+Fextwhere x is the output displacement of the piezoactuator, Mais the mass of piezoactuator, Dais the damping of piezoactuator, Kais the stiffness of piezoactuator, Fais the transduced force of PZT actuator, Fextis the external mechanical load. The open-loop transfer function of piezoactuator with disturbance is as below:(10)[nVin(s)ZCs+1+Fext]BMas2+Das+Ka=X(s)where Vin(s) is the input voltage to PZT actuator, Z is the output impedance of driving power and C is the capacitance of piezoelectric actuator, n is the coupling factor of PZT ceramic between the electric and mechanical domain.The open-loop transfer function of FTS with disturbance, see Fig. 8, is the following:(11)X(s)=nZCs+1BMs2+Ds+KVin(s)−(nd33ZsZCs+1+1)B2Fext(s)Ms2+Ds+Kwhere M, D, K and B are the equivalent mass, the equivalent damping, the equivalent stiffness of FTS and the amplifying ratio of the structure, respectively.In noncircular turning, both input reference and main disturbance are periodic so the tracking precision of periodic command has to be taken into account.Repetitive control is put forward by Inoue et al. [20] and based on internal model principle [21]. In a stable system, an internal model is employed to generate a periodic signal which has the same period with input reference so that the system could track an external periodic signal asymptotically. Any signal with period of L will be generated by a time-delay system possessing positive feedback. In noncircular turning,L=60/ω. Since not any order of frequency can be tracked in practice, a low-pass filter, F(s), is incorporated to stabilize the system:(12)F(s)=1τs+1whereτis the time constant of a filter.Because the feed-forward control is an open-loop control for the measurable disturbance, it does not change the characteristics of the feedback control system. Theoretically, a feed-forward control method can be used to eliminate the main error caused by disturbance.Piezoelectric ceramic has not only an actuator function but also a sensor function, the electric potential is varying when external forces are exerted on it. This piezoelectric voltage is treated as a feedback, the relationship between output displacement and piezoelectric voltage is as below:(13)Vext(s)=d33ZsZCs+1BX(s)where d33 is the piezoelectric constant.Therefore, a compound control method is put forward, see Fig. 9.Gn(s) and G(s) are the transfer functions of disturbance channel and controlled plant respectively, see Eq. (11). GPIis the transfer function of the proportional and integral (PI) controller. Df(s) is the transfer function of feed-forward controller:(14)Df(s)=−Gn(s)G(s)The equivalent system of the compound control system is shown in Fig. 10.Small gain theorem is used to prove the condition of stability. If(15)GPIG1−aHGPIGisastableandrationalfunctionanda(s)is a stable and proper rational function:(16)‖F[1+HGPIG(1−a)]1−aHGPIG‖∞<1where(17)H(s)=Bnd33ZsZCs+1In order to keep the stability of the system, the requirements of the following two equations must be met:(18)|1+H(jω)GPI(jω)G(jω)|>|1F(jω)|(19)|1−aH(jω)GPI(jω)G(jω)|>|F(jω)|(ω<ωc)whereωcis the cut-off frequency of the system.Under the conditions above, smallerτfor the filter, wider frequency bandwidth could be tracked by the system and smaller steady-state error the system will have.
