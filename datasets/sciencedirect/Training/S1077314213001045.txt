@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Topological properties are with invariance and take priority over other features, which play an important role in cognition. This paper introduces a new attention selection model called TPA (topological properties-based attention), which adopts topological properties and quaternion. In TPA, using Unit-linking PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) hole-filter expresses an important topological property (the connectivity) in visual attention selection. Meanwhile, using the quaternion Fourier transform based phase spectrum of an image or a frame in a video obtains the spatio-temporal saliency map, which shows the result of attention selection. Adjusting the weight of a topological channel can change its influence. The experimental results show that TPA reflects the real attention selection more accurately than PQFT (Phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we introduce a model called TPA (topological properties-based attention) for attention selection, which adds topological properties to PQFT (Properties based Phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform) model [1,2]. PQFT model uses the phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform to obtain the spatio-temporal saliency map of attention selection. Unlike previous models of attention selection, our model TPA is based on the fact shown by Chen [13] that topological properties play a key role in perceptual organization. The topological property used in this paper is expressed by Unit-linking PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) hole-filter [3,4] using pulse transmission of PCNN. The two main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, inspiring by topological perception theory in psychology, we introduce topological properties to attention selection. Secondly, we propose a new model based on topological perception theory that achieves better attention saliency maps than PQFT.There are bottom-up attention and top-down one in cognition. Some objects automatically effortlessly “pop-out” from their surroundings, that is, they draw our visual attention in a “bottom-up” manner. This is called bottom-up attention. Focal visual attention feeds back and locally modulates visual processing and representation of selected objects in a “top-down” manner, which is called top-down attention [5]. In computer vision, there were many bottom-up models simulating visual attention, such as NVT, PQFT, SR, and STB [6,1,7,8]. Among these bottom-up models, it is NVT, the earliest model presented by Itti [5,6,9–11] that has been used widely. TPA method in this paper is also a bottom-up attention model.Topological perception theory is the psychological foundation of our model. According to research finds of visual process, topological perception theory is an important branch of psychology [12,13,15,16,19]. It addresses the importance of topological properties with invariance in visual perception. Topological properties are invariant and stable in topological transformation. Visual perception is an essential part of visual attention and topological properties with invariance play an important role in visual perception. This inspires us to apply topological properties in visual attention.The paper consists of seven sections. Section 2 introduces topological perception theory, emphasizing its two characteristics: invariance and priority. Section 3 describes the fundamental knowledge of quaternion and hypercomplex Fourier transform. In our model TPA, utilizing the phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform obtains spatio-temporal saliency map. Section 4 describes PCNN (Pulse Coupled Neural Network) model and Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter. PCNN developed from Eckhorn’s linking model [14]. Unit-linking PCNN is a simplified version of PCNN, and hole-filter based on Unit-linking PCNN is used here to express connectivity, a topological property used to enhance the perception of the whole object. Section 5 presents and analyzes our TPA model in detail. In Section 6, experimental results show that using TPA model, the quality of spatio-temporal saliency improves apparently, which reflects real attention distribution better. The last section gives conclusions.Figs. 1 and 2illustrate the structure of TPA for images and TPA for videos respectively. It is the information of connectivity expression that inputs to the topological channel. Fig. 3shows how to introduce a topological channel in TPA.Chen proposed topological perception theory in 1982 [12]. Early vision is sensitive to topological structure [12,13]. A topological transformation is a one-to-one and continuous transformation. In detail, it means that topological transformation is a continuous geometric transform meeting the following criteria, (1) not breaking, (2) not merging, (3) any two points not overlapping to become one point. Topological properties are invariant in topological transformation, and they are most stable among image-based features, such as color, edge density, and shape [15,16]. Usually when the local geometrical properties of an object change, the topological properties remain unchanged. For example, a dog could appear in different shapes, but its connectivity keeps invariable. The number “8” has two holes, and if we circumrotate it or do other changes without breaking or fusing, the number of the holes remains unchangeable. Topological properties involve connectivity, the number of holes, inside/outside relation and so on. TPA uses connectivity.Topological perception plays an important part in visual perception [17,18]. It is proposed to address the question of “what are the primitives of visual perception?”. What is the meaning of this question? This question can also be expressed as “where is the beginning of the visual perception process?”. Topology theory gives the following answer. The primitives of visual perception are geometrically invariant, which means human beings perceive topological properties firstly in visual process. The topological approach is based on one core idea and includes two main aspects. The core idea is that perceptual organization should be understood as transformation and invariance among transformation. The first aspect emphasizes the topological structure during perception forming. Namely, the global nature of perceptual organization can be described in terms of topological invariants. The second aspect further highlights early topological perception. Namely, topological perception is prior to perception of local feature properties. The “prior” has two strict meanings. Firstly, it implies that global organization determined by topology is the basis on which perception of local geometrical properties depends. Secondly, topological perception (based on physical connectivity) occurs earlier than perception of local geometrical properties [13].That theory considers that topological perception determines separation between objects and backgrounds in visual process [12,13]. Topological perception is prior to other feature perceptions in visual process, and early vision is very sensitive to topological structure. Honeybee’s brain is very small, but it could distinguish the difference among different topological structures [19]. So it is reasonable to presume that topological perception is fundamental to all vision systems. Perceptual object is invariant to geometric transformation. Psychologists consider that perceptual object leads to attention selection. When a laying cat turns into a moving cat, and its topological properties remain unchanged although the shape of the cat is changed. No new perceptual object appears. A solid triangle turns into a solid circle, and its topological properties remain unchanged. Here we consider that there is no new perceptual object appeared. If it becomes an empty square, which means topological properties has changed, a new perceptual object generates. Attention would concentrate on this perceptual object [13].In this paper, we introduce connectivity (an important topological property) to our TPA model for attention selection. Here connectivity is used to make the model produce attention for a whole object.Quaternion Fourier transform can be applied in color images processing [20–27]. In this paper, we take four features of an image as four channels to produce a quaternion image. These four channels of a quaternion image are composed of one gray intensity channel, two color channels and one topological channel. TPA in this paper utilizes quaternion Fourier transform obtains the phase spectrum, and then utilizes this phase spectrum produces a saliency map. Quaternion Fourier transform performs rapidly and in parallel.A quaternion can be represented in hypercomplex form, see the following equation:(1)q=a+bi+cj+dkLike complex numbers, a, b, c, d are real and i, j, k are complex operators in Eq. (1). Quaternion multiplication is not commutative. The modulus of a quaternion is given as follows:(2)|q|=a2+b2+c2+d2The polar form of a quaternion is defined as:(3)q=|q|eμΦIn (3), eμΦ=cosΦ+μsinΦ,and μ and ϕ are the eigenaxis and eigenangle of the quaternion respectively [5].The formulation of quaternion Fourier transform is shown as follows:(4)F[u,v]=1MN∑m=0M-1∑n=0N-1e-μ2π((mv/M)+(nu/N))f(n,m)In image processing, f(n,m) denotes the pixel value in the original image. [u,v] denotes the location of a pixel in frequency domain. N and M are the image’s height and width respectively.The formulation of inverse Fourier transform is given as follows:(5)f(n,m)=1MN∑v=0M-1∑u=0N-1eμ2π((mv/M)+(nu/N))F[u,v]The symplectic form of a quaternion is given as follows:(6)q=a′+b′μ1+c′μ2+d′μ3It can be also presented as follows:(7)q=A′+B′μ2In Eq. (7), A′=a′+b′μ1, B′=c′+d′μ1, and μ3=μ1μ2. We call A′ the simplex part and B’ the perplex part of the quaternion [20].Literatures [1,2] introduced that the phase spectrum played a main role in the saliency map and amplitude spectrum contributed little to that. In this paper, firstly using quaternion obtains the phase spectrum of quaternion images. Then using this phase spectrum produces saliency map. The computation steps are as follows:1.Using quaternion Fourier transform of a quaternion image obtains its frequency domain expression in polar formq=|q|eμΦ.The amplitude spectrum of q is set to 1. q=|q|eμΦ, which only involves phase spectrum information. Then doing inverse Fourier transform of q gets the spatial domain representation q(t).Saliency maps are obtained finally.Saliency map=G∗||q(t)||2, where G is a 2-dimension gauss filter, σ=8.PCNN consisting of spiking neurons is a kind of spiking neural networks. It is developed from Eckhorn’s linking model [14]. PCNN has been applied in image processing widely [28–31]. A PCN (Pulse Coupled Neuron) has biological support, and it is the simplified version of a real neuron.Fig. 4shows the model of a PCN [3], and it illustrates that a PCN consists of three parts: receptive field, modulation field and pulse generator. The receptive field receives input signals. The modulation field has two channels (L channel and F channel). They do multiplication modulation, and the output signals transmit to the pulse generator, which determines whether the neuron model emit pulses or not.(8)Lj=∑kLkj=∑k[Wkjexp(αkjLt)]⊗Yk(t)+JjFj=∑kFkj=∑k[Mkjexp(αkjFt)]⊗Yk(t)+IjUj=Fj(1+βjLj)dθjdt=-αjTθj+VjTYj(t)Yj=Step(Uj-θj)=1,Uj>θj0,elseEq. (8) describes the model of a PCN. L channel is the linking input Lj. F channel is the feeding input Fj. Jjis the external input to L channel. Ijis the external input to F channel. Wkjand Mkjare weights of L channel and F channel.αkjLandαkjFare the time constants of the L channel and the F channel. Ujis the internal activity, which could determine whether the neuron emit pulses or not with comparing with the threshold θj. Yjis the output. βjis the linking strength.αjTis the time constant andVjTis the amplitude gain of the threshold adjuster. The activity of a PCN can be described as follows. If the internal activity is greater than the threshold, the neuron equals to 1. Then its threshold rises over the internal activity and its output turns to 0. The neuron emits a pulse. The threshold descends with time increasing. When the internal activity is greater than the threshold again, the neuron emits a pulse once again. These PCNs connects to form a PCNN.Computation of PCNN is complex. In order to reduce computation complexity, Unit-linking PCNN, a simplified version of PCNN, was presented. Unit-linking PCNN has used in image segmentation and other image processing [32–34].Fig. 5shows the structure of a Unit-linking PCN [45], which is similar with the structure of a PCN. But it simplifies F channel and L channel. Although Unit-linking PCNN is the simplified model of PCNN, it retains main characteristics (such as pulse spread) of PCNN.(9)Fj=IjLj=step∑k∈N(j)Yk(t)=1,if∑k∈N(j)Yk(t)>00,elseUj=Fj(1+βjLj)dθj(t)dt=-αjT+VjTYj(t)Yj=step(Uj-θj)=1,ifUj>θj0,elseEq. (9) describes the model of a Unit-linking PCN, where the symbols have the same meanings as those in Eq. (8). A Unit-linking PCNN consists of identical Unit-linking PCNs. In image processing based on Unit-linking PCNN, one-to-one correspondence exists between the image pixels and the neurons. Pixel’s intensity inputs to F channel and each neuron connects with other neurons in its neighboring field through L channel. This paper also adopts this connection way. In TPA model, we utilize Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter to get the expression of connectivity. The Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter result of the image (or the frame in a video) inputs to the topological channel in TPA model.According to Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter method, pulses emitted by seed neuron in the background spread in the background out of holes and are blocked by hole boundaries. The hole including the boundary and the region in the boundary correspond to non-fired neurons.Assuming objects corresponding to relatively dark regions and backgrounds corresponding to relatively bright regions, we expand edges of the whole image one pixel as bright regions and choose one of the neurons at this bright region as the seed neuron emitting the initial pulse. With two channels multiplication modulation, we can make neurons fire in the seed neuron’s 4-neighboring field. Pulse waves inspiring by the seed neuron would spread freely and fast in four orientations, which shows pulse-spreading character of PCNN. Pulse waves spread in the background out of holes and are blocked by hole boundaries. The neurons inside holes cannot be excited to fire. Finally, neurons not fired correspond to holes including holes boundaries and other neurons correspond to backgrounds. How do we know the ending of hole-filter? Obviously, if there is no new neuron fired, hole-filter finishes [3,4].When a contour of a whole object composed of different segments is close, sometimes using this hole filter method can merges different segments of this object as a whole one because the contour of the whole object blocks pulses emitted by the seed neuron in the background. In this situation, this whole object will be not segmented into several parts. Unit-linking PCNN could perform hole-filter, not only for binary images, but also for gray intensity images.Fig. 6shows several original images and their Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter results.TPA (topological properties-based attention) is a new model proposed in this paper, which introduces topological properties in attention selection. There are two psychological supports of introducing topological properties in our model. (1) In visual process, topological perception is prior to local geometrical properties perception. (2) Topological properties are invariant to topological transformation, and they are most stable among image-based features [15,16], such as color, edge density, and shape. The algorithm of TPA includes following steps.1.An image or a frame in a video is represented as a quaternion image. Inputting four features of a color image to a quaternion constructs a quaternion image. For images, we input two color pairs, gray intensity and connectivity to a quaternion to produce a quaternion image. For videos, motion replaces gray intensity.Using quaternion Fourier transform computes the phase spectrum of the quaternion image.Finally, using the phase spectrum obtains the spatio-temporal saliency map.In step 1, there is the difference between “for images” and “for videos”. Step 2 and step 3 have been introduced in Section 3. However, how to represent an image as a quaternion image more efficiently still requires further research.There are four channels (one topological channel T, two color channels, and one gray intensity channel) in TPA model for images.TPA model for images includes one topological channel T. Firstly, the input image is turned into a gray image, with resizing linearly to a small one with the size 64pixel*64pixel. Then we do Unit-linking PCNN hole-filter on that compressed image. The output is a binary image, which expresses connectivity of the original image, and it inputs to the topological channel. Fig. 7shows some examples of natural images and their topological channels.In human brains, neurons excited by one color are inhibited by another color. This is called a “color opponent-component” theory. The color pairs include red/green, green/red, blue/yellow and yellow/blue. Based on this fact, two color channels [5] (RG and BY) are adopted in TPA model for images.(10)R=r-(g+b)/2;G=g-(r+b)/2;B=b-(r+g)/2;Y=(r+g)/2-|r-g|/2-b;RG=R-G;BY=B-Y.In Eq. (10), r, g, b are red, green and blue channel of an image respectively. Negative numbers in RG, BY are set to zero.TPA model for images also adopts a gray intensity channel, I=(r+g+b)/3, where “I” denotes the intensity.In TPA model for images, the input image is represented as a quaternion image q by the following equation:(11)q=T+aμ1+bμ2+Iμ3In Eq. (11), a=RG and b=BY. Every channel’s input is a 64*64 matrix, where every element is normalized to [0,1]. Literatures [1,2,7] shown that the 64*64 size of image is good at some frequency domain saliency detection.TPA model for video is similar to that for images, and the only difference is that the motion channel replaces gray intensity channel.A motion channel is defined as follows:(12)M(t)=|I(t)-I(t-τ)|In Eq. (12), I(t) is the gray intensity of the frame captured at time t and τ is a delay variable. In this paper, τ=2. Four channels of TPA model for videos consist of one topological channel, two color channels, and one motion channel.(13)q=T+aμ1+bμ2+Mμ3TPA considers an important topological property (connectivity), so it performs better than PQFT. This will be shown in next section.
