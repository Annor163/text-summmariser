@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Laplace–Beltrami operator is the foundation of describing geometric partial differential equations, and it also plays an important role in the fields of computational geometry, computer graphics and image processing, such as surface parameterization, shape analysis, matching and interpolation. However, constructing the discretized Laplace–Beltrami operator with convergent property has been an open problem. In this paper we propose a new discretization scheme of the Laplace–Beltrami operator over triangulated surfaces. We prove that our discretization of the Laplace–Beltrami operator converges to the Laplace–Beltrami operator at every point of an arbitrary smooth surface as the size of the triangular mesh over the surface tends to zero. Numerical experiments are conducted, which support the theoretical analysis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Laplace–Beltrami operator (LBO) is a generalization of the Laplace operator from flat spaces to manifolds. It plays a central role in many areas, such as image processing (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Kimmel et al., 1997; Sapiro, 2006; Weickert, 1998), surface processing (Bajaj and Xu, 2003; Clarenz et al., 2000; Desbrun et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 2003; Schneider and Kobbelt, 2000, 2001), and the study of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) (Bertalmio et al., 2000; Mayer, 2001; Sapiro, 2006; ter Haar Romeny, 1994). In these applications, the objective surfaces to be processed are usually represented as discrete meshes. Hence, it is necessary in practice to discretize the LBO.The classical Laplace operator on flat spaces is generally approximated by a finite difference method. However, due to the complexity and diversity of the discretized manifold surfaces, the discretization of the LBO is much more complicated than the Laplacian over flat spaces. In the literature, several discretizations have been proposed over triangular meshes (Pinkall and Polthier, 1993; Taubin, 1995; Desbrun et al., 1999; Mayer, 2001; Xu, 2004; Demanet, 2006). Most of them are variants of the cotangent scheme (Pinkall and Polthier, 1993), which is a form of the finite element method, applied to the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a surface. Given a surface with a fine mesh, we expect the discretization computed from such a mesh provides an accurate representation of the underlying surface Laplacian. However, a detailed theoretical analysis of existing discretizations in Xu (2004) shows that while point-wise convergence can be established for special classes of meshes, such as certain meshes with valence-6, or for linear functions over a sphere inR3, none of these methods is convergent for surface meshes in general. Wardetzky (2008) also provided an overview over convergence properties of weak versions of the LBO for embedded polyhedral surfaces from a functional-analytic viewpoint.For the quadrilateral or even general polygonal meshes there are far fewer results. Liu et al. (2008) described a discretization of the LBO on quadrilateral meshes based on a bilinear interpolation of the quadrilateral. They achieved consistency under some special, but not too restrictive conditions. Xiong et al. (2011) obtained a discrete LBO on quadrilateral meshes by averaging the cotangent scheme over all possible triangulations of the given mesh, and Alexa and Wardetzky (2011) extended the cotangent scheme to the case of general polygonal meshes. Recently, Carl (2015) derived a Laplace operator on semi-discrete surface, which is represented by a mapping intoR3possessing one discrete and one continuous variable. He proved consistency of the semi-discrete Laplacian, meaning that it converges point-wise to the Laplace–Beltrami operator when the semi-discrete surface converges to a smooth one, and also showed convergence of the discretization of LBO on quadrilateral meshes defined in Alexa and Wardetzky (2011).In Belkin et al. (2008), the authors introduced a point-wise convergent discretization of the LBO on the triangular mesh, called the mesh Laplacian. The construction is based on a discretization of the heat kernel defined on the flat spaceR2. The convergent properties have been generalized by Belkin et al. (2009) to point clouds inRd, and they constructed the PCD Laplacian. Sun et al. (2009) applied the mesh Laplacian to the computation of the heat kernel signature, which is obtained by restricting the heat kernel to the time domain, and derived a concise and provably informative multi-scale point signature based on the heat diffusion process. A notable recent work (Liu et al., 2012) built a new point-wisely symmetrizable discrete LBO over the point-sampled surface which is also based on the same discretization of the heat kernel. The authors also indicated that their discretization can provide orthogonal bases for further spectral geometric analysis and processing tasks. In Hildebrandt and Polthier (2011), the authors proposed a principle for constructing strongly consistent discrete LBO based on the cotangent weights.In this paper, we present a new discretization scheme that guarantees convergence at each point, which isL∞convergence, and it is applicable to arbitrary triangulated surfaces. We summarize our main contributions as follows:1.Our discretization scheme is based on a discretization of the heat kernel defined on the curved surface embedded inR3. It is much more accurate than the scheme based on the discretization of the heat kernel defined on the plane, especially for waved surfaces with insufficient dense triangulations;Our discretization scheme is applicable to arbitrary triangulated surfaces without the limitation on the quality of the triangular mesh. We study how the surface and its triangulation influence the integral approximation over a surface;Combining the integral approximation results with the idea of approximating the heat flow on a triangular mesh, we present a local and adaptive algorithm for approximating the LBO on an arbitrary surface with a point-wise convergence guarantee for triangular meshes;We propose a method to estimate the parameters involved in the algorithm adaptively; andWe provide experimental results showing that our method outperforms other discretization schemes in terms ofL∞convergence.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the LBO and its approximation. In Section 3, we describe a quantitative measure of how well a triangular mesh approximates the underlying surface. In Section 4, we present and analyze our method for approximating the LBO with a point-wise convergence guarantee for arbitrary triangulated surfaces. Some numerical results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. Some proofs of the theoretical results are presented in Appendix A.In this paper, we consider a smooth compact (oriented) surfaceS⊂R3without boundary. Letx(u1,u2)=[x(u1,u2),y(u1,u2),z(u1,u2)]Tbe the parametric representation ofS, andgαβ=〈xuα,xuβ〉(α,β=1,2)be the coefficients of the first fundamental form ofSwithxuα=∂x∂uα. Setg=det⁡(gαβ),[gαβ]=[gαβ]−1. Let f be aC1smooth function onS, i.e.,f∈C1(S), the tangential gradient operator∇Sacting on f is given by(1)∇Sf=[xu1,xu2][gαβ][fu1,fu2]T∈R3,wherefuα=∂f∂uα. Let v be aC1smooth vector field on surfaceS, we define the tangential divergence operatordivSacting on v by(2)divS(v)=1g[∂∂u1,∂∂u2][g[gαβ][xu1,xu2]Tv].Letf∈C2(S), then∇Sfis aC1smooth vector field onS, and the Laplace–Beltrami operatorΔSapplying to f is defined as(3)ΔSf=divS(∇Sf)=1g[∂∂u1,∂∂u2][g[gαβ][fu1,fu2]T].Let x be a surface point onS, we have (Willmore, 1993)(4)ΔSx=2H(x)∈R3,whereH(x)is the mean curvature normal at x, andH(x)/‖H(x)‖is the unit surface normal.Now we consider the approximation ofΔSf. It is well known that the solutionu(x,t)of the heat equation on surfaceS{ΔSu(x,t)=∂u∂t(x,t),u(x,0)=f(x),can be written asu(x,t)=∫SHSt(x,y)f(y)dν(y),where ν denotes the area of a surface element, andHSt(x,y)is the heat kernel of the surfaceS, i.e., the measure of how much heat propagates from y to x in time t. Thus the heat equation can be rewritten as follows:ΔSu(x,t)=∂∂t∫SHSt(x,y)f(y)dν(y).Recalling thatu(x,0)=f(x)and that∫SHSt(x,y)dν(y)=1,we obtainΔSf(x)=∂∂t∫SHSt(x,y)f(y)dν(y)|t=0=limt→0⁡1t(∫SHSt(x,y)f(y)dν(y)−u(x,0))=limt→0⁡1t(∫SHSt(x,y)f(y)dν(y)−f(x))=limt→0⁡1t∫SHSt(x,y)(f(y)−f(x))dν(y).However, we do not know the exact form of the heat kernelHSt(x,y)for an arbitrary manifold with some rare exceptions, and all we can utilize is the asymptotic form. For example,HSt(x,y)≈14πte−dS(x,y)24t,wheredS(x,y)denotes the geodesic distance between two points x and y on surfaceS. Then, given a pointx∈Sand a functionf:S→R, we obtain the approximation of the LBO, denoted asFSt:(5)FStf(x)=14πt2∫Se−dS(x,y)24t(f(y)−f(x))dν(y),where the parameter t is a positive quantity, which intuitively reflects the size of the neighbourhood considered at the point x. Through the above discussion, we obtain the following theorem.Theorem 1For a given functionf∈C2(S), we have(6)limt→0⁡‖FStf−ΔSf‖∞=0.Remark 1In Belkin et al. (2008), the authors selected the heat kernel asHSt(x,y)≈14πte−‖x−y‖24t,where‖x−y‖denotes the Euclidean distance between two points x and y on surfaceS. But we believe that the geodesic distance is a better choice, especially for the steep surfaces. Numerical experiments in Section 5 will illustrate our statement.From (5), we can observe thatFStis global in the sense that computing the Laplacian of a function at some points requires the integral over the whole surface. Now we localize the approximationFSt. LetSr(x)={y∈S:dS(x,y)≤r}⊂S, we approximateFStby(7)FSrtf(x)=14πt2∫y∈Sr(x)e−dS(x,y)24t(f(y)−f(x))dν(y),and we obtain another theorem.Theorem 2For a given functionf∈C2(S)and a givenr>0, we have(8)limt→0⁡‖FSrtf−ΔSf‖∞=0.ProofFor any pointx∈S, we have|FSrtf(x)−ΔSf(x)|≤|FSrtf(x)−FStf(x)|+|FStf(x)−ΔSf(x)|.For the first term on the right hand side, we have(9)|FSrtf(x)−FStf(x)|=|14πt2∫y∈S\Sr(x)e−dS(x,y)24t(f(y)−f(x))dν(y)|≤14πt2∫y∈S\Sr(x)e−dS(x,y)24t|f(y)−f(x)|dν(y)≤2‖f‖∞A(S)4πt2e−r24t,whereA(S)denotes the area of the surfaceS. Using L'Hospital's rule, we can obtainlimt→0⁡1t2e−r24t=limt→0⁡t−2er24t=limt→0⁡−2t−3−r2t−24er24t=limt→0⁡8t−1r2er24t=limt→0⁡−8t−2−r4t−24er24t=limt→0⁡32r4er24t=0.Combining it with Eqn. (9), we havelimt→0⁡|FSrtf(x)−FStf(x)|=0.On the other hand, we obtain the limitlimt→0⁡|FStf(x)−ΔSf(x)|=0by Theorem 1. Hence, by taking the limit, we obtainlimt→0⁡FSrtf(x)=ΔSf(x), which proves the theorem.  □Theorems 1 and 2 state that these two approximate operatorsFStandFSrtconverge to the LBO at every point on the surface.Let K be a triangular mesh inR3. We now propose a quantitative measure of how well a triangular mesh approximates the underlying surface. We first cite a lemma from Federer (1959).Lemma 3LetSbe a smooth compact (oriented) surface inR3, there exists an open setUSofR3containingSand a continuous map ξ fromUSontoSsatisfying the following property: ifpbelongs toUS, then there exists a unique pointξ(p)realizing the distance fromptoS(ξ is the orthogonal projection ontoS).A proof of this lemma can be found in Federer (1959). We shall also need the notion of the reach of a surface, introduced in Federer (1959).Definition 1The reach of a smooth compact surfaceSis the largestρ>0for which ξ is defined on the (open) tubular neighbourhoodUρ(S)of radius ρ ofS.Definition 2We say that a triangular mesh K is closely inscribed in a smooth surfaceSif(1)all the vertices of K lie onS;K lies inUρ(S)where ρ is the reach ofS; andthe restriction of ξ to K, i.e.,ξ:K→S, is bijective.Here, we assume that the triangular mesh K is closely inscribed inS. We denote the set of triangles of K asTKand denote a generic triangle of K as △.η(△)represents the length of the longest edge of △. LetV(△)denote the set of vertices of △, and then we haverig(△)=supp∈V(△)⁡|sin⁡(θp)|,whereθpis the angle at vertex p of △, denoting the rightness of a triangle △ (Fig. 1), and we have0<rig(△)≤1. Globally, we denoteη(K)=sup△∈TK⁡η(△)as the height of K, and denoterig(K)=min△∈TK⁡rig(△)as the rightness of K.Definition 3We say that K is a sufficiently fine triangular meshKε,δofSif there exist two positive constants ε and δ, such that(10)η(K)≤ερ,rig(K)≥δ.We will later need the following results on the relations between a smooth surfaceSand an approximating triangular meshKε,δofS. Letnpdenote the unit normal ofSat the point p andn△the normal of the triangle △. The following lemma from Morvan and Thibert (2004) compares the behaviour of the normal vector field of a smooth surfaceSwith the normal of each face of a triangulationKε,δ.Lemma 4LetKε,δbe an approximating triangular mesh ofS, then we have(11)sin⁡∠(n△,np)≤(4δ+2)εfor any triangle△∈TKand any pointp∈V(△).For any pointp∈R3, letd(p,S)denote the shortest distance from p to any point in the setS⊂R3, and we have the following lemma.Lemma 5LetKε,δbe an approximating triangular mesh ofS, then we have(i)For any pointp∈K,d(p,S)≤(4δ+3)ε2ρ; andFor any pointx∈S,d(x,K)≤(4δ+3)ε2ρ.Remark 2Results like this lemma have been proposed in Lemma 3.3 in Belkin et al. (2008). We put the proof of this lemma into Appendix A of the paper.In this section, we present our local algorithm for approximating the LBO on an arbitrary surface by constructing the discretized version of the integral (7).First, we construct a discretized version of the integral∫Sg(x)dν(x), whereg:S→Ris a function defined onS, by settingIKg=∑△∈KA(△)3∑p∈V(△)g(p),whereA(△)denotes the area of the triangle △. That is, each triangle of the mesh contributes toIKgthe amount of its area multiplied by the average value of its vertices.Lemma 5 implies that the triangular mesh K is close to the underlying surfaceSboth geometrically and topologically. Intuitively, quantities defined onSare closely related to their analogs defined on K. Indeed, consider an arbitrary but fixed triangle△∈TK, note that although the map ξ is not differentiable on the entire domain K, it is differentiable for the interior of △. We now present a result on bounding the Jacobian of the map ξ.Lemma 6LetKε,δbe an approximating triangular mesh ofSwithε<1/10andδ≥4/37. Given any triangle△∈TK, for any pointpin the interior of △, ξ is differentiable atpand we have|J(p)|≤11−(4δ+3)ε2,whereJ(p)is the Jacobian of the map ξ at the pointp. In particular,|A(S)A(Kε,δ)|≤11−(4δ+3)ε2,whereA(S)andA(Kε,δ)denote the areas ofSandKε,δrespectively.ProofBy Lemma 1 in Morvan and Thibert (2002), we have(12)|J(p)|≤11−‖ξ(p)−p‖λξ(p),whereλξ(p)is the maximal curvature ofSatξ(p). Combining (12) withλξ(p)≤1ρand Lemma 5 (i) above, we obtain|J(p)|≤11−(4δ+3)ε2,which proves the lemma.  □The following lemma from Belkin et al. (2008) bounds the geodesic distancedS(p,q)in terms of the Euclidean distance‖p−q‖between points p and q.Lemma 7Given two pointsp,q∈Sand lettingd=‖p−q‖<ρ/2, we haved≤dS(p,q)≤d+4d33ρ2.The following theorem shows the relation between∫Sg(x)dν(x)andIKgin terms of the parameters of the surface and the mesh.Theorem 8Given a Lipschitz functiong:S→R, letL=Lip(g)be the Lipschitz constant of function g, i.e.,|g(x)−g(y)|≤Lip(g)dS(x,y). Setting‖g‖∞=supx∈S⁡|g(x)|, we have(13)|∫Sgdν−IKg|≤(2ρLε+2δ−(4+3δ)ε2δ−(4+3δ)ε2‖g‖∞)A(S).Remark 3Results like this theorem have been proposed in Theorem 2.5 in Belkin et al. (2008). We put the proof of this theorem into Appendix A of the paper.LetV=⋃△∈TKV(△),andKr(x)=⋃y∈Vr(x)R(y),whereVr(x)={y∈V:dS(x,y)≤r}, andR(x)denotes the union of the triangles sharing the vertexx∈V, i.e., one ring neighbourhood of the vertex x. For anyx∈V, by constructing the discretized version of the integral (7), we obtain the discretization of LBO, denoted asLKrt:(14)LKrtf(x)=14πt2∑△∈Kr(x)A(△)3∑p∈V(△)e−dS(p,x)24t(f(p)−f(x))=14πt2∑p∈Vr(x)A(p)3e−dS(p,x)24t(f(p)−f(x)),whereA(p)denotes the area of the one ring neighbourhood of the vertex p, the parameters t and r are functions of the point x, which will allow the algorithm to adapt to the local mesh size. We will discuss how to calculate the parameters adaptively in detail in Section 5.The following theorem shows the quality of approximatingFSrtbyLKrtin terms of the parameters of the surface and the triangular mesh.Theorem 9LetKε,δbe an approximating triangular mesh ofSwithε<1/10andδ≥4/37. Given a functionf∈C1(S), let‖f‖∞=supx∈S⁡|f(x)|and‖∇Sf‖∞=supx∈S⁡‖∇Sf‖, for any pointx∈S, we have(15)|LKrtf(x)−FSrtf(x)|≤A(S)2πt2⋅{[Cρεt−12+2δ−(4+3δ)ε2δ−(4+3δ)ε2]‖f‖∞+ρε‖∇Sf‖∞}.ProofFirst, setg(y)=14πt2e−dS(x,y)24t(f(y)−f(x)). Comparing Eqn. (7) and Eqn. (14), we obtain that(16)|LKrtf(x)−FSrtf(x)|=|∫Srgdν−IKrg|.By Theorem 8, to bound the above quantity, we bound‖g‖∞and the Lipschitz constant of g. It is easy to verify that‖g‖∞≤12πt2‖f‖∞.ForLip(g), since g isC1-continuous, it is upper bounded by‖∇Sg‖∞=supy∈S⁡‖∇Sg(y)‖.On the other hand, we have‖∇Sg(y)‖≤14πt2(2‖f‖∞⋅‖∇Se−dS(x,y)24t‖+‖∇Sf(y)‖).To bound‖∇Se−dS(x,y)24t‖, lety(u1,u2)be the parametric representation ofS, then we haveyuα=∂y∂uα,gαβ=〈yuα,yuβ〉,[gαβ]=[gαβ]−1,φ(y)=φ(y(u1,u2))=e−dS(x,y)24tandφuα=∂φ∂uα. By definition,∇Sφ=[yu1,yu2][gαβ][φu1,φu2]T,then we have‖∇Sφ‖2=[φu1,φu2][gαβ][yu1,yu2]T[yu1,yu2][gαβ][φu1,φu2]T=[φu1,φu2][gαβ][φu1,φu2]T.Since[gαβ]is fully dependent on the surface,[gαβ]is bounded for smooth surface. Hence, we have‖∇Sφ‖2≤C(|φu1|2+|φu2|2+|φu1φu2|),where C refers to a certain positive constant in this paper. To bound‖∇Sφ‖2, we need to bound|φu1|and|φu2|. For|φu1|, we have|φu1|=e−dS(x,y)24tdS(x,y)2t|∂dS(x,y)∂u1|≤Ce−dS(x,y)24tdS(x,y)2t≤C1t,where|∂dS(x,y)∂u1|is bounded by some positive constant C for a smooth surfaceSand the last inequality holds asz/ez2≤1for any real number z. Similarly, we can obtain|φu2|≤C1t. It then follows that‖∇Sφ‖2≤C1t,and‖∇Se−dS(x,y)24t‖=‖∇Sφ‖≤C1t.Thus,‖∇Sg‖∞=supy∈S⁡‖∇Sg(y)‖≤14πt2(C‖f‖∞t+‖∇Sf‖∞).Combining with Theorem 8 and putting everything together, we prove the theorem.  □Theorem 10LetKε,δbe an approximating triangular mesh ofS, we sett(ε)=εαfor an arbitrary fixed positive number0<α<2/5. Then for anyf∈C2(S), we have(17)limε→0⁡supKε,δ⁡‖LKrt(ε)f−ΔSf‖∞=0,where the supremum is taken over all approximating triangular meshesKε,δofS.Remark 4Results like this theorem have been proposed in Theorem 2.1 in Belkin et al. (2008). We put the proof of this theorem into Appendix A of the paper.By now, we have proven that, as the approximating mesh of the surface becomes denser, our discretization of LBO on K converges to the Laplace–Beltrami operator onS.This section aims to exhibit the numerical behaviours of our discretization of LBO defined by (14). To show the numerical convergence ofLKrt, we compute the mean curvature using (4). Let d denote the maximal edge length of the triangular mesh K, which is called the mesh size of K.Since our algorithm is based on a no-boundary condition and it holds for interior points of a surface, we consider six two-variable functions over the region[−3,3]×[−3,3]in the uv-plane as surfaces inR3,(18)F1(u,v)=18−u2−v2;F2(u,v)=u2+v2;F3(u,v)=tanh⁡(9v−9u);F4(u,v)=1.25+cos⁡(5.4v)6+6(3u−1)2;F5(u,v)=exp⁡(−8116(u2+v2));F6(u,v)=sin⁡(5u)sin⁡(5v).Their exact mean curvatures can be easily computed analytically. The surfaces are triangulated by triangulating the planar domain first and then mapping the planar triangulation onto the surface via the selected bivariate functions. Both the exact and approximated mean curvatures are computed at some selected domain points(ui,vj)∈[−1,1]×[−1,1]. As the first test case, the planar domain is triangulated as shown in Fig. 2(a), and the points are chosen as(ui,vj)=(i5,j5)fori=−5,…,−1,0,1,…,5;j=−5,…,−1,0,1,…,5. The second test case is an unstructured domain triangulation as shown in Fig. 2(b), and we compute the exact and approximated mean curvatures at all the vertices in[−1,1]×[−1,1].In the numerical experiments, we need to choose the input values for parameters t and r in (14). In order to compute t adaptively, we adopt a fitting method. Firstly, we choose the domain as[0,1]×[0,1]and setr=22, then for the regular mesh, the fitting method is as follows:(1)Triangulate the domain around the point(0.5,0.5)locally as shown in Fig. 2(a) withdi=120⋅2i, wherei=0,1,2,3.For the point(0.5,0.5)in each meshKi, set a series of different values to t, for example,tj=j⁎0.0001,j=1,2,⋯,1000, compute the absolute errors between the exact and approximated mean curvatures of the surfaces defined by the functions(19){Bk(u,v)}k=02={u2,(u+1)(v+1),v2}respectively. Choose(di,ti,k),k=0,1,2, with the smallest absolute error.Lett=βdγ, and determine the coefficientsβ,γ>0such thatβdiγ=ti,k,i=0,1,2,3;k=0,1,2hold in the least square sense. By taking the natural logarithm on both sides of these equations, we obtainln⁡β+γln⁡di=ln⁡ti,k,i=0,1,2,3;k=0,1,2.This system is solved by solving its normal equation. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 4(a) and(20)t=0.2601d1.7947,where d denotes the local mesh size around the point x, that is, the average distance between x and its one ring neighbor vertices.Similarly for the unstructured mesh, our fitting method is as follows:(1)The original triangular partition of the domain[0,1]×[0,1]is shown in Fig. 3. It is recursively subdivided by linear bisection for three times. For the vertex 226, it is easy to see that its valance is 7, one of its one ring neighbour vertices, whose index is 392, has a valance of 5, and others are all valance-6 vertices.For the vertex 226 and its one ring neighbour vertices in each meshKi, compute the local mesh sizes respectively, then average them to obtaindifor each mesh.For the vertex 226 and its one ring neighbour vertices in each meshKi, set a series of different values to t, compute the absolute errors between the exact and approximated mean curvatures of the surfaces defined by (19) at these vertices respectively, then average them to obtain the averaged absolute error at vertex 226. Choose(di,ti,k)with the smallest absolute error.Lett=βdγ, and determine the coefficientsβ,γ>0such thatβdiγ=ti,k,i=0,1,2,3;k=0,1,2hold in the least square sense. By taking the natural logarithm on both sides of these equations, we obtainln⁡β+γln⁡di=ln⁡ti,k,i=0,1,2,3;k=0,1,2.Again, this system is solved by solving its normal equation. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 4(b) and(21)t=0.0568d0.9215.For the parameter r, from Eqn. (9) with the precomputed t, we have|FSrtx(p)−FStx(ω)|≤14πt2e−r24t((|x(ω)|A(S)+‖x‖L1)2+(|y(ω)|A(S)+‖y‖L1)2+(|z(ω)|A(S)+‖z‖L1)2)12≤η,wherex(ω)=[x(ω),y(ω),z(ω)]Tis a parametric representation ofS, andη>0is the threshold. SetT=((|x(ω)|A(S)+‖x‖L1)2+(|y(ω)|A(S)+‖y‖L1)2+(|z(ω)|A(S)+‖z‖L1)2)12,then we obtainr≥(−4hln⁡4πt2ηT)12.In our numerical experiments, givenη>0, the precomputed t and T, we just take r as(22)r=(−4hln⁡4πt2ηT)12.To observe the convergent property, finer and finer domain triangulations are generated. For case (a) in Fig. 2, d is taken to be110,120,140,180or1160. For case (b), the domain is recursively subdivided by the bisection linear subdivision. Hence,d=d0,d02,d04,d08ord016, whered0=0.327804is the maximal edge length of the triangulation as shown in Fig. 2(b).To measure the error between our discretization of the LBO and the surface Laplacian, we consider the maximal error between the approximated mean curvature computed by our proposed approximate operatorLKrtand the exact mean curvature computed from the continuous surfaces defined byFi. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2for the regular and unstructured meshes respectively. It is easy to see that the approximation errors of all six surfaces by our method always approach to zero asd→0, then we come to the conclusion that our proposed approximate operatorLKrtconverges to the surface Laplacian under theL∞norm.Figs. 5 and 6show the distributions of the absolute errors between the exact mean curvatures and the approximated mean curvatures, which are computed by our method on surfaces defined by (18) with regular and unstructured meshes respectively. We can observe that our method achieves pretty good approximations in flat regions, but the absolute errors are relatively large at sharp edges or spikes. This makes sense since the approximated geodesic distance between any two points on triangular mesh K is closely related to the geodesic distance on the original surfaceSin gently changed regions, while it may result in relatively larger error in sharp regions.To better analyze the convergence property of our discretization of the LBO, we compare the behaviours of our method with those of the cotangent scheme (Xu, 2004), mesh Laplacian (Belkin et al., 2008) and PCD Laplacian (Belkin et al., 2009) as the mesh becomes denser and denser. Similar to the computation of our method, we also compute the maximal errors between the exact mean curvature computed from the continuous surfaces defined by (18) and the approximated mean curvatures computed by the above three methods for the regular and unstructured meshes shown in Fig. 2. The numerical results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. We can observe that the maximal absolute errors of all six surfaces using our method always approach to zero as the mesh sizes tend to zero. In contrast, finer mesh does not lead to lower approximation errors by the cotangent scheme, mesh Laplacian and PCD Laplacian. We can see that our discretization provides better approximation than the mesh Laplacian and cotangent scheme, and the PCD Laplacian also provides better approximation except the unstructured mesh defined byF3which has a waterfall shape. The reason why the PCD Laplacian works badly for these meshes is that this method projects the neighbour dataset of the point of interest onto its tangent plane, which introduces significant errors. It is easy to see that the PCD Laplacian achieves better approximation than our discretization on the surfaces defined byF2andF5which have single peaks, when the point cloud is dense enough.
