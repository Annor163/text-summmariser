In the inspection of treated water samples under microscope, knowing the average number of parasite (oo)cysts like Giardia and Cryptosporidium that exist in the samples is crucial as it tells whether the water is safe for consumption. Here, we introduce a new approach using a bidirectional contour tracing technique to segment and enumerate overlapping Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts in microscopic images of treated water samples. First the image is denoised and edge detection is performed to detect the boundary of the (oo)cysts using Kirsch operator. The greyscale image is then binarized to identify the position of the (oo)cysts before it is Otsu thresholded to separate weak edge from strong edge. Then bidirectional contour tracing is implemented to isolate overlapping objects where the boundary of the (oo)cysts is traced in two different directions simultaneously. After boundary tracing, a modified ellipse fitting is executed where partial or broken ellipses can be combined to form completed ellipses that represent (oo)cysts. The proposed technique is tested on 40 FITC microscopic images containing overlapping Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts in treated water samples. The performance of the technique is comparable to better than those of four well-known ellipse detection methods. The technique is also tested on images containing overlapping blood cells, Cryptosporidium oocysts in dirty background and rice grains, and the results are excellent.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Object recognition is an active area of research in image analysis and computer vision. The detection of elliptical objects in images is important since many natural objects like human face, eyes and fruits are elliptical to a certain extent. In fact, circles can be regarded as a special case of an ellipse. Practical applications of ellipse detection in images are not limited for inspection of rigid industrial parts such as washers, rings, and plates, but also for identification of non-rigid objects such as parasites, facial features, erythrocyte and others. Various ellipse detection techniques and applications have been published in the literature but applying contour tracing and ellipse fitting to segment and count overlapping Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts in treated water samples has not been reported yet to the best of our knowledge.Since its inception, Hough transform (HT) has been one of the most widely used techniques for detecting lines, ellipses and circles. Many derivatives of the classical HT have been introduced specifically to improve its efficiency in ellipse detection. Methods like adaptive HT by Illingworth [1], generalized HT by Ballard [2], randomized HT by Xu et al. [3], dynamic HT by Xie and Ji [4], restricted randomized HT by Cheng and Liu [5], fast graphical ellipse detection (FGED) by Elmowafy and Fairhurst [6] and multipass Hough transform with pyramid image structure by Chien and Cheng [7], have been proposed to reduce the amount of computations and memory requirement while enhancing its accuracy.Genetic algorithm (GA) based ellipse detection techniques are slightly different than the HT in implementation but similar in philosophy. They also use edge pixels on the ellipse contour to calculate and subsequently maximize the fitness of the ellipse [8]. Variations of the GA method for ellipse detection have also been introduced to reduce computation and increase its efficiency and robustness. Examples of improved genetic algorithm methods are Multi Population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA) by Yao, Kharma and Grogono [9], Genetic Algorithm with penalty by Mainzer [10] and Genetic Algorithm with fitness tuning by Lutton and Martinez [8]. The summary of some well-known ellipse detection methods discussed is listed in Table 1.Contour tracing is mainly used for simple object boundary detection and shape classification. Vaddi and Anne [11] proposed an approach for object detection by finding its contour using freeman chain code which is similar to contour tracing. Chang and Chen [12] introduced an algorithm that uses a contour tracing technique to detect the external contour and possible internal contours of objects in binary images. They claimed that their algorithm not only labels components but also extracts component contours and the orders of contour points. Wagenknecht [13] presented a contour tracing and coding algorithm for generating optimized 2D contours from 3D classified objects. Unlike the common pixel-based contour tracing method, the presented method can take into account single pixels and furcation. An ontological representation on coupling active contours was presented in order to understand the scene of multiple non-rigid objects from moving camera. Olszewska and Mccluskey developed an ontology-coupled active contours for dynamic video scene tracking and segmentation by analyzing the object shape and color [14]. The proposed technique in this paper models the Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts as elliptical objects. Edge pixels on the contour of the parasites are detected and evaluated before they are connected together to form an object using contour tracing technique. Then each contour is subjected to certain conditions such as size and square error to certify it as an ellipse before counting. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the methodology of the proposed approach is presented. Steps that are involved in the approach are explained in detail. This is followed by the experimental result section where the performance of the proposed method is discussed and then compared to those of four other methods. Finally, conclusion is drawn and suggestions for future work are given.
