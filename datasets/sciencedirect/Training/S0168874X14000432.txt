@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A nonlinear beam formulation is developed that is suitable to describe adhesion and debonding of thin films. The formulation is based on a shear-flexible, geometrically exact beam theory that allows for large beam deformations. The theory incorporates several aspects that have not been considered in previous theories before. Two different adhesion mechanisms are considered here: adhesion by body forces and adhesion by surface tractions. Corresponding examples are van der Waals adhesion and cohesive zone models. Both mechanisms induce a bending moment within the beam that can play an important role in adhesion and debonding of thin films. The new beam model is discretized within a nonlinear finite element formulation. It is shown that the new formulation leads to a symmetric stiffness matrix for both adhesion mechanisms. The new formulation is used to study the peeling behavior of a gecko spatula. It is shown that the beam model is capable of capturing the main features of spatula peeling accurately, while being much more efficient than 3D solid models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The adhesion, debonding, and peeling behavior of thin strips and films plays an important role in many applications. Examples are paints and coatings, adhesive tapes, liquid films, and adhesive pads of insects and lizards like the gecko spatula pad. Since thin strips are slender, often also elongated, structures they are natural candidates for the consideration of beam theory. This is the basis of several analytical thin film peeling models that have been formulated starting with the seminal work of Kendall [1], see for example [2–5]. Analytical models are based on simplified assumptions regarding geometry and deformation. Thus they are not suitable to describe general problems characterized by the nonlinearities of large deformations and by complex geometries, as they are found in adhesive systems of insects and lizards. In these cases computational models are indispensable.The objective of this paper, therefore, is to formulate a computational beam model for adhesion, debonding, and peeling. Here, we focus on a 2D formulation that is suitable to describe plane strain conditions of films, or to describe 2D behavior of beams. The considered formulation is based on the nonlinear, geometrically exact beam theory of Reissner [6], of which a computational counterpart is discussed in a book by Wriggers [7]. This formulation is generalized to beams with an initially curved axis and an arbitrary shaped cross section, which may vary along the beam. This is also accounted for in the presented contact formulation. The beam model is extended by two different adhesion formulations: adhesion by body forces and adhesion by surface tractions. The first is suitable to describe van der Waals adhesion, the second is suitable to include cohesive zone models. The formulation presented here is an extension of the van der Waals-based beam adhesion formulation of Sauer [8]. The new formulation accounts for both the shear deformation of the beam and a bending moment that is caused by the adhesion forces. Both these contributions have not been incorporated into a computational beam model before. It is seen that, combined, the two contributions lead to a symmetric finite element stiffness matrix. The symmetry is lost if one of the contributions is neglected. This symmetry reflects the fact that the model can be derived from a potential. The computational model presented here has been applied by Sauer [9] for studying the peeling behavior of shear-rigid beams with a rectangular cross section. The purpose of that study was to investigate the material and adhesion properties of thin peeling films, and to show that the bending stiffness can play a major role during peeling. It did, however, neither discuss the computational modeling nor the extension to shear-flexible beams with arbitrary, varying cross sections. This is the purpose of the present work.The major advantage of the new formulation is the huge gain in efficiency it offers compared to adhesion models for 3D solids, like the model of Sauer and Wriggers [10]. To illustrate this, we compare the new beam formulation with the detailed 3D spatula model of Sauer and Holl [11], considering a vibration analysis and several peeling cases. It is seen that the beam model is capable of capturing the behavior of the spatula accurately. For the study, the characteristic beam properties (centroid, cross section, second moment of area, etc.) need to be determined from the detailed 3D geometry, which is discussed in detail. Since a van der Waals-based adhesion model leads to a purely normal (i.e. mode I) contact formulation, we also study gecko adhesion by considering a cohesive zone formulation that can describe tangential (mode II) debonding. In summary, it is shown that the new formulation is (1) more accurate than previous beam formulations, (2) consistent with continuum theory, and (3) a highly efficient alternative to 3D solid models.The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the geometrically exact beam theory and shows how various adhesion formulations are adapted to the beam. Section 3 then presents the corresponding finite element formulation for adhesive beams. Numerical examples are discussed in Section 4. These consider the peeling behavior of a gecko spatula for various loading conditions and compare the beam results with detailed 3D computations based on solid elements. Section 5 concludes this paper.This section presents the model equations governing the mechanical behavior of a thin adhesive strip. We discuss two different continuum adhesion models and their adaption to beam theory, focusing first on the internal work,δΠint, and then on the virtual contact work,δΠc.For adhesion, the (mechanical) weak form of the equilibrium equation is given by the following statement [10]: find an admissible deformationφ∈Usatisfying the principle of virtual work(1)δΠint+δΠc−δΠext=0,∀δφ∈Vφ,whereδφ∈Vφdenotes a kinematically admissible virtual deformation. The first term,δΠint, corresponds to the virtual work of the internal forces, see the following section. The second term,δΠc, which is discussed in Section 2.3, denotes the virtual work of contact and adhesion forces. The last term,δΠext, denotes the virtual work of any external forces acting on the strip.In the following, we outline the kinematics and constitution of the geometrically exact beam formulation of Reissner [6], see also [7]. This formulation accounts for the exact kinematics of large beam deformations and rotations. According to the assumptions of beam theory, only normal strains, due to axial forces and bending moments, and shear strains, due to shear forces, are considered. This means that the beam is supposed to be shear-flexible (like the Timoshenko beam). Further, the cross section of the beam is supposed to remain planar (but not necessarily normal to the beam axis) during deformation. Fig. 1shows the nonlinear kinematics of the deforming beam. As shown, the beam axis is described by the coordinate S in the undeformed reference configuration,B0. The deformation of the beam is fully characterized by the three independent fields u(S), w(S), andψ(S), which denote the displacement of the beam axis and the rotation of the cross section (Fig. 1). The fields can be arranged in the vector(2)d=[uwψ].The deformation of the beam is then characterized by(3)x=[xyθ]=[XYΘ]+[uwψ]=X+d.This formulation corresponds to the global coordinate system shown in Fig. 1. The angleΘcorresponds to the initial inclination of the cross section, which may vary along S but must be perpendicular to the beam axis in the undeformed configuration. This follows from the theory of Reissner. Introducing the rotation(4)Q(θ)=[cosθsinθ0−sinθcosθ0001],the displacement vector,d, can be transformed to the local coordinate systems of the reference configuration,B0, and the current configuration,B, as(5)dLoc≔Q(Θ)danddloc≔Q(θ)d.Note thatQ(θ)=Q(ψ)Q(Θ). For the sake of simplicity, we define a vector of partial derivatives,d′≔∂d/∂S. Introducing the transformations(6)dLoc′≔Q(Θ)d′anddloc′≔Q(θ)d′,the axial strain, ε, the shear strain, γ, and the flexure, κ, of the beam, arranged in the vectorε=[ε,γ,κ]T, can be either written as [7](7)ε=Q(ψ)dLoc′−ϕor equivalently as(8)ε=dloc′−ϕ,whereϕis defined as(9)ϕ=[1−cosψsinψ0].Expression (8) provides a geometrically exact definition of the beam strains w.r.t. the local coordinate system. The strain definition according to Eq. (8) is the logical extension of the infinitesimal beam kinematics to large deformations and rotations.The local axial force, N, shear force, V, and bending moment, M, of the beam follow from the chosen constitutive model. Here, we consider linear elastic material behavior, so the cross-sectional forceS=[N,V,M]Tis given by(10)S=Dεwith(11)D=[EA000GAs000EI].The diagonal entries ofDdescribe the axial, shear, and bending stiffness of the beam. Here, E and G denote Young׳s modulus and the shear modulus. Further, A and I denote the cross section area and second moment of area. In general, these may change along the beam axis.Asdenotes the shear-corrected cross section area, which isAs=5/6Afor a rectangular andAs=9/10Afor a circular cross section. In general, it can be obtained from Eq. (104), discussed in Appendix C. A linear material model, like (10), is acceptable as long as the strains ε and γ remain small. The displacements themselves can become arbitrarily large. The internal virtual work,δΠint, is given by the virtual work done by the sectional forces,S, integrated along the undeformed beam axis, i.e.(12)δΠint=∫LδεTSdS.Here,δεdenotes the virtual strains, which are obtained from Eq. (8) as(13)δε=Q(θ)δd′+[∂Q(ψ)∂ψQ(Θ)d′−∂ϕ∂ψ]δψ.Carrying out the differentiation, this can be written as(14)δε=δdloc′+Aδdloc,with(15)A=[00wloc′−sinψ00−uloc′−cosψ000]and(16)δdloc≔Q(θ)δd,δdloc′≔Q(θ)δd′.This section discusses the formulation of adhesive contact, considering either bulk adhesion or adhesion by surface tractions. For both, the substrate is supposed to be much stiffer than the peeling strip, such that the deformation of the substrate can be omitted.In the case of adhesion by body forces we have [10](17)δΠc=−∫B0δφ·β0b¯cdV,whereβ0b¯cdVdenotes an infinitesimal force acting on the undeformed volume elementdV. The term β0 describes the particle density ofdV. For van der Waals adhesion, the body forcesbc≔β0b¯ccan be derived from the Lennard-Jones potential considering analytical half-space integration [10]. This gives(18)bc=bc(r)np,bc(r)=AH2πr04[15(r0r)10−(r0r)4],where r0 denotes the equilibrium distance of the Lennard-Jones potential andAHdenotes the Hamaker constant. According to Eq. (18),bcis parallel to the normal vector,np, of the substrate surface,∂Bs. The body force field, given in Eq. (18), needs to be integrated over the height of the beam. This leads to a distributed line force,Tc, and bending moment,Mc, acting along the beam axis as shown in Fig. 2. We assume in the following that the initial inclination of the beam axis,Θ, is approximately equal to the inclination of∂Bs. By choice, the substrate is oriented such thatΘ=0. The left hand side of Fig. 2 shows the beam in a general configuration. The integration is performed over an infinitesimal slice of the beam cross section, which is rotated by the angle ψ.11Due to the shear deformation of the beam, ψ is not equal to the rotation of its lower surface.The right hand side of Fig. 2 shows the undeformed configuration of the cross section slice considered at the same positionu=[u,w]Tand rotation ψ as the deformed slice. The infinitesimal volume element,dV, can be written as(19)dV=WdrdScosψ,wheredSis the thickness of the cross section slice,dris a differential element alongnp, and W is the width of the beam. In general, W may vary along both r and S. Nevertheless, since the force field (18) decays very fast for increasing distance [10] we consider the width of the lower strip surface here,W=W(S). IntegratingbcWalong r gives(20)T^c≈W∫r1r2bc(r)dr,with(21)r1(ψ)=rM−H2cosψ,r2(ψ)=rM+H2cosψ,according to Fig. 2. The termH=H(S)is the strip height at S, see Remark 1. The integral is easily evaluated as(22)T^c=T(r1)−T(r2),with(23)T(r)=AHW2πr03[145(r0r)9−13(r0r)3].For convenience, the quantities(24)Tc≔T^ccosψand(25)Tc≔Tcnpare introduced. Thus one can write(26)∫B0bcdV≈∫LTcdSfor the beam. As seen, the sectional rotation, ψ, leads to an increase of the distributed line force,Tc. Due to the inclination of the slice, the adhesion forces induce a bending moment,Mc, as shown in the figure. It is caused by the eccentricity,e=(rM−r)tanψ, of the body force field, which is not uniform across the height of the beam. Integrating the productebcWalong r then defines the moment(27)Mc≈W∫r1r2(rM−r)tanψbc(r)cosψdr.Evaluating the integral yields(28)Mc≔(rMT^c−r0Tc⁎)tanψcosψ,with(29)Tc⁎=W∫r1r2rbc(r)dr=T⁎(r1)−T⁎(r2)and(30)T⁎(r)=AHW2πr03[140(r0r)8−12(r0r)2].Altogether, it is seen that due to the inclination of the beam, three effects have appeared:1.An increase of the adhesion force,Tc, by the factor1/cosψ, which has the same effect as an actual increase of the film density,an additional bending moment,Mc, anda coupling between the adhesion forces and the shear deformation, γ, via the angle ψ appearing in Eq. (8). This last contribution will lead to a fully symmetric finite element tangent matrix as seen in Section 3.The virtual contact work,δΠc, now corresponds to the virtual work done by the sectional force,Tc, and sectional moment,Mc, distributed along the beam, i.e.(31)δΠc=−∫LδdT[TcMc]dS.If no external forces are considered, as is done in the examples of the following sections,22We thus ignore the self-weight of the beam.the external virtual work is zero, i.e.δΠext=0. Together with Eq. (12), the weak form governing the beam is then given by(32)∫LδεTSdS−∫L(δu·Tc+δψ·Mc)dS=0,∀δd∈Vd,where[δuT,δψ]=δdT.Remarks:1.Due to the fast decay of T(r) from Eq. (23) it is convenient to setr2→∞if the considered strip is thicker than a few nanometers [9]. The line force,Tc, and moment,Mc, then simplify due toT^c=T(r1)andTc⁎=T⁎(r1).For an initially stress-free configuration, the lower strip surface must be separated from the substrate either byr=∞or by the equilibrium distance,req, for which the traction is zero,Tc(req)=0. Considering Remark 1, this distance can be easily derived from Eq. (23);req=r0/156[9].Numerical ill-conditioning forr→0, where the contact force approaches infinity, can be avoided by regularizing contact formulations (24) and (28). Here, the slopes ofTcandMcare limited to a certain threshold, see Appendix A.A partial increase or decrease of adhesion (e.g. due to varying chemical properties along the strip) can be considered easily by varying the Hamaker constant,AH≥0, along S. Note that in an efficient computational framework, contact should be evaluated only for the adhesive part of the strip, whereAH>0, see Section 3.3.The formulation presented here can also be applied to arbitrary contact laws defined by a body force functionbc(r).In the case of adhesion by surface tractions we consider [12](33)δΠc=−∫∂B0δφ·FcdA.Now,FcdAcorresponds to an infinitesimal force acting on the undeformed surface elementdA. Examples for surface adhesion are cohesive zone models, e.g. [13,14](34)Fc=−F0g0exp(1−∥gs∥g0)gs,where F0 and g0 are constants, and where(35)gs=xs−xp0is the gap vector between the surface pointxs∈∂Band a specific reference pointxp0on the substrate surface that could for instance be the initial projection point ofxs. The line force,(36)Tc≔FcW,leads to a sectional bending moment as is shown in Fig. 3. Defining the sectional basis vectorss≔[cosψ,sinψ]Tandh=[−sinψ,cosψ]T=∂s/∂ψatx, one determines the surface location(37)xs=x−H2h,evaluatesTc=Tc(gs)from Eqs. (36) and (35), and obtains the bending moment as(38)Mc=H2s·Tc.This bending moment is not only an effect of the section inclination, as in the bulk adhesion model considered in Section 2.3.1, but is also caused by the tangential component ofTc. The virtual contact work and the governing weak form remain as they are given in Eqs. (31) and (32), now considering the new expressions forTcandMc. Like in the model for bulk adhesion, the presented surface adhesion model leads to a symmetric finite element tangent matrix, see Section 3.Remarks:1.The cohesive zone model (36) is unstable for compression due to the absence of any stabilizing forces perpendicular togs. In order to stabilize compression, a penalty regularization can be used here.In principle, also other surface adhesion laws can be considered instead of Eq. (36).The beam formulation outlined above is now discretized in the framework of the finite element method.The beam is discretized intonelfinite elements. Within each finite beam element, Ωe, the initial position,X, and the displacement,d, are approximated independently by the interpolations(39)Xh=[XhYhΘh]=∑I=1nNIXI,dh=[uhwhψh]=∑I=1nNIdI.Here,(40)XI=[XIYIΘI],dI=[uIwIψI]denote the axis position/inclination at the finite element nodes as well as the unknown displacement/rotation values. In short, we also write(41)Xh=NeXeanddh=Nede.Here,Ne=[N1I,N2I,…,NnI]is an array containing n shape functions, NI, associated with the n nodes of element Ωe, and(42)Xe=[X1X2⋮Xn]andde=[d1d2⋮dn]are the vectors of the nodal initial positions and unknown displacements of the element. The beam geometry w.r.t. the current configuration then reads(43)xh=Xh+dh.For simplicity, superscript h is dropped in the following. The components ofdare transformed to the local coordinate systems according to Eq. (5). We note that here, in general, bothdand θ are interpolated quantities. The partial derivatived′is then given by(44)d′=Ne′de,where(45)Ne′≔∂Ne∂S=∂Ne∂ξ(∂S∂ξ)−1.The derivative∂S/∂ξis discussed in Section 3.4. The transformation ofd′is obtained by inserting Eq. (44) into definition (6), i.e.(46)dloc′≔Q(θ)d′=Q(θ)Ne′de.The virtual displacement field,δd, considering the same interpolation as in (41), is written as(47)δd=Neδde,where the arrangement ofδdeis analogous to (42) and (40). According to (16) we then have(48)δdloc≔Q(θ)Neδde,δdloc′≔Q(θ)Ne′δde.Given the FE interpolation defined above, we now proceed with the treatment of the internal virtual work (12). Inserting (48) into (14) yields(49)δεe=Beδde,withBe=[B1,B2,…,Bn]and, due to the sparseness ofA,(50)BI=NI′Q(θ)+NIA.In an actual implementationBIshould be multiplied out for efficiency, giving(51)BI=[NI′cosθNI′sinθNI(wloc′−sinψ)−NI′sinθNI′cosθ−NI(uloc′+cosψ)00NI′].With (49), the internal virtual work of element Ωebecomes, according to (12),δΠinte=δdeTfinte, wherefinteis the internal force vector of the element that is given by(52)finte=∫LeBeTSdS.In this form, the components offinteare given in the global basis. Here, the sectional force vectorSis specified through Eqs. (10), (8), (46), (9) and (41). The stiffness matrix,kinte, that is associated withfinte, and which is needed for the solution procedure discussed in Section 3.5, can be found in Appendix B.1.Remarks:1.Alternatively, the strain operator matrixBIcan be formulated w.r.t. the local coordinate system in the initial configuration, i.e. in direction ofuLocandwLoc. We find(53)BI=BLocIQ(Θ)withBLocI≔NI′Q(ψ)+NIALocand(54)ALoc=[00−(1+uLoc′)sinψ+wLoc′cosψ00−(1+uLoc′)cosψ−wLoc′sinψ000].These expressions are identical to Eqs. (15) and (51). For the internal force vector of finite element Ωefollows(55)finte=∑I=1nfintIe,fintIe=∫LeQT(Θ)BLocITSdS.If only infinitesimal deformations occur,ddoes not affect the strain operator matrixBe. Consideringu′⪡1,w′⪡1, andψ⪡1(so thatθ≈Θ) we thus find the linearized strain operator(56)BIlin=NI′Q(Θ)+NIAlin,and(57)Alin=[00000−1000].For beams with varying cross section, the interpolation of the cross-sectional properties A, I, W, and H is analogous to interpolation (41).An alternative FE description is obtained if we first rotate the nodal displacement vectors into the local reference coordinate system, i.e.(58)dLocI=Q(ΘI)dI,and then consider the FE interpolation there, i.e.(59)dLoc=∑I=1nNIdLocI,dLoc′=∑I=1nNI′dLocI.(Here, we still considerdLoc=Q(ψh)dLoc.)In this caseBIturns intoBI=BLocIQ(ΘI), so that Eq. (55) simplifies to the formulation discussed in the book by Wriggers [7](60)finte=∑I=1nfintIe,fintIe=QT(ΘI)∫LeBLocITSdS.Inserting interpolation (47) into (31), lets us write the virtual contact work for finite elementΩce,e=1,…,nce, asδΠce=δdeTfce, where(61)fce=−∫LeNeT[TcMc]dSdenotes the elemental contact force vector. Here,nceis the number of elements whereAH>0, see Remark 4 of Section 2.3.1. The tangent matrix associated withfceis given by(62)kce=∂fce∂de=[∂fce∂u∂fce∂ψ]Ne,which yields(63)kce=−∫LeNeT[∂Tc∂u∂Tc∂ψ∂Mc∂u∂Mc∂ψ]NedS.The individual terms are discussed below. It is shown thatkceis fully symmetric. Due to the strong variation ofTcandMc,fceandkceare integrated to high accuracy by using several quadrature points, see Section 3.4.We first consider the formulation of Section 2.3.1, whereTcandMcare given by Eqs. (25) and (28). Introducing the abbreviation(…)′=∂(…)/∂rM, considering thatδu=δx, and noting that∂rM/∂x=np, the first two submatrices from Eq. (63) are readily obtained as(64)∂Tc∂u=Tc′np⊗npand∂Tc∂ψ=[Tc+H2Td′]tanψnp,where we have definedTd≔T(r1)+T(r2). The third submatrix simply is(65)∂Mc∂u=[∂Tc∂ψ]T.The last piece, the derivative of the contact moment w.r.t. inclination ψ, is found as(66)∂Mc∂ψ=H2[rMTd′−r0Td⁎′]tan2ψ+Mc1+sin2ψsinψcosψ,where we have introducedTd⁎≔T⁎(r1)+T⁎(r2). With these expressions, the tangent matrixkcebecomes fully symmetric, as it should, since the adhesion forces can be derived from a potential. Both the proof of symmetry and the derivation ofTc′,Td′, andTd⁎′are discussed in Appendix B.2. If the bending moment,Mc, is neglected, the symmetry ofkceis lost, which essentially implies an inconsistency of the formulation. Nothing is gained from this approximation. We note that in the initial configurationψ=0, so that one hasMc=0,∂Mc/∂u=0, and∂Mc/∂ψ=rMT^c−r0Tc⁎.Secondly, we consider the formulation of Section 2.3.2, whereTcandMcare given by Eqs. (36) and (38). The first entry inkcecan now be written as(67)∂Tc∂u=∂Tc∂gs∂gs∂x=∂Tc∂gs,since∂gs/∂x=Iaccording to Eqs. (35) and (37). WritingTc=Tcg¯swithg¯s=gs/gsandgs=∥gs∥, and settingTc′≔∂Tc/∂gswe can then find(68)∂Tc∂gs=Tc′g¯s⊗g¯s+Tcgs(I−g¯s⊗g¯s),see [14]. With this, the second entry inkcecan be easily found as(69)∂Tc∂ψ=∂Tc∂gs∂gs∂ψ,where(70)∂gs∂ψ=H2s,according to Eqs. (35) and (37). It is also easy to see that(71)∂Mc∂x=H2s·∂Tc∂gs=[∂Tc∂ψ]T,caused by the symmetry of∂Tc/∂gs. The last entry inkceis also simple to evaluate; we find(72)∂Mc∂ψ=H2h·Tc+H24s·∂Tc∂gss.As in the above case,kceturns out to be fully symmetric – again a consequence of the fact that the formulation is derivable from a potential. The symmetry is lost ifMcis neglected.The integrals appearing infinte,fce,kinte, andkceare evaluated by using numerical quadrature on the master domainξ∈[−1,1]. The element configuration is therefore mapped onto this master configuration by considering the transformation(73)dS=S,ξdξ,where(…),ξis shorthand for the derivative∂(…)/∂ξ. According to (39), the axial coordinate, S, is interpolated in the same way as the displacement field,d, so that(74)S,ξ=∑I=1nNI,ξSI.For linear elements with n=2 nodes, considered in the examples below, the Jacobians are constant and given asS,ξ=Le/2, where Leis the element length in initial configuration. Using numerical quadrature, the integrals are then rewritten as(75)∫Lef(S)dS=∫−11f(ξ)S,ξdξ≈∑qp=1nqpf(ξqp)S,ξ(ξqp)wqp,where ξqpare appropriate quadrature points with the weights wqp. In order to avoid shear locking we use reduced integration for the internal force and stiffness, e.g.ngp=1for linear elements [7]. The contact integrals, on the other hand, are integrated with several quadrature points, e.g.nqpc=5, due to the strong nonlinearities of the considered adhesion formulations.The elemental force vectors,finteandfce, are assembled into the global vectors,fintandfc. After accounting for the essential boundary conditions ond(i.e. the vector of all nodal unknownsdI), we are left with the FE equilibrium equation(76)f(d)=fint+fc=0.Relation (76) is a system of nonlinear equations, which must be linearized by using e.g. Newton׳s method. The tangent matrix,k=kint+kc, required for this method is assembled from the elemental contributions,kinteandkce, provided in Section 3.3 and Appendix B.1. At every Newton step we then need to solve the linear system(77)kΔd+f=0,for the new displacement increment,Δd. A summary of the complete finite element algorithm is given in Table 1.This section discusses a simple test case in order to perform a convergence study for the FE beam model. In addition, the results are compared to both an analytical [9] and a 2D finite element [15] adhesion model. A thin strip with rectangular cross section is considered. In the initial state, 75% of its lower surface(0≤S≤0.75L)adhere to a planar and rigid substrate. The strip is peeled off the substrate by rotating the right boundary byψ|S=L=ψb. The length and thickness are taken asL=200nmandH=10nm. The width, W, and Young׳s modulus, E, are used for normalization and remain unspecified. Considering the van der Waals model, the parametersAH=10−19Jandr0=0.4nmare chosen. Poisson׳s ratio is assumed to beν=0.2.We now consider the bending moment,M, which is required to maintain the prescribed rotation, as well as the internal energy(78)Πint=12∫LεTSdS,forψb=150°. We obtainM(ψb)=1.5976EW3andΠint(ψb)=2.0736EW3fornel=6400elements andnqpc=5quadrature points per contact element. As Fig. 4a and b shows, both quantities converge for increasing numbers of finite elements and contact quadrature points. (Because of the shear locking effects discussed in Section 3.4, the numerical quadrature of the internal forces is not refined here.) The bending radius of the strip,R0=κ−1, is measured asR0=5.2176H.For pure bending, the quantitiesMand R0 can be derived analytically [9] as(79)M=EWH2wadh6EH,R0=HEH24wadh.The termwadhdenotes the work of adhesion, which is given for the total detachment process bywadh=153AH/(16πr02)[9]. This yieldsM=1.5986EW3andR0=5.2130H, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. Small differences are to be expected here because the assumption of pure bending made for the analytical solution is not valid close to the peeling zone of the strip. A detailed 2D finite element analysis by Sauer [15] provides a bending moment ofM=1.642EW3. This value is very close to the result obtained with the beam model. The difference between both solutions is a consequence of the different models. The 2D model differs from the beam model in the assumptions of nonlinear (Neo-Hookean) elasticity and the independence of the contact traction from the strip inclination, ψ.The beam model discussed in the previous sections is now used to model the peeling process of a gecko spatula.33The spatulae form the tips of the fine hairs (setae) covering the gecko toes.A detailed 3D finite element model of a single spatula is provided by Sauer and Holl [11]. On the basis of this model, we generate a reduced beam geometry that has the same cross-sectional properties as the 3D model, but requires significantly less degrees of freedoms. Besides the continuum model, we also re-examine the previous spatula beam model of Sauer [8], which considers both a simplified geometry and contact formulation. The three different models are compared by performing a vibration and peeling analysis.In the following, we useL0=1nmfor normalization. As shown in Fig. 5, the 3D spatula geometry of Sauer and Holl [11] consists of a cylindrical shaft, which ends in a flat, triangular pad. While the pad itself is very thin, its rim is significantly thicker. The geometry is symmetric w.r.t. the (X,Y)-plane, see Fig. 5.Although its shape is three-dimensional, we assume here that the attachment and peeling of the spatula can be described within the plane of symmetry. We thus reduce the 3D solid model to a two-dimensional beam model by defining the axis, S, within this plane as shown in Fig. 5. The cross section properties, A and I, are obtained according to the procedure outlined in Table 2.For the spatial discretization of the beam model, we follow the approach of Sauer and Holl [11] who have used a coarse finite element mesh for the spatula branch and a fine mesh for the pad. Here, elements of length2L0for the branch and approx.1/3L0for the pad are used. We reduce with the chosen mesh the number of degrees of freedom from approx. 420,000 to 4000, i.e. by approximately 99%.In Fig. 6a, the position of the beam axis in the (X,Y)-plane is visualized. The spatula shaft is initially inclined byΘ≈5○. Fig. 6b shows the width of the adhesive spatula pad for the present and the previously studied [8] beam model. The pad widths differ substantially at the connection between pad and shaft (forX<100L0). The enclosed area,(80)Ac≔∫LcW(S)dS,defines the contact surface area of the adhesive pad. Here,Lcdenotes the length of the adhesive part. The contact areaAcagrees well for the two models, as Table 3shows.Fig. 6c and d shows the cross section area, A, and the second moment of area w.r.t. the beam axis, I, for both models. The figure shows that there are very large differences between the two beam models, especially in the transition zone between the spatula pad and the shaft. The quantities are normalized by the maximum valuesAmax=A|S=0andImax=I|S=0occurring at the base of the spatula shaft.AmaxandImaxare specified in Table 3.For the beam model, the effective cross-sectional shear area,As, needs to be specified. Here, we consider a shear area ofAs=5/6A, see Appendix C. Following Sauer and Holl [11], we choose the parameters E=2GPa,ν=0.2,AH=10−19J, andr0=0.4nm. Note that in the previous study [11], a Neo-Hooke material behavior has been considered for the 3D spatula. For the sake of comparability, we also consider a Saint Venant–Kirchhoff material model here: this model shows – like our beam model – a linear stress–strain relation, but a geometrically nonlinear behavior.In the following, we compare the vibration characteristics of the three different spatula models by performing a modal analysis. For this purpose, we clamp the spatula at the shaft boundary,d|S=0=0, and consider the eigenvalue problem(81)(klin−ωi2m)ϑi=0,wheremis the mass matrix given in Appendix B.3, andklinis the linearized stiffness matrix.44We obtainklinby following Appendix B.1 withBIlinfrom Eq. (56) andCIJ=0.ϑiand ωicorrespond to the characteristic displacement and frequency of the ith eigenmode.Table 4shows the first ten eigenfrequencies obtained with the 3D solid spatula model in comparison to the reduced beam model presented here. The eigenfrequencies for the previous spatula model of Sauer [8] are listed for the sake of completeness. The termebeamdenotes the relative error,55Note that the eigenvalues according to the solid model may still be subject to significant discretization errors.ebeam=|ωbeam−ωsolid|/ωsolid. The corresponding displacements are shown in Fig. 7. For both the continuum and the beam model we obtain the first seven bending modes and the first longitudinal mode of the spatula, see Table 4 and Fig. 7. The torsional modes,ϑ5andϑ9, observed for the solid model cannot be obtained with a two-dimensional model. These modes are anyway not relevant for peeling in the (X,Y)-plane.The first eigenmodes of the present beam model agree well with the results obtained with the solid model. It is seen in Fig. 7 that the nodes of vibrations occur at the same locations for both spatula models. Regarding both the first bending and longitudinal modes,ϑ1andϑ6, the natural frequencies differ in less than 1%, see Table 4. All other errors are less than 10%. The large error in the fourth bending mode,ϑ4, may be caused by significant torsional deformation observed for the mode of the solid model (Fig. 7). We can conclude that our beam model is able to accurately capture the mechanical behavior of the considered structure.In this section, the peeling behavior of the three spatula models is compared by considering the van der Waals model and by studying peeling due to bending and vertical loading. In addition, we investigate peeling due to horizontal loading, using the cohesive zone formulation described in Section 2.3.2.First, the spatula is peeled from a flat and rigid substrate by rotating the base of the spatula shaft byψ|S=0=ψb.66From the chosen orientation of the beam axis followsψ|S=0<0. For convenience, however, the sign is omitted in the following.The horizontal and vertical degrees of freedom remain unconstrained at this point. Fig. 8a shows the resulting bending moment for the solid model of Sauer and Holl [11], the present beam model, and the simplified beam model of Sauer [8]. For small inclinations, the peeling behavior of the present beam model agrees well with the results of Sauer and Holl [11]. At the beginning of the peeling process, the bending moment increases rapidly for both considered models and reaches its maximum at similar shaft inclinations, see Table 5. We observe that the moment drops due to a system instability when the first part of the pad (atS≈0.72LorX≈80L0) is peeled from the substrate. Here, the spatula cross section changes remarkably, see Fig. 6c and d. After the drop-off, the beam model produces a larger moment than the solid model. This may be caused by the axis inclination at the rim, which is not accounted for in our adhesion formulation. Regarding the solid spatula, the peeling behavior is very similar for the two considered material models. This observation confirms our assumption of large deformations but small strains.It is important to note that the detachment behavior of the spatula beam model strongly depends on how the tip of the adhesive pad is modeled. Considering the adhesive pad surface shown in Fig. 6b, the spatula can be rotated byψb=136°, which is larger than for the solid model. Fig. 8a shows that the beam model of the spatula detaches quite earlier if we consider e.g. a small part of the spatula tip (X>340L0in Fig. 6b orS>0.98L0in Fig. 6c) as non-adhesive.77The adhesive area thus decreases toAc=47,385L02, i.e. by 3.9%.We discuss the adjustment of the adhesive pad surface in the following section.In contrast to the other spatula models, the bending moment observed for the previous beam model [8] is considerably lower. After reachingM≈200EL03, the bending moment increases only slightly, see Fig. 8a. Compared with the other models, the spatula shaft has a very high bending resistance, while the bending stiffness of the pad is almost negligible (Fig. 6d). For this reason, the spatula pad accommodates most of the deformation. The observation that the bending moment is small for this model illustrates that the thicker rim of the spatula pad contributes significantly to the spatula strength.After rotating the shaft to an inclination ofθ|S=0=60°(ψb=55°), the spatula pulled upward by an imposed displacement along the Y-direction:w|S=0=wrot+wbandψ|S=0=ψb. The termwrotdenotes the vertical displacement caused by the pre-rotation. Fig. 8b shows the peeling reaction forces obtained for the three spatula models. In contrast to the previous beam model, the new beam model behaves very similarly to the solid model; the reaction force increases almost linearly for displacements smaller than120L0. Forwb≥120L0, only a small part of the spatula pad adheres to the substrate. Here, the new beam model is slightly softer as the reaction force is smaller. The differences at the end of the detachment process are due to the fact that a beam theory is not applicable for the tip of the spatula pad. The solid model detaches earlier atwb=184L0, when approx. 10% of the spatula pad remain attached to the substrate. For the beam model, approx. 6% of the pad adhere to the substrate at full detachment (wb=205.5L0). We therefore adjust the size of the adhesive pad for the beam model according to Section 4.3.1. Then, both the maximum force and the prescribed displacement at full detachment agree very well for both models, see Fig. 8b and Table 6. Regarding the beam model of Sauer [8], the peeling reaction force is significantly larger, see Fig. 8b and Table 6. We can conclude that, in contrast to the previous beam model, the reduced beam model compares well with the 3D continuum model.We now consider four different states of the peeling process, which are also marked as black diamonds in Fig. 8a and b:1.Shaft rotation byψb=26°(θ|S=0=31°): location of the system instability.2.Shaft rotation byψb=55°(θ|S=0=60°): start of vertical peeling.3.Vertical displacement bywb=60L0: atθ|S=0=60°.4.Vertical displacement bywb=120L0: atθ|S=0=60°.Fig. 9a and b shows the contact traction and moment as well as the components of the force resultant,S, for the four configurations.The peeling front of the spatula pad becomes apparent as a sharp spike in the contact traction and moment (whereTc<0andMc>0). The remaining part of the pad (whereTc>0andMc<0) is pressed into the substrate due to the bending resistance of the spatula. Fig. 10shows the corresponding spatula deformations for both the beam model and the 3D solid model.The stress shown for the solid model is the first invariantI1=trσnormalized by Young׳s modulusE. For the beam model we have visualized the stress(σ1+σ2)/E, with(82)σ1=NA+MI·H2andσ2=−1Wmin(Tc,0),here σ1 is the usual normal stress for beams due to axial forces and bending. The term σ2 contains the adhesive traction at the lower pad surface. Although it is not accounted for in beam theory, it can indicate the current position of the peeling front. As one can see in Fig. 10, both the spatula deformation and the internal stresses,trσand σ1, are very close for the two models. In addition, the peeling front occurs at the same location. This shows that the beam model is capable of capturing the peeling behavior of the spatula accurately even though it contains 90-times less degrees of freedom. Note that a more comprehensive study, discussing vertical peeling of a spatula for different pre-rotations, can be found in [11] for the 3D solid model.This section investigates the influence of both the shear flexibility of the beam and the bending moment,Mc, caused by adhesion, see Eq. (27). For this purpose, we study the peeling processes discussed in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 for(1)a large shear modulus (G→∞) andthe assumption that the contact moment is negligible,Mc=0.We note that the assumptionGAs→∞leads to the Bernoulli beam formulation. Here, we increaseGby the factor 1000. Fig. 11shows the bending moment and peeling force for the two modified formulations compared to the original beam formulation. Neglecting the contact moment,Mc, results in smaller values for the applied peeling moment,M(ψb), and peeling force,P(wb). This is also seen in Table 7. In this case the spatula detaches earlier from the substrate than for the original model.The influence of the shear flexibility becomes most apparent for large spatula deformations, see e.g.ψb=29°in Fig. 11a. Nevertheless, spatula peeling is mainly characterized by axial and bending deformation. The results show that both quantities affect the peeling behavior of the spatula. Combined together, they lead to a symmetric finite element tangent matrix,k, which may accelerate the solution of the linear system (77).Finally, we study the detachment behavior of the spatula for horizontal peeling. The base of the spatula shaft, rotated byψb=55°, is now loaded by a prescribed horizontal displacement in the positive and negative X-direction,u|S=0=urot+ubandψ|S=0=ψb. In the previous examples, friction had been omitted as it does not play any significant role for vertical loading [11]. For horizontal loading, however, the peeling behavior depends strongly on the friction behavior between the pad and the substrate. To model tangential debonding we consider the cohesive zone formulation discussed in Section 2.3.2. The parameters F0 and g0 are chosen such that, regarding the vertical direction, the cohesive zone model shows a peeling behavior similar to the van der Waals model. Here, the maximum adhesion force and the total contact energy should agree for both models. This yields(83)F0=−1WT(r0/56)andg0=wadhF0exp(1),where the work of adhesion,wadh, is specified in Section 3.6. This choice results in a cohesive zone model that behaves almost identically to the van der Waals model during vertical peeling (where the tangential contact forces absent in the van der Waals model play no role). This is shown in Fig. 12a. In Fig. 12b and c, the reaction force due to horizontal peeling is shown. The peeling behavior of the spatula depends strongly on the peeling direction. This is in agreement with the experimental observations of Autumn et al. [16]. Fig. 13shows the deformed beam for different horizontal displacements. When the spatula is moved to the left, the adhesive spatula pad is pressed into the substrate, which causes large reaction forces, see Fig. 12b. For displacements in the positive X-direction, the pad curls up, which decreases the remaining contact area significantly. For this reason, the maximum reaction force is much smaller than for vertical peeling. Considering E=2GPa andL0=1nm, the horizontal detachment forces arePmax,l≈300nNandPmax,r≈6nN, a difference of 50.
