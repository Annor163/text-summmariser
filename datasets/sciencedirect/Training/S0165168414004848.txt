@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Multimodulus algorithms (MMA) based adaptive blind equalizers mitigate inter-symbol interference in a digital communication system by minimizing dispersion in the quadrature components of the equalized sequence in a decoupled manner, i.e., the in-phase and quadrature components of the equalized sequence are used to minimize dispersion in the respective components of the received signal. These unsupervised equalizers are mostly incorporated in bandwidth-efficient digital receivers (wired, wireless or optical) which rely on quadrature amplitude modulation based signaling. These equalizers are equipped with nonlinear error-functions in their update expressions which makes it a challenging task to evaluate analytically their steady-state performance. However, exploiting variance relation theorem, researchers have recently been able to report approximate expressions for steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) of such equalizers for noiseless but interfering environment.In this work, in contrast to existing results, we present exact steady-state tracking analysis of two multimodulus equalizers in a non-stationary environment. Specifically, we evaluate expressions for steady-state EMSE of two equalizers, namely the MMA2-2 and the βMMA. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is validated using different set experiments and found in close agreement.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Transmission of signals between a transmitter and a receiver in a communication system encounters different types of dispersive channels. Such channels perform certain non-ideal transformations resulting in different types of interferences like inter-symbol interference (ISI) and frequency selective fading, which are considered to be the biggest limiting factors in a communication system. One of the approaches to combat ISI is to use blind equalizer. An adaptive blind equalizer attempts to compensate for the distortions of the channel by processing the received signals and reconstructing the transmitted signal up to some indeterminacies by the use of linear or nonlinear filters. Specifically, a blind equalizer does not require any training mode and tries to mitigate the effects of the channel solely on the basis of probabilistic and statistical properties of the transmitted data sequence. The basic idea behind an adaptive blind equalizer is to minimize or maximize some admissible blind objective or cost function through the choice of filter coefficients based on the equalizer output [1–3].When an adaptive equalizer is used to combat a time-varying channel, the optimum Wiener solution takes time-varying form which results in variation of saddle point in error performance surface. If the underlying signal statistics happen to change with time, then these statistical variations will be reflected in the data, the filter has access to, which in turn will be reflected in the performance of filters. So, tracking variations in signal statistics or signal moments is considered to be a useful property for adaptive filters. For adaptive filters, the variation in underlying signal statistics and the saddle point can be tracked by using tracking performance analysis; and consequently, the filter parameters can be adjusted accordingly to maintain the saddle points of error performance surface and to calculate the variations in underlying signal statistics in time-varying systems. One metric to evaluate tracking performance of an adaptive filter is to measure the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE). EMSE can be defined as the difference between the mean square error (MSE) of the filter in steady-state and the minimum cost. The smaller the EMSE of an adaptive filter, the better it is [4]. If filter parameters (like step-size) are chosen correctly, the filter can track variations in signal statistics provided variations are not fast. However, tracking fast variations in signal statistics might be a challenging task or at times impossible to perform [4].In the context of adaptive blind equalization, the widely adopted algorithm is Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA2-2) [2,5–7]. For quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signaling, however, a tailored version of CMA2-2, commonly known as Multimodulus Algorithm (MMA2-2), is considered to be more suitable. The MMA2-2 is capable of jointly achieving blind equalization and carrier phase recovery [8–13], whereas the CMA2-2 requires a separate phase-lock loop for carrier phase recovery.The nonlinearity of most of the adaptive equalizers, including both CMA2-2 and MMA2-2, makes the steady-state analysis and tracking performance a difficult task to perform. As a result, only a small number of analyses are available in the literature concerning the steady-state analysis performance of adaptive equalizers. However, a few results are available on EMSE analysis of CMA2-2, where some researchers employed Lyapunov stability and averaging analysis [14], and some exploited the variance relation theorem [15,16] to evaluate the same. The steady-state analysis of adaptive filters has gained interest due to ease in analysis owing to variance relation theorem. Abrar et al. [17] performed the EMSE analysis of CMA2-2 and βCMA [18] by assuming that the modulus of equalized signals is Rician distributed in the steady-state. Moreover, this theorem has been employed to study the steady-state analysis of a number of adaptive blind equalization algorithms like in the analyses of the so-called hybrid algorithm [19], the square contour algorithm [20], the improved square contour algorithm [21] and the varying-modulus algorithms [22].In this paper, we perform tracking performance analysis of two well-known multimodulus equalizers. In particular, using the variance relation arguments, we derive expressions for steady-state EMSE of MMA2-2 and recently proposed βMMA [23] under the assumption that the quadrature components of the successfully equalized signal are Gaussian distributed when conditioned on true signal alphabets. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the mathematical model for the system. Section 3 introduces the non-stationary environment and the framework for EMSE analyses. Section 3.1 provides the steady-state tracking performance analysis for MMA2-2 equalizer. Section 3.2 presents the analytical expression evaluated for steady-state tracking performance analysis for βMMA equalizer. Section 4 provides simulation results for steady-state performances of MMA2-2 and βMMA for equalized zero-forcing scenario, equalization of fixed and time-varying channels, and equalization under different values of filter-length. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.A typical baseband communication system is given in Fig. 1. Consider the transmission of discrete valued complex sequence{an}over an unknown communication channel characterized by finite impulse response filter with impulse responsehn; the sequence{an}is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and takes value of square-QAM symbols with equal probability. The considered channelhnis a fading, dispersive, time-varying in nature, where the channel at index n is given ashn=hconst+cn. The channel is a complex Gaussian random process with a constant meanhconst(because of shadowing, reflections and large scale path loss) and a time-variant partcn, the channel taps vary from symbol to symbol and are modeled as mutually uncorrelated circular complex Gaussian random processes. The time-varying part of the channel can be modeled by a pth-order autoregressive process AR(p).The received signal xnis the convolution of transmitted sequence{an}and filter impulse responsehnrepresented asxn=hnTan, where superscript T denotes the transpose operator. The vectorxnis fed to the equalizer to combat the interference introduced by the physical channel and estimate delayed version of the transmitted sequence{an−δ}, where δ denotes delay.Letwn=[wn,0,wn,1,…,wn,N−1]Tbe the impulse response of equalizer andxn=[xn,xn−1,…,xn−N+1]Tbe the regression vector (vector of channel observations), N is the number of equalizer taps. The output of equalizer is convolution of regression vector and equalizer impulse response given asyn=wn−1Hxnwhere superscript H denotes the Hermitian conjugate operator. Lettn=hn⊗wn−1⁎be the overall channel-equalizer impulse response (⊗ denotes convolution operation and the superscript ⁎ denotes complex conjugate operator). If the channel response is given by a K-tap vectorhn=[hn,0,hn,1,…,hn,K−1], then the channel convolution matrixHis given by(1)H=[hn,00⋯0⋯hn,1hn,0⋱0⋱⋮hn,1⋱⋮⋱hn,K−1⋮⋱hn,0⋱0hn,K−1⋱hn,1⋱⋮⋮⋯⋱⋱]Using (1), we obtaintn=hn⊗wn−1⁎=Hwn−1⁎. Under successful convergence, we havetn=ewheree=[0,…,0,1,0,…,0]T.Consider a generic stochastic gradient-based adaptive equalizer [4] for which the updating algorithm is given as(2)wn=wn−1+μΦ(yn)⁎xnwhere μ is a small positive step size, governing the speed of convergence and the level of steady-state equalizer performance, andΦ(yn)is complex valued error-function. In principle,Φ(yn)satisfies the Bussgang condition on successful convergence [24], i.e.,E[ynΦ(yn−i)⁎]=0,∀i,n. The error-function of a multimodulus equalizer is non-analytic in nature, i.e., it is a decoupled function of the quadrature components of deconvolved sequence yn, which is expressed as(3)Φ(yn)=ϕ(yR,n)+jϕ(yI,n),so that the real and imaginary parts ofΦ(yn)are obtained from the real and imaginary parts of yn,yR,nandyI,n, respectively.The MMA2-2 equalization algorithm was proposed independently in [9,10,25], which employs a split cost function(4)JMMA2-2=minw{E(yR,n2−RR2)2+E(yI,n2−RI2)2}where RRand RIare defined asRR2≔EaR4/EaR2andRI2≔EaI4/EaI2, in which aRand aIdenote the real and imaginary parts of transmitted sequence{an}, respectively. The MMA2-2 cost function can be considered as the sum of two one-dimensional cost functions, expressing the dispersion of the equalizer in the complex constellation plane. The tap weight vector of MMA2-2 is updated according to(5)wn=wn−1+μ[(RR2−yR,n2)yR,n+j(RI2−yI,n2)yI,n]⁎xnNotably, due to its decoupled error-function, MMA2-2 is capable of compensating residual phase-offset and moderate frequency-offset mismatches without requiring additional hardware. Interested readers may refer to [26,27] for discussions on phase recovery capability of MMA2-2. As far as ISI cancellation capability is concerned, the stationary points of MMA2-2 are closely related to those of CMA2-2 [8,11]. For the sake of comparison, the CMA2-2 update iswn=wn−1+μ(R2−|yn|2)yn⁎xn.Recently, Abrar and Nandi [23] have proposed a new multimodulus algorithm, the βMMA, for joint blind equalization and carrier phase recovery in square-QAM signaling. The algorithm is derived by solving a constrained maximization problem. Results have indicated a superior performance to be exhibited by βMMA, for higher-order QAM signaling on both symbol and fractionally spaced channels, as compared to established methods including MMA2-2 and CMA2-2. The cost function of βMMA is given as [23]11The cost (6) first appeared in [28] and was solved by quadratic programming.(6)JβMMA=maxw{EyR,n2+EyI,n2}subjecttomax{|yR,n|}=max{|yI,n|}≤γwhere γ is the largest amplitude of quadrature component; for M-ary square-QAM with signal levels{±1,±3,…,±γ}, we haveγ=M−1. The tap weight vector of βMMA is updated according to(7)wn=wn−1+μ(fRyR,n+jfIyI,n)⁎xnwhere fLis equal to unity if|yL,n|≤γ, and it is equal to −β, otherwise (where L denotes either R or I). The parameter β is a statistical constant whose value is evaluated to be equal to(γ2+2)/(3γ).In order to perform tracking analysis, we consider a non-stationary system model. In such environment, the variations in the Wiener solution (zero-forcing solution or optimal equalizer),wo, follow (usually) first-order random walk model [4]. The optimal weights from one iteration to another are described by(8)wno=wn−1o+qnwhere the new weight is the previous weight plus a random fluctuation denoted byqn. The random vectorqnis independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean random vector whose positive definite covariance matrix is given asQ=EqnqnH=σq2I, where σqis the standard deviation ofqn(E denotes expected value). We are going to assume thatqnis independent of both{am}and{xm,w−1o}for allm<n[4]. Using the Wiener solution, the desired data ancan be expressed as(9)an=(wn−1o)Hxn+vn,wherevnis the measurement noise and is uncorrelated withxn,E(vn⁎xn)=0[29]. Defining weight error vectorw˜nasw˜n≔wno−wn, (2) for non-stationary case can be rewritten as(10)w˜n=w˜n−1−μΦ(yn)⁎xn+qnThe so-called a priori and a posteriori estimation errors are defined asea,n≔w˜n−1Hxnandep,n≔(w˜n−qn)Hxn, respectively. After some mathematical manipulations, one gets [4](11)ea,n=ep,n+μ‖xn‖2Φ(yn)where∥·∥represents the Euclidean norm. It is important to note thatea,ndepends on channel variation, adaption, and gradient noise. The steady-state EMSE and tracking performance of an adaptive equalizer can be quantified by the energy ofea,n. From (11), we can associate the error-function of an equalizer with the a priori and the a posteriori estimation errors as follows:(12)Φ(yn)=ea,n−ep,nμ‖xn‖2Substituting (12) in (10), and after some mathematical manipulation we obtain the energy conservation relation as follows:(13)‖w˜n‖2+|ea,n|2‖xn‖2=‖w˜n−1‖2+|ep,n|2‖xn‖2It is important to note that (13) holds for any adaptive algorithm. Fig. 2represents the physical interpretation of (13), which links the energies of the weight error vector, the a priori and the a posteriori estimation errors by stating that mapping from the variables{w˜n−1,ep,n/∥xn∥}to the variables{w˜n,ea,n/∥xn∥}is energy preserving. The functionMdenotes the mapping between the two variables andz−1denotes the unit delay operator.Substituting the value ofep,nfrom (11) into (13), we get the following (variance relation) theorem:Theorem 1Variance Relation, Sayed [4]Consider any adaptive filter of the form(2), and assume filter operation in steady-state. Assume further thatan=(wn−1o)Hxn+vn, wherewn−1ovaries according to the random-walk model(8), whereqnis a zero-mean i.i.d. sequence with covariance matrixQ. Moreover,qnis independent of{am}and{xm,w−1o}for allm<n. Havingyn=an−ea,n, it holds that(T1.1)2ER[ea,n⁎Φ(yn)]=μE‖xn‖2E|Φ(yn)|2+μ−1E‖qn‖2whereR[·]denotes the real part of complex entity.Expression (T1.1) can be solved for steady-state EMSE, which is defined as(14)EMSE≜limn→∞E|ea,n|2The procedure of evaluating EMSE using (T1.1) avoids the need of explicit evaluation ofE‖w˜n‖2or its steady-state valueE‖w˜∞‖2. In the sequel, in addition to variance relation, we aim to make use of the following assumptions:(A1)In steady-state the a priori errorea,nis independent of both the transmitted sequence{an}and the regressor vectorxn[4].The filter taps are large enough so that by virtue of central limit theorem,ea,nis the zero-mean complex valued Gaussian [29,30].The optimum filter achieves perfect equalization (zero-forcing solution)an≈(wn−1o)Hxn, however due to channel variation and gradient noise, the equalizer weight vector is not equal townoeven in steady-state [31]. Additionally, no additive noise is assumed in the system.Here onwards, for the sake of notational simplicity, we employζ≔EMSE,ea≔ea,n,y≔yn,a≔an,Φ≔Φ(yn),Px=E‖xn‖2,Pq=E‖qn‖2andPa=E|a|2=E(aR2+aI2).In order to evaluate the analytical expression for the steady-state EMSE of MMA2-2, we need to evaluate the energy of error-function as well as its correlation with a priori estimation error. Implementing these steps, we have the following theorem for the tracking performance of MMA2-2 equalizer:Theorem 2Tracking EMSE of MMA2-2Consider the MMA2-2 recursion(5)with complex-valued data. Considering non-stationary model(8)with a sufficiently small degree of non-stationarity. Then its EMSE can be approximated by the following expression for a sufficiently small step-size μ:(T2.1)ζMMA2-2(μ)=μc1+1μPqc2−μc3,(T2.2)μoptMMA2-2=Pqc1c22+Pq2c32−Pqc3c1c2withζminMMA2-2=2Pqμoptc2wherec1≔2Px(EaR6−2RR2EaR4+RR4EaR2),c2≔2(3EaR2−RR2), andc3≔Px(3EaR4+RR4). Substituting the expression forμoptinto the expression of EMSE we find the corresponding optimal EMSE.The error-function of MMA2-2 equalizer is given byΦ=(RR2−yR2)yR+j(RI2−yI2)yI. Towards evaluating the RHS of (T1.1), we computeE|Φ|2as follows:(15)E|Φ|2=RR4EyR2−2RR2EyR4+EyR6+RI4EyI2−2RI2EyI4+EyI6For the given value of a, owing to (A2), the quadrature components of the equalizer output y may be modeled as Gaussian distributed so that its density is given by(16)p(yL|aL)=12πσexp(−(yL−aL)22σ2)whereσ2≔ER[ea]2=EI[ea]2, i.e.,ζ=2σ2. Using (16), the required moments in (15) may be computed asEyLp=∫−∞∞yLpp(yL|aL)dyL,which givesEyL2=EaL2+ζ2,EyL4=EaL4+3ζEaL2+34ζ2, andEyL6=EaL6+152ζEaL4+454ζ2EaL2+158ζ3. Substituting the computed moments in (15), we obtain(17)E|Φ|2=308ζ3+ζ2(454EaR2−32RR2+454EaI2−32RI2)+ζ(32EaR4+12RR4+32EaI4+12RI4)+EaR6+RR4EaR2−2RR2EaR4+EaI6+RI4EaI2−2RI2EaI4Thus, the RHS of (T1.1) is computed as(18)RHS=μPx(308ζ3+ζ2(454EaR2−32RR2+454EaI2−32RI2)+ζ(32EaR4+12RR4+32EaI4+12RI4)+EaR6+RR4EaR2−2RR2EaR4+EaI6+RI4EaI2−2RI2EaI4)+μ−1PqSinceea⁎=(aR−yR)−j(aI−yI). Substitutingea⁎in (T1.1), the LHS is evaluated asLHS=2ER[ea⁎Φ]=2RR2EaRyR−2EaRyR3−2RR2EyR2+2EyR4+2RI2EaIyI−2EaIyI3−2RI2EyI2+2EyI4. SubstitutingyL=(aL−eaL)and evaluating the expectation, we getEaLyL=EaL2andEaLyL3=(EaL4+32ζEaL2). Finally, we get(19)LHS=3ζ2+ζ(3EaR2−RR2+3EaI2−RI2)Combining (18) and (19), we obtain(20)308ζ3μPx+ζ2(μPx(454EaR2−32RR2+454EaI2−32RI2)−3)+ζ(μPx(32EaR4+12RR4+32EaI4+12RI4)−3EaR2+RR2−3EaI2+RI2)+μPx(EaR6+RR4EaR2−2RR2EaR4+EaI6+RI4EaI2−2RI2EaI4)+μ−1Pq=0The QAM constellation exhibits four-quadrant symmetry which impliesEaRp=EaIpand RR=RI. So, Eq. (20) can be rewritten just in terms of real components and this yields a cubic expression to solve for EMSE of MMA2-2 equalizer as given by(21)308ζ3μPx+ζ2(μPx(904EaR2−3RR2)−3)−ζ(6EaR2−2RR2−μPx(3EaR4+RR4))+μPx(2EaR6+2RR4EaR2−4RR2EaR4)+μ−1Pq=022Here, we emphasize that no approximations were involved in the derivation of (21). Also, it is experimentally observed that EMSE is the smallest positive root of (21).In order to evaluate some closed-form expressions ofζMMA2-2, certain approximations have to be made, e.g., by neglecting the cubic and quadratic terms in (21), we obtain(22)ζ(μPx(3EaR4+RR4)−6EaR2+2RR2)+μPx(2EaR6+2RR4EaR2−4RR2EaR4)+μ−1Pq=0which yields the following closed-form solution:(23)ζMMA2−2=μ2Px(2EaR6+2RR4EaR2−4RR2EaR4)+Pqμ(6EaR2−2RR2)−μ2Px(3EaR4+RR4)Using (23) and solving∇μζMMA2-2=0, the optimum μ is obtained as(24)μoptMMA2-2=Pqc1c22+Pq2c32−Pqc3c1c2wherec1≔Px(2EaR6+2RR4EaR2−4RR2EaR4),c2≔6EaR2−2RR2, andc3≔Px(3EaR4+RR4). Expression (24) leads to the minimum EMSE,ζminMMA2-2, as follows:(25)ζminMMA2-2=Pqμopt(3EaR2−RR2)which completes the proof.□SinceRR2=EaR4/EaR2, we expressζminMMA2-2=PqEaR2/(μopt(3(EaR2)2−EaR4)). Note that the quantity,κaR≔EaR4−3(EaR2)2, is the kurtosis of the quadrature component of transmitted signal anand it is a negative quantity due to the sub-Gaussian nature of an. DenotingσaR2≔EaR2, we obtain(26)ζminMMA2-2=PqσaR2μopt|κaR|Expression (26) implies that if the transmitted signal tends to be Gaussian (i.e.,κaR→0), then the equalizer implementing MMA2-2 will diverge without bound. This behavior is in accordance with the Benveniste–Goursat–Ruget theorem [35], which states that the transmitted signal is required necessarily to be non-Gaussian in order to get equalized.Under similar conditions and assumptions, as mentioned in Section 3.1, we have the following theorem for tracking performance of βMMA:Theorem 3Tracking EMSE ofβMMAConsider the βMMA recursion(7)with complex-valued data. Considering the non-stationary model(8)with a sufficiently small degree of non-stationarity, its EMSE can be approximated by the following expression for a sufficiently small step-size μ:(T3.1)ζβMMA(μ)=(c4+c3μ+(c4+c3μ)2−4(c2+c1μ)(c5μ+1μPq)2(c2+c1μ))2,(T3.2)μoptβMMA=Pqc5withζminβMMA=ζβMMA(μoptβMMA),wherec1≔Px(1+(1/M)(β2−1)),c2≔2(1−(1/M)(β+1)),c3≔(2/πM)γPx(β2−1),c4≔−(4/πM)γ(β+1), andc5≔(Pa+(2/M)γ2(β2−1))Px. Substituting the expression forμoptinto the expression of EMSE we find the corresponding optimal EMSE.The error-function of βMMA equalizer is given asΦ=fRyR+jfIyI. The RHS of (T1.1) for βMMA is thus evaluated as follows:(27)E|Φ|2=E[yR{|yR|<γ}2+β2yR{|yR|>γ}2+yI{|yI|<γ}2+β2yI{|yI|>γ}2]=EyR2+2(β2−1)EyR{yR>γ}2+EyI2+2(β2−1)EyI{yI>γ}2=EaR2+ζ+2(β2−1)×E[12πexp(−(aR−γ)2ζ)(aR+γ)ζ2+12(aR2+ζ2)(1+erf(aR−γζ))]+EaI2+2(β2−1)E[12πexp(−(aI−γ)2ζ)(aI+γ)ζ2+12(aI2+ζ2)(1+erf(aI−γζ))]whereerf(·), the Gauss error function, is defined aserf(x)=(2/π)∫0xexp(−t2)dt. Using (27), the RHS of (T1.1) for βMMA equalizer becomes(28)RHS=μPx[EaR2+ζ+2(β2−1)×E[12πexp(−(aR−γ)2ζ)(aR+γ)ζ2+12(aR2+ζ2)(1+erf(aR−γζ))]+EaI2+2(β2−1)E[12πexp(−(aI−γ)2ζ)(aI+γ)ζ2+12(aI2+ζ2)(1+erf(aI−γζ))]]+μ−1PqNext substituting the a priori error in (T1.1), the LHS for βMMA is evaluated as(29)LHS=2ER[ea⁎Φ]=2E[aRfRyR−fRyR2+aIfIyI−fIyI2]=2E(aRyR−yR2)−4(β+1)E(aRyR−yR2){yR>γ}+2E(aIyI−yI2)−4(β+1)E(aIyI−yI2){yI>γ}Exploiting assumption (A2), we obtain(30)LHS=−2ζ+4(β+1)E[γ2ζπexp(−(aR−γ)2ζ)+ζ4(1+erf(aR−γζ))]+4(β+1)E[γ2ζπexp(−(aL−γ)2ζ)+ζ4(1+erf(aL−γζ))]Owing to four quadrant symmetry of QAM constellation, the moments evaluated for in-phase component are same as those for quadrature component. Simplifying and combining (28) and (30), we obtain(31)μPx(2EaR2+ζ+4(β2−1)A)+μ−1Pq+2ζ−8(β+1)B=0whereA≔E[12πexp(−(aR−γ)2ζ)(aR+γ)ζ2+12(aR2+ζ2)(1+erf(aR−γζ))],andB≔E[γ2ζπexp(−(aR−γ)2ζ)+ζ4(1+erf(aR−γζ))].Since the argument inside the exponent function,(aR−γ)2, is always positive, we haveexp(·)=0foraR≠γandζ⪡1. However, whenaR=γ, we haveexp(·)=1with probabilityPr[aR=γ]. Similarly, under the assumptionζ⪡1,erf(·)is equal to −1, and 0, respectively, for the cases (aR<γ), and(aR=γ). These considerations yield(32)A≈{0ifaR≠γ(γζπ+12(γ2+12ζ))Pr[aR=γ]ifaR=γ(33)andB≈{0ifaR≠γ(γζ2π+14ζ)Pr[aR=γ]ifaR=γSince an M-point constellation is being considered, the probabilityPr[aR=γ]is equal to1/M. Denotingc1≔Px(1+(1/M)(β2−1)),c2≔2(1−(1/M)(β+1)),c3≔(2/πM)γPx(β2−1),c4≔−(4/πM)γ(β+1), andc5≔(Pa+(2/M)γ2(β2−1))Px, and by combining (31)–(33), we obtain(34)(c2+c1μ)ζ+(c4+c3μ)ζ+(c5μ+1μPq)=0.Solving it by quadratic formula we obtain (T3.1).Further, substitutingζ=u2and taking derivative with respect to μ, we obtain(35)(c1u+c3)u+(c4+c3μ+2(c2+c1μ)u)dudμ+(c5−1μ2Pq)=0For the optimum value of μ, we havedu/dμ=0; this gives(36)μoptβMMA=Pqc1ζminβMMA+c3ζminβMMA+c5Sincec1ζminβMMA+c3(ζminβMMA)0.5⪡c5, ignoring them we obtain (T3.2).□In this section, we verify the tracking performance analyses for MMA2-2 and βMMA. The experiments have been performed considering (i) an equalized zero-forcing situation perturbed with random noise vector, (ii) a time-invariant channel, (iii) a time-varying channel (with a constant mean part and an autoregressive random part), and (iv) the effect of filter length on equalization performance.In this experiment, the elements of perturbation vectorqnare modeled as zero-mean wide-sense stationary and mutually uncorrelated. The corresponding positive definite autocorrelation matrix ofqnis obtained asQ=σq2I(whereσq=10−3).33Note that this modeling (i.e., zero off-diagonal elements inQ) is justified in the light of our analytical findings in Theorems 2 and 3 which imply that the EMSE depends neither on the individual diagonal elements nor the off-diagonal elements of matrixQ, but rather depends on the trace ofQas denoted by Pq. In other words, given the sum of the mean square fluctuations of the elements ofqn, the EMSE does not depend on the contribution of individual elements.The simulated EMSE has been obtained for equalizer lengths N=7 and N=21 for 16- and 64-QAM signals,44In MMA2-2, RR=RIare equal to 8.2 and 37 for 16- and 64-QAM, respectively. In βMMA, the parameter β is equal to 1.22 and 2.43 for 16- and 64-QAM, respectively.respectively. Each simulated trace is obtained by performing 100 independent runs where each run is executed for5×103iterations. Note that, due to assuming an already equalized scenario, we do not have to worry about the iterations required for successful convergence of the equalizer; thus the EMSE is computed for all iterations. The equalizer was initialized such that the first tap was unity and all taps were zero. The Monte-Carlo simulation requires to add the perturbationqndirectly in the weight update process. The weight update, in this experiment, is thus governed by(37)wno=wn−1o+μΦ(yn)⁎xn+qnThe terms containing the step-size μ andqncontribute to acquisition and tracking errors [4], respectively. The rule (37) has been adopted in [4,15–17,31].Since this experimental setup aims to evaluate both acquisition and tracking errors, the resulting EMSE is a convex downward function of step-size μ. Refer to Figs. 3 and 4for the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE of MMA2-2 equalizer. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (21) and (T2.1), respectively. It is evident from this result that, for both QAM with smaller filter length (i.e., N=7), the numerical, the closed-form and the simulated traces conform each other for all values of step-sizes. However, for larger filter length (i.e., N=21), traces start deviating from each other for higher values of EMSE. Noticeably, for all four simulation cases, the analytically obtained minimum EMSE(ζminMMA2-2)and the optimum step-size(μoptMMA2-2), as marked, respectively, with markers▹and◊, are in good conformation with those obtained from simulation.Next refer to Figs. 5 and 6for the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE of βMMA equalizer. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (31) and (T3.1), respectively. It is evident from this result that, for both QAM with smaller filter length (i.e., N=7), the numerical, the closed-form and the simulated traces conform each other for all values of step-sizes. However, for larger filter length (i.e., N=21), traces start deviating from each other for higher values of EMSE. Noticeably, for all four simulation cases, the analytically obtained minimum EMSE(ζminβMMA)and the optimum step-size(μoptβMMA), as marked, respectively, with markers▹and◊, match closely with those obtained from simulation.To appreciate the lower EMSE exhibited by βMMA as compared to MMA2-2, we summarize the findings of above experiments for 16-QAM depicting the values of minimum EMSE achieved by both algorithms in Table 1. Note that (as expected) the numerical results are closer to those obtained by simulation.Next we compare the abilities of MMA2-2 and βMMA to track the variations in non-stationary environments by obtaining the ratio of the minimum achievable steady-state EMSE as exhibited by MMA2-2 to that of βMMA. Mathematically, we compute the following ratio:(38)η≔ζminMMA2-2ζminβMMAThis ratio is obtained for 16-, 64- and 256-QAM and is summarized in Table 2which indicates that the value of the minimum steady-state EMSE of βMMA is always less than that of MMA2-2 which reflects the superiority of βMMA over MMA2-2 for tracking variations in non-stationary environments.In contrast to experiment I where we considered a zero-forcing scenario subject to random perturbation, here in this experiment, we consider an interfering T/2-spaced time-invariant channel whose impulse response is given byhn=[0.1,0.3,1,−0.1,0.5,0.2]as used in [15,31]. In the sequel, we refer to this channel as channel-1. Since we are not considering the random perturbation(σq=0), the estimated EMSE comprises acquisition error only and is supposed to be a monotonic increasing function of step-size μ.In this experiment, we consider a T/2-spaced equalizer and 16-QAM signaling for both MMA2-2 and βMMA. The equalizer is initialized such that the central tap is set to unity and the rest are set to zero. Refer to Fig. 7(a) for the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE obtained for MMA2-2. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (21) and (T2.1), respectively. Similarly, Fig. 7(b) depicts the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE of βMMA equalizer in the presence of similar channel. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (31) and (T3.1), respectively. It is evident from these results that the analytical and simulated traces conform closely with each other.Note that the result in Fig. 7 also reveals that the steady-state EMSE (subject to successful convergence) of the larger filter will be higher than that of the smaller filter for the given value of step-size. Refer to Fig. 8where the convergence traces of EMSE are depicted for two different filter lengths (N=7 and 21) forμ=1×10−4. The average values of the converged steady-state EMSE (for N=7 and 21) match closely with analytically estimated values obtained from Theorems 2 and 3.In contrast to experiments I and II, here we evaluate the performance analysis of the addressed equalizers in the presence of time-varying (TV) channel. A TV channel is usually modeled such that its autocorrelation properties correspond to wide-sense stationary and uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) (as suggested by [36]). However, as reported in [37], a first-order (Gauss–Markov) autoregressive model is sufficient enough to model a slow-varying channel as given byhn=hconst+cn, wherehnandhconstare as specified in Section 2, andcnis the first-order Markov process as given bycn=αcn−1+dnwhere α is a constant, and the vectordnis a zero-mean i.i.d. circular complex Gaussian process with correlation matrixD55For an AR(1) system,α=J0(2πfDT), which makes the autocorrelation of the taps modeled bycn=αcn−1+dnequal the true autocorrelation at unit lag (whereJ0is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind, fDis the Doppler rate and T is the baud duration). The parameter α determines the rate of the channel variation while the variancesσd,i2of the ith entry ofdndetermines the magnitude of the variation. So, α andσd,i2determine how “fast” and how “much” the time-varying partcn,iof each channel taphn,ivary with respect to the known mean of that taphconst,i. The value of α can be estimated from the estimate of fD. Similarly, given the average energy of the ith part ofcn, E|cn,i|2, the value ofσd,iis evaluated as [37]σd,i=|hconst,i|21−α2/E|cn,i|2..The matrixD, due to WSSUS assumption, is diagonal and each of its diagonal element is σd2. In the present scenario, we considerσd2=1×10−3,α=0.999, andhconst=[1+0.2j,−0.2+0.1j,0.1−0.1j]Tusing a 7-tap baud-spaced equalizer with 16-QAM signaling. The ISI introduced by mean tap vectorhconstis −11.72dB. All simulation points were obtained by executing the program 10 times (or runs) with random and independent generation of transmitted data and channel perturbation. Each run was executed for as many iterations as required for the equalization of mean channel pathhconst. Once convergence is acquired, the equalizer is run for further 5000 iterations for the computation of steady-state value of EMSE.Refer to Fig. 9for the comparison of theoretical and simulated EMSE of MMA2-2 and βMMA equalizers. The legend ‘Analysis’ refers to the solutions (T2.1) and (T3.1) for MMA2-2 and βMMA equalizers, respectively. It is evident from the results that the theoretical and simulated EMSE traces conform each other. Note that the factorPq=E‖qn‖2=trace(Q)has been replaced withtrace(D)in the evaluation of analytical EMSE. In the sequel, we refer to this TV channel (hn) as channel-2.In all previous experiments, we have considered different channel conditions where the effect of filter-length on equalization capability has not been taken in consideration. It is quite obvious that a reasonable filter-length is required to equalize successfully a propagation channel. An insufficient filter-length, therefore, introduces an additional distortion which have not been considered in Theorems 2 and 3. However, as mentioned in [3], the distortive effect of insufficient filter-length may easily be incorporated (in the EMSE expressions) as an additive term; the total EMSE, which we denote as TEMSE, is thus given as follows:(39)TEMSE=limn→∞E|ea,n|2︸≕ζ+E|an|2‖Hwo⁎−e‖2︸≕χwhere ζ is EMSE as we obtained in Theorems 2 and 3, and χ is the additional squared error contributed by the (insufficient) filter-length. The vectorwois the zero-forcing solution,His the channel matrix, andeis the overall idealistic (single-spike) channel-equalizer impulse response as defined in Section 2.In Section 4.2, we have observed that the EMSE, ζ, is proportional to filter-length for the given step-size. The parameter χ on the other hand decreases with filter-length.66The actual expression of χ (as denoted by Dfin [3, Eq. 4.8.24]) contains an equalizer solution (as denoted byθ¯) that also depends on blind equalization error-function. However, we have observed that the exact value ofθ¯is very close toH+efor both MMA2-2 and βMMA where(·)+denotes pseudo-inverse. So, in this work, we have replaced the exact expression ofθ¯with its simplified formwo⁎=H+eand our simulation findings (as depicted in Fig. 10) validate that this simplification is reasonable.In our simulation, the value of optimal weight vectorwois obtained aswo=pinv(H)ewherepinv(·)is the MATLAB function for the evaluation of pseudo-inverse. The TEMSE as expressed in (39) is a convex downward function of filter-length. Evaluating TEMSE for different filter-lengths can provide us with the optimal value of filter-length required to equalize the given channel and given step-size. In this simulation, we have considered a voice-band telephone channelhn=[−0.005−0.004j,0.009+0.03j,−0.024−0.104j,0.854+0.52j,−0.218+0.273j,0.049−0.074j,−0.016+0.02j][38] and 16-QAM signaling. The ISI introduced by this channel is −8.44dB. In the sequel, we refer to this channel as channel–3.All simulation points were obtained by executing the program 10 times (or runs) with random and independent generation of transmitted data. Each run was executed for as many iterations as required for the convergence. Once convergence is acquired, the equalizer is run for further 5000 iterations for the computation of steady-state value of EMSE. In Fig. 10, we depict analytical and simulated TEMSE obtained as a function of filter-length for the given step-sizes for both MMA2-2 and βMMA. Both analytical and simulated TEMSE are found to be in close agreement.
