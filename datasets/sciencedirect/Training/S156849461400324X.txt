@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In medical system, there may be many critical diseases, where experts do not have sufficient knowledge to handle those problems. For these cases, experts may provide their opinion only about certain aspects of the disease and remain silent for those unknown features. Feeling the need of prioritizing different experts based on their given information, this article uses a novel concept for assigning confident weights to different experts which are mainly based on their provided information. Experts provide their opinions about various symptoms using intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix (IFSM). In this article, we propose an algorithmic approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) which explores a particular disease reflecting the agreement of all experts. This approach is guided by the group decision making (GDM) model and uses cardinals of IFSS as novel concept. We have used choice matrix (CM) as an important parameter which is based on choice parameters of individual expert. This article has also validated the proposed approach using distance measurements and consents of the majority of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a suitable case study.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Disease diagnosis is one of the difficult tasks of medical science. As complex decision making, disease diagnosis involves a number of symptoms analysis, so this process sometimes takes too long time to reach conclusion of exact disease. Similarly, this might yield wrong diagnosis due to overlooking of few trivial symptoms, which leads to worse situation. To ease this complex decision making process, use of computing techniques mainly expert system has a long history with disease diagnosis. Success had been achieved respectively with those systems but problem was uncertainty modeling. All those early systems were made to handle crisp data. But in real world there is a degree of uncertainty involved in every decision making process. In 1965, proposal of fuzzy set theory by Zadeh [1] was the corner stone to solve such uncertain scenario. Since then, there are many developments in the field and researchers [2,3] started to use fuzzy expert system for medical diagnostic procedures.Several other methods, including statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and neural networks have been used as an aid to medical diagnosis [4–9]. Group decision making using fuzzy soft set constitutes another approach to aid medical diagnosis. GDM using fuzzy soft set consists of multiple experts interacting with each other to reach a final conclusion based on their observations. Each decision maker might have their own thought which differs from others’ in various aspects but they should have a common goal to reach the ultimate destination. GDM problem consists of finding the best alternative(s) from a set of feasible alternatives according to the preferences provided by a group of experts. The alternatives are classified from best to worst, using the information known according to the set of experts.Molodtsov [10] presented soft set as a completely generic mathematical tool for modeling uncertainties. He introduced the concept of soft set theory [10] similar to some other traditional tools such as the theory of probability [35], theory of fuzzy sets [1], rough set theory [36], and the interval mathematics. But all these theories have their own difficulties due to the inadequacy of the parameterization. Molodtsov [10] proposed soft set theory which is free from such kind of difficulties. Maji et al. [11,12] pursued further investigation on soft set theory by defining some operations and established the soft set into decision making problems. As defined by Molodtsov [10], in soft set theory, initial description of any object has an approximate nature and one do not need to introduce the notion of exact solution. In several fields of sciences, engineering, economics, and medicals sciences, the soft set theory is being used very conveniently due to the absence of any restrictions on the approximate descriptions. A number of applications of soft sets are found in different fields including texture classification and business applications [13–16]. Some new operations on soft set theory are given by Ali et al. [17]. The concept of soft group was introduced by Aktas and Cagman [18] in 2007. Presently, the work on soft set theory is progressing rapidly. Maji and Roy [11] addressed an application of soft set theory in decision making problems. Under Maji and Roy's inspiration, Xiao et al. [13] developed soft set theory into the research of business competitive capacity evaluation. In 2006, Mushrif et al. [14] proposed a new approach for classification of natural textures. Chen et al. [19] presented a revised definition of soft sets parameterization reduction and compared with the related concept of attribute reduction in rough sets theory. In soft set theory, the parameterization is done with the help of words, sentences etc. The parameters may not be crisp always. They may be fuzzy words or sentence involving fuzzy words. Vagueness presented in soft set demanded Fuzzy Soft Set (FSS) [20] to be evolved. Maji et al. [20] initiated the concept of fuzzy soft sets as the combination of fuzzy sets and soft sets. Roy and Maji [37] proposed fuzzy soft set theoretic approach to present the application of fuzzy soft set in decision making problem. Later, Kong et al. [38] claimed that the method presented in [37] was incorrect and proposed a revised algorithm. Satisfactory evaluation of membership values is not always possible because of the insufficiency in the available information besides the presence of vagueness situation. Also evaluation of non-membership values is also not always possible for the same reason. As a result hesitation evolves. Fuzzy soft set theory was not found suitable to solve such kind of problems. In those situations intuitionistic fuzzy soft set theory [21] was proved to be more suitable. Maji et al. [21,39,40] presented the notion of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set theory which is based on a combination of the intuitionistic fuzzy set [22,23] and soft set [10] models.In this article, an algorithmic approach is proposed to solve group decision making problem in medical science using intuitionistic fuzzy soft set based operations. Generally, experts evaluate a set of symptoms for disease diagnosing purpose. Often it is found that the individual experts are not paying careful attention on all the symptoms, rather they express their interest only for a subset of symptoms which they think to be more significant. They often believe those subset of symptoms can efficiently fulfill their purpose. When diagnose is done in this manner, then different experts might differ in their opinions and it becomes quite difficult to properly diagnose a patient. Some expert might diagnose that the patient suffering from one disease while the other expert's opinion differs. To resolve this type of situation, we propose a method that collects all the related experts’ opinion about various possible diseases and their observed symptoms characteristics. Then a confident weight is assigned to each of the experts which depend on their prescribed opinions. We have used a novel concept using cardinal of intuitionistic fuzzy soft set to compute the weight. The proposed confident weight also reduces the chance of biasing. Once the weights are assigned to individual experts’ opinions, we present a consensus reaching approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft set where all experts deliver their agreement for a final disease. The correctness of the proposed approach has been validated using distance measurements and consents of a majority of experts. As many of the previous approaches, this article does not use any standard medical knowledgebase related information during decision making, rather this article rely on the information given by the experts. Only for validating the final diagnosis, we use medical knowledgebase.The rest of this article is organized as follows. Preliminaries contains primary discussions of the various useful ideas including intuitionistic fuzzy set, distance measurements (Hamming and Euclidean), intuitionistic fuzzy soft set, intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix and some operations on them. The proposed approach and cardinals of IFSS to solve intuitionistic fuzzy soft set based decision making problem is presented in Proposed approach section. Then Case study section includes a practical case study for clarifying our proposed method. Hamming and Euclidean distance observations to validate our approach is adhered in Validation of results using distance measurements followed by discussions and comparisons with existing works in the next section. Finally conclusions are given in last section.In this section, we first recall some basic ideas of intuitionistic fuzzy set, soft set and their properties. Then we point out some interesting connection between these two sets.Let X be a universe of discourse, then a fuzzy set(1)A={<x,μA(x)>|x∈X}defined by Zadeh [1] is characterized by a membership function μA: X→[0, 1], where μA(x) represents the degree of membership of the element x to the set A. Atanassov [22,23] introduced a more general version of fuzzy set called intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), defined as follows:(2)Aˆ={<x,μAˆ(x),νAˆ(x)>|x∈X}which is characterized by a membership functionμAˆ: X→[0, 1] and a non-membership functionvAˆ: X→[0, 1] with the condition(3)0≤μAˆ(x)+νAˆ(x)≤1for all x∈X where the numbersμAˆ(x)andνAˆ(x)denotes the degree of membership and the degree of non membership respectively of the element x to the setAˆ. For each intuitionistic fuzzy setAˆin X, the hesitation margin or intuitionistic fuzzy index, which expresses a lack of knowledge whether x belongs toAˆor notAˆis defined as(4)πAˆ(x)=1−{μAˆ(x)+νAˆ(x)},x∈Xand is the hesitation degree of whetherx∈Aˆorx∉Aˆ. Also for each x∈X.(5)0≤πAˆ(x)≤1.Note that for an IFSAˆ, ifμAˆ(x)=0thenνAˆ(x)+πAˆ(x)=1and ifμAˆ(x)=1thenνAˆ(x)=0andπAˆ(x)=0. For each fuzzy set A in X, we have(6)πA(x)=1−μA(x)−[1−μA(x)]=0,for everyx∈X.Normalized Hamming distance and Euclidean distance measurements are the most popular distance measurements techniques which are used to find out the distance between two IFSs [24,25]. IfAˆandBˆin X={x1, x2, …, xn} are two IFSs, then the distance measurements are defined as follows:(a) Normalized Hamming Distance(7)lIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)=12n∑i=1n(|μAˆ(xi)−μBˆ(xi)|+|νAˆ(xi)−νBˆ(xi)|+|πAˆ(xi)−πBˆ(xi)|)with the condition(8)0≤lIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)≤1(b) Normalized Euclidean Distance(9)eIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)=12n∑i=1n(μAˆ(xi)−μBˆ(xi))2+(νAˆ(xi)−νBˆ(xi))2+(πAˆ(xi)−πBˆ(xi))21/2with the condition(10)0≤eIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)≤1.Let U be an initial universal set and E be a set of parameters. Let P(U) denotes the power set of U and A⊆E. A pair (F{A}, E) is called a soft set [10] over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A}: E→P(U) such that F{A}(e)=∅ if e∉A. For illustration, let us consider the following example.Example 1Let U be the set of five diseases (Viral fever, Malaria, Typhoid, Gastric ulcer, Pneumonia) given by U={d1, d2, d3, d4, d5} and E be the set of five symptoms given by E={Temperature, Headache, Stomach pain, Cough, Chest pain}={s1, s2, s3, s4, s5}.Let A={s1, s2, s3}⊂E. Now consider that F{A} is a mapping given by, F{A}(s1)={d1, d2}, F{A}(s2)={d1, d3}, F{A}(s3)={d2, d4}Then the soft set (F{A}, E)={(s1, {d1, d2}), (s2, {d1, d3}), (s3, {d2, d4}), (s4, {∅}), (s5, {∅})}. A fuzzy soft set can also be represented in the form of a two dimensional table. Table 1is the tabular representation of the soft set (F{A}, E) which is shown below.Let U be an initial universe and E be a set of parameters which are fuzzy words or sentences involving fuzzy words. Let FS(U) denotes the set of all fuzzy sets of U and A⊂E. A pairis called a fuzzy soft set (FSS) [20] over U, whereis a mapping given bysuch thatif e∉A whereis null fuzzy set.Example 2Let U and E remain same as the Example 1. Here we take A={s1, s2, s3, s5}⊂E Now suppose thatThen the fuzzy soft set is given byTabular representation of the fuzzy soft setis shown in Table 2.Let U be an initial universe and E be a set of parameters. Let IFS (U) denotes the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy sets of U and A⊂E. A pairFˆ{A},Eis called an intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) [21] over U, whereFˆ{A}is a mapping given by,so thatif e∉A where∅ˆis null intuitionistic fuzzy set (i.e. the membership value of x, μ(x)=0 the non-membership value of x, v(x)=1 and the indeterministic part of x, π(x)=0,.Example 3Let U, A and E are same like as Example 2. Let us takeThen the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set is given byTabular representation of the IFSSFˆ{A},Eis shown in Table 3.Choice matrix is a square matrix whose rows and columns both indicate parameters. If (βij)n×nis a choice matrix, then its element βijis defined as follows:βij=(1, 0) when ith and jth parameters are both choice parameters of the decision makers=(0, 1) otherwise, i.e. when at least one of the ith or jth parameters be not under choice.Example 4Let U and E are same like as Example 1. Suppose Expert X prefers to prescribe his/her observation based on symptoms or choice parameters like headache, stomach pain and chest pain which form a subset P of the parameter set E. Therefore P={s2, s3, s5}. Now the choice matrix of Expert X is represented aseP(βij)P=eP(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0Now suppose Expert X and Expert Y together wants to predict the disease according to their observations. Let choice parameter set of Expert Y is Q={s1, s2, s3, s4}. Then the combined choice matrix of Expert X and Expert Y is represented aseQ(βij)(P,Q)=eP(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)1,01,0(0,1)1,0LetFˆ{A},Ebe an IFSS over the initial universe U. Let E be a set of parameters and A⊆E. Then a subset of U×E is uniquely defined bywhich is called a relation form ofFˆ{A},E. Now the relationis characterized by the membership function μA: U×E→[0, 1] and the non-membership function vA: U×E→[0, 1]. [μA(u, e) is the membership value and vA(u, e) is the non-membership value of the object u associated with the parameter e].is represented asNow if the set of universe U={u1, u2, …, um} and the set of parameters E={e1, e2, …, en}, thenis represented by a matrix as follows:where aij=(μA(ui, ej), νA(ui, ej)).The above matrix is called an IFSM of order m×n corresponding to the intuitionistic fuzzy setFˆ{A},Eover U.Example 5Let U be the set of five diseases given by U={d1, d2, d3, d4, d5} and E be the set of parameters or symptoms given by E={s1, s2, s3, s4, s5}. Let A={s1, s2, s3, s5}⊂E. Now suppose thatFˆ{A}is given byTherefore the relational form ofFˆ{A},Eis written as below.Hence the intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix(aˆij)is written by(aˆij)=(0.2,0.7)(0.0,0.9)(0.3,0.5)(0,1)(0.9,0.1)(0.8,0.1)(0.9,0.1)(0.4,0.6)(0,1)(0.1,0.8)(0.4,0.2)(0.3,0.6)(0.8,0.1)(0,1)(0.5,0.4)(0.6,0.3)(0.4,0.6)(0.1,0.8)(0,1)(0.3,0.5)(0.7,0.2)(0.6,0.3)(0.3,0.7)(0,1)(0.1,0.8).If the number of columns of intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrixbe equal to the number of rows of the choice matrix β, thenand β are said to be conformable for the productand the productbecomes an intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Matrix. The product is denoted byor simply. IfandthenwhereExample 6Let U be the set of four diseases given by U={d1, d2, d3, d4}. Let E be the set of parameters given by E={e1, e2, e3, e4}={s1, s2, s3, s4}. Suppose that the set of choice parameters of Expert X is A={e1, e3}={s1, s3}. Let us consider an intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix is(aˆij)=(0.8,0.1)(0.2,0.7)(0.7,0.2)(0.3,0.5)(0.3,0.6)(0.7,0.1)(0.4,0.6)(0.8,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0.5,0.4)(0.1,0.8)(0.9,0.1)(0.2,0.7)The choice matrix of Expert X is(ξij)A=eA(1,0)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)Since the number of columns of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix(aˆij)is equal to the number of rows of the choice matrix(ξij)A, they are conformable for the product.Therefore(0.8,0.1)(0.2,0.7)(0.7,0.2)(0.3,0.5)(0.3,0.6)(0.7,0.1)(0.4,0.6)(0.8,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0.5,0.4)(0.1,0.8)(0.9,0.1)(0.2,0.7)⊗(1,0)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(1,0)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)(0,1)=(0.8,0.1)(0,1)(0.8,0.1)(0,1)(0.4,0.6)(0,1)(0.4,0.6)(0,1)(0.7,0.2)(0,1)(0.7,0.2)(0,1)(0.9,0.1)(0,1)(0.9,0.1)(0,1)Two intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices A and B are said to conformable for addition, if they are of the same order. The addition of two intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices[aˆij]m×nand[bˆij]m×nis defined by[aˆij]m×n⊕[bˆij]m×n=[cˆij]m×n, where[cˆij]m×nis also intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix of order m×n and(cˆij)=(max{μaˆij,μbˆij},min{νaˆij,νbˆij})∀i,j.Example 7Let[aˆij]5×5and[bˆij]5×5be two IFSMs which are given below.[a(ij)]=(0.3,0.1)(0.4.0.1)(0.3,0.6)(0.3,0.1)(0,1)(0.4,0.5)(0.1,0.7)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0,1)(0.6,0.3)(0.4,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0,1)(0.4,0.1)(0.5,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0,1)(0.6,0.3)(0.2,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.8,0.1)(0,1),[b(ij)]=(0.4,0.2)(0.6,0.1)(0.3,0.2)(0,1)(0.8,0.1)(0.3,0.5)(0.3,0.7)(0.3,0.5)(0,1)(0.4,0.5)(0.5,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.2,0.4)(0,1)(0.6,0.4)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.2)(0.6,0.3)(0,1)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.2,0.5)(0.4,0.3)(0,1)(0.4,0.3)Then[c(ij)]=[a(ij)]⊕[b(ij)]=(0.4,0.1)(0.6,0.1)(0.3,0.2)(0.3,0.1)(0.8,0.1)(0.4,0.5)(0.3,0.7)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.4,0.5)(0.6,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0.6,0.4)(0.6,0.1)(0.5,0.2)(0.6,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.6,0.2)(0.6,0.3)(0.2,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.8,0.1)(0.4,0.3)In this section, we define cardinal of IFSS, cardinal matrix [41] and cardinal score. Then we present the proposed algorithmic approach.The cardinal set of intuitionistic fuzzy soft setFˆ{A},Edenoted byand defined by, is an intuitionistic fuzzy set over E. The membershipand non membership functionofare defined by. Here |U|is the cardinality of universe U,andare scalar cardinalities of IFSSFˆ{A},E.The sets of all cardinal sets of IFSSFˆ{A},Eover U is denoted by cIFS(E). Letand. Assume that E={x1, x2, …, xn}and A⊆E. Thenis presented by the following table (Table 4).Iffor j=1, 2, …, n then the cardinal set is uniquely characterized by a matrix[aij]1xn=[a11,a12,…,a1n]which is called the cardinal matrix of the cardinal setcFˆ{A}over E.Cardinal score of a cardinal setcFˆ{A}is denoted byand defined as.Example 8Suppose the IFSM [a(ij)]5×5 for IFSSis given below.{a(ij)}=(0.3,0.1)(0.4.0.1)(0.3,0.6)(0.3,0.1)(0,1)(0.4,0.5)(0.1,0.7)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0,1)(0.6,0.3)(0.4,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0,1)(0.4,0.1)(0.5,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0,1)(0.6,0.3)(0.2,0.3)(0.5,0.3)(0.8,0.1)(0,1)Cardinals are computed asSimilarly,Cardinal matrix of the IFSM [a(ij)]5×5 is[aij]1×5=[a11a12...a15],where[aij]1×5=[(0.46,0.26)(0.32,0.32)(0.48,0.30)(0.56,0.22)(0,1)].Cardinal scoreGeneralized IFSS Based Decision Making ProblemLet D={d1, d2, ...., dm}⊆U be the set of ‘m’ objects and E={e1, e2, ....., en} be the set of ‘n’ parameters. Each parameter is described by using intuitionistic fuzzy word or sentences. Suppose ‘k’ be the number of decision makers/experts, given by P={p1, p2, …, pk} and each decision maker selects an object from U according to their set of choice parameters where choice parameters are represented by C={c1, c2, ....., cn} where C⊆E. Now the problem is to find out the optimal object from U which satisfies all of these choice parameters as much as possible.Step 1: The opinions of a set of experts P={p1, p2, ....., pk} about the various possible symptoms S={s1, s2, ..., sn} and diseases D={d1, d2, ..., dm} of a patient are recorded in IFSM.Step 2: Cardinal matrix of each IFSM is explored and then cardinal score is calculated.Step 3: Cardinal score is multiplied with each IFSM and to produce normalized IFSM. If [a(ij)]m×nbe a IFSM and cardinal score is h, then the normalized IFSM denoted by NIFSMand defined byNIFSM[a(ij)]=[h*a(ij)]m×n,for i=1, 2, …, m and j=1, 2, …, n.Step 4: Choice parameter of each experts are searched and choice matrices for all experts are explored based on the choice parameter of the decision makers.Step 5: The combined choice matrix with respect to the choice parameters of the decision makers are constructed.Step 6: The product intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices for each of the experts are computed by multiplying each normalized IFSM with the combined choice matrix as per the rule of multiplication of IFSMs.Step 7: Next the sum of these product intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices is computed to have the resultant intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices.Step 8: Then the weight of each disease di{i=1, 2, …, n} is computed by adding the membership values of the entries of its concerned row (ith row) and it is stored as W(di).Step 9: The disease having the highest weight becomes the optimal choice disease. If more than one disease have the highest weight then go to the next step.Step 10: Here one has to consider the “sum of the non-membership values” of those entries which are associated with equal weighted diseases. The disease with the minimum summation value is the optimal choice object. Now if the summation values of those objects are same then Step 11 is followed.Step 11: When “sum of the non-membership values” of those objects are same, then the sum of hesitation margins of those objects are checked and the object having minimum hesitation margin is selected. If two or more objects have same hesitation summation value, then any object among them is the optimal choice.The following additional steps are used to ensure about the result obtained by executing the above steps.Step 12: Distance measurements are investigated between the individual expert's opinion and the medical knowledgebase where lowest distance points out the proper diagnosis.Step 13: The disease is selected where opinions of a majority of experts are found to be similar.The required dataset regarding this research work was collected from a local sub divisional Government hospital at Durgapur, West Bengal, India, after a detailed discussion about the various aspects of fever with the concerned experts. Experts explained how viral fever, malaria, typhoid etc. attack human inherent immune system and by which set of symptoms one can be aware about the viral attack. They extended their assistance to talk with a few patients who are suffering from the related diseases by arranging an interview with those patients. This case study is depicted based on our understanding which was gathered from the hospital.Let U be the set of five disease (Viral fever, Malaria, Typhoid, Gastric ulcer, and Pneumonia) given by U={d1, d2, d3, d4, d5} and E be the set of five symptoms (Temperature, Headache, Stomach pain, Cough, and Chest pain) given by E={s1, s2, s3, s4, s5}. Suppose that a group of four experts P={p1, p2, p3, p4} monitoring the symptoms as per their knowledgebase to reach a consensus about which disease is more likely to appear where expert p1 is aware of symptoms (s1, s2, s3, s4) p2 is aware of symptoms (s1, s2, s3, s5), p3 is aware of (s1, s2, s4, s5) and p4 is aware of (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5).

also in this case disease d3, i.e., typhoid has the highest weight, so it is the optimal observation by all of the experts.As stated in case study, after a fruitful discussion with the corresponding medical experts, a medical knowledgebase (Table 5) is designed in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy sets consisting of a set of disease and the related set of symptoms concerned with a specific disease. The diseases and symptoms are similar as defined in case study. The details of information are given in Table 5. According to the basis of intuitionistic fuzzy set, this article describes each symptom by two numbers: membership value μA(x) and non-membership value vA(x), for simplicity hesitation margin πA(x) is not considered here.To analyze the problem, this paper investigates both Hamming and Euclidean distance between diagnoses of symptoms and observations of each expert exploited for a particular patient. The lowest obtained distance points out a proper diagnosis in both of the distance measurements. This article has used two intuitionistic fuzzy parameters such as membership function and non membership function to calculate the distance.Below we give a sample computation result to find out the Hamming distancelIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)(using (7)) and Euclidean distanceeIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)(using (9)) of Expert 1 (p1) for the disease d1 i.e., viral fever. HereAˆandBˆare two IFSs, whereAˆ={(0.6,0.3),(0.6,0.1),(0.4,0.5),(0.2,0.7),(0.3,0.5)}shows the membership and non-membership values of various symptoms E={s1, s2, s3, s4, s5} for disease d1 (viral fever) as given in medical knowledgebase (Table 5) andBˆ={(0.3,0.1),(0.4.0.1),(0.3,0.6),(0.3,0.1),(0,1)}presents opinion of expert p1 for the set of symptoms E={s1, s2, s3, s4, s5} concerned with disease d1 as shown in IFSS {a{ij}}lIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)=12×5|(0.6−0.3)|+|(0.3−0.1)|+|(0.6−0.4)|+|(0.1−0.1)|+|(0.4−0.3)|+|(0.5−0.6)|+|(0.2−0.3)|+|(0.7−0.1)|+|(0.3−0.0)|+|(0.5−1.0)|=0.24eIFS(Aˆ,Bˆ)=12×5(0.6−0.3)2+(0.3−0.1)2+(0.6−0.4)2+(0.1−0.1)2+(0.4−0.3)2+(0.5−0.6)2+(0.2−0.3)2+(0.7−0.1)2+(0.3−0.0)2+(0.5−1.0)21/2=0.30By observing distance measurements (Tables 6 and 7), this paper has furnished that the 1st expert's opinion about the patient is typhoid. According to 2nd expert the patient may suffer from pneumonia. The 3rd expert is very confident about viral fever and 4th expert agrees with 1st expert. So as per the majority of experts’ decision, it is prescribed that, the patient is suffering from typhoid which is same as described in the previous section (Case study).In this section, we briefly discuss our proposed approach and compare it with some existing methods.
