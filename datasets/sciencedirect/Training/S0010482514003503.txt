Changes in aerodynamics during vocal cord dysfunction

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
At different inhalation rate, mass flow rate in the normal cavity more than doubles flow in the VCD cavityVisualization results showed a much slower flow above the glottal region in the VCD cavity than in the normal cavityDuring episodes of VCD trying to increase inspiratory pressure so as to inhale more air may result in greater glottal resistance.

BackgroundChanges in laryngeal airflow dynamics during episodes of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) have not been well described. Very little is known about how inspiratory airflow is impacted when the vocal cords transition from normal inhalation state to a paradoxical adducted state; and how much change in laryngeal airflow and resistance occur before symptoms of stridor and air hunger emerge. This study provides new insight on the effects of VCD on respiratory airflow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques.MethodsComputed tomography images of a subject with normal vocal cords opening at the time of scanning were digitally modified to mimic an episode of VCD. To quantify and compare changes in inspiratory flow during VCD attack and normal inhalation, steady-state, laminar simulations were performed for three different breathing rates.ResultsPressure-flow analysis during VCD revealed that increasing inspiratory effort is not as efficient as in normal inhalation. Airflow resistance at the epiglottis was higher in the normal state (0.04Pa.s/mL versus 0.02Pa.s/mL) than in VCD; while resistance at the glottis and trachea remained roughly the same (0.04Pa.s/mL) during normal inhalation, it escalated during VCD (0.11Pa.s/mL and 0.13Pa.s/mL at the glottis and trachea, respectively). Peak airflow velocity and vorticity occurred around the glottis during VCD, and at the epiglottis during normal inhalation.ConclusionsThis pilot study demonstrates that attempting to force more inspired air will yield greater glottal resistance during VCD. Furthermore, there were evidence of abrupt laryngeal pressure gradient, chaotic airflow and high concentration of shear stresses in the glottal region.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a respiratory condition where the larynx exhibits intermittent paradoxical closure of the vocal cords during respiration; this condition is also known in the literature as “paradoxical vocal fold motion”, “paradoxical vocal cord motion disorder”, “episodic laryngeal dyskinesis”, “paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction”, etc [1–5]. Typical episodes of VCD last from seconds to a few minutes; occur primarily during inspiration and are felt around the upper respiratory tract (neck), resulting in symptoms identical to extrathoracic airway obstruction such as cough, choking, and shortness of breath [6–8]. VCD is often misdiagnosed as asthma which leads to inappropriate choice of treatment options for subjects with this condition [4–11]. Management of this disorder includes speech therapy; education and anxiolytics in severe cases; and inhalation of heliox mixture, particularly for acute episodes [4,7–9,11,12]. Though the prevalence of VCD in adults and kids is not clear, it is estimated that the rate of incidence is between 2.5% and 26.9% [4,7–9,13]. In addition, young females and athletes have been reported to have a higher rate of being diagnosed with this disorder [3–8,11–15].When symptoms of VCD are suspected, it is important to complete a diagnostic work up to rule out pulmonary, cardiac, or other serious conditions that require medical treatment. VCD is not usually seen on exam after the episode, largely because it is intermittent. However, a continuous laryngoscopy during exercise test is the gold standard for medical diagnosis of this disorder since it allows direct visualization of the vocal cords to determine paradoxical motions with a high degree of accuracy [4,6,8–10,13,16]. As VCD is intermittent, it can be difficult to conduct laryngoscopic examination in the middle of an acute attack due to patient distress. For this reason, provocation techniques such as performing an exercise on a treadmill or bicycle, and noxious stimuli such as methacholine, odor irritant and ergometer stress are sometimes used to trigger VCD during continuous laryngoscopic examination [1,4–7,13,16]. Spirometric measurement of inspiratory and expiratory airflow volume is an additional diagnostic tool for VCD; spirometry is less invasive and easier to obtain than laryngoscopy [1,9,13]. However, this diagnostic tool may indicate flattening or attenuation of inspiratory flow volume loops due to factors unrelated to VCD [9,13,17]. Therefore, it is recommended that for diagnosis of this disorder, a careful history of the condition must be taken plus completion of both laryngoscopy and pulmonary function testing [1,6]. Another diagnostic tool that researchers are also using to document VCD is endospirometry, a technique that combines endoscopy with spirometry [8]. In addition, differential diagnoses of VCD worth mentioning include tracheal obstruction/stenosis, neuromuscular, asthma, exercised-induced asthma, congenital abnormalities, laryngeal collapse, subglottic mass, croup, panic disorder, laryngeal tumor, foreign body aspiration, and bronchial obstruction [4,8,9,11].Nonetheless, there is scarcity of information in the literature addressing changes or disturbance in laryngeal aerodynamics during episodes of VCD. This lack of information is largely due to non-availability of a reliable clinical tool that can predict localized flow dynamics during paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques show significant promise in predicting both localized and global laryngeal aerodynamics. With CFD, airflow inside the larynx can be visualized, and localized flow variables such as velocity, vortex motions, pressure, and wall shear stress can be computed [18]. CFD methods have been used extensively by many researchers to investigate the effects of anatomic deformity on sinonasal airflow profiles [19–26]; topical drug delivery, and particle transport in the respiratory system [27–36]. CFD techniques have also been employed to study vocal cord vibration/displacement and flow dynamics in the larynx during phonation [37–41].The aim of this pilot study is to quantify and compare both upstream and downstream changes in inspiratory flow patterns during a simulated episode of VCD and during normal inhalation (when the vocal cords are open) using CFD methods. To investigate the effects of VCD on laryngeal physiology, simulation results from three different inspiratory flow rates will be presented. CFD derived variables such as laryngeal resistance, wall shear stress, airflow pressure, velocity, and vortex motions will be computed and compared for each breathing rate. These variables provide preliminary understanding relating changes in aerodynamics with patient symptoms.
