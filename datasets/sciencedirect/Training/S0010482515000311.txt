This paper proposes an optimized and efficient active surface model by improving the energy functions, searching method, neighborhood definition and resampling criterion. Extracting an accurate surface of the desired object from a number of 3D images using active surface and deformable models plays an important role in computer vision especially medical image processing. Different powerful segmentation algorithms have been suggested to address the limitations associated with the model initialization, poor convergence to surface concavities and slow convergence rate. This paper proposes a method to improve one of the strongest and recent segmentation algorithms, namely the Decoupled Active Surface (DAS) method. We consider a gradient of wavelet edge extracted image and local phase coherence as external energy to extract more information from images and we use curvature integral as internal energy to focus on high curvature region extraction. Similarly, we use resampling of points and a line search for point selection to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. We further employ an estimation of the desired object as an initialization for the active surface model. A number of tests and experiments have been done and the results show the improvements with regards to the extracted surface accuracy and computational time of the presented algorithm compared with the best and recent active surface models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Boundary surface extraction of 3D regions in 3D images has many applications in different fields of computer vision such as object tracking, surface reconstruction, feature extraction, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and medical image processing. Various 3D segmentation methods and algorithms have been presented to address challenges of accurate surface extraction. In general, segmentation methods can be divided into three groups: structural techniques, stochastic techniques and hybrid techniques. Structural techniques consider image regions (i.e. structural information), the stochastic methods focus on statistical analysis of data and hybrid ones use both structural and statistical information [1].One of the most powerful structural techniques is Deformable Models, which define curves, surfaces and solid bodies within an image. These models perform based on the development of an initial curve or surface under the influence of internal energy, specified within the image and external energy which is acquired from the image data [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The Decoupled Active Surface (DAS) method is a recently introduced deformable model for surface extraction of 3D images which shows promising results on different datasets by increasing the accuracy of the extracted surface, decreasing the number of model parameters, decreasing initialization sensitivity and improving high curvature regions extraction compared with conventional methods [7,8]. DAS applies external and internal energies separately and consists of a measurement update step which uses the Iterative Quasi-Random Search (IQRS) algorithm. It also utilizes a modification of measured surface based on regions curvature and a non-stationary prior [7,8]. Despite all the advantages of the DAS model, it can be optimized in different parts. In this paper we propose several modifications for the DAS model such as using appropriate energy functions to extract more information from an image, point updating based on strong criteria to increase the accuracy of the extracted surface (especially in high curvature regions), and finally using an modified and improved initial surface to speed up the algorithm convergence.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the Decoupled Active Surface (DAS) model, the proposed method is presented in Section 3, experimental results are discussed in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes this paper.One of the recent and successful methods of deformable model is Decoupled Active Surface (DAS) [7,8]. DAS is made of a triangular mesh which is defined by triangular faces,T={t1,…,tk},k∈[1,t]and vertices,v={v1,…,vj},j∈[1,q], normal vectors on each face,ntkand normal vectors in each vertices,nj. All these definitions are shown inFig. 1. Generally, the DAS algorithm consists of three steps shown inFig. 2, which is copied from [9]. Like all deformable models, the goal in DAS is to evolve a surface to minimize the total energy function defined as:(1)Etot(v)=Eint(v)+Eext(v)where,Eintis the internal energy consisting of two terms, elastic energy and thin-plate energy which preserves the surface continuity and smoothness, andEextis the external energy which leads the surface to converge toward the desired 3D object boundary. The energiesEintandEextare mathematically defined as follows:(2)Eint(v)=∫a=01∫b=01(Eelastic(v(a,b))+Ethin−plate(v(a,b)))dadb(3)Eelastic(v(a,b))=α1|∂v(a,b)∂a|2+α2|∂v(a,b)∂b|2(4)Ethin−plate(v(a,b))=β1|∂2v(a,b)∂a2|2+β2|∂2v(a,b)∂b2|2+2β3|∂∂a(∂v(a,b)∂b)|2(5)Eext(v)=∫a=01∫b=01(P(v(a,b)))dadb(6)P=−γ(g(I))2(7)g(I)=(|∇I|)where in (6), g(.) is the gradient function.αiandβiare weighting parameters used to control the strength of the model׳s tension, rigidity and the attraction that the image features have on the deformable model. Generally, these parameters are considered to be fixed values.In contrast to conventional active surface models, the DAS model consists of a visual boundary extraction using the IQRS algorithm, and a non-stationary sampling interval for the points on the surface in order to acquire a better description of the object boundary by concentrating on more vertices at high curvature regions. For this way that the DAS model does sampling (i.e. resampling stage), the model uses some special criterion and definitions. To accomplish the goal of boundary extraction, DAS defines two types of problematic triangles (i.e. tall and fat) that may be encountered/generated during the surface evolution process. The triangles whose longest edge length to the shortest edge length ratio isTh1and the largest to second largest edge length ratio is betweenTh2toTh3are termed as tall triangles. Other triangles that are not labeled as tall triangles, but have the length of the longest edge length greater thanTh4are considered as fat triangles. AllThithresholds are user defined. Both tall and fat triangles can lead the deformable model to an unstable state, if not refined at an earlier iteration. To resample tall triangles, two vertices are generated on the two long edges of the tall triangle and these two vertices will be connected by an edge. For fat triangles, a vertex is added on the longest edge and this vertex should be connected to the vertex opposite to this longest edge. The resampling procedure of DAS is shown inFigs. 3 and 4.
