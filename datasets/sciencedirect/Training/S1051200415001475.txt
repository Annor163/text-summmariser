This paper considers the problem of joint detection and tracking in mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments by using received signal strength (RSS) measurements. A nonlinear target tracking model with multiple switching parameters has been proposed, in which multiple independent Markov chains are used to describe the switching of target maneuvers and the transition of LOS/NLOS measurements, respectively. Based on the proposed tracking model, a multi-sensor multiple model Bernoulli filter (MMBF) has been developed by employing the random finite set theory which can formulate the joint detection and tracking in a unified framework. To derive a closed-form expression to the MMBF, the Gaussian mixture implementations have been provided by applying the extended Kalman filter technique. A numerical example is provided involving tracking a maneuvering target by a sensor network with 30 nodes. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed filter.AcronymsLOSLine-of-sightAOAAngle-of-arrivalNLOSNon-line-of-sightRFSRandom finite setRSSReceived signal strengthPHDProbability hypothesis densityMMBFMultiple model Bernoulli filterIMMInteracting multiple modelWSNWireless sensor networksEKFExtended Kalman filterTOATime-of-arrivalUKFUnscented Kalman filterTDOATime-difference-of-arrivalCKFCubature Kalman filter

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSN) has received great attention in many fields such as mobile station localization, search-rescue, robotic navigation, and autonomous surveillance [1–5]. Target tracking can be viewed as a sequential localization problem via noisy measurements. Representative signal models in a WSN includes time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA), received signal strength (RSS) and their data fusion schemes. Due to its low complexity and low cost of devices, RSS-based target tracking has been one of the most popular methods in a WSN and many algorithms have been developed in [6–8].As new targets may appear or disappear randomly in the surveillance region, tracking multi-target involves estimating an unknown and time-varying number of targets from a given set of measurements with uncertain origin. Many tracking algorithms have been proposed based on data association strategies such as the nearest neighbor, the strongest neighbor, the joint probabilistic data association and the multiple hypothesis tracking [9]. Due to its combinatorial nature, a high computational load is often required to resolve the data association problem in multi-target tracking algorithms. Two well-known alternative formulations that avoid data association are symmetric measurement equations [10] and the random finite sets (RFS) [11]. In the RFS formulation, the target states and measurements are represented by two different random finite sets, and as a consequence, the multi-target tracking problem can be addressed in a rigorous Bayesian estimation framework based on the finite set statistics theory [11]. A common method is the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter [12] and two typical implementations have been proposed including the sequential Monte Carlo [13] and the Gaussian mixture [14]. Many extensions have been also developed for different tracking scenarios [15–22].For jointly detecting and tracking a single target, the Bernoulli RFS has been one of the most important candidates by representing the target state as a set that can take on either an empty set or a singleton, and the resulting algorithm is referred to as the Bernoulli filter. As the Bernoulli filter in a general nonlinear/non-Gaussian case has no analytic solution, numerical implementations have been proposed such as the particle filter method [23] and the Gaussian mixture method [24]. In [25], the Bernoulli particle filter has been applied to jointly detect and track an extended target. In [26], the problem of joint detection and tracking of a target using multi-static Doppler-only measurements has been investigated and a multi-sensor Bernoulli particle filter has been developed. The Bernoulli filter has been extended to track multiple targets, which is also known as the cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli filter [27–34].It should be pointed out that the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation might occur in a WSN whenever there are obstacles blocking the direct radio signal path between the target and a sensor node, especially in the indoor environment or an urban region. The NLOS propagation often induce large localization errors if not addressed, and therefore, special techniques are required to mitigate the NLOS effects. In the past few decades, many strategies have been proposed for mitigating the NLOS errors such as hypothesis test [35], statistical analysis [36], and robust parameter estimation [37]; see [38] for more detailed discussions on these methods. In [39], a two-state Markov chain has been utilized to describe the switching behavior of the line-of-sight (LOS) and the NLOS, and an estimator has been developed by combining the interacting multiple model (IMM) approach with the Kalman filtering technique. It has been shown that the proposed estimator can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects on the measurement errors. Based on this model, the data fusion of TOA and RSS measurements is employed to improve the location accuracy in [40]. The results are further extended to approximate the nonlinear RSS measurement by using fuzzy estimation techniques in [41]. Similar idea has also been adopted to track a mobile terminal by using the M-estimation approach [42]. In [43], a distributed multiple model estimator has been developed for simultaneous localization and tracking. However, little research has been done for joint target detection and tracking in a WSN. In [44], the RSS-based target tracking in sensor networks has been studied by the RFS approach and the Bernoulli filter has been developed in [45]. The problem of joint detection and tracking in mixed LOS and NLOS environment has not been studied.In this paper, we attempt to apply the Bernoulli filter to address the problem of joint detection and tracking using RSS measurements in mixed LOS and NLOS environment. To address the effects of target maneuvers and NLOS errors, a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters has been proposed as the tracking model. Based on the RFS theory, we show how the multiple switching parameters can be used in the Bernoulli filter. By using the sequential estimation approach to address multiple sensor measurements, a multi-sensor multiple model Bernoulli filter (MMBF) has been developed and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique is adopted to give Gaussian mixture implementations to the multi-sensor MMBF. The proposed filter can be considered as an extension of the filter in [45] with multiple model features. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filter.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The problem of joint detection and tracking using RSS measurements in mixed LOS and NLOS environments is formulated in Section 2. The multi-sensor MMBF is developed and the Gaussian mixture implementations to the proposed filter are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter. Conclusion and future work are drawn in Section 5.Consider a moving target on a two-dimensional (2D) plane with state vectorxk=[px,kpy,kvx,kvy,k]T, where(px,kpy,k)and(vx,kvy,k)denote the position and the velocity components, respectively. Since the target dynamic is not known as a prior, a single motion model might not be enough to represent the target dynamics. To indicate the target maneuvers, the target dynamic is described by the following jump Markov system(1)xk=Fk−1(γk)xk−1+Gk−1(γk)wk−1(γk)where k is the time index.γkis a first-order M-state time-homogeneous Markov chain with known transition probability matrixΠ(1)=[πmn(1)]M×Mandπmn(1)≜Pr{γk=n|γk−1=m}.Fk−1(γk)andGk−1(γk)are the system matrices which can be used to represent the target motions such as the constant velocity model and the coordinate turn model. The process noisewk−1(γk)is zero-mean white Gaussian with covariance matrixQk−1(γk). Note that the nonlinear dynamic models can be also used to indicate the target motions.A set of radio sensors that provide the signal power measurements are used throughout this paper. The target-originated power measurement from the s-th sensor can be represented in a logarithmic form(2)zk,s=K−10ηlog⁡(dk,s)+uk,s(3)dk,s=(px,k−κx,s)2+(py,k−κy,s)2,s=1,2,⋯,Nwhere N is the number of sensors.(κx,k,κy,k)is the position of the s-th sensor. K andη∈[2,4]denote the transmission power and the path loss exponent, respectively. They are dependent on the radio environment and the antenna characteristics. They are assumed to be known parameters in this paper.dk,sis the relative distance between the target and the s-th sensor.uk,sis the measurement noise which can be used to describe the LOS and the NLOS measurement errors.In the LOS environment, the measurement is corrupted by the system measurement noiseεk,s, which can be modeled as zero-mean white Gaussian noise, i.e.,εk,s∼N(εk,s;0,Rk,s(1)). In the NLOS environment, the measurement is corrupted by two sources of errors: the system measurement noiseεk,sand the measurement bias errorek,s. As stated in [39], the bias error can be modeled as a biased distribution, i.e.,ek,s∼N(ek,s;μk,s,Σk,s). It is also assumed that the system measurement noise and the bias error are independent. Then the measurement noise can be represented by(4)uk,s={εk,s,LOS conditionεk,s+ek,s,NLOS conditionTo indicate the transition of the LOS and the NLOS measurement errors, a two state time-homogeneous Markov chainλk,sis used. Without loss of generality,λk,s=1is used to represent the LOS condition andλk,s=2is used to represent the NLOS condition. The transition probability matrix ofλk,sis assumed to beΠ(2)=[πpq(2)]2×2withπpq(2)≜Pr{λk,s=q|λk−1,s=p}. It should be pointed out that the two-state Markov chainλk,sis dependent on the sensor node since the target might be in the LOS condition for one sensor node but in the NLOS condition for another one.Based on the above formulation, the target dynamics and the measurement equations can be represented in a compact form(5)xk=Fk−1(γk)xk−1+Gk−1(γk)wk−1(γk)(6)zk,s=hs(xk)+uk,s(λk,s),s=1,2,⋯,Nwherehs(xk)=K−10ηlog⁡(dk,s)is the nonlinear measurement function. The measurement noiseuk,s(λk,s)is assumed to be zero-mean white Gaussian with covariance matrixRk,s(1)in the LOS condition, i.e.,uk,s1∼N(uk,s;0,Rk,s(1)). It is assumed to be white Gaussian with meanμk,sand covariance matrixRk,s(2)in the NLOS condition, i.e.,uk,s2∼N(uk,s;μk,s,Rk,s(2)). It can be seen that the proposed tracking model has been formulated as a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters. The transition probabilities of the Markov chains can be determined by using the maximum likelihood estimation approach [46,47], which is out of the scope of this paper. For notational simplicity, the notationAk−1(γk)is abbreviated asAk−1mforγk=m.As the target may enter and exit the surveillance region at random instances, it is important to consider techniques that can jointly detect and track a target. The RFS theory has been used to pose the joint detection and tracking as a Bayes optimal filtering problem with finite set valued states and observations.Generally, an RFS is a random variable that takes value as unordered finite set. An RFS X is completed specified by its cardinality distributionρ(n)and a family of symmetric joint distributionspn(x1,⋯,xn)that characterize the distribution of its elements. By the finite set statistics theory, the probability density function of an RFS X is uniquely determined by(7)f({x1,⋯,xn})=n!⋅ρ(n)⋅pn(x1,⋯,xn)The set integral is defined as(8)∫f(X)δX=f(∅)+∑n=1∞1n!∫f({x1,⋯,xn})dx1⋯dxnIn the community of target tracking, the Bernoulli RFS has been adopted to represent the target state of appearance and disappearance. The probability density function of the Bernoulli RFS X is given by(9)f(X)={1−q,ifX=∅q⋅r(x),ifX={x}0,if|X|≥2where q is the probability of X being a singleton andr(x)is the corresponding probability density function of its element.By substituting (9) into (8), it can be seen that the set integral reduces to(10)∫f(X)δX=f(∅)+∫f({x})dx=1−q+q∫r(x)dx=1In order to jointly detect and track a single target in the surveillance region, it is convenient to introduce a binary variableϵk∈{0,1}referred to as the target existence. The convention is thatϵk=1refers to the target appearance whileϵk=0refers to the target disappearance. The dynamics ofϵkis modeled as a two state Markov chain with known transition probability matrix(11)Π=[1−pbpb1−psps]wherepb=P{ϵk=1|ϵk=0}is the probability of target birth during the sampling interval, andps=P{ϵk=0|ϵk=1}is the probability of target survival during the sampling interval. Thus, it is natural to model the target state as a Bernoulli RFSXkwhich is empty ifϵk=0and a singletonXk=xifϵk=1. If the target is present, it is assumed that it is a Markov process with known transitional densityfx(x|x′). To illustrate the behavior of target appearance and disappearance, the RFS model from time k tok+1is shown in Fig. 1.The aim of this paper is to address the problem of joint detection and tracking a maneuvering target using RSS measurements in mixed LOS/NLOS environments. By representing the target state as a Bernoulli RFS, our purpose is to develop a recursive filtering algorithm with respect to the tracking model (5)–(6). As the tracking model has been formulated as a jump Markov nonlinear system with multiple switching parameters, we attempt to propose a multi-sensor MMBF in the RFS framework.As the tracking model involves multiple switching parametersγk,λk,s(s=1,⋯,N), the traditional Bernoulli RFS state is augmented by the switching parameters, i.e.,ξk=(Xk,Γk,Λk), where(Xk,Γk,Λk)=(xk,γk,λk)withλk={λk,1,⋯,λk,N}if the target is present. The Bernoulli RFSξkshould be an empty set if the target is not present. Based on the finite set statistics theory, the predicted and updated posterior density functions can be expressed as follows(12)pk|k−1(ξk|Z1:k−1)=Φ(ξk|∅)pk−1(∅|Z1:k−1)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫Φ(ξk|xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)pk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1|Z1:k−1)dxk−1(13)pk(ξk|Z1:k)=φ(zk|ξk)pk|k−1(ξk|Z1:k−1)p(zk|Z1:k−1)wherepk−1(ξk−1|Z1:k−1)is the posterior density function at time stepk−1.pk|k−1(ξk|Z1:k−1)andpk(ξk|Z1:k)are the predicted and the updated posterior density functions, respectively.φ(zk|ξk)is the measurement likelihood function withzk=[zk,1,⋯,zk,N]Tbeing the measurements generated from all the sensors at time step k.Z1:k={z1,⋯,zk}denotes the cumulative set from all the sensors during the sampling interval[1,k].Φ(ξk|ξk−1)is the transitional density function defined by(14)Φ(ξk|∅)={1−pb,ifξk=∅pbb(ξk),ifξk=(xk,γk,λk)0,if|ξk|≥2(15)Φ(ξk|ξk−1)={1−ps,ifξk=∅psf(ξk|ξk−1),ifξk=(xk,γk,λk)0,if|ξk|≥2Note thatb(ξk)is the birth density to describe the target dynamics if target appears.f(ξk|ξk−1)is the transitional density to describe the target dynamics if the target still exists during the sampling interval.φ(zk|ξk)is a function of the Bernoulli stateξk. Since the sensors are independent conditional onxk, the combined likelihood accounting for all sensor measurements is(16)φ(zk|ξk)=∏s=1Nφ(zk,s|ξk)whereφ(zk,s|ξk)is a function ofξkfor the s-th sensor as follows(17)zk,s={hs(xk)+uk,s(λk,s),ifξk=(xk,γk,λk)ψk,s,ifξk=∅Note that only measurement noiseψk,sis generated if the target is not present.Under the above assumptions, an exact recursion can be derived as follows.Proposition 1If the posterior densityfk−1at time stepk−1is Bernoulli given byfk−1={qk−1,rk−1}, then the predicted densityfk|k−1is also Bernoulli given byfk|k−1={qk|k−1,rk|k−1}where(18)qk|k−1=pb(1−qk−1)+psqk−1(19)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)=1qk|k−1[pb(1−qk−1)b(xk.γk,λk)+psqk−1∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫fx(xk|xk−1,γk)fγ(γk|γk−1)fλ(λk|λk−1)rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)dxk−1]wherefx(xk|xk−1,γk)is the transitional density of the target state.fγ(γk|γk−1)andfλ(λk|λk−1)denote the transition probabilities of the Markov chainsγkandλk, respectively.Moreover, the updated densityfkis also Bernoulli given byfk={qk,rk}(20)qk=qk|k−1Qk(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)+qk|k−1Qk(21)rk(xk,γk,λk)=1Qk∏s=1Nφ(zk,s|xk,λk,s)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)where(22)Qk=∑γk=1M∑λk,1=12⋯∑λk,N=12∫∏s=1Nφ(zk,s|xk,λk,s)p(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k−1)dxkProofThe predicted density of the Bayes filter in the RFS framework can be derived by using the set integral (8)(23)pk|k−1(ξk|Z1:k−1)=Φ(ξk|∅)pk−1(∅|Z1:k−1)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫Φ(ξk|xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)pk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1|Z1:k−1)dxk−1Let us first solve (23) for the caseξk=∅. Substituting (14) and (15) into (23) yields(24)pk|k−1(∅|Z1:k−1)=Φ(∅|∅)pk−1(∅|Z1:k−1)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫Φ(∅|xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)pk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1|Z1:k−1)dxk−1=(1−pb)(1−qk−1)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫(1−ps)qk−1rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)dxk−1=(1−pb)(1−qk−1)+(1−ps)qk−1Next, we solve (23) for the caseξk={(xk,γk,λk)}. We have from (14)–(15) that(25)pk|k−1(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k−1)=Φ(xk,γk,λk|∅)pk−1(∅|Z1:k−1)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫Φ(xk,γk,λk|xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)pk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1|Z1:k−1)dxk−1=pb(1−qk−1)b(xk,γk,λk)+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫psqk−1f(xk,γk,λk|xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)dxk−1=pb(1−qk−1)b(xk,γk,λk)+psqk−1+∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫fx(xk|xk−1,γk)fγ(γk|γk−1)fλ(λk|λk−1)rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)dxk−1where the fact that the Markov chainsγkandλk,sare independent is used.Now based on the definition of the probability density function for a Bernoulli RFS (9), we can get(26)qk|k−1=1−pk|k−1(∅|Z1:k−1)=1−(1−pb)(1−qk−1)+(1−ps)qk−1=pb(1−qk−1)+psqk−1(27)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)=pk|k−1(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k−1)qk|k−1=1qk|k−1[pb(1−qk−1)b(xk.γk,λk)+psqk−1∑γk−1=1M∑λk−1,1=12⋯∑λk−1,N=12∫fx(xk|xk−1,γk)fγ(γk|γk−1)fλ(λk|λk−1)rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)dxk−1]Recall that the update density follows from the Bayes rule (13), we have(28)pk(ξk|Z1:k)=φ(zk|ξk)pk|k−1(ξk|Z1:k−1)p(zk|Z1:k−1)wherep(zk|Z1:k−1)can be derived by using the definition of a set integral(29)p(zk|Z1:k−1)=fz(zk|∅)pk|k−1(∅|Z1:k−1)+∑γk=1M∑λk,1=12⋯∑λk,N=12∫f(zk|xk,γk,λk)pk|k−1(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k−1)dxk=(1−qk|k−1)φ(zk|∅)+qk|k−1∑γk=1M∑λk,1=12⋯∑λk,N=12∫φ(zk|xk,γk,λk)p(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k−1)dxkThen, the updated density can be expressed for the caseξk=∅(30)pk(∅|Z1:k)=φ(zk|∅)pk|k−1(∅|Z1:k−1)(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)+qk|k−1Qk=(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)+qk|k−1Qkand for the caseξk={(xk,γk,λk)}(31)pk(xk,γk,λk|Z1:k)=qk|k−1φ(zk|xk,γk,λk)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)+qk|k−1QkNow based on the definition of the probability density function for a Bernoulli RFS (9), we can get(32)qk=1−pk(∅|Z1:k)=qk|k−1Qk(1−qk|k−1)φ0(zk)+qk|k−1Qkrk(xk,γk,λk)=pk(xk,γk,λk|Zk)qk=1Qk∏s=1Nφ(zk,s|xk,λk,s)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)This completes the proof.  □Remark 1Note that the probabilityqkis not dependent on the switching parameters. This is due to the fact that the target appearance and disappearance are not dependent on the behavior of the target dynamics and the LOS/NLOS measurements. However, the probability density functionrkis dependent on the switching parameters since different modes of the Markov chains are used to estimate the target state.Remark 2The proposed multi-sensor MMBF simplifies to the multi-sensor Bernoulli filter in [45] when the multiple model feature is not adopted. It is worth mentioning that the proposed filter differs from the multi-sensor Bernoulli in [24] since the clutter is not considered in the proposed filter. Although the Markov chain has been used to describe target maneuvers in the RFS framework [29,48–50], the switching of LOS/NLOS measurement errors has not been addressed in the literature.The Gaussian mixture implementations are proposed to give a closed-form solution to the multi-sensor MMBF (18)–(21). As the updated posterior densityrkis derived by multiple sensor measurements (32), the sequential estimation approach is used as follows.Assume that the predicted densityfk|k−1={qk|k−1,rk|k−1}has been obtained, then the first sensor measurement is used to calculate the updated densityfk(1)={qk(1),rk(1)}. By treating the updated densityfk(1)={qk(1),rk(1)}as the predicted density, the second sensor measurement is used to calculate the updated densityfk(2)={qk(2),rk(2)}and so on until all the sensor measurements are addressed. The updated density derived by the N-th sensorfk(N)={qk(N),rk(N)}is used for the next filtering step, i.e.,qk=qk(N)andrk=rk(N).For the convenience of further development, the tracking model (5)–(6) can be expressed by(33)f(xk|xk−1,γk)=N(xk;Fk−1(γk)xk−1,Gk−1(γk)Qk−1(γk)Gk−1T(γk))(34)φ(zk,s|xk,λk,s)=N(zk,s;hs(xk),Rk(λk,s))In order to give the Gaussian mixture implementations to the multi-sensor MMBF, the birth density at time step k is assumed to be of the form(35)b(xk,γk,λk,s)=∑i=1Jk,bn,qwk,bn,qN(xk;xˆk,bn,q,Pk,bn,q)wherewk,bn,q,xˆk,bn,qandPk,bn,qdenote the parameters of the i-th Gaussian term forγk=nandλk,s=q.Jk,bn,qis the number of Gaussian terms.Assume that the posterior density at time stepk−1can be represented as a mixture of Gaussian terms as follows(36)rk−1(xk−1,γk−1,λk−1)=∑i=1Jk−1m,pwk−1,im,pN(xk−1;xˆk−1,im,p,Pk−1,im,p)wherewk−1,im,p,xˆk,im,pandPk,im,pdenote the parameters of the i-th Gaussian term forγk−1=mandλk−1,s=m.Jk−1m,pis the number of Gaussian terms.Then the predicted density can be derived by substituting (33)–(35) into (19)(37)qk|k−1=pb(1−qk−1)+psqk−1(38)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)=pb(1−qk−1)qk|k−1∑i=1Jk,bn,qwk,bn,qN(xk;xˆk,bn,q,Pk,bn,q)+psqk−1qk|k−1∑i=1Jk−1m,p∑m=1N∑p=12wk−1,im,pπmn(1)πpq(2)×N(xk;xˆk|k−1,im,n,p,Pk|k−1,im,n,p)where the predicted estimates are(39)xˆk|k−1,im,n,p=Fk−1nxˆk−1,im,p(40)Pk|k−1,im,n,p=Fk−1nPk−1,im,p[Fk−1n]T+Gk−1nQk−1n[Gk−1n]TIt can be seen that the predicted densityrk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)in (38) is still a Gaussian mixture form. Assume thatrk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)can be expressed in a compact form as follows(41)rk|k−1(xk,γk,λk)=∑i=1Jk|k−1n,qwk|k−1,in,qN(xk|k−1;xˆk|k−1,in,q,Pk|k−1,in,q)Substituting (34) and (41) into (20)–(21) and using EKF technique to address the first sensor measurement yields(42)qk(1)=∑i=1Jk|k−1∑m=1N∑p=12qk|k−1wk|k−1,in,qϒk,in,q(zk)(1−qk|k−1)f0(zk)+qk|k−1∑i=1Jk|k−1∑m=1N∑p=12wk|k−1,im,pϒk,im,p(zk)(43)rk(1)(xk,γk,λk,1)=∑i=1Jk|k−1n,q∑n=1N∑q=12wk|k,in,qN(xk;xˆk|k,in,q,Pk|k,in,q)where the updated estimates are(44)wk|k,in,q=wk|k−1,in,qϒk,in,q(zk,1)∑i=1Jk|k−1n,q∑m=1N∑p=12wk|k−1,im,pϒk,im,p(zk)(45)xˆk|k,in,q=xˆk|k−1,in,q+Kk,in,q[zk,1−h1(xˆk|k−1,in,q)](46)Pk|k,in,q=Pk|k−1,in,q−Kk,in,qSk|k−1,in,q[Kk,in,q]T(47)Kk,in,q=Pk|k−1,in,q[Hk,in,q]T[Sk|k−1,in,q]−1(48)Sk|k−1,in,q=Hk,in,qPk|k−1,in,q[Hk,in,q]T+Rk(q)(49)ϒk,in,q(zk,1)=N(zk,1;h(xˆk|k−1,in,q),Sk|k−1,in,q)Based on the idea of sequential estimation, the estimates at time step k can be derived after all the sensor measurements are addressed.For clarify, the proposed filter is summarized in Algorithm 1.Remark 3As the number of Gaussian components increases without bound as time progresses, the pruning scheme is required after the updated step and a simple pruning procedure has been provided by truncating components that have weak weights [14]. Another feature of the proposed filter is that other nonlinear filtering techniques can be used instead of the EKF such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the cubature Kamlan filter (CKF).In the proposed tracking scenario, 30 sensor nodes are randomly deployed over a field of[080]×[080]in meters and a maneuvering target moves in this field. The target trajectory and the locations of sensor nodes by one trial are shown in Fig. 2. To indicate the target maneuvers, the target dynamics is described by a coordinated turn model(50)xk=[10sin⁡(ωT)ω−1−cos⁡(ωT)ω011−cos⁡(ωT)ωsin⁡(ωT)ω00cos⁡(ωT)−sin⁡(ωT)00sin⁡(ωT)cos⁡(ωT)]xk−1+[T2200T22T00T]wk−1(ω)where ω denotes the turn rate andT=1sis the sampling period. Three motion models corresponding to different turn rates0∘/s,8∘/sand−8∘/sare used, and the switching between three models is governed by a first order Markov chain with known transition probabilityπii(1)=0.8(i=1,2,3),πij(1)=0.1(i≠j). The process noisewk−1(ω)is assumed to be zero-mean white Gaussian with covarianceQk−1(1)=0.01I2andQk−1(2)=Qk−1(3)=0.09I2.As shown in Fig. 2, the target starts at the location(2020). The target appears at time 5 s and disappears at time 85 s. The initial velocity is(1.20.2)and the target starts to make a nearly constant velocity motion between 5 and 15 s; a coordinate turn motion with turn rate8∘/sbetween 16 and 35 s; a coordinate turn motion with turn rate−8∘/sbetween 36 and 65 s; and resumes a nearly constant velocity motion for another 20 s. To illustrate the detection of target appearance and disappearance, the total number of simulation time steps is set to be 90 s.For the RSS measurements, the transmission power is taken to beK=9dBmand the path loss exponent isη=2.5. The variances of the LOS measurement noise and the NLOS measurement noise are taken to beRk,s(1)=64andRk,s(2)=100, respectively. The bias of the NLOS measurement error is assumed to beμk,s=−5. The occurrence probability of the NLOS measurement error is taken to bePNLOS=0.5for each sensor. The transition probabilities of the Markov chainλk,sare set to beπ11(2)=π22(2)=0.9andπ12(2)=π21(2)=0.1. To reduce the computational cost, not all the sensor measurements are used, but only four strongest received signals are adopted for tracking the target.In the simulations, the survival probability and the birth probability are set to beps=0.98andpb=0.02, respectively. The initial target existence probability is taken to beq1=0.1. The birth density is assumed to be identical for all modes of the Markov chainsγkandλk,s(51)b(xk,γk,λk,s)=0.1N(xk;xˆk,bn,q,Pk,bn,q)wherexˆk,bn,q=[202000]TandPk,bn,q=100I4.As in [14], the pruning threshold is taken asTTh=0.0001, the merging thresholdUTh=5, the weight thresholdwTh=0.004and the maximum number of Gaussian termsJmax=10. To compare the tracking performance, the criterion known as optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric is used for performance evaluation. As stated in [51], the OSPA distance between two finite sets X and Y with cardinality of at most one is defined as follows:(52)dOSPA(c)(X,Y)={0,ifX=Y=∅min⁡{||x−y||,c},ifX={x},Y={y}c,ifX={x},Y=∅orX=∅,Y={y}where c is the cut-off parameter determining the relative weighting of the penalties assigned to cardinality and localization errors. For more details see [51].For notational simplicity, the proposed filter is shortly denoted by TMM in the figures. The simulations results are derived from 500 Monte Carlo runs. The position estimates of the proposed filter for one trial are shown in Fig. 2, where the simulation results suggest that the proposed filter can provide accurate tracking performance for almost all the time. The estimated existence probabilityqkis shown versus time in Fig. 3, which suggests that the target appearance and disappearance can be detected accurately at time 5 s and 85 s.In Fig. 4, the OSPA distance withc=100is presented versus time. To illustrate the effects of target maneuvers and NLOS measurement errors, the proposed filter is compared with four multiple model Bernoulli filters (shortly denoted by MM-1, MM-2, MM-3 and MM-Id). The MM-1 refers to the filter without using multiple target dynamic models and only the constant velocity model is used to represent target motions (i.e., only the coordinate turn rateω=0is used). But the Markov chainλk,sis still used to mitigate NLOS measurement errors for each sensor. The MM-2 refers to the filter without using multiple models for the LOS and NLOS measurement errors and only the LOS measurement noise is used (i.e., only the measurement noise varianceRk,s(1)=64is used). But the Markov chainγkis still used to represent the target maneuvers. The MM-3 refers to the filter with known LOS and NLOS measurement errors at each time step, and only the multiple target dynamic models are used. The MM-Id refers to the filter with multiple target dynamic models, where the NLOS identification approach is adopted to mitigate NLOS measurement errors [52,53].It can be observed that the proposed filter performs better than the MM-1 and the MM-2 filters. This is due to the fact the unknown target maneuvers and the LOS/NLOS measurement errors are addressed in a unified framework in the proposed filter. An important feature is that the target maneuver plays a more important role than the LOS/NLOS measurement errors for the tracking performance. The proposed filter also performs better than the MM-Id filter, which might be due to the fact that the NLOS measurement errors cannot always be identified accurately. In addition, the proposed filter achieves almost identical accuracy with the MM-3 filter which means the NLOS measurement errors can be mitigated effectively by the proposed filter.To further evaluate the performance of the proposed filter with respect to the occurrence probability of NLOS measurement errors, the averaged OSPA with different occurrence probabilities are shown in Fig. 5. The following features can be deduced from the simulation results. Firstly, the higher the occurrence probability of the NLOS, the higher tracking errors of the filter becomes. Secondly, the MM-1 filter is the worst since the target maneuvers are not considered in the target dynamic models. To mitigate the NLOS effects, the performance of the filters with Markov chain models is better than that with the NLOS identification approach since the NLOS measurement errors might not be always identified. Thirdly, the MM-2 filter performs slightly better than the proposed TMM filter with low occurrence probability of NLOS, which is due to the fact that almost all the measurements are in LOS condition. However, the proposed TMM filter performs slightly better than the MM-2 filter when the occurrence probability is larger than 0.6. Fourthly, the performance of the proposed TMM filter is close to the MM-3 filter with known LOS/NLOS measurement errors. Thus, a modest conclusion can be drawn that the NLOS measurement errors can be mitigated effectively by the proposed TMM filter. Moreover, by comparing the performance of the MM-2, the MM-3 and the proposed TMM filters, it can be seen that the tracking performance is not severely affected by the NLOS measurement errors.To evaluate the computational requirement of the proposed algorithm, the averaged CPU Time is computed in MATLAB 7.1 on a 2.80-GHz 4 CPU Pentium-based computer operating under Windows XP (Professional). The proposed TMM filter consumed approximately 1.89 s per sample run over 90 time steps whereas the MM-1 filter consumed 0.36 s, the MM-2 filter consumed 0.64 s, the MM-3 filter consumed 0.62 s and the MM-Id consumed 0.65 s. This is reasonable since 6 filters are used for each sensor measurements in the proposed filter while 2 filters are used in the MM-1 filter and 3 filters are used in the MM-2, the MM-3 and the MM-Id filters.
