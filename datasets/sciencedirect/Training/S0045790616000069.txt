@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The most commonly used and recommended scheme for the present and the future wireless communication applications is the Code Division Multiple access scheme (CDMA). The reason is its capability to offer various advantages like ability to support many users through use of the orthogonal spreading sequence, alleviation of cross-cell interference (CCI), mitigation of multi-path fading effect etc. Direct sequence (DS) spectrum techniques form the basis of CDMA and it uses the orthogonal spreading sequence to distinguish multi-user signals. This has been a topic for deliberation in various wireless standards like IS-95 CDMA Technology, Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS) and CDMA 2000. The superior BER performance of the Multi-Carrier (MC) DS-CDMA systems has been demonstrated by Kondo and Laurence [1], in interference limited wireless channels. Mohammed S. Aljerjawi and Walaa Hamouda have demonstrated its better performance for a single carrier multi-user MIMO assisted DS-CDMA when communicating over Rayleigh Fading Channels [2]. The performance of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) Multi- user detection (MUD), in MC-DS-CDMA systems has been addressed in [3]. Zhang and Hanzo [4] have elucidated and demonstrated the characteristics of a single and MC-DS-CDMA system. The validation of the performance of successive interference cancellation technique for DS-CDMA system with transmit diversity has been carried out by Li and Aaron in [5]. Improvisation to the BER performance of multi-user transmitter pre-processing (MUTP) assisted MC-CDMA can be done by using cooperative diversity despite the situation of a mobile station (MS) far away from the base station (BS) in the context of downlink transmission. This fact was studied and demonstrated in [6]. The greater performance of the relay aided downlink (DL) DS-CDMA system with MUTP in terms of achievable BER has been explicated by Murali et al. [7].A significant improvement of the spectral efficiency of a wireless system is possible through increase in the number of antennas in the system without, however, any increase in the spectrum utilization and transmit power. A huge potential to enhance the capacity of a system is found in the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) configuration that uses a sizable number of antennas distributed in space. The two interesting features offered by MIMO configuration are spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity. The vertical Bell laboratories layered space time (VBLAST) architecture [8], transmitting multiple data streams simultaneously over all antennas, is an example of spatial multiplexing. A high data rate can be provided by VBLAST-MIMO without increasing the bandwidth and also cost of substantial decoding complexity. But, inter-channel interference (ICI) and inter-antenna interference are causes for performance degradation in this system.The space-time block codes (STBC) [9,10], deployed for achievement of maximum attainable diversity order is an example of spatial diversity. A full rate and diversity can be provided by the Alamouti orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) [9], for two transmit antennas. However, when the number of antennas is increased, the overall system performance is affected due to channel correlation properties. Channel correlation occurs due to small antenna spacing and rich scattering environment in the wireless channel [11]. Approximately tens of wavelengths antenna spacing in the base station (BS) [12], and about half-wavelength antenna spacing at the MS for an uni-polarized antenna are needed to achieve the desired gain for MIMO systems. Deployment of multiple antennas is not an easy task in communication environment. Due to spacing limitations however, this spacing issue is addressed by a dual-polarized antenna wherein, a single dual-polarized antenna replaces two spatially separated antennas. Thus a high degree of spectral efficiency is obtained by utilizing a smaller number of physically reliable antenna elements. In the dual polarized structure, the user can simultaneously transmit two independent symbols on the same carrier frequency and bandwidth through the orthogonal polarization technique. The signal energy present in the orthogonal polarization is very small when compared to the energy in polarization of the transmitting antenna, under general LOS channel conditions. SNR penalties and multiplexing deficits are incurred by single-polarized antenna array configurations of MIMO systems when compared with dual-polarized cases. This is particularly pertaining to LOS channel conditions and for random orientations of the mobile antenna. This causes a reduced signal power level at the mobile unit which significantly degrades the BER performance. The polarization diversity gain is evaluated for both LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) environments and is compared with space diversity, for different inclinations of the mobile antenna [13]. The mobile antenna inclination angle is reported as not having any effect on the polarization diversity gain, regardless of the polarization diversity scheme applied. The reduction of the installation cost and antenna element spacing is the main motivation for suing the dual-polarized antennas in multiple antenna system configurations.Cross polar discrimination (XPD) and envelope correlation coefficient can be used to describe the characteristics of polarization diversity. The power imbalance between the co-polarized and cross-polarized pairs has been shown to be typically 6 - 14dB through experimental studies on the measurements of XPD [14,15]. The density of the obstacles in the propagation environment which causes depolarization of the signal influences the XPD parameter value. This depolarization causes coupling of certain energy into the orthogonal polarization. Observations show an increase in XPD for LOS environments and a decrease with increase in distance [14]. Even in a LOS scenario, the correlation coefficient is found to be lower than 0.7 [16]. Almost the entire energy lost due to antenna inclination angle on the vertical branches, can be recovered from the horizontal branch [17, Table-I]. Sub-channel power losses, are present in the MIMO configuration with dual-polarized antenna structure that causes a reduction in performance due to an imbalance of power between orthogonal sub-channels, for an inclination angleα=0. The performance of a dual-polarized MIMO-Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) using an iterative decoding algorithm has been explicated in [18]. The authors have shown that, a higher throughput can be obtained through consideration of the DSTTD system even with a reduced size of the mobile unit. In [19], the authors have investigated the capacity analysis for Uplink transmission in IEEE 802.22 cognitive Radio network standard. The authors in [20] have investigated the performance of IDMA using turbo code for the mitigation of multiple access interference(MAI) and CCI in the context of DL communication.The performance of dual and triply polarized MIMO systems for SDMA has been investigated in literature [12]. In this paper, we make a study and analyze the performance of a triply-polarized MIMO–CDMA system over correlated frequency-selective channels. We also implement a channel encoder using turbo code at the transmitter and a turbo decoding algorithm which is based on Log- maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) that considers both extrinsic and intrinsic information to estimate the desired user's signals. Furthermore BER performance of a single cell multi-user coded triply-Polarized MIMO–CDMA system is evaluated with MMSE receiver, considering the realistic channel model based on the Stanford University Interim (SUI) and Long-term Evolution (LTE) channel specifications.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: System configuration is described in Section-II. The detection algorithm is illustrated in Section-III. The performance of the proposed system is discussed in Section-IV. Section –V details the conclusions.In this contribution, we consider single cell multi-user downlink communication which supports K users. Fig. 1describes the single cell multi-user MIMO–CDMA system with triply polarized antennas. Each of K user is equipped withNrtriply-polarized receive antennas while the base station is equipped withNttriply-Polarized transmit antennas. Let input bit stream be expressed as(1)uk=[uk1,uk2,…,ukm]T,k=1,2,…,KThen the bit stream is encoded by channel encoderLet the transmitted bits stream contain m bits after channel encoding be denoted bydkand is transmitted to the kth user from the base station (BS).where(2)dk=[dk1,dk2,…,dkm]T,k=1,2,…,KThe input bit stream is then interleaved by a random interleaverπto combat burst errors. Then the bit streamdkj,j=1,2,3,…,mis spread with the aid of Nc-length user-specific orthogonal spreading sequence ckexpressed by(3)ck=1Nc[ck0,ck1,…,ck(Nc−1)]TThen, in the context of m bits, Ncm × m dimensional spreading matrix can be expressed as,(4)Ck=diag{ck,ck,…,ck}=Im⊗ck,k=1,2,…,Kwhere(5)Ncm=Nc·mcomponentmatrixWe consider the hadamard spreading sequence in order to support more-user population.This user-specific spreading matrix is used to obtain the spread sequence of the kth user having length vector Ncm and is be expressed as(6)Ckdk,k=1,2,…,KThen all the user's signals are summed to obtainxWhere(7)x=∑k=1KCkdkThen the sum signals are transmitted using VBLAST architecture by triply-polarized antennas.Now, considering a single triply-polarized antenna at the BS and MS, the channel state information matrix is defined [15] as(8)H¯¯tp=[hvvhvhhvzhhvhhhhhzhzvhzhhzz]In a wireless medium, transmitted signals reach the receiver through multipath reflections and the scattering effect. Hence, there may be coupling between orthogonal polarizations resulting in depolarization. Cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is a measure to evaluate the depolarization effects.Then the XPD for the fading part of the channel [15] is expressed as(9)XPDvh=E{|h˜vv|2}E{|h˜hv|2},(10)XPDhv=E{|h˜hh|2}E{|h˜vh|2},(11)XPDzv=E{|h˜zz|2}E{|h˜vz|2},(12)XPDvz=E{|h˜vv|2}E{|h˜zv|2},(13)XPDhz=E{|h˜hh|2}E{|h˜zh|2}and(14)XPDzh=E{|h˜zz|2}E{|h˜hz|2}Defining δ, 0 < δ ≤ 1, as the parameter which denotes the part of the radiated power that is coupled from vertical to horizontal polarization and vice versa, perfect discrimination between the vertical and horizontal polarization is possible if δ → 0 and a leakage between polarizations occurs for 0 < δ ≤ 1. Hence the XPD and δare related through Eq. (15).(15)XPD=1−(δ1+δ2)δ1+δ2,0<(δ1+δ2)≤1The XPD for the fixed component matrix of a triply polarized channel [15] is given by(16)XPDf=1−(δ1f+δ2f)δ1f+δ2f,0<(δ1f+δ2f)≤1and the normalizations factor for fixed component matrix is expressed through Eq. (17)–(19) [15](17)|h˜vv|2=|h˜hh|2=|h˜zz|2=1−(δ1f+δ2f)(18)|h˜vh|2=|h˜zv|2=|h˜hz|2=δ1f(19)|h˜hv|2=|h˜vz|2=|h˜zh|2=δ2fand the normalizations factor for the triply-polarized antennas is summarized [15] as(20)E{|h¯vv|2}=E{|h¯hh|2}=E{|h¯zz|2}=1−(δ1+δ2)(21)E{|h¯vh|2}=E{|h¯zv|2}=E{|h¯hz|2}=δ1(22)E{|h¯hv|2}=E{|h¯vz|2}=E{|h¯zh|2}=δ2Then, for the triply-polarized Nr× Nt, MIMO channel matrix is now expressed as(23)Htp=Ψtp⊙(Rrg1/2H¯¯tpRtg1/2)where(24)Ψtp=[1−ηδ1δ2δ21−ηδ1δ1δ21−η]It defines the polarization leakage matrix withη=δ1+δ2giving the condition for the symmetry such that 0 ≤ η ≤ 1. Further, in (23)Rrg1/2andRtg1/2are the receive and transmit correlation matrices, respectively, which are based on [15] and are denoted as(25)Rrg=[1γrg12γrg1Nrγrg211γrg23γrgNr1γrg321]and(26)Rtg=[1γtg12γtg1Ntγtg211γtg23γtgNt1γtg321]Whereγrgijrepresents correlation co-efficient between ith receive antenna and jth receive antenna andγtgijrepresents correlation co-efficient between ith transmit antenna and jth transmit antennaIn this contribution, we have assumed that the channel matrix that connects kth MS and BS is frequency-selective. The channel model assumed in our work is based on Standard University Interim (SUI) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel model specifications. The power delay profile for SUI and LTE channel model are summarized in the Table-1. The impulse response connecting jthreceive antenna and ith transmit is defined as(27)hji(t)=∑l=1Lhjil∂(t−τl)Where Lrepresents number of paths between jth receive antenna and ith transmit antennaThe received vector component r at the kth MS(28)r=Hktpx+nkwhereHktpis the kth user triply-Polarized channel matrix (3×3 MIMO profile) considering XPD, receive and transmit correlation matrices and polarization leakage matrix and is constructed based on Eq.

Applying the MMSE-OSIC rule, we rank a set of all possible symbol decisions to the pre-computation of weight vectors [21]. We assume the availability of the perfect channel state information (CSI) at each MS. As we consider the Gaussian noise variance factor, MMSE-OSIC suppresses the Gaussian noise in addition to multi-user interference. The weight matrix in this case can be expressed as(31)W¯=(H¯HH¯+σ2INt)−1H¯HAssuming the input-output relationship of the MIMO–CDMA system as(32)r¯=H¯d¯+n¯The algorithm can be described as followsInitialize:(33)i=1(34)W¯i=(H¯iHH¯i+σ2INt)−1H¯iHRecursion(35)zi=argmin∥(W¯i)∥(36)Yzi=(W¯i)zir¯i(37)d¯^zi=Q(Yzi)(38)r¯i+1=r¯i−d¯^zi(H)zi(39)W¯i+1=(H¯ziHH¯zi+σ2INt)−1HziH(40)i=i+1where(·)+represents the Moore–Penrose pseudo inverse,(·)zidenotes the sub-matrix formed by choosing a row matrixzi,( · )Hindicates the Hermitian transpose,(·)−1indicates the inverse and finallyQ(.) represents the quantization operation, which takes the argument to the nearest constellation.The detected user information is de-spread, de-interleaved and decoded using Log-MAP decoding algorithm [18]. The same procedure is repeated to detect all the user's information.
