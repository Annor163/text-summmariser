@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The analysis of internal connective operators of fuzzy reasoning is very significant and the robustness of fuzzy reasoning has been calling for study. An interesting and important question is that, how to choose suitable internal connective operators to guarantee good robustness of rule-based fuzzy reasoning? This paper is intended to answer it. In this paper, Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic of t-norms and implications are discussed. The robustness of rule-based fuzzy reasoning is investigated and the relationships among input perturbation, rule perturbation and output perturbation are presented. The suitable t-norm and implication can be chosen to satisfy the need of robustness of fuzzy reasoning. In 1-Lipschitz operators, if both t-norm and implication are copulas, the rule-based fuzzy reasoning is much more stable and more reliable. In copulas, if both t-norm and implication are 1-l∞-Lipschitz, they can guarantee good robustness of fuzzy reasoning. The experiments not only illustrate the ideas proposed in the paper but also can be regarded as applications of soft computing. The approach in the paper also provides guidance for choosing suitable fuzzy connective operators and decision making application in rule-based fuzzy reasoning.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fuzzy reasoning and applications have been actively pursuing since Zadeh's pioneering work [33–36]. The most fundamental inference forms of fuzzy reasoning are fuzzy modus ponens and fuzzy modus tollens based on rule. Up to now, numerous algorithms of rule-based fuzzy reasoning have been introduced in many literatures [8,15,18,20,28,37,38]. Among these methods, the choice of internal connective operators greatly affects the results of ruled-based fuzzy reasoning. The analysis of internal connective operators is a very active area of fuzzy reasoning and the robustness of fuzzy reasoning has been researching in many monographs. The main internal connective operators of rule-based fuzzy reasoning are triangular norm (briefly t-norm) and implication. The properties and the applications of t-norms and implications have been investigating in many literatures, for example, see [1,5,6,27,10–14,18,20–22,24–27,29–31].In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, using different t-norms and implications can devote to drastic changes on the output values because of input perturbations and rule perturbations. These inspire us to think, what class of t-norms and implications can be used in rule-based fuzzy reasoning? Since choosing different t-norms and implications leads to different outputs, how to choose suitable t-norms and implications for rule-based fuzzy reasoning? What kind of internal connective operators can guarantee good robustness of fuzzy reasoning?k-Lipschitz t-norms are very significant for fuzzy reasoning. The Lipschitz condition is to reveal the changes between the function value and the independent variables. It is stronger than continuity but weak than derivability and can guarantee iterative processes or equivalently, which make it reasonable to model dynamic process. On the other hand, the Lipschitz property of aggregation functions guarantees their stabilities with respect to small perturbation of inputs, which is very desirable for application [1]. k-Lipschitz t-norms and k-lp-Lipschitz t-norms were well studied in monographs by Mesiarová [21,22]. In [21], some topological properties of k-Lipschitz triangular norms were investigated and the results for the case k=1 were generalized. In [22], k-lp-Lipschitz t-norms were shown to be ordinal sums of k-lp-Lipschitz Archimedean t-norms and additive generators of k-lp-Lipschitz t-norms were characterized by means of k-p-convexity known for the case k=1. Beliakov et al. [1] considered the practical construction of k-Lipschitz triangular norms and conorms from empirical data. Ricci and Mesiar [27] discussed the necessary conditions for the Lipschitz of strict t-norms. In this paper, Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic of t-norms are discussed in detail. In k-Lipschitz (k≥1) t-norms, some are 1-Lipschitz and h-lp-Lipschitz (h≥1). In 1-Lipsschitz t-norms, some are 1-l∞-Lipschitz and some are copulas. In copulas, some are 1-l∞-Lipschitz.As one of the very important internal connective operators, the studies on implications and their applications in fuzzy reasoning have been pursing. Ying [31] directly defined implications from negation, conjunction and disjunction and showed some strong implications in fuzzy logic. Yager [30] investigated the global requirement for implication operators in fuzzy modus ponens. In [29], Yager suggested two approaches for obtaining multivalued implications based on the direct use of additive generating functions, derived some new classes of implication operators and described the role of multivalued implication with the fuzzy logic based theory of approximate reasoning. Recently, Pei proposed unified implication algorithms of fuzzy reasoning in [26] and studied the formalization of implication based fuzzy reasoning method in [25]. Liu [19] introduced h−1-implications. Tang introduced symmetric implicational method of fuzzy reasoning in [28]. A new full implication algorithm based on interval-valued fuzzy inference was presented in [20]. In this paper, the implications are investigated deeply from the perspective of Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic. Some k-Lipschitz (k≥1) implications are found. In k-Lipschitz (k≥1) implications, some are 1-Lipschitz and h-lp-Lipschitz (h≥1). In 1-Lipsschitz implications, some are 1-l∞-Lipschitz and some are copulas. In copulas, some are 1-l∞-Lipschitz.Perturbation is the meaning of uncertain, imprecise and slight error. When a control system is sensitive to small deviations around input and rule, it is essential to find the maximum tolerance of the system with respect to those perturbations, referred as the system's robustness [15]. The researches on robustness of fuzzy reasoning have been shown in many literatures, for instance, see [2–4,6,7,9,15–17,32]. Cai [2] presented robustness results for various implication operators and inference rules in terms of δ-equalities of fuzzy sets. Cheng and Fu [4] estimated the upper and lower bounds of the output error affected by the perturbation parameters of input and obtained the limits of the output values when the input values ranged over some interval in many fuzzy reasoning schemes under CRI. Jin and Li et al. [9] proposed the definition of perturbation of fuzzy sets based on some logic-oriented equivalence measure and presented robustness results for various fuzzy reasoning machines by logically equivalence measure. Li et al. [15] discussed the robustness of internal-valued fuzzy connectives and investigated the sensitivity of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Dai and Pei et al. [7] extended the concept of perturbation of fuzzy sets according to normalized Minkowski distance to calculate the perturbation of fuzzy reasoning. In [6], Dai and Pei et al. studied the robustness of full implication inference method and fully implicational restriction method for fuzzy reasoning by means of fuzzy modus ponens and fuzzy modus tollens. Recently, Li and Qin et al. [16] presented robustness results for various fuzzy connectives and investigated the robustness of fuzzy reasoning from the perspective of perturbation of membership functions. The structures of four specific logic metric spaces induced by four important logic implication operators were discussed and their robustness were analyzed in [5]. In this paper, the robustness of rule-based fuzzy reasoning with internal connective operators which have Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic is studied. The relationships among input perturbation, rule perturbation and output perturbation are revealed. According to Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic, the suitable t-norms and implications can be selected to satisfy the need of robustness of fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, if both t-norm and implication are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, they can guarantee good robustness of rule-based fuzzy reasoning. All these are illustrated by the experiments and these experiments are the applications of intelligent information processing, especially face association. The approach proposed in the paper also provides guidance for choosing suitable fuzzy connective operators and decision making application in rule-based fuzzy reasoning.The correspondence is structured into several sections. In the next section, some definitions and lemmas are described. In Section 3, Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic of t-norms and implications are concentrated on. In Section 4, the robustness of fuzzy reasoning with Lipschitz aggregation operators are studied. In Section 5, the experiments with the specific application of fuzzy reasoning are given and the theoretical analysis results are verified. The conclusions are presented in Section 6.Throughout our study, the following fuzzy operations are used on the unit interval [0,1]:a∧b=min(a,b),a∨b=max(a,b),supi∈Iai=∨i∈Iai,infi∈Iai=∧i∈Iai, I is nonempty finite index set.In this section, some definitions are recall and some new definitions and lemmas are presented.Definition 2.1[11]A binary operation T on the unit interval [0,1] is a t-norm, for all x, y, z∈[0, 1], if it satisfies the following properties:1)commutative: T(x, y)=T(y, x),associative: T(T(x, y), z)=T(x, T(y, z)),monotone: T(x, z)≤T(y, z) whenever x≤y,neutral element: T(x, 1)=x.In the correspondence, we focus on the following four basic t-norms[11]:1)minimum or Gödel: TM(x, y)=TG(x, y)=min(x, y),product: TP(x, y)=xy,Lukasiewicz: TL=max(x+y−1, 0),drastic product:TD(x,y)=min(x,y),ifmax(x,y)=1,0otherwise.The dual t-norms are triangular conorms (t-conorms for short).Definition 2.2[11]A binary operation S on the unit interval [0, 1] is a t-conorm, for all x, y, z∈[0, 1], if it is commutative, associative, monotone and satisfies S(x, 0)=x for all x∈[0, 1].Definition 2.3[6,19]A mapping R: [0, 1]2→[0, 1] is a fuzzy implication if it is non-increasing on the first variable and non-decreasing on the second one and it satisfies R(0, y)=1, R(x, 1)=1 and R(1, 0)=0 for all x, y∈[0, 1].Definition 2.4[19]A fuzzy implication R is said to have1)the left neutrality property, if R(1, y)=y for all y∈[0, 1],the exchange principle, if R(x, R(y, z))=R(y, R(x, z)) for all x, y, z∈[0, 1],the identity principle, if R(x, x)=1 for all x∈[0, 1],the order property, if R(x, y)=1⇔x≤y for all x, y∈[0, 1],the consequent boundary, if R(x, y)≥y for all x, y∈[0, 1].The most important classes of implications are R-, S- and QL-implications. In the correspondence, the following implications are concentrated on, most of them can be seen in [4]:1)Lukasiewicz: RLu(x, y)=1∧(1−x+y),Kleene: RKl(x, y)=(1−x)∨y,Mamdani: RMa(x, y)=x∧y,Zadeh: RZa(x, y)=(x∧y)∨(1−x),Larsen: RLa(x, y)=xy,Reichenbach: RRe(x, y)=1−x+xy,Rk(x, y)=(1−(x∨y))∨(x∧(1−x))∨(y∧(1−y)),Rst(x, y)=(1−x)∧y,Rbp(x, y)=0∨(x+y−1),S-implications: RS(x, y)=S(1−x, y),t-norm implications: RT(x, y)=T(x, y).Definition 2.5[23]A function C: [0, 1]2→[0, 1] is copula, for all x, y∈[0, 1], if it satisfies the following properties:1)C(x, 0)=0=C(0, y),C(x, 1)=x, C(1, y)=y,For every x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1], x1≤x2 and y1≤y2, such that C(x2, y2)−C(x2, y1)−C(x1, y2)+C(x1, y1)≥0.Definition 2.6Let a function F: [0, 1]2→[0, 1] and let k>0 be a constant, then F is k-Lipschitz if |F(x2, y2)−F(x1, y1)|≤k(|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|)for all x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1]. If k=1 then F is 1-Lipschitz.Definition 2.7Let a function G: [0, 1]2→[0, 1] and let h>0 be a constant, then G is h-l∞-Lipschitz if|G(x2, y2)−G(x1, y1)|≤h(|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|)for all x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1]. If h=1 then G is 1-l∞-Lipschitz.Suppose ρ(x)∈[−1, 1], (f+ρ)(x)=f(x)+ρ(x), if f(x)+ρ(x)>1 then (f+ρ)(x)=1, if f(x)+ρ(x)<0 then (f+ρ)(x)=0.Definition 2.8Let U be a universe discourse, A′, A are two fuzzy sets on U, a mapping δ:U→[−1, 1], for all x∈U, if A′(x)=A(x)+δ(x) then δ is the perturbation of A and |δ| is the absolute perturbation of A.Definition 2.9Let U be a universe discourse, A′, A are two fuzzy sets on U, a mapping δ:U→[−1, 1], for all x∈U, A′(x)=A(x)+δ(x), H(A′, A)=∨x∈U|A′(x)−A(x)|, then H(A′, A) is the maximum perturbation between A′ and A.Lemma 2.1For all x, y, z∈[0, 1], the following properties hold:(1)|x∧y−y∧z|≤|x−z|,|x∨z−y∨z|≤|x−y|.Lemma 2.2For all xi, yi∈[0, 1],i∈I, I is nonempty finite index set, we have:(1)∣∨i∈Ixi−∨i∈Iyi∣≤∨i∈I∣xi−yi∣,∣∧i∈Ixi−∧i∈Iyi∣≤∨i∈I∣xi−yi∣,If ∣xi−yi∣≤δ, then ∣∧i∈Ixi−∧i∈Iyi∣≤δ, δ>0.Lemma 2.3Let U be a universe of discourse, A and B are two fuzzy sets defined on U, for all x∈U, then(1) |∨x∈UA(x)−∨x∈UB(x)|≤∨x∈U|A(x)−B(x)|(2)|∧x∈UA(x)−∧x∈UB(x)|≤∨x∈U|A(x)−B(x)|The proofs of Lemma 2.1–2.3 are easy, so they are omitted here.In this section, t-norms and implications on Lipschitz aggregation property and copula characteristic are study.Because of the neutral element, it is obvious that a t-norm can be k-Lipschitz only for k≥1 [22]. Because t-norms and t-conorms are dual each other, if a t-norm T is k-Lipschitz, its dual t-conorm S is also k-Lipschitz. 1-Lipschitz includes copulas, quasi-copulas, and their duals[1].Similarly, a t-norm T can be h-l∞-Lipschitz only for h≥1 and if a t-norm T is h-l∞-Lipschitz, its dual t-conorm S is also h-l∞-Lipschitz.Theorem 3.1Minimum t-norm TMis 1-Lipschitz and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, product t-norm TPand Lukasiewicz t-norm TLare 1-Lipschitz and 2-l∞-Lipschitz, TM, TPand TLare copulas.ProofObviously, TM, TPand TLare continuous and bounded. For all x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1], we have|TM(x2,y2)−TM(x1,y1)|=|min(x2,y2)−min(x1,y1)|=|(x2∧y2)−(x1∧y1)|≤|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|≤|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|.|TP(x2,y2)−TP(x1,y1)|=|x2y2−x1y1|=|x2y2−x1y2+x1y2−x1y1|≤y2|x2−x1|+x1|y2−y1|≤|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|≤2(|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|).|TL(x2,y2)−TL(x1,y1)|=|max(x2+y2−1,0)−max(x1+y1−1,0)|=|((x2+y2−1)∨0)−((x1+y1−1)∨0)|≤|x2−x1+y2−y1|≤|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|≤2(|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|).So, minimum t-norm TMis 1-Lipschitz and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, product t-norm TPand Lukasiewicz t-norm TLare 1-Lipschitz and 2-l∞-Lipschitz.On the other hand, for all x, y∈[0, 1], TP(x, 0)=0=TP(0, y), TP(x, 1)=x and TP(1, y)=y. Moreover, for all x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1] and x1≤x2, y1≤y2, we getTP(x2,y2)−TP(x2,y1)−TP(x1,y2)+TP(x1,y1)=x2y2−x2y1−x1y2+x1y1=x2(y2−y1)−x1(y2−y1)=(y2−y1)(x2−x1)≥0.Thus, TPis 2-increasing, and hence it is copula.Similarly, it is easy to prove that TMand TLare copulas.Drastic product t-norm TDis not continuous, it is not k-Lipschitz.Theorem 3.2Mamdani implication RMa, Larsen implication RLaand Rbpproposed in Section2are copulas and Mamdani implication RMais 1-l∞-Lipschitz.The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.1.Theorem 3.31) Lukasiewicz implication RLuis 1-Lipschitz but not copula;2) Kleene implication RKl, the implication Rkand Rstaddressed in Section2are 1-l∞-Lipschitz but not copula;3) Zadeh implication RZaand Reichenbach implication RReare k-Lipschitz and k>1.ProofRLu, RKl, Rk, Rst, RZaand RReare continuous and bounded. For all x1, x2, y1, y2∈[0, 1],1) |RLu(x2, y2)−RLu(x1, y1)|=|1∧(1−x2+y2)−1∧(1−x1+y1)|≤|−x2+y2+x1−y1|≤|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|.But if x≠1, then RLu(x, 1)=1∧(1−x+1)=1≠x, and RLu(x, 0)=1∧(1−x+0)=1−x≠0.So, Lukasiewicz implication RLuis 1-Lipschitz but not copula.2) |RKl(x2, y2)−RKl(x1, y1)|=|(1−x2)∨y2−(1−x1)∨y1|≤|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|.On the other hand, if x≠1, then RKl(x, 1)=(1−x)∨1=1≠x, and RKl(x, 0)=(1−x)∨0=1−x≠0.Hence, Kleene implication RKlis 1-l∞-Lipschitz but not copula.|Rk(x2, y2)−Rk(x1, y1)|=|(1−(x2∨y2))∨(x2∧(1−x2))∨(y2∧(1−y2))−(1−(x1∨y1))∨(x1∧(1−x1))∨(y1∧(1−y1))|≤|(x1∨y1)−(x2∨y2)|∨|(x2∧(1−x2))−(x1∧(1−x1))|∨|(y2∧(1−y2))−(y1∧(1−y1))|≤|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|.Rk(x, 1)=(1−(x∨1))∨(x∧(1−x))∨(1∧(1−1))=x∧(1−x). When x>0.5, Rk(x, 1)≠x.Therefore, the implication Rkis 1-l∞-Lipschitz but not copula.|Rst(x2, y2)−Rst(x1, y1)|=|(1−x2)∧y2−(1−x1)∧y1|≤|x2−x1|∨|y2−y1|.If x=0, then Rst(x, 1)=(1−x)∧1=1≠x.So, the implication Rstis 1-l∞-Lipschitz but not copula.3) |RZa(x2, y2)−RZa(x1, y1)|=|(x2∧y2)∨(1−x2)−(x1∧y1)∨(1−x1)|≤|x2∧y2−x1∧y1|∨|x2−x1|≤2|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|≤2(|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|).|RRe(x2, y2)−RRe(x1, y1)|=|1−x2+x2y2−1+x1−x1y1|=|x1−x2+x2y2−x1y1|≤|x2−x1|+|x2y2−x1y1|=|x2−x1|+|x2y2−x1y2+x1y2−x1y1|≤|x2−x1|+y2|x2−x1|+x1|y2−y1|≤2|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|≤2(|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|).If an implication R is k-Lipschitz, it must be h-l∞-Lipschitz and 1≤k≤h.If a t-norm T or an implication R is copula, it must be 1-Lipschitz but may not be 1-l∞-Lipschitz. If a t-norm T or an implication R is non copula, it may be k-Lipschitz (k≥1).Lipschitcz aggregation property and copula characteristic of t-norm implications and S-implications depend on t-norms and their dual.In this section, U and V are two universe discourses, A and A′ are fuzzy sets defined in U, B and B′ are fuzzy sets defined on V.The most fundamentals of rule-based fuzzy reasoning are fuzzy modus ponens and fuzzy modus tollens. The model of fuzzy modus ponens states as follows:Premise 1: X is A′,Premise 2: If X is A then Y is B,Conclusion: Y is B′.where X and Y are linguistic variables.The conclusion B′ is derived as the following:B′(y)=supx∈U[T(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y))], for all y∈V.Where T is a t-norm, R is defined as an implication: [0, 1]2→[0, 1].Obviously, the conclusion B′ depends on input, rule and internal connective operators, t-norm and implication. In ruled-based fuzzy reasoning, even if both input A′ and fuzzy rule r are not perturbed, different t-norms and different implications still can lead to different output. Considering Lipschitz property and copula characteristic, the robustness of fuzzy reasoning with k-Lipschitz operators are investigated and the maximum output perturbation with different classes of t-norms and different classes of implications are concentrated on.Theorem 4.1In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B,δA′andδB′is the perturbation of A′ and B′ respectively, the implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, if t-norm T is k-Lipschitz, for all x∈U, y∈V, then|δB′(y)|≤k∨x∈U|δA′(x)|.ProofFor all y∈V,|δB′(y)|=|(B′+δB′)(y)−B′(y)|=|supx∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),R(A(x),B(y)))−supx∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|=|∨x∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),R(A(x),B(y)))−∨x∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|≤∨x∈U|T((A′+δA′)(x),R(A(x),B(y)))−T(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|.Because T is k-Lipschitz, so|δB′(y)|≤k∨x∈U|(A′+δA′)(x)−A′(x)|≤k∨x∈U|δA′(x)|.Corollary 4.1In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B,δA′andδB′is the perturbation of A′ and B′ respectively,H(A′+δA′,A′)is the maximum input perturbation andH(B′+δB′,B′)is the maximum output perturbation, the implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz. If t-norm T is copula, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′).Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1 show that when only input perturbation takes place and rule perturbation is guaranteed not to happen in rule-based fuzzy reasoning, if t-norm T is k-Lipschitz (k≥1), then the output perturbation is not more than k times of the maximum of the input perturbations, and if t-norm T is copula, then the maximum output perturbation is not more than the maximum input perturbation.Theorem 4.1In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B, δA, δBandδB′is the perturbation of A, B and B′ respectively, the t-norm T is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, if the implication R is k-Lipschitz (k≥1), for all x∈U, y∈V, then|δB′(y)|≤k∨x∈U(|δA(x)|+|δB(y)|).ProofFor all y∈V,|δB′(y)|=|(B′+δB′)(y)−B′(y)|=|supx∈UT(A′(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−supx∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|=|∨x∈UT(A′(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−∨x∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|≤∨x∈U|T(A′(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−T(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|.Since T is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz and R is k-Lipschitz, we have|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U|R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y))−R(A(x),B(y))|≤k∨x∈U(|(A+δA)(x)−A(x)|+|(B+δB)(y)−B(y)|)≤k∨x∈U(|δA(x)|+|δB(y)|).Corollary 4.2In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B, δA, δBandδB′is the perturbation of A, B and B′ respectively, H(A+δA, A), H(B+δB, B) andH(B′+δB′,B′)is the maximum perturbation between A+δAand A, between B+δBand B and betweenB′+δB′and B′ respectively, the t-norm T is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz,1) if implication R is copula, for all x∈U, y∈V, thenH(B′+δB′)≤H(A+δA,A)+H(B+δB,B);2) if implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, for all x∈U, y∈V, thenH(B′+δB′)≤H(A+δA,A)∨H(B+δB,B).Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.2 present that when both the antecedent perturbation and the consequence perturbation take place at the same time and the input perturbation is assured not to happen in rule-based fuzzy reasoning, if implication R is k-Lipschitz (k≥1), then the output perturbation is not more than k times of the maximum of the sums of the antecedent perturbation and the consequence perturbation, if implication R is copula, then the maximum output perturbation is not greater than the sum of the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation, and if implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then the maximum output perturbation is not more than the greater of the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation.Theorem 4.2In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B, δA,δA′, δBandδB′is the perturbation of A, A′, B and B′ respectively, if t-norm T is kT-Lipschitz (kT≥1) and implication R is kR-Lipschitz (kR≥1), for all x∈U, y∈V, then|δB′(y)|≤kT∨x∈U|δA′(x)|+kR∨x∈U(|δA(x)|+|δB(y)|).ProofFor all y∈V,|(B′+δB′)(y)−B′(y)|=|supx∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−supx∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|=|∨x∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−∨x∈UT(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|≤∨x∈U|T((A′+δA′)(x),R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y)))−T(A′(x),R(A(x),B(y)))|.Since T is kT-Lipschitz and R is kR-Lipschitz, we obtain|δB′(y)|≤kT∨x∈U(|δA′|+|R((A+δA)(x),(B+δB)(y))−R(A(x),B(y))|)≤kT∨x∈U|δA′(x)|+kR∨x∈U(|δA(x)|+|δB(y)|).Corollary 4.3In rule-based fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, the fuzzy rule r: if A then B, δA,δA′, δBandδB′is the perturbation of A, A′, B and B′ respectively, H(A+δA, A),H(A′+δA′,A′), H(B+δB, B) andH(B′+δB′,B′)is the maximum perturbation between A+δAand A, betweenA′+δA′and A′, between B+δBand B and betweenB′+δB′and B′ separately,1) if t-norm T and implication R are copulas, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′)+H(A+δA,A)+H(B+δB,B);2) if t-norm T and implication R are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′)∨H(A+δA,A)∨H(B+δB,B).Theorem 4.3 and Corollary 4.3 state that when both input perturbation and rule perturbation come simultaneously in rule-based fuzzy reasoning, if t-norm T is kT-Lipschitz (kT≥1) and implication R is kR-Lipschitz (kR≥1), then the output perturbation is not greater than the sum of kT(kT≥1) times of the maximum of input perturbation and kR(kR≥1) times of the maximum of the sums of the antecedent perturbation and the consequence perturbation; if both t-norm T and implication R are copulas, then the maximum output perturbation is not greater than the sum of the input perturbation, the antecedent perturbation and the consequence perturbation; if both t-norm T and implication R are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then the maximum output perturbation is not greater than the maximum of the maximum input perturbation, the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation.These also lie in multiple fuzzy reasoning, which are stated in the following Theorem 4.4 and Corollary 4.4.Theorem 4.3In multiple fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, fuzzy rules ri: if Aithen Bi, i=1, 2, …, n,δA′,δAi,δB′andδBiare the perturbations of A′, Ai, B′ and Birespectively, for all x∈U, y∈V, if the t-norm T is kT-Lipschitz (kT≥1) and the implication R is kR-Lipschitz (kR≥1) then|δB′(y)|≤kT∨x∈U|δA′(x)|+kR∨i=1n(|δAi(x)|+|δBi(y)|).ProofFor all y∈V,∣(B′+δB′)(y)−B′(y)∣=∣supx∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),∨i=1nR((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y)))−supx∈UT(A′(x),∨i=1nR(Ai(x),Bi(y)))∣=∣∨x∈UT((A′+δA′)(x),∨i=1nR((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y)))−∨x∈UT(A′(x),∨i=1nR(Ai(x),Bi(y)))∣≤∨x∈U∣T((A′+δA′)(x),∨i=1nR((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y)))−T(A′(x),∨i=1nR(Ai(x),Bi(y)))∣.For T is kT-Lipschitz, so|(B′+δB′)(y)−B′(y)|≤kT∨x∈U(|δA(x)|+|∨i=1nR((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y))−∨i=1nR(Ai(x),Bi(y))|).On the other hand, R is kR-Lipschitz, then|∨i=1nR((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y))−∨i=1nR(Ai(x),Bi(y))|≤∨i=1n|R((Ai+δAi)(x),(Bi+δBi)(y))−R(Ai(x),Bi(y))|≤kR∨i=1n(|δAi(x)|+|δBi(y)|).So, we have|δB′(y)|≤kT∨x∈U|δA′(x)|+kR∨i=1n(|δAi(x)|+|δBi(y)|).Corollary 4.4In multiple fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, fuzzy rules ri: if Aithen Bi, i=1, 2, …, n,δA′,δAi,δBiandδB′are the perturbations of A′, Ai, Biand B′ respectively,H(A′+δA′,A′),H(Ai+δAi,Ai),H(Bi+δBi,Bi)andH(B′+δB′,B′)is the maximum perturbation betweenA′+δA′and A′, betweenAi+δAiand Ai, betweenBi+δBiand Biand betweenB′+δB′and B′ separately,1) if the t-norm T and the implication R are copulas, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′)+∨i=1n[H(Ai+δAi,Ai)+H(Bi+δBi,Bi)]2) if t-norm T and implication R are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′)∨[∨i=1n(H(Ai+δAi,Ai)∨H(Bi+δBi,Bi))]In chain fuzzy reasoning, we only consider 1-l∞-Lipschitz operators.Theorem 4.4In chain fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, fuzzy rules ri: if Aithen Bi, i=1, 2, …, n,δA′,δAi,δB′andδBiare the perturbations of A′, Ai, B′ and Birespectively, for all x∈U, y∈V, if the t-norm T and the implication R are 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U(|δA′(x)|∨(∨i=1n(|δAi(x)|∨|δBi(y)|))).ProofFor all y∈V,if i=1 then C1=B′ andδC1=δB′, for ∀y∈V,∣(C1+δC1)(y)−C1(y)∣=∣∨x∈U(T((A′+δA′)(x),R((A1+δA1)(x),(B1+δB1)(y))))−∨x∈U(T(A′(x),R(A1(x),B1(y))))∣≤∨x∈U∣T((A′+δA′)(x),R((A1+δA1)(x),(B1+δB1)(y)))−T(A′(x),R(A1(x),B1(y)))∣.Owing to the t-norm T is 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then|(C1+δC1)(y)−C1(y)|≤∨x∈U(∣δA′(x)∣∨∣R((A1+δA1)(x),(B1+δB1)(y))−R(A1(x),B1(y))∣).For R is 1-l∞-Lipschitz, thus|R((A1+δA1)(x),(B1+δB1)(y))−R(A1(x),B1(y))|≤(∣δA1(x)∣∨∣δB1(y)∣).It is clear that|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U(∣δA′(x)∣∨(∣δA1(x)∣∨∣δB1(y)∣)).Suppose ifi=n−1,Cn−1=B′,δCn−1=δB′, then|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U(|δA′(x)|∨(∨i=1n−1(|δAi(x)|∨|δBi(y)|))).Ifi=n,Cn=B′,δCn=δB′, then∣(Cn+δCn)(y)−Cn(y)∣=∣∨x∈U(T((Cn−1+δCn−1)(x),R((An+δAn)(x),(Bn+δBn)(y))))−∨x∈U(T(Cn−1(x),R(An(x),Bn(y))))≤∨x∈U∣T((Cn−1+δCn−1)(x),R((An+δAn)(x),(Bn+δBn)(y)))−T(Cn−1(x),R(An(x),Bn(y)))∣.Since the t-norm T is 1-l∞-Lipschitz, we have|(Cn+δCn)(y)−Cn(y)|≤∨x∈U(∣δCn−1(x)∣∨∣R((An+δAn)(x),(Bn+δBn)(y))−R(An(x),Bn(y))∣.And because the implication R is 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then|R((An+δAn)(x),(Bn+δBn)(y))−R(An(x),Bn(y))|≤(∣δAn(x)∣∨∣δBn(y)∣).So,|(Cn+δCn)(y)−Cn(y)|≤∨x∈U(∣δCn−1(x)∣∨(∣δAn(x)∣∨∣δBn(y)∣)).That means|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U(∣δCn−1(x)∣∨(∣δAn(x)∣∨∣δBn(y)∣)).Hence, we obtain|δB′(y)|≤∨x∈U(|δA′(x)|∨(∨i=1n(|δAi(x)|∨|δBi(y)|))).Corollary 4.5In chain fuzzy reasoning, the input is A′, the output is B′, fuzzy rules ri: if Aithen Bi, i=1, 2, …, n,δA′,δAi,δBiandδB′are the perturbations of A′, Ai, Biand B′ respectively,H(A′+δA′,A′),H(Ai+δAi,Ai),H(Bi+δBi,Bi)andH(B′+δB′,B′)is the maximum perturbation betweenA′+δA′and A′, betweenAi+δAiand Ai, betweenBi+δBiand Biand betweenB′+δB′and B′ separately, if the t-norm T and the implication R are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, thenH(B′+δB′,B′)≤H(A′+δA′,A′)∨i=1n(H(Ai+δAi,Ai)∨H(Bi+δBi,Bi))Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.5 show that when input and rules are perturbed at the same time in chain fuzzy reasoning, if the t-norm T and the implication R are 1-l∞-Lipschitz, then the output perturbation is not greater than the maximum of the input perturbation, the antecedent perturbation and the consequence perturbation, if the t-norm T and the implication R are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz, the maximum output perturbation is not greater than the maximum of the maximum input perturbation, the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation.The conclusions of Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.5 also apply to the multiple multidimensional fuzzy reasoning.In t-norms and implications, some do not have Lipschitz aggregation property, such as t-norm TD(presented in Section 2) and implicationR0(x,y)=1,x≤y,0x>y.How do they influence the output in rule-based fuzzy reasoning?ExampleSuppose two universe discourses U and V are equal, the fuzzy rule r: if A then A, the sampling rule r′: if A′ then A, and ∀x∈U, δA=A′(x)−A(x)>0, the input is A0, the output is B0 and the actual output isB0+δB0. TMand R0 are fuzzy connective operators. Suppose A0(x)=1. Let P={y0|A(y0)=∧y∈VA(y)}, then for ∀y∈P, x∈U, we have (A+δA)(x)>A(y). Because R0(x, y) is monotone decreasing on X and A′(x)=(A+δA)(x), so, R0(A(x), ∧y∈VA(y))≥R((A+δA)(x), ∧y∈VA(y)). For ∀y∈P, x∈U,|(B0+δB0)(y)−B0(y)|=|∨x∈U(A0(x)∧R0((A+δA)(x),A(y)))−∨x∈U(A0(x)∧R0(A(x),A(y)))|=|∨x∈UR0((A+δA)(x),A(y))−∨x∈UR0(A(x),A(y))|=|0−∨x∈UR0(A(x),A(y))|=|0−∨{x=y}∪{x≠y}R0(A(x),A(y))|=|0−1|=1.These illustrate that the actual output may mean nothing.To evaluate the performance of the proposed theory, we have performed some images tests. The input image of Fig. 1and rule images of Fig. 2which are gray-scale images with 256 gray levels per pixel are considered. Each image are in [0, 1]56×46. Fig. 3shows the different perturbed input images of Fig. 1. X1–X5 of Fig. 3 are the different results of manually making different noises on input image X of Fig. 1, X6–X12 of Fig. 3 are the results of input image X of Fig. 1 with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise and speckle noise respectively. Fig. 4shows the perturbed images of Fig. 2. Fig. 4(a) displays the antecedent image is perturbed but the consequence image is not. Fig. 4(b) shows the consequence image is perturbed but the antecedent image is not. Fig. 4(c) displays both the antecedent and consequence images are perturbed.Experiment 5.1 The input images are Fig. 3, the rule images are Fig. 2, the implication is Mamdani implication RMawhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz and the t-norm T is minimum t-norm TM, Lukasiewicz t-norm TL, the product t-norm TPand drastic product TDrespectively.The output images are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 illustrates the follows if implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz and input images are perturbed but rule images are not:1)The output images with TM, TLand TPwhich are copulas respectively are stable and reliable.The output images with TMwhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz are best.The output images with TDwhich is not Lipschitz mean nothing.The maximum output perturbations with TM, TLand TPof Fig. 5 and the maximum input perturbations of Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 6. The output images with TDof Fig. 5 mean nothing, so we have not recorded their maximum output perturbations. Fig. 6 illustrates the follows if implication R is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz:1)The maximum output perturbations with TM, TLand TPrespectively are smaller than the maximum input perturbations when the rule images are not perturbed.The maximum output perturbations with TMwhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz are smallest and stablest.Experiment 5.2 The input image is Fig. 1 which is not perturbed and the rule images are Fig. 4(a)–(c) separately, the t-norm T is TMwhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz and the implication R is RMa, RLa, Rst, RLuand RRerespectively.The output images are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 illustrates the follows if t-norm T is TMwhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz and input image is not perturbed but rule images are perturbed:1)The outputs with RMaand RLawhich are copulas are more stable and more reliable than those with Rst, RLuand RRewhich are non copula implications.item[2)] the output images with RMawhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz are best.The outputs with Rstwhich is 1-l∞-Lipschitz are more stable than those with RLuand RReand the output images with RLuwhich is 1-Lipschitz are better than those with RRewhich is 2-Lipschitz. Rst, RLuand RReare non copulas. These show that for non copula operators, 1-l∞-Lipschitz operator is more stable than 1-Lipschitz operator and 1-Lipschitz operator is more stable than 2-Lipschitz operator.The maximum antecedent perturbation, the maximum consequence perturbation and the maximum output perturbation with RMa, RLa, Rst, RLuand RRerespectively are shown in Table 1. Table 1 tells us the following if t-norm T is TMwhich is copula and 1-l∞-Lipschitz:1)The maximum output perturbations with RMaand RLarespectively are not greater than the higher of the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation.The maximum output perturbations with RMaand RLawhich are copulas respectively are smaller than those with non copula implications.The maximum output perturbations with Rstare stabler than those with RLuand RRe.Experiment 5.3 The input images are Fig. 3 and the rule images are Fig. 4(c) of Fig. 4. The internal connective operators, t-norm and implication, are the following groups respectively:1)Minimum TMand Mamdani implication RMa,Product t-norm TPand Larsen implication RLa,Product t-norm TPand implication Rst,Lukasiewicz t-norm TLand Lukasiewicz implication RLu,The output images are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 illustrates the follows when input image, antecedent image and consequence image are all perturbed:1)The output images with TMand RMaand with TPand RLawhich are copulas are better than those with non copula internal connective operators and the output images with TMand RMawhich are 1-l∞-Lipschitz are best.The output images with TPand Rstare better than those with TLand RLu. Both TPand TLare copulas but not 1-l∞-Lipschitz, Rstand RLuare non copula, Rstis 1-l∞-Lipschitz and RLuis 1-Lipschitz.In this experiment, the maximum input perturbations, the maximum antecedent perturbation, the maximum consequence perturbation and the maximum output perturbations of Fig. 8 are also recorded. They are shown in Table 2and the maximum output perturbations are described in Fig. 9. Table 2 tells us the follows when input, antecedent and consequence are all perturbed:1)The maximum output perturbations which t-norm and implication are TMand RMaand TPand RLarespectively are not greater than the highest of the maximum input perturbation, the maximum antecedent perturbation and the maximum consequence perturbation.The maximum output perturbations which both t-norm and implication are copulas are lower than those which t-norm is copula but implication is non copula.The maximum output perturbations with TMand RMawhich are copulas and 1-l∞-Lipschitz are smallest and stablest.
