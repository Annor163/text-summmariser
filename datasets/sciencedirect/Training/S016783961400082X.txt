@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper considers the problem ofG1curve interpolation using a special type of discrete logarithmic spirals. A “logarithmic arc spline” is defined as a set of smoothly connected circular arcs. The arcs of a logarithmic arc spline have equal angles and the curvatures of the arcs form a geometric sequence. Given two points together with two unit tangents at the points, interpolation of logarithmic arc splines with a user specified winding angle is formulated into finding the positive solutions to a vector equation. A practical algorithm is developed for computing the solutions and construction of interpolating logarithmic arc splines. Compared to known methods for logarithmic spiral interpolation, the proposed method has the advantages of unbounded winding angles, simple offsets and NURBS representation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Spirals, which have monotone curvatures, find wide applications in the fields of fair shape modeling, highway route design or artistic pattern design, etc. (Meek and Walton, 1992; Wang et al., 2004; Xu and Mould, 2009; Meek et al., 2012). Particularly, the clothoid spiral (also known as the Euler spiral) whose curvature is a linear function of its arc length, has often been used as a primary tool for curve completion or fair shape modeling (Kimia et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2012). Another popular spiral is the logarithmic spiral whose radius of curvature is a linear function of its arc length. The study of logarithmic spirals goes back to Descartes and Jacob Bernoulli (Davis, 1993). Logarithmic spirals have many elegant properties and can be used to model fair shapes as well as natural objects (Harary and Tal, 2011).As a generalization of Euler spirals and logarithmic spirals, Miura (2006) proposed a general equation for log-aesthetic curves. By choosing different values for a particular parameter, one can define various spirals by the equation. Except for a few special cases like circles, evaluation of log-aesthetic curves depends on numerical integration or computation of special functions (Ziatdinov et al., 2012a). If boundary points and tangents are given first, parameters for an interpolating spiral are usually determined by solving nonlinear systems or by searching strategies (Coope, 1992; Miura, 2000; Yoshida and Saito, 2006; Ziatdinov et al., 2012b).Inspired by the fact that log-aesthetic curves are usually computed numerically or approximated by other types of curves such as polynomials or rational polynomials, one can construct interpolating spirals discretely or using polynomials directly (Baumgarten and Farin, 1997; Yoshida and Saito, 2009; Walton and Meek, 2013; Yoshida et al., 2013). Polynomials or rational polynomials that have approximate linear plots of log curvatures are quasi-log-aesthetic spirals. These spirals can be evaluated explicitly. However, these curves are not log-aesthetic spirals exactly and many quasi-log-aesthetic spirals have to be pieced together when a high accuracy of approximation is desired. Geometric Hermite interpolating curves with minimal energy can generate fair shapes (Yong and Cheng, 2004), but the Euler spiral and the logarithmic spiral are of special interest in shape modeling.In this paper we considerG1Hermite interpolation by logarithmic arc splines. Our proposed algorithm is motivated by the equiangular property of logarithmic spirals and the high accuracy approximation of spirals by arc splines (Meek and Walton, 1999). By assuming that a logarithmic spiral is approximated by a sequence of smoothly connected circular arcs of equal angles and the curvatures or radii of curvatures of all arcs form a geometric sequence, we obtain a logarithmic arc spline.G1Hermite interpolation by logarithmic arc splines can be formulated as solving the free parameters from a simple equation. All solutions to the equation can be obtained using an efficient numerical method. As opposed to previous approaches which assumed bounded winding angles and unique interpolating curves, we have no such restrictions and all interpolating curves to the given boundary data can be obtained efficiently. As offsets of circular arcs are circular arcs, the offsets of logarithmic arc splines are easy to compute. Logarithmic arc splines and their offsets can be represented by NURBS or transformed into curvature continuous curves conveniently (Yang, 2004). Therefore, the proposed curve can be used as an efficient tool for shape modeling and CNC machining.The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews important properties of logarithmic spirals and proposes a definition of a logarithmic arc spline. Section 3 describes basic formulations ofG1curve interpolation by logarithmic arc splines. Theoretical analysis on the existence and algorithm steps for logarithmic arc spline interpolation are also presented. Several interesting examples are provided in Section 4, and they demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm. Section 5 concludes the paper.A logarithmic spiral of which the pole lies at the origin can be represented by polar coordinates as(1)r(t)=r0eλt,r0∈R+,λ∈Ror, by Cartesian coordinates as(2)S(t)=(x(t)y(t))=r0eλt(cos⁡(t)sin⁡(t)).Particularly,S(t)will approach the pole when λt approaches −∞.A logarithmic spiral arc can be defined by either of the above equations when the parameter t belongs to an interval[t1,t2]. The winding angle of the logarithmic spiral arc is obtained asϕ=t2−t1whenλ>0orϕ=t1−t2whenλ<0. If the winding angle satisfies|ϕ|≤2π, the spiral arc is also referred as a single-winding logarithmic spiral; otherwise, it is a multi-winding logarithmic spiral.Logarithmic spiral has several distinguished properties which make it a powerful tool for shape modeling. The clear or easily proved properties are listed with no proof.Property 2.1The angle between any radial line and the tangent line that passes through the same point does not change when the point moves along the logarithmic spiral.This property is also known as the equiangular property, which was first observed by Rene Descartes. In particular, the angle φ between the radial line and the tangent line is computed byλ=cot⁡φ, where λ is the parameter as in Eq. (1).Property 2.2LetS(t)be a logarithmic spiral,k∈Z+, the tangents at pointsS(t)orS(t+2kπ)are parallel and the angle between the tangent direction and the chordS(t+2kπ)−S(t)is acute.Property 2.3LetPaandPbbe the endpoints of a logarithmic spiral arc, the curvature decreasing fromPatoPband the winding angle being less than 2π. Assume α and β are the unsigned angles betweenPb−Paand the tangent to the arc atPaor betweenPb−Paand the tangent to the arc atPb, respectively. It follows thatα>β.ProofWithout loss of generality we assume the logarithmic spiral is represented by Eq. (2) withλ>0, and the endpoints of a logarithmic spiral arc arePa=S(t)andPb=S(t+τ). If the winding angle τ is less than π, the logarithmic spiral arc is convex and short and the property holds based on Vogt's theorem (Theorem 3.17 in Guggenheimer, 1977).We proveα>βforπ≤τ<2π. Since0<α,β<π, we should only provecos⁡α<cos⁡β. From Eq. (2), we havecos⁡α=S(t+τ)−S(t)‖S(t+τ)−S(t)‖⋅S′(t)‖S′(t)‖=eλτ(λcos⁡τ+sin⁡τ)−λ1+e2λτ−2eλτcos⁡τ1+λ2andcos⁡β=S(t+τ)−S(t)‖S(t+τ)−S(t)‖⋅S′(t+τ)‖S′(t+τ)‖=λeλτ−λcos⁡τ+sin⁡τ1+e2λτ−2eλτcos⁡τ1+λ2.Omitting the common denominator withincos⁡αandcos⁡β, the sign ofcos⁡β−cos⁡αis judged byh(t)=λeλτ−λcos⁡τ+sin⁡τ−[eλτ(λcos⁡τ+sin⁡τ)−λ]=λ(1+eλτ)(1−cos⁡τ)+sin⁡τ(1−eλτ)=2sin⁡τ2[λ(1+eλτ)sin⁡τ2+(1−eλτ)cos⁡τ2].Asλ>0andπ2≤τ2<π, it is derived thath(t)>0. This proves the property.  □Property 2.4If a sequence of points are sampled from a logarithmic spiral with a constant winding angle between every two neighboring samples, the curvatures at the sampled points form a geometric sequence.It is noted that the points sampled with a constant winding angle from a logarithmic spiral also form a discrete logarithmic spiral. However, this curve is onlyC0continuous. In the following, we will present a new discrete logarithmic spiral that isC1continuous. A practical algorithm for Hermite interpolation by this curve will also be given.As a discrete approximation to the logarithmic spiral, a logarithmic arc spline is consisting of a sequence of smoothly connected circular arcs of which the center angles are the same and the curvatures form a geometric sequence. In particular, if all arcs are quater-circles and the growth rate of arc radii equals to the golden ratio, the logarithmic arc spline is a discrete approximation to the golden spiral.11http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral.The clothoid arc spline was given in Meek and Walton (2004) and relaxed for interpolation of Hermite data in Zhou et al. (2012).Assume thatPi,i=0,1,…,nare the end points or the joint points between consequent circular arcs of a logarithmic arc spline; see Fig. 1. The unit tangent at pointPiisTiand the signed center angle of each arc is denoted as θ. If the rotation is counterclockwise the angle θ is positive; otherwise, it is negative. Letli=‖Pi+1−Pi‖andLi=(Pi+1−Pi)/lifori=0,1,…,n−1. It follows that the angle betweenTiandLiisθ/2and the angle fromLitoLi+1is θ. LetMθ:=M(θ)=(cos⁡θ−sin⁡θsin⁡θcos⁡θ)be a rotation matrix, we haveL0=Mθ2T0andLi+1=MθLifori=0,1,…,n−1.Assume that the (signed) radius of the circular arc which interpolates pointsPi,Pi+1and tangentTiisri, we haveli=2risin⁡(θ/2)fori=0,1,…,n−1. Under the assumption that the curvatures, or equivalently, the radii of circular arcs form a geometric sequence, we haver1=ρr0,r2=ρr1=ρ2r0, … ,rn−1=ρn−1r0, where ρ is a positive constant. It is further derived thatl1=ρl0,l2=ρ2l0, … ,ln−1=ρn−1l0. By accumulating the vectors between neighboring points, an arbitrary joint pointPi,0<i≤ncan be computed by(3)Pi=P0+l0L0+l1L1+…+li−1Li−1=P0+(l0I+ρl0Mθ+…+ρi−1l0Mθi−1)L0=P0+l0(I−ρMθ)−1(I−ρiMθi)L0,where I is the2×2identity matrix. If the start arc and the radii ratio are known, all joint points of a logarithmic arc spline will be computed by Eq. (3).The unit tangent vector at pointPican be computed byTi=MθiT0=MiθT0. In particular,Tn=MnθT0. LetVi=Mπ/2Ti, the centers of all circular arcs are obtained asOi=Pi+riVi,i=0,1,…,n−1.It is proved in Meek and Walton (1999) that a spiral segment can be approximated by a spiral arc spline with a high accuracy when the arc number is a large number. We check the convergence of approximating logarithmic arc splines numerically. An original logarithmic spiral is defined byr(t)=0.1e0.12t,0≤t≤6π. We approximate the spiral by constructing logarithmic arc splines that interpolate the boundary data of the original spiral. Details of logarithmic arc spline interpolation will be given in next section. Fig. 2illustrates the initial spiral and an interpolating logarithmic arc spline that consists of 10 or 40 arcs. Approximation errors using various numbers of circular arcs are given in Table 1. From the table we can see that the approximation of a logarithmic spiral by an interpolating logarithmic arc spline appears to converge quadratically. However, a theoretical analysis is still not available at present.AssumePaandPbare two distinct points on a plane,TaandTbare the two corresponding unit tangents that satisfy the following two requirements. (1) NeitherTanorTbis parallel or antiparallel toPL=Pb−Pa. (2) The angle betweenTaandPLis acute when the vectorsTaandTbare the same. We compute the winding angles of all potential logarithmic spirals that match the boundary data first and then construct a logarithmic arc spline that has a specified winding angle ϕ and interpolates the given points and the given tangents at the points.The logarithmic spirals interpolating pointsPa,Pband tangentsTa,Tbcan be multi-winding spirals of which the magnitudes of winding angles are larger than 2π or just a single-winding spiral of which the absolute winding angle is no more than 2π. We refer the winding angle corresponding to the single-winding interpolating spiral as the minimum winding angle. The winding angles corresponding to multi-winding interpolating spirals can then be obtained by adding/subtracting2kπ, wherek∈Z+, from the minimum winding angle.The computation of the minimum winding angleϕmindepends on whether the tangentsTaandTblie on one or two sides of the line throughPaandPb. LetU=PL/‖PL‖, the unsigned angles betweenTaand U or betweenTband U can be computed byα=cos−1⁡(Ta⋅U)andβ=cos−1⁡(Tb⋅U), respectively. If vectorsTaandTblie on two sides of chordPaPb, the interpolating single-winding logarithmic spiral lies on one side of the chord and the minimum winding angle satisfies|ϕmin|=α+β. Moreover, the winding direction of the tangent along the spiral fromPatoPbcoincides with the direction fromTato U (with angle less than π). In this case, the (signed) minimum winding angleϕminis computed byϕmin={+(α+β),ifTa∧U>0−(α+β),otherwisewhereTa∧Urepresents the scalar cross product of two planar vectors. Fig. 3(a) illustrates several single-winding logarithmic spirals lying on one side of the given chord.If the two given tangents lie on one side of the chord, the interpolating single-winding logarithmic spiral will wind around one end vertex and cross the line throughPaandPb. Based on Property 2.3, the interpolating logarithmic spiral will wind aroundPawhenα>βor wind aroundPbwhenα<β. Particularly, the winding direction of the tangent along the spiral fromPatoPbcoincides with the direction from U toTawhen the interpolating spiral winds aroundPa. Similarly, the winding direction of the tangent coincides with the direction fromTato U when the spiral winds aroundPb. Combining these two cases together we haveϕmin={2π−|α−β|,if(α−β)(U∧Ta)>0|α−β|−2π,if(α−β)(U∧Ta)<0Fig. 3(b) illustrates several single-winding logarithmic spirals that wind around one of the two end vertices of the chord.IfTa=Tbandα=β<π2, an interpolating logarithmic spiral can wind around either of the two vertices. If we chooseϕmin=2π, the interpolating spiral winds around vertexPawhenU∧Ta>0or winds around vertexPbwhenU∧Ta<0. If we chooseϕmin=−2πthe interpolating spiral will wind around vertexPborPa, respectively in the mentioned two cases.Letϕaandϕbbe the winding angles of the tangent direction along the interpolating single-winding spiral fromTato U or from U toTb, respectively. These two angles have the same sign withϕminand satisfyϕmin=ϕa+ϕb. Particularly, the angles also satisfy|ϕa|=αand|ϕb|=βwhenTaandTblie on two sides of the chordPaPb. IfTaandTblie on the same side of the chord, the angles satisfy|ϕa|=2π−αand|ϕb|=βwhenα>βor|ϕa|=αand|ϕb|=2π−βotherwise. We note thatϕaandϕbare not essential for the construction of interpolating curves, but they will be used for the analysis of solutions to the interpolation problem.When the minimum winding angle has been obtained, the winding angles for multi-winding interpolating logarithmic spirals can be defined by(4)ϕ={ϕmin+2kπ,ifϕmin>0ϕmin−2kπ,otherwisewhere k is an arbitrary positive integer.For given boundary data and a specified winding angle ϕ which satisfies Eq. (4), we construct an interpolating logarithmic arc spline consisting of n segments of circular arcs. From the definition of logarithmic arc spline the center angle of each circular arc can be chosen asθ=ϕn. The unit vector corresponding to the chord of the first circular arc is obtained asMθ/2Ta, whereMθ/2is the rotation matrix as defined in Section 2. When a logarithmic arc spline interpolates pointsPaandPbat two ends, it implies thatP0=PaandPn=PbwithPi,i=1,2,…,n−1as the intermediate joint points of the arc spline. From Eq. (3) we have(5)Pb−Pa=l0(I−ρMθ)−1(I−ρnMϕ)L0,wherel0is the chord length of the first arc and ρ is the ratio between consequent arc radii. This equation can be reformulated as(6)l0(I−ρnMϕ)L0+ρMθPL=PL.To solve the unknowns ρ andl0, we derive two scalar equations from Eq. (6). Crossing both sides of Eq. (6) with(I−ρnMϕ)L0, we have(7)f(ρ)=aρn+1+bρn+cρ+d=0,wherea=(MϕL0)∧(MθPL),b=−(MϕL0)∧PL,c=−L0∧(MθPL)andd=L0∧PL. Crossing both sides of Eq. (6) withMθPL, we have another scalar equation(8)l0(I−ρnMϕ)L0∧(MθPL)=PL∧(MθPL).Provided ρ has already been obtained,l0can be solved out from Eq. (8) immediately. It yields(9)l0=PL∧(MθPL)(I−ρnMϕ)L0∧(MθPL).If there exist positive solutions to Eq. (7) and the correspondingl0are also positive, we can then construct logarithmic arc splines interpolating the given boundary data by the method stated in Section 2.2.AsMϕ=MϕminandA∧B=‖A‖‖B‖sin⁡φ, where φ is the signed angle from A to B, the coefficients within Eq. (7) can be reformulated asa=lesin⁡(ϕb−θ/2);b=−lesin⁡(ϕb+θ/2);c=lesin⁡(ϕa+θ/2);d=−lesin⁡(ϕa−θ/2),wherele=‖PL‖. Before proving the existence of interpolating logarithmic arc splines we prove the existence of positive roots to Eq. (7).Theorem 3.1Assume thatTaandTbare the specified unit tangents at two ends of chordPaPb. The angles α, β and ϕ are computed or specified as in Section3.1. If we choose the total number of arcs satisfyingn>|ϕ|2min⁡{α,π−α,β,π−β}and computeθ=ϕn, the following results hold.1.IfTaandTblie on two sides of chordPaPb, there exist one or three positive roots to Eq.(7).IfTaandTblie on the same side of chordPaPb, there exist two positive roots to Eq.(7).ProofFrom the computation of α and β we know that0<α,β<π. By choosingn>|ϕ|2min⁡{α,π−α,β,π−β}and computingθ=ϕnwe know that|θ2|<min⁡{α,π−α,β,π−β}≤π2. Thus,sin⁡θhas the same sign as θ. Based on the relationship between α, β andϕa,ϕbwe conclude that the signs ofsin⁡(ϕa±θ/2)orsin⁡(ϕb±θ/2)are the same as that ofsin⁡(ϕa)orsin⁡(ϕb), respectively.We next consider the solutions to Eq. (7) under the case thatTaandTblie on two sides of chordPaPb. In this case the winding anglesϕaandϕbsatisfymax⁡{|ϕa|,|ϕb|}<π. Therefore, the coefficients a and d of Eq. (7) have different signs. Sincef(0)=dandlimρ→+∞⁡f(ρ)=limρ→+∞⁡aρn, the equationf(ρ)=0has at least one root in(0,+∞). From the expressions of the coefficients of Eq. (7) we know that the signs of a, b, c and d change three times. Based on Descartes' rule of signs we know that Eq. (7) can have one or three positive roots.Lastly, we prove the theorem for the case thatTaandTblie on the same side of chordPaPb. From Section 3.1, we know that|ϕa|<π<|ϕb|<2πor|ϕb|<π<|ϕa|<2π. In this case the coefficients a, b, c and d satisfyad>0,bc>0butab<0andac<0. Therefore, Eq. (7) has no more than two positive roots according to Descartes' rule of signs. Without loss of generality, we assumea>0and thenf(0)andlimρ→+∞⁡f(ρ)are positive, too. Rewrite Eq. (7) asf(ρ)=a(ρn+ca)(ρ+ba)+1a(ad−bc).If|ϕmin|<2π, we havef(−can)=1a(ad−bc)=le2asin⁡(ϕmin)sin⁡θ<0. In this case Eq. (7) has exactly two positive roots. If|ϕmin|=2π, it is verified thatca=−1and Eq. (7) reduces tof(ρ)=a(ρn−1)(ρ+ba). So, the positive roots to the equation areρ1=1andρ2=−ba.  □Besides the positive ρ we should also check whether the correspondingl0is positive or not to construct an interpolating logarithmic arc spline from the given boundary data. By using the same technique as formulating a, b, c and d, Eq. (9) can be reformulated as(10)l0=lesin⁡θsin⁡(ϕa+θ/2)+ρnsin⁡(ϕb−θ/2).Assin⁡θ,sin⁡(ϕa+θ/2)andsin⁡(ϕb−θ/2)have the same sign whenTaandTblie on two sides of the chordPaPb, from Eq. (10) we havel0>0whenρ>0. Then the logarithmic arc spline computed by each positive root tof(ρ)=0and the correspondingl0interpolates the given boundary data.From the proof of Theorem 3.1 we know that the two positive roots to Eq. (7) satisfyρ1<ρ¯=−c/an<ρ2whenTa≠Tblie on one side of the chordPaPb. Asρ¯≅1when n is a large number the two roots always satisfyρ1<1andρ2>1. From Eq. (10) we havel0≈lesin⁡θsin⁡(ϕa+θ/2)ifρ1n≪1andl0≈lesin⁡θρ2nsin⁡(ϕb−θ/2)whenρ2n≫1. By choosingρ=ρ1whenα<βor choosingρ=ρ2whenα>βwe all havel0>0. The chosen parameter ρ and the computed chord lengthl0can then be used for the construction of an interpolating logarithmic arc spline. If the two given tangentsTaandTbare equal, the positive root to Eq. (7) is chosen asρ=−ba. Substitute it into Eq. (10) one can getl0>0, which will be used for the construction of an interpolating logarithmic arc spline.In this subsection we first discuss how to obtain all positive roots to Eq. (7) and then we present the algorithm summary of geometric Hermite interpolation by logarithmic arc splines.Except for the special solutionρ=−bafor the case that the given tangentsTa=Tband the angle betweenTaandPLis acute, the solutions to Eq. (7) should be solved numerically. The solutions to equationf(ρ)=0can be obtained by Newton's method whenTa≠Tb. Starting from an initial valueρ0, the approximate solutions can be updated as followsρi+1=ρi−f(ρi)f′(ρi).The iteration process continues until|ρi+1−ρi|<ε, where ε is a tolerance given by users. In our experiments, we chooseε=1×10−10. In case the iteration process does not converge after a certain number (such as 100) of iterations, the initialρ0should be chosen other values.To estimate a proper initial value for solving Eq. (7) by Newton's algorithm we reformulate the equation asρ=−bρn+daρn+c.If a solution to Eq. (7) is much less than 1, it can then be estimated asρ=−bρn+daρn+c≈−dc. Similarly, a solution much greater than 1 can be estimated asρ=−bρn+daρn+c≈−ba. If the given tangentsTaandTblie on two sides of the chordPaPb, or equivalentlyac>0, Eq. (7) can have three solutions. The initial values for the solutions are then chosen asρ0=1,ρ0=−dcorρ0=−ba, respectively. Note that the three initial values may lead to the same final solution because Eq. (7) can have just one positive solution.From Theorem 3.1 we know that there exist two positive roots to Eq. (7) when the coefficients satisfyac<0. Particularly, the two solutions lie in intervals(0,ρ¯)and(ρ¯,+∞), respectively. So, the initial value for the solution should lie in the corresponding interval too. To find a solution in interval(0,ρ¯), the initial value can be chosen asρ0={−dc,if−dc<ρ¯ρ¯−0.01,otherwiseSimilarly, the initial value for finding a solution in interval(ρ¯,+∞)can be chosen asρ0={−ba,if−ba>ρ¯ρ¯+0.01,otherwiseTo sum up, we outline the algorithm steps for logarithmic arc spline interpolation (see Algorithm 1).Fig. 4illustrates an example of logarithmic arc spline interpolation that has one or three solutions. Two unit tangents at two end points lie on two sides of the chord and the angles between the tangents withPb−Paareα=0.45πandβ=0.46π, respectively. By choosingϕ=α+βandn=10we obtain a single-winding logarithmic arc spline consisting of 10 arcs; see Fig. 4(a) for the interpolating curve. If we chooseϕ=α+β+8πandn=50we have three positive solutions to Eq. (7). Based on each solution and the correspondingl0an interpolating logarithmic arc spline consisting of 50 arcs is obtained; see Figs. 4(b)–(d) for the three interpolating curves.Fig. 5illustrates an example of logarithmic arc spline interpolation when the specified tangents lie on one side of the chord. The tangents at two ends of the chordPaPbare specified such that the angles betweenPb−Paand the two tangents areα=π2andβ=2π3, respectively; see Fig. 5(a). By choosingϕ=ϕmin=−116πandn=10the two positive solutions to the equationf(ρ)=0are obtained asρ1=0.886635andρ2=1.429398. By choosingρ=ρ1we obtain a logarithmic arc spline interpolating the given boundary data. If we chooseρ=ρ2, the obtainedl0is negative and a logarithmic arc spline interpolating the opposite directions of the specified end tangents is obtained. When we chooseϕ=ϕmin−4πandn=20we obtain a multi-winding logarithmic arc spline interpolating the Hermite data; see Fig. 5(b).An example for logarithmic arc spline interpolation to Hermite data withTa=Tbis given in Fig. 2. A discrete logarithmic spiral consisting 10 or 40 circular arcs spline has been used to interpolate the boundary data of logarithmic spiral arc with winding angle 6π.In Kurnosenko (2010) a spiral computed by inversions of logarithmic spiral has been used to interpolateG2Hermite data with a big winding angle. As this spiral is in fact a rational function composed of logarithmic spiral and Möbius map, it is not exactly the logarithmic spiral generally. Our proposed logarithmic arc spline can approximate a continuous logarithmic spiral with a high accuracy and maintains many elegant properties of logarithmic spirals. Due to its flexibility and simplicity for computation, logarithmic arc splines can be used in fields of design and modeling.In this section we present a few more examples to show the applicability of logarithmic arc spline interpolation for various shape modeling purposes.First, we present examples to model a “C”-shape curve and a blade profile by logarithmic arc spline interpolation. To model a “C”-like shape users can just input four points plus four tangents; see Fig. 6(a). From the figure we can see that the end tangents at two pairs of neighboring points lie on one side of the chord while the tangents for the rest two pairs of neighboring points lie on two sides of the corresponding chord. By choosingϕ=ϕminandn=8for each pair of Hermite data, aG1smooth curve consisting of 32 circular arcs is obtained. By the same technique we model a blade profile by logarithmic arc spline interpolation. Starting from 6 input points together with 6 unit tangents at the points (Fig. 6(b)), the minimum winding angles for the curves interpolating each pair of consequent points and tangents are first computed. After then, an interpolating arc spline consisting of total 18 circular arcs is obtained by interpolating 6 pairs of Hermite data.Next, we present an example of curve interpolation using single-winding as well as multi-winding logarithmic arc splines. A sequence of initial points and tangents are given in Fig. 7(a). For each pair of consequent points together with the unit tangents at the points the angles between the tangents and the chord areα=38π,β=π2orα=π2,β=38π. By choosingϕ=ϕmin=−7π8andn=5for constructing each logarithmic arc spline, a smooth curve consisting of total 80 circular arcs is obtained; see Fig. 7(b) for the interpolating curve. When we choose the winding angleϕ=−7π8−2πandn=20for the construction of each interpolating logarithmic arc spline, the corresponding equationf(ρ)=0has just one positive root. As a result, a multi-winding logarithmic arc spline is obtained to interpolate each pair of Hermite data; see Fig. 7(c) for the interpolating arc splines or Fig. 7(d) for the final smooth curve.
