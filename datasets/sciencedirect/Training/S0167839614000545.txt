Minimal surface,Canonical principal parameters,

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ganchev has recently proposed a new approach to minimal surfaces. Introducing canonical principal parameters for these surfaces, he has proved that the normal curvature determines the surface up to its position in the space. Here we prove a theorem that permits to obtain equations of a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters and we make some applications on parametric polynomial minimal surfaces. Thus we show that Ganchev's approach implies an effective method to prove the coincidence of two minimal surfaces given in isothermal coordinates by different parametric equations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the differential geometry of space curves the natural parameters are an important tool. These parameters are used to define the natural equations of the space curves, the curvature and the torsion, which are objects that determine the curves up to position in the space. In particular, a plane curve is determined up to position in the plane by its curvature.In the geometry of surfaces we haven't been aware of analogous natural parameters and natural equations until now. Recently natural parameters were introduced for a wide class of surfaces, the so-called Weingarten surfaces, see Ganchev and Mihova (2010). Some results of this article were specialized in Ganchev (2008) for the class of minimal surfaces and canonical principal parameters were introduced. Like the natural parameters of the space curves they are determined up to a sign and additive constants. Moreover, the normal curvature of a minimal surface expressed in these parameters determines completely the surface up to a position in the space – just like the curvature of a plane curve.Note that a surface may appear in quite different parametrizations and it is not easy to say whether or not two equations define the same surface. For example the catenoid may be represented in nonparametric form, i.e. as a graph of a functionz=arccoshx2+y2or with any of the following parametric equations:x(u,v)=(u2(1+1u2+v2),v2(1+1u2+v2),12ln⁡(u2+v2)),x˜(u,v)=(cosh⁡ucos⁡v,cosh⁡usin⁡v,u).To prove that the surfaces defined by two equations coincide we can look for a change of the parameters and/or the coordinate system, or use a theorem from Eisenhart (1909). But any one of these methods is an arduous task in general. The results of Ganchev imply a very useful method in this direction for minimal surfaces: we may simply calculate the normal curvature of these surfaces in canonical principal parameters and then compare the results. The problem is that usually a minimal surface is defined in arbitrary isothermal parameters.Here we find a differential equation that gives us a possibility to make the transition from isothermal parameters of a minimal surface to canonical principal parameters. Then we make some applications of this result. We find the group of transformations on a holomorphic function that preserves the minimal surface generated by this function, so we join any minimal surface with a class of holomorphic functions.Our results will be useful in the CAD research. Indeed one of the main tasks in the computer aided geometric design is to find a surface with prescribed border that minimizes the area among all the surfaces with the same border. A classical result says that such a surface is minimal. Because of the high nonlinearity of the area functional and the development of the theory of Bézier surfaces it is more convenient to consider a restricted problem: among all parametric polynomial surfaces with prescribed border find a surface with a minimal area, see e.g. Monterde (2004). A similar problem for biharmonic Bézier surfaces is considered in Monterde and Ugail (2004). Some of the results of Monterde (2004) and Monterde and Ugail (2004) are generalized in Wu and Wang (2012). In Xu et al. (2009) is proposed the use of a different functional for minimization (it is expressed by the mean and the Gauss curvature) and an optimization method is presented for Bézier surfaces.Of course, because of the advantages of the minimal surfaces, it is best to consider a non-restricted problem and to obtain if possible a polynomial minimal surface as a result. This leads to the questions: which parametric polynomial surfaces are minimal and how they differ. A possible way to answer the second question is to use the method given by the results in Sections 3 and 4 of this paper.It is proved in Cosín and Monterde (2002) that the parametric polynomial minimal surfaces of degree 3 in isothermal parameters are too rigid to be used in CAD works as a consequence of the fact that the Enneper surface is the only such surface. On the other hand in Xu and Wang (2010) some families of parametric minimal surfaces of degree 5 are introduced and some of their beautiful properties are obtained. Applying our method, in Section 5 we obtain a surprising result: these families actually coincide and any surface in them is homothetic to the surface generated via the Weierstrass formula withf(z)=z2,g(z)=z. A similar result follows for some polynomial surfaces of degree 6, introduced in Xu and Wang (2008). So the structure of these families is now clear.Let S be a regular surface defined by the parametric equationx=x(u,v)=(x1(u,v),x2(u,v),x3(u,v)),(u,v)∈U⊂R2.Denote the derivatives of the vector functionx=x(u,v)byxu=∂x∂u,xv=∂x∂v.The coefficients of the first fundamental form are given byE=xu2,F=xuxv,G=xv2,and the unit normal to the surface isU=xu×xv|xu×xv|.The second derivatives ofx(u,v)are denoted byxuu,xuv,xvv, respectively. Then the coefficients of the second fundamental form are given byL=Uxuu,M=Uxuv,N=Uxvv.Suppose that the principal lines of S are parametric lines and the surface has no umbilic points. ThenF=M=0and the principal curvaturesν1andν2are expressed byν1=LE,ν2=NG.The Gauss curvature K and the mean curvature H of a surface S are defined byK=LN−M2EG−F2=ν1ν2,H=EN−2FM+GL2(EG−F2)=ν1+ν22.Note that the Gauss curvature of a surface does not depend on the parametrization while the mean curvature is an invariant up to a sign. The surface S is said to be minimal if its mean curvature vanishes identically. In this case the Gauss curvature is negative and the principal curvatures are related byν1+ν2=0. Then the normal curvature ν of S is defined to be the functionν=−K, i.e. the normal curvature is the positive principal curvature, see Ganchev (2008).In the different aspects of the study of a surface one can consider special parameters closely related to the problem. We recall two of these kinds of special parameters that we will use:– the parameters are called isothermal, ifE=G,F=0;– the parameters are called principal, if the parametric lines are principal lines.It is always possible to change the parameters(u,v)so that the resulting parametrization be isothermal or principal.Let us now consider a minimal surface defined in isothermal parameters. Then very often it is convenient to use complex functions to investigate this surface. We recall briefly this procedure.Letf(z)andg(z)be two holomorphic functions (actually sometimes they are taken meromorphic). Define the Weierstrass complex curveΨ(z)byΨ(z)=∫z0z(12f(z)(1−g2(z)),i2f(z)(1+g2(z)),f(z)g(z))dz.ThenΨ(z)is a minimal curve, i.e.Ψ′2(z)=0, and its real and imaginary partsx(u,v)andy(u,v)define two conjugate minimal surfaces in isothermal parametrizations.For example the classical Enneper surfacex(u,v)=(12u−u36+12uv2,−12v+v36−12u2v,12(u2−v2))is generated by the Weierstrass formula with the functionsf(z)=1,g(z)=z.Conversely every minimal surface can be obtained at least locally in this way. Note however that a minimal surface can be generated via the Weierstrass formula by different pairs of complex functionsf(z),g(z).It is easy to see that the coefficients E and G of the first fundamental form of the surface defined via the Weierstrass formula with functionsf(z),g(z)are given by(2.1)E=G=14|f|2(1+|g|2)2.Analogously the normal curvature is(2.2)ν=4|g′||f|(1+|g|2)2,see Gray et al. (2006, Theorem 22.33).The use of the Weierstrass formula is the most common way to obtain minimal surfaces, although there are other classical methods. For example in Eisenhart (1909) we can see the Enneper's formula, which refers a minimal surface to its minimal lines. The Björling formula that permits to find a minimal surface containing a given unit speed plane curve as a geodesic is explained in Gray et al. (2006).Recently a new approach to minimal surfaces was proposed in Ganchev (2008). Briefly speaking Ganchev introduces special principal parameters, called the canonical principal parameters. If the surface is parametrized with them then the coefficients of the fundamental forms areE=G=1ν,F=0,L=1,M=0,N=−1.The idea leads to the Weierstrass formula withf(z)=−1/g′(z), i.e. to the special Weierstrass curveΦ(z)=−∫z0z(1−g2(z)2g′(z),i(1+g2(z))2g′(z),g(z)g′(z))dzand the real part of this minimal curve is a minimal surface with canonical principal parametrization. We shall use also the following theorem:Theorem A(SeeGanchev, 2008.) If a surface is parametrized with canonical principal parameters, then its normal curvature satisfies the equationΔln⁡ν+2ν=0.Conversely for any solutionν(u,v)of this equation there exists aunique(up to position in the space) minimal surface with normal curvatureν(u,v),(u,v)being canonical principal parameters.The canonical principal parameters(u,v)are determined uniquely up to the following transformations (see Ganchev, 2008)(2.3)u=εu¯+a,v=εv¯+b,ε=±1,a=const.,b=const.Suppose the surface S is defined as the real part of the Weierstrass minimal curve(3.1)Ψ(z)=∫z0z(12f(z)(1−g2(z)),i2f(z)(1+g2(z)),f(z)g(z))dz.We look for a transformationz=z(w)so that the resulting minimal curveΦ(w)has the formΦ(w)=−∫w0w(1−g˜2(w)2g˜′(w),i(1+g˜2(w))2g˜′(w),g˜(w)g˜′(w))dwfor a holomorphic functiong˜(w). The real part of this minimal curve will be a canonical principal representation of the given surface S. The equalityΨ(z(w))=Φ(w)givesΨ′(z(w))z′(w)=Φ′(w). Hence it is easy to derive(3.2)f(z(w))z′(w)=−1g˜′(w),g(z(w))=g˜(w).The last equation impliesg˜′(w)=g′(z(w))z′(w)and now from the first equation of (3.2) we obtainf(z(w))z′(w)=−1g′(z(w))z′(w).Hence(3.3)(z′(w))2=−1f(z(w))g′(z(w)).Now we know also the functiong˜(w)=g(z(w)).So we have the followingTheorem 3.1Let the minimal surface S be defined by the real part of(3.1). Any solution of the differential equation(3.3)defines a transformation of the isothermal parameters of S to canonical principal parameters. Moreover, the functiong˜(w)that defines S via the Ganchev formula is given byg˜(w)=g(z(w)).Corollary 3.1(SeeGanchev, 2008.) The canonical principal parameters of a minimal surface are determined up to the transformations(2.3).Remark 3.1Eq. (3.3) can be rewritten in the formΨ″(z(w))UΨ(z(w))(z′(w))2=1.ExampleConsider the surface S defined byx(u,v)=(14(2u−e2ucos⁡2v),14(−2v−e2usin⁡2v),eucos⁡v).A direct check shows that the parameters are isothermal and that S is minimal. To find the corresponding Weierstrass minimal curve we first look for the functionsf(z),g(z). They can be found from the well known relationsf=φ1−iφ2,g=φ3φ1−iφ2,where(φ1,φ2,φ3)=Ψ′=xu−ixv,see e.g. Gray et al. (2006, Lemma 22.31). These equalities implyf(z)=1,g(z)=ez.Now we shall find an equation of the surface in canonical principal parameters. Eq. (3.3) in this case has a solutionz(w)=2ln⁡wi2.This leads to the following form of the surface in canonical principal parametersx˜(u,v)=(32ln⁡(u2+v2)−u4+6u2v2−v464,uv(v2−u2)16−arctan⁡vu,v2−u24).Consequently the surfaces defined byx(u,v)andx˜(u,v)coincide, more preciselyx˜(u,v)is a canonical principal parametrization of the surface defined byx(u,v).As an application of Theorem 3.1, consider the minimal surface S generated by the functions(3.4)f(z)=a,g(z)=bz+c,a,b,c∈C,a,b≠0,via the Weierstrass formula. Eq. (3.3) has the form(z′(w))2=−1aband its solution isz(w)=±iwab+const.According to Corollary 3.1 and Theorem 3.1 we may replace z ing(z)withizab−cband we will obtain a parametrization of the surface S in canonical principal parameters via the Ganchev formula and the functiong˜(z)=g(izab−cb)=ibaz.We find directly its normal curvature:ν=4|ba|(1+|ba|(u2+v2))2.Remark that the obtained result shows that the surfaceS0generated via the Weierstrass formula by the functionsf(z)=|a||b|,g(z)=z,has the same normal curvature in canonical principal parameters. So because of Theorem A we may identify S withS0. On the other hand the Weierstrass formula implies thatS0is homothetic to the Enneper surface.So we haveCorollary 3.2(SeeCosín and Monterde, 2002.) The minimal surface generated by the functions(3.4)coincides with the Enneper surface up to position in the space and homothety.As a second application closely related to the polynomial minimal surfaces, consider the surface S generated via the Weierstrass formula by the functions(3.5)f(z)=azk,g(z)=bzn,a,b∈C∖{0},k,n∈N.In this case Eq. (3.3) has a solutionz(w)=2−(2/(1+k+n))(−(1+k+n)iwabn)2/(1+k+n).So we can obtain an equation of the surface in canonical principal parameters(u,v)and its normal curvature in these parameters isν=((4n)k+1(1+k+n)n−k−1|b|k+1|a|n)2/(1+k+n)(u2+v2)(1+k−n)/(1+k+n)(1+(|b|k+1|a|n(1+k+n)24n(u2+v2))2n/(1+k+n))2.Remark that this is also the normal curvature (in canonical principal parameters) of the surfaceS0generated via the Weierstrass formula by the functionsf(z)=|a||b|(k+1)/nzk,g(z)=zn.According to Theorem A the surfaces S andS0are one and the same. On the other handS0is homothetic to the surface generated by(3.6)f(z)=zk,g(z)=zn.We have provedCorollary 3.3For arbitrary nonzero complex numbers a, b the minimal surfaces generated by the pairs of functions(3.5)and(3.6)coincide up to position in the space and homothety.For different values of k and n the surfaces are different – this follows from the formulas for their normal curvatures. Figs. 3.1–3.4show parts of the surfaces obtained for some values of k and n. Of course the first of them, that in Fig. 3.1 (k=0,n=1), is the Enneper surface.As we said a minimal surface is generated by different pairs of holomorphic functions via the Weierstrass formula. For example the catenoid is generated by the pairf(z)=−e−z,g(z)=−ez,orf(z)=−1z2,g(z)=−z,orf(z)=1,g(z)=1z,and of course many others. It is natural to ask: in what condition do two pairs of holomophic functions give rise to the same minimal surface via the Weierstrass representation? It is not difficult to prove the following:Proposition 4.1Suppose the pairs(f˜(z),g˜(z))and(f(w),g(w))generate two minimal surfaces via the Weierstrass formula. Then these surfaces coincide (up to translation) iff there exists a functionw=w(z), such thatg˜(z)=g(w(z))andf˜(z)=f(w(z))w′(z).For the first two pairs above, which generate the catenoid, the functionw(z)=ln⁡z.Analogously the following question related to the Ganchev formula arises: how are related the functions that generate a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters? We have the following result in this direction:Theorem 4.1Let the holomorphic functiong(z)generate a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters, i.e. via the Ganchev formula. Then for an arbitrary complex number α and for an arbitrary real number φ any one of the functions(4.1)eiφα+g(z)1−α¯g(z)andeiφ1g(z),generates the same surface in canonical principal parameters (up to position in the space). Conversely any function that generates this (up to position in the space) surface in canonical principal parameters has the above form.ProofLet us consider the functiong˜(z)=eiφα+g(z)1−α¯g(z).Denote by S the minimal surface generated via the Ganchev formula byg(z)and byΨ(z)the corresponding minimal curve. Analogously we defineS˜andΨ˜(z).We haveΨ′(z)=−(1−g2(z)2g′(z),i(1+g2(z))2g′(z),g(z)g′(z)),Ψ˜′(z)=−(1−g˜2(z)2g˜′(z),i(1+g˜2(z))2g˜′(z),g˜(z)g˜′(z)).Letα=a+bi,a,b∈R. Consider the matricesA=(cos⁡φ−sin⁡φ0sin⁡φcos⁡φ0001),B=(1−a2+b21+a2+b2−2ab1+a2+b2−2a1+a2+b2−2ab1+a2+b21+a2−b21+a2+b2−2b1+a2+b22a1+a2+b22b1+a2+b21−a2−b21+a2+b2).A straightforward verification shows that these matrices are orthogonal of determinant 1 and thatABΨ′(z)=Ψ˜′(z).The last equality implies up to translationABΨ(z)=Ψ˜(z)and separating the real parts we haveABx(u,v)=x˜(u,v).It follows that the transformations (4.1) on the functiong(z)correspond to the rotations and then translations of the surface S. On the other hand every rotation can be presented as a product AB of two matrices of the above form. This proves the assertion. □Remark 4.1The second transformation (4.1) can be considered as a special case of the first one withα=∞.Remark 4.2The transformations on the functiong(z)in Theorem 4.1 form a group isomorphic to the special orthogonal groupSO(3).In this section we deal with some families of polynomial minimal surfaces from Xu and Wang (2008, 2010). These surfaces were supposed as candidates for use in the CAD works.Consider first the families of quintic parametric minimal surfaces examined in Xu and Wang (2010). They have a parametric form (we use the notations of Xu and Wang, 2010)r1(u,v)=(X1(u,v),Y1(u,v),Z1(u,v)),whereX1(u,v)=a1(u5−10u3v2+5uv4)+e1u(u2−3v2),Y1(u,v)=a1(v5−10u2v3+5u4v)+e1v(v2−3u2),Z1(u,v)=304|a1e1|−a1e1(u4−6u2v2+v4)−30|a1e1|+a1e1uv(u2−v2).Whena1e1>0the surface is denotedr1¯(u,v)and ifa1e1<0the surface is denotedr1̲(u,v). Fig. 5.1represents a view of the surfacer1¯(u,v)witha1=1,e1=5,u,v∈[−4,4], whereas Fig. 5.2represents a view of the surfacer1̲(u,v)witha1=1,e1=−5,u,v∈[−4,4].Now we are looking for the resemblance of the surfaces of these two families. For simplicity consider the caser1¯(u,v)witha1=e1=1andr1̲(u,v)witha1=−e1=1. Using Theorem 3.1 we can find equations of these surfaces in canonical principal parameters and calculate their normal curvatures. It turns out that they are both equal to92153/4u2+v2(9+2153/4u2+v2)2.According to Theorem A these surfaces coincide up to position in the space. A more detailed study, using Theorems 3.1 and 4.1, shows thatr1̲(u,v)can be obtained fromr1¯(u,v)by a transformation of the parametersu→ucos⁡π8+vsin⁡π8,v→−usin⁡π8+vcos⁡π8,and then a rotation of angle5π/8around the third axis.More generally the normal curvature of the surfacer1¯(u,v)with shape parametersa1,e1is equal to the normal curvature of the surfacer1̲(u,v)with shape parametersa1,−e1.According to Theorem A these surfaces coincide up to position in the space, even though their representatives in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2 look different. Sor1¯(u,v)andr1̲(u,v)is one and the same family. Moreover, using Corollary 3.3, we can prove that any surface of these families is homothetic to the minimal surface generated via the Weierstrass formula with the functionsf(z)=z2,g(z)=z. Using the same arguments we can see that these families coincide with the families of conjugate surfaces ofr1¯(u,v)andr1̲(u,v), see also Proposition 4 in Xu and Wang (2010).Analogously in Xu and Wang (2008) the following families of parametric polynomial minimal surfaces are considered and some properties are obtained for each family:r1(u,v)=(X1(u,v),Y1(u,v),Z1(u,v)),whereX1(u,v)=a1(u6−15u4v2+15u2v4−v6)+i1(u2−v2),Y1(u,v)=2a1(3u5v−10u3v3+3uv5)−2i1uv,Z1(u,v)=32|a1i1|−a1i1(u4−6u2v2+v4)−26|a1i1|+a1i1uv(u2−v2),andr2(u,v)=(X2(u,v),Y2(u,v),Z2(u,v)),whereX2(u,v)=2a2(3u5v−10u3v3+3uv5)+2i2uv,Y2(u,v)=−a2(u6−15u4v2+15u2v4−v6)+i2(u2−v2),Z2(u,v)=32|a2i2|+a2i2(u4−6u2v2+v4)−26|a2i2|−a2i2uv(u2−v2).Using again Theorem 3.1 and Theorem A we see that these two families coincide. More precisely every surfacer1(u,v)with some shape parametersa1,i1coincides up to position in the space with the surfacer2(u,v)witha2=a1,i2=i1as well as e.g. with the surfacer1(u,v)with shape parametersa1,−i1. Figs. 5.3 and 5.4represent the casea1=4,i1=2000,u,v∈[−4,4].Moreover every surface of these families is homothetic to the minimal surface generated by the Weierstrass formula withf(z)=z,g(z)=z2.
