@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The concept of efficiency in groups postulates that a coalition of firms has to record a smaller distance toward the aggregate technology frontier compared with the sum of individual distances. Efficiency analysis (either allocative or technical) is defined with respect to cooperative firm game in order to provide operational distance functions, the so-called pseudo-distance functions. These pseudo-distances belong to the core interior of the allocative firm game, in other terms, any given firm coalition may always improve its allocative efficiency. We prove that such a result is impossible for technical efficiency, i.e., the technical efficiency cannot increase for all possible coalitions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The aggregation of indexes, scores or utility functions is an important feature in many fields such as microeconomics and the social choice theory as well. Gorman’s overlapping theorem (1968), based on additive separability, is the corner stone of many developments in welfare economics (see Blackorby, Donaldson, & Auersperg, 1981; Blackorby & Donaldson, 1982) and in production economics (see Blackorby et al., 1978). Along this line, the aggregation of the Debreu–Farrell efficiency index is investigated by Färe and Lovell (1988). The aggregation of industry efficiency, i.e. for a group of firms, is analyzed by Färe, Grosskopf, and Li (1992), Li (1995), and Li and Ng (1995), and also by Zelenyuk (2006) in the Malmquist index case, among others.An impossibility result is outlined by Blackorby and Russell (1999). Any efficiency measure related to a group of firms cannot be decomposed into the sum of each firm’s individual efficiency. This impossibility is partly solved in welfare economics by use cooperative games approaches, precisely by the application of Shapley’s (1953) value (Shorrocks, 1999, 2013) and the Nested Shapley Value (Chantreuil & Trannoy, 1999, 2013). Mussard and Peypoch (2006) investigate Owen’s value for the measurement of industry productivity. The authors bring out a Malmquist productivity index decomposition for a group of firms in which the contribution (the imputation) of each firm to the overall amount of the industry productivity is captured. Those results, relying on cooperative games and on specific values, provide a partial aggregation. The imputation is not necessarily grounded on the same axiomatic shape compared to the efficiency (productivity) index to be decomposed. In some cases, the sum of the contributions of each firm is not equal to the overall productivity: the axiom of aggregate efficiency used in cooperative games is sometimes violated.Another line of research, not investigated in this paper, is devoted to the measurement of productivity and efficiency (super-efficiency) with respect to DEA (data envelopment analysis). The concept of super-efficiency is first introduced by Andersen and Petersen (1993) in DEA frameworks. The decision making unit (DMU), which is under evaluation, is temporarily excluded from the data set in order to determine whether or not this unit improves the score of efficiency, i.e., the performance of the firm.2This technique has been further explored in DEA models aiming at detecting outliers (see among others Banker & Chang, 2006) or aiming at detecting infeasibilities (see for instance the discussion between Chen, 2005, and Soleimani-damaneh, Jahanshahloo, & Foroughi, 2006).2When one DMU under evaluation is excluded from the firm, we retrieve the idea of marginal contribution used in cooperative games. Lozano (2012) introduces the link between cooperative games and DEA models in order to show that the organizations may take benefit from cooperation when they share data about inputs and outputs. Lozano (2013) also introduces production games in which different organizations have the possibility to merge. Accordingly, two scenarios are itemized. The organizations join a coalition either by using their own technologies or by merging their technologies. Both production games are balanced so that the core of the game is non-empty. The organizations improve their profit when they take benefit from a common and joint technology.In the present paper, we follow Lozano (2013) without exploring DEA models. We keep the idea that the cooperation may improve allocative efficiency. The notion of super-efficiency has been associated with DEA models about the performance of DMUs, whereas it seems also natural to connect it to the measurement of allocative and technical efficiencies of industries. We introduce efficiency in groups on the basis of aggregate technologies, i.e., technologies of firm coalitions. In our framework, the efficiency in groups is embodied by the cooperation between firms, for which either allocative or technical efficiency may be improved.3We examine efficiency in groups without invoking DEA although our approach could be adapted to DEA when the number of firms is not too important (see Deng & Papadimitriou, 1994).3The performance of a firm is gauged by excluding temporarily that group from all possible firm coalitions. The concept of efficiency in groups is related to super-efficiency in the sense that the underlying game is concave.We first recognize that the work introduced by Briec, Dervaux, and Leleu (2003), about the aggregation of directional distance functions, may be generalized. In spite of the impossibility result outlined by Blackorby and Russell (1999), Briec et al. (2003) introduce the way to compute directional distance functions for a group of firms (structural technical efficiency), and accordingly, they find necessary and sufficient conditions to maintain an exact aggregation, i.e., the structural technical efficiency is decomposable into the sum of individual technical efficiencies associated with each firm. If the necessary and sufficient conditions (such as identical firm technologies) are not invoked, Blackorby and Russell’s (1999) result holds: the exact aggregation is impossible and a positive aggregation bias arises. The distance of the firm group is always greater or equal to the sum of the distances related to each firm. This result is proven independently by Färe, Grosskopf, and Zelenyuk (2008).In our model, the structural technical efficiency is computed by assuming that the firm (group) under evaluation is temporarily excluded from all possible firm coalitions it may belong to. The building-block pattern of our approach is then the possibility to consider coalitions within a cooperative game layout, namely a firm game, in which the concept of value enables pseudo-distance functions to be deduced. We prove that the firm game is always super-additive, and as a consequence, the aggregation bias is positive: firm coalitions cannot improve their technical efficiency. On the contrary, in allocative firm games, the result is reversed: the game is sub-additive and the allocative bias is negative. Hence, firm coalitions record a better allocative efficiency compared with the sum of their individual allocative efficiencies. The cooperation between firms always improves allocative efficiency. The result is attractive because the solution derived from the allocative firm game is in the core interior of the game if the allocative bias is submodular. This solution is called pseudo-allocative distance function since it satisfies the property of linear homogeneity in the same manner as the allocative distance function. We also show that the exact aggregation condition provides an unstable solution since it is not located in the core interior of the firm game. Finally, an allocative fixed frontier game is introduced in order to capture the role of the technical efficiency when the information about the technologies of all coalitions is not complete. Comparing the imputations of the allocative firm game with that of the allocative fixed frontier game enables some trade-off to be discussed.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the following definitions: the directional distance function, the technology, and the aggregation bias for a group of firms. In Section 3, we examine cooperative firm games, the notion of efficiency in groups, and the concepts of core and imputation. In Section 4, we prove that firm games cannot yield an increase of technical efficiency for all firm coalitions. In Section 5, we show that allocative firm game provides efficient firm groups, since the allocative efficiency can always be improved. The solution of the allocative firm game, the so-called pseudo-allocative distance function, is investigated in Section 6. In Section 7, a discussion outlines the trade-off between allocative and technical efficiency improvements. Section 8 closes the article and exposes several possible extensions.A production technology describes how inputsx=(x1,⋯,xn)∈R+nare transformed into outputsy=(y1,…,ym)∈R+m. The production possibility set T is the set of all feasible input and output vectors:T=(x,y)∈R+n+m:xcanproducey.It satisfies the following assumptions4See Shephard (1970) for the analysis of their implications on technology.4(T1):(0,0)∈T,(0,y)∈T⇒y=0i.e., no free lunch;(T2): the setA(x)=(u,y)∈T:u⩽xof dominating observations is bounded∀x∈R+n, i.e., infinite outputs cannot be obtained from a finite input vector;(T3): T is closed;(T4):∀z=(x,y)∈T,(x,-y)⩽(u,-v)⇒(u,v)∈T, i.e., fewer outputs can always be produced with more inputs, and inversely;(T5): T is convex;(T6):∀λ⩾0,(x,y)∈T⇒(λx,λy)∈T(constant returns to scale).The directional distance function introduced by Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1996, 1998)5See also Chambers and Färe (1998), Chambers (2002), and Färe and Primont (2006) for more details on directional distance functions.5DT:R+n+m×R+n+m⟶R+involving a simultaneous input and output variation in the direction of a pre-assigned vectorg=(gi,go)∈-R+n×R+mis defined as:DT(x,y;g)=supδδ∈R:(x-δgi,y+δgo)∈T.In the sequel, we do not investigate the cases of infeasibilities for whichDT(x,y;g)=-∞, the directional distance being such thatDT(x,y;g)⩾0.We analyze the behavior ofK, a group of|K|firms with technologyTk, wherek∈K≔{1,…,|K|}. Briec et al. (2003) define the aggregation bias as follows:AB(K;g)≔DT∑k∈K(xk,yk);g-∑k∈KDTk(xk,yk;g).It provides the loss of technical efficiency due to the cooperation between the firms of groupK. If the aggregation bias is nil, the exact aggregation condition is:DT∑k∈K(xk,yk);g=∑k∈KDTk(xk,yk;g).Briec et al. (2003) show under (T1)–(T4) that the aggregation bias is nil if the technologies are identical and when the input set is one-dimensional. Under the additional assumptions (T5)–(T6), the bias is nil if the firms use the same technique. We will see that those results do not tell us the whole story about the potential efficiency that the firms could capture when they form some coalitions. For that purpose, we study the aggregate technology of any firm coalition within a cooperative game framework.The aggregate technology of a groupSis expressed asTS, whereSis any subset of the grand coalitionK={1,2,…,|K|}. The literature on technology aggregation assumes that all firms merge without any exception. In the sequel, the aggregated technology depends on the technology of the firms, which decide to make a coalition only:Definition 3.1A coalitionS⊂Kis composed of|S|merging firms(|S|⩾2), for which the technology of the group is denoted byTS:(TG)TS≔∑k∈S(xk,yk)∈R+n+m:∑k∈Sxkcan produce∑k∈Syk≡∑k∈STk.If all firms merge, then the technology of the grand coalition isTK. The firms amongKthat form some coalitions are identified to be the players of a firm game.Definition 3.2A firm game is a collection{K,FDTS:S⊂K}such that:(x,y):2K→R+n+m∀S∈2K,S≠∅,where(x,y)(S)≔∑k∈Sxk,yk∈TS,withFDTS:2K→R+n+m→R+,FDTS=DTS∘(x,y),and(x,y){∅}≔0,FDTS{∅}≔0byconvention.The firm game or the characteristic functionFDTSprovides the value of the directional distance function related to any given firm coalition.6Note that the game could be adapted to other distance functions: output orientated, input orientated, etc.6With the above notations, we get:FDTK(K)≔DTK((x,y)(K);g)=DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g,FDTS(S)≔DTSx,yS;g=DTS∑k∈Sxk,yk;g.The firm game may be either concave super-efficient or convex sub-efficient or monotonic.Definition 3.3A concave [resp. convex] super [sub]-efficient firm game is, for allS1,S2⊂KwithS1∩S2≠∅, given by:(SU[B]PEF★)FDTS1∪S2S1∪S2⩽[⩾]FDTS1(S1)+FDTS2(S2)-FDTS1∩S2S1∩S2.The game is simply monotonic if for allS1⊆S2⊂K:(MON)FDTS1(S1)⩽FDTS2(S2).Efficiency in groups is related to concave games, i.e., to super-efficiency. It is different, but not so far, from the one introduced by Andersen and Petersen (1993), in which a DMU is temporarily excluded from the data set in order to determine whether or not this unit improves the score of efficiency. In the firm game, super-efficiency consists in adding one firm (or a group of firmsS2) to an existing group of firms(S1)in order to obtain an improvement of technical efficiency. In other words, the cooperation between firms improves the overall technical efficiency of the group of firms.7Strictly speaking (SUPEF★) postulates that adding the groupS2toS1, i.e.S1∪S2, yields an inefficiency that is lower than the sum of each inefficiency plus the inefficiency of both groups.7Remark that a super[sub]-efficient firm game is equivalently characterized by the fact that the mapS↦FDTS(S)is sub[super]modular.Super-efficiency is also closely connected to the notion of sub-additivity of the characteristic function. Both concepts enable the solutions of the firm game to be further characterized (the non vacuity of the core of the game).Definition 3.4The firm game is super-additive [resp. sub-additive] if, for allS1,S2⊂Ksuch thatS1∩S2=∅,(SU[B]PAD)FDTS1∪S2S1∪S2⩾[⩽]FDTS1S1+FDTS2S2.Clearly, a super-additive firm game yields to the coalitionS1∪S2a greater distance compared to the sum of the distances, in words, the coalition records a lower technical efficiency. On the contrary, a sub-additive firm game postulates that the coalition takes benefit from any union since its technical efficiency is (at least) higher.In the sequel, in order to analyze super-efficient firm groups, we have to know whether the coalition implies individual efficiency and/or aggregate efficiency.Definition 3.5The vectorD‾≔dK1(x,y;g),…,dK|K|(x,y;g)∈R+|K|is an imputation if there are both(i)(Strong) Individual Efficiency:dKk(x,y;g)⩽DTkxk,yk;g,∀k∈K(strong if the inequality is strict for at least one k);Aggregate Efficiency:∑k∈KdKk(x,y;g)=DTK∑k∈K(xk,yk);g.The imputation yields the concept of rationality of each firm. Actually, each firm decides to cooperate if it obtains more efficiency resulting from the cooperation[dKk(x,y;g)]than the stand alone solution[DTkxk,yk;g]. The aggregate efficiency indicates that the sharing rule is relevant: the overall efficiency of groupKDTK∑k∈K(xk,yk);gis decomposed into the efficiency contribution of each firm [dKk(x,y;g)].Finally, in order to know whether the solution lies in the core of the game, we define the following:Definition 3.6The core of the firm game{K,FDTS:S⊂K}is the setCDTof all admissible imputationsD‾=dK1(x,y;g),…,dK|K|(x,y;g)∈R+|K|defined by:CDT=D‾∈R+|K|:∑k∈SdKk(x,y;g)⩽FDTS(S),∑k∈KdKk(x,y;g)=DTK∑k∈K(xk,yk);g,∀S⊂K.The first term in bracelets indicates that an imputation is included in the core of the firm game if there is no blocking coalitionS⊂K, i.e., no coalition that gets a more important technical efficiency compared with its imputation. The second term represents the aggregate efficiency.Before outlining the implications of super-efficiency on the core of the firm game, we provide in this Section the conditions for which the solution of the firm game is not stable. This may arise when the core of the firm game is either reduced to one point (the exact aggregation case) or outside the core.The first result states that the standard aggregation of the technologies yields a core with an empty interior (the solution being one point).Theorem 4.1LetH(p,w)≔(x,y):w.y-p.x⩽0,(p,w)⩾0. Suppose that for allk∈K,Tksatisfies axioms(T1)–(T4).Let{K,FDTS:S⊂K}be the firm game associated with the characteristic functionFDT. The points below are equivalent.(i) For all groups of firmsK,AB(K;g)=0.(ii) The mapDTS(·;g)is linear.(iii) One of the two following conditions holds:(iii.a)T1=⋯=T|K|,TK=∑k∈STk=R+n+m∩H(p,w)with(m=1)andgi≠0;(iii.b)T1=⋯=T|K|,TK=∑k∈STk=R+n+m∩H(p,w)withgi=0.(iv) The coreCDTis reduced to one pointD‾=(DT1(x1,y1;g),…,DT|K|(x|K|,y|K|;g))∈R+|K|.The equivalence between (i), (ii) and (iii) is due to Briec et al. (2003). Let us prove that (i) and (iv) are equivalent.(i)⇒(iv): Suppose that the aggregation condition holds. Then∑k∈KDTk(xk,yk;g)=FDTK(K)=DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g. Consequently,D‾is an imputation. Now, to prove thatD‾lies in the core, we need to prove that for allS⊂Kone has∑k∈SDTk(xk,yk;g)⩾FDTS(S)=DTS∑k∈Sxk,yk;g.Pick somek′∈K. We have(1)DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g=∑k∈KDTk(xk,yk;g)=∑k∈K⧹{k′}DTk(xk,yk;g)+DTk′(xk′,yk′;g).HoweverDTK∑k∈K(xk,yk);g⩾DTk∈K⧹{k′}∑k∈K⧹{k′}(xk,yk);g+DTk′(xk′,yk′;g).It follows from Eq. (1) that∑k∈K⧹{k′}DTk(xk,yk;g)⩾DTk∈K⧹{k′}∑k∈K⧹{k′}(xk,yk);g.Since the aggregation bias holds, we have∑k∈K⧹{k′}DTk(xk,yk;g)⩽DTk∈K⧹{k′}∑k∈K⧹{k′}(xk,yk);g,and consequently(2)∑k∈K⧹{k′}DTk(xk,yk:g)=DTk∈K⧹{k′}∑k∈K⧹{k′}(xk,yk);g=FDTK⧹{k′}(K⧹{k′}).Let us choose a sequence{k′:k′∈K⧹S}by mathematical induction, we deduce thatD‾is in the core. Since from Eq. (2), the strong efficiency is available for any sequencek′, thenD‾is the core, which is reduced to one point.(iv)⇒(i): Suppose thatD‾=(DT1(x1,y1;g),…,DT|K|(x|K|,y|K|;g))is an imputation. By the definition of an imputation:∑k∈KDTk(xk,yk:g)=FDTK(K)=DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g,hence the aggregation condition holds.□The previous result may be extended to the case where the technology is convex and where constant returns to scale hold.Corollary 4.1Suppose that for allk∈K,Tksatisfies axioms(T1)–(T6), withT1=⋯=T|K|, such that (TG) holds and all firms of the group use the same technique, i.e., for allk∈S,xik=αi,jxjk,ymk=βm,nynkandymk=γm,ixik,αi,j,βl,q,γl,iare constants fori,j∈{1,…,m}andl,q∈{1,…,n}. Then the coreCDTof the firm game{K,FDTS:S⊂K}is reduced to one pointD‾=(DT1(x1,y1;g),…,DT|K|(x|K|,y|K|;g))∈R+|K|.From Briec et al. (2003) the conditions state in the corollary imply thatAB(K;g)=0. From Theorem 4.1, the result follows directly.□The conclusion about the literature on exact aggregation is clear. The aggregation bias is nil if, and only if, the core is reduced to one point (i.e. a core with an empty interior). The sole (potential) gain for each firm is the stand alone solution, so that the amount of inputs/outputs actually consumed/produced by the firms remains invariant.We show that if the condition of identical technologies is relaxed, then the solution is also an unstable set. The solution is sub-efficient since coalitions of firms never improve their technical efficiency.Proposition 4.1Suppose that for allk∈K,Tksatisfies axioms(T1)–(T4)and assume that (TG) holds, i.e.,TS=∑k∈STk. Then, for all{K,FDTS:S⊂K}:(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧(TG)⇒(1)[AB(S;g)⩾0]⇒(2)(SUPAD)⇒(3)(MON).[⇒(1)]: We prove that the aggregation bias is non-negative for any given coalitionS⊂K. We start from the definition of the distance function, and for allk∈K:xk-DTk(xk,yk;g)gi,yk+DTk(xk,yk;g)go∈Tk⇔DTkxk-DTk(xk,yk;g)gi,yk+DTk(xk,yk;g)go;g⩾0.Invoking (TG), for any givenS⊂Kwe have:∑k∈Sxk-DTk(xk,yk;g)gi,∑k∈Syk+DTk(xk,yk;g)go∈∑k∈STk=TS⇔DTS∑k∈Sxk-∑k∈SDTk(xk,yk;g)gi,∑k∈Syk+∑k∈SDTk(xk,yk;g)go;g⩾0.It follows that:DTS∑k∈Sxk,∑k∈Syk;g⩾∑k∈SDTkxk,yk;g⇔AB(S;g)⩾0.[⇒(2)]: Suppose thatS1∩S2=∅. This implies that,TS1∪S2=TS1+TS2. Moreover∑k∈S1xk-DTS1∑k∈S1xk,∑k∈S1yk;ggi,∑k∈S1yk+DTS1∑k∈S1xk,∑k∈S1yk;ggo∈∑k∈S1Tk=TS1and∑k∈S2xk-DTS2∑k∈S2xk,∑k∈S2yk;ggi,∑k∈S2yk+DTS2∑k∈S2xk,∑k∈S2yk;ggo∈∑k∈S2Tk=TS2,then (SUPAD) immediately follows.[⇒(3)]: Suppose thatS2⊆S1⊆K. By (TG):TS2=∑k∈S2Tk⊆∑k∈S1Tk=TS1, the inclusion being not strict since the equality of the technologies may arise. We have, by construction,TS1=TS2∪(S1⧹S2). Note that{S1⧹S2}∩S2=∅. Hence, invoking[AB(S;g)⩾0]and (SUPAD), we get that:(3)DTS1∑k∈S1xk,yk;g⩾DTS2∑k∈S2xk,yk;g+DTS1⧹S2∑k∈S1⧹S2xk,yk;g.From Eq. (3), sinceDTS1⧹S2∑k∈S1⧹S2xk,yk;g⩾0we deduce thatDTS1∑k∈S1xk,yk;g⩾DTS2∑k∈S2xk,yk;g.ConsequentlyFDTS2S2⩽FDTS1S1. AsS2⊆S1⊆K, we get (MON). □This result is crucial: if the overall aggregated technology is the sum of individual technologies, then the positive aggregation bias is always obtained and the game is super-additive. Then, the firms are always sub-efficient in groups (MON). In consequence, the imputationD‾is outside the core interior. It is worth mentioning that the firm game is concerned with distance functions, i.e., cost functions by duality. In this respect, in accordance with the cost-sharing theory, super-additivity implies that bigger coalitions of firms face a more important cost (compared with small coalitions), then the core has an empty interior.The outlook of the last Section is quite negative: it seems impossible, under the traditional axioms (T1)–(T4), to conceive firm coalitions that yield an improvement of technical efficiency. If the convexity of the technologies is added to the analysis, the result remains negative. In contrast to this, we show in this Section that firm coalitions may improve their allocative efficiency. Indeed, the allocative distance function is always sub-additive, and in some cases, the firm group is super-efficient.Before outlining overall and allocative efficiency, let us introduce industrial and structural efficiencies.Definition 5.1For any given coalition of firmsS⊂K, we get in the direction of g,•The industrial technical efficiency index:ITE(S,p,w;g)=∑k∈STEkxk,yk,p,w;g=∑k∈SDTkxk,yk;g.•The structural technical efficiency index:STE(S,p,w;g)=DTS∑k∈Sxk,yk;g.Following Chambers et al. (1998), it is well known that one of the dual representation of the input distance function is given, for all firmsk∈K, by the profit function:Πk(p,w)=supxk,ykw.yk-p.xk:(xk,yk)∈Tk,where(p,w)∈R+n+mdenote an input–output price vector such thatw.go+p.gi≠0. From Chambers et al. (1998), overall efficiency in the direction of g is the difference between the profit function and the profit of the firm. The overall efficiency of firm k is then:OEk(xk,yk,p,w;g)=supδ∈R:w.(yk+δgo)-p.(xk-δgi)⩽Πk(p,w)=Πk(p,w)-w.yk+p.xkw.g0+p.gi.In this respect, industrial and structural efficiencies may be defined in accordance with cooperative games.Definition 5.2For any given coalition of firmsS⊂K, we get in the direction of g,•The industrial overall efficiency index8See Briec et al. (2003) who demonstrate the link between the input distance function and the corresponding industrial and structural efficiencies.8:IOE(S,p,w;g)=∑k∈SOEkxk,yk,p,w;g.•The structural overall efficiency index:SOE(S,p,w;g)=OE∑k∈Sxk,yk,p,w;g.The former gauges the possibility for coalitionSto improve its industrial profit (given that each firm of the coalition efficiently produces). The latter measures the global efficiency of the coalition.The allocative efficiency is the difference between overall and technical efficiency. As a consequence of the two previous definitions, we get:Definition 5.3For any given coalition of firmsS⊂K, we get in the direction of g,•The industrial allocative efficiency index:IAE(S,p,w;g)=IOE(S,p,w;g)-ITE(S,p,w;g).•The structural allocative efficiency index:SAE(S,p,w;g)=SOE(S,p,w;g)-STE(S,p,w;g).In order to show that the cooperation may improve the structural allocative efficiency of any group of firms, we start from the fact thatSOE(K,p,w;g)=IOE(K,p,w;g). By Koopmans’ Theorem (Koopmans, 1957), without imposing conditions on the firms’ technology, the profit of groupSdefined to beΠ(S,p,w)is equal to the sum of the profits of the firms being inS:Π(S,p,w)=∑k∈SΠk(p,w),wheneverΠk(p,w)<∞∀k∈S.Hence:SOE(S,p,w;g)=OE∑k∈Sxk,yk=Π(S,p,w)-w·∑k∈Syk+p·∑k∈Sxkw·g0+p·gi=∑k∈SΠk(p,w)-w·∑k∈Syk+p·∑k∈Sxkw·g0+p·gi=∑k∈SΠk(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·g0+p·gi=∑k∈SOEkxk,yk,p,w;g=IOE(S,p,w;g).According to the previous expression, the structural allocative efficiency becomes a function of the individual profits and the overall technical efficiency. In this respect, it is possible to define this allocative efficiency in groups as a distance function in the direction of g.Definition 5.4For any given coalition of firmsS⊂K, the allocative distance function in the direction of g of coalitionSand of the grand coalitionKare given by, respectively:FDTS★(S)≡DTS★x,yS;g≔∑k∈SΠk(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·go+p·gi-DTS∑k∈Sxk,yk;g,FDTK★(K)≡DTK★x,yK;g≔∑k∈KΠk(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·go+p·gi-DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g,whereΠk(p,w)<∞for allk∈S.From the above definitions, the technical aggregation bias of coalitionSis:AB(S;g)=DTS∑k∈S(xk,yk);g-∑k∈SDTk(xk,yk;g)=IAE(S,p,w;g)-SAE(S,p,w;g).In the same manner, the allocative aggregation bias of coalitionSis defined to be:(4)AB★(S;g)≔DTS★∑k∈S(xk,yk);g-∑k∈SDTk★(xk,yk;g).As a consequence, without assumption on the technologies of the firms, it comes from Definitions 5.2 and 5.3 and Eq. (4) that:(5)AB★(S;g)=SAE(S,p,w;g)-IAE(S,p,w;g)=-AB(S;g)⩽0,andSAE(S,p,w;g)=DTS★x,y(S);g;IAE(S,p,w;g)=∑k∈SDTk★x,y({k});g.An immediate corollary of Theorem 4.1, is that, under (T1)–(T4) and the assumption of equal technologiesT1=⋯=T|K|, the solution of the firm game{K,FDTS:S⊂K}provides an empty interior such that:IAE(K,p,w;g)-SAE(K,p,w;g)=AB(K;g)=-AB★(K;g)=0.In contrast to this, it is possible to investigate allocative firm games{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}that imply a core with a non-empty interior. The characteristic function of the allocative firm gameFDTS★(·)represents the allocative efficiency of a firm coalitionS, which is implicitly defined by the difference between the structural overall efficiency and the structural technical efficiency.Definition 5.5An allocative firm game is a collection{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}such that:x,y:2K→R+n+m∀S∈2K,S≠∅,wherex,y(S)≔∑k∈Sxk,yk∈TS,withFDTS★:2K→R+n+m→R+,FDTS★=DTS★∘x,ywhereFDTS★S=∑k∈SΠk(p,w)-w.yk+p.xkw.go+p.gi-DTSx,yS;g;Πk(p,w)<∞∀k∈S,andx,y{∅}≔0,FDTS★{∅}≔0byconvention.The next result is the dual of Proposition 4.1. We show that the allocative aggregation bias is non-positive and it implies that the characteristic functionFDT★of the allocative firm game{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}is sub-additive. We use an additional condition in order to characterize concave (super-efficient) games. Indeed, if the allocative aggregation biasAB★(·;g)is submodular,(6)AB★(S1∪S2;g)⩽AB★(S1;g)+AB★(S2;g)-AB★(S1∩S2;g),then the core of the allocative firm gameCDT★is non void.Proposition 5.1For all{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}, the two following assertions hold:(i)(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧(TG)⇒(1)[AB★(S;g)⩽0]⇒(2)(SUBAD)AB★(·;g)issubmodular⇔(SUPEF★)⇒[CDT★≠∅].(i)(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧(TG)⇒(1)[AB★(S;g)⩽0]⇒(2)(SUBAD):[⇒(1)]: From Proposiotion 4.1 for all firm games{K,FDTS:S⊂K}, under (T1)–(T4)AB(S;g)⩾0. By duality, Eq. (5),AB★(S;g)⩽0.[⇒(2)]: The proof is then similar to that of Proposition 4.1.Suppose thatAB★(·;g)is submodular, then for allS1,S2⊂Ksuch thatS1∩S2≠∅:AB★(S1∪S2;g)⩽AB★(S1;g)+AB★(S2;g)-AB★(S1∩S2;g).From Eq. (4), the last expression becomes:DTS1∪S2★∑k∈S1∪S2(xk,yk);g-∑k∈S1∪S2DTk★(xk,yk;g)⩽DTS1★∑k∈S1(xk,yk);g-∑k∈S1DTk★(xk,yk;g)+DTS2★∑k∈S2(xk,yk);g-∑k∈S2DTk★(xk,yk;g)-DTS1∩S2★∑k∈S1∩S2(xk,yk);g+∑k∈S1∩S2DTk★(xk,yk;g).As,∑k∈S1∪S2DTk★(xk,yk;g)=∑k∈S1DTk★(xk,yk;g)+∑k∈S2DTk★(xk,yk;g)-∑k∈S1∩S2DTk★(xk,yk;g),we obtain:FDTS1∪S2★S1∪S2⩽FDTS1★(S1)+FDTS2(S2)-FDTS1∩S2★S1∩S2.Then the submodularity ofAB★(·;g)is equivalent to (SUPEF★). The game is then concave super-efficient. By Shapley (1972), the core is non-empty.□Contrary to Proposition 4.1, we have shown that (SUBAD) is always matched in allocative firm games. An immediate implication is the respect of the individual rationality of each firm. Furthermore, the submodularity ofAB★(·;g)has an immediate interpretation. AsAB★(·;g)=-AB(·;g):AB★(S1∪S2;g)⩽AB★(S1;g)+AB★(S2;g)+AB(S1∩S2;g).The termsAB★(S1∪S2;g)andAB(S1∩S2;g)represent, respectively, the loss of allocative efficiency issued from the cooperation and the loss of technical efficiency that results from the use of a joint technology. Without assumption on the technology of the firms, the submodularity ofAB★(·;g)postulates that if the loss of allocative efficiency that results from the cooperation is lower than the individual allocative losses plus the loss of technical efficiency, then the game is concave and the core is non-empty. It is noteworthy that other (stronger) conditions may yield concave games, for instance when the joint technology yields a perfect allocative efficiency (FDTS1∩S2★S1∩S2=0). The concavity of the games may also be related to the concavity of the distance functions that follow from the convexity (T5) of the technology (see Briec et al. (2003)).A general allocative firm value of the firm game is defined in order to show that the solution lying in the core is tractable for empirical investigations.The allocative firm value represents the mean contribution of each firm to the overall amount of the allocative efficiency of the group. This value (which is the cost of allocative inefficiency inherent to each firm) is defined to be the expected amount of marginal impactsFDTS∪{k}★S∪{k}-FDTS★S, where the weight associated with each marginal impact isλS. Then, the allocative firm value is compatible with many traditional values such as the Shapley value, Weber’s value or the weighted Shapley value (Chun, 1991). In consequence, the contribution of each firm to the overall amount of the allocative efficiency of the group becomes an operational issue in the sense that it may be empirically computed with respect to any given value defined on marginal impacts.Definition 6.1For all allocative firm games{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}, an allocative firm value respecting aggregate efficiency is given by:v★kK≔∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTS∪{k}★S∪{k}-FDTS★S,∑S⊆K⧹{k}λS=1suchthatλS⩾0∀S⊆K⧹{k}and∑k∈Kv★kK=FDTK★K.In the Theorem below, we show that the allocative firm value is always in the core interior of the allocative firm game.Theorem 6.1Under[(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧[AB★(·;g)submodular]∧(TG)]and for all allocative firm games{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}, the two following statements hold:(i)D‾★≔v★1K,…,v★KK∈R+|K|is an imputation;D‾★is in the coreCDT★, which is non-empty, convex and compact.(i)Under(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧(TG), we have (SUBAD), see Proposition 5.1, thus:FDTS∪{k}★S∪{k}⩽FDTS★S+FDTk★{k},∀S⊂K.As∑SλS=1, we deduce that:∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTS∪{k}★S∪{k}⩽∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTS★S+∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTk★{k}.Hence,∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTS∪{k}★S∪{k}-FDTS★S⩽∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSFDTk★{k},that is,v★k(K)⩽DTkxk,yk;g,foranygivenk∈K.From the submodularity ofAB★(·;g)the allocative firm game is concave, see Proposition 5.1. Then, from Shapley (1972), the result is immediate. LetD‾★Sbe a vector ofR|K|for which its elements are:D‾★kS≔v★k(K)ifk∈S,0otherwise.On the one hand, note thatLSis a function defined asLS:R|K|→R+,D‾★S↦∑k∈Sv★k(K),which is clearly linear. Therefore, for allS⊂Kthe subsetC1≔D‾★S∈R+|K|:∑k∈Sv★k(K)⩽FDTS★(S)is a closed half-space. On the other hand, letD‾★≔(v★1(K),…,v★K(K))∈R+|K|, then the subsetC2≔D‾★∈R+|K|:∑k∈Kv★k(K)=DTK★((x,y)(K);g)is an hyperplane, that is, an intersection of a finite collection of closed half-spaces. Then,CDT★={C1∩C2}is the intersection of a finite collection of closed half-spaces. Hence, it is a closed and convex polytope. Furthermore, sincev★k(K)⩾0for allk∈Kand∑k∈Kv★k(K)=DTK★((x,y)(K);g), thusCDT★is bounded and since it is closed and the dimension is finite, therefore it is compact.□Since the imputationD‾★lies in the core, the valuev★k(K)of each firm k, which corresponds to their contribution to the overall allocative efficiency of the group, makes sense. Firm coalitions allow allocative inefficiency to be reduced. This is due to fact that the game is super-efficient. On the other hand, the firm valuevk★(K)is embodied with almost the same properties respected by the traditional directional distance function. Precisely, in the same manner than the allocative distance function, the allocative firm value is linearly homogeneous. In this respect, it is denoted, from now onwards, pseudo-allocative distance functiond★k((x,y)(S);g)≔v★k(S).Proposition 6.1For all allocative firm games{K,FDTS★:S⊂K}, the allocative distance function and the pseudo-allocative distance function are linearly homogeneous, respectively:(i)DTk★x+εgi,y-εgo({k});g=DTk★x,y({k});g,∀k∈K,ε∈R+.d★kx+εgi,y-εgo(S);g=d★kx,y(S);g,∀k∈K,ε∈R+.(i)The usual directional distance function satisfies translation homotheticity [see Chambers et al. (1998)]:DTkx+εgi,y-εgo({k});g=DTkx,y({k});g+ε,∀k∈K,ε∈R+.Moreover, from allocative firm games, the profit function associated with technologyTkisΠk(p,w)<∞. Thus,∀k∈Kandε∈R+:(7)DTk★x+εgi,y-εgo({k});g=Πk(p,w)-w·yk+εw·go+p·xk+εp·giw·go+p·gi-DTkx+εgi,y-εgo({k});g=Πk(p,w)-w·yk+p·xk+ε(w·go+p·gi)w·go+p·gi-DTkx,y({k});g-ε=DTk★x,y({k});g.As for allk∈K,OEk(xk,yk,p,w;g)=Πk(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·go+p·gi,we get from (i),OEk(xk+εgi,yk-εgo,p,w;g)=OEk(xk,yk,p,w;g)+ε.Thus:d★kx+εgi,y-εgo(S);g=∑S⊆K⧹{k}λS∑ℓ∈S∪{k}OEℓ(xℓ+εgi,yℓ-εgo,p,w;g)-DTS∪{k}∑ℓ∈S∪{k}xℓ+εgi,yℓ-εgo;g-∑ℓ∈SOEℓ(xℓ+εgi,yℓ-εgo,p,w;g)+DTS∑ℓ∈Sxℓ+εgi,yℓ-εgo;g=∑S⊆K⧹{k}λS(|S|+1)ε+∑ℓ∈S∪{k}OEℓ(xℓ,yℓ,p,w;g)-(|S|+1)ε-DTS∪{k}∑ℓ∈S∪{k}xℓ,yℓ;g-|S|ε-∑ℓ∈SOEℓ(xℓ,yℓ,p,w;g)+|S|ε+DTS∑ℓ∈Sxℓ,yℓ;g=∑S⊆K⧹{k}λSd★kx,y(S);g.Just note that∑S⊆K⧹{k}λS=1, therefore:d★k((x+εgi,y-εgo)(S);g)=d★k((x,y)(S);g),and the result follows.□An illustration of the allocative firm game is provided in Appendix A.1. It shows that the pseudo-allocative distance function lies in the core of the allocative firm game.In the previous Sections, the firms of any given coalitionScoordinate themselves in order to minimize their allocative inefficiencies subject to the technology of the coalitionTS. We investigate in this Section an allocative fixed frontier game, in which the firms use the technology of the grand coalitionKonly. This makes the firms being able to evaluate implicitly the allocative efficiency resulting from either the grand coalition’s technology (allocative fixed frontier game) or all possible coalitions’ technology (e.g. allocative firm games). We can think about cases of asymmetric information. The cooperation on the basis of efficiency gains measured on all possible aggregated technologies requires a complete information between the firms when they merge (allocative firm game). However, it is not sure that the firm are able to merge their own technologies, see e.g.Lozano (2013) who compares a game with a joint technology and a game in which each firm keeps its own technology. In dual fixed frontiers games, efficiency gains are computed on the basis of the grand coalition’s technology only (i.e. on what could be the technology of the industry): this requires an hypothetical information. Each firm may evaluate its potential efficiency as if they took benefit from the technology of the industry.Contrary to the allocative firm game presented in Definition 5.5, the allocative fixed frontier game postulates that the frontier of the technology does not move. Therefore, when a firm coalitionSis created, it is assumed to use the technology of the grand coalitionTK. Thereby, a potential technical efficiency is captured implicitly in the allocative distance function, which is computed for all input–output vectors(x,y)(S)on the basis of the overall aggregate technologyTK:FDTK★,K(S)≔∑k∈SΠkK(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·go+p·gi-DTK∑k∈Sxk,yk;g,FDTK★,K(K)≔∑k∈KΠkK(p,w)-w·yk+p·xkw·go+p·gi-DTK∑k∈Kxk,yk;g,where the profit function of firm k is defined for all(p,w)∈R+n+mbyΠkK(p,w)=supxk,ykw·yk-p·xk:(xk,yk)∈TK<∞,∀k∈K.Accordingly, the allocative fixed frontier game is defined as follows.Definition 7.1An allocative fixed frontier game is a collection{K,FDTK★,K:S⊂K}such that:x,y:2K→R+n+m∀S∈2K,S≠∅,wherex,y(S)≔∑k∈Sxk,yk∈TK,withFDTK★,K:2K→R+i.e.FDTK★,KS=∑k∈SΠkK(p,w)-w.yk+p.xkw.go+p.gi-DTK∑k∈Sxk,yk;g;ΠkK(p,w)<∞∀k∈Sandx,y{∅}≔0,FDTK★,K{∅}≔0byconvention.The allocative fixed frontier game is similar to the allocative firm game, except that the exact aggregation condition holds since the fixed frontier game implies that each individual technology is replaced by that of the grand coalitionTk≔TK, for allk∈K. Hence the core of the game is reduced to one point (see Theorem 4.1). The pseudo-allocative distance function also respects the property of linear homogeneity.Metatheorem 7.1Under(T1)∧(T2)∧(T3)∧(T4)∧(TG)and for all allocative fixed frontier games{K,FDTK★,K:S⊂K}, Theorem6.1(i) and Proposition6.1hold.Straightforward.□The result of the allocative firm game may be compared with that of the fixed frontier game. This may be done by computing the difference between the imputations of each game, for each firmk∈K:Ik(K)≔d★k((x,y)(S);g)-d∼★k((x,y)(S);g),whered̃★k(·)denotes the imputation of firm k in the dual fixed frontier game.IfIk(K)<0: firm k would not take benefit from the technology of the industry, its allocative efficiency is improved in the allocative firm game.IfIk(K)>0: it would be profitable for firm k to use the technology of the industry in order to improve its allocative efficiency.IfIk(K)=0: firm k is indifferent to use the technology of the grand coalition.An illustration of the allocative fixed frontier game is provided in Appendix A.2. It shows that when a firm’s technology (say k) is coincident with that of the industry, then its allocative efficiency remains invariantFDTK★,K({k})=d∼★k(·), so thatIk(K)<0. Firm k would not take benefit from the technology of the grand coalition.
