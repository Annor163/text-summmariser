@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is a well-known compromising method for multiple criteria decision analysis. This paper develops an extended TOPSIS method with an inclusion comparison approach for addressing multiple criteria group decision-making problems in the framework of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Considering the relative agreement degrees and the importance weights of multiple decision makers, this paper presents a modified hybrid averaging method with an inclusion-based ordered weighted averaging operation for forming a collective decision environment. Based on the main structure of the TOPSIS method, this paper utilizes the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities to propose a new index for an inclusion-based closeness coefficient for ranking the alternatives. Additionally, two optimization models are established to determine the criterion weights for addressing situations in which the preference information is completely unknown or incompletely known. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a medical group decision-making problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The TOPSIS method, which was developed by Hwang and Yoon [21], is a widely used compromising method for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems. The basic rationale of the TOPSIS method is that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal solution. The criterion weights in the TOPSIS method are given a priori. Moreover, the positive-ideal solution and the negative-ideal solution are directly generated from the decision matrix [23]. In the classical TOPSIS method, all of the decision data are precisely known or are given as crisp values. However, it can be difficult to determine the data precisely because human judgments are often vague under many conditions in practice. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted on the extended TOPSIS methods within a fuzzy environment [1,2,8,14,19,20,29,30,50]. The extension of the TOPSIS method to the fuzzy environment makes it possible to address more imprecisions and uncertainties in the multiple criteria evaluations in the real world.Since the introduction of fuzzy sets, many attempts have been made to generalize the notion of fuzzy sets. Among others, Atanassov and Gargov [6] proposed the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), which are generalizations of the intuitionistic fuzzy sets [3–5]. The IVIFS is characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function, which have values that are intervals rather than exact numbers. Xu [41] defined the notion of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN) and introduced some operations on IVIFNs. The IVIFS theory provides an intuitive and computationally feasible method for handling uncertain and ambiguous properties. The IVIFSs have significant advantages when addressing imprecise and imperfect information and have been applied in a variety of fields, especially in multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems [11,12,15,16,37,39,44,45,49]. Additionally, the main structure of the TOPSIS method has been extended to the IVIFS framework to manage MCGDM problems. For example, Ye [47] proposed an extended TOPSIS method for MCGDM with IVIFNs to solve the partner selection problem in an incomplete and uncertain information environment. Tan [34] combined the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator with the Choquet integral-based Hamming distance to present an extension of the TOPSIS method for addressing an MCGDM problem. Park et al. [31] and Zhang and Yu [52] also extended the TOPSIS method to solve MCGDM problems within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Intepe et al. [22] proposed an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method to handle MCGDM problems in the technological forecasting technique selection problem.The purpose of this paper is to develop a new TOPSIS model involving an inclusion comparison approach for solving MCGDM problems within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Based on the extended concept of inclusion comparison possibilities in the IVIFS context, this paper develops a ranking procedure and incorporates it into the aggregation procedure of the IVIFN ratings. A collective decision matrix with common ratings is then constructed through the proposed inclusion-based hybrid averaging method. In contrast to the classical TOPSIS method, this paper applies weighted inclusion comparison possibilities instead of distance measures to establish a comparative index of inclusion-based closeness coefficients. Then, this paper presents an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method with an inclusion comparison approach for solving the MCGDM problem. Furthermore, for MCGDM problems in which the information about the criterion weights is completely unknown or is incompletely known a priori, two optimization models are constructed to solve for the optimal weight values and to determine the corresponding inclusion-based closeness coefficients. Finally, through an illustrative example of medical decision-making, the proposed method with the inclusion-based TOPSIS method is easy to implement and produces actionable results for MCGDM.This article is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the basic definitions and operations of IVIFSs. Section 3 first formulates an MCGDM problem within the IVIFS framework. Next, this section introduces the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities between IVIFNs, which is used to propose a new hybrid averaging operation and to form a collective decision matrix. Section 4 propounds a new comparative index of inclusion-based closeness coefficients and presents an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method. Furthermore, this section provides additional discussion on unavailable or incomplete preference information. Section 5 examines the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method by illustrating how it can be applied in practice to a medical problem of basilar artery occlusion. This section also conducts a comparative analysis using an intuitionistic fuzzy approach to demonstrate the advantage of using IVIFSs. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions.Based on the IVIFS framework, the classical TOPSIS model is extended to propound a group decision-making method with an inclusion-based aggregation process. This section reviews a few relevant definitions and operations of IVIFSs.Let X be an ordinary finite, nonempty set. Let Int([0,1]) denote the set of all closed subintervals of the unit interval [0,1]. An IVIFSA˜in X is an object that has the following form:(1)A˜={〈x,μA˜(x),νA˜(x)〉|x∈X},where the functions areμA˜: X→Int([0,1]) (x∈X→μA˜(x)⊆[0,1]) andνA˜: X→Int([0,1])(x∈X→νA˜(x)⊆[0,1]), with the condition0≤sup{μA˜(x)}+sup{νA˜(x)}≤1for every x∈X. The intervalsμA˜(x)andνA˜(x)denote, respectively, the degree of membership and the degree of non-membership of the element x∈X in the setA˜.For every IVIFSA˜in X,μA˜(x)andνA˜(x)are closed intervals instead of real numbers, and their lower and upper boundaries are denoted byμA˜−(x),μA˜+(x),νA˜−(x), andνA˜+(x), respectively. Then,A˜can be expressed as follows:(2)A˜={〈x,[μA˜−(x),μA˜+(x)],[νA˜−(x),νA˜+(x)]〉|x∈X},where the expression is subject to the condition0≤μA˜+(x)+νA˜+(x)≤1.For every x∈X, its hesitation interval (or intuitionistic fuzzy interval) relative toA˜is computed as follows:(3)πA˜(x)=[πA˜−(x),πA˜+(x)]=[1−μA˜+(x)−νA˜+(x),1−μA˜−(x)−νA˜−(x)].IfμA˜(x)=μA˜−(x)=μA˜+(x)andνA˜(x)=νA˜−(x)=νA˜+(x), then the given IVIFSA˜is reduced to an ordinary IFS. For convenience of notation, the set of all of the IVIFSs in X is denoted by IVIFS(X).LetA˜xandB˜xdenote two IVIFNs, where(4)A˜x=(μA˜(x),νA˜(x))=([μA˜−(x),μA˜+(x)],[νA˜−(x),νA˜+(x)]),(5)B˜x=(μB˜(x),νB˜(x))=([μB˜−(x),μB˜+(x)],[νB˜−(x),νB˜+(x)]),Let an ordinary number λ>0. The arithmetic operations betweenA˜xandB˜xare defined as follows:(6)A˜x⊕B˜x=([μA˜−(x)+μB˜−(x)−μA˜−(x)⋅μB˜−(x),μA˜+(x)+μB˜+(x)−μA˜+(x)⋅μB˜+(x)],[νA˜−(x)⋅νB˜−(x),νA˜+(x)⋅νB˜+(x)]),(7)A˜x⊗B˜x=([μA˜−(x)⋅μB˜−(x),μA˜+(x)⋅μB˜+(x)],[νA˜−(x)+νB˜−(x)−νA˜−(x)⋅νB˜−(x),νA˜+(x)+νB˜+(x)−νA˜+(x)⋅νB˜+(x)]),(8)λ⋅A˜x=([1−(1−μA˜−(x))λ,1−(1−μA˜+(x))λ],[(νA˜−(x))λ,(νA˜+(x))λ]),(9)(A˜x)λ=([(μA˜−(x))λ,(μA˜+(x))λ],[1−(1−νA˜−(x))λ,1−(1−νA˜+(x))λ]).Additionally, let0⋅A˜x=([0,0],[1,1])and(A˜x)0=([1,1],[0,0]).Xu [41], Xu and Chen [42], and Xu et al. [46] showed more operational laws of IVIFNs, as follows:(10)A˜x⊕B˜x=B˜x⊕A˜x,(11)A˜x⊗B˜x=B˜x⊗A˜x,(12)λ⋅(A˜x⊕B˜x)=λ⋅A˜x⊕λ⋅B˜x,λ≥0,(13)(A˜x⋅B˜x)λ=(A˜x)λ⋅(B˜x)λ,λ≥0.This section describes a decision environment based on IVIFSs for MCGDM problems. Additionally, this section presents a ranking procedure that is based on the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities in the context of IVIFSs. An inclusion-based hybrid averaging method that is suitable for fusing IVIFN data is then proposed as an aggregating approach for forming a collective decision matrix.Consider an MCGDM problem in which the ratings of the alternative evaluations are expressed as IVIFSs. Assume that E={E1, E2, …, EK} is the set of decision makers involved in the decision process. Let ϖ=(ϖ1, ϖ2, …, ϖK) be the weight vector of the decision makers, where ϖk∈[0, 1] for k=1, 2, …, K and∑k=1Kϖk=1. Let A1, A2, ⋯, and Amrepresent the non-dominated alternatives from which the decision makers must choose, where m represents the number of alternatives, and let A(={A1, A2, …, Am}) be an alternative set. Let x1, x2, ⋯, and xnrepresent the criteria with which the alternative performances are measured, where n represents the number of criteria. Moreover, denote X(={x1, x2, …, xn}) as a criterion set. In general, the criterion set X can be divided into two sets, Xband Xc, where Xbdenotes a collection of benefit criteria (i.e., larger values of xjindicate a greater preference); Xcdenotes a collection of cost criteria (i.e., smaller values of xjindicate a greater preference); and Xb∩Xc=∅, Xb∪Xc=X. Let wjbe the importance weight of every criterion xj∈X, which satisfies the normalization conditionswj≥0j=1,2,…,nand∑j=1nwj=1. Denote the vector of the weights byw=(w1,w2,…,wn).Numerous methods can be employed to determine the weights of the criteria, such as the eigenvector method, the weighted least-square method, the entropy method, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [12]. The selection of various weight-assessing methods depends on the nature of the problems [35]. For example, the AHP process developed by Saaty [32] can resolve qualitative and quantitative factors in the multiple criteria decision-making process [18]. Thus, the AHP process is a very useful decision analysis tool and can be used to determine the weight vector(w1,w2,…,wn)in this paper.Decision makers often make decisions in the context of linguistic interaction in the real world [17,33]. By using linguistic variables, decision makers achieve the flexibility of providing the appropriate evaluation values for the alternatives with respect to every criterion. Boran et al. [7], Li et al. [24,26,28], and Zhang and Liu [51] introduced a way to transform the linguistic variables into intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Yu et al. [48] proposed linguistic transformation standards for IVIFSs. Based on the linguistic variables and their corresponding intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, the decision makers can construct IVIFS ratings using linguistic terms to evaluate the alternatives with respect to every criterion according to their knowledge and experience.Let the IVIFNA˜ijkdenote the evaluation of alternative Ai∈A with respect to the criterion xj∈X provided by the decision maker Ek∈E. Then,A˜ijkcan be expressed as the following:(14)A˜ijk=(μijk,νijk)=([μijk−,μijk+],[νijk−,νijk+]),whereμijk(=[μijk−,μijk+])represents the interval of the membership degree for which alternative Aisatisfies criterion xjandνijk(=[νijk−,νijk+])indicates the interval of the non-membership degree for which alternative Aidoes not satisfy criterion xj, which is given by the decision maker Ek. For every Ai∈A, xj∈X, and Ek∈E, the hesitation interval ofA˜ijkis computed as follows:(15)πijk=[πijk−,πijk+]=[1−μijk+−νijk+,1−μijk−−νijk−],As motivated by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators introduced by Xu and Chen [42] and Xu et al. [46], this study proposed a modified interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid averaging (IIHA) operation to the aggregate IVIFN data that was provided by multiple decision makers for acquiring common ratings of the alternatives with respect to every criterion. The modified IIHA operation is composed of an inclusion comparison approach and an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IIOWA) operation.In this subsection, an inclusion-based approach is presented for fusing IVIFN data while considering the degrees of the relative agreement and the importance weights of multiple decision makers. Then, a collective decision matrix with common ratings can be constructed using the IIHA operation.Referring to the weight vector ϖ=(ϖ1, ϖ2, …, ϖK) of the K decision makers, the weighted IVIFN ratingA˜˙ijkfor every Ai∈A, xj∈X, and Ek∈E is computed as follows:(16)A˜˙ijk=Kϖk⋅A˜ijk=([1−(1−μijk−)Kϖk,1−(1−μijk+)Kϖk],[(νijk−)Kϖk,(νijk+)Kϖk]),where K is regarded as a balancing coefficient. If the weight vector (ϖ1, ϖ2, …, ϖK) approaches (1/K, 1/K, …, 1/K), then the vector(Kϖ1⋅A˜ij1,Kϖ2⋅A˜ij2,…,KϖK⋅A˜ijK)approaches(A˜ij1,A˜ij2,…,A˜ijK). Denoteμ˙ijk−=1−(1−μijk−)Kϖk,μ˙ijk+=1−(1−μijk+)Kϖk,ν˙ijk−=(νijk−)Kϖk, andν˙ijk+=(νijk+)Kϖkfor brevity. It follows that(17)A˜˙ijk=(μ˙ijk,ν˙ijk)=([μ˙ijk−,μ˙ijk+],[ν˙ijk−,ν˙ijk+]).Example 1Consider an MCGDM problem for selecting a suitable material supplier to provide the key components of the new products in a high-technology manufacturing company. A committee of three decision makers (E1, E2, and E3) has been formed to select the most suitable supplier, where ϖ=(0.5, 0.2, 0.3). Assume that the evaluations of a candidate supplier (Ai) with respect to technological capability (xj) are given by the following:A˜ij1=([0.5,0.7],[0.1,0.2]),A˜ij2=([0.5,0.6],[0.1,0.3]), andA˜ij3=([0.7,0.8],[0.0,0.1]). Applying (16), the weighted IVIFN ratings were obtained as follows:A˜˙ij1=([1−(1−0.5)3×0.5,1−(1−0.7)3×0.5],[0.13×0.5,0.23×0.5])=([0.65,0.84],[0.03,0.09]),A˜˙ij2=([0.34,0.42],[0.25,0.49]), andA˜˙ij3=([0.66,0.77],[0.00,0.13]).To make a comparison between the IVIFNs, this paper introduced the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision environment. The proposed inclusion comparison possibility originates from the possibility degree between the interval numbers [43,36], the likelihood measure between the closeness coefficient intervals [25], and the inclusion comparison probability between the closeness intuitionistic fuzzy sets [27]. LetA˜˙ijk=([μ˙ijk−,μ˙ijk+],[ν˙ijk−,ν˙ijk+])andA˜˙ijk'=([μ˙ijk'−,μ˙ijk'+],[ν˙ijk'−,ν˙ijk'+])be any two weighted IVIFN ratings defined on X, where0≤μ˙ijk++ν˙ijk+≤1and0≤μ˙ijk'++ν˙ijk'+≤1. The lower inclusion comparison possibilityp−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')ofA˜˙ijkandA˜˙ijk'is defined as follows:(18)p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=max1−max(1−ν˙ijk′−)−μ˙ijk−(1−μ˙ijk−−ν˙ijk+)+(1−μ˙ijk′+−ν˙ijk′−),0,0.The upper inclusion comparison possibilityp+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')ofA˜˙ijkandA˜˙ijk'is defined as(19)p+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=max1−max(1−ν˙ijk′+)−μ˙ijk+(1−μ˙ijk+−ν˙ijk−)+(1−μ˙ijk′−−ν˙ijk′+),0,0.The lower and upper inclusion comparison possibilities,p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')andp+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk'), respectively, satisfy the following properties:(20)(1)0≤p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')≤1;(21)(2)0≤p+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')≤1;(22)(3)p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')≤p+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk');(23)(4)p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')+p+(A˜˙ijk'⊇A˜˙ijk)=1.cExample 2Refer to the supplier selection problem in Example 1. The lower and upper inclusion comparison possibilities ofA˜˙ij1andA˜˙ij2were calculated using (18) and (19) as follows:p−(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij2)=max1−max(1−0.25)−0.65(1−0.65−0.09)+(1−0.42−0.25),0,0=0.83,p+(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij2)=max1−max(1−0.49)−0.84(1−0.84−0.03)+(1−0.34−0.49),0,0=1.00.Additionally,p−(A˜˙ij2⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.00,p+(A˜˙ij2⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.17,p−(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.29, andp+(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.91.The inclusion comparison possibilityp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')ofA˜˙ijkandA˜˙ijk′is defined as follows:(24)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=12(p−(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)+p+(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)).In other words,A˜˙ijkis not smaller thanA˜˙ijk′to the degree ofp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′). The inclusion comparison possibilityp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)satisfies the following properties:(25)(1)0≤p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)≤1;(26)(2)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=0if1−ν˙ijk−≤μ˙ijk′−;(27)(3)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=1ifμ˙ijk−≥1−ν˙ijk′−;(28)(4)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)+p(A˜˙ijk⊆A˜˙ijk′)=1;(5)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=p(A˜˙ijk⊆A˜˙ijk′)=0.5ifp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=p(A˜˙ijk⊆A˜˙ijk′);(6)p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)≥0.5ifp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk″)≥0.5andp(A˜˙ijk″⊇A˜˙ijk′)≥0.5.For every alternative Ai∈A with respect to criterion xj∈X, this paper computes the inclusion comparison possibilities of the pairwise weighted IVIFN ratings provided by any two decision makers. Referring to Theorem 2 in [27], the optimal degree of membership for the weighted IVIFN ratingA˜˙ijkis determined as follows:(29)p¯(A˜˙ijk)=1K(K−1)∑k'=1Kp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)+K2−1.Then, the ranking order of all weighted IVIFN ratings can be generated according to the descending order of thep¯(A˜˙ijk)values.Example 3Refer to Example 2. The following inclusion comparison possibilities were obtained using (24):p(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij2)=(1/2)×(0.83+1.00)=0.92,p(A˜˙ij2⊇A˜˙ij1)=0.08,p(A˜˙ij2⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.08,p(A˜˙ij3⊇A˜˙ij2)=0.92,p(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.60, andp(A˜˙ij3⊇A˜˙ij1)=0.40. As indicated previously,p(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=p(A˜˙ijk⊆A˜˙ijk′)=0.5ifp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk′)=p(A˜˙ijk⊆A˜˙ijk′). It follows thatp(A˜˙ij1⊇A˜˙ij1)=p(A˜˙ij2⊇A˜˙ij2)=p(A˜˙ij3⊇A˜˙ij3)=0.5. Next, applying (29), the optimal degree of membership forA˜˙ij1was computed as follows:p¯(A˜˙ij1)=13(3−1)0.5+0.92+0.6+32−1=0.42.Moreover,p¯(A˜˙ij2)=0.19andp¯(A˜˙ij3)=0.39.By extending the IIOWA operations, a modified IIHA operation on the IVIFS information was developed by weighting both the given IVIFN rating and its ordered position. This operation of hybrid averages can reflect the importance degrees of both decision makers and the agreement of the individual opinions. Let (σ(1), σ(2),…, σ(K)) denote a permutation of (1, 2,…, K) such thatp¯(A˜˙ijσ(k−1))≥p¯(A˜˙ijσ(k))for all k. The IIOWA weight vector τ=(τ1, τ2, …, τK) can be obtained according to the normal distribution-based method as developed by [40], where τk∈[0, 1] and∑k=1Kτk=1. Let uKbe the mean of the collection of 1, 2,…, K and vKbe the standard deviation of the collection of 1, 2,…, K. The IIOWA weight is defined as follows:(30)τk=e−((k−uK)2/2⋅vK2)∑k1=1Ke−((k1−uK)2/2⋅vK2),k=1,2,…,KExample 4Considering Example 3, it is known thatp¯(A˜˙ij1)≥p¯(A˜˙ij3)≥p¯(A˜˙ij2). Therefore, σ(1)=1, σ(2)=3, and σ(3)=2. Moreover,A˜˙ijσ(1)=A˜˙ij1,A˜˙ijσ(2)=A˜˙ij3, andA˜˙ijσ(3)=A˜˙ij2. For the collection of 1, 2, and 3, u3=2 and v3=0.8165. Applying (30), the IIOWA weights were determined as follows:τ1=e−((1−2)2/2×0.81652)e−((1−2)2/2×0.81652)+e−−((2−2)2/2×0.81652)+e−−((3−2)2/2×0.81652)=0.2429, τ2=0.5142, and τ3=0.2429. Then, the IIOWA weight vector τ=(0.2429, 0.5142, 0.2429).The IIHA operation on the K IVIFN ratings with the associated IIOWA weight vector τ is defined by(31)IIHAϖ,τ(A˜ij1,A˜ij2,…,A˜ijK)=IIOWAτ(A˜˙ij1,A˜˙ij2,…,A˜˙ijK)=IIOWAτ(Kϖ1⋅A˜ij1,Kϖ2⋅A˜ij2,…,KϖK⋅A˜ijK).The proposed IIHA operation can be used to obtain the group rating of the alternatives with respect to every criterion. It therefore follows that the evaluationA˜ijof the alternative Ai∈A with respect to criterion xj∈X can be calculated as the following:(32)A˜ij=1−∏k=1K(1−μ˙ijσ(k)−)τk,1−∏k=1K(1−μ˙ijσ(k)+)τk,∏k=1K(ν˙ijσ(k)−)τk,∏k=1K(ν˙ijσ(k)+)τk.Denoteμij−=1−∏k=1K(1−μ˙ijσ(k)−)τk,μij+=1−∏k=1K(1−μ˙ijσ(k)+)τk,νij−=∏k=1K(ν˙ijσ(k)−)τk, andνij+=∏k=1K(ν˙ijσ(k)+)τkfor brevity. Then,A˜ijcan be expressed as the following:(33)A˜ij=(μij,νij)=([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+]),whereμij(=[μij−,μij+])represents the interval of the membership degree for which alternative Aisatisfies criterion xjandνij(=[νij−,νij+])indicates the interval of the non-membership degree for which alternative Aidoes not satisfy criterion xj. For every Ai∈A and xj∈X, the hesitation interval ofA˜ijis computed as follows:(34)πij=[πij−,πij+]=[1−μij+−νij+,1−μij−−νij−].Example 5Refer to Example 4. It is known thatA˜˙ijσ(1)=A˜˙ij1=([0.65,0.84],[0.03,0.09]),A˜˙ijσ(2)=A˜˙ij3=([0.66,0.77],[0.00,0.13]), andA˜˙ijσ(3)=A˜˙ij2=([0.34,0.42],[0.25,0.49]). Applying (32), the evaluationA˜ijwas determined as follows:A˜ij=([1−(1−0.65)0.2429×(1−0.66)0.5142×(1−0.34)0.2429,1−(1−0.84)0.2429×(1−0.77)0.5142×(1−0.42)0.2429],[(0.03)0.2429×(0.00)0.5142×(0.25)0.2429,(0.09)0.2429×(0.13)0.5142×(0.49)0.2429])=([0.60,0.74],[0.00,0.16]).The characteristics of the alternative Aican be represented by the IVIFS in the following manner:(35)A˜i={〈x1,(μi1,νi1)〉,〈x2,(μi2,νi2)〉,…,〈xn,(μin,νin)〉}={〈xj,([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+])xj∈X,j=1,2,…,n〉},i=1,2,…,m.Thereby, a collective interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixD˜in the MCGDM problem can be concisely expressed as follows:(36)This section presents an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method with an approach that uses inclusion comparison possibilities for handling the MCGDM problem. Instead of the distance measures, the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities is adequately applied in the main structure of the TOPSIS method. A new index for an inclusion-based closeness coefficient is proposed under the considerations of positive- and negative-ideals. By coupling the given importance weights of the criteria, the weighted inclusion comparison possibility was identified to incorporate it into the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS model. The priority order of the alternatives can then be determined by comparing the inclusion-based closeness coefficients.The positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions are regarded as the points of reference in the TOPSIS method. DenoteA˜*as the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal solution concerning the MCGDM problem based on IVIFSs. Letμ*j=[μ*j−,μ*j+], and letν*j=[ν*j−,ν*j+]. According to the collective decision matrixD˜,A˜*is identified as follows:(37)A˜*={〈x1,(μ*1,ν*1)〉,〈x2,(μ*2,ν*2)〉,…,〈xn,(μ*n,ν*n)〉}={〈xj,([μ*j−,μ*j+],[ν*j−,ν*j+])〉xj∈X,j=1,2,…,n}.where(38)[μ*j−,μ*j+]=maxiμij−xj∈Xb,miniμij−xj∈Xc,maxiμij+xj∈Xb,miniμij+xj∈Xc,(39)[ν*j−,ν*j+]=miniνij−xj∈Xb,maxiνij−xj∈Xc,miniνij+xj∈Xb,maxiνij+xj∈Xc.The IVIFN evaluationA˜*jof the positive-ideal solution with respect to xjis given by(40)A˜*j=(μ*j,ν*j)=([μ*j−,μ*j+],[ν*j−,ν*j+])The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy negative-ideal solution, denoted asA˜−, is identified as follows:(41)A˜−=x1,(μ−1,ν−1),x2,(μ−2,ν−2),⋯,xn,(μ−n,ν−n)=xj,[μ−j−,μ−j+],[ν−j−,ν−j+]xj∈X,j=1,2,⋯,n,whereμ−j=[μ−j−,μ−j+]andν−j=[ν−j−,ν−j+]. Additionally,(42)[μ−j−,μ−j+]=miniμij−xj∈Xb,maxiμij−xj∈Xc,miniμij+xj∈Xb,maxiμij+xj∈Xc,(43)[ν−j−,ν−j+]=maxiνij−xj∈Xb,miniνij−xj∈Xc,maxiνij+xj∈Xb,miniνij+xj∈Xc.The IVIFN evaluationA˜−jof the negative-ideal solution in terms of xjis given by(44)A˜−j=(μ−j,ν−j)=[μ−j−,μ−j+],[ν−j−,ν−j+].Example 6Consider a multiple criteria decision-making problem with three alternatives (A1, A2, and A3) and two criteria (a benefit criterion x1 and a cost criterion x2). LetA˜11=([0.5,0.8],[0.1,0.1]),A˜21=([0.6,0.7],[0.1,0.2]),A˜31=([0.4,0.6],[0.0,0.3]),A˜12=([0.6,0.8],[0.0,0.1]),A˜22=([0.4,0.5],[0.2,0.5]), andA˜32=([0.2,0.3],[0.3,0.4])be the IVIFN evaluations. Applying (38) and (39), the IVIFN evaluationsA˜*1andA˜*2were obtained as follows:A˜*1=([max{0.5,0.6,0.4},max{0.8,0.7,0.6}],[min{0.1,0.1,0.0},min{0.1,0.2,0.3}])([0.6,0.8],[0.0,0.1]),A˜*2=([min{0.6,0.4,0.2},min{0.8,0.5,0.3}],[max{0.0,0.2,0.3},max{0.1,0.5,0.4}])([0.2,0.3],[0.3,0.5]).Accordingly,A˜*={〈x1,([0.6,0.8],[0.0,0.1])〉,〈x2,([0.2,0.3],[0.3,0.5])〉}. In a similar manner,A˜−1=([0.4,0.6],[0.1,0.3])andA˜−2=([0.6,0.8],[0.0,0.1])were acquired using (42) and (43). Then,A˜−={〈x1,([0.4,0.6],[0.1,0.3])〉,〈x2,([0.6,0.8],[0.0,0.1])〉}.To define an inclusion-based closeness coefficient, this paper first acquires the inclusion comparison possibility between the IVIFN evaluations of every alternative and the ideal solutions. For every Ai∈A and xj∈Xb, this paper calculates the inclusion comparison possibilityp(A˜*j⊇A˜ij)ofA˜ijnot being larger thanA˜*jand the possibilityp(A˜ij⊇A˜−j)ofA˜ijnot being smaller thanA˜−j. The alternative Aihas a good performance for the benefit criterion xj, if the IVIFN evaluationA˜ijhas a low possibility of being inferior toA˜*jand a high possibility of being superior toA˜−j. In contrast, this paper computesp(A˜ij⊇A˜*j)ofA˜ijnot being smaller thanA˜*jandp(A˜−j⊇A˜ij)ofA˜ijnot being larger thanA˜−jfor every Ai∈A and xj∈Xc. The alternative Aiperforms well for the cost criterion xjwhen the IVIFN evaluationA˜ijhas a low possibility of being farther fromA˜*jand a high possibility of being farther fromA˜−j. Combining the importance weights(w1,w2,…,wn)of the various criteria, the inclusion-based closeness coefficientCC(A˜i)of the characteristicsA˜ifor the alternative Aiis as follows:(45)CC(A˜i)=∑j=1np(A˜ij⊇A˜−jxj∈Xb),(A˜−j⊇A˜ijxj∈Xc)wj.∑j=1np(A˜*j⊇A˜ijxj∈Xb),(A˜ij⊇A˜*jxj∈Xc)wj+∑j=1np(A˜ij⊇A˜−jxj∈Xb),(A˜−j⊇A˜ijxj∈Xc)wj−1.It directly follows that(46)CC(A˜i)=∑j=1np(A˜ij⊇A˜−jxj∈Xb),(A˜−j⊇A˜ijxj∈Xc)wj⋅∑j=1np(A˜*j⊇A˜ij)+p(A˜ij⊇A˜−j)xj∈Xb,p(A˜ij⊇A˜*j)+p(A˜−j⊇A˜ij)xj∈Xcwj−1,where0≤CC(A˜i)≤1for every Ai∈A. The higher the inclusion-based closeness coefficientCC(A˜i), the better the characteristicsA˜i. Thus, the m alternatives can be ranked according to the decreasing order ofCC(A˜i)for all Ai∈A. This paper chooses the best alternative with the maximum value among all of theCC(A˜i)values.Based on the concept of inclusion comparison possibilities, the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method within the IVIFS decision environment for solving MCGDM problems can be summarized in the following steps:Step 1: Formulate an MCGDM problem. Form a committee of decision makers(E=E1,E2,…,EK)and identify their normalized importance weights (ϖ=(ϖ1, ϖ2, …, ϖK)). Specify the evaluation criteria (X={x1, x2, …, xn}) with normalized weightsw=(w1,w2,…,wn), and generate non-dominated alternatives (A={A1, A2, ⋯, Am}).Step 2: Select the appropriate linguistic variables or the other data collection tools to establish the IVIFN evaluationA˜ijkof alternative Ai∈A with respect to criterion xj∈X, which is provided by the decision maker Ek∈E.Step 3: Obtain the weighted IVIFN ratingA˜˙ijkof the individual IVIFN data by multiplying the weight vector ϖ=(ϖ1, ϖ2, …, ϖK).Step 4: Compute the inclusion comparison possibilityp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')of pairwise weighted IVIFN ratingsA˜˙ijkandA˜˙ijk′for every Ai∈A and xj∈X.Step 5: Determine the optimal degree of membershipp¯(A˜˙ijk)forA˜˙ijk. Derive the IIOWA weight vector τ=(τ1, τ2, …, τK) according to the descending order of thep¯(A˜˙ijk)values for all k.Step 6: Apply the inclusion-based IIHA operations to obtain the IVIFN evaluationA˜ijfor every Ai∈A and xj∈X. Construct the collective interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixD˜.Step 7: Identify the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutionsA˜*andA˜−, respectively and the corresponding IVIFN evaluationsA˜*jandA˜−jwith respect to each xj.Step 8: Calculate the inclusion comparison possibilitiesp(A˜*j⊇A˜ij),p(A˜ij⊇A˜−j)(for every Ai∈A and xj∈Xb),p(A˜ij⊇A˜*j), andp(A˜−j⊇A˜ij)(for every Ai∈A and xj∈Xc) to determine the inclusion-based closeness coefficientCC(A˜i)ofA˜i.Step 9: Rank the m alternatives in accordance with theCC(A˜i)values. The alternative with the largestCC(A˜i)value is the best choice.The proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method was originally developed for the weight vector of the criteria given a priori. However, the proposed method is also appropriate for handling MCGDM problems with unknown or partially known preference information. The multiple decision makers may not be willing or able to specify their preference structures in the detailed manner as required by the theoretical methodology or may not provide exact estimations of the required decision parameters. Therefore, in the following sections, this paper will discuss the situations where the information about the criterion weights is completely unknown or incompletely known.Consider a situation in which the decision makers’ preference information about the criterion importance is completely unknown in the discussed MCGDM problem. Let Γ0 denote a set of all weight vectors, and(47)Γ0=(w1,w2,⋯,wn)wj≥0(j=1,2,…,n),∑j=1nwj=1.The optimal weight values of the criteria can be determined via the following multiple objective nonlinear programming model:(48)[M1]max{CC(A˜1),CC(A˜2),…,CC(A˜m)}s.t.(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0.By utilizing Zimmermann and Zysno's [53] max–min operator, the model in [M1] can be converted into the following single-objective nonlinear programming model:(49)[M2]maxϑs.t.CC(A˜i)≥ϑfori=1,2,…,m,(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0..The optimal weight vectorw¯=(w¯1,w¯2,…,w¯n)can be determined by solving the above model.Consider another situation in which the decision makers provide incomplete (i.e., imprecise or partial) preference information about the criterion importance in the MCGDM problem. The incomplete information for the criterion weights can be generally constructed by using five basic ranking forms [9,27,31,38], including a weak ranking, a strict ranking, a ranking of differences (i.e., strength of preference), an interval bound, and a ratio bound (i.e., a ranking with multiples). The decision makers can provide their preferences over the criteria by some of the five basic ranking forms. However, the multiple decision makers may provide different and even conflicting preferences regarding the criterion weights, which imply that some ranking conditions do not simultaneously hold because of the inconsistent information given by the different decision makers. Accordingly, some deviation variables must be incorporated into the model to relax the ranking constraints of the criterion weights to address problems with inconsistent information.In regard to an MCGDM problem with incomplete weight information, by introducing several non-negative deviation variablese(i)j1j2−,e(ii)j1j2−,e(iii)j1j2j3−,e(iv)j1−,e(iv)j1+, ande(v)j1j2−for j1≠j2≠j3, this paper considered the five relaxed ranking forms [9,10] of incomplete information about the criterion weights:(i) A relaxed weak ranking:(50)Γ1=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1+e(i)j1j2−≥wj2forallj1∈ϒ1andj2∈Λ1,where ϒ1 and Λ1 are two disjoint subsets of the subscript index set N={1, 2, …, n} of all of the criteria.(ii) A relaxed strict ranking:(51)Γ2=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1−wj2+e(ii)j1j2−≥δ′j1j2for allj1∈ϒ2andj2∈Λ2,whereδ′j1j2is a constant that satisfies the conditionδ′j1j2>0, and ϒ2 and Λ2 are two disjoint subsets of N.(iii) A relaxed ranking of differences:(52)Γ3=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1−2wj2+wj3+e(iii)j1j2j3−≥0forallj1∈ϒ3,j2∈Λ3,andj3∈Ω3,where ϒ3, Λ3, and Ω3 are three disjoint subsets of N.(iv) A relaxed interval bound:(53)Γ4=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1+e(iv)j1−≥δj1,wj1−e(iv)j1+≤δj1+εj1forallj1∈ϒ4,whereδj1≥0andεj1≥0are constants that satisfy the condition0≤δj1≤δj1+εj1≤1, and ϒ4 is a subset of N.(v) A relaxed ratio bound:(54)Γ5=(w1,w2,⋯,wn)∈Γ0wj1wj2+e(v)j1j2−≥δ″j1j2for allj1∈ϒ5andj2∈Λ5,whereδ″j1j2is a constant that satisfies the condition0≤δ″j1j2≤1, and ϒ5 and Λ5 are two disjoint subsets of N.Let Γ denote a set of the relaxed information about the criterion weights, which consists of the preceding five sets Γ1, Γ2, …, and Γ5. In other words,(55)Γ=Γ1∪Γ2∪Γ3∪Γ4∪Γ5=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1+e(i)j1j2−≥wj2forallj1∈ϒ1andj2∈Λ1;wj1−wj2+e(ii)j1j2−≥δ′j1j2for allj1∈ϒ2andj2∈Λ2;wj1−2wj2+wj3+e(iii)j1j2j3−≥0forallj1∈ϒ3,j2∈Λ3,andj3∈Ω3;wj1+e(iv)j1−≥δj1,wj1−e(iv)j1+≤δj1+εj1forallj1∈ϒ4;wj1wj2+e(v)j1j2−≥δ″j1j2forallj1∈ϒ5andj2∈Λ5.Regarding the MCGDM problem with incomplete preference information, this paper constructed the following multiple objective nonlinear programming model to solve for the optimal weight values of the criteria:(56)maxCC(A˜1),CC(A˜2),…,CC(A˜m)min∑j1,j2,j3∈Ne(i)j1j2−+e(ii)j1j2−+e(iii)j1j2j3−+e(iv)j1−+e(iv)j1++e(v)j1j2−M3(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γe(i)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ1andj2∈Λ1,e(ii)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ2andj2∈Λ2,e(iii)j1j2j3−≥0j1∈ϒ3,j2∈Λ3,andj3∈Ω3,e(iv)j1−≥0,e(iv)j1+≥0j1∈ϒ4,e(v)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ5andj2∈Λ5.The above model can be integrated into the following single-objective nonlinear programming model:(57)maxϑM4s.t.CC(A˜i)≥ϑfori=1,2,…,m,−∑j1,j2,j3∈N(e(i)j1j2−+e(ii)j1j2−+e(iii)j1j2j3−+e(iv)j1−+e(iv)j1++e(v)j1j2−)≥ϑ,w1,w2,…,wn∈Γ,e(i)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ1andj2∈Λ1,e(ii)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ2andj2∈Λ2,e(iii)j1j2j3−≥0j1∈ϒ3,j2∈Λ3,andj3∈Ω3,e(iv)j1−≥0,e(iv)j1+≥0j1∈ϒ4,e(v)j1j2−≥0j1∈ϒ5andj2∈Λ5.By solving the integrated nonlinear programming model [M4], this approach can obtain the optimal weight vectorw¯=(w¯1,w¯2,⋯,w¯n)and the optimal deviation valuese¯(i)j1j2−,e¯(ii)j1j2−,e¯(iii)j1j2j3−,e¯(iv)j1−,e¯(iv)j1+, ande¯(v)j1j2−(j1, j2, j3∈N). Next, the corresponding inclusion-based closeness coefficientCC¯(A˜i)of the alternative Aican also be obtained. The next step is to choose the maximum value among all of theCC¯(A˜i)values and obtain the optimal ranking order of the alternatives.In this section, a medical MCGDM problem adapted from [13] is used as an illustration for applying the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision environment in practice. The studied case was from the Department of Neurology at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. This application involves a medical decision-making problem concerning basilar artery occlusion.The patient was an 82-year-old widowed male with a history of hypertension. He had two sons and one daughter, who were all married with children. Because of his complaints regarding physical discomfort, the patient was brought to the hospital by his family. The attending physician made a diagnosis of basilar artery occlusion. Basilar artery occlusion is an acute cerebrovascular disease caused by a complete or partial occlusion of the basilar artery. It is characterized by a gradual disturbance in consciousness, rapid progression, and a critical and poor prognosis. The physician assessed the patient's medical history and his current physical conditions and provided the following treatment options: intravenous thrombolysis, intra-arterial thrombolysis, antiplatelet treatment, and heparinization. Each treatment had advantages and disadvantages. Because the patient was unconscious, the physician explained the diagnosis to his family members. He described the four treatment methods using the following five criteria: survival rate, severity of the complications, probability of a cure, expense, and probability of a recurrence, which are summarized in Table 1.As stated earlier, the decision makers can use linguistic variables to describe their ratings of the alternatives with respect to the various criteria for the sake of convenience. This study proposed a five-point rating scale, which originates from [23] and [24], to measure the IVIFN ratings of the alternative evaluations based on various criteria. Table 2indicates five translations of the linguistic terms into IVIFNs. Each of the five-point interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic terms corresponds to the set of five member intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic terms developed by Li [23] and Li [24].Using the inclusion-based TOPSIS method that is based on IVIFSs, the medical group decision-making problem of basilar artery occlusion was solved according to the proposed algorithm as follows.Step 1: The patient's three children, his older son, younger son, and daughter, are the three decision makers, E1, E2, and E3, respectively, and have a weight vector of ϖ=(0.40, 0.35, 0.25). DenoteE=E1,E2,E3. Five criteria were used, including the survival rate (x1), the severity of the complications (x2), the probability of a cure (x3), the expense (x4), and the probability of a recurrence (x5). The set of evaluative criteria is denoted by X={x1, x2, …, x5}, with Xb={x1, x3} and Xc={x2, x4, x5}. The AHP process is a well-known and widely used method for assessing the weight vector. Thus, this study applied the AHP approach to determine the weights of the criteria. The weight vector is w=(0.23, 0.12, 0.28, 0.15, 0.22). There are four treatment options, including intravenous thrombolysis (A1), intra-arterial thrombolysis (A2), antiplatelet treatment (A3), and heparinization (A4). The set of treatment methods is denoted by A={A1, A2, A3, A4}.Step 2: Applying the five-point linguistic scales, the three decision makers evaluated the four treatment methods based on the five criteria. The obtained linguistic ratings are presented in Table 3. According to the method for transforming linguistic variables to IVIFNs, the linguistic ratings were converted into the IVIFN evaluationsA˜ijkfor all Ai∈A, xj∈X, and Ek∈E as shown in Table 4.Step 3: Incorporating the weight vector ϖ=(0.40, 0.35, 0.25) into the IVIFN evaluationsA˜ijk, the weighted IVIFN ratingA˜˙ijkwas acquired for all Ai∈A, xj∈X, and Ek∈E, as indicated in Table 4. ConsiderA˜˙132, for example.A˜˙132=3ϖ2⋅A˜132=([1−(1−0.30)3×0.35,1−(1−0.50)3×0.35],[(0.2)3×0.35,(0.4)3×0.35])=([0.3124,0.5170],[0.1845,0.3821]).Step 4: For every Ai∈A and xj∈X, this study calculated the inclusion comparison possibilityp(A˜˙ijk⊇A˜˙ijk')of pairwiseA˜˙ijkandA˜˙ijk'. Consider a case of alternative A1 with respect to criterion x3, for example.p(A˜˙131⊇A˜˙132)=12(p−(A˜˙131⊇A˜˙132)+p+(A˜˙131⊇A˜˙132))=12max1−max(1−0.1845)−0.3482(1−0.3482−0.3330)+(1−0.5170−0.1845),0,0+max1−max(1−0.3821)−0.5647(1−0.5647−0.1450)+(1−0.3124−0.3821),0,0=0.5768.Additionally,p(A˜˙131⊇A˜˙133)=0.4816,p(A˜˙132⊇A˜˙133)=0.3993,p(A˜˙132⊇A˜˙131)=0.4232,p(A˜˙133⊇A˜˙131)=0.5184, andp(A˜˙133⊇A˜˙132)=0.6007.Step 5: The optimal degree of membershipp¯(A˜˙ijk)was computed for allA˜˙ijk. ConsiderA˜˙13k, for example, as follows:p¯(A˜˙131)=13(3−1)∑k′=13p(A˜˙131⊇A˜˙13k′)+32−1=13(3−1)0.5+0.5768+0.4816+32−1=0.3431,p¯(A˜˙132)=0.3037, andp¯(A˜˙133)=0.3532. Becausep¯(A˜˙133)≥p¯(A˜˙131)≥p¯(A˜˙132), σ(1)=3, σ(2)=1, and σ(3)=2. Additionally,A˜˙13σ(1)=A˜˙133,A˜˙13σ(2)=A˜˙131, andA˜˙13σ(3)=A˜˙132with the associated IIOWA weight vector τ=(0.2429, 0.5142, 0.2429) according to the normal distribution-based method.Step 6: The evaluationA˜ijwas determined for every Ai∈A and xj∈X using the inclusion-based IIHA operation. ConsiderA˜13, for example.A˜13=IIHAϖ,τ(A˜131,A˜132,A˜133)=IIOWAτ(A˜˙131,A˜˙132,A˜˙133)=1−1−0.40540.2429×1−0.34820.5142×1−0.31240.2429,1−1−0.59460.2429×1−0.56470.5142×1−0.51700.2429,0.10570.2429×0.14500.5142×0.18450.2429,0.35360.2429×0.33300.5142×0.38210.2429=([0.3542,0.5612],[0.1424,0.3494]).Thereby, the collective interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixD˜was constructed as follows:where the IVIFN evaluationA˜ijof alternative Ai∈A on xj∈X is shown in Table 5.Step 7: According to the IVIFN evaluationsA˜ijin Table 5, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal solutionA˜*was identified as follows:A˜*=x1,([0.7216,0.9335],[0.0000,0.0644]),x2,([0.1039,0.2612],[0.4669,0.6796]),x3,([0.6722,0.9032],[0.0000,0.0924]),x4,([0.0148,0.1139],[0.6638,0.8685]),x5,([0.0148,0.1139],[0.6638,0.8685]).Additionally, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy negative-ideal solutionA˜−is in the following:A˜−=x1,([0.2248,0.4188],[0.2818,0.4909]),x2,([0.3699,0.5773],[0.1287,0.3376]),x3,([0.0093,0.0926],[0.6858,0.8961]),x4,([0.7216,0.9335],[0.0000,0.0644]),x5,([0.6722,0.9032],[0.0000,0.0924]).Step 8: For every Ai∈A,p(A˜*j⊇A˜ij)andp(A˜ij⊇A˜−j)were calculated for the benefit criteria (xj∈{x1, x3}), andp(A˜ij⊇A˜*j)andp(A˜−j⊇A˜ij)were calculated for the cost criteria (xj∈{x2, x4, x5}). These computational results are presented in Table 6. Then, combining the weight vector w=(0.23, 0.12, 0.28, 0.15, 0.22), the inclusion-based closeness coefficientCC(A˜i)ofA˜iwas calculated as follows:CC(A˜1)=1.0000×0.23+0.6646×0.12+1.0000×0.28+0.9543×0.15+0.9570×0.22⋅(0.5000+1.0000)×0.23+(0.7639+0.6646)×0.12+(0.8257+1.0000)×0.28+(0.9303+0.9543)×0.15+(0.8901+0.9570)×0.22−1=0.5496,CC(A˜2)=0.5602,CC(A˜3)=0.4122, andCC(A˜4)=0.4523.Step 9: The four treatment methods are ranked according to the increasing order of theirCC(A˜i)values. The resulting ranking order is A2≻A1≻A4≻A3. Therefore, the best treatment option is intra-arterial thrombolysis (A2).Finally, the patient's family decided to adopt intra-arterial thrombolysis as the treatment. The patient became conscious after the treatment and is still undergoing rehabilitation.If the importance weights of the criteria are completely unknown a priori, then the model in [M2] can be used to solve for the optimal criterion weights. LetΓ0=(w1,w2,⋯,w5)wj≥0(j=1,2,⋯,5),∑j=15wj=1. Applying [M2], the following nonlinear programming model was constructed:(58)maxϑs.t.1.0000w1+0.6646w2+1.0000w3+0.9543w4+0.9570w51.5000w1+1.4285w2+1.8257w3+1.8846w4+1.8471w5≥ϑ,0.8706w1+0.5000w2+1.0000w3+0.5000w4+1.0000w51.5366w1+1.3554w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,0.5000w1+0.8050w2+0.5000w3+1.0000w4+0.5161w51.5000w1+1.4071w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5161w5≥ϑ,0.7366w1+0.8554w2+0.8104w3+0.8779w4+0.5000w51.5500w1+1.3555w2+1.8104w3+1.8756w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,w1+w2+w3+w4+w5=1,wj≥0forallj.The above model was solved using the Global Solver of LINGO 12.0 to derive the optimal solutions. The optimal objective value is 0.4930646, and the optimal weight vectorw¯=(0.4437980×106,0.2670992,0.4411065,0.2917938,0). Additionally, the corresponding inclusion-based closeness coefficients are obtained as follows:CC¯(A˜1)=0.5165147,CC¯(A˜2)=0.4930646,CC¯(A˜3)=0.4930646, andCC¯(A˜4)=0.4930646. Thus, the optimal order of the four treatment methods is the following: A1≻A2∼A3∼A4. The best choice is intravenous thrombolysis (A1), which is different from the computational result earlier. It is seen that the optimal weights are substantially different among the five criteria, especially the values ofw¯1andw¯5, which are only 0.4437980×10−6 and 0, respectively. Furthermore, the priority orders of A2, A3, and A4 cannot be differentiated. The resulting ranking orders of the alternatives are markedly unreasonable in the case of completely unknown information about the criterion weights a priori, which implies that a reasonable solution result might be difficult to obtain when using the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method under a scenario with completely unknown preference information. Accordingly, this paper discusses the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed method when the importance weights of the criteria are incompletely known a priori.This paper pre-designated a set of incomplete preference information in accordance with the weight vector w=(0.23, 0.12, 0.28, 0.15, 0.22), which was used in the original case. Assume that the three decision makers provided the preference relationships over the five criteria as follows:w1≥w4,w5−w2≥0.04,w3−w2≥w2−w4,0.08≤w4≤0.15, andw2≥0.4⋅w3. Note that only partial information for the criterion importance is provided. Thus, in general, one cannot solve for the same weight values of the criteria according to this limited preference information.By introducing several deviation variables (e(i)14−,e(ii)52−,e(iii)324−,e(iv)4−,e(iv)4+, ande(v)23−), the model in [M4] was used to establish the following integrated nonlinear programming model:(59)maxϑs.t.1.0000w1+0.6646w2+1.0000w3+0.9543w4+0.9570w51.5000w1+1.4285w2+1.8257w3+1.8846w4+1.8471w5≥ϑ,0.8706w1+0.5000w2+1.0000w3+0.5000w4+1.0000w51.5366w1+1.3554w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,0.5000w1+0.8050w2+0.5000w3+1.0000w4+0.5161w51.5000w1+1.4071w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5161w5≥ϑ,0.7366w1+0.8554w2+0.8104w3+0.8779w4+0.5000w51.5500w1+1.3555w2+1.8104w3+1.8756w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,−e(i)14−+e(ii)52−+e(iii)324−+e(iv)4−+e(iv)4++e(v)23−≥ϑ,w1+e(i)14−≥w4,w5−w2+e(ii)52−≥0.04,w3−2w2+w4+e(iii)324−≥0,w4+e(iv)4−≥0.08,w4−e(iv)4+≤0.15,w2w3+e(v)23−≥0.4,e(i)14−≥0,e(ii)52−≥0,e(iii)324−≥0,e(iv)4−≥0,e(iv)4+≥0,e(v)23−≥0,w1+w2+w3+w4+w5=1,wj≥0forallj.The optimal objective value is 0. Additionally, the optimal weight vectorw¯=(0.2759844,0.1056329,0.2031062,0.1440145,0.2712621), and for the optimal deviation values,e(i)14−=e(ii)52−=e(iii)324−=e(iv)4−=e(iv)4+=e(v)23−=0. The corresponding closeness coefficients are as follows:CC¯(A˜1)=0.5540084,CC¯(A˜2)=0.5615795,CC¯(A˜3)=0.4072068, andCC¯(A˜4)=0.4458253. Thus, the optimal order of the four treatment methods is the following: A2≻A1≻A4≻A3, which is the same as that obtained from the situation in which the weight vector is given a priori. The proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method that is based on IVIFSs is a useful compromising decision-making method because of its flexibility with regard to complete and incomplete preference information.In this subsection, a comparative study with an intuitionistic fuzzy approach was conducted to further explain the practical meaning of the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method based on IVIFSs and to clarify the advantage of using IVIFSs instead of ordinary intuitionistic fuzzy sets.To compare the obtained results for the two approaches using IVIFSs and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, the IVIFN evaluations in the medical MCGDM problem were converted into intuitionistic fuzzy evaluations to facilitate a comparative analysis. Recall that the IVIFN evaluation of alternative Aiwith respect to criterion xjprovided by the decision maker Ekis expressed asA˜ijk=(μijk,νijk)=([μijk−,μijk+],[νijk−,νijk+]). The corresponding intuitionistic fuzzy evaluationA¯ijkis defined as follows:(60)A¯ijk=(μ¯ijk,ν¯ijk)=μijk−+μijk+2,νijk−+νijk+2.whereμ¯ijk(=(μijk−+μijk+)/2)represents the degree of membership for which alternative Aisatisfies criterion xj, andν¯ijk(=(νijk−+νijk+)/2)indicates the degree of non-membership for which alternative Aidoes not satisfy criterion xj, which is given by the decision maker Ek. The collective decision matrix was determined using the inclusion-based hybrid averaging method. Moreover, the intuitionistic fuzzy evaluationA¯ijof alternative Ai∈A on xj∈X is shown in Table 7.The intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal solutionA¯*was identified as follows:A¯*=x1,(0.8252,0.0330),x2,(0.1815,0.5761),x3,(0.7809,0.0507),x4,(0.0635,0.7662),x5,(0.0635,0.7662).Moreover, the intuitionistic fuzzy negative-ideal solutionA¯−is in the following:A¯−=x1,(0.3211,0.3885),x2,(0.4737,0.2355),x3,(0.0504,0.7907),x4,(0.8252,0.0330),x5,(0.7809,0.0507).In the intuitionistic fuzzy settings, Table 8depicts the computation results of the inclusion comparison possibilities for every alternative Ai∈A, includingp(A¯*j⊇A¯ij)andp(A¯ij⊇A¯−j)with respect to every benefit criterion xj∈{x1, x3} andp(A¯ij⊇A¯*j)andp(A¯−j⊇A¯ij)with respect to every cost criterion xj∈{x2, x4, x5}. Then, the following inclusion-based closeness coefficients were derived:CC(A¯1)=0.5243,CC(A¯2)=0.5524,CC(A¯3)=0.4209, andCC(A¯4)=0.4757. Accordingly, the resulting ranking order is A2≻A1≻A4≻A3. This ranking result for the four alternatives is the same as that obtained using the inclusion-based TOPSIS method based on IVIFSs.Compared to the proposed method using IVIFSs, the approach using ordinary intuitionistic fuzzy sets loses much useful information even though the identical ranking result was obtained. As revealed in Table 8, most of the inclusion comparison possibilities in the intuitionistic fuzzy settings are equal to 1. ConsiderA¯13(=(0.4580, 0.2477)),A¯14(=(0.3651, 0.3349)), andA¯15(=(0.3211, 0.3885)) for example. The obtained inclusion comparison possibilities arep(A¯*3⊇A¯13)=p(A¯14⊇A¯*4)=p(A¯15⊇A¯*5)=1. This implies thatA¯*3is not smaller thanA¯13to the degree of 1. Additionally,A¯14is not smaller thanA¯*4to the degree of 1, andA¯15is not smaller thanA¯*5to the degree of 1. Nevertheless,p(A¯*3⊇A¯13),p(A¯14⊇A¯*4), andp(A¯15⊇A¯*5)cannot be effectively differentiated via the approach using intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Consequently, these results are less reasonable. Because most of the inclusion comparison possibilities in Table 8 are equal to 1, the relationship between the intuitionistic fuzzy evaluation and the positive-ideal solution cannot be precisely captured in the intuitionistic fuzzy framework. By contrast, the inclusion comparison possibilities yielded by the proposed method are reliable and reasonable. As indicated in Table 6,p(A˜*3⊇A˜13)=0.8257,p(A˜14⊇A˜*4)=0.9303, andp(A˜15⊇A˜*5)=0.8901. Obviously, the approach using IVIFSs can precisely measure the relationship between the IVIFN evaluation and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal solution as well as the relationship between the IVIFN evaluation and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy negative-ideal solution. Therefore, the proposed method based on IVIFSs performs better than the approach using ordinary intuitionistic fuzzy sets.Consider the situation that the weights of the criteria are completely unknown a priori. The following nonlinear programming model was constructed in the intuitionistic fuzzy settings:(61)maxϑs.t.1.0000w1+0.6760w2+1.0000w3+1.0000w4+1.0000w51.5000w1+1.5676w2+2.0000w3+2.0000w4+2.0000w5≥ϑ,1.0000w1+0.5000w2+1.0000w3+0.5000w4+1.0000w51.7870w1+1.5000w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,0.5000w1+0.9790w2+0.5000w3+1.0000w4+0.5167w51.5000w1+1.5653w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5167w5≥ϑ,0.8386w1+1.0000w2+1.0000w3+1.0000w4+0.5000w51.8386w1+1.5000w2+2.0000w3+2.0000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,w1+w2+w3+w4+w5=1,wj≥0forallj.The optimal weight vectorw¯=(0,0,0.5,0.5,0)and the corresponding inclusion-based closeness coefficients are as follows:CC¯(A¯1)=CC¯(A¯2)=CC¯(A¯3)=CC¯(A¯4)=0.5. It follows that the ranking order of the alternatives is A1∼A2∼A3∼A4. Note that this ranking result is evidently irrational and valueless. The priority orders of the four alternatives cannot be differentiated via the approach that uses ordinary intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Furthermore, the optimal weight vector is undesirable and unrealistic because the optimal weights of x1 (survival rate), x2 (severity of the complications), and x5 (probability of a recurrence) are equal to 0. It is impossible to persuade the three decision makers to accept these results. Therefore, the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method that is based on IVIFSs can obtain more practical and reasonable results than the approach using intuitionistic fuzzy sets.Next, considering the case of partial information of the criterion importance, the following integrated nonlinear programming model was established in the intuitionistic fuzzy settings:(62)maxϑs.t.1.0000w1+0.6760w2+1.0000w3+1.0000w4+1.0000w51.5000w1+1.5676w2+2.0000w3+2.0000w4+2.0000w5≥ϑ,1.0000w1+0.5000w2+1.0000w3+0.5000w4+1.0000w51.7870w1+1.5000w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,0.5000w1+0.9790w2+0.5000w3+1.0000w4+0.5167w51.5000w1+1.5653w2+1.5000w3+1.5000w4+1.5167w5≥ϑ,0.8386w1+1.0000w2+1.0000w3+1.0000w4+0.5000w51.8386w1+1.5000w2+2.0000w3+2.0000w4+1.5000w5≥ϑ,−e(i)14−+e(ii)52−+e(iii)324−+e(iv)4−+e(iv)4++e(v)23−≥ϑ,w1+e(i)14−≥w4,w5−w2+e(ii)52−≥0.04,w3−2w2+w4+e(iii)324−≥0,w4+e(iv)4−≥0.08,w4−e(iv)4+≤0.15,w2w3+e(v)23−≥0.4,e(i)14−≥0,e(ii)52−≥0,e(iii)324−≥0,e(iv)4−≥0,e(iv)4+≥0,e(v)23−≥0,w1+w2+w3+w4+w5=1,wj≥0forallj.The optimal weight vectorw¯=(0.2759844,0.1056329,0.2031062,0.1440145,0.2712621)and the corresponding closeness coefficients are as follows:CC¯(A¯1)=0.5317171,CC¯(A¯2)=0.5541870,CC¯(A¯3)=0.4149291, andCC¯(A¯4)=0.4639621. The optimal order of the four alternatives is the following: A2≻A1≻A4≻A3, which is the same as that obtained from the proposed method based on IVIFSs. However, the coefficients of the constraints in (62) are less reasonable than those in (59) despite the identical ranking results.On the whole, the employment of the proposed inclusion-based TOPSIS method based on IVIFSs yields more reasonable and credible results than the approach that uses intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Furthermore, the theory of IVIFSs is helpful for addressing the uncertainty of multiple criteria evaluations and for quantifying the ambiguous nature of the subjective assessments in a convenient way. As shown in the comparative study, more useful and practical information was contained in the solution result using the proposed method with IVIFSs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper developed the inclusion-based TOPSIS method for managing MCGDM problems in the IVIFS framework. The concept of inclusion comparison possibilities between IVIFNs has some useful and important properties. Thus, it is valuable for comparing IVIFN ratings and is applied to perform decision analysis within the IVIFS environment. Overall, this paper makes several significant contributions to the existing literature on compromising decision-making models for MCGDM problems based on IVIFSs. First, this paper employed inclusion comparison possibilities to develop the modified IIHA operation based on the inclusion-based IIOWA operation. Second, this paper pooled multiple decision makers’ subjective judgments to construct the collective decision matrix with aggregated IVIFN ratings by using the inclusion-based hybrid averaging method. Third, a new comparative index of inclusion-based closeness coefficients was established by using the weighted inclusion comparison possibilities instead of distance measures. Then, an extended inclusion-based TOPSIS method was developed to determine the priority order of the alternatives. Fourth, the cases of unknown criterion weights including completely unknown and incompletely known preference information were discussed. Two optimization models were then propounded to determine the optimal weight values of the criteria. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the inclusion-based TOPSIS model were validated using a real-world medical problem with alternative treatment methods. In summary, this paper proposed a useful compromising method within the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment by extending traditional TOPSIS techniques and by incorporating an inclusion comparison approach into the new model. The developed inclusion-based TOPSIS method is recommended for handling MCGDM problems in the IVIFS context and has the potential for use in practical applications.
