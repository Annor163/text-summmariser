@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A connected dominating set (CDS) is commonly used to model a virtual backbone of a wireless network. To bound the distance that information must travel through the network, we explicitly restrict the diameter of a CDS to be no more than s leading to the concept of a dominating s-club. We prove that for any fixed positive integer s it is NP-complete to determine if a graph has a dominating s-club, even when the graph has diameters+1. As a special case it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter two has a dominating clique. We then propose a compact integer programming formulation for the related minimization problem, enhance the approach with variable fixing rules and valid inequalities, and present computational results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is common to represent a wireless communication network as a graph, where nodes in the wireless network correspond to vertices in the graph and edges denote the ability to communicate directly. Any given pair of nodes may not be close enough to communicate directly, but a message can be transmitted through intermediate nodes. In the wireless network, these intermediate nodes form a virtual backbone structure, which is a connected dominating set (CDS) in the graph setting. It may be important to transmit these messages quickly. This requirement of low-latency can be enforced in the graph by requiring that the vertices from the CDS induce a subgraph of small diameter. This leads to the notion of a dominating s-club—a dominating set whose induced subgraph has diameter at most s. It can be seen that dominating s-club generalizes dominating clique (lets=1), and if we allow s to be instance-dependent it generalizes CDS (lets=n-1for an n-vertex graph).A dominating clique (i.e., a dominating 1-club) introduced by Brandstädt and Kratsch (1985) (see also Brandstädt & Kratsch, 1987; Cozzens & Kelleher, 1990) can provide a virtual backbone structure for a wireless communication network that has the shortest communication time. Since the members of the dominating clique can communicate directly, a message departing from any source can reach any destination in at most 3 hops. On the other hand, ensuring the existence of a dominating clique in a wireless network may be too costly. Moreover, this may result in excessive interference.A dominating s-club provides a compromise, possibly offering advantages over the commonly used CDS in terms of speed of communication, energy consumption, and reliability (Kim, Wu, Li, Zou, & Du, 2009). Small diameter dominating sets facilitate quick communication between each pair of vertices, as any two vertices are at mosts+2hops apart: 1 hop to reach the backbone, s hops within the backbone, and 1 hop to the destination. All else being equal, smaller dominating sets contribute to improved energy consumption, as the number of transmissions required to pass a message from one vertex to another is small. Also recognize that long transmission paths can increase the chance of message transmission failure (Mohammed, Gewali, & Muthukumar, 2005), meaning that a smaller-diameter backbone may be more reliable. In contrast to a dominating s-club, a CDS D ensures little in terms of the diameter (the worst case diameter is|D|-1), possibly resulting in excessively long transmission paths between vertices.The minimum dominating s-club problem, which is the focus of the present paper, is defined as follows. Given a graphG=(V,E)and a positive integer constant s, find a smallest dominating setD⊆Vsuch thatdiam(G[D])⩽s, or decide that none exist. When a dominating s-club exists in G, we call the size of a minimum dominating s-club the dominating s-club number of G and denote it byγclubs(G).We consider a simple undirected graphG=(V,E)with set V of n vertices and setE⊂V×Vof edges. We denote the (open) neighborhood of a vertexi∈VbyN(i)={j∈V:{i,j}∈E}, and the closed neighborhood ofi∈VbyN[i]=N(i)∪{i}. A setD⊆Vis called a dominating set if each vertex inV⧹Dhas a neighbor in D, and a total dominating set if each vertex in V (including the vertices from D) has a neighbor in D. LetG[S]be the graph induced byS⊆V. A dominating set that induces a connected graph is called a connected dominating set. Let the distancedG(i,j)be the length of a shortest path between verticesi,j∈Vin a graph G, and letdiam(G)=max{dG(i,j):i,j∈V}be the diameter of G. We adopt the convention thatdiam(G)=∞for a disconnected graph G. A cliqueC⊆Vis a subset of pairwise adjacent vertices, i.e.,diam(G[C])=1. Mokken and Cliques (1979) introduced a clique relaxation model called an s-club, which is a subsetS⊆Vof vertices such thatdiam(G[S])⩽s. An s-club that forms a dominating set is called a dominating s-club.The minimum dominating clique problem has been shown to be polynomial-time solvable in strongly chordal graphs (Kratsch, 1990), undirected path graphs (Kratsch, 1990), and circle graphs (Keil, 1993). In general, however, the minimum dominating clique problem is NP-hard (Kratsch & Liedloff, 2007). In fact, it is NP-complete to determine the existence of a dominating clique in a graph (Brandstädt & Kratsch, 1985, 1987). An exact, exponential-time algorithm has been developed for arbitrary graphs (Kratsch & Liedloff, 2007).Since we want to restrict the diameter, the notion of s-club is important. Several papers in literature consider a different problem: the maximum s-club problem. Even though this problem is different from ours, it provides useful insights for complexity and IP formulations. The maximum s-club problem asks for a maximum size subset of vertices whose induced subgraph has diameter at most s. The decision version of the maximum s-club problem has been shown to be NP-complete (Bourjolly, Laporte, & Pesant, 2002), even when restricted to graphs of diameters+1(Balasundaram, Butenko, & Trukhanov, 2005). Some exact approaches for the maximum s-club problem are based on integer programming formulations withO(ns+1)entities (Balasundaram et al., 2005; Bourjolly et al., 2002). More recently, Veremyev and Boginski (2012) proposed a compact formulation havingO(sn2)entities. This compact formulation is key to the development of the formulation proposed in this paper, which also hasO(sn2)entities. The reader is referred to Pattillo, Youssef, and Butenko (2013) for more information on s-clubs and other clique relaxation models.The NP-hard minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) problem and the related maximum leaf spanning tree problem have received significant attention in the literature. A wide variety of approaches have been considered, including exact approaches (Fan & Watson, 2012; Fernau et al., 2011; Fomin, Grandoni, & Kratsch, 2008; Fujie, 2003; Fujie, 2004; Lucena, Maculan, & Simonetti, 2010; Simonetti, Salles da Cunha, & Lucena, 2011), approximation algorithms (Guha & Khuller, 1998; Lu & Ravi, 1998), and polynomial-time approximation schemes for unit disk graphs (Cheng, Huang, Li, Wu, & Du, 2003; Hunt et al., 1998) and unit ball graphs (Zhang, Gao, Wu, & Du, 2008).Considerably less work has been done for restricted-diameter dominating sets. Researchers have proposed heuristics (Mohammed et al., 2005) and approximation algorithms (Kim et al., 2009) with constant ratios for both CDS size and diameter (for disk graphs). Schaudt (2013) has shown that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameters+2has a dominating s-club. To the best of our knowledge, there are no exact approaches for the minimum dominating s-club problem in previous literature (for general s).In Section 2, we prove that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter two has a dominating clique. We extend this for any fixed positive integer s, showing that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameters+1admits a dominating s-club. We consider the minimization problem in Section 3, showing that it is NP-hard to approximate within a logarithmic factor, even when a dominating s-club is known to exist. We also relate the dominating s-club number to other domination-related graph invariants, and demonstrate that restricting the diameter by just one unit can be very costly. In Section 4, we present a compact integer programming formulation for the minimum dominating s-club problem and develop associated valid inequalities and variable fixing rules. Section 5 discusses the potential applicability of the formulation to solving the classical MCDS problem. Section 6 reports the results of numerical experiments with the proposed formulation for the minimum dominating s-club problem on a set of random unit disk graphs and MCDS instances from literature. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.In this section we consider the questions: (1) which graphs have a dominating s-club? and (2) what is the computational complexity of determining if a graph admits a dominating s-club?It is clear that not every graph has a dominating s-club, as evidenced by the class of disconnected graphs. However, even when the graph is connected, a dominating s-club may not exist; the cycle on six vertices has no dominating 2-club. Some have attempted to find sufficient conditions for a dominating s-club to exist. Cozzens and Kelleher (1990) show that a dominating clique exists if the graph has no inducedC5and no inducedP5. (PtandCtare the path and cycle on t vertices, respectively.) See also (Bacsó & Tuza, 1990). This has been extended for other values of s (Bacsó, 2009; Bacsó & Tuza, 1997; Tuza, 2008). Namely, fors=1ors=2, a dominating s-club will exist if the graph has no inducedCs+4and no inducedPs+4; fors⩾3, a dominating s-club will exist if there is no inducedPs+4(Tuza, 2008).In the following proposition, we note some simple cases where a dominating s-club will or will not exist.Proposition 1Consider a graphG=(V,E).1.For anys⩾diam(G), there exists a dominating s-club in G.Ifdiam(G)≥4then for anys<diam(G)-2, there does not exist a dominating s-club in G.It is clear that V is a dominating s-club in the first case. To prove the second case, consider verticesv,v′∈Vsuch thatdG(v,v′)=diam(G). We claim that a dominating s-club must includeu∈N(v)andu′∈N(v′). (Otherwise, v (orv′) must be dominated by itself, in which case v (orv′) is isolated and the dominating set is not connected.) Thus, for any dominating setS⊆V,dG[S](u,u′)⩾dG(u,u′)⩾diam(G)-2>s, implying that u andu′cannot belong to the same s-club.□This leaves two values of s where it is not yet clear if a dominating s-club exists or not:s=diam(G)-1ands=diam(G)-2. It turns out that these cases are NP-complete. The cases=diam(G)-2=1(i.e., dominating clique in diameter 3 graphs) has been shown by Brandstädt and Kratsch (1987). We and Schaudt (2013) independently show that the problem is NP-complete for each fixed positive integer s. We note however that the reduction used by Schaudt (2013) hass=diam(G)-2. Our reduction allows us to make a different statement—that the NP-completeness holds whens=diam(G)-1. First, we show that determining if a diameter two graph has a dominating clique is NP-complete. Then, using this fact, we describe NP-completeness reductions for evens⩾2and odds⩾3(both are provided in the appendix).Theorem 1The problem of determining if a graph of diameter two has a dominating clique is NP-complete.The reduction is from 3SAT (with exactly three literals per clause), where the instanceΦis defined by clausesC1∧⋯∧Cmand variablesx1,…,xn. For convenience, we make an assumption aboutΦthat does not affect the problem’s complexity. We assume thatΦis not satisfied by fixing onlyt⩽3variables.We construct a graphG=(V,E)of diameter two that has a dominating clique if and only ifΦis satisfiable. We abuse notation, referring to a variablexi(or its negationx‾i) and its associated vertexxi(x‾i) from G in the same way. We construct the vertex setV=X∪X‾∪Qas follows.(1)X={xi:1⩽i⩽n},(2)X‾={x‾i:1⩽i⩽n},(3)Q=Q1∪⋯∪Q5,(4)Qp={cpj:1⩽j⩽m}forp=1,…,5.So, we have a vertex for each variable, one for each negated variable, and five vertices for each clause. The edge setE=E1∪⋯∪E7is defined as follows.(5)E1={{xi,xj}:1⩽i<j⩽n},(6)E2={{x‾i,x‾j}:1⩽i<j⩽n},(7)E3={{xi,x‾j}:i≠j,1⩽i⩽n,1⩽j⩽n},(8)E4=Q1×Q5,(9)E5=⋃p=14Qp×Qp+1,(10)E6=⋃p=15{{xi,cpj}:xiappears in clauseCj},(11)E7=⋃p=15{{x‾i,cpj}:x‾iappears in clauseCj}.The reduction is clearly polynomial in time and space, and it is easy to see that graph G has diameter two. Note that the edge subsetsE1,E2,E3ensure that the edges fromG[X∪X‾]comprise a complete graph with a perfect matching{{xi,x‾i}:i=1,…,n}removed.Claim 1If the instance of 3SAT is satisfiable, then G has a dominating clique. Given a satisfying assignmentx∗, we construct a dominating clique S of G. Fori=1,…,n, choose vertexxiifxi∗is set to true and choose vertexx‾iotherwise. This set S of n chosen vertices induces a complete subgraph (since no pair{xi,x‾i}will be simultaneously chosen), so S is a clique. It is easy to see that clause vertices fromQp,p=1,…,5will be dominated by S due to the way in which the edge subsetsE6andE7were created. Finally, every vertex fromX∪X‾will be dominated by S, so S is dominating.No vertex from Q can belong to a dominating cliqueS⊆Vof G. See that forp=1,…,5at most one vertex fromQpcan belong to a clique sinceQpis an independent set. We consider two cases where|S∩Q|⩾1. In each case, we arrive at a contradiction.1.Case|S∩Q|⩾2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that|S∩Q1|=|S∩Q2|=1. This implies thatS∩Q3=S∩Q4=S∩Q5=∅since no vertex inQ3∪Q4∪Q5has neighbors in bothQ1andQ2. Letc1j∈S∩Q1andc2k∈S∩Q2. This set{c1j,c2k}is not dominating on its own, since no vertex inQ4will be dominated. So, we must have|S∩(X∪X‾)|⩾1. However,|N(c1j)∩N(c2k)|⩽3, so|N(c1j)∩N(c2k)∩S|⩽3. By the assumption aboutΦthat no three variables can satisfyΦon their own, S cannot dominate the vertices fromQ4.Case|S∩Q|=1. Without loss of generality, we can assume that|S∩Q1|=1. The proof is very similar to that of the previous case and is omitted.If G has a dominating clique, then the 3SAT instance is satisfiable. ByClaim 3, a dominating clique of G can only use vertices fromX∪X‾. Given a dominating cliqueS⊂X∪X‾, we construct a satisfying assignmentx∗. For each vertexxi∈Xdo the following. If the vertexxibelongs to S then setxi∗to true; otherwise, setxi∗to false. It is clear that since every clause vertex fromQ1was dominated by S, the assignmentx∗is satisfying.□For any fixed positive integer s, the problem of determining if a graph of diameters+1has a dominating s-club is NP-complete.The previous theorem holds by Lemmata 1 and 2 from the appendix. Thus, by Theorem 2, Proposition 1, and Schaudt (2013), a sharp transition in the complexity of Dominatings-club emerges, which is highlighted in Table 1.Here we consider the minimum dominating s-club problem, and relate the dominating s-club numberγclubs(G)to other domination-based graph invariants. Recall thatγ(G),γt(G),γc(G),γcl(G)denote the domination number, the total domination number, the connected domination number, and the dominating clique number of G, respectively. (Haynes, Hedetniemi, & Slater, 1998).Remark 1If a graph G has a dominating clique andγ(G)⩾2, then fors′⩾s⩾2the following inequalities hold:(12)γ(G)⩽γt(G)⩽γc(G)⩽γclubs′(G)⩽γclubs(G)⩽γcl(G).This remark shows that requiring a smaller diameter may come at the cost of a larger set. Given that a smaller diameter dominating set is usually preferred, it would be nice to bound this extra cost. Unfortunately, this cost can be very large indeed. This claim, stated formally in Remark 2, is demonstrated in the appendix.Remark 2For any fixed positive integer s, the ratioγclubs(G)/γclubs+1(G)for a graph G can be arbitrarily large.Now we consider the complexity of the minimum dominating s-club problem. Of course this is a difficult problem, because it is NP-complete to determine if any feasible solution exists. However, it could be that the difficulty lies only in finding a feasible solution. Remark 3, below, states that this is not the case. The minimization problem remains hard to approximate when a feasible solution is known.Recall that the minimum set cover problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor ofclognfor c constant (Alon, Moshkovitz, & Safra, 2006; Raz & Safra, 1997), where n refers to the number of elements that must be covered. Guha and Khuller (1998) have shown that the MCDS problem is hard to approximate to within a factor ofclogΔ, whereΔis the maximum degree of the graph, via a reduction from the minimum set cover problem. We note that the same reduction from (Guha & Khuller, 1998) shows that the minimum dominating s-club problem is hard to approximate for any fixeds⩾2, even when a feasible solution is known to exist. This holds because their construction ensures thatγclub2(G)=γc(G), and Remark 1 states thatγclubs(G)will be sandwiched between these values.Remark 3InapproximabilityLets⩾2be a fixed integer. It is NP-hard to approximate the minimum dominating s-club problem to within a factor ofclogΔwhere c is a constant (andΔis the maximum degree), even when a dominating s-club is known to exist.We use the s-club (diameter) constraints proposed by Veremyev and Boginski (2012) for the maximum s-club problem (constraints (15)–(20)). LetV={1,2,…,n}be the set of vertices. ForD⊆Vthe vectorx∈{0,1}nsuch thatxi=1iffi∈Dis called the characteristic vector of D. Then the minimum dominating s-club problem can be formulated as the following IP.(13)minimize∑i∈Vxi(14)subjectto∑j∈N[i]xj⩾1,i∈V;(15)∑r=2syij(r)⩾xi+xj-1,i∈V,j∈V⧹N[i];(16)yij(2)⩽xi,yij(2)⩽xj,yij(2)⩽∑p∈N(i)∩N(j)xp,j>i,i,j∈V;(17)yij(2)⩾C∑p∈N(i)∩N(j)xp+(xi+xj-2),j>i,i,j∈V;(18)yij(r)⩽xi,yij(r)⩽∑p∈N(i)ypj(r-1),r=3,…,s;j>i,i,j∈V;(19)yij(r)⩾C∑p∈N(i)ypj(r-1)+(xi-1),j>i,i,j∈V;(20)xi∈{0,1},yij(r)∈{0,1},i,j∈V,r∈{2,…,s}.In this formulation, x is the characteristic vector of the dominating s-club. The binary variableyij(r)takes a value of 1 iff there is a path of length r from vertex i to vertex j in the dominating s-club. C is a constant, which can be set to, e.g.,C=1n. As suggested by Veremyev and Boginski (2012), settingC=|N(i)∩N(j)|-1results in a tighter formulation. However, this is not applicable when|N(i)∩N(j)|=0. The objective is to minimize the cardinality of the dominating s-club. Constraint (14) ensures that each vertex is dominated. Proposition 2 and Remark 4 below will show that this classical domination constraint can be replaced with a stronger open neighborhood inequality∑j∈N(i)xj⩾1(assuming that no single vertex dominates V). Constraint (15) ensures that the distance between dominating verticesi,j∈Vis at most s. Constraints (16) and (17) are for paths of length 2, whereas constraints (18) and (19) are for paths of length more than 2. We refer the reader to Veremyev and Boginski (2012) for more detail on the s-club (diameter) constraints.Next, we explore some valid inequalities for dominating s-club. Note that any feasible solution to dominating s-club is feasible to CDS. Accordingly, the convex hull of feasible solutions to dominating s-club is a subset of that of CDS. Therefore, an inequality which is valid for CDS is valid for dominating s-club. A subset of vertices in a connected graph is called a cutset if its removal disconnects the graph.Proposition 2The following statements are valid for any characteristic vector x of a dominating s-club or a CDS.•Cutset inequalities. For any cutset C, we have(21)∑i∈Cxi⩾1.Open neighborhood inequalities.Suppose that no single vertex dominates V, then(22)∑j∈N(i)xj⩾1i∈V.Cut vertex fixing. Ifi∈Vis a cut vertex, thenxi=1.The cutset inequalities have been established by Yuan (2005). Open neighborhood inequalities follow from the cutset inequalities becauseN(i)is a cutset. Cut vertex fixing is given by Lucena et al. (2010). It also follows from the cutset inequalities by lettingC={i}.□It should be noted that Yuan (2005), in fact, shows that the collection of all minimal cutset inequalities (along with binary constraints on the variables) gives a proper formulation for CDS.Remark 4The open neighborhood inequalities for dominating s-club and CDS subsume the classical domination constraints.The previous proposition shows how to create valid inequalities and fix certain variables for CDS (and consequently, dominating s-club). We can establish stronger, analogous results for dominating s-club.Proposition 3Suppose a graph G has a dominating s-club, and let x be the characteristic vector of an arbitrary dominating s-club. Then the following statements hold.•Diameter-critical set inequalities.If there is a subset of verticesS⊆Vsuch thatdiam(G[V⧹S])⩾s+3, then(23)∑i∈Sxi⩾1.Diameter-critical vertex fixing.If there is a vertexi∈Vsuch thatdiam(G[V⧹{i}])⩾s+3, thenxi=1.We prove the diameter-critical set inequalities by contradiction. Suppose G has a dominating s-clubD′⊆V⧹S. SinceD′dominatesG,D′must also dominateG[V⧹S], which means thatD′is a dominating s-club forG[V⧹S]. By Proposition 1,G[V⧹S]has no dominating s-club fors<diam(G[V⧹S])-2. However,s⩽diam(G[V⧹S])-3, a contradiction. To establish diameter-critical vertex fixing, letS={i}and apply the diameter-critical set inequalities.□The diameter-critical set inequalities subsume the cutset inequalities.The following statement is valid for both dominating s-club and CDS. If there existJ⊂VandI⊆V⧹Jsuch that∀i∈I∃j∈JsatisfyingN[i]⊆N[j]orN(i)⊆N(j), then there exists an optimal solution withxi=0∀i∈I.Similar statements for closed neighborhood inclusion are well-known for the minimum dominating set problem (Alber, Fellows, & Niedermeier, 2004) and the MCDS problem (Lucena et al., 2010). To prove the statement for the minimum dominating s-club problem, consider I and J satisfying the closed neighborhood inclusion. Suppose that for somei∈I,xi=1in some feasible solution. Then for an arbitraryj∈Jsuch thatN[i]⊆N[j], x can be modified to obtain a feasible solution with the same objective value by settingxi=0andxj=1(ifxj≠1). All vertices that were dominated by i are now dominated by j. The diameter has not increased, as any shortest path through vertex i can use vertex j instead. This procedure can be repeated to obtain a feasible solution withxi=0∀i∈I.The proof for the open neighborhood inclusion is the same, except that i will not be dominated by j whenxj=0. However, by the open-neighborhood inequalities, there exists a neighbori′of i withxi′=1.□Consider a generalization of the minimum dominating s-club problem in which we let the parameter s depend on some input, such as the number n of vertices in the graph G. Then the MCDS problem can be solved via the minimum dominating s-club problem. In the naive approach, simply lets=n-1. However, more practical ways of choosing s may exist.Proposition 5Suppose U is an upper bound onγc(G). A solution to the minimum dominating s-club problem, wheres=(U-1), solves the MCDS problem.An optimal CDS has at most U nodes, thus its diameter is at mostU-1.□Suppose P solves the minimum dominating s-club problem in G. If|P|⩽s+2, then P solves the MCDS problem in G.Suppose P is an optimal solution of the minimum dominating s-club problem that is not optimal for the MCDS problem. Then there exists a CDSP∗with|P∗|⩽|P|-1. Thendiam(G[P∗])⩽|P∗|-1⩽|P|-2⩽s. ThereforeP∗is a dominating s-club of size less than|P|, contradicting the optimality of P.□The last two propositions lead to two different ways to solve the MCDS problem. In the first approach (using Proposition 5), use any MCDS heuristic to find a decent upper bound U onγc(G). Then solve the minimum dominating s-club problem withs=U-1to solve the MCDS problem.In the second approach, use Proposition 6 and solve a series of minimum dominating s-club problems for various values of s. Small values of s, which typically warrant applicability of effective scale-reduction techniques, may not give a small enough dominating s-club to apply Proposition 6. In a simple approach, start withs=diam(G)-2and solve the minimum dominating s-club problem. If Proposition 6 applies, then we have an optimal solution to the MCDS problem. Otherwise, increment s by 1 and repeat. This approach has the advantage that an optimal solution for one stage constitutes a feasible starting solution for the subsequent problem. On the other hand, Proposition 6 may not be applicable for any value ofs<γc(G)-1, potentially resulting in an excessive number of stages if (γc(G)-diam(G)) is large.Our preliminary numerical experiments with these approaches yielded results that were generally outperformed by other methods for MCDS proposed in the literature (Fan & Watson, 2012; Lucena et al., 2010), especially on instances with large diameter. However, our results were competitive on instances with a small CDS. We leave an in-depth investigation of the suitability of the proposed formulation for the MCDS problem for future work.
