A computational pipeline for quantification of mouse myocardial stiffness parameters

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Deformation of passively inflated mouse heart was measured with echo speckle tracking.The observed deformation was compared with simulations of a finite element model.Simulations spanned the range of published parameter estimates.Two lack-of-fit criteria were tried: node positions or gross phenotypes.Estimation turned out to be more precise when based on changes in gross phenotypes.

The mouse is an important model for theoretical–experimental cardiac research, and biophysically based whole organ models of the mouse heart are now within reach. However, the passive material properties of mouse myocardium have not been much studied.We present an experimental setup and associated computational pipeline to quantify these stiffness properties. A mouse heart was excised and the left ventricle experimentally inflated from 0 to 1.44kPa in eleven steps, and the resulting deformation was estimated by echocardiography and speckle tracking. An in silico counterpart to this experiment was built using finite element methods and data on ventricular tissue microstructure from diffusion tensor MRI. This model assumed a hyperelastic, transversely isotropic material law to describe the force–deformation relationship, and was simulated for many parameter scenarios, covering the relevant range of parameter space. To identify well-fitting parameter scenarios, we compared experimental and simulated outcomes across the whole range of pressures, based partly on gross phenotypes (volume, elastic energy, and short- and long-axis diameter), and partly on node positions in the geometrical mesh. This identified a narrow region of experimentally compatible values of the material parameters. Estimation turned out to be more precise when based on changes in gross phenotypes, compared to the prevailing practice of using displacements of the material points. We conclude that the presented experimental setup and computational pipeline is a viable method that deserves wider application.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The passive mechanical properties of the heart wall play an important role during the filling of the ventricle; for instance, stiffening of the myocardium can lead to diastolic dysfunction and heart failure [1]. Incorporating patient-specific geometries and material properties into biomechanical models holds promise for the improved diagnosis and treatment of heart failure [2,3]. In biomechanical models, the stress–strain relationship for myocardial tissue is described by constitutive laws whose parameters describe the material stiffness along the microstructural axes, e.g. fibre and sheet directions. Several studies have quantified passive myocardial stiffness in humans [3–5] and model organisms, such as the pig [6,7], dog [8,9], and rat [10] (seeTable 1, with references). Less well studied, however, is the mouse, which is an important model organism in cardiac research. Transgenic mouse models have been extensively used in cardiac research over the last decade, where manipulation of the mouse genome has provided several novel insights in the development of cardiac disease [11]. Alterations of the myocardial properties of the heart, both in the extracellular matrix and in the cardiomyocytes, are suggested to play a major role in development of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. Several mutations leading to heritable heart disease occur in both mouse and human [11], and the hearts have similar composition and function with regards to mechanical properties [12].Here we propose a workflow for estimation of passive material properties of mouse myocardium by comparing computer simulations of soft tissue mechanics to observed deformation under passive inflation of an excised mouse heart. Firstly, we estimate trajectories of material points by speckle tracking of echo data through the deformation from zero to end diastolic pressure levels. This deformation is used, together with fibre structure obtained from diffusion tensor MRI, to build meshes for computer simulations. Secondly, we run model simulations and use full factorial experimental designs to cover the biological relevant region of the parameter space for the transversely isotropic Guccione law [13]. The results show that the parameters of the constitutive law are not separately identifiable from these passive inflation measurements alone, in accordance with previous studies [14–16]. For the four-dimensional parameter space of the material law, we identify an elongated region of parameter combinations with nearly equivalent good fit to deformation data from passive inflation. We describe the structure of this parameter redundancy, and compare our findings with published estimates. Following a discussion of its advantages and limitations, we conclude that the presented pipeline merits wider application.
