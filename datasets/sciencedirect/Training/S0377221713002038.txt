@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider single-item (r, q) and (s, T) inventory systems with integer-valued demand processes. While most of the inventory literature studies continuous approximations of these models and establishes joint convexity properties of the policy parameters in the continuous space, we show that these properties no longer hold in the discrete space, in the sense of linear interpolation extension and L♮-convexity. This nonconvexity can lead to failure of optimization techniques based on local optimality to obtain the optimal inventory policies. It can also make certain comparative properties established previously using continuous variables invalid. We revise these properties in the discrete space.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper is concerned with two basic single-item inventory systems with integer-valued demand processes. We first investigate the properties of the key performance measures, including the recently developed discrete convexity concepts (see, e.g., Murota, 2003). We then revisit several other properties previously established assuming demand is continuous.The primary focus of the paper (Sections 2, 3, and 4) is on the continuous-review (r, q) inventory system where r is the reorder point and q is the order quantity. The demand process is a Poisson process with rate λ. Unsatisfied demand is backlogged. The replenishment leadtimes are exogenous and sequential (see Zipkin, 2000, Chapter 7 for detail), having identical distribution as the generic random variable L. This leadtime model includes the constant leadtime as a special case. Let D denote the steady-state leadtime demand, IN the net inventory (=inventory on-hand−backorders), and IP the inventory position (outstanding orders+net inventory), respectively. Then IN=IP−D, and IP is uniformly distributed on {r+1,…,r+q}, which is independent of D. Consequently, the average number of backorders is(1)B(r,q)=E[IN-]=1q∑y=r+1r+qE[(D-y)+],and the average on-hand inventory equals(2)I(r,q)=E[IN+]=r+(q+1)/2-E[D]+B(r,q).(To avoid the trivial case and without loss of generality, we assume that Pr(D=0)<1.) There are linear inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs at unit rates h>0 and p>0, respectively. Let K be the fixed ordering cost for each replenishment order. Then, the expected long-run average system cost is(3)C(r,q)=λKq+hI(r,q)+pB(r,q)=λK+∑y=r+1r+qG(y)q,where(4)G(y)=hE[(y-D)+]+pE[(D-y)+].To find the optimal (r∗, q∗) that minimizes C(r, q), a natural and traditional approach is to establish the joint convexity of C in (r, q), so that a local optimum is guaranteed to be globally optimal – a property we call Property LG for short – and therefore a global optimum can be found by descent algorithms. However, while the notion of convexity has long been established for functions on the real vector space, it was not so for functions defined on the integer vector space (termed discrete convexity) until more recently (see, e.g., Murota, 2003). This partly explains why in the inventory literature most studies on the properties of (r, q) systems assume continuous demands (Hariga and Ben-Daya, 1999; Hill, 1996; Hill et al., 2007; Jassen et al., 1998). It was also argued that the cost function for continuous demands can be an adequate approximation of the cost function for discrete demands only when the order quantity q is large enough (Zheng, 1992).For the continuous-demand model, it was shown that, as long as the cumulative demand is a nondecreasing stochastic process with stationary increments and continuous sample paths, IP is uniformly distributed on the interval (r, r+q], and D and IP are independent of each other (Serfozo and Stidham, 1978; Zipkin, 1986). Under these conditions, Zipkin (1986) proves that B(r, q) and I(r, q) are jointly convex in (r, q). His proof is given by explicitly expressing B(r, q) in terms of integrations involving the probability distribution function of D, taking second partial derivatives and then showing the Hessian matrix is nonnegative definite. Zhang (1998) provides a simpler proof for the same result. One essential step of Zhang’s proof is that IP has a continuous uniform distribution. Based on the joint convexity results, Zheng (1992) develops a geometric intuitive optimality condition for the continuous (r, q) system and compares the exact optimal solution with the approximate solution obtained from using the EOQ formula. He shows that the EOQ heuristic is a lower bound on the optimal order quantity and the relative cost error by employing this heuristic is bounded by 1/8=0.125. This error bound has subsequently been improved by Axsäter (1996) to(5-2)/2≈0.118and by Gallego (1998) to 0.0607 for a variant of the EOQ heuristic. Rao (2003) extends the above convexity results and sensitivity analysis to the continuous-time, continuous-demand (s, T) system with compound Poisson and Brownian motion demand processes. Liu and Song (2012) revisit Rao’s convexity results.Given the significant role joint convexity played in the analysis of continuous-demand models, it is natural to investigate whether similar properties still hold for the discrete counterparts. This is especially important when q and T are small so the continuous-demand approximation is not effective. Note that when these policy parameters take integer values, the methods employed by the above mentioned works for continuous models are no longer valid, so direct verification of discrete convexity is needed. It is also worth mentioning that there are some other recent applications of discrete convexity concepts and their continuous extensions in inventory models, which have greatly enhanced our understanding on the structural properties of these systems. See, for example, Lu and Song (2005) and Nadar et al. (2011) on assemble-to-order systems, Zipkin (2008) and Huh and Janakiraman (2010) on lost-sales models, Pang et al. (2012) on joint inventory-pricing problems, and Li and Yu (2011) on perishable inventory systems. Our findings in the two basic single-item batch ordering systems complement these studies and provide insights for future studies on the structural properties of these systems.We employ two notions of discrete convexity that guarantee Property LG. The first is the convexity of the linear interpolation of the discrete functions; it is also known as equivalent to multimodularity. The second is L♮-convexity. From the definitions of these two notions (see details in Section 2), neither one of them can imply the other. However, Murota (2005) shows that the two properties are equivalent subject to a unimodular coordinate transformation. That is, a multimodular function can be represented by a L♮-convex function through a unimodular coordinate transformation, and vice versa. In our analysis, we do not make such transformations.In Section 2, we show that B(r, q), I(r, q) and C(r, q) are not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension or in the sense of L♮-convexity, although some other structural properties hold. To make better connection to the familiar continuous model and to gain deeper insight, we also explore the L♮-convex properties of the continuous (r, q) system. In Section 3, we show that properties established in the literature for the continuous (r, q) model no longer hold in the discrete system. Correspondingly, we develop related properties for the discrete model. In Section 4, we extend our findings to the periodic-review (s, T) system with a Poisson demand, where T is the reorder interval and s is the order-up-to level. Other features are similar to the (r, q) system. Due to space concerns, some proofs are placed in Appendix A.For comparison purposes, for any function X in the discrete (r, q) system, we useX∼to denote its counterpart in the continuous system by treating r and q as continuous variables. For example, the expected long-run average cost of the continuous (r, q) system is(5)C∼(r,q)=λK+∫rr+qG(y)dyq,where G(·) is given by (4).In this section, we examine two notions on discrete convexity that assures Property LG, i.e., guarantees local optimality to be global optimality. Before introducing these notions, we first define some notations and present some preliminaries.Throughout the paper, denoteRto be the real line,R+the nonnegative real line,Zthe set of all integers andZ+the set of nonnegative integers. Let e1=(1,0), e2=(0,1), d2=e1−e2=(1,−1), andF={-e1,d2,e2}. For any given function f defined onS=Z×Z+defineΔ-e1f(x,y)=f(x-1,y)-f(x,y),Δe1f(x,y)=f(x+1,y)-f(x,y),Δe2f(x,y)=f(x,y+1)-f(x,y),Δd2f(x,y)=Δe1f(x,y)-Δe2f(x,y).For any given (r, q) policy, defineV(x)=E(D-x)+,V(r,u)=E[(D-r-u)+]=V(r+u).The following properties are straightforward to obtain but useful for later development.Lemma 1For anyx,u∈Zandq∈Zwith q⩾1:(i)V(x)is convex andΔV(x)=V(x+1)-V(x)=-Pr(D⩾x+1);V(r+1, u)=V(r, u+1);V(r,u)-V(r,w+1)=∑ℓ=uwPr(D>r+ℓ),w⩾u;B(r,q)=(1/q)∑u=1qV(r,u);Δe2B(r,q)=(1/q(q+1))∑u=1q(V(r,q+1)-V(r,u));Δe1B(r,q)=(1/q)(V(r,q+1)-V(r,1)).Definition 1For any given function f defined onS, a functionf̃defined onR×R+is called its extension iff̃agrees with f onS. Let flibe the linear interpolation extension of f onR×R+. The function f is called convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension if its linear interpolation extension fliis convex (see Altman et al., 2000 or Murota, 2005).The following results are due to Altman et al. (2000), Hajek (1985), and Glasserman and Yao (1994).Lemma 2(i)The real-valued function f defined onSis convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension if and only if it is multimodular, i.e.,(6)ΔξiΔξjf(x,y)⩽0,when (x, y), (x, y)+ξi, (x, y)+ξjand (x, y)+ξi+ξjare all elements inSforξi,ξj∈F.Convexity in the sense of the linear interpolation possesses Property LG.Unfortunately, our finding is,Proposition 1The functions B(r, q), I(r, q) and C(r, q) are not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension, or, equivalently, not multimodular.In order to show from Lemma 2 that B(r, q) is not jointly convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension, it is sufficient to prove that there exists(r0,q0)∈Ssuch that(7)Δd2Δe2B(r0,q0)=Δe2B(r0+1,q0)-Δe2B(r0,q0+1)>0.By Lemma 1 (v),(8)Δe2B(r+1,q)-Δe2B(r,q+1)=∑u=2q+1(V(r,q+2)-V(r,u))q(q+1)-∑u=1q+1(V(r,q+2)-V(r,u))(q+1)(q+2)=∑u=1q(V(r,1)-V(r,u+1))-∑u=1q(V(r,u+1)-V(r,q+2))q(q+1)(q+2).Note that from Lemma 1 (iii),(V(r,1)-V(r,u+1))-(V(r,u+1)-V(r,q+2))=∑ℓ=1uPr(D>r+ℓ)-∑ℓ=u+1q+1Pr(D>r+ℓ).For q=1, we have(9)∑u=1q(V(r,1)-V(r,u+1))-∑u=1q(V(r,u+1)-V(r,q+2))=Pr(D>r+1)-Pr(D>r+2)=Pr(D=r+2).But we can always find r such that Pr(D=r+2)>0. Thus, (8) and (9) imply (7).Note that, from (2),Δe2I(r,q)=Δe2B(r,q)+1/2. Thus, the nonconvexity of B(r, q) implies the nonconvexity of I(r, q).Finally, from (3),Δe2C(r+1,q)-Δe2C(r,q+1)=2λKq+1-λKq-λKq+2+(p+h)(Δe2B(r+1,q)-Δe2B(r,q+1)).Take K=1, λ=1, Pr(L=1)=1, p=10, h=1, r0=0 and q0=10, thenΔe2C(r0+1,q0)-Δe2C(r0,q0+1)=(35.5601)/(10·11·12)>0.This implies that C(r, q) is not jointly convex.□In this subsection, we look at another notion of discrete convexity that assures Property LG – L♮-convexity (see Murota, 2003). Among several equivalent characterizations of L♮-convexity, perhaps the following midpoint convexity is most geometrically appealing:Definition 2A function f defined onSis L♮-convex if the following midpoint property holds for all(x1,y1),(x2,y2)∈S:f(x1,y1)+f(x2,y2)⩾fx1+x22,y1+y22+fx1+x22,y1+y22,with max{∣x1−x2∣, ∣y1−y2∣}⩽2.A related property is submodularity:Definition 3A function f defined onSis supermodular iff((x1,y1)∧(x2,y2))+f((x1,y1)∨(x2,y2))⩾f(x1,y1)+f(x2,y2),where(x1,y1),(x2,y2)∈S. Similarly, a function f defined onSis submodular if −f is supermodular.The following properties are due to Hajek (1985) and Murota (2003).Lemma 3(i)A function f defined onSis supermodular if and only if for(x,y)∈S,Δe2f(x,y)-Δe2f(x+1,y)⩽0.L♮-convexity assures Property LG and implies submodularity.It has been shown in both theory and practice that, sometimes although a function is not L♮-convex in its original coordinates, it is L♮-convex after a coordinate transformation. For this reason, we are also interested in studying natural linear transformations of the policy variables in the (r, q) system. Let s=r+q be the order-up-to level and make a variable change q=s−r, the performance measures can be expressed asB(r,s)=B(r,s-r),I(r,s)=I(r,s-r),C(r,s)=C(r,s-r).Alternatively, expressing the performance measures as functions of (q, s), we haveB(q,s)=B(s-q,q),I(q,s)=I(s-q,q),C(q,s)=C(s-q,q).Before proceeding to examine L♮-convexity of the discrete system, to facilitate understanding of the concept of L♮-convexity, we first consider its extension to the real vector space; see, for example, Murota (2003), Murota and Shioura (2004), and Zipkin (2008).Lemma 4For a twice differentiable real functionf(x,y):R2→R,L♮-convexity means the combination of the following three properties:(i)Joint convexity:∂2f∂x2⩾0,∂2f∂y2⩾0,and∂2f∂x2∂2f∂y2-∂2f∂x∂y2⩾0;Submodularity: ∂2f/∂x∂y⩽0.Diagonal dominance of the Hessian matrix:∂2f∂x2⩾∂2f∂x∂yand∂2f∂y2⩾∂2f∂x∂y.Thus, L♮-convexity is much stronger than the usual joint convexity.For the continuous (r, q) policy, we know thatB∼(r,q),I∼(r,q)andC∼(r,q)are all jointly convex, so Lemma 4 (i) holds. Checking through the partial derivatives as in Zipkin (1986), we can show the following:Proposition 2For the continuous-demand model:(i)B∼(r,q),I∼(r,q)andC∼(r,q)are supermodular. Their Hessian matrices are Leontief1A matrix A is called Leontief if it has exactly one positive element in each column and there is a nonnegative vector x such that Ax>0. SeeVeinott (1969) and Koehler and Whinston (1980)for applications of Leontief matrices in production and inventory systems.1and diagonally dominant for the variable r but not for the variable q. They are not L♮-convex;B∼(q,s),I∼(q,s)andC∼(q,s)are jointly convex and submodular. Their Hessian matrices are diagonally dominant for the variable s but not for the variable q. They are not L♮-convex.Thus, the average cost of the continuous (r, q) model is not L♮-convex, even though it is jointly convex. This implies that while joint convexity in the continuous model is sufficient for Property LG, we need several more properties of the cost function when we optimize in the discrete space and therefore it is much harder to achieve. The proposition also reveals exactly which properties of the L♮-convexity break down in the (r, q) model. In addition, note that for continuous demand, Zipkin (2008) shows that, in the single-item lost-sales model, while the original single-stage lost-sales systems do not necessarily possess L♮-convexity, certain linear transformation of the state variables creates the property. Huh and Janakiraman (2010) extend this finding to the serial lost-sales systems, and Pang et al. (2012) show similar properties in the inventory-pricing problem. Unfortunately, our results above show that the natural linear transformations of the policy variables in the continuous (r, q) system also fail to possess L♮-convexity.We now examine the properties of the discrete system. We haveProposition 3For the discrete-demand model:(i)B(r, q), I(r, q) and C(r, q) are (ia) componentwise convex, (ib) supermodular, and (ic) not L♮-convex;B(r,s),I(r,s), andC(r,s)are (iia) componentwise convex, (iib) supermodular, and (iic) not L♮-convex;B(q,s),I(q,s), andC(q,s)are (iiia) componentwise convex, (iiib) submodular, and (iiic) not L♮-convex.The proof is given in Appendix A. Result (ia) implies that we can easily optimize one policy parameter with the other parameter fixed. Denoter(q)=argminrC(r,q),q(r)=argminqC(r,q).Result (ib) implies that r(q) is nonincreasing in q and q(r) is nonincreasing in r. Similar implications apply to parts (ii) and (iii). In addition, by the definition of L♮-convexity, the parts (ic) and (iic) are immediate from (ib) and (iib), respectively. Thus, in the discrete space too, both the original (r, q) system and the natural linear transformations do not possess L♮-convexity.Due to its closed-form solution and robustness, the EOQ formula is often used as a heuristic order quantity in (r, q) systems even though it assumes deterministic demand. So, it is of interest to study how the EOQ model compares to the stochastic model.When demand is deterministic, the long-run average cost is given by (3) with G(y) replaced by(10)G^(y)=p(ED-y)++h(y-ED)+.Denote by (r0, q0) the resulting optimal policy, where the superscript “0” indicates “zero” demand variability.For any fixed order quantity q, let r(q)=argminrC(r, q) to be the corresponding optimal reorder point. The relative cost error (i.e., optimality loss) of using the policy (r(q), q), as opposed to using the optimal policy (r∗, q∗), is(11)err(q)=C(r(q),q)-C(r∗,q∗)C(r∗,q∗).Let (rc, qc) denote the optimal policy for the continuous-demand model, i.e.,C∼(rc,qc)=minr,qC∼(r,q). When demand is continuous and deterministic, we obtain the EOQ model, and the long-run average cost is given by (5) with G(y) replaced by (10). The corresponding optimal policy parameters (re, qe) have the following closed-form expressions:(12)qe=2λKhω,re=ED-(1-ω)qe,where ω=p/(p+h). The resulting system cost isC∼(r̃(qe),qe), wherer̃(q)=argminrC∼(r,q). Denote the relative cost error of this heuristic byerr∼(qe)=C∼(r̃(qe),qe)-C∼(rc,qc)C∼(rc,qc)Letq¯=(qe)2+(1/hp)Var(D)(h+p)2. Proposition in Axsäter (1996) and Theorem 1 in Gallego (1998) show thatLemma 5For the continuous (r, q) system,(i)qe⩽qc⩽q¯;err∼(qe)⩽5-2/2≈0.118.For discrete demand, the continuous-demand cost function (5) is an adequate approximation of (3) only when the order quantity q is not too small. In this case, it is reasonable to apply Lemma 5. Otherwise, this assertion may not be reliable. Indeed, we found counterexamples, which are presented in the next section.Note that the EOQ order quantity qemay not be an integer, so the first question is how to adapt the EOQ-based heuristic to the discrete model. Natural choices are ⌈qe⌉ and ⌊qe⌋. (Gallego, 1998 has a similar discussion and suggestion.) The following two examples show Lemma 5 fail to hold for both choices.Example 1Counterexample to Lemma 5 (i).Let D=12 with probability one, p=2.5, h=1 and K=157.5. We have qe=qc=21 and q∗=20. Thus q∗<qe=⌈qe⌉=⌊qe⌋.Let L=1 with probability one, λ=0.2, p=9 and h=2, K=2. We have qe=0.6992 and q∗=2. This consequently impliesq∗>q¯=1.3540.Counterexample to Lemma 5 (ii). Let L=1 with probability one, λ=1, p=3.2, h=5.4 and K=1. Thenr∗q∗r(⌈qe⌉)qeC(r(⌈qe⌉),⌈qe⌉))C(r∗,q∗)err(⌈qe⌉)-1200.3743.6824.1640.131Recall that in the continuous model, qeis the optimal order quantity when demand is deterministic. So, Lemma 5 compares the result of the stochastic system with its deterministic counterpart. Thus, it is interesting to see whether such a comparison carries through in the discrete model, i.e., whether Lemma 5 holds if we replace qcby q∗ and qeby q0. The following examples show that, unfortunately, the answer is No.Example 3Counterexample to Lemma 5 (i). Letting p=1, h=10, λ=2, K=28, and Pr(L=1)=1, we haver∗q∗r0q0rcqcreqe-911-912-8.828011.5844-8.090511.0995Thus, in the discrete system, we can have q∗<q0, i.e., the order quantity under stochastic demand can be less than that under deterministic demand.Counterexample to Lemma 5 (ii).

To see these properties, it is important to review how to determine (r∗, q∗) and (r0, q0). We use the method given by Federgruen and Zheng (1992), which is based on the fact that −G(y) is unimodal. Let y1 be the smallest integer that minimizes G(·) over all integers. Assuming that {y1,…,yk} have been generated for some k⩾1, defineL(k)=min{y1,…,yk}andR(k)=max{y1,…,yk}. Let(13)yk+1=L(k)-1,ifG(L(k)-1)⩽G(R(k)+1),R(k)+1,otherwise.Then, {y1,…,yq} are contiguous, and G(yk) is the kth smallest G(·) value, k=1,…,q. Using these, we have(14)q∗isthesmallestintegerqsuchthat1qλK+∑k=1qG(yk)⩽G(yq+1),(15)theoptimalreorderpointisr∗=L(q∗)-1.A key observation is(16)q<q∗ifandonlyif1qλK+∑k=1qG(yk)>G(yq+1).When demand is deterministic, because-G^(y)is also unimodal, (r0, q0) can be computed using the same procedure withG^(y)replacing G(y). In particular, similarly to (13), we can generate {z1,…,zq} to be contiguous, andG^(zk)is the kth smallestG^(·)value, k=1,…,q. DefineL^(k)=min{z1,…,zk}andR^(k)=max{z1,…,zk}. Then,(17)q0isthesmallestintegerqsuchthat1qλK+∑k=1qG^(zk)⩽G^(zq+1),(18)r0=L^(q0)-1,and(19)q<q0ifandonlyif1qλK+∑k=1qG^(zk)>G^(zq+1).The continuous counterparts of (16) and (19) are the following geometrically appealing equalities (see Zheng, 1992)(20)1qλK+∫r̃(q)r̃(q)+qG(y)dy=G(r̃(q)+q),(21)1qλK+∫ED-qhω/pED+qωG^(y)dy=G^(ED+qω).Noting that the curve G(y) is flatter thanG^(y), the following two inequalities are instrumental to obtain Lemma 5 (i):(22)0⩽dG(r̃(q)+q)dq⩽hω,and(23)∫r̃(q)r̃(q)+q[G(r̃(q)+q)-G(y)]dy⩽∫ED-qhω/pED+qω[G^(ED+qω)-G^(y)]dy.The discrete version of the derivative in (22) should be(24)G(max{yℓ:1⩽ℓ⩽i+1})-Gmax{yℓ:1⩽ℓ⩽i},see (13). However, the bounds on (24) would not be useful for developing the solution bounds in the discrete system. What we need are bounds for G(yi+1)−G(yi). We can showLemma 6(i)0⩽G(yi+1)−G(yi)⩽min{p, h};∑i=1q[G(yq+1)-G(yi)]⩽∑i=1q+1[G^(zq+2)-G^(zi)].This leads to the following revised Lemma 5 (i) in the discrete space:Proposition 4(i)q0⩽q∗+1;If qe⩾1, then ⌊qe⌋−1⩽q0⩽⌈qe⌉+1 and ⌊qe⌋−1⩽q∗+1.To establish Lemma 5 (ii), the key relations are (12) and(25)G(r̃(q)+q)⩾G^(ED+qω)=hqωforanyq⩾0.and the inequality(26)18-1212-qeqc2⩽18.Let H(q)=G(yq) andH^(q)=G^(zq), where yqand zqare given in (13), the discrete counterparts of (12) and (25) areLemma 7(i)For any positive integerq,H(q)⩾H^(q)⩾hω(q-1).λK⩽hω(q0+1)2.Instead of the inequality (26), we obtain two different inequalities in the discrete space specified in the next lemma. Definef1(x)=141+1x2xx-1,f2(x)=181+3x2xx-1.By checking the signs of the derivatives of these functions, it is straightforward to showLemma 8Both f1(x) and f2(x) are decreasing functions on [3, ∞). Hence,f1(x)⩽f1(3)=23andf2(x)⩽f2(3)=34for all x⩾3.With this, we obtain the following weaker result than Lemma 5 (ii) in the discrete space:Proposition 5(i)If q0⩾3, thenerr(q0)⩽f1(q0)⩽23;If ⌊qe⌋⩾4, thenerr(⌊qe⌋-1)⩽f2(⌊qe⌋-1)⩽34.Recall that ⌊qe⌋−1⩽q∗+1 by Proposition 4 (ii). Using ⌊qe⌋−1 as an EOQ-based heuristic order quantity for the discrete system, we can view Proposition 4 (ii) and Proposition 5 (ii) as the discrete version of Lemma 5 in terms of assessing the effectiveness of the EOQ-based heuristic. Similarly, Proposition 4 (i) and Proposition 5 (i) are the discrete counterparts of Lemma 5 in terms of assessing the impact of ignoring demand variability.We now examine the discrete periodic-review (s, T) inventory system. Here, the inventory position IP(t) is reviewed every T periods. If, upon review, IP(t) is below s, then order enough to bring IP(t) back to s; otherwise, do nothing. The demand process is a Poisson process with per-period demand rate λ. That is, let D(1) denote the demand for one period, then D(1) has a Poisson distribution with parameter λ. The leadtime for each replenishment order is assumed to be a positive integer ℓ. There is a fixed order cost K, a per-period unit inventory holding cost h, and a per-period unit backorder cost p. Note that the cumulative demand in t-periods, denoted by D(t), has a Poisson distribution with parameter λt. Letpλ(n,t)=e-λt(λt)nn!,Pλ(n,t)=∑k=0npλ(k,t).Following a similar argument as in Rao (2003) (see also Liu and Song 2012), the long-run average inventory and backorders under the (s, T) policy are respectively(27)I(s,T)=1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+TE[(s-D(t))+]=1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T∑n=0s-1(s-n)pλ(n,t),(28)B(s,T)=1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+TE[(D(t)-s)+]=1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T(λt-s)+I(s,T).Therefore, the long-run average cost under the (s, T) policy is(29)C(s,T)=KTPr(D(T)>0)+hI(s,T)+pB(s,T)=KT(1-e-λT)+hI(s,T)+pB(s,T).Parallel to the discrete (r, q) system, in the following, we carry out the analysis for the discrete (s, T) system. Before proceeding, we first present some properties which are straightforward from (27) and (28).Lemma 9(i)Δe1B(s,T)=Δe1I(s,T)-1;Δe1I(s-1,T)=(1/T)∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+TPλ(s-1,t);)Δe2B(s,T)=λ/2+Δe2I(s,T);For any function f(·, ·) defined onS, we haveΔe2f(x-1,y)-Δe2f(x,y)=Δe1f(x-1,y)-Δe1f(x-1,y+1).It follows from Lemma 9 thatProposition 6The functionC(s,T)for the discrete system is not convex in the sense of linear interpolation extension nor in the sense of L♮-convexity.The proof of the proposition is similar to the proof of Proposition 1, and is given in Appendix A. Furthermore, we have the following result which is the discrete version of that in Liu and Song (2012).Proposition 7For the discrete (s, T) system,C(s,T)is componentwise convex and submodular. Hence,s(T)=argminsC(s,T)is nondecreasing in T, andT(s)=argminTC(s,T)is nondecreasing in s.For any fixed T, the convexity ofB(s,T)in s directly follows from Lemma 9 (ii). In view of Lemma 9 (i), we have the convexity ofC(s,T)in s.We now argue that for any fixeds,C(s,T)is convex in T. Note thatI(s,T)=1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T(s-λt)+B(s,T)and1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T(s-λt)=s-T+1+2ℓ2λ.By the convexity of K(1−e−λT)/T and −(T+1+2ℓ)/2, and (29), it suffices to show the convexity ofB(s,T)in T.Let U(T) be a uniform distribution on {1,…,T} and independent of the demand process D(t). Then from (28),(30)B(s,T)=E[(D(ℓ+U(T))-s)+].By Example 8.A.2 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), we know that the Poisson process D(t) is stochastically increasing and linear (SIL). Noting that for any fixed s, the function (t−s)+ is an increasing convex in t, thus, by Theorem 8.A.17 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) and (30), to get the convexity ofB(s,T)in T, it suffices to show that the uniform distribution U(T) is also SIL. To the end, for any increasing convex (concave) function g(·) defined on {0,1,2,…}, we need to show thatEg(U(T))isanincreasingconvex(concave)functioninTon{0,1,2,…}.As U(T+1) is stochastically larger than U(T), it is straightforward to see the monotonicity of Eg(U(T)). Here we only consider the convexity of Eg(U(T)) when g(·) is convex. The concavity for the case in which g(·) is concave can be proved similarly. It is sufficient to show that(31)Eg(U(T+2))+Eg(U(T))⩾2Eg(U(T+1)).Note thatEg(U(T+2))+Eg(U(T))-2Eg(U(T+1))=1T+2∑k=1T+2g(k)-1T+1∑k=1T+1g(k)-1T+1∑k=1T+1g(k)-1T∑k=1Tg(k)=1T+2(g(T+2)-g(T+1))-2T(T+1)(T+2)∑k=1T(g(T+1)-g(k))⩾1T+2(g(T+2)-g(T+1))-2T(T+1)(T+2)T(T+1)2(g(T+1)-g(T))⩾0.Hence, we have (31). Thus the convexity ofB(s,T)in T is obtained.Next we prove submodularity. Using Lemma 9 (ii) and (iv), we haveΔe1I(s,T+1)-Δe1I(s,T)=1T+1∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T+1Pλ(s,t)-1T∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+TPλ(s,t)=1T(T+1)∑t=ℓ+1ℓ+T+1(Pλ(s,ℓ+T+1)-Pλ(s,t)).Note that the first term is the probability that the demand is less than or equal to s in the interval (0, (l+T+1)] and the second term is the probability that the demand is less than or equal to s in the interval (0, t] by a Poisson process with parameter λ. When t⩽l+T, we know thatΔe1I(s,T+1)-Δe1I(s,T)⩽0.Hence, Lemma 3 implies the submodularity ofI(s,T). Consequently, the submodularity ofC(s,T)follows from (29) and Lemma 9 (i). □
