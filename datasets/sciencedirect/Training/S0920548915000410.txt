Information privacy policies: The effects of policy characteristics and online experience

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
This study proposes that privacy policies’ characteristics significantly affect perceptions of importance and relevance.This study used an experiment procedure using two respondent groups based on sensitivity of information asked.The clarity of the policy has the strongest influence on importance.Visibility has the strongest influence on relevance.Respondents faced with high information sensitivity conditions perceived higher importance and relevance.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Careful design of information privacy policies is one significant means to induce providing personal information. This research takes three design elements – length, visibility, and specificity – and tests their effectiveness to address information sensitivity, measuring perceived importance and relevance of the policy to decisions to share personal information. The experiment results show that visibility and specificity takes priority. Furthermore, high information sensitivity conditions induce higher perceptions of importance and relevance. Research implications suggest that managers should consider maximizing the benefits of these policy characteristics to induce consumers to read the policy and make it a significant consideration in sharing personal information.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Privacy concerns continue to be a struggle, especially in e-commerce settings where some personal information must be shared to do business [1]. Much of the discussion on information privacy pertains to organizations ensuring that the collected customer information are properly stored, analyzed, and used [2–5]. Developing clear and concrete information privacy policies is one important alternative to make this assurance [4,6,7]. However, moment-to-moment privacy concerns are contextual cues [8] and usually based on different individual behaviors [9], bearing little connection to the trade-offs of providing information [10,11]. This emphasizes the increasing difficulty of designing privacy policies and regulations [9].This research focuses further on one specific function of privacy assurance: the information privacy policies published by the organization on its website. This is an ongoing issue of interest because of the fact that to use a website, users must agree to the information privacy policy [12,13] and provide some personal input [9], regardless if the website is a traditional e-commerce website or a breakthrough social media website. This research insists that observing consumers' behavioral responses in real online settings is a very important aspect of privacy research [2,14,15] to specify and develop user preferences [4,10,16], which can be framed via these privacy policies [1]. There is much to be said on what the consumers should do to ensure that their privacy is indeed protected because of the fragmented nature of information privacy protection issues [5,7,16]. In other words, if there is so much pressure for the organizations to come up with clear and concrete information privacy policies, then consumers should be able to reciprocate that effort by reading and understanding these policies. Reading and understanding these policies would also evaluate whether or not the organization is actually satisfying consumer privacy concerns. Therefore, this research would examine some factors that influence consumers actually reading and actually understanding these policies [10,11], and furthermore, how can these factors interact with one another. This would be beneficial to the organization to strategize how to actually acquire more value from such policies. Even if it is integrated in the design of the website [3], actually encouraging consumers to read through them is still a great challenge.One of the biggest concerns is that even top-ranked Web site privacy policies are long and hard to understand, making it is less likely that consumers will read such policies [1,17,18], and develop favorable attitudes in online, foregoing opportunities to address privacy concerns and build trust. Furthermore, significant limitations hound this kind of trust-building practice, such as managing a dilemma of adopting either an “all-or-nothing” approach or a highly diversified disclosure approach tailored to different levels of trust [16], and coping with few opportunities to exert greater control over data exchanges [7]. Worse, people do not always act consistently with their stated privacy preferences [10,19].This study shows how individual perceptions of information sensitivity affect perceptions on the importance of having a privacy policy. Furthermore, policy characteristics such as length, visibility, and specificity affect perceptions on the importance and relevance of having a privacy policy. The length of the policy affects its relevance, while its visibility and specificity affects both its importance and relevance. Additionally, there is an interaction effect of information sensitivity on the policy's visibility towards perceptions on the importance of having a privacy policy. With these results, this study contributes to the literature in two major ways. The first is by emphasizing the fact that aside from its actual content, the different methods in which a privacy policy is designed and communicated is also of equal importance. Furthermore, how to these different methods can potentially interact with one another is an additional contribution. This study also suggests which method should be prioritized, which is its visibility in this particular case. The second contribution stems from the characteristics of the sample used, which presents a relatively unique and largely unexplored context but has one of the highest degrees of online presence and use.A key managerial issue is the manner in which consumers are informed of such policies [20,21]. In the case of privacy policies, characteristics such as message format and complexity [1,22,23], and the means of disseminating these policies [6] can influence consumers' overall perceptions on the privacy policy. Furthermore, having accurate information encourages actions consistent with the individual's or the society's best interests [11]. In other words, no matter the content of the policy itself, which is more or less standardized these days [3,5,16], the manner in which this content is delivered is of more importance [12]. Given these issues, the following research questions are thus proposed:1)Do online consumers really read a website's published or posted information privacy policies?What factors would encourage or discourage consumers to read and understand these information privacy policies?
