@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The goal of multiple foreground cosegmentation (MFC) is to extract a finite number of foreground objects from an input image collection, while only an unknown subset of such objects is presented in each image. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised framework for decomposing MFC into three distinct yet mutually related tasks: image segmentation, segment matching, and figure/ground (F/G) assignment. By our decomposition, image segments sharing similar visual appearances will be identified as foreground objects (or their parts), and these segments will be also separated from background regions. To relate the decomposed outputs for discovering high-level object information, we construct foreground object hypotheses, which allows us to determine the foreground objects in each individual image without any user interaction, the use of pre-trained classifiers, or the prior knowledge of foreground object numbers. In our experiments, we first evaluate our proposed decomposition approach on the iCoseg dataset for single foreground cosegmentation. Empirical results on the FlickrMFC dataset will further verify the effectiveness of our approach for MFC problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Aiming at extracting the commonly presented objects, image cosegmentation [1] performs joint segmentation on a set of images sharing overlapping contents. Originally, such cosegmentation is performed on a pair of input images (e.g., [1–4]), later its extension to handling a collection of relevant images attracts more attention from researchers. While supervised cosegmentation methods utilizing user interaction [5] or pre-trained classifiers [6,7] have been presented, some further proposed to observe visual features for performing cosegmentation in an unsupervised setting (e.g., [8,9]), so that the foreground objects can be identified automatically.Recently, Kim and Xing [10,11] proposed to solve the problem of multiple foreground cosegmentation (MFC), which is to identify multiple foreground objects and the background simultaneously during the cosegmentation process. In MFC, the number of foreground objects in each image is typically unknown. In addition, the background presented across images might be different as well. Therefore, MFC is a very challenging task to address.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework for MFC. As depicted in Fig. 1, we decompose MFC into three distinct computer vision problems: image segmentation, segment matching, and figure/ground (F/G) assignment. While the first task discriminates between image segments, the second task aims at identifying foreground segments across images, and the last task is to separate the foreground segments from background regions. As discussed in Section 3, our decomposition derives and associates solutions of each task in a unified optimization framework. In our experiments, we first evaluate the performance of our method on single foreground object cosegmentation using the iCoseg dataset [5]. The use of the FlickrMFC dataset [10] further verifies the application of our approach for MFC.•We propose a novel framework which decomposes MFC into three well-studied computer vision tasks, i.e., image segmentation, segment matching, and figure/ground assignment. By properly associating and updating the outputs from each task, the goal of MFC can be achieved.With the proposed decomposition framework, background statistics can be observed across images, and thus background regions can be automatically disregarded. Moreover, the construction of object hypothesis is able to recover foreground objects containing multiple segments, while no prior knowledge on the number of foreground objects is needed.
