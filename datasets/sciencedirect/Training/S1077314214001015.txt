@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Statistical shape models (SSMs) are a well-established tool in medical image analysis. The most challenging part of SSM construction, which cannot be solved trivially in 3D, is the establishment of corresponding points, so-called landmarks. A popular approach for solving the correspondence problem is to minimize a groupwise objective function using the optimization by re-parameterization approach. To this end, several objective functions, optimization strategies and re-parameterization functions have been proposed. While previous evaluation studies focused mainly on the objective function, we provide a detailed evaluation of different correspondence methods, objective functions, re-parameterization, and optimization strategies. Moreover and contrary to previous works, we use distance measures that compare landmark shape vectors to the original input shapes, thus adequately accounting for correspondences which undersample certain regions of the input shapes. Additionally, we segment binary expert segmentations to benchmark SSMs constructed from different correspondences. This new evaluation technique overcomes limitations of the correspondence based evaluation and allows for directly quantifying the influence of the correspondence on the expected segmentation accuracy. From our evaluation results we identify pitfalls of the current approach and derive practical recommendations for implementing a groupwise optimization pipeline.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Statistical shape models (SSMs) [1] capture the shape variability of a particular object class on the basis of a representative training population. The strength of SSMs is their ability to adapt elastically to previously unseen, patient specific shape instances under the constraint of statistical plausibility. This predestines them for a wide variety of medical image computing applications, such as image segmentation [2–5], shape analysis [6,7] and shape extrapolation [8,9].A linear SSM is learned by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a set of training shapes represented by vectors of corresponding landmarks. Training shapes are typically generated from binary segmentations using standard algorithms such as Marching Cubes [10], which yields surface meshes with varying number of points and no inherent index correspondence. Therefore, the elementary prerequisite for SSM construction is to identify corresponding points (so-called landmarks) across all training samples.Solving the correspondence problem is actually the most challenging part of SSM construction and demands for application of automatic methods in a 3D setting (Section 3). To this end, a wide range of different methods have been developed since the invention of SSMs by Cootes et al. [1]. One can divide these methods into two categories: pairwise and groupwise approaches. Subsequently, we briefly introduce these two basic concepts. Since our work focuses on 3D anatomical structures, we restrict ourselves to methods that have been explicitly designed to handle 3D shapes or for which the extension from 2D to 3D is straightforward. For a more profound analysis of the subject, the reader is referred to the review of Heimann and Meinzer [3]. Moreover, we refer to [11] for a review on correspondence in computer graphics in general.Pairwise approaches for establishing correspondence resort to some kind of registration algorithm, which establishes correspondence between two shapes. The registration algorithm either registers surface meshes [12], adapts meshes to binary images [13] or establishes correspondence completely in the image domain, for example using image registration [14,15]. In order to obtain landmarks, one can define them on a single training example, the template, and propagate these landmarks to all other examples through the registration process [16]. Because quality of correspondence may vary significantly with different choices of the template, the template can be iteratively re-estimated to improve the results [17]. Yet a different approach to reduce the bias introduced by the template is to construct a binary shape tree [18,19] or a minimum spanning shape tree [20] from a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of training shapes. The landmarks are then propagated along this tree, thus ensuring that a pairwise registration is only done for shapes that are similar.The correspondence measure in pairwise approaches is often implicitly defined through the selected registration algorithm. These range from purely distance based measures like in the frequently employed Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm [12] and its variants [18,17,21] to features such as curvature [22], physical properties such as the thin-plate-spline bending energy [16,23], or image information in case of elastic or affine image registration such as normalized mutual information [14,15] or label consistency [24].Alternatively, shapes can be represented using particular basis functions. Inherent correspondence is then defined by identifying points featuring the same basis function coefficients for all shapes. A prominent approach is to use spherical harmonics for description of closed surfaces [25]. This so-called SPHARM model [4] has already proven its feasibility for the construction of SSMs of objects with varying complexity [6,7,26–28] that are homeomorphic to the unit 2-sphere. The variational approach of Lamecker et al. [29,5] is not limited to objects that are topologically equivalent to the sphere but requires the manual identification of cutting lines.In groupwise approaches, the correspondence between two shapes depends on all other examples in the training set. Intuitively, each training example provides additional information about the true anatomical variation, and thus helps to determine the correspondence between the other shapes. Groupwise approaches explicitly measure correspondence with an objective function, which usually depends on the computed SSM. The key idea is that the optimal set of corresponding points inherently provides the “best” model. Arguably the most renowned objective function is the minimum description length (MDL) function introduced by Davies et al. [30], which is founded on information theory. For optimizing this objective function, Davies formulates the correspondence problem as one of reparameterization[31]: All training shapes are mapped to a suitable parameter space, which reflects the topology of the shapes. The objective function is then minimized by manipulating these parameterizations.The MDL objective function is complex and its evaluation costly. Similar cost functions [32] and simplifications of the full MDL objective function exist [33], which typically have the disadvantage that they are controlled by (at least) one free parameter, for which there is no obvious choice. Up to now, the influence of this parameter on the resulting models has not been thoroughly studied. Beside this, the optimization may be influenced by the choice of the re-parameterization function, by the choice of the employed optimization strategies such as coarse-to-fine approaches [31,34], and by including additional parameters such as the shapes’ pose. The different approaches will be reviewed in more detail in Section 2.2.Evidently, a large number of possible combinations of the aforementioned building blocks can be imagined. However, up to now there exists no study that aims at benchmarking which combination provides the correspondence that performs best. Moreover, with the current evaluation methodology, it is not possible to directly quantify the influence of correspondence on the performance of SSMs in an application such as medical image segmentation. In particular, while it allows to rank different models, it does not estimate the gain in segmentation accuracy that can be obtained by building better models. Thus, the elementary aspect of this article is to provide a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation of different SSMs that have been constructed using groupwise optimization by varying all of the aforementioned components, and, by this means, close the gap between correspondence evaluation and SSM-based image segmentation.
