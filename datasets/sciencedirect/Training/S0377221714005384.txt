@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In some important group decision making, a moderator representing the collective interest, who has predetermined, and possesses an effective leadership and strong interpersonal communication and negotiation skills, is crucial to the consensus reaching. In the process of consensus reaching, the moderator needs to persuade each individual to change his/her opinion towards a consensus opinion by paying a minimum cost, while the individuals have to modify and to gradually approach this consensus opinion by expecting to obtain a maximum compensation. This paper, which proposes two kinds of minimum cost models with regard to all the individuals and one particular individual respectively, shows the economic significance of these two models by exploring their dual models grounded in the primal–dual linear programming theory, and builds the conditions under which these two models have the same optimal consensus opinion. The validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Group decision making (GDM) (Arrow, 1963; Palomares, Liu, Xu, & Martínez, 2012) requires the subjective judgment of a number of decision makers (DMs) to solve complex and unstructured problems, such as negotiations and conflict resolutions. In the process of GDM, different DMs may represent different interest groups, and may have different values or preferences even they have the same interest. In a GDM, most DMs may eventually arrive at a certain degree of consensus associated with the most relevant alternatives after thought-provocative discussions and many round of negotiations. The consensus decision making (Eklund, Rusinowska, & De Swart, 2007, 2008; French, 1981; Lehrer & Wagner, 1981; Liu & Zhang, 2013; Palomares, Martínez, & Herrera, 2014) is the base of making group choices. In recent years, abundant achievements have been made in the fields of consensus measure and consensus modeling.Consensus measure is mainly about the similarity or dissimilarity among DMs’ opinions (preferences, interests). The early literatures suggest a “hard” approach (Bezdek, Spillman, & Spillman, 1978; Spillman, Bezdek, & Spillman, 1979) to measure the consensus level of a group, where the value of consensus level is between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the index is, the higher consensus level is achieved; and conversely, the closer to 0 the index is, the lower consensus level is. The “hard” approach to consensus modeling is based on the premise that a full agreement within the group has been arrived at, which is also called a Utopian consensus by Tapia García, Del Moral, Martínez, and Herrera-Viedma (2012). It is difficult to achieve such a complete consensus (Cabrerizo, Moreno, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010). Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi (1986, 1988, 1989), Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi (1989, 1992, 1997) and Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk, and Nurmi (1993) propose a “soft” method instead of the “hard” approach to measure the consensus level which is also referred as “soft” consensus degree level (Chiclana, Tapia Garcia, del Moral, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013). Since the key elements in GDM are based on human thinking and subjective judgment, most experts only expect to reach a fuzzy-majority-sense consensus at the best. The development of soft decision making theories such as fuzzy decision making theory and linguistic decision making theory provides a rich tool to the “soft” approach-oriented research over recent years (Ben-Arieh & Chen, 2006; Bezdek et al., 1978; Cabrerizo, Alonso, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2008; Carlsson et al., 1992; Dong, Xu, & Li, 2008; Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk, & Zadrozny, 1988, 1999, 2007; Tapia García et al., 2012; Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata, & Chiclana, 2005; Kacprzyk & Fedrizzi, 1989; Kacprzyk et al., 1997; Parreiras, Ekel, & Morais, 2012; Xu, Wu, & Zhang, 2014; Xu, Li, & Wang, 2013; Xu & Cai, 2013). Usually, “soft” consensus degree level is computed by distance metrics such as Euclidean, Cosine and Jaccard distance functions. Recently, Chiclana et al. (2013) prove that different distance functions have significantly different effects on the speed of achieving consensus by exploring a statistical comparative method.The optimization consensus modeling is based on the assumption that there exists an optimum consensus opinion such that deviations between this opinion and individual DMs’ opinions should be as small as possible. The aggregation model supposes that there exists a suitable aggregation operator that would be able to aggregate all the individual DMs’ opinions to the consensus opinion (Ben-Arieh & Easton, 2007; Ben-Arieh, Easton, & Evans, 2009; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Dong, Li, Xu, & Gu, 2014; Fu & Yang, 2010, 2011, 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Xu, 2009, 2012; Xu & Cai, 2011; Zhang, Dong, Xu, & Li, 2011; Zhang, Dong, & Xu, in press). Technically, consensus models are mostly constructed by using methods of optimization, and belong to the “hard” approach. However, each optimization model is constructed on the assumption that individual DMs’ opinions do not exceed a tolerated error of consensus opinion after many times of dynamically revisions and modifications (Bryson, 1996, 1997; Bryson & Joseph, 1999; Dong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., in press). It means that consensus modeling is actually a combination of “soft” and “hard” approaches.In the last few years, the rapid development of web technologies provides much more convenient platforms for larger number of users from all over the world to freely communicate, share and exchange ideas. Therefore, consensus modeling also needs to incorporate the feedback mechanism during consensus decision making: Alonso, Pérez, Cabrerizo, and Herrera-Viedma (2013) explore a novel linguistic consensus model for Web 2.0 communities, which increases the speed of consensus convergence; Pérez, Cabrerizo, Alonso, and Herrera-Viedma (2014) build up a new consensus model, which specially considers the heterogeneity of DMs; and Pérez, Wikström, Mezei, Carlsson, and Herrera-Viedma (2013) develop a consensus model by using the power of a fuzzy ontology, which deals with the psychology of negotiation. In many consensus decision making, it takes time, requires efforts, and then needs to pay cost to convince DMs to shift their opinions during the feedback process. To model this kind of consensus decision making, Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007) develop a minimum cost consensus model to obtain the optimal convergence point of all DMs: A moderator who represents the collective interest to help reach the consensus is introduced during consensus process, where he/she has been predetermined and possesses an effective leadership and strong interpersonal communication and negotiation skills (Bryson, 1996; Cabrerizo et al., 2008, 2010; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1996; Herrera-Viedma et al., 2005, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera, 2007, 2014; Mata, Martínez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Palomares et al., 2012, 2014; Pérez et al., 2013; Tapia García et al., 2012). On one hand, the moderator tries his/her best to convince most of the individuals to conform to the collective interest or value by spending all possible forms of resources, such as material, financial, human, and information. He/She always wishes that the amount of resources he/she spends is as small as possible (Ben-Arieh & Easton, 2007; Ben-Arieh et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). On the other hand, every individual DM has an eye on his/her own benefit. Each individual DM hopes that his/her opinion deserves to be particularly considered, or he/she should show the significance and value of himself/herself by playing an important role in the consensus decision making. When they have to change their opinions or they offer more useful opinions, they deserve to be compensated or to be rewarded. Each individual DM always hopes that his/her return is as big as possible. The minimum cost and the maximum return are respectively, the moderator’s optimum objective and the individual DMs’ optimum objective, and they are dual to each other mathematically, making it helpful to further explore the consensus reaching problem by considering both minimum cost and maximum return.Considering the moderator’s interest, Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007) and Ben-Arieh et al. (2009) suggest a consensus model with linear minimum cost and a consensus models with quadratic cost respectively, to obtain the optimum consensus opinion. Recently, Zhang et al. (2011) and Zhang, Dong, and Xu (2013) generalized Ben-Arieh and Easton’s work by proposing a novel consensus model with aggregation operators to obtain the maximum consensus degree under the given cost budget. However, there is few research on consensus model considering the individuals’ interests. Actually, the process of consensus reaching needs balancing both the moderator’s and the individuals’ interests. The theories of primal–dual optimal programming will help to discuss how to obtain an optimum consensus opinion by preserving the benefits of both sides.This paper discusses two kinds of consensus decision making problems by constructing primal–dual linear programming models. The first is that when all individuals are taken into account as a whole, a primal problem of minimum cost and its dual problem of maximum return for reaching the greatest consensus regarding all the individuals are developed. Secondly, when most individuals’ opinions do not exceed the tolerated error (or mathematically, in the neighborhood) of consensus opinion as suggested by the moderator, the individual DMs accept the consensus opinion but expect nothing about the return, while only a few DMs insist on their opinions unless the moderator pays more to them, this means that they accept the consensus opinion conditionally. For convenience, we suppose that there is only one individual who needs to be paid. Hence, a primal problem of minimum cost and its dual problem of maximum return for reaching the greatest consensus regarding one individual are also investigated.This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the description of our problem. Section 3 constructs the primal–dual models based on the minimum cost consensus problem and the maximum return regarding all individuals. Section 4 discusses the economic significance of the primal–dual models by introducing its dual properties and exploring their relationship. Similarly, Section 5 establishes the primal–dual models based on the minimum cost and maximum return regarding only one individual, and investigates the economic significance of these models. Section 6 builds the conditions under which these two kinds of primal–dual models have the same optimal consensus opinion. Lastly, conclusion and problems for the future research are provided in Section 7.Suppose that there are m decision makers (DMs)D={d1,…,dm}, that take part in GDM. Letoi∈Rrepresent the opinion of DMdi(i∈M={1,2,…,m}) in GDM. Without loss of generality, we always suppose thato1⩽o2⩽…⩽om. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, consensus is defined as “an opinion or position reached by a group as a whole”. This means in group decision making, the ideal state is that there exists an ideal opinionõsuch thato1=o2=…=om=õ. When such an ideal opinion is derived, we get a full and unanimous agreement or a Utopian consensus. However, according to Ness and Hoffman (1998), consensus represents “a decision that has been reached when most members of the team agree on a clear option and the few who oppose it think they have had a reasonable opportunity to influence that choice; all team members agree to support the decision”. This means that such an ideal opinion is absolute, and it is difficult to obtain, then the moderator has to suggest a relatively satisfactory opiniono′to meet the most individuals’ preferences. We call such ano′as an acceptable consensus opinion (or, simply, a consensus opinion). Firstly, we suppose thato′exists. In fact, it can be solved by a programming model constructed later: Letfi(o′)=|o′-oi|be the deviation between the opinionoiof individualdi(i∈M) and the consensus opiniono′. Obviously, the smallerfi(o′)is, the closer the individual’s opinion is to the consensus opinion. Letwidenote a unit cost that paid by the moderator to persuade individualdi(i∈M) to change his/her opinion. Thenwifi(o′)denotes the cost that paid by the moderator to persuade individualdi(i∈M). The smaller this value is, the closer the distance between the individual’s opinion and the consensus opinion, and the lower the cost to individualdi(i∈M) is.For all individuals, as they are required to present valuable opinions, they also have to dynamically adjust opinions to conform to the consensus opiniono′, and thus they deserve to gain some return according to the changeoi-o′. Letyibe the unit return expected by the individualdi, thenyi(oi-o′)denotes the total return ofdifor changing his/her opinion. For each individual, the greater the valueyi(oi-o′)is, the higher the total return is expected by the individual. We suppose that all individuals are rational, and that they only need an appropriate value of unit returnyithat will also contribute to reaching consensus. We also prove that this unit returnyiis actually a shadow price (Jensen & Bard, 2003) in an economic sense.From the viewpoint of the moderator, he/she hopes to achieve the greatest consensus while paying the minimum cost to all the individuals. And from the viewpoint of each individual, he/she expects to gain the maximum compensation for his/her changing opinions. Mathematically, these two goals are dual to each other. Next, we construct two consensus models of mathematical programming, and explore the relationship between these models.In Section 2, if we add all the costswifi(o′)paid by the moderator to persuade the individualsdi(i∈M), then we get a weighted arithmetic mean value∑i=1mwifi(o′). It denotes the total cost paid by the moderator to persuade all the individual DMs for arriving at the consensus. For the moderator, the smaller this value is, the closer the distance between individuals’ opinion and the consensus opinion, and the lower total cost to all individuals.If we add all the returnsyi(oi-o′)expected bydifor changing his/her opinion, then∑i=1myi(oi-o′)denotes the total return that all individuals expect for changing their opinions. For all these individuals, the greater the value∑i=1myi(oi-o′)is, the higher the total return expected by all individuals.Now∑i=1mwifi(o′)can be regarded as the total cost (resource) paid by the moderator to obtain a consensus. The smaller the value∑j=1mwifi(o′)is, the greater degree of consensus will be. Thus, we construct a nonlinear optimization modelP(w)under the premise that there is a consensus opinion so that the total cost to obtain the consensus is the minimum:(1)P(w):minϕ=∑i=1mwifi(o′)s.t.o′∈O(1-1)In theP(w)model, iffi(o′)=|o′-oi|,i∈M, then there must existui⩾0,vi⩾0, andui∗vi=0, such that|o′-oi|=ui+vi,o′-oi=ui-vi. In fact, if we letui=[|o′-oi|+(o′-oi)]/2,vi=[|o′-oi|-(o′-oi)]/2, then the above conditions hold. The linear programming formatLP(w)of the nonlinear modelP(w)is as follows:(2)LP(w):minϕ=∑i=1m(wiui+wivi)s.t.o′-ui+vi=oi,i∈M(2-1)o′⩾0,ui⩾0,vi⩾0,i∈M(2-2)which is called the weighted linear consensus problem.It is easy to prove that the set of feasible solutionsX‾=(o′,u1,v1,…,ui,vi,…,um,vm)Tto Model (2) is nonempty. It can also be shown that the number of basic feasible solutions of Model (2) is finite and the optimal solution to Model (2) can be solved easily (Jensen & Bard, 2003).In Model (2), the objective functionϕ=∑i=1m(wiui+wivi)can be considered to be the minimum total cost for obtaining the greatest consensus. The restriction condition (2–1) denotes the limits of the deviation between the consensus opinion and individual’s opinion. Obviously, the cost of arriving at the greatest consensus is as small as possible under the restriction conditions (2–1) and (2–2). Next, we further explore the specific meaning in economics by discussing the dual problem of Model (2). With the primal–dual theory of linear programming, the dual problem of Model (2) is as follows:(3)DLP(w):maxψ=∑i=1moiyis.t.∑i=1myi⩽0(3-1)|yi|⩽wi,i∈M(3-2)Model (3) is the dual problem of Model (2). It is easy to prove that the set of feasible solutionsY‾=(y1,…,ym)Tto Models (3) is nonempty. The number of basic feasible solutions is finite, and|yi|⩽wi(i∈M)is bounded. We would like to further mention that if there exists an optimal solutionX∗¯=(o∗,u1∗,v1∗,…,ui∗,vi∗,…,um∗,vm∗)T, to Model (2), then obviouslyo∗>0. Based on the complementary slackness property (Jensen & Bard, 2003) of dual linear programming theory, the equality of restriction condition (3–1) holds, that is, the condition∑i=1myi=0holds. Thus, the objective function of Model (3) is equivalent to∑i=1nyioi=∑i=1nyi(oi-o∗)and Model (3) is equivalent to(4)DLP(w):maxψ=∑i=1myi(oi-o∗)s.t.∑i=1myi=0(4-1)|yi|⩽wi,i∈M(4-2)We call Model (2) the primary problem (LP(w)), and Model (4) the dual problem (DLP(w)).In Model (4), the variable|yi|indicates the unit return (profit) that individualdiexpects to obtain for changing his/her original opinion to the consensus opinion. On the basis of dual theory, the unit return is referred as a shadow value or shadow profit. We show in more detail later that ifyiis a negative value, it means that the individual’s original opinionoiis smaller than the optimal consensus opiniono∗; ifyiis a positive value, it means that the individual’s original opinionoiis larger than the consensus opiniono∗. Hence,yi<0denotes a negative unit return for the individual to change his/her opinion to consensus opinion when it is smaller than the optimal consensus opinion, whileyi>0denotes that the positive unit return for changing his/her opinion toward the consensus opinion when it is larger than the optimal consensus opinion. In Model (4), the restriction condition (4–1) can be understood as restricting the sum of all the unit returns (shadow profits) to be equal to 0; the restriction condition (4–2) can be understood as restricting the unit return|yi|paid todito not exceed the costwipaid by the moderator, or restricting the upper limit of the unit return|yi|paid todito the costwipaid by the moderator.The optimal objective functionψ=∑i=1myi(oi-o∗)is considered to be the total return that is expected by all individuals for changing their opinions toward the consensus. It is obvious that what all the individuals want is for the return to be as large as possible. The valuemaxψdenotes the maximum return of all the individuals. Because the “return” is actually a shadow price, its real meaning is referred to as the “expected return” but not the true return.Given the analysis above, the following three questions arise naturally:(4.1a)What is the relation between the maximum returnmaxψof all the individuals and the minimum costminϕof the moderator?Do the consensus opinion and the unit return (shadow profit) have practical significance (do optimal solutions of Models (2) and (4) exist)?What are the connections among the unit returnyi(i∈M), unit costwi(i∈M), the individual’s original opinionoi(i∈M) and the optimal consensus opiniono∗?In the following, the Principles of Weak Duality and Optimality Criterion (Jensen & Bard, 2003) answer Question (4.1a); the Principles of Sufficient Optimality Criterion and Strong Duality (Jensen & Bard, 2003) answer Question (4.1b); and Theorems 1–3 answer Question (4.1c).Let X be a primal feasible solution of the primal problemLP(w), andϕ(X)the corresponding value of the primal function that is to be minimized. Let Y be a dual feasible solution of the dual problemDLP(w), and letψ(Y)the corresponding value of the dual function that is to be maximized. Then the objective valueϕ(X)for a feasible solution to the primal problemLP(w)will always be larger than or equal to the objective valueψ(Y)for a feasible solution to the dual problemDLP(w). That is,ϕ(X)⩾ψ(Y).The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Weak Duality is that the total returnψexpected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions is less than or equal to the costϕpaid by the moderator for reaching a consensus. That is, the cost the moderator incurs can sufficiently satisfy the total demand all the individuals collectively claim, where we suppose that all individual DMs are relatively rational and do not claim more than they expect. Clearly, this conclusion holds in many real-life situations.If both the primal problemLP(w)and the dual problemDLP(w)have optimal feasible solutions, then the two optimal objective values are equal. That is,Maxψ=Minϕ.The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Optimality Criterion is that the total returnMaxψexpected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions equals the costMinϕpaid by the moderator for reaching a consensus. In other words, the optimal result of reaching consensus is that all the individuals obtain the maximum return that they expect, while the moderator pays the minimum resources that he/she is prepared to pay.IfX‾∗andY‾∗are feasible solutions to the primal problemLP(w)and its dual problemDLP(w), respectively, and if the primal objective function∑i=1mwi(ui+vi)and the dual objective function∑i=1m(oi-o∗)yi∗satisfy∑i=1mwi(ui∗+vi∗)=∑i=1m(oi-o∗)yi∗, thenX‾∗andY‾∗are the optimal solutions toLP(w)andDLP(w), respectively.The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Sufficient Optimality Criterion is that if the total returnMaxψexpected by all individual DMs for changing their opinions is equal to the costMinϕpaid by the moderator for reaching a consensus, then the consensus opinion and the unit return (shadow profit) have practical economic meaning (optimal solutions exist), or the economic meaning can be interpreted.If either the primal problemLP(w)or the dual problemDLP(w)has an optimal feasible solution, then so does the other problem and the two optimal objective values are equal. That is,Maxψ=Minϕ.The economic meaning implied in the Principle of Strong Duality is that.•once a consensus is reached (i.e., the optimal solution of the primal problem exists and hence the consensus opinion exists), the unit returns expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions have economic meaning (the shadow profit exists);if the unit returns expected by all individual DMs for changing their opinions are solved (i.e., the optimal solution to the dual problem exists and hence the shadow profit exists), then the optimal solution to the primal problem exists and hence consensus has been reached and vice versa;as long as either the unit return or the consensus opinion has been solved, the total return expected by all the individual DMs for changing their opinions is equal to the cost paid by the moderator for reaching the consensus.Let us now look at an example that further interprets the relationship between the primal problem Model (2) and its dual problem Model (4). The data are originated from the reference by Ben-Arieh et al. (2009).Example 1Suppose there are four DMsd1,d2,d3andd4in a GDM and their corresponding opinions areo1=0,o2=3,o3=6ando4=10, respectively. We also suppose that the unit cost paid to the four DMs by the moderator arew1=1,w2=2,w3=3andw4=1, respectively, and the consensus opinion is supposed to beo′. The optimal consensus decision making model based on minimum cost is constructed as follows:(5)P(w1):minϕ=1∗|o′-0|+2∗|o′-3|+3∗|o′-6|+1∗|o′-10|s.t.o′∈O(5–1)The unique solutiono∗=6to Model (5) can be solved easily. By letting|o′-oi|=ui+vi,o′-oi=ui-vi,i=1,2,3,4. Model (5) is equivalent to the following linear programming model:(6)LP(w1):minϕ=u1+v1+2u2+2v2+3u3+3v3+u4+v4s.t.o′-u1+v1=0o′-u2+v2=3o′-u3+v3=6o′-u4+v4=10(6-1)o′∈O,ui,vi⩾0,i=1,2,3,4(6–2)The unique solution to Model (6) isX‾∗=(660300004)T, and the optimal value of the objective function of Model (6) isminϕ=16, which means that the total cost paid by the moderator is 16. Obviously, the optimal consensus opiniono∗to Model (6) iso∗=6. Then the deviation between 4 individuals’ opinions and the consensus opinion areo1-o∗=-6,o2-o∗=-3,o3-o∗=0ando4-o∗=4, respectively.The dual problem of Model (6) is(7)DLP(w1):maxψ=3y2+6y3+10y4-6(y1+y2+y3+y4)s.t.y1+y2+y3+y4=0(7-1)|y1|⩽1|y2|⩽2|y3|⩽3|y4|⩽1(7-2)Model (7) also has a unique solutionY‾∗=(−1 −2 2 1)T, and its optimal objection ismaxψ=16. This means that the unit return by 4 individual DMs are respectivelyy1=-1,y2=-2,y3=2andy4=1, and the total return expected by all these individuals are 16. The total maximum return obtained by Model (7) is equal to the total minimum compensation obtained from Model (6). In model (6), the opinions of the first and second DMs are both smaller than the consensus opinion 6. So, the corresponding unit returns or shadow price (y1=-1andy2=-2) of the individuald1andd2are both negative; while the opinions of the third and fourth DMs are equal or greater than the consensus opinion 6, respectively. So, the corresponding unit returns or shadow prices (y3=2andy4=1) of the individuald3andd4are both positive.Next, we will construct a sufficient and necessary condition under which the unit return or shadow price|yi|expected by individualdiis equal to the unit cost or compensationwipaid by moderator to the individualdi. That is, ifo∗is the optimal solution toLP(w), and if there exist at0∈Msuch thatot0⩽o∗⩽ot0+1, and(8)∑i=1t0wi=∑j=t0+1mwjif and only ifDLP(w)have optimal solutions, and one of the optimal solutions is(-w1,…,-wt0,wt0+1,…,wm)T.Proof. For the reason thato∗is the optimal solution to primal problemLP(w), there must exist at0∈Msuch thatot0⩽o∗⩽ot0+1. Without loss of generality, we suppose thato1⩽o2⩽⋯⩽om. Obviously, there must exist at∈Msuch thatot⩽o∗⩽ot+1. Otherwise,•If0<o∗<otholds true for allot(t∈M), then there must exist ano∗∗such that0<o∗<o∗∗<ot. So, we have|ot-o∗∗|<|ot-o∗|, and∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗∗|<∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗|, which contradicts the hypothesis thato∗is the optimal solution toLP(w)problem.Ifo∗>otholds true for allot(t∈M), then there must exist ano∗∗, such thato∗>o∗∗>ot. Obviously, we have|ot-o∗∗|<|ot-o∗|, and∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗∗|<∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗|. which also contradicts the hypothesis thato∗is the optimal solution toLP(w)problem.The objective function ofLP(w)attains its minimum ono∗, and its minimum value satisfiesminϕ=∑i=1mwi|oi-o∗|=∑i=1t0wi(o∗-oi)+∑j=t0+1mwj(oj-o∗)=∑i=1t0wi-∑j=t0+1mwjo∗+-∑i=1t0wioi+∑j=t0+1mwjojWhen condition (8) holds true, the minimum value ofLP(w)isminϕ=-∑i=1t0wioi+∑j=t0+1mwjoj.According to the Principle of Strong Duality, there must exist an optimal solution toDLP(w)which can be obtained by letting(9)yi=-wi,i=1,2,…,t0;yj=wj,j=t0+1,…,mCondition (9) which satisfies the restrictions (3–1) and (3–2), means that it is a feasible solution to the dual problemDLP(w). Letyi∗(i∈M)be an optimal solution to the dual problemDLP(w), then we have-∑i=1t0wioi+∑j=t0+1mwjoj⩽∑i=1moiyi∗. According to Principle of the Weak Duality Theory, we have∑i=1moiyi∗⩽-∑i=1t0wioi+∑j=t0+1mwjoj. Thus,-∑i=1t0wioi+∑j=t0+1mwjoj=∑i=1moiyi∗. That is, Eq. (9) is an optimal solution toDLP(w).It is easy to prove that the proof process above is reversible. This leads to Theorem 1.Theorem 1Suppose that the individual DMs’ opinions satisfyo1⩽…⩽oi⩽…⩽om. Ifo∗is the optimal solution to the primal problemLP(w), then there must exist at0∈Msuch thatot0⩽o∗⩽ot0+1, and(10)∑i=1t0wi=∑j=t0+1mwjif and only ifDLP(w)have optimal solutions, and one of the optimal solution is(-w1,…,-wt0,wt0+1,…,wm)T.Aiming at problem (4.1c) above, Theorem 1 actually presents a sufficient and necessary condition that an individual DM’s unit return or shadow profit is equal to the real unit compensation paid by the moderator. That is, when the sum of one part of individual DMs’ unit returns is exactly equal to the sum of the rest part of individual DMs’ unit returns, the unit return or shadow price|yi|expected by individualdifor abandoning his/her own original opinion is equal to the unit cost or compensationwithat would be paid by the moderator to individualdi.Theorem 2The statementyi=-wi<0holds wheno∗>oiholds; andyi=wi>0holds wheno∗<oiholds. This denotes|yi|=wiholds wheno∗≠oiholds;-wi⩽yi⩽wiholds wheno∗=oiholds.Ifo∗>oi, theno∗-oi=ui-vi>0, andui>vi. For the reason thatui⩾0,vi⩾0,ui∗vi=0, we havevi=0,ui>0. According to the principle of complementary slackness, we haveyi=-wi; Likewise, ifo∗<oi, we haveyi=wi>0; ifo∗=oiholds true, we also have-wi⩽yi⩽wi.□Theorem 2 implies that when the consensus opinion is greater than an individual DM’s opinion, then the value of the expected unit return of this individual DM is negative; and when the consensus opinion is lower than an individual DM’s opinion, the value of the expected unit return of this individual DM is positive. Under these two circumstances, the absolute value of the expected unit return of the individual DM must be equal to the real compensation paid to him/her.Theorem 2 actually presents a condition under which a unit return expected by an individual DM is equal to a unit compensation paid by the moderator. Thus we have the following corollary.Corollary 1Ifo∗∉{o1,…,om}, then|yi|=wihold for alli∈M.This result means that if the optimization solution toLP(w)is not equal to any of the individual DMs’ opinions, then the moderator has to pay more effort and cost to persuade the individuals to change their opinions. And only when the individual DMs’ expected unit returns|yi|attains the upper limit value of the shadow profitwi(|yi|=wi,i∈M), does the optimal consensus opinion solve.The statemento∗⩽oiholds whenyi=wi;o∗⩾oiholds whenyi=-wi; ando∗=oiholds when-wi<yi<wi.Ifyi=wi, then there must be-yi<wi. According to the principle of complementary slackness, we haveui=0, and thuso∗=oi-vi⩽oi; Ifyi=-wi, then there must beyi<wi. According to the principle of complementary slackness, we havevi=0, and thuso∗=oi+vi⩾oi; If-wi<yi<wi, we haveui=vi=0according to the principle of complementary slackness, and thus we haveo∗=oi.□Theorem 3 indicates that if an individual DM’s expected unit return is lower than the real unit compensation paid by the moderator, the individual DM’s opinion must be equal to the consensus opinion. This result actually provides a condition under which an individual DM’s opinion is exactly equal to the consensus opinion.In some group decision making, the moderator proposes a relatively ideal opinion after many rounds of negotiation and communication. But he/she has to consider the following two cases:(i)Most individual DMs feel that the moderator’s opinion is within the deviation limits of their own opinions. So they are happy to accept this opinion. And the moderator does not need to pay out any compensation. Mathematically, there exists an allowed deviationεj, such that the deviationfj(o′)between the opinion of the moderator and the opinion of the j-th individual DM satisfiesfj(o′)⩽εj. In this case, we also say that opinionojis acceptable.Only a few individual DMs insist on their opinions because they perceive that there exist divergences between their opinions and the moderator’s opinion. So the moderator has to make additional effort to persuade these individuals to accept his/her opinion. Mathematically, the moderator pays individual DMdkan amountrkfk(o′)of compensation according to the deviationfk(o′)=|ok-o′|between the moderator’s opinion and the k-th individual DM’s opinion, whererkis the unit compensation paid to individualdkby the moderator.In this section, we will discuss a consensus model based on the minimum cost of the k-th individual DM.For the sake of convenience of communication, all the individual DMs’ opinions are acceptable except for the individual DMdk. From the viewpoint of the moderator, on the one hand, he/she hopes that the smaller the value offk(o′)=|ok-o′|is, the closer the deviation betweeno′andok, and the lower the total compensationrkfk(o′)that needs to be paid according to the value of the unit costrkand the value of deviationfk(o′). On the other hand, the moderator does not need to pay any compensations if the moderator’s opiniono′is allowed in the deviation limits of the most individual DMs’ opinions. I.e., the restriction conditionsfj(o′)⩽εjhold for allj∈M,j≠k.Thus, a nonlinear programming modelPk(ε)is constructed as follows, where its objective function satisfies that the total compensationrkfk(o′)is as small as possible, and the restriction conditionfj(o′)is limited within the allowed deviationεj,j∈M,i≠k.(11)Pk(ε):minZ=rkfk(o′)s.t.o′∈O(11–1)fj(o′)⩽εj,j∈M,j≠k(11–2)InPk(ε)Model, forfk(o′)=|o′-ok|,k=1,2,…,m, there existuk⩾0,vk⩾0such thatuk∗vk=0, and|o′-ok|=uk+vk,o′-ok=uk-vk. In fact, by lettinguk=[|o′-ok|+(o′-ok)]/2,vk=[|o′-ok|-(o′-ok)]/2, the above conditions hold true.Pk(ε)is equivalent to the following linear programming modelLPk(ε):(12)LPk(ε):minZ=rkuk+rkvks.t.o′∈O(12–1)o′⩽oj+εj,j∈M,j≠k(12–2)o′⩾oj-εj,j∈M,j≠k(12–3)o′-uk+vk=ok(12–4)o′⩾0,uk⩾0,vk⩾0(12–5)Let’s reconsider the feasible field of model (12). For allj∈M,j≠k, there must exists,t∈M,s≠k,t≠k, such that the set{o′|o′⩽oj+εj,o′⩾oj-εj,j∈M,j≠k}is equal to the set{o′|o′⩽ot+εt,o′⩾os-εs,s,t∈M,s≠k,t≠k},whereot+εt=min{oj+εj|j∈M,j≠k},os-εs=max{oj-εj|j∈M,j≠k}.Therefore, model (12) can be further simplified into(13)LPk(ε):minZ=rkuk+rkvks.t.o′∈O(13–1)o′⩽ot+εt,t∈M,t≠k(13–2)o′⩾os-εs,s∈M,s≠k(13–3)o′-uk+vk=ok(13–4)o′⩾0,uk⩾0,vk⩾0(13–5)According to the theory of linear programming, the dual problem of Model (13) is given as follows:(14)DLPk(ε):maxS=(os-εs)xs-(ot+εt)xt+okxks.t.xs-xt+xk⩽0(14–1)-xk⩽rk(14–2)xk⩽rk(14–3)xs,xt,xk⩾0(14–4)Suppose that the optimal solutionX∗=(o∗uk∗vk∗)Tto the primal problem (13) exists. Then there must beo∗>0. According to the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual linear programming, Model (14) must have its optimal solution, and the equality of its restrict conditionxs-xt+xk⩽0holds true, that is,(15)xs-xt+xk=0We next discuss the economic meaning of Model (14) by simplifying its objective function. According to the principle of complementary slackness, the restriction conditions (13–2) and (13–3) are helpful to simplify the dual Model (14). Suppose that the optimal solutionX∗=(o∗uk∗vk∗)Tto the primal problem (13) exists, then the optimal solution to the dual problem (14) also exists according to the Sufficient Optimality Criterion of the primal–dual linear programming problem (As proved in next section).(i)If the restriction conditions satisfyo∗<ot+εt,o∗>os-εs, then its dual variables satisfyxs=xt=0. From Eq. (15), it follows thatxk=0. Thus, the optimal objective function of the dual problem (14) is equivalent toS=0.If the restriction conditions satisfyo∗=ot+εt,o∗>os-εs, then its dual variables satisfyxs=0. And so, Eq. (15) is equivalent to-xt+xk=0. Thus, the optimal objective function of the dual problem (14) is equivalent toS=(ok-ot-εt)xk=(ok-o∗)xk.If the restriction conditions satisfyo∗<ot+εt,o∗=os-εs, then its dual variables satisfyxt=0. Then Eq. (15) is equivalent toxs+xk=0. Thus, the optimal objective function of dual problem (14) is equivalent toS=(ok-os+εs)xk=(ok-o∗)xk.If the restriction conditions satisfyo∗=ot+εt,o∗=os-εs, then we haveot+εt=os-εs. Thus, the optimal objective function of the dual problem (14) is equivalent toS=o∗xs-o∗xt+xkok=(ok-o∗)xk.In case (i), forxk=0, we have that the inequalities of restriction conditions (14–2) and (14–3) in the dual problem (14) hold true. According to the principle of complementary slackness, the restriction conditions(13-4)in primal problem (13) is equivalent too∗=ok. Therefore, the optimal objective function in dual problem is equivalent toS=(ok-o∗)xk.This leads to the following result.Theorem 4The equation(os-εs)xs-(ot+εt)xt+okxk=(ok-o∗)xkalways holds true under the condition that the objective function in Model(14)attains its maximum value.Given all that, Model(14)is equivalent to(16)DLPk(ε):maxS=(ok-o′)xks.t.xs-xt+xk=0(16–1)-xk⩽rk(16–2)xk⩽rk(16–3)xs,xt,xk⩾0(16–4)If the primal Model(13)has its optimization solution, then its dual Models(14)and(16)are equivalent.The economic meaning of Model (16) is given as follows: In GDM, the individual DMdkmay insist on his/her opinion, or may care about him/her being recognized as serious. However, he/she has to sacrifice his/her interests to get closer to the moderator’s opinion. So the moderator needs to compensate for his/her loss. From the viewpoint of the individual DMdk, he/she expects the maximum compensation from the moderator. In model (16), the meaning of the variablexkcan be understood as a unit return (profit) expected by the individual DMdkfor changing his/her original opinion. According to the primal–dual linear programming theory,xkis actually a shadow price or profit.In Model (16), the restriction condition (16–1) can be understood as restricting the sum of all the unit returns (shadow profits) to be equal to 0; the restriction conditions (16–2) and (16–3) can be understood as restricting the unit return|xk|paid todkto not exceed the costrkpaid by the moderator, or restricting the upper limit of the unit return|xk|paid todkto the costrkfrom the moderator. The optimal objective functionmaxS=(ok-o′)xkcan be considered as the maximum compensation expected by the individual DMdkaccording to the product of the shadow profit and the deviation betweeno′andok.Given the analysis of Section 5.1, the following three questions arise naturally:(5.2a)What is the relation between the maximum returnmaxSof the individual DMdkand the minimum costminZpaid to him/her by the moderator?Do the consensus opinion and the unit return (shadow profit) have practical significance (do optimal solutions of Models (13) and (14) exist)?What are the connections among the unit returnxk, unit costrk, the k-th individual DM’s opinionok, and the optimal consensus opiniono∗?In the following, the Principles of Weak Duality and Optimality Criterion (Jensen & Bard, 2003) answer Question (5.2a); the Principles of Sufficient Optimality Criterion and Strong Duality (Jensen & Bard, 2003) address Question (5.2b) (where we omit the explanation of economic meanings of theses principles); and Theorems 5 considers Question (5.2c).Let X be a primal feasible solution of the primal problemLPk(ε), andZ(X)the corresponding value of the primal function that is to be minimized. Let Y be a dual feasible solution of the dual problemDLPk(ε), andS(Y)the corresponding value of the dual function that is to be maximized. Then the objective valueZ(X)for a feasible solution to the primal problemLPk(ε)will always be larger than or equal to the objective valueS(Y)for a feasible solution to the dual problemDLPk(ε). That is,S(Y)⩽Z(X).If both the primal problemLPk(ε)and the dual problemDLPk(ε)have optimal feasible solutions, then the two optimal objective values are equal. That is,MaxS=MinZ.IfX^∗=(o∗,uk∗,vk∗)TandY^∗=(xs∗,xt∗,xk∗)Tare feasible solutions to the primal problemLPk(ε)and its dual problemDLPk(ε), respectively, and if the primal objective functionrkuk+rkvkand the dual objective function(ok-o∗)rksatisfyrkuk∗+rkvk∗=(ok-o∗)rk∗, thenX^∗andY^∗are the optimal solutions toLPk(ε)andDLPk(ε), respectively.If either the primal problemLPk(ε)or the dual problemDLPk(ε)has an optimal feasible solution, then so does the other problem and the two optimal objective values are equal. That is,MaxS=MinZ.According to the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual problem, the following Theorem 5 can be easily established.Theorem 5If bothLPk(ε)andDLPk(ε)have their optimization solutions, then the relation between the unit return or the shadow profitxkexpected bydkand the compensationrkpaid by the moderator is given as follows:(i)xs-xt+xk=0holds true.xk=-rk<0holds true wheno∗>ok;xk=rk>0holds true wheno∗<ok. This denotes that|xk|=rkholds wheno∗≠ok.o∗=okholds true when|xk|<rk.The details are similar to those given in the proof of Theorem 2, and are omitted here.□Theorem 5 (ii) indicates that, when the consensus opinion is greater than the k-th individual DM’s opinion, the value of the unit return or shadow profit expected bydkis negative; when the consensus opinion is lower than the k-th individual DM’s opinion, the value of unit return or shadow profit expected bydkis positive. In either of these cases, the absolute value of unit return or shadow profit expected bydkmust be equal to the real unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator. This can also be understood as the reason thatdkhas to modify his/her opinionokinto the consensus opiniono∗, so he/she expects the greatest unit return or shadow profit|xk|=rk.Theorem 5 (iii) indicates that, when the unit return or shadow profit expected bydkis lower than the real unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator, the k-th individual DM’s opinion must be equal to the consensus opinion. This can also be understood as the reason whydkis willing to accept his/her unit return or shadow profit lower than the unit cost or compensationrk, because his/her opinion is identical to that of the moderator’s.This section presents a numerical example to show the relationship between the primal model (12) and its dual model (16) and the validity of the theoretical analysis of Theorem 5.Example 2Suppose that there are four DMsd1,d2,d3,d4in a GDM and their corresponding opinions areo1=0,o2=3,o3=6ando4=10, respectively. Except for the third individual, the allowed deviations of the opinions of other three DMs areε1=5,ε2=4,ε4=6, respectively. We also suppose that the unit cost paid to the third individual by the moderator isw3=3and the consensus opinion is supposed to beo′. The optimal consensus decision making model based on minimum cost is constructed as follows:(17)P(w2):minZ=3∗|o′-6|s.t.|o′|⩽5(17–1)|o′-3|⩽4(17–2)|o′-10|⩽6(17–3)o′⩾0(17–4)By letting|o′-6|=u3+v3ando′-6=u3-v3, Model (17) can be transformed into the following linear programming model:(18)LPk(ε2):minZ=3u3+3v3s.t.4⩽o′⩽5(18–1)o′-u3+v3=6(18–2)o′⩾0,u3⩾0,v3⩾0(18–3)Model (18) has the unique solutionX‾∗=(501)T, and its minimum objective function isminZ=3. So, the consensus opinion solved from Model (18) iso∗=5, and the deviations between the consensus opinion and the four individuals’ opinions are respectivelyo∗-o1=5,o∗-o2=2,o3-o∗=1ando4-o∗=5. The total cost paid by the moderator for arriving at the consensus is 3.The dual model of the primal Model (18) is(19)DLPk(ε2):maxS=4x4-5x1+6x3s.t.x4-x1+x3=0(19–1)-x3⩽3(19–2)x3⩽3(19–3)x1,x4⩾0(19–4)Model (19) also has the unique solutionY‾∗=(330)T, and its maximum objective function ismaxS=3. The third individual’s unit return and total compensation isx3=3andS=3. The total return expected by the third individual is equal to the total compensation paid by the moderator. The opiniono3=6of the third individual is greater than the consensus opiniono∗=5. The unit return or the shadow profit expected by the third individual is equal to the compensation paid by the moderator (x3=w3=3).BothP(w)model andPk(ε)model may be solved for different optimal consensus opinions. Next, let us explore the conditions under which the optimal consensus opinions solved out of these two models are the same.InPk(ε)Model (11), for a given pointo∗, we use the symbolPk(ε∗)to represent the problemPk(ε), whereεj=εj∗=fj(o∗),j∈M,j≠k.Theorem 6(Vira & Haimes, 1983)For any given k, leto∗be the optimal consensus opinion solved out ofPk(ε∗). Then there existsw∗∈W,w∗⩾0, such thato∗is also the optimal consensus opinion solved out ofP(w∗).If there existsw∈Wsuch thato∗is the optimization solution toP(w), then either(1)or(2)of the following holds true:(1)ifwk>0, theno∗is also the optimization solution toPk(ε∗);ifo∗is the unique optimization solution toP(w), theno∗is also the optimization solution toPk(ε∗), for allk,k∈M.Leto∗be the optimization solution toP(w)for somew∈W. Then, for allo′∈O, we have(20)∑j=1mwj[fj(o′)-fj(o∗)]⩾0(1) Suppose thato∗is not the optimization solution toPk(ε∗), then there exists anoˇ∈Osuch thatfk(oˇ)<fk(o∗), andfj(oˇ)⩽fj(o∗),j≠k. Sincewk>0, by the hypothesis andwj⩾0,j∈M,j≠k, we havewk[fk(oˇ)-fk(o∗)]+∑j≠kwj[fk(oˇ)-fj(o∗)]<0which contradicts inequality (20). Therefore,o∗is also the optimization solution toPk(ε∗).(2) Suppose thato∗is the unique optimization solution toP(w). Then for allo′∈O,o′≠o∗, we have(21)∑j=1mwj[fj(o′)-fj(o∗)]>0Assume that there exists a k such thato∗is not the optimization solution toPk(ε). Then there must existo¯′, satisfyingo¯′≠o∗, such thatfk(o¯′)<fk(o∗), andfj(o¯′)⩽fj(o∗),j∈M,j≠k. Thus we have∑j=1mwj[fj(o¯′)-fj(o∗)]=∑j=1,j≠kmwj[fj(o¯′)-fj(o∗)]+wk[fk(o¯′)-fk(o∗)]<0, which contradicts inequality (21). Therefore, for allk,k∈M,o∗is the optimization solution toPk(ε∗).□Assume that there exists an optimal solutiono∗toLP(w), and the restriction conditions ofLPk(ε)attain the upper limitationsεj=|o∗-oj|,j∈M,j≠kThen for allj∈M,o∗must be the unique optimal solution toLPk(ε).Proof. Assume thato∗is an optimal solution toLP(w), and the restriction conditions ofLPk(ε)attain the upper limitationsεj=|o∗-oj|(j∈M,j≠k). Without loss of generality, we assumeo1⩽o2⩽⋯⩽om. Obviously, there must existt∈M, such thatot⩽o∗⩽ot+1. Otherwise,•If0<o∗<otfor allot(t∈M), then there must exist ano∗∗such that0<o∗<o∗∗<ot. Clearly, we have|ot-o∗∗|<|ot-o∗|, and∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗∗|<∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗|, which contradicts the assumption.Ifo∗>otfor allot(t∈M), then there must exist ano∗∗such thato∗>o∗∗>ot. Obviously, we have|ot-o∗∗|<|ot-o∗|and∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗∗|<∑t=1mwt|ot-o∗|, which contradict the assumption.Leto′be a feasible solution toLPk(ε). Then when|o′-oj|⩽o∗-ojfor allj=1,2,…,t, we have2oj-o∗⩽o′⩽o∗; and when|o′-oj|⩽oj-o∗for allj=t+1,t+2,…,m, we haveo∗⩽o′⩽2oj-o∗. Thus we haveo′=o∗. So,LPk(ε)has a unique feasible solution, which is also the unique optimal solution toLPk(ε).□Obviously, the condition of Theorem 8 is more relaxed than that of Theorem 7.A kind of consensus model regarding all individual DMs and a kind of consensus model regarding only one individual DM have been investigated in this paper: A minimum cost primal model and its dual model – a maximum return model for reaching greatest consensus – have been developed from the standpoint of all the individual DMs. Our results show that once a consensus is arrived at, the maximum return expected by all the individual DMs for changing their original opinions and the minimum cost paid by the moderator for persuading all individual DMs to accept the consensus opinion are equal; the existence of optimization solutions to the primal–dual models with all individual DMs implicates that both the consensus opinion and the shadow profits have economic significance. The optimality criterion and the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual models clarify the interrelation between the unit return or shadow profit expected by each individual DM and the unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator.Anεrestriction problemPk(ε)based on the minimum cost with a particular individual DM and its dual problem have also been explored from the standpoint of the particular individual DM. It is proven that once a consensus is arrived at, the maximum return expected by the particular individual DM for changing his/her original opinion and the minimum cost paid by the moderator for persuading this DM to accept the consensus opinion are equal; the existence of optimization solutions to the primal–dual models with respect to the particular individual DM explains that both the consensus opinion and the shadow profit have economic significance. The optimality criterion and the principle of complementary slackness of the primal–dual models with a particular individual expound the interrelation between the unit return or shadow profit expected by the particular individual DM and the unit cost or compensation paid by the moderator. The close interrelation between these two kinds of consensus models is also investigated, showing that when certain conditions met, the optimal consensus opinions derived by these two models are identical.This paper focuses on the cost model of consensus reaching. In our consensus models, distance measure can more intuitionally reflect the deviation between the individual DMs’ opinions and the consensus opinion. The equivalent linear programming model transformed by nonlinear programming modelP(w)(Ben-Arieh et al., 2009) has two merits: It is easier to get the optimal solution of a linear programming than that of a nonlinear programming; It is more convenient to analyze the economic significance of the primal–dual linear programming models. That is, we can not only build up relation between the minimum cost paid by the moderator and the maximum return expected by the individuals, but also explore the relation between the consensus opinion, the individual opinion, the shadow profit expected by the individual, and the unit cost paid by the moderator. In a word, the economic analysis of our primal–dual linear programming model considers both sides of the interests: the moderator’s cost and the individuals’ return, so it conforms to the process of practical consensus reaching.However, consensus reaching is so complex in many GDM that a simple model can not fully simulate the whole process of consensus. Consensus reaching consists of different stages, and the individual DMs’ opinions may change gradually during each stage. Obtaining a satisfied consensus needs to consider different stages and different conditions of consensus decision making, the teams of Herrera-Viedma et al. (Alonso et al., 2013; Chiclana et al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2013, 2014) have done a series work on consensus in GDM, consensus measures, consensus and fuzzy ontologies, consensus software tools, and etc. In the future, we will construct a dynamic cost model to simulate the process of consensus reaching.
