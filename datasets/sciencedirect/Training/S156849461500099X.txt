@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new disturbance detection and classification technique based on modified Adaline and adaptive neuro-fuzzy information system (ANFIS) is proposed for a distributed generation system comprising a wind power generating system (DFIG) and a photovoltaic array. The proposed technique is based on a fast Gauss–Newton parameter updating rule rather than the conventional Widrow–Hoff delta rule for the Adaline network. The voltage and current signals near the target distributed generation (DG), particularly the DFIG, whose speed varies from minimum to the maximum cut-off speed, are processed through the modified Adaline network to yield the features like the negative sequence power, harmonic amplification factor (HAF), total harmonic distortion (THD), etc. These features are then used as training sets for the ANFIS, which employs a gradient descent algorithm to update its parameters. The proposed technique distinguishes the islanding condition of the distributed generation system with some other disturbances, such as switching faults, capacitor bank switching, voltage swell, voltage sag, distorted grid voltage, unbalanced load switching, etc. which are referred to as non-islanding cases in this paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Increased demand for electricity has necessitated the larger penetration of renewable energy sources to the power grid. Until the time, DG is supplying generated power to the network loads along with the utility, it is considered to be in a safer condition. On the contrary, if the DG is supplying power to loads (local loads), in the absence of the utility (which is considered as islanding condition according to the IEEE std. 1547.1), several negative impacts are produced on the utility power system as well as the DG. In addition to this, the switching events such as capacitor bank switching, load switching, fault switching, etc., are mostly unintentional and have a great impact on the power systems. Some of the hazards may be related to safety personnel's of the utility and public, quality of power fed to the consumers, damage to the DG if the utility is restored in a wrong manner [1,2], lack of grounding, change in the fault power, reclosing due to out of phase, voltage and frequency control [1,3,4], etc. Therefore it is most important task of any disturbance detection technique, primarily to quickly detect the occurrence of the disturbance and then to correctly classify the nature of the disturbance.Disturbance (islanding and non-islanding) detection techniques [3–10] are broadly classified into active and passive methods. Active methods concentrate on the injection of a small disturbance into the power system and then monitoring its response. On the contrary, passive methods concentrate on the measurement of local parameters of the power system and setting some threshold for these parameters based on the measured values. As a matter of fact souvenired from the literature survey, it reveals that on a generalized aim to condense the effect of the non-detection zone, various methods have already been proposed. For instance, some of the latest active islanding detection schemes such as signal injection at elevated frequencies [28], methods based on positive-feedbacks [29], passive Bayesians [30], etc. have proven to have localized the non-detection zones, but only for the inverter based DG's [24]. In contrast, techniques based on fuzzy rule base [20], decision tree [31], and pattern recognition [25,32] have been incorporated for the synchronous-based DG's. Several passive methods such as voltage/current thresholds [33], rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) [21–23], rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) [21,22,26], change in frequency [20], harmonic assessment based methods [15,18], etc. can be addressed from the literature, which are very much convenient for utilization in DG networks, but again at a cost of increased non-detection zones.In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence techniques, artificial neural networks and Adalines[11,18,19] have been used for tracking time varying harmonics buried in noise. The Adaline structure as shown in Fig. 1, also known as a linear combiner, is preferred due to its simple structure and ease of computation in comparison to other known and widely used techniques. Therefore, it is preferred as a real-time computational approach for the estimation of fundamental and harmonic phasors in power networks. However, one of the drawbacks in the earlier least mean square (LMS) based learning algorithms is the tracking error, introduced due to the non-stationary nature of the signal, i.e. sudden changes in frequency, phase and amplitude of the fundamental and harmonic components, and the presence of noise in the power signal. This paper, therefore, presents a modified Adaline structure, where the parameters are estimated by minimizing a weighted squared error cost function. Instead of conventional improved Widrow–Hoff rule, the unknown parameters are updated by a recursive Newton-type algorithm weighted by a variable forgetting factor. The technique proposed in this paper is classified as a new passive islanding detection method based on the modified Adaline [11], that uses a fast Gauss–Newton recursive weight updating rule (GNADA) [27] and adaptive neuro-fuzzy information system (ANFIS). It is to be noted that an analogous Gauss–Newton approach has already been investigated in [27], but suffers from inaccuracies as the fundamental frequency estimation does not take into account a frequency correction factor that is associated with the changing forgetting factor. Therefore, the earlier technique has been modified in the present paper to make the computation of frequency and phasors more accurate and robust for islanding detection in distributed generation systems.The proposed method is very efficient in accurately classifying the various disturbances such as islanding and non-islanding (i.e. capacitor bank switching, unbalanced load switching, fault switching, etc.), even with a very large variation of wind speed and active power mismatch with a very high classification accuracy as compared to some of the traditional techniques. The paper is organized in ten sections. Apart from the introduction in Section 1, the description of the system under study has been done in Section 2. In Section 3, the proposed hybrid Gauss–Newton linear combiner (HGNLC) algorithm is described for target feature extraction. Section 4 presents the computer simulation results showing clearly the impact of wide range of variation of wind speed and active power mismatch on the various parameters like the HAFi, HAFv, THDi, THDv, and negative sequence power (NSP) at the target DG terminals, particularly for the DFIG based wind power generating system. Section 5 is dedicated to describe the ANFIS training and testing procedure whereas, Section 6 describes the non-detection zone of the islanding. Section 7 describes the performance evaluation of the proposed method, and the concluding remarks are presented in Section 8.Fig. 2represents the single line diagram of the proposed system used in this paper. The basic parameters of the system are extracted from the benchmark system of the IEEE Standard 399-1997 with some modifications. The model consists of a 120kV grid, which is connected to the rest of the network through a 47MVA, 120kV/25kV transformer 1 and a 25kV line. Loads L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5 are composed of three phase RL branches. The proposed test model consists of two distributed generating units [12]. The D.G.-1 (9MVA), is a doubly fed induction generator based wind farm and D.G.-2 is a 2MVA solar farm [13], which may also consist of an adequate energy storage system. The D.G.-2 portion consists of a voltage source converter (VSC), which acts as the interfacing medium within the source and the power system. A constant PQ control strategy [14] is employed for the control of inverter present in the PV farm. All the loads and transmission lines are present on the 25kV line of the model. The parameters of various network elements in the model are given in Appendix A. The bus B4 is considered as the PCC. The last section of the network after bus B4 consists of the DG units and the loads (Loads 3–5), and this section is capable of operating in the island mode after disconnection from the main grid. The next section describes the mathematical foundations of the hybrid Gauss–Newton linear combiner, which is used to compute the various voltage and current signal parameters at the target DG terminals.In general the voltage or the current signal in discrete form can be represented as a sum of the fundamental and harmonic components superimposed with noise as:(1)z(k)=∑i=1NAi(k)sin(iω+φi)+ξ(t)where Ai, iω, and φiare the peak value, angular frequency and phase of ith harmonic component of the signal; ξ(t) stands for either white Gaussian noise or random noise with zero mean and N is the order of harmonic, and fundamental angular frequency=2πf1; f1=fundamental frequency of the signal; Ns=samples per cycle; k=sampling instant; and fs=sampling frequency, and sampling interval Ts=1/fs, and the sampling frequency fs=f1Ns.The signal given in (1) can also be expressed in discrete form as(2)z(k)=θ(k)⋅YT(k)where the state vector Y(k) and coefficient vector θ(k) are, respectively, given by(3)Y(k)=sin2πf1fskcos2πf1fsksin4πf1fskcos4πf1fsk…sin2Nπf1fskcos2Nπf1fskand(4)θ(k)=[a1b1a2b2…aNbN]The error signal used for tracking is given by(5)e(k)=d(k)−θ(k)⋅XT(k)To estimate the values of the parameters[a1b1a2b2…aNbN], an error cost function weighted by a time varying forgetting factor is used as shown in Eq. (6):(6)E(k)=12∑i=0kλk−ie2(i)and the error e(k) at the kth iteration is written in an expanded form from Eq. (5) as(7)e(k)=∑i=0kλk−iz(k)−∑n=1N(an(k−1)cos(ω(k−1)k)−bn(k−1)sin(ω(k−1)k)where 0<λ≤1 is the forgetting factor.In the above equation the forgetting factor λ controls the speed of convergence while providing a more accurate estimation of signal parameters a1, b1, a2, b2, …, an, bn.The error cost function E(k) is minimized by using a fast Gauss–Newton algorithm (GNA) by taking the gradient of E as(8)∂E(i)∂θˆ=∑i=0kλk−iψ(i)e(i)Using this gradient, it may not be optimal in minimizing the cost function and hence the second derivative or the Hessian (Newton algorithm) is used as(9)∂2E(i)∂θˆ2=∑i=0kλk−iψ(i)ψT(i)+∑i=0kλk−ie(i)∂2e(i)∂θˆ2Since the harmonic frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, the above model can be used to estimate in the first step, the fundamental, and harmonics components on the assumption that the fundamental frequency is known. The Gauss–Newton algorithm is obtained by neglecting the second term from Eq. (9) and is outlined in the following equations for the estimation of parameters of the fundamental and harmonic components (n=1 denotes the fundamental):Let the estimated parameter vectorθˆis rewritten as(10)θˆ(k)=[aˆ1(k)bˆ1(k)aˆ2(k)bˆ2(k)⋯aˆn(k)bˆn(k)]Estimated value ofθˆ(k)is obtained as(11)θ(k)=θ(k−1)+H−1(k)ψ(k)⋅e(k)and the gradient vector ψ and the Hessian matrix H are obtained as,(12)ψ(i)=∂e∂θ=[−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)…−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)]Tand(13)H(k)=∑i=0kλk−iψ(i)⋅ψT(i)The inverse of the Hessian matrix H−1(k) is obtained by using the matrix inversion lemma as,(14)H−1(k)=1λH−1(k−1)−H−1(k−1)ψ(k)ψT(k)H−1(k−1)λ+ψT(k)H−1(k−1)ψ(k)where(15)ψ(i)ψT(i)=∑i=0kλk−i[−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)…−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)]T×[−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)…−cos(ω(i−1)i)−sin(ω(i−1)i)]The Hessian matrix is obtained in a simplified form by neglecting some square terms arising out of the products of dissimilar harmonic components as(16)H=H1(k)0...000H2(k)0000.0000.0000.0000Hn−1(k)000...0Hn(k)where the Hessian matrix for the fundamental and the nth harmonic components is obtained as(17)H1(k)=∑i=0kλk−icos2ωi0.5sin2ωi0.5sin2ωisin2ωiand(18)Hn(k)=∑i=0kλk−icos2nωi0.5sin2nωi0.5sin2nωisin2nωiTo simplify the Hessian matrix expressions further, the frequency ω is assumed to be neither 0 or π and the off-diagonal terms are neglected. The simplified equations become(19)Hn(k)=∑i=0kλk−i0.5000.5=Cλ(k)1001whereCλ(k)=12∑i=1kλk−iFurther Cλ(k) can be recursively computed as:(20)Cλ(k)=λ⋅Cλ(k−1)+1The inverse of the Hessian matrix is obtained as,(21)Hn−1(k)=1Cλ(k)1001Combining Eqs. (11), (12) and (21) the following simplified decoupled equations are obtained for the fundamental and nth harmonic components.(22)a1(k)=a1(k−1)+sin(ω(k−1)k)e(k)Cλ(k)(23)b1(k)=b1(k−1)+cos(ω(k−1)k)e(k)Cλ(k)(24)an(k)=an(k−1)+sin(nω(k−1)k)e(k)Cλ(k)(25)bn(k)=bn(k−1)+cos(nω(k−1)k)e(k)Cλ(k)Thus the amplitude and phase of fundamental and harmonic components are obtained as(26)A1(k)=(a12+b12,φ1(k)=tan−1b1a1,n=1,2,3,…,NAn(k)=(an2+bn2,φn(k)=tan−1bnan,n=1,2,3,…,NThe above expressions can now be compared with a linear combiner using Adaline to yield the learning rate(27)μ(k)=1Cλ(k)To derive the above mathematical expressions for the estimation of amplitude and phase angles of the fundamental and harmonic components, an assumption of either constant or small change in power signal frequency is made. However, for large frequency changes certain corrections need to be derived for computing signal frequency iteratively. A simplified expression for the change in frequency is obtained by using the estimated values of amplitude and phase angle of the fundamental component. The error cost function is optimized using the Gauss–Newton algorithm by computing the gradient of the error and the Hessian matrix as(28)ωˆ(k)=ωˆ(k−1)+Hf−1(k)Ψf(k)⋅e(k)and the gradient vector ψ(k) and the Hessian H(k) are obtained as,(29)ψf(i)=∂e(i)∂ωˆ=∑j=1N−i(aˆjcos(jωˆ(i−1)i)−bˆjsin(jωˆ(i−1)i)(30)Hf(k)=∑i=0kλfk−iψf(i)⋅ψfT(i)(31)Hf(k)=∑i=0kλfk−i∑j=1Ni(aˆjcos(jωˆ(i−1)i)−b⌢isin(jωˆ(i−1)i)2=∑i=0kλfk−ii2∑j=1Ni(aˆjcos(jωˆ(i−1)i)−b⌢isin(jωˆ(i−1)i)2Further(32)∑i=0ki2λk−i≈1k∑i=0ki2∑i=0kλk−i=(k+1)(2k+1)6kCλ(k)This can be recursively calculated as:(33)Hf(k)=λf⋅Hf(k−1)+Cw(k)Cλ(k)∑j=1N(aˆjcos(jωˆ(k−1)k)−bˆisin(jωˆ(k−1)k))2whereCw(k)=(k+1)(2k+1)/6kTherefore, the inverse of H(k) is obtained as:(34)Hf−1(k)=1Hf(k)Hence the update equation for the frequency is expressed as:(35)ω⌢(k+1)=ω⌢(k)+ψf(k)×e(k)Hf(k)From Eq. (33) it is clear that the speed of convergence of the proposed algorithm is dependent on the forgetting factor λf, which in turn controls the factor Cλand the Hessian matrix Hf(k). From an initial choice of Cλ=0.2, its value reaches 16.66 after a number of iterations and its equivalent value μ used in LMS type algorithm decreases from a high value of 1.3–0.06.After obtaining the various fundamental and harmonic components of the voltage and current measured at the terminals of the DGs, the various factors like the THD (total harmonic distortion), harmonic amplification factor, negative sequence components, etc. are evaluated for islanding detection [15]. These factors are defined below:Total harmonic distortion (THD) is defined as the ratio of the r.m.s of the total harmonic component to the r.m.s of the fundamental component as described under:(36)THDV=1V1∑n=2Vn2,THDI=1I1∑n=2In2where Vnand Inrepresent nth harmonic voltage and current components at the DG terminal, respectively; V1 and I1 are the corresponding fundamental components of voltage and current signals.Harmonic amplification factor, HAF, is defined as the ratio of the r.m.s of the total harmonic components with each harmonic component amplified by its order to the r.m.s of the fundamental component as described under:(37)HAFV=1V1∑n=2[nVn]2,HAFI=1I1∑n=2[nIn]2Negative sequence power is defined as follows(38)Pneg(k)=Vneg(k)∗ineg(k)∗cos(φv(k)−φi(k))where Vnegand inegare the negative sequence voltage and currents expressed as the function(39)Fneg(k)=(1/3)∗[(Fa(k)∗(cos(ϕa)+jsin(ϕa))…+(a2∗Fb(k)∗(cos(ϕb)+jsin(ϕb))+(a∗Fc(k)∗(cos(ϕc)+jsin(ϕc))]where Fnegrepresents either negative sequence voltage or current; Fa, Fb, and Fcare the a-phase, b-phase and c-phase, voltage and current components;φvand φiare the phase difference of negative sequence voltage and current and φa, φb, and φcare the phase difference of the a-phase, b-phase and c-phase voltage and current components, respectively, and a=1∠120∘.The model of the system as shown in Fig. 2 has been simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK software package.The entire model has been simulated with a system frequency of 60Hz and the sampling time (Ts) has been considered as 5×10−5s. Various types of disturbances that are created during the simulation are islanding, capacitor bank switching, switching faults (i.e. single line to ground fault, double line to ground fault and triple line to ground fault). Adding to these disturbances, we have also created some of the previously addressed cases such as distorted grid voltage, voltage swell, voltage sag and unbalanced load switching [15, 20, and 23], etc. Islanding has been simulated by opening the circuit breaker 1 (C.B.1) between bus B3 and B4. Capacitor bank switching been simulated by closing the circuit breakers (C.B.2) at bus B3 and switching faults has been simulated by closing the circuit breaker (C.B.3) at bus B3, respectively. Similarly voltage swell, voltage sag and unbalanced load switching are performed by switching (on/off) appropriate loads between bus B3 and B4 as operated by a circuit breaker (C.B.4).The factors which are considered as the basis of creating a number of cases for a particular disturbance are wind speed (in m/s) and the percentage of active power mismatch (in %). All the cases are simulated by varying the wind speed from 8m/s to 20m/s, respectively, and varying the percentage of active power mismatch from 10% to 50% respectively. The solar irradiance has been fixed at 1000W/m2 for all the cases. The output of the hybrid Gauss–Newton linear combiner (HGNLC) i.e. harmonic amplification factor and total harmonic distortion of the voltage and current signals respectively and the negative sequence power (which are denoted in this paper as HAFi, HAFv, THDi, THDvand NSP, respectively) for some of the cases of the disturbances i.e. islanding, capacitor bank switching, L-g fault, LL-g fault and LLL-g fault are shown in Figs. 3–7respectively. In a similar manner, the output for the case's, such as distorted grid voltage, voltage swell, voltage sag, unbalanced load switching is shown in Figs. 8–11, respectively. Sub figures (a) and (b), (c) and (d), (e) and (f), (g) and (h), (i) and (j) of Figs. 3–11 represent the HAFi, HAFv, THDi, THDv, and NSP, respectively. Further Table 1shows the range for maximum values of the parameters HAFv, HAFi, THDv, THDi, and NSP, respectively for minimum and maximum wind speed of 8 and 20m/s obtained from the HGNLC algorithm.As can be depicted from Figs. 3–11 and Table 1, the range of maximum values of HAFifor islanding is 6.08–19.6%, for capacitor bank switching is 5.9–9.6%, whereas for the cases like voltage swell, voltage sag and unbalanced load switching is 14.4–35.1%, which is low as compared to distorted grid voltage and switching faults, which is 25–105.5%. Similarly the range of maximum values of HAFvfor islanding is 9.6–20.6% whereas for the cases like capacitor bank switching, voltage swell, voltage sag and unbalanced load switching it is 2.4–11.1% which is again low as compared to distorted grid voltage and switching faults, which is 29.1–296%. The range of maximum values of THDifor islanding is 0.05–0.17% whereas for capacitor bank switching is (0.05–0.08), which is low as compared for cases like voltage swell, voltage sag, and unbalanced load switching, distorted grid voltage and switching faults, which is 0.08–0.9%. Similarly the range of maximum values of THDvfor islanding is 0.08–0.18% whereas for the cases like capacitor bank switching, voltage swell, voltage sag and unbalanced load switching is 0.02–0.1%, which is again low as compared to distorted grid voltage and switching faults, which is 0.26–2.68%. Finally the range of maximum values of NSP for islanding is 2×10−4 to 8×10−4%, for capacitor bank switching is 2×10−4 to 3×10−4%, for voltage swell and voltage sag is 9×10−5–6×10−4%, which is again low as compared to unbalanced load switching, distorted grid voltage and switching faults which is 0.001–0.1%.From the analysis of data, as done above, it is clear that the impact of distorted grid voltage and switching faults on the output of HGNLC is more severe as compared to other disturbances and also some of the range of maximum values for all the disturbances overlap and cannot completely distinguish the events. Thus a simple decision tree is not sufficient for accurate classification of the disturbances.In [16,17], it is demonstrated that a fuzzy expert system provides very accurate power quality disturbance classification in comparison to a host of techniques like neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, fuzzy decision trees, and support vector machines, voltage and frequency threshold systems, etc. even in the presence of substantial noise. However, most of these techniques impose computational burden in the way of designing efficient pattern recognizers. Hence, the features obtained from HGNLC can be utilized with the powerful and simple adaptive network fuzzy information system for providing accurate disturbance classification. Fig. 13 shows the flow chart of the disturbance classification technique, which is proposed in this paper. As referred to uncertainty handling capacity of the latter, in comparison to many established intelligent pattern classifiers [14,16–18], it has distinguished the islanding with other disturbances based on the values of harmonic amplification factor and total harmonic distortion. On the contrary, in this paper, the system is simulated for different islanding and non-islanding disturbances subjected to variation in wind speed (8–20m/s) and percentage of power mismatch (10–50%) respectively and the time response of the voltage and current near the DG 1 (i.e. Wind Farm) is passed through the HGNLC algorithm which calculates the parameters as described in Section 3. After the extraction of parameters for all the cases, the values are then normalized for simplification in calculation. The base value of normalization for a particular parameter is taken to be slight more than the maximum value of the parameter from the entire table.The normalized parameters which are nomenclature as x1 for HAFi, x2 for HAFv, x3 for THDi, x4 for THDvand x5 for NSP are given as inputs to the first layer of the ANFIS shown in Fig. 14. The ANFIS [16,17,20] uses a tan hyperbolic function in the consequent side of fuzzy rule base for providing more nonlinearity in the function approximation. The self-learning ability of neural network in the fuzzy information system is one of its most important features, which has made ANFIS very effective [21]. Layer 1 forms the fuzzification layer where each input is passed through a combination of triangular and a trapezoidal membership functions to give a corresponding low and high membership values shown in Fig. 15(a)–(e). The values of a, b, c, d and e for the membership function as shown in Fig. 15(f) for the input variables x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5 are given in Table 2.Based upon the equations of the triangular and trapezoidal membership functions of layer 1, the membership values ((A1, B1, C1, D1, andE1 are a set of low membership values) and (A2, B2, C2, D2, and E2 are a set of high membership values)) are calculated.A set of rules has been defined in layer 2, which is processed on the membership values as obtained in the previous layer. The rules are as follows:Rule 1: If x1 is A1∧x2 is B1∧x3 is C1∧x4 is D1∧x5 is E1. Then the output isO=tanh(a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x4+a5x5)Rule 2: If x1 is A2∧x2 is B2∧x3 is C2∧x4 is D2∧x5 is E2. Then the output isO=tanh(b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4+b5x5)The outputs W1 and W2 from the rules at layer 2 are obtained as(40)W1=μA1(x1)×μB1(x2)×μC1(x3)×μD1(x4)×μE1(x5)(41)W2=μA2(x1)×μB2(x2)×μC2(x3)×μD2(x4)×μE2(x5)where μA1(x1), μA2(x1), μB1(x2), μB2(x2), μC1(x3), μC2(x3), μD1(x4), μD2(x4), μE1(x5), μE2(x5) are the fuzzy membership values for the input features x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.The firing strength of each rule is being normalized in the next layer 3 as follows:(42)N1=W1W1+W2andN2=W2W1+W2In layer 4, the tan hyperbolic function of input parameter set and certain weight parameter set (Eq. (43)) are associated along with the normalized functions as obtained in the previous layer to validate the ANFIS structure as follows:(43)O1=N1×tanh(a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x4+a5x5)O2=N2×tanh(b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4+b5x5)where (a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5) is the weight parameter set of the ANFIS. The initial values of the parameters are taken as a0=0.001, a1=0.01, a2=1, a3=1, a4=1, a5=1, b0=0.001, b1=0.01, b2=1, b3=1, b4=1 and b5=1.The final layer 5 computes the summation of the results obtained in the previous layer to give the final output O.(44)O=O1+O2The next objective is to optimize the parameter set (a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5) which is done by gradient descent method as shown in Fig. 16.(45)a0(t)=a0(t−1)+η∗∈∗N1∗sec2h(a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x4+a5x5)(46)an(t)=an(t−1)+η∗∈∗N1∗xn∗sec2h(a0+a1x1+a2x2+a3x3+a4x4+a5x5)(47)b0(t)=b0(t−1)+η∗∈∗N2∗sec2h(b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4+b5x5)(48)bn(t)=bn(t−1)+η∗∈∗N2∗xn∗sec2h(b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4+b5x5)where n=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], є=(d–O), є is the error function, d=desired output, and O is the output of the ANFIS at each step of the optimization technique. η is defined as a learning parameter whose value is set to 0.01. The desired value ‘d’ for islanding is taken as 0 and for non-islanding is taken as −1 during the training session. After extensive training of the ANFIS structure for the datasets of both the islanding and non-islanding events, the final values of the ANFIS parameter set are found out as a0=2.7102, a1=0.1588, a2=1.3366, a3=1.1375, a4=1.3569, a5=1.1918, b0=1.4338, b1=0.1014, b2=1.2360, b3=1.0845, b4=1.2502 and b5=1.5431. The fuzzy membership values for different islanding and non-islanding events are shown in Table 3. In the non-islanding category three cases such as case 1: distorted grid voltage; case 2: triple line to ground fault; case 3: single line to ground fault; exhibit fuzzy membership values which are used to categorize them accurately.After the weights and parameters of the ANFIS are frozen, 100 normalized data sets were selected for testing validation. Table 4shows the classification accuracy for most of the data sets regarding islanding, capacitor switching, balanced and unbalanced faults, distorted grid voltage, unbalanced load switching, voltage swell and voltage sag, respectively. From these results the efficacy of the proposed HGNLC algorithm and ANFIS in detecting power islands and other disturbances are vindicated.Generally non-detection zone for islanding is being defined as the zone under which the perfect islanding is not detected. This is also one of the disadvantages of the proposed method. Our net power production from the distributed generations is 11MW (i.e. 9MW from DG 1 and 2MW from the DG 2). Hence 11MW is considered as the base value for calculating the percentage of active power mismatch. The deviation of active power of the total load (across the network under consideration) from this value decides the percentage of active power mismatch generally expressed in %. For our paper we have found out the non-detection zone only for two wind speeds i.e. 8m/s and 20m/s. We have done an extensive simulation of islanding by varying the percentage of active power mismatch over a wide range keeping the wind speed constant. Fig. 12shows the outputs of the HGNLC for non- detection zone of islanding. Fig. 17(a) and (b) shows the representation of the non-detection zone in terms of percentage of power mismatch for wind speed of 8m/s and 20m/s respectively. As can be clearly seen the non-detection zone of islanding for a wind speed of 8m/s is found out between the zone of active power mismatch of 0.09–13.66% and the non-detection zone of islanding for a wind speed of 20m/s is found out between the zone of active power mismatch of −34.30% to −20.63%. For any other percentage of active power mismatches out of these zones, there is a perfect detection of islanding.In this section, the performance of the proposed passive disturbance technique is compared with some of the commonly used techniques. All the cases as described in Section 4 are simulated for the network shown in Fig. 2. Common methods such as rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) in Hz/s, rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) in V/s and change in frequency in Hz are implemented and compared with the proposed disturbance detection technique as shown in Table 5. The type of technique used is shown in column 2 of the table. All the cases of disturbance are broadly categorized as islanding and non-islanding events as shown in column 3. All the methods are compared on the basis of the classification accuracy (CA) of the techniques as shown in column 6, which is based on the correct detection of islanding and correct non-detection of islanding. It is observed that the ROCOF based technique almost distinguishes islanding with a CA of 100% but lacks for distinguishing non-islanding with CA of 88.18%. Thus the overall CA for this technique was found out to be 94.09%. The proposed disturbance detection and classification technique has the highest overall CA of 98.76%. On the contrary, for ROCOV and change in frequency techniques, there exists a high risk of wrong detection and misclassification as the overall CA lies below 90%.In all the techniques compared above, they are able to classify islanding and non-islanding disturbances, but fail to classify the exact nature of different non-islanding disturbances such as capacitor bank switching and switching faults (i.e. L-g, LL-g and LLL-g faults), distorted grid voltage, voltage swell, voltage sag or unbalanced load switching, which is considered as a problem for future work.
