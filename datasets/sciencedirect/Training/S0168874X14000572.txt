@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Flat shell elements are widely used to analyze the behavior of thin structures. These flat shell elements can be easily formulated, and they provide convenience in managing complex loading and boundary conditions [1]. Generally, a flat shell element is obtained through combining a plane membrane element and a plate bending element. Triangular shell elements have the advantage of automatic mesh generation in an arbitrary geometry and they are not influenced by element warping. A conventional triangular membrane element such as a constant strain triangle (CST [2]) can be used to produce a triangular shell element with 15 degrees of freedom (15DOF) when combined with various 9DOF plate elements. However, the 15DOF triangular flat shell elements do not behave well due to their poor membrane behavior and the absence of coupling between the membrane and bending actions [3]. Furthermore, their lack of drilling rotation causes singularity when all elements are coplanar. For the latter issue, one solution is to restrain the drilling DOFs through eliminating the null terms of the stiffness matrix during the finite element assembly process. Other solutions include using membrane elements with drilling DOFs or imposing an artificially small stiffness to be associated with the drilling rotations [3–6].Several approaches have been investigated in order to enhance the membrane behavior [7]. Among the numerous methods, one possible approach for the triangular element is to add higher order displacement modes that are linked with corner rotations that are normal to the element plane, i.e. the drilling DOFs. Allman [8] successfully attached drilling DOFs to membrane elements; in Allman׳s element, the displacement fields are deduced from the six-node LST element. The first element proposed by Allman is known to have a spurious zero-energy mode, and the rotational connectors at the vertices are not true rotations in the context of plane elasticity. Bergan and Felippa [7] proposed a 9DOF triangular element with rotational DOFs using the free formulation [9]. In their following studies [10–13], Felippa et al. introduced the assumed natural deviatoric strain (ANDES) formulation, which combines the free formulation and a variant of the assumed natural strain method. In the ANDES formulation, a higher order torsional mode is also considered in order to attain rank sufficiency. Furthermore, unlike Allman׳s element, the ANDES formulation utilizes true rotations as the drilling DOFs. The ANDES formulation has also been extended to develop a plate bending element [14,15].Adding the drilling rotations to the membrane element can avoid the singularity problem that occurs in normal 15DOF shell elements. However, the presence of the drilling DOFs may cause undesirable locking phenomena in the shell analysis; that is, the model can become excessively stiff because the rotational DOFs associated with the bending activate membrane strains as well as bending strains [3]. This locking phenomenon, which was originally classified as ‘membrane locking’ [3,4,16–18], remains a difficulty in the development of defect-free flat shell elements. Because only the presence of drilling stiffness causes this problem, this type of locking is also termed separately as ‘drill rotation locking’ [19]. The drill rotation locking tendency becomes more obvious as elements become thinner, and it vanishes as elements become coplanar. Cook made closer observations [3]; in his work, a factor that is related to the ‘amount of non-coplaneness’ was multiplied in the stabilization matrix in order to alleviate the drill rotation locking. Reduced integration methods [3,16,17], non-conforming modes [18], and scaling the shear modulus using an arbitrary parameter depending on the importance of the drill rotations [19] have also been investigated for the alleviation of drill rotation locking; however, a solution for the complete removal of the source of drill rotation locking has not yet been found.Much research has been undertaken that focuses on the development of a flat shell element with rotational DOFs. Providas et al. [5] proposed an 18DOF flat shell element with the addition of true drilling rotations that contribute minimally to the strain energy. Wang et al. [20] proposed two quasi-conforming triangular flat shell elements (QCS31 and QCS32) using Timoshenko׳s beam function. A constrained true drilling rotation was attached to the QCS31 element, while an Allman-type drilling rotation was attached to the QCS32 element. In their results, the drill rotation locking phenomenon occurred on the QCS32 element, but not on the QCS31 element. Zengjie et al. [22] proposed flat shell elements that were formed through assembling refined triangular discrete Mindlin plate elements (RDKTM [21]) and either the CST with a small stiffness associated with the true drilling DOFs (RDKTM18(T)) or the Allman׳s triangle (RDKTM18(P)). Due to the drill rotation locking, RDKTM18(P) exhibited very poor results compared with the RDKTM18(T) on the thin shell problems. Zhang et al. [23] developed a flat shell element through combining the ANDES element with optimal parameters [13] and the RDKTM plate element. However, while treatment for the drill rotation locking phenomenon was not introduced, they demonstrated that the element worked well both in thin and thick shell problems.Recently, different approaches to enhancing the membrane response without adding drilling DOFs have been proposed; Liu et al. proposed a smoothed finite element method (SFEM) through the application of a generalized gradient smoothing technique to the standard finite element method (FEM) [24–26]. The concept of a smoothed FEM has been extended to a node-based strain smoothed FEM (NS-FEM) [27,28] and an edge-based strain smoothed FEM (ES-FEM) for triangular meshes [29,30]. In the ES-FEM, the system stiffness is computed over the smoothing domains that are associated with the edges of the triangular elements. It was found that the edge-based strain smoothing causes the behavior of the CST elements to become much softer. The ES-FEM has also been extended to plate and shell elements [31,32].Other interesting research has also been undertaken. Lee and Bathe [33] developed a three-node triangular element based on a mixed interpolation of tensorial components (MITC3). MITC3 has a simple formulation and is known to be free from membrane locking, but some transverse shear locking remains in the solution of clamped plate problems and the hyperboloid shell problems [34]. Recently, the improved version of the MITC3 shell element using the Hellinger–Reissner principle was provided in order to correct the transverse shear locking behavior [35]. Kim et al. proposed a three-node macro triangular element for the analysis of plates and shells based on the assumed natural strains [36,37].In this paper, an ANDES formulation is used to construct the membrane stiffness of the proposed shell element with drilling DOFs. For further enhancement of the membrane response, an edge-based strain smoothing technique was applied to the basic stiffness component of the ANDES element. Furthermore, appropriate values for the free parameters in the ANDES element are proposed for thin shell analyses. The discrete Kirchhoff–Mindlin triangle (DKMT [38]) plate element, which has a proper rank and is free of transverse shear locking, is combined to formulate an 18DOF shell element. In order to alleviate the drill rotation locking, a scale factor is multiplied by the source terms of the drill rotation-bending coupling. This method is very similar to that proposed by Cook [3], but it is modified in order to correspond to flat shell elements. The singularity problem is naturally suppressed by the presence of the drilling DOFs, and a stabilization matrix is not required in the proposed element. Various numerical benchmark problems are presented in the last section in order to verify the performance of the proposed element.The triangular flat shell element with corner drilling DOFs presented inFig. 1 is obtained by combining a 9DOF membrane element and a 9DOF plate bending element. The finite element equation of the shell is expressed in the standard discretized algebraic form, as follows:(2.1)Kshelld=(Kmemb+Kplate)d=fwhere Kshell, d=[d1d2d3]T, and f are the stiffness matrix of the shell element, nodal displacement, and element load vector in the local coordinates, respectively, and Kmemb and Kplate are the stiffness matrices of the membrane and plate components, respectively.The nodal displacements diis(2.2)di=[uiviwiθxiθyiθzi]Twhere ui, vi, and wiare the nodal translations, θxiand θyiare bending rotations along thex^andy^axes, and θziis the drilling rotation along thez^axis. In Eq. (2.1), the membrane stiffness Kmemb has the nodal DOFs of dmi=[uiviθzi]T (i=1,2,3), and the plate stiffness Kplate has the nodal DOFs of dpi=[wiθxiθyi]T (i=1,2,3).The system stiffness, which is formed by the flat shell elements, is obtained through assembling the element stiffness matrices in Eq. (2.1):(2.3)Ks=∑i=1NelT(i)TKshell(i)T(i)whereKshell(i)and T(i) are the stiffness matrix and transformation matrix from the local to the global coordinates of the ith shell element, and Nel is the total number of elements. The finite element solution can be obtained by solving the following equation:(2.4)KsD=Fwhere D is the global nodal displacement vector and F is the global force vector.The ANDES formulation proposed by Felippa et al. [11] is based on the free formulation (FF) and a variant of the assumed natural strain (ANS) method [39,40].In the free formulation, the membrane element stiffness is expressed in the fundamental decomposed form of K=Kb+Kh, where Kb is the basic stiffness that contains rigid body modes and constant strain modes and is essential for convergence. Kh is the higher order stiffness that relates to the bending and torsion modes and is constructed for stability and accuracy. This decomposition can be performed if an element satisfies the individual element test (IET).The explicit form of the basic stiffness Kb of a triangular element is derived from the constitutive matrix and force lumping matrix. The force lumping matrix L is related to the mean strain–displacement matrix Bb in a one-point reduced integration scheme in the form of Bb=LT/V:(2.5)Kb=VBbTEBb=1VLELTwhere(2.6)L=12t[y230x320x32y2316aby23(y13−y21)16abx32(x31−x12)13ab(x31y13−x12y21)y310x130x13y3116aby31(y21−y32)16abx13(x12−x23)13ab(x12y21−x23y32)y120x210x21y1216aby12(y32−y13)16abx21(x23−x31)13ab(x23y32−x31y13)],E=Et1−ν2[1ν0ν10001−ν2]in which xijand yijdenote the coordinate differences between i and j nodes of a triangular element, V and t are element volume and thickness, respectively, and E is the elastic modulus matrix.In the above equations, the parameter αb is a freely selectable scale factor related to the corner rotation. If factor αb is chosen as a value greater than unity, the element performance is improved significantly [7]. This factor should be used identically for all elements in an assembly in order to pass the individual element test. If αb=0, the basic stiffness becomes a CST stiffness and is associated with translations only.For the derivation of the higher order stiffness Kh, the assumed natural strain method is adopted. Here, the hierarchical drilling freedoms are defined to express the higher order modes compactly. The hierarchical corner rotationsθ˜can be extracted by subtracting the mean rotation θ0 from the total corner rotations θzi[11]:(2.7)θ˜i=θzi−θ0where(2.8)θ0=14A(x23u1+x31u2+x12u3+y23v1+y31v2+y12v3)in which uiand videnote the displacement components along x and y directions, and A is the element area.From the above equations, the hierarchical corner rotation can be defined as follows:(2.9)θ˜=[θ˜1θ˜2θ˜3]=14A[x32y324Ax13y130x21y210x32y320x13y134Ax21y210x32y320x13y130x21y214A][u1v1θz1u2v2θz2u3v3θz3]=T˜θuuR.The higher order stiffness matrix is(2.10)Kh=cfT˜θuTKθT˜θuwhere cf denotes the scale parameter, and Kθis the 3×3 higher order stiffness in terms of the hierarchical rotationsθ˜.In order to express Kθ, a matrix Qithat defines the relationships between the natural strain εiand corner rotationθ˜is introduced. The natural strains depicted inFig. 2 are expressed as follows:(2.11)ε=[ε21ε32ε13]T=Bdθ˜=(Q1ζ1+Q2ζ2+Q3ζ3)θ˜where(2.12)Q1=2A3[β1l212β2l212β3l212β4l322β5l322β6l322β7l132β8l132β9l132],Q2=2A3[β9l212β7l212β8l212β3l322β1l322β2l322β6l132β4l132β5l132],Q3=2A3[β5l212β6l212β4l212β8l322β9l322β7l322β2l132β3l132β1l132]in which ς1, ς2, and ς3 are the area coordinates, β1,…,β9 are the non-dimensional scale parameters that are used to balance the energy of the higher order modes, and lij2=xij2+yij2.From the natural strain matrix, Kθis defined as follows:(2.13)Kθ=∫ABdT(tEnat)BddA.In Eq. (2.13), Enat is the natural stress–strain matrix that is constant over the triangle, and it is defined using the transformation matrix Te between the natural strains and Cartesian strains(2.14)Enat=TeTETe,(2.15){exxeyy2exy}=Te{ε12ε23ε31}=14A2[y23y13l212y31y21l322y12y32l132x23x13l212x31x21l322x12x32l132(y23x31+x32y13)l212(y31x12+x13y21)l322(y12x23+x21y32)l132]{ε12ε23ε31}.From the above equations, the final form of the membrane stiffness matrix of the ANDES element is as follows:(2.16)Kmemb_ANDES(αb,β0,β1,…,β9)=Kb(αb)+Kh(β0,β1,…,β9)=1VLTEL+34β0T˜θuTKθT˜θuwhere αb, β0, β1,…, β9 are the free parameters to be defined. These are discussed in Section 3.For use as a shell element, the membrane element in Eq. (2.16) can be combined with various plate elements, e.g. discrete Kirchhoff triangle (DKT) [41,42], discrete Kirchhoff–Mindlin triangle (DKMT) [38], Mindlin–Reissner plate based on the mixed shear projected approach (MiSP3) [43], refined triangular Kirchhoff/Mindlin plate (RDKT/RDKTM) [21,44,45], discrete shear gap (DSG) [46], and many others. In this paper, the ANDES membrane element is combined with the DKMT plate element in order to analyze both thin and thick shells. The element stiffness of the proposed flat shell element is(2.17)Kshell=Kmemb_ANDES+Kplate_DKMTwhere Kplate_DKMT is the plate stiffness of the DKMT element [38] in the local coordinates.Liu et al. proposed an edge-based strain smoothed FEM (ES-FEM) to alleviate the stiff behavior of the triangular element. In the ES-FEM, the smoothed strain is calculated in the domain that is constructed by two elements sharing an edge. As shown inFig. 3, a smoothing domain is defined by connecting the centroid of each triangular element with two nodes from the shared edge. The whole problem domain is divided by these non-overlapped stationary smoothing domains. The ES-FEM model is often found to be super-convergent and more accurate than a conventional FEM model with the same sets of nodes [31]. In this paper, the edge-based strain smoothing technique is applied to the basic stiffness of the ANDES element in order to enhance the membrane behavior.In Eq. (2.5), the constant strain that forms the basic stiffness of the ANDES element can be represented as(2.18)εb=Bbd=[Bb1Bb2Bb3]{d1d2d3}where(2.19)Bb1=1AtL1T=12A[y23016aby23(y13−y21)0x3216abx32(x31−x12)x32y2313ab(x31y13−x12y21)]in which di={uiviθzi}T, and Bb2 and Bb3 can be obtained using a cyclic expression.The strain matrix Bb only relates with constant strain and rigid body mode; hence, it has a constant value over the element. This property enables the application of the strain smoothing technique. The smoothed basic strain matrix calculated on the smoothing domain is(2.20)B¯b(k)=∑i=1NkA(ki)A(k)Bb(ki)where A(k) is the total area of the kth smoothing domain,Bb(ki)is the basic strain matrix, A(ki) is the area of the smoothing sub-domain which belongs to the ith triangular element around edge k, and Nkdenotes the total number of triangular elements around edge k (Nk=2 for an interior edge, and Nk=1 for an exterior boundary edge). If the smoothing domain is placed along the exterior boundary edge, the smoothed strain is equal to that of the element to which the smoothing domain belongs.In order to apply the strain smoothing technique to the membrane component of the shell element, the detailed procedure introduced in Ref. [32] was adopted in this paper. On a curved geometry, two adjacent triangular elements may not be placed on the same plane. In this case, the smoothed strain should be calculated on the neutral plane that is defined from the areas and normal vectors of the elements. The coordinates of the neutral plane around edge k shown inFig. 4 is calculated as follows:(2.21)x˜(k)=xq−xp|xq−xp|,z˜(k)=A(k1)A(k)z^(k1)+A(k2)A(k)z^(k2),y˜(k)=z˜(k)⊗x˜(k).The strain matrix in the neutral plane is transformed simply from the element local strain matrix(2.22)B˜b=Rm1Rm2B^bTwhere(2.23)Rm1=[cx˜x2cx˜y2cx˜z2cx˜xcy˜xcx˜ycx˜zcx˜xcx˜zcy˜x2cy˜y2cy˜z2cy˜xcy˜ycy˜ycy˜zcy˜xcy˜z2cx˜xcy˜x2cx˜ycy˜y2cx˜zcy˜zcx˜xcy˜y+cy˜xcx˜ycx˜zcy˜y+cy˜zcx˜ycx˜xcy˜z+cy˜xcx˜z](2.24)Rm2=[cx^x2cy^x2cx^xcy^xcx^y2cy^y2cx^ycy^ycx^z2cy^z2cx^zcy^z2cx^xcx^y2cy^xcy^ycx^xcy^y+cx^ycy^x2cx^ycx^z2cy^ycy^zcx^ycy^z+cx^zcy^y2cx^xcx^z2cy^xcy^zcx^xcy^z+cx^zcy^x]in whichB^bis the strain matrix in the element local coordinates, T is the transformation matrix from the local to the global coordinates, andcx˜ydenotes the direction cosine betweenx^and y axes as usual.Replacing Bb in Eq. (2.20) with Eq. (2.22), the smoothed strain matrix in the global coordinates is written as follows:(2.25)B¯b(k)=1A(k)∑I=1NkA(kI)B˜b(kI)=1A(k)∑I=1NkA(kI)Rm1(kI)Rm2(kI)B^b(kI)T(I)The smoothed basic stiffness of the ANDES element on the kth smoothing domain is obtained from the above equation, as follows:(2.26)K¯b(k)=∫Ωk(B¯b(k))TE(B¯b(k))dΩ.Finally, the membrane component of the system stiffness is obtained through assembling the smoothed basic stiffness and the non-smoothed higher order stiffness matrices, as follows:(2.27)K¯membs=∑k=1NedgeK¯b(k)+∑i=1NelT(i)TKh(i)T(i)where Nedge is the total number of edges (equal to the total number of smoothing domains) of all triangular elements, Nel is the total number of elements,K¯b(k)is the smoothed basic stiffness calculated in the kth smoothing domain,Kh(i)is the higher order stiffness of the ith element in Eq. (2.16), and T(i) is the transformation matrix from the local coordinates of the ith element to the global coordinates.In this paper, the system stiffness Ks in Eq. (2.3) is obtained using Eqs. (2.17) and (2.27), as follows:(2.28)Ks=K¯membs+∑i=1NelT(i)TKplate_DKMT(i)T(i).whereKplateDKMT(i)is the DKMT plate stiffness of the ith element in the local coordinates.The original basic stiffness of the ANDES element is formulated based on the individual element test. Therefore, it satisfies the requirements to pass the patch test. This property remains after adjusting the strain smoothing technique into the basic stiffness of the ANDES element. This indicates that the proposed element can pass the patch tests and that it converges.The performance of the ANDES element is influenced greatly through the choice of the free parameters. The optimal parameters that were proposed by Felippa [13] were selected in order to provide a ratio of bending strain energy for the ANDES element to the analytical solution of the rectangular mesh under pure bending loads as a unity. The optimal parameter values given by Felippa are as follows:(3.1)αb=1.5,β0=0.5,β1=β3=β5=1,β2=2,β4=0,β6=β7=β8=−1,β9=−2The parameter values in Eq. (3.1) were obtained by assuming Poisson׳s ratio to be 0 and, for the arbitrary Poisson׳s ratio, β0=0.5(1−4ν2) was suggested. These values were derived using the process of symbolic analysis and were optimized for the plane membrane bending problem. In Ref. [13], in order to determine the optimal values, a beam model with one layer of identical rectangular mesh was used to evaluate the bending strain energy. This procedure requires the strain energy of the individual triangular element to be in algebraic form. However, the same procedure may not be used for the present element because the element stiffness cannot be obtained as a closed form on the individual element when using the edge-based strain smoothed FEM. This leads that the parameter values in Eq. (3.1) cannot be optimal for the proposed element.Meanwhile, a problem of drill rotation locking is induced when an element with the drilling DOFs is used for the membrane part of a shell element. This locking phenomenon occurs due to the interelement membrane-bending coupling as shown inFig. 5. When a curved geometry is modeled using flat shell elements, the membrane and the bending stiffness are coupled at the interelement boundaries. A nodal rotation θb2, which is associated with the bending deformation, is partly resisted by drilling component θm1. Because the membrane stiffness varies proportional to the element thickness t while the bending stiffness is proportional to t3, the large membrane stiffness tends to lock the bending rotations of the adjacent elements as the shell thins. This locking phenomenon vanishes as the elements become coplanar.The ANDES element has the higher order stiffness Kh that induces this drill rotation locking. If the contribution of Kh in the entire element stiffness is decreased, the drill rotation locking can be reduced significantly. However, when the ratio of the higher order stiffness to the entire element stiffness is decreased, another undesirable phenomenon will occur. This phenomenon, referred to as the ‘free-corner’ problem by Cook [3], appears as very large but fictitious displacements on the nodes that are not shared by any other elements. This phenomenon is simply interpreted as a state where the stabilization matrix (i.e. the higher order stiffness) is not sufficiently added to the rank deficient stiffness (i.e. the basic stiffness). That is, the proportion of the higher-order stiffness creates an important function to alleviate both the drill rotation locking and the free-corner problem.Among the parameters in Eq. (3.1), the values of the parameters αb and β0 are mostly related to the membrane locking and the free-corner problems, whereas the other parameters have a smaller effect. This paper focuses on the appropriate choice for parameters αb and β0 in order to obtain a better result on the curved geometry that is modeled using the flat shell element with the drilling DOFs. An optimal set of β1,…, β9 may exist for the proposed element, but it is not considered in this paper. While many possible choices for β1,…, β9 are available, the same parameters shown in Eq. (3.1) are used in this paper, except αb and β0.One remedy to alleviate both membrane locking and free-corner problems is to set parameter αb to a sufficiently low value. For an arbitrary value of parameter αb, the free-corner problem does not occur when the value of parameter β0 is chosen as β0≈αb2. This will maintain the balance of the strain energy associated with the drill rotation between the basic stiffness and higher order stiffness. By choosing a value of αb lower than unity, the value for β0 can be selected to be much lower, which is beneficial in alleviating the membrane locking phenomenon. However, such an effect will be diminished for very thin shell elements. Moreover, if the value of αb is too small, the stiffness matrix becomes ill-conditioned or unable to guarantee the convergence in a specific problem such as Raasch׳s hook [47]. From various numerical tests, αb=1/10–1/6 and β0=αb2/4 provides reasonable results.Another remedy is to reduce parameter β0 by an amount of non-coplaneness: Cook has already investigated this method [3]. If the elements become thinner and non-coplanar, the bending behavior becomes more important. When a problem is bending-dominant, the higher order stiffness becomes less important and the opportunity to induce the free-corner problem is also reduced. This tendency allows the reduction of β0 by a factor of non-coplaneness. In Ref. [3], the reduction factor is expressed in terms of midside height hmax, which is shown in Fig. 5 as an amount of non-coplaneness. However, this midside height hmax results from the curved shell geometry that cannot be easily obtained for an arbitrary geometry. Hence, in this paper, a maximum inter-planar angle was used instead of the midside heights hmax. The maximum inter-planar angle γmax is an angle that is a maximum between the normal vectors of the current element and adjacent elements, as follows:(3.2)γmax=max(γi)where γiis the angle between the normal vectors of the current element and the ith adjacent element.The proposed set of parameter αb and β0 is given by(3.3)αb=18β0=αb24{1+(Lmaxsin(0.5γmax)/2t)2}where γmax denotes the maximum inter-planar angle and Lmax is the greatest length of the three edges of the element. The value of β0 converges toαb2/4 as the mesh is refined or the non-coplaneness decreases.The proposed element was compared with the following elements.•Allman: a triangular membrane element with Allman׳s rotational DOFs [8] combined with a DKMT plate bending element.Cook, flat-stiffened: a stabilized 18DOF triangular flat shell element proposed by Cook [3]. The non-coplaneness between the adjacent elements was not considered. In this paper, the plate bending element was replaced with the DKMT element (instead of the DKT element in the original paper).Cook, curved-softened: a stabilized 18DOF triangular curved shell element proposed by Cook [3]. The DKT element was used and the amount of non-coplaneness was considered.Providas and Kattis: a triangular shell element with an arbitrary small true drilling stiffness proposed by Providas and Kattis [5]. The overall performance was nearly identical to the result of the 15DOF shell element, but the singularity problem that occurs when all elements are coplanar was suppressed. In this paper, the plate bending element was replaced by the DKMT element (instead of the DKT element in the original paper).ANDES (OPT): the ANDES triangular element with optimal parameters proposed by Felippa [13] combined with the DKMT plate bending element.Present: the proposed strain smoothed membrane triangular element combined with the DKMT plate bending element. The parameter β0 was modified by a factor of non-coplaneness.Present (†non-smoothed): the proposed element as stated above without the edge-based strain smoothing process described in Section 2.3.Present (†fixed β0): the proposed strain smoothed membrane triangular element combined with the DKMT plate bending element. The parameter β0 was fixed to 1/256.Note that the numerical results of each element compared in this paper may differ from the original papers due to the plate bending stiffness and mesh shapes. The proposed element was tested for two different β0 scenarios in order to investigate the effect of alleviating the drill rotation locking. The first scenario fixed the β0 to αb2/4 (=1/256); the second scenario reduced the β0 by a factor of non-coplaneness as given in Eq. (3.3).A clamped trapezoidal beam subjected to a uniformly distributed in-plane load is investigated in order to test the membrane behavior. This popular problem has no known analytical solution; thus, the reference solution of the vertical displacement at the free-end mid-point shown in Ref. [12] is used for comparison. The geometry of the problem and the typical shape of the mesh are illustrated inFig. 6.Table 1 presents the normalized vertical displacement at point C according to the reference solution of 23.95. The performance of the proposed element without strain smoothing was significantly lower than the ANDES (OPT) element, because the role of the drilling rotation is weakened by the proposed set of parameters αb and β0. However, the results demonstrate that the edge-based strain smoothing improves the membrane behavior of the ANDES element with the proposed set of parameters αb and β0. The convergence rate of the proposed element was the fastest as the mesh was refined.The shear-loaded cantilever beam defined inFig. 7 was investigated. At the fixed end, the drilling rotation must not be constrained because the term ∂uy/∂r in continuum-mechanics definition is nonzero [7]. The finest grid result from Ref. [7] was used in this experiment as the reference solution (i.e. δc=0.35587).Table 2 presents the vertical deflection at point C that was scaled by the reference solution. The optimal ANDES element proposed by Felippa [13] exhibited very good results even in the coarse meshes. As stated in Section 2.2, if the parameter αb has a value larger than unity, ANDES-type elements provide excellent results in pure bending problems. For the proposed element, αb=1/8 causes the result to have less accuracy compared with the ANDES (OPT) element.Fig. 8 illustrates a cylinder bounded by rigid diaphragms at each end and subjected to a pair of concentrated forces. One-eighth of the structure is considered here. The analytical solution for the deflection at the loaded point given by Flügge [48] is w=−1.8248×10−5, but it is obtained by neglecting the shear deformation. Therefore, another reference solution w=−1.8541×10−5 that was reported by Cho and Roh [49] is used here for comparison.Table 3 presents the numerical results for the given problem. The curved shell proposed by Cook exhibited the best results in this problem. The performances of the other flat shells with drilling DOFs, including the proposed elements, did not differ significantly.Fig. 9 illustrates a hemispherical shell with an 18° hole at its top that is subjected to point loads. This problem is useful in testing the ability to represent inextensional modes while exhibiting almost zero membrane strain. The reference value for the radial deflection at point A is ux=0.094 [50].Table 4 presents the radial deflection at point A that was scaled by the reference solution. Some 18DOF shell element exhibited very poor results in coarse meshes due to the drill rotation locking phenomenon. Only the element proposed by Providas and Kattis was free from drill rotation locking. However, the proposed element with non-fixed β0 also provided a good result even in the coarse meshes.The benchmark problem proposed by Scordelis and Lo is presented inFig. 10. A roof structure is subjected to its self-weight and is supported by rigid diaphragms. In the analysis, one quarter of the whole structure is considered. The reference solution for the vertical deflection at the midpoint of the free edge is 0.3024 [50].Table 5 presents the numerical results. For all element types, the results were too flexible in the coarse meshes. However, among these results, the proposed elements exhibited good convergence.This problem was suggested as a suitable test for locking behavior [51]. As a result of symmetry, one half of the structure is considered. The structure is clamped at one end and subjected to self-weight. Currently, an analytical solution is not available for this problem; instead, a reference solution is obtained using a very fine mesh of quadrilateral shell elements. The reference solution of the deflection at point P inFig. 11 is obtained with meshes of 294,912 elements (δz=0.005958).Table 6 presents the numerical results. In Table 6, most of elements with drilling DOFs exhibited very poor results due to the drill rotation locking phenomenon. Both the proposed element with a non-fixed β0 and the element proposed by Providas and Kattis did not suffer from drill rotation locking and exhibited good results for the coarse meshes.A 90° pre-twisted beam under unit shear loading is illustrated inFig. 12. Two loading conditions were considered: a unit shear load along the in-plane direction (direction A) and a unit shear load along the out-of-plane direction (direction B). Reference solutions for the deflection along the loaded direction at the midpoint of the free edge have been provided in Ref. [3].As shown inTable 7, severe drill rotation locking appeared in most shell elements with drilling DOFs. The proposed element with a fixed β0 also exhibited poor behavior in the coarse meshes due to the membrane locking phenomenon, but it converged rapidly to the precise solution as the mesh was refined. The proposed element with a non-fixed β0 exhibited a good result and converged quickly to the precise solution. This benchmark problem normally exhibits better results with 15DOF elements or 18DOF elements with an arbitrary small true drilling rotation.This problem is useful for testing the stability of an element under mixed deformation patterns of bending, extension and twisting. According to Ref. [52], if an increasingly smooth description of the shell geometry across the element boundaries is provided, this will result in rank deficiency of the stiffness matrix due to its inability to transfer the twisting moments correctly. If appropriate drilling stiffness is not provided, the result will not be converged.The geometry of Raasch׳s hook is illustrated inFig. 13. A curved strip is clamped rigidly at one end and subjected to a unit load on the opposite side. Currently, an analytical solution is not available for this problem; thus, the reference solution of 5.027 for the displacement in the load direction of the free edge is used [53].Table 8 presents the tip deflection at free end that was scaled by the reference solution. The results show that the proposed elements are able to converge to the reference solution. The first three elements in Table 8 show the result being diverged, and this phenomenon can also be observed from other 15DOF shell elements.
