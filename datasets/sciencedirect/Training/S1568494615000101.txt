@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Dynamic lubrication analysis of connecting rod is a very complex problem. Some factors have great effect on lubrication, such as clearance, oil viscosity, oil supplying hole, bearing elastic modulus, surface roughness, oil supplying pressure and engine speed and bearing width. In this paper, ten indexes are used as the input parameters to evaluate the bearing performances: minimum oil film thickness (MOFT), friction loss, the maximum oil film pressure (MOFP) and average of the oil leakages (OLK). Two orthogonal experiments are combined to identify the factors dominating the bearing behavior. The stepwise regression is used to establish the regression model without insignificant variables, and two most important variables are used as the input to carry out the surface response analysis for each model. At last, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to identify the asperity contact. Compared with SVM model, the particle swarm optimization-support vector machines (PSO–SVM) can predict the asperity contact more precise, especially to the samples near dividing line.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is estimated that mechanical friction loss accounts for around 10% of the total energy in the fuel for a diesel engine, and about 40–55% of the friction losses are due to the power cylinder system, made up of the piston (25–47%), ring-pack (28–45%) and connecting-rod bearings (18–33%) [1], so connecting rod also contributes main friction loss to the engine. A connecting rod assembly in an engine, which consists of rod, cap, bolts, big-end bearing and small-end bushing, the connecting rod serves as an important joint between the connecting rod big-end and crank pin. The connecting rod bearing is one of the most highly stresses tribological component in an engine because of the complicated dynamic loading and surface rubbing motion it encounters. The knowledge required for this particular task implies a good understanding of the connecting rod lubrication performances.Bearings are the most important but also the most difficult elements to design, it is the most difficult to design due to the changeable bearing loads from the cylinder pressure and dynamic balance. From the literature reviewed, during the past two decades, many research articles had been written about the connecting rod bearing. Due to the important of flexible deformation and too many parameters which affect the lubrication, classic hydrodynamic lubrication model was development to elasto-hydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication or thermal elasto-hydrodynamic (TEHD) lubrication, nearly all the parameters that affect the performances were researcher. Fantino et al. [2,3] studied the effect of the deformation of an elastic automotive connecting rod on the oil film characteristics in the big-end bearing. Fantino and Frêne [4] studied the influence of the engine type petrol and diesel on the same result, but no conclusion could be made about the impact of other parameters load and speed, he also focused on the effect of the viscosity on the minimum film thickness for a connecting rod big-end bearing. However, as concerns the speed influence. Aitken [5,6] found an EHD parametric result, which shows a decrease of the minimum film thickness in the range 100–700rpm. A more complete parametric study which involves the load, engine speed, and bearing stiffness on the lubrication is also reported. Okamoto et al. [7] reported the effects of bearing length and housing stiffness on the connecting rod big-end bearing. The results proved that the decrease of the bearing length has a significant incidence on the minimum film thickness and maximum pressure due to the load capacity reduction.Because of too many parameters which affect the lubrication performances, it is hard to gain the comprehensive information, to overcome this difficult, many experimental runs need to carry out to evaluate the bearing performance. In order to reduce the number of experimental runs, the design of experiment method is researched recently. Francisco [8] used design of experiments to analyze the connecting rod big-end bearing behavior, and the main objective of the present work is to identify the factors dominating the bearing behavior. Smith [9] optimized the design of a piston-ring pack using design of experiment (DOE) methods. It is shown that an improved design can be achieved that reduces ring losses by 57% whilst reducing upward oil flow by 39%. Johansson [10] used the experiment to evaluate cylinder liner/piston ring contact friction, it is shown that for the introduced DOE based tribometer test the interaction of dynamic viscosity, velocity and contact pressure can be studied within one experiment.Apart from the researches about DOE, many researchers started to use the DOE to combine with intelligent algorithm to analyze the problem. Ko [11] applied artificial neural network and Taguchi method to preform design in metal forming considering workability. Papadopoulos [12] combined the experimental design with artificial neural networks to determine the chlorinated compounds in fish using matrix solid-phase dispersion, and the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed soft computing strategy is very effective and efficient to achieve satisfactory results. Benardos [13] Predicted the surface roughness in CNC face milling using neural networks and Taguchi's design of experiments, the data used for the training and checking of the networks’ performance derived from experiments conducted on a CNC milling machine according to the principles of Taguchi DoE method. Hao [14] analyze the parameter sensitivity on deformation of composite soil-nailed wall using artificial neural networks and orthogonal experiment, 25 sets of tests are designed to analyze the sensitivity of factors affecting the maximum lateral displacement of composite soil-nailing wall. Chang [15] presents a systematic and cost-effective approach for process optimization with minimal experimental runs, all the optimization is based on neural network model and orthogonal arrays, and the proposed approach provides an effective and economical solution for process optimization.From the literatures review, many researchers focused on the effect of parameters on lubrication, the dynamic lubrication characteristics or lubrication model. The purpose of this study is to numerically and roughly quantify the impact of each variable on the power loss, the flow rate, the MOFT and the MOFP. The knowledge required for this particular task implies a good understanding of the connecting rod. The orthogonal experiment is designed to do the research about the lubrication, parameters which response to the oil film thickness, the oil film pressure, the oil leakage and the friction loss are gained, the regression method is used to establish the prediction model which can bridge the gap between the recent numerical simulations and the need for a better understanding of the connecting rod bearing functioning. Considering the asperity contact can cause the friction loss to increase and the bearing to be failure earlier, the SVM technology is carried out to the asperity contact identification, which can help us to avoid asperity contact in the design.EHD lubrication analysis plays an important role in the design of dynamically loaded main bearings as it can offer more realistic prediction of the bearing performances. Apart from the bearing deformation, oil film cavitation is also very important to the bearing performance prediction. The earlier researchers Elrod and Adams [16], Vijayaraghavan and Keith [17] found cavitation phenomenon and established the cavitation model, then cavitation is researched widely. Boedo and Booker [18,19] investigated the effect of body force deformation and mass-conserving cavitation on the EHD behavior of connecting rod big-end bearings. Bonneau [20] and Optasanu [21] used a mass-conservative algorithm to simulate the EHD bearing behavior. The problem is solved analytically using Reynold's boundary conditions for film rupture. The governing equation concludes the full film region and cavitation region is rewritten as:(1)∂∂xθ′ϕxh312η∂p∂x+∂∂zθ′ϕyh312η∂p∂y=U1+U22∂∂xθ′h+θ′σϕs+∂(θ′h)∂twhereϕx,ϕzis the pressure flow factors along x, z direction,ϕsis the shear flow factor, σ is the composite rms roughness, θ′ is the filling factor.The effect of elastic displacements of the bearing surface has to be included in EHD model. The film thickness including this effect is written as:(2)h(β,z)=c−εx(y)cosβ−εz(y)sinβ+δ(β′,z)where c represents the original radical clearance at the underformed state, ɛxis the crankshaft deformation in x direction, ɛzis the crankshaft deformation in the z direction, δ(β′, z) is the radical deformation of the bearing, β′ is measured from bearing crown, β′=arctan (ɛz/ɛx) [22].The lubricant flow-rate Q1 from the front-end plane of the bearing and the lubricant flow-rate Q2 from rear end plane of the bearing are given by:(3)Q1=−∫0h∫02πRϕxh312η⋅∂p∂yy=0dxdy(4)Q2=−∫0h∫02πRϕyh312η⋅∂p∂yy=Ldxdywhere Q1 is the flow-rate from the front-end plane of the bearing, Q2 is flow-rate from rear end of the bearing.The total end leakage flow rate of lubricant is then calculated by:(5)Q=Q1+Q2Q is the total end leakage flow rate of lubricant.The friction loss is partitioned into hydrodynamic friction loss and asperity contact friction loss. The frictional force on the journal surface can be computed by:(6)f=∬(τa+τh)dAwhere τais the asperity contact shear force, τhis the fluid shear force.The friction power is the sum of the friction force that multiplies with its velocity at every time step and it is written as:(7)P=∑i=1nfiu′iwhere fi is the friction force of every mesh point,u′iis the velocity of every mesh pointWe use the Greenwood & Tripp approach [23], the theory of Greenwood & Tripp is based on the contact of two nominally flat, random roughness surfaces. The resulting asperity contact pressure is the product of elastic factor and function F5/2(H), asperity contact pressure is written as:(8)p(h)=16215π(ηsβδ)2E′δβF5/2(H)F5/2(H) is the switch function whether the asperity happens. The function F5/2(H) is written as:(9)F5/2(H)=4.486×10−5(4−h/σ)6.804h/σ<40h/σ≥4where E′ denotes the composite elastic modulus, E′=((1−v12)/E1+(1−v22)/E2)−1, where vi and Ei are the Poisson ratio and Young's modulus of the adjacent surfaces, respectively. ηs is the asperity density, β is the radius of curvature of convex peak, H is the dimensionless clearance parameter, H=H/σ. ηsβσ is in the region of 0.03–0.05, σ/β is always in the region of 10−4–10−2.Connecting rod consists of rod, cap, bolts, big-end bearing and small-end bushing. In this paper, the lubrication performances of the big-end bearing are analyzed, according realistic structure of the big-end bearing, there is no oil groove in the bearing, the oil supplied by the oil hole located in the crank-pin, so the effect of the oil groove on the lubrication performances is neglected, but the special oil groove in small-end bushing, in the future work, we will do the insight research to the groove, more detail results will be gained (Fig. 1).According to the Ref. [24], there are many failure modes which exist in the connecting rod lubrication and dynamic motion, three figures in the below (as shown in Fig. 2) are very typical failure mode, the asperity contact appears in the bearing.In order to add the deformation to the oil film thickness, the connecting rod structure needs to be flexible. Fig. 3is the flexible and solid connecting rod model and bearing substructure. The finite element mesh is very limited for the calculation. The big-end bearing and small-end bushing are meshed with hexahedron, in this paper, the density of the finite difference mesh is 19×121, and the density of the finite element mesh is 9×44, then the two-dimensional interpolation with transform matrix (as shown in Fig. 4) to realize this function.The engine general specifications are given in Table 1. The deformation of the big-end bearing has great relationship with its Young's modulus. So it is also the variable for the input.When the in-cylinder gas pressure applied on the piston head, the gas force is written as:(10)Fg(α)=πD24Pg(α)The initial force of the piston system is written as:(11)Fj=−mpiston+mrodlblRw2(cosα+λcos2α)(12)Frc=(l−lb)mrodrw2l(13)F=(Fg+Fj)cosβ(14)Fτ=Fsin(α+β)(15)Fn=Fcos(α+β)−FrcThe bearing load along x, y direction is written as:(16)Fx=−Fn(α)sinα+Fτ(α)cosα(17)Fy=−Fn(α)cosα−Fτ(α)sinαThe studied engine is a typical diesel engine, with a peak power at 2500rpm and peak torque at 2200rpm. The applied load to the big-end bearing is shown in Fig. 5.DOE is important as a formal way of maximizing information gained while minimizing required resources, especially for the orthogonal experiment. It has more to offer than “one change at a time” experimental methods because it allows a judgment on the significance to the output of input variables acting alone. It is useful to quantify the main effects of the input variables on global responses when optimizing a connecting rod big-end bearing. In this paper, 10 input variables with 4 different levels (as shown in Table 2), some outputs are selected to evaluate the lubrication performances, such as friction power loss, oil leakage, MOFT and MOFP (as shown in Table 3).10 input parameters, with 4 levels for each of them, imply a set of 410 runs for the whole experiment with one change at a time. Every experiment to do the simulation needs at least 1h, so 410h are needed to achieve our goal, to overcome this problem, we introduce the orthogonal experiment including one component (oil hole location) with 2 levels and 9 variables with 4 levels. L(2×49) the design is described as a 32 design of resolution. This means that an overall of n=10 factors are studied only needing more than 32h. However, the variables interaction is neglected in the experiment. In the future work, we will also design the experiment with variables interaction.y can be a particular response (e.g., friction loss, oil leakage, MOFP, MOFT) to the ten input variables x1, x2, …, x10, the response variable y related with the input variable is called a regression model which can be written as:(18)y=f(x1,x2,x3,…,x9,x10)If the regression model neglects the variable interaction, the linear regression model can be written as:(19)y=β0+β1x1+β2x2+β3x3+β4x4+β5x5+β6x6+β7x7+β8x8+β9x9+β10x10(20)SST=∑i=1n(yi−y¯)2,SSE=∑i=1n(yi−yˆ)2,SSR=∑i=1n(yˆi−y¯)2(21)R=SSRSSTThe linear regression model can simplify the calculation model, and eliminate the correlation between the regression coefficient and interaction, so it is widely used in all kinds of fields. However, some realistic problem needs to consider interaction between two variables or even high orders, sometimes, using quadric regression design to establish regression equation can satisfy the common nonlinear problem. In the future work, we will establish the nonlinear regression model.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Based on the dynamic simulation model of the connecting rod, the orthogonal experiment is designed to identify the factors dominating the bearing behavior, and the regression method is carried out to analyze the lubrication performances, such as MOFT, MOFP, FEMP and oil leakage. Response surface analysis is also introduced to the analysis of these performances considering the weight effect on these performances. The conclusions are summarized as follows:(1)The dynamic lubrication model is established. Different from tradition analysis method, we use the statistics method with suitable design of experiment to gain more information.Through the analysis of the oil film pressure distribution, filling ratio, asperity contact pressure distribution and oil film thickness. The above conclusion can be concluded: (1) The main load bearing region changes little during the expansion and exhaust strokes due to the in-cylinder pressure; (2) The oil film rupture region always appears in the position without fluid compressibility; (3) According to the asperity contact region and the fixture of the bush, the asperity contact is in accordance with the realistic mode.Two orthogonal experiments are combined to identify the factors dominating the bearing behavior. The effect weight of the above-mentioned ten factors on MOFT can be arranged in the following order: I>J>H>D>A>E>G>C>F>B; the dominating weight of the above-mentioned ten factors on MOFP can be arranged in the following order: G>J>A>B>H>F>D>I>C>E; The dominating weight of the above-mentioned ten factors on FMEP can be arranged in the following order: I>H>G>D>C>J>F>A>E>B. The dominating weight of the above-mentioned ten factors on the OLK can be arranged in the following order: G>I>A>F>C>H>E>D>B>J.Through the regression of the MOFT, MOFP, FEMP and oil leakage, four linear regression models are established, the effects weight of the ten factors have little difference to the orthogonal experiment through the significant analysis. After the significant analysis, the new regression models which are without insignificant components are established through the stepwise regression. Two most important variables are used as the input to carry out the surface response analysis. In future work, we will do insight research into the weight power difference.The SVM model is established to indentify the asperity contact, compared with SVM model, the PSO–SVM can predict the asperity contact more precisely, especially to the samples near the dividing line. In future work, we will establish the models that not only with identification function to asperity contact but also to the limitation of the lubrication performances. Apart from that, we will also establish the model with the prediction through the above process.
