@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this paper is to propose a new aggregation method to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problem which involves real numbers, interval numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs), trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs), linguistic values and Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (AIFNs). Firstly, motivated by the relative closeness of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), we propose a new general method for aggregating crisp values, TFNs, TrFNs and linguistic values into AIFNs. Thus all the group decision matrices for each alternative which involves heterogeneous information are transformed into an Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix which only contains AIFNs. To determine the attribute weights, a multiple objective Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy programming model is constructed and solved by converting it into a linear program. Subsequently, comparison analyses demonstrate that the proposed aggregated technology can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods. An example about cloud computing service evaluation is given to verify the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In cloud-based IT management, cloud computing service (CCS) evaluation problems have been extensively studied [1,2]. Since the real-life CCS provider selection problems often involve multiple attributes and actions such as costs, scope and performance, IT security, reliability, management capacity and flexibility, they may be ascribed to a kind of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems [3]. The increasing complexity of realistic social environment makes it difficult for a single decision maker (DM) or expert to consider factors of various aspects. Therefore, group decision making (GDM) has been the subject of intense research in decision science area [4]. In general, GDM with multiple conflicting attributes (criteria) are simply called the multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems [4]. However, in most practical MAGDM problems, since the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of the objects, the attribute values given by DMs are not always represented in the form of crisp values [1–4], and some are better suitable to be expressed in fuzzy values [5–13]. The two main representation types of fuzzy values are [5]: numeric case [6–8] and linguistic case [5,9–13]. Numeric cases which are used to measure quantitative attribute [14], may be interval numbers, Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (AIFNs) [6], triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) [7] and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) [8]. Linguistic cases which are used to measure qualitative attribute, may be fuzzy set linguistic representation and 2-Tuple linguistic representation [10]. In spite of being less precise than numerical values, linguistic values make expert judgment more reliable and informative and are more appropriate for representing approximate values that are too complex to be represented using precise numerical values [11].In general, the assessments may be measured in various types of attribute values (such as real numbers, fuzzy numbers and linguistic values) are called heterogeneous MAGDM problems by Chiclana et al. [15]. The heterogeneous MAGDM problem has been successfully applied to the fields of GDM [16,17], outsourcing [18], sustainable project selection [19], human resources performance evaluation [20], supply chain coordination [21], etc. The key to settling such problems is how to aggregate all individual decisions with heterogeneous information into collective one with uniformed information [15]. Following the lines of Chiclana et al. [15], many subsequent useful and valuable methods have been proposed to study the aggregation process in heterogeneous MAGDM. Those methods can be roughly classified into two categories:(1) The distances based methods [14,16,18,22–28]. Li et al. [14] proposed a systematic approach to solving heterogeneous MAGDM. In this method, the weighted Minkowski distance is used to measure differences between the alternative and both the negative and positive ideal solution, and the relative closeness degree of alternative is used to ranking the alternatives. Based on the reference distance, Ma et al. [22] developed a fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) decision support system, which can deal with different types of information including boolean values, linguistic terms and real numbers. Wan and Li [23] and Li and Wan [24,25] extended the Linear Programming Technique for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP) and presented fuzzy linear programming methods to solve heterogeneous multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. Wan and Li [26] defined the IFS-type consistency and inconsistency indices based on the Euclidean distances to the ideal solutions and proposed an Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy programming method for heterogeneous MAGDM with Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy truth degrees whose attribute values are described by real numbers, intervals, AIFNs and TrFNs. Further, Wan and Dong [27] put forward an interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy mathematical programming method for hybrid MCGDM with interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy truth degrees whose decision data are expressed in the forms of real numbers, intervals, AIFNs, TFNs and interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVAIFSs). Subsequently, Wan and Li [28] developed a new fuzzy mathematical programming method for solving heterogeneous MADM problems whose attribute values are presented by real numbers, interval numbers, linguistic values, TrFNs, IFSs, IVAIFSs. Zhang et al. [16] constructed a maximizing deviation model based on the distances to integrate the heterogeneous information, and then applied their method in strategic freight forwarder selection problem. The aforementioned distance based methods are seem to be effective to solve heterogeneous MAGDM. However, it should be pointed out that the final ranking indexes of all alternative obtained by these methods [14,16,18,22–28] are the distances to positive ideal solution or relative closeness. These ranking indexes are crisp values and cannot express the uncertainty and impreciseness of original decision information. Thus, information loss inevitably occurs in these methods.(2) The transformation techniques based methods [15,17,29–33]. To avoid information loss, several different transformation techniques [15,17,29–33] have been proposed for converting the heterogeneous information into the homogeneous information. In existing researches, the heterogeneous information is often transformed into fuzzy preference relation [15], 2-tuple linguistic set [29,30] or linguistic term set [31–33]. Taking fuzzy preference relations as a based representation, Chiclana et al. [15] presented some fuzzy transformation functions for dealing with heterogeneous information (including preference orderings, utility values and fuzzy preference relations). Herrera et al. [29] developed a method to unify the heterogeneous information composed of real numbers, interval numbers and linguistic values into the 2-tuple linguistic information. Then, the collective assessment for each alternative can be obtained by 2-tuple linguistic weighted average operator. Further, considering the experts’ social interactions and judgments, Pérez et al. [30] proposed three social network analysis 2-tuple linguistic based induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operators. Chuu [31] proposed a fusion method for converting different linguistic scales (multi-granularity linguistic term sets) and numerical scales into a basic linguistic term set. Based on the type-1 ordered weighted averaging (TIOWA) operator [32], Mata et al. [33] developed a new TIOWA methodology to consensus reaching processes in multi-granularity linguistic contexts, which can directly handle linguistic values with different cardinality and semantic without the need to perform any transformation to unify the information. Recently, Chen et al. [17] reviewed the fusion process with heterogeneous preference structures in GDM.As an extension of fuzzy sets, Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy (AIF) sets (AIFSs) [6] has better agility in expressing the uncertainty and ambiguity. However, the aforesaid literature survey reveals that there is no investigation on aggregating heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs [6] for the heterogeneous MAGDM problems. The signification for aggregating heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs can be explained by the following four facts: (1) AIFSs theory has attracted broad studies from different aspects [34]. Wu and Chiclana [35] proposed an attitudinal expected score function of AIFN, and used it to construct fuzzy preference relation (FPR) from a given intuitionistic FPR (IFPR). Furthermore, Wu and Chiclana [36] developed new attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions, and verified a set of properties. Wu and Chiclana [37] presented a consistency based procedure to estimate missing values in IFPRs. Ureña et al. [38] proved that the sets of reciprocal IFPRs and asymmetric FPRs are mathematically isomorphic. (2) AIFN has a wide application prospect. It has been extensively applied to various fields, such as clustering analysis [39], fingerprints authentication [40] and decision making [41–47], to name a few. (3) There are several transformation methods to defuzzify fuzzy number into a final crisp value, including the mean of maximum method and the center of area method [5,48]. However, these defuzzificaion methods present a limitation that a fuzzy number loses its fuzziness because the final crisp value ignores the shape of the resulting membership function [49]. (4) AIFN can deliver more useful information since it can describe the characteristics of affirmation, negation and hesitation simultaneously. For example, in an actual cloud computing service (CCS) [1,2] evaluation, the trustworthiness of a provider can be assessed by an AIFN (0.3, 0.4), which means that the trustworthy degree of CCS is 0.3, the untrustworthy degree is 0.4, and the indeterminacy is 0.3. However, it may be not easy to establish the crisp values for the membership and non-membership of AIFN because sufficient information is unavailable in real problems.In this paper, a key issue that needs to be addressed for heterogeneous MAGDM is how to integrate a heterogeneous group decision matrix into an AIF decision matrix, which is very interesting yet relatively sophisticated to dispose. There are two major difficulties and challenges in the process of aggregating heterogeneous information: (1) How to establish the dissatisfactory bounds and satisfactory bounds by the attribute (column) vector. It is usually difficult to distinguish the dissatisfaction and satisfaction of different formats of attribute values. (2) How to derive reasonably the membership degree, non-membership degree and hesitancy degree of attribute vector. These parameters are basic component elements of an AIFN, but it is difficult to make them satisfies the definition of an AIFN. Currently, there are some studies focused on aggregating crisp values into AIFN. For instance, Yue [44] and Yue et al. [45] employed Golden Section idea to aggregate crisp values into AIFN. Yue et al. [46] proposed the method based on Minimax Criterion to aggregate crisp values into AIFN for MAGDM. More recently, Yue [47] developed a new useful and practical method for aggregating crisp values into AIFN, which is simpler in the sense of calculation. Although these aggregation methods [44–47] have some advantages, there are some limitations:(1)The aggregation technique of Yue [47] may lead to some unreasonable results (see the cases discussed in Section 5.1 in detail).The MAGDM problems in [46,47] only considered single type of attribute values, i.e., real numbers. The aggregation techniques proposed in [44–47] cannot be used to aggregate heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs. As a result, the methods [46,47] are not suitable to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problems.The weights of attributes are given by DMs in advance in methods [44–47]. In real-world decision making problems, it is not easy for DMs to allocate weights to different attributes accurately.To overcome the aforementioned major difficulties and limitations, this paper focuses on an aggregation method to deal with the heterogeneous MAGDM problems. The primary innovations and contributions are outlined as follows: (1) a new distance based differentiation method is first put forward to determine the dissatisfaction and satisfaction of assessments; (2) a relative closeness based transformation method is constructed to derive the basic component elements of AIFN; (3) a new method is developed to solve the heterogeneous MAGDM problems in which the decision information is expressed as real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs, TrFNs, linguistic values and AIFNs.The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. The next section briefly recalls some basic concepts on AIFSs, interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs. Section 3 describes the heterogeneous MAGDM problems, and presents a general method to aggregate heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs. In Section 4, the attribute weights are determined objectively by constructing a multiple objective AIF programming. Thus, a new method is proposed to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problems. In Section 5, comparison analyses are made with existing methods. Section 6 provides a numerical example to illustrate the feasibility and reasonableness of the proposed method. Section 7 makes our conclusions.In this section, some basic concepts related to AIFSs [6], interval numbers, TFNs [4,7] and TrFNs [8] are reviewed.Definition 1[6]. LetA˜={<x,μA˜(x),vA˜(x)>x∈X}be an AIFS in X, whereμA˜(x):X→[0,1]andvA˜(x):X→[0,1], with the conditionμA˜(x)+μA˜(x)∈[0,1]. The parametersμA˜(x)andvA˜(x)indicate, respectively, the membership degree and non-membership degree of the element x inA˜. The third parameterπA˜(x)=1−μA˜(x)−vA˜(x), x∈X is called hesitation degree or Atanassov's intuitionistic index of x inA˜[6]. Obviously,πA˜(x)∈[0,1],x∈X.For convenience, Xu [50] callsα˜=(μα˜,vα˜)an AIFN or an Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy value (AIFV), where(1)μα˜∈[0,1],vα˜∈[0,1],μα˜+vα˜∈[0,1],μα˜+vα˜+πα˜=1.It is clear that the largest and smallest AIFN are α+=(1, 0) and α−=(0, 1), respectively.Letα˜1=(μα˜1,vα˜1)andα˜2=(μα˜2,vα˜2)be two AIFNs, then1)α˜1+α˜2=(μα˜1+μα˜2−μα˜1μα˜2,vα˜1vα˜2),λα˜1=(1−(1−μα˜1)λ,vα˜1λ),λ>0.Using the continuous Archimedean t-norm and its dual t-conorm, Beliakov et al. [51] proposed the following weighted averaging operater for AIFNs (AIWAM). Beliakov et al. [51] also proved that AIWAM is monotone with respect to the order based the score function [52] and accuracy function [53].Definition 2[51]. For a set of AIFNsα˜i(i=1, 2, …, n) that have associated an importance weight vectorw={w1,w2,…,wn}Twithwi∈[0,1](i=1, 2, …, n) and∑i=1nwi=1. We call:Definition 3[52]. Letα˜=(μα˜,vα˜)be an AIFN. A score functions(α˜)ofα˜can be represented as follows:[53]. Letα˜=(μα˜,vα˜)be an AIFN. An accuracy functionh(α˜)ofα˜can be represented as follows:[50]. Ifα˜1=(μα˜1,vα˜1)andα˜2=(μα˜2,vα˜2)are any two AIFNs, then:1)Ifs(α˜1)<s(α˜2), thenα˜1≺XYα˜2.Ifs(α˜1)=s(α˜2), then:Ifh(α˜1)=h(α˜2), thenα˜1∼XYα˜2.Ifh(α˜1)<h(α˜2), thenα˜1≺XYα˜2.Denote by L([0, 1]) the set of all closed subintervals of unit interval. Bustince et al. [54] introduced and studied the notion of admissible orders on L([0, 1]). Let(L([0,1]),≺_)be a poset, [a, b]∈L([0, 1]), [c, d]∈L([0, 1]), the order≺_is an admissible order if it is a linear order and[a,b]≺_[c,d]whenever a≤c and b≤d. It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between L([0, 1]) and the set of all AIFNs:(μα˜,vα˜)↔[μα˜,1−vα˜], so the three admissible orders of AIFNs are listed as follows:(i)α˜1≺_Lex1α˜2⇔(μα˜1<μα˜2)∨(μα˜1=μα˜2∧vα˜1≥vα˜2).α˜1≺_Lex2α˜2⇔(vα˜1>vα˜2)∨(vα˜1=vα˜2∧μα˜1≤μα˜2).α˜1≺_XYα˜2⇔(μα˜1−vα˜1<μα˜2−vα˜2)∨(μα˜1−vα˜1=μα˜2−vα˜2∧μα˜1+vα˜1≤μα˜2+vα˜2).In practice, selecting which order to rank AIFNs is more complicated because DMs act and react on the basis of their perceptions. For instance, if the DM's attitudinal character becomes pessimistic, the order≺_Lex1may be more suitable. Conversely, if the DM's attitudinal character becomes optimistic, the order≺_Lex2should be chosen. When the DM's attitudinal character becomes neutral, we can use≺_XY. Moreover, from Definition 5, we have≺_XY=≺XY∪∼≺XY.However, in many cases, we do not know this information. In order to determine the most appropriate order, Bustince et al. [55] proposed a Shapley value approach to make clear the importance of the choice of the order between intervals. Motivated by the Shapley value approach [55], the method to rank AIFNs with different orders is presented as follows:1) If with all the considered orders we get the same ranking results, then we can decide the best one straightforwardly.2) If two AIFNsα˜1andα˜2are located in different positions by means of different orders, then their final positions can be determine by the frequency of one being preferred to the other. Ifα˜2≺_α˜1andα˜1≺_α˜2generate the same frequency, then we can translate AIFNs into intervals, and apply the Shapley value in [55] to choose the best one.Definition 6[7]. Leta1=[a1l,a1u]anda2=[a2l,a2u]be two nonnegative interval numbers, and λ≥0, then1)a1+a2=[a1l+a2l,a1u+a2u];λa1=[λa1l,λa1u].The Hamming distance measure between two nonnegative interval numbersa1=[a1l,a1u]anda2=[a2l,a2u]is defined as follows:(5)dIN(a1,b1)=12(|a1l−a2l|+|a1u−a2u|).Definition 7[7]. Let a=(a1, a2, a3) and b=(b1, b2, b3) be two TFNs, and λ≥0, then1)a+b=(a1+b1, a2+b2, a3+b3),λa=(λa1, λa2, λa3).The Hamming distance measure between two TFNs a=(a1, a2, a3) and b=(b1, b2, b3) is defined as follows [7]:(6)dTFN(a,b)=13(|a1−b1|+|a2−b2|+|a3−b3|).Definition 8[8]. Let a=(a1, a2, a3, a4) and b=(b1, b2, b3, b4) be two TrFNs, and λ≥0, then1)a+b=(a1+b1, a2+b2, a3+b3, a4+b4),λa=(λa1, λa2, λa3, λa4).The Hamming distance measure between two TrFNs a=(a1, a2, a3, a4) and b=(b1, b2, b3, b4) is defined as follows:(7)dTrFN(a,b)=14(|a1−b1|+|a2−b2|+|a3−b3|+|a4−b4|).In this section, we first describe the heterogeneous MAGDM problem and then propose a general method for aggregating heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs.For convenience, denote M={1, 2, …, m}, N={1, 2, …, n}, and P={1, 2, …, p}. Let Di(i∈M) be a group of DMs, Sk(k∈P) be a discrete set of alternatives, and Aj(j∈N) be a set of attributes. Suppose that the rating of alternative Skwith respect to the attribute Ajgiven by DM Dibe denoted byxijk(i∈M, j∈N, k∈P). Since there are multiple formats of rating values, the attribute set A={A1, A2, …, An} is divided into six subsetsAˆ1={A1,A2,…,Aj1},Aˆ2={Aj1+1,Aj1+2,…,Aj2},Aˆ3={Aj2+1,Aj2+2,…,Aj3},Aˆ4={Aj3+1,Aj3+2,…,Aj4},Aˆ5={Aj4+1,Aj4+2,…,Aj5}andAˆ6={Aj5+1,Aj5+2,…,An}, where 1≤j1≤j2≤j3≤j4≤j5≤n,Aˆt∩Aˆk=∅(t, k=1, 2, …, 6;t≠k) and⋃t=16Aˆt=A, ∅ is an empty set. The rating values in the subsetsAˆe(e=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are in the form of real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs, TrFNs, linguistic terms and AIFNs, respectively. Denote the subscript sets for subsetsAˆe(e=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) by N1={1, 2, …, j1}, N2={j1+1, j1+2, …, j2}, N3={j2+1, j2+2, …, j3}, N4={j3+1, j3+2, …, j4}, N5={j4+1, j4+2, …, j5} and N6={j5+1, j5+2, …, n}, respectively. Hence, a group decision matrix of alternative Skcan be expressed as(8)Xk=(xijk)m×n=A1A2⋯AnD1D2⋮Dmx11kx12k⋯x1nkx21kx22k⋯x2nk⋮⋮⋮⋮xm1kxm2k⋯xmnk(k∈P)wherexijkis the attribute value of alternative Skon attribute Ajgiven by DM Di.Denote the attribute weight vector byw=(w1,w2,…,wn), wherewjrepresents the weight of attribute Ajsuch thatwj∈[0,1](j∈N) and∑j=1nwj=1. In some real decision situations, the DMs may specify some preference relations on weights of attributes according to his/her knowledge, experience and judgment [27]. Such information of attribute weights is incomplete. Let Ω be the incomplete weight information set. Generally, Ω may consist of several basic forms [23–27]:1)A weak ranking:{wi≥wj};A strict ranking:{wi−wj≥εi}(ɛi>0);An interval form:{εi≤wi≤εi+ϕi}(0≤ɛi≤ɛi+ϕi≤1);A ranking of differences:{wi−wj≥wk−wl}, for j≠k≠l;A ranking with multiples:{wi≥εiwj}(0≤ɛi≤1).Followed by Yue [44–47], we integrate the decision matricesXk=(xijk)m×n(k=1, 2, …, p) into a collective AIF decision matrix in order to derive the ranking order of alternatives. A general method for aggregating heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs is proposed in the following section.To facilitate the calculation, the jth column vector inXkis rewritten by Eq. (9) as follows:(9)Akj=(x1jk,x2jk,…,xmjk)(k∈P,j∈N),which is the assessment vector of alternative Skon attribute Ajgiven by all DMs Di(i=1, 2, …, m). LetAjmin,AjmidandAjmax, respectively, be the smallest grade, the middle grade and the largest grade employed in rating system (for example, in the ten-mark system for the assessment of real numbers, if attribute Ajis benefit attribute, thenAjmin=0,Ajmid=5andAjmax=10; if attribute Ajis cost attribute, thenAjmin=10,Ajmid=5andAjmax=0). Note that the elements ofAkjare always betweenAjminandAjmax.To integrate the decision matricesXk=(xijk)m×n(k=1, 2, …, p) into a collective AIF decision matrix, all the attribute values in vectorAkjneed to be aggregated into an AIFN. To this end, we introduce some concepts including the Quasi-satisfactory value (Qsv), Quasi-dissatisfactory value (Qdv) and Quasi-uncertain value (Quv) ofAkj. Then, using the relative closeness of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [56], three new transformations are developed to transform the Qsv, Qdv and Quv into the Quasi-membership degree (Qmd), Quasi-non-membership degree (Qnmd) and Quasi-hesitancy degree (Qhd), respectively. Finally, an AIFN is induced from the Qmd, Qnmd and Qhd by the proposed normalized method.Ifxijkis a real number with the normalization-mark system (i.e.,xijkbelongs to [0,1]), then the “dissatisfaction” and “satisfaction” inAkjcan be easily distinguished by the midpoint “0.5”. The DM who usesxijk∈[0,0.5)is dissatisfaction; the DM who usesxijk∈(0.5,1]is satisfaction; the DM who usesxijk=0.5is uncertain [57]. However, ifAkjis a fuzzy number vector, the bound is hard to establish for distinguishing the “dissatisfaction” and “satisfaction” inAkj. To incorporate fuzzy number in our method, for everyxijkinAkj, we notice that (1) the distance fromxijktoAjminis greater than the distance fromxijktoAjmax, which shows that the DM prefers satisfaction; (2) the distance fromxijktoAjminis less than the distance fromxijktoAjmax, which shows that the DM prefers dissatisfaction; and (3) the distance fromxijktoAjminis equal to the distance fromxijktoAjmax, which shows that the DM maintains neutrality.Based on the above analysis, we introduce Definition 9 to judge the elements inAkjare satisfactory or dissatisfactory.Definition 9For the benefit attribute vectorAkj, the satisfactory setAkjuand dissatisfactory setAkjlare defined asConsidering the heterogeneous information in the decision matrixXk, in this paper the satisfactory setAkjuand dissatisfactory setAkjlare defined by using the distanced(xijk,Ajmax)andd(xijk,Ajmin). Whereas, in [44–47],AkjuandAkjlare identified by a real number 0.5 since only single type of information (i.e., real numbers) is considered in [44–47].To obtain an induced AIFN from the attribute vectorAkj, we first define the Qsv, Qdv and Quv of alternative Skon attribute Ajbased on the satisfactory setAkjuand dissatisfactory setAkjl.Definition 10For the benefit attribute vectorAkj, the Qsv, Qdv and Quv of alternative Skon attribute Ajare defined asFor the benefit attribute vectorAkj, the uncertain setAkjπis defined asFor a normalized scale system with the assessments of real numbers (the grades from 0 to 1 are used), depicted in Fig. 1, if we move from point A toward point M, the dissatisfaction decreases (from 1 at point A to 0 at point M), then the uncertainty increased (from 0 at point A to 1 at point M). In other words, point M is the most uncertain or the fuzziest. Likewise, for the segment MB, the satisfaction increased (from 0 at point M to 1 at point B), the uncertainty decreases (from 1 at point M to 0 at point B). In this sense, Yue [47] developed three linear transformations for ξkj, ζkjand ηkjrespectively. However, Yue [47] seems to suffer from some limitations: (1) Yue [47] is feasible only for normalized real numbers. (2) Yue [47] cannot handle others formats of rating information, such as interval numbers, TFNs, TrFNs, etc.To overcome these drawbacks, we define three new transformations considering the following facts: (1) the largest gradeAjmaxis the satisfactory idea solution; (2) the smallest gradeAjminis the dissatisfactory idea solution; (3) the middle gradeAjmidis the uncertain idea solution. By using the relative closeness, three new transformations for ξkj, ζkjand ηkjare respectively defined to derive the Qmd κkj, Qnmd ςkjand Qhd τkjof alternative Skon attribute Aj.Definition 12For the benefit attribute vectorAkj, the Qmd κkj, Qnmd ςkjand Qhd τkjof alternative Skon attribute Ajare defined asIt is easy to see that the range of the parameters κkj, ςkj, τkjbelongs to the interval [0,1]. These transformations can be illustrated with Figs. 1 and 2.Yue [47] induced an AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)through directly normalizing κkj, ςkjand, τkj, i.e.,μkj=κkjκkj+ςkj+τkjandvkj=ςkjκkj+ςkj+τkj. Such a normalization method may leads to some unreasonable results (see some examples in Section 4 for details). In our opinion, the main cause of these unreasonable results is that this normalization method did not take into account the number of elements in the satisfactory set, dissatisfactory set and uncertain set. To incorporate theAkju,AkjlandAkjπinto the final induced AIFN, we utilize the cardinalities ofAkju,AkjlandAkjπto weight the κkj, ςkj, τkjfor inducing an AIFN.Definition 13For the attribute vectorAkj, the membership degree μkj, non-membership degreevkjand hesitancy degree πkjare defined asApparently, μkj,vkjand πkjsatisfy the conditions μkj∈[0, 1],vkj∈[0,1],μkj+vkj∈[0,1]andμkj+vkj+πkj=1. Thus,rkj=(μkj,vkj)is an AIFN. Namely, all the attribute values in vectorAkjare aggregated into an AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj).For the sake of simplicity, without loss of generality, suppose that all the attributes are benefit attributes in this section.If j∈N1, thenAkj=(x1jk,x2jk,…,xmjk)is attribute value vector of real numbers (i.e.,xijk(i=1, 2, …, m) are real numbers). LetAjmin=0,Ajmax=xj+(j∈N1), wherexj+means the largest grade for the attributeAj∈Aˆ1. By Definition 9, we haveAkju={xijk|xijk>12xj+,xijk∈Akj}andAkjl={xijk|xijk<12xj+,xijk∈Akj}(j∈N1, k∈P).Based on Eqs. (10)–(12), we have(19)ξkj=∑xijk∈AkjuxijkAkjuAkju>0,12xj+Akju=0(20)ζkj=∑xijk∈Akjlxijk|Akj1l|Akjl>0,12xj+Akjl=0,(21)ηkj=12(ξkj+ζkj).Remark 2IfAkjis a normalized attribute vector, then we haveAkju={xijk|xijk>0.5,xijk∈Akj},Akjl={xijk|xijk<0.5,xijk∈Akj}(j∈N1, k∈P),xj+=1, Eqs. (19)–(21) reduce toIt yields from Eqs. (13)–(15) that(22)κkj=2ξkj−xj+xj+,(23)ςkj=xj+−2ζkjxj+,(24)τkj=ηkj−ζkj12xj+−ζkj,ηkj<12xj+,ξkj1−ηkj1ξkj−12xj+,ηkj>12xj+,1,ηkj=12xj+.Remark 3Whenxj+=1, Eqs. (22)–(24) reduce to Eqs. (18)–(20) of Yue [47]. Namely, these transformations (Eqs. (22)–(24)) are degenerated to Eqs. (18)–(20) of [47] if the values ofAkjare normalized real numbers. Thus, the proposed transformation methods are more general. Moreover, the linear transformations of Yue [47] are only suitable to normalized real numbers, while the proposed transformation method in this paper can be used to deal with interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs.By Definition 11, we haveAkjπ={xijk|ζkj≤xijk≤ξkj,xijk∈Akj}(j∈N1, k∈P). Combined Eqs. (22)–(24) with Eqs. (16)–(18), the induced AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)forAkj(j∈N1) can be obtained.Remark 4If we do not consider the cardinality factors of the setsAkju,AkjlandAkjπ, then Definition 13 is reduced to Definition 5 of Yue [47]. Thus, the proposed method generalizes the method [47], the latter is just a special case of the former.If j∈N2, thenAkj=(x1jk,x2jk,…,xmjk)is a attribute value vector of interval numbers (i.e.,xijk=[x_ijk,x¯ijk](i=1, 2, …, m) are interval numbers). LetAjmin=[0,0],Ajmax=[xj+,xj+](j∈N2), wherexj+means the largest grade for the attributeAj∈Aˆ2. By Eq. (5) and Definition 9, we haveAkju={xijk|x_ijk+x¯ijk>xj+,xijk∈Akj}andAkjl={xijk|x_ijk+x¯ijk<xj+,xijk∈Akj}(j∈N2, k∈P).Plugging Eq. (5) in Eqs.

Combined Eqs. (28)–(30) with Eqs. (16)–(18), the induced AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)forAkjcan be obtained.If j∈N3, thenAkj=(x1jk,x2jk,…,xmjk)is a attribute value vector of TFNs (i.e.,xijk=(aijk,bijk,cijk)(i=1, 2, …, m) are TFNs). LetAjmin=(0,0,0),Ajmax=(xj+,xj+,xj+)(j∈N3), wherexj+means the largest grade for the attributeAj∈Aˆ3. By Eq. (6) and Definition 9, we haveAkju={xijk|aijk+bijk+cijk>32xj+,xijk∈Akj}andAkjl={xijk|aijk+bijk+cijk<32xj+,xijk∈Akj}(j∈N3, k∈P).Plugging Eq. (6) in Eqs.

Combined Eqs. (34)–(36) with Eqs. (16)–(18), the induced AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)forAkj(j∈N3) can be obtained.If j∈N4, thenAkj=(x1jk,x2jk,…,xmjk)is a attribute value vector of TrFNs (i.e.,xijk=(aijk,bijk,cijk,dijk)(i=1, 2, …, m) are TrFNs). LetAjmin=(0,0,0,0),Ajmax=(xj+,xj+,xj+,xj+)(j∈N4), wherexj+means the largest grade for the attributeAj∈Aˆ4of TrFNs. By Eq.

Combined Eqs. (40)–(42) with Eqs. (16)–(18), the generated AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)forAkj(j∈N4) can be obtained.Suppose that the rating values of attribute vectorAkj(j∈N5) are expressed as linguistic values. Several researchers [5,19] indicated that TrFNs are most appropriate to help the experts expressing the vagueness of such linguistic values, since they are more general than TFNs and interval numbers. Here, the used linguistic values are five-point rating scales, i.e., Rather Inferior, Inferior, Medium, Good and Rather Good. For ten-mark system, the corresponding relationship between TrFNs and linguistic values is listed in Table 1[19].Duo to the linguistic values can be converted to TrFNs, the generated AIFNrkj=(μkj,vkj)forAkj(j∈N5) can be obtained by using Section 3.3.4.Using the aggregation method developed in Section 3, the decision matricesXk=(xijk)m×n(k=1, 2, …, p) can be transformed into a collective AIF decision matrix, i.e.,(43)X=(rkj)p×n=A1A2⋯AnS1S2⋮Sp(μ11,v11)(μ12,v12)⋯(μ1n,v1n)(μ21,v21)(μ22,v22)⋯(μ2n,v2n)⋮⋮⋮⋮(μp1,vp1)(μp2,vp2)⋯(μpn,vpn),whererkj=(μkj,vkj)(k∈P,j∈N)is an induced AIFN aggregated by the attribute vectorAkjinXk.If the attribute weight vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)is completely known, the collective overall ratingrk=(μk,vk)of the alternative Skcan be calculated by Eq. (2), where(44)μk=∑j=1nwjμkj,vk=∑j=1nwjvkj.Since the attribute weight vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)is incompletely known, we develop a new AIF programming model to determine the weights of attribute in the sequel.The largerrk=(μk,vk), the better the alternative Sk. Thus, it is reasonable to determine the attribute weights through maximizing the collective overall ratingrk=(μk,vk). Consequently, a multiple objective AIF mathematical programming model is constructed as follows:(45)max{rk}(k∈P)s.t.w∈ΩAs per Definition 1, the bigger μkand at the same time the smallervk, the largerrk=(μk,vk). Therefore, Eq. (45) can be transformed into the following multiple objective programming model:(46)max{μk}(k∈P)min{vk}(k∈P)s.t.w∈Ω.Plugging Eq. (44) into Eq. (46), Eq. (46) can be converted into the following multiple objective linear programming model:(47)max{Z1k(w)=∑j=1nwjμkj}(k∈P)min{Z2k(w)=∑j=1nwjvkj}(k∈P)s.t.w∈ΩTo solve a multiple objective programming, there are several solution methods. Here, we employ membership function-based linear sum approach to solving Eq. (47). Assume thatZtkmaxandZtkmin(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, …, p) are the maximum and minimum values of the single objective function Ztk(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, …, p) ignoring the others in Eq. (47). The corresponding linear membership functions of the objective functions Ztkare defined as follows:(48)μ1k(w)=1ifZ1k<Z1kmin(Z1k−Z1kmin)/(Z1kmax−Z1kmin)ifZ1kmin≤Z1k≤Z1kmax0ifZ1k>Z1kmax(k=1,2,…,p)(49)μ2k(w)=1ifZ2k<Z2kmin(Z2kmax−Z2k)/(Z2kmax−Z2kmin)ifZ2kmin≤Z2k≤Z2kmax0ifZ2k>Z2kmax(k=1,2,…,p)Then, Eq. (47) can be solved by the following linear programming model:(50)max∑k=1p[λ1kμ1k(w)+λ2kμ2k(w)]s.t.w∈Ωwhere λtk(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, …, p) are the weights of objective Ztk(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, …, p) such that λtk∈[0, 1] and∑k=1p(λ1k+λ2k)=1. If there is no any preference information for the objectives, the objective weights can take equal values, i.e.,λtk=12p(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, …, p). It is easily seen that the optimal solution of Eq. (50) is a Pareto optimal solution of Eq. (45). By solving Eq. (50), we can obtain the attribute weights.Remark 5To determine the optimal attribute weights in Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy environment, we firstly construct a multiple objective AIF programming that maximizes the collective AIFN of each alternative, whereas Chen and Yang [41] constructed a multiple objective optimization model that maximize the weighted similarity of each alternative to the ideal solution, Xia [42] proposed a objective optimization model based on the entropy and cross entropy, Li [58] constructed a linear programming model that minimize the group inconsistency index. Thus, the essential difference is that the present model is a multi-objective AIF programming model which belongs to fuzzy mathematical programming models, while those in previous works are linear programming models.Based on the above analysis, the primary steps for solving heterogeneous MAGDM problems can be summarized as follows:Step 1. Collect the alternatives rating values for each attribute and expert, and form the group decision matrixXk=(x˜ijk)m×n, by Eq. (8).Step 2. Transform the linguistic values into the corresponding TrFNs according to Table 1. Identify the smallest grade and the largest grade of the attribute vector, and convert the cost attribute value into benefit attribute value using the following equation:(51)x˜ij'k=xj+−xijkifj∈N1c[xj+−x¯ijk,xj+−x_ijk]ifj∈N2c(xj+−cijk,xj+−bijk,xj+−aijk)ifj∈N3c(xj+−dijk,xj+−cijk,xj+−bijk,xj+−aijk)ifj∈N4c(vijk,μijk)ifj∈N6c,wherexj+is the largest grade of the attribute Aj,Nic(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 6) means the subscript set of cost attributes in subsetAˆi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 6).Step 3. Convert the decision matricesX′k=(x′˜ijk)m×n(k=1, 2, …, p) into a collective AIF decision matrixX=(rkj)p×n. In detail, for the attribute Aj(j∈Nii=1, 2, 3, 4) we use the methods in Section 3 respectively, while for the attribute Aj(j∈N6) we use the AIWAM operator.Step 4. Construct the multiple objective AIF programming model (i.e., Eq. (45)) and convert it into the linear programming model (i.e., Eq. (50)).Step 5. Determine the attribute weights by solving Eq. (50).Step 6. Derive the collective overall rating rkof each alternative Sk(k∈P) by Eq. (2).Step 7. Rank the alternatives and select the best one according to the method presented in Section 2.2.The schematic structure of the proposed algorithm is graphically illustrated in Fig. 3.To illustrate the superiority of the method proposed in this paper, comparison analyses between the proposed method and existing methods [44–47] are made in this section.To clarify the drawbacks of Yue's method [47], Table 2presents some computation results of cases by using the method [47] and the proposed method(1) The method [47] may lead to some unreasonable computation results. For example, in Case 1 in Table 2, A=(0.2, 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, 0.93) and B=(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.93) are two normalized benefit attribute value vector of real numbers. By applying the proposed method, we obtain the induced AIFNs rA=(0.577, 0.081) and rB=(0.134, 0.468). Thus, A>B, which is consistent with intuition. However, by the method [47], we derive the induced AIFNs rA=rB=(0.372, 0.259). Thus, A=B, which is unreasonable since the vector A is remarkably different from the vector B. Another type of counter-intuitive Case 2 occurs when A=(0.5, 0.9, 0.93, 0.88, 0.8, 0.93) and B=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.93). By applying the proposed method, we have rA=(0.788, 0) and rB=(0.364, 0). Thus A>B, which is consistent with intuition. However, by the method [47], we derive rA=(0.608, 0) and rB=(0.632, 0). Thus, A<B, which is also unreasonable. Therefore, the proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of method [47].(2) For non-normalized real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs (i.e., Case 3, Case 4, Case 5 and Case 6), the method [47] are invalid. Namely, the method [47] can only aggregate the normalized real numbers into AIFNs.(3) If the values of attribute vector are normalized real numbers, and the cardinalities of the satisfactory and dissatisfactory in vector are not taken into consideration, then the aggregation method (i.e., Eqs. (10)–(18)) developed in this paper may be reduced to that of method [47] (i.e., Eqs. (17)–(21) in method [47]). Thus, the proposed method generalizes the method [47].To theoretically compare with existing methods [44–47] in detail, we make comparison analyses from twelve aspects, including attribute values, solved problem, attribute weight, distribution center, Qsv, Qdv, Quv, satisfactory set, dissatisfactory set, uncertain set, transformation and induced AIFN. Table 3lists the comparisons with methods [44–47]. From Table 3, the propose method has the following advantages.(1)The methods [44–47] just accommodate to aggregate normalized real numbers into an AIFN, whereas the proposed method is appropriate for more complicated attribute values, including normalized or non-normalized real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs (i.e., Case 3, Case 4, Case 5 and Case 6 in Table 2). Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problems while the methods [44–47] cannot.In aggregation process, the proposed method distinguishes the satisfaction and dissatisfaction through using the distancesd(xijk,Ajmax)andd(xijk,Ajmin), whereas the methods [44–47] distinguish the satisfaction and dissatisfaction through real number 0.5, which results in the methods [44–47] can only handle real number attribute vectors. However, the attribute values in the proposed method may be real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs. Hence, the proposed method has wider application scope than the methods [44–47].The proposed method objectively determines the attribute weights by constructing a multiple objective AIF mathematical programming model, whereas the attribute weights of the methods [44–47] are given in advance. It is very difficult to avoid subjective randomness while giving attribute weights a priori.In this section, a cloud computing service (CCS) evaluation example is analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics (JUFE) is situated in the city of NanChang in China's central province of JiangXi. JUFE is jointly governed and sponsored by the government of Jiangxi Province, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance. It has been a comprehensive institution of higher learning focusing on economics and management. Since its founding in 1923, JUFE has turned out more than 200000 undergraduates and graduates. The number of teaching staff and students are currently 1564 and 40000, respectively. Cloud computing service (CCS) has lately received utterly attention in computer and information science fields [1,2]. Recently, JUFE is planning to integrate CCS to its information systems to improve the elasticity of resources usage, quality of e-learning and efficiency of software tools. In this way, JUFE can provide ubiquitous access to education resources and services for students, teachers, researchers and administrators.To save deployment cost and insure the stability of cloud service, JUFE intends to select the best service provider from four CCS providers, Tencent (S1), Huawei (S2), Baidu (S3) and Alibaba (S4). A DM team, composing of five experts, is assembled to design the decision attributes. Considering the physical demand of JUFE, the DM team establishes six attributes after an in-depth discussion. These attributes are Costs (A1), Scope and performance (A2), IT security and compliance (A3), Reliability and trustworthiness (A4), Management capacity (A5) and Flexibility (A6), in which A1 is cost attribute, the latter five attributes are benefit attributes, and A2 and A3 are a qualitative attribute. For more details regarding attributes, refer to [1]. Due to the dynamic change of cost, the ratings of A1 are suitably represented by interval numbers. The ratings of A2 are divided into two parts: dissatisfaction degree and satisfaction degree, which are essentially the non-membership degree and membership degree of AIFN. Namely, the ratings of A2 are described by AIFNs. It is more natural and reasonable to use linguistic values to assess the attributes A3. The assessments of A4 are expressed by TFNs. The ratings of the CCS providers on A5 can be represented by real numbers. The assessments of A6 are can be expressed with TrFNs. Experts adopt the ten-mark system to assess the four candidate CCS providers based on these attributes. The ratings of all CCS providers on every attribute given by each expert are listed in Table 4. The attributes’ importance is incomplete and DMs gives the incomplete information on the attributes’ importance as follows:Ω=w1≥0.1;w1−w4≤0.1;w2≤0.2;w2−w6≥0.05;2w3≥w5;w1+w3+w4≤0.6;w4−w5≥0.05;w5≥0.05;w6≥0.05.Obviously, the decision problem mentioned above is a heterogeneous MAGDM problem involving five different formats of data: real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs, TrFNs, linguistic values and AIFNs. To solve this problem, we utilize the proposed aggregation approach to the selection of the CCS providers below.Step 1. The group decision matrices are listed in Table 4.Step 2. Since the attributes are assessed based on the tem-mark system, we have(52)Ajmin=0ifj∈N1[0,0]ifj∈N2(0,0,0)ifj∈N3(0,0,0,0)ifj∈N4,Ajmax=10ifj∈N1[10,10]ifj∈N2(10,10,10)ifj∈N3(10,10,10,10)ifj∈N4,We use Eq. (51) to transform the cost attribute value to benefit attribute value. The transformation results are listed in Table 5.Step 3. Using the aggregation method developed in Section 3, we can derive the aggregated AIFNs corresponding to the attribute vectors, which are shown in Table 6.Step 4. According to Eq. (45), a multiple objective AIF programming model is expressed as follows:(53)max{r1=(0.671,0.126)w1+(0.528,0.370)w2+(0.457,0.144)w3+(0.508,0.187)w4+(0.423,0.103)w5+(0.211,0.565)w6}max{r2=(0.455,0.182)w1+(0.700,0.060)w2+(0.695,0.095)w3+(0.254,0.415)w4+(0.643,0.066)w5+(0.128,0.446)w6}max{r3=(0.576,0.085)w1+(0.400,0.590)w2+(0.533,0.328)w3+(0.540,0.091)w4+(0.585,0.051)w5+(0.406,0.144)w6}max{r4=(0.188,0.188)w1+(0.596,0.330)w2+(0.311,0.401)w3+(0.147,0.452)w4+(0.569,0.116)w5+(0.111,0.563)w6}s.t.w∈ΩAccording to Eq. (48) and (49), Eq. (53) can be changed into the following multiple objective linear programming model:(54)min{Z11=0.671w1+0.528w2+0.457w3+0.508w4+0.423w5+0.211w6}min{Z12=0.455w1+0.700w2+0.695w3+0.254w4+0.643w5+0.128w6}min{Z13=0.576w1+0.400w2+0.533w3+0.540w4+0.585w5+0.406w6}min{Z14=0.188w1+0.596w2+0.311w3+0.147w4+0.569w5+0.111w6}min{Z21=0.126w1+0.370w2+0.144w3+0.187w4+0.103w5+0.565w6}min{Z22=0.182w1+0.060w2+0.095w3+0.415w4+0.066w5+0.446w6}min{Z23=0.085w1+0.590w2+0.328w3+0.091w4+0.051w5+0.144w6}min{Z24=0.188w1+0.330w2+0.401w3+0.452w4+0.116w5+0.563w6}s.t.w∈ΩBy using Eq. (54), we obtain the maximum and minimum values corresponding to each objective as follows:Z11max=0.532,Z12max=0.548,Z13max=0.536,Z14max=0.335,Z21max=0.269,Z22max=0.300,Z23max=0.274,Z24max=0.374,Z11min=0.459,Z12min=0.375,Z13min=0.495,Z14min=0.239,Z21min=0.187,Z22min=0.171,Z23min=0.157,Z24min=0.270. Based on these ideal values, we construct some membership functions corresponding to the objectives by Eqs. (48) and (49). Combined with these membership functions, Eq. (54) can be transformed into its equivalent linear programming model through Eq. (50):(55)min=λ11((0.671w1+0.582w2+0.457w3+0.508w4+0.423w5+0.211w6)−0.459)/0.073+λ12((0.455w1+0.700w2+0.695w3+0.254w4+0.643w5+0.128w6)−0.375)/0.174+λ13((0.576w1+0.400w2+0.533w3+0.540w4+0.585w5+0.406w6)−0.495)/0.041+λ14((0.188w1+0.596w2+0.311w3+0.147w4+0.569w5+0.111w6)−0.261)/0.099+λ21(0.264−(0.126w1+0.370w2+0.144w3+0.187w4+0.103w5+0.565w6))/0.080+λ22(0.300−(0.182w1+0.060w2+0.095w3+0.415w4+0.066w5+0.446w6))/0.126+λ23(0.291−(0.085w1+0.590w2+0.328w3+0.091w4+0.051w5+0.144w6))/0.129+λ24(0.400−(0.188w1+0.330w2+0.401w3+0.452w4+0.116w5+0.563w6))/0.105s.t.w∈ΩStep 5. By using Lingo 11.0 to solve Eq. (55), we can get the weight vector of attributew=(0.31,0.19,0.08,0.21,0.16,0.05)forλtk=18(t=1, 2;k=1, 2, 3, 4).Step 6. Use Eq. (2) to calculate the collective overall rating of each provider Sk(k∈P), which is shown in Table 7.Step 7. According to the method presented in Section 2.2, the ranking orders and the best providers for different admissible orders are also shown in Table 7.Remark 6For all the admissible orders, we obtain different winning providers, such as S1, S2 and S3. Therefore, we need to calculate the Shapley values related to providers S1, S2 and S3. Using the algorithms proposed by Bustince et al. [55], we have the corresponding Shapley values as φ(S1)=0.2346, φ(S2)=0.2295 and φ(S3)=0.2436, respectively, then φ(S3)>φ(S1)>φ(S2) and hence S3≻S1≻S2≻S4 where the notation “≻” indicates one provider is preferred to another. Therefore, the best provider is S3.Hwang and Yoon [56] firstly proposed the TOPSIS method which is one of easily usable and explainable method for solving decision problems. The basic idea of the TOPSIS is that the chosen alternative should have the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS) and the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS). Many extended TOPSIS methods [13,14] have been used to solve the heterogeneous MAGDM problems. In order to compare easily, we extend the TOPSIS method [56] to dispose appropriately the CCS provider selection example. The extended TOPSIS method can be summarized in the following procedure.Step 1 and Step 2. Refer to Steps 1and 2 in Section 4.2.Step 3. Aggregate the ratings of DMs into the collective rating of each alternative on each attribute using the equation:(56)x˜′jk=∑i=1mxijkmifj∈N1∑i=1mx_ijkm,∑i=1mx¯ijkmifj∈N2∑i=1maijkm,∑i=1mbijkm,∑i=1mcijkmifj∈N3∑i=1maijkm,∑i=1mbijkm,∑i=1mcijkm,∑i=1mdijkmifj∈N4∑i=1mμijkm,∑i=1mvijkmifj∈N6.Step 4. Form the heterogeneous decision matrix. By Eq. (56), the heterogeneous MAGDM problem can be converted into a heterogeneous decision matrixM=(rkj)m×n.Step 5. Determine the NISxj−=Ajminand PISxj+=Ajmax.Step 6. Calculate the relative closeness of the alternative Skas follow(57)RCk=∑j=1nwjDkj−Dkj++Dkj−,whereDkj−=dj(rkj,xj−)andDkj+=dj(rkj,xj+)denote the distances between the jth attribute value of alternative Skto the NIS and PIS respectively.Step 7. Rank the alternatives according to the RCkof the alternative Sk.In the following, we employ the extended TOPSIS method to solve the same example in Section 5.1.By Steps 3 and 4, the collective rating of each alternative on each attribute and the decision matrix are calculated and shown in Table 8.By Step 5, the PIS and the NIS are also shown in Table 8.By Step 6, taking three different attribute weight vectorsw=(0.050,0.100,0.350,0.350,0.100,0.050),w=(0.100,0.050,0.050,0.050,0.700,0.050)andw=(0.200,0.109,0.1507,0.1403,0.100,0.300), we can obtain the corresponding relative closeness and ranking of alternatives, which are shown in Table 9.From Table 9, the ranking orders of the alternatives are remarkably diverse for different weight vectors. Ifw=(0.050,0.100,0.350,0.350,0.100,0.050), the ranking order is S2≻S3≻S1≻S4 and the best provider is S2. Ifw=(0.100,0.050,0.050,0.050,0.700,0.050), the ranking order is S4≻S2≻S3≻S1 and the best provider is S4. In other words, the ranking order is unsteady since the weights are determined subjectively. If the weight vector is taken asw=(0.200,0.109,0.1507,0.1403,0.100,0.300), we have RC1=0.557, RC2=0.564, RC3=0.564 and RC4=0.490. Hence, the ranking order is S3≻S2≻S1≻S4 and the best provider is S2 or S3. Namely, the extended TOPSIS method cannot distinguish which is the best one. Therefore, our proposed method is more reliable.In comparison with the extended TOPSIS method, the proposed method has the following desirable advantages:(1)The latter utilizes the multi-objective AIF programming model to determine the attribute weights, which is more objective and reasonable, whereas the former needs the DM to provide the attribute weights in advance, which is inevitably subjective.The latter puts forward a new method to aggregate the heterogeneous information into AIFNs. As such, the collective decision matrix aggregated by the latter is an AIF decision matrix containing AIFNs only, which is easy to dispose. However, the collective decision matrix aggregated by the former is still a decision matrix with heterogeneous information, which is relatively hard to handle.The collective overall rating of each alternative in the latter is described by an AIFN, which is well-suited to express the hesitancy degree inherent in DMs’ judgments, while the collective overall rating in the former is a relative closeness which is a crisp value and cannot reflect the hesitancy degree inherent in DMs’ judgments.In this section, compared with Yue et al.’s methods [44–47], the key features of the proposed method are listed as follows:(1)This paper first puts forward a new general method for aggregating heterogeneous decision information into AIFNs. It can aggregate real numbers, intervals, TFNs, TrFNs and linguistic variables into AIFNs, whereas the existing methods [44–47] can only aggregate real numbers into AIFN. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problems described in Section 6.1 while the methods [44–47] are only suitable to solve MAGDM problem in which the decision data are described by real numbers.The proposed general aggregating method can not only effectively reduce information loss, but also avoid the unreasonable computation results occurred in method [47]. Meanwhile, it generalizes the aggregation technique of method [47].To determine the weights of the attributes objectively, a new multiple objective AIF programming model is established and transformed into linear program to solve. It can remedy the drawback of subjective randomness of giving the attribute weights a priori in methods [44–47].To further illustrate the superiority of the proposed method, the decision method developed by Barrenechea et al. [57] is applied to get the final solution alternative for the comprehensive assessments of the alternatives in Table 7. Firstly, following the Algorithm proposed by Bustince et al. [55], the corresponding reciprocal fuzzy preference relation is obtained asR=−0.5050.4780.7190.495−0.4750.6930.5220.525−0.7260.2800.3070.274−.Then, by the method of Section 7 in [57], the interval-valued fuzzy preference relation of R is computed asR˜=−[0.005,0.995][0.021,0.977][0.315,0.877][0.005,0.995]−[0.024,0.974][0.267,0.881][0.023,0.979][0.026,0.976]−[0.328,0.876][0.123,0.683][0.119,0.733][0.124,0.672]−.Thirdly, utilizing respectively the four methods proposed in [57], the aggregated intervals of each row ofR˜are calculated for the three admissible orders between intervals:≺_L1,≺_L2,≺_XY. The computation results and the ranking orders of alternatives are listed in Tables 10 and 11.Finally, it is easily seen from Table 11 that in the above twelve ranking orders there are five ranking orders regarding S3 as the best provider, three ranking orders regarding S2 as the best provider. According the first rule of the consensus algorithm 4 in [57], the best provider is S3, which is in accordance with that obtained by the proposed method in this paper (see Section 6.1). The experimental result shows that the proposed method is reliable.In what follows, we compare the method [57] with the proposed method in this paper.(1)The focuses of both methods are considerably different. The former is to build interval-valued fuzzy preference relations from given fuzzy preference relations and weak ignorance functions and apply it to decision problems with a single DM, whereas the latter focuses on general aggregating method to heterogeneous MAGDM problems with incomplete weight information. In the former, the degrees of preference of alternatives are represented by real numbers, whereas the attribute values of alternatives in the latter are expressed by multiple different types of data including real numbers, interval numbers, AIFNs, TFNs and TrFNs.The idea of computing Qhd in the latter is a little similar to that of deriving ignorance degree in the former. However, the ignorance situation in the latter is reflected by assigning membership values close to 0.5, the Qhd in the latter is obtained by computing relative closeness degree to the middle grade. Furthermore, the latter can deal with multiple types of data.Considering that (1) the comprehensive values of the alternatives in the latter are obtained by four aggregation operators, whereas those in the latter are obtained by only one operator; and (2) the former may generate twelve ranking results of alternatives, whereas the latter has only three ranking results of alternatives, therefore, the latter is simpler than the former.When the decision data are expressed by linguistic values, the latter can also be used to solve MAGDM with linguistic values. In other words, the latter can solve not only heterogeneous MAGDM but also MAGDM with linguistic values. The former did not take into account multiple different decision data. So, the latter has a wider application range than the former.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we put forward a new method for aggregating the heterogeneous information into AIFNs and applied to heterogeneous MAGDM. What is significant in this paper are summarized as follows:(1)A new general method for aggregating heterogeneous information into AIFNs is developed. This method can aggregate different types of information (including real numbers, interval numbers, TFNs and TrFNs) into AIFNs and generalizes existing similar methods.The attribute weights are determined objectively by constructing a multiple objective AIF programming which is transformed into a linear programming model to solve.Combining the proposed aggregating heterogeneous information method with the obtained attribute weights, a new method is presented to solve heterogeneous MAGDM problems.Although the proposed method is developed for solving heterogeneous MAGDM problems, it is also appropriate for the complex multi-attribute large-group decision-making problems. Future research will extend the developed method to uniform heterogeneous information into interval-valued Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and apply to MAGDM.
