@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The metabolic rearrangements occurring in cancer cells can be effectively investigated with a Systems Biology approach supported by metabolic network modeling. We here present tissue-specific constraint-based core models for three different types of tumors (liver, breast and lung) that serve this purpose. The core models were extracted and manually curated from the corresponding genome-scale metabolic models in the Human Metabolic Atlas database with a focus on the pathways that are known to play a key role in cancer growth and proliferation. Along similar lines, we also reconstructed a core model from the original general human metabolic network to be used as a reference model.A comparative Flux Balance Analysis between the reference and the cancer models highlighted both a clear distinction between the two conditions and a heterogeneity within the three different cancer types in terms of metabolic flux distribution. These results emphasize the need for modeling approaches able to keep up with this tumoral heterogeneity in order to identify more suitable drug targets and develop effective treatments. According to this perspective, we identified key points able to reverse the tumoral phenotype toward the reference one or vice-versa.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the past decades, a large quantity of information has been gathered about the main metabolic differences between cancerous cells and their healthy counterparts (Hornberg et al., 2006). Fundamental differences in the metabolism of normal cells and rapidly proliferating cancer cells were already observed in 1924, when Otto Warburg detected a reprogramming of glucose metabolism in tumor cells also known as “Warburg effect” (Vander Heiden et al., 2009; Locasale and Cantley, 2010). According to this phenomenon, cancer cells metabolize large quantities of glucose into lactate by a fermentative metabolism regardless of oxygen availability, as opposed to normal cells, which mainly rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy required for cellular processes. More recently, it has been suggested that a global cancer metabolic rewiring is performed in order to more effectively support the neoplastic proliferation replacing the metabolic program that operates in normal cells, which involves also a stimulated utilization of glutamine by reductive carboxylation (Metallo et al., 2012) and an alteration of redox processes (Alberghina and Gaglio, 2014).Given the complexity and nonlinearity of metabolism, a focus narrowed on the single molecules or mechanisms responsible for carcinogenesis fails to capture the complexity of cancer metabolic rewiring. Attention on the complex network of interactions in which they are involved, typical of Systems Biology (Alberghina and Westerhoff, 2005; Kitano, 2000, 2001, 2002), is therefore required for the purpose. In this regard, mathematical models, which are formal and simplified representation of real systems, help to handle this complexity, maintaining at the same time a high level of accuracy and detail (Stelling, 2004).In particular, in the context of metabolic networks, genome-scale modeling represents an increasingly used approach (Cazzaniga et al., 2014), as it has been shown to be successful in modeling the entire human metabolism (Duarte et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2007; Hao et al., 2010; Thiele et al., 2013), as well as cancer cells metabolism for the prediction of selective drug targets (Folger et al., 2011; Agren et al., 2012, 2014; Gatto et al., 2014). In spite of the potentialities linked to their comprehensiveness, these reconstructions are difficult to control and often include errors, such as improper filling of network gaps (i.e. missing metabolic reactions that prevent the production or consumption of one or more metabolites). Moreover, the interpretation of the outcomes of their simulation is not always straightforward due to the difficulty in rationalizing such amount of data. On the other hand, core models, which limit the scope to specific aspects of metabolism, require more assumptions and a higher level of abstraction; nevertheless, they can be more accurately curated, their underlying assumptions are explicit, they are simpler, and thus their analysis might be more effective in uncovering system-level properties of cancer metabolic rewiring.In view of this, starting from already existing genome-scale metabolic models, we aim at reconstructing manually curated core models that zoom-in on cancer metabolic rewiring. In order to study the role of the Warburg effect and more in general the role of all cancer metabolic alterations in supporting the neoplastic proliferation, we did not model a generic cancer cell, but rather we focused on the three most harmful neoplasias, in terms of incidence, mortality and prevalence, according to the last estimations in GLOBOCAN (Ferlay et al., 2013; Bray et al., 2013): liver, breast and lung tumors.In fact, even though some metabolic features are associated with most cancer cells, several variations may emerge in specific tumor types (Gatto et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2013). Cancer specific models may therefore be useful in identifying specific drug targets, paving the way toward a more personalized medicine.Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) (Fell and Small, 1986; Varma and Palsson, 1993a,b; Orth et al., 2010) is a constraint-based method that allows to quickly calculate the flux of metabolites (i.e., the rate at which every metabolite is consumed or produced by each reaction) through all the reactions of a metabolic network, without requiring any information about kinetic parameters or metabolite concentrations.FBA assumes that the time variation of internal metabolite concentrations is equal to zero (pseudo-steady state assumption) and proceeds with an iterative application of constraints (reaction thermodynamics and capacity constraints) on the evaluated system (Orth et al., 2010) in order to exclude flux distributions from the space of allowable ones (Raman and Chandra, 2009).Assuming than that the cell behavior is optimal with respect to a certain objective, FBA exploits linear programming to identify an optimal flux distribution within the defined solution space according to an objective function (as e.g. production of biomass or ATP yield) (Orth et al., 2010).To investigate the metabolic processes of specific human cancer types, we exploited the Human Metabolic Atlas (HMA), a database which contains genome-scale metabolic networks for 69 cell types and 16 cancer types in addition to a generic and aspecific human metabolic model: the Human Metabolic Reaction (HMR) database, which has been constructed by merging elements of previously published generic genome-scale human metabolic models (Recon 1 (Duarte et al., 2007), EHMN (Ma et al., 2007)) and by incorporating information from different databases such as HumanCyc (Romero et al., 2004) and KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2014).The specific models represent portions of the generic HMR that are expressed (or “active”) in each tissue or cell type, according to biological evidence. In particular, cell type specific proteomic data contained in the Human Proteome Atlas (HPA) database (Uhlén et al., 2005) and tissue specific gene expression data and metabolomic data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (Wishart et al., 2007, 2009, 2012) were integrated by applying the INIT (Integrative Network Inference for Tissues) algorithm (Agren et al., 2012). Based on these different kinds of “omics” data, INIT assigns weights to the reactions in the HMR according to their different levels of evidence in the specific tissue or cell type. An optimization process is then performed with the aim of maximizing as much as possible the reactions fluxes with a high weight (since the corresponding enzymes have a high expression level) while minimizing the others. Reactions that carry flux in the obtained optimal flux distribution are assigned to the tissue or cell specific model.Starting with the genome-scale networks, we manually reconstructed constraint-based core metabolic models for the three different types of cancers and for a generic aspecific reference cell, by extracting those metabolic pathways having a relevant role in supporting cancer cells growth and proliferation (Alberghina and Gaglio, 2014; Resendis-Antonio et al., 2010).The reconstruction process of these models was not limited to the selection of the reactions of interest, but also involved the integration of all the elements required to perform FBA, such as transport and exchange reactions.The former are essential to allow metabolites transport between compartments, while the latter define the environmental constraints and may be subdivided into sinks (defining the cell nutrients) and demands (defining compounds secreted by the cell). Exchange reactions were also used to represent non-modeled metabolites pertaining to pathways not included here.As a final step, we performed an accurate manual curation of the developed core models in order to check the presence of incorrect reactions, as well as network gaps. This curation phase strongly relied on the biological database KEGG and on the most up-to-date human metabolic reconstruction Recon 2 (Thiele et al., 2013).A topological analysis has been performed on the reconstructed core models with the aim of examining their structural properties, by using the software Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2007), and more precisely its plugin NetworkAnalyzer. In order to characterize the topology of the metabolic networks, we calculated the node degree distribution and the clustering coefficient for every metabolic network. We refer the reader to the review in Barabási and Oltvai (2004) for an exhaustive description of the above mentioned metrics.Following the reconstruction of the core metabolic models, we estimated the optimal flux distribution for each of them with FBA. In order to compare the capabilities of cancer cells with respect to normal cells to cope with the same metabolic requirements, given an identical medium composition, we did not impose specific flux values for nutrient uptakes, but we imposed the same arbitrary value (1000), while we left the flux in the allowed direction unbounded for all internal reactions. For the same reason, although specific biomass formation pseudo-reactions representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass are provided in the original genome-wide models, we used the same formulation as objective function for both types of cells.The simulations have been performed using the COBRA (COnstraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis) Toolbox (Becker et al., 2007; Schellenberger et al., 2011) and the GLPK linear programming solver. Each obtained flux distribution has been evaluated to check the absence of possible thermodynamically infeasible loops by using the algorithm developed in De Martino et al. (2013).Once that flux distributions free from thermodynamical infeasible loops were obtained, we compared each cancer model with respect to the reference model, computing the fold change for each reaction as the ratio of the corresponding flux value in the cancer model versus its flux value in the reference one. It is worth stressing that the choice of using the same reference model, rather than comparing each tumor against its corresponding healthy model, is essential in order to make the three cancer models comparable among themselves and making the differential analysis meaningful.We carried out two different analyses on the reconstructed core models. The aim of the first one is to highlight the reactions responsible for a reversion of the tumoral phenotype toward the reference model, whereas the second one has as purpose the identification of all the possible fragility points in the cancer models, which are able to cause, if inhibited, a negative effect on the system.Identification of reactions responsible for the phenotype reversion. This analysis aims to identify the structural differences in the core metabolic networks that are mainly responsible for their dissimilarities in terms of flux distributions.In attempting to reach this goal, it is necessary to identify the reactions that are differentially present in the four core models.We determined the set of reactions that are present only in the reference model and we added them in a stepwise fashion to the cancer models in order to investigate the effect of each perturbation. We also identified the reactions shared by all tumor models, but not present in the reference one. Such reactions were included in the reference model to evaluate whether a flux distribution typical of cancer cell could be obtained. Along similar lines, we removed these reactions from the tumor models to assess if their removal caused a reversion of the tumoral phenotype toward the reference one.Identification of cancer networks fragility points. In order to identify fragility points in the reconstructed cancer models, we examined the “extent” of the Warburg effect in each of them through the quantification of two indexes, as proposed in Yizhak et al. (2014):•the glycolytic to oxidative ATP flux ratio (AFR)the ratio of the glycolytic versus oxidative capacity (EOR), computed as the fraction of extracellular acidification rate (i.e. lactate secretion flux value), over the oxygen consumption rate (i.e. oxygen consumption flux value).Given that high AFR and EOR ratios denote tumors with a “high” Warburg level (as explained in Barabási and Oltvai, 2004), we queried those reactions that, if inhibited, reduce the Warburg effect, by decreasing the AFR and EOR ratios. The simulation of each metabolic reaction inhibition (and then, of the corresponding enzyme) has been performed by constraining the flux through each reaction to zero.We also searched for those reactions that, after inhibition of the corresponding enzyme, lead to a reduction of the biomass synthesis rate. It has indeed been suggested that the above mentioned indexes are positively associated to cancer cell migration, but may have no effect on cell proliferation (Yizhak et al., 2014), in which we are interested.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work, we pointed out the potentiality of the mathematical modeling of complex biological systems in relation to the understanding of cancer metabolic rewiring. In order to identify and study the role of all metabolic alterations supporting the neoplastic proliferation, we performed a comparative analysis between a reference and a cancer condition starting from the automatically generated genome-scale networks of the Human Metabolic Atlas database concerning a generic reference cell and three different types of tumor. In the context of cancer cells metabolism, genome-scale modeling represents an increasingly used approach. However, these networks are often not adequately curated and include errors, such as metabolic gaps, that imply the need to perform a further manual curation phase (as occurred in our work). Starting from the chosen genome-scale models, we manually reconstructed core constraint-based metabolic models that zoom-in on cancer metabolic rewiring, considering only specific aspects of metabolism. Unlike genome-scale models, core models are much less difficult to control and their curation may be more accurate.A constraint-based approach, the Flux Balance Analysis, allowed to identify several metabolic alterations in cancer cells models, which may represent potential targets for the development of therapies able to counteract cancer cells growth and proliferation. Indeed, following the flux distributions analysis in the four core models, we observed a clear distinction between reference and cancer condition under several aspects: growth rate, emergence of the Warburg effect, lactate secretion, glucose and glutamine uptake, TCA cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation flux values. Two further analyses on the reconstructed core models allowed to detect other potential drug targets, both analyzing the structural differences in core metabolic networks that are responsible for a reversion of the tumoral phenotype toward the reference one, and identifying all the fragility points within the cancer models corresponding to reactions that, if perturbed, cause a negative effect on the system.The constraint-based models also highlighted a heterogeneity in terms of flux values not only between reference and cancer conditions, but also among the three different cancers, concerning the pathways shown in Figs. 3–5, which are glycolysis, TCA cycle and OXPHOS. This result strengthens the need to focus the attention on several types of tumors rather than on a generic cancer cell, because, although some metabolic features are associated to the three cancers, relevant variations emerged among them. These ones are of great interest in the medical field for the identification of cancer type - specific drug targets in order to develop more effective treatments. The emerged heterogeneity highlights how, given a specific phenotype of interest (cancer, in our case), three different sub-phenotypes may be identified.On the other hand, the analysis has revealed that some caution is required when dealing with tissue-specific models that have been automatically reconstructed from -omics data. It may indeed happen that, when looking for the optimal “active network”, which include the least number of reactions catalyzed by proteins having a low expression level and the greatest number of reactions catalyzed by proteins having a high expression level, some reactions will be removed from the network, even if they are not necessarily inactive in the corresponding tissue (as it is the case for the reaction 3-phospho-d-glycerate→2-phospho-d-glycerate and for inorganic phosphate and water transport reactions mentioned, respectively, in Sections 3.1 and 3.3).In this regard, an approach that is complementary to the reconstruction of distinct tissue-specific networks – and that may represent a possible future development of this work – is the ensemble-evolutionary FBA (eeFBA) approach introduced in Damiani et al. (2014), which allows to identify ensemble of possible flux distributions of a generic metabolic network that are compatible with different cancer phenotypes.At last, since we have made the three cancer models comparable among themselves using a common reference model, and in order to identify specific peculiarity linked to a certain type of tissue that is not highlighted using the reference model, a further extension of our work will be the comparison between each of our three cancer core models and their corresponding healthy tissue-specific models recently published within the Human Metabolic Atlas database (Uhlén et al., 2015).
