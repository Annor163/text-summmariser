Facies analysis, glauconite distribution and sequence stratigraphy of the middle Eocene Qarara Formation, El-Minya area, Egypt

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The studied rocks comprise two principal facies: lower argillaceous and upper carbonate.The recorded microfacies were deposited in shallow open marine environment.The argillaceous facies represents highstand systems tract.The carbonate facies represents transgressive systems tract.Two fourth-fifth order sequences were recognized in the Qarara Formation.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Qarara Formation consists mainly of shale at the base and overlain by limestone at the top. The formation is Middle Eocene (Lutetian) in age. Three sections located at the eastern bank of the Nile River in El-Minya Province have been measured, described, and sampled. These sections from north to south are: Gebel Qarara, El-Sheikh Fadl, and Gebel El-Ahmar.The main microfacies identified in the studied sections are: silty claystone, silty shale, fossiliferous glauconite, glauconitic (green) sand, glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone, glauconitic bioclastic wacke-packstone, glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstone-wackestone. These microfacies have been deposited in shallow open marine environment.Collectively the studied rocks contain two principal facies: lower argillaceous facies and upper carbonate facies that separated by glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone bed. The lower argillaceous part represents highstand systems tract (HST), whereas the upper carbonate part represents transgressive systems tract (TST). The glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone bed is recognized as a sequence boundary (SB).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The study area includes five mappable Eocene rock units: the Beni Suef Formation, the Samalut Formation, the Maghagha Formation, the Qarara Formation, and the El Fashn Formation. These five formations are Middle Eocene in age [1–3].The Eocene succession exposed in the east bank of the Nile River between Maghagha and El-Fashn is similar in gross lithologic characters to the succession developed in the area south of Fayum [4]. In the Fayum area, the formational names Maghagha, Qarara, and El-Fashn are replaced by the Muweilih, Midawara, Sath el Hadid, and Gharaq formations by Iskander [5].The present studied rock units belong to the Qarara Formation which was described by Bishay [3] and Omara et al. [6] on the basis of its Nummulites sp. content. The Qarara Formation is Late Lutetian in age by Cronin and Khalifa [7] due to the presence of smaller and larger foraminifera. The present study focuses on facies development, distribution of glauconite, and sequence architecture of the Middle Eocene Qarara Formation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The Middle Eocene Qarara Formation consists of seven microfacies arranged from base to top as follows; silty claystone, silty shale, fossiliferous glauconite, glauconitic (green) sand, glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone, glauconitic bioclastic wacke-packstone, glauconitic bioclastic lime-mudstone-wackestone.Shale and claystone of the studied Qarara Formation deposited in quiet water settings. The presence of glauconite represents a condensed setting in an overall calm environment. The carbonate microfacies are deposited in inner ramp setting because of presence of the larger foraminifera and bivalve fragments.The studied rocks comprise two principal facies, lower argillaceous facies and upper carbonate one. They are separated by glauconitic fossiliferous ironstone bed. Two fourth-fifth order sequences were recognized in the studied sections. These sequences range in thickness from 3 to 18 m.
