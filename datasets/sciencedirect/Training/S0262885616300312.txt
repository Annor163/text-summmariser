@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Image classification is to assign a category of an image and image annotation is to describe individual components of an image by using some annotation terms. These two learning tasks are strongly related. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new discriminative and sparse topic model (DSTM) for image classification and annotation by combining visual, annotation and label information from a set of training images. The essential features of DSTM different from existing approaches are that (i) the label information is enforced in the generation of both visual words and annotation terms such that each generative latent topic corresponds to a category; (ii) the zero-mean Laplace distribution is employed to give a sparse representation of images in visual words and annotation terms such that relevant words and terms are associated with latent topics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides the discrimination ability in classification and annotation, and its performance is better than the other testing methods (sLDA-ann, abc-corr-LDA, SupDocNADE, SAGE and MedSTC) for LabelMe, UIUC, NUS-WIDE and PascalVOC07 images.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image classification and annotation are important problems in computer vision. Image classification is to assign a category of an image, and the purpose is to describe an image globally. Traditional supervised learning methods are widely used for image classification, including support vector machine [9,33], random forest [7,26], and probabilistic graphic model [6,14,23,34,29]. Image annotation is to describe individual components of an image by using some annotation terms. Matrix factorization [36], multi-label learning [39,34] and generative techniques [2,4,15,16,28] have been developed.Image classification and image annotation are strongly related. For examples, an image labeled as a coast scene is likely to be annotated with “boat” and “beach”, but is unlikely to be annotated with “door” and “window”. An image annotated with “door” and “window” is likely to be labeled as a street scene, but is unlikely to be labeled as a coast scene. Label information can be used to enhance the performance of image annotation, and annotation information can be employed to increase classification accuracy. Therefore, it would be an interesting and challenging research problem how to combine both label and annotation information to design efficient and effective methods for image classification and annotation simultaneously.Recently, graph model [8,11], neural network model [38], supervised non-negative matrix factorization model [21], regression model [19], and generative graphical model [32,24] are adopted here. Among them, the graph model and the neural network model have higher complexities for the process of building graph or network. The ideas of other models are to identify latent topical bases and represent images in the topical space for later image classification and annotation. However, the learned topics are not discriminative enough to identify the image category because they are related to all visual and annotation terms. An ideal situation is that each topic has its own relevant visual words and annotation terms as shown in Fig. 1.In this paper, we propose a discriminative and sparse topic model (DSTM) to generate latent topics such that relevant visual words and annotation terms can be identified and irrelevant words and terms can be ignored. The essential features of DSTM include:(i)The label information is enforced in the generation of visual words and annotation terms, which guarantees that each latent topic consists of visual words or annotation terms which closely corresponding to a category, i.e., the learned topics are more discriminative.The zero-mean Laplace distribution is added to a topic generative process, which makes each topic contain a few visual words and annotation terms, and then an image can be represented sparsely by the latent topics.The sparse image representation in the identified topic space is helpful to learn a training model and then to improve classification and annotation performance. A series of experiments on LabelMe, UIUC, NUS-WIDE and PascalVOC07 images are conducted to demonstrate the performance of DSTM is better than the other testing methods (sLDA-ann, abc-corr-LDA, SupDocNADE, SAGE and MedSTC).The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe related work. In Section 3, we introduce DSTM model and its parameter estimation algorithm. In Section 4, experimental results are presented to show the DSTM is effective. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
