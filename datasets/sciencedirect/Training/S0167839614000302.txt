@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Upper bounds on derivatives of parametric curves and surfaces have many important applications in computer graphics and geometric modeling. For example, many algorithms for parametric curves and surfaces, such as surface display, singularity point detection of curve, and curve/curve and surface/surface intersection, depend on knowing the upper bounds on derivatives (Filip et al., 1986; Sederberg and Meyers, 1988; Floater, 1992). And a tight upper bound on the derivative will be helpful in improving the efficiency of these algorithms.In general, the commonly used parametric curves/surfaces can be divided into two types: polynomial and rational. The rational parametric curves and surfaces are more flexible modeling tools than the polynomial ones. The derivative of a parametric polynomial curve/surface can be simply represented as the same type of curve/surface with a lower degree. On the other hand, formulae of derivatives of rational curves and surfaces are more complicated, as the derivatives are of higher order than the originals. Hence, a priori determination of a tight bound on their derivative magnitude is nontrivial.So far, many literatures have focused on estimating or improving the bounds on the derivatives of rational curves or surfaces (Floater, 1992; Saito et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1997; Hermann, 1999; Zheng and Sederberg, 2000; Selimovic, 2005; Cao et al., 2007; Hu and Wang, 2007; Zhang and Wang, 2005; Huang and Su, 2006; Zhang and Ma, 2006; Deng, 2011; Deng and Li, 2013; Li et al., 2013). We notice that most of these papers have focused on the bounds estimation of the derivatives of Bézier curves or tensor product Bézier surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, little of the published literature has studied the bound estimation of triangular Bézier surfaces. The earliest reference to estimating bounds of first- and second-order partial derivatives of a rational triangular Bézier surface was a paper by Zhang and Wang (2005). Later, Hu and Wang (2007) and Cao et al. (2007) independently obtained new bounds based on the same idea of degree elevation.As a matter of fact, triangular Bézier surfaces defined by barycentric coordinates are a mathematically more natural generalization of Bézier curves than tensor-product Bézier surfaces. They are a topologically more flexible modeling tool than tensor products. Hence, they are considered to be more suitable for representing models with complex geometries and fitting or interpolating scattered data points. The wide use of triangular Bézier surfaces in practice necessitates a tight bound for their derivatives.This paper deduces new upper bounds of magnitudes of (first- and second-order) partial derivatives of the rational triangular Bézier surfaces based on degree elevation property, convex hull property, and some basic algebra skills. We theoretically and numerically illustrate that the new bounds are much tighter than the existing ones.This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly revisit the definition and properties of the triangular Bézier surfaces, together with some preliminary results that will be needed later. Section 3 deduces new bounds on the first- and second-order partial derivatives of triangular Bézier surfaces. The existing bounds are compared theoretically with the new proposed bounds in Section 4. This paper concludes by presenting some numerical examples to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed bounds.Before deducing the main results of this paper, we need to introduce some definitions and notations in this section.Given a non-degenerate triangular parametric domain T, a traditional (with positive weights) rational triangular Bézier surface of degree n is given by Farin (2002)(1)R(u)=∑|i|=nRiωiBin(u)∑|i|=nωiBin(u):=N(u)D(u),whereu=(u,v,w)(with0≤u,v,w≤1andu+v+w=1) are the barycentric coordinates with respect to T,i=(i,j,k)and|i|=nmeansi+j+k=n,Ri=Ri,j,k∈R3are the control points,Bin(u)=n!i!j!k!uivjwkandωi=ωi,j,k>0are the Bernstein basis functions and the weights, respectively. In the remainder of this paper, a basisBin(u)will be denoted byBinfor ease of notation.To facilitate the subsequent discussion, here we introduce some notations and operators, most of which are borrowed from Hu and Wang (2007). Lete1=(1,0,0),e2=(0,1,0),e3=(0,0,1)andi=(i,j,k)(with|i|=n−1) be ordered triples, theni+e1,i+e2,i+e3represent(i+1,j,k),(i,j+1,k),(i,j,k+1), respectively. We denote the operators as follows:Δ1ωi=ωi+e1−ωi+e3,Δ2ωi=ωi+e2−ωi+e3,Δ1ωiRi=ωi+e1Ri+e1−ωi+e3Ri+e3,Δ2ωiRi=ωi+e2Ri+e2−ωi+e3Ri+e3.For an ordered triplep=(p,q,r)with|p|=n, we denoteDi,p=ωi+e1(Ri+e1−Rp)−ωi+e3(Ri+e3−Rp).The following lemmas, which have been derived in mentioned references, will be used repeatedly for the proof of our results.Lemma 1The property of degree elevationA Bézier surface of degreen−1can be expressed as a Bézier surface of degree n (Farin, 2002) as followsR(u)=∑|i|=n−1RiBin−1=∑|i|=nR¯iBin,whereR¯i=inRi−e1+jnRi−e2+knRi−e3.The first-order partial derivatives ofBinare given byHu and Wang (2007)∂Bin∂u=n(Bi−e1n−1−Bi−e3n−1),∂Bin∂v=n(Bi−e2n−1−Bi−e3n−1).Lemma 3Given two positive numbers a and b, and two vectors P and Q, we have (Hu and Wang, 2007)‖aP−bQ‖≤max{a,b}×max{‖P‖,‖Q‖,‖P−Q‖}.Given positive numbersaiand vectorsPiwithi=1,...,4, we have (Hu and Wang, 2007)‖a1P1+a2P2−a3P3−a4P4‖≤2max1≤i≤4{ai}×max{{‖Pi‖}i=14,‖P1−P3‖,‖P2−P4‖}.For real numbersai≥0,bi>0,i=0,…,n, we have (Deng and Li, 2013)∑i=0nai∑i=0nbi≤max0≤i≤n{aibi}.In this section, we derive the bounds on the first- and second-order partial derivatives of rational triangular Bézier surfaces.Theorem 1For a triangular Bézier surface of degree n defined by(1), a bound on the magnitude of the first-order partial derivative with respect to u can be expressed as(2)‖Ru(u)‖≤max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖,where(3)Qi,p=12[iωi+e3−e1ωi(Rp−Ri+e3−e1)+jωi+e3−e2ωi(Rp−Ri+e3−e2)+jωi+e1−e2ωi(Ri+e1−e2−Rp)+kωi+e1−e3ωi(Ri+e1−e3−Rp)+pωp+e3−e1ωp(Ri−Rp+e3−e1)+qωp+e3−e2ωp(Ri−Rp+e3−e2)+qωp+e1−e2ωp(Rp+e1−e2−Ri)+rωp+e1−e3ωp(Rp+e1−e3−Ri)+(i+r−k−p)(Ri−Rp)],withp=(p,q,r),|p|=n.By Lemma 2, the first-order partial derivative of a rational Bézier surface (1) with respect to u can be written as(4)Ru(u)=Nu(u)D(u)−Du(u)N(u)D2(u):=F(u)D2(u),whereN(u)andD(u)appear in Eq. (1) and(5)Du(u)=n∑|i|=n−1Bin−1Δ1ωi,(6)Nu(u)=n∑|i|=n−1Bin−1Δ1ωiRi.Following degree elevation, we have(7)F(u)=Nu(u)D(u)−Du(u)N(u)=n∑|i|=n−1∑|p|=nωpBpnBin−1Di,p=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nωpBpnBin(iDi−e1,p+jDi−e2,p+kDi−e3,p).By swapping the order of summation and regrouping, we have(8)F(u)=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nωiBpnBin(pDp−e1,i+qDp−e2,i+rDp−e3,i).Adding Eq. (7) and Eq. (8), we haveF(u)=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nωiωpBpnBinQi,p,whereQi,pis defined by Eq. (3). AsD2(u)can be expressed as(9)D2(u)=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nωiωpBinBpn,we complete the proof by applying Lemma 5.  □The first-order partial derivative of surface (1) with respect to v can be obtained in a similar fashion as(10)‖Rv(u)‖≤max|i|=|p|=n‖Pi,p‖,where(11)Pi,p=12[iωi+e2−e1ωi(Ri+e2−e1−Rp)+iωi+e3−e1ωi(Rp−Ri+e3−e1)+jωi+e3−e2ωi(Rp−Ri+e3−e2)+kωi+e2−e3ωi(Ri+e2−e3−Rp)+pωp+e2−e1ωp(Rp+e2−e1−Ri)+pωp+e3−e1ωp(Ri−Rp+e3−e1)+qωp+e3−e2ωp(Ri−Rp+e3−e2)+rωp+e2−e3ωp(Rp+e2−e3−Ri)+(j+r−k−q)(Ri−Rp)],withp=(p,q,r),|p|=n.Theorem 2For a triangular Bézier surface of degree n defined by(1), a bound on the magnitude of the second-order partial derivative with respect to u can be expressed as(12)‖Ruu(u)‖≤2n(n−1)U1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖+2nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖,where(13)U1=max|j|=2,|i|=n−2{ωi+2e1ωi+j,ωi+e1+e3ωi+j,ωi+2e3ωi+j},(14)W1=max|j|=1,|i|=n−1{|Δ1ωi|ωi+j},andQi,pis defined by Eq.(3).ProofThe partial derivative ofRu(u)with respect to u is computed as(15)Ruu=F1(u)−2F2(u),where(16)F1(u)=Fu(u)D2(u),(17)F2(u)=Ru(u)Du(u)D(u),(18)Fu(u)=Nuu(u)D(u)−Duu(u)N(u).Note that(19)‖Ruu(u)‖≤‖F1(u)‖+2‖F2(u)‖.First we address the bound onF1(u). Computing the derivative ofDu(u)andNu(u)with respect to u, we have(20)Duu(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2Bin−2(Δ1ωi+e1−Δ1ωi+e3),(21)Nuu(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2Bin−2(Δ1ωi+e1Ri+e1−Δ1ωi+e3Ri+e3).Using Eq. (20) and Eq. (21), we have(22)Fu(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2∑|p|=nBin−2Bpnωp(Di+e1,p−Di+e3,p).By using Lemma 1 twice, we haveFu(u)=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nBinBpnωp(iD˜i−e1,p+jD˜i−e2,p+kD˜i−e3,p),whereD˜i,p=i¯(Di,p−Di+e3−e1,p)+j¯(Di+e1−e2,p−Di+e3−e2,p)+k¯(Di+e1−e3,p−Di,p), with|i|=n−1,i¯+j¯+k¯=n−1.Using Lemma 5, and together withD2(u)in Eq. (9), we obtain‖F1(u)‖=‖Fu(u)D2(u)‖≤max|i|=|p|=n{‖iD˜i−e1,p+jD˜i−e2,p+kD˜i−e3,pωi‖}.By the convex hull property, it follows that‖F1(u)‖≤nmax|i|=|p|=n{‖D˜i−e1,pωi‖,‖D˜i−e2,pωi‖,‖D˜i−e3,pωi‖}=nmax|i|=n−1|p|=n,|j1|=1{‖D˜i,pωi+j1‖}.Similarly,‖D˜i,pωi+j1‖≤(n−1)max|j1|=|j2|=1|p|=n,|i|=n−2{‖Di+e1,p−Di+e3,pωi+j1+j2‖}.By using Lemma 4, the above magnitude can be further bounded by‖D˜i,pωi+j1‖≤2(n−1)U1max|i|=n−2,|p|=n{‖Ri+2e1−Rp‖,‖Ri+e1+e3−Rp‖,‖Ri+2e1−Ri+e1+e3‖,‖Ri+2e3−Rp‖,‖Ri+2e3−Ri+e1+e3‖},withU1defined by Eq. (13). Hence, we have(23)‖F1(u)‖≤2n(n−1)U1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖.Second, we consider the bound onF2(u). By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we haveDu(u)=∑|i|=nBin(iΔ1ωi−e1+jΔ1ωi−e2+kΔ1ωi−e3),withi+j+k=n.Again, by Lemma 5, we obtain(24)‖Du(u)D(u)‖≤nW1,withW1defined by Eq. (14). Based on Eq. (17), Eq. (24) and Theorem 1, we have(25)‖F2(u)‖≤‖Ru(u)‖‖Du(u)D(u)‖≤nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖.The bound ofRuu(u)follows immediately from Eq. (23) and Eq. (25).  □The bound onRvv(u)can be derived in the same fashion asRuu(u). In the following, we will derive the bound on the mixed partial derivative.Theorem 3For a rational triangular Bézier surface of degree n defined by(1), its mixed partial derivative satisfies(26)‖Ruv(u)‖≤2n(n−1)U2max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖+nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Pi,p‖+nW2max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖,whereW1,Qi,pandPi,pare defined by Eqs.(14),(3)and(11)respectively, and(27)W2=max|j|=1,|i|=n−1{|Δ2ωi|ωi+j},(28)U2=max|j|=2,|i|=n−2{ωi+e1+e2ωi+j,ωi+e2+e3ωi+j,ωi+e1+e3ωi+j,ωi+2e3ωi+j}.ProofAccording to the symmetry of second-order derivatives, the mixed partial derivativesRuv(u)andRvu(u)are equal to each other, hence we haveRuv(u)=(Ruv(u)+Rvu(u))/2.With a little calculation, we have(29)Ruv(u)=M1(u)−M2(u)−M3(u),whereM1(u)=Nuv(u)D(u)−Duv(u)N(u)D2(u),M2(u)=Ru(u)Dv(u)D(u),M3(u)=Rv(u)Du(u)D(u).Hence, we have(30)‖Ruv(u)‖≤‖M1(u)‖+‖M2(u)‖+‖M3(u)‖.First we estimate the bound onM1(u). By computing the derivatives of functionsNu(u)andDu(u)with respect to v, we haveNuv(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2Bin−2(Δ1ωi+e2Ri+e2−Δ1ωi+e3Ri+e3),Duv(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2Bin−2(Δ1ωi+e2−Δ1ωi+e3).ThenNuv(u)D(u)−Duv(u)N(u)=n(n−1)∑|i|=n−2∑|p|=nBin−2Bpnωp(Di+e2,p−Di+e3,p).By applying Lemma 1 twice, it can further be reduced toNuv(u)D(u)−Duv(u)N(u)=∑|i|=n∑|p|=nBinBpnωp(iL˜i−e1,p+jL˜i−e2,p+kL˜i−e3,p),whereL˜i,p=i¯(Di+e2−e1,p−Di+e3−e1,p)+j¯(Di,p−Di+e3−e2,p)+k¯(Di+e2−e3,p−Di,p), with|i|=n−1andi¯+j¯+k¯=n−1.ByD2(u)defined by Eq. (9) and Lemma 5, we obtain‖M1(u)‖≤max|i|=|p|=n{‖iL˜i−e1,p+jL˜i−e2,p+kL˜i−e3,pωi‖}≤nmax|j1|=1,|p|=n|i|=n−1{‖L˜i,pωi+j1‖}≤n(n−1)max|i|=n−2,|p|=n|j1|=|j2|=1{‖Di+e2,p−Di+e3,pωi+j1+j2‖}.The item within the curly braces above can further be reduced by Lemma 4 as follows‖Di+e2,p−Di+e3,pωi+j1+j2‖≤2U2max|i|=n−2,|p|=n|j1|=|j2|=1{‖Ri+e1+e2−Rp‖,‖Ri+e2+e3−Rp‖,‖Ri+e1+e3−Rp‖,‖Ri+e1+e2−Ri+e2+e3‖,‖Ri+2e3−Rp‖,‖Ri+e1+e3−Ri+2e3‖}.Therefore, we have(31)‖M1(u)‖≤2n(n−1)U2max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,whereU2is defined by Eq. (28).Next,we estimate the bound onM2(u). Similar to Eq. (24), we have(32)‖Dv(u)D(u)‖≤nW2,withW2defined by Eq. (27).Then based on Theorem 1 and Eq. (32),M2(u)can be bounded by(33)‖M2(u)‖≤‖Ru(u)‖‖Dv(u)D(u)‖≤nW2max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖.The bound ofM3(u)can be obtained in the same manner as follows(34)‖M3(u)‖≤nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Pi,p‖,whereW1andPi,pare defined by Eqs. (14) and (11) respectively. The proof is completed by substituting Eqs. (31), (33) and (34) into Eq. (30).  □In this section, we will show that our bounds are the tightest ones thus far. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three previous literatures, i.e., Zhang and Wang (2005), Hu and Wang (2007) and Cao et al. (2007), concerning on estimating the bounds on the magnitudes of the derivatives of triangular Bézier surfaces. It has been proved by Hu and Wang (2007) that their bounds are tighter than the bounds in Zhang and Wang (2005). Therefore, to conclude that our bounds are the tightest ones so far, we only have to prove that our bounds are tighter than the ones in the last two papers (Hu and Wang, 2007; Cao et al., 2007). In order to do that, we first show that the bounds proposed by Hu and Wang (2007) are tighter than the bounds proposed by Cao et al. (2007). Then we prove that our bounds are tighter than those in Hu and Wang (2007).The bounds in Hu and Wang (2007) are as follows:(35)‖Ru(u)‖≤nM1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,(36)‖Ruu(u)‖≤n[2(n−1)U1+nM12+2nM1W1]×max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,(37)‖Ruv(u)‖≤n[2(n−1)U2+nM1M2+2nM1W2]×max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,whereU1,U2,W1,W2are defined by Eqs. (13), (28), (14), (27), andM1=max|i|=n−1,|j|=1{ωi+e1ωi+j,ωi+e3ωi+j},M2=max|i|=n−1,|j|=1{ωi+e2ωi+j,ωi+e3ωi+j}.The bounds in Cao et al. (2007) are as follows:(38)‖Ru(u)‖≤nV1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,(39)‖Ruu(u)‖≤n[4(n−1)V2+4nV12]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,(40)‖Ruv(u)‖≤n[4(n−1)V2+4nV12]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,whereV1=max|i|=n−1,|j|=1{ωi+e1ωi+j,ωi+e2ωi+j,ωi+e3ωi+j},V2=max|i|=n−2,|j|=2{ωi+2e1ωi+j,ωi+e1+e2ωi+j,ωi+e1+e3ωi+j,ωi+2e2ωi+j,ωi+e2+e3ωi+j,ωi+2e3ωi+j}.The definitions ofV1andV2imply that:U1,U2≤V2,M1,M2,W1,W2≤V1,which immediately give relations that (35), (36) and (37) are tighter than (38), (39) and (40), respectively.Now we verify that our bounds are tighter than the bounds in Hu and Wang (2007). For ease of subsequent explanation, we defineA1(i,p)=‖iDi−e1,p+jDi−e2,p+kDi−e3,pωi‖,A2(i,p)=‖pDp−e1,i+qDp−e2,i+rDp−e3,iωp‖,with|i|=|p|=n.Obviously, sets{A1(i,p)}and{A2(i,p)}with|i|=|p|=nare equivalent, hence we have‖Qi,p‖≤12(A1(i,p)+A2(i,p))≤max|i|=|p|=n{A1(i,p)}≤nmax|i|=n−1|p|=n,|j|=1‖Di,pωi+j‖.On the other hand, Lemma 3 implies that‖Di,pωi+j‖≤max|j|=1|i|=n−1{ωi+e1ωi+j,ωi+e3ωi+j}max|p|=n|i|=n−1{‖Ri+e1−Ri+e3‖,‖Ri+e1−Rp‖,‖Ri+e3−Rp‖}≤max|j|=1|i|=n−1{ωi+e1ωi+j,ωi+e3ωi+j}max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖.Therefore, we have(41)‖Qi,p‖≤nM1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,i.e., (2) is tighter than (35). Based on Eq. (41), we also have(42)2n(n−1)U1max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖+2nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖≤[2n(n−1)U1+2n2M1W1]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖<n[2(n−1)U1+nM12+2nM1W1]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,that is, (12) is tighter than (36). Similar to Eq. (41), we have‖Pi,p‖≤nM2max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖.As all weightsωiare positive, we can easily verify thatM1,M2≥1,W1<M1, then(43)2n(n−1)U2max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖+nW1max|i|=|p|=n‖Pi,p‖+nW2max|i|=|p|=n‖Qi,p‖≤n[2(n−1)U2+nW1M2+nM1W2]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖<n[2(n−1)U2+nM1M2+2nM1W2]max|i|=|p|=n‖Ri−Rp‖,confirms that (26) is tighter than (37).From Eqs. (42) and (43), it is easy to confirm that our new bounds onRuu(u)andRuv(u)(whenωi≠constant) are strictly less than the corresponding bounds in Hu and Wang (2007). Consequently, our bounds are theoretically tighter than the existing ones (Zhang and Wang, 2005; Hu and Wang, 2007; Cao et al., 2007).Numerical experiments are performed below to verify the results in the previous sections. In our experiments, the normalized bounds (the ratios of the estimated bounds to their ground truth bounds) instead of the estimated bounds themselves are compared, and hereinafter, the bounds (denoted by‖⋅‖) mean the normalized bounds when there is no ambiguity. Intuitively, the estimated bound is closer to the ground truth bound, the normalized bound is closer to 1 (the logarithm of the normalized bound is closer to 0). In the following experiments, the ground truth bound of a derivative is approximated by the maximum magnitude of the derivatives at evenly sampled parametric points{(u,v)|u=i100,v=j100,i,j=0,⋯,100,u+v≤1}.As our bounds are related to both weights and the convex hulls of control points, we compare ours and known bounds in Hu and Wang (2007), Cao et al. (2007) in two ways. In the first comparison, we setn=3andωi=ωi,j,k=2j/5k. The control pointsRi=(x,y,z)are randomly generated with x, y, z in interval[−1,1]. Then the bounds proposed in this paper and those in Hu and Wang (2007), Cao et al. (2007) are computed and compared. This experiment has been performed 101 times. In Fig. 1, the horizontal axis and vertical axis represent the number of tests and the normalized bounds (‖Ru‖), respectively. The black solid lines stand for the ratio of our bounds to the ground truth bounds, the gray dash lines and brown dash–dot lines stand for the ratio of the bounds obtained by Hu and Wang (2007) and Cao et al. (2007) to the ground truth ones, respectively. The pink solid lines stand for the reference lines (y=1). It can be observed that our new bounds are closer to the ground truth bounds than the bounds in Cao et al. (2007), Hu and Wang (2007) are, as the normalized bounds are closer to 1. The superiority of the bounds on the second-order derivatives‖Ruu‖and‖Ruv‖can be verified in Fig. 2and Fig. 3, respectively.In the second comparison we consider the rational cubic triangular Bézier surface with fixed control pointsR300=(2,1,−0.5),R210=(1.5,1,0),R120=(1,1,0.5),R030=(0,1,1),R021=(0,0,0.5),R012=(0,−0.5,0),R003=(0,−1,−0.5),R102=(0.75,0,−0.75),R201=(−1,0.5,−1),R111=(1,0,0)and weights randomly sampled in interval[0,5]. Again, this experiment was performed 101 times. The normalized bounds of first- and second-order derivatives are displayed by log-linear graphs in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, respectively, where the vertical axis represents the logarithmically scaled bounds and the horizontal axis represents the number of tests. The reference lines (pink solid lines) becomey=0in these log-linear plots. Our bounds and those in Cao et al. (2007), Hu and Wang (2007) are marked as black solid lines, gray dash lines and brown dash–dot lines, respectively. It can be observed that our bounds are closer to the reference lines than the bounds of Cao et al. (2007), Hu and Wang (2007), confirming that our bounds are superior to the known bounds in Cao et al. (2007), Hu and Wang (2007).For the numerical experiments above, we only illustrated the comparison of the bounds of cubic rational triangular Bézier surfaces. For cubic surfaces with fixed control points or fixed weights, our bounds provide approximation of ground truth bounds with higher accuracies. We also compared the bounds of rational triangular Bézier surfaces of higher degrees, and found that the results are similar to the cubic case, hence are not reported.
