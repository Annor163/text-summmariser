@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Optical properties of seven regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene) with different alkyl side chain lengths which are poly(3-butylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3BT), poly(3-pentylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3PT), poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), poly(3-heptylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3hept), poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3OT), poly(3-decylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3DT), and poly(3-dodecylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3DDT) have been studied in the mid-infrared (IR) spectral region by means of Fourier Transformation Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and IR spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE). Absorbance spectra obtained in this fingerprint region are potential to characterize the structures formed by organic molecules in thin films due to molecular vibrations in detail. In consequence, the vibrational absorption bands of these seven samples demonstrated that P3PT, P3HT, and P3hept exhibited very similar band profiles, in contrast, the stretching vibration of thiophene rings (≈1465cm−1: CC) underwent a blue shift in P3BT, P3OT, P3DT and P3DDT. The highest value of the real part (ɛ1) of the complex dielectric constant was obtained from P3HT on both indium thin oxide (ITO) and silicon (Si) substrates whereas the imaginary part (ε2) was directly affected by increasing in the alkyl side chain lengths in a frequency range around 3000cm−1. The optical properties of P3PT in the mid-IR region developed an affinity with those of P3HT. Thus, P3PT is particularly a suitable polymer active material candidate for high-performance devices.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thiophene-based conjugated semiconducting polymers such as regioregular P3ATs (P3BT, P3PT, P3HT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT) have been extensively studied for applications in optoelectronics such as organic field-effect transistors (OFET), organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and organic solar cells. One of the most well-known examples is P3HT as a p-type semiconductor material that has reached a charge carrier mobility of 0.1cm2/Vs [1,2]. In order to improve the mobility of P3HT, investigations on molecular orientations [3,4], crystallization processes [5], various sorts of solvents for a wet process sample preparation [6], and the characteristic effects of doping [7] have been carried out so far. Furthermore, after different alkyl side chain lengths of P3ATs have been developed, correlation of physical and optical properties with the alkyl side chain (CnH2n+1) length was analyzed in detail. P3AT/PCBM blend investigations revealed that as the alkyl side chain increased, solubility increased as well as photocurrents in general [8]. Conversely, absorption coefficient reduced as the alkyl side chain length increased due to less interspace between molecules [8]. The hole mobility of P3ATs was determined by output characteristics [9]. In this study, P3HT indicated the highest hole mobility value (1×10−2cm2/Vs) followed by P3BT (1.2×10−3cm2/Vs), P3OT (2.0×10−4cm2/Vs), P3DT (6.6×10−5cm2/Vs), and P3DDT (2.4×10−4cm2/Vs) in virtue of the superlative self-assembling ability. An even–odd effect in number of monomers has been confirmed in poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) and poly(phenylene-vinylene) systems [10], rigid-flexible polymers [11], and alkane thiol monolayers on gold [12]. These investigations revealed that the even–odd effect exceedingly influenced the transition temperatures, the molecular orientation angles, and the chain packing arrangements. Electrical properties of P3PT have been examined in UV and visible regions [13,14]. As a result, P3PT was presumed to be a possible candidate as a p-type semiconductor material since P3PT thin films exhibited a high degree of crystallinity with a π–π stacking distance, d010 of 3.74Å [14] which was very close to that of P3HT (3.8Å) [15].In this paper, we examined the optical properties of seven regioregular P3ATs with alkyl side chain of CnH2n+1: n=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 (P3BT, P3PT, P3HT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT), respectively, by means of FTIR spectroscopy in a frequency range between 800 and 3300cm−1. FTIR spectroscopy provides detailed information of each molecular bonding since absorption/transmission spectra represent the fingerprint of a material along with absorption peaks that are generated by vibrational transitions of atomic bonds. In addition, the dielectric properties of odd-numbered P3hept and P3PT on Si and ITO substrates in the fingerprint region have been derived by the use of IRSE which is a technique that measures the variations in the polarization state of an incident light before and after reflection on a surface of a target material. Hereby accurate film thicknesses of thin films and their complex dielectric functions can be determined. The dielectric function of P3HT (even-numbered) has been derived as well in order to make a comparative study to odd-numbered materials. Moreover the surface roughness of all seven P3AT films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).FTIR spectrometers (Bruker IFS 66 v/S & Vertex 80V) with a Deuterated Triglycine Sulfate (DTGS) detector were used for the measurements of IR spectra (absorbance) in a frequency range between 450 and 5500cm−1. All the absorbance measurements were carried out with a resolution of 4cm−1 and a sample scan time of 1000 scans under a vacuum pressure between 2 and 5mbar.ψ and Δ spectrum measurements were performed in a frequency range between 333 and 6000cm−1 with an angle of incidence of 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70° under normal pressure by a rotating compensator IR ellipsometer from J. A. Woollam Co., Inc. (IR-VASE). In order to obtain the dielectric functions and the precise thickness of a thin film, ψ and Δ measured spectra were fitted based on an optical model by the use of WVASE32 software [37]. Fundamentally, these parameters are related to the Fresnel reflection coefficient rp(p-polarized) and rs(s-polarized) which determines the complex reflectance ratio ρ. Thus the complex reflectance ratio ρ can be described as:(1)ρ=r̃pr̃s=tan(ψ)eiΔwhere tanψ denotes the relative amplitude attenuation while Δ represents the phase shift of the p and s linearly polarized components due to reflection.Oscillations of atomic bonds are usually observed in the IR range due to a change in the dipole moment. The optical properties of an isotropic layer can then be expressed as a summation of Lorentzian oscillators(2)ε(ω)=ε1+iε2=ε∞+∑j=1Nsjωj2ωj2-ω2iγjωwhere ε1 is the real part of the dielectric function, ε2 the imaginary part of the dielectric function, ε∞a real constant, N the number of oscillators, sjan amplitude of the jth oscillator, γjthe damping factor of the jth oscillator, ωjthe broadening parameter related to the jth oscillator, and ω the resonance frequency.A film thickness can be determined by interferences between light reflected from different surfaces:(3)d=βλ2πN22-N12sin2(Φ1)where d is the film thickness, β the phase factor,λthe wavelength of light, N1 the refractive index of surroundings, N2 the refractive index of a film, andϕ1the angle of incidence [16,17].We have acquired commercially available regioregular P3BT, P3PT, P3hept, P3OT, P3DT, and P3DDT from Rieke Metals Inc. [18], and P3HT (Lisicon SP001; molecular weight (MW) 43600 and regioregularity (RR≈95.9)) from Merck KGaA. It has been reported that solubility and field-effect mobilities of P3HT films were improved by dint of high boiling point (BT) solvents such as 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (BP: 213.5°) and 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (BP: 180°) due to progress of self-assembly [6,19]. Thus we selected 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (Merck KGaA) as a solvent for this investigation. Weight ratio percentage concentration of all the solutions was fixed to 2%. The solutions were placed on a hot plate with a temperature between 60 and 70°C for 30min so as to dissolve them thoroughly. All samples were prepared by spin coating process (SPS Europe: SPIN150-NPP) at rotation speed of 4000rpm on Si wafers and ITO coated glass substrates (SiO2 barrier coating was applied on polished soda lime float glass, and the ITO, resistance 7Ω/sq, was deposited on it, VisionTek Systems Ltd. for both FTIR and IRSE measurements. As additional information, Drude metal modeling was employed for fitting the optical data of the ITO coated glass substrates.
