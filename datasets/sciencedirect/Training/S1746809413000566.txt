HRV spectral estimation based on constrained Gaussian modeling in the nonstationary case

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
This definition of heart rate variability frequency bands is controversial because of possible changes in the frequency boundaries.We propose the constrained Gaussian modeling (CGM) method that dynamically models the power spectrum as a two Gaussian shapes mixture.A greater sensitivity was observed with the CGM method in the case of transitory cardiac events.The CGM method showed a better score in the case of a classification purpose.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The heart rate variability (HRV) spectral parameters are classically used for studying the autonomic nervous system, as they allow the evaluation of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on heart rhythm. However, this evaluation is usually based on fixed frequency regions, which does not allow possible variation, or is based on an adaptive individual time dependent spectral boundaries (ITSB) method sensitive to noisy environments. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose the constrained Gaussian modeling (CGM) method that dynamically models the power spectrum as a two Gaussian shapes mixture. It appeared that this procedure was able to accurately follow the exact parameters in the case of simulated data, in comparison with a parameter estimation obtained with a rigid frequency cutting approach or with the ITSB algorithm. Real data results obtained on a classical stand-test and on the Fantasia database are also presented and discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The heart rate variability (HRV) can be evaluated by analyzing the oscillations of the RR intervals of electrocardiograms. The analysis of these variabilities has been shown to be an indicator of health [1–3].The HRV variation is controlled by two branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS): the parasympathetic (vagal nerve) and the sympathetic branches. These two ANS activities can be dissociated in respective frequency domains with the parasympathetic branch in the high frequency domain (HF) and the both branches in the low frequency domain (LF) [4]. Furthermore, in HRV analysis, the LF, HF power spectrum parameters are estimated using predetermined fixed frequency ranges. However, for a given parameter, different frequency ranges occur in the literature. The LF band in Hz has been defined as: 0.04–0.15 [3], 0.01–0.15 [5], 0.02–0.15 [6], 0.03–0.15 [7], 0.05–0.15 [8] or 0.045–0.15 [9]. The HF band in Hz has been defined as: 0.15–0.4 [3], 0.18–0.4 [6,8], 0.15–0.6 [7], 0.15–1 [9] or 0.2–0.4 [6,10]. Moreover, in some specific conditions (exercise), it was reported [11] that the upper boundary of the HF domain has to be increased with the exercise intensity. These unstable frequency limits can be explained by individual ranges. Indeed, the ranges can strongly be affected by physiologic conditions (body position, breathing frequency, etc.). Even if an effort has been made in the Task Force [3] for a boundaries standardization, no reliable method for the appropriate selection of frequency ranges is proposed. From the analysis of the various boundaries, it appears that while other boundaries may differ, a separation frequency between the LF and the HF bands is always equal to 0.15Hz [12]. For this reason, the method proposed in this paper will be based on this essential result.The other difficulty encountered in frequency-domain processing is the nonstationary behavior of HRV signal. This is because the interbeat interval of the heart rhythm significantly varies due to irregularities in the initiation of the cardiac impulse in the atrium. Moreover, daily human activities in ecological situations can also enforce the nonstationary property of the HRV. These nonstationarities become more severe in abnormal cardiac rhythms [7]. Time–frequency or time–variant methods were proposed to process nonstationary signals. For example, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), selective discrete Fourier transform algorithm (SDA), Wigner-Ville distribution or time–variant autoregressive modeling provide estimates of spectral power as a function of time [13–17].Besides, the bounds defining the low and high frequency regions may dynamically vary and instantaneous bounds should be defined. It is therefore necessary to use a method that makes the boundaries adapt to the data as a function of time. A solution has been proposed in [18] with the individual time dependant spectral boundaries (ITSB) algorithm. ITSB algorithm seeks the maximum value within a predefined sufficiently large frequency region. Then it locates the two minima surrounding this peak. This procedure is repeated for every spectral frame in time, obtaining time-dependent boundaries. However, when many minima occur in the same band, ITSB rejects some parts of the power spectrum and tends to underestimate the LF and/or HF power parameters. This method seems therefore to be sensitive to noisy data.The goal of this study is to propose a method based on time–frequency analysis associated with Gaussian modeling of the time–frequency spectra. Two Gaussian curves at each time are estimated for respectively the low frequency, and the high frequency. For these reasons, the method is named constraint Gaussian model (CGM). This model is expected to be robust to the strong variability encountered in real data. The interests in using Gaussian fits rely on the following points:•No rigid cutting is necessary for the fitting, the only assumption is the two Gaussian bells that have to be estimated.The fitting is robust to noisy spectra and clearly points out the two desired LF and HF frequency bands.The fitting is applied at each instant making the LF, HF power spectrum, and LF/HF ratio time-dependent.The paper constitutes a substantial extension of a previous communication [19] with an extension of the experimental evaluation on noise robustness and interesting application for classification. The paper is organized as follows: the next section will present the method; results on simulated data and real data are presented in Section 3.
