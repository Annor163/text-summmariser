@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported to involve postganglionic sympathetic failure and a wide spectrum of autonomic dysfunctions including cardiovascular, sexual, bladder, gastrointestinal and sudo-motor abnormalities. While these symptoms may have a significant impact on daily activities, as well as quality of life, the evaluation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunctions relies on a large and expensive battery of autonomic tests only accessible in highly specialized laboratories. In this paper we aim to devise a comprehensive computational assessment of disease-related heartbeat dynamics based on instantaneous, time-varying estimates of spontaneous (resting state) cardiovascular oscillations in PD. To this end, we combine standard ANS-related heart rate variability (HRV) metrics with measures of instantaneous complexity (dominant Lyapunov exponent and entropy) and higher-order statistics (bispectra). Such measures are computed over 600-s recordings acquired at rest in 29 healthy subjects and 30 PD patients. The only significant group-wise differences were found in the variability of the dominant Lyapunov exponent. Also, the best PD vs. healthy controls classification performance (balanced accuracy: 73.47%) was achieved only when retaining the time-varying, non-stationary structure of the dynamical features, whereas classification performance dropped significantly (balanced accuracy: 61.91%) when excluding variability-related features. Additionally, both linear and nonlinear model features correlated with both clinical and neuropsychological assessments of the considered patient population. Our results demonstrate the added value and potential of instantaneous measures of heartbeat dynamics and its variability in characterizing PD-related disabilities in motor and cognitive domains.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, and is classically associated with motor symptoms including tremor, balance problems, limb rigidity, bradykinesia and gait abnormalities [12]. The causes and etiology of PD are still largely unknown, and current literature is inconclusive when it comes to isolating reliable predictors of disease incidence and evolution. In this context, older age (>60 years), iposmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, and depression are the major risk factors for PD that have been consistently found across studies [12,43].PD is frequently associated with symptoms of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) dysfunction and/or failure [26], including cardiovascular, sexual, bladder, gastrointestinal, and sudo-motor abnormalities [2]. These clinical evidences are in agreement with the results of pathological studies demonstrating how the degenerative process in PD involves subcortical structures, brainstem and medullary autonomic centers as well as post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers [30]. Accordingly, Lewy bodies (the pathological hallmark of PD) have been found in a number of ANS regions such as the hypothalamus and the sympathetic/parasympathetic systems [44,45].While cardiovascular dysautonomia has traditionally been associated with the later stages of PD, it has recently become evident that it can occur at any disease stage, and that its onset can even precede the appearance of motor symptoms [2,18,49]. Previous studies have reported a variable prevalence of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in PD, ranging from 23% to 80% as determined by studies which included cohorts of between 20 and 91 patients [3,29,35]. Within these reports, conflicting evidence exists about the extent and characteristics of PD-related aberrations in cardiovascular control. As an example, two studies have described orthostatic hypotension and a decreased heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver [1,28], while other authors have found that pressure and heart rate response during these procedures remained normal [25,33].It is well know that ANS outflow can be estimated non-invasively using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis [42], and recently HRV measures have been employed to explore ANS alterations in PD by evaluating the modulatory effects of ANS dynamics on sinus node activity [21]. According to the study by Haapaniemi et al. [16], when analyzing 24h ECG recordings all HRV spectral components were found to be significantly lower in PD patients when compared to controls [16]. In another study, which evaluated 10 consecutive minutes of resting ECG recordings, HRV High Frequency (HF) power (thought to mainly reflect parasympathetic activity) was significantly different between healthy controls and untreated (i.e., de novo) PD patients, whereas nonlinear HRV analysis based on entropy and geometrical measures did not show any statistical differences between the two groups [20]. However, other authors documented an increase in complexity of systolic arterial pressure in PD patients when compared to controls [32]. In addition, while the physiology underlying complexity-related measures of heartbeat dynamics is still unknown, it is well known that their quantification can provide meaningful information on psychophysiological as well as pathological states [8,10,14,24,39]. In this context, we have previously shown that measures of time-varying complexity provide enhanced discriminatory power when compared to standard complexity measures [36,38], and that the stability and complexity of autonomic dynamics is altered in PD patients when compared to healthy controls as well as within different PD subgroups [4,6].In this paper we aim to devise a comprehensive assessment of disease-related ANS alterations based on instantaneous, time-varying estimates of spontaneous (resting state) cardiovascular oscillations in PD. To this end, we employ our instantaneous inhomogeneous point-process framework [36–38], which augments standard ANS-related HRV metrics defined in the time and frequency domains [5] with measures of instantaneous complexity (dominant Lyapunov exponent and entropy) [36,38] and higher-order statistics (bispectra) [37]. Additionally, in order to develop a processing chain in line with the clinical need of single-subject classification, we complement the study of group-wise statistical differences with the training and validation of an automatic classification algorithm which includes a feature selection procedure.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we provide details about the methods employed for data acquisitions, patient assessment, probabilistic modeling of the heartbeat, extraction of linear and nonlinear features and classification analysis. In Section 3, we illustrate the results of these procedures in the same order, and in Section 4 we discuss the implication of our results for characterizing cardiovascular dysautonomia in PD through non-invasive, instantaneous HRV modeling.Plethysmographic (PPG) signals were recorded with a sample frequency of 50Hz from 29 healthy controls (HC), 18 males, 11 females, age 60.63±4.93 years, median±MAD, where MAD(X)=Median(|X−Median(X)|) and 30 PD patients (23 males, 7 females, age 66.51±4.06 years, median±MAD). Between the two groups, no significant difference was found in age (p=0.15, Mann–Whitney test, null-hypothesis of equal medians) and gender (p=0.46, Chi square test, null-hypothesis of no gender effect). Subjects were placed horizontally in a supine position and remained at rest during the whole recording (600s). During the acquisition, all subjects were instructed not to talk and maintained relaxed spontaneous breathing. All participants gave written informed consent to participating in the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee. An overview of the experimental set-up and block scheme of the overall signal processing and classification chain is shown in Fig. 1.Clinical assessment included history of disease's related symptoms and signs, and full neurological examination. All patients were screened for cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction which was considered as exclusion criterion. All patients had to satisfy the UK Brain Bank criteria for the diagnosis of PD [13] and were in stage 1, 1.5 2 or 2.5 according to the Hoehn & Yahr (HY) system. As supportive criterion, a 123IFP-CIT SPECT to confirm nigrostriatal degeneration was performed. With the aim of exploring how much information about clinical disability can be extracted from our HRV assesment framework, severity of parkinsonism was evaluated by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) [31] and the HY staging system [17]. Possible abnormalities in the affective domain were investigated through the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Patient population was comprised of 15 de novo PD patients (i.e. naive/drug free patients in the initial stage of the disease) and 15 patients with more advanced PD, which necessarily were on dopaminergic drugs (i.e. dopamine agonist and levodopa therapy, no other drugs were permitted). No patients of these 15 treated PD showed complications such as wearing-off, on–off and/or dyskinesia. Moreover, in order to avoid the possible interference of levodopa on cardiac function, we have assessed HRV measures in the morning before the first levodopa dose. Only one patient had a HY score ≥2, whereas all other patients had 1 or 1.5. The overall disease duration was 1.6 years (standard deviation in 0.35 years).Additionally, in order to explore putative associations between our HRV-related features and PD-related disabilities in the cognitive domain, we evaluated our patients through a pool of standardized neuropsychological tests that included at least two tests within each of the five cognitive domains [50]. Specifically, we examined: (1) attention and working memory domain (by Trail Making Test, TMT_B, and Stroop Test, Stroop_E, – both errors and time parameters), (2) executive functions (by Frontal Assessment Battery, FAB, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Analogy Subtest, Analogie_W, and Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test), (3) language (by Boston Naming Test, Boston_60, and Phonemic Fluency), (4) memory (by Memory Prose and Verbal Learning Pair Task), (5) visuospatial ability (by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Drawing Cubes Subtest and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation, Benton_JLO). Global cognitive status was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.By using the inhomogeneous point process model of heartbeat dynamics [5], we model the unevenly sampled RR interval series through probability density functions (pdf) characterizing and predicting the time until the next event occurs as a function of the past history. Within this framework, Laguerre expansions of the Wiener–Volterra linear and nonlinear autoregressive terms account for long-term nonlinear information [36–38]. As major advantages, instantaneous measures can be estimated without applying any interpolation techniques to the RR interval series, and are associated to effective goodness-of-fit measures.In general, a random point process is a stochastic process comprising the occurrence in time of discrete events, which in our case are represented by the heartbeats. As a consequence, it is possible to characterize the pdf of the next ventricular contraction through a parametric formulation of the past heartbeat events (see Fig. 2). Motivated by both goodness-of-fit as well as by physiological reasons, an inverse Gaussian pdf was used to model the R-beat series [5]:(1)f(t|Ht,ξ(t))=ξ0(t)2π(t−uj)3exp−12ξ0(t)[t−uj−μRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))]2μRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))2(t−uj)where:•t∈(0, T], the observation interval;0≤u1<⋯<uk<uk+1<⋯<uK≤T the times of the events;RRj=ujuj−1>0 the jth RR interval;{uj}j=1Jthe R-wave events, andj=N˜(t)the index of the previous R-wave event before time tN(t)=max{k:uk≤t} the sample path of the counting process of the RR interval series;N˜(t)=N(t−)=limτ→t−N(τ)=max{k:uk<t}Ht=(uj,RRj,RRj−1,...,RRj−M+1);ξ(t) the vector of the model time-varying parameters;μRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))the first-moment statistic (mean) of the distribution;ξ0(t)>0 the shape parameter of the inverse Gaussian distribution;Accounting for history dependence,f(t|Ht,ξ(t))is thus able to predict the next heartbeat event. This function is parametrized in its first-order moment as a Nonlinear Autoregressive model with Laguerre expansions (NARL) of the Volterra terms:(2)μRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))=RRN˜(t)+g0(t)+∑i=0pg1(i,t)li(t−)+∑i=0q∑j=0qg2(i,j,t)li(t−)lj(t−).where(3)li(t−)=∑n=1N˜(t)ϕi(n)(RRN˜(t)−n−RRN˜(t)−n−1)is the output of the Laguerre filters just before time t, and(4)ϕi(n)=α(n−i)/2(1−α)1/2∑k=0i(−1)knkikαi−k(1−α)k,(n≥0)is the ith-order discrete time orthonormal Laguerre function and α is the discrete-time Laguerre parameter (0<α<1) which determines the rate of exponential asymptotic decline.The coefficients g0, {g1(i)} with i=0, …p, and {g2(i, j)} with {i, j}=0, …, q correspond to the time-varying zero-, first-, second-order NARL coefficients, respectively, and performing the Laguerre expansion on the derivative R–R series improves stationarity within the sliding time window W (in this work we have chosen W=90s) [15,37]. The corresponding nonlinear autoregressive Volterra–Wiener long-term memory model with second-order nonlinearity becomes [27]:(5)μRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))=RRN˜(t)+γ0+∑i=1∞γ1(i,t)(RRN˜(t)−i−RRN˜(t)−i−1)+∑i=1∞∑j=1∞γ2(i,j,t)(RRN˜(t)−i−RRN˜(t)−i−1)×(RRN˜(t)−j−RRN˜(t)−j−1)AsμRR(t,Ht,ξ(t))is defined in continuous time, it is possible to obtain an instantaneous R–R mean estimate at arbitraty timescales without interpolating between the arrival times of two consecutive heartbeats.Given a local observation interval (t−l, t] of duration l, we consider a subset Um:nof the R-wave events, where m=N(t−l)+1 and n=N(t) and, at each time t, we find the unknown time-varying parameter vector ξ(t) that maximizes the local log-likelihood [5]:(6)L(ξ(t)|Um:n)=∑k=m+p−1n−1w(t−uk+1)log[f(uk+1|Huk+1,ξ(t))]+log∫t∞f(τ|Ht,ξ(t))dτwherew(τ)=e−ϖτis an exponential weighting function for the local likelihood. The constant ϖ (together with l) governs the degree of influence of previous observations on the local likelihood and determines the trade-off between the accuracy of the estimation of the regression parameters (small ϖ) and the responsiveness to non-stationarities (large ϖ). In Eq. (6), the first summation term accounts for the past, completely-observed, R–R intervals information, while the latter term accounts for the next, not yet observed, R–R interval (right censoring). We use a Newton–Raphson procedure to maximize the local log-likelihood in Eq. (6), and compute the local maximum-likelihood estimate of ξ(t) [5]. Because there is significant overlap between adjacent local likelihood intervals, we initialize the Newton–Raphson procedure at t with the previous local maximum-likelihood estimate at time t−Δ, where Δ defines the time interval shift to compute the next parameter update. We determine the optimal order {p, q} based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and by prefitting the point process model goodness-of-fit to a subset of the data [5] and evaluating the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test and associated KS statistics [5]. At each iteration, the recursive, causal nature of the estimation allows to independently predict each new observation, given the previous history. The model and all its parameters are therefore also updated without priors at each iteration. In other words, each test point RRkis tested against one instance of a time-varying model trained with points {RRj} with j<k.Autocorrelation plots are also visually inspected to ensure that all points of the plot are within the 95% of the confidence interval, hence guaranteeing the independence of the model-transformed intervals [5]. In order to perform model order selection, we integrated the KS and autocorrelation analysis [5] by evaluating the AIC criterion using the whole recordings [5]. Specifically, model orders were chosen to minimize KS distance. When more than one order was associated to the same KS distance values, optimal model orders were chosed to minimize the AIC criterion. Once the order {p, q} is determined, the initial NARL coefficients are estimated by the method of least squares [40].In order to provide reliable results, the HRV processing techniques require uninterrupted series of RR intervals. Nevertheless, peak detection errors and ectopic beats often determine abrupt changes in the R–R interval series that may result in substantial deviations of the model-derived HRV indices and potentially bias statistical outcomes from intra- and inter-subject comparisons. To eliminate such anomalies we preprocessed all heartbeat data with a previously developed real-time R–R interval error detection and correction algorithm [9] based on the point process statistics (local likelihood). Briefly, the algorithm determines whether the actual observation is in agreement with the resulting model or if, instead, the alternative hypothesis of an erroneous beat is more likely.In order to provide quantitative tools related to standard measures defined in the time and frequency domains, higher order spectral representations, and complexity, it is necessary to link the NARL model to the traditional input–output Wiener–Volterra model [37]. Just like for any linear autoregressive model one can define equivalent infinite-memory moving average model, a quadratic NARL model can be linked to an input–output Volterra model, driven by the same NARL noise term. Then, the time-domain characterization is based on the first and the second order moments of the underlying probability structure. Given the time-varying parameter set ξ(t), the instantaneous estimates of mean μRR, and R–R interval standard deviation σRR can be extracted at each moment in time [5].Estimates in the frequency domain reveal the linear mechanisms governing heartbeat dynamics in the frequency domain. In particular, given the input–output Volterra kernels of the NARL model for the instantaneous R–R interval meanμRR(t,Ht,ξ(t)), we can compute the time-varying parametric (linear) autospectrumQ(f,t)[37]. By integratingQ(f,t)in each frequency band, we can compute the power within the very low frequency (VLF=0.01–0.05Hz), low frequency (LF=0.05–0.15Hz), and high frequency (HF=0.15–0.5Hz) ranges, along with their ratio (LF/HF). It has been well-recognized that the HF power is a reliable marker of parasympathetic activity [42]. Conversely, the LF power might be affected by both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities [42].The higher-order spectral representation allows for the estimation of statistics beyond the second order, and phase relations between frequency components which would otherwise be suppressed. A detailed description of the instantaneous bispectrum (B(f1, f2, t)) derivation from point-process nonlinear models can be found in [37]. This tool allows us to evaluate the instantaneous presence of nonlinearity in heartbeat series by calculating nonlinear sympatho-vagal interactions. Specifically, by integrating |B(f1, f2, t)| in the appropriate frequency bands, it is possible to obtain:(7)LL(t)=∫f1=0+0.15∫f2=0+0.15B(f1,f2,t)df1df2(8)LH(t)=∫f1=0+0.15∫f2=0.15+0.4B(f1,f2,t)df1df2(9)HH(t)=∫f1=0.15+0.4∫f2=0.15+0.4B(f1,f2,t)df1df2By expanding the quadratic regression described in Eq. (2) to the cubic order, and using a Fast Orthogonal Search algorithm, it is possible to estimate the complete Lyapunov Exponents (LE) spectrum at each moment in time [36], which provided additional and novel information about the dynamics of complexity and its variability. In this study, we use the Instantaneous Dominant Lyapunov Exponent (IDLE, λ1), which is the first exponent of the LE spectrum λi:(10)λi=1ΔN∑j=0N−1lnR(j)iiwhere Δ is the sampling time step, N the data samples, and R(j)iiis part of the QR decomposition of the Jacobian of the time series [36].In this study, the estimated instantaneous entropy measures refer to the inhomogeneous point-process approximate and sample entropy, AI and SI, respectively [38]. These measures have their foundation in the instantaneous phase space estimation, in which the distance between two points is calculated through Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) distance (i.e. the maximum value of the absolute difference between two cumulative distribution functions) between the two pdfs associated to these two points. The time-varying radius r(t) is instantaneously expressed asr(t)=0.2σμe(t)[38].Of note, this instantaneous assessment of complexity opens the possibility of analyzing the proposed measures also in terms of variability of their evolution along time – an idea which we refer to as our complexity variability framework[38]. Moreover, we have shown that the dynamical estimates AI and SI are not substantially affected by the type of noise underlying the complex system, thus ensuring truly instantaneous tracking of the complexity of the underlying dynamical system [38].All features were calculated instantaneously with a Δ=5ms temporal resolution. In order to build subject-specific feature vectors, for every subject and for evey feature X, we condensed the information about the time-varying dynamics of X through its medianX˜and its respective absolute deviationX˜˜across time. As an exploratory/preliminary step, for each feature, we evaluated between-group differences inX˜andX˜˜for every feature using bivariate non-parametric statistics (Mann–Whitney test) under the null hypothesis that the between-subject medians of the two groups are equal. Also, in order to investigate whether our instantaneous HRV estimates can provide additional within-disease information, we analyzed univariate associations between these estimates and a battery of clinical/neuropsychological tests within out PD sample (Soearman Rank correlation, see Section 2.2 for details).In order to investigate weather using heartbeat dynamics alone is able to aid in single-subject discrimination, we employed an automatic classification algorithm. Specifically, we chose the well-known SVM-based method of classification [34] due to its increasingly widespread use in biomedical literature. In this context, data gathered from each subject constitutes one multidimensional point in the feature space along with its label (healthy control/PD), and each feature constitutes a single dimension of this feature space. A multidimensional point was considered an outlier if z-scores associated to its dimensions were greater than 3. To assess the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the system, we adopted a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifier [34]. Specifically, we employed a nu-SVM (nu=0.5) with a radial basis kernel function with γ=n−1, where n=22 is equal to the number of features (see Table 1for a complete list). Within the LOO scheme, the training set was normalized by subtracting the median value and dividing by the MAD over each dimension. These values were then used to normalize the example belonging to the test set. During the LOO procedure, this normalization step was performed on each fold. Classification results are summarized as balanced recognition accuracy (i.e. average of sensitivity and specificity) [48]. Additionally, in order to explore the relative importance of all features in the classification problem, we employed a support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) procedure in a wrapper approach (RFE was performed on the training set of each fold and we computed the median rank for each feature over all folds). We specifically chose a recently developed nonlinear SVM-RFE which employes a radial basis function kernel and includes a correlation bias reduction strategy into the feature elimination procedure [41]. All analyses were performed using Matlab© (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) v8.4 and an additional toolbox for pattern recognition (LIBSVM [7]).
