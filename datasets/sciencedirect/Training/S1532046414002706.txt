Geographically distributed environmental factors influence the burden of diseases such as asthma. Our objective was to identify sparse environmental variables associated with asthma diagnosis gathered from a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset while controlling for spatial variation. An EHR dataset from the University of Wisconsin’s Family Medicine, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Departments was obtained for 199,220 patients aged 5–50years over a three-year period. Each patient’s home address was geocoded to one of 3456 geographic census block groups. Over one thousand block group variables were obtained from a commercial database. We developed a Sparse Spatial Environmental Analysis (SASEA). Using this method, the environmental variables were first dimensionally reduced with sparse principal component analysis. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling was then used to identify block group variables associated with asthma from sparse principal components. The addresses of patients from the EHR dataset were distributed throughout the majority of Wisconsin’s geography. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling captured spatial variation of asthma. Four sparse principal components identified via model selection consisted of food at home, dog ownership, household size, and disposable income variables. In rural areas, dog ownership and renter occupied housing units from significant sparse principal components were associated with asthma. Our main contribution is the incorporation of sparsity in spatial modeling. SASEA sequentially added sparse principal components to Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling. This method allowed association of geographically distributed environmental factors with asthma using EHR and environmental datasets. SASEA can be applied to other diseases with environmental risk factors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
While there is continued interest in associating genes with disease using methods such as genome-wide association studies [1], approximately 23% of disease burden and death can be attributed to environmental factors [2]. It is important to associate diseases with a strong environmental component, including respiratory infections, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and asthma [2], with geographical environmental factors. Methods that consider spatial variation and interpretability of results will increasingly be utilized as clinical, environmental, and geographical datasets become more readily available. Our paper applies sparsity with spatial modeling to study the association of environmental factors and asthma.Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and inflammation [3]. Its prevalence rose by 15% in the last 10years [4]. Based on a Wisconsin Department of Health Services asthma surveillance report, approximately 14% of adults and 10% of children have been diagnosed with asthma in Wisconsin [5]. In 2009, 5300 people were hospitalized and 21,000 went to an emergency department with a principal diagnosis of asthma. Eleven percent of adults with asthma had an emergency department visit and 20% had urgent care visits for symptoms [5].Asthma onset is associated with multiple, complex factors. While some are non-modifiable such as sex and age [6], many others are associated with the environment and residential location. These include educational attainment, household income, health insurance, smoking, physical activity, and obesity [6]. Medical conditions influenced by the environment and associated with asthma include atopy [7], allergic reactions [8], airway hyperreactivity [9], and airway responsiveness [10]. Over 370 outdoor and indoor environmental factors have been associated with asthma including substances from building materials, cleaning products, personal care products, central heating systems, maintenance, and humidification devices [11].Geographic information system (GIS) analyses have been used to study geographic environmental variables associated with asthma. The most studied variable was air pollution [12], which has been measured via passive measurement, direct measurement, proximity to roadways, and traffic carbon emissions. Besides air pollution, asthma was associated with climate differences [13], latitude [14], and socioeconomic status [15]. Socioeconomic status, specifically male employment, was positively associated with asthma in a Southern California study, where access to care and the hygiene hypothesis—the idea that limited exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens during childhood result in a predisposition to allergy [16,17]—were proposed as explanations.Fewer asthma studies have incorporated local environmental variables aggregated at the level of census tracts or block groups. Census tracts and block groups are geographic areas developed by the United State Census Bureau and contain 1500–8000 and 600–3000 people, respectively. Using census tract data, asthma diagnosis was correlated with houses facing highway intersection [18] and sociodemographic characteristics of race, sex, and education [19]. Fewer studies have used block group level variables. Socioeconomic status was associated with asthma diagnosis using block group level data [15]. Many of these analyses used questionnaire data to determine asthma diagnosis, which may be limited by self-report bias [20]. These analyses involved less than 5700 participants, 10 environmental variables, and census geographic regions from only a portion of a state.Environmental variables and built environments have been studied using EHR data. For example, nitrogen oxides were tested for association with diseases including asthma diagnoses obtained from EHR datasets in primary care [21]. Body mass index (BMI) calculated from EHR data was positively associated with the number of fast food restaurants near a person’s home [22].Schwartz et al. [23] used an EHR dataset, environmental community-level variables, and multilevel statistical analysis to demonstrate that lower BMI was associated with higher socioeconomic status and areas with more venues for physical activity.Spatial statistics offer methods to incorporate geographic location to identify risk factors associated with disease [24]. The spatial statistics utilized in this study included a generalized additive model. Generalized additive models [25] are generalized linear models with predictors that involve a linear sum of smooth functions.Previous health studies that utilized spatial generalized additive models investigated the association of air pollution and mortality, tuberculosis drug resistance patterns in Peru [26], and geographic distribution of heart disease [27].Spatial statistics, specifically additive models, have been combined with sparsity. COSSO [28] and SpAM [29] extended the lasso estimator [30] while another approach created a new sparsity-smoothness penalty [31].Our goal was to identify an interpretable set of environmental risk factors of asthma distributed geographically. Other studies have combined environmental variables and EHR data, spatial statistics and disease, and spatial statistics and sparsity. Our main contribution is the addition of sparsity to spatial statistics. As applied to geographically distributed EHR and environmental datasets, we describe this methodology as Sparse Spatial Environmental Analysis (SASEA).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Further analysis to determine the individual variables from sparse principal components that are associated with asthma could be performed using traditional methods such as stepwise model selection with BIC. This analysis could be performed with UW eHealth–PHINEX data from other years (e.g. 2009–2012), a UW eHealth–PHINEX hold out dataset, or a non-UW eHealth–PHINEX EHR dataset in another geographic region.There are many future directions for this work regarding diseases and methods. Our methods could be applied to asthma control, other chronic diseases, and different communities. The census block groups and ESRI environmental data are already available nationwide. It is foreseeable that with the integration of a national EHR dataset, this type of analysis will be utilized to identify spatial risk factors to allow investigation or evaluation of interventions in any geographic region [58].Alternative methods could have been used in this study. Traditional Logistic regression without the smoothing term does not account for the unknown orientation of spatial correlation among asthma due to geography, nor does it directly address difficulties in high dimensional data by constructing sparse models. Other spatial models included conditional auto-regressive models [59]. As the four sparse principal components accounted for a small percentage of variance from the original dataset, other methods such as traditional principal components analysis or clustering could have been utilized. However, traditional principal component analysis maintained all variables in each principal component preventing sparse interpretation, and clustering environmental variables added complexity. Few variables could have been associated more directly with the Logistic thin plate regression spline model using least absolute shrinkage and selector operator [30] such as COSSO [28]. However, a new set of variables would be identified for different diseases and variables could not be grouped. Allowing regression coefficients to vary over space as in geographically weighted regression [60] could be accomplished with spatial smoothing spline interaction terms.
