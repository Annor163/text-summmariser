@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The load from power station varies from time to time due to uncertain demand of consumers and is known as variable load on the station. A power station is designed to meet the load requirements of the consumers and to follow the quick nonlinearity of the load. An ideal load on the station, from stand point of equipment needed and operating routine, would be one of constant magnitude and steady duration. However, such a steady load on the station is never realized in actual practice. The consumers require their small or large block of power in accordance with the demand of their nonlinear activities. The load demand of one consumer at any time may be different from that consumer. The result is that load on the isolated wind power station varies nonlinearly from time to time [1].Electricity generation crisis and environmental pollution effect motivate to study the availability of green renewable power. Wind is available in most Arab countries, on an average of 1400h/year. The best wind power potential may be found in Egypt, Oman and Morocco where full load hours of appropriate wind reaches 2500h/year with a speed ranging from 8 to 11m/s [2]. For Egypt, the area of Suez Gulf is characterized with high average wind speed. Area from Ras Gharib north up to Elzyt Gulf has an excellent wind regime exceeding 10m/s which would host 3000–4000MW wind farms projects. The area in the west of Suez Gulf can host about 20,000 MW installed capacities of wind farms [3]. Because of the Egyptian electricity crisis, wind turbine based SEIG may be the first step to solve this problem, especially with respect to large areas that has suitable speed range for this technology [4]. For this purpose excessive study for the load nature should by taking into account like nonlinearity of loads with respect to time [5].The self-excited induction generator mathematical model has been proposed to study the transient and steady state of operation. The d–q axes stator–rotor current are the functions of machine parameters. The solution of such equation has been obtained assuming all parameters are nonlinear [6]. In this paper, the study has been made for an analysis of fixed pitch angle and different wind speed based SEIG and its dynamic behavior under nonlinear resistive load. The residual magnetization in the machine is taken into account in simulation process as it is necessarily required for the generator to self -excite. Initial voltage in the capacitor is considered as 10V for build-up of voltage for excitation of SEIG. The simulations have been carried out developing model in MATLAB/SIMULINK [7].Several researchers in recent years have presented many techniques aimed for studying the response of wind based SEIG under different situations. Study of Wind Turbine based SEIG under Balanced/Unbalanced Loads and Excitation; the main objective of the paper is the dynamic study of SEIG under balanced R-L/R-C loads, balanced and unbalanced excitation, and fixed pitch angle wind turbine model has been considered for driving induction generator [8]. Wind driven induction generator study with static and dynamic loads; the main objective of the paper is study the performance of SEIG under balanced/unbalanced excitation with balanced RLC and dynamic load [9]. The proposed technique study the performance of wind turbine based SEIG under nonlinear load variation and the behavior of the system. This paper is organized as follows. The mathematical modeling of SEIG, wind turbine, and the nonlinear resistive load are described in Section 2. In Section 3, the Simulink model of the system is under study. The simulation results are explained in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.This section include the d–q mathematical model of the self-excited induction generator, the wind mathematical model with fixed pitch angle turbine under different wind speed, and the nonlinear load model characteristics. The schematic diagram of the under testing standalone wind turbine based SEIG is shown in Fig. 1.The generated voltage in a self-excited induction generator grows and reaches a steady state value where the peak of the generated voltage remains at a constant peak value. Once steady state is attained a load can be connected to the SEIG. In a SEIG operating without load the stator current and the capacitor current are equal. However, in a loaded SEIG the stator current is divided into capacitor current and load current. With a good model and implementing the model using simulation software the dynamic characteristics of generated voltage, stator current, capacitor current, load current, magnetizing current, power, and electromagnetic torque can be studied with confidence. The standard model described in this paper utilizes the state space method, also known as the time domain approach, which provides a convenient, compact and robust way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs [4]. This state space model is expressed with respect to the stator reference frame (SRF), i.e. its coordinate system is stationary with respect to the stator and does not rotate [6].Fig. 2shows the d–q axes equivalent circuit of a SEIG supplying nonlinear resistive load. The mathematical model of an induction machine, obtained from Fig. 2, is presented by the following set of equations in the stationary α–β reference frame: The mathematical current Eqs. (1–7) is a classical matrix formulation using d–q axes model used to represent the dynamics of conventional induction machine operating as a generator. Using the capacitive voltage implemented by mathematical Eqs. (8–13) in such a matrix representation, one can obtain the instantaneous voltages. In such a matrix representation, one can obtain the instantaneous voltages and currents during the self-excitation process, as well as during load variations [10].For the rotor side of Fig. 2, the quadrature and the direct axis rotor (referred to stator) flux linkage is:(1)λqr=L1riqr+Lm(iqs+iqr)(2)λdr=L1ridr+Lm(ids+idr)The matrix equation for the d–q model of a self-excited induction generator, in the stationary stator reference frame, using the SEIG model given in Fig. 2 and from Eqs. (1) and (2), for no-load is given as:(3)[0000]=[Rs+pLs0pLm00Rs+pLs0pLmpLmωrLm−ωrLmpLmRr+pLr−ωrLrωrLrRr+pLr][iqsidsiqridr]+[VcqVcd−KqrKdr]And the capacitor voltages in Fig. 2 can be represented as:(4)Vcq=1c∫icqdt+Vcq|t=0(5)Vcd=1c∫icddt+Vcd|t=0whereVcq0=Vcq|t=0andVcd0=Vcd|t=0are the initial voltage along the q-axis and d-axis capacitors respectively and the constants Kdrand Kqrare due to the remnant or residual magnetic flux in the core.Using Matrix inversion, Eq. (3) can be written as:(6)pI=AI+Bwhere(7)A=1L[−Lrrs−Lm2ωrLmrr−LmωrLrLm2ωr−LsrsLmωrLrLmrrLmrsLsωrLm−LsrrLsωrLr−LsωrLmLmrs−LsωrLr−Lsrr]andL=LsLr−L2m(8)B=1L[LmKq−LrVcqLmKd−LrVcdLmVcq−LsKqLmVcd−LsKd](9)I=[iqsidsiqridr]For a nonlinear resistive load condition of SEIG, additional equations needed are:(10)icq=iqs+iqL(11)icd=ids+idL(12)iqL=VqsRL(13)idL=VdsRLThe SEIG operates in the saturation region and its magnetizing characteristics are non-linear in nature. Magnetizing current should be calculated in every step of integration in terms of stator and rotor d–q currents as defined by:(14)Im=(ids+idr)2+(iqs+iqr)2Magnetizing inductance is calculated from the magnetizing characteristics which can be obtained by synchronous speed test for the machine under test. This characteristic can be defined as:(15)Lm=0.1407+0.0014im−0.0012I2m+0.00005I3mDeveloped electromagnetic torque of the SEIG is:(16)Te=(32)(P2)Lm(iqsidr−idsiqr)The derivative of the rotor speed is:(17)pωr=(P2J)(Tt−Te)The residual magnetism in the machine is taken into account in simulation process as it is necessarily required for the generator to self-excite. Initial voltage in the capacitor is considered as 10 V for build-up of voltage for excitation for SEIG.Fixed pitch angle wind turbine model has been utilized to drive induction motor. The fixed pitch angle model of the wind turbine has been considered with number of blades as 3, blade radius equal to 13m, and the gear ratio is taken as 30 with fixed pitch angle as. Since the power coefficient characteristic of wind turbine is a non-linear curve that reflects the aerodynamic behavior a wind turbine. The characteristic forms the basis for(β=0). Since the power coefficient characteristic of wind turbine is a non-linear curve that reflects the aerodynamic behavior a wind turbine. The characteristic forms the basis for the custom turbine model. The non-linear, dimensionless Cp characteristic is represented as [11].(18)tipspeedratio(λ)=ωmRVm(19)Pt=0.5ρAV3m[0.5176e−21λ+0.735(116λ−9.06)+0.0068λ](20)Tt=PtωmThere is an increasing demand for more detailed and accurate modeling techniques for predicting the nonlinear response of power system loads. This is particularly so in relation to study the response of the wind turbine based SEIG as a helping step to solve the crisis of electricity generation in Egypt. The nonlinear resistive load characteristics are nonlinearity and asymmetry. The non-linearity rises according to the voltage–current characteristic curve of load is nonlinear [12]. For the wind turbine based SEIG model used in this paper, the voltage and current are 200  V and 8 A respectively, the nonlinear resistive load R(t) has periodic characteristic and used to present nonlinearity and asymmetry. The value of R(t) is obtained from the voltage and current characteristic during steady state as shown in Fig. 3. Seven points on the 1stst and 3rdrdquadrants respectively are chosen for linearization of the voltage/current characteristics. Moreover, one value of voltage maps to two values of current. In order to discriminate between the two values, the derivative of a voltage is used; the positive derivative of the voltage corresponds to the upper line on the 1ststquadrant and the negative derivative the lower line. If the voltage brought in the range ofvn<v(t)<vn+1, the corresponding current is obtained byin+in+1−invn+1−vn×(v(t)−vn),andthenR(t)is estimated by [13]:(21)R(t)=v(t)i(t)=v(t)in+in+1−invn+1−vn×(v(t)−vn)where n is the point number on the voltage–current characteristic curve.From Fig. 3 by taking each point Y-axis divided by the X-axis to evaluate the nonlinear resistive load as a function of time is shown in Fig. 4. It indicates the nonlinearity of the load condition that applied to the wind turbine based SEIG during 42s, to test the system response under this nonlinearity (as a model of consumer power demand).The load on a wind turbine based SEIG varies from time to time due to uncertain demand of the consumers and known as variable load on station. The proposed computer model of very short duration of load variation nonlinearity and the system response during this variation is studied.MATAB/SIMULINK is powerful software tool which needs modeling and simulating the isolated wind turbine based SEIG under nonlinear loads. The equations of self-excited induction generator (4poles,rs=1Ω,rr=0.77Ω,L1s=L1r=1mh,J=0.23Kg.m2,C=110μF,Kd=Kq=4,ρ=1.1Kg/m2,andVm=9−12m/s)described above have been implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The MATLAB SIMULINK model is shown in Fig. 5with subsystems component shown in color. Eqs. (4–13) show the eight first order differential equations, for which the solution gives the four SEIG currents (stator d–q axis currents and rotor d–q axis currents), load currents and capacitor voltages. Further these currents are the function of constants: stator and rotor inductances, resistances, speed, excitation capacitance and load impedance. And also variables like magnetizing inductance, magnetizing currents and electromagnetic torque generated, have been evaluated using equations described in the Section 2. The constraints of non-linear magnetizing inductance have been taken into account. The wind turbine is implemented in subsystem ‘wind turbine’ as shown in SIMULINK model of SEIG in Fig. 5 by using equations as described in Section 2.In this work, the results have been determined for isolated wind turbine based SEIG under nonlinear load. The system model and the dynamic response have been obtained using MATLAB 7.8 version. This model has been discussed in the previous section. The residual magnetism in the machine is taken into account in simulation process as it is necessarily required for the generator to self-excite. Initial voltage in the capacitor is considered as 10V for build-up of voltage for excitation of SEIG. The results of SEIG under nonlinear have been determined.The voltage in Fig. 6indicates that the average value of voltage is constant under 9m/s, the result of current under such case also seems to be constant as shown in Fig. 7although the load current quickly varied as shown in Fig. 8. The magnetization inductance and its current response considered to be as quick as the load demand indicated in Fig. 9. The electrical and the mechanical torque balance indicate that the system is balanced although the variation time is very small as shown in Fig. 10. All these variation occurred under constant win speed as in Fig. 11.The wind speed range used for this study is from cut-in speed to the maximum operation point, and results proved that the system is stable. Some results indicated here to prove the response as shown in the following figures. Fig. 12indicates that the phase voltage improved with respect to speed but the average variation of the other speed response is still considered constant. The phase current improved to 10A and the system is still stable as shown in Fig. 13, by the same way the load current increased to 9A as indicated in Fig. 14. The magnetization current improved to 13A with respect to speed and Fig. 15indicates that. Still the mechanical torque and the electrical torque are balanced under speed variation as shown in Fig. 16. The speed of wind turbine is still constant for the load speed variation that indicated from Fig. 17.The results indicate that the dynamic study of the wind turbine based SEIG under nonlinear resistive load with fixed pitch angle but variable wind speed has a good response. The average response is considered to be constant and reliable under such loading criteria. This means the isolated wind turbine based SEIG can be used instead of unified network with reliable, dependable, and fulfillment. Under sever load conditions the system is still sable and may be used as a step to solve this crises, especially for zones of wind availability. The following table is a comparison of the proposed study with respect to the previous studies (Table 1).
