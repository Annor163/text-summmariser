@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Real-world signals are often not band-limited, and in many cases of practical interest sampling points are not always measured regularly. The purpose of this paper is to propose an irregular sampling theorem for the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), which places no restrictions on the input signal. First, we construct frames for function spaces associated with the FRFT. Then, we introduce a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction in the function spaces. Based upon the proposed framework, an FRFT-based irregular sampling theorem without band-limiting constraints is established. The theoretical derivations are validated via numerical results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) [1,2] is a generalization of the Fourier transform (FT) with additional free angle parameters. It can be interpreted as a rotation by an angle α in the time-frequency plane [3]. The FRFT can extend the utilities of the FT and has received much attention in recent years due to its numerous applications [1–9], including quantum physics, optics, radar, communications, signal processing, etc.The FRFT of a functionf(t)∈L2(R)is defined as [2](1)Fα(u)=Fα{f(t)}(u)≜∫Rf(t)Kα(u,t)dtwhereFαdenotes the FRFT operator, and kernelKα(u,t)is given by(2)Kα(u,t)={Aαeju2+t22cot⁡αe−jtucsc⁡α,α≠kπδ(t−u),α=2kπδ(t+u),α=(2k−1)πwhereAα=(1−jcot⁡α)/2πandk∈Z. Conversely, the inverse FRFT with respect to angle α is the FRFT with angle −α. In general, we only consider the case of0<α<π, since (1) can easily be extended outside the interval(0,π)by noting thatF2πkis the identity operator for any integer k andFαhas the additivity propertyFα+β{f(t)}=Fα{Fβ{f(t)}}. Note that whenα=π/2, (1) reduces to the FT.Sampling theory plays a crucial role in signal processing and communications, which allows real-life signals in the continuous domain to be acquired, represented, and processed in the discrete domain. In the sense of the FRFT [10–21], the most classical sampling result is the theorem of Xia [10], which states that for a finite energyπsin⁡α-fractional band-limited signalf(t), i.e., signalf(t)∈L2(R)whose FRFT has support in[−πsin⁡α,πsin⁡α],(3)f(t)=∑n∈Zf[n]sinc(t−n)e−jt2−n22cot⁡αwheresinc(⋅)≜sin⁡π(⋅)/π(⋅), and a normalized sampling step is used. Mathematically, Xia's sampling procedure is equivalent to computing the orthogonal projection of the input signalf(t)on to the spaceBα=span¯{sinc(t−n)e−jt2−n22cot⁡α}n∈Zof fractional band-limited signals. Unfortunately, the procedure is not appropriate for non-bandlimited signals. However, if we substituteϕ(t)forsinc(t)in the spaceBα, thenBαis exactly the function space associated with the FRFT [22], i.e.,(4)Vα(ϕ)=span¯{ϕn,α(t)≜ϕ(t−n)e−jt2−n22cot⁡α}n∈Z⊂L2(R).Realizing this property, Shi et al. [22] extended (3) to spaceVα(ϕ). Specifically, letϕ(t)be a continuous function inL2(R)such that{ϕn,α(t)}n∈Zis a Riesz basis for spaceVα(ϕ)and{ϕ[n]}n∈Zbelongs toℓ2(Z). There exists a functions(t)∈L2(R)withs(t)e−jt22cot⁡α∈Vα(ϕ)such that [22](5)f(t)=∑n∈Zf[n]s(t−n)e−jt2−n22cot⁡αholds inL2(R)for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ)if and only if12πΦ˜(ucsc⁡α)∈L2[0,2πsin⁡α]holds, whereΦ˜(ucsc⁡α)denotes the discrete-time FT (with its argument scaled bycsc⁡α) ofϕ[n]. It is clear that (5) applies only to the case of regular sampling. In many real applications, sampling points are not always measured regularly. Sometimes sampling steps need to be fluctuated according to input signals so as to reduce the number of samples as well as computational complexity. There are also many cases where undesirable jitter exists in sampling instants. Some communication systems may suffer from random delay due to channel traffic congestion and encoding delay. In such cases, the sampling system will become more efficient when a perturbation factor is considered. Towards this end, Zhao et al. [23] introduced an extension of Paley–Wiener's14-Theorem based upon the linear canonical transform, which is a generalization of the FRFT. However, the extension is appropriate to the case of band-limited signals only. Therefore, it is desirable to derive an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT without band-limiting constraints. The purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the theory of frames. We first construct frames for function spaces associated with the FRFT, and then propose a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction in the function spaces. Further, without band-limited assumption, we establish an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT. Numerical results are also presented.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, notation is introduced, and some facts of the frame theory and the discrete-time FRFT are briefly reviewed. In Section 3, a unified framework for FRFT-based sampling and reconstruction in function spaces is proposed. Then, an irregular sampling theorem of the FRFT without band-limiting constraints is established in Section 4. In Section 5, numerical results are given. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 6.Continuous signals are denoted with parentheses, e.g.,f(t),t∈R, and discrete signals with brackets, e.g.,q[n],n∈Z. The scalar product of two functionsf(t)andg(t)inL2(R)is defined as〈f,g〉=∫Rf(t)g⁎(t)dt, where ⁎ in the superscript denotes the complex conjugate. The norm of a functionf(t)∈L2(R)is defined as‖f‖=〈f,f〉1/2. For a measurable functiong(t)onR, let‖g‖∞=esssup|g(t)|and‖g‖0=essinf|f(t)|be the essential supremum and infimum of|g(t)|, respectively. The characteristic function of a measurable subsetE⊂Ris denoted withχE(t), whereχE(t)=1,t∈E, and 0 otherwise.A function sequence{φn(t)}n∈Zin a Hilbert spaceHis said to be a frame if there exists a constantC≥1such that(6)C−1‖f‖2≤∑n∈Z|〈f(t),φn(t)〉|2≤C‖f‖2holds for anyf(t)∈H. If the removal of one elementφm(t)renders the function sequence{φn(t)}n≠mno longer a flame, then it is called an exact frame. An exact frame is a Riesz basis. Obviously, a Riesz basis is also a frame [24]. For any frame{φn(t)}n∈ZofH, there exists a so-called dual frame{φ˜n(t)}n∈Z⊂Hsuch that(7)f(t)=∑n∈Z〈f(t),φ˜n(t)〉φn(t)=∑n∈Z〈f(t),φn(t)〉φ˜n(t)holds inL2(R)for anyf(t)∈H. Take a linear operator T onHdefined as(8)T{f(t)}=∑n∈Z〈f(t),φn(t)〉φn(t).Then,〈T{f(t)},f(t)〉=∑n∈Z|〈f(t),φn(t)〉|2. Eq. (6) implies that the operator T is bounded, self-conjugate, and invertible. It is easy to see that the function sequenceT−1{φn(t)}n∈Zis a dual frame of frame{φn(t)}n∈Z, and T is called a frame transform of{φn(t)}n∈Z. The scalar sequence{〈f(t),φn(t)〉}n∈Zis called a moment sequence off(t)to frame{φn(t)}n∈Z. Letf(t)=∑n∈Zcnφn(t). If{cn}n∈Zis a moment sequence of a function to{φn(t)}n∈Z, then it must be(9)cn=〈T−1{f(t)},φn(t)〉,∀n∈Z.This follows from the fact thatcn=〈h,φn(t)〉for some functionh(t)∈H, andT−1{f(t)}=∑n∈Z〈h(t),φn(t)〉T−1{φn(t)}=h(t)inL2(R).There are two different definitions [12,25] for the discrete-time FRFT (DTFRFT) in the literature. We adopt the one introduced in [12], which has a simple structure. The DTFRFT of a sequence{q[n]}n∈Zis defined as [12](10)Q˜α(u)=∑n∈Zq[n]Kα(u,n).Note that if{q[n]}n∈Z∈ℓ2(Z),Q˜α(u)∈L2[0,2πsin⁡α]. Conversely, the inverse DTFRFT is given byq[n]=∫IQ˜α(u)Kα⁎(u,n)du, whereI≜[0,2πsin⁡α]. The DTFRFT has the following chirp-periodicity [22]:(11)Q˜α(u+2πsin⁡α)e−j(u+2πsin⁡α)22cot⁡α=Q˜α(u)e−ju22cot⁡α.For a continuous-time functionϕ(t)∈L2(R), define(12)Gϕ,α(u)≜∑k∈Z|Φ(ucsc⁡α+2kπ)|2whereΦ(ucsc⁡α)denotes the FT (with its argument scaled bycsc⁡α) ofϕ(t). Generally speaking, the function sequence{ϕn,α(t)}n∈Zwith the form defined in (4) is not a Riesz basis forVα(ϕ). In fact, it is a Riesz basis forVα(ϕ)if and only if [21,22](13)0≤‖Gϕ,α(u)‖0≤‖Gϕ,α(u)‖∞<∞.In this case,ϕ(t)is said to be a stable generator forVα(ϕ). Moreover, the function sequence{ϕn,α(t)}n∈Zis an orthonormal basis ofVα(ϕ)if and only ifGϕ,α(u)=1holds for almost everywhereu∈R. In particular, if we chooseϕ(t)=sinc(t), the stable spaceVα(sinc)is exactly the space of allπsin⁡α-fractional band-limited signals with finite energy. Sampling inVα(sinc)leads to Xia's sampling theorem of the FRFT for regularly sampled signals [10]. In this paper, we will present an irregular sampling theorem of the FRFT inVα(ϕ)for a general stable generatorϕ(t). We also needϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2. For anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), it follows from (4) that(14)f(t)=∑m∈Zc[m]ϕ(t−m)e−jt2−m22cot⁡αwhere{c[m]}m∈Z∈ℓ2(Z). It is easy to see that(15)|∑m∈Zc[m]ϕ(t−m)e−jt2−m22cot⁡α|2≤∑m∈Z|c[m]|2∑m∈Z|ϕ(t−m)|2which implies that the series defined in (14) point-wise converges to a continuous function inVα(ϕ). Without loss of generality, we can take anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ)as a continuous function.Based on the above facts, we start by constructing frames for the spaceVα(ϕ), and then propose a unified framework for sampling and reconstruction inVα(ϕ)for the FRFT. We will also show how the unified framework can be used to design FRFT-based irregular sampling inVα(ϕ)in Section 4.Theorem 1Suppose thatϕ(t)is a continuous stable generator of the spaceVα(ϕ)such thatϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2. Then, there exists a functionsn(t)∈L2(R)such that the function sequence(16){sn,α(t)≜sn(t)e−jt2−tn22cot⁡α}n∈Zis a frame of spaceVα(ϕ), and the scalar sequence{f[tn]}n∈Zis a moment sequence to frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Z, andf(t)=∑n∈Zf[tn]sn,α(t)holds inL2(R)for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ)if and only if there exists a constantC≥1such that(17)C−1‖f(t)‖2≤∑n∈Z|f[tn]|2≤C‖f(t)‖2holds for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ).Sufficiency: SinceGϕ,α−1(u)∈L2[0,2πsin⁡α]is a2πsin⁡α-periodic function in the FRFT domain, it follows from [22] that there exists a scalar sequence{d[n]}n∈Z∈ℓ2(Z)such that(18)1Gϕ,α(u)=∑n∈Zd[n]ejn22cot⁡α−jnucsc⁡αinL2(R). Then, we can define a functionψ(t)∈L2(R)as(19)Ψ(ucsc⁡α)≜Φ(ucsc⁡α)Gϕ,α(u)whereΨ(ucsc⁡α)denotes the FT (with its argument scaled bycsc⁡α) ofψ(t). Applying the relationship between the FRFT and FT [11], in conjunction with (18) and (19), gives rise to(20)Fα{ψ(t)e−jt22cot⁡α}(u)=2πAαeju22cot⁡αΨ(ucsc⁡α)=2πΦ(ucsc⁡α)∑n∈Zd[n]Kα(u,n)=2πD˜α(u)Φ(ucsc⁡α)whereD˜α(u)indicates the DTFRFT ofd[n]. Then, taking the inverse FRFTs of both sides of (20) leads to(21)ψ(t)e−jt22cot⁡α=∑n∈Zd[n]ϕ(t−n)e−jt2−n22cot⁡αwhich implies that the functionψ(t)e−jt22cot⁡α∈Vα(ϕ), and therefore, it can be chosen to be continuous due to the factϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2. Moreover, the summation in (21) pointwise holds. Next, giventn∈R, using Parseval's identity of the discrete-time FT [1] and combining (21) and (18) results in(22)∑k∈Z|ψ[tn−k]e−jtn2−k22cot⁡α|2=∑k∈Z|ψ[tn−k]|2=‖∑k∈Zψ[tn−k]ejkucsc⁡α‖2=‖∑k∈Zϕ[tn−k−l]ej(k+l)ucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u)‖2≤‖∑k∈Zϕ[tn−k−l]ej(k+l)ucsc⁡α‖2‖Gϕ,α2(u)‖∞=∑k′∈Z|ϕ[tn−k′]|2‖Gϕ,α2(u)‖∞where the index transformk+l=k′is used. The factϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2shows that{ψ[tn−k]e−jtn2−k22cot⁡α}k∈Zbelongs toℓ2(Z). In this case, we can define(23)qϕ,α(tn,t)≜∑k∈Z(ψ[tn−k]e−jtn2−k22cot⁡α)⁎ϕ(t−k)e−jt2−k22cot⁡α=∑k∈Zψ⁎[tn−k]ϕ(t−k)e−jt2−tn22cot⁡α.It follows from (15) thatqϕ,α(tn,t)is continuous inVα(ϕ). Next, taking the FRFTs of both sides of (14) yields(24)Fα{f(t)}(u)=2πC˜α(u)Φ(ucsc⁡α)whereC˜α(u)denotes the DTFRFT ofc[n]. Also, taking the FRFTs of both sides of (23) and combining (21) and (18) gives rise to(25)Fα{qϕ,α(tn,t)}(u)=2πAαejtn22cot⁡α+ju22cot⁡α∑k∈Zψ⁎[tn−k]e−jkucsc⁡α12π∫Rϕ(t−k)e−j(t−k)ucsc⁡αdt=2πAαΦ(ucsc⁡α)ejtn22cot⁡α+ju22cot⁡α∑l∈Zd⁎[l]e−jl22cot⁡α+jlucsc⁡α∑k∈Zϕ⁎[tn−k−l]e−j(k+l)ucsc⁡α=2πΦ(ucsc⁡α)Kα(u,tn)Gϕ,α(u)∑k′∈Zϕ⁎[tn−k′]ej(tn−k′)ucsc⁡α.From Parseval's identity of the FRFT [2], in conjunction with (24), (25), and (14), it follows that(26)〈f(t),qϕ,α(tn,t)〉=〈Fα{f(t)}(u),Fα{qϕ,α(tn,t)}(u)〉=∑m∈Zc[m]ϕ[tn−m]e−jtn2−m22cot⁡α=f[tn].By combining (26) and (17), we arrive at(27)C−1‖f(t)‖2≤∑n∈Z|〈f(t),qϕ,α(tn,t)〉|2≤C‖f(t)‖2which implies that the function sequence{qϕ,α(tn,t)}n∈Zforms a frame forVα(ϕ). The theory of frames [24] asserts the existence of a dual frame. Specifically, for any frame ofVα(ϕ)with the form defined in (23), there exists a unique functionsn(t)∈L2(R)such that the function sequence{sn,α(t)}n∈Zdefined in (16) is also a frame forVα(ϕ). More specifically, letTqbe the frame transform of frame{qϕ,α(tn,t)}n∈Z. For anyn∈Z, take(28)sn,α(t)=Tq−1{qϕ,α(tn,t)}.Then, the function sequence{sn,α(t)}n∈Zis a dual frame of{qϕ,α(tn,t)}n∈ZinVα(ϕ). Consequently, (7) implies that(29)f(t)=∑n∈Z〈f(t),qϕ,α(tn,t)〉sn,α(t)holds inL2(R)for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ). Moreover, for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), the sequence{f[tn]}n∈Zis a moment sequence to frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Zdue to(30)f[tn]=〈f(t),Tq{sn,α(t)}〉=〈Tq{f(t)},sn,α(t)〉.Necessity: On the contrary, suppose that there exists a functionsn(t)∈L2(R)such that{sn,α(t)}n∈Zdefined in (16) is a frame ofVα(ϕ), and{f[tn]}n∈Zis a moment sequence to frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Zsuch that (29) holds inL2(R)for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), then (9) implies that(31)f[tn]=〈Ts−1{f(t)},sn,α(t)〉whereTsis the frame transform of frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Z. Therefore, it can be concluded that(32)∑n∈Z|f[tn]|2=∑n∈Z|〈Ts−1{f(t)},sn,α(t)〉|2≤C‖Ts−1{f(t)}‖2≤C2‖f(t)‖2and(33)∑n∈Z|f[tn]|2=∑n∈Z|〈Ts−1{f(t)},sn,α(t)〉|2≥C−1‖Ts−1{f(t)}‖2≥C−2‖f(t)‖2hold for some constantC≥1. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. □In practical applications, there are always errors, for instance due to imperfect clock, so called jitter errors, etc. This leads to irregular sampling, i.e.,tn=n+rn,rn∈(−1,1)for anyn∈Z. Moreover, there are numerous real-world applications in which analogy signals cannot be sampled regularly and the data are known only on an irregularly spaced sampling set. In communication systems, when data from a regularly sampled signal are lost, it generally results in a sequence of irregular samples [26–28]. There are also applications which can benefit from introducing irregular sampling, e.g., quantization methods [29]. In all of these examples, standard reconstruction techniques developed mainly for regularly spaced samples are not applicable.In order to derive an irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT, we need to introduce a function classΞλ[a,b](λ>0,0∈[a,b]⊂[−1,1]).Definition 1A functionf(t)∈Ξλ[a,b](λ>0,0∈[a,b]⊂[−1,1])if there is a constantCf>0such that for any{rn}n∈Z⊂[a,b],∑n∈Z|f[n+rn]−f[n]|≤Cfsupn∈Z⁡|rn|λ. The norm of a functionf(t)∈Ξλ[a,b]is expressed as‖f(t)‖Ξλ[a,b]=sup{rn}n∈Z⊂[a,b]⁡∑n∈Z|f[n+rn]−f[n]|supn∈Z⁡|rn|λ<∞.Iff(t)is differentiable on the intervalsn+[a,b](0∈[a,b]⊂[−1,1])for anyn∈Zand∑n∈Zsupt∈[a,b]⁡|f′(t+n)|<∞, thenf(t)∈Ξ1[a,b]due to(34)∑n∈Z|f[n+rn]−f[n]|=∑n∈Z|∫0rnf′(n+t)dt|≤∑n∈Z∫0supn∈Z⁡rn|f′(n+t)|dt≤supn∈Z⁡|rn|∑n∈Zsupt∈[a,b]⁡|f′(n+t)|wheref′(t)is the derivative off(t). Based on the above facts, we present the following irregular sampling theorem for the FRFT.Theorem 2Letϕ(t)be a continuous stable generator of the spaceVα(ϕ)such thatϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2, and(i)0<‖Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖0≤‖Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖∞<∞;ϕ(t)∈Ξλ[a,b].Lettk=k+rk. By Theorem 1, we only need to show that for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), there exists a constantC≥1such thatC−1‖f(t)‖2≤∑k∈Z|f[tk]|2≤C‖f(t)‖2. If we can show that there exists a positive numberη<1such that(37)∑k∈Z|f[tk]−f[k]|2≤η2∑k∈Z|f[k]|2holds for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), then(38)(1−η)2∑k∈Z|f[k]|2≤∑k∈Z|f[tk]|2≤(1+η)2∑k∈Z|f[k]|2.Next, for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), by applying Parseval's identity of the FRFT [2], (24), and (11), we arrive at(39)‖f(t)‖2=2π∑k∈Z∫I|Φ(ucsc⁡α+2kπ)|2|C˜α(u)|2du=2π∫IGϕ,α(u)|C˜α(u)|2du=2π‖Gϕ,α12(u)C˜α(u)‖2.Moreover, from (14), we letf[k]=∑m∈Zc[m]ϕ[k−m]e−jk2−m22cot⁡α. Since{c[m]}m∈Z∈ℓ2(Z)andϕ(t)=O((1+|t|)−ϵ)for someϵ>1/2,f[k]is well defined. Then, the DTFRFTF˜α(u)off[k]can be derived as(40)F˜α(u)=2πC˜α(u)Φ˜(ucsc⁡α).Combining (40) and Parseval's identity of the DTFRFT [22] gives rise to(41)∑k∈Z|f[k]|2=2π∫I|C˜α(u)Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)|2du.Lettingtk=kin (17), it follows from (41), (39), and (13) that(42)C−1‖f(t)‖2≤∑k∈Z|f[k]|2≤C‖f(t)‖2for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ)is equivalent to(43)C−1‖Gϕ,α12(u)‖0≤|Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)|≤C‖Gϕ,α12(u)‖∞.Then, statement (i) implies that there exists a constantC≥1such that (42) holds for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ). From (38) and (42), one can see that for anyf(t)∈Vα(ϕ),(44)C−1(1−η)2‖f(t)‖2≤∑k∈Z|f[tk]|2≤C(1+η)2‖f(t)‖2from which, in conjunction with Theorem 1, Theorem 2 can be shown.All that remains to be verified is (37). For anf(t)∈Vα(ϕ), it follows from (4) that there exists a sequence{c[k]}k∈Z∈ℓ2(Z)such thatf(t)=∑k∈Zc[k]ϕk,α(t)holds both inL2(R)and pointwise. Then, we can derive(45)∑k∈Z|f[tk]−f[k]|2=∑l,l′∈Zξll′c[l]c⁎[l′]whereξll′≜∑k∈Z(ϕl,α[tk]−ϕl,α[k])(ϕl′,α⁎[tk]−ϕl′,α⁎[k]). One can clearly see thatξll′=ξl′l⁎holds for anyl,l′∈Z. Thus, it follows that(46)∑k∈Z|f[tk]−f[k]|2≤∑l,l′∈Z|ξll′||c[l]|2+|c[l′]|22=12∑l∈Z(∑l′∈Z|ξll′|)|c[l]|2+12∑l′∈Z(∑l∈Z|ξll′|)|c[l′]|2=∑l∈Z(∑l′∈Z|ξll′|)|c[l]|2≤(supl∈Z⁡∑l′∈Z|ξll′|)∑l∈Z|c[l]|2.Further, applying (4) and Definition 1 gives rise to(47)supl∈Z⁡∑l′∈Z|ξll′|≤supl∈Z⁡∑l′,k∈Z|(ϕl,α[tk]−ϕl,α[k])(ϕl′,α⁎[tk]−ϕl′,α⁎[k])|≤supl∈Z⁡∑l′,k∈Z|(ϕ[rk+k−l]−ϕ[k−l])(ϕ⁎[rk+k−l′]−ϕ⁎[k−l′])|≤supl∈Z⁡∑m∈Z|(ϕ[rm+l+m]−ϕ[m])|∑n∈Z|(ϕ⁎[rm+l+n]−ϕ⁎[n])|≤(‖ϕ(t)‖Ξλ[a,b]supm∈Z⁡|rm|λ)2where the index substitutionsk−l=mandk−l′=nare used. Then, by combining (46) and (47), we have(48)∑k∈Z|f[tk]−f[k]|2≤(‖ϕ(t)‖Ξλ[a,b]supm∈Z⁡|rm|λ)2∑l∈Z|c[l]|2.Moreover, using (41) and Parseval's identity of the DTFRFT [22] yields(49)∑k∈Z|f[k]|2=2π∫I|Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)C˜α(u)|2du≥2π‖Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖02∫I|C˜α(u)|2du=‖2πΦ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖02∑k∈Z|c[k]|2.Therefore, from (37), (48), and (49), we only need to show(50)(‖ϕ(t)‖Ξλ[a,b]supm∈Z⁡|rm|λ)2∑l∈Z|c[l]|2≤η2‖2πΦ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖02∑k∈Z|c[k]|2which is exactly implied by (36). This completes the proof of Theorem 2. □In real-world applications, we often need to know the expression of the reconstruction frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Zin (35). SinceTqis the frame transform of frame{qϕ,α(tn,t)}n∈Z, using Parseval's identity of the FRFT [2], in conjunction with (25) and (8), results in(51)Tq{qϕ,α(tn,t)}=∑m∈Z〈qϕ,α(tn,t),qϕ,α(tm,t)〉qϕ,α(tm,t)=∑m∈Z〈Fα{qϕ,α(tn,t)}(u),Fα{qϕ,α(tm,t)}(u)〉qϕ,α(tm,t)=∑m∈Zqϕ,α(tm,t)ejtn2−tm22cot⁡α∫I∑k′∈Zϕ⁎[tn−k′]e−jk′ucsc⁡α∑k′∈Zϕ[tm−k′]ejk′ucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u)ducsc⁡α.For simplicity, we define(52)Anm≜∫I∑k′∈Zϕ⁎[tn−k′]e−jk′ucsc⁡α∑k′∈Zϕ[tm−k′]ejk′ucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u)ducsc⁡α.Then, lettingtn=n+rn,n∈Z, it follows that(53)Anm=∫I∑l∈Zϕ[l+rm]e−jlucsc⁡α∑l∈Zϕ⁎[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u)ej(m−n)ucsc⁡αducsc⁡αwhere the index substitutionsn−k′=landm−k′=lare used. Therefore, (51) can be rewritten as(54)Tq{qϕ,α(tn,t)}=∑m∈ZAnmqϕ,α(tm,t)ejtn2−tm22cot⁡αfrom which, in conjunction with (28), it follows that(55)qϕ,α(tn,t)=∑m∈ZAnmsm,α(t)ejtn2−tm22cot⁡α.Next, settingn−m=kin (53) results in(56)An(n+k)=∫I∑l∈Zϕ⁎[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡α∑l∈Zϕ[l+rn+k]e−jlucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u)ejkucsc⁡αducsc⁡α.DefineBnk(u)≜∑l∈Zϕ⁎[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡α∑l∈Zϕ[l+rn+k]e−jlucsc⁡αGϕ,α(u). Then, it follows thatAn(n+k)=∫IBnk(u)ejkucsc⁡αducsc⁡αand(57)∑m∈ZAnmejmucsc⁡α=∑k∈ZAn(n+k)ej(n+k)ucsc⁡α=ejnucsc⁡α∑k∈Zejkucsc⁡α∫IBnk(u)ejkucsc⁡αducsc⁡α.Also, define(58)En≜∑k∈Zejkucsc⁡α∫IBnk(u)ejkucsc⁡αducsc⁡α.SinceTqis a frame transform, the infinite-dimensional matrixA=(Anm)is invertible. It follows from (57) that{En}n∈Zare the eigenvalues of the matrixA=(Anm). Then, we denote byA−1=(En−1δn−m)the inverse matrix of A. From (55), we obtain(59)sn,α(t)=∑m∈ZEn−1δn−mqϕ,α(tm,t)e−jtn2−tm22cot⁡α=En−1qϕ,α(tn,t).Taking the FRFTs of both sides of (59) and using (25) results in(60)Fα{sn,α(t)}(u)=En−1Fα{qϕ,α(tn,t)}(u)=2πΦ(ucsc⁡α)Kα(u,tn)EnGϕ,α(u)∑k′∈Zϕ⁎[tn−k′]ej(tn−k′)ucsc⁡α.Also, taking the FRFTs of both sides of (16) gives rise toFα{sn,α(t)}(u)=2πKα(u,tn)ejtnucsc⁡αSn(ucsc⁡α). Therefore, it follows from (60) that(61)Sn(ucsc⁡α)=∑l∈Zϕ⁎[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡αEnGϕ,α(u)Φ(ucsc⁡α)e−jnucsc⁡αwhich determines the reconstruction frame{sn,α(t)}n∈Z.It was shown [10–21] that regular sampling of fractional band-limited signals is a hot topic of many recent studies. However, in many cases of practical interest sampling points{tn}n∈Zare not equidistant. The extension [23] of Paley-Wiener's14-Theorem in the generalized FRFT domain states that if{tn}n∈Zis a symmetric sequence (tn=−t−n) of real numbers such thatsupn∈Z⁡|tn−n|<14, then anyπsin⁡α-fractional band-limited signalf(t)can be reconstructed from its values at the points{tn}n∈Z, i.e.,(62)f(t)=e−jt22cot⁡α∑n∈Zf[tn]ejtn22cot⁡αG(t)(t−tn)G′(tn)whereG(t)=(t−t0)∏n=1∞(1−ttn)(1−tt−n). Specially, whent0=0,tn=n+c2/nwith|c|<1/2, forn≠0,G(t)=(t/2)(cos⁡(π(t2−4c2)1/2)−cos⁡(πt))sinh⁡(πc). But, sampling with the symmetricity constraint is restrictive in real-world applications. Fortunately, we can reconstructf(t)using (35) without the symmetricity constraint. Our objective is then to choose a generatorϕ(t)forVα(ϕ). For instance, we letϕ(t)=β3(t), the cubic spline [30]. It follows from [22] thatϕ(t)is a stable generator withΦ(ucsc⁡α)=12πsinc4(ucsc⁡α2π)andΦ˜(ucsc⁡α)=162π(e−jucsc⁡α+4e−j2ucsc⁡α+e−j3ucsc⁡α). Therefore,|Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)|=232π(cos⁡(ucsc⁡α)+2)that shows‖Φ˜(ucsc⁡α)‖0≥232π. Since‖ϕ(t)‖Ξ1[−12,12]=5324, it follows thatrϕ<1653. From (58), we haveEn=∑k∈Zejkucsc⁡α∫I∑l=03β3[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡α∑l=03β3[l+rn+k]e−jlucsc⁡αGϕ,α−1(u)ejkucsc⁡αducsc⁡α. Then, from (61), we arrive at(63)Sn(ucsc⁡α)=2π∑l=03β3[l+rn]ejlucsc⁡αEn∑k∈Z|sinc4(ucsc⁡α2π+k)|2sinc4(ucsc⁡α2π)2πe−jnucsc⁡α.Taking the inverse FT ofSn(ucsc⁡α)leads tosn(t)so that the reconstruction framesn,α(t)in (35) can be established. For the purpose of illustration, we observe a signal given byf(t)=2e−jt22sinc(t). It isπsin⁡α-fractional band-limited with angleα=π/4. The original signalf(t)and its corresponding irregular samples without the symmetricity constraint (tn=−t−n,n∈Z) are shown in Fig. 1.Now, we try to reconstructf(t),t∈[−10,10]using (35) against (62) under the condition that the number of sampling points is constrained to 19. The original and reconstructed signals are plotted in Fig. 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the experimental results clearly demonstrate that without the symmetricity constraint, the proposed method of sampling and reconstruction clearly outperforms the existing one given by (62). The normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of the proposed method is3.3×10−3, where the NMSE is defined asNMSE=‖fˆ(t)−f(t)‖2‖f(t)‖2, andfˆ(t)denotes the recovered signal. By comparison, when using (62), the NMSE is 0.8143.
