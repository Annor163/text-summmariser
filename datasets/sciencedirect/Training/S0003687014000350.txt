@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Facilitating physical activity during the workday may help desk-bound workers reduce risks associated with sedentary behavior. We 1) evaluated the efficacy of a cycling workstation to increase energy expenditure while performing a typing task and 2) fabricated a power measurement system to determine the accuracy and reliability of an exercise cycle. Ten individuals performed 10 min trials of sitting while typing (SITtype) and pedaling while typing (PEDtype). Expired gases were recorded and typing performance was assessed. Metabolic cost during PEDtype was ∼2.5× greater compared to SITtype (255 ± 14 vs. 100 ± 11 kcal h−1, P < 0.01). Typing time and number of typing errors did not differ between PEDtype and SITtype (7.7 ± 1.5 vs. 7.6 ± 1.6 min, P = 0.51, 3.3 ± 4.6 vs. 3.8 ± 2.7 errors, P = 0.80). The exercise cycle overestimated power by 14–138% compared to actual power but actual power was reliable (r = 0.998, P < 0.01). A cycling workstation can facilitate physical activity without compromising typing performance. The exercise cycle's inaccuracy could be misleading to users.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thirty-five percent of adults in the United States are currently obese and at increased risk of developing several metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological disorders (Haskell et al., 2007; Mutrie, 2001). Health care costs attributed to obesity are approximated to be $147 billion per year in the United States and those costs are predicted to increase to $200 billion per year over the next two decades (Finkelstein et al., 2009). Obesity results from a long-term excess of energy consumed vs. energy expended, a positive energy balance (Church et al., 2011). While overeating certainly contributes to a positive energy balance, the epidemic of obesity and related metabolic disorders is also driven by reductions in energy expended (Ford et al., 2012). With increased use of computers, office workers may remain seated and sedentary (Barnes et al., 2012) during which energy expenditure is minimal, making many offices obesogenic environments (Mummery et al., 2005). Sedentary behavior not only contributes to positive energy balance but is also an independent risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (Wilmot et al., 2012). Therefore, increasing physical activity and/or decreasing sedentary time are paramount to reducing obesity and associated disorders. However, traditional strategies to increase physical activity are compromised by insufficient time for exercise, perception that exercise is boring, concern about appearance during exercise, and fatigue after the workday (Mayo Clinic, 2011). These barriers could be reduced by facilitating physical activity during working hours.Treadmill workstations have been promoted as means to increase physical activity during working hours. John et al. (2011) reported that office workers, provided with a treadmill workstation for nine months, increased their walking time by 38–75 min day−1, compared to baseline, and averaged a walking speed of 1.5 mph. This duration and speed suggests an energy expenditure of approximately 100–200 kcal day−1, above baseline (Levine and Miller, 2007). Compared to baseline, the participants in this study exhibited significant decreases in waist and hip circumference as well as improvements in blood lipids and cholesterol. Similarly, Koepp et al. (2013) recently reported that office workers who were provided with a treadmill workstation for one year increased physical activity and decreased weight, while maintaining productivity (Koepp et al., 2013). This finding of unchanged productivity is important because other authors have reported that use of a treadmill workstation may compromise computer use accuracy (Funk et al., 2012; John et al., 2009) and/or work productivity (Thompson and Levine, 2011). A potential limitation of treadmill workstation use is that individuals who are overweight and obese are at increased risk for knee osteoarthritis (Felson et al., 1988) and thus may have limited ability to walk.As a non-weight bearing activity, cycling could serve as an alternative modality for facilitating increased physical activity in desk-bound office workers. Indeed, Straker et al. (2009) evaluated the effects of a cycling workstation (computer desk and an upright exercise cycle) on physiological responses and computer operation in office workers. Specifically, these authors reported that heart rate values increased by ∼25% when pedaling and typing compared to normal sitting and typing. Additionally, these authors reported that typing performance while cycling was slightly compromised but was better than typing performance during treadmill walking. To the best of our knowledge, no previous authors have reported the actual rate of energy expenditure that individuals might self-select for pedaling during an office task such as typing. It is also important to note that the previous cycling workstation design used by Straker et al. (2009) consisted of an upright exercise cycle with a relatively small seat. This design may present some ergonomic challenges, especially when using it for extended durations, as several participants in that study (9 out of 30) reported some form of hip or gluteal discomfort related to the exercise cycle seat. Further, such bicycle seats are known to reduce penile oxygen pressure, reflecting perineal compression (Schwarzer et al., 2002) and prolonged sitting on such seats can lead to perineal numbness and erectile dysfunction (Dettori et al., 2004). Thus, a cycling workstation with a recumbent seat position that is more similar to a standard office chair may facilitate prolonged activity without risks associated with upright cycling.Our primary purposes for conducting this investigation were to 1) determine the metabolic cost associated with self-selected pedaling intensity while performing a standardized typing task and 2) assess the influence of pedaling on typing performance (typing time and number of typing errors). These responses were compared to those associated with normal sitting while typing. We hypothesized that compared to sitting while typing, pedaling while typing would increase metabolic cost without compromising typing performance. Additionally, because the accuracy and reliability of commercial exercise cycles to quantify power are not documented, our secondary purposes were to 1) fabricate a power measurement system to determine the actual power associated with pedaling the exercise cycle across a range of resistance levels and pedaling rates before and after the experimental trials and 2) compare the actual power, as determined by the power measurement system, to the power displayed by the exercise cycle console. This study could serve as an important first step to utilizing a cycling workstation to reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity in office settings.
