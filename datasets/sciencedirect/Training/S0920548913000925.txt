@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The paper presents part of a study on collective knowledge and innovations in IT as well as an extract segment from a comparative statistical analysis of trends in the global–local standardisation of the pathways of knowledge and IT innovations in IT applications. The aim of the paper is to provide and promote educational and financial resources for the quality of knowledge in IT application. ISO (global) and SRPS (local) documents on IT and IT applications have been extracted from this statistical sample and analysed.The main results of the research are presented with phases of the PDCA methodology

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The paper deals with standardised pathways of knowledge and innovations in information technologies (IT), particularly in the subfields of IT application in industry. There is a growing problem in terms of the continuous improvement of individual knowledge in relation to standardised (partly public and collective) knowledge of new technologies. One aspect of the problem is the continuous improvement of product quality (education services), another concerns the price of knowledge, and a third pertains to the presentation of knowledge [1]. Analysis of the standardisation of collective or global knowledge in the subfields of IT innovations and IT applications is primarily based on ISO standardisation [2], supported by documents for the operationalisation of processes by virtue of individual knowledge. The study also encompasses the pathway of local knowledge in SRPS (SRPS is an abbreviation for the standards in Serbia [3]). Over the last few years SRPS have been created by using European norms (EN) on the local environment platform of the European Union (EU), a new concept.The expansion of IT innovations and IT applications permanently widens the gap between collective and individual knowledge. With IT applications and IT innovations, the distance between the collective and individual becomes self-evident and manifests a tendency towards ever-increasing growth. With the globalisation of business and localisation of financial crises, additional state issues directly affect education.With the advent of IT innovations, appropriate solutions to these issues became possible. The paper presents skills, innovations and experiences which are of particular importance in standardised IT applications and have been accumulated over years. The quality of IT services and IT innovations requires a multidisciplinary approach as well as teamwork by experts in various scientific fields.As in [4], this paper points to the fact that standards play a key role in the development of IT infrastructure in emerging economies and places further emphasis on the significance of IT standard innovation. The problem in many environments is how to obtain information and then create new forms of knowledge from existing information. The solution to this problem requires the use of the top-down principle which enables information to be transformed into social knowledge and the standardisation of knowledge presentation [1], as in this paper.The global classification of IT innovation subfields, IT applications and the accompanying knowledge for organisational innovations has been applied. This classification is of both strategic and national importance for knowledge management. According to the International Classification of Standards (ICS), information technologies are classified in field 35, which comprises 12 segments. The paper focuses on IT innovations and IT applications (field 35.240, including 25.040) which are classified in 11 subfields, ICS-3=35.240.xy [2,3]:35.240.01 — application of information technology in general35.240.10 — computer-aided design (CAD)35.240.15 — identification cards and related devices, including application of cards for banking, trade, telecommunications, transport35.240.20 — IT applications in office work, including text processing systems, text communication, text presentation, Office Document Architecture (ODA)35.240.30 — IT applications in information, documentation and publishing, including Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML), automatic translation machines35.240.40 — IT applications in banking, including automatic banking facilities, identification cards for banking purposes35.240.50 — IT applications in industry, including design automation and industrial automation systems35.240.60 — IT applications in transport and trade, including EDIFACT and e-commerce35.240.70 — IT applications in science, including digital geographic information35.240.80 — IT applications in healthcare technology, including computer tomography35.240.99 — IT applications in other fields, including e-learning; IT applications represent only one of the 12 dimensions of IT (or IT innovations), but are nevertheless significant for the learning management system in multiple dimensions: strategic, dynamic, institutional, resources and E-learning. All of these dimensions are subordinate to the target research of IT applications–IT innovations.An illustration of the hypotheses follows which presents key components of the research results leading to the final goals.The initial hypotheses express the need for clear answers to the acquisition of collective knowledge with the aim of improving the final product — IT services and IT products. The goals set in the paper are presented by way of interesting and important trends in IT applications, through the key results of knowledge management for IT applications, as well as through the answers to some pertinent issues (in PDCA) such as:Hypothesis 1Plan-phaseIt is possible to plan (at the state level) the resources necessary for IT innovations and IT applications on the pathways of knowledge (collective and standardised knowledge, as part of social knowledge for individual results).To establish an adequate business organisation, it is necessary to determine the extent of available knowledge and IT innovations, or the size of quantity indices of: publications (Iqp), new projects under development (Iqu), Innovations (Iqi): collective/global–local (or national), or individual knowledge required for professional work, for improving the quality of services of IT applications and solving practical problems (for example, the problems encountered on the pathways to education).The critical aspects of knowledge and the possibility of anticipating the trends and necessary resources for individual updating of knowledge in the subfields or segments of IT applications according to the obtained results (price indices, innovation value indices — Ivin or Ivu=Ivis+Ivia≈Ivis).It is impossible to provide a single resource for discontinuous (cumulative ∑Ivp) and continuous improvement of knowledge on the paths to the adequate levels of the quality of product innovation, with the need to comply with innovated standards for IT applications and publications (Ivin/35.240/year and ∑Ivp/35.240). Moreover, many papers (including this one) aim at improving the exchange of knowledge using IT innovations and implementing tools in IT applications.In addition to providing the evidence for the given hypotheses, this paper strives to inform government, state institutions, faculties and individual innovators (both graduate students and teaching staff who, within the field of IT applications, should ask themselves the following question: what have we learned? [5]). In addition, since user participation in the standardisation process is becoming more important [6], the paper may be useful for innovators who are developing new standards (innovations) in the subfields of IT application.The significance of this research lies in clustering the areas of IT application, determining the period necessary for updating the knowledge in PDCA, and explicitly defining the criteria which show the limited possibilities of knowledge innovation that require appropriate solutions. In short, the significance of the research is presented in the form of highlights.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We conclude that the field of IT applications requires daily updating of knowledge, and some particular subfields on weekly or monthly basis. Studies provide additional practical benefits (globally and locally) in each country, especially in the member states of the ISO.Contribution of this work to academic community is in practical monitoring of collective knowledge trends in IT applications with the goal of better organisation of the educational system: schools, universities, individuals (with individual knowledge), the wider community, all on the standardisation platform. The specific contribution of research (on the location of the author — in Serbia) has resulted in creation of a new module in the study program “IT applications in industry”. Newly created module “IT applications in industry” (with 240 ECTS) entered the accreditation procedure in 2013 and is going to be realized in the following five years. The first generation of these advanced studies will be enrolled in 2014, the fifth generation in 2019, therefore this study will be realized until the 2023year at least. For the education of IT-teachers in future, studying program module “IT in Education” (300 ECTS) has been created. Expected long-term contribution in this area is reflected in the application of IT, so that the first generation of IT-teachers will complete their studies in 2019. After that period of time, they will educate younger generation on the platform of innovation and standardisation of IT trends.It is possible to draw conclusions from the set goals, key results and answers to pertinent questions (e.g. resolving the dilemmas of the preliminary hypotheses in PDCA: Hypothesis 1 for Plan-phases — Section 5.1, Hypothesis 2 for Do-phases — Section 5.2, Hypothesis 3 for Check-phases — Section 5.3 and Hypothesis 4 for Advancement-phases — Section 5.4). On the basis of the presented results and analyses, the examples of IT applications in relation to all subfields, and the aggregate time index of innovation, it can be concluded that the IT application subfield requires daily knowledge updates.Both practice and the results of the analyses demonstrate that the standards of knowledge and IT innovations are not equally viable financially and organisationally (for resources planning, see Section 5.1). Consequently, results of individual work (without teamwork) are a drop in the bucket compared with social, strategically targeted results and the breadth of knowledge, on the way to sustained improvement of the quality of education and a higher level of social (collective) knowledge in relation to individual knowledge. The problem is even more pronounced in emerging economies, where decisions are expected at the highest level, the level of government. On the basis of these results (Sections 4 and 4.1 to Section 4.8, in phases: P0, P1 and P2), implicit conclusions can be drawn.The presented results of original analyses of one of the 12 areas of IT innovations enable a more precise determination of the quantitative (Iq) and financial (Iv) ‘gap’ between individual and collective — global (ISO) and local (or national SRPS) through social knowledge. Furthermore, they open up new possibilities for further research of IT innovations in education (E-learning), IT applications in industry and other fields as well. It has been established that it is necessary to continuously update individual knowledge in all subfields with positive coefficients of the trend line of collective knowledge and according to time indices of innovation (in nine of the 11 subfields of IT applications — see Section 5.2, Table 3).What is critical on the created pathways of standardised knowledge are financial resources (Iv), but the corresponding organisation of human resources at the local level can produce better results. According to the trends present in the pathways of collective knowledge towards ISO documentation and projects under development, the obtained mathematical relations (presented trend lines, from the theoretical perspective), or individual knowledge of the stages of new project development (from the practical perspective), it is possible to anticipate future resources and financial requirements both as a whole and in terms of segments/subfields. The results of these analyses allow for the creation of an original methodology for the comparison of innovation in all technologies. This is achieved by defined indices which serve as criteria for grouping/clustering/checking appropriate subfields and/or fields of human endeavour (see Section 5.3).The results of the analyses (for ICS-2=35.240 and ICS-2=25.040, see Section 5.4 and future directions for limiting aggregate criterion of value exceeds 300000 CHF!) show an inability to access innovated standards for knowledge improvement: significant differences between discontinuous and continuous improvement of knowledge, the average annual requirement of new ISO-SRPS documents under development, IT innovation on the pathway to knowledge innovation.Although the subfield of IT applications has been extensively imbued with SRPS standards in recent years (because of Serbia's preparations for EU accession), it does not mean that the same trend will continue in the following years. On the other hand, the development trend of ISO standards is continuously supported by various technical committees.Taking into consideration the criterion of value and the comparison of knowledge unit bases (ISO-SRPS), special attention should be given to future research in manufacturing engineering subfields with a focus on IT applications in industry (industrial automation systems; see Section 4.4).
