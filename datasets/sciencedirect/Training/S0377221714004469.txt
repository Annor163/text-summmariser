@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the ranking of decision alternatives in decision analysis problems under uncertainty, under very weak assumptions about the type of utility function and information about the probabilities of the states of nature. Namely, the following two assumptions are required for the suggested method: the utility function is in the class of increasing continuous functions, and the probabilities of the states of nature are rank-ordered. We develop a simple analytical method for the partial ranking of decision alternatives under the stated assumptions. This method does not require solving optimization programs and is free of the rounding errors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Within the framework of expected utility theory an alternative x′ is preferred to alternative x″ if the expected utility of x′ is greater than the expected utility of x″ (see, e.g., Fishburn, 1970). In practice, however, the utility function may be difficult to assess, and the probability distribution may not be completely known. In particular note that the assumption of an additive utility function is a fairly strong assumption to make (Allais, 1953).There exists extensive literature that deals with different relaxations of the above standard assumptions. For example, the literature on stochastic dominance (Whitmore and Findlay, 1978; Levy, 2006; Post and Kopa, 2013) generally assumes that the utility function is unknown and belongs to a certain class of functions, while the probability distribution on the set of states of nature is known. The opposite case in which the utility function is known but the information about probabilities is incomplete, is considered, for example, in Fishburn (1964, 1965), Hazen (1986), and Parkan (1994).A more difficult case arises when both the utility function is not known exactly (but a class of functions to which it belongs is specified) and the information about probabilities is incomplete. Based on this assumption, the ranking of decision alternatives requires solving nonlinear optimization problems (Weber, 1987; Moskowitz et al., 1993). Pearman and Kmietowicz (1986) consider a special case in which the probabilities are described by sets of linear inequalities, and the utility function is assumed either monotone or monotone and concave. In both cases the comparison of decision alternatives leads to the solution of linear programs. Keppe and Weber (1990) show that the use of so-called P-matrices reduces the number of linear programs that need to be solved. In special cases of the latter paper, the solution of linear programs is not even required.Methodologically close to the above description are multi-criteria decision problems (under certainty) in which the weights of criteria (coefficients of importance) and/or criteria values for different alternatives are not known precisely (Podinovski, 2004). In particular, some methods developed for the former problems are applicable to the (single-criterion) decision problems under uncertainty considered in this paper. This includes methods developed for problems with homogeneous criteria – by definition the latter have a common scale. Examples of such methods that are based on a further assumption of an additive value function include analytical approaches of Kirkwood and Sarin (1985) and Corrizosa et al. (1995). Further examples of methods equally applicable to both types of problem include methods of criteria importance theory (Podinovski, 1993, 2002) – and these do not assume the existence of a value function. Note however that not all methods are transferable between the two types of problem. For example, the optimizing method of Eum et al. (2001) is not applicable to the decision problems considered in our paper.In our paper we contribute to the literature by considering the case based on a very weak assumption on the utility function and a further assumption that the probabilities of the states of nature are ordered by their value. We develop a simple analytical method that allows the partial ranking of decision alternatives under the stated assumptions. This method does not require the solution of optimization programs.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic definitions and notation. Section 3 contains the main result of our paper – a method for pairwise comparison of alternatives. Section 4 presents an illustrative application. The concluding Section 5 summarizes our development. All proofs are given in Appendix A.We use the following notation:X – the set of decision alternativesS={s1,…, sn} – the set of states of natureη(x,si) – the consequence (pay-off) to the decision maker defined by alternative x and state si(we may view η is a function whose domain is X×S and codomain is H – the latter is the set of all possible consequences)p=(p1,…, pn) – the probability distribution on S: piis the probability that siis the true state of natureu(η(x,si)) – the utility of the consequence η(x,si).For simplicity, instead of the vector of utilities (u(η(x,s1)),…, u(η(x,sn)), we use notation u(x)=(u1(x),…, un(x)), where ui(x)=u(η(x,si)).If both the probability distribution p and utility function u are known, alternatives are ranked according to their expected utility. For an alternative x, the latter is defined as(1)u¯(x)=∑i=1i=npiui(x).Below we assume that the probability distribution p is not known exactly. Instead, we assume that the components of vector p satisfy the following inequalities:(2)p1⩾p2⩾⋯⩾pn>0.Let each non-strict inequality in (2) be either a strict inequality or equality, and let us specifically know which of the two relations is true. For example, we know that either p1>p2 or p1=p2.LetΠ→denote the set of all vectors p that satisfy the stated ordinal information (2). (We also make the standard assumption that all pi>0 and p1+⋯+pn=1.)We further assume that the unknown utility function is of the class U1 of all increasing continuous functions. Following a well-established approach (Weber, 1987; Greco et al., 2008), define the binary relations of non-strict preference R, (strict) preference P, and indifference I, on the set of all alternatives X as follows:(3)x′Rx″ifu¯(x′)⩾u¯(x″)istrueforallp∈Π→andu∈U1;x′Px″iftherelationx′Rx″istruebutx″Rx′isnottrue;x′Ix″ifbothrelationsx′Rx″andx″Rx′aretrue.Consider the setΠ→of all probability vectors p that satisfy (2). Let N1 be the set of all states i that have the highest probability piof occurrence as stated in (2). (Because in (2) we allow equalities, there may be more than one state in this set.) Let i1 be the largest i such that i∈N1. Let N2 be the set of states that have the second highest probability p2, and i2 the largest i such that i∈N2. Continuing this process, finally let Nρbe the set of states i that have the lowest probability among all states, and let iρbe the largest i such that i∈Nρ.For example, let(4)p1>p2=p3>p4.Then N1={1}, i1=1,N2={2,3},i2=3,N3={4}, i3=4, and ρ=3.Suppose we want to compare alternatives x′ and x″ as defined in (3). Define the corresponding vectors of pay-offsa=(a1,…,an),whereai=η(x′,si),i=1,…,n;b=(b1,…,bn),wherebi=η(x″,si),i=1,…,n.Furthermore, for any vector c=(c1,…, cn), let cjbe the vector consisting of the first j components of vector c:cj=(c1,…,cj).Letc↓j=c[1]j,…,c[j]jdenote the vector obtained by permuting the components of vector cjin the non-increasing order:c[1]j⩾⋯⩾c[j]j. For example, if c=(1,4,3), then c2=(1,4) andc↓2=(4,1).Finally, for any two vectors (c1,…, cm) and d=(d1,…, dm), the vector inequality c⩾d is used to denote the set of inequalities between the corresponding components: c1⩾d1,…, cm⩾dm.The following theorem establishes a constructive method for the comparison of alternatives x′ and x″ as defined in (3).Theorem 1The relation x′Rx″ is true if and only if the following inequalities are true:(5)a↓ir⩾b↓ir,r=1,…,ρ.Furthermore, if in(5)all non-strict inequalities are satisfied as equalities, then x′Ix″, otherwise x′Px″.The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A.Remark 1If all states of nature are equally probable, then ρ=1, i1=n, and (5) is reduced to the single inequality a↓⩾b↓, wherea↓=a↓nandb↓=b↓n. This is equivalent to the result obtained in Podinovski (1975) stated in terms of multi-criteria problems. In particular, Podinovski (1975) showed that the corresponding preference relation R arising in multi-criteria problems could be regarded as the ordinal formulation of the principle of insufficient reason for decision making under ignorance (Luce and Raiffa, 1957).Let n=4 and p satisfy (4). Then i1=1, i2=3, i3=4, and ρ=3. Consider three alternatives x1, x2 and x3 whose values η(x,s) are shown in Table 1.To verify relation x1Rx2, we use Theorem 1. For x′=x1 and x″=x2 we have:a1=4,a↓1=4;b1=3,b↓1=3;a3=(4,3,4),a↓3=(4,4,3);b3=(3,2,7),b↓3=(7,3,2);a4=(4,3,4,8),a↓4=(8,4,4,3);b4=(3,2,7,2),b↓4=(7,3,2,2).Then inequalities (5) take on the form:a[1]1⩾b[1]1,i.e.4⩾3;a[1]3⩾b[1]3,a[2]3⩾b[2]3,a[3]3⩾b[3]3,i.e.4⩾7,4⩾3,3⩾2;a[1]4⩾b[1]4,a[2]4⩾b[2]4,a[3]4⩾b[3]4,a[4]4⩾b[4]4,i.e.8⩾7,4⩾3,4⩾2,3⩾2.Not all of the above inequalities are true and, by Theorem 1, the relation x1Rx2 does not hold. Similarly, x2Rx1 does not hold. Therefore, alternatives x1 and x2 are incomparable with respect to R.Repeating the same procedure for alternatives x1 and x3, we find out that these are also incomparable with respect to R.Let us compare x2 with x3. The inequalities (5) take on the forma[1]1⩾b[1]1,i.e.3⩾2;a[1]3⩾b[1]3,a[2]3⩾b[2]3,a[3]3⩾b[3]3,i.e.7⩾5,3⩾2,2⩾2;a[1]4⩾b[1]4,a[2]4⩾b[2]4,a[3]4⩾b[3]4,a[4]4⩾b[4]4,i.e.7⩾5,3⩾3,2⩾2,2⩾2.Because all of the above inequalities are true and some of them are strict (e.g. 3>2), according to Theorem 1, we have x2Px3.As noted, the same solution methods can be used in the analysis of multi-criteria decision problems utilizing an additive value function, and single-criterion decision problems under uncertainty. Let us demonstrate this using the material selection problem of Kirkwood and Sarin (1985). The 13 decision alternatives and their values on 4 criteria using a common 3-point scale are represented in Table 2.Let the order of criteria correspond to their importance: criterion f1 is more important than f2, f2 is more important than f3, and f3 is more important than f4.Kirkwood and Sarin (1985)implicitly assume the quantitative (interval) criterion scale and use the additive value function(6)v(x)=∑i=1i=nwifi(x),where wiare the weights of criteria: these are nonnegative coefficients that add up to 1 and such that(7)w1>w2>w3>w4>0.Using an improvement to the method of Fishburn (1964, 1965), Kirkwood and Sarin (1985) obtain the partial ordering of decision alternatives that can be represented as in Fig. 1. The preferred alternatives (materials) are quartz, mullite and steatite (these are mutually indifferent), and the least preferred alternative is lead.To illustrate the approach developed in this paper, we make a weaker assumption that the criterion scale is ordinal. Then formula (6) can be stated as(8)v(x)=∑i=1nwiφ(fi(x)),where φ is an arbitrary continuous increasing function. Note that formula (1), where the function u is only known to be continuous and increasing, with condition (2) is identical to formula (8) with condition (7). Let us use the method developed in our paper.For alternatives x1 and x5 we havea[1]1⩾b[1]1,i.e.3=3;a[1]2⩾b[1]2,a[2]2⩾b[2]2,i.e.3=3,3>1;a[1]3⩾b[1]3,a[2]3⩾b[2]3,a[3]3⩾b[3]3,i.e.3=3,3>1,2>1;a[1]4⩾b[1]4,a[2]4⩾b[2]4,a[3]4⩾b[3]4,a[4]4⩾b[4]4,i.e.3=3,3=3,2>1,2>1.Therefore, x1Px5.For alternatives x7 and x13, we havea[1]1⩾b[1]1,i.e.3>2;a[1]2⩾b[1]2,a[2]2⩾b[2]2,i.e.3=3,1<2;a[1]3⩾b[1]3,a[2]3⩾b[2]3,a[3]3⩾b[3]3,i.e.3=3,1<2,1<2;a[1]4⩾b[1]4,a[2]4⩾b[2]4,a[3]4⩾b[3]4,a[4]4⩾b[4]4,i.e.3=3,3=3,1<2,1<2.Therefore x7 and x13 are incomparable with respect to R.The results of all pairwise comparison coincide with the ranking of alternatives obtained by Kirkwood and Sarin (1985) as shown in Fig. 1. (The task of comparing all pairs of alternatives is simplified by noting that the resulting ordering relation is transitive.)Note that, although the results of the two methods are the same, our method is based on a much weaker assumption that the criterion scale is only ordinal. This also appears more realistic, and therefore more reliable, given the description of the scale in Kirkwood and Sarin (1985).
