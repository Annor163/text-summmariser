@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A series of Bi3+ and Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors were synthesized with solid state reaction technique. X-ray diffraction technique was employed to study the structure of prepared samples. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded to investigate the luminescence properties of phosphors. The doping of Bi3+ or Gd3+ with a small amount (no more than 3mol%) does not change the structure of prepared samples remarkably. Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 can emit intense broad-band purplish blue light peaking at 428nm under the excitation of a broad-band peaking at 329nm. The optimal doping concentration of Bi3+ is experimentally ascertained to be 0.5mol%. The decay time of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.88 to 1.69ms. Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 can be excited with 254nm ultraviolet light and yield intense 312nm emission. The optimal doping concentration of Gd3+ is experimentally ascertained to be 5mol%. The decay time of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.42 to 1.36ms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Zinc borates are a group of eco-friendly, halogen-free fire retardant materials with different ratio of ZnO, B2O3, and H2O. They are extensively used in plastic, rubber or coating industry for their advantages, such as innocuity, low water solubility, high thermal stability, small granularity and density and good dispersibility [1–5]. In recent years, ZnB2O4 has started to attract attention because it can be used as a host in phosphor luminescence applications [6–9]. Li et al. synthesized Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors and investigated their photoluminescence (PL), three dimensional thermoluminescence (TL) and dosimetry characteristics following 60Co gamma-ray irradiation. They concluded that Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped ZnB2O4 had potential use as the materials in gamma-ray TL dosimeter for clinical dosimetry [6,7]. Zheng et al. prepared Eu3+ doped ZnB2O4 with co-precipitation method and studied the luminescence properties of Eu3+ in it [8]. Liu et al. prepared Eu3+ and Bi3+ co-activated ZnB2O4 with solid state reactions and found Eu3+ in ZnB2O4 exhibits a dominant emission peak at 610nm under the excitation at 393nm. By co-doping Bi3+ in ZnB2O4:Eu3+, the emission intensity and quantum efficiency can be efficiently enhanced by an increment of 14% and 6%, respectively [9].However, literature [9] did not refer to the luminescence properties of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4. Thus the sensitization mechanism of Bi3+ on Eu3+ in ZnB2O4 is still unclear. The investigation about the luminescence properties of Bi3+ in a host is very significant because Bi3+ can be used as not only an activator but also a sensitizer in many hosts [10–14]. Furthermore, Gd3+ is also a sensitizer for some rare earth (RE) ions such as Eu3+, Tb3+ and Pr3+[15–17]. With the sensitization of Gd3+, these RE ions can effectively emit visible light under 254nm irradiation from low pressure mercury vapor lamps, indicating that these phosphors can be useful for display applications. To the best of our knowledge, no literature reported the luminescence properties of Bi3+ and Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 up to now. Therefore, we will report this in the present paper. The effect of doping concentrations of luminescent center ions on the luminescence is discussed. The motivation of this work is to provide a clear comprehension on the luminescence properties of Bi3+ and Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 and evaluate their potential as luminescent materials for display applications.All the investigated phosphors were synthesized with traditional solid state reactions. Firstly, raw materials ZnO (A.R.), H3BO3 (A.R.), Bi2O3 (A.R.) and Gd2O3 (4N) were accurately weighed according to the composition of Zn1−xB2O4:Bi3+x(x=0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03), Zn1−yB2O4:Gd3+y(y=0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07). The weighed materials were put into an agate mortar and ground with an agate mill in order to mix them thoroughly. Then they were heated up to 850°C in a muffle furnace. The samples were kept at 850°C in air for 10h, and subsequently allowed to cool down in the furnace. The cooled samples were ground again before they were measured and analyzed.The phase identification of prepared phosphors was carried out by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD). The excitation, emission and decay curves of the phosphors were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. As for the details of these instruments, the reader is referred to our previous literatures [18–20]. The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Shimadzu 2450 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Bi3+ or Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors were synthesized with high temperature solid state reactions. The XRD analysis shows that a small amount (no more than 3mol%) of Bi3+ or Gd3+ can be well incorporated into ZnB2O4. Under 329nm excitation, Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 can emit broad-band purplish blue light peaking at 428nm, which can be used in white light-emitting diodes or as a sensitizer for other luminescent center ions. In this work, the optimal doping concentration of Bi3+ is 0.5mol%. The decay time of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.88 to 1.69ms. Under 254nm irradiation, Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 can effectively emit 312nm UV light, which can be exploited to induce energy transfer from Gd3+ to RE3+. The synthesis of ZnB2O4 codoped with Gd3+ and RE3+ and investigation of their luminescence properties are under our consideration. These phosphors codoped with Gd3+ and RE3+ can be prospective materials for display applications. The optimal doping concentration of Gd3+ is 5mol%. The decay time of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.42 to 1.36ms.
