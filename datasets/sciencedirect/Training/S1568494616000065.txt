@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Interval fuzzy preference relations that can well cope with the vagueness and uncertainty are commonly used by the decision maker. The most crucial issue is how to derive the interval priority vector from an interval fuzzy preference relation. This paper first analyzes the size of the interval priority weights. Then, two linear programming models are built, by which the interval priority weights are obtained, respectively. Considering the inconsistent case, two consistency-based linear programming models are built to derive the additive consistent fuzzy preference relations. Different to the current methods, new models consider the consistency and the interval priority weight simultaneously. In some situations, the decision maker may only offer an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, namely, some judgments are missing. To cope with this situation, we first classify the missing intervals into three categories and then apply the associated linear equations to denote the missing values. After that, we construct two consistency-based linear programming models to determine the missing values to cope with the consistent and inconsistent cases. It is worth noting that the built models can cope with the situation where ignorance objects exist. Meanwhile, the associated numerical examples are offered, and the analysis comparison is made.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Preference relations are an important and relatively simple decision-making method, which only need the decision maker to compare a pair of objects at a time. Then, the objects are ranked according to the priority vector that is generated from the preference relation. Generally speaking, there are three kinds of preference relations [1]: multiplicative preference relations [2,3], fuzzy preference relations [4–6] and linguistic preference relations [7–9]. With respect to these types of preference relations, there are many approaches to derive the priority vector [10–22]. All of the above preference relations need the decision maker to offer the exact judgments. However, the practical decision-making problems are becoming more and more complex. It is insufficient to fully express the decision maker's judgments by using exact values. To address this issue, Saaty and Vargas [23] introduced interval reciprocal (or multiplicative) preference relations, which permit the decision maker to use the intervals in [1/9, 9] to express his/her preferences. Then, the authors developed a Monte Carlo simulation approach to obtain the interval priority vector. After that, a number of methods to derive the interval priority vector are developed [24–34].In addition to interval reciprocal preference relations, interval fuzzy (or complementary) preference relations [35] are another important class of preference relations, which can be regarded as an extension of fuzzy preference relations [5]. Xu [35] introduced a priority method to determine the priority vector from an interval fuzzy preference relation. After the pioneer work of Xu [35], there are many studies about interval fuzzy preference relations [36–39]. However, all these researches are insufficient to cope with the inconsistent case, and in sometimes, it is necessary to adjust the decision maker's judgments [41]. Later, Wang and Chen [40] introduced the concept of geometric transitivity of interval fuzzy preference relations, which is equivalent to multiplicative consistent interval fuzzy preference relations [39]. After that, the authors built the logarithmic least squares model to derive the interval priority vector. However, the method in [40] ignores the complementary of the consistency of the lower and upper bounds of the interval preferences. Using the convex combination method, Liu et al. [41] considered an interval fuzzy preference relation to be consistent when two related fuzzy preference relations are consistent. This method is based on the assumption that the decision maker has the same risk-attitude for all his/her interval judgments. Recently, Zhang et al. [42] applied the convex combination method to develop an approach to generate the interval priority vector from interval fuzzy preference relations. The main advantage of this method is that it endows the decision maker with different risk-preferences. However, when the methods in [36,41,42] adjust the inconsistent interval fuzzy preference relations, none of them consider the interval priority vector.Based on the above analysis, this paper continues to study interval fuzzy preference relations, and develops a new method, which can overcome the issues in [36,41,42]. To do this, we first analyze the size of the interval priority weights. Then, several consistency-based liner programming models to calculate the interval priority weight are built. As researchers [43–56] noted, because of the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making problems and the lack of the associated expertise, the decision maker may only provide partial judgments for the compared objects, which is the so-called incomplete preference relations [52]. To cope with incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations, we further construct four linear programming models to estimate the missing values with respect to each object, and the missing values are endowed with the arithmetic mean of all obtained optimal solutions. Then, the interval priority weights are derived by using the previous built models. It is worth noting that no matter which kind of interval fuzzy preference relations is considered: consistent or inconsistent, complete or incomplete, the interval priority weights are all derived from additive consistent fuzzy preference relations.The rest part of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we first review some basic concepts about fuzzy preference relations and interval fuzzy preference relations. Then, we briefly analyze several studies. In Section 3, we mainly consider complete interval fuzzy preference relations. To derive the interval priority weights, four consistency-based linear programming models are constructed, by which the interval priority weight is obtained from the associated additive consistent fuzzy preference relations. In Section 4, we mainly discuss incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations. To obtain the missing values, linear programming models that are based on the consistency and the interval priority weight are constructed. Then, we assign the arithmetic mean of all obtained optimal solutions to denote the missing values. Meanwhile, numerical examples are given to show the concrete application of the built models, and the comparison with several methods is offered. The conclusion is made in the last section.Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be the object set. A fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×n[5] on X is a fuzzy set on the product set X×X, i.e., it is characterized by a membership function μR: X×X→[0,1], where rij=μR(xi, xj) means the preferred degree of the object xiover xj. In this paper, we always assume thatR=(rij)n×nsatisfies the additive reciprocity property, namely, rij+rji=1 for all i, j=1, 2, …, n. Considering the consistency of fuzzy preference relations, Tanino [57] introduced the following concept.Definition 1[57]The fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×nis called additive consistency, if it satisfies(1)rij=rik+rkj−0.5for all i, k, j=1, 2, …, n with i<k<j and rij+rji=1.Let w=(w1, w2, …, wn) be a vector such that∑i=1nwi=1andwi≥0for all i=1, 2, …, n. For the fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×n, if we have(2)rij=0.5(wi−wj+1),i,j=1,2…,nsuchthati<j,thenR=(rij)n×nis additive consistency [58].However, we cannot guarantee that Eq. (2) holds for an additive consistent fuzzy preference relation. For example, let the fuzzy preference relation R be given as follows:R=0.50.810.20.50.700.30.5,One can easily check that R is additive consistency. However, according to Eq. (2), we obtainw1=2.6/3,w2=0.8/3andw3=−0.4/3.LetR=(rij)n×nbe additive consistency, then we can prove that the priority vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn) ofR=(rij)n×ncan be expressed by(3)wi=∑k=1n2rik+1−nn,i=1,2,…,n.To avoid the situation wherewi<0for some i=1, 2, …, n, Meng and Chen [55] defined the priority vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn) as follows:(4)ωi=wi∑j=1nwj,i=1,2,…,n.wherewi=max0,∑k=1n2rik+1−nnforalli=1,2,…n.Although researchers argued that there are many reasons to apply fuzzy preference relations in the AHP, it requires the decision maker to offer exact preferences by using the values in [0,1]. However, in practical decision-making problems, there usually exist various kinds of uncertain and fuzzy factors. To cope with this situation, interval fuzzy preference relations may be a good choice.Definition 2[35]An interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×non X is an interval fuzzy set on the product set X×X, i.e., it is characterized by an interval membership functionμ¯R:X×X→[0,1], wherer¯ij=μ¯R(xi,xj)means the interval preferred degree of the object xiover xj. In general, it satisfies lij+uji=1 and lii=uii=0.5 for all i, j=1, 2, …, n.With respect to interval fuzzy preference relations, there are two additive consistency concepts.Definition 3[36]LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation, if there is a vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn) such thatlij≤0.5(wi−wj+1)≤uij,i,j=1,2,…,nwithi<jwhere w satisfies∑i=1nwi=1andwi≥0for all i=1, 2, …, n. Then, A is said to be additive consistency.In other words, Xu and Chen [36] considered an interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nis additive consistent if there is an additive consistent fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×nsuch that lij≤rij≤uijand rij+rji=1 for all i, j=1, 2, …, n. However, that this conclusion does not hold, namely, for an additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation, we cannot guarantee that there is a normal weight vector such that the condition given in Definition 3. Using the convex combination method, Liu et al. [41] introduced another additive consistent concept.For the interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×n, letB=(bij)n×nandC=(cij)n×nbe two fuzzy preference relations, where(5)bij=liji<jliji=juiji>jandcij=uiji<juiji=jliji>jfor all i, j=1, 2, …, n.Definition 4[41]LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation. If the fuzzy preference relations B and C defined by Eq. (5) are additive consistency, then A is called an additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation.As Wang [57] noted that the consistent concept given in Definition 4 is depended on the label of the object and does not satisfy the permutations of the decision maker's judgments. This means that the ranking order of the compared objects may be different just because for their compared sequences. Thus, the rationality of the methods in [41,32,59] needs to be further considered. Furthermore, some researchers [33,42] noted that Definition 4 is based on the assumption that the decision maker has the same risk-attitude for all his/her interval judgments. To allow the decision maker to have different risk-attitudes, Zhang et al. [42] gave a more flexible convex combination method.For the interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×n, letR=(rij)n×nbe a fuzzy preference relation, where(6)rij=lij+(uij−lij)αiji<j0.5i=j1−rjii=jsuch that αij∈[0, 1] for all i, j=1, 2, …, n.Combining Definition 1 and Eq. (6), Zhang et al. [42] built two linear programming models to derive the interval priority vector, which are called the most pessimistic and optimistic additive consistent fuzzy preference relations. Then, the interval priority vector is obtained from these two consistent fuzzy preference relations. At present, almost of all methods [27,38,39,41,42] to generate the interval priority vector are based on the same consistency or inconsistency (interval) fuzzy preference relations. As we know, the decision maker used interval fuzzy preference relations rather than exact ones because he/she does not ascertain for the preference between the compared objects. Then, how do we drive the interval priority vector according to the given interval fuzzy preference relation? Is it necessary to calculate the interval priority vector based on the same consistent fuzzy preference relation? If the answer is negative, How to derive the interval priority vector? Especially, we cannot sure that the decision maker has the same uncertainty for all his/her judgments. Thus, it is more natural to calculate the interval priority vector separately [31].In this section, we introduce a new method to derive the interval priority vector. Different from existing methods, several consistency-based linear programming models are constructed, by which the interval priority weight can be obtained.LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation, andR=(rij)n×nbe a fuzzy preference relation defined by Eq. (6). WhenR=(rij)n×nis additive consistency, then we have [36](7)rij=∑k=1nrik+rkjn−0.5,i,j=1,2,…,nsuchthati<j.From Eq. (7), we obtainrij=2rij+1n+∑k=1i−1rik+rkjn+∑k=i+1j−1rik+rkjn+∑k=j+1nrik+rkjn−12.Thus,(n−2)rijn=∑k=1i−1rik+rkjn+∑k=i+1j−1rik+rkjn+∑k=j+1nrik+rkjn+1n−12=∑k=1i−11−rki+rkjn+∑k=i+1j−1rik+rkjn+∑k=j+1nrik+1−rjkn+1n−12=∑k=1i−11−lki−(uki−lki)αki+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkjn+∑k=i+1j−1lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkjn+∑k=j+1nlikαik+uik(1−αik)+1−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjkn+1n−12=∑k=1i−1lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−lki−(uki−lki)αkin+∑k=i+1j−1lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkjn+∑k=j+1nlikαik+uik(1−αik)−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjkn+n+i−jn−12From Eq. (3), we know that the priority vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn) of R can be expressed by(8)wi=∑j=1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+1−nn,i=1,2,…,n,where∑i=1nwi=1andwi≥0for all i=1, 2, …, n and αij∈[0, 1].Property 1LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation, andR=(rij)n×nbe a fuzzy preference relation defined by Eq.(6). WhenR=(rij)n×nis additive consistency, then the interval priority weightω¯i=[ωi−,ωi+]of the object xi, i=1, 2, …, n, falls into(9)[0,0]∨1n2∑j=i+1nlij−∑j=1i−1uji+2i−n,1n2∑j=i+1nuij−∑j=1i−1lji+2i−n.From Eq. (8), we obtainwi=∑j=1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+1−nn=∑j=1i−12(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+∑j=i+1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+2−nn≥∑j=1i−12lij+∑j=i+1n2lij+2−nn=∑j=1i−12(1−uji)+∑j=i+1n2lij+2−nn=2∑j=i+1nlij−∑j=1i−1uji+2i−nn.Similarly, we havewi≤2∑j=i+1nuij−∑j=1i−1lji+2i−nnfor all i=1, 2, …, n.Since1n2∑j=i+1nlij−∑j=1i−1uji+2i−nand1n2∑j=i+1nuij−∑j=1i−1lji+2i−nmay be smaller than zero, and they are no larger than one, we define Eq. (9) to denote the interval priority weightω¯i. This ensures that it belongs to [0,1].□From Property 1, we know that the interval weightω¯i=[ωi−,ωi+]ofA=([lij,uij])n×ncan be denoted by(10)ω¯i=[0,0]∨min1n∑j=1i−12((uji−lji)αji−uji)+∑j=i+1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+2i−n,max1n∑j=1i−12((uji−lji)αji−uji)+∑j=i+1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+2i−n,where αij∈[0, 1] for all i, j=1, 2, …, n such that i<j.Let αji=αij=0 and αji=αij=1 for all j=1, 2, ..., n with j≠i, we can obtain the maximum and minimum values1n(2(∑j=i+1nlij−∑j=1i−1uji)+2i−n)and1n(2(∑j=i+1nuij−∑j=1i−1lji)+2i−n), respectively. However, Eq. (9) is based on the additive consistent fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×n. Based on the above analysis, we build the following consistency-based linear programming models to calculate the interval priority weightω¯i=[ωi−,ωi+]of the object xiforA=([lij,uij])n×n, where(11)minf=1n∑j=1i−12((uji−lji)αji−uji)+∑j=i+1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+2i−ns.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−lki−(uki−lki)αki)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk)+n2+i−jαij∈[0,1]i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j,and(12)maxg=1n∑j=1i−12((uji−lji)αji−uji)+∑j=i+1n2(lij+(uij−lij)αij)+2i−ns.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−lki−(uki−lki)αki)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk)+n2+i−jαij∈[0,1]i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j.Let α∗ijandαij*be the optimal solutions of models (11) and (12), where i, j=1, 2, …, n such that i<j. Then, we can obtain the minimum and maximum values f∗ and g∗. Combining Eq. (11), we can obtain the interval priority weightω¯i=[ωi−,ωi+], i=1, 2, …, n. Different from Liu et al. method [41], which calculates the endpoints of the interval priority weight from fuzzy preference relations formed by the endpoints of the interval judgment, models (11) and (12) calculate the interval priority weights, respectively, which are based on additive consistent fuzzy preference relations. The methods in [39,41,42] require all interval priority weights to satisfy the same consistency or inconsistency (interval) fuzzy preference relation. Furthermore, the models in [42] are nonlinear programming models in inconsistent case. This increases the difficulty to solve the interval priority weights.One can note that models (11) and (12) can be equivalently expressed by the following two linear programming models:(13)min∑j=1i−1(uji−lji)αji+∑j=i+1n(uij−lij)αijs.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−lki−(uki−lki)αki)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk)+n2+i−jαij∈[0,1]i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<jand(14)max∑j=1i−1(uji−lji)αji+∑j=i+1n(uij−lij)αijs.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−lki−(uki−lki)αki)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk)+n2+i−jαij∈[0,1]i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j.Definition 5LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation. When the optimal solutions of models (11) and (12) (or (13) and (14)) for each object xi, i=1, 2, …, n, are nonempty, then A is considered to be additive consistency.Definition 5 is based on the following analysis. The interval fuzzy preference relation A is called additive consistency when there are additive consistent fuzzy preference relations with respect to the endpoints of the interval priority weight. One can check that an interval fuzzy preference relation is additive consistency according to Definitions 3 and 4, and then it is additive consistency according to Definition 5. However, the opposite conclusion does not hold, see the following example and Example 1. Thus, Definition 5 is a more general consistent concept for interval fuzzy preference relations. To address the special situation where the given interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nsatisfies lij=uijfor all i, j=1, 2, …, n such that i<j, we can use Eq. (4) to calculate the priority vector.As we know, for an additive consistent fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×n, if we have∑k=1n2rik≤n−1for some i=1, 2, …, n, by using Eq. (4), the priority weight ωiis zero. Especially, when there is more than one row such that∑k=1n2rik≤n−1, then we cannot rank the associated objects. To cope with this issue, we can apply the transformation formulae between fuzzy complementary and reciprocal preference relations introduced by Saaty [2] to convert the additive consistent fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×ninto a multiplicative consistent reciprocal preference relation and then use the Eigenvector method [2] to calculate the priority vector.Example 1Suppose that the interval fuzzy preference relationA=(a¯ij)n×nis defined as follows:A=[0.5,0.5][0.2,0.4][0.3,0.5][0.6,0.8][0.6,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.8][0.7,0.9][0.5,0.7][0.2,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.9][0.2,0.4][0.1,0.3][0.1,0.4][0.5,0.5].One can easily check that R' and R'' are both additive consistency. In addition, all of the elements in R' and R'' fall into the associated interval judgments in A. Similarly, the interval priority weights of the objects xi, i=2, 3, 4, are obtained as follows:ω¯2=[0.4,0.75],ω¯3=[0.15,0.55]andω¯4=[0,0].Using the interval ranking formula in [60], the ranking order isx2≻0.92x3≻0.833x1≻1x4.Since the optimal solutions of models (13) and (14) for each object xi, i=1, 2, 3, 4, are nonempty, A given in Example 1 is additive consistency.To show the feasibility and efficiency of the new model, in this example, we select four representative methods [36,39,41,42] for interval fuzzy preference relations to calculate the interval priority vector, the ranking order is obtained as shown in Table 1.Remark 2From Table 1, one can see that the same ranking order is obtained with respect to different methods. In this example, it is worth noting that the methods in [36,42] and the new method are all based on additive consistent (interval) fuzzy preference relations. The method in [39] does not consider the consistency, and the Liu et al. method [41] is based on acceptable consistency. In Liu et al. method [41], the weight vector satisfies multiplicative constraint, namely, the weight vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn) satisfiesΠi=1nwi=1andwi≥0for all i=1, 2, …, n, and the weight vector obtained from the other methods is the additive constraint, that is, the weight vector satisfies w=(w1, w2, …, wn) such that∑i=1nwi=1andwi≥0for all i=1, 2, …, n.However, it is may be difficult to require a decision maker to offer an additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation. That is, models (13) and (14) may have no the feasible solution for some object xi, i=1, 2, …, n. To cope with this issue, we relax the equality constraints in models (13) and (14) and build the following two consistency-based linear programming models for the interval priority weightω¯i=[ωi−,ωi+]of the object xiforA=([lij,uij])n×n, where(15)min∑j=1i−1(uji−lji)αji+∑j=i+1n(uij−lij)αij−∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1n(δij++δij−)s.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−δkj++δkj−−lki−(uki−lki)αki+δik+−δik−)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik−δik++δik−+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−δkj++δkj−)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−δik++δik−−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk+δjk+−δjk−)+n2+i−jlij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≥0i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<jlij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≤1i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<jαij∈[0,1],δij+,δij−≥0i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j.and(16)max∑j=1i−1(uji−lji)αji+∑j=i+1n(uij−lij)αij−∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1n(δij++δij−)s.t.(n−2)(lij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−)=∑k=1i−1(lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−δkj++δkj−−lki−(uki−lki)αki+δik+−δik−)+∑k=i+1j−1(lik+(uik−lik)αik−δik++δik−+lkj+(ukj−lkj)αkj−δkj++δkj−)i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j+∑k=j+1n(lik+(uik−lik)αik−δik++δik−−ljk−(ujk−ljk)αjk+δjk+−δjk−)+n2+i−jlij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≥0i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<jlij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≤1i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<jαij∈[0,1],δij+,δij−≥0i,j=1,2,…,ns.t.i<j.Models (15) and (16) are constructed to achieve two goals. The adjustment to the decision maker's original judgments should be as small as possible. Meanwhile, the left and right endpoints of the interval priority weight should reach their maximum and minimum values, respectively.By solving models (15) and (16), we can obtain the values αij,δij+andδij−for all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j. Additionally, the associated fuzzy preference relationsRi=(rij)n×nandRi'=(rij')n×nwith respect to the optimal solutions of models (15) and (16) can be derived. Then, we adjust the fuzzy preference relations RiandRi'by using the obtained valuesδij+andδij−. For example, let the optimal valueδij+of model (15) be larger than zero, then we revise rijasrij−δij+. Whenδij−≠0, we adjust rijasrij+δij−. LetR⌢ibe the associated adjusted fuzzy preference relation, one can check thatR⌢iis additive consistency. Then, according toR⌢i, we use Eq. (4) to calculate the priority weightωi−.Remark 3To ensure the interval priority vector obtained from additive consistent fuzzy preference relations, we add the constraintslij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≥0andlij+(uij−lij)αij−δij++δij−≤1into models (15) and (16). When the optimal solutions of models (15) and (16) are empty, the associated interval fuzzy preference relation should be returned to the decision maker to adjust the judgments.Consider the following interval fuzzy preference relationA=[0.5,0.5][0.3,0.4][0.5,0.6][0.4,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.8][0.2,0.4][0.4,0.5][0.2,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.5,0.6][0.6,0.8][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5].Using the interval ranking formula in [60], the ranking order isx2≻1x4≻0.94x1≻0.857x3.Takeω¯1for example, by using model (15), we obtain the following linear programming model(17)min⁡0.1(⁡α12+α13+α14)+∑i=13∑j=i+14(δij++δij−)s.t.0.2α12−0.1α13−0.1α14+0.2α23+0.2α24−2(δ12+−δ12−)+(δ13+−δ13−)+(δ14+−δ14−)−(δ23+−δ23−)−(δ24+−δ24−)=0.5−0.1α12+0.2α13−0.1α14−0.2α23+0.1α34+(δ12+−δ12−)−2(δ13+−δ13−)+(δ14+−δ14−)+(δ23+−δ23−)−(δ34+−δ34−)=−0.2−0.1α12−0.1α13+0.2α14−0.2α24−0.1α34+(δ12+−δ12−)+(δ13+−δ13−)−2(δ14+−δ14−)+(δ24+−δ24−)+(δ34+−δ34−)=−0.30.1α12−0.1α13+0.4α23−0.2α24+0.1α34−(δ12+−δ12−)+(δ13+−δ13−)−2(δ23+−δ23−)+(δ24+−δ24−)−(δ34+−δ34−)=−0.30.1α12−0.1α14−0.2α23+0.4α24−0.1α34−(δ12+−δ12−)+(δ14+−δ14−)+(δ23+−δ23−)−2(δ24+−δ24−)+(δ34+−δ34−)=0.80.1α13−0.1α14+0.2α23−0.2α24+0.2α34−(δ13+−δ13−)+(δ14+−δ14−)−(δ23+−δ23−)+(δ24+−δ24−)−2(δ34+−δ34−)=−0.5−0.1α12+δ12+−δ12−≤0.3,0.1α12−δ12++δ12−≤0.7−0.1α13+δ13+−δ13−≤0.5,0.1α13−δ13++δ13−≤0.5−0.1α14+δ14+−δ14−≤0.4,0.1α14−δ14++δ14−≤0.6−0.2α23+δ23+−δ23−≤0.6,0.2α23−δ23++δ23−≤0.4−0.2α24+δ24+−δ24−≤0.2,0.2α24−δ24++δ24−≤0.8−0.1α34+δ34+−δ34−≤0.5,0.1α34−δ34++δ34−≤0.5αij∈[0,1],i=1,2,3;j=2,3,4δij+,δij−≥0,i=1,2,3;j=2,3,4Solve model (17) by Matlab, we deriveα∗12=0.1868,α∗13=α∗14=α∗34=0,α∗23=0.0334,α∗24=1;δ12+=δ13−=δ14+=δ14−=δ23+=δ23−=δ24+=δ34−=0,δ12−=0.046,δ13+=0.0286,δ24−=0.1353,δ34+=0.0714.From B', we obtain the following additive consistent fuzzy preference relationB1=0.50.3650.4710.40.6350.50.6070.5350.5290.3930.50.4290.60.4650.5710.5.With respect to B1, the left endpoint of the interval priority weightω¯1isω1−=0.12.In this example, when the methods in [36,39,41,42] are applied to derive the interval priority vector, the ranking order is obtained as shown in Table 2.Remark 4From Table 2, one can see that different ranking orders are obtained. As pointed above, the methods in [36,39] is insufficient to cope with the inconsistent case, see Example 3. The methods in [39,42] calculate the interval priority weights based on the same preference relation, while the approach in [41] apply two associated fuzzy preference relations to calculate the endpoints of the interval priority weights.For a given n order inconsistent interval fuzzy preference relation A, Zhang et al. [42] selected an n-1 order sub-interval matrix B of A. When models (10) and (11) in [42] have nonempty solution with respect to B, then the authors considered that the inconsistency of A is caused by the judgment of the object that is not included in B. Based on this analysis, the authors adjusted the interval judgments associated to this object by using models (12) and (13) in [42]. However, there are several challenges for this method. One is when there is more than one such n-1 order sub-interval matrix, which one should we select? Furthermore, when we cannot obtain such an n-1 order sub-interval matrix, how do we process? To further decrease the order of the selected matrix? It seems to be complex. As we know, any 2 order interval fuzzy preference relation is additive consistency. When any sub-interval matrix B with no less than 3 order is inconsistent, how do we select the adjusted interval judgment? All these issues are not considered in [42]. All these issues make this method more complex than the other methods. For Example 4.3 in [42], models (14) and (15) in [42] lack a constraint, and the interval priority vector is derived from acceptable consistent reciprocal preference relations rather than consistent ones.Example 3[36,37,41,42]Suppose that the interval fuzzy preference relation A is defined as follows:A=[0.5,0.5][0.4,0.8][0.4,0.7][0.8,0.9][0.2,0.6][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.9][0.6,0.7][0.3,0.6][0.1,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.1,0.2][0.3,0.4][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5].Similar to [41,42], when we convert the obtained additive consistent fuzzy preference relations into the multiplicative reciprocal preference relations and use the Eigenvector method [2] to calculate the interval priority vector, we obtainω¯=[0.24,0.51],[0.14,0.47],[0.17,0.33],[0.08,0.11].Using the interval ranking formula in [60], the ranking order isx1≻0.703x2≻0.658x3≻1x4, which is the same as that obtained by the new method except for their preferred degrees. It is interesting that this process increases the discrimination between the objects.Remark 5In Liu et al.’s method [41], when we adjust the unacceptable reciprocal preference relations with respect to C and D defined by Eq. (7), it is difficult to obtain the same consistent degree. Thus, the endpoints of the interval priority weights are derived from two reciprocal preference relations with different consistent degrees. However, this does influence the size of the interval priority weights, and we cannot sure that this influence is the same for all interval priority weights.From the above given examples, we can see that all listed approaches obtain the same ranking order for the consistent case (see, Example 1). However, different ranking orders are derived for the inconsistent case (see, Examples 2 and 3). The new method calculates the interval priority weights corresponding to different additive consistent fuzzy preference relations, which fully considers the size of each interval priority weight. Thus, we suggest the decision maker to apply the new method to address the inconsistent case, and the decision maker can use any listed approach for the consistent case.With respect to incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations, Xia and Xu [27] built a goal programming model to obtain the interval priority vector, which only uses the known interval judgments. Based on the given interval fuzzy multiplicative transitivity, Genc et al. [37] developed a method to estimate the missing values in an interval fuzzy preference relation, which can only cope with the situation where each alternative is compared at least once. Recently, Xu et al. [61] extended the additive consistency for fuzzy preference relations [3] into interval fuzzy preference relations and presented a method to estimate the missing values. In comparison analysis, the authors pointed out some drawbacks of the method in [49] and showed the advantages of their method. Using the convex combination method in [41], Liu and Zhang [59] constructed a linear goal programming model to estimate the missing values. It is worth noting that the consistency definition in [41,61] is technically wrong, which is highly dependent on the alternative labels and not robust to the permutations of the decision maker's judgments [57]. Furthermore, all methods in [37,57,59–61] cannot deal with the situations where ignorance alternatives exist, namely, all preference values involving one alternative are unknown.To extend the application of interval fuzzy preference relations, this subsection builds several models to estimate the missing judgments, which only use the known interval judgments and can cope with the situations where ignorance alternatives exist. As researchers [57] noted when we extend the consistency concepts for fuzzy preference relations into interval case, there usually exist some problems. Different from existing consistency concepts, we apply fuzzy preference relations to develop an approach to estimate the missing values in interval fuzzy preference relations. As we know, no matter which kind of preference relations, the priority vector should be calculated from (acceptably) consistent preference relations. Otherwise, we should adjust it. Thus, we only care the judgments that form a (or an acceptably) consistent preference relation. Based on this analysis, we construct two consistency-based linear programming models to estimate the missing values.Definition 6[49]LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an interval fuzzy preference relation. If there is at least one missing element in the upper or lower triangular part of A, then A is called an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation.LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, and letR=(rij)n×nbe a fuzzy preference relation such thatrij∈a¯ijand rij+rji=1 for all i, j=1, 2, …, n. Then,R=(rij)n×nis an incomplete fuzzy preference relation.Without loss of generality, suppose thata¯ij=[lij,uij]is incompletely known, where i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j. There are three cases. The first case is that lijis unknown, and uijis known. The second case is that lijis known, and uijis unknown. The third case is that lijand uijare both unknown.For the first case, let(18)rij=uij−(uij−lij)αij=uij−uijαij+lijαijwith lij≤uijand αij∈[0, 1].Since lijand αijare both unknown, Eq. (19) is a nonlinear equation. For simplicity, we convert Eq. (19) into a linear equation. Let βij=lijαij. Considering the constraint of interval judgments, we obtain 0≤βij≤uijαij. Thus, Eq. (19) can be equivalently expressed by(19)fij1=uij−uijαij+βijFor the second case, let(20)rij=lij+(uij−lij)αij=lij+uijαij−lijαijwith lij≤uijand αij∈[0, 1].Similar to the first case, we can use the following linear equation to denote Eq. (20).(21)fij2=lij+γij−lijαijwhere γij=uijαijsuch that lijαij≤γij≤αijand αij∈[0, 1].For the last case, let(22)rij=lijαij+uij(1−αij)=uij+lijαij−uijαijwith lij≤uijand αij∈[0, 1], which can be expressed by the linear equation as follows:(23)fij3=uij+μijl−μijuwhereμijl=lijαijandμiju=uijαijsuch that0≤μijl≤μiju≤uijand uij∈[0, 1].With respect to the known interval judgmenta¯ij=[lij,uij], let(24)fij4=rij=lij+(uij−lij)αijfor all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j.Furthermore, letU1={k|lkjisunknown,andukjisknown,k, j=1, 2, ..., n},U2={k|ukjisunknown,andlkjisknown,k, j=1, 2, ..., n},U3={k|lkjandukjarebothunknown,k, j=1, 2, ..., n},U4={k|lkjandukjarebothknown,k, j=1, 2, ..., n}.LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, and let Ui, i=1, 2, 3, 4, be as shown above. Then,U1={k|ujkisunknown,andljkisknown,k,j=1,2,...,n};U2={k|ljkisunknown,andujkisknown,k,j=1,2,...,n};U3={k|ljkandujkarebothunknown,k,j=1,2,...,n};U4={k|ljkandujkarebothknown,k,j=1,2,...,n}.LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, and let Ui, i =1, 2, 3, 4, be as shown above. For each pair (i, j) such that i<j, we have(i)rji=fji2=1−fij1for any i∈U1;rji=fji1=1−fij2for any i∈U2;rji=1−fij3for any i∈U3;rji=1−fij4for any i∈U4.For (i): From i∈U1, we obtainrji=1−rij=1−fij1=1−uij+uijαij−βij=lji+uijαij−lijαij=lji+(1−lji)αij−(1−uji)αij=lji+ujiαji−ljiαij=lji+γji−ljiαij=fji2,where αij=αjiand γji=ujiαjisuch that ljiαji≤γji≤αjiand αij∈[0, 1]. Similarly, we can obtain the other conclusions.□LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, and letR=(rij)n×nbe an incomplete fuzzy preference relation, where rijis defined by Eqs. (19), (20), (22) or (24) for each pair (i, j) with rij+rji=1 for all i, j=1, 2, …, n.

(19), (21), (23) and (24).Property 4LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation, and letR=(rij)n×nbe an incomplete fuzzy preference relation as shown above. For each pair (i, j) such that i<j, we have(i)γji=αij−βijfor any i∈U1;βji=αij−γijfor any i∈U2;μjil=αij−μijuandμjiu=αij−μijlfor any i∈U3.From i∈U1 and Property 3, we obtainfij1=rij=uij−uijαij+βijandfji2=rji=lji+γji−ljiαjifor i∈U2. Since A is an interval fuzzy preference relation, we obtain lij=1−ujiand uij=1−ljifor all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j.On the other hand, by rij+rji=1 and αij=αjifor all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j, we derive1=fij1+fji2=uij−uijαij+βij+lji+γji−ljiαji=1+βij+γji−ljiαji−uijαij=1+βij+γji−αij.Thus, γji=αij−βij.Similarly, we can obtain the conclusion (ii).For (iii): From Eq. (23), we deriveμjil=ljiαji=(1−uij)αij=αij−uijαij=αij−μijuandμjiu=ujiαji=(1−lij)αij=αij−lijαij=αij−μijl.□WhenR=(rij)n×nis additive consistency, we build the following two consistency-based linear programming models to estimate the missing values for the object xi, i=1, 2, …, n.(29)min∑k=i+1,k∈U1nfik2+∑k=i+1,k∈U2nfik1+∑k=i+1,k∈Uq,q=3,4nfikq−∑k=1,k∈Uq,q=1,2,3,4i−1fkiq+i−0.5s.t.Fi,js=0i,j=1,2,...,n,i<j,⁡i∈Us,s=1,2,3,4and(30)max∑k=i+1,k∈U1nfik2+∑k=i+1,k∈U2nfik1+∑k=i+1,k∈Uq,q=3,4nfikq−∑k=1,k∈Uq,q=1,2,3,4i−1fkiq+i−0.5s.t.Fi,js=0i,j=1,2,...,n,i<j,i∈Us,s=1,2,3,4whereFijsas shown in Eq.

Solving these two models, we can address the missing values by using Eqs. (19), (21) and (23).LetA=(a¯ij)n×n=[lij,uij]n×nbe an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation. If the optimal solutions of models (29) and (30) for each object xi, i= 1, 2, …, n, are nonempty, then A is said to be incomplete additive consistency.We consider that the missing values derived from models (29) and (30) for each object xi, i= 1, 2, …, n, are equally important, and the missing values llkand ulkare defined by(33)llk=∑i=1nl∗lki+llki∗2nandulk=∑i=1nu∗lki+ulki∗2nfor all l, k=1, 2, …, n with l <k, wherel∗lkiandu∗lkiare the optimal solutions of model (29), andllki∗andulki∗are the optimal solutions of model (30). Then, we can apply models (13) and (14) to calculate the interval priority vector.Example 4Assume that there is an incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation A shown as follows:A=[0.5,0.5][0.4,0.6][l13,0.5][0.5,0.7][0.4,0.6][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][l24,u24][0.5,1−l13][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.6,u34][0.3,0.5][1−u24,1−l24][1−u34,0.4][0.5,0.5].Let i =1, according to model (29), we derive(34)min0.2α12−0.5α13+0.2α14+β13+1.9s.t.0.4α12+0.5α13−0.2α14+0.1α23−β13+μ24l−μ24u+u24=0.7−0.2α12−α13−0.2α14−0.1α23−0.6α34+2β13+γ34=−0.2−0.2α12+0.5α13+0.4α14+0.6α34−β13−γ34−μ24l+μ24u−u24=−0.50.2α12+0.5α13+0.2α23−0.6α34−β13+γ34−μ24l+μ24u−u24=−0.50.2α12−0.2α14−0.1α23+0.6α34−γ34+2μ24l−2μ24u+2u24=1.2−0.5α13−0.2α14−0.1α23−1.2α34+β13+2γ34−μ24l+μ24u−u24=−0.7−0.5α13−0.2α14−0.1α23−1.2α34+β13+2γ34−μ24l+μ24u−u24=−0.70≤μ24l≤μ24u≤u24α12,α13,α14,α23,α34,u24∈[0,1].Solving model (34) by Matlab, we obtainα12=α23=α14=0,α13=0.6614,α34=0.6999,β13=0.2307,γ34=0.4199,μ24l=0.0566,μ24u=0.3975,u24=0.9409.Thus, the missing values arel*131=0.3488,u*341=0.5999,l*241=0.134,u*241=0.9409.Similarly, we can obtain the missing values for the other objects, which are shown as in Tables 3 and 4.By using Eq. (33), the missing values arel13=0.4244,l24=0.3116,u24=0.9475,u34=0.6846.Additionally, we derive the following interval fuzzy preference relationA'=[0.5,0.5][0.4,0.6][0.4244,0.5][0.5,0.7][0.4,0.6][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.3116,0.9475][0.5,0.5756][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.6846][0.3,0.5][0.0525,0.6884][0.3154,0.4][0.5,0.5].With respect to the interval fuzzy preference relation A', by using models (13) and (14), we can obtain the optimal values αijfor all i, j=1, 2, 3, 4 with i<j. Then, we can derive the interval priority vectorω¯=[0.17,0.34],[0.3,0.49],[0.25,0.38],[0,0.14].By using the interval ranking formula in [60], the ranking order isx2≻0.8704x3≻0.8167x1≻1x4. In this example, when we convert the additive consistent fuzzy preference relations into the multiplicative consistent reciprocal preference relations and apply the Eigenvector method [2] to calculate the interval priority vector, we obtainω¯=[0.21,0.29],[0.27,0.39],[0.24,0.32],[0.11,0.19],and the ranking order isx2≻0.8698x3≻0.8047x1≻1x4. This is the same as that derived by using Eq. (4) except for their preferred degrees.In general, the incomplete interval fuzzy preference relation offered by the decision maker is inconsistent. This means that Eq. (25) will no longer hold. Let the incomplete interval fuzzy preference relationA=([lij,uij])n×nbe inconsistent, and letR=(rij)n×nbe an incomplete fuzzy preference relation, where rijis defined by Eq.

The main advantage of models (36) and (37) is that they can cope with interval fuzzy preference relations with ignorance objects. Models (36) and (37) have the following features. With respect to the known judgments, the missing values should make the deviation variables as small as possible. Meanwhile, they should get the extreme values of the endpoints of the interval priority weights.Suppose that the incomplete multiplicative preference relation A is defined as follows:A=[0.5,0.5][l12,0.4][l13,0.7][l14,u14][0.6,1−l12][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.8][0.2,u24][0.3,1−l13][0.2,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.4,u34][1−u14,1−l14][1−u24,0.8][1−u34,0.6][0.5,0.5].Let i =1, from model (36), we obtain(38)min−0.4α12−0.7α13+β12+β13+u14+μ14l−μ14u+∑i=13∑j=i+14(δij++δij−)s.t.−0.8α12+0.7α13+0.2α23−0.2α24+2β12−β13+γ24−μ14l+μ14u−u14−2δ12++2δ12−+δ13+−δ13−+δ14+−δ14−−δ23++δ23−−δ24++δ24−=0.10.4α12−1.4α13−0.2α23−0.4α34−β12+2β13+γ34−μ14l+μ14u−u14+δ12+−δ12−−2δ13++2δ13−+δ14+−δ14−+δ23+−δ23−−δ34++δ34−=−0.80.4α12+0.7α13+0.2α24+0.4α34−β12−β13−γ24−γ34+2μ14l−2μ14u+2u14+δ12+−δ12−+δ13+−δ13−−2δ14++2δ14−+δ24+−δ24−+δ34+−δ34−=0.7−0.4α12+0.7α13+0.4α23+0.2α24−0.4α34+β12−β13−γ24+γ34−δ12++δ12−+δ13+−δ13−−2δ23++2δ23−+δ24+−δ24−−δ34++δ34−=−0.1−0.4α12−0.2α23−0.4α24+0.4α34+β12+2γ24−γ34−μ14l+μ14u−u14−δ12++δ12−+δ14+−δ14−+δ23+−δ23−−2δ24++2δ24−+δ34+−δ34−=0.2−0.7α13+0.2α23+0.2α24−0.8α34+β13−γ24+2γ34−μ14l+μ14u−u14−δ13++δ13−+δ14+−δ14−−δ23++δ23−+δ24+−δ24−−2δ34++2δ34−=−0.80≤μ14l≤μ14u≤u140≤β12≤0.4α12,0≤β13≤0.7α130.2α24≤γ24≤α24,0.4α34≤γ34≤α34α12,α13,α23,α24,α34,u14∈[0,1]δij+,δij−≥0,i=1,2,3,j=2,3,4,i<jSolving model (38) by Matlab, we haveα12=1,α13=0.9703,α23=β12=μ14l=0,α24=0.7865,α34=0.7084,β13=0.0149,γ24=0.488,γ34=0.3343,μ14u=0.6074,u14=0.6074From this optimal solution, we derive l12=l14=0, l13=0.0154, u14=0.6074, u24=0.6205, u34=0.4719.Similarly, missing values with respect to each object are obtained as shown in Tables 5 and 6.When model (36) is used to calculate the optimal solutions for i=2, 3, we derive α12=β12=0 and α13=β13=0, namely,l*122andl*133are not a number. In this case, we estimate the missing values by applying the other optimal solutions. For example,l12=0+0.3999+0.4+0.4+0.0526+0.0892+0.07327=0.2021.By using Eq. (33), the other missing values are derived as follows:l13=0.3265,l14=0.4253,u14=0.7239,u24=0.7673,u34=0.6586.Furthermore, we obtain the following interval fuzzy preference relationA'=[0.5,0.5][0.2021,0.4][0.3265,0.7][0.4253,0.7239][0.6,0.7979][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.8][0.2,0.7673][0.3,0.6735][0.2,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.4,0.6586][0.2761,0.5747][0.2327,0.8][0.3414,0.6][0.5,0.5].With respect to A', by using models (15) and (16), the interval priority vector isω¯=[0.00,0.38],[0.36,0.68],[0.00,0.37],[0.00,0.32].Additionally, by using the interval ranking formula in [60], the ranking order isx2≻0.9984x1≻0.5132x3≻0.5676x4.It is worth noting that the methods in [49,57,59,61] to estimate the missing values in an interval fuzzy preference relation cannot be applied in this example for the object x4 being an ignorance alternative.Based on the above analysis, let us introduce an algorithm for interval fuzzy preference relations.Step 1:With respect to the objects xi, i=1, 2, …, n, the decision maker gives his/her interval judgment for each pair of objects xiand xj, i, j=1, 2, …, n with i<j. ByA=(a¯ij)n×n=([lij,uij])n×n, we denote the interval fuzzy preference relation. If A is complete, then turn to Step 3; otherwise, go to the next step;With respect to A, if A is inconsistent, then we use models (36) and (37) to estimate the missing judgments. When A is consistent, then we apply models (31) and (32) to estimate the missing judgments. If there is no fear of conflict, we still use A to denote the associated complete interval fuzzy preference relation.When A is additive consistency, then we apply models (13) and (14) to generate the interval priority vector; otherwise, we utilize models (15) and (16) to calculate the interval priority vector.With respect to the interval priority vector, we apply the interval ranking formula in [60] to rank the objects xi, i=1, 2, …, n.End.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Interval fuzzy preference relations are one of the most common preference relations to express the decision maker's judgments. Since it was first introduced by Xu [35], many methods have been developed. At present, researches about interval fuzzy preference relations can be classified into three types. The first type directly uses methods for fuzzy preference relation to research interval fuzzy preference relations. The second type adopts the convex combination method and studies interval fuzzy preference relations by considering two associated fuzzy preference relations. However, there are some undesirable properties for this kind of methods [57]. The last type extends researches about fuzzy preference relations to discuss interval fuzzy preference relations.Different from existing methods, this paper develops several consistency-based linear programming models to address interval fuzzy preference relations, which can cope with the consistent and inconsistent cases. When an interval fuzzy preference relation is additive consistency, we can see that the new method and some existing methods [36,39,41,42] obtain the same ranking order. However, the ranking orders may be different for the inconsistent case. This is because their principles are different. In some situations, the decision maker can only offer partial interval judgments between objects for various reasons. All existing methods estimate the missing values by using the given consistent concepts. Apart from the rationality of these concepts [4,56], this kind of methods does not consider the interval priority weights. As we know, the missing values do influence the interval priority weights, and this influence may be different when we estimate the missing values by only considering consistency. To cope with this issue, a reasonable approach is to consider the consistency and the interval priority weights simultaneously. Based on this point, we build several consistency-based linear programming models to generate the missing values.There are four advantages of the new method: (i) it is based on consistency analysis, (ii) it considers interval fuzzy priority weights separately, (iii) it can cope with the inconsistent and incomplete cases, and (iv) the missing values are obtained by considering the consistency and the priority weights simultaneously. The disadvantage of the new method is that it needs the decision maker adjust interval preferences when more than one object's interval priority weight equals to zero.Nevertheless, this paper only develops one method to interval fuzzy preference relations that is based on additive consistency, and we will continue to study the other approaches to interval fuzzy preference relations such as in a statistical mean [62]. Furthermore, we shall research other kinds of preference relations such as (interval) linguistic preference relations [7,13,63,64], and intuitionistic preference relations [43,45].
