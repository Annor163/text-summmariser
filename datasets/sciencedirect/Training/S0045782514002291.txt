@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the extension of the Nitsche method to the case of fluid–structure interaction problems on unfitted meshes. We give a stability analysis for the space semi-discretized problem and show how this estimate may be used to derive optimal error estimates for smooth solutions, irrespectively of the mesh/interface intersection. We also discuss different strategies for the time discretization, using either fully implicit or explicit coupling (loosely coupled) schemes. Some numerical examples illustrate the theoretical discussion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of Nitsche’s method for the coupling of multiphysics problems in computational mechanics has received increasing attention recently (see, e.g.,  [1]). Thanks to its flexibility and the mathematical soundness it has been used to design methods for several problems. Examples include XFEM of elasticity, i.e., interface problems on unfitted meshes  [2,3], and robust and accurate fictitious domain methods  [4]. Nitsche’s method was first applied to fluid–structure interaction problems in the framework of space–time Galerkin methods in  [5] and used to design stable loosely coupled fluid–structure interaction methods in  [6,7]. The objective of this note is to apply these techniques to design a computational method for fluid–structure interaction on unfitted meshes. The use of fictitious domain or immersed boundary methods for the numerical simulation of fluid–structure interaction problems was pioneered in the works  [8–11] and has recently seen a surge of interest in papers such as  [12–14].Our contribution in the present paper is to show how Nitsche’s method can be used for fluid–structure computations on unfitted meshes. We consider a low Reynolds regime (Stokes flow) and assume that the structure undergoes infinitesimal displacements (fixed interface). Though simplified, this setting retains some of the main numerical issues that appear in the time-stepping of complex non-linear incompressible fluid–structure interaction problems (see, e.g.,  [15]). We study both the case where the fluid and the solid equations are defined in domains ofRdand the case where the fluid is coupled to a thin-walled solid, with the solid equations written in the(d−1)-manifold defined by the fluid–solid interface. We present a rigorous proof that optimal convergence in energy norm is obtained for smooth solutions in the space semi-discretized case. Then we discuss different strategies for the time discretization, either fully implicit or the loosely coupled schemes introduced in  [6,7].We will study the case where the solid body is meshed and fitted to the interface. The main motivation for this is the fact that solids are generally described in Lagrangian coordinates and, hence, it is straightforward to move the mesh according to the deformation. This deformed solid mesh is then glued onto the fluid domain without respecting the mesh on the fluid side. This approach is similar to that proposed in  [16] for the Poisson problem and more recently in  [17] for Stokes’ equations. The heterogeneous character of the present system however leads to some difficulties compared to these works. The Nitsche method uses explicit integration of normal stress on the interface to ensure consistency. Since the stress is continuous the stress may be taken from either the solid or the fluid system. Indeed in  [16], robustness is ensured by taking all the stresses on the side where the mesh is conforming. This choice is convenient in the homogeneous case, but appears not to be so appealing in the case of fluid–structure interaction. The reason for this is that there is no dissipative mechanism in the solid elastodynamic system that can absorb the perturbation induced by the boundary stresses on the solid side.If, on the other hand, the Nitsche mortaring is taken only from the fluid side as proposed in  [5], the trace inequality necessary for the analysis is no longer robust and the penalty parameter may have to be chosen very large for unfortunate cuts of the mesh, or the resulting system matrix may turn out to be close to singular. In order to nevertheless design a robust and accurate method we suggest to use a ghost penalty term in the fluid (see  [18,19] where this technique was proposed for fictitious domain methods for Stokes’ problem) in order to extend the coercivity to all of the mesh domain. This is a weakly consistent stabilization term that extends theH1-stability of the viscous dissipation, as well as the control of the fluid pressure, to the whole fluid mesh-domain, i.e., also to parts of cut elements that are outside the physical domain. We prove that this is sufficient for the method to be stable and optimally convergent.It should be noted that, even though it appears non-physical, a similar analysis as the one presented below may be carried out if the stresses in the Nitsche coupling terms are taken on the solid side, provided that the solid equations are set inRd. This requires the use of Gronwall’s inequality and leads to the appearance of an unspecified time scale in the Nitsche penalty parameter. Furthermore this approach is not feasible when thin-walled solids are considered and is very inconvenient for nonlinear elasticity. It will therefore not be discussed further herein.An outline of the paper is as follows. In Section  2 we present a model problem for the fluid–structure interaction and the associated variational formulation. A Nitsche fictitious domain spatial discretization of the problem is proposed in Section  3. Stability and optimal convergence for smooth solutions is proven for this space semi-discretized system in Sections  3.1–3.3. Section  4 is devoted to time discretization, using either implicit or explicit coupling procedures. In Section  5 we present some numerical examples on a two-dimensional model problem. The performance of the fitted and the unfitted methods is compared. We investigate also the accuracy of the explicit coupling schemes proposed. Finally, Section  6 is dedicated to some concluding remarks.The physical domain consists ofΩ=defΩf∪Ωs∪Σ⊂Rd, withd=2or 3,Ωf,Ωsthe fluid and solid subdomains, respectively, andΣ=defΩf¯∩Ωs¯the fluid–solid interface. The exterior unit-vectors normal to∂Ωfand∂Ωsare denoted bynandns. We consider partitions∂Ωf=Γf∪Σand∂Ωs=Γs∪Σof the fluid and solid boundaries. The fluid is described by the Stokes equations in the polyhedral domainΩf. For the structure we consider two cases, either the elastodynamics equations inΩs⊂Rdor the elastodynamic equations for a thin-walled structure (string, membrane or shell) posed on the(d−1)-manifoldΣ. In the latter caseΩs¯=Σ¯andΓs=∂Σ.The considered coupled problem reads as follows: find the fluid velocityu:Ωf×R+→Rdand the fluid pressurep:Ωf×R+→R, satisfied inΩf, the solid displacementd:Ωs×R+→Rdand the solid velocityḋ:Ωs×R+→Rdsuch that(1){ρf∂tu−divσ(u,p)=0inΩf,divu=0inΩf,u=0onΓf,,(2){ḋ=∂tdinΩs,ρs∂tḋ−divσs(d)=0inΩs,d=0onΓs,(3){u=ḋonΣ,σ(u,p)n=−σs(d)nsonΣ.Here,ρfandρsrespectively denote the fluid and solid densities. The fluid Cauchy-stress tensor is given byσ(u,p)=def−pI+2μϵ(u),ϵ(u)=def12(∇u+∇uT),whereμstands for the fluid dynamic viscosity andIthe identity matrix inRd. The solid stress tensor is given byσs(d)=def2L1ϵ(d)+L2(divd)I,whereL1,L2>0stand for the Lamé constants of the structure. This system of equations is complemented with the initial conditionsu(0)=u0,d(0)=d0,ḋ(0)=ḋ0.In the case of the coupling with a thin-walled structure, the relations (2)–(3) are replaced by(4){u=ḋinΣ,ρsϵ∂tḋ+Led=−σ(u,p)ninΣ,ḋ=∂tdinΣ,d=0onΓs,whereLedenotes an elasticity operator defined on the(d−1)-manifoldΣandϵdenotes the thickness of the structure. Note that(4)2simultaneously enforces the kinetic continuity and the momentum equilibrium in the solid. Well-posedness results for this type of linear fluid–structure interaction problems can be found in  [20,21].In what follows, we will consider the usual Sobolev spacesHm(ω)(m≥0), with norm‖⋅‖m,ωand semi-norm|⋅|m,ω. For a given partΓ⊂∂ωof∂ω, the closed subspaceHΓ1(ω), consisting of functions inH1(ω)with zero trace onΓ, will be used. The scalar product inL2(ω)is denoted by(⋅,⋅)ωand its norm by‖⋅‖0,ω.For the weak formulation of the solid system (2) we introduce the space of admissible displacementsW=def[HΓs1(Ωs)]dand the elastic bi-linear formae:W×W→Rdefined byae(d,w)=def2L1(ϵ(d),ϵ(w))Ωs+L2(divd,divw)Ωs,for alld,w∈W. In the case of a thin-walled structure the elastic bilinear form is simply defined as the weak form of the differential surface operatorLe, that we assume to be symmetric, coercive and continuous onW. An example will be given in Section  5. We define the elastic energy norm by‖w‖e=defae(w,w)12. We also introduce the fluid velocity and pressure functional spacesV=def[HΓf1(Ωf)]d,Q=defL2(Ωf). Finally, the standard bi-linear forms for the Stokes problem,a:V×V→Randb:Q×V→R, given bya(u,v)=def2μ(ϵ(u),ϵ(v))Ωf,b(q,v)=def−(q,divv)Ωf,will be used.Let{Ths}0<h≤1denote a family of triangulations ofΩs. The meshesThsare fitted toΩs. Then consider a family of meshes{Thf}0<h≤1, where eachThfcovers the fluid regionΩf,Thf⊂Ωfand is fitted to the Dirichlet boundariesΓf, but in general not toΣ. Instead we assume that for every simplexK∈Thfthere holdsK∩Ωf≠0̸(see Fig. 1). We have, in particular,Ωs¯=⋃K∈Ths,Ωf¯⊊⋃K∈Thf.We will denote byΩThfthe set ofRdcoinciding withThf, that is,ΩThf¯=def∪K∈Thf. For each triangulationTh, the subscripth∈(0,1]refers to the level of refinement of the triangulation, which is defined byh=defmaxK∈ThhK, withhKthe diameter ofK. In order to simplify the presentation, we assume that the families of triangulations are quasi-uniform.We will use the following discrete semi-norms on function values on the interfaceΣ,‖u‖±12,h,Σ=def(∑{K∈Thf:K∩Σ≠0̸}∫K∩ΣhK∓1|u|2)12.We also note that the following trace inequality holds for all functions inH1(K). There existsCT>0such that for the intersection of the polygonal/polyhedral surfaceΣwith an elementKthere holds(5)‖u‖0,K∩Σ≤CT(h−12‖u‖0,K+h12‖∇u‖0,K).For shape regular elements, the proof of this result is equivalent to that of the standard trace inequality.In what follows, we consider the standard spaces of continuous piecewise affine functions:(6)Xhf=def{vh∈C0(ΩThf¯)/vh|K∈P1(K)∀K∈Thf},Xhs=def{vh∈C0(Ωs¯)/vh|K∈P1(K)∀K∈Ths}.For the approximation of the fluid velocity we will consider the spaceVh=def{vh∈[Xhf]d/vh|Γf=0}and for the pressure we will useQh=defXhf. Observe that forqh∈Qhwe haveqh|Ωf∈Q. For the solid we setWh=def[Xhs]d∩W.Since our choice of velocity and pressure spaces does not satisfy the inf–sup condition, we will consider a pressure stabilization in the form of an operatorsh:Qh×Qh↦Rin the mass equation below. We assume that the pressure stabilization operator,sp:Qh×Qh→R, satisfies(7)c1μ−1h2|ph|1,ΩThf2≤sh(ph,ph)≤c2μ−1h2|ph|1,ΩThf2,withc1,c2>0. For instance, the classical Brezzi–Pitkäranta pressure stabilization  [22] may be used on the following form(8)sh(ph,qh)=defγp∫ΩTfh2μ∇ph⋅∇qh,γp>0.Observe that the pressure stabilization is defined over the computational fluid domainΩTf. This feature is crucial to ensure stability for the coupling over the unfitted boundary. To counter instabilities due to the cut meshes we introduce a penalty term on the fluid velocities as well,gh:Vh×Vh→R, we assume that this operator is designed so that the following stability holds:(9)c̃s(μ‖ϵ(vh)‖0,ΩThf2+gh(vh,vh))≤μ‖ϵ(vh)‖0,Ωf2+gh(vh,vh)for allvh∈Vhand withc̃s>0(see  [18] for examples of suitable operators and a proof). The role ofghis to extend the coercivity from the fluid domainΩfto the computational domainΩThf. This feature allows us to prove robust error estimates independent of the mesh interface intersection. Note that the velocity stabilization only is needed in the interface zone and can in principle even be localized to elementsKfor whichΩf∩Kis small.We denote the total fluid stabilization by(10)Sh((uh,ph),(vh,qh))=defsh(ph,qh)+gh(uh,vh),with associated semi-norm|(uh,ph)|S=defSh((uh,ph),(uh,ph))12. The proposed space semi-discrete approximation of the systems given by (1)–(3) or (1) and (1)–(4) reads as follows: fort>0, find(uh(t),ph(t),ḋh(t),dh(t))∈Vh×Qh×Wh×Wh,such thatḋh(t)=∂tdh(t)and(11){ρf(∂tuh,vh)Ωf+A((uh,ph),(vh,qh))+ρs(∂tḋh,wh)Ωs+ae(dh,wh)−(σ(uh,ph)n,(vh−wh))Σ−((uh−ḋh),σ(vh,−qh)n)Σ+γμh((uh−ḋh),(vh−wh))Σ+Sh((uh,ph),(vh,qh))=0for all(vh,qh,wh)∈Vh×Qh×Wh. Here, we have used the notationA((uh,ph),(vh,qh))=defa(uh,vh)+b(ph,vh)−b(qh,uh)andγ>0is the Nitsche penalty parameter.Remark 3.1Note that the integrals in the bilinear forms corresponding to the fluid model are evaluated over the physical domainΩf. This means that, in practice, numerical quadrature has to be performed over the parts of the triangles that intersect the physical fluid domain. This is a non-standard implementational problem that has been discussed in  [23].Remark 3.2Note that the fluid mass matrix may be poorly conditioned if some nodes have macroelements with very small intersection with the physical domain. The space discretization operator of the fluid system however will have a condition number that is uniform in the mesh-interface intersection (see  [17] for a proof) and therefore ill-conditioning of the mass matrix is unlikely to have any impact on the full system, except for very small time-step. This problem can be eliminated using diagonal scaling or alternatively the mass matrix can be stabilized as well using an operator similar togh(⋅,⋅), to extend theL2-stability to the computational domainΩThf. This only requires a modification of the parameter ofgh(⋅,⋅).The next lemma states a result giving the coercivity inΩThfof the discretization of Stokes’ system.Lemma 3.1Forγ>0sufficiently large, there existscs>0such thatcs(μ‖∇vh‖0,ΩTf2+γμ‖vh−wh‖12,h,Σ2+|(vh,qh)|S2)≤A((vh,qh),(vh,qh))−(σ(vh,qh)n,(vh−wh))Σ−(σ(vh,−qh)n,vh−wh)Σ+γμh(vh−wh,vh−wh)Σ+|(vh,qh)|S2for all(vh,qh)∈Vh×Qhandwh∈Wh.ProofNote thatA((vh,ph),(vh,ph))−(σ(vh,ph)n,(vh−wh))Σ−(σ(vh,−ph)n,vh−wh)Σ+γμh(vh−wh,vh−wh)Σ+|(vh,ph)|S2=2μ‖ϵ(vh)‖0,Ωf2−2(σ(vh,0)n,(vh−wh))Σ+γμ‖vh−wh‖12,h,Σ2+|(vh,ph)|S2.We now observe that, by combining (5) with a discrete inverse inequality, it follows that(σ(vh,0)n,vh−wh)Σ≤2CTIγ12μ12‖ϵ(vh)‖0,ΩThfγ12μ12‖vh−wh‖12,h,Σ,withCTI>0. Finally, we conclude by using an arithmetic–geometric inequality with suitable weights, the stability estimate (9), Korn’s inequality and takingγsufficiently large.□If we takevh=uh,qh=phandwh=ḋhin (11) and apply the result of Lemma 3.1 we get the following energy inequality:(12)ddt(ρf2‖uh‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ḋh‖0,Ωs2+ae(dh,dh))+cs(μ‖∇uh‖0,ΩThf2+γμ‖uh−ḋh‖12,h,Σ2+|(uh,ph)|S2)≤0,which guarantees the energy stability of the unfitted space semi-discrete approximation (11).If we multiply (1) byvh,qh∈Vh×Qhand (2) bywh∈Wh, integrate by parts in both systems and use(3)2, we obtain the equalityρf(∂tu,vh)Ωf+A((u,p),(vh,qh))+ρs(∂tḋ,wh)Ωs+ae(d,wh)−(σ(u,p)n,(vh−wh))Σ=0.The same result is obtained for (1), (4), this time with the coupling conditions given in(4)2. Hence, owing to(3)1or(4)1, we may write(13)ρf(∂tu,vh)Ωf+A((u,p),(vh,qh))+ρs(∂tḋ,wh)Ωs+ae(d,wh)−(σ(u,p)n,(vh−wh))Σ−((u−ḋ),σ(vh,−qh)n)Σ+γμh((u−ḋ),(vh−wh))Σ=0for allvh,qh,wh∈Vh×Qh×Wh. Taking the difference between (13) and (11) we obtain the following result.Lemma 3.2Galerkin OrthogonalityLet(u,p,ḋ,d)be the solution of   (1),   (2),   (3)   or   (1),   (4)   and(uh,ph,ḋh,dh)be given by   (11). The following approximate Galerkin orthogonality holds:(14)ρf(∂t(u−uh),vh)Ωf+A((u−uh,p−ph),(vh,qh))+ρs(∂t(ḋ−ḋh),wh)Ωs+ae(d−dh,wh)−(σ(u−uh,p−ph)n,(vh−wh))Σ−((u−uh)−(ḋ−ḋh),σ(vh,−qh)n)Σ+γμh((u−uh)−(ḋ−ḋh),(vh−wh))Σ=Sh((uh,ph),(vh,qh))for allvh,qh,wh∈Vh×Qh×Whandt>0.In the succeeding text, the symbol≲indicates inequalities up to a multiplicative constant (independent of the discretization parameterhand the mesh/interface intersection). Furthermore, we assume that the elements in the solid mesh with faces in the solid trace mesh onΣmay be grouped in disjoint macropatchesPi, withmeas(Pi)=O(hd)in the case of a thick-walled solid andmeas(Pi)=O(hd−1)for a thin-walled solid. The restriction of the patchPitoΣwill be denoted byFi=defPi∩Σ. In the case of thin-walled solids we havePi≡Fi. Each(d−1)-dimensional macropatchFiis assumed to contain at least one interior node and the union of theFiis assumed to coverΣ, viz.,∪iFi=Σ.We introduce the discrete solid errorsξh=defdh−πhed,ξ̇h=defḋh−IhḋinΩs,whereπhestands for the elastic Ritz-projection of the solid, viz.,ae(d−πhed,wh)=0for allwh∈Wh. We assume that the solid is convex so that‖πhed−d‖0,Ωs≲h2|d|2,Ωs2. The interpolation operatorIhis defined byIhḋ=defπheḋ+∑iαiφi,withαi∈R. Theφiare functions with support in the patchesPi, such that0≤φi≤1, with‖φi‖0,Pi≲hd2for the thick-walled solid case and‖φi‖0,Pi≲hd−12for the thin-walled solid case. The functionφitakes the value 1, component-wise, in the interior nodes of the associated interface patchFi. The associatedαiare chosen so that(15)∫Fi(ḋ−Ihḋ)⋅n=0.For details on the construction ofφiwe refer to  [24].We now assume that there exist two linear continuous lifting operatorsE2:H2(Ωf)→H2(Rd)andE1:H1(Ωf)→H1(Rd), satisfying the bounds‖E1v‖H1(Rd)≲‖v‖H1(Ωf)for allv∈H1(Ωf)and‖E2v‖H2(Rd)≲‖v‖H2(Ωf)for allv∈H2(Ωf). Using these lifting operators (component wise) we introduce the discrete errors for the fluidθh=defuh−iszE2u,yh=defph−iszE1pinΩThf,whereiszis defined by the Scott–Zhang interpolant (see, e.g.,  [25]). We assume that the stabilization operator defined in (10) satisfies the following weak consistency property(16)|(iszE2u,iszE1p)|S≲h(μ12|u|2,Ωf+μ−12|p|1,Ωf).For a proof of this property for the velocity part we refer to  [4]. The pressure part is an immediate consequence of (7), theH1-stability of the Scott–Zhang interpolant and the stability of the extension operatorE1,sh(iszE1p,iszE1p)12≲μ−12h|iszE1p|1,ΩThf≲μ−12h|E1p|1,ΩThf≲μ−12h|p|1,Ωf.The remaining necessary approximation estimates for these interpolants are collected in the following lemma.Lemma 3.3Assume thatu∈[H2(Ωf)]d,p∈H1(Ωf)andd,ḋ∈[H2(Ωs)]d. The following approximation estimates hold:‖u−iszE2u‖0,Ωf+h‖∇(u−iszE2u)‖0,Ωf≲h2|u|2,Ωf,‖p−iszE1p‖0,Ωf+h‖∇(p−iszE1p)‖0,Ωf≲h|p|1,Ωf,‖d−πhed‖0,Ωs+h‖∇(d−πhed)‖0,Ωs≲h2|d|2,Ωs,‖ḋ−Ihḋ‖0,Ωs+h‖∇(ḋ−Ihḋ)‖0,Ωs≲h2|ḋ|2,Ωs,‖σ(u−iszE2u,p−iszE1p)n‖−12,h,Σ≲h(‖u‖2,Ωf+‖p‖1,Ωf),‖(u−iszE2u)−(ḋ−Ihḋ)‖12,h,Σ≲h(‖u‖2,Ωf+‖ḋ‖2,Ωs).ProofWe only discuss the proof of the three last estimates, since the other estimates follow using standard approximation theory and the stability of the extension operator. By the construction ofIhwe have,αi=∫Fi(ḋ−πheḋ)⋅n∫Fiφi⋅n.Sinceh(d−1)≲|∫Fiφi⋅n|andmeas(Fi)=O(hd−1), we have(17)∑i|αi|2≲∑i(|∫Fi(ḋ−πheḋ)⋅n|h(d−1))2≲h1−d∑i‖ḋ−πheḋ‖0,Fi2.Therefore, for the thick-walled solid, there holds(18)∑i|αi|2≲h4−d|ḋ|2,Ωs2,where the last inequality follows from (5) and the approximation properties ofπhe. For the thin-walled solid case, thanks to the approximation properties ofπhe, we get(19)∑i|αi|2≲h5−d|ḋ|2,Ωs2.Hence, for the thick-walled solid, it follows that‖ḋ−Ihḋ‖0,Ωs≤‖ḋ−πheḋ‖0,Ωs+(∑i‖αiφi‖0,Pi2)12≲h2|ḋ|2,Ωs+(hd∑i|αi|2)12and we conclude by applying (18). Whereas, for the thin-walled solid, we have‖ḋ−Ihḋ‖0,Ωs≤‖ḋ−πheḋ‖0,Ωs+(∑i‖αiφi‖0,Pi2)12≲h2|ḋ|2,Ωs+(hd−1∑i|αi|2)12and the result follows using (19).The estimate for‖∇(ḋ−Ihḋ)‖0,Ωsfollows similarly, by using a discrete inverse inequality inPi.For the error estimates on the traceΣ, note that we have‖σ(u−iszE2u,p−iszE1p)n‖−12,h,Σ≲h12(‖∇(u−iszE2u)‖0,Σ+‖p−iszE1p‖0,Σ),‖(u−iszE2u)−(ḋ−Ihḋ)‖12,h,Σ≲h−12(‖u−iszE2u‖0,Σ+‖ḋ−Ihḋ‖0,Σ).The quantities on the solid side where the mesh is fitted to interface are treated in a standard fashion using element-wise trace inequalities, followed by approximation in the case of a thick-walled solid and approximation only in the case of a thin-walled solid.We will detail the estimates for quantities on the unfitted mesh. Using the trace inequality (5) element-wise, for all elements intersected by the interface, we haveh12‖∇(u−iszE2u)‖0,Σ+h−12‖u−iszE2u‖0,Σ≲h|E2u|2,ΩThf+‖∇(u−iszE2u)‖0,ΩThf+h−1‖u−iszE2u‖0,ΩThf≲h|E2u|2,ΩThf≲h|u|2,Ωf,where the last inequality is a consequence of the stability of the extension operator. Similarly we may estimate the trace error of the pressure in the following fashionh12‖p−iszE1p‖0,Σ≲h‖∇(E1p−iszE1p)‖0,ΩThf+‖E1p−iszE1p‖0,ΩTf≲h|E1p|1,ΩThf≲h|p|1,Ωf,which concludes the proof.□By using Lemma 3.1, we get the following energy estimate for the discrete errorsθh,yh,ξ̇h,ξh:(20)ρf2‖θh(t)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(t)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(t)‖e2+cs∫0t[μ‖∇θh‖0,ΩThf2+γμ‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2+|(θh,yh)|S2+ae(ξh,ξ̇h−∂tξh)]≤ρf2‖θh(0)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(0)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(0)‖e2+∫0t[ρf(∂tθh,θh)Ωf+ρs(∂tξ̇h,ξ̇h)Ωs+|(θh,yh)|S2+A((θh,yh),(θh,yh))−(σ(θh,yh)n,(θh−ξ̇h))Σ−(σ(θh,−yh)n,θh−ξ̇h)Σ+γμh(θh−ξ̇h,θh−ξ̇h)Σ+ae(ξh,ξ̇h)].Observe that due to the different definition of the interpolation operators inξhandξ̇h, it does not hold thatξ̇h=∂tξh. Therefore to obtain the above inequality we used the fact that12‖ξh(t)‖e2−12‖ξh(0)‖e2+∫0tae(ξh,ξ̇h−∂tξh)=∫0tae(ξh,ξ̇h).This results in a non-positive contributionae(ξh,ξ̇h−∂tξh)in the left-hand side of (20) which will be treated as an approximation error in the error analysis below. Note that the pressure is only controlled in the weak norm given by the stabilization operator.For the purpose of the analysis, it is convenient to denote the approximation errors byθπ=defE2u−iszE2u,yπ=defE1p−iszE1pinΩThf,ξπ=defd−πed,ξ̇π=defḋ−IhḋinΩs.We are now ready to state and prove our main convergence result.Theorem 3.1Let(u,p,ḋ,d)be the solution of   (1),   (2),   (3)   or   (1),   (4)   and(uh,ph,ḋh,dh)be given by(11). Assume that the exact solution(u,p,ḋ,d)has the regularity required by the approximation results ofLemma  3.3   and thatγ>0is given byLemma  3.1. Fort>0, there holds:ρf2‖(uh−u)(t)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖(ḋh−ḋ)(t)‖0,Ωs2+12‖(dh−d)(t)‖e2+cs∫0t[μ‖∇(uh−u)‖0,Ωf2+γμ‖uh−ḋh‖12,h,Σ2]≲h2.ProofBy a triangle inequality and the optimal approximability of the proposed interpolants it is sufficient to prove the convergence of the discrete error(θh,yh,ξ̇h,ξh). Consider first the inequality (20). After applying the Galerkin orthogonality (14) in the right-hand side and noting that by the definition ofπhe,ae(ξπ,ξ̇h)=0, we have(21)ρf2‖θh(t)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(t)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(t)‖e2+cs∫0t[μ‖∇θh‖0,ΩTf2+γμ‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2+|(θh,yh)|S2]≤ρf2‖θh(0)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(0)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(0)‖e2+∫0t[(∂tθπ,θh)Ωf+(∂tξ̇π,ξ̇h)︸T1+Sh((iszE2u(t),iszE1p(t)),(θh,yh))︸T2A((θπ,yπ),(θh,yh))−(σ(θπ,yπ)n,(θh−ξ̇h))Σ−(σ(θh,yh)n,θπ−ξ̇π)Σ︸T3+γμh(θπ−ξ̇π,θh−ξ̇h)Σ︸T4−ae(ξh,ξ̇h−∂tξh)︸T5].We may now bound the termsT1,…,T5term by term. Mainly by applying Cauchy–Schwarz inequality followed by trace inequalities and approximation. For the first term we have∫0tT1≤ρf‖∂tθπ‖L2(0,t;Ωf)‖θh‖L2(0,t;Ωf)+‖∂tξ̇π‖L2(0,t;Ωf)‖ξ̇h‖L2(0,t;Ωs)≤Ch4(ρf‖∂tu‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+ρs‖∂tḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2)+ρf‖θh‖L2(0,t;Ωf)2+ρs‖ξ̇h‖L2(0,t;Ωs)2.The two first terms in the right-hand side have optimal convergence order and the last two may be controlled using Gronwall’s lemma.ForT2we observe that∫0tT2≤12cs∫0t|iszE2u(t),iszE1p(t)|S2+cs2∫0t|(θh,yh)|S2,where the second term in the right-hand side is absorbed in the left-hand side of (21) and the first term is bounded using the approximation (16).To estimateT3we first note that the second term in the expression is bounded by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality followed by approximation(22)∫0t|(σ(θπ,yπ)n,(θh−ξ̇h))Σ|≤Ch2(|u|L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+|p|L2(0,t;H1(Ωf))2)+cs4γμ∫0t‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2.We then consider the velocity part and observe that(23)∫0t(a(θπ,θh)−(σ(θh,0)n,θπ−ξ̇π)Σ)≤Ch2(‖u‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+‖ḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2)+cs2μ∫0t‖∇θh‖0,ΩTf2.The pressure velocity coupling is the most interesting part of the continuity. For the remaining terms ofT3we write, using an integration by parts in the mass conservation equation,(24)b(yπ,θh)−b(yh,θπ)−(σ(0,−yh)n,θπ−ξ̇π)Σ=(yπ,∇⋅θh)Ωf−(yh,∇⋅θπ)Ωf−(σ(0,−yh)n,θπ−ξ̇π)Σ=(yπ,∇⋅θh)Ωf︸T31−(∇yh,θπ)Ωf︸T32−(σ(0,yh)n,ξ̇π)Σ︸T33.Estimating the termsT31andT32we get∫0tT31≤Ch2|p|L2(0,t;H1(Ωf))2+cs4μ∫0t‖∇θh‖0,Ωf2,∫0tT32≤Ch2‖u‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+cs8∫0t|(0,yh)|S2.Denoting byyithe average ofyhover the interface patchFiwe obtain, using the property (15) of the interpolantIh,(25)T33=∑iinfyi∈R(yh−yi,ξ̇π⋅n)Fi≤C‖h∇yh‖0,ΩThfh|ḋ|2,Ωs≤cs8|(0,yh)|S2+Ch2|ḋ|2,Ωs2.The boundary penalty termT4is handled using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality followed by approximation,(26)∫0tT4≤1csγμ∫0t‖θπ−ξ̇π‖12,h,Σ2+cs4γμ∫0t‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2≤1csγμh2(‖u‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+‖ḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2)+cs4γμ∫0t‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2.Note that the first term has the right convergence order and the second term can be absorbed in the left-hand side of (21).Finally, termT5is bounded using the fact thatξ̇h−∂tξh=∑iαiφiand the convergence order of the perturbation is known (cf., the bound (17)),∫0tT5=∫0tae(ξh,ξ̇h−∂tξh)=∑i∫0tae(ξh,αiφi)≤∑i∫0t‖ξh‖e‖αiφi‖1,Ωs≲∫0t‖ξh‖e2+h2‖ḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2.We may now collect the above bounds to obtain the boundρf2‖θh(t)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(t)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(t)‖e2+cs4∫0t[μf‖∇θh‖0,ΩTf2+γμ‖θh−ξ̇h‖12,h,Σ2+|(θh,yh)|S2]≤ρf2‖θh(0)‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ξ̇h(0)‖0,Ωs2+12‖ξh(0)‖e2+Cth4(ρf‖∂tu‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+ρs‖∂tḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2)+Cth2(|u|L2(0,t;H2(Ωf))2+|p|L2(0,t;H1(Ωf))2+‖ḋ‖L2(0,t;H2(Ωs))2)+t−1(ρf‖θh‖L2(0,t;Ωf)2+ρs‖ξ̇h‖L2(0,t;Ωs)2+∫0t‖ξh‖e2).We conclude the proof by applying Gronwall’s lemma.□This section is devoted to the time discretization of the space semi-discrete formulation (11). Both implicit and explicit coupling strategies are discussed. In the subsequent text, the parameterτ>0stands for the time-step length,tn=defnτ, forn∈Nand∂τxn=def(xn−xn−1)/τfor the first-order backward difference. We also introduce the fluid discrete bi-linear formahf((uh,ph),(vh,qh))=defA((uh,ph),(vh,qh))+Sh((uh,ph),(vh,qh)).An overall implicit first-order scheme is considered for the time-discretization of (11). This yields the time-advancing procedure reported in Algorithm 1.Note that at each time leveln, the fluid(uhn,phn)and solid(ḋhn,dhn)states are fully coupled. The next result states the unconditional stability of the implicit scheme given by (27), and whereEn=defρf2‖uhn‖0,Ωf2+ρs2‖ḋhn‖0,Ωs2+ae(dhn,dhn),denotes the total energy of the discrete system a timetn.Lemma 4.1Let{(uhn,phn,ḋhn,dhn)}n≥1be the sequence given by Algorithm  1. Then, under the conditionCTI2≲γ, there holdsEn≤E0for alln≥1.ProofThe result is a straightforward consequence of Lemma 3.1, after taking(vh,qh,wh)=(uhn,phn,ḋhn)in (27).□In this paragraph we introduce time-marching procedures that allow an uncoupled computation of the fluid(uhn,phn)and solid(ḋhn,dhn)states (explicit coupling schemes). Basically, the proposed methods generalized the Nitsche-based splitting schemes, introduced in  [6,7], to the unfitted framework provided by (11). To this purpose, we first note that the monolithic problem (11) can be equivalently formulated in terms of two coupled sub-problems: fort>0•Solid sub-problem: find(ḋh(t),dh(t))∈Wh×Whwithḋh(t)=∂tdh(t)and such that(28)ρs(∂tḋh,wh)Ωs+ae(dh,wh)+γμh(ḋh,wh)Σ=−γμh(uh,wh)Σ−(σ(uh,ph)n,wh)Σfor allwh∈Wh.Fluid sub-problem: find(uh(t),ph(t))∈Vh×Qhsuch that(29)ρf(∂tuh,vh)Ωf+ahf((uh,ph),(vh,qh))−((uh−ḋh),σ(vh,−qh)n)Σ+γμh(uh,vh)Σ=γμh(ḋh,vh)Σ+(σ(uh,ph)n,vh)Σfor all(vh,qh)∈Vh×Qh.Following  [6,7], we propose to uncouple the time-marching of (28) and (29) through the explicit treatment of the interface fluid terms in (28), as detailed in Algorithm 2. Note that, in the fluid sub-step (31), the interface fluid stress is explicitly treated. This explains why the symmetrizing viscous term((uhn−ḋhn),σ(vh,0)n)Σ,is missing in (31). The weakly consistent interface pressure stabilization,γ0hγμ(phn−phn−1,qh)Σ,γ0>0,is introduced to control the artificial interface pressure fluctuations induced by the splitting of pressure stress in time.The next result guarantees the conditional stability of Algorithm 2.Lemma 4.2Let{(uhn,phn,ḋhn,dhn)}n≥1be the sequence given by Algorithm  2. Then, under the following conditions,CTI2≲γ,γτ≲h,1≲γ0,En≲E0+μ‖uh0‖0,Σ2+μ‖ϵ(uh0)‖0,Ωf2+γ0hγμτ‖ph0‖0,Σ2forn≥1.ProofThe result follows by combining Lemma 3.1 with the arguments reported in  [6, Section 5.1].□The main drawback of Algorithm 2 is its poor accuracy compared to Algorithm 1. In fact, the interface time splitting introduces a truncation error whose leading contribution is of the formO(τ/h), which prevents convergence under the stability conditions of Lemma 4.2. This error perturbation comes from explicit treatment of the penalty term in the right-hand side of (30). In order to retain overall first-order accuracy under the standard conditionτ=O(h)imposed by the stability, we propose to combine Algorithm 2 with an extrapolation/correction strategy (see  [7, Section 4.1]).The resulting procedure is detailed in Algorithm 3, whereK≥0indicates the number of correction steps. Here, we have used the notation∂τxn,k=(xn,k−xn−1)/τ. The purpose of the second-order extrapolation, in (32), is to retrieve a truncation error in the penalty term of the formO((τ2/h)K+1), afterK-correction iterations. Note that without any correction,(K=0), this contribution isO((τ2/h))and hence an overallO(h)is expected underτ=O(h). Numerical evidence shows, however, thatK≥1is required for stability.In order to illustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed schemes, we consider the widespread two-dimensional pressure-wave propagation benchmark (see, e.g.,  [26]). The fluid domain and the fluid–solid interface are, respectively,Ωf=(0,L)×(0,R),Σ=[0,L]×{R}, withL=6andR=0.5. A generalized string model is taken for the structure. HenceΩs¯=Σand in (4) we taked=(0η),Led=(0−λ1∂xxη+λ0η),λ1=defEϵ2(1+ν),λ0=defEϵR2(1−ν2).Then the elastic bi-linear form readsae(d,w)=defλ1(∂xη,∂xw)Σ+λ0(η,w)Σ,withw=(0,w)T. As usual, hereEdenotes the Young modulus andνthe Poisson ratio of the solid. All the quantities will be given in the CGS system. Atx=0we impose a sinusoidal pressure of maximal amplitude2×104during5⋅10−3s, corresponding to half a period. Zero pressure is enforced atx=6and a symmetry condition is applied on the lower wally=0. The solid is clamped at its extremities,x=0,L. The fluid physical parameters are given byρf=1.0,μ=0.035, while for the solid we haveρs=1.1,ϵ=0.1,E=0.75×106andν=0.5.Fig. 5 shows an example of unfitted and fitted fluid computational meshes considered in the computations. In the unfitted case, we haveΩThf=[0,6]×[0,0.8]and henceΩf¯⊂ΩThf. The ghost-penalty stabilization bi-linear form in (10) has been defined on the whole computational domain, that is,gh(uh,vh)=defγg∑K∈Thf∫∂K∖∂ΩThfμh〚∇uh〛∂K⋅〚∇vh〛∂K,where the symbol〚⋅〛Fdenotes the jump of given quantity across the edge or faceF. The free stabilization parameters have been set toγ=1000,γg=1andγp=10−3(in (8)). All the computations have been performed with FreeFem++  [27].In Fig. 6 we have reported a few snapshots of the pressure field obtained with Algorithm 1, takingτ=2⋅10−4andh=0.1. The numerical solution remains stable, as predicted by Lemma 4.1, and a propagating pressure-wave is observed. For comparison purposes, Fig. 7 reports the snapshots of the pressure obtained with a fitted method and interface matching discretizations. The good agreement of the two numerical solutions in the physical domainΩfis clearly visible. Similar conclusions can be inferred from Fig. 8, which reports the corresponding interface displacements att=0.015. The depicted reference solution has been generated using the fitted method with a high space–time grid resolution (h=3.125×10−3,τ=10−6).In order to highlight the overall accuracy of Algorithm 1, we have refined both in time and in space at the same rate,τ=O(h), with the following set of discrete parameters:(33)(τ,h)∈{2−i(2⋅10−4,0.1)}i=04.The coarsest discretization,i=0, corresponds to the results reported in Figs. 6 and 8. In Fig. 9, we have displayed the interface displacements obtained after successive space–time refinement,i=1,…,4. These results highlight the convergent behavior of Algorithm 1 and that, after a few space–time refinements, both the fitted and the unfitted methods yield practically the same accuracy.Fig. 2reports the convergence history of the solid displacement at timet=0.015, in the relative elastic energy-norm. The results show that Algorithm 1 retrieves the overall optimalO(h)accuracy of the fitted method. Note that, owing to Theorem 3.1, the accuracy of Algorithm 1 is expected to beO(τ)+O(h)in the energy norm. Hence, underτ=O(h)we retrieve the optimalO(h)rate observed in Fig. 2.We discuss now the explicit coupling procedures introduced in Section  4.2. These methods allow an uncoupled time-marching of the fluid and the solid sub-problems. Fig. 3shows the convergence histories of the solid displacement at timet=0.015, in the relative elastic energy-norm, obtained with Algorithms 1–3 withK=1. The non-convergent behavior of Algorithm 2 underτ=O(h)is striking, as anticipated in Section  4.2. On the other hand, Algorithm 3 with one correction step retrieves the overall optimalO(h)accuracy of the implicit coupling scheme (Algorithm 1). Similar observations can be inferred from Fig. 4,where we have reported the interface displacements obtained with the last four space–time refinements (i=1,…,4in (33)).
