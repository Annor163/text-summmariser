@&#ABSTRACT@&#
IntroductionSeveral studies have analysed the platelet parameters in human blood, nevertheless there are no extensive analyses on the less common platelet phenotypes. The main objective of our study is to evaluate the age and gender effects on 15 platelet phenotypes.MethodsWe studied 804 individuals, ranging in age from 2 to 93 years, included in the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia 2 (GAIT 2) Project. The 15 platelet phenotypes analysed were the platelets counts, platelet volumes, plateletcrits, immature platelet fraction (IPF) and platelet function assay (PFA). A regression-based method was used to evaluate the age and gender effects on these phenotypes.ResultsOur results were consistent with the previously reported results regarding platelet counts and plateletcrit (PCT). They showed a decrease with increasing age. The mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) increased with age, but did not present any gender effect. All the IPF phenotypes increased with age, whereas the PFA phenotypes did not show any relation to age or gender.DiscussionTo sum up, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the age and gender effects on the platelet phenotypes in a family-base sample. Our results suggest more reasonable age stratification into two distinct groups: childhood, ranging from 2 to 12 years, and the mature group, from 13 to 93 years. Moreover, the PFA phenotypes were maintained constant while the platelet counts, the MPV and IPF levels vary with age.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Platelets are anucleated blood cells that play an important role in different physiological functions such as haemostasis, wound healing and inflammation [1,2]. Their intrinsic features include size, metabolic capacity, ability to aggregate and relative short lifespan (8–10 days). These features determine their functional properties [3,4]. Megakaryocytes maintain the platelet population and functionality, producing about 1011 platelets per day [4,5].The haematological status of individuals is currently based on the assessment of different clinical phenotypes such as platelet counts, platelet volumes and plateletcrits [6–8]. These phenotypes are used to determine the thrombopoietic status of patients and quantitative variations in platelet phenotypes [9–11]. The platelet distribution width (PDW) describes how uniform the platelets are in size, and it has been proposed as a marker of platelet activation [7,12]. The platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR) is defined as the percentage of large platelet volume, and it has been associated with higher platelet reactivity and cardiovascular risk [13–15]. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) phenotypes are an indirect measurement of the reticulated platelets and the thrombopoiesis turnover [7,9,16,17]. The platelet function assay (PFA) phenotypes estimate the platelet function [18,19]. All of these platelet phenotypes are measured using either haematological analysers [6,8,9] or in vitro assays [19–21].In the healthy human population, normal platelet counts range from 150 to 400·109/L of whole blood [4,5,22]. The mean platelet volume (MPV) ranges from 7.8 to 11.0fL [23] and the reference PDW values range from 2 to 30fL [11]. The IPF values range from 0.70% to 6.1% or 8% [6,7,24]. These phenotypes have previously been studied with respect to the effects of age and gender [25–27]. Some studies have compared also many different haematological analysers [8,9,24,28], intervals of age [25,29,30], and the ethnicity or habitat [31–35]. There are also studies that have reported incomplete or partial analyses of the platelet blood count (PBC) [16,23,25].The main aim of our study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the influence of age and gender on 15 platelet phenotypes. An underlying aim is to determine statistical differences among the results obtained using two different automated haematological analysers on these 15 platelet phenotypes and, finally, our third aim was to develop a single statistical model to evaluate the age and gender effects on each these phenotypes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We used the LME model to study the effect of age and gender on 15 platelet phenotypes. Our results suggest that two age groups should be considered clinically: childhood, ranging from 2 to 12 years, and the mature group, from 13 to 93 years. Several studies have analysed several haematological parameters of the red and white blood counts [35,40], and the PBC [30,31,34,41], but there are few studies that analysed comprehensively how age and gender affect other platelet phenotypes, such us the IPF and PFA phenotypes.One of the first aims of the present study was to compare the measurements of the Sysmex XE-2100® and Sysmex KX-21N® analysers. The PLT, PLTOP, MPV and PCT have been analysed largely by the Sysmex XE-2100®[9,24]. However, there are few studies that analyse the PLT40, MPV40 and PCT40 obtained by the Sysmex KX-21N®[33,42]. The present study showed significant differences when measuring the same phenotypes with different analysers (PLT and PLT40, MPV and MPV40, and PCT and PCT40). The results obtained with the phenotypes assessed with both analysers were consistent.We found that all the platelet counts (PLT, PLTOP and PLT40) decrease with age (Fig. 1a). In accordance with previous studies [25,27,43], we also found that the PLT, PLTOP and PLT40 had higher counts in females than in males. An Italian study [25] estimated also that the PLT decreases in older ages more than 35% in men and 25% in women. It has been reported also that the MPV phenotype increases with age [6,23,44]. Besides the MVP, the other platelet volumes (PDW and P-LCR) and the IPF phenotypes, showed increased values with age, but had no gender effect (Fig. 1b). There are some studies [16,17,45] that define the mean and CI of IPF values in different ethnic populations such as Korean (3.4%, 1.1–6.1%), Japanese (3.3%, 1.0–10.3%) or Indian (2.1%, 0.3–8.7%) adults. In our study, the levels of IPF phenotypes (IPF%, IPF#, HIPF% and IPF-X) in the childhood group (Group 1) were significantly lower than the adulthood (Group 3) and elder (Group 4) groups. We also observed that the IPF% increase with age [16]. No gender effect in the adulthood group, unlike the Korean and European studies [9]. We did not observe either an age or a gender effect on PFA phenotypes (Fig. 2a and b), as it has been previously reported [19,21]. Our study in extended Spanish pedigrees of the 15 platelet phenotypes replicate earlier studies [16,25,30], and it provides a better understanding of the PBC behaviour throughout the life.We also performed a comprehensive analysis of the influence of age and gender on platelet function. In healthy population, the platelet dynamics have been characterized previously taking into account the effect of different covariates [22,25,30], analysing a single [25,33] or a few platelet phenotypes [23,27,29,34], such as the platelet counts, MPV or PCT phenotypes. These previous reports led us to the partition of the subjects into different age and gender groups. With this approach, we were able to replicate earlier studies [25,27]. Regarding other phenotypes, such as the IPF and PFA phenotypes, we report a novel regression-based model taking into account the effect of the age and gender. For instance, the IPF%, IPF# and IPF-X showed a similar dynamics than the MPV (Fig. 1b). Previous studies [14,16] in patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) reported high IPF values. Therefore, the IPF phenotypes are commonly used as markers to determine if the platelet production is abnormal in aplastic anaemia, with an IPF% mean value of 7.7% (range, 1.0–33.8%) 16]. It is also used to measure platelet over destruction in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), with an IPF mean value of 3.5% (range, 0.6–12.9%) [16]. Previous studies also have reported [25], thrombocytopenia in children or thrombocytosis in elders could be wrongly diagnosed. As a result of the present study, we propose a new partitioning strategy for the age group to study these 15 platelet phenotypes. In this study, statistically differences between the childhood (Group 1) and adulthood (Group 3) groups (Tables 5 and 7). Consequently, we suggest, under a practical point of view, to only consider two age groups clinically: childhood, ranging from 2 to 12 years, and the mature group, from 13 to 93 years.The platelet counts and MPV are the phenotypes most commonly analysed by the clinicians. Previous studies suggest that there is an inverse and non-linear correlation between the platelet counts and the mean platelet volume phenotypes [27,30,34]. We attempted to replicate these results, by means of a regression-based model that characterizes the platelet phenotypes according to different age groups (Fig. 1a and b). Our models estimated the relationship between each phenotype and an age group. We found that there was a tendency for the platelet counts to be higher in the childhood group than in the other age groups (Fig. 1a), while the MPV increased more abruptly in the childhood group (Fig. 1b).Although, the PFA-100® system is unspecific to any particular platelet disorder, it might be a useful screening test for the platelet dysfunction [19,46]. Thus, the measurement of the PFA phenotypes could be considered a proper global test system for primary haemostasis. The present study reports significant differences between the CT of the childhood (Group1) and adulthood (Group 3) groups for both PFA phenotypes, as previous study have reported [46]. In addition, any other statistical differences were observed among the other age groups for the PFAadp and PFAepi (Table 7). Thus, the non-linear and inverse correlation between both platelet phenotypes (platelet counts and MPV) might be explained by a biological trend to maintain invariably the platelet mass and the platelet function throughout the life of the individual [47] (Fig. 2a and b).Although we have confirmed previous findings, in the present work we report the results from a more comprehensive view of the platelet-related parameters and the platelet function, and its variation throughout the life of the individual. In addition, our study proposes a new approach to analyse a sample of related individuals (within extended Spanish pedigrees) by means of linear mixed regression models. We believe that the same approach should be considered for other study designs where the population stratification is an issue, for example, a sample measured among different geographical regions [25] or ethnic groups [26]. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that platelet function is maintained invariably over time.The authors report no conflicts of interest.
