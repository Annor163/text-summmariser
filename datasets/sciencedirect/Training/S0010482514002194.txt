BackgroundGraph theoretical analysis has recently become a popular research tool in neuroscience, however, there have been very few studies on brain responses to music perception, especially when culturally different styles of music are involved.MethodsElectroencephalograms were recorded from ten subjects listening to Chinese traditional music, light music and western classical music. For event-related potentials, phase coherence was calculated in the alpha band and then constructed into correlation matrices. Clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths were evaluated for global properties, while clustering coefficients and efficiency were assessed for local network properties.ResultsPerception of light music and western classical music manifested small-world network properties, especially with a relatively low proportion of weights of correlation matrices. For local analysis, efficiency was more discernible than clustering coefficient. Nevertheless, there was no significant discrimination between Chinese traditional and western classical music perception.ConclusionsPerception of different styles of music introduces different network properties, both globally and locally. Research into both global and local network properties has been carried out in other areas; however, this is a preliminary investigation aimed at suggesting a possible new approach to brain network properties in music perception.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the field of cognition and perception, many studies have investigated the effects of music on brain responses. Some examples of these studies include: comparisons of the similarities and shared processing foundations between music and language [1,2]; assessments of music helping to improve IQ or work efficiency [3–5]; investigations of translating electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms into music [6,7]; and reports on the effects of cultural styles on music perception [8–10]. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were the most studied electrophysiological responses (e.g., P600 responses to cross-cultural expectancy violations [11]). Some recent interesting studies investigating music perception include: observing the musical event-related synchronization/desynchronization phenomenon, classifying EEG responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music [12]; and comparing the network properties of EEG when listening to Guqin music and noise [13]. Network properties can be evaluated with graph theoretical analysis, which has recently been a popular tool in neuroscience since it could reveal the segregation and integration areas of the brain [14,15]. Graph theoretical analysis first became popular for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, and extended to various modalities of brain imaging techniques, such as EEG, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) [16], and magnetoencephalography (MEG) [17], among others. Graph theoretical analysis usually starts with the construction of a network consisting of vertices that are linked by edges. The vertices stand for elementary units, such as cortical areas or channels, while the edges represent associations between vertices. Regarding the associations, there are many choices, for instance, phase coherence, synchronization likelihood and phase lag index (PLI). Various properties can be calculated from the constructed network, such as clustering coefficient (the most elementary measures of local segregation), path length (an index reflecting the overall integration of the network), and efficiency (computed as the average of the inverse of the distance matrix), etc. In most cases, the functional brain would present as a ‘small world’, with a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length, which reflect efficient information spreading, rapid synchronization and low wiring cost [18,19]. However, brain network properties can be affected by many factors, such as age [20], disease [21–25] and alcohol [26], and can reflect different brain activities in different experimental tasks [27–29]. Therefore, graphic analysis is prevalently used to explore the coordination of cortical areas in many medical researches and cognition studies [17,23,30–32].There are only a few studies that use graph theoretical analysis to investigate brain dynamics related to music perception. Jäncke et al. found that people with absolute pitch tend to have increased degrees, clustering, and local efficiency of functional correlations (fMRI) [33], while Sänger et al. demonstrated that playing duets helped enhance the intra-and-between-brain small-world properties (EEG) [34]. Moreover, Varotto et al. made patients with diseases of consciousness listen to pleasant and unpleasant music, with the aim of discovering the differences of network properties compared with normal individuals (EEG). In the control group (six healthy subjects), an increase in the number of network connections was induced by pleasant music; however, clustering coefficient and path length were not affected by the stimuli. In the patient group (five vegetative state patients), two showed stronger synchronization during the unpleasant condition, and decreased values of clustering coefficient and path length during both musical stimuli [35]. Nevertheless, in regard to the perception of different music styles, there has been no study that uses graph theoretical analysis. In this study, the subjects listened to three styles of music: Chinese traditional, light and western classical music, and EEG data were measured. Because the above-mentioned studies proved that listening to Guqin music changed the brain network properties [13] and other fMRI studies found that different cultural music perception would activate different cortical areas [36], we assumed that processing different styles of music would also affect brain network connectivity properties. To test this hypothesis, graph theoretical analysis was applied. Functional connectivity at different electrodes was estimated using the phase coherence method. The whole brain was modeled as undirected weighted graphs for each subject, and then the network topology was investigated. We analyzed global and local network properties, since both of these are very important in network neuroscience [37]. Many of the previous studies [13,35] only assessed the global properties of network topology. In this study, we looked at the local properties, similar to Xue et al. [38].
