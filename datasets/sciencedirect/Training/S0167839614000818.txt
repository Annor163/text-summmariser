@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We show how to find four generic interpolants to aC1Hermite data-set in the complex representation, using Pythagorean-hodograph curves generated as cuts of degree(1,3)of Laurent series. The developed numerical experiments have shown that two of these interpolants are simple curves and that these (at least) have stable shape, in the sense that their topologies persist when the direction of the velocity at each end-point changes. Our curves are fair, but have different shapes to those of other interpolants. Unlike existing methods, our technique allows regular PH interpolants to be found for special collinearC1Hermite data-sets.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves introduced by Farouki and Sakkalis (1990) are a special class of polynomial/rational curves with polynomial/rational speed functions. They have polynomial/rational arc-lengths, with rational curvature functions and offsets, which provide a number of advantages in CAGD and CAD/CAM applications such as interpolation of discrete data and control of motion along curved paths (Farouki, 1992; Farouki et al., 1998; Farouki and Neff, 1995).There has been a great deal of study of PH curves by many researchers, not only of their formal representation (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Choi et al., 2001; Farouki, 1994) but also of practical aspects (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Choi et al., 2001; Farouki, 1994; Farouki and Neff, 1995; Jüttler, 2001; Moon, 1999). In particular, there has been a lot of work on the use of PH curves for interpolating several types of data-sets; planar data-sets (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Farouki and Neff, 1995; Jüttler, 2001; Kim et al., 2007; Walton and Meek, 1997) and spatial data-sets (Farouki et al., 2002; Pelosi et al., 2005; Sestini et al., 2013), computational and geometric methods, with particular emphasis on the flexibility and algebraic computability of PH curves (Habib and Sakai, 2007; Kong et al., 2008, 2012).The Hermite interpolation of aC1data-set with planar PH curves was first studied by Farouki and Neff (1995). Subsequently, diverse interpolation schemes have been proposed, including: Hermite interpolation using rational PH curves (Pottmann, 1995a, 1995b); Hermite interpolation using the speed reparametrization method (Kong et al., 2008); and Hermite interpolation using Möbius transformations of planar PH cubics (Lee et al., 2012). In this paper, we introduce a new method of solvingC1Hermite interpolation problems with a class of PH curves with the complex representationCm,n(t)=∑k=−mnak(t−c)kwhereak,c∈C,which are called cuts of degree(m,n)of Laurent series. This class of PH curves naturally includes PH cubics, PH quintics, Möbius transformations and PH rational curves: for example, a PH cubic and a quintic are respectively cuts of degree(0,3)and(0,5); and a Möbius transformation is a cut of degree(−1,0). In this paper, we address the interpolation of aC1Hermite data-set using cuts of degree(1,3), which can be regarded algebraically as a generalized combination of cubics and Möbius transformations, and we call them skew cuts. Applying these curves to aC1Hermite data-set, we can obtain four generic simple interpolants, of which two are short and two are long. We can empirically show that the two short simple interpolants, at least, have stable shapes, in the sense that their topologies persist when the direction of the velocity at each end-point is reversed. Further, comparing these interpolants with those obtained by existing methods, we see that they provide different but useful shapes. In addition, we show that, we can obtain regular interpolants for special collinearC1Hermite data-sets, unlike existing methods.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we characterize polynomial PH curves, in the complex representation introduced by Farouki (1994), by the roots of their hodographs. Then we explain some properties of PH curves which we require. In Section 3, we introduce a new class of planar curves in the complex representation, which are cuts of degree(1,3)of Laurent series; and we state and prove theorems which determine when these curves are Pythagorean hodographs. In Section 4, we solve someC1Hermite interpolation problems and analyze and discuss the interpolants obtained, comparing them with interpolants produced by other methods. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results and propose some directions for further study.In this paper, we do not express a planar PH curve asϕ(t)=(x(t),y(t)), but in the complex representationϕ(t)=x(t)+iy(t). This has many algebraic advantages in computation and allows us to characterize a curve in terms of the roots of its hodograph (Kim et al., 2007) as follows:Definition 1Letϕ(t)=x(t)+iy(t)be a planar curve, wherex(t)andy(t)are real rational functions. Thenϕ(t)is called a Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve if and only if there exists a real rational functionσ(t)such thatσ(t)2=‖ϕ′(t)‖2, where‖⋅‖signifies the complex norm.Example 2Letϕ(t)be a planar curve of the form:(1)ϕ(t)=∫K(t−c)2dt,where K is a non-zero complex number and c is a non-real complex number. Then, sinceϕ′(t)=K(t−c)2,ϕ(t)is obviously a PH curve.LetC∞=C∪{∞}, and letΦ:C∞→C∞be the Möbius transformation given by(2)Φ(z)=az+bcz+d.We can easily see that, for an arbitrary PH curveα(t)=x(t)+iy(t),Φ(α(t))is also a PH curve, showing that the PH property of a planar curve is preserved under Möbius transformation.Theorem 3(SeeKim et al., 2007.) A polynomial curve of degree n is a Pythagorean hodograph curve if and only if its hodograph has only real roots and pairs of complex roots, of which one is equal or conjugate to the other.A polynomial curveϕ(t)=x(t)+iy(t)is said to be regular if‖ϕ′(t)‖≠0for all t, i.e.,ϕ′(t)has no real root. Thus, if the polynomial curveϕ(t)is a regular PH curve, we see from Theorem 3 that its hodographϕ′(t)can only have pairs of non-real complex roots, where one root in each pair is equal or conjugate to the other. If the polynomialsx′(t)andy′(t)are relatively prime, then a regular PH curveϕ(t)is said to be primitive (Farouki, 2008). In this case, the hodographϕ′(t)has only non-real complex roots of even multiplicity, of which no two are mutually conjugate.Example 4The planar curve given by Eq. (1) is a primitive PH curve, but the planar cubic curve given byϕ(t)=(t+13t3)+i(2t+23t3)is regular but not primitive. In addition, a planar quintic curveϕ(t)is a regular PH quintic if and only ifϕ(t)=∫K(t−c1)(t−c2)(t−c3)(t−c4)dt, where K is a non-zero complex number and{cj}j=1,2,3,4are pairs of non-real complex numbers, where one number in each pair is equal or conjugate to the other. Moreover, ifϕ(t)is primitive, it can be written as follows:(3)ϕ(t)=∫K(t−c1)2(t−c2)2dt,wherec1andc2are non-real complex numbers, andc1≠c2¯.Remark 5If a regular polynomial PH curveϕ(t)=x(t)+iy(t)is not primitive, then its hodographϕ′(t)must have at least one pair of non-real complex roots which are mutually complex-conjugate. This means thatϕ′(t)has a real factor polynomial. This characteristic is not required to achieve the Pythagorean property, and can increase computational complexity. Hence, in the following sections, we will only use primitive polynomial PH curves to solve interpolation problems and so our interpolants will be regular. Note that all the vectors in our data-sets are expressed as the corresponding complex numbers, i.e.,a+biinstead of(a,b), because we are using the complex representation of PH curves.Definition 6For a Laurent seriesL(z)=∑k=−∞∞ak(z−c)k,a cut of degree(m,n)is defined as follows:Cm,n(t)=∑k=−mnak(t−c)k,wherem,n∈N∪{0}anda−m,an≠0. We call c the center of the cutCm,n(t).Now we will study a cut of degree(m,n)with the PH property of a Laurent series.Example 7Two kinds of elementary cut can be constructed from a Laurent series∑k=−∞∞ak(z−c)k: a cut of degree(0,n), which is a complex polynomial of degree n; or a cut of degree(m,0), which is a special complex rational function with a pole c of degree m, expressed in ascending order. In general, a cut of degree(m,n)withm,n∈Nis simply a sum of two elementary cuts. Each of there elementary cuts can be completely characterized, whether it is a PH curve or not, by algebraic inspection of its hodograph (Choi et al., 2001). More general cases are not so simple, but some further computation allows us to determine reliably whether a cut is a PH curve or not, as shown in the following theorem.Theorem 8Consider a cut of degree(1,3)expressed asC1,3(t)=∑k=−13ak(t−c)k.Whena2≠0,C1,3(t)is a PH curve if and only if(4)a22−3a1a3=0,a−1=0.Whena2=0,C1,3(t)is a PH curve if and only(5)a12+12a3a−1=0.ProofThe derivative ofC1,3(t)is(6)C1,3′(t)=3a3(t−c)2+2a2(t−c)+a1+−a−1(t−c)2=3a3(t−c)4+2a2(t−c)3+a1(t−c)2−a−1(t−c)2.In order forC1,3(t)to be a PH curve, there must exist complex numbersw1andw2such that(7)3a3(t−c)4+2a2(t−c)3+a1(t−c)2−a−1=3a3{(t−w1)2+w2}2.LetP(t)=(t−w1)2+w2. Then, differentiating Eq. (7) with respect to t three times, we obtain(8)72a3(t−c)+12a2=18a3P′(t)P″(t),and evaluating Eq. (8) att=w1, sinceP′(w1)=0, we obtain(9)w1=c−a26a3.In addition, evaluating the first derivative of the left hand side of Eq. (7) att=c, we obtainP(c)P′(c)=2P(c)(c−w1)=0: whena2=0, from Eq. (9), it is admissible; whena2≠0,P(c)must be 0, that's,(10)w2=−(w1−c)2.First, we consider the case whena2≠0. Evaluating the second derivatives of the left and right hand side of Eq. (7) att=w1, we obtain(11)36a3(w1−c)2+12a2(w1−c)+2a1=12a3w2,and by Eq. (10), it follows that24a3(w1−c)2+6a2(w1−c)+a1=0,which implies, together with Eq. (9),a22−3a1a3=0.Then, evaluating Eq. (7) att=c, by Eq. (10), we finally obtaina−1=0. And reversely ifa22−3a1a3=0,a−1=0, from Eq. (6),C1,3(t)is obviously a PH curve. Therefore, whena2≠0,C1,3(t)is a PH curve if and only ifa22−3a1a3=0,a−1=0.Next, we consider the case whena2=0. Evaluating the second derivatives of the left and right hand side of Eq. (7) att=w1, we obtain36a3(w1−c)2+2a1=12a3w2,and sincew1−c=0by Eq. (9), we getw2=a16a3.Also, evaluating Eq. (7) att=c, sincew1−c=0, from the previous equation, we finally obtaina−1=−a1212a3,that is,a12+12a3a−1=0. This completes the proof.  □Remark 9By Theorem 8, whena2≠0, a PH cut of degree(1,3),C1,3(t)=∑k=−13ak(t−c)k, must be a PH cubic sincea−1=0. However, by Definition 6, ifa−1=0,C1,3(t)cannot be a cut of degree(1,3). So, from now on, when we use PH cuts of degree(1,3)for interpolation, we will exclude this case.Whereas whena2=0, a PH cut of degree(1,3),C1,3(t)given byC1,3(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3is an extension of a Möbius transformation and a PH cubic: ifa1anda3approach 0,C1,3(t)changes to a Möbius transformation; whereas ifa−1anda1approach 0,C1,3(t)changes to a PH cubic.Now, let us consider a planar curveψ(t)given by(12)ψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3wherea−1,a0,a1,a3and c are complex. Ifa3a−1≠0, by Theorem 8,ψ(t)is a PH curve if and only ifa12+12a3a−1=0. Whereas ifa3a−1=0, there are two ways thatψ(t)can acquire the PH property: as a PH cubic (a−1=0anda1=0); or as a Möbius transformation (a3=0anda1=0).Whena3a−1≠0anda12+12a3a−1=0, we will callψ(t)a PH skew cut of degree(1,3), and we will explore its use forC1Hermite interpolation in the following sections. In addition, we say thatψ(t)is regular whenψ(t)and its hodographψ′(t)have no singularity onR. In order to assume thatψ(t)is regular whena−1≠0, it is necessary that c is a non-real complex number. In this case, by Eqs. (6) and (7),ψ′(t)generically has a non-zero speed function. Thus, also in the sense that‖ψ(t)′‖≠0, it is regular. Also note thatψ′(t)cannot be represented in the form ofϕ(t)⋅k, whereϕ(t)is a real function and k is a non-real complex number. This means that the graph ofψ′(t)cannot be a straight line.Now, we will solveC1Hermite interpolation problems using PH skew cuts of degree(1,3).Definition 10LetP0,P1,V0andV1be respectively the initial and terminal points and the velocities (tangent vectors) atP0andP1. A data-setHC1={P0,P1,V0,V1}is called aC1Hermite data-set.As shown in Eq. (12), a PH skew cutψ(t)has five undetermined complex coefficients that satisfya12+12a3a−1=0. Thusψ(t)has four degrees of freedom inC, which match the number of elements in aC1Hermite data-set. The following theorem shows that we can use this curve to obtain four generic interpolants for aC1Hermite data-set.Theorem 11There generically exist four PH skew cuts of degree(1,3)that satisfy aC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0,P1,V0,V1}.ProofLetψ(t)be a PH skew cut of degree(1,3)that satisfies a givenC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0,P1,V0,V1}. Then we obtain the following:(13)ψ(0)=P0,ψ(1)=P1,ψ′(0)=V0,ψ′(1)=V1.Substituting into Eq. (12), we have(14)P1−P0=3a3c4−6a3c3+(4a3+a1)c2−(a3+a1)c−a−1c(c−1),(15)V0=3a3c4+a1c2−a−1c2(ora1=−3a3c4−V0c2−a−1c2),(16)V1=3a3c4−12a3c3+(18a3+a1)c2−2(6a3+a1)c−a−1+3a3+a1(c−1)2.From Eqs. (15) and (16), we obtainV1=−6a3c5−(15a3−V0)c4+2(6a3+V0)c3−(3a3+V0)c2+2a−1c−a−1(c−1)2c2,and hence(17)a3=(V0−V1)c4−2(V0−V1)c3+(V0−V1)c2−2a−1c+a−13(2c−1)(c−1)2c2.We now introduces a coordinate system inCwith its origin atP0and its real axis in the positive direction that passes throughP1. Now we can use the scalingx↦x‖P1−P0‖, for allx∈C, to setP1−P0=1, without loss of generality. From Eqs. (14), (15) and (17), we can obtain(18)a−1=−(3(V0+V1−2)c−2V0−V1+3)(c−1)2c22(2c−1).Recall thatψ(t)is a PH curve, becausea12+12a3a−1=0. Manipulating Eqs. (15), (17) and (18), we can obtain a quartic equation in c which must be satisfied by all the PH skew cuts of degree(1,3)which satisfy the data-setHC1. It has the following form:(19)A4c4+A3c3+A2c2+A1c+A0=0,whereA4=16V02+(16V1−96)V0+16V12−96V1+144,A3=−24V02+(168−32V1)V0−288+216V1−40V12,A2=9V02+(22V1−96)V0+216−168V1+33V12,A1=(−6V1+18)V0−72−10V12+54V1,A0=9+V12−6V1.This completes the proof.  □Example 12LetHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=0.5+0.7i,V1=0.3+0.5i}be aC1Hermite data-set, and letψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3be a PH skew cut satisfyingHC1. Then, from Eq. (19), we have(57.60−91.84i)c4+(−120.64+182.08i)c3+(105.76−124.88i)c2+(−44.00+33.84i)c+(−1.96−2.70i)=0.Solving this, we obtain the following four PH skew cut interpolants:ψ1(t)=0.095+0.028i(t−0.211−0.252i)+(0.655−0.101i)(t−0.211−0.252i)+(−0.306+0.208i)(t−0.211−0.252i)3+(0.420−0.334i),ψ2(t)=0.073+0.027i(t−0.789+0.224i)+(0.645−0.195i)(t−0.789+0.224i)+(−0.288+0.396i)(t−0.789+0.224i)3+(0.596+0.224i),ψ3(t)=0.050+0.020i(t−0.519+0.022i)+(0.894−0.455i)(t−0.519+0.022i)+(−0.396+1.508i)(t−0.519+0.022i)3+(0.521+0.249i),ψ4(t)=0.089−0.096i(t−0.495−0.049i)+(0.603+0.457i)(t−0.495−0.049i)+(0.191−0.312i)(t−0.495−0.049i)3+(0.471+0.147i).Fig. 1shows the four interpolants, which are all S-shaped:ψ1andψ2are short simple curves; andψ3andψ4are long simple curves.Remark 13By Theorem 11, generically for arbitraryC1Hermite data-sets, we can obtain four regular PH skew cut interpolants. However, for specialC1Hermite data-sets with probability 0, Eq. (19) can change to a simpler equation: whenA4=A3=0andA2≠0, it reduces to a quadratic equation; and it might have roots with multiplicity higher than 1.Definition 14For aC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0,P1,V0,V1}, if Eq. (19) has four distinct non-real complex roots withA4≠0, we say thatHC1is regular. Otherwise, we say thatHC1is singular.For example, consider aC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0,P1,V0,V1}withV0=V1, Eq. (19) reduces to(20)(2c−1)2(V0−3)(12(V0−1)c2−12(V0−1)c+(V0−3))=0.In this case, we obtain two regular generic interpolants which are determined by the quadratic equation(21)12(V0−1)c2−12(V0−1)c+(V0−3)=0.That is,HC1is singular.Example 15Consider the non-collinearC1Hermite data-set with equal boundary velocities at each end given byHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=0.3+0.3i,V1=0.3+0.3i}, and assume thatψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3is a PH skew cut interpolant satisfyingHC1. Then, from Remark 13, solving(−0.7+0.3i)c2+(−0.7+0.3i)c+112(−2.7+0.3i)=0, we can obtain two regular PH skew cut interpolants that satisfyHC1as follows:ψ1(t)=0.099+0.018i(t−0.329−0.252i)+(0.675−0.075i)(t−0.329−0.252i)+(−0.350+0.150i)(t−0.329−0.252i)3+(0.458+0.008i),ψ2(t)=0.099+0.184i(t−0.671+0.252i)+(0.675−0.075i)(t−0.671+0.252i)+(−0.350+0.150i)(t−0.671+0.252i)3+(0.542−0.008i).Fig. 2shows thatψ1andψ2(labeled 1 and 2) are short simple S-shaped curves.Note that, whenV0=V1∈R, the discriminant of (21) is negative, i.e., c is a non-real complex number, if and only if0<V0<1. This implies that there exist two regular PH skew cut interpolants for the givenC1Hermite data-set, as shown in Fig. 5 of Example 16. However, for the sameC1Hermite data-set, solving the interpolation problem with PH quintics, the straight line throughP0andP1is the only possible interpolant, which is a non-primitive regular PH quintic: i.e., solving the same interpolation problem with primitive PH quintics, we cannot obtain any solution. This means that, unlike primitive PH quintics, our method can generate regular interpolants for aC1Hermite data-setHC1which is collinear, in the sense thatV0=V1‖P1−P0‖, if0<‖V0‖‖P1−P0‖<1; examples are shown in Fig. 5. In addition, ifV0=V1=3, Eq. (20) always holds, so that for any given c, we can obtain a corresponding PH skew cut interpolant that satisfies the givenC1Hermite data-set. Thus we can construct a one-parameter family of PH skew cut interpolants satisfying the data-set, such as that shown in Fig. 6. As a special case, whenV0=V1=1, Eq. (21) cannot hold, so that no PH skew cut interpolant exists. However, in this case, a PH skew cut interpolant may be obtainable after speed reparametrization (Kong et al., 2008). In the following examples, we solve some interpolation problems for interesting singularC1Hermite data-sets.What happens when boundary velocities are parallel but unequal? This situation is similar to that of Example 15, and there may be four regular PH skew cut interpolants, as shown in Fig. 3: two short simple curves and two long simple curves. By comparing Figs. 2 and 3 and Eqs. (19) and (20), we can guess that, as the speeds of parallel boundary velocities converge, while the two long interpolants change to two singular straight-line interpolants, the two short simple interpolants might persist stably. Fig. 4provides empirical support for this conjecture: as the speeds of the parallel boundary velocities converge, the two long simple interpolants expand (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 4), finally appearing to become four straight-lines (Fig. 4(b)), corresponding to the rootc=12of Eq. (20); meanwhile, the two short simple interpolants retain their topologies.Example 16In this example, we consider the PH skew cut interpolants that satisfy some types of collinearC1Hermite data-sets.First, we consider a collinearC1Hermite data-set with the same boundary velocity at each end:HC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=0.3,V1=0.3}. Assume thatψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3is a PH skew cut satisfyingHC1. Then, following Remark 13, since0<‖V0‖‖P1−P0‖<1, we can solve Eq. (21) and obtain the following two regular PH skew cut interpolants which satisfyHC1:ψ1(t)=0.108(t−0.500+0.267i)+(0.675)(t−0.500+0.267i)+(0.350)(t−0.500+0.267i)3+(0.500−0.267i),ψ2(t)=0.108(t−0.500−0.267i)+(0.675)(t−0.500−0.267i)+(−0.350)(t−0.500−0.267i)3+(0.500+0.267i),which are shown in Fig. 5(annotated 1 and 2).Next, we consider the singular collinearC1Hermite data-setHC1with the same boundary velocity, at each end, so thatHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=3,V1=3}. Assume thatψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3is a PH skew cut satisfyingHC1. In this situation, following Remark 13, we can obtain any numbers of regular interpolants satisfyingHC1by varying c. Fig. 6shows a selection forc=0.7+0.25i,0.7+0.2i,0.7+320i,0.7+0.1i,0.7+0.05i.Finally, we look at a different kind of collinearC1Hermite data-set in which‖V0‖≠‖V1‖; consider the exampleHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=1,V1=1.5}. Assume thatψ(t)=a−1t−c+a0+a1(t−c)+a3(t−c)3is a PH skew cut satisfyingHC1. Now, sinceV0≠V1, we have to solve Eq. (19) to satisfyHC1, which is an algebraic equation of degree 4 with real coefficients in this case. Thus we can only obtain regular skew cut PH interpolants from Eq. (19) if it has non-real complex roots, and the numbers of interpolants depend on the number of such roots. Fig. 7(a) shows the regular PH skew cut interpolants that satisfyHC1, which are two simple spirals. However, a somewhat modified data-setHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=0.5,V1=1}of the same type has four regular PH skew cut interpolants, as shown in Fig. 7(b). If we look at a third collinearC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=5,V1=2}, we obtain only real roots of Eq. (19) (c=0.3742338856, 0.4964315291, −0.6011468216, and −0.9327080961), and so we cannot construct any regular PH skew cut interpolants. However, as mentioned in Remark 13, also in this case, a PH skew cut interpolant may be obtainable after speed reparametrization.Now, we compare the interpolants with the best shapes that we obtained using our method for aC1Hermite data-set, with interpolants produced by other methods.Example 17Consider theC1Hermite data-setHC1={P0=0,P1=1,V0=−0.35+0.21i,V1=0.3+0.5i}. We will find interpolants for this data-set using PH skew cuts, PH quintics and Möbius transformations of PH cubics. First, we select two simple PH skew cut interpolants with lower bending energy, labeledc1andc2in Fig. 8. Next, we compare them with all the other interpolants.Bending energy can be expressed as∫ακ2ds, where κ is the curvature of a curve. Fairness can be related to the integral ofκ2(Farouki, 1996). For the data-setHC1, PH skew cuts provide alternative interpolants to PH quintic interpolants with shapes that are as good or better. In Fig. 8(a) and (c), we observe that PH quintic interpolants have quite shorter arc-length than PH skew cuts. However we also observe that the direction of the velocity vector of each PH quintic interpolant changes rapidly near the boundary points. This implies large curvatures near the boundary points as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (c), which give high bending energies. Table 1confirms that the PH skew interpolants ofHC1have lower bending energies than the PH quintic interpolants.In Fig. 8(b) and (d), we observe that PH skew cut interpolants resemble the short simple interpolants produced by the Möbius transformation of PH cubics. Their shapes appear to have the same stability as the PH skew cut interpolants, which we attribute to the first terma−1t−cof a PH skew cut. We surmise that this term creates stability because it produces an inversion inC. Table 1 shows that the PH skew cut interpolants have lower bending energies than all the interpolants obtained by the Möbius transformations of PH cubics, exceptm4, which is very long, making it unsuitable for many application. Fig. 9(b) and (d) shows that the higher bending energies of Möbius cubicsm1,m2andm3are also mainly caused by their large curvatures near the boundary points. Thus we contend that PH skew cut interpolants produce well-shaped alternatives to Möbius transformations of PH cubics.We have introduced a new method of solvingC1Hermite interpolation problems with a class of PH curves in the complex representation, which are called skew cuts of degree(1,3)of Laurant series. We proved that they can provide four generic interpolants to aC1Hermite data-set: two short simple curves and two long simple curves. We showed that this method allows us to obtain PH skew cuts interpolants for collinearC1Hermite data-sets, unlike other methods based on primitive PH curves. We also demonstrated empirically that the two short simple interpolants, at least, have stable shapes.We propose two goals for further study. One is to be able to predict what regions in the phase-space of parameters will allow two short simple PH skew cut interpolants to be obtained for aC1Hermite data-set, including the complete analysis of the algebraic and topological characteristics of the interpolants. The other is to provide a usable criterion to compare the fairness of the interpolants obtained by different PH methods.
