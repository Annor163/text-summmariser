@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of singular value decomposition, expectation maximization, and Elman Neural Networks in optimization of code converter outputs in the classification of epilepsy risk levels from EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. The signal parameters such as the total number of positive and negative peaks, spikes and sharp waves, their duration etc., were extracted using morphological operators and wavelet transforms. Code converters were considered as a level one classifier. Code converters were found to have a performance index and quality value of 33.26 and 12.74, respectively, which is low. Consequently, for the EEG signals of 20 patients, the post classifiers were applied across 3 epochs of 16 channels. After having made a comparative study of different architectures, SVD was found to be the best post classifier as it marked a performance index of 89.48 and a quality value of 20.62. Elman neural network also exhibits good performance metrics than SVD in the morphological operator based feature extraction method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
EEG is widely used clinical procedure for the study and diagnosis of several neurological disorders—epilepsy being one [1]. Epilepsy can be defined as a common and diverse set of brain disorders characterized by seizures. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal, excessive, and/or hyper synchronous neural activity which is characterized by a rhythmic or repetitive neural activity in the central nervous [2].In the past, interpretation of the EEG signals were limited to visual inspection by neurophysiologist, an individual trained to qualitatively make a distinction between normal EEG activity and abnormalities contained within EEG records. EEG is characterized by repetitive high-amplitude activity, either by slow waves, or spike and wave complexes [3]. This activity varies depending upon the type of epilepsy. EEG is a determinative factor as far as patients’ clinical records is concerned [4]. A common form of recording used for this purpose is an ambulatory recording that contains EEG data for a very long duration of even up to one week. It involves an expert's efforts in analyzing the entire length of the EEG recordings to detect traces of epilepsy [4].Brain control interface (BCI) can also be considered in this context since it is a tool for direct communication between human and external devices [2]. Many BCI's make use of EEG signals to categorize two or more classes and associate them to simple computer commands. But, classification of EEG signals is a difficult task because this can only measure blurred cortical activities due to the diffusion of the skull and the skin [3]. Recordings are also highly contaminated by the noise of various sources. Therefore, while considering the EEG signals, it is important to consider both spatial and temporal dynamics of EEG data.
