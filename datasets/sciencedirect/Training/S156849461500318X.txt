@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we present a clustering framework for type-2 fuzzy clustering which covers all steps of the clustering process including: clustering algorithm, parameters estimation, and validation and verification indices. The proposed clustering algorithm is developed based on dual-centers type-2 fuzzy clustering model. In this model the centers of clusters are defined by a pair of objects rather than a single object. The membership values of the objects to the clusters are defined by type-2 fuzzy numbers and there are not any type reduction or defuzzification steps in the proposed clustering algorithm. In addition, the relation among the size of the cluster bandwidth, distance between dual-centers and fuzzifier parameter are indicated and analyzed to facilitate the parameters estimation step. To determine the optimum number of clusters, we develop a new validation index which is compatible with the proposed model structure. A new compatible verification index is also defined to compare the results of the proposed model with existing type-1 fuzzy clustering model. Finally, the results of computational experiments are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Uncertainty is a state of having limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcomes. Fuzziness (or vagueness), non-specificity (or imprecision) and strife (or discord) are different types of uncertainty and they are unavoidable when dealing with real-world problems [1]. Cluster analysis is one type of pattern recognition methods which defines a similarity measure and uses this to assign objects from a set into groups. All members of a certain group will be sufficiently similar to each other under this measure.After introducing fuzzy set theory by Zadeh [2], the usage of fuzzy membership propound in clustering algorithms and degrees of belonging to the clusters is defined as a value over the closed interval [0,1] in type-1 fuzzy clustering model [3]. Type-1 fuzzy sets cannot model many uncertainties in the real systems such as uncertainty in meanings of rules, uncertainty in consequent value, noisy measurements, or noise in data for tuning the parameters of type-1 fuzzy logic system [4]. Type-2 fuzzy sets [5] are the extension of type-1 fuzzy sets which are able to model such uncertainties by their fuzzy membership values rather than crisp ones, but at the expense of higher computational complexity.Existing type-2 fuzzy clustering models available in the literature are mainly focused on parameter uncertainty [6] which requires examining several possible combinations of parameters in order to select the proper one. Moreover, in this approach, the structure of clustering model is not well adopted for type-2 fuzzy clustering and consequently, type-reduction and defuzzification operations are repeated per algorithm iteration which undermines the uncertainty modeling. To achieve a successful clustering without these difficulties, a novel type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm is introduced in this paper.The proposed approach is developed based on the uncertainty in the center of the clusters and defines the degree of belonging to the clusters as interval type-2 fuzzy numbers. The experimental results have indicated the effectiveness of the proposed approach as applied to the type-2 fuzzy clustering model with dual-centers clusters. This paper is organized as follows: in the next section the fuzzy clustering background is addressed. The third section describes the proposed model. The experimental results are presented in section four. Finally, the last section concludes the paper.
