Automation in heritage – Parametric and associative design strategies to model inaccessible monuments: The case-study of eighteenth-century Lisbon Águas Livres Aqueduct

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We modelled an 18th-century monument, about 14km long in a short time.We used parametric associative geometry design tools for generating a digital model.We were able to automatically update the model, partially or totally.We avoided the need of its complete reformulation.We have a product that allows its use in contexts of virtual tours.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The purpose of this work was to devise a methodology that would enable modelling, using common tools and available data. The reason for not using sophisticated digital survey technology is mainly related to the fact that we want to implement a procedure affordable to any research work.The study subject does to some extent reflect this lack of access to data because it is mostly buried. It would have to be excavated to conduct either a traditional or laser-scanner survey. This would be very hard to do in full, since the aqueduct is about 14km long. However, the fact that we are using an existing building will ultimately make it possible to compare the model with the reality, and thus validate the series of procedures proposed, provided that prospecting and sounding work are carried out on the monument.Since this model represents reality, i.e. with varying levels of detail depending on the data used, the following criteria were established for its implementation:1-It should allow the upgrading of the information used in the model (geometric and relational) without having to redo the entire modelling process. This required the development of a parametric model.It should be able to link technical information and historical references (alphanumeric) relating to the monument. This meant creating a BIM model.It should be possible to use the model as the principal means of communication between the services responsible for its maintenance (technical and museological). This required establishing a relational database, to link the reports and photographs of the site visit.It should be possible to use the model as a means of publicizing the monument through virtual tours. This meant developing a visualization model.Basically, it is a way of making the sequence of modelling work more interactively by introducing cyclical processing, focused particularly on the data communication stages so as to extract new data that can be used in subsequent modelling stages (Fig. 1), since data acquisition is a consequence of an activity open to any user.In general terms, the main aims were−to establish the procedures which assist in the use of graphic elements in historical/archaeological context;to build virtual models for heritage management purposes;to write an account of the historical facts so as to evaluate the topographic potential for piping water from Belas to Lisbon.The specific goals were−to identify the major limitations of current survey tools, especially when implemented on extensive monuments;to develop a database (standardized, as much as possible) related to the monument;to build a digital model that enables future updates, in particular georeferencing data components;to produce simplified sub-models that allow virtual tours;to propose a survey method and representation for this type of monument;to evaluate the automation of repetitive procedures (at least, in an initial phase) using programming language (such as Scheme), to minimize the introduction of human errors.
