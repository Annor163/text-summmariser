@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with the nonsymmetric control gain matrix and the unknown dead-zone inputs. In this scheme, fuzzy systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions and the estimated symmetric gain matrix is decomposed into a product of one diagonal matrix and two orthogonal matrices. Based on the decomposition results, a controller is developed, therefore, the possible controller singularity problem and the parameter initialization condition constraints problem are avoided. In addition, a dynamic robust controller is employed to compensate for the lumped errors. It is proved that all the signals in the proposed closed-loop system are bounded and that the tracking errors converge asymptotically to zero. A simulation example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thanks to the universal approximation property [1,2], many adaptive fuzzy control schemes have been developed for uncertain single-input single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems [1–14]. Due to the complexity of MIMO systems, most of the schemes proposed for SISO systems cannot be extended directly to MIMO systems. In recent years, several adaptive fuzzy control schemes have been developed for MIMO nonlinear systems [15–28]. The basic idea of some proposed works [17,19,21,27] is that the controllers are generally based on a suitable combination of an adaptive fuzzy controller and a robust compensator. The adaptive fuzzy controller is used to deal with system uncertainties, while the robust compensator is mainly utilized to cope with those ubiquitous modeling approximation errors. In [15,18,22], based on the sliding-mode surface technique and backstepping technique, the stable adaptive fuzzy output feedback scheme is developed for MIMO systems. In general, to obtain an indirect adaptive fuzzy controller for MIMO systems, some of the aforementioned results are needed to calculate the inverse of the estimated gain matrix [16,17,19,21,24,27]. Furthermore, to realize the robust controller, a restriction is required that the control direction must be known a priori. Without the priori knowledge of the control direction, the adaptive fuzzy control of these systems becomes much more challenging. That is why most previous schemes assume that the control direction is known a priori. For instance, in [21,24,28], it is assumed that the control gain matrix is positive definite.Another important issue of the adaptive fuzzy control of MIMO nonlinear systems is the possible controller singularity problem. To overcome this problem, in [18,16], the authors simply assumed that the estimated gain matrix is always nonsingular. In [17,19,20], a direct adaptive control scheme or a projection algorithm is used to deal with this problem. In [21,24], the regularized inverse of the estimated gain matrix instead of its inverse is utilized to avoid this problem. In [23], a modified CE control law is applied to avoid the possible singularity problem. However, the schemes in [21,23,24] required parameter initialization condition constraints as pointed out in [21]. To avoid this problem, the second adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed in [21], however, the another restrictive assumption on the best approximation of the gain matrix is necessary.In practice, nonsmooth nonlinearities, such as dead-zone, backlash, hysteresis, and saturation, exist in various engineering systems. The dead-zone which can severely affect system performance is one of the most important nonsmooth nonlinearities encountered in actuators, such as hydraulic and pneumatic valves, electric servomotors, and electronic circuits. It is thereby more advisable to take into account the effects of the dead-zone in the controller design. In most practical systems, the dead-zone parameters are poorly known. To handle these systems, several adaptive control approaches have been developed in recent years [29–38]. In [29], model reference adaptive controllers are designed for linear systems with unknown dead-zones, and adaptive output feedback dead-zone compensation scheme is designed for nonlinear systems with an unknown dead-zone in [30]. The above schemes employed an adaptive dead-zone inverse to counteract the effect of dead-zone, and this technique is also used to eliminate asymptotically the effect of the unknown dead-zone on the closed-loop system in [31,32]. However, the aforementioned schemes can be achieved under the condition that the output of the dead-zone is measurable. Given a matching condition to the reference model, an adaptive controller with an adaptive dead-zone inverse is introduced in [33]. With satisfying a matching condition to the state matrix and the input matrix, a decentralized variable structure controller is proposed for a class of uncertain large-scale systems with dead-zone input [34]. Without satisfying the matching condition, some adaptive state feedback and output feedback controllers using the backstepping technique and the smooth inverse function of dead zone are developed for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems in [35]. Furthermore, an adaptive fuzzy decentralized fault-tolerant control method is developed for a class of uncertain nonlinear large-scale systems with the actuator failures [39]. However, in all of the aforementioned control schemes [33–35], a dead-zone inverse has to be constructed to counteract the effects of dead-zone. By using the new description of a dead-zone and exploring the properties of the dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a robust adaptive control scheme and an adaptive compensation algorithm are employed without constructing the dead-zone inverse in [36,37]. When the uncertainty matrix and disturbance satisfy the matching conditions, robust and adaptive variable structure output feedback control of uncertain systems with dead-zone nonlinearity is proposed in [38]. However, the aforementioned adaptive control schemes are only suitable for the following three types of systems: linear systems, the nonlinear dynamics whose models are known accurately and the unknown nonlinear functions which can be linearly parameterized. In the case that the nonlinear functions are not linearly parameterized and the nonlinear systems with unknown dead-zone, fuzzy adaptive control scheme is investigated for the uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems with the unknown actuator nonlinearities and the unknown control direction in [26,40], and adaptive neural network backstepping controllers are proposed for SISO and MIMO nonlinear strict-feedback systems with unknown dead-zone in [41–43]. In addition, adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme is developed for a class of SISO nonlinear systems with unknown dead-zone in [44], where the inverse method of the dead-zone is constructed. However, this control scheme cannot be applied to MIMO systems. In [45], based on the backstepping technique, a new adaptive fuzzy output feedback control approach is developed for a class of MIMO strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown dead-zone inputs. In [28], a fuzzy adaptive variable-structure controller is investigated for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems with both sector nonlinearities and dead-zones. However, these underlying results suffered from some fundamental limitations. For instance, in [45], the controllers should be bounded, and in [28], the unknown control gains matrix is symmetric and positive-definite.Based on the previous results, an adaptive fuzzy control scheme is developed for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems with nonsymmetric control gain matrix and unknown dead-zone inputs. In the control design, the nonsymmetric control gain matrix is expressed as a sum of a symmetric matrix and a skew symmetric matrix, fuzzy systems are employed to approximate the plant's unknown dynamics, and the estimated symmetric gain matrix is decomposed into a product of one diagonal matrix and two orthogonal matrixes. Adaptive fuzzy controllers are constructed by using the matrix decomposition technique, and a dynamic robust controller is proposed to compensate for the lumped errors. The main originalities of the proposed control scheme are as follows: (1) it can solve for the problem of a nonsymmetric control gain matrix; (2) it does not require a priori knowledge of the control direction due to the fact that the dynamic robust controller is designed; and (3) the proposed controller does not depend upon any parameter initialization constrain. The proposed design scheme guarantees the boundary of signals in the resulting closed-loop systems and the convergence of the tracking errors to zero.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the plant dynamics and control objective are described. In Section 3, a brief description of fuzzy systems is reviewed. In Section 4 the suggested adaptive fuzzy control scheme is presented while simulation result is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.Note that ∥.∥ indicates the Euclidean norm throughout the paper.Consider a class of MIMO nonlinear dynamic system in the following form(1)y1(r1)=f1(x)+∑j=1pg1j(x)Γj(uj)⋮yp(rp)=fp(x)+∑j=1pgpj(x)Γj(uj)wherex=[y1,y˙1,…,y1(r1−1),…,yp,y˙p,…,yp(rp−1)]T∈RL⊂Uis the system state vector which is assumed to be available for measurement;L=∑i=1pri, u=[u1, …, up]T∈Rpand y=[y1, …, yp]T∈Rpare the system input vector and output vector, respectively; Γj(uj) is the jth actuator nonlinearity which is assumed to be an unknown dead-zone; and fi(x), i=1, 2, …, p and gij(x), i, j=1, 2, …, p are the continuous unknown smooth nonlinear functions.Denotingy(r)=[y1(r1),…yp(rp)]TF(x)=[f1(x),…,fp(x)]TΓ=[Γ1(u1),⋯,Γp(up)]TG(x)=g11(x)⋯g1p(x)⋮⋱⋮gp1(x)⋯gpp(x)then, Eq. (1) can be written in the following compact form(2)y(r)=F(x)+G(x)Γwhere F(x)∈Rpand G(x)∈Rp×p.The ith unknown dead-zone with input ui(t) and output Γi(ui(t)) is described by[36](3)Γi(ui(t))=mri(ui(t)−bri),forui(t)≥bri0,forbli<ui(t)<brimli(ui(t)−bli),forui(t)≤bliwhere mriand mlistand for the right and the left slopes of the dead-zone characteristic. It is assumed that mri=mli=mi, briand blirepresent the breakpoints of the input nonlinearity.To facilitate the control system design, the following assumption is given.Assumption 1The dead-zone parameters bri, bli, and miare unknown bounded constants, but their signs are known: bri>0, bli<0, mi>0. The dead-zone output Γi(ui(t)) is not available for measurement.As a result, the output of the ith dead-zone can be reformulated as(4)Γi(ui(t))=miui(t)+di(ui(t))where di(ui(t)) can be calculated from (3) and (4) as(5)di(ui(t))=−mibri,forui(t)≥bri−miui(t),forbli<ui(t)<bri−mibli,forui(t)≤bli.From Assumption 1, an unknown positive constantdi*exists that|di(ui(t))|≤di*.Now, denoteB=diag[m1,…,mp]d(u)=[d1(u1(t)),…,dp(up(t))]T.From Eq. (4), the output of the dead-zone can be written as follows(6)Γ=Bu+d(u)where B is a diagonal positive-definite matrix, and d(u) can be treated as bounded disturbances.Substituting (6) into (2), one obtains(7)y(r)=F(x)+G(x)Bu+G(x)d(u).The controllability-like of (7) requires that G(x) is nonsingular for all x, thus the following assumption is made.Assumption 2The matrix G(x) is nonsingular.Remark 1Most of the previous efforts related to the adaptive fuzzy control of MIMO nonlinear systems are reported in [21–26]. However, these results assumed that the control direction is known a priori. For example, it is assumed that the control gain matrix is positive definite symmetric [21,24]. In [25,26], although the control gain matrix is assumed unknown, the case where the indefinite gain matrix is not considered. In this study, there are no restrictions on the sign and the symmetry of the control gain matrix.The objective of this study is to design an adaptive fuzzy controller u(t) such that the system output y follows the reference signal Ym=[ym1, ym2, …, ymp]T, while all the signals in the derived closed-loop system are able to remain bounded.Assumption 3The reference signal ymi(t)(i=1, ⋯, p) together with its derivatives up to order riare smooth and bounded.Define the tracking errors as(8)e1(t)=ym1(t)−y1(t)⋮ep(t)=ymp(t)−yp(t)and the filtered tracking errors as(9)s1=ddt+λ1r1−1e1(t),λ1>0⋮sp=ddt+λprp−1ep(t),λp>0.Eq. (9) can be written as following form(10)si=ei(ri−1)+βi,ri−1ei(ri−2)+…+βi,1ei(i=1,2,…,p)whereβi,j=(ri−1)!(ri−j)!(j−1)!λiri−j,i=1,…,p,j=1,⋯,ri−1.Since the constant λi>0, then, the roots of the equationHi(s)=sri−1+βi,ri−1sri−2+⋯+βi,1=0(i=1,2,…,p)are all strictly in the open left-half complex plane, which means ei(t)→0 asymptotically as si(t)→0 from Eq. (10). Thus, the problem of tracking the ri−dimensional vector[ymi,y˙mi.…,ymi(ri−1)]Tcan be replaced by a 1st-order stabilization problem in the scalar si. Therefore, the objective of this study becomes the design of a control law to make si(t)→0(i=1, 2, …, p).Differentiating siwith respect to time yields(11)s˙1=v1−f1(x)−∑j=1pg1j(x)Γj(uj)⋮s˙p=vp−fp(x)−∑j=1pgpj(x)Γj(uj)where(12)v1=ym1(r1)+β1,r1−1e1(r1−1)+⋯+β1,1e˙1⋮vp=ymp(rp)+βp,rp−1ep(rp−1)+⋯+βp,1e˙p.Denotes=[s1,…,sp]Tv=[v1,…,vp]T.Eq. (11) can be written in the following form(13)s˙=v−F(x)−G(x)Bu−G(x)d(u).If the nonlinear functions fi(x) and gij(x), the constants mianddj*, are all known. Denote(14)usign=sign(s1)∑j=1p|g1j(x)|dj*⋮sign(sp)∑j=1p|gpj(x)|dj*.The following control law(15)u=(G(x)B)−1(−F(x)+v+K0s+usign)where K0=diag[k01, …, k0p] with k0i>0, can be used to meet the control objective. Indeed, substituting (15) into (13), one gets(16)s˙=−K0s−usign−G(x)d(u).Consider the following Lyapunov function(17)V0=12sTs.Using (16) and (17) yields(18)V˙0=−sTK0s−sT(usign+G(x)d(u)).Since(19)sT(usign+G(x)d(u))=∑i=1p∑j=1p(|si||gij(x)|dj*+sigij(x)dj)≥0then one obtains(20)V˙0≤−sTK0s≤0.From(20), we conclude that si→0 as t→∞.In (15), however, the term usignis discontinuous, which may cause chattering phenomena, and the inverse of matrix G(x)B should be calculated. To eliminate this chattering phenomena and to avoid the calculation of the inverse, we need the following useful lemmas.Lemma 1[46]. Any real matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric matrix and a skew symmetric matrix.Lemma 2[46]. Let A be an n×n matrix and ρ(A) be spectral radius of A, then ρ(A)≤∥A∥.Using Lemma 1, the matrix G(x)B can be decomposed as follows(21)G(x)B=G1(x)+G2(x)where G1(x)=(G(x)B+BTGT(x))/2 is a symmetric matrix and G2(x)=(G(x)B−BTGT(x))/2 is a skew symmetric matrix.From (21), G1(x) is a symmetric matrix, and it can be denoted asG1(x)=g111(x)g112(x)⋯g11p(x)g112(x)g122(x)⋯g12p(x)⋮⋮⋱⋮g11p(x)g12p(x)⋯g1pp(x).Denotes¯=[|s1|,…,|sp|]T(22)u¯d=∑j=1p|g1j(x)|dj*⋮∑j=1p|gpj(x)|dj*.Motivated by [23], let us now consider the following control law(23)u=(sTG1(x)s)−1s(−sTF(x)+sTv+sTK0s+s¯Tu¯d).It can also be used to meet the control objective. Indeed, substituting (23) into (13), and given the fact that sTG2(x)s=0 (G2(x) is a skew symmetric matrix) ands¯Tu¯d=sTusign, one gets(24)sTs˙=−sTK0s−sT(usign+G(x)d(u)).Recall that the inequality (19) also holds, then one obtains(25)V˙0≤−sTK0s≤0.Remark 2Compared the control law (23) with (15), the controller law (23) is not necessary to calculate the inverse of matrix and has no discontinuous term. Moreover, the control law (23) is designed by using symmetric matrix G1(x), while the control law (15) is designed by using nonsymmetric matrix. It is worth noting that the symmetric characteristic of matrix G1(x) in (23) is very useful. In fact, the symmetry of matrix G1(x) will be exploited in designing the controller to avoid the initialization problem and singularity problem, in addition, it will be exploited in reducing the number of parameters updated on-line in adaptive fuzzy controller design.The control law (23) is implemented easily in the cases where the nonlinear functions fi(x) and gij(x), the constants mianddi*, are all known. However, this control law (23) cannot be implemented in the present study since these nonlinear functions and constants are unknown. Thus we use fuzzy systems to approximate these nonlinear functions.In this section, the fuzzy system applied in this paper is discussed briefly. The basic configuration of fuzzy system consists of fuzzifier, some fuzzy IF-THEN rules, fuzzy inference engine and defuzzifier. The fuzzy inference engine employs fuzzy IF-THEN rules to perform a mapping from an input vector x=[x1, …, xn]T∈Rnto an output variable y∈R. The lth fuzzy rule is written in the following form:Rl:IFx1isF1land⋯andxnisFnl,THENyisGlwhereFiland Glare fuzzy sets, associating with fuzzy membership functionsμFil(xi)andμGl(y), respectively, l=1, …, m, m is the number of rules.Using the strategy of singleton fuzzification, product inference and center-average defuzzification, the output of the fuzzy system is given as follows(26)y(x)=∑l=1myl(∏i=1nμFil(xi))∑l=1m∏i=1nμFil(xi)whereyl=maxy∈RμGl(y). By introducing the concept of the fuzzy basis function vector ξ(x), Eq. (26) can be rewritten as(27)y(x)=θˆTξ(x):=fˆ(x|θˆ)whereθˆ=[y1,…,ym]T,ξ(x)=[ξ1(x),…,ξm(x)]Twithξl(x)=∏i=1nμFil(xi)∑l=1m∏i=1nμFil(xi).Lemma 3[1,2]. Let f(x) be a continuous function defined on a compact set Ω. Then, for any constant ɛ>0, there exists a fuzzy system(27)such thatsupx∈Ω|f(x)−fˆ(x|θˆ)|≤ɛ.According to Lemma 3, the fuzzy system (27) is able to approximate any continuous nonlinear function on a compact set to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. In this study, it is assumed that the structure of the fuzzy system and the fuzzy basis function parameters are properly specified in advance by the designer, and the consequent parameters must be calculated by adaptive laws.Since fi(x), gij(x), mi, anddi*are unknown, g1ij(x) is also unknown, using Lemma 3, we assume that fi(x), g1ij(x), and∑j=1p|gij(x)|dj*can be approximated by the following fuzzy systemsFor i=1, …, p(28)fˆi(x|θˆfi)=θˆfiTξfi(x)(29)gˆ1ii(x|θˆg1ii)=θˆg1iiTξg1ii(x)(30)gˆdi(x|θˆgdi)=θˆgdiTξgdi(x)For i=1, …, p−1, j=i+1, …, p(31)gˆ1ij(x|θˆg1ij)=θˆg1ijTξg1ij(x)where ξfi(x), ξg1ii(x), ξgdi(x), and ξg1ij(x) are fuzzy basis function vectors, andθˆfi,θˆg1ii,θˆgdi, andθˆg1ijare the parameter vectors of each fuzzy system designed later.DenoteFˆ(x|θˆf)=[fˆ1(x|θˆf1),⋯,fˆp(x|θˆfp)]TGˆ1(x|θˆg1)=gˆ111(x|θˆg111)gˆ112(x|θˆg112)⋯gˆ11p(x|θˆg11p)gˆ112(x|θˆg112)gˆ122(x|θˆg122)⋯gˆ12p(x|θˆg12p)⋮⋮⋱⋮gˆ11p(x|θˆg11p)gˆ12p(x|θˆg12p)⋯gˆ1pp(x|θˆg1pp)u¯ˆd=gˆd1(x|θˆgd1)⋮gˆdp(x|θˆgdp).Now, let us consider a control law as follows(32)u=(sTGˆ1(x|θˆg)s)−1s(−sTFˆ(x|θˆf)+sTv+sTK0s+s¯Tu¯ˆd).This control law results from (23) by using the fuzzy approximationsFˆ(x|θˆf),Gˆ1(x|θˆg), andu¯ˆdinstead of the functions F(x), G1(x), andu¯d, respectively.Since the matrixGˆ1(x|θˆg)is generated online by the estimation of the parametersθˆg, the control law (32) is not well-defined whensTGˆ1(x|θˆg)s=0. Note thatGˆ1(x|θˆg)is symmetric, thus it can be decomposed as follows [46](33)Gˆ1(x|θˆg1)=PDλ¯P−1where P is an orthogonal matrix,Dλ¯=diag[λ¯1,…,λ¯p], hereλ¯iis the eigenvalue of matrixGˆ1(x|θˆg1).To avoid the singular problem of the controller (32), we modify the control law (32) as follows(34)u0=−sTFˆ(x|θˆf)+sTv+sTK0s+s¯Tu¯ˆd+ursTGˆ1(x|θˆg)s+μsTs+ur2(35)u=su0whereμ=ɛ+∥Gˆ1(x|θˆg1)∥, and where ɛ is a small given positive constant, uris a dynamic robust controller, which is used to compensate for the lumped errors.From Lemma 2, for i=1, …, p,|λ¯i|≤ρ(Gˆ1(x|θˆg1))≤∥Gˆ1(x|θˆg1)∥, the matrixGˆ1(x|θˆg1)+μIp=P(Dλ¯+μIp)P−1is positive definite, therefore we can concludesTGˆ1(x|θˆg)s+μsTs=sT(Gˆ1(x|θˆg)+μIp)s≥0. As long as the dynamic robust controller uris away from zero, the controller (34) is always well-defined. The dynamic equations of urwill be designed later.Remark 3Eq. (33) is introduced mainly for analysis purposes because the values of P andλ¯iare not required when implementing the controller (34).Remark 4In [21,24,23], the regularized inverse of the estimated gain matrix is used to avoid the possible singularity problem, however, it required the initialization condition constraint[21], namely, the initial parameters cannot be selected as zero. In this study, we can selectθˆg1ij(0)=0, thus the controller (34) does not depend upon any initialization condition constraint. Moreover, the calculation of the inverse of the matrixGˆ1(x|θˆg)in the control law (34) can be avoided.Substituting (35) into yields(36)s˙=v−F(x)−G(x)Bsu0−G(x)d(u).Multiplying sTto (36) and using Eq. (34) obtains(37)sTs˙=−sTK0s+sT(Fˆ(x|θˆf)−F(x))+sT(Gˆ1(x|θˆg1)−G1(x))su0+μsTsu0−ur+u0ur2−sTG(x)d(u)−s¯Tu¯ˆd.Define the optimal approximation parametersθˆfi*,θˆg1ii*,θˆgdi*, andθˆg1ij*as follows:θˆfi*=argminθˆfi∈Ωfi[supx∈U|fˆi(x|θˆfi)−fi(x)|]θˆg1ii*=argminθˆg1ii∈Ωg1ii[supx∈U|gˆ1ii(x|θˆg1ii)−g1ii(x)|]θˆgdi*=argminθˆgdi∈Ωgdi[supx∈U|∑j=1p|gij(x)|dj*−gˆdi(x|θˆgdi)|]θˆg1ij*=argminθˆg1ij∈Ωg1ij[supx∈U|gˆ1ij(x|θˆg1ij)−g1ij(x)|]where Ωfi, Ωg1ii, Ωgdi, and Ωg1ijare the compact set of allowable controller parameters. Define the parameter errors asϕfi=θˆfi−θˆfi*,ϕg1ii=θˆg1ii−θˆg1ii*,ϕgdi=θˆgdi*−θˆgdi,ϕg1ij=θˆg1ij−θˆg1ij*, andωfi(x)=fˆi(x|θˆfi*)−fi(x)ωg1ii(x)=gˆ1ii(x|θˆg1ii*)−g1ii(x)ωgdi(x)=∑j=1p|gij(x)|dj*−gˆdi(x|θˆgdi*)ωg1ij(x)=gˆ1ij(x|θˆg1ij*)−g1ij(x)as the minimum approximation errors.In this study, it is assumed that the used fuzzy systems do not violate the universal approximation theorem on the compact set U, which is assumed large enough so that state variables remain within U under closed-loop control. Then, the stability results are achieved in the sense that the state x remains inside U. To satisfy x∈U, it has been assumed that U is chosen sufficiently large such that the state remains inside U under closed-loop control. However, when a large compact set is considered, a large number of fuzzy rules may be required, and increasing the number of rules will increase the computational complexity. Therefore, the designer must consider a tradeoff between the number of fuzzy rules and the computational complexity. This implies that certain approximation errors are unavoidable. In this study, we will design a robust controller to cancel the approximation errors.Assumption 4ωfi, ωg1ii, ωgdi, ωg1ijare all bounded, respectively.Denoteu¯ˆd*=gˆd1(x|θˆgd1*)⋮gˆdp(x|θˆgdp*).With above definition and recalling thats¯Tu¯d=sTusign, Eq. (37) can be written as follows(38)sTs˙=−sTK0s+∑i=1pϕfiTξfi(x)si+∑i=1pϕg1iiTξg1ii(x)si2u0+2∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1pϕg1ijTξg1ij(x)sisju0+∑i=1pϕgdiTξgdi(x)|si|−sT(G(x)d(u)+usign)−ur+u0ur2+Ωwhere(39)Ω=sT(Fˆ(x|θˆf*)−F(x))+sT(Gˆ1(x|θˆg1*)−G1(x))su0+μsTsu0+s¯T(u¯d−u¯ˆd*).Using Assumption 4, one knows that there exist unknown constantsω¯fi,ω¯g1ii,ω¯gdi, andω¯g1ijsuch that|ωfi(x)|≤ω¯fi,|ωg1ii(x)|≤ω¯g1ii,|ωgdi(x)|≤ω¯gdi, and|ωg1ij(x)|≤ω¯g1ij. In order to compensate for the lumped errors, the dynamic equations of urare designed as follows(40)u˙r=−αu0ur+α(1−urur2+σ2ϒ)(41)σ˙=−βσur2+σ2ϒwhere α>0, β>0, ur(0)≠0, and(42)ϒ=∥s∥ɛˆf+∥s∥2(ɛˆg+μ)|u0|whereɛˆfandɛˆgare the estimates of∑i=1p(ω¯fi+ω¯gdi)and∑i=1pω¯g1ii+2∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1pω¯g1ij, respectively.Remark 5It is impossible to be well-defined for the dynamic robust controller in [21,22], because the dynamic equations cannot guarantee that urand σ can be away from zero simultaneously. In this study, the dynamic Eqs. (40) and (41) are all well-defined, and the control law (34) is also well-defined. Evidently, if ∥s∥≠0, the dynamic Eq. (40) does not have zero solution; if ∥s∥=0, from (34) and (40), one hasu˙r=0, thus for all t≥0, uris a constant [47]. Since ur(0)≠0, then uris a nonzero constant.We use the following adaptation laws to adjust the unknown parametersθˆfi,θˆg1ii,θˆgdi,θˆg1ij,ɛˆf, andɛˆg:(43)θˆ˙fi=−ηfiξfi(x)si(i=1,2,…,p)(44)θˆ˙g1ii=−ηg1iiξg1ii(x)si2u0(i=1,2,…,p)(45)θˆ˙gdi=ηgdiξgdi(x)|si|(i=1,2,…,p)(46)θˆ˙g1ij=−2ηg1ijξg1ijsisju0(i=1,2,⋯,p−1,j=i+1,⋯,p)(47)ɛˆ˙f=γf∥s∥(48)ɛˆ˙g=γg∥s∥2|u0|where ηfi>0, ηg1ii>0, ηgdi>0, ηg1ij>0, γf>0, and γg>0.The property of the designed control scheme is summarized by the following theorem.Theorem 1Given that the plant defined by (1) satisfies Assumptions 1–4, the control law(35), with dynamic robust controller ur, and the adaptation laws(43)–(48)will ensure that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and that the tracking errors converge asymptotically to zero.ProofLet us consider the following Lyapunov function candidate:(49)V=V1+V2where(50)V1=12sTs+12∑i=1p1ηfiϕfiTϕfi+12∑i=1p1ηg1iiϕg1iiTϕg1ii+12∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1p1ηg1ijϕg1ijTϕg1ij+12∑i=1p1ηgdiϕgdiTϕgdi(51)V2=12γfɛf2+12γgɛg2+12αur2+12βσ2whereɛf=ɛˆf−∑i=1p(ω¯fi+ω¯gdi),ɛg=ɛˆg−(∑i=1pω¯g1ii+2∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1pω¯g1ij).The time derivative of V1 is(52)V˙1=sTs˙+∑i=1p1ηfiϕfiTθˆ˙fi+1ηg1iiϕg1iiTθˆ˙g1ii+∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1p1ηg1ijϕg1ijTθˆ˙g1ij−∑i=1p1ηgdiϕgdiTθˆ˙gdi.Substituting (38) and the adaptive laws (43)–(46) into (52), and after some manipulations, one gets(53)V˙1=−sTK0s−ur+u0ur2−sT(G(x)d(u)+usign)+Ω.Using (39) one has(54)Ω≤∥s∥∑i=1p(ω¯fi+ω¯gdi)+∥s∥2∑i=1pω¯g1ii+2∑i=1p−1∑j=i+1pω¯g1ij+μ|u0|=−∥s∥ɛf−∥s∥2ɛg|u0|+ϒ.Substituting (54) into (53) yields(55)V˙1≤−sTK0s−ur+u0ur2−sT(G(x)d(u)+usign)−∥s∥ɛf−∥s∥2ɛg|u0|+ϒ.The time derivative of V2 is(56)V˙2=1γfɛfɛˆ˙f+1γgɛgɛˆ˙g+1αuru˙r+1βσσ˙.Using the dynamic Eqs. (40) and (41), the adaption laws (47)–(48), and after some manipulations yields(57)V˙2=ur−u0ur2+∥s∥ɛf+∥s∥2ɛg|u0|−ϒ.Combining (55) and (57) gives(58)V˙≤−sTK0s=−∑i=1pk0isi2.From (58), it is concluded that the signals si, ϕfi, ϕgij,ϕgdi, ɛf, ɛg, ur, and σ are bounded.Integrating both sides of (58), one obtains∫0t∑i=1pk0isi2dτ≤V(0)−V(t).This implies si∈L2. Since uris bounded, from (34) we can conclude the boundedness of u0 and u. Since F(x) and G(x) are continuous, and all the variables on the right side of (36) are bounded, one hass˙i∈L∞. Since si∈L2⋂L∞ ands˙i∈L∞, by using Babalat's lemma [48] it is concluded thatlimt→∞si(t)=0which implies that the tracking errors converge asymptotically to zero.□To summarize, Fig. 1shows the overall scheme of the adaptive fuzzy control proposed in this study.Consider an MIMO nonlinear system with a nonsymmetric control gain matrix and unknown dead-zone inputs. The dynamic equations of this system are given byx˙11=x12x˙12=x21−0.3sin(x11x12)+x122+(3+cos(x11)+cos(x12))Γ1(u1)+(1+x222)Γ2(u2)x˙21=x22x˙22=x11+x122+x222−(cos(x12)+cos(x22))Γ1(u1)+(1+x212+x22)Γ2(u2)y1=x11,y2=x21.The ith unknown dead-zone is described byΓi(ui(t))=mi(ui(t)−bri),forui(t)≥bri0,forbli<ui(t)<brimi(ui(t)−bli),forui(t)≤bli.Denotedi(ui(t))=−mibri,forui(t)≥bri−miui(t),forbli<ui(t)<bri−mibli,forui(t)≤bli.Let y=[y1, y2]T, Γ=[Γ1(u1), Γ2(u2)]T, u=[u1, u2]T, x=[x11, x12, x21, x22]T, B=diag[m1, m2], d(u)=[d1(u1(t)), d2(u2(t))]TF(x)=x21−0.3sin(x11x12)+x122x11+x122+x222G(x)=3+cos(x11)+cos(x12)1+x222−(cos(x12)+cos(x22))1+x212+x22then, the dynamic system can be expressed as followsy¨=F(x)+G(x)Bu+G(x)d(u)which is in the form given by (7).The control objective is to force the system outputs y1 and y2 to track the desired sinusoidal trajectories ym1(t)=sin(t) and ym2(t)=sin(t), respectively.Suppose that there are no a priori knowledge of the system nonlinearities and the dead-zone, i.e., the nonlinear functions fi(x) and gij(x), the constants mianddi*, are assumed to be completely unknown. Two fuzzy systems in the form of (27) are used to approximate the elements of F(x), three are used to approximate the elements of G1(x), and two are used to approximate the elements ofu¯d. The fuzzy systems have x11, x12, x21 and x22 as inputs. The overall state vector is x=[x1, x2, x3, x4]T=[x11, x12, x21, x22]T. To compare our scheme with [21], the fuzzy membership functions for each variable xi(i=1, ⋯, 4) are the same as those used in [21]μFi1(xi)=exp−12xi+1.250.62μFi2(xi)=exp−12xi0.62μFi3(xi)=exp−12xi−1.250.62.The lth fuzzy rule is constructed asRl:IFx1isF1k1and⋯andx4isF4k4,THENyisGlwhereFikiand Glare fuzzy sets, ki=1, 2, 3, i=1, …, 4, l=1, 2, …, m, and m=34=81 is the total number of rules whose IF parts comprise all the possible combinations of theFiki,sfor i=1, 2, …, 4.Denote j=33(k1−1)+32(k2−1)+3(k3−1)+k4, then for ki=1, 2, 3, i=1, …, 4, j∈{1, 2, …, 81}. Collect j in the ordering for j=1, 2, …, 81, and letξj(x)=μF1k1(x1)μF2k2(x2)μF3k3(x3)μF4k4(x4)∑j=181μF1k1(x1)μF2k2(x2)μF3k3(x3)μF4k4(x4)thenξ(x)=[ξ1(x),…,ξ81(x)]T. In this simulation, fuzzy basic functions ξfi(x), ξg1ii(x), ξg1ij(x), and ξgdi(x) are all chosen as ξ(x), and one hasfˆi(x|θˆfi)=θˆfiTξ(x),gˆ1ii(x|θˆg1ii)=θˆg1iiTξ(x),gˆdi(x|θˆgdi)=θˆgdiTξ(x)(i=1,2),gˆ112(x|θˆg112)=θˆg112Tξ(x)Fˆ(x|θˆf)=[fˆ1(x|θˆf1),fˆ2(x|θˆf2)]TGˆ1(x|θˆg1)=gˆ111(x|θˆg111)gˆ112(x|θˆg112)gˆ112(x|θˆg112)gˆ122(x|θˆg122)u¯ˆd=gˆd1(x|θˆgd1)gˆd2(x|θˆgd2).The controller u0 is constructed asu0=−sTFˆ(x|θˆf)+sTv+sTK0s+s¯Tu¯ˆd+ursTGˆ1(x|θˆg)s+μsTs+ur2.The dynamic equations of urare constructed asu˙r=−αu0ur+α(1−urur2+σ2ϒ)σ˙=−βσur2+σ2ϒwhereϒ=∥s∥ɛˆf+∥s∥2(ɛˆg+μ)|u0|.The controller is constructed asu=su0.The adaptive laws are constructed asθˆ˙fi=−ηfiξ(x)si(i=1,2)θˆ˙g1ii=−ηg1iiξg1ii(x)si2u0(i=1,2)ɛˆ˙f=γf∥s∥ɛˆ˙g=γg∥s∥2|u0|θˆ˙gdi=ηgdiξgdi(x)|si|(i=1,2)θˆ˙g112=−2ηg112ξg112s1s2u0.In this simulation, the parameters of the dead-zone model are selected as follows: br1=br2=2, bl1=bl2=1.25, m1=m2=2. The initial conditions are x(0)=[0.5, 0, 0.25, 0]T, and the initial values of the estimated parametersθˆfi(0),θˆg1ii(0),θˆgdi(0)(i=1,2),ɛˆf(0),ɛˆg(0),θˆg112(0)are all set to zero, while σ(0)=0.1, ur(0)=0.1.The design parameters are selected as α=0.005, β=0.001, k01=7, k02=7, λ1=15, λ2=15, ηfi=0.5, ηg1ii=0.5, ηgdi=0.5, for i=1, 2, ηg112=0.5, γf=0.001, γg=0.001, and ɛ=0.1.Using our fuzzy adaptive control scheme to control the above MIMO nonlinear system, the simulation results are shown in Figs. 2–10. The tracking errors are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It can be observed that the system outputs can track the reference signals, i.e., a good tracking performance is achieved. The control signals are presented in Fig. 4. The norms of adaptive parameters are illustrated in Figs. 5–8. The evolution of other parameters are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. It can be seen that all the signals are bounded.From this simulation results, it is clear that even though the exact information on the nonlinear functions in the systems is not available and the dead-zone inputs are unknown, the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller guarantees both the stability and good tracking performance of the closed-loop system.It is noted that the dynamic robust controller uris designed to compensate for the lumped errors, thus the selection of the parameter α can highly affect the control performance of the closed-loop system. To observer the variety of closed-loop system control performance for the different design parameter, one selects α=0.05, while other design parameters are the same as the corresponding design parameters used in above simulation. As a comparison, the corresponding simulation results are shown in Figs. 11–13. From Figs. 11 and 12, one can observe that the different tracking performance can be obtained by tunning the design parameter α. According to Figs. 2–4, 11–13, one obtains that the tracking error could be decreased by increasing the value of α, but this increase would also increase the control signal in the transient phase.Remark 6There are a total of 34×4 parameters for matrixGˆ(x|θˆg)need to be updated on-line in [21], whereas the number of parameters forGˆ1(x|θˆg)is only equal to 34×3 in our scheme due to the fact that the symmetric characteristic of matrix G1(x) has been considered. Thus, less parameters in our scheme help to make the proposed algorithm computationally more efficient. Moreover, the schemes of [21] needs an assumption that the gain matrix is symmetric and the control direction is known a priori, whereas in our scheme this assumption has been removed. In addition, compared with [25,26], the general case that the indefinite control gain matrix has been taken into account.In the previous simulation, to compare our scheme with the scheme in [21], the fuzzy membership functions for each variable xi(i=1, …, 4) are selected the same as those used in [21]. However, another fuzzy membership functions can be designed for simulation. For instance, one selects the following fuzzy membership functions for each variable xi(i=1, …, 4)μFi1(xi)=exp−12xi+1.20.62μFi2(xi)=exp−12xi+0.60.62μFi3(xi)=exp−12xi0.62μFi4(xi)=exp−12xi−0.60.62μFi5(xi)=exp−12xi−1.20.62.In the following simulation, the control objective, the parameters of the dead-zone model, the initial conditions, the initial values of the estimated parameters, and the design parameters are all the same as those used in the previous simulation.The simulation results are shown in Figs. 14–22. The tracking errors are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. The control signals are presented in Fig. 16. The norms of adaptive parameters are illustrated in Figs. 17–20. The evolution of other parameters are shown in Figs. 21 and 22.It is obvious that the tracking performance of this simulation is better than that of the previous simulation, because the number of fuzzy rules is 54=625 in this simulation, while the number of fuzzy rules is 34=81 in the previous simulation. However, the computational burden of this simulation is larger than that of the previous simulation.It is very important to notice that in practice the choice of fuzzy membership functions is a compromise between the number of fuzzy rules and the computational complexity.
