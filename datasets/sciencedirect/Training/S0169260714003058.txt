@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study developed a computerised method for fovea centre detection in fundus images. In the method, the centre of the optic disc was localised first by the template matching method, the disc–fovea axis (a line connecting the optic disc centre and the fovea) was then determined by searching the vessel-free region, and finally the fovea centre was detected by matching the fovea template around the centre of the axis. Adaptive Gaussian templates were used to localise the centres of the optic disc and fovea for the images with different resolutions. The proposed method was evaluated using three publicly available databases (DIARETDB0, DIARETDB1 and MESSIDOR), which consisted of a total of 1419 fundus images with different resolutions. The proposed method obtained the fovea detection accuracies of 93.1%, 92.1% and 97.8% for the DIARETDB0, DIARETDB1 and MESSIDOR databases, respectively. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was 97.0% in this study.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The fovea is a part of the eye located in the centre of the macular region of the retina, and is responsible for sharp central vision. In a fundus image, a dark circular area represents the macula, and the fovea is located at the centre of the dark region. Damage to the macular region would cause vision loss or blindness. The lesions located close to the fovea would cause more serious damage, and the distance between the lesions and the fovea has clinical relevance to the extent of damage [1]. Hence, for automated analysis of the fundus retinal images, detection of the fovea is essential.Several methods for the fovea detection have been proposed, most of which were performed in two stages. In the first stage, a constraining region was defined for searching the fovea. In the second stage, an algorithm for the fovea detection was applied in the defined region. In addition to the two-stage approach, Niemeijer et al. [2] proposed a method to directly obtain the fovea location by a point distribution model; Singh et al. [3] proposed an appearance-based method for fovea detection; Kovacs et al. [4] presented a framework that used a combination of different methods for fovea detection.In the two-stage approach, constraining the search area in the first stage could reduce the computation time and avoid the disturbance from other anatomic structures. Most of the methods for constraining the search area used the information on the optic disc, namely the optic disc diameter and the optic disc centre. It assumed that the fovea is located at a distance that is approximately 2.5 times the optic disc diameter from the optic disc centre. These constraining methods can be categorised into three types: (1) using the training method to find the search area [5]; (2) constraining a region with the fixed location relative to the optic disc centre [6–11]; (3) constraining a region with the adaptive location based on the vascular information [12–16]. Besides constraining the search area, the algorithms to precisely locate the fovea in the second stage can also be divided into four categories: (1) template matching based method [17,18]; (2) thresholding based method [6,9,12,16]; (3) minimum-density based method [7,8,10,11,14]; (4) feature based method [5,15].Constraining the search region with the fixed location relative to the optic disc centre may pose problem when the fovea does not locate nearby the centre of a fundus image (the location of the fovea is far from the horizontal line passing through the centre of the optic disc). This problem could be solved by constraining the search region with the adaptive location based on the vascular information. However, obtaining vascular information needs segmentation of the vessels and is time-consuming. In this study, a two-stage method was proposed for the fovea centre detection, which constrained the search region adaptively without segmentation of the vessels. In the first stage, the proposed method constrained the search region with the adaptive location based on the vessel-free region and did not need the segmentation of vessels. In the second stage, an adaptive Gaussian template was used to localise the fovea centre in the search region for the images with different resolutions. Three publicly available databases with different resolutions were used to evaluate the method, and the fovea detection accuracy was assessed in this study.The proposed method was evaluated on three publicly available databases: DIARETDB0 [19], DIARETDB1 [20] and MESSIDOR [21]. The DIARETDB0 and DIARETDB1 databases consisted of 130 and 89 colour fundus images with a size of 1500 by 1152 pixels. The MESSIDOR database (1200 fundus images) included 588, 400 and 212 images with a size of 1440×960, 2240×1488 and 2304×1536 pixels, respectively. Each pixel in a colour fundus image included three components, namely red, green and blue. The value of each component was quantised to 256 grey levels. The fundus images with different resolutions were used to evaluate the proposed method in this study.The overall scheme of the proposed method for the fovea centre detection is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the first step, a fundus image is processed to obtain the information used in the following steps. In the second step, the optic disc centre is localised. In the third step, the disc–fovea axis is determined, based on the vessel-free region. Finally, the fovea centre is localised around the centre of the disc–fovea axis. Each step of the proposed method is described in detail as follows.To localise the fovea centre, some derivative images and information need to be obtained by processing the original fundus image. These derivative images and information, which would be used in the following procedures, are described and defined in this section.A colour fundus image comprises red, green and blue components. In this study, the green component of the image I(x,y) was used to detect the fovea centre, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Because only the pixels in the field of view (FOV) need to be used, the FOV mask was first obtained. The values of the pixels outside the field of view were close to zero. A threshold value, Tmask, was determined from the histogram of the green component image by searching a minimum point between 0 and 50, as shown in Fig. 2(b). A binary image was then obtained by thresholding the green component image with Tmask, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Because only the pixels in the bright region (FOV) were needed, the green component image was masked by the binary image, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The masked green component image was used for the fovea detection by the following procedures.After determining the FOV mask, the diameter (DFOV) and the centre (XFOV, YFOV) of FOV can be further determined, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Assuming the area of the bright region as A, the diameter of FOV could be determined by2×A/π, and the centre of FOV could be determined by the mass centre of the bright region. In this study, DFOV was used as a reference length for normalisation between the images of different resolutions.In addition to the green component image containing the density information, another derivative image containing the gradient information was used in this study. Fig. 3(b) demonstrates a gradient image by applying gradient operation to a green component image in Fig. 3(a). The operation of the gradient is defined by Eq. (1):(1)Igradient(x,y)=|I(x−1,y+1)+I(x,y+1)+I(x+1,y+1)−I(x−1,y−1)−I(x,y−1)−I(x+1,y−1)|+|I(x+1,y−1)+I(x+1,y)+I(x+1,y+1)−I(x−1,y−1)−I(x−1,y)−I(x−1,y+1)|In addition to the blood vessels, the FOV boundary, the optic disc and the exudates (bright lesions) have large gradient values, as shown in Fig. 3(b). These structures with large gradient values may pose problems for subsequent procedures and need to be eliminated. For the elimination of large gradient values corresponding to the FOV boundary, a mask can be used by applying the erosion operation to the mask shown in Fig. 2(c). The erosion operation causes the mask to shrink inward by 6 pixels, and the large gradient values corresponding to the FOV boundary fall outside the mask. Therefore, the shrunken mask can eliminate the large gradient values.For the large gradient values corresponding to the exudates and the optic disc, the use of another mask is necessary. From our observations, the exudates and the optic disc are characterised by a yellowish colour. A mask obtained by applying the colour information was used to eliminate the large gradient values corresponding to the exudates and the optic disc. To obtain the mask, the RGB colour co-ordinate was converted to the HSI colour co-ordinate [22]. The H value represents the hue of colour; when H=0°, the colour is red; when H=60°, the colour is yellow. The yellowish colour of the exudates and the optic disc should correspond with an H value larger than that for the background and the blood vessels. To mask the pixels with large H values, the mean (μH) and standard deviation (ρH) of H values in a fundus image were determined, along with threshold (μH+ρH). The threshold was used to obtain a mask for large H values, as shown in Fig. 3(c).Finally, the shrunken mask for the FOV boundary and the mask for large H values were used to eliminate the corresponding pixels to obtain the masked gradient image, as shown in Fig. 3(d).The method proposed in this study was based on the template matching method. The templates used for detecting the fovea and the optic disc centre were constructed by Gaussian functions. A 2-D Gaussian function is expressed in Eq. (2):(2)f(x,y)=e−((x−x0)2/2σx2+(y−y0)2/2σy2)where x0, y0 is the centre and σxand σyare the standard deviations in the x and y directions. The standard deviations, σxand σy, control the width of the bell shape in the x and y directions and are the parameters to be deduced for the templates. For a 1-D Gaussian distribution function, the relationship [23] between the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the standard deviation (σ) is described by Eq. (3):(3)FWHM=22ln2σ≈2.35482σThis relationship was used to determine the standard deviations of the Gaussian functions for the templates used in this study. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates a profile intersecting the fovea centre, and FWHM for the fovea can be obtained by analysing the profile. FWHM for the optic disc can be similarly obtained. To overcome drawbacks associated with images of different resolutions, the length used in this study was normalised to FOV diameter (DFOV). Following the analysis of 100 fundus images with different resolutions, the ratio between DFOV and FWHM for the fovea (FWHMfovea) was 14.4±2.2 (FWHMfovea=DFOV/14.4) and the ratio between DFOV and FWHM for the optic disc (FWHMOD) was 13.2±2.8 (FWHMOD=DFOV/13.2). To further determine the standard deviations obtained by Eq. (3) for the fovea and the optic disc, the following equations were applied:(4)σfovea≈DFOV34(5)σOD≈DFOV31Using the results described above, the fovea template was constructed by a Gaussian function, with the standard deviation of DFOV/34 as defined by Eq. (6):(6)Tfovea(x,y)=255−255×e−((x2/2σfovea2)+(y2/2σfovea2))Subsequently, the optic disc template was constructed by a Gaussian function, with the standard deviation of DFOV/31 as defined by Eq. (7):(7)TOD(x,y)=255×e−((x2/2σOD2)+(y2/2σOD2))In Eqs. (6) and (7), the constant value, 255, is the dynamic range of a green component image. From our observations, the optic disc or the macular region could be covered with the Gaussian template sized at 2FWHM×2FWHM entirely. The optic disc template with a size of 2FWHMOD×2FWHMOD was constructed to cover with the optic disc. However, the fovea is located at the centre of the dark region in the macula. To localise the fovea centre precisely, instead of using the template with a size of 2FWHMfovea×2FWHMfovea to cover with the macular region, the fovea template was constructed with a size of FWHMfovea×FWHMfovea to cover the dense region around the fovea in this study. The examples of the templates for the fovea and optic disc are demonstrated in Fig. 4(b).To define the region for seeking the fovea centre, the centre of the optic disc was initially determined by matching the optic disc template in the two regions, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The correlation value at each location for matching the optic disc is defined by Eq. (8):(8)COD(x,y)=1(2FWHMOD)2∑i=−FWHMODFWHMOD∑j=−FWHMODFWHMOD(I(x+i,y+j)−I¯)(TOD(i,j)−T¯OD)σIσTODwhereI¯=12(FWHMOD)2∑i=−FWHMODFWHMOD∑j=−FWHMODFWHMODI(x+i,y+j),T¯OD=1(2FWHMOD)2∑i=−FWHMODFWHMOD∑j=−FWHMODFWHMODTOD(i,j),σI=∑i=−FWHMODFWHMOD∑j=−FWHMODFWHMOD(I(x+i,y+j)−I¯)2(2FWHMOD)2,σTOD=∑i=−FWHMODFWHMOD∑j=−FWHMODFWHMOD(TOD(i,j)−T¯OD)2(2FWHMOD)2Among the two search regions, the location at which the correlation value COD is maximum was used as the centre of the optic disc and the side (left or right) on which the optic disc locates in a fundus image was also determined at the same time, as shown in Fig. 5(b).Following the location of the optic disc centre, the direction of the fovea relative to the optic disc was determined to be a precise area in which the fovea lies. Li and Chutatape [12], Tobin et al. [13] and Fleming et al. [14] have proposed the methods for determining the direction by indirectly modelling blood vessels. Our proposed method directly detected the direction in this study without the segmentation of blood vessels. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the disc–fovea axis, a line connecting the optic disc and the fovea, would lie in a region without blood vessels. This feature was used in determining the direction of the fovea relative to the optic disc in this study. The direction was determined using the lines originating from the optic disc centre to the FOV boundary to scan the masked gradient image in different directions, and the scans were performed from −20° to 20°, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The mean gradient value Gm for each line was calculated by averaging the pixels on each line in the masked gradient image. Fig. 6(c) shows the distribution of Gm in the different directions. The passage of the scanning line through the vessels would result in a large Gm value, which would otherwise be small for the vessel-free region. Hence, a line with a minimum Gm was used as the disc–fovea axis in this study, as shown in Fig. 6(d).The fovea centre was determined in the last step. Fig. 7(a) demonstrates that the centre of the disc–fovea axis was close to the fovea centre. For the precise localisation of the fovea centre, the template matching method was further applied in a small region with a size of 4FWHMfovea×4FWHMfovea around the centre of the axis. The correlation value between the fovea template and the subimage with a size of FWHMfovea×FWHMfovea at each location is defined by Eq. (9):(9)Cfovea(x,y)=1FWHMfovea2∑i=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2∑j=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2(I(x+i,y+j)−I¯)(Tfovea(i,j)−T¯fovea)σIσTfoveawhereI¯=1FWHMfovea2∑i=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2∑j=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2I(x+i,y+j),T¯fovea=1FWHMfovea2∑i=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2∑j=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2Tfovea(i,j)σI=∑i=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2∑j=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2(I(x+i,y+j)−I¯)2FWHMfovea2,σTfovea=∑i=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2∑j=−FWHMfovea/2FWHMfovea/2(Tfovea(i,j)−T¯fovea)2FWHMfovea2In the search region, the location corresponding to the maximum correlation value was considered as the fovea centre in this study, as shown in Fig. 7(b).A specialist annotated the location of the fovea centre for each fundus image used in this study by using software developed in-house, as shown in Fig. 8(a). For those images without a visible fovea, the expert estimated the locations. These annotated locations were then used as the gold standards to evaluate the proposed method. In the present study, we measured the accuracy of the proposed method based on the target, which represents the relative location between the detected locations and the gold standards, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The centre of the target was the location for the gold standards, whereas the errors, which were determined by the distance between the detected locations and the gold standards, would be distributed around the centre. In the current study, an error smaller than FWHMfovea/2 (≈DFOV/28) was considered to be a success in fovea detection, if not, the detection was deemed to have failed. Thus, a successfully detected location would fall inside the dense area of the macula and within the circle with a radius of FWHMfovea/2, as shown in Fig. 8.
