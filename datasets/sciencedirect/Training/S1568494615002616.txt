@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with the rehabilitation purposes using an active orthosis driven by an adaptive neural controller based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Two essential conditions are required in our study: ensuring the wearer safety and the good trajectory tracking. We consider for our experiments the same movements often recommended by the doctor during therapy sessions. In this context, it is possible to add some trivial prior knowledge as the dynamic model structure and all dynamical identified parts. The unknown or the uncertainty part of the inertia term of the knee-shank-orthosis system is identified online using an adaptive term. All other uncertainties or unknown dynamics are identified online by the RBFNN. The Lyapunov approach has been used to derive adaptation laws of the neural parameters and the inertia term. These adaptation laws ensure the stability of the system composed of the exoskeleton and its wearer. The wearer can be completely inactive or applying either a resistive or an assistive effort. Experimental results have been conducted on a real exoskeleton that is used for rehabilitation reasons. Based on these results we conclude with the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Exoskeletons are increasingly developed in the literature and are designed to solve several problems that may be encountered by humans [1–3]. In fact, every person is not immune to an accident or a pathology causing him a partial/total impairment of its movement. He can become paraplegic for example [4–6]. Exoskeletons can be used to reduce the degree of dependence with regard to this kind of situations. They are also used in the field of rehabilitation of lower and/or upper limbs. Out deficiencies that can happen to human, exoskeletons can be used to improve comfort and assist him in its various daily tasks (gardening, carry heavy loads, climb stairs, walk longer, etc.). An exoskeleton may concern a single part of the body (arm, knee, pelvis, etc.) or it may concern several parts of the body at the same time (both feet with the pelvis for instance). Exoskeletons have been considered for several purposes and we summarize here some of them. The Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology has designed an exoskeleton to assist its wearer to realize farming work that is considered as tough. In the context of military applications, Hercule has been developed in the goal to improve the performances of soldiers. Moreover, one can find in references [7–9] a good state of the art on exoskeletons and their applications.Generally, it is not possible to establish an accurate dynamic model that takes account of dynamic changes related to the wearer's desired movements. Indeed, the wearer can be completely inactive or apply either an assistive or a resistive torque. On the other hand, the exoskeleton can be used for rehabilitation of a class of humans, which have different morphologies and haven’t the same behavior. In the goal of considering these situations, adaptive controllers represent one of several solutions widely studied in literature [10–12]. Training techniques like neural networks are ones of those considered in designing of these adaptive controllers [13,14]. In the work proposed previously in [15] using Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), we have considered the system as a black box. Consequently, the MLPNN inputs are composed of joint position, joint velocity and joint acceleration. In the goal to reduce the control complexity, we have ignored the acceleration from the MLPNN inputs considering the possibility to reconstruct it implicitly. On the other hand, the convergence study concerns only the joint position and the case of a priori knowledge has not been discussed. Concerning the new proposed approach in this paper, which is of grey box type, it allows to separate inertia dynamics from the other dynamics as frictions, gravity, etc. The used neural network is of RBFNN type and no linearization is needed to get adaptation laws and the measure of the acceleration is not needed. The stability study of the system in closed loop concerns both the joint position and the joint velocity. In addition, the proposed controller algorithm makes it possible to introduce any prior knowledge. In [16], a RBFNN and composite learning is used to propose a precise position control of tubular linear motors. Uncertainties such as friction and other electro-magnetic phenomena are approximated using a RBFNN, which is trained online using a learning law based on Lyapunov approach. Compared to other approaches in literature, this approximation method uses a composite adaptation law based on a model prediction error and the tracking error. Generally, if there is some prior knowledge relative to the system dynamics, classical adaptive approaches can be used adding a robustness part that takes into account any other unmodelled dynamic. Adaptive techniques offer the possibility of adaptation to any changes that can happen during the use of the system. For instance, one can cite servo systems [17], inferential sensors [18], networks [19], etc. In the neural connectionist techniques, controllers can have fixed or adaptive parameters. For fixed parameters neural networks [20], a robustness term is often considered in order to take account of dynamic changes. Whereas in adaptive parameters neural networks, we use adaptation laws that can, for instance, be derived from the system's overall stability study [21]. The advantage of neural networks is the possibility of incorporating some prior knowledge about the system to be controlled. Indeed, the dynamic model structure of robotic systems is generally known, which allows us to associate to neural networks, adaptive control approaches that have proven efficient. Also, we can consider any prior identified part about the dynamic model and add it without any problem into the controller scheme. The neural network by its characteristic of universal approximation has to identify other non-identified dynamics only and that can change while executing movements. By this manner, any undesirable behavior is avoided and the adaptation step is very little and we can simply neglect it because it has no effect on the wearer of the orthosis, which necessitate a high security.In literature of artificial learning tools, it has been proven that both MLPNN and RBFNN can approximate any unknown nonlinear function [22–24]. These connectionist tools have widely been used in the area of nonlinear control systems [11,25]. Unlike a MLPNN that has the characteristic to learn globally, a RBFNN has the property to learn locally and for this reason it can have a very faster convergence. In the case of systems having a reduced number of entries, RBFNNs are better suited for the approximation procedure [26]. In [27] other advantages of the RBFNN compared to the MLPNN, as its rapid convergence for instance, are also given.In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling an orthosis intended to the knee joint rehabilitation. Our solution for this problem is based on RBFNN with only the knowledge of the structure of the dynamic model of the system. It is also possible to include in the proposed controller, a nominal model representing all other knowledge on the system. This can be done without affecting the stability of the closed loop system. This article is an extension of the simulation work published in [28].The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the knee-shank-orthosis system modeling, its structure and the dynamics to be approximated by the RBFNN. Section 3 explains the neural approximation principle and the activation functions. In Section 4, we give an analysis that can be useful for any work of identification of dynamic parameters of the system. However, our approach does not require identification results. In Section 5, the proposed RBFNN controller and the stability analysis of the closed loop system are detailed. Section 6 deals with the experimental results and their analysis. Finally we conclude in Section 7.A person wearing the orthosis in a sitting position with the shank freely moving around the knee joint represents the considered system for our experimentations. The orthosis is composed of two jointed segments, upper and lower. The actuator and the mechanical part are placed on the upper part of the orthosis. The torque generated by the orthosis permits to realize flexion/extension movements of the lower part composed by the shank of the wearer and the lower part of the orthosis. For security reason, the knee joint is constrained by a range of motion between 0° and 135°. In Fig. 1, we present a wearer of the orthosis in standing position.The joint of the orthosis is actuated by a brushless DC motor (BLDC). A power supply and an adequate electrical system are used to provide the regulation for the current in the motor. A mechanical transmission is used to increase the orthosis applied torque. Fig. 2shows the schematic diagram of the used electromechanical system.According to regulation system characteristics of the BLDC motor and as the time constant of the electrical system is unimportant compared to the mechanical time constant [29], we can write the following equation:(1)τ=βmuwhere u is the electrical current of the BLDC motor, τ is the applied torque and βmis a positive constant.Fig. 3gives the mechanical structure scheme of the considered active orthosis. Letα,α˙andα¨, respectively represent the angular position, the angular velocity and the angular acceleration of the knee joint-orthosis in the sagittal plane. Where 0 corresponds to the full knee extension andπ2radrepresents the resting position.According to the dynamic fundamental principle of solids in rotary motion, it comes:(2)Jα¨=∑τiwith J is the total inertia and τiare the applied torques to the knee-orthosis joint. The set of joint applied torques are formed by the actuated orthosis torque τ, the human knee joint torque τk, the gravitational torque τg, the resistive viscous friction torqueτv, the resistive solid friction torque τsand the disturbance torque τdwhich includes all unmodelled dynamics. From (2), we obtain the following dynamic model:(3)Jα¨=τ+τk+τd+mglcos(α)︸τg−kvα˙︸τv−kssgn(α˙)︸τswhere g is the gravitational acceleration andkvis the viscous friction coefficient, ksis the solid friction coefficient, m is the mass and l is the length. The dynamic model equation can be written as follows:(4)τ+τk=Jα¨+V(α˙)+S(α˙)−G(α)−τdwhere•J=Jor+Jk: inertia of the system (orthosis (or)+knee of the human (k)).G(α)=τg=Gor(α)+Gk(α): gravitational torque.S(α˙)=τs=Sor(α˙)+Sk(α˙): solid friction torque.V(α˙)=τv=Vor(α˙)+Vk(α˙): viscous friction torque.α: actual joint position.α˙: actual joint velocity.α¨: actual joint acceleration.From Eq. (1), the dynamic model (4) is rewritten as follows:βmu+τk=Jα¨+V(α˙)+S(α˙)−G(α)−τdu+τkβm=Jβmα¨+V(α˙)βm+S(α˙)βm−G(α)βm−τdβmTo simplify the writing, let us consider:τkβ=τkβmτdβ=τdβmJβ=JβmJ0β=J0βmJ1β=J1βmVβ=V(α˙)βmV0β=V0(α˙)βmV1β=V1(α˙)βmSβ=S(α˙)βmS0β=S0(α˙)βmS1β=S1(α˙)βmGβ=G(α)βmG0β=G0(α)βmG1β=G1(α)βmwhere J0β, S0β, V0βand G0βare the identified parts and J1β, S1β, V1βand G1βrepresent non identified parts. As the current represents the control input, finally the dynamic model is expressed as:(5)u+τkβ=Jβα¨+Vβ+Sβ−Gβ−τdβJβ=J0β+J1βSβ=S0β+S1βVβ=V0β+V1βGβ=G0β+G1βWe assume otherwise that we have a nominal dynamic model (identified by an appropriate method for instance), so we can write:u+τkβ=(J0β+J1β)α¨+S0β+S1β+V0β+V1β−G0β−G1β−τdβ=J0βα¨+S0β+V0β−G0β+J1βα¨+S1β+V1β−G1β−τdβIf the identification is perfect, so we have:J1β=0S1β=0V1β=0G1β=0Jβ=J0βSβ=S0βVβ=V0βGβ=G0βEq. (5) can be re-written as follows:(6)u=J0βα¨+γ0(α,α˙)+J1βα¨+γ1(α,α˙)−τkβ−τdβwhereγ0(α,α˙)=S0β+V0β−G0βγ1(α,α˙)=S1β+V1β−G1βγ(α,α˙)=γ1(α,α˙)+γ0(α,α˙)In the construction of the proposed neuro-adaptive control law, it is considered that only the structure of the dynamic model is known. This means that Jβand γ are assumed to be partially known (J0βand γ0 are known (identified)).If we have not a prior identified dynamic model, it can be written:Jβ=J1βSβ=S1βVβ=V1βGβ=G1βWith this formulation, all dynamics must be determined by an adaptive approach. For our application realized on a human, it is safer to start with a prior identified model. On the other hand, our formulation gives us the possibility to take account of other unmodelled dynamics. To identify on line the unknown parts of the dynamic model(J1βα¨+γ1(α,α˙))we choose the use of RBF neural networks for their ability to approach non-linear functions.We suppose there exists an optimal neural representation of the functionγ1(w)based on RBFNN having a linear output (Fig. 4).There exists then an optimal vector θ containing the weights between the hidden layer and the neural network's output [1]. Therefore, we can write:(7)γ1(w)=θTϕ(w)+δ(w)wherew=(α,α˙)Tandδ(w)represents the bounded neural approximation error [1]. As there is no method allowing us to exactly determine the vectorθ∈ℝn,1, we use its approximation that we noteθˆ. With this, we can write:γˆ1(w)=θˆTϕ(w)(8)ϕ(w)=e−π∥w−η∥2σ2where:•σ=(σα,σα˙): parameters related to the widths of the used Gaussian functions (Fig. 5(A)).η=(ηα,ηα˙): centers of the Gaussian functions as shown in Fig. 5(B). The number of Gaussians used in each direction α orα˙depends on the intervals of their variations. For example if the positions are in [αmin, αmax], we takeηα1=αminandηαl=αmax. In the same way, if the velocities are in [α˙min,α˙max],we takeηα˙1=α˙minandηα˙m=α˙max. The other centers depend on the quality of sampling in each direction α orα˙.n=l·m is the number of hidden neurons andϕ(w)∈ℝn×1.In order to obtain a linear parameterization, parameters σ, η have to be set to given values. In our case, the centers are arranged in a grid covering the input space. Each two successive centers related to the position α are separated by a distance Δα, and each two successive centers related to the velocityα˙are separated by a distanceΔα˙.In the following section, an experimental identification procedure is conducted to obtain a nominal dynamic model represented by J0β, S0β, V0β, G0β.In the goal to perform a nominal parametric identification of the considered system, we have chosen to use the conventional Least-Square-Error method. This step can be useful to avoid any undesired behavior in the experiment's phase. It is preferable that the used identification database be rich in excitation, to be close to the real dynamic of the system. Generally this database is generated in closed loop using the principle given in Fig. 6.The nonlinear model of the exoskeleton can be seen as a double integrator, considering the nonlinear term, as a perturbation [30]. Then, it makes sense to use linear control techniques to choose the PD values (K1∈ℝ+andK2∈ℝ+). However in our case, the choice of PD values is made heuristically and this approximation manner gives us a global idea to select the PD parameters. In literature when this basic controller is chosen as the main controller, some authors propose improvements in certain phases as in [31] where a fuzzy logic technique has been used to improve transient response of controlled systems. In this section, the goal of the PD controller is not to give good results in terms of trajectory tracking. Its role is only to avoid any undesirable behavior during the database's construction. Furthermore, for the safety reasons, the PD controller has been applied by the use of (in the order):1Exoskeleton alone.Exoskeleton worn by a mannequin.Exoskeleton worn by a human.The dynamic model (6) can be rewritten as follows:u=ΨTΘ+∇where•Θ∈ℝ4a vector of constant parameters:(9)Θ=G¯0βV¯0βS¯0βJ¯0βΨ∈ℝ4is a regression vector function of α,α˙andα¨:(10)Ψ=cos(α)α˙sgn(α˙)α¨∇∈ℝis an additional part representing the unidentified part of the model. It is represented by the dynamicsJ1βα¨+γ1(α,α˙)that will be approximated online by the use of the RBFNN.Several tests were performed on the real system with a healthy wearer weighing 73kg and measuring 1m78. The subject does not apply any muscular effort (τk=0). The obtained data are grouped into twoℝNvectors with 0.001s as sampling time (N is the number of samples in the generated database). The first vector contains the electrical input and the second vector is composed of the measurements of the knee joint position. As the regression vector Ψ depends onα,α˙andα¨, off-line numerical approximations are used to estimate the successive derivatives of the position α.The prediction model chosen for the identification is:(11)uˆ=ΨTΘˆwhereuˆandΘˆare the estimations of u and Θ, respectively.The chosen model (11) is linear in parameters. Therefore, the system can be identified using the least squares method by minimizing the following quadratic distance:(12)d=1N∑i=1Nu˜2(i)whereu˜(i)=u(i)−uˆ(i)is the estimation error at the instant i.The optimal parameter vector is given by the following expression:(13)Θˆ=∑i=1NΨ(i)ΨT(i)−1∑i=1NΨ(i)u(i)where the existence of the inverse matrix is related to the condition of the excitation input.In our various experimentations, we tried to generate a database in open loop according to the protocol described by the previous points 1, 2 and 3. However, to exclude any abnormal behavior of the exoskeleton, we recommend to generate the identification's database in closed loop even if the PD parameters are not well optimized. For indicative purposes, the trajectory tracking in the phase of database's generation is shown in Fig. 7where K1=20 and K2=10. One can notice on this figure, even if the quality of the trajectory tracking is not satisfactory, that the exoskeleton worn by a healthy subject realizes a stable motion.The signals used for the identification application are shown in Fig. 8. One can easily notice the rich excitation of these trajectories. The nominal parameters of the dynamic model obtained (13) are given by:(14)Θˆ=−2.23810.41580.20560.0015Fig. 9shows the comparison between the obtained estimationuˆand the real input u. It can be noticed the relative similarity of the estimation and the real signal. In fact, the estimation error is due to the influence of the non-identified dynamic ∇ that will be approximated by the RBFNN. The proposed identification step has the goal to overcome any random initialization of parameters and so to avoid undesirable behavior of the exoskeleton. Furthermore, it should be noted that the proposed controller is adaptive and it does not necessitate a perfect identification.In this section we have to expose the detail of the proposed adaptive controller ensuring good performances in terms of trajectory tracking, in position and in velocity. We have also to consider different situations that can occur during the execution of such protocol of rehabilitation.The proposed control law is given as follows:(15)u=(J0β+Jˆ1β)v+γ0(w)+γˆ1(w)−KsConsider the following variables:v=α¨d−λe˙e=α−αde˙=α˙−αd˙s=e˙+λe(K>0,λ>0)For the stability study, let us consider the following signals:J˜1β=Jˆ1β−J1βγ˜1(w)=γˆ1(w)−γ1(w)=θˆTϕ(w)−θTϕ(w)−δ(w)=θ˜Tϕ(w)−δ(w)Using Eqs. (6) and (15), we obtain the following closed loop dynamics:(J0β+Jˆ1β)v+γ0(w)+γˆ1(w)−Ks=(J0β+J1β)α¨+γ0(w)+γ1(w)−τkβ−τdβJ0βv−J0βα¨+Jˆ1βv−J1βα¨+γˆ1(w)−γ1(w)+τkβ+τdβ−Ks=0−J0βs˙+J1βv−J1βα¨+J˜1βv+γ˜1(w)+τkβ+τdβ−Ks=0−J0βs˙−J1βs˙+J˜1βv+γ˜1(w)+τkβ+τdβ−Ks=0Jβs˙=J˜1βv+γ˜1β(w)+τkβ+τdβ−Ks=J˜1βv+θ˜Tϕ(w)−δ(w)+τkβ+τdβ−KsLet's consider the Lyapunov positive definite function:(16)L=12Jβs2+12ρJ∼1β2+12μθ∼Tθ∼Taking its time derivative yields:L˙=sJβs˙+1ρJ˜1βJ˜˙1β+1μθ˜Tθ˜˙L˙=s(J˜1βv+θ˜Tϕ(w)−δ(w)+τdβ+τkβ−Ks)+1ρJ˜1βJ˜˙1β+1μθ˜Tθ˜˙=L˙1+L˙2+L˙3L˙1=−Ks2−sδ(w)+sτkβ+sτdβL˙2=sJ˜1βv+1ρJ˜1βJ˜˙1βL˙3=sθ˜Tϕ(w)+1μθ˜Tθ˜˙If the following adaptation laws are considered:(17)J˜˙1β=Jˆ˙1β=−ρsvθ˜˙=θˆ˙=−μsϕ(w)we can write:L˙2=L˙3=0L˙=L˙1=−Ks2−sδ(w)+sτkβ+sτdβThe proposed control scheme is give in Fig. 10.For the stability study, we have to consider the different situations given in Fig. 11. In cases (A) and (C) and for the same effect, the human resistive torques cannot be equal. The human effort must be more important in the first case than in the second one. One can do the same analyze concerning the case of assistive effort. To have the same effect, the human effort in the case (B) must be more important than in the case (C). As a conclusion, the importance of the human effort depends on the position of the shank-orthosis and also on the direction of the motion.As the application selected consists of driving an actuated exoskeleton worn by a human subject, the stability study of the proposed controller must be as specific and complete as possible. For this, two cases have to be considered to accomplish the stability study of the system in closed loop.Case 1: Neural approximation errors and muscular effort are close to zero.τkβ=0,τdβ=0,δ=0The human wearing the orthosis is completely passive and must not produce torque in harmony of the orthosis torque and in its opposite. For this, the displacement of the shank is entirely ensured by the orthosis. The derivative of the Lyapunov function is then:L˙=L˙1=−Ks2≤0Invoking Barbalat's Lemma, we can say that s goes to zero becauseL¨is checked definite negative. Hence considering the adaptation laws of the unknown parameters (17),θ˜andJ˜1βare bounded. The controller (15) ensures the free moving orthosis is asymptotically stable (α→αdandα˙→α˙d).Case 2: Neural approximation error, muscular effort and external disturbances are different from zero.τkβ≠0,τdβ≠0,δ≠0The derivative of the Lyapunov function is then:L˙=L˙1=−Ks2−sδ(w)+sτkβ+sτdβWe can write:L˙≤−Ks2+|s||τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|ForL˙to be negative or zero:Ks2≥|s||τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|s2≥|s||τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|K|s|≥|τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|KIn this case, overall stability and convergence is ensured towards a bounded region of radius|s||τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|Kbecauseδ(w)and τkβ, τdβare bounded. Every time s tries to get out of this region,L˙becomes negative and the controller draws it immediately back in. Consequently and under the hypothesis thatα,α˙,αd,α˙dare bounded, the errors e ande˙are bounded. In the other hand and after a finite time of adaptation δ(w)becomes negligible and if we chooseK≫|τkβ+τdβ−δ(w)|we can get the convergence of e ande˙towards zero. The goal of the adaptation laws related to J1βand γ1 is to ensure a goad trajectory tracking both in position and in velocity. This means that their objective is not to construct the real values of J1βand γ1.The proposed controller has been evaluated on a real exoskeleton worn by a healthy subject in order to validate the aforementioned theoretical performances. The following section provides the obtained experimental results with a complete analysis and comments. The usual situations of any wearer have been also taken into account in the conducted experiments.The rigorous theoretical study conducted in the previous sections must now be confirmed and validated by experimental results. The identified dynamics allows us to considerably reduce the adaptation period. Another characteristic of the proposed controller is to reject undesirable behaviors of the exoskeleton. These points studied in the previous sections are implemented gradually. Firstly, the used exoskeleton is tested alone then on an appropriate dummy and finally on a healthy subject. This has the objective to exclude any risk for the voluntary human subjects. The used environment for the conducted experiments is given in Fig. 12. Indeed, we have considered a PC equipped with a dSpace DS1103 PPC real-time controller card, using Matlab/Simulink and dSpace Control Desk software. The sampling time has been fixed to 0.001s. Incremental encoder measures the real position and as the velocity is obtained by a simple derivative of the position, a low pass first order filter is used to reduce measurement noise.Our experimentations are realized using an orthosis worn by a healthy subject weighing 73kg, measuring 1m78 and having 41 years old. To perform flexion/extension movements, the subject has been in sitting position. The used desired trajectories are of sinusoidal form and have been chosen in the same way as those practiced by the doctor for rehabilitation reasons. The variation interval for the joint position is [0.2rad, 1.4rad] and for the joint velocity is [−0.6rad/s, 0.6rad/s]. To determine the standard deviationsσα,σα˙, we use:σα=ϖα10Δασα˙=ϖα˙10Δα˙where ϖα= is the number of Gaussian functions in position direction (here ϖα=7) andϖα˙=is the number of Gaussian functions in speed direction (hereϖα˙=7).The chosen control parameters and the other parameters of the RBFNN are given in Table (1). For the parameters, which concern RBFNN, they have been chosen so that the workspace (both in position and velocity) is covered by the use of a sufficient number of Gaussian functions. For the other parameters, the unique condition is that they should be strictly positive and they are chosen heuristically. In our case, several tests were conducted in simulations and the gains values, which have given the best results, were selected for experimentations.In position direction, the center of the first Gaussian function is located at 0.2, the center of the ith Gaussian function is located at i×0.2 and the center of the last Gaussian function is located at 1.4=7×0.2. In velocity direction, the center of the first Gaussian function is located at −0.6, the center of the ith Gaussian function is located at −0.6+(i−1)×0.2 and the center of the last Gaussian function is located at 0.6=−0.6+(7−1)×0.2.The position tracking is given in Fig. 13. Before instant 10s, the wearer remains completely passive and he do not apply any muscular effort. After, the wearer applies a resistive torque between instants 10s and 30s. Besides after a rest period between 30s and 40s, the subject try to apply an assistive effort between 40s and 55s.As we can see on Figs. 13 and 14, the tracking remains good whatever the attitude of the wearer (passive or active). We can also notice that if the resistive effort is very important makes the actuator in its maximal capacity, the system remains stable and maintains good performances in terms of trajectory tracking. The trajectory tracking in velocity is shown in Fig. 15and its tracking error in Fig. 16. As in position, the quality of tracking is good even if the wearer applies resistive or assistive efforts. When the resistive effort is important, the tracking error although it remains low, is greater than the tracking error in position. For the two other cases, performances remain good. In the other hand, if the wearer tries to apply an assistive effort randomly, the controller may consider it as a resistive one. In all cases, the controller is supposed to produce a good performance whatever the posture adopted by the wearer of the actuated orthosis.In Fig. 17, the applied control input and the RBFNN output are presented. The shape of the control input shows that the actuator is not highly sought and consequently its energy remains optimal. It can be easily noticed that both control input and RBFNN output react to the different situations of the wearer. The behavior of these signals is adequate with the good performances obtained in terms of trajectory tracking. For instance, they increase to counter the resistive human torque. In the opposite, they decrease in the case of human assistive effort. This clearly shows the importance of this type of controller that can handle different situations related to external disturbances and parametric uncertainties.Fig. 18gives the behavior of the inertia term in different cases: passive, resistive and assistive. It can be noticed that the inertia increases more when a resistive muscular effort is applied. More generally, changes in the inertial term are related to the activity of the wearer.In order to check the robustness of the proposed controller, we have applied it on another wearer (1m69, 71kg, 40years). All the parameters at the end of the first experimentation have been used without any changes. As shown in Figs. 19 and 20, we have a good quality of trajectory tracking both in position and in velocity. No muscular effort applied by the wearer is noticed on these figures. With this additional result, one can argue that our adaptive approach can easily be applied to rehabilitation problems when the initialization step is done on a mannequin. On other hand, a PD controller can be used alone on a negligible period to permit the adaptation of the neural parameters before integration of the neural network in the control loop.Furthermore, a Proportional Derivative (PD) controller (u=−Ks), has been applied to show the importance of using a specific controller as the proposed one. The tracking results of this controller are shown in Fig. 21and one can notice that this kind of controller is not efficient for wearable robots.RMS (Root Mean Square) tracking errors both in position and in velocity are given in Fig. 22. It can be easily noticed the proposed RBFNN controller has strongly improved the quality of trajectory tracking. The PD RMS depicted in this figure represent the average of two RMS resulting of the use of the first and the second healthy subjects considered for the RBFNN adaptive controller.
