@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Assuming that the proportion defective in a production process p is variable and the component lifetimes are Weibull distributed, integer nonlinear programming problems are formulated and solved in order to determine the optimum component inspection scheme by attributes for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration using available prior knowledge. A limited beta prior model is adopted to reflect the random fluctuations on p. The required quantity of components to test and the permissible number of component failures up to a specified censoring time are found by solving a minimisation problem with nonlinear constraints which are related to the tolerable average producer and consumer risks. First-order Taylor polynomials of the operating characteristic function are used to derive a quite accurate approximate solution. Lower and upper bounds are also deduced. Optimal solutions are usually robust to small variations in the Weibull parameters and prior information. Existing technical knowledge and experience are shown to be of great practical value in designing optimal sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes. The proposed approach generalises the classical viewpoint to those cases in which appreciable prior information on the fraction of defective systems exists, and also allows the analyst to determine the acceptability of a k-out-of-n:F system before assembly and to limit the range of p. Moreover, the practitioners may attain substantial savings in sample size and improved assessments of the true producer and consumer risks. A 4-out-of-5:F system of independent water pumps for cooling a reactor is considered to illustrate the suggested component test plans.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The design of sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes plays a fundamental role in industrial quality control and reliability analysis. Traditionally, a submitted lot of material is accepted or rejected on the basis of the experimental information provided by a random sample of test units. Acceptance inspection schemes usually specify the optimum sample size, test statistic and decision rule. In most cases, a constrained optimisation problem must be solved in order to determine the best sampling scheme. Acceptance test plans covering a wide range of situations are available in the scientific literature. Some recent references include Chen, Li, and Lam (2007), Fernández (2005, 2008, 2011), Arizono, Kawamura, and Takemoto (2008), Seo, Jung, and Kim (2009), Fernández and Pérez-González (2012a) and Wu, Aslam, and Jun (2012).A common approach in practice to improve the reliability of a system is to introduce component redundancy. Many complex systems have a k-out-of-n:F configuration, i.e. the system failure occurs as soon as k of its n redundant components fail. The so-called k-out-of-n:F systems occupy a prominent position in applied engineering due to their simplicity, economic advantage, and high reliability. The k-out-of-n:F structure and various generalisations have been widely discussed in recent decades. Papers by Yamamoto, Akiba, Nagatsuka, and Moriyama (2008), Fernández (2010a, 2014a), Wang, Li, Huang, and Chang (2012), Xiang and Levitin (2012), Levitin, Xing, and Dai (2014), Wells (2014) and Xie, Liao, and Jin (2014) are just a sample.System-based component testing is quite common in practice because it offers significant advantages in terms of time, effort and cost. System-level tests are frequently more complex, expensive and time-consuming. System reliability demonstration using component test data has been extensively studied in the literature, starting with the original paper by Gal (1974), and followed by the work of Mazumdar (1977, 1980), Yan and Mazumdar (1986, 1987), Easterling, Mazumdar, Spencer, and Diegert (1991), Rajgopal and Mazumdar (1988, 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 1997), Altınel and Özekici (1998), Rajgopal, Mazumdar, and Majety (1999), Altınel, Özekici, and Feyzioglu (2001) and Feyzioglu, Altınel, and Özekici (2008). Previous research generally assumes series or parallel systems with exponential component failures times, testing with replacement, and classical/frequentist risks to derive minimum-cost test plans. Recently, Bayramoglu (2013) studied the reliability of k-out-of-n complex system with two components per element. This paper considers k-out-of-n:F Weibull systems, testing without replacement, and average producer and consumer risks with a limited beta prior on the fraction nonconforming, and presents a computational procedure to determine the optimal sample size and decision criterium based on the number of component failures up to a given censoring time.Reliability test plans for Weibull distributions are routinely carried out in industry; see the recent papers by Chen et al. (2007), Arizono et al. (2008), Seo et al. (2009), Fernández, Pérez-González, Aslam, and Jun (2011), Fernández and Pérez-González (2012b) and Pérez-González and Fernández (2013), and references therein. In our case, the design of the acceptance plan is stated as a constrained optimisation problem which minimises the required sample size while ensuring that specified maximum average producer and consumer risks on system reliability are not exceeded. Integer nonlinear programming problems are solved to find optimal sample sizes and decision criteria. The suggested approach constitutes a well-founded alternative to classical perspectives because it requires less sample data to achieve the same protection to producers and consumers than methods based only on sampling theory. Our viewpoint is extremely advantageous when considering the expenses associated with testing procedures. It is well-known that the use of substantial prior information can significantly increase the quality of the inferential methods; see, e.g., Fernández (2006b, 2010c, 2012, 2014b), Aktekin and Caglar (2013), Aktekin (2014), Ausín, Galeano, and Ghosh (2014) and Ensthaler and Giebe (2014).The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides the reliability function of a k-out-of-n:F system with Weibull distributed component lifetimes. Section 3 presents attributes component test plans to demonstrate whether system reliability has met the required level. The corresponding operating characteristic function is deduced in Section 4. A limited beta distribution on the true proportion nonconforming, as well as average risks and operating characteristic functions, is used in Section 5 to incorporate available prior knowledge on the manufacturing process. Section 6 deals with the design of optimal time-censored component test plans for k-out-of-n:F Weibull systems using prior information. The underlying integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated. An approximate global solution and a procedure for solving the minimisation problem are proposed. Lower and upper bounds on the optimal sample size and acceptance number are also derived. A system of water pumps for cooling a reactor is considered in Section 7 for illustrative purposes. The paper then offers a brief discussion and some conclusions in Section 8.Consider that T represents the lifetime of a k-out-of-n:F system made up of n independent WeibullWs,θdistributed components, and also that X denotes the time-to-failure of a component. The probability density function (pdf) ofX∼Ws,θis then defined by(1)f(x)=sθ-sxs-1expx/θs,x>0,which implies that its cumulative distribution function (cdf) is given by(2)Fx=PrX⩽x=1-exp-x/θs,x>0.The Weibull distribution is one of the most important parametric models for the life-length of materials and devices, and includes as a special case the exponential distribution, which has an important function in reliability engineering; e.g., Fernández (2004, 2006a, 2010b), Mercier (2007), Pérez-González and Fernández (2009) and Li and Lin (2013). The parameters>0controls the shape of the density whereas the scale parameterθ>0determines the spread. The Weibull density (1) is L-shaped when0<s<1; it reduces to an exponential density ifs=1; and fors>1, the density is unimodal and positively skewed. The Weibull distribution is extremely flexible in fitting lifetime data because it encompasses both increasings>1, constant(s=1)and decreasing(0<s<1)hazard rates. In most reliability applications, Weibull distributions with s included in the 1 to 3 range are appropriate. The shape parameter is customarily tied to the failure mechanism, i.e., s is assumed to be a known constant in many situations. In practice, this constant may be a widely accepted value for the problem under consideration or may come from previous or related data.Since T coincides with the kth order statistic from the n component failure times, the pdf of the system lifetime is defined by(3)g(t)=knkF(t)k-1f(t)1-F(t)k-nfort>0; see, e.g., David and Nagaraja (2003). From (1)–(3), it then follows thatg(t)=∑i=0k-1-1ik-1iknksts-1/θsexpn-k+1+it/θsfort>0. Therefore, the reliability of the k-out-of-n:F system at mission timet>0,S(t)=PrT⩾t=∫t∞gzdz,is given byS(t)=∑i=0k-1-1ik-1iknkn-k+1+iexpn-k+1+it/θs.Alternatively, sinceT⩾t>0if and only if at mostk-1components have failed before t, it turns out thatS(t)coincides withS(t)=∑i=0k-1niexpt/θs-1iexpnt/θs.Furthermore, in view of (3), the distribution ofexp-T/θsisBetan-k+1,k, which implies that(4)n-k+1expT/θs-1/k∼F2k,2n-k+1,whereF2k,2n-k+1denotes the Fisher-Snedecor F-distribution with2kand2n-k+1degrees of freedom. In general, ifY∼Betaa,b, the distribution ofa1/Y-1/bisF2b,2a. Hence, as the functionΨ(t)=n-k+1expt/θs-1/kis increasing fort>0, it is clear from (4) thatS(t)=PrΨT⩾Ψ(t)may also be expressed as(5)S(t)=PrF2k,2n-k+1⩾Ψ(t),t>0.Assume that a k-out-of-n:F system is deemed conforming if its life-length T is at least a given timev0; i.e.,v0is the minimum lifetime of a nondefective system. In addition, consider thatp=PrT<v0=1-S(v0)is the actual fraction defective. Roughly,S(v0)=1-pwould represent the proportion of satisfactory k-out-of-n:F systems in a large batch.In practice, the producer is often interested in testing whether the null hypothesisH0:p⩽p0is reasonable, wherep0∈0,1is referred to as the acceptable quality level, whereas the consumer commonly specifies some particular valuep1greater thanp0, which can be regarded as a clearly rejectable quality level, and considers the alternative hypothesisH1:p⩾p1. Naturally, it is assumed that0<p0<p1<0.5in the paper. WhenH0is accepted, the true proportion of nonconforming systems is at mostp0, and the system reliability at timev0,S(v0), has attained the prescribed level1-p0.Suppose that a random sample of N components drawn at random from a large lot or a production process is subjected to a time-censored life experiment for a fixed timet0, and assume that U denotes the number of component failures observed up to the censoring timet0. IfX1,…,XNdenote the component lifetimes andξi=IXi⩽t0,i=1,2,…,N, thenU=∑i=1Nξi. The distribution of U is approximately binomial with parameters N andFt0provided the lot size is sufficiently large, which implies thatPrU=j=NjFt0j1-Ft0N-jforj=0,1,…,N.The optimal decision procedure based on the test statistic U to demonstrate whether the actual system lifetime is at leastv0with a high probability1-p0will acceptH0whenever U is sufficiently small; say, if U is at most equal to the so-called acceptance number C. The lot of components is then acceptable for constructing k-out-of-n:F systems, and the analyst can affirm at a certain confidence levelinfp⩽p0PrU⩽C|pthat the system lifetime is at leastv0with probability1-p0. On the other hand, if more than C component failures are observed during timet0, the production lot would be rejected, and the analyst may guarantee at a specific confidence levelinfp⩾p1PrU>C|pthat the system lifetime is less thanv0with probabilityp1. Clearly, the time-censored component life test can be stopped as soon as U exceeds C. In such a case, the lot must be rejected.The attributes component test plan presented above is characterised by the number of components to test, N, and the maximum allowable number of component failures, C, where0⩽C<N. A component lot is then accepted whenever the number of failures by timet0, U, does not exceed C. The stochastic behaviour of the inspection scheme(N,C)is described by its operating characteristic (OC) curve, which plots lot acceptance probabilities for the corresponding quality levels. The OC function at the actual fraction defective p is then defined by the acceptance probabilityA(p)=PrU⩽C|p.As commented, the distribution ofU≡UN,t0is approximately binomial with parameters N andq=Ft0. Assuming thatt0=rv0, where r is referred to as the censoring factor, it then follows thatq=1-exp-v0/θsrs.According to (5), the fraction defectivep=1-Sv0is given byp=PrF2k,2n-k+1<n-k+1expv0/θs-1/k.Hence, q can be expressed asq=1-n-k+1rs{n-k+1+kF2k,2n-k+1;p}rs,whereF2k,2n-k+1;pdenotes the p-quantile of theF2k,2n-k+1distribution. Therefore, for any valuep∈0,1, the OC functionA(·)≡A·;N,C,rs,k,nis defined byA(p)=∑i=0CNi[{1+kF2k,2n-k+1;p/n-k+1}rs-1]i{1+kF2k,2n-k+1;p/n-k+1}-Nrs.Alternatively,A(p)is also equal toPrF2C+1,2N-C⩾N-CC+11+kF2k,2n-k+1;pn-k+1rs-1.If N is large and q is small, the distribution of U is approximately Poisson with mean Nq. In such a caseA(p)≃exp-Nq∑i=0CNqi/i!,which implies thatA(p)≃Prχ2C+22⩾2N-2Nn-k+1rs{n-k+1+kF2k,2n-k+1;p}rs,whereχ2C+22designates a chi-square distribution with2C+2degrees of freedom.A basic assumption in classical inspection by attributes is that the fraction nonconforming p is constant. In many production processes, however, all components do not have an equal chance of being defective. In other words, there is often no reason to assume that p is a fixed number. Expert judgment and historical evidence can be used to assess a prior distribution on p. In most cases, existing technical knowledge and experience will be of great practical value in designing optimal sampling plans for lot acceptance purposes.Since the beta distribution is the prevailing probability model to reflect the random fluctuations in the proportion defective and accurate information about lower and upper bounds on p is commonly available in reliability analysis, a limited betaLBa,b,c,ddistribution with shape parametersa,b>0and a reduced domainc,d⊂0,1is assumed to describe our initial stage of knowledge concerning the actual value of p, wherec<p0<p1<d.The density function ofp∼LBa,b,c,d, denoted byh(·)≡h·;a,b,c,d, is defined byh(p)=(p-c)a-1(d-p)b-1(d-c)a+b-1B(a,b),c<p<d,whereB(·,·)is the well-known Euler’s beta function. Ifc=0andd=1, the fraction defective follows the standardBeta(a,b)distribution.The prior mean and standard deviation of p are obtained to be(6)Ep=c+a(d-c)a+bandDp=ab/a+b+1a+b/(d-c),respectively, whereas the prior cdf of p, denoted byH(·)≡H·;a,b,c,d, can be expressed asH(p)=PrF2a,2b⩽b(p-c)a(d-p),c<p<d.Average risks will be used to incorporate the available prior knowledge on p. In our case, the average producer risk is the conditional probability of rejecting a conforming systemE1-Ap;N,C,rs,k,n|p⩽p0,and the average consumer risk is the conditional probability of accepting a defective systemEAp;N,C,rs,k,n|p⩾p1.The corresponding risks are then defined by1-∫cp0Ap;N,C,rs,k,nh(p)Hp0dpand∫p1dAp;N,C,rs,k,nh(p)1-Hp1dp.According to the above expressions, classical and average risks are approximately equal when c and d are close top0andp1, respectively. In this situation, the influence of prior knowledge on the optimal plan is insignificant. The risks coincide when the prior mass is concentrated on the two-point setp0,p1andPrp=pi>0fori=0,1. In such a case, the corresponding classical and average producer and consumer risks are defined by1-Ap0andAp1.Average OC functions are usually considered in our situation to combine sample and prior information in the characterisation of the random performance of an inspection scheme. The average producer OC functionA0(·)≡A0·;N,C,rs,k,n,his defined byA0v=EA(p)|p⩽vforc<v<d, i.e.,A0vis the average of the lot acceptance probabilityA(p)forp⩽v. Reciprocally, the average consumer OC functionA1(·)≡A1·;N,C,rs,k,n,his defined byA1v=EA(p)|p⩾vforc<v<d. In our case,A0v=∫cvAzhzHvdzandA1v=∫vdAzhz1-Hvdzforc<v<d. Note that average producer and consumer risks are given by1-A0p0andA1p1, respectively. Moreover,A0c+=Ac,A1d-=Adand bothA0d-andA1c+are equal to the expected lot acceptance probabilityEA(p).Sampling inspection schemes for lot acceptance purposes are typically planned to guarantee that the sampling risks are sufficiently low. In our situation, the average producer and consumer risks of a feasible acceptance planN,Care assumed to be at mostαandβ, respectively, whereα,β<0.5. Thus,αandβdenote the maximum allowable average producer and consumer risks. The optimal inspection scheme would be the acceptance sampling plan with the smallest sample size.Assuming thatp∼LBa,b,c,dwitha>0,b>0and0⩽c<p0<p1<d⩽1, the constrained optimisation problem to find the necessary number of components to test,N∗, and the maximum allowable number of failures,C∗, to accept the construction of k-out-of-n:F systems of components is an integer nonlinear programming problem, which can be formulated as follows(7)MinimiseNSubjectto∫cp0A(p;N,C,rs,k,n)(p-c)a-1(d-p)b-1(d-c)a+b-1B(a,b)Hp0dp⩾1-α,∫p1dA(p;N,C,rs,k,n)(p-c)a-1(d-p)b-1(d-c)a+b-1B(a,b)1-Hp1dp⩽β,N,C∈Z,0⩽C<N,whereZis the set of integers.The first and second constraints in (7) reduce to the traditional conditionsAp0;N,C,rs,k,n⩾1-αandAp1;N,C,rs,k,n⩽βin the classical setting, i.e., when prior knowledge is discarded. In general, our approach significantly decreases the required sample size. Hence, the use of relevant prior information on the fraction defective is particularly attractive when test components are expensive or scarce.For illustrative purposes, Table 1presents the optimal attributes acceptance sampling plans(N∗,C∗)for k-out-of-n:F systems withW(s,θ)-distributed component lifetimes when1⩽k⩽n⩽5, the Weibull shape parameter iss=1.5,2.5, the censoring factor isr=0.9,1.0,1.1, the acceptable and rejectable quality levels arep0=0.01andp1=0.20, the maximum allowable producer and consumer risks are given byα=0.05andβ=0.10, and the prior distribution of p isLB(a,b,c,d)withE[p]=D[p]=0.01,c=0.001andd=0.25. The corresponding best inspection schemes when the analyst disregards the available prior information on p are reported in Table 2.In view of Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that the optimal plan is quite robust to small changes in the Weibull shape parameter. In most cases, the minimum sample sizeN∗is non-increasing as a function of the censoring factor r, whereas the optimal acceptance numberC∗is insensitive to small changes in r. In addition, note thatN∗tends to reduce andC∗becomes larger when n is fixed and k increases. It can also be shown thatN∗andC∗are usually non-increasing inp1and non-decreasing inp0. Moreover, bothN∗andC∗often reduce as α or β increases.According to Tables 1 and 2, the incorporation of available prior knowledge on p provides appreciable savings in sample size. For example, ifs=2.5and the prior information is assumed, the best inspection schemes for a 4-out-of-5:F system are (23,6), (19,6) and (15,6) whenr=0.9,1.0and 1.1, respectively. If prior knowledge on p is discarded, i.e. adopting the frequentist perspective, the corresponding optimal plans would be (31,9), (25,9) and (19,8). The reduction in sample size due to the use of prior information is clearly significant.As a graphical illustration, Fig. 1displays the average producer and consumer OC functions,A0(·)andA1(·), associated to the optimal attributes sampling plan29,6for a 4-out-of-5:F system ofW(2.5,θ)-distributed components whenα=0.05,β=0.10,p0=0.01,p1=0.20,t0=40,v0=50andp∼LB(a,b,c,d)withE[p]=D[p]=0.01,c=0.001andd=0.25. Clearly,A0(·)andA1(·)are decreasing functions satisfying the constraintsA0p0⩾1-αandA1p1⩽β. Observe also that bothA0d-andA1c+coincide with the mean acceptance probabilityEA(p).In principle, it is worthwhile to find intervals which enclose the optimal sample size and acceptance number in order to efficiently solve the constrained optimisation problem (7). SinceA·is a decreasing function, it follows thatAp0<∫cp0A(p)h(p)Hp0dp<AcandAd<∫p1dA(p)h(p)1-Hp1dp<Ap1.As a consequence, it can be shown thatN∗⩽NUandC∗⩽CU, whereNU,CUis the solution of the optimisation problemminN:N,C∈Ωp0,p1in which the feasible regionΩp0,p1is the family of plansN,C∈Z×Zsuch that0⩽C<N,Ap0⩾1-αandAp1⩽β. Similarly, it is derived thatN∗⩾NLandC∗⩾CL, whereNL,CLis the optimal solution of the problemminN:N,C∈Ωc,d. Hence,NLandNUare lower and upper bounds on the optimal sample size, whereasCLandCUare lower and upper bounds on the optimal acceptance number. That is,N∗∈NL,NUandC∗∈CL,CU.Observe thatNU,CUis the optimal plan when the traditional frequentist approach is assumed, i.e., when the classical risks are used. Note also that, ifp0andp1are sufficiently close to c and d, respectively, thenN∗=NL=NUandC∗=CL=CU.First-order Taylor polynomials of the OC function can be used to determine an approximate solution of the minimisation program (7). In most practical cases,A(p)≈Au0+A′u0p-u0forc<p⩽p0, whereu0=Ep|p⩽p0andA′(·)denotes the derivative ofA(·). Similarly,A(p)≈Au1+A′u1p-u1forp1⩽p<d, whereu1=Ep|p⩾p1. In such cases, the average producer and consumer risks,E1-A(p)|p⩽p0andEA(p)|p⩾p1, are approximately equal to1-Au0andAu1, respectively. Therefore, the solutionNA,CAof the problemminN:N,C∈Ωu0,u1constitutes an approximately optimal acceptance sampling plan. Computation ofNA,CAdoes not need numerical integration, which is an important advantage.The conditional expectationsu0andu1are defined byu0=∫cp0ph(p)Hp0dpandu1=∫p1dph(p)1-Hp1dp.Assuming thatH1(·)≡H·;a+1,b,c,d, it turns out thatu0andu1can be expressed asu0=c+a(d-c)H1(p0)a+bH(p0)andu1=c+a(d-c)1-H1(p1)a+b1-H(p1).A step-by-step procedure to compute the optimal global solution(N∗,C∗)of the integer nonlinear programming problem (7) in order to determine the optimal acceptance sampling plan for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration when the prior distribution chosen by the producer and consumer is limited betaLBa,b,c,dwith given meanμ, varianceσ2and range(c,d)can be summarised as follows:•Step 1. Select the maximum tolerable producer and consumer risksαandβ, the acceptable and rejectable quality levelsp0andp1, and the censoring factor r, where0<α,β<0.5,0<p0<p1<1andr>0. Ifr≠1, then also select the value of the Weibull shape parameters>0.Step 2. Choose the prior truncation points c and d, where0⩽c<p0andp1<d⩽1.Step 3. Compute the optimal solutionNL,CLof the problemminN:N,C∈Ωc,d.Step 4. Select the prior mean μ and the prior varianceσ2, wherec<μ<dand0<σ2<μ-cd-μ.Step 5. Assuming thatp∼LBa,b,c,d, find the prior parameters a and b such thatEp=μandDp=σ. From (6), it follows that a and b are obtained to bea=μ-c2d-μσ2(d-c)-μ-cd-candb=μ-cd-μ2σ2(d-c)-d-μd-c.Step 6. Set the initial valuesN=NLandC=CL.Step 7. WhileEAp;N,C,rs,k,n|p⩾p1>β, replace N byN+1.Step 8. IfEAp;N,C,rs,k,n|p⩽p0<1-α, then replace C byC+1and N bymaxN,C+1, and go to Step 7. Otherwise, letN∗=NandC∗=C.Step 9. The optimal sample size and acceptance number are given byN∗andC∗, respectively.The above procedure finds the optimal solution in a finite number of steps. When determining the initial values of N and C, instead of using the lower boundsNLandCL, it is generally preferable to consider the quite accurate approximationsNAandCAto reduce the number of iterations. In most practical situations, the sampling planNA,CAis a nearly optimal inspection scheme which can greatly simplify the process of determining the best component test plan. In addition, since the OC curve is usually concave/convex for acceptable/rejectable quality levels, it follows from Jensen’s inequality thatNAandCAare often lower bounds onN∗andC∗, respectively. As will be shown later, the test planNA,CAcoincides with the optimal schemeN∗,C∗in many cases.A system of five water pumps for cooling a reactor was considered by Fernández (2010a). The water pumps are identical and act independently, and the failure of the system occurs as soon as four pumps fail, i.e., the system operates if at least two pumps function. Hence, the system has a k-out-of-n:F structure withk=4andn=5. Under specific extreme conditions, the failure time (in hours) of each pump is supposed to follow the WeibullWs,θdistribution withs=2.5, i.e.X∼W2.5,θ. In addition, the 4-out-of-5:F Weibull system is deemed conforming if its lifetime under the above conditions, T, exceedsv0=50hours.The prior knowledge on the fraction defectivep=PrT<v0is described by aLB(a,b,c,d)distribution with limitsc=0.001andd=0.25, meanμ=0.01and standard deviationσ=0.01. Hyperparameters a and b are then given bya=0.744578andb=19.8554. A reliability engineer assumes that the maximum tolerable producer and consumer risks areα=0.05andβ=0.10, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the corresponding acceptable and rejectable quality levels arep0=0.01andp1=0.20.Table 3presents the exact and approximate optimal water pump test plans,N∗,C∗andNA,CA, whenp∼LB(a,b,c,d), the acceptable quality level isp0=0.01,0.02,0.03, the rejectable quality level isp1=0.20, and the censoring timet0=rv0is40,50and 60hours. The corresponding censoring factorr=t0/v0is then given by 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2. The lower and upper bounds on the optimal sample size,NLandNU, and the acceptance number,CLandCU, are also included.According to Table 3, the best inspection schemesN∗,C∗are (29,6), (19,6) and (13,6) when the acceptable quality level isp0=0.01andt0is 40, 50 and 60hours, respectively. The corresponding approximate optimal plansNA,CAare (29,6), (18,6) and (13,6). The schemesNL,CLare (17,3), (11,3) and (8,3), whereas the plansNU,CUare (40,9), (25,9) and (18,9), respectively. Clearly, the schemeNA,CAprovides an excellent approximation to the optimal planN∗,C∗. In most practical situations, the approximate optimal sample size and acceptance number,NAandCA, are nearly exact.Fig. 2displays the optimal sample sizes versus the acceptable quality level when prior information is assumed or discarded and the rejectable quality level isp1=0.20. The decrease in sample size due to the inclusion of prior knowledge is considerable and becomes larger whenp0increases. Reciprocally, Fig. 3shows the optimal sample sizes versusp1when the acceptable quality level isp0=0.01. The reduction in sample size is also evident in this case, especially whenp1is small. In light of Figs. 2 and 3, it is evident that the required sample sizes are non-decreasing and non-increasing as functions ofp0andp1, respectively.When censoring timet0=40, the optimal plan is (40,9) if prior information is discarded. A random sample of 40 pumps must then be simultaneously tested for 40hours, and the lot of components would be accepted if and only if the number of observed failures is at most 9. In contrast, if prior information is incorporated, the optimal inspection schemeN∗,C∗is (29,6). In this case, the analyst needs a random sample of only 29 pumps, and the production lot would be accepted if no more than 6 failures are observed during 40hours. Fig. 1 displays the average producer and consumer OC functions for the sampling plan (29,6). Producer risks versus acceptable quality levels for the inspection scheme (29,6) when prior information is assumed or discarded are shown in Fig. 4. Similarly, Fig. 5shows the corresponding consumer risks versus rejectable quality levels. In view of Figs. 4 and 5, it is clear that the producer and consumer risks drop when prior information is taken into account. In this case, the conditional expectationsu0=Ep|p⩽p0andu1=Ep|p⩾p1are given byu0=0.00430488andu1=0.203412, which implies thatNA=29andCA=6. Consequently, the approximate optimal planNA,CAcoincides with the optimal schemeN∗,C∗. It is also observed in Table 3 that3⩽C∗⩽9and17⩽N∗⩽40if the analyst supposes thatp∈0.001,0.25with probability 1.The design of optimal decision rules for acceptance of complex systems based on component test plans is an extremely practical and essential part of industrial reliability and quality control. Component test plans are almost always faster, cheaper and less complicated than system-level tests. System-based component testing is highly desirable from the practitioner perspective because the entire system need not be previously assembled and allows the assembly of the system to be postponed until a given high reliability at a certain fixed mission time can be assured. In this way, the acceptability of a system may be determined prior to assembly.Essentially, the determination of the most efficient criterion for accepting or rejecting a lot of components can be formulated as an optimisation problem subject to several constraints often imposed by the producer and the consumer. A reliability sampling plan for lot acceptance purposes usually prescribes how many components must be placed on test, for how long and under what stress conditions (humidity, voltage, temperature, etc.), as well as for which values of the observed test statistic the submitted lot must be accepted.In industrial manufacturing, even when the production process is stable, there is normally no reason to assume that the fraction defective p is constant. The adoption of a prior distribution on p is often beneficial in sampling inspection. Given that prior evidence suggesting that p is quite low is fairly common, this paper assumed a limited beta distribution with a reduced parameter space(c,d)to describe the stochastic behaviour of p. This prior model allows the engineer the flexibility to include precise limits of p into the decision analysis.Assuming that the component lifetime distribution is Weibull, an integer nonlinear programming problem has been formulated and solved in the present paper in order to find the acceptance sampling plan with smallest sample size for k-out-of-n:F system reliability demonstration based on a time-censored component inspection scheme by attributes and prior information that entails sufficiently small average producer and consumer risks. Nearly exact approximations to the optimal sample size and acceptance number are also deduced. A submitted lot is accepted whenever the number of observed failures by a prespecified censoring timet0in a random sample ofN∗components does not exceed the acceptance numberC∗.In general, the incorporation of prior knowledge on p yields a more effective use of information provided by the production process, and therefore a more realistic assessment of the actual producer and consumer risks, as well as appreciable savings in sample size. The use of relevant prior information is therefore especially important when test components are expensive or scarce.The proposed attributes component test plans are quite insensitive to slight modifications in the Weibull parameters and the prior information, and are particularly advisable when it is economically inconvenient to test a whole system.The influence of the prior information on the optimal sampling plan is moderate when c and d are close top0andp1, respectively. However, if the prior mass is not highly concentrated on the intervalp0,p1, the sample size required for the optimal component test plan is significantly decreased. Our approach might also be viewed as a generalisation of the frequentist perspective to those situations in which prior knowledge is substantial.
