@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper extends possibilities for analyzing incomplete ordinal information about the parameters of an additive value function. Such information is modeled through preference statements which associate sets of alternatives or attributes with corresponding sets of rankings. These preference statements can be particularly helpful in developing a joint preference representation for a group of decision-makers who may find difficulties in agreeing on numerical parameter values. Because these statements can lead to a non-convex set of feasible parameters, a mixed integer linear formulation is developed to establish a linear model for the computation of decision recommendations. This makes it possible to complete incomplete ordinal information with other forms of incomplete information.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The exact specification of attribute weights and normalized scores of an additive multiattribute value function (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) can be challenging due to many reasons, such as urgency of the decision or lack of resources (e.g. Weber, 1987). A complete specification of parameters may not be needed, if less information would produce the same unequivocal decision recommendation or if the aim of the analysis is to discard inferior alternatives to establish a smaller set of good decision candidates. A complete specification can even be undesirable if the model seeks to capture multiple decision-makers’ (DMs’) preferences, for example. Indeed, several Preference Programming methods accommodate incomplete preference information through intervals of weight ratios or normalized scores which model alternatives’ attribute-specific values, for example. The methods thus allow the DMs to characterize their preferences with the degree of accuracy they are confident with. The resulting set of feasible parameters then contains the ones that correspond to the DM’s ‘true preferences’ (e.g., White et al., 1982, 1984; Salo and Hämäläinen, 1992).The assessment of multi-attribute alternatives usually requires subjective evaluations (Moshkovich et al., 2002). According to Larichev (1992), numerical evaluation can even affect negatively the reliability of the analysis. Indeed, Moshkovich et al. (2002) argue that ordinal statements – as ordinal comparisons of actual or hypothetical alternatives – tend to be more reliable, less time-consuming and better understood by the DMs. Thus, they are widely used in the elicitation of normalized scores and attribute weights. One benefit of ordinal information is that it does not necessitate a quantitative measurement scale; for example, stakeholders’ disagreements about appropriate quantitative measures can be resolved by using ordinal information, as in the application by Grushka-Cockayne et al. (2008). There are several methods which first elicit a rank-ordering for the attribute weights or apply Likert-type scales or rank-orderings to classify alternatives, and then convert these ordinal statements into numerical point estimates (see Barron and Barrett, 1996; Sarabando and Dias, 2010). The decision recommendations provided by such conversions can, however, be sensitive to the selected numerical point estimates.The Preference Programming methods avoid these conversions by modeling pairwise comparisons between attribute weights (e.g., Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986) and normalized scores (Salo and Hämäläinen, 2001) as constraints on the model parameters (for recent applications, see Kangaspunta et al., 2012; Liesiö and Salo, 2012). Most of these methods assume that the DM provides either a full rank-ordering of the alternatives or the attributes, or that she makes several individual separate pairwise comparisons among them. In the RICH method (Salo and Punkka, 2005), the relative importance of the attributes is modeled with incomplete ordinal information. The DM can, for example, state that attributes cost and environmental aspects are among the three most important ones. The method, however, does not capture other forms of preference statements about the relative importance of attributes and the alternatives’ attribute-specific values can be evaluated only through score intervals.The Preference Programming model developed in this paper captures incomplete ordinal information about both the alternatives and the attribute weights. Such information is elicited through statements which associate a set of alternatives or attributes with a set of rankings. For example, the DM can specify three alternatives of which one has the ranking one (i.e., it is the most preferred) with regard to attribute environmental aspects; or she can specify the two most important attributes; or state that a given alternative is among the three least preferred ones. Such preference statements can be particularly helpful in modeling a joint preference representation for a group of DMs who cannot agree on exact numerical parameter values. For example, if each group member is asked to specify the most preferred alternative with regard to environmental aspects, the group’s preferences can be expressed by a statement that the most preferred alternative is among the ones that are specified by the group members. Similarly, for example the group’s statement concerning an alternative’s ranking can be formed by taking the union of its members’ opinions. The form of the incomplete ordinal statements is flexible in that the statements can be given with regard to any subset of attributes and within any set of alternatives (or attributes). Taken together, incomplete ordinal information can be used, for example, to classify attributes or alternatives without assigning exact numerical values to these classes.Mathematically, the set of weights and normalized scores that are consistent with incomplete ordinal statements can be non-convex, as shown by Salo and Punkka (2005) in the context of attribute weights. In this paper, the computational challenges caused by this non-convexity are resolved by employing binary variables to retain the linearity of the model. The decision recommendations can therefore be computed efficiently; in addition, it is possible to introduce even other forms of incomplete information about the alternatives’ normalized scores and the attribute weights. This possibility to incorporate both ordinal and numerical information in the same model improves possibilities for capturing the DM’s preferences. For example, it makes it possible to exclude extreme realizations of model parameters so that the preference information model better matches the DM’s true intensions, as noted by Sage and White (1984). Indeed, if only ordinal information about the alternatives is used, these extreme parameters can rule out dominance relations between alternatives.The possibility to use both incomplete ordinal and numerical preference statements can be particularly helpful in problems which involve attributes without a natural measurement scale and are therefore difficult to evaluate numerically, or in ‘large’ problems in which the first phase of the decision support process is to screen the initial set of alternatives. In such cases, even a statement like “these 2 alternatives are among the 5 best ones” may help discard many alternatives through dominance relations so that not all alternatives need to be considered, thus leaving fewer alternatives for more detailed evaluation.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses Preference Programming methods. Section 3 formalizes incomplete ordinal information and constructs the corresponding mixed integer linear formulation. Section 4 considers uses of incomplete ordinal information in decision support. An example is presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.The difficulties of specifying the parameters of an additive value function∑wjvj(xj)have led to the development of elicitation approaches that accommodate incomplete information about the attribute weights or the alternatives’ attribute-specific normalized scores. In these approaches, incomplete information is often modeled through set inclusion, whereby the DM’s preferences are captured through preference statements which impose constraints on the model parameters. These statements – such as intervals of normalized scores, attribute weights and attribute weight ratios (e.g., Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Salo and Hämäläinen, 1992, 2001) and ordinal statements (e.g., White et al., 1984; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986; Pearman, 1993) – lead to linear constraints on the normalized scores and attribute weights (for reviews, see Weber, 1987; Salo and Hämäläinen, 2010).In Preference Programming, the (pairwise) dominance relation is used for the comparison of alternatives. Specifically, alternative xidominates xkif its value is higher than or equal to that of xkfor all feasible parameters and strictly higher for some feasible parameters (e.g., White et al., 1982; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986). A dominated alternative should not be selected, because the alternative that dominates it yields a higher or equal value for all feasible parameters. A rational DM is thus interested in non-dominated alternatives. The set of non-dominated alternatives can become smaller, if the model parameters are further constrained (White et al., 1982). Many early methods provide tailored algorithms which examine the relevant extreme points of the feasible region to resolve dominance relations (e.g., White et al., 1982; Kirkwood and Sarin, 1985; Hazen, 1986). More generally, the non-dominated alternatives can be computed through linear programming.Ordinal information consists of comparisons in which numbers are not used to describe strength of the preference. Kirkwood and Sarin (1985) present dominance conditions when strict or weak ordinal statements about the relative importance of the attributes are given. Pearman (1993) extends this work by presenting a computational model which uses an ordered metric that rank-orders attribute weight differences, too. Park et al. (1996) extend this approach by applying the ordered metric for normalized scores.Hazen (1986) establishes a mathematical relation between the non-dominated and the potentially optimal alternatives which have the greatest overall value with some feasible parameters. He also shows how the consistency of preference statements, dominance relations between alternatives, and potentially optimal alternatives can be solved when the preferences are expressed through strict ordinal comparisons of hypothetical alternatives.The RICH method (Salo and Punkka, 2005) introduces the notion of incomplete ordinal information to the elicitation of attribute weights. This information is elicited through statements, which associate a set of rankings with a set of attributes. These sets do not have to be equal in size; statements like “the two attributes a1 and a2 are among the three most important ones” or “either a1 or a2 is the most important among the three attributes” can be captured. Incomplete ordinal information has been applied for attribute weight elicitation in several applications (e.g., Ojanen et al., 2005; Salo and Liesiö, 2006; Liesiö et al., 2007; Mild and Salo, 2009).Because the feasible region for the attribute weights may be non-convex, the computation of decision recommendations in RICH is based on extreme point enumeration. This approach has limitations in that only ordinal information can be used to characterize the attribute weights while the alternatives’ normalized scores can only be modeled as intervals or point estimates.In the next section, the use of incomplete ordinal information is extended by developing a model for the evaluation of both attributes and alternatives. This model eliminates the above limitations and can therefore be used in conjunction with any other forms of incomplete information that correspond to linear inequalities on the model parameters.There are m alternatives X∗={x1,…,xm} which are evaluated with regard to n attributes A={a1,…,an}. Each alternative xi∈X∗ is described by a vector of achievement levelsx1i,…,xni. If the DM’s preferences fulfill certain conditions, such as mutual preference independence and difference independence (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976; Dyer and Sarin, 1979), the alternatives’ overall values can be modeled with a measurable additive value function(1)V(xi)=∑j=1nvjxji,in whichvj(xji)is the value of alternative xiwith regard to attribute aj(i.e., score).It is customary to choose the most and least preferred achievement levelsxj∗andxj∘, respectively, for each attribute ajso that the attribute-specific values (i.e., scores) of the alternatives in X∗ fulfillvj(xj∘)⩽vj(xji)⩽vj(xj∗)in which at least the other of the inequalities is strict. We follow the usual convention and normalize the value function so thatvj(xj∘)=0,j=1,…,nandV(x∗)=∑j=1nvj(xj∗)=1.After this normalization, the overall value (1) can be expressed(2)V(xi)=∑j=1nvjxji=∑j=1nvjxj∗-vjxj∘vjxjivjxj∗-vjxj∘=∑j=1nwjvjNxji,in which the value differencewj=vj(xj∗)-vj(xj∘)=vj(xj∗)is the attribute weight of ajandvjN(xji)=vj(xji)/vj(xj∗)∈[0,1]is the normalized score of xiwith regard to this attribute. The multiplication of these two terms in (2), however, leads to non-linearities and consequently poses computational challenges when analyzing incomplete preference information about the weights and normalized scores. The following formulations are therefore based on representation (1), in the recognition that attribute weights and normalized scores are consistent with this representation through (2). For notational purposes, the set X∗ includes all hypothetical alternatives that are employed in preference elicitation. Specifically, X∗⊃{x1∗,…,xn∗} for whichxji∗=xj∗, if i=j andxji∗=0otherwise, because the overall values of these alternatives are equal to the attribute weights:V(xj∗)=vj(xjj∗)+∑l≠jvl(xlj∗)=vj(xj∗)=wj. The scoressij=vj(xji)are recorded in the matrixs=s11⋯s1n⋮⋱⋮sm1⋯smn=v1x11⋯vnxn1⋮⋱⋮v1x1m⋯vnxnm.The above normalization conditions are satisfied by scores that belong to the setS0=s∈Rm×n|0⩽sij⩽wj,i=1,…,m,j=1,…,n,∑j=1nsj∗j=1,in whichwj=vj(xj∗)=sj∗j.In Preference Programming, incomplete information leads to constraints on feasible scores. For example the statement “the normalized score of x1 with regard to attribute a1 is between 0.5 and 0.6” would lead to the constraint0.5s1∗1⩽s11⩽0.6s1∗1. Even hypothetical alternatives can be utilized in preference statements: “overall, a hypothetical alternative x3 with normalized scoresvN(xj3)∈[0.5,0.6]for all j=1,…, n is at least as preferred as x2, but not preferred to x1” leads to constraints∑j=1ns2j⩽∑j=1ns3j⩽∑j=1ns1jand0.5sj∗j⩽s3j⩽0.6sj∗j∀j=1,…,n. The statement “the weight of attribute a2 is not higher than the weight of attribute a1” can be modeled with the constraintV(x2∗)=s2∗2=w2⩽w1=s1∗1=V(x1∗). Such statements reduce the set of feasible scores to S⊂S0.Generally, the alternatives’ overall values are different for different feasible scores in S. The concept of dominance compares the overall values of two alternatives with all feasible scores (e.g., White et al., 1982):Definition 1Let xi, xk∈X∗ and ∅≠S⊆S0. Alternative xidominates xkif and only if V(xi)⩾V(xk) ∀s∈S and ∃s′∈S such that V(xi)>V(xk).By definition, the alternatives in X⊆X∗ that are not dominated by any alternative in X are non-dominated alternatives (among X). It is not advisable to choose a dominated alternative, because the values of those alternatives that dominate it are at least as high for all feasible scores. If xidominates xkwith feasible scores S, then xidominates xkalso with feasible scores S′⊂S, unless their overall values are equal throughout S′. Thus, as a rule, dominated alternatives will remain dominated, even if further preference information is obtained (White et al., 1982). Dominance relations can be checked by linear programming. If the minimum of[V(xi)-V(xk)]=∑j=1n[sij-skj]over S is negative, then xidoes not dominate xk. If it is positive, then xidominates xk. If it is zero, computing the maximum of [V(xi)−V(xk)] over S reveals whether there also exists a feasible score such that V(xi)>V(xk).The DM need not define all the alternatives that are used in preference elicitation or compared at the outset of the analysis. Introduction of a new alternative xh, for which the normalization conditionsvj(xj∘)⩽vj(xjh)⩽vj(xj∗)hold, introduces new score variables shj, j=1,…, n, but does not constrain the other scores sij, i≠h. Thereby also all dominance relations between pairs of alternatives in X∌xhremain unchanged if xhis added to X∗. Preference statements that involve xhcan then result in new dominance relations also between the alternatives in X.Because the set X∗ includes alternatives whose overall values are equal to the attribute weights, all the results on capturing statements about the alternatives’ values in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 can also be applied to the elicitation of attribute weights.Complete ordinal information of alternatives X is a full rank-ordering that associates a unique ranking with each alternative xi∈X. Formally, if X⊆X∗ is a non-empty set of alternatives, a rank-ordering is a bijectionr:X↦{j∈Z|1⩽j⩽|X|}(Salo and Punkka, 2005; throughout the paper ∣B∣ denotes the number of elements in the set B). Rank-orderings are denoted by the convention r(X)=(r1,…, r∣X∣) in which rk=r(xl; X) is the ranking of the alternative with the kth smallest index in X (i.e., ∣{xi∈X∣i<l}∣=k−1). We use rank-orderings such that if the ranking of alternative xkis smaller than that of xi, then xkis either strictly preferred to xior they are equally preferred. For example, if X={x1,x4,x5}, then the rank-ordering r(X)=(1,3,2) corresponds to rankings r(x1; X)=1, r(x4; X)=3 and r(x5; X)=2, meaning that x1 is the most preferred alternative of the three (or, more specifically, no other alternative is preferred to x1), followed by x5 and then x4. The rank-orderings can be defined with regard to any non-empty attribute set A′⊆A.Incomplete ordinal information refers to ordinal statements which associate a set of alternatives (denoted by I) with a set of rankings (J) (cf. attribute weight elicitation proposed by Salo and Punkka, 2005). For example, if I={x1} and J={1}, then the ranking of alternative x1 is one. Thus one such a statement does not specify unique rankings for all alternatives if there are more than two alternatives.Definition 2(I,J,X,A′) is an incomplete ordinal statement (IOS), if ∅≠A′⊆A, ∅≠I⊆X⊆X∗, and∅≠J⊆{j∈Z|1⩽j⩽|X|}.In Definition 2, the set X includes the alternatives under comparison and A′ is the set of attributes with regard to which this comparison is made. Whenever there is no risk of confusion, references to these sets are omitted by adopting the notational conventions r(X)=r and (I,J)=(I,J,X,A′).Definition 2 does not assume that sets I and J have equally many elements. Indeed, if the number of alternatives in I is equal to or less than the number of rankings in J (that is, ∣I∣⩽∣J∣), then the ranking of each alternative in I is in J. For example, the statement that x1 is either the best or the second best one of {x1,x2,x3} with regard to attribute a4 is captured by the IOS (I,J,X,A′)=({x1},{1,2},{x1,x2,x3},{a4}). This statement is compatible with four rank-orderings r=(r(x1; X),r(x2; X),r(x3; X)), that is, (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3) and (2,3,1).On the other hand, if ∣I∣>∣J∣, it is assumed that the rankings in J are attained by alternatives that are in I. For example, stating that some two alternatives among x1,x4 and x7 are overall the two most preferred alternatives in the set X={x1,…,x10} can be modeled as (I,J,X,A′)=({x1,x4,x7},{1,2},{x1,…,x10},A).The rank-orderings that are compatible with an IOS (I,J,X,A′) are denoted by R(I,J,X,A′) (or R(I,J) for short) and defined as follows (Salo and Punkka, 2005).Definition 3Let (I,J,X,A′) be an IOS. The set of compatible rank-orderings is(3)R(I,J)={r(X)∈R(X)|∀j∈J∃xk∈Is.t.r(xk;X)=j},if|I|⩾|J|{r(X)∈R(X)|r(xk;X)∈J∀xk∈I},if|I|<|J|,in which R(X) is the set of all rank-orderings defined on X.Statements about the alternatives’ rankings constrain the feasible scores. Letv(xi,A′)=v(xi)=∑{j|aj∈A′}vj(xji)denote the value of alternative xiwith regard to attributes A′. The alternative with ranking 1 cannot have a lower value than the alternative with ranking 2, and so on: r(xi)<r(xk)⇒v(xi)⩾v(xk). In other words, the ranking r(xi) implies that there are r(xi)−1 alternatives in X whose value is not strictly smaller and ∣X∣−r(xi) alternatives, whose value is not strictly higher than that of xi.The scores that are consistent with a single rank-ordering r(X) are(4)S(r(X))={s∈S0|v(xi)⩾v(xj)ifr(xi;X)<r(xj;X),xi,xj∈X},and the scores that fulfill statement (I,J,X,A′) are(5)S(I,J)=⋃r∈R(I,J)S(r(X)).The set S(I,J) is not necessarily convex (Salo and Punkka, 2005) and consequently cannot be modeled through linear constraints on scores. We therefore develop a characterization of S(I,J) that employs binary variables yj(xi) to constrain compatible rank-orderings R(I,J) such that yj(xi)=1⇒r(xi)⩽j and yj(xi)=0⇒r(xi)>j for any r∈R(I,J). Binary variables yj(xi) are defined for all xi∈X, but the indices j∈{1,…,∣X∣−1} that are employed depend on the statement.First, assume that J consists of consecutive rankings:J={j|j̲⩽j⩽j¯},j̲⩽j¯. If ∣I∣<∣J∣, the ranking of each alternative xi∈I is in J. Because J consists of consecutive rankings, this implies that the ranking of any xi∈I is at mostj¯, but not smaller thanj. With the above interpretation of the binary variables, this can be captured with constraintsyj¯(xi)=1and yj−1(xi)=0, which can be writtenyj¯(xi)-yj̲-1(xi)=1∀xi∈I. For example, if I={x1}, and J={2,3}, then the ranking of x1 is two or three. That is, it is at most three (y3(x1)=1), but not smaller than two (y1(x1)=0).If ∣I∣⩾∣J∣, according to Definition 3 each ranking in J is attained by an alternative in I. Therefore, alternatives that are not in I have rankings that are either smaller thanjor greater thanj¯. Thus, if the ranking ofxi∈I¯={xi∈X|xi∉I}is at mostj¯(i.e.,yj¯(xi)=1), it must also be smaller thanj(i.e., yj−1(xi)=1). If, on the contrary, the ranking ofxi∈I¯is higher thanj¯(i.e,yj¯(xi)=0), then it is also bigger thanj(i.e., yj−1(xi)=0). Constraintsyj¯(xi)=yj̲-1(xi)∀xi∈I¯capture this inference. For example, the statement (I,J)=({x1,x2},{2}) imposes the requirement that the ranking of xi,i∉{1,2}, is not 2. If it is at most 2 (i.e., y2(xi)=1), then it must also be smaller than 2 (i.e., y1(xi)=1); but if it is higher than 2 (i.e., y2(xi)=0), then it cannot simultaneously be smaller than 2 (i.e., y1(xi)=0). Ranking 2 is then attained by x1 or x2, because r is a bijection. Fig. 1illustrates the above inference.To model the scores S(I,J), we introduce a real-valued milestone variable zjto distinguish between the values of alternatives with rankings j and j+1. In view of (4) and (5) and the above interpretation of the binary variables, if yj(xi)=1, then v(xi)⩾zj; and if yj(xi)=0, then v(xi)⩽zj. Lemma 1 presents a mixed integer linear characterization for S(I,J) under the assumption that J consists of consecutive integers. All proofs are in Appendix.Lemma 1Let (I,J) be an IOS such thatJ={j|j̲⩽j⩽j¯},j̲⩽j¯, and let constant M>1. Then s∈S(I,J) if and only if s∈S0such that constraints(6)zj⩽v(xi)+(1-yj(xi))M∀xi∈X(7)v(xi)⩽zj+yj(xi)M∀xi∈X(8)∑xi∈Xyj(xi)=jhold for v(xi) and somezj∈[0,1],yj(xi)∈{0,1},j∈{j̲-1,j¯}⧹{0,|X|}so that(9)yj¯(xi)=yj̲-1(xi)∀xi∈I¯,if|I|⩾|J|yj¯(xi)-yj̲-1(xi)=1∀xi∈I,if|I|<|J|also hold (with notational conventions y0(xi)=0,y∣X∣(xi)=1).For example, the statement “alternatives x2 and x3 are the two most preferred among {x1,x2,x3,x4} with regard to attribute a1” is modeled with the IOS (I,J,X,A′)=({x2,x3},{1,2},{x1,x2,x3,x4}, {a1}) and can be characterized by constraintsz2⩽si1+(1-y2(xi))M,si1⩽z2+y2(xi)M,y2(xi)∈{0,1}∀i=1,2,3,4y2(x1)+y2(x2)+y2(x3)+y2(x4)=2,z2∈[0,1],y2(x1)=y0(x1)=0,y2(x4)=y0(x4)=0.Because the only feasible solution for the binary variables is (y2(x1),y2(x2),y2(x3),y2(x4))=(0,1,1,0), the above constraints simplify to z2⩽s21,z2⩽s31,z2⩾s11 and z2⩾s41. Indeed, Lemma 1 does not employ binary variables to model convex feasible regions. According to Salo and Punkka (2005), S(I,J) is convex if and only if J={1,…,∣I∣} or J={∣X∣−∣I∣+1,…,∣X∣}. With such sets J, the constraints (6)–(9) simplify toz|I|⩽v(xi)∀xi∈I,z|I|⩾v(xi)∀xi∈I¯ifJ={1,…,|I|}orz|X|-|I|⩾v(xi)∀xi∈I,z|X|-|I|⩽v(xi)∀xi∈I¯,ifJ={|X|-|I|+1,…,|X|}.The rationales for modeling S(I,J) withJ={j̲,…,j¯}can be applied to model a general S(I,J). Any set J can be partitioned into subsets Jk, which each consist of consecutive rankings. The min-partition of set J is the unique division of J into a minimal number of such sets Jk.Definition 4Sets Jk, k=1,…, K, are the min-partition of non-empty J⊂{1,…, ∣X∣}, ifJ=∪k=1KJk,∅≠Jk={j|jk̲⩽j⩽jk¯}for somejk̲,jk¯, for all k=1,…, K, andjk¯<jk+1̲-1∀k=1,…,K-1.For example, the min-partition of J={1,2,4,5,7} is J1={1,2}, J2={4,5},J3={7}.Let sets Jkbe the min-partition of J. If ∣I∣⩾∣J∣, the rankings ofxi∈I¯are not in the sets Jk. Therefore, if the ranking ofxi∈I¯is at mostjk¯, it must also be smaller thanjk. If ∣I∣<∣J∣, the ranking of xi∈I is in Jkfor some k∈ {1,…,K}. Thus, if it is smaller thanjk, it must be at mostjk-1¯. However, the ranking of xi∈I cannot be smaller thanj1or larger thanjK¯. Theorem 1 presents a mixed integer linear formulation of S(I,J) for a general IOS.Theorem 1Let (I,J) be an IOS, sets Jk, k=1,…,K the min-partition of J andj∪(J)=∪k=1K{jk̲-1,jk¯}⧹{0,|X|}. Then, s∈S(I,J) if and only if s∈S0such that constraints(6)–(8)hold for v(xi) and some zj, yj(xi)∈{0,1}, for all j∈j∪(J) so that(10)yjk¯(xi)-yjk̲-1(xi)=0∀k=1,…,K,∀xi∈I¯,if|I|⩾|J|yjk-1¯(xi)-yjk̲-1(xi)=0∀k=1,…,K+1,∀xi∈I,if|I|<|J|holds (with notational conventionsy0(xi)=0,y|X|(xi)=1,yj0¯(xi)=0,yjK+1̲-1(xi)=1).For example, the statement “alternative x2 is either the most preferred or the least preferred with regard to a1, among X={x1,…,x5}” is modeled with the IOS ({x2},{1,5},X,{a1}). The min-partition of J={1,5} is J1={1},J2={5} and the index setj∪(J)={j1̲-1,j1¯,j2̲-1,j2¯}⧹{0,|X|}={0,1,4,5}⧹{0,5}={1,4}. By Theorem 1, the constraints (6)–(8) becomez1⩽si1+(1-y1(xi))M,si1⩽z1+y1(xi)M∀xi∈X,∑i=15y1(xi)=1z4⩽si1+(1-y4(xi))M,si1⩽z4+y4(xi)M∀xi∈X,∑i=15y4(x4)=4.Because ∣I∣<∣J∣, (10) yields the constraintyj1¯(x2)-yj2̲-1(x2)=y1(x2)-y4(x2)=0with k=2 and the redundant equationsyj0¯(x2)-y0(x2)=0andy5(x2)-yjK+1̲-1(x2)=0with k=1 and k=K+1=3, respectively.If there are P statements, the set of feasible scores is the intersection∩p=1PS(Ip,Jp,Xp,Ap)with independent variableszjp,yjp(xi)for the required indices j. However, if in some of these statements both X and A′ are equal, the computational effort required to solve dominance relations in∩p=1PS(Ip,Jp,Xp,Ap)can be decreased.If L>1 statements (Il,Jl,X,A′) are given among the same alternatives X, with regard to the same attributes A′, these statements concern the same rank-orderings R(X) and the same valuesvA′. Then, the intended interpretation yj(xi)=1 if and only if r(xi)⩽j allows the binary and milestone variables related to these statements to be modeled to depend on each other. This observation helps reduce the number of milestone and binary variables and makes it possible to impose more constraints on the binary variables. These modifications, in turn, improve computational performance.More specifically, for any index j which is used in modeling statements (Il,Jl,X,A′) (that is, j∈∪l=1…,Lj∪(Jl)), only one set of variableszjlandyjl(xi)is needed. Furthermore, across all the L statements (Il,Jl,X,A′) the binary variables can be assumed non-increasing in the sense thatyj(xi)⩽yj′(xi)whenever j′>j. For example, constraint y1(xi)⩽y3(xi) can be introduced for any xi, because violating this constraint would require that the ranking of xiis one (y1(xi)=1) and simultaneously higher than three (y3(xi)=0). Lemma 2 shows that for each s∈∩l=1,…,LS(Il,Jl), there exists a solution zj,yj(xi) forj∈∪l=1Lj∪(Jl),xi∈Xthat fulfills these conditions and constraints (6),(7),(8) and (10).Lemma 2Let (Il,Jl,X,A′), l=1,…, L, be IOSs such that⋂l=1,…,LR(Il,Jl,X,A′)≠∅ and letJind=∪l=1Lj∪(Jl). Let SL⊂S0be a set of scores such that(6)–(8)hold for v(xi),yj(xi)∈{0,1},zj∈[0,1]∀xi∈X,j∈Jind, so that constraints(11)yj1(xi)⩽yj2(xi)∀j1∈Jind⧹{maxJind},j2=min{j∈Jind|j>j1}and(10)on statements (Il,Jl), l=1,…,L also hold. Then,∩l=1LS(Il,Jl)=SL.According to Lemma 2, monotonicity constraints can be introduced for binary variables which relate to same sets X and A′, and each index j requires at most one set of variables zj,yj(xi). For example, the two statements (I1,J1)=({x1,x2,x3},{1,2}), (I2,J2)=({x4,x5,x6}, {3}) can be modeled with the two indices in Jind=j∪(J1)∪j∪(J2)={min J1−1, max J1}⧹{0,∣X∣}∪{minJ2−1, maxJ2}⧹{0, ∣X∣}={2}∪{2,3}={2,3} instead of three. As a consequence, the number of binary variables drops from 3∣X∣ to 2∣X∣. The constraints y2(xi)⩽y3(xi)∀xi∈X also reduce the number of possible binary variable combinations. Furthermore, the introduction of monotonicity constraints simplifies constraints (10) of Theorem 1 as follows.Lemma 3Let (I,J) be an IOS and let(11)hold for Jind=j∪(J). Then, constraints(10)are equivalent to constraints∑xi∈I¯∑k=1K[yjk¯(xi)-yjk̲-1(xi)]=0,if|I|⩾|J|∑xi∈I∑k=1K[yjk¯(xi)-yjk̲-1(xi)]=|I|,if|I|<|J|.Assume that only several incomplete ordinal statements (Il,Jl,Xl,Al′) are used in modeling preferences among alternativesX∼⊂X∗, and that this setX∼and the sets Xlin these statements do not include the hypothetical alternatives{x1∗,…,xn∗}whose values are equal to the attribute weights. Then, no matter what the preference statements about the attribute weights are, the resulting feasible region always includes score matrix s so that sij=skj=0 for all j=1,…, n, for any i and k so that{xi,xk}⊆X∼. Consequently, the minimum of the value difference V(xi)−V(xk) is not positive, and dominance relations are not likely. For example, if the statements (Il,Jl,Xl,Al′) are consistent with each other and each of them evaluates alternatives with regard to one attribute (that is, sets Alinclude only one attribute each), then xidoes not dominate xkunless (i) all attributes are considered (∪lAl=A) and (ii) xiis ranked better than xkwith regard to all attributes. Indeed, numerical statements are needed to complement ordinal information to exclude such extreme realizations of parameters, as suggested by Sage and White (1984).In practice, one often-used procedure to evaluate alternatives is to divide them into classes so that alternatives in ‘class one’ (alternatives I1) are preferred to those in ‘class two’ (I2), and so on. Such classification into p classes can be modeled with p−1 statements (Ik,Jk) in whichJk=j|∑l=0k-1|Il|+1⩽j⩽∑l=1k|Il|for k=1,…, p−1,∣I0∣=0. Often this ordinal information is complemented by assigning equal values to all alternatives in the same class to represent value differences between the classes (e.g., Lindstedt et al., 2007; Salo and Liesiö, 2006; Könnölä et al., 2007, see also Corner and Kirkwood, 1991). Our framework makes it possible to relax the assumption that all alternatives in the same class have exactly the same value. Yet, it makes it possible to define intervals for the values that the alternatives in a class can have and to constrain value differences between the classes. Thus, incomplete ordinal information can be used for ex ante sensitivity analysis on the values associated with the classes, for example.Technically, the alternatives’ values and value differences can be bounded by constraints on the milestone variables. Variable zjis a lower bound on the value of the alternative with ranking j – and consequently also on the values of alternatives with rankings smaller than j – and, similarly, an upper bound on the value of the alternatives with rankings j+1,…,∣X∣. Specifically, the following numerical bounds help complement the above classification procedure, but they can technically be used to complement other statements, too.(a)A statement that the value of the alternative with ranking j is at leastbjcan be modeled with the constraint zj⩾bj.A statement that the value of the alternative with ranking k is at mostb¯kcan be modeled with the constraintzk-1⩽b¯k.A statement that the value difference between the alternatives with rankings j and k (k>j) is at mostd¯j,kcan be modeled with the constraintzj-1-zk⩽d¯j,k.A statement that the value difference between the alternatives with rankings j and k (k>j) is at leastdj,kcan be modeled with the constraint zj−zk−1⩾dj,k, if k−j>1. If k−j=1, then the constraints (7) can be transformed into v(xi)+dj,k⩽zj+yj(xi)M.If variables zjare not used to model any IOS and therefore not defined, a redundant statement (I,J)=(X,{1,…,j}) can be introduced to allow numerical statements that employ zjand yj(xi). The above bounds constrain the milestone variables and consequently the scores of all alternatives in X, as well. Because this leads to a smaller feasible region for scores, dominance relations hold also after the introduction of these constraints. Therefore, the dominated alternatives can be ignored in the specification of these bounds if the DM is not interested in how they compare with non-dominated ones.The proposed model admits several kinds of ordinal preference statements as a complement to numerical information about the parameters of an additive value model. This is useful, because multi-criteria decision analysis methods are often applied to problems in which some attributes are described by numerical database entries, and for some attributes natural measurement scales do not exist (e.g., Mild and Salo, 2009). Although numerical evaluation of the latter attributes is used and may even be required to reach a single non-dominated alternative, the use of incomplete ordinal information on these attributes can reflect the DM’s preferences better and help identify and discard dominated alternatives. Indeed, screening is often the first task of a decision support process. It reduces the set of relevant alternatives and guides further work on data collection: As additional statements keep the already established dominance relations intact and may establish new ones, all evaluations and assessments can be focused on non-dominated alternatives. In effect, incomplete ordinal information offers novel possibilities for screening when only some attributes are described by numerical data or statements (cf. the example in Section 5). Discarding alternatives with incomplete ordinal information before thorough numerical assessment or data collection can save time and costs, because fewer alternatives need to be evaluated numerically.In group settings, the DMs may have different opinions about the alternatives’ performance or the relative importance of the attributes. In addition, their ability to understand and to answer the elicitation questions can differ. If the group seeks to establish a joint preference characterization, incomplete ordinal information can be used to model these different opinions. First, despite of the DMs’ differences, they may still agree on ‘less restrictive’ statements, such as “cost is among the three most important attributes”, or “alternative x1 is not the most preferred”. If the group’s analysis is assisted by a facilitator, she can even suggest such statements based on the group’s discussion. Ordinal information can even help the group focus its discussion on differences among their opinions instead of arguing over numerical parameters.Second, the flexibility of ordinal statements makes it possible to employ several preference elicitation processes in group settings. For example, all group members k=1,…, K can be asked to choose the three most preferred alternatives Ik, whereafter the group’s preferences are described by the IOS (∪kIk,{1,2,3}) so that all alternatives with ‘votes’ can be among the three most preferred alternatives. This group’s statement can be then specified by removing alternatives from the set I=∪kIk– on the condition that more than three alternatives have received votes. If an alternative is among the three most preferred ones by all DMs, an additional statement (∩kIk,{1,2,3}) can be introduced. Considering different attributes – or even all attributes holistically – with different sets J leads to additional statements and consequently reduces the set of feasible scores.We consider an illustrative example in which a student uses an additive model to help her select a business school for an MBA degree. The alternatives consist of the thirty US business schools which ranked best in the 2009 The Financial Times (FT) ranking (Top MBA Programmes, 2010). The student’s aim is to discard some of these schools with an additive multi-attribute model and to then examine more closely the schools that remain non-dominated after her analysis.The model consists of seven attributes, five of which are based on the data and the results of the FT 2009 annual business school ranking. The additional two non-educational attributes account for possibilities to pursue her hobbies. The evaluations with regard to these attributes have been added to this example to illustrate the application of subjective incomplete ordinal statements.The student performs the analysis in two phases. First, she makes use of the information in the FT’s data and results, and provides incomplete ordinal statements with regard to non-educational attributes. In the second phase, information on the non-educational attributes is further specified by acquiring more information about the schools that remain non-dominated after the preference statements in the first phase. The schools are denoted by X={x1,…,x30}. The attribute-specific evaluations are explained in the following. The data is summarized in Table 1.a1:FT overall ranking performance is evaluated using the interval of the schools’ overall rankings among X in 2007–2009 such that the best of the three rankings defines the lower boundj1(xi) and the worst rankingj1¯(xi)defines the upper bound of the ranking interval. This information is modeled with the preference statement(I,J,X,A′)=({xi},{j|j1̲(xi)⩽j⩽j1¯(xi)},X,{a1})for each school. However, if school xkoutperforms school xiin each of the three rankings, an additional constraintv1(x1k)⩾v1(x1i)is introduced even if the ranking intervals overlap.School x1 outperforms all other schools in each of the three rankings and is assigned a [0,1]-normalized score 1. No school is worst in all three rankings, and the student considers a fictitious school that ties ranking 30 each year to correspond to the least preferred level. Thus, constraint z29=0 is introduced. Comparing to these two points of reference, the student introduces two further milestones: all alternatives which are ranked among the ten best ones have normalized score of at least 0.5 and those outside of the top twenty cannot exceed score of 0.2. These statements lead to constraints z10⩾0.5 and z20⩽0.2.Salary expectation is based on the average alumni salary three years after graduation (sAin Table 1) and the weighted salary (sW) measures of the FT ranking. The student models the salary expectationx2ias an interval bounded by these two measures. She uses a linear value function which is normalized so that the smallest of the above measures amongX,minxi∈X{SA(xi),SW(xi)}=$92,863, gets a normalized score of 0 and the largest, $173,935, gets 1.Alumni recommendations are based on a query in which alumni were asked to name three business schools which would be their primary sources of recruitment. In the FT ranking, the results of this query have been converted into a rank-ordering (r3). In this example, the student exploits this rank-ordering as ordinal information about the scoresv3x3i(see (4)). The best-ranked and worst-ranked schools define the most and the least preferred levels, respectively.Employment expectations are modeled in the FT ranking using the percentage of graduates that are employed within three months after graduation (p(xi)). The share of students whose employment information is recorded in the FT data (c(xi)) is known, but varies from school to school. The student does not make assumptions about the employment of the alumni whose information is not available. She therefore accounts for all possibilities between the extreme cases that none of them and all of them are employed. This assumption results in the intervalsx4i∈[c(xi)p(xi),c(xi)p(xi)+(1-c(xi))]. She applies a linear value function such that the smallest employment rate among the schools (60%) corresponds to the least preferred level and 100% to the most preferred.Female students is measured through the share of female studentsx5i∈[0%,100%]in the FT data. In all schools in X, the share of female students is below 50%, and the student focuses on modeling the value between 0 and 50%. In this range, the student prefers more female students to less. She is also indifferent between changes from 0 % to 15% and from 15% to 50%. She approximates her preferences withv5N(x5)=ax5bin which a and b are defined so thatv5N(0.15)=0.5andv5N(0.5)=1.Hobby 1 is evaluated by the student. She divides the schools into five classes and constrains the normalized scores of the schools in these classes. Excellent schools are referred to by ‘E’ in Table 1 and their normalized scores fulfillv6N⩾0.9. They are preferred to very good (VG;v6N⩾0.6), which are preferred to good (G;v6N⩽0.8), followed by fair (F;v6N⩾0.1) and finally poor (P;v6N⩽0.1). The schools that belong to the same class can have unequal scores. The most and least preferred levels are not necessarily achieved by any of the schools in X.Hobby 2 is evaluated by the student. Her evaluation is based on an article, in which three persons familiar with this hobby have named ten best and five worst universities of X with regard to this hobby. These lists are quite close to each other: there are eight schools (schools IT10⊂X) that belong to all three top ten lists and four schools (IB5) that are assigned to bottom five in all three lists. Based on agreed schools, the student introduces preference statements (IT10,{1,…,10}) and (IB5,{26,…,30}). To exclude equal scores among all alternatives, she bounds the top ten schools’ normalized scores from below by 0.7, which also serves as an upper bound for schools whose ranking is worse than ten. Similarly, the normalized score 0.1 distinguishes between the five least preferred and the other schools. The most and least preferred levels are not necessarily achieved by any of the schools in X.The attribute weights are constrained by (i) two incomplete ordinal statements (I,J)=({a1,a2,a3},{1,2,3}) and ({a4,a5},{4,5}), (ii) ordinal statements w2⩾w1, w6⩾w7 and (iii) lower bound wi⩾0.05 for all attributes.With the above preferences, nine schools XND1={x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x8,x9,x10,x12} remain non-dominated, and the student examines them more closely. She first acquires more information about the schools with regard to Hobby 2 (a7) and states that among the non-dominated schools, x1 and x10 are the two least preferred. This is captured by the statement ({x1,x10},{8,9},XND1,{a7}). She also thinks that x2 is much better than other schools in XND1 and constraints the normalized score of x2 so that it exceeds those of others by at least 0.1:v7Nx72-v7Nx7i⩾0.1for xi∈XND1⧹{x2}. After these statements, the set of non-dominated schools is reduced to XND2={x1,x2,x3,x4,x5}.After further examination of the schools XND2 with regard to Hobby 1 (a6), the student is willing to tighten the bounds on variables zj. She bounds the fair schools’ (x4) normalized score to be at most 0.12 and the normalized scores of the very good schools (x1 and x3) to be at least 0.15 smaller than the those of the excellent schools (x2,x5), which are bounded from below by 0.98. After these specifications of preference information, x5 becomes dominated. The student decides to visit the four remaining schools.
