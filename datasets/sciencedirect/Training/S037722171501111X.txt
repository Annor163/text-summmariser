@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We develop a dynamic continuous-time theory of the competitive firm under multiple correlated uncertainties (output price uncertainty and output uncertainty as an example). In doing so, we completely generalize and extend the previous (one-period) comparative statics results (the marginal impact of each parameter on optimal output). Particularly, we relax the assumption of the statistical independence between the risks, and the restrictions on the coefficient of absolute/relative risk aversion. Furthermore, we generally show the impact of one risk on the aversion to another. Moreover, we show the role of the factor of correlation between risks on the decisions of the firm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Dynamic (stochastic) models have traditionally been adopted in the area of finance, especially in the area of portfolio management. Examples include Chronopoulos, De Reyck, and Siddiqui (2014), who examined investment decisions under price uncertainty using a constant relative risk aversion CRRA utility function; Alghalith (2012a) and Focardi and Fabozzi (2004). However, in the area of the theory of the firm, dynamic (especially continuous-time) analysis is scarce. Some of the literature on the theory of the firm under uncertainty focused on production risk using a static (one-period) analysis and a state-contingent framework. Examples include Shankar (2015), Serra and Lansink (2014) and Hardakar and Lien (2014).Other literature considered static models only under output price uncertainty (relying on certain assumptions). Examples include Boussemart, Crainich, and Leleu (2015), Rodriguez-Peurta (2015), Rodriguez-Peurta and Alvarez-Lopez (2015), Sandmo (1971) and Ishii (1977), among others.Some studies examined two sources of uncertainty. For example, Broll and Wong (2013) used a static analysis in the presence of output price risk and an independent background risk. Using a static model and relying on a diagrammatic analysis and assumptions regarding the coefficient of relative risk aversion, Dalal and Alghalith (2009) provided some comparative statics under output price risk and a (independent) multiplicative output risk.Some of the recent literature adopted static models under regret aversion and price uncertainty. Examples include Wong (2014) and Broll, Egozcu, Welzel, and Wong (2013), among others.In sum, the existing literature suffers a combination of the following limitations. Firstly, it adopts a static (one-period) analysis. Secondly, some of the literature adopts a single source of uncertainty. Thirdly, the decision analysis or comparative statics results impose restrictions on the coefficient of absolute/relative risk aversion (see, for example, Ishii, 1977; Rodriguez-Peurta and Alvarez-Lopez, 2015; Sandmo, 1971 and Dalal and Alghalith, 2009, among others). Furthermore, the literature on the theory of the firm under multiple uncertainties assumes a statistical independence between the risks. Examples include Alghalith (2010), who provided a static decision analysis under cost uncertainty and an independent output price uncertainty; Alghalith and Dalal (2009), who relied on a static model to show the impact of adding both output price risk and an independent additive/multiplicative output risk (and the impact of adding one of the risks to another) on the firm’s optimal output; and Viaene and Zilcha (1998). Consequently, the impact of a correlated risk (or the magnitude of correlation) on optimal output was not examined.In this paper, we overcome all of these limitations. In doing so, firstly, we introduce a dynamic continuous-time model of the theory of the competitive risk-averse firm under multiple uncertainties. Secondly, we generalize the comparative statics results. Thirdly, we relax the assumption of the statistical independence between the risks. Fourthly, we generally show the impact of one risk on the aversion to another. Moreover, we highlight the role of the factor of correlation between the risks on the decisions of the firm.We present a model of the competitive firm under both price and output uncertainties.11Other sources of uncertainty can also be considered.The dynamics of the risky output price are defined as(1)dpu=p¯du+σdWu1,wherep¯and σ are expected price and the volatility, respectively; Wu1 is a standard Brownian motion on the probability space(Ω,F,Fu,P),where{Fu}t≤u≤Tis the filtration. This formulation allows negative pricing (which is used in certain circumstances; see, for example, Huntowski, Patterson, and Schnitzer, 2012). The stochastic output is defined asYu=yu+Qu,where yuis the deterministic output and the control variable, while Quis a stochastic variable that represents output uncertainty. The dynamics of the output risk are given by(2)dQu=ψdWu2;Qt≡q,where ψ is the volatility, Wu2 is a standard Brownian motion and t is the initial time; σ, ψ andp¯∈Cb.Thus(3)E[Yu∣Ft]=yu+E[Qu∣Ft]=yu;t≤u.The dynamics of the firm’s profit are defined as(4)dπu=yudp+dQ−dCu(yu);dCu(yu)=cu(yu)du,where Cuis the deterministic cost function (with the regularity assumption c′(yu) > 0, c′′(yu) > 0). Therefore, the terminal profit is given by(5)πT=x+∫tT(p¯yu−cu(y))du+∫tTyuσdWu1+∫tTψdWu2,where x is the initial wealth andE∫tTσ(Quyu)2du<∞.The objective of the firm is to maximize the expected utility of the terminal profitV(t,x,q)=SupyE[U(πT)∣Ft],where V(.) is the (smooth) value function (Vx> 0, Vxx< 0), U(.) is a bounded and strictly concave utility function. By the martingalityV(t,x,q)=U(x).Letyt*andy¯tbe the optimal output in the presence and absence of both price risk and output risk, respectively; and let ρ be the factor of correlation between the two Brownian motions.Theorem(a)yt*<y¯tif ρ ≥ 0.∂yt*/∂p¯>0.∂yt*/∂σ<0if ρ ≥ 0.sign(∂yt*/∂ψ)=sign(−ρ).∂yt*/∂ρ<0.(a)Under well-known technical assumptions,22Even if the value function is not smooth, we can obtain solutions using the method developed by Alghalith (2012b). In addition, viscosity solutions can be obtained.the value function satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation (suppressing the notation)Vt+12ψ2(Vqq+Vxx)+ψ2Vxq+Supyt{(p¯yt−c(yt))Vx+12(yt2σ2+2ytσψρ)Vxx+ytσψρVxq}=0,(6)V(T,x,q)=U(x,q),where the subscripts x and q denote partial derivatives. The solution yields(7)(p¯−c′(yt*))Vx+(yt*σ2+σψρ)Vxx+σψρVxq=0,where c′(yt) is the marginal cost. Thus(8)yt*=−(p¯−c′(yt*))Vxσ2Vxx−ψρσ[1+VxqVxx].Vxx< 0, Vxq< 0, Vx> 0, thereforep¯>c′(yt*)if ρ ≥ 0; we note that under complete certaintyp¯=c′(y¯t).33See Sandmo (1971).Thus, optimal output under both price and output uncertainty is less than the certainty output (if both price and output are certain). This result is intuitive and it generalizes and extends Sandmo (1971) and Alghalith and Dalal (2009), among others. We note that Alghalith and Dalal (2009) relied on a static model (of output price risk and output risk) and the independence assumption to show that optimal output under both price and output uncertainty is less than the certainty output.Using (8) yields∂yt*∂p¯=−Vxσ2Vxx(1−c′′(yt*)Vxσ2Vxx)>0.Therefore, an increase in expected price increases optimal output. This result is a complete generalization and extension of Sandmo (1971) and Dalal and Alghalith (2009) (who obtained this result only if the coefficient of relative risk aversion R ≤ 1), among others.∂yt*∂σ=−2σy+ψρ[1+VxqVxx]σ2−c′′(yt*)VxVxx<0.Hence, an increase in the price risk reduces optimal output if ρ ≥ 0. This is a complete generalization and extension of Ishii (1977) and Dalal and Alghalith (2009) (who obtained this result under the assumptions of independence, R ≤ 1 and CRRA), among others.(9)∂yt*∂ψ=−ρσ[1+VxqVxx]1−c′′(yt*)Vxσ2Vxx.Thus, an increase in the output risk reduces (increases) optimal output if ρ is positive (negative). This result is a complete generalization and extension of Dalal and Alghalith (2009), among others.∂yt*∂ρ=−ψσ[1+VxqVxx]1−c′′(yt*)Vxσ2Vxx<0.□Thus, an increase in the factor of correlation reduces optimal output. We note that this is a pioneering result.This theory can have many practical applications, since many firms face joint price and output uncertainty. For example, many farmers face price risk and output risk due to weather and natural disasters.Central to our analysis is the magnitude and correlation between the stochastic variables. A non-negative correlation between the two risks is needed to establish the classical result under risk aversion (an increase in the risk reduces optimal output). This result is intuitive since a negative correlation is perceived as a diversification of the total risk (analogous to having negatively correlated assets in a portfolio); the opposite is true if the risks are positively correlated. This is also consistent with Result (e). The practical implication is that the firm needs to accurately measure the factor of the correlation between the two variables before adjusting its optimal output to an increase/decrease in the risk. Also, if ρ changes, the firm will have a convenient formula to directly adjust its optimal output.Result (b) is especially powerful (the most intuitive result), since, contrary to previous literature, it establishes a positively-sloped supply curve without any restrictions on the coefficient of absolute/relative risk aversion. It is also extremely useful to the competitive firm. Now the competitive firm can always increase/decrease its output if expected price (or price if the price is certain) increases/decreases.Another practical implication is that if the firm’s preferences are known, the above formulas provide a convenient way to calculate the marginal impact of each parameter on optimal output. Even if the preferences are not known, they can be estimated (using Taylor’s series or another method) and therefore, the marginal impacts can be estimated.We provided a complete generalization of the major results of the theory competitive of the firm under (multiple) uncertainty. In so doing, firstly, we introduced a dynamic model. Secondly, we completely generalized and extended the static results of Sandmo (1971) and Ishii (1977) (that assumed a decreasing absolute risk aversion DARA), among others. Furthermore, we generally showed the impact of one (correlated) risk on the aversion to another (see Gollier and Pratt (1996) and Pratt (1988) for a detailed discussion). In so doing, we showed that the impact of an increase in the output risk on optimal output is determined by the sign of the correlation factor between the two Brownian motions. Moreover, we showed that an increase (decrease) in the correlation factor reduces (increases) optimal output. These results are perfectly intuitive and have many potential applications. For example, many farmers face both price risk and output risk. Consequently, the firm should (accurately) measure the factor of correlation before adjusting its output.
