@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper examines the enhancement of static and dynamic travel range of electrostatically driven microbeams using shape optimization approach. Continuous functions of width and thickness are used for optimizing the geometry of both cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeams. Rayleigh–Ritz energy method is employed to compute the static and dynamic pull-in parameters. Particle swarm optimization and hybrid simulated annealing are used for shape optimization of microbeams. Constraints on design variables are imposed using penalty approach. Enhanced pull-in parameters obtained for variable geometry microbeams have been validated using 3-D finite element analysis. Optimized shapes of microbeams show significant improvement in static and dynamic travel range. Pull-in displacement is increased up to 54.92% for cantilever microbeam and 40.79% for fixed–fixed microbeam with hybrid simulated annealing. Effectiveness of particle swarm optimization is brought out through representative test cases. The convergence of the particle swarm optimization is approximately five times faster as compared to the hybrid simulated annealing, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electrostatically driven micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) devices are attracting widespread interest of engineers and researchers due to promising scaling properties, high energy density and low power consumption [1,2]. Electrostatically driven microbeams, which act as actuators have many practical applications such as microgrippers, microswitches, microrelays, sensors, etc. [3]. The major restriction on the use of electrostatically driven microbeams is the operational instability known as pull-in instability, which was experimentally first observed by Nathanson [4] and Taylor [5]. The pull-in instability occurs when electrostatic force goes beyond elastic restoring force of the structure which leads to sudden contact of structure with substrate and the device becomes nonfunctional. The critical value of voltage at which pull-in instability occurs is called pull-in voltage and the corresponding displacement of the structure is called pull-in displacement. Together they are known as pull-in parameters.As pull-in represents an operational doorstep for the MEMS system, an accurate estimation of pull-in parameters is crucial at the design stage of electrostatically driven MEMS devices [6–8]. Pull-in is desirable in applications like material property extraction [9] and switching operations [10]. However, it is detrimental to many applications like micromirror [11], biosensors [12,13], microresonators [14] and tuning of Atomic force microscope optical levers [15]. The motivation of the present investigation is to delay the occurrence of pull-in instability of electrostatically driven MEMS actuators for improving the device performance.Detailed description of modeling of electrostatically driven microactuator is given in the articles of Lee [16] and Batra et al. [17]. Microactuator can be mathematically modeled using the Galerkin’s method based reduced order model (ROM) [18,19]. Among electrostatically driven MEMS devices, fixed-fixed microbeams and cantilever microbeams are widely used and their pull-in instability has been thoroughly studied by various researchers. Hence, microactuators in the present analysis are modeled as fixed–fixed microbeam and cantilever microbeam. Dimensions of the microbeams under investigation indicate that computationally efficient Galerkin’s reduced order model can be used in the present analysis and the Rayleigh–Ritz energy based method as a solver. ROM is specially preferred for design optimization problems where repetitive analysis has to be carried out by an optimization algorithm until the objective function is extremized.It is well known that when the applied voltage is raised gradually, inertia of the structure becomes negligible for the system behavior. The critical value of voltage at this point is known as static pull-in voltage and the distance traveled by the tip of cantilever microbeam and mid point of the fixed–fixed microbeam is called as static travel range or static pull-in displacement [20]. Many researchers have presented the pull-in phenomenon and the methods to estimate the stability of static deflection of the beam type microactuators [21]. The stability of motion around deformed position of the electrode is addressed and this is particularly important since the behavior of these devices is non linear [2,22]. Therefore, there is a chance for a dynamic instability to provoke pull-in called dynamic pull-in, below the static instability limit of voltage [23]. The pull-in instability of the system in this situation is called as dynamic pull-in instability. Maximum static pull-in displacement of prismatic cantilever microbeam and fixed–fixed microbeam with rectangular cross-section is 45% and 40% of initial gap respectively.Electrostatic force distribution and mechanical stiffness of the structure are influenced by the shape of microbeams. Hence, shape optimization is most popular passive method to enhance the travel range of microbeams. Various researchers presented their study carried out in the past on the performance improvement of MEMS devices through shape variations. For example Abdalla et al. [24] optimized shape of microbeams for maximization of pull-in voltage. Lake et al. used optimization method for design of slotted MEMS resonator [25]. Joglekar and Pawaskar [26] used shape optimization using Nelder–Mead algorithm for performance improvement of the electrostatically driven microactuators. However, they did not account dielectric breakdown voltage as limiting voltage for actuation of MEMS devices which is one of the important constraint of electrostatic MEMS devices. Moreover, the rise in pull-in displacement is limited compared to its referential prismatic microbeams because of constant thickness or constant width while varying the geometry [27]. In the present study, an attempt is made to vary width and thickness of variable geometry microbeams using parametric functions to enhance the stable travel range of the device. To this end, hybrid simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization methods are used for shape optimization. Penalty approach for violation of constraints is employed.Aim of this paper is to present the conceptually novel design of electrostatically driven microbeams having enhanced travel range by shape optimization exploiting initial gap. While optimizing the shape, rise in applied voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown voltage [28].In the present paper, static and dynamic pull-in instability of microbeams subjected to DC step voltage is addressed. For structural analysis, Rayleigh–Ritz energy method, including various source of nonlinearity such as electrostatic force, midplane stretching and fringing field effect, is used for estimation of pull-in parameters. Reduced order model based on Galerkin’s approach is used for numerical solution of equations. Hybrid simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization are used for shape optimization of microbeams. Dielectric breakdown voltage is considered as upper limit of the rise in voltage. For prismatic microbeams, pull-in parameters are compared with experimental and numerical findings. Estimated pull-in parameters of variable geometry optimized microbeams are compared with 3-D finite element simulation package COMSOLTM[29].Shown in Fig. 1is the proposed electrostatically driven MEMS devices consisting of deformable electrode (fixed–fixed or cantilever microbeam) and a fixed electrode, separated by initial gapg^(x^)and is filled with the dielectric medium as air having permittivityɛ^. Throughout this article, all hatted (^) terms indicate dimensional quantities having their physical units. Deformable electrode is made up of linear elastic material having Young’s modulusE^and Poison’s ratioν^. Effective Young’s modulus asE^eff,where,E^eff=E^for wide beam ((b^>=5h^)) andE^eff=E^(1−ν2)for narrow beam ((b^<5h^)) [9]. Dimensions of the deformable electrode are, lengthL^,widthb^(x^)and thicknessh^(x^)at co-ordinatex^along length and the corresponding dimensions of the referential prismatic microbeam are lengthL^,widthb^pand thicknessh^p. The distance from mid-plane of the deformable electrode to rigid electrode is kept constant and it is denoted asg^m.I^(x^)represents area moment of inertia atx^. When a step voltage is applied between fixed and deformable electrode, attractive electrostatic force causes deflection of microbeam. Beyond a critical value of voltage, deformable electrode snaps the fixed electrode, resulting in collapse of the device. Value of voltage and the deformation at this point is calculated using Rayleigh–Ritz energy method. For analysis, potential energy of the system consist of following terms:(1)Strain energy due to bending of microbeam.Strain energy considering von Karman nonlinearity for mid-plane stretching, is applicable to fixed–fixed microbeam only [3].Electrostatic potential considering Palmer’s fringing field model [30].In the present investigation Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is applied for modeling. Total potential energy of the system can be expressed as [26],(1)Π^=E^2∫0L^I^(x^)(d2w^(x^)dx^2)2dx^+E^8L^[∫0L^[N^+A^(x^)(dw^(x^)dx^)2]dx^]×[∫0L^(dw^(x^)dx^)2dx^]−V^22∫0L^(ɛ^b^(x^)g^(x^)−w^(x^)+2ɛ^π[1+ln(πb^(x^)g^(x^)−w^(x^))])dx^Here,A^(x^)represents area of cross-section andw^(x^)represents displacement atx^.N^is the axial force due to residual stress. Width variationb^(x^)in terms of prismatic microbeam widthb^pand thickness variationh^(x^)in the form ofh^pfor both the microbeams is as follows:(2)b^(x^)=b^pb(x)(3)h^(x^)=h^ph(x)Here, functions b(x) and h(x) describe scaling ofb^pandh^prespectively. Thickness variation causes variation in initial gap, represented by the following equation.(4)g^(x^)=g^p+h^(x^)2−h^p2Here,g^prepresents initial gap between referential prismatic microbeam and substrate. For taking common reference for nondimensional form of the equation, the distance of mid plane of microbeam from the fixed electrode is taken as base, mathematically represented as(5)g^m=g^p+h^p2In order to generalize the analysis, following nondimensional terms are defined,x=x^L^,w(x)=w^(x^)g^m,ζ=b^pg^m,η=h^pg^m,γ=E^E^eff,α1=A^pg^2m2I^p,T^=ρ^A^pL4E^I^p,b(x)=b^(x^)b^p,g(x)=g^(x)g^m,h(x)=h^(x^)h^p,A(x)=A^(x^)A^p,N=N^L2EI^p,α2=ɛ0L^4g^2pE^I^p,A^p=b^ph^p,I(x)=I^(x^)I^p,V2=ɛ^b^pL^4V^22E^I^pg^m3,I^p=b^ph^p312,w(x,t)=w^(x^,t^)g^m,t=t^THere,A^pis the cross-sectional area andI^pis the area moment of inertia of the prismatic microbeam. The stretching ratio  η defines the degree of geometric nonlinearity, ζ represents fringe parameter, t represents dimensionless time and w(x, t)  is estimation of deflection of microbeam in dynamic mode. In this paper, effect of residual stresses is neglected. Using above mentioned nondimensional terms, potential energy equation in dimensionless form is(6)Π=12∫01I(x)(d2w(x)dx2)2dx+3γ4η2[∫01A(x)(dw(x)dx)2dx]×[∫01(dw(x)dx)2dx]−V2∫01(b(x)g(x)−w(x)+2πζ[1+ln(πζb(x)g(x)−w(x))])dxIn this section, pull-in parameters for static and dynamic operating conditions are estimated numerically.Normalized displacement of the microbeam can be represented as(7)w(x)=asϕ(x)Here, ϕ(x) is a shape function, satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. asis a constant determining the scaling of shape function in static mode. Boundary conditions for cantilever microbeam are as follows:w(x)|x=0=0,dw(x)dx|x=0=0,d2w(x)dx2|x=1=0,d3w(x)dx3|x=1=0On parallel lines, boundary conditions for fixed–fixed microbeam are,w(x)|x=0=0,dw(x)dx|x=0=0,w(x)|x=1=0,dw(x)dx|x=1=0From the available resources, shape functions chosen for cantilever microbeam is [26,31],(8)ϕc(x)=coshλx−cosλx−Dc(sinhλx−sinλx)(9)where,Dc=(cosλ+coshλsinλ+sinhλ)Similarly, shape function for fixed–fixed microbeam is(10)ϕf=coshλx−cosλx−Df(sinhλx−sinλx)(11)whereDf=(cosλ−coshλsinλ−sinhλ)Here, subscript c indicates entities referring cantilever and f referring fixed–fixed microbeam. The value of λ for cantilever isλ=1.875104and for fixed–fixed microbeam isλ=4.730041[31]. To find static pull-in parameters, it is characterized as bistable state of the system, mathematically expressed as [32],(12)dΠdas=0,d2Πdas2=0Eq. (12) are solved numerically using MATLABTM code. The value ofas=apsandV=Vpsis calculated numerically at static pull-in point. Subscript ‘ps’ represents pull-in in static mode.In dynamic mode due to sudden rise in voltage, deflection of microbeam becomes a function of time and space represented as w(x, t). Energy method is used for estimating dynamic pull-un parameters of parallel plates and torsional plates MEMS devices by Nelson and Barbastathis [33] followed by Joglekar and Pawaskar [26] for variable width microbeams. Approximation of deflection of microbeams w(x, t)  in dynamic operating condition is assumed by the Eq. (13).(13)w(x,t)=ad(t)ϕ(x)here, ad(t) indicates time parameter and ϕ(x) is spatial function defined in Section 3.1.

Two initial conditions for both microbeams are,(14)w(x,0)=0,∂w(x,0)∂t=0The transverse displacement of Euler–Bernoulli beam satisfy following mechanical boundary conditions,•Fixed–fixed microbeamw(0,t)=0,∂w(0,1)∂x=0,w(1,t)=0,∂w(1,t)∂x=0Cantilever microbeamw(0,t)=0,∂w(0,t)∂x=0,∂2w(1,t)∂x2=0∂3w(1,t)∂x3=0Response of the electrostatically driven MEMS devices up to dynamic pull-in voltage is periodic [26,32] and at pull-in point, velocity becomes zero, beyond pull-in response becomes non-periodic. For extracting dynamic pull-in parameters, conditions expressed in Eq. (15) hold true,(15)Π=0,dΠdad=0Dynamic pull-in parameters are estimated by solving Eq. (15) numerically using code developed in MATLABTM. In Section 3.3, pull-in parameters estimated using energy method are compared with data in the literature. For referential prismatic microbeams and variable geometry microbeams results are compared with 3-D simulation package COMSOLTM.Table 1shows comparison of pull-in voltage of prismatic microbeams, reported by various researchers with the pull-in voltage obtained by Rayleigh–Ritz energy method. The values of pull-in parameters estimated from code developed in MATLABTM show excellent agreement with the literature. In Table 1, only values of pull-in voltage are compared, pull-in displacement value is not mentioned by many researchers in their study.In addition to the comparison of pull-in parameters of prismatic microbeam, results are validated with 3-D FEA simulation using COMSOLTM MEMS multiphysics [29] module. Values of estimated pull-in parameters using energy method and 3-D FEA is presented in Table 2. Estimated pull-in parameters show good agreement with those obtained from 3-D FEA COMSOLTMOptimization problem under investigation is solved for selecting the best design of microbeams having maximum pull-in displacement. Appropriate side constraints, geometric constraints and behavior constraints are implemented through penalty approach. The minimum width and thickness constraints has been adopted from the handbook of design rules for PolyMUMPS [40]. Study on micromachining using gray scale lithography along with dry anisotropic etching presented by Waits et al. [41] indicates that present microfabrication facility is capable of generating the complicated 3-D features from silicon structures. To restate the objective of this paper for quick reference, the aim of this is to arrive at the width and thickness profiles which can maximize the pull-in displacement keeping the area of overlap and volume of the microbeam same as that of referential prismatic microbeam. Continuous width and thickness functions are used for varying width and thickness along the length. For cantilever microbeam it is mathematically expressed as,(16)bc(x)=y1(1−y2xy3)y4hc(x)=y5(1−y6xy7)y8On parallel lines, width and thickness variation for fixed–fixed microbeam is defined by following equations:(17)bf(x)=y1(y2+(1−y2)[(1−2x)2]y3)y4hf(x)=y5(y6+(1−y6)((1−2x)2)y7)y8Here, subscript c refers to cantilever and f refers to fixed–fixed microbeam. Width and thickness functions for cantilever and fixed–fixed microbeams has total eight parameters, y1,  y2,  y3,  y4,  y5,  y6,  y7,  y8. Width and thickness functions are symmetrical aboutx=0.5for fixed–fixed microbeam, in order to keep symmetry of loading and boundary conditions. This will rest assure that torsion and bending effects are not asymmetrical. Here, constraints on each design parameters is imposed to avoid non realistic solutions. Maximum and minimum width as well as thickness value is decided on the basis of dimensions of the microbeam available in the literature and minimum feature size which can be fabricated using microfabrication facilities. It is obvious that rise in pull-in displacement will bring rise in actuation voltage. For MEMS devices, rise in actuation voltage is restricted by the dielectric breakdown voltage of the fluid present between the two electrodes. In the present case, dielectric medium is taken as air, Paschen’s law of breakdown voltage is not applicable when the gap between two electrode is less than  4 µm [28]. Modified Paschen’s curve for the initial gap than 5 µ indicates, there is a low risk if the breakdown voltage is set approximately 50 V/µ [42]. Following equations represent objective function and equality and inequality constraints in normalized form.(18)Minimizef{Y}=−wps+Parea+Pvol+Pbmin+Pbmax+Phmin+Phmax+PvbdSubjectto:b^minb^p≤y1≤b^maxb^p0≤y2≤10≤y3≤∞0≤y4≤∞h^minh^p≤y5≤h^maxh^p0≤y6≤10≤y7≤∞0≤y8≤∞1−∫01b(x)dx=01−∫01b(x)h(x)dx=0V≤VbdIn the Eq. (18), f represents objective function with design vector Y and wpsis the pull-in displacement in static mode, wpdis the pull-in displacement in dynamic mode, to be maximized. Term P and C with different subscripts show penalties and cost for violating constraints respectively. For example, term Pareaand Carearepresents penalty and cost for violating constant area of overlap. Expression for penalty and cost of violation of different constraints are mathematically represented as follows:i.The term Pareaspecifies the penalty for violation of constant area of overlap of the variable geometry microbeam.(19)Parea=Carea(1−∫01b(x)dx)2The term Pvolquantifies the degree of violation of constant volume constraint,volume of the proposed microbeam should be same as referential prismatic microbeam.(20)Pvol=Cvol(1−∫01b(x)h(x)dx)2Penalty for minimum width constraint violation Pbmin, is expressed as,(21)Pbmin=Cbmin(min[0,bmin*(x)−bmin])2where,bmin*(x)represents minimum width of the microbeam defined by design parameters y1,  y2,  y3,  y4 at ith iteration. bminrepresents lower bound of the normalized width.The term Pbmaxrepresents the degree to which maximum width constraint is violated. Mathematically represented as,(22)Pbmax=Cbmax(max[0,bmax*(x)−bmax])2The termbmax*(x)represents maximum width of the variable geometry microbeam at ith iteration. bmaxrepresents the non dimensional upper bound of the width.Minimum thickness violation constraint is penalized using Phmin, mathematically represented as,(23)Phmin=Chmin(min[0,hmin*(x)−hmin])2The termhmin*(x)represents minimum thickness of the proposed microbeam for any combination of design parameters, y5,  y6,  y7,  y8 at ith iteration. hminrepresents the non dimensional lower bound of the thickness.The term Phmaxrepresents the degree of violation of maximum thickness constraint, represented as,(24)Phmax=Chmax(max[0,hmax*(x)−hmax])2The termhmax*(x)represents maximum thickness of the variable geometry microbeam configuration at ith iteration of optimization process. hmaxrepresents the nondimensional upper bound of thickness.The term Pvbdshows that if the actuation voltage is greater than break down voltage of dielectric medium, cost of penalty Cvbdis imposed,(25)Pvbd=Cvbd(min[0,Vbd−V])2The term Vbdrepresents breakdown voltage of the dielectric medium and V represents actuation voltage of proposed microbeam at ith iteration of optimization.The value of penalty in optimization is problem specific and user dependant. Hence, cost of penalty values are decided after taking several trials in MATLABTM code. The cost values for violation of various constraints are taken as,Carea=100,Cvol=1000,Cbmax=1000,Cbmin=1000,Chmax=10,000,Chmin=10,000,Cvbd=1000.Swarm intelligence (SI) is a very wide research domain of optimization and several algorithms have been developed under the roof of SI to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization was developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, which models social behavior of bird flocking in search of food [43,44]. In PSO, system starts with a random set of solutions and searches for optimum value by updating generations. Each candidate solution is known as particle and set of particles is called as swarm, moves in n- dimensional search space in a cooperative manner. Movement of each particle in swarm is performed by a variable called velocity, that is influenced by a local and a social factor [45]. Each particle moves through search space based on the best positions found so far by itself Pbestand the best position found by the swarm i.e. global best Gbest. Objective function (fitness function) value is calculated for each particle p in the search space Rn. Position and velocity of each particle at ith iteration is S(i) and Vel(i) respectively. Movement of each particle in PSO is influenced by three factors (i) Particle’s own direction search (ii) Best position of the particle itself (iii) Best position found by the whole swarm. After every iteration position and velocity of every particle is updated using equation(26)S(i+1)=S(i)+Vel(i+1)Vel(i+1)=uVel(i)+c1φ1(Pbest−S(i))+c2φ2(Gbest−S(i))Where u(i) is called ‘inertia’ of the particle, is the coefficient determining the effect of previous velocity rate on the current velocity, deciding self confidence of the particle. The coefficients c1, φ1 and c2, φ2 decide the impact of Pbestand Gbestrespectively. φ1 and φ2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, c1 and c2 are known as ‘individual’ and ‘social’ factors respectively. In the present study variable inertia model of PSO is adopted and change in inertia value is governed by,(27)u(i)=(us−uf)(l−1)(i−1)+ufHere, u(i) is the inertia model at ith iteration, us is the inertia at beginning and uf is inertia at the end. l is the number of iterations for variable inertia.Algorithm 1describes the pseudocode of PSO, code is developed in MATLABTM[46] for this algorithm. PSO has been used in design optimization of various devices. For example, Lake et al. [25] successfully used PSO for design of slotted MEMS resonators.Simulated annealing is the popular derivative free method of optimization problems solution established by Kirckpatrick [47], resembles with the behavior of system in equilibrium at finite temperature. The detailed procedure for optimizing the design variables of electrostatically driven microactuator is discussed in the study presented by Trivedi et al. [48].The code is developed for hybrid simulated annealing following Algorithm 2in MATLABTM[46].Balling cooling schedule is used here [49] for lowering the temperature, mathematically represented as,(28)θ=θQwhere, θ is the temperature, Q is the cooling factor defined as,(29)Q=(ln(Ps)ln(Pf))1/(N−1)Here, Psand Pfrepresents acceptance probability at first and final iteration respectively. N represents maximum number of iterations. The choice of Balling cooling schedule is made specifically for the following reason. As the optimization progresses, it is continuously decreasing the possibility of accepting worse solution. Probability of accepting the worse solution is defined by the Eq. (30)(30)p=Δfθwhere, Δf is the difference of objective function value of two consecutive iterations. It is successfully employed by Trivedi et al. [50] for shape optimization of electrostatically driven cantilever microbeam.In Section 4, the results obtained by implementing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and hybrid simulated annealing (HSA) to the objective function are presented and discussed.
