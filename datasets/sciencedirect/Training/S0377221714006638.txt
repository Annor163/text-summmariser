@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes and estimates a globally flexible functional form for the cost function, which we call Neural Cost Function (NCF). The proposed specification imposes a priori and satisfies globally all the properties that economic theory dictates. The functional form can be estimated easily using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques or standard iterative SURE. We use a large panel of U.S. banks to illustrate our approach. The results are consistent with previous knowledge about the sector and in accordance with mathematical production theory.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cost analysis has been an indispensable tool for economists, managers and engineers in evaluating firm’s performance. In this context, reliable estimates of cost functions are of great importance because they can assist in accurate decision making. Also, other related types of analysis such as efficiency evaluation, require the estimation of a cost function as a first step towards the final evaluation of firms.According to Henderson and Parmeter (2009), non-parametric methods are desirable from an applied standpoint since economic theory rarely provides closed form solutions to the models of interest. However, the ability to restrict a model to mimic economic theory underlying its creation is also a key feature in choosing an estimation method, so that appropriate tests of the model’s assumptions may be generated. In this context, according to Gallant and Golub (1984), one has to work with functions that are parametrically rich enough in order to be capable of reproducing all the properties that economic theory dictates. If this is not the case, then any restrictions imposed on parameters could limit the generality of inference. Thus, here we exploit the semi-parametric nature of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are rich in parameters, in order to impose all the properties that mathematical economic theory dictates regarding the cost function. In fact, our proposed method is consistent with other researchers, such as the work of Du, Parmeter, and Racine (2013) in the sense that it is able to handle multiple general shape constraints for multivariate functions, or the work of Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2012) and Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) who employ non-parametric least squares methods in order to ensure convexity.In this work, we propose and estimate a new cost function based on AANs which we call the Neural Cost Function (NCF) that has considerable advantages: (a) It is a global approximation to any arbitrary cost function; (b) it satisfies all the properties dictated by economic theory globally and not only over the set of inputs and outputs where inferences are drawn; (c) it provides a very good fit to real-world data because it is data driven; (d) it allows for arbitrary returns to scale; (e) it is relatively simple to estimate. Despite the fact that a small fraction of these desirable properties might also be possessed by one or other of the already known specifications, neither possesses all of them simultaneously.An empirical application investigating the model’s performance using Bayesian techniques illustrates our technique based on a large data set on all US commercial banks. We believe that the results of this study suggest that the proposed cost function is a useful approach for expanding conventional cost analyses.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 offers a brief discussion of the theoretical framework; Section 3 introduces the proposed cost function; in Section 4 the measures of interests are presented; Section 5 sets out the empirical analysis; Section 6 concludes.Despite the fact that the so-called production function is a totally different thing from a cost function, there is a close relationship between them in the sense that “the cost function contains essentially the same information that the production function contains”, the so-called duality of production and cost (Varian, 1992), which was established by Shephard (1953) and Diewert (1971). In simple words, duality implies that, for given values of the parameters of the cost function, we obtain the parameters of the production function and vice versa (e.g. Stewart, 2005) and has found countless applications in the literature (e.g. Yair, 1996).In this framework, it is of paramount importance to be able to find a suitable functional form for the cost function, a process which is not an easy task. Thus far, several functional forms for the cost function have been proposed in the relevant literature such as the Cobb-Douglas specification (Cobb & Douglas, 1928), and the Translog functional form (Christensen, Jorgenson, & Lau, 1971). However, both of these forms suffer from serious drawbacks, the two most important of which are the following: First, the Cobb-Douglas specification uses a naïve mathematical function, despite the fact the real-world data are quite complicated. Second, both specifications do not comply with the desired properties dictated by mathematical economic theory, such as monotonicity, curvature, and homogeneity conditions.In this context, some researchers have developed numerical (Gallant & Golub, 1984) and Bayesian techniques (O’ Donnell & Coelli, 2005) for imposing the aforementioned conditions that have provided very satisfactory results. However, when working in a rigorous context in accordance with modern economic theory, it is of great importance to estimate functional forms that satisfy the aforementioned conditions globally, a research topic which is “one of the most vexing problems applied economists have encountered” (Diewert & Wales, 1987) and remains “one of the most difficult challenges faced by empirical economists” (Terrell, 1996).It should be noted that, so far, no empirical study has imposed all the theoretical properties dictated by production theory, despite the prominent efforts of some researchers, such as O’ Donnell and Coelli (2005). Actually, only a small number of studies even report the degree to which the estimated functions satisfy these conditions (Reinhard & Thijssen, 1998). In fact, O’ Donnell and Coelli (2005) in a prominent paper induced, in a Translog output distance function, three (3) of the properties that production theory dictates, namely: (a) homogeneity, (b) monotonicity, and (c) convexity by imposing the needed restrictions on the set of the translog parameters. Our paper is fundamentally different from the work of O’ Donnell and Coelli (2005) in that we propose a Neural Network cost function which is formally proved to be a global approximator to any arbitrary cost function satisfying by construction, i.e. globally and a priori, all the theoretical properties dictated by economic theory and not only some of them over the set of inputs and outputs where inference is drawn, as e.g. in O’ Donnell and Coelli’s (2005) seminal paper.In this work, we propose and estimate the Neural Cost Function (NCF) which is based on ANNs. The non-linear and non-parametric nature of ANNs makes them very attractive for the estimation of a cost function given that the theoretical relationship is not known a priori (Zhang & Berardi, 2001). Of course, a serious drawback of ANN’s is that they are a-theoretical, in the sense that their estimated coefficients are not easily interpreted. However, their advantages make them clearly extremely useful in contexts requiring increased flexibility and limited intuition. The intrinsically nonlinear character of ANNs is helpful because it permits us to obtain a sufficiently flexible functional form which is capable of approximating any arbitrary cost function while enabling the a priori imposition of the properties dictated by the theory. Contrary to widely used local approximations such as the Translog (Christensen et al., 1971), the generalized Leontief (Diewert, 1971) or the symmetric McFadden form (Diewert & Wales, 1987), the NCF is a global approximation to the unknown function. The Fourier flexible form (Gallant, 1982) is also a global approximation but it requires a large number of parameters.Formally speaking, ANNs relate an output variable ϒ to certain input variables X′=[X1, …, Xn]. The input variables are combined to form K intermediate variables or projections Z1, …, ZKwhere:Zκ=X′βκ,κ=1,…,KAndβκ∈RKare parameter vectors. The intermediate variables are combined nonlinearly to produce ϒ:Y=∑κ=1Kaκφ(Zκ)where φ is an activation function, the aκ’s are parameters and K is the number of nodes (Kuan & White, 1994). By combining simple units with intermediate nodes, ANNs structures are capable of approximating any smooth function (Chan & Genovese, 2001). As demonstrated in Hornik, Stinchcombe, and White (1989, 1990), ANNs provide good approximations to a large class of arbitrary functions while keeping the number of parameters to a minimum. In fact, they are universal approximations of functions including their own derivatives (Hornik et al., 1990).In this section, we propose a novel cost function specification, the Neural Cost Function (NFC), and formally prove that it constitutes a global approximation to any arbitrary cost function. We start by offering some useful definitions and then we proceed by defining the proposed NCF formally.Definition 1Cost FunctionThe cost function is defined as:C(p,y)=minxpx:x∈DomVandp∈R+N, wherey∈R+Mdenote all the output vectors,p∈R+Ndenote all the positive input price vectors andDomV=y∈R+M:V(y)≠∅denotes the effective domain of the production setV(y)=y∈R+M.The cost function is defined for all possible output vectors,y∈R+M, and all positive input price vectorsp∈R+N.The cost function does not exist if there is no possible way to produce the output in question. In what follows, we will make the assumption that the production setV(y)=y∈R+M, is closed and bounded.Next, based on the definitions of open set, open covering, compact set, dense set and closure (A.1–A.5, Mathematical Appendix) we proceed by stating an important result (Theorem 1).Theorem 1ANNs as global approximatorsConsiderX⊆RNa compact subset ofRNfor some N∈Nand C(X) the space of all real valued functions defined on X. Letφ:X→Rbe a non-constant, bounded and continuous function. Then, the familyF={F(x)≡∑i=1NaiφwiTx+bi,ai,bi∈R,wi∈RN}is dense on C(X).The proof is a straightforward application of Hornik’s (1991) Theorem. □In order to be able to apply Theorem 1, we have to formally define the set of cost functions and then prove that this set is a compact subset ofR.Definition 2Set of Cost FunctionsIf a cost function is defined as:C(p,y)=minxpx:x∈V(y)andp∈R+Nthen, we define the set of cost functions to be⋃i∈I⊆Nminxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N.Next, given the definition of the set of cost functions, we have to prove that this set is a compact subset ofR, so as to make use of Theorem 1.Theorem 2The set of cost functions is compactIf the production setV(y)=y∈R+mis closed and bounded, then∀p∈R+Nthe set of all cost functions, defined as⋃i∈I⊆Nminxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N, is a compact set.See Mathematical Appendix. □Next, we proceed by stating two Theorems which prove formally that the NCF is a global approximator to any arbitrary cost function.Theorem 3The NFC is continuous, bounded and non-constantIf⋃i∈I⊆Nminxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N⊆Ris a compact subset ofRandφ:R+mxn→Ris a non-constant, bounded and continuous function, then all the functions of the formc(p,y)=payβ∏κ=1Kφακ(pγκ,yδκ), where:pa≡∏i=1Npiai,yβ≡∏j=1Myjβjandφακpγκ,yδκ≡φακpγκyδκwhere, in general:pξ=∏i=Npiξ,ξ∈Randyτ=∏i=1Myjτ,τ∈R. and,a∈RNandβ∈RMdenote vector parameters and ακ, γκ,δκ∈RKdenote the neural parameters, are also continuous, bounded and non-constant.See Mathematical Appendix. □Lastly, in view of Definition 1 and Theorems 1–4 that follow, we identify the conditions under which the proposed specification can approximate arbitrarily well any cost function.Theorem 4NFC a global approximatorIf the set⋃i∈I⊆Nminxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+Nis a compact subset ofR, then the family of functions defined asF=c(p,y)∈C(R):c(p,y)≡payβ∏κ=1Kφακpγκ,yδκ,α∈RN,β∈RM,ακ,γκ,δκ∈RKis dense in the set of cost functions.See Mathematical Appendix. □The result of Theorem 4 implies that NCF is a global approximator to any arbitrary cost function.Next, according to mathematical economic theory, a well-defined cost function should satisfy a number of properties.Definition 3Well-defined cost functionIf the cost function satisfies the following conditions, then it is well defined:(i)Non negativity, i.e. C(p, y)⩾0 for p>0.Non-decreasing in prices, i.e. if p′>p⇒C(p′, y)⩾C(p, y) for p, p′>0.Positively linearly homogenous in prices, i.e.∀λ∈Rand ∀p>0⇒C(λp, y)=λnC(p, y).Concave and continuous in outputs.No fixed costs, i.e. ∀p>0⇒C(p,0)=0.No free production, i.e. ∀p>0 and ∀y>0⇒C(p, y)>0.Non decreasing (proportional) in outputs, i.e. ∀θ∈[0, 1] and ∀p>0⇒C(p, θy)⩽C(p, y).Non decreasing in outputs, i.e. ∀y′<y and ∀p>0⇒C(p, y′)⩽C(p, y).∀p>0 and∀{yl}l∈L⊆Nsuch that ∥y ∥l→∞ as l→∞⇒C(p, yl)→∞ as l→∞.In this context, in what follows, we will proceed by formally imposing a priori in the proposed cost function the aforementioned properties. To this end, we state the following two (2) lemmas, setting out the conditions under which a cost function is well-defined.Lemma 1If the activation function φ, φ: X→Cm[0, 1], m=1, …, N is: (i) non-constant, (ii) bounded, (iii) increasing monotonic and (iv) convex, then the cost function of the form:c(p,y)=payβ∏κ=1Kφακpγκ,yδκhas the following properties:(i)Non negativity, i.e. C(p, y)⩾0 for p>0.Non-decreasing in prices, i.e. if p′>p⇒C(p′, y)⩾C(p, y) for p, p′>0.No fixed costs, i.e. ∀p>0⇒C(p, 0)=0.No free production, i.e. ∀p>0 and ∀y>0⇒C(p, y)>0.See Mathematical Appendix. □If the following conditions are satisfied:(a)γκ=0, ∀κ={1, …, K}ακ⩾0, ∀κ={1, …, K}δκ>0, ∀κ={1, …, K}βj⩾0, ∀j={1, …, M}Positively linearly homogenous in prices, i.e.∀λ∈Rand ∀p>0⇒C(λp, y)=λnC(p, y).Concave and continuousNon decreasing (proportional) in outputs, i.e. ∀θ∈[0, 1] and ∀p>0⇒C(p, θy)⩽C(p, y).Non decreasing in outputs, i.e. ∀y′<y and ∀p>0⇒C(p, y′)⩽C(p, y).And, in case the boundness assumption is relaxed:∀p>0 and∀{yl}l∈L⊆Nsuch that ∥yl∥→∞ as l→∞⇒C(p, yl)→∞ as l→∞.See Mathematical Appendix A. □The following main result (Theorem 5) summarizes the conditions under which the neural cost function (NCF) is consistent with all the properties that mathematical economic theory dictates.Theorem 5NFC is well-definedIf the following conditions are satisfied, then any cost function of the formc(p,y)=payβ∏κ=1Kφακpγκ,yδκis well-defined:(a)γκ=0, ∀κ={1, …, K}ακ⩾0, ∀κ={1, …, K}δκ>0, ∀κ={1, …, K}βj⩾0, ∀j={1, …, M}Thus far, we have formally proved that any cost function of the form:c(p,y)=payβ∏κ=1Kφακ(pγκ,yδκ)is a global approximation to any arbitrary cost function. The following proposition provides the form of the input factor demand.Proposition 1Input Factor DemandThe factor demand for every input i, i∈{1, …, N}, using the NCF specification, is given by the following expression:xi(p,y)≡∂lnc(p,y)∂pi=∂c(p,y)∂pipic(p,y)=aipiai-1∏i≠jN-1piaiyβ∏κ=1Kφακyδκpic(p,y),∀i∈{1,…,N}.The proof is a straightforward application of Shephard’s lemma (1953) and the NCF specification presented in Theorem 5. □An immediate outcome of factor input demands is the expenditure function of each input. To this end, the following lemma provides the form of each expenditure function.Lemma 3Expenditure functionIn every NCF function, the expenditure function for each input i, i∈{1, …, N} is given by the following expression:Ei(P,X)≡pixi=aipayβ∏κ=1Kφακ(yδκ)pic(p,y),∀i∈{1,…,N}.The proof is a straightforward application of Proposition 1. □The following Definitions 4 and 5 and Lemmas 4 and 5 provide the expressions for the Allen-Uzawa and Morishima elasticities, respectively, that are widely used in the literature.Definition 4Allen-Uzawa elasticityFor every cost function defined as:C(p,y)=minxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N, wherey∈R+Mdenote all the output vectors,p∈R+Ndenote all the input price vectors andDomV=y∈R+M:V(y)≠∅denotes the effective domain of the production setV(y)=y∈R+M, the Allen-Uzawa elasticity of substitution between inputs i and j is defined by the following expression:σij(p,y)≡c(p,y)∂2c(p,y)/∂pi∂pj∂c(p,y)∂pi∂c(p,y)∂pjThe Allen-Uzawa elasticity of substitution between inputs i and j using the NCF specification is given by the following expression:σij(p,y)=ajaiyβ∏κ=1Kφακ(yδκ)aipj-ajpiThe proof is a straightforward application of the definition of Allen-Uzawa elasticity and partial differentiation of NCF specification as stated in Theorem 5. □For every cost function defined as:C(p,y)=minxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N}, wherey∈R+Mdenote all the output vectors,p∈R+Ndenote all the input price vectors andDomV={y∈R+M:V(y)≠∅}denotes the effective domain of the production setV(y)={y∈R+M}, the Morishima elasticity of substitution between inputs i and j is defined by the following expression:σij(p,y)=pj∂2C(p,y)/∂pi∂pj∂C(p,y)/∂pi-pj∂2C(p,y)/∂pj2∂C(p,y)/∂pjThe Morishima elasticity of substitution, between inputs i and j, using the NCF specification is given by the following expression:σij=aj-1The proof is a straightforward application of the definition of Morishima elasticity and Proposition 1. □Given that aj, j∈{1, …, M} is unrestricted, then the Morishima elasticity could be either positive or negative allowing both for complements and substitutes.Next, one of the key concepts in economic theory is the notion of Returns To Scale (RTS) that describe what happens as the scale of production increases. Returns to scale refers to a technical property of production that examines changes in output subsequent to a proportional change in all inputs. If output increases by the same proportion, then there are constant returns to scale (CRTS). If output increases by less than that proportional change,there are decreasing returns to scale (DRS). If output increases by more than that proportion, there are increasing returns to scale (IRS). In this context, the following definition and lemma give the expression of RTS.Definition 6Returns to ScaleFor every cost function defined as:C(p,y)=minxipxi,xi∈domV,p∈R+N, wherey∈R+Mdenote all the output vectors,p∈R+Ndenote all the positive input price vectors andDomV=y∈R+M:V(y)≠∅denotes the effective domain of the production setV(y)={y∈R+M}, the RTS are defined by the following expression:RTS≡∑j=1M∂lnC(p,y)∂lnyjThus, the measure of RTS using the NCF is given by the expression:RTS=∑j=1Mβj+∑j=1M∑κ=1Kακδκ∂Φ′(δkY)∂ϒjThe proof is a straightforward application of the definition of RTS and partial differentiation of the logarithmic form of NCF. □In order to formally estimate the model, we will make use of logarithmic transformation. Therefore, every NCF of the formc(p,y)=payβ∏κ=1Kφακpγκ,yδκ, where a, β, ακ, γκ, δκdenote vector parameters and p, y denote 1xN and 1xM vectors of prices and outputs, respectively, has a representation of the form: C(P, Y)=aP+βϒ+AκΦ(δκY), wherea∈RN,β∈RM,Aκ=[a1,…,aK]γκ,δκ∈Rκ,P≡lnp,Y≡lnyand Φ(.)≡lnφ(.).Now, since prices and inputs are vectors, our cost function can be written in the form:C(P,Y)=∑i=1NaiPi+∑j=1MβjYj+∑κ=1KακΦδκ∑j=1MYjBy normalizing the above equation with some P, say PN, we get:C(P,Y)PN=aN+∑i=1N-1aiPiPN+∑j=1MβjYjPN+∑κ=1KακΦδκ∑j=1MYjPNwhich yields:C=aN+∑i=1N-1aiPi′+∑j=1MβjYj′+∑κ=1KακΦ′δκ∑j=1MYjwhere:C≡C(P,Y)PN,Pi′≡PiPN∀i∈{1,…,N-1},Yj′≡YjPN,∀j∈{1,…,M}andΦ′δκ∑j=1MYj≡Φδκ∑j=1MYjPN.Now, from Theorem 5, taking into consideration all the restrictions that economic theory poses, an estimable form of the NCF is the following:C=aN+∑i=1NaiPi′+∑j=1MβjYj′+∑κ=1KακΦ′δκ∑j=1MYjsubject to the set of constrains:{βj⩾0∀j∈{1,…,M},aκ⩾0∀κ∈{1,…,K},δκ>0∀κ∈{1,…,K}}.Next, turning to the expenditure functions presented earlier (Lemma 3), we have the following representation ∀i∈{1, …, N}:Ei(P,X)≡pixi=aipayβ∏κ=1Kφακ(yδκ)pic(p,y)By using its logarithmic transformation, as well as the fact that both prices and outputs are vectors, the expenditure function yields:Ei∗(P,X)=μi+∑i=1NaiPi+∑j=1MβjYj+∑κ=1KακΦδκ∑j=1MYj-C(p,y)+Piwhere:P≡lnp,Y≡lny,Φ(.)≡lnφ(.),Ei∗(P,X)≡lnEi(P,X)and C(p, y)≡ln(c(p, y), μi=lnai, ∀i∈{1, …, N} is a constant.By normalization with PNwe get:Ei∗(P,X)PN=μiPN+aN+∑i=1N-1aiPiPN+∑j=1MβjYjPN+∑κ=1KακΦδκ∑j=1MYjPN-C(p,y)PN+PiPNwhich yields:Ei′=λi+∑i=1N-1aiPi′+∑j=1MβjYj′+∑κ=1KακΦ′δκ∑j=1MYjwhereEi′≡Ei∗(P,X)PN,Pi′≡PiPN∀i∈{1,…,N-1},Yj′≡YjPN,∀j∈{1,…,M},Φ′δk∑j=1MYj≡Φδk∑j=1MYjPNandλi≡μiPN+aN-C(p,y)PN+PiPNBased on the above, the following system of equations has to be estimated:C=aN+∑i=1N-1aiPi′+∑j=1MβjYj′+∑κ=1KακΦ′δκ∑j=1MYjEi′=λi+∑i=1N-1aiPi′+∑j=1MβjYj′+∑κ=1KακΦ′δκ∑j=1MYj(Σ)Subject to the following set, S, of constrains:S={βj⩾0∀j∈{1,…,M},aκ⩾0∀κ∈{1,…,K},δκ>0∀κ∈{1,…,K}}.The above system of equations can be estimated easily using standard maximum likelihood estimation since it can be shown to have a linear transformation of the form:ϒ=Xθ+V,V∼NN+1(0,Σ⊗IT)withY0≡C-1=x0′θ,whereθ′=[αN;λ,…,λN;a1,…,aN;β1,…,βM;α1,…,αK]′,d=dim(θ)=2N+M+K+1Yi≡Ei=xi′θ,i=1,…,N.From now on, the Bayesian estimation of our system is straightforward since our prior is p(θ, Σ)∝p(θ)p(Σ). Therefore, we can choose non-informative priors of the form:p(θ)=I(θ∈Sθ),andp(Σ)∝|Σ|-N+22.Of course, the system could also be estimated using standard iterative SURE (See Econometric Appendix B).In recent years, statisticians have increasingly focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to simulate non-standard (multivariate) distributions. On the merits of the sampling theory approaches to inference see, for instance, Geweke (1986). In this context, increasing attention is now being paid to the so-called Metropolis–Hastings (M–H) (Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, & Teller, 1953, Hastings, 1970) and incorporates the Gibbs sampler as a special case. In this work, we make use of the Gibbs sampler; see Econometric Appendix A for further details.The dataset refers to the commercial bank and bank holding company database managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in the period 1989 to 2000. It is based on the Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) for all U.S. commercial banks that report to the Federal Reserve banks and the FDIC. More specifically, there are five (5) output variables, namely: (1) instalment loans (to individuals for personal/household expenses), (2) real estate loans, (3) business loans, (4) federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and (5) other assets (assets that cannot be properly included in any other asset items in the balance sheet). Also, there are five (5) input variables, namely: (1) labor, (2) capital, (3) purchased funds, (4) interest-bearing deposits in total transaction accounts and (5) interest- bearing deposits in total non-transaction accounts. For further details regarding the variables see Wang and Kumbhakar (2009).The following table summarizes the definitions on the corresponding input prices (see Table 1).At this point, it should be noted that due to the panel nature of the dataset and the small number of the time dimension, stationarity checks were obviously not conducted (Hamilton, 1994). Of course, such a procedure would be imperative for longer time series. As far as the results of our econometric investigation are concerned, Fig. 1illustrates the marginal likelihood as a function of K.Fig. 2shows the estimated RTS which are found to follow a Gaussian-like distribution centered around unity (1).This results implies, roughly speaking, CRTS, and is consistent, among others, with the findings of Wheelock and Wilson (2012) and, of course, mathematical economic theory according to which, as a result of the basic optimization principle, economic units generally exhibit CRTS.In Figs. 3 and 4the own price and the Morishima elasticities are presented. The own price elasticities are negative for all inputs, a finding which is consistent with mathematical economic theory and the so-called law of demand for certain classes of goods.The Morishima elasticities are all found to be positive implying that all inputs of the banking industry should be regarded as substitutes since any change in the factor price of one inputs would yield a rise in the demanded quantity of the other inputs.Additionally, the fact that the Morishima elasticities are not all around the same mean shows an asymmetric behavior regarding the substitution effect of inputs, which is consistent, inter alia, with the findings of Stiroh (1999).Given the well known critical views expressed, among others, by Blackorby and Robert Russell (1989), we do not report the Allen-Uzawa elasticity since it does not reveal any information about relative factor shares, and cannot be interpreted as a logarithmic derivative of quantity ratios to marginal rates of substitution.In Fig. 5the estimated posterior coefficient for i=1 is illustrated.The results imply that we have very satisfactory convergence to the posterior distribution with no multimodality or other labeling problems in the model. The remaining posteriors are available upon request by the authors due to space restrictions.Lastly, the correlation between the cost estimates based on the proposed NCF with the actual values of all the relevant cost functions in our dataset shows that the NCF captures almost entirely (98.5% approximately) the actual values of the cost function (Fig. 6).
