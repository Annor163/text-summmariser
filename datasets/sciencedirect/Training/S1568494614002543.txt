@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To remain competitive and to provide timely and accurate services, the decision maker or system analyst view the reliability and maintainability issues as a part of corporate quest to improve quality of the products/processes and services delivered. But the collected or available data available from the historical records are mostly uncertain, limited and imprecise in nature. Thus in such situation(s), it is difficult, if not impossible, to analyze the behavior and performance of the system up to desired degree of accuracy. Thus attempt has been made by the author for analyzing the behavior and performance of the system using Vague Lambda–Tau methodology. Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory has been used for representing the classical(crisp) data into triangular fuzzy numbers because intuitionistic sets are characterized by a truth membership function and false membership functions (non-membership functions) so that sum of both values is less than 1. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed and the effects on system mean time between failures are addressed. The performance analysis of the system has been investigated through a composite measure of reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) called RAM-Index which explore the effect of failure/repair rates on system performance. Based on their performance, the most critical component of the system has been investigated. The methodology improves the shortcomings of the existing probabilistic approaches and gives a better understanding of the system behavior through its graphical representation. The pulping unit of a paper mill situated in a northern part of India, producing approximately 200ton of paper per day, has been considered to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results obtained by proposed approach are compared with the existing fuzzy Lambda–Tau and the crisp methodologies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is well known that the conventional reliability analysis using probabilities has been found to be inadequate to handle uncertainty of failure data and modeling. This is mainly due to the fact that they required the large amount of data for analysis, which are difficult to obtain from various resources. If somehow they can be collected then they have a high sort of uncertainty and hence if the data are used as such in the calculations then the results may be highly uncertain. Thus, the probabilistic approach to the conventional reliability analysis is inadequate to account for such built-in uncertainties in the data. This problem was overcome by using the notion of the fuzzy set introduced by Zadeh in 1965 [1] in the evaluation of the reliability of a system. Using the fuzzy set theoretic approach [2] introduced the fuzzy state assumption and possibility assumption to give Profust and Possbist. Singer [3] presented fuzzy set theoretic approach to fault tree analysis. Chen [4] used the arithmetic of fuzzy numbers to evaluate system reliability. The concept of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy arithmetic has been used in the evaluation of the reliability of the system by the various researchers [5–8,4,9,10]. The applications of handling the uncertainties using linguistic preferences in supply chain management are addressed by the authors given in Tseng [11], Tseng and Chiu [12], Tseng et al.[13]In fuzzy set theory, the degree of belonging of element to the set is represented by a membership value in the real interval [0, 1] and there exists degree of non-membership which is complementary in nature. From latter point of view, it is true and acceptable that grade of membership and non-membership are complementary. But in real life situation, it is assumed that a certain object may or may not be in a set A to a certain degree, but it is possible to entertain some doubt about it. In other words, some hesitation about the degree of belongingness exists. This hesitation in the membership degree may be modeled by intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) defined by Attanassov [14] and has been found to be well suited for dealing with problems concerning vagueness. The concept of IFS can be viewed as an alternative approach to define a fuzzy set in a situation where available information is not sufficient for the definition of an imprecise concept by means of a conventional fuzzy set. Gau and Buehrer [15] extended the idea of fuzzy sets by vague sets. Biswas [16] pointed out that there were situations where IFS theory is more appropriate to deal with. Bustince and Burillo [17] showed that the notion of vague sets coincides with that of IFSs. Chen [18] presented the arithmetic operations between vague sets and a new method for analyzing the fuzzy system reliability based on vague sets. Shu et al.[19] proposed an algorithm to calculate the fault interval of system components by integrating both expert knowledge and experience in terms of providing the possibilities of failure of bottom events using intuitionistic fuzzy fault tree analysis. They applied their method to the failure analysis problem of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). Chang and Cheng [20] obtained fault interval and reliability interval of the PCBA with different membership function using fault-tree analysis. Taheri and Zarei [21] investigated Bayesian system reliability assessment in vague environment. As all the above researchers have analyzed the reliability index only for depicted the performance of the system. But, in general, reliability index alone is inadequate to give deeper idea about such type of systems’ behavior because a lot of factors exist which overall influence the systems’ performance and consequently their behavior. Thus it is necessary to include other reliability parameters into the analysis which affect the performance of the system directly. For this, Garg [22] approach may be used to compute various reliability parameters namely systems failure rate, repair time, expected number of failures (ENOF), mean time between failures (MTBF), etc. by using limited, imprecise and vague data in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In their analysis uncertainty in the collected/available data are removed with the help of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and the interaction among the various working unit of the system are modeled with the help of Petri nets.Moreover, in order to achieve the desired goals of production, it is expected that production system should remain operative for maximum possible duration. But unfortunately, failure is an unavoidable phenomenon associated with technological products and systems. Over time, however, a given system suffers failures and has to be brought back into the serviceable state through appropriate maintenance and repairs. So maintainability aspects must be included to achieve customer satisfaction and remain competitive. Proper maintenance planning plays a prominent role in reducing production costs. To this effect, the knowledge of behavior of system, their component(s) is customary in order to plan and adapt suitable maintenance strategies. The behavior of such systems can be studied in terms of their reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM). RAM as an engineering tool evaluates the equipment performance at different stages in design process. As the growing complexity of the industrial system become more complex, it is not so easy to calculate their RAM parameters by using collected or available data because of its vagueness, imprecise or limited in nature. Also large quantity of data is needed for estimating the parameters which is impossible to obtain due to rare event of component's failure, human errors and economic restraints. These challenges imply that a new and pragmatic approach is needed to access and analyze RAM of these systems because organizational performance and survivability depends a lot on reliability and maintainability of its components/parts and systems. Sharma and Kumar [23] model the performance of a urea plant, using historical data, through RAM analysis by applying Markovian approach. In their analysis collected data are used as such without quantification of involved uncertainties. Rajpal et al. [24] proposed a composite measure of reliability, availability and maintainability for measuring the system performance and called as RAM-Index by using artificial neural network to train the data. Apart from this, Garg et al. [25] gave a time dependent RAM-Index by utilizing uncertain data. In their analysis uncertainties was removed by using fuzzy approach and their membership values are obtained by using a nonlinear programming approach.The major disadvantages of the above approaches for analyzing the performance of a system is that they have considered the highest level of confidence of domain experts as 1. In other words, there is a zero degree of hesitation between the membership (acceptance) and nonmembership(rejection) function values. But in real life problems, the level of confidence of domain experts usually lies between [0, 1] according to expert's knowledge. Thus there is need for enhancing the above methodology by considering the degree of hesitation between the degree of membership functions and level of confidence domain experts should be less than one. Keeping these facts in mind and utilizing uncertain data, an approach has been provided which improve the above shortcoming by considering 0.2 degree of hesitation between the degree of acceptance and rejection and the domain of confidence level is ≤0.8. Along with that a time dependent RAM-Index has been proposed for measuring the performance of the system within this domain of confidence level. Thus it is observed from the study that by using limited, vague and imprecise data of the system, the behavior and the performance analysis of the complex repairable industrial system in terms of their reliability parameters may be calculated. For this, objective of the present investigation is divided into two folds. In the first fold, behavior of the complex repairable industrial systems are analyzed in the form of the various reliability parameters by utilizing the uncertain, limited or vague data, while in second fold, the effect of failure pattern on a composite measure of RAM-Index of industrial system has been assessed which help the system analyst to rank the components as per preferential order based on its past failure and repair rates data. To remove the uncertainty in the available/collected data, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are developed using fuzzy possibility theory. PN has been used for modeling and analysis of complex industrial systems and process due to its ability to model the dynamic of the system. The proposed approach has been illustrated through a case study of pulping unit of a paper mill, a complex repairable industrial system situated in the northern part of India. Sensitivity analysis on the system MTBF has also been addressed. A general RAM-Index has been used for ranking the systems’ components based on its performance. Major advantage of this index is that, by varying individual component's failure rate and repair time, the impact on the system's performance can be analyzed effectively to plan the future course of action. The results may be helpful for plant personnel for analyzing the system behavior and may improve the system performance by adopting suitable maintenance strategies.This section introduces some definitions and basic concepts related to intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are used for analyzing the behavior and performance of the complex repairable industrial systems.Petri Net, a graphical and mathematical modeling tool is used for studying a complex system, which is concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel and nondeterministic. The use of Petri nets for reliability analysis simplifies the task of the modeler considerably. It involves drawing a net representing a model of the system and marking it with the corresponding firing times of the transitions. Petri nets have, over the last four decades, attracted the attention of researchers in several areas ranging from computer science to social sciences. PN can be introduced either algebraically or graphically [26]. A Petri net is a 5-tuple, PN=(P, T, F, W, M0), where, P = {p1, p2, …, pm} is a finite set of places, T = {t1, t2, …, tn} is a finite set of transitions, F⊆(P×T)⋃(T×P) is a set of arcs, W:F→{1, 2, 3…} is a weight associated with the arcs in F, M0:P→{0, 1, 2, …} is the initial marking, P⋂T=ϕ and P⋃T≠ϕ. A standard PN consists of a set of “places” P drawn as circles, a set of “transitions” T drawn as bars and a set of directed arcs F. An arc connects a transition to a place or a place to a transition. Place may contain “tokens”, which are shown as dots. The “marking” or the state of a PN is defined by the number of tokens contained in each place and is denoted by M. The construction of a PN model requires the specification of the “initial marking” M0. A place is called an “input place” to a transition if an arc exists from it to the transition. A place is an “output place” if an arc exists from a transition to the place. A transition is said to be “enabled” when all its input places contain at least one token. If the enabled transition is “fired”, it removes one token from each input place and deposits one token in each output place. The firing of a transition modifies the distribution of tokens in places and thus produces a new marking for the PN. For a given initial marking M0, the “reachability set” S is defined as the set of all markings that can be reached from M0 by a sequence of transition firings.Similar to fault tree model, PN also represents graphically the cause and effect relationship and interaction among the working units of a system to be modeled [27]. As obtaining minimal cut sets in a fault tree model is a tedious process due to the large number of gates and basic events. Contrary to fault trees, Petri nets can more efficiently derive the minimal cut and path sets simultaneously [27,28]. PN has a static part as well as dynamic part. The static part consists of places, transitions, and arrows. Meanwhile the dynamic part is related with marking of graph by tokens, which are present, not present or evolves dynamically on firing of valid transitions. In this study, only the static part of PN is used to model the quantitative behavior of system, i.e. the tokens are omitted and it is assumed that transitions are not timed, i.e. they are immediate transitions.The concept of fuzzy set was introduced by Zadeh [1] in 1965, which can be defined on the universe of discourse U asA˜={<x,μA˜(x)>∣x∈U}, whereμA˜is the membership function of the fuzzy setA˜defined asμA˜:U→[0,1]andμA˜(x)indicates the degree of membership of x inA˜and its value lies between 0 and 1. In fuzzy set theory, the degree of acceptance is considered but does not consider the evidence against the degree of acceptance, i.e. there is zero degree of hesitation or uncertainty in the membership degree of x inA˜. But in real life, there is always an uncertainty exist in the membership degree and hence there is degree of hesitation between them. To incorporate that hesitation in the membership degrees, Attanassov [14,29] generalized the concept of fuzzy set and defined the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set(IFS) or called vague fuzzy set.Definition 2.1Intuitionistic fuzzy set.An IFSA˜in universe of discourse U is a set of ordered triples given byA˜={<x,μA˜(x),νA˜(x)>∣x∈U}which is characterized by a membership functionμA˜and a non-membership functionνA˜, whereμA˜:U→[0,1],x∈U→μA˜(x)⟶[0,1]νA˜:U→[0,1],x∈U→νA˜(x)⟶[0,1]with the conditionμA˜(x)+νA˜(x)≤1forallx∈UFor each IFS ofA˜in U, ifπA˜(x)=1−μA˜(x)−νA˜(x)forallx∈UthenπA˜(x)is called the degree of indeterminacy of x toA˜or hesitancy degree of x toA˜. Obviously, ifπA˜(x)=0, IFSA˜is reduced to fuzzy set. The complementary setA˜cof an IFSA˜is defined asA˜c={<x,νA˜(x),μA˜(x)>∣x∈U}. The grade of membership of x in the IFS (also called vague set) is bounded to a subinterval[μA˜(x),1−νA˜(x)]of [0, 1]. Gau and Buehrer [15] called this interval as a vague value. Therefore, the degree of membership of x in the vague setA˜is characterized by the interval[μA˜(x),1−νA˜(x)]. A typical illustration of a vague setA˜is shown in Fig. 1.Definition 2.2Intuitionistic fuzzy number.An IFSA˜is said to be an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) in the set of real numbersℝ, if its membership function is defined asμA˜(x)=0;x≤afA(x);a≤x≤bμ;x=bgA(x);b≤x≤c0otherwiseand1−νA˜(x)=0;x≤akA(x);a≤x≤bν;x=bhA(x);b≤x≤c0otherwisewhere0≤μA˜(x)+νA˜(x)≤1and a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4∈R such that b1≤a1≤b2≤a2≤a3≤b3≤a4≤b4, and four functions fA, gA, hA, kA:R→[0, 1] are called the sides of fuzzy number. The function fAand kAare nondecreasing continuous functions and the function gAand hAare non-increasing continuous functions.Definition 2.3α-cuts of the IFN.A useful tool for dealing with fuzzy numbers is their α-cuts. Every α-cut of a fuzzy number is a closed interval and a family of such intervals describes completely a fuzzy number under study. α-cut of a membership function is a crisp set which consists of elements ofA˜having at least degree α. In the case of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers it is convenient to distinguish following α-cuts: A(α) and A(1−α), and is defined, for membership function, asA(α)={x∈U:μA˜(x)≥α}while for non-membership function, it is defined asA(1−α)={x∈U:1−νA˜(x)≥α}={x∈U:νA˜(x)≤1−α}where α is the parameter in the range 0≤α≤1.According to the definition it is seen that every α-cut, A(α) or A(1−α), is a closed interval. Hence we haveA(α)=[AL(α),AU(α)]andA(1−α)=[AL(1−α)(α),AU(1−α)(α)], respectively whereAL(α)(α)=inf{x∈R∣μA˜≥α};AU(α)(α)=sup{x∈R∣μA˜≥α}AL(1−α)(α)=inf{x∈R∣νA˜≤1−α};AU(1−α)(α)=sup{x∈R∣νA˜≤1−α}Definition 2.4Convex intuitionistic fuzzy set.Membership functions ofμA˜(x)ofA˜is fuzzy – convex, i.e.μA˜(λx1+(1−λ)x2)≥min(μA˜(x1),μA˜(x2))∀x1,x2∈U,0≤λ≤1Non-membership functions ofνA˜(x)ofA˜is fuzzy – concave, i.e.νA˜(λx1+(1−λ)x2)≤max(νA˜(x1),νA˜(x2))∀x1,x2∈U,0≤λ≤1An IFSA˜in universe U is normal if there exist at least two points x1, x2∈U such thatμA˜(x1)=1andνA˜(x2)=1.Definition 2.5Triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number and interval arithmetic operations.A triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numberA˜with parameters a≤b≤c, denoted asA˜=<[(a,b,c);μ,ν]>in the set of the real numberℝ. In this case, its membership and nonmembership function can be given asμA˜(x)=μx−ab−a;a≤x≤bμ;x=bμc−xc−b;b≤x≤c0otherwiseand1−νA˜(x)=(1−ν)x−ab−a;a≤x≤b1−ν;x=b(1−ν)c−xc−b;b≤x≤c0otherwisewhere the parameter b gives the modal values of A and a, c are the lower and upper bounds of available area for the evaluation data. The α-cuts of the triangular vague set is defined in the closed interval form as below and shown in graphically in Fig. 2.A(α)=[a(α),c(α)]=[a+αμ(b−a),c−αμ(c−b)]A(1−α)=[a(1−α),c(1−α)]=[a+α1−ν(b−a),c−α1−ν(c−b)]∀α∈[01]where a(α), a(1−α) are the increasing functions and c(α), c(1−α) are decreasing functions of α.The basic arithmetic operations, i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers depends upon the arithmetic of the interval of confidence. The four main arithmetic operation on two triangular vague setsA˜=<(a1,b1,c1);μ1,ν1>andB˜=<(a2,b2,c2);μ2,ν2>described by the α-cuts are given below for the following intervals:A(α)=[A1(α),A3(α)]andB(α)=[B1(α),B3(α)],α∈[0 1], with μ=min(μ1, μ2) and ν=min(ν1, ν2)(i)Addition:A˜+B˜=[A1(α)+B1(α),A3(α)+B3(α)]Subtraction:A˜−B˜=[A1(α)−B3(α),A3(α)−B1(α)]Multiplication:A˜·B˜=[P(α),Q(α)], whereP(α)=min(A1(α)·B1(α),A1(α)·B3(α),A3(α)·B1(α),A3(α)·B3(α))andQ(α)=max(A1(α)·B1(α),A1(α)·B3(α),A3(α)·B1(α),A3(α)·B3(α))Division:A˜÷B˜=[A1(α)÷B3(α),A3(α)÷B1(α)], if0∉[B1(α),B3(α)]The present study is valid for a constant failure rate and repair time model, i.e. parameters of failure rate and repair times follows the exponential distribution. For any repairable system, reliability, availability and maintainability factors are important task for assessing and increasing the production as well as productivity of the system. For this the mathematical equations of these RAM parameters and their consequently RAM-Index for increasing the system performance are described below [30].Reliability is a characteristic of an item (component or system), expressed by the probability that the item (component/system) will perform its required function under given conditions for a stated time interval [30]. From a qualitative point of view, reliability can be defined as the ability of the item to remain functional. Quantitatively, reliability specifies the probability that no operational interruptions will occur during a stated time interval. Mathematically, define continuous random variable T to be the time to failure of the component/system; T≥0, then the basic reliability function R(t) is defined for time to failure of the system (or subsystem) asR(t)=Pr(T≥t)=1−∫0tf(u)duwhere R(t)≥0, R(0)=1, andlimt→∞R(t)=0and f(t) failure probability density function.Based on the exponential distribution function, i.e. f(t)=λe−λt, the reliability function can be derived as(1)R(t)=exp[−∫0tλ(u)du]=e−λtwhere λ is the failure rate of the system.Availability in engineering design has its roots in designing for reliability as well as designing for maintainability, in which a ‘top-down’ approach is adopted, predominantly from the design's system level to its equipment level, and constraints on systems operational performance are determined [30]. Traditional reliability engineering considered availability simply as a special case of reliability while taking the maintainability of equipment into account. Availability was regarded as the parameter that translated system reliability and maintainability characteristics into an index of system effectiveness. Availability is defined as the probability that a system is operating satisfactorily at any point in time when used under stated conditions, where time considered includes the operating time and the active repair time. The simplest case for determining, point, interval, and steady-state availability is that of a single component or a system having the constant failure rate ‘λ’ and repair rate ‘μ’. The availability of the system, under the two possible state; operating or under repair, is defined as(2)A(t)=μλ+μ+μλ+μe−(λ+μ)tThe steady state availability of the system, A∞, is defined as(3)A∞=limt→∞A(t)=μλ+μ=MTBFMTBF+MTTRMaintainability refers to the probability that a failed component or system will be restored or repaired to a specified condition within a period of time when maintenance is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures [30]. Thus, maintainability deals with duration of maintenance outages or how long it takes to complete the (ease and speed) maintenance actions. The key maintainability figures of merit are the MTTR and a limit for the maximum repair time. To quantify the repair time, let T be the continuous random variable representing the time to repair a failed unit, having a probability density function of h(t), then the cumulative distribution function H(t) is defined below:P(T≤t)=H(t)=∫0th(u)duThis equation is the probability that a repair will be accomplished within time t.The MTTR is defined asMTTR=∫0∞th(t)dt=∫0∞(1−H(t))dtwhile maintainability of the system, M(t), at time t is expressed as(4)M(t)=1−e−(t/MTTR)=1−e−μtwhere μ is the repair rate of the system.As the performance of the system depends on the system configuration and system components’ reliability, availability and maintainability. All of these have depend on the available/ collected data from the various resources. But it is difficult to analyze the performance of the system by utilizing the uncertain, vague and imprecise data up to a desired degree of accuracy. Thus under these circumstances, RAM analysis of the system gives some idea to carry out design modifications to achieve high performance of the system. But it is not so easy to reach a concrete decision to know how to improve the performance of the system by using available or collected data. For this a composite measure of reliability, availability and maintainability, named as RAM-Index [24,31], for measuring the system performance by using historical data may be used. But the disadvantage of their index is that they does not considered the degree of indeterminacy between the membership values, i.e. there is zero degree of hesitation membership. To overcome this problem, a generalized time dependent RAM-Index has been introduced in the vague environment by considering the degree of hesitation between the membership function values and the confidence level of the domain experts. Thus, the generalized RAM-Index for analyzing the performance of the system is given in Eq. (5):(5)RAM(t)=w1×R(t)+w2×A(t)+w3×M(t)where R, A and M are taken as from Eqs. (1), (2) and (4), respectively andwi∈(0,1), i=1, 2, 3 are weights such that∑i=13wi=1. The value ofw= [0.36, 0.30, 0.34] has been used for calculating RAM-Index which is same as used by the researchers in literatures [24,31]. Eq. (5) can be rewritten in more elaborative form as(6)RAM(t)=w1×e−λst+w2×1λsτs+1+λsτsλsτs+1e−(λs+(1/τs))t+w3×(1−e(−t/τs))The advantage of this index is that by varying the component's failure rate and repair time individually, the impact onto the system's performance by the change in its behavior can be analyzed effectively to make the future course of action.
