@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In order to simulate the hesitancy and uncertainty associated with impression or vagueness, a decision maker may give her/his judgments by means of hesitant fuzzy preference relations in the process of decision making. The study of their consistency becomes a very important aspect to avoid a misleading solution. This paper defines the concept of additive consistent hesitant fuzzy preference relations. The characterizations of additive consistent hesitant fuzzy preference relations are studied in detail. Owing to the limitations of the experts’ professional knowledge and experience, the provided preferences in a hesitant fuzzy preference relation are usually incomplete. Consequently, this paper introduces the concepts of incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relation, acceptable incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relation, and additive consistent incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relation. Then, two estimation procedures are developed to estimate the missing information in an expert's incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relation. The first procedure is used to construct an additive consistent hesitant fuzzy preference relation from the lowest possible number, (n−1), of pairwise comparisons. The second one is designed for the estimation of missing elements of the acceptable incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relations with more known judgments. Moreover, an algorithm is given to solve the multi-criteria group decision making problem with incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relations. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the solution processes of the developed algorithm and to verify its effectiveness and practicality.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As a new extension of fuzzy sets [39], Torra [20] proposed the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) to enhance the modeling abilities of fuzzy sets. The core of a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) is a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) [26], which consists of several possible values for the membership degree. For example, suppose that a group of decision makers (DMs) are hesitant about some possible values as 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 to assess the membership of an element x to the set A, and the group of DMs cannot persuade one another to change their own opinions. In such cases, the membership of x to A can be modeled by a HFE represented by h={0.5,0.6,0.7}, which is different from the situations of using fuzzy sets and its extensions, such as interval-valued fuzzy sets [40], intuitionistic fuzzy sets [2], interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets [3], type-2 fuzzy sets [8], and fuzzy multisets [41]. Due to the advantages of handing imprecision whereby two or more sources of vagueness appear simultaneously [49], HFSs have attracted great attention from scholars and have been widely applied in decision making [15,16,26,34,35,42,43,46–48].In the process of decision making, the decision maker may feel comfortable to express his/her preferences by comparing each pair of objects and then construct a preference relation. The preference relation, as the most efficient and common representation of information, is composed of a collection of preference values, each of which is provided by an expert to express his/her opinion over a pair of objects by means of a predefined scale. With the different types of scales, many different types of preference relations have been proposed, such as the fuzzy preference relation [14,19], the multiplicative preference relation [17], the linguistic preference relation [7,9], the intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation [30,31], the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation [27], the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation [32,36], the interval-valued intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation [38], the interval fuzzy preference relation [29], the interval multiplicative preference relation [18], the triangular fuzzy preference relation [28], and triangular fuzzy reciprocal preference relation [21]. However, all these preference relations do not consider the hesitant fuzzy information, and thus they cannot provide all the possible evaluation values of the decision makers when comparing pairwise alternatives (or criteria), which is a common situation in our daily life. To solve this drawback, inspired by HFS, Zhu and Xu [45] first gave the definition of hesitant fuzzy preference relations (HFPRs) and then investigated their distinctive properties. Furthermore, Zhu and Xu [45] proposed a regression method to transform hesitant fuzzy preference relations into fuzzy preference relations (FPRs). Moreover, Zhu et al. [49] explored the ranking methods with HFPRs in the group decision making environments. Liao et al. [12] investigated the multiplicative consistency of HFPRs and its application in group decision making.Owing to the limitations of the experts’ professional knowledge and experience, or time pressure, the provided preferences in a HFPR are usually incomplete, especially for the preference relation with high order. That is to say, an expert may be unfamiliar with a certain object and thus unable to provide preferences associated with it, or an expert may be unwilling to express his opinions over some pairs of objects because of emotional factors. In such cases, it would be sensible not to force the expert to express “false” preferences over these objects, and thus an incomplete HFPR could be constructed, in which some elements are missing. As a result, estimation of the missing information in an expert's incomplete HFPR becomes an interesting and important research topic, however, nothing has been done about it. In this paper, we shall focus on solving this issue. To do this, we define the concept of additive consistent HFPRs and examine the characterizations of additive consistent HFPRs. Based on these new characterizations, we have first developed an algorithm for estimating the missing elements using only the known preference values in an acceptable incomplete HFPR with the lowest number of judgments, and then extend it to estimate missing elements of the acceptable incomplete HFPRs with more known judgments. A new algorithm is then laid out for handling multi-criteria group decision making problems with acceptable incomplete HFPRs.The remainder of this paper is set out as follows. Section 2 presents some basic knowledge about the FPR, the HFS, and the HFPR. Section 3 first introduces the concept of additive consistent HFPRs. The properties of additive consistent HFPRs are then studied in detail. Two approaches to constructing additive consistent HFPRs based on acceptable incomplete HFPRs are proposed in Section 4. After that, Section 5 develops an approach to multi-criteria group decision making based on incomplete HFPRs, and furthermore, a numerical example is given to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method in Section 6. The paper ends with some concluding remarks in Section 7.In this section, we will briefly recall the concepts of fuzzy preference relation, hesitant fuzzy set, and hesitant fuzzy preference relation.Definition 2.1[19]Let X={x1,x2,…,xn} be a set of alternatives, thenR=(rij)n×nis called a fuzzy preference relation (FPR) on X×X with the following conditions:(1)rij≥0,rij+rji=1,i,j=1,2,…,n,where rijdenotes the degree that the alternative xiis preferred to the alternative xjprovided by the decision maker. Especially, rij=0.5 indicates indifference between xiand xj; rij>0.5 indicates xiis preferred to xj, the larger the rij, the greater the preference degree of the alternative xiover xj, rij=1 indicates that xiis absolutely preferred to xj; rij<0.5 indicates xjis preferred to xi; the smaller the rij, the greater the preference degree of the alternative xjover xi, rij=0 indicates that xjis absolutely preferred to xi.LetR=(rij)n×nbe a FPR, thenR=(rij)n×nis called an additive consistent FPR if it satisfies the following additive transitivity:(2)rij=rik−rjk+0.5foralli,j,k=1,2,…,n.Torra [20] originally proposed the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets to manage the situations in which several values are possible for the definition of the membership of an element.Definition 2.3[20]Let X be a reference set, a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0,1], which can be represented as the following mathematical symbol:(3)A={〈x,hA(x)〉|x∈X},where hA(x) is a set of some values in [0,1], which denote the possible membership degrees of the element x∈X to the set A. For convenience, Xia and Xu [26] called h=hA(x) a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE).Let lhdenote the number of elements in the HFE h. Note that the number of values in different HFEs may be different and these values are usually unordered. Given a HFE h={hσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh}, it is assumed that are all possible values of the HFE h are arranged in an increasing order, and thus hσ(s) is the sth smallest value in h.We also note that different HFEs have different numbers of elements in most cases. In order to operate correctly when comparing two HFEs, Xu and Xia [34] gave the following rule: We can extend the shorter HFE until both of them have the same length by adding the same value to it several times. Zhu et al. [49] introduced a method to add elements in a HFE.Definition 2.4[49]Assume a HFE, h={hσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh}, let h+ and h− be the maximum and minimum elements in h respectively, and ς(0≤ς≤1) be an optimized parameter, which can be chosen by the decision makers according to their own risk preferences, then we callh¯=ςh++(1−ς)h−an added element.Especially,h¯=h+andh¯=h−can be respectively derived from the conditions that ς=1 and ς=0, which correspond with the optimism and pessimism rules introduced by Xu and Xia [34], respectively. That is, the HFE, which has fewer elements than the other one, will be extended by repeatedly adding the maximum value in it until it has the same length with the other one.Let h={hσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh},h1={h1σ(s)|s=1,2,…,lh1}, andh2={h2σ(s)|s=1,2,…,lh2}be three HFEs, then we defined the following operations on HFEs h, h1 and h2:(a)λh={λhσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh}, λ>0;h1⊕h2={h1σ(s)+h2σ(s)|s=1,2,…,l};h1⊗h2={h1σ(s)h2σ(s)|s=1,2,…,l};(h1/h2)={(h1σ(s)/h2σ(l−s+1))|s=1,2,…,l},For a HFE h={hσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh},S(h)=(∑s=1lhhσ(s)/lh)is called the score function of h, where lhis the number of elements in h. Assume two HFEs, h1 and h2, if S(h1)>S(h2), then h1>h2; if S(h1)=S(h2), then h1=h2.Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a fixed set of alternatives. Assume that the DMs hesitate between some possible preferences to provide paired comparison judgments of alternatives, and these preferences are collected into hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). On the basis of HFEs and fuzzy preference relations (FPRs), Zhu and Xu [45] developed a concept of hesitant fuzzy preference relations (HFPRs) as follows:Definition 2.6[45]Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a fixed set. A hesitant fuzzy preference relation (HFPR) H on X is denoted by a matrixH=(hij)n×n⊂X×X, wherehij={hijσ(s)|s=1,2,…,lhij}is a HFE, indicating hesitant degrees to which xiis preferred to xj. For all i, j=1, 2, …, n, hijshould satisfy the following conditions:(4)hijσ(s)+hjiσ(lhij−s+1)=1,hii={0.5},lhij=lhji,wherehijσ(s)is the sth smallest element in hij.Let H be a HFPR shown as follows:H={0.5}{0.4,0.6,0.7}{0.2,0.3}{0.5,0.7}{0.3,0.4,0.6}{0.5}{0.1}{0.8,0.9}{0.7,0.8}{0.9}{0.5}{0.3,0.4}{0.3,0.5}{0.1,0.2}{0.6,0.7}{0.5}.Based on Definition 2.4, Zhu et al. [49] used the optimized parameter ς to add some elements to an HFPR, and obtained a normalized hesitant fuzzy preference relation (NHFPR) defined as follows.Definition 2.7[49]LetH=(hij)n×nbe a HFPR,hij+andhij−be the maximum and minimum elements in hijrespectively, i, j=1, 2, …, n, and let ς(0≤ς≤1) be an optimized parameter. According to Definition 2.4, if we add some elementsh¯ij=ςhij++(1−ς)hij−to hij(i<j) and add some elementsh¯ji=(1−ς)hji++ςhji−to hji(i<j), then we obtain a HFPRH¯=(h¯ij)n×n. And for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, this preference relation should satisfy the following conditions:(5)l=lh¯ij=max{lhij|i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j},h¯ijσ(s)+h¯jiσ(l−s+1)=1,h¯ii={0.5},whereh¯ijσ(s)andh¯jiσ(s)are the sth smallest elements inh¯ijandh¯ji, respectively. Then, we callH¯=(h¯ij)n×na normalized hesitant fuzzy preference relation (normalized HFPR) with the optimized parameter ς, andh¯ijis a normalized hesitant fuzzy element (normalized HFE).Let H be a HFPR given in Example 2.1. According to Definition 2.7, and let ς=1, then we can get the normalized HFPRH¯as follows:H¯={0.5}{0.4,0.6,0.7}{0.2,0.3,0.3}{0.5,0.7,0.7}{0.3,0.4,0.6}{0.5}{0.1,0.1,0.1}{0.8,0.9,0.9}{0.7,0.7,0.8}{0.9,0.9,0.9}{0.5}{0.3,0.4,0.4}{0.3,0.3,0.5}{0.1,0.1,0.2}{0.6,0.6,0.7}{0.5}.In the following we shall first introduce the definition of additive consistent HFPR, and we then examine the characterizations of additive consistent HFPR.Definition 3.1LetH=(hij)n×nbe a HFPR on a fixed set X={x1, x2, …, xn} andH¯=(h¯ij)n×nbe its normalized HFPR with ς, if(6)h¯ijσ(s)=h¯ikσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5,foralli,j,k=1,2,…,n,s=1,2,…,l,andi≤j≤kwhereh¯ijσ(s),h¯ikσ(s), andh¯jkσ(s)are the sth elements inh¯ij,h¯ik, andh¯jk, respectively, then H is called an additive consistent HFPR with ς.Note that if a HFPR is additive consistent, for alli,k,j∈1,2,…,n, it is necessary to require i≤j≤k, otherwise,H=(hij)n×nwould be reduced to a crisp fuzzy preference relation.In fact, assume thath¯ijσ(s)=h¯ikσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5andh¯ijσ(s+1)=h¯ikσ(s+1)−h¯jkσ(s+1)+0.5, for all i, k, j=1, 2, …, n, and s=1, 2, …, l−1.Especially, if i=k, the above equations also should hold, that is,h¯ijσ(s)+h¯jiσ(s)=h¯iiσ(s)+0.5=1,h¯ijσ(s+1)+h¯jiσ(s+1)=h¯iiσ(s+1)+0.5=1But for the Definition 2.7 of the normalized HFE, we haveh¯ijσ(s)≤h¯ijσ(s+1),h¯jiσ(s)≤h¯jiσ(s+1)Thus,(7)1=h¯ijσ(s)+h¯jiσ(s)≤h¯ijσ(s+1)+h¯jiσ(s+1)=1Eq. (7) holds if and only ifh¯ijσ(s)=h¯ijσ(s+1),h¯jiσ(s)=h¯jiσ(s+1), which meansH=(hij)n×nis only a crisp fuzzy preference relation, that is, we can not construct a consistent HFPRH=(hij)n×naccording to the condition thath¯ijσ(s)=h¯ikσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5, for all i, k, j=1, 2, …, n, s=1, 2, …, l.Theorem 3.1For a HFPRH=(hij)n×nand its normalized HFPRH¯=(h¯ij)n×nwith ς, the following statements are equivalent:(8)H¯tk=(h¯ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,…,m,k=0,1,2,…,p)(9)(b)h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(j−1)jσ(s)+h¯jiσ(l−s+1)=j−i+12,∀i<j,s=1,2,…,l;(10)(c)h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jt−1jtσ(s)+h¯jtiσ(l−s+1)=t+12,∀i<j1<j2<⋯<jt,s=1,2,…,l.(a)⇒(b) Let i<j, and k=j−i. The expression (b) can be rewritten as follows:h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(j−1)jσ(s)+h¯jiσ(l−s+1)=k+12,∀i<jMathematical induction is used to prove this part. It is clearly true for k=1. Next if the hypothesis is true for k=n, i.e.,h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(i+n−1)(i+n)σ(s)+h¯(i+n)iσ(l−s+1)=n+12then for k=n+1, we haveh¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(i+n−1)(i+n)σ(s)+h¯(i+n)(i+n+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+n+1)iσ(l−s+1)=h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(i+n−1)(i+n)σ(s)+h¯(i+n)(i+n+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+n+1)iσ(l−s+1)=n+12−h¯(i+n)iσ(l−s+1)+h¯(i+n)(i+n+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+n+1)iσ(l−s+1)=n+12+h¯i(i+n)σ(s)−1+h¯(i+n)(i+n+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+n+1)iσ(l−s+1)=n+12−1+h¯i(i+n)σ(s)+h¯(i+n)(i+n+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+n+1)iσ(l−s+1)=n−12+32=n+22thus the expression (b) is confirmed.(b)⇒(a)h¯ijσ(s)+h¯jkσ(s)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1−h¯jiσ(l−s+1)+1−h¯kjσ(l−s+1)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=2+h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(j−1)jσ(s)−j−i+12+h¯j(j+1)σ(s)+h¯(j+1)(j+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(k−1)kσ(s)−k−j+12+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1+i−k2+h¯i(i+1)σ(s)+h¯(i+1)(i+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(j−1)jσ(s)+h¯j(j+1)σ(s)+h¯(j+1)(j+2)σ(s)+⋯+h¯(k−1)kσ(s)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1+i−k2+k−i+12=32thus the expression (a) is confirmed.(a)⇒(c) Let i<j, and k=j−i. can be rewritten as follows:h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jt−1jtσ(s)+h¯jtiσ(l−s+1)=t+12,∀i<j1<j2<⋯<jt,s=1,2,…,l.Mathematical induction is employed to prove the expression (c). It is obviously true for t=1, as it is reduced to the additive reciprocity property in Definition 2.1. Next, if the hypothesis is true for t=n, i.e.,h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jn−2jn−1σ(s)+h¯jn−1jnσ(s)+h¯jniσ(l−s+1)=n+12,∀i<j1<j2<⋯<jnthen it is true for k=n+1, we havezh¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jn−1jnσ(s)+h¯jnjn+1σ(s)+h¯jn+1iσ(l−s+1)=h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jn−2jn−1σ(s)+h¯jn−1jnσ(s)+h¯jnjn+1σ(s)+h¯jn+1iσ(l−s+1)=n+12−h¯jniσ(l−s+1)+h¯jnjn+1σ(s)+h¯jn+1iσ(l−s+1)=n−12+h¯ijnσ(s)+h¯jnjn+1σ(s)+h¯jn+1iσ(l−s+1)=n−12+32=(n+1)+12thus the expression (c) is confirmed.(c)⇒(a)h¯ijσ(s)+h¯jkσ(s)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1−h¯jiσ(l−s+1)+1−h¯kjσ(l−s+1)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=2+h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jt−1jσ(s)−t+12+h¯jk1σ(s)+h¯k1k2σ(s)+⋯+h¯kt−1kσ(s)−t+12+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1−t+h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jt−1jσ(s)+h¯jk1σ(s)+h¯k1k2σ(s)+⋯+h¯kt−1kσ(s)+h¯kiσ(l−s+1)=1−t+2t+12=32This completes the proof. □Furthermore, in the proof process, it is obvious that the differences of j2−j1, j3−j2, …, jt−jt−1 are not necessarily equal to 1. As a matter of fact, the differences do not have to be identical.Theorem 3.1 (b) differs from Theorem 3.1 (c) in that any sequence ofh¯ij1σ(s),h¯j1j2σ(s),…,h¯jt−1jtσ(s),h¯jtiσ(l−s+1)(for exampleh¯13σ(s),h¯34σ(s),h¯47σ(s),h¯71σ(l−s+1)) will work for Theorem 3.1 (c). But Theorem 3.1 (b) requires preference values to follow a consecutive order such ash¯12σ(s),h¯23σ(s),…,h¯(n−1)nσ(s),h¯n1σ(l−s+1). Therefore, Theorem 3.1 (b) is a special case of Theorem 3.1 (c).Theorem 3.2LetH=(hij)n×nbe a HFPR on a fixed set X={x1, x2, …xn} andH¯=(h¯ij)n×nbe its normalized HFPR with ς, thenH=(hij)n×nis additive consistent if and only if(11)h¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)=h¯pjσ(s)−h¯pkσ(s),∀i,p≤j<k,s=1,2,…,lNecessity: If a HFPRH=(hij)n×nis additive consistent by Definition 3.1, then we haveh¯ijσ(s)=h¯ikσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5,∀i≤j<kh¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)=0.5−h¯jkσ(s),∀i≤j<kSimilarly,h¯pjσ(s)=h¯pkσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5,∀p≤j<kh¯pjσ(s)−h¯pkσ(s)=0.5−h¯jkσ(s),∀p≤j<kThus,h¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)=h¯pjσ(s)−h¯pkσ(s),∀i,p≤j<kSufficiency: Ifh¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)=h¯pjσ(s)−h¯pkσ(s)∀i,p≤j<ks=1,2,⋯,l. Let p=j, sinceh¯jjσ(s)=0.5, thenh¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)=0.5−h¯jkσ(s),∀i≤j<kThat is,h¯ijσ(s)=h¯ikσ(s)−h¯jkσ(s)+0.5,∀i≤j≤kThus,H=(hij)n×nis additive consistent. This completes the proof. □Theorem 3.2 reveals an important property of an additive consistent HFPR. For upper (or lower) triangle of an additive consistent HFPR, the difference of the sth elements between any two columns should be a constant for all rows. Theorem 3.2 will play an important role in developing our algorithms to construct complete HFPRs based on an incomplete relation.Note that under certain initial values, we may obtain a matrixH¯=(h¯ij)n×nwith entries not in the interval [0,1], but in an interval−c,1+c, where c>0, −c indicates the minimum value of matrixH¯=(h¯ij)n×n; 1+c gives the maximum value of matrixH¯=(h¯ij)n×n. In this case, the obtained values have to be converted using a transformation function that preserves reciprocity and additive consistency, i.e.,f:−c,1+c→0,1, verifying(a)f(−c)=0.f(1+c)=1.Ifxσ(s)+yσ(l−s+1)=1,fxσ(s)+fyσ(l−s+1)=1,∀xσ(s),yσ(l−s+1)∈−c,1+c.Ifxσ(s)+yσ(s)+zσ(l−s+1)=32,fxσ(s)+fyσ(s)+fzσ(l−s+1)=32,∀xσ(s),yσ(s),zσ(l−s+1)∈−c,1+c.A linear function satisfying (a) and (b) takes the form(12)f(xσ(s))=φxσ(s)+β,φ,β∈ℜThis function is(13)f(xσ(s))=11+2cxσ(s)+c1+2c=xσ(s)+c1+2cwhich verify (c)f(xσ(s))+fyσ(l−s+1)=xσ(s)+c1+2c+yσ(l−s+1)+c1+2c=xσ(s)+yσ(l−s+1)+2c1+2c=1+2c1+2c=1and whenxσ(s)+yσ(s)+zσ(l−s+1)=32,f(xσ(s))+f(yσ(s))+f(zσ(l−s+1))=xσ(s)+c1+2c+yσ(s)+c1+2c+zσ(l−s+1)+c1+2c=xσ(s)+yσ(s)+zσ(l−s+1)+3c1+2c=3/2+3c1+2c=32then (d) are also verified.Owing to the increasing complexity of socio-economic environment, it is less and less possible for a single decision maker to consider all relevant aspects of the problem. Therefore, many organizations employ groups to make decision, which is called as GDM. A GDM with HFPRs can be described as follows: let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be the set of alternatives, andD=d1,d2,…,dmbe the set of DMs. Letλ=λ1,λ2,…,λmTbe the weight vector of DMs, where λt∈[0, 1], t=1, 2, …, m, and∑t=1mλt=1. Suppose that the DM dt∈D compares each pair of the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n) and constructs a HFPRHt=(hij,t)n×n=hij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lhij,tn×n, where hij,t(i<j) is a HFE, which indicates hesitant degrees to which xiis preferred to xj, and satisfies(14)hij,tσ(s)+hji,tσlhij,t−s+1=1,hii,t=0.5,lhij,t=lhji,twherehij,tσ(s)andhji,tσ(s)are the sth smallest elements in hij,tand hji,t, respectively.Utilizing Definition 2.7, we can transform all the individual HFPRsHt=(hij,t)n×n=hij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lhij,tn×n(t=1,2,…,m)into their normalized HFPRsH¯t=(h¯ij,t)n×n=h¯ij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,ln×nwith ς, which satisfy the following conditions:(15)l=lh¯ij,t=maxlhij,ti,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,t=1,2,…,m,h¯ij,tσ(s)+h¯ji,tσ(l−s+1)=1,h¯ii,t=0.5.whereh¯ij,tσ(s)andh¯ji,tσ(s)are the sth smallest elements inh¯ij,tandh¯ji,t, respectively.A collective HFPRHc=(hij,c)n×ncan be derived from all the individual HFPRsHt=(hij,t)n×n(t=1,2,…,m)by the following fusion method:(16)hij,cσ(s)=∑t=1mλth¯ij,tσ(s)(i,j=1,2,…,n,s=1,2,…,l)Theorem 3.3LetHt=(hij,t)n×n(t=1,2,…,m)be m HFPRs,H¯t=(h¯ij,t)n×n(t=1,2,…,m)be their normalized HFPRs with ς, andλt∈0,1,t=1,2,…,m,∑t=1mλt=1. IfHc=(hij,c)n×nis constructed through Eq. (16), then Hcis a HFPR.As per Eq. (16), for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, we havehij,cσ(s)+hji,cσ(l−s+1)=∑t=1mλth¯ij,tσ(s)+∑t=1mλth¯ji,tσ(l−s+1)=∑t=1mλth¯ij,tσ(s)+h¯ji,tσ(l−s+1)=∑t=1mλt=1According to Definition 2.6, Hcis a HFPR, which completes the proof of Theorem 3.3. □If all individual HFPRsHt=(hij,t)n×n(t=1,2,…,m)are additive consistent, then their collective HFPRHc=(hij,c)n×nis also additive consistent.Assume thatHt=(hij,t)n×n(t=1,2,…,m)are additive consistent, then for any i, j, k=1, 2, …, n, i≠j≠k, s=1, 2, …, l, we haveh¯ij,cσ(s)=∑t=1mλth¯ij,tσ(s)=∑t=1mλth¯ik,tσ(s)−h¯jk,tσ(s)+0.5=∑t=1mλth¯ik,tσ(s)−∑t=1mλth¯jk,tσ(s)+∑t=1m0.5λt=h¯ik,cσ(s)−h¯jk,cσ(s)+0.5which implies thatHc=(hij,c)n×nis additive consistent. □As a new emerging tool for representing preferences from a group of DMs, HFPRs can efficiently deal with the hesitant situation in which the decision makers are hesitant about some possible values for the preference degrees over paired comparisons of alternatives [49]. A complete n×n preference relation requiresn×n−1/2judgments in its entire top (or lower) triangular portion. However, in practical applications, due to DM’ not possessing a precise or sufficient level of knowledge of part of the problem, a DM may provide his/her judgments over some pairs of alternatives, and is unable or unwilling to give his/her judgments over the other pairs of alternatives, especially when the number of the considered alternatives is very large, in such cases, the DM usually constructs an incomplete HFPR, in which some elements are missing. Consequently, we next introduce the concept of an incomplete HFPR:Definition 4.1LetH=(hij)n×nbe a HFPR, wherehij=hijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lhij(i,j=1,2,…,n), then H is called an incomplete HFPR, if some of its elements cannot be given by the decision maker, which we denote by the unknown variable “x”, and the others can be provided by the decision maker, which satisfy(17)hijσ(s)+hjiσlhij−s+1=1,hii=0.5,lhij=lhji.for all hij∈Ω, where Ω is the set of all the known elements in H.In this case, the DM is unable to provide preference values for all pairs of alternatives, and thus some of them are missing.Example 4.1Let H be an incomplete HFPR shown as follows:H=0.50.3,0.5xx0.5,0.70.50.5,0.6,0.7xx0.3,0.4,0.50.50.7,0.8xx0.2,0.30.5In the following, based on Definition 2.7, we can use the optimized parameter ς to add some elements to an incomplete HFPR, and obtained a normalized incomplete HFPR defined as follows.Definition 4.2Assume an incomplete HFPR,H=(hij)n×n, and an optimized parameter ς(0≤ς≤1), where ς is used to add some elements to hij∈Ω(i<j), and 1–ς is used to add some elements to hji∈Ω(i<j) to obtain an incomplete HFPRH¯=(h¯ij)n×n. And for anyi,j=1,2,…,n,h¯ij∈Ω, this preference relation should satisfy the following conditions:(18)l=lh¯ij=maxlhiji,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,hij∈Ωh¯ijσ(s)+h¯jiσ(l−s+1)=1,h¯ii=0.5.Then, we callH¯=(h¯ij)n×na normalized incomplete HFPR with the optimized parameter ς.Let H be an incomplete HFPR given in Example 4.1. According to Definition 4.2, and let ς=1, then we can get a normalized incomplete HFPRH¯as follows:H¯={0.5}{0.3,0.5,0.5}xx{0.5,0.5,0.7}{0.5}{0.5,0.6,0.7}xx{0.3,0.4,0.5}{0.5}{0.7,0.8,0.8}xx{0.2,0.2,0.3}{0.5}LetH=(hij)n×nbe an incomplete HFPR, if (i, j)∩(k, l)≠∅, then the elements hijand hklin H are called adjacent. For a missing element hij, it can be determined indirectly if there exist a series of known elementshij1,hj1j2,…,hjtj.LetH=(hij)n×nbe an incomplete HFPR. If all missing element of H can be derived from its known elements, then H is called an acceptable incomplete HFPR; otherwise, H is called an unacceptable incomplete HFPR.Next, we extend the necessary condition [1,10,33] of acceptable incomplete fuzzy preference relations to the case of incomplete HFPRs.Theorem 4.1For an acceptable incomplete HFPR H, there exists at least one known element (except diagonal elements) in each line or each column of H, i.e., there exist at least n−1 judgments provided by the expert (that is to say, each one of the alternatives is compared at least once).LetH=(hij)n×nbe an incomplete HFPR andH¯=(h¯ij)n×nbe its normalized incomplete HFPR with ς, if the known elements ofH¯satisfy(19)h¯ij1σ(s)+h¯j1j2σ(s)+⋯+h¯jt−1jtσ(s)+h¯jtiσ(l−s+1)=t+12,∀i<j1<j2<⋯<jt,s=1,2,…,lthen H is called an additive consistent incomplete HFPR with ς.In the following we shall develop, based on Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 3.2, a simple and practical algorithm for estimating the missing elements of an acceptable incomplete HFPR with the lowest number of judgments (i.e., there are only n−1 known off-diagonal elements) and constructing a complete additive consistent HFPR:Algorithm 1Step 1: For a decision-making problem with a finite set of alternatives, X={x1, x2, …, xn}, the DM only compares n−1 pairs of alternatives on the set X and provides his/her judgments, each of which is expressed as a HFEhij=hijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lhij. All the judgments are contained in an acceptable incomplete HFPRH=(hij)n×nwith only n−1 judgments.Step 2: Utilize Definition 4.2 to obtain a normalized incomplete HFPRH¯=(h¯ij)n×nfromH=(hij)n×n.Step 3: Estimate all the missing elements inH¯=(h¯ij)n×nusing the known elements through Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 3.2, and thus yield an additive consistent complete HFPRH¯˙=(h¯˙ij)n×n. If this preference relation contains any values falling outside the unit interval [0,1], but within the interval [−c,1+c], then a transformation function f(x)=(x+c)/(1+2c) can be applied to preserve the reciprocity and additive transitivity, resulting in a new additive consistent HFPRH¯¨=h¯¨ijn×nwhich take the values within the unit interval [0,1].Step 4: End.Consider a decision-making problem with a set of six alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, 6). The DM assesses these six alternatives by pairwise comparison and provides his/her judgment as follows:h31=0.3,0.5,h32=0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,h34=0.1,0.2,0.3,h35=0.7,0.9,h36=0.3,0.4,0.6Step 1: By Definition 4.1 and the aforesaid information provided by the DM, we can construct the following acceptable incomplete HFPRH=(hij)6×6, where “x” denotes the unknown judgment.h¯24σ(1)=32−h¯12σ(1)−h¯41σ(4)=32−0.5−0.9=0.1,h¯24σ(2)=32−h¯12σ(2)−h¯41σ(3)=32−0.6−0.9=0h¯24σ(3)=32−h¯12σ(3)−h¯41σ(2)=32−0.7−0.9=−0.1,h¯24σ(4)=32−h¯12σ(4)−h¯41σ(1)=32−0.9−0.9=−0.3h¯42σ(1)=1−h¯24σ(4)=1.3,h¯42σ(2)=1−h¯24σ(3)=1.1,h¯42σ(3)=1−h¯24σ(2)=1,h¯42σ(4)=1−h¯24σ(1)=0.9Step 2: Utilize Definition 4.2 to transformH=(hij)6×6into a normalized incomplete HFPRH¯=(h¯ij)6×6(suppose that ς=0), which is shown as follows:H¯={0.5}x{0.5,0.5,0.5,0.7}xxxx{0.5}{0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}xxx{0.3,0.5,0.5,0.5}{0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8}{0.5}{0.1,0.1,0.2,0.3}{0.7,0.7,0.7,0.9}{0.3,0.3,0.4,0.6}xx{0.7,0.8,0.9,0.9}{0.5}xxxx{0.1,0.3,0.3,0.3}x{0.5}xxx{0.4,0.6,0.7,0.7}xx{0.5}Step 3: Utilize Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 to determine all missing elements inH¯=(h¯ij)6×6as follows:h¯12σ1=32−h¯23σ1−h¯31σ4=32−0.2−0.5=0.8,h¯12σ2=32−h¯23σ2−h¯31σ3=32−0.3−0.5=0.7h¯12σ3=32−h¯23σ3−h¯31σ2=32−0.4−0.5=0.6,h¯12σ4=32−h¯23σ4−h¯31σ1=32−0.5−0.3=0.7h¯21σ1=1−h¯12σ4=0.3,h¯21σ2=1−h¯12σ3=0.4,h¯21σ3=1−h¯12σ2=0.3,h¯21σ4=1−h¯12σ1=0.2h¯14σ1=h¯13σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯34σ1=0.1,h¯14σ2=h¯13σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯34σ2=0.1h¯14σ3=h¯13σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯34σ3=0.2,h¯14σ4=h¯13σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯34σ4=0.5h¯41σ1=1−h¯14σ4=0.5,h¯41σ2=1−h¯14σ3=0.8,h¯41σ3=1−h¯14σ2=0.9,h¯41σ4=1−h¯14σ1=0.9h¯15σ1=h¯13σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯35σ1=0.7,h¯15σ2=h¯13σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯35σ2=0.7h¯15σ3=h¯13σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯35σ3=0.7,h¯15σ4=h¯13σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯35σ4=1.1h¯51σ1=1−h¯15σ4=−0.1,h¯51σ2=1−h¯15σ3=0.3,h¯51σ3=1−h¯15σ2=0.3,h¯51σ4=1−h¯15σ1=0.3h¯16σ1=h¯13σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯36σ1=0.3,h¯16σ2=h¯13σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯36σ2=0.3h¯16σ3=h¯13σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯36σ3=0.4,h¯16σ4=h¯13σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯36σ4=0.8h¯61σ1=1−h¯16σ4=0.2,h¯61σ2=1−h¯16σ3=0.6,h¯61σ3=1−h¯16σ2=0.7,h¯61σ4=1−h¯16σ1=0.7h¯24σ1=h¯23σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯34σ1=−0.2,h¯24σ2=h¯23σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯34σ2=−0.1h¯24σ3=h¯23σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯34σ3=0.1,h¯24σ4=h¯23σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯34σ4=0.3h¯42σ1=1−h¯24σ4=0.7,h¯42σ2=1−h¯24σ3=0.9,h¯42σ3=1−h¯24σ2=1.1,h¯42σ4=1−h¯24σ1=1.2h¯25σ1=h¯23σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯35σ1=0.4,h¯25σ2=h¯23σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯35σ2=0.5h¯25σ3=h¯23σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯35σ3=0.6,h¯25σ4=h¯23σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯35σ4=0.9h¯52σ1=1−h¯25σ4=0.1,h¯52σ2=1−h¯25σ3=0.4,h¯52σ3=1−h¯25σ2=0.5,h¯52σ4=1−h¯25σ1=0.6h¯26σ1=h¯23σ1−h¯33σ1+h¯36σ1=0,h¯26σ2=h¯23σ2−h¯33σ2+h¯36σ2=0.1h¯26σ3=h¯23σ3−h¯33σ3+h¯36σ3=0.3,h¯26σ4=h¯23σ4−h¯33σ4+h¯36σ4=0.6h¯62σ1=1−h¯26σ4=0.4,h¯62σ2=1−h¯26σ3=0.7,h¯62σ3=1−h¯26σ2=0.9,h¯62σ4=1−h¯26σ1=1h¯45σ1=h¯44σ1−h¯34σ1+h¯35σ1=1.1,h¯45σ2=h¯44σ2−h¯34σ2+h¯35σ2=1.1h¯45σ3=h¯44σ3−h¯34σ3+h¯35σ3=1,h¯45σ1=h¯44σ4−h¯34σ4+h¯35σ4=1.1h¯54σ1=1−h¯45σ4=−0.1,h¯54σ2=1−h¯45σ3=0,h¯54σ3=1−h¯45σ2=−0.1,h¯54σ4=1−h¯45σ1=−0.1h¯46σ1=h¯44σ1−h¯34σ1+h¯36σ1=0.7,h¯46σ2=h¯44σ2−h¯34σ2+h¯36σ2=0.7h¯46σ3=h¯44σ3−h¯34σ3+h¯36σ3=0.7,h¯46σ1=h¯44σ4−h¯34σ4+h¯36σ4=0.8h¯64σ1=1−h¯46σ4=0.2,h¯64σ2=1−h¯46σ3=0.3,h¯64σ3=1−h¯46σ2=0.3,h¯64σ4=1−h¯46σ1=0.3h¯56σ1=h¯55σ1−h¯45σ1+h¯46σ1=0.1,h¯56σ2=h¯55σ2−h¯45σ2+h¯46σ2=0.1h¯56σ3=h¯55σ3−h¯45σ3+h¯46σ3=0.2,h¯56σ4=h¯55σ4−h¯45σ4+h¯46σ4=0.2h¯65σ1=1−h¯56σ4=0.8,h¯65σ2=1−h¯56σ3=0.8,h¯65σ3=1−h¯56σ2=0.9,h¯65σ4=1−h¯56σ1=0.9Thus,H¯.={0.5}{0.8,0.7,0.6,0.7}{0.5,0.5,0.5,0.7}{0.1,0.1,0.2,0.5}{0.7,0.7,0.7,1.1}{0.3,0.3,0.4,0.8}{0.3,0.4,0.3,0.2}{0.5}{0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}{−0.2,−0.1,0.1,0.3}{0.4,0.5,0.6,0.9}{0,0.1,0.3,0.6}{0.3,0.5,0.5,0.5}{0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8}{0.5}{0.1,0.1,0.2,0.3}{0.7,0.7,0.7,0.9}{0.3,0.3,0.4,0.6}{0.5,0.8,0.9,0.9}{0.7,0.9,1.1,1.2}{0.7,0.8,0.9,0.9}{0.5}{1.1,1.1,1,1.1}{0.7,0.7,0.7,0.8}{−0.1,0.3,0.3,0.3}{0.1,0.4,0.5,0.6}{0.1,0.3,0.3,0.3}{−0.1,0,−0.1,−0.1}{0.5}{0.1,0.1,0.2,0.2}{0.2,0.6,0.7,0.7}{0.4,0.7,0.9,1}{0.4,0.6,0.7,0.7}{0.2,0.3,0.3,0.3}{0.8,0.8,0.9,0.9}{0.5}As the preference relation contains values falling outside the interval [0,1] and c=0.2, a transformation function f(x)=(x+c)/(1+2c) is applied to the values of each HFE inH¯., yieldingH¯..=0.50.71,0.64,0.57,0.640.5,0.5,0.5,0.640.21,0.21,0.29,0.50.64,0.64,0.64,0.930.36,0.36,0.43,0.710.36,0.46,0.36,0.290.50.29,0.36,0.43,0.50,0.07,0.21,0.360.43,0.5,0.57,0.790.14,0.21,0.36,0.570.36,0.5,0.5,0.50.5,0.57,0.64,0.710.50.21,0.21,0.29,0.360.64,0.64,0.64,0.790.36,0.36,0.43,0.570.5,0.71,0.79,0.790.64,0.79,0.93,10.64,0.71,0.79,0.790.50.93,0.93,0.86,0.930.64,0.64,0.64,0.710.07,0.36,0.36,0.360.21,0.43,0.5,0.570.21,0.36,0.36,0.360.07,0.14,0.07,0.070.50.21,0.21,0.29,0.290.29,0.57,0.64,0.640.43,0.64,0.79,0.860.43,0.57,0.64,0.640.29,0.36,0.36,0.360.71,0.71,0.79,0.790.5Now, we consider an acceptable incomplete HFRPH=(hij)n×nwith more known elements (n−1 values at least).

However, if H is inconsistent, the preference values in H will not satisfy Eq. (6). In other words, there exist some differences betweenh¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)+h¯jkσ(s)and 0.5 for some i, j, k=1, 2, …, n, s=1, 2, …, l, and i<j<k. As0≤h¯ijσ(s),h¯ikσ(s),h¯jkσ(s)≤1for all i, j, k=1, 2, …, n one has0≤h¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)+h¯jkσ(s)−0.5≤(3/2). Thus, we can define a consistency measure for a HFPR as follows.Definition 4.6LetH=(hij)n×nbe a HFPR on a fixed set X={x1, x2, …, xn} andH¯=(h¯ij)n×nbe its normalized HFPR with ς, then a consistency index of a HFPRH=(hij)n×nis defined asCI(H)=1−∑i=1n−2∑j=i+1n−1∑k=j+1n∑s=1lh¯ijσ(s)−h¯ikσ(s)+h¯jkσ(s)−0.5(3/2)×l×n×(n−1)×(n−2)It is obvious that0≤CIH≤1. If CI(H)=1, then the HFPR H is additive consistent; otherwise,H=(hij)n×nis inconsistent, and the larger the CI(H), the closer the H is to a consistent HFPR.According to Definition 4.6, the consistency index of the complete HFPRH¯¨obtained in Example 4.3 is calculated asCI(H¯¨)=1, which shows thatH¯¨is a complete additive consistent HFPR and illustrates the validity of the proposed Algorithm 1.Similarly, we can calculate the consistency index of the complete HFPRH¯¨obtained in Example 4.4 asCI(H¯¨)=1, which shows thatH¯¨is also a complete additive consistent HFPR and further illustrates the validity of the proposed estimation procedure.Given a HFE, there exists a degree of deviation among different possible values that compound the HFE. It is easy to note that the deviation degrees of different HFEs are usual different and they can be interpreted as a DM's (or an organization's) degree of hesitancy. Zhang and Xu [44] presented the notion of the hesitancy index of a HFE is as follows:Definition 4.7[44]Given a HFE h={hσ(s)|s=1, 2, …, lh}, the hesitancy index of h can be defined as:h̶(h)=∑s>t=1lhhσ(s)−hσ(t)(1/2)×lh×(lh−1),iflh>1,0,iflh=1.Based on Definition 4.7, we next define the hesitancy index of an incomplete HFPRH=(hij)n×nas follows:Definition 4.8Given an incomplete HFPRH=(hij)n×n, the hesitancy index of H can be defined as:h̶(H)=∑hij∈Ωi≠jh̶(hij)#Ω−nwhere #Ω represents the number of the elements in Ω.As per Definition 4.8, in Example 4.3, we can calculate the hesitancy indexes of the incomplete HFPR H and its complete HFPRH¯¨as h̶(H)=0.3256 andh̶(H¯¨)=0.3237, respectively. It is obvious that the hesitancy index ofH¯¨is much closer to that of original incomplete HFPR H, implying that the hesitancy index in original judgments can be properly reflected by the proposed estimation procedure.Similarly, in Example 4.4, we can calculate the hesitancy indexes of the incomplete HFPR H and its complete HFPRH¯¨as h̶(H)=0.6189 andh̶(H¯¨)=0.6215, respectively. It is obvious that the hesitancy index ofH¯¨is much closer to that of original incomplete HFPR H, implying that the proposed estimation procedures can properly reflect the hesitancy index of the original judgments of H.Based on the above analysis, it is easy to verify that the proposed estimation procedures can not only yield the complete additive consistent HFPR but also preserve the hesitancy index of the original incomplete HFPR as much as possible, which illustrate the validity of the obtained results by our estimation procedures.Since the new proposed estimation methods are specially used for incomplete HFPRs, and we find no previous work concentrating on the decision making problems using incomplete HFPRs, it is not easy to carry on comparative illustrations with the decision making methods dealing with incomplete HFPRs. Note that the normalized incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relations can be considered as extensions of incomplete fuzzy preference relations, incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations, incomplete triangular fuzzy preference relations, incomplete trapezoid fuzzy preference relations or others, which is based on the maximum length of the hesitant fuzzy elements in the incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relations. Thus, the proposed estimation procedures for incomplete hesitant fuzzy preference relations are also suitable to deal with incomplete fuzzy preference relations, incomplete interval fuzzy preference relations, incomplete triangular fuzzy preference relations, incomplete trapezoid fuzzy preference relations or others.Group decisions often occur when multiple stakeholders are involved and the final choice has to account for all stakeholders’ input. It is assumed that a GDM problem has a set of alternatives X={x1, x2, …, xn} and a group of decision makers D={d1, d2, …, dm} (whose weight vector is λ=(λ1, λ2, …, λm)Twhich satisfies λt≥0, t=1, 2, …, m, and∑t=1mλt=1). A hierarchical structure of this decision process is constructed with a set of criteria C={C1, C2, …, Cp}. In the hierarchical structure construction, place the goal of the desired problem on the top layer of the hierarchical structure, and the evaluation criterion on the second layer C={C1, C2, …, Cp}, and then the alternatives on the bottom layer X={x1, x2, …, xn}. According to every evaluation criteria or the goal of desired problem, the decision maker dt(t=1, 2, …, m) compares every pair of alternatives (or criteria) with respect to some criteria (or goals) to propose incomplete HFPRsHtk=(hij,tk)v×v(k=0,1,2,…,p). When k=0, one has v=p andHt0=(hij,t0)p×pis an incomplete HFPR obtained by the DM dtthrough the comparisons among criteria with respect to the goal in decision making process. If k=1, 2, …, p, we have v=n andHtk=(hij,tk)n×nis an incomplete HFPR determined by the DM dtthrough the comparisons among alternatives with respect to the criterion ck.An algorithm for the GDM problem with incomplete HFPRs is given and the scheme of the resolution process is shown in Fig. 1.Algorithm 2Step 1: Utilize Definition 4.2 to transform incomplete HFPRsHtk=(hij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,…,m,k=0,1,2,…,p)into the normalized incomplete HFPRsH¯tk=(h¯ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,…,m,k=0,1,2,…,p).Step 2: Estimate missing elements inH¯tk=(h¯ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,…,m,k=0,1,2,…,p)using the known elements through Eqs. (20), (21), and (22), and obtain complete HFPRsH¯˙tk=(h¯˙ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,…,m,k=0,1,2,…,p). If any resulting preference relation contains values falling outside the interval [0,1], and within the interval [−c,1+c], a transformation function f(x)=((x+c)/(1+2c)) is applied to all the possible values for the HFEs to convert the preference relate to a HFPR.Step 3: Use the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging operator (Eq. (16)) to aggregate all individual complete HFPRH¯˙tk=(h¯˙ij,tk)v×v(t=1, 2, …, m, k=0, 1, 2, …, p) into a collective HFPRH¯˙ck=(h¯˙ij,ck)v×v(k=0,1,2,…,p).Step 4: Calculate hesitant fuzzy weights by the following formula:(23)wik=h¯˙i,ckh¯˙1,ck⊕h¯˙2,ck⊕⋯⊕h¯˙v,ckwhere(24)h¯˙i,ck=1vh¯˙i1,ck⊕h¯˙i2,ck⊕⋯⊕h¯˙iv,ckWhen k=0;h¯˙i,c0is the arithmetical mean value of hesitant fuzzy comparison ratios of criterion i to each criterion, andwi0is the hesitant fuzzy weight of the ith criterion, for v=p, i=1, 2, …, p. If k=1, 2, …, p,h¯˙i,ckis the arithmetical mean value of hesitant fuzzy comparison ratios of alternative i to each alternative with respect to criterion k, andwikis the hesitant fuzzy weight of the ith alternative on criterion k, for v=n, i=1, 2, …, n.Step 5: The global hesitant fuzzy weights are calculated as(25)wi=⊕k=1p(wk0⊗wik)where i=1, 2, …, n.Step 6: The global weight values wiof alternatives are represented as HFEs. Utilize Definition 2.5 to calculate the scores S(wi) of the global weight values wi.Step 7: Rank all of the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n) in accordance with the score functions S(wi) (i=1, 2, …, n) and then select the optimal one(s).In this section, we use a real-world example (adapted from Islam et al. [11] and Wang et al. [23,24]) to illustrate the proposed algorithm.It is supposed that a person is interested in investing his money to any one of the four portfolios: bank deposit (BD), debentures (DB), government bonds (GB) and Shares (SH). Out of these portfolios he has to choose only one based upon three criteria: C1: return (Re), C2: risk (Ri) and C3: liquidity (Li). A hierarchy structure of criteria is shown in Fig. 2. To obtain a reasonable decision result, an expert group including three members d1, d2 and d3 (whose weighting vector isλ=0.3,0.2,0.5T) is invited to pairwisely compare all the alternatives with respect to each criterion and compare each pair of criteria with respect to the investment choice. Suppose that the expert dt(t=1,2,3) gives his/her incomplete HFPRsHtk=(hij,tk)v×vfor the three criteria with respect to the investment choice (Ic) and all the alternatives with respect to Re, Ri and Li, which are shown as follows:The procedures used to identify the optimal alternative using the method proposed here are as follows.Step 1: Utilize Definition 4.2 to transform incomplete HFPRsHtk=(hij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,3,k=0,1,2,3) into the normalized incomplete HFPRsH¯tk=(h¯ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,3,k=0,1,2,3). Without loss of generality, in this example, we assume that all of the decision makers are all optimistic (other situations can be studied similarly).Step 2: Estimate missing elements inH¯tk=(h¯ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,3,k=0,1,2,3) using the known elements through Eqs. (20), (21), and (22), and obtain complete HFPRsH¯˙tk=(h¯˙ij,tk)v×v(t=1,2,3,k=0,1,2,3) as follows:AsH¯˙12contains values that fall outside in the interval [0,1], it is necessary to apply the transformation function f(x)=((10x+1)/12) to convert it to a HFPRH¯¨12asAsH¯˙32contains values that fall outside in the interval [0,1], it is necessary to apply the transformation function f(x)=((x+0.2)/1.4) to convert it to a HFPRH¯¨32asAsH¯˙33contains values that fall outside in the interval [0,1], it is necessary to apply the transformation function f(x)=((x+0.3)/1.6) to convert it to a HFPRH¯¨33asStep 3: Use the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging operator (Eq. (16)) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯˙t0=(h¯˙ij,t0)3×3(t=1,2,3) into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c0=(h¯˙ij,c0)3×3asUse Eq. (16) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯˙t1=(h¯˙ij,t1)4×4(t=1,2,3) into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c1=(h¯˙ij,c1)4×4asUse Eq. (16) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯¨12,H¯˙22, andH¯¨32into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c2=(h¯˙ij,c2)4×4asUse Eq. (16) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯˙13,H¯˙23, andH¯¨33into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c3=(h¯˙ij,c3)4×4asStep 4: As given in Table 1, the hesitant fuzzy weights are obtained by utilizing Eq. (23). And the global hesitant fuzzy weights of alternatives are determined from Eq. (25).Step 5: Utilize Definition 2.5 to calculate the scores S(wi) of the global hesitant fuzzy weights of alternatives, as listed in Table 1.Step 6: Rank all of the alternatives in accordance with the score functions S(wi) (i=1,2,3,4) as: DB≻BD≻SH≻GB, and thus the candidate DB becomes the best partner.In this subsection, a comparative study with other hesitant fuzzy decision-making models is conducted to validate the results of the proposed decision-making method and to clarify the advantages of the proposed decision-making method.The analysis includes two classes of other hesitant fuzzy decision-making methods. The first class is comprised of methods that use aggregation operators [25,26,37,43,48]. The second class is comprised of hesitant fuzzy outranking methods [5,6,22,44]. The results of all two classes of methods were compared to the results of the proposed method based on a same illustrative example.Case 1Comparison of the proposed approach to methods that use aggregation operators.We include five methods proposed in previous studies that developed aggregation operators to aggregate the hesitant information [25,26,37,43,48]. The existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators in [25,26,37,43,48] were developed based on the following operations on the HFEs h, h1, and h2 proposed by Xia and Xu [26].(1)hλ=⋃γ∈h{γλ};λh=⋃γ∈h{1−(1−γ)λ};h1⊕h2=⋃γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1+γ2−γ1γ2};h1⊗h2=⋃γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1γ2}.Among the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators in [25,26,37,43,48], the most basic one is the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) operator [26], which is introduced as follows:(26)HFWA(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕i=1nwihi=⋃γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏i=1n1−γiwiwherew=w1,w2,…,wnTis the weight vector of hi(i=1, 2, …, n) withwi∈0,1and∑i=1nwi=1. Especially, ifw=1/n,1/n,…,1/nT, then the HFWA operator reduces to the hesitant fuzzy averaging (HFA) operator:(27)HFA(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕i=1n1nhi=⋃γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏i=1n1−γi1/nTo facilitate a comparison with our Algorithm 2, we consider here the same example used in Section 6.1 with Xia and Xu's method [26], involving the following steps:Step 1: Use the HFWA operator (26) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯˙tk=(h¯˙ij,tk)v×v(k=0,1,t=1,2,3)into the collective complete HFPRsH¯˙ck=(h¯˙ij,ck)v×v(k=0,1). Use the HFWA operator (26) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯¨12,H¯˙22, andH¯¨32into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c2=(h¯˙ij,c2)4×4. Use the HFWA operator (26) to aggregate the constructed complete HFPRsH¯˙13,H¯˙23, andH¯¨33into a collective complete HFPRH¯˙c3=(h¯˙ij,c3)4×4. All of the collective complete HFPRsH¯˙tk=(h¯˙ij,tk)v×v(k=0,1,2,3) are not shown here due to space considerations. Note that the dimensions ofh¯˙ij,ck(k=0,1,2,3) inH¯˙ck=(h¯˙ij,ck)v×v(k=0,1,2,3) are calculated as follows:lh¯˙ij,tk=125,k=0,1,2,3,i,j=1,2,3,4,i≠j.Step 2: Utilize the HFA operator (27) to aggregate all of the preference valuesh¯˙ij,c0(j=1,2,3) in the ith line ofH¯˙c0=(h¯˙ij,c0)3×3and then derive the hesitant fuzzy weighth¯.i,c0(i=1,2,3) of the criterion Ci(i=1,2,3), which are not shown here due to space considerations. The dimensions ofh¯˙i,c0(i=1,2,3) are calculated as:lh¯˙i,c0=15,625. Utilize the HFA operator (27) to aggregate all of the preference valuesh¯˙ij,ck(j=1,2,3,4) in the ith line ofH¯˙ck=(h¯˙ij,ck)4×4(k=1,2,3) and then derive the overall performance valueh¯˙i,ck(i=1,2,3,4) of the alternative xiwith respect to the criterion Ck(k=1,2,3), which are not shown here due to space considerations. The dimensions ofh¯˙i,ck(i=1,2,3,4,k=1,2,3) are calculated as:lh¯˙i,ck=1953125.Step 3: Use Definition 2.5 to calculate the score functionsS(h¯˙i,c0)of the hesitant fuzzy weighth¯˙i,c0and then determine the crisp weightwi=S(h¯˙i,c0)/∑i=13S(h¯˙i,c0). Use the HFWA operator (26) to aggregate the overall performance valueh¯˙i,ck(i=1,2,3) of the alternative xiwith respect to the criterion Ck(k=1,2,3) and then derive the collective overall performance valueh¯˙i,c(i=1,2,3) of the alternative xi, which are not shown here due to space considerations. The dimensions ofh¯˙i,c(i=1,2,3,4) are calculated as:lh¯˙i,c=7.4506×1018.Step 4: According to Definition 2.5, we calculate the score valuesS(h¯˙i,c)(i=1,2,3,4) ofh¯˙i,c(i=1,2,3,4) and then determine the ranking of the alternatives as DB≻SH≻BD≻GB, which is slightly different from the results derived by our Algorithm 2 as the positions of the portfolios BD and SH are changed.A comparison analysis further shows that our method has some desirable advantages over the aggregation operators-based approaches [25,26,37,43,48], which are summarized as follows:(1)According to the above example, if aggregation operators are used, the number of operations and the magnitudes of the results will increase exponentially if more HFEs are involved in the operations, which may increase the complexity of the calculations. The deterioration caused by these complexities may limit the application of hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. In contrast, our method does not increase the dimension of the derived HFE when operating the HFEs and thus can preserve the original decision information as much as possible.The existing hesitant fuzzy decision making methods in [25,26,37,43,48] used the hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators to fuse all of the individual HFPRs into the collective HFPR. It is noticed that such collective HFPR derived by the hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators may not keep the additive consistency. In contrast, our method uses Eq. (16) to fuse all of the individual HFPRs into the collective HFPR. Theorem 3.4 shows that such collective HFPR still keeps the additive consistency. Consistency requires that decision maker (DM)’s judgments yield no contradiction. The lack of consistency in decision making can lead to inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, our method not only produces reasonable and credible results but also requires only simple computation procedures. This can prevent loss of data and distortion of the preference information initially provided, resulting in final outcomes that more closely correspond to those in actual decision-making processes.The aggregation operators-based approaches [25,26,37,43,48] can handle decision making problems in which HFEs are used to express the performance ratings and crisp numbers are used to express the criteria weights, but they fail to accommodate criteria weights in the form of HFEs. By contrast, our method can handle decision making problems in which both the evaluation information of alternatives and the criteria weights are expressed by HFEs.It is noted that the aggregation operators-based approaches [25,26,37,43,48] are useful for the small number of criteria in a decision making problem due to the simple solving steps involved. But with the increase of the number of criteria, which is a more general case in the actual MCDM problems, the number of operations and the magnitudes of the results will increase exponentially. In such cases, the aggregation operators-based approaches might become inappropriate because of the requirement for huge computation. In contrast, our Algorithm 2 is preferring to be used to handle the decision making problems with a large set of criteria as it is not only logically simple but also substantially reduces computational efforts.Comparison of the proposed approach to hesitant fuzzy outranking methods.The existing hesitant fuzzy outranking methods include the hesitant fuzzy QUALIFLEX (HF-QUALIFLEX) approach [44], the hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE I (HF-ELECTRE I) [6] method, the hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE II (HF-ELECTRE II) approach [5] and the hesitant fuzzy ELECTRE III (HF-ELECTRE III) approach [22]. Next, these four outranking methods are used to determine the final ranking order of all the alternatives. The results of these methods and the proposed method are listed in Table 2.From Table 2, all of the approaches give the priority to the portfolio DB and the results of the proposed approach are consistent with the results of the HF-QUALIFLEX approach, which verify the reliability and accuracy of the developed method. According to the HF-ELECTRE III [22] method, the preference relations among BD, SH and GB cannot be discerned. In other words, for this investment selection problem we cannot utilize the HF-ELECTRE III [22] method to determine the ranking orders of three potential portfolios.The following comparison analysis shows that our method has many advantages against the existing hesitant fuzzy outranking methods.(1)The proposed method in this study and the HF-QUALIFLEX approach both used HFEs to express the performance ratings of alternatives on each criterion and the weights of criteria, while the HF-ELECTRE I, II and III methods use HFEs to express performance ratings and crisp numbers to express the criteria weights, and they fail to handle the MCDM problems in which both the assessments of alternatives on criteria and the weights of criteria are expressed by HFEs.The HF-ELECTRE I, II and III methods are the preferred methods for MCDM problems with a large set of alternatives and few criteria [44]. For the decision making problems where the number of criteria markedly exceeds the number of alternatives, the use of HF-ELECTRE I, II and III methods make the decision making process very complex and may fail to yield the distinct ranking results of the alternatives [44]. The HF-QUALIFLEX approach is suitable to deal with the decision making problems where the number of criteria markedly exceeds the number of alternatives [44]. But in the HF-QUALIFLEX approach, the number of permutations increases tremendously with the number of alternatives, which results in the tedious computations required for handling the decision making problems with a sufficiently large number of alternatives [44]. In contrast to the HF-QUALIFLEX approach, the HF-ELECTRE I, II and III methods, the proposed method in this study can overcome such drawbacks and is preferring to be used to solve the MCDM problems with a sufficiently large number of alternatives and criteria.

In the process of decision making, a decision maker may give her/his judgments by means of HFPRs, which are suitable to simulate hesitancy associated with impression or vagueness. This paper has focused on the consistency analysis of HFPRs and the estimation of missing elements of the acceptable incomplete HFPRs. First, a definition of additive consistent HFPRs has been proposed and their characterizations have been investigated in detail. Next, we have introduced the concepts of various HFPRs such as incomplete HFPRs, additive consistent incomplete HFPRs, and acceptable incomplete HFPRs. We have developed a simple and practical algorithm, which utilizes the acceptable incomplete HFPR with the lowest number, (n–1), of judgments to construct an additive consistent complete HFPR. The prominent characteristics of the developed method is that it needs the lowest number of judgments provided by the decision maker to construct an additive consistent complete HFPR, and thus, it can not only relieve the decision maker of time pressure but also avoid checking the additive consistency of HFPR. Subsequently, another method is developed to estimate missing elements of the acceptable incomplete HFPR with more known judgments where missing elements are determined by the sequences of known valuesh¯ij1,h¯j1j2,…,h¯jti. Finally, a new algorithm for solving the multi-criteria GDM problem with acceptable incomplete HFPRs has been shown and its practicality and effectiveness has been verified by an illustrative example.In the future, we will apply the proposed approaches to other group decision making problems such as supplier selection [4], e-business [13], and so on.
