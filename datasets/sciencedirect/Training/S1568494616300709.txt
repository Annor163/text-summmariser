@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents Fuzzy and Ant Colony Optimization Based Combined MAC, Routing, and Unequal Clustering Cross-Layer Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (FAMACROW) consisting of several nodes that send sensed data to a Master Station. FAMACROW incorporates cluster head selection, clustering, and inter-cluster routing protocols. FAMACROW uses fuzzy logic with residual energy, number of neighboring nodes, and quality of communication link as input variables for cluster head selection. To avoid hot spots problem, FAMACROW uses an unequal clustering mechanism with clusters closer to MS having smaller sizes than those far from it. FAMACROW uses Ant Colony Optimization based technique for reliable and energy-efficient inter-cluster multi-hop routing from cluster heads to MS. The inter-cluster routing protocol decides relay node considering its: (i) distance from current cluster head and that from MS (for energy-efficient inter-cluster communication), (ii) residual energy (for energy distribution across the network), (iii) queue length (for congestion control), (iv) delivery likelihood (for reliable communication). A comparative analysis of FAMACROW with Unequal Cluster Based Routing [33], Unequal Layered Clustering Approach [43], Energy Aware Unequal Clustering using Fuzzy logic [37] and Improved Fuzzy Unequal Clustering [35] shows that FAMACROW is 41% more energy-efficient, has 75–88% more network lifetime and sends 82% more packets compared to Improved Fuzzy Unequal Clustering protocol.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been focus of research since they expand human capability to observe and interact remotely with the physical world [1–3]. A typical WSN consist of nodes distributed across the sensing area without any fixed infrastructure. These nodes collect sensed data and transmit it to the Master Station (MS). The nodes are constrained in energy, storage, and computational resources [4,5]. Further, the nodes are deployed in hostile environments, where they may die due to deficiency of power, get physically damaged, or may encounter severe environmental interference. This requires the WSN protocols to be simple, energy-efficient, and adapt to varying environmental conditions.Energy efficiency can be achieved by using cross-layer approaches that exploit interaction among the communication layers for decision making [6]. With protocol design using cross-layer approach, information at a layer can be used to the benefit of protocols at other layer. For example, information of strength of signal received from a neighboring node (physical layer information) can assist routing protocols (at network layer) to decide next hop in the route (if signal is weak, node is far and hence should not be used as next hop candidate in routing). It can also assist data link layer protocols in link adaptive or hybrid Forward Error Correction (FEC)/Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) schemes [7]. Use of computational intelligence techniques in protocol design facilitates intelligent behavior in complex and varying environments [8]. Computational intelligence paradigms like: neural networks, reinforcement learning, swarm intelligence, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic, and artificial immune systems have been successfully used to address WSN issues like: cluster head selection, routing, data aggregation, security, and localization [9–11].This paper proposes FAMACROW, a cross-layer protocol that combines energy-efficient hierarchical cluster routing and media access. It uses a fuzzy based cluster head selection technique for selecting nodes with high residually energy, having more number of neighboring nodes, and high quality of communication link as cluster heads. One of the issues of hierarchical clustering is hot spots problem in which cluster heads near MS are heavily loaded with traffic consisting of their own sensor data packets; relay packets from distant cluster heads (inter-cluster traffic); and sensor data packets from its own cluster members (intra-cluster traffic). This makes cluster heads near MS die earlier than those far from MS leading to severe network connectivity and coverage issues in the region near the MS [12]. To address this problem, FAMACROW organizes the network into clusters of unequal sizes with clusters closer to MS having smaller sizes than those far from it. With a smaller cluster size, cluster heads near MS will have less amount of intra-cluster traffic which in turn preserves their energy for relay traffic. Finally, for reliable and energy-efficient data transfer to MS, FAMACROW uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based technique for inter-cluster multi-hop routing from cluster heads to MS. It selects relay cluster head based on: its distance from current cluster head and that from MS (for energy-efficient inter-cluster communication); residual energy (for energy distribution across the network); queue length (for congestion control) and delivery probability (for reliable communication). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work. FAMACROW operation is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 provides comparative analysis of FAMACROW with four well referred protocols of similar complexity. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.
