Quantification and solutions of arm movements effect on sEMG pattern recognition

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Arm movements, especially the dynamic change of arm position, have adverse effect on surface electromyography pattern recognition of wrist or hand motions, which results in very high classification errors.We adopted three metrics to quantify the changes of characteristics in the feature space due to arm movements.Arm movements caused the deviation of class centroid and made the intra-class dispersion greater.A robust training scheme was used to eliminate this effect and a novel classifier, conditional Gaussian mixture model, was proposed to improve the classification performance under this training scheme.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Robust pattern recognition is critical for myoelectric prosthesis developed in the laboratory to be used in real life. This study focused on the effect of arm movements on surface electromyography (sEMG) pattern recognition for 7 kinds of hand and wrist motions. An experiment was conducted with four static arm conditions and three dynamic arm conditions. Results showed that the arm movements impacted classification performance when the classifier, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was trained in one arm condition and tested in another arm condition. Inter-condition classification errors (training data and testing data are from different arm conditions) were greater than intra-condition classification errors (training data and testing data are from the same arm condition; average 20.98% vs. 5.26%). Three metrics – repeatability index (RI), mean semi-principal axis (MSA) and mean centroid bias (MCB) – were used to quantify changes in sEMG pattern characteristics of hand and wrist motions. A multi-condition training scheme was explored to improve the robustness of sEMG pattern recognition for hand and wrist motions by reducing the average classification error from 18.73% (LDA trained in single-condition) to 8.20% (LDA trained in multi-condition). Furthermore, a novel classifier, conditional Gaussian mixture model (CGMM) was proposed under this training scheme and yielded a lower classification error than LDA (average 5.92% vs. 8.20%, p=0.0078).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been used for prosthetic device research for over six decades [1]. Control scheme for myoelectric prostheses can generally be categorized into two groups [2]: non-pattern recognition and pattern recognition based. The former group was developed earlier and had been implemented in clinical application. This scheme used the amplitude of sEMG signals from a pair of muscles to control one degree of freedom (DOF) of prehension. If more DOFs were expected, the users needed to perform co-contraction to switch mode. This made the control non-intuitive and cumbersome. So myoelectric prostheses based on this traditional scheme have been typically limited to one or two DOFs [3,4].It has been proved that the scheme based on pattern recognition might address this limitation and has potential to control multi-functional prostheses [5]. The basic strategy is: when the user performs a natural contraction corresponding to a motion class, a classifier which has been trained is used to recognize the EMG pattern of this contraction, and then the prosthetic hand is activated in an analogous way. This scheme is more intuitive and can control more DOFs movements, therefore, a large number of studies have been carried out to apply this methodology for prosthesis use. These efforts came to fruition by applying many algorithms to extract useful sEMG features (such as time domain features [5,6], time–frequency representation [7,8], nonlinear analysis [9,10] and high order statistics [11]) and design effective classifiers (such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [12], artificial neural networks [13,14], Gaussian mixture model [15], heuristic fuzzy logic approach [16] and support vector machine [17]). High recognition accuracy (i.e. above 90%) with classified task containing more than six motion classes has been attained via these algorithms. Furthermore, several studies have carried out real time experiments to examine the possibility of practical application of pattern-recognition-based prostheses (PRBP), often with amputee subjects. In Ref. [18] six channel sEMG signals were applied to direct a physical prosthesis to perform six types of motions and the real-time classification rate was about 85%. In Ref. [19] six channel sEMG signals were employed to control a 3-DOF prosthetic virtual prosthesis for accomplishing the target achievement control (TAC) test and the completion rate was about 90%. However, most experiments in these studies were implemented in laboratories under ideal conditions.Many factors may influence the reliability of PRBP in practical use even though the PRBP demonstrates high recognition rates (above 90%) in the laboratory. One factor is whether the pattern recognition system can maintain satisfactory performance in everyday settings. Many cases could reduce the recognition rate of PRBP such as extended use, the change of load, and arm position change when performing a task. Recently, some research has been conducted to resolve the issue of applying the PRBP in a clinical setting. Tkach et al. [20] studied the stability of time-domain features in three conditions: changing electrode location, variability of muscle contraction effort and muscle fatigue. In their study the most stable feature set could obtain accuracies of 72.6–85.6% for classification of four types of motions. Simon et al. [21] proposed a decision-based velocity ramp for minimizing the effect of misclassification to improve the controllability of PRBP. The completion rate significantly increased from 85% to 95% in a real-time test. Young and Hargrove et al. [22,23] tried to eliminate the influence of the electrode shift by an advanced training strategy, changing inter-electrode distance and electrode configuration. They achieved the improvement of accuracy from 88% to 94% for classifying 9 types of motions.The limb position effect in myoelectric pattern recognition has been studied by Fougher et al. [24]. They investigated a problem that involved five static arm positions and attempted to solve this problem by combining training data from multi-positions, using accelerometers to record arm positions. Further, Geng et al. [25] extended this work by extending the experiment in transradial amputees, where five static arm positions were considered. These studies gave promising initial results. However, they only discussed some static positions and did not consider dynamic movements when the arm is moving between positions. It is evident that the dynamic movements may bring new problems. In the practical application, the prosthetic hand is controlled in most conditions that the arm is moving. Moreover, lots of previous research [6,15,17,22–24] about myoelectric control was results-oriented. They concentrated on the performance measures without looking into the characteristics of underlying feature space. This may make the explanation of the results insufficient [26] and the methods used less dependable.Extending our previous work [27], in this paper we try to adopt mathematical tools to quantify the influence of arm movements on sEMG pattern characteristics of hand and wrist motions in the feature space. We conducted an experiment in which the subject performed hand and wrist motions in four static arm conditions and three dynamic conditions with the subject moving his arm in one direction. The arm movements significantly compromised the performance of classification wrist and hand motions. Three metrics – repeatability index (RI), mean semi-principal axis (MSA) and mean centroid bias (MCB) – which were inspired from work in Ref. [28], were adopted to accomplish the quantifying analysis. In addition, two solutions were proposed to alleviate the effect of arm movements on sEMG pattern recognition. The first one, a multi-condition training scheme was explored to improve robustness of sEMG pattern recognition for hand and wrist motions to arm movements. The second one, under the multi-condition training scheme, a novel classifier – conditional Gaussian mixture model (CGMM) – was proposed. The multi-condition CGMM achieved a significantly lower classification error than the multi-condition LDA (average 5.92% vs. 8.20%, p=0.0078).
