@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article presents a new approach for constructing connected operators for image processing and analysis. It relies on a hierarchical Markovian unsupervised algorithm in order to classify the nodes of the traditional Max-Tree. This approach enables to naturally handle multivariate attributes in a robust non-local way. The technique is demonstrated on several image analysis tasks: filtering, segmentation, and source detection, on astronomical and biomedical images. The obtained results show that the method is competitive despite its general formulation. This article provides also a new insight in the field of hierarchical Markovian image processing showing that morphological trees can advantageously replace traditional quadtrees.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In image processing, connected operators are morphological operators that concentrate on the non deformation of edges. In binary images, as their name suggests, their very principle is to work on the connected components of an image, and the only allowed operation is the removal of such components. Connected operators take their roots in the notion of filters by reconstruction [1,2]. They have been studied in the context of binary image processing in [3,4] and their extension to gray-scale images appeared in [5–8]. In this case, we say that an operator is connected if it is connected at all thresholding levels of the image.Gray-scale connected operators started to become popular when a powerful framework and an efficient algorithm were proposed in order to compute connected operators by Salembier et al. [9]. This framework relies on a hierarchical representation of the image called the Max-Tree (also commonly known as the (connected) component tree). This representation is a tree where each node corresponds to a connected component of a threshold of the image and the parent relation is given by the inclusion relation among the connected components. This representation can then be used in the following 4-steps process (see Fig. 1) to define connected operators: (1) compute the Max-Tree of the image, (2) equip each node of the tree with some relevant attributes (area, compactness, moments, entropy, …), (3) select nodes in the tree according to their attribute values, and finally (4) reconstruct an image from the filtered tree. The last reconstruction step consists in assigning a new value to each pixel of the image using the content of the nodes selected during the previous step. Connected operators have since been applied to various types of images: document images [10–12], biomedical imaging [13–16], remote sensing [17,18], or astronomical imaging [19,20]. Although the primary aim of connected operators was to perform image filtering [9], they have now been implied in various image analysis tasks such as segmentation [8,21,22], retrieval [23], classification [24] or registration [25].It is also noteworthy that several connected operators (morphological reconstruction, flooding, region growing, …) can be formulated in the framework of the Image Foresting Transform (IFT) [26]. The IFT relies on an efficient and versatile formulation based on the classical shortest path problem and provides a unified framework for a wide variety of image operators. On the other hand it has also been observed that connected operators share deep links with the TV-L1 optimization scheme [27].
