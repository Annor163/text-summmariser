@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase found in all eukaryotes that was one of the first kinases to be identified and studied. GSK-3 was initially named for its ability to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase, a key regulatory process in the glycogen synthesis [1–3]. GSK-3 exists as two closely related isoforms, alpha (51kDa) and beta (47kDa), which are expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues encoded by separate genes. The proteins share 97% sequence similarity within their kinase catalytic domains, but differ significantly from one another outside this region, with GSK-3 alpha possessing an extended N-terminal glycine-rich tail [4].Beyond its role in glycogen metabolism GSK-3 phosphorylates, it regulates the functions of many metabolic, signaling, and structural proteins. Initially recognized as the modulator of glycogen metabolism, GSK-3 is now consequently implicated to play an important regulatory role in many different pathways including the initiation of protein synthesis, tumorigenesis, cell survival, apoptosis, and is essential for embryonic development as a component of the Wnt signaling cascade. GSK-3 can be considered as a target for both metabolic and neurological disorders [5,6]. GSK-3 is constitutively active in resting cells and is inhibited by several hormones such as insulin, endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Insulin has been demonstrated to cause the inactivation of GSK-3. The mechanism of inactivation is associated with the phosphorylation of the specific serine residues Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3 isoforms α and β, respectively, but does not cause the accumulation of β-catenin. GSK-3 has a very important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and possible involvement in the development of insulin resistance in type II diabetes [7]. So, GSK-3 is an attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as promising new antidiabetic drugs [8]. GSK-3 inhibitors are classified into three types: ATP competitive inhibitors, non-ATP competitive inhibitors, and metal ion competitive inhibitors (in Mg2+ binding site) [9]. Many research works focus on the structural requirements of GSK-3 inhibitors. Maleimide derivates appear to be among the most selective ATP competitive GSK-3 inhibitors identified so far [10–19].Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods are widely used in modern drug design and discovery because of the early prediction of activity-related characteristics of drug candidates and the possibility to eliminate molecules with undesired properties [20–22]. The main aim of all QSAR modeling is to develop a simple mathematical equation that correlates a molecule׳s studied biological activity with its properties derived as quantitative parameters entitled as descriptors. Therefore, descriptors can be defined as entities that characterize specific information of the studied molecule in terms that they are numerical values associated with the chemical constitution for correlation of chemical structure with biological activity. The developed equation should provide insights into the essential structural requisites of the molecule which contribute to biological activity. Depending on the computational determination, descriptors can be classified as physico-chemical (hydrophobic, steric, or electronic), topological, electronic (molecular orbit calculations), geometric, structural (frequency of occurrence of a substructure) or simple indicator parameter. Furthermore, molecular descriptors can be classified in two major groups – substituent constants and whole molecular descriptors. Also, descriptors can be classified according to dimensions [23]. QSAR models based on geometry-dependent molecular descriptors usually have a relatively difficult calculation of the optimum molecular geometry, high computational costs and long computational calculation time. For these reasons, the conformation-independent (0D, 1D and 2D-QSPR) method models based on the constitutional and topological molecular features of compounds emerged as an alternative approach [24,25]. QSAR modeling is often based on optimal descriptors calculated with the molecular graph [26–28]. The simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) can be considered as an alternative for the representation of the molecular structure by the molecular graph [29–31]. A SMILES notation based optimal descriptor is a molecular descriptor which depends both on the molecular structure and the property under analysis, but does not explicitly depend on details from the 3D-molecular geometry. The development of QSAR models, where the SMILES is the representation of the molecular structure and is used for developing optimal descriptors, is an attractive direction of research work in the field of the QSAR theory and applications [32–34]. Previous QSPR/QSAR studies have shown the importance of this methodology, which was capable of developing models with a comparable or sometimes better quality to the ones built with descriptors in a pool containing thousands of 0D–3D descriptors [35–42].The aim of this study is to build a QSAR model based on the SMILES notation optimal descriptors using the Monte Carlo method for both 3-anilino-4-arylmaleimide derivatives and maleimide derivatives as glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors and an attempt to define the molecular fragments responsible for the stated inhibitory effect. Further, we used the build model and defined molecular fragments for the computer aided drug design of new potentially promising glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitors.
