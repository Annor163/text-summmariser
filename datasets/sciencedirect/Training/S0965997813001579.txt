@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The maintenance management plays an important role in the monitoring of business activities. It ensures a certain level of services in industrial systems by improving the ability to function in accordance with prescribed procedures. This has a decisive impact on the performance of these systems in terms of operational efficiency, reliability and associated intervention costs. To support the maintenance processes of a wide range of industrial services, a knowledge-based component is useful to perform the intelligent monitoring. In this context we propose a generic model for supporting and generating industrial lights maintenance processes. The modeled intelligent approach involves information structuring and knowledge sharing in the industrial setting and the implementation of specialized maintenance management software in the target information system. As a first step we defined computerized procedures from the conceptual structure of industrial data to ensure their interoperability and effective use of information and communication technologies in the software dedicated to the management of maintenance (E-candela). The second step is the implementation of this software architecture with specification of business rules, especially by organizing taxonomical information of the lighting systems, and applying intelligence-based operations and analysis to capitalize knowledge from maintenance experiences. Finally, the third step is the deployment of the software with contextual adaptation of the user interface to allow the management of operations, editions of the balance sheets and real-time location obtained through geolocation data. In practice, these computational intelligence-based modes of reasoning involve an engineering framework that facilitates the continuous improvement of a comprehensive maintenance regime.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A French Engineering/Construction company spent a maintenance contract with Pulp and paper manufacturer, manufacturing paper sheets in a commune of the Haute-Garonne department in southwestern France. The contractual objective was to maintain at least 80% of the lighting places in operating condition, which means managing 15,000 spotlights. Disturbances in the light management system have severe impacts on company critical functions and its critical infrastructures. Hence, there is a need for an approach to intelligent maintenance analyses, which assists maintenance analysis of outages in the light management system and enables investigation of cascading failures and consequences in other infrastructures [19]. An important defy associated with the systemic view may be to create major scenarios for the analysis of interdependencies within critical infrastructures [5]. The engagement of an interoperability approach assessing the dependencies among sub-areas demonstrates a valuable benefit in terms of resilience analysis [4]. In addition, the access to information and shared operating experience can exist with obtainable cross-fertilizations between safety and security engineering tools and methodologies [26].Maintenance management information systems are indispensable to ensure control, gain knowledge and improve decision making [8]. The first step was to define the computerized procedures from conceptual structure of (formatting data that is calculated before in the Excel spread sheet) industrial data to ensure their good use, dedicated to the software maintenance management (E-candela). The second step was the setting, adapting the interface and implementation of the database of the software to allow contextual adaptation. And finally, the third step was to use the software, management of operations, editions of the balance sheets and geolocation. So, the software maintenance management employs contextual characterizations of situations to provide more relevant services or information to support users performing their tasks [31]. Likewise, it is possible to employ text mining approaches to classify material or immaterial resources into various categories based upon their geospatial features, with the aims to discovering relationships between resources and geographical zones [22]. Such method can detect real-time and geospatial event features for awareness of large-scale events and risk management [23] with pervasive computing for continuous location and resources monitoring [29].
