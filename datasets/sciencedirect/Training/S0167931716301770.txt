@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
III-Nitride high-aspect ratio nanostructures such as arrays of ordered nanorods and nanopores, for which the lateral dimensions of pillars and holes, respectively, are submicron and the aspect ratio is greater than one, are of great interest for the next generation of devices such as core-shell light emitting diodes [1–3], non-linear photonic diodes [4], photonic crystal emitters [5–7] and sensors [8–11]. It has been reported that the optical emission properties of InGaN/GaN nanorod arrays, such as the directivity or the enhancement of photonic crystal features, strongly depends on the shape, diameter, height and density of the nanorod arrays [6,7,12]. The use of nanopore arrays to create photonic crystals within suspended membranes also depends on the losses induced by scattering induced by the fabrication process [13,14]. Therefore, the ability to accurately control the nanorod and nanopore parameters is essential for device fabrication.The use of deep-ultraviolet or nanoimprint lithography (NIL) to create nanoscale metal mask, combined with dry-etching, allows the creation of arrays of nanorods and nanopores on a wafer-scale through top-down processing [15,16]. The nanostructure diameter, dimension and geometry of the array can be controlled by carefully designing the stamp, whilst the height and shape of the nanostructures can be tuned by controlling the parameters of the dry-etching process [16]. The nanorod profile plays an important role in whether photonic crystal effects are observed in InGaN/GaN nanorods. The introduction of an undercut profile creates a strong index guiding which supports the formation of Bloch modes [6], allowing the light to be guided in-plane and causing the existence of a photonic band gap.The use of an epitaxial regrowth step after the etching of the nanostructure by Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) can also be implemented to reduce etch damage induced by the top-down process [17]. Furthermore, it can be used to create an active region, such as an InGaN quantum well, for the fabrication of InGaN/GaN radial core shell structures for LEDs [17–19] or sensors [8–10].In our previous study, we found the temperature during plasma etching had a critical effect on the sidewall verticality of high-aspect-ratio GaN nanorods [20]. In this article, we examine more deeply the impact of temperature and pressure on the shape of the GaN nanorods and nanopores using Cl2/Ar chemistry. This chemistry was chosen for its simplicity and because it produces controllable etch rates [21]. Using an etch temperature greater than 125°C has been found to enable the formation of high-aspect-ratio nanorods with a vertical profile, and both the pressure and temperature are critical parameters for the fabrication of undercut nanorods and nanopores.A nanoimprint-lithography-based lift-off technique was used to create regular hexagonal arrays of metal dots or holes for use as a hard mask for nanorods and nanopores respectively [15]. The nanoimprint masters comprised either 230nm features on a 600nm pitch or 600nm features on a 2μm pitch. Fig. 1shows an example of the nanoscale metal mask used for GaN etching with a pitch of 600nm. The size of the metal dots in Fig. 1a was measured to be approximately 280nm whilst the size of the holes in the metal mask in Fig. 1b was approximately 250nm.Conventional MOVPE-grown, Ga-polar, c-plane, silicon-doped GaN-on-sapphire templates of thickness approximately 5μm were used for creating both GaN nanorods and nanopores in an ICP dry etch system (Oxford Instruments System 100 Cobra). A mixed Cl2/Ar gas composition with a 5:1 ratio was used for the GaN etching. This composition represents a good compromise between a fast GaN etching rate and reduced mask erosion, both of which are important for obtaining high-aspect-ratio structures. The following dry etching parameters for nanorod and nanopore etching were kept constant: Cl2 flow 50sccm, Ar flow 10sccm, RIE power 120W, ICP source power 800W. The pressure was varied between 9mTorr and 15mTorr, and the temperature was varied between 75°C to 175°C for nanorods, and 150°C to 350°C for nanopores. Higher temperatures were studied for the nanopores in order to determine whether the etch limitations, to be discussed later, could be overcome. The effect of etch duration was investigated from 5 to 30min at the different pressures and temperatures for both structures. The temperature of the bottom electrode, on which the sample was placed, was controlled and measured in-situ. The variation of measured temperature never exceeded the set temperature by more than 5°C during the overall etching process. In order to minimize additional plasma heating of the sample, a pause of one minute was introduced after each minute of etching. Secondary electron images were taken from the centre of the sample with a Hitachi S-4300 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) after cleaving it in half. The height and diameter of the nanostructure were extracted from the SEM image. Measurements were taken on more than five nanostructures to obtain representative and accurate dimensions.
