@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper clarifies the relation between decisions of a risk-averse decision maker, based on expected utility theory on the one hand, and spectral risk measures on the other.We first demonstrate that recent approaches to this problem generally do not provide strongly consistent results, i.e. they fail to induce identical preference orders simultaneously with both concepts. Then we detail the relation between risk-averse decisions under the dual theory of choice and spectral risk measures. This relation is identified as the fundamental reason why it is not in general possible to establish a simple one-to-one mapping between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.We are nonetheless able to use spectral risk measures to model decisions obtained using expected utility theory. Interestingly, this implies that a given utility function corresponds to a whole family of risk spectra.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The introduction of the concept of coherent risk measures in the financial literature (Artzner et al., 1997; Artzner et al., 1999) was a milestone in constructing risk measures, which are feasible both from an academic and a practitioners point of view, to overcome the well known shortcomings of Value-at-Risk (Jorion, 2006; Vozian, 2010; Krause, 2003). Among the possible classes of coherent risk measures, the class of spectral risk measures introduced by Acerbi (Acerbi, 2002; Acerbi, 2004), whose most prominent member is the Expected Shortfall (Tasche, 2002; Acerbi and Tasche, 2002; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2002), has attracted considerable attention in the financial literature. Its general properties (Acerbi, 2002; Acerbi, 2004; Acerbi, 2007; Cherny, 2006; Dowd et al., 2008), estimation procedures (Acerbi, 2002; Giannopoulos and Tunaru, 2005; Cotter and Dowd, 2006; Cotter and Dowd, 2007a; Cotter and Dowd, 2007b) and its versatility in portfolio optimization (Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2000; Acerbi and Simonetti, in press; Adam et al., 2008; Strepparava, 2009; Deng et al., 2009; Brandtner, in press) have been studied extensively. In the context of portfolio optimization, the question of how to incorporate spectral risk measures into the framework of established theories of choice, is a particularly interesting and important one. This paper focuses on the problem of modeling rational behavior of a risk-averse decision maker, using spectral risk measures. For the dual theory of choice (Yaari, 1986; Yaari, 1987), this was already accomplished by Wang (1996), Wang (2000), Denuit et al. (2006), Gzyl and Mayoral (2006), using the equivalence of spectral risk measures and distortion risk measures. Recent research (Sriboonchitta et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2009; Dowd et al., 2008) tried to construct a similar connection between the classical theory of expected utility (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947; Föllmer and Schied, 2002) and spectral risk measures. Different approaches to this problem were proposed, but failed so far to provide a consistent theoretical framework.This papers provides a conclusive answer to that question by elaborating a scheme, to consistently model the behavior of an expected-utility-maximizer within the class of spectral risk measures. Furthermore, the earlier approaches (Sriboonchitta et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2009; Dowd et al., 2008) and the connection to the dual theory of choice are discussed to provide a complete and self-contained picture. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces spectral risk measures and their general relation to decision theories. Section 3 provides a brief review of recent attempts to establish a link between spectral risk measures and expected utility theory. Section 4 details the process and the implications of modeling risk averse behavior with spectral risk measures under the dual theory of choice. In Section 5, we provide a method for linking spectral risk measures and expected utility theory with the help of an auxiliary probability measure. This method is a close relative to the idea of changing probability measures in derivative pricing. We extend this approach to a general procedure in Section 6, and provide sufficient conditions for the link to be well defined and unique. We summarize and discuss our findings in Section 7.SupposeL0(Ω,F,P)to be the space of all measurable, real-valued functions (i.e. random variables) on some probability space(Ω,F,P). Further, suppose the profit and loss (P&L) of a financial position to be determined at some future time T by the state of the world at that time, and to be fully described by some random variableX∈L0(Ω,F,P)or its cumulative distribution function (P&L-distribution) FX(x) today. In the following FX(x) is assumed to be monotonically increasing such that its quantile functionqX(p)≔FX-1(p)exists.The functionalsρ:L0(Ω,F,P)→Rare denoted as risk measures for the P&L-distributions, their subset(1)ρφ(X)≔-∫01φ(p)FX-1(p)dp=-∫01φ(p)qX(p)dpof functionals being defined by any functionφ:[0,1]→R, with the properties(2a)φ(p)⩾0(positivity),(2b)∫01φ(p)dp=1(normalization),and(2c)φ(p1)⩾φ(p2)(monotonicity),foranyp1⩽p2defines the set of spectral risk measures (cf. Acerbi, 2002; Acerbi, 2004; Tasche, 2002). The weighting function φ is also called the risk spectrum.Now consider financial positions X and Y with P&L-distributions as introduced above, and further assume a decision maker with preference relations described by a functionalU:L0(Ω,F,P)→Rin the sense that:(3)XispreferredoverY⇔U(X)>U(Y)holds for arbitrary X, Y (cf. Puppe, 1991; Föllmer and Schied, 2002). A given theory of choice, describing a decision maker by some representation U, as introduced above, is now said to be consistently related to spectral risk measures ρφ, if U and φ can be mapped on each other such that(4)ρφ(X)⩽ρφ(Y)⇔U(X)⩾U(Y)holds for allX,Y∈L0(Ω,F,P). This relationship implies that the rational behavior of a decision maker, described by the theory of choice at hand, can be modeled by spectral risk measures. In particular, the key concept of risk aversion can then be operationalized consistently within the framework of spectral risk measures.At this point one might ask, why should one be interested in modeling rational behavior with spectral risk measures? The answer is strongly related to a critical property of expected utility theory, namely risk preferences are strictly associated to the utility function, independent of the respective P&L-distribution. On the other hand, risk is a concept closely related to uncertainty, and hence to the P&L-distribution. Thus, modeling rational behavior with spectral risk measures is the attempt to map the pure risk preference of a decision maker. If there is a unique connection in the sense of (4) between SRMs and expected utility theory, it might be possible to separate risk and utility preferences after all.Define the shorthand notation Eu[X]≔E[u(X)] to indicate the expectation value of an arbitrary utility function with respect to the P&L-distribution of X. Expected utility theory assumes a particular representation of the preference relation (3), namely(5)U(X)=∫-∞∞u(x)dFX(x)=Eu[X]with a utility function u, mapping onto the real numbers (cf. Föllmer and Schied, 2002). To represent a risk averse decision maker, u′>0 and u″⩽0 (concave u) are assumed, which allow for the definition of a simple local measure of risk aversion(6)rPA=-u″/u′,known as the Pratt-Arrow-coefficient (Pratt, 1964; Arrow, 1971).Several recent research papers deal with a relationship between spectral measures of risk and expected utility theory. The works of Dowd et al. (2008) and Tao et al. (2009) consider particular types of utility functions and simply translate them into risk spectra of a corresponding functional form. Dowd et al. (2008) conclude correctly that this ad hoc assignment of a risk spectrum, with respect to a given utility function, can lead to inconsistent results. Unfortunately, they attribute these problems to the general properties of spectral risk measures. We will show that these inconsistencies arise because of an inappropriate construction of the link between the utility function and the risk spectrum and not for more fundamental reasons. An arbitrary choice of such functions and subsequent interpretation of their parameters cannot be expected to yield consistent results.In a recent publication Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) develop a calculation scheme for the systematic construction of a risk spectrum φ from a given utility function u. They define the buying price pB(X) of a random future P&L X, according to expected utility theory, such that Eu(X−pB)=0 holds. Using results from robust statistics (e.g. Huber, 1981), they subsequently derive a scheme to construct a risk spectrum φ from a given utility function u, such that(7)ρφ(X)=-pB(X)holds. This identification is the central hypothesis of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010). The procedure is exercised only in the trivial case of a linear utility function u(x)=x, in which case φ(p)=1 follows immediately. This leads to the fully consistent result ρφ(X)=−E[X]=−pB. The non-trivial case of the exponential utility function u(x)=1−e−kxwith arbitrary k>0 was considered too involved for a direct computation by the authors. We provide this calculation in Appendix A. Based on this result, a closer investigation of the central hypothesis (7) reveals inconsistencies on a very fundamental level.Consider the exponential utility function u(x) and the random variables X1∼U(a, b) and X2∼N(μ, σ). The buying price pB(X1) is(8)pB(X1)=-lne-ka-e-kbb-a.The buying price pB(X2) can be calculated by solving(9)Eu[X2-pB]=∫-∞∞1-e-k(x-pB)2πσ2e-12x-μσ2dx=1-exp-k(μ-pB)+k2σ22=0,which yields(10)pB(X2)=μ-k2σ2.In order for hypothesis (7) to be correct, −pB(X1) and −pB(X2) must obey the spectral risk measures axioms (cf. Acerbi, 2004). However, −pB(X1) obviously violates the axiom of positive homogeneity and −pB(X2) violates the axiom of monotonicity. It follows that neither −pB(X1) nor −pB(X2) defines a spectral risk measure (neither are even coherent) and thus hypothesis (7) is violated.Summarizing these results, neither the ad hoc construction of Dowd et al. (2008) and Tao et al. (2009), nor the robust method of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) succeeded in establishing a consistent relationship between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.In this section, we motivate our approach from the somewhat different perspective of the premium principle, originated in the actuarial literature. The premium principle is introduced in Section 4.1 and its application to expected utility theory is shown to support the results of Section 3. In Section 4.2 Yaari’s dual theory of choice (Yaari, 1987) is reviewed and contrasted to expected utility theory. The application of the premium principle to the dual theory of choice serves as vehicle for the consistent modeling of risk aversion with spectral risk measures in Section 4.3.Suppose a preference relation like (3) is represented by a function U. What fee or premium must be received by an insurer in order to make a specific risk, denoted by P&L X, acceptable to take? The premium principle states that the premium to be received has to obey an indifference relation of the kind(11)U(X+π)=U(0),where U(0) indicates the appreciation for the safety equivalent. The risk measure defined by ρ(X)≔π obviously fulfills the relation(12)ρ(X)⩽ρ(Y)⇔U(X)⩾U(Y)forallX,Y∈L0(Ω,F,P).As a first example, consider expected utility theory and its representation U(X)=Eu[X] with utility function u, satisfying u(0)=0. Within this representation, the premium principle (11) reads U(X+π)=Eu[X+π]=0. This so-called “zero-utility premium principle” (cf. Bühlmann, 2005) introduces a risk measure, which is not coherent (Tsanakas and Desli, 2003). To see this, note that the definition of the buying price Eu[X−pB]=0 of Section 3 yields pB=−π, and thus ρ(X)=−pB, which is identical to the hypothesis of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010), Eq. (7).Motivated by empirical and theoretical criticism on the independence-axiom of expected utility theory (Puppe, 1991; Yaari, 1987), alternative decision theories have been derived by modifying this axiom (Puppe, 1991). Of particular importance for the matter at hand is the dual theory of choice, which replaces the original independence-axiom by a dual independence-axiom (DIA).DIA For anyX,Y,Z∈L0(Ω,F,P),x∈Rand λ∈[0,1] holds:X≽Y⇒(λFX⊞(1-λ)FZ)(x)≽(λFY⊞(1-λ)FZ)(x).The operation λF⊞(1−λ)G=(λF−1+(1−λ)G−1)−1 for distribution functions F and G is called the harmonic convex combination by Yaari (1987), and F−1 and G−1 are the generalized inverse functions of F and G. Therefore, the terms in brackets in DIA are the distribution functions of the random variables λX+(1−λ)Z and λY+(1−λ)Z, respectively. Thus, not the independence of the convex combinations of the distributions, but the independence of the convex combinations of the random variables themselves is postulated.The harmonic convex combination has an obvious resemblance to the concept of copulas. And indeed, the dual independence DIA is directly related to the property of comonotonicity, which is a distribution-free analogue of perfect correlation. This is of paramount importance in rational decision making, because comonotonic random variables cannot be used as mutual hedge. This entails further consequences, explored and proved in (Yaari, 1987, Section 3).In the framework of the dual theory of choice, preference relations have the representation(13)U(X)=∫-∞∞xd(h∘FX)(x)=:Eh[X],where Eh[X] is defined as the expectation value of X with respect to a distorted probability distribution h(FX(x)) with some isotonic distortion function h: [0, 1]→[0, 1], obeying h(0)=0 and h(1)=1 (Yaari, 1987; Tsanakas and Desli, 2003). Unlike expected utility theory, which focuses on the expected value of a transformed future P&L of some position, the dual theory of choice considers the expected value of the proper P&L with respect to a transformed distribution, which corresponds to a change of the probability measure.Second-order stochastic dominance or equivalently risk aversion of the decision maker is guaranteed by requiringd2hdp2<0(concave h, cf. Yaari, 1987). Furthermore, an analog to the Pratt-Arrow-coefficient can be defined by(14)rDPA(p)=-d2hdp2/dhdp(Yaari, 1986). Notice that we use a different sign convention and therefore the original results translate from convex to concave and from positive to negative. The conversion is detailed in Appendix B.Now consider the representation U(X)=Eh[X] of the dual theory of choice (13). By applying the premium principle U(X+π)=Eh[X+π]=0, one obtains the risk measure(15)ρh(X)≔π=-Eh[X]=-∫-∞∞xd(h∘FX)(x),cf. Section 4.1, which is known as a distortion risk measure in the actuarial literature (cf. Denneberg, 1990; Wang, 1996; Denuit et al., 2006). Substitutingx=FX-1(p)yields(16)ρh(X)=-∫01qX(p)dh(p)=-∫01dhdpqX(p)dp,which shows that ρh(X) has the structure of a spectral risk measure. Again we take FXto be continuous and strictly monotonically increasing. OtherwiseFX-1has to be interpreted as generalized inverse.It can indeed be shown that for a concave distortion function h, the risk measure ρh(X) fulfills the axioms of spectral risk measures (Tsanakas and Desli, 2003, p. 18). Thus, by the definition(17)φ(p)≔dh(p)dp,each concave distortion function induces a spectral risk measure ρφ(X). Equivalently, any risk spectrum φ(p) defines a concave distortion function h(p) as integral(18)h(p)=∫0pφ(s)dsof the differential Eq. (17). Thus, spectral risk measures are obviously equivalent to distortion measures with concave distortion functions.This equivalency immediately induces the following key result: Spectral risk measures can be derived from the premium principle, using the representation U(X)=Eh[X] of the dual theory of choice. Thus, for any spectral risk measure ρφ(X) the relation (4), i.e.(19)ρφ(X)⩽ρφ(Y)⇔Eh[X]⩾Eh[Y]foranyX,Y∈L0(Ω,F,P),naturally holds for h(p) given by (18). Any spectral risk measure uniquely reflects some preference relation, encoded in h(p), which is consistent with the dual theory of choice. Furthermore, by (18) any risk spectrum corresponds to a concave distortion function, and thus spectral risk measures reflect the decision maker’s risk aversion. Finally, any risk averse behavior of a decision maker, whose preference relation is consistent with the dual theory of choice, can be encoded in a risk spectrum, and finally be expressed in terms of a spectral risk measure.This correspondence (17) between distortion function h(p) and risk spectrum φ(p) enables the definition of a local measure for the risk aversion, encoded in a given risk spectrum. Putting (17) into the modified Pratt-Arrow-coefficient rDPA, Eq. (14), yields(20)rDPA(p)=-d2hdp2/dhdp=-dφhdp/φh(p).Thus by defining(21)rSPA(p)≔-dφdp/φ(p),a local measure of risk aversion (‘spectral Pratt-Arrow’ [SPA]) in terms of the risk spectrum φ in the integral representation of the spectral risk measure is defined. As illustration, consider a small Δp>0 and expand the relative change of the risk to linear order:(22)φ(p-Δp)/φ(p)≈1-1φ(p)dφdpΔp=1+rSPA(p)Δp.The coefficient rSPA(p) thus measures the relative increase in weight of the quantiles in the direction of higher losses. Eq. (22) can also be understood as differential equation to construct a risk spectrum φ(p) from a given degree of risk aversion rSPA(p).We conclude this section with three examples referring to former discussions.Example 1The constant risk spectrum φ(p)=1 corresponds to the linear distortion function h=p and has rDPA(p)=rSPA(p)=0. This implies risk-neutral behavior of the decision maker. Note that this also implies that the expected shortfall, which is the spectral risk measure defined by the risk spectrumφh(p)=1αΘ(α-p)reflects risk neutral behavior inside the range of relevant quantiles (Acerbi, 2004).According to the conversion formalism detailed in Appendix B, the exponential risk spectrumφ¯k(1)(p)of Dowd et al. (2008) corresponds to the risk spectrumφk(1)(p)=ke-kp1-e-kwithin the convention of losses described by negative numbers, adopted here. The distortion function follows from (18) ash(p)=k1-e-k∫0qe-ktdt=1-e-kp1-e-k. The Pratt-Arrow-coefficient is rDPA(p)=k, thus reflecting a constant absolute risk aversion.The risk spectrumφ¯γ(2)(p), with 0<γ<1, introduced in Dowd et al. (2008), corresponds to the risk spectrumφγ(2)=γpγ-1, cf. Appendix B. It has the property to induce a spectral risk measure, which falls with increasing parameter γ. This behavior becomes evident by calculating the corresponding Pratt-Arrow-coefficientrSPA(p)=1-γp>0, which is a decreasing function of γ: increasing γ corresponds to a less risk-averse behavior. One arrives at the same conclusion using the corresponding distortion function(23)h(p)=∫0pφγ(2)(t)dt=pγ.The previous section detailed the intimate connection between spectral risk measures (SRMs) and the dual theory of choice. This close relation is the major obstacle in linking expected utility to SRMs, because the two decision systems are incongruent. In this section we show that it is nevertheless possible to construct a bijective map between expected utility and SRMs in a number of cases, using the popular and powerful quantitative finance tool of risk neutral probability measures.We start our discussion with the usual probability space(Ω,F,P)and a (real valued) random variableX:(Ω,F)→(R,B), whereBindicates the Borel-σ-algebra, generated by all open intervals inR. LetFX:R→[0,1]be the distribution function induced by P on the measurable space(R,B).Assume there exists an auxiliary (risk neutral) probability measure Q on(Ω,F), inducing a distribution GXon(R,B), which fulfills(24)EQ[X]=∫-∞∞xdGX(x)=∫-∞∞u(x)dFX(x)=EuP[X].If Q is absolutely continuous with respect to P and vice versa, i.e. P and Q share the same null sets, then according to the theorem of Radon and Nikodym, Q is an equivalent measure with respect to P and there exists a function(25)ψ(x)=dQdP=gX(x)fX(x)andEP[ψ(x)]=1,with the respective density functions fX(x) and gX(x). Because density functions are always non-negative, ψ(x)⩾0 follows immediately. One further obtains(26)∫-∞∞u(x)dFX(x)=∫-∞∞xψ(x)dFX(x)=∫01qX(p)ψ(qX(p))dp.If ψ(x1)⩾ψ(x2) for any x1⩽x2, one can identify φ(p)=ψ(qX(p)). This somewhat abstract idea is demonstrated and clarified in several examples.Example 1u(x)=−e−kxand X∼N(μ, σ). Define(27)α=EP[X]-EuP[X]=μ+expkμ+12k2σ2and chose GX(x)=FX(x+α). Obviously both measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each other so share the same null sets. The Radon-Nikodym-derivative is(28)ψ(x)=fX(x+α)fX(x)=e-αx-α22,which is monotonically decreasing for α>0. Notice that this condition can always be enforced because of the freedom of linear transformation of the utility function. The resulting risk aversion function isφ(p)=exp-αqX(p)-α22. Furthermore, one can calculate the corresponding distortion function(29)h(p)=GXFX-1(p)=FXFX-1(p)+α,which is exactly the risk neutral distortion measure of Wang (2000).u(x)=xγwith 0<γ<1 and X∼Exp(μ). First calculate the expected utility under P(30)EuP[X]=∫0∞xγμe-xμdx=μγΓ[1+γ],with Γ denoting the Euler gamma function.1Expressions like (30), involving standard integrals, whose generic solutions can be found in mathematical references like Abramowitz and Stegun (1972), are presented without intermediate calculation steps hereafter.1Choose GX(x) to be the exponential distribution with expectation μγΓ[1+γ] and calculate the Radon-Nikodym-derivative(31)ψ(x)=μ1-γΓ[1+γ]e-x·μ1-γ-Γ[1+γ]μΓ[1+γ].ψ(x) is monotonically decreasing, if μ1−γ>Γ[1+γ] holds. The quantile function can be calculated explicitly for the exponential distribution and one obtainsFX-1(p)=-μlog[1-p]. Thus, the corresponding risk aversion function is(32)φ(p)=α(1-p)α-1withα=μ1-γΓ[1+γ].A brief calculation shows that the distortion function is h(p)=1−(1−p)α, which is concave for α>1. But this is again exactly the condition for ψ(qX(p)) to be an admissible risk spectrum.u(x)=log x and X∼Exp(μ). The calculation of the expected utility under P yields(33)EuP[X]=logμ-γwithγ=limn→∞∑k=1n1k-logn≈0.577216,where γ indicates Euler’s constant. For log μ>γ one may choose GX(x) to be the exponential distribution with expectation log μ−γ, and then obtains(34)ψ(x)=αe-xμ(α-1)withα=μlogμ-γ.Again, the risk aversion function and the corresponding distortion function take the form(35)φ(p)=α(1-p)α-1andh(p)=1-(1-p)α.At this point we can outline a preliminary procedure for the linking process. We will discuss some consequences subsequently in more detail:1.Calculate the expected utility functionalEuP[X]under P.Pick an auxiliary distribution GX(not necessarily from the same family) with identical support and expectationEQ[X]=EuP[X].Construct the Radon-Nikodym-derivative ψ(x)=gX(x)/fX(x), and check that it is a monotonic decreasing function of its argument.Identify the risk spectrum φ(p)=ψ(qX(p)) of the corresponding spectral risk measure, where the quantileqX(p)=FX-1(p)is calculated under P.First we should state more precisely what we mean by (risk neutral) auxiliary probability measure. For a risk neutral agent, the utility function is linear, and thus by the freedom of linear transformation we can choose the identity functionũ(x)=x. Any probability measure, satisfying the requirements of the Radon-Nikodym-theorem, and additionally satisfyingEuP[X]=EũQ[X]may serve as auxiliary probability measure to construct the desired link between EU and SRMs.The relation described above clearly depends on the choice of the auxiliary measure Q and is thus somewhat arbitrary. This corresponds to the situation in finance, where in incomplete markets there is usually a continuum of arbitrage-free pricing measures. On the other hand, in complete markets there is a special and unique risk neutral measure, singled out by the no arbitrage condition. So the natural question arises: are there situations in which a preferred measure in the process of linking EU and SRMs exists?It turns out that there is such a preferred measure embedded in a more general set of conditions under which a one-to-one mapping between expected utility and spectral risk measures can be established.In this section, we derive more general conditions and a mechanism for the linking process between EU and SRMs, provided that these conditions hold. In order to motivate our approach, we built on the idea of a preferred equivalent probability measure, discussed in the last section.Considering Eq. (26) one can postulate the following relation(36)∫-∞∞u(x)dFX(x)=∫-∞∞xu(x)xdFX(x)=∫-∞∞xg(x)f(x)dFX(x).Identifying terms one obtains(37)g(x)=u(x)xf(x).Note that g(x) defined in this way need not satisfy the requirements of a probability density function. In particular, it is neither guaranteed to be normalized, nor non-negative everywhere. However, under certain conditions it is possible to use linear transformation freedom of utility functions to render(38)ψ(x)=g(x)f(x)=au(x)+bxa valid Radon-Nikodym-derivative. The following theorem and its corollary provides sufficient conditions for ψ(x) to induce an admissible risk spectrum. The subsequent proposition gives a sufficient condition for EP[ψ(x)] to be normalizable.Theorem 6.1Let u(x) be an arbitrary utility function, satisfying the first four Inada-conditions, a>0 a positive scale factor, andψ(x)≔au(x)x. If a can be chosen, such that(39)EP[ψ(x)]=EPau(x)x=1,then ψ(qX(p)) is an admissible risk spectrum.In order to induce an admissible risk spectrum, ψ(x) has to be non-negative and monotonically decreasing. The first four Inada-conditions are (i) u(0)=0, (ii) u is continuously differentiable, (iii) u is strictly increasing in x, and (iv) u is strictly concave. We first prove that ψ(x) is strictly monotonic, and subsequently that it is non-negative and decreasing.In order to be strictly monotonic, the derivative ψ′(x) must not have finite roots. We proof the absence of finite roots by contradiction. Assume there is at least one finite root, then the equality(40)ψ′(x)=au′(x)x-au(x)x2=0has to hold for at least one x=x0. This immediately implies(41)au′(x0)=au(x0)x0=ψ(x0).Notice that (40) is always well defined because of conditions (i) and (ii). Now differentiating both sides of (41) and using condition (40) yields(42)ψ′(x0)=au″(x0)=0,which is a contradiction, because a>0 by definition, and by (iv) u″(x)<0 for allx∈R.To show that ψ(x) is non-negative and decreasing, first calculate ψ(0). Using (ii) and L’Hospitals-rule, one obtains(43)limx→0ψ(x)=au′(0)>0.In the limit x→∞, u(x) may either converge to a finite value, or diverge itself. In the first case obviously ψ goes to zero as x becomes large. In the second case one can again use L’Hospitals-rule and because of (iii) and (iv) one obtains(44)0⩽limx→∞au′(x)<au′(0).Thus, because ψ(x) is strictly monotonic, it is decreasing and because its limit is bounded by lim infx→∞ψ(x)=0, it is non-negative for allx∈R.□Let u(x) be a utility function, satisfying the Inada-conditions (ii)–(iv). One can use the translation freedom of utility functions to chooseb∈R, such that u(x)+b satisfies (i)–(iv).The proof is trivial, simply choose b=−u(0).□These results are indeed very powerful, because one need no longer choose an auxiliary probability measure. Instead this measure is induced by the utility and distribution function under P. Furthermore, the family of functions satisfying the first four Inada-conditions is fairly large. All classical utility functions with exception of the quadratic utility are represented in this class. We finally give a sufficient condition for EP[ψ(x)] to be normalizable.Proposition 6.3LetX:Ω→S, withS⊆R, be a P-measurable random variable, andu:D→Ra utility function, satisfying the first four Inada-conditions. EP[ψ(x)] is normalizable, ifS⊆D.Let ψn(x)=min[ψ(x), n], withn∈R+. ψn(x) is non-negative, because ψ(x) and n are non-negative by proof of Theorem 6.1 and by definition, respectively. Furthermore, ψn(x) is P-measurable and thus by the bounded convergence theorem(45)∫Sψ(x)P(dx)=limn→∞∫Sψn(x)P(dx)<∞,because P is a finite measure and ψn(x) is bounded P-almost surely onS⊆D.□As a consequence of the last proposition, one only has to ensure that the domain of the utility function contains all possible realizations x of X. If additionally u(x) is a continuously differentiable, risk averse utility function obeying the Inada-conditions, then a unique one-to-one mapping between EU and SRMs exist.The whole procedure of mapping an expected utility functional Eu[X] to a spectral risk measure ρφ(X) can be summarized as follows:1.Check that the co-domain of X is a subset of the domain of u, and ensure that the utility function is continuously differentiable and strictly concave.Choose b=−u(0) and define v(x)=u(x)+b. Now v(x) is a utility function, satisfying Inada-conditions (i)–(iv).Calculate E[v(x)/x] and set the result equal to a−1. Define w(x)=av(x). w(x) is still a utility function, satisfying the Inada-conditions.Set ψ(x)=w(x)/x and define the risk spectrum φ(p)=ψ(qX(p)), with the quantile-functionqX(p)=FX-1(p).Calculate the spectral risk measure(46)ρφ(X)=-∫01φ(p)qX(p)dp.We conclude this section by illustrating the entire procedure in the following example:Example 1We stick to the setup of Example 2 of Section 5, u(x)=xγwith 0<γ<1 and X∼Exp(μ), because the exponential distribution has an analytic quantile function.1.For exponentially distributed X, the co-domain isS=R+. Furthermore, u(x)=xγis continuously differentiable and strictly concave for 0<γ<1. Its natural domain isD=R+and thusS⊆Dholds.Obviously u(0)=0 and therefore b=0 holds. Consequently v(x)=u(x).The next step is normalizing EP[ψ(x)]. Define(47)g(x)=av(x)xf(x)=axγ-1μe-xμ,where a>0 is the yet unknown scale factor. Normalizing the integral over g(x) immediately yields(48)∫0∞g(x)dx=aμγ-1Γ[γ]=!1⇒a=μ1-γΓ[γ],and w(x)=xγμ1−γ/Γ[γ]. Calculating the preferred auxiliary probability density (which is by no means necessary but very instructive), one obtains(49)g(x)=xγ-1μγΓ[γ]e-xμ,which is immediately identified as Gamma-distribution,X∼Γγ,1μ.Continuing this dual interpretation one obtains the Radon-Nikodym-derivative(50)ψ(x)=w(x)x=g(x)f(x)=xγ-1μγ-1Γ[γ],which is monotonically decreasing and non-negative for 0<γ<1, as required. Considering the quantile function qX(p)=−μ log[1−p] of the exponential distribution, the risk spectrum is given by(51)φ(p)=ψ(qX(p))=(-log[1-p])γ-1Γ[γ].Fig. 1(left) illustrates the risk spectrum for different values of γ. The corresponding distortion function is given by(52)h(p)=1-Γ[γ,-log[1-p]]Γ[γ],and is represented in Fig. 1 (right) for different values of the parameter γ.The final step is to calculate the spectral risk measure, resulting in(53)ρφ(X)=-∫01φ(p)qX(p)dp=-μγfor γ>−1, which is fulfilled by definition.As expected, the spectral risk measure depends on both the utility function and the respective probability distribution in terms of their parameters γ and μ.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The relation between expected utility theory, the dual theory of choice, and spectral risk measures has thoroughly been investigated. Using the premium principle and the results from actuarial literature, regarding the intimate relationship between spectral risk measures and so called distortion risk measures, it was shown that spectral risk measures can be used to model any risk averse behavior of a decision maker, whose preference relation is consistent with the dual theory of choice. Based on this result, a local measure for the risk aversion encoded in the risk spectrum of the spectral risk measure was defined and several examples were provided. This relationship between the dual theory of choice and spectral risk measures is the fundamental reason, why it is generally not possible to construct a one-to-one-mapping between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures.However, it was demonstrated that a one-to-one mapping between any given expected utility functional and a spectral risk measure can be established by a transformation of the respective probability measure. The necessary tools originated in mathematical finance. The resulting SRM usually contains the parameters of the utility function, as well as those from the involved P&L-distribution. The consequence is that the frequently criticized merging of utility function and risk preferences in EU-theory is projected onto the resulting SRM. Our findings make it possible, under fairly weak conditions, to construct a unique spectral risk measure given utility and P&L distribution families. Inside these families the mapping is one-to-one and order preserving. Across different P&L-distributions, the order preserving property of this link is lost, because expected utility and the dual theory of choice are incongruent decision systems.In this appendix, the calculation for the exponential utility function, used for example in the discussion of the method of Sriboonchitta et al. (2010) in Section 4 is presented.Consider the utility function(54)u(x)=1-e-kxwithk>0.Calculate the auxiliary functionf0(x)=exp-∫cxu(t)dt:(55)∫cxu(t)dt=∫cx(1-exp[-kt])dt=x+1kexp[-kx]+c̃,and thus(56)f0(x)=Nexp-1kexp[-kx]+x.The norm N will be determined below. Calculate the second auxiliary functionF0(x)=∫-∞xf0(t)dt:(57)F0(x)=N∫-∞xexp-1kexp[-kt]+tdt.Substituting z≔exp[−kt] yields(58)F0(x)=Nk∫exp[-kx]∞exp-zkz1/k-1dz.Using Eq. (3.381.3) of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (1980) with u=exp[−kx], μ=1/k and ν=1/k one arrives at(59)F0(x)=Nkμ-νΓ[ν,μu]=N(1/k)-1/k+1Γ1k,1kexp[-kx],where Γ represents the incomplete Gamma functionΓ[a,x]=∫x∞e-tta-1dt(Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972, p. 260). The norm N can be calculated from the condition(60)∫-∞∞f0(t)dt=F0(∞)=1,yielding(61)N-1=(1/k)-1/k+1Γ1k,0=(1/k)-1/k+1Γ1k.Eventually, the second auxiliary function is obtained(62)F0(x)=k2Γ1k-1Γ1k,1kexp[-kx].Calculate the third auxiliary functionΦ(F0(x))=ddxu(x), respectivelyΦ(p)=ddxu|x=F0-1(p):(63)Φ(p)=kexp-kF0-1(p)=kexp[-kqX(p)].The quantile functionqX(p)=F0-1(p)cannot be expressed in a closed form. Finally quadrature yields(64)A≔∫01Φ(p)dp=k∫01exp-kF0-1(p)dp.Substitutingx≔F0-1(t)yields(65)A=k∫-∞∞dF0dxexp[-kx]dx=k∫-∞∞f0(x)exp[-kx]dx.Using the density, one obtains(66)A=(1/k)1/k-1Γ1k-1k∫-∞∞exp-1kexp[-kx]+xexp[-kx]dx,which after substituting z≔exp[−kx] yields(67)A=(1/k)1/k-1Γ1k-1∫0∞exp-zkz1/kdz.Eq. (3.381.4) in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (1980) with μ=1/k and ν=1/k+1 leads to(68)A=(1/k)1/k-1Γ1k-1(1/k)-1/k-1Γ1k+1=k,where the recursion formula Γ[z+1]=zΓ[z] was used (cf. Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972, p. 256). Eventually, the risk spectrum(69)φk(p)=Φ(p)/A=exp-kF0-1(p)follows.Throughout the financial literature both possible sign conventions for measuring losses may be found: either losses are described as negative numbers, implying that, say, an outcome of −100$ means that a loss of 100$ is realized or losses are described as positive numbers, implying that an outcome of 100$ means that a loss of 100$ is realized. In this appendix, the transformation from one convention to the other in the context of spectral risk measures is presented to enhance the comprehensibility of the discussions in the main text.First, consider a financial position with random P&L-variable X and assume that losses are described by negative numbers. Consider some spectral risk measure(70)ρφ(X)=-∫01φ(p)qX(p)dp.Furthermore, assume that by changing the sign of the losses, i.e. by setting X↷−X, the risk assigned to the P&L-variable does not change. Formally, an equivalent risk spectrumφ¯(x)has to be constructed, such that(71)ρφ¯(-X)=-ρφ(X)holds. Using the equality qX(p)=−q−X(1−p) for the quantiles, the calculation is straightforward:(72)ρφ(X)=-∫01φ(p)qX(p)dp=∫01φ(p)qX(1-p)dp=∫01φ(1-p̃)qX(p̃)dp̃with the substitutionp̃=1-pbeing made from first to second line. Thus, by choosing(73)φ¯(p)≔φ(1-p)the required equality (71) holds.As examples, consider the three risk spectraφ¯k(1),φ¯γ(2)andφ¯γ(3)introduced by Dowd et al. (2008) with the convention that losses are described by positive numbers. Using Eq. (73) one can write the equivalent risk spectraφk(1),φγ(2)andφγ(3)with the convention that losses are described by negative numbers immediately:(74a)φk(1)=ke-kp1-e-k,(74b)φγ(2)=γpγ-1,(74c)φγ(3)=γ(1-p)γ-1.In Section 4.3, the relationship between risk spectrum φ(p) and concave distortion function(75)φh(p)=ddph(p)was derived within the convention of describing losses by negative numbers. Switching to the convention of describing losses by positive numbers, an equivalent relation(76)φ¯h¯(p)=ddph¯(p)has to hold. In order to calculate the relation between h andh¯, integrate the equation above and use Eq. (73):(77)h¯(p)=∫0pφ¯(t)dt=∫0pφ(1-t)dt=-∫11-pφ(y)dy=∫01φ(y)dy-∫01-pφ(y)dy=1-h(1-p),where the substitution y=1−t, Eq. (18), and the fact that φ(p) is normalized was used. This functionh¯is known as conjugated distortion function and is convex, if h is concave. This consistently reflects risk aversion within the convention of decribing losses by positive numbers, cf. (Yaari, 1987; Denuit et al., 2006). Furthermore(78)φ¯(p)=dh¯(p)dp=dhdxx=1-p=φ(1-p)holds. Within the convention of describing losses by negative numbers, the distortion risk measure(79)ρh(X)=-∫01qX(p)dh(p)=-∫01dhdpqX(p)dpwas defined, cf. Eq. (16). Using the relations derived above, the transformation to the convention of describing losses by positive numbers reads(80)ρh(X)=-∫01qX(p)dh(p)=-∫01dhdpqX(p)dp=∫01dhdpq-X(1-p)dp=∫01dhdxx=1-p̃q-X(p̃)dp̃=∫01dh¯(p̃)dp̃q-X(p̃)dp̃=∫01q-X(p̃)dh¯(p̃)=-ρh¯(-X),where the substitutionp̃=1-pwas used. The transformed result agrees with Eq. (3.8) and (3.9) of Denuit et al. (2006).
