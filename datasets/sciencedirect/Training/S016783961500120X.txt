@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A rational motion is a motion with only rational trajectories. In the dual quaternion model ofSE(3), the group of rigid body displacements (Selig, 2005, Ch. 9), it is described by a rational curve on the Study quadric (Jüttler, 1993). In this article we construct a rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model with a given rational curve as trajectory, and we show that this motion is unique up to coordinate changes. This is an interesting result in its own right but it also has a certain potential for applications in computer graphics, computer aided design or mechanism science.Usually, one defines the degree of a rational motion as the maximal degree of a trajectory (Jüttler, 1993). With this concept of motion degree, our problem becomes trivial as the curvilinear translation along the curve is already minimal. As we shall see, it is also minimal with respect to the dual quaternion degree if the prescribed trajectory is generic. The situation changes, however, if the trajectory is circular, that is, it intersects the absolute circle at infinity. In this case, the minimal achievable degree in the dual quaternion model is the curve degree minus half the number of conjugate complex intersection points with the absolute circle at infinity (the curve's circularity).We will see that twice the circularity of a trajectory equals the trajectory degree minus the degree defect in the spherical component of the minimal motion. This leads to the rather strange observation that generic rational motions (without spherical degree defect) have very special (entirely circular) trajectories. Conversely, the minimal motion to generic (non-circular) curves are curvilinear translations which are special in the sense that their spherical degree defect is maximal.We continue this article with an introduction to the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements in Section 2. There we also introduce motion polynomials and their relation to rational motions. Our results are formulated and proved in Section 3. The proof of the central result (Theorem 2) is constructive and can be used to actually compute the minimal rational motion by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm. We illustrate this procedure by two examples.In this article, we work in the dual quaternion model of the group of rigid body displacements. This model requires a minimal number of parameters while retaining a bilinear composition law. Moreover, it provides a rich algebraic and geometric structure. It is, for example, possible to use a variant of the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two polynomials. This section presents the necessary theoretical background on dual quaternions.The setDHof dual quaternions is an eight-dimensional associative algebra over the real numbers. It is generated by the base elements1,i,j,k,ε,εi,εj,εkand the non-commutative multiplication is determined by the relationsi2=j2=k2=ijk=−1,ε2=0,iε=εi,jε=εj,kε=εk.As important sub-algebras, the algebra of dual quaternions contains the real numbersR=〈1〉, the complex numbersC=〈1,i〉, the dual numbersD=〈1,ε〉, and the quaternionsH=〈1,i,j,k〉(angled brackets denote a linear span). A dual quaternion may be written ash=p+εqwhere p,q∈Hare quaternions. The conjugate dual quaternion ish‾=p‾+εq‾and conjugation of quaternions is done by multiplying the coefficients of i, j, and k with −1. It can readily be verified that the dual quaternion norm, defined as‖h‖=hh‾, equalspp‾+ε(pq‾+qp‾). It is a dual number. The non-invertible dual quaternionsh=p+εqare precisely those with vanishing primal partp=0.An important application of dual quaternions is the modelling of rigid body displacements. The group of dual quaternions of unit norm modulo{±1}is isomorphic toSE(3), the group of rigid body displacements. A unit dual quaternionh=p+εqacts on a point x in the three dimensional real vector space〈i,j,k〉according to(1)x↦pxp‾+pq‾−qp‾=pxp‾+2pq‾.Note that−qp‾=pq‾because of the unit norm condition. It is convenient and customary to projectivise the spaceDHof dual quaternions, thus arriving atP7, the real projective space of dimension seven. Then, the unit norm condition can be relaxed to the non-vanishing ofpp‾and the vanishing ofpq‾+qp‾. In a geometric language,SE(3)is isomorphic to the points of a quadricS⊂P7, defined bypq‾+qp‾=0, minus the points of a three-dimensional space, defined byp=0. The quadric S is called the Study quadric. In this setting, the map (1) becomesx↦pxp‾+pq‾−qp‾pp‾=pxp‾+2pq‾pp‾.The action ofh=p+εqwithp≠0,pq‾+qp‾=0can be extended to real projective three-spaceP3, modelled as projective space over〈1,i,j,k〉. The point x represented byx0+x1i+x2j+x3kis mapped according tox↦x0pp‾+p(x1i+x2j+x3k)p‾+2x0pq‾=pxp‾+2x0pq‾.This is a convenient representation for studying rational curves as trajectories of rational motions.In the projective setting, a rational motion is simply a curve in the Study quadric S that admits a parameterisation by a polynomial(2)C=∑i=0ncitiwith dual quaternion coefficientsc0,…,cn∈DH. The non-commutativity ofDHnecessitates some rules concerning notation and multiplication: Polynomial multiplication is defined by the convention that the indeterminate commutes with all coefficients, the ring of these polynomials in the indeterminate t is denoted byDH[t], the subring of polynomials with quaternion coefficients isH[t]. We always write coefficients to the left of the indeterminate t. This convention is sometimes captured in the term “left polynomial” but we will just speak of a “polynomial”.Evaluating C at different valuest∈Rgives points of a rational curve inP7. We also defineC(∞):=cn=limt→∞⁡t−nC(t)in order to obtain the complete curve as image ofP1:=R∪{∞}under the mapt↦C(t). A similar convention is used for rational curves inP3.The conjugate to the polynomial (2) isC‾:=∑i=0nci‾ti.It can readily be verified that the norm polynomialCC‾has dual numbers as coefficients. IfCC‾has even real coefficients and the leading coefficientcnis invertible, we call C a motion polynomial. This is motivated by the observation that the curve parameterised by a motion polynomial is contained in the Study quadric, that is, it parameterises indeed a rigid body motion. WritingC=P+εQwith P,Q∈H[t], motion polynomials are characterised by the vanishing ofPQ‾+QP‾.The trajectory of the pointx=x0+x1j+x2j+x3k∈P3is(3)t↦PxP‾+2x0PQ‾,t∈P1.This is a curve parameterised by polynomial functions in projective coordinates. It is also called a rational curve because it is always possible to clear denominators of rational functions. All motions inSE(3)with only rational trajectories can be parameterised by motion polynomials (Jüttler, 1993).A rational parameterised equationx=x0+x1i+x2j+x3kwithx0,x1,x2,x3∈R[t]is called reduced if the greatest common divisor g ofx0,x1,x2,x3has degree zero. The degree of x is defined as the maximal degree ofx0,x1,x2,x3. If x is not reduced, we may divide it by g to obtain an equivalent parameterised equation which describes the same rational curve, but possibly with fewer parameterisation singularities.Given a reduced parameterised equation x of degree d, it is our ultimate aim to find a motion polynomialC=P+εQ∈DH[t]of minimal degree such that the trajectory of one point p is parameterised by x. An obvious example of a motion polynomial with trajectory x is the curvilinear translation along x and it will turn out that this is already the solution to our problem in generic cases. However, for trajectories which are non-generic, in a sense to be made precise below, a lesser degree can be achieved.A motion polynomialC=P+εQis called reduced, if both P and Q have no common real factor. The real factor of the primal part P with maximal degree is uniquely defined up to a constant scalar factor. We call it maximal real polynomial factor and abbreviate it by “mrpf”. It accounts for a difference in degrees between the rational motion, parameterised byC=P+εQ, and its spherical component, parameterised by P. Hence, we also call the degree of the maximal real polynomial factor of P the spherical degree defect of C.We only consider reduced rational motions but do not exclude motions with positive spherical degree defect. It will turn out that the spherical degree defect and circularity of trajectories are closely related:Definition 1The circularity of a rational curve with reduced rational parameterised equationx=x0+x1i+x2j+x3kis defined as12deg⁡gcd⁡(x0,x12+x22+x32).The curve is called entirely circular if it is of maximal circularity12deg⁡x.Geometrically, circularity is half the number of (conjugate complex) intersection points of x and the absolute circle at infinity, counted with their respective algebraic multiplicities. Hence, it is always an integer (this also follows algebraically from the fact thatx0,x1,x2,x3are real and prime) and does not depend on the chosen parameterisation, as long as it is reduced.Theorem 1Let C be a reduced motion polynomial of degree n and spherical degree defect m. Then a trajectory of C is of degreed≤2n−mand circularityc≥(d−m)/2.Remark 1In Theorem 1, the strictly less and strictly greater cases can occur. One example of this is the general Darboux motion (Li et al., 2015c, 2015a) wheren=3,m=d=2,c=0and hence2=d<2n−m=4(but0=c=(d−m)/2). Another example is the circular translation motion (Li et al., 2015c, 2015a) withn=m=d=2,c=1. Here2=d=2n−mbut1=c>(d−m)/2=0.Lemma 1AssumeA,B∈H[t]. If a monic quadratic irreducible real polynomial Q is a factor of the product AB, then Q either divides A or Q divides B or there are a unique quaternionq∈Hand two quaternion polynomialsA1andB1such thatQ=(t−q)(t−q‾),A=A1(t−q)andB=(t−q‾)B1.ProofIt is sufficient to prove the third case under the assumptiongcd⁡(Q,A0)=gcd⁡(Q,B0)=1whereA0:=mrpfA,B0:=mrpfB. There exist uniquely determined quaternionsq1,…,qr,q1′,…,qs′such that•Q=(t−qi)(t−qi‾)=(t−qj′)(t−qj′‾)fori∈{1,…,r}andj∈{1,…,s},A=A0QA,B=B0QBwhereQA:=(t−qr)⋯(t−q2)(t−q1),QB:=(t−q1′)(t−q2′)⋯(t−qs′), andgcd⁡(A0A0‾,Q)=gcd⁡(B0B0‾,Q)=1.As Q divides AB, we get that Q dividesA0‾AABB0‾=A0‾A0QAQBB0B0‾. But then Q also dividesQAQB. This can happen only if two neighbouring linear factors are conjugate and, because ofgcd⁡(Q,mrpfA)=gcd⁡(Q,mrpfB)=1, impliesq1=q1′‾whence the claim follows withq:=q1=q1′‾.  □Proof of Theorem 1LetT:=2x0+ε(x1i+x2j+x3k)be the translation which moves a pointx=x0+x1i+x2j+x3kto the origin 1 and letC˜=CT−1. Then the orbit of x with respect to C is equal to the orbit of the origin 1 with respect toC˜. Because we havedeg⁡(C˜)=deg⁡(C)and the spherical degree defect of C equals the spherical degree defect ofC˜, it is sufficient to prove the statement forC˜and the origin 1 (instead of C and x). From now on, we use the symbol C to abbreviateC˜. LetC=P+εQ, setG:=mrpfP,m:=deg⁡G,P′:=P/Gand use (3) to compute a parametric equation y for the trajectory of the origin 1:y=PP‾+2PQ‾=G2P′P′‾+2GP′Q‾≡GP′P′‾+2P′Q‾,where we write “≡” for equality in the projective sense, modulo scalar (or real polynomial) multiplication. The trajectory's degree is not larger than2n−m.WithN:=gcd⁡(GP′P′‾,mrpf(P′Q‾))andr:=deg⁡N, the degree of the trajectory y isd=2n−m−rbecause we havey≡(GP′P′‾+2P′Q‾)/N. IfP′P′‾/NandQQ‾/Nare polynomials, the circularity is half the degree ofgcd⁡(GP′P′‾N,P′P′‾QQ‾N2)=P′P′‾Ngcd⁡(G,QQ‾N).This would then imply that the circularity is not less thann−m−r/2, which equals(d−m)/2ford=2n−m−r. Thus, we have to show that N divides both,P′P′‾andQQ‾.Moreover, it is sufficient to prove the claim only for a reducedC0:=P0+εQ0as the claim in the non-reduced case follows easily. SetN0:=gcd⁡(G0P0′P0′‾,mrpfP0′Q0‾)whereG0:=mrpfP0andP0′:=P0/G0. It is a useful fact thatN0has no real linear factor because such a factor would also divideG0(becauseP0′∈H[t]has no real factor and henceP0′P0′‾has no real linear factor either) andQ0(because it dividesP0′Q0‾andP0′has no real factor). But this contradicts the reducedness ofC0. Now we proceed by induction on the degree s ofN0. Note that s is zero or an even positive integer.In case ofs=0,N0is a real constant and the claim is clear.Lets≥2. Then there is a monic quadratic irreducible real polynomialM1which dividesN0. SetN1:=N0/M1. We claim that there always exists a quaternion q and two quaternion polynomialsP1′andQ1such thatM1=(t−q)(t−q‾),P0′=P1′(t−q)andQ0=Q1(t−q). We handle the proof of this claim by distinguishing three cases:1.M1dividesG0. ThenM1cannot dividemrpfQ0because of the reducedness of C. SinceM1is a divisor ofN0which dividesP0′Q0‾,M1must divideP0′Q0‾. SinceP0′has no real polynomial factor, by Lemma 1, there is a unique quaternion q and two polynomialsP1′andQ1such thatM1=(t−q)(t−q‾),P0′=P1′(t−q)andQ0=Q1(t−q).M1does not divideG0but dividesmrpfQ0. ThenM1must divideP0′P0′‾. SinceP0′has no real polynomial factor, by Lemma 1, there is a unique quaternion q such thatM1=(t−q)(t−q‾),P0′=P1′(t−q). Then we setQ1:=Q0(t−q‾)/M1which is a polynomial and satisfiesQ0=Q1(t−q).M1divides neitherG0normrpfQ0. By Lemma 1, there are a unique quaternion q and two polynomialsP1′andQ1such thatM1=(t−q)(t−q‾),P0′=P1′(t−q)andQ0=Q1(t−q).Remark 2Calling a rational motion generic if the primal part has no real factors one interpretation of Theorem 1 is as follows: A trajectory of a generic rational motion can be entirely circular (actually, only few exceptions are known). A similar statement for algebraic planar motions can be found in Bottema and Roth (1990, Ch. XI). There, also a more detailed discussion on the circularity of trajectories can be found. For planar rational curves, the geometric circularity conditions there imply the algebraic circularity conditions of Theorem 1.As one consequence of Theorem 1, among all rational curves of fixed degree, curves of high circularity can be generated by rational motions of low degree. In particular, we obtain the desired bound on the degree of a rational motion with a given rational trajectory:Corollary 1If a rational curve of circularity c and degree d is a trajectory of the rational motionC=P+εQ, the degree of C is not less thand−c. If it is of degreed−c, the degree defect of the spherical motion component equalsd−2c.We will see below in Section 3.2 that the bound of Corollary 1 is sharp.Example 1Let us illustrate above results by simple examples from literature. In case ofdeg⁡C=1, the only generic rational motions are rotations with fixed axis. Their generic trajectories (trajectories that maximise the degree among all trajectories) are circles and, of course, entirely circular. Rational motions withdeg⁡C=2are generated by reflecting a moving frame in one family of rulings on a quadric H, see Hamann (2011). The generic case is obtained if H is a hyperboloid. In this case, generic trajectories are of degree four. Their entirely circularity has already been observed in Bottema and Roth (1990, Ch. IX, §7). The non-generic trajectories are circles. Points with non-generic trajectories lie on two skew lines that coincide if H is a hyperboloid of revolution. Finally, if H is a hyperbolic paraboloid, generic trajectories are just of degree three and circularity one (Hamann, 2011).Now we turn to the task of computing a rational motionC=P+εQof minimal degreedeg⁡C=nwith a given rational parameterised curvex=x0+x1i+x2j+x3kas trajectory. Denote the degree of the trajectory by d and its circularity by c. By Corollary 1 we haven≥d−c. We will prove that, up to coordinate changes, exactly one solution of minimal degreen=d−cexists and we also provide a procedure for its computation.Theorem 2Letx=x0+x1i+x2j+x3kbe a reduced rational parametric equation of a rational curve such thatx(∞)≡1. Then there exists a unique monic rational motion polynomialC=P+εQof minimal degree, such thatC(∞)=1and the trajectory of 1 is parameterised by x.A key ingredient in our proof of Theorem 2 is a version of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the left gcd of two polynomialsF,G∈H[t]. This is a well-known concept in the theory of polynomials over rings, see Ore (1933). Call the polynomialL∈H[t]a left factor or left divisor of F if there existsQ∈H[t]such thatF=LQ. The polynomialD∈H[t]is called left gcd of F and G, if D is a left divisor of F and G and any left divisor E of F and G also left divides D. The left gcd is unique up to right multiplication with a non-zero quaternion.The Euclidean algorithm in this context is based on polynomial right division. GivenR0,R1∈H[t], there existQ2,R2∈H[t]such thatR0=R1Q2+R2anddeg⁡R2<deg⁡R1. Note that the order of factors in the productR1Q2is important. If D is a left divisor ofR0andR1, then D is also a left divisor ofR1Q2and ofR2. Conversely, a left divisor ofR2andR1also left dividesR0. Hence the left gcd ofR0andR1equals the left gcd ofR1andR2. Assumingdeg⁡R0≥deg⁡R1, we also havedeg⁡R0>deg⁡R2and we may recursively define sequencesR2,R3,…andQ2,Q3,…of polynomials with strictly decreasing degree byRk−2=Rk−1Qk+Rk,k≥2.The recursion ends as soon asRk=0whence the left gcd isD=Rk−1. Using polynomial long division, an algorithmic implementation of this algorithm is straightforward.Lemma 2IfC∈H[t]andM∈R[t]is an irreducible (overR) quadratic factor ofCC‾, then M and C have a left gcd of positive degree.ProofUse polynomial right division to computeQ,R∈H[t]withC=MQ+R=QM+Randdeg⁡R≤1. ThenCC‾=(MQ+R)(MQ‾+R‾)=M(MQQ‾+QR‾+RQ‾)+RR‾.IfR=0, then M itself is a left gcd of C and M. Otherwise, M is a left factor ofRR‾which impliesM≡RR‾. Hence, R is a left factor of M and also of C. □Lemma 3For any polynomialC∈H[t]of positive degree and a monic divisorR∈R[t]ofCC‾withgcd⁡(R,mrpfC)=1, there exists a unique monic quaternion polynomial P (the left gcd of C and R) and a unique quaternion polynomial Q such thatPQ=CandPP‾=R.ProofThe polynomial R has no real linear factor because such a factor necessarily is a divisor of C which contradictsgcd⁡(R,mrpfC)=1. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can compute the unique monic left gcdP0of C and R, i.e.,(4)P0Q=C,P0P1=RwithQ,P1∈H[t]. We claim thatP0andP1both have no real polynomial factor:•A real polynomial factor ofP0is also a real polynomial factor of C and R and contradictsgcd⁡(R,mrpfC)=1.A real polynomial factor ofP1must have a real quadratic factor M which is irreducible overR(because R has no real linear factor). That is, for someP1′∈H[t]we haveP1=P1′M. We can writeR=P0P1=P0P1′M=R′MwhereR′is real. From this we inferP0‾R′=P0‾P0P1′. BecauseP0‾has no real polynomial factor, the real polynomialP0‾P0dividesR′andP0‾P0Mdivides R but alsoCC‾=QQ‾P0P0‾(a multiple of R). This implies that M dividesQQ‾and, by Lemma 2, Q and M have a left gcdP2withdeg⁡P2>0. But then, by (4),P0P2is a left divisor of C and R anddeg⁡P0P2>deg⁡P2. This contradicts the fact thatP0is left gcd of C and R.As to uniqueness, we observe that P is necessarily the unique monic left gcd of C and R. Uniqueness of Q follows from uniqueness of P.  □Proof of Theorem 2Denote the degree of the rational parametric equation x by d and its circularity by c. The conditionx(∞)≡1impliesdeg⁡x0>deg⁡xifori=1,2,3and it is no loss of generality to assume thatx0is monic. There exist a monic polynomial g of degree 2c and two relatively prime polynomials w (monic),y∈R[t]withdeg⁡w=d−2c,deg⁡y<2(d−c), such that(5)x0=gw,x12+x22+x32=gy.Denote byC:=P+εQa (yet unknown) motion polynomial of minimal degree that parameterises the sought rational motion. The parametric trajectory of 1 equals x if(6)x0+x1i+x2j+x3k≡PP‾+2PQ‾wherePQ‾+QP‾=0.WithD:=x1i+x2j+x3k, we have(7)DD‾=x12+x22+x32=gyandwDD‾=wgy=x0y.By Lemma 3, there exist polynomialsP0∈H[t]andQ0∈H[t]such thatP0P0‾=g,P0Q0‾=D.WithP:=wP0andQ:=Q0/2we then havePP‾=w2P0P0‾=w2g=wx0,2PQ‾=wP0Q0‾=wD=w(x1i+x2j+x3k).This shows that P and Q solve the first of the two equations in (6). The second equation follows from the vanishing of the scalar part of D:0=D+D‾=wD+wD‾=2(PQ‾+QP‾). Thus, the polynomialC=P+εQwith P, Q computed as above is one solution to our problem and it is of minimal degreen:=d−c.Conversely, assume thatC′=P′+εQ′is another solution of minimal degreedeg⁡C′=n. Again, we havedeg⁡P′>deg⁡Q′andP′is monic. By the first of the two equations in (6) we get(8)P′P′‾=w′x0,2P′Q′‾=w′D=w′(x1i+x2j+x3k),for some monic real polynomialw′of degreed−2c. By (5), (7), and (8) we getgy=DD‾=4P′P′‾Q′Q′‾w′2=4w′x0Q′Q′‾w′2=4x0w′Q′Q′‾=4gww′Q′Q′‾.If we divide both sides by g and multiply withw′, we getyw′=4wQ′Q′‾.As w and y are relatively prime, we get that w dividesw′. Butdeg⁡w=deg⁡w′and w andw′are monic. Thus, we have(9)w=w′andy=4Q′Q′‾.Left-multiplying the second of two equations in (8) byQ′and using (9), we getP′=w′DQ′2Q′Q′‾=w2DQ′y.As w and y are relatively prime and w is monic,P0′:=2DQ′/ymust be a monic polynomial. We haveP0′P0′‾=4Q′Q′‾DD‾y2=DD‾y=g,2P0′Q′‾=4Q′Q′‾Dy=D.Because ofdeg⁡P0′=deg⁡P0and because the left gcd of g and D is unique, this impliesP0=P0′andQ′=Q0/2=Q. This concludes the proof of uniqueness.  □Remark 3In case of a rational curve of circularity zero, the primal part P of the rational motionC=P+εQis a real polynomial and the trivial solution consists of the curvilinear translation along the given curve. In all other cases, Theorem 2 guarantees solutions of lesser degree than curvilinear translations.Our formulation of Theorem 2 requires a special moving point, the origin 1, to generate the rational curve and produces a motion polynomial C with the special propertyC(∞)≡1. These conditions are just coordinate dependencies and are convenient for our algebraic formulation and proof. If we allow coordinate changes, we may translate 1 to an arbitrary moving point (this amounts to replacing C byCT−1with a suitable translation, as in the proof of Theorem 1) and orient the coordinate axis arbitrarily (this amounts to right-multiplying C withr∈H). Thus, we can re-formulate Theorem 2 asCorollary 2There is a unique (up to coordinate changes) rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements with a prescribed rational trajectory. If the trajectory is of degree d and circularity c, the minimal motion is of degreen=d−c.Remark 4Frequently, the degree of a rational motion is defined as maximal degree of one of its trajectories. With this concept of degree, Corollary 2 is no longer true. A counter example is a circle which occurs as trajectory of a circular translation and of a rotation about its centre. For both motions the maximal degree of a trajectory is two.Let us illustrate Theorem 2 by two examples:Example 2The rational curve given by the parameterised equationsx0=(t2+2t+2)(t2+2t+5)(t+1),x1=2(t2−5)(t2+2t+2),x2=−4(t+5)(t+1)2,x3=−2t(t+2)(t+5)(t+1)is of degree five. From the factorisationx12+x22+x32=8(t2+2t+5)(t2+4t+5)(t2+2t+2)2we see that its circularity is two. By Theorem 2, it is trajectory of a rational motion of minimal degree three whose primal part, by Theorem 1, has precisely one linear factor. With y, w and g defined byg=(t2+2t+2)(t2+2t+5),w=t+1,y=8(t2+4t+5)(t2+2t+2),we havex0=gw,x12+x22+x32=gy.SettingD=x1i+x2j+x3kand using the Euclidean algorithm we compute, according to Lemma 3, the left gcdP0of D and g: WithP0=t2+2t+1−(t+1)i+(2t+2)j−2kandQ0=−2t−2−(2t2+4t+2)i+(2t+6)j+(2t2+8t+6)kwe haveg=P0P0‾,D=P0Q0‾. Then we setP=wP0andQ=Q0/2. As expected, P has a real polynomial factor of degree 1. The motion polynomial we want isC:=P+εQ.Example 3The Viviani curve (Peternell et al., 2013) is given byx0=(1+t2)2,x1=(1−t)2(1+t)2,x2=2t(1−t)(1+t),x3=2t(1+t2).In order to meet the requirements of Theorem 2, we translate it by the vector(−1,0,0)and obtain(10)x0=(1+t2)2,x1=−4t2,x2=2t(1−t)(1+t),x3=2t(1+t2).This curve lies on the unit sphere and is entirely circular. As in the previous example, we computeg=gcd⁡(x0,x12+x22+x32)=(1+t2)2,w=x0/g=1,y=(x12+x22+x32)/g=8t2.The left gcd ofD:=x1i+x2j+x3kand g isP0=t2−t(j+k)−i,the right quotient of D andP0isQ0=2t(k−j),and the minimal motion to the curve (10) isC=t2−(j+k−ε(j+k))t−i.We can simplify by conjugating withT:=1+12εiwhence we getC′:=T‾CT=t2−t(j+k)−i=(t−k)(t−j).This shows thatC′is the composition of two rotations about the second coordinate axis and the third coordinate axis with equal angular velocities, i.e., the motion generated by the rolling of a spherical circle of radiusπ/4on a spherical circle of the same radius. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. There, the moving frame is rigidly attached to the rolling circle.This article unveiled some relations between rational motions and their trajectories. A rational curve occurs as trajectory of a unique (up to coordinate changes) rational motion of minimal degree in the dual quaternion model. This was a surprise to the authors as a mere trajectory seems to leave a lot of freedom for the construction of a suitable rational motion. Apparently, the requirement for minimality is rather restrictive.Calling a rational curve “generic” if its circularity is zero and a rational motion “generic” if its primal part has no real factors (the spherical motion component has full degree), we may also say that rational motions of minimal quaternion degree to a generic trajectory are non-generic. Conversely, the trajectories of a generic rational motion are entirely circular and hence non-generic.In conjunction with the factorisation of generic rational motions (Hegedüs et al., 2013) and its extension (Li et al., 2015b) to non-generic motion polynomials, our results contribute to a variant of Kempe's Universality Theorem (Demaine and O'Rourke, 2007, Section 3.2) for rational space curves. Via motion factorisation, it is possible to construct linkages to generate a given rational motion and hence also a given rational trajectory. The dual quaternion degree of the generating motion is directly related to the number of links and joints in the mechanism. As a consequence, rational curves can be generated by spatial linkages with much fewer links and joints than those implied by the asymptotic bounds for algebraic space curves given by Abbott (2008). For circular curves, the numbers of links and joints are even less. A precise formulation and a rigorous proof will be worked out in a future paper.Our main result in Corollary 2 raises questions. Is a similar uniqueness statement true for algebraic curves and algebraic motions? What rational motions are not minimal for any of their trajectories? The Darboux motion and the circular translation of Remark 1 are examples. Finally, determine simple (classes of) curves with simple minimal motion as in Example 3 and exploit their low degree and rationality in a CAGD or engineering context.
