@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In a deregulated multi-area electrical power system the objective is to determine the most economical generation dispatch strategy that could satisfy the area load demands, the tie-line limits and other operating constraints. Usually, economic dispatch (ED) deals only with the cost minimization, but minimization of emission content has also become an equally important concern due to the mandatory requirement of pollution reduction for environmental protection. Environmental economic dispatch (EED) is a complex multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with conflicting goals. Normally a fuzzy ranking is employed to rank the large number of Pareto solutions obtained after solving a MOO problem. But in this paper the preference of the decision maker (DM) is used to guide the search and to select the population for the next generation. An improved differential evolution (DE) method is proposed where the selection operation is modified to reduce the complexity of multi-attribute decision making with the help of a fuzzy framework. Solutions are assigned a fuzzy rank on the basis of their level of satisfaction for different objectives before the population selection and then the fuzzy rank is used to select and pass on better solutions to the next generation. A well distributed Pareto-front is obtained which presents a large number of alternate trade-off solutions for the power system operator. A momentum operation is also included to prevent stagnation and to create Pareto diversity. Studies are carried out on three test cases and results obtained are found to be better than some previous literature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Economic dispatch (ED) aims to allocate the system load demand among existing generators in the most economical manner, while satisfying all the physical and operational constraints in power system [1]. With increasing global awareness the reduction of harmful pollutants from thermal power generation, has become mandatory for power utilities. Strategies for reducing emission are installation of emission control equipment, replacing of old thermal generators with more efficient ones, modification to old fuel burning equipment and switching to low emission fuel etc [2]. Environmental economic dispatch (EED) offers an effective real time option for reducing fuel cost and emission simultaneously with no additional capital investment. Under multi-area competitive electricity market structure, the power utilities are expected to optimize many conflicting objectives simultaneously with complex equality and inequality constraints. The conventional gradient based optimization methods may not produce feasible solutions for such a multi-objective, discontinuous and non differentiable problem. Powerful multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are required for solving practical problems having non-convex, discontinuous and multi-modal objective functions. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective DE with fuzzy selection where population is updated based on their fuzzy rank. The fuzzy rank reflects the minimum level of satisfaction achieved by a solution for all the objectives. Therefore all the objectives play an equally important role in population updating mechanism and a well distributed Pareto front is obtained. The proposed algorithm can be very easily applied for larger number of objectives also without additional complexity.The pioneering work on EED is reported in [3–5]. The EED was previously solved without including complex generator constraints such as valve point loading effects (VPL) and prohibited operating zones (POZ). For the sake of simplicity researchers normally assumed quadratic cost curves for the EED problem [5–12,14–16,18,19,23,26,38]. In practice, the generator cost curves are nonconvex in nature due to valve point loading effects. Recently, some efforts are made to solve EED problem with generator non-linearities [17,20–22,24,25,27,28,30,33] but these works do not focus on multi-area power system operation where additional tie-line constraints are also applicable. This paper proposes to study the impact of these practical constraints on the EED solution, for a multi-area, reserve constrained power system. Committed research efforts are required for this non-convex problem when all practical constraints are included.Artificial intelligence and evolutionary optimization techniques have become very popular during the last decade. Evolutionary programming technique is proposed in [6] for EED with line flow constraints. Various Artificial neural network based methods are also available for EED problem [7,8]. Methods based on evolutionary algorithms [9], particle swarm optimization (PSO), [10–12], ant swarm intelligence [13], differential evolution (DE)[14–17], genetic algorithm (GA) [18–21], bacterial foraging (BF) [22–24] harmony search (HS) [25,26], interactive Honey Bee Mating Optimization [27], Virus Optimization Algorithm (VOA) [28], teaching learning based algorithm (TLBO) [29], A bare-bones multi-objective PSO [30] and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm [31] are proposed for solving the EED problem effectively. Efficient hybrid nature inspired computing strategies have also been proposed for the EED problem [14,32–37].Some papers address the EED issue as a true multi-objective optimization problem [9–13,15,16,19,21,23,25,27,29,30,33,38] and some expressed the different objectives into a unit function to handle it as a single objective problem using either weighted sum technique or penalty coefficient approach [5–8,12,14,17,18,20,22,24,26,28,31,32,34–37]. The former approach produces non-dominated Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. If conventional techniques are used, then the latter requires many runs with different weights for the objective functions. Evolutionary techniques when applied to MOO have a clear edge over traditional methods because multiple Pareto-optimal solutions can be obtained here in a single run [39]. Due to the population based random search, a large number of solutions are obtained.The concept of fuzziness has found a number of effective and varied applications in nature inspired optimization algorithms for environmental economic dispatch [7,8,12,20,22,38]. A modified neo-fuzzy neuron (MNFN) is proposed [7] for finding the on-line generator scheduling by capturing the dynamic response of demand variation. A neuro-fuzzy power dispatch method is proposed [8] in which the uncertainty in forecasting power demand is modeled as a fuzzy variable. Fuzzy concept is included in PSO [12] and BF [22] for solving economic dispatch problems with environmental concerns. A method using membership function based penalty functions to deal with constraint violations is integrated with GA for finding optimal dispatch of thermal and hydro-thermal systems [20]. A fuzzy dominance based sorting procedure is used in [38] with BF algorithm to find the Pareto front.MOO has received phenomenal research focus due to its vast multi-disciplinary practical application. Selection of the best population is difficult when multiple objectives are to be satisfied [39]. Many MOO algorithms are based on the most popular non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) [40] where Pareto dominance is used for selection. Some algorithms use the preference information to guide the search toward the solutions of interest to the DM [41]. The performance indicators are also used to compare a pair of candidate solutions [42]. A detailed review of available MOO algorithms can be found in [43].An elaborate literature review has been presented in the paper to highlight the importance of the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem in electrical power system operation. The various ED models employed for solving this key issue are discussed. The need for employing evolutionary optimization methods is also highlighted. Though there are large numbers of papers which address the ED problem, very few have addressed ED for multi-area operation with transmission constraints [11,46,48,51]. In [11] a simplified convex model has been used which can also be solved with traditional optimization methods. Refs. [46,48,51] are single objective formulations for minimizing only cost. Multi-objective ED for multi-area operation with discontinuous, nonconvex objective function and practical constraints has not yet been addressed.In this paper a multi-objective multi-area ED has been solved with a new DE approach where the selection operation is modified for multi-objective functions by employing fuzzy logic. The proposed approach gives lot of flexibility to accommodate the DM's preference in selecting the best solution out of the population. Any suitable membership function can be employed for finding the degree of satisfaction for a certain objective. Fuzzy selection is a novel concept which has not yet been reported for any application.A fuzzy decision making module is employed for the selection of population for the next generation. A fuzzy rank is computed for each solution based on the degree of satisfaction of different objectives. Population selection for the next iteration is carried out on the basis of the fuzzy rank. The proposed DE approach with Fuzzy selection has very simple implementation due to the inherent multi-objective selection operation. A momentum operation is also included to maintain Pareto diversity. The proposed algorithm is found to produce a well distributed Pareto front where all the conflicting objectives are properly represented. The proposed approach is tested on three test cases having medium and large sizes. The results are found to be superior to previously published results [11].The idea behind multi-area ED is to determine the generation levels to minimize the total fuel costs while satisfying power balance, generating limit and transmission capacity constraints for a given power demand. The VPL effects are modeled using a rectified sinusoidal function in the fuel input-power output cost function. The total fuel cost (Costt) is given as [44](1)Costt=∑i=1NFi(Pi)=∑i=1NaiPi2+biPi+ci+ei×sin(fi×(Pimin−Pi))where Pirepresents power generation of ith unit, ai, biand ciare the fuel-cost coefficients, and eiand fiare the fuel cost-coefficients of the ith unit to model VPL effects. Cost associated with tie-line power flow is neglected. There are N numbers of generating units, i.e. sum of units in all areas. Sometimes a quadratic curve is used for computing the emission content [5–8,11]. Here the complete emission content Emissiontis represented below as [9,16,19,33].(2)Emissiont=∑i=1NEi(Pi)=∑i=1N10−2×(αi+βiPi+γiPi2)+ξiexp(λiPi)The MANCEED problem can be formulated as simultaneous minimization of fuel cost and emission and can be expressed as:(3)min[Costt,Emissiont]subject to the following equality and inequality constraints:(i)Area power balance constraintsIn multi area problem the power balance constraints must be satisfied for each area. The power balance constraint for the qth area can be given as follows:(4)∑i=1NqPiq=PDq+PLq+∑jMqTjq=0forq=1,2…M(areas)where for the qth area, Piqrepresents power generation of ith unit in the qth area, PDqis the area load demand, PLqis the area power loss, Tjqare the tie-line flows from other areas, Nqare number of generating units such that ΣNq=N and Mqis the number of tie-lines connected to the qth area. For loss calculation, methods based on penalty factors or loss coefficients (B-coefficients) [1] are in use. Using loss coefficients, Bij, Boiand Boothe losses for the qth area are expressed as(5)PLq=∑i=1Nq∑j=1NqPiBijPj+∑i=1NqBoiPi+BooGenerating limit constraintsThe lower and upper limits of real power generation are given by(6)Pimin≤Pi≤Pimaxi=1,2,…,NConstraints due to prohibited operating zonesPractical generating units have POZ due to some faults in the machines or their accessories such as pumps or boilers. [45]. Unit with POZ has discontinuous operating characteristics given by:(7)Pi∈Pimin≤Pi≤Pi,1LPi,k−1U≤Pi≤Pi,kL…Pi,ziU≤Pi≤Pimaxwhere ziare the number of prohibited zones, k is the index of prohibited zone,Pi,kLis the lower limit andPi,k−1Uis the upper limit of (k−1)th prohibited zone of the ith generating unit.Tie-line limit constraintsThe tie-line flows (Tjq) to the qth area should lie between the limits as given by,(8)Tjqmin≤Tjq≤Tjqmax;j=1,2,…,Mq;q=1,2,…,MArea-wise spinning reserve constraintsIn multi area ED problems area-wise reserve constraints require that a specified reserve is provided by the generators of each area. This constraint can be formulated for the qth area as [46](9a)∑i=1Nq(Piqmax−Piq)≥Resq,dforq=1,2,…,Mthe reserve existing on the ith unit of the qth area is (Pimax−Pi), and Resq,dis the required reserve in the qth area. If the above area-wise reserve constraint is released and the system is required to provide a total spinning reserve ResD(irrespective of which area provides how much), then the constraint is given by(9b)ResD=∑q=1M∑i=1Nq(Piqmax−Piq)≥∑q=1MResq,dDifferential Evolution (DE) [47] is a meta-heuristic optimization method particularly suitable for complex, discontinuous and multi-modal problems. In the proposed DEFS, the mutation and crossover operations are modified as explained below and a fuzzy logic based selection operation is proposed for multi-objective problems. The fuzzy selection includes the DM's preference in selecting the population for the next generation. To maintain population diversity a momentum operation [48] is added after the fuzzy selection process. The proposed DEFS can be easily applied to larger number of objectives, without any additional complexity.DE strategies vary in the way the mutant vector is produced. The DE mutation strategies are classified as ‘DE/α/β/δ’ where α refers to the method for selection of the target individual xiwhich forms the base of the mutated vector Zi, β indicates the number of difference vectors, and δ indicates the type of crossover mechanism [47]. The mutant vector, Zifor each target vector xiis formed as [46,47]:(1)Mutation Strategy I: DE/best/1: Zi(t+1)=xi,r1(t)+fm[xi,r2(t)−xi,r3(t)]Mutation Strategy II: DE/rand/1: Zi(t+1)=xi,best(t)+fm[xi,r2(t)−xi,r3(t)]Mutation Strategy III: DE/rand–best/1: Zi(t+1)=xi(t)+fm[xi,best(t)−xi(t)]+fm[xir1(t)−xir2(t)]Mutation Strategy IV: DE/best/2: Zi(t+1)=xi,best(t)+fm[xi,r1(t)−xir2(t)]+fm[xir3(t)−xir4(t)]Mutation Strategy V: DE/rand/2:(10)Zi(t+1)=xir5(t)+fm[xi,r1(t)−xir2(t)]+fm[xir3(t)−xir4(t)]To eliminate the dependence of the DE algorithm on the value of mutation factor, in this paper, three different variants employing time varying fm[46,49] are employed. The value of mutation factor fmin (10) is controlled for the three DEFS variants as explained below.The parameter fmin (10) is made to change chaotically with respect to time as shown below [49].(11)fm(t)=μ×fm(t−1)×[1−fm(t−1)];for chaotic behavior μ=4 and fmis not equal to 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0.The parameter fmin (10) is reduced iteratively from an initial value f2ito a final value f2fas per the dynamics given below [49]:(12)fm(t)=(f2f−f2i)iteritermax+f2i×{μ×fm(t−1)×[1−fm(t−1)}The parameter fmin (10) is increased from an initial value f2ito a final value f2fas per the dynamics given above by (11) and (12)[49].In crossover operation some dimensions of the ‘D’ dimensional target vector (xi) are replaced with the analogous parameters of the Zi, to generate a trial vector (Ui) using the following logic:(13)Uij(t+1)=Zij(t+1)ifrand(j)≤CRor(j=randint(i))xij(t)ifrand(j)>CRor(j≠randint(i))Crossover rate CR is varied in the range [0, 1] and randint (i) is a random integer between 1 and D.In a multi-objective optimization problem defined by (3) there are more than one evaluation functions to be considered, hence it is difficult to compare two solutions. A fuzzy selection method is proposed in this paper by using the concept of Pareto-optimality. If solution vectors X and Y are Pareto-optimal, then neither is better than the other, because if X has better cost, then Y would have a better emission, which means that both are competing solutions. The following steps 1–5 are employed:Step 1: Determination of membership values of objective functions: In the MANCEED problem, the two objectives of cost and emission are conflicting in nature. Hence it is not possible to find a single best solution giving least cost as well as least emission. Fuzzy membership functions assign a degree of fulfillment to each objective. Here, it is assumed that μ(OFm) i.e. the membership value of the mth objective is defined as [50]:(14)μ(OFm)=1;ifOFm≤OFmminOFmmax−OFmOFmmax−OFmmin;ifOFmmin<OFm<OFmmax0;ifOFm≥OFmmaxwhereOFmminandOFmmaxare the minimum and maximum values of the mth objective function. These values are determines by single objective optimization.Step 2: Determination of fuzzy rank: In DEFS approach, the trial and target vector are compared based on their fuzzy rank (FR). The fuzzy rank for the ith solution is obtained using the membership values μ(OFm) for all objectives as(15)FR(xi)=min{μ(OFm)}∀m=1,2…,nforan'n'objectiveproblemThus for each solution a fuzzy rank is assigned using (15) based on the degree of satisfaction of both the objectives. In the result section, Tables 5–7 show the computation of fuzzy rank FR for different solutions.Step 3: Selection using fuzzy rank: The rank of trial vector, FR(Ui) is also found using (15) and then fuzzy selection is proposed to be carried out as,(16)xi(t+1)=Ui(t+1)if(FR(U(t+1)i)>FR(xi(t))xi(t)otherwiseThe trial vector replaces the target vector if its fuzzy rank is better i.e. if all the ‘n’ objectives of trial vector have a higher/better satisfaction level; otherwise the target vector is retained in the population. Thus the individuals are selected using (16) for the next iteration. The fuzzy selection helps in maintaining a well distributed population for all objectives.Step 4: Determination of best compromise solution: The solution which has the highest fuzzy rank is selected as the best performing individual of the population because it satisfies all objectives maximally as compared to other solutions. The best solution is identified using (17) where the fuzzy max operation is employed as,(17)[Best_solutionindex_best]=max(FR(xi))∀i=1,2,3…RStep 5: Momentum operation to maintain Pareto diversity: This operation is employed to keep a steady momentum in the optimization process to maintain Pareto diversity in the selected population. The worst member of the population is the one which has least satisfaction level for all objectives; it is identified as(18)[Worst_solutionindex_worst]=min(FR(xi))∀i=1,2,3…RThe worst member is re initialized by a new member randomly located between the best and the worst solutions, as shown below. Random number ‘r’ assumes values between [0–1] based on uniform probability distribution.(19)xindex_worst(t)=xindex_best(t)+r×(xindex_worst(t)−xindex_best(t))The momentum operation is controlled by a factor momentum rate (MR) as explained in the next section.The paper presents solution of MANCEED problem employing DEFS variants; the iterative steps are given below. The flowchart is given in Fig. 1.Step 1: Selection of variable parameters: Important parameters such as (i) mutation strategy, (ii) DEFS variant, (iii) population size, (iv) initial and final value of the mutation factor (fm), (v) the crossover rate (CR) and (vi) maximum number of iterations, are selected.Step 2: Population initialization: The particles are randomly generated between operating limits Varijmin and Varijmax (Varijrepresents generations and tie-line flows of the ith population member), as given below.(20)Varij=Varijmin+r×(Varijmax−Varijmin)j=1,2…(M+N)Here r is a random number between 0 and 1. The ith particle having dimension (M+N) is represented as:(21)Pi=(Pi1,Pi2…PiN,Ti1,Ti2…TiM)Step 3: Simulation of spinning reserve constraints: If for the ith individual, the existing reserve in the qth area is less than demand (Resq,d), then the jth dimension Pij,q, is modified as below.(22a)Pij,q=Pij,q−Diffq×Pj,qmax∑jPj,qmaxwhereDiffq=Resq,d−∑j(Pj,qmax−Pij,q)When reserve constraint is not implemented on area-basis, as specified by (9b) and the available reserve is found to be less than ResD, then Pij, is modified as:(22b)Pij=Pij−Diffi×Pjmax∑jPjmaxandDiffi=ResD−∑j(Pjmax−Pij)The difference between these two formulations is that in (22a) the violation of reserve requirement is computed for each area and corrective actions are taken on area basis. In (22b) the total reserve requirement is met by all units irrespective of the area in which they are located.Step 4: Simulation of constraints due to prohibited operating zones: If any element Pijof the initial population lies within the kth prohibited operating zone, it is modified as below.(23)Pij=PijkL…if…PijkL≤Pij<Pmid,kPijkU…if…Pmid,k≤Pij≤PijkU;Pmid,kis the midpoint of thekth zoneStep 5: Fitness function evaluation for cost and emission objectives: The fitness objective of MANCEED as given in (3) is to minimize cost as well as emission subject to the constraints specified by (4)–(9). To get a feasible result, the penalty function method is used in this paper and squared constraint violations are integrated in the fitness function. The two fitness function values to be minimized in the MANCEED problem are given by:(24)FT=∑i=1NFi(Pi)+∑q=1Mαq∑i=1NqPiq−PDq+PLq+∑jMqTjq2(25)ET=∑i=1NEi(Pi)+∑q=1Mαq∑i=1NqPiq−PDq+PLQ+∑jMqTjq2;[αqpenalty coefficient for theqth area]Step 6: Generation of donor vector: In DEFS the donor Ziis generated by using (10), (11) and (12).Step 7: Binomial crossover: Binomial crossover is applied in DEFS using (13) to generate a trial vector Ui. Crossover rate CR acts as a decision boundary for the probabilistic exchange.Step 8 Constraint handling for the trial vector: If the generated trial vector is found to violate any of the inequality constraints defined by (6)–(9), it is brought to the nearest boundary by using Step 2–Step 4.Step 9: Fuzzy Selection: The functions FTand ETare evaluated using (24) and (25); then fuzzy ranks are found using (14) and (15). Using (16) it is decided whether trial vector is selected or target vector is selected.Step 10: Best compromise solution: The solution with maximum satisfaction level of cost and emission objectives is identified using (17).Step 11: Momentum operation: For reducing saturation and for maintaining Pareto diversity this operation is very effective. The momentum operation is controlled by momentum rate MR which decides probabilistically whether the worst solution obtained by (18) is to be kept unaltered or is to be reinitialized for the next generation as shown in (26).(26)xindex_worst(t)=xindex_best(t)+r×(xindex_worst(t)−xindex_best(t)),if(rand(t)≤MR)xindex_worst(t),otherwise

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Though the ED model has received immense research focus due to its importance in electrical power system, very few papers address multi-area ED with environmental constraints. A simple and easy to implement multi-objective DE employing fuzzy selection (DEFS) is proposed in this paper for solving the multi-area nonconvex environmental ED (MANCEED) problem. The selection operation in DE is modified to update the population based on a fuzzy rank which reflects the satisfaction level of a solution for all objectives. A momentum operation is introduced to maintain population diversity. The fuzzy selection is shown to be very effective in (i) maintaining a diverse population with competing solutions (ii) as well as in identifying the best solution. The proposed DEFS produces a well distributed Pareto-front with many non-dominated solutions which provide the operator with wide range of trade off choices. The results satisfy all the complex constraints and are found to perform better than the weighted sum approach using classical DE and some previous results from literature. The proposed algorithm can be tested for larger number of objectives without additional complexity and can also be applied to MOO problems of other disciplines.
