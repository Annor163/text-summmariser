@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, the anchor points in DEA, as an important subset of the set of extreme efficient points of the production possibility set (PPS), are studied. A basic definition, utilizing the multiplier DEA models, is given. Then, two theorems are proved which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for characterization of these points. The main results of the paper lead to a new interesting connection between DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory. By utilizing the established theoretical results, a successful procedure for identification of the anchor points is presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nowadays, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is one of the most popular tools for efficiency analysis in multiple input-multiple output framework of the production theory (see Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007; Emrouznejad, Parker, & Tavares, 2008). As can be seen in the DEA literature, the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and applications. Thanassoulis and Allen (1998) used the concept of these points, at first, for the generation of unobserved DMUs and extending the DEA frontier. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) defined these points formally as production possibilities which give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the boundary of the production possibility set (PPS). Rouse (2004) utilized this notion for identifying prices for health care services. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) used the geometrical properties of the anchor points to design and test an algorithm for their identification under variable returns to scale (VRS) assumption of the production technology. In a recently published paper, Thanassoulis, Kortelainen, and Allen (2011) provided another method for identifying the anchor points based upon the radial efficiency scores and slack variables at the optimal solution of envelopment models. They have used this concept for improving envelopment under multiple inputs and outputs in a VRS technology. See also Bougnol (2001) and Allen and Thanassoulis (2004) for more details about the notion and applications of the anchor points.Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme efficient points, the first step for obtaining the anchor points is obtaining the extreme efficient points. There are different algorithms to do this. See Charnes, Cooper, and Thrall (1991) and Dulá and López (2006) among others.In this paper, a basic definition of anchor points, based upon the optimal solutions of the multiplier DEA models and the supporting hyperplanes of the PPS, is given. This definition is close to that given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009). Afterwards, it is proved that a DMU under consideration is an anchor point if and only if by increasing some input or decreasing some output the new unobserved point is located on the boundary of the production possibility set. Due to this result, we obtain a characterization of the anchor points using input-oriented and output-oriented models. Then, utilizing the established theoretical results, an approach for identification of the anchor points is introduced. The presented approach follows the problem from a different standpoint, and determines the anchor points using some sensitivity analysis techniques, while the existing methods do this by obtaining all extreme efficient points of some polyhedrals or by resolving LP problems. It is interesting from a theoretical point of view too, because it provides a new connection between the DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming.The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 contains some preliminaries. In Section 3, some basic theoretical results are addressed. In Section 4, sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory is utilized to provide a new procedure for identification of the anchor points. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions; and the proofs of the main results are given in Appendix A of the paper. Appendix B provides two initial simplex tableaus for two studied LP problems.Suppose that we have a set ofnpeer DMUs,{DMUj,j=1,…,n}, such that eachDMUjproduces multiple outputsyrj(r=1,…,s)utilizing multiple inputsxij(i=1,…,m). We assume thatxij>0(for alli,j) andyrj>0(for allr,j). Also, we assume that there is not any duplicated DMU. Furthermore, letxj=(x1j,…,xmj)Tandyj=(y1j,…,ysj)T.ConsideringDMUoas the unit under assessment, the BCC efficiency measure ofDMUo, in input orientation is obtained by solving the following model. Note that,DMUois an observed DMU, i.e.,o∈{1,…,n}.(1)θoBCC=minθ,s.t.∑j=1nλjxj⩽θxo,∑j=1nλjyj⩾yo,∑j=1nλj=1,λj⩾0,∀j.The above model is called the envelopment form of the BCC model. In the above model,(λ,θ)is the decision variables vector. The vectorλis named the intensity vector and the optimal value ofθ, denoted byθoBCC, exhibits the “input-oriented BCC-efficiency score” of the unit under assessment.Considering(u,v,u0)as the vector of dual variables, the dual of the above model, which is called the multiplier form of the BCC model, is as follows:(2)θoBCC=maxuyo+uo,s.t.vxo=1,uyj-vxj+uo⩽0,∀j,(u,v)⩾0,uofreeinsign.TheDMUois called input-oriented BCC-weakly efficient (radially efficient), ifθoBCC=1. It is worth mentioning thatθoBCC∈(0,1].The BCC output-oriented models in envelopment and multiplier forms can be expressed as follows, respectively:(3)φoBCC=maxφo,s.t.∑j=1nλjxj⩽xo,∑j=1nλjyj⩾φoyo,∑j=1nλj=1,λj⩾0,∀j,(4)φoBCC=minvxo-uo,s.t.uyo=1,uyj-vxj+uo⩽0,∀j,u⩾0,v⩾0,uofreeinsign.In the above two output-oriented models,1φoBCCis called the “output-oriented BCC-efficiency score” of the unit under assessment. Here,φoBCC⩾1, and so the output-oriented BCC-efficiency score belongs to(0,1]. Developing an example demonstrating1φoBCC≠θoBCCis not difficult.TheDMUois called output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient (radially efficient), ifφoBCC=1.The definition below introduces the notion of extreme efficient DMUs. Notice that in the present paper all input–output values of the observed DMUs are positive.Definition 1TheDMUo(xo,yo), is called an extreme efficient DMU, if it is an extreme point of the production possibility set (PPS). Here, we consider the PPS under variable returns to scale assumption of technology, denoted byTv, which is expressed as follows:Tv=(x,y):∑j=1nλjxj⩽x,∑j=1nλjyj⩾y⩾0,∑j=1nλj=1,λj⩾0,j=1,…,n.Hereafter, we denote the set of extreme efficient points ofTvby E.As can be seen in the DEA literature (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2011), the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and application. These points delineate the Pareto-efficient frontier of the PPS(Tv)from the free-disposability portion of the boundary. The anchor points are usually production points with small or big size of input–output factors. These points are far from the central part of the efficiency frontier. As can be seen from Theorem 1 of the present paper and the results given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), the role of some input–output factors in efficiency situation of these units is not considerable.Anchor points were first used by Thanassoulis and Allen (1998). More developments about the anchor points from both conceptual and applied points of view have been done by Bougnol (2001), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), and Thanassoulis et al. (2011). They used the properties of the anchor points to design and test some algorithms for their identification inTv. In this section, we address some basic results for identifying the anchor points ofTv. The first method, which results from some notions and corollaries given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), works based upon the multiplier models.SinceTvis a polyhedral inRm+s, the hyperplanes supporting to this set can be expressed asH(u,v,uo)={(x,y)∣uy-vx+uo=0}, in which(u,v)≠0is the normal vector of the hyperplane, and-uois its level value. Recall that, the hyperplaneH(u,v,uo)supportsTvat(x¯,y¯)∈Tvifuy¯-vx¯+uo=0anduy-vx+uo⩽0for each(x,y)∈Tv.The following definition introduces the concept of anchor points inTv. In this definition, E denotes the set of extreme efficient DMUs. In fact, this property comes from Result 1 in Bougnol and Dulá (2009).Definition 2(Bougnol & Dulá, 2009). LetDMUo=(xo,yo)be the unit under consideration. DMUois called an anchor point if(xo,yo)∈Eand it is located on a supporting hyperplane ofTv, sayH(u,v,uo), such that at least one component of the normal vector(u,v)is zero.It is known thatH(u,v,u0)is a hyperplane supporting toTvat(xo,yo)∈Eif and only if a positive multiplier of(u,v,u0)is an optimal solution to Model (2), see Cooper et al. (2007). Based upon this fact and the above definition (Result 1 in Bougnol & Dulá, 2009), the following optimization problems can be used for testing whetherDMUo=(xo,yo)∈Eis an anchor point or not:(5)uk∗=minuk,(5.1)s.t.∑r=1suryrj-∑i=1mvixij+uo⩽0,∀j≠o,(5.2)∑r=1suryro-∑i=1mvixio+uo=0,(5.3)∑r=1sur+∑i=1mvi=1,(5.4)ur⩾0,r=1,…,s,(5.5)vi⩾0,i=1,…,m,fork∈{1,…,s}; and(6)vt∗=minvt,(6.1)s.t.∑r=1suryrj-∑i=1mvixij+uo⩽0,∀j≠o,(6.2)∑r=1suryro-∑i=1mvixio+uo=0,(6.3)∑r=1sur+∑i=1mvi=1,(6.4)ur⩾0,r=1,…,s,(6.5)vi⩾0,i=1,…,m,fort∈{1,…,m}. Now, definingχo=min{u1∗,…,us∗,v1∗,…,vm∗}, we have the following central result. The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.DMUo∈Eis an anchor point if and only ifχo=0.For obtainingχo, solvingm+sLP problems is required, which can be computationally expensive. But, it is worthwhile to note that when the optimal objective value corresponding to one of the above LP models becomes zero, thenDMUo∈Eis an anchor point and it is not necessary to solve other linear programs. Although the above mentioned approach may not be suitable computationally, this method gives a (weak) hyperplane which makes DMUoanchor point. In the next section, a new approach is given which works invoking the sensitivity analysis techniques.In this section, we utilize the sensitivity analysis techniques in linear programming theory to identify the anchor points. It has advantages from an applied point of view. Furthermore, it is interesting theoretically, because provides a new link between linear programming theory and performance analysis (DEA).The following theorem provides a characterization of anchor points based upon the weak-efficiency of(xo+ei,yo)orxo,yo-yro2erin output-orientation or input-orientation, respectively. This result helps us in providing the sensitivity analysis techniques in sequel. The proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix A.Theorem 2DMUo=(xo,yo)∈Eis an anchor point if and only if one of the following conditions holds:(i)(xo+ei,yo)is output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient, for somei∈{1,…,m},xo,yo-yro2eris input-oriented BCC-weakly efficient, for somer∈{1,…,s}.Regarding the above theorem, for checking that “whetherDMUo=(xo,yo)is an anchor point or not” we should check two conditions (i) and (ii). For surveying conditions (i) and (ii), evaluating(xo+ei,yo)andxo,yo-yrto2erfor alli,rmay be required. To do this, Models (1) and (3) assessing(xo+ei,yo)andxo,yo-yro2ershould be solved. But, for reducing the computational requirements, we do not solve Models (1) and (3) from scratch. We use sensitivity analysis techniques in linear programming theory to do this.Consider LP problem (3) evaluating(xo,yo). Suppose that the Simplex method has produced an optimal basis B by solving this LP. We shall describe how to make use of optimality conditions (primal–dual relationships) for finding the output-oriented efficiency measure of(xo+ek,yo)without solving the following LP problem from scratch:(7)φk+=maxφ,(7.1)s.t.∑j=1nλjxij+si+=xio,∀i≠k,(7.2)∑j=1nλjxkj+sk+=xko+1,(7.3)-∑j=1nλjyrj+sr-+φyo=0,∀r,(7.4)∑j=1nλj=1,(7.5)si+,sr-,λj⩾0,∀i,j,r.The initial simplex tableau for Problem (7) can be seen in Appendix B (Table 1).Comparing Models (3) and (7), it is seen that Model (7) is gotten by replacing the right-hand-side vectorxo01in Model (3) byxo+ek01. Therefore, denoting the simplex right-hand-side of models (3) and (7) byb¯andb¯new, respectively,b¯=B-1xo01will be replaced byb¯new=B-1xo+ek01. The new simplex right-hand-side can be calculated without explicitly evaluatingB-1xo+ek01. This is evident by noting thatb¯new=B-1xo+ek01=B-1xo01+B-1ek00=B-1xo01+B-1ask+=b¯+B-1ask+,in whichask+denotes the column corresponding tosk+in the technological matrix of Problem (3). Also,a¯sk+≔B-1ask+=B-1ek00is the column corresponding to variablesk+in the optimal simplex tableau. So,b¯new=b¯+a¯sk+. Since in the optimal simplex tableau the objective row is nonnegative(zj-cj⩾0)for all variables, the only possible violation of optimality is that the new vectorb¯newmay have some negative components. The variableφis a basic variable in B, because the optimal value ofφis always greater than or equal to one. Two different cases may occur.Case (A):b¯new⩾0: In this case, B remains optimal for Problem (7), and the values of the basic variables areb¯new=b¯+a¯sk+. This case is further divided into two subcases. (Notice thatφis a basic variable.)Subcase A1: The component ofa¯sk+=B-1ek00corresponding toφ, denoted bya¯φ,sk+, is 0.:a¯φ,sk+>0.Note thata¯φ,sk+is not negative because the optimal value of LP (7) is greater than or equal to one.In subcase A1, B remains optimal basis for Problem (7) and the optimal value ofφin Model (7) remains one. So, the unobserved DMU(xo+ek,yo)is output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient, i.e., condition (i) is happened. Hence, in this subcase DMUois an anchor point.In subcase A2, B remains optimal basis for Problem (7) and the optimal value ofφin Model (7) is greater than one. So, the unobserved DMU(xo+ek,yo)is not output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient, i.e., condition (i) is not happened for considered k. Notice that, in this subcase we cannot say whetherDMUois anchor point or not.b¯new≱0. In this case, the dual simplex algorithm (Bazaraa, Sherali, & Shetty, 1993) is used to obtain a new optimal solution for Model (7) by getting feasibility. After implementing the dual simplex algorithm, if the new optimal value ofφis equal to one, then(xo+ek,yo)is output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient (and hence, DMUois an anchor point); otherwise (i.e., if the new optimal value ofφis greater than one),(xo+ek,yo)is not output-oriented BCC-weakly efficient, i.e., condition (i) does not happen for considered k (and hence, here too we cannot say whetherDMUois anchor point or not).If condition (i) holds, then the DMUois an anchor point; otherwise we check condition (ii). For checking condition (ii), we use the sensitivity analysis techniques similar to the above discussion. Here, the optimality conditions for the following LP are examined:(8)θt+=minθ,s.t.∑j=1nλjxij+si+-θxio=0,∀i,∑j=1nλjyrj-sr-=yro,∀r≠t,∑j=1nλjytj-st-=yto2,∑j=1nλj=1,si+,sr-,λj⩾0,∀i,j,r.The initial simplex tableau for Problem (8) can be seen in Appendix B (Table 2).The right-hand-side of the above model is obtained by adding the vector0-yto2et0to that in Model (1), andb¯new=b¯+yto2a¯st-. Note that here in subcase A2, the component ofa¯st-corresponding toθis negative.If condition (ii) holds, then DMUois an anchor point; otherwise DMUois not an anchor point (note that we checked conditions (i) and (ii) so far), and the procedure terminates.The following remark decreases the computational requirements of the above procedure in some situations strongly.Remark 1In checking condition (i), if in optimal tableau of Model (3) one of the input-slack variables, saysk+, is a basic variable, thenb¯new=b¯+a¯sk+⩾0anda¯φ,sk+=0. Hence subcase A1 is happened. Thus, we stop with decision that(xo,yo)is an anchor point. In checking condition (ii), this remark is also valid and helpful.To sum up, in this section we provided a new method for checking that whether a DMU is anchor point or not. The presented procedure gives a new connection between the sensitivity analysis techniques in linear programming theory and DEA. It is interesting theoretically. From a computational point of view, in the method given in this section, we do not solve the DEA models for checking the efficiency position of(xo+ek,yo)andxo,yo-yto2etfrom scratch. Also, in this method finding all extreme points of any polyhedral is not required. Furthermore, from an applied point of view, the introduced procedure automatically gives the weak supporting hyperplane which makes DMUoanchor point.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Anchor points build an important class of extreme efficient points in DEA. These points define the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the frontier of the PPS, as introduced by Bougnol and Dulá (2009). On the other hand, these points define the transmittance from the Pareto-efficiency to weak efficiency. The properties, applications, and identification of these points have been studied by some authors, including Bougnol (2001), Allen and Thanassoulis (2004), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), and Thanassoulis et al. (2011). In this paper, we dealt with these points from a different point of view, and provided some main theorems for characterization of these points. Utilizing these theoretical results, a procedure has been introduced for identification of the anchor points. In this method, solving the LP problems from scratch is not required and the sensitivity analysis tools from linear programming theory are utilized. In fact, it provides a new connection between the DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory.Reduction in the computational requirements of the methods given for identification of the anchor points can be worth studying in future. Also, it seems that the connection between the anchor points and super-efficiency models (see Andersen & Petersen, 1993; Banker & Chang, 2000; Chen, 2005; Soleimani-damaneh, Jahanshahloo, & Foroughi, 2006; Tone, 2002) can be a worthwhile direction for future research.
