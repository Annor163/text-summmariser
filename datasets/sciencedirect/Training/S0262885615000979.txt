@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The detection of vanishing points in a monoscopic image is a first step to the extraction of 3D data. This article shows a partition of the image space in order to determine the type of perspective which is present, thereby allowing the determination of the vanishing point associated with each of the axes of the special reference system (X, Y, Z). Additionally, the Thales' second theorem allows us to determine the position of the vanishing points of the image and to automatize the process. An algorithm has been used with the data provided by the selected edge detector (Prewitt, Roberts, Sobel, Frei-Chen, Kirsch, Robinson 3 levels, Robinson 5 levels and Frei-Chen directional), which provides the location of the vanishing points contained on the image plane. The comparative study includes two variables: the number of vanishing points and the image resolution. The results show that in general the Prewitt's edge detector provides the best results, both positional and statistical. Increasing the image resolution improves the results, although the results obtained for a resolution of 640×480 pixels and another of 1024×768 pixels are very similar.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A monoscopic image is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional scene, obtained as the projection of this scene from one point of vision, giving a perspective. However, in order to use three-dimensional modeling techniques, it is necessary to obtain three-dimensional information from these images by applying photogrammetric or dimensional perspective analysis.When the projection of a three-dimensional scene is made on a plane, the parallel lines converge in a single point called vanishing point. The knowledge of this point is key to carrying out qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of the monoscopic image. From a qualitative point of view, vanishing points can be used to group common lines in contiguous images in order to combine them, and from a quantitative point of view, vanishing points can be used for three objectives: to obtain dimensions using perspective dimensional analysis, for three-dimensional reconstruction or for the auto-calibration of the camera.Therefore, it is necessary to define a reliable methodology for the detection of vanishing points, which is the objective of this research.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have presented different methods for detecting vanishing points in monoscopic images, using an algorithm based on Thales' second theorem applied to photos with different resolutions and numbers of vanishing points.The research focuses on the comparison of 8 gradient-based operators for edge detection: Prewitt, Roberts, Sobel, Frei-Chen, Kirsch, Robinson 3 levels, Robinson 5 levels and Frei-Chen directional. The influence of the number of vanishing points and the image resolution on the results obtained have been analyzed.The methodology followed is accurate, reliable and simple, so that the determination of the vanishing points does not require a large computational effort, contrary to what is necessary for edge detection and line extraction when the resolution of the image is increased.The following conclusions can be drawn from the study:•The use of line attributes eliminates edges that do not contribute to the search for the vanishing point, as well as false edges.Determining the type of perspective facilitates the classification of the point cloud Hi, associating them directly to a single vanishing point.The improvement of the classification of the Hi points allows the algorithm to be more efficient.In general, Prewitt's edge detector provides the best results, both positional and statistical.Increasing the image resolution improves the results, although the difference between the results obtained with a resolution of 640×480 pixels and another of 1024×768 pixels are very similar. Therefore, it is necessary to find a compromise between accuracy and the computational cost of using high resolution images.When the extracted straight lines have little inclination to the spatial axis associated to the vanishing point, the results are not satisfactory.
