@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work gives an improved competitive analysis for an online inventory problem with bounded storage and order costs proposed by Larsen and Wøhlk (2010). We improve the upper bound of the competitive ratio from(2+1k)Mmto less than45(2+1k)Mm,where k, M and m are parameters of the given problem. The key idea is to use linear-fractional programming and primal-dual analysis methods to find the upper bound of a central inequality.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) considered an online inventory problem with deterministic demand where the price of the commodity is uncertain, and decisions as to when and how much to buy have to be made in an online fashion, i.e., without any knowledge of future prices. The goal is to construct online algorithms to make decisions in such an environment and to provide bounds on their worst-case performance. The measurement is the competitive ratio (Borodin & El-Yaniv, 1998; Sleator & Tarjan, 1985), which is the worst-case over all input sequences of the ratio of the cost of the designed algorithm to an optimal offline algorithm, and the smaller, the better.Among several important results, Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) analyzed the online inventory model with bounded storage and fixed order costs, and gave an order strategy with the competitive ratio(2+1k)Mm,where k, M, m are parameters related to the problem. In this note, we will give a new order strategy with competitive ratio less than45(2+1k)Mm.Firstly we review some basic assumptions and notations of the online inventory model with bounded storage and order costs of Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) as follows, for more general inventory models, we refer the reader to e.g. Zipkin (2000).•Let t represent time starting from initial time zero.The items are added to the inventory at times 1, 2, 3,….The demand D is removed evenly during the time interval[t,t+1)and, by scaling, is assumed to be 1.Any fractional amount of D can be identified.The lead time is zero.The procurement price ptvaries within fixed upper and lower bounds M and m, respectively.Let Ltbe the inventory level at time t, and let U denote the starting value of the inventory level, i.e.,L0=U,which is also the maximum storage capacity.Let Qtdenote the quantity ordered at time t. Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) considered two related costs: a fixed order cost S > 0 for each order, and a purchase cost, which is ptQt. The objective is to minimize the total cost under a maximum storage capacity and satisfy the demand without stockout in an online fashion.In their paper, Larsen and Wøhlk considered the following “Bounded storage Order cost Algorithm (BOA)” strategy: letp*=Mm,fix a parameter 1 ≤ b ≤ U, if at time t, we have pt≤ p* andLt≤U−b,orderQt=U−Lt. If pt> p* and Lt< 1, orderQt=b−Lt. They proved that, letb=UkMmwithk=2−MmU+(MmU)2+4MmU+82+4MmU,under the assumption ofU≥(2−1)Mmto ensure b ≥ 1, this strategy can have the competitive ratio(2+1k)Mm.In this note, we will prove that, if we let b be another new value, then the BOA strategy has a better competitive ratio less than45(2+1k)Mm,thus improving their result. Before showing our result, we first review the following definitions and results of Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) which will be useful in our proof.Definition 1Letp*=mM,a phase is a time interval to be from the time the price drops below p* to the next time the price drops below p*, i.e., the phase will consist of a period with low prices, followed by a period with high prices.In any phase, let OPTo(the BOAo) be the fixed order cost of the optimal strategy (the BOA strategy), OPTi(the BOAi) be the purchase cost of the optimal strategy (the BOA strategy), then,OPT=OPTo+OPTiandBOA=BOAo+BOAi.To bound the competitive ratioBOAOPT=BOAi+BOAoOPTi+OPTo,Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) first let11Here we use a different notation from Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) for clarity.g=UbMm,and then separately proved that for any phase and given b,BOAiOPTi≤(2+1g)MmandBOAoOPTo≤gMm1−1/b,then by letting these two upper bounds equal. Solving for g, they obtained the desired competitive ratio(2+1k)Mmwithk=2−1UMm+MmU2+4UMm+82+4UMm.Now to present our result, we will improve the first inequality to a tighter upper boundBOAiOPTi≤(U+bMmU+b)Mm(see Lemma 3 below), then let(U+bMmU+b)Mm=gMm1−1/bto obtain the new b and the corresponding new competitive ratio. Note thatU+bMmU+b=1+b(Mm−1)U+b<1+bMmU=1+1g<2+1g,thus the new strategy has competitive ratio less than(2+1k)Mm. At the end of this note, we will prove this new competitive ratio is less than45(2+1k)Mm.We first need the following result.Lemma 1See Larsen and Wøhlk, 2010, p.689–690For any phase and b ≥ 1, in the worst case, the following results hold,OPTo≥S(x+y+U)UOPTi≥mx+mU+mb+p*(y−b)BOAi≤p*(x+U)+MyBOAo≤S(xb+yb−1+1)where x, y are two parameters in a phase, and x ≥ 0, y ≥ b.Next, we need the following lemma, which is a well-known result,  (see, e.g. Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 151). Here scalar values are represented in regular type and vectors are represented in boldface type, and xTis the transpose vector of the column vector x.Lemma 2If the set{x|eTx+f>0,x≥0}is non-empty, then the linear-fractional programming problemmaxxcTx+deTx+fsubjecttoeTx+f>0x≥0is equivalent tomaxy,zcTy+dzsubjecttoeTy+fz=1y≥0,z≥0BOAiOPTi≤(U+bMmU+b)Mm.By Lemma 1, we haveBOAiOPTi≤p*(x+U)+Mymx+mU+mb+p*(y−b). To bound this value, the key idea is to find a linear-fractional program concerning the decision variables x, y, that is, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the following programming problem:maxx≥0,y≥bp*(x+U)+Mymx+mU+mb+p*(y−b)Lety=y′+b,then the above problem ismaxx,y′p*x+My′+p*U+Mbmx+p*y′+mU+mbsubjecttox≥0,y′≥0By Lemma 2, this linear-fractional programming problem is equivalent to the following linear programming (LP) problemmaxx,y,zp*x+My+(p*U+Mb)zsubjecttomx+p*y+(mU+mb)z=1x,y,z≥0The above LP is equivalent to the following dual problem (see, e.g. Luenberger & Ye (2007)),minααsubjecttomα≥p*p*α≥M(mU+mb)α≥p*U+MbαisfreeThe optimal value ismax{p*m,Mp*,p*U+MbmU+mb}=p*U+MbmU+mb=U+bMmU+bMm. This lemma follows.□Similarly, to boundBOAoOPTo,we have the following result.Lemma 4BOAoOPTo≤Ub−1.By Lemma 1,BOAoOPTo≤xb+yb−1+1x+yU+1. To bound the right hand side, this is also a linear-fractional programming problem,maxx≥0,y≥bxb+yb−1+1x+yU+1Lety=y′+b,the above problem ismaxx≥0,y′≥0xb+y′b−1+bb−1+1xU+y′U+bU+1By Lemma 2, this linear-fractional programming problem is equivalent to the following LP problem:maxx,y,zxb+y′b−1+(bb−1+1)zsubjecttoxU+y′U+(bU+1)z=1x,y,z≥0By LP dual theorem, the above LP problem is equivalent tominααsubjectto1Uα≥1b1Uα≥1b−1(bU+1)α≥bb−1+1αisfreeThe optimal value ismax{Ub,Ub−1,bb−1+1bU+1}. Note that U> b, we havebb−1+1bU+1=Ub−12b−1U+b<Ub−12bb+b=Ub−1Thus the optimal value isUb−1. This lemma follows.□Note that Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) have proved thatBOAoOPTo≤gMm1−1b=bgMmb−1. Recallg=UbMm,their bound is the same to our result. Here we give a new proof.Now we can obtain the following competitive ratio result. Note that we must have b ≥ 1, such that any given order will contain at least one item demand in order for the BOA strategy to be well-defined. The choiceb=UkMmin Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) is equivalent to requiringU≥(2−1)Mm.Theorem 1Letb=(UMm−UMm−1)2+4(U2Mm+UMm)−(UMm−UMm−1)2. Then b≥ 1, and the new competitive strategy has competitive ratio(1)(12U−U/Mm+MmU+1+12(U−U/Mm+MmU+1)2+4UU+1)×Mm,which is less than45(2+1k)Mmunder the restriction ofLarsen and Wøhlk (2010)thatU≥(2−1)Mm.To bound the competitive ratioBOAOPT=BOAi+BOAoOPTi+OPTo,similar to the idea of Larsen and Wøhlk (2010), we note that the maximum ofBOAiOPTiandBOAoOPTois a valid upper bound on the competitive ratio. Then, combined with the results of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we haveBOAOPT≤max{(U+bMmU+b)Mm,Ub−1}.Thus by setting the two upper bounds, i.e. setting(U+bMmU+b)Mm=Ub−1,orb2+b(UMm−UMm−1)−(U2Mm+UMm)=0the only positive solution to this equation isb=(UMm−UMm−1)2+4(U2Mm+UMm)−(UMm−UMm−1)2and the resulting competitive ratio is given by (1).To ensure b ≥ 1, the strategy of Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) is only applicable under the assumption ofMmU≤12−1,while it is easy to verify that the new choice b satisfies b ≥ 1 for any combination of U, M, m.Now, let the new competitive ratio (1) beRnew. We will proveRnew<45(2+1k)Mm. Lett=MmU,thenRnew<12(U+MmU+(U+MmU)2+4)Mm=12(1+t+t2+2t+5)Mm,and(2+1k)Mm=(2+2+4MmU2−MmU+(MmU)2+4MmU+8)Mm=(2+(2+4MmU)(2−MmU−(MmU)2+4MmU+8)(2−MmU)2−((MmU)2+4MmU+8))Mm=(2+(MmU)2+4MmU+8+MmU−22)Mm=12(t2+4t+8+t+2)MmThus we haveRnew(2+1k)Mm<t2+2t+5+t+1t2+4t+8+t+2. To bound the right hand fraction, note thatt2+2t+5+t+1t2+4t+8+t+2≤maxtt2+2t+5+t+1t2+4t+8+t+2,we try to solve the right-hand maximum problem. It is easy to check the fraction is an increasing function of t, thus its maximum value is attained to be45whent→12−1given the competitive ratio of Larsen and Wøhlk (2010) is well-defined, in which we obtainRnew<45(2+1k)Mm. This concludes the theorem.□In summary, our contributions are twofold: by using linear-fractional programming and primal-dual analysis methods to find the upper bound of a central inequality, we improve the upper bound of the competitive ratio from(2+1k)Mmto less than45(2+1k)Mm.
