@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The second track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth natural language processing shared task focused on identifying medical risk factors related to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in the narratives of longitudinal medical records of diabetic patients. The risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking status, and family history, as well as diabetes and CAD, and indicators that suggest the presence of those diseases. In addition to identifying the risk factors, this track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task studied the presence and progression of the risk factors in longitudinal medical records. Twenty teams participated in this track, and submitted 49 system runs for evaluation. Six of the top 10 teams achieved F1 scores over 0.90, and all 10 scored over 0.87. The most successful system used a combination of additional annotations, external lexicons, hand-written rules and Support Vector Machines. The results of this track indicate that identification of risk factors and their progression over time is well within the reach of automated systems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In 2014, the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project, in conjunction with University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), sponsored a shared task in natural language processing (NLP) of narratives of longitudinal medical records. The second track of the i2b2/UTHealth shared task focused on identifying risk factors related to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in diabetic patients.According to the World Health Organization, risk factors for a disease increase the chances that a person will develop that disease [1]. Diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including CAD [2]. Other risk factors include: hyperlipidemia/hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and having a family history of CAD [3]. While the obvious way of detecting risk factors in a patient’s medical record is to look for diagnoses of the aforementioned diseases, consultations with our medical advisors revealed that a more thorough analysis would go beyond diagnoses. It would consider indicators of risk factors which provide medical information that suggests the presence of risk factors. For example, a patient’s medical record might not explicitly state that he is diabetic, but an entry of “insulin” in the patient’s medication list would be a strong indication that the patient does, in fact, have diabetes. Additionally, indicators can provide evidence of the severity of risk factors. For example, a diagnosis of hypertension in conjunction with high blood pressure measurements and a prescription for blood thinning medication suggests that a patient is more at risk for CAD than a person who has hypertension but is managing it with only diet and exercise.With these considerations in mind, we devised a shared task that invited participants to identify risk factors and their indicators in narratives of longitudinal medical records. In addition, participants were also asked to identify whether the risk factor or indicator was present before, during, or after the date on the record, giving the potential to create timelines of a patient’s progress (or lack thereof) towards heart disease over the course of their longitudinal record.This shared task differs from many others in the biomedical domain in two key areas: first, the records in the dataset are longitudinal, so they provide snapshots of the patients’ progress over months and years. Second, the guiding concept when developing this task was to answer a clinical question about the patient, rather than focus on general syntactic or semantic categories. Specifically, we asked the question “How do diabetic patients progress towards heart disease, specifically coronary artery disease? And how do diabetic patients with coronary artery disease differ from other diabetic patients who do not develop coronary artery disease?” [4].This paper provides an overview of the second track (also referred to as Track 2, or the “Risk Factor” or RF Track) of the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 NLP shared task. Section 2 discusses related work, Sections 3 and 4 provide brief descriptions of the data and the annotation process, Section 5 describes the metrics we used to evaluate the participants’ systems, Section 6 provides an overview of the top-performing systems, and Sections 7 and 8 discuss the conclusions from the track.
