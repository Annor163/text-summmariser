@&#ABSTRACT@&#
There are several identical facilities in which precious or dangerous material is processed or stored. Since parts of this material may be diverted by some manager or employee of these facilities or since failures in the processing of the material may occur, an authorized organization inspects these facilities regularly at the beginning and at the end of some reference time interval. In order to shorten the time required for detecting such an illegal activity or failures, in addition some interim inspections are performed in these facilities during the reference time interval. The optimal distribution of these interim inspections in space and time poses considerable analytical problems since adversary strategies have to be taken into account. So far only special cases have been analysed successfully, but these results lead to a conjecture for the solution of the general case which is surprisingly simple in view of the complexity of this inspection problem.Consider the following inspection problem. There are n identical facilities in which precious or dangerous material is processed or stored. Since parts of this material may be diverted by some manager or employee of these facilities or since failures in the processing of the material may occur, an authorized organization – in the following called Inspectorate – inspects these facilities regularly a the beginning and at the end of a reference time interval with the help of which any illegal activity or failures will be detected with certainty. In order to shorten the time required for detecting such an illegal activity or failures, in addition k interim inspections are performed in these facilities during the reference time interval. For these interim inspections, however, random sampling procedures are used which permit the detection of illegal activities only with some finite probability. If the Inspectorate has to take into account strategic behavior of some manager or employee of the facilities – in the following called Inspectee – in case illegal activities are planned, game theoretical methods have to be used in order to determine the optimal distribution of the k interim inspections on the n facilities as well as their timing. The same holds if failures cannot be avoided: One has to assume pessimistically that failures occur in the most disastrous way.An illustration of this inspection problem is the inspection of Spent Fuel Storages in Member States of the European Union. In each of these States there are several storages which contain in so-called casks bundles of spent fuel elements of light water reactors. During an inspection the seals of these casks are checked in order to see whether or not spent fuel elements or rods have been replaced by so-called dummies in order that the fissile material contained in these elements can be diverted. Since in the course of the interim inspections the seals are checked only on a random sampling basis, dummies can only be detected with some finite probability depending on the sample size. So far, work only on single storages has been published by Avenhaus and Krieger (2010).Another illustration is the inspection of production lines. Here, for cost reasons randomly occurring failures, e.g., deviations from the specifications of the product, have to be detected as soon as possible. To be on the safe side one assumes that failures are distributed such that the time between the start of the failure and its detection is maximized.The game theoretical model for this inspection problem is defined as follows: At the beginning of the reference time interval the Inspectorate chooses the storages or facilities for the interim inspections and the timing of these inspections. At the same time the Inspectee decides whether to start an illegal activity immediately and in which facility or not. In the latter case he decides to start the illegal activity right after the first interim inspection and in which facility or not, and so on. Errors of the second kind are taken into account: If an illegal activity is started before an interim inspection, then it will be detected with probability 1−β in the course of this interim inspection once it is started in the facility in which the interim inspection takes place. Both players choose their strategies such that the expected detection time is minimized respectively maximized.Only illegal behavior of the Inspectee is considered which means that the Inspectee has to start an illegal activity right after the last interim inspection if he did not do so before: If one wanted to determine whether or not the Inspectee will prefer legal behavior, payoff parameters would have to be introduced which describe the payoffs in both cases, see, e.g., Avenhaus, von Stengel, and Zamir (2002). Since they would be only relevant if one wanted to determine the inspection effort necessary to deter the Inspectee from illegal behavior – which is irrelevant in case of failures –, this is not done here instead, the number k of interim inspections and the detection probability 1−β, together with the number n of facilities, are considered parameters of the problem.As outlined above in the models considered subsequently the Inspectorate chooses his strategy – facilities and inspection time points – at the beginning of the reference time interval, whereas the Inspectee plans his illegal activities sequentially. This game has already been analysed by Krieger (2010) for n facilities and one or two interim inspections and no errors of the second kind. Similar models have been analysed earlier: Diamond (1982) considers a model without errors of the first and second kind in which both players choose their strategies at the beginning of the reference time interval; he takes n=1 and any k and uses analytical techniques which are totally different from those used here, accordingly they lead to results totally different from those obtained here. Avenhaus and Canty (2005) consider a model with errors of the first and second kind and k interim inspections in one facility, and they assume that both players plan their behavior sequentially. It depends, of course, on the details of an inspection problem which of these models describes reality best.Also, errors of the first kind (false alarms) are not taken into account here for several reasons. First, for the attribute sampling procedures mentioned above they do not exist. Second, as pointed out by Avenhaus and Krieger (2011) in case variable sampling procedures are used, these errors do not have a major impact on the planning of interim inspections considered here. And third, their treatment required again the introduction of payoff parameters, i.e., a subjective element, see, e.g., Avenhaus et al. (2002) whereas the purely statistical–technical approach lends itself immediately to an objective application. Here, the emphasize is put on the spatial dimension, namely the inspection of n storages or facilities.In the following first the base case n=k=1 is considered. Then the marginal cases n=1 and any k, and k=1 and any n, and thereafter a more challenging case not covered so far, k=2 and n⩾2, are analysed in detail. All these results are formulated as Lemmata and lead to the Conjecture for the general case.More generally, these models represent examples for the small but beautiful area of inspection games to which in the past continuing attention was paid by several authors. Probably the first prominent contribution was published by Dresher (1962). Analyses quite differently from the one presented here were published recently by Andreozzi (2010), Deutsch, Golany, and Rothblum (2011), Avenhaus and Krieger (2011), and Fandel and Trockel (2013).Without loss of generality only illegal behavior of the Inspectee is considered now. As mentioned above the problem of randomly caused failures can be interpreted as a game against nature as Inspectee. Let us summarize the assumptions which are derived from the Problem Formulation and which are the basis of the games considered here in a structured way:(i)There are two players: the Inspectee, who runs n storages or facilities (in the following facilities) and the Inspectorate, who performs in these facilities k interim inspections in a reference time interval. Inspections do not consume any time. The number k of interim inspections is known to the Inspectee.The Inspectee behaves illegally in exactly one of the n facilities and exactly once within the reference time interval. The Inspectee starts his illegal activity either at the beginning of the reference time interval or delays it. In the latter case he starts it right after the first interim inspection, maybe in a different facility, or delays it and so on.The Inspectorate performs at the beginning and at the end of the reference time interval a regular inspection at which the illegal activity is detected with certainty if it is not detected before.The Inspectorate decides at the beginning of the reference time interval where and when to perform his inspection(s).In the course of an interim inspection the Inspectorate commits an error of the second kind per interim inspection: The illegal activity being started in one facility is not detected with probability β in the course of the next interim inspection in this facility. This non-detection probability is the same for all facilities.In case of the coincidence of the start of the illegal activity and the interim inspection, the illegal activity in one facility is detected only at the occasion of one of the next interim inspections in this facility or at the end of the reference time interval. In this sense the wording “… right after an inspection …” is equivalent to “… at an inspection …”.The game ends either after that interim inspection at which the illegal activity is detected or after the regular inspection at the end of the reference time interval.The payoff to the Inspectee is the time between the start of the illegal activity and its detection, i.e., the detection time. The payoff to the Inspectorate is the negative of the payoff to the Inspectee (zero-sum assumption).In the following these assumptions will be formalized. Assumptions (ii) and (iv) will be specialized according to the different models to be considered now whereas all other assumptions hold for all models and will not be mentioned again.Consider one facility, i.e., n=1, and a reference time interval [t2,t0] within which one interim inspection, i.e., k=1, will be performed at time point t1. It will turn out that this base case itself is important but beyond that, it will be used to describe details of assumptions and analysis which can be understood better here than in the more complicated cases to considered subsequently.The backward counting of time points will be motivated later. The open interval t2<t1<t0 is chosen here and, appropriately modified, in the following in order that the interim inspection does not degenerate. At time points t2 and t0 regular inspections will be performed with the help of which any illegal activity will be detected with certainty if it is not detected before, whereas with the help of the interim inspection any prior illegal activity will be detected with probability 1−β with 0⩽β<1. The Inspectee will either start his illegal activity at t2 with probability 1−g2 or, if not with probability g2, he will start it with certainty at t1.This means that we consider a non-cooperative two person zero-sum game with sets of strategies(1){g2:0⩽g2⩽1}and{t1:t2<t1<t0}.For the purposes of illustration this game is represented graphically as an extensive form game in Fig. 1. The payoff to the Inspectee, namely the expected detection time, is determined as follows: If the Inspectee starts (with probability 1−g2) his illegal activity at t2 then it is detected at t1 with 1−β and not detected with β. In the former case the detection time is t1−t2, in the latter case t0−t2. If he postpones his illegal activity (with probability g2) to t1, his detection time is t0−t1. Thus the expected detection time is given by(2)E(g2;t1)≔(1-g2)[(1-β)(t1-t2)+β(t0-t2)]+g2(t0-t1).The solution of this game, i.e., optimal strategiesg2∗andt1∗and the optimal payoffE∗≔Eg2∗;t1∗are determined by the saddle point criterion, see, e.g., Morris (1994) or Owen (1988),(3)Eg2;t1∗⩽E∗⩽Eg2∗;t1for allg2∈[0,1]and allt1∈(t2,t0).Here the indifference method for determining optimal strategies is used: They are determined such that the adversary is indifferent with respect to the choice of his own strategy. This means that the inequalities (3) are fulfilled as equalities. With (2) we get the following determinants forg2∗andt1∗:(4)1-g2∗(1-β)-g2∗=0,(1-β)t1∗-t2+β(t0-t2)-t0-t1∗=0.The result is summarized as a Lemma the proof of which can be found in Avenhaus and Canty (2005) and Avenhaus and Krieger (2010).Lemma 1Given the non-cooperative two person zero sum game for one interim inspection in one facility with strategy sets(1)and payoff(2)to the Inspectee. Then optimal strategies as well as the optimal expected detection time are given by(5)g2∗=1-β2-βandt1∗-t2=1-β2-β(t0-t2),E∗=Eg2∗;t1∗=t0-t1∗=12-β(t0-t2).□These forms, simple as they are, will become important for all subsequent cases.A few comments: First, our analysis leads to an explicit dependence of the optimal inspection time pointt1∗on β. Whereas for β=0 the common sense point of view would lead to this result, for β>0 one would hardly arrive at this result without quantitative analysis. The same holds for the Inspectee’s optimal strategy.Second, if one defines the conditional expected detection times, i.e., the expected detection times conditional to the possible starting points t2 and t1 of the illegal activity,H2=(1-β)(t1-t2)+β(t0-t2)andH1=t0-t1,a closer look to Eq. (4) shows, that the optimal strategy of the Inspectorate, i.e.,t1∗, is determined such that they are the same. We will come back to this point.Third, it is interesting that the optimal inspection time pointt1∗depends on the length t0−t2 of the reference time interval and β, while the optimal strategy of the Inspecteeg2∗is only a function of β. It is intuitive, however, thatt1∗as well asg2∗decreases with increasing β: For β close to 1 the detection probability is close to zero and therefore the Inspectee starts with probability close to 1 close after time point t2. Consequently, the Inspectorate will perform his inspections also very early.Fourth, since the expected detection time given by (2) and the following ones are based on time differences, we represent the optimal strategy of the Inspectoratet1∗given by (5) as the length of time between the beginning of the reference time interval and that inspection.Finally, from the application point of view it is interesting the optimal strategy of the Inspectoratet1∗is deterministic. In other words, the Inspectorate can announce the time point of his interim inspection if he wishes so.The two marginal cases are substantial and interesting both from the theory and application point of view but more than that, they are crucial for the Conjecture which is formulated in the last section.Let us consider the case of k of interim inspections in one facility i.e., n=1. According to assumption (iv) the Inspectorate chooses k interim inspection time points tk,…,t1 with tk+1<tk<⋯<t1<t0 in the reference time interval [tk+1,t0].Assumption (ii) means here that the Inspectee starts his illegal activity at tk+1 with probability 1−gk+1 or he postpones it with probability gk+1, in the latter case he starts it at tkwith probability 1−gk(tk) which depends on tkor he postpones it with probability gk(tk), and so on. If he does not start the illegal activity before, he has to do it at t1, i.e., g1(tk,…,t1)=0. For the sake of simplicity we omit the arguments tk,…,tjin the gj, j=2,…,k, we will come back to this point.The time line of the interim inspections and probabilities for starting or postponing the illegal activity is represented graphically in Fig. 2.Thus, the set of strategies of the Inspectee is(6){(gk+1,…,g2):0⩽gj⩽1,j=2,…,k+1}and that of the Inspectorate(7){(tk,…,t1):tk+1<tk<⋯<t1<t0}.For the purpose of illustration the expected detection time for k=2 interim inspections is given byE(g3,g2;t2,t1)=(1-g3)[(1-β)(t2-t3)+β(1-β)(t1-t3)+β2(t0-t3)]+g3[(1-g2)[(1-β)(t1-t2)+β(t0-t2)]+g2(t0-t1)];this formula and the following general one is derived along the same lines which are explained in detail in the base case.With g=(gk+1,…,g2) and t=(tk,…,t1), the expected payoff to the Inspectee, i.e., the expected detection time, is given byE(g;t)=(1-gk+1)Hk+1+gk+1[(1-gk)Hk+gk[(1-gk-1)Hk-1⋯+(1-g3)H3+g3[(1-g2)H2+g2H1]⋯]],where the conditional expected detection times Hj, j=1,…,k+1 are defined by∑m=10…=0Hj≔(1-β)∑m=1j-1βj-1-m(tm-tj)+βj-1(t0-tj).In closed form the expected payoff to the Inspectee is given by(8)E(g;t)≔(1-gk+1)Hk+1+∑j=1k(1-gj)Hj∏m=j+1k+1gm.For any number of interim inspections one getsLemma 2Given the non-cooperative two person zero sum game for k interim inspections in one facility with strategy sets(6) and (7)and payoff(8)to the Inspectee. Then optimal strategies as well as the optimal expected detection time are given by(9)gk+1∗=k(1-β)1+k(1-β)andgj∗=j-1jforj=2,…,k,(10)tj∗-tk+1=(k-j+1)1-β1+k(1-β)(t0-tk+1)forj=1,…,k,E∗≔E(g∗;t∗)=t0-t1∗=11+k(1-β)(t0-tk+1).We have to show that the saddle point criterion(11)E(g;t∗)⩽E∗⩽E(g∗;t)for allg,tis fulfilled. The right hand side of (11) is with (9) and (8)(12)E(g∗;t)=11+k(1-β)Hk+1+(1-β)∑j=1kHi.With induction it can be shown that for anyk∈Nand anyt0,…,tk+1∈RHk+1+(1-β)∑j=1kHj=t0-tk+1holds, therefore, we get with (12)E(g∗;t)=11+k(1-β)(t0-tk+1),i.e., the right hand side of (11) is fulfilled as equality. In order to prove the left hand side of (11) we state that we get for j=2,…,k+1 with (10) andtk+1∗≔tk+1(13)tm∗-tj∗=(j-m)1-β1+k(1-β)(t0-tk+1)for1⩽m<jand for j=1,…,k with (10)t0-tj∗=1-(k-j+1)1-β1+k(1-β)(t0-tk+1),which leads after some lengthy but elementary calculation toHj∗=H1∗for j=2,…,k+1. This implies that the factor of the gj, j=2,…,k+1, disappear in (8) and we getE(g;t∗)=H1∗=t0-t1∗=E∗,i.e., also equality on the left hand side of (11). □Of course, Lemma 1 is a special case of this Lemma. Like in the second comment to Lemma 1 we mention that the optimal strategy of the Inspectorate, i.e.,tk∗,…,t1∗, is determined such that the conditional expected detection times Hjfor j=1,…,k+1 are the same.As mentioned before from the modeling point of view the probabilities gj, j=2,…,k, have to depend on (tk,…,tj). Since, however, the optimal strategy of the Inspectorate is chosen such that the factors of the gj, j=2,…,k, disappear in (8), we ignore this dependence.It is interesting to note that according to (13) the time differencestj∗-tj+1∗,j=1,…,kwithtk+1∗≔tk+1, between two subsequent interim inspection are the same. This result is important for the Conjecture in the last section.Any number k of interim inspections in one facility has already been treated by Avenhaus and Canty (2005); there also errors of the first kind have been taken into account. However, in Avenhaus and Canty (2005) the Inspectorate decides differently than here: He chooses at tk+1 only the time point tkfor the first interim inspection, at tkthat of the second one tk−1, and so on. Even though this model and the one considered here have a totally different information structure, it turns out that for no errors of the first kind the optimal strategies of both players are the same, see also Avenhaus and Krieger (2010).Finally let us mention the model by Diamond (1982). Different as it is from our model and from that considered by Avenhaus and Canty (2005), all three ones have a common feature: The optimal expected detection time is just the time remaining after the last interim inspection.Let us consider now the case of n facilities and one interim inspection, i.e., k=1. According to assumption (iv) the Inspectorate chooses with probability pithe ith facility for the interim inspection and the facility dependent time point t1(i), i=1,…,n. Assumption (ii) means here that the Inspectee chooses with probability g2,i, i=1,…,n, the facility in which he starts his illegal activity at t2, or he postpones it with probability g2. In the latter case he performs it in any facility at time point t1(i).The time lines of the interim inspection and the facility selection probabilities as well as the probabilities for starting or postponing the illegal activity in different facilities is represented graphically in Fig. 3.Thus, the set of strategies of the Inspectee is(14)(g2,1,…,g2,n,g2):∑i=1ng2,i+g2=1and that of the Inspectorate(15)t1(1),…,t1(n),p1,…,pn:∑i=1npi=1,t2<t1(i)<t0,i=1,…,n.The expected detection time is determined as follows: If the Inspectorate performs his inspection in facility i (with probability piand at time point t1(i)) and if the Inspectee starts his illegal activity at the beginning of the reference time interval (with probability g2,i) in the same facility, the detection time is (1−β)(t1(i)−t2)+β(t0−t2). If the Inspectee starts his illegal activity at the beginning in facility l, l≠i (with probability g2,l), the detection time is t0−t2. If he postpones the start to time point t1(i) (with probability g2), the detection time is t0−t1(i).With g=(g2,1,…,g2,n,g2), p=(p1,…,pn) and t=(t1(1),…,t1(n)), the expected payoff to the Inspectee is given by(16)E(g;t,p≔)=∑i=1npig2,i((1-β)(t1(i)-t2)+β(t0-t2))+∑l≠ig2,l(t0-t2)+g2(t0-t1(i)).The result of the game theoretical analysis is presented inLemma 3Given the non-cooperative two person zero sum game for one interim inspection in n facilities with strategy sets(14) and (15)and payoff(16)to the Inspectee. Then optimal strategies as well as the optimal expected detection time are given for i=1,…,n by(17)g2,i∗=1n+1-βandg2∗=1-βn+1-β,(18)t1∗(i)-t2=1-βn+1-β(t0-t2),andpi∗=1n,E∗≔E(g∗;t∗,p∗)=t0-t1∗(i)=nn+1-β(t0-t2).We have to show that the saddle point criterionE(g;t∗,p∗)⩽E∗⩽E(g∗;t,p)for allg,t,p,is fulfilled. However, one sees immediately, that the optimal strategies given by (17) and (18) lead to equality on both sides of the criterion. □Again, Lemma 1 is a special case of this Lemma. The case β=0 has already been treated by Krieger (2010), but it should be mentioned that the generalization to β>0 is neither trivial for establishing the Lemma nor for proving it.Since the facilities are assumed to be the same it is obvious that the optimal inspection strategies are the same for all facilities. Thus one may ask, why we start with different piand t1(i) for i=1,…,n. The reason for our approach is that it can be easily generalized to facility dependent detection probabilities 1−βi, i=1,…,n. In view of our Conjecture, which holds only for βi=β, i=1,…,n, we do not do this here.Other than in the first comment to the previous Lemma there is not such an intuitive interpretation of the choice of the optimal inspection time points: With the expected detection times, conditional on the choice of the facility i, i=1,…,n,H∼2,i(g;t)=g2,i((1-β)(t1(i)-t2)+β(t0-t2))+∑l≠ig2,l(t0-t2),H∼1,i(g;t)=g2(t0-t1(i)),we can only state that p∗ and t∗ are chosen such that∑i=1npi∗H∼2,i(g;t∗)+∑i=1npi∗H∼1,i(g;t∗)=E∗,i.e., independent of the Inspectee’s strategy g.Consider now a more challenging case of two interim inspections in n, n⩾2, facilities which is not covered by the previous ones. The case of k inspections in two facilities leads to a much more complicated expected detection time since it contains polynomials of order k in β.According to assumption (iv) the Inspectorate chooses in the reference time interval [t3,t0] the facility dependent time points of the two interim inspections, and he has n2 possibilities to place them in the n facilities, namely: (1,1) both in the first facility, or (1,2) the first in the first the second in the second facility, and so on.Letp(i2,i1), (i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2, be the probability of the Inspectorate of choosing the facility i2 for the first and facility i1 for the second interim inspection. One has(19)0⩽p(i2,i1)⩽1for all(i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2and∑(i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2p(i2,i1)=1.Depending on the choice (i2,i1) of the two facilities to be inspected, the Inspectorate chooses the time point t2(i2,i1) for the first and t1(i2,i1) for the second interim inspection with the assumption(20)t3<t2(i2,i1)<t1(i2,i1)<t0for all(i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2.Assumption (ii) means here that the Inspectee decides to start his illegal activity right at the beginning in the ith facility, i=1,…,n, or to wait for the first interim inspection. In the latter case he can start his illegal activity in the facility where the first interim inspection takes place, or he can start it in any other facility, or he postpones it again. In that case he has to start the illegal activity right after the second interim inspection.Let g3,iand g3 be the probabilities that the Inspectee starts at t3 his illegal activity in facility i, i= 1,…,n, or postpones it. In the latter case he observes the time point t2=t2(i2,i1) of the first interim inspection and the facility i2 in which it takes place. Depending on i2 and t2 he chooses the probabilities g2,i(i2,t2), i=1,…,n, for starting the illegal activity in facility i at t2 and g2(i2,t2), to postpone it again. With the same argument given in the second comment to Lemma 2 and for the sake of simplicity we omit the argument t2 and write instead only g2,i(i2), i=1,…,n, and g2(i2). Again, the Inspectee starts his illegal activity with certainty at t1(i2,i1) in any facility if he does not do so before.Thus, withg=((g3,i)i=1,…,n,g3,(g2,i(i2),g2(i2))i,i2=1,…,n)the set of strategies of the Inspectee is(21)g:∑i=1ng3,i+g3=1and∑i=1ng2,i(i2)+g2(i2)=1,i2=1,…,nand witht=((t2(i2,i1),t1(i2,i1)i2,i1=1,…,n))andp=((p(i2,i1))i2,i1=1,…,n)that of the Inspectorate(22){(p,t):pandtsubject to(19)and(20)}.The time lines of the interim inspection time points and the facility selection probabilities as well as probabilities for starting or postponing the illegal activity in different facilities are represented graphically in Fig. 4.The payoff to the Inspectee, i.e., the expected detection time, is determined along the same lines which are explained in detail in the base case. If we write for the sake of clarity in the following formula in the curly brackets only t2 and t1 instead of t2(i2,i1) and t1(i2,i1), it is given by(23)E(g;p,t≔)∑i2=1np(i2,i2)g3,i2[(1-β)(t2-t3)+β[(1-β)(t1-t3)+β(t0-t3)]]+∑i≠i2g3,i(t0-t3)+g3∑i≠i2g2,i(i2)(t0-t2)+g2,i2(i2)[(1-β)(t1-t2)+β(t0-t2)]+g2(i2)(t0-t1)+∑i2=1n∑i1≠i2p(i2,i1)g3,i2[(1-β)(t2-t3)+β(t0-t3)]+g3,i1[(1-β)(t1-t3)+β(t0-t3)]+∑i∉{i2,i1}g3,i(t0-t3)+g3∑i≠i1g2,i(i2)(t0-t2)+g2,i1(i2)[(1-β)(t1-t2)+β(t0-t2)]+g2(i2)(t0-t1).For n=2 the sum in the seventh row of formula (23) is defined as zero. We formulate the solution of this game again asLemma 4Given the non-cooperative two person zero sum game for two interim inspections in n facilities with strategy sets(21) and (22)and payoff(23)to the Inspectee. Then optimal strategies as well as the optimal expected detection time are given byg3,i∗=1n+2(1-β)fori=1,2…,n,g3∗=2(1-β)n+2(1-β),g2,i∗(i2)=1/2fori=i20fori≠i2,g2∗(i2)=12,i,i2=1,…,n,t2∗(i2,i1)-t3=1-βn+2(1-β)(t0-t3),t1∗(i2,i1)-t3=21-βn+2(1-β)(t0-t3),p(i2,i1)∗=n-2forall(i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2,E∗≔E(g∗;p∗,t∗)=t0-t1∗(i2,i1)=nn+2(1-β)(t0-t3)for all(i2,i1)∈{1,…,n}2.We have to show that the saddle point criterionE(g;p∗,t∗)⩽E∗⩽E(g∗;p,t)for allg,p,tis fulfilled. One sees after some lengthy calculations, that the optimal strategies given by the Lemma lead to equality on both sides of the criterion.□Again, like in Lemma 2 the time differencest1∗-t2∗andt2∗-t3are the same. Also this result is important for the Conjecture in the last section.The case β=0 has already been treated by Krieger (2010), but here it holds even more so what has been said after Lemma 3, concerning the generalization toβ>0.Also, an interesting result isg2,i∗(i2)=0for i≠i2. This means that the Inspectee will never start his illegal activity right after the first interim inspection in a facility in which that inspection does not take place.The optimal expected detection time is for n=2 the same as that for the base case given in Lemma 1. This property suggests that the Inspectorate may consider in this case the two facilities independently and place the two interim inspections in the facilities at the same time point t∗ according to Lemma 1 (even though we have excluded this possibility in this model), i.e.,p(1,1)∗=p(2,2)∗=0,p(1,2)∗=p(2,1)∗=12,t2∗=t1∗=t∗.Indeed, it can be shown that this strategy is also an optimal strategy.In Fig. 5the proved and proposed optimal expected detection times E∗ which are normalized with respect to the length t0−tk+1 of the reference time interval are given for any number k of interim inspections in any number n of facilities. The entries in the first column and in the first row are taken from Lemmas 2 and 3, the entry for k=2 and n⩾ 2 from Lemma 4. The proposed optimal expected detection times in the shaded area are not yet proven but are simply common sense interpolations.From Lemmata 2–4 – and also from Avenhaus and Canty (2005), Diamond (1982) and Krieger (2010) – we know thatt0-t1∗=E∗. We assume that this holds also for the general case and therefore, omitting for the sake of simplicity the argument of thetj∗,j=1,…,k, we gett1∗-tk+1=t0-tk+1-E∗.Lemmata 2 and 4 show that the time differencestj∗-tj+1∗,j=1,…,k, withtk+1∗≔tk+1, between two subsequent interim inspection are the same. If we assume again that this holds for the general case, we gettj∗-tj+1∗=t1∗-tk+1k=t0-tk+1-E∗k.Thus, with E∗ taken from Fig. 5 together with (9) andg2,i∗(i2)from Lemma 4 one is led immediately to the followingConjectureConsider the non-cooperative inspection game with k interim inspections in n facilities. The Inspectorate chooses with probabilityp(ik,…,i1)at the beginning of the reference time interval the facilities to be inspected: (ik,…,i1), im∈{1,…,n}, where imis the facility which is inspected at the k−m+1th interim inspection. Depending on the choice of the facilities (ik,…,i1), he chooses for the interim inspections the time points tj(ik,…,i1), j=1,…,k, with tk+1<tk(ik,…,i1)<⋯<t1(ik,…,i1)<t0.The Inspectee decides at the beginning of the reference time interval to start his illegal activity immediately in facility i, i=1,…,n, with probability gk+1,i, or to postpone it with probability gk+1. If he does not start the illegal activity before time point tj, j=2,…,k, he will do it now in facility i with probability gj,i(ik,…,ij) or postpone it again with probability gj(ik,…,ij). Finally, the Inspectee starts his illegal activity with certainty at t1(ik,…,i1) in any facility if he does not so before. Then an optimal strategy of the Inspectee is given bygk+1,i∗=1n+k(1-β)fori=1,…,nandgk+1∗=k(1-β)n+k(1-β)and for all j=1,…,k, all i=1,…,n and all (ik,…,i1)∈{1,…,n}kbygj,i∗(ik,…,ij)=1/jfori=ij0fori≠ijandgj∗(ik,…,ij)=j-1j.An optimal strategy of the Inspectorate is for all j=1,…,k and all (ik,…,i1)∈{1,…,n}kgiven bytj∗(ik,…,i1)-tk+1=k-j+1n1-β1+k/n(1-β)(t0-tk+1),p(ik,…,i1)∗=1nk.The optimal expected detection time is for all (ik,…,i1)∈{1,…,n}kgiven byE∗=t0-t1∗(ik,…,i1)=11+k/n(1-β)(t0-tk+1).□Note that for n=k one always gets the same optimal expected detection E∗ as for the base case. More generally, E∗ depends only on the ratio k/n; for k/n≪1 it tends towards t0−tk+1 whereas for k/n≫1 it tends towards zero, which is intuitive.There is a striking contrast between the complexity of the general inspection problem as expressed by the payoff function and the strategies of both players on the one hand and the simplicity of its solution on the other hand; this is demonstrated already for those cases for which the Conjecture has been proven. Whereas further special cases of this Conjecture may be proven with some patience, e.g., the cases k=n=3 or even k=3 and any n, at present it appears to be unfeasible to even formulate the payoff function, i.e., the generalization of (23), for any k, n and β. Thus it remains a challenge to prove the most general form of this Conjecture which appears to be so deceptively simple.Nevertheless the application of the findings of the Conjecture is recommended already now: Consider the inspection of Spent Fuel Storages in Member States of the European Union which has been mentioned in the Introduction: Due to internal regulations of the Inspectorate at most two interim inspections are required for all Storages of each State thus, for the planning of these inspections at present the results of the Lemmata can be used. In the future new situations may occur, but then the Conjecture may provide at least a useful guideline.
