@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A proper internal validation is necessary for the development of a reliable and reproducible prognostic model for external validation. Variable selection is an important step for building prognostic models. However, not many existing approaches couple the ability to specify the number of covariates in the model with a cross-validation algorithm. We describe a user-friendly SAS macro that implements a score selection method and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. We discuss the method and applications behind this algorithm, as well as details of the SAS macro.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Survival data is commonly found in clinical trials. Survival analysis involves any of time to event, recurrence, death information, along with a censoring indicator. Censoring indicator is needed to specify if the patient has been lost to follow up, or has yet to experience the event of interest. It has quickly become a staple of many areas of clinical research, especially in biomarker analysis, in the era of personalized medicine. Identifying variables associated with better or worse survival prognosis is useful in guiding exploration of the underlying mechanisms in natural disease progression as well as treatment options in clinical trials. However, the variability between labs, and often within the same lab, has made apparent the need for validation of such models. These validation methods typically focus on external validation using independent datasets and derived statistics or internal validation using resampling methods [1].Each method has its own disadvantages, including sample size constraints, external validation resources, feasibility of usage given data dimensions, and censoring. Suggested or otherwise published methods generally refer to studies with a relatively large sample size and a comparatively small amount of variables of interest (less than 10). Some studies suggest validation approaches such as the split sample method and 2-fold cross-validation (CV) that have been shown to perform very poorly in model selection for smaller samples [4]. Regular incorporation of plasma samples and tools such as multiplex arrays in biomedical research often results in data that is not quite high-dimensional, but does not have the structure of the aforementioned studies, rendering the methods restricted or difficult to implement. These methods along with the 5-fold and 10-fold CV approaches also have the disadvantage of requiring a reduction of the dataset into subsets that may not be conducive to variable selection for a relatively high number of variables without using high-dimensional techniques or penalized methods. Other suggested solutions to the validation question include the use of statistics that may require special consideration of censored observations [2–4]. The Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach has the advantages of producing model estimates with less bias and more ease in smaller samples [5].Over the course of our collaboration with medical oncologists and laboratory biomarker scientists across phase II clinical trials exploring 35+ biomarkers, we have developed and implemented a SAS software macro. This macro allows us to identify an internally-validated prognostic signature that can possibly distinguish high and low-risk patients. The method has proven effective in identifying user-specified size of multivariable signatures that are capable of highlighting low risk groups with median survival time that is twice as long as high risk group in both smaller [6] and larger [7] samples. To our knowledge there is no such functionality readily available in SAS software to build these parsimonious models.We present this macro in the following paper. Sections 2.1–2.4 provide a brief review of statistical concepts related to the macro. Section 2.5 describes the macro and in Section 3 we detail an example of its use. And finally we present a discussion in Section 4.The SAS Survival LOOCV Macro is available to download from our website <http://web.hku.hk/~herbpang/SASsurvLOOCV.html>.
