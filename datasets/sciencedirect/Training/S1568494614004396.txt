@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new outranking approach for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems is developed in the context of a simplified neutrosophic environment, where the truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree and falsity-membership degree for each element are singleton subsets in [0,1]. Firstly, the novel operations of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs) and relational properties are developed. Then some outranking relations for simplified neutrosophic number (SNNs) are defined, based on ELECTRE, and the properties within the outranking relations are further discussed in detail. Additionally, based on the outranking relations of SNNs, a ranking approach is developed in order to solve MCDM problems. Finally, two practical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, a comparison analysis based on the same example is also conducted.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In many cases, it is difficult for decision-makers to precisely express a preference when solving MCDM problems with inaccurate, uncertain or incomplete information. Under these circumstances, Zadeh's fuzzy sets (FSs) [1], where the membership degree is represented by a real number between zero and one, are regarded as an important tool for solving MCDM problems [2,3], fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning [4], and pattern recognition [5].However, FSs cannot handle certain cases where it is hard to define the membership degree using one specific value. In order to overcome the lack of knowledge of non-membership degrees, Atanassov [6] introduced intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), an extension of Zadeh's FSs. Furthermore, Gau and Buehrer [7] defined vague sets and subsequently, Bustince [8] pointed out those vague sets and IFSs are mathematically equivalent objects. To date, IFSs have been widely applied in solving MCDM problems [9–16], neural networks [17,18], medical diagnosis [19], color region extraction [20,21], and market prediction [22]. IFSs simultaneously take into account the membership degree, non-membership degree and hesitation degree. Therefore, they are more flexible and practical when addressing fuzziness and uncertainty than traditional FSs. Moreover, in some actual cases, the membership degree, non-membership degree and hesitation degree of an element in IFSs may not be a specific number; hence, they were extended to interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) [23]. In order to handle situations where people are hesitant in expressing their preference regarding objects in a decision-making process, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) were introduced by Torra and Narukawa [24,25]. Furthermore, Zhu et al. [26,27] proposed dual HFSs and outlined their operations and properties. Chen et al. [28] proposed interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets (IVHFSs) and applied them to MCDM problems. Farhadinia [29] discussed the correlation for dual IVHFSs and Peng et al. [30] introduced a MCDM approach with hesitant interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (HIVIFSs), which is an extension of dual IVHFSs.Although the theory of FSs has been developed and generalized, it cannot deal with all types of uncertainty in different real-world problems. Types of uncertainty, such as indeterminate and inconsistent information, cannot be managed. For example, when an expert is asked for their opinion about a certain statement, he or she may say the possibility that the statement is true is 0.5, the possibility that the statement is false is 0.6 and the degree that he or she is not sure is 0.2 [31]. This issue is beyond the scope of FSs and IFSs and therefore some new theories are required.Smarandache [32,33] proposed neutrosophic logic and neutrosophic sets (NSs) and subsequently Rivieccio [34] pointed out that a NS is a set where each element of the universe has a degree of truth, indeterminacy and falsity and it lies within]0−,1+[, the non-standard unit interval. Clearly this is the extension of the standard interval[0,1]. Furthermore, the uncertainty presented here, i.e. the indeterminacy factor, is dependent on the truth and falsity values, whereas the incorporated uncertainty is dependent on the degrees of belongingness and non-belongingness of IFSs [35]. Additionally, the aforementioned example of NSs can be expressed as x(0.5, 0.2, 0.6). However, without a specific description, NSs are difficult to apply to real-life situations. Therefore, single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) were proposed, which are an extension of NSs [31,35]. Majumdar et al. [35] introduced a measure of entropy of SVNSs. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients of SVNSs as well as a decision-making method using SVNSs were introduced [36]. In addition, Ye [37] also introduced the concept of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs), which can be described by three real numbers in the real unit interval [0,1], and proposed an MCDM method using the aggregation operators of SNSs. Wang et al. [38] and Lupiáñez [39] proposed the concept of interval neutrosophic sets (INSs) and provided the set-theoretic operators of INSs. Broumi and Smarandache [40] discussed the correlation coefficient of INSs and Zhang et al. [41] developed a MCDM method based on aggregation operators within an interval neutrosophic environment. Furthermore, Ye [42,43] proposed the similarity measures between SVNSs and INSs, which were based on the relationship between similarity measures and distances. However, in certain cases, the operations of SNSs provided by Ye [37] may be impractical. For example, the sum of any element and the maximum value should be equal to the maximum value, but this is not always the case during operations [37]. The similarity measures and distances of SVNSs that are based on those operations may also be unrealistic. Peng et al. [44] defined the novel operations and aggregation operators, which were based on the operations in Ye [37], and applied them to MCDM problems.Furthermore, the aforementioned methods using SNSs always involve operations and measures whose influence on the final solution may be significant. However, there is another method that can overcome these shortcomings, namely the relation model. Relation models utilize outranking relations or priority functions for ranking the alternatives in terms of their priority according to the criteria. Recently relation models have been widely acknowledged as they are more related to the actual decision-making process. The ELECTRE methods, which were originally developed by Benayoun and Roy [45,46] are typical of this field. Subsequently, ELECTRE I, II, III, IV, IS, and TRI [45–48] were developed, which are extensions of ELECTRE. To date, the ELECTRE methods have been successfully and widely used in various fields, including biological engineering [49,50], energy sources [51,52], environmental studies [53,54], economics [55], value engineering [56], medical science [57], communication and transportation [58], and location selection problems [59,60]. For example, Devi and Yadav [59] developed an MCDM method based on ELECTRE in order to solve plant location problems where the evaluation values are IFSs. Moreover, Hatami-Marbini and Tavana [61] proposed an extension of the ELECTRE I method to solve group decision-making problems within a fuzzy environment. Vahdani et al. [62] proposed a novel ELECTRE method to solve MCDM problems with interval weights and data. Vahdani and Hadipour [63] developed a novel ELECTRE method to solve MCDM problems with interval-valued fuzzy information. Yang et al. [64] proposed an outranking method for MCDM problems with duplex linguistic information. Yang and Wang [65] developed a decision aiding technique based on incomplete preference information and applied it to solve MCDM problems. Wang et al. [66,67] proposed outranking approaches to solve MCDM problems with HFSs and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. Chen [68] developed an ELECTRE outranking method to solve multiple criteria group decision-making problems with interval type-2 fuzzy sets.In this paper, the novel operations of SNSs are developed, some outranking relations of simplified neutrosophic numbers (SNNs) that are based on ELECTRE are proposed, and the rational properties of SNNs are discussed. Furthermore, an outranking approach for MCDM problems with SNNs is developed, which could overcome the drawbacks that were discussed earlier in the paper.The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the definition and novel operations of SNSs are provided. In Section 3, some outranking relations of SNNs that are based on ELECTRE are defined and some properties are discussed. In Section 4, an outranking approach for MCDM problems with SNNs is developed. Two worked examples appear in Section 5 and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.In this section, the definitions of NSs and SNSs are introduced in order to assist with the latter analysis.Definition 1[32]Let X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x. An NS A in X is characterized by a truth-membership functionTA(x), a indeterminacy-membership functionIA(x)and a falsity-membership functionFA(x).TA(x),IA(x)andFA(x)are real standard or nonstandard subsets of]0−,1+[, that is,TA(x):X→]0−,1+[,IA(x):X→]0−,1+[, andFA(x):X→]0−,1+[. There is no restriction on the sum ofTA(x),IA(x)andFA(x), therefore0−≤supTA(x)+supIA(x)+supFA(x)≤3+.An NS A is contained in another NS B, denoted byA⊆B, if and only ifinfTA(x)≤infTB(x),supTA(x)≤supTB(x),infIA(x)≥infIB(x),supIA(x)≥supIB(x),infFA(x)≥infFB(x)andsupFA(x)≥supFB(x)for anyx∈X.Since it is difficult to apply NSs to practical problems, Ye [37] reduced NSs of nonstandard intervals into the SNSs of standard intervals, which preserves the operations of NSs.Let X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x. An NS A in X is characterized byTA(x),IA(x)andFA(x), which are singleton subintervals/subsets in the real standard [0,1], that isTA(x):X→[0,1],IA(x):X→[0,1], andFA(x):X→[0,1]. Then, a simplification of A is denoted by:The operations of SNSs are also defined by Ye [37].Definition 4[37]Let A and B be two SNSs, the following operations can be true.(1)A+B={<x,TA(x)+TB(x)−TA(x)⋅TB(x),IA(x)+IB(x)−IA(x)⋅IB(x),FA(x)+FB(x)−FA(x)⋅FB(x)>|x∈X};A⋅B={<x,TA(x)⋅TB(x),IA(x)⋅IB(x),FA(x)⋅FB(x)>|x∈X};λ⋅A={<x,1−(1−TA(x))λ,1−(1−IA(x))λ,1−(1−FA(x))λ>|x∈X},λ>0;Aλ={<x,TAλ(x),IAλ(x),FAλ(x)>|x∈X},λ>0.Definition 4 has certain limitations and these are now outlined.(1) In some situations, operations such asA+BandA⋅Bmight be impractical. This is demonstrated in Example 1.Example 1LetA={<x,0.5,0.5,0.5>}andB={<x,1,0,0>}be two SNSs. Clearly,B={<x,1,0,0>}is the larger of these SNSs. Theoretically, the sum of any number and the maximum number should be equal to the maximum value. However, according to Definition 4,A+B={<x,1,0.5,0.5>}≠B, therefore the operation “+” cannot be accepted. Similar contradictions exist in other operations of Definition 4, and thus those defined above are incorrect.(2) The correlation coefficient of SNSs [36], which is based on the operations of Definition 4, cannot be accepted in some specific cases.Example 2LetA1={<x,0.8,0,0>}andA2={<x,0.7,0,0>}be two SNSs, andB={<x,1,0,0>}be the largest SNS. According to the correlation coefficient of SNSs [36],W1(A1,B)=W2(A2,B)=1can be obtained, but this does not indicate which one is the best. However, it is clear thatA1is superior toA2.(3) In addition, the cross-entropy measure for SNSs [42], which is based on the operations of Definition 4, cannot be accepted in specific cases.Example 3LetA1={<x,0.1,0,0>}andA2={<x,0.9,0,0>}be two SNSs, andB={<x,1,0,0>}be the largest SNS According to the cross-entropy measure for SNSs [42],S1(A1,B)=S2(A2,B)=1can be obtained, which indicates thatA1is equal toA2. However, it is not possible to discern which one is the best, but asTA2(x)>TA1(x),IA2(x)>IA1(x)andFA2(x)>FA1(x)for anyxinX, it is clear thatA2is superior toA1.(4) IfIA(x)=IB(x)for any x in X, then A and B are both reduced to two IFSs. However, the operations presented in Definition 4 are not in accordance with the operations of two IFSs [9–22].Definition 5[37]LetX={x1,x2,…,xn}and A and B be two SNSs, then A is contained in B, i.e.A⊆Bif and only ifTA(x)≤TB(x),IA(x)≥IB(x)andFA(x)≥FB(x)for anyx∈X.Clearly, if the equalities are not accepted, thenA⊂Bis obtained.Some novel operations of SNNs are now defined.Definition 6Let A and B be two SNNs, the operations of SNNs can be defined as follows:(1)λA=<1−(1−TA)λ,(IA)λ,(FA)λ>,λ>0;Aλ=<(TA)λ,1−(1−IA)λ,1−(1−FA)λ>,λ>0;A+B=<TA+TB−TA⋅TB,IA⋅IB,FA⋅FB>;A⋅B=<TA⋅TB,IA+IB−IA⋅IB,FA+FB−FA⋅FB>.Let A, B and C be three SNNs, then the following equations can be true.(1)A+B=B+A;A⋅B=B⋅A;λ(A+B)=λA+λB,λ>0;(A⋅B)λ=Aλ+Bλ,λ>0;λ1A+λ2A=(λ1+λ2)A,λ1>0,λ2>0;Aλ1⋅Aλ2=A(λ1+λ2),λ1>0,λ2>0;(A+B)+C=A+(B+C);(A⋅B)⋅C=A⋅(B⋅C).LetA=<0.6,0.1,0.2>andB=<0.5,0.3,0.4>be two SNNs, andλ=2, then the following results can be achieved:(1)2⋅A=<1−(1−0.6)2,0.12,0.22>=<0.84,0.01,0.04>;A2=<0.62,1−(1−0.1)2,1−(1−0.2)2>=<0.36,0.19,0.36>;A+B=<0.6+0.5−0.6×0.5,0.1×0.3,0.2×0.4>=<0.80,0.03,0.08>;A⋅B=<0.6×0.5,0.1+0.3−0.1×0.3,0.2+0.4−0.2×0.4>=<0.30,0.37,0.52>.LetA∈SNNS, then the complement of an SNN A is denoted byAC, which is defined byAC=<1−TA,1−IA,1−FA>.Let A and B be two SNNs, thenA=Bif and only ifA⊆BandB⊆A.Let A and B be any two SNNs, then the normalized Euclidean distance between A and B can be defined as follows:(2)d(A,B)=13n(|T˜A−T˜B|2+|I˜A−I˜B|2+|F˜A−F˜B|2).The binary relations between two SNNs that are based on ELECTRE are now defined.Definition 10Let A and B be two SNNs, then the strong dominance relation, weak dominance relation, and indifference relation of SNNs can be defined as follows.(1)IfTA≥TB,IA<IBandFA<FBorTA>TB,IA=IBandFA=FB, then A strongly dominates B (B is strongly dominated by A), denoted byA≻SB.IfTA≥TB,IA≥IBandFA<FBorTA≥TB,IA<IBandFA≥FB, then A weakly dominates B (B is weakly dominated by A), denoted byA≻WB.IfTA=TB,IA=IBandFA=FB, then A is indifferent to B, denoted byA∼IB.If none of the relations mentioned above exist between A and B for anyx∈X, then A and B are incomparable, denoted byA⊥B.LetA,B∈SNNS, then the following properties can be obtained:(1)ifB⊂A, thenA≻SB;ifA≻SB, thenB⊆A;A∼IBif and only ifA=B.(1) IfB⊂A, thenTB<TA,IB>IAandFB>FA.A≻SBis definitely validated according to the strong dominance relation in Definition 10.(2) IfA≻SB, then based on Definition 10,TA≥TB,IA<IBandFA<FBorTA>TB,IA=IBandFA=FBare realized. From Definition 5,B⊆Ais obtained.(3) Necessity:A∼IB⇒A=B.According to the indifference relation in Definition 10, it is known thatTA=TB,IA=IBandFA=FB. Clearly,A⊆BandB⊆Aare achieved, thenA=B.Sufficiency:A=B⇒A∼IB.IfA=B, then it is known thatA⊆BandB⊆A, which meansTA≤TB,IA≥IB,FA≥FBandTA≥TB,IA≤IBandFA≤FB; thenTA=TB,IA=IBandFA=FBare obtained. Due to the indifference relation in Definition 10,A∼IBis definitely validated.□Let A, B and C be three SNNs, ifA≻SBandB≻SC, thenA≻SC.According to the strong dominance relation in Definition 10, ifA≻SB, thenTA≥TB,IA<IBandFA<FBorTA>TB,IA=IBandFA=FB.IfB≻SC, thenTB≥TC,IB<ICandFB<FCorTB>TC,IB=ICandFB=FC.Therefore, the further derivations are:IfTA≥TB,IA<IBandFA<FBTB≥TC,IB<ICandFB<FC⇒TA≥TC,IA<ICandFA<FC,thenbasedonDefinition10,A≻SCisrealized.IfTA≥TB,IA<IBandFA<FBTB>TC,IB=ICandFB=FC⇒TA>TC,IA<ICandFA<FC,thenbasedonDefinition10,A≻SCisachieved.IfTA>TB,IA=IBandFA=FBTB≥TC,IB<ICandFB<FC⇒TA>TC,IA<ICandFA<FC,thenbasedonDefinition10,A≻SCisobtained.IfTA>TB,IA=IBandFA=FBTB≥TC,IB=ICandFB=FC⇒TA>TC,IA=ICandFA=FC,thenbasedonDefinition10,A≻SCisrealized.Therefore, ifA≻SBandB≻SC, thenA≻SC.□Let A, B and C be three SNNs, ifA∼IBandB∼IC, thenA∼IC.Clearly, ifA∼IBandB∼IC, thenA∼ICis surely validated.□Let A, B and C be three SNNs, then the following results can be achieved.(1)The strong dominance relations are categorized into:irreflexivity:∀A∈SNNS,A⊁SA;asymmetry:∀A,B∈SNNS,A≻SB⇒B⊁SA;transitivity:∀A,B,C∈SNNS,A≻SB,B≻SC⇒A≻SC.The weak dominance relations are categorized into:irreflexivity:∀A∈SNNS,A⊁WA;asymmetry:∀A,B∈SNNS,A≻WB⇒B⊁WA;non-transitivity:∃A,B,C∈SNNS,A≻WB,B≻wCA≻WC.The indifference relations are categorized into:reflexivity:∀A∈SNNS,A∼IA;symmetry:∀A,B∈SNNS,A∼IB⇒B∼IA;transitivity:∀A,B,C∈SNNS,A∼IB,B∼IC⇒A∼IC.According to Definition 10, it is clear that,,andare true, and,,,andneed to be proven.Example 5,,,andare exemplified as follows.(1)IfA=<0.6,0.3,0.2>is a SNN, thenA⊁SAcan be obtained.IfA=<0.7,0.2,0.4>andB=<0.5,0.3,0.5>are two SNNs, thenA≻SB, butB⊁SAis achieved.IfA=<0.5,0.2,0.3>is a SNS, thenA⊁WAis realized.IfA=<0.4,0.3,0.3>andB=<0.3,0.3,0.4>are two SNNs, thenA≻WBis obtained, howeverB⊁WA.IfA=<0.7,0.3,0.4>,B=<0.6,0.2,0.5>andC=<0.6,0.3,0.3>are three SNNs, thenA≻WBandB≻WCare achieved, howeverA⊥C.Leta1anda2be two actions, the performances for actionsa1anda2be in the form of SNNs, andP=S∪W∪Imean that “a1 is at least as good as a2”, then four situations may arise:(1)a1Pa2and nota2Pa1, that isa1≻Sa2ora1≻Wa2;a2Pa1and nota1Pa2, that isa2≻Sa1ora2≻Wa1;a1Pa2anda2Pa1, that isa1∼Ia2;nota1Pa2and nota2Pa1, that isa1⊥a2.The MCDM ranking/selection problems with simplified neutrosophic information consist of a group of alternatives, denoted byA={a1,a2,…,an}. Each alternative is evaluated based on criteria, denoted byC={c1,c2,…,cm}.aijis the value of alternativeaifor criterioncj, andaij(i=1,…,n;j=1,…,m)are in the form of SNNs. The corresponding weight iswj, wherewj∈[0,1]and∑j=1mwj=1. This method is suitable if the amount of decision-makers is small and they could evaluate these criteria in the form of SNNs. For convenience, the value ofaijis denoted byaij=<Tij,Iij,Fij>(i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m).This method is an integration of SNNs and the outranking method to manage the MCDM problems mentioned above. In general, there are benefit criteria and cost criteria in MCDM problems and the cost-type criterion values can be transformed into benefit-type criterion values as follows:(3)βij=aij,forbenefitcriterioncj(aij)c,forcostcriterioncj,(i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m).here(aij)cis the complement ofaijas defined in Definition 7.It is now feasible to develop a new approach for the MCDM problems mentioned above.Step 1. Transform the decision matrix.The SNN decision matrixR=(aij)n×mcan be transformed into a normalized SNN decision matrixR=(βij)n×mbased on Eq. (3).Step 2. Determine the weighted normalized matrix.According to the weight vector for the criteria, the weighted normalized decision matrix can be constructed using the following formula:(4)γij=βijwj,i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m.wherewjis the weight of the jth criterion with∑j=1mwj=1.Step 3. Determine the concordance and discordance set of subscripts.The concordance set of subscripts, which should satisfy the constraintaijPakj, is represented as:(5)Oik={j|aijPakj}(i,k=1,2,…,n).aijPakjrepresentsaij>Sakjoraij>Wakjoraij∼akj.The discordance set of subscripts for criteria is the complementary subset, therefore:(6)Dik=J−Oik.Step 4. Determine the concordance and discordance matrix.By using the weight vector w that is associated with the criteria, the concordance indexC(ai,ak)is represented as:(7)C(ai,ak)=∑j∈Oikwj.Thus, the concordance matrix C is:(8)C=−c12⋯c1nc21−⋯c2n⋯⋯⋯⋯cn1cn2⋯−.The discordance indexD(ai,ak)is represented as:(9)Dik=maxj∈Dikd(aij,akj)maxj∈Jd(aij,akj).hered(aij,akj)denotes the normalized Euclidean distance betweenaijandakjas defined in Definition 9.Thus, the discordance matrix D is:(10)D=−d12⋯d1nd21−⋯d2n⋯⋯⋯⋯dn1dn2⋯−.Step 5. Determine the effective concordance and discordance matrix.Given a preference threshold valuep˜, which could judge the possible superiority ofaiwith respect toak, then the effective concordance matrix is represented as:(11)σ(ai,as)=1:IfC(ai,ak)≥p˜0:IfC(ai,ak)<p˜,wherep˜can be determined according to the decision-makers’ preference, andp˜=∑i=1n∑k=1nC(ai,ak)/n(n−1).Similarly, given a veto threshold valuev˜, which could judge the possible inferiority ofaiwith respect toak, then the effective discordance matrix is represented as:(12)δ(ai,ak)=1:IfD(ai,ak)≥v˜0:IfD(ai,ak)<v˜,wherev˜can be determined by the decision-makers, andv˜=∑i=1n∑k=1nD(ai,ak)/n(n−1).Step 6. Determine the outranking matrix.Subsequently the outranking matrix is defined with the following formula.(13)π(ai,ak)=σ(ai,ak)⋅δ(ai,ak).Step 7. Eliminate the less attractiveness alternatives and rank the alternatives.The outranking matrixπindicates the partial preference ordering of the alternatives. Ifπik=1, thenaiis preferred toAkfor both concordance and discordance indexes. However,aistill has a chance of being dominated by other alternatives. Therefore, the condition which makesaian effective alternative is as follows:(14)πik=1foratleastoneunitelementfork=1,2,…,n;i≠kπhi=0forallhforh=1,2,…,n;h≠i;h≠k.If any column of the matrixπ=(πij)has at least one element of 1, then this column is dominated by the corresponding row. Thus, any column which has an element of 1 can be eliminated. The threshold valuesp˜andv˜, which were given in Step 5, are approximate and influence the final ranking. Thus the best alternative can be obtained by changing the threshold value.In this section, an example for a MCDM problem with simplified neutrosophic information and an example for a MCDM problem with intuitionistic fuzzy information are used to demonstrate the application of the proposed decision-making method, as well as for the comparison analysis.Example 6[37]There is an investment company, which wants to invest a sum of money in the best option. This company has set up a panel which has to choose between four possible alternatives for investing the money: (1)a1is a car company; (2)a2is a food company; (3)a3is a computer company; and (4)a4is an arms company. The investment company must make a decision using the following three criteria: (1)c1is the risk; (2)c2is the growth; and (3)c3is the customer satisfaction; these are all benefit type criteria. The weight vector of the criteria is represented byw=(0.35,0.25,0.4). The four possible alternatives are to be evaluated under the above three criteria in the form of SNNs for each decision-maker, as shown in the following simplified neutrosophic decision matrix R:R=<0.4,0.2,0.3><0.4,0.2,0.3><0.8,0.8,0.5><0.6,0.1,0.2><0.6,0.1,0.2><0.5,0.8,0.8><0.3,0.2,0.3><0.5,0.2,0.3><0.5,0.7,0.8><0.7,0.0,0.1><0.6,0.1,0.2><0.6,0.7,0.8>.The procedures for obtaining the best alternative are now outlined.Step1. Transform the decision matrix.Since all the criteria are of the benefit type,R′=Rcan be obtained.Step 2. Determine the weighted normalized matrix.Based on Eq. (4), the weighted normalized matrixR″can be obtained.R″=<0.1637,0.6687,0.6178><0.1637,0.6687,0.6178><0.4307,0.9457,0.7579><0.2744,0.5623,0.5253><0.2744,0.5623,0.5253><0.2154,0.9457,0.9146><0.1174,0.6687,0.6178><0.2154,0.6687,0.6178><0.2154,0.9147,0.9146><0.3439,0.0000,0.3981><0.2744,0.5623,0.5253><0.2744,0.9147,0.9146>.Step 3. Determine the concordance and discordance set of subscripts.According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the concordance set of subscripts is obtained as follows:O12={3};O21={1,2};O31={2};O41={1,2};O13={1,3};O23={1,2};O32={3};O42={1,2,3};O14={3};O24={2};O34=∅;O43={1,2,3}.The discordance set of subscripts is obtained as follows:D12={1,2};D21={3};D31={1,3};D41={3};D13={2};D23={3};D32={1,2};D42=∅;D14={1,2};D24={1,3};D34={1,2,3};D43=∅.where∅denotes “empty”.Step 4. Determine the concordance and discordance matrix.With regard to the weight vector w associated with the criteria, the concordance index is represented as follows:C=−0.400.750.400.60−0.600.250.250.40−00.6011−.The discordance index can be calculated as follows. For example,D2,3=max{d(a23,a33)}max{d(a21,a31),d(a22,a32),d(a23,a33)}=max{0.0179}max{0.1218,0.0882,0.0179}=0.01790.01218=0.1472.Here:d(a21,a31)=13((0.2744−0.1174)2+(0.5623−0.6687)2+(0.5253−0.6178)2)1/2=0.1218;d(a22,a32)=13((0.2744−0.2154)2+(0.5623−0.6687)2+(0.5253−0.6178)2)1/2=0.0882;andd(a21,a31)=13((0.2154−0.2154)2+(0.9457−0.9147)2+(0.9146−0.9146)2)1/2=0.0179.Therefore, the discordance index matrix is as follows:D=−0.67300.192811−0.1472111−10.307700−.Step 5. Determine the effective concordance and discordance matrix.According to Eq. (11), the preference threshold valuep˜can be obtained.p˜=∑i=14∑k=14C(ai,ak)4×(4−1)=0.5208.Thus, the effective concordance matrix can be obtained as follows.σ=σ(ai,ak)=−0101−1000−0111−.Similarly, the veto threshold valuev˜and the effective discordance matrix are calculated as follows.v˜=∑i=14∑k=14D(ai,ak)4×(4−1)=0.6101,δ=(δ(ai,ak))=−1011−0111−1000−.Step 6. Determine the outranking matrix.Based on Step 5 and Eq. (13), the outranking matrix is calculated as follows.π=(π(ai,ak))=(σ(ai,ak))⋅(δ(ai,ak))=−0101−1000−0111−⋅−1011−0111−1000−=−0001−0000000000.Step 7. Eliminate the less favorable alternatives and rank the alternatives.In matrixπ, the first column has a unit element and can be eliminated. Subsequently alternativea2is placed in the first order anda1is placed in the fourth order. Furthermore, if the threshold valuesp˜andv˜are changed in Step 5, then it can be seen thata4is placed in the second order anda3is placed in the third order. Therefore the final ranking isa2≻a4≻a3≻a1. Thus, the best alternative isa2whereas the worst alternative isa1.It should be noted that an SNS is a special case of an NS, and an NS is a set where each element of the universe has the degrees of truth, indeterminacy and falsity, which lie within]0−,1+[, the non-standard unit interval. This is an extension of the standard interval[0,1]as discussed by Ye [36,37,42]. In particular, the uncertainty presented here, i.e. the indeterminacy factor, is independent of truth and falsity values, whereas the incorporated uncertainty is dependent on the degree of belongingness and non-belongingness of IFSs [35]. Therefore, this leads to the theory that IFSs are a special case of SNSs. Moreover, SNSs can solve some problems that are beyond the scope of FSs and IFSs, as was discussed earlier. The proposed MCDM approach with simplified neutrosophic information can also solve MCDM problems with intuitionistic information. Therefore an intuitionistic fuzzy problem is presented, which can be solved by utilizing the proposed approach. Furthermore a comparison analysis is made with other IFS methods.Example 7[15,69]The arrival of the mobile phone and its rapid and widespread growth may well be seen as one of the most significant developments in the fields of communication and information technology over the past two decades. A decision-maker wants to buy the mobile phone that is the best option. There are five possible mobile phonesaj(j=1,2,3)to be evaluated. The decision-maker must make a decision according to the following six criteria: (1)c1(basic requirements): reasonable price and a standard process applied; (2)c2(physical characteristics): design standards, weight, dimension, shape, water resistance, and raw material properties; (3)c3(technical features): talk time, standby time, and safety standards;c4(functionality): ease of use;c5(brand choice): market vision and technical support; andc6(customer excitement): games, diversity of ring tones, and business life facilitating services. The weight vector of the criteria is given byw=(0.2,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1). The five possible alternatives are to be evaluated under the above six criteria in the form of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, as shown in the following intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix R:R=<0.4,0.2,0.4><0.5,0.3,0.2><0.6,0.1,0.3><0.8,0.1,0.1><0.3,0.4,0.3><0.4,0.6,0.0><0.9,0.1,0.0><0.2,0.4,0.4><0.5,0.4,0.1><0.3,0.5,0.5><0.6,0.3,0.1><0.4,0.4,0.2><0.6,0.2,0.2><0.7,0.2,0.1><0.2,0.5,0.3><0.4,0.5,0.1><0.8,0.2,0.0><0.3,0.5,0.2>.In the following overview, the proposed decision-making approach is used to deal with intuitionsitic fuzzy information but the computation process is omitted. If the developed outranking decision-making method in Section 4 is used, the final outranking matrix is calculated as follows:π=(π(ai,ak))=(σ(ai,ak))⋅(δ(ai,ak))=−110−111−⋅−011−110−=−010−110−.Then the final ranking isa2≻a1≻a3. Therefore the best alternative isa2, whereas the worst alternative isa3.In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed decision-making method, a comparative study was conducted with other methods. The comparison analysis includes two cases. One is the other methods that were outlined in Ye [36,37,42], which are compared to the proposed method using simplified neutrosophic information. In the other, some of the methods that were introduced in Liu and Wang [9], Pei and Zheng [10], Zeng and Su [12], Xu [13] and Ye [36,37,42] are compared with the proposed approach using intuitionistic fuzzy information.Case 1. The proposed approach is compared with some methods using simplified neutrosophic information.With regard to the three methods in Ye [36,37,42], some aggregation operators were developed in order to aggregate the simplified neutrosophic information first; then the cosine similarity measure, the correlation coefficient and the weighted cross-entropy between each alternative and the ideal alternative were calculated and used to determine the final ranking order of all the alternatives. If the methods in Ye [36,37,42] and the proposed method are utilized to solve the MCDM problem in Example 6, then the results can be obtained and are shown in Table 1.According to the results presented in Table 1, if the methods of [36,37] are used, then the best alternative isa4while the worst alternative isa1. If the proposed approach and the method of Ye [42] are used, then the best alternative isa2while the worst alternative isa1. It can be seen that the result of the proposed approach is different from those that use the earlier methods of Ye [36,37], but is the same as that which uses Ye's later method [42]. There are a number of reasons why differences exist in the final rankings of all the compared methods and the proposed approach. Firstly, the measures and aggregation operators that are involved in those methods are related to some impractical operations as was discussed in Examples 1–3. Secondly, these different measures and aggregation operators also lead to different rankings and it is very difficult for decision-makers to confirm their judgments when using operators and measures that have similar characteristics and which always need a large amount of computation. Finally, the aggregation values, correlation coefficients and cross-entropy measures of SNSs were obtained firstly in Ye [36,37,42] and the differences were amplified in the final results due to the use of criteria weights.Case 2. The proposed approach is compared with some methods using intuitionistic fuzzy information.For the two methods used in Liu and Wang [9] and Pei and Zheng [10], the novel score function and the accuracy function of IFSs were developed and the best alternatives were obtained based on the values of these two functions. For the other two methods used in Zeng and Su [12] and Xu [13], the different distances between each alternative and the ideal solution were obtained and determined the final ranking order of all alternatives. If the four methods presented above and the methods in Ye [36,37,42] are all utilized to solve the MCDM problem in Example 7, then they will produce different results as seen in Table 2.According to the results presented in Table 2, if the methods of Liu and Wang [9], Pei and Zheng [10] and Xu [13] and the proposed approach are utilized to solve MCDM problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information, then the best alternative is alwaysa2whereas the worst alternative isa1ora3. If the method of Zeng and Su [12] is used, then the final ranking isa3≻a2≻a1and the best alternative isa3. However, the best alternative is alwaysa2if the methods of Ye [36,37,42] are used. When compared with the methods that use intuitionistic fuzzy information, it can be seen that the result of the proposed approach is the same as those using the methods of Liu and Wang [9], Pei and Zheng [10] and Xu [13], but different from that using the method of Zeng and Su [12]. Moreover, the results of Ye [36,37,42] are different from those using all of the compared methods and the proposed approach. Three reasons can be put forward in order to explain these differences. Firstly, the results using the MCDM method with simplified neutrosophic information and those utilizing the MCDM method with intuitionistic fuzzy information are not the same. The main reason for this is that the operations of SNSs are different from those of the IFSs, which cannot satisfy the operations of the indeterminacy-membership degree of SNSs. Secondly, although those MCDM methods that use intuitionistic information were constructed using reliable theories and may be robust to a certain degree, they have a number of defects as those methods utilize a different score function, accuracy function, aggregation operators and distance, which also lead to different rankings. Finally, the impractical operations of Ye's [36,37,42] methods that were discussed earlier, and form part of those methods can, to a great extent, explain the differences that exist in the final rankings.From the analysis presented above, it can be concluded that the main advantages of the approach developed in this paper over the other methods are not only due to its ability to effectively overcome the shortcomings of the compared methods, but also due to its ability to manage the preference information that is expressed by SNSs and IFSs. This means that it can avoid losing and distorting the preference information provided which makes the final results better correspond with real life decision-making problems.
