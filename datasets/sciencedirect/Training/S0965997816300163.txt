@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are becoming more and more popular in engineering applications because they: (i) rely on rather simple concepts and are easy to implement; (ii) do not require gradient information; (iii) can bypass local optima; (iv) can be utilized in a wide range of problems covering different disciplines.Nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms solve optimization problems by mimicking biological or physical phenomena. They can be grouped in three main categories (see Fig. 1): evolution-based, physics-based, and swarm-based methods. Evolution-based methods are inspired by the laws of natural evolution. The search process starts with a randomly generated population which is evolved over subsequent generations. The strength point of these methods is that the best individuals are always combined together to form the next generation of individuals. This allows the population to be optimized over the course of generations. The most popular evolution-inspired technique is Genetic Algorithms (GA) [1] that simulates the Darwinian evolution. Other popular algorithms are Evolution Strategy (ES) [110], Probability-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) [111], Genetic Programming (GP) [2], and Biogeography-Based Optimizer (BBO) [3].Physics-based methods imitate the physical rules in the universe. The most popular algorithms are Simulated Annealing (SA) [4,5], Gravitational Local Search (GLSA) [6], Big-Bang Big-Crunch (BBBC) [7], Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [8], Charged System Search (CSS) [9], Central Force Optimization (CFO) [10], Artificial Chemical Reaction Optimization Algorithm (ACROA) [11], Black Hole (BH) [12] algorithm, Ray Optimization (RO) [13] algorithm, Small-World Optimization Algorithm (SWOA) [14], Galaxy-based Search Algorithm (GbSA) [15], and Curved Space Optimization (CSO) [16].The third group of nature-inspired methods includes swarm-based techniques that mimic the social behavior of groups of animals. The most popular algorithm is Particle Swarm Optimization, originally developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [17]. PSO is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. It uses a number of particles (candidate solutions) which fly around in the search space to find the best solution (i.e. the optimal position). Meanwhile, they all trace the best location (best solution) in their paths. In other words, particles consider their own best solutions as well as the best solution the swarm has obtained so far. Another popular swarm-based algorithm is Ant Colony Optimization, first proposed by Dorigo et al. [18]. This algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of ants in an ant colony. In fact, the social intelligence of ants in finding the closest path from the nest and a source of food is the main inspiration of this algorithm. A pheromone matrix is evolved over the course of iteration by the candidate solutions.Other swarm-based techniques are listed in Table 1. This class of meta-heuristic methods started to be attractive since PSO was proven to be very competitive with evolution-based and physical-based algorithms. Generally speaking, swarm-based algorithms have some advantages over evolution-based algorithms. For example, swarm-based algorithms preserve search space information over subsequent iterations while evolution-based algorithms discard any information as soon as a new population is formed. They usually include less operators compared to evolutionary approaches (selection, crossover, mutation, elitism, etc.) and hence are easier to implement.It is worth mentioning here that there are also other meta-heuristic methods inspired by human behaviors in the literature. Some of the most popular algorithms are Teaching Learning Based Optimization(TLBO) [36,37], Harmony Search (HS) [38], Tabu (Taboo) Search (TS) [39–41], Group Search Optimizer (GSO) [42,43], Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) [44], League Championship Algorithm (LCA) [45,46], Firework Algorithm [47], Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) [48,49], Interior Search Algorithm (ISA) [50], Mine Blast Algorithm (MBA) [51], Soccer League Competition (SLC) algorithm [52,53], Seeker Optimization Algorithm (SOA) [54], Social-Based Algorithm (SBA) [55], Exchange Market Algorithm (EMA) [56], and Group Counseling Optimization (GCO) algorithm [57,58].Population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithms share a common feature regardless of their nature. The search process is divided into two phases: exploration and exploitation [59–61]. The optimizer must include operators to globally explore the search space: in this phase, movements (i.e. perturbation of design variables) should be randomized as most as possible. The exploitation phase follows the exploration phase and can be defined as the process of investigating in detail the promising area(s) of the search space. Exploitation hence pertains to the local search capability in the promising regions of design space found in the exploration phase. Finding a proper balance between exploration and exploitation is the most challenging task in the development of any meta-heuristic algorithm due to the stochastic nature of the optimization process.This study describes a new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm (namely, Whale Optimization Algorithm, WOA) mimicking the hunting behavior of humpback whales. To the knowledge of the present authors, there is no previous study on this subject in the optimization literature. The main difference between the current work and the recently published papers by the authors (particularly GWO [62]) is the simulated hunting behavior with random or the best search agent to chase the prey and the use of a spiral to simulate bubble-net attacking mechanism of humpback whales. The efficiency of the WOA algorithm developed in this research is evaluated by solving 29 mathematical optimization problems and six structural optimization problems. Optimization results demonstrate that WOA is very competitive compared to the state-of-the-art optimization methods.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the Whale Optimization Algorithm developed in this study. Test problems and optimization results are presented and discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively, for mathematical functions and structural optimization problems. Section 5 summarizes the main findings of this study and suggests directions for future research.In this section the inspiration of the proposed method is first discussed. Then, the mathematical model is provided.Whales are fancy creatures. They are considered as the biggest mammals in the world. An adult whale can grow up to 30m long and 180t weight. There are 7 different main species of this giant mammal such killer, Minke, Sei, humpback, right, finback, and blue. Whales are mostly considered as predators. They never sleep because they have to breathe from the surface of oceans. In fact, half of the brain only sleeps. The interesting thing about the whales is that they are considered as highly intelligent animals with emotion.According to Hof and Van Der Gucht [63], whales have common cells in certain areas of their brains similar to those of human called spindle cells. These cells are responsible for judgment, emotions, and social behaviors in humans. In other words the spindle cells make us distinct from other creatures. Whales have twice number of these cells than an adult human which is the main cause of their smartness. It has been proven that whale can think, learn, judge, communicate, and become even emotional as a human does, but obviously with a much lower level of smartness. It has been observed that whales (mostly killer whales) are able to develop their own dialect as well.Another interesting point is the social behavior of whales. They live alone or in groups. However, they are mostly observed in groups. Some of their species (killer whales for instance) can live in a family over their entire life period. One of the biggest baleen whales is humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). An adult humpback whale is almost as size of a school bus. Their favorite prey are krill and small fish herds. Fig. 2shows this mammal.The most interesting thing about the humpback whales is their special hunting method. This foraging behavior is called bubble-net feeding method [64]. Humpback whales prefer to hunt school of krill or small fishes close to the surface. It has been observed that this foraging is done by creating distinctive bubbles along a circle or ‘9’-shaped path as shown in Fig. 2. Before 2011, this behavior was only investigated based on the observation from surface. However, Goldbogen et al. [65] investigated this behavior utilizing tag sensors. They captured 300 tag-derived bubble-net feeding events of 9 individual humpback whales. They found two maneuvers associated with bubble and named them ‘upward-spirals’ and ‘double-loops’. In the former maneuver, humpback whales dive around 12m down and then start to create bubble in a spiral shape around the prey and swim up toward the surface. The later maneuver includes three different stages: coral loop, lobtail, and capture loop. Detailed information about these behaviors can be found in [65].It is worth mentioning here that bubble-net feeding is a unique behavior that can only be observed in humpback whales. In this work the spiral bubble-net feeding maneuver is mathematically modeled in order to perform optimization.In this section the mathematical model of encircling prey, spiral bubble-net feeding maneuver, and search for prey is first provided. The WOA algorithm is then proposed.Humpback whales can recognize the location of prey and encircle them. Since the position of the optimal design in the search space is not known a priori, the WOA algorithm assumes that the current best candidate solution is the target prey or is close to the optimum. After the best search agent is defined, the other search agents will hence try to update their positions towards the best search agent. This behavior is represented by the following equations:(2.1)D→=|C→.X*→(t)−X→(t)|(2.2)X→(t+1)=X*→(t)−A→·D→where t indicates the current iteration,A→andC→are coefficient vectors, X* is the position vector of the best solution obtained so far,X→is the position vector, | | is the absolute value, and · is an element-by-element multiplication. It is worth mentioning here that X* should be updated in each iteration if there is a better solution.The vectorsA→andC→are calculated as follows:(2.3)A→=2a→·r→−a→(2.4)C→=2·r→wherea→is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations (in both exploration and exploitation phases) andr→is a random vector in [0,1].Fig. 3(a) illustrates the rationale behind Eq. (2.2) for a 2D problem. The position (X,Y) of a search agent can be updated according to the position of the current best record (X*,Y*). Different places around the best agent can be achieved with respect to the current position by adjusting the value ofA→andC→vectors. The possible updating position of a search agent in 3D space is also depicted in Fig. 3(b). It should be noted that by defining the random vector (r→) it is possible to reach any position in the search space located between the key-points shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, Eq. (2.2) allows any search agent to update its position in the neighborhood of the current best solution and simulates encircling the prey.The same concept can be extended to a search space with n dimensions, and the search agents will move in hyper-cubes around the best solution obtained so far. As mentioned in the previous section, the humpback whales also attack the prey with the bubble-net strategy. This method is mathematically formulated as follows:In order to mathematically model the bubble-net behavior of humpback whales, two approaches are designed as follows:1Shrinking encircling mechanism: This behavior is achieved by decreasing the value ofa→in the Eq. (2.3). Note that the fluctuation range ofA→is also decreased bya→. In other wordsA→is a random value in the interval [−a,a] where a is decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations. Setting random values forA→in [−1,1], the new position of a search agent can be defined anywhere in between the original position of the agent and the position of the current best agent. Fig. 4(a) shows the possible positions from (X,Y) towards (X*,Y*) that can be achieved by 0≤A≤1 in a 2D space.Spiral updating position: As can be seen in Fig. 4(b), this approach first calculates the distance between the whale located at (X,Y) and prey located at (X*,Y*). A spiral equation is then created between the position of whale and prey to mimic the helix-shaped movement of humpback whales as follows:(2.5)X→(t+1)=D′→·ebl·cos(2πl)+X*→(t)whereD′→=|X*→(t)−X→(t)|and indicates the distance of the ith whale to the prey (best solution obtained so far), b is a constant for defining the shape of the logarithmic spiral, l is a random number in [−1,1], and . is an element-by-element multiplication.Note that humpback whales swim around the prey within a shrinking circle and along a spiral-shaped path simultaneously. To model this simultaneous behavior, we assume that there is a probability of 50% to choose between either the shrinking encircling mechanism or the spiral model to update the position of whales during optimization. The mathematical model is as follows:(2.6)X→(t+1)={X*→(t)−A→·D→ifp<0.5D′→·ebl·cos(2πl)+X*→(t)ifp≥0.5where p is a random number in [0,1].In addition to the bubble-net method, the humpback whales search for prey randomly. The mathematical model of the search is as follows.The same approach based on the variation of theA→vector can be utilized to search for prey (exploration). In fact, humpback whales search randomly according to the position of each other. Therefore, we useA→with the random values greater than 1 or less than −1 to force search agent to move far away from a reference whale. In contrast to the exploitation phase, we update the position of a search agent in the exploration phase according to a randomly chosen search agent instead of the best search agent found so far. This mechanism and |A→|>1 emphasize exploration and allow the WOA algorithm to perform a global search. The mathematical model is as follows:(2.7)D→=|C→·Xrand→−X→|(2.8)X→(t+1)=Xrand→−A→.D→whereXrand→is a random position vector (a random whale) chosen from the current population.Some of the possible positions around a particular solution withA→>1are depicted in Fig. 5.The WOA algorithm starts with a set of random solutions. At each iteration, search agents update their positions with respect to either a randomly chosen search agent or the best solution obtained so far. The a parameter is decreased from 2 to 0 in order to provide exploration and exploitation, respectively. A random search agent is chosen when |A→|>1, while the best solution is selected when |A→|<1 for updating the position of the search agents. Depending on the value of p, WOA is able to switch between either a spiral or circular movement. Finally, the WOA algorithm is terminated by the satisfaction of a termination criterion.The pseudo code of the WOA algorithm is presented in Fig. 6.From theoretical stand point, WOA can be considered a global optimizer because it includes exploration/exploitation ability. Furthermore, the proposed hyper-cube mechanism defines a search space in the neighborhood of the best solution and allows other search agents to exploit the current best record inside that domain. Adaptive variation of the search vector A allows the WOA algorithm to smoothly transit between exploration and exploitation: by decreasing A, some iterations are devoted to exploration (|A|≥1) and the the rest is dedicated to exploitation (|A|<1). Remarkably, WOA includes only two main internal parameters to be adjusted (A and C).Although mutation and other evolutionary operations might have been included in the WOA formulation to fully reproduce the behavior of humpback whales, we decided to minimize the amount of heuristics and the number of internal parameters thus implementing a very basic version of the WOA algorithm. However, hybridization with evolutionary search schemes may be the subject of future studies
