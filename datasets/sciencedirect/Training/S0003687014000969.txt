Evaluation of team lifting on work demands, workload and workers' evaluation: An observational field study

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The mass limit of 25kg per person is regularly violated when team lifting must be applied.Load mass is not the main determinant for the appropriate number of workers during lifting.Work demands are not different when handling loads up to 50kg or up to 100kg.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The objective of this study was to assess differences in work demands, energetic workload and workers’ discomfort and physical effort in two regularly observable workdays in ironwork; one where loads up to 50kg were handled with two persons manually (T50) and one where loads up to 100kg were handled manually with four persons (T100). Differences between these typical workdays were assessed with an observational within-subject field study of 10 ironworkers. No significant differences were found for work demands, energetic workload or discomfort between T50 and T100 workdays. During team lifts, load mass exceeded 25kg per person in 57% (T50 workday) and 68% (T100 workday) of the lifts. Seven ironworkers rated team lifting with two persons as less physically demanding compared with lifting with four persons. When loads heavier than 25kg are lifted manually with a team, regulations of the maximum mass weight are frequently violated.Statement of relevanceLoads heavier than 25kg are frequently lifted during concrete reinforcement work and should be lifted by a team of persons. However, the field study showed that loads above 25kg are most of the time not lifted with the appropriate number of workers. Therefore, loads heavier than 25kg should be lifted mechanically.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
From a health perspective, several threshold limits have been proposed for the safe manual lifting of loads (e.g., Jäger and Luttmann, 1991; Leamon, 1994; Waters et al., 1993). One profession in which manual material handling (MMH) frequently occurs is concrete reinforcement work (Buchholz et al., 2003; Paquet et al., 2005; Saari and Wickström, 1978; Vi, 2006). At work sites, concrete is reinforced with iron bars or lattices placed and tied together by ironworkers. The weight of the iron bars varies from less than 1kg to approximately 50kg (Buchholz et al., 2003; Saari and Wickström, 1978), and the weight of pre-assembled iron lattices can even exceed 100kg, depending on the size of the iron lattices and the diameter of the iron bars of the lattices.In the Dutch construction industry, the maximum weight limit is set at 25kg under ideal manual lifting circumstances (Arbouw, 1997), loads heavier than 25g should be lifted mechanically. Due to organisational, technical and economical limitations, mechanical lifting of loads heavier than 25kg is not always feasible. In these situations, the load is lifted manually with more workers to comply with the maximum weight limit of 25kg in the Dutch construction industry. Lifting a load with additional persons is called team lifting and is a frequently used method when weight exceeds the individual threshold limits for safe MMH (Barrett and Dennis, 2005; Marras et al., 1999; Sharp et al., 1997). This implies that within reinforcement work, work settings occur in which ironworkers are allowed to lift upto 50kg with two persons manually (Dutch Labour Inspectorate, 2008) and consequently settings in which lifts upto 100kg with four persons are allowed.Previous research on team lifting has mainly focused on its effect on the Maximal Acceptable Weight of Lift (MAWL) (Mital and Motorwala, 1995; Lee and Lee, 2001, Sharp et al., 1997) and biomechanical compression force at the lumbar spine (Dennis and Barrett 2002; Marras et al. 1999). While two studies found a team MAWL between 85% and 90% of the sum of individual MAWL for team lifts with 2–4 persons (Lee and Lee, 2001; Sharp et al., 1997), another study found a team MAWL of 112% (Mital and Motorwala, 1995). Despite these conflicting results, it is generally assumed that team MAWL is less than the sum of individual MAWL (Dennis and Barrett, 2003). The studies that focused on the biomechanical load at the low back found a decrease (660–1000N) in compression force on the lower back during two-persons lifts compared to individual lifts given a fixed load per person (Dennis and Barrett, 2002; Marras et al., 1999). The biomechanical load of team lifts with more than two persons were not subject of these studies. However, team lifting seems beneficial to reduce the biomechanical compression force on the lower back.All of the previously mentioned studies on team lifting were performed in a laboratory and focused on the intensity of team lifting. However, the frequency and duration of lifting tasks are also important for quantifying daily exposure to physically demanding activities at work (Waters et al., 1993, Winkel and Mathiassen, 1994; Van der Beek and Frings-Dresen, 1998, Kuijer et al., 2012). Although team lifting seems beneficial to reduce workload, it is unclear how often and in what way team lifting is performed in practice on work sites when loads upto 50kg or upto 100kg are lifted manually. Because aspects other than weight may influence team lifting, we also wanted to learn from the experiences of workers who perform team lifting with two or more persons.The aim of the present study is to establish the work demands and workload among ironworkers performing concrete reinforcement work between usual workdays at which two workers, in accordance with the policy of the Dutch Labour Inspectorate, lift loads up to 50kg and usual workdays at which four workers lift loads up to 100kg. Work demands and workload were assessed in terms of (1) frequency and duration of tasks and activities, (2) lifting characteristics, (3) energetic workload, (4) perceived discomfort of body regions and (5) perceived physical effort.
