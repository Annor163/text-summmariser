@&#ABSTRACT@&#
It is well known that he influence relation orders the voters the same way as the classical Banzhaf and Shapley–Shubik indices do when they are extended to the voting games with abstention (VGA) in the class of complete games. Moreover, all hierarchies for the influence relation are achievable in the class of complete VGA. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that all hierarchies are achievable in a subclass of weighted VGA, the class of weighted games for which a single weight is assigned to voters. Secondly, we conduct a partial study of achievable hierarchies within the subclass of H-complete games, that is, complete games under stronger versions of influence relation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In a committee, a voting rule specifies the decision-making procedure, that is, when a proposal is to be accepted or rejected depending on the resulting vote configuration. The vote configuration itself depends on different options offered to committee members. A very huge class of voting rules studied in the literature deals with simple games. In such voting models, any voter either votes for or against the proposal. If a voter does not favor a proposal, then he is considered to be against, that is, an abstention if any, is treated as a vote against the proposal. It is well known however that many decision-making processes including relative majority, vote in the United Nations Senate cannot be fitted in such models.To handle this shortcoming, models of voting games with abstention (VGA) were introduced (Rubinstein (1980) defined social decision systems, Felsenthal and Machover (1997, 1998) defined Ternary Voting Game), where each player is allowed three distinct votes but the outcome of the vote still has two options. An important but isolated earlier work on abstention can be found in Fishburn’s book Fishburn (1973). More recently, Freixas and Zwicker (2003) extended VGAs to the so-called(j,k)games, a subclass of which are(j,2)games in which voters have j possible ordered levels of approval in the input, thus partitioning the committee N into j coalitions, each attached to a winning or losing character in the output. Simple games constitute the class of(2,2)simple games whereas VGAs constitute the class of(3,2)simple games.A fundamental question is the assessment of the influence of each voter to affect the outcome of a vote. Several power indices for simple games have so far been defined to capture the ability of the players to affect the voting outcome. The two most conspicuous representatives of this line of research are the Shapley–Shubik (SS) power index (Shapley & Shubik, 1954) and the Banzhaf and Coleman (BC) power indices (Banzhaf, 1965; Coleman, 1971) originally defined in voting rules modeled by simple games. In a quite distinct direction, the desirability relation (introduced by Isbell (1958) and extensively studied by Taylor (1995)) rank directly players according to their influence. Previous work by Felsenthal and Machover (1997) and Diffo Lambo and Moulen (2002) show that all these power theories are ordinally equivalent in the class of swap-robust simple games.In order to capture the ordering of the influence held by the players in a game, the concept of hierarchy was introduced by Friedman, McGrath, and Parker (2006). For example, a five-player game G has hierarchy(1,3,1)means that one player has less influence than all the others, one player has more, and the other three players have the same influence as each other, they are equivalent. From works by Friedman et al. (2006) and Freixas and Pons (2010) on hierarchies, it can be stated that given any complete pre-ordering defined on a finite set of more than 5 voters, it is possible to construct a simple game such that the pre-orderings induced by Shapley and Shubik (1954), and Banzhaf (1965) and Coleman (1971) power indices coincide with the given pre-ordering (when the number of voters is 5 or less, there are four non achievable hierarchies). These results hold under the condition that the game be modeled by a simple game. With respect to the construction of the hierarchies, recently, Bishnu and Roy (2012) have shown how to use minimal winning coalitions to extract the hierarchy of players.This paper deals with voting games with abstention. The question of achievable hierarchies is relevant thanks to the fact that SS and BC indices have all been clearly generalized to VGA by Felsenthal and Machover (1997) while the Coleman index has been generalized to VGA by Freixas (2012). They have moreover been generalized to the most general model of(j,k)games by Freixas (2005a, 2005b). On the other hand, the desirability relation has been defined by Tchantcho, Diffo Lambo, Pongou, and Mbama Engoulou (2008) in terms of I-influence relation. These authors showed that the SS, BC and the I-influence relation are ordinally equivalent in the subclass of equitable swap-robust games. Recently, Parker (2012) showed that this ordinal equivalence holds in the whole class of swap-robust games.With respect to hierarchies, we show in this paper that all hierarchies are achievable. More precisely, the four hierarchies cited above that were not achievable for simple games (when abstentions are not permitted to players) are achievable in a particular class of weighted games, the class of zero-centered strongly weighted VGA. This is a refinement of Parker’s result Parker (2012). Weighted games as well as the characterization of this class of games were given by Freixas and Zwicker in Freixas and Zwicker (2003).Freixas, Tchantcho, and Tedjeugang (2013) noticed some shortcoming in the I-influence. There are weighted games not being complete for the influence relation, something different to what occurs for simple games. They introduced several extensions of the desirability relation (see also Pongou, Tchantcho, & Diffo Lambo (2011)) by considering each condition in the definition of I-influence relation. A stronger form of I-completeness is H-completeness for which all the relations that intervene in the definition of completeness coincide. In this paper we also address the problem of achievable H-hierarchies. We show in particular that no strict hierarchy is achievable for games with 2 or 3 players. For games with 4 players, except the strict hierarchy for which we do not get any answer, all other hierarchies are achievable. For games with more than 5 players, the strict hierarchy is achievable in the class of H-complete(3,2)games. Furthermore, unlike the subclass of hierarchies(m,1,1)withm⩾2, all other H-hierarchies are achievable.Determining importance rankings is a significant issue in operational research. The study of ordinal preferences involves a variety of fields, including tournament theory, multiple criteria decision modeling (MCDM), and data envelopment analysis of qualitative data. As stated in the survey by Cook (2006), the notion of voter power or relative importance has been largely ignored in studies on ordinal ranking problems, although if a tangible estimate of voter importance exists, then these voters can be treated like criteria in an MCDM problem. The approach in our paper is useful in ranking voters in voting institutions where abstention is allowed as a third input. Examples of application of our results naturally apply to political institutions, but also in management enterprisers and even in reliability systems where voters are replaced by device components with three input levels. Examples in these different contexts can be found in: Levitin (2003), Obata and Ishii (2003), Alonso-Meijide, Bilbao, Casas-Méndez, and Fernández (2009), Sueyoshi, Shang, and Chiang (2009) or Freixas, Marciniak, and Pons (2012). The paper is organized as follows.The technical background as well as some useful results are recalled in Section 2. In Section 3, we recall several notion of desirability for(3,2)games and consider as well their completeness, their link with weightedness. In Section 4 we prove that all hierarchies induced by the influence relation are achievable in the particular class of weighted(3,2)games, the class of zero-centered strongly weighted VGA. As for H-hierarchies a partial study is done in section 5 and a conclusion then ends the paper.An ordered 3-partition of N (set of voters or players) is a sequenceS=S1,S2,S3of mutually disjoint subsets of N whose union is N. InS,S1stands for the set of yes voters,S2for abstainers andS3stands for no voters. We denote by3Nthe set of all ordered 3-partitions of N. ForS,S′∈3N, we writeS⊂3S′if S can be transformed intoS′by shifting one or more voters to higher levels of approval.Definition 2.1A(3,2)gameG=(N,V)consists of a finite set N of voters together with a value functionV:3N⟶0,1such that for all ordered 3-partitionS,S′, ifS⊂3S′thenV(S)=1impliesV(S′)=1.A 3-partition S such thatV(S)=1is said to be winning. A(3,2)game can be defined by its set of winning 3-partitions,W={S∈3N:V(S)=1}. In that case we denote the game by(N,W). In voting, it is often demanded that V be exhaustive, then from the monotonicity demanded toV,V(N)=0andV(M)=1whereNandMare respectively the 3-partitions withN3=NandM1=N. A special type of(3,2)simple games is the class of anonymous or symmetric games which have been intensively studied in Freixas and Zwicker (2009). Anonymous(3,2)games are games for which for all 3-partitionS,Sis winning if and only if for all permutationsπ:N→N,π(S)=(π(S1),π(S2),π(S3))is winning.Definition 2.2In a(3,2)game, a 3-partition S is said minimal winning if S is winning and for allT∈3Nsuch thatT⊂3S,Tis losing. As well, S is said maximal losing if S is losing and for allT∈3Nsuch thatS⊂3T,Tis winning.Either the set of minimal winning 3-partitions or the set of maximal losing 3-partitions completely generates the game. Next, we introduce weighted(3,2)games, which is a special type of weighted(j,k)games introduced in Freixas and Zwicker (2003).Definition 2.3LetG=(N,V)be a3,2game. A representation of G as a3,2weighted game consists of a sequencew=w1,w2,w3of 3 weight functions, wherewi:N⟶Rfor each i withw1p⩾w2p⩾w3pfor eachp∈N, together with a real number Q so called quota such that for any 3-partitionS,Sis winning if and only ifwS=∑i=13∑p∈Siwip⩾Q.According to this definition we can normalize, i.e. assign a zero weight, to any level of approval. Here we are mainly concerned with games with abstention for which we can normalize the weights at any of the three input levels, but we choose the “abstention” level which seems to be quite natural. If a null weight is assigned to abstainers, then a non-negative weight is assigned to “yes” voters and a non-positive weight to “no” voters. Thus, a weight2We are identifyingw+withw1,0withw2andw-withw3in Definition 2.3.2w(p)=(w+(p),0,w-(p))withw+(p)⩾0andw-(p)⩽0is assigned to eachp∈N. The only requirement for the threshold Q, if the(3,2)game is demanded to be exhaustive, isw(N)=w(∅,∅,N)=∑p∈Nw-(p)<Q⩽∑p∈Nw+(p)=w(N,∅,∅)=w(M).The previous definition can now be rewritten as follows.Definition 2.4A(3,2)game(N,W)is a weighted(3,2)game if there exists a sequence of weight functions(w+,0,w-)withw-(p)⩽0⩽w+(p)for allp∈N, and a quota Q such that for allS=(S1,S2,S3)∈3N,S∈W⇔w(S)=∑p∈S1w+(p)+∑p∈S3w-(p)⩾Q.Two consecutive stronger conditions of a weighted(3,2)game are the two following which were introduced in Freixas and Zwicker (2003):Definition 2.5A strongly weighted(3,2)game is a weighted(3,2)game that admits a representation such that for every pair of voters p and r,[w+(p)⩾w+(r),-w-(p)⩾-w-(r)]or[w+(p)⩽w+(r),-w-(p)⩽-w-(r)].A zero-centered strongly weighted(3,2)game is a strongly weighted(3,2)game that admits a representation with weightsw+(p)=-w-(p)for eachp∈N.We recall here the influence relation defined in Tchantcho et al. (2008).Definition 3.1LetG=(N,V)be a3,2game,p,r∈N:pis said to be at least as influential as r, denotedp≿Ir, if for allS1,S2,S3∈3Nit yields:•V(S1∪{p},S2⧹{p},S3)⩾V(S1∪{r},S2⧹{r},S3)ifp,r∈S2,V(S1,S2∪{p},S3⧹{p})⩾V(S1,S2∪{r},S3⧹{r})ifp,r∈S3, andV(S1∪{p},S2,S3⧹{p})⩾V(S1∪{r},S2,S3⧹{r})ifp,r∈S3.G is I-complete ifeitherp≿Irorr≿Ipfor all pairp,r∈N.The I-influence relation which is clearly a generalization of the desirability relation for simple games to(3,2)games, is reflexive, but is neither complete nor transitive in general. However, there exist weighted(3,2)games that are not complete under the I-influence relation. Although I-completeness is not consistent for the notion of weighted(3,2)games, it was shown in Freixas et al. (2013) that it is for the notion of strongly weighted(3,2)games. The I-influence is indeed too demanding. In Freixas et al. (2013), the three separate condition of the I-influence has been studied thus introducing a new class of complete games.Definition 3.2Let(N,V)be a(3,2)game. Letp,r∈N:(i)D+-desirability.p≿D+rif and only if for all 3-partitionS=(S1,S2,S3)such that both p and r belong toS2,V(S1∪{p},S2⧹{p},S3)⩾V(S1∪{r},S2⧹{r},S3).D--desirability.p≿D-rif and only if for all 3-partitionS=(S1,S2,S3)such that both p and r belong toS3,V(S1,S2∪{p},S3⧹{p})⩾V(S1,S2∪{r},S3⧹{r}).D±-desirability.p≿D±rif and only if for all 3-partitionS=(S1,S2,S3)such that both p and r belong toS3,V(S1∪{p},S2,S3⧹{p})⩾V(S1∪{r},S2,S3⧹{r}).Of course,V(S1∪{p},S2⧹{p},S3)⩾V(S1∪{r},S2⧹{r},S3)is equivalent to assert that(S1∪{r},S2⧹{r},S3)∈Wimplies that(S1∪{p},S2⧹{p},S3)∈W. And analogously for the two next inequalities in Definition 3.2.In general, none of the three separate relations,≿D+,≿D-and≿D±are transitive. The notion of completeness induced for the three separate relations considered in Definition 3.2 and two additional ones are recalled below.Definition 3.3LetG=(N,V)a (3,2) game.(i)G isD+-complete if eitherp≿D+rorr≿D+pfor allp,r∈N.G isD--complete if eitherp≿D-rorr≿D-pfor allp,r∈N.G isD±-complete if eitherp≿D±rorr≿D±pfor allp,r∈N.G is complete if it isD+-complete,D--complete andD±-complete.G is hierarchically complete or H-complete, denoted by≿H,if it is complete and the total rankings induced by≿D+,≿D-and≿D±coincide.Note that even if a(3,2)game is complete the total rankings given by≿D+,≿D-and≿D±can be different. The inclusion relations among the different classes of(3,2)games considered above can be summarized as follows.H-complete⊂I-complete⊂Complete∪∪Zero-centered strongly weighted⊂Strongly weighted⊂WeightedAnonymous(3,2)games are the simplest subclass of(3,2)games being H-complete and therefore I-complete and complete. These(3,2)games are the only ones with a unique equivalence class and therefore all players are hierarchically equivalents. Somewhat curious, and contrarily to what happens for simple games, is that some(3,2)anonymous games are not necessarily weighted, see Freixas and Zwicker (2009) and Zwicker (2009) for a characterization of anonymous weighted(3,2)games. However, if an anonymous(3,2)game is weighted it is zero-centered strongly weighted.Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the study of achievable hierarchies for I-complete and H-complete games respectively.This section is devoted to the study of the existence of achievable hierarchies for I-complete(3,2)games. The study of hierarchies within the class of simple games can be traced back to Friedman et al. (2006) and continued by Bean, Friedman, and Parker (2008), even though it is also an implicit study in Carreras and Freixas (1996). Indeed, in Friedman et al. (2006) it is proved that complete simple games and, particularly, weighted simple games show many different hierarchies, although two sequences of hierarchies are never achievable. Freixas and Pons (2010) proved that all hierarchies are achievable in the class of weakly complete games as long as the number of voters is greater than 5. For less than 6 voters, only four hierarchies are not achieved in this class of games, and they are:(1,1,1),(1,1,1,1),(2,1,1)and(2,1,1,1). But none of these four hierarchies is achieved either in any other kind of simple games. As a consequence of these results we can state that, given any complete pre-ordering defined on a finite set of voters (with more than five elements), it is possible to construct a simple game such that the pre-orderings induced by Shapley and Shubik (1954), and Banzhaf (1965) and Coleman (1971) power indices coincide with the given pre-ordering.Definition 4.1LetG=(N,W)be a(3,2)game and≿be a pre-ordering on N. We say that the sequence(m1,…,mt)with∑i=1tmi=nis achievable for≿if there are t equivalence classesA1,…,Atfor≿which form a partition of N withm1,…,mtvoters respectively andp≻rwheneverp∈Ai,r∈Ajwithi<j.Note that at most there are2n-1different hierarchies for games with nvoters. Parker (2012) proves that all hierarchies for ternary voting games are achievable in the class of I-complete games. The purpose of this section is to prove that all hierarchies are achievable in the subclass of zero-centered strongly weighted games. For that, we will need the following result that was proved in Freixas et al. (2013), that establishes some links between weights and desirability relations for(3,2)games.Proposition 4.2Given two arbitrary players p and r in a weighted(3,2)game, for any weight function representing it, we have:(i)w+(p)⩾w+(r)⇒p≿D+r.-w-(p)⩾-w-(r)⇒p≿D-r.w+(p)-w-(p)⩾w+(r)-w-(r)⇒p≿D±r.All I-hierarchies are achievable in the class of zero-centered strongly weighted(3,2)games.Following Friedman et al. (2006)’s result for simple games, all D-hierarchies are achievable for weighted simple games except the two sequences:(m,1,1,1)and(m,1,1)form⩾1. Hence, there exist suitable weighted(2,2)games certifying all achievable hierarchies for≿D. We assume in what follows that the weighted representations chosen for these weighted games assign the same weights to equally-desirable voters for the≿Drelation, i.e. ifi≿Djandj≿Di(ori≈Dj) if and only ifwi=wj.Let(m1,…,mt)be a given hierarchy with∑k=1tmk=nand different of(m,1,1,1)and(m,1,1)for allm⩾1. Then it exists a weighted simple game with weighted representation[Q;w1,w2,…,wn]such thatwi>wjif and only ifi≻Djandwi=wjif and only ifi≈Dj, and with(m1,…,mt)as a hierarchy.From each of these weighted representations we define a zero-sum strongly weighted(3,2)voting game as follows: the quota is Q and the weights for voters arew(i)=(wi,0,-wi)for alli∈N.Ifi≻Dj(equivalently towi>wjaccording to the selection of weights done) we haveV(S1∪{i},S2⧹{i},S3)⩾V(S1∪{j},S2⧹{j},S3)for all 3-partition withi,j∈S2sincew+(i)=wi>wj=w+(j)which impliesw(S1∪{i},S2⧹{i},S3)=(wi-wj)+w(S1∪{j},S2⧹{j},S3)>w(S1∪{j},S2⧹{j},S3). Note, moreover, that each minimal winning bipartition for the simple game(S,N⧹S)induces the minimal winning 3-partition(S,N⧹S,∅)for the(3,2)game, and asi≻Djit exists at least a bipartition(S,N⧹S)withi,j∉Ssuch thatw(S∪{i},(N⧹S)⧹{i})⩾Qandw(S∪{j},(N⧹S)⧹{j})<Q. Thus, the induced 3-partition(S,N⧹S,∅)withi,j∉Sverifiesw(S∪{i},(N⧹S)⧹{i})⩾Qandw(S∪{j},(N⧹S)⧹{j})<Q. Hence,i≻Djfor the simple game if and only ifi≻D+jfor the(3,2)game.Furthermore, as the(3,2)game is zero-centered strongly weighted, we havei≿D±jandi≿D-jwheneveri≻Dj(or, equivalently,i≻D+j), sincewi-(-wi)>wj-(-wj)and0-(-wi)>0-(-wj)respectively.Ifi≈Dj(equivalently towi=wjaccording to the selection of weights done) we havei≈Djfor the simple game if and only ifi≈D+j,i≈D-jandi≈D±jif and only ifi≈Ijfor the(3,2)game. In other words, relation≿Dfor the simple game coincides with the influence relation≿Ifor the(3,2)game.Now it remains to prove that the two sequences(m,1,1,1)and(m,1,1)form⩾1are also achievable in the class of zero-centered strongly weighted(3,2)games.•Proof for(m,1,1,1).Consider the zero-centered strongly game with n voters with quotaQ=1and weights:w(a)=(1,0,-1),w(b)=(2,0,-2),w(c)=(3,0,-3),w(di)=(4,0,-4)wherei=1,…,n-3. By Proposition 4.2 it follows:di≿Ic≿Ib≿Ia.It only remains to prove that these rankings are strict. However, one may easily check, by choosing convenient 3-partitions thatdi≈D+c,c≈D+b,b≈D-aHence,di≻Ic≻Ib≻Iaand the I-hierarchy(m,1,1,1)is achievable for this zero-centered strongly weighted(3,2)game.Proof for(m,1,1).Consider the zero-centered strongly game with n voters with quotaQ=2and weights:w(a)=(1,0,-1),w(b)=(2,0,-2),w(ci)=(3,0,-3)wherei=1,…,n-2. By Proposition 4.2 it follows:ci≿Ib≿Ia.It only remains to prove that these rankings are strict. One may easily check, by choosing convenient 3-partitions thatci≈D+b,b≈D+aHence,ci≻Ib≻Iaand the I-hierarchy(m,1,1)is achievable for this zero-centered strongly weighted(3,2)game.□In this section, we partially address the problem of existence of achievable hierarchies for H-complete(3,2)games.The following notations are useful.Notation 5.1Given a subset A of N, a voterb∈A, a 3-partitionS=S1,S2,S3ofN,p,r∈Nandx∉N, we denote by:•πprthe transposition of voters p and r of N.T=S⧹{r}the 3-partition ofN⧹{r}such that:∀i∈{1,2,3},Ti=Siifr∉SiSi⧹{r}ifr∈SiTxS,Athe 3-partition T ofN∪{x}such that:x∈Ttwheret=mini∈{1,2,3}{i:A∩Si≠∅},and the level of approval of every player ofNinTis the same as inS.Txb,S,Athe 3-partition T ofN∪{x}such that:x∈Tiifb∈Siandb∈Tkwherek=mini∈{1,2,3}{i,(A⧹{b})∩Si≠∅},and the level of approval of every player ofN⧹{b}inTis the same as inS.The 2-player case: It is obvious that when there are only two voters, the hierarchy≈is achievable meanwhile the strict hierarchy≻is not.The 3-player case: This case is solved in the following result.Forn=3, the H-hierarchies(3)and(2,1)are achievable meanwhile H-hierarchies(1,1,1)and(1,2)are not achievable.First, it is obvious that the following H-complete (3,2) games achieve the H-hierarchies(3)and(2,1)respectively. LetN={a,b,c}:for the hierarchy(3), takeWm={(abc,∅,∅)}and for(2,1), consider the setWm={(a,b,c),(b,a,c)}.Now, assume that there is a 3-player3,2game withN=a,b,csuch thata≻Hb≻Hc. Then there exist three 3-partitionsA,B,Cof N such that:a∈A1∩B1,b∈A2∩C1,c∈B2∩C2,A,B,C∈Wandπab(A),πac(B),πbc(C)∉W.First case:c∈A3First, let us assume thatb∈B3. Ifa∈C3, thenA=(a,b,c),B=(a,c,b)andC=(b,c,a)which impliesπab(A)=πac(C).πac(C)∈WsinceC∈Wanda≻Hcmeanwhileπab(A)∉W; it is a contradiction. Ifa∈C2, thenA=(a,b,c),B=(a,c,b)andC=(b,ac,∅). We will show in this condition thatb≈D-c. It suffices to show thatc≿D-b. Let S be a 3-partition such thatb,c∈S3and assume that(S1,S2∪{b},S3⧹{b})∈W. Since none of the 3-partitions(∅,ab,c)and(∅,b,ac)is winning, we must have(S1,S2∪{b},S3⧹{b})=(a,b,c)and therefore(S1,S2∪{c},S3⧹{c})=(a,c,b)=B∈W. Thus,c≿D-band by hypothesis,b≻Hcimplying thatb≿D-c. Finally,b≈D-cwhich is a contradiction. Ifa∈C1, it can easily be shown thatb≈D-c, which is once again a contradiction.Second, let us assume thatb∈B2. Ifa∈C3, thenπab(A)=πac(C)∈WsinceC∈Wanda≻Hc. However,πab(A)∉Wand this is a contradiction. Ifa∈C2, then we havea≈D-c, which is a contradiction. Ifa∈C1, then we havea≈D-c, which is also a contradiction.Finally, let us assume thatb∈B1. Ifa∈C3, thenπab(A)=πac(C)∈WsinceC∈Wanda≻Hc. However,πab(A)∉Wand this is a contradiction. Ifa∈C2, then the contradiction follows and ifa∈C1, thenπbc(C)⊃A∈W. It is a contradiction.Second case:c∈A2∪A1.Ifa∈C3∪C2, then it can be checked thatπab(A)⊇C∈W, which is a contradiction becauseπab(A)∉W.Ifa∈C1, thenπbc(C)⊇A∈W, a contradiction becauseπbc(C)∉W.Hence, forn=3the H-strict hierarchy is not achievable.We can prove analogously that the H-hierarchy(1,2)is not achievable.□We give in Table 1some examples of strongly weighted3,2games and the H-hierarchies induced by these games, whereWmdenotes the set of minimal winning tripartitions.In the sequel we consider the casesn⩾4. We need the following important lemma.Lemma 5.3If an H-hierarchy(m1,…,mi,…,mt)is achievable then the H-hierarchy(m1,…,mi+1,…,mt)is achievable as well.LetN,Wbe a3,2game that achieves the H-hierarchy (m1,…,mi,…,mt). LetAithe set of themiequivalent players in the preceding H-hierarchy and letN′=N∪{x}.W′={T∈3N′:∃b,S∈Ai×W,T=TxS,AiorT=Txb,S,Ai}.We will show that(N′,W′)achieves the H-hierarchy(m1,…,mi+1,…,mt).LetBi=Ai∪{x}andBj=Ajfor allj∈1,…,i-1,i+1,…,t.Let us considerp∈Bk,r∈Bj,k⩽j.It is obvious that ifk=jthen p and r are equivalent. In the sequel we assume with no loss of generality thatk<j.First case:j≠iandk≠i.There exists a 3-partitionS∈Wsuch thatp∈S1,r∈S2andπpr(S)∉W, sincep≻D+rinN,W.We haveT=Tx(S,Ai)∈W′. Ifπpr(T)∈W′, thenπpr(T⧹{x})∈W, which is a contradiction sinceπpr(T⧹{x})=πpr(S). Thus,πpr(T)∉W′and hence,p≻D+rinN′,W′. Similarly, we havep≻D-randp≻D±rinN′,W′.Second case:j=iandk≠i.First, assume thatr≠x. There exists a 3-partitionS∈Wsuch that:p∈S1,r∈S2andπpr(S)∉W, sincep≻D+rin(N,W).T=Tx(S;Ai)∈W′. If∃a∈Bi⧹{x},a∈S1, thenπpr(T)∈W′implies thatπpr(T⧹{x})∈W, which is a contradiction sinceπpr(T⧹{x})=πpr(S). Thus,πpr(T)∉W′. IfBi∩S1=∅, thenBi∩πpr(T1)=randπpr(T)∉W′, (see the definition ofW′). Hence,p≻D+rinN′,W′. Similarly, we havep≻D-randp≻D±rinN′,W′.Second, assume thatr=x. Letb∈Bi:b≠x. There exists a 3-partitionS∈Wsuch thatp∈S1,b∈S2andπpb(S)∉W, sincep≻D+binN,W. Then,T=Tx(b,S,Ai)∈W′. If∃a∈Bi⧹{x},a∈S1, thenπpx(T)∈W′impliesπpx(T⧹{x})∈W(by the definition ofW′). This is a contradiction sinceπpx(T⧹{x})=πpb(S), thusπpx(T)∉W′.IfBi∩S1=∅, then,Bi∩πpx(T1)=xandπpx(T)∉W′(by the definition ofW′). Hence,p≻D+xin(N′,W′).Likewise,p≻D-xandp≻D±xin(N′,W′).Third case: Ifj≠iandk=i.First, assume thatp≠x. There exists a 3-partitionS∈Wsuch thatp∈S1,r∈S2andπpr(S)∉Wsincep≻D+rinN,W. We haveT=Tx(S,Ai)∈W′. If∃a∈Bi⧹x,p,a∈S1, thenπpr(T)∈W′implying thatπpr(T⧹{x})∈W. This is a contradiction sinceπpr(T⧹{x})=πpr(S): thusπpr(T)∉W′. IfBi∩S1=p, Thenπpr(T)∉W′(see the definition ofW′) hence,p≻D+rin(N′,W′). Likewise,p≻D-randp≻D±rin(N′,W′).Now assume thatp=x. Letb∈Bi,b≠x. There exists a 3-partitionS∈Wsuch that:b∈S1;r∈S2andπbr(S)∉W, sinceb≻D+rinN,W. We haveT=Tx(S,Ai)∈W′. If∃a∈Bi⧹x,b,a∈S1, thenπxr(T)∈W′impliesS′∈W, whereS′is the 3-partition of N such that:b∈S2′,r∈S1′and every player ofN⧹b,rhas the same level of approval inS′andπxr(T). This is a contradiction sinceS′=πbr(S); thusπxr(T)∉W′.IfBi∩S1=b, thenπxr(T)∉W′(see definition ofW′). Hence,x≻D+rin(N′,W′).Similarly, we havex≻D-randx≻D±rin(N′,W′).□Forn=4, any H-hierarchy distinct from(1,1,1,1)and(2,1,1)is achievable.The H-hierarchies(4),(3,1), and(2,2)are achievable thanks to the lemma5.3above and the fact that(3)and(2,1)are achievable H-hierarchies. It can be seen from Table 1 above that the H-hierarchies(1,3),(1,2,1)and(1,1,2)are achievable.□Forn⩾5, the strict H-hierarchy(1,1,…,1)is achievable.Assume thatn⩾5and consider the following3,2gameN,WwhereN=x1,x2,…,xn-1,xnand the set of minimal winning 3-partitions is given by:Wm={xa},N⧹{xa,xb},{xb},a,b∈1,…,na<b,b∉{a+2;a+3:a⩽n-3};{xi},N⧹{xi,xi+2,xi+3},{xi+2,xi+3},i=1,…,n-3;{xn-2,xn-4},N⧹{xn-4,xn-3,xn-2,xn},{xn,xn-3};{xn-1},N⧹{xn-1},∅;{x3,x4,x5},N⧹{x2,x3,x4,x5},{x2}.It is obvious that the game above achieves the strict H-hierarchy(x1≻x2≻⋯≻xn-1≻xn).□For allt∈N,t⩾5, the H-hierarchy(m1,m2,…,mt)withmi⩾1,1⩽i⩽tis achievable.Considering the preceding Proposition and Lemma 5.3, the proof of this theorem is straightforward.□The H-hierarchies(1,1),(1,2)and(1,1,1)are not achievable.Nothing have been said for H-hierarchies(1,1,1,1)and(m,1,1)for anym⩾2.All other H-hierarchies are achievable.
