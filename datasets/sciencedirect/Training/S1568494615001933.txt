@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm inspired by the ions motion in nature. In fact, the proposed algorithm mimics the attraction and repulsion of anions and cations to perform optimization. The proposed algorithm is designed in such a way to have the least tuning parameters, low computational complexity, fast convergence, and high local optima avoidance. The performance of this algorithm is benchmarked on 10 standard test functions and compared to four well-known algorithms in the literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to show very competitive results and has merits in solving challenging optimization problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the last two decades, numerous algorithms with inspiration from the nature have been proposed for solving various optimization problems. Some of the most popular are Genetic Algorithm (GA) [1–5], Differential Evolution Algorithm (DE) [6–10], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [11–14], and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) [15–19]. Optimization algorithms have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other and may show different performances when solving discrete and continuous problems.There are two conflicting criteria when assessing two algorithms: convergence rate versus quality of the final solution. Fast convergence speed may result in premature convergence and entrapment in local optima. On the other hand, favoring quality of solutions may results in more extensive search of the search space and consequently slower convergence. To address these two issues, the researchers improve the current algorithms or propose new techniques. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm called Ions Motion Optimization (IMO) is proposed as a competitive algorithm in this field.The IMO algorithm is a population-based algorithm inspired from properties of ions in nature. Our main objectives when designing this algorithm are to require IMO to have the least number of tuning parameters, low computational complexity, fast convergence, and high local optima avoidance. The main inspirations of the IMO algorithm are two different ions: anion (a negative charged particle) and cation (a positive charged particle). The IMO algorithm divides the population of candidate solutions to two sets of negative charged ions and positive charged ions, and improve them according to the important characteristics of the ions “ions with the same charges repel each other, but with opposite charges attract each other” [20].In liquid state, the ions have greater freedom of motion compared to the solid phase (crystal) where high attraction forces between prevent ions from moving around freely. In fact, ions face minor motion and mostly vibrate in their position in solid phase. The IMO algorithm also mimics these two phases to perform diversification and intensification during optimization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2 provides the literature review of the recent meta-heuristics algorithms. Section 3 proposes the IMO algorithm. The results and discussion of the test functions are provided in Section 4. Eventually, Section 5 concludes the works and opens some avenues for future studies.
