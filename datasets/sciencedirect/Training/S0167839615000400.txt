Toric surface patches are a multi-sided generalization of classical rational Bézier surface patches which are widely used in free-form surface modeling. In this paper, we present the first derivatives of toric surface patches along the boundary and study theG1continuity between adjacent toric surface patches by the toric degenerations. Furthermore, some practicalG1sufficient conditions of toric surface patches are developed and the representative examples are given.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The triangular and rectangular Bézier surface patches are effectively applied in many areas of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) and Computer Aided Design (CAD) since they were developed in the late 1950s (Boehm et al., 1987). The multi-sided surface patches are often required to fill n-sided holes and design freeform surfaces in manufacturing industry. Warren (1992) created the multi-sided Bézier surface patches using bases points and predicted that the further work incorporating techniques from toric variety may lead to practical methods for multi-sided patches. In 2002, Krasauskas (2002) presented a kind of multi-sided surface patches, named toric surface patches, from the theory of toric varieties in Algebraic Geometry and toric ideals in Combinatorics. The toric surface patches are a multi-sided generalization of classical Bézier surface patches. Moreover, many real rational surfaces which are actively used in CAGD are found to be toric surface patches (Krasauskas, 2001).Toric surface patches have attracted many scholars' attentions from their appearance. Craciun et al. (2010) applied toric geometry to explain how the geometric properties of toric surface patches are related with the control points. Krasauskas and Goldman (2003), Goldman (2002) developed several algorithms for toric surface patches with depth, including de Casteljau pyramid evaluation algorithm, blossoming and so on. García-Puente et al. (2011) presented the toric degenerations of toric surface patches and explained regular control surface which is the limiting position of a rational Bézier surface patch when the weights are allowed to vary. Zhu and Zhao (2014) presented a geometric condition on the control polygon which implies the injectivity of rational Bézier curves.Geometric continuity between adjacent surface patches, especially for the Bézier surface patches, are actively researched in geometric modeling. Many literatures have been devoted to this area (cf. Boehm, 1988; Kahmann, 1983; Farin, 1982; Degen, 1990; Veltkamp, 1992; Hermann and Lukács, 1996). DeRose (1990) gave the necessary and sufficient conditions for tangent plane continuity between two rational polynomial surfaces. Liu (1990) presented theG1necessary and sufficient conditions between adjacent triangular or rectangular Bézier surface patches and developed some practical sufficient conditions. Zheng et al. (1992) derived the constructive conditions of curvature continuity between adjacent rational Bézier surface patches and developed a series of simple sufficient conditions. Kiciak (1995) analyzed the problem of constructing a surface patch possessingG1continuity to another one and presented a method which can be used in an interactive geometric editor. Ye et al. (1996) presented the necessary and sufficient conditions of two adjacent Bézier surface patches of arbitrary degrees joiningGn-continuously along a common boundary curve and developed an algorithm to compute the order of continuity between two given Bézier surface patches. Che et al. (2005) discussed theG1continuity of NURBS surface patches with arbitrary degrees and generally structured knots, and obtained the uniform continuity conditions.In this paper, we apply the theory of toric degenerations to the geometric continuity of toric surface patches and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions ofG1continuity between adjacent toric surface patches. We prove the tangent planes are invariant under the toric degenerations indexed by the special regular decomposition, that is, the family of tangent planes of toric surface patches are the same with the family of tangent planes of their regular control surfaces along the boundary. Then theG1continuity problem of toric surface patches can be converted to theG1continuity problem of the regular control surfaces. Moreover, some practical sufficient conditions ofG1continuity for toric surface patches are developed.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the related results about the toric surface patches and the theory of toric degenerations. In Section 3, we derive the properties of the first derivatives of toric surface patches along the boundary and present the necessary and sufficient conditions ofG1continuity of adjacent toric surface patches. In Section 4, some practical sufficient conditions ofG1continuity are presented.LetA={a1,a2,⋯,am}∈Z2be a set of finite integers, the lattice polygonIAbe the convex hull ofAwith the verticesv1,…,vnand the kth edgeΓkofIAbe defined by lineLk(u,v)=aku+bkv+ck,k=1,…,n. Suppose edgesΓk,k=1,2,⋯,n, are ordered counter-clockwise andvkis the intersected vertex where two edgesΓk−1andΓkmeet. Normalize these line equations so that the every normal vector(ak,bk)satisfies the following two additional conditions:1).the normal vector(ak,bk)is inward oriented;(ak,bk)is a primitive lattice vector, that is, it is the shortest vector in this direction with integer coordinates.Definition 1(See Krasauskas (2002).) A toric surface patch defined onIAis a piece of a surface parameterized by the mapB:IA→R3(1)BA,ω,P(u,v)=∑ai∈Aβai(u,v)ωaipai∑ai∈Aβai(u,v)ωai,(u,v)∈IA,where{βai(u,v)}ai∈Aare the toric Bernstein basis functions, andω={ωai≥0|ai∈A}andP={pai|ai∈A}are the corresponding weights and control points. Denote the image ofBA,ω,P(u,v)onIAbyBA,ω,P, that isBA,ω,P(IA).Remark 1IfIAis a triangle or rectangle, the toric Bernstein basis functions{βai(u,v)}ai∈Aare exactly the classical triangular or tensor-product Bernstein basis functions by taking proper values forcaiand parametric transformation, then the toric surface patch is the classical triangular or tensor-product Bézier surface patch (Krasauskas, 2002).The lattice polygonIAcharacterizes the geometry of the toric surface patches and the lattice setAdescribes the topology structure of the control nets. For the toric surface patches, the geometry of the surface patches and the combinatorial structure of the control nets are closely related. It turns out that the toric surface patches have many good geometric properties analogous to the classical Bézier surface patches, such as affine invariant, the convex hull property, the boundary property and interpolating the corner control points (Krasauskas and Goldman, 2003).For each vertexvkofIA, a lattice corner triangle△kconsisted ofvkand the two nearest lattice points on the adjacent boundary edges is called a corner triangle ofvk.Krasauskas (2002) claimed that a corner point of toric surface patch corresponding to a vertexvkofIAis non-singular if and only if the area of its corner triangle equals 1/2. In this paper, we assume the toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)defined onIAis non-singular, that is, area of every corner triangle ofIAequals 1/2.The control polygon of a Bézier curve has intuitively geometric significance-there is a sequence of weights under which the limiting position of the curve is the control polygon. For a toric surface patch, García-Puente et al. (2011) defined a regular control surface governed by the regular decomposition ofA, and proved the regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limiting positions of a Bézier surface patch when the weights are allowed to vary. We introduce their work in this section.LetA∈Z2be a finite set andλ:A→Rbe a lifting function. We use λ to lift the points ofAintoR3. LetPλbe the convex hull of the lifted points,Pλ=conv{(ai,λ(ai))|ai∈A}⊂R3.Each face ofPλhas an outward pointing normal vector, and its upper faces are those whose normal has positive last coordinate. If we project these upper faces back toR2, they coverIAand are the faces of the decompositionTλofIAindexed by λ. A polygonal decomposition ofIAis a collectionTλof polygons, line segments, and points ofIAand any two elements ofTλare neither disjoint or their intersection is an element ofTλ. A decompositionTλis regular if it is induced from a lifting function. A decompositionSλofAis a collection of subsets ofAcalled faces. The convex hulls of these subsets are required to be the polygons of a decompositionT(Sλ)ofIA. The decompositionSλis regular if the decompositionT(Sλ)is regular (García-Puente et al., 2011).Example 1As Fig. 1shows, on the left are the weights of a bi-cubic patch, in the center are the values of a lifting function, and the corresponding regular decomposition is on the right.Suppose that we have a decompositionSλofAindexed by the lifting function λ, we may use the weightsω={ωai|ai∈F}and control pointsP={pai|ai∈F}indexed by elements of a subsetFofSλas weights and control points for a toric surface patch, denoted byBF,ω|F,P|F. The union of these patchesBA,ω,P(Sλ):=⋃F∈SλBF,ω|F,P|Fis called the regular control surface indexed by the decompositionSλ. As the domain of a patch of shapeFis the convex hullIFofF,BF,ω|F,P|Fis a toric surface patch too (Craciun et al., 2010).Letλ:A→Rbe a lifting function andSλbe the corresponding regular decomposition ofA. For the given weightsω={ωai|ai∈A}, we get a set of weights which depend upon λ,ωλ(t):={tλ(ai)ωai|ai∈A}. We can define a toric degeneration of the patch by these weights,BA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)=∑ai∈Atλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωaipai∑ai∈Atλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωai.The regular control surfaceBA,ω,P(Sλ)is the limit of the patchesBA,ωλ(t),Past→∞.Theorem 1(SeeGarcía-Puente et al. (2011).)limt→∞BA,ωλ(t),P=BA,ω,P(Sλ).Example 2Fig. 2shows the toric degenerations of a rational bi-cubic Bézier patch att=1,t=8, and the regular control surface (t→∞), which is the union of five toric surface patches indexed by regular decomposition illustrated in Fig. 1.In this section, we analyze the derivatives of toric surface patches along the boundary and prove tangent plane is invariant at every point along the boundary under the toric degenerations, then theG1continuity problem of toric surface patches can be converted to theG1continuity problem of the pieces of regular control surface patches.In order to discuss the derivatives of toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)defined in Eq. (1), we start by differentiating the toric Bernstein basis functions{βai(u,v)}ai∈Aalong the boundaryΓk:Lk(u,v)=aku+bkv+ck.As Fig. 3shows, letΓk⋆:Lk⋆(u,v)=aku+bkv+ck−1denote the line segment in the convex hullIA. Notice thatΓk⋆is parallel toΓk.By the product rule for differentiation, we have∂βai(u,v)∂u=cai∑k=1nL1L1(ai)(u,v)⋯∂LkLk(ai)(u,v)∂u⋯LnLn(ai)(u,v).In fact, most of the toric Bernstein basis functions and their partial derivatives vanish along the boundaryΓk. LetAΓkbe the indices ofAlying onΓkandAΓk⋆be the indices ofAlying onΓk⋆. By the definition of toric Bernstein basis functions, we have the following lemmas.Lemma 1(SeeGoldman (2002).)βai(u,v)|Γk=0,ai∉AΓk.Lemma 2∂βai(u,v)∂u|Γk=0,∂βai(u,v)∂v|Γk=0,ai∉Ak,whereAk={AΓk,AΓk⋆}.Notice that∂Lk(u,v)∂u=ak,∂Lk(u,v)∂v=bk, then∂βai(u,v)∂u=cai∑k=1nakLk(ai)L1(u,v)L1(ai)⋯Lk(u,v)Lk(ai)−1⋯Ln(u,v)Ln(ai),∂βai(u,v)∂v=cai∑k=1nbkLk(ai)L1(u,v)L1(ai)⋯Lk(u,v)Lk(ai)−1⋯Ln(u,v)Ln(ai).Ifai∉Ak, thenLk(ai)>1,Lk(u,v)Lk(a)−1|Γk=0, hence∂βai(u,v)∂u|Γk=0,∂βai(u,v)∂v|Γk=0.□From the above analysis, we have the following proposition.Proposition 1Only the control points and corresponding weights indexed byAkaffect the first order partial derivatives of toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)along the boundaryΓk.For the toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)defined onIA, a lifting functionλ:A→Rsatisfying the two additional conditions:1).λ(ai)equals each other whileai∈Ak;Akis a face ofSλ, i.e.,Ak∈Sλ, whereSλis the regular decomposition ofAindexed by λAs Fig. 3 shows, we use the weightsω={ωai|ai∈Ak}and control pointsP={pai|ai∈Ak}constructing a toric surface patch, denoted byBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak. ThenBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak∈BA,ω,P(Sλ),whereBA,ω,P(Sλ)is the regular control surfaces ofBA,ω,P(u,v)indexed by the decompositionSλofA.Now we prove the first partial derivatives of toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)are invariant along the boundaryΓkunder the toric degeneration indexed bySλofAwhile λ satisfies the lifting criterion onAk. Actually, we only need to prove the first partial derivatives ofBA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)are equal to the first partial derivatives ofBA,ωλ(t+Δt),P(u,v;t+Δt)onΓk.Theorem 2For the toric Bézier patchBA,ω,P(u,v), given a fitting function λ which satisfies the lifting criterion onAk, then along the boundaryΓk,∂BA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)∂u|Γk=∂BA,ωλ(t+Δt),P(u,v;t+Δt)∂u|Γk.We denoteBA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)=Num(u,v;t)Den(u,v;t),whereNum(u,v;t)=∑ai∈Atλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωaipaiandDen(u,v;t)=∑ai∈Atλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωai.We have(2)∂BA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)∂u=Num(u,v;t)uDen(u,v;t)−Num(u,v;t)Den(u,v;t)uDen(u,v;t)2,by Lemma 1,βai(u,v)|Γk=0,ai∉AΓk, thenNum(u,v;t)|Γk=∑ai∈AΓktλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωaipai,Den(u,v;t)|Γk=∑ai∈AΓktλ(ai)βai(u,v)ωai.Since theλ(ai)equals each other forai∈Ak, supposeλ(a)=λ(ai),ai∈Ak, we haveNum(u,v;t)|Γk=tλ(a)∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωaipai,Den(u,v;t)|Γk=tλ(a)∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωai.Similarly, by Lemma 2,∂βai(u,v)∂u|Γk=0,ai∉Ak, thenNum(u,v;t)u|Γk=∑ai∈Aktλ(ai)∂βai(u,v)∂uωaipai=tλ(a)∑ai∈Ak∂βai(u,v)∂uωaipai,Den(u,v;t)u|Γk=∑ai∈Aktλ(ai)∂βai(u,v)∂uωai=tλ(a)∑ai∈Ak∂βai(u,v)∂uωai.Substituting the above equations into (2), we have∂BA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)∂u=∑ai∈Ak∂βai(u,v)∂uωaipai∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωai(∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωai)2−∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωaipai∑ai∈Ak∂βai(u,v)∂uωai(∑ai∈AΓkβai(u,v)ωai)2.Notice that numerator and denominator are independent with the variable t, then∂BA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)∂u|Γk=∂BA,ωλ(t+Δt),P(u,v;t+Δt)∂u|Γk.The result on the first order partial derivatives ofBA,ω,P(u,v)with respect to v can be proved in the same way.  □Theorem 3The toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)has the same tangent plane with toric surface patchBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak(u,v)at every point along the boundaryΓk.Actually, whilet=1,BA,ωλ(1),P=BA,ω,P, and whilet→∞,BAk,ω|Ak,P|Akis the limit ofBA,ωλ(t),PonIAk. By Theorem 2, the partial derivatives ofBA,ωλ(t),P(u,v;t)are invariant at every point alongΓk, the above theorem holds. Goldman (2002, pp. 519–520) proved that the first partial derivatives of toric surface patches of depth d are affected by the elements ofAΓkd−1⊕Aalong the boundaryΓk, which means that the tangent planes of toric surface patch along the boundaryΓkdepend on all the control points and weights indexed byA. Theorem 3 shows that tangent planes of toric surface patch along the boundaryΓkare only affected by the control points and weights indexed byAk.LetBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)be toric surface patches defined on adjacent convex hullIAandIA˜respectively, andΓkbe the common boundary ofIAandIA˜. Now we give the definitions of theG0continuity andG1continuity betweenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)along the common boundaryΓk.Definition 2If the toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)satisfyBA,ω,P(u,v)=B˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v),(u,v)∈Γk,then they are calledC0orG0continuity alongΓk.Definition 3If the toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)areG0continuous along the common boundaryΓk, and they have the common tangent plane at every point alongΓk, then they are calledG1continuity alongΓk.According to the boundary property of toric surface patches (Krasauskas, 2002), the boundary of toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)is a rational Bézier curve, defined by the control points{pai|ai∈Ak}and corresponding weights{ωai≥0|ai∈Ak}alongΓk. We have the following theorem about theG0continuity between toric surface patches.Theorem 4Toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)areG0continuous along the common boundaryΓkif and only if the control points and corresponding weights ofBA,ω,P(u,v)are the same with those ofB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)alongΓk.By Theorem 3, we have the following theorem about theG1continuity between toric surface patches.Theorem 5Let toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)beG0continuous jointly along the common boundaryΓk. ThenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)areG1continuity alongΓkif and only if toric surface patchesBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak(u,v)andB˜A˜k,ω˜|A˜k,P˜|A˜k(u,v)areG1continuity alongΓk.From the above analysis, we can convert theG1continuity problem of toric surface patches to theG1continuity problem of the pieces of regular control surfaces by the toric degenerations. In this section, we present some applicableG1sufficient conditions of non-singular toric surface patches along the common boundary by the known results about the geometric continuity of Bézier surface patches.There is a number of literatures focused on theG1continuity of Bézier surface patches (Boehm, 1988; Farin, 1982; Liu, 1990). Now we recall some practicalG1sufficient conditions of rational Bézier surface patches.Theorem 6(SeeLiu (1990).) AsFig. 4(a) shows, aG1sufficient condition between adjacentG0continuous rectangular rational Bézier surface patches along the common boundary of degree n is that1.whilei=0,(ω1,0p1,0,ω1,0),(ω0,0p0,0,ω0,0),(ω0,1p0,1,ω0,1)and(ω1,0⋆p1,0⋆,ω1,0⋆)are coplanar, namely,(3)(ω1,0⋆p1,0⋆,ω1,0⋆)=a(ω1,0p1,0,ω1,0)+b(ω0,0p0,0,ω0,0)+c(ω0,1p0,1,ω0,1),wherea,band c are arbitrary constants.whilei=n,(ω1,np1,n,ω1,n),(ω0,np0,n,ω0,n),(ω0,n−1p0,n−1,ω0,n−1)and(ω1,n⋆p1,n⋆,ω1,n⋆)are coplanar, namely,(4)(ω1,n⋆p1,n⋆,ω1,n⋆)=a(ω1,np1,n,ω1,n)+b(ω0,np0,n,ω0,n)+c(ω0,n−1p0,n−1,ω0,n−1),wherea,band c are arbitrary constants.whilei=1,⋯,n−1,(5)ω1,i⋆(p1,i⋆−p0,i)=aω1,i(p1,i−p0,i)+binω0,i−1(p0,i−p0,i−1)+c(1−in)ω0,i+1(p0,i+1−p0,i),ω1,i⋆−ω0,i=a(ω1,i−ω0,i)+bin(ω0,i−ω0,i−1)+c(1−in)(ω0,i+1−ω0,i)+dω0,i,where a, b, c and d are arbitrary constants.Theorem 7(SeeLiu (1990).) AsFig. 4(b) shows, aG1sufficient condition between adjacentG0continuous triangular rational Bézier surface patches along the common boundary of degree n is thataωi,1,n−1−i(pi,1,n−i−1−pi,0,n−i)+bωi+1,0,n−1−i(pi+1,0,n−i−1−pi,0,n−i)+cωi,1,n−1−i⋆(pi,1,n−1−i⋆−pi,0,n−i)=0,a(ωi,1,n−1−i−ωi,0,n−i)+b(ωi+1,0,n−1−i−ωi,0,n−i)+c(ωi,1,n−1−i⋆−ωi,0,n−i)=0,wherei=0,⋯,n−1anda,b,care arbitrary constants.Krasauskas (2002) claimed that a corner point corresponding to a vertexvkis non-singular if and only if the area of the corner triangle equals 1/2. If the toric surface patch is non-singular, there are six kinds of the non-singular parametric domains classified by the shape ofIAkalong the boundaryΓk, illustrated in Fig. 5.Actually, for a toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)defined onIAwhereIAk∈IAandIAkis one of the above domains, we assume a lifting function which satisfies the lifting criterion onAk. Then by Theorem 3, toric surface patchBA,ω,P(u,v)has the common plane withBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak(u,v)at every point along the boundaryΓk.Without loss of generality, we assume the common boundaryΓklies on the x-axis and the k-th vertexvklies on origin.Theorem 8AsFig. 6shows, letBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)be adjacentG0continuous toric surface patches defined on adjacent convex hullIAandIA˜with the sameII-type domain along the common boundaryΓk. Then aG1sufficient condition betweenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)alongΓkisaω1,i(p1,i−p0,i)+bω0,i+1(p0,i+1−p0,i)+cω1,i⋆(p1,i⋆−p0,i)=0,a(ω1,i−ω0,i)+b(ω,0,i+1−ω0,i)+c(ω1,i⋆−ω0,i)=0,wherei=0,⋯,n−1anda,b,care arbitrary constants.On one hand, by the previous analysis, we can construct two pieces of regular control surface patchesBAk,ω|Ak,P|AkandB˜A˜k,ω˜|A˜k,P˜|A˜k. By Theorem 3,BA,ω,P(u,v)andBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak(u,v)have the same tangent plane at every point alongΓk, as wellBA˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)andB˜A˜k,ω˜|A˜k,P˜|A˜k(u,v)alongΓk.On the other hand, supposeΔ∈Z2is a finite point set, such thatA∈Δ, then we can construct a triangular lattice regionIΔwhich contains theIA, and defines a toric surface patchBΔ,ωΔ,PΔ(u,v)onIΔ. It is easy to get a lifting functionλΔwhich satisfies the lifting criterion onAk, thenBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak∈BΔ,ωΔ,PΔ(SλΔ).Then by Theorem 3,BΔ,ωΔ,PΔ(u,v)andBAk,ω|Ak,P|Ak(u,v)have the same tangent plane at every point alongΓk.Similarly, we can construct a toric surface patchB˜Δ˜,ωΔ˜,PΔ˜(u,v)onIΔ˜which containsIA˜and give a lifting functionλΔ˜which satisfies the lifting criterion onA˜k, so thatB˜A˜k,ω˜|A˜k,P˜|A˜k∈B˜Δ˜,ωΔ˜,PΔ˜(SλΔ˜).ThenB˜Δ˜,ωΔ˜,PΔ˜(u,v)andB˜A˜k,ω˜|A˜k,P˜|A˜k(u,v)have the common tangent plane at every point alongΓk.Notice thatIΔandIΔ˜are both triangular convex hull, so the toric surface patchesBΔ,ωΔ,PΔ(u,v)andBΔ˜,ωΔ˜,PΔ˜(u,v)are actually Bézier surface patches.As the above table shows, by the toric degenerations, theG1continuity problem of toric surface patchesBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)alongΓkis converted to theG1continuity problem of triangular Bézier surface patchesBΔ,ωΔ,PΔ(u,v)andB˜Δ˜,ωΔ˜,PΔ˜(u,v)alongΓk. According to Theorem 7, the result is proved.  □Theorem 9LetBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)be adjacentG0continuous toric surface patches defined onIAandIA˜with the sameII-type domain along the common boundaryΓk, asFig. 7shows, then aG1sufficient condition betweenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)alongΓkis that1.whilei=0,(ω1,0p1,0,ω1,0),(ω0,0p0,0,ω0,0),(ω0,1p0,1,ω0,1)and(ω1,0⋆p1,0⋆,ω1,0⋆)are coplanar;whilei=n,(ω1,np1,n,ω1,n),(ω0,np0,n,ω0,n),(ω1,n⋆p1,n⋆,ω1,n⋆)and(ω0,n−1p0,n−1,ω0,n−1)are coplanar;whilei=1,⋯,n−1,ω1,i⋆(p1,i⋆−p0,i)=aω1,i(p1,i−p0,i)+binω0,i−1(p0,i−p0,i−1)+c(1−in)ω0,i+1(p0,i+1−p0,i),ω1,i⋆−ω0,i=a(ω1,i−ω0,i)+bin(ω0,i−ω0,i−1)+c(1−in)(ω0,i+1−ω0,i)+dω0,i,where a, b, c and d are arbitrary constants.In fact, we can construct two tensor-product Bézier surface patchesB◊,ω◊,P◊(u,v)andB˜◊˜,ω◊˜,P◊˜(u,v)by the toric degenerations, such thatBA,ω,P(u,v)andB◊,ω◊,P◊(u,v)have the same tangent plane at every point alongΓk, as wellB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)andB˜◊,ω◊˜,P◊˜(u,v).As the above table illustrated, by Theorem 6, we could prove the above theorem directly.Theorem 10AsFig. 8shows, letBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)be adjacentG0continuous toric surface patches defined onIAwithI-type domain andIA˜withV-type domain respectively. Then aG1sufficient condition betweenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)along the common boundary is that1.whilei=0,(ω1,−1p1,−1,ω1,−1),(ω1,0p1,0,ω1,0),(ω0,1p0,1,ω0,1),(ω1,0⋆p1,0⋆,ω1,0⋆)and(ω0,0p0,0,ω0,0)are coplanar;whilei=1,⋯,n−1,aω1,i(p1,i−p0,i)+bω0,i+1(p0,i+1−p0,i)+cω1,i⋆(p1,i⋆−p0,i)=0,a(ω1,i−ω0,i)+b(ω,0,i+1−ω0,i)+c(ω1,i⋆−ω0,i)=0,wherea,band c are arbitrary constants.In fact, theV-type parametric domain can be subdivided into the union of twoI-type parametric domains, demonstrated by the red dotted line, as Fig. 8 shows. By the previous analysis, we can prove the above theorem directly.Theorem 11LetBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)be adjacentG0continuous toric surface patches defined onIAwithIII-type domain andIA˜withVI-type domain respectively, asFig. 9shows, then aG1sufficient condition betweenBA,ω,P(u,v)andB˜A˜,ω˜,P˜(u,v)along the common boundary is that1.whilei=0,(ω1,0p1,0,ω1,0),(ω0,0p0,0,ω0,0),(ω0,1p0,1,ω0,1),(ω1,−1⋆p1,−1⋆,ω1,−1⋆)and(ω1,0⋆p1,0⋆,ω1,0⋆)are coplanar;whilei=n,(ω1,np1,n,ω1,n),(ω1,n+1p1,n+1,ω1,n+1),(ω0,n−1p0,n−1,ω0,n−1),(ω0,np0,n,ω0,n),(ω1,n⋆p1,n⋆,ω1,n⋆),(ω1,n+1⋆p1,n+1⋆,ω1,n+1⋆)are coplanar;whilei=1,⋯,n−1,ω1,i⋆(p1,i⋆−p0,i)=aω1,i(p1,i−p0,i)+binω0,i−1(p0,i−p0,i−1)+c(1−in)ω0,i+1(p0,i+1−p0,i),ω1,i⋆−ω0,i=a(ω1,i−ω0,i)+bin(ω0,i−ω0,i−1)+c(1−in)(ω0,i+1−ω0,i)+dω0,i,where a, b, c and d are arbitrary constants.Actually, we can subdivide theIII-type domain into the union ofI-type andII-type domains, as Fig. 9 shows. Similarly, theVI-type domain can be subdivided into the union ofI-type,II-type andI-type.Remark 2TheG1continuity of toric surface patches defined on the other kinds of parametric domains, illustrated in Fig. 5, can be developed by an analogous deduction.Example 3As Fig. 10shows, the parametric domains have the sameII-type domain along the common boundary. According to Theorem 9, we construct two toric surface patches withG1continuity whose control points and weights satisfy the sufficient conditions.1.The control points and corresponding weights enclosed by the green lines are coplanar (see Eq. (3) and Eq. (4));The control points and corresponding weights connected by the yellow lines are colinear, the formula expressions are analogous to Eq. (3).Example 4In this example, we illustrate theG1continuity of toric surface patches with a joint point. As Fig. 11shows, the parametric domains areI-type andIII-type along the common boundary. The conditions of control points and corresponding weights are demonstrated in the center of Fig. 11 by Theorem 8 and Theorem 9:1.The control points and corresponding weights connected by the yellow lines are colinear, the formula expressions are analogous to Eq. (3);The control points and corresponding weights enclosed by the green lines are coplanar, the formula expressions are analogous to Eq. (3) and Eq. (4).Example 5In this example, we demonstrate the filling hole by a hexagonal toric surface patch, as Fig. 12shows, where the hole is formed by other six toric surface patches. The conditions of control points and corresponding weights are presented in the middle of Fig. 12. The correspondingG1continuous toric surface patches are presented on the right.Example 6We construct two pieces ofG1continuous toric surface patches to blend four pipes. As Fig. 13shows, the parametric domains of the blending surfaces are octagons, and the parametric domains of four pipes are rectangles. Fig. 13 demonstrates theG1joins of toric surface patches with four cylinderical pipes.
