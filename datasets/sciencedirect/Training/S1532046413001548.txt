@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Named entities in the biomedical domain are often written using a Noun Phrase (NP) along with a coordinating conjunction such as ‘and’ and ‘or’. In addition, repeated words among named entity mentions are frequently omitted. It is often difficult to identify named entities. Although various Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods have tried to solve this problem, these methods can only deal with relatively simple elliptical patterns in coordinated NPs. We propose a new NER method for identifying non-elliptical entity mentions with simple or complex ellipses using linguistic rules and an entity mention dictionary.The GENIA and CRAFT corpora were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The GENIA corpus was used to evaluate the performance of the system according to the quality of the dictionary. The GENIA corpus comprises 3434 non-elliptical entity mentions in 1585 coordinated NPs with ellipses. The system achieves 92.11% precision, 95.20% recall, and 93.63% F-score in identification of non-elliptical entity mentions in coordinated NPs. The accuracy of the system in resolving simple and complex ellipses is 94.54% and 91.95%, respectively. The CRAFT corpus was used to evaluate the performance of the system under realistic conditions. The system achieved 78.47% precision, 67.10% recall, and 72.34% F-score in coordinated NPs. The performance evaluations of the system show that it efficiently solves the problem caused by ellipses, and improves NER performance. The algorithm is implemented in PHP and the code can be downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/medtextmining/.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Named Entity Recognition (NER) extracts words denoting a specific target (e.g., protein or DNA) from an unstructured text. It plays a key role in various text mining applications. Named entities in the biomedical domain are often written using a Noun Phrase (NP) along with a coordinating conjunction such as ‘and’ and ‘or’. In addition, repeated words among entity mentions (an entity mention is a text string that refers to a named entity in a document) are frequently omitted. For instance, two biomedical entity mentions of ‘human T cell’ and ‘human B cell’ can be written using the coordinated NP ‘human T and B cell’. This type of omission is known as a coordination ellipsis.Coordination ellipsis makes it difficult to recognize named entities. Moreover, most of NER systems are not able to resolve non-elliptical entity mentions. However, a few NER systems [1–3] can resolve certain kinds of ellipses. For example, they are able to resolve the following type of ellipsis: ‘alpha – and beta – globin’ and ’IL-2 and -4’. However, their performance is reduced when ellipses occur in two places, such as ‘human T and B cells’. Furthermore, they cannot resolve complex ellipsis, such as ‘control, E2 – treated, and TAM – treated ER + and ER −’ (see the Section 3.1).To resolve complex ellipsis in a coordinated NP, we propose both intuitive graph-like and formal algebraic representation of a coordinated NP with ellipses. We devised a new NER method that uses linguistic rules based on the two representations. And then we developed a practical NER system that effectively identified non-elliptical entity mentions using linguistic rules and an entity mention dictionary. The system was optimized by Apriori [4] algorithm which greatly reduces processing time. The GENIA [5] and CRAFT [6,7] corpora, which consist of annotated the non-elliptical mentions of biomedical named entities, were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The GENIA corpus, which is rich in elliptical patterns, was used to evaluate the performance of the system according to the quality of the dictionary. The CRAFT corpus, which consists of full-text publications, was used to evaluate the performance of the system under realistic conditions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, we presented a new method for identifying non-elliptical entity mentions in a coordinated NP with ellipses. To resolve complex ellipsis in a coordinated NP, we propose both intuitive graph-like and formal algebraic representation of a coordinated NP with ellipses. We modeled the process of both transforming non-elliptical entity mentions into a coordinated NP, and identifying non-elliptical entity mentions from a coordinated NP algorithmically. We developed a practical NER method that uses linguistic rules based on the two representations, and optimized the system based on the Apriori algorithm which greatly reduces processing time for resolving ellipsis.The proposed system achieved 92.11% precision, 95.20% recall, and 93.63% F-score in the identification of non-elliptical entity mentions in the GENIA corpus. The system resolved simple ellipses with 94.54% accuracy, and complex ellipses with 91.95% accuracy in the GENIA corpus. Performance evaluation showed that the system could efficiently resolve both simple and complex ellipses. Under realistic conditions, the system achieved 78.47% precision, 67.10% recall, and 72.34% F-score.We tested the proposed method only in the biomedical domain. However, we are sure that the method can resolve ellipses in various domains. For this purpose, we are currently developing an automatic dictionary construction tool using large document collections, and simultaneously constructing immediately available dictionaries for ellipsis resolution in biomedical and general domains.
