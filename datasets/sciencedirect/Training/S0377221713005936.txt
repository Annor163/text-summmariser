@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models only consider the inputs supplied to the system and the outputs produced from the system in measuring efficiency, ignoring the operations of the internal processes. The results thus obtained sometimes are misleading. This paper discusses the efficiency measurement and decomposition of general multi-stage systems, where each stage consumes exogenous inputs and intermediate products (produced from the preceding stage) to produce exogenous outputs and intermediate products (for the succeeding stage to use). A relational model is developed to measure the system and stage efficiencies at the same time. By transforming the system into a series of parallel structures, the system efficiency is decomposed into the product of a modification of the stage efficiencies. Efficiency decomposition enables decision makers to identify the stages that cause the inefficiency of the system, and to effectively improve the performance of the system. An example of an electricity service system is used to explain the idea of efficiency decomposition.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an effective approach for measuring the relative efficiency of a set of decision making units (DMUs) that use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Conventionally, for systems composed of several processes, only the inputs supplied to the system and the outputs produced from the system are considered, ignoring the operations of the internal processes. A result is that, while some processes are inefficient, the system is still evaluated as efficient. In order to produce more appropriate efficiency measures, the operations of the internal processes must be taken into account.The simplest case of a system with more than one process that has been discussed in the literature is the two-stage system, where two processes are connected in series. Early works on two-stage systems calculated the two process efficiencies separately and independently by treating each stage as a DMU (Charnes et al., 1986; Lovell, Walters, & Wood, 1994; Seiford & Zhu, 1999; Wang, Gopal, & Zionts, 1997). The first attempt of taking the operations of the component processes into account in measuring the system efficiency was probably Färe (1991). Later works include Färe and Whittaker (1995), Färe and Grosskopf (1996), and Löthgren and Tambour (1999). In these studies, the process efficiencies must be calculated separately and independently. It was until Kao and Hwang (2008) that the system and process efficiencies were calculated at the same time, and the relationship that the system efficiency is the product of the process efficiencies was obtained. Based on the same idea, Chen, Cook, Ning, and Zhu (2009) developed a model which is also able to calculate the system and process efficiencies at the same time, in that the former is a weighted average of the latter. The efficiency decomposition discussed in these two studies can be extended to systems of more than two stages. With the efficiency decomposition, the processes that affect the system performance the most are identified. Making improvements in these processes will effectively improve the performance of the overall system.In the two-stage system, inputs are supplied to the first stage to produce intermediate products for the second stage to convert to final outputs. The characteristics of this type of system are that the first stage does not produce exogenous outputs and the second stage does not consume exogenous inputs. A more general situation is to relax these two restrictions, and several studies on this generalized two-stage systems have been reported (Chen, Chang, Yu, & Hsu, 2012; Chen & Guan, 2012; Kao & Hwang, 2010; Li, Chen, Liang, & Xie, 2012; Premachandra, Zhu, Watson, & Galagedera, 2012). The two-stage system with shared resources (Chen, Du, Sherman, & Zhu, 2010; Golany, Hackman, & Passy, 2006; Yu & Chen, 2011) is a variation of the general two-stage system. The model proposed by Li et al. (2012) is able to measure the system and process efficiencies at the same time, and to decompose the former into a weighted average of the latter. The idea is applicable for general multiple stage systems (Cook, Zhu, Yang, & Bi, 2010). However, the system efficiency was defined as the ratio of the aggregate output to the sum of the aggregate input and aggregate intermediate product, which is different from the conventional definition of the ratio of the aggregate output to the aggregate input (without intermediate products). In the current study, we develop a model for measuring the system and process efficiencies at the same time for general multi-stage systems. Different from the studies of Li et al. (2012) and Cook et al. (2010), the system efficiency defined in the current study is the same as the conventional definition of the ratio of the aggregate output to the aggregate input.Multi-stage systems are special cases of general network systems, and can thus be studied by the models developed for the latter. Specifically, Tone and Tsutsui (2009) applied a slacks-based measure (SBM) approach to measure the process efficiencies, and defined the system efficiency as a weighted arithmetic average of the process efficiencies in an input-oriented model and a weighted harmonic average in an output-oriented one. A non-oriented model was also proposed, in that the system efficiency is defined as a function of the input and output process efficiencies. The weights are pre-determined in these models. In the current study, rather than aggregating the process efficiencies to form the system efficiency through pre-determined weights, we will derive a relationship between the system and process efficiencies measured by the conventional definition.As far as the structure of the system is concerned, dynamic systems, where the operation of a DMU repeats from period to period and two consecutive periods are connected by carryovers, are also a type of general multi-stage system. Different models have been proposed for measuring the efficiency of these (Chen & van Dalen, 2010; Jaenicke, 2000; Kao, 2013; Nemoto & Goto, 1999; Tone & Tsutsui, 2010). Among these, the model in Kao (2013) is able to decompose the complement of the system efficiency into a linear combination of those of the process efficiencies. However, the results cannot be extended to general multi-stage systems. On the contrary, the properties obtained from multi-stage systems are applicable to dynamic ones. Most significantly, the property that the system efficiency is the product of the modified process efficiencies (Property 4 appeared in Section 4) is not observed in Kao (2013). Besides, the multi-stage model developed in this paper is also able to study series systems with shared inputs, whereas the dynamic model developed in Kao (2013) cannot.The basic idea of efficiency decomposition in this paper is to transform the general multi-stage system into a series structure, where each stage on the series has a parallel structure. Based on the efficiency decomposition for series and parallel structures, the system efficiency of a general multi-stage system can be expressed as a function of the process efficiencies. The model developed in this paper is applicable not only to standard multi-stage systems, where each stage consumes both endogenous and exogenous inputs and produces both endogenous and exogenous outputs, but also to systems with a structure resembling the general multi-stage one, such as the afore-mentioned dynamic systems and basic multi-stage systems with shared inputs.In the following sections, the model for measuring the system and process efficiencies of the general multi-stage system is first developed. Efficiency decompositions for the two basic network structures, series and parallel, are then described. After that, the method for decomposing the system efficiency of the general multi-stage system is introduced, and its extensions discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn from the discussion.Let Xij, i=1,…,m, and Yrj, r=1,…,s, denote the ith input and rth output of the jth DMU, j=1,…,n, respectively. The efficiency of the kth DMU under the assumption of constant returns to scale can be measured as (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978):(1)EkCCR=max.∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,nur,vi⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,mwhere urand viare virtual multipliers, and ε is a small non-Archimedean number imposed to avoid ignoring any factor in calculating efficiency (Charnes & Cooper, 1984). Since in this formulation the operations of the internal processes are not considered, it is referred to as a black-box model to distinguish it from the network one.The general multi-stage system is a network system composed of a number of processes connected in series, with the structure shown in Fig. 1. In this system, the first process consumes exogenous inputsXi(1), i∊I(1), supplied from outside of the system, to produce exogenous outputsYr(1), r∊O(1), as outputs of the system, and intermediate productsZf(1), f∊M(1) for the next process to use. In the subsequent processes, each process p applies exogenous inputsXi(p), i∊I(p) and intermediate productsZf(p-1), f∊M(p−1), produced by its preceding process, to produce exogenous outputsYr(p), r∊O(p) and intermediate productsZf(p), f∊M(p), for the succeeding process to use. Finally, in process q, inputs from outside,Xi(q), i∊I(q), together with intermediate productsZf(q-1), f∊M(q−1), produced by the preceding process q−1, are utilized to produce exogenous outputsYr(q), r∊O(q). The sets I(p), O(p), and M(p) contain the indices of the inputs, outputs, and intermediate products for process p, respectively.If the operations of the internal processes are ignored, then the total input supplied to the system is∑p=1qXi(p)=Xi,i=1,…,m, and the total outputs produced from the system is∑p=1qYr(p)=Yr,r=1,…,s. To measure the system and process efficiencies at the same time for general network systems, Kao (2009a) proposed a relational model which requires the same factor to have the same multiplier associated with it, no matter which process it corresponds to and whether it plays the role of input or output. Similar to the black-box model that requires the aggregate output to be less than or equal to the aggregate input for the system for each DMU, the network model additionally requires the aggregate output to be less than or equal to the aggregate input for each process. The network model for the general multi-stage system of Fig. 1 thus becomes:(2)Ek=max.∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r∈O(1)urYrj(1)+∑f∈M(1)wfZfj(1)-∑i∈I(1)viXij(1)⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r∈O(p)urYrj(p)+∑f∈M(p)wfZfj(p)-∑i∈I(p)viXij(p)+∑f∈M(p-1)wfZfj(p-1)⩽0,p=2,…,q-1,j=1,…,n∑r∈O(q)urYrj(q)-∑i∈I(q)viXij(q)+∑f∈M(q-1)wfZfj(q-1)⩽0,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾∊,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gwhere wfis the multiplier associated with the fth intermediate product.In Model (2), the sum of the constraints corresponding to the q processes is equal to the constraint corresponding to the system for each DMU j:∑r∈O(1)urYrj(1)+∑f∈M(1)wfZfj(1)-∑i∈I(1)viXij(1)+∑p=2q-1∑r∈O(p)urYrj(p)+∑f∈M(p)wfZfj(p)-∑i∈I(p)viXij(p)+∑f∈M(p-1)wfZfj(p-1)+∑r∈O(q)urYrj(q)-∑i∈I(q)viXij(q)+∑f∈M(q-1)wfZfj(q-1)=∑p=1q∑r∈O(p)urYrj(p)-∑p=1q∑i∈I(p)viXij(p)=∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXijas the intermediate products produced in each period are consumed in the next. Therefore, the constraints corresponding to the system for the n DMUs,∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0, are redundant, and can be deleted. Moreover, the slack variable associated with the system constraint, sj, will be the sum of those associated with the process constraints,sj(p),p=1,…,q.Denote (ur∗,vi∗,wf∗) as an optimal solution to Model (2), andsk∗andsk(p)∗the slack variables added to the constraints corresponding to the system and process p, respectively. The system (Ek) and process efficiencies (Ek(p)) are:Ek=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗Xik=∑r=1sur∗Yrk=1-sk∗Ek(1)=∑r∈O(1)ur∗Yrk(1)+∑f∈M(1)wf∗Zfk(1)∑i∈I(1)vi∗Xik(p)Ek(p)=∑r∈O(p)ur∗Yrk(p)+∑f∈M(p)wf∗Zfk(p)∑i∈I(p)vi∗Xik(p)+∑f∈M(p-1)wf∗Zfk(p-1),p=2,…,q-1Ek(q)=∑r∈O(q)ur∗Yrk(q)∑i∈I(q)vi∗Xik(q)+∑f∈M(q-1)wf∗Zfk(q-1)Moreover, the efficiency slack of the system is equal to the sum of those of the processes,sk∗=∑p=1qsk(p)∗,and this is a property for the general multi-stage system.Property 1For general multi-stage systems, the efficiency slack of the system is equal to the sum of those of the processes,sk∗=∑p=1qsk(p)∗.An implication of this property is that the system is efficient if and only if all the processes are. Note that whileEk=1-sk∗,it is not necessary thatEk(p)=1-sk(p)∗.Thus, a relationship between EkandEk(p)is not obtainable directly from the relationship ofsk∗=∑p=1qsk(p)∗,and other concepts must be applied.Network systems have various structures. However, there are two basic ones, series and parallel, by which any network system can be expressed. If the efficiency decompositions for these two structures are known, then those for general network systems can be obtained. In the following subsections we will discuss the efficiency decomposition for these two structures.Fig. 2shows a series structure of q processes, where the first process consumes inputs Xi, i=1,…,m, supplied from outside to produce intermediate productsZf(1), f∊M(1), for process 2 to use. In subsequent processes, every process p consumes intermediate productsZf(p-1), f∊M(p−1), produced by its preceding process p1, to produce intermediate productsZf(p), f∊M(p), for its succeeding process p+1 to use. The last process q consumes intermediate productsZf(q-1), f∊M(q−1), to produce outputs Yr, r=1,…,s. The basic multi-stage system has exactly the same structure as this.Following Kao and Hwang (2008), the relational model for measuring the system and process efficiencies for systems with this structure can be formulated as:(3)Ek=max.∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑f∈M(1)wfZfj(1)-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑f∈M(p)wfZfj(p)-∑f∈M(p-1)wfZfj(p-1)⩽0,p=2,…,q-1,j=1,…,n∑r=1surYrj-∑f∈M(q-1)wfZfj(q-1)⩽0,j=1,…,nur,vi,wf⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,m,f=1,…,gClearly, the constraints corresponding to the system are redundant, and can be deleted. At optimality, the system and process efficiencies are:Ek=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗Xik=∑r=1sur∗YrkEk(1)=∑f∈M(1)wf∗Zfk(1)∑i=1mvi∗XikEk(p)=∑f∈M(p)wf∗Zfk(p)∑f∈M(p-1)wf∗Zfk(p-1),p=2,…,q-1Ek(q)=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑f∈M(q-1)wf∗Zfk(q-1)The product of the q process efficiencies is:∏p=1qEk(p)=∑f∈M(1)wf∗Zfk(1)∑i=1mvi∗Xik∏p=2q-1∑f∈M(p)wf∗Zfk(p)∑f∈M(p-1)wf∗Zfk(p-1)∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑f∈M(q-1)wf∗Zfk(q-1)=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗Xikwhich is the system efficiency. We thus obtain the following property.Property 2The system efficiency for systems with the series structure is the product of the process efficiencies,Ek=∏p=1qEk(p).The parallel structure corresponds to systems composed of a number of processes operating independently. As shown in Fig. 3, each process p in a parallel structure of q processes consumes inputsXi(p), i∊I(p), to produce outputsYr(p), r∊O(p). The sums of the inputsXi(p)and outputsYr(p)for all q processes are the system inputs Xiand system outputs Yr, respectively, i.e.,∑p=1qXij(p)=Xijand∑p=1qYrj(p)=Yrjfor each DMU j. Kao (2009b, 2012) developed the following relational model to calculate the system and process efficiencies for a parallel system:(4)Ek=max.∑r=1surYrks.t.∑i=1mviXik=1∑r=1surYrj-∑i=1mviXij⩽0,j=1,…,n∑r∈O(p)urYrj(p)-∑i∈I(p)viXij(p)⩽0,p=1,…,q,j=1,…,nur,vi⩾ε,r=1,…,s,i=1,…,mAgain, the constraints corresponding to the system are redundant, and can be deleted.When an optimal solution (ur∗,vi∗) is obtained, the system and process efficiencies are calculated as:Ek=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗Xik=∑r=1sur∗YrkEk(p)=∑r∈O(p)ur∗Yrk(p)∑i∈I(p)vi∗Xik(p),p=1,…,qIf we define the weight associated with process p as the aggregate input consumed by this process in that consumed by all q processes,ω(p)=∑i∈I(p)vi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik, then the average of the q process efficiencies weighted by ω(p) is:∑p=1qω(p)Ek(p)=∑p=1q∑i∈I(p)vi∗Xik(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik∑r∈O(p)ur∗Yrk(p)∑i∈I(p)vi∗Xik(p)=∑p=1q∑r∈O(p)ur∗Yrk(p)∑i=1mvi∗Xik=∑r=1sur∗Yrk∑i=1mvi∗Xikwhich is the system efficiency. This is a property of a parallel system.Property 3The system efficiency for systems of q processes with the parallel structure is a weighted average of the q process efficiencies,Ek=∑p=1qω(p)Ek(p),∑p=1qω(p)=1andω(p)⩾0,p=1,…,q.To decompose the system efficiency of a general network system, one approach is to transform the system into one of either a series or a parallel of subsystems, where each subsystem has either a series or a parallel structure. The efficiency decomposition for the original system can then be obtained based on the efficiency decompositions for series and parallel structures,The key to decompose the system efficiency of a general multi-stage system is to find a transformation of series and parallel structures. Since the notation used with a general multi-stage system is so complicated, we will use an example to explain this, and then extend the results to general cases.Consider the electricity service system discussed in Tone and Tsutsui (2009), with the structure shown in Fig. 4. At the beginning, electric power is generated in the Generation Division (Process 1). The generated power is then sent to the Distribution Division (Process 2), where a portion is sold to large customers and the remaining amount sent to the Transmission Division (Process 3). The Transmission Division finally provides the electricity to small customers. In Tone and Tsutsui (2009), only one input, employees, is considered for all three processes. To make the problem more general, we assume the employees in the three divisions require different skills, and are thus treated as different inputs. Similarly, although the two intermediate products, Z1 and Z2, and the two outputs, Y2 and Y3, are of the same product, electricity, we assume they are of different forms, and should be treated as different products to make the problem more general.Tone and Tsutsui (2009) developed three SBM models to measure the system and process efficiencies for general network systems. In this example, only the input-oriented model was applied to obtain a solution. Basically, the slacks of the inputs, i.e., the amounts that can be reduced, divided by the inputs used are measures of inefficiency. The system efficiency was calculated as the average of the three process efficiencies weighted by 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively.In this study, following Model (2), and adding slack variables to the constraints, the model for calculating the system and process efficiencies for this system is:(5)Ek=max.u2Y2k+u3Y3ks.t.v1X1k+v2X2k+v3X3k=1(u2Y2j+u3Y3j)-(v1X1j+v2X2j+v3X3j)+sj=0,j=1,…,nw1Z1j-v1X1j+sj(1)=0,j=1,…,nu2Y2j+w2Z2j-(v2X2j+w1Z1j)+sj(2)=0,j=1,…,nu3Y3j-(v3X3j+w2Z2j)+sj(3)=0,j=1,…,nu2,u3,v1,v2,v3,w1,w2⩾εAt optimality, the system and process efficiencies are:Ek=u2∗Y2k+u3∗Y3kv1∗X1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3kEk(1)=w1∗Z1kv1∗X1k,Ek(2)=u2∗Y2k+w2∗Z2kv2∗X2k+w1∗Z1k,Ek(3)=u3∗Y3kv3∗X3k+w2∗Z2kTo transform a general network system to one of series and parallel structures, Kao (2009a) suggests using the longest path of processes in the system as the backbone of the transformed system, and to introduce dummy processes to carry the inputs and outputs of intermediate processes. A dummy process has the same inputs and outputs, and they are used only to help the representation. For the general multi-stage system there is only one path, the series of q processes. At each stage, one dummy process, connected in parallel with a real process, is added to carry the inputs to be used in later stages and the outputs produced in previous stages. Fig. 5shows such a transformation of the system in Fig. 4, where squares and circles represent the real and dummy processes, respectively.The transformed system has three subsystems connected in series, with each one corresponding to one process. The efficiency of each subsystem is the aggregate output divided by the aggregate input:EkI=w1∗Z1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3kv1∗X1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3kEkII=w2∗Z2k+u2∗Y2k+v3∗X3kw1∗Z1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3kEkIII=u2∗Y2k+u3∗Y3kw2∗Z2k+v3∗X3k+u2∗Y2kTheir product is exactly the system efficiency, obeying Property 2. To ensure the subsystem efficiency is less than or equal to one, the aggregate output of each subsystem must be no greater than the aggregate input:(w1Z1j+v2X2j+v3X3j)-(v1X1j+v2X2j+v3X3j)⩽0(w2Z2j+u2Y2j+v3X3j)-(w1Z1j+v2X2j+v3X3j)⩽0(u2Y2j+u3Y3j)-(w2Z2j+v3X3j+u2Y2j)⩽0By eliminating identical terms, these three constraints are exactly those corresponding to the three processes formulated in Model (5).Each of the three subsystems has a parallel structure composed of one real and one dummy process. Since the inputs and outputs of a dummy process are the same, the associated constraint is redundant, and the efficiency score is one. According to Property 3, the efficiency of each subsystem is a weighted average of the real and dummy process efficiencies:EkI=ω(1)Ek(1)+ω(4)Ek(4)=ω(1)Ek(1)+(1-ω(1))EkII=ω(2)Ek(2)+ω(5)Ek(5)=ω(2)Ek(2)+(1-ω(2))EkIII=ω(3)Ek(3)+ω(6)Ek(6)=ω(3)Ek(3)+(1-ω(3))whereω(1)=v1∗X1k/(v1∗X1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3k)ω(2)=(w1∗Z1k+v2∗X2k)/(w1∗Z1k+v2∗X2k+v3∗X3k)ω(3)=(w2∗Z2k+v3∗X3k)/(w2∗Z2k+v3∗X3k+u2∗Y2k)To summarize, the network model for the transformed system of Fig. 5 is the same as that for the original system of Fig. 4. The system efficiency is the product of the three subsystem efficiencies, and the efficiency of each subsystem is a weighted average of the efficiency of the corresponding process and one. In symbols, we haveEk=EkI×EkII×EkIII=[ω(1)Ek(1)+(1-ω(1))][ω(2)Ek(2)+(1-ω(2))][ω(3)Ek(3)+(1-ω(3))]. This result can be extended to general cases of q stages with more inputs, outputs, and intermediate products to have the following property.Property 4The system efficiency for general multi-stage systems of q processes is the product of the q modified process efficiencies, where the modified process efficiency is a weighted average of the process efficiency and one. In symbols, it isEk=∏p=1q[ω(p)Ek(p)+(1-ω(p))].Since the modified process efficiency, or subsystem efficiency, is a weighted average of the process efficiency and one, it is always greater than or equal to the process efficiency. How close these two efficiencies are depends on how close the process efficiency and the weight are to one.As an illustration, consider ten DMUs with the data taken from Tone and Tsutsui (2009), which is also shown in Table 1. By treating the system as a black-box and applying Model (1), the efficiencies of the ten DMUs are calculated, as shown in the second column of Table 2, where five DMUs, C, D, G, H, and I, are efficient. When the operations of the three processes are taken into account and Model (5) is applied, none is found to be efficient (referring to the efficiency scores in the third column of Table 2). Note that the efficiency score of DMU C is not equal to one, although it is very close to one. The five DMUs evaluated by the black-box model as efficient are still the best five as evaluated by the network model. However, the network model is able to distinguish their ranks. The ranks of the other five DMUs are the same as evaluated by the two models, except the ranks of DMUs A and B are switched. In this regard, the network model is more discriminative than the black-box one.The last three double-columns of Table 2 show the results of the three processes calculated from the network model. For each process, the first number in the first row of a DMU is the efficiency of the corresponding subsystem and the second number, in parentheses, is the efficiency slack. According to Property 1, the efficiency slack of the system must be equal to the sum of those of the component processes. Using DMU A to explain this, the efficiency slack of the system is 0.6175, which is exactly the sum of 0.4, 0.2119, and 0.0056. Another property to be checked is Property 2, which requires the system efficiency to be equal to the product of the subsystem efficiencies. For DMU A, the former is 0.3825, while the latter is 0.6×0.6468×0.9857, which clearly satisfies this property. The two numbers in the second row are the process efficiency and the associated weight for each DMU. According to Property 3, the subsystem efficiency must be a weighted average of the process efficiencies. In this example, every subsystem is composed of a real and a dummy process. The weighted average of the efficiencies of processes 1 and 4 for DMU A is 0.6775×0.4096+(1−0.6775), or 0.6, which is exactly the efficiency of Subsystem I. Similarly, for Subsystems II and III, we have 0.6468=0.9964×0.6455+(1−0.9964) and 0.9857=0.4960×0.9711+(1−0.4960), respectively.The SBM model used in Tone and Tsutsui (2009) is input-oriented, in that only the slacks associated with the inputs are considered in measuring efficiencies. Moreover, the returns to scale are assumed to be variable, as opposed to constant of the current study. For these two reasons, the results from these two studies are not comparable, and it is expected that the efficiency scores measured by Tone and Tsutsui (2009) should in general be greater than those measured in this study. This is confirmed by observing that only four out of thirty efficiency scores (ten DMUs, each with three processes) measured by Tone and Tsutsui (2009) are smaller than those measured in this study.Efficiency decomposition can be used to inform decision makers which processes cause inefficiency in a system. For example, the inefficiency of DMU A is primarily due to processes 1 and 2 (referring to the results in Table 2). Making improvements in these processes will effectively improve the performance of the system.Many real world problems have a structure that resembles that of the general multi-stage system. Dynamic systems, where the operation of a DMU repeats from period to period and two consecutive periods are connected by carryovers, are typical examples. Fig. 6shows the structure of a dynamic system. In each period p, inputsXi(p), i=1,…,m, supplied from outside, and carryoversZf(p-1), f=1,…,g, carried from the preceding period, are used to produce exogenous outputsYr(p), r=1,…,s, and carryoversZf(p), f=1,…,g, for the next period to use.Different from the general multi-stage system, all inputsXi(p), outputsYr(p), and intermediate products (carryovers)Zf(p)are respectively the same for all periods in the dynamic system. In this regard, the dynamic system is a simplification of the general multi-stage one. However, the general multi-stage system does not have the initial, nor the terminal, intermediate products. The initial intermediate productsZf(0)in the dynamic system must thus be treated as a different type of input for the first period and the terminal intermediate productsZf(q)are treated as a special type of output for the last period in order to conform to the structure of the general multi-stage system.Several studies have discussed the efficiency measurement of dynamic systems. Kao (2013) used Property 1,sk∗=∑p=1qsk(p)∗,to derive a relationship between the complement of the efficiency of the system and those of the processes. According to Property 4, the q-period efficiency of a dynamic system is actually the product of a modification of the q period-specific efficiencies. This indicates that the inefficiency of a period has a multiplication effect, rather than an additive one, with regard to the overall efficiency of the q periods. Decision makers must therefore be aware that the case of a sharp drop in the efficiency in one period is generally more serious than that of a moderate drop in every period.Another type of problem that is widely discussed in the literature, and which can also be classified as a general multi-stage system, is a basic multi-stage system with shared resources. Fig. 7shows such a system, where Xi, i=1,…,m, are the regular inputs supplied to the first process for production. Different from the standard multi-stage system, there are another type of resourcesXtS, t=1,…,h, to be shared among q processes. In this type of problem, the aim is to find the optimal portionsρt(p)of the resourceXtSthat need to be allocated in each period to produce the highest efficiency score.Two differences are noted in comparing Figs. 7 to 1. The first is that the former does not have exogenous outputs for processes 1 through q−1, and the second is that it additionally requires∑p=1qρt(p)=1. Chen et al. (2010) developed a model for decomposing the efficiencies of a general two-stage system, where the system efficiency was defined differently from the conventional definition. To conform to the conventional definition, Model (2) in this paper can be modified to measure the system and process efficiencies, and to express the former as a function of the latter.
