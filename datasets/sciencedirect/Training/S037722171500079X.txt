@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive traffic control on single junctions with the three following objectives to be minimized: the total waiting time and the number of stops for private vehicles, and a public transport criterion. This problem being modeled as a multi-objective mixed integer linear program, we provide an interactive system based on an adaptive reference point approach. This system adapts, in real-time, priorities given to the different criteria according to the traffic situation. Formal guarantees are provided on the behavior of our system. A comparison with a standard semi-adaptive system on a simulated traffic shows that it provides significantly better solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of traffic control at single junctions can be seen as the management of access to a specific space, the junction, by different types of users. These users cannot access simultaneously the junction for security reasons and the access rules are generally defined depending on the junction characteristics. The traffic light control problem we consider consists in finding in “real-time”, on a single junction, an appropriate plan of traffic lights states, according to several criteria, over a time horizon.Traffic control has been well-studied for the last 50 years, and a lot of methods and systems were developed to handle this problem, with different levels of adaptability. Such systems can be classified into the following three categories. Non-adaptive systems aim at building signal planning for a fixed-time use, see e.g. Cantarella and Improta (1984); 1988); Webster (1958); Wong and Wong (2003) for single-objective systems and Reljic (1996); Robertson (1969); Wong (1997) for systems with several criteria. Semi-adaptive systems aim at partially adapting an initial signal timing to the traffic situation, without being able to change it radically in real-time, see e.g. Dotoli, Fanti, and Meloni (2006); Lowrie (1982); Wey (2000) for single-objective systems and Bretherton (2007); Bretherton and Browen (1990); Garcia-Nieto, Olivera, and Alba (2013); Head and Mirchandani (2001); Kachroudi and Bhouri (2009); Li, Yu, Tao, and Chen (2013); Schöcker, Ahuja, and Bell (2008) for systems with several criteria. Finally, adaptive systems are able to totally adapt the signal timing to the traffic situation, see e.g. Boillot, Midenet, and Pierrelée (2006); Boumghar (2000); Cai, Wong, and Heydecker (2009); Farges, Henry, and Tuffal (1983) for single-objective systems and Coll, Factorovich, Loiseau, and Gómez (2013); Khamis and Gomaa (2014); Li, Canepa, and Claudel (2014) for multi-objective ones. Systems belonging to the second and third categories are generally real-time systems, since they rely on information about the traffic situation provided regularly by some sensors. The system we developed belongs to the third category.Most real-time urban traffic control strategies were developed to minimize a single objective (the total waiting time of private vehicles) or a simpleweighted sum of several objectives, where the weights are fixed a priori. Our approach does not use such an a priori aggregation, but aims at adapting the traffic control policy to the current traffic situation. This is achieved by adjusting the priorities given to the criteria depending on the traffic situation.The considered criteria are the total waiting time (WT) and the total number of stops (NS) for private vehicles, and the total “error on requested waiting times” (ERB) for public transport vehicles (buses), where the term “total” means a sum over all vehicles. These three criteria reflect three important issues in traffic control: traffic fluidity, environmental aspects, and development of public transport. Criterion WT is a standard measure of traffic fluidity. Environmental aspects focusing on the reduction of pollutant emissions depend on criterion WT but also on criterion NS. Defining this second criterion is thus a way of emphasizing environmental aspects. Criterion ERB, which measures the respect of time schedules, favors the use and development of public transport.Every criterion is to be minimized, and is taken into account in a multi-objective mixed integer linear program embedded in an interactive real-time and adaptive multi-objective system based on a reference point approach. This procedure adapts the traffic control policy depending on the current traffic situation.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a general description of the problem and a comparison of different mixed integer linear program (MILP) that we experimented. Section 3 focuses on the interactive procedure, and shows that it satisfies some desirable formal properties. Experimental results illustrating the adaptive capacities of the system are reported in Section 4. Conclusions and perspectives are provided in a final section.The traffic control problem we are interested in takes place at a given junction. It can be described as follows: every fixed time step, we want to find the best possible traffic light switchover planning over a given horizon, according to the three criteria previously defined and a measure of the ‘traffic situation’. The traffic situation provides a set of indicators used to adapt in real time the relative importance of the criteria. This defines an evolutive traffic control policy. The way of adapting a traffic control, depending on the traffic situation, is controlled by rules, called policy evolution rules, that will be defined formally in Section 3.1.We call section a lane related to a traffic light (it could be directional). We suppose that we are able to know, at any time, every queue length and arrival flows of private vehicles on every section, every previous traffic lights switchover dates, and every bus position. The project related to this research commonly uses video based measurements like queue lengths, spatial occupancies etc. This is the reason why we consider in this paper that this information is available. Nevertheless, if no camera is available on an intersection, it is possible to estimate approximately this information from loop detectors as, e.g., in the PRODYN traffic control system Farges et al. (1983).Regarding buses, the knowledge of the bus positions makes it possible to calculate every eventual bus arrival date on the junction during the time horizon. Moreover, we suppose that the bus company indicates, for each bus, a reference date at which it should cross the junction. Criterion ERB is then defined as the sum, over the approaching buses, of the absolute difference between the reference date and the actual crossing date of the junction for each bus.Finally we consider only red and green states as decision variables, with given fixed minimum and maximum red and green durations. Amber state has usually a fixed duration, and can be included just before the end of optimal green periods of every traffic light. We consider as given and fixed the set of all antagonist pairs of traffic lights. Two traffic lights are considered as antagonist if they cannot be in a green state at the same moment.Note that no traffic light switchover order is supposed a priori, which classifies our proposed system as an adaptive system. Moreover, it is a real-time system. Once the best planning is computed, only the part corresponding to the first next time step is sent to the controller to be implemented. During this time step we compute the best next planning according to the new traffic situation, and so on. Each such step is called an iteration, and corresponds to an iteration of a multi-objective interactive optimization procedure.At every iteration we need to solve a multiobjective MILP in order to find the best planning. Different MILP models, which are described in Section 2.3, have been experimented and compared. One of these, called the ‘hybrid model’, has been selected for reasons explained in Section 2.3.In order to take into account the three criteria and a traffic control policy, the MILP uses, as an objective function, a parametrized aggregation function, based on a reference point approach and called achievement function (see Gardiner and Vanderpooten (1997); Vanderpooten (1989); Vanderpooten and Vincke (1985), or Section 3.2 for more details). We use the following standard achievement function to be minimized:maxcrit=WT,NS,ERB{λcrit(crit−crit¯)}+ρ∑crit=WT,NS,ERBλcrit(crit−crit¯)where WT, ~NS, ~ERB are the three criteria, ρ > 0 is a very small real number, λWT, ~λNS, ~λERB are normalizing parameters, andWT¯,NS¯,ERB¯are preference parameters indicating the values to be achieved on the respective criteria.Optimizing this function guarantees to return an efficient solution (i.e. efficient planning) at every iteration. An efficient solution is a solution that cannot be improved on one criterion without deteriorating at least another criterion value.This function is used iteratively, by varying the preference parameters, within an interactive procedure. Unlike in standard interactive procedures, preference parameters are not defined by a decision maker, but by the policy evolution rules depending on the traffic situation.Fig. 1summarizes the general structure of the system including the interactive procedure.Three alternative MILP models were developed and tested, which are precisely described in Dujardin (2013); Dujardin, Boillot, Vanderpooten, and Vinant (2011). Each model is based on a macroscopic modeling for the private vehicles and on a microscopic modeling for the public transport part.The first one, called “state model” consists in associating a binary variable to every traffic light and every discretized moment of the time horizon. These variables indicate the red or green state of the corresponding traffic lights. This type of model is well-known in scheduling theory and called ”discrete time model” (see Floudas and Lin (2005), Section 1.2).The second one, called “date model”, consists in associating a continuous variable to every traffic light and every switchover dates occurring during the time horizon. This type of model is called ”event based model” in scheduling theory (see Floudas and Lin (2005), Section 1.3).The goal of this section is not to give a precise mathematical description of these two models but to give their main features and the reasons why a third ”hybrid” model was relevant to consider given their natural complementarity, in term of number of variables and linearity.In both cases two types of constraints have to be taken into account: antagonisms between certain pairs of traffic lights and minimum and maximum red and green duration.The number of required binary variables to represent the constraints may vary significantly depending on the model and the type of constraints (see Table 1). The number of binary variables is a critical indicator of a MILP “complexity”, in the sense that usually the solution time depends highly on this number.The way of modeling each criterion may also vary significantly depending on the model (see Table 2). The resulting effort to obtain a linear formulation also gives indirectly a hint on the “complexity” of each model.The italics in Tables 1 and 2 indicate the most interesting formulations.A third model was developed and was called “hybrid model” since it uses simultaneously the two types of main variables, traffic lights states at every time unit and traffic lights switchover dates. The hybrid model can therefore use the most interesting formulation for every constraint and criterion – corresponding to the italics in Tables 1 and 2.The three models have been compared so as to select the one which would perform better within the interactive procedure. For this purpose, we experimented the three models on the junction described in Section 4.1 (see Fig. 2) using 486 instances generated by varying independently:•The total time limit imposed to the solver to optimize.The type of traffic, depending on arrival flows: fluid, dense or asymmetric. Asymmetric traffic occurs when arrival flows can be significantly different depending on the section.The buses presence: either no bus is planned or conflicting buses from different sections are planned.The traffic control policy: it basically changes the chosen compromise between the different criteria, and thus the objective function.Table 3gives the average value of the achievement function when optimized with an MILP solver (we used CPLEX, version 12.2, on a computer with an Intel Core 2 duo CPU 1.8 GHz, 2 Go RAM). Since the achievement function is to be minimized, the smaller the value, the better the performance. Moreover, small optimization limits are particularly important since the system is to be used in real time.The hybrid model clearly outperforms the two other models. It has been thus chosen to be the MILP model used iteratively in our interactive system.This section describes the proposed interactive procedure, which is guided by policy evolution rules taking into account the traffic situation in real-time, in order to adapt priorities given to the criteria.The definition of a traffic control policy first requires to be able to assess the current traffic situation at any time. This assessment could be made through the criterion values of the current solution. However, traffic managers often resort to the two following indicators to assess the traffic situation.Arrival rate. If we denote by L the set of the traffic lights of the junction, we suppose that for every l ∈ L we know an upper boundQAlmaxof traffic flow on the section corresponding to l. Then, for every moment t, the arrival rate τA(t) is defined as:τA(t)=1Δt0∑t′=t−Δt0t∑l∈LQAl(t′)∑l∈LQAlmaxwhere QAl(t′) is the arrival flow given by the sensor at moment t′ on the section corresponding to the traffic light l, and Δt0 > 0 is an arbitrary duration. Calculation of the rate takes into account past information so as to reduce the impact of isolated fluctuations.Queue spillbacks. For a given section of the junction, we say that there is a queue spillback on this section, at a given moment, if the queue length on this section exceeds the section length on average during a certain time.The policy evolution rules, based on these two indicators, can be designed according to the three following general principles:1.When the traffic situation is dense or with queue spillbacks (situation denoted by SWT), the minimization of the criterion WT is highly desirable, particularly not to let the situation lead to a blockade of the junction, which finally would impact negatively every criterion.When the traffic situation is flowing without any queue spillback (situation denoted bySWT¯), priority is given to the criterion reflecting an environmental preoccupation NS and the criterion for public transport ERB.In intermediate traffic situations, the three criteria are considered with an emphasis on criterion WT when the traffic becomes dense, and on criteria NS and ERB when the traffic becomes flowing.The multi-objective model to be solved has the general following form:minz1=f1(x),⋯,zp=fp(x)(P)s.t.x∈Xwhere fj, j = 1, …, p, p ≥ 2, are linear objective functions and X is the set of feasible solutions.LetZ⊂Zpbe the criterion space, and ZXbe the image of X in Z, also called set of feasible points. For every z, z′ ∈ Z we use the following notations:•z′≦z if and only if for allj∈{1,…,p},zj′≤zjz′ ≤ z if and only if z′ ≤ z and there existsk∈{1,…,p}suchthatzk′<zkz′ < z if and only if for allj∈{1,…,p},zj′<zjA point z ∈ ZXis said to be non-dominated if there is no z′ ∈ ZXsuch that z′ ≤ z. The set of non-dominated points will be denoted by ND(ZX). Finally, let z* and z* denote the ideal and anti-ideal points with coordinateszj*=minx∈Xfj(x)and z*j= maxx ∈ Xfj(x), j = 1, …, p.The information provided to the model in order to determine compromise solutions are aspiration valuesz¯jon each criterion fj, j = 1, …, p. The corresponding reference point (RP)z¯reflects the priorities of each criterion as defined by the traffic control policy.A well-known family of aggregation function making use of reference points has been introduced in Wierzbicki (1986); 1980). Among these, we consider the standard augmented achievement function (already briefly introduced in Section 2.2).sz¯,λ(z)=maxj=1,…,p{λj(zj−z¯j)}+ρ∑j=1,…,pλj(zj−z¯j)where ρ > 0, λj> 0, j = 1, …, p.The weighting vector λ is chosen such thatλj=1Mj−mj,j = 1, …, p, where m < M and m≦z≦M for all z ∈ ZX. A usual choice is to set m = z* and M = z*.In our specific context, (P) corresponds to the hybrid model described in Section 2.3, with p = 3, z1 = WT, z2 = NS and z3 = ERB.Policy evolution rules aim at defining, at each iteration, the reference pointz¯according to the current traffic situation. These rules implement the three principles given at the end of Section 3.1.For this purpose, we need first to define two RPs corresponding to the extreme situations SWT andSWT¯. A natural way to do this is to consider that:•in the situation SWT, we setz¯=zSWT=(mWT,MNS,MERB)in the situationSWT¯,we setz¯=zSWT¯=(MWT,mNS,mERB)Observe that, at each iteration, the set of feasible solutions is modified due to the evolution of the traffic. Therefore the ideal and anti-ideal points may also evolve. In order to avoid recomputing these points at each iteration, we consider respectively as points m and M, the ideal point when the instance is the most favorable and the anti-ideal point when the instance is the less favorable, based on a history. This way, points m and M correspond to reasonable lower and upper bounds on the criterion values.For the intermediate cases, between SWT andSWT¯,we propose to integrate the two traffic situation indicators as follows: if there is no queue spillback (the corresponding indicator is equal to 0),z¯=τA×zSWT+(1−τA)zSWT¯,where τAis the arrival flow rate at the moment when we want to revisez¯.The traffic control policy emphasizes the role played by one criterion, namely criterion WT, whereas the other criteria are considered together. For this reason, rather than using functionsz¯,λ,we use a slightly different aggregation functionhz¯,λwhich will allow us to satisfy some desirable properties, as shown on the next section.(1)hz¯,λ(z)=maxj∈J{λj(zj−z¯j)}+ρ1λ1(z1−z¯1)+ρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)where J = {1, …, p}, andJ1¯=J∖{1}.A first type of requirement refers to the ability of the aggregation function to investigate the set of non-dominated points Wierzbicki (1986). More precisely, we wish to prove that:•R1: Any optimal solution ofhz¯,λcorresponds to a non-dominated point,R2: Any non-dominated point can be reached by solvinghz¯,λfor at least one reference pointz¯,The second type of requirement refers to the consistency between the evolution of the reference point and the evolution of the returned solution. Consider the general case with p criteria, where criterion 1 plays the role of criterion WS and the p − 1 other criteria play the same role as criteria NS and ERB. The extreme RPs are thenzS1=(m1,M2,M3,…,Mp)andzS1¯=(M1,m2,m3,…,mp),where m, M ∈ Z are such that m < M and m≦z≦M for all z ∈ ZX. The third requirement can thus be stated as follows:•R3•(i) a modification of the current RP, from one iteration to the next one, to a RP which is closer to S1, implies that the new solution is at least as good as the current solution on criterion 1(ii) Reciprocally, a modification of the current RP, from one iteration to the next one, to a RP which is closer toS1¯,implies that the new solution is at least as good as the current solution on one of the other criteria.These three requirements are proved respectively in Propositions 3, 4, and 5. For this purpose, we first introduce a preliminary result which makes use of the following function:gz¯,λ(z)=maxj∈Jλj(zj−z¯j)Lemma 1Letλ∈R>0p. There existρ1,ρ1¯∈R>0such that, for everyz¯∈Z,and z, z′ ∈ ZX, we havehz¯,λ(z)>hz¯,λ(z′)if and only if one of the following statements is true:(2)gz¯,λ(z)>gz¯,λ(z′)(3)gz¯,λ(z)=gz¯,λ(z′)andz1>z1′(4)gz¯,λ(z)=gz¯,λ(z′),z1=z1′,and∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)>∑j∈J1¯λj(zj′−z¯j)Letλ∈R>0p. Since ZXis finite (discrete and bounded), and Z is discrete, the setAλ={gz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)|gz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)>0,(z,z′,z¯)∈ZX2×Z}is finite. Moreover Aλis non-empty because we havegz¯,λ(M)−gz¯,λ(m)>0for everyz¯∈Z(indeed, mj< Mjfor every j ∈ J). Thus, Aλadmits a smallest element mλ> 0. Letρ1,ρ1¯∈R>0be such that:(5)ρ1<mλλ1(M1−m1)andρ1¯<min{ρ1λ1,mλ−ρ1λ1(M1−m1)}∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj)For the rest of the proof we consider(z,z′,z¯)∈ZX2×Z.We first consider the sufficient part.Assuming that (2) is true, we havegz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)≥mλ,which giveshz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)≥mλ+ρ1λ1(z1−z1′)+ρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−zj′). Sincezj−zj′≥mj−Mjfor every j ∈ J, we gethz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)≥mλ−ρ1λ1(M1−m1)−ρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj). By definition ofρ1¯,we haveρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj)<mλ−ρ1λ1(M1−m1),which implieshz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)>0.Assuming now that (3) is true, we havez1≥z1′+1,which giveshz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)≥ρ1λ1−ρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj). By definition ofρ1¯,we haveρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj)<ρ1λ1,which implieshz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)>0.Finally, assuming that (4) is true, we havehz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)=∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)−∑j∈J1¯λj(zj′−z¯j)>0.We consider now the necessary part.Suppose that none of the three statements (2), (3), or (4) is true.We havehz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)=gz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)+ρ1λ1(z1−z1′)+ρ1¯∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−zj′).Statement (2) being false, eithergz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)<0orgz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)=0. Ifgz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)<0,we havegz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)≤−mλand using the same reasoning as in the positive case we gethz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)<0. Ifgz¯,λ(z)−gz¯,λ(z′)=0,then, since statement (3) is false, we havez1≤z1′. Ifz1<z1′,the same reasoning as in the positive case provideshz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)<0. Finally, ifz1=z1′,then, since statement (4) is false, we have∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)≤∑j∈J1¯λj(zj′−z¯j),and thushz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)=∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)−∑j∈J1¯λj(zj′−z¯j)≤0.Finally we always havehz¯,λ(z)−hz¯,λ(z′)≤0.□Letλ∈R>0pand letρ1,ρ1¯∈R>0be defined by (5). For everyz¯∈Z,and z, z′ ∈ ZX,hz¯,λ(z)=hz¯,λ(z′)is equivalent to:(6)(gz¯,λ(z)=gz¯,λ(z′))∧(z1=z1′)∧(∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)=∑j∈J1¯λj(zj′−z¯j))For everyz¯∈Z,z, z′ ∈ ZX, ifhz¯,λ(z)=hz¯,λ(z′),we have simultaneously¬(hz¯,λ(z)<hz¯,λ(z′))and¬(hz¯,λ(z)<hz¯,λ(z′)). Using the negation of Lemma 1 for the corresponding statements leads to statement (6). The converse is obvious.□Letλ∈R>0pand letρ1,ρ1¯∈R>0such thatρ1<mλλ1(M1−m1)andρ1¯<min{ρ1λ1,mλ−ρ1λ1(M1−m1)}∑j∈J1¯λj(Mj−mj),where mλis defined in the proof of Lemma 1. From now on, these quantities are considered as fixed.Proposition 3For everyz¯∈Z,for everyz^∈argminz∈ZXhz¯,λ(z),we havez^∈ND(ZX).Assume by contradiction that there exists z ∈ ZXwhich dominatesz^. Thenzj≤z^j,j∈Jand there exists j ∈ J such thatzj<z^j. In particular we havegz¯,λ(z)≤gz¯,λ(z^)and∑j∈Jλjzj<∑j∈Jλjz^j. Thus, we havegz¯,λ(z)≤gz¯,λ(z^)and(z1<z^1or∑j∈J1¯λj(zj−z¯j)<∑j∈J1¯λj(z^j−z¯j)). Then, by Lemma 1 we gethz¯,λ(z)<hz¯,λ(z^),which contradictsz^∈argminz∈ZXhz¯,λ(z). Thus, for every z ∈ ZXsuch thatz≠z^,z does not dominatez^. Soz^∈ND(ZX).□Every z ∈ ND(ZX) can be generated as a solution ofminz∈ZXhz¯,λ(z),wherez¯∈Z.Let z ∈ ND(ZX). We setz¯=z. Then we havehz¯,λ(z)=0,andgz¯,λ(z)=0. Suppose that there exists z′ ∈ ZX, such thathz¯,λ(z′)<0. Then we have in particularhz¯,λ(z′)<hz¯,λ(z). It follows from Lemma 1 that we have eithergz¯,λ(z′)<gz¯,λ(z),or(gz¯,λ(z′)=gz¯,λ(z)andz1′<z1),or(gz¯,λ(z′)=gz¯,λ(z),z^1=z1and∑j∈J1¯λjzj′<∑j∈J1¯λjzj)In the first case, we havegz¯,λ(z′)<0,that ismaxj∈Jλj(zj′−z¯j)<0. It follows that for each j ∈ J,λj(zj′−z¯j)<0and thereforezj′<z¯j,since λj> 0. Sincez¯=z,we then have z′ < z, which contradicts z ∈ ND(ZX).In the second case we have in particulargz¯,λ(z′)=gz¯,λ(z)=0. Thus, using the same reasoning than in the first case we havezj′≤zj,j∈J. Moreover, we havez1′<z1. So we have z′ ≤ z, which contradicts again z ∈ ND(ZX).In the third case we have in particular∑j∈J1¯λjzj′<∑j∈J1¯λjzj,which implies that there exists j ∈ J such thatzj′<z¯j. We have alsogz¯,λ(z′)=0,which implies thatzj′≤z¯j,j∈J,which proves that z′ ≤ z, which contradicts z ∈ ND(ZX).Finally, there is no z′ ∈ ZXsuch thathz¯,λ(z′)<0. So z ∈ ND(ZX) can be generated as a solution ofminz∈ZXhz¯,λ(z).□Letz¯=(z¯1,…,z¯p)andz¯′=(z¯1′,…,z¯p′)be two points belonging to Z such thatz¯j′=z¯j,j∈J1¯.Letz^andz^′be two solutions of (P) using respectivelyhz¯,λandhz¯′,λas aggregation functions.(a) ifz¯1′≤z¯1,thenz^′1≤z^1.(b) ifz¯1′≥z¯1,then there existsj∈J1¯such thatz^′j≤z^j.(a) From the definition ofz^′we havehz¯′,λ(z^)≥hz¯′,λ(z^′). Ifhz¯′,λ(z^)=hz¯′,λ(z^′),then, by Corollary 2, we getz^1=z^1′and thusz^1′≤z^1.We then consider thathz¯′,λ(z^)>hz¯′,λ(z^′). From Lemma 1 we have three possible statements (2), (3), or (4). In cases (3) or (4) we have clearlyz^1′≤z^1.Consider case (2), wheregz¯′,λ(z^)>gz¯′,λ(z^′).LetJ^z¯′=argmaxj∈Jλj(z^j−z¯j′). We will consider two sub-cases:1∈J^z¯′and1∉J^z¯′.If1∈J^z¯′,inequality (2) is equivalent toλ1(z^1−z¯1′)>gz¯′,λ(z^′). Sincegz¯′,λ(z^′)=maxj∈Jλj(z^′j−zj′),we havegz¯′,λ(z^′)≥λ1(z^1′−z¯1′)and thusλ1(z^1−z¯1′)>λ1(z^1′−z¯1′). This leads toz^1>z^1′and thusz^1′≤z^1.If1∉J^z¯′,letk∈J^z¯′. Thengz¯′,λ(z^)=λk(z^k−z¯k′)=λk(z^k−z¯k)since k ≠ 1. Butλk(z^k−z¯k)≤gz¯,λ(z^)becausegz¯,λ(z^)=maxj∈Jλj(z^j−zj). Thus we getgz¯′,λ(z^)≤gz¯,λ(z^). Combining this inequality with (2), we obtaingz¯,λ(z^)>gz¯′,λ(z^′). Since we havegz¯,λ(z^)≤gz¯,λ(z^′)by definition ofz^,we get:(7)gz¯,λ(z^′)>gz¯′,λ(z^′)LetJ^z¯′=argmaxλj∈J(z^j′−z¯j). First suppose that1∈J^z¯′. Thengz¯,λ(z^′)=λ1(z^1′−z¯1). Inequality (7) is then equivalent toλ1(z^1′−z¯1)>gz¯′,λ(z^′). Sincegz¯′,λ(z^′)=maxj∈Jλj(z^j′−z¯′j)≥λ1(z^1′−z¯′1)we haveλ1(z^1′−z¯1)>λ1(z^1′−z¯′1),which impliesz¯1<z¯′1,contradictingz¯1≥z¯′1. Thus,1∉J^z¯′.Let thenk′∈J^z¯′with k′ ≠ 1. Thengz¯,λ(z^′)=λk′(z^k′′−z¯k′)=λk′(z^k′′−z¯′k′)because k′ ≠ 1. Inequality (7) is thus equivalent toλk′(z^k′′−z¯k′′)>maxj∈Jλj(z^j′−z¯j′),which is impossible by definition of the max  operator.To conclude, each case is either impossible or leads toz^1′≤z^1.(b) Considering (a) and inverting the role ofz¯andz¯′,we havez^1≤z^1′. But, sincez^′is a non-dominated point by Proposition 3, there existsj∈J1¯such thatz^′j≤z^j.□In our context, the reference pointz¯evolves along the line joiningzS1tozS1¯. Proposition 5, specialized to this case, gives rise to the following result.Corollary 6Let τ, τ′ ∈ [0, 1],zS1=(m1,M2,M3,…,Mp),zS1¯=(M1,m2,m3,…,mp),z¯(τ)=τ×zS1+(1−τ)zS1¯andz¯(τ′)=τ′×zS1+(1−τ′)zS1¯. And let λ such thatλj=1Mj−mj,j=1,…,p.Letz^andz^′be two solutions of (P) using respectivelyhz¯(τ),λandhz¯(τ′),λas aggregation functions.(a)if τ′ ≥ τ, thenz^′1≤z^1.if τ′ ≤ τ then there existsj∈J1¯such thatz^′j≤z^j.Letz˜=(2m1−M1,m2,…,mp),z¯=τ×z˜+(1−τ)zS1¯andz¯′=τ′×z˜+(1−τ′)zS1¯.Pointz^,which is an optimal solution forhz¯(τ),λ,is also an optimal solution forhz¯,λ. Indeed,z¯(τ)−z¯=τ×(zS1−z˜)=τ×(M1−m1,…,Mp−mp),soz¯(τ)=z¯−τ×(M1−m1,…,Mp−mp),i.e.z¯(τ)=z¯+τ×(1λ1,…,1λp). Then, for any z ∈ Z, we havehz¯,λ(z)=hz¯(τ),λ(z)−τ(1+ρ1+(p−1)ρ1¯)where the termτ(1+ρ1+(p−1)ρ1¯)is a constant.Similarly, pointz^′,which is an optimal solution forhz¯(τ′),λ,can be proved to be an optimal solution forhz¯′,λ.Thus, consideringz¯andz¯′,conditions for applying Proposition 5 are now satisfied. Indeed, we havezj¯=zj¯′forj∈J1¯. Moreover we havez¯1′−z¯1=(τ′−τ)×(2m1−M1)+(τ−τ′)×M1=−2(τ′−τ)(M1−m1). Then:(a)if τ′ ≥ τ we havez¯1′≤z¯1,which implies, by Proposition 5,z^′1≤z^1.if τ ≥ τ′ we havez¯1′≥z¯1,then, by Proposition 5, there existsj∈J1¯such thatz^′j≤z^j.□

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have presented a multi-objective optimization interactive procedure which is able to take into account the traffic situation by modifying iteratively a traffic control policy, based on an adaptive optimization system. Three objectives have been taken into account: total waiting time and the number of stops of private vehicles (WT and NS), and the total “error on requested waiting times” ERB for public transport vehicles, while current systems generally use only one criterion or a simple weighted sum of criteria.Moreover, a real-time use of the system has been presented in which the system has been compared to another multi-objective one using the same interactive procedure but whose optimization is based on semi-adaptive optimization principles. Experimental results show that our system provides better, and most of the time, dominating solutions.Several extensions could be analyzed.The presented interactive procedure considers two extreme situations to define the domain within which the reference point can move. A natural extension could be to consider more than two such extreme points. Proving consistency between the evolution of the reference point and the evolution of the returned point could also become more difficult.The system proposed in this paper has been designed in order to optimize a single junction. It would be interesting to adapt the system to a network of several junctions in order to perform a global optimization. Such an extension would probably require additional linearizations, because the expression of the queue lengths would become quadratic. Decomposing the problem between low level optimizations for the junctions, where our system could be used, and high level optimization for the network, coordinating the results of low level optimizations would be an alternative approach.Finally, another possible perspective is to consider a fourth criterion reflecting the pedestrians viewpoint. This raises, however, specific modeling issues. Superficially, each flow of pedestrians could be considered as a new section of the junction with its own antagonisms. Observe first that these antagonisms are sometimes not strict, e.g. between vehicles turning right and pedestrians. Above all, unlike vehicle flows, the evolution of pedestrian flows is more versatile. In particular, part of these flows can derive from one originally intended crossing to another one or to no crossing at all.
