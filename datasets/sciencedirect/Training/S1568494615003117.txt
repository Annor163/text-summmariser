@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study evaluates an appropriate business model for e-book firms in Taiwan. We apply expert questionnaires to calculate the weights, which contain five criteria, namely, business strategy (BS), finance characteristics (FC), market characteristics (MC), quality measurements of product and service (QS) and implementation (IM) (BCCSM) for the capability of developing the firms’ business. Then, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is adopted to explore the weights of indices, and the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), grey relation analysis (GRA), and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are utilized to rank the three alternatives. The results show that a single brand is the best e-book firms’ business strategy that is simultaneously integrated by content, platforms, and devices, while the top two weights of the evaluation criteria are the business strategy and market characteristics to enable firms to develop an appropriate e-book business model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The e-book is an electronic text, which can be read on portable devices such as an e-reader or tablet. In addition, the evolution of flat panel display (FPD) technology and the Internet have created a brand new e-book market in recent years. For example, Amazon promoted an e-book reader, the Kindle, in November 2007. The e-book has clearly already changed people's way of reading.This phenomenon has led manufacturers to launch more kinds of e-readers or tablets such as the Nook of Barnes & Noble, the Reader of Sony, the iPad of Apple, the flyer of HTC, etc. and makes the content of the e-book become more diversified. For instance, in addition to the early literature, many magazines, newspapers and books already have their own digital versions of the e-book. According to quarterly U.S. e-book revenue, Fig. 1shows that the revenue of e-books continued to increase from less than $20 million in Q1 of 2008 to $250 million in Q3 of 2011 [7].The medium of the written word has gradually been transferred to digital format from physical paper or books in recent years. For instance, over 6.7 million customers used Amazon's Kindle or Kindle Fire for reading e-books by Q2, 2012. In addition, the e-reader has created an incredible experience for customers. It is easy to carry, and many e-books can be downloaded into one device, making our lives more convenient. On the other hand, because of the evolution of new display technology (e.g., E Ink of Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and SONY; Qualcomm's Mirsol), customers can read e-books outdoors even in strong sunlight. Therefore, we can predict that the e-book industry will have tremendous growth in the future.As for the characteristics of Taiwan's e-book market, it has large quantities of Chinese books and magazines besides those with English content, and in Taiwan several firms are producing devices and providing digital content simultaneously. Yeh [25] points out that Taiwan's e-book industry can be divided into two parts, namely, devices and content. In terms of devices, it is composed of the e-paper, panel, and OEM firms that manufacture the e-reader, and firms’ e-reader brands. For instance, firms producing the e-paper include E Ink Holding (E-Ink), Delta, and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Both E Ink and AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) produce the panels. The OEM firms producing the e-readers are Inventec Appliances Corp. (IAC), Qisda, and Foxconn. As for the firms’ e-reader brands, these include Acer, HTC and Asus. In addition, the content is composed of content providers, e-book production, and e-book platforms. For instance, the content providers are Cite Media (Cite), Yuan-Liou Publishing (YLib), and Linking Publishing (Linking). The e-book production firms include YLib, Airiti Incorporation (Airiti), and Linking. Furthermore, the e-book platform firms are eBook Taiwan, Udn.com (udn), Cite, Hami, and Hyweb Technology (Hyweb). Thus, we can discover that the e-book supply chain in Taiwan is quite complete. It is our intention in this study to investigate or explore a widely suggested business model for firms in Taiwan's e-book industry, by identifying appropriate evaluation criteria.There is so far no complete set of evaluation models of the e-book market for the reference of the e-book firms in their operations even though the e-book has rapidly been popularized. In this study, we consider a couple of criteria to assess the e-book, namely, quantitative indicators (i.e. profit, cost, and operation & maintenance fee) and qualitative indicators (i.e. positive image, firm experience, and competitive advantage). As a decision method, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) or fuzzy AHP decomposes a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem into a hierarchy [20,3]. Therefore, this study addresses the concept of business strategy (BS), finance characteristic (FC), market characteristic (MC), quality measurements of product and service (QS), and implementation (IM) (BCCSM) to construct an alternative to the business model for e-book as well as selection models for e-book firms under fuzzy AHP hierarchical forms.In the literature, there are few MCDM theories aimed at evaluating the strategy of e-book business model. This study provides the following three MCDM methods, namely, FAHP-VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno (FAHP-VIKOR), FAHP-technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FAHP-TOPSIS), and FAHP-grey relational analysis (FAHP-GRA) for constructing the e-book business strategy evaluation model. Based on the five perspectives of the BCCSM research framework, FAHP is first used to obtain the weights of the indexes. Then, the three MCDM analytical tools, VIKOR, TOPSIS, and GRA, are respectively used to evaluate and select the business model rankings based on the weight of each index. The empirical results reveal that the Model 1 has the highest value and that the Model 2 follows among the three business models in all three MCDM models.The remainder of this study is organized as follows. The hybrid fuzzy MCDM model is introduced in Section 2. The empirical application and discussions are presented in Section 3. The final section concludes.This section discusses three hybrid fuzzy MCDM models with FAHP-VIKOR, FAHP-GRA, and FAHP-TOPSIS, while FAHP is used for determining the criteria weights in the VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS process. As shown in Fig. 2, throughout the analytical structure, we employ an FAHP approach to calculate the relative weights of the evaluation indices while VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS are used for ranking the e-book business model selection.11The VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS are the three methods that are easy to apply in ranking alternatives in a MCDM environment. The VIKOR and TOPSIS methods are different in terms of the calculation procedures in normalization, aggregation steps, and ranking operation [24]. The feature of the GRA approach is that both qualitative and quantitative relationships can be identified among complex factors in a system, when the approach can examine the extent of the connections between two alternatives by using a distance measurement [12].The concepts of the fuzzy MCDM and details of the analytical methods are explained in the following subsections.Fuzzy set theory was introduced by Zadeh [26]. As an important concept applied in the scientific environment, it has been made available to other fields as well [22]. Fuzzy set theory is an important method used to measure the ambiguity of concepts that are associated with human beings’ subjective judgments including linguistic terms,22A linguistic variable is a variable whose values are not numbers but phrases in a natural language. For example, lingual expressions, such as satisfied, fair, and dissatisfied, are usually regarded as natural representations of humans’ preferences or judgments [28,10,18].degree of satisfaction and degree of importance that are often vague [18]. AHP is one of the well-known MCDM techniques [17]. Although classical AHP includes the opinions of experts and involves a multiple criteria evaluation, it is not capable of reflecting the vague thoughts of humans. Therefore, FAHP should be more appropriate and effective than conventional AHP in actual practice where an uncertain pairwise comparison environment exists [9].There are many FAHP methods proposed by various authors [21,1,2,6,14,15]. In this study, we prefer Chang's [2] extent analysis method (EAM) because the steps of this approach can be more easily applied than the other FAHP approaches. LetX=x1,x2,…,xnbe an object set, andU=u1,u2…,umbe a goal set. Each object is taken and extent analysis for each goal is performed, respectively. Therefore, m extent analysis values for each object can be obtained, with the following signs:Mgi1,Mgi2,…Mgim,i=1,2,…,n,where all theMgijj=1,2,…,mare triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs).The steps for Chang's [2] extent analysis can be given as follows [9,18].Step 1The value of the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the ith object is defined asTo obtain∑j=imMgijperform the fuzzy addition operation of m extent analysis values for a particular matrix such that∑j=1mMgij=∑j=1mlj,∑j=1mmj,∑j=1muj,Step 2AsM˜2andM˜1are two TFNs, the degree of possibility ofM˜2=(l2,m2,u2)≥M˜1(l1,m1,u1)is defined asTo compareM˜2andM˜1, we need both values ofV(M˜1≥M˜2)andV(M˜2≥M˜1).Step 3The degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be greater than k convex fuzzy numbersM˜i(i=1,2,…,k)can be defined byAssume that d′(Ai)=minV(Si≥Sk). For k=1, 2, …, n;k≠i. Then the weight vector is given byW′=(d′*(A1),d′(A2),…,d′(An))T,where Ai(i=1, 2, …, n) comprises n elements.Step 4Via normalization, the normalized weight vectors are W=(d(A1), d(A2), …, d(An))T, where W is a non-fuzzy number.This subsection introduces three MCDM techniques, namely, VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS. The three MCDM analytical tools of VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS are for ranking the e-book business model, while we use FAHP to determine the relative weights of the main and sub-criteria. The details of the three methods are explained as follows.(I)The VIKOR methodThe VIKOR method was proposed by Opricovic and Tzeng [16]. The basic concept of the VIKOR method is based on the compromise programming utilized in MCDM by comparing the measure of “closeness” to the “ideal” alternative. [16]. The various alternatives are denoted by a1, a2…, am. For an alternative ai, the merit of the jth aspect is denoted by fij, that is, fijis the value of the jth criterion function for the alternative ai.The compromise ranking algorithm is summarized as follows [16,22,12]:Step 1Determine the bestfj*and the worstfj−values of all criterion functions. Assume that the jth criterion function represents a benefit:Compute the values Siand Ri, i=1, 2, 3…, m, by the relationsCompute the values Qifor i=1, 2, 3, …, m, which are defined asGrey relational analysis (GRA)GRA is a quantitative tool used to explore the similarities and dissimilarities among factors in developing dynamic processes [5] and has been widely applied to various fields including performance evaluation [23], stock investments [27], and service quality [12]. One of the features of GRA is that both qualitative and quantitative relationships can be identified among complex factors with insufficient information (relative to conventional statistical methods). Under such conditions, the results generated by conventional statistical techniques may not be acceptable without sufficient data to achieve the desired confidence levels. By contrast, grey system theory can be used to identify major correlations among factors of a system with a relatively small amount of data. The procedure for performing GRA is as follows:Step 1Calculate the Grey Relation GradeLet X0 be the referential series with k entities (or criteria) of X1, X2, …, Xi, …, XN(or N measurement criteria). ThenXi={xi(1),xi(2),…,xi(j),…,xi(k)},i=1,…,N.The grey relational coefficient between the compared series Xiand the referential series of X0 at the j-th entity is defined as:γ0i(j)=Δmin+ΔmaxΔ0i(j)+Δmax, where Δ0i(j) is the absolute value of the difference between X0 and Xiat the j-th entity, that isΔ0i(j)=x0(j)−xi(j), andΔmax=maximaxjΔ0i(j),Δmin=miniminjΔ0i(j). The grey relational grade (GRG) for a series of Xiis given as:Γ0i=∑j=1Kwjγ0i(j), where wjis the weight of the j-th entity. If it is not necessary to apply the weight, take ωj=(1/K) as an average.Step 2Data Normalization (or Data Dimensionless)Before calculating the grey relation coefficients, the data series can be treated, based on the following three kinds of situation and the linearity of data normalization, to avoid distorting the normalized data. These are:(a)Upper-bound effectiveness measuring (i.e., the larger the better)(7)xi*(j)=xi(j)−minjxi(j)maxjxi(j)−minjxi(j).Lower-bound effectiveness measuring (i.e., the smaller the better)(8)xi*(j)=maxjxi(j)−xi(j)maxjxi(j)−minjxi(j).Moderate effectiveness measuring (i.e., nominal the best)ifminjxi(j)≤xob(j)≤maxjxi(j),thenxi*(j)=xi(j)−xob(j)maxjxi(j)−minjxi(j),where xob(j) is the objective value of entity j.The TOPSIS methodThe TOPSIS method [11] simultaneously considers the distances between a positive ideal solution (PIS) and a negative ideal solution (NIS).In this study, the final ranking of tablet PCs using the TOPSIS method is based on ‘the relative similarity to the ideal solution’, which avoids similarities between ideal and negative ideal solutions. The TOPSIS steps are as follows:(a)Establish a decision (D) matrix for alternative performance.(9)D=A1A2⋮Ai⋮AmX11X12⋯⋯X1jX1nX21X22⋯⋯X2jX2n⋮⋮⋯⋮⋮⋮Xi1Xi2⋮⋮XijXin⋮⋮⋯⋮⋮⋮Xm1Xm2⋯⋯XmjXmn.,where Aidenotes the possible alternatives, i=1, …, m; Xjrepresents attributes or criteria related to alternative performance, j=1, …, n; and Xijis a crisp value denoting the performance rating of each alternative Aiwith respect to each criterion Xj.Normalize the D matrix.Calculate the normalized decision matrix R (R=rij). The normalized value rijis calculated as follows:rij=Xij∑j=1nXij2,j=1,…,n;i=1,…,m.Create the weighted normalized performance matrix.A set of weights w=(w1, w2, … wn),∑j=1nwj=1, from the FAHP is the accommodated weight. This matrix can be calculated by multiplying each column of R by its associated weight wj. Therefore, the weighted normalized decision matrix is denoted by V:V=V11V12⋯V1j⋯V1n⋮⋮⋮⋮Vi1Vi2⋯Vij⋯Vin⋮⋮⋮⋮Vm1Vm2⋯Vmj⋯Vmn=w1r11w2r12⋯wjrij⋯wnr1n⋮⋮⋮⋮w1ri1w2ri2⋯wjrij⋯wnrin⋮⋮⋮⋮w1rm1w2rm2⋯wjrmj⋯wnrmn.Determine the ideal solution and negative ideal solution.The ideal solution is computed using the following equations:A∗={(maxVij|j∈J),(minVij|j∈J′),i=1,2,…,m},A−={(minVij|j∈J),(maxVij|j∈J′),i=1,2,…,m},where j={j=1, 2, …, n|j belongs to benefit criteria}, j′={j=1, 2, …, n|j belongs to cost criteria}.Calculate the distance between the ideal solution and the negative ideal solution for each alternative as follows:(10)Si∗=∑j=1n(Vij−Vj∗)2i=1,2,…,m,(11)Si−=∑j=1n(Vij−Vj−)2i=1,2,…,m.Calculate the relative closeness to the ideal solution for each alternative:(12)Ci*=Si−Si*+Si−i=1,2,…,m,where0≤Ci∗≤1; that is, an alternative i is closer to A* asCi∗approaches 1.A set of alternatives can be preference-ranked according to the descending order ofCi∗.The evaluation criteria used in this study are based on Lee et al. [13] who integrated previous research into their framework. In order to acquire more comprehensive assessments, we add more important criteria related to quality measurement into the framework. Consequently, we combine the required technology, innovation opportunity, and the capability to develop with implementation criteria. This study uses the five perspectives, namely, the business strategy (BS), finance characteristic (FC), market characteristic (MC), quality measurements of product and service (QS), and implementation (IM) (BCCSM), as the framework for establishing e-book business model evaluation indices while FAHP is introduced within this framework to obtain the weights of the indices. In addition, we utilize MCDM analytical tools (VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS) to evaluate the e-book business model ranking based on the weights of each index [29]. The hierarchical framework of the five perspectives evaluation criteria and the resulting discussions are illustrated as follows.Based on the five principles of evaluation (BCCSM), experts’ questionnaires were introduced to screen the indices’ fit for the e-book business model's selection and evaluation. Twenty-three evaluation indices were selected by a committee of experts, comprising 15 professional experts from e-book related industries.33We invited experts who work in Taiwan's e-book industry to complete the FAHP questionnaire. A total of eight firms participated in the investigation, including CHT, Cite, udn, CommonWealth Magazine (CWM), the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance (TABF), ASIAWORLD Digital Technology Co. (ASIAWORLD), Hyweb Technology Co. (Hyweb), and Sanlih E-Television (SET).All of them were senior managers in their firms. Therefore, they can consider the various issues, and then evaluate which alternative is the best based on their practical experience. Since important weights for both types of experts are considered equal, to avoid biases occurring, all experts utilized on this study have e-book industry-related experience. The descriptions of the criteria for the selection evaluation of the e-book business model are listed in Table A1. According to Chiang [4], the e-book business model should combine content with the corresponding devices or hardware. The e-reader is a one-time consumption product so that the sales of the subsequent e-book content are the main source of profit for the enterprise. Therefore, this study establishes three models for the hybrid fuzzy MCDM model's alternatives, which focus on the selection of a good e-book business model that combines the perspectives of content, platforms, and devices.The hierarchical framework of the five evaluation criteria (i.e., five dimensions and 23 indices) for the e-book business model is shown in Fig. 4. The five dimensions are ‘B.S.: Business Strategy (BS1–BS4)’, ‘F.C.: Finance Characteristic (FC1–FC4)’, ‘M.C.: Market Characteristic (MC1–MC4)’, ‘Q.S.: Quality Measurements of Product and Service (QS1–QS5)’, and ‘I.M.: Implementation (IM1–IM6). Table A2 provides a brief description of these three alternatives among e-book business models and arranges for the related firms for each model to be templates (thereby helping the reader to understand these alternatives in the context of famous firms).In FAHP, firstly, the importance weights of the main criteria and sub-criteria must be compared. For this reason, there must be linguistic terms and their equivalent fuzzy numbers denoting comparison measures. The linguistic comparison terms and their equivalent fuzzy numbers considered in this study are shown in Table 1.The weights of the criteria and sub-criteria are determined by FAHP. The pairwise comparison scores were obtained by 15 experts working in e-book-related industries. The fuzzy pairwise comparisons matrix for the goal is presented in Table 2.The values of fuzzy synthetic extents with respect to the goal were computed using Equation (1) as follows:SBS=(4.877,5.803,6.902)⊗(1/31.003,1/25.763,1/21.557)=(0.157,0.225,0.320)SFC=(3.403,3.963,4.750)⊗(1/31.003,1/25.763,1/21.557)=(0.110,0.154,0.220)SMC=(4.817,5.705,6.899)⊗(1/31.003,1/25.763,1/21.557)=(0.155,0.221,0.320)SQS=(4.018,4.935,6.043)⊗(1/31.003,1/25.763,1/21.557)=(0.130,0.192,0.280)SIM=(4.443,5.356,6.408)⊗(1/31.003,1/25.763,1/21.557)=(0.143,0.208,0.297)Then, the degrees of possibility are calculated by using Eq. (2) as follows:V(SBS≥SFC)=1.000,V(SBS≥SMC)=1.000,V(SBS≥SQS)=1.000,V(SBS≥SIM)=1.000.VSFC≥SBS=0.469,V(SFC≥SMC)=0.490,V(SFC≥SQS)=0.707,V(SFC≥SIM)=0.588.VSMC≥SBS=0.977,V(SMC≥SFC)=1.000,V(SMC≥SQS)=1.000,V(SMC≥SIM)=1.000.VSQS≥SBS=0.785,V(SQS≥SFC)=1.000,V(SQS≥SMC)=0.807,V(SQS≥SIM)=0.893.VSIM≥SBS=0.890,V(SIM≥SFC)=1.000,V(SIM≥SMC)=0.913,V(SIM≥SQS)=1.000.For each pairwise comparison, the minimum of the degrees of possibility is found as follows:d′(SBS)=minV(SBS≥SFC,SMC,SQS,SIM)=1.000d′(SFC)=minV(SFC≥SBS,SMC,SQS,SIM)=0.469d′(SMC)=minV(SMC≥SBS,SFC,SQS,SIM)=0977d′(SQS)=minV(SQS≥SBS,SFC,SMC,SIM)=0.785d′(SIM)=minV(SIM≥SBS,SFC,SMC,SQS)=0.890The weights vector isW′goal=(1.000,0.469,0.977,0.785,0.890)T. After the normalization, the normalized weight vector with respect to the goal is Wgoal=(0.243, 0.114, 0.237, 0.190, 0.216)T. In a similar way, the normalized weight vector of the sub-criteria with respect to the strategy (B.S.), finance characteristic (F.C.), market characteristic (M.C.), quality measurements of product and service (Q.S.), and implementation (I.M.) are calculated as follows:WBS=(d(BS1),d(BS2),d(BS3),d(BS4))=(0.552,0.165,0.237,0.046)TWFC=(d(FC1),d(FC2),d(FC3),d(FC4))T=(0.316,0.194,0.169,0.321)WMC=(d(MC1),d(MC2),d(MC3),d(MC4))T=(0.266,0.295,0.325,0.114)WQS=(d(QS1),d(QS2),d(QS3),d(QS4),d(QS5))T=(0.191,0.455,0.229,0.010,0.115)WIM=(d(IM1),d(IM2),d(IM3),d(IM4),d(IM5),d(IM6))T=(0.258,0.186,0.252,0.207,0.013,0.085)Furthermore, following the fuzzy pairwise comparisons matrix for the alternatives, the weights of importance of alternatives with sub-criteria should be calculated respectively as shown in Table A4. The relative importance scores for each evaluation index analyzed by the FAHP are listed in Table 3.The results show that the critical order of the five dimensions for the evaluation of the e-book business model is “B.S.: Business Strategy (0.243)”, “F.C.: Finance Characteristic (0.114)”, “M.C.: Market Characteristic (0.237)”, “Q.S.: Quality Measurements of Product and Service (0.190)”, and “I.M.: Implementation (0.216)”. Table 3 presents the respective weights of the four indexes for the “Business Strategy perspective, BS1 (0.552), BS2 (0.165), BS3 (0.237), and B4 (0.046)”. The respective weights of the four indexes for the “Finance Characteristic perspective are FC1 (0.316), FC2 (0.194), FC3 (0.169), and FC4 (0.321)”. The respective weights of the four indexes for the “Market Characteristic perspective are MC1 (0.266), MC2 (0.295), MC3 (0.325), and MC4 (0.114)”. The respective weights of the five indexes for the “Quality Measurements of Product and Service perspective are QS1 (0.191), QS2 (0.455), QS3 (0.229), QS4 (0.010), and QS5 (0.115)”. The respective weights of the six indexes for the “Implementation perspective are IM1 (0.258), IM2 (0.186), IM3 (0.252), IM4 (0.207), IM5 (0.013), and IM6 (0.085)”.The following are the synthesis values (overall weights) of the three e-book business models under twenty-three indexes: BS1 (0.134), BS2 (0.040), BS3 (0.058), BS4 (0.011), FC1 (0.036), FC2 (0.022), FC3 (0.019), FC4 (0.037), MC1 (0.063), MC2 (0.070), MC3 (0.077), MC4 (0.027), QS1 (0.036), QS2 (0.086), QS3 (0.044), QS4 (0.002), QS5 (0.022), IM1 (0.056), IM2 (0.040), IM3 (0.054), IM4 (0.045), IM5 (0.003), and IM6 (0.018). As indicated in Table 3, the eight most important evaluation indexes are “BS1: Firm strategy (0.134)”, “QS2: User-friendliness (0.086)”, “MC3: Competitive advantage (0.077)”, “MC2: Potential growth of the market (0.070)”, “MC1: Market size (0.063)”, “BS3: Firm experience (0.058)”, “IM1: Required technology (0.056)”, and “IM3: Capability of development (0.054)”.In this section, the VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS methods are introduced to rank the alternative performances. The priority weights of alternative performance with respect to the sub-criteria calculated by FAHP are shown in Table A3.The FAHP-VIKOR approach ranks the performance of the three e-book business models based on the weights of the five main performance evaluation indexes by FAHP as shown in Table A3. Table A4 shows the performance matrix given by Eq. (3) with the best valuefj*and the worst valuefj−. The values of Siand Riby Eqs. (4) and (5) are shown in Table A5, while the computed value Qi(with v=0, 0.5, 1) using Eq. (6) and the preference order e-book business model ranking are given in Table 4. The performance ranking order of the three e-book business models by VIKOR (which postulates that v=0.5) is Model 1 (Qi=0.000) Qi=0.000>Model 2 (Qi=0.787)>Model 3 (Qi=1.000).The weights are estimated by 15 experts with each of the respondents using Saaty's relative importance scale and averaging their scales to assess candidates, before establishing a decision making matrix as shown in Table A3.The twenty-three sub-criteria are ‘the larger the better’. Accordingly, the referential series can be X0=(0.425, 0.719, 0.613, 0.520, 0.686, 0.687, 0.560, 0.811, 0.805, 0.913, 0.655, 0.541, 0.537, 0.803, 0.875, 0.884, 0.736, 0.401, 0.444, 0.558, 0.504, 0.404, and 0.396). The e-book business models are X1, X2, and X3. The candidates are X1, X2, and X3. Data are normalized for twenty-three sub-criteria by using Eqs. (7) and (8). Following the normalization of the data and the relational coefficients of the compared series, Table 5reveals the result that Model 1 is the top one and is followed by Model 2 and Model 3.Based on the FAHP-TOPSIS method, by using the decision, normalized, and weighted normalized decision matrices, Equations (10) and (11) determine the ideal solution and negative ideal solution (Table 6). Following the TOPSIS weights and the relative closeness to the ideal solution of each alternative,Ci*, from Equation (12), we have the performance ranking order of the three e-book business models as follows: Model 1 (0.996)>Model 2 (0.252)>Model 3 (0.111).The final values and preference order ranking for these three hybrid fuzzy MCDM models, namely, FAHP-VIKOR, FAHP-GRA, and FAHP-TOPSIS, are summarized in Table 7.This study conducted a performance analysis for the e-book business model using a hybrid fuzzy MCDM approach based on the five main perspectives. Three hybrid fuzzy MCDM models (i.e., FAHP-VIKOR, FAHP-GRA, and FAHP-TOPSIS) were employed in the performance analysis to compute the weights of the criteria, ranking the e-book business model's performance and attempting to explain the differences among the three e-book business models, respectively.As shown in Table 3, the results of the FAHP analysis reveal that the “business strategy” perspective (WFAHP (0.243)), “market characteristic” perspective (WFAHP (0.237)), and “implementation” perspective (WFAHP (0.216)) have higher weightings. These findings indicate that firms will first consider the perspective of the market and further evaluate whether the current market has enough size and niches for the development of the e-book business model. From a long-term perspective, firms may have to consider whether they can continually earn a profit in the market in the future. On the other hand, firms do not want to invest the resources for their business if the market does not have enough niches. They have a responsibility to their business to make more profit for the shareholders. The second important concern of firms is their strategies. The right business strategies can help firms to enjoy more competitive advantages and reduce uncertainty in their business. For example, Apple always utilizes its Apple store applications to attract more customers to buy hardware such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone and Mac Air NB.Based on the empirical results, we find that Model 1 has the highest value among the three e-book business models for the three hybrid fuzzy MCDM models (i.e., FAHP-VIKOR (Qi=0.000), FAHP-GRA (0.987), and FAHP-TOPSIS (0.996)); Model 2 has the second highest value (i.e., FAHP-VIKOR (Qi=0.787), FAHP-GRA (0.466), and FAHP-TOPSIS (0.252)); and Model 3 comes last with the lowest weight (i.e., FAHP-VIKOR (Qi=1.000), FAHP-GRA (0.357), and FAHP-TOPSIS (0.111)). Consequently, Model 1 can be regarded as a reference template for firms developing the e-book business model.Amazon's success in recent years can be a representative example for Model 1. We can find that Amazon has integrated many fields in its business. For instance, in terms of reading services, Amazon not only has various types of e-book content to meet customers’ needs, but it also has user-friendly platforms to deliver them. In terms of reading devices, Amazon has launched both an e-reader and Tablet PC with the lowest prices in the market, which are the Kindle ($79) and Kindle Fire ($199), respectively. In other words, this shows that customers can spend less money on the devices, so that they can conveniently read in any place and quickly acquire e-books. Fig. 5shows that Amazon increased its market share in the Android tablet market from 3% to 36% after launching Kindle Fire. In addition, in terms of cloud services, Amazon provides 5GB of free storage space to customers for storing e-books, so that customers are more likely to download more e-books. In terms of videos and applications, Amazon offers a large number of songs, movies and TV shows, and applications, which can meet customers’ multimedia needs. Thus, we can know that Amazon offers the most appropriate business model to customers.Furthermore, Table 8indicates that Android has increased its market share of operating systems from 29% to 39% in 2011. On the other hand, the Kindle Fire was loved by its customers when Amazon launched it. The majority of experts believe that Amazon's Kindle Fire has contributed the most to the increase in Android's market share. To sum up, Amazon's success displays the benefits of Model 1, which has combined the perspective of content, platforms, and devices. Furthermore, it can be learned that firms may obtain more benefits if they have various e-books, platforms that are user-friendly, and devices that are lower in price. Hence, Model 1 can be a representative template for firms in Taiwan's e-book industry.This study adopts the fuzzy MCDM point of view to construct the selection of an e-book business model based on the conceptual framework of this research. The chief advantage of this study is that it can be used for both qualitative and quantitative indices [23]. Systematic approaches using FAHP, VIKOR, GRA, and TOPSIS have been applied for selecting and evaluating the best e-book business model. The major finding is that Model 1 is the best alternative with the highest rating regardless of whether we use VIKOR, GRA or TOPSIS to double check the rankings.Because there is much Chinese book content in the Taiwan market, firms have more opportunities to develop diversified e-book content. Besides, the manufacturing technology of the devices is quite mature so that firms in Taiwan have enough capabilities to develop their own brands of e-reader. Consequently, the firms in Taiwan are quite suitable for the development of Model 1. Thus, this study suggests two viewpoints. First, we suggest that firms can use Model 1 to develop their business. Second, we suggest that firms need to have various e-books, friendly platforms for users, and devices that are lower in price. Thus, firms may have more chances to make more profits.Consequently, the results of this study provide a complete analysis of e-book business model selection. We hope that the study will clarify several issues or clear the way for new research topics, which will help to integrate the studies on the e-book industry. Although we apply a couple of methods to explore our theme, we believe that these methods have some limitations. For instance, decision problems could be very complicated today, so that decision makers’ opinions may be easy to scale. In future research, the decision making trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with the fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) and the VIKOR method could be effectively used to solve the complex and tangled problem of understanding the complex structure of the causal relationships and that it should be given more consideration in further studies.See Tables A1–A5.
