@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present numerical approximations of optimal portfolios in mispriced Lévy markets under asymmetric information for informed and uninformed investors having logarithmic preference. We apply our numerical scheme to Kou (2002) jump-diffusion markets by deriving analytic formulas for the first two derivatives of the underlying portfolio objective function which depend only on the Lévy measure of the jump-generating process. Optimal portfolios are then simulated using the Box–Muller algorithm, Newton’s method and incomplete Beta functions. Convergence dynamics and trajectories of sample paths of optimal portfolios for both investors are presented at different levels of information asymmetry, mispricing, horizon, asymmetry in the Kou density, jump intensity, volatility, mean-reversion speed, and Sharpe ratios. We also apply the proposed Newton’s algorithm to compute optimal portfolios for investors in Variance Gamma markets via instantaneous centralized moments of returns.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Asymmetric information models assume that there are two types of investors in the market—informed and uninformed. The informed investor trades because he or she has non-public informational advantage, while the uninformed is a liquidity trader or hedger without an information advantage. The informed investor partially reveals information to the uninformed investor through trades. Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) and Easley and O’Hara (2004) provide evidence of the importance of information asymmetry in asset pricing. They find that prices and demand for the risky asset by uninformed investors fall as information asymmetry increases. Their results confirm that information asymmetry is priced, and imply that liquidity is a primary channel that links asymmetry to prices.Mispricing11See related studies by Brunnermeier (2001), Buckley, Brown, and Marshall (2012), Buckley, Long, and Perera (2014), Buckley, Long, and Perera (2015), Buckley and Long (2015), Guasoni (2006), Shiller (1981), Summers (1986) and Wang (1993).is the difference between the asset price and its fundamental value. It is modeled by a mean-reverting Orstein–Uhlenbeck process. Because of the exponential decay associated with mean-reverting processes, it has an associated half-life which is inversely proportional to its mean-reversion rate. Half-life is a measure of the slowness of a mean-reverting process, and is measured in trading days. It may be defined as the average time it takes the mean-reverting process to get pulled half-way back to its long-term mean. In this context, half-life gives an estimate of how long we should expect the mispricing to remain far from zero. Thus, a half-life of 10 days means that it takes 20 trading days on average for the mispricing to revert to zero. We define mean-reversion time as the inverse of the mean-reversion rate, and use it as an equivalent measure of mispricing. In other words, mean-reversion speed or mean-reversion time is a proxy for mispricing. In this paper, we combine the concepts of asymmetric information, mispricing, and mean-reversion, and apply them to the Kou (2002) jump-diffusion and Variance Gamma (VG) markets to study the impact on the optimal demand for the risky asset by investors having logarithmic preference.Portfolio allocation problems22See Aït-Sahalia, Cacho-Diaz, and Hurd (2009), Bae, Kim, and Mulvey (2014), Buckley et al. (2012), Buckley et al. (2014), Buckley et al. (2015), Canakoglu and Ozekici (2010), Celikyurt and Ozekici (2007), Corazza and Favaretto (2007), Cvitanic, Polimenis, and Zapatero (2008), Fu, Lari-Lavassani, and Li (2010), Fu, Wei, and Yang (2014), Huang, Zhu, Fabozzi, and Fukushima (2010), Kellerer, Mansini, and Speranza (2000), Kraft and Steffensen (2013), Lin and Liu (2008), Mansini and Speranza (1999), Soyer and Tanyeri (2006), Yu, Takahashi, Inoue, and Wang (2010) and Wang and Forsyth (2011).have been extensively studied in various settings since the seminal work of Markowitz (1952). Recently, Buckley et al. (2014) show that optimal portfolios satisfy some nonlinear stochastic equations for both informed and uninformed investors in the asymmetric and mispriced Lévy markets. Usually there are no analytic solutions to these nonlinear equations. Numerical and analytic approximations are therefore critical for portfolio allocation problems. We solve our problem by presenting a simple but highly efficient approximation to our asset allocation problem in the asymmetric and mispriced Kou and VG market setting. In particular, we apply the theory presented in the recent studies by Buckley et al. (2012), Buckley et al. (2014) and Buckley et al. (2015) to compute numerical approximations of the optimal portfolios with the aid of Newton’s method, the Box–Muller algorithm, and the incomplete Beta functions.Kou (2002) jump-diffusion model deals with a finite activity process in the sense that only a small number of jumps occur per unit of time. Empirical tests in Ramenzani and Zeng (2007) demonstrate that Kou’s double exponential jump-diffusion model fits stock data better than Merton’s normal jump-diffusion model. It is also very tractable, and therefore, is a natural candidate to apply our general numerical scheme. For the Kou markets, we derive analytic formulas for the first two derivatives of the underlying portfolio objective function presented in Buckley et al. (2014) which depends only on the Lévy measure of the process generating the jumps. Using the parameters in Kou (2002) and Ramenzani and Zeng (2007), we then implement our model by simulating paths of optimal portfolios for each investor at various levels of mispricing, information asymmetry, investment horizon, volatility, Sharpe ratio, jump probability, and jump size.The Variance Gamma (VG) model introduced by Madan and Seneta (1990) and Madan, Carr, and Chang (1998) has found extensive applications in modeling stock returns, option pricing and structural credit risk models. It is of infinite activity, that is, there are infinitely many arrivals of small jumps per unit of time. We also employ our theory to the Variance Gamma (VG) Lévy markets to examine how asset mispricing and information asymmetry affect the optimal portfolio and maximum expected utilities of investors in this market. Cvitanic et al. (2008) report that jumps in asset prices lead to higher moments that must be captured when modeling returns and allocating portfolios. Following Cvitanic et al. (2008) and Buckley et al. (2014), we employ instantaneous centralized moments of returns (ICMR) in our analysis of the VG markets and then combine Newton’s method with the ICMR to produce numerical approximations of the optimal portfolios of the investors at different levels of mispricing, asymmetric information, jump intensity, volatility, and horizon.To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to report on the impact of mispricing and asymmetric information in the Kou (2002) and Variance Gamma markets, and therefore, contributes to the literature on mispricing and asymmetric information asset pricing models.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the model is briefly reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, Newton’s method is proposed to give numerical computation of optimal portfolios in the asymmetric Lévy markets. The Kou jump-diffusion market is introduced in Section 4. Newton’s algorithm depends on the first two derivatives of a non-trivial objective function G(.), which is a moment generating function. In this section, we also develop analytic formulas for said derivatives in terms of the cumulative distribution functions of incomplete Beta random variables. The mispriced VG market is introduced in Section 5, where an explicit formula is given for the optimal portfolio. We also report details of the VG market, including ICMR and their effects on mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the return process. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Numerical results for the Kou and VG markets under various levels of asymmetric information, volatility, mean-reversion speed, Poisson arrival rates and asymmetric distributions are reported in the Appendices.In this section, we briefly review the model and the corresponding optimal portfolios in the asymmetric Lévy markets discussed in Buckley et al. (2014). The economy consists of two assets; a risk-free asset B, called bank account or money market, with price(2.1)Bt=exp(∫0trsds),and a risky asset S, called stock. The bank account earns a continuously compounded risk-free interest rate rt, while the continuous component of the stock’s total percentage appreciation rate or expected return is μt, at time t ∈ [0, T], where T is the investment horizon. The stock is subject to continuous volatility σt> 0. The market parameters are μt, rt, σt, t ∈ [0, T], and are assumed to be deterministic functions. The stock has log return dynamics:(2.2)d(logSt)=(μt−12σt2)dt+σtdYt+dXt,t∈[0,T],(2.3)Yt=pWt+qUt,p2+q2=1,p≥0,q≥0,(2.4)dUt=−λUtdt+dBt,λ>0,U0=0,(2.5)Xt=∫0t∫RxN(ds,dx),where X is a pure jump Lévy process having a sigma-finite Lévy measure v onB(R−{0}),with triple (γ, 0, v), whereγ=∫|x|<1xv(dx). W and B are independent standard Brownian motions independent of X. N is a Poisson random measure onR+×B(R−{0})that is linked to the stock. It counts the jumps of X in the time interval (0, t). The return of the stock has three components; a continuous componentμt*=μt−12σt2; a diffusive component σtdYtwhich is random, and a discontinuous component dXt, which is also random. The continuous component of the stock’s returnμt*and the volatility σt, are assumed to be deterministic functions withσ=limt→∞σt=σ∞>0.We take σtto be a constant. The processY=(Yt)t≥0,is the continuous random component of excess return, and the mean–reverting O–U processUt=∫0te−λ(t−s)dBsrepresents the mispricing/fads.U=(Ut)is a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with mean-reversion rate λ. Because of the exponential decay associated with a mean-reverting process, its half-life isH=ln2λ. Note that we can use half-life H, mean-reversion rate λ and the mean-reversion timeτ=1/λas equivalent measures of mispricing. Large values of the mean-reversion time  τ (equivalently, small values of λ) correspond to high levels of mispricing. Namely the mispricing process U takes a long time to revert to zero, which indicates that mispricing is persistent.Applying Itô’s formula to (2.2) yields the percentage return dynamics:(2.6)dStSt−=μtdt+σtdYt+∫R(ex−1)N(dt,dx),t∈[0,T],and its solution is given bySt=S0exp(∫0t(μs−12σs2)ds+∫0tσsdYs+Xt).We assume that there are two classes of investors, which consist of informed and uninformed investors. The informed investor, indexed byi=1,observes both the asset prices and its fundamental value (through the mispricing process U). The information flow (filtration) of the informed investor is defined byHt1=▵σ(Ws,Bs,Xs:s≤t)∨σ(N),whereN={D⊂Ω:∃A∈F,D⊂A,P(A)=0}. The uninformed investor, indexed byi=0,observes only the asset price and has no direct knowledge of the mispricing process U. Its filtration is defined byHt0=Ft0∨σ(Xu:u≤t),t∈[0,T],whereFt0=σ(Ys:s≤t),and X and Y are defined by Eqs. (2.3)–(2.5). Clearly,Ft0⊂Ht0⊂Ht1⊂F. According to Buckley et al. (2014), for i ∈ {0, 1}, under asymmetric information, the percentage return dynamics for the ith investor is(2.7)dStSt−=μtidt+σtdBti+∫R(ex−1)N(dt,dx),where B, BiareHi-adapted standard Brownian motions,μti=μt+υtiσt,andυt0=−λ∫0te−λ(t−u)(1+γ(u))dBu0,υt1=−λqUt=−λq∫0te−λ(t−u)dBu1,γ(u)=1−p21+ptanh(λpu)−1.LetVi,πi,x:[0,T]⟶Rbe the wealth process of the ith investor at time t, whenπt≡πtiis invested in the stock, with i ∈ {0, 1}. For brevity, we denote this process byVi,π=(Vti,π)or simplyVi=(Vti),when the context is clear. LetV0i=x>0be the initial wealth. Then the wealth process Visatisfies the following dynamics:(2.8)dVtiVt−i=(πtiσtθti+rt)dt+πtiσtdBti+∫Rπti(ex−1)N(dt,dx),whereθi=μi−rσis the Sharpe ratio. Hereafter, we shall consider only the discounted wealth process defined byV˜ti=Vtiexp(−∫0trsds).We seek a portfolio processπ=(πt)t≥0in an admissible setAi(x)defined byAi(x)={πi;πiisHi−predictablesuchthatV˜ti,πi>0}.π is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable sigma-algebra on [0, T] × Ω, which is the sigma-algebra of all left continuous functions with right limits on [0, T] × Ω.The optimal portfolio for the informed investor isπ*,i∈Ai(x)such thatE(logV˜Ti,π*)=maxπ∈Ai(x)ElogV˜Ti,π.That is,π*,i=argmaxπ∈Ai(x)ElogV˜Ti,π.It is shown in Buckley et al. (2014) that to maximize the logarithmic utility from terminal wealth, an investor must hold an optimal portfolio of stocks given by the following theorem.Theorem 1LetG(π)=∫Rlog(1+π(ex−1))v(dx),π ∈ [0, 1]. If∫R(e±x−1)2v(dx)<∞,then(1)G′′(π) < 0. That is, G is strictly concave on [0, 1].Let i ∈ {0, 1}. For the ith investor, there is a unique optimal portfolio π*, ifor the stock with dynamics(2.2), given by(2.9)πt*,i=θtiσt+G′(πt*,i)σt2,providedπ*,i∈[0,1]⊂Ai(x),the admissible set.The maximum expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for the ith investor, having x > 0 of initial capital, is(2.10)ui(x)=logx+12E∫0T(θti)2dt+E∫0Tfi(πti,*)dt,wherefi(πti)=−12(πtiσt−θti)2+G(πti),μti=μt+υtiσt,andθti=μti−rtσtare Sharpe ratios.When both investors have equal information, the market is symmetric withq=0and Ytreduces to a standard Brownian motion. In this case,μti=μtfor i ∈ {0, 1} and the optimal portfolioπt*satisfies(2.11)πt*=μt−rt+G′(πt*)σt2.The optimal portfolios (please see Theorem 1) are basically fixed points of the first derivative of the function G(.), which is a moment generating function (the function G(.) generates instantaneous centralized moments of returns). Each optimal portfolio is the Merton optimal (for the symmetric market) plus an excess holding of risky asset which is inversely proportional to the diffusive variance (sigma squared) and directly proportional to G′(.), the growth rate of G(.) at the risky asset proportion level. The optimal portfolios are therefore very sensitive to information asymmetry, mean reversion speed, volatility, Sharp ratio and activity of the Lévy measure. For example, as the diffusive volatility increases, the agents basically hold the deterministic Merton optimal. The excess stock holding is positive or negative in lockstep with the sign and magnitude of G′(.); that is, whether G(.) is increasing or decreasing at that stock proportion.By Remark 1 in Section 2, the exact unique optimal portfolio in a symmetric market isπt=θtσt+G′(πt)σt2=μt−rt+G′(πt)σt2,whereθt=μt−rtσtis the Sharpe ratio. This is a non-linear equation which must be solved numerically. For simplicity, we drop the superscript * in the portfolioπt*.In this section, we employ Newton’s method to achieve this objective. For each t ∈ [0, T], defineg:[0,1]⟶Rby the prescription,g(πt)=πt−θtσt−G′(πt)σt2.We generate a sequence {πt(n)} which converges to πt, via the algorithm:(3.1)πt(0)=θtσtπt(n+1)=πt(n)−g(πt(n))g′(πt(n)),n≥0.In term of the derivatives G′(α) and G′′(α), we have the equivalent algorithm:Setϵ=0.5×10−d,where d ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.(3.2)πt(0)=θtσt(3.3)πt(n+1)=−πt(n)G′′(πt(n))+θtσt+G′(πt(n))σt2−G′′(πt(n)),n≥0.(3.4)ϵt(n)=|πt(n+1)−πt(n)|Stop if ϵt(n) < ϵ, and takeπt=πt(n+1). Else, setn=n+1and repeat search.Let i ∈ {0, 1}. We use Newton’s method to estimate the optimal portfoliosπtiat each time t ∈ [0, T] (again, the superscript * is dropped). Observe from Eq. (2.9) that the formula for the optimal portfolios of investors involves Gaussian random variables such as(3.5)υt1=−λqB˜t1,andυt0=−λB˜t0,whereB˜t1=Ut=∫0te−λ(t−s)dBs∼N(0,1−e−2λt2λ),B˜t0=∫0te−λ(t−s)(1+γ(s))dBs0∼N(0,∫0te−2λ(t−s)(1+γ(s))2ds),γ(s)=q21+ptanh(λps)−1.BtandBt0are independent standard Brownian motions, andN(0,δ2)is a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance δ2. The optimal portfolio of the ith investor is(3.6)πti=θtσt+υtiσt+G′(πti)σt2.In particular, for the informed investor, it is(3.7)πt1=θtσt−λqB˜t1σt+G′(πt1)σt2,and for the uninformed investor it is(3.8)πt0=θtσt−λB˜t0σt+G′(πt0)σt2.Remark 3SinceB˜t1andB˜t0are integrated Brownian motions (Gaussian random variables) for each t ∈ [0, T], we randomly generate these values for use in Newton’s algorithm at each time t.Consider the normal random variableκ∼N(0,δ2). Thenξt=κδ∼N(0,1).Based on Eq. (2.9) in Theorem 1, we propose the following:AlgorithmLet i ∈ {0, 1}, t ∈ [0, T], andp,q∈[0,1],p2+q2=1.Step 1:    Randomly generate ui, independent uniform variables on [0, 1].Step 2:    Generate independent standard normal random variables ξ0 and ξ1 by the Box–Muller method as follows:(3.9)ξt0=−2lnu1cos(2πu0)(3.10)ξt1=−2lnu1sin(2πu0).Step 3:   The optimal portfolios for the investors are generated numerically from(3.11)πt1=θtσt−λqB˜t1σt+G′(πt1)σt2,and for the uninformed investor, it is(3.12)πt0=θtσt−λB˜t0σt+G′(πt0)σt2.Step 4: Generatevt0andvt1recursivelyvt1=−λqB˜t1,whereB˜t1=Ut=∫0te−λ(t−s)dBsis distributed∼N(0,1−e−2λt2λ). Leth=1252be the time step.Sett=kh,k=0,1,2,..N=Th,T=1,B˜1(0)=0.(3.13)B˜1(t+h)=e−λhB˜1(t)+(1−e−2λh2λ)ξt1Thus, in terms of k, wherek=0,1,2,…,N=Th,(3.14)B˜1(kh+h)=e−λhB˜1(kh)+(1−e−2λh2λ)ξk1,whereξk1are drawn from the standard normal variable N(0, 1).vt0=−λB˜t0,whereB˜0(t)=∫0te−λ(t−s)(1+γ(s))dBs0γ(s)=q21+ptanh(λps)−1.B˜0(t)is distributed∼N(0,∫0te−2λ(t−s)(1+γ(s))2ds). Sett=kh,k=0,1,2,…,N=Th,T=1,B˜0(0)=0.(3.15)B˜0(t+h)=e−λhB˜0(t)+∫tt+he−λ(t+h−s)(1+γ(s))dBs0≈e−λhB˜0(t)+e−λh(1+γ(t))hξt0=e−λhB˜0(t)+q2(e−λh1+ptanh(λpt))hξt0.Thus, in terms of k, wherek=0,1,2,…,N=Th,(3.16)B˜0(kh+h)≈e−λhB˜0(kh)+e−λh(1+γ(kh))hξk0=e−λhB˜0(kh)+q2(e−λh1+ptanh(λpkh))hξk0,whereξk0are drawn from the standard normal variable N(0, 1).Step 5: The optimal portfoliosπtiare estimated byπti(n)using Newton’s method as follows:(3.17)πti(0)=θtσt(3.18)πti(n+1)=−πti(n)G′′(πti(n))+θtiσt+G′(πti(n))σt2−G′′(πti(n)),n≥0,(3.19)ϵti(n)=|πti(n+1)−πti(n)|with Sharpe ratios(3.20)θt=μt−rtσt,(3.21)θt0=θt−λB˜t0,(3.22)θt1=θt−λqB˜t1.Stop ifϵti(n)<ϵ,and takeπti=πti(n+1). Else, setn=n+1and repeat search.Remark 4In Newton’s algorithm, the computation of the approximate optimal portfolios involves the derivativesG′(π)andG′′(π). In general, it is very difficult or impossible to derive closed-form analytic formulas for these derivatives in the general Lévy markets. However, in the next section, we show that analytic formulas exist forG′(π)andG′′(π)in the Kou jump diffusion market although it requires some non-trivial mathematical derivations. We also note that optimal portfolios bigger than 1 are truncated at 1, while portfolios less than 0 are truncated at 0.It is well-known that asset return distributions have heavier left and right tails than the normal distributions. Jump-diffusion models since the pioneering work of Merton (1976) are among the most popular alternative models proposed to address this issue, and they are especially useful to price options with short maturities. Brownian motion and normal distribution have been widely used in the Black–Scholes–Merton option-pricing framework to model the return of assets. However, two puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations: the leptokurtic feature that the return distribution of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails than those of the normal distribution, and an empirical phenomenon called “volatility smile” in option markets. Kou (2002) argues that the existing models either do not explain the observed behavior of stock prices, or are too complex to yield analytical solutions for many American options.Kou incorporates both of these properties by proposing a double exponential33See also, Cai and Kou (2011), Kou and Wang (2004), Ramenzani and Zeng (2007) and Sepp (2004).jump-diffusion model which is both tractable and applicable for option pricing. Moreover, the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions for a variety of option-pricing problems, including European call and put options, interest rate derivatives such as swaptions, caps, floors, and bond options, and path-dependent options such as perpetual American options, barrier, and lookback options.Kou (2002) assumes that the price of the underlying asset is modeled by two parts;   a continuous part driven by Brownian motion, and a jump part where the logarithm of the jump sizes have a double exponential distribution. Because of its simplicity, the parameters in the model can be easily interpreted, and the analytical solutions for option pricing can be obtained. Kou (2002) is a finite activity process in the sense that only a small number of jumps occur per unit of time. Empirical tests in Ramenzani and Zeng (2007) demonstrate that Kou’s double exponential jump-diffusion model fits stock data better than Merton’s normal jump-diffusion model. It is also very tractable, and therefore is a natural candidate market for application of the theory in Buckley et al. (2014).The mispriced Kou jump-diffusion model has stock price dynamics(4.1)dStSt−=μtdt+σtdYt+d(Σi=1N(t)(Vi−1)),where Y is given in (2.3) and (2.4), N is the driving Poisson process with intensityλ˜,and the log jump amplitudeZ=log(V)has double exponential distribution with densityf=fkou,dependent on 3 parametersp˜,η1 and η2, and given by(4.2)fkou(x)=p˜η1exp(−η1x)I{x>0}+q˜η2exp(−η2|x|)I{x<0},η1>1,η2>0,p˜+q˜=1,p˜≥0,q˜≥0.Whenq=0(without mispricing) orλ=0(without mean-reversion) in Y, this model reduces to the original model introduced by Kou (2002). Z can be expressed as:Z={Zu,withprobabilityp˜,Zd,withprobabilityq˜,whereZu∼Exp(η1),Zd∼Exp(η2),are exponential random variables with means1η1and1η2,respectively. Zu, the upward jump log–amplitude, occurs with probabilityp˜,which is not expected to exceed 100 percent. This leads to the constraint(4.3)E(Zu)=1η1<1.Zdis the log-amplitude of the downward movements in returns, which occurs with probabilityq˜=1−p˜. For this model, we have:E(Z)=p˜η1−q˜η2,raVar(Z)=p˜q˜(1η1+1η2)2+(p˜η12+q˜η22).E(V)=q˜η2(η2+1)+p˜η1(η1−1)is the expected jump amplitude. The Kou Lévy density vkouis given by:(4.4)vkou(x)=λ˜fkou(x)=λ˜p˜η1exp(−η1x)I{x>0}+λ˜q˜η2exp(−η2|x|)I{x<0}.LetG(π)=∫Rlog(1+π(ex−1))v(dx),π ∈ [0, 1], where v(dx) is the Kou Lévy measure. Then(4.5)G′(π)=∫−∞∞ex−11+π(ex−1)ν(dx);(4.6)G′′(π)=−∫−∞∞(ex−1)2(1+π(ex−1))2ν(dx).In general, if there are no analytic formulas available forG′(π)andG′′(π),we can use standard Riemann sums to approximate these integrals. In this section, we develop analytic formulas for the derivatives of G(π) in terms of the incomplete Beta functions (or equivalently, the cumulative distribution functions of Beta random variables). We show that G′(π) and G′′(π) can be expressed analytically in terms of incomplete Beta functions. Let α ∈ [0, 1] and η > 0. Define(4.7)D(α,η)=▵∫0∞ex−11+α(ex−1)e−ηxdx,and J(α, η), by the prescription:(4.8)J(α,η)=▵∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η.We introduce the standard incomplete Beta function as follows:B(a,b;x)=∫0xta−1(1−t)b−1dt,a>0,b>0,x∈[0,1].We use ⌊η⌋ to denote the integer part of a positive number η.We have the following preliminary result which will be used to establish analytic formulas forG′(π)andG′′(π)in the Kou jump-diffusion market.Proposition 1In the Kou jump-diffusion market, we have(1)J(α,η+1)=1(1−α)η−α1−αJ(α,η)for α ∈ [0, 1) and η > 0.J(α,η)=αη−1(1−α)ηB(η,1−η;1−α)for 0 < η < 1 and α ∈ [0, 1).For any η > 0 and α ∈ [0, 1),J(α,η)=11−α∑i=1⌊η⌋(−1)i−1η−i(α1−α)i−1+(−1)⌊η⌋αη−1(1−α)ηB(η−⌊η⌋,⌊η⌋+1−η;1−α).D(α,η)=11−αJ(α,η)−1η(1−α)for α ∈ [0, 1) and η > 0.(1)J(α,η+1)=∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η+1=α1−α∫0∞[1α(1+y)−1(1+αy)]dy(1+y)η=11−α∫0∞dy(1+y)η+1−α1−α∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η=1η(1−α)−α1−αJ(α,η).(2) Using the change of variable1+αy=1−αt,we findJ(α,η)=∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η=αη−1(1−α)η∫01−αtη−1(1−t)(1−η)−1dt=αη−1(1−α)ηB(η,1−η;1−α).(3) It is straightforward to use (1) and (2) recursively to getJ(α,η)=1(1−α)(η−1)−α1−αJ(α,η−1)=⋯=11−α∑i=1⌊η⌋(−1)i−1η−i(α1−α)i−1+(−1)⌊η⌋(α1−α)⌊η⌋J(α,η−⌊η⌋)=11−α∑i=1⌊η⌋(−1)i−1η−i(α1−α)i−1+(−1)⌊η⌋αη−1(1−α)ηB(η−⌊η⌋,⌊η⌋+1−η;1−α).(4) By change of variabley=ex−1and the recursive formula in part (1), we findD(α,η)=∫0∞ex−11+α(ex−1)e−ηxdx=∫0∞ydy(1+αy)(1+y)η+1=∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η−∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η+1=J(α,η)−J(α,η+1)=J(α,η)−[1(1−α)η−α1−αJ(α,η)]=11−αJ(α,η)−1η(1−α).□The incomplete Beta function (or equivalently the Beta cumulative distribution function) is readily available in many statistical packages. It can also be directly implemented in MATLAB. Consequently, J(α, η) and D(α, η) can be computed directly from the incomplete Beta function.The D(., .) function above are inputs for building the derivative of G, as the following result shows.Theorem 2For the Kou model,with parameters η1 ≥ 1, η2 > 0,λ˜>0,p˜+q˜=1,p˜,q˜≥0,(4.9)G′(π)=λ˜p˜η1D(π,η1)−λ˜q˜η2D(1−π,η2).By change of variable, we findG′(π)=λ˜p˜η1∫0∞ex−11+π(ex−1)e−η1xdx+λ˜q˜η2∫−∞0ex−11+π(ex−1)e−η2|x|dx=λ˜p˜η1D(π,η1)−λ˜q˜η2∫0∞(ey−1)1+(1−π)(ey−1)e−η2ydy=λ˜p˜η1D(π,η1)−λ˜q˜η2D(1−π,η2).□The behavior of G′(.), the growth rate at the risky portfolio holding, depends only on the Lévy measure. Theorem 2 posits that G′(.) is strictly increasing in the rate at which jumps occur, the probability of upward jumps, and the upward log-jump amplitude. It is strictly decreasing in the probability of downward jumps and downward log-jump amplitude.To implement Newton’s algorithm for the Kou market, we also need the second derivative of G(.). An analytic formula for G′′(π) now follows.Theorem 3Let π ∈ (0, 1). For the Kou model with parameters η1 ≥ 1, η2 > 0,λ˜>0,p˜+q˜=1,p˜,q˜≥0,(4.10)G′′(π)=−λ˜p˜(η1+π)π(1−π)2+λ˜p˜η1(η1+2π−1)π(1−π)2J(π,η1)−λ˜q˜(η2+1−π)(1−π)π2+λ˜q˜η2(η2+1−2π)(1−π)π2J(1−π,η2).We computeG′′(π)directly by taking derivative ofG′(π)given in (4.9) with respect to π(4.11)G′′(π)=λ˜p˜η1D′(π,η1)+λ˜q˜η2D′(1−π,η2).By part (4) of Proposition 1, it follows that for α ∈ (0, 1) and η > 0(4.12)D′(α,η)=1(1−α)2J(α,η)+11−αJ′(α,η)−1η(1−α)2.By using integration by parts as well as the recursive formula in part (1) of Proposition 1, we findJ′(α,η)=−∫0∞ydy(1+αy)2(1+y)η=−1α∫0∞dy(1+αy)(1+y)η+1α∫0∞dy(1+αy)2(1+y)η=−1αJ(α,η)+1α[1α−ηαJ(α,η+1)]=−1α(1−α)+η+α−1α(1−α)J(α,η).Therefore, we haveD′(α,η)=1(1−α)2J(α,η)+11−α×[−1α(1−α)+η+α−1α(1−α)J(α,η)]−1η(1−α)2=−η+ααη(1−α)2+η+2α−1α(1−α)2J(α,η),which immediately yields (4.10).□By employing these analytic formulas forG′(π)andG′′(π)presented in Theorems 2 and 3, we can use Newton’s algorithms proposed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 to numerically compute the optimal portfolios for both uninformed and informed investors in the Kou jump-diffusion market. The corresponding numerical results are reported in Appendix A.We closely follow Madan (2010) and Madan and Seneta (1990) for a description of the Variance Gamma (VG) process. Application and further developments are reported in Angelos (2013), Carr and Wu (2004), Hirsa and Madan (2004), Madan et al. (1998) and Seneta (2004). Madan (2010) describes the Variance Gamma process X(t) as a Brownian motion with drift θ and volatility σ time changed by a gamma process with a mean rate of one unit, and variance rate ν. Thus, for a standard Brownian motion B(t), and a gamma process Γ(t; ν),X(t;σ,ν,θ)=θΓ(t;ν)+σB(Γ(t;ν))is a Variance Gamma process, with parameters (σ, ν, θ). It is a positive increasing process with independent and identically distributed increments over disjoint intervals of length h, that have a gamma density1νhνΓ(hν)xhν−1exp(−xν).It is a Lévy process with characteristic functionE[exp(iuX(t))]=(11−iuθν+12σ2νu2)tν.The Variance Gamma process is a pure jump Lévy process with parameters C, G, and M (cf. Carr, Geman, Madan, and Yor, 2002), and density(5.1)v(x)=Cexp(−G|x|)|x|I{x<0}+Cexp(−Mx)xI{x>0},whereC=1νG=1σ(2ν+θ2σ2)+θσ2M=1σ(2ν+θ2σ2)−θσ2The Variance Gamma process is of finite variation and can be written as the difference of two increasing processes. The total positive and negative variations areCMandCG,respectively.The mispriced asymmetric VG market has stock price dynamic:(5.2)d(logSt)=(μt−12σt2)dt+σtdYt+dXt,t∈[0,T],whereYt=pWt+qUt,p2+q2=1,p≥0,q>0,is defined by Eq. (2.3). q2 is the proportion of asymmetric information in the market. Wtis standard Brownian motion, whileU=(Ut)is a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with mean-reversion rate λ > 0, defined by Eq. (2.4). λ is a measure of mispricing.Our model (5.2), has percentage return:(5.3)dStSt−=μtdt+σtdYt+∫R(ex−1)N(dt,dx),t∈[0,T].Let XVG≡ (Xt)t ≥ 0 be a Variance Gamma process with Lévy triple (γ, 0, vVG), whereγ=∫−11xvVG(x)dx. We assume that XVGhas parameters C, G, M, and Lévy measure(5.4)v(x)≡vVG(x)=Cexp(−G|x|)|x|I{x<0}+Cexp(−Mx)xI{x>0},where C > 0, G > 0, M > 0, G ≥ M.This market occurs whenq=0(that is, there is no asymmetry). It consists of a single risk-free bond B that earns risk–free interest rt, and has price dynamic given by (2.1).(5.5)dStSt−=μtdt+σtdBt+∫R(ex−1)N(dt,dx),(5.6)XtVG=∫RxN(t,dx),where N(t, A) is the Poisson Random measure onR+×(R−{0}),A∈B(R−{0}),that counts the jumps of XVGin (0, t), t ∈ [0, T], T > 0 (cf. Applebaum, 2004). The total return on the stock is;bt=μt+M1≡μt+∫R(ex−1)v(x)dx.The VG process is a pure jump Lévy process with an infinite arrival rate of small jumps since∫Rv(x)dx=∞and having paths of finite variation with∫−11|x|v(x)dx<∞.In this section we present a general result for instantaneous centralized moments of returns. Let v( · ) be the Lévy measure of an arbitrary pure jump Lévy process X.Definition 1Instantaneous centralized moments of returnsDefine the objects Mjand Ksby the prescriptions:(5.7)Mj=∫R(ex−1)jv(dx),(5.8)Ks=∫R(esx−1)v(dx).Mjis called the jth instantaneous centralized moments of returns of the Lévy process X, with measure v( · ). Ksis a kernel used to calculate Mj.The following lemma is easily derived from the binomial theorem. It will be quite useful in the sequel.Lemma 1If there exists k ∈ N such that∫R(ejx−1)v(dx)<∞for each 0 ≤ j ≤ k, then Mj and Kj exist, and(5.9)Mj=∑i=1j(−1)j−i(ji)Ki.Newtons’ algorithm requires explicit values for the first and second derivatives ofG(α)=∫Rlog(1+α(ex−1))v(dx),which must be estimated if an analytic formula is not available. In the sequel, we estimate G(α) by its kth degree Taylor series Gk(α). We use the instantaneous centralized moments of returns Mj, to approximate the function G and hence G′ and G′′, by a truncated Taylor series. The larger the value of k, the better the approximation of G. We have the following result which is general for all models where Mkexists.Proposition 2If there exists k ∈ N such thatMj=∫R(ex−1))jv(dx)<∞for each 1 ≤ j ≤ k, then G( · ) has a k-th degree polynomial approximation Gk( · ) given by:(5.10)Gk(α)=∑j=1k(−1)j−1Mjjαj,α∈[0,1],with(5.11)Gk′(α)=∑j=1k(−1)j−1Mjαj−1andGk′′(α)=∑j=2k(−1)j−1(j−1)Mjαj−2.This results follows directly by expanding G(α) as a Taylor series aboutα=0.□For the VG market with parameters C, G, and M, the approximating polynomial Gkis controlled by M, and we chosek=[M],the greatest integer less than M. The derivativesGk′andGk′′will be required in Newton’s algorithm to compute the optimal portfolios.Definition 2The kth centralized moment of instantaneous returns for the VG market is Mk, with kernel Ks, define by the prescriptions:(5.12)Mk=∫R(ex−1)kvVG(x)dxandKs=∫R(esx−1)vVG(x)dx.The following result simplifies future computations of the ICMR for the VG market.Lemma 2Let u, v > 0. Then(5.13)∫0+∞(e−ux−e−vx)dxx=ln(vu).Fix v > u > 0 and t > 0.∫0+∞(e−ux−e−vx)dxx=∫0+∞∫uvd(e−tx)dxx=∫0+∞[∫uv−xe−txdt]dxx=−∫0+∞[∫uve−txdt]dx=−∫uv[∫0+∞e−txdx]dt=−∫uv[e−tx−t|0+∞]dt=∫uv1tdt=ln(vu).□We are now able to compute the VG kernel Ks.Lemma 3Let XVG be a Variance Gamma process with parameters C, G, and M. Then for 0 ≤ s < M,(5.14)Ks=Clog[GM(G+s)(M−s)],and Mk is given by Lemma1, provided k ≤ [M].Let 0 ≤ s < M. From Lemma 2, we getKs=∫R(esx−1)vVG(x)dx=C∫−∞0−(esx−1)eGx−xdx+C∫0+∞(esx−1)e−Mxxdx=C∫0+∞(e−sx−1)e−Gxxdx+C∫0+∞(esx−1)e−Mxxdx=C∫0+∞(e−(G+s)x−e−Gx+e−(M−s)x−e−Mx)dxxdxThusKs=C[log(GG+s)+log(MM−s)]=Clog[GM(G+s)(M−s)].□With these explicit values forK1,K2,…,K5,in hand, we can now compute the first five (5) instantaneous centralized moments of returns,M1,M2,…,M5,which are required for the estimation of the optimal portfolio, π. Let X be the VG process with parameters C, G, and M. It follows easily from Lemma 1 thatM1=K1=Clog[GM(G+1)(M−1)],ifM>1.M2=Clog[(G+1)2(M−1)2GM(G+2)(M−2)],ifM>2.M3=Clog[GM(G+2)3(M−2)3(G+3)(M−3)(G+1)3(M−1)3],ifM>3M4=Clog[(G+3)4(M−3)4(G+1)4(M−1)4GM(G+4)(M−4)(G+2)6(M−2)6],ifM>4.M5=Clog[GM(G+4)5(M−4)5(G+2)10(M−2)10(G+5)(M−5)(G+3)10(M−3)10(G+1)5(M−1)5],ifM>5.We now give a general formula for kth instantaneous centralize moment of return, Mk.Lemma 4Let X be a VG process with parameters C, G, and M. Let k ∈ N, with k ≤ [M]. Then the kth ICMR is(5.15)Mk=ClogAk≡C∑j=0k(−1)(k−j+1)(kj)log[(G+j)(M−j)]where(5.16)Ak=▵Πj=0k[(G+j)(M−j)]((−1)(k−j+1)(kj)).If M > k then by Lemma 1, Ksexist fors=0,1,…,k,andMk=C∑j=1k(−1)k−j(kj)log[GM(G+j)(M−j)]=C∑j=1klog[GM(G+j)(M−j)](−1)k−j(kj)=C∑j=1klog[GM](−1)k−j(kj)+C∑j=1klog[(G+j)(M−j)](−1)k−j+1(kj).ThereforeMk=Clog[GM]∑j=1k(−1)k−j(kj)+Clog∏j=1k[(G+j)(M−j)](−1)k−j+1(kj)=Clog[GM](−1)k+1(kj)+Clog∏j=1k[(G+j)(M−j)](−1)k−j+1(kj)=Clog(∏j=0k[(G+j)(M−j)]((−1)(k−j+1)(kj)))=▵ClogAk.□Let π be the optimal portfolio that maximizes the expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth at time T > 0, with initial wealth x > 0. We now give explicit formulas for the approximation of π, based on the Taylor series approximation of GVG(π).Theorem 4Let πibe the optimal portfolio that maximizes the expected logarithmic utility from terminal wealth for the ith investor in the VG market with parameters r, μ, σ,  C, G, M. Assume that k ≤ [M], and thatπtk,iis the approximation of πibased on the kth degree polynomial approximation Gk, of the instantaneous centralized moment generating function G(.) given by Proposition 2. The optimal portfolio of the ith investor is(5.17)πtk,i=μt−rtσt2+υtiσt+Gk′(πtk,i)σt2,whereυtiis given by Eq. (3.5).ProofThis result follows directly from Theorem 1.□Observe from Theorem 4 that the optimal portfolios are basically fixed points of the first derivative of the function Gk(.), which is a moment generating function (the function Gk(.) generates instantaneous centralized moments of returns). Each optimal portfolio is the Merton optimal (for the symmetric market without jumps) plus an excess holding of risky asset. This excess consists of two parts. The first is purely random, and depends on information asymmetry, mean-reversion speed and volatility, while the second additive component is inversely proportional to the diffusive variance (sigma squared) and directly proportional to G′(.), the growth rate of G(.) at the risky asset proportion level. Consequently, the optimal portfolios are very sensitive to information asymmetry, mean reversion speed, volatility, Sharp ratio and activity of the Levy measure. For example, as the diffusive volatility increases, the agents basically hold the deterministic Merton optimal. The excess stock holding is basically positive or negative in lockstep with the sign and magnitude ofGk′(.); that is, whether Gkis increasing or decreasing at that stock proportion.The behavior of G′(.) depends only on the Lévy measure, which is driven by the parameters. To implement Newton’s algorithm for the VG market, we also need the second derivative of G(.). There are many independent parameters (in addition to functions thereof) involved in the respective derivatives, and only extensive simulation can provide a proper sensitivity analysis of the impact of these parameters on the optimal portfolios.Remark 9For the VG market with parameters C, G, M, the approximating polynomial Gkis controlled by M, and we chosek=[M],the greatest integer less than M. An observation of the data in Table 1 of Carr et al. (2002) shows that the values of M range between 25 and 138. Thus polynomials of degree k ≥ 25 may be used to approximate π using Newton’s method. However, it is best to use a smaller k value if Mkis very small, for example if it is less than say,0.5×10−6.By using the formulas forG′(π)andG′′(π)presented in Proposition 2, we employ Newton’s algorithms proposed in Sections 3.1 and 3.1 to numerically compute the optimal portfolios for both uninformed and informed investors in the VG jump–diffusion market. The corresponding numerical results for Bank of America stock, based on the parametersC=65.65,G=47.38,M=46.98in Carr et al. (2002), are reported in Appendix B.
