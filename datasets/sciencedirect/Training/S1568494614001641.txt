@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this paper is to propose a method to aggregate the opinion of several decision makers on different criteria, regarding a set of alternatives, where the judgment of the decision makers are represented by generalized interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. A generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy number based technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is proposed that can reflect subjective judgment and objective information in real life. The weights of criteria and performance rating values of criteria are linguistic variables expressed as generalized interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to elaborate the proposed method for the selection of a suitable robot according to our requirements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The widespread applications and the rapid growth of the robot industry are creating new challenges in robot control development. Recently Brogårdh [9] presents some key notes on future industrial robot development. He thinks that a lot of research and development is needed to obtain a more widely use of robot automation in industry. In this regards, Gonzalez et al. [20] combine the evolutionary robotics approach with action selection. Boughdiri et al. [8] used model-based control for a multi-fingered robot hand grasping an object with known geometrical characteristics. García-López et al. [18] analyzed the movement performed by certain animals and kinematic analysis of a single leg of a hexapod robot is introduced and the trajectory generation is implemented. To improve product quality and increase productivity, robot selection has always been an important issue for manufacturing companies. Robot selection attributes, e.g. reliability, cost, man-machine interface, load capacity and availability of diagnostic software are considered for the selection of a robot. There are two main categories of criteria for the selection of a robot: One is objective criteria and the other is subjective criteria. Cost, reliability, load capacity, repeatability and positioning accuracy criteria are included in the category of objective criteria. Vendor's service contract, training, man-machine interface and programming flexibility criteria are included in the category of subjective criteria.Several techniques for the selection of a suitable alternative are available in literature. Hwang and Yoon [21] developed a novel approach to multi-attribute/multi-criteria decision making (MADM/MCDM) problems by using technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is a useful and practical technique for the selection and ranking of alternatives [1,7,10,11,19,23,24,34,38,43]. The basic concept of TOPSIS is that the chosen alternative should have the smallest distance from the positive-ideal solution and the largest distance from the negative-ideal solution. In the TOPSIS theory, crisp values are used for weights and performance ratings of the criteria. The multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides an effective framework for comparison based on the evaluation of multiple conflicting criteria. The decision process of selecting a suitable alternative usually has to take many factors into considerations; for instance, organizational goals, risks, needs, limited resources, benefits, etc. In many cases, human judgment and preference are ambiguous, vague and cannot be estimated with exact numeric value, so the crisp values are not suitable to model real world situations. To solve the ambiguity and vagueness in information from human judgement and preference, Zadeh [41] proposed the concept of fuzzy set theory and successfully used to handle imprecision (or uncertainty) in decision making problems [42]. A more practical approach is to use linguistic assessments instead of numerical values. TOPSIS is extended to fuzzy environment [12,22]. Fuzzy numbers are applied and used to establish a prototype fuzzy TOPSIS [14,28], Lot of work on fuzzy TOPSIS has been developed and used by several researchers [12,15,22,25,27,33,35,36,39,40]. Extension of TOPSIS method for triangular fuzzy numbers is developed in [12,16]. Afterward in decision making problems with fuzzy data, an algorithm is developed to extend TOPSIS in fuzzy environment [22]. Xu and Chen [37] extended TOPSIS for fuzzy multiple attribute group decision making problems. For the better modelling of information, extensions of fuzzy set are given like intuitionistic fuzzy set [2,3]; hesitant fuzzy set [32]; hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set [30]. Intuitionistic fuzzy set has been widely applied to decision making problems because it is highly useful to express information under fuzzy environment [7]. TOPSIS is further extended for trapezoidal valued intuitionistic fuzzy set [5]. This technique is also generalized for hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set [6]. Dubois [17] in his paper presented an excellent analysis of old decision techniques and motivated the scientists to use suggested new decision making notions. The selection of a suitable robot is becoming more and more complex because of the increase in robot manufacturers, configurations, and available options. Buyers faced the situation of having to make a choice from among several robots which are capable of performing a specified task. By motivation of new techniques of decision analysis due to Dubois [17], we extend TOPSIS for GITFNs with preference of decision makers, to select a suitable robot for his specific needs. This proposed technique is based on linguistic variables as well as membership function in the form of fuzzy intervals.Rest of the article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review fuzzy set, interval valued fuzzy sets, generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GITFNs) and some basic laws of GITFNs. In Section 3, we proposed a modified version of TOPSIS for GITFNS in the form of steps. In Section 4, modified fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied for the selection of a robot, where the ratings of various alternatives versus various subjective criteria and the weights of all criteria are assessed in linguistic terms represented by GITFNs. This illustrative example is given to see the feasibility of the proposed fuzzy TOPSIS method. Conclusion is given in the last section.As preparation for introducing our new aggregation operators, some preliminary concepts are given in this section.Let X be a crisp universe of generic elements, afuzzy set B in the universe X is a mapping from X to [0, 1]. For any x ∈X, the value B(x) is called the degree of membership of x in B.Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be the set of the attributes, P(X) be the power set of X. Let CS([0, 1]) stand for the set of all closed subintervals of [0, 1].Definition 2.1[31,42] Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a universe of discourse. An interval valued fuzzy set (IVFS) in X is an expression M given by M={〈xi, fM(xi)〉|xi∈X}, where fM:X→CS([0, 1]). The interval fM(xi) represent the degree of membership of the element xiin the set M, such thatxi→fM(xi)=[fM−(xi),fM+(xi)]where0≤fM−(xi)≤fM+(xi)≤1. Set of all IVFSs on X is denoted by IVFS(X).Definition 2.2[29] A generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number (GTFN) denoted by X=(m1, m2, m3, m4;h), i.e.X(x)=h−m2−xαform1<x≤m2(α>0),hform2≤x≤m3,h−x−m3βform4>x≥m3(β>0),0forx≤m1andx≥m4.where m1≤m2≤m3≤m4, m1, m2, m3,m4∈R, h is height of X and h∈[0, 1] and α=m2−m1>0 and β=m4−m3>0 are called the left and right spread, respectively.Definition 2.3[13] Let AL(xi) and AU(xi) be two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and lethxiLandhxiUdenote the heights of AL(xi) and AU(xi), respectively. Letx1iL,x2iL,x3iL,x4iL,x1iU,x2iU,x3iU,x4iU∈R. A generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy set (GITFS) A defined on the universe of discourse X={x1, x2, …, xn} is represented by the following:A={〈xi,[AL(xi),AU(xi)]〉|xi∈X}={〈xi,[(x1iL,x2iL,x3iL,x4iL;hxiL),(x1iU,x2iU,x3iU,x4iU;hxiU)]〉|xi∈X},wherex1iL≤x2iL≤x3iL≤x4iL,x1iU≤x2iU≤x3iU≤x4iU,0≤hxiL≤hxiU≤1,x1iU≤x1iL, andx4iL≤x4iU. Moreover,AL(xi)=(x1iL,x2iL,x3iL,x4iL;hxiL),AU(xi)=(x1iU,x2iU,x3iU,x4iU;hxiU), and AL(xi)⊂AU(xi).A GITFN A(x)=[AL(x), AU(x)] consists of the two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbersAL(x)=(x1L,x2L,x3L,x4L;hxL)andAU(x)=(x1U,x2U,x3U,x4U;hxU), where AL(x) is called “the lower trapezoidal fuzzy number,” and AU(x) is called “the upper trapezoidal fuzzy number”.IfhxL=hxU=1, then the GITFN A(x) becomes a normal interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy number. If AL(x)=AU(x), then A(x) becomes a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number. Ifx2L=x3Landx2U=x3U, then A(x) is a generalized interval valued triangular fuzzy number. Ifx2L=x3L,x2U=x3U, andhxL=hxU=1, then A is a normal interval valued triangular fuzzy number. Ifx1L=x2L=x3L=x4L,x1U=x2U=x3U=x4U, andhxL=hxU=1, then AL(x) and AU(x) become crisp values, and A(x) is a crisp interval.We call[(x1L,x2L,x3L,x4L;hxL),(x1U,x2U,x3U,x4U;hxU)]a GITFN.Definition 2.4[4] Let X={x1, …, xn} be a universe of discourse,a˜i=[(a1iL,a2iL,a3iL,a4iL;haiL),(a1iU,a2iU,a3iU,a4iU;haiU)], andb˜i=[(b1iL,b2iL,b3iL,b4iL;hbiL),(b1iU,b2iU,b3iU,b4iU;hbiU)],(i=1,2,…,n)be two GITFNs on X, thend(a˜i,b˜i)=18|haiL×a1iL−b1iL×hbiL|+|haiL×a2iL−b2iL×hbiL|+|haiL×a3iL−b3iL×hbiL|+|haiL×a4iL−b4iL×hbiL|+|haiU×a1iU−b1iU×hbiU|+|haiU×a2iU−b2iU×hbiU|+|haiU×a3iU−b3iU×hbiU|+|haiU×a4iU−b4iU×hbiU|,is called the distance betweena˜iandb˜i.Definition 2.5[13] Leta˜=[(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;haL),(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;haU)], andb˜=[(b1L,b2L,b3L,b4L;hbL),(b1U,b2U,b3U,b4U;hbU)]be two GITFNs, thena˜+b˜=[(a1L+b1L,a2L+b2L,a3L+b3L,a4L+b4L;min(haL,hbL)),(a1U+b1U,a2U+b2U,a3U+b3U,a4U+b4U;min(haU,hbU))];Definition 2.6[13] Leta˜=[(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;haL),(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;haU)], andb˜=[(b1L,b2L,b3L,b4L;hbL),(b1U,b2U,b3U,b4U;hbU)]be two GITFNs, thena˜·b˜=[(a1Lb1L,a2Lb2L,a3Lb3L,a4Lb4L;min(haL,hbL)),(a1Ub1U,a2Ub2U,a3Ub3U,a4Ub4U;min(haU,hbU))];Definition 2.7[13] Leta˜=[(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;haL),(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;haU)],and q be an arbitrary real number, thenq·a˜=a˜·q=[(a1L·q,a2L·q,a3L·q,a4L·q;haL)),(a1U·q,a2U·q,a3U·q,a4U·q;haU))];ifq≥0,[(a4L·q,a3L·q,a2L·q,a1L·q;haL)),(a4U·q,a3U·q,a2U·q,a1U·q;haU))];ifq≤0,In general, multi-criteria group decision making problem includes uncertain and imprecise data and information. We propose the following multi-criteria group decision making problems where all the criteria values are expressed in GITFNs.Group decision making problems which involves the following steps:Step 1.LetX˜=[x˜ij]m×nbe a fuzzy decision matrix for the MCDM problem and the following notations are used to depict the considered problems:E={e1, e2, …, eK} is the set of the experts involved in the decision process; A={A1, A2, …, Am} is the set of the considered alternatives; C={C1, C2, …, Cn} is the set of the criteria used for evaluating the alternatives.Performance of alternative Aiwith respect to criterion Cjis denoted asx˜ij.In a group decision environment with K persons, the importance of the criteria and the rating of alternatives with respect to each criterion can be computed by:x˜ij=1K[x˜ij1+x˜ij2+⋯+x˜ijK]w˜ij=1K[w˜ij1+w˜ij2+⋯+w˜ijK]Givenx˜ij=x1ijL,x2ijL,x3ijL,x4ijL;hxijL,x1ijU,x2ijU,x3ijU,x4ijU;hxijU, the normalized performance rating can be calculated by:n˜ij=x1ijLx4j+,x2ijLx4j+,x3ijLx4j+,x4ijLx4j+;hxijL,x1ijUx4j+,x2ijUx4j+,x3ijUx4j+,x4ijUx4j+;hxijU, i=1, 2, …, n, j∈Ωbwherex4j+=maxix4ijU,j∈Ωbn˜ij=x1j−x4ijL,x1j−x3ijL,x1j−x2ijL,x1j−x1ijL;hxijL,x1j−x4ijU,x1j−x3ijU,x1j−x2ijU,x1j−x1ijU;hxijU, i=1, 2, …, n, j∈Ωcwherex1j−=maxix1ijU,j∈Ωcwhere Ωband Ωcare associated with benefit and cost criteria, respectively. This normalization method is to preserve the property that the ranges of normalized interval numbers fall within the interval [0, 1].Weighted normalized matrixV˜can be constructed as follows:V˜=[v˜ij]n×mwherev˜ij=w˜j×n˜ij.Let Ωbbe a collection of benefit criteria (i.e., the larger Cj, the greater preference) and Ωcbe a collection of cost criteria (i.e., the smaller Cj, the greater preference). The generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy positive-ideal solution (GIT-FPIS), denoted asA˜+=(V˜1+V˜2+…V˜n+), and the generalized interval valued trapezoidal fuzzy negative-ideal solution (GIT-FNIS), denoted asA˜−=(V˜1−V˜2−…V˜n−), are defined as follows:A˜+=[((maxiv1ijL,maxiv2ijL,maxiv3ijL,maxiv4ijL;maxihvijL)|j∈Ωb,(miniv1ijL,miniv2ijL,miniv3ijL,miniv4ijL;minihvijL)|j∈Ωc),((maxiv1ijU,maxiv2ijU,maxiv3ijU,maxiv4ijU;maxihvijU)|j∈Ωb,(miniv1ijU,miniv2ijU,miniv3ijU,miniv4ijU;minihvijU)|j∈Ωc)]i=1,2,…,m,A˜+=(V˜1+V˜2+…V˜n+)whereV˜j+=[(v1jL+,v2jL+,v3jL+,v4jL+;hvjL+),(v1jU+,v2jU+,v3jU+,v4jU+;hvjU+)](j=1,2,…,n).A˜−=[((miniv1ijL,miniv2ijL,miniv3ijL,miniv4ijL;minihvijL)|j∈Ωb,(maxiv1ijL,maxiv2ijL,maxiv3ijL,maxiv4ijL;maxihvijL)|j∈Ωc),((miniv1ijU,miniv2ijU,miniv3ijU,miniv4ijU;minihvijU)|j∈Ωb,(maxiv1ijU,maxiv2ijU,maxiv3ijU,maxiv4ijU;maxihvijU)|j∈Ωc)]i=1,2,…,m,A˜−=(V˜1−V˜2−…V˜n−)whereV˜j−=[(v1jL−,v2jL−,v3jL−,v4jL−;hvjL−),(v1jU−,v2jU−,v3jU−,v4jU−;hvjU−)](j=1,2,…,n).Construct ideal separation matrix (D+) and anti-ideal separation matrix (D−) which are defined as follows:D+=d(v˜11,V˜1+)+d(v˜12,V˜2+)+⋯+d(v˜1n,V˜n+)d(v˜21,V˜1+)+d(v˜22,V˜2+)+⋯+d(v˜2n,V˜n+)⋮⋮⋮⋮d(v˜m1,V˜1+)+d(v˜m2,V˜2+)+⋯+d(v˜mn,V˜n+)andD−=d(v˜11,V˜1−)+d(v˜12,V˜2−)+⋯+d(v˜1n,V˜n−)d(v˜21,V˜1−)+d(v˜22,V˜2−)+⋯+d(v˜2n,V˜n−)⋮⋮⋮⋮d(v˜m1,V˜1−)+d(v˜m2,V˜2−)+⋯+d(v˜mn,V˜n−)Calculate the relative closeness (RC) of each alternative to the ideal solution.RC(Ai)=Di−Di++Di−,i=1,2,…,m.whereDi−=∑j=1nd(v˜ij,V˜j−)andDi+=∑j=1nd(v˜ij,V˜j+).Rank all the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, m) according to the closeness coefficient RC(Ai), the greater the value RC(Ai), the better the alternative Ai.In this example, we utilized our proposed method given in Section 3 to get the best alternative. Numerical example discussed is from Liang and Wang [26]. Manufacturing company requires a robot to perform a material-handling task. Three robots R1, R2 and R3 are chosen for further evaluation. Decision making problem is defined and criteria to establish this evaluation are considered. The DMs are asked to express their opinions with respect to criteria and form a fuzzy decision matrix. DMs can assess and provide their recognition by linguistic variables. A GITFN matrix is more naturally utilized than the traditional fuzzy decision matrix. Proposed technique is applied on this example with following step wise procedure.Step 1.The three possible alternatives Ri(i=1, 2, 3) are to be evaluated using the linguistic information by three decision makers Dk(k=1, 2, 3). Robot selection criteria and the importance weights of the criteria are provided by linguistic variables as shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Interpretation of linguistic variables in terms of GITFNs is given in Tables 3 and 4. Then, these linguistic variables are converted into GITFNs in Tables 5–7for weights of criteria according to decision makers D1, D2 and D3, respectively. The ratings of three subjective criteria in linguistic variables is shown in Table 8. The ratings of these three subjective criteria in GITFNs form is shown in Tables 9–11according to DMs D1, D2 and D3, respectively. Rating of three objective criteria is given in Table 12in the form of GITFNs.Average weights of DMs opinions from Tables 5–7 shown in Table 13as follows.Average rating of subjective criteria of Tables 9–11 in Table 14.Normalized value is calculated in Table 15from Tables 12 and 14.Weighted normalized value is calculated in Tables 16 and 17from normalized value of Table 15 and weighted value of Table 13..Ideal separation matrix (D+) and anti-ideal separation matrix (D−) is as follows:D+=0.15559+0.274+0.08098+0+0+0.18750.15559+0+0.0271+0.0168+0.078+0.02950+0.13725+0+0.0259+0.07725+0=0.69810.30720.2404D−=0+0+0+0.0259+0.08196+00+0.274+0.0538+0.0091+0.00388+0.15790.1556+0.1367+0.081+0+0.0047+0.1875=0.10790.49880.5656Relative closeness (RC) of each alternative to the ideal solutions:RC1=0.1338, RC2=0.6188, RC3=0.7017.Alternatives R1, R2 and R3 according to the closeness coefficient RC1, RC2 and RC3: R3≻R2≻R1.Thus the most desirable alternative is R3.
