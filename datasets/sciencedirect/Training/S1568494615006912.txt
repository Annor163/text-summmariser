@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study provides a timely and flexible location-aware service (LAS) to mobile users in a dynamic environment. Few previous studies have examined similar concepts. In the proposed methodology, the inaccuracy of user positioning and the uncertainty of manual service preparation are considered and modeled by using fuzzy numbers. These numbers are used as inputs to establish a fuzzy integer-nonlinear programming model applied in identifying the most suitable service location and path. A required service is prepared immediately before a user reaches the recommended service location. To manage simultaneous requests from multiple users, the concepts of fuzzy modeling, route planning, and parallel machine scheduling are combined. Thus, the proposed LAS can distribute multiple users among service locations, thereby enabling users to avoid unnecessary waiting, which is a major problem associated with existing LASs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, two experiments were conducted in small areas in Taichung City and Taipei City, Taiwan. The experimental results revealed that the waiting times of users were substantially reduced, increasing the average satisfaction level. However, improving the accuracy of user positioning does not necessarily facilitate achieving a high average satisfaction level.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Location-aware service (LAS) has recently received a considerable amount of attention in the context of ambient intelligence (AmI), mainly because of the prevalence of cell phones and applications. An LAS, or location-based service, provides relevant information and services to a user through interpretation of the user's location and other contextual elements [7,12]. LAS systems have been applied to online social networking [1,24], instant personal recommendation [5,19,21], and other areas. A different research field that is similarly critical is to provide ubiquitous services to users regardless of their location [6].The objective of this study was to create a flexible just-in-time LAS for mobile users in a ubiquitous environment. This is not an easy task because of the uncertainties of such an environment. The first source of uncertainty is the interpretation of a user's needs. Because few options can be provided to a user with his or her cell phone, confirming a user's needs is difficult. To address this difficulty, Kotsakis and Ketselidis [17] suggested using linguistic terms to describe a user's subjective feelings. Similarly, Anagnostopoulos and Hadjiefthymiades [3] represented a user's context by using variables assuming fuzzy values.The second source of uncertainty is the detection of a user's position. According to Virrantaus et al. [22], LASs are supported by the processing of geographic information system data. To increase certainty, mathematical modeling, optimization, simulation, statistics, fuzzy modeling, cellular automata, knowledge-based systems, fractal analysis, neural computing, spatial multimedia, visualization, and genetic programming are applied. Astrain et al. [4] established a fuzzy inference system to estimate the location of a user. The inputs of the fuzzy inference system are Wi-Fi signal strengths in specific zones, which are expressed in linguistic terms. The output from the fuzzy inference system facilitates associating the user with a specific zone and establishing membership. Such a positioning method is common for indoor LAS applications (e.g., Alonso et al. [2], Chen et al. [8], and Hernández et al. [15]). The positioning accuracy is approximately 2.0–2.5m [4]. For outdoor LAS applications, users are usually positioned using the Global Positioning System (GPS) applications installed on their cell phones. This positioning method is also subject to inaccuracy; the detection error may be as high as 20m. To examine this inaccuracy, Lin and Chen [19] estimated the position of a user by using a fuzzy set. The travel time between two locations was calculated as a fuzzy value. Chen and Wu [11] evaluated the timeliness of a path by using a fuzzy value. By comparing the timeliness values of different paths, the just-in-time path and service location can be recommended to a user.The third source of uncertainty is the determination of a user's preferences and is addressed using fuzzy logic. Mateo et al. [20] established a set of fuzzy inference rules to recommend the most suitable nearby restaurant to a user by evaluating the user's needs. Anagnostopoulos and Hadjiefthymiades [3] applied a similar approach to classify the contexts and activities of multiple users by comparing their routines. Recently, Chen et al. [12] recommended a parking station that most closely fitted a user's needs by establishing fuzzy inference to compare alternatives.This study involved developing a flexible just-in-time LAS in which(1)there are multiple service locations along the route, from the starting point to the destination of a user;“just-in-time” means that the required service is ready exactly when a user reaches the recommended service location [10]; and“flexible” means that users are provided with a choice of multiple service locations.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, the concepts of a fuzzy just-in-time service location and path in a ubiquitous service network are defined. To identify the fuzzy just-in-time service location and path for a user, a fuzzy integer-nonlinear programming (FINLP) problem was formulated and solved, as detailed in Section 2. To manage simultaneous requests from multiple users, the FINLP model is extended by incorporating the concept of parallel machine scheduling, as discussed in Section 3. The application of the proposed methodology is illustrated using an example. In addition, to elaborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, Section 4 presents the results of two experiments conducted in small areas in two cities. Finally, Section 5 offers the conclusion and provides directions for future research.
