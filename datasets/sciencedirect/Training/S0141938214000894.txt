@&#ABSTRACT@&#
New chiral compounds of the steroid type, namely, 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone, were synthesized and exhibited high helical twisting power (HTP) in nematic liquid crystals E63 and LC-1289. The peculiarities of the molecular structure of chiral compounds (CCs) and their high degree of chirality were discussed. Quite small concentrations of chiral compounds in both nematic solvents were needed to obtain a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure with the selective light reflection in the visible range of the spectrum. The insignificant temperature dependence of the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection obtained on the whole cholesteric range for all studied liquid crystalline (LC) systems could be related to relatively rigid molecular structure of the chiral compounds. The cholesteric LC mixtures comprising 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone were characterized by the phase stability and the stability of reflective characteristics in time that makes it possible to consider this series of dopants as appropriate for development of bistable cholesteric reflective LC displays.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Chiral compounds are widely used as dopants in liquid crystals to investigate the phenomenon of chirality and to search for new liquid crystalline states and properties [1–5]. The development of chiral compounds possessing a certain set of characteristics is necessary and important for many practical applications such as different electro-optical devices, LC displays, and polymer films [6,7].Nowadays bistable cholesteric reflective LC display (ChLCD) technology has growth potential since such displays consume low power and can be flexible [8–10]. A recent study revealed that cholesteric displays can be used according to the need for static as well as video images [11]. For this type of display the cholesteric material preferably should consist of a nematic LC and a chiral dopant. To obtain the effect of selective light reflection the chiral dopant must induce a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure in the nematic LC (the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection, λmax, is in the visible range of 400–800nm). To fulfil this requirement the chiral compound should have a high HTP or high amounts of the chiral compound are needed to be used. A high concentration of the CC influences undesirable functional characteristics of the nematic, such as, the temperature range of the mesophase, threshold voltage, viscosity and others. A highly chiral dopant should be expected to confer a high helical twisting power that allows one to reduce its concentration in the LC system. Besides chirality as a prerequisite, the molecular structure of a chiral compound usually undergoes synthetic modifications by introduction of ligands of different kinds to achieve the highest possible value of helical twisting power in nematic LCs [12–16]. To predict the increase of HTP value becomes more complicated in the case of using multicomponent nematic solvents. Different theoretical methods have been suggested for estimation of helical twisting power of chiral compounds [for example, [17] and references therein], but calculation of all types of intermolecular interaction, especially, for multicomponent systems is still a very difficult task.To retain the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection and, correspondingly, the reflected color unchangeable in the wide range of ambient temperature (dλmax/dT≈0) is another crucial condition, in particular, for development of ChLCDs. Different modifications of molecular structure of chiral compounds with the aim to obtain high HTP values often result in an undesirable shift of λmax with temperature. Inconsiderable in number, investigations do not determine to the full extent the features of molecular structure of CCs that influence the dλmax/dT parameter. In many cases two or more chiral dopants are used in order to compensate the temperature dependence of λmax.High solubility of chiral compounds in nematic solvents and, correspondingly, the phase stability of LC mixtures, that provides the stability of mentioned characteristics (HTP value, dλmax/dT parameter) in time, is one more problem under study. In general, to trace the origins of low solubility of chiral compounds is difficult. Usually, the solubility of chiral compounds in LC solvents depends on temperature, as it was discussed, for instance, for dicinnamate isosorbide [18]. Good solubility was obtained for chiral compounds possessing low melting enthalpy [19]. Besides, it has been suggested that in case of the presence of polar fragments in the molecular structure of CCs, the phase instability of LC systems can be observed [20].In this work we discuss characteristics of cholesteric LC systems comprising of new highly chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone as dopants in accordance with the requirements for ChLCDs and consider the effect of rigidity of the molecular structure of the estrone derivatives on the temperature behavior of cholesteric short pitch.The synthetic methods for the preparation of the new chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are shown in Scheme 1.The synthesis of estrone derivatives 8a–c as well as 8d–i consisted of two stages.For the preparation of estrone derivatives 8a–c in the first stage of synthesis estrone was condensed with the veratryl aldehyde in an alkaline medium. The second step consisted of acetylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group at the third position of the obtained and unknown before 16E-veratrylidenestrone (2) under the influence of anhydrides of corresponding acids in pyridine. The products of the reaction are 3-alkanoyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone 8a–c.For the preparation of estrone derivatives 8d–i the sodium salt of estrone underwent alkylation using an excess of the corresponding alkyl iodide in the medium of absolute ethanol. After that the obtained ethers of estrone (3–7) were condensed with the corresponding aldehydes in an alkaline medium. The conditions of the reaction were analogous to those known in literature, for instance, for benzaldehyde [21] or its substituted derivatives [22,23]. The products of the reaction are 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone 8d–i.The structures of the new compounds were proved by IR (Perkin Elmer RX1 FT-IR, in KBr), NMR spectroscopy (Varian Mercury-200 or Varian Mercury-400). Mass spectra were recorded on a Varian 1200L GC–MS instrument, ionization by EI at 70eV. The specific optical rotation, [α]D, was measured at 20°C using a Perkin Elmer-343 polarimeter. Elemental analysis was carried out on an EA 3000 Eurovector elemental analyzer. Melting points were determined on a Kofler hot bench. The progress of reactions and also the purity of the obtained compounds were monitored by TLC on Silufol UV-254 plates with chloroform/acetone (2:1) or (9:1) as an eluent. The synthesized compounds are at least 95% pure according to GC–MS and elemental analysis. Commercially available reagents and solvents were used without further purification.

Both nematics are characterized by the wide temperature range of the mesophase: (−20)–83°C for E63 and (−20)–62°C for LC-1289.The texture analysis of LC systems was performed using a polarizing optical microscope equipped with a heating stage within the accuracy of 0.5°C. The helical pitch, P, was measured using a wedge-like glass sample by the conventional Grandjean–Cano method [1]. HTP values of CCs 8 in nematic LC mixtures were calculated according to Gottarelli and Spada [2] asHTP=1/(PTredCr),where PTredis the helical pitch at the reduced temperature Tred (Tred=0.98Ti, Ti is the temperature of the phase transition from cholesteric (N∗) to isotropic liquid (I)), r is the enantiomeric purity (for all CCs 8,r=1), C is the CC concentration (in mole fractions). The concentration of chiral compounds in nematic LC-1289 was taken 0.01–0.02mol fraction. For practical use HTP values are also expressed in mass fractions.The cholesteric helix handedness (twisting sign) was determined according to Adams–Haas method [26]. For cases when the cholesteric helix handedness was not determined, HTP values are given as absolute values.The selective light reflection spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrometer. The planar texture of LC samples was used; the thickness of the LC layer was 15μm. The P values for short-pitch N∗ systems were determined asP=λmax/n¯,wheren¯is the mean refractive index. The temperature dependences of λmax have been found to be linear for all studied LC systems and characterized by the dλmax/dT parameter (correlation coefficients are 0.95–0.99).Testing of solubility of CCs 8 in LC solvents was performed by the way of repeat recordings of spectra of the selective light reflection of LC systems during the next 3months using commercial cells with ITO surface layers (from Instec, Inc., USA).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
New highly chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are effective dopants for development of bistable cholesteric reflective LC displays. The presented series of steroids is characterized by high helical twisting power in nematics E63 and LC-1289. The introduction of a low concentration of chiral compounds in LC solvents (4.7–7.4mol.%) produces a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure with the selective light reflection in red, green and blue spectral regions. The LC systems comprising 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are characterized by the stability of reflective characteristics with temperature and time. The insignificant temperature dependence of the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection can be attributed to the relatively rigid molecular structure of chiral compounds due to the rigidity of the steroid core as well as a low degree of conformational mobility of chiral compounds in general.
