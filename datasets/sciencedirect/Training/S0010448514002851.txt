@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we present a fully automatic Delaunay based sculpting algorithm for approximating the shape of a finite set of pointsSinR2. The algorithm generates a relaxed Gabriel graph (RGG) that consists of most of the Gabriel edges and a few non-Gabriel edges induced by the Delaunay triangulation. Holes are characterized through a structural pattern called as body-arm formed by the Delaunay triangles in the void regions.RGGis constructed through an iterative removal of Delaunay triangles subjected to circumcenter (of triangle) and topological regularity constraints inO(nlogn)time usingO(n)space.We introduce the notion of directed boundary samples which characterizes the two dimensional objects based on the alignment of their boundaries in the cavities. Theoretically, we justify our algorithm by showing that under given sampling conditions, the boundary ofRGGcaptures the topological properties of objects having directed boundary samples. Unlike many other approaches, our algorithm does not require tuning of any external parameter to approximate the geometric shape of point set and hence human intervention is completely eliminated. Experimental evaluations of the proposed technique are done usingL2error norm measure, which is the symmetric difference between the boundaries of reconstructed shape and the original shape. We demonstrate the efficacy of our automatic shape reconstruction technique by showing several examples and experiments with varying point set densities and distributions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Given a finite set of points,S⊆R2, distributed across a known or unknown object, shape reconstruction deals with the construction of a polygon (could be with holes) that best captures the geometric shape ofS(Fig. 1). The problem finds various applications in computer graphics, computer vision, pattern recognition  [1], Geographical Information System  [2,3], study of physical objects like stars in astronomy  [4], molecular shape description in biology  [5], and target area monitoring in wireless sensor networks  [6].There exist few challenges in approximating the shape of a point set. First, it is unclear what constitutes the best approximation for the geometric shape of a point set mainly due to a lack of precise mathematical definition for its optimal shape. Second, the point set shapes are highly subjective in nature and often depend on a specific application context or other human cognitive factors. As a consequence, the shapes perceived by humans for a majority of point sets vary and reaching a consensus on the optimum shape is an extremely difficult task. The rich variety of shapes available in the nature and the heterogeneity of point sets further weaken a well-defined formulation of the shape approximation problem  [7].Delaunay based shape reconstruction approaches such asα-shape  [8],A-shape  [9] andχ-shape  [10] depend on external parameters to construct the geometric shape of a point set. As a result, a family of shapes is generated for a given point set. For example,α-shape family of a brain point set consists of a set of different but structurally close shapes for different values ofαas demonstrated in Fig. 2. Though it gives the flexibility of choosing the best shape that suits an application, it has few limitations. For instance, choosing the best shape from a set of similar shapes demands a great deal of human involvement which might induce humanly errors thereby affecting the accuracy of the whole system or application. Moreover, since everyone is cognitively different from each other, reaching a consensus on the desired shape by different individuals becomes a challenging task. Considering these facts, it is often desirable to have an automatic algorithm that constructs the geometric shape of a point set.In general, two approaches have been adopted to evaluate shape reconstruction results. In one approach, the results are experimentally evaluated against a known original shape with respect to certain error parameters. Error is estimated as the area of symmetric difference between the original shape and the reconstructed result  [10]. The evaluation of the results are made extensive and authentic by carrying out experiments like varying point density and homogeneity in point distribution. In another approach, algorithms are analyzed theoretically for geometric and topological guarantees on the output shape under some input sampling assumptions  [12]. We use both the approaches for evaluating the proposed shape reconstruction algorithm.
