@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study a firm that makes new products in the first period and collects used products through trade-in, along with new product sale, in the second period. To conduct a convincing analysis, we initially evaluate the problem in a duopoly situation in which one firm (firm A) implements trade-in and the other one (firm B) does not. We subsequently introduce the competitive environment in a two-period planning horizon to identify thresholds that determine the trade-in operations, and then derive the equilibrium decisions of the resulting scenarios. We characterize the optimal production quantities that are associated with parameter b (the sum of used product salvage value and government subsidy) in the Nash equilibrium. Results indicate that adopting trade-in could bring competitive advantage for firm A in terms of market share and profit. If the new product sale is comparatively profitable, then the trade-in firm may forgo some of the collection margin by raising the trade-in rebate and selling additional units to increase new product sale in the second period. Moreover, the total collection quantity does not always increase with government subsidy. We consequently expand the model to the case where both firms compete in trade-in and derive the corresponding decision space of the duopoly firms. Finally, we explore the effect of adopting trade-in on consumer surplus and compare it in the two models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is a hot research topic because of its low carbon property in the past few years (Hashemi, Chen, & Fang, 2014; Hu, Yuan, & Hu, 2011; Krikke, 2011). CLSC is a closed system that extends from raw material purchase to final sale, including product return that spans the entire life cycle of a product. The environmental, legislative, and economic factors encourage people to consider CLSC. The importance of remanufacturing used products has been widely recognized in literature and in practice (Heese, Cattani, Ferrer, Gilland, & Roth, 2005; Savaskan, Bhattacharya, & Van Wassenhove, 2004). Remanufacturing is profitable and environmentally efficient (Atasu, Van Wassenhove, & Sarvary, 2009; Ferguson & Toktay, 2006; Geyer, Van Wassenhove, & Atasu, 2007). However, along with its added benefit and environmental friendliness, CLSC also brings problems to the operation and recovery of a remanufacturing firm, such as internal cannibalization as well as disassembly and collection difficulties (Guide & Li, 2010; Jorjani, Leu, & Scott, 2004).Production planning has been a concern for remanufacturing firms because the used products (otherwise known as cores) collected can be unstable either in quantity or quality. Kenné, Dejax, and Gharbi (2012) address the production planning problem of a single product involving combined manufacturing and remanufacturing operations within a closed-loop reverse logistics network with machines subject to random failures and repairs. Teunter and Flapper (2011) model the uncertainty in core acquisition to determine optimal acquisition decisions by considering multiple quality classes and a multinomial quality distribution. Hong and Yeh (2012) investigate the effect of retailer collection in a CLSC in which the retailer collects end-of-life products and the manufacturer cooperates with a third-party firm to handle used products. Moreover, several researchers have shown interest in used/obsolete product collection.Remanufacturing requires a continuous supply of used products; thus, the method of luring customers to return their used products and the problem of pricing cores become important issues (Liang, Pokharel, & Lim, 2009). Cai, Lai, Li, Li, and Wu (2014) develop a dynamic acquisition pricing and production planning scheme to minimize the total discounted cost over a finite number of time periods by classifying cores into two quality grades. Guide, Teunter, and Van-Wassenhove (2003) investigate the remanufacturing of cellular phones and argue that the prices for used phones of various quality levels should consider remanufacturing requirements because the quality of returned used phones can differ significantly. To ensure the sufficiency of used products prepared for manufacturing, Galbreth and Blackburn (2006) examine the case of a remanufacturer that acquires unsorted used products from third-party brokers. Galbreth and Blackburn demonstrate the existence of an optimal acquisition and sorting policy, and that the policy is independent of production amount when acquisition costs are linear. Wei, Govindan, Li, and Zhao (2015) explore how the manufacturer and the retailer formulate their pricing and collection decisions under symmetric and asymmetric information conditions.As a special mode of collection, trade-in not only takes back used products, but also brings added benefits, such as expansion of the scale of new product sales, increased environmental awareness of consumers, and cultivation of brand loyalty (Desai & Purohit, 1999). A trade-in replacement process involves several steps. First, the consumer brings the used/discarded items to the collector (manufacturer, retailer, or third party logistics). Second, the collector offers a discount or direct subsidy to the consumer when the latter buys new goods. Third, the used product is then disassembled or refurbished. In China, the popularity of trade-in was first driven by the 2009 government subsidy plan (ended in December 2011). The regulation only covers five household appliances, namely, television, refrigerator, air conditioner, washing machine, and computer. Trade-in replacement has extensively spread in various industries, such as cell phone and furniture. In 2014, the Chinese government issued new regulation on the trade-in of used automobiles with government subsidy. By contrast, trade-in practices have received comparatively little attention in literature.Adda and Cooper (2000) evaluate a policy intervention similar to trade-in, in which French provincial authorities provide used product owners a one-shot subsidy to scrap their old cars and buy new ones. They report that forward-looking consumers would shift purchases ahead to take advantage of the discount. Ray, Boyaci, and Aras (2005) develop and analyze a pricing framework for a durable, remanufacturable product. They also study three pricing schemes derived from the choice behavior of individual customers, namely, uniform price for all customers, age-independent price differentiation between new and replacement customers, and age-dependent rebates for replacement customers. Rao (2009) argues that despite cannibalization concerns, a producers profit will inevitably increase from introducing a trade-in program. Rao’s analysis shows that producers in the durable goods markets should consider trade-in programs as a matter of routine. The aforementioned studies primarily model their findings in a monopoly framework. Instead, we attempt to illustrate the effectiveness of using trade-in through another method.In this paper, we investigate the optimal production and trade-in pricing decisions for profit-maximizing firms that sell a durable or remanufacturable product. We initially develop an individual consumer choice framework that models each customers purchasing or return decisions based on the effective price (net of the trade-in value, if any) of the product on hand. We subsequently focus on the decisions of the firms in the presence of duopoly competition both in the new product market and the trade-in market. The potential market consists of a known population of two segments, namely, first-time buyers and replacement buyers. We assume that the replacement customers only consider the trade-in of their existing products, and each consumer can only hold one unit of the product.To develop a better understanding of why firms should be widely encouraged to use trade-in and when to take action, we construct a duopoly model to explore the possible reasons from both the firm and consumer perspectives. We aim to answer the following questions:(1)When engaging in trade-in, can the firm(s) be more profitable compared to the scenario in which no trade-in is considered?What is the optimal production and trade-in pricing strategy of the firm when facing duopoly competition?How does the consumer surplus change with respect to the implementation of trade-in and the appearance of an opponent firm?Our duopoly marketing model helps us address managerial issues that are both analytically and numerically related to optimal pricing/trade-in operations. At the end of the paper, we briefly discuss an extension through which the competitor is allowed to participate in the trade-in activity. The corresponding pricing and production decision space is derived. Our paper would be instructive to provide effective sales planning during the two-period planning across the new product sale and trade-in market.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the description and construction of our model. Section 3 details the duopoly analysis under monopoly trade-in and duopoly trade-in, and then presents the derived optimal pricing strategy. This section also analyzes the effect of implementing trade-in transaction and discusses the profitable intervals of the firm. Section 4 presents an analysis of consumer surplus, together with a numerical study. Section 5 concludes the paper.The model is structured as follows. Consider a duopoly competing in both new product sale and trade-in market within a two-period planning horizon, where time is indexed byk=1,2. In period 1, the firms (firm A and firm B) may sell new durable goods. A continuum consists of heterogeneous consumers indexed by θ, whose willingness to pay is uniformly distributed over set [0, a]. The consumers will buy the new product if and only if its net utility is positive (Chiang et al. 2003), that is,U1n=θ−p1n>0. Without loss of generality, let a potential consumers exist in period 1. To determine the demand, we need to identify the marginal customer who is indifferent between buying and not buying. To make a fair comparison and obtain sharper insights, we assume that the duopoly sells the products with the same quality. Thus, the demand function of first-time buyers in period 1 is given as(1)Q1n=a·Pr(θ−p1n>0)=a∫p1na1adθ=a−p1n.Subscripts 1 and 2 sequentially denote the time period. From Eq. (1), we can obtain the reverse price function asp1n=a−q1nA−q1nB. In period 2, new product sale is continued and trade-in activity is started. At the beginning of period 2, a group of new consumers whose mass is aΔ(Δ > 0) enters the market. The customers who already own the products in period 2 have two options: either to keep the old products bought in period 1 or replace and buy new ones. To allow for quality deterioration over time, let the quality retention index be γ; thus, the used product has utilityθ(1−γ)in period 2. To simplify the analysis, we neglect several assumptions such as the discount factor. We also disregard the remaining lifespan of the product. The potential consumers can be classified into the following three segments:(1) Second-period first-time buyers;(2) First-period buyers who opt to keep the old product; and(3) Replacement consumers.Second-period first-time buyers will buy the new product ifU2n=θ−p2n>0. The demand function is given as(2)Q2n=aΔ·Pr(θ−p2n>0)=∫p2naΔdθ=Δ(a−p2n).Furthermore, the price charged by the firms isp2n=a−(q2nA+q2nB)/Δ. For the consumers who hold used products, the trade-in activity provides them with an opportunity to buy the new products with trade-in value (p2m) and government consumption subsidy (st). The related parameters are described in Table 1. Thus, the replacement occurs ifU2m=θ−p2n+p2m+st>θ(1−γ)>0. The consumer whose valuation θ equals(p2n−p2m−st)/γis indifferent between the two options. The direct income of the firms from implementing trade-in is the salvage value of the used products collected from the replacement consumer. The number of trade-in consumers is given as(3)Q2m=a·Pr(U2m>θ(1−γ))=a∫p2n−p2m−stγa1adθ=a−p2n−p2m−stγ.The trade-in rebate can be solved asp2m=a−(q2nA+q2nB)/Δ−st−(a−Q2m)γ. Two of these parameters, salvage value of the used products (vo) and quality retention index (st), characterize the consumer incentive to perform key trade-in activities. Given that νoand stalways appear simultaneously in the quantity competition among the two firms, we useb=νo+st,(b < 2cn) for simplicity. To perform a tractable analysis, we assume that all of the threshold or critical values related to parameter b are smaller than 2cn. The value of b can be considered the net revenue of the entire CLSC. We select parameter b as the key parameter to describe the strategy space in each scenario that we analyze. The reason is that firms apparently have the largest influence over this parameter through the strategic management of product design. The firms aim to maximize the net present value of their profit. Based on the demand functions derived above, we subsequently define the profit function of firms.In this paper, we consider a two-period planning horizon that has been used extensively in literature related to the issues about durable products and remanufacturing (Bulmus, Zhu, & Teunter, 2014; Desai & Purohit, 1999; Ferguson & Toktay, 2006). The firms choose the prices and quantities that maximize their profit. In period 1, only the new product is offered. The net profit of the firm in period 1 isΠ1i=(p1n−cn)q1ni,i=A,B.In period 2, the firms can benefit from both the trade-in market and the new product sale. The net profit of the firm in period 2 is derived asΠ2i={(p2n−cn)(q2ni+q2mi)+(νo−p2m)q2miifientersthetrade-inmarket,(p2n−cn)q2ni,i=A,BelseAggregating these decisions over the two market segments, we obtain the overall profit function of the firm as(4)Πi=Π1i+Π2i,i=A,B.We subsequently investigate the effect of adopting trade-in on the firms production, pricing, profit, change of market share, and consumer surplus under duopoly competition.To conduct a comparable and convincing analysis, we initially consider the scenario in which the opponent firm keeps away from implementing trade-in. We call this model “model O”. Given that these firms produce the same products, their competition can be depicted as production competition. Without loss of generality, firm B does not join the trade-in market. Firm A sets(p1nA,p2nA,p2mA)to maximize its total profit during the two periods. Mathematically, this approach is equivalent to selecting its best(q1nA,q2nA,q2mA)to maximize the profit as(5)maxΠAq1nA,q2nA,q2mA=(p1n−cn)q1nA+(p2n−cn)q2nA+(p2n−cn+νo−p2m)q2mAsubjecttoQ1n≥q2mAsubjecttoq2mA≥0,q1nA≥0,q2nA≥0subjecttoQ1n=q1nA+q1nB.The first and second terms of Eq. (5) represent the profit obtained from new product sale in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the third term is the sum of the revenue obtained from trade-in, including new product sale and used product collection. The first constraint implies that the number of trade-in consumers cannot exceed the quantity of new products sold in period 1. Meanwhile, all of the decision variables must be non-negative. The profit function of the competitor (firm B) is subsequently written as(6)maxΠBq1nB,q2nB=(p1n−cn)q1nB+Δ(p2n−cn)q2nB.Firm Bs decision problem is to maximize its profit based on its production cost and the opponents (firm A) decisions. Firm A will react according to its cost, salvage value, government subsidy as well as firm Bs decisions. The Hessian matrix of Eqs. (5) and (6) is negative-definite,HA=8γ>0,andHB=4>0; thus, the profit functions are concave. We can derive the optimal decisions of the duopoly firms in Proposition 1.Proposition 1When firm A tends to implement trade-in and firm B does not, three critical values emerge, namely, b1 < b2 < b3, which define the three scenarios that represent the optimal policy:Scenario 1: If the total net income of CLSC satisfiesbA<cn−aγ=b1, then no trade-in occurs, and this case defaults to the classic two-period duopoly quantity competition as follows:q1nA*=q1nB*=a−cn3,q2nA*=q2nB*=Δ(a−cn)3andq2mA*=0;Scenario 2: If the total net income of the CLSC satisfiesb1<bA<aγ+3cn−4cnγ3=b2, then the products sold in period 1 are partially collected by firm A. The optimal production quantities are given asq1nA*=q1nB*=a−cn3,q2nA*=q2nB*=Δ(a−cn)3andq2mA*=aγ+νA+st−cn2γ;Scenario 3: If the total net income of the CLSC satisfiesb2<bA<aγ+a−2cnγ=b3, then firm A takes back all of the products sold by firms A and B in period 1. The best decisions are derived as follows:q1nA*=a+2(st+νo+cnγ)−3cn3+2γ,q1nB*=aγ+a−νo−st−2cnγ3+2γ,q2nA*=q2nB*=Δ(a−cn)3andq2mA*=2a+νo+st+aγ−3cn3+2γ.See Appendix A.In Proposition 1, firm A’s attitude toward production and collection is explored. Proposition 1 indicates that the value of parameter bAis crucial for firm A when deciding the optimal trade-in rebate; that is, if salvage value νoremains unchanged, then the unit government subsidy stplays an important role in deciding the trade-in policy of firm A. Because Q2mis consistently increasing with bAand continuous within the three intervals ([0, b1], [b1, b2] and [b2, b3]), then, we getQ2mO−3>Q2mO−2>Q2mO−1. BecauseQ1nO−3>Q1nO−2=Q1nO−1,Scenario 3 yields the largest new product sales:QtnO−3>QtnO−2>QtnO−1(Qtn=ΣQkn+Q2m,k=1,2). Figs. 1and 2illustrate the behavior, showing how quantities and profit change with parameter bA. (a=780,cn=340,γ=0.65,andΔ=0.8).□IfbA>b3=aγ+a−2cnγ, firm A will monopolize the new product sale in period 1 and the trade-in in period 2, and all of the used products are collected by firm A, thenq1nA*=q2mA*=a+aγ+st+νo−2cn2(1+γ),q1nB*=0,andq2nA*=q2nB*=Δ(a−cn)3,whereq1ni*(i=A,B)denotes the optimal production quantity for firm i.See Appendix A.Corollary 1 implies that threshold value b3 exists, such that, if bA> b3, then firm A will monopolize both period 1 of the new product market and the trade-in market, and firm B will exit the market in period 1. We define this phenomenon as scenario 4 in the rest of this paper. This phenomenon can be explained that firm A has an excessive advantage in competition with firm B when both firms charge the same price in period 1. In other words, the large value of parameter b would take the consumers away from the competitor. This scenario indicates that designing the high value of salvaging the used product or raising government subsidy may be helpful for a firm in an oligarchic competition but may be detrimental for consumers and the environment (i.e., the collection quantity decreases). Furthermore, the optimal prices under this scenario are derived as follows:p1n*=a+aγ−st−νo+2cn2(γ+1),p2m*=2a+4cn+3νoγ−aγ−2cnγ−3stγ−6st−3aγ26(γ+1).Taking the production quantities in Proposition 1 back into Eqs. (1)–(3), we derive the optimal prices charged by the firms in Table 2. Therefore, we raise a meaningful question: Does firm A always benefit directly from the collection activity in the three scenarios? To answer this question, we derive the following interestingfindings:□(1)For scenario 2, whenγ∈(γ˜,1)is satisfied, ifb^<bA<b2is held, then firm A’s direct income from trade-in is positive (νo−p2m>0); ifb1<bA<b^is held, the direct income from trade-in is negative (νo−p2m<0); whenγ∈(0,γ˜)is satisfied, for all b1 < bA< b2, νo< p2m.For scenario 3, whenγ∈(γ˜,1)is satisfied, for all b2 < bA< b3, then firm A’s direct income from trade-in is positive (νo−p2m>0); whenγ∈(0,γ˜)is satisfied, ifb¯<bA<b3is held, νo> p2m, and whenb2<bA<b¯is held, νo< p2m.whereγ˜=12,b^=2a+cn−3aγ3,andb¯=3a+6cn−aγ−5cnγ−3aγ23(γ+3).See Appendix A.Threshold γ evidently exists, which decides whether firm A’s direct revenue from collecting is negative or positive. We subsequently focus on the situation in which firm A monopolizes the market (bA>b3=aγ+a−2cnγ).□WhenbA>b3=aγ+a−2cnγis satisfied, firm A can always benefit directly from the trade-in activity (νo−p2m>0).See Appendix A.Corollaries 2 and 3 suggest that firm A does not always benefit directly from the used product collection. In some conditions, firm A even collects at a loss. However, firm A does not have to be in deficit around the two-period planning horizon. This phenomenon widely exists in practice. For example, firms might sacrifice its revenue in the trade-in market and earn more in selling a new style of products. The loss in collection can be offset by the boom in new product sales. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the phenomenon (wheref1=−(a−cn)/3,f2=(2γ−1)(a−cn)/3,andf3=(3γ+2)(a−cn)/3). f1, f2 and f3 capture the key value of (νo−p2m). In Fig. 3, f1 < 0, f3 > f2 > 0, andb^>b¯. By contrast, in Fig. 4, f1 < f2 < 0, f3 > 0, andb¯>b^. In both figures, the slope coefficient of the curve of (νo−p2m) under full collection scenario is larger than that under the partial collection scenario, which indicates that (νo−p2m) increases more rapidly when b is sufficiently large. Moreover, when the utility of keeping a used product (1−γ) is relatively small (i.e.,γ∈(0,γ˜)), a larger range of b,b∈(b^,b3)exists, in which the value of (νo−p2m) is positive. This result suggests that the potential replacement consumers are more willing to buy through trade-in when the used product deteriorates rapidly. We now discuss the market share.□When adopting trade-in transaction, firm A always takes a larger market coverage compared to firm B.See Appendix A.As depicted in Corollary 2, firm A does not always benefit directly from trade-in, and a larger market share could not induce a larger profit. We subsequently determine the conditions under which trade-in activity brings firm A a larger profit. By substituting the quantities and prices derived above into Eq. (4), we solve the profits of firms under four different scenarios, namely, partial collection, full collection, no collection, and firm A monopoly scenario (see Table 3).□We respectively compare these scenarios with the benchmark scenario (scenario 1) in which firm A earnsΠA−O−1=19(1+Δ)(a−cn)2. Before discussing the changes on firm A’s profit, we compare firm A with firm B in terms of gaining profit to illustrate the competitive advantage of using a trade-in strategy.Proposition 3(I) In scenario 2, firm A keeps making a larger profit than firm B; (II) When scenario 3 occurs, firm A earns more profits than firm B if parameter bA satisfies the following conditions:Condition (i): Ifb→2<0≤b→1, whenbA∈(max(b→1,b2),b3), thenΠA−O−3>ΠB−O−3exits;Condition (ii): If0<b→2<b→1, whenbA∈(b2,max(b→1,b3))∪(max(b→2,b2),b3), thenΠA−O−3>ΠB−O−3exits; otherwise,ΠA−O−3<ΠB−O−3,whereb⇀1,2=−(9a−9cn−12cnγ+10aγ+2aγ2)±Ω∘2γ,Ω∘=(8γ+9)(2γ+3)2(a−cn)2.See Appendix A.Proposition 3 suggests that partial collection is safer than full collection when firm A aims to earn more than firm B. Certainly, if firm A opts to give up trade-in, then it could earn equally. The following results are derived to illustrate the effect of implementing a trade-in policy on firm A.□(I) When scenario 2 occurs, firm A always makes a larger profit compared to the no-collection scenario (scenario 1); (II) In scenario 3, firm A earns a larger profit than in scenario 1 if bA satisfies the following three conditions:Condition (i): Ifb˜2<b˜1≤0, for ∀bA∈ (b2, b3), thenΠA−O−3>ΠA−O−1exists;Condition (ii): Ifb˜2≤0<b˜1, whenb˜1<b3is held, forbA∈(max(b˜1,b2),b3), thenΠA−O−3>ΠA−O−1exits; Ifb˜1≥b3is held, for ∀bA∈ (b2, b3), thenΠA−O−3<ΠA−O−1exits;Condition (iii): If0<b˜2<b˜1,ΠA−O−3>ΠA−O−1holds in the two sub-conditions: (1) whenb2<b˜2is held, forbA∈(b2,max(b3,b˜2));(2) whenb3>b˜1is held, forbA∈(max(b2,b˜1),b3); whenb˜2<b2<b3<b˜1is held, for ∀bA∈ (b2, b3), thenΠA−O−3<ΠA−O−1exists,whereb˜1,2=−9(7a−9cn+8aγ−8cnγ+2aγ2)±Ω18(1+γ),Ω=9(40γ+49)(2γ+3)2(a−cn)2.See Appendix A.Finding (I) indicates that in the partial collection scenario, a larger bAbrings firm A a larger profit compared with scenario 1. From Proposition 1, the same quantity of new product sales ((a−cn)(1+Δ)/3) exists in both scenarios (1 and 2). The additional profit is clearly obtained from trade-in activity. Finding (II) implies that an extremely large parameter bA(in some regions) may be detrimental for firm A. In other words, if government subsidy (st) remains unchanged, increasing salvage value νois harmful for firm A’s profit. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that a large salvage value in period 2 could be associated with a high cost design in period 1, which might decrease the profit in new product sales. Meanwhile, if salvage value νoremains unchanged, then mindlessly increasing government subsidy could also harm firms that implement trade-in. When scenario 4 occurs (bA> b3), we derive a similar finding between bAand firm A’s profit.□When firm A monopolizes the trade-in activity in period 2 and new product sale in period 1, it obtains a larger profit compared to the benchmark scenario if: (i) whenb˘1≤0, for ∀bA∈ (b3, 2cn),ΠA−O−4>ΠA−O−1;(ii) whenb˘1>0, forbA∈(max(b˘1,b3),2cn),ΠA−O−4>ΠA−O−1exists,whereb˘1,2=(36cn−18aγ−18a)±Ω′18,Ω′=144(1+γ)(a−cn)2.The proof of Corollary 4 is similar to the proof of Proposition 3, we choose to omit it.Corollary 4 indicates that if one firm monopolizes the market, then it still should pay considerable attention to its product design to control the resulting salvage value in period 2. Similarly, for ∀bA∈ (b3, 2cn), we obtainΠA−O−4≥ΠB−O−4. In particular,ΠA−O−4>ΠB−O−4always holds if and only ifγ∈(2cna−1,1)(i.e., the roots ofΠA−O−4−ΠB−O−4=0are negative). The preceding analysis primarily discusses firm As production and trade-in pricing problem when firm B does not participate in the trade-in market. To enhance the integrity of the model, we extend the investigation into the case in which both firms have the opportunity to implement trade-in.□When firms A and B appear in the new and trade-in market, to ensure that the analysis is close to reality, we let both firms adopt different salvage values. We call this model “model T”. Firm A performs a similar profit function and demonstrates similar constraints as in model O; thus, we omit the presentation of this decision problem and directly construct the Lagrange function as follows:LA′=(a−q1nA−q1nB−cn)q1nA+q2nA(a−(q2nA+q2nB)/Δ−cn)+(νo+st+(a−q2mA−q2mB)γ−cn)q2mA+λ1(q1nA+q1nB−q2mA)+λ2q2mA+λ3q2nA+λ4q1nA∂LA′∂q1nA=∂LA′∂q2nA=∂LA′∂q2mA=0λ1(q1nA+q1nB−q2mA)=λ2q2mA=λ3q2nA=λ4q1nA=0λ1≥0,λ2≥0,λ3≥0,λ4≥0.Similarly, firm B’s Lagrange function is built as follows:LB′=(a−q1nB−q1nA−cn)q1nB+q2nB(a−(q2nB+q2nA)/Δ−cn)+(νo′+st+(a−q2mB−q2mA)γ−cn)q2mB+μ1(q1nB+q1nA−q2mB)+μ2q2mB+μ3q2nB+μ4q1nB∂LB′∂q1nB=∂LB′∂q2nB=∂LB′∂q2mB=0μ1(q1nA+q1nB−q2mB)=μ2q2mB=μ3q2nB=μ4q1nB=0μ1≥0,μ2≥0,μ3≥0,μ4≥0.These conditions lead to the following proposition that describes the duopolys optimal production policies.Proposition 5The competition space of the duopoly manufacturer is divided by seven linear relationships between bA and bB. The optimal production policy of firms A and B is characterized as follows:(1)If(cn+bA−aγ)/2<bB<min(aγ+2bA−cn,2cn(1−γ)−bA), then both firms will partially collect the total quantity sold in period 1. In particular, whenbA+bB=2cn(1−γ)is held, all of the old products are totally collected by firms A and B.Ifmax(cn−aγ,aγ+2bB−cn)<bA<13aγ−43γcn+cn, then the products sold in period 1 are partially collected by firm A. Firm B exits the trade-in market.Ifmax(aγ−4γcn+3cn3,aγ+aγ2+3bB+2bBγ+γcn−3cnγ)<bA<a+aγ−2γcn, then firm A completely collects the products sold in period 1, whereas firm B does not collect anything.Ifmax(2bA+aγ−cn,cn−aγ)<bB<13aγ−43γcn+cn, then the products sold in period 1 are partially collected by firm B. Firm A exits the trade-in market.Ifmax(aγ+aγ2+γcn+2bAγ+3bA−3cnγ,aγ−4γcn+3cn3)<bB<a+aγ−2γcn, then firm B collects all of the products sold in period 1 and firm A does not collect anything.IfbB<cn−aγandbA<cn−aγis held, firms A and B will exit the trade-in market.See Appendix B.As described in Proposition 5, six scenarios are defined when both firms implement trade-in. Two groups of scenarios are symmetric. A higher value of bBbrings firm B a higher rate of collection. Accordingly, a lower value of bAalso brings firm A a lower collection rate. If b is sufficiently small (b<cn−aγ), then the firms even exit the trade-in market. This outcome is similar to the findings in Proposition 1. Characterizing the structure of the optimal policy is highly complicated for the general asymmetric problem. Hence, we address a special case, that is, both firms have an equal salvage value of used products, (i.e.,νo=νo′). This case will help us derive direct but interesting results.□In this subsection, we consider a model of two symmetric firms to analyze the effect of competition on their optimal trade-in strategy decisions. We narrow the findings in Proposition 3 into the following corollaries:Corollary 5(1) Whenb<cn−aγis held, then both firms will exit the trade-in market; (2) Ifcn−aγ<b<cn(1−γ), then the used products sold in period 1 are partially collected in period 2. In particular, whenb=cn(1−γ)is held, all of the used products are totally collected by firms A and B. Under this scenario, the firms charge the used product asp2m=13(a−st−aγ+2νo).See Appendix B.Corollary 5 states that a lower boundb1=cn−aγexists; if b < b1, then no trade-in occurs. An upper bound,b4=cn−cnγalso exists; ifb=b4,then the firms fully collect the used products. However, trade-in only serves as an efficient means of promoting new product sales in period 2 asvo−p2m<0whencn−aγ<b≤cn(1−γ). Furthermore, compared with model O, we obtain the following findings:□Ifcn−aγ<b≤cn(1−γ)is held, when both firms implement trade-in, then they attract the same quantity of primary consumers throughout the two periods compared with model O. However, a larger number of used products are collected from the consumers. Thus, the changes in profits are given as follows:ΠA−T−2<ΠA−O−2;ΠB−T−2>ΠB−O−2;ΠT−2<ΠO−2.See Appendix B.Corollary 6 suggests that firm B benefits from adopting trade-in, and a larger total profit lies in model O. By contrast, firm A incurs a significant loss in profit because it collects less in model T than in model O (i.e.,aγ+bA−cn3γ<aγ+bA−cn2γ) and a larger trade-in rebate is offered in model T (i.e.,a−st−aγ+2νo3>2a+cn+3νo−3st−3aγ6). A larger portion of used products is collected in model T with same value of parameter b; therefore, the situation in which both firms compete in trade-in is good for the environment. We subsequently raise the third question proposed in Section 1: What is the effect of implementing trade-in on consumer surplus?□Formally, when the total quantity produced is Q, the total consumer utility isU=∫0Q(ϖ−δu)du,where ϖ denotes the potential market size, and δ denotes the elastic coefficient between price and total quantity, ϖ > 0, δ > 0. The expected payment by consumers is(ϖ−δQ)Q. The expected consumer surplus is consequently given byCS=∫0Q(ϖ−δu)du−(ϖ−δQ)Q. Because the consumers in period 1 face a demand function asp1n=a−Q1n,thus, the consumer surplus in period 1 can be expressed asCS1n=∫0Q1n(a−u)du−(a−Q1n)Q1n=12Q1n2.In period 2, the consumers can be categorized into two segments, namely, first-time buyers and trade-in buyers. First-time buyers in period 2 face demand functionp2n=a−(q2nA+q2nB)/Δ. For the trade-in buyers, the actual purchase price they paid for the new products ispt=p2n−st−p2m=(a−Q2m)γ. Consumer surplus in period 2 is given byCS2n+CS2m=12ΔQ2n2+12Q2m2γ. Thus, the total consumer surplus isCS=CS1n+CS2n+CS2m=12(Q1n2+1ΔQ2n2+Q2m2γ).A comparison of the results in Table 4yields the following findings:Proposition 6The relationships of consumer surplus in different scenarios can be described asCSO−1=CST−1<CSO−2<CSO−3<CSO−4, and for the same value of b,CSO−2<CST−2exists.See Appendix B.Proposition 6 states that the more used products are collected, the larger consumer surplus is obtained. In other words, consumer surplus increases with parameter b.CSO−2<CST−2also implies that market competition is good for the consumers. Moreover, Proposition 6 shows that a larger consumer surplus ensues when trade-in occurs. We illustrate the relationship through a numerical example (see Fig. 5).□Fig. 5 shows that the consumer surpluses in different models all increase with parameter b in their corresponding intervals. In addition,CSO−2andCSO−3are continuous on b2. Interestingly, the largest consumer surplus lies in scenario 4 (i.e., firm A monopolizes new product sale in period 1). This result implies that occasionally monopoly may also be good for the consumers. The changes in trade-in rebate (p2m) with salvage value (vo) and government subsidy (st) are depicted in Fig. 6. The optimal trade-in rebate decreases with government subsidy (st) while it increases with salvage value (vo). Thus, reducing the trade-in cost when the government increases subsidy (stwould be helpful for the firm. Subsequently focusing on the changes in the total collection quantity with respect to quality index γ and production cost cnis necessary. Table 5is derived based on solving the first-order conditions on the parameters.Table 5 can be also applied to describe the relationships between the total quantity of new product sales in the two periods and the aforementioned two parameters. A direct understanding on the effect of these two parameters on consumer surplus or firm profit is difficult to obtain; thus, we use numerical examples.where,a=580,cn=340,andΔ=0.8. The corresponding trade-in thresholds are solved in Table 6. We can also find that these thresholds decrease with quality retention index γ.From Table 7, with the same value of b,CST−2is larger thanCSO−2. Moreover, firm A’s profits and consumer surplus in different models all increase when quality retention index γ increases. This phenomenon explains why firms nowadays rapidly update their products.
