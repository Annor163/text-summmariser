@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Our paper presents a dynamic model of entrepreneurial venture financing under uncertainty based on option exercise games between an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist (VC). In particular, we analyze the impact of multi-staged financing and both economic and technological uncertainty on optimal contracting in the context of VC-financing. Our novel approach combines compound option pricing with sequential non-cooperative contracting, allowing us to determine whether renegotiation will improve the probability of coming to an agreement and proceed with the venture. It is shown that both sources of uncertainty positively impact the VC-investor's optimal equity share. Specifically, higher uncertainty leads to a larger stake in the venture, and renegotiation may result in a dramatic shift of control rights in the venture, preventing the venture from failure. Moreover, given ventures with low volatility, situations might occur where the VC-investor loses his first-mover advantage. Based on a comparative-static analysis, new testable hypotheses for further empirical studies are derived from the model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Venture capital (VC) is a significant source of financing for entrepreneurs seeking to implement innovative investment projects as well as for the development of start-up businesses (e.g. Cassar, 2004). For example, the amount of capital invested by VC-investors in start-up companies totaled $87 billion in 2014, over 58% more than the capital invested in 2013.11Cf. Ernst & Young Venture Capital Insights 4Q14.This aggregated value, which is due to only 6.507 VC-financings, is as high as the gross domestic product (GDP) of countries like the Slovak Republic, Ecuador or even the sum of the three Baltic states, indicating the importance of VC-financing and successful venturing for sustainable economic growth on a global scale.Determining how to make successful decisions in VC-projects, however, is still one of the most complex investment problems because of the specific characteristics of these ventures (e.g. Miltersen & Schwartz, 2002). On the one hand, VC-projects imply a sequence of investment decisions that have to be made at certain points in time. At these “milestones” the VC-investor (and respectively the entrepreneur) has to decide whether to further invest in the project or to abandon it. This implied characteristic gives these ventures a specific time pattern (“phase financing”) the economic consequences of which must be adequately captured in the calculus (e.g. Cossin, Leleux, & Saliasi, 2002; Gompers, 1995; Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003, 2004; Sahlman, 1990). On the other hand, the process of VC-financing is influenced by multiple sources of idiosyncratic uncertainties. The activities of an entrepreneur, as well as the investment of the VC-investor, are not only exposed to severe market risks as soon as the developed product is sold, but also to technical uncertainties typical for any venturous process before commercialization (e.g. Davis, Schachermayer, & Tompkins, 2004; Li, 2008; Pennings & Lint, 1997; Wang & Zhou, 2004).Some of the financial literature dealing with the decision-making process in VC-projects pleads for the application of the real option-approach (e.g. Dixit & Pindyck, 1994; Sick, 1995) since VC-activities (almost) exclusively portray future options for the firm involved (e.g. Cossin, Leleux, & Saliasi, 2005; Li, 2008). The scope of the existing real option-based models is, however, limited as those approaches commonly rely on games against nature and do not properly account for the (inter-)actions and managerial flexibilities of the parties involved (e.g. Bergemann, Hege, & Peng, 2008; Berk, Green, & Naik, 2004; Childs & Triantis, 1999; Dixit & Pindyck, 1994; Hsu, 2002; Miltersen & Schwartz, 2002; Pennings & Lint, 1997). The assumption of a “central planner” is not appropriate for VC-projects which typically involve options that can only be exercised if the parties agree on relevant economic parameters, i.e. negotiate about a continuation and financing of stages respectively. In order to better capture these actions and flexibilities some articles explicitly consider contract design problems in dynamic settings and thus analyze non-cooperative bargaining processes in staged investments for an array of different VC-related aspects (e.g. Cornelli & Yosha, 2003; Cuny & Talmor, 2005; Dessi, 2011; Fluck, Garrison, & Myers, 2006; Hellmann, 2002; Neher, 1999; Repullo & Suarez, 2004). While those approaches commonly address the important question of how the surplus generated by the VC-project can be shared between the VC-investor and the entrepreneur, the presumed settings do not allow for the analysis of the specific characteristics of staged investments.This article contributes to the existing branches of research as we provide a sequential decision model for staged VC-projects under uncertainty and in this framework analyze the outcomes of a non-cooperative bargaining process between the VC-investor and the entrepreneur. The starting point of the model is based on the consideration that the vision of a plan focused on diverse "milestones" or "stages" respectively should regularly form the basis for decision-making about the financing of ventures. Correspondingly, it seems to be conducive to consider the sequence of decisions concerning the allocation of VC as a consequence of diversely significant options (flexibilities) that can only be exercised at certain points in time, i.e. require investment decisions of the parties involved at certain stages (cf. Cuny & Talmor, 2005). With regard to these joint decisions, we focus on the optimal funding policies in VC-projects, with particular emphasis on the determinants of both parties’ choice of equity as the investment is exposed to technological and market uncertainty. Closely linked to this area of focus, we investigate the circumstances under which the funding of such a staged project will occur and finally how the surplus generated is shared between the parties involved.Our paper combines multi-staging and joint contracting, which up to this point has been treated independently in the real option-literature. First, it borrows the staged investment structure from Pennings and Sereno (2011). Using a model for N-nested compound options the authors show that the insurance effect caused by staged investment adds considerable value, and that both technological and economic uncertainty increase the option value of staged financing. However, the staged investment project only focuses on a game against nature and reflects only an all equity-financed project. Second, our model is close to Banerjee, Gücbilmez, and Pawlina (2014) who – in line with other contributions including Lambrecht (2004), Shibata and Nishihara (2011), and Lukas, Reuer, and Welling (2012) – develop a real option-based decision-making model for jointly held options. In particular, the authors model a VC-contract between an entrepreneur and a VC-investor where the entrepreneur makes the timing decision while both parties bargain over the optimal sharing of the surplus. It is assumed that the contract can be comprised of either a cash payment, an equity stake or a combination of both. How uncertainty affects the choices of timing and equity share depends on the distribution of bargaining power. Accordingly, should the entrepreneur possess a low degree of bargaining power, an increase in volatility leads to an increase of the VC-investors equity stake and to a pronounced deferral of the investment by the entrepreneur, i.e. the optimal investment threshold increases.Our paper, however, is different from these contributions in several ways. First, we explicitly take multiple stages into account. Consequently, the model can be interpreted as a jointly held compound option as opposed to the classical canonical real option-models by Dixit and Pindyck (1994). Second, we explicitly take technological uncertainty in the first stage into account. Finally, both parties are allowed to veto against financing the next stage, taking into account that renegotiation might serve as a proper incentive mechanism to avoid unilateral abandonment.In Section 2, we provide a detailed outline of the decision structure of our model by characterizing the tasks the entrepreneur must accomplish in each phase, the investments necessary to enter the next phase and the risks the activities of the parties involved are opposed to. Section 3 summarizes the optimal decision-rules for the three phases assuming a non-cooperative bargaining process between the VC-investor and the entrepreneur. In Section 4, we present and discuss in detail the results of a comparative static-analysis focusing on the optimal funding policy in staged projects. In Section 5, we conclude and sketch some potential for future research.The starting point of the model is a temporal structure dividing VC-financing into three phases. The first phase defines the financing of the development process, which ranges from idea to prototype, including market analysis and developing a business- or project-plan. Starting at time t0 the first phase concludes after a specified length of time, T, i.e.t1−t0. We will refer to this phase as the seed phase. If no further obstacles to a product's market diffusion are present, the still preliminary start-up phase begins. Here, the entrepreneur prepares the product, develops a market, sets up organizational structures and production facilities. Again, we assume a fixed start-up phase that takes up the timet2−t1. At t2 the product may be seen as marketable and commercialization may commence. During this commercialization phase distribution and growth financing for market prevalence is performed.For each of the three points in time t0, t1 and t2 an investment payout is accounted for as I0, VC> 0, I1, VC> 0 and I2, VC> 0, respectively. This payout represents the VC-financing of each assigned project phase. Likewise, at these stages the entrepreneur has to invest an amount of I0, E> 0, I1, E> 0 and I2, E> 0. These investments also include the entrepreneur's opportunity costs of managing the project, for example missed salaries. We defineI0:=I0,VC+I0,E,I1:=I1,VC+I1,EandI2:=I2,VC+I2,E. A cancellation of succeeding project phase(s) within the entire process is only possible at these specific points in time. This is in line with Pennings and Lint (1997)22We follow Pennings and Lint (1997) by assuming that in practice R&D resources are, to a large extent, linked to a project for a prespecified period of time. Consequently, we assume no real differences between the management of intangible resources within a firm and a venture in its respective phases.and Bienz and Walz (2010), as well as with the managerial function of VC-investors. Costs (payouts) spent at these points in time are counted as lost. At each specified point in time we assume that the value of the project V(t) is uncertain33As a market-based methodology the real option-approach assumes knowledge of the market value of the underlying which is in some instances problematic (e.g. Mason and Merton, 1985). In order to circumvent this problem, we rely on the “market asset disclaimer” (MAD). In particular, following Copeland et al. (2004), we assume that the present value of the project itself serves as an underlying asset for the option rights.and follows a geometric Brownian motion44Samuelson's (1965) proof shows that the use of a geometric Brownian motion (gBM) is appropriate to model the evolution of the value of a project throughout time. Of course, we could also have used a different continuous stochastic process for the development of the cash-flows, e.g. arithmetic Brownian motion, mean-reverting processes or a gBM with a time-varying noise parameter.:(1)dV(t)=αV(t)dt+σV(t)dB(t),V(t0)=V0>0,wherer∈Rdenotes the risk-free interest rate,δ:=r−α∈Rdenotes the opportunity of waiting,σ∈Rdesignates the variance of dV/V and dB(t) indicates a Wiener increment.55For a traditional interpretation of δ in the case of real options see e.g. McDonald and Siegel (1984).Because all funds provided by the VC-investor, or directly paid by the fund-seeking entrepreneur, are assumed to be sunk and that considerable uncertainty prevails, managerial flexibility becomes important. Thus, we assume that the party deciding whether or not to enter the next phase retains the right but not the obligation to invest. Consequently, providing funds, i.e. I0 for the seed phase at t0, grants the right to receive an option to invest additional funds of size I1 for the start-up phase if the economic environment develops favorable. Here, the funds in the first phase are used to cover costs for brainstorming, prototype development and to make up a business-plan (e.g. Cabral & Dezsö, 2008) while I1 comprises costs related to human capital and any other preparatory measures necessary for market operations. Should the VC-investor and the entrepreneur both decide to finance the start-up phase at t1 they receive an option to enter into the commercialization phase. Entering this third phase requires no further funding. However, it offers the right but not the obligation to finally accept a project with uncertain value in the future. Of course, exercising this last option requires additional funds, i.e. I2, that are used for setting up the production facilities as well as marketing and other commercialization requirements of the final product. In contrast with the first and second phase, the right to introduce the final product to the market does not expire, therefore a decision must be made regarding the optimal time to exercise the last option.We assume that beginning production is the result of a successful seed phase, the success of which, in general, is affected by a different type of uncertainty related to technical issues.66For the sake of simplicity, we use the geometric Brownian motion to model technical uncertainty (see also Pindyck (1993)). Of course, different techniques exist by which technical uncertainty can be considered in real option-models. Exemplary, Pennings and Lint (1997) assume that technical uncertainty can be captured by a compound Poisson process with stochastic amplitude while Koussis et al. (2007) and Martzoukos and Trigeorgis (2002) capture the nature of technological uncertainty by means of dependent control variables stressing the path-dependencies of innovation trajectories. Moreover, Grenadier and Weiss (1997) rely on the modeling technique for bond defaults in order to capture the uncertain arrivals of new innovations.For reasons of simplicity we assume this risk as uncorrelated with the risk of the subsequent stages and we will again model this source of risk by means of a geometric Brownian motion, i.e.(2)dV(t)=αV(t)dt+ΣV(t)dB(t),V(t0)=V0>0,withΣ2=η2+σ2≥σ>0,and η as a measure for technical uncertainty affecting the profitability of the project during the seed phase. All in all these considerations result in the following schedule for the VC-project (see Fig. 1).As alluded to earlier, each decision in the process of VC-financing is contingent on future decisions. The solution of such a sequential optimization problem is based on the principle of recursion (cf. Bellman & Angel, 1972), meaning that determining optimal decisions is solved by starting from the last phase. Thus, when assessing the entire VC-process, the schedule must be worked through in reverse temporal order. Despite this general principle, in an imperfect real world the assumption of a "central agent (planner)" who is able to make optimal decisions seems to be inappropriate. Thus, the fact that the entrepreneur and the VC-investor have to negotiate whether to continue or stop the project must be accounted for. In this regard we assume that the VC-investor claims a share of the value of the investment project, i.e. γVCV with 0 ≤ γVC≤ 1, as a compensation for the capital provided to the entrepreneurial firm, wherebyγE:=1−γVCrepresents the entrepreneur's stake of equity in the new venture. In return, the entrepreneur has the right to decide on the timing of the final investment I2. Furthermore, at all stages when funds have to be provided both parties have to agree to provide their funds, otherwise the project will be abandoned, thereby losing all value for both parties.Beginning the commercialization phase is costless, the only critical decision is whether to bring the product to market or not. Here, the entrepreneur has to optimally time his investment of I2, E.77In this regard it should be noted that granting the VC-investor a veto right at this stage would make no difference as the VC-investor would never use this right. In particular, the VC-investor chooses his equity share γVCoptimally in t0 and thereby automatically guarantees thatγVCV***(1−γVC)−I2,VC>0.Consequently, the entrepreneurial firm will invest in the new project as soon as V(t) hits a certain threshold from below, i.e. V***(γE) that depends on the distribution of equity shares which have been determined by the VC-investor. Proposition 1 summarizes the corresponding optimal decision rule for the entrepreneur:Proposition 1An entrepreneurial firm will invest iff the project value equals or surpasses a certain critical project value threshold V***(γE) derived by(3)V***(γE)=ββ−11γEI2,E,which depends on the equity share1−γclaimed by the VC-investor and whereby(4)β=12−ασ2+(12−ασ2)2+2rσ2.After the VC-investor and the entrepreneur have provided the initial funding, the entrepreneur will start with engineering a prototype and developing a business plan. If he succeeds, both parties again have the option to provide further funding at t1 leading to the following proposition:Proposition 2AA party i ∈ {E, VC} will agree to provide funds of size I1, iat time t1iff the project value equals or surpasses a certain critical project value thresholdVi**(γi)derived by(5)C2,i(Vi**(γi),γi)−I1,i=0,with N (⋅) as the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution:(7)d1(γE)=βln(V***(γE)V(t1))−(r+12σ2β2)(t2−t1)σβt2−t1,(8)d2(γE)=ln(V(t1)V***(γE))+(r−δ+12σ2)(t2−t1)σt2−t1,(9)d3(γE)=ln(V(t1)V***(γE))+(r−δ−12σ2)(t2−t1)σt2−t1,and(10)Ai(γi)=(γiV***(γE)−I2,i)(1V***(γE))β.If V(t1) is less thanVi**(γi), party i would not agree to finance the start-up phase and the whole project would have to be abandoned.In the case that one party i ∈ {E, VC} agrees to provide funds, i.e.V(t1)≥Vi**(γi), while the other partyi¯∈{E,VC}∖{i}does not agree to do so, i.e.V(t1)<Vi¯**(γi¯), the project would have to be abandoned and party i would lose all of its potential profitC2,i(V(t1),γi)−I1,i.Consequently, it would be optimal for party i to voluntarily grant the other partyi¯a higher share in the venture so that partyi¯also agrees to finance the start-up phase. In particular, party i has to increase the other party's shareγi¯at least until the other party breaks even, i.e. until the conditionC2,i¯(V(t1),γi¯)−I1,i¯=0holds. If simultaneouslyC2,i(V(t1),1−γi¯)−I1,i≥0, party i may thus generate some profit. However, ifC2,i(V(t1),1−γi¯)−I1,i<0, increasing the other party's share is not meaningful for party i and the project has to be abandoned. Obviously, a successful redistribution of shares is not possible if both parties do not agree to provide funds, i.e. ifV(t1)<min{VVC**(γVC),VE**(γE)}. In this case, the project definitively has to be abandoned. Furthermore, if both parties agree to provide funds, i.e. ifV(t1)≥max{VVC**(γVC),VE**(γE)}, there is no need for any party to give away any shares in the venture. The existing division of shares remains unchanged.Proposition 2BAfter a possible renegotiation both parties i ∈ {E, VC} will agree to provide funds of size I1, iat time t1iff the project value equals or surpasses a certain critical project value thresholdV¯**(γE)derived by(11)V¯**(γE)={inf{V≥0|∃γ∈[0,γE]:C2,E(V,γ)−I1,E≥0∧C2,VC(V,1−γ)−I1,VC=0}VVC**(1−γE)>VE**(γE)VE**(γE)VVC**(1−γE)=VE**(γE)inf{V≥0|∃γ∈[γE,1]:C2,E(V,γ)−I1,E=0∧C2,VC(V,1−γ)−I1,VC≥0}VVC**(1−γE)<VE**(γE)Otherwise, the whole project has to be abandoned. If the project will be continued, i.e. ifV(t1)≥V¯**(γE), the entrepreneur will hold a share of(12)γ¯E(γE)={γEV(t1)≥max{VVC**(γVC),VE**(γE)}γ˙VVC**(γVC)<V(t1)≤VE**(γE)1−γ¨VE**(γE)<V(t1)≤VVC**(γVC)in the venture, wherebyγ˙∈[γE,1]is solution to the equation(13)C2,E(V(t1),γ˙)−I1,E=0andγ¨∈[0,γE]is solution to the equation(14)C2,VC(V(t1),1−γ¨)−I1,VC=0.Consequently, the VC-investor will hold a share ofγ¯VC(γVC)=1−γ¯E(1−γVC). Finally, after possible renegotiation the overall flexibility of party i associated with the staged financing project is given by(15)C¯2,i(V(t1),γi)={C2,i(V(t1),γ¯i(γi))V(t1)≥V¯**(γE)0V(t1)<V¯**(γE).In the first phase, the VC-investor has to decide on the optimal claimed equity stake in the venture and whether to provide funds of size I0, VCin order to initiate the project managed by the fund-seeking entrepreneur. Likewise, the entrepreneur has to decide if he wants to start the venture, i.e. invest I0, E, given the equity stake claimed by the VC-investor. Let Ci, i ∈ {E, VC} denote the respective value of the option to finance the start-up phase at t1 under technical and economic uncertainty, the decision criterion is summarized by the following proposition:Proposition 3At time t0a VC-investor will claim an equity stake ofγVC*, which is derived by(16)CVC(V0,γVC*(V0))=maxγVC∈[0,1]{{CVC(V0,γVC)CE(V0,1−γVC)−I0,E≥00CE(V0,1−γVC)−I0,E<0},whereby Ci( · ), i ∈ {E, VC} are given by88Here, the maximization is done numerically.(17)Ci(V,γi)=e−r(t1−t0)∫0∞max{0,C¯2,i(x,γi)−I1,i}ψV(V,x,t1−t0)dxwith(18)ψV(y,z,t)=exp(−(ln(yz)−(α−12Σ2)t)22Σ2t)y2Σ2πtas the transition density of the geometric Brownian motion.Proposition 4A VC-investor will only provide funds of size I0, VCat time t0iff the project value equals or surpasses a certain critical project value thresholdV*(γVC*(V0))derived by(19)CVC(V*(γVC*(V0)),γVC*(V0))−I0,VC=0.Following Eq. (16) the VC-investor will only provide funds if the entrepreneur will also invest. Thus, both parties are willing to invest if the project value surpasses the critical threshold V*. Hence, the value of the VC-investor's investment possibility equals(20)FVC(V0)=max{CVC(V0,γVC*(V0))−I0,VC,0},while the value of the entrepreneur's investment possibility can be determined by(21)FE(V0)={CE(V0,1−γVC*(V0))−I0,EFVC(V0)>00FVC(V0)=0.Consequently, the expected share sVC∈ [0, 1] of the VC-investor on the expected total surplus of the project can be determined by(22)sVC=FVC(V0)FVC(V0)+FE(V0)and the expected share sE∈ [0, 1] of the entrepreneur equalssE=1−sVC.This section first discusses the results of a comparative-static analysis. In particular, we are interested in answering three main questions related to the optimal funding policy in staged-financing strategies. First, since the availability of risky funds is typically restricted, we analyze the determinants of the VC-investor's choice of equity in the venturing firm given technological and market uncertainty. Furthermore, we ask under which circumstances the funding, i.e. the initiation of such a staged project, occurs under uncertainty. Finally, we are interested how the surplus generated in the project is shared between the parties involved. Unless noted otherwise, in our analysis we will assume the following values for the parameters under investigation:I0,VC=0.25,I1,VC=1,I2,VC=0.5,I0,E=0.025,I1,E=0.05,I2,E=0.5,r=.05,α=.03,t2−t1=2andt1−t0=1.99The option values derived at each stage are monotonous functions of the underlying variable. Thus, a choice of another set of parameters would not alter the main results.In the following analysis, we will, for a moment, neglect technological uncertainty in the seed phase, i.e.Σ=σ,and focus on answering the first question, i.e. what determines the optimal choice of the VC-investor's equity participation. In general, the choice of equity in the new venture serves two main functions: First, it compensates the VC-investor for providing funds, because when the final product is brought to the market, the VC-investor owns γVCof the entrepreneurial firm value. Second, the equity serves as an “incentive” to motivate the entrepreneur not to delay investment in the commercialization of the project. Here, a higher equity fractionγE=1−γVCassigned to the entrepreneur lowers the optimal investment threshold V*** (see Eq. 3). Consequently, the distinct parameters of the upstream stages, e.g. the size of the funds or the overall level of uncertainty as well as the possible outcome of the bargaining, have an impact on the outcome of the maximization problem.With respect to possible renegotiation, we find that as the project value in t1 becomes less valuable thanVVC**(γVC), the entrepreneur is forced to give up part of his equity share in order to incentivize the VC-investor to provide further funding. As can be seen in Fig. 2, this necessary loss of control rights can be very severe. For example, from an initially agreed share ofγE=0.4to roughly 15 percent after renegotiation ifV(t1)=V¯**. For lower values of V(t1) it is not possible to satisfy both parties with renegotiation, thus the venture will be abandoned at this stage. While a decrease in market uncertainty leads to a less dramatic loss of control rights, the probability of abandoning the venture at t1 increases due to an increase inV¯**.In the following, we focus on the initial bargaining situation at t0. Here the VC-investor will now choose the equity stake that maximizes his flexibility value, i.e. the option valueCVC(…), taking into account that the entrepreneur can reject his offer. As Fig. 3highlights, the VC-investor will opt for a higher equity stakeγVC*the more valuable the entrepreneurial firm becomes. Put differently, the optimal equity stake for the entrepreneur decreases. Likewise, a longer seed phaset1−t0and a longer start-up phaset2−t1, as well as higher stage-specific costs for the VC-investor, i.e. I2, VC, will result in a higher equity stake demanded by the VC-investor. In contrast, higher stage-specific costs for the entrepreneur result in a higher equity stake granted to the entrepreneur by the VC-investor. The results of the effect of economic uncertainty on the optimal choice of the equity stake indicate a monotonic relationship. In particular, as the entrepreneurial firm's value becomes more volatile, the VC-investor will demand a higher stake in the start-up resulting in a decrease ofγE*(see Fig. 4).Against this background, it is interesting to analyze the degree to which uncertainty actually affects project initiation, i.e. the financing decision of the VC-investor. As can be seen from Proposition 4, financing the project occurs if and only if the entrepreneurial firm value V(t0) exceeds a critical threshold V*. While such a situation has to be profitable for both parties, i.e. both parties actively consider investment, it is reasonable to investigate how uncertainty affects their individual decision-making. An increase in uncertainty has two effects for the VC-investor. Firstly, uncertainty raises - as seen before - the optimal equity share which leads to an increase of the option's intrinsic value. Secondly, due to the insurance effect the subsequent option rights cause that the overall option value assigned to his managerial flexibility also increases indicating a general trend that the VC-investor profits from increased uncertainty. For the entrepreneur, however, the impact of an increased cash-flow uncertainty on the overall option value to invest is ambiguous. In particular, the corresponding flexibility value increases with uncertainty while the corresponding intrinsic value decreases due to the lower equity share offered by the VC-investor. Given these results, we cannot deduce a general statement about which force prevails.Fig. 5depicts the critical threshold as a function of the underlying assets' economic uncertainty σ. The results show that for the given parameter values a negative relationship prevails. Hence, an increase in uncertainty lowers the optimal funding threshold. This indicates that financing the new venture will become more and more attractive.Now that we have analyzed the impact of market uncertainty on the financing and creation of new ventures, we next consider how technological uncertainty affects V* andγE*. First, technological uncertainty lowers the optimal funding threshold, i.e. the funding of the overall venture at t0 becomes more valuable (see Fig. 5). Second, we observe a negative relationship between technological uncertainty and the optimal equity stake granted to the entrepreneur (see Fig. 4). However, these effects diminish as market uncertainty increases.As an intermediate result for further empirical studies our model generates the following hypotheses:Hypothesis 1The VC-investor will demand a higher equity stake in the new venture the more the entrepreneurial firm value is affected by market uncertainty.Hypothesis 2The VC-investor will demand a higher equity stake in the new venture the more the entrepreneurial firm value is affected by technological uncertainty.Both hypotheses are derived from the outcome that increased uncertainty implies a more valuable venture project due to the insurance effect the different milestones provide. Hence, should the VC-investor hold the bargaining power he can opt for a higher equity share knowing that enough is left to also stimulate investment by the entrepreneur.Finally, we analyze how the new venture's expected surplus is shared among the VC-investor and the entrepreneur. Obviously, the game is a dynamic version of the ultimatum game in which the VC-investor acts as the proposer by offering an optimal equity share while the entrepreneur responds to this offer by choosing an optimal timing threshold. Following, among others, Lukas and Welling (2012), we would expect that the VC-investor has a first-mover advantage, i.e. he always gets more from the expected surplus than the entrepreneur. Moreover, the first-mover advantage becomes more distinct the more volatile the underlying asset is. This effect results from the fact that if the entrepreneur would rather wait, he implicitly shifts part of his bargaining power back to the VC-investor. In particular, a strong propensity to defer project initiation will increase the overall expected surplus to be shared, increasing the VC-investor's overall flexibility value because he profits from waiting for valuable new information. However, our findings only confirm the latter effect, i.e. the higher the uncertainty, the higher the VC-investor's expected share on the surplus. There are, however, two surprising results. First, acting as a proposer does not necessarily lead to a first-mover advantage. As Fig. 6depicts, in absence of technological uncertainty the surplus generated for the VC-investor drops below 50 percent in the interval σ ∈ [0, 0.15] indicating that the entrepreneur receives a bigger portion from the surplus generated compared to the VC-investor. Consequently, in such a setting no first-mover advantage prevails. This result can primarily be explained by the specific structure of the game. While the classical ultimatum game assumes a direct response following an initial offer, the specific funding structure of VC-projects calls for several timely delays. In particular, the entrepreneur initially reports the set of needed capital funds to start the business as well as the risk/return-profile of the underlying cash-flows from the business. Based on this information the VC-investor proposes a stake in the venture that he finds optimal in exchange for funding the project. While the optimal choice of the equity stake proposed by the VC-investor is not affected by the size of I0, VC(see Proposition 3), the initial funds provided to play the game serve as some kind of "entry costs" which are completely sunk. Consequently, these sunk costs lead to the loss of the VC-investor's first-mover advantage. Should, however, the new venture's firm value become excessively volatile, this "uncertainty effect" increases the flexibility value compensating for the expected surplus losses incurred when entering the game. Given this scenario, the first-mover advantage becomes more pronounced as uncertainty increases. Secondly, the results indicate that technological uncertainty increases the overall surplus assigned to the VC-investor. Interestingly, the effect of market uncertainty on the VC-investor's surplus might become ambiguous. In particular, in presence of technological uncertainty an increase in uncertainty provokes a decrease of the expected surplus assigned to the VC-investor should the value of the new venture firm be less volatile (see Fig. 6).In contrast, if the market volatility of V(t) is high, an increase in σ leads to a higher expected surplus sVCfor the VC-investor as was alluded to earlier. A necessary condition for this ambiguous effect is that in t0 the overall flexibility value of the entrepreneur's option to invest increases faster with market volatility while its intrinsic value decreases with market volatility due to the lower share γEin the venture. As can be seen in Fig. 4, γEis indeed less sensitive to changes in market uncertainty given technological uncertainty and low values of σ. To sum up our main findings, the following two hypotheses can be used to promote future empirical research:Hypothesis 3High funds provided by the venture capitalist in the seed phase might lead to a loss of first-mover advantage of the VC-investor should the new venture's cash-flows be less volatile.Hypothesis 4The surplus assigned to the VC-investor is positively affected by technological uncertainty, i.e. the higher technological uncertainty becomes, the greater the VC-investor's surplus.
