@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A cooperative game consists of a set of players and a characteristic function determining the maximal gain or minimal cost that every subset of players can achieve when they decide to cooperate, regardless of the actions that the other players take. The relationships of closeness among the players should modify the bargaining among them and therefore their payoffs. The first models that have studied this closeness used a priori unions or undirected graphs. In the a priori union model a partition of the big coalition is supposed. Each element of the partition represents a group of players with the same interests. The groups negotiate among them to form the grand coalition and later, inside each one, players bargain among them. Now we propose to use proximity relations to represent leveled closeness of the interests among the players and extending the a priori unions model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cooperative game theory studies situations where a set of agents (players) bargain for a fair allocation of a common profit resulting from their collaboration, namely a vector with the payoff of each player as coordinates (a payoff vector). In order to establish this allocation a number is known for each subset (coalition) of players representing the profit obtained by them and the mapping that assigns these numbers is named the characteristic function of the game. The Shapley value, Shapley (1953), is one of the point solutions for cooperative games mostly used and studied. It is a function obtaining a payoff vector for each game based in a set of reasonable conditions (axioms) which allow us to decide whether this value is or not the best solution for the problem. Several variations of the Shapley value have been proposed for situations where some additional information about the agents is known. Aumann and Dreze (1974) introduced coalition structures. A coalition structure is a partition of the set of players representing the different coalitions obtained at the end of game. Hence there should be no side payment between these final coalitions. This way has been improved by Myerson (1977) considering communication structures. A communication structure is a graph representing the bilateral cooperation possibilities among the agents. In this case the final coalition structure is the set of connected components in the graph but we can also use the information given by the graph about the internal structure of these coalitions. Owen (1977) proposed a different model from that of Aumann and Dreze based in a different interpretation of the coalition structures. He considered that the coalition structure is a partition of the set of players in a priori unions based in the relations among the agents. But these unions are not considered as a final structure but as a starting point for further negotiations. Thus, as in the original Shapley model, the grand coalition is the final coalition structure. This paper focuses on the Owen variation. So, a coalition of players forms a union if they have the same (or close) interests in the game. Owen obtained a Shapley-type solution (the Owen value) taking into account this information to get a fair allocation of the profit of the grand coalition. Later Casajus (2007) proposed a modification of the Owen model in the Myerson sense. That is, we have an a priori union structure and we know how these unions are formed by means of a connected graph in each group. This graph explains the relation of closeness existing among their players. But closeness is usually a leveled property. For instance, political groups can be organized in a priori ideological unions. Considering equal every ideological closeness between two political parties is actually a simplification of the situation. Aubin (1981), Butnariu (1980) and Mares (2001) introduced fuzzy sets to describe leveled participation of the players in the coalitions (fuzzy coalitions) or fuzziness in the worth of the coalitions given by the characteristic function (fuzzy payoffs). The Choquet integral, Choquet (1953), is a powerful tool from the decision theory which is a way of measuring the expected utility of an uncertain event. Tsurumi, Tanino, and Inuiguchi (2001) used the Choquet integral for fuzzy sets in order to define a Shapley-type solution of a family of games with fuzzy coalitions. Jiménez-Losada, Fernández, Ordóñez, and Grabisch (2010)Jiménez-Losada, Fernández, and Ordóñez (2013); Gallego, Fernández, Jiménez-Losada, and Ordóñez (2014) and Gallardo, Jiménez, Jiménez-Losada, and Lebrón (2014) proposed to use fuzzy structures as an additional information for a cooperative game. Particularly, they considered a fuzzy graph to study fuzzy communication structures in the Myerson way. Meng, Zhang, and Cheng (2012) analyzed games on fuzzy coalitions with a priori unions.Now, we propose a more realistic version of the Owen situation. Following Owen (1977) and Casajus (2007) we consider a fuzzy graph where the fuzzy set of links defines the objective bilateral closeness of interests among the players. This structure is actually a known fuzzy binary relation called proximity relation. This fuzzy relation also establishes unions among the agents but these are not disjoint and each union is represented by a communication structure, thus players are asymmetric in them. While Meng et al. (2012) considered fuzzy coalitions but common a priori unions, we will take usual games but leveled closeness. Preliminaries introduce the needed aspects from cooperative games, a priori unions, communication structures and fuzzy sets to understand the paper. Section 3 analyzes the value introduced by Casajus (2007) in a different way, obtaining an axiomatization comparable to the one of the Owen value. In Section 4 we introduce several ways to reduce a proximity relation which are used later. Section 5 defines an Owen-type value for proximity situations, the prox-Owen value and finally in Section 6 we propose an axiomatization of the new value with reasonable axioms in this context.A cooperative game with transferable utility, a game since now, is a pair (N, v) where N is a finite set of elements andv:2N→Ris a mapping satisfyingv(∅)=0. The elements of N are named players, the subsets of N are said coalitions and v is the characteristic function of the game. We denote as G the set of games. If (N, v) ∈ G and S ⊆ N then(S,v)=(S,vS)∈Gis a new game where vSis the restriction of the characteristic function v to 2S. An example of a game is the unanimity game (N, uT), with T ⊆ N and T ≠ ∅, defined asuT(S)=1if T ⊆ S anduT(S)=0otherwise. If we fix N, the family {uT: T ⊆ N} is a basis of the games over N, that is for every (N, v) there are coefficients cTsuch that(1)v=∑{T⊆N:T≠∅}cTuT.An allocation rule is a function ψ over G which determines for each (N, v) a vectorψ(N,v)∈RNinterpreted as a payoff vector. The Shapley value is an allocation rule defined for every (N, v) ∈ G and i ∈ N as(2)ϕi(N,v)=∑{S⊂N:i∉S}(|N|−|S|−1)!|S|!|N|![v(S∪{i})−v(S)].This allocation rule satisfies efficiency, that is∑i∈Nϕi(N,v)=v(N). The Shapley value is also linear namely if (N, v1), (N, v2) ∈ G anda,b∈Rthenϕ(N,av1+bv2)=aϕ(N,v1)+bϕ(N,v2).A null player i ∈ N for a game (N, v) satisfiesv(S∪{i})=v(S)for all S ⊆ N∖{i}. The Shapley value satisfies the null player axiom i.e. if i is a null player for (N, v) thenϕi(N,v)=0. It is said that i, j ∈ N are substitutable players in a game (N, v) ifv(S∪{i})=v(S∪{j})for all S ⊆ N∖{i, j}. The equal treatment axiom says that if i, j ∈ N are substitutable players in (N, v) thenϕi(N,v)=ϕj(N,v). It is known that the Shapley value is the only allocation rule over G satisfying efficiency, linearity, null player and equal treatment. Moreover these axioms are not redundant.A game with a priori unions is a triple (N, v, P) where (N, v) ∈ G andP={N1,…,Nm}is a partition of N. Players in Nkfor each k have similar interests in the game and they use the union in the bargaining to get a fair payoff. The set of games with a priori unions is denoted as GU.The Owen value ω is an allocation rule over GU. It is supposed that players are interested in the grand coalition N but considering the a priori unions as bargaining elements. Let (N, v, P) ∈ GU withP={N1,…,Nm}. The quotient game (M, vP) with set of playersM={1,…,m}is defined as(3)vP(Q)=v(⋃q∈QNq),∀Q⊆M.Let k ∈ M. For each S ⊂ Nkthe partition PSof N∖(Nk∖S) is to replace Nkwith S. We define (Nk, vk) asvk(S)=ϕk(M,vPS),∀S⊆Nk.Finally we solve the game in every group using also the Shapley value. So, for each i ∈ N if k(i) is such that i ∈ Nk(i) then the Owen value is(4)ωi(N,v,P)=ϕi(Nk(i),vk(i)).The Owen value satisfies efficiency, linearity and null player (the same definitions in GU than in G). It also satisfies equal treatment in a union, namely if i, j ∈ Nkfor k ∈ M are substitutable in (N, v) thenωi(N,v,P)=ωj(N,v,P). Moreover ω satisfies a similar condition with the unions, the coalitional symmetry: if k1, k2 ∈ M satisfy thatv(Nk1∪⋃q∈QNq)=v(Nk2∪⋃q∈QNq)for every Q ⊆ M∖{k1, k2} then∑i∈Nk1ωi(N,v,P)=∑j∈Nk2ωj(N,v,P).Owen (1977) showed that ω is the only allocation rule over GU satisfying efficiency, linearity, null player, equal treatment in each union and coalitional symmetry.11Owen (1977) used symmetry in each union instead of equal treatment in each union, but both axioms are equivalent in a context with efficiency, linearity and null player.LetLN={{i,j}:i,j∈Nandi≠j}be the set of unordered pairs of elements in a finite set N. We will useij={i,j}from now on. A communication structure for N is a graph (N, L) where the set of vertices is N and the set of edges L ⊆ LN is the set of feasible communications among them. Hence we identify a communication structure for N with the set of links L. A game with communication structure is a triple (N, v, L) where (N, v) ∈ G and L is a communication structure for N. A cooperative game (N, v) can be identified with the game with communication structure (N, v, LN). The family of games with communication structure is denoted as GC. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC be a game with communication structure. A coalition S ⊆ N whose vertices are connected by the links in L is called connected. The maximal connected coalitions correspond to the sets of vertices of the connected components of the graph (N, L) and they are denoted as N/L. This family N/L is actually a partition of N. If S ⊆ N is a coalition thenLS={ij∈L:i,j∈S}and (S, v, LS) ∈ GC represents the restriction to S of the game and the communication structure. We useS/L=S/LS. Following Myerson (1977), in a communication structure the final coalition structure is formed by the connected components of the graph, and they cannot get beneficial collaborations among them.The Myerson value is an allocation rule for games with communication structure. Given (N, v, L) ∈ GC Myerson defines a new game (N, v/L) ∈ G incorporating the information of the communication structure,(5)v/L(S)=∑T∈S/Lv(T)∀S⊆N.The Myerson value is defined as(6)μ(N,v,L)=ϕ(N,v/L).The Myerson value is efficient by components, namely∑i∈Sμi(N,v,L)=v(S)for each S ∈ N/L but it is not efficient. Moreover, this allocation rule satisfies decomposability in the sense thatμi(N,v,L)=μi(S,v,LS)for all S ∈ N/L and i ∈ S. This value also satisfies the fairness axiom, i.e. for each ij ∈ L we have:μi(N,v,L)−μi(N,v,L∖{ij})=μj(N,v,L)−μj(N,v,L∖{ij}).The Myerson value is the only allocation rule satisfying efficiency by components and fairness.We will use ∨, ∧ for the operators maximum and minimum in hereafter.A fuzzy set of a finite set K is a function τ: K → [0, 1]. The support of τ issupp(τ)={i∈K:τ(i)≠0}. The image of τ is the ordered setim(τ)={λ1<⋯<λp}={λ∈(0,1]:∃i∈K,τ(i)=λ}.Two fuzzy sets τ, τ′ are comonotone if for all i, j ∈ K it holds(τ(i)−τ(j))(τ′(i)−τ′(j))≥0.Comonotony is a transitive property. For each t ∈ (0, 1] the t-cut of τ is(7)[τ]t={i∈K:τ(i)≥t}.The Choquet integral was introduced by Choquet (1953) for capacities and it was extended for all the set functions in Schmeidler (1986) and De Waegenaere and Wakker (2001). Givenf:2K→Rand τ a fuzzy set over K, the (signed) Choquet integral of τ with respect to f is(8)∫τdf=∑k=1p(λk−λk−1)f([τ]λk),whereim(τ)={λ1<⋯<λp}andλ0=0. The following properties of the Choquet integral are known:(C1)∫eSdf=f(S),for all S ⊆ K, andeS(i)=1if i ∈ S andeS(i)=0otherwise.∫tτdf=t∫τdf,for all t ∈ [0, 1].∫τd(a1f1+a2f2)=a1∫τdf1+a2∫τdf2,whena1,a2∈R.∫(τ+τ′)df=∫τdf+∫τ′df,whenτ+τ′≤eKand τ, τ′ are comonotone.∫τdf=A⋁i∈Nτ(i)iff([τ]t)=Afor all t ∈ im(τ).A bilateral fuzzy relation, see Mordeson and Nair (2000), over K is a function ρ: K × K → [0, 1] satisfying the condition ρ(i, j) ≤ ρ(i, i)∧ρ(j, j). A proximity relation over K, is a fuzzy relation ρ satisfying: (Reflexivity)ρ(i,i)=1for all i ∈ K, and (Symmetry)ρ(i,j)=ρ(j,i)for all i, j ∈ K. Similarity relations are particular fuzzy versions of equivalence relations. A similarity relation over K is a proximity relation ρ satisfying besides: (Transitivity) ρ(i, j) ≥ ρ(i, k)∧ρ(k, j) for all i, j, k ∈ K.In the Owen model players are organized in a priori unions but there is not information about the inner structure of these unions. Casajus (2007) proposed another allocation rule for games with communication structure following the sense of the Owen value that we name here the Myerson-Owen value. Given a game with communication structure (N, v, L) ∈ GC we consider the partition of N by its connected components N/L. Therefore N/L is a set of a priori unions for the players in N but the links in L establish how these unions are formed. We use again the quotient game (3) with the partitionN/L={N1,…,Nm}and now for all k ∈ M withM={1,…,m}the game (Nk, vk),(9)vk(S)=ϕk(M,v(N/L)S),∀S⊆Nk.Definition 1Casajus, 2007The Myerson–Owen value is an allocation rule over GC defined for each (N, v, L) withN/L={N1,…,Nm}and i ∈ N asξi(N,v,L)=μi(Nk(i),vk(i),LNk(i)),where k(i) is such that i ∈ Nk(i).The Myerson–Owen value satisfies the following coincidences.(a)If (N, v, L) ∈ GC satisfies that N is connected by L thenξ(N,v,L)=μ(N,v,L).If (N, v, L) ∈ GC satisfies thatLS=LSfor all S ∈ N/L then we identify (N, v, L) with (N, v, N/L) ∈ GU andξ(N,v,L)=ω(N,v,N/L).If (N, v, L) ∈ GC withL=LNthenξ(N,v,L)=ϕ(N,v).Casajus (2007) obtained an axiomatization of the Myerson–Owen value. Now we provide a new characterization of this value with the purpose of defining all the axioms from the data (the game and the graph) and obtaining a better comparison with the Owen value. Consider the following axioms for ψ an allocation rule over GC.Linearity.For all games (N, v), (N, v′) ∈ G,α,β∈Rand L ⊆ LN,ψ(N,αv+βv′,L)=αψ(N,v,L)+βψ(N,v′,L).Efficiency.For all (N, v, L) ∈ GC it holds∑i∈Nψi(N,v,L)=v(N).Observe that now a null player can obtain profit due to his position in the graph inside a component if this position is essential for other players to cooperate. But if all the players in the component are null then it is impossible to get profits despite the strategic position inside the union of each player. A coalition S ⊆ N is a null coalition in (N, v) ∈ G if each i ∈ S is a null player for (N, v).Null component.Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC and let S ∈ N/L be a null coalition. Thenψi(N,v,L)=0for all i ∈ S.Two coalitions S, T ⊆ N withS∩T=∅are substitutable22The concept of substitutable coalitions is slightly different to the concept given in Owen (1977). Our concept implies the other but it is independent of the unions.in a game (N, v) ifv(R∪S)=v(R∪T)for all R ⊆ N∖(S ∪ T). We can suppose that two substitutable components obtain the same total payoff in the sense of the coalitional symmetry (Section 2.2) because the internal structure in each union is independent of the bargaining among them.Substitutable components.Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC. If S, T ∈ N/L are substitutable in (N, v) then∑i∈Sψi(N,v,L)=∑j∈Tψj(N,v,L).Now the equal treatment property for players depends on the structure in each component because they are asymmetric. The Myerson fairness axiom cannot be used to explain this asymmetry because the deletion of a link can cause a change in the number of components (unions) and then in the bargaining among them. So, we use the modified fairness proposed by Casajus (2007). This axiom can be seen as a balance among unilateral disconnection threats. The difference of payoffs for breaking up unilaterally a link, placing the players disconnected by this fact out of the game, is the same for both players in the link. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC and ij ∈ L. If S ∈ N/L with i, j ∈ S and Si∈ N/(L∖{ij}) with i ∈ Si(in the same way Sj) thenNiji=(N∖S)∪Si(in the same wayNijj).Modified fairness.Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC and ij ∈ L, it holdsψi(N,v,L)−ψi(Niji,v,LNiji∖{ij})=ψj(N,v,ρ)−ψj(Nijj,v,LNijj∖{ij}).We prove in the next theorem that the Myerson–Owen value is the only one satisfying all these axioms.33Casajus (2007) proved that the Myerson–Owen value satisfies efficiency and modified fairness but we replicate the proofs because they are used in the remark just after the theorem.Theorem 1The Myerson–Owen value is the only allocation rule for games with communication structure satisfying the following axioms: efficiency, linearity, null component, substitutable components and modified fairness.We will test that each one of the axioms is satisfied by the Myerson–Owen value. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC,N/L={N1,…,Nm}andM={1,…,m}. The quotient game for every k ∈ M satisfiesv(N/L)Nk=vN/L.Efficiency. Using that the Myerson value is efficient by components (Section 2.3) and the Shapley value is efficient (Section 2.1) we get∑i∈Nξi(N,v,L)=∑i∈Nμi(Nk(i),vk(i),LNk(i))=∑k=1m∑i∈Nkμi(Nk,vk,LNk)=∑k=1mvk(Nk)=∑k=1mϕk(M,v(N/L)Nk)=∑k=1mϕk(M,vN/L)=vN/L(M)=v(N).Linearity. Suppose now another game with the same communication structure, (N, v′, L), and two numbersa,b∈R. As the Shapley value is a linear function (Section 2.1), for each k ∈ M we have for all S ⊆ Nkby (9)(av+bv′)k(S)=ϕk(M,(av+bv′)(N/L)S)=avk(S)+bvk′(S)because(av+bv′)(N/L)S=av(N/L)S+bv′(N/L)Sfrom (3). Since the graphLNkis the same for both games then(av+bv′)k/LNk=avk/LNk+bvk′/LNkfrom (5). Using the linearity of the Shapley value again and (6)ξi(N,av+bv′,L)=ϕi(Nk(i),(av+bv′)k(i)/LNk(i))=aξi(N,v,L)+bξi(N,v′,L).Null component. Suppose N1 ∈ N/L is a null coalition for the game (N, v). If Q ⊆ M with 1 ∉ Q then we useNQ=⋃q∈QNq. For eachT={i1,…,ip}⊆N1we have thati1,…,ipare null players for the game and by (3)v(N/L)T(Q∪{1})−v(N/L)T(Q)=v(NQ∪T)−v(NQ)=∑l=2p[v(NQ∪{i1,…,il})−v(NQ∪{i1,…,il−1})]+[v(NQ∪{i1})−v(NQ)]=0.Hence 1 is a null player in(M,v(N/L)T). As the Shapley value satisfies the null player axiom (see Section 2.1) we getϕ1(M,v(N/L)T)=0. So using (9),v1(T)=0for all T ⊆ N1. But ifv1=0,thenv1/LN1=0in N1 from (5). For all i ∈ N1 we have from (6)ξi(N,v,L)=μi(N1,0,LN1)=ϕi(S,0)=0.Substitutable components. Let N1, N2 ∈ N/L be two substitutable coalitions in (N, v). For each Q ⊆ M we denoteNQ=⋃q∈QNqagain. We test that 1, 2 are substitutable players for (M, vN/L). Let Q ⊆ M∖{1, 2},vN/L(Q∪{1})=v(NQ∪N1)=v(NQ∪N2)=vN/L(Q∪{2}),because N1, N2 are substitutable in (N, v). Since the Shapley value satisfies equal treatment (see Section 2.1)v1(N1)=ϕ1(M,vN/L)=ϕ2(M,vN/L)=v2(N2).The Myerson value is efficient by components (8) so∑i∈N1ξi(N,v,L)=∑i∈N1μi(N1,v1,LN1)=v1(N1)=v2(N2)=∑j∈N2μj(N2,v2,LN2)=∑j∈N2ξj(N,v,L).Modified fairness. Let ij ∈ L and suppose i, j ∈ N1. We haveNiji/(LNiji∖{ij})={(N1)i,N2,…,Nm}.Although the quotient game depends on the graph, we getv1LNiji∖{ij}=v1inNiji. Now we use two properties of the Myerson value: the decomposability and the fairness (Section 2.3),ξi(N,v,L)−ξi(Niji,v1,LNiji∖{ij})=μi(N1,v1,LN1)−μi((N1)i,v1,L(N1)i)=μi(N1,v1,LN1)−μi(N1,v1,LN1∖{ij})=μj(N1,v1,LN1)−μj(N1,v1,LN1∖{ij})=ξj(N,v,L)−ξj(Nijj,v1,LNijj∖{ij})Suppose ψ, ψ′ different values over GC satisfying the five axioms. We take the smallest N and L such that ψ ≠ ψ′. Hence there is a characteristic function v with ψ(N, v, L) ≠ ψ′(N, v, L). Linearity and (1) imply that there exists uTwith T ⊆ N such thatψ(N,uT,L)≠ψ′(N,uT,L).The family N/L is a partition of N. We setMT={S∈N/L:S∩T≠∅}. If S ∉ MTthen all the players in S are null players for the unanimity game (N, uT). The null group property says that for all i ∈ Sψi(N,uT,L)=ψi′(N,uT,L)=0.If S ∈ MTwith |S| > 1 then for each i ∈ S there is j ∈ S∖{i} with ij ∈ L. Taking into account the minimal election of N and L and the modified fairnessψi(N,uT,L)−ψj(N,uT,L)=ψi(Niji,uT,LNiji∖{ij})−ψj(Nijj,uT,LNijj∖{ij})=ψi′(Niji,uT,LNiji∖{ij})−ψj′(Nijj,uT,LNijj∖{ij})=ψi′(N,uT,L)−ψj′(N,uT,L).Thereforeψi(N,uT,L)−ψi′(N,uT,L)=ψj(N,uT,L)−ψj′(N,uT,L). Since LSis connected there existsB∈Rwithψi(N,uT,L)−ψi′(N,uT,L)=Bfor all i ∈ S. If S, S′ ∈ MTthenS∩S′=∅anduT(S∪R)=0=uT(S′∪R)for all R ⊆ N∖(S ∪ S′). Hence S and S′ are substitutable for (N, uT). The substitutable components axiom implies that there existA,A′∈Rsuch that for all S ∈ MT∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,L)=Aand∑i∈Sψi′(N,uT,L)=A′.Now we apply efficiency using thatuT(N)=1,∑i∈Nψi(N,uT,L)=|MT|A=1=|MT|A′=∑i∈Nψi′(N,uT,L).ThusA=A′and∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,L)=∑i∈Sψi′(N,uT,L)∀S∈MT.For each S ∈ MTwe will use the above equality. IfS={i}thenψi(N,uT,L)=ψi′(N,uT,L).Otherwise we obtain0=∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,L)−ψi′(N,uT,L)=|S|B,thusB=0andψi(N,uT,L)=ψi′(N,uT,L)for all i ∈ Nk. Hence we get the contradictionψi(N,uT,L)=ψi′(N,uT,L)for all i ∈ S ∈ MT.□Now we deal with the logical independence of the axioms. We need to find five allocation rules over GC different to the Myerson–Owen value satisfying four axioms of our set but not the other one. The Owen value,ψ(N,v,L)=ω(N,v,N/L),satisfies all our axioms except modified fairness. As we say in Section 2.1 the Shapley value is the only one satisfying efficiency, linearity, null player and equal treatment. Furthermore these axioms are independent and then there exist four allocation rules for G,(ϵp)p=14,such that ϵpsatisfies all the Shapley value’s axioms except the axiom p in the above order.44ϵi1(N,v)=0for all i ∈ N satisfies linearity, null player and equal treatment but not efficiency. LetNv={i∈N:iisnotanullplayerin(N,v)},ϵi2(N,v)=v(N)|Nv|if i ∈ Nvandϵi2(N,v)=0otherwise satisfies efficiency, null player and equal treatment but not linearity.ϵi3(N,v)=v(N)|N|for all i ∈ N satisfies efficiency, linearity and equal treatment but not null player. Given (N, v) ∈ G let (N∖1, v/1) the game defined asv/1(S)=v(S∪1)for each S ⊂ N∖1 (v/1(∅)=0),ϵi4(N,v)=ϕi(N∖1,v/1)for every i ∈ N∖1 andϵ14(N,v)=0satisfies efficiency, linearity and null player but not equal treatment.We define an allocation rule ψϵ over GC for each allocation rule ϵ over G in the following way. Let (N, v, L) ∈ GC,N/L={N1,…,Nm}andM={1,…,m}. We take the game(Nk,vkϵ)given byvkϵ(S)=ϵ(M,v(N/L)S),∀S⊆Nk.So, we considerψiϵ(N,v,L)=μi(Nk(i),vk(i)ϵ,LNk(i))∀i∈N.Of course the Myerson–Owen value is one of this kind of allocation rules,ξ=ψϕ. IfL=LNthenψϵ(N,v,L)=ϵ(N,v). Following the proof of the above theorem we conclude the next equivalences:(a)ψϵ always satisfies modified fairness.ϵ satisfies efficiency if and only if ψϵ does.ϵ satisfies linearity if and only if ψϵ does.ϵ satisfies null player if and only if ψϵ satisfies null component.ϵ satisfies equal treatment if and only if ψϵ satisfies substitutable components.Hence we takeψϵpwithp=1,2,3,4to finish the reasoning.A proximity relation ρ over N can be seen as a fuzzy set ρ overLN¯=LN∪{ii:i∈N}whereρ(ij)=ρ(i,j),taking into account symmetry. Therefore we can calculate t-cuts and Choquet integrals of proximity relations. But not all the fuzzy sets ρ overLN¯are proximity relations because we needρ(ii)=1for each i ∈ N. Proximity relations form the family of the fuzzy sets overLN¯which t-cuts contain {ii: i ∈ N} for all t ∈ (0, 1].We say that a proximity relation ρ is crisp ifim(ρ)={1}. Communication structures are identified with the family of the crisp proximity relations. Each communication structure L ⊆ LN is identified with the crisp proximity relationρLsuch thatρL(i,j)=1ifi=jor ij ∈ L, andρL(i,j)=0otherwise. On the other hand, if ρ is a crisp proximity relation then we take the communication structureLρ={ij∈LN:ρ(i,j)=1,i≠j}. Particularly the t-cuts of a proximity relation are communication structures. A priori union structures are identified with crisp similarity relations.We can only consider set functions over LN for Choquet integrals of proximity relations. Eachf:2LN→Ris identified with another set function overLN¯,denoted with the same letter f, given byf(A)=f(A∩LN)for allA⊆LN¯,and then we use the Choquet integral of a proximity relation with respect to the first f as the one with respect to the second f.In this section we introduce several ways of reducing a proximity relation, the set of elements affected or the set of levels of the image. We also show several properties of the proximity relations related with the Choquet integral.Definition 2Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. If S ⊆ N then the proximity relation restricted to S is ρS, a new proximity relation over S withρS(i,j)=ρ(i,j)for all i, j ∈ S.Obviously, for each S ⊆ N we have|im(ρS)|≤|im(ρ)|.Now we see a relation with the Choquet integral of the restriction.Proposition 2Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. Iff:2LN→Ris such that there is S ⊆ N withf(L)=f(LS)for all L ⊆ LN then∫ρdf=∫ρSdf|LS.Consider S ⊆ N and ρ a proximity relation . For all t ∈ (0, 1] we have([ρ]t)S=[ρS]t. Letf:2LN→Rwithf(L)=f(LS)for all L ⊆ LN. Ifim(ρ)={λ1,…,λp}thenim(ρS)={λ1′,…,λp′′}⊆im(ρ). For eachq′∈{1,…,p′}andq∈{1,…,p}withλq′′≤λq<λq′+1′we obtain[ρS]λq=[ρS]λq′′. So,∫ρdf=∑q=1p(λq−λq−1)f([ρ]λq)=∑q=1p(λq−λq−1)f(([ρ]λq)S)=∑q=1p(λq−λq−1)f([ρS]λq)=∑q=1p′(λq′−λq−1′)f([ρS]λq′)=∫ρSdf|LS.□Now we define a scaling of a proximity relation which considers insignificant the levels out of an interval.Definition 3Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. If a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b thenρabis the interval scaling of ρ, a new proximity relation over N defined asρab(i,j)={1,ifρ(i,j)≥bρ(i,j)−ab−a,ifρ(i,j)∈(a,b)0,ifρ(i,j)≤a.Observe that it holds|im(ρab)|≤|im(ρ)|and particularlyρ01=ρ. The interval scaling of a proximity relation and the original proximity relation are comonotone as fuzzy sets.Proposition 3Let ρ be a proximity relation over N and a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b. The interval scalingρaband ρ are comonotone.We prove thatρab,ρare comonotone as fuzzy sets overLN¯. Letij,kl∈LN¯. We suppose without loss of generality ρ(i, j) ≥ ρ(k, l). If ρ(i, j) ≥ b thenρab(i,j)=1≥ρab(k,l). If ρ(k, l) ≤ a thenρab(k,l)=0≤ρab(i,j). Otherwise, a < ρ(k, l) ≤ ρ(i, j) ≤ b and we get:ρ(i,j)−ab−a≥ρ(k,l)−ab−a.□The above proposition implies the next result for the Choquet integral.Proposition 4Let ρ be a proximity relation over N anda1,…,ar∈[0,1]with a1 < ⋅⋅⋅ < ar. It holds for allf:2LN→Rthat∫ρdf=∑p=1r+1(ap−ap−1)∫ρap−1apdf,witha0=0andar+1=1.Suppose ρ a proximity relation and consider numbers a1 < ⋅⋅⋅ < arin [0, 1],a0=0andar+1=1. Remember that comonotony is a transitive property. Hence, as(ap−ap−1)≥0for everyp∈{1,…,r+1},Proposition 3 implies that(ap−ap−1)ρap−1apand(aq−aq−1)ρaq−1aqare comonotone for allp,q∈{1,…,r+1}.We also prove thatρ=∑p=1r+1(ap−ap−1)ρap−1ap.Letij∈LN¯. We suppose ρ(i, j) ≠ 0 because otherwiseρap−1ap(i,j)=0for all p . In that case there existsq∈{1,…,r+1}withρ(i,j)∈(aq−1,aq]. For each p < q we haveρap−1ap(i,j)=1and for each p > q we getρap−1ap(i,j)=0. Ifp=q,ρaq−1aq(i,j)=ρ(i,j)−aq−1aq−aq−1.So, we obtain∑p=1r+1(ap−ap−1)ρap−1ap(i,j)=∑p=1q−1(ap−ap−1)+(ρ(i,j)−aq−1)=ρ(i,j).Finally we use properties (C4) and (C2) of the Choquet integral to get for any f∫ρdf=∫∑p=1r+1(ap−ap−1)ρap−1apdf=∑p=1r+1(ap−ap−1)∫ρap−1apdf.□Now we define a scaling of a proximity relation where the insignificant levels are those within the interval.Definition 4Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. Let a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b and a ≠ 0 or b ≠ 1. The dual interval scaling of ρ is a new proximity relation over N given byρ¯ab(i,j)={ρ(i,j)+a−b1+a−b,ifρ(i,j)≥ba1+a−b,ifρ(i,j)∈(a,b)ρ(i,j)1+a−b,ifρ(i,j)≤a.Ifa=0andb=1then the dual interval scaling is not well defined. As we will see later this case appears in our results without real influence, but in some step of the proof of Theorem 7 we need it. So, we defineρ¯01(i,j)={1,ifρ(i,j)=10,otherwise.This definition is motivated by the next reasoning: ifa=0and b ∈ (0, 1) thenρ¯0b(i,j)=ρ(i,j)−b1−bif ρ(i, j) ≥ b andρ¯0b(i,j)=0otherwise. We can see our definition as the limit of this option when b tends to 1.55There exists another different option to define the dual interval scalingρ¯01. If we study what happens when (a, b) tends to (0,1) the limit does not exist, and actually we can take any proximity relation asρ¯01(i,j)=1ifρ(i,j)=1,ρ¯01(i,j)=Kif ρ(i, j) ∈ (a, b) andρ¯01(i,j)=0ifρ(i,j)=0.Observe that it also holds|im(ρ¯ab)|≤|im(ρ)|. Next result about the Choquet integral is obtained from Proposition 4.Proposition 5Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. For every pair of numbers a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b and for every set functionf:2LN→Rit holds∫ρdf=(b−a)∫ρabdf+(1+a−b)∫ρ¯abdf.Consider ρ a proximity relation and numbers a, b ∈ [0, 1] with a < b. Ifa=0andb=1we have a trivial equality. Otherwise, Proposition 4 says∫ρdf=a∫ρ0adf+(b−a)∫ρabdf+(1−b)∫ρb1df.Since comonotony is a transitive property we get thataρ0a,(1−b)ρb1are comonotone using Proposition 3. Therefore (C2) and (C4) imply∫ρdf=(b−a)∫ρabdf+∫[aρ0a+(1−b)ρb1]df.Now we prove the next equality of fuzzy sets(1+a−b)ρ¯ab=aρ0a+(1−b)ρb1.Suppose i, j ∈ N. If ρ(i, j) ≤ a thenaρ0a(i,j)+(1−b)ρb1(i,j)=aρ(i,j)a=ρ(i,j).If ρ(i, j) ≥ b thenaρ0a(i,j)+(1−b)ρb1(i,j)=a+(1−b)ρ(i,j)−b1−b=ρ(i,j)+a−b.Finally, if ρ(i, j) ∈ (a, b) thenaρ0a(i,j)+(1−b)ρb1(i,j)=a.We finish the proof using (C2) again.□Owen (1977) considered that the players in a game are organized in a priori unions (see Section 2.2) depending on their common interests. Now we suppose that it is possible to measure the closeness of the ideas of the players. In this order we are going to think of a proximity function describing the closeness among them. Let (N, v) ∈ G. If ρ is a proximity relation over N then ρ(i, j) represents the closeness level between players i, j ∈ N.Definition 5A game with a proximity relation among the players is a triple (N, v, ρ) such that (N, v) ∈ G is a game and ρ is a proximity relation over N. The set of the games with a proximity relation among the players is denoted as GP.If we take a crisp proximity relation then we obtain a game over a communication structure in the sense of Casajus (2007), namely it is a set of a priori unions with a communication structure in each union. Particularly, if we consider a similarity relation, transitivity means here that if the measure of the facets of closeness between players i, k is ρ(i, k) and the one between players k, j is ρ(k, j) then i, j can assume at least (in the worst case) ρ(i, k)∧ρ(k, j) level of closeness. Games with crisp similarity relations are games with a priori unions. Next we see an example of a game with a proximity relation that is not any of these particular cases.ExampleSuppose a set of five agents interested in making use of a land. They decide to cooperate getting the maximum feasible profit. Players 1, 2 are relatives, players 2, 3 are owners, players 1, 4, 5 are workers, 1, 2, 5 have been working together for a long time, and 1, 5 are beer friends. The characteristic function in millions of euros is:v(S)=10(|S|−1)if 2 ∈ S but 3 ∉ S,v(S)=16(|S|−1)if 3 ∈ S but 2 ∉ S,v(S)=48(|S|−2)if 2, 3 ∈ S, andv(S)=0otherwise. We can define the relationship among the players as the following proximity relation considering all the relations with same importance:ρ(i,i)=1for all i,ρ(1,5)=0.6,ρ(1,2)=0.4,ρ(1,4)=ρ(2,3)=ρ(2,5)=ρ(4,5)=0.2andρ(i,j)=0otherwise. We represent the situation by a fuzzy graph in Fig. 1, a graph with weighted edges.Jiménez-Losada et al. (2010) introduced games on fuzzy communication structures using fuzzy graphs. In Jiménez-Losada et al. (2013) we proposed several Myerson values for these situations. Obviously a proximity relation is a particular kind of fuzzy graph, but our interpretation is different from the fuzzy communication structures. Now we extend the Owen model in a fuzzy way. We can see a proximity relation as a communication structure by levels of the players. Let (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP. For each t ∈ (0, 1] we suppose that a set of players form an a priori union with communication structure if they are connected at least at level t and this set is maximal.Fig. 2 shows the different groups formed at each level t ∈ (0, 1] in the above example. Every group has a specific communication structure which determines how the union is formed. The reader can see for instance that if our demand to form a group is to connect them with level at leastt=0.3then {1, 2, 5} is a union. But in this group the position of player 1 is not the same as in the others.Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. We define the set function for every player i ∈ N given as(10)ξi(N,v)(L)=ξi(N,v,L)∀L⊆LN,where ξ is the Myerson–Owen value (Definition 1). Now we introduce the solution proposed in the paper for games with a proximity relation among the players.The prox-Owen value is the allocation rule over the games with a proximity relation among the players defined for all (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP and i ∈ N asηi(N,v,ρ)=∫ρdξi(N,v).Using the expression of the Choquet integral (8) we get the following equality. Ifim(ρ)={λ1<⋯<λm}andλ0=0then(11)η(N,v,ρ)=∑k=1m(λk−λk−1)ξ(N,v,[ρ]λk).This formula shows the prox-Owen value as a sequence of Myerson–Owen values of the corresponding cuts by closeness intervals.Suppose the game of our example in Fig. 1. Depending on the assumed information we obtain the following solutions. If we omit the relationships among the players the Shapley value isϕ(N,v)=(20.333,37,46,20.333,20.333). If we consider only the communication structure L in Fig. 1 without the numbers on the links we apply the Myerson–Owen value of the game (which coincides with the Myerson value because the graph is connected),ξ(N,v,L)=(20.4,50.9,36.733,15.566,20.4). Finally we calculate the prox-Owen value. We have to consider the different graphs in Fig. 2 to determine the Choquet integral. So, for each playeri∈N={1,2,3,4,5}η(N,v,ρ)=(0.2−0)ξ(N,v)([ρ]0.2)+(0.4−0.2)ξ(N,v)([ρ]0.4)+(0.6−0.4)ξ(N,v)([ρ]0.6)+(1−0.6)ξ(N,v)([ρ]1)=(21.38,38.346,45.613,19.38,19.28).In a communication structure L ⊆ LN the set of coalitions which determines the a priori unions among the players are the connected components, the family N/L. In a proximity relation this role is played by the groups as we define now.Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. A coalition S ⊆ N is a t-group for ρ with t ∈ (0, 1] if S ∈ N/[ρ]t. The family of groups of ρ is the setN/ρ=⋃t∈(0,1]N/[ρ]t.A group in a proximity relation is a coalition which can be considered as an a priori union with communication structure when we establish a minimum relation level. If ρ is a crisp proximity relation (a communication structure) then S ∈ N/ρ if and only if S is a connected component in the graph.Definition 8Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. CoalitionsS1,…,Sr⊆Nare leveled groups if there is a number t ∈ (0, 1] such thatS1,…,Srare t-groups.For each set of leveled groupsS1,…,Sr(r ≥ 1) we denote(12)tS1...Sr=⋀{t∈(0,1]:S1,…,Sr∈N/[ρ]t}(13)tS1...Sr=⋁{t∈(0,1]:S1,…,Sr∈N/[ρ]t}.Observe that numbertS1...Sris a maximum but numbertS1...Sris an infimum. Moreover0≤tS1...Sr<tS1...Sr≤1.Obviously, we can say then that groupsS1,…,Sr∈N/[ρ]tfor allt∈(tS1,…,Sr,tS1,…,Sr]. If ρ is a crisp proximity relation thentS1,…,Sr=0andtS1,…,Sr=1for every set of components.Proposition 6Let ρ be a proximity relation over N. If S, T ∈ N/ρ are groups with S ∩ T ≠ ∅ then S ⊆ T or T ⊆ S. Particularly, if S, T are leveled groups thenS∩T=∅.Suppose S, T ∈ N/ρ with ρ proximity relation. If they are leveled then there exists t ∈ (0, 1] with S, T ∈ N/[ρ]t, thusS∩T=∅. IftS=tTthen they are leveled groups. Hence we consider tS> tT. There is a number t > tSsuch that S ∈ N/[ρ]tand T is union of components in N/[ρ]t, therefore orS∩T=∅or S is one of these components.□We propose an axiomatization for the prox-Owen value inspired by the axioms of the Owen value and the Myerson–Owen value (Sections 2.2 and 3).Let ψ be an allocation rule over GP, namely a function which obtains a vectorψ(N,v,ρ)∈RNfor each game with proximity relation (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP. Consider the following axioms.Efficiency.For all (N, v, ρ) it holds∑i∈Nψi(N,v,ρ)=v(N).Linearity.For all games (N, v), (N, v′) ∈ G,α,β∈Rand ρ proximity relation over N,ψ(N,αv+βv′,ρ)=αψ(N,v,ρ)+βψ(N,v′,ρ).Players in a null coalition do not obtain profit when the coalition is considered as a union or a partition of unions, but they can get profits as a coalition inside a bigger union depending on their position in the structure of this union. Therefore we can take these levels t ∈ (tS, 1] as insignificant and rescale. The next axiom extends the null component property.Null group.Let (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP and S ∈ N/ρ a group which is null for the game (N, v) thenψi(N,v,ρ)=tSψi(N,v,ρ0tS)∀i∈S.In order to extend the substitutable components axiom we can suppose that between the levels in which both of the groups are unions the total payoff for each group is the same, namely using (12) and (13)(14)∑i∈Sψi(N,v,ρtSTtST)=∑j∈Tψj(N,v,ρtSTtST).But we can get a similar condition (but not equivalent) using the next axiom which is also an extension of the substitutable components property.66Observe that, by Proposition 5, our prox-Owen value satisfies the substitutable leveled groups axiom if and only if it holds (14).Substitutable leveled groups.Let (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP. If S, T ∈ N/ρ are leveled groups and they are substitutable in (N, v) then∑i∈Sψi(N,v,ρ)−(1+tST−tST)ψi(N,v,ρ¯tSTtST)=∑j∈Tψj(N,v,ρ)−(1+tST−tST)ψj(N,v,ρ¯tSTtST).The proximity relationρ¯tSTtSTrepresents the scaling of ρ out of (tST, tST). We suppose that the payments for groups S, T, subtracting the part in which they are no substitutable, i.e. outside the interval (tST, tST), are the same.We extend the modified fairness axiom to a fuzzy situation. In this case, we take into account the mere reduction of the relation between two players. So we have to consider that this reduction of level only concerns to the interval between the reduced level and the original one. Let ρ be a proximity relation over a set of players N withim(ρ)={λ1<⋯<λm}andλ0=0. Consider i, j ∈ N two different players withρ(i,j)=λk>0. The numberρ*(i,j)=λk−1satisfies that for all t ∈ (ρ*(i, j), ρ(i, j)] the setNiji(orNijj) in the communication structure [ρ]tis the same. We denote also asNiji(orNijj) this common set for ρ. Now modified fuzzy fairness says that modified fairness holds if we reduce by t the level of a link ij for the payoffs in(ρ(i,j)−t,ρ(i,j)],adding those payoffs obtained out of this interval.Modified fuzzy fairness.Let (N, v, ρ) ∈ GP and i, j ∈ N with ρ(i, j) > 0, for eacht∈(0,ρ(i,j)−ρ*(i,j)]it holdsψi(N,v,ρ)−ψj(N,v,ρ)=(1−t)[ψi(N,v,ρ¯ρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))−ψj(N,v,ρ¯ρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))]+t[ψi(Niji,v,(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Niji)−ψj(Nijj,v,(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Nijj)].The next theorem proves that the prox-Owen value is the only allocation rule satisfying all these axioms.Theorem 7The prox-Owen value η is the only allocation rule over GP satisfying the following axioms: efficiency, null group, substitutable leveled groups, modified fuzzy fairness and linearity.We will test each one of the axioms.Efficiency. The Myerson–Owen value satisfies efficiency as we saw in Theorem 1. Hence,(∑i∈Nξi(N,v))(L)=∑i∈Nξi(N,v,L)=v(N)for all (N, v, L) ∈ GC. Now, applying the properties of the Choquet integral (C3), (C5) and also⋁ij∈LN¯ρ(i,j)=1∑i∈Nηi(N,v,ρ)=∑i∈N∫ρdξi(N,v)=∫ρd∑i∈Nξi(N,v)=v(N).Linearity. Suppose now another game with the same communication structure, (N, v′, L), and two numbersa,b∈R. As the Myerson–Owen value verifies linearity (Theorem 1) then (C3) impliesηi(N,av+bv′,ρ)=∫ρdξi(N,av+bv′)=a∫ρdξi(N,v)+b∫ρdξi(N,v′)=aηi(N,v,ρ)+bηi(N,v′,ρ).Null group. Let S be a null coalition for (N, v). We consider ρ a proximity relation over N with S ∈ N/ρ and i ∈ S. We have for the number tS(12) that for all r > tSthere exists a partition{S1,…,Sm}of S such thatS1,…,Sm∈N/[ρ]r. Obviously, these coalitions are also null coalitions and thenξi(N,v)([ρ]r)=0for all i ∈ S since the Myerson–Owen satisfies the null component property (Theorem 1). IftS=0thenηi(N,v,ρ)=0. Otherwise, by Proposition 5 we getηi(N,v,ρ)=tSηi(N,v,ρ0tS)+(1−tS)∫ρtS1dξi(N,v).Ift∈im(ρtS1)thenr=tS+t(1−tS)>tSsatisfies that ρ(i, j) ≥ r if and only ifρtS1(i,j)≥t. Hence,[ρtS1]t=[ρ]randξi(N,v)([ρtS1]t)=0for all t. By (C5) we have∫ρts1dξi(N,v)=0.Substitutable leveled groups. Let S, T ⊆ N be two substitutable coalitions in a game (N, v). Consider now ρ a proximity relation over N with S, T ∈ N/ρ leveled groups. We take numbers tST(12) and tST(13). Applying Proposition 5 for any player i ∈ N,ηi(N,v,ρ)=(1+tST−tST)ηi(N,v,ρ¯tSTtST)+(tST−tST)∫ρtSTtSTdξi(N,v).So, for groups S and T we have by (C3)∑i∈Sηi(N,v,ρ)−(1+tST−tST)ηi(N,v,ρ¯tSTtST)=(tST−tST)∫ρtSTtSTd∑i∈Sξi(N,v)∑j∈Tηj(N,v,ρ)−(1+tST−tST)ηj(N,v,ρ¯tSTtST)=(tST−tST)∫ρtSTtSTd∑j∈Tξj(N,v).Ift∈im(ρtSTtST)then we taketST<r=tST+t(tST−tST)≤tSTwhich satisfies[ρtSTtST]t=[ρ]r. So, as S, T ∈ N/[ρ]rfor all r ∈ (tST, tST] then we obtain from the substitutable components axiom of the Myerson–Owen value (Theorem 1)[∑i∈Sξi(N,v)]([ρtSTtST]t)=[∑j∈Tξj(N,v)]([ρtSTtST]t).Hence,(tST−tST)∫ρtSTtSTd∑i∈Sξi(N,v)=(tST−tST)∫ρtSTtSTd∑j∈Tξj(N,v).Modified fuzzy fairness. Let i, j ∈ N. We consider ρ proximity relation with ρ(i, j) > 0 andt∈(0,ρ(i,j)−ρ*(i,j)]. Using Proposition 5 for numbersρ(i,j)−t,ρ(i,j)and (C3)ηi(N,v,ρ)−ηj(N,v,ρ)=∫ρd[ξi(N,v)−ξj(N,v)]=(1−t)∫ρ¯ρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)d[ξi(N,v)−ξj(N,v)]+t∫ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)d[ξi(N,v)−ξj(N,v)]=(1−t)[ηi(N,v,ρ¯ρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))−ηj(N,v,ρ¯ρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))]+t∫ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)d[ξi(N,v)−ξj(N,v)].For eachx∈im(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))there existsr=ρ(i,j)−t(1−x)withr∈(ρ(i,j)−t,ρ(i,j)]such that[ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)]x=[ρ]r. Since r ≤ ρ(i, j) then ij ∈ [ρ]r, thus the modified fairness of the Myerson–Owen value (Theorem 1) impliesξi(N,v)([ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)]x)−ξj(N,v)([ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)]x)=ξi(Niji,v)(([ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)]x)Niji)−ξj(Nijj,v)(([ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)]x)Nijj).Hence, we obtain by (C3) and Proposition 2∫ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j)d[ξi(N,v)−ξj(N,v)]=∫(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Nijidξi(Niji,v)|Niji−∫(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Nijjdξj(Nijj,v)|Nijj=ηi(Niji,v,(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Niji)−ηj(Nijj,v,(ρρ(i,j)−tρ(i,j))Nijj)Suppose now ψ, ψ′ different values over GP satisfying the five axioms. We prove the uniqueness by induction on the cardinality of the image of ρ.Let|im(ρ)|=1. Of courseim(ρ)={1}and ρ is a crisp proximity relation. Hence in this case we obtain the uniqueness for the family of communication structures of the Myerson–Owen value (Theorem 1). We suppose that there is only one value for all the games with a proximity relation ρ with |im(ρ)| < d, d > 1.Consider now a proximity relation ρ over N with|im(ρ)|=d. If ψ ≠ ψ′ linearity implies that there exists a unanimity game uTsatisfying ψ(N, uT, ρ) ≠ ψ′(N, uT, ρ). The family N/[ρ]1 is a partition of N. We setMT={S∈N/[ρ]1:S∩T≠∅}.If S ∉ MTthen S is a null group for (N, uT). We apply the null group property, iftS=0thenψi(N,uT,ρ)=0=ψi′(N,uT,ρ). Otherwise, as 0 < tS< 1 then tS∈ im(ρ)∖{1} but for all i, j ∈ N withρ(i.j)=tSit holdsρ0tS(i,j)=1. Hence|im(ρ0tS)|≤|im(ρ)|−1<d. The null group property implies now that for all i ∈ S,ψi(N,uT,ρ)=tSψi(N,uT,ρ0tS)=tSψi′(N,uT,ρ0tS)=ψi′(N,uT,ρ).Let S, S′ ∈ MT. We have several cases depending on the numberstSS′,tSS′. IftSS′=0andtSS′=1then|im(ρ¯01)|=1<d. IftSS′>0andtSS′=1thentSS′∈im(ρ)∖{1}but for all i, j ∈ N withρ(i,j)=tSS′it holdsρ¯tSS′1(i,j)=1,therefore|im(ρ¯tSS′1)|≤|im(ρ)|−1<d. IftSS′=0andtSS′<1thentSS′∈im(ρ)∖{1}but for all i, j ∈ N withρ(i,j)=tSS′it holdsρ¯0tSS′(i,j)=0,therefore|im(ρ¯0tSS′)|≤|im(ρ)|−1<d. Otherwise0<tSS′<tSS′<1,thentSS′,tSS′∈im(ρ)but for all i, j withρ(i,j)=tSS′and for all i′, j′ withρ(i′,j′)=tSS′it holdsρ¯tSS′tSS′(i,j)=ρ¯tSS′tSS′(i′,j′),therefore|im(ρ¯tSS′tSS′)|≤|im(ρ)|−1<d. So, applying the substitutable leveled groups axiom∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,ρ)−∑j∈S′ψj(N,uT,ρ)=(1+tSS′−tSS′)[∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,ρ¯tSS′tSS′)−∑j∈S′ψj(N,uT,ρ¯tSS′tSS′)]=(1+tSS′−tSS′)[∑i∈Sψi′(N,uT,ρ¯tSS′tSS′)−∑j∈S′ψj′(N,uT,ρ¯tSS′tSS′)]=∑i∈Sψi′(N,uT,ρ)−∑j∈S′ψj′(N,uT,ρ).Hence∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψi′(N,uT,ρ)=∑j∈S′ψj(N,uT,ρ)−ψj′(N,uT,ρ)=H.Now, using efficiency∑i∈Nψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψi′(N,uT,ρ)=∑S∈MT∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψi′(N,uT,ρ)=|MT|H=0.ThusH=0. IfS={i}with i ∈ T thenψi(N,uT,ρ)=ψi′(N,uT,ρ). Suppose then S ∈ MTwith i, j ∈ S two different players withρ(i,j)=1. We apply modified fuzzy fairness to this link reducing by1−ρ*(i,j),ψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψj(N,uT,ρ)=ρ*(i,j)[ψi(N,uT,ρ¯ρ*(i,j)1)−ψj(N,uT,ρ¯ρ*(i,j)1)]+(1−ρ*(i,j))×[ψi(Niji,uT,(ρρ*(i,j)1)Niji)−ψj(Nijj,uT,(ρρ*(i,j)1)Nijj)]=ψi′(N,uT,ρ)−ψj′(N,uT,ρ),where the last equality holds since ρ*(i, j) ∈ im(ρ)∖{1} and then|im(ρ¯ρ*(i,j)1)|,|im((ρρ*(i,j)1)Niji)|≤|im(ρ)|−1<d.Coalition S is connected in [ρ]1, this fact implies that we can connect two players in S by{i=i0,i1,…,ip=j}⊆Swithρ(iq,iq−1)=1for allq=1,…,p. Thus, we haveψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψi′(N,uT,ρ)=Kfor all i ∈ S and0=∑i∈Sψi(N,uT,ρ)−ψi′(N,uT,ρ)=|S|K.We getK=0andψi(N,uT,ρ)=ψi′(N,uT,ρ)for all i ∈ S.□Following the remark just after Theorem 1 and the proof of Theorem 7, the allocation rule define asνi(N,v,ρ)=∫ρdωi(N,v),beingωi(N,v)(L)=ωi(N,v,N/L),satisfies all the axioms except the modified fuzzy fairness axiom. In the same way, the allocation rulesνip(N,v,ρ)=∫ρdψip(N,v)withp=1,2,3,4andψip(N,v)(L)=ψip(N,v,L)satisfies all the axioms except one of them.The prox-Owen value can be seen as a fuzzy version of the Myerson–Owen value for games with communication structures. Similarity relations is the subfamily of proximity relations associated to the a priori unions structures of Owen, because the bilateral relations among the players are transitive. Moreover if ρ is a similarity relation then [ρ]tis a structure of a priori unions for each t ∈ (0, 1]. We can obtain an axiomatization for the prox-Owen value over this subfamily. Obviously the prox-Owen value satisfies efficiency and linearity within this subfamily. As the restriction, the interval scaling and the dual interval scaling of a similarity relation are similarity relations then null group and substitutable leveled groups are also feasible axioms for similarity relations. Observe that the modified fuzzy fairness is not feasible because if we reduce the level of a pair of players we can break up the transitivity. In exchange, we introduce this other axiom used for the Owen value. For a similarity relation ρ and for two different players i, j ∈ N such that there is a group S ∈ N/ρ with i, j ∈ S we denotetij=⋁{tS:S∈N/ρ,i,j∈S}.Substitutable players in a group.Let ρ be a similarity relation over N. If i, j are substitutable for the game (N, v) (as individual coalitions) and there exists a group S ∈ N/ρ with i, j ∈ S thenψi(N,v,ρ)−ψj(N,v,ρ)=(1−tij)[ψi(N,v,ρtij1)−ψj(N,v,ρtij1)]Theorem 8The prox-Owen value is the only value over GS (the set of games with a similarity relation among the players) which satisfies efficiency, null group, substitutable leveled groups, substitutable players in a group and linearity.The uniqueness part is similar to Theorem 7 using substitutable players in a group instead of modified fuzzy fairness.Hence we only have to check that the prox-Owen value satisfies substitutable players in a group over similarity relations. Let i, j ∈ N be two substitutable players in (N, v). As we said in Section 2.3 an a priori union structure is actually a communication structure L where every component is a complete graph, andξ=ω. Suppose L so. If i, j are in the same component in L the equal treatment for players in a union axiom (see Section 2.2) of the Owen value impliesξi(N,v)(L)=ξj(N,v)(L).Let ρ be a similarity relation with a group containing players i, j. Using Proposition 5 with number tijwe haveηi(N,v,ρ)−(1−tij)ηi(N,v,ρtij1)=tij∫ρ0tijdξi(N,v)ηj(N,v,ρ)−(1−tij)ηj(N,v,ρtij1)=tij∫ρ0tijdξj(N,v)For eacht∈im(ρ0tij)we taker=ttijwith r ∈ (0, tij] and[ρ0tij]t=[ρ]r. As r ∈ (0, tij] then i, j are contained in the same connected component of [ρ]r. Therefore∫ρ0tijdξi(N,v)=∫ρ0tijdξj(N,v)□

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have introduced games with a proximity relation among the players. Proximity relations allow us to level the closeness relation among the players. This closeness can be interpreted as ideological proximity, social relation, economic interest or personal feeling. We propose an Owen-type value for these situations using the Choquet integral. Besides, an axiomatization for the value is given taking into account fuzzy conditions according to the context of the data. This work highlights how the properties of the Choquet integral are a powerful tool for the analysis of the fuzzy relations among the agents in a bargaining situation. The notation of the prox-Owen value as a Choquet integral simplifies the expression of the axioms and it also allows to see how the properties of the Choquet integral intervene in the proofs. Expression (11) shows the prox-Owen value as a linear combination of the Myerson–Owen value of the cuts. This formula is the calculus tool of the value as we show in the example. Also this last expression allows to interpret the axioms as intervals of different situations. Although the analysis of the proximity relations is a progress with respect to the foregoing knowledge in the Owen line, other interesting open problems are feasible using fuzzy tools. So, fuzzy cognitive maps or bipolar fuzzy cognitive maps will allow us to describe subjective closeness of the agents and positive or negative attraction among them.
