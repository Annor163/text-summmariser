HighlightWe conducted performance testing to investigate the performance and limitations of this EHR/OpenXDS system.The performance testing was conducted for three use cases, EHR submissions, queries, and retrievals, based on the IHE XDS.b profile for EHR sharing.We retrieved the transaction logs and also monitored the consuming of hardware resources during the test cases execution to detect more details of the EHR/OpenXDS system's limitations.From the testing results, we provided tuning suggestions and future works for the following implementers/studies to keep improving the EHR/OpenXDS system.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundTo integrate electronic health records (EHRs) from diverse document sources across healthcare providers, facilities, or medical institutions, the IHE XDS.b profile can be considered as one of the solutions. In this research, we have developed an EHR/OpenXDS system which adopted the OpenXDS, an open source software that complied with the IHE XDS.b profile, and which achieved the EHR interoperability.ObjectiveWe conducted performance testing to investigate the performance and limitations of this EHR/OpenXDS system.MethodologyThe performance testing was conducted for three use cases, EHR submission, query, and retrieval, based on the IHE XDS.b profile for EHR sharing. In addition, we also monitored the depletion of hardware resources (including the CPU usage, memory usage, and network usage) during the test cases execution to detect more details of the EHR/OpenXDS system's limitations.ResultsIn this EHR/OpenXDS system, the maximum affordable workload of the EHR submissions were 400 EHR submissions per hour, the DSA CPU usage was 20%, memory usage was 1380MB, the network usages were 0.286KB input and 7.58KB output per minute; the DPA CPU usage was 1%, memory usage was 1770MB, the network usages were 7.75KB input and 1.54KB output per minute; the DGA CPU usage was 24%, memory usage was 2130MB, the network usages were 1.3KB input and 0.174KB output per minute. The maximum affordable workload of the EHR queries were 600 EHR queries per hour, the DCA CPU usage was 66%, the memory usage was 1660MB, the network usages were 0.230KB input and 0.251KB output per minute; the DGA CPU usage was 1%, the memory usage was 1890MB, the network usages were 0.273KB input and 0.22KB output per minute. The maximum affordable workload of the EHR retrievals were 2000 EHR retrievals, the DCA CPU usage was 79%, the memory usage was 1730MB, the network usages were 19.55KB input and 1.12KB output per minute; the DPA CPU usage was 3.75%, the memory usage was 2310MB, and the network usages were 0.956KB input and 19.57KB output per minute.Discussion and conclusionFrom the research results, we suggest that future implementers who deployed the EHR/OpenXDS system should consider the following aspects. First, to ensure how many service volumes would be provided in the environment and then to adjust the hardware resources. Second, the IHE XDS.b profile is adopted by the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web service, it might then move onto the Restful (representational state transfer) web service which is more efficient than the SOAP web service. Third, the concurrency process ability should be added in the OpenXDS source code to improve the hardware usage more efficiently while processing the ITI-42, ITI-18, and ITI-43 transactions. Four, this research suggests that the work should continue on adjusting the memory usage for the modules of the OpenXDS thereby using the memory resource more efficiently, e.g., the memory configuration of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Apache Tomcat, and Apache Axis2. Fifth, to consider if the hardware monitoring would be required in the implementing environment. These research results provided some test figures to refer to, and it also gave some tuning suggestions and future works to continue improving the performance of the OpenXDS.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Population aging and chronic disease have gradually grown throughout the world [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) are integrated from different document sources across healthcare providers, hospitals, and/or medical institutions, and can be used to enhance disease management, facilitate communications, and improve the quality of care [1â€“3]. Naturally, the sharing and exchanging of the EHRs across healthcare facilities and institutions in different geographical regions are now attracting a lot of attention [4]. Integrating the healthcare enterprise (IHE) [5] is promoted by healthcare professionals and industries to improve the way computer systems in healthcare services share information through organizing the established standards, such as the DICOM and HL7, to comprehend specific clinical needs in supporting optimal patient care [5]. One of the IHE profiles, the cross-enterprise document sharing profile (XDS.b) [6], defines the generic architecture on how to share clinical information, provide a standards-based specification for managing the sharing of patient's EHRs between health enterprises, such as hospitals, physician's offices, and clinics. There are many third party open source systems released for implementation of the IHE XDS.b profile. Bruno [7] surveyed nine IHE XDS related open source systems, and found that the OpenXDS system, which is a server side implementation of the IHE XDS.b profile, provides the capacity of good implementation and easy deployment [8]. The OpenXDS has been widely used as a solution in many EHR integrating projects [9]. Several technical and consultant reports also suggested that the OpenXDS could be a component to use in the construction of the Health Information Exchange (HIE) related products [10], and an open source tool to address interoperability framework implementation needs [11]. In this research, we built the EHR system which adopted the OpenXDS as a component to achieve the IHE XDS.b based clinical document sharing. Due to the need for the exchange of the EHRs across health care facilities and/or institutions during their patient encounters, the high performance online transaction processing (OLTP) systems are critical. Therefore, it is very important to know the system performance and service quality of the EHR system based on the OpenXDS framework, or by the abbreviated name of EHR/OpenXDS system. However, there were only a few studies that have investigated the performance issues of the OpenXDS system for exchanges of the EHRs across different systems. Therefore, this research mainly focused on the evaluation of the performance and service quality of the EHR/OpenXDS systems and provided recommendations for system tuning and implementation strategies based on the evaluation.
