This paper presents an algorithm for decomposing complex line drawings which depict connected 3D manifolds into multiple simpler drawings of individual manifolds. The decomposition process has three stages: decomposition at non-manifold vertices, along non-manifold edges and across internal faces. Once non-manifold vertices and/or edges are found, the decomposition can be performed straightforwardly. Thus the major task in this paper is decomposition across internal faces. This has two steps: basic decomposition and repair of incomplete parts. The decomposition process is performed before face identification which is computationally expensive. After decomposition, the time for face finding is much reduced and this, in turn, greatly improves the process for 3D reconstruction, which is the ultimate goal.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
3D reconstruction from 2D line drawings has been an active research topic for decades. An early general 3D recovery method, the optimization-based method, was first proposed by Marill  [1], and improved by Leclerc and Fischler  [2], Lipson and Shpitalni  [3] and Liu et al.  [4]. This method can recover 3D objects true to human perception, but the performance is inconsistent, as the experiments of Lee and Fang  [5] show. Most algorithms have two major components: face finding and 3D recovery. There are a number of algorithms reported for face finding. The algorithms of Lipson and Shpitalni  [6], Liu and Lee  [7,8] and Liu and Tang  [9] have an exponential complexity over the number of input vertices,n, while that of Varley and Company  [10] has a complexity of O(n5). Leong et al.  [11] developed a face finding algorithm that is an improvement over existing methods in general, but still has an exponential worst case complexity.The complexity of the actual 3D recovery is O(n3)  [3]. Lee and Fang  [12] proposed a different recovery method exploiting cubic corners, which are trihedral vertices with mutually perpendicular edges. The method also requires face finding, with the same accompanying time complexity, but its complexity for 3D recovery is linear overn. Whether one uses the optimization-based method, the cubic corner method, or their hybrid  [5], it is clear that the lower the value ofn, the better the algorithms perform. If a drawing withnvertices can be partitioned intomcomponents each with an average ofn/mvertices, then the overall complexity for face finding using the algorithm by Varley and Company would beO(m∗(n/m)5)=O(n5/m4), which is a lot lower. Hence, drawing partition is a useful preprocess to actual face finding and 3D object recovery provided, of course, it is sufficiently efficient itself.This paper proposes a novel method for decomposing complex line drawings without requiring face information. It is important to note that vertices exist explicitly when edges in the same plane intersect and the decomposition is made at existing vertices and edges, without introducing any new ones.We introduce here the special terms that appear in the rest of the paper. Fig. 1shows the decomposition of a line drawing and illustrates some of the terms.Manifold: A manifold is a solid where every point in its surface has a neighborhood topologically equivalent to an open disk in the 2D Euclidean space  [13].Simple manifold: A simple manifold is a manifold that cannot be decomposed into simpler manifolds at existing vertices, along existing edges or across internal faces.Complex manifold: A complex manifold is a manifold that can be decomposed into simpler manifolds at existing vertices, along existing edges or across internal faces.Degree of vertex: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges meeting at the vertex.Rank of edge: The rank of an edge is the number of faces sharing the edge.Non-manifold vertex: A non-manifold vertex is a vertex where a non-manifold can be decomposed to produce multiple simpler manifolds.Non-manifold edge: A non-manifold edge is an edge along which a non-manifold can be decomposed to produce multiple simpler manifolds.Internal face: An internal face could be thought of as the face formed by gluing two faces of two manifolds together to form one manifold, and is thus internal to the combined manifold and is not a true face.Isolated vertex: A vertex that belongs to only one simple manifold after the decomposition of a complex manifold.Complete part: A complete part is a decomposed part that contains vertices with degree 3 or more.Incomplete part: An incomplete part is a decomposed part that contains vertices with degree 2 or less.The decomposition of a complex manifold or non-manifold must result in a collection of simpler manifolds and, in the best case, a collection of simple manifolds. There should not be any dangling edges containing vertices with degree 1 or faces containing vertices with degree 2. This is a condition that we use to check for the correctness of the decomposition, because a drawing with all its vertices having degree 3 or more can be considered as a manifold topologically  [14,11].
