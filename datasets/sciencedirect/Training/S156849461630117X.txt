@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Conventionally, optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is described as the minimization of active power transmission losses and/or total voltage deviation by controlling a number of control variables while satisfying certain equality and inequality constraints. This article presents a newly developed meta-heuristic approach, chaotic krill herd algorithm (CKHA), for the solution of the ORPD problem of power system incorporating flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The proposed CKHA is implemented and its performance is tested, successfully, on standard IEEE 30-bus test power system. The considered power system models are equipped with two types of FACTS controllers (namely, thyristor controlled series capacitor and thyristor controlled phase shifter). Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach yields superior solution over other popular methods surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including chaos embedded few newly developed optimization techniques. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness for the solution of ORPD problem of power system considering FACTS devices. Finally, simulation is extended to some large-scale power system models like IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power systems for the same objectives to emphasis on the scalability of the proposed CKHA technique. The scalability, the robustness and the superiority of the proposed CKHA are established in this paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The main objective of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is to identify the optimal settings of all the control variables (e.g., generator reactive power outputs, on-load tap changers of transformers, output of the shunt capacitors/reactors etc.) which minimizes either total transmission line loss (PLoss) or that of absolute value of total voltage deviation (TVD) while satisfying certain constraints (e.g., equality and inequality constraints) [1].Till date, many classical mathematical programming based techniques as well as heuristic algorithms like nonlinear programming [2], linear programming [3], mixed integer programming [4], quadratic programming [5,6], decomposition approach [7], Newton-based method [8], dynamic programming [9], interior point method [10], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [11], hybrid PSO [12], genetic algorithm (GA) [13], adaptive GA (AGA) [14], improved GA [15], bacteria foraging optimization [16], artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm [17], differential evolution (DE) [18], seeker optimization algorithm [19], multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) [20], fuzzy optimization strategy and fuzzy adaptive PSO [21], comprehensive learning PSO [22], biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [23], modified version of non-dominated sorting GA-II [24], multi-objective based harmony search algorithm (HSA) [25], opposition based gravitational search algorithm [26,27], teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) [28], quasi-oppositional TLBO [28], chaotic invasive weed optimization (IWO) [29], hybrid form of modified imperialist competitive algorithm and IWO method [30], gray wolf optimizer [31]etc. have been applied, successfully, in the literature for solving the ORPD problem of power system.Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices are being used in the recent days to increase the transmission capability as well as to improve stability and reliability of the power system [32]. Also, these devices are capable to control current, voltage, impedance and phase angle of the transmission system to increase the power system stability, power factor correction, loss minimization and most, importantly, management of the active and reactive power flow and voltage profile [33]. Recently, the conventional ORPD problem incorporated with FACTS devices has been proposed for controlling the active and reactive power flow by employing GA [34], DE [34], PSO [34], MOEA [35], real-coded GA (RCGA) [36], PSO with inertia weight approach (PSOIWA) [36] and BBO [36]etc. for solving ORPD problem of power system incorporating FACTS devices.Krill herd algorithm (KHA) is a novel meta-heuristic search approach, introduced by Gandomi and Alavi in 2012 [37]. KHA analogy is based on the simulation of the herding behavior of krill swarms in nature. Three different actions (viz. (a) motion induced by other krill, (b) foraging activity and (c) random diffusion) determine the current position of each individual krill swarm. The objective function, used in KHA, is supposed to be a combination of the least distances of the position of the food and the highest density of the herd [37]. Recently, KHA methodology is becoming popular in various areas of research fields such as portfolio optimization problem [38], numerical optimization problem [39], structural optimization problem [40]etc. KHA has been also proposed in different research interests like global numerical optimization problem for phase stability and phase equilibrium calculations [41], production scheduling problem [42], optimum design of truss structures [43] and so on.A few variants of hybrid KHA have been proposed in literatures like BBO based KHA with migration operator [44], opposition based KHA with cauchy mutation and position clamping [45], quantum-behaved PSO based KHA [46] and so on. Also, some variants of hybrid KHA have been proposed for global numerical optimization problems, such as HSA based KHA [47], simulated annealing (SA) based KHA [48], cuckoo search based KHA [49], chaotic PSO based KHA [50], DE based KHA [51], GA based KHA incorporating stud selection and crossover operator [52], etc.In the present work, the concept of chaos theory is incorporated in the basic KHA for achieving enhanced computational speed and improved convergence characteristics. Earlier, chaotic maps have been used with a variety of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms like GA [53], SA [54], PSO [55], ant colony optimization [56], firefly algorithm (FA) [57], HSA [58], ABC [59], bat algorithm (BA) [60] and KHA [61]. All these works have showed improved response and increased accuracy in different fields of engineering applications.In the current article, chaotic KHA (CKHA) is implemented on standard IEEE 30-bus test power system installed with two FACTS devices, namely, thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) at the fixed strategic locations for the purpose of ORPD study. It is presented from the simulation results that the proposed CKHA technique yields better results and good convergence characteristic as compared to some other computational intelligence based techniques surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature. The proposed CKHA is also applied on another two IEEE standard test power systems viz. IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems for the performance assessment of the proposed CKHA algorithm on large-scale power system and validation purpose. The performance of the chaos map embedded with two new algorithms is also compared to the proposed CKHA algorithm. To accomplish this objective, chaos map is blended with two recently surfaced algorithms like FA [57] and BA [60] and these newly formed two algorithms are termed as chaotic FA (CFA) and chaotic BA (CBA), respectively, in this work. Assessment of critical performance indices for the objective values such as the best value, the worst value, the standard deviation and the saving percent of reactive power loss for the studied three test systems (out of independent trial runs) is also going to present to establish the superiority of the proposed CKHA algorithm for the handled power system optimization application.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 represents the modeling part of FACTS devices. Mathematical problem formulation of the present work is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes the basic KHA. Section 5 illustrates the proposed CKHA. Simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 6. Finally, conclusions of the present work are drawn in Section 7 along with focussing on some future directions.The effect of TCSC on a power network may be represented by a controllable reactance inserted in series with the related transmission line. Active power flow through the compensated transmission line may be maintained at a specified level under wide range of operating conditions [33,62,63]. The static model of the network with TCSC connected between the pth and the qth bus is shown in Fig. 1[33,63]. The power flow equations of the branch having TCSC are given by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively [36,64].(1)Ppq=Vp2Gpq−VpVqGpqcos(δp−δq)−VpVqBpqsin(δp−δq)(2)Qpq=−Vp2Bpq−VpVqGpqsin(δp−δq)+VpVqBpqcos(δp−δq)Similarly, the real and reactive power flows from the qth to the pth bus may be expressed by Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively,(3)Pqp=Vq2Gpq−VpVqGpqcos(δp−δq)+VpVqBpqsin(δp−δq)(4)Qqp=−Vq2Bpq+VpVqGpqsin(δp−δq)+VpVqBpqcos(δp−δq)where,(5)Conductance of transmission line(Gpq)=RpqRpq2+(Xpq−XTCSC)2(6)Susceptance of transmission line(Bpq)=−Xpq−XTCSCRpq2+(Xpq−XTCSC)2andPpq, Qpq: real and reactive power flows between the pth and the qth bus, respectively,Vp, Vq: voltage magnitudes at bus p and q, respectively,δp, δq: voltage angles at the pth and the qth bus, respectively,Rpq, Xpq: resistance and reactance of the transmission line, respectively,XTCSC: reactance of TCSC placed in the transmission line connected between the pth and the qth bus.TCPS may be modeled by a phase shifting transformer having a complex tapping ratio of1:1∠ϕand series admittance ofYpq(=Gpq−sqrt(−1)Bpq)connected between the pth and the qth bus as shown in Fig. 2[33,63]. The corresponding power flow equations of the line may be expressed by Eqs. (7)–(10)[62,64].(7)Ppq=Vp2Gpqcos2ϕ−VpVqcosϕ[Gpqcos(δp−δq+ϕ)+Bpqsin(δp−δq+ϕ)](8)Qpq=−Vp2Bpqcos2ϕ−VpVqcosϕ[Gpqsin(δp−δq+ϕ)−Bpqcos(δp−δq+ϕ)](9)Pqp=Vq2Gpq−VpVqcosϕ[Gpqcos(δp−δq+ϕ)−Bpqsin(δp−δq+ϕ)](10)Qqp=−Vq2Bpq+VpVqcosϕ[Gpqsin(δp−δq+ϕ)+Bpqcos(δp−δq+ϕ)]The static model of TCPS is shown in Fig. 3[33,63]. The injected active and reactive powers of the TCPS at the pth and the qth bus may be derived by Eqs. (11)–(14)[62,64].(11)Pps=−GpqVp2tan2ϕ−VpVqtanϕ[Gpqsin(δp−δq)−Bpqcos(δp−δq)](12)Qps=BpqVp2tan2ϕ+VpVqtanϕ[Gpqcos(δp−δq)+Bpqsin(δp−δq)](13)Pqs=−VpVqtanϕ[Gpqsin(δp−δq)+Bpqcos(δp−δq)](14)Qqs=−VpVqtanϕ[Gpqcos(δp−δq)−Bpqsin(δp−δq)]ORPD problem is, mainly, concerned with either minimization of PLoss or that of TVD satisfying various equality and inequality constraints [65].The general formulation of PLoss minimization problem may be expressed in Eq. (15)[65](15)MinimizeJ1(x1,x2)=MinimizePLoss=∑k=1NL[Gk(Vp2+Vq2−2VpVqcosδpq)](16)Subject to:{g(x1,x2)=0h(x1,x2)≤0where,J1(x1,x2) : active power transmission loss minimization function,x1: vector of dependent variables consisting of load voltages(VL1,...,VLNPQ), generators’ reactive powers(QG1,...,QGNPV)and transmission line loadings(SL1,...,SLNL),x2: vector of control variables consisting of generators’ voltages(VG1,...,VGNPV), transformers’ tap settings(T1,...,TNT)and reactive power injections(QC1,...,QCNC),Gk: conductance of branch k,Vp, Vq: voltages of the pth and the qth buses, respectively,δpq: voltage angle difference between buses p and q,Therefore,x1andx2may be expressed by Eqs.

It is inspired by the herding behavior of krill swarms in response to the searching for food in nature. Combination of two main characteristics (viz. exploration or random search and exploitation or local search) plays a very significant role to achieve highest performance in solving optimization problem. The krill herd approach involves three movements and follows the search directions to enhance the objective function value. These three movements are [37]:(a)movement induced by other krill individuals,foraging activity andrandom diffusion.Regular KHA may be expressed by Lagrangian model in an n dimensional decision space, as presented in Eq. (28)[66](28)dUidt=Ii+Fi+Riwhere,Ii: induced motion of other krill individuals,Fi: foraging motion,Ri: random diffusion of the krill individuals,i: number of an individual krill,t: number of generation.a)Movement induced by other krill individualsIn this process, the krill individuals try to maintain a high density and the velocity of each individual is influenced by the movement of others. The direction of motion induced(ψi)is, approximately, evaluated by three effects, namely, (a) local effect, (b) target effect and (c) repulsive effect. For an individual krill i, this motion may be expressed by Eq. (29)[67](29)Iinew=ψiImax+αIioldwhere,(30)ψi=ψiLocal+ψiTargetandImax: maximum induced motion,α: inertia weight of the motion induced in the range [0, 1],Iiold: previous induced motion of the ith krill individual,ψiLocal: local effect,ψiTarget: target effect.b)Foraging activityForaging activity is determined by two main factors. First one is the present food location while the second one is the information about the previous food location. The foraging velocity may be expressed for the ith krill individual as in Eq. (31)[37](31)Fi=VFγi+αFFioldwhere,(32)γi=γiFOOD+γiBESTandVF: foraging speed (its value is chosen as 0.02),αF: inertia weight of the foraging motion which is defined between 0 and 1,Fiold: previous foraging motion of the ith krill,γiFOOD: attractiveness for food,γiBEST: effect of the best fitness of the ith krill.c)Random diffusionThe random diffusion process of the krill individuals is, mainly, considered to enhance the population diversity. Basically, this motion may be expressed as a function of maximum diffusion speed and a random directional vector. It may be formulated by Eq. (33)[37](33)Rp=ξRmaxwhere,Rmax: maximum diffusion speed,ξ: random directional vector lies between [−1, 1].Generally, the defined motions in KHA change frequently to the position of a krill to achieve the best one. The second and third motions, induced by another krill individual, involve two global and two local strategies. These techniques are used in parallel to make the KHA an effective and powerful method [68]. The position of a krill individual i in the time interval[t,t+Δt]may be formulated by Eq. (34)[37](34)Ui(t+Δt)=Ui(t)+ΔtdUidtwhere,Δt: key constant (factor of scaling in the speed vector).The value ofΔtmay be expressed by Eq. (35)(35)Δt=PC∑j=1nv(uj−lj)where,nv: total number of variables,uj, lj: upper and lower limits of the jth variables, respectively,PC: position constant number between [0, 2].In order to improve the performance of the optimization problem and speed up the convergence property, the crossover and mutation process of DE algorithm is incorporated in KHA [37].(a)CrossoverCrossover process is, mainly, controlled by a parameter (termed as crossover probability (CR)). To update the position of its own, each individual krill interacts with the others. In this process, the jth component of the ith krill may be formulated as [69]:(36)Ui,j={Um,jifrand≤CRUi,jifrand>CRwhere,m=1,2,...,N(37)CR=0.2zibestwhere,zibest: the best previous meet location for krill i.(b)MutationMutation process is, mainly, controlled by a parameter (named as mutation probability (MR)). This process may be formulated as [69]:(38)Ui,j=Ubest,j+γ(Us,j−Ut,j)where,Ubest,j: global best vector,Us,j, Ut,j: two randomly selected vectors,γ: scalar number between 0 and 1.The modified value ofUi,jis formulated as follows [69]:(39)Ui,jmod={Ui,jnewifrand≤MRUi,jifrand>MRThe flowchart of the KHA is shown in Fig. 4. The computational procedure of this algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 1.Similar to a random process, chaos is a phenomenon that is considered as an erratic movement. Twelve different chaotic maps including their mathematical expressions are described in Table 1. In KHA, the main parameters are inertia weights(α,αF)that decide the convergence speed. In order to improve the search behavior and converge to the best solution, chaos is integrated in this paper with the original KHA.The computational procedure of the proposed CKHA is presented in Algorithm 2and the corresponding flowchart of the proposed method is depicted in Fig. 5.The main steps of the proposed CKHA approach, as applied to ORPD problem with FACTS devices of the present work, are described in Algorithm 3.In order to demonstrate the applicability and the validity of the proposed CKHA algorithm for ORPD problem with FACTS devices, standard IEEE 30-bus test power system is considered. All the simulations are carried out using MATLAB 2008a computing environment on a 2.63GHz Pentium IV personal computer with 3GB RAM. For establishing the superiority of the proposed CKHA, thirty independent test trial runs are performed for all the test cases and the simulation results along with comparative discussions are reported in this section. The value ofNFFEmaxis set to 500 for all the simulated test cases. To indicate the optimization capability of the proposed CKHA, the results of interest are bold faced in the respective tables. Out of the twelve chaotic maps considered in this paper, it is observed that Liebovitch map offers the best results. The subsequent discussions of the present paper are based on Liebovitch map blended with KHA which is termed as CKHA. In the present work, four different cases of ORPD study for standard IEEE 30-bus test power system are carried out. These are:(a)Case 1.1: ORPD without FACTS devices [36],Case 1.2: ORPD with two TCSCs [36],Case 1.3: ORPD with two TCSCs and one TCPS [36] andCase 1.4: ORPD with three TCSCs and three TCPSs [36].In this case, CKHA algorithm is applied to solve ORPD problem without incorporating any FACTS devices [36].i)Minimization of PLossCKHA based results of ORPD problem for active power transmission loss minimization objective of this test system are presented in Table 2. In this table, CKHA based results are compared to those offered by some other optimization techniques recently reported in the literature like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36], craziness based PSO (CRPSO) [70], turbulent crazy PSO (TRPSO) [70] and BBO [36]. The obtained minimum real power loss is found to be 6.3103MW from the proposed approach of the present paper. The value of PLoss (MW), as yielded by CKHA, is 0.0569MW (i.e., 0.8936% less than BBO based best result of 6.3672MW reported in [36]). Fig. 6portrays the convergence profile of this objective function. From this figure it is observed that the PLoss value converges smoothly at lesser NFFEs for the proposed CKHA method.ii)Minimization of TVDTable 3represents the optimal values of the control variables, as obtained by the proposed CKHA approach, for the solution of the ORPD problem of this test system. The results obtained from the proposed CKHA are compared to those yielded by PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36], CRPSO [70], TRPSO [70] and BBO [36]. This table shows that TVD reduction of 1.11% (i.e., 0.12277p.u.) takes place from the previous best result of 0.12415p.u., as reported by using BBO in [36]. Fig. 7shows that the proposed CKHA based convergence characteristic of TVD minimization objective for this test system and the nature of this characteristic is found to be promising one.In this case, two TCSC devices (one in the transmission line connected between the buses {4–12} and the other in the transmission line connected between buses {27–28}) are placed in the studied test power system [36].i)Minimization of PLossThe best control variable settings for active power transmission loss minimization objective of this test system, as yielded by the proposed CKHA method, are tabulated in Table 4. Simulation results obtained from CKHA are compared to those offered by some other optimization techniques such as PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36]. From this table, 1.426% reduction in PLoss may be recorded by the adopting the proposed CKHA algorithm (i.e., 6.2532MW) as compared to BBO (i.e., 6.3437MW) counterpart reported in [36]. Convergence profile of minimum PLoss (MW), corresponding to CKHA for this test system, is shown in Fig. 8. It may be observed from this figure that PLoss value converges smoothly at lesser value of NFFEs for the proposed CKHA one.ii)Minimization of TVDThe optimal settings of control variables for TVD minimization objective of this test case, as obtained by the proposed CKHA technique, are reported in Table 5along with those offered by some other algorithms like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36]. It may be noted from this table that the obtained TVD value is 0.11724p.u. while using CKHA. This proves that voltage deviation reduction of 2.81% has been taken place while adopting CKHA as compared to the previous best algorithm like BBO (i.e., 0.12063p.u.) [36]. The CKHA based convergence profile of TVD (p.u.), shown in Fig. 9, presents that CKHA converges smoothly.In this case, two TCSCs and one TCPS are placed in the lines connecting between buses {4–12}, {27–28} and {2–5} of standard IEEE 30-bus test power system [36].i)Minimization of PLossThe objective considered in this case is to minimize the value of PLoss. Table 6depicts the best solutions of optimal settings of control variables for the proposed CKHA to solve the ORPD problem of power system with FACTS devices of this test system. CKHA based results are also compared to those yielded by some other optimization techniques like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36]. From this table, the value of PLoss corresponding to CKHA may be noted as 6.2504MW (i.e., 0.6595% less as compared to BBO based one reported in [36]). The same yielded by BBO may be noted as 6.2919MW [36]. The convergence characteristic, as offered by CKHA, is portrayed in Fig. 10which presents that CKHA based objective function value for this objective of the studied test system converges smoothly and reaches the near global optimal value with lesser number of NFFEs.ii)Minimization of TVDThe best ORPD solutions, as yielded by the CKHA, for TVD minimization objective for this test case, are tabulated in Table 7. The same reported in the recent literature like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36] are also featured in the same table. Minimum value of TVD, as obtained by the proposed CKHA approach, is found to be 0.11346p.u. (i.e., 4.309% less than the BBO based best result of 0.11857p.u. reported in [36]). CKHA based convergence profile of TVD (p.u.) for this case is presented in Fig. 11. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence mobility of TVD (p.u.) for the proposed CKHA based approach is promising one.The standard IEEE 30-bus test system with three TCSCs (placed in the lines connecting buses {4–12}, {16–17} and {27–28}) and three TCPSs (placed in the lines connecting buses {2–5}, {6–10} and {14–15}) are considered in this case in line with Ref. [36].i)Minimization of PLossTable 8illustrates the optimal settings of the control variables for PLoss minimization objective offered by the proposed CKHA. These results are compared to those offered by some other optimization methods like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36]. It may be inferred from this table that the obtained PLoss value from the proposed CKHA is 6.2669MW. This proves a loss reduction of 0.3165% has taken place while adopting the proposed CKHA as compared to the previous algorithm like BBO [36]. Good convergence profile of PLoss (MW), as yielded by the proposed CKHA, may be noted from Fig. 12. This figure illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method by means of its ability to reach the near-global optimal solution.ii)Minimization of TVDTable 9depicts the best control variable settings, as obtained by the proposed CKHA, for the solution of the ORPD problem with FACTS devices of this test case for TVD minimization objective. The obtained results for this objective of the test system are compared to some other recently reported results offered by some other popular techniques like PSOIWA [36], RCGA [36], DE [36] and BBO [36]. It may be noted from this table that TVD reduction of nearly 0.00528p.u. (i.e., 4.5%) is achieved while adopting CKHA (i.e., 0.11198p.u.) over the BBO (i.e., 0.11726p.u.) reported in Ref. [36]. It is fascinating to note from Fig. 13that the CKHA based convergence profile of TVD (p.u.) converges smoothly to the near global solution with lesser NFFEs.For the purpose of scalability testing of the proposed CKHA, it is also applied on large-scale test power systems like IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus test power systems. The earlier conducted all the test cases of standard IEEE 30-bus are once again repeated for these two large-scale tests power system topologies.For IEEE 57-bus test system, the considered four test cases are:(a)Case 2.1: ORPD without FACTS devicesCase 2.2: ORPD with two TCSCs (installed between buses {18–19} and {31–32}) [64],Case 2.3: ORPD with two TCSCs and one TCPS (TCSCs are installed between buses {18–19} and {31–32} [64] where as the TCPS is installed in {4–5}) [64]Case 2.4: ORPD with three TCSCs and three TCPSs (TCSCs are installed in buses {18–19}, {31–32} and {31–32} [64] where as TCPSs are installed in {4–5}, {5–6} and {26–27}) [64].Similarly, the considered four test cases for IEEE 118-bus test system are as follows:(a)Case 3.1: ORPD without FACTS devicesCase 3.2: ORPD with two TCSCs (installed between buses {43–44} and {44–45}) [71]Case 3.3: ORPD with two TCSCs and one TCPS (TCSCs are installed between buses {43–44} and {44–45} [71] where as the TCPS is installed in {24–72}) [72]Case 3.4: ORPD with three TCSCs and three TCPSs (TCSCs are installed in buses {43–44}, {44–45} and {45–46} [71] where as TCPSs are installed in {24–72}, {71–72} and {82–83}) [72].The best control variables settings of PLoss and TVD for PLoss and TVD minimization objectives of IEEE 57-bus test system are reported in Tables 10–13. For IEEE 118-bus test system, the best control variables settings for PLoss and TVD values for PLoss and TVD minimization objectives are tabulated in Tables 14–17.A comparison table consisting of CKHA based simulation results along with those offered by CFA and CBA for all the three considered test systems is included in Table 18. From this table, it may be noted that lesser values of PLoss (MW) and TVD (p.u.) are achieved for all the test cases of the studied three power system models while considering the proposed CKHA over the other two chaos-embedded new algorithms. Thus, the superiority and the scalability of the proposed CKHA technique are indicated.Table 19represents some critical performance indices (i.e., the minimum value, the maximum value, the average value, the standard deviation and the percentage save of reactive power loss out of independent thirty trial runs) for the studied standard IEEE 30-bus test system pertaining to the different test cases as considered earlier. The highlighting feature of this table is that the proposed CKHA algorithm offers the minimum values of both the objectives (i.e., PLoss minimization and TVD minimization) for all the adopted test cases. However, the values of standard deviations and percentage save of reactive power loss for the other reported algorithms are not available in the referred articles.The t-test method is a statistical assessment to measure the considerable variation between two algorithms. Mathematically, it may be formulated, as in Eq. (40)[73](40)t=α¯2−α¯1(σ22/(ξ+1))+(σ12/(ξ+1))where,α¯1andα¯2are the mean values of the first and second algorithms, respectively;σ1andσ2are the standard deviations of the first and second algorithms, respectively andξis the value of the degree of freedom.Positive value of t will indicate that the first algorithm is superior to the second one and vice-versa. When the t value is greater than 1.645 withξ=49, a significant difference has been established with a 95% confidence level [73]. The t-test is carried out for all the three considered test systems and these values are featured in Tables 20–22. From the tables, it may be seen that the t-values of greater than 0.0366 (ξ=49) are obtained for all the techniques including CKHA which proves that a substantial difference between the proposed CKHA and the other methods with a confidence level of 99% is achieved. It may also be concluded that the computational time for CKHA is lesser than the other chaotic embedded algorithms (like CBA and CFA), as shown in Tables 20–22. Thus, the robustness of the proposed CKHA approach may be established.Evolutionary algorithms (those are nature-inspired and, mainly, based on swarm intelligence behavior) may not be able to deal with the constraint-handling mechanism of constraints for solving numerical optimization problems. Recently, researches are going on for handling these constraints to solve nature inspired algorithms. The most remarkable and representative techniques are presented and discussed in Ref. [74]. Penalty factor approach may be also be used to find out the violated results in optimization problem. Ensemble of constrained handling techniques has been also considered in Ref. [75]. For further interest on this topic, the works presented in Refs. [74,75] may be referred. However, ensemble of constraint-handling technique [75] has been adopted for the present work.A newly developed meta-heuristic like CKHA has been, successfully, implemented to solve the ORPD problem of power system incorporating multiple FACTS devices while considering four different case studies on three IEEE standard power system topologies. The ORPD problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints of the power network and physical parameters of the FACTS devices. In this study, minimization of active power loss and that of total absolute voltage deviation are, individually, considered as objective function. From the simulation work, it is observed that the proposed CKHA algorithm yields optimal settings of the control variables for the various case studies. The performance of chaos embedded two new algorithms is also assessed in this work and it is observed that the proposed CKHA is offering better result as compared to these two chaos embedded new algorithms. The simulation results also indicate the robustness, the scalability and the superiority of the proposed approach to solve the ORPD problem of power systems considering FACTS devices. Thus, the proposed CKHA algorithm may be recommended for the future researchers as a very promising algorithm for solving some more other complex engineering optimization problems.
