@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We analyze split cuts from the perspective of cut generating functions via geometric lifting. We show that α-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuéjols et al., give all the split cuts for the mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split cuts for the 1-row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split cuts for finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split cuts for the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closure has arbitrarily bad integrality gap. This complements the mixed-integer example provided by Basu et al. (2011).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The existing literature on cutting planes for general integer programs can be roughly partitioned into two classes. One class of cutting planes relies on the paradigm of cut-generating functions (CGFs) (Conforti, Cornuéjols, Daniilidis, Lemaréchal, and Jérôme, 2013), whose roots can be traced back to Gomory and Johnson’s work in the 1970s. Prominent examples in this class are Gomory mixed-integer cuts (GMI), mixed-integer rounding cuts (MIR), reduce-and-split cuts and k-cuts (Andersen, Cornuéjols, and Li, 2005a; Cornuéjols, Li, and Vandenbussche, 2003; Gomory, 1963; Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990). The other class of cutting planes is based on the idea taking convex hulls of disjunctions; this perspective goes back to Balas’ work on disjunctive programming (Balas, 1979). Examples in this class are split cuts, lift-and-project cuts and, more recently, t-branch disjunctions (Balas, Ceria, and Cornuéjols, 1993; Dash and Günlük, 2013; Sherali and Adams, 1990).One important advantage of the cut-generating function paradigm is that often they give closed form formulas to generate cuts that can be computed very efficiently. In contrast, the disjunctive programming paradigm usually involves solving a cut generating linear program(Balas et al., 1993), which can be computationally expensive. This leads to a significant blowup in time required to generate cuts using the disjunctive paradigm, as opposed to the cut generating function framework. Hence, there is great value in results which show that a certain family of disjunctive cuts can also be obtained by cut generating functions that are computable efficiently. Moreover, establishing connections between the cut-generating and the disjunctive paradigms contributes to the overarching goal of obtaining a more complete understanding of cutting planes.In this paper, we analyze the family of split cuts(Cook, Kannan, and Schrijver, 1990) from this viewpoint. Split cuts are one of the most important cuts in practice and their effective use was responsible for a major improvement in MIP solvers since the 1990s (Achterberg and Wunderling, 2013; Bixby, Fenelon, Gu, Rothberg, and Wunderling, 2004). Due to their importance, these cuts have been extensively studied, both theoretically (Andersen, Cornuéjols, and Li, 2005b; Basu, Cornuéjols, and Margot, 2012; Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990) and computationally (Balas, Ceria, Cornuéjols, and Natraj, 1996; Balas and Saxena, 2008; Bonami, 2012; Dash and Goycoolea, 2010; Fischetti and Salvagnin, 2011; 2013).An important tool for the cut generating function approach has been the study of finite and infinite dimensional corner relaxations. Corner relaxations retain enough of the complexity of mixed-integer programs to be extremely useful models for obtaining general cutting planes, and yet have a structure that yields to mathematical analysis and a beautiful theory has been built about them (Conforti, Cornuéjols, and Zambelli, 2011a).In Section 1.1, we formally define the main objects of study of this paper, and then follow up with a statement of our results in Section 1.2.Given a pointf∈[0,1]n∖Znand setsR,Q⊆Rn(not necessarily finite), define the (n-row) generalized corner relaxationC=C(f,R,Q)as the set solutions (x, s, y) to the system(C(f,R,Q))x=f+∑r∈Rr·s(r)+∑q∈Qq·y(q)x∈Zny(q)∈Z∀q∈Qs∈R+(R),y∈R+(Q),whereR+(S)denotes the set of non-negative functionsf:S→R+with finite support. This model was first introduced by Johnson (1974). When R and Q are finite subsets ofRn,the above problem is referred to as the mixed-integer corner polyhedron.We define the continuous corner relaxationCC(f,R,Q)obtained from (C(f,R,Q)) by dropping the integrality constraint on the y variables, i.e., all points (x, s, y) that satisfy the first, second and fourth constraints. We useCLP(f,R,Q)to denote the linear relaxation ofC(f,R,Q),namely the set of points (x, s, y) that satisfy the first and fourth set of constraints in (C(f,R,Q)). Thus we have thatC(f,R,Q)⊆CC(f,R,Q)⊆CLP(f,R,Q).A valid cut or valid function forC(f,R,Q)(orCC(f,R,Q)) is a pair of non-negative functions(ψ,π)∈R+R×R+Q(whereR+Sdenotes the set of functions from S toR+) such that for every(x,s,y)∈C(f,R,Q)(or(x,s,y)∈CC(f,R,Q)respectively) we have(1)∑r∈Rψ(r)s(r)+∑q∈Qπ(q)y(q)≥1.We will associate the function pair (ψ, π) with the cut defined by the above inequality. With slight abuse of notation, we may use (ψ, π) to denote the set of points satisfying (1) (e.g.,CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π)).Also with slight overload in notation, given sets R′⊇R and Q′⊇Q and functionsψ∈RR′andπ∈RQ′,we say that (ψ, π) is a valid cut/function forC(f,R,Q)if the restriction (ψ|R, π|Q) is valid for it. Notice that if (ψ, π) is valid forC(f,R′,Q′),then it is valid for the restrictionC(f,R,Q).We define a family of cut-generating functions for the n-row corner relaxation, that we call α-cuts, which is a natural higher-dimensional generalization of k-cuts (Cornuéjols et al., 2003). Informally, an α-cut for an n-row corner relaxation is obtained by taking an integer vectorα∈Zn,aggregating the n rows of the problem using the α’s as multipliers and then employing the GMI function to the resulting equality.Given a real numbera∈R,let [a] denote its fractional part a − ⌊a⌋. Then givenf∈R,the GMI function(ψGMIf,πGMIf)is defined as(2)ψGMIf(r)=max{r1−[f],−r[f]},πGMIf(q)=max{[q]1−[f],1−[q][f]}.The GMI function is valid for the infinite corner relaxationC(f,R,R)(n = 1).Forf∈[0,1]n∖Zn,define the setsZf={w∈Zn:fw∉Z}. Givenα∈Zf,we define the α-cut function(ψαf,παf)is defined as(3)ψαf(r)=ψGMIαf(αr),παf(q)=πGMIαf(αq).We make the observation here thatψGMI−f(−r)=ψGMIf(r)and similarly,πGMI−f(−q)=πGMIf(q)(since [ − a] = 1 − [a]). Therefore,ψ−αf=ψαfandπ−αf(q)=παf(q),and one needs only considerα∈Zflying on one side of any halfspace inRn. In the case n = 1, the α-cut functions correspond to the k-cuts introduced in Cornuéjols et al. (2003).Consider an n-dimensional corner relaxationC(f,R,Q). Givenα∈Zfandβ:Q→Z,we define the split disjunctionD(α,β,f)≜{(x,s,y):αx+∑q∈Qβ(q)y(q)≤⌊αf⌋}∪{(x,s,y):αx+∑q∈Qβ(q)y(q)≥⌈αf⌉}.A cut (ψ, π) is a split cut forC(f,R,Q)with respect to the disjunction D(α, β, f) if it is satisfied by all points in the setCLP(f,R,Q)∩D(α,β,f).11Notice that we only consider α inZf,and not inZn,because in the latter caseCLP(f,R,Q)∩D(α,β,f)=CLP(f,R,Q).We analogously define split cuts forCC(f,R,Q). For that, givenα∈Zf,define the split disjunctionD¯(α,f)={(x,s,y):αx≤⌊αf⌋}∪{(x,s,y):αx≥⌈αf⌉}.The cut (ψ, π) is a split cut forCC(f,R,Q)with respect to the disjunctionD¯(α,f)if it is satisfied by all points inCLP(f,R,Q)∩D¯(α,f).Notice that these definitions hold for the case where R and/or Q are infinite, thus generalizing the standard definition of split cuts to this setting.We show that the α-cuts give all the split cuts for a generalized mixed-integer corner relaxation, which includes both the finite and infinite dimensional relaxations.Theorem 1Consider an n-row generalized corner relaxationC. Then the α-cuts are exactly the split cuts forC. More precisely, every α-cut is a split cut forCand every split cut forCis dominated by an α-cut.In particular, this result directly gives the equivalence between k-cuts and split cuts for the 1-row (finite or infinite dimensional) corner relaxations.The proof of Theorem 1 is based on geometric lifting, a technique introduced in Conforti, Cornuéjols, and Zambelli (2011b). The cut-generating functions that we obtain can also be derived using the formulas from Section 2.4 of Andersen et al. (2005a). However, in our opinion, our geometric viewpoint illuminates aspects of these cut generating functions that are not immediately apparent if one uses the algebraic approach of Andersen et al. (2005a). We illustrate this advantage using two applications: Theorems 2 and 3 below.It is known that every cut for the finite-dimensional corner relaxation is a restriction of a cut for the infinite relaxation. We show that, not only does the infinite relaxation encode all finite-dimensional corner relaxations and valid cuts for them, but it also preserves the structure of split cuts.Theorem 2Consider a non-empty n-row generalized corner relaxationC(f,R,Q). Then a valid cut forC(f,R,Q)is a split cut if and only if it is the restriction of a split cut for the infinite relaxationC(f,Rn,Rn).This result relies on the fact that the characterization of Theorem 1 holds for the infinite relaxation.In addition, we use insights obtained from this characterization to better understand the strength of split cuts. Cook et al. (1990) constructed an example of a mixed-integer program with infinite split rank. Reinforcing the potential weakness of the split closure, Basu, Bonami, Cornuéjols, and Margot (2011) constructed mixed-integer programs whose split closures provide an arbitrarily weak approximation to their integer hull. On the other hand, it is known that every pure-integer program (where all variables are integer valued) has finite split rank (Chvátal, 1973). Nonetheless, in our final contribution we construct an explicit family of pure-integer programs whose split closure is arbitrarily bad compared to the integer hull.Theorem 3For every rational ε > 0, there is a pure-integer corner relaxationCϵ⊆R3whose split closureSCϵhas the property thatmin{y1+y2:(x,y1,y2)∈Cϵ}min{y1+y2:(x,y1,y2)∈SCϵ}≥112ϵ.Mixed-integer rounding (equivalently, the Gomory mixed-integer) functions can be seen as a family of cut generating functions that completely describe all split cuts for finite-dimensional mixed-integer corner polyhedra (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990). MIR functions are parametrized by tuples of rational numbers; in contrast, our α-cuts are parameterized by tuples of integers. This property ascribes an additional simplicity on the cut-generating functions that we obtain.Now we define the crucial concept of lattice-free cuts. First, given a convex bodyS⊆Rncontaining the origin in its interior, define the function(4)γS(r)=inf{1λ>0:λr∈S}.A convex bodyS⊆Rnis said to be lattice-free ifZn∩int(S)=∅. Given a lattice-free convex bodyS⊆Rncontaining f in its interior, we define the function (ψS, πS) by setting ψS(r) = πS(r) = γS − f(r) for allr∈Rn. The cut (ψS, πS) is valid forCC(f,Rn,Rn). We call these lattice-free cuts.We define a class of lattice-free cuts using a special kind of lattice-free convex set. Given an integer vectorα∈Zn,we define the lattice-free split S(α, f) asS(α,f)={x∈Rn:⌊αf⌋≤αx≤⌈αf⌉}.The set S(α, f) is convex and lattice-free, and notice that wheneverα∈Zfit contains f in its interior; in this case, (ψS(α, f), πS(α, f)) is a valid cut forCC(f,R,Q). We call this cut a lattice-free split cut.To simplify the notation defineS¯(α,f)=S(α,f)−fas the “centered” version of S(α, f), so thatψS(α,f)=πS(α,f)=γS¯(α,f). It is well-known thatγS¯(α,f)(and thus ψS(α, f) and πS(α, f)) are sublinear functions, i.e.,γS¯(α,f)(0)=0,γS¯(α,f)(r1+r2)≤γS¯(α,f)(r1)+γS¯(α,f)(r2)for allr1,r2∈Rn,andγS¯(α,f)(tr)=tγS¯(α,f)(r)for allt∈Randr∈Rn.We will use the fact that, for the continuous corner relaxation, split and lattice-free split cuts are equivalent. The finite-dimensional version of this result is due to Balas (1971) (see also Section 4.9 in Cornuéjols (2008)).Theorem 4For any continuous corner relaxationCC(f,R,Q)andα∈Zn,CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψS(α,f),πS(α,f))=conv(CLP(f,R,Q)∩D¯(α,f)).For ease of notation, we denoteCLP=CLP(f,R,Q),S = S(α, f) andS¯=S¯(α,f)in the remainder of this proof.(⊇)SinceCLP∩(ψS,πS)is convex, it suffices to show thatCLP∩D¯(α,f)⊆CLP∩(ψS,πS); so it suffices to show thatCLP∩D¯(α,f)satisfies (ψS, πS).Take(x¯,s¯,y¯)∈CLP∩D¯(α,f). Suppose by contradiction that(5)∑r∈Rs¯rψS(r)+∑q∈Qy¯qπS(q)<1.Using the sublinearity ofγS¯(α,f)=ψS=πSand the fact thats¯andy¯have finite support, we obtain from (5) thatγS¯(α,f)(∑r∈Rs¯rr+∑q∈Qy¯qq)<1.SinceγS¯(α,f)is the Minkowski functional ofS¯,this shows thatx¯−f=∑r∈Rs¯rr+∑q∈Qy¯qq∈int(S¯). In other words,x¯∈int(S). This is a contradiction to the choice(x¯,s¯,y¯)∈CLP∩D¯(α,f).(⊆)Take a point(x¯,s¯,y¯)∈CLP∩(ψS,πS); we show that it belongs toconv(CLP∩D¯(α,f)).Let S(α, f) be a lattice-free split for someα∈Zf. Let r* be such that ψS(α, f)(r*) = πS(α, f)(r*) = 0. Then a pointx˜∈Rnbelongs toint(S(α,f))if and only ifx˜+r*belongs toint(S(α,f)).By definition S(α, f) = {x: ⌊αf⌋ ≤ αx ≤ ⌈αf⌉}. By definition of the Minkowski functional, ψS(α, f)(r*) = 0 implies that r* is in the recession cone of S(α, f). Thus, αr* = 0. Thenx˜belongs toint(S(α,f))iff⌊αf⌋<αx˜<⌈αf⌉,which happens iff⌊αf⌋<α(x˜+λr*)<⌈αf⌉for allλ∈R,which is equivalent to(x˜+λr*)∈int(S(α,f))for allλ∈R.□Define R′ = {r ∈ R: ψS(r) > 0} and Q′ = {q ∈ Q: πS(q) > 0}. Also defineλr=s¯rψS(r)for every r ∈ R andμq=y¯qπS(q)for every q ∈ Q, and letν=∑r∈R′λr+∑q∈Q′μq.Notice that since(x¯,s¯,y¯)satisfies (ψS, πS), we haveν=∑r∈R′λr+∑q∈Q′μq=∑r∈R′s¯rψS(r)+∑q∈Q′y¯qπS(q)=∑r∈Rs¯rψS(r)+∑q∈Qy¯qπS(q)≥1(the third equality follows from the fact that ψS(r) = 0 for all r ∈ R∖R′ and πS(q) = 0 for all q ∈ Q∖Q′, and the inequality follows from the fact that(x¯,s¯,y¯)satisfies (ψS, πS)). For every r ∈ R′, define the pointUr=(f+νrψS(r),(νψS(r))·1r,0)where 1rdenotes the indicator function of r. Letur=f+νrψS(r)be its first component; similarly, for every q ∈ Q′ defineVq=(f+νqπS(q),0,(νπS(q))·1q)and letvq=f+νqπS(q)be its first component.Notice that all Urand Vqbelong toCLP; moreover, using the definition of ψSand πSand the fact that ν ≥ 1, we have thatur∉int(S)andvq∉int(S)for all r ∈ R′ and q ∈ Q′. Therefore, the points Urand Vqbelong toCLP∩D¯(α,f).Now defineΔ=(∑r∈R∖R′s¯rr+∑q∈Q∖Q′y¯qq,s¯|R∖R′,y¯|Q∖Q′).Since ψS= πSare sublinear and nonnegative, we have that0≤ψS(∑r∈R∖R′s¯rr+∑q∈Q∖Q′y¯qq)≤∑r∈R∖R′s¯rψS(r)+∑q∈Q∖Q′y¯qπS(q)=0,where the equality follows from the fact that ψS(r) = 0 for all r ∈ R∖R′ and πS(q) = 0 for all q ∈ Q∖Q′. Thus, the value of ψSon the first component of Δ is zero. So Claim 1 implies thatUr+Δ∈CLP∩D¯(α,f)for all r ∈ R′ andVq+Δ∈CLP∩D¯(α,f)for all q ∈ Q′.Now notice that∑r∈R′λrν+∑q∈Q′μqν=1and we can write(x¯,s¯,y¯)as follows:(6)(x¯,s¯,y¯)=∑r∈R′λrνUr+∑q∈Q′μqνVq+Δ=∑r∈R′λrν(Ur+Δ)+∑q∈Q′μqν(Vq+Δ).Therefore,(x¯,s¯,y¯)belongs toconv(CLP∩D¯(α,f)).□The idea behind the lifting of cuts is to first obtain a (weaker) cut by ignoring some of the integrality of the variables and then strengthen it by incorporating back some of the discarded information. In our context, we can formally define lifting as follows: given a cut (ψ, π) valid forCC(f,R,Q),we say that a cut (ψ′, π′) valid forC(f,R,Q)is a lifting of (ψ, π) if ψ′ = ψ and π′ ≤ π. For example, the GMI function introduced in Section 1.1.1 can be seen as a lifting of a lattice-free cut, a fact that will be very important for our developments.Fact 1Conforti et al., 2011bThe GMI function(ψGMIf,πGMIf)is the lifting of the lattice-free cut (ψS(1, f), πS(1, f)). More precisely,ψGMIf(r)=ψS(1,f)(r),πGMIf(q)=minw∈ZπS(1,f)(q+w).We define a lifting procedure for lattice-free cuts. Given an integral functionℓ:Q→Zwe consider the program(CC(f0,R0,Qℓ))(xxn+1)=(f0)+∑r∈R(r0)·s(r0)+∑q∈Q(qℓ(q))·y(qℓ(q))x∈Znxn+1∈Zs∈R+(R0),y∈R+(Qℓ)where we define f0 = (f, 0), R0 = {(r, 0): r ∈ R} and Qℓ = {(q, ℓ(q)): q ∈ Q}.Intuitively,CC(f0,R0,Qℓ)is a relaxation ofC(f,R,Q)and hence valid cuts for the former should be valid for the latter. Indeed, it is easy to check that given a lattice-free setS⊆Rn+1containing (f, 0) in its interior, the cut(ψS+,πS+)given byψS+(r)=γS−f(r0)∀r∈R,πS,ℓ+(q)=γS−f(qℓ(q))∀q∈Qis valid forC(f,R,Q). Moreover, keeping the set S fixed, we can also look at the strongest possible cuts we can obtain by choosing different ℓ’s; more precisely, the function(ψ˜S,π˜S)given byψ˜S(r)=ψS+(r)=γS−f(r0)∀r∈R,π˜S(q)=inf{πS,ℓ+(q)∣ℓ:Q→Z}=inf{γS−f(qℓ(q)):ℓ(q)∈Z}∀q∈Qis valid forC(f,R,Q).The following technical lemma is well-known in the lifting literature.Lemma 1LetS=S(α,f)⊆Rnbe a lattice-free split set for someα∈Zf. Define π*(r) = ∈f{γS − f(r + w): w ∈ X}, where X is a subset ofZn. Then, there exists w* ∈ X such that π*(r) = γS − f(r + w*).It can be verified thatγS−f(r)=max{αr⌈αf⌉,−αrαf−⌊αf⌋}≜max{c1αr,−c2αr},see for instance Conforti et al. (2011b).For anyw∈X⊆Zn,there existsλ∈Randv∈Rnsuch that w = λα + v and α · v = 0. Thus, γS − f(r + w) = max {c1αr + c1λ‖α‖2, −c2αr − c2λ‖α‖2}. LetΛ={λ∈R:∃v∈Rnsuchthatλα+v∈X,αv=0}be the projection of theX⊆Znonto the subspace spanned by α; since α is rational, we have that Λ is a subset of a lattice. With this definition, we have(Cϵ)π*(r)=inf{γS−f(r+w):w∈X}=inf{max{c1αr+c1λ∥α∥2,−c2αr−c2λ∥α∥2}:λ∈Λ}.Now ω(λ)≜max {c1αr + c1λ‖α‖2, −c2αr − c2λ‖α‖2} is a piecewise linear convex function in λ with two pieces, and Λ is a subset of some lattice. Moreover, ω(λ) ≥ 0 for allλ∈R. Thus, the infimum in the right-hand side of (7) is actually achieved. This proves the lemma.□The main result in this section is the next lemma, which shows that every split cut forC(f,R,Q)can be obtained via geometric lifting from a cut derived from a lattice-free split set. We say that (ψ, π) dominates (ψ′, π′) with respect to a set X if X∩(ψ, π)⊆X∩(ψ′, π′).Lemma 2A valid cut (ψ, π) forC(f,R,Q)is a split cut iff there isα∈Zfsuch that (ψ, π) is dominated by the cut(ψ˜S,π˜S)with respect toCLP(f,R,Q),where S = S((α, 1), (f, 0)).The heart of the argument for proving Lemma 2 is showing the equivalence between split cuts forC(f,R,Q)andCC(f0,R0,Qℓ); the idea is that we can simulate any split disjunction for the former by setting the value of ℓ appropriately and using a disjunction on the latter program which utilizes the new constraintxn+1=∑q∈Qℓ(q)·y(qℓ(q)). To make this precise, define the functionΓℓ∘:RR×RQ→RR0×RQℓwhich maps (ψ, π) into(ψ^,π^)by settingψ^(r,0)=ψ(r)∀r∈R,π^(q,ℓ(q))=π(q)∀q∈Q,and the functionalΓℓ:CLP(f,R,Q)→CLP(f0,R0,Qℓ)which maps a solution (x, s, y) into (x′, s′, y′) by settingxi′=xi,i=1,2,…,nxn+1′=∑q∈Qℓ(q)y(q)s′(r,0)=s(r)forallr∈Ry′(q,ℓ(q))=y(q)forallq∈Q.The following can be readily verified.Observation 1Given any tuple(x,s,y)∈Rn×RR×RQ,we have:1.(x, s, y) is a solution toCLP(f,R,Q)iff Γℓ(x, s, y) is a solution toCLP(f0,R0,Qℓ).(x, s, y) satisfies the cut (ψ, π) if and only if Γℓ(x, s, y) satisfies the cutΓℓ∘(ψ,π).The cut (ψ, π) is a split cut forC(f,R,Q)with respect to the disjunction D(α, β, f) iffΓβ∘(ψ,π)is a split cut forCC(f0,R0,Qβ)with respect to the disjunctionD¯((α,1),(f,0)).Observe that (x, s, y) ∈ D(α, β, f) if and only ifΓβ(x,s,y)∈D¯((α,1),(f,0)). From Observation 1,(x,s,y)∈CLP(f,R,Q)if and only ifΓβ(x,s,y)∈CLP(f0,R0,Qβ). Thus,(x,s,y)∈CLP(f,R,Q)∩D(α,β,f)if and only ifΓβ(x,s,y)∈CLP(f0,R0,Qβ)∩D¯((α,1),(f,0)). By Observation 1, (ψ, π) is valid forCLP(f,R,Q)∩D(α,β,f)if and only ifΓβ∘(ψ,π)is valid forCLP(f0,R0,Qβ)∩D¯((α,1),(f,0)). Thus, we are done.□We also need the following easy lemma, which states thatΓℓ∘preserves cut dominance.Lemma 4Let (ψ, π) and (ψ′, π′) be valid cuts forC(f,R,Q). The cut (ψ, π) dominates (ψ′, π′) with respect toCLP(f,R,Q)iff the cutΓℓ∘(ψ,π)dominatesΓℓ∘(ψ′,π′)with respect toCLP(f0,R0,Qℓ).The cut (ψ, π) dominates (ψ′, π′) with respect toCLP(f,R,Q)iff every point(x,s,y)∈CLP(f,R,Q)satisfying (ψ, π) also satisfies (ψ′, π′); from Observation 1 this happens iff every point Γℓ(x, s, y) (for(x,s,y)∈CLP(f,R,Q)) satisfyingΓℓ∘(ψ,π)also satisfiesΓℓ∘(ψ′,π′); but this happens iff the cutΓℓ∘(ψ,π)dominatesΓℓ∘(ψ′,π′)with respect toCLP(f0,R0,Qℓ).□(⇒) Suppose that (ψ, π) is a split cut forC(f,R,Q)with respect to the disjunction D(α, β, f). By Lemma 3 we get that(ψ′,π′)=Γβ∘(ψ,π)is a split cut forCC(f0,R0,Qβ)with respect to the disjunctionD¯((α,1),(f,0)). From Theorem 4, we get that (ψ′, π′) is dominated by (ψS, πS) with respect toCLP(f0,R0,Qℓ). From Lemma 4 we then have that (ψ, π) is dominated by(Γβ∘)−1(ψS,πS)with respect toCLP(f,R,Q). Finally, notice that(Γβ∘)−1(ψS,πS)=(ψS+,πS,β+); since(ψ˜S,π˜S)is at least as strong as(ψS+,πS,β+),we have the first part of the lemma.(⇐) By Lemma 1,(ψ˜S,π˜S)=(ψS+,πS,ℓ+)for someℓ:Q→R. Thus, it suffices to show that for allℓ:Q→Zthe cut(ψS+,πS,ℓ+)is a split cut forC(f,R,Q). First notice that Theorem 4 implies that (ψS, πS) is a split cut forCC(f0,R0,Qℓ). Again since(ψS+,πS,ℓ+)=(Γℓ∘)−1(ψS,πS),Lemma 3 gives that(ψS,ℓ+,πS+)is a split cut forC(f,R,Q),thus concluding the proof of the lemma.□An important tool to connect the GMI and α-cuts with lattice-free split cuts forCC(f0,R0,Qℓ)is to understand how the latter change when we apply a linear transformation to the split sets used to generate them.The first observation follows directly from the definition of γS(.) in (4).Lemma 5Consider a convex setS⊆Rnwith the origin in its interior. Then for every linear transformationA:Rm→Rnwe haveγS(Ar)=γA−1(S)(r)for allr∈Rm.Now we see how the description of a centered splitS¯(u,f)changes when we apply a linear transformation to this set. To make this formal, given a linear mapA:Rm→Rn,we useAt:Rn→Rmto denote the adjoint of A (i.e., the unique linear map satisfying A(u) · v = u · At(v)).Lemma 6Consider a centered split setS¯(u,f)withu∈Znandf∈Rn,and a linear transformationA:Rm→Rn. Then for every vector f′ ∈ A−1(f), we haveA−1(S¯(u,f))=S¯(At(u),f′).Assume that A−1(f) is non-empty, otherwise there is nothing to prove, and consider f′ ∈ A−1(f). Recall thatS¯(u,f)=S(u,f)−f={x:⌊uf⌋≤u(x+f)≤⌈uf⌉}. Then we haveA−1(S¯(u,f))={x∈Rm:⌊uf⌋≤u·(A(x)+f)≤⌈uf⌉}={x∈Rm:⌊u·A(f′)⌋≤u·A(x+f′)≤⌈u·A(f′)⌉}={x∈Rm:⌊At(u)·f′⌋≤At(u)·(x+f′)≤⌈At(u)·f′⌉}=S¯(At(u),f′).□The next corollary states that we can use the geometric lifting to simulate the “trivial lifting” of a cut given by an interval, which is very handy given that we can construct the GMI function this way (recall Fact 1).Corollary 1For every centered split setS¯(u,f)⊆R1,we haveγS¯(u,f)(r+w)=γS¯((u,u),(f,0))(rw)∀r,w∈R.Let A be the linear map (x1, x2)↦x1 + x2 whose adjoint is x1↦(x1, x1), and let f′ = (f, 0); apply Lemmas 5 and 6.□In combination with the above result, the next corollary is useful to connect the definition of α-cuts with our geometric lifting.Corollary 2Considerf∈Rnand an integral vectorα∈Zf. ThenγS¯((1,1),(αf,0))(αqw)=γS¯((α,1),(f,0))(qw)∀q∈Rn,w∈R.Let A be the linear map(x1,x2,…,xn+1)↦(∑i=1nαixi,xn+1),whose adjoint is (x1, x2)↦(α1x1, α2x1, …, αnx1, x2), and let f′ = (f, 0); apply Lemmas 5 and 6.□Now we use the tools from the previous section to show that α-cuts forC(f,R,Q)are liftings of lattice-free split cuts forCC(f,R,Q). Notice the similarity of the statement below and Lemma 2, which shows that every split cut forC(f,R,Q)is a lifting of a lattice-free split cut forCC(f,R,Q); in fact, it is through these liftings of lattice-free split cuts that we can show the equivalence of α-cuts and split cuts forC(f,R,Q)in the sequel.Lemma 7For everyα∈Zf,the α-cut can be obtained using the geometric lifting procedure. More precisely, defining S = S((α, 1), (f, 0)) we have(ψαf,παf)=(ψ˜S,π˜S).Recall that from the definition of α-cuts and Fact 1 thatψαf(r)=ψGMIαf(αr)=γS¯(1,αf)(αr). Then using Corollary 1 with u = 1 and w = 0 and Corollary 2 with w = 0, we get thatψαf(r)=γS¯(1,αf)(αr)=Cor1γS¯((1,1),(αf,0))(αr0)=Cor2γS¯((α,1),(f,0))(r0)=ψ˜S((α,1),(f,0))(r).Similarly, recall thatπαf(q)=πGMIαf(αq)=minw∈ZψGMIαf(αq+w)=minw∈ZγS¯(1,αf)(αq+w).Then employing Corollaries 1 and 2 we get thatπαf(q)=minw∈ZγS¯(1,αf)(αq+w)=Cor1minw∈ZγS¯((1,1),(αf,0))(αqw)=Cor2minw∈ZγS¯((α,1),(f,0))(qw)=π˜S((α,1),(f,0))(q),concluding the proof of the lemma.□First we prove that every α-cut is a split cut forC(f,R,Q). Consider someα¯∈Zfand the cut(ψα¯f,πα¯f). From Lemma 7 we have that(ψα¯f,πα¯f)equals(ψ˜S,π˜S)forS=S((α¯,1),(f,0)). The validity of the latter forC(f,R,Q)then implies the validity of the former, and using the “if” part of Lemma 2 concludes the proof of this part.For the second part, consider a split cut (ψ, π) forC(f,R,Q). From Lemma 2 there exists α inZfsuch that (ψ, π) is dominated by(ψ˜S((α,1),(f,0)),π˜S((α,1),(f,0)))with respect toCLP(f,R,Q). By Lemma 7, this implies that (ψ, π) is dominated by(ψαf,παf)with respect toCLP(f,R,Q).We now use Theorem 1 to prove Theorem 2. Before we do so we need the following technical lemma that gives a more natural characterization of the domination relationship between valid cuts.Lemma 8Consider a non-empty corner relaxationC=C(f,R,Q). Let (ψ, π) and (ψ′, π′) be valid cuts forC. ThenCLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π)⊆CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ′,π′)⟺(ψ,π)≤(ψ′,π′).In other words, (ψ, π) dominates (ψ′, π′) with respect toCLP(f,R,Q)iff (ψ, π) ≤ (ψ′, π′).The “if” part is trivial, so we prove only the “only if” part. We prove the contrapositive: assume that(ψ,π)¬≤(ψ′,π′)and show thatCLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π)¬⊆CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ′,π′). We consider the case whereψ¬≤ψ′,the other one is analogous. So letr¯∈Rbe such thatψ(r¯)>ψ′(r¯).First consider the case whereψ′(r¯)≥0,and henceψ(r¯)>0. Then we construct the solution(x¯,s¯,y¯)=(f+1ψ(r¯)r¯,1r¯ψ(r¯),0),where1r¯:R→Ris the function taking value1r¯(r¯)=1and1r¯(r)=0for all other r. Notice that(x¯,s¯,y¯)belongs toCLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π)but not toCLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ′,π′). This concludes the proof in this case.Now consider the case whereψ′(r¯)<0. Let(x¯,s¯,y¯)be a feasible solution forC(f,R,Q); in particular we have(x¯,s¯,y¯)∈CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π). Now let λ > 0 and consider the solution(x′,s′,y′)=(x¯+λr¯,s¯+λ1r¯,y¯).Since valid functions are non-negative by assumption (and in particularψ(r¯)≥0), notice that we still have(x′,s′,y′)∈CLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ,π)for all λ ≥ 0. However, sinceψ′(r¯)<0,setting λ large enough gives that (x′, s′, y′) does not belong toCLP(f,R,Q)∩(ψ′,π′). This concludes the proof of the lemma.□Let (ψ, π) be a split cut forC(f,R,Q)≠∅. The second part of Theorem 1 guarantees that there isα¯∈Zfsuch that(ψα¯f|R,πα¯f|Q)dominates (ψ, π) with respect toCLP(f,R,Q). Lemma 8 above then gives that(ψα¯f|R,πα¯f|Q)≤(ψ,π).Then define the cut (ψ′, π′) forC(f,Rn,Rn)such that (ψ′|R, π′|Q) = (ψ, π) and(ψ′|R∖R,π′|R∖Q)=(ψα¯f|R∖R,πα¯f|R∖Q). We then have that: (i) (ψ′, π′) is a split cut forC(f,R,Q),because(ψ′,π′)≥(ψα¯f,πα¯f)and(ψα¯f,πα¯f)is a split cut forC(f,R,Q)(by the first part of Theorem 1); (ii) (ψ, π) is a restriction of (ψ′, π′). This concludes the proof of the theorem.□In this section we prove Theorem 3 by exhibiting a pure integer corner relaxation with a weak split closure; throughout, we will only work with corner relaxationsC(f,R,Q)where both R and Q are finite sets of rational vectors.Recall that the split closure of a corner relaxationC(f,R,Q),denoted bySC(f,R,Q),is the set of all points inCLP(f,R,Q)that satisfy all split cuts forC(f,R,Q). Using Theorem 1 we can describe this closure as(7)SC(f,R,Q)=CLP(f,R,Q)∩(⋂α∈Zf(ψαf,παf)).Now we present the family of integer corner polyhedron with a weak split closure. Consider the following family parameterized by a rational number ε > 0:{{\mathcal {C}_{\protect \epsilon }}}x=12+(12+ϵ2)y1+(12+ϵ)y2y1,y2≥0x,y1,y2∈Z.To make things more clear, we definef¯=1/2,q¯1=(12+ϵ2)andq¯2=(12+ϵ),so formallyCϵ=C(f¯,∅,{q¯1,q¯2}).LetSCϵdenote the split closure ofCϵ; we claim that there is a gap of 1/12ε between these two sets when minimizing y1 + y2, i.e., they satisfy Theorem 3. The intuition behind this construction is the following. The equivalence in Theorem 1, via Eq. (8) allows us to focus solely on understanding the effect of α-cuts on the above program. Since the latter only has integrally constrained non-basic variables, this means focusing on the functionsπαf¯. Observing the behavior of the functionπαf¯,we see that it essentially has “high” value (close to 1) for inputs close to 1/2; while this is not exactly true for largeα∈Zf¯,our particular choice ofq¯1andq¯2guarantees that one ofπαf¯(q¯1)orπαf¯(q¯2)is reasonably large for every choice ofα∈Zf¯.Lemma 9For every ε > 0, we have thatmax{παf¯(q¯1),παf¯(q¯2)}≥1/3for allα∈Zf¯.By our choice off¯=1/2,notice that for everyα∈Zf¯we have that the fractional part[αf¯]equals 1/2. Thus, using the definition ofπαf¯given by Eqs. (2) and (3), we get thatπαf¯takes the form(8)παf¯(q)={2[αq],if[αq]≤122−2[αq],if[αq]>12The next claim gives some control on the behavior of the fractional part[αq¯i].□For everyα∈Zf¯either[αq¯1]or[αq¯2]lies in the interval [1/6, 5/6].Takeα∈Zf¯. Sincef¯=12,α is an odd integer. Therefore, we have that[αq¯1]=[1/2+αϵ2]=[1/2+[αϵ2]]. Using the latter, it is easy to verify that[αq¯1]∈[1/6,5/6]if and only if [kε/2]∉(1/3, 2/3). Similarly, we have that[αq¯2]∈[1/6,5/6]if and only if [kε]∉(1/3, 2/3).To conclude the proof, it suffices to show that [αε/2] ∈ (1/3, 2/3) implies [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3). For that notice that when [αε/2] ∈ (1/3, 1/2], this implies [αε] ∈ (2/3, 1] and hence [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3). On the other hand, when [αε/2] ∈ [1/2, 2/3) we have [αε] ∈ [0, 1/3), again reaching the conclusion [αε]∉(1/3, 2/3).□Takeα∈Zf¯and use the above claim to get i ∈ {1, 2} such that[αq¯i]∈[1/6,5/6]. If[αq¯i]∈[1/6,1/2],then employing Eq. (9) we get thatπαf¯(q¯i)=2[αq¯i]≥1/3; if[αq¯i]∈[1/2,5/6],the same equation givesπαf¯(q¯i)=2−2[αq¯i]≥2−10/6=1/3. This concludes the proof of the lemma.Using the above lemma, we see that the point(x¯,y¯1,y¯2)given byy¯1=y¯2=3andx¯=f¯+q¯1y¯1+q¯2y¯2belongs to the linear relaxation of (Cϵ) and satisfies all α-cuts for it; therefore, this point belongs to the split closure ofSCϵ. This directly gives the following.Lemma 10The optimal value of minimizing y1 + y2 over the split closureSCϵis at most 6.Now in order to show the weakness of the split cuts, we show that the optimal value of minimizing y1 + y2 over the whole ofCϵis much larger.Lemma 11The optimal value of minimizing y1 + y2 overCϵis at least 1/2ε.We can rewrite the equation in (Cϵ) asx=12(1+y1+y2)+ϵ(y12+y2).Since for every solution inCϵwe havey1,y2∈Z+,this implies that12(1+y1+y2)∈Z+/2; since in such solution we also havex∈Z,this implies thatϵ(y1/2+y2)∈Z+/2. Moreover, we need to have one of y1 or y2 strictly positive (and the other non-negative), so the previous observation actually implies that ε(y1/2 + y2) ≥ 1/2 is satisfied by all feasible solutions. Such solutions then satisfy the weaker inequality y1 + y2 ≥ 1/2ε; this concludes the proof of the lemma.□Theorem 3 then follows directly from Lemmas 10 and 11.
