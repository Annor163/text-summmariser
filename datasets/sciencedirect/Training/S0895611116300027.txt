@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Cell segmentation is an important element of automatic cell analysis. This paper proposes a method to extract the cell nuclei and the cell boundaries of touching cells in low contrast images. First, the contrast of the low contrast cell images is improved by a combination of multiscale top hat filter and h-maxima. Then, a curvelet initialized level set method has been proposed to detect the cell nuclei and the boundaries. The image enhancement results have been verified using PSNR (Peak Signal to noise ratio) and the segmentation results have been verified using accuracy, sensitivity and precision metrics. The results show improved values of the performance metrics with the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The biological cell studies rely on the analysis of large cell clusters with the help of microscopy imaging [1,2]. When the goal is to study phenomena of the live cells, fluorescence microscopy is commonly used as it allows biologists to experiment on the live cells with high sensitivity and specificity. Cell image analysis provides information about the cell characteristics and the dynamic behavior of the cells. The complexity of performing the cell analysis increases in touching cell images. Manual processing of such data is time consuming and error prone, creating a demand for automated techniques [3,4]. Thus, automation of cell structure analysis is becoming a necessity for describing biological processes. Cell segmentation is a crucial and basic processing step in many biological image applications. Automatic segmentation of live cells is more time efficient as compared to time consuming manual processes. To segment different kinds of cell images perfectly, many segmentation methods have been reported in literature. In recent years, active contour model has gained much importance for image segmentation. Active contour model was first proposed in [5], in which the energy guided by the internal and external image forces is minimized. The limitation of this model is that it fails to give good results when the topology of the test structure changes.An extension of the active contour method was introduced to overcome its limitations. The improvement led to the level set method for capturing moving fronts [6], in which the interface is represented implicitly by its introduction into a domain of one higher dimension level set function. In the level set method, contours or surfaces are represented as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function, called a level set function. In image processing applications, the level set method was introduced independently by Caselles et al. [5] and Malladi et al. [6]. After the work by Osher and Sethian in [7], the level set method became well known and since then has been widely used in many applications. A desirable advantage of level set method is that the changes in topology of a surface can be tracked naturally. Another advantage is that there is no need to parametrize the points on the contour and the numerical computations can be performed on a fixed cartesian grid.Level set methods are broadly divided into two classes: edge based [5] and region based [7]. Region based level set methods have outperformed edge based models in terms of factors such as robustness to initial conditions and boundary leakage problems in images with weak edges [7]. But it is difficult to accurately initialize level sets. Liasis et al. [8] proposed K-means presegmentation algorithm to develop the initial contours. But the method incorporates subject knowledge prior to the application of Chan and Vese (CV) model [9]. Hence this algorithm is not time efficient. Ouyang et al. [10] proposed a fast marching based labeling approach and a modification of the signature function to eliminate the numerical instability. But this approach is computationally efficient only in a small range around the boundary data. Savelonas et al. [11] proposed an initialization of the level set by introducing a level-set surface of cones centered at regional intensity maxima positions but this initialization process used histogram equalization and morphological processing to further refine the results. Renbo et al. [12] proposed a fast and accurate initialization algorithm based on the vector distance transform, by propagating a vector with the coordinates of the nearest pixel of the object. A new labeling method, based on the flood fill, was proposed to separate the inside and outside of the 2D closed active contour. Inspired by Padfield et al. [13] Yang et al. [14] used wavelet initialized level set segmentation. As wavelets extract only horizontal, vertical and diagonal information of an image, these three directions were unable to capture image information in other directions. The motivation behind the proposed work is that as curvelets are capable of detecting image information along curves, extracting the curvelet coefficients at the desired scales and directions will help to initialize the level set model of the cell image more accurately.Most of the cell segmentation methods reported in literature give good results in images with no cell crowding, but fail to separate touching cell boundaries. Marker controlled watershed algorithm [15] used rule based criterion to merge oversegmented cell regions but human intervention is required to derive a generalized rule for merging the oversegmented regions. To segment clustered cells, a double threshold-based watershed was proposed in [16]. The algorithm also introduced a feedback loop to correct errors. This algorithm is based on the assumption that all cells are of same type. Kothari et al. [17] proposed a semiautomatic method for touching cell segmentation by introducing concavity detection at the cluster edges to find the overlapping region between two nuclei. As ellipse-fitting algorithm was also used to refine the results but the algorithm failed to accurately detect the cells of other shapes. Chen et al. [18] proposed a geodesic distance based clustering algorithm to segment densely touching cells which gives improved segmentation accuracy of the cell boundaries. But the algorithm incorporates an adaptive learning scheme to adjust the clustering centers.The proposed work attempts to segment touching cells using a curvelet initialized modified Chan Vese model.
