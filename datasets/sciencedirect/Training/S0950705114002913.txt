@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the construction industry, evaluating the financial status of a contractor is a challenging task due to the myriad of the input data as well as the complexity of the working environment. This article presents a novel hybrid intelligent approach named as Evolutionary Least Squares Support Vector Machine Inference Model for Predicting Contractor Default Status (ELSIM-PCDS). The proposed ELSIM-PCDS is established by hybridizing the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms. In this new paradigm, the SMOTE is specifically used to deal with the imbalanced classification problem. The LS-SVM acts as a supervised learning technique for learning the classification boundary that separates the default and non-default contractors. Additionally, the DE algorithm automatically searches for the optimal parameters of the classification model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the classification performance of the ELSIM-PCDS is better than that of other benchmark methods. Therefore, the proposed hybrid approach is a promising alternative for predicting contractor default status.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Construction contractors are vulnerable to financial distress or bankruptcy due to the complex and uncertain nature of the construction industry. Hence, the failure rate among construction companies often reaches a high level [1,2]. One of the main reasons behind this high level of business failure is the construction managers’ inadequate knowledge of financial management.Therefore, investigating business failures in construction industry is undoubtedly an important research area for comprehending financial health as well as forecasting the financial status of a construction company. In addition, it is necessary for governments, construction owners, lending institutions, surety underwriters, investors, prime contractors, and sub-contractors to early identify companies that have high risk of bankruptcy [3–5].In practice, the increase of project scale and technical complexity often lead to the collaboration of many contractors to accomplish a construction project. Thus, the cooperation among stakeholders in the industry is very crucial for achieving the project goal. Within this context, assessing financial status can provide an early warning mechanism for monitoring contractors’ financial performances [6].Some approaches have been applied to evaluate and forecast a company financial status. The previous methods include the multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) [7], the logistic regression (LR) [8], etc. The market-based approaches were also used to model financial behaviors including the Merton model [9], the barrier option model [10], and other integrated methods [11]. Notably, those aforementioned approaches employ the managerial and economic variables, which are subjective and qualitative, for assessing the financial solvency of companies. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been demonstrated to be a reliable approach for financial status appraisal. Artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been utilized for financial distress forecasting [12–14]. Previous researches [4,13] have shown that the ANN and the SVM can outperform the conventional LR and MDA approaches.Nevertheless, the implementations of the ANN and SVM algorithms are exposed to several drawbacks. The major disadvantage of the ANN approach is that its training process is achieved through a gradient descent algorithm on the error space, which can be very complex and may contain many local minima [15]. Meanwhile, SVM training process entails solving a quadratic programming problem subjected to inequality constraints. This means that the SVM training processes for large data sets require expensive computational costs [16].To overcome the drawbacks of the ANN and the SVM, the LS-SVM has been recently proposed by Suykens et al. [17]. The LS-SVM can be considered as an improved version of the SVM to alleviate the burden of computational expenses. In the LS-SVM’s training process, a least squares cost function is proposed to obtain a linear set of equations in the dual space. Consequently, to derive the solution, it is needed to solve a set of linear equations, instead of a quadratic programming problem as in the standard SVM. Moreover, this linear system can be efficiently solved by iterative methods such as the conjugate gradient algorithm [18]. Studies have been carried out to demonstrate the excellent generalization, prediction accuracy, and fast computation of the LS-SVM approach [19–23]. Nevertheless, the application of the LS-SVM in financial default prediction has not been investigated.Furthermore, it is worth noticing that the LS-SVM tuning parameters play an important role in the process of model establishment [17]. These parameters control the model’s complexity, and they should be determined properly. Herein, the main objective is to obtain a model that can explore the underlying input–output mapping relationship and is capable of yielding the best predictive performance on the new data [24]. In this study, the DE algorithm, a population-based stochastic search engine proposed by Storn and Price [25], is employed to achieve such objective.In addition, previous studies on default prediction of construction firms typically used the sample match method, which matches a set of defaulted companies with the same number or some multiple of healthy firms [8,26]. However, the sample match method may result in biased predictive results [27]. These biased results will lead to the untrustworthy predictions of sample data. To avoid such biases, some researches abandon the sample match method and put all available firm-years data to represent the financial condition of construction companies [4,11,28]. Nevertheless, this approach leads to the circumstance in which the number of non-defaulted samples greatly exceeds the number of defaulted samples. This circumstance is widely known as the class imbalance problem. Thus, an oversampling technique of defaulted samples based on the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) [29] is employed in this study to alleviate the aforementioned problem.Therefore, this study proposes to hybridize the SMOTE, LS-SVM, and DE algorithms to establish a novel contractor default status prediction model named as ELSIM-PCDS. The capability of the new model is compared with that of other AI approaches. The rest of this article is organized as follows. The second section reviews related literature on default status prediction, the LS-SVM, the DE, and the SMOTE. The third section presents the data collection process. The fourth section depicts the frameworks of the hybrid model. The fifth section reports the experimental result. The conclusion of this study is stated in the final section.
