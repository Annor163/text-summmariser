@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Group decision making is an active branch of modern decision science. As for a multiple attribute group decision making problem, the most important task for experts is to find the desirable alternative according to the decision information. Due to the increasing complexity and vagueness in the real life, the decision information is not always given in the form of numerical values. It is natural for experts to express their preference information with linguistic phrases. For example, linguistic labels like “Good”, “Poor” and “Fair” is often used to evaluate goods. In previous studies, many approaches was proposed to deal with linguistic multiple attribute group decision making problems [1–5].It was necessary for experts to aggregate the decision information into a collective value in the process of decision making. For this purpose, in the last decades, there has been an increase in study of linguistic aggregation operators. Xu [6] introduced the linguistic weighted averaging operator to deal with group decision making problems with linguistic preference relations. Herrera [7,8] developed a direct approach in group decision making using linguistic OWA operator. Xu [9] expanded the linguistic aggregation operators and gave some induced linguistic aggregation operators. Moreover, a linguistic hybrid arithmetic averaging operator is also defined to solve group decision making problems [10]. These linguistic aggregation operators have been widely applied in various areas [11–14]. Due to the discontinuity of the original linguistic label set, dealing with linguistic labels directly lead to the loss of linguistic information. However, this discontinuous characteristics was not considered in the above-mentioned aggregation operators. To avoid information losing and biased results, Herrera and Martinez [15] built a 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model to make decision effectively. Since this model was introduced, a number of linguistic aggregation operators such as 2-tuple linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator [15], 2-tuple linguistic ordered weighted geometric averaging operator [16], 2-tuple linguistic hybrid averaging operator [16], 2-tuple linguistic harmonic averaging operator [17], 2-tuple linguistic power aggregation operator [18] and induced 2-tuple linguistic generalized aggregation operator [19] have been proposed.In many situations, the experts may have vague knowledge about the attribute values, and cannot estimate their preference with an exact linguistic label, but with an interval linguistic label. Therefore, research in interval linguistic multiple attribute group decision making problems has great significance. However, all of above linguistic aggregation operators were fail in dealing with such situations. It is necessary to extend the above aggregation operators to accommodate the decision making problems under interval linguistic environment, which is also the focus of this study. The aggregation operators for interval linguistic multiple attribute group decision making have attracted a lot of attentions in the last few decades. Xu [20] developed the uncertain linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator and uncertain linguistic hybrid aggregation operator to multiple attribute group decision making. Based on the uncertain linguistic weighted geometric mean operator, uncertain linguistic ordered weighted geometric operator and induced uncertain linguistic ordered weighted geometric operator, Xu [21] built an approach to group decision making with uncertain multiplicative linguistic preference relations. Moreover, the induced uncertain linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator was proposed to deal with group decision making problems [22]. Wei [23] introduced the uncertain linguistic hybrid geometric mean operator to show the importance of the given arguments and its ordered positions. Peng et al. [24] studied the uncertain pure linguistic hybrid harmonic averaging operator and generalized interval aggregation operator for group decision making in uncertain pure linguistic environment. Lan et al. [25] gave the induced uncertain linguistic OWA operators based on the extended triangular conorm. Meng et al. [26] proposed some interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic Choquet operators by considering the interactive characteristics among elements. Wei et al. [27] studied the uncertain linguistic Bonferroni mean operators on the basis of Bonferroni mean and geometric Bonferroni mean. Liu and Yu [28] developed 2-dimension uncertain linguistic power generalized weighted aggregation operator to aggregate 2-dimension uncertain linguistic variables. Liu et al. [29] proposed some intuitionistic uncertain linguistic Heronian mean operators, and discussed special cases corresponding to the different parameter values. Nevertheless, these interval linguistic operators fail to take into account the discontinuity of original linguistic label set, and may cause information losing and biased results in the process of aggregation. To avoid the loss of interval linguistic information in decision making, it is very necessary to study the aggregation operators of interval linguistic information by 2-tuple representation model, which is also the advantage of this paper. Many interval 2-tuple linguistic aggregation operators have been introduced in the literatures. Zhang and Fan [30] presented the uncertain 2-tuple linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator to solve multiple attribute group decision making with uncertain linguistic information. Wang and Chen [31] transformed the linguistic variables into 2-tuple linguistic information, and utilized the weighted continuous ordered weighted operator to aggregate the interval linguistic labels. Zhang [32] developed a new score function and accuracy function for ranking interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic variables, and introduced the interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic weighted averaging operator and interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator in detail. Furthermore, Liu et al. [33] developed the application of interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator to material selection. However, the above-mentioned aggregation operators only focus on the independence of linguistic information, the interactive phenomenon among experts (or attributes) is seldom discussed. Although some aggregation operators based on Choquet integral take the interactive phenomenon into account, they cannot reflect the overall interaction among combinations. Accordingly, it is very necessary to develop an effective interactive aggregation operator for solving multiple attribute group decision making problems under interval linguistic environment.It is logical that the smaller deviation between input linguistic values and the aggregation result, the better aggregation method used will be. However, the existing linguistic aggregation operators pay very little attention to the accuracy degree between aggregation result and input linguistic values. Up to now, there is no aggregation operator developed for dealing with interval linguistic decision making problems, which consider the deviation between aggregation result and input linguistic values. Thus, it is necessary to pay more attention to this issue. As a widely used method in statistics, chi-square method evaluates the likelihood that observed data are different. The greater the chi-square value, the larger the deviation. Many methods have been studied for decision making based on chi-square deviation [34–36]. It has been pointed out that the chi-square deviation has better discriminating power than the relative deviation [37]. In this study, to minimize the deviation of aggregation results, a new optimal aggregation operator called the generalized interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley chi-square averaging (GILSCA) operator is proposed. The GILSCA operator considers the interactive phenomenon among experts (or attributes) by using fuzzy measure and Shapley value. To solve the fuzzy measure on attribute set or expert set, theλ-fuzzy measure is employed. 2-tuple linguistic representation is given to avoid the loss of interval linguistic information in process of aggregation. Meantime, some special cases and desirable properties of the GILSCA operator are studied. Additionally, some formulae and programming models are provided to determine theλ-fuzzy measure effectively. An approach to multiple attribute group decision making under interval linguistic environment is proposed in detail.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic concepts of fuzzy measure, 2-tuple linguistic representation and generalized aggregation operators. In Section 3, the GILSCA operator is defined based on Shapley value and optimal models. Some special cases and desirable properties of the GILSCA operator are studied. Section 4 establishes the GOGDM algorithm. The application of GOGDM algorithm in facility location selection problem is provided in Section 5. The comparison and result analysis are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of this paper.To facilitate future discussions, some basic concepts on generalized aggregation operator, 2-tuple linguistic representation and Shapley value are briefly introduced as follows.The generalized weighted averaging (GWA) operator was first presented by Yager [38] based on generalized mean, and can be expressed as follows.Definition 2.1A GWA operator of dimension n is a mappingGWA:(R+)n→R+, defined by a weighting vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)and a parameterσ∈R⧹{0}, according to the following formula:(1)GWA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑j=1nwjajσ1σ.The GWA operator contains some special kinds of well-known operators, such as weighted arithmetical averaging operator(σ=1), weighted geometric averaging operator(σ→0), weighted harmonic averaging operator(σ=-1).As an effective method, chi-square deviation model has better discriminating power than other deviation-based methods, and has attracted more and more attentions. To select a desirable aggregation operator, Zhou et al. [39] developed the generalized weighted multiple averaging (GWMA) operator by constructing a deviation model as follows:(2)minZ=∑j=1nwjajyσ+yajσ-2,wherewjis the weight of argumentajsuch thatwj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nwj=1.y=f(a1,a2,…,an),fis the optimal mapping derived from Eq. (2). Furthermore, an explicit expression of y is obtained as(3)y=∑j=1nwjajσ1σ·∑j=1nwjaj-σ-1σ,which called the GWMA operator of dimension n.S={s1,s2,…,st}is a linguistic label set with odd cardinality, the cardinality of S means the number of elements in linguistic label set.sidenotes a possible value for a linguistic variable,i=1,2,…,t. For example, a linguistic label set with five labels can be expressed byS={s1:VeryPoor,s2:Poor,s3:Medium,s4:Good,s5:VeryGood}.Apparently, the middle label indicates an assessment of “Medium”, and the rest labels are placed symmetrically around it. It is worth to point out that the following characteristics should be satisfied for the linguistic label set S[6]:(1)Linearly ordered:si>sj, ifi>j.Maximum operator:max(si,sj)=siifsi⩾sj.Minimum operator:min(si,sj)=siifsi⩽sj.Assumeδis the operational result of the indexes of a set of labels in S. It is clear that1⩽δ⩽t(t is the cardinality ofS). Denotingi=round(δ)andθ=δ-iwith1⩽i⩽tand-0.5⩽θ<0.5, thenθis called a symbolic translation. To preserve linguistic information in the operational process, the original linguistic label setS={s1,s2,…,st}is extended to a virtual linguistic label setS‾={s1,s2,…,sT}. T is a sufficiently large positive integer. The original linguistic label set S is employed to evaluate attribute values by experts, and the virtual linguistic label setS‾can only appear in operations. Since S is a discrete set, it is hard to describe the meaning of linguistic information in operations. To avoid the loss of information in operations, a 2-tuple(si,θ)withsi∈S‾and-0.5⩽θ<0.5is given to denote the linguistic information.Definition 2.2Letδ∈[1,T]be the operational result of the indexes of a set of labels in S, then 2-tuple linguistic representation ofδis defined by the functionΔ:[1,T]→S‾×[-0.5,0.5), shown as follows [15]:(4)Δ(δ)=(si,θ),wherei=round(δ),θ=δ-i.round(·)is the usual round operation.A functionΔ-1:S‾×[-0.5,0.5)→[1,T]returns 2-tuple linguistic information to its equivalent numerical value is defined as [15](5)Δ-1(si,θ)=i+θ=δ.Note thatsi∈Scan be converted into a 2-tuple linguistic information(si,0). In this paper, the set of all 2-tuple linguistic information is defined byΩ.The order relationship between any two 2-tuple linguistic variables is defined by Herrera and Martinez [15], shown as follows.Let(si,θ1)and(sj,θ2)be two 2-tuple linguistic variables, then(1)Ifi>j, then(si,θ1)is bigger than(sj,θ2).Ifi=j, then(a)Ifθ1>θ2, then(si,θ1)is bigger than(sj,θ2).Ifθ1=θ2, then(si,θ1)and(sj,θ2)denote the same linguistic information.As a valid tool in dealing with the interactive phenomenon, fuzzy measures have been studied by many scholars [40].Definition 2.5A set functionμ:P(N)={S|S⊆N}→[0,1]called a fuzzy measure, satisfying(1)μ(∅)=0,μ(N)=1.∀A,B∈P(N), ifA⊆Bthenμ(A)⩽μ(B).It is difficult to derive the fuzzy measure of each combination of a set when its cardinality is large. In order to reduce the complexity of this problem, a special kind of fuzzy measure named theλ-fuzzy measure [40] is introduced as follows:(6)gλ(A∪B)=gλ(A)+gλ(B)+λgλ(A)gλ(B),whereA,B⊆N,A∩B=∅andλ>-1.It is well-known that (1) whenλ>0, thengλis a superadditive measure; (2) when-1<λ<0, thengλis a subadditive measure; (3) whenλ=0, thengλis an additive measure, which indicates that there is no interaction between coalitions A and B. Furthermore, Sugeno [40] pointed out that for each coalition A theλ-fuzzy measuregλcan be equivalently written as(7)gλ(A)=1λ∏i∈A(1+λgλ({i}))-1,λ≠0;∑i∈Agλ({i}),λ=0,whereλcan be determined by the following equation(8)∏i∈N(1+λgλ({i}))=λ+1.Shapley value [41] is a widely used solution concept for cooperative games, which is a vectorSh(N,μ)=(Sh1(N,μ),Sh2(N,μ),…,Shn(N,μ))and its components are defined by(9)Shi(N,μ)=∑T:i∈T⊆N(|T|-1)!(|N|-|T|)!|N|![μ(T)-μ(T⧹{i})],∀i∈N,whereμis a fuzzy measure onN,|N|and|T|are the cardinality of set N and T respectively. From Eq. (9), we know thatShi(N,μ)indicates the weighted averaging value of the marginal contribution with respect to player i.Letμbe a superadditive (or additive) fuzzy measure on N. Since fuzzy measureμis superadditive (or additive), it follows thatμ(T)⩾μ(T⧹{i})for alli∈T⊆N. Thus, by Eq. (9) we have(10)Shi(N,μ)⩾0.Moreover,(11)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)=μ(N)=1.From Eqs. (10) and (11),Sh(N,μ)is a weighting vector. Clearly, ifgλis a superadditive (or additive)λ-fuzzy measure on N, thenSh(N,gλ)is a weighting vector.It is natural to decision makers to express their opinion by linguistic labels. In many practical situations, decision makers evaluate the attributes by using the form of uncertain linguistic variables due to time pressure, lack of knowledge and complexity of society. Letãi=[(sli,θli),(sri,θri)]be an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable,li,ri∈{1,2,…,t}andθli,θri∈[-0.5,0.5)fori=1,2,…,n. The important task is to find a collective interval 2-tuple linguistic valueỹ=[(sl,θl),(sr,θr)]with respect to the collection of interval 2-tuple linguistic variablesã1,ã2,…,ãnvia an appropriate aggregation operator. It is logical that the smaller deviation betweenã1,ã2,…,ãnand the aggregation resultỹ, the better aggregation method used will be. Accordingly, the following optimal chi-square programming is developed to minimize the deviation betweenãj(j=1,2,…,n)andỹ.(12)minJ1=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sli,θli))f(Δ-1(sl,θl))σ-12f(Δ-1(sli,θli))f(Δ-1(sl,θl))σ,(13)minJ2=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sri,θri))f(Δ-1(sr,θr))σ-12f(Δ-1(sri,θri))f(Δ-1(sr,θr))σ,whereσ∈R⧹{0}is a parameter,Sh(N,μ)=(Sh1(N,μ),Sh2(N,μ),…,Shn(N,μ))is the Shapley weighting vector ofã1,ã2,…,ãn,f:[1,T]→[0,+∞)is a increasing, differentiable and invertible function. In group decision making problems, function f can be determined according to decision makers’ overall risk attitude. For example,f(x)=ex,f(x)=lnxandf(x)=xmay be selected corresponding to risk proneness, risk aversion and risk neutralness, respectively. Furthermore, Eqs. (12) and (13) can be equivalently written as(14)minJ1=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sli,θli))f(Δ-1(sl,θl))σ+f(Δ-1(sl,θl))f(Δ-1(sli,θli))σ-2,(15)minJ2=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sri,θri))f(Δ-1(sr,θr))σ+f(Δ-1(sr,θr))f(Δ-1(sri,θri))σ-2.Taking the partial derivative ofJ1andJ2with respect toΔ-1(sl,θl)andΔ-1(sr,θr)respectively, we have∂J1∂(Δ-1(sl,θl))=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)σ·f(Δ-1(sli,θli))f(Δ-1(sl,θl))σ-1·-f(Δ-1(sli,θli))(f(Δ-1(sl,θl)))2·df(Δ-1(sl,θl))d(Δ-1(sl,θl))+σ·f(Δ-1(sl,θl))f(Δ-1(sli,θli))σ-1·1f(Δ-1(sli,θli))·df(Δ-1(sl,θl))d(Δ-1(sl,θl)),∂J2∂(Δ-1(sr,θr))=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)σ·f(Δ-1(sri,θri))f(Δ-1(sr,θr))σ-1·-f(Δ-1(sri,θri))(f(Δ-1(sr,θr)))2·df(Δ-1(sr,θr))d(Δ-1(sr,θr))+σ·f(Δ-1(sr,θr))f(Δ-1(sri,θri))σ-1·1f(Δ-1(sri,θri))·df(Δ-1(sr,θr))d(Δ-1(sr,θr)).By setting∂J1∂(Δ-1(sl,θl))=0and∂J2∂(Δ-1(sr,θr))=0, we get(16)Δ-1(sl,θl)=f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ,(17)Δ-1(sr,θr)=f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.Theorem 3.1Letãi=[(sli,θli),(sri,θri)]be an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable,(i=1,2,…,n), thenỹ=Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ,Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σis also an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable.DenotingH=f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))-σ12σ, it follows thatlnf(H)=12σln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))σ-ln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))-σ.Taking the partial derivation oflnf(H)with respect tohi, we have∂(lnf(H))∂hi=12σShi(N,μ)·σ·(f(hi))σ-1·f′(hi)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))σ-Shi(N,μ)·(-σ)(f(hi))-σ-1·f′(hi)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))-σ=12Shi(N,μ)·f′(hi)·(f(hi))σ-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))σ+(f(hi))-σ-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(hi))-σ.From mappingf:[1,T]→[0,+∞), we getf(hi)⩾0. Since function f is increasing, we havef′(hi)⩾0. Based on Theorem 2.1, the Shapley weightShi(N,μ)⩾0. Therefore, we get∂(lnf(H))∂hi⩾0. It means thatlnf(H)is increasing with respect tohi(i=1,2,…,n). Clearly,f(H)is also increasing with respect tohi(i=1,2,…,n).Sinceãi=[(sli,θli),(sri,θri)]is an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable, we haveΔ-1(sri,θri)⩾Δ-1(sli,θli)fori=1,2,…,n. Thus, we obtain∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ⩽∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.Furthermore, functionf-1is increasing, we havef-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ⩽f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.By Definition 2.4, we haveΔf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ⩽Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.Moreover,f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ=f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ·(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))2σ12σ⩾f-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ·(f(1))2σ12σ=f-1(f(1))2σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ=f-1(((f(1))2σ)12σ)=1.Therefore,Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ⩾s1.In sum,ỹis an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable. □Based on the analysis of Theorem 3.1, the optimal aggregation resultỹis called the generalized interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley chi-square averaging (GILSCA) operator. In the following, for omitting the notationỹ, we denote the GILSCA operator as(18)GILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ,Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.To simplify the structure of the GILSCA operator, the following equivalent expression is introduced in detail. If we denote(19)B̂il=B̂il(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Shi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ,(20)B̂ir=B̂ir(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Shi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ.Then, it holds that∑i=1nB̂il=1and∑i=1nB̂ir=1. The GILSCA operator can be equivalently written as(21)GILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∑i=1nB̂il(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))2σ12σ,Δf-1∑i=1nB̂ir(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))2σ12σ.It is clear that interval 2-tuple linguistic variables lead to greater complexity and difficulty in comparison and ranking than crisp 2-tuple linguistic variables. To facilitate further analysis, the order relationships between any two interval 2-tuple linguistic variables should be introduced. Letã1=[(sl1,θl1),(sr1,θr1)]andã2=[(sl2,θl2),(sr2,θr2)]be two interval 2-tuple linguistic variables, if(sl1,θl1)⩽(sl2,θl2)and(sr1,θr1)⩽(sr2,θr2), thenã2is said to be strong superior toã1, denoted byã1≺sã2orã2≻sã1. To rank interval 2-tuple linguistic variables in more general cases, another order relationship should be considered here. Wang et al. [42] proposed a possibility-degree formula for ranking interval numbers. Motivated by their idea, a possibility-degree formula between two interval 2-tuple linguistic variables is given as follows:(22)p(ã2⩾ã1)=max{Δ-1(sr2,θr2)-Δ-1(sl1,θl1),0}-max{Δ-1(sl2,θl2)-Δ-1(sr1,θr1),0}Δ-1(sr1,θr1)+Δ-1(sr2,θr2)-Δ-1(sl1,θl1)-Δ-1(sl2,θl2).Ifp(ã2⩾ã1)⩾0.5, thenã2is said to be superior toã1, denoted byã1≺ã2orã2≻ã1. Note thatp(ã2⩾ã1)+p(ã1⩾ã2)=1always holds. Thus,p(ã2⩾ã1)⩽0.5indicates thatã1≻ã2orã2≺ã1.The following theorem shows that the monotonicity ofB̂ilandB̂irare determined by the sign symbol of parameterσ.Theorem 3.2Letãi=[(sli,θli),(sri,θri)]be an interval 2-tuple linguistic variable,(i=1,2,…,n). Then, according to the strong order of interval 2-tuple linguistic values, we have(1)Ifσ>0, thenB̂ilandB̂irare monotonically decreasing with respect toãi.Ifσ<0, thenB̂ilandB̂irare monotonically increasing with respect toãi.Taking the derivative ofB̂ilandB̂irwith respect toΔ-1(sli,θli)andΔ-1(sri,θri)respectively, we have∂B̂il∂(Δ-1(sli,θli))=Shi(N,μ)·(-σ)·(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ-1f′(Δ-1(sli,θli))∑j≠iShj(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(slj,θlj)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ2,∂B̂ir∂(Δ-1(sri,θri))=Shi(N,μ)·(-σ)·(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ-1f′(Δ-1(sri,θri))∑j≠iShj(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(srj,θrj)))-σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ2.Since function f is monotonically increasing, we havef′(Δ-1(sli,θli))⩾0andf′(Δ-1(sri,θri))⩾0. Moreover, function f is non-negative andShi(N,μ)⩾0, then(1)Ifσ>0, we have(23)∂B̂il∂(Δ-1(sli,θli))⩽0and∂B̂ir∂(Δ-1(sri,θri))⩽0.Letãi=[(sli,θli),(sri,θri)]andãi′=[(sli′,θli′),(sri′,θri′)]be two interval 2-tuple linguistic variables,(i=1,2,…,n).

It means that the aggregation results are in agreement with the risk preference function f defined above.It is worth to point out that the GILSCA operator includes some special operators as follows:(1)when the weights of players (decision makers or attributes) are indifferent and independent, thenSh(N,μ)=1n,1n,…,1nis selected, we haveGILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∑i=1n(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1n(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ,Δf-1∑i=1n(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1n(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ.This becomes the generalized interval 2-tuple linguistic chi-square averaging (GILCA) operator.whenσ=1, thenGILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sli,θli))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)1f(Δ-1(sli,θli))12,Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sri,θri))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)1f(Δ-1(sri,θri))12.This becomes the interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley chi-square averaging (ILSCA) operator.whenσ→0, it follows thatlimσ→0ln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ=limσ→012σln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ-ln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ=limσ→012∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ-∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))·(-1)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ=12∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)+∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli))).Similarly, we havelimσ→0ln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ=limσ→012σln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ-ln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ=limσ→012∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ-∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))·(-1)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ=12∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)+∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)=∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri))).In sum, forσ→0, it holds that∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ=e∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))=∏i=1n(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))Shi(N,μ)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ=e∑i=1nShi(N,μ)ln(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))=∏i=1n(f(Δ-1(sri,θri)))Shi(N,μ).Therefore, the GILSCA operator reduces to the following interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley geometric averaging (ILSGA) operator.ILSGA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∏i=1n(f(Δ-1(sli,θli)))Shi(N,μ),Δf-1∏i=1nf(Δ-1(sri,θri))Shi(N,μ).whenσ=12, the GILSCA operator reduces to the following interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley square-root chi-square averaging (ILSSCA) operator.ILSSCA=(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sli,θli))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)1f(Δ-1(sli,θli)),Δf-1∑i=1nShi(N,μ)f(Δ-1(sri,θri))∑i=1nShi(N,μ)1f(Δ-1(sri,θri)).whenf(x)=ex,f(x)=lnxandf(x)=xare selected according to decision makers’ overall risk attitudes, then the GILSCA operator reduces to the following three operators with respect to risk proneness, risk aversion and risk neutralness, respectively.GILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)eσΔ-1(sli,θli)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)e-σΔ-1(sli,θli)12σ,Δln∑i=1nShi(N,μ)eσΔ-1(sri,θri)∑i=1nShi(N,μ)e-σΔ-1(sri,θri)12σ,GILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δe∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(ln(Δ-1(sli,θli)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(ln(Δ-1(sli,θli)))-σ12σ,Δe∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(ln(Δ-1(sri,θri)))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(ln(Δ-1(sri,θri)))-σ12σ,GILSCA(ã1,ã2,…,ãn)=Δ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(Δ-1(sli,θli))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(Δ-1(sli,θli))-σ12σ,Δ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(Δ-1(sri,θri))σ∑i=1nShi(N,μ)(Δ-1(sri,θri))-σ12σ.ifShi(N,μ)=1andShj(N,μ)=0for allj≠i(in the setting of cooperative games, it means that for all coalitionS,j∈S,μ(S)=μ(S⧹{j})holds.

Moreover,μis a fuzzy measure, we haveμ({j})⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.

To do this, in the following some formulae are given to obtain theλ-fuzzy measure of each expert. The deviation between interval linguistic decision matricesZ̃kandZ̃pis given by(25)dkp=d(Z̃k,Z̃p)=∑i=1m∑j=1n|lijk-lijp|+|rijk-rijp|2mn(t-1),k,p∈{1,2,…,q}.It is clear thatdkp=dpkfor allk,p∈{1,2,…,q}. Especially, ifk=p, thendkp=0. Accordingly, the total deviation of interval linguistic decision matrixZ̃kis defined as(26)dk=∑p=1qdkp=∑p=1q∑i=1m∑j=1n|lijk-lijp|+|rijk-rijp|2mn(t-1),k∈{1,2,…,q}.Apparently, the smaller thedk, the greater measure valueekis. Thus, theλ-fuzzy measure of each expert is defined as(27)gλe({ek})=Mdk,k=1,2,…,q,where positive number M is sufficiently small and is determined by experts such that∑k=1qgλe(ek)⩽1.Sinceλ-fuzzy measure of each expert is obtained by Eq. (27),λ=λecan be derived by solving Eq. (8). Then, theλe-fuzzy measure of any combination of expert set can be calculated by Eq. (7). The Shapley weighting vectorSh(E,gλe)corresponding to expert set is determined by Eq. (9). Moreover, the GILSCA operator is used to aggregate all the interval linguistic decision matricesZ̃1,Z̃2,…,Z̃qinto a collective interval 2-tuple linguistic decision matrixZ̃=(z̃ij)m×nas follows:(28)z̃ij=[(slij,θlij),(srij,θrij)]=GILSCAz̃ij(1),z̃ij(2),…,z̃ij(q)=Δf-1∑k=1qShk(E,gλe)(f(Δ-1(slijk,θlijk)))σ∑k=1qShk(E,gλe)(f(Δ-1(slijk,θlijk)))-σ12σ,Δf-1∑k=1qShk(E,gλe)(f(Δ-1(srijk,θrijk)))σ∑k=1qShk(E,gλe)(f(Δ-1(srijk,θrijk)))-σ12σ.For the attributeuj(j∈{1,2,…,n}), the deviation of alternativevi(i∈{1,2,…,m})to all the other alternatives is written as(29)dij′=∑k=1mShj(U,gλu)d′(z̃ij,z̃kj),wheregλuis theλ-fuzzy measure on attribute set U, and(30)d′(z̃ij,z̃kj)=|Δ-1(slij,θlij)-Δ-1(slkj,θlkj)|+|Δ-1(srij,θrij)-Δ-1(srkj,θrkj)|2(t-1).Furthermore, the deviation value of all alternatives to other alternative corresponding to attributeujis expressed as(31)dj′=∑i=1m∑k=1mShj(U,gλu)d′(z̃ij,z̃kj).To maximizing deviation values for all the attributes, when measuregλuis superadditive, the following programming model (M-j)is constructed(j=1,2,…,n):(M-j):maxdj′=∑i=1m∑k=1mShj(U,gλu)d′(z̃ij,z̃kj),s.t.gλu(∅)=0,gλu({uj})⩾0;gλu(A)=1λu∏uj∈A(1+λugλu({uj}))-1,A⊆U;∏uj∈U(1+λugλu({uj}))=λu+1;Shj(U,gλu)=∑A:uj∈A⊆U(|A|-1)!(|U|-|A|)!|U|![gλu(A)-gλu(A⧹{j})].Since all attributes are fair without any additional preference, the models (M-1), (M-2),…, (M-n)can be integrated into the following programming model:(M-int):maxd′=∑j=1n∑i=1m∑k=1mShj(U,gλu)d′(z̃ij,z̃kj),s.t.gλu(∅)=0,gλu({uj})⩾0;gλu(A)=1λu∏uj∈A(1+λugλu({uj}))-1,A⊆U;∏uj∈U(1+λugλu({uj}))=λu+1;Shj(U,gλu)=∑A:uj∈A⊆U(|A|-1)!(|U|-|A|)!|U|![gλu(A)-gλu(A⧹{j})].By solving model (M-int), the optimal solutiongλu({u1}),gλu({u2}),…,gλu({un})andλ=λuare obtained. Based on Eq. (8), theλu-fuzzy measure of any combination of attribute set are calculated by Eq. (7). Then, the Shapley weighting vectorSh(U,gλu)corresponding to attribute set is determined by Eq. (9). Furthermore, the GILSCA operator is employed to aggregate the interval 2-tuple linguistic information in decision matrixZ̃=(z̃ij)m×n, and then the collective overall preference valuesc̃i(i=1,2,…,n)of alternativeviis derived by(32)c̃i=GILSCA(z̃i1,z̃i2,…,z̃in)=Δf-1∑k=1nShk(U,gλu)(f(Δ-1(slik,θlik)))σ∑k=1nShk(U,gλu)(f(Δ-1(slik,θlik)))-σ12σ,Δf-1∑k=1nShk(U,gλu)(f(Δ-1(srik,θrik)))σ∑k=1nShk(U,gλu)(f(Δ-1(srik,θrik)))-σ12σ.By Eq. (22), the ranking ofc̃1,c̃2,…,c̃nis determined. Thus, the order of all the alternatives are achieved in accordance with the ranking ofc̃1,c̃2,…,c̃n, and the best alternative is selected synchronously.Based on the above analysis, a GILSCA operator based group decision making (GOGDM) algorithm can be briefly stated as follows (the framework of GOGDM algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1).GOGDM algorithm:Step 1.Set up interval linguistic decision matrixZ̃kbased on linguistic label set S by expertek,k=1,2,…,q.By Eqs. (25) and (26), the total deviation of interval linguistic decision matrixZ̃k(k=1,2,…,q)is calculated. Theλ-fuzzy measure of each expert is obtained by Eq. (27).Utilize Eq. (8) to deriveλe, and theλe-fuzzy measure of any combination of expert set are calculated by Eq. (7). Moreover, the Shapley weighting vector corresponding to expert set is calculated by Eq. (9).Select a preference functionf(x)according to experts’ risk attitude, then the GILSCA operator is used to aggregate matricesZ̃1,Z̃2,…,Z̃qinto a collective decision matrixZ̃=(z̃ij)m×n.Based on Eqs. (29)–(31), programming model (M-int) is established. Theλuand the optimal fuzzy measure of attributesgλu({u1}),gλu({u2}),…,gλu({un})are obtained by solving model (M-int).Theλu-fuzzy measure of any combination of attribute set are calculated by Eq. (7). Moreover, the Shapley weighting vector corresponding to attribute set is determined by Eq. (9).The collective overall preference valuec̃i(i=1,2,…,n)of alternativeviis derived by Eq. (32).By Eq. (22), the ranking ofc̃1,c̃2,…,c̃nis determined.Rank all the alternativesv1,v2,…,vnand select the best one in accordance with the ranking ofc̃1,c̃2,…,c̃n.End.In the following, a problem of facility location selection (adapted from Zhang et al. [43]) is given to illustrate the validity of the GOGDM algorithm.Assume that there is an automobile plant, which wants to choose the best facility location in China. After preliminary market survey, five possible alternatives remain for further selection:v1(Central China area),v2(West China area),v3(South China area),v4(South-central China area),v5(Southwest China area). To select the best alternative, three experts(e1,e2ande3)take the following four attributes into account:u1(environment impact),u2(favorable labor climate),u3(proximity to suppliers and resources),u4(proximity to markets).Step 1.Assume that three experts use the linguistic label setS={s1:VP,s2:P,s3:M,s4:G,s5:VG}to express his/her preference information on alternatives under the above four attibutes, respectively. Then, original interval linguistic decision matricesZ̃1,Z̃2andZ̃3are shown in Tables 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, respectively.From Definition 2.2,Z̃1,Z̃2andZ̃3can be equivalently written by 2-tuple linguistic representation, shown in Tables 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, respectively.By Eq. (26), we haved11=0,d12=0.131,d13=0.169,d21=0.131,d22=0,d23=0.175,d31=0.169,d32=0.175,d33=0.Accordingly, the total deviation of interval linguistic decision matrix is calculated asd1=∑p=13d1p=0.300,d2=∑p=13d2p=0.306,d3=∑p=13d3p=0.344.AssumeM=0.08is selected by experts, from Eq. (27), we havegλe({e1})=0.267,gλe({e2})=0.261,gλe({e3})=0.233.By solving the equation(1+0.267λe)(1+0.261λe)(1+0.233λe)=1+λe, we getλe=1.132. Using Eq. (7), theλe-fuzzy measures of any combination of expert set are obtained as:gλe({e1,e2})=0.607,gλe({e1,e3})=0.570,gλe({e2,e3})=0.563.Moreover, we havegλe({e1,e2,e3})=1. By Eq. (9), the Shapley weighting vector corresponding to the expert set is determined as:Sh1(E,gλe)=0.348,Sh2(E,gλe)=0.342,Sh3(E,gλe)=0.310.For convenience, we setσ=1here. Suppose that all the experts are neutral to risk, thenf(x)=xis selected. Using the GILSCA operator to aggregate matricesZ̃1,Z̃2andZ̃3into a collective decision matrixZ̃, which is expressed in Table 5.7.From Eq. (30), we haved′(z̃11,z̃21)=0.164,d′(z̃11,z̃31)=0.247,d′(z̃11,z̃41)=0.039,d′(z̃11,z̃51)=0.339,d′(z̃21,z̃31)=0.411,d′(z̃21,z̃41)=0.202,d′(z̃21,z̃51)=0.502,d′(z̃31,z̃41)=0.209,d′(z̃31,z̃51)=0.091,d′(z̃41,z̃51)=0.300,d′(z̃12,z̃22)=0.269,d′(z̃12,z̃32)=0.467,d′(z̃12,z̃42)=0.042,d′(z̃12,z̃52)=0.075,d′(z̃22,z̃32)=0.199,d′(z̃22,z̃42)=0.311,d′(z̃22,z̃52)=0.194,d′(z̃32,z̃42)=0.510,d′(z̃32,z̃52)=0.392,d′(z̃42,z̃52)=0.117,d′(z̃13,z̃23)=0.390,d′(z̃13,z̃33)=0.421,d′(z̃13,z̃43)=0.082,d′(z̃13,z̃53)=0.264,d′(z̃23,z̃33)=0.031,d′(z̃23,z̃43)=0.462,d′(z̃23,z̃53)=0.126,d′(z̃33,z̃43)=0.494,d′(z̃33,z̃53)=0.157,d′(z̃43,z̃53)=0.336,d′(z̃14,z̃24)=0.244,d′(z̃14,z̃34)=0.226,d′(z̃14,z̃44)=0.282,d′(z̃14,z̃54)=0.089,d′(z̃24,z̃34)=0.470,d′(z̃24,z̃44)=0.526,d′(z̃24,z̃54)=0.332,d′(z̃34,z̃44)=0.056,d′(z̃34,z̃54)=0.137,d′(z̃44,z̃54)=0.194,d′(z̃ij,z̃ij)=0fori∈{1,2,…,m}andj∈{1,2,…,n}.By solving model (M-int), we getgλu({u1})=0.152,gλu({u2})=0.128,gλu({u3})=0.174,gλu({u4})=0.093,λu=3.144.Based on Eq. (7), theλu-fuzzy measures of any combination of attribute set are calculated asgλu({u1,u2})=0.341,gλu({u1,u3})=0.409,gλu({u1,u4})=0.289,gλu({u2,u3})=0.372,gλu({u2,u4})=0.258,gλu({u3,u4})=0.318,gλu({u1,u2,u3})=0.702,gλu({u1,u2,u4})=0.534,gλu({u1,u3,u4})=0.622,gλu({u2,u3,u4})=0.574.Furthermore, we havegλu({u1,u2,u3,u4})=1. The Shapley value corresponding to attributes is determined bySh1(U,gλu)=0.274,Sh2(U,gλu)=0.239,Sh3(U,gλu)=0.305,Sh4(U,gλu)=0.182.From Eq. (32), the collective overall preference values are obtained asc̃1=[(s1,0.79),(s4,-0.47)],c̃2=[(s2,-0.47),(s3,0.26)],c̃3=[(s2,-0.26),(s3,0.49)],c̃4=[(s2,-0.33),(s3,0.29)],c̃5=[(s2,-0.25),(s4,-0.33)].By Eq. (22), the ranking isc̃5≻c̃1≻c̃3≻c̃4≻c̃2.Therefore, the best alternative isv5. Namely, the automobile plant should select the southwest China area.Assume thatã1,ã2andã3are the same interval 2-tuple linguistic values given in Example 3.1. For comparing with the GIVTWA operator in [32], we setf(x)=xandSh(N,μ)=13,13,13withσ=1,σ=-1andσ→0, respectively. Then, the aggregation results are obtained, shown in Table 6.1.From Table 6.1, the aggregation results calculated by the GILSCA operator are equal with respect toσ=1andσ=-1. This just verifies Property 3.4. For the same interval 2-tuple linguistic valuesã1,ã2andã3given in Example 3.1, we denote the left and right chi-square deviations between input interval 2-tuple linguistic values and aggregation results byJ1(σ)andJ2(σ), respectively. Based on Eqs. (14) and (15), the left and right chi-square deviations corresponding to the GILSCA operator are obtained asJ1(1)=0.0549,J1(-1)=0.0549,limσ→0J1(σ)=0,J2(1)=0.0253,J2(-1)=0.0253,limσ→0J2(σ)=0.Moreover, the left and right chi-square deviations corresponding to the GIVTWA operator are calculated asJ1(1)=0.0557,J1(-1)=0.0549,limσ→0J1(σ)=0,J2(1)=0.0254,J2(-1)=0.0253,limσ→0J2(σ)=0.Obviously, forσ=1,σ=-1andσ→0, the left and right chi-square deviation values corresponding to the GIVTWA operator are not smaller than the deviation values corresponding to the GILSCA operator, respectively. Actually, from Eqs. (14) and (15), it is clear that the GILSCA operator is the optimal aggregation for minimizing the left and right chi-square deviation values. This supports the optimality of the GILSCA operator. Calculating the input interval linguistic values by the GILSCA operator and the GIVTWA operator respectively, the aggregation results with respect to the continuous value ofσare obtained, shown in Fig. 2.In order to show the advantage and validity of the proposed approach, we compare our approach with Zhang’s approach [43] in dealing with group decision making problem under linguistic environment. In what follows, Zhang’s approach is employed to solve the above-mentioned facility location selection problem.Step 1.Assume that three experts provide his/her preference information on each alternative by using linguistic labels, and the interval linguistic decision matrices corresponding to three experts are the same asZ̃1,Z̃2andZ̃3(shown in Tables 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, respectively).Taking the average of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers corresponding to interval linguistic variables’ left and right endpoint, interval linguistic decision matricesZ̃1,Z̃2andZ̃3are converted to intuitionistic fuzzy number decision matricesB1,B2andB3(shown in Tables 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4, respectively).The group preference vectorV̂iG(i=1,2,…,5)for each alternativevican be calculated asV̂1G=((0.422,0.488),(0.338,0.572),(0.572,0.338),(0.505,0.405));V̂2G=((0.322,0.588),(0.505,0.405),(0.388,0.522),(0.655,0.255));V̂3G=((0.588,0.322),(0.638,0.272),(0.322,0.588),(0.372,0.538));V̂4G=((0.455,0.455),(0.305,0.605),(0.638,0.272),(0.322,0.588));V̂5G=((0.638,0.272),(0.388,0.522),(0.438,0.472),(0.455,0.455)).Denoting the ith row of intuitionistic fuzzy number decision matricesBk(k=1,2,3)byV̂ik, the similarity measureSikbetweenV̂ik(k=1,2,3)andV̂iGis obtained as follows:S11=0.954,S12=0.986,S13=0.936,S21=0.994,S22=0.988,S23=0.995,S31=0.992,S32=0.988,S33=0.977,S41=0.992,S42=0.996,S43=0.989,S51=0.986,S52=0.990,S53=0.996.The decision deviations of the three experts for each alternativesvi(i=1,2,…,5)are calculated as follows:d11=0.005,d12=0.027,d13=0.023,d21=0.002,d22=0.004,d23=0.003,d31=0.006,d32=0.002,d33=0.009,d41=0.000,d42=0.004,d43=0.003,d51=0.005,d52=0.001,d53=0.005.Assume the decision maker gives the threshold valueδ=0.05, then three experts reach group consensus and do not need to revised their preference information.The intuitionistic fuzzy vector corresponding to ideal alternative isA∗=((0.99,0.01),(0.99,0.01),(0.99,0.01),(0.99,0.01)).Since the interactive phenomenon among attributes are not considered here, andgλu({u1})=0.152,gλu({u2})=0.128,gλu({u3})=0.174,gλu({u4})=0.093, then the weight vectorWuof four attributes can be obtained by normalizing thegλufuzzy measure of attributes, i.e.,Wu=(0.278,0.234,0.318,0.170).The weighted similarity measure matrix M betweenV̂ikandA∗is obtained as follows:M=0.7770.7070.7360.7170.7600.7310.6260.7240.7310.7420.7490.7500.7910.7280.827.Since the interactive phenomenon among experts are not considered here, andgλe({e1})=0.267,gλe({e2})=0.261,gλe({e3})=0.233, then the weight vectorWeof three experts can be calculated by normalizing thegλefuzzy measure of experts, i.e.,We=(0.351,0.343,0.306). Thus, the collective overall preference values of the alternatives areO′=o1′,o2′,o3′,o4′,o5′=We×M=(0.752,0.692,0.749,0.725,0.774).Normalizing the vectorO′, we obtain the ranking vectorO=(0.204,0.187,0.203,0.196,0.210).Therefore, the ranking of alternatives isv5≻v1≻v3≻v4≻v2. Obviously, the best selection is alternativev5.Obviously, the decision result of the proposed approach is in agreement with the approach in [43], but there are still some difference among these results. In the proposed approach, we denotep(c̃i⩾c̃j)=pij, then(pij)5×5is a fuzzy preference relation. By Eq (22), we have(pij)5×5=0.50.5760.5130.5540.4860.4240.50.4370.4750.4140.4870.5630.50.5400.4740.4460.5250.4600.50.4350.5140.5860.5260.5650.5.Xu [44] proposed a valid formula to generate the ranking vector from a fuzzy preference relation, shown as follow:(33)oi=1n(n-1)∑j=1npij+n2-1,i=1,2,…,n,where n is the order of matrix(pij)n×n. Based on Eqs. (22) and (33), we haveO=(o1,o2,o3,o4,o5)=(0.206,0.188,0.203,0.193,0.210). Moreover, the ranking values calculated by two approaches are illustrated in Fig. 3.Denotingγ=omaxmax{r|r∈{o1,o2,o3,o4,o5}⧹{omax}},omax=max{o1,o2,o3,o4,o5}.γcan be regarded as the distinguishability of computational results. By the proposed approach and Zhang’s approach, we haveγ=1.019andγ=1.029, respectively. It is clear that the distinguishability of computational results are changed. The reasons for the change of distinguishability are pointed out as follows:(1)In Zhang’s approach, the linguistic labels are converted to intuitionistic fuzzy numbers by a simple linear transformation. However, the intuitionistic fuzzy number is a very special form of the fuzzy quantity. This may lead to the loss of decision information. In the proposed approach, 2-tuple linguistic representation is given to avoid the loss of interval linguistic information in process of aggregation.Due to the universal relation of things, the interactive phenomenon should be taken into account in group decision making problems. Nevertheless, the interactive phenomenon among experts (or attributes) is not considered in Zhang’s approach. In the proposed approach, fuzzy measure and Shapley value are provided to describe the interactive phenomenon effectively, and thus avoid information losing and biased results.In sum, the above-mentioned reasons may cause the change of distinguishability of computational results, and make some potential variation in decision making.This paper introduces a new linguistic aggregation operator which is named the generalized interval 2-tuple linguistic Shapley chi-square averaging (GILSCA) operator. Meanwhile some special cases and desirable properties of the proposed operator are studied. The main advantages of this paper are shown as follows:(1)The GILSCA operator considers the interactive phenomenon among experts (or attributes).2-tuple linguistic representation is given to avoid the loss of interval linguistic information in process of aggregation.The GILSCA operator illustrates a new type of optimal aggregation which is based on the chi-square deviation.Some effective formulae and programming models are provided to determine the fuzzy measure.Moreover, we develop a GOGDM algorithm to deal with multiple attribute group decision making problems under interval linguistic environment. In further research, we intend to develop further extensions to this approach by using other types of linguistic aggregation operators. Enlightened by the idea of Lu et al. [45], it is worthy to implement of the proposed approach into a software tool in the further study. We will consider several applications of the proposed aggregation operator in actual fields such as personal selection, economic forecast, medical diagnosis and property evaluation.
