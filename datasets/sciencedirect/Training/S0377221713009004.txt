@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The subject of this paper is the problem of finding the optimal replenishment schedule for an inventory, subject to time-dependent demand and deterioration, within a finite time planning horizon. It is shown that taking inflation into account has a profound effect on the solution of the problem. For instance, there is a critical number of replenishment periods, in excess of which the optimal schedule is characterized by the inclusion of token orders at the end of the planning horizon. This and other conclusions, obtained via a careful mathematical analysis of the problem, rectify those of earlier studies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The archetypical model of inventory control concerns a stock that diminishes due to consumer demand and deterioration (Goyal & Giri, 2001; Raafat, 1991). When the demand is time-dependent, the control problem is to minimize the total cost of holding and replenishing the stock within a finite time planning horizon. The decision variables are the number of occasions on which the stock is to be replenished and the moments at which this replenishment should occur. When shortages are allowed, the times at which the stock is exhausted and a period of shortage commences become further decision variables. Taking inflation into account leads to a modification of the cost function, without altering its structure. One might therefore expect that inflation is of little consequence with regard to the mathematics of the optimization problem. Indeed, with the notable exception of a result concerning the problem with shortages (Chern, Yang, Teng, & Papachristos, 2008, Theorem 1, part 1), previous studies support this observation. The publications (Bose, Goswami, & Chaudhuri, 1995; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chern et al., 2008; Chung, Liu, & Tsai, 1997; Datta & Pal, 1991; Hariga, 1995; Misra, 1975, 1979; Moon, Giri, & Ko, 2005; Pentico & Drake, 2011; Yang, Teng, & Chern, 2001; Yang, Teng, & Chern, 2010) are among the most significant contributing to the overwhelming evidence that incorporating inflation is of quantitative importance only. In this paper we shall show that the opposite is the case. We shall demonstrate that taking inflation into account has a drastic effect on the solution of the optimization problem.Consider the classical inventory model(1)I′=-D-θI,in which I denotes the level of stock,I′the rate of change of I with respect to timet,Dthe demand rate, andθthe rate of deterioration. Take the planning horizon to be0⩽t⩽H, where H is positive and finite, and assume that D andθsatisfy Hypothesis 1 below. Denote the number of occasions upon which the inventory is replenished during the planning horizon by n, and, the consecutive times at which this replenishment occurs byt0,t1,…,tn-1. Settingtn=Hfor completeness,(2)0=t0<t1<t2<⋯<tn-1<tn=H.Assuming that replenishment occurs instantaneously (at an infinite rate) when a positive inventory level reaches zero, Eq. (1) prescribes(3)I(t)=∫ttjeθ(u-t)D(u)dufort∈[tj-1,tj)andj=1,2,…,n. The standard cost structure associated with this inventory consists of a fixed setup cost K, a holding cost per unit stock per unit timech, and a purchasing cost per unit stockcp. Together these give rise to a total cost of(4)Sn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nK+∫tj-1tjchI(t)dt+cpI(tj-1)where I is given by (3). An equivalent cost model comprising the total cost of ordering, holding, and spillage of deteriorated items is(5)Sn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nK+∫tj-1tjchI(t)dt+cp∫tj-1tjθI(t)dt.On account of their components, we shall refer to (4) and (5) as the OHP and OHD cost functions respectively. For every natural number n, both cost functions have a common unique minimum with respect to(t0,t1,…,tn)satisfying (2). Moreover, ifsndenotes the corresponding minimum value of either cost function, thensnis a strictly convex function of n, i.e.(6)sn+1-sn>sn-sn-1for alln⩾2.(The origination of the model (1) can be credited to Ghare and Schrader (1963). It has become a cornerstone of the modelling of a deteriorating inventory (Bakker, Riezebos, & Teunter, 2012; Goyal & Giri, 2001; Raafat, 1991), and, has been embraced in many studies of one, the other, or both of the cost functions (4) and (5). The two cost functions are equivalent because quantitatively they differ by an amount that is independent of the decision variables. This can be demonstrated using elementary calculus. The first rigorous mathematical proof of the existence of a unique minimum of the cost function(s) for fixed n was provided by Donaldson (1977) in the particular case that D is linear andθ=0. The result was subsequently established for more general D andθ=0by Henery (1979). Further proofs under progressively weaker hypotheses on both D andθhave been presented by Balkhi and Benkherouf (2004), Benkherouf and Balkhi (1997), and Benkherouf and Gilding (2009). As a matter of fact, assuming that the remainder of Hypothesis 1 holds, the most recent does without part (iii) of this hypothesis. Priority for a proof of the convexity of the minimum value with respect to n can be claimed by Friedman (1982) for the case whereθ=0and a priori D is hypothesized to be such that there is a unique minimum satisfying (2) for all n. A proof covering a broader class of models is given in (Benkherouf & Gilding, 2009).)Hypothesis 1(i)D∈C1([0,H]), i.e. D is continuously differentiable in(0,H)and both D and its (first) derivative are continuously extendible to 0 and H.D is positive on[0,H].D is nondecreasing on[0,H].D′/Dis non-increasing on[0,H].θis a nonnegative constant.In reality, costs are affected by inflation. The adaptation to account for inflation in economic order quantity (EOQ) models was pioneered by Buzacott (1975), Misra (1975), and Bierman and Thomas (1977). A refinement due to Misra (1979) was to distinguish between inflation occurring at internal and external rates. The internal inflation rate can be viewed as one which is determined by the financial circumstances of the particular inventory holder, whereas the external inflation rate is determined by the ambient economic state. Extensions to finite time planning horizon models followed (Bose et al., 1995; Chandra & Bahner, 1985; Chern et al., 2008; Chung et al., 1997; Datta & Pal, 1991; Dye & Hsieh, 2011; Hariga, 1995; Hsieh & Dye, 2010; Moon et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2001, 2010). The adaptation to include the effect of inflation in the OHP cost function (4) is to takeSn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nKe-ritj-1+∫tj-1tjch,ie-rit+ch,ee-retI(t)dt+cpe-retj-1I(tj-1).In this formula,ridenotes the nett discount rate accounting for internal inflation,rethe nett discount rate accounting for external inflation, and,ch,iandch,eholding costs corresponding to the respective types of inflation. The analogous adaptation of the OHD cost function (5) readsSn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nKe-ritj-1+∫tj-1tjch,ie-rit+ch,ee-retI(t)dt+cpe-retj-1∫tj-1tjθI(t)dt.Contrary to the situation without inflation, whenre>0the OHP and OHD cost functions are not equivalent. As in (Dye & Hsieh, 2011; Hsieh & Dye, 2010), we shall assume thatri=re,dispense with their distinguishing subscript, and combinech,iandch,einto the single holding costch. Thus, the OHP and OHD cost functions taking inflation into account become(7)Sn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nKe-rtj-1+∫tj-1tjche-rtI(t)dt+cpe-rtj-1I(tj-1)and(8)Sn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nKe-rtj-1+∫tj-1tjche-rtI(t)dt+cpe-rtj-1∫tj-1tjθI(t)dtrespectively. It is these extensions of (4) and (5) that are our concern. For further possible generalizations of these models, we refer to the literature reviews (Bakker et al., 2012; Goyal & Giri, 2001; Raafat, 1991).For both cost functions (7) and (8) withK>0andr>0, we shall prove that there exists a natural number N such thatSnhas a unique minimum with respect to(t0,t1,…,tn)satisfying (2) if and only ifn⩽N. Forn⩾N+1there is a unique infimum given by(9)0=t0<t1<⋯<tN=tN+1=⋯=tn=H.In other words, to attain a minimum one has to include unrealistic periods with time span zero. Furthermore, lettingsndenote the corresponding minimum or infimum value of the cost function, (6) holds if and only ifn⩽N. For everyn⩾N+1,sn+1-sn=sN+1-sN.Thus, when inflation is taken into account, the character of the minimum of the cost functions (4) and (5) undergoes a radical change. Moreover, the property of strict convexity of the minimum value with respect to n is lost.We shall also consider the corresponding problem when a shortage of stock is allowed between consecutive periods of consumption, and one may optionally start or end with a period of shortage. We shall show that for both the OHP and OHD cost models, the optimum of this problem undergoes a like change in character. These deductions refute ones in (Chern et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2001, 2010).The technique we use is an extension of the approach to this general structured type of optimization problem in (Benkherouf & Gilding, 2009). This approach has since proven fruitful for a number of other related problems (Al-Khamis, Benkherouf, & Omar, in press; Benkherouf & Boushehri, 2012; Benkherouf & Omar, 2010). The extension is the content of the coming section. Section 3 is then devoted to the finite time planning horizon problem without shortages, and Section 4 to the one with. Both of the last-mentioned sections close with a subsection comprising a discussion of the consequences of the analysis.Both the cost functions (7) and (8) may be written in the form(10)Sn(t0,t1,…,tn)=∑j=1nRj(tj-1,tj),where{Rj}j=1n⊂C2(Ω),C2(Ω)denotes the set of real functions defined on the interior ofΩfor which every partial derivative of order two or less exists and is continuously extendible toΩ, andΩ={(x,y):0⩽x⩽y⩽H}.For the OHP cost function (7), everyRjis given by(11)R(x,y)=Ke-rx+ch∫xye-rtκ(t,y)dt+cpe-rxκ(x,y),where, by substitution of (3) in (7) and comparison of the outcome with (10) and (11),(12)κ(x,y)=∫xyeθ(t-x)D(t)dt.For the OHD cost function (8), everyRjreads(13)R(x,y)=Ke-rx+ch∫xye-rtκ(t,y)dt+cpθe-rx∫xyκ(t,y)dt.In Benkherouf and Gilding (2009), it was shown that any sum of the form (10) has a unique minimum satisfying (2), under a number of generic assumptions on{Rj}j=1n. WhenK>0andr>0, the functions (11) and (13) violate two of these assumptions. This motivates the extension of the theory in Benkherouf and Gilding (2009) below, with the consequent consolidation of the outcome. Although in (7) and (8) the functions{Rj}j=1nare identical, we allow them to be different so that the theory encompasses the problem with shortages.The first theorem below concerns the existence of a unique minimum ofSnfor fixed n; the second and third, the nature of the minimum. The remaining two theorems describe properties of the minimum when n is a variable and the functionsRjrepeat themselves with frequency p. For the cost functions (7) and (8),p=1. The corresponding models with shortages are such thatp=2.The statement of the first theorem contains some unconventional notation which merits explanation.Conventionally,Cp([a,b])forp⩾1denotes the set of functions defined in the interval(a,b)such that every derivative of order p or less exists in(a,b)and is continuously extendible to a and b. For such a function,φsay,φ(q)(t)denotes the derivative of order q att∈(a,b),φ(q)(a)the limit ofφ(q)(t)ast↓a, andφ(q)(b)the limit ofφ(q)(t)ast↑b, forq=0,1,…,p. It is an exercise in calculus to show thatφ(q)(a)is the right derivative ofφ(q-1)at a, andφ(q)(b)is the left derivative ofφ(q-1)at b forq=1,2,…,p.We introduce the notationCp,q([0,H])forp⩾1to denote the set of functionsφ∈Cp-1([0,H])such thatφ∈∩k=1mCp([uk-1,uk])for a partition0=u0<u1<⋯<um-1<um=Hwith1⩽m⩽q+1. Thus,Cp,0([0,H])=Cp([0,H]), and,Cp,q+1([0,H])⊂Cp,q([0,H])for everyq⩾0.For anyφ∈Cp,q([0,H]), we denote the right derivative ofφ(p-1)att∈[0,H)byφ(p)(t+), and the left derivative ofφ(p-1)att∈(0,H]byφ(p)(t-). If it is stated thatφ(p)(t±)has a certain property fort∈[a,b]⊆[0,H]anywhere in this paper, this means thatφ(p)(t+)has the property for allt∈[a,b)andφ(p)(t-)has the property for allt∈(a,b]. If it is known thatφ∈Cp([a,b]), the left and right notation is dispensed with.Theorem 1Suppose thatRj∈C2(Ω)and(14)∂x∂yRj<0inΩforj=1,2,…,n. Suppose furthermore that there is a functionf∈C([0,H])such that(15)LxRj⩾0andLyRj⩾0inΩforj=1,2,…,n, where(16)LxR=∂x2R+∂x∂yR+f(x)∂xRand(17)LyR=∂x∂yR+∂y2R+f(y)∂yR.Then, the functionSnhas a unique minimum with respect to(t0,t1,…,tn)satisfying(18)0=t0⩽t1⩽t2⩽⋯⩽tn-1⩽tn=hfor everyh∈[0,H]. Moreover the minimum is given bytn=hand(19)tj=τj(tj+1)forj=n-1,n-2,…,0,for a uniquely defined sequence of functions{τj}j=0n-1each of which has the propertiesτj∈C1,j([0,H]),(20)τj(t)=0fort∈[0,ηj]for someηj∈[0,H],(21)τj(t)=tfort∈[0,hj]for somehj∈[0,H], and(22)0<τj′(t±)<1fort∈(ηj,H)∩(hj,H)‾.Suppose, further to the hypotheses ofTheorem 1, that(23)∂yRj+∂xRj+1(0,0)⩽0for somej=1,2,…,n-1. Thenηj=0.Suppose, further to the hypotheses ofTheorem 1, that(24)∂yRj+∂xRj+1(hj-1,hj-1)⩽0for somej=1,2…,n-1. Thenhj⩾hj-1with strict inequality if and only ifhj-1<Hand(24)is strict.Suppose that{Rj}j=1∞satisfies the hypotheses ofTheorem 1for alln⩾1, and that there exists ap∈Nsuch that(25)Rj+p=Rjforallj⩾1.Suppose furthermore that∂yRj+∂xRj+1(x,x)⩽0for allx∈[0,H]andj=1,2,…,p, and,(26)∑j=1p∂xRj+∂yRj(x,x)<0forallx∈[0,H].Then there exists anN∈Nsuch thathn=Hforn⩾N.Suppose that the introductory hypotheses ofTheorem 4hold. Denote the minimum value ofSnunder the constraint(18)bysn(h). Then(27)sn+p+1(h)-sn+1(h)⩾sn+p(h)-sn(h)for allh∈[0,H]andn⩾1. Furthermore, supposing that(23)holds forj=p, the inequality(27)is strict if and only ifhn<h⩽H.The proof of each of the above theorems is to be found in Appendices A–E respectively.Throughout the remainder of this paper, we assume the following without further mention.Hypothesis 2K,ch,cpand r are nonnegative constants, andch+cpθis positive.To follow the approach outlined in the previous section, the crucial task is to establish that the functions (11) and (13) meet the assumptions. We make this the content of the next lemma, whose proof is given in Appendix F.Lemma 1The functions(11)and(13)are of classC2(Ω)and satisfy(14)and(15)forf(t)=r-D′(t)/D(t). Furthermore,(28)∂yR+∂xR(x,x)=-Kre-rxfor0⩽x⩽H.Given the above lemma, the general theory in the previous section leads to the following.Theorem 6Both of the cost functions(7)and(8)have a unique minimum satisfying the constraint(29)0=t0⩽t1⩽t2⩽⋯⩽tn-1⩽tn=Hfor everyn∈N. Moreover:(a)IfKr=0then the minimum fulfils(2).IfKr>0then there exists anN∈Nsuch that the minimum fulfils(2)forn⩽Nand(9)forn⩾N+1.In the light of Lemma 1, Theorem 1 gives the existence of a unique minimum(t0,t1,…,tn)of both cost functions under the constraint (29) irrespective of the magnitude of n. Furthermore, it says that the minimum is prescribed bytn=Hand (19) for a unique sequence of functions{τj}j=0∞⊂C([0,H])each of which has the properties (20)–(22) for someηj∈[0,H]andhj∈[0,H]. The sequence starts withτ0≡0, for whichh0=0. Theorem 2 implies thatηj=0for allj⩾1. Simultaneously, Theorem 3 implies thathj+1⩾hjfor allj⩾0with strict inequality if and only ifhj<HandKr>0. It follows that ifKr=0, then the minimum satisfies (2) for alln∈N. On the other hand, ifKr>0, it satisfies (2) as long ashn<H. Otherwise, it satisfies (9). By Theorem 4 there is anN∈Nsuch thathN=H. We take N to be the smallest such number. □Further toTheorem 6, letsndenote the minimum value of the respective cost function under the constraint(29).(a)IfKr=0then(6)holds for alln⩾2.IfKr>0then(6)holds forn=2,3,…,N, and(30)sn=sN+(n-N)Ke-rHforn⩾N.Returning to the proof of the previous theorem, whenKr>0we havehn<Hforn=1,2,…,N-1andhn=Hforn⩾N. WhenKr=0we havehn=0for alln∈N. Coupling these observations to Theorem 5 provides the conclusions concerning (6). The identity (30) is a corollary of (9). □
