Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within gene promoter region or enhancers can modify the transcription rate of genes related to complex diseases. These SNPs can be called regulatory SNPs (rSNPs). Data compiled from recent projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project and ENCODE, has revealed essential information used to perform in silico prediction of the molecular and biological repercussions of SNPs within TFBS. However, most of these studies are very limited, as they only analyze SNPs in coding regions or when applied to promoters, and do not integrate essential biological data like TFBSs, expression profiles, pathway analysis, homotypic redundancy (number of TFBSs for the same TF in a region), chromatin accessibility and others, which could lead to a more accurate prediction. Our aim was to integrate different data in a biologically coherent method to analyze the proximal promoter regions of two antimicrobial peptide genes, DEFB1 and CAMP, that are associated with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS. We predicted SNPs within the promoter regions that are more likely to interact with transcription factors (TFs). We also assessed the impact of homotypic redundancy using a novel approach called the homotypic redundancy weight factor (HWF). Our results identified 10 SNPs, which putatively modify the binding affinity of 24 TFs previously identified as related to TB and HIV/AIDS expression profiles (e.g. KLF5, CEBPA and NFKB1 for TB; FOXP2, BRCA1, CEBPB, CREB1, EBF1 and ZNF354C for HIV/AIDS; and RUNX2, HIF1A, JUN/AP-1, NR4A2, EGR1 for both diseases). Validating with the OregAnno database and cell-specific functional/non functional SNPs from additional 13 genes, our algorithm performed 53% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity to detect functional rSNPs using the DNAseI-HUP database. We are proposing our algorithm as a novel in silico method to detect true functional rSNPs in antimicrobial peptide genes. With further improvement, this novel method could be applied to other promoters in order to design probes and to discover new drug targets for complex diseases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tuberculosis (TB) is mainly a pulmonary infection caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and around one third of the global population carry the bacilli in a latent state. In 2012, 8.6 million people developed the disease and 1.3 million died from TB (including 320,000 deaths with HIV co-infection) (World Health Organization, 2013). The TB activation route is not yet well understood (O’Garra, 2013) because there are several factors that could alter a person’s susceptibility to MTC infection. These factors could be genetic, or the host could have a co-infection of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on its progressed stage, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV infects CD4+cells like T cells and macrophages diminishing or nullifying the host’s immune activity. Genetic susceptibility to a disease can be originated by variations (e.g. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) that alter normal gene expression involved in the pathogenesis of the disease or the host’s defense (e.g. host’s immune response genes).Human β-defensin 1 (hBD-1) and cathelicidin LL-37 (peptidic products of DEFB1 and CAMP genes respectively) are antimicrobial peptides (APs), which are essential components of the innate immune response. The induction of LL-37 has been reported as a response to the defense against MTC (Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2006, 2007; Méndez-Samperio et al., 2008) by enhancing the autophagy (Yuk et al., 2009, Campbell et al., 2012) and the phagolysosome maturation (Fabri et al., 2011; Hmama et al., 2004; Realegeno and Modlin 2011; Sonawane et al., 2011) in monocytes/macrophages. LL-37 also takes on role in the defense against HIV by the induction of autophagy (Campbell et al., 2012) and inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase (Wong et al., 2011). Despite the discovery of several regulators of the CAMP gene (Gombart et al., 2005; Kida et al., 2006; Termén et al., 2008), none of them have been directly found disrupted by a SNP in its binding site or associated to a disease progression. The hBD-1 shows in vitro activity against TB (Fattorini et al., 2004), induction in M. bovis infection (Zhu et al., 2003) and suppressive activity against HIV and increases RANTES chemokine release (Sun et al., 2005), and yet it is still not clear which TFs activate the gene. SNPs in the DEFB1 promoter region have been shown to be associated to several diseases (Prado Montes de Oca et al., 2010), including TB (López Campos et al., 2014) and HIV (Estrada Aguirre et al., 2014; Freguja et al., 2012). It has been hypothesized that elicitors of this gene could potentially be used in preventing HIV/AIDS and TB, among other diseases (Prado Montes de Oca, 2013).Many efforts have been made, usually in the context of genetic association studies, to associate SNPs to TB (López Campos et al., 2014; Png et al., 2012; Thye et al., 2010, 2012Png et al., 2012; Thye et al., 2010, 2012) and HIV infection or AIDS (Fellay et al., 2009; Le Clerc et al., 2009; Parkes et al., 2013; Santa Marta et al., 2013). However, few of these studies propose a biological mechanism involved in the susceptibility because many of them are limited to performing GWAS, which are based, depending on the platform, on tag SNPs from the HapMap or on an average base pair distance from SNP to SNP to “cover” the genome. The candidate gene approach starts from a plausible biological/molecular assumption, which is the approach taken in this paper.Most SNPs in the human genome are located in non-transcribed regions, and some of these are within regulatory elements, either promoters or enhancers, affecting the binding ability of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA. These polymorphisms in regulatory elements (also called rSNPs), through a change in the gene expression level, could cause phenotype alterations and diseases or susceptibility to diseases such as hemophilia and familiar hypercholesterolemia among many others (Bryzgalov et al., 2013; Haraksingh and Snyder 2013; Kasowski et al., 2010). For this reason, the genetic factors involved in complex diseases have recently pointed in the direction of rSNPs analysis, besides those involved in changing the amino acids in the gene product. Recent projects such as the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) (Abecasis et al., 2012) attempt to systematically map genome-wide variants, while the ENCODE Project database’s (Bernstein et al., 2012) main aim is to find DNA functional elements in the human genome. These have spurred a scientific trend for creating algorithms that select rSNPs and quantify their functional impact (Lower et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Bryzgalov et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Macintyre et al., 2010; Manke et al., 2010; Schaub et al., 2012, Teng et al., 2012; Ward and Kellis 2012; Holm et al., 2010). There are several rSNP databases (Guo et al., 2014; Ning et al., 2014; Boyle et al., 2012) which could have an application in diagnostics and personalized medicine. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to predict phenotype from in silico analysis due to the high number of genetic and environmental factors involved in a disease (Cline and Karchin 2011; Fernald et al., 2011). More recent reviews on rSNPs can be found in (Li et al., 2015; Mathelier et al., 2015).There are many pitfalls and limitations from the existing algorithms and databases for achieving an accurate prediction of the transcription regulation: (1) the disease-associated SNPs in GWAS datasets (Bryzgalov et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Schaub et al., 2012; Teng et al., 2012; Ward and Kellis 2012) may not be in fact causal, since its selection is due to the linkage to other causal SNPs (Levo and Segal, 2014); (2) chromatin accessibility datasets lack many specific cell lines (Bryzgalov et al., 2013; Macintyre et al., 2010; Manke et al., 2010; Teng et al., 2012) or are limited in their use (Boyle et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Schaub et al., 2012; Ward and Kellis, 2012); (3) there are few resources integrating genetic variant databases and expression profile information (Yang et al., 2010; Holm et al., 2010), though there is a recent effort in providing tissue-specific gene expression and genotype information (GTEx Consortium, 2015); and (4) the absence of the quantification of the impact of multiple TFBSs of the same TF in the regulatory region (also called homotypic redundancy) (Boyle et al., 2012; Bryzgalov et al., 2013; Macintyre et al., 2010; Schaub et al., 2012; Teng et al., 2012; Ward and Kellis, 2012), which is an important feature in the regulation of gene expression (Gotea et al., 2010; Spivakov et al., 2012). This is because it has been suggested that the more TFBSs for a single TF in the same region, the less impact a single TFBS perturbation will have (Sharon et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013). This is based on recent work that describes a close relationship between the quantity of homotypic TFBSs and gene expression (Sharon et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013).In the present work we introduce an in silico method to assess the impact of SNPs in promoter TFBSs in DEFB1 and CAMP, two genes that are relevant to TB and HIV/AIDS. To select SNPs whose variants may affect TFs binding, we coherently integrated information from the UCSC Genome Browser (Meyer et al., 2013), ENSEMBL (Flicek et al., 2013), 1kGP database (Abecasis et al., 2012), chromatin accessibility (cell line-specific) databases from the ENCODE (Bernstein et al., 2012), Position Frequency Matrices (PFMs) from JASPAR CORE database (JCD) (Mathelier et al., 2014), and expression data from the Gene Expression Atlas (GXA) (Kapushesky et al., 2012), using a 6-step filtering method. The resultant TF-SNP interactions were prioritized using the homotypic redundancy weight factor (HWF), a term coined by our group that involves the quantification of homotypic redundancy factor (more detail in the methods section). The TB and HIV/AIDS infection pathways were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2012) and the REACTOME project (Vastrik et al., 2007). The filtering process was partially implemented in MATLAB® (R2010b).The novelty of our method involves performing a hypothesis-generating analysis of the impact and mechanism of a rSNP in promoters in a specific disease using relevant tissue/cell line accessibility database (ENCODE) (nucleosome-depleted regions and DNase accessible regions) and the resultant TFs-rSNP interactions are ranked by the value of HWF.
