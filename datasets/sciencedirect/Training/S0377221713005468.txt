@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In distribution problems, and specifically in bankruptcy issues, the Proportional (P) and the Egalitarian (EA) divisions are two of the most popular ways to resolve the conflict. Nonetheless, when using the egalitarian division, agents may receive more than her claim. We propose a compromise between the proportional and the egalitarian approaches by considering the restriction that no one receives more than her claim. We show that the most egalitarian compromise fulfilling this restriction ensures a minimum amount to each agent. We also show that this compromise can be interpreted as a process that works in two steps as follows: first, all agents receive an equal share up to the smallest claim if possible (egalitarian distribution), and then, the remaining estate (if any) is allocated proportionally to the remaining claims (proportional distribution). Finally, we obtain that the recursive application of this process finishes at the Constrained Equal Awards solution (CEA).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A claims problem is a particular case of distribution problem, in which the amount to be distributed, the estate E, is not enough to cover the agents’ claims on it. This model describes the situation faced by a court that has to distribute the net worth of a bankrupt firm among its creditors. But, it also corresponds with cost-sharing, taxation, or rationing problems. How should the scarce resources be allocated among its claimants? The formal analysis of situations like these, which originates in a seminal paper by O’Neill (1982), shows that a vast number of well-behaved solutions1The reader is referred to Moulin (2002) and Thomson (2003) as surveys of this literature.1have been defined for solving claims problems, being the Proportional and the Equal Awards (egalitarian) the two prominent concepts used in real world. The term well-behaved reflects the idea that the considered solutions might fulfill some principles of fairness, or appealing properties. A way of comparing solutions is given by the equity condition of Lorenz-dominance (see Dutta & Ray, 1989). A recent paper (Bosmans & Lauwers, 2011) compares the most usual bankruptcy rules in terms of Lorenz-dominance and analyzes those solutions that favor to smaller claimants relative to larger ones.An illustrative example of claims problems is the fishing quotas reduction, in which the agent’s claim can be understood as the previous captures, and the estate is the new (lower) level of joint captures. A similar example is given by milk quotas among the EU members.2Quotas were introduced in 1984. Each member state was given a reference quantity which was then allocated to individual producers. The initial quotas were not sufficiently restrictive as to remedy the surplus situation and so the quotas were cut in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Quotas will end on April 1, 2015.2In both examples, proportionality is the main principle used. Nevertheless, a minimal (survival) amount, guaranteed to each producer, should be fixed in order to ensure the profitability of fishing (milk) industries. That is, some part of the estate should be allocated in an egalitarian way. This idea is somewhat related to the axiom of Sustainability (see Herrero & Villar, 2002). As they mention,“Sustainability is a protective criterion for those agents with small claims. To illustrate this, consider the interpretation of a bankruptcy situation as a reduction in the fishing quotas. Here agent i’s claim corresponds to her actual level of captures and the estate to be distributed to the new aggregate level of captures. Sustainable claims correspond to those levels of captures such that, if nobody else had a larger level, the aggregate new level of captures would not impose any rationing. Sustainability says that agents with sustainable claims should not be rationed after the change in the aggregate level of captures.”A similar situation can be found when a university distributes the budget to Departments. In this case, the resources are distributed proportionally to the number of Professors, students, subjects, etc., but a minimal (fixed) amount is allocated to each regardless of size.An alternative example of using the proportional approach is the way in which seats in the Spanish Parliament are allocated to each electoral district (province).3This example involves indivisibilities, which is not a trivial issue (see, for instance, Moulin (2000)).3This is made proportionally to the population in each province, but a minimal number of seats (2) is guaranteed to each.4In the case of Spanish Parliament, the allocation mechanism is as follows (Spanish LOREG, 2011, art. 162): (1) Congress is composed of three hundred and fifty Deputies. (2) Each province has a corresponding initial minimum of two deputies. (3) The remaining two hundred and forty-eight deputies are distributed among the provinces in proportion to its population, according to the following procedure: (a) Obtain a distribution fee obtained by dividing by two hundred forty-eight the total number of the legal population of peninsular and island provinces. (b) Allocate to each province as many deputies as resulting, in whole numbers, dividing the population of provincial law by the quota allocation. (c) The remaining deputies are distributed by assigning one to each of the provinces whose quotient obtained under paragraph before, have a higher decimal fraction.4A similar situation is found in the US case: based on data from the decennial census, each state is allocated a proportion of the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, although each state is guaranteed a minimum of one seat, regardless of population.5“Each State shall have at Least one Representative” (U.S. Const., art. I, 2, cl. 3.).5The remaining seats are allocated one at a time, to the state with the highest priority number. This apportionment is based on the proportion of each state’s population to that of the Fifty States together. We shall return to these examples later.Although proportionality is the most used criterion,6“In western society, for example, the customary solution would be to split the asset in proportion to the claims”, see Young (1994, p. 123).6whenever the smallest claim is very small compared with the largest one, a proportional division provides nearly nothing for this (these) small claimant(s). In this sense, the previous comments and examples show that real world, when applying proportional distributions, try to ensure an egalitarian (minimal) amount to each agent.In this paper we will define a new solution concept that captures this behavior. This solution can be understood as a compromise between the proportional and the egalitarian distributions. In choosing this compromise, if we wanted to use the same weight on the proportional and the egalitarian distributions for each problem, the largest weight one could assign to the egalitarian distribution would be zero (otherwise for some problems an agent would receive an amount larger than her claim). So, we propose that the weight of each of the two distributions depends on the particular claims problem we are analyzing. In so doing, we define the weight used on the egalitarian distribution to be the highest weight such that the resulting vector satisfies the claims boundedness restriction.Under an alternative view, we can differentiate between two different class of problems: the first class consists of problems where the per-capita estate is small relative to the smallest claim, c1⩾E (a condition called in the literature as an unsustainable claim), whereas in the problems of the second class the smallest claim is sustainable. Then, if the claims problem is in the first category, the egalitarian distribution satisfies claims boundedness and all agents receive equal awards; if the claims problem falls in the second category, we first assign to each agent the smallest claim (egalitarian distribution), revise claims and estate accordingly, and then distribute the remaining estate proportionally to the revised claims (proportional solution). By this way, we define a new solution. Our main result, Proposition 3, shows that both approaches coincide in the same solution which we call αmin−Egalitarian solution.7An interesting question that has been addressed to us is if we can do the same for any claims rule ψ instead of the Proportional one. We will see that it is not possible, in general, to extend our results.7In short, our compromise solution:•modifies the Equal Awards division, so that the proposal satisfies the claim-boundedness condition;modifies the Proportional division and considers a minimal amount that each agent should receive, which is endogenously determined in each particular problem (E,c);8We will see that our proposal satisfies a lower bound on awards property.8provides a result that coincides with the one we would obtain if we assign to each agent this minimal amount, and distribute the remaining estate (if any) in a proportional way.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the preliminaries. Section 3 presents our solution concept. Sections 4 and 5 provide the axiomatic analysis, and in Section 6 we present some final comments. The appendix gathers the proofs.Throughout the paper we will consider a set of agents N={1,2,…,n}. Each agent is identified by her claim, ci, i∈N, on the estateE. A claims problem appears whenever the estate is not enough to satisfy all the claims; that is,∑i=1nci>E. Without loss of generality, we will order the agents according to their claims: c1⩽c2⩽⋯⩽cn. The pair (E,c) represents the claims problem, and we will denote byBthe set of all claims problems. A claims rule (solution) is a single valued functionφ:B→R+nsuch that, for each i∈N, 0⩽φi(E,c)⩽ci, (non-negativity and claim-boundedness), and∑i=1nφi(E,c)=E(efficiency).Many solution concepts have been defined in the literature aboutclaims problems (see for instance Thomson (2003) and Bosmans & Lauwers (2011)). The two most important criteria are the Proportional and the Egalitarian ones.Definition 1TheProportionalsolution, P. For each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, Pi(E,c)=λci, whereλ=E∑i∈Nci.TheEqual Awardsdivision, EA. For each(E,c)∈Band eachi∈N,EAi(E,c)=En.It is easy to find examples in which the equal distribution of the estate exceeds some agent’s claim.9For instance, consider the claims vector c=(20,50,60) and the estate E=100.9In order to solve this situation the following modification of the EA division has been introduced.Definition 3TheConstrained Equal Awardssolution, CEA. For each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, CEAi(E,c)≡min{ci,μ}, where μ is chosen so that∑i∈Nmin{ci,μ}=E.Given the Proportional and the Egalitarian divisions, we consider now the family of compromises:φα=αP+(1-α)EAα∈[0,1].That is, given a claims problem (E,c) involving n agents,φαi(E,c)=αciE∑i=1nci+(1-α)Enα∈[0,1].The following example computes this proposal for several values of α.Example 1Consider (E,c)=(100,(40,50,70)).Claimsα=0α=0.25α=0.50α=0.75α=140100/331.2529.1727.082550100/332.8132.2931.7731.2570100/335.9438.5441.1543.75As we have already mentioned, when α=0 the equal division may not satisfy the conditions of a solution (claim boundedness fails). In order to avoid this problem, we can obtain for each problem (E,c) the minimum value of α∈[0,1] such that φαis a solution:α∗(E,c)=min{α∈[0,1]suchthatforeachi∈N(φα(E,c))i⩽ci}.Remark 1Note that if we solve, for each agent i∈N, the equationαi:(φα(E,c))i=ci,thenα∗(E,c)=max{α1,α2,…,αn}The αmin−Egalitarian solution is defined for each claims problem (E,c) with ci>0 and for each i∈N, as:φmin(E,c)=φα∗(E,c)where α∗=α∗(E,c).Note that α∗ varies from a claims problem to another. However, by the way it is defined, the αmin− Egalitarian solution is continuous. Next, we consider a consistent extension of our solution in the presence of null claims, and we analyze the way of obtaining α∗(E,c).Definition 5If there are some zero claims, c1=c2=⋯=ck=0, cj>0, for each j>k, we extend our solution in a consistent way:φmin(E,c)=(0,φmin(E,c¯))0=(0,…,0)1×kc¯=(ck+1,…,cn).If the claim boundedness is fulfilled by the agent with lowest claim, it is fulfilled by each agent i∈N:(φα(E,c))1⩽c1⇒(φα(E,c))i⩽ci.See the proof in the Appendix A1.Remark 2The result in the above proposition does not remain true if we use, in order to define φα, a solution ψ different from the Proportional oneφα=αψ+(1-α)EAα∈[0,1].For instance, if we consider the problem (E,c)=(90,(10,12,100)) and a solution ψ such that ψ(90,(10,12,100))=(8,11,71), then the second agent is the one who definesα∗(E,c)=1819. See Section 6.In the following result we obtain the exact expression of α∗.Proposition 2Given a claims problem (E,c) the scalar α∗is:α∗(E,c)=max0,C(E-nc1)E(C-nc1)C=∑i=1nciFrom the expression obtained in Proposition 2, it is immediate to see that, for E⩽nc1α∗(E,c)=0 and, for E⩾nc1α∗(E,c) is an strictly increasing and concave function of E for fixed claims vector c, as shown in Fig. 1.Now, trying to facilitate the comparison with the main solutions in the literature, we compute our proposal for the next two examples taken from Bosmans and Lauwers (2011).10Hereinafter, Pin, T, CE, AP, RA, MO, and CEL will denote the Piniles’, Talmud, Constrained Egalitarian, Adjusted Proportional, Random Arrival, Minimal Overlap and Constrained Equal Losses solutions, respectively. See Thomson (2003) for their formal definitions.10Example 2(E,c)=(1500,(500,2000,3500)).ciCEA, φminPin, T, CEAPRA, MOPCEL500500250214166.712502000500625643666.750003500500625643666.78751500with α∗(E,c)=0.(E,c)=(4500,(500,2000,3500)).ciCEA, CEPinφminPRAAPTMOCEL500500500500375333.3285.72250166.70200020001625150015001333.31357.1413751416.71500350020002375250026252333.32857.1428752916.73000withα∗(E,c)=89.Finally, in the following result, we find a precise expression of our solution which gives us an interesting interpretation: this solution assigns the minimal claim to any agent; thus it distributes the remaining estate E′=E−nc1 in a proportional way among the agents with respect to the remaining claimsci′=ci-c1. The proof is given in Appendix A3.Proposition 3For each(E,c)∈B, with ci>0 for each i∈N,φmin(E,c)=(E/n)1c1⩾E/nc1+P(E-nc1,c-c1)otherwisewherec1=c1…c1n×1and1=1…1n×1The condition that splits both cases in Proposition 3 is known in the literature with the name of sustainable claim.11A claim ciis said to be sustainable in (E,c) (see Herrero & Villar (2002)) if∑j=1nmin{ci,cj}⩽E.11Note that if the smaller claim c1 is not sustainable, c1>E/n, then no claim is sustainable. Therefore, the result in Proposition 3 can be stated as:•If c1 is sustainable, then φmin(E,c)=c1+P(E−nc1,c−c1).If c1 is not sustainable, then φmin(E,c)=EA(E,c).In Fig. 2we represent the distribution of the estate, by depending on E, given by the αmin−Egalitarian solution.Remark 4It is important to mention that, as in Remark 2, the result in Proposition 3 is not true if we use a solution ψ different from the Proportional one. See Section 6.In this section we analyze our solution from an axiomatic point of view. First, next table summarizes the axiomatic comparative between the αmin− Egalitarian solution and the ones more directly related to it, CEA and P.φminPCEAOrder preservationYesYesYesResource monotonicityYesYesYesSuper-modularityYesYesYesOrder preservation under claims variationsYesYesYesComposition upYesYesYesComposition downYesYesYesInvariance under claims truncationNoNoYesSelf-dualityNoYesNoMidpoint propertyNoYesNoLimited consistencyYesYesYesReasonable lower bounds on awardsYesNoYesIn order to check that the αmin-Egalitarian solution satisfies, or not, these properties, we formally give their definitions.Order preservation (Aumann & Maschler, 1985) requires respecting the ordering of the claims: if agent i′s claim is at least as large as agent j′s claim, she should receive and lose at least as much as agent j does, respectively.Order preservation: for each(E,c)∈B, and each i, j∈N, such that ci⩾cj, then φi(E,c)⩾φj(E,c), and ci−φi(E,c)⩾cj−φj(E,c).Resource monotonicity (Curiel, Maschler, & Tijs, 1987; Young, 1987) demands that if the endowment increases, then all individuals should get at least what they received initially.Resource monotonicity: for each(E,c)∈Band eachE′∈R+such that C>E′>E, then φi(E′,c)⩾φi(E,c), for each i∈N.Super-modularity (Dagan, Serrano, & Volij, 1997) requires that if the amount to divide increases, given two individuals, the one with the greater claim experiences a larger gain than the other.Super-modularity: for each(E,c)∈B, allE′∈R+and each i, j∈N such that C>E′>E and ci⩾cj, then φi(E′,c)−φi(E,c)⩾φj(E′,c)−φj(E,c).Reasonable lower bounds on awards (Moreno-Ternero & Villar, 2004; Dominguez & Thomson, 2006) ensures that each individual receives at least the minimum of (i) her claim divided by the number of individuals and (ii) the amount available divided by the number of individuals.Reasonable lower bounds on awards: for each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N,φi(E,c)⩾min{ci,E}n.Order preservation under claims variations (Thomson, 2006) requires that if the claim of some individual decreases, given two other individuals, the one with the greater claim experiences a larger gain than the other.Order preservation under claims variations: for each k∈N, each pair (E,c) and(E,c′)∈B, withc′=(ck′,c-k)andck′<ckand each pair i and j∈N⧹k with ci⩽cj, φi(E,c′)−φi(E,c)⩽φj(E,c′)−φj(E,c).12We write(ck′,c-k)for the claims vector obtained from c by replacing ckbyck′.12Composition down requires that if, after the resources are distributed, they are reduced, a solution recommends the same allocation if we (i) cancel the initial distribution and apply the solution in the new situation or (ii) consider the initial awards as agents’ claims on the revised problem and apply the solution to this new problem.Composition down: for each (E,c)∈B, each i∈N, and each 0⩽E′⩽E, φi(E′,c)=φi(E′,φ(E,c)).Composition up shows the opposite situation to composition down. If, after the resources are distributed, they are increased, a solution recommends the same allocation if we (i) cancel the initial distribution and apply the solution in the new situation or (ii) let agents keep their initial awards, adjust claims down by these amounts, and reapply the solution to divide only the increment of the estate with these adjusted claims.Composition up: for each (E′,c)∈B, each i∈N, and each 0⩽E⩽E′, φi(E′,c)=φi(E,c)+φi(E′−E,c−φ(E,c)).Limited consistency states that adding an agent with a zero claim does not change the awards of the individuals already present. Obviously, if (E,(c1,c2,…,cn)) is a claims problem involving n individuals, then(E,(0,c1,c2,…,cn)) is a problem with n+1 individuals.Limited consistency: for each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, φi(E,c)=φi(E,(0,c1,…,cn)).Next Proposition, whose proof is given in Appendix A4, shows that the αmin-Egalitarian solution fulfills the above mentioned properties.Proposition 4The αmin-Egalitarian solution fulfills Order preservation, Resource monotonicity, Super-modularity, Reasonable lower bounds on awards, Order preservation under claims variations, Composition up, Composition down and Limited consistency.Note that there is a property our solution fulfills that is not satisfied by the Proportional solution: Reasonable lower bounds on awards. This is the part that the EA division brings to our solution. The drawback is that some properties P fulfills are lost. Next we show some of them.13It must be noticed that the main reason for not satisfying these properties is that EA, taken as a function, does not satisfy them.13Self-Duality implies that a solution recommends the same allocation when dividing awards and losses. Given a claims problem (E,c), losses are defined by the difference among the estate and the claims,L=∑i∈Nci-E.Self-duality: for each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, φi(E,c)=ci−φi(L,c).Midpoint Property ensures to each agent half of her claim when the estate equals half of the aggregate claim.Midpoint Property: for each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, if E=C/2, then φi(E,c)=ci/2.Invariance under claims truncation tells us that the part of a claim that is above the resources should not be taken into account.Invariance under claims truncation: for each(E,c)∈Band each i∈N, φi(E,c)=φi(E,min{ci,E}i∈N).The following example shows that the αmin-Egalitarian solution does not satisfy these properties.Example 4Consider (E,c)=(2000,(500,2000,3500)). Thenφmin(E,c)=(500,666.66,833.33).(L,c)=(4000,(500,2000,3500)), and φmin(L,c)=(500,1333.33,2166.66). So, c−φmin(L,c)=(0,727.28,1272.73)≠φmin(E,c), not satisfying Self-duality.Midpoint property implies φ(E,c)=(250,1000,1750)≠φmin(E,c).For (E,c′)=(2000,(500,2000,2000)), αmin(E,c′)=(500,750,750)≠φmin(E,c), not satisfying Invariance under claims truncation.Finally, we introduce an operation for solutions that will help us to analyze the iterative application of the αmin-Egalitarian solution. We name this operation Self-composition, since it is related to the Self-consistency property (see for instance Grahn & Voorneveld, 2002).14Self-consistency: for each(E,c)∈B, each S⊆N and each i∈S, thenφi(E,c)=φi∑k∈Sφk(E,c),c|S.14In particular, Self-composition proposes a “recursive” distribution of the resources starting from agent 1. Formally,Definition 6Self-composition: for each(E,c)∈B, and each m, 1⩽m⩽n, the Self-composition of degree m is defined by:φm(E,c)=(φ1(E1,c1),…,φm-1(Em-1,cm-1),φm(Em,cm),…,φn(Em,cm)),where (E1,c1)=(E,c) and for each k>1,Ek=Ek-1-φk-1(Ek-1,ck-1);ck=(0,…,0,ck,…,cn).For instance, the Self-composition of degree 2 for some solution, φ2, is obtained in the following way: first, agent 1 receives the amount recommended for her by φ(E,c); then we solve the new problem in which the estate is reduced in the amount given to agent 1, and this agent has no claim anymore. That is,φ2(E,c)=(φ1(E,c),φ2(E2,c2),φ3(E2,c2),…,φn(E2,c2))where E2=E−φ1(E,c); c2=(0,c2,…,cn).It is immediate to observe that if a solution is Self-consistent, then the Self-composition of any degree coincides with the own function (in some sense, it is idempotent); i.e., if φ satisfies Self-consistency, then for each(E,c)∈Band each m,φm(E,c)=φ(E,c).Next result, which can be straightforwardly obtained from Proposition 3, shows that if we compute the Self-composition of degree n−1 of the αmin-Egalitarian solution, we obtain the CEA solution.Proposition 5The Self-composition of degree n−1 of the αmin-Egalitarian solution retrieves the CEA solution, where n is the number of agents.The result in the above Proposition may be understood as a recursive process (for a solution φ) which can be described as follows. Assume the agents are ordered so that c1⩽c2⩽…⩽cn. The solution φ applied to the original problem (E,c) only determines the share of agent 1, who in turn leaves with this share. The estate is reduced accordingly and the updated problem, say (E2,c2) for agents 2, 3, …, n is now used only to determine the share of agent 2. Agent 2 then leaves with this share and the estate is again reduced to construct (E3,c3) for agents 3, 4,…, n. This recursive process is used to determine the share of every agent. The result shows that this recursive process, when applied to φmin, produces the CEA allocation.The αmin-Egalitarian solution does not satisfy self-consistency (otherwise, self-composition could not retrieve the CEA solution). But it satisfies a weaker version that we call backwards consistency. This condition requires that if the agent with largest claim leaves with his part, none of the other agents takes advantage.Definition 7Backwards Consistency: for each(E,c)∈B,φ(E,c)=(φ(E-φn(E,c),(c1,c2,…,cn-1,0)),φn(E,c))It is obvious that Self-consistency implies Backwards-consistency, but the converse is not true as shows the following result in which we prove that the αmin-Egalitarian solution satisfies this property. The proof is given in Appendix A5.Proposition 6The αmin-Egalitarian solution satisfies Backwards-consis- tency.An interesting tool to compare the behavior of solution concepts is that of Lorenz dominance. LetR+nbe the set of positive n-dimensional vectors x=(x1,x2,…,xn) ordered from small to large, i.e., 0<x1⩽x2⩽…⩽xn. Let x and y be inR+n. We say that x Lorenz dominates y, x≻Ly, if for each k=1, 2,…, n−1: x1+x2+⋯+xk⩾y1+y2+⋯+ykand x1+x2+⋯+xn=y1+y2+⋯+yn. If x Lorenz dominates y and x≠y, then at least one of these n−1 inequalities is a strict inequality. The following definition extends the notion of Lorenz dominance to bankruptcy solutions.Definition 8Given two solutions φ and ψ it is said that φ Lorenz dominates ψ, φ≻Lψ, if for any claims problem (E,c) the vector φ(E,c) Lorenz dominates ψ(E,c).Lorenz domination is a criterion used to check whether a solution is more favorable to smaller claimants relative to larger claimants. So, in some sense, a Lorenz dominant solution can be understood as more equitable. In a recent paper, Bosmans and Lauwers (2011) obtain a Lorenz dominance comparison among several solutions and they obtain that CEA is the more equitable solution, in the sense that it Lorenz dominates any other solution. More precisely, the dominance relation they obtain is as follows:CEA≻LCE≻LPin≻LP≻LCELThen, the Proportional solution only dominates CEL, which is the most favorable solution for larger claimants relative to smaller ones (so, the less equitable one).15See Bosmans and Lauwers (2011) for additional relationships.15Among the solutions analyzed in Bosmans and Lauwers (2011), only CEA dominates the αmin-Egalitarian solution. Next result shows the Lorenz relationships between our solution and the ones on that paper.Proposition 7(a)The αmin-Egalitarian solution Lorenz dominates P and CEL.There is no Lorenz domination between the αmin-Egalitarian solution and CE, Pin, RA, MO, T, and AP solutions.Part (b), with respect to CE and Pin is directly obtained from Examples 2 and 3. Moreover, Example 3 shows a claims problem in which the αmin-Egalitarian solution Lorenz dominates RA, MO, T and AP. Next example shows a case in which these solutions are not Lorenz dominated by the αmin-Egalitarian solution.Example 5Let (E,c)=(20,(2,20,40)). Then,ciφminRA=MOAPT220.660.961.9206.59.669.529.54011.59.669.529.5Proof of part (a) is given in Appendix A6.In this paper we have proposed a compromise between the two most important and well-known ways of solving distribution problems: the Proportional and the Egalitarian. Moreover, we have analyzed the properties of this new solution and defined a recursive process, Self-composition, which allows us to recover the Constrained Equal Awards solution, by using our solution.A natural question arises at this point: if we consider an alternative solution concept (e.g. Talmud solution, T) and we define in an analogous wayφαT=αT+(1-α)EAα∈[0,1],can we obtain withφminTall the results we have obtained with φmin? The answer is negative, as we have yet mentioned. The main result, that shows the equivalence between finding the α∗ and applying φmin, or assigning to each agent the smallest claim and distribute the remaining estate by using the Talmud solution, is no longer true, as the following example shows:Example 6Consider (E,c)=(4500,(500,2000,3500)). Then, T(E,c)=(250,1375,2875), EA(E,c)=(1500,1500,1500), α∗=0.8, and we obtain:φminT=(500,1400,2600)But, if we compute (500,500,500)+T(3000,(0,1500,3000))=(500,500,500)+(0,750,2250)=(500,1250,2750), which is a different result.Note that the αmin-Egalitarian solution can be also understood as a kind of “Constrained Proportional” solution in the sense that it can be used to ensure a minimum amount to any agent. Suppose that a small amountc̃<c1must be received by each agent.16Such situations can be found, for instance, in the distribution of a heritage; or the State’s guarantee of a minimum retirement pension; fixing a minimal fishing quota, or milk quota; …16What remains of the estate, if any, is shared proportionally among all agents. Then, given a claims problem (E,c) this distribution can be obtained by using the αmin-Egalitarian solution in the following way:φ(E,c)≔φmin(E+c̃,c∗)c∗=(c0=c̃,c1,…,cn)where only the last n−components of the αmin-Egalitarian solution are considered. This interpretation can be used, as we have mentioned in the Introduction, to obtain the distribution of seats in Spanish Parliament among districts. The Spanish system guarantees two seats to any district. The other seats are distributed to districts proportional to the population. Then, by applying the αmin-Egalitarian solution withc̃=2we obtain the actual distribution of seats.Finally, we want to point out a possible way of extending our results by considering a more general class of problems, with claims and constraints simultaneously (see Bergantiños & Lorenzo (2008)).
