@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provides a non-invasive and inexpensive technique for analyzing heart activity under various cardiac conditions. Further, the proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks makes it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring. However, although considerable attention has been paid to automated detection and classification of heartbeats from ECG data, classifier learning strategies have never been used to deal with individual variations in cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic classification of an individual׳s ECG beats for Holter monitoring. We use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to accurately extract features such as the QRS complex and P wave, and employ a decision tree to classify each beat in terms of these features. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database before and after personalization of the decision tree using a patient׳s own ECG data yield heartbeat classification accuracies of 94.6% and 99%, respectively. These are comparable to results obtained from state-of-the-art schemes, validating the efficacy of our proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat or abnormal heart rhythm. The symptoms of arrhythmia are diverse, from minor chest palpitations to a sudden heart attack. If detected at a late stage, arrhythmia is liable to recur frequently, and this is associated with a high risk of death [1]. It is therefore important for patients showing symptoms of arrhythmia, however mild, to be diagnosed as early as possible. Unfortunately, many patients are unaware of their symptoms or are unwilling to visit a hospital, and even those who seek diagnosis may exhibit normal cardiac behavior during their visit. Consequently, there is growing demand for a remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system that can function continuously and at any location.Fortunately, the recently developed Holter monitoring device can be integrated with modern smartphones to serve precisely this function (seeFig. 1), allowing patients to continue their normal routines while their ECG data are sent over a wireless network to a monitoring center for interpretation. If a decision support system identifies a dangerous condition, it alerts medical staffs at the monitoring center, who make a diagnosis and then inform the patient immediately, instructing them as to the most appropriate action to take.Individual heartbeats in ECG data are primarily characterized by five peaks and valleys (labeled P, Q, R, S, and T) [2], and these can be used to detect arrhythmia. A number of successful arrhythmia classification systems [3–16] have been reported; however, none of these systems take individual cardiac peculiarities into account, even though it has been demonstrated that individuals of the same age, sex, weight, and height can have completely different baseline ECG patterns [17]. It has even been suggested that individuals could be identified by their ECG signals [17,18].On the basis of these ideas, we propose a new method for arrhythmia classification of an individual׳s heartbeats by Holter monitoring. Specifically, we use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm [2] to accurately extract ECG features, and then use a decision tree to classify beats according to these features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this decision tree classifier by means of extensive experiments using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database [19].Our work makes the following two main contributions: (1) a systematic design methodology for a remote ECG monitoring system, and (2) a more accurate classification method that reduces the number of false alarms and missing events by considering more types of heartbeat.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly review work related to ECG feature detection and classification. Section 3 presents our proposed method for extracting features and classifying an individual׳s ECG beats. In Section 4, we profile our experimental dataset, before Sections 5 and 6 present and analyze our experimental results. Finally, in Section 7, we give some concluding remarks and outline possible directions for future study.
