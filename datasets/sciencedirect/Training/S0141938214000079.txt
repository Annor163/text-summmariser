@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Phosphorescent white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) based on single doped platinum(II) [1,3-difluoro-4,6-di(2-pyridinyl)benzene] chloride (Pt-4) emission layers were investigated in this paper. The devices exhibited electroluminescence spectra composed of bluish (λmax=480nm) and reddish (λmax=660nm) emission bands, which corresponding to monomer and excimer emission originated from Pt-4 dopants. With optimized device structures, a maximum current efficiency of 11.5cd/A was obtained and remained above 10cd/A even the brightness was over 6000cd/m2. Furthermore, by integrating the fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) as a complementary emitter and an additional 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-phenylene)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) space layer, the device efficiency was further improved, which exhibited a maximum current efficiency of 20.4cd/A at the luminance of 100cd/m2, and maintained the mild efficiency roll-off that similar to its single Pt-4 doped counterpart.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiency have been attracted broad attention for their future application as full-color display and solid-state lighting [1–3]. To improve efficiency, organic phosphorescent complexes [4] are widely utilized in white-light OLEDs, owing to their harvesting of both triplet and singlet excitons inducing internal quantum efficiency of 100% [5]. However, it has been identified that the efficiency roll-off is one of the main drawbacks of phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) due to triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) which occurs as the current density increased [6,7]. Additionally, the triplet states can readily diffuse more than 1000Å due to their long exciton lifetimes, which may lead to nonradiative decay by triplet quenching process in the luminescent layer [8]. Thus, it is critical to use device configurations that confine the triplet excitons within the emission layer (EML) [9].In terms of white emission from OLEDs, it has been shown that the broad electroluminescence (EL) spectra could be obtained by incorporation of a multiple-doped emission zone (multiple-doped emissive layer [10] or multilayer of emitters [11,12]). These approaches have been demonstrated to achieve high color-rendering indices (CRI) and high efficiency for illumination application. However, they have inherent defects due to energy transfer process between different emitters, leading to unstable emission color for WOLEDs [13,14].It has been reported that the problems mentioned above could be solved by utilizing the blue phosphorescence dopant of platinum(II) [1,3-difluoro-4,6-di(2-pyridinyl)benzene] chloride (Pt-4) in WOLEDs [15,16]. By combining the sky-blue monomer emission peaked at 480nm and red excimer emission at 660nm that originated from single Pt-4 dopants, white-light emission has been achieved. Although Yang et al. demonstrated the use of Pt-4 as a single emissive layer to fabricate white-light OLED devices, which exhibited a two-peak emission EL spectrum and good Commission Internationale de L′Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) [16], the devices’ chromatic stability was rather poor. Recently, Xiong et al. solved this problem by using a green fluorescence material, N,N′-di(n-butyl)-1,3,8,10-teramethylquinacridone (TMDBQA), as the complementary dopant, which improve the chromatic stability and achieved a CRI of 94 [17]. However, its current efficiency needs to be further improved for practical application. Hence, this work in this paper made an emphasis on how to improve the current efficiency and reduce the efficiency roll-off of WOLEDs based on Pt-4.White-light OLEDs were fabricated on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. Before evaporation, ITO glasses were cleaned by deionized water, detergent water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, sequentially, and dried in nitrogen gas flow prior to about 10min oxygen plasma treatment. Organic materials and a metallic layer were deposited using a conventional thermal evaporation system without breaking the vacuum system. During the evaporation process, the vacuum degree was about 10−6mbar. The deposition rate and layer thickness were controlled in situ using quartz crystal oscillator monitors. For characterization of device performance, the current–voltage-luminance characteristics were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter and a PR-655 luminance meter. All measurements were performed at ambient atmosphere under room temperature.Two groups of devices were fabricated during the experimental process. For all devices in Group A and Group B, 4,4′-bis[N-(1-napthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) was used as hole transporting layer (HTL), 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) was used as electron blocking layer (EBL), N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP) doped with 8wt.% Pt-4 was used as EML, 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-phenylene)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) was used as hole blocking layer (HBL), and LiF was used as electron injection layer (EIL). In addition, 4″,4′′′-N,N-diphenylamine-4-4′-diphenyl-1,1′-binaphthyl (BN1) [18] was introduced in devices for studying the generation region of excitons. The device structures in Group A are as follows.Device A1: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).Device A2: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/BN1(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).Device A3: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/BN1(5nm)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).In Group B, the fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) [Ir(ppy)3] doped TPBi emissive layer was introduced, and an additional thin film of TPBi was used as the space layer to balance the charge carriers. The device structures in Group B are reproduced below.Device B1: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).Device B2: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(1nm)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).Device B3: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(2nm)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).
