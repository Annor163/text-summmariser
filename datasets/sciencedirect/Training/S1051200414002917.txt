@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Joint detection and estimation (JDE) of a target refers to determining the existence of the target and estimating the state of the target, if the target exists. This paper studies the error bounds for JDE of an unresolved target-group in the presence of clutter and missed detection using the random finite set (RFS) framework. We define a meaningful distance error for JDE of the unresolved target-group by modeling the state as a Bernoulli RFS. We derive the single and multiple sensor bounds on the distance error for an unresolved target-group observation model, which is based on the concept of the continuous individual target number. Maximum a posterior (MAP) detection criteria and unbiased estimation criteria are used in deriving the bounds. Examples 1 and 2 show the variation of the bounds with the probability of detection and clutter density for single and multiple sensors. Example 3 verifies the effectiveness of the bounds by indicating the performance limitations of an unresolved target-group cardinalized probability hypothesis density (UCPHD) filter.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In target tracking, most of the tracking algorithms are suboptimal because of nonlinearity, non-Gaussian noises, clutter, missed detection, and measurement origination uncertainty [1, pp. 1–52]. In order to assess the achievable performance of the suboptimal filters, we need to derive their error lower bounds, which give an indication of performance limitations. In 1998, Tichavsky et al. [2] proposed a recursive posterior Cramér–Rao lower bound (PCRLB) for evaluating the performance of existing suboptimal nonlinear filters. The PCRLB has been extended to the tracking problems where clutter is present [3–5], probability of detection is less than unity [6,7], and a target maneuvers [8].The problem of joint detection and estimation (JDE) is an important research and has been studied in [9–11]. Tajer et al. [12] offered a new framework for joint target detection and parameter estimation using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. Moustakides et al. [13] developed the optimum one- and two-step test for the JDE setup by combing the Bayesian formulation of the estimation sub-problem with suitable constraints on the detection sub-problem. Vo et al. [14] developed a multi-Bernoulli track before detect (TBD) filter for the JDE of non-overlapping objects using image observations with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).The PCRLB rests on the assumption that the target must exist. In other words, the PCRLB only refers to the estimation error but not the detection error. Therefore, it is very difficult to be applicable to the performance evaluation of the JDE approaches. Rezaeian et al. [15] derived the single sensor mean square error (MSE) bounds for the JDE of a single point target based on the random finite set (RFS). Tong et al. [16] presented recursive forms of error bounds for the RFS state and observation when the probability of detection is less than unity without clutter. The research on error bounds is very valuable for many real-world applications, such as sensor management [17], ballistic target tracking [18], performance prediction, and passive tracking [19,20].Unresolved targets (or target-groups) tracking (UTT), proposed first by Drummond, Blackman and Petrisor in 1990 [21], has become an important research in recent years. The problem of UTT arises because of the sensor resolution, high normalized target density, and sensor-to-target geometry [22,23]. An unresolved target-group refers to a cluster of two or more closely spaced individual targets, which cannot be completely resolved due to finite sensor resolution. In other words, treating a cluster of indistinguishable point targets as an entire object (especially if they move in a coordinated fashion according to a certain constraint or interrelationship, it is usually reasonable to treat them as an entire object), they are idealized as an unresolved target-group [24]. In [25, pp. 432–433], an unresolved target-group is also called a “point target cluster”. In general, the number of detections generated by target-group will be different from the number of individual targets in the target-group due to finite sensor resolution, sensor missed detection, and clutter as shown in Fig. 1.Above all, an unresolved target-group of this paper is an entire object rather than only one point target. It is formed by a cluster of indistinguishable point targets.Many approaches have been proposed for UTT. A comprehensive overview of existing approaches to UTT up to 2004 is provided in [26]. Blair and Keel discuss the significance of finite radar resolution in the context of UTT in [23]. Koch et al. [27,28] devised an approximate Bayesian solution to jointly estimating the geometric centroid and ellipsoidal shape of an unresolved target-group or extended target. A new variant of probabilistic multiple hypotheses tracker (PMHT) [29], which permits that multiple measurements originate from the same object, could be applied for UTT. Blom et al. [30] and Jeong et al. [31], respectively, studied the single and multiple sensor Bayesian filtering algorithms for maneuvering UTT. Nandakumaran et al. [32] and Gorji et al. [33], respectively, proposed JDE algorithms for UTT using monopulse radar and colocated MIMO radar. Within the RFS framework, Mahler developed a novel probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter for JDE of unresolved target-groups [34]. Then, the authors extended the method to unresolved target-group cardinalized PHD (UCPHD) filter [35] and unresolved target-group multi-Bernoulli filter [36]. Mihaylova et al. [37] presented an overview of Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo methods for UTT. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on the JDE error bounds for UTT until now.In this paper, we first present a meaningful distance error for the JDE of an unresolved target-group by modeling the state as a Bernoulli RFS. An observation model based on the concept of continuous target number is used to describe the likelihood function for the unresolved target-group according to [25, pp. 437–440]. Then we derive the single and multiple sensor bounds on the distance error for JDE of an unresolved target-group in the presence of missed detection and clutter. Maximum a posterior (MAP) detection criteria and unbiased estimation criteria are used in deriving the bounds. Finally, three numerical examples are presented using simulated data. Examples 1 and 2 show the variation of the bounds with probability of detection and clutter density in the cases of single sensor and multiple sensors. Example 3 verifies the effectiveness of the bounds by indicating the performance limitations of a UCPHD filter [35].In the current set up of this paper, our attention is restricted to the static JDE problem of a single unresolved target-group. Our future work will study the recursive extensions to the filtering problems by consideration of the unresolved target-group state evolution.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem for JDE of an unresolved target-group based on the RFS. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the single and multiple sensor MSE bounds for the JDE of an unresolved target-group, respectively. We present three numerical examples in Section 5. Conclusions and future work are given in Section 6. Relevant mathematical proofs of these conclusions are presented in Appendices A–D.An unresolved target-group state is modeled by an augmented vector of form(1)x′=(a,x)∈X′,where the l-dimensional vectorx=[x1,…,xl]T∈Rldenotes a conventional single-target state, a denotes the expected number of individual targets involved in the unresolved target-group. Here we assume that the dimension of the state for each individual target in the group is the same.x′models a cluster of a individual targets colocated at the single statex. According to the concept of continuous individual target number proposed by Mahler [25, pp. 437–440],a∈A⊂R+is a positive real number.X′denotes the state space of a single unresolved target-group,X′⊂R+×Rl.We consider the problem of JDE of an unresolved target-group within the Bayesian framework. Therefore, the prior knowledge about the unresolved target-group must be used. We assume that the number of the unresolved target-groups in the surveillance area is at most one. Therefore, it is suitable to model the state setX′of the unresolved target-group as a Bernoulli RFSX′∼BX′(r,f(x′))with the probability density(2)π(X′)={1−r,forX′=∅,rf(x′),forX′={x′},wherer∈[0,1]denotes the probability ofX′≠∅,f(x′)(defined onX′) denotes the probability density ofx′. r represents the prior existence probability of an unresolved target-group andf(x′)represents the prior knowledge about statex′if it exists. Therefore, the Bernoulli densityπ(X′)encapsulates all the prior information about the unresolved target-group.Letz=[z1,…,zm]T∈Z⊂Rmdenote an m-dimensional measurement received by a sensor and Z the set of sensor measurements, whereZis the observation space.For any real-valued functionh(z), we define(3)hZ={∏z∈Zh(z),forZ≠∅,1,forZ=∅.The measurements originate either from an unresolved target-group or from random clutter. Moreover, the target-generated measurements are independent from the clutter-generated measurements. Hence, Z is described as(4)Z=Zt(x′)∪Zc,whereZt(x′)denotes the measurement set originated from an unresolved target-group with statex′,Zcdenotes the clutter set. The likelihood functiong(Zt(x′)|x′)for an unresolved target-group according to [25, pp. 437–440] is(5)g(Zt(x′)|x′)=|Zt(x′)|!⋅ϑ|Zt(x′)|(a,Po(x))(ϕ(z|x))Zt(x′),where|Z|denotes the cardinality of a set Z,Po(x)denotes the probability that an observation will at least be collected by the sensor from the unresolved target,ϕ(z|x)denotes the single measurement single target likelihood density,ϑm(a,Po(x))denotes a generalized binomial distribution on integersm≥0.ϑm(a,Po(x))is defined by its probability generating functionGa,Po(x)(q)(6)ϑm(a,Po(x))≜1m!⋅dmGa,Po(x)dqm(0),(7)Ga,Po(x)(q)≜∏i=0∞(1−σ(a−i)Po(x)+σ(a−i)Po(x)q),whereσ(a)is a sigmoidal function [25, pp. 437–440].The clutter setZcis modeled as a Poisson RFS with the density(8)κ(Zc)=e−λυZc,whereυ(z)denotes the clutter intensity,(9)υ(z)=λfc(z),where λ is the average clutter number,fc(z)is the density of clutter spatial distribution.Letei(X′,Xˆ′)denote the ith (i=1,…,l+1) component's error between the actual state setX′and estimated state setXˆ′of an unresolved target-group. SinceX′andXˆ′can have only cardinality zero or one, there are only four possibilities forei(X′,Xˆ′):(10){ei(X′=∅,Xˆ′=∅)=0,ei(X′={x′},Xˆ′={xˆ′})=xi′−xˆi′,ei(X′=∅,Xˆ′={xˆ′})≜e0,i,ei(X′={x′},Xˆ′=∅)≜e1,i,wheree0,iande1,ican be explained as the false alarm error and missed detection error of the ith componentxi′, respectively.It is noted that1)The metricei(X′,Xˆ′)must obey the triangle inequality, which is an important property for a principled performance measure. This would mean(11)ei({x′},{xˆ′})=xi′−xˆi′≤ei({x′},∅)+ei(∅,{xˆ′})=e1,i+e0,i,i=1,…,l+1,which must be guaranteed for allx′andxˆ′.ei(X′,Xˆ′)is the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metric [38] if(12)e1,i=e0,i≥|xi′−xˆi′|,∀x′,xˆ′∈X′,i=1,…,l+1.However, we permit that the results established in the paper hold for more general values ofe0,iande1,i(non-symmetric distance), so one can penalize the two cardinality errors differently.The paper aims to derive the performance limits of unresolved target-group joint detectors–estimators, which are measured by the bounds ofei(X′,Xˆ′), for single or multiple sensors.Within RFS framework, the ith (i=1,…,l+1) state component's MSE for JDE of an unresolved target-group based on a single sensor is defined by the metricei(X′,Xˆ′(Z)),(13)σi2=E[ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))]=∫Z∫X′f(X′,Z)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))δX′δZ=∫Z∫X′γ(Z|X′)f(X′)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))δX′δZ,whereE[⋅]denotes the expectation operation,f(X′,Z)denotes the joint density of two RFSsX′and Z,γ(Z|X′)=f(Z|X′)denotes the observation likelihood function,∫Z⋅δZis a set integral and is defined by [39, pp. 141–144](14)∫Zf(Z)δZ≜∑n=0∞1n!∫Znf(Zn)dz1⋯dzn=f(∅)+∑n=1∞1n!∫Znf(Zn)dz1⋯dznwith(15)Zn={z1,…,zn}∈Zndenoting|Z|=n. LetZ0=∅.From (4), (8) and (11.253) in [25, pp. 385–386], the likelihood functionγ(Z|X′)for the total measurement process modeled in (2) can be derived as(16)γ(Z|X′=∅)=e−λυZ,(17)γ(Z|X′={x′})=∑Y⊆Zg(Y|x′)κ(Z−Y)=(1−Po(x))κ(Z)+Po(x)∑Y⊆Z,Y≠∅g(Y|x′)κ(Z−Y)=e−λυZ(1−Po(x)+Po(x)∑Y⊆Z,Y≠∅g(Y|x′)υ−Y),whereZ−Ydenotes the complement of Y in Z.MAP detection criterion, which is applied to decide whether the unresolved target-group exists or not, must be imposed for deriving the JDE error bounds. The reason for this will be clearly stated at the end of the section. Lemma 1 shows the relationship between the existence of the unresolved target-group and the single-sensor measurement space according to the MAP detection criterion.Lemma 1Given Bernoulli state RFSX′in(2)and single-sensor observation RFS Z in(4), the MAP detector for the unresolved target-group assignsXˆ′=∅if and only ifZ∈Z0=Z−Z¯0, where(18)Z¯0={Z∈Z:β(Z)≥1−rr},(19)β(Z)=∫X′f(x′)(1−Po(x)+Po(x)∑Y⊆Z,Y≠∅g(Y|x′)υ−Y)dx′.The proof of Lemma 1 can be found in Appendix A.Information inequality [40, pp. 169–171, 186] is presented here for proving Theorems 1 and 2: Given a joint probability densityf(x,z)onX×Z, under regularity conditions and the existence of∂2log⁡f(x,z)/∂xi∂xj, the following inequality holds,(20)σe,i2=∫Z∫Xf(x,z)(xi−xˆi(z))2dxdz≥[J−1]i,i,wherexˆi(z)is an unbiased estimate of the ith componentxiof the vectorxbased on observationz,σe,i2is the MSE ofxˆi(z), J is Fisher information matrix,(21)[J]i,j=−Ef[∂2log⁡f(x,z)∂xi∂xj]=−∫Z∫Xf(x,z)∂2log⁡f(x,z)∂xi∂xjdxdz,where the ‘=’ in (20) holds if and only if the conditional probability densityf(x|z)obeys the Gaussian distribution.Theorem 1Given the Bernoulli state model in(2)and measurement model in(4), the single-sensor MSE of the ith(i=1,…,l+1)state component for joint MAP detection and unbiased estimation of an unresolved target-group is bounded by(22)σi2≥(1−r)e0,i2eλ0−λ+r∑n=0∞Ωnn!([J¯n−1]i,i+e1,i2(1−ω¯n)),where(23)λ0=∫Z¯0,1υ(z)dz,(24)[J¯n]i,j=−1ω¯n2∫Z¯0,n∫X′p(x′,Zn)∂2log⁡p(x′,Zn)∂xi′∂xj′dx′dz1⋯dzn,(25)ω¯n=∫Z¯0,n∫X′p(x′,Zn)dx′dz1⋯dzn,where the integral regionZ¯0,nis obtained byLemma 1,p(x′,Zn)denotes the joint probability density of(x′,Zn)andΩnis its normalizing factor,(26)p(x′,Zn)=1Ωne−λυZnf(x′)(1−Po(x)+Po(x)∑Y⊆Zn,Y≠∅g(Y|x′)υ−Y),(27)Ωn=e−λλn∫X′f(x′)(1−Po(x)+Po(x)∑k=1nn!ϑk(a,Po(x))(n−k)!λk)dx′.The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Appendix B.Explanations:1)It is necessary to impose MAP detection rule for deriving the JDE error bounds in Theorem 1, although the minimum MSE defined by (13) may not be achieved with the constraint. The reason for this is: From the single-sensor MSE expression in (58), it can be seen that the estimator is intricately interconnected with the detector via the integration regionsZ0and its complementZ¯0, which are defined by the detector. Nevertheless, the unresolved target-group detection without MAP criterion needs to minimize the MSE of (58), which is dependent on the choice ofZ0orZ¯0. So it is extremely complex in definingZ0for the detector that minimizes the MSE of (58) due to the interrelation of the detector and estimator. As a result, without this MAP detector restriction, characterizing the joint detector–estimator that achieves minimum MSE of (58) is nearly impossible. For the same reason, the MAP detector restriction must be imposed in Theorem 2, too.Obviously, in order to derive the JDE bounds of an unresolved target-group within Bayesian framework, r andf(x′), which are all the prior information of unresolved target-group Bernoulli state setX′, must be given.The unresolved target-group is observed by S independent sensors in the surveillance region. The superscript ‘s’ is used to denote the corresponding parameter of the sth sensor. For example,Zs=Zts(x′)∪Zcs∈Zs,ns,Pos(x),gs(⋅|x′),υs(⋅)andγs(Z|X′)=fs(Z|X′)denote the observation set, measurement number, probability of detection, unresolved target-group likelihood, clutter intensity and observation likelihood function of the sth sensor, respectively.Within RFS framework, the ith (i=1,…,l+1) state component's MSE for JDE of an unresolved target-group using S independent sensors with centralized fusion architecture is defined by the metricei(X′,Xˆ′(Z1,…,ZS)),(28)σS,i2=E[ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z1,…,ZS))]=∫Z1⋯∫ZS∫X′f(X′,Z1,…,ZS)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z1,…,ZS))δX′δZ1⋯δZS=∫Z1⋯∫ZS∫X′γ1(Z1|X′)⋯γS(ZS|X′)f(X′)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Z1,…,ZS))δX′δZ1⋯δZS,wheref(X′,Z1,…,ZS)denotes the joint density of the RFSsX′andZ1,…,ZS.Note that two basic fusion architectures are well known: centralized and distributed. They have advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance, channel requirements, reliability, survivability, information sharing, etc. [41]. Only the centralized fusion architecture is considered in the paper for the following reasons:1)The best performance of the JDE can theoretically be achieved by using the centralized fusion architecture since there is no information loss in a centralized processing approach [42,43].Within RFS framework, the ith (i=1,…,l+1) state component's MSE for the JDE of an unresolved target-group using S independent sensors with distributed fusion architecture is defined by(29)σ⌢S,i2=E[ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S))]=∫Xˆ′1⋯∫Xˆ′S∫X′f(X′,Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S))δX′δXˆ′1⋯δXˆ′S=∫Xˆ′1⋯∫Xˆ′S∫X′f1(Xˆ′1|X′)⋯fS(Xˆ′S|X′)f(X′)ei2(X′,Xˆ′(Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S))δX′δXˆ′1⋯δXˆ′S,whereXˆ′sdenotes the sth sensor's estimate ofX′based onZs,s=1,…,S,Xˆ′(Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S)denotes the global estimate ofX′based on all of the local estimatesXˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S,f(X′,Xˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S)denotes the joint density of the RFSsX′andXˆ′1,…,Xˆ′S. Herefs(Xˆ′s|X′)denotes the conditional density ofXˆ′sgivenX′. It is very difficult to obtain the complex densityfs(Xˆ′s|X′)within the RFS framework. We are sorry that we were not able to obtain the bound onσ⌢S,i2due to lack of the explicit expression offs(Xˆ′s|X′). Our future work will study the proposed bound for the distributed fusion architecture. In fact, we have obtained some results in this area. However, the results are tentative and need to be further studied.The MSE bound on joint MAP detection and unbiased estimation of an unresolved target-group based on S independent sensors with centralized fusion architecture is obtained by Lemma 2 and Theorem 2.Lemma 2Given Bernoulli state RFSX′in(2)and observation RFSsZ1,…,ZSfrom S independent sensors with centralized fusion architecture, where each ofZ1,…,ZSobeys the measurement model in(4), the MAP detector for the unresolved target-group assignsXˆ′=∅if and only ifZ1,…,ZS∈Z01,…,Z0S=Z1,…,ZS−Z¯01,…,Z¯0S, where(30)Z¯01,…,Z¯0S={Z1,…,ZS∈Z1,…,ZS:β(Z1,…,ZS)≥1−rr},(31)β(Z1,…,ZS)=∫X′f(x′)∏s=1S(1−Pos(x)+Pos(x)∑Ys⊆Zs,Ys≠∅gs(Ys|x′)(υs)−Ys)dx′,(32)gs(Ys|x′)=|Ys|!ϑ|Ys|(a,Pos(x))(ϕs(zs|x))Ys,s=1,…,S.The proof of Lemma 2 can be found in Appendix C.Theorem 2Given the Bernoulli state model in(2)and S independent sensors with centralized fusion architecture, where each of the sensors obeys the measurement model in(4), the multiple-sensor MSE of the ith(i=1,…,l+1)state component for joint MAP detection and unbiased estimation of an unresolved target-group is bounded by(33)σS,i2≥(1−r)e0,i2e∑s=1S(λ0s−λs)+r∑nS=0∞⋯∑n1=0∞Ωn1,…,nSnS!⋯n1!([J¯n1,…,nS−1]i,i+e1,i2(1−ω¯n1,…,nS)),where(34)λ0s=∫Z¯0,1sυs(zs)dzs,s=1,…,S,(35)[J¯n1,…,nS]i,j=−1ω¯n1,…,nS2∫Z¯0,nSS⋯∫Z¯0,n11∫X′p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)∂2log⁡p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)∂xi′∂xj′dx′dz11⋯dzn11⋯dz1S⋯dznSS,(36)ω¯n1,…,nS=∫Z¯0,nSS⋯∫Z¯0,n11∫X′p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)dx′dz11⋯dzn11⋯dz1S⋯dznSS,where the integral regionsZ¯0,n11,…,Z¯0,nSSare obtained byLemma 2,p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)denotes the joint probability density of(x′,Zn11,...,ZnSS)andΩn1,…,nSis its normalizing factor,(37)p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)=f(x′)Ωn1,…,nS∏s=1Se−λs(υs)Znss(1−Pos(x)+Pos(x)∑Ys⊆Znss,Ys≠∅gs(Ys|x′)(υs)−Ys),(38)Ωn1,…,nS=∏s=1Se−λs(λs)ns∫X′f(x′)∏s=1S(1−Pos(x)+Pos(x)∑k=1nsns!ϑk(a,Pos(x))(ns−k)!(λs)k)dx′.The proof of Theorem 2 can be found in Appendix D.Consider a two-dimensional scenario with at most one unresolved target-group observed by a single sensor in the surveillance regionA=[−A/2,A/2]×[−A/2,A/2]. The state of the unresolved target-group isx′=(a,x), wherex=[x,y]Tdenote the position vector in X-axis and in Y-axis, respectively. The state setX′is assumed to be a Bernoulli RFSX′∼BX′(r,f(x′))with(39)f(x′)=f(a)f(x)=U(a;ε)N(x;x0,Q),whereU(⋅;ε)denotes the density of uniform distribution over the regionε=[a1,a2](a2>a1),N(⋅;x0,Q)denotes the density of Gaussian distribution with meanx0and covariance matrix Q.The single measurement single target densityϕ(z|x), included in theg(Z(x′)|x′)of (5), is(40)ϕ(z|x)=N(z;h(x),R),whereh(x)is the observation function, and R is the measurement noise covariance matrix.The detection probability of the sensor is assumed to be independent of the statex:Po(x)=Po.The clutter is modeled as a Poisson RFS with the intensityυ(z)=λU(z;A),U(⋅;A)denotes the density of uniform distribution over the surveillance regionA.Then, according to (19), (23), (26) and (27), we have(41)β(Z)=1−Po+Poa2−a1∑Y⊆Z,Y≠∅|Y|!(A2λ)|Y|⋅∫a1a2ϑ|Y|(a,Po)da∫XN(x;x0,Q)∏z∈YN(z;h(x),R)dx,(42)λ0=λA2∫Z¯0,1dz,(43)p(x′,Zn)=e−λN(x;x0,Q)Ωn(a2−a1)(1−Po+Po∑Y⊆Zn,Y≠∅|Y|!⋅ϑ|Y|(a,Po)(λA2)n−|Y|∏z∈YN(z;h(x),R)),(44)Ωn=e−λλn(1−Po+Poa2−a1∑k=1nn!∫a1a2ϑk(a,Po)da(n−k)!λk).The calculation formulas ofJ¯nandω¯nare obtained by substituting (41)–(44) into (24) and (25). Finally, the single-sensor MSE bound onσi2(i=1,2,3)for JDE of the unresolved target-group is obtained by (22). It is noted that1)The calculation formula ofJ¯nin (25) can be easily obtained by the software Mathematica 8.0.1.The Monte Carlo (MC) integration method [44] is used to compute the numerical values ofω¯nandJ¯nsince there are no analytic forms ofω¯nandJ¯n.In this example, we assume thate0,12=40,e0,22=200,e0,32=400,e1,12=60,e1,22=300,e1,32=500,A=100,r=0.6,[a1,a2]=[2,8],x0=[50],Q=[251010100],h(x)=[x2+y2arctan⁡yx],R=[250.01].The single-sensor bounds onσi2(i=1,2,3)are shown as function ofPoand λ in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 shows that givenPo, the single-sensor bounds onσi2(i=1,2,3)are nonlinear functions of λ and do not always increase with λ whenPo<1. They reach the peaks atλ=λ⁎(Po). As presented in Fig. 2,λ⁎(Po)decreases asPobecomes lower. A reasonable explanation is: whenPois relatively low and λ exceeds a certainλ⁎(Po), the increase of λ instead reduces the possibility for missed detection errore1,i, which results in decreasing the total MSE bound. Moreover, it can been seen from Fig. 2 that given λ, the single-sensor bounds onσi2do not always decrease asPobecomes higher. With the increase of λ, the bounds corresponding to the largePogradually exceed the bounds corresponding to the lowPo. A reason for this is: when the clutter density is relatively low (such asλ<150in this example), largerPocould result in less possibility for missed detection errore1,i, which is helpful in decreasing the total MSE bounds. Contrarily, when the clutter density is relatively high (such asλ>270in this example), largerPocould result in more possibility for false alarm errore0,i, which is helpful in increasing the total MSE bounds.In this example, the unresolved target-group is observed by S independent sensors with centralized fusion architecture in the same surveillance regionA. The model of the unresolved target-group state setX′is the same as that of Example 1. The single measurement single target density and Poisson clutter intensity of the sth sensor are modeled asϕs(zs|x)=N(zs;hs(x),Rs)andυs(zs)=λsU(zs;A),s=1,…,S, respectively. For each of the sensors, the detection probability is assumed to be independent ofx:Pos(x)=Pos,s=1,…,S.Then, according to (31), (34), (37) and (38), we have(45)β(Z1,…,ZS)=1a2−a1∫a1a2∫XN(x;x0,Q)∏s=1S(1−Pos+Pos∑Ys⊆Zs,Ys≠∅|Ys|!⋅ϑ|Ys|(a,Pos)(A2λs)|Ys|∏zs∈YsN(zs;hs(x),Rs))dxda,(46)λ0s=λsA2∫Z¯0,1sdzs,(47)p(x′,Zn11,…,ZnSS)=N(x;x0,Q)Ωn1,…,nS(a2−a1)∏s=1Se−λs(1−Pos+Pos∑Ys⊆Znss,Ys≠∅|Ys|!⋅ϑ|Ys|(a,Pos)(λsA2)ns−|Ys|∏zs∈YsN(zs;hs(x),Rs)),(48)Ωn1,…,nS=∏s=1Se−λs(λs)ns(1−Pos+Posa2−a1∑k=1nsns!∫a1a2ϑk(a,Pos)da(ns−k)!(λs)k).The calculation formulas ofJ¯n1,…,nSandω¯n1,…,nSare obtained by substituting (45)–(48) into (35) and (36). Finally, the MSE bound onσS,i2(i=1,2,3)for JDE of the unresolved target-group based on the S independent sensors is obtained by (33).In this example, the number of the sensors over the regionAisS=3. For convenience, we assume thatλ1=λ2=λ3=λ,Po1=Po2=Po3=Po. The parameterse0,i2,e1,i2(i=1,…,3), A, r,[a1,a2],x0, Q are the same as those of Example 1. Sensor 1 here is the same as the sensor of Example 1, too. Thehs(x)andRsof the sth (s=2,3) sensor are:h2(x)=(x−10)2+(y+10)2,R2=36;h3(x)=arctan⁡y−10x+10,R3=0.04.In Fig. 3, the multiple-sensor bounds onσS,i2(i=1,2,3)are shown as function ofPoand λ, and are compared with the single-sensor bounds onσi2(i=1,2,3)of Example 1.For the multiple-sensors scenario, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that:1)GivenPo, the multiple-sensor bounds onσS,i2(i=1,2,3)are nonlinear functions of λ and do not always increase with λ whenPo<1. The reason for this is similar with that of the single-sensor bounds onσi2in Fig. 2.GivenPo, the multiple-sensor bound onσS,i2will exceed the single-sensor bound onσi2over the region where λ is bigger than a certainλS,i⁎(Po). Furthermore, the lowerPois, the smallerλS,i⁎(Po)is and the more significantly the multiple-sensor bound onσS,i2exceeds the single-sensor bound onσi2.Finally, a qualitative conclusion is derived from Figs. 2 and 3: the MSE bounds for JDE of an unresolved target-group do not always decrease as the increase of the sensors. Increasing the sensors which have relatively high detection probabilities and relatively low clutter densities generally results in reducing the MSE bounds. Contrarily, increasing the sensors which have very low detection probabilities or very high clutter density might result in increasing the MSE bounds. Similar with Examples 1 and 2, as long as the explicit parameters of a UTT scenario are given, the quantitative conclusions about its MSE bounds can be obtained by our results.In this example, the proposed single-sensor MSE bounds for JDE of an unresolved target-group are compared with the errors of the single-sensor UCPHD filter [35]. The maximum unresolved target-group number estimates from the UCPHD filter are restricted to 1. The errors of the UCPHD filters are measured by 500 MC run averages of the distances defined in (10). Since the current set up of the proposed bounds is restricted to the static JDE problem, we convert the dynamic UCPHD filtering algorithm to the relevant static method by the state evolution model(49)xk′=xk−1′.Given the scenarios and parameters of Example 1, Fig. 4compares the proposed single-sensor MSE bounds with the errors of the single-sensor UCPHD filter.It can be seen from Fig. 4 that1)Although the errors of single-sensor UCPHD filter are a little higher than the single-sensor bounds onσi2, both of them are always close versus λ andPo. It shows that the proposed MSE bounds give the effective indications of performance limitations for the UCPHD filter. The additional errors of UCPHD filter are mainly generated by the 1st moment approximation for the multi-target posterior and the clustering process involved in its particle implementation.The distances between the errors of UCPHD filter and the single-sensor bounds onσi2increase as λ becomes bigger or asPobecomes lower. A possibly reason for this is that the detection error and clustering error of the particle UCPHD filter increase as λ becomes bigger orPobecomes lower.The comparisons of errors of multiple-sensor UCPHD filter with the proposed multiple-sensor MSE bounds onσS,i2(i=1,2,3)are very similar with the single-sensor cases presented in Fig. 4, so they are not repeated here because of the space limitation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
According to the RFS and information inequality, we have derived the JDE error bounds for an unresolved target-group using single or multiple sensors in the presence of missed detection and clutter. The bounds are based on the proposed distance rather than the usual Euclidean distance. The proposed distance jointly captures the detection and estimation errors while the Euclidean distance only captures the estimation error. Three examples show the application of the bounds. Our future work will focus on the following four aspects:1)Studying the recursive extensions of the results to the filtering problems by consideration of the unresolved target-group state evolution.Extending the analysis to multiple unresolved target-groups and distributed fusion architecture.Analyzing the JDE problem in Neyman–Pearson-like detection framework [13] when the prior information of the unresolved target-group is unknown.Studying the sensor management strategies based on the results.
