Automatic labelling of anatomical landmarks on 3D body scans

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Geometrically salient points can be recognized by anatomists as meaningful locations on 3D human body scans.Automatic labelling based on spectral descriptors is able to reproduce this labelling.Location of these points is more accurate than automatic location of standard anthropometric landmarks.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we describe and test a pipeline for the extraction and semantic labelling of geometrically salient points on acquired human body models. Points of interest are extracted on the preprocessed scanned geometries as maxima of the autodiffusion function at different scales and annotated by an expert, where possible, with a corresponding semantic label related to a specific anatomical location.On the extracted points we computed several descriptors (e.g. Heat Kernel Signature, Wave Kernel Signature, Derivatives of Heat Kernel Signature) and used labels and descriptors to train supervised classifiers, in order to understand if it is possible to recognize the points on new models.Experimental results show that this approach can be used to detect and recognize robustly at least a selection of landmarks on subjects with different body types and independently on pose and could therefore applied for automatic anthropometric analysis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of 3D digital scanners to capture relevant information about human body shape is rapidly growing and not only limited to ergonomic studies or clothing design, but also for healthcare-related applications [1].To obtain quantitative parameters from the scans, it is, however, necessary to identify landmarks, perform specific measurements, extract geometrical descriptors of the shape that can be compared across different subjects and correlated, for example, with other diagnostic data. Most of the software tools used to process acquired models requires the use of specific acquisition protocols, with constraints on subject pose. This may create problems in comparing data acquired in different places and performing large-scale multicentric studies as well as in applying advanced shape analysis tools on the captured models.If we want to find meaningful anatomical landmarks, there is another relevant issue related to the fact that many points use in anatomical or anthropometric studies do not have a well defined geometrical characterization, being usually located through manual palpation. The local geometry is not only poorly characterized, but may be also relevantly different in subjects with different body built. For this reason, even using state of the art point matching methods, it is not possible to localize accurately those points in digital models, as revealed by a recent contest [2]. The error in locating standard anthropometric points (defined in the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry manual, www.isakonline.com), with registration based or spectral based methods was not negligible as these technique perform optimally in case of same shapes isometrically deformed and not in case of different body types.On the other hand, it is not necessary, to perform anthropometric studies, to rely on traditional landmarks, as shown, for example, in [3] where robust measurements are derived from curve-skeleton analysis and body segmentation and used to predict composition parameters. Similarly, we could derive new robust measurements exploiting the points on the body surface that can be easily characterized with their geometric properties, e.g. geometrically salient points. These measurements, clearly different from standard anthropometrical ones, but correlated with them, could be performed automatically and independently on acquisition resolution, quality, pose, etc.In this paper we present a study aimed at understanding if, among the surface points that can be characterized for geometric saliency on 3D scans, there are meaningful locations that can be automatically recognized on human scans with few quality constraints and large differences related to sex, body type and pose. These points can be used to extract quantitative measurements on the human body that can be then tested for repeatability and robustness and correlated with other parameters measured on the same subjects.To accomplish the task we extracted salient points at different scales exploiting the autodiffusion function (ADF), asked an expert to give them semantic labels, if possible, and characterized the points with several descriptors (pose invariant) encoding local and contextual information. Supervised classification tests have been then performed in order to understand which points can be successfully recognized, how the recognition depends on pose and body type and which are the automatic labelling algorithms providing the best accuracy.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of related work, Section 3 the complete processing and analysis pipeline, Section 4 the experimental tests performed and Section 5 a final discussion of the results.
