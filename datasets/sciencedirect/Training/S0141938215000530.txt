@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Dysprosium doped strontium calcium magnesium di-silicate phosphor namely: SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ was prepared by the solid state reaction method. The crystal structure of the prepared phosphor was an akermanite type structure, which belongs to the tetragonal crystallography with space group P42‾1m. From field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), agglomerations of particles were observed due to the high temperature synthesis process. The chemical composition of the sintered SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Under the ultra-violet (UV) excitation, the characteristic emission of Dy3+ ions peaking at 478, 580 and 674nm, originating from the transitions of 4F9/2→6H15/2, 4F9/2→6H13/2 and 4F9/2→6H11/2 in the 4f9 configuration of Dy3+. Commission International de I’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ are suitable as white light emitting phosphor. Decay graph indicate that this phosphor contains fast decay and slow decay process. The mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor increases linearly with increasing impact velocity of the moving piston, which suggests that this phosphor can be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus the present investigation indicates that the piezo-electrically induced de-trapping model is responsible to produce ML in SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The possible mechanism of white light emitting long lasting phosphor is also investigated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Scientists and researchers are conducting research in search for suitable host lattices that can be used to prepare phosphors for white light emitting phosphors. Current research topics on phosphors are focused on the generation of white light that can be used in light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1]. White LEDs have several advantages over conventional fluorescent lamps such as reduced power consumption, compactness, efficient light output, and longer lifetimes. The strategies used to produce white light in LEDs include combining blue LED with a yellow phosphor or UV-LED with blue, green and red phosphors or blue, green and red LEDs [2,3]. Luminescence materials doped with Dy3+ have recently drawn considerable interest because it emits white light. Given that Dy3+ with 4f9 configuration has complicated f-block energy levels, various possible transitions between these levels are highly selective and show sharp line spectra [4,5].In general, Dy3+ exhibits three visible emission bands including the blue emission (460–480nm) corresponding to the 4F9/2→6H15/2 transition, the yellow emission (550–580nm) corresponding to the hypersensitive transition 4F9/2→6H13/2 (ΔJ=2) and the feeble red emission (640–680nm) corresponding to the transition 4F9/2→6H11/2[6–9]. Consequently, white light can be obtained by creating the appropriate mixture of blue and yellow emissions. Moreover, phosphors doped with Dy3+ ions based on their line type f–f transitions, can emit narrow emissions in the visible range, resulting in high efficiency and high lumen equivalence. As a result, there has been growing interest in developing Dy3+ doped phosphors with high absorption in the n-UV to blue range [10–12]. As is known to all, alkaline earth silicates have attracted interest in the field of white light emitting phosphors since they are suitable hosts due to their suitable energy, band structure, high physical and chemical stability, easy preparation and low cost [13,14].The luminescence properties include the thermoluminescence (TL) photoluminescence (PL) as well as mechanoluminescence (ML) of the material. TL or more specifically Thermally Stimulated Luminescence (TSL) is stimulated thermally after initial irradiation given to a phosphor by some other means (α-rays, ß-rays, γ-rays, UV-rays and X-rays). TSL is the phenomenon of emission of light from a solid which has been previously exposed to ionizing radiation under conditions of increasing temperature. In another words TL is one of the possible ways to investigate the trap states of the materials. When light of sufficient energy is incident on a material, photons are absorbed and electronic excitations are created. Eventually, these excitations relax and the electrons return to the ground state. If radiative relaxation occurs, the emitted light is called PL [15]. Luminescence induced during any mechanical action on materials is known as ML. ML can be excited either by grinding, rubbing, cutting, cleaving, shaking, scratching, crushing, compressing, or by impulsive deformation of solids. It can also be excited by thermal shocks caused by drastic cooling or heating of materials or by the shock-waves produced during exposure of samples to laser pulses or ultrasonic waves. ML also appears during the deformation caused by the phase transition or growth of certain crystals as well as during separation of two solids in contact. ML has been observed in insulators, semiconductors as well as in conductors [16].ML has found various important applications such as impact sensors in spacecrafts (the emission intensity can be used to determine the kinetic energy of impact), fracture sensor, damage sensor, stress sensor for the visualizations of stress field near the crack-tip, stress distribution in the solids, and quasidynamic crack-propagation in solids. Thus, many researchers have been focused on the investigation of phosphors with high ML [17]. Until now, some phosphors with high ML, such as red phosphors BaTiO3–CaTiO3:Pr [18], green phosphors SrAl2O4:Eu [19], yellow phosphors ZnS:Mn [20], and blue phosphor CaYAl3O7:Eu [21], have been developed. However, the requirement of application for ML sensors still is not satisfied with the development of ML materials. At the same time, the high stabilities, such as resistance of water, thermal stability, are also very important for the application of ML. More ML phosphors with strong ML intensity and high stability are needed.Mellite are a large group of compounds characterized by the general formula M2T1T22O7, (M=Sr, Ca, Ba; T1=Mn, Co, Cu, Mg, Zn; T2=Si, Ge), have been investigated widely as optical materials. Due to their tetragonal and non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, lanthanides or transition metals can be accepted easily as constituents or dopants by the melilites, allowing the synthesis of high-quality doped single crystals [22]. Recently SrCaMgSi2O7 phosphor has attracted great interest due to its special structure features, excellent physical and chemical stability. They have been studied widely with Eu2+ doping, which shows that a bluish-green emission and long persistent luminescence by co-doping with some other rare earth ions. Solid state reaction technique is a traditional phosphors synthesis techniques is widely used to prepare silicate phosphors because samples prepared using this method have good luminescence and very good morphology, which has advantage over the other techniques [23].In the present paper, we report the structural characterization and luminescence properties in dysprosium doped strontium calcium magnesium di-silicate (SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor. The SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. Investigation of the crystal structure, surface morphology and elemental analysis of sintered phosphor were determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were applied to investigate the different starching modes of prepared phosphor. Optical properties were also investigated on the basis of thermoluminescence (TL), photoluminescence (PL), long afterglow (decay) and mechanoluminescence (ML) properties.The powder sample of dysprosium doped strontium calcium magnesium di-silicate namely SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. The raw materials are strontium carbonate [SrCO3 (99.90%)], calcium carbonate [CaCO3 (99.90%)], magnesium oxide [MgO (99.90%)], silicon di-oxide [SiO2 (99.99%)] and dysprosium oxide [Dy2O3 (99.99%)], all of analytical purity, were employed in this experiment. Boric acid (H3BO3) was added as flux. Initially, the raw materials were weighed according to the nominal compositions of SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Then the powders were mixed and milled thoroughly for 2h using the mortar and pestle. The ground sample were placed in an alumina crucible and subsequently fired at 1250°C for 3h in an air. In order to investigate the crystal structure of the SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor, we also prepare Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ and Ca2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphors at same temperature. At last the nominal compounds were obtained after the cooling down of programmable furnace.The crystal structure of the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Powder XRD pattern has been obtained from Bruker D8 advanced X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and the data were collected over the 2θ range 10—80°. The crystal structure of the sample was verified with the help of Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard Data (JCPDS) file. The surface morphology of the prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was determined by the FESEM. The samples were coated with a thin layer of gold (Au) and then the surface morphology of prepared phosphor were observed by FESEM utilizing ZIESS Ulta Plus-55 operated at the acceleration voltage of 5kV. An EDX spectrum was used for the elemental (qualitative and quantitative) analysis of the prepared phosphor. FTIR spectra were recorded with the help of IR Prestige-21 by SHIMADZU for investigating the finger print region (1400–400cm−1) and functional groups (4000–1400cm−1) of prepared phosphor. The FTIR spectra were collected in the middle infrared region (4000–400cm−1) by mixing the potassium bromide (KBr, A.R. grade) with prepared SrCaMgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The TL glow curves were recorded with the help of TLD reader 1009I by Nucleonix (Hyderabad, India Pvt. Ltd.). In the TL study, the mass of the sample was fixed (8mg), and every time takes the fresh sample for observation. The excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu (RF 5301-PC) spectrofluorophotometer. This spectrofluorophotometer provides corrected excitation and emission spectra in 200–400nm and 400–750nm ranges, respectively. Commission international de I’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates were calculated in terms of the emission spectra. The long afterglow (decay) curves were obtained using a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrometer with the proper excitation under a UV lamp (365nm). The ML measurement was observed by the home made lab system comprising of an RCA-931A photomultiplier tube (PMT). The ML glow curve can be plotted with the help of SM-340 application software installed in a computer attached with the storage oscilloscope. All measurements were carried out at the room temperature.
