Accumulation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the vessel wall is suggested as the initiator of atherosclerosis and coronary stenosis. This process is associated with the performance of endothelium layer that regulates entering of macromolecules to the vessel wall. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules in a coronary tree and predict atherosclerosis prone sites. Non-Newtonian blood flow is simulated for normal and hypertensive conditions through the lumen of a right coronary artery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) images. A three-pore model is implemented as the endothelium boundary condition and hence, plasma flow and LDL transport are simulated within the arterial wall. Based on the pore model, endothelium pathways divide into normal junctions, vesicles and leaky junctions. Most of LDL molecules pass through the leaky junctions that arise at locations with low wall shear stress (WSS). Results indicate that increase in the number of leaky junctions at branch points with lowWSScan lead to both elevated levels of sub-endothelial LDL accumulation and atherosclerosis risk. Findings reveal that at the branch points with disturbed flow, sub-endothelial concentration of LDL for the hypertensive condition is higher than the normal condition, however for the rest of regions with uniform geometry and unidirectional flow, this is reversed. Comparisons of non-Newtonian and Newtonian flows show mean increases of 34% and 13% in the sub-endothelial concentrations of Newtonian flows during the normal and hypertensive conditions, respectively.LDL concentration[molm−3]LDL Diffusion coefficient[m2s−1]Deformation tensorNon-Newtonian importance factorLDL mass flux[molm−2s−1]Plasma volume flux[ms−1]LDL lag coefficientDarcian permeability[m2]Length of leaky junctions[m]Hydraulic conductivity[ms−1Pa−1]Hydraulic pressure[Pa]Diffusive permeability[ms−1]Radius of endothelial cells[m]Radius of LDL molecules[m]LDL degradation rate[s−1]Shape index of endothelial cellsThickness of arterial wall[m]Velocity vector[ms−1]Half width of leaky junctions[m]Wall shear stress[Pa]Shear rate[s−1]Blood viscosity[Pas]Plasma viscosity[Pas]Blood density[kgm−3]Solvent reflection coefficientStress tensor[Pa]Number of leaky cellsNumber of mitotic cellsEndothelium layerArterial lumenLeaky junctionsNormal junctionsSingle leaky junctionVesicle poresArterial wall

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Atherosclerosis is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular diseases around the world. Atherosclerosis refers to the stenosis of arteries and decrease of blood supply to tissues because of plaques formation in the vessel wall. Development of atherosclerosis is associated with the performance of endothelium layer and accumulation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the arterial wall [12,26,34]. Endothelium is a continuous layer of cells that responds to blood flow shear forces, acts as a semipermeable membrane and controls penetration of macromolecules to the vessel wall [10,11]. Disturbed flows which are characterized by non-uniform and irregular flow patterns including recirculation zones [4,6], disrupt the performance of the endothelium and cause leaky junctions at this layer. These junctions exceedingly promote mass flux of LDL macromolecules into the vessel wall that leads to the formation of plaques and development of atherosclerosis [4,6,44].In addition, incidence of atherosclerosis plaques in the coronary arteries reduces blood supply to the heart muscles that may cause severe problems to this vital organ. Several mathematical models have been published for prediction of arterial regions potential to atherosclerosis. Some models have exclusively investigated the blood flow in the coronary arteries and analyzed velocity stream lines, wall shear stress (WSS) and its spatial and temporal gradients to identify the atherosclerosis prone sites [14,16,22,23,32,38,45,48]. To enhance the accuracy of such models, the periodic and non-Newtonian properties of blood flow [14,16,48], time variable geometry of coronary arteries [22,45] and appropriate boundary conditions are taken into account [22,38]. Knight et al. [23] and Rikhtegar et al. [32] conducted simulations of blood flow through the coronary arteries of various patients and analyzed performance of different hemodynamic variables in identifying atherosclerosis plaques. They reconstructed the healthy state right and left coronary arteries of the patients and obtained time average wall shear stress (AWSS) and wall shear stress gradient (AWSSG), oscillatory shear index (OSI) and relative residence time (RRT) through the computational study of periodic blood flow. Then, using statistical analysis, these variables were evaluated as the indicators of atherosclerosis prone sites. According to the statistical studies, even thoughAWSScorrectly predicted the largest number of plaques, it produced more false positives than the other variables. Therefore, they demonstrated that although lowWSSis necessary to initiate atherosclerosis process, it is not sufficient for the plaque formation. Other important factors such as endothelium permeability, LDL mass flux and inflammatory processes are also involved in the coronary stenosis that should be taken into account in the prediction of potential sites of atherosclerosis plaques.There are other studies that simulated LDL transport in addition to the blood flow to predict arterial regions potential to atherosclerosis development. LDL transport models are categorized into three types of wall-free models, lumen-wall models and multi-layer models. In the wall-free models, fluid dynamics and LDL transport are studied only in the lumen side of artery which do not provide any information on the transmural flow and solute dynamics in the arterial wall. Kaazempur-Mofrad and Ethier [18] used a wall-free model to analyze mass transfer patterns in realistic geometries of right coronary arteries and Soulis et al. [40] studied effects ofWSSon LDL accumulation on the luminal of surface of patient specific right coronary arteries. Homogenous-wall models that in addition to the arterial lumen, consider the wall structure. These models approximate multi-structure of the arterial wall as a mono-layer with homogeneous transport properties. Olgac et al. [31] used experimental results of other investigators and related endothelium fluxes toWSS. In this research, material pathways through the endothelium were divided into three classes: normal junctions, vesicles and leaky junctions. They used this model for the analysis of LDL transport in an idealized and also patient-specific geometries of left coronary artery with a single layer homogenous wall [30,31]. Their results showed that locations with the lowest values ofWSShad maximum fluxes through the endothelium layer were coinciding with the locations of LDL accumulation within the wall. The most complex models are multi-layer models that simulate fluid dynamics and material transport through each layer of the arterial wall with distinct properties. Chung and Vafai [9] studied effects of atherosclerotic wall thickening on LDL transport in a multi-layer arterial wall. Kenjeres et al. [21] analyzed LDL transport through a four-layer wall model of an anatomically realistic carotid artery bifurcation.The present study examines LDL transfer through single-layer wall of an image-based geometry of a human right coronary tree and investigates effects of hypertension and non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on the sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules. Three dimensional geometry of the coronary tree was obtained using patient׳s computed tomography images. Employing generalized power law model (as an appropriate non-Newtonian model for blood flow [17]) and time averages of velocity and pressure waveforms reported by Kim et al. [22] (as boundary conditions for the normal and hypertensive conditions), steady state non-Newtonian flow of blood is simulated andWSSdistribution is obtained. Then, with a three-pore model and application of filtration flow and LDL transport equations within the wall, locations of sub-endothelial LDL accumulation are identified and reported as prone sites of atherosclerosis and coronary stenosis.The present study is unique in that it investigates effect of non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on accumulation of LDL molecules within the arterial wall of the right coronaries. Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] previously simulated sub-endothelial accumulation of LDL molecules in the right coronary arteries. However, they neglected effect of non-Newtonian behavior of blood flow on the LDL transport. Nonetheless, in the current study, due to low shear stresses in the right coronary artery, non-Newtonian behavior is included by the generalized power law model. One of the major differences with the simulations of Sun et al. [41] and Sakellarios et al. [36] is at shear dependent boundary conditions and contribution of leaky junctions in the plasma flow and LDL transport through the endothelium layer. They did not considered proportion of leaky junctions in the materials transport into the wall. Whereas, in this study, based on observations of Cancel et al. [2] and due to the importance of leaky junctions in the LDL transport, these pathways are included in the modeling of the endothelium layer.
