@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new similarity measure and a weighted similarity measure on intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSSs) are proposed and some of their basic properties are discussed. Using the proposed similarity measure, a relation (≈α) between two IFSSs are defined and it is found that the defined relation is not an equivalence relation. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure is demonstrated in a numerical example with the help of measure of performance and measure of error. Moreover, medical diagnosis problems have been exhibited through a hypothetical case study by using this proposed similarity measure. Finally, the proposed method is applied to 10 different medical data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and its similarity measures are calculated. The corresponding performance measures, like, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC values, and F-measures are obtained and it is compared with the existing methods. This shows that the proposed method exhibits more accuracy, sensitivity and enhanced F-measures than the existing methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The concept of similarity measure is vitally important in almost every field of science and engineering. A similarity measure is commonly forged for the purpose of feigning the authenticity of the object or document. It is a significant tool for determining the degree of similarity between two objects. Similarity measures are developed using the notions of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and vague sets are widely applied in the field of pattern recognition, image processing, signal detection, security verification systems, medical diagnosis, machine learning, etc.The notion of fuzzy set was introduced by Zadeh [34] in 1965. Many researchers like, Xu et al. [33], Roy et al. [23], Majumdar and Samanta [21], Tripathy et al. [25–31], are attracted by the concept of fuzzy sets and they have developed new notions of fuzzy sets and applied them in many fields of science and technology, economics, medical sciences, etc.In recent years, many researchers [9,10,13,32,33] have introduced different similarity measures between fuzzy sets, vague sets, soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets. Atanassov [1] initiated intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) as a generalization of fuzzy sets introduced by Zadeh [34]. Atanassov [2], Szmidt and Kacprzyk [24] proposed several techniques to measuring the degree of similarity between IFSs, based on the well-known Hamming distance, Euclidean distance and their normalized counterparts. Hung and Yang [9] proposed various methods to estimate the degree of similarity between IFSs, based on the extension of the Hausdorff distance and Lpmetric. Li et al. [14] summarized the various similarity measures, based on IFSs, developed by Chen, Hong and Kim, Fan and Zhangyan, Yanhong et al., Dengfeng and Chuntian, Mitchell, Zhizhen and Pengfei and further he compared the measures with their proposed similarity measure. Liang and Shi [15] quoted some drawbacks of similarity measure on IFSs and proposed an appropriate similarity measure between IFSs which can be applied to pattern recognition problems. Chen [4,5] proposed various methods for measuring the degree of similarity between vague sets and between elements in vague sets. Hong and Kim [8] demonstrated by examples that the similarity measures proposed by Chen [4] does not fit well in some cases, and suggest a set of modified measures. Recently, Li and Cheng [12] proposed a number of new similarity measures between IFSs, and illustrated the application of the said measures in the field of pattern recognition problems.In 1999, Molodtsov [22] introduced a soft set which flexibly defines the various parameters for describing and analyzing a problem which contains the uncertainty. Maji et al. [17,18,23] developed many notions of soft sets and fuzzy soft sets and applied those concepts in many decision making problems. Maji et al. [16,19] has also developed the concept of IFSSs using IFSs introduced by Atanassov [1]. Based on the work of Maji et al., Dinda and Samanta [7] introduced the concept of IFSSs relation and studied some of its algebraic properties. Majumdar and Samanta [20] introduced different kinds of similarity measure on soft sets which are analogous to the similarity measure introduced by Chen [6]. Majumdar et al. [21] established similarity measure of two generalised fuzzy soft sets and applied in medical diagonsis problem. Athar kharal [3] introduced some set operations based distances of soft sets and distance based similarity measures and they have applied the distance similarity measure of soft set in financial diagnosis problem. Jun Ye [11] initiated a cosine similarity measure and a weighted cosine similarity measure between IFSs based on the concept of cosine similarity measure for fuzzy set.The concept of IFSS depends not only on the membership function, but also on the non-membership function of the relevant parameters. The most of the decision making problems through similarity measures depends only on membership values of the parameter. Here, by considering non-membership values of the parameter, a more accurate similarity measure can be obtained. This motivates an extensive study of similarity measure through IFSS in multi-criteria decision making problems. For example, if the glucose level of the person is 100mg/dL, then by assigning the membership and non-membership values, using the notion of IFSS, it is easy to categorize the person is diabetic or non-diabetic or likely to be diabetic, which can be represented as high, low, and medium, respectively. Therefore, the proposed technique facilitates to alarm the patient about his susceptibility of becoming diabetic. This paper claims that some medical diagnosis problem can be modeled through IFSSs, and the use of similarity measures between IFSSs has given better results in diagnosis problems in the medical field.In this paper, the similarity measures between two IFSSs are investigated. A new similarity measure and a weighted similarity measure on IFSSs are proposed and some of their basic properties are discussed. Using this proposed similarity measure, a relation (≈α) between two IFSSs are defined and it is found that the defined relation is not an equivalence relation. Further, the optimality criteria for the decision making problem using the proposed method are stated and performance analysis of the method is discussed through a measure of performance and measure of error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a numerical example based on performance analysis.Finally, the proposed method is applied on ten different medical data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets [35] to the diagnostic problem and their interested parameters are presented. To mention a few, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, marginal adhesion), Heart Diseases (maximum heart rate achieved, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol), Pima Indians Diabetes Database (diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, body mass index), Echo-cardiogram dataset (age at heart attack, fractional shortening, left ventricular end diastolic dimension), EEGeye dataset (AF3, F7, FC5), Hepatitis domain (alk phosphate, bilirubin, albumin), chronic kidney disease dataset (specific gravity, blood urea, sodium), BUPA liver disorders (man corpuscular volume, alkaline phosphotase, sgpt), Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset (diameter of the optic disc, Euclidean distance of the center of the macula and the center of the optic disc, MA detection), and Thoracic Surgery dataset (forced vital capacity, age at surgery, FEV1). The data corresponding to the interested parameters in each problem are numeric values. These values are converted into a fuzzy soft set by assigning membership functions. The obtained fuzzy soft set can be transformed into IFSSs to construct the IFSS matrix by considering non-membership functions. A model IFSS (M,E) is constructed based on the information about interested parameters obtained from the domain experts. A similarity measure between the constructed IFSS matrix and the model (M,E) is calculated and decision can be made by fixing the threshold value. The corresponding performance measures like, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC values and F-measure are obtained from the proposed method. In this method, similarity measure lies between 0 and 1 which eliminates the negative similarity rating in the existing methods. The diagrammatic representation of the proposed method is given in Fig. 1.Definition 1[22] Let U be an initial universe set and let E be a set of parameters. A pair (F, E) is called a soft set (over U) if and only if F is a mapping of E into the set of all subsets of the set U.[18] Let U be an initial universe set and E be a set of parameters. Let F(U) denotes the fuzzy power set of U. Let A⊂E. A pair (F, A) is called a fuzzy soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F:A→F(U).[1] An intuitionistic fuzzy set A over the universe U can be defined as follows:A=(x,μA(x),νA(x)):x∈U, where μA(x):U→[0, 1], νA(x):U→[0, 1] with the property 0≤μA(x)+νA(x)≤1, ∀x∈U. The values μA(x) and νA(x) represent the degree of membership and non-membership of x to A, respectively. πA(x)=1−(μA(x)+νA(x)) is called the intuitionistic fuzzy index.[19] Let U be an initial universe set and E be the set of parameters. Let IFUdenote the collection of all intuitionistic fuzzy subsets of U. Let A⊂E. A pair (F, A) is called intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSSs)over U, where F is a mapping given by F:A→IFU.[19] Intersection of two IFSSs (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U is the IFSS (H, C), where C=A∩B, and, H(e)=F(e)∩G(e) for all e∈C. We write(F,A)∩˜(G,B)=(H,C).[19] Union of two IFSSs (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U is the IFSS (H, C), where C=A∪B, and,H(e)=F(e),ife∈A−B=G(e),ife∈B−A=F(e)∪G(e),ife∈A∪B.We write(F,A)∪˜(G,B)=(H,C).[19] For two IFSSs (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U, we say that (F, A) is an intuitionistic fuzzy soft subset of (G, B) if(i)A⊂B, andfor all e∈A, F(e) is an intuitionistic fuzzy subset of G(e).[19] Two IFSSs (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U are said to be equal if (F, A) is an intuitionistic fuzzy soft sub set of (G, B) and (G, B) is an intuitionistic fuzzy soft sub set of (F, A).[20] If E1=E2, then similarity between (F1, E1) and (F2, E2) is defined by,S(F1,F2)=∑iF1→(ei)·F2→(ei)∑iF1→(ei)2∨F2→(ei)2If E1≠E2, and E=E1∩E2≠ϕ, then we first defineF1→(e)=0_for e∈E2∖E andF2→(f)=0_for f∈E1∖E. Then S(F1, F2) is defined by the above formula.[20] Let U={u1, u2, …, un} be the universe andwibe the weight of uiandwi∈[0,1], but not all zero, 1≤i≤n. Let (F, E) and (G, E) be two soft sets over U. Then their weighted similarity is defined as follows:W(F,G)=∑iwi(F→(ei)·G→(ei))∑i[F→(ei)2∨G→(ei)2]/∑iWiIn this section, definitions and examples of IFSS matrices and its similarities are studied. Further, some of its properties are investigated.Definition 11Let U={u1, u2, …, um} be the universal set and E be the set of parameters given by E={e1, e2, …, en}. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSSs)(F, E)can be expressed in matrix form asFμ,ν=[aij]m×nor simply by [aij], i=1, 2, 3, …, m;j=1, 2, 3, …, n and aij=(μF(xi, ej), νF(xi, ej)), where μF(xi, ej) and νF(xi, ej) represent the membership and non-membership values of xiand ej, respectively. That is,Example 1Let (F, E) describes the character of the students with respect to the given parameters, for finding the best student of an academic year. Let the set of students under consideration is U={s1, s2, s3, s4} and E={r=“academicperformance″, c=“conduct″, g=“co−curricularactivities″}. Let F(r)={(s1, 0.8, 0.1), (s2, 0.9, 0.05), (s3, 0.85, 0.1), (s4, 0.75, 0.2)}, F(c)={(s1, 0.6, 0.3), (s2, 0.65, 0.2), (s3, 0.7, 0.2), (s4, 0.65, 0.2)}, and F(g)={(s1, 0.75, 0.2), (s2, 0.5, 0.3), (s3, 0.5, 0.4), (s4, 0.7, 0.2)}.Then the family F(r), F(c), F(g) of IFUis an IFSS. In matrix form, this IFSS can be expressed as[aij]=(0.8,0.1)(0.6,0.3)(0.75,0.2)(0.9,0.05)(0.65,0.2)(0.5,0.3)(0.85,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.5,0.4)(0.75,0.2)(0.65,0.2)(0.7,0.2)where the ith column vector represents membership and non-membership values of ei. It is clear that for any given IFSS matrix Fμ,ν, we can retrieve the IFSS (F, E) in an obvious way. Henceforth, we will denote each column of the IFSS matrix by the vector Fμ,ν(ei). We write Fμ,ν(ei)=(Fμ(ei), Fν(ei)).In the above Example 1, Fμ,ν(e1)=(Fμ(e1), Fν(e1)), where Fμ(e1)=(0.8, 0.9, 0.85, 0.75) and Fν(e1)=(0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2).Let (F, E1) and (G, E2) be two IFSSs with the membership functions μFand μG, also non-membership functions νFand νG, respectively. If E1=E2, then the similarity between (F, E1) and (G, E2) is denoted by SIFSSs(F, G) and is defined by(3.1)SIFSSs(F,G)=∑i[{Fμ→(ei)·Gμ→(ei)}+{Fν→(ei)·Gν→(ei)}]∑i[{Fμ→(ei)2∨Gμ→(ei)2}+{Fν→(ei)2∨Gν→(ei)2}]If E1≠E2, and E=E1∩E2≠ϕ, then we first defineFμ,ν→(e)=0_for e∈E2∖E andFμ,ν→(f)=0_for f∈E1∖E. Then SIFSSs(F, G) is defined by the above formula (3.1).We observe that if E1∩E2=ϕ then SIFSSs(F, G)=0Let U={c1, c2, c3, c4} be the universal set and E be the set of parameters given by E={e1, e2, e3}. We consider the two IFSSs,(F,E)=F(e1)={(c1,0.3,0.0),(c2,0.5,0.1),(c3,0.6,0.3),(c4,0.5,0.0)}F(e2)={(c1,0.7,0.1),(c2,0.9,0.0),(c3,0.7,0.1),(c4,0.8,0.2)}F(e3)={c1,0.6,0.2),(c2,0.7,0.0),(c3,0.7,0.2),(c4,0.3,0.0)}(G,E)=G(e1)={(c1,0.8,0.1),(c2,0.7,0.2),(c3,0.5,0.2),(c4,0.4,0.1)}G(e2)={(c1,0.9,0.0),(c2,0.9,0.0),(c3,0.8,0.0),(c4,0.7,0.0)}G(e3)={(c1,0.5,0.3),(c2,0.9,0.1),(c3,0.6,0.1),(c4,0.8,0.1)}The intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices representing these two IFSSs are respectively,Fμ,ν=(0.3,0.0)(0.7,0.1)(0.6,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.9,0.0)(0.7,0.0)(0.6,0.3)(0.7,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.5,0.0)(0.8,0.2)(0.3,0.0)andGμ,ν=(0.8,0.1)(0.9,0.0)(0.5,0.3)(0.7,0.2)(0.9,0.0)(0.9,0.1)(0.5,0.2)(0.8,0.0)(0.6,0.1)(0.4,0.1)(0.7,0.0)(0.8,0.1)ThenSIFSSs(F,G)=∑i=13[{Fμ→(ei)·Gμ→(ei)}+{Fν→(ei)·Gν→(ei)}]∑i=13[{Fμ→(ei)2∨Gμ→(ei)2}+{Fν→(ei)2∨Gν→(ei)2}]=0.81448≈0.81.Let (F, E) and (G, E) be two IFSSs over the same finite universe U. Then the following conditions are hold:(i)SIFSSs(F, G)=SIFSSs(G, F)0≤SIFSSs(F, G)≤1SIFSSs(F, G)=1 if and only if F=GSIFSSs(F, Fc)=0 if F is a crisp set.ProofProof of conditions (i) and (ii) are trivally followed from the Definition 12.To prove (iii), claim SIFSSs(F, G)=1 when F=G.By the definition of SIFSSs(F, G),[{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}+{Fν→(e)·Gν→(e)}][{Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}+{Fν→(e)2∨Gν→(e)2}]=1,⇒[{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}+{Fν→(e)·Gν→(e)}]=[{Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}+{Fν→(e)2∨Gν→(e)2}]Now we claim that{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}={Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}and{Fν→(e)·Gν→(e)}={Fν→(e)2∨Gν→(e)2}]Suppose{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}≠{Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}, since{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}≤{Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}, there exist r>0 such that{Fμ→(e)·Gμ→(e)}+r={Fμ→(e)2∨Gμ→(e)2}.Similarly, there exist s>0 such that{Fν→(e)·Gν→(e)}+s={Fν→(e)2∨Gν→(e)2}].By hypothesis it follows that r + s = 0. This implies that r = -s, which is not possible.This implies that Fμ,ν=(μF(x, e), νF(x, e))=(μG(x, e), νG(x, e))=Gμ,νand hence SIFSSs(F, G)=1.Converse, trivially follows from the Definition 12.In order to prove (iv), we assume that F is a crisp set, that is, F={x, (1, 0)}(orF={x, (0, 1)}). In this regard the complement set F is defined as Fc={x, (0, 1)}(orFc={x, (1, 0)}). Hence SIFSSs(F, Fc)=0. □Lemma 2Let (F, E), (G, E), (H, E) be three IFSSs such that (F, E) is an intuitionistic fuzzy soft subset of (G, E) and (G, E) is an intuitionistic fuzzy soft subset of (H, E), then SIFSSs(F, H)≤SIFSSs(G, H).ProofThe proof is straightforward. □Definition 13Two IFSSs (F, E1) and (G, E2) are said to be ≈α-similar, denoted as (F, E1)≈α(G, E2), if and only if SIFSSs(F, G)≥α for α∈(0, 1).≈αis reflexive and symmetric.The reflexive and symmetry part follows from Lemma 1. □The following example shows that ≈αis not transitive.Example 3Let U={c1, c2, c3} be the universal set and E be the set of parameters given by E={e1, e2, e3}. Let us define α=0.5. We consider the three IFSSs (F, E), (G, E) and (H, E), whose IFSS matrices as follows:(F,E)=(0.7,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.6,0.1)(0.5,0.3)(0.7,0.1)(0.6,0.0)(0.8,0.2)(0.6,0.0)(0.9,0.0)(G,E)=(0.4,0.3)(0.7,0.0)(0.6,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.0)(0.5,0.1)(0.7,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.8,0.0)(H,E)=(0.6,0.4)(0.5,0.0)(0.5,0.1)(0.3,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.4,0.4)(0.2,0.0)(0.5,0.0)(0.1,0.8)Then SIFSSs(F, G)=0.80>0.5, SIFSSs(G, H)=0.5, but SIFSSs(F, H)=0.48<0.5. Hence ≈αis not transitive.Let (F, E1) and (G, E2) be two IFSSs over the same universe U. Then two IFSSs are said to be significantly similar if SIFSSs(F, G)≥0.5.In this section, define weighted similarity measure between two IFSSs and also some of its properties are studied.Definition 15Let E={e1, e2, …, en} be the set of parameters andwibe the weight of eiandwi∈[0,1], but not all zero, 1≤i≤n. Let (F, E) and (G, E) be two IFSSs over U. Then their weighted similarity is defined as follows:WIFSSs(F,G)=∑i=1nwi[{Fμ→(ei)·Gμ→(ei)}+{Fν→(ei)·Gν→(ei)}]∑i=1n[{Fμ→(ei)2∨Gμ→(ei)2}+{Fν→(ei)2∨Gν→(ei)2}]/∑i=1nwiIn Example 2, consider 0.5,0.6,and 0.8 be the weights of e1, e2, e3, respectively. ThenWIFSSs(F,G)=0.585+1.536+1.3361.64+2.81+2.18/1.9=0.2744≈0.27.Let (F, E) and (G, E) be two IFSSs over the same finite universe U. Then the following conditions are hold:(iv)(i)WIFSSs(F, G)=WIFSSs(G, F)0≤WIFSSs(F, G)≤1WIFSSs(F, G)=1 if and only if F=GWIFSSs(F, Fc)=0 if F is a crisp set.ProofTrivially follows from the Definition 15 and Lemma 1. □Optimality criteria with respect to similarity measure of IFSSs for a decision making problem is defined.(i)The choice value of at least one pair should be maximum. In other words, the sum of the membership values and the sum of the non-membership values of at least one pair should be maximum.There is not a huge difference between the membership and non-membership from one pair to another. It should be close to each other.The measure of performance of a method (say, M) which satisfies the optimality criteria to solve an IFSS based decision making problem is defined as,PM=S(Ort)+1∑i=1,(r,t)≠(i,j)n−1∑j=i+1n(1−S(Oij));S(Ort)>S(Oij)This formula represents the sum of the highest similarity value of an object and an inverse of the summation of the non-similarity values of the remaining objects.The measure of error of a method (say, M) which also satisfies the optimality criteria to solve an IFSS based decision making problem is defined as,EM=S(Ort)+1∑i=1,(r,t)≠(i,j)n−1∑j=i+1n(S(Ort)−S(Oij));S(Ort)>S(Oij)This formula represents the sum of the highest similarity value of an object and an inverse of the summation of the difference of highest similarity value and the similarity values of the remaining objects.Here, to illustrate and compare our proposed similarity measure SIFSSswith the existing similarity measures, we recall all the methods analyzed by Li et al in [14]. Consider two IFSSs AIFSS, BIFSS∈IFSS(X), where X={x1, x2, …, xn}. The similarity measures analyzed by Li et al. in [14] are briefly described as follows:(6.1)SC(A,B)=1−∑i=1nSA(xi)−SB(xi)2n;where SA(xi)=μA(xi)−νA(xi) and SB(xi)=μB(xi)−νB(xi)(6.2)SH(A,B)=1−∑i=1n(μA(xi)−μB(xi)+νA(xi)−νB(xi))2n;(6.3)SL(A,B)=1−∑i=1nSA(xi)−SB(xi)4n−∑i=1n(μA(xi)−μB(xi)+νA(xi)−νB(xi))4n;(6.4)SO(A,B)=1−∑i=1n(μA(xi)−μB(xi))2+(νA(xi)−νB(xi))22n;(6.5)SDC(A,B)=1−∑i=1nψA(xi)−ψB(xi)pnp;whereψA(xi)=μA(xi)+1−νA(xi)2andψB(xi)=μB(xi)+1−νB(xi)2(6.6)SHB(A,B)=ρμ(A,B)+ρν(A,B)2;whereρμ(A,B)=SDC(μA(xi),μB(xi))=1−∑i=1nμA(xi)−μB(xi)pnp,ρν(A,B)=SDC(1−νA(xi),1−νB(xi))=1−∑i=1nνA(xi)−νB(xi)pnpand SHB(A, B)=SH(A, B) for p=1;(6.7)SHY1(A,B)=1−dH(A,B);wheredH(A,B)=∑i=1nmax(μA(xi)−μB(xi),νA(xi)−νB(xi))n(6.8)SHY2(A,B)=e−dH(A,B)−e−11−e−1forthesamedH(A,B);(6.9)SHY3(A,B)=1−dH(A,B)1+dH(A,B)forthesamedH(A,B).To demonstrate the effectiveness of the similarity measure proposed herein, comparisons between the formulas (6.1)–(6.9) and (3.1) are illustrated in an IFSS by setting the following numerical example.Let U={c1, c2, c3} be the universal set and E be the set of parameters given by E={e1, e2, e3}. We consider the three IFSSs (F, E), (G, E) and (H, E), whose IFSS matrices as follows:(F,E)=(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.5)(0.8,0.1)(0.5,0.3)(0.7,0.1)(0.6,0.3)(0.8,0.2)(0.6,0.0)(0.9,0.0)(G,E)=(0.5,0.3)(0.7,0.0)(0.6,0.3)(0.6,0.2)(0.4,0.0)(0.5,0.1)(0.9,0.0)(0.5,0.1)(0.8,0.0)(H,E)=(0.4,0.4)(0.6,0.2)(0.5,0.1)(0.3,0.2)(0.7,0.1)(0.5,0.4)(0.2,0.0)(0.5,0.0)(0.1,0.8)The following Table 1shows the comparative results for the existing measures (6.1)–(6.9) and the proposed measure (3.1) with the above numerical example.From Table 1 and Fig. 2, it is observed that our proposed method shows better similarity rating from other existing similarity measures.The following Table 2and Fig. 3, shows the measure of performance of the existing and the proposed similarity measure for the above example.From the Fig. 3 as well as from Table 2, it can be easily found that the proposed similarity measure has the high degree of accuracy while comparing with the existing measures.The following Table 3and Fig. 4, shows the measure of error of the existing and the proposed similarity measure to the above example.From the above Fig. 4 as well as from Table 3, it can be easily understood the proposed similarity measure has a least error while comparing with the existing measures. Hence, from 6.2.1–6.2.3, it is found that the proposed similarity measure based on IFSSs, shows better performance in-terms of high similarity rating with minimum error than the existing similarity measures.In this section, we present a medical diagnosis problem where similarity measures can be applied. In the following example, demonstrate this new proposed technique of similarity measure between two IFSSs can be applied to detect whether a patient is suffering from a certain disease or not.Dengue has emerged as a global problem only since the Second World War and is endemic in several countries. As many as 400 million people are infected yearly. It has an incapacitating viral disease of the tropics, spread by mosquitoes, and not spread directly from person-to-person. The symptoms range from mild fever, to incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain. There is no vaccine or any precise medicine to treat dengue. Early recognition and prompt supportive treatment can substantially lower the risk of medical complications and death. Now, we try to estimate the more possibility that a patient having certain visible symptoms is suffering from dengue fever.For this, we first construct a model IFSS for dengue fever and the IFSSs of symptoms for the patients. Next, we find the similarity measures for these IFSSs with that of the model IFSS. Subsequently, we define a threshold value ′α′ and comparing this alpha with the value of similarity measure. If the value of similarity measure is greater than the threshold value, then we conclude that the person is possibly suffering from dengue fever and otherwise not.Suppose there are fifteen patients P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15 in a hospital with symptoms sudden fever, headache, and knee pains. Consider X={suddenfever(a), headache(b), kneepains(c)} is the collection of medical indicators which are noticed from the patients. Further, let E={no(e1), mild(e2), severe(e3)} be the set of parameters, which are basically linguistic labels commonly used to describe the state of medical indicators.Let (M, E) be a model IFSS for dengue fever which can be prepared with the help of a physician. The profile of patients by observing its medical indicators may easily be coded into an IFSS by using appropriate linguistic labels. Let (F, E), (G, E), (H, E), (I, E), (J, E), (K, E), (L, E), (N, E), (O, E), (P, E), (Q, E), (R, E), (S, E), (T, E), and (U, E) be IFSSs profiles of the patients P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15, respectively.In the following Table 4, we compare the symptoms of the patients with that of the model in order to get the similarity measure between these IFSSs.Let us define the threshold value α=0.6, and comparing this with the value of similarity measure in Table 4. Now the Model IFSS (M, E) is significantly similar to (F, E), (L, E), (N, E), (P, E), (Q, E) and the other IFSSs are not significantly similar to it. Hence we conclude that the patients P1, P7, P8, P10, P11 are suffering from dengue fever and the other patients may not have dengue fewer. Out of these five affected patients, we identify a patient P10 is most affected person.Next we define a weighted similarity measure between the same data set, the result is also the same as the one obtained in above. Consider 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 be the weights of e1, e2 and e3, respectively. We define a threshold value ′α′, by α=(0.5+0.6+0.8)/9=0.2111. Then the weighted similarity measures are given in the Table 5.From this table, we conclude that the weighted similarity measures in the model IFSS (M, E) and (F, E),(L, E),(N, E),(P, E),(Q, E) are significantly similar and the other IFSSs are not significantly similar to the model (M, E). So we conclude that patients P1, P7, P8, P10, P11 are suffering from dengue fever and the other patients are not suffering from dengue fever.This is only a simple model to show the possibility of using this method for diagnosis of disease which could be improved by incorporating clinical results and other competing diagnosis.The effectivenesses of the proposed method can be established by considering ten different medical datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and their corresponding performance measures are investigated.Ten different medical data sets from the heterogeneous data base collection are selected to evaluate the performance of the new proposed method, namely, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (D1), Heart Diseases (D2), Pima Indians Diabetes Database (D3), echo-cardiogram dataset (D4), EEG eye dataset (D5), hepatitis domain (D6), chronic kidney disease dataset (D7), BUPA liver disorders (D8), Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset (D9), and Thoracic Surgery dataset (D10). By eliminating the missing data and using random selection process, fixed number of relevant items (nearly 50 patients data) from each dataset are considered for the analysis.The considered data sets are transformed into the intuitionistic fuzzy soft datasets by using Mat lab fuzzy logic toolbox software. The similarity measures are computed for the transformed fuzzy data using the proposed method and the results are compared with the similarity measures obtained by the existing methods. The sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC values, and F-measure for each dataset are also computed.
