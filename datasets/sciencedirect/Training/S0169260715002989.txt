Analysis of survival adjusted for quality of life using the Q-TWiST function: Interface in R

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We developed a function written the R software performing Q-TWiST analyses.Three health states are defined: toxicity, relapse and TWiST.Inputs are checked and descriptive, comparative and graphical results are provided.Several arguments take the opportunity to add more options to the analyze.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
ObjectiveThe analysis of treatment effects in clinical trials usually focus on efficacy and safety in separate descriptive statistical analyses. The Q-TWiST (Quality adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity) method has been proposed by Gelber in the 90s to enable a statistical comparison between two groups with a graphical representation by incorporating benefit and risk into a single analysis. Although the method has been programmed in SAS, it is rarely used. The availability of the method in the freely software environment system like R would greatly enhanced the accessibility by researchers. The objective of this paper is to present a program for Q-TWiST analyses within R software environment.MethodsThe qtwist function was developed in order to estimate and compare Q-TWiST for two groups. Two individual patient data files are required used for input: one for visits and one for follow-up. Q-TWiST is obtained as a sum of time spent in three health states: period in toxicity (TOX), period without relapse and toxicity (TWiST) and period in relapse (REL), weighted by associated utility scores restricted to median overall survival for example. The bootstrap method is used for testing statistical significance. Threshold analysis and gain functions allow a group comparison for different utility values.ResultsInput data is checked for consistency. Descriptive statistics and mean durations for each health state are provided, allowing statistical comparisons. Graphical results are presented in a PDF file. The use of the function is illustrated with data from a simulated data set and a randomized clinical trial.Conclusionsqtwist is an easy to use R function, allowing a quality adjusted survival analysis with the Q-TWiST method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
New treatment strategies developed over the last few years in the field of oncology have allowed longer survival durations but often at the cost of severe toxicities and poor quality of life [1,2]. Taking into account not only survival but also treatment related side effects is a fundamental objective for evaluating results over the time. Most evaluation tools use validated questionnaires to summarize information with scores. The types of toxicities and the nature of side effects can be classified by severity categories at a given time point. Most often however, toxicity results are usually summarized by the maximal severity grade for each patient observed over the study period.In the analysis of such longitudinal data, more sophisticated analyses can be performed by estimating changes over time by using mixed models adapted to repeated measures in order to test the time effect. Other methods with fewer hypotheses have been developed which take into account the time factor to estimate prevalence functions over time [3]. These methods have been generalized to take into account long term complications of varying severity among patients alive without relapse [4]. An R function has recently been published for these analyses [5].The Q-TWiST (Quality adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity) methodology has been used for supplementary analyses of clinical trials taking into account toxicities during treatment as well as relapse and survival [6]. Usually, three variables are generated for each patient: period spent in toxicity (TOX), period spent without symptoms of toxicity (TWiST) and period spent in relapse (REL). Some examples have used the Q-TWiST method in the evaluation of rituximab plus CVP vs. CVP alone in first-line treatment of advanced follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [7] or best supportive care with or without panitumumab in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer [8]. Other examples applied to health related quality of life can be found in Osoba [9]. Data analysis for quality adjusted survival data using the Q-TWiST method has been programmed in SAS, but is not available in a free environment like R.The objective of this article is to provide an R function for the analyses of survival adjusted for quality of life for three health states using the Q-TWiST method. The availability of this tool could make easier its appropriation by research teams as part of a joint analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints in the evaluation of treatment strategies.Methods as well as a small example are presented in Section 2. The R function is described in Section 3. In Section 4, results of a phase III randomized trial comparing two pre-operative brachytherapy low dose rates in patients with localized cervix carcinoma are used for illustration [10].
