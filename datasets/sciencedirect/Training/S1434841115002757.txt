@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Inductive coupling of two parallel resonant circuits is still one of the most important structures in the practical bandpass filters. The frequency response of these structures has two passbands; one is desirable and the other one is not. This paper presents a novel scheme to omit the second spurious passband based on theoretical analysis. Thus, a prototype circuit has been designed based on transmission line theory. Simulations show that its behavior agrees well with the ideal equivalent lumped circuit over a very wide range of frequencies. Center frequency tuning has been implemented by using a simple high-Q varactor based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The tuning range of the proposed circuit is 9.8% and the fractional bandwidth is 10.8±0.4 for the 15–16.5GHz frequency range in the Ku-band. The compact size of the filter is 1.15mm×0.7mm and it has a good stop rejection and sharp roll-off frequency compared to its conventional counterpart. It has an insertion loss below 2.5dB and returns loss higher than 10dB in the passband across the whole tuning range.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The increase in the number of band's diversity in wireless systems poses serious challenges in spectrum management. Therefore, proper filtration or spectrum separation is one of the subjects that has attracted the highest level of interest. This is not only due to the system's performance, but also because of strict radio frequency (RF) spectrum policies [1]. Therefore, it heightens the requirements for microwave and millimeter wave filters used in those systems and shows limitations on well-known classic filter theories and design methods [2,3]. In highly integrated systems, it is more desirable to reduce the circuit dimensions and use planar structures such as coplanar waveguides (CPW), apart from the usual requirements such as high selectivity, low insertion loss (IL), wider and deeper stopband, and low cost fabrication [4,5].Bandpass filters (BPFs) are an essential and critical part of communication and radar systems. In microwave technology, the direct coupling of resonators is still considered to be one of the most common bandpass filter structures. An efficient way to design these circuits is Cohn's method that was developed in the 1950s and was repeated in a similar form in many other handbooks [2]. In this method, all resonators with the same resonant frequency are coupled through ideal admittance (impedance) inverters. Most of these filters only have two parallel resonators that are interconnected through a real coupling element such as an inductor or a capacitor [6].Nowadays, in modern wireless systems, new tunable filters with low insertion loss and excellent power handling capabilities have replaced the old mechanical tunable filters due to existing limitations such as their very large size and highly slow tuning speed [7]. The recently developed microelectromechanical systems commonly known as MEMS have enabled the design and development of a new generation of electronic devices, particularly RF switches. These switches could be employed in RF circuits with a better performance than other standard switches such as field-effect transistors (FET) and positive intrinsic negative (PIN) diodes, due to their good specifications such as low IL, small size, good performances over a wide frequency band, and so on [8–11].MEMS-based tunable switches and capacitors with their good specifications could be an excellent candidate for developing compact, reconfigurable, and tunable RF front-end systems, such as mobile phones, radar systems, and wide-band tracking receivers [12,13].Specifically, MEMS-based parallel-plate capacitors are still widely used as a tunable part of many filters, because of their excellent results [14]. Controlling the distance between the parallel plates of MEMS switches is commonly done by an electrostatic actuation force and could be fabricated on the silicon, quartz, glass, or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrates [15].This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the conventional structure is introduced and our novel modification is explained in Section 3. In Section 4, a new tunable bandpass filter design is presented based on the proposed technique and transmission line theory. The final circuit and simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 4.5. Finally, the paper ends with conclusions in Section 5.Bandpass filters are an essential and critical part of radar and communication systems. Direct-coupled resonator filters are one of the most common bandpass filter structures in microwave technology and are based on inductive and capacitive coupling of parallel LC resonators [1]. Fig. 1(a) shows an inductively coupled structure that is composed of three spiral inductors and two parallel-plate capacitors. The scattering parameter S21, of this circuit is shown to be equal to the following equation in Appendix A:(1)S21=2Z0LC02⋅ss2+sZ0C0+1C0L0⋅s2+sZ0C0+1C0L01+2L0L.As seen from this equation, it has only one zero at the DC frequency and four poles at the following frequencies:(2)p1,2=−12Z0C0±12Z0C02−1C0L0p3,4=−12Z0C0±12Z0C02−1C0L01+2L0L.If we assume (2Z0C0)−2≪(C0L0)−1 orL0≪4Z02C0, we have approximately two conjugated poles pair at the following frequencies:(3)p1,2=±j1C0L0p3,4=±j1C0L01+2L0L.Hence, there are two resonance frequencies at:(4)f01=12πC0L0andf02=f011+2L0L.Consequently, the frequency spectrum of this structure consists of two passbands at f01 and f02 frequencies, as the acceptable frequency and the spurious one, respectively.In this paper, Agilent ADS tools have carried out simulation and optimization of the lumped circuits. As shown in Fig. 1(b) for optimized values L0=0.094 nH and C0=1pF, over-coupling (L<L0) causes to a wider stopband between f01 and f02 frequencies, but with a smoother roll-off frequency. Also, as shown in Fig. 1(d), under-coupling (L≫L0) removes the spurious passband, but it first widens the first passband and further increasing the L limits the bandwidth and increases the IL.In the next section, a new technique is proposed to omit of the spurious passband at frequency f02 for the optimized value (L=L0).Fig. 2(a) shows the proposed new bandpass filter that is a modification of the conventional circuit shown in Fig. 1(a). It is based on replacing the T-subcircuit shown in Fig. 3(a), by a Π-subcircuit shown in Fig. 3(b), that has a dissimilar frequency response characteristics except only at frequency f01 as shown in Fig. 4.Therefore, the proposed circuit is similar to the conventional circuit only at frequency f01 and it only passes the signals around this frequency. The results depicted in Fig. 2(b) clearly show that the proposed technique substantially removes the spurious passband at frequency f02. As a result, we have:(5)f0=f01=12πL0C0→ω02L0C0=1.Next, the T-subcircuit elements are calculated as follows. First, the impedance parameters of Π and T-subcircuits are calculated. Then we set them equal to each other under the condition defined in (5). Therefore, the Z parameters of the subcircuit shown in Fig. 3(a) are as follows:(6)Z22=Z11=V1I1I2=0=jωL+1jωC0/(2−ω2LC0)Z12=Z21=V2I1I2=0=1jωC0/(2−ω2LC0)and the Z parameters of the circuit shown in Fig. 3(b) are as follows:(7)Z22=Z11=jωL1+1jωC1Z12=Z21=1jωC1Equating (6) and (7) for ω=ω0=ω01 andω02L0C0=1, gives:(8)C1=C02−LL0,and(9)L1=L2−LL0.The scattering parameter, S21, of the modified circuit has analytically derived in Appendix B. The results yield:(10)S21=2AZ0⋅1A(sL1)22sL1+sC1−2,where A=1/Z0+1/(sL0)+1/(sL1). Substituting the optimized value L=L0 in (8) and (9) results in L1=L0 and C1=C0. So, we have A=1/Z0+2/(sL0) and as has shown in Appendix C, (10) is simplified to:(11)S21=12Z01+sL02Z0⋅sL0sL02Z0(2+s2L0C0)+(1+s2L0C0).This equation is the exact frequency response of the proposed lumped circuit that has been shown in Fig. 2(a) for L1=L0. Multiplying (2+s2L0C0) by a small value of sL0/(2Z0) causes a great passband suppression at the frequency f02. Consequently, the proposed circuit only has one zero at zero frequency and two conjugated imaginary poles at frequencies f01 and very far from it. Also, a negative real pole exists at frequency −2Z0/L0. Consequently, The proposed new scheme significantly removes the spurious passband at frequency f02. Furthermore, one of the most important miniaturization techniques is reducing the number of large area elements such as tunable elements. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the proposed modified circuit has been designed such that it only needs one tunable capacitor, whereas the conventional circuit needs two tunable capacitors, as shown in Fig. 1(a).Therefore, the proposed new design scheme results in more miniaturization of the circuit. According to (5), the single capacitor of the circuit is a good candidate for tuning the central frequency of the circuit.The design of the proposed circuit has done by replacing the lumped elements with their equivalent transmission line-based elements as explained below.Frequency dependency is one of the main problems in substituting transmission line-based elements for frequency independent lumped inductors and capacitors since they have an equal behavior only in a narrow range of frequencies.In this section, a proper transmission line-based frequency independent capacitor and inductor are designed such that they have a very low frequency dependency over a very wide range of frequencies. Then, the final circuit shall be designed by using these elements, in Section 5.In the following, a technique is described for decreasing the frequency dependency of transmission line-based elements. First, consider a transmission line by Z0 as its characteristic impedance. The transmission line is assumed to terminate at load ZL. The circuit input impedance is [16](12)Zin=Z0ZL+jZ0tan(βl)Z0+jZLtan(βl)=Z0ZL+jZ0tan2πλlZ0+jZLtan2πλl(Ω),where λ is equal toλ0/εr=c/(fεr), l denotes the transmission line length, andZ0≅L′/C′(L′ and C′ respectively denotes the line inductance and capacitance per meter). If we select βl=(2π/λ)l≪2π or l<0.01λ, we will have [16](13)Zin=Z0ZL+jZ02πλlZ0+jZL2πλl(Ω).For open and short loads we have:ifZL=0:Zin=jZ02πλl=j2πfZ0cεrl=j2πfLeq(Ω)ifZL→∞:Zin=Z0j2πλl=1j2πfεrlcZ0=1j2πfCeq(Ω)Consequently, for l<0.01λ we have [16]:(14)ifZL=0:Zin=jωLeq,Leq=Z0cεrl(H)ifZL→∞:Zin=1/(jωCeq),Ceq=1cZ0εrl(F)Thus, we can make nearly frequency independent inductors and capacitors by using very short length strips.Because of some difficulties in calculating Z0, due to the small dimensions and the unwanted crosstalk by nearby elements, it is fine to initiate the design process by using the approximate dimensions (16) and (17), and then optimization can be done as follows.In this subsection, the design process for frequency independent transmission line-based inductors is discussed. The following formula is used for the calculation of inductance of a strip that is suspended over a ground plane as shown in Fig. 5(a). This equation is valid only for relatively low frequencies [16]:(15)L=0.21hwnHh≪w0.21ln4hwnHh≫wwhere w, l, and h respectively denote the width and length of the strip and the distance from the ground plane, in millimeters. As an example, for l=120μm, w=70μm, and h=2.7μm, it gives L=0.024nH. Fig. 5(b) shows the simulation-based inductance values as a function of frequency, obtained by using the HFSS simulator. This figure shows that the equivalent inductance value decreases as the frequency increases.Reduction of frequency dependency can be achieved by cutting a slot in the ground plane located under the suspended strip, as shown in Fig. 6(a). In this case the following formula can be used to calculate the inductance value of a strip that is perfectly isolated from the ground plane [17,18]:(16)L=0.2lln2lw+t+0.5+0.2235w+tl(nH),where w, l, and t respectively represent the width of the strip, the length of the strip and the thickness of the strip, in millimeters. As an example, this equation gives an inductance value equal to L=0.094nH, for w=70μm, l=202μm, and t=1μm.However, in practical circuits, the exact value of the inductance may be influenced by environmental parameters such as substrate material and other ground planes and strips. For example, changing the distance between the strip and the substrate could influence its frequency dependency. Therefore, we should optimize the position and dimensions of the strip by performing several simulations.Now, consider a strip line with w=70μm that is placed 2.7μm above the silicon substrate, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Simulations in Fig. 6(b) show that it relatively acts as an independent frequency inductor in a very wide bandwidth and increasing the strip length, increases the inductance value. For example, based on these results, w=70μm and h=2.7μm approximately leads to an approximate frequency independent inductance equal to L=0.094nH for l=120μm.In this subsection, a parallel-plate structure that has been proposed to replace the lumped capacitor of the modified circuit is discussed. In this structure, one plate is the CPW ground-plane and the other one is suspended over it. This capacitor is the only tunable part of the proposed circuit and is tuned by a DC actuation voltage. This voltage causes a downward electrostatic force on the suspended plate. Increasing this voltage causes an increase in the value of the capacitance.In order to decrease the frequency dependency of the capacitor, we should decrease the distributed inductance of the suspended plate by reducing the length and increasing the width of the suspended strip to optimal sizes.The following equation is used for capacitance value calculation of a two parallel-plate capacitor and the other three allow for consideration of all the potential side effects. By using this equation, the initial dimensions are calculated for a certain capacitance value [19].(17)C=εlwh+0.77+1.06wh0.25+1.06th0.5(mF),in which l, w, and t respectively denote the length, width and thickness of the strip that is suspended over a ground plane at height h, in millimeters. For example, it gives l=385μm for C=1pF, w=1144μm, h=4μm, and t=1μm. This equation does not consider some spurious environmental variables and high-frequency effects. Hence, it is only used for initial value calculation of the upper plate dimensions and then, optimization is done by using the HFSS software. Simulation results demonstrate that C=1pF is obtained for frequencies around f0=16GHz, if l be decreased to 330µm. We have used the circuits shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) for frequency response comparison between the proposed capacitor and the ideal capacitor. Simulation results depicted in Fig. 7(c) and (d) indicate that their frequency responses are very like each other over a very wide range of frequencies.In the following, the pull-in effect in the electrostatically actuated MEMS switches is discussed. Increasing the actuation voltage applied between the two plates leads to a decrease in the distance h between the two plates. The displacement value, Δh, of the upper plate can be controlled by a DC actuation voltageV=h√(2kΔh/(ε0εrwl))[15]. This equation is true until the distance between plates decreases to 2h/3. From this point on, any further increase in the bias voltage causes an increase of the downward electrostatic force and it becomes greater than the increase in the restoring force. This in turn leads to a collapse of the upper plate over the ground plane, due to instability of the upper plate. We have selected commercial finite-element-method-based modeling and the simulation software (COMSOL) tools for the study of the electromechanical behavior of the suspended strip. Fig. 8(a) shows a 3-D view of the proposed capacitor in COMSOL tools and its deflection for actuation voltage of V=11.6 V.Based on Fig. 8(b), increasing the actuation voltage from 0 to V=11.6 V decreases the distance between the ground plane and the end of cantilever plate from 4µm to 2.4µm. However, since the upper strip has not been deformed in HFSS, this capacitance range equally corresponds to decreasing the height of the upper parallel strip from 4µm to 2.4µm, at 16GHz. Thus, as shown in Fig. 9, the final capacitance value varies from 1pF to 1.201pF.In this subsection, the scattering parameter, S21, of the proposed and the ideal T-subcircuits are compared. Fig. 10shows the first designed proposed T-subcircuit and its frequency response. As seen from the figure, its frequency response does not agree well with the ideal one due to the quality degradation caused by cutting a wide rectangular slot in the ground plane.It is for this reason that we optimized the ground plane in order to correct the frequency response. This is shown in Fig. 11(a) and the results of simulations for this case are shown in Fig. 11(b), where it is clearly shown that the frequency response is very similar with that of the ideal one in a wide range of frequencies.As shown in the ideal circuit in Fig. 2(a), the final circuit is made by connecting two grounded inductors in parallel with the input and output ports of the T-subcircuit.Fig. 12shows a 3-D view of the final circuit. In these figures, white color denotes the silicon substrate, orange (gray) color denotes the strip over the substrate and brown (black) color denotes the strip that is suspended over the substrate. Simulations performed by HFSS tools show that the proposed filter behavior is very similar to the ideal one, over a wide range of frequencies.Fig. 13shows the frequency response of the proposed and ideal circuits in the unactuated state or h=4µm. Based on this figure, a good similarity exists between them, except at the frequency of 55GHz that is caused by unwanted capacitance variations as shown in Fig. 9(a).Increasing the actuation voltage from 0 to 11.6V leads to a downward force on the suspended strip and increases its capacitance from 1pF to 1.201pF. This is equal to decreasing the distance from 4 to 3.2µm (in the HFSS simulator) and a down-shifting of the center frequency, f0, from 16.5 to 15GHz.As shown in Table 1, the proposed circuit has the smallest size achieved up to this time and it has a very low IL in compared to other tunable bandpass filters in the Ku-band. Additionally, it does not need via-holes, because it has been designed on CPW structure. Also, it uses silicon as a substrate material and has no spurious passbands over a very wide range of frequencies.Fig. 14that has been obtained from the HFSS simulator, shows the magnitude of the scattering parameters, S21 and S11 for h=4, 3.6 and 3.2µm corresponding to actuation voltages equal to 0, 9.8, and 11.6V, respectively. Based on this figure, the tuning range of this circuit is 9.8% and the fractional bandwidth (FBW) is smaller than 11.7%. Moreover, it has an IL below 2.5dB and return loss (RL) higher than 10dB in the passband over the whole tuning range.
