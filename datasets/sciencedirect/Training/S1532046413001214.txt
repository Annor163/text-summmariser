@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Advances in “omics” hardware and software technologies are bringing rare diseases research back from the sidelines. Whereas in the past these disorders were seldom considered relevant, in the era of whole genome sequencing the direct connections between rare phenotypes and a reduced set of genes are of vital relevance.This increased interest in rare genetic diseases research is pushing forward investment and effort towards the creation of software in the field, and leveraging the wealth of available life sciences data. Alas, most of these tools target one or more rare diseases, are focused solely on a single type of user, or are limited to the most relevant scientific breakthroughs for a specific niche. Furthermore, despite some high quality efforts, the ever-growing number of resources, databases, services and applications is still a burden to this area. Hence, there is a clear interest in new strategies to deliver a holistic perspective over the entire rare genetic diseases research domain.This is Diseasecard’s reasoning, to build a true lightweight knowledge base covering rare genetic diseases. Developed with the latest semantic web technologies, this portal delivers unified access to a comprehensive network for researchers, clinicians, patients and bioinformatics developers. With in-context access covering over 20 distinct heterogeneous resources, Diseasecard’s workspace provides access to the most relevant scientific knowledge regarding a given disorder, whether through direct common identifiers or through full-text search over all connected resources. In addition to its user-oriented features, Diseasecard’s semantic knowledge base is also available for direct querying, enabling everyone to include rare genetic diseases knowledge in new or existing information systems. Diseasecard is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/diseasecard/.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Rare genetic diseases research is at the forefront of the most modern personalized medicine endeavors. The rare term broadly defines disorders that affect at most 1 in 2000 patients [1] and the European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) estimates that there are approximately 6000–8000 rare diseases, affecting about 6–8% of the population [2]. Within these, about 80% are caused by genetic changes, further strengthening the relations between genotypes and phenotypes associated with these particular conditions [3,4]. Some of these chronic diseases hinder the patients’ quality of life and cause serious damage or social disability [5]. Moreover, the low patient number severely obstructs the creation of adequate research cohorts, making it very difficult to coordinate studies capable of generating results in a scientifically-relevant scale [6,7].In addition to long-term patient care improvements, understanding gene-disease associations is a fundamental goal for bioinformatics research, especially at the rare disease level, where genotype-phenotype connections are typically limited to one or a few more genes. This moves rare diseases research from a relatively minor concern to a major player in a new era of “omics” research [8,9]. Genomics, metabolomics, proteomics or pharmacogenomics, among others, benefit from the focused approach enabled by rare genetic diseases research. A direct consequence of this growing importance is the renewed interest from pharmaceutical companies in this area, which are supporting multiple worldwide initiatives towards improved rare diseases research. On a broader scope, the International Rare Diseases Consortium (IRDiRC) (http://www.irdirc.org/) is leveraging several projects on the field. RD-Connect (http://rd-connect.eu/), RareConnect (https://www.rareconnect.org/), EuRenOmics (http://eurenomics.eu/) and NeurOmics (http://rd-neuromics.eu/) are some of the highlights from IRDiRC sponsorships. On the European level, GEN2PHEN (http://www.gen2phen.org/), EU-ADR [10] (http://euadr-project.org/), or EMIF (http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/emif/) projects are actively investing in setting up state of the art research activities for rare diseases stakeholders. A key feature of these projects is their multidisciplinary approach, leveraging on the natural connections between clinicians, researchers, bioinformaticians and patients, who, for once, are active elements of the proposed strategies.With these miscellaneous initiatives, players and requirements, there is an overwhelming challenge to tackle the wealth of data being made available by next-generation sequencing hardware, omics databases, patient registries, and pharmacovigilance or electronic health records. Multiple new rare diseases research tools are emerging, focusing only a set of particular conditions. Niche databases for the domains of neurological disorders [11] or muscular problems [12], for example, tackle small specific sub-groups. While they provide high quality information and resources, their disease coverage is small and inadequate.Likewise, platforms such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM) [13,14], the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) website (http://www.rarediseases.org/) or Orphanet, among others, collect and filter available information, with a particular set of users in mind. Where OMIM is more focused on aggregating content for bioinformatics researchers, Orphanet has decade-long pedigree and content far beyond simple research data. It is geared towards clinicians, medical researchers and patients, boasting a large collection of curated clinical information such as patient registries, biobanks and specialized clinician contacts, among others, in multiple languages.Despite these high quality efforts, entropy is a recurring problem in this field with the ever-growing number of resources, databases, services and applications. Therefore, a new approach is desired, one where everyone is able to quickly access the available knowledge regarding a given set of rare disorders.Diseasecard addresses these needs by delivering a lightweight holistic perspective over the rare genetic diseases research field. Stemming from a legacy portal [15,16], a crawler-based system that kick-started a new strategy for in-context research, the new semantic Diseasecard version focuses on three fundamental elements:•The rapid and lightweight access to a comprehensive semantic network of scientifically relevant resources for a given disease, covering multiple domains from proteomics to clinical studies up to medical ontologies.The innovative in-context browsing allowing for the eased navigation amongst the multitude of connected resources without leaving the initial research focus.The open interoperability layer, making the semantic knowledge base available for everyone to query and access, and enabling the integration of rich rare diseases data in new or existing information systems.In addition, Diseasecard comprises a rich semantic layer, providing future-proof technologies for inference and reasoning over the created knowledge base. Diseasecard is publicly available online at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/diseasecard/.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented Diseasecard, a portal for rare diseases researchers, clinicians and patients. Diseasecard features a rich semantic knowledge base to deliver a lightweight holistic perspective over the wealth of genetic diseases information stemming from the growing number of “omics” research projects.Diseasecard’s results are significant in at least three major respects. (1) The use of semantic web technologies to collect connections to the most relevant resources regarding rare diseases is a pivotal step in the future of data integration and interoperability. (2) The available in-context research features – full text search and LiveView augmented browsing – enable full access to external resources within each disease workspace. (3) At last, making all data available for further inclusion in other systems, whether through LinkedData or the SPARQL endpoint, empowers other developers to enrich their systems with a myriad of connections to the most relevant rare diseases resources.The new Diseasecard represents a milestone towards semantic interoperable rare diseases knowledge, and is publicly available online at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/diseasecard/.
