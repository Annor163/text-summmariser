@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A continuum finite element model for the nanoscale plates considering the surface effect of the material is developed. Governing equations for Kirchoff and Mindlin nanoplates are derived by using the Galerkin finite element technique. The model is verified by comparing the results with available analytical solutions. The results indicate that, depending on the boundary conditions, the deflections and frequencies of the plate have a dramatic dependence on the residual surface stress and surface elasticity of the plates. The present model is an efficient tool for the analysis of the static and dynamic mechanical behaviors of nanoscale plates with complex geometry, boundary and loading conditions and material properties.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nanoscale plates are key components of actuators and sensors for nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) [1]. Naturally, it is importance to understand the static and dynamic mechanical behaviors of these advanced materials and structures for the design and manufacture of NEMS. Due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, structures at nanoscale show significant size-dependent behavior [2–4]. Therefore, the surface effect must be considered for the analysis of materials and structures at nanoscale. Some researchers applied atomistic simulation to study the size-dependent properties of nanostructures [5–7]. However, this method is difficult to apply to the analysis of NEMS with complex geometries, due to the limit of the available computational power. It is essential to find an efficient tool to analyze the mechanics behavior of nanoscale structures. Gurtin and Murdoch [8,9] proposed a modified continuum theory which incorporates the surface/interface effects into the traditional continuum mechanics. This theory has been widely used to study the mechanics response of nanoscale structures. For examples, Lim and He [10] proposed a continuum model to analyze the bending behaviors of thin elastic nanoplate of nanoscale thickness. Lu et al. [11] proposed a size-dependent thin plate model by complementing Lim and He's model. Liu and Rajapakse [12] studied the static and dynamic response of nanoscale beams based on the Gurtin–Murdoch theory. Assadi et al. [13] studied the size-dependent dynamic response of nanoplates by using the Gurtin–Murdoch theory. Wang and Feng [14,15] studied the influence of the surface effect on the buckling and vibration behaviors of nanowires. Fang et al. [16] studied the influence of the surface/interface effect on the dynamic stress of two interacting cylindrical nano-inhomogeneities under compressive waves based on the surface/interface elasticity theory.Analytical solutions are impossible for the structures with complex geometry and boundary conditions. It is necessary to develop a versatile numerical model, such as, the finite element (FE) method and the boundary element (BE) method. Wei et al. [17] proposed a kind of surface element for a two dimensional continuum FE model to take into account the surface elastic effect (based on the Gurtin–Murdoch theory). Tian and Rajapkse [18] studied the mechanics of nanoscale inhomogeneities in an elastic matrix by proposed a FE model. Feng et al. [19] developed a 3D FE model to study the resonant properties of silicon nanowires. Liu et al. [20] proposed a Galerkin-type finite element of the thin and thick beam with the surface effect. In addition, Dong and Pan [21] proposed a BE method to analyze the stress field in nano-inhomogeneities with the surface/interface effect.Nanoplates with complex geometry, boundary and loading conditions are often used in NEMS. Such complicated structural systems cannot be studied by analytical models. However, an efficient numerical model is not available at this moment for the analysis of nanoscale plates. In the present paper, a finite element model is developed to analyze the bending behavior of nanoplates with consideration of surface residual stress and surface elasticity. The present FE model is based on the plate mathematical model developed by Lu et al. [11] by using the Gurtin–Murdoch surface elasticity theory. The accuracy and convergence of the present finite element model are verified by comparing the results with the available analytical solutions. The model is used to investigate the influence of residual surface stress and surface elasticity on bending and free vibration of nanoplates with different boundary conditions.The static equilibrium equations for the bulk of the plate without considering body force areσij,j=0, whereσijdenote stresses of the bulk. According to Ref. [8], the surface stresses satisfy the following relations:(1)τβi,β±−σi3±=0whereτβi±denote the surface stresses on the surfaceS±. Usingσij,j=0and Eq. (1) we can obtain the equilibrium equations of plate with the surface effect [11](2a)Niβ,β⁎+q=Iu¨i(2b)Mαβ,β⁎−Nα3=Ju¨αwhereI=∫−h/2h/2ρdz,J=∫−h/2h/2ρz2dz,Niβ⁎=Niβ+ταi++ταi−,Mαβ⁎=Mαβ+(h/2)(τβα+−τβα−), andNij=∫−h/2h/2σijdzandMij=∫−h/2h/2σijzdz.According to Refs. [4,8], linear constitutive equations for the surface are(3)ταβ=ταβ0+Cαβγδsεγδs,τα3=τα0u3,αwhereταβ0,Cαβγδsandεγδsare the receptivity, the residual surface stresses, the surface elastic constants and surface strains. Bothταβ0andCαβγδscan be obtained from atomistic calculations.According to the Kirchhoff plate theory, the displacement components areuα=−zu3,αandu3=w. Using Eq. (2), we obtained(4)Mx,xx⁎+2Mxy,xy⁎+My,yy⁎+2(τxxw,xx+τyyw,yy)+q=0where{M,xx⁎M,yy⁎M,xy⁎}T=[D]{ψ}+(h2/2)[Cs]{ψ,ψ}={w,xxw,yy−2w,xy}T, and the material property matrices[D]and[Cs]are given in Appendix A. For static bending of the Kirchhoff plate, applying Galerkin's weighted residual method to Eq. (4) gives(5)∬A(Mx,xx⁎+2Mxy,xy⁎+My,yy⁎+2(τxxw,xx+τyyw,yy)+q)w¯dA=0Using Green's theorem, we get the weak form of Eq. (5) as(6)∬A(Mx⁎w¯,xx+2Mxy⁎w¯,xy+My⁎w¯,yy)dA+2∬A(τxxw,xx+τyyw,yy)w¯dA+∬Aqw¯dA+∫S(Vx⁎nx+Vy⁎ny)w¯dS−∫S(Mx⁎nx+Mxy⁎ny)w¯,xdS−∫S(Mxy⁎nx+My⁎ny)w¯,ydS=0whereVx⁎=Mx,x⁎+Mxy,y⁎andVx⁎=Mxy,x⁎+My,y⁎.The boundary conditions are usually expressed in terms of directions that are normal and tangent to the boundaries. These are the derivatives in the normal direction∂w¯/∂nand in the tangential direction∂w¯/∂T. Here n is the outward unit vector normal to the boundary of the plate, whose components arenxandny, T is the unit vector tangent to the boundary of the plate, whose x and y components are −nyandnx. By these definitions,w¯n=nxw¯x+nyw¯y,w¯T=−nyw¯x+nxw¯yandnx2+ny2=1. The last two boundary integrals in Eq. (6) can now be written as(7)∫S[(Mx⁎nx+Mxy⁎ny)(nxw¯n−nyw¯T)+(Mxy⁎nx+My⁎ny)(nyw¯,n+nxw¯,T)]dS=∫S[(Mx⁎nx2+My⁎ny2+2Mxy⁎nxny)w¯n+(−Mx⁎nxny+My⁎nxny+Mxy⁎(nx2−ny2))w¯T]dS=∫SMn⁎w¯ndS+∫SMT⁎w¯TdSFinally, the weak form Eq. (6) can be rewritten as(8)∬A{ψ¯}T[D]{ψ}dA+h22∬A{ψ¯}T[Cs]{ψ}dA−2∬A(τxxwxx+τyywyy)w¯dA−∬Aqw¯dA−∫s(Vn⁎+MT,T⁎)w¯ds+∫sMn⁎w¯nds=0where(9){ψ¯}=[w¯,xxw¯,yy2w¯,xy]TConsider a four-node finite element with three nodal degrees of freedom per node, i.e.,w,θxandθyas shown inFig. 1(a).The element nodal displacement vector is(10){ue}=[w1θx1θy1...w4θx4θy4]TThe displacement vector of the element and the vector of element curvatures are, receptivity,w={N}T{ue}and{ψ}=[B]T{ue}. Here the shape function{N}and the geometry matrix[B]are given in Appendix A. Substituting Eq. (9) and the weighting functions (w¯→Niandψ¯→[B]T) into Eq. (8), we obtain(11)[ke]=[kb]+[ks]+[kτ]where(12a)[kb]=∬A[B]T[D][B]dA(12b)[ks]=h22∬A[B]T[Cs][B]dA(12c)[kτ]=−2τxx∬A{N},xxT{N}dA−2τyy∬A{N},yyT{N}dAThe element nodal force vector can be expressed as{qe}=∫∫Aq{N}TdA. Assembling the element stiffness and nodal force vector, the global equilibrium equation of the system can be obtained as[K]{u}={q}, where[K],{u}and{q}denote, respectively, the global stiffness matrix, the nodal displacement vector and the nodal force matrix.For dynamic analysis, the deflection is interpolated within a plate element asw={N}T{u}eeiωt. The element mass matrix can be obtained as(13)me=I∬A{N}T{N}dAwhereI=ρh. The same interpolation functions as static case are used to obtain the mass matrix. The global equilibrium equations for dynamic analysis can be obtained in following form:(14)[M]{u¨}+[K]{u}={q}where[M]is global mass matrix. With the substitution of{u(t)}={u}eiωt, the free vibration eigenvalue problem can be obtained from Eq. (14) as(15){[K]−ω2[M]}{u}=0In the case of Mindlin plates, the shear deformation must be considered. The governing equations are [11](16a)Mx,x⁎+Mxy,y⁎−Vx=0(16b)Mxy,x⁎+My,y⁎−Vy=0(16c)Vx,x+Vy,y+q+2(τxxwxx+τyywyy)=0Applying Galerkin's weighted residual method, the following weighted residual equation can be obtained from Eq. (16):(17)∬A[(−Vx,x−Vy,y−q−2(τxxw,xx+τyyw,yy))w¯+(−Vx+Mx,x⁎+Mxy,y⁎)β¯x+(−Vy+Mxy,x⁎+My,y⁎)β¯y]dA=0wherew¯,β¯xandβ¯yare the weight functions. Using Green's theorem on the derivative terms, we can obtain the following:(18)∬A{ψ¯G}Tk[G]h{ψG}dA+∬A{ψ¯b}T[D]{ψb}dA+h22∬A{ψ¯b}T[Cs]{ψb}dA−2∬A(τxxw,xx+τyyw,yy)w¯dA=∬Aqw¯dA+∫SVnw¯dS−∫SMn⁎β¯ndS−∫SMT⁎β¯TdSwhere[G]=[G1300G23]{M,xx⁎M,yy⁎M,xy⁎}T=[D]ψb+h22[Cs]ψb[VxVy]T=k[G]h{ψG}{ψb}=(βx,xβy,yβx,y+βy,x)T{ψ¯b}=(β¯x,xβ¯y,yβ¯x,y+β¯y,x)T{ψG}=[w,x−βxw,y−βy]T{ψ¯G}=[w¯,x−β¯xw¯,y−β¯y]TVn=Vxnx+Vyny,β¯n=nxβ¯x+nyβ¯yandβ¯T=−nyβ¯x+nxβ¯y. Herenxandnyare the components of the outward unit vector normal to the boundary of the nanoplate,kis the shear correction coefficient (k=π2/12) and[G]is a shear module matrix.A eight-node plate element is used with three degrees of freedom per node (w,βxandβy), as shown in Fig. 1(b). The displacement is interpolated by using the shape function as(19){wβxβy}T=[N]{ue}where[N]is the matrix of interpolation functions, which is(20)[N]=[N100N20⋯00−N100⋯0N100N2⋯]whereNi(i=1, 2, …, 8) are shape functions, shown in Appendix B. For convenience, the sets of weighting functions (w¯,β¯xandβ¯y) are expressed as the columns of the matrix of interpolation functions[N].Using Eqs. (18) and (19) and the sets of weighting functions, we obtained the following element stiffness matrix:(21)[Ke]=[kG]+[kb]+[ks]+[kτ]where(22a)[kG]=∬A[BG]Tk[G]h[BG]dA(22b)[kb]=∬A[Bb]T[D][Bb]dA(22c)[ks]=h22∬A[Bb]T[Cs][Bb]dA(22d)[kτ]=−2τxx∬A{Nw}xxT{Nw}dA−2τyy∬A{Nw}yyT{Nw}dAwhere[BG],[Bb]and{Nw}are shown in Appendix B. In order to avoid shear locking, the reduced-integration is used to the stiffness term. In present case, for an eight-node element, the shear stiffness (22a), the bending stiffness term (22b) and the surface stiffness term (22c) are obtained by using the 2×2 Gaussian integration scheme. Finally, the element nodal force vector is{qe}=∬Aq{Nw}TdA.In the dynamic analysis, the element mass matrix can be obtained by using the same interpolation functions as the static case. Therefore the element mass matrix can be expressed as(23)[me]=∬AI{Nw}T{Nw}dA+J∬A({Nβx}TNβx+{Nβy}T{Nβy})dAwhereNβxandNβyare shown in Appendix B.I=ρhandJ=ρh3/12.In order to assess the accuracy of the developed finite element method, the static deflection and frequency of a simply supported plate made of Si is computed and compared with the analytical result. The results from the traditional model are also presented to get a quantitative assessment of the influence of surface effects. It is should be noted that the surface elasticity constants and residual surface tension can be determined by atomic simulations, which indicate that the elasticity constants and residual surface stresses of some materials (i.e. FCC Al, diamond Si) can be either positive or negative, depending on the crystallographic structure of the materials. In the present paper, the bulk and surface elastic constants of Si (100) have been obtained by Shenoy [7] by using the embedded atom method, and the properties are:E=107Gpa,υ=0.33,μ0=−2.7779N/m,λ0=−4.4939N/mandτ0=0.6056N/m.According to the Kirchhoff plate theory, for a nanoplate of isotopic material property, the equilibrium equation can be expressed as [11](24)Deff∇4w−2τ0∇2w=q(x,y)whereDeff=(Eh3/(12(1−ν2)))+(Esh2/2)andEs=2μ0+λ0. If the lateral loading applied on the plate isq(x,y)=q0sin(mπx/a)sin(nπy/b), we can obtain the deflection of the plate from Eq. (24) as follows:(25)w=q0sin(mπx/a)sin(nπy/b)Deffπ4[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]2+2τ0π2[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]In the case of a uniformly distributed loadq0on the plate, we can representq0in a double trigonometric series as(26)q0=16q0π2∑m=13,5,...∑m=13,5,...1mnsin(mπx/a)sin(nπy/b)Using Eqs. (25) and (26), we can get(27)w=∑m=13,5,...∑m=13,5,...16q0sin(mπx/a)sin(nπy/b)mnπ4{Deffπ4[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]2+2τ0[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]}Eq. (27) is the solution of a plate with surface effect under a loadq0uniformly distributed.According to the Mindlin plate theory, for a plate of isotopic material property, the equilibrium equation can be expressed as [11](28)Deff∇4w=(1−DeffkGh∇2)(q(x,y)+2τ0∇2w)wherekis the shear factor. Following the above process for the Kirchhoff plate, we can obtain the deflection of a Mindlin plate with the surface effect under a uniformly distributed loadq0as(29)w=∑m=13,5,...∑m=13,5,...16q0[1+(mπ/a)2+(nπ/b)2]sin(πx/a)sin(πy/b)mnπ4{Deff(1+2τ0/k/G/h)π2[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]2+2τ0[(m/a)2+(n/b)2]}We chose a square plate whose dimension is a=b=200nm. The deflections of the plate based on the Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate theories are computed by using 14 by 14 elements. For comparison, the classical solutions which neglect the surface stress are also presented.Fig. 2 plots the deflection of the simply supported Kirchhoff plate under a uniformly distributed loadq0=1000kN/m2. It can be seen that the finite element solution agrees well with the analytical solution. The relative error is within 2%. Such accuracy is adequate for most practical applications. It is also found that the surface effect reduces the deflection of the plate, this means that the surface effect makes the plate stiffer.Fig. 3 shows the deflection of the simply supported Mindlin plate. Once again, the FEM solution agrees well with the analytical solution. The relative error is also less than 2%.In order to show the effect of surface elasticity and residual surface stress on the deflection of plate with different boundary conditions, the positive surface elasticity constantsμ0=2.7779N/mandλ0=4.4939N/mand negative residual surface stressτ0=−0.6056N/mare assumed for the calculation.Figs. 4, 5 and 6 show the deflections of plate (at y=b/2) with cantilever, simply supported, and clamped boundary conditions, respectively. It is found that, for a positive residual surface stress, the cantilever nanoplate exhibits a softer elastic behavior but the simply supported and clamped nanoplates exhibit a stiffer elastic behavior (vice versa for a negative residual surface stress). The similar phenomenon has been found for the bending of nanowires [22]. This phenomenon can be explained by Laplace–Young equations〈σij+−σij−〉ninj=τ0καβ, whereniis the unit vector normal to the surface. From Laplace–Young equations, it can be seen that the signs of the curvatureκαβand residual surface stressτ0during the static bending of the nanoplates determine the stiffer or softer behavior of nanoplates. If the signs of the curvatureκαβand residual surface stressτ0are the same, it can result in a positive distributed transverse force (which has the same direction with the external load and will increase the deflection of the bending nameplate). If the curvatureκαβand residual surface stressτ0have an opposite sign, it will result in a negative distributed transverse force. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that a positive residual surface stress (τ0>0) increases the deflection of the nanoplate. This is due to the fact that a downward curvature occurs in the cantilever nanoplate. This leads to a positive curvature and results in a positive distributed force, which increases the deflection of the nanoplate. In the same way, we can explain that a positive residual surface stress (τ0>0) decreases the deflection of nanoplates with simply supported boundary conditions (vice versa forτ0<0).As shown in Fig. 5, an upward curvature occurs in the simply supported nanoplate. This leads to a negative curvature and results in a negative distributed force which decreases the deflection of the nanoplate. For the bending of nanoplates with all edges clamped, both downward and upward curvatures occur in Fig. 6. Due to the upward curvature was dominant. Therefore, a positive residual surface stress (τ0>0) decreases the deflection of clamped nanoplate.From Figs. 4–6, we know that a positive surface elasticity reduces the deflections of the nanoplates, but the negative one increases the deflections. Moreover, it is found that the cantilever plates are most significantly influenced by the surface effects, followed by the simply supported nanoplates, and clamped nanoplates. Note that the influence of surface elasticity and residual surface stress on the deflection of the Mindlin plates is quite similar to that for the Kirchhoff plates. Therefore, the results for the Mindlin plates are not shown here.In order to study the influence of the shear deformation on the bending deflection of the plates, the solutions of the Kirchhoff and Mindlin plates are plot inFig. 7. It can be seen that the shear deformation makes the plate softer. Therefore, the deflection of the Mindlin plate is always larger than that of the Kirchhoff plate. However, the influence of the shear deformation on the deflection of the plate decreases with decreasing thickness of the plate.Based on the Kirchhoff plate theory, the motion governing equation can be expressed as [11](30)Deff∇4w−2τ0∇2w=−Iw¨whereI=ρh. Under the simply supported boundary condition, we obtained the natural frequency as(31)ωnm=Deff(λn2+λm2)2+2τ0(λn2+λm2)I,(n,m=1,2…)whereλn=nπ/aandλm=mπ/b, a and b are, respectively, the length and width of the nanoplate. It should be noted that Eq. (31) can be obtained from our previous study [23] by neglecting the nonlocal effect (μ=0).Based on the Mindlin plate theory, the motion governing equation can be expressed as [11](32a)k2Gh(βx,x+βy,y+∇2w)+2τ0∇2w=Iw¨(32b)D[βx,xx+12(1−υ)βx,yy+12(1+υ)βy,xy]+h22[(2u0+λ0)βx,xx+(λ0+u0)βy,xy+u0βx,yy]−k2Gh(βx+wx)=Jβ¨x(32c)D[βy,yy+12(1−υ)βy,xx+12(1+υ)βx,xy]+h22[(2u0+λ0)βy,yy+(λ0+u0)βx,xy+u0βy,xx]−k2Gh(βy+wy)=Jβ¨yThe natural frequency of a simply supported nanoplate is(33)ωmn=−g1−g73−g833g0Whereg0,g1,g7andg8are shown in Appendix B. It should be noted that Eq. (33) can be obtained in our previous study [23] by neglecting the nonlocal effect (μ=0).In this subsection, the frequencies of nanoplates based on both Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate theories are computed by using 10×10 element mesh configuration.Table 1 lists the fundamental frequencies of simply supported nanoplate with varying thicknesses. Comparing the FEM results with the analysis results, it can be seen that the error is within 1%. Such accuracy is adequate for most practical situations. Comparing the fundamental frequencies using FEM with the results for classical theory, it found that the surface effect has a substantial effect on the fundamental frequencies of thinner nanoplate. The influence of the surface effect on the fundamental frequencies increases with the decreasing thickness of nanoplate.Table 2 shows the fundamental frequencies of nanoplate with different aspect ratio (a/b). It can be seen that the influence of the surface effect on fundamental frequencies is more obvious if the aspect ratio of the nanoplate equals to 1.The fundamental frequencies of nanoplate with clamped boundary condition are shown inTable 3. It is found that when the thickness is larger than 15nm the surface effect may be neglected since the relative error is within 1%.Table 4 lists the fundamental frequencies of cantilever nameplates. It is found that the fundamental frequencies calculated for cantilever Si (100) nanoplates are lower than those calculated without the surface effect.Comparing Tables 1–4, one can conclude that the influence of surface effect on the fundamental frequencies of the nanoplate depends on the signs of surface elasticity constants and residual surface stress, nanoplate thickness and boundary conditions. For example,Table 5 shows the fundamental frequencies of nanoplates with only consideration of the residual surface stress. It is found that a positive residual surface stress increases the fundamental frequencies of nanoplates with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions, but decreases the fundamental frequencies of a cantilever nanoplate (and vice versa for a residual surface stress).This trends were similar to the case of nanowire bending [22]. In addition, a comparison of Tables 1, 3, 4 with Table 5 suggests that, a negative surface elastic constant decreases the fundamental frequencies of nanoplates. As an additional example, for a simply supported nanoplate with the surface effect, the natural frequency has been derived as Eq. (31), and the classical natural frequency for a simply supported nanoplate isωnm2=D(λn2+λm2)2/ρh. The difference is derived as(34)ωnms2−ωnm2=[Esh22(λn2+λm2)+2τ0](λn2+λm2)For Si [100],Esh2(λn2+λm2)/2<0and2τ0>0. When thickness h is small, the surface effect will increase the frequencies. As thickness h increases, Eq. (34) will be negative. At this situation, the frequency from the FEM with surface effect becomes smaller than the classical result. Based on this, it is not difficult to understand why the frequencies from FEM with surface effect are smaller than the classical results for h=15nm and h=20nm, in Table 3.Table 6 shows the fundamental frequencies of simply supported Mindlin nanoplates of various values of thickness.Once again, the relative errors between the FEM results and the analysis results are less than 1%. The fundamental frequencies show a negligible dependency on the surface effect if the thickness of the nanoplate is sufficiently large (e.g., >25nm). Note that the influence of surface effect on the frequencies of the Mindlin plates is quite similar to that for the Kirchhoff plates. Therefore, the results for the Mindlin plates are not shown here.In this subsection, we use the present FEM to calculate the fundamental frequency of a T-shape nanoplate silicon nanoresonator, which is widely used in MEMS/NEMS [24–26]. The thickness of the plate is h=2nm and the FEM mesh is shown inFig. 8. he device has relatively complicated geometries and boundary conditions. First, consider the case that edge AB is clamped and the remaining edges are free. The fundamental frequency of the resonator is calculated as 41.593GHZ. If neglecting surface effect, the fundamental frequency is calculated as 52.126GHZ. This suggests that the surface effect decreases the frequency of the resonator. Next, consider the case that edge AB clamped, edge EF simply supported and the remaining edges free. The fundamental frequencies of the plate calculated are 87.753GHZ if the surface effect is included in the model and 90.430GHZ if the surface effect is ignored. In this boundary condition, the surface effect increases the frequency of the resonator.
