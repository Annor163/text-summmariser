This paper proposes an efficient and Feature-preserving Locally Optimal Projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction. Our operator is bilateral weighted, taking both spatial and geometric feature information into consideration for feature-preserving approximation. We then present an accelerated FLOP operator based on the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE), which produces reconstruction results close to those generated using the complete point set data, to within a given accuracy. Additionally, we extend our approach to time-varying data reconstruction, called the Spatial–Temporal Locally Optimal Projection operator (STLOP), which efficiently generates temporally coherent and stable feature-preserving results. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient and robust for feature-preserving geometry reconstruction on both static models and time-varying data sets.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Reconstructing the geometry from raw scanned data has been an active research topic over the last two decades. Although various reconstruction methods have been proposed [1–8], many problems still remain to be addressed due to geometry shape complexity and noise (outliers), in addition, with high accuracy reconstruction requirements and newly arisen applications. Surface reconstruction methods (e.g., [2,4,5,9–11]) work well only for input point set data that is densely sampled and from which the orientation of the points can be accurately deduced. Point Set Surfaces (PSS) defined by local moving least squares (MLS) approximations of the point set data [10,12] have been proven to be a powerful approach. However, due to the employment of plane fit operation, PSS is highly unstable in regions of high curvature where the sampling rate usually drops significantly.To avoid using local surface approximation and normal estimation, Lipman et al. [7] develop a parameterization-free Locally Optimal Projection operator (LOP) for geometry reconstruction. This method is robust to noise and outliers of raw scanned data. However, the LOP method encodes only the spatial relationship between input points while completely ignoring underlying surface geometry. It thus might fail to capture geometric features (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, LOP is computationally expensive for reconstructing large point set data, while large data is commonly generated using laser and structured light scanners.In this paper, we introduce an efficient and Feature-preserving Locally Optimal Projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction. We first develop a bilateral-weighted local optimal projection operator for preserving features, which works by taking both spatial and geometric feature information. Adaptive local-support parameter determination is exploited for robust projection. We then present an accelerated FLOP, which is based on the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) [14] for the original point-set data. We show that reconstruction results by the accelerated FLOP are close to those generated using the complete point set data, to within a given accuracy, while time complexity is reduced significantly. Finally we show how FLOP can be extended for efficient and robust reconstruction of time-varying data.In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:•Developing a feature-preserving locally optimal projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction (Section 3.2).Proposing a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) based random sampling technique to accelerate local optimal projection (Section 3.3).Introducing a fast spatial–temporal locally optimal projection operator (STLOP) for reconstructing time-varying data (Section 4).Although the proposed FLOP algorithm is referred to as a “reconstruction” algorithm, it can also be considered as a filtering/denoising algorithm. It is very useful for the preprocessing for the following methods, such as MLS [10], APSS [8], RBF [11], MPU [4], and Poisson surface reconstruction [5], since these methods require relatively clean input. In this sense, our FLOP is complementary with these methods.
