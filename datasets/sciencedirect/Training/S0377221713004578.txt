@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we present a new approach, based on the Nearest Interval Approximation Operator, for dealing with a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy-valued objective functions.By the way we have established a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (K.K.T) kind of Pareto optimality conditions, for the resulting interval multiobjective program. To this end, we made use of gH-differentiability of involved interval-valued functions.Two algorithms play a pivotal role in the proposed method. The first one returns a nearest interval approximation to a given fuzzy number. The other one makes use of K.K.T conditions to deliver a Pareto optimal solution of the above mentioned resulting interval program.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many decisions that we make in real life cannot be modeled easily in deterministic terms because of imprecision surrounding involved data. In this connection, the noted philosopher Nietzche was quoted as saying “No one is gifted with immaculate perception”. This has also been well expressed by the Physics Nobel laureate Feynman who once wrote: “When dealing with a mathematical model, special attention should be paid to imprecision in data”. Zadeh ’s incompatibility principle [17] stipulating that: “When the complexity of a system increases, our ability to formulate precise and yet meaningful statement on this system decreases up to a threshold beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characteristics”, is also instructive in this regards.This gives substance to the study of mathematical models under uncertainty. As probability theory is a matured segment and a familiar territory of mathematics, it is not a surprise that early works on mathematical programming under uncertainty was devoted to situations where randomness is in the state of affairs [1,28,29,40]. Nevertheless, imprecision cannot be equated with randomness. As a matter of fact, there is a qualitatively different type of imprecision (vagueness) which cannot be tackled with probabilistic apparatus [43]. This has rightly led some researchers to embark upon the investigation of ways of integrating fuzzy relations and/or fuzzy quantities into mathematical programming models [23,34,44].In this paper, we consider a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy objective functions.This is an ill-defined problem. Neither solution concepts (like Pareto Optimality) nor existing approaches (like the weighting method), introduced for deterministic multiobjective programming, can be blindly applied.For these tools to be applied, they should be properly tailored to take into consideration the fuzziness surrounding the problem.Moreover, existing approaches for solving the above mentioned problem either caricature the reality or are computationally demanding.We propose here a new approach that do not give a bad reflect of the reality and in the same time yields a computationally tractable deterministic problem.At the heart of our approach lies the idea of approximating involved fuzzy quantities by their respective nearest interval approximations. This helps avoiding pitfalls due to severe oversimplification of the reality.The challenging task of singling out a solution of the resulting interval optimization problem is also addressed.The remaining of the paper unfolds as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief primer on notions of real interval and fuzzy numbers. In section 3, we discuss the concept of the nearest interval approximation of a fuzzy quantity. In Section 4, we present our approach for dealing with a multiobjective programming problem with fuzzy number coefficients. Section 5 is devoted to a numerical example for the sake of illustration.In Section 6, we give a critical analysis of existing methods for optimization problems with several fuzzy objective functions. Section 7 is devoted to an assessment of our method in comparison with existing ones.We end up, in Section 8 with some concluding remarks along with perspectives for further research in this field.We denote by KCthe family of all bounded closed intervals inR; i.e.,KC={[a,b]|a,b∈Randa⩽b}.For A∈KC, we write A=[aL,aU] where aLand aUare respectively the lower and the upper bounds of A.The center and the width of an interval A=[aL,aU] are respectively given by:ac=12[aL+aU]aS=aU-aLThe generalization of arithmetic inRto KCmay be found in Moore [36].The main idea of interval arithmetic is as follows.Let ∗∈{+,−,·,÷} be a binary operation inR. If A, B∈KCthen(1)A∗B={a∗b|a∈Aandb∈B}defines a binary operation on KC.In the case of division, it is assumed that 0 is not a member of the interval B.Operations on intervals used in this paper may be explicitly obtained from (1) as follows:A+B=[aL,aU]+[bL,bU]=[aL+bL,aU+bU]kA=k[aL,aU]=[kaL,kaU]fork⩾0[kaU,kaL]fork<0where k is a real number.In the sequel, we’ll also use the generalized Hukuhara difference [7], defined as follows. For A, B∈KC,A⊖gHB=CiffeitherA=B+CorB=A+(-1)CThe gH-difference has many interesting properties, for example A⊖gHA={0}.Moreover if A=[a,b] and B=[c,d],A⊖gHB=[min(a-c,b-d),max(a-c,b-d)]The following are the two main order relations defined on KC[25,42].Let A=[aL,aU] and B=[bL,bU].•The order relation ⩽LUis defined as follows:(2)A⩽LUBifandonlyifaL⩽bLandaU⩽bUThe order relations ⩽LSand ⩾LSare defined as follows:(3)A⩽LSBifandonlyifaL⩽bLandaS⩽bS(4)A⩾LSBifandonlyifaU⩾bUandaS⩽bSThe width of an interval can be regarded as an uncertainty (noise), risk, or a type of variance. Therefore, an interval with smaller width and larger upper (smaller lower) bound is considered better for maximization (minimization) purposes.Proposition 2.125If A⩽LSB then A⩽LUBIn this paper we consider interval-valued functions of the type:F:X⊂Rn→KC.In the sequel, F(x) is denoted by [fL(x),fU(x)].LetH:KC×KC→R+be given byH(A,B)=max{maxa∈Ad(a,B),maxb∈Bd(b,A)}whered(a,B)=minb∈B|a-b|.It is shown in [16] that (KC,H) is a metric space.Let F be an interval-valued function defined on a convex setX⊂Rn.Then:(a)F is said to be LU-convex at x∗ ifF(λx∗+(1-λ)x)⩽LUλF(x∗)+(1-λ)F(x)for all λ∈(0,1) and x∈X.F is said to be LS-convex at x∗ ifF(λx∗+(1-λ)x)⩽LSλF(x∗)+(1-λ)F(x)for all λ∈(0,1) and x∈X.The following result, the proof of which may be found elsewhere [4], will be used in the sequel.Proposition 2.2Let X be a convex subset ofRnand F an interval-valued function defined on X. Then the following properties hold true.(a)F is LU-convex at x∗if and only if fLand fUare convex at x∗.F is LS-convex at x∗if and only if fLand fUare convex at x∗.If F is LS-convex at x∗then F is LU-convex at x∗.An interval-valued function F defined onX⊂Rnis said to be continuous at x∘ if for every ε>0, there exists a δ>0 such that ∥x−x∘∥<δ implies H(F(x),F(x∘))<ε.If F(x)=[fL(x),fU(x)] then the following result the proof of which may be found in [4] holds true.Proposition 2.3Let F be an interval-valued function defined onX⊂Rnand x∘∈X. Then F is continuous at x∘if and only if fLand fUare continuous at x°.For more details on continuity of interval-valued functions, the reader may consult [4,13].Consider a real interval T. The gH-derivative of an interval-valued function F: T→KCat t∘ is defined as:(5)F′(t∘)=limh→0F(t∘+h)⊖gHF(t∘)hIf F′(t∘)∈KCsatisfying (5) exists, we say that F is (gH)-differentiable at t∘. If F is gH-differentiable at each point t∈T, we say that F is gH-differentiable on T.The generalization of the above definition of gH-derivative to interval-valued function defined onRnis as follows.Let F be an interval-valued function defined onX⊂Rnand letx°=(x°1,…,x°n) be a fixed element of X.We consider the interval-valued functionhi(xi)=F(x°1,…,x°i-1,xi,x°i+1,…,x°n).If hiis gH-differentiable at x°i, then we say that F has the ith partial gH-derivative at x° denoted by∂F∂xigH(x°)and∂F∂xigH(x°)=hi′(x°i).Now we say that F is continuously gH-differentiable at x° if all the partial gH-derivatives∂F∂x1gH(x°),…,∂F∂xngH(x°)exist on some neighborhoods of x° and are continuous at x°(in the sense of Section 2.2.2).The following interesting result, the proof of which may be found in [4], will be used in the sequel.Proposition 2.4Let F be an interval-valued function defined onX⊂Rn.If F is continuously gH-differentiable at x°, then fL+fUis also continuously differentiable at x°.Another interesting result, the proof of which may be found in [6], is of great help in checking the gH-differentiability of an interval valued function.Proposition 2.5Let F be an interval-valued function defined onX⊂Rnand suppose F(x)=[fL(x),fU(x)]. Then, F is continuously differentiable atx°, if and only if fLandfUare differentiable (in the usual sense at x°).A fuzzy subsetãof the real lineRwith membership functionuã:R→[0,1]is called a fuzzy number if:(i)ãis normal, i.e. there isx0∈Rsuch thatuã(x0)=1.ãis fuzzy convex that is:uã(λx1+(1-λ)x2)⩾min(uã(x1),uã(x2))forx1,x2∈R,λ∈[0,1].Suppã={x∈R|uã(x)>0}¯is bounded.A useful tool for dealing with a fuzzy number is its α-cut.The α-cut of a fuzzy numberãis the crisp set defined as follows.ãα={x∈R|uã(x)⩾α}.According to the definition of a fuzzy number, every α-cut of a fuzzy number is a closed interval.Therefore, in the sequelãα=ãαL,ãαUwhereãαL=inf{x∈R|uã(x)⩾α}andãαU=sup{x∈R|uã(x)⩾α}.For more details on fuzzy numbers, the reader may consult Dubois and Prade [17].In this paper, the space of fuzzy numbers ofRis denoted byF(R).In the sequel we’ll also use the notion of Core of a fuzzy number.The Core ofãdenoted by Core(ã)is defined as followsCore(ã)={x∈R|uã(x)=1}.A metric has been defined inF(R)as follows:forã,b̃∈F(R),dF(R)(ã,b̃)=supα∈[0,1]dH(aα∼,bα∼)where dHstands for the Hausdorff metric.Definition 3.1An interval approximation of a fuzzy number is an operatorC:F(R)→KCsuch that forã∈F(R),(i)C(ã)⊂SuppãCore(ã)⊂C(ã)∀ε>0,∃δ>0|dF(R)(ã,b̃)<δ⇒H(C(ã),C(b̃))<εA Nearest Interval Approximation (NIA) of a fuzzy numberã, with respect to a metricdF(Ris an interval approximation ofã,Cd(ã)that minimizesdF(R)(ã,C(ã))for all C belonging to the space of interval approximation operators of fuzzy numbers.This means for any interval approximationC(ã)ofãwe have thatdF(R)(Cd(ã),ã)⩽dF(R)(C(ã),ã).Remark 3.1In the above definition an interval [a,b] is considered as the fuzzy numberãwhose membership function is the indicator of [a,b], i.e.,uã(x)=1ifx∈[a,b]0otherwiseDefinefL:[0,1]→Rα→fL(α)=ãαLandfU:[0,1]→Rα→fU(α)=ãαUthenCd(ã)=∫01fL(α)dα,∫01fU(α)dαFor the proof of this proposition we refer the reader to [20].Algorithm 1•Start•Readuã(x)•Putinf{x∈R|uã(x)⩾α}=ãαLsup{x∈R|uã(x)⩾α}=ãαUwhere α is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1•DefinefL(α)=ãαLandfU(α)=ãαU•Find∫01fL(α)dα=NãLand∫01fU(α)dα=NãU•Putcd(ã)=NãL,NãU•Printcd(ã)•StopWe consider a mathematical program of the form:(P1)Min(f̃1(x),…,f̃k(x))subjecttox∈X={x∈Rn|gi(x)⩽0;i=1,…,m}wheref̃j(j=1,…,k)are functions fromRntoF(R)and gi(i=1,…,m) are functions fromRntoR.This model comes up in several applications including water resources management [9], production planning problems [19], power plant maintenance scheduling [12].It is not a loss of generality to focus on the case of deterministic constraints. As a matter of fact, the literature is rich of papers addressing the problem of converting fuzzy constraints into crisp ones. See for example [8,33]. (P1) is an ill stated problem due to the presence of several objective functions coupled to the fuzziness surrounding involved data.Therefore the optimum optimorum does not exist for this problem and we have to seek for some satisficing solution.Moreover, existing approaches for the deterministic case, like the weighting method cannot be applied blindly. They should be tailored to make them suitable for the fuzzy case.Here, the original problem is converted into deterministic terms using approximate transformations.We take advantage of the notion of the nearest interval approximation of a fuzzy number to obtain a suitable approximate of (P1). A solution of this deterministic counterpart is considered as a satisficing solution to (P1).It is worth to note that the deterministic counterpart of (P1), by our approach, has the same linear or non linear structure as (P1).The only one difference between (P1) and its counterpart stems in the fact that, while (P1) has fuzzy parameters, its counterpart has interval coefficients.To find a solution of (P1), we approximate it by the following interval multiobjective program:(P2)Min(F1(x),…,Fk(x))x∈XwhereFi(x)=fiL(x),fiU(x)stands for the nearest interval approximation (NIA) off̃i(x). Remember that the nearest interval operator Cdhas the following desired properties.Cd(ã)⊂SuppãCore(ã)⊂Cd(ã)Cdis a continuous operator.Moreover, it has not the inconvenience of deffuzification operators that transform a fuzzy number into a real number, leading to a loss of too much information. More than this, the NIA operator is optimal in the sense that it is among interval approximation operators of a fuzzy member, the one that minimize the distance to the fuzzy number.In what follows, we introduce the notion of Pareto optimality for (P2). As can be expected this notion depends on the order relation considered on KC.Definition 4.1x∗∈X is said to be a LU Pareto optimal solution of (P2) if there is no x∈X such that Fi(x)⩽LUFi(x∗) ∀iwith at least one l∈{1,…,k} such that Fl(x)<LUFl(x∗).x∗∈X is said to be a LS Pareto optimal solution of (P2) if there is no x∈X such that Fi(x)⩽LSFi(x∗) ∀iwith at least l∈{1,…,k} such that Fl(x)<LUFl(x∗).If x∗is LU Pareto optimal of (P2) then x∗is LS Pareto optimal of (P2).Suppose that x∗ is LU Pareto optimal of (P2) and not LS Pareto optimal of (P2). Then there is x∈X such that Fi(x)⩽LSFi(x∗) ∀iwith at least one l∈{1,…,k} such that Fl(x)<LSFl(x∗). By Proposition 2.1, we can say that there is x∈X such thatFi(x)⩽LUFi(x∗)∀iand Fl(x)<LUFl(x∗). But this contradicts the fact that x∗ is LU Pareto optimal of (P2) and we are done.As (P2) is a good approximation of (P1) we’ll define satisficing solutions of (P1) as follows.□•x∗∈X is an LU-satisficing solution of (P1) if it is an LU-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).x∗∈X is an LS-satisficing solution of (P1) if it is an LS-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).From Proposition 4.1 we obtain the following result.Proposition 4.2If x∗is an LU-satisficing solution of (P1) then x∗is an LS-satisficing solution of (P1).In this section we are going to prove some Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type Pareto optimality conditions for problem (P2).The conditions are based on gH-differentiability of interval-valued functions (see Section 2.2.3).Theorem 4.1Consider (P2) and assume that functionsFi:Rn→KC(i=1,…,k)are continuously gH-differentiable at x∗.IffiL+fiU(i=1,…,k)are convex functions and if there areλi∗>0(i=1,…,k)andμj∗⩾0j=1,…,msuch that:(i)∑i=1kλi∗∇fiL+fiU(x∗)+∑j=1mμj∗∇gj(x∗)=0μj∗gj(x∗)=0forallj∈{1,…,m}then x∗is an LU-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).We define real-valued functionshi(x)=λi∗fiL+fiU(x);i=1,…,m.Since by hypothesis Fi(x), i=1,…, k are convex functions we have by Proposition 2.2 thatfiLandfiUare convex for all i and thenfiL+fiUare also convex for all i. Therefore hi(i=1,…, m) are convex functions. Since Fi;i=1,…, k are gH-differentiable at x∗, we have by Proposition 2.3 that hi; i=1,…, k are differentiable at x∗. As∇hi(x∗)=λi∗∇fiL+fiU(x∗),we have from (i) and (ii) that:∑i=1k∇hi(x∗)+∑j=1mμj∗∇gj(x∗)=0anduj∗gj(x∗)=0for all j∈{1,…, m} by Karush–Kuhn–Tucker for multiobjective with (real-valued) functions, x∗ is Pareto optimal for the multiobjective program:(P3)Min(h1(x),…,hk(x))x∈XSuppose now that x∗ is not an LU-Pareto optimal solution for (P2).Then there is x∈X such that:F1(x)⩽LUF1(x∗)⋮Fk(x)⩽LUFk(x∗)with Fl(x)≠Fl(x∗) for some l∈{1,…, k}.This is tantamount to say that there is x∈X such that for all i, we have eitherfiL(x)<fiL(x∗)fiU(x)⩽fiU(x∗)orfiL(x)⩽fiL(x∗)fiU(x)<fiU(x∗)orfiL(x)<fiL(x∗)fiU(x)<fiU(x∗)Therefore we have that for all ihi(x)<hi(x∗).This means that x∗ is not Pareto optimal for (P3). This is a contradiction.Hence x∗ is an LU-Pareto optimal solution for (P2).□If assumptions ofTheorem 4.1hold then x∗is an LS-Pareto optimal solution for (P2).This comes from Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 4.1.□If assumptions ofTheorem 4.1hold then x∗is an LU-satisficing solution and an LS-satisficing solution of (P1).This comes from Theorem 4.1 from Corollary 4.1and from Definition 4.3.□From the above discussion we can derive the following algorithm for finding a satisficing solution of (P1).Algorithm 2Input: k,mobjective functions:f̃1(x),…,f̃k(x)constraint functions: g1(x),…, gm(x).1.Finding nearest interval approximation off̃1(x),…,f̃k(x).(a)Put l=1(b)Repeat until breakIf l⩽k Go to Algorithm 1 with inputf̃l(x)FindflL(x)andflU(x)Else, break and go to (c).2.Finding a satisificing solution of (P1)(c)Fixλi∗>0(i=1,…,k).(d)chooseμj∗⩾0(j=1,…,m)such that the system (S) is compatible(S)∑i=1kλi∗∇fiL+fiU(x)+∑j=1mμj∗∇gj(x)=0μj∗gj(x)=0;j={1,…,m}(e)Solve (S) let x∗ its solution go to (g)(f)If such{uj∗}jcannot be found go to (h)(g)Print: “x∗ is a satisficing solution of (P1)”.(h)Print: “There is no satisficing solution of (P1)”.(i)Stop.It is worth mentioning that rather than the approximation approach described in this paper, an equivalence approach can be considered by exploring an Embedding Theorem for fuzzy numbers described in [35].In this section we illustrate the proposed method by a numerical example.Consider the following multiobjective program:(P4)Minc̃11x1+c̃21x2,c̃12x1+c̃22x2subjectto-x1-x2⩽-6-2x1-x2⩽-9wherec̃jl(l=1,2;j=1,2)are fuzzy numbers the membership function of which are given below.μc̃11(x)=2x-1forx∈[0.5,1]-2x+3forx∈[1,1.5]0elsewhereμc̃21(x)=5x-9forx∈[1.8,2]-x+3forx∈[2,3]0elsewhereμc̃12(x)=12xforx∈[0,2]-x+3forx∈[2,3]0elsewhereμc̃22(x)=xforx∈[0,1]-12x+32forx∈[1,3]0elsewhereUsing Algorithm 1, we obtain near interval approximations of these fuzzy numbers as follows.cdc̃11=∫01(α+1)2dα,∫01(3-α)2dα=[0.75,1.25]cdc̃21=∫01(α+9)5dα,∫01(3-α)dα=[1.9,2.5]cdc̃12=∫012αdα,∫01(3-α)dα=[1,2.5]cdc̃22=∫01αdα,∫01(3-2α)dα=[0.5,2]It is worth pointing out the fact that, as expected, these intervals contain the core and are included in the support of the corresponding fuzzy number.The counterpart of the System (S) for (P4) is as follows:(§)λ10.751.9+1.252.5+λ210.5+2.52+μ1-1-2+μ2=0μ1(-x1-x2+6)=0μ2(-2x1-x2+9)=0λ1>0,λ2>0,μ1⩾0,μ2⩾0So if we findλ1∗>0,λ2∗>0andμ1∗⩾0,μ2∗⩾0andx∗=x1∗,x2∗such thatλ1∗,λ2∗,μ1∗,μ2∗,x1∗,x2∗verifies the above system, then according to Corollary 4.2,x1∗,x2∗is a satisficing solution of (P3). Forλ1∗=λ2∗=1, the first equation of (§) readsμ1+μ2=0.75+1.25+1.0+2.5=5.52μ1+μ2=1.90+2.5+2.0=6.9which yieldsμ1∗=1.4>0μ2∗=4.1>0As x∗=(3,3) is the solution of the Cramerian systemx1+x2=62x1+x2=9We see that the vector (1,1,1.4,4.1,3,3) is a solution of (§).Therefore x∗=(3,3) is a satisficing solution of (P4).Remark 5.1Here we have considered a linear example for the sake of clarity and simplicity of exposition.If the problem at hand is nonlinear, the resulting problem will be a nonlinear program with interval coefficients and we can apply the algorithm described in Section 4.5.One may also apply methods from Interval Optimization [25].Without any claim for exhaustivity, Table 1below provide a classement of main existing approaches for mathematical programs with several fuzzy objective functions.The methods are mapped against the grid of how fuzziness is dealt with. This reveals strength and weaknesses of methods that in turn, provides some guidance as to which method may be appropriate for a given circumstance.As can be seen from Table 1, existing approaches for solving multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy objective functions are either effective (see e.g. [3,11,22,24]) or computationally efficient (see e.g. [15,21,31,37]) but not both.The approach proposed here strikes a balance between the faithful translation of the original fuzzy problem into deterministic terms and the computational attractiveness of the resulting deterministic program.As a matter of fact, involved fuzzy quantities are not replaced by real values(leading to a big loss of information and a bad caricature of the reality). Rather, they are replaced by intervals that capture essential features of original fuzzy quantities (see Section 3) and that are closest to the corresponding fuzzy quantities in the sense of Definition 3.2. This brings some level of effectiveness to our approach. Computational efficiency of our method is due to the fact that, one has just to solve a simple system of equations rather than complex optimization problems, in order to single out solutions to the resulting problem.The fact that our approach combines the two features of computational efficiency and effectiveness gives it a huge advantage over existing ones.We have described an approach that strikes a balance between effectiveness and efficiency while coping with multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy objective functions.An issue worth investigating is the influence of the K.K.T. coefficients (see Theorem 4.1) on the LU-Pareto optimal solution of (P2).To this end , one may explore the well known Implicit Theorem (see e.g. [5]) to express x∗ as a function of λ∗ and μ∗.Case studies should also be carried out, in a way to make transition from theory to practice in this setting.Another line for further development consists of extending the approach described here to situations where randomness and fuzzines are under one roof in an optimization framework see e.g [26,30,38].Finally we believe that Decision makers would best be served if from a deep comparative analysis between main fuzzy multiobjective programming methods,a user-friendly Decision Support System (DSS) could be pushed forward. Such a DSS would be of great help advising a Decision maker with the choice of the most suitable method for his problem [18].
