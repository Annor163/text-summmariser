@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a comparison study between the TLS-based security for DSMIPv6 and IKEv2 when establishing Security Associations between MN and HA. The network transmission and processing costs are examined for each protocol using different authentication methods. The results show that the TLS-based solution has less computation cost and less authentication delay than IKEv2with D–H Groups 5 and 14. However, the high amount of transmitted data for certificate based authentications increases the authentication delay in low bandwidth wireless networks.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Secure communications of mobility signaling protocols such as DSMIPv6 are critical to avoid a wide variety of threats like tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks [1]. The protocol of choice in DSMIPv6 specification is IPsec [2] with IKEv2 [3] to provide security for signaling and optionally for user traffic. IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining security associations. In the context of DSMIPv6, IKEv2 is used for performing mutual authentication, establishment and maintenance of SA between the MN and the HA and configuration of some MIPv6 parameters [4].The security aspect of the DSMIPv6 protocol is a critical component for consideration in terms of deployment and operation on large scales. While IPsec and IKEv2 enable a wide range of configurations and authentication possibilities they are rather complex. From the implementation point of view, the use of IKEv2 and IPsec for protecting MIPv6 traffic requires tight coupling between these two protocols on host's stack. Implementation experience has shown that the use of IKEv2 and IPsec with MIPv6 is fairly complex, and not always readily available in a specific platform at all. Therefore, the design of the (DS)MIPv6 security should be revised [5].To simplify implementations and make the mobility protocol easy to deploy without compromising security, a TLS-based framework was proposed by one of the authors and standardized on IETF in [6]. This framework is used for providing mutual authentication, security association establishment and management for DSMIPv6. Instead of using IKEv2, the proposed security framework is based on TLS protected messages for key exchange and for bootstrapping mobility related parameters between the MN and a new functional entity called HAC. The use of TLS is justified by its wide deployment on practically every possible platform that connects to Internet and Web services. Also, TLS implementations have high degree of maturity and the protocol is implemented entirely in the user space. The TLS security framework for DSMIPv6 will be referred as DSMIPv6-TLS in this paper.With two security methods for DSMIPv6 now standardized, it is important to assess the network and computational costs of each protocol. This paper presents a technical comparison between DSMIPv6-TLS and IKEv2 for DSMIPv6 authentication and SA establishment. Experimental measurements of network transmission and processing costs for each protocol using different authentication methods were conduced in a laboratory network setup. We considered both WiFi and UMTS access technologies. In DSMIPv6-TLS the HAC is authenticated using TLS with server and mutual certificate based authentication. The authentication of the MN is done using either EAP or PSK inside the newly created TLS tunnel. In this paper we only concentrate on the EAP-MD5-based MN authentication. For IKEv2 the studied methods are PSK, EAP-MD5 and public key security using RSA with X.509 Certificates.The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the TLS-based security framework and the IKEv2 operation with DSMIPv6. Section 3 presents the protocols and technologies, the terminology used as well as the reference scenario. Section 4 describes the experimental setup and different measurement scenarios. Section 5 describes the obtained results. Section 6 concludes this work with the discussions about the obtained results.
