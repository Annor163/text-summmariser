@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The theory of aggregation most often deals with measures of central tendency. However, sometimes a very different kind of a numeric vector’s synthesis into a single number is required. In this paper we introduce a class of mathematical functions which aim to measure spread or scatter of one-dimensional quantitative data. The proposed definition serves as a common, abstract framework for measures of absolute spread known from statistics, exploratory data analysis and data mining, e.g. the sample variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range (IQR), median absolute deviation (MAD), etc. Additionally, we develop new measures of experts’ opinions diversity or consensus in group decision making problems. We investigate some properties of spread measures, show how are they related to aggregation functions, and indicate their new potentially fruitful application areas.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many introductory textbooks on applied statistics (or academic lectures on the subject) include a review of the so-called descriptive statistics, i.e. methods for summarizing quantitative data. Most often such methods are divided into at least two classes (cf. Aczel, 1996, Chap. 1 and e.g. Cramér, 1946):1.measures of central tendency(also known as measures of location or centrality of observations); e.g. sample quantiles (including median, min, and max), arithmetic mean, mode, trimmed and winsorized mean etc.,measures of variability (or data spread), e.g. range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation.At the most general level, the process of combining multiple numeric values into a single, representative number is called aggregation. The theory of aggregation became a genuine, rapidly developing research field in the 1980s (see e.g. Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Calvo, Mayor, & Mesiar, 2002; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, & Pap, 2009; 2011a; 2011b). It may be observed, however, that the aggregation theory mainly focuses on the above-mentioned measures of central tendency, e.g. generalized means (OWA, OWMax operators, quasi-arithmetic means, etc.), averages, or “averaging functions”. Such a broad class of tools is characterized by the following widely accepted definition of an aggregation function (see Grabisch et al., 2009, Def. 1.1).Definition 1LetI=[a,b].A:In→Iis an aggregation function if at least:(a1)it is nondecreasing in each variable, i.e. for allx,x′∈Insuch that x ≤nx′, i.e. (∀i)xi≤xi′,it holdsA(x)≤A(x′),and fulfills the boundary conditions:(a2)infx∈InA(x)=infI,supx∈InA(x)=supI.It is true that these characteristic properties reflect somehow the concept of data synthesis: finding a value representative to the whole vector. Moreover, it is well-known that such functions are strongly connected to monotone (fuzzy) measures and integrals (cf. e.g. Greco, Mesiar, & Rindone, 2014).Aggregation functions have many successful applications, for example in multicriteria or group decision making, statistics, quality management, engineering, approximate reasoning, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic (cf. the notion of a t-norm and t-conorm, which are particular aggregation functions in [0, 1]2), etc.Example 1In a group decision making problem, assume that n decision makers express as x1, …, xn∈ [0, 1] the strength of preference toward an alternative. An aggregation function may be used to combine these assessments in order to obtain a global scoreA(x1,…,xn). For example, let n = 4 and x = (1, 1, 1, 0). If all the experts have the same standing, one may use e.g. the arithmetic mean to combine their opinions; in such a case we getA(x)=0.75. However, assume that the fourth decision maker is conceived as less competent (at least in a given matter) than the other ones, or his/her opinion has lower significance for some other reason (see e.g. Bernasconi, Choirat, & Seri, 2014; Saaty, 1994). If e.g. a weighting vector w = (2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7) describes the importance of the respective judges, then by calculating the weighted mean we getA′(x)=6/7≃0.86.It is evident that to understand the very nature of aggregation processes better, as well as to meet the practitioners’ needs, we should explore new classes of methods for summarizing quantitative data. And so, the second group of measures from the above classification of descriptive statistics consists of single numbers that quantify the broadly-conceived “variability” of mathematical objects. Let us investigate it more deeply.An important, yet not directly connected with our task, characterization of measures of entropy or uncertainty of discrete probability mass functions (represented by numeric vectors in [0, 1]nwith elements summing up to 1) was proposed by Martín, Mayor, and Suñer (2001). Such a class includes e.g. the Shannon entropy and alike, cf. also (Kostal, Lansky, and Pokora (2013)). Other very loosely related measures include the notion of fuzziness of a fuzzy set, cf. (Sanchez & Trillas, 2012; Weber, 1984; Zeng & Li, 2006), multidiscances (Martin & Mayor, 2011), or a probability distribution’s scale parameter estimates (non-negative, translation and ratio scale invariant functions discussed by Pitman, 1939).Among the aggregation methods of our concern, on the other hand, we may find:1.Measures of absolute data spread, e.g. standard deviation, IQR, MAD. In this case, an absolute spread measureVmay accompany an aggregation functionAin order to state that a numeric list x is concisely described asA(x)±V(x).Measures of relative data spread(e.g. Gini coefficient, coefficient of variation), which are dependent on the order of magnitude of a numeric list’s elements. For instance, imagine that we have two groups of people. The first group consists of (1, 2, 3)-year-olds and the second one of (101, 102, 103)-year-olds. Intuitively, the relative spread of age in the first group is greater than that of the second group.Most importantly, to our best knowledge none of these has been discussed from the point of view of aggregation theory. In particular, it is still unknown what characteristic properties link the measures within both groups. Note that even in statistics there are many functions which aim – at least theoretically – to be used for the mentioned purposes. Also, diverse application areas require treatment with different suitable measures. We strongly believe that the measures of absolute and relative spread are worth of deeper, separate studies. Hence, this contribution will focus on the first subclass.Example 1(cont’d).If all the experts are of the same esteem, we may use e.g. the sample standard deviation to assess the consistency of decision makers’ opinions, refer e.g. to Huang, Chang, and Lin (2013) for such an approach. However, if some form of weighting of the importance of opinions or their values is needed, then we should seek for a different kind of method for measuring the hetero/homogeneity. This, apart from measures of central tendency, could be an important, supplementary information on a numeric sequence, (cf. e.g. Ohki and Murofushi (2012)).The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we propose a binary preorder which is further on used to determine whether a vector has no larger absolute spread than another one. Basing on this notion, in Section 3 we introduce the notion of a spread measure and indicate some additional properties that may be useful in particular application areas. In Section 4 we prove that the spread measures are naturally connected to aggregation functions. In Section 5 we show that the well-known descriptive statistics, like sample variance, standard deviation, interquartile range, range, median absolute deviation, and mean difference, are consistent with our definition and develop some new classes of functions which are of particular usefulness in DM tasks. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and indicates many ideas worth of deeper further studies.Fixn∈Nand letI=[a,b],b > a. From now on for eachc∈Iwe denote by (n*c) a sequence(c,c,…,c)∈In. Additionally, we assume that [k] = {1, …, k} and that whenever at least one argument is a sequence, then all arithmetic operations are properly vectorized, e.g. we havex+x′=(x1+x1′,…,xn+xn′)and x + c = x + (n*c) = (x1 + c, …, xn+ c). In particular, Ind is a vectorized Boolean indicator function, i.e. Ind(c1, …, cn) = (v1, …, v1) with vi= 1 iff logical condition ciis true and 0 otherwise. What is more, let x(i), i ∈ [n], denote the ith smallest element inx∈In,S[n]denote the set of all permutations of [n], and for anyσ∈S[n],Iσn={(x1,…,xn)∈In:xσ(1)≤⋯≤xσ(n)}. Furthermore, ifF:In→I,then letF|σdenote the restriction ofFtoIσn,i.e.F|σ:Iσn→I,F|σ(x)=F(x)for anyx∈Iσn.Please note that the notion of ≤nplays a central role in the definition of aggregation functions. It is because an aggregation function is a morphism between the partially ordered space(In,≤n)and linearly ordered space(I,≤),cf. property (a1).In other words, if x ≤nx′, then we are certain that each aggregation function ranks x no higher than x′.We shall introduce the class of absolute spread measures in a similar manner. Let us pose a question: In which case does a given vector inInsurely have the same or not greater spread than another one inIn? Here is a list of the sine qua non postulates that seem reasonable for most applications.•Lowest possible spread. Any constant vector,(n*c),c∈Ishould have the lowest possible spread of all the vectors considered.Invariance to translations.Spread comparison results should not change when we translate all elements in at least one sequence considered, i.e. x and x + t are of the same spread for any x, t. Note that such a condition would be inappropriate in case of measures of relative spread.Non-symmetry.In statistics and data analysis, perhaps we will not take into account the relative ordering of the elements in a sequence: for anyσ′,σ′′∈S[n]the vectors(xσ′(1),…,xσ′(n))and(xσ′′(1),…,xσ′′(n))have the same spread, as we treat all the observations as just “points in the real line”; however, here we should be interested in a more general setting in which the relative ordering may be important: for example, each element in a vector may have a corresponding weight which is determined by its position (the ith element may be more “important” than the jth, cf. the above example).Moreover, how to modify a given vector x so that its spread surely does not decrease? A sensible answer may be given in terms of the notion of some kind of distance between all the pairs of elements. Namely, if the distance between each xiand xjdoes not decrease, then the spread also does not decrease. The most natural choice of the distance measure inIis of course an ℓp-norm generated one, d(xi, xj) = |xj− xi|. However, according to the non-symmetry postulate, we should rather insist on checking whether the signed distance between each pair of observations of the first vector is not greater than the distance between the corresponding pairs from the second one, cf. Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) for a well-known approach concerning increasing a spread of a probability distribution.The above intuitions are reflected by the following binary relation ≼nonIn. Givenx,x′∈In,we write x≼nx′ and say that xhas not greater absolute spread thanx′, if and only if for all i, j ∈ [n] it holds:(1)(xi−xj)(xi′−xj′)≥0and|xi−xj|≤|xi′−xj′|.Fig. 1illustrates two vectors: x and its modified version x′ with increased distances between consecutive elements.Example 2We have (0.0, 0.1, 0.3)≼n(0.0, 0.2, 0.6). Moreover, (0.0, 0.1, 0.3)≼n(0.2, 0.3, 0.5)≼n(0.0, 0.1, 0.3).Please note that ≼nis a preorder onIn,i.e. a relation that is reflexive and transitive. Firstly, let us study how ≼nbehaves under scaling and translation of elements in a given vector.Remark 2It is easily seen that for all s ≥ 1 andx∈Insuch thatsx=(sx1,…,sxn)∈Inwe have x≼nsx and of course1sx≼nx. Additionally, for allt∈Rfor whicht+x=(t+x1,…,t+xn)∈Init holds x≼nt + x and, at the same time, t + x≼nx. Thus, ≼nis not antisymmetric.What is more, it is easily seen that for allc∈I,(n*c) is a minimal element of(In,≼n),i.e. for any x we have (n*c)≼nx. This relation is also convex: for all x, x′, α ∈ [0, 1] it holds x≼nαx + (1 − α)x′≼nx′ whenever x≼nx′.Note that ifIis not a singleton, then also ≼nis not a total (complete) binary relation: there exist x, x′ such thatx¬≼nx′andx′¬≼nx. In other words, not all pairs of vectors are comparable with ≼n.Example 3It holds(0.0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0)¬≼n¬≽n(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0),where of course≽n=≼n−1. This fact conforms with the intuition: we cannot objectively (from all points of views) state which of the two vectors has greater spread: the second vector represents highly “polarized” observations, but in the two subgroups (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) the spread is the lowest possible (we may wish to give more weight to e.g. small observations). On the other hand, the observations in the first vector are all different. We see that, in general, our relation does not indicate whether we should look at a “global” or a “local” level, which is an advantage. A similar behavior is exhibited by ≤n, e.g. we have(0.5,0.5)¬≤n¬≥n(0,1).Additionally, whether ≼nholds for given x, x′ depends on how the elements in both vectors are jointly ordered. The left side of Eq. (1) implies that if x≼nx′, then x, x′ are comonotonic (cf. Grabisch et al., 2009, Def. 2.123). Thus, trivially, if x≼nx′, then there existsσ∈S[n]such thatx,x′∈Iσn. In fact, it might be shown that σ is an ordering permutation of x′.Example 1(cont’d).Our definition implies that(1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5)¬≼n¬≽n(0.6,1.0,1.0,1.0). When we treat the elements as just points in the real line, the second vector has not greater spread than the first one. However, in general we cannot compare them. Such a behavior of the ≼nrelation is especially useful in group decision making. Recall that in Example 1we had different confidence toward the competence of decision makers, and we should be really careful when judging whether they agree on a given topic or not. In our example, x4 is known to express a less faithful judgment. Thus, in (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5), the first three “faithful experts” totally agree and in (0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) they do not reach full consensus.Let us proceed with the definition of objects in which we have a special interest in this paper.Definition 3A spread measure is a mappingV:In→[0,∞]such that:(v1)for each x≼nx′ it holdsV(x)≤V(x′),for anyc∈Iit holdsV(n*c)=0.Note that the first characteristic property implies that each spread measure is translation invariant, i.e. we have:(v0)For anyx∈Inandt∈Rsuch thatx+t∈Init holdsV(t+x)=V(x).This property is fulfilled because (∀t, x)x≼nt + x and t + x≼nx (see Remark 2).On the other hand, the second characteristic property gives a kind of “normalization” of a spread measure’s output value: a constant vector has no spread at all. Of course, for n = 1, a spread measure always outputs the value 0, as a single number has “no spread”. Thus, we will always be interested in the case n ≥ 2. Also please note that for each function fulfilling (v1), by the fact that(∀c∈I)(n*c)≼nx, the second characteristic property is equivalent to requiring thatinfx∈InV(x)=0. We see that eachVis a morphism between the preordered space(In,≼n)and ([0, ∞], ≤), fulfilling the boundary condition (v2) concerning minima of(In,≼n).Note that there is no much sense in assuming thatVshould be a function ontoI,because of translation invariance. 0 is a good choice for the “lowest possible spread” as we will later see that some well-known measures of spread used in statistics do indeed output such a value for (n*c). On the other hand, in practice, when constructing a spread measure, one may wish to think of a kind of normalization ofVby providing some condition similar to the (a3) property, for example to impose that a spread measure in [0, 1]ngives values in [0, 1], or – more generally – in [0, b − a]. These requirements may be expressed by the conditions:(v3)supx∈InV(x)=b−a,orsupx∈InV(x)≤b−a,In this paper (v3) and (v3’) are not too important. This is because we have the following property (a similar result holds for aggregation functions).Remark 4Letsupx∈InV(x)=u. Then for each nondecreasing function φ: [0, u] → [0, (b − a)] such that φ(0) = 0, φ(u) = b − a, ifVis a spread measure, thenφ∘Vis a spread measure fulfilling (v3).Of course, in some cases one may impose additional conditions onV,like homogeneity of degree 1 (w.r.t. multiplication, also called ratio scale invariance, see Grabisch et al., 2009, Def. 2.86), cf. Remark 2:(v4)(∀x∈In)(∀s > 0) ifsx∈In,thenV(sx)=sV(x),or continuity (cf. Grabisch et al., 2009, Proposition 2.8):(v5)Vis continuous in each variable.(∀x∈In)V(x)=V(x(1),…,x(n)),and so on.Example 1(cont’d). Let x = (1, 1, 1, 0.5) and x′ = (0.5, 1, 1, 1) denote the opinions of four experts on two different matters and w = (2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7) be a weighting vector, i.e. the fourth expert is regarded as less competent than the others. The weighted means are equal to 13/14 and 12/14, respectively. The mean squared deviance from the weighted meanMSDw(y)=∑i=1n(yi−∑j=1nwiyi)2/4givesMSDw(x)=39/784andMSDw(x′)=37/784. However, by using a spread measureWD2WAMw,w(y)=∑i=1nwi(yi−∑j=1nwiyi)2(see Proposition 17), we obtainWD2WAMw,w(x)=3/98andWD2WAMw,w(x′)=5/98,which better agrees with our intuition.In Section 5 we will show that such functions as variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (among others) are indeed spread measures. Before that, however, we should study the relationship between spread measures and aggregation functions. Additionally, we are going to explore some basic properties of spread measures.For any givenx∈Inletdiff(x)=(x(2)−x(1),…,x(n)−x(n−1))denote the iterated difference between consecutive ordered components of a given vector. Please note that such a function is available in some statistical packages: for instance, it may be calculated by calling diff(sort(x)) in R(R Development Core Team, 2014). We see that ifδ=diff(x),then 0 ≤ δi≤ b − a and∑i=1n−1δi≤b−a. Intuitively, if x is already ordered, then this operation may be viewed as a kind of “vector differentiation”. On the other hand, forx˜=cumsum(x(1),δ)=(x(1),x(1)+δ1,x(1)+δ1+δ2,…,x(1)+δ1+⋯+δn)denoting the cumulative sum ofδ^=(x(1),δ)we havex(i)=x˜i,xi=x˜σ−1(i),where σ is such thatx∈Iσn. Thus, x may be reconstructed from x(1),δ, and σ.We are now in a position to provide an equivalent definition of the relation defined by Eq. (1).Lemma 5For anyx,x′∈Init holds x≼nx′ if and only if x, x′ are comonotonic anddiff(x)≤n−1diff(x′).(⟹) Trivial.(⟸) Take any comonotonic x, x′ and letσ∈S[n]be such thatx,x′∈Iσn. Also letδ:=diff(x)≤n−1diff(x′)=:δ′. Take any i, j such that xi≥ xj. Sinceδ≤n − 1δ′, it holdsxi−xj=x(1)+∑k=1σ−1(i)−1δk−x(1)−∑k=1σ−1(j)−1δk=∑k=σ−1(j)σ−1(i)−1δk≤∑k=σ−1(j)σ−1(i)−1δk′=xi′−xj′,with convention∑k=10⋯=0. Thus, x≼nx′, and the proof is complete.□LetX⊂Inbe a set such thatx,x′∈Xiffx(1)=x(1)′. Then for anyx,x′∈Xif x≼nx′, then there exist k ≥ 2, vectors y{1}, …, y{k} with y{1} = x and y{k} = x′, constants d1, …, dk> 0 andci,…,ck∈Isuch that y{i + 1} = y{i} + diInd(y{i} ≥ ci) for all i ∈ [k − 1]. Therefore, ifx,x′∈X,and x≼nx′, then x ≤nx′ (of course, the converse implication is not true in general).Lemma 5 implies that checking whether ≼nholds between a pair of vectors may be performed with an algorithm taking at most O(n log  n) time: it is a matter of finding an ordering permutation of x′ and some simple verifications taking linear time.We may now provide an alternative characterization of our class.Theorem 8V:In→[0,∞]is a spread measure if and only if(v1’)for each comonotonic x, x′ such thatdiff(x)≤n−1diff(x′)we haveV(x)≤V(x′),infx∈InV(x)=0.This result follows directly from Lemma 5 and the fact thatdiff(x)=(0,…,0)iff there exists c such that x = n*c. It becomes particularly appealing when we recall the definition of an aggregation function and compare the conditions (v1’) and (v2’) to (a1) and (a2). In fact, we have what follows.Corollary 9Any spread measureV:In→[0,∞]may be generated by a family of functions{A˜σ:σ∈S[n]},(∀σ∈S[n])A˜σ:[0,b−a]n−1→[0,∞]fulfills (a1) and (a2), and for all x and each σ, σ′ withx∈Iσnandx∈Iσ′nit holdsA˜σ(x)=A˜σ′(x). In such a setting,V(x)=A˜σ(diff(x))forx∈Iσn.Of course, ifVis symmetric, then we may restrict ourselves to the space of vectors that are already sorted. In such a case, only one generalized aggregation function is needed to generateV.Corollary 10For anyV:In→[0,∞],V|σfulfills (v1) and (v2) if and only if there existsA˜:[0,b−a]n−1→[0,∞]such thatV|σ(x)=A˜(diff(x))fulfills (a1) and (a2).Thus, we have established a beautiful connection between spread measures and aggregation functions.Additionally, note that ifV1,…,Vkare spread measures andA˜:[0,∞]k→[0,∞]fulfills (a1) and (a2), thenV′such thatV′(x)=A˜(V1(x),…,Vk(x))is also a spread measure.In this section we will provide an overview of descriptive statistics classically used in exploratory data analysis (all of them are symmetric), show that they are indeed spread measures according to our definition, and generalize them. This will lead to very interesting classes of functions that may be used e.g. in group decision making. Please note that an important step in most of the proofs below consists of rewritingV(x)in terms ofA˜(δ)withδ=diff(x). Such a reparametrization is also important from the perspective of aggregation functions theory, as it may indicate some new, not yet explored classes of central tendency measures.The first class of spread measures consists of sums of distances between all pairs of observations in a sample.Proposition 11A functionVdefined for any p ≥ 1 andx∈InasV(x)=∑i=1n∑k=1n|xi−xk|pis a continuous and symmetric spread measure.It is easily seen thatVis symmetric and fulfills (v2). Take any x and letδ=diff(x). Under the convention that∑i=10⋯=0we have:V(x)=2∑i=2n∑k=1i−1(x(i)−x(k))p=2∑i=2n∑k=1i−1(∑j=1i−1δj−∑j=1k−1δj)p=2∑i=2n∑k=1i−1(∑j=ki−1δj)p,which is a nondecreasing and continuous function w.r.t. each element inδ. Thus,Vis a spread measure.□Recall that for anyx∈Inand s ≥ 1 such thatsx∈Inwe have x≼nsx, see Remark 2. For any normalizing constant η > 0, a spread measure given byV(x)=(η∑i=1n∑k=1n|xi−xk|p)1/pfulfills (v4), i.e. is homogeneous of degree 1.Remark 12It might be shown that the sample variance,Var(x)=1n−1∑i=1n(xi−x¯)2,x¯=1n∑i=1nxi,may be expressed asVar(x)=12n(n−1)∑i=1n∑k=1n(xi−xk)2. As a consequence, it is a symmetric and continuous spread measure. In this case, assuming thatδ=diff(x),it holdsVar(x)=∑i=1n−1∑k=1n−1min{i(n−k),k(n−i)}n(n−1)δiδk. Moreover, by Remark 4, the standard deviationSD(x)=Var(x)is also a spread measure.We have∑i=1n∑k=1n(xi−xk)2=∑i=1n2(n−1)x(i)2−∑1≤i<j≤n4x(i)x(j). It might be shown that this formula is maximized e.g. at(⌊n2⌋*b,⌈n2⌉*a)which is then equal to2⌊n2⌋(n−⌊n2⌋)(b−a)2. Thus,V(x)=ηVar(x)fulfills (v1)–(v6) ifη=4n−1nfor even n andη=4nn+1otherwise.The above proposition also implies that the mean difference, defined asMD(x)=1n(n−1)∑i=1n∑k=1n|xi−xk|,is a symmetric spread measure. Here ifδ=diff(x),thenMD(x)=2∑i=1n−1i(n−i)n(n−1)δi.What is more, note thatMD(x)=2n(n−1)∑i=1n(2i−n−1)x(i). It is easily seen that it takes its maximal value e.g. at(⌊n2⌋*b,⌈n2⌉*a)which then is equal to2n(n−1)⌊n2⌋⌈n2⌉(b−a),i.e.n2(n−1)(b−a)≤(b−a)for even n and(n+1)2n(b−a)≤(b−a)otherwise. From this it follows thatMDfulfills (v3’). If we would like to require (v3) we may use these normalizing constants.Interestingly, it turns out that any aggregation function on a specific domain (e.g. the weighted mean, OWA, OWMax operators, etc.) may be used to generate a spread measure in a quite simple way – basing on the fact that each object of our interest is translation invariant. It is Corollary 6 which implies that for any aggregation functionA:[0,b−a]n→[0,b−a]a mappingV(x)=A(x1−x(1),…,xn−x(1))is a spread measure. For example, the sample range, given byRange(x)=x(n)−x(1),is included in this class.On the other hand, the class of spread measures is in some sense much richer: such a measure, after a proper translation of its inputs, is not necessarily nondecreasing in each variable. For example, let y = (0, 0, 1) and y′ = (0, 0.5, 1). We have y ≤ny′ andy¬≼n¬≽ny′. However,Var(y)=13>V(y′)=14,thusVardoes not fulfill (a1).Nevertheless, the following generalization ofA(x1−x(1),…,xn−x(1))might be interesting as it leads to a proof of the fact that another set of data analysis tools indeed consists of spread measures. Let us recall the notion of a sample quantile of order α ∈ [0, 1]. Although there are many various definitions in the literature and implementations in statistical software packages, see Hyndman and Fan (1996) for a review, it is generally accepted that such an aggregation function is an OWA operator (Yager, 1988) given by:Qα(x)=γx(k)+(1−γ)x(k+1),for some γ = γ(α, k) ∈ (0, 1] and k ∈ {⌊nα⌋, ⌊nα + 1⌋}. Also, three special cases should be included: withQ0being the sample minimum,Q1standing for sample maximum, andQ0.5being equivalent to the sample median,Med(x)=x((n+1)/2)for odd n, andMed(x)=0.5x(n/2)+0.5x(n/2+1)otherwise. Moreover, for each fixed x this should be a nondecreasing function of α.Let us consider the following class of functions, constructed by aggregating deviations from sample quantiles.Proposition 14For each α ∈ [0, 1] and any functionA˜:[0,(b−a)]n→[0,∞]fulfilling (a1) and (a2), the functionV:In→[0,∞]given by:(2)V(x)=A˜(|x1−Qα(x)|,…,|xn−Qα(x)|)is a spread measure.Let γ ∈ (0, 1] and 1 ≤ k < n be such that for all x we haveQα(x)=γx(k)+(1−γ)x(k+1). The functionVfulfills (v2), because for allc∈Iwe haveQα(n*c)=cand by (a2) it holdsV(n*c)=A˜(0,…,0)=0.Consider any σ andx∈Iσn. Letδ^=(x(1),diff(x))andy=(|x1−Qα(x)|,…,|xn−Qα(x)|). Recall that for all j ∈ [n] we havexj=∑l=1σ−1(j)δ^landx(j)=∑l=1jδ^l. Thus:yj=|xj−Qα(x)|=|∑l=1σ−1(j)δ^l−γ∑l=1kδ^l−(1−γ)∑l=1k+1δ^l|=|∑l=1σ−1(j)δ^l−∑l=1k+1δ^l+γδ^k+1|.AsV(x)=A˜(y),by nondecreasingness ofA˜it suffices to show that as elements inδ^increase, any yidoes not decrease. Indeed, we have:yj={∑l=σ−1(j)+1kδ^l+(1−γ)δ^k+1forσ−1(j)≤k,∑l=k+2σ−1(j)δ^l+γδ^k+1forσ−1(j)>k,and the proof is complete.□Of course, if we substitute each xjfor x( j) in Eq. (2) we immediately obtain a symmetric spread measure. Such a class includes the median absolute deviation, given by the equationMAD(x)=Med(|x−Med(x)|).What is more, a difference between sample quantilesV(x)=Qα′(x)−Qα′′(x)for any α′ ≥ α′′ is also included here. This is because ifV(x)=γ′x(k′)+(1−γ′)x(k′+1)−γ′′x(k′′)−(1−γ′′)x(k′′+1)for some γ′, γ′′, k′, k′′, k′′ < k′, thenV(x)may be expressed asγ′|x(k′)−Qα′′(x)|+(1−γ′)|x(k′+1)−Qα′′(x)|. Thus, by Proposition 14, it is a symmetric spread measure. Among the best known examples of such functions we find the interquartile range given byIQR(x)=Q0.75(x)−Q0.25(x)and of course the already mentioned sample range.Proposition 14 indicates some new, possibly interesting spread measures like∑i=1n(xi−Med(x))2(if we would like to use it in statistics, then of course we should normalize its value somehow) or e.g. a non-necessarily symmetric function∑i=1nwi|xi−Med(x)|,which can be of potential interest in DM problems.Additionally, note that as|sxi−Qα(sx)|=s|xi−Qα(x)|,Vis homogeneous of degree 1 if and only ifA˜fulfills (v4). For example, in the class of quasi-arithmetic meansA˜(x)=f−1(1n∑if(xi))only the geometric mean (∏ixi)1/nand root-mean-power(1n∑ixip)1/pmeets (v4), see Grabisch et al. (2009, Theorem 4.15 (ii)).Note that the functionA˜(x)=(∑i=1n1n|xi|p)1/pis symmetric, fulfills (a2), and is nondecreasing onIn. In this vector space it coincides with the Lp-norm || · ||p. Proposition 14 implies that, given the norm-generated metricdp,it holds thatdp(x,n*Qα(x))is a spread measure. Such a function has an intuitive interpretation: it denotes a distance to some sample quantile.In this section we will study functions which generalize spread measures of this type. First of all, we will substituteQαfor any weighted arithmetic mean (in the nonsymmetric case) or an OWA operator. Secondly, we will consider a weighted distance. We should note that, however, not all such functions fulfill (v1). For example, ifF(x)=∑i=150.2(xi−(0.5x1+0.5x5))2,thenF(0,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9)=0.2025andF(0,0.9,0.9,0.9,1)=0.196.Let w ∈ [0, 1]nbe a weighting vector, i.e. such that∑i=1nwi=1. Recall that the weighted arithmetic mean is given byWAMw(x)=∑i=1nwixi. It is an idempotent aggregation function ((∀c∈I)WAMw(n*c)=c), for which for anyx∈Inand s, t withsx+t∈Init holdsWAMw(sx+t)=sWAMw(x)+t.If we substitute xifor x(i) in the definition ofWAMw,then we obtain a symmetric aggregation functionOWAwcalled ordered weighted averaging operator, see Yager (1988).Definition 15Given p ≥ 1 and weighting vectors v, w, theWDpWAMv,woperator for p < ∞ is defined asWDpWAMv,w(x)=(∑i=1nvi|xi−WAMw(x)|p)1/p,and for p = ∞ as:WDpWAMv,w(x)=maxi=1,…,nvi|xi−WAMw(x)|.We immediately have thatWDpWAMoperators fulfill the following properties.Proposition 16For any p ≥ 1, and all weighting vectors v, w,WDpWAMv,wfulfills (v0), (v2), (v3’), and (v4).The elementary proof is omitted.In many practical cases we will often be interested in the p ∈ {1, 2, ∞} case with the setting vi= wi.MoreoverWDpOWAv,wmay be defined as symmetrized version ofWDpWAMv,w: in order to fulfill (v6) we substitute xifor x(i); of coursevi=wi=1ngivesWDpOWAv,w(x)=WDpWAMv,w(x). Note that ifOWAwdenotes a sample quantile, then we may make use of Proposition 14.In the following subsections we will examine when (v1) is fulfilled for p = 1, 2, ∞. Before that we shall provide the following auxiliary result. Fixσ∈S[n]and take anyx∈Iσn. Assuming thatδ=diff(x),we have:(3)WAMw|σ(x)=∑i=1nwσ(i)(xσ(1)+∑j=1i−1δj)=xσ(1)+∑i=2n(wσ(i)∑j=1i−1δj)=xσ(1)+∑i=1n−1(δi∑j=i+1nwσ(j))=xσ(1)+∑i=1n−1δiζiσ,withζiσ=∑j=i+1nwσ(j),i ∈ [n − 1]. Note thatζσ∈ [0, 1]n − 1 is nonincreasing and1−ζiσ=∑j=1iwσ(j).Let us begin with examining the p = 2 case. We have already noted that not all the functions of this kind fulfill (v1). In fact, we have what follows.Proposition 17Fixσ∈S[n],weighting vectors v, w, and letV(x)=∑i=1nvi(xi−∑j=1nwjxj)2. ThenV|σfulfills (v1) if and only if v and w are such that for all 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1 it holds:(∑i=b+1nvσ(i))(∑i=1awσ(i))+(∑i=1avσ(i))(∑i=b+1nwσ(i))≥(∑i=1awσ(i))(∑i=b+1nwσ(i)).Letx∈Iσnand assume thatδ:=diff(x). By Eq. (3) forζiσ=∑j=i+1nwσ(j),i ∈ [n − 1], we have:V|σ(x)=V|σ(δ)=vσ(1)(∑i=1n−1δiζiσ)2+∑i=1n−1vσ(i+1)(∑j=1iδj−∑j=1n−1δjζjσ)2.Temporarily, we may of course treatV|σas a function ofδ. We have to determine for which v, w the functionV|σis nondecreasing w.r.t. each element inδ. AsV|σis differentiable, we may examine all its partial derivatives. Assuming thatξiσ=∑j=i+1nvσ(j),i ∈ [n − 1], for any a ∈ [n − 1] it holds:12∂∂δaV|σ(δ)=vσ(1)ζaσ∑i=1n−1δiζiσ+∑i=1n−1vσ(i+1)(Ind(a≤i)−ζaσ)(∑j=1iδj−∑j=1n−1δjζjσ)=vσ(1)ζaσ∑i=1n−1δiζiσ+ζaσ∑i=1n−1vσ(i+1)∑j=1n−1δjζjσ−∑i=an−1vσ(i+1)∑j=1n−1δjζjσ−ζaσ∑i=1n−1vσ(i+1)∑j=1iδj+∑i=an−1vσ(i+1)∑j=1iδj=((ζaσ−ξaσ)∑i=1n−1δiζiσ)+(∑i=1n−1((ξaσ∧ξiσ)−ξiσζaσ)δi)=∑i=1n−1δi(ζiσζaσ−ζiσξaσ+ξaσ∧ξiσ−ξiσζaσ)=(*).We of course have to determine in which cases it holds∂V|σ/∂δa≥0for all a andδ. However, it is easily seen that it is necessary and sufficient to consider only the diff-vectors of the formδ= (0, …, 0, δb, 0, …, 0), i.e. with δb> 0, δi= 0, for all b, i = 1, …, n − 1 such that b ≠ i.Therefore, at this point of the proof we have already shown thatV|σis a spread measure if and only if for all a, b = 1, …, n − 1 it holds (*) ≥ 0. What is more, asξσis sorted nonincreasingly, we may note that the cases (a, b) = (i, j) and (a, b) = (j, i) are equivalent:(i)Ifa>b,then(*)=ξaσ(1−ζbσ)+ζaσ(ζbσ−ξbσ);(ii)Ifb<a,then(*)=ξbσ(1−ζaσ)+ζbσ(ζaσ−ξaσ).Additionally, for a = b the condition is always true:(*)=ζaσ2−2ξaσζaσ+ξaσ,as this is an upward-open parabola with discriminantΔ(ξaσ)=4ξaσ(ξaσ−1)≤0.Thus, we only have to check whetherξbδ(1−ζaδ)+(ζaδ−ξaδ)ζbδ≥0is true for 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1.Now let us rewrite the conditions so that they directly depend on v and w rather thanξδandζδ, respectively:ξbσ(1−ζaσ)−ξaσζbσ≥−ζaσζbσξbσ(1−ζaσ)−ξaσζbσ+ζbσ≥−ζaσζbσ+ζbσξbσ(1−ζaσ)+(1−ξaσ)ζbσ≥(1−ζaσ)ζbσ(∑i=b+1nvσ(i))(∑i=1awσ(i))+(∑i=1avσ(i))(∑i=b+1nwσ(i))≥(∑i=1awσ(i))(∑i=b+1nwσ(i)).Thus, the proof is complete.□Of course, in case of symmetricWD2OWAv,wspread measures we should examine if the conditions mentioned in Proposition 17 hold only in the case σ(i) = i. For nonsymmetric ones, unfortunately, we should consider each possible permutation σ. However, it is easily seen that if vi= wifor all i ∈ [n], thenV|σfulfills (v1) for everyσ∈S[n]. Thus, eachWD2WAMw,wis a spread measure. For example, after a proper transformation ofWD2WAMw,win case ofvi=wi=1nwe again obtain the standard deviation and sample variance.Furthermore, let us consider the p = 1 case. We should note that not allWD1WAMoperators fulfill (v1).Example 4LetV(x)=∑i=1n0.2|xi−(0.5x1+0.5x5)|. We haveV(0,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9)=0.45>V(0,0.9,0.9,0.9,1)=0.44.TheWD1WAMoperators that fulfill (v1) are characterized in the following proposition.Proposition 18Fixσ∈S[n],weighting vectors v, w, and letV(x)=∑i=1nvi|xi−∑j=1nwixj|. TheV|σfulfills (v1) if and only if v, w are such that for all r, k ∈ [n − 1] it holds∑i=1rwσ(i)(∑i=1kvσ(i)−∑i=k+1nvσ(i))≤∑i=1rvσ(i)forr<k,∑i=r+1nwσ(i)(∑i=k+1nvσ(i)−∑i=1kvσ(i))≤∑i=r+1nvσ(i)forr≥k.Letx∈Iσnandδ:=diff(x). Assuming thatζiσ=∑j=i+1nwσ(j)andξiσ=∑j=i+1nvσ(j),i ∈ [n − 1], letk=min{k∈[n−1]:∑i=1kδi−∑i=1n−1δiζiσ≥0}. By Eq. (3) we have:V|σ(x)=V|σ(δ)=vσ(1)|∑i=1n−1δiζiσ|+∑i=1n−1vσ(i+1)|∑j=1iδj−∑j=1n−1δjζjσ|=vσ(1)∑i=1n−1δiζiσ+∑i=1k−1vσ(i+1)(∑j=1n−1δjζjσ−∑j=1iδj)+∑i=kn−1vσ(i+1)(∑j=1iδj−∑j=1n−1δjζjσ)=(1−ξkσ)∑i=1n−1δiζiσ−ξkσ∑i=1n−1δiζiσ−∑i=1k−1(ξiσ−ξkσ)δi+∑i=kn−1ξiσδi+∑i=1k−1ξkσδi=∑i=1n−1((1−2ξkσ)ζiσ+Ind(i<k)(2ξkσ−ξiσ)+Ind(i≥k)ξiσ)δi.We shall find out for whichζσ,ξσit holdsV|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)≥0for any r ∈ [n − 1] and Δ > 0, whereδ′ = (δ1, …, δr − 1, δr+ Δ, δr + 1, …, δn − 1). Assuming thatk′=min{k′∈[n−1]:∑i=1k′δi′−∑i=1n−1δi′ζiσ≥0},let us consider three cases.(i)If k′ = k, then we have:V|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)=((1−2ξkσ)ζrσ+Ind(r<k)(2ξkσ−ξrσ)+Ind(r≥k)ξrσ)Δ.First of all, we should note that for eachζσand k there always existsδsuch that for someδ′ it holds k′ = k. Therefore,V|σin order to fulfill (v1) must necessarily be generated byζσandξσsuch that:(1−2ξkσ)ζrσ+2ξkσ−ξrσ≥0ifr<k,(1−2ξkσ)ζrσ+ξrσ≥0ifr≥k.for all r, k ∈ [n − 1]. The condition for r < k is equivalent to:(1−2ξkσ)ζrσ+2ξkσ−ξrσ≥0(1−2ξkσ)ζrσ−(1−2ξkσ)+(1−ξrσ)≥0(1−ζrσ)(1−2ξkσ)≤(1−ξrσ)∑i=1rwσ(i)(∑i=1kvσ(i)−∑i=k+1nvσ(i))≤∑i=1rvσ(i),and the second condition to:(1−2ξkσ)ζrσ+ξrσ≥0∑i=r+1nwσ(i)(∑i=k+1nvσ(i)−∑i=1kvσ(i))≤∑i=r+1nvσ(i).Now we shall examine the case k′ > k. Let us assume that conditions derived in case (i) hold. Note that we haveWAMw(x′)−WAMw(x)=ζrσΔ,wherexi′=xi+Ind(i≥r)Δ. By the definition of k′ and k it holdsxσ(k′)−WAMw(x)≥0andxσ(k′)+Ind(r<k′)Δ−WAMw(x)−ζrσΔ<0. Thus, it must necessarily hold that r ≥ k′ and−ζrσΔ<WAMw(x)−xσ(k′)≤0.V|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)−(Ind(r<k′)(2ξk′σ−ξrσ)+Ind(r≥k′)ξrσ)Δ=(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+(2ξkσ−2ξk′σ)∑i=1n−1ζiσδi−∑i=1k−1(2ξkσ−2ξk′σ)δi−∑i=kk′−1(2ξiσ−2ξk′σ)δi≥(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+2(ξkσ−ξk′σ)(∑i=1n−1δiζiσ−∑i=αk′−1δi)=(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+2(ξkσ−ξk′σ)(WAMw(x)−xσ(k′))≥(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ−2(ξkσ−ξk′σ)ζrσΔ=(1−2ξkσ)ζrσΔ.As r ≥ k′, it holdsV|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)≥(1−2ξkσ)ζrσΔ+ξrσΔ≥0. We see that the necessary conditions derived in case (i) are sufficient in case (ii).In the third case we assume that k′ < k. Here we surely have r ≤ k′, as∑i=1k′δi−∑i=1n−1ζiσδi<0and∑i=1k′δi+Ind(r≤k′)Δ−∑i=1n−1ζiσδi−ζrσΔ≥0.V|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)−(Ind(r<k′)(2ξk′σ−ξrσ)+Ind(r≥k′)ξrσ)Δ=(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+(2ξkσ−2ξk′σ)∑i=1n−1ζiσδi−∑i=1k′−1(2ξkσ−2ξk′σ)δi−∑i=k′k−1(2ξkσ−2ξiσ)δi=(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+(2ξk′σ−2ξkσ)(∑i=1k−1δi−∑i=1n−1ζiσδi)+∑i=k′k−1(2ξk′σ−2ξiσ)δi≥(1−2ξk′σ)ζrσΔ+(2ξk′σ−2ξkσ)(ζrσ−1)Δ+(2ξk′σ−2ξkσ)(∑i=1k−1δi+Δ−∑i=1n−1ζiσδi−ζrσ)≥(1−2ξkσ)ζrσΔ−(2ξk′σ−2ξkσ)Δ.As r ≤ k′ and for r = k′ it trivially holdsξrσ=2ξk′σ−ξrσ,we have:V|σ(δ′)−V|σ(δ)≥(1−2ξkσ)ζrσΔ−(2ξk′σ−2ξkσ)Δ+(2ξk′σ−ξrσ)Δ=(1−2ξkσ)ζrσΔ+(2ξkσ−ξrσ)Δ≥0.Thus, our necessary conditions are sufficient in all cases.□Please be noticed that if vi= wifor all i ∈ [n], then the conditions in the above theorem are fulfilled for any σ. Thus, for all w theWD1WAMw,woperator is a spread measure. For example, with this result we may imply that Fisher’s (1922)) mean error,ME(x)=1nπ2∑i=1n|xi−x¯|is a spread measure.In the p = ∞ case, v = w does not imply that (v1) hold.Example 5Let w = v = (0.2, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.05, 0.25), x = (0.12, 0.19, 0.77, 0.39, 0, 0.9), and x′ = (0.22, 0.29, 0.87, 0.49, 0, 1). We have x≼nx′, butWD∞WAM(x)v,w≃0.1028>WD∞WAM(x′)v,w≃0.1018.As here diverse values in v cause some interpretation difficulties, we will restrict ourselves to the case vi= 1/n.Proposition 19For anyσ∈S[n]and weighting vector w, letV(x)=maxi=1,…,n|xi−∑j=1nwjxj|. ThenV|σfulfills (v1).Letx∈Iσnandδ:=diff(x). Recalling how we have rewritten the definition ofWAMwin Eq. (3) we have:V|σ(x)=V|σ(δ)=∑i=1n−1δiζiσ∨⋁i=1n−1|∑j=1iδj−∑j=1n−1δjζjσ|=∑i=1n−1ζiσδi∨∑i=1n−1(1−ζiσ)δi.We see thatV|σis a nondecreasing function of elements inδ, thus it fulfills (v1).□In other words, this result implies that ifη=(n*1n),thenWD∞WAMη,wandWD∞OWAη,ware spread measures.
