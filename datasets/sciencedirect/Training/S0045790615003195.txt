@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Enhancing the throughput of cognitive radio network in the presence of malicious cognitive radio user (MCRU) is addressed in this paper. We have considered the impact of MCRU on the sensing performance and achievable throughput of secondary network during two phases, namely, sensing phase (SP) and secondary user transmission phase (SUTP), respectively. This impact is mitigated by employing cognitive radio (CR) users equipped with multiple receiving antennas. We have performed diversity combining and have formulated the optimization problems with solutions during SP and SUTP. Moreover, the method of estimating the channel between MCRU and CR receiver is integrated into the solution. Simulation results show that this method achieves 89% detection and 3.5 bits/s/Hz of achievable throughput, while maximal ratio combining technique offers only 22% and 0.4 bits/s/Hz, respectively, when MCRU is active with ten times stronger power than the primary user.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cognitive Radio (CR) resolves spectrum under-utilization problem in today’s wireless communication systems [1]. One of the intelligent modules of CR is spectrum sensing. Among many sensing algorithms reported so far, energy detection is the simplest, and relies not on the prior knowledge of primary users’s (PU’s) signal [2–4], and is employed in most of the reported works. Apart from energy detection, spectrum sensing is implemented through many other techniques namely, matched filter [5], cyclo-stationary based detection etc. [1,6,7].However, performance of spectrum sensing is degraded, if MCRU exists in a cognitive radio network (CRN). These MCRUs exist, for two reasons. Firstly, there could be a detection deficiency due to failure in the hardware part and/or malfunctioning of software algorithmic part of CR. Secondly, one or more CR users intentionally do malpractice by transmitting a signal similar to that of PU’s. In case of cooperative spectrum sensing, malicious activity is identified as reporting the combining center using bogus sensing data or sensing decision [8]. These MCRUs’ intention is to take advantage of available spectrum - whenever the primary user (PU) is absent - by confusing or defeating other CR users’ sensing algorithm [8,9].So far, many contributions have been made towards spectrum sensing, when MCRU exists in a CRN. The first work on PU emulation attack is found in [10], where the MCRU occupies the vacant channels of the licensed user by transmitting the signal similar to that of the PU’s so that access to the vacant channels by any other CR is denied.In the work reported by authors in [11], MCRU is modeled as an unreliable user, which transmits signal of similar nature to that of PU’s signal and defeats other CR users’ sensing algorithm. To avoid that, authors have proposed a localization-based defense scheme, which estimates location of the transmitter by observing its signal characteristics. Using those estimates, it verifies whether a received signal is that of a PU’s signal. An anti-primary-user-emulation attack is addressed in [12], where the secondary users (SUs) randomly choose channels to sense and avoid the attack of MCRU. The statistical nature of the signal of the attacker and his environment is assumed to be unknown to the SU. Further, to eliminate the problem of unknown environment, the technique of adversarial bandit problem is applied in the same work [12].In as much as spectrum sensing is vital to a CRN, achievable throughput of a secondary network is also equally important [13]. A trade-off between sensing and throughput has been reported in [13], where sensing is performed periodically in each frame followed by SU’s transmission. Authors in [14] have considered a number of MCRUs in a CRN, who report bogus sensing data to the combining center. Moreover, they have developed a scheme to detect them and minimize their interference during the data combining stage. But this work requires a priori knowledge of number of MCRUs that exist in a CRN. Hence the algorithm is not so successful in a situation, where MCRUs change their intention dynamically.Authors in [15] have reported a sensing methodology for PU detection in the presence of MCRU by exploiting cooperation between CR users. But that work suffers from two severe drawbacks. First, it demands a dedicated reporting channel to exist between every CR user and combining center, notwithstanding the fact that demanding such a channel is irrational when addressing the problem of spectrum under-utilization. Secondly, fusion center’s decision is based on the data sent from every CR user, which will include a few MCRUs, in a network. So, the received data itself is suspect. Finally, authors in [15], have dealt with sensing method, but they have not dealt with throughput of a secondary network which is paramount [13] and without it, the effort is inadequate. Notwithstanding these efforts, to improve the throughput of a CRN in a situation where MCRU is active, not much has been reported.In this paper, we take cognizance of the existence of MCRU during both sensing phase (SP) and secondary user’s transmission phase (SUTP), and present a method to alleviate its effect during both the phases. We employ CR user equipped with multiple receiving antennas [16] for diversity combining, so that we do not depend on cooperation between CR users, which demands a dedicated reporting channel. We have formulated the optimization problems with solution during SP and SUTP. Using this method, we have improved the sensing performance and achievable throughput of a secondary network, when MCRU coexists in a CRN. Moreover, by assuming the known channel-coefficients between PU and cognitive radio receiver (CRR), we have presented a scheme to estimate the channel between MCRU and CRR.Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the system model of the proposed work, followed by optimization problem during SP and channel estimation. Section 4 deals with achievable throughput and finding the optimal weights to increase the throughput. Simulation results are presented in Section 5 with discussions. Section 6 concludes the work.System model during SP and SUTP is shown in Figs. 1and 2, respectively. We consider the existence of one PU, and one MCRU in a CRN. We assume that PU transmits its signal of power Zp, and MCRU transmits a similar signal of power Mp. We consider that each CR transceiver is equipped with L receiving antennas [16]. Rayleigh fading, in particular, slow fading is assumed to exist between PU and each of the l receiving antennas of CRR, and between CR transmitter (CRT) and each of the l antennas of CRR, where l varies from 0 toL−1. Noise component in each antenna is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) complex gaussian random variable of mean zero and varianceσn2. In addition, PU’s signal, MCRU’s and noise are assumed to be mutually independent of each other. The combined-signal model of the received signal during both SP and SUTP, at CRR is given by,(1)rl(i)=αZphzlz(i)+δMphmlm(i)+β{Sphsls(i)+Mphnlm(i)}+nl(i)where i indicates time index varying from 0 toN−1,β=0indicates the signal received during SP,β=1,α=0andδ=0indicate the signal received during SUTP, hzldenotes channel between PU andlth antenna of CRR, hsldenotes channel between CRT andlth antenna of CRR, hmldenotes channel between MCRU andlth antenna of CRR during SP, and hnldenotes channel between MCRU andlth antenna of CRR during SUTP, nl(i) is spatio-temporal-uncorrelated noise of varianceσn2. The PU’s signal, z(i) in (1) is modelled as i.i.d complex gaussian random variable of zero mean and unit variance, and so is MCRU’s signal m(i), as it mimics PU’s. SoZpz(i)andMpm(i)will have the variance (power) of Zpand Mprespectively. Similarly, s(i) is modelled as complex gaussian random variable of zero mean and unit variance.During SP, that is, whenβ=0,given a weight vectorw=[w0*w1*w2*⋯wL−1*]H,we let CRR perform linear combination of received signal vectorr=[r0*(i)r1*(i)r2*(i)⋯rL−1*(i)]Has(2)y(i)=wHrwhere the superscript H indicates hermitian transpose, and * indicates complex conjugation. It is to be noted that during SP, mean of y(i), i.e.E[y(i)/α=0,β=0,δ=1]=0,because,E[m(i)]=0and mean of nl(i) is also zero, where E(·) is an expectation operator. Similarly,E[y(i)/α=1,β=0,δ=1]is also 0, because mean of z(i) is zero. This implies that the mean ofy(i)=0,whether PU is present or not.We letΣ02to denote the variance of y(i), whenα=0,β=0andδ=1and the same is found as(3)Σ02=E[|y(i)|2/α=0,β=0,δ=1]=E[(wHr)(wHr)H]=E[wHrrHw]=E{wH[Mphmm(i)+nl(i)][Mphmm(i)+nl(i)]Hw}=Mp|wHhm|2+wHσn2wwherehm=[hm0*hm1*hm2*⋯hmL−1*]His the stacked channel coefficients of hmlin vector form. In the above equation, since m(i) and nl(i) are independent of each other, we have substitutedE[m(i)nl*(i)]=E[nl(i)m*(i)]=0.Similarly, whenα=1,β=0andδ=1,the variance becomesΣ12=Mp|wHhm|2+Zp|wHhz|2+wHσn2w,wherehm=[hm0*hm1*hm2*⋯hmL−1*]Handhz=[hz0*hz1*hz2*⋯hzL−1*]Hare the stacked channel coefficients of hmland hzlin vector form respectively.We adopt energy detection at CRR. The energy of the linearly combined signal y(i) is given byE=∑i=0N−1|y(i)|2,whereN=τfsis the number of samples, with the sampling frequency fs, over the sensing time τ. The probability distribution of E can be found using (2) and (3). To do so, we need to find mean and variance of E. Now, the mean of E is obtained asE(E|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=E(∑i=0N−1|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)where E(· | ·) is the conditional expectation operator. Further,(4)E(E|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=∑i=0N−1E(|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=NΣ02Similarly,(5)E(E|α=1,β=0,δ=1)=∑i=0N−1E(|y(i)|2|α=1,β=0,δ=1)=NΣ12It is known that |y(i)|’s are independent of each other. Therefore, variance of E is obtained as follows [17]ravar(E|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=ravar(∑i=0N−1|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)(6)ravar(E|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=∑i=0N−1ravar(|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)where var(a|b) is the conditional variance operator. In (6), first, we would like to find theravar(|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)inside the summation. For convenience, we omit the conditional parameters in (6). Therefore, we call the termravar(|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)simply as var(|y(i)|2), which givesravar(|y(i)|2)=E(|y(i)|4)−|E(|y(i)|2)|2=E(|y(i)|4)−Σ04Since y(i) is complex gaussian number, its real and imaginary parts are independent gaussian numbers of zero mean and each of varianceΣ022. Lety(i)=yr(i)+jyim(i),thenyr(i)∼N(0,Σ02/2)andyim(i)∼N(0,Σ02/2)are the distributions of real and imaginary parts of y(i). We can reduce further as,ravar(|y(i)|2)=E(∥yr(i)|2+|yim(i)|2|2)−Σo4ravar(|y(i)|2)=E(|yr(i)|4)+E(|yim(i)|4)+2E(|yr(i)|2|yim(i)|2)−Σ04ravar(|y(i)|2)=3Σ044+3Σ044+2Σ044−Σ04=Σ04Substituting the above result into (6), we get(7)ravar(|y(i)|2|α=0,β=0,δ=1)=NΣ04In similar way, we obtain(8)ravar(|y(i)|2|α=1,β=0,δ=1)=NΣ14According to central limit theorem (CLT), when large number of samples is considered, the distribution of E is assumed to be gaussian [9,13,17]. Incorporating CLT and (4), (5), (7) and (8), the distribution of E is given by,(9)E∼{N(NΣ02,NΣ04);α=0,β=0andδ=1N(NΣ12,NΣ14);α=1,β=0andδ=1whereN(μ,σ2)is gaussian distributed random variable of mean μ and variance σ2. Assume that the channel is slow fading and therefore constant over a frame. By letting λ as the threshold of detection, instantaneous probability of detection can be derived as,(10)Pd=Pr{E>λ|α=1,β=0,δ=1}=∫λ∞fE(ϵ∣α=1,β=0,δ=1)dϵwherefE(ϵ∣α=1,β=0,δ=1)denotes conditional probability density function of E, whenα=1,β=0,δ=1. From (9), this density is obtained asfE(ϵ∣α=1,β=0,δ=1)=12πNΣ14e−(ϵ−NΣ12)22NΣ14. Therefore(11)Pd=∫λ∞12πNΣ14e−(ϵ−NΣ12)22NΣ14dϵIf we letx=ϵ−NΣ12NΣ14in the above Eq. (11), we get(12)Pd=∫λ−NΣ12NΣ14∞12πe−x22dx=Q(λ−NΣ12NΣ12)whereQ(x)=∫x∞e−t22dtis aQ(·)function. Similarly, probability of false alarm can be found using (9) as,(13)Pf=Pr{E>λ|α=0,β=0,δ=1}=∫λ∞fE(ϵ∣α=0,β=0,δ=1)dϵ=Q(λ−NΣ02NΣ02)wherefE(ϵ∣α=0,β=0,δ=1)denotes conditional probability density function of E, whenα=0,β=0,δ=1. Since the channel varies frame by frame, probabilities in (12) and (13) must be averaged with respect to the density functionsfhz(hz)andfhm(hm). The average false alarm probability over all the frames is found as,Pf¯=∫−∞∞Pffhm(hm)dhm. Similarly, average detection probability is obtained asPd¯=∫−∞∞∫−∞∞Pdfhm(hm)fhz(hz)dhmdhz. Finding closed form expressions ofPf¯andPd¯becomes complex and non-tractable. However, we have found the average of Pfand Pdempirically in the simulations.The existence of MCRU does increase false alarm. Our objective, in this section, is to obtain an optimal weight vector for linear combination during SP, to minimize Pf, when MCRU exists, without compromising the detection performance. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem to get wopt, which minimizesPf¯,for a fixed averagePd¯. Substituting (12) into (13), we cast the optimization problem as,(14)MinimizeQ(NΣ12Q−1(Pd¯)+NΣ12−NΣ02NΣ02)Q(·)in (14) can be written as,Q(Q−1(Pd¯)Σ12Σ02+NΣ12Σ02−N),of which N, andPd¯are fixed. Hence, minimizing the objective function in (14) is equivalent to maximizingΣ12Σ02. Hence, we recast (14) as follows,(15)maximize{1+Zp|wHhz|2Mp|wHhm|2+wHσn2w}s.twHhz=1The constraint in (15) ensures that the power received at CRR is unaltered at Zp. Further, Eq. (15) can be written as{1+Zp|wHhz|2MpwHhmhmHw+wHσn2w},in which the denominator term of the ratio is interference power plus noise power, which in turn needs to be minimized with the constraint as follows,(16)minimizewH(MpHm+σn2I)ws.twHhz=1whereHm=hmhmH. To find the optimal weight wopt, lagrangian function of (16) is first found, then differentiated with respect to w and the resultant is equated to zero [18].The lagrangian function of (16) is given byL=wHCw+Ψ(wHhz−1),whereC=MpHm+σn2I,and Ψ is the lagrangian multiplier.Gradient ofLwith respect to w is found as,(17)∇wL=∂∂wwHCw+Ψ(wHhz−1)=wHC+ΨhzHBy equating the gradient in (17) to 0, we getΨhzH=−wHC,which implieswH=−ΨhzHC−1. By substituting this into the constraint of (16), the lagrangian multiplier is obtained asΨ=−1hzHC−1hz.We get the optimal weight vector woptby substituting Ψ intowHC+ΨhzH=0. The woptis found as,(18)wtaopt=(MpHm+σn2I)−1hzhzH(MpHm+σn2I)−1hzEq. (18) requires channel coefficients hmand hzbe known. Channel hzin (18) can be estimated through blind-estimation or by using pilot symbols transmitted by PU during training period. We present the technique to estimate hmin the following section.Estimation of hzcan be assisted by pilot symbols transmitted by PU. However, since MCRU intentionally degrades the system’s detection performance, estimation of hmwould be a challenge. Here, we present a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique adopted in [19] to estimate hm, by assuming that hzis known. We also assume that PU’s power Zpand pilot symbols are known at CRR. Further, we assume that the channel is a slow-varying one. Therefore in (1), during SP, the termZphzlz(i)is known at CRR, and the same can be subtracted on both sides of (1). This operation is equivalent to treating (1) for the caseα=0,δ=1andβ=0.Assuming that hmis slow-varying, its estimate is done once every W frames, before sensing starts. LetR=[r0r1r2⋯rN−1]∈CL×Nbe the stacking of rl(i), after subtractingZphzlz(i)from (1). Since, rl(i) is independent of one another, the density function of R can be obtained as,(19)fR(r)=∏n=0N−1e−(rnHP−1rn)πLdet(P)=e−tr(P−1aRRH)πLNdet(P)NwhereP=E[aRRH/α=0,δ=1,β=0]=MphmhmH+σn2INis the covariance matrix, tr(·) denotes trace and det(·) the determinant of a matrix. Moreover,det(P)is equal to(Mp∥h^m∥2+σn2)(σn2)(L−1). Then, the likelihood function of R is found by taking the natural logarithm of fR(r) and replacing hmbyh^mwhich is given by,F(R)=−tr(P−1aRRH)−LN(lnπ)−Nln(Mp∥h^m∥2+σn2)−N(L−1)lnσn2.Using matrix inversion lemma,P−1=σn−2IN−σn−2h^mh^mHσn2Mp+∥h^m∥2. SubstitutingP−1intoF(R),we get the likelihood function as,(20)F(R)=−tr{(σn−2IN−σn−2h^mh^mHσn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)aRRH}−NLlnπ−Nln(σn2(Mp∥h^m∥2σn2+1))−N(L−1)lnσn2=−tr(aRRH)σn2+tr(h^mh^mHaRRH)(σn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)σn2−NLlnπ−Nlnσn2−Nln(Mp∥h^m∥2σn2+1)−NLlnσn2+Nlnσn2=−tr(aRRH)σn2+∥h^mHR∥2(σn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)σn2−NLlnπ−Nln(Mp∥h^m∥2σn2+1)−NLlnσn2Differentiating the likelihood function in (20) with respect toh^mand equating to zero gives the required solution. By setting∂∂h^mF(R)=0and reducing, we get1NaRRHh^m=νh^m,which can be written asP^h^m=νh^m,whereP^=1NaRRHis the sample covariance matrix of R andν=−1(σn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)(ζ∥h^m∥2−κ),ζ=1(σn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)2σn2,κ=1(σn2Mp+∥h^m∥2)σn2. The equationP^h^m=νh^mindicates that the estimated channelh^mshould be one of the eigen vectors ofP^,which maximizes the likelihood function in (20). Henceh^mis identified as the eigen vector that corresponds to the maximum eigen value, which can be recast as,(21)P^h^m=νmaxh^mEq. (21) demands that just by finding the eigen vector ofP^,h^mis obtained. Thus, the process requires the receiver to subtractZphzlz(i)from rl(i). Then the resultant is formed as a matrix R, followed by computing the sample covariance matrix of R. Then the eigen vector corresponding to the maximum eigen value of sample covariance matrix is found.After SP, if availability of spectrum is sensed, CRT transmits using single antenna for the remainingT−τseconds, where T is total frame duration in seconds. SUTP is described in (1) withα=0,δ=0andβ=1and the same is shown in Fig. 2. During SUTP, given a weight vectorq=[q0*q1*q2*⋯qL−1*]H,the linear combination of the received signal vector is obtained using (2) as qHr. We now would like to find power contained in the signal received from CRT alone and also the power contained in the sum of MCRU’s interfering signal and noise. The power contained in the linear combination, when CRT alone transmits is equal to the variance of qHr, which is,(22)ravar(qHr|rl(i)=Sphsls(i))=E[|y(i)|2]=E[y(i)yH(i)]=E{[qHSps(i)hs][qHSps(i)hs]H}=E{Sp[qHs(i)hs][hsHs*(i)q]}=Sp|qHhs|2where var(a|b) is the conditional variance operator andhs=[hs0*hs1*hs3*⋯hsL−1*]His the stacked channel coefficient of hsland the same is unchanging over one frame. While deriving (22),E[s(i)s*(i)]=E[|s(i)|2]=1is applied.Likewise, interference plus noise power due to MCRU’s signal and noise is derived from (2) as,(23)ravar(qHr|rl(i)=Mphnlm(i)+nl(i))=E[qH[Mpm(i)hn+nl(i)][Mpm(i)hn+nl(i)]Hq]=E[qH[Mpm(i)hn+nl(i)][hnHm*(i)MP+nl*(i)]q]We know that m(i) and nl(i) are independent of one another, thereforeE[m(i)nl*(i)]and E[nl(i)m*(i)] in (23) are zero.(24)ravar(qHr|rl(i)=Mphnlm(i)+nl(i))=Mp|qHhn|2+qHσn2qwherehn=[hn0*hn1*hn3*⋯hnL−1*]His the stacked channel coefficient of hnl.Throughput is obtained by substituting the result of (22) and (24) into the equationlog2(1+SignalpowerInterferenceplusnoisepower),which in our case is given by(25)C=log2(1+ravar(qHr|rl(i)=Sphsls(i))ravar(qHr|rl(i)=Mphnlm(i)+nl(i)))However, throughput mentioned in (25) is not fully achieved, because, secondary user does not transmit always, rather it may do so during one of the two events, namely wrong identification of occupied spectrum, and correct identification of unused spectrum [13]. The former corresponds to miss-detection event and the latter corresponds to the event of no false alarm respectively. Transmission during miss-detection is unfair. So in our analysis, we only consider throughput which corresponds to the correct identification of unused spectrum. Hence, the average achievable-throughput over all the frames is derived as [13],(26)T=C×Pr({PUisidentifiedtobeidle},{PUisidle})T=log2(1+Sp|qHhs|2Mp|qHhn|2+qHσn2q)Pr(PUisidentifiedtobeidle|PUisidle)Pr(PUisidle)T=log2(1+Sp|qHhs|2Mp|qHhn|2+qHσn2q)(1−Pf¯)PH0wherePH0=1−PH1indicates probability that PU is idle,qHσn2qis the power due to linear combination of noise samples with weight vector q andHn=hnhnH.From (26), it is clear that throughput can be maximized by minimizing MCRU’s power plus noise power, ensuring that maximum power from secondary transmitter is received. Therefore, the optimization problem can be formulated as follows.(27)minimizeqH(MpHn+σn2I)qs.t.qHhs=1The optimization problem in (27) is similar in form to the one in (16). The lagrangian function of (27) is given byJ=qHDq+Φ(qHhs−1),whereD=MpHn+σn2I,and Φ is the lagrangian multiplier.Gradient ofJwith respect to q is found as,∇qJ=qHD+ΦhsH=0which givesΦhsH=−qHD⇒qH=−ΦhsHD−1.By substituting qH into the constraint of (27), we get(28)−ΦhsHD−1hs=1which givesΦ=−1hsHD−1hs. We get optimal weight vector qoptby back substituting Φ intoqHD+ΦhsH=0as follows,(29)qtHaopt(MpHn+σn2I)=hsHhsH(MpHn+σn2I)−1hsqtaopt=(MpHn+σn2I)−1hshsH(MpHn+σn2I)−1hswhere we have used the fact that(D−1)H=D−1. While evaluating (29), we assume that hsis known at CRR. (hscan be determined through blind-estimation or by using pilot symbols from secondary transmitter.) However, hnis unknown, and it needs to be estimated. Further, since the secondary transmitter’s power and pilot symbols are known,Sphsls(i)is subtracted from rl(i) of (1) and the resultant is stacked into a matrixZ∈CL×Nwhose sample covariance is found asP^=1NaZZH. Then the estimateh^nis obtained through the eigen vector that corresponds to the maximum eigen valueofP^We have used MATLAB (R2013a) to simulate the scenario. We have performed 1,00,000 Monte-Carlo runs to do the simulation. The signal of PU, i.e., z(i) is taken as complex gaussian random numbers of zero mean and unit variance so thatZpz(i)will have the variance of Zp. Since MCRU mimics PU’s signal, its signal m(i) is also modelled as complex gaussian random numbers of zero mean and unit variance.Channel between PU and CRR is a slow rayleigh fading channel, therefore hzlis unchanging over a frame and so is hml. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between PU and lth antenna of CRR is defined asγl=Zp|hzl|2σn2,while γ is the average SNR. It is to be noted that γlis exponentially distributed, when hzlis a complex gaussian random number of zero mean. In addition, it is assumed that γlis same as average SNR γ over the Monte-Carlo runs. Therefore, the variance of hzlis set asγσn2Zp. We have setT=100ms,fs=100kHz,Pf¯=0.1,Pd¯=0.9,σn2=1,Zp=1,L=2and 4. Emitting power of MCRU is found usingMp=ρZp. Noise samples are modelled as circularly symmetric complex gaussian random numbers of zero mean and varianceσn2=1.Detection performance of this algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. In this simulation, we have taken the sensing time asτ=2ms and 5 ms, which givesN=200and 500, respectively. From Fig. 3, we make the following observations. First, we are able to achieve about 15% of detection even whenγ=−20dB,τ=2ms, andL=2. Second, detection performance increases if τ and/or L increase, because, Pdis a function of N and Σ1. The theoretical computations are also plotted in Fig. 3, and verified that they conform to simulation results. Therefore, we present only the simulation results in the discussions to follow.In Fig. 4, we have shown the detection performance of our method and MRC scheme for various power levels of MCRU. The detection performance of MRC - when there is no MCRU - is juxtaposed in the same Fig. 4. We defineρ=MpZpto describe the MCRU’s attack during SP, meaning larger value of ρ denotes stronger attack. Number of antennas is chosen asL=4. Other parameters arefs=100kHz,τ=2ms,Pf¯=0.1,σn2=1,Zp=1. The values of ρ are taken as 0.1, 10, and 50. Value ofρ=0.1indicates minimum power of MCRU and therefore weaker attack, whereasρ=50indicates the stronger one. Transmitting power of MCRU is found usingMp=ρZp. The SNR γ is set to vary from−20 dB to 0 dB. MRC finds the optimal weight vector using conj(hz), where conj(·) is the complex conjugation operator. In Fig. 4, MRC records the best detection performance, when there is no MCRU in the network. It is observed that the detection performance of our scheme whenρ=0.1is quite close to that of MRC’s. But when ρ increases, performance of MRC starts degrading, whereas our scheme does not compromise its detection. This fact can be verified from Fig. 4 that Pdis not compromised even whenρ=10for which MRC compromises and the degradation is severe whenρ=50. For instance, at an SNR of−10 dB, whenρ=10,MRC offers only 22% detection, whereas our method achieves 89%. Similarly, superiority of our method can be observed whenρ=50. In this case, at an SNR of−10 dB, our method achieves same 89% detection, but, MRC achieves only 14%. It is also to be noted that detection performance of proposed method is identical whenρ=10orρ=50,and is superior to MRC’s, which means increase in ρ does not diminish the detection performance of our scheme.Detection performance of our scheme for various L and Zpis plotted in Fig. 5. In this simulation, we have chosen the set of L values as 2, 4 and 8. The values of Zpare chosen as 1, 2 and 4. The curve of detection performance of MRC, whenL=8andZp=4is plotted as a reference, which sets an upper bound. The value of ρ is set as 10. Other parameters arefs=100kHz,τ=2ms,Pf¯=0.1,andσn2=1. We observe from this Fig. 5 that increase in L value, increases the detection probability, because Pdis a function of Σ1, which depend on L. But increase in Zpwill not make any improvement in detection performance, because SNR is fixed at a particular value, which is unaltered, even when Zpchanges. This is clearly seen if we observe the curves “ProposedL=2,Zp=1” and “ProposedL=2,Zp=2”, which are one and the same and there is no improvement due to increase in Zp. The Pdcurve of MRC assuming no MCRU whenL=8andZp=4is also sketched in Fig. 5 as a reference. This curve sets an upper bound to all other curves.The plot of mean-squared-error (MSE) between hmandh^mis shown in Fig. 6with respect to N. We have set N varying from 10 to 500 in steps of 10. The parameters used in this simulation areZp=1,σn2=1,ρ=10andL=4. For convenience sake, we have found MSE of the channel, which exist between MCRU and any one of the L antennas of CRR. For instance, in this plot, we have found MSE between hm1 and its estimateh^m1. In fact, the plot of MSE between any hmland its estimateh^mlwill be identical to the one shown in Fig. 6. Further, this plot includes the curves that correspond to unique values of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), which is defined as the ratioZp|hzl|2Mp|hml|2+σn2. One of the observations we make from Fig. 6 is this: when N increases, MSE decreases, because, increasing the sample size brings the sample-covariance-matrixP^,close to P. Therefore, its eigen vector is too close to hm.We name the curves in Fig. 6 as “SINR = 5 dB”, “SINR = 0 dB” and “SINR =−2 dB” corresponding to the SINR values of 5 dB, 0 dB and−2 dB, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 6 that the deviation between the curves “SINR = 5 dB”, “SINR = 0 dB” and “SINR =−2 dB” is very small. This shows that estimation is not affected by the transmitted power level of MCRU. For instance, the value of SINR =−2 dB indicates stronger power level of MCRU than that of SINR = 5 dB. But the corresponding deviation between the curves “SINR =−2 dB” and “SINR = 5 dB” is very small. Therefore, we conclude that the estimation is robust against the power level of MCRUs transmitter. We have not included the separate results of channel estimation during SUTP, as the discussions will be similar to the one we have presented here.Throughput achieved by this method is compared with that of MRC in Fig. 7. We define SNR between CRT and CRR asγs=Sp|hsl|2σn2. In simulating the scenario of Fig. 7, we have keptγ=−10dB,γs=10dB,L=4,T=100ms,fs=100kHz,σn2=1andPd¯=0.9. Moreover, we have assumed that the channel coefficients are known at the CRR. The probability that PU is present is assumed as 0.2. Weight vector corresponding to MRC, during SUTP is found asqt−MRCaopt−MRC=conj(hs). In this case, we have letρ=0.01,1,10,andη=0.01,10,100to illustrate the impact of MCRU during SP and SUTP respectively. The larger value of ρ and η indicate stronger power of MCRU than PU and secondary transmitter respectively. The throughput curves of our scheme and MRC in Fig. 7 are sketched for various combinations of ρ and η namely,ρ=0.1,η=0.01,ρ=10,η=10,andρ=50,η=100. These combinations are denoted in the legend of Fig. 7 as *, # and $, respectively. We observe from this Fig. 7 that achievable throughput of our method is superior to MRC for each value of ρ and η. For instance, the maximum throughput achieved by our method whenρ=10andη=10is 3.5 bits/s/Hz, whereas the MRC scheme achieves only 0.4 bits/s/Hz when ρ and η are 10.Fig. 8depicts the impact of channel estimation technique discussed in Sections 3.2 and 4 on the achievable throughput. In this simulation, we have assumed that hzand hswere known at CRR as if they were estimated through some pilot-assisted or blind estimation techniques. We have then estimated the channels hmand hnand have plotted the achievable throughput in Fig. 8. Further, we assume that channels are slow-varying and therefore, remain unchanged for W frames, the value of W being taken as 10 here. Hence, the estimation is done once in every 10 frames periodically. Other parameters remain the same as required to simulate the curves in Fig. 7. We observe from Fig. 8 that achievable throughput using estimated channel coefficients is overlapping with that obtained using known channel coefficients. It is also evident from Fig. 8 that achievable throughput after channel estimation is not affected by the transmitted power level of MCRU. In other words, achievable throughput after estimation of channels hmand hnare not affected, whenρ=50andη=50(which means MCRU transmits a signal having 50 times stronger power than PU as well as CRT). This fact is verified in Fig. 8 from the consonance between the throughput curves, which are obtained using known channel coefficients and estimated channel coefficients.We would like to show the complexity analysis for the proposed method. Computation complexity includes the process of multiplication, addition, memory read and write. The process of multiplication and addition are put together as floating point operations (FLOPS), whereas memory read/write operations are put together as memory operations (MEMOPS). Complexity analysis during SP, for each operation of the algorithm is shown in Table 1.Of the 5 steps shown in Table 1, only first 2 steps are to be done every frame. Steps from 3 to 5 are to be executed once in W frames. Number of MEMOPS required in first two steps are≈2(L+N). Number of FLOPS required in first two steps are≈2(L+N). Number of MEMOPS required in steps 3, 4 and 5 are≈7L2+5L+2NL. Number of FLOPS required in steps 3, 4 and 5 are≈2L3+O(L3)+9L2+2L2N+3L.Considering the simulation parametersτ=5ms,fs=100kHz →N=τ×fs=500samples, 1000 frames,L=4andW=10,number of MEMOPS required is2×1000(L+N)+100(7L2+5L+2NL)≈1421200MEMOPS. Number of FLOPS required is2×1000(L+N)+100(2L3+O(L3)+9L2+2L2N+3L)≈2636400+O(L3)FLOPS.There are processors which are capable of performing operations of the order of Giga FLOPS per second. So 2636400 +O(L3)FLOPS may consume approximately 2.6 ms +O(L3)×1×10−9s. Including MEMOPS, processor time consumption might be a few milliseconds. When complexity analysis during SUTP is considered, step 2 of the Table 1 can be ignored.
