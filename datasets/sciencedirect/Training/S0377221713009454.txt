@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper is concerned with an algorithmic solution to the split common fixed point problem in Hilbert spaces. Our method can be regarded as a variant of the “viscosity approximation method”. Under very classical assumptions, we establish a strong convergence theorem with regard to involved operators belonging to the wide class of quasi-nonexpansive operators. In contrast with other related processes, our algorithm does not require any estimate of some spectral radius. The technique of analysis developed in this work is new and can be applied to many other fixed point iterations. Numerical experiments are also performed with regard to an inverse heat problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Throughout this paperH1andH2are real Hilbert spaces endowed with inner products and induced norms denoted by〈·,·〉and|·|, respectively, whileHrefers to as any of these spaces. The fixed point set of any self-mapping U onHis denoted byFix(U)≔{x∈H;Ux=x}. The purpose of this work is to revisit the numerical approach to a solution of the split common fixed point problem (introduced in Censor & Segal (2009)), which is written(1.1)findx∗∈Fix(T)such thatAx∗∈Fix(S),whereA:H1→H2is a (nonzero) bounded linear operator,T:H1→H1andS:H2→H2are general operators. Our study will be concerned with S and T belonging to the general class of quasi-nonexpansive operators (EQ), which includes commonly used classes such as firmly nonexpansive (EFN), nonexpansive (EN) and firmly quasi-nonexpansive (or directed,EFQ) operators; see Definition 1.1. Note that the classEQappears naturally when using subgradient projection operator techniques in solving convexly constrained problems (Yamada & Ogura, 2004; Yamada, Ogura, & Shirakawa, 2002; Yang & Zhao, 2006).The above formalism provides an unified framework for the study of many significant real-world problems. It is worth underlining that (1.1) can be regarded as a generalization of the so-called split feasibility problem (introduced in Censor & Elfving (1994)):(1.2)findx∗∈Q1such thatAx∗∈Q2,whereQ1andQ2are convex subsets ofH1andH2, respectively. Such models were successfully developed for instance in radiation therapy treatment planning, sensor networks, resolution enhancement and so on (Byrne, 2002; Censor, Bortfeld, Martin, & Trofimov, 2006; Censor, Chen, Combettes, Davidi, & Herman, 2011; Xu, 2010; Yang, 2004). Note that (1.2) is nothing but the special instance of (1.1) when takingT=PQ1andS=PQ2(the metric projections ontoQ1andQ2, respectively); see, e.g., Takahashi (2000) for more details on the metric projection. It can be also noticed that (1.1) encompasses other recently discussed inverse problems such as split variational inequalities (Censor, Gibali, & Reich, 2011) and split monotone inclusions (Moudafi, 2011).For convenience of the reader, we recall the definitions of quasi-nonexpansive operators and other classes of operators often encountered in fixed point theory.Definition 1.1Consider an operatorU:H→H:(d1)U belongs toEFN, the set of firmly nonexpansive mappings, if∀x,y∈H,|Ux-Uy|2⩽|x-y|2-|(x-y)-(Ux-Uy)|2;U belongs toEN, the set of nonexpansive mappings, if∀(x,y)∈H×H,|Ux-Uy|⩽|x-y|;U belongs toEFQ, the set of firmly quasi-nonexpansive (or directed) mappings, if∀(x,q)∈H×Fix(U),|Ux-q|2⩽|x-q|2-|x-Ux|2;U belongs toEQ, the set of quasi-nonexpansive mappings, if∀(x,q)∈H×Fix(U),|Ux-q|⩽|x-q|.Clearly, we observe thatEFN⊂EN⊂EQand thatEFN⊂EFQ⊂EQ. It is also well-known thatEFNincludes resolvents and projection operators, whileEFQcontains subgradient projection operators (Bauschke & Combettes, 2001; Byrne, 2004; Yang & Zhao, 2006).Let us recall that (1.1) was investigated for directed operators through the following algorithm (Censor & Segal, 2009):(1.3)xn+1=T∘(I-μA∗(I-S)A)xn,whereμis some positive value andA∗is the adjoint operator of A. Clearly this iteration has been inspired from the “CQ algorithm” (Byrne, 2002, 2004), which is nothing but the special instance of (1.3) whenT=PQ1andS=PQ2are metric projections. This latter algorithm was aimed at solving the split feasibility problem (1.2). The convergence of (1.3) and that of the CQ algorithm were first established in the finite dimensional setting, under the condition that the step-sizeμsatisfies(1.4)μ∈0,2|A∗A|,where|A∗A|isthespectralradiusoftheoperatorA∗A.Later on, further algorithmic solutions to (1.1), in general Hilbert spaces, were investigated for quasi-nonexpansive operators (even for more general demicontractive operators) through Mann-type variants of (1.3) (Moudafi, 2010, 2011). Only weak convergence results are established under a similar condition to (1.4) together with some classical demi-closedness property regarding the involved operators.Definition 1.2Given an operatorU:H→H, we say thatI-Uis demiclosed (Goebel & Kirk, 1990) if(zk)⊂H,zk⇀zweakly,(I-U)(zk)→0strongly⇒z∈Fix(U).The demiclosedness property is well-known to be satisfied for instance by certain continuous operators such as nonexpansive and more general strictly pseudocontractive ones (Browder & Petryshyn, 1967; Marino & Xu, 2007), but also by (possibly discontinuous) operators, not nonexpansive, but quasi-nonexpansive (Maingé, 2008, Lemma 4.6).Another approach to (1.1) was proposed in Byrne, Censor, Gibali, and Reich (2011) with regard to firmly nonexpansive operators S and T through the Halpern-type variant of algorithm (1.3) given by(1.5)xn+1=αnx0+(1-αn)T∘(I-μA∗(I-S)A)(xn),where(αn)is a slowly vanishing sequence, that is(αn)⊂(0,1],limn→∞αn=0and∑n⩾0αn=+∞. The strong convergence of the iterations given by (1.5) was also established under the additional requirement (1.4).To solve (1.1) relative to quasi-nonexpansive mappings S and T, Zhao and He have recently exploited a strategy similar to that used in Maingé (2010) (for the fixed point problem), by introducing relaxation parameters in their algorithm. More precisely, they proposed and studied the following “viscosity-like” iteration (see Zhao & He, 2012):(1.6)xn+1=αnCxn+(1-αn)Uwn(xn),whereUwncorresponds to a relaxed form of the operatorU=T∘(I+μA∗(S-I)A)(namelyUwn=(1-wn)I+wnU),μand(wn)being positive real numbers,C:H1→H1is a strict contraction and(αn)is a slowly vanishing sequence. The strong convergence of (1.6) was obtained under the additional conditions on the parameters:(1.7)μ∈0,1|A∗A|;0<liminfn→+∞wn⩽limsupn→+∞wn<1/2.Their results extend (to the split fixed point problem) that of Maingé (2010) regarding the fixed point problem, namely the special case whenH1=H2andS=I(so that U reduces to T).It turns out for convergence that all the above-mentioned fixed-point methods are based upon the knowledge of the spectral radius of the operatorA∗A. It is our purpose here to propose an alternative approach to solving the common fixed point problem (1.1). More precisely, we prove a strong convergent result regarding a variant of (1.6), under very classical conditions, together with a range of variable step-sizes that does not depend on|A∗A|. An important particular case of our less restrictive strategy is also considered, leading to Polyak-type algorithms (Polyak, 1987). Numerical experiments are also performed with regard to an inverse heat equation.Remark 1.3Let us emphasize that the techniques of analysis developed in this paper are different (regarding the asymptotic convergence part) from that of Zhao and He (2012). In particular, we implicitly extend the result of (at least) Maingé (2010) to the following wider and natural range of relaxation parameter(1.8)0<liminfn→+∞wn⩽limsupn→+∞wn<1.Our techniques of analysis can be also applied to algorithm (1.6) so as to extend its related strong convergence result to the range of parameter (1.8). However this is out of the scope of this paper and we pay attention to a slightly different method.Let us recall (see Definition 1.1) that the classEQof quasi-nonexpansive mappings includes the classEFQof firmly quasi-nonexpansive mappings. However, as can be noticed from the literature (related to (1.1)), the conditions on the parameters for convergence of algorithms such as (1.6) are somewhat different, when dealing either with element ofEQor with element ofEFQ. So, in order to state precise results regarding these two situations, we will use the concept of demicontractive mappings (see, e.g., Hicks & Kubicek, 1977; Maingé & Maruster, 2011; Maruster, 1997; Moudafi, 2010).Definition 2.1An operatorU:H→His calledη-demicontractive (for some real valueη∈(-∞,1)) if, for any(x,q)∈H×Fix(U), it satisfies(d1)|Ux-q|2⩽|x-q|2+η|x-Ux|2, or equivalently,〈x-Ux,x-q〉⩾(1/2)(1-η)|x-Ux|2.The equivalence between the two inequalities in Definition 2.1 can be seen from the following classical equality:(2.1)∀(u,v)∈H2,〈u,v〉=-(1/2)|u-v|2+(1/2)|u|2+(1/2)|v|2.Let us observe that Definition 2.1 is satisfied forU∈EQandU∈EFQ, withη=0andη=-1, respectively. It is then immediate that any quasi-nonexpansive or directed mappingU:H→His also(1-kU)-demicontractive, withkU=1andkU=2, respectively, namely(2.2)∀(x,q)∈H×Fix(U),〈x-Ux,x-q〉⩾(1/2)kU|x-Ux|2.It is worth underlying that our study could be extended to the class of demicontractive mappings. However, as discussed in Maingé (2010, Remark 1.2), any demicontractive mapping can be reduced to an element ofEQthat have the same fixed point set, by means of a simple relaxation process. Namely, ifU:H→Hisη-demicontractive, then the relaxed operatorTν=(1-ν)I+νUbelongs toEQandFix(Tν)=Fix(T), wheneverν∈(0,1-η]. So we restrict ourselves to solving (1.1) with quasi-nonexpansive operators T and S.From now on, when dealing with a quasi-nonexpansive operator U, we assume that U is(1-kU)-demicontractive, with the valuekU=1(e.g., when U is a subgradient projection operator), or withkU=2(e.g., when U is a metric projection). These considerations will be helpful for legibility, so as to provide results that can be compared with other related works (involving projections or more general operators).In order to compute a solution of (1.1) we focus on the sequence(xn)generated by the following variant of algorithms (1.5) and (1.6):(2.3a)Take(wn)⊂(0,+∞),(αn)⊂(0,1],andselectx0∈H1,(2.3b)vn=xn-βnA∗(I-S)Axn,(2.3c)xn+1=αnCvn+(1-αn)Twnvn,whereTwn≔(1-wn)I+wnT,C:H1→H1is often referred to as a “selecting operator”, while(βn)is some control sequence of nonnegative real numbers. Conditions on the operators:(C1)A:H1→H2is a (nonzero) bounded linear operator;T:H1→H1(resp.S:H2→H2) is(1-kT)-demicontractive (resp.(1-kS)-demicontractive), withkT=1, orkT=2if T belongs toEFQ(resp.kS=1, orkS=2if S belongs toEFQ);C:H1→H1is a strict contraction, i.e., there exists someρ∈[0,1)such that|Cx-Cy|⩽ρ|x-y|for all(x,y)∈H12;I-TandI-Sare demi-closed operators.(C5)(wn)⊂[wa,wb]for valueswaandwbsuch that0<wa⩽wb<kT;(αn)⊂(0,1],limn→∞αn=0,∑n⩾0αn=∞.In the special situation whenH1=H2,βn≡0, andwn≡1, we easily observe that (2.3) becomes the so-called viscosity approximation method, which formally consists of the sequence(xn)given by the iteration (Halpern, 1967; Lions, 1977; Moudafi, 2000; Wittman, 1992; Xu, 2004)(2.4)xn+1=αnCxn+(1-αn)Txn.The method (2.4) was first considered (for nonexpansive mappings) with regard to the special case whenC=u(u being any given element inH), in Halpern (1967) (foru=0) and in Lions (1977) (also see Wittman, 1992). Afterwards, the convergence of (2.4) in its general form was discussed by Moudafi (2000) (also see Suzuki (2007) and Xu (2004)) for nonexpansive mappings and by Maingé (2010) for (relaxed) quasi-nonexpansive mappings (also see Kraikaew & Saejung, 2012; Wongchang & Saejung, 2011, for related works). This procedure can be regarded as a regularization process which is intended to induce the convergence in norm of the iterations. Another advantage of this procedure is that it allows a particular fixed point of T to be selected.Let us stress that condition (C5) allows over-relaxation forT∈EFN(hencekT=2), namely the relaxation parameter(wn)can be chosen in the range(1,2). This procedure is supposed to speed up the convergence of some fixed point iterations (Rockafellar, 1976).Several possibilities are then considered (in the next section) regarding the choice of(βn).Roughly speaking, as can be noticed, algorithmic solutions to (1.1) under conditions (C1)–(C2) usually involve a (possibly constant) control sequence(βn)verifying(2.5)(βn)⊂[βa,βb]withβaandβbsuchthat0<βa⩽βb<kSγ,whereγ=|A∗A|-1.Instead of a choice such as (2.5), we adopt an alternative methodology involving the set of indexesJand the sequence(μn)defined by(2.6a)J={n∈N|(S-I)Axn≠0},(2.6b)μn=|(S-I)Axn|2|A∗(S-I)Axn|2,ifn∈J,μ,otherwise(μbeinganynonnegativevalue).Remark 2.6The value ofμdoes not influence the considered process. This parameter was introduced for the sake of clarity. Furthermore, we will see (from Lemma 4.2) that(μn)is well-defined and satisfies(2.7)μn⩾γ,forn∈J.Observe that (2.7) is obtained provided that (C1) holds, S is(1-kS)demicontractive for some positive valuekS(which is guaranteed by (C2)), and thatR(A)(the range of A) is such thatR(A)∩Fix(S)≠∅(which is satisfied whenever (1.1) has a nonempty solution set).Denoting the cardinal ofJbyCard(J), we establish a main (strong) convergence result (Theorem 3.1) relative to algorithm (2.3) with step-sizes(βn)verifying(2.8)βn∈(0,kSμn),forn∈J,together with the following condition(2.9)limn→+∞,n∈Jαnβn(kSμn-βn)=0,wheneverCard(J)=+∞.Remark 2.7Let us clarify that condition (2.9) should be understood in the sense thatlimn→+∞Θϕ(n)=0, withΘn=αnβn(kSμn-βn), for any increasing mappingϕ:N→J, whereNdenotes the set of integers.Clearly, condition (2.8) makes sense and it is more flexible than (2.5), in the sense that it provides a wider range of parameter for(βn). Numerical experiments also show that (2.5) is far from being optimal, since the value ofγcan be very small comparing with the values ofμnforn∈J(see Fig. 5). It is also obvious that (2.8) and (2.9) are satisfied by (2.5) wheneverαn→0(asn→+∞), sinceμn⩾γforn∈J(from Remark 2.6).Two consequences of Theorem 3.1 are also considered through Theorems 3.2 and 3.3.Specifically, Theorem 3.2 is concerned with the particular choice of Polyak-type step-sizes, usually involved in projected subgradient methods (Polyak, 1987) (also see Larsson, Patricksson, & Stromberg (1996) for a performance study), namelyβn=kS(1-∊n)μn, where(∊n)⊂(0,1). The sequence(∊n)is assumed to be such thatlimn→+∞αn∊n(1-∊n)=0.Remark 2.9For solving (1.2), Lopez, Martin-Marquez, Wang, and Xu (2012) have recently proved a strong convergence result regarding the special case of (2.3) whenwn≡1,T=PQ1,S=PQ2(hencekS=2),C=u(for someu∈H1), andβn=2(1-∊n)μn(Polyak-type step-sizes), with(∊n)⊂[∊a,∊b]for values∊aand∊bsuch that0<∊a⩽∊b<1. The requirements for Theorem 3.2 cover the conditions on(∊n)used in Lopez et al. (2012), as well as limiting cases in which∊n→0(asn→+∞).Theorem 3.3 deals with the limiting case of vanishing step-sizes, namelylimn→+∞βn=0together withlimn→+∞αn/βn=0. This strategy may give rise to slow convergent methods but seems to be interesting (from the theoretical viewpoint) with regard to forthcoming developments in optimization and fixed point theory.From now on, we denote byΩthe solution set of (1.1), and we make the following standing assumption(3.1)Ω={q∈H1;q∈Fix(T)andAq∈Fix(S)}≠∅.Remark 3.1Let us recall that the fixed point set of any quasi-nonexpansive mapping is closed and convex (see, e.g., Yamada & Ogura, 2004, Proposition 1; Itoh & Takahashi, 1978, Corollary 1). It is then immediately deduced thatΩis a closed and convex subset ofH1.Now, we establish the strong convergence of the iterates given by (2.3) to the unique elementx∗∈Ωverifying the variational inequality problem(3.2)∀v∈Ω,〈(I-C)x∗,v-x∗〉⩾0,which equivalently solves the fixed-point problem(3.3)x∗=(PΩ∘C)x∗,wherePΩdenotes the metric projection ontoΩ.Remark 3.2Observe that the operatorPΩ∘Cis a strict contraction (since the projectionPΩis nonexpansive). Consequently, existence and uniqueness ofx∗are clearly deduced from the Banach-Picard theorem (in light of the formulation (3.3)).Let(xn)be the sequence generated by(2.3)under conditions (C1)–(C6), together with values(βn)satisfying(3.4a)βn∈(0,kSμn),forn∈J,(3.4b)limn→+∞,n∈Jαnβn(kSμn-βn)=0,wheneverCard(J)=+∞,whereJand(μn)are given by(2.6a) and (2.6b), respectively, andCard(J)is the cardinal ofJ. Then(xn)converges strongly to the unique solutionx∗of(3.2).The proof of Theorem 3.1 will be given in Section 5.2.A first application of Theorem 3.1 is given below.Theorem 3.2Convergence with Polyak-type step-sizesLet(xn)be the sequence generated by(2.3)under conditions (C1)–(C6) and step-sizes(βn)such that(3.5)βn=kS(1-∊n)μn,where(μn)is given by(2.6b), and(∊n)⊂(0,1)satisfies(3.6)limn→+∞αn∊n(1-∊n)=0.Then(xn)converges strongly to the unique solutionx∗of(3.2).Condition (3.4a) is obviously satisfied by the particular valueβn=(1-∊n)kSμn. In this situation, condition (3.4b) becomeslimn→+∞,n∈JαnkSμn2∊n(1-∊n)=0, wheneverCard(J)=+∞, which is also satisfied, thanks to (3.6) andμn⩾γ(according to Remark 2.6). So, the desired conclusion follows straightforwardly from Theorem 3.1. □A second application of Theorem 3.1 is given below relative to the (limiting) case of vanishing sequences(βn). Note that such a procedure can be encountered for instance in projected subgradients methods (Albert, Iusem, & Solodov, 1998).Theorem 3.3Convergence with vanishing step-sizesLet(xn)be the sequence generated by(2.3)under conditions (C1)–(C6) and together with a sequence of positive numbers(βn)verifying(3.7)limn→+∞βn=0andlimn→+∞αnβn=0.Then(xn)converges strongly to the unique solutionx∗of(3.2).Recalling thatμn⩾γforn∈J(according to Remark 2.6), we observe that condition (3.4a) (involved in of Theorem 3.1) is obviously satisfied (for n large enough) wheneverβn→0, while condition (3.4b) can be easily reduced tolimn→+∞,n∈Jαnβn=0wheneverCard(J)=+∞, which is clearly satisfied by the second condition in (3.7). Then, the conclusion follows immediately from Theorem 3.1.□Note that conditions (C6) and (3.7) are satisfied for instance when takingαn=1/np1andβn=1/np2with positive exponentsp1∈(0,1]andp2∈(0,p1).In this section we give a series of preliminary results needed for the convergence analysis of algorithm (2.3). In particular, the following lemma puts out some of the main properties of the involved relaxation process.Lemma 4.1LetUw≔(1-w)I+wU, wherew∈[0,∞), and letU:H→Hbe(1-kU)demicontractive (for some nonnegative valuekU). Then the following statements are reached for any(x,q)∈H×Fix(U):(i1)〈x-Uwx,x-q〉⩾w(1/2)kU|x-Ux|2;|Uwx-q|2⩽|x-q|2-w(kU-w)|Ux-x|2.Note thatI-Uw=w(I-U), so we observe that (i1) is equivalent to its special instance whenw=1, which is obviously given by (2.2). The second inequality (i2) is deduced from|Uwx-q|2=|x-q|2-2w〈x-q,x-Ux〉+w2|Ux-x|2,together with (i1). □The next lemma reveals important properties of (2.3).Lemma 4.2LetA:H1→H2be a linear operator, letS:H2→H2be(1-kS)-demicontractive (for some positive valuekS), and suppose thatD=R(A)∩Fix(S)≠∅(whereR(A)denotes the range of A), namely(4.1)D≔{q∈H1;Aq∈Fix(S)}≠∅.Then the following inequality is reached, for any(x,q)∈H1×D,(4.2)〈A∗(I-S)Ax,x-q〉⩾(kS/2)|(I-S)Ax|2.So, given any real valueμ, the mappingΓ:H1→[0,+∞)formulated forx∈H1as(4.3)Γ(x)=|(I-S)Ax|2|A∗(I-S)Ax|2,if(I-S)Ax≠0,andΓ(x)=μ,otherwise,is well-defined. Moreover, for any(x,q)∈H1×D, and for any nonnegative valueβ, we have(4.4)|v-q|2⩽|x-q|2-β(kSΓ(x)-β)|A∗(I-S)Ax|2,wherev=x-βA∗(I-S)Ax. If A is further a bounded operator, then for anyx∈H1, it holds that(4.5)Γ(x)⩾|A∗A|-1,whenever(I-S)Ax≠0.LetB=A∗(I-S)Aand take(x,q)∈H1×D. We obviously have〈Bx,x-q〉=〈(I-S)Ax,Ax-Aq〉, hence by(I-S)Aq=0and using Lemma 4.1-(i1) we obtain (4.2), that is〈Bx,x-q〉⩾(kS/2)|(I-S)Ax|2. It is then easily seen from (4.2) that(I-S)Ax≠0yieldsBx≠0, hence, the mappingΓgiven by (4.3) is well-defined. Clearly, for anyx∈H1, and using (4.2) and the definition ofΓ, we therefore have(1/2)kSΓ(x)|Bx|2⩽〈Bx,x-q〉. So, given any nonnegative valueβ, we deduce that(4.6)(1/2)βkSΓ(x)|Bx|2⩽〈βBx,x-q〉.Furthermore, settingv=x-βBxand using (2.1), we obtain〈βBx,x-q〉=12(-|v-q|2+|βBx|2+|x-q|2).As a result, we observe that (4.6) is equivalent toβkSΓ(x)|Bx|2⩽-|v-q|2+|βBx|2+|x-q|2,which can be rewritten as (4.4). Now, according to the definition of B, we readily have|Bx|2=〈(I-S)Ax,AA∗(I-S)Ax〉, hence assuming that A is a bounded operator yields(4.7)|Bx|2⩽|AA∗|×|(I-S)Ax|2.Consequently, assuming that(I-S)Ax≠0yieldsBx≠0, and by using (4.7) together with the definition ofΓ(x), we are led toΓ(x)⩾1/|AA∗|, that is (4.5). □Remark 4.1Let us stress (according to Lemma 4.2) that forR(A)∩Fix(S)≠∅, the sequences(xn)and(vn)given by (2.3) satisfy(4.8)|vn-q|2⩽|xn-q|2-βn(kSμn-βn)|A∗(I-S)Axn|2,where q is any element ofR(A)∩Fix(S)and(μn)is the sequence defined in (2.6b), provided that S is(1-kS)-demicontractive (for some positive valuekS) and that(βn)⊂[0,∞).Now we establish the boundedness of the iterations given by algorithm (2.3).Lemma 4.3Let(xn)be the sequence generated by(2.3)with conditions (C2)–(C3), (C5), (3.1), and with some sequence (βn) such that(4.9)0⩽βn⩽kSμn.If the parameter(αn)satisfies(4.10)(αn)⊂0,11-ρ(whereρisgivenby(C3)),then(xn)is a bounded sequence verifying(4.11)∀n⩾0,|xn-q|⩽max|x0-q|,|Cq-q|1-ρ,where q is any element of the solution setΩdefined in(3.1). In particular, ifαn→0(asn→+∞), then(xn)remains a bounded sequence.Takingq∈Ωand using (2.3c), we have|xn+1-q|=|αn(Cvn-Cq)+αn(Cq-q)+(1-αn)(Twnvn-q)|.It follows immediately that(4.12)|xn+1-q|⩽αn|Cvn-Cq|+αn|Cq-q|+(1-αn)|Twnvn-q|.From Lemma 4.1-(i2), we have|Twnvn-q|⩽|vn-q|, as T is assumed to be(1-kT)-demicontractive (by (C2)) and as(wn)⊂[0,kT](by (C5)). It is also obvious that|Cvn-Cq|⩽ρ|vn-q|, for someρ∈[0,1)(thanks to (C3)). Combining these last two results with (4.12) amounts to(4.13)|xn+1-q|⩽[1-(1-ρ)αn]|vn-q|+αn|Cq-q|.Note thatΩ⊂R(A)∩Fix(S), hence, by Remark 4.1, and as it is assumed that S is(1-kS)-demicontractive (by (C2)), and that(βn)⊂[0,kSμn](by (4.9)), we get|vn-q|⩽|xn-q|.This latter result together with (4.13) amounts to(4.14)|xn+1-q|⩽[1-(1-ρ)αn]|xn-q|+αn|Cq-q|.Then, settingQn≔max|xn-q|,|Cq-q|1-ρ, we clearly have|xn+1-q|⩽Qn, provided that(αn)⊂[0,1/(1-ρ)]. It is easily checked thatQn+1⩽Qn, and soQn⩽Q0. This leads immediately to (4.11), so that(xn)is bounded. In particular, (4.10) is satisfied for n large enough, wheneverαn→0(asn→+∞), which again guarantees the boundedness of(xn). □A key result in our analysis is given by the following lemma. It can be found in Maingé and Maruster (2011) and its proof is given for the sake of completeness.Lemma 5.1Let{an}be a sequence of nonnegative number such that(5.1)an+1⩽(1-γn)an+γnrn,where{rn}⊂(-∞,∞)is bounded above and{γn}⊂[0,1]satisfies∑n⩾0γn=∞. Then it holds that(5.2)lim supn→∞an⩽lim supn→∞rn.Let p be any positive integer and setσp=supj⩾prj. Then by (5.1) and forn⩾pwe immediately havean+1-an+γn(an-σp)⩽0,hence denotingbn=an-σpwe equivalently obtainbn+1⩽(1-γn)bn, which by induction yields(5.3)bn+1⩽Πk=pn(1-γk)bp.Clearly, we deduce thatbn+1⩽|bp|, so that(bn)is bounded above and so is(an). Moreover, assuming that∑n⩾0γn=∞(hencelimn→∞Πk=pn(1-γk)=0), and passing to the limit asn→∞in (5.3), we getlimsupn→∞bn=lim supn→∞bn+1⩽0, which is equivalent tolim supn→∞an⩽σp, so thatp→∞yields (5.2). □Let us provide a classical inequality that will be useful for proving Theorem 3.1.Lemma 5.2For(u,v)∈H2and positive valuesαand∊we have(5.4)|αu+(1-α)v|2⩽α21+1∊2|u|2+(1-α)21+∊2|v|2.It is readily obtained that|αu+(1-α)v|2=α2|u|2+(1-α)2|v|2+2α∊u,∊(1-α)v.In addition, the inequality0⩽α∊u-∊(1-α)v2can be obviously rewritten asα∊u,∊(1-α)v⩽12α∊2|u|2+∊2(1-α)2|v|2.Then combining these latter two results yields (5.4). □Remark 5.1Let us stress that the proof of convergence proposed in this paper is different from the usual ones (see, e.g., Lopez et al., 2012; Maingé, 2010; Zhao & He, 2012). Our approach does not distinguish between whether the sequence generated by the method is Fejer-monotone of not. Our new approach is simpler and more elegant. The same technique of analysis can be applied to the many papers dealing with viscosity-like algorithms and demicontractive mappings.(A) Let us establish an a priori estimate on the iterations. From (2.3c), and settingF=I-C, we obviously have(5.5)xn+1-vn=-αnFvn-(1-αn)(vn-Twnvn),hence, givenq∈Ω, we deduce that(5.6)〈xn+1-vn,vn-q〉=-αn〈Fvn,vn-q〉-(1-αn)〈vn-Twnvn,vn-q〉.Moreover, from Lemma 4.1-(i1), by condition (C2), and noticing thatq∈Fix(T), we get〈vn-Twnvn,vn-q〉⩾kTwn2|vn-Tvn|2,which together with (5.6) entails that(5.7)〈xn+1-vn,vn-q〉⩽-αn〈Fvn,vn-q〉-kT(1-αn)wn2|vn-Tvn|2.Furthermore, settingΓn=(1/2)|xn-q|2and using (2.1), we have〈vn-xn+1,vn-q〉=-Γn+1+12|vn-q|2+12|vn-xn+1|2,so that (5.7) can be equivalently rewritten as(5.8)Γn+1-12|vn-q|2-12|xn+1-vn|2⩽-αn〈Fvn,vn-q〉-kT(1-αn)wn2|vn-Tvn|2.From(wn)⊂[wa,wb]with(wa,wb)∈(0,kT)2(by (C5)), we can choose some positive real number∊such that(5.9)0<∊<kTwb-1.By (5.5) and Lemma 5.2, and settingν1=1+1∊2andν2=1+∊2, we have|xn+1-vn|2⩽ν1αn2|Fvn|2+ν2(1-αn)2|Twnvn-vn|2.So noticing that|Twnvn-vn|2=wn2|Tvn-vn|2and by(1-αn)2⩽(1-αn)we obtain(5.10)|xn+1-vn|2⩽ν1αn2|Fvn|2+ν2(1-αn)wn2|Tvn-vn|2.Then, from (5.8) and (5.10), and settingξn=|vn-Tvn|2andδn=〈Fvn,vn-q〉, we are led toΓn+1-12|vn-q|2-ν1αn22|Fvn|2-ν2(1-αn)wn22ξn⩽-αnδn-kT(1-αn)wn2ξn,or equivalently,(5.11)Γn+1-12|vn-q|2+(1-αn)wn2(kT-wnν2)ξn⩽αnν1αn2|Fvn|2-δn.Let us setτ1=(wa/2)(kT-wbν2)andτ2=(1/2)ν1. Clearly, from (5.9) and recalling that0<wa⩽wn⩽wb<kT, we have0<τ1⩽(wn/2)(kT-wnν2). Therefore, from (5.11), we immediately obtain(5.12)Γn+1-12|vn-q|2+τ1(1-αn)ξn⩽αnαnτ2|Fvn|2-δn.Note thatδncan be rewritten asδn=〈Fvn-Fq,vn-q〉+〈Fq,vn-q〉, hence, in light of (C3), it is readily checked thatδn⩾(1-ρ)|vn-q|2+〈Fq,vn-q〉. This last result together with (5.12) amounts to(5.13)Γn+1+τ1(1-αn)ξn⩽(1-τ3αn)12|vn-q|2+αnαnτ2|Fvn|2-〈Fq,vn-q〉,whereτ3=2(1-ρ)is a positive constant. From Remark 4.1, we additionally have(5.14)|vn-q|2⩽|xn-q|2-βn(kSμn-βn)|A∗(I-S)Axn|2.As a consequence, by (5.13) and (5.14) we deduce that(5.15)Γn+1+τ1(1-αn)ξn⩽(1-τ3αn)Γn-12βn(kSμn-βn)|A∗(I-S)Axn|2+αnαnτ2|Fvn|2-〈Fq,vn-q〉.(B) Now, we prove the convergence of the iterations. In light of (5.15) withq=x∗(x∗being the unique solution of (3.2)), we readily have(5.16)Γn+1⩽(1-τ3αn)Γn-αnHn,Hnbeing the quantity defined by(5.17)Hn=τ1(1-αn)1αn|vn-Tvn|2+12βnαn(1-τ3αn)(kSμn-βn)×|A∗(I-S)Axn|2-αnτ2|Fvn|2+〈Fx∗,vn-x∗〉,whereτi(i=1,…,3) are positive constants,F=I-C,Γj=(1/2)|xj-x∗|2. Let us observe that(xn)is bounded (according to Lemma 4.3) and so is(vn)(in light of Remark 4.1). As a result,(|F(vn)|)is also bounded (thanks to (C3)). It can be furthermore noticed that the quantity(1-τ3αn)is nonnegative for n large enough, becauseαn→0asn→0(by (C6)), and that(kSμn-βn)×|A∗(I-S)Axn|2is also nonnegative, whenever(βn)satisfies condition (3.4a). Clearly, these estimates guarantee that(Hn)is bounded from below. It is then deduced by Lemma 5.1 together with (5.16) and∑nαn=∞that(5.18)lim supn→∞|xn-x∗|2⩽lim supn→∞(-Hn)=-lim infn→∞Hn.Soliminfn→∞Hnis a finite real number. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that the boundedness of(xn)and(vn)ensure the existence of some elementq∈H1and some subsequence(xnk)of(xn)such that(5.19)xnk⇀qweaklyinH1andlim infn→∞Hn=limk→∞Hnk.Then by definition ofHnand observing that(Hnk)is bounded (since it is convergent), we are led to the boundedness of the following two quantities:1αnk|vnk-Tvnk|2andβnkαnk|kSμnk-βnk|×|A∗(I-S)Axnk|2.Hence, recalling thatβn∈(0,kSμn)if(I-S)Axn≠0, we straightforwardly deduce that there exists a positive constantνsuch that(5.20a)|vnk-Tvnk|2⩽ναnk,(5.20b)|A∗(I-S)Axnk|2⩽ναnkβnk(kSμnk-βnk),if(I-S)Axnk≠0.On the one hand, by (5.20a) (withαn→0asn→∞), we clearly obtain(5.21)limk→+∞|vnk-Tvnk|=0.On the other hand, settingK={nk|k∈N,(I-S)Axnk≠0}, we discuss the following two cases regarding the cardinal ofK: eitherCard(K)<∞, hence|A∗(I-S)Axnk|=0for k large enough; orCard(K)=∞, hence, observing thatK⊂J,whereJ={n|(I-S)Axn≠0},we haveCard(J)=+∞, which by (3.4b) and (5.20b) amounts tolimk→+∞|A∗(I-S)Axnk|=0.It results from both the cases that(5.22)limk→+∞|A∗(I-S)Axnk|=0,which by Lemma 4.2 (inequality (4.2)) amounts to(5.23)limk→∞|(I-S)Axnk|=0.Note also thatAxnk⇀Aqweakly inH2becausexnk⇀qweakly inH1. Hence, by (5.23) and invoking the demiclosedness ofI-S, we deduce that(5.24)Aq∈Fix(S).Furthermore, by (5.22) and recalling thatvn=xn-βnA∗(I-S)Axnwe readily obtain|xnk-vnk|→0, which yields(5.25)vnk⇀qweaklyinH1.It is then immediate (by demiclosedness ofI-T) thatq∈Fix(T). So, by (5.24), we conclude thatq∈Ω. Now returning to (5.19) and the definition ofHngiven by (5.17), and using (5.25), we getlim infn→∞Hn=limk→∞Hnk⩾lim infk→∞〈Fx∗,vnk-x∗〉=〈Fx∗,q-x∗〉.As a result, byq∈Ωand (3.2) we deduce thatlim infn→∞Hn⩾〈Fx∗,q-x∗〉⩾0,which, by (5.18), implies thatlimsupn→∞|xn-x∗|2=0, and solimn→∞|xn-x∗|2=0, namelyxn→x∗strongly inH1(asn→+∞).As an interesting instance of Theorem 3.2 we give a result regarding special cases of split problems, when the projections onto the involved sets are not available, e.g.: find an element belonging to some setΩof the form(6.1)Ω≔{q∈H1;q∈Q1andAq∈Q2}≠∅,whereA:H1→H2is a (nonzero) bounded linear operator, and each setQk(k=1,2) is some nonempty closed and convex subset ofHkgiven by(6.2)Qk={x∈Hk:Φk(x)⩽0},whereΦkis a convex function onHk. We also pay some attention to the particular case of (6.2) whenQkis a collection ofrkhalf subspacesHk,i(i=1,…,rk), associated with some family(ak,i,bk,i)i=1,…,rk⊂Hk×R, namely(6.3a)Qk=⋂i=1,…,rkHk,i,(6.3b)whereHk,i={x∈Hk|lk,i(x)=〈ak,i,x〉+bk,i⩾0}.In this setting, (6.1) can be reformulated as a split common fixed point problem by means of subgradient projections and other appropriate types of operators.Remark 6.1Subgradient projection techniques occur for instance in signal and image processing as an alternative to projection methods (Bauschke & Combettes, 2001; Yamada & Ogura, 2004). Given a continuous convex functionΦ:H→R(Hbeing a real Hilbert space), we setlev⩽0(Φ)≔{x∈H|Φ(x)⩽0}≠∅. A subgradient projection relative toΦis a mappingT(Φ):H→Hof the form:(∀x∈H)T(Φ)(x)≔x-Φ(x)|Φ′(x)|2Φ′(x)ifΦ(x)>0,xotherwise,whereΦ′:H→His a selection of∂Φ:H→2H, the Fenchel subdifferential ofΦ, namelyΦ′(x)∈∂Φ(x)for allx∈H. It is easily checked thatT(Φ)belongs toEFQand thatFix(T(Φ))=lev⩽0(Φ). We also recall thatI-T(Φ)is demi-closed whenever∂Φis bounded (that is,∂Φmaps bounded sets to bounded sets) (Maingé, 2008, Lemma 4.6).Now we claim our result.Theorem 6.1Suppose thatΩis some nonempty set of the form(6.1), whereA:H1→H2is a (nonzero) bounded linear operator, and suppose thatQk≔{x∈Hk;Φk(x)⩽0}(fork=1,2), whereΦk:Hk→Ris a convex and continuous function with bounded sub-differential∂Φk. Let(xn)be the sequence generated from anyx0∈H1by(6.4a)vn=xn+βnA∗(T(Φ2)-I)Axn,(6.4b)xn+1=αnCxn+(1-αn)[(1-w)I+wT(Φ1)]vn,whereT(Φk):Hk→Hk(fork=1,2) is a subgradient projection operator relative toΦk,C:H1→H1is a strict contraction,w∈(0,2),(αn)is a sequence verifying (C6), and the parameter(βn)is such thatβn=2(1-∊n)|(T(Φ2)-I)Axn|2|A∗(T(Φ2)-I)Axn|2,if(T(Φ2)-I)Axn≠0,where(∊n)⊂0,1)satisfieslimn→+∞αn∊n=0. Then(xn)converges strongly to the unique elementu∈Ω(Ωbeing defined in(6.1)) verifyingu=(PΩ∘C)(u).This result is deduced from Remark 6.1 and Theorem 3.2 with regard to the special situation whenT=T(Φ1)andS=T(Φ2). □A more explicit operator can be introduced when facing constraints of the form (6.3) in (6.1), which obviously enters the case (6.2) withΦk(x)=max1⩽i⩽rk-lk,i(x).Remark 6.2Let Q be a collection of r half subspacesHi(i=1,…,r), associated with a family of pairs(ai,bi)i=1,…,r⊂H×R(withai≠0fori=1,…,r), namely(6.5)Q=∩i=1,…,rHi,whereHi={x∈H|li(x)=〈ai,x〉+bi⩾0}.LetP:H→Hbe the mapping defined forx∈Hby(6.6a)Px=x-lix(x)|aix|-2aix,ifIx≠∅,x,ifIx=∅,(6.6b)whereIx≔{j∈{1,…,r}|lj(x)⩽0},(6.6c)andix=mini∈Ix||lix(x)|=maxj∈Ix|lj(x)|,ifIx≠∅.Then it can be observed thatQ=Fix(P)and that Px is nothing but the projection of x onto the hyperplan(6.7)Kix={z∈H|lix(z)=0}.The following result can be found in Maingé and Maruster (2011) for Euclidean spaces. The proof of the first part (c1) follows the same lines as in Maingé and Maruster (2011), but the second part (c2) is given with some modifications.Lemma 6.1LetP:H→Hbe defined as inRemark 6.2. Then P satisfies the following statements: (c1)P∈EFQ; (c2)I-Pis demiclosed.We first prove (c1). Letx∈Hbe such thatIx≠∅(hencex-Px=lix(x)|aix|-2aix) and letp∈Fix(P)(that is,li(p)⩾0, fori=1,…,r). It is readily checked that(6.8)〈x-Px,x-p〉=lix(x)|aix|-2〈aix,x-p〉.Furthermore, by definition oflix, we clearly have〈aix,x-p〉=lix(x)-lix(p), so thatlix(x)〈aix,x-p〉=lix2(x)-lix(x)lix(p). Hence, noting thatlix(x)⩽0(asix∈Ix) and thatlix(p)⩾0(asp∈Fix(P)), we getlix(x)〈aix,x-p〉⩾lix2(x). Consequently, by (6.8), we deduce that(6.9)〈x-Px,x-p〉⩾lix(x)2|aix|-2=|x-Px|2.We next prove (c2). Let(xn)be a sequence inHsuch that|xn-Pxn|→0(asn→∞) and such that(xn)converges weakly to some elementp∈H. Then we immediately havelixn(xn)2|aixn|2=|xn-Pxn|2→0(asn→+∞). It is also clear that the sequence(|aixn|)is bounded away from zero (sinceixn∈{1,…,r}andaj≠0forj∈{1,…,r}). So, it results thatlimn→+∞lixn(xn)=0. Moreover, from the definition oflj(forj=1,…,r), we readily havelj(xn)→lj(p). Clearly, ifxn0∈Fix(P), for somen0∈N, then it follows thatxn=pforn⩾n0, which yieldsp∈Fix(P). Otherwise, that is, ifxn∉Fix(P)for anyn∈N, then, by definition of P, we haveIxn≠∅for anyn∈N. Now, given any indexj∈{1,…,r}, we wish to prove thatlj(p)⩾0. So, we consider the following two possibilities:–Assume that there existsn1∈Nsuch thatj∉Ixnfor anyn⩾n1. From definition ofIxn, we deduced thatlj(xn)>0(for anyn⩾n1). Hence, bylj(p)=limn→+∞=lj(xn), we are led tolj(p)⩾0.Assume that for anyn∈N, there exists some integeri⩾nsuch thatj∈Ixi. It is therefore clear that there exist a subsequence (xnk) of (xn) such thatixnk=j(for anyk∈N) and such that(xnk)converges weakly to p inH(ask→+∞). It follows thatlj(xnk)=lxnk(xnk)(asj=ixnk), which yieldslimk→+∞lj(xnk)=0. So, by weak convergence of(xnk)to p (ask→+∞), we deduce thatlj(p)=0.Consequently we obtainlj(p)⩾0(forj=1,…,r), which means thatp∈Fix(P). □From Remark 6.2 and Lemma 6.1, we can see that Theorem 6.1 still holds when the involved set of constraintsQk(fork=1and/ork=2) is given by (6.3) andT(Φk)is replaced by the operator given by (6.6) relative toQk.In the specific case whenC=I-λ∇Ψ, where∇Ψ:H1→H1denotes the gradient of some convex and differentiable functionΨ:H1→R, andλis some positive parameter, we stress that solution of (3.2) (that is the limit attained by (2.3)) is a minimizer ofΨoverΩ. provided that (for some positive values L andη)∇Ψ:H1→H1is L-Lipchitz continuous (i.e.,|∇Ψ(x)-∇Ψ(y)|⩽L|x-y|, forx,y∈H1) andη-strongly monotone onH1(i.e.,〈∇Ψ(x)-∇Ψ(y),x-y〉⩾η|x-y|2, forx,y∈H1), and thatλ∈(0,2η/L2). Indeed, under these conditions, we readily obtain|Cx-Cy|2⩽1-2η-λL2|x-y|2. Hence, forλ∈(0,2η/L2),Cbecomes a strict contraction. It is then a classical matter to see that (3.2) and the minimization problemminΩΨare equivalent. In particular, whenΨ(x)=(1/2)|x-a|2(for somea∈H1), we have∇Ψ(x)=x-a. So,∇Ψis 1-Lipschitz continuous and 1-strongly monotone, and we getCx=x-λ∇Ψ(x)=a(forλ=1).In this section we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm relative to an inverse heat conduction problem.Consider the Volterra integral equation of the first kind: findu∈L2(0,1)such that(7.1)(Ku)(t):=∫0tκ(t-s)u(s)ds=f(t),0⩽t⩽1,whereκis a kernel function of convolution type defined byκ(0)=0andκ(t)=12πt3/2e-1/4t, fort∈(0,1], while the data f is some real-valued function on[0,1]verifyingf(0)=0.Remark 7.1K is a (compact) linear operator fromL2(0,1)toL∞(0,1)(see, e.g., Clason, 2012).Problem (7.1) corresponds to sideways heat equation in a quarter plane, which consists of determining the value of a heat sourceu=u(t)(0<t⩽1) at positionx=0, by exploiting temperature measurementsf=f(t)(0⩽t⩽1)at positionx=1. The interested reader is referred to Lamm and Elden (1997), Lamm (2000), and Clason (2012) for more information on this subject.In practice, the measurement of the data f is often corrupted by some noise, so that only a noisy data is available. Specifically we focus on the case of an uniformly distributed noise. Regarding this framework, Clason (2012) has recently discussed some regularization-like processes based onL∞fitting, so as to approximate the original solution. It turns out that theL∞norm is more appropriate (than theL2norm) to measure the data misfit. It was also considered the particular case of a noisy datafδwith level noiseδ(for some positive valueδ), namely the (unknown) true data f satisfies‖fδ-f‖L∞(0,1)⩽δ. In this latter situation, we seek an approximationuδof the exact solution u, through the following regularized problem: finduδ∈L2(0,1)such that(7.2)‖uδ‖L2(0,1)=minv∈Γ‖v‖L2(0,1),whereΓ=w∈L2(0,1);‖Kw-fδ‖L∞(0,1)⩽δ.Such approaches gave rise to numerical algorithms based upon methods (using judicious penalty functions), combined with semi-smooth Newton methods.Remark 7.3Note that the set of constraintsΓin (7.2) can be rewritten asΓ=w∈L2(0,1);Kw∈B‾∞(fδ,δ),whereB‾∞(fδ,δ)⊂L2(0,1)denotes the closed ball inL∞norm of centerfδand radiusδ, namelyB‾∞(fδ,δ)={w∈L∞(0,1);‖w-fδ‖L∞(0,1)⩽δ}.From a practical viewpoint, we define an approximate problem for (7.2), settingh=1/Nand denotingti=ih(fori=0,…,N), andti+1/2=ti+h/2(fori=0,…,N-1).First, we perform a discretization of problem (7.1) based on the composite midpoint integration rule∫0tiϕ(t)dt≈h∑j=0i-1ϕ(tj+1/2), for any given continuous functionϕon[0,1]. By approximating the integral in (7.1), we are led to the midpoint method for the approximate solution of (7.1), given byh∑j=0i-1κ(ti-tj+1/2)uj+1/2=f(ti)(fori=1,…,N), whereuj+1/2is an approximation foru(tj+1/2). Equivalently, introducing the two elements ofRNdefined byF=(f(t1),…,f(tN))TandU=(u0+1/2,…,u(N-1)+1/2), we obtain the matrix equation(7.3)AU=F,whereA=(ai,j)1⩽i,j⩽Nis a lower-triangularN×Nmatrix with entries such thatai,j=hκ(ti-t(j-1)+1/2)fori=1,…,Nandj=1,…,i. More precisely, it can be checked that the discretization method used generates a Toeplitz matrix A given by(7.4)A=k10⋯0k2k1⋯0⋮⋮⋱⋮kNkN-1⋯k1with positive valueski=hκi-12h(fori=1,…,N).Next, we denote by‖·‖ptheLpnorm ofRN(forp=2orp=∞), and we extend (7.3) to an approximate model of (7.2). Precisely, we define an approximation ofuδ(tj-(1/2)h)(forj=1,…,N) by the valueujδobtained from the elementUδ=(u1δ,…,uNδ)verifying(7.5)‖Uδ‖2=minX∈Δ‖X‖2,whereΔ={Z∈RN;AZ∈D‾(Fδ,δ)},where A is the matrix defined in (7.4),Fδ=(fδ(t1),…,fδ(tN))is the discrete noisy data, andD‾(Fδ,δ)={W∈RN;‖W-Fδ‖∞⩽δ}. Clearly, (7.5) enters the setting of problem (3.2) relative to the special case whenH1=H2=RN,C=0,T=I(identity operator onRN), whileS:RN→RNis any quasi-nonexpansive operator such thatFix(S)=D‾(Fδ,δ). Note indeed that the corresponding solution to (3.3) reduces tox∗=PΔ0.Remark 7.4Let us observe that the discrete model (7.5) can be enhanced (with regard to the desired purposes) when prior information regarding the exact solution U are known. For instance, if U is known to belong to some (explicitly given) convex and closed subsetϒofRN, then it seems natural to consider (instead of (7.5)) the following model:(7.6)‖Uδ‖2=minX∈Δ′‖X‖2,whereΔ′={Z∈ϒ;AZ∈D‾(Fδ,δ)},which is also encompassed by (3.2) withH1=H2=RN,C=0, together with any quasi-nonexpansive operatorsS,T:RN→RNsuch thatFix(S)=D‾(Fδ,δ)andFix(T)=ϒ.Our goal here is to show the influence of the step-sizes(βn)on algorithm (2.3) relative to the discrete problem (7.6) withN=400,ϒ=R+N, and the other data chosen as follows.First, we setU=(u(t0),…,u(tN-1))T∈RN, for some continuous and nonnegative function u on[0,1], and we letF=AU(hence, U is the solution of (7.3) with data F).Next, we consider the noisy data given byFδ=AU+ξδ, where the noiseξδ∈RNis a uniformly distributed random value of levelδ≔‖ξδ‖∞=(1/4)‖F‖∞.Finally, by using algorithm (2.3), we compute the solutionUδof (7.6), so as to obtain a convenient reconstruction of U. The sequence generated by (2.3) is denoted(Unδ)and the following parameters and mappings are used:U0δ=0,wn=0.5,αn=1/n,Tis the metric projection ontoR+N, while S is of the type defined in Remark 6.2 relative toD‾(Fδ,δ).A classical realization of noisy data is displayed in Fig. 1. Fig. 2shows its corresponding reconstructionUδ.Figs. 3 and 4display the asymptotic behavior of the error‖Unδ-Uδ‖2with respect to the number of iteration n, for different choices of the step-sizeβn. Regarding the spectral radius ofA∗A(using the symmetric power method) we obtain2γ≈15.8(whereγ=1/|A∗A|). The convergence of the method for constant step-sizes in the range(0,2γ)appears to be very slow comparing with Polyak-type step-sizes (Fig. 3). The convergence of the method is also illustrated with regard to some limiting case of(βn)(Fig. 4). It appears for step-sizes of the formβn=λnμn(with λn∈(0,2)) that the convergence of the algorithm is not the faster the greaterλnis. Nevertheless, the convergence for the considered limiting case closely follows an optimal convergence obtained forλnclose to1.8.Fig. 5shows us how small may be the value ofγcomparing with the quantityμninvolved in the Polyak-type step-sizes.
