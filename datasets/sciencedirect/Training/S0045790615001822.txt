@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Spectrum sensing is an important aspect of cognitive radios. This paper describes a method for spectrum sensing based on the autocorrelation of the received samples. The proposed method was evaluated by means of experiments wherein the probabilities of detection and false alarm at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were observed. The platform used for the experiments was a set of Universal Software Radio Peripheral™ (USRP™) devices acting as radio frequency front ends in combination with GNU Radio software. Since the signal processing was performed in the software domain, Gaussian noise of different levels was emulated by changing the standard deviation of a Python random number generator. In addition, the output power of a signal generator was varied to obtain different levels of SNR. A metric called the Euclidean distance was derived to analyze the autocorrelation of the samples received by the USRP™ device in order to decide between two possible situations: only noise present or signal plus noise present. The proposed method was compared with two methods: one based on the value of the autocorrelation at the first lag and another one based on the power of the signal, known as energy detection spectrum sensing technique.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Studies have shown that the radio spectrum is not utilized constantly by the users this resource has been allocated to; spectrum usage is estimated to be between 5% and 85% on a block of licensed radiofrequency (RF) bands at different geographical locations and at different times [1–4]. Cognitive Radio (CR), introduced by Mitola in 2000, has been proposed as a potential solution to the problem of radio spectrum scarcity and inefficient allocation. As defined in [5], a cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio (SDR), is an intelligent heuristic wireless communication system with two main purposes: to provide highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed and to ensure the efficient use of the radio spectrum. Although most of the current research focuses on the spectrum sensing aspect of cognitive radio, this technology has also the potential to enhance the reliability of wireless networks [6]. Spectrum management based on cognitive radio technology can employ the spectrum more efficiently by exploiting it opportunistically when not used by its licensees [5,7,8]. As conceived by Mitola and Maguire [8], a cognitive radio executes the cognitive cycle, which includes observing, deciding, and taking action. Fig. 1shows a simplified version of this cycle [9].In this paper, we propose and evaluate a spectrum sensing method based on the autocorrelation of the samples received by a radio frequency front end. In this method we compare a metric, the Euclidean distance between the autocorrelation of the samples and a reference line, with a threshold in order to determine the presence or absence of signal. We compared our method with other two techniques: a technique based on the value of the autocorrelation of the samples at the first lag, and a technique based on the power of the received signal, known as energy detection. To perform such comparison we used the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm as criteria. We obtained those probabilities through simulations and real experiments with GNU radio software and Python along with a set of Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP™) devices acting as radio frequency front ends.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief overview of the related work on spectrum sensing. Section 3 presents the mathematical background of spectrum sensing based on autocorrelation, explains the proposed method, and the experimental setup used to assess it. Section 4 presents and analyzes the results of the experiments. This section compares the proposed technique with the energy detection and autocorrelation at the first lag techniques in terms of probability of detection and false alarm. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 5.
