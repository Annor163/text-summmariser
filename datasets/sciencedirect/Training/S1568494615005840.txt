@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) has been a hot topic in decision making and systems engineering. The dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs) is a useful tool to deal with vagueness and ambiguity in the MADM problems. In this paper, we propose a wide range of dual hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm for dual hesitant fuzzy information. We first redefine some basic operations of dual hesitant fuzzy sets, which are consistent with those of dual hesitant fuzzy sets. We introduce three kinds of distance measures for dual hesitant fuzzy sets, which the corresponding support measures can be obtained. Then we propose several power aggregation operators on dual hesitant fuzzy sets, study their properties and give some specific dual hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. In the end, we develop two approaches for multiple attribute group decision making with dual hesitant fuzzy information, and illustrate a real world example to show the behavior of the proposed operators.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fuzzy sets theory [1] has been wide and successfully applied in many different areas to handle such a type of uncertainty. Atanassov [2,3] proposed the intuitionistic fuzzyset (IFS) using two characteristic functions expressing the degree of membership and the degree of non-membership of elements of the universal set to the IFS. In 2009, Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) were originally introduced by Torra [4,5], allowing the membership of an element to be a set of several possible values, is very useful to express people's hesitancy in daily life. HFSs have attracted the attention of many researchers in a short period, of time because hesitant situations are very common in different real world problems and this new approach facilitates the management of uncertainty provoked by hesitation [6–11]. Rodríguez et al. presented an overview on hesitant fuzzy sets with the aim of providing a clear perspective on the different concepts, tools and trends related to this extension of fuzzy sets [6].Usually real world problems are complex and it is impossible to achieve any optimal decision considering only a single criterion. The fundamental prerequisite of decision making is how to aggregate individual experts’ preference information on alternatives. Information aggregation is a process that combines individual experts’ preferences into an overall one by using a proper aggregation technique [12]. Aggregation operators are the most widely used tool for combining individual preference information into overall preference information and deriving collective preference values for each alternative. The investigation on information aggregation has received surprisingly extensive attention from practitioners and researchers due to its practical and academic significance [13–16]. Based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm [17,18], and the aggregation functions for the classical FSs [19,20], Beliakov et al. [21] gave some operations about IFSs, proposed two general concepts for constructing other types of aggregation operators for IFSs extending the existing methods and showed that the operators obtained by using the Łukasiewicz t-norm are consistent with the ones on ordinary FSs. Xia and Xu [22] introduced a series of aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information and discussed the relationships among them. Qian et al. [23] extended HFSs by IFSs and referred to them as Generalized HFSs (GHFSs), and redefined some basic operations of GHFSs.In contrast with above aggregation, Yager [24] developed a power average (PA) operator and a power ordered weighted average (POWA) operator to provide aggregation tools for which the weight vectors depend on the input arguments and that allow the values being aggregated to support and reinforce one another. Motivated by Yager, Xu and Yager [25] proposed a power geometric (PG) operator and a power ordered weighted (POWG) operator. However, the arguments of these power aggregation operators are exact numerical values. In practice, we often encounter situations in which the input arguments cannot be expressed as exact numerical values. Zhou et al. [26] presented the generalized power average (GPA) operator and the generalized power ordered weighted average (GPOWA) operator. Xu [27] and Zhou et al. [12] extended the PA, POWA, PG, and POWG operators to intuitionistic fuzzy environments and developed some intuitionistic fuzzy power aggregation operators. Zhang [28] developed a series of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy power geometric operators to aggregate input arguments that are intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and studied some desired properties of these aggregation operators and investigate the relationships among these operators. Dong [29] developed several techniques using power aggregation operators to fuse hesitant fuzzy information. We can find the above aggregation operators are mostly based on different t-conorms and t-norms and are used to deal with different relationships of the aggregated arguments, which can provide more choices for the decision makers.In 2012, Zhu and Xu [30] introduced the definition of dual hesitant fuzzy set, which used the membership hesitancy function and the non-membership hesitancy function to support a more exemplary and flexible access to assign values for each element in the domain. DHFSs have attracted the attention of many researchers in a short period of time because as an important extension of hesitant fuzzy sets, DHFS can be regarded as a more comprehensive set, which supports a more flexible approach when the decision makers provide their judgments. The existing sets, including fuzzy sets (FSs), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) can be regarded as special cases of DHFSs. In the real world, when experts make a decision, they are usually hesitant and irresolute for one thing or another which makes it difficult to reach a final agreement. They further indicated that DHFSs can better deal with the situations that permit both the membership and the no-membership of an element to a given set having a few different values, which can arise in a group decision making problem. For example, a decision organization with two groups of experts is authorized to assess both the satisfactory degree and the unsatisfactory degree of an alternative with respect to a criterion. Priorities of experts in each group are indifferent. In Group 1, some experts discuss the membership degree 0.5 and the non-membership 0.4 of an alternative A satisfies a criterion x, others provide (0.6, 0.2), and thus the assessment can be represented by a DHFS {{0.5, 0.6}, {0.4, 0.2}}. While in Group 2, some experts argue between 0.5 and 0.7, and others insist on at least membership degree 0.6, then these two possible memberships can be represent by {{0.5, 0.6}, {1−0.7, 0}}. The two groups of decision makers cannot persuade one another to change their opinions. An alternative resolution of this problem is that aggregating the information among groups. The previously proposed power aggregation operators are not applicable to situations in which the input arguments take the form of dual hesitant fuzzy sets. Some aggregation operations and distance measures have also been developed by researchers [31–34]. Lei Wang [31], Farhadinia [32], Jun Ye [33] mainly discussed the correlation measures of dual hesitant fuzzy information. Wang proposed some correlation measures of dual hesitant fuzzy elements, obtained several important conclusions, and given an example to illustrate the correlation measures. Farhadinia proposed an approach for deriving the correlation coefficient of DHFs, and then extend the approach to the dual interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets. Then, Jun Ye utilize the weighted correlation coefficient to solve dual hesitant fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making problems. Huang et al. [34] developed the dual hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (DHFOWA) operator and the dual hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (DHFOWG) operator. Nevertheless, it presented limitations to deal with the values being aggregated to support and reinforce one another. Our interest is focused on information aggregation of dual fuzzy sets theory. It is, therefore, necessary to extend the existing power aggregation operators to dual hesitant fuzzy environments and to develop new power aggregation operators for aggregating dual hesitant fuzzy information. In this paper, we first review the dual hesitant fuzzy, and then give some new dual hesitant fuzzy operations based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, such as union, intersection and some arithmetic operation on their elements. We also introduce some distance measures for DHFSs, which the corresponding support measures can be obtained. We further propose some dual hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, obtain some important conclusions, and propose some specific dual hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators.To do this, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some basic concepts related to DHFSs, Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, PA operator, and proposes some new dual hesitant fuzzy operational laws based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm. In Section 3, we first give some distance measures for DHFSs. Then, we present a variety of dual hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, investigate some of their basic properties, and discuss the relationships between the various operators. In Section 4, we develops two approaches to multiple attribute group decision making with dual hesitant fuzzy information based on the proposed operators and in Section 5 use a real world example to illustrate our algorithm. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with some remarks.Definition 1(31). Let X be a fixed set, then a dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) D on X is described as:Zhu and Xu [30] defined the following operational laws for DHFEs:Definition 2(31). Given a DHFE represented by the function α, and α≠∅, its complement is defined as:(31). Let X be a fixed set, α1 and α2 two DHFEs, Then:(1)α1∪α2={hα∈(hα1∪hα2)|hα≥max(hα1−,hα2−),gα∈(gα1∩gα2)|gα≤min(gα1+,gα2+)};α1∩α2={hα∈(hα1∩hα2)|hα≤min(hα1+,hα2+),gα∈(gα1∪gα2)|gα≥max(gα1−,gα2−)};α1⊕α2=∪γα1∈hα1,ηα1∈gα1,γα2∈hα2,ηα2∈gα2{{γα1+γα2−γα1γα2},{ηα1ηα2}};α1⊗α2=∪γα1∈hα1,ηα1∈gα1,γα2∈hα2,ηα2∈gα2{{γα1γα2},{ηα1+ηα2−ηα1ηα2}};nα=∪γα∈hα,ηα∈gα{1−(1−γα)n,(ηα)n};αn=∪γα∈hα,ηα∈gα{(γα)n,1−(1−ηα)n}.To compare the DHFEs, Zhu and Xu gave the following comparison laws:Definition 4(31). Letαi={hdi,gdi}(i=1, 2) be any two DHFEs, the score function of α and the accuracy function of α, is defined as:ifsα1>sα2, then α1 is superior to α2, denoted by α1≻α2;ifsα1=sα2, then(1)ifpα1=pα2, then α1 is equivalent to α2, denoted by α1∼α2;ifpα1>pα2, then α1 is superior than α2, denoted by α1≻α2.Definition 5(17, 18). A function T: [0, 1]×[0, 1]→[0, 1] is called a t-norm if it satisfies the following four conditions:(1)T(1, x)=x, for all x.T(x, y)=T(y, x), for all x and y.T(x, T(y, z))=T(T(x, y), z), for all x, y and z.If x≤x′ and y≤y′, then T(x, y)≤T(x′, y′).(17, 18). A function S: [0, 1]×[0, 1]→[0, 1] is called a t-conorm if it satisfies the following four conditions:(1)S(0, x)=x, for all x.S(x, y)=S(y, x), for all x and y.S(x, S(y, z))=S(S(x, y), z), for all x, y and z.If x≤x′ and y≤y′, then S(x, y)≤S(x′, y′).It is also usually required that a t-norm and a t-conorm are continuous functions.Definition 7(17, 18). A t-norm function T(x, y) is called Archimedean t-norm if it is continuous and T(x, x)<x for all x∈(0, 1). An Archimedean t-norm is called strictly Archimedean t-norm if it is strictly increasing in each variable for x, y∈(0, 1).(17, 18). A t-conorm function S(x, y) is called Archimedean t-conorm if it is continuous and S(x, x)>x for all x∈(0, 1). An Archimedean t-conorm is called strictly Archimedean t-conorm if it is strictly increasing in each variable for x, y∈(0, 1).It is well known [35] that a strict Archimedean t-norm is expressed via its additive generator k as T(x, y)=k−1(k(x)+k(y)), and similarly, applied to its dual t-conorm S(x, y)=l−1(l(x)+l(y)) with l(t)=k(1−t). We notice that an additive generator of a continuous Archimedean t-norm is a strictly decreasing function k: [0, 1]→[0, ∞] such that k(1)=0.Based on Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm, Beliakov et al. [21] defined the sum operation on two IFNsαi=(ui,vi)(i=1,2)asα1⊕α2=(S(uα1,uα2),T(vα1,vα2)),which can be expressed by the following:α1⊕α2=(S(uα1,uα2),T(vα1,vα2))=(l−1(l(uα1)+l(uα2)),k−1(k(vα1)+k(vα2)))With the above analysis, we define the operations about DHFEs based on Archimedean t-norm and Archimedean t-conorm as follows:Definition 9Let X be a fixed set, α1 and α2 two DHFEs, Then:Definition 9 is motivated by the generalized idea provided by Xia and Xu [36]. Especially, if k(t)=−log(t), then we have the operational laws by Zhu and Xu [30] (Definition 2).Ifkt=log2−tt, then we have:(1)α1⊕α2=∪γα1∈hα1,γα2∈hα2γα1+γα21+γα1γα2,∪ηα1∈gα1,ηα2∈gα2ηα1ηα21−(1−ηα1)(1−ηα2);(2)α1⊗α2=∪γα1∈hα1,γα2∈hα2γα1γα21−(1−γα1)(1−γα2),∪ηα1∈gα1,ηα2∈gα2ηα1+ηα21+ηα1ηα2;(3)nα=∪γα∈hα(1+γα)n−(1−γα)n(1+γα)n+(1−γα)n,∪ηα∈gα2ηα(2−ηα)n+ηαn;(4)αn=∪γα∈hα2γα2−γαn+γαn,∪ηα∈gα(1+ηα)n−(1−ηα)n(1+ηα)n+(1−ηα)n.Yager [24] introduced a nonlinear weighted-average aggregation tool, which is called power average operator as follows:Definition 10(24). The power average (PA) operator is the mapping PA: Rn→R defined by the following formula:Based on the OWA operator and the PA operator, Yager defined a power ordered weighted average (POWA) operator as follows:Definition 11(24). The power ordered weighted average (POWA) operator is the mapping PA: Rn→R defined by the following formula:In the above equations,aindexiis the ith largest argument of all the arguments, T(aindex(i)) denotes the support of the ith largest argument by all the other arguments, Sup(aindex(i), aindex(j)) indicates the support foraindexifromaindexj, and g:[0, 1]→[0, 1] is a basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function that has the following properties: (1)g0=0, (2)g1=1,(3) if x>y, thengx≥gy.Motivated by Yager [24] and based on the PA operator and the geometric mean, Xu and Yager [25] defined the power geometric (PG) operator:Definition 12(25). The power geometric (PG) operator is the mapping PG: Rn→R defined by the following formula:(25). The power ordered weighted geometric (POWG) operator is the mapping PG: Rn→R defined by the following formula:In this section, we extend the power aggregation operators to accommodate dual hesitant fuzzy information as input. Little has been done about distance and similarity measures of DHFEs. As we know, the support measure indicates the degree of similarity of two elements. We first introduce the concept of distance of DHFEs and then propose some new distance measures for DHFSs.Definition 14For two DHFEs α1 and α2, the distance between α1 and α2, denoted as d(α1, α2), should satisfy the following properties:It is noted that the number of values in different DHFEs may be different, let lh(d(x))=(#h) be the number of values in h(x) and lg(d(x))=(#g) be the number of values in g(x), l(d(x))=(lh(d(x)), lg(d(x)))=(#h, #g). Let two DHFEs α1 and α2, in most cases, l(α1)≠l(α2), i.e. lh(α1)≠lh(α2) and lg(α1)≠lg(α2). For convenience, let l=lh+lg, where lh=max{lh(α1), lh(α1)}; lg=max{lg(α1), lg(α2)}. We should extend the shorter one until both of them have the same length when we compare them. To extend the shorter one, the best way is to add the same value several times in it. The selection of this value mainly depends on the decision makers’ risk preferences. Optimists anticipate desirable outcomes and may add the maximum value, while pessimists expect unfavorable outcomes and may add the minimum value. For example, let α1={{0.6, 0.5, 0.4}, {0.2, 0.1}} and α2={{0.7, 0.6}, {0.3, 0.2}}. To operate correctly, the optimist may extend α2={{0.7, 0.6}, {0.3, 0.2}} to α2={{0.7, 0.7, 0.6}, {0.3, 0.2}} and the pessimist may extend it as α2={{0.7, 0.6, 0.6}, {0.3, 0.2}}. We extended the shorter one by adding different values in hesitant fuzzy environments. The same situation can also be found in many existing Refs [37,38]. To operate correctly, we suppose that two DHFEs α1 and α2 have the same length (lh, lg). We can also find that the values in a DHFE are out of order; we can arrange them in any order. For a DHFE α, let σ: (1, 2, 3, …, n)→(1, 2, 3, …, n) be a permutation satisfying:γσ(i)[α]≤γσ(i+1)[α],γ[α]∈h[α],i=1,2,…,lh(α);ησ(i)[α]≤ησ(i+1)[α],η[α]∈g[α],i=1,2,…,lg(α).Definition 15Let two DHFEs α1=(h1, g1) and α2=(h2, g2) Then:Now we discuss three special cases of the generalized dual hesitant distance d(α1, α2):1. if λ=1, d(α1, α2) is reduced to a dual hesitant Hamming distance:ddhh(α1,α2)=1l∑i=1lhγσ(i)[α1]−γσ(i)α2+∑j=1lgησ(j)[α1]−ησ(j)α2;2. if λ=2, then d(α1, α2) is reduced to a dual hesitant Euclidean distance:ddhe(α1,α2)=1l∑i=1lhγσ(i)[α1]−γσ(i)α22+∑j=1lgησ(j)[α1]−ησ(j)α221/2;3. if λ→+∞, then d(α1, α2) is reduced to a dual hesitant Hamming–Hausdorff distance:ddhhh(α1,α2)=maxmaxiγσ(i)[α1]−γσ(i)[α2],maxjησ(j)[α1]−ησ(j)[α2].Wan [39] proposed PA operators of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). Zhang [40] developed a wide range of hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information. Then, we investigate the power aggregation operators in dual hesitant fuzzy environments and develop a series of dual hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators.Definition 16Letαi={hαi,gαi}(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of DHFEs, a Dual hesitant fuzzy power average power average (DHFPA) operator and a Dual hesitant fuzzy power average power geometric (DHFPG) operator are defined by the following formula:Clearly, the DHFPA and DHFPG operators are two nonlinear weighted aggregation tools, and the weightwi=1+Tαi/∑i=1n1+Tαiof argument αidepends on all of the input argumentsαjj=1,2,…,nand allows the argument values to support each other in the aggregation process.The support measure is essentially a similarity measure, and the similarity measure involves both similarity and dissimilarity. Furthermore, based on the definitions 14 and 15, we can seeSupai,aj=1−dai,aj. The higher the similarity is, the smaller the distance between the two DHFEs and the more they support each other.Theorem 1Letαi={hαi,gαi}(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of DHFEs. The aggregated value using the DHFPA or DHFPG operator is also a DHFE, andSee Appendix A.Then we can investigate some desirable properties of the ATS-DHFPA and ATS-DHFPA operator:Property 1If all Sup(αi, αj)=k, i≠j, (i, j=1, 2, ..., n), thenSee Appendix B.(Commutativity). Letαi={hαi,gαi}(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of DHFEs. Then, ifα′i={h′αi,g′αi}(i=1, 2, …, n) any permutation ofαi={hαi,gαi}, then we have:However, the ATS-DHFPA and ATS-DHFPG operator are neither idempotent, bounded, nor monotonic, as illustrated by the following example.ExampleLet α1={{0.7, 0.5}, {0.3, 0.2}}, α2={{0.8, 0.5}, {0.2.0.1}}, α3={{0.6, 0.4}, {0.3, 0.2}} and α4={{0.9, 0.8}, {0.1, 0}} be four DHFEs,. Assume that d(αi, αj)(i, j=1, 2, 3, 4, i≠j) is the dual hesitant Hamming distance between αiand αj, k(t)=−log(t), we haveAccording to Definition 4, we havesα1=0.35,sα2=0.5,sα3=0.25,sα4=0.8,sATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1=0.4326,sATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α3=0.3235,sATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α4=0.6114. Therefore,ATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1≠α1, which implies that the DHFPA operator is not idempotent.Furthermore, becausesATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1>sα1, which implies that the DHFPA operator is not bounded.Finally, becausesATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1>sATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α3andsATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1<sATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α4,we haveATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1≻ATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α3andATS-DHFPAα1,α1,α1≺ATS-DHFPAα1,α2,α4.Therefore, the DHFPA operator is not monotonic.Then, we can investigate some desirable properties of the ATS-DHFPA and ATS-DHFPG operator by using different k and l.Case 1. If k(t)=−log(t), then the ATS-DHFA and ATS-DHFPG operator reduce to the following:(11)SDHFPAαii=1,2,…,n=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n1−∏i=1n(1−γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi,∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1nηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi(12)SDHFPGαii=1,2,…,n=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1nγαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi,∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n1−∏i=1n(1−ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+TαiCase 2. If k(t)=log(2−t/t), then the ATS-DHFA and ATS-DHFPG operator reduce to the following:(13)EDHFPA(α1,α2,...,αn)=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1n(1+γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−∏i=1n(1−γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n(1+γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi+∏i=1n(1−γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi;∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n2∏i=1nηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n2−ηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi+∏i=1nηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi(14)EDHFPG(α1,α2,...,αn)=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n2∏i=1nγαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n2−γαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi+∏i=1nγαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi,∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1n(1+ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−∏i=1n(1−ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n(1+ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi+∏i=1n(1−ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαiwhich are called the Einstein dual hesitant fuzzy power average (EDHFPA) and the Einstein dual hesitant fuzzy power geometric (EDHFPG)operator.Case 3. If k(t)=log((τ+(1−τ)t)/t), τ>0, then the ATS-DHFA and ATS-DHFPG operator reduce to the following:(15)HDHFPA(α1,α2,...,αn)=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1n(1−1−τγαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−∏i=1n(1−γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n(1−1−τγαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−1−τ∏i=1n(1−γαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi,∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,nτ∏i=1nηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n1−1−τ1−ηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−1−τ∏i=1nηαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi(16)HDHFPG(α1,α2,...,αn)=∪γαi∈hαi,⁡i=1,2,…,nτ∏i=1nγαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n1−1−τ1−γαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−1−τ∏i=1nγαi1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi,∪ηαi∈gαi,⁡i=1,2,…,n∏i=1n(1−1−τηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−∏i=1n(1−ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi∏i=1n(1−1−τηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαi−1−τ∏i=1n(1−ηαi)1+Tαi∑i=1n1+Tαiwhich are called the Hammer dual hesitant fuzzy power average (HDHFPA) and the Hammer dual hesitant fuzzy power geometric (HDHFPG)operator. Especially, if τ=1, then the HDHFPA and HDHFPG operator reduce to the SDHFPA and SDHFPG operator and; if τ=2, then the HDHFPA and HDHFPG operator reduce to the EDHFPA and EDHFPG operator.Case 4.

Driving is a complex task involving a variety of skills. The most important of these skills involve taking in and processing information and making quick decisions based on this information. Driver tasks are categorized into three main elements: control, guidance, and navigation. Therefore, selecting a safe path and keeping the vehicle in the proper lane are of great importance for the drivers. But it is hard to choose the most suitable one among the alternatives which dominate each other in different characteristics. The aim of our specific study is to provide some techniques for estimating the capacity and determining the level of service for transportation facilities, and to help the decision-makers accordingly in terms of user requirements to select a proper route. Now the standard for route choice is average travel speed, density, average queue length, and level of service:(1)Average travel speed (ATS) is computed by dividing the length of the highway, street section, or segment under consideration by the average travel time of the vehicles traversing it; If travel times t1, t2, t3, …, tn(in hours) are measured for n vehicles traversing a segment of length L, the average travel speed is computed usingu¯s=L⋅n∑i=1nti=L(1/n)∑i=1nti=Lta,u¯sis the average travel speed (mi/h), L the length of the highway segment (mi), n is the number of travel times observed, tithe travel time of the ith vehicle to traverse the section (h), and tathe average travel time over L(h).Density (D) is the number of vehicles (or pedestrians) occupying a given length of a lane or roadway at a particular instant. For the computations, density is averaged over time and is usually expressed as vehicles per mile (veh/mi) or passenger cars per mile (pc/mi),k=q/u¯s, where q is the flow rate (veh/h),u¯sthe average travel speed (mi/h).The average queue length (AQL), at the beginning of red, the queue length is zero and increases to its maximum value at the end of the red period. Then the queue length decreases until the arrival line intersects the service line, when the queue length equals zero, Q=QMtQ/2C, where QM=maximumqueuelength(veh), tQ=timedurationofqueue(s), C=cyclelength(s).Level of service (LOS) is a quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream.Suppose one driver want to travel from Ming Palace Museum (The green starting station) to Confucius Temple (The red terminal station) in Nanjing. After preliminary screening, four routes xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4) remain on the candidate list (see Fig. 1).In real world applications, all the parameters of the transportation problems may not be known precisely due to uncontrollable factors. This type of imprecise data is not always well represented by random variable selected from a probability distribution. Fuzzy number may represent this data. For the application, an expert team was formed from three junior managers ek(k=1, 2, 3) of the Urban Traffic Management Department (UTMD), whose weight vector iswe=0.3,0.3,0.4T. For convenience, letG=G1=ATS,G2=D,G3=AQL,G4=LOS. The weight vector of the attributesGjj=1,2,3,4iswG=0.15,0.20,0.20,0.45T. The experts ek(k=1, 2, 3) evaluate the routes xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4) with respect to the attributes Gj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) and construct the following three dual hesitant fuzzy decision matrices.Ak=aijk4×4(k=1,2,3)are presented in Tables 1–3. Among the considered attributes.Assume that the weights of the decision makers and attributes are known. We use Approach 1 to select the route.Step 1.

Use the WGDHFPA operator (Eq. (65), here, we choose one case: k(t)=−log(t), Eq. (35)) to aggregate all of the individual hesitant fuzzy decision matricesRk=rijk4×4k=1,2,3into the collective hesitant fuzzy decision matrixR=rij4×4k=1,2,3(see Tables 4–6).Step 4. Calculate the score function of rijand use Eq. (68) to aggregate all of the score function (see Tables 7–9).Step 5. From the Tables 7–9, we can seesx3>sx2>sx1>sx4for all the distance measures, and the best choice is the third route.When, we change the parameter λ, we can obtain the different results (Tables 10–12).We now present a figure to clearly demonstrate how the score values vary as the parameter λ increases and the aggregation arguments are kept fixed (see Fig. 2). In Fig. 2, we choose ATS-WGDHFPA operator based on hesitant Euclidean distance. We only use k(t)=−log(t), the others can be obtained similarly.
