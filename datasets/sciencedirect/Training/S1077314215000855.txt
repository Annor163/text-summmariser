@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Surveillance cameras have become a customary security equipment in buildings and streets worldwide. It is up to the field of Computational Forensics to provide automated methods for extracting and analyzing relevant image data captured by such equipment. In this article, we describe an effective and semi-automated method for detecting vanishing points, with their subsequent application to the problem of computing heights in single images. With no necessary camera calibration, our method iteratively clusters segments in the bi-dimensional projective space, identifying all vanishing points – finite and infinite – in an image. We conduct experiments on images of man-made environments to evaluate the output of the proposed method and we also consider its application on a photogrammetry framework.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
By analyzing certain image properties – known object size, occlusion, stereoscopic vision, focus, gradient, texture and vergence – we can infer three-dimensional (3D) information of the geometry portrayed in the images. This inferred 3D data can be employed in various computer vision applications: image-based rendering [1,2], automated driving [3], object detection [4], and forensic science [5].The process of extracting, from images, geometric properties, such as heights, areas, and angles, is denominated by photogrammetry. Photogrammetry methods are widely used in forensic investigations, where it can help corroborate pieces of evidence [5]. Analysis of car accidents and of human height are the two main examples of forensic activities that involve photogrammetry [5].Considering images captured by surveillance cameras, for instance, with the aid of photogrammetry we can estimate the height of objects and people, useful identification characteristic when the face of the suspects cannot be identified or the details in their clothes are not relevant. Conversely, the suspects are often not on the crime scene at the time of the investigation, or the scene has changed. In these cases, the images themselves are the only source of information.When only one image depicting the scene is available, the essential problem is the recovery of the third dimension, given that this information was not captured in the acquisition process, in which the 3D scene was projected onto the 2D image plane. In particular, perspective distortions also occur. For example, objects that are away from the camera appear smaller in the image than objects that are closer.To solve this problem, the first photogrammetrists assumed some a priori information: internal camera parameters (focal length, optical center, scale, distortions, and skew factor), and the camera position in relation to the scene. However, this is only valid when the accuracy of these values is high, since any deviation can generate large measurement errors [6].Recent works on photogrammetry can be generally classified into two categories: the ones that exploit 3D information from multiple images and the ones that analyze geometric properties in a single image. The first category deals with 3D reconstruction of the scene, from multiple views, to estimate homography or to calibrate the camera [7–9]. Single-view based methods can only rely on the analysis of geometric properties [10–13] but, in this scenario, they often use previously positioned markers for calibration purposes [11,12]. Although these methods attain high accuracy, they cannot be used in forensic applications, where often a previously taken image is the only source of information.Here we propose a single-view method that detects vanishing points – invariant geometric features that can aid photogrammetry. A vanishing point can be defined as an image point where the projection of a set of real-world parallel lines converges, assuming perspective projection. A vanishing line is a line that contains two vanishing points.The credit for discovering linear perspective is given to renaissance artist Leon Battista Alberti and architect Filippo Brunelleschi [14]. Alberti’s treatise, De pictura[15], published in 1435, encloses the first scientific study of perspective. By the 1470s, several artists were able to produce their works of art demonstrating a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci, beginning in 1481, also studied and employed perspective in his earlier paintings (Fig. 1).In this article, we use a geometric approach to effectively estimate the location of vanishing points – finite and infinite ones – in images of urban and indoor spaces, with the Manhattan-world assumption. We are assuming that the scene has a natural cartesian 3D coordinate system, which is plausible for indoor, outdoor city, and even some country scenes [16].By representing segments, initially in the image plane, in the bi-dimensional projective spaceRP2,our method clusters them into groups of segments that converge to a unique vanishing point locality. The detected features are then used to identify the ground plane and the vertical direction of the scene. This information is finally inserted into a photogrammetry algorithm proposed by Criminisi [10], with the ultimate goal of measuring the height of objects and people in single images.This article starts by presenting, in Section 2, a background on the measurement of heights in single images based on vanishing points. In Section 3, we present our vanishing point detector. In Section 4, we show how to estimate the scene vertical direction and also how to detect the ground plane vanishing line. The experiments and their results are provided in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 states the conclusions of this work.
