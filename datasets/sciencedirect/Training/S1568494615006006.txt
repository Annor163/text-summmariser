@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A replicated multi-response experiment is a process that includes more than one responses with replications. One of the main objectives in these experiments is to estimate the unknown relationship between responses and input variables simultaneously. In general, classical regression analysis is used for modeling of the responses. However, in most practical problems, the assumptions for regression analysis cannot be satisfied. In this case, alternative modeling methods such as fuzzy logic based modeling approaches can be used. In this study, fuzzy least squares regression (FLSR) and fuzzy clustering based modeling methods, which are switching fuzzy C-regression (SFCR) and Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model, are preferred. The novelty of the study is presenting the applicability of SFCR to the multi-response experiment data set with replicated response measures. Three real data set examples are given for application purposes. In order to compare the prediction performance of modeling approaches, root mean square error (RMSE) criteria is used. It is seen from the results that the SFCR gives the better prediction performance among the other fuzzy modeling approaches for the replicated multi-response experimental data sets.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
An experiment is called a multi-response experiment in which the experimental units are wanted to be evaluated with respect to more than one response. The data analysis of such experiments requires a careful consideration because of the multiple response nature of the data. Simultaneous consideration of multiple responses is necessary for building an appropriate approximating model of each unknown response. Multivariate regression analysis is applied for response modeling in the context of multiple response surface methodology (RSM), which is a collection of mathematical and statistical methods for analysis of multi-response surface problems. If responses are uncorrelated and have the same experimental design, multivariate regression analysis becomes a classical regression analysis for modeling of each responses independently. A complete and detailed explanation about multiple RSM is referred to [1–4].Although the regression analysis is considered as a basic modeling tool for defining the analytical relationship between input and response variables, it cannot be used in some cases. e.g. when the probability assumptions on responses are not justified, or the number of observations is inadequate, or the relationship between input and response variables have complexity and nonlinearity, or there is uncertain information about the data [5]. In fact, there are many cases where observations cannot be known or quantified exactly. One of these cases is multi-response experiments with replicated response measures in which the observed response values are obtained differently for each experiment condition. Generally speaking, the observed response values are uncertain due to the replication and cannot be correctly represented with a single numerical quantity. In such cases, fuzzy logic, which is firstly introduced by Zadeh [6], can be used as a common tool for modeling of the multi-response surface problems.The fuzzy logic is an extended version of classical logic and can be described as many-valued logic addressing the uncertainty phenomenon. Therefore, the fuzzy logic allows modeling uncertainty associated with vagueness, imprecision and putting this into appropriate mathematical equations. In recent years, some studies have been carried out about modeling of multi-response surface problems in fuzzy framework. In Lai and Chang [7], fuzzy regression models, based on possibility distributions of predicted responses, are first used to model the relations between process parameters and responses. Akbar et al. [8] applied fuzzy approach for modeling dual response surface (DRS) and Bashiri and Ramezani [9] is used fuzzy programming for modeling of multi-response problem. In the studies of Xie and Lee [10], Prasad and Nath [11], Lu and Antony [12], and Sharma [13], fuzzy models are generated by using Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model, called IF-THEN fuzzy-rule base. In Xu and Dong [14], Türkşen [15], and Türkşen and Apaydın [16,17], fuzzy least squares regression (FLSR) is used for modeling of multi-responses. Bashiri and Hosseininezhad [18] proposed a method to constitute a regression model based on replicates of a response and aggregate regression models so that a fuzzy regression model expresses each response. The obtained regression model includes fuzzy coefficients which consider uncertainty in the collected data. Bashiri and Hosseininezhad [19] interested on modeling of unknown response surfaces by using classical approach and fuzzy concept for responses without replicates and responses with some replicates, respectively.In this paper, multi-response surface problems with replicated response measures are modeled by using FLSR and fuzzy clustering based modeling approaches which are switching fuzzy C-regression (SFCR) and TS fuzzy model. The main purpose of the study is demonstrating the usage of SFCR for modeling of the replicated multi-response experiments. SFCR has the ability of modeling a data set which has more than two different distributions, or modeling the data set with repeated measures of the same response variable. Therefore, the SFCR is thought to be considerably appropriate for response modeling of replicated response measures in multi-response problems. During the modeling by SFCR, the data set is splitted into subsets as the number of replicated responses and a model is obtained for each subset even if the size of data set is small. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief description about multi-response experiments with replicated response measures and modeling. In Section 3, FLSR is defined in detail. In Section 4, fuzzy clustering-based modeling approaches are explained and brief description about SFCR and TS fuzzy model are given. In Section 5, three real data sets are used to illustrate the applicability of fuzzy modeling approaches with comparison results. Finally, conclusion is given in Section 6.Designing a set of experiments, called data gathering, is the first, basic, and necessary step in order to find the most valuable information about the features of the multi-response problem. The design of an experiment in the multi-response case is more complex than in the case of single response. An efficient design for one response may not be efficient for the other responses. Therefore, the choice of a design should be based on a criterion which incorporates measures of efficiency pertaining to all responses in a multi-response situation. Sometimes, the experimental design may be generated by using the replicated measures of multiple responses as given in Table 1. In Table 1, n denotes the number of experimental units and r is the number of response variables which are composed with replicated t measures. And also, each replication is measured for each setting of a group of p input variables.One of the objectives in a multi-response experiment with replicated response measures is the simultaneous modeling of the behavior of the response variables as a function of the input variables within some region of interest. Suppose that the kth response value at the ith experimental unit is represented by a general model(1)Yik(.)=fkXi,β+εik(.),i=1,2,…,n,k=1,2,…,rwhere Xiis the vector [xi1xi2…xip]′ with xijbeing the ith level of the jth coded variable (i=1, 2, …, n; j=1, 2, …, p), β is a vector of unknown parameters, ɛik(.) is a random error, and fkis a function of known form for the kth response and is assumed to be continuous. If fkis linear in the elements of β, then the general model in Eq. (1) is transformed to the linear multi-response model which can be written in matrix form as(2)Y=Xβ+εwhereY=Y′1:Y′2:…:Y′r′,β=β′1:β′2:…:β′r′,ε=ε′1:ε′2:…:ε′r′, and X is the block-diagonal matrix, X=diag(X1, X2, …, Xr). However, modeling the data set with replicated response measures, as given in Table 1, is not simple since the classical modeling assumptions can be violated and replicated measures of responses may cause uncertainty. In this case, it is necessary to represent the replicated measures without loosing much information at each experimental unit. In the studies of Kim and Lin [20], Köksoy and Muluk [21], Köksoy and Yalçınöz [22], Köksoy [23], and Köksoy and Hocaoğlu [24], the replicated responses are represented with a single quantity, e.g. mean, standard deviation and these are modeled. However, it will be more proper to define a quantity which expresses the uncertainty or vagueness of the nature of the replicated response data. Modeling methods based on fuzzy logic can be used due to its ability of dealing with the uncertainties on the responses.Fuzzy least squares regression (FLSR) is one kind of fuzzy linear regression which is used as alternative method for classical regression analysis to improve parameter estimates. The FLSR is based on the method proposed by Diamond [25]. In order to apply the FLSR to the multi-response data set, the replicated response measures are considered as fuzzy numbers. The design of multi-response experiment with fuzzy observed responses can be shown in Table 2.Throughout the paper symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers are employed for the sake of simplicity. In order to represent the observed replicated measures of kth response valueYik(.)=[yik1yik2…yikt],i=1,2,…,n,k=1,2,…,ras a triangular fuzzy number, the mean and standard deviation of the replicated measures are calculated. In this paper, 2*std.dev is assumed as the spread for fuzzification of the replicated response measures to obtain an interval similar as a 95% confidence level. The triangular fuzzy value of kth response is given asY˜k=Ykl,Ykc,Yku,k=1,2,…,rin which(3)Ykl=mean([Yk1Yk2…Ykt])−2*std.dev([Yk1Yk2…Ykt])Ykc=mean([Yk1Yk2…Ykt])Yku=mean([Yk1Yk2…Ykt])+2*std.dev([Yk1Yk2…Ykt]).The membership function of the symmetric triangular observed fuzzy response vector,Y˜k=Ykl,Ykc,Yku,k=1,2,…,r, is shown in Fig. 1.The general form of the fuzzy linear response model can be given as(4)Y˜k=Xβ˜k,k=1,2,…,rin which the observed response values and model coefficients are assumed as triangular fuzzy numbers, denoted asY˜k=Ykl,Ykc,Ykuandβ˜k=βkl,βkc,βku, respectively. Here, the input variables are considered crisp. In Eq. (4), the deviations between the observed and predicted responses are incorporated into the fuzzy model coefficients, βk, k=1, 2, …, r, instead of random error term. The fitted fuzzy linear response model can be written as(5)Y∼ˆk=Xβ∼ˆk,k=1,2,…,rwhereY∼ˆkandβ∼ˆkare predicted fuzzy response values and fuzzy model coefficients, denoted asY∼ˆk=Yˆkl,Yˆkc,Yˆkuandβ∼ˆk=βˆkl,βˆkc,βˆku, respectively. In this paper, it is assumed that the responses are uncorrelated and are represented by second order polynomial functions. A fitted second order fuzzy response function can be written in the form(6)Y∼ˆk=β∼ˆ0k+∑j=1pβ∼ˆjkXj+∑j=1pβ∼ˆjjkXj2+∑j=1p∑j<wpβ∼ˆjwkXjXw,k=1,2,…,rin whichβ∼ˆ0k,β∼ˆjk,β∼ˆjjk,andβ∼ˆjwk,j,w=1,2,…,p,j≤ware triangular fuzzy numbers. The estimates of triangular fuzzy model coefficient vector,β∼ˆjk=βˆjkl,βˆjkc,βˆjku, is calculated by optimizing the following least squares problem with respect to Diamond's distance metric [25](7)minϕβ˜=∑k=1rdD2Y˜k,Y∼ˆkAccording to the linear operation properties of triangular fuzzy numbers and assuming that the (X′X) is nonsingular, the elements of fuzzy model coefficient vector are given in Türkşen [15] and Türkşen and Apaydın [16,17] as(8)βˆkl=(X′X)−1X′Yklβˆkc=(X′X)−1X′Ykcβˆku=(X′X)−1X′Ykuwhere k=1, 2, …, r.Clustering analysis (CA) is one of the multivariate statistical methods used to partition unlabelled data setX={X1,X2,…,Xn}⊂ℜpinto a specified number of groups according to some similarity measures. The main purpose of CA is to assign data points (Xi=(xi1,xi2,…,xip),i=1,2,…,n) to clusters such that data points of the same clusters are as similar as possible (homogeneity criterion), and data points of different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (heterogeneity criterion). In fact, CA methods produce the subsets of data set X and can be classified two categories according to whether the subsets produced are fuzzy or classic: (i) classic clustering, and (ii) fuzzy clustering.Classic clustering is based on classical set theory and therefore, in this method, each data point (Xi⊂ℜp,i=1,2,…,n) is assigned to only one cluster. In other words, each data point either does or does not belong to a cluster. However, fuzzy clustering allows the data points belonging two or more clusters simultaneously with different membership degrees which represent degree of belongingness a data point to corresponding cluster. While in classic clustering methods membership values have two values as 0 (does not belong to cluster) and 1(belongs to cluster), in fuzzy clustering methods, they can take all values between 0 and 1, as well. The best known fuzzy clustering algorithm is fuzzy C-means (FCM) [26]. This algorithm is based on minimization of the following objective function(9)J(U,X,V)=∑s=1c∑i=1nuismd2(Xi;Vs)where c is the number of clusters, n is the number of observations, U is a matrix consisted of membership degrees,V=(V1,V2,…,Vc)⊂ℜpis a vector of cluster centers and d2(Xi; Vs) is Euclidian distance. By setting the gradients of J(U, X, V) with respect to U, V to zero, update equations for uisandVs⊂ℜpare obtained as follows(10)uis=∑a=1cd2(Xi;Vs)d2(Xi;Va)1/(m−1)−1,i=1,2,…,n,s=1,2,…,c(11)vsj=∑i=1n(uis)mxij∑i=1n(uis)m,s=1,2,…,c,j=1,2,…,pwhere p is the number of input variables, m∈[1, ∞) is fuzziness index and very important parameter for FCM. The FCM is an iterative algorithm. In the beginning of the algorithm, the initial values of the tunable parameters such as number of clusters, fuzziness index, termination criteria, and cluster centers are defined. In the second step, membership degrees of the data points are computed by using previous cluster centers. And then, the cluster centers are computed according to the new membership degrees matrix. Algorithm is continued until the difference of membership degrees matrix between two successive iterations is lower than termination criteria. The steps of the algorithm are summarized in Table 3.The algorithmic steps of the FCM can be diversified by using different similarity measures and cluster centers as in the studies of Gustafson and Kessel (GK) [27], Gath and Geva [28], and Hathaway and Bezdek [29].In classical regression analyses, one assumes that there is a single functional relationship between response variable (Y) and input variables (Xj, j=1, 2, …, p). But, in the event of data set form by two and more distributions, explaining relationship between variables with a single model gives no reasonable prediction results. In such cases, one can benefit from switching regression models. Switching regression model simply can be explained as follows:(12)yi=xiβ1+ε1iwith the probabilityλ,i=1,2,…,nyi=xiβ2+ε2iwith the probability(1−λ),i=1,2,…,nwhere n is the number of observations,λ,β1,β2,ε1i,ε2iare unknown coefficients and it is assumed to generate each yifrom xiby region 1 with probability λ and by region 2 with probability 1−λ[30]. In multi-response experiments with replicated response measures, it can be regarded that each response corresponds to one region and each response belongs to all regions with different probabilities such that the sum of these probabilities is equal to 1. Here, regions correspond to the models in Eq. (12) and coefficients βs, s=1, 2, …, c (c is the number of regions) of models can be estimated by mixture distributions, fuzzy modeling, and SFCR [29]. In this study, the SFCR is used to model the multi-response experiment data set with replicated response measures for the first time. The reason is that the SFCR has an ability of identifying the regions and probabilities (λ) simultaneously. The SFCR is a very simple algorithm to find a model for each region. Besides, the SFCR annihilates the uncertainty about the prediction process since it provides a single prediction value for each observation thanks to switching property. In fact, the SFCR is a fuzzy clustering algorithm that its centers can be described as polynomial function (regression model) such as linear, quadratic, cubic etc. The objective function of the SFCR, wanted to be minimized, is given as(13)J(X,U,β)=∑s=1c∑i=1nuism(yi−fs(Xi;βs,βss,βsa))where m is fuzziness index, c is the number of clusters, n is the number of observations, yiis ith response, and uisis membership degree of i. observation to s. cluster. fs(Xi, βs, βss, βsa) can be described as second order response function as below(14)fs(Xi;βs,βss,βsa)=βs0+∑j=1pβsjxij+∑j=1pβssjxij2+∑j=1p∑j<wpβsjwxijxiwwhere i=1, 2, …, n*q, j=1, 2, …, p. βs=[βs, βss, βsa], s=1, 2, …, c can be obtained as a solution of the weighted least squares given in below(15)βs=[X1WsX1]−1X1TWsYin which X1 is the second order polynomial response function arranged as(16)Here, n indicates the number of observations and q indicates the number of replicated measures. The observed response vector Y is defined as below(17)Y=[Y11Y21…Yn1Y12Y22…Yn2…Y1qY2q…Ynxq]TThe diagonal matrix Wsin Eq. (15) is defined as(18)Ws=u1s0⋯00u2s⋯0⋮⋮⋮00u(n*q)xs,s=1,2,…,cThe SFCR is carried out through an iterative optimization of the objective function given in Eq. (13) with the update of the coefficient vectors computed in Eq. (15) and membership degree uisdefined as:(19)uis=1∑a=1c((yi−fs(Xi;βs,βss,βsj)))2/(yi−fa(Xi;βa,βaa,βaj))2),i=1,2,…,n*q,s=1,2,…,c.In the SFCR, predicted response values are calculated as follows(20)yˆi=∑s=1cuisyˆis∑s=1cuis,i=1,2,…,n*qTable 4shows the algorithmic steps of the SFCR.In Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model [31], models are established by using fuzzy expressions and IF–THEN fuzzy rules.

These data sets are Pignatiello's data set [36], colloidal gas aphrons (CGA) study data set [37], and wheel cover component data set [38]. Throughout the work, it is assumed that the responses are uncorrelated for each data set. In order to evaluate the relative performances of the three fuzzy modeling methods for the preferred data sets, root mean square error (RMSE) criteria is used, given as(30)RMSE=1n∑k=1ndk21/2=1n∑k=1nYk−Yˆk21/2.It should be noted that the observed and predicted response values are triangular fuzzy numbers in FLSR model. In this case, the distance between observed and predicted fuzzy values are calculated by using vertex method formulated as following(31)dVY˜k,Y∼ˆk=13Ykl−Yˆkl2+Ykc−Yˆkc2+Yku−Yˆku21/2.The Eq. (31), which is crisp valued, is used as nominator of Eq. (30) during the calculations for FLSR. The calculations of FLSR coefficient estimation were conducted in MATLAB 7.9. Algorithms of SFCR and TS fuzzy model were implemented in DELPHI 7 program.Example 1Pignatiello's data setPignatiello data set [36], includes two response variables (Y1,Y2) and three input variables (X1,X2,X3) with eight observations. It is assumed that the target values of responses are 103 and 73 and the specification limits are (97,109), (70,76) for (Y1,Y2) respectively and the responses are uncorrelated. It was agreed that a simultaneous maximization of Y1 and Y2 would be desirable. The experiment was conducted in a full factorial design and each response was replicated four times at each experiment condition. The experimental data set is given in Table 6and it should be noted that the input variables are given in coded values.In order to model the data set, given in Table 6, by using FLSR, the replicated responses are transformed to triangular fuzzy numbers as defined in Eq. (3). The fuzzified values of the responses are given in Table 7.The triangular fuzzy model coefficients are estimated by using Eq. (8). The number of clusters, c, is taken to be 4 since the replicated number of the responses is 4 for both Y1 and Y2. In addition, the FCM algorithm is used to obtain membership degrees given in Eqs. (25) and (26) for TS fuzzy model. The obtained predicted fuzzy regression models for the first and second responses are given in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. In Tables 8 and 9,Yˆk(t)denotes the kth predicted response with tth replication, k=1, 2, t=1, 2, 3, 4.The evaluated values of RMSE are given in Table 10for the Pignatiello's data set.It can be said from Table 10 that SFCR and TS fuzzy model have small RMSE values rather than FLSR for both responses. However, SFCR has the smallest RMSE values for both responses. The SFCR gives the best prediction results with 0.014 and 0.033 values for Y1 and Y2, respectively.A real problem with multiple responses reported in chemical engineering literature, called colloidal gas aphrons (CGA) [37], is employed to demonstrate the use of proposed fuzzy modeling approaches. The properties of the CGA are measured by three different responses which are stability (Y1), volumetric ratio (Y2), and temperature (Y3). The responses, Y1, Y2, and Y3, are wanted to be maximized, minimized, and obtaining target value, respectively. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effects of surfactant (X1), concentration of salt (X2), and time of stirring (X3) on the CGA properties. The experiment was conducted in a central composite design with eight factorial points, six axial points, and a center point. The center point was replicated six times and other design points were replicated twice [38]. The experimental data set is given in Table 11with coded input variables.In order to model the CGA data set by using FLSR, the responses are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers. The data set with fuzzy responses is given in Table A1 in Appendix A. The number of clusters, c; fuzziness index, m and termination criteria, ɛ are taken to be 2, 1.2, and 0.00001, respectively. The predicted fuzzy regression models for the first and second responses are given in Tables A2 and A3 in Appendix A, respectively. The evaluated values of RMSE are given in Table 12for the CGA study data set.It can be concluded from Table 12 that all fuzzy modeling approaches give small RMSE values. Besides, it can be seen from Table 12 that the SFCR has the smallest RMSE values for Y1 and Y2, 0.25 and 0.0385, respectively.The purpose of the wheel cover component data set, conducted in [39], is to determine the effects of seven injection molding parameters (denoted as X1, X2, …, X7) on the quality characteristics of the component. These are measured by the total weight (Y1 in grams) and the balance (Y2 in inch-ounces) [40]. The specification limits of the Y1 and Y2 are (710, 715) and (0.3, 0.4), respectively. The experiment was conducted in a 27−4 fractional factorial design with five replications in each run. The two levels of each Xi, i=1, 2, …, 7 are coded as −1 and +1 [38]. The experimental data set is given in Table 13.The data set with triangular fuzzy responses is given in Table A4 in Appendix A. The algorithmic parameters of SFCR are taken as c=2, m=1.2, and ɛ=0.00001 for bothY1andY2. In TS fuzzy model, as well as c=2 and ɛ=0.00001 for both responses, the fuzziness index, m, is chosen different for the first and second responses, 2 and 1.23, respectively. The predicted fuzzy response models are presented in Tables A5 and A6. The RMSE values of the responses are given in Table 14for the wheel cover component data set. It can be seen from Table 14 that the fuzzy modeling approaches give small RMSE values for both Y1 and Y2. Furthermore, it can be easily seen from Table 14 that the TS fuzzy model has the largest RMSE value, 98.94, for the first response. In accordance with the results in Table 14, the SFCR is the most preferable than the FLSR and TS fuzzy model.
