A version of the integrable problem of motion of a dynamically symmetric gyrostat about a fixed point similar to the Kowalevski top, while acted upon by a combination of uniform gravity and magnetic fields is considered. This version is reduced, in general, to hyperelliptic quadratures. The special case when the gyrostatic momentum is absent is solved in terms of elliptic functions of time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of motion of a heavy rigid body about a fixed point has a long history beginning with Euler's work [1]. For most of this history, the main concern of authors was to isolate cases, when the general solution of the equations of motion can be expressed explicitly in terms of functions of time, or, at least, can be reduced to quadratures. This recipe has succeeded in two cases: Euler's case of a body moving by inertia and Lagrange's case of a symmetrical top [2]. Separation of variables in Euler's case was found by Euler himself, but the solution was expressed by Jacobi in terms of his newly invented elliptic functions. Lagrange reduced the case of axisymmetric top to separation of variables involving elliptic integrals. Explicit expression of the solution in terms of time was initiated by Jacobi and can be found with some variations in [3–5].The following historical turn in rigid body dynamics came in the opposite direction, from the study of the nature of solutions of the equations of motion. Kowalevski [6] isolated the possible cases which share with Euler's and Lagrange's cases the property of having their solutions as meromorphic functions of time. It turned out that only one more case satisfies this criterion. That case became known as Kowalevski's. Kowalevski obtained the complementary integral for that case as a quartic polynomial in velocities. She also integrated the equations of motion in terms of hyperelliptic functions of time. Her solution was simplified by Kötter [7] and reconsidered by a series of authors. For a detailed history, see e.g. [8].When a uniformly rotating rotor has its axis of symmetry fixed in the rigid body, the resulting system is known as a gyrostat. For this system, the generalization of Lagrange's case and its solution was straightforward. Euler's case was generalized by Zhukovsky [9]. The corresponding solution was shown by Volterra to be expressible in terms of sigma functions of Weierstrass [10]. In [11], Wittenburg pointed out another solution in terms of elliptic functions of time. Detailed presentation of the history of general and particular solutions for a heavy gyrostat can be found in [12].A century after the discovery of Kowalevski's case, its generalization to the problem of gyrostat has been found in a different context. The problem of motion of a gyrostat similar to the Kowalevski top and acted upon by two skew uniform fields (gravity and magnetic) was considered in [13]. A general first integral quartic in velocities and generalizing the Kowalevski integral was found for this generic problem. As, in the general case, the two force fields problem does not admit a symmetry group, the additional cyclic integral does not exist. It turned out that such integral still exists in two special cases [13]. The first case generalizes Kowalevski's case of one field to the gyrostat motion in one field. The second case does not contain the classical case of Kowalevski, since the intensities of the two fields are proportional and can vanish only simultaneously. In the last case the cyclic variable is a complementary angle to the sum (or difference) of the two angles of precession and proper rotation.In the present paper we accomplish separation of variables for a version of the last case, corresponding to a special value of the cyclic constant proportional to the gyrostatic moment and singled out by the condition that the reduced system becomes time-reversible. We give two algebraic separations of variables. In the first one, the cyclic constant is supposed non-zero and the variables of separation are to be determined as functions of time by solving hyperelliptic Abel–Jacobi equations. This result is based on the analogy established in [14] (see also [15] for further generalizations) of a special class of problems of the gyrostat motion in two fields with the problems of the gyrostat motion in axially symmetric field with zero momentum constant. Thus, the first separation given below corresponds to the algebraic separation [16,17] found by the method proposed in [18,19] for the Goryachev case. This separation is not applicable if the gyrostatic moment in the initial problem is zero. Nevertheless, as it is shown in [14], the equivalent problem of the rigid body motion in an axisymmetric field is the integrable case of Chaplygin [20]. Therefore we give the second separation which transfers the elliptic separation found by Chaplygin to the two-fields problem.The two types of separation of variables accomplished here make it easy to apply the algorithm of finding the admissible regions for the integral constants and to establish the rough phase topology of the system [21,22]. Moreover, the recent results for separated systems [23] give a method to calculate the exact topological invariants of singular points and all regular iso-energy levels. This will give the complete topological analysis of the problem which will be different (as far as special types of motions are concerned) from the corresponding Goryachev and Chaplygin cases [17,24] since the analogy of these problems with the motion of a gyrostat in two fields does not give a global diffeomorphism of the corresponding phase spaces.It will also be interesting to analyze all special cases when the trajectories in reduced systems become periodic. For the Goryachev case the corresponding quadratures are found in [17]. In our problem such quadratures can lead to explicit calculation of the orientation matrix and therefore provide the analytical basis for the geometric interpretation of periodic and two-frequency motions of the considered gyrostat in two fields.The equation of the motion of a gyrostat acted upon by two homogeneous fields in the general case can be written in the Euler – Poisson form(1)M˙=M×ω+c1×α+c2×β,α˙=α×ω,β˙=β×ω.Hereωis the angular velocity,αandβare the characteristic vectors of the force fields (say, the vectors of the gravity force and of the magnetic field strength),c1,c2are the vectors pointing from the fixed point O to the centers of the fields application. All objects are referred to some moving axes. The kinetic momentum vectorMis connected with the angular velocity by the relationM=ωI+λ,whereIandλare the inertia tensor at O and the gyrostatic momentum vector. BothIandλare constant in the moving frame. We consider the components of all vectors as rows, thus obtaining the unusual order of the objects in the above expression forM.It is known [8] that without changing the planeOc1c2in the body, one can make the pair of the vectorsc1,c2to be orthonormal. Let us choose the moving frameOe1e2e3of the principal axes of the inertia tensor. Suppose that the gyrostat is dynamically symmetrice1I⋅e1=e2I⋅e2,λ={0,0,λ}and the centers of the fields application lie in the equatorial planec1⋅e3=0,c2⋅e3=0. In this case (see [25,26]) by some linear change of variables one can make the immovable in space vectorsα,βto be mutually orthogonal. Then, after the pairc1,c2is made orthonormal, the modules of the vectorsα,βcontain all scalar information on the interaction of the gyrostat with the fields (e.g. for the gravity field, the module of the corresponding vector is equal to the product of the gyrostat weight and the distance from the mass center to the fixed point). Therefore, we callαandβthe intensities of the force fields. In the case of dynamic symmetry any orthonormal pair in the equatorial plane becomes principal for the inertia tensor, so we takee1=c1,e2=c2.In what follows, we assume that the inertia tensor satisfies the Kowalevski conditions(2)I=diag{I1,I1,I3},I1=I2=2I3and the intensities of the orthogonalized fields are equal(3)α2=β2=a2,α·β=0(a>0).We also choose the dimension units in such a way thatI3=1.Note that introducing dimensionless variables we can also obtaina=1. Still, we keep the inessential parameter a for a possibility to pass to the limit casea=0, and also for better control on the dimensions of expressions in the obtained formulas.As shown in [13], under conditions (2), (3) in addition to the energy integralH=ω12+ω22+12ω32−α1−β2Equation (1) have the first integrals(4)K=(ω12−ω22+α1−β2)2+(2ω1ω2+α2+β1)2+2λ[(ω3−λ)(ω12+ω22)+2(α3ω1+β3ω2)],G=2ω1γ1+2ω2γ2+(ω3+λ)(γ3−a).Here the vectorγ=a−1α×βaugments the pairα,βto form a fixed in space orthogonal basis normalized by the value a. In particular, the matrix of direction cosines isQ=1a(αβγ).Let us consider the action onSO(3)of the subgroup{gτ}of matricesgτ=(cosτsinτ0−sinτcosτ0001)Q↦Q(τ)=gτQgτ−1.by inner automorphismsThis action is not free; the subgroup{gτ}itself is a stationary subgroup for each of its elements. Suppose that passing to the quotient space we identify the whole subgroup{gτ}to one point. Then we obtain the fiber bundle ofSO(3)over the two-dimensional sphere, but this bundle is not locally trivial [27,28]. Therefore, such symmetry is called a singular symmetry. The singular points on the quotient sphere obviously correspond to the cases(5)γ=±ae3.The plus sign corresponds to the points of the subgroup{gτ}. For the minus sign the covering orbit of the action is twice shorter than all close ones.The integral G is a cyclic integral generated by the action of{gτ}. Indeed, the instant angular velocity of the rotationQ(τ)atτ=0equalsQT(0)ddτ|τ=0Q(τ)=1a(γ−ae3)=1a(γ1,γ2,γ3−a),therefore, G is, up to the constant multipliera,the corresponding momentum integral.We introduce the Euler anglesθ,φ,ψ(0⩽θ⩽π,0⩽φ⩽2π,0⩽ψ⩽2π), supposing θ is the angle betweenγande3:α1=a(cosφcosψ−sinφsinψcosθ),α2=−a(sinφcosψ+cosφsinψcosθ),α3=asinψsinθ,β1=a(cosφsinψ+sinφcosψcosθ),β2=−a(sinφsinψ−cosφcosψcosθ),β3=−acosψsinθ,γ1=asinφsinθ,γ2=acosφsinθ,γ3=acosθ,ω1=ψ˙sinφsinθ+θ˙cosφ,ω2=ψ˙cosφsinθ−θ˙sinφ,ω3=φ˙+ψ˙cosθ.The Lagrange function for the system (1) isL=12φ˙2+θ˙2+14(3−cos2θ)ψ˙2+φ˙ψ˙cosθ+λ(φ˙+ψ˙cosθ)+acos(φ+ψ)(1+cosθ).Remark 1. The points (5) correspond to the valuesθ=0andθ=π, i.e. to the case(6)sinθ=0.We shall consider only those solutions of the system (1) which do not cross the set of the phase space satisfying (6).We will now introduce a change of variablesφ=Φ−Ψ,ψ=Ψ,θ=2Θ.ThenΘ∈[0,π/2], and the anglesΦ,Ψcan be taken to vary on the segment[0,2π], since the change(φ,ψ)↦(Φ,Ψ)is given by the integer matrix with determinant 1. Obviously,Ψis a cyclic coordinate corresponding to the integral G. In the new variables, this integral isG=a∂L∂Ψ˙=2a[(3+cos2Θ)Ψ˙−Φ˙−λ]sin2Θ.It is natural to denote its constant by2ag. From the equation of the cyclic integral we findΨ˙=(Φ˙+λ)sin2Θ+gDsin2Θ.Here we denoteD=3+cos2Θ=2(2−sin2Θ).Eliminating the cyclic coordinate we construct the RouthianR=Θ˙2+cos2Θ2DΦ˙2+2λcos2Θ−g2DΦ˙+a2cosΦcos2Θ−(g+λsin2Θ)24Dsin2Θ.Note that the solutions crossing the set (6) indeed need some special consideration since the valuessinΘ=0andcosΘ=0cause obvious singularities either in the potential or in the kinetic energy of the reduced system.The term linear inΦ˙does not affect the Lagrange equations if0≡∂∂Θ(2λcos2Θ−g2D)=−2λ+g2D2sin2Θ,i.e. for the value(7)g=−2λ.In the sequel we shall consider only this case. Under condition (7), the reduced system is a natural mechanical system with(8)R=Θ˙2+cos2Θ2DΦ˙2+a2cosΦcos2Θ−λ24sin2Θ.ForΘandΦ, we have the pair of differential equationsΦ¨=4tanΘDΦ˙Θ˙−aDsinΦ2,Θ¨=−sin2Θ2D2Φ˙2+14(λ2cosΘsin3Θ−acosΦsin2Θ).The cyclic variable is obtained by integrating the equation forΨ˙(9)Ψ˙=Φ˙D−λ2sin2Θ,It is known that in the corresponding problem of the dynamics of a rigid body in one axially symmetric force field [29] there exists a separation of variables. One of the possible ways to obtain a separation was pointed out in [30]. Complete real algebraic separation for the Goryachev case was given in [16,17]. Here we give a real separation for the gyrostat in the double field with singular symmetry under condition (7).It is convenient to pass fromH,Kto the “shifted” first integralsH˜=14(H+λ22),K˜=14(K+2λ2H)We denote by h and k the corresponding integral constants. In explicit form we haveH˜=Θ˙2+cos2Θ2DΦ˙2−a2cosΦcos2Θ+λ24sin2Θ,K˜=4Θ˙4+sin42Θ4D4Φ˙4+2sin22ΘD2Φ˙2Θ˙2+8asinΦcosΘsin3ΘDΦ˙Θ˙+2[λ2sin2Θ+2acosΦsin2Θ]Θ˙2+2cos2ΘD2[λ2−2acosΦsin4Θ]Φ˙2+λ44sin4Θ+a2sin4Θ.Now we formulate the main result. Define the variablesz1,z2as the roots of the quadratic equationz2sin2Θ−λ2z+2λ2(Θ˙2+sin22Θ4D2Φ˙2)−ksin2Θ+λ42sin2Θ=0and introduce the following two-valued ramified functions ofz1andz2(10)p1=k+aλ2−z12,q1=z12−k+aλ2,r1=z1(z1−λ2)+2λ2h−k,p2=k+aλ2−z22,q2=k−aλ2−z22,r2=z2(λ2−z2)−2λ2h+k.Theorem 1. On common levels of the integralsH˜=h,K˜=kthe anglesΘ,Φare expressed via the variablesz1,z2by the formulas(11)sinΘ=λz1+z2,cosΘ=z1+z2−λ2z1+z2,sinΦ2=p2q1r1+p1q2r2λ2a(z1−z2)z1+z2z1+z2−λ2,cosΦ2=p1q2r1−p2q1r2λ2a(z1−z2)z1+z2z1+z2−λ2,and the dependency ofz1,z2on time is described by the following differential equations(12)λ(z2−z1)z˙1=Z(z1),λ(z2−z1)z˙2=Z(z2),whereZ(z)is a polynomial of degree six defined asZ(z)=[a2λ4−(k−z2)2][z(z−λ2)+2λ2h−k].Remark 2. The differential equations for the auxiliary variables can obviously be written in the form of Abel–Jacobi equationsdz1Z(z1)−dz2Z(z2)=0,z1dz1Z(z1)−z2dz2Z(z2)=−1λdt.Solutions can be expressed in hyperelliptic functions of time.Remark 3. In the above notation we consider the radicalsz1+z2−λ2andz1+z2to be always positive. Indeed, it follows from the definition ofz1,z2thatz1+z2⩾λ2>0. But the casez1+z2=λ2givescosΘ=0. Such solutions are excluded according to Remark 1. Thus, these radicals (and obviously the constant2a>0) do not generate multiple values in (11). On the contrary, if we fix some rectangle of oscillation of the separation variablesz1,z2in such a way that the expressions (11) are all real, then some of the radicals (10) periodically change their signs. In formulas (10), (11), where for consistency we must chooseZ(z1)=p1q1r1andZ(z2)=p2q2r2, we can make any formal substitution of the typepi→−piorqi→−qi, thus obtaining a completely equivalent form of the algebraic solution.The expression forsinΘ,cosΘfollow straightforwardly from the definition of the auxiliary variables, according to which(13)z1+z2=λ2sin2Θ.Taking into account thatz1z2=2λ2sin2Θ(Θ˙2+sin22Θ4D2Φ˙2)−k−λ42sin4Θwe find(14)1sin2Θ(Θ˙2+sin22Θ4D2Φ˙2)=2k−(z12+z22)4λ2.To simplify the calculation let us introduce the variable V by putting(15)Θ˙=V2z1+z2.Then eliminatingΘfrom (13), (14), we obtain(16)Φ˙=[λ2−2(z12+z22)]2k−(z12+z22)−V2λz1+z2z1+z2−λ2.Substitution of the found expressions forsinΘ,cosΘ,Θ˙,Φ˙into the equations of the first integrals gives two equations to determine V andcosΦas the functions ofz1,z2:4a2λ4V4+4aλ2{λ2(z12+z22−2k)+[(k−z12)(k−z22)+λ4]cosΦ}V2+[k2+a2λ4+z12z22+aλ2(z12+z22)cosΦ−k(2aλ2cosΦ+z12+z22)]2=0,(z1+z2−λ2)(V2+aλ2cosΦ)+k[λ2−2(z1+z2)]+2hλ2(z1+z2)+z14−z24z1−z2−λ2z13−z23z1−z2=0.Whence,(17)V2=[(z1+z2−λ2)(z1−z2)2(z1+z2)]−1{2p1q1r1p2q2r2+2k3−k2[λ2(4h−z1−z2)+3(z12+z22)]+k[3(z14+z24)+4hλ2(z12+z22)−2λ2(z13+z23)−2a2λ4]+a2λ6(4h−z1−z2)+a2λ4(z12+z22)+λ2[z15+z25−2h(z14+z24)]−(z16+z26)},cosΦ=[(z1+z2−λ2)(z1−z2)2(z1+z2)]−1−{2p1q1r1p2q2r2+[a2λ4−(k−z12)(k−z22)]2k−λ2(4h−z1−z2)−(z12+z22)}.Let us calculate12(1+cosΦ),12(1−cosΦ)andV2. It is possible to avoid double radicals in the resulting formulas by obvious identityA+2B=12(A+C+A−C),C=A2−4B,if C is a whole expression (see Chaplygin's techniques in [20]). Applying this to (17), we obtain the sine and cosine of the half-angle in the form (11), while for V we get(18)V=p1q1r1+p2q2r2(z1−z2)z1+z2z1+z2−λ2.Note that at this point we can choose arbitrary formal signs at these values since onlycos2Θ,V2, andcosΦare uniquely defined as the functions ofzi,pi,qi,ri. But the choice of signs now made determine all choices of signs in the consequent expressions (see Remark 3 above).Substituting (18) for V in (15), (16) we findΘ˙,Φ˙in terms ofz1,z2,(19)Θ˙=p1q1r1+p2q2r22(z12−z22)z1+z2−λ2,Φ˙=[2(z1+z2)−λ2](p1q1r2−p2q2r1)λ(z12−z22)(z1+z2−λ2).On the other hand, considering the operatorDt=z˙1∂z1+z˙2∂z2of the complete time derivative of a function ofz1,z2, we calculate from Equations (11)(20)Θ˙=DtsinΘcosΘ,Φ˙=2DtsinΦ2cosΦ2.EliminatingΘ˙,Φ˙in (19) and (20) gives the system of equations linear inz˙1,z˙2,C1z˙1+C2z˙2+[2(z1+z2)−λ2](p1q1r2−p2q2r1)λ=0,z˙1+z˙2+p1q1r1+p2q2r2λ(z1−z2)=0.HereC1=r2r1(2z1−λ2)(z1+z2)−2z1(z1+z2−λ2)p2q2p1q1,C2=r1r2(2z2−λ2)(z1+z2)−2z2(z1+z2−λ2)p1q1p2q2.Solving this system we come to Equation (12).Thus, in the reduced system under the condition (7) on the cyclic constant and the gyrostatic momentum we obtain the separation of variables and express the trigonometric functions of non-cyclic angles as rational expressions in the basic radicals (10) with coefficients defined by one-valued functions of the separation variables. For the cyclic coordinate (the angleΨ) the generalized velocity can be presented in the same form. Indeed, from (9) in virtue of the formulas obtained forΘ˙,Φ˙we getΨ˙=−12λ[(z1+z2)+p2q2r1−p1q1r2(z1+z2−λ2)(z1−z2)].After integrating differential Equation (12), we find the right-hand side as a function of time.To conclude this section let us make one interesting observation. Having in mind the topological analysis of the problem, one has to construct the so-called bifurcation set of the first integrals. Such set is the part of the discriminant setΔof the polynomialZ(z)in the right-hand side of separated Equation (12) corresponding to real motions. It is easy to show that the setΔafter the normalizationa=1and the shiftk′=k−λ2turns into the set bearing the bifurcation diagram constructed in [31] for another integrable case of Chaplygin also found in [20] and defined by the Hamiltonian(21)H=12(ω12+ω22+12ω32)+12(α12−α22)+cα1withα2=1and2c2=λ2. It was shown in [32] that the bifurcation diagram of the axisymmetric problem with the Hamiltonian (21) can be represented as the discriminant set of some polynomial. Still for this Chaplygin's case the complete algebraic separation of variables is not known. It seems likely that such a separation can be obtained based on the obvious analogy between the two problems.The above separation, obviously, takes place only for the caseλ≠0. In particular, there is no analog for this solution for the two-fields Kowalevski top in theS1-symmetric case. Nevertheless, whenλ=0(and then alsog=0in virtue of the condition (7)) the Routhian (8) and the first integrals do not have singular terms on the(Θ,Φ)-sphere. It is shown in [14] (see also [27]), that such problem has an analogy with Chaplygin's solution of the problem of motion of a body in a liquid under the Kowalevski conditionI1=I2=2I3[20]. We now transfer the results of Chaplygin's classical work [20] to the case under consideration of two fields.DenoteΩ=ω12+ω22,ϰ=k.The latter notation is possible since forλ=0the integral K in (4) is the sum of two squares and, consequently, the integralK˜is non-negative. Let us introduce the variablesτ1,τ2similar to the separated variables of Chaplygin putting(22)τ1=12asin2Θ(Ω+2ϰ),τ2=12asin2Θ(Ω−2ϰ).Let(23)P1=τ1+1,Q1=τ1−1,R1=aτ1−ϰ−2h,P2=1+τ2,Q2=1−τ2,R2=2h−ϰ−aτ2.Theorem 2. On common levels of the integralsH˜=h,K˜=ϰ2the anglesΘ,Φare expressed in terms of the variablesτ1,τ2by the formulas(24)sinΘ=2ϰa(τ1−τ2),cosΘ=a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰa(τ1−τ2),sinΦ2=P2Q1R1+P1Q2R22(τ1−τ2)a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ,cosΦ2=P1Q2R1−P2Q1R22(τ1−τ2)a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ,The corresponding generalized velocities have the form(25)Θ˙=ϰ2(τ1−τ2)a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ(P1Q1R1+P2Q2R2),Φ˙=2[a(τ1−τ2)−ϰ](τ1−τ2)[a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ](P1Q1R2−P2Q2R1),and the dependency ofτ1,τ2on time is described by the following differential equations(26)τ˙1=−U1(τ1),τ˙2=U2(τ2),whereU1(τ1)=(τ12−1)(aτ1−ϰ−2h),U2(τ2)=(1−τ22)(2h−ϰ−aτ2).The expression forΨis obtained by integrating the relationΨ˙=Φ˙D=a2[a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ](P1Q1R2−P2Q2R1),Remark 4. The general solution of Equation (26) is obtained by inverting the following elliptic integrals(27)−∫τ1dτ1(τ12−1)(aτ1−ϰ−2h)=t=∫τ2dτ2(1−τ22)(2h−ϰ−aτ2).The explicit expressions in the Jacobi functions depend on the chosen intervals of oscillation of the variablesτ1,τ2. The possible intervals are defined by the condition that the values (24) and (25) should be real.In (26), we must chooseU1(τ1)=P1Q1R1andU2(τ2)=P2Q2R2. As in the previous case (see Remark 3), in formulas (24), (25), and (26), we can make any formal substitution of the typePi→−PiorQi→−Qi, thus obtaining a completely equivalent form of the algebraic solution. Our choice was made to have the combinations of the basic radicals in (24), (25) similar to those in (10), (11). This choice gave the minus sign in the first Equation (26) and at the first integral in (27).Proof. From (22),(28)Ω=2ϰτ1+τ2τ1−τ2,sin2Θ=2ϰa(τ1−τ2).The second equation defines the expressions forsinΘ,cosΘ. Calculate the valueΩin the angle variables,(29)Ω=4Θ˙2+sin22Θ(3+cos2Θ)2Φ˙2.As before, let us introduce an auxiliary variable V,(30)Θ˙=ϰV2a(τ1−τ2).Then from (28), (29) we get(31)Φ˙=−2[a(τ1−τ2)−ϰ]a(τ1+τ2)−V2a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰa(τ1−τ2).The equations of the first integrals give(32)[a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ](V2+acosΦ)−a[a(τ1−τ2)−ϰ](τ1+τ2)+2ah(τ1−τ2)=0,4V4+4a[(1+τ1τ2)cosΦ−(τ1+τ2)]V2+a2[(1+τ1τ2)−(τ1+τ2)cosΦ]2=0.Hence we write(33)cosΦ=(τ1−τ2)−1[a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ]−1{[a(τ1+τ2)−4h](1−τ1τ2)−2P1Q1R1P2Q2R2},V2=(τ1−τ2)−1[a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ]−1a{a[τ1(τ12−1)−τ2(1−τ22)]−2h(τ12+τ22−2)−ϰ(τ12−τ22)+2P1Q1R1P2Q2R2}.Having chosen at this moment one of the possible solutions of system (32), we thus have determined the formal choice of the signs of the two-valued radicals (23) in the following expressions of the phase variables. The radicals themselves can have any sign on a trajectory (moreover, some of them change the sign periodically) but the formal expressions must be consistent. The first equation in (33) leads to the formulas for the sine and cosine of the half-angle as in (24). From the second one we findV=a(P1Q1R1+P2Q2R2)τ1−τ2a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ,a(τ1+τ2)−V2=a(P2Q2R1−P1Q1R2)τ1−τ2a(τ1−τ2)−2ϰ.Whence, according to (30) and (31), we obtain the expressions (25) for the generalized velocities.Substituting the values (24) and (25) in (20), we come to separated Equation (26). Let us emphasize that this separation is elliptic with polynomial of degree 3 in the radicals, therefore it is complete in the sense that both Equation (26) are integrated independently of each other. Of course, the solutions can be easily written out in Jacobi functions.Finally, we findΨ˙from (9) by puttingλ=0.This completes the expressions forΘ,Θ˙,Φ,Φ˙,Ψ˙as elliptic functions of time.
