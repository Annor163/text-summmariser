@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The liquid crystal mixture E7, based on cyanobiphenyl, has been successfully employed to map electric field strength and distribution in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. Using a transmitted light image through crossed polarizers the optical response of the liquid crystal deposited onto the surface of the devices was recorded as a function of source–drain bias, Vds. At a critical voltage of 4V the preferred direction of orientation of the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules in the drain access region aligned with one of the polarizers resulting in reduced transmitted light intensity. This indicates that at this electric field strength molecule orientation in most of the liquid crystal film is dominated by the electric field effect rather than the influence of surface anchoring. The experimental results were compared to device simulations. Electric field strength above the surface at Vds=4V was simulated to reach or exceed 0.006MV/cm. This electric field is consistent with the field expected for E7 to overcome internal elastic energy. This result illustrates the usefulness of liquid crystals to directly determine and map electric fields in electronic devices, including small electric field strengths.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have been the focus of intensive research to deliver improved device reliability in recent years [1]. Their wide bandgap makes them an excellent candidate for high power applications giving improved performance in power-supplies as well as radar or satellite systems. Many aspects of the reliability and operation of these devices are still not very well understood or solved, including the underlying physics of electronic trapping sites within the bulk of the devices [2,3] or within surface leakage paths [4]. In addition, the physical origin of device degradation during operation is still controversial [5,6]. Devices exhibit high internal electric fields and high channel temperatures, well in excess of traditional semiconductor device systems. These can trigger degradation and generation of electronic traps [7]. Investigation techniques employed have included electrical methods [8,9] such as pulsed IV or transient analysis [10,11] as well as optical methods such as electroluminescence [12]. These traps impact device performance including a reduction in source–drain current or can lead to higher leakage currents along interfaces and at the device surface. Typically field plates or gate shaping are used to limit the maximum electric field present in the devices [7]. While accessing temperature in the devices is nowadays easily possible for example using Raman, infra-red or liquid crystal thermography [13–15], quantifying experimentally peak electric fields that drive electronic trap generation and device degradation is challenging. Past efforts have used Kelvin probe force microscopy [16] as well as depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectra [17] to try to correlate local electric field strength with degradation phenomena due to material defects and stress-induced traps. While liquid crystals have been used in the past to image temperature distribution and hot spots in the devices [18] their potential to image electric fields in electronic devices has been ignored to date. This is despite their wide scale use in displays that exploit their orientation under an electric field [19]. Several different phases of low or high order can be achieved in a liquid crystal depending on temperature or the presence of external electric fields [20]. In this work it is demonstrated that liquid crystal can be used for electric field analysis of electronic devices, on the example of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. This is done by using their ability to orientate with electric field lines in the nematic phase rather than exploiting a phase change.HEMTs fabricated from a 25nm AlGaN barrier on a 1.9μm thick GaN layer grown on an insulating SiC substrate were studied. The devices were passivated with 325nm of Si3N4. Si3N4 is a commonly used layer in the devices to control traps at the surface and device leakage currents [21]. This entire material stack is transparent under white light illumination, apart from areas covered by metal contacts. Source–gate spacing and drain–gate spacing were 1μm and 2.4μm, respectively, with a gate length of 0.6μm and a gate width of 100μm. Liquid crystal of type E7 were deposited on the HEMT device surface with E7 containing 51% 5CB (cyanobiphenyl), 25% 7CB (cyanobiphenyl), 16% 8OCB (octyloxy-cyanobiphenyl) and 8% 5CT (cyanoterphenyl) [22]. The individual molecules within the mixture have lengths of around 2nm and demonstrate the nematic phase at a temperature of up to 58°C. Even though the individual molecules are disordered in the nematic phase, the long axes (as illustrated in Fig. 1C) have a preferred direction. This direction is represented by the director and the material is birefringent. [23] The devices were operated up to a source–drain voltage of 20V with a gate bias of −6V. Operating the device under pinch off conditions avoids any significant heating effects. Gate leakage current in the device considered here was less than 0.3mA/mm. The devices were imaged using an optical microscope with a 50x, 0.7 numerical aperture objective, under crossed polarizers with backlight white illumination to record the optical response of the liquid crystal molecules under the electric field in the devices. A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. For the deposition of the liquid crystal on the AlGaN/GaN HEMT, it is important to achieve a thin layer to avoid convective instabilities [23], which may be caused by temperature or leakage currents. On the other hand, a thin layer on the scale of the dimensions of the liquid crystal molecules would result in alignment dominated by the surface structure or the homeotropic anchoring at the air–liquid crystal interface. For best results a layer below 10μm was applied, which was found to be thin enough to avoid convective instabilities. This was achieved by applying a droplet of liquid crystal using a needle with the liquid crystal flowing onto the surface of the device due to surface tension, rather than spin-coating. This thickness is consistent with commercially used liquid crystal films for displays [19].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A method to map electric fields and determine electric field strength in electronic semiconductor devices, liquid crystal electrography, was developed. Use of liquid crystals under crossed polarizers can be employed to determine bias voltages that result in critical electric field strengths at the device surface. Even small field strengths can be detected with this method. This was illustrated on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs passivated with Si3N4. The electric field on the Si3N4 surface affects the alignment of a thin film of liquid crystal molecules by orientating the director with the electric field.
