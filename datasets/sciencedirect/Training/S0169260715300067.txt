@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To determine initial velocities of enzyme catalyzed reactions without theoretical errors it is necessary to consider the use of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation. When the reaction product is an inhibitor, this approach is particularly important. Nevertheless, kinetic studies usually involved the evaluation of other inhibitors beyond the reaction product. The occurrence of these situations emphasizes the importance of extending the integrated Michaelis–Menten equation, assuming the simultaneous presence of more than one inhibitor because reaction product is always present. This methodology is illustrated with the reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase inhibited by phosphate (reaction product, inhibitor 1) and urea (inhibitor 2). The approach is explained in a step by step manner using an Excel spreadsheet (available as a template in Appendix). Curve fitting by nonlinear regression was performed with the Solver add-in (Microsoft Office Excel). Discrimination of the kinetic models was carried out based on Akaike information criterion. This work presents a methodology that can be used to develop an automated process, to discriminate in real time the inhibition type and kinetic constants as data (product vs. time) are achieved by the spectrophotometer.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The usual determination of initial velocities by drawing a tangent line to the reaction curve is theoretically incorrect since the substrate decrease and potential inhibitory reaction products accumulate. As previously explained there is an incompatibility between the kinetic data and the underlying model [1]. To avoid this incompatibility the model must be integrated to give a description of the reaction progress. Another possibility is to differentiate the data (determining rates) nevertheless if an appropriated kinetic model for a given enzyme reaction is not known, determination of initial velocities is not theoretically accurate. Thus the kinetic studies must evolve by the use of the integrated Michaelis–Menten equations even if only for determination of initial velocities [2,3].The integrated Michaelis–Menten equation in its classical implicit form [4,5] or in its explicit form [6] have other advantages: (i) the initial addition of a product inhibitor can be eliminated and Kievaluated [7–10] allowing for example to determine inhibition constants, of a particular reaction product isomer, more accurately since they are based on correct stereochemistry and complete purity [11]; (ii) the possibility to determine the inhibition constants without knowledge of true substrate concentration [9,12,13]. This is of special mention in heterogeneous reactions where the substrate is insoluble.One of the main caveats regarding the use of integrated Michaelis–Menten equation to entire progress curve analysis is the possibility of gradual enzyme activity loss under the assay conditions. However, nothing prevents its use with much lower percent substrate depletion [2,5,10]. Thus, in this work integrated equations will be applied only to data points usually utilized to determine initial velocities (up to 10% substrate depletion).The integrated Michaelis–Menten equations have not been usually applied in the presence of two inhibitors in the reaction medium. Nevertheless, integrated equations find special interest in studies with two different inhibitors since product inhibition is often found as a common regulating enzyme mechanism [4,9,14–17]. Thus, to study the inhibition kinetics of this kind of enzymes it is necessary to consider the simultaneous presence of two inhibitors because one of them is a reaction product (it is always present). The main objective of this work is to develop and apply integrated equations to the kinetic analysis of reactions carried out in the presence of two inhibitors when one of them is a reaction product whether or not mutually exclusive.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This work put in evidence that integrated Michaelis–Menten equation is a powerful methodology for the analysis of enzyme reactions even in the presence of two inhibitors being one of them a reaction product. The methodology can be used with only limited data points usually utilized to determine initial velocities. The possibility of utilizing this methodology to determine kinetic constants in general kinetic studies and the possibility of developing spectrophotometer software to indicate “on line” and in real time the type of inhibition and kinetic constants is important to point out.None.
