@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a modeling technique for the QRS complex based on the fractional linear prediction (FLP). As a result of FLP modeling, each QRS complex is represented by a vector of three coefficients. The FLP modeling evaluation is achieved in two steps. In the first step, the ability of the FLP coefficients to efficiently model QRS complex waves is assessed by comparison with the Linear Prediction (LP) coefficients through the signal-to-error (SER) values evaluated between the original waves and predicted ones. In the second step, the performance of several classifiers is used to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of FLP modeling over LP modeling. Classifiers are fed by the three estimated coefficients in order to discriminate premature ventricular contraction (PVC) arrhythmia from normal beats. The study has successfully demonstrated that FLP modeling can be an alternative to the LP modeling in the field of QRS complex modeling.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an electrical signal generated by the heart's muscular activity recorded by electrodes placed on the body surface. Modeling is a very useful tool for depicting this electrical activity. Basically, modeling is a mathematical representation of a process, action, or an experimental outcome [1].Signal modeling is one of the most widely used techniques in the automatic ECG signal analysis. Depending on the application, there are many ways where ECG modeling is utilized, for example in noise removal, in signal compression or in features extraction for arrhythmia classification. A considerable amount of literature has been published on ECG signal modeling. In the next paragraphs we briefly present some published methods focusing on the ECG modeling techniques [2–20].In [2] authors proposed an approach based on the use of a sum of N Gaussian shapes to model the normal and the PVC beats. An ECG modeling technique based on the sequential Bayesian methods was presented in [3], the aim of the method was to effectively model and adaptively select parameters of ECG signals. The ECG signal was modeled using a parametric modeling technique based on signal dependent orthogonal transform in [4]. Numerous studies [5,6] have used Hidden Markov Model approaches for ECG signal modeling. An adaptive Hermite model estimation system was presented in [7] for on-line beat-to-beat estimation of the features that describe the QRS complex with the Hermite model. In [8] authors introduced a model-based dynamic algorithm for tracking the ECG characteristic waveforms using an extended Kalman filter. Sayadi et al. [9] presented a technique based on a modified extended Kalman filter structure for ECG signals denoising and compression. In [10] authors presented a method for morphological modeling of cardiac signals. A set of desired properties for a generic decomposition-based model was presented; the method was typically applied to the problem of ECG signal compression. In [11] authors used discrete Hermite functions for the compression of the QRS complexes. In [12] authors proposed an approach based on Generalized Orthogonal Forward Regression for ECG modeling. In [13] an ECG modeling technique using the Sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo filter that could perform simultaneous model selection have been proposed. In [14] authors proposed a method based on a dynamical model made of three coupled ordinary differential equations which was capable of generating realistic synthetic ECG signals. In [15] a method for dynamically modeling, estimating and classifying ECG signals was proposed. The key of the method was the use of the interacting multiple model framework. In [16] authors proposed an approach based on the Hilbert Transform and a low order polynomial approximation of the QRS complex waves. In [17] an integrated method for clustering of QRS complexes was presented, each QRS complex was decomposed into Hermite basis functions and the resulting coefficients and width parameter were used to represent the QRS complex. In [18] an Extended Kalman Filter was proposed for the filtering of noisy ECG signals. The method was based on a modified nonlinear dynamic model. A number of studies [19,20] also used linear prediction (LP) for ECG modeling and feature extraction.In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in fractional calculus and it has been more and more introduced into various engineering science. We can quote for example control [21], signal and image processing [22], biology [23], robotics [24], and others.Recent studies in physiological signal modeling have introduced the use of the fractional linear prediction (FLP) to model speech [25] and EEG signal [26]. Motivated by the effectiveness of the FLP method for speech and EEG signals modeling, we propose in this study to investigate this technique as a new tool for efficiently modeling ECG signals.The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLP modeling in the ECG signal modeling over linear prediction (LP) modeling, with attempt to show the utility of the extracted FLP coefficients on the discrimination and the classification of the PVC arrhythmia. To that end, a series of experiments will be done to discriminate the PVC arrhythmia from other beats. In addition, different types of classifiers for PVC discrimination will be implemented and evaluated.
