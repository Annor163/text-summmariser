@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A number of diseases including sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hyperinflammatory immune disorders have been associated with Toll like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. Endogenous adaptor protein known as MyD88 adapter-like protein (MAL) bind exclusively to the cytosolic portions of TLR2 and TLR4 to initiate downstream signalling. Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) and protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) have been implicated to phosphorylate MAL and activate it to initiate downstream signalling. BTK has been associated with phosphorylation at positions Tyr86 and Tyr106, necessary for the activation of MAL but definite residual target of PKCδ in MAL is still to be explored. To produce a better understanding of the functional domains involved in the formation of MAL–kinase complexes, computer-aided studies were used to characterize the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of phosphorylated BTK and PKCδ with MAL. Docking and physicochemical studies indicated that BTK was involved in close contact with Tyr86 and Tyr106 of MAL whereas PKCδ may phosphorylate Tyr106 only. Moreover, the electrostatics charge distribution of binding interfaces of BTK and PKCδ were distinct but compatible with respective regions of MAL. Our results implicate that position of Tyr86 is specifically phosphorylated by BTK whereas Tyr106 can be phosphorylated by competitive action of both BTK and PKCδ. Additionally, the residues of MAL which are necessary for interaction with TLR2, TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS-1 also play their roles in maintaining interaction with kinases and can be targeted in future to reduce TLR2 and TLR4 induced pathological responses.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There are about 10 different types of TLRs which belong to a family of transmembrane proteins and super-family of interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptors (Trinchieri and Sher, 2007; Takeda and Akira, 2005). Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) attach with the extracellular portion of TLRs and initiate innate immune responses (Bianchi, 2007). In case of TLR2 and TLR4, PAMPS bind with the extracellular portion of TLRs and induce oligomerization of their juxtamembrane parts followed by dimerization of their cytosolic portions known as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains (Trinchieri and Sher, 2007). TLR2 makes heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6 whereas homo-dimerization takes place between two TLR4s to initiate downstream signalling (Farhat et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2008; Nez Miguel et al., 2007). TIR domains have been reported for their importance to induce downstream signalling by recruiting other TIR domain containing adaptor proteins such as TIR domain-containing adapter inducing Interferon (IFN)-β, known as TLR adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1 or TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule, known as TLR adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM-2 or TRAM), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and MyD88-adaptor-like protein (TIRAP or MAL)(Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Yamamoto and Akira, 2005; Kawai et al., 1999; Gray et al., 2006).TIR domains mostly consists of five parallel β-sheets, designated as βA–βE surrounded by 5 α-helices, termed as αA–αE (Xu et al., 2000). Both of these secondary structures are linked by loops of variable lengths, which provide specificity to TIR–TIR domain interactions with different TLRs and their adaptor proteins. Different TLRs recruit individual adaptor proteins. Among others, TLR2 and TLR4 have the ability to recruit MAL protein. Formation of MAL–MyD88 complex with either TLR2 or TLR4 dimers have been implicated for the induction of nuclear factor κ B (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) dependent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN) γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) la, IL1β and IL6 (Dinarello, 2000). MAL has been also found in association with other multiple regulatory events after interacting with plasma membrane, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, TNF-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, suppressor of cytokine signalling protein (SOCS)-1, BTK and PKCδ (Kagan and Medzhitov, 2006; Verstak et al., 2009; Dunne et al., 2010; Muzio et al., 1997; Mansell et al., 2006).Phosphorylation of tyrosine (Tyr) residues in MAL have been suggested as an important event for the activation of MAL and for TLR2 and TLR4 downstream signalling (Piao et al., 2008). BTK, a Tec family tyrosine kinases, has been observed to induce phosphorylation at positions Tyr86 and Tyr106 of MAL (Gray et al., 2006). It has been associated with pathological conditions in case of autoimmunity and TLR mediated hyperinflammatory responses (Ahmad et al., 2012; Barral, 2013). Study of Kubo-Murai et al. suggested the involvement of PKCδ in TLR4 signalling through phosphorylation of TIR domain of MAL (Loegering and Lennartz, 2011; Kubo-Murai et al., 2007). However, site of phosphorylation is yet to be determined. Phosphorylation at sites Tyr159 and Tyr187 have also been associated with activation of MAL, but the available data is controversial (Gray et al., 2006; Piao et al., 2008). Mutagenic studies of MAL at positions 96, 100, 108,115, 117, 121, 132, 143, 165, 180, 184, 190 and 197 are suggested for their possible roles in loss of the function of MAL (Nagpal et al., 2009; Khor et al., 2007; Fitzgerald et al., 2001). This phenomenon suggests that with modulating the structure of MAL, immune disorders related with TLR2 and TLR4 can be controlled.Previous study of our group was about the characterization of PPI of MAL with MyD88 and SOCS-1 (Niazi et al., 2011). In extension, current study is presented for characterization of the possible interaction sites of MAL with BTK and PKCδ. The findings of the studies suggest that BTK may specifically be involved in the phosphorylation of Tyr86 whereas, BTK and PKCδ can play their competitive roles in the phosphorylation of Tyr106. Moreover, several sites reported for the loss of function are also discussed for their presence in binding interfaces and support the interaction of BTK and PKCδ with MAL, which can affect not only the interaction of MAL with TLR2, TLR4, MyD88 or SOCS-1 but can also affect the phosphorylation of MAL and may result into partial or complete loss of its activation.The AB loop in crystal structure of human TIR domain (residues 80–221) of MAL (PDB ID: 3UB2-crystal structure of TIR domain of MAL/TIRAP) deposited in protein data bank (PDB) (www.rcsb.org/pdb) was not resolved due to its flexible nature (Lin et al., 2012). So the AB loop was modelled using MODELLER (Eswar et al., 2006) and 100 loop models were generated. Loop confirmations were refined using 500 steps in variable target function method (VTFM) with conjugate gradients (CG), and then use slow refinement in molecular dynamics (MD) with simulated annealing (SA) refinement stage as implemented in MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1994). Optimizations were repeated three times for the generation of loop models. Models were clustered into groups based on root mean square distance (RMSD) between corresponding residues of each structure using NMRCLUST (Kelley et al., 1996). Clustered models were evaluated for the selection of representative model. ERRAT score (Colovos and Yeates, 1993), Verify3D (Bowie et al., 1991), potential energy of complete structure and of AB loop, Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963), and energy score calculated by MODELLER were used as criteria for evaluation of models.The sequence of catalytic domain of PKCδ (Phe349-Lys669) was obtained from Uniprot (www.uniprot.org) (ID No. Q05655). Sequence was submitted to NCBI provided protein specific iteration (PSI)-BLAST facility to obtain the homologous sequences of three dimensional (3D) structures present in PDB. Two structures including PDB IDs: 1XJD (crystal structure of kinase domain of human PKC theta (PKCθ) complexed with Staurosporine resolved at 2Å) (Xu et al., 2004) and 2JED (crystal structure of kinase domain of human PKCθ in complex with Nvp-Xaa228 resolved at 2.32Å) have maximum sequence identity and smallest distance on the phylogenetic tree from kinase domain of human PKCδ. These 3D structures were used as templates for the homology modelling of PKCδ. 3D-Coffee was used for the structural alignment among the sequences of PKCδ and its templates (Poirot et al., 2004). MODELLER was used for the homology modelling of PKCδ. One hundred models were produced, which were clustered into groups according to RMSD between corresponding residues in their structures using NMRCLUST. Representative models were selected from each cluster based on scores provided by ERRAT, Qmean, PROSA (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007), PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), Ramachandran plot, MODELLER and their potential energies. Glycine rich phosphate-binding loop (GPL) was refined using loop modelling module as implemented in MODELLER. Tyrosines at position 374 and 567, serines at positions 503,645, 654, 658 and 664 and threonine at position 507 were mutated to their phosphate group derivatives by using Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics (CHARMM) provided TP2, SP2 and THP2 patches, respectively, by MODELLER (Patel et al., 2004).Crystal structure of kinase domain of BTK was obtained from PDB deposited under ID: 1K2P (crystal structure of Bruton's tyrosine kinase domain resolved at 2.1Å) (Mao et al., 2001). Structure was phosphorylated at sites Tyr551, Tyr617, Ser623 by using the same procedure as adopted in case of phosphorylating the residues in model of pPKCδ. Structure was protonated in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software (Chemical computing group's MOE software, version 2013) using default parameters and utilized for further analysis (Inc., 2013).Visual molecular dynamics (VMD) and Not Another Molecular Dynamics program (NAMD) were used to prepare the structures before and after performing PPIs (Phillips et al., 2005; Humphrey et al., 1996). CHARM22 force field was used to perform minimization, equilibration and heating steps (MacKerell et al., 1998). Parameters and force fields for modified amino acids were used as provided by CHARMM. In each case of preparation of a structure, box of TIP3P water molecules was used as solvent. System was neutralized by adding the physiological concentration of Na+ and Cl− ions. Each system was subjected to minimization in stepwise manner. First a 3000 steps of minimization were performed only for water molecules and hydrogens atoms, fixing the rest of the system, so that water molecules could easily enter the grooves of structures. After the minimization of water and hydrogens of the system, 1000 steps of minimization were performed to the side chains of residues to reduce local strains. Seven thousand steps were used to minimize the backbone restraints followed by 10,000 steps of minimization on the overall system. In minimization stage, the number of steps were pre-calibrated for a point where the potential energy of each system became constant. After minimization stage each structure was heated from 0K to 310K (≈ body temperature) followed by equilibration at 310K for 300ps.PPIs of pBTK and pPKCδ with MAL were studied using GURU level interface provided at High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing (HADDOCK) web-server (haddock.science.uu.nl) (De Vries et al., 2010). HADDOCK web-server is driven on the approach of HADDOCK that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data (Dominguez et al., 2003). It also offers protein–protein ab initio dockings based on random patch definition and centre of mass restraints. The docking protocol support the solvated docking, automatic definition of semi-flexible regions and modified amino acids. Scoring is based on the desolvation energy term and other statistics including common contacts among cluster of complexes and RMSD values of interfaces of each structure in a complex etc.Possible residues of interfaces in each structure were predicted using the CPORT (Consensus Prediction Of interface Residues in Transient complexes) facility (de Vries and Bonvin, 2011). CPORT combine six interface prediction algorithms including PINUP (Liang et al., 2006), PIER (Kufareva et al., 2007), WHISCY (de Vries et al., 2006), ProMate (Neuvirth et al., 2004), cons-PPISP (Chen and Zhou, 2005) and SPPIDER (Porollo and Meller, 2007) collectively into one framework. It has been implicated that CPORT provides reliable predictions for the residues which can be integrated into the HADDOCK program.Two regions of MAL were used in the study of PPIs with kinases, which were recursively docked in those regions. Among them one region presents the CPORT predicted interface residues around the Tyr86 of MAL whereas another region presents the interface residues around Tyr106 of MAL. Confining the PPI of MAL with kinases was supported by already known phosphorylation sites, which can be used as interfaces for interaction with kinases.The modelling of ATP in complexes of pBTK and pPKCδ with MAL were performed to outline the distance of phosphorylatable atoms in Tyr86 and Tyr106 from γ-phosphate of ATP. Present version of HADDOCK webserver lack the capacity to calculate the PPIs in presence of any ligand or other biological small molecules. So modelling of ATP in the structures of pBTK and pPKCδ was performed after PPIs.Complexes of pBTK and pPKCδ with MAL were aligned to structures of Abl tyrosine Kinase complexed with Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), (PDB ID: 2G2I; a Src-like inactive conformation in the abl tyrosine kinase domain) (Levinson et al., 2006) and structure of atypical PKC, i.e. PKC iota (PKCι) complexed with ATP, (PDB ID: 3A8W; Crystal structure of PKC iota kinase domain) (Takimura et al., 2010), respectively, via automatic structural alignment in MOE. The molecule of ADP in Abl tyrosine kinase was updated to ATP by introducing a group of phosphate at β-phosphate followed by the energy minimization with Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) force field (Halgren, 1996) implemented in MOE before modelling of ATP in pBTK-MAL. Crystal structures of Abl tyrosine kinase and PKCι used for modelling of ATP in pBTK and pPKCδ were homologous to respective kinases.At first step, GPL of kinases and the surrounding residues within an area of 9Å of ATP in each complex were energy minimized to decrease the steric clashes and harmonic restraints. In this case, the remainder structure and ATP were kept fixed. Finally, the molecule of ATP was energy minimized by keeping the remainder structure fixed. The energy minimizations of protein structures and its parts were carried out using CHARMM22 force field whereas minimization of ATP was performed using MMFF94. Other programs including Jalview (Clamp et al., 2004), Pymol (Schrödinger, 2010), PDBSUM (Laskowski, 2001), Swiss-PDB Viewer (Kaplan and Littlejohn, 2001), UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004), PISA server (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) were used for sequence and structural analysis. Delphi (Li et al., 2012) was used for calculating the electrostatic charges on the surfaces of proteins. Residual interactions were determined using default set of parameters available in MOE.
