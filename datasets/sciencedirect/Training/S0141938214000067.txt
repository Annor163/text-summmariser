@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a power-efficient drive circuit for plasma display panels (PDPs). The proposed circuit reduces reactive power consumption by varying the inductance for energy recovery and by separating the grounds of the sustain and data drivers. Power consumption due to discharge current is reduced by using two soft-switching inductors for the pull-up switches in the bridge circuit. Power consumption for data addressing is reduced by using a dc voltage source to bias the ground for the sustain driver. The proposed circuit was tested on a 50″ full-HD single-scan PDP which had a sustain discharge gap of 80μm; total power consumption to display the dynamic broadcasting content of IEC 62087 was ∼40W (14.5%) less than that required by the conventional drive circuit, and the EMI level for 2<f<9MHz was reduced significantly. The experimental results demonstrate that a high performance power-efficient PDP drive circuit can be built using the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Major sources of power dissipation in the drive circuit of a plasma display panel (PDP) (Fig. 1) are ohmic loss on the sustain current path (Fig. 1, between nodes b and b′), hard-switching loss on the pull-up switches (Fig. 1, Q1Yand Q1Z), and switching loss on the data drive circuit. Ohmic loss on the sustain current path can be reduced by decreasing the capacitances between panel electrodes [1], by separating the ground for sustain circuit (CHGND) from the ground for data drive circuit (FGND) during the sustain period [2], or by both methods. The switching loss on the data drive circuit can be reduced by using a dc voltage bias between CHGND and FGND for the address period [3]; this bias allows use of a low-voltage data pulse.The leading and trailing edge (Fig. 2, ER_UP and ER_DN) waveforms of sustain pulses are generated by a resonance between the energy recovery (ER) inductors (LYand LZ) and the panel capacitance Cp≡CYZ+CYX, where CYZis capacitance between the scan electrode Y and common electrode Z, and CYXis capacitance between Y and the data electrode X. The resonance current decreases as ER inductance increases, so ohmic loss on the path of sustain current can also be reduced by increasing ER inductance. An increase of ER inductance causes the sustain discharge to be unstable when the number of ON cells on the panel (picture load PL) increases, because the gas discharge starts during the ER_UP period and the initial discharge current should be supplied through the ER inductors. One approach to solve this problem is to use the current injection method [4–10] in which the initial current for ER_UP is increased by applying a voltage source to the ER inductor before ER_UP. The increased ER current helps induce the sustain discharge properly. However, the current injection method does not much improve the power efficiency for high PL because the ohmic loss on the ER current path increases to build up the initial ER current.Another approach is to use the pull-up switches Q1Yand Q1Z[11]. The panel voltage VYincreases abruptly to the sustain voltage VSUSby closing one pull-up switch before completing a quarter of the ER resonance period, so the discharge current flows through the pull-up switch. Bypassing the discharge current decreases ohmic loss on the ER current path but increases hard-switching loss in the pull-up switches. The hard-switching loss increases with PL because the SUS_UP state starts earlier when PL is heavy than when it is light; this loss degrades the power efficiency.This paper presents a power-efficient drive circuit for PDPs. The circuit combines all previous methods of reducing PDP power consumption and improves the power efficiency by using two additional techniques: varying the ER inductance, and soft-switching the pull-up switches. The circuit has two separate ER paths to vary the ER inductance in accordance with PL. The ER inductances are L1 for one path and L2<L1 for the other. The ER path with L1 operates at low PL, the other operates at medium PL, and both operate at high PL. To reduce the hard-switching loss of the pull-up switches, the circuit uses two soft-switching inductors connected between the pull-up switches and the VSUSsource. Various methods of saving PDP power consumption are summarized in Section 2, the proposed circuit is described in Section 3, and the experimental results on a 50″ full-HD PDP are given in Section 4. A conclusion is given in Section 5.For a PDP that uses the address-display-separated method [12], some power is consumed during the address period because the charging/discharging current to X electrodes flows through the data drive circuit. This power loss can be reduced by using an energy recovery circuit [13] and by decreasing the data voltage VX[2]. The addressed picture is displayed during the sustain period, so considerable power is consumed during this period. This power consumption consists of reactive power consumption which is power loss caused by charging and discharging the panel capacitance, and discharge power consumption which is required to display the picture by inducing glow discharge. Reactive power consumption is important when the picture load is low, and discharge power consumption is important when PL is high. Discharge power consumption occurs in the panel and on the pull-up switches, so it can be reduced by soft-switching the pull-up switches.The source of reactive power consumption in a PDP drive circuit is the ohmic loss in the ER path. In a series resonant ER circuit (Fig. 1), the ER current iLis given by(1)iL(t)=VSUS2CpLsintCpL,where L≡LY=LZ. Ohmic loss for a given ER path resistance R is proportional toiL2, so this loss can be reduced by decreasing Cpor by increasing L; in floating sustain method, Cpis decreased [2] by separating CHGND from FGND for the sustain period, and in the current injection method, L is increased.The floating sustain method was proposed originally to suppress the facial discharge between X and Y, and between X and Z, during the sustain period [2]. In Fig. 1, FGND can be separated from CHGND by switching off the floating switch QFL. The panel capacitance Cpchanges from CYZ+CYXto CYZ+CYX/2 when QFLis switched off, so the floating sustain method can be used to reduce the reactive power consumption (Fig. 2a).The sustain voltage and current waveforms for the conventional and floating sustain methods were measured at L=400nH and VSUS=200V on a 50″ full-HD experimental PDP from LG electronics Co. (Fig. 2b). The PDP had CYZ=122nF and CYX=CZX=62nF. Thus, Cpdecreased from 184nF to 153nF (∼17%) when QFLwas switched off; it is expected from (1) that the peak of iL(t) would decrease by 8.9% for this change of Cp. Both the conventional and floating sustain methods produced similar VYwaveforms, and VCHGNDfor the floating sustain method was ∼VY/2. The peak of iLchanged from 68A (conventional) to 62A (floating sustain), which is ∼8.8% decrease.Luminous efficiency ηe=πEVA/PM, where EVis luminous intensity, A is the displayed area, and PMis the power supplied to PDP module [14], was measured using a CA-100 plus color analyzer from Minolta Inc., while displaying 4%, 9%, 16% and 25% white window box patterns (Fig. 3a). The durations of ER_UP and ER_DN states affect both EVand PM, so these states were adjusted for this measurement to maximize ηe. Compared with the conventional sustain method, the floating sustain method increase ηeby 6.15% for the 4% picture load and by 1–2% for the other PLs. At high PL, the floating sustain method produced a small increase in ηebecause the portion of reactive power in PMbecame small (Fig. 3b); the discharging power consumption curve intersected the reactive power curve at PL ∼10%.The reactive power consumption of a PDP can be reduced also by increasing ER inductance, thus decreasing iL(Eq. (1)). However, this increase of ER inductance produces an unstable sustain discharge at high PL. One possible method of solving this problem is to vary the ER inductance in accordance with PL. Replacing the circuit between nodes b and b′ in Fig. 1 with the circuit in Fig. 4results in three different ER inductances: LY1 using path 1, LY2 using path 2, and LY1LY2/(LY1+LY2) using both paths. By choosing LY1 and LY2 such that LY1>LY2 and LY1LY2/(LY1+LY2) is low enough to drive high PL, reactive power consumption can be reduced without causing unstable sustain discharge.The 50″ full-HD experimental PDP could be driven stably using LY1=900nH for PL<16% and LY1LY2/(LY1+LY2)=400nH for PL>45%, so LY2=700nH was used for 10<PL<45%. The peak ER currents calculated using Eq. (1) for the experimental PDP were 45.2A for LY1=900nH, 52.1A for LY2=700nH, and 67.8A for LY1LY2/(LY1+LY2)=400nH. When LY1=900nH and LY2=700nH were used to drive the experimental PDP, instead of LY=400nH, the improvement of ηe was 11.6% at PL=4% and decreased as PL increased (Fig. 5).The floating sustain and variable ER inductance methods did not effectively increase ηeat high PL, because discharge power consumption was much higher than reactive power consumption. The discharge current was supplied through pull-up switches Q1Yand Q1Z(Fig. 1), so ηecan be increased by reducing the hard-switching loss in the pull-up switches. Soft-switching of the pull-up switches is possible if the circuit between nodes b and b′ (Fig. 1) is replaced with the proposed circuit (Fig. 6). The modifications from the Y drive circuit in Fig. 1 were as follows: an inductor LDYwas placed between the drain (Fig. 6, node c) of switches and the VSUSsource to limit initial switching current, and the ER inductor LYand two protection diodes (D1Y, D2Y) were placed between CER,Yand Q3Y. (If D1Yand D2Yare placed at the original position, a resonance between LDYand Cpcauses LYand D1Yto form a leakage path when the node voltage VYat b′ overshoots VSUS). The Z drive circuit was modified in the same way.The proposed soft-switching sustain circuit was tested on the 50″ full-HD experimental PDP. The measured switch voltage VDSand current IDSwaveforms for LDY=200nH (Fig. 7) show that the hard-switching loss was negligible. ηefor 100% PL was measured at LD≡LDY=LDZ=0, 100, 200, and 300nH (Fig. 8a). ηefor 100% PL was ∼11.6% lower at LD=0nH than at LD=200nH. At LD⩽200nH, ηeincreased with LDbecause IDSdecreased at a high LD. At LD=300nH, IDSwas too low to support strong sustain discharge. ηevalues for PLs of 45%, 70%, and 100% were measured at LD=0nH and 200nH (Fig. 8b); the soft-switching of pull-up switches increased ηeby ∼4.2% for 45% PL, by ∼ 9.9% for 70% PL, and 11.6% for 100% PL.The light emissions from sustain discharge were measured using APD module C5331-03 from Hamamatsu Photonics Co. (Fig. 9). The soft-switching of pull-up switches using LD=200nH lowered and spread the light emission peaks (Fig. 9a and b), when compared with the light emission for 100% PL at LD=0nH (Fig. 9a). A similar tendency was observed at LD=200nH when PL increased from 45% to 100% (Fig. 9b and c). Lowering and spreading the light emission helps improve ηebecause the ohmic loss in the SUS_UP path decreases as discharge current IDSdecreases. LDcaused an overshoot of sustain voltage by VSUS−VER/UP, where VER_UPis the voltage of Y and Z electrodes at the end of ER_UP period. Because the overshoot voltage does not depend on Cpwhich can vary with the PL, it can provide an advantage of lowering VSUSwithout narrowing the VSUSmargin window.The biased scan method was proposed to reduce power consumption in the data drive circuit [3]. This method uses two grounds: FGND and CHGND similar to the floating sustain method. To lower the data drive voltage, FGND is biased during the address period using a dc voltage source, but is connected to CHGND during the reset and sustain periods. When the drive circuit uses the floating sustain method, the biased scan can be implemented at low additional cost because it requires a switch QBIASand dc voltage source VX_BIASonly (Fig. 10).The experimental PDP drive circuit (Fig. 10) combined all methods of reducing PDP power consumption described in Section 2. In the experimental circuit, the switches Q1Y, Q1Z, Q2Y, and Q2Zimplemented a full bridge inverter. LDYand LDZwere connected in series with the pull-up switches Q1Yand Q1Zto reduce hard-switching loss. QFLwas turned on but QBIASwas turned off during the reset period to achieve appropriate reset operation. QBIASwas turned on but QFLwas turned off during the address period, so FGND was biased by a dc voltage source VX_BIAS, which achieved the biased scan. To implement the floating sustain method, FGND was separated from CHGND during the sustain period by turning off QFLand QBIAS. The circuit had two ER paths: Q5–Q4Y1–Q3Y1–LY1–CER,Yand Q5–Q4Y2–Q3Y2–LY2–CER, Yon the Y drive board, and Q3Z1–Q4Z1–LZ1–CER, Zand Q3Z2–Q4Z2–LZ2–CER,Zon the Z drive board; this use of two paths reduced the reactive power consumption by varying the ER inductance in accordance with PL.The waveforms shown in Fig. 11were used to drive the experimental PDP. In the experimental PDP drive circuit, the waveforms for reset and address operations were generated using the set-up and set-down ramp generators (Q6 and Q7, respectively), and using the scan and data drive ICs, in the same way as in the conventional drive circuits [3].The proposed PDP drive circuit was implemented using five circuit boards (Fig. 12); scan pulses, data pulses, and control signals for switches were generated on the scan, X drive, and control boards, respectively. The sustain pulses, reset voltage ramps, and VX_BIASand VZ_BIASvoltages were generated on the Z and Y drive boards. The grounds for Z and Y boards (FGNDs) were connected using the alternate wire connection method [2]. The following components were used for the Z and Y drive boards: CER,Z=CER,Y=47μF, LDY=LDZ=200nH, LY1=LZ1=900nH, LY2=LZ2=700nH, 30F122 insulated gate bipolar transistors from Toshiba Semiconductor Co. for the switches, and SF20LC30S fast recovery diodes from Shindengen Electric Co. for the protection diodes.
