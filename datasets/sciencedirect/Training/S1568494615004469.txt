@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an experimental methodology of Design for Manufacturing (DFM) used for survey and analysis of geometric deviations of CNC Machine-Tools, through their final product. These deviations generate direct costs that can be avoided through the use of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS), by the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the fabrication parameters. Finally, after the experiments, it was possible to evaluate the experimental methodology used, the equations, the variables of data adjustment and thus enable the validation of the methodology used as a tool for DFM with high potential return on product quality, development time and reliability of the process with wide application in various CNC Machines.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Along with machine-tools (MT) evolution, there have been great advances in machining processes. However, obtaining complex surfaces with tolerance in the micrometric range has become extremely difficult. At the same time, the machining manufacturing process control has been evolving to attend the technical challenges imposed by complex requirements of form, by narrow specification limits and by the frequent introduction of new materials, tools and operational variables that originate new interactions in the processes with non-linear and non-standardized characteristics [1–4].In the current manufacturing environment, indirect manufacturing operations generate direct costs that can be avoided or reduced by using control systems [5,6]. The use of Intelligent Manufacture Systems (IMS) has been researched through the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since 1980 [7].In this context, an important methodology of predictive engineering is the Design for Manufacturing (DFM). It incorporates, in the project processes, information referring to the manufacture, also allowing for the project to be adapted during each stage of production [8].This paper presents a study where, at first the geometric deviations of a machine-tool are analyzed through the unfinished product. Afterwards, ANNs are used to develop models to minimize error prediction of the milled surface. A DFM approach is proposed to implement in the Computer-aided design (CAD) software, through the existing Application Programming Interface (API), the parameter soft correction/control of the geometric deviations compensation, before the manufacturing of the products. Finally, some practical experiments are discussed to evaluate the proposed approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Concerning the ANN models studied, we could verify that MLP model has a simple architecture (3-1-1) and can exhibit excellent performance (Table 3). Still, it is observed that there is a connection with the work done by Zhang [39] and also described by Zain [33], suggesting some MLP network models as symmetrical formations and/or geometrical proportion. Then, they can be used as basis for future research to solve problems in manufacturing processes, for example: turning, electro-erosion, micro-machining, CNC oxygen cutting, and fast prototyping among others.Concerning the practical experiments, we can perceive that the average deviations for Z along the X and Y axes showed to be significantly smaller (about 60%) than the reference values (see Fig. 13a and b), these results are better than those presented both by Shaowei et al. [13] as Gangwei et al. [14] and similar to those presented by Akafor and Yalcin [16], but with in this work a simpler methodology and ANN model were used. Also, can be inferred that the deviations existing in the product should come from other sources, not approached in this research, such as: thermal effects, forces on the piece/tool, etc.Furthermore, we can conclude that the experimental method used to obtain practical data allowed for excellent quality acquisition to carry out the statistical analysis and computational modeling, but in a median precision since the MMC 3D has a precision range similar to MF. Nevertheless, we could still validate the method proposed here because the activities flow provided the quantity and types needed for the research. This work also developed a new set of IMS techniques which can be used for this specific application and for others, according to each company's needs, or in the academic environment to carry out new studies and to improve systems, parameters, metrics or for future research associate other deviations existing in MT presented by other authors [11–17].Finally, it is evident that the techniques proposed in this research allow for more competitiveness by insuring that the final product is in accordance with the respective tolerances and with smaller error. Thus, it contributes to provide better quality for the final product and the integration between the project and the manufacturing activities in a computational integrated environment.
