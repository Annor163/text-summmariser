@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a novel method including segmentation, a combination of new and well-known feature extraction and classification methods to classify plant leaves. The aim of the proposed features is to distinguish leaf margins, which cannot be distinguished using commonly used geometric features. Additionally, Linear Discriminant Classifier is used for classification, therefore using features that are noisy for some leaf types does not reduce the performance of the system. The proposed system outperforms the well-known geometric methods that are used for leaf classification.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Automated plant classification has many application fields [1–7], such that it can be used to identify endangered plant species [8] or used in automation systems that separate undesired plants from a product. Additionally, it may serve as a tool to identify plants [9,6]. Leaf is considered as an important feature of a plant for classification [10].Geometric features are successfully used in leaf classification in the literature [8,11,12]. Low dimensionality is the major advantage of geometric features. However, geometric features can only describe coarse shape of the leaf such as its similarity to a circle. Using moment invariants and contour-based shape descriptors [13] adds more details to leaf descriptor. However, they cannot distinguish between leaf margin and noise.There are many different methods in the literature to classify leaves. Authors in [14] propose the use of features extracted from leaf veins and areoles to classify types of legume plants. In this research, three methods, namely support vector machines, penalized discriminant analysis and random forests methods are analyzed. The results demonstrate that random forests method reaches up to 90% accuracy.Authors in [15] propose two new spline embedding based methods called orthogonal locally discriminant spline embedding (OLDSE-I and OLDSE-II). These methods also employ maximum margin criterion method (MMC) which is used to reduce dimensionality.In [16], authors propose a novel shape descriptor – Multi-level Curve Segment Measures (MLCSM) – for the purpose of leaf retrieval. MLCSM is rotation and scale invariant shape descriptor that can capture statistical characteristics such as curve bending, convexity and concavity of curve segments. This operation is performed over different curve lengths. The results demonstrated in [16] show that MLCSM has the highest performance and comparable computational complexity.A method that uses semantic information and active contour segmentation is proposed in [17]. This method proposes polygonal model parameters used for segmentation, base and tip model and curvature scale histogram as features. The authors demonstrated the performance of their systems over Pl@ntLeaves dataset [18]. Another plant identification system called Leafsnap is proposed in [6]. This paper details a complete system from acquisition to presenting the results. However, the speed of this system is a limiting factor as it takes 5.4s for a single leaf classification.A novel contour-based shape descriptor which is named as Multiscale Distance Matrix (MDM) is proposed in [13]. This method is invariant to rotation, scaling and symmetry changes. Additionally, the authors proposed Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC) method to reduce dimensionality. Finally, Nearest Neighbor Classifier (NNC) is used for classification. Although MDM effectively describes the broad shape of the leaf, it fails to capture the details.Another method that works on leaf textures is proposed in [2]. In this method, Gabor co-occurrences are used as features. For classification, this method uses KNN with Jeffery-divergence distance measure. The reported results display 85% accuracy on a hand selected leaf texture database containing 32 classes. Performing this algorithm on randomly selected sections of leaves produces 80% accuracy.An information retrieval method using Inner Distance Shape Context is proposed in [5]. During this research, authors have built a system that allows Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History botanists to catalog and search three new databases.Authors in [19] propose a method that uses shape and venation features for leaf image retrieval. Minimum Perimeter Polygons (MPP) are used to extract shape features and Nearest Neighbor Classifier is employed for leaf classification. For venation classification, the method extracts several parameters and compares them using ANN. Results are only demonstrated for venation classification which divides leaves into three venation based classes.A Content-Based Image Retrieval method is proposed for leaves in [20]. This method uses venation information to classify venation pattern of a leaf before performing retrieval using shape information. The authors demonstrate that using venation classification increases the precision of the system by 25% on average.A probabilistic neural network system that works on geometric features is proposed in [8], which extracts 12 geometric features from segmented leaf image. The research is performed on 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy of 90%. This method requires user to enter start and end points of the midrib. Therefore, this method cannot be used for automated classification tasks. On the other hand, authors in [21] use a modified Minimum Perimeter Polygons approach to reduce the number features and increase the accuracy. They have presented their methods using an information retrieval system.Authors in [11] propose leaf classification based on geometric features. They have identified 8 geometric features in addition to 7 moment invariants. After feature extraction, their proposed system performs linear scaling and Wilson Editing. This method uses Moving Center Hypersphere Classifier, which is proposed specifically for leaf classification. On the other hand, dynamic Time Warping algorithm is used in [22] to extract features and KNN is employed to classify leaf images. Authors in [22] used 6 different plant species and achieved 97% accuracy.In this paper, we propose a leaf classification system that uses geometric features, Multi-scale Distance Matrix (MDM) and moment invariants as well as new features we have proposed specifically for leaf classification. Moment invariants and MDM cannot distinguish between leaf margin and noise. In order to solve this issue, we propose five additional features that describe leaf margins. We have also employed Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC) for the reason that it can work with different classes having different importance factor for features. This trait is important as some features of a leaf may show large amount of variance whereas in another leaf type the same feature will produce less variance. Margin statistics are described in Section 2.2.6.Compared to the state-of-the-art shape based leaf identification methods, our proposed method has better performance in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method employs LDC which has a lower computational complexity compared to many other classifiers.
