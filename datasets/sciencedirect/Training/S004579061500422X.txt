@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Next Generation wireless networks require high speed and high data rate communication to support a wide range of applications, including voice, video, e-mail, web browsing, and so on. Due to the multi-path component of a wireless environment, it is challenging to provide a reliable communication link. Further, when multiple users communicate over the same frequency band at the same time, they will experience conflicts due to multiple-access interference (MAI). Verdu introduced the concept of multi-user detection (MUD) for code division multiple-access (CDMA) and demonstrated that, it is possible to exploit this interference to mitigate its effect when the multi-user signals have been propagated through multi-path environments. Further, it has been elucidated in [1] that MUD outperforms any single-user reception for a multi-user setting when communicated over a multi-path environment. Furthermore, as described in [2,3], MUD is capable of enhancing the bit error rate (BER) performance, thus allowing for the inclusion of more users, than corresponding systems not using MUD by mitigating MAI, multi-stream interference (MSI), and co-channel interference (CCI). Explicitly, this type of MUD, when employed at the base station, can alleviate the effects of these interferences and hence provides better BER performance. Nevertheless, for downlink (DL) communication, we require a low-complexity mobile station with higher power-efficiency. Hence, the concept of a multi-user transmitter pre-processing technique (MUTP) has attracted the interest of the research community. The MUTP technique transfers the required signal processing from the mobile station to the base station for DL communication and hence reduces the complexity of the receiver [3]. MUTP requires the knowledge of the channel state matrix of all of the users at the base station (BS) in DL communication to formulate the pre-processing matrix. In [3,4], the authors have elucidated that a higher BER performance can be achieved for DS-CDMA and SDMA systems using zero forcing (ZF) MUTP by alleviating the effect of DL multi-user interferences. In [5], the authors demonstrated the performance of singular value decomposition (SVD) based MUTP for uplink (UL) communication. In [6], the authors addressed the BER performance of MUTP assisted MIMO-space division multiple access (SDMA) and demonstrated that the TP technique provides a superior performance by mitigating the effects of MSI and MAI. In [7], the authors explicated the BER performance of SVD based MUTP technique for a double space-time transmit diversity (DSTTD)-SDMA system over correlated frequency-selective channels and demonstrated, by using simulation results, that its performance is superior in terms of the BER.To achieve a higher BER performance, the concept of a chip interleaved code division multiple access (CDMA) system has been recommended as a possible access scheme for future wireless communication that can mitigate the effects of MAI and inter-symbol-interference (ISI). Such an accessing scheme offers all of the benefits of CDMA with a low level spreading sequence. In [8,9], the author and his team elucidated that it is possible to achieve a high processing gain when the bandwidth expansion is dedicated to low-rate channel encoding. The author Frenger and his team proposed code-spread CDMA [9], which combines the advantages of low-rate channel encoding and direct sequence (DS)-spreading and demonstrated that it is possible to achieve higher BER than conventional CDMA. It was elucidated in [10] that the chip-interleaved CDMA is capable of providing superior results in terms of BER by mitigating the effects of MAI and ISI. In [10], Li Ping and his team demonstrated that chip interleaved CDMA, known as interleave division multiple access (IDMA), outperforms CDMA system by invoking the turbo style of decoding algorithm. Further, in [11], it was demonstrated that multi-carrier (MC)-IDMA is capable of providing better BER in addition to the higher spectral efficiency for DL communication when the iterative decoding algorithm is invoked.Most of the above-mentioned research papers considered the MUTP technique for the SDMA system [7]. In this contribution, we consider the problem of mitigating the effects of MAI and ISI using the ZF-MUTP algorithm for the IDMA system and evaluate the BER performance of the ZF-MUTP aided turbo-coded IDMA system, considering both the equal power approach and the maximum-signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) approach. We also compare the performance of our considered MUTP assisted turbo-coded IDMA with an uncoded IDMA system. We developed the channel model based on Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) specifications, as detailed in Table 1, to investigate the BER performance of our considered system.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the system configuration. Section 3 illustrates the power allocation regime. Section 4 describes the performance results and discussion. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.Fig. 1shows the transceiver structure of a ZF-MUTP assisted coded IDMA system. In this correspondence, we assume that the K DL users are randomly distributed in a single cell system. We assume the following: base station is equipped with Nttransmit antennas and each of the mobile stations is equipped with Nrreceive antennas.Let the input bit stream corresponding to the kth user be denoted bydk. We modulate the bit stream using the BPSK modulation technique. We then encode the bit stream using the turbo code. In this context, letukrepresent the transmitted bit stream to the kth user after channel coding. Therefore, we have(1)uk=[uk1,uk2,…,ukm]T,k=1,2,…,Kwhere m represents the number of bits in the encoded stream. Further, letckdenote the spreading code corresponding to the kth user(2)ck=1Nc[ck0,ck1,…,ck(Nc−1)]Twhere Ncrepresents the spreading length.In a typical IDMA system, the spreading code is the same for all users. Using Eq. (2), the (Ncm × m) component time-domain spread matrix that will be employed by the kth user can be expressed as(3)Ck=diag{ck,ck,ck,…,ck},k=1,2,…KThe spread sequence is then interleaved by using a user-specific interleaver πk, which is given byCkuk. If we consider K DL users, then the spread and interleaved signal in the context of K DL users can be expressed as(4)x=∑k=1KCkukxrepresents an Ncm length vector.After spreading and interleaving, pre-processing is performed. The spread, interleaved and pre-processed signal that will be transmitted to the K DL users can be expressed as(5)s=PxwherePis the (Ncm × Ncm) pre-processing matrix andsis the Ncm length symbol vector.The received vector at the kth MS can be expressed [11] as(6)yk=Hks+nk,k=1,2,…,Kwhere,nkis an Ncm noise vector .In this study, we assume that the impulse response of the channel that connects the kth MS and BS is frequency-selective. To be specific, the channel model is based on the Standard University Interim (SUI) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel specifications. The channel model parameters are summarized in Table 1. For frequency-selective fading, the channel impulse response connecting the jth receive antenna and the ith transmit antenna can be expressed as(7)hji(t)=∑l=1Lhjil∂(t−τl)where L represents the number of paths between the jth receive antenna and the ith transmit antenna.Assuming that each bit experiences different fading, the impulse response of the channelHkcan be modeled as thediag{h1k,h2k,h3k,⋯,hNcm}.Hkrepresents an (Ncm × Ncm) component matrix. Therefore, the received vector for the kth user can be represented as,(8)yk=HkPkxk︸DesiredSignal+∑i=1,i≠kKHkPixi︸MAI+nkThe decision variable for the kth user can now be expressed as(9)yk=CkTHkPkx^k+n^kwherex^krepresents the de-interleaved data for the kth user.n^krepresents the zero mean complex Gaussian vector.Pkrepresents ZF approach pre-processing matrix with power normalization for the kth user and is derived by satisfying the following condition for value of k ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...K} [3](10)HkPk>0andHkPj=0foranyj≠kThe above condition is applicable for the construction of pre-processing matrix for all users.The pre-processing matrixPkcorresponding to the kth user is (Ncm × Ncm) dimensional matrix as indicated and is constructed to lie in the subspace determined byHk, which is orthogonal to the(K−1)mrank subspace constituted by allHj,forj=1,2,…,K;j≠k. In other words, the pre-processing matrix is derived with the aid of anNcm×Nc(K−1)mchannel impulse response (CIR) matrix associated with the interfering users.LetH¯kdenote the CIR matrix [11] for deriving the pre-processing matrix for the kth MS; the matrix can be represented as(11)H¯k=[H1TC1,H2TC2…,Hk−1TCk−1,Hk+1TCk+1,…,HKTCK],k=1,2,…,KThe pre-processing matrix [3] for the kth user considering the power normalizing coefficient can be expressed as follows(12)Pk=ψkP˜k,k=1,2,…,Kwhere(13)P˜k=[INcm−H¯k*(H¯kTH¯k*)−1]THk*,k=1,2,…,K(.)* represents the conjugate of the argument andψkdesignates the power normalization coefficients that should satisfy the constraint(14)Trace(PkHPkψk2)≤mWe can obtainu^kafter substituting the value ofPkin Eq. (9). After channel decoding that is operated based on Max log-Map algorithm [12–14], thed^kis obtained.Considering K DL users, the de-interleaved and de-spread chip sequence of all K users’ signals can now be expressed [11] as(15)y^=CTHP¯x^+n^wherey^=[y^1T,y^2T,y^3T,…,y^KT]Tis a (Km × 1) component received vector for all of the signals of the K users.H=[H1T,H2T,H3T,…,HKT]Tis a (KNcm × Ncm) component channel matrix,P¯=[P1,P2,…,PK]is an (Ncm × KNcm) overall pre-processing matrix,C=diag{C1,C2,C3,…,CK−1,CK}is a (KNcm × Km) component spreading matrix,x^=[x^1T,x^2T,x^3T,…,x^KT]Tis a (KNcm × 1) coded bits stream of all K users signals,n^=[n^1T,n^2T,n^3T,…,n^KT]is a (Km × 1) component vector, which is a circularly symmetric Gaussian distributed complex random variable with a mean of zero and variance σ2.In the context of DL transmission, the total transmission power after pre-processing should not surpass the original transmission power from the BS before transmitter pre-processing [3,6]. Hence, the power allocation scheme is implemented under the constraint that(16)E[∥Pd2∥]≤E[d2]=KNrwhere E[•] denotes the expectation of the argument.To implement the above mentioned constraint, we presume that(17)E[∥ddH∥]=IKNrand hence, the constraint becomes(18)Trace(P˜HP˜ψ2)≤KNrWe assume thatpii> 0 (1 ≤ i ≤ KNr) represents the diagonal elements of the matrixP˜HP˜.Hence, Eq. (18) can be expressed as(19)∑i=1KNkpiiψii2≤KNrwhereP=P˜ψψ=diag{ψ1,ψ2,ψ3,…,ψKNcm}Now considering the individual users, the power allocation policy can be implemented under the constraint thatE[∥Pkdk2∥]≤E[∥dk2∥]where(20)Pk=P˜kψkHence, by substituting the Pk, the above constraint can be represented as(21)Trace(P˜kHP˜kψk2)≤NrRepresenting [pii] , (1 ≤ i ≤ Nr) as the diagonal elements of the matrixP˜kHP˜k, the constraint can be expressed as(22)∑i=1Nkpkiiψkii2≤NrIn the context of the MSNR power allocation scheme, the overall BER performance of DL communication can be improved if the BS maximizes the factor ϕk. where(23)ϕk=∑i=1Nt1/Wki=∑i=1Ntσ2(λkiψki2)(24)Wki=Nt(∑j=1Nt1λkj)−1×1λki,i=1,2,3,…,Nt,k=1,2,3,…Kλ represents the eigenvalueand is selected to satisfy the power allocation constraint of Eq. (19).In this section, we present the performance of coded ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system for the SUI channel models [15] and LTE [16] channel models by invoking the two power allocation regimes, namely, the equal power regime and the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) regime. We describe the channel model parameters in Table 1 and the simulation parameters in Table 2. We presume a Doppler shift of 0.5 Hz, with antenna correlation of 0.7 and 0.4 for SUI-1 and SUI-3 channel models [15], respectively. For the SUI-5 channel model, we consider a Doppler shift of 2.5 Hz, with antenna correlation of 0.3. We assume a Doppler shift of 70 Hz and 300 Hz and a mobile moving at a velocity of 40.8 km/hr and 162 km/hr based on the LTE-typical urban channel and LTE-extended vehicular channel specifications [16]. In addition, we employ 15,000 channel realizations for each value of SNR. We realize the binary PSK modulation technique and 50 users with three iterations for a coded system. Further, we considered a spreading length of 128 and three iterations. Furthermore, we have considered maximum log-MAP type turbo decoder for our analysis.Fig. 2shows the BER performance of uncoded IDMA system with ZF-MUTP and an equal power allocation regime when communicating over a three tap fading channel model pertaining to the SUI-1 channel specifications. The uncoded system with ZF-MUTP provides a BER of 10−3 at an SNR of 20 dB.Fig. 3shows the BER performance of our considered system with the turbo code for the SUI-1 channel specifications, considering both the equal power regime and the MSNR regime. The MSNR power allocation regime attempts to assign more power to the sub-channel with a smaller eigenvalue; hence, we observed that the performance of our considered system employing MSNR is superior to that of the equal power allocation regime. From our simulation results, it is observed that the coded ZF-MUTP based IDMA system employing MSNR power allocation scheme provides a BER of 10−5 at an SNR of 1 dB, while our considered system with equal power allocation regimeprovides a BER of 10−5 at an SNR of 2 dB. From Figs. 2 and3, it is observed that our considered system with iterative decoding algorithm provides superior performance in terms of the achievable BER with less SNR.Fig. 4 illustrates the BER performance of a coded ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system for SUI-3 channel specifications. From Fig. 4, we observe that to achieve a BER of 10−4, our considered coded ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system considering an equal power allocation scheme requires a SNR of 1.6 dB, whereas the MSNR power allocation scheme requires a SNR of only 0.6 dB for an SUI-3 channel model.Fig. 5 depicts the BER performance of a coded ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system for the SUI-5 channel specifications. From Fig. 5, it is observed that to achieve a BER of 10−4, the coded ZF-MUTP supported IDMA system employing an equal power scheme requires a SNR of 1.7 dB, whereas our considered system with the MSNR power allocation scheme requires an SNR of 0.9 dB for an SUI-5 channel model.Fig. 6 indicates the BER performance of our considered ZF-MUTP assisted IDMA system when invoking either the equal power allocation strategy or the MSNR policy for an LTE-extended vehicular channel model. From the figure, it can be observed that the ZF-MUTP assisted system with MSNR policy provides a better BER performance.Fig. 7demonstrates the BER performance comparison of our considered ZF-MUTP aided IDMA system using the equal power allocation strategy and MSNR policy for an LTE-extended typical urban channel model. From the figure, we observe that our considered system with a MSNR based power allocation policy provides a better BER performance with less SNR.
