@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Distance functions in production theory are mathematical structures that characterize the belonging to the reference technology through a numerical value, behave as technical efficiency measures when the focus is analyzing an observed input–output vector within its production possibility set and present a dual relationship with some support function (profit, revenue, cost function). In this paper, we endow the well-known weighted additive models in Data Envelopment Analysis with a distance function structure, introducing the Weighted Additive Distance Function and showing its main properties.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Efficiency evaluation in production of whatever type of firm and public organization has been a relevant topic for managers and policy makers as well as an area of interest from a practical and methodological point of view in both operations research (OR) and economics. The main aim of such assessment is to analyze the efficiency of a so-called DMU (Decision Making Unit), which uses several inputs to produce several outputs, by comparing its performance with respect to the boundary of a technology using to that end a sample of other DMUs operating in a similar technological environment.Chronologically speaking, the empirical estimation of the underlying technologies began in the area of economics with the application of regression analysis and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate a parametrically specified ‘average’ production function, e.g., a Cobb–Douglas function (Cobb & Douglas, 1928). Later, Farrell (1957) was the first in showing, for a single output and multiple inputs, how to estimate an isoquant enveloping all the observations. Farrell's paper inspired other authors to continue this line of research estimating production functions that envelop all the observations of the sample by either a non-parametric piece-wise linear technology or a parametric function. The first possibility was taken up by Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984), Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) and others, resulting in the development of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), adopted mostly by engineers and OR practitioners; while the latter approach was taken up by Aigner and Chu (1968), Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977) and others, subsequently resulting in the development of the deterministic and stochastic frontier models, adopted mostly by economists and statisticians.In contrast to the parametric literature on efficiency, where the measurement of technical efficiency in the context of multiple-outputs is based on a few measures, fundamentally the Shephard input and output distance function and the directional distance function, the first years of life of DEA witnessed the introduction of many different technical efficiency measures, such as the Russell input and output measures of technical efficiency and their graph extension; the Russell Graph Measure of technical efficiency (see Färe, Grosskopf, & Lovell, 1985), the additive model (Charnes, Cooper, Golany, Seiford, & Stutz, 1985), the Range-Adjusted Measure (Cooper, Park, & Pastor, 1999) and the Enhanced Russell Graph (Pastor, Ruiz, & Sirvent, 1999) or Slacks-Based Measure (Tone, 2001), to name but a few. One of the reasons for the introduction of many different technical efficiency measures in DEA is the piece-wise linear nature of the boundary of the technology. In this context, a notion that comes into play is Pareto-efficiency (Koopmans, 1951). Pareto-efficiency, however, seems not be a problem for the parametric approach, where the functional forms utilized to model the frontier of production are usually smooth. On the contrary, it has been a recurring theme in DEA. In particular, the additive model by Charnes et al. (1985) was the first graph linear model11The Russell Graph Measure (Färe et al., 1985) also projects the evaluated points onto the Pareto-efficient frontier but its objective function is not linear.that ensured that the evaluated DMU was compared exclusively with respect to the set of Pareto-efficient points in the input–output space. From this model, DEA researchers have introduced some modifications of the original additive model weighting the slacks that appear in the objective function (see, for example, Cooper et al., 1999, Cooper, Pastor, Borras, Aparicio, & Pastor, 2011a, Lovell & Pastor, 1995 and Pastor, Aparicio, Alcaraz, Vidal, & Pastor, 2015) in order to measure technical inefficiency using the strongly efficient frontier as a reference. This existence of a different battery of tools for estimating technical efficiency in the parametric and non-parametric world reveals the importance in DEA in measuring efficiency with respect to the Pareto-efficient frontier.As another matter of fact, most of the classical results and applications in microeconomics related to the measurement and decomposition of overall efficiency, in terms of technical and allocative (price) efficiency, and the estimation of productivity change over time from panel data are based on the notion of distance function and duality theory. A distance function behaves, in fact, as a technical efficiency measure when an observation belonging to the reference technology is evaluated, with a meaning of ‘distance’ from the assessed interior point to the boundary of the production possibility set.22In this paper, we distinguish two situations. The first one is related to any distance function when it is utilized for evaluating a set of DMUs with respect to their contemporaneous production technology. In this case, hereafter, we will speak of ‘technical efficiency’. Otherwise, we will simply speak of the distance from the assessed point to the frontier of the reference production possibility set. This second scenario can occur, for example, if the evaluated unit is observed in period t of time and the reference technology is estimated from observations of period t+1.Also, the distance functions have dual relationships with well-known support functions in microeconomics, as the profit function or the cost and revenue functions. Another interesting feature of these functions is that they characterize the belonging or not belonging to the technology by means of a sign, as happens with the directional distance function, or by being greater or lesser than one, as in the case of the Shephard distance functions. This feature easily allows measuring productivity change over time; even in the case of cross-period evaluation when a unit observed in period t+1 under assessment is outside the technology corresponding to period t.In a non-parametric framework, except for the case of resorting to typical parametric tools, i.e. the Shephard distance functions and the directional distance function, whose duality relationships with classical support functions were proved for production possibility sets fulfilling general axioms (e.g. convexity) and, therefore, may be applied to polyhedral technologies, most attempts at estimating overall efficiency and productivity change in DEA neglect the notion of distance function, a fact that contrasts significantly with the traditional view of economics of production, where both this concept and duality are the cornerstones of the applied theory. In this way, some researchers have tried to use additive-type models in DEA for measuring not only technical inefficiency but also productivity and profit inefficiency without resorting directly to the notion of distance function. To that end, they have somehow adapted a ‘pure’ technical inefficiency measure, the additive model, to be used in other contexts (e.g. productivity), exploiting features that are not specific to a technical efficiency measure but rather a distance function.Regarding productivity, Grifell-Tatjé, Lovell, and Pastor (1998) introduced the quasi-Malmquist productivity index as a modification of the traditional Malmquist index based on an output-oriented weighted additive model. Additionally, Du, Chen, Chen, Cook, and Zhu (2012), Premachandra, Chen, and Watson (2011) and Du, Wang, Chen, Chou, and Zhu (2014) use an additive-type approach to check superefficiency a laAndersen and Petersen (1993). However, their model always provides non-negative values at the optimum whereas we seek to distinguish the belonging or not belonging to the reference technology by the sign of the optimal value of the additive model (non-negative/negative). Other related literature is one that addresses the issue of measuring and decomposing input-specific productivity. As for this literature, the different approaches that can be found to measure and decompose input-specific productivity change over time resort to a version of the input-oriented weighted additive model, although the different authors invoke the name of other measures as the Russell input measure (Oude Lansink & Ondersteijn, 2006), the input-oriented version of the directional slacks-based measure of inefficiency by Mahlberg and Sahoo (2011), based on Fukuyama and Weber (2009), or the Färe and Grosskopf (2010) slacks-based measure of efficiency in the directional input distance function context (Chang, Hu, Chou, & Sun, 2012, Skevas & Oude Lansink, 2014 and Kapelko, Horta, Camanho & Oude Lansink, 2015). In these cases, the corresponding slacks are constrained to be non-positive for cross-period evaluation by previously determining whether the assessed unit belongs to the reference technology or not and, consequently, the measures obtained are negative for units located out of the production possibility set and non-negative for units placed inside this set, a feature more usual of a distance function than a technical efficiency measure.As for the measurement of overall efficiency, as far as we are aware, there have only been two attempts at estimating and decomposing profit inefficiency through additive-type models in DEA. The first one is that based on the paper of Cooper et al. (1999). These authors focus their interest on the traditional difference-form to measure profit inefficiency, i.e. optimal profit minus actual profit. However, this approach is homogeneous of degree one in prices and, additionally, the value of the technical component is not independent of alternative optimal solutions of the additive model. For these reasons, Cooper, Pastor, Aparicio, and Borras (2011b) took up where Cooper et al. (1999) left off and proposed a normalized profit inefficiency measure, which can be decomposed into technical and allocative inefficiencies by means of the optimal value of the weighted additive model.Given the above discussion, there are two main objectives we pursue in this paper. First, since researchers are using additive-type models of technical efficiency for estimating profit inefficiency and productivity change, this paper is interested to endow the weighted additive model in DEA with a distance function structure. Second, this paper particularly shows that the traditional profit function is dually linked with the weighted additive model. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that so far only the dual correspondences of the profit function with the directional distance function (Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1998) and with the Hölder distance function (Briec & Lesourd, 1999) were known. Consequently, we establish a new dual correspondence limited to the DEA framework. To achieve both these objectives, we introduce the weighted additive distance function and resort to duality theory. The new approach proposed in this paper can also be useful, from the point of view of practice, to managers and policy makers in their decision making. Weighted additive models have been utilized by practitioners in order to determine technical inefficiency considering the Pareto-Koopmans definition of efficiency. Endowing the weighted additive model with a structure of distance function will allow practitioners to use the same measure in situations where market prices are available (overall inefficiency) or a panel data is accessible (productivity change), opening the field of application of the original weighted additive models in a natural way.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly detail the definition and properties of the weighted additive models in DEA. We introduce the definition and main properties of the weighted additive distance function in Section 3. In Section 4, the dual relationship between the weighted additive distance function and the profit function in DEA is shown. In Section 5, we present the conclusions.In this section, we briefly review the literature on the weighted additive model in Data Envelopment Analysis and its main properties. Nevertheless, before doing that we need to introduce some notation.Working in the usual DEA framework, let us consider n decision making units (DMUs) to be evaluated. DMUjconsumesxj=(x1j,…,xmj)∈R+mamounts of inputs for the production ofyj=(y1j,…,ysj)∈R+samounts of outputs. The relative efficiency of each DMU in the sample is assessed with reference to the so-called production possibility set, which can be non-parametrically constructed from the observations by assuming certain postulates (see Banker et al., 1984). Also, to implement the approach, we will hereafter assume Variable Returns to Scale (VRS).In this way, the production possibility set in DEA, T, can then be mathematically characterized as follows:(1)T={(x,y)∈R+m×R+s:x≥∑j=1nλjxj,y≤∑j=1nλjyj,∑j=1nλj=1,λj≥0,j=1,…,n}.In the production literature, we can find the concept of frontier linked to the notion of technology. Specifically, the weakly efficient frontier of T is defined as∂w(T):={(x,y)∈T:x^<x,y^>y⇒(x^,y^)∉T}. Following Koopmans (1951), in order to measure technical efficiency in the Pareto sense, isolating a certain subset of ∂w(T) is necessary. We are referring to the strongly efficient frontier of T, defined as∂s(T):={(x,y)∈T:x^≤x,y^≥y,(x^,y^)≠(x,y)⇒(x^,y^)∉T}. In words, ∂s(T) is the set of all the Pareto-Koopmans efficient points of T.To estimate technical inefficiency for DMU0 with data (x0, y0), one possibility is to solve the following weighted additive model (Lovell & Pastor, 1995).(2)WA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=Max∑i=1mwi−si0−+∑r=1swr+sr0+s.t.∑j=1nλj0xij+si0−≤xi0,i=1,…,m−∑j=1nλj0yrj+sr0+≤−yr0,r=1,…,s∑j=1nλj0=1,si0−≥0,i=1,…,msr0+≥0,r=1,…,sλj0≥0,j=1,…,n,wherew−=(w1−,…,wm−)∈R++mandw+=(w1+,…,ws+)∈R++sare weights representing the relative importance of unit inputs and unit outputs. Different paths can be followed in choosing such weights. One possibility selects them based on the observations. In this way, it is possible to achieve a dimensionless optimal value in (2), in the terminology followed by Lovell and Pastor (1995). This line has been somehow followed by Cooper et al. (1999) and Cooper et al. (2011a) to introduce the Range-Adjusted Measure (RAM) and the Bounded-Adjusted Measure (BAM), respectively.WA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=∑i=1mwi−si0−*+∑r=1swr+sr0+*where * denotes optimality, represents the technical inefficiency associated with DMU0. The weighted additive model maximizes a weighted ℓ1 distance from DMU0 to the efficient frontier, and thereby simultaneously increases outputs and reduces inputs. Also, sincesi0−*≥0,i=1,…,m, andsr0+*≥0,r=1,…,s, the value ofWA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)is bounded from below by zero. Additionally, by maximizing, the first two constraints in (2) are really binding at the optimum and, therefore, we could use equalities instead of inequalities for these two restrictions for inputs and outputs in (2). In this way, we may define the following linear combinations as the targets corresponding to the evaluated unit, i.e. the coordinates of the projection point on the frontier of T:xi0*=∑j=1nλj0*xij,i=1,…,m, andyr0*=∑j=1nλj0*yrj,r=1,…,s.Next we show two important properties of the weighted additive model. Proofs for these results can be found, for example, in Pastor et al. (1999).Proposition 1(x0, y0) ∈ ∂s(T) if and only ifWA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=0.Proposition 2Let(λ0*,s0−*,s0+*)be an optimal solution of (2). Then(x0*,y0*), defined asxi0*=∑j=1nλj*xij,i=1,…,m, andyr0*=∑j=1nλj*yrj,r=1,…,s, belongs to ∂s(T).The first result shows that the weighted additive model is able to characterize the Pareto-efficient frontier, whereas the second result establishes that the target point determined by program (2) is always on the strongly efficient frontier. This last feature contrasts to the usual performing of other measures as those derived from the radial models or the directional distance function.Finally, we want to show the linear dual problem of (2), which will be used later in the paper.(3)DWA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=Min∑i=1mvi0xi0−∑r=1sur0yr0+δ0s.t.∑i=1mvi0xij−∑r=1sur0yrj+δ0≥0,j=1,…,nvi0≥wi−,i=1,…,mur0≥wr+,r=1,…,s.The vectorsv0*=(v10*,…,vm0*)andu0*=(u10*,…,us0*), obtained as an optimal solution for (3), result in a set of shadow or implicit prices for inputs and outputs.Some well-known results of primal and dual programs of the weighted additive model are the following.Lemma 1If (x0, y0) ∈ T then the next statements hold.(a)Programs (2) and (3) are always feasible and bounded.There exists an optimal solution for program (2) and program (3).WA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=DWA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)≥0.Less known is the following lemma for the unusual case of using program (2) and (3) for evaluating a unit located out of the production possibility set T.Lemma 2If (x0, y0)∉T then the next statements hold.(a)Program (2) is infeasible (WA+(x0,y0,w−,w+):=−∞).Program (3) is not bounded (DWA+(x0,y0,w−,w+)=−∞).Proof(a) and (b) are trivial resorting to standard results in Linear Programming.□In the next section we endow the weighted additive model in DEA with a distance function structure.The mathematical representation of production possibility sets is a basic issue of interest in classical microeconomics (Varian, 1992). In order to represent a technology, it is usual to resort to a single equation including the production function, in the single output case, or the transformation function, in the general multi-output case. The existence of such an equation is not apparent (see Shephard, 1953). For this reason, among others, it seems useful to look for functions, each one satisfying a certain set of properties, which allow substitution alternatives between inputs and outputs to be easily identified. These functions are referred in the literature as distance functions.One of the more important contributions to the theory of distance functions is, without doubt, the work developed by Shephard (1953). This author introduced the well-known (Shephard's) input and output distance functions and established dual relations with the cost and the revenue functions, respectively. Later on, Färe and Primont (1995) developed a non-excessively natural dual correspondence between the oriented Shephard distance functions and the profit function. In recent years there has been an extensive interest in the duality theory and distance functions as may be easily confirmed. First, Luenberger (1992a, b) with the benefit and shortage functions and later Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1996, 1998) and Briec and Lesourd (1999), with the directional distance function and the Hölder distance function, respectively, have yielded a series of papers along this line. Another related paper is Briec and Garderes (2004), who tried to generalize Luenberger benefit function in the context of consumer theory. All of them share a common feature: when the distance function is used as a technical efficiency measure, the efficiency is determined resorting to the weakly efficient frontier instead of the strongly efficient frontier. In other words, the focus is not measuring Pareto-Koopmans efficiency.In this section, we introduce a new distance function, based fundamentally on the weighted additive model of DEA, and show its main properties. In contrast to existing approaches, when this new distance function is utilized for evaluating a set of DMUs using their contemporaneous technology, the distance is determined with respect to the strongly efficient frontier of the reference production technology, something that is not usual in the literature33The most famous distance functions in the literature project the assessed units onto the weakly efficiency frontier when the measurement of technical efficiency is the focus (i.e. when the aim is to evaluate a set of DMUs regarding their contemporaneous production technology). We are referring to the Shephard input and output distance functions and the directional distance function. However, the weighted additive distance function, introduced here, is not the unique approach that projects the evaluated units onto the strongly efficient frontier when the objective is determining technical efficiency. In particular, in this context, the slacks-based measure of efficiency based on directional distance functions always yields Pareto-Koopmans projection points (see, for example, Färe & Grosskopf, 2010 and Skevas et al., 2012)..Before introducing the new distance function, we want to define the counterpart of program (2), the traditional weighted additive model, to be used for evaluating units located out of the reference technology.Let(xk,yk)∈R+m+sbe an input–output vector so that (xk, yk)∉T. Then, its ‘distance’ to the frontier of T measured in terms of a weighted additive function may be calculated by means of the following program.(4)WA−(xk,yk,w−,w+):=Max∑i=1mwi−sik−+∑r=1swr+srk+s.t.∑j=1nλjkxij+sik−≤xik,i=1,…,m−∑j=1nλjkyrj+srk+≤−yrk,r=1,…,s∑j=1nλjk=1,sik−≤0,i=1,…,msrk+≤0,r=1,…,sλjk≥0,j=1,…,n.The difference between the formulations of (2) and (4) is that the slacks are non-negative in the original weighted additive model and the slacks must be non-positive in (4) to project the exterior point (xk, yk) onto the frontier of T.Next, we illustrate how programs (2) and (4) perform by means of a simple numerical example with an only input and an only output, illustrated graphically by Fig. 1. In this situation units A = (1.1), B = (1.5.2) and C = (3.2.5) determine the frontier of the production possibility set and let us suppose thatw1−=w1+=1. If unit D = (3.0.5), located in the interior of the reference technology, is evaluated by program (2), we get that the optimal value is 3 and the projection point is B. Any other point of the strongly efficient frontier, which corresponds to the bold solid line consisting of two segments (AB and BC), is further from unit D than unit B. Regarding the exterior point E = (0.5.1.5), its evaluation through (4) yields an optimal value of −0.75 and the projection point E’ = (1.25.1.5), which curiously coincides with the frontier point closest to the assessed unit E. In this way, we point out that for assessed units that are in the reference technology the traditional weighted additive model (2) maximizes slacks, generating the furthest targets. In contrast, model (4) minimizes slacks and yields closest targets for units that are outside the reference technology, since in this scenariosik−,srk+≤0, ∀i, r and∑i=1mwi−sik−+∑r=1swr+srk+≤0, which means that program (4) is maximizing something non-positive and, consequently, we are searching slacks as close to zero as possible. This peculiar philosophy has already been supported in the DEA literature for another context and a different approach: “…the DMUs below and above the frontier follow different paradigms. For the DMUs located below the frontier, those closer to the frontier are evaluated as being more efficient, however for the DMUs above the frontier regarded as being less efficient. In other words, in this case the DMU located furthest away from the frontier is the most efficient.” (Arabi, Munisamy, & Emrouznejad, 2015, p. 31).On the other hand, the linear dual problem of (4) is as follows.(5)DWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=Min∑i=1mvikxik−∑r=1surkyrk+δks.t.∑i=1mvikxij−∑r=1surkyrj+δk≥0,j=1,…,n0≤vik≤wi−,i=1,…,m0≤urk≤wr+,r=1,…,s.The next two lemmas will be used later in the text.Lemma 3If (xk, yk)∉T then the next statements hold.(a)Programs (4) and (5) are always feasible and bounded.There exists an optimal solution for program (4) and program (5).WA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=DWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)≤0.Proof(a) We first prove that (5) is feasible and bounded. Using the first constraint in (5), we have thatδk≥∑r=1surkyrj−∑i=1mvikxij,j=1,…,n, which implies thatδk≥maxj=1,…,n{∑r=1surkyrj−∑i=1mvikxij}. Then,δk≥maxj=1,…,n{−∑i=1mwi−xij}sincevik≤wi−,i=1,…,mand urk≥ 0,r=1,…,s. Consequently, regarding the value that can take the objective function,∑i=1mvikxik−∑r=1surkyrk+δk≥−∑r=1swr+yrk+maxj=1,…,n{−∑i=1mwi−xij}since vik≥ 0,i=1,…,mandurk≤wr+,r=1,…,s. In this way, program (5), which minimizes the objective function, is necessarily bounded. On the other hand, let any vik> 0,i=1,…,mand urk> 0,r=1,…,s. We then defineδk:=maxj=1,…,n{∑i=1mvikxij−∑r=1surkyrj}. In this way, (vk, uk, δk) satisfies that∑i=1mvikxij−∑r=1surkyrj+δk≥0,for allj=1,…,n. We define(v′k,u′k,δ′k)=γ(vk,uk,δk)withγ=(max{v1kw1−,…,vmkwm−,u1kw1+,…,uskws+})−1>0and note that∑i=1mv′ikxij−∑r=1su′rkyrj+δk′≥∑i=1mγvikxij−∑r=1sγurkyrj+γδk=γ(∑i=1mvikxij−∑r=1surkyrj+δk)≥0for allj=1,…,n. Additionally,vik′=γvik=vikmax{v1kw1−,…,vmkwm−,u1kw1+,…,uskws+}≤vikvik/wi−≤wi−,i=1,…,m, andurk′=γurk=urkmax{v1kw1−,…,vmkwm−,u1kw1+,…,uskws+}≤urkurk/wr+≤wr+,r=1,…,m. Therefore, (v′k, u′k, δ′k) is a feasible solution of (5). Finally, applying the existing relationships between primal and dual programs in Linear Programming, we have that programs (4) and (5) are always feasible and bounded. In the same way, the proof of (b) and (c) are trivial using part (a) of Lemma 3 and, in the case of (c), by the non-positivity constraints in (4). □Lemma 4If (xk, yk) ∈ T then programs (4) and (5) are always feasible, bounded andWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=DWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0.ProofIf (xk, yk) ∈ T, by (1),∃λk′=(λ′1k,…,λ′nk)∈R+nwith∑j=1nλ′jk=1such thatxik≥∑j=1nλ′jkxij,i=1,…,mandyrk≤∑j=1nλ′jkyrj,r=1,…,s. Therefore,(λ′k,sk′−,sk′+)withsik′−=0,i=1,…,m, andsrk′+=0,r=1,…,s, is a feasible solution of program (4). On the other hand, note that the objective function in (4)∑i=1mwi−sik−+∑r=1swr+srk+≤0sincesik−≤0,i=1,…,m, andsrk+≤0,r=1,…,s. Hence, the maximization program defined in (4) is necessarily bounded and(λ′k,sk′−,sk′+)is an optimal solution of (4). Regarding program (5), in Linear Programming, if either the primal or the dual problem has an optimal solution, then so does the other, and the two optimal values are equal (see Theorem A.3(i) on page 445 in Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007). Consequently, program (5) is feasible, bounded and, finally,WA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=DWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0.□Now, we are ready to introduce the weighted additive distance function (WADF) for evaluating a non-necessarily observed input-output vector(xk,yk)∈R+m+swith respect to the technology constructed from the observed dataset{(xj,yj)}j=1,…,nas follows.(6)Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+):=max{WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+),WA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)}.The WADF is the maximum maximorum between the optimal value of program (2) and the optimal value of program (4). There are two possible scenarios. If (xk, yk) ∈ T then, by Lemma 1, program (2) is feasible and bounded with an optimal value greater or equal to zero and, by Lemma 4, program (4) is also feasible with an optimal value equals zero. Consequently, in this case,Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)coincides withWA+(xk,yk,w−,w+). Otherwise, if (xk, yk)∉T, we have thatWA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=−∞by Lemma 2 and, by Lemma 3, program (4) is feasible and bounded. Therefore, in this second case,Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)coincides withWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+).The way of obtaining the value ofDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)is to solve two optimization programs: models (2) and (4). Nevertheless, there is an equivalent way of determining its value in a single step through a mixed integer linear program (MILP), model (7). This new model takes advantage of the similarities between models (2) and (4). Both models are identical except in the sign of the slacks. In this way, model (7) uses the same constraints as models (2) and (4) and an additional binary decision variable, αk, which determines the sign of the slacks. Ifαk=1, then the slacks are non-negative and model (7) is equivalent to solving model (2). Otherwise, ifαk=0, then the slacks are non-positive and (7) is equivalent to solving model (4).(7)Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=max∑i=1mwi−sik−+∑r=1swr+srk+s.t.∑j=1nλjkxij+sik−≤xik,i=1,…,m(7.1)−∑j=1nλjkyrj+srk+≤−yrk,r=1,…,s(7.2)∑j=1nλjk=1,(7.3)sik−≤Mαk,i=1,…,m(7.4)sik−≥M(αk−1),i=1,…,m(7.5)srk+≤Mαk,r=1,…,s(7.6)srk+≥M(αk−1),r=1,…,s(7.7)αk∈{0,1},(7.8)λjk≥0,j=1,…,n,(7.9)where M is a sufficiently large positive number.Model (7) follows the spirit of the traditional weighted additive model, where a weighted sum of slacks is maximized. Regarding the constraints, the idea behind the preceding program is the following. Constraints (7.1)–(7.3) are identical to the first three restrictions in (2) and (4). However, in (7) the slacks are free. Additionally, ifαk=1then (7.4) and (7.5) are translated in0≤sik−≤M,∀i=1,…,m, and (7.6) and (7.7) in0≤srk+≤M,∀r=1,…,s. In this first scenario, all the slacks are non-negative as in the original model (2) and the objective function also takes non-negative values. Ifαk=0then (7.4) and (7.5) are equivalent to−M≤sik−≤0,∀i=1,…,m, and (7.6) and (7.7) to−M≤srk+≤0,∀r=1,…,s. In this last case, all the slacks are non-positive and the corresponding objective function is also non-positive. The first scenario comes into play when the evaluated point, (xk, yk), is inside the reference technology, whereas the second option when (xk, yk) is located out of the production possibility set. Since both scenarios are excluding, we have that the sign of the optimal value of (7) will determine whether (xk, yk) belongs to T or not.Now we turn to the characterization of the production possibility set. We next prove that the WADF characterizes the points of T through a proposition.Proposition 3Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)≥0if and only if (xk, yk) ∈ T.ProofBy (6) and the signs of the optimal values of (2) and (4), if (xk, yk) ∈ T thenDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)≥0. Otherwise, If (xk, yk)∉T thenDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=WA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)≤0. Let us suppose thatWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0. By Lemma 3(b), there exist optimal solutions for (4). In this case, any optimal solution(λk,sk−,sk+)satisfies thatsik−=0,i=1,…,m, andsrk+=0,r=1,…,s. But then, the first three constraints in (4) imply that∃λk=(λ1k,…,λnk)∈R+nwith∑j=1nλjk=1such thatxik≥∑j=1nλjkxij,i=1,…,mandyrk≤∑j=1nλjkyrj,r=1,…,s, which means that (xk, yk) ∈ T by (1). This is the contradiction that we were seeking. Therefore, if (xk, yk)∉T thenDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)<0.□Proposition 3 characterizes the belonging to the reference production technology by the sign of the WADF. This means that the new distance function is able to determine whether the evaluated point is inside or outside the production possibility set used for the corresponding assessment. This result is of little importance for studies where the main objective is to evaluate the technical efficiency of a set of DMUs assuming that these observations use the same production technology. However, Proposition 3 can be relevant in situations where the estimation of productivity change and its usual components is the focus since, in this case, the determination of the so-called mixed-period distance functions, which reflect the distance of a data point in time period t relative to the technology of period t+1 and vice versa, is a must both in the Malmquist index and in the Luenberger indicator.On the other hand, as we mentioned in Section 2, the traditional weighted additive measure in DEA characterizes the strongly efficient frontier of T. The same property is inherited by the WADF, as the following result states.Proposition 4(xk, yk) ∈ ∂s(T) if and only ifDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0.ProofOn the one hand, if (xk, yk) ∈ ∂s(T) then (xk, yk) ∈ T andDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+). Then, by Proposition 1,WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0and, consequently,Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0. On the other hand, by (6) ifDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0then we have only two cases. (i)WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0andWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)≤0. In this case, regardless of the value ofWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+),Dwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+). In this way,WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0and, by Proposition 1, (xk, yk) ∈ ∂s(T). (ii)WA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=−∞since program (2) is infeasible andWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0. However, the infeasibility of (2) implies that (xk, yk)∉T (Lemma 1(a)) andWA−(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0implies that (xk, yk) ∈ T, using similar arguments to the proof of Proposition 3. Consequently, we find a contradiction, which means that the only possible case is (i) and, therefore, ifDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=0then (xk, yk) ∈ ∂s(T).□However, a property that the WADF fails to satisfy is that established for the weighted additive measure in Proposition 2. In particular, the projection point determined by program (7),xik*=∑j=1nλjk*xij,i=1,…,m, andyrk*=∑j=1nλjk*yrj,r=1,…,s, is not always on the strongly efficient frontier in the case of evaluating an input–output vector (xk, yk) that does not belong to the reference technology. This situation is illustrated by Fig. 2. There, unit F is projected onto F’ by means of program (7), which is a point of the frontier of T but it is not a Pareto-Koopmans point.The new distance function defined in this section behaves as the well-known weighted additive model, a technical inefficiency measure, when a DMU belonging to the reference technology is evaluated. In addition, another interesting feature of the WADF is that it characterizes the belonging or not belonging to the technology by the sign of the function, as happens with the directional distance function. This feature easily allows measuring productivity change over time; even in the case of cross-period evaluation when a unit observed in period t+1 under assessment is outside the technology corresponding to period t.Another interesting feature of the WADF is feasibility. This characteristic is not as usual as we could expect for a distance function. In particular, in a DEA context and under the assumption of VRS, both the Shephard input distance function and the Shephard output distance function may be infeasible for intertemporal analysis. This weakness is translated into a problem of indetermination in the case of the traditional Malmquist productivity index when measuring returns to scale change is the aim. For the directional distance function, this drawback also holds. The infeasibility of the directional distance function has implications on, for example, the Luenberger indicator when it is used for measuring productivity change over time (Briec & Kerstens, 2009a, 2009b). In contrast, the WADF is always feasible thanks to Lemma 1 for input–output vectors belonging to the reference technology and by Lemma 3 for input–output vectors outside the production possibility set.In the next section we show that the WADF has additionally a dual relationship with the profit function.The Shephard input and output distance functions are associated through duality theory with two different optimization problems. The Shephard input distance function is related to cost minimization, whereas the Shephard output distance function is associated with revenue maximization. These relationships make them components in the cost and revenue measures of overall efficiency. Specifically, cost efficiency may be multiplicatively decomposed into the Shephard input distance function and an input allocative term. A similar breakdown holds for the revenue measure of overall efficiency. These results are, indeed, known from Shephard (1953). However, until the nineties there was no known simple natural dual relationship between distance functions and the profit function. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost and, consequently, it has a natural additive structure that does not fit well with the ‘multiplicative’ Shephard's distance functions. At this respect, the missing link between the profit function and duality in production theory was the directional distance function (Chambers et al., 1998)44See also Briec and Lesourd (1999).. This function has the necessary structure to provide the dual to the profit function and is the basis for a suitable and natural decomposition of overall inefficiency into technical and allocative inefficiencies. What is unknown is that the directional distance function is not the only distance function having a dual relationship with the profit function, at least in the context of Data Envelopment Analysis. Particularly, we prove in this section that the weighted additive distance function is also dually linked with the profit function. The results shown in this section are a straightforward consequence of the results presented in the previous sections.First of all, we show a ‘dual’ way of viewing the weighted additive distance function.Proposition 5Dwa(xk,yk;w−,w+)=max{DWA+(xk,yk;w−,w+),DWA−(xk,yk;w−,w+)}.ProofThe proof is trivial invoking Lemmas 1, 2, 3, 4 and definition (6).□Before proving the first result about duality between the WADF and the profit function, let us remember the mathematical expression of the profit function, here denoted as Π(c, p) for input and output market pricesc∈R++mandp∈R++s, and let us also show a lemma that will be necessary to our proofs.(8)Π(c,p):=maxx,y{∑r=1spryr−∑i=1mcixi:(x,y)∈T}.In the case of DEA under variable returns to scale, it is well-known thatΠ(c,p)=maxj=1,…,n{∑r=1spryrj−∑i=1mcixij}.Lemma 5(a)Let(v0*,u0*,δ0*)be an optimal solution of program (3) for (x0, y0) ∈ T, thenδ0*=Π(v0*,u0*).Let(vk*,uk*,δk*)be an optimal solution of program (5) for (xk, yk)∉T, thenδk*=Π(vk*,uk*).ProofSee Lemma 1 in Cooper et al. (2011b).□The constraints of program (7) show how the WADF can be determined from the knowledge of the technology in the input-output space. Alternatively, and as a first duality result, we next prove that the Weighted Additive Distance Function can be recovered from the information of the profit function in the price space.Theorem 1Dwa(xk,yk;w−,w+)=max{min{Π(vk,uk)−(∑r=1surkyrk−∑i=1mvikxik):vik≥wi−,∀i,urk≥wr+,∀r},min{Π(vk,uk)−(∑r=1surkyrk−∑i=1mvikxik):0≤vik≤wi−,∀i,0≤urk≤wr+,∀r}}.ProofThe proof is trivial invoking Lemma 5, Proposition 5 and using models (3) and (5).□It is easy to prove that if(xk,yk)∈TDwa(xk,yk,w−,w+)=DWA+(xk,yk,w−,w+)=min{Π(vk,uk)−(∑r=1surkyrk−∑i=1mvikxik):vik≥wi−,∀i,urk≥wr+,∀r}. Additionally, the set of constraintsvik≥wi−,∀i,urk≥wr+,∀ris mathematically equivalent tomin{v1w1−,…,vmwm−,u1w1+,…,usws+}≥1. Given input and output market pricesc∈R++mandp∈R++s, it is possible that these prices do not satisfy directly the constraintsci≥wi−,∀i,pr≥wr+,∀r, however, multiplying(min{c1w1−,…,cmwm−,p1w1+,…,psws+})−1by the original market prices c and p we obtain a new normalized prices(c¯,p¯)that meet the constraintsc¯i≥wi−,∀i,p¯r≥wr+,∀r. Then, using that(c¯,p¯)is a feasible solution of the minimization problemmin{Π(vk,uk)−(∑r=1surkyrk−∑i=1mvikxik):vik≥wi−,∀i,urk≥wr+,∀r}, we get thatΠ(c¯,p¯)−(∑r=1sp¯ryrk−∑i=1mc¯ixik)≥Dwa(Xk,Yk;W−,W+), which is equivalent to (see Cooper et al., 2011b):(9)Π(c,p)−(∑r=1spryrk−∑i=1mcixik)min{c1w1−,…,cmwm−,p1w1+,…,psws+}︸ProfitInefficiency(PI)≥Dwa(Xk,Yk;W−,W+)︸TechnicalInefficiency(TI).Expression (9) is a Fenchel–Mahler inequality (Färe & Primont, 1995).Now we turn on the derivation of the second duality result between the WADF and the profit function. We next show that the profit function can be recovered from the WADF through a suitable optimization problem in the input-output space.Theorem 2Letc∈R++mandp∈R++s. Then, the profit function can be calculated asΠ(c,p)=max{max(x,y)∈T{∑r=1spryr−∑i=1mcixi+Dwa(xk,yk;w−,w+)×min{c1w1−,…,cmwm−,p1w1+,…,psws+}},max(x,y)∉T{∑r=1spryr−∑i=1mcixi+Dwa(xk,yk;w−,w+)×max{c1w1−,…,cmwm−,p1w1+,…,psws+}}}.ProofThe proof is trivial invoking Theorem 1, Proposition 4 and using that the profit function is homogeneous of degree +1.□

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, the weighted additive distance function has been introduced and related to the well-known weighted additive model in DEA, when measuring technical inefficiency is the focus, and to the profit function by duality theory, when market prices come into play. In this last sense, we have proved that the directional distance function is not the only natural link between profit function and a distance function, at least in a DEA context.Regarding the implications of the results of this paper, we note two points. From a practical point of view, we have endowed the weighted additive model with a distance function structure, which takes negative values for points located outside the technology and non-negative values for points into the production possibility set. In this respect, the weighted additive distance function methodologically supports the branch of the literature that resorts to the weighted additive model or some related approach to measure productivity over time (see, for example, Mahlberg & Sahoo, 2011 or Chang et al., 2012). From a theoretical point of view, we have provided a new distance function with some interesting properties in contrast to the usual ones, mainly (1) when technical inefficiency has to be estimated, the weighted additive distance function coincides with the weighted additive model, which means that technical inefficiency is measured following the Pareto-Koopmans notion of efficiency; and (2) when productivity has to be determined and decomposed over time the weighted additive distance function emerges as an attractive tool to be used for cross-period evaluation of returns to scale changes, since this distance function is always feasible, even under Variable Returns to Scale.Finally, we highlight some possible future lines of research. One interesting possibility would be to extend our results to a wider class of production technologies satisfying general postulates (convexity, closeness, etc.). It could lead to extend the weighted additive distance function to the parametric world, providing a new tool for measuring technical efficiency, profit efficiency and productivity change with statistical bases. Another good avenue for further follow-up research would be the definition of some Luenberger-type indicator for estimating productivity change over time based on the weighted additive distance function and its application on some real-life dataset. In this way, the comparison of the obtained results with those determined through the traditional Luenberger indicator based on the directional distance function could be also an interesting future line of research.
