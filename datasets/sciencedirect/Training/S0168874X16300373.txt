@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Micron-scale spacing of interleaved electrodes and high-dielectric ceramics in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) provide exceptionally high capacitances in small volumes. This has led to MLCCs being the preferred type of capacitor in a wide range of applications where size and weight are critical factors. However, crack-related failures of MLCCs remain a significant issue. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and resonant nonlinear ultrasonics are being pursued as nondestructive techniques for detecting subsurface cracks that can evolve into performance-degrading electrical pathways during service. This paper presents finite-element calculations of the vibrational modes of MLCCs. The geometric symmetry in the finite-element model was orthorhombic, with three orthogonal mirror planes, and the detailed internal structure of interleaved metallic and ceramic materials was included in the model. The assumption of three mirror planes enabled an analysis of the normal modes of the full model through calculations on a mesh spanning just one eighth of the full volume. The computational load was further reduced by separating the problem into eight modal-symmetry sets with different boundary conditions for each set. The first three non-zero frequencies are presented for each modal symmetry set. In addition, displacement plots are presented for the two or three lowest-frequency modes of each symmetry set. These results provide information on the frequency ordering and symmetries of vibrational modes that can be used in the analysis of ultrasonic resonance measurements of MLCCs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The development and commercialization of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) has been a significant factor leading to reductions in size of a wide variety of electrical circuits, because the micron-scale spacing of interleaved electrodes and high-dielectric ceramics in MLCCs provides exceptionally high capacitance in small volumes. However, there are challenges with enhancing the reliability of MLCCs associated with the intrinsic vulnerability of the dielectric ceramic material to cracking under stress during manufacture, soldering, and service [1]. Although relatively rare, crack-related failures of MLCCs remain a significant issue, especially in applications where the repercussions of failure can be catastrophic or replacement is impossible, costly, or dangerous, as in implantable medical devices and spacecraft.Established methods for screening MLCCs for flaws before and after their incorporation in electrical circuits include visual inspection and measurements of electrical leakage current [1]. However, these methods are ineffective at detecting the presence of subsurface cracks that can evolve into performance-degrading electrical pathways during service [1–3]. This situation has motivated research on acoustic inspection methods that are sensitive to internal structure. Such research has included work on scanning acoustic microscopy, scanning laser acoustic microscopy, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), electromechanical resonance spectroscopy employing swept-frequency impedance analysers, and tone-burst electromechanical resonance [2–10].Two published studies of MLCCs have included finite-element (FE) modeling of resonant vibrational modes to support the interpretation of experimental spectra [6,9]. Prume et al. [6] calculated FE impedance spectra with piezoelectric and dielectric terms included in the equation of motion and the excitation provided through direct ferroelectric coupling to electric fields applied to the internal interleaved electrodes. The transduction mechanism in this model and corresponding impedance measurements introduces restrictions on the excited modal symmetries. Capacitors with industrial size designations of 1210 and 1812 were included in these models, and the effects of delaminations and idealized cracks with two different orientations were explored through comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Johnson et al. [9] reported FE normal-mode spectra and displacement patterns for several resonant modes near the dominant experimentally measured resonant peaks of smaller type-0603 MLCCs driven with ferroelectric excitation. The FE model in that study did not include ferroelectric excitation or piezoelectric/dielectric terms in the equation of motion.The current paper presents FE calculations of acoustic normal modes of all symmetry types, based on an MLCC model with dimensions and internal structure approximately matching those previously reported for a set of type-1210 MLCCs [10]. Internal interleaved layers of electrodes and ceramic are explicitly included in the model, although the geometry of these layers is approximated as orthorhombic to reduce the size of the computational problem (as in the work of Prume et al. [6]). Piezoelectric and dielectric terms are not included in the equation of motion. The inclusion of all modal symmetries in the model is anticipated to facilitate interpretation of RUS measurements, which are not limited to excitation of specific symmetries. The research reported here is specifically associated with experimental work that has been reported elsewhere on the detection of cracks in MLCCs through RUS [8] and tone-burst electromechanical resonance [10].The geometry in the FE model considered here is shown in Fig. 1and is based on measurements reported by Johnson et al. [10] for a set of type-1210 MLCCs manufactured by Vishay Intertechnology with model number of VJ1210Y474KXAAT.11Identification of this commercial product is provided for technical completeness and does not reflect an endorsement by NIST.The three exterior surfaces of the capacitor shown in Fig. 1(b) are defined for the purpose of describing the displacement pattern results. The endcap surface (with surface-normal vector in they^direction) is Surface 1, the larger capacitor surface (with surface-normal vector in thez^direction) is Surface 2, and the smaller capacitor surface (with surface-normal vector in thex^direction) is Surface 3. As described by Johnson et al. [10], the 70 electrodes in the core of the physical MLCC have a thickness of 2.0μm and a periodicity of 16.38μm, corresponding to a total thickness of 1.132mm for the interleaved core region. The width and length of the internal electrodes are 2.068mm and 2.852mm, respectively, and connect alternately to the two metallic endcaps of the MLCC. The electrodes are surrounded by a ceramic filler material (a typical dielectric for MLCCs described in a subsequent section) with overall dimensions of 2.474mm, 3.040mm, and 1.414mm. The endcaps each consist of three metallic layers. The thicknesses of the metallic layers from outside to inside (tin, nickel, and silver, respectively) are 15.0μm, 9.0μm, and 7.0μm, for a total summed thickness on one end of 31.0μm, resulting in final overall dimensions of 2.536mm, 3.102mm, and 1.476mm in thex^,y^, andz^directions, respectively, shown in Fig. 1.The nominal symmetry of the physical MLCCs is monoclinic (corresponding to the group-theoretical point group C2hin the Schoenflies notation), with one mirror plane (y−z) and a two-fold rotation axis (x^) normal to this plane [11]. The exterior surfaces of the physical MLCC, as depicted in Fig. 1(b), have a higher symmetry corresponding the orthorhombic point group D2h, with three mirror planes and corresponding two-fold rotation axes and inversion symmetry [11]. The reduced symmetry of the full capacitor arises from the fact that alternating connections of the even number of internal electrodes to the endcaps eliminates two of the mirror planes. In this study, this reduction in symmetry of the physical MLCC is neglected, and the total symmetry of the capacitor is approximated as D2h. This approximation of higher symmetry is implemented in the model by having the electrodes in the model alternately connect to either both endcaps or neither endcap, rather than alternately to one or the other endcap as in the physical capacitor. This is equivalent to shifting the location of a portion of the internal electrode material near the endcaps by one period (16.38μm) of the interleaved structure. The effect of this approximation is expected to be insignificant because (1) it shifts the position of electrode material by only a small fraction of the exterior dimensions, (2) it does not change the relative volumes of the materials in the capacitor and (3) it does not lead to an introduction or splitting of degenerate modes, because there are no degeneracies in either the C2hor the D2hpoint groups. Also, the thicknesses of the ceramic material above and below the core region of the physical MLCCs can vary from capacitor to capacitor. For simplicity, it was assumed for the mesh that the x–y midplane falls exactly between two layers. Therefore, because the mesh assumes symmetry across the x–y reflection plane, an electrode with double the thickness appears at the very center of the mesh, and this feature does not exist in the physical MLCC. Again, because this assumption does not change the volume fraction of the materials, it is a useful approximation that significantly reduces the size of the computational problem.The D2hsymmetry of the model enables the FE calculations to be performed on only one octant of the MLCC (as shown in Fig. 1), with boundary conditions specified to match the specified modal symmetries. This resulted in a mesh with 75 total layers of elements in thez^direction within the octant. The curved bottom ceramic region was modeled with 5 layers of elements through the thickness. Each pair of electrode and ceramic layers (every 16.38μm) was modeled with two elements through the thickness, resulting in 70 total layers of elements for the core region, 35 including both dielectric and electrode materials and 35 with only dielectric material. As described below, the endcaps have a relatively small effect on the frequencies. Therefore, highly exact modeling of the endcaps is assumed not to be critical, and, to save on computational time, the endcaps were modeled with only one element through the thickness of each metallic endcap layer. The capacitor octant mesh has overall dimensions of 1.268mm, 1.551mm, and 0.738mm in thex^,y^, andz^directions, respectively. These values are half of the overall dimensions given for the whole capacitor. A generally square mesh was implemented for the layers, with the corners modeled with triangular wedge elements extending radially. This mesh geometry is shown in Fig. 1. A convergence study to determine the appropriate refinement of this core region of the mesh is described in a subsequent section. Triangular wedge elements were also used to connect the coarser portion of the mesh for the curved bottom ceramic region with the refined core region. The origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the full capacitor. The total volume of the meshed octant (one eighth of entire capacitor) is 1.369×10−9m3.The interior electrodes and interior layer of the endcaps are composed of silver (Ag), the second layer of the endcaps is a thin nickel (Ni) diffusion barrier, and the outer layer of the endcaps is tin (Sn). Doped polycrystalline barium titanate (BaTiO3), a typical dielectric for MLCCs, fills the spaces between the electrodes and the regions without electrodes near the surfaces of the capacitor.Dopant levels and corresponding elastic-stiffnesses of BaTiO3 used in MLCCs are dependent on the capacitor manufacturer [12]. Accurate ultrasonic measurements of elastic stiffnesses of individual MLCCs are very challenging, given the small volumes of ceramic regions without interleaved electrodes. Values of elastic stiffnesses of pure BaTiO3 that are employed here for finite-element calculations were derived through the use of the method of Kim [13] from sets of published room-temperature measurements of diagonal elements of elastic stiffness and compliance tensors. This approach avoids typically substantial uncertainties in reported off-diagonal elements of the tensors. Uncertainties in off-diagonal elements arise from the fact that these elements are not simply related to measurements of any pure mode of mechanical deformation [14,15]. Diagonal elements of the elastic stiffness tensor of pure BaTiO3 published by Zgonik et al. [16] and diagonal elements of the elastic compliance tensor published by Berlincourt and Jaffe [17] were used here to determine the single-crystal elastic stiffness constants C11, C33, C12, and C13 of BaTiO3 through the use of the method of Kim [13]. These elements of the stiffness tensor were then employed to estimate isotropic polycrystalline values through an arithmetic Voigt–Reuss–Hill average [18]. The resultant material properties for the BaTiO3-based ceramic are shear modulus of 56.6GPa, bulk modulus of 141.5GPa, Young׳s modulus of 149.8GPa, and Poisson ratio of 0.3235. These values were used to calculate the elastic stiffness constants listed in Table 1. The value for the density of BaTiO3 is that given by Urek and Drofenik [19]. Table 1 also lists the C11 and C44 values for Ag [20], Ni [21], and Sn. The values of the elastic constants for Sn are a simple average of values listed by Simmons and Wang [22] for their calculations of Voigt–Reuss aggregate averages using single-crystal constants that were measured by Rayne and Chandrasekhar [23].In this section, the weak form of the equations of motion of a homogeneous orthorhombic solid are derived to provide the basis for finite-element modeling [24], and the approximate displacements and numerical method are discussed. The equations are presented in terms of rectangular Cartesian coordinates, which enable the eigenvalue problem to be separated according to geometric and material symmetries. This drastically reduces the computational load involved in the finite-element calculations [25]. The three independent displacement components are expressed asu=u(x,y,z),v=v(x,y,z), andw=w(x,y,z), and correspond to displacements in thex^,y^, andz^directions, respectively. The general constitutive relation for the material can be expressed as(1){σ1σ2σ3σ4σ5σ6}=[C11C12C13000C12C22C23000C13C23C33000000C44000000C55000000C66]{ϵ1ϵ2ϵ3ϵ4ϵ5ϵ6}Here, σirepresents the components of stress in contracted notation, Cijthe components of the elastic stiffness tensor computed from the elastic properties listed in Table 1 and represented in standard matrix form [26], and ϵithe components of strain in contracted notation. The correspondence of the contracted notation and standard indicial notation for a second-order tensor is given, for the specific stress, elastic stiffness, and strain components, by σ1=σ11, σ2=σ22, σ3=σ33, σ4=σ23, σ5=σ13, σ6=σ12, C11=C1111, C12=C1122, C13=C1133, C22=C2222, C23=C2233, C33=C3333, C44=C2323, C55=C1313, C66=C1212, ϵ1=ϵ11, ϵ2=ϵ22,ϵ3=ϵ33,ϵ4=2ϵ23=γ23,ϵ5=2ϵ13=γ13, andϵ6=2ϵ12=γ12[27]. The representative directions defined by the subscripts will be identified for each case below.The relationships between strain and displacement are(2)ϵ1=∂u∂xϵ2=∂v∂yϵ3=∂w∂zϵ4=∂v∂z+∂w∂yϵ5=∂u∂z+∂w∂xϵ6=∂v∂x+∂u∂yHamilton׳s principle provides the starting point for each of the subsequent derivations.

Substitution of Eqs. (1) and (2) into Eq. (3) along with the assumption of harmonic motion for each of the displacement components gives the specific weak form of Hamilton׳s principle:(4)0=∫V[(C11∂u∂x+C12∂v∂y+C13∂w∂z)∂δu∂x+(C12∂u∂x+C22∂v∂y+C23∂w∂z)∂δv∂y+(C13∂u∂x+C23∂v∂y+C33∂w∂z)∂δw∂z+C44(∂v∂z+∂w∂y)(∂δv∂z+∂δw∂y)+C55(∂u∂z+∂w∂x)(∂δu∂z+∂δw∂x)+C66(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)(∂δu∂y+∂δv∂x)−ρω2(uδu+vδv+wδw)]dV.If necessary, these equations can be integrated by parts to give the differential equations of motion for the solid. These are not listed here.Approximate solutions to the weak form of the equations of motion given in the previous section can be generated using piecewise approximations of the three displacement components over small domains. This is accomplished by approximating the displacement components u, v, and w using finite linear combinations of the form:(5)u(x,y,z)=∑j=1nujϕju(x,y,z)δu=ϕiu(x,y,z)v(x,y,z)=∑j=1nvjϕjv(x,y,z)δv=ϕiv(x,y,z)w(x,y,z)=∑j=1nwjϕjw(x,y,z)δw=ϕiw(x,y,z)Here, ϕju, ϕjv, and ϕjware known functions of position that here are taken as the independent shape functions associated with a conventional 8-noded brick finite element [28], n is the number of terms in the approximation for the displacement components and the number of nodes per element, and uj, vj, and wjare the nodal values of the successive displacements at fixed geometric locations of the finite-element domain. In this study, these are located at the corners of each individual element [24].For the problem of free vibration, the boundary conditions are all of the natural type because all faces of the solid are stress free. In the finite element method, the natural boundary conditions are contained in the variational statement of the problem. Hence, there is no need to explicitly satisfy these conditions. Because of the layered nature of the capacitor, the usual conditions of displacement and traction continuity across a dissimilar material interface are satisfied, but in varying degrees. Specifically, the enforcement of displacement continuity across the interface is explicitly satisfied only at the nodal locations of the contiguous finite elements.In this study, the same form of approximation functions is used for each of the displacements. Given the geometric and material symmetry of the solids considered, the approximation functions can be grouped in such a manner that smaller eigenvalue problems can be uncoupled from one another and solved separately. By grouping the approximation functions into odd and even reflection classifications, the total problem can be uncoupled into eight smaller problems where the matrix is of order 81. The classifications employed here for orthorhombic symmetry will be described in detail in a subsequent section and are discussed by Ohno [29].Substitution of the approximate displacements and their variations into the weak forms and collection of terms allows for writing the equation to be solved in matrix form as:(6)[[K11][K12][K13][K21][K22][K23][K31][K32][K33]]{{a}{b}{d}}−ρω2[[M11][0][0][0][M22][0][0][0][M33]]{{a}{b}{d}}={{0}{0}{0}},where the explicit forms of the coefficient matrices are given in the Appendix. The required integration for each element is accomplished using Gauss quadrature [24]. The resulting eigenvalue problem is solved by the use of the QR algorithm [30] to provide both the frequencies and the eigenvectors containing the representation of the displacement patterns of vibration.As discussed in the previous section, for the problem of free vibration of a solid, the boundary conditions are all of the natural type and the natural boundary conditions are contained in the variational statement of the problem. Therefore, if the full capacitor were meshed, there would be no need to explicitly satisfy these conditions. However, because the mesh utilizes symmetry across three reflection planes and only one eighth of the MLCC is modeled, the analysis was completed using eight different boundary condition sets corresponding to the eight symmetry classifications. For the eight classifications, the displacements (u, v, and w) are either even (E) or odd (O) with respect to the three reflection planes [29], as summarized in Table 2. The “Subset” column of Table 2 lists the symmetry classifications in both Ohno׳s [29] notation and a common form of group-theoretical notation [31]. In group theory, these symmetry classifications correspond to the irreducible representations of the D2hpoint group, which is the orthorhombic point group with the most symmetry elements. For the remainder of this paper, Ohno׳s notation will be used. The last three columns of Table 2 list the symmetries of the displacement components with respect to the reflection planes with surface-normal vectors ofx^,y^, andz^.Different nodal degrees of freedom (DOF) were specified to zero for the boundary conditions of the eight subsets described in Table 2. The DOFs set to zero correspond to the displacements that are odd (O) with respect to reflection across the corresponding reflection planes. For example, the OD type has three sets of DOFs set to zero: u displacement of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in thex^direction, v displacement of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in they^direction, and w displacement of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in thez^direction. Similarly, the EX type has the following DOFs set to zero: v and w displacements of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in thex^direction, v displacement of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in they^direction, and w displacement of all nodes on the symmetry plane with the normal vector in thez^direction. A similar pattern follows for all “O” shown in Table 2.Several meshes were tested to study the effect of the endcaps and to perform a convergence study on the refinement of the mesh through the core region of electrodes. Studying the effect of the endcaps was important, because removing the endcaps from the mesh reduced the computational time required to analyze the capacitor and a convergence study could be performed more efficiently. It is also of interest to explore the effect of variations in the geometry of endcaps because visible variations in this geometry exist in physical capacitors. The effect that the endcaps had on the first mode frequencies of each subset is shown in Table 3. On average, the absence of the endcaps increased the first frequency of each symmetry classification by 3.4%. Therefore, the endcaps decrease the frequencies, which is expected with the addition of material.With the endcaps removed (3.77% volume decrease), a convergence study was performed on the mesh refinement of the layers. The first mesh tested consisted of 1748 elements and 2387 nodes, corresponding to a total of 7161 degrees of freedom. The number of elements per layer of the mesh was increased incrementally until less than a 1% change in frequencies was observed. The final mesh of the layers has over four times the number of degrees of freedom in comparison to the first mesh. After completion of the convergence study, the endcaps were added back to the model. The final mesh with endcaps, which was employed to obtain the frequency and mode shape results presented in the remainder of this paper, consists of 9550 elements and 10,435 nodes, corresponding to a total of 31,305 degrees of freedom. The reflection planes withx^,y^, andz^surface normals have 1039, 811, and 142 nodes, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Frequencies and associated vibrational modes of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) were investigated by finite-element (FE) calculations. The first three frequencies and two displacement plots were presented for the MLCCs. As previously noted, OD modes are of great importance for comparison to experimental results, because the third mode in this subset is the dominant mode excited through direct ferroelectric transduction [10]; therefore the third mode shape for this subset was presented.Conclusions of this study include:•The removal of the endcaps in the FE mesh (which was done to reduce computation time while refining the mesh of the core region) increased the lowest frequency mode of each symmetry classification by an average of 3.4%, which is consistent with the subtraction of material. This result indicates that resonant frequencies of physical MLCCs are not greatly affected by variations in endcap geometry.The flexural mode shapes follow a pattern of bending characterized by displacements on the bounding surfaces that act in a direction that is normal to the surface, vary in odd powers in one of the directions of the surface, and are approximately constant in the other direction. The lowest flexural mode is in the EZ subset (0.4742MHz) and corresponds to bending motion of Surface 2 about the weaker axis (x-axis) and rotation of Surface 1 about the x-axis.Modes with predominantly shear displacements occur in the OZ and OX subsets.The lowest frequency overall is 0.3543MHz is in the EV subset and is characterized by primarily torsional displacements.The frequencies presented range from 0.3543MHz to 0.8028MHz for the first frequency in each subset, 0.6914MHz to 1.2062MHz for the second frequency in each subset, and 0.9769MHz to 1.4184MHz for the third frequency in each subset.For all subsets, the average percent increase from first to second mode for the MLCC is 56.7% and the average percent increase from second to third mode is 29.8%.There is a 1.32% difference between the finite element calculations and the ferroelectric excitation experimental findings for the frequency of the third OD mode.These calculations of frequencies and mode shapes, which include all modal symmetries, will aid in interpreting RUS and resonant nonlinear ultrasonics measurements by enabling the identification of measured vibrational modes. They also provide a basis for exploring the dependence of resonant frequencies and nonlinear parameters on the location, size, and orientation of cracks. Therefore, the approach and results presented here are anticipated to serve a critical role in the development of nondestructive methods for detecting cracks in MLCCs and, thus, facilitating enhancements in the reliability of devices incorporating these capacitors.
