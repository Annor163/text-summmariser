@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we investigate multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems based on Frank triangular norms, in which the attribute values assume the form of hesitant fuzzy information. Firstly, some basic concepts of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and the Frank triangle norms are introduced. We develop some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on Frank operations, such as hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted average (HFFWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging (HFFOWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid averaging (HFFHA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (HFFWG) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (HFFOWG) operator, and hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid geometric (HFFHG) operator. Some essential properties together with their special cases are discussed in detail. Next, a procedure of multiple attribute decision making based on the HFFHWA (or HFFHWG) operator is presented under hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, a practical example that concerns the human resource selection is provided to illustrate the decision steps of the proposed method. The result demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the new method. A comparative analysis is also presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems are widespread in daily life decision situations. This process aims at selecting the best alternative(s) from a set of available alternatives with respect to multiple attributes, both qualitative and quantitative. Many MADM approaches are successfully used to web 2.0 [1], social network [2], and recommendation system [3,4]. In many real-world situations, due to the increasing complexity of the socio-economic environment, there are numerous limiting factors such as a lack of information and knowledge, uncertainty of the decision-making environment, difficulties in information extraction, etc. Therefore, it becomes difficult for decision maker to express values of attributes in a numeric fashion. Instead, it is more suitable to express preferences by fuzzy numbers or extended fuzzy numbers [5–8,14,16]. Many theoretical studies on MADM problems have been put forward in recent years. A variety of approaches about MADM under hesitant fuzzy environment have been developed [9–11,15,17,18]. Torra [12] proposed the concept of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS). HFS is an extension of fuzzy set which permits the membership grades assuming a set of possible values rather than a single one. As such HFS it can be considered as a powerful tool for handling fuzzy uncertain information. Torra and Narukawa [13] studied the relationship between the HFS and other extended fuzzy sets (FSs), the results showed that the envelope of HFS is an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), all the HFSs are type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS). Xu and Xia [19] proposed a series of distance and similarity measures for HFS, and further developed the hesitant ordered weighted distance measures and the hesitant ordered weighted similarity measures. Peng et al. [20] developed the generalized hesitant fuzzy synergetic weighted distance (GHFSWD) measure, and discussed some desirable properties together with their potential applications. Farhadinia [21] investigated the relationship between entropy, similarity measure and distance measure for HFS and the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS). Qian et al. [22] extended HFS by IFS and applied it in decision support system (DSS). Chen et al. [23] studied interval-valued hesitant preference relations and utilized it to group decision making (GDM) problems. Zhu et al. [24] proposed the concept of dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) and further investigated some basic operations and established a number of useful properties. Rodríguez et al. [25] introduced the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), which provides a linguistic the richness of linguistic elicitation based on the fuzzy linguistic approach. Zhang and Wei [26] developed the VIKOR method to solve the MADM problems with hesitant fuzzy information. Zhang and Xu [27,28] extended the TOPSIS and TODIM methods to accommodate hesitant fuzzy environment, and further produced two hesitant fuzzy decision making methods. Dong et al. [29] developed the consensus model with hesitant linguistic assessments in group decision making. Zhu and Xu [30] constructed some consistency measures for hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations. Wang and Xu [31] proposed the concept of extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations. In addition, the HFS and its various extended forms have been widely used in group decision making [32–35], preference relations [36], clustering analysis [37], and other applications [38–42]. Recently, Rodríguez et al. [43] presented an overview of HFS with the aim of providing a clear perspective on the different concepts, tools and trends related to this extension of FS. In addition, Xu [44] proposed a detailed survey to review on the recent development of aggregation techniques and applications for HFS, and further pointed out some potential trends in this field.In addition, as an important technique for information fusion, researches on hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators have been receiving more attention. Xia and Xu [45] proposed a series of aggregation operators and discussed their desirable properties in detail. Xia et al. [46] applied quasi-arithmetic means to form several series aggregation operators under hesitant fuzzy environment. Wei [47] developed some prioritized operators with hesitant fuzzy information, and applied them to handle MADM problems where the attributes exhibit different levels of priority. Wei et al. [48] investigated some hesitant interval-valued aggregation operators and developed a procedure to solve interval-valued hesitant fuzzy MADM problems. Motivated by the idea of fuzzy integral theory, Wei et al. [49] used the Choquet integral to derive two aggregation operators within the context of hesitant fuzzy information: hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging (HFCOA) operator and hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered geometric (HFCOG) operator. Those two aggregation operators are not only considering the importance of the attributes, but also can capture the correlations among the independent attributes. Zhu et al. [50] developed a hesitant fuzzy Bonferroni mean (BM) and utilized geometric Bonferroni mean (BM) to solve MADM problems. Zhang [51] presented a wide range of hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information, several interesting properties and the relationships between them were also discussed. Based on Archimedean t-conorms and t-norms, Zhang and Wu [52] developed two weighted hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators for aggregating weighted hesitant fuzzy information, some desirable properties and special cases of the proposed aggregation operators are studied in detail. Recently, Zhang et al. [53] proposed some induced generalized hesitant fuzzy operators and applied them to MADM problems. Liao and Xu [54] investigated some hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted aggregation operators and establish a decision algorithm to aid MADM problems with hesitant fuzzy information. Zhou and Xu [55] proposed two new aggregation approaches: optimal discrete fitting aggregation operator and simplified optimal discrete fitting aggregation operator to resolve GDM problems. Wei et al. [56] defined two aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS): the hesitant fuzzy LWA operator and the hesitant fuzzy LOWA operator, and applied them to solve MADM problems with different situations in which importance weights of criteria or experts are known or unknown. Yu [57] developed some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on Einstein operational laws. Tan et al. [58] proposed some hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators and applied them to MADM problems. Qin and Liu [59] developed some hesitant fuzzy operators based on Maclaurin symmetric mean and studied various desirable properties of them. Compared with hesitant fuzzy Bonferroni mean [60], the prominent feature of hesitant fuzzy MSM is that it can capture the overall interrelationships among the arguments, so it is more general and suitable for practical decision applications.All aforementioned aggregation operators are mainly based on the algebraic operational laws of general t-norms and their dual t-conorms [61]. The most widely used t-norm and t-conorm is product and probabilistic sum [61], because this pair of triangular norm is useful to carry out computing. However, the main drawbacks of the probability triangular norms are that lack of flexibility and robustness. To overcome these drawbacks, some aggregation operators based on other t-norms and t-conorms have been developed over the last decades. Xia et al. [62] extended some families of aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Wang and Liu [63] developed a family of intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation operators with the help of Einstein t-conorm and t-norm. Liu [64] investigated some Hamacher aggregation operators and discussed some of its desirable properties in detail. Wei and Zhao [65] explored some hesitant interval-valued fuzzy Einstein aggregation operators, such as the hesitant interval-valued fuzzy Einstein weighted average (HIVFEWA) operator, hesitant interval-valued fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric (HIVFEWG) operator, and the induced hesitant interval-valued fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted geometric (I-HIVFEOWG) operator, for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information.Frank t-norm and t-conorm [66], which are an interesting generalizations of probabilistic and Lukasiewicz t-norm and t-conorm, is a general and flexible family of continuous triangular norms. Since the Frank t-norm and t-conorm involve a certain parameter, this makes them more flexible in the process of information fusion and is more adequate to model practical decision making problems. Tomasa et al. [67] studied the functional equations of Frank and Alsina for two classes of commutative, associative and increasing binary operators. Yager [68] investigated the additive generating function (AGF) of Frank t-norms, and established a framework with Frank t-norms in approximate reasoning. Sarkoci [69] made a comparison between the Frank t-norms and the Hamacher t-norms, and proved that two different t-norms form the same family. Casasnovas and Torrens [70] presented an axiomatic approach to scalar cardinality of Frank t-norms and proved that the properties remain true for other standard t-norms. Deschrijver [71] introduced the extensions operations to the lattice of closed interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) based on Frank t-norms and provided necessary and sufficient conditions such that the these operations can formed a complete algebraic lattice structure. Some researchers also studied various mathematical properties of the Frank t-norms [72–76].It is noted that the previous research works almost exclusively focus on the mathematical structure and the properties of the Frank t-norms, while application-oriented studies are quite rare, especially in the context of information fusion and decision-making. We have shown that the HFS can be suitable to express uncertain information, and the Frank aggregation operators themselves extend the probabilistic and Lukasiewicz t-norms with the aid of parameter flexibility. In this sense, it becomes meaningful to extend the Frank t-norms to cope with the hesitant fuzzy environment. To date, we have not seen any related studies of aggregation operators based on Frank t-norms in problems of hesitant fuzzy decision-making problems. Motivated by this fact, it becomes beneficial to study a family of aggregation operators based on Frank operations with regard to hesitant fuzzy information and subsequently apply them to multiple attribute decision making problems. Those are the two strong motivating factors behind the study reported in this paper.There is also a certain point which needs to be highlighted. One might be under an impression that all hesitant fuzzy sets can be represented as type-2 fuzzy sets. However, in practical applications it is difficult to extend the type-2 fuzzy aggregation operator to hesitant fuzzy environment. The computations of type-2 fuzzy sets are complicated. Although we can define some operational laws for type-2 fuzzy sets, and extend these operations to develop some aggregation operators based on Frank t-norms, these results might have only theoretical value. The most challenging problem is that it is not easy to extend them to hesitant fuzzy sets. The reason is that the HFSs are not fully equivalent to T2FSs. They just can be regarded as approximate IT2FSs. Let us note that membership of HFS is a discrete set, while the primary membership is an interval. So, the membership of HFS can be viewed as a discrete primary membership of an IT2FSs, in which the second membership is equal to 1. Another reason is that we let parameter λ>1 instead of λ>0, so the existing Archimedes t-norms cannot cover this modified Frank t-norms. This change can lead to some desirable properties (monotonicity) to reflect the decision maker's attitude. Moreover, we have extended the Frank t-norms to interval type-2 fuzzy sets and derived some aggregation operators [78]. From this, it is obvious that the hesitant fuzzy Frank aggregation operators are not simple special cases of interval type-2 fuzzy Frank aggregation operators. In other words, the interval fuzzy Frank aggregation operators cannot reduce to hesitant fuzzy Frank aggregation operators. Therefore, it is meaningful to study some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on Frank t-norms. This is another objective of this study.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce some essential concepts of hesitant fuzzy sets and Frank t-norm and t-conorm. In Section 3, we define the Frank operation laws for HFS. In Sections 4 and 5, we develop some hesitant fuzzy Frank arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators, such as hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted average (HFFWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging (HFFOWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid weighted averaging (HFFHWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (HFFWG) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (HFFOWG) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid weighted geometric (HFFHWG) operator, furthermore, we also discuss some desirable properties. In Section 6, we utilize the hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid averaging (HFFHA) operator and hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid geometric (HFFHG) operator to develop some approaches for handling multiple attribute decision making problems in which the attribute values take the form of hesitant fuzzy information. In Section 7, an example of personnel selection is provided to illustrate the proposed method. Finally, some conclusions and future researches are outlined in Section 8.In this section, we briefly review some basic concepts of hesitant fuzzy set and Frank operations, which will be directly used in the next sections.Definition 1 [12]Let X be a universe of discourse. A hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) in X is in terms of a function that returns a subset of [0, 1]. For convenience, Xia and Xu [45] expressed the HFS in the form:(1)E={<x,hE(x)>|x∈X}where hE(x) indicates a set of some possible values in [0, 1], which denotes the possible membership degrees of the element x∈X. For convenience, h=hE(x) is called a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) and H be the set of all HFEs.To compare HFEs, Xia and Xu [45] defined the comparison laws as follows:Definition 2 [45]Let h be a HFE on X, s(h)=(1/#h)∑γ∈hγ is called the score function of h, where # is the number of elements in h. For two HFEs h1 and h2, if s(h1)>s(h2), then h1≻h2; if s(h1)=s(h2), then h1∼h2; if s(h1)<s(h2), then h1≺h2.For any three HFEs h, h1 and h2, Xia and Xu [45] defined some operations as follows:(1)hc=∪γ∈h{1−γ};h1∪h2=∪γ∈h1,γ∈h2max{γ1,γ2};h1∩h2=∩γ∈h1,γ∈h2min{γ1,γ2};;h1⊕h2=∪γ∈h1,γ∈h2{γ1+γ2−γ1γ2};h1⊗h2=∪γ∈h1,γ∈h2{γ1γ2};λh=∪γ∈h{1−(1−γ)λ}.As an important tool in information fusion, hesitant fuzzy aggregation operator has received more attention, Xu and Xia [45] proposed the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) operator and the hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (HFWG) operator as listed below:1)Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) operator is defined as:(2)HFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕j=1nωjhj=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), and ωj>0,∑j=1nωj=1.Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then the hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (HFWG) operator is defined as:(3)HFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕j=1nhjωj=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∏j=1nγjωjwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), and ωj>0,∑j=1nωj=1.The triangular norms have been intensively studied, starting from Zadeh introduced max and min operation as a pair of triangular norm and triangular conorm. We can refer to various triangular norms and corresponding triangular conorms, such as product t-norm and probabilistic sum t-conorm [62], Einstein t-norm and t-conorm [63], Lukasiewicz t-norm and t-conorm [61], Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm [64], etc., are vehicles to operate on fuzzy sets. Frank operations include the Frank product and Frank sum, which are examples of triangular norms and triangular conorms, respectively.Frank product ⊗Fis a t-norm and Frank sum ⊕Fis a t-conorm. They are defined in the following way:(4)x⊕Fy=1−logλ1+(λ1−x−1)(λ1−y−1)λ−1∀(x,y)∈[0,1]×[0,1](5)x⊗Fy=logλ1+(λx−1)(λy−1)λ−1∀(x,y)∈[0,1]×[0,1]It is pointed out that the Frank product and Frank sum exhibit the following properties [77]:(x⊕Fy)+(x⊗Fy)=x+y(6)∂(x⊕Fy)∂x+∂(x⊗Fy)∂x=1Based on limit theory, we can easily prove some interesting results [77]:(1)If λ→1, then x⊕Fy→x+y−xy, x⊗Fy→xy, the Frank product and Frank sum are reduced to the probabilistic product (product) and probabilistic sum;If λ→∞, then x⊕Fy→min(x+y, 1), x⊗Fy→max(0, x+y−1), the Frank product and Frank sum are reduced to the Lukasiewicz product and Lukasiewicz sum, respectively.In this section, we will introduce Frank operations of hesitant fuzzy set and discuss some desirable properties of these operations.Motivated by the operations on the HFEs, let a t-norm T be the Frank product ⊗Fand t-conorm S be the Frank sum⊕FThen the generalized intersection and union on two HFEs h1 and h2 become the Frank product (denoted by h1⊗Fh2) and Frank sum (denoted by h1⊕Fh2) of two HFEs h1 and h2, respectively.Definition 3Let h, h1, h2 be three HFEs, and k>0, we define their operations as follows:(1)h1⊕Fh2=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)(λ1−γ2−1)λ−1(λ>1);h1⊗Fh2=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2logλ1+(λγ1−1)(λγ2−1)λ−1(λ>1);k⋅Fh=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k(λ−1)k−1(λ>1);h^Fk=∪γ∈hlogλ1+λγ−1kλ−1k−1(λ>1).Based on the operational laws provided in Definition 3, we prove the following Theorem 1.Theorem 1Let h, h1, h2 be three HFEs, and k, k1, k2>0, then we have(1)h1⊕Fh2=h2⊕Fh1;k·F(h1⊕Fh2)=k·Fh1⊕Fk·Fh2;k1·Fh⊕Fk2·Fh=(k1+k2)·Fh;(k1k2)·Fh=k1·F(k2·Fh).It is obvious.h1⊕Fh2=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)(λ1−γ2−1)λ−1, by the Frank operation law (3) in Definition 3, it follows thatk⋅F(h1⊕Fh2)=k⋅F∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)(λ1−γ2−1)λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−(1−logλ(1+((λ1−γ1−1)(λ1−γ2−1))/λ−1))−1)k(λ−1)k−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)k(λ1−γ2−1)k(λ−1)2k−1In addition, sincek⋅Fh1=∪γ1∈h11−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)k(λ−1)k−1andk⋅Fh2=∪γ1∈h11−logλ1+(λ1−γ2−1)k(λ−1)k−1In virtue of the Frank operation law (1) in Definition 3, we havek⋅Fh1⊕Fk⋅Fh2=∪γ1∈h11−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)k(λ−1)k−1⊕F∪γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ2−1)k(λ−1)k−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−(1−logλ(1+((λ1−γ1−1)k)/(λ−1)k−1))−1)(λ1−(1−logλ(1+(((λ1−γ2−1)k)/(λ−1)k−1)))−1)λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)k(λ1−γ2−1)k(λ−1)2k−1Therefore, k·F(h1⊕Fh2)=k·Fh1⊕Fk·Fh2Sincek1⋅Fh=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k1(λ−1)k1−1andk2⋅Fh=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k2(λ−1)k2−1In virtue of the Frank operation law (1) in Definition 3, it follows thatk1⋅Fh⊕Fk2⋅Fh=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k1(λ−1)k1−1⊕F∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k2(λ−1)k2−1=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−(1−logλ(1+(((λ1−γ−1)k1)/(λ−1)k1−1)))−1)(λ1−(1−logλ(1+(((λ1−γ−1)k2)/(λ−1)k2−1)))−1)λ−1=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k1+k2(λ−1)k1+k2−1=(k1+k2)⊕FhSincek2⋅Fh=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k2(λ−1)k2−1and using the Frank operational law (3) in Definition 3, one hask1⋅F(k2⋅Fh)=k1⋅F∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k2(λ−1)k2−1=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+λ1−1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k2(λ−1)k2−1−1k1(λ−1)k1−1=∪γ∈h1−logλ1+(λ1−γ−1)k1k2(λ−1)k1k2−1=(k1k2)⋅Fhwhich completes the proof of Theorem 1.In this section, we introduce some hesitant fuzzy arithmetic aggregation operators with the help of the Frank operations.Definition 4Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFWA: Hn→H, if(7)HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1n(ωj⋅Fhj)=ω1⋅Fh1⊕ω2F⋅Fh2⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhnthen the function HFFWA is called hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted averaging operator (HFFWA), where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n) such that ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1. Especially, if ω=(1/n, 1/n, …, 1/n)T, then the HFFWA operator reduces to the hesitant fuzzy Frank averaging (HFFA) operator of dimension n, which is defined as follows:(8)HFFAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=1n⋅F(h1⊕h2F⊕F…⊕Fhn)Based on the Frank operation laws from Theorem 1, we can derive the following Theorem 2.Theorem 2Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then their aggregated value by HFFWA operator is still a HFE, and(9)HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1n(ωj⋅Fhj)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n) such that ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1.ProofHere, we prove Theorem 2 by using mathematical induction as follows:(1)For n=2, based on the operational laws of HFEs, we haveω1⋅Fh1=∪γ1∈h11−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)ω1(λ−1)ω1−1ω2⋅Fh2=∪γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ2−1)ω2(λ−1)ω2−1Based on Definition 3, we obtainHFFWAω(h1,h2)=ω1⋅Fh1⊕Fω2⋅Fh2=∪γ1∈h11−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)ω1(λ−1)ω1−1⊕F∪γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ2−1)ω2(λ−1)ω2−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−(1−logλ(1+((λ1−γ1−1)ω1/(λ−1)ω1−1)))−1)(λ1−(1−logλ(1+((λ1−γ2−1)ω2/(λ−1)ω2−1)))−1)λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ(1+(1+((λ1−γ1−1)ω1/(λ−1)ω1−1)−1)1+((λ1−γ2−1)ω2/(λ−1)ω2−1)−1λ−1)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)ω1(λ1−γ2−1)ω2(λ−1)ω1+ω2−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h21−logλ1+(λ1−γ1−1)ω1(λ1−γ2−1)ω2If Eq. (9) holds for n=k, i.e.,HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hk)=⊕Fj=1k(ωj⋅Fhj)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk∈hk1−logλ1+∏j=1k(λ1−γj−1)ωjThen if n=k+1, based on the operational laws of the HFEs, we can deduce thatHFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hk,hk+1)=(ω1⋅Fh1⊕Fω2⋅Fh2⊕F…⊕Fωk⋅Fhk)⊕Fωk+1⋅Fhk+1=HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hk)⊕Fωk+1⋅Fhk+1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk∈hk1−logλ1+∏j=1k(λ1−γj−1)ωj⊕F∪γk+1∈hk+11−logλ1+(λ1−γk+1−1)ωk+1(λ−1)ωk+1−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk+1∈hk+11−logλ1+∏j=1k(λ1−γj−1)ωj(λ1−γk+1−1)ωk+1(λ−1)ωk+1−1λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk+1∈hk+11−logλ1+∏j=1k(λ1−γj−1)ωj(λ1−γk+1−1)ωk+1(λ−1)∑j=1kωj−1(λ−1)ωk+1−1(λ−1)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk+1∈hk+11−logλ1+∏j=1k+1(λ1−γj−1)ωj(λ−1)∑j=1k+1ωj−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γk+1∈hk+11−logλ1+∏j=1k+1(λ1−γj−1)ωji.e., Eq. (9) holds for n=k+1. Therefore, Eq. (9) holds for all n, which completes the proof of Theorem 2.Clearly, s(HFFWAω(h1, h1, h1))≠s(h1), thus, HFFWAω(h1, h1, h1)≠h1, which implies the HFFWA operator does not have the property of idempotent.Since s(HFFWAω(h1, h2, h3))>s(h1), HFFWAω(h1, h2, h3)>h1, andh1=maxj=13{hj}, which implies the HFFWA operator does not have the property of bounded.Because s(HFFWAω(h1, h2, h3))>s(HFFWAω(h1, h1, h1)), then we can easily obtain HFFWAω(h1, h2, h3)>HFFWAω(h1, h1, h1), which leads to the contradiction. Therefore, the HFFWA operator does not exhibit the property of monotonicity.In what follows, we investigate some properties of the HFFWA operator.Theorem 3Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFWA operator approaches the following limit(10)limλ→1HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjProofAs λ→1, then∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→0, by logarithmic transform and the rule of equivalent infinitesimal replacement, we havelogλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj=ln1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ→∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ,Based on Taylor's expansion formula, we haveλ1−γj=1+(1−γj)lnλ+(1−γj)2(lnλ)2+⋯Also since λ>1, then lnλ>0, λ1−γj=1+(1−γj)lnλ+O(lnλ), it follows thatλ1−γj−1→(1−γj)lnλTherefore(λ1−γj−1)ωj→((1−γj)lnλ)ωj⇒(λ1−γj−1)ωj→(1−γj)ωj(lnλ)ωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωj∏j=1n(lnλ)ωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωj(lnλ)∑j=1nωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjlnλ⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjThen we havelimλ→1HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−ln1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjwhich completes the proof of Theorem 3.From Theorem 3, we can see that as parameter λ→1, the HFFWA operator reduces to the HFWA operator discussed by Xia and Xu [45].Theorem 4Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFWA operator approaches the following limit(11)limλ→+∞HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjProofAccording to Theorem 2, we havelimλ→+∞HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hnlimλ→+∞1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjBy using logarithmic transform, we havelimλ→+∞1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj=1−limλ→+∞ln1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλBased on the L’Hospital's rule, it follows thatlimλ→+∞1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj=1−limλ→+∞ln1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ=1−limλ→+∞∏j=1nλ1−γj−1ωj/1+∏j=1nλ1−γj−1ωj∑j=1nωj(1−γj)(λ−γj/λ1−γj−1)1/λ=1−limλ→+∞∏j=1nλ1−γj−1ωj1+∏j=1nλ1−γj−1ωj∑j=1nωj(1−γj)λ1−γjλ1−γj−1=1−∑j=1nωj(1−γj)=∑j=1nωjγjwhich completes the proof of Theorem 4.Theorem 5For given arguments hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFWA operator is monotonically decreasing with respect to λ.ProofIn order to verify the HFFWA operator is monotonically decreasing with respect to λ, we should only prove that1−logλ(1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj)is monotonically decreasing with respect to λ.LetF(λ)=1−logλ(1+∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj), taking the derivative of F(λ) with respect to λ, we obtaindF(λ)dλ=−∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)wj∑j=1n(wj(1−γj)/λ−λγ)(1+∏j=1nλ1−γj−1wj)lnλSinceλ>1,0≤γj,wj≤1, we can easily prove thatdF(λ)dλ<0Hence, F(λ) is monotonically decreasing with respect to λ, which implies that HFFWA operator is monotonically decreasing with respect to λ. The proof is completed.Remark 1Theorem 5 shows that the proposed HFFWA operator exhibits monotonic property in the aggregation process, which can be regarded as an index to reflect the decision maker's attitude. In practical decision situations, if the decision maker's attitude is optimistic, then we let λ→1; if the maker's attitude is pessimistic, then we let λ→+∞.Remark 2It is noted that if we use the traditional Frank t-norm (the parameter λ>0) in this proof, we can not produce this theorem, in other words, the proposed aggregation operator may not exhibits monotonicity, so the decision maker can not choose the appropriate parameter value based on his/her attitude in actual need. This is the reason why we take λ>1 instead of λ>0.Based on Theorems 3 and 5, we can easily obtain the following Corollary 1.Corollary 1Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(12)supHFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn1−∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjBased on Theorems 4 and 5, we can easily obtain the following Corollary 2.Corollary 2Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(13)infHFFWAω(h1,h2,⋯,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjFurthermore, based on the HFFWA operator above, we shall develop the hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging (HFFOWA) operator as follows:Definition 5Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFOWA: Hn→H, if(14)HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1n(ωj⋅Fhσ(j))=ω1⋅Fhσ(1)⊕ω2F⋅Fhσ(2)⊕F⋯⊕Fωn⋅Fhσ(n)then the function HFFOWA is called hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging operator, where (σ(1), σ(2), …, σ(n)) is a permutation of (1, 2, …, n) such that hσ(j−1)≥hσ(j) for all j=2, 3, …, n and ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the associated weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1. Especially, if ω=(1/n, 1/n, …, 1/n)T, then the HFFOWA operator is reduced to the HFFAA operator of dimension n.According to the Frank operations with HFEs information, we can derive the Theorem 6 as follows:Theorem 6Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then their aggregated value by HFFOWA operator is still a HFE, and(15)HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1n(ωj⋅Fhσ(j))=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)1−logλ1+∏j=1n(λ1−γσ(j)−1)ωjProposition 1(Commutativity) Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) andhj∗(j=1,2,…,n)be two collection of HFEs. then(16)HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=HFFOWAω(h1*,h2*,…,hn*)wherehj*(j=1,2,…,n)is any permutation of hj(j=1, 2, …, n).ProofIt is obvious and as such is omitted here.However, the HFFOWA operator is neither idempotent, bounded, nor monotonic.Similarly to the discussion on the HFFWA operator, it can be easily proved that the HFFOWA exhibits the following properties.Proposition 2Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFOWA operator approaches the following limit(17)limλ→1HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)1−∏j=1n(1−γσ(j))ωjProposition 3Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFWA operator approaches the following limit:(18)limλ→+∞HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∑j=1nωjγσ(j)Proposition 4For given arguments hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFWA operator is monotonically decreasing with respect to parameter λ.Based on Propositions (2–4), we can easy to prove the following Corollary 3.Corollary 3Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(19)supHFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)1−∏j=1n(1−γσ(j))ωjinfHFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∑j=1nωjγσ(j)Based on the definition of HFFWA and HFFOWA operators, we can see that the HFFWA operator can only reflects the self importance of each HFE, and HFFOWA operator only emphasizes the ordered position importance of each HFE. In real-world practical situations, we should both consider the two aspects at the same time. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we propose the hybrid averaging operator [79] based on Frank t-norm and t-conorm as follows:Definition 6Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFHA: Hn→H, if(20)HFFHAω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1nωj⋅Fhˆσ(j)=ω1⋅Fhˆσ(1)⊕ω2F⋅Fhˆσ(2)⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhˆσ(n)then the function HFFHA is called a hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid averaging operator (HFFHA), where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weighted vector associated with HFFHA such that ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1,w=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n) withwj>0and∑j=1nωj=1.hˆσ(j)is the jth largest of the weighted HFE ofhˆj(hˆj=(nωj)⋅Fhj,j=1, 2, …, n) and n is a certain coefficient delivering a sound trade off.Based on the Frank operations with HFEs information, we can derive the following theorem.Theorem 7Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs. Their aggregated value by HFFHA operator is still a HFE, and(21)HFFHAω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕Fj=1nωjhˆσ(j)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)1−logλ(1+∏j=1n(λ1−γˆσ(j)−1)ωj)ProofSimilar to Theorems 2, we can easily obtain Theorem 7.Corollary 4HFFWA operator is a special case of the HFFHA operator.ProofLetw=1n,1n,…,1nT, thenHFFHAω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=ω1⋅Fhˆσ(1)⊕ω2F⋅Fhˆσ(2)⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhˆσ(n)=1n⋅F(hˆσ(1)⊕hˆσ(2)F⊕F…⊕Fhˆσ(n))=ω1⋅Fh1⊕ω2F⋅Fh2⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhn=HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)which completes the proof of Corollary 4.Corollary 5HFFOWA operator is a special case of the HFFHA operator.ProofLetω=1n,1n,…,1nT, thenHFFHAω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=ω1⋅Fhˆσ(1)⊕ω2F⋅Fhˆσ(2)⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhˆσ(n)=ω1⋅Fhσ(1)⊕ω2F⋅Fhσ(2)⊕F…⊕Fωn⋅Fhσ(n)=HFFOWAw(h1,h2,…,hn)which completes the proof of Corollary 5.Similar to HFFWA operator and the HFFOWA operator, the HFFHA operator also satisfy the following properties. However, which is neither idempotent, bounded, nor monotonic.Proposition 5Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFHA operator approaches the following limit(22)limλ→1HFFHAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)1−∏j=1n(1−γˆσ(j))ωjFrom Proposition 5, we can see that as parameter λ→1, the HFFHA operator reduces to the HFHA operator by Xia and Xu [45].Proposition 6Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFWA operator approaches the following limit(23)limλ→+∞HFFHAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)∑j=1nωjγˆσ(j)Proposition 7For given arguments hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFWA operator is monotonically decreasing with respect to parameter λ.Based on Propositions (5–7), we can easy to prove the following Corollary 6.Corollary 6Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(24)supHFFHAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)1−∏j=1n(1−γˆσ(j))ωjinfHFFHAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)∑j=1nωjγˆσ(j)In this section, we will develop some hesitant fuzzy geometric aggregation operators with the help of the Frank operations.Definition 8Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFWG: Hn→H, if(25)HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hj)^Fωj=(h1)^Fω1⊗(h2)^Fω2F⊗F…⊗F(hn)^Fωnthen the function HFFWG is called the hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted geometric operator, where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight vector of associated with hj(j=1, 2, …, n) such that ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1. Especially, if ω=(1/n, 1/n, …, 1/n)T, then the HFFWG operator is reduced to the hesitant fuzzy Frank geometric (HFFG) operator of dimension n, which is defined in the form:(26)HFFGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=(h1⊗h2F⊗F…⊗Fhn)^F(1/n)Based on the Frank operation laws from Theorem 1, we can derive the following Theorem 9.Theorem 9Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then their aggregated value by HFFWG operator is still a HFE, and(27)HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hj)^Fωj=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hnlogλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weight of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1.ProofHere, we prove the theorem by using the mathematical induction method as follows:(1)For n=2, based on the operational laws of HFEs, we have(h1)^Fω1=∪γ1∈h1logλ1+λγ1−1ω1λ−1ω1−1(h2)^Fω2=∪γ2∈h2logλ1+λγ2−1ω2λ−1ω2−1Based on Definition 3, we obtainHFFWGω(h1,h2)=(h1)^Fω1⊗F(h2)^Fω2=∪γ1∈h1logλ1+(λγ1−1)ω1(λ−1)ω1−1⊗F∪γ2∈h2logλ1+(λγ2−1)ω2(λ−1)ω2−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2logλ1+(λlogλ(1+((λγ1−1)ω1/(λ−1)ω1−1))−1)(λlogλ(1+((λγ2−1)ω2/(λ−1)ω2−1))−1)λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2logλ1+((λγ1−1)ω1/(λ−1)ω1−1)((λγ2−1)ω2/(λ−1)ω2−1)λ−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2logλ1+(λγ1−1)ω1(λγ2−1)ω2(λ−1)ω1+ω2−1=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{logλ(1+(λγ1−1)ω1(λγ2−1)ω2)}=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2logλ1+∏j=12(λγj−1)ωjIf Eq.

(27) holds for n=k+1. Therefore, Eq. (27) holds for all n, which completes the proof of Theorem 9.In the sequel, we investigate some desirable properties of the HFFWG operator.Theorem 10Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFWG operator approaches the following limit(28)limλ→1HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∏j=1nγjωjProofSince λ→1, then∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj→0, by logarithmic transform and the rule of equivalent infinitesimal replacementlogλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj=ln1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλ→∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλBased on Taylor's expansion formula, we haveλγj=1+γjlnλ+γj22(lnλ)2+⋯Also since λ>1, then lnλ>0, λγj=1+γjlnλ+O(lnλ), it follows thatλγj−1→γjlnλTherefore,(λ1−γj−1)ωj→((1−γj)lnλ)ωj⇒(λ1−γj−1)ωj→(1−γj)ωj(lnλ)ωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωj∏j=1n(lnλ)ωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωj(lnλ)∑j=1nωj⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωj→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjlnλ⇒∏j=1n(λ1−γj−1)ωjlnλ→∏j=1n(1−γj)ωjThen we havelimλ→1HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hnlogλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hnlogλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλ=limλ→1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλ=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∏j=1nγjωjwhich completes the proof of Theorem 10.From Theorem 10, we can see that as parameter λ→1, the HFFWG operator reduces to the HFWG operator by Xia and Xu [45].Theorem 11Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFWG operator approaches the following limit(29)limλ→+∞HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjProofAccording to Theorem 9, we havelimλ→∞HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hnlimλ→∞logλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjBy logarithmic transform, we havelimλ→+∞logλ1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj=limλ→+∞ln1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλBased on L’Hospital's rule, it follows thatlimλ→+∞logλ(1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj)=limλ→+∞ln1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωjlnλ=limλ→+∞(∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj/1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj)∑j=1nωjγj(λγj−1/λγj−1)1/λ=limλ→+∞∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj∑j=1nωjγjλγjλγj−1=∑j=1nωjγjwhich completes the proof of Theorem 11.Theorem 12For given HFEs hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFWG operator is monotonically increasing with respect to λ.ProofIn order to verify the HFFWG operator is monotonically increasing with respect to λ, we should only provelogλ(1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj)is monotonically increasing with respect to λ.LetG(λ)=logλ(1+∏j=1n(λγj−1)ωj), taking the derivative G(λ) with respect to λ, and then we havedG(λ)dλ=∏j=1n(λγj−1)wj∑j=1nwjγj/λ−λ1−γj(1+∏j=1nλγj−1wj)lnλSinceλ>1,0≤γj,wj≤1, we can easily obtaindG(λ)dλ>0Thus, G(λ) is an increasing function with respect to λ, which implies that HFFWG operator is an increasing aggregation function with respect to λ. The proof has been completed.Remark 3Theorem 12 shows that the proposed HFFWG operator exhibits monotonic property in the aggregation process, which can be regarded as an index to reflect the decision maker's attitude. In practical decision situations, if the decision maker's attitude is optimistic, then we let λ→+∞; if the maker's attitude is pessimistic, then we let λ→1.Based on Theorems 10 and 12, Corollary 7 ensues.Corollary 7Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(30)infHFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∏j=1nγjωjBased on Theorems 11 and 12, we easily obtain Corollary 8.Corollary 8Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(31)supHFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjFurthermore, based on the HFFWG discussed operator above, we develop the hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (HFFOWG) operator as follows:Definition 8Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFOWG: Hn→H, if(32)HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hσ(j))^Fωj=(hσ(1))^Fω1⊗(hσ(2))^Fω2F⊗F…⊗F(hσ(n))^Fωnthen the function HFFOWG is called hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric averaging operator, where (σ(1), σ(2), …, σ(n)) is a permutation of (1, 2, …, n) such that hσ(j−1)≥hσ(j) for all j=2, 3, …, n and ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the associated weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1. Especially, if ω=(1/n, 1/n, …, 1/n)T, then the HFFOWG operator is reduced to the HFG operator of dimension n.According to the Frank operations with HFEs information, we can derive the Theorem 13 as follows:Theorem 13Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then their aggregated value by HFFOWG operator is still a HFE, and(33)HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hσ(j))^Fωj=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)logλ1+∏j=1n(λγσ(j)−1)ωjProposition 8(Commutativity) Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) andhj∗(j=1,2,…,n)be two collection of HFEs, then(34)HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=HFFOWGω(h1*,h2*,…,hn*)wherehj*(j=1,2,…,n)is any permutation of hj(j=1, 2, …, n).ProofAs it is obvious, it is omitted here.However, the HFFOWG operator is neither idempotent, bounded, nor monotonic.Similar to HFFWG operator, it can be easily shown that the HFFOWG exhibits the following properties:Proposition 9Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFOWG operator approaches the following limit(35)limλ→1HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∏j=1nγσ(j)ωjFrom Proposition 9, we can see that as parameter λ→1, the HFFOWG operator reduces to the HFOWG operator by Xia and Xu [45].Proposition 10Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFOWG operator approaches the following limit(36)limλ→+∞HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∑j=1nωjγσ(j)Proposition 11For given HFEs hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFOWG operator is monotonically increasing with respective to λBased on Propositions (9–11), we can easily obtain the following Corollary 9.Corollary 9Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(37)supHFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∑j=1nωjγσ(j)infHFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γσ(1)∈hσ(1),γσ(2)∈hσ(2),…,γσ(n)∈hσ(n)∏j=1nγσ(j)ωjBased on the definition of HFFWG and HFFOWG operators, we can see that the HFFWG operator can only reflect the self importance of each HFE, and the HFFOWG operator can only emphasizes the ordered position importance of each HFE. In many real-world practice situations, we should both consider the two aspects. This leads us to the hybird geometric operator [79] based on Frank t-norm and t-conorm as follows:Definition 9Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and let HFFHG: Hn→H, if(38)HFFHGω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hˆσ(j))ωj=(hˆσ(1))ω1⊗(hˆσ(2))ω2F⊗F⋯⊗F(hˆσ(n))ωnthen the function HFFHA is called hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid geometric averaging operator (HFFHA), where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the weighted vector associated with HFFHA such that ωj>0 and∑j=1nωj=1,w=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n),wj>0and∑j=1nwj=1.hˆσ(j)is the jth largest of the weighted HFE ofhˆj(hˆj=(hj)^Fnωj,j=1, 2, …, n) and n is the balancing coefficient.Based on the Frank operations with HFEs information, we can derive the Theorem 14 as follows:Theorem 14Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, then their aggregated value by HFFHG operator is still a HFE, and(39)HFFHGω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊗Fj=1n(hˆσ(j))^Fωj=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)logλ(1+∏j=1n(λγˆσ(j)−1)ωj)Corollary 10HFFWG operator is a special case of the HFFHG operator.ProofLetw=1n,1n,…,1nT, thenHFFHGω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=(hˆσ(1))⋅Fω1⊗(hˆσ(2))⋅Fω2F⊗F⋯⊗F(hˆσ(n))⋅Fωn=(hˆσ(1))⋅F(1/n)⊗(hˆσ(2))⋅F(1/n)F⊗F⋯⊗F(hˆσ(n))⋅F(1/n)=(h1)⋅Fω1⊗(h2)⋅Fω2F⊗F⋯⊗F(hn)⋅Fωn=HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)which completes the proof of Corollary 10.Corollary 11HFFOWG operator is a special case of the HFFHG operator.ProofLetω=1n,1n,…,1nT, thenHFFHGω,w(h1,h2,…,hn)=(hˆσ(1))⋅Fω1⊗(hˆσ(2))⋅Fω2F⊗F…⊗F(hˆσ(n))⋅Fωn=(hσ(1))⋅Fω1⊗(hσ(2))⋅Fω2F⊗F…⊗F(hσ(n))⋅Fωn=HFFOWGw(h1,h2,…,hn)which completes the proof of Corollary 11.Similar to HFFWG operator and the HFFOWG operator, the HFFHG operator also satisfy the following propositions. However, which is neither idempotent, bounded, nor monotonic.Proposition 12Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→1, the HFFHG operator approaches the following limit(40)limλ→1HFFHGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)∏j=1nγˆjωjFrom Proposition 12, we can see that as parameter λ→1, the HFFHG operator reduces to the HFHG operator by Xia and Xu [45].Proposition 13Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs and assume that λ>1. As λ→+∞, the HFFHG operator approaches the following limit(41)limλ→+∞HFFHGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γˆσ(1)∈hˆσ(1),γˆσ(2)∈hˆσ(2),…,γˆσ(n)∈hˆσ(n)∑j=1nωjγˆσ(j)Proposition 14For given HFEs hj∈H(j=1, 2, …, n), and λ∈(1, +∞), the HFFHG operator is monotonically increasing with respect to λ.Based on Propositions (12–14), the following result ensues.Corallary 12Let hj(j=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, for any λ∈(1, +∞), then(42)hi(i=1,2,…,n)In what follows, we establish the relationships between the developed arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators based on Frank operations.Theorem 15Let hi(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs, and λ∈(1, +∞), then(43)HFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)≥HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)ProofBased on Corollary 2, we haveinfHFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjThen it follows thatHFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)≥∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjFrom Corollary 8, we havesupHFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjThenHFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)≤∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,…,γn∈hn∑j=1nωjγjTherefore, according to the transfer of inequality, we can easily deduce thatHFFWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)≥HFFWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)The proof has been completed.Theorem 15 shows that the values obtained by the HFFWG operator are no larger than the ones obtained by the HFFWA operator for any λ>1, this implies that the proposed HFFWA operator reflects the decision maker's more optimistic attitude to hesitant fuzzy information than the HFFWG operator in the information fusion process. If λ→1, then attitude of the decision maker is neutral.Theorem 16Let hi(i=1, 2, ⋯, n) be a collection of HFEs, and λ∈(1, +∞), then(44)HFFOWAω(h1,h2,…,hn)≥HFFOWGω(h1,h2,…,hn)ProofThe proof is similar to Theorem 15, and is omitted here.Theorem 16 shows that the values obtained by the HFFOWG operator are not larger than the ones obtained by the HFFOWA operator for any λ>1, which implies that the proposed HFFOWG operator reflects the decision maker's more pessimistic attitude to hesitant fuzzy information than the HFFWG operator in the information fusion process. If λ→1, then attitude of the decision maker is neutral.It is pointed out that the HFFHA and HFFHG operator is not like the operators mentioned above, which not exist strictly order relationship. The main reason leads to this fact is that the different initial transformation of HFEs change the value of aggregation and its order relationship.In this section, we shall utilize the HFFHA (or HFFHG) operator to develop an approach to solve multiple attribute decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information.For a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem, let A={A1, A2, …, Am} be a discrete set of alternatives, and C={C1, C2, …, Cn} be the set of attributes, whose weight vector isω=ω1,ω2,…,ωnT, satisfying ωj≥0 and∑j=1nωj=1. Assume thatH=(hij)m×nis the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix, where the attribute values hij(i=1, 2, …, m, j=1, 2, …, n) are in the form of HFEs.The approach based on HFFHA (or HFFHG) operator to resolve the multiple attribute decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information mainly involves the following steps:Step 1. Transform the decision matrixH=(hij)m×ninto the normalization matrixH¯=(h¯ij)m×nby the method given by Xu and Hu [80].hij¯=hijforbenefitattributecj(hij)cforcostattributecjwhere (hij)cis the complement of hij,such that(hij)c=∪γij∈hij{1−γij}.Step 2. Applying the decision information given in H, and the HFFHA operator(45)hi=HFFHAω,w(hi1,hi2,…,him)i=1,2,…,mOr(46)hi=HFFHGω,w(hi1,hi2,…,him)i=1,2,…,mto derive the overall preference values hi(i=1, 2, …, m) of the alternative Ai, whereω=ω1,ω2,…,ωnTis the weight vector of attributes andw=w1,w2,…,wnTis the weighted vector associated with HFFHA operator such thatwj>0and∑j=1nwj=1.Step 3. Calculate the score values s(hi) (i=1, 2, …, m) of the overall values hi(i=1, 2, …, m).Step 4. Rank all the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, m) and select the best one(s) according to s(hi). The greater the score values s(hi), the better the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, m) will be.Step 5. End.In this section, an illustrative example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method for enterprise personnel selection.Due to the increasing competition of globalization and fast technological improvements, world markets demand companies to deliver high quality products and services. This can only be achieved by employing adequate personnel. Personnel selection is the process of choosing individuals who match the qualifications required to perform a defined job in the best possible way. It determines the input quality of personnel and plays a decisive role in human resource management. Increasing competition in global markets urges organizations to put more emphasis on personnel selection process. Important issues such as changes in organizations, work, society, regulations, and marketing have an inﬂuence on personnel selection and recruiting. Some enterprises make a strategic decision to choose the best candidate by utilizing rigorous and costly selection procedures. Because many individual attributes considered for personnel selection exhibit vagueness and imprecision, therefore, the hesitant fuzzy set theory seems to be a suitable tool to provide a framework that incorporates uncertain judgments inherent in the personnel selection process.Let us consider a manufacturing company, which intends to recruit a sales manager for its vacant position (adopted from [81]). After pre-elimination, six candidates Ai(i=1, 2, …, 6) have been designated for further evaluation. One has to make a decision according to the following four attributes: (1) C1 is the oral communication skill; (2) C2 is the past experience; (3) C3 is the general aptitude; (4) C4 is the self-confidence. The attribute weight is given by decision maker as ω=(0.35, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15)T. The six candidates Ai(i=1, 2, …, 6) are to be evaluated in anonymity with hesitant fuzzy information by the decision maker under the above four attributes Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4), as listed in Table 1.Here we utilize the developed method based on HFFHA operator to obtain the ranking order of the alternatives and select the most desirable one(s). The method involves the following steps:Step 1. Consider all the attribute Cj(j=1, 2, 3, 4) are the benefit attribute, thus, the attribute values of the alternatives Ai(j=1, 2, …, 6) do not require normalization.Step 2. Utilizing the decision information presented in Table 1, andhˆij=(nωj)⋅Fhij, (suppose n=3, λ=2), the results are determined as follows:hˆ11={0.2092,0.4161},hˆ12={0.1530,0.4891,0.6903},hˆ13={0.2323,0.4891,0.5849},hˆ14={0.1990,0.2579}hˆ21={0.4161,0.7193,0.9120},hˆ22={0.1530,0.3142},hˆ23={0.3142,0.4891,0.8127},hˆ24={0.2579,0.3233}hˆ31={0.3130,0.5183},hˆ32={0.5849,0.6903},hˆ33={0.2323,0.3994,0.5849},hˆ34={0.0940,0.2579,0.3985}hˆ41={0.4161,0.5183,0.6195},hˆ42={0.0757,0.2323}hˆ43={0.1530,0.3142,0.8127},hˆ44={0.0940,0.1447}hˆ51={0.4161,0.7193},hˆ52={0.1530,0.2323}hˆ53={0.4891,0.5849,0.6903},hˆ54={0.1447,0.1990,0.4899}hˆ61={0.7193,0.8171,0.9120},hˆ62={0.3142,0.3994,0.5849}hˆ63={0.3994,0.4891},hˆ64={0.3985,0.4899}By using the score function of HFE, we obtain:s(hˆ11)=0.3076,s(hˆ12)=0.4441,s(hˆ13)=0.4354,s(hˆ14)=0.2035s(hˆ21)=0.6825,s(hˆ22)=0.2336,s(hˆ23)=0.5387,s(hˆ24)=0.2906s(hˆ31)=0.4156,s(hˆ32)=0.6376,s(hˆ33)=0.4055,s(hˆ34)=0.2501s(hˆ41)=0.5180,s(hˆ42)=0.1540,s(hˆ43)=0.4266,s(hˆ44)=0.1194s(hˆ51)=0.5677,s(hˆ52)=0.1926,s(hˆ53)=0.5881,s(hˆ54)=0.2779s(hˆ61)=0.8161,s(hˆ62)=0.4328,s(hˆ63)=0.4442,s(hˆ64)=0.4441Thenhˆσ(11)=hˆ12={0.1530,0.4891,0.6903},hˆσ(12)=hˆ13={0.2323,0.4891,0.5849}hˆσ(13)=hˆ11={0.2092,0.4161},hˆσ(14)=hˆ14={0.1990,0.2579}hˆσ(21)=hˆ21={0.4161,0.7193,0.9120},hˆσ(22)=hˆ23={0.3142,0.4891,0.8127}hˆσ(23)=hˆ24={0.2579,0.3233},hˆσ(24)=hˆ22={0.1530,0.3142}hˆσ(31)=hˆ32={0.5849,0.6903},hˆσ(32)=hˆ31={0.3130,0.5183}hˆσ(33)=hˆ33={0.2323,0.3994,0.5849},hˆσ(34)=hˆ34={0.0940,0.2579,0.3985}hˆσ(41)=hˆ41={0.4161,0.5183,0.6195},hˆσ(42)=hˆ43={0.1530,0.3142,0.8127},hˆσ(43)=hˆ42={0.0757,0.2323},hˆσ(44)=hˆ44={0.0940,0.1447}hˆσ(51)=hˆ53={0.4891,0.5849,0.6903},hˆσ(52)=hˆ51={0.4161,0.7193}hˆσ(53)=hˆ54={0.1447,0.1990,0.4899},hˆσ(54)=hˆ52={0.1530,0.2323}hˆσ(61)=hˆ61={0.7193,0.8171,0.9120},hˆσ(62)=hˆ63={0.3994,0.4891},hˆσ(63)=hˆ64={0.3985,0.4899},hˆσ(64)=hˆ62={0.3142,0.3994,0.5849}Step 3. Utilize the HFFHA operator which has associated weight vectorw=(0.3,0.3,0.2,0.2)Ttoobtain the overall preference values hiof the alternative Ai(i=1, 2, …, 6). Due to the space limitation, alternative A1 is provided as a representative example.h1=HFFHAω,w(h11,h12,h13,h14)=∪γˆσ11∈hˆσ(11),γˆσ(12)∈hˆσ(12),…,γˆσ(1n)∈hˆσ(1n)1−logλ(1+∏j=14(λ1−γˆσ(1j)−1)ωj)=0.1977,0.2098,0.2435,0.2551,0.2865,0.2976,0.3284,0.3389,0.3266,0.3371,0.3666,0.3766,0.3079,0.3187,0.3488,0.3591,0.3870,0.3968,0.4241,0.4334,0.4225,0.4319,0.4578,0.4667,0.3976,0.4072,0.4341,0.4433,0.4682,0.4769,0.5012,0.5095,0.4998,0.5081,0.5311,0.5395}Step 4. Calculate the score values s(hi)(i=1, 2, …, 6) of the overall hesitant fuzzy preference values hi(i=1, 2, …, 6).s(h1)=0.3899,s(h2)=0.5322,s(h3)=0.4782s(h4)=0.3759,s(h5)=0.4708,s(h6)=0.6031Step 5. Rank all the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, 6) according to the score values s(hi)(i=1, 2, …, 6) of the overall hesitant fuzzy preference values hi(i=1, 2, …, 6). The ranking order of alternative is: A6≻A2≻A3≻A5≻A1≻A4, where the symbol ''≻'' means “superior to”. Thus, the most desirable person is A6.Based on the HFFHG operator, in order to select the most desirable person, we can develop a method for handling multiple attribute decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information, which can be described as follows:Step 1′. The same as the above Step 1.Step 2′.

Utilize the HFFHG operator which has associated weight vectorw=(0.3,0.3,0.2,0.2)Tto obtain the overall preference values hiof the alternative Ai(i=1, 2, ⋯, 6). Due to the space limitation, alternative A1 is provided as a representative example.h1=HFFHAω,w(h11,h12,h13,h14)=∪γˆσ11∈hˆσ(11),γˆσ(12)∈hˆσ(12),…,γˆσ(1n)∈hˆσ(1n)1−logλ(1+∏j=14(λ1−γˆσ(1j)−1)ωj)=0.1977,0.2098,0.2435,0.2551,0.2865,0.2976,0.3284,0.3389,0.3266,0.3371,0.3666,0.3766,0.3079,0.3187,0.3488,0.3591,0.3870,0.3968,0.4241,0.4334,0.4225,0.4319,0.4578,0.4667,0.3976,0.4072,0.4341,0.4433,0.4682,0.4769,0.5012,0.5095,0.4998,0.5081,0.5311,0.5395}Step 4′. Calculate the score values s(hi)(i=1, 2, …, 6) of the overall hesitant preference values hi(i=1, 2, …, 6).s(h1)=0.5419,s(h2)=0.6335,s(h3)=0.6232s(h4)=0.4712,s(h5)=0.6029,s(h6)=0.7475Step 5′. Rank all the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, 6) according to score values s(hi)(i=1, 2, …, 6) of the overall hesitant fuzzy preference values hi(i=1, 2, …, 6). The ranking order is: A6≻A2≻A3≻A5≻A1≻A4, where the symbol ''≻'' means “superior to”. Thus, the most desirable person is A6.It is clear to see that they are the same ranking results for two methods based on HFFHA operator and the HFFHG operator, respectively, and also the same as the result in [47].In order to reflect the influence with the different value of parameter λ, we use different parameter λ in our proposed methods to rank the alternatives. The ranking results are shown in Table 2and Figs. 1 and 2.As we can see from Table 2, the aggregation score values with different parameter λ are different, but the ranking orders of the alternatives are the same in this example, which means the proposed methods have the property of isotonicity, the DMs can choose the appropriate value in accordance with their preferences. By further analyzing Figs. 1 and 2, we can find that the score values obtained by HFFHA operator become smaller as the parameter λ increases for the same alternative, but the score values obtained by HFFHG operator become greater as the parameter λ increases for the same alternative. In general, we can take the value of λ=2 in the process of computation, there are two main advantages to do so: (1) simplified calculation; (2) when λ=2, they are approximate to the result by using HFHA (HFHG) operator with probabilistic t-norms and probabilistic t-conorms.In what follows, we compare our proposed methods with other previous methods including hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted averaging (HFFHA) operator (or HFFHG operator) [45], hesitant fuzzy Einstein hybrid weighted averaging (HFEHA) operator (or HFEHG operator) [57], and hesitant fuzzy Hamacher hybrid weighted averaging (HFHHA) operator (or HFHHG operator) [86]. The results are shown in Table 3.(1)Compared with HFFHA operator (or HFFHG operator) proposed by Xu and Xia [45], the HFFHA operator (or HFFHG operator) is only a special case of our proposed operators when parameter λ→1. So, our methods are more general. Furthermore, the proposed operators based on Frank t-norms, are more robust and can capture the relationship between the arguments. Moreover, when λ→∞, the proposed operators are reduced to the operators based on Lukasiewicz product and Lukasiewicz sum. Therefore, the hesitant fuzzy Frank aggregation operators can contain almost all of the arithmetic aggregation operators and geometric aggregation operators for HFEs according to different values of parameter λ.Compared with HFEHA operator (or HFEHG operator) proposed by Yu [57], the computational complexity of our methods are simple than HFEHA (or HFEHG) operator. Then, the proposed methods include a parameter, which can adjust the aggregate value based on the real decision needs, and capture many existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Therefore, the benefit is that the proposed operators come with their higher generality and flexibility.Compared with HFHHA operator proposed by Zhou et al. [86], the main advantage of our proposed method is that the HFFHA operator has a desirable property that monotonically decreasing with respect to the parameter λ, which provides the decision makers to choose the appropriate value in accordance with their risk preferences. If the decision maker is risk preference, we can take the parameter as large as possible, if the decision maker is risk aversion, we can take the parameter as small as possible. So, the decision maker can use the appropriate parameter value based on their risk preference and actual needs.According to the comparisons and analysis completed above, the approach introduced in this study is better than the other three methods based on algebraic operation, Einstein operation and Hamacher operation, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the process of multiple attribute decision making, due to the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the real-life decision making problems, the attribute value is more suitable expressed as hesitant fuzzy number. Although many information fusion methods have been proposed to aggregate hesitant fuzzy information, all these existing methods are limited to probability or Einstein t-norm and t-conorm, and they are lack of flexible in the process of aggregation. In this paper, motivated by the idea of Frank t-norm and t-conorm, we establish the Frank operations of hesitant fuzzy set, some new hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators, such as HFFWA, HFFOWA, HFFHA, HFFWG, HFFOWG, HFFHG operators, are proposed for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information respectively. Some desirable properties of these aggregation operators and its special cases also been discussed in detail. Then, we have developed some approaches based on HFFHA and HFFHG operator for handling multiple attribute decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. Finally, a practical example with human resource selection is given to illustrates the procedure and verify the validity and effectiveness of our proposed methods.In the future research, we will extend these aggregation operators for handling interval-valued hesitant fuzzy MADM problems, and we will apply them to artificial intelligence [82], data mining [83], computing with words [84], and project management [85]. Furthermore, it could be beneficial develop some consensus model for the hesitant fuzzy MADM problems based on Frank triangular norms, and extend these results to real-world management applications. Another interesting direction is to develop some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators with the aid of granular computing, because how to select the optimal parameter of Frank aggregation is an important problem, the optimal allocation information granularity will be a helpful technique for this key problem. Meanwhile, the sensitivity and robustness analysis of the proposed operators are also two core issues for MADM with hesitant fuzzy information. Moreover, another route to define operators on hesitant type fuzzy sets is by applying Zadeh's extension principle. This has been done for type-2 fuzzy sets [87,90], for intuitionistic fuzzy sets using their equivalence with interval valued fuzzy sets [88], to define the type-1 OWA operator, linguistic majorities [89], etc. because the hesitant fuzzy sets can be regarded as a type of discretised type-2 fuzzy sets, therefore, we can use the result of type-2 fuzzy extension principle to define some new hesitant fuzzy operations and develop some new aggregation operators based on a variety of triangular norms. These problems will be considered in the future study.
