@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper develops a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which introduces the risk attitude of decision makers (DMs) in the aggregation process. First, under the general framework of utility function, we provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and study its properties which are suitable for any utility function. Then, under the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, we propose another new operator named as the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and further investigate its families including a wide range of aggregation operators. To determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. Considering that different DMs may have different opinions toward decision-making and their opinions can be characterized by different orness measures, we construct a new optimization model to determine the optimal weights which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a method for the multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) is developed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the GOWUA-HARA operator to the MAGDM.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) considers the problem of evaluating or selecting alternatives that are associated with incommensurate and conflicting criteria by a cooperative group, known as the group decision-making (Vahdani et al., 2013). To choose a desirable alternative, decision makers (DMs) often present their preference information which needs to be aggregated via some proper approaches. There are many methods for aggregating information (Canós & Liern, 2008; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Herrera, & Alonso, 2007; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Fullér & Majlender, 2003a, 2003b; Liu, 2013; Llamazares, 2004; Maes, Saminger, & De Baets, 2007; Merigó, 2008; Merigó & Casanovas, 2010a, 2010b; Merigó, Casanovas, & Yang, 2014; Merigó, Casanovas, & Zeng, 2014; Merigó & Gil-Lafuente, 2010, 2011, 2013; Merigó & Yager, 2013; Mesiar, 2007; Ribeiro & Pereira, 2003; Xu, 2004, 2006a, 2006b; Xu, Yang, & Wang, 2006; Yager, 1988, 2004, 2010; Yager & Filev, 1994, 1999; Yang, 2001; Yang, Yang, Liu, & Li, 2013; Zeng, Merigó, & Su, 2013; Zhang, 2013; Zhou & Chen, 2014). One of the most popular methods for aggregating decision-making information is the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator developed by Yager (1988). It provides a general class of parametric aggregation operators and has shown to be useful for studying many different kinds of aggregation problems. Up to now, the OWA operator has been used in a wide range of applications (Merigó & Gil-Lafuente, 2010, 2011; Yager, 2010).Motivated by the OWA operator, an extension of the OWA operator is the generalized OWA (GOWA) operator, which combines the OWA operator with the generalized mean operator (Yager, 2004). It generalizes a wide range of aggregation operators such as the OWA operator, the ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator (Xu & Da, 2002a), the ordered weighted harmonic averaging (OWHA) operator (Yager, 2004). Based on the optimization theory, Zhou and Chen (2010) presented the generalized ordered weighted logarithm averaging (GOWLA) operator, which is an extension of the OWGA operator. Other extension of the OWA operator can be found in literature (Merigó, 2008; Yager & Filev, 1999). However, the above aggregation operators only focus on using the mean to eliminate the difference, and do not consider the DMs’ risk attitude in the aggregation process.Another important issue of applying the OWA operator for MAGDM is how to determine the associated weights. Many researchers have focused on this issue and developed some useful approaches to obtaining the OWA weights. For example, O'Hagan (1988) suggested a maximum entropy approach to obtaining OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Yager (1993) suggested an interesting way to compute the weights of the OWA operator using linguistic quantifiers. Fullér and Majlender (2003a) proposed an analytic approach for obtaining maximal entropy OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Wang and Parkan (2005) proposed a minimax disparity approach for obtaining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Majlender (2005) developed a maximal Rényi entropy method for generating a parametric class of the OWA operators and the maximal Rényi entropy OWA weights. Wang, Luo, and Liu (2007) constructed the chi-square (χ2) model for determining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure. Other extension approaches to determining the OWA operator weights can be found in literature (Ahn, 2010; Amin & Emrouznejad, 2010; Filev & Yager, 1998; Merigó, 2008; Sang & Liu, 2014; Xu, 2006a, 2006b; Xu & DA, 2002b, 2003; Yager, 1988, 2009a, 2009b). The methods mentioned above assume that any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal aggregated weighting vector, and correspondingly there is only one orness measure to characterize the DMs’ attitude toward decision-making. As a result, there is only one set of the OWA operator weights to be generated. However, this is not consistent with the real situation. In fact, multiple DMs may join in decision-making process to reach a holistic opinion that reflects a collective view of all the participants. In the decision-making process, different DMs may have different orness measures, and therefore the corresponding OWA operator weights may also be different. So it is necessary to introduce a new method to aggregate all the participants’ preference in MAGDM.This paper aims to develop a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which incorporates the risk attitude of DMs in the aggregation process. Under the general framework of utility function and based on an optimal deviation model, we firstly provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and then by studying its properties we find that it is commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent. These properties are suitable for any utility function. Furthermore, we focus on the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, which is rather rich, e.g., by suitable adjustments of the parameters, power utility function and exponential utility function can be obtained respectively. Under the HARA utility, we propose another new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and study its families which contain a wide range of aggregation operators such as the OWGA operator, OWA operator, OWHA operator, GOWA operator, maximum operator, minimum operator. The main advantage of the GOWUA-HARA operator is that it cannot only reflect the DMs’ risk attitude toward the aggregation information, but also provide a very general formulation including a wide range of aggregation operators.In order to determine the weights of the GOWUA-HARA operator, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator, which is an extension of the orness measure of the GOWA operator presented by Yager (2004). We further investigate some properties associated with this orness measure. Noting that different DMs may have different perspectives toward decision-making, which can be characterized by different orness measures, this situation leads to different sets of the GOWUA-HARA operator weights corresponding to different orness measures. We then construct a new nonlinear optimization model to determine the optimal weighting vector of the GOWUA-HARA operator which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. The main advantage of the nonlinear model is that it cannot only minimize the differences between the orness measures provided by each DM and the comprehensive orness measure corresponding to an optimal weighting vector, but also produce as equally important weights as possible.Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a new approach for MAGDM is developed. This approach is also effectively applicable to different group decision-making problems such as engineering management and financial management. In the end, we provide an application of the new approach for MAGDM in an example of the investment selection.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the OWA, OWGA and GOWA operators and introduces an HARA utility function. Section 3 presents a GOWUA operator and analyzes its properties. Especially, we provide a GOWUA-HARA operator and identify its families. Section 4 proposes an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and discusses its properties. In particular, we further construct a nonlinear model for determining the optimal weights which can aggregate each DM's opinion. Section 5 develops an approach for MAGDM under the GOWUA-HARA operator. An illustrative example is provided in Section 6 and the conclusions are drawn in Section 7.This section briefly reviews the OWA, OWGA and GOWA operators and introduces an HARA utility function which later will be used to develop a new aggregation operator in this paper.The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator was presented by Yager (1988), which can be defined as follows:Definition 1(Yager, 1988). A mapping OWA: Rn→ R is called an ordered weighted aggregation (OWA) operator of dimension n if(1)OWA(x1,x2,…,xn)=∑i=1nwiyi,where wiis a weight satisfying wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1, yiis the ith largest of the xj.Xu and Da (2002a) provided the ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator, which can be defined as follows:Definition 2(Xu & Da, 2002a). An ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator is a mapping OWGA: R+n→ R+ that has a weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T with wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1, such that(2)OWGA(x1,x2,…,xn)=∏i=1nyiwi,where yiis the ith largest of the xj.Yager (2004) developed the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator, which is defined as follows:Definition 3(Yager, 2004). A generalized ordered weighted aggregation (GOWA) operator of dimension n is a mapping GOWA: R+n→ R+ that has a weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T with wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1, such that(3)GOWA(x1,x2,…,xn)=(∑i=1nwiyiλ)1/λ,where yiis the ith largest of xj, and λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞).By taking different values of the parameter λ in the GOWA operator, a group of particular cases can be derived. For example, the GOWA operator reduces to the OWA operator when λ = 1; the GOWA operator degenerates to the OWGA operator when λ → 0; the GOWA operator reduces to the OWHA operator as λ = −1.In general, the basic feature of all aggregation operators is the non-decreasing monotonicity, expressing the idea that “an increase of any of the input values cannot decrease the output value”. The desirable properties of each aggregation operator are commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent (Xu & Da, 2002a). Each aggregation operator mentioned above satisfies these properties. However, these operators cannot reflect the risk attitude of the DMs in the aggregation process. Therefore, when aggregating the input arguments, we can introduce the utility function which not only satisfies the basic feature and desirable properties of aggregation operators, but also can reflect the risk attitude of the DMs toward the input argument information.Generally, utility function u(x) is a non-decreasing real valued function, which just captures the idea of aggregation operator that “an increase of any of the input values cannot decrease the output value”. We investigate the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function (Grasselli, 2003; Jung & Kim, 2012), which is defined as:(4)u(x)=1−γβγ(β1−γx+η)γ,where β > 0, η > 0, γ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, 1) (for more discussions on the parameters, cf., Cox & Huang, 1989; Merton, 1971). The HARA utility is rather rich, since by suitable adjustments of the parameters one can obtain utility functions with absolute or relative risk aversion. In particular,(1)if β = 1 − γ and η → 0 in Eq. (4), then we obtain the power utility function:(5)u(x)=xγγ,γ∈(−∞,0)∪(0,1),if η = 1 and compute the limit as γ → −∞ in Eq. (4), we obtain the exponential utility function:(6)u(x)=−e−βxβ,β>0.Pratt (1964) and Arrow (1965) suggested the risk aversion coefficient r(x) = − u''(x)/u'(x) which is called the Pratt–Arrow measure of absolute risk aversion. The absolute risk aversion coefficient of HARA utility is r(x, γ, β, η) = β(1 − γ)/(βx + η(1 − γ)), which implies that with the relative risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increasing, the risk attitude of DM's involved in the evaluation of decision information will become more prudent.In this section, we firstly present a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator for the general utility function. Then, under the HARA utility function, we propose another new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator and identify its families.Let xi(i = 1, 2, …, n) be a collection of arguments, and W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T be a weighting vector such that wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1. We assume that the utility aggregation operator of dimension n is a mapping f determined by:(7)u(z)=f(u(x1),u(x2),…,u(xn)).In the aggregation process, we hope that the smaller the deviation between the utility values u(xi) (i = 1, 2, …, n) and the aggregation result u(z) is, the better effect of aggregation method shows. Hence, to minimize the deviation between u(z) and u(xi) (i = 1, 2, …, n), we have(8)minP=∑i=1nwi(uλ(z)−uλ(xi))2,where λ is a parameter satisfying λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞). By taking the first partial derivative w.r.t. z in the model (8), we obtain∂P∂z=2∑i=1nwi(uλ(z)−uλ(xi))×λuλ−1(z)×u′(z)According to the necessary condition of extreme value, let ∂P/∂z = 0, we obtain(9)z=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(xi))1/λ].Based on Eq. (9), we can define a generalized weighted utility averaging (GWUA) operator shown as follows:Definition 4A GWUA operator of dimension n is a mapping GWUA: R+n→ R+ such that(10)GWUA(x1,x2,…,xn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(xi))1/λ],where the weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T satisfies wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1, and λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞).If reordering the arguments in the GWUA operator in descending order, we can obtain a generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator.A GOWUA operator of dimension n is a mapping GOWUA: R+n→ R+ such that(11)GOWUA(x1,x2,…,xn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ],where λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞), and yiis the ith largest of xjand the weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T such that wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1.The following properties show that the GOWUA operator is idempotent, monotonic, bounded and commutative, which are suitable for any utility function.(Idempotency). Let f be the GOWUA operator. If xi= x for i = 1, 2, …, n, then(12)f(x1,x2,…,xn)=x.If xi= x for i = 1, 2, …, n, then according to Eq. (11), we obtain thatf(x1,x2,…,xn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(x))1/λ]=x.The property is proved. □(Monotonicity). Let f be the GOWUA operator. If xi≥ tifor i = 1, 2, …, n, then(13)f(x1,x2,…,xn)≥f(t1,t2,…,tn).Letf(x1,x2,…,xn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ].According to the above equation, taking the first partial derivative of f w.r.t. yi, we have that∂f∂yi=[(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ−1/u′(u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ])]×∑i=1nwiuλ−1(yi)×u′(yi).Since u(yi) > 0 and u'(yi) > 0, we obtain that ∂f/∂yi> 0, which implies that f monotonically increases w.r.t. yi. Note that xi≥ tifor i = 1, 2, …, n, therefore, we getf(x1,x2,…,xn)≥f(t1,t2,…,tn).The property is proved.  □(Boundedness). Let f be the GOWUA operator. If y1 = max1 ≤ i ≤ n{xi} andyn=min1≤i≤n{xi}, then(14)yn≤f(x1,x2,…,xn)≤y1.If y1 = max1 ≤ i ≤ n{xi}, then by Property 2, we have thatf(x1,x2,…,xn)≤f(y1,y1,…,y1)=u−1[(∑i=1nwi(u(y1))λ)1/λ]=y1.By the same token, we can conclude that f(x1, x2, …, xn) ≥ yn. Thus,yn≤f(x1,x2,…,xn)≤y1.The property is proved.  □(Commutativity). Let f be the GOWUA operator. If viis any permutation of the arguments xifor i = 1, 2, …, n, then(15)f(x1,x2,…,xn)=f(v1,v2,…,vn).Letf(x1,x2,…,xn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwi(u(yi))λ)1/λ]andf(v1,v2,…,vn)=u−1[(∑i=1nwi(u(ti))λ)1/λ].Since (v1, v2, …, vn) is any permutation of the arguments (x1, x2, …, xn), we can get yi= tifor all i. So, we obtain thatf(x1,x2,…,xn)=f(v1,v2,…,vn).The property is proved.  □(Monotonicity with respect to parameter λ). Let F be the GOWUA operator. If λ1 ≥ λ2, we have(16)F(λ1)≥F(λ2).LetF(λ)=u−1[(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ].According to the above equation, letf(λ)=(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ. Taking the first derivative of f w.r.t. λ, we have thatf′(λ)=1λ2(∑i=1nwiuλ(yi))1/λ−1×[∑i=1nwiuλ(yi)loguλ(yi)−∑i=1nwiuλ(yi)log∑i=1nwiuλ(yi)].Letti=uλ(yi),t0=∑i=1nwiuλ(yi)and h(t) = t log t, we havef′(λ)=λ−2(f(λ))1−λ[∑i=1nwih(ti)−h(t0)]. For t > 0, we have h''(t) = 1/t > 0, which means that the function h(t) is strictly convex such that h(ti) > h(t0) + (ti− t0)h'(t0) for all t0 > 0, ti≥ 0 and ti≠ t0. Hence, we have∑i=1nwih(ti)≥∑i=1nwih(t0)+∑i=1nwi(ti−t0)h′(t0)=h(t0),where the equality holds only if ti= t0 for all i with wi> 0. Excluding this case, the first derivative f'(λ) > 0 implies that f monotonically increases w. r. t. λ. Note that dF/dλ = f'(λ)/u'[u−1(f(λ))], we have dF/dλ ≥ 0, meaning that F monotonically increases w. r. t. λ. That is,F(λ1)≥F(λ2).The property is proved.  □According to Eqs. (4), (10) and the reverse function of HARA utility(17)u−1(x)=1−γβ[(βγ1−γx)1/γ−η],we haveGWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ×[(βγ1−γ(∑i=1nwi(1−γβγ(β1−γxi+η)γ)λ)1/λ)1/γ−η]=1−γβ[((∑i=1nwi((β1−γxi+η)γ)λ)1/λ)1/γ−η]=1−γβ[(∑i=1nwi(β1−γxi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η].Thus, we can obtain(18)GWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ[(∑i=1nwi(β1−γxi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],which is called the GWUA-HARA operator.If reordering the arguments of the GWUA-HARA operator in descending order, we can define a generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator.Definition 6A generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator of dimension n is a mapping GOWUA-HARA: R+n→ R+ such that(19)GOWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ[(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],where yiis the ith largest of xjand the weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)T satisfies wi∈ [0, 1] and∑i=1nwi=1.From Eq. (19), we find that the GOWUA-HARA operator may focus on its structure and importance of arguments rather than the weighting pattern, which leads to the fact that the GOWUA-HARA operator with more effectively theoretic basis is superior to other aggregation operators including the OWA operator, the OWGA operator, the OWHA operator, etc.Note that HARA is a utility function, then according to Property 1 to Property 5, we can conclude that the GOWUA-HARA operator is commutative, monotonic, bounded and idempotent.The following theorems and corollaries show that by taking different values of λ, β, η, γ in the GOWUA-HARA operator, we can obtain different types of aggregation operators including the OWGA operator, OWA operator, OWHA operator, GOWA operator, maximum operator, minimum operator, OWUGA-HARA operator, OWUA-HARA operator, OWUHA-HARA operator, etc.Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If β = 1 − γ, η → 0, γ → 1 and λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞), then(20)limγ→1(limη→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=(∑i=1nwiyiλ)1/λ.If β = 1 − γ, η → 0, γ → 1 and λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞), we get thatlimγ→1(limη→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=limγ→1[limη→0((∑i=1nwi(yi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η)]=limγ→1(∑i=1nwi(yi)λγ)1/λγ=(∑i=1nwiyiλ)1/λ.The theorem is proved. □Theorem 1 is just the GOWA operator (Yager, 2004), meaning that GOWUA-HARA is an extension of the GOWA operator.Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If λ → 0, then(21)limλ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ(∏i=1n(β1−γyi+η)wi−η),which is called as the ordered weighted utility geometric averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (OWUGA-HARA) operator.By the L'Hôpital's rule, we have thatlimλ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=limλ→01−γβ[(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η].Sincelimλ→0(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ=limλ→0exp(1λγlog(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ))=exp(∑i=1nwilog(β1−γyi+η))=∏i=1n(β1−γyi+η)wi.So,limλ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ(∏i=1n(β1−γyi+η)wi−η).The theorem is proved. □According to Eq. (21), it is easy to derive the following conclusions.Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If λ → 0, β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, 1), then the GOWUA-HARA operator is an extension of the OWGA operator (Xu & Da, 2002a).(22)limη→0(limλ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=∏i=1nyiwi,Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If λ = 1, then(23)f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ((∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)γ)1/γ−η),which is named as the ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (OWUA-HARA) operator.According to Eq. (19), it is easy to derive the conclusion.  □When λ = 1, by choosing different values of β, γ, η, we can obtain the following different aggregation operators:(1)Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ → 1, then the GOWUA-HARA will degenerate to the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator (Yager, 1988):(24)limγ→1(limη→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=∑i=1nwiyi.Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If γ → 0, β > 0 and η > 0, then(25)limγ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1β(∏i=1n(βyi+η)wi−η),which is called the constant coefficient OWGA (CC-OWGA) operator.Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If β = 1, η → 0 and γ → 0, then the GOWUA-HARA will reduce to the OWGA operator (Xu & Da, 2002a):(26)limη→0(limγ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=∏i=1n(yi)wi.(1) If β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ → 1, according to Eq. (23), it is easy to get the conclusion.(2) If γ → 0, β > 0 and η > 0, according to Eq. (23), we havelimγ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=limγ→01−γβ((∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)γ)1/γ−η).Since,limγ→0(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)γ)1/γ=limγ→0exp(1γlog(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)γ))=exp(∑i=1nwilog(βyi+η))=∏i=1n(βyi+η)wi.Then,limγ→0f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1β(∏i=1n(βyi+η)wi−η).(3) According to Eq. (23) and Eq. (25), it is easy to derive the conclusion.This completes the proof. □Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If λ = −1, then(27)f(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ(1/(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)γ)1/γ−η),which is named as the ordered weighted utility harmonic averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (OWUHA-HARA) operator.According to Eq. (19), it is easy to get the conclusion.  □Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. If λ = −1, β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ → 1, then(28)limγ→1(limη→0f(x1,x2,…,xn))=1/(∑i=1nwiyi),which is just the ordered weighted harmonic averaging (OWHA) operator (Yager, 2004).Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. When λ → +∞, by choosing different values of γ, we have the following statements.(1)If 0 < γ < 1, then f(x1, x2, …, xn) = y1 (i.e., maximum operator).If γ < 0, then f(x1, x2, …, xn) = yn(i.e., minimum operator).According to Property 1 and Property 2, we derive thatf(x1,x2,…,xn)≤f(y1,y1,…,y1)=y1,where y1 = max1 ≤ i ≤ n{xi}. When λ → +∞, by choosing 0 < γ < 1 and γ < 0, we will obtain the opposite results in the following two cases:(1)If 0 < γ < 1 and λ → +∞, then(∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ≥(w1(β1−γy1+η)λγ)1/λγ=w11/λγ(β1−γy1+η).That is,(29)1−γβ((∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η)≥1−γβ(w11/λγ(β1−γy1+η)−η).Taking the limitation on both sides in inequality (29), we getlimλ→+∞1−γβ((∑i=1nwi(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η)≥limλ→+∞1−γβ(w11/λγ(β1−γy1+η)−η)=y1.Therefore,limλ→+∞f(x1,x2,…,xn)=y1,which is just the maximum operator.If γ < 0 and λ → +∞, we have that λγ → −∞. Just as the above proof, we can get the minimum operator.The theorem is proved. □Let f be the GOWUA-HARA operator. When λ → −∞, by choosing different values of γ, we have the following statements.(1)If 0 < γ < 1, then f(x1, x2, …, xn) = yn(i.e., minimum operator).If γ < 0, then f(x1, x2, …, xn) = y1 (i.e., maximum operator).Similar to the proof of Theorem 5, the conclusion is easily obtained. □If we consider the possible values of the weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn)Tin the GOWUA-HARA operator, we can obtain a group of particular cases shown as follows:The maximum operator is found if w1 = 1 and wi= 0 (i ≠ 1).The minimum operator is derived if wn= 1 and wi= 0 (i ≠ n).Lety1=max1≤i≤n{.xi}andyn=min1≤i≤n{xi}, if w1 = α, wn= 1 − α and wi= 0 (i ≠ 1, n), thenGOWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ[(α(β1−γy1+η)λγ+(1−α)(β1−γyn+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],which includes the maximum and minimum aggregation operators.An operator named as Window-GOWUA-HARA operator is obtained if wi= 1/p(k ≤ i ≤ k + p − 1) and wi= 0(i < k and i ≥ k + p), whereWindow−GOWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ[(1p∑i=kk+p−1(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η].An operator named as Olympic-GOWUA-HARA operator is derived if wi= 1/(n − 2)(i = 2, 3, …, n − 1) and wi= 0 (i = 1, n), whereOlympic−GOWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ[(1n−2∑i=2n−1(β1−γyi+η)λγ)1/λγ−η].If dimension n in GOWUA-HARA operator is an even number, let wn/2 = wn/2 + 1 = 1/2 and wi= 0 (i ≠ n/2, n/2 + 1), thenGOWUA−HARA(x1,x2,…,xn)=1−γβ×[(12(β1−γyn/2+η)λγ+12(β1−γyn/2+1+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],where yn/2 is the n/2th largest of xj( j = 1, 2, …, n), and yn/2 + 1 is the (n/2 + 1)th largest of xj( j = 1, 2, …, n).If dimension n in GOWUA-HARA operator is an odd number, let w(n + 1)/2 = 1 and wi= 0(i ≠ (n + 1)/2), then GOWUA-HARA(x1, x2, …, xn) = y(n + 1)/2, where y(n + 1)/2 is the (n + 1)/2th largest of xj( j = 1, 2, …, n).In order to determine the weights of the GOWUA-HARA operator, we propose an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. We further construct a new optimization model which can aggregate DMs’ opinion and obtain an optimal weighting vector for the GOWUA-HARA operator.This subsection introduces an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator. The orness measure was presented by Yager (1988).Definition 7(Yager, 1988). Assume that orness is an OWA aggregation operator with weighting vector W = (w1, w2, …, wn), the degree of “orness” associated with this operator is defined as:(30)orness(W)=1n−1∑i=1n[(n−i)wi].It can be shown that when W = (1, 0, …, 0), orness(W) = 1; when W = (0, 0, …, 1), orness(W) = 0; when W = (1n, 1/n, …, 1/n), orness(W) = 1/2.The orness measure is also called the attitudinal character of the aggregation, which can be regarded as the OWA aggregation of the arguments xi= (n − i)/(n − 1) for i = 1, 2, …, n. By using this method, Yager (2004) presented the orness measure of the GOWA operator:(31)orness(W)=[∑i=1nwi((n−i)/(n−1))λ]1/λ,where λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞). If λ = 1, then the orness measure of the GOWA operator will degenerate to the orness measure of the OWA operator.Following Yager (2004), we can define an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator.The orness measure associated with the GOWUA-HARA operator is defined as:(32)orness(W)=1−γβ([∑i=1nwi(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η),where λ is a parameter such that λ ∈ ( − ∞, 0)∪(0, +∞).It can be shown that for the GOWUA-HARA operator: When W = (1, 0, …, 0), orness(W) = 1; when W = (0, 0, …, 1), orness(W) = 0. In particular, if β = 1 − γ, η → 0 and γ → 1, then the orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator will degenerate to the orness measure of the GOWA operator (Yager, 2004).The orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator satisfies(33)0≤orness(W)≤1.Noting that orness(W) is the orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator, we have thatorness(W)=1−γβ([∑i=1nwi(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η).According to Property 2 and Property 3, we obtain that1−γβ([∑i=1nwi(β1−γ×n−nn−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η)≤orness(W)≤1−γβ([∑i=1nwi(β1−γ×n−1n−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η).That is,0 ≤ orness(W) ≤ 1.This completes the proof.  □Based on Theorem 5, it is easy to obtain that limλ → +∞orness(W) = 1 and limλ → −∞orness(W) = 0. In addition, if λ1 ≥ λ2, from Property 5, we can deriveBased on the orness measure and the dispersion measure, O'Hagan (1988) developed a maximum entropy method to determine the OWA operator weights, which requires the solution to the following constrained nonlinear optimization problem under a given orness measure:(35)Minimizedisp(W)=−∑i=1nwilnwis.t.orness(W)=α=1n−1∑i=1n(n−i)wi,0≤α≤1,∑i=1nwi=1,0≤wi≤1,i=1,2,…,n.Fullér and Majlender (2003a) provided a minimum variance method, which demands the solution of the following quadratic programming problem for minimizing the variance of the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure:(36)MinimizeD2(W)=1n∑i=1n(wi−1n)2s.t.orness(W)=α=1n−1∑i=1n(n−i)wi,0≤α≤1,∑i=1nwi=1,0≤wi≤1,i=1,2,…,n.Wang and Parkan (2005) proposed the following model for minimizing the maximum disparity between two adjacent weights under a given orness measure:(37)Minimize{maxi∈{1,2,…,n−1}|wi−wi+1|}s.t.orness(W)=α=1n−1∑i=1n(n−i)wi,0≤α≤1,∑i=1nwi=1,0≤wi≤1,i=1,2,…,n.As pointed out in Wang and Parkan (2007), the above three approaches all imply the use of more information from all attributes, and there are no significant differences among the three alternative approaches except for computational simplicity or complexity. Considering the importance of the OWA weights, Wang et al. (2007) constructed the chi-square (χ2) model for determining the OWA operator weights under a given orness measure:(38)MinimizeJ=∑i=1n−1(wi/wi+1+wi+1/wi−2)s.t.orness(W)=α=1n−1∑i=1n(n−i)wi,0≤α≤1,∑i=1nwi=1,0≤wi≤1,i=1,…,n.However, these approaches mentioned above suppose that any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal weighting vector, and correspondingly there is only one orness measure to characterize the DMs’ attitude toward decision-making, and only one set of the OWA operator weights to be generated. This situation is not consistent with the reality. In fact, different DMs may have different perspectives, which can be characterized by different orness measures. As a result, there exist different sets of the OWA operator weights corresponding to different orness measures. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new method to aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights.In order to determine such an optimal aggregated weighting vector for the GOWUA-HARA operator in MAGDM, we propose a new method for determining the weights.Let αkbe the orness measure provided by the kth DM (k = 1, …, l), andW*=(w1*,w2*,…,wn*)Tbe an optimal aggregated weighting vector for the GOWUA-HARA operator. The orness measure corresponding to such an optimal aggregated weighting vectorW*=(w1*,w2*,…,wn*)Tis generally not equal to the αk(k = 1, …, l) provided by the DMs. That is,orness(W*)=1−γβ([∑i=1nwi*(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η)≠ak,(k=1,…,l).To measure the differences between orness(W*) and each αk(k = 1, …, l), the deviation variable ɛkis introduced:ɛk=|orness(W*)−αk|,(k=1,…,l).It is hoped that each deviation variable ɛk(k = 1, …, l) tends to be zero as much as possible, and meanwhile, following Wang and Parka (2007), the aggregation operator weights should be equally important and all the arguments can be equally aggregated. Therefore, by taking into account the orness measure constraint, the model should make all the weights as close to each other as possible.Based on the above analysis, the following nonlinear optimization model is constructed to determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights.(39)Minimizeφ∑k=1lθkɛk+(1−φ)∑i=1n−1(wi/wi+1+wi+1/wi−2)s.t.|1−γβ([∑i=1nwi(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η)−αk|=ɛk,0≤αk≤1,k=1,…,l,∑i=1nwi=1,wi,ɛk≥0,i=1,…,n,k=1,…,l,where φ stands for the relatively important degree of total deviation∑k=1lθkɛksuch that 0 < φ < 1, and θkdenotes the relatively important weight of the kth DM (k = 1, …, l).The model (39) is nonlinear and the optimal aggregated weighting vectorW*=(w1*,w2*,…,wn*)Tcan be obtained by using MATLAB or Lingo software package.If there is only one DM participating in the decision-making process or any individual weighting vector is equal to the optimal aggregated weighting vector, then ɛkwill be zero. In these cases, the objective function of model (39) will degenerate to the case of model (38). The main advantage of nonlinear model (39) is that it cannot only minimize the differences between the orness measure provided by each DM and the orness measure corresponding to an optimal weighting vector, but also produce as equally important weights as possible. In addition, note that the model (39) for determining the GOWUA-HARA operator weights does not follow a regular distribution, which is also the merit of the model.This section develops a new approach for MAGDM based on the GOWUA-HARA operator.For a MAGDM problem, let X = {x1, x2, …, xm} be a finite set of alternatives, C = {c1, c2, …, cn} a finite set of attributes, V = (v1, v2, …, vn)T the weighting vector of attributes such that vi≥ 0 and∑i=1nvi=1, D = {d1, d2, …, dl} a finite set of DMs, and W = (w1, w2, …, wl)T the weighting vector of DMs satisfying wi≥ 0 and∑i=1lwi=1. We assume that αkis the orness measure provided by the kth DM (k = 1, …, l), and θkis the relatively important weight of the kth DM (k = 1, …, l). In addition, we suppose that each decision maker provides his/her own decision matrixB(k)=(bij(k))m×n, wherebij(k)is given by the decision maker dk∈ D for the alternative xi∈ X w.r.t. the attribute cj∈ C.In general, MAGDM problems follow a common resolution scheme (Herrera & Martínez, 2000; Roubens, 1997), composed by the following three phases:(1)Information processing phase: Different attributes may have different measurement scales in MAGDM problem, then it is necessary to standardize the attributes so as to avoid the variance among different attributes.Aggregation phase: It combines the individual preferences to obtain a collective preference value for each alternative.Exploitation phase: It orders the collective preference values to obtain the best alternative(s).In the following we shall utilize the GOWUA-HARA operator and the weighting model (39) to propose an approach to MAGDM problem.Step 1.Standardize the decision matrixes.We suppose that there are two types of attributes, i.e., profit type attribute and cost type attribute. Let I1 be a set of benefit attributes and I2 a set of cost attributes. The decision matrixesB(k)=(bij(k))m×n(k=1,2,…,l)can be transformed into the corresponding standardization decision matrixes R(k)(k = 1, 2, …, l):R(k)=(rij(k))m×n=[r11(k)r12(k)⋯r1n(k)r21(k)r22(k)⋯r2n(k)⋮⋮⋮⋮rm1(k)rm2(k)⋯rmn(k)],k=1,2,…,l,where the real numbersrij(k)are calculated via the following formulas (Hwang & Yoon, 1981):(40)rij(k)=aij(k)maxiaij(k),j∈I1,i=1,2,…,m,(41)rij(k)=miniaij(k)aij(k),j∈I2,i=1,2,…,m.Calculate the weights of the attributes.Considering that each DM provides the corresponding decision-making matrix and different DMs may have different preferences for the same attribute, it is necessary to calculate the weight of attributes under each DM. In this case, we only need to consider the orness measure of this DM, in other words, ɛkin model (39) will be zero. Then we utilize the following model(42)Minimize∑i=1n−1(vi(k)/vi+1(k)+vi+1(k)/vi(k)−2)s.t.1−γβ([∑i=1nvi(k)(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ−η[∑i=1nvi(k)(β1−γ×n−in−1+η)λγ]1/λγ)=αk,0≤αk≤1,∑i=1nvi(k)=1,vi(k)≥0,i=1,…,n;k=1,2,…,l,to calculate the weighting vector V(k) of attributes of the kth decision matrix (k = 1, 2, …, l):V(k)=(v1(k),v2(k),…,vn(k))T,(k=1,2,…,l).Aggregate the decision matrixes into a collective decision matrix.Utilize the weighting vector V(k)(k = 1, 2, …, l) of attributes and the GOWUA-HARA operatorGOWUA-HARA(ri1(k),ri2(k),…,rin(k))to aggregate the whole individual decision matrixesR(k)=(rij(k))m×n(k=1,2,…,l)into a collective decision matrixR˜=(r˜ik)m×l, wherer˜ik=GOWUA-HARA(ri1(k),ri2(k),…,rin(k))=1−γβ[(∑j=1nvj(k)(β1−γrij(k)+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],(i=1,2,…,m,k=1,2,…,l).Determine the weights of DMs.For ith alternative (i = 1, 2, …, m) in the collective decision matrixR˜=(r˜ik)m×l,when aggregatingr˜ik(k=1,2,…,l), we need to determine the weights of DMs for the importance of each DM's evaluation may be different. Considering that different DMs may have different orness measures, we utilize model (39) to obtain the optimal weighting vector W of DMs:W=(w1,w2,…,wl)T,where∑k=1lwk=1andwk∈[0,1],(k=1,2,…,l).Aggregate the collective overall preference value.Based on the collective decision matrixR˜=(r˜ik)m×lobtained by Step 3 and the optimal weighting vector W provided by Step 4, we utilize the GOWUA-HARA operatorGOWUA-HARA(r˜i1,r˜i2,…,r˜il)to aggregate the overall preference value tiof the alternative xi, whereti=GOWUA-HARA(r˜i1,r˜i2,…,r˜il)=1−γβ[(∑k=1lwk(β1−γr˜ik+η)λγ)1/λγ−η],(i=1,2,…,m).Rank the collective overall preference value ti(i = 1, 2, …, m) in descending order.Select the best alternative.Based on the fact that the greater the value tiis, the better the alternative xiis, we can rank the alternatives xi(i = 1, 2, …, m) and select the best one(s).This section provides a numerical example to examine the validity of the approach developed in Section 5. First, following Zhou and Chen (2014), we study an investment selection problem where the investor is looking for an optimal investment, and examine the effective of our approach. Second, to illustrate the influence of DMs’ risk attitude on the decision-making result, we provide a sensitive analysis of the parameters in HARA utility with respect to the best alternative.Following Zhou and Chen (2014), we suppose that an investment company wants to invest money in the best possible option, and there is a panel of five possible alternatives to invest: (1) x1 is a computer company; (2) x2 is a car company; (3) x3 is a furniture company; (4) x4 is a food company; and (5) x5 is a chemical company. The investment company must consider the following six attributes while making the choice: (1) c1 stands for expected benefit; (2) c2 denotes technical ability; (3) c3 indicates competitive power on market; (4) c4 represents ability to bear risk; (5) c5 expresses management capability; and (6) c6 refers to organizational culture. Suppose that there are four decision experts d1, d2, d3 and d4.Based on the assumption of Zhou and Chen (2014), we suppose that the decision experts’ assessments for alternatives are shown as in Tables A.1–A.4 (see Appendix A). Throughout the numerical analysis, to simplify the calculation, we assume that λ = 2 in the GOWUA-HARA operator, and that the relatively important weight of DMs and the relatively important degree of total deviation in model (39) are respectively θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = θ4 = 1/4 and φ = 0.5. Noting that different DMs may have different perspectives toward decision-making which can be characterized by different orness measures, we then assume that there are four DMs whose orness measures αk(k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are 0.60, 0.50, 0.70, 0.40, respectively. In addition, the parameters’ values of HARA utility are respectively given by: β = 4, η = 2 and γ = 0.3, which are drawn from Cox and Huang (1989) who discussed the problem of portfolio selection for an investor with HARA utility.According to the approach developed in Section 5 and the given parameters, we can rank the order of enterprises by applying MATLAB or Lingo software package. The concrete steps are shown as follows.Step 1.Standardize each decision matrixes B(k) into the matrices R(k)(k = 1, …, 4) via Eq. (40), which are shown as in Tables A.5–A.8 (see Appendix A). Here we use only Eq. (40) due to the attribute uj∈ I1 for all j.Utilize the model (42) to calculate the weighting vector of attributes w.r.t. the DM dk:V(1)=(0.2689,0.2238,0.1723,0.1327,0.1074,0.0949)T,V(2)=(0.1870,0.1807,0.1712,0.1611,0.1526,0.1474)T,V(3)=(0.3789,0.2496,0.1505,0.0959,0.0684,0.0567)T,V(4)=(0.1249,0.1335,0.1496,0.1726,0.1991,0.2203)T.Aggregate the matrices R(k)(k = 1, 2, 3, 4) into a collective decision matrixR˜=(r˜ik)5×4by using the GOWUA-HARA operatorr˜ik=GOWUPA-HARA(ri1(k),ri2(k),…,ri6(k)),(i=1,…,5;k=1,…,4):R˜=[0.90940.81980.99280.77230.89890.79830.94730.83390.78070.87640.88550.71310.86300.92260.94430.76410.91430.83730.91950.7696].Compute the weighting vector of four experts based on the model (39) to derive:W=(0.2633,0.2553,0.2447,0.2367)T.Aggregate the collective overall preference value tiof the alternative xibased on the GOWUA-HARA operatorti=GOWUA-HARA(r˜i1,r˜i2,r˜i3,r˜i4),(i=1,…,5):t1=0.8758,t2=0.8714,t3=0.8159,t4=0.8754,t5=0.8619.Rank the collective overall preference value ti(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in descending order:t1>t4>t2>t5>t3.Select the best alternative.Rank the alternatives xi(i = 1, 2, …, m) in accordance with the collective overall preference values ti(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):x1≻x4≻x2≻x5≻x3.Thus, the best investment alterative is the computer company x1. This result coincides with the case of Zhou and Chen (2014), which implies that our method is effective.Note that introducing the utility function influences not only the DMs’ evaluation about the input argument information (See formula (18)), but also the weights of attributes and the DMs (see formula (39)). From the formulas of (18) and (39), however, it is difficult to find that what role the parameters of HARA utility function play in the selection of the best alternative.Based on the parameters given by Subsection 6.1, the following Table A.9 (see Appendix A) shows the impact of changing the parameters of HARA utility function on the best investment alternative, including the changing of single parameter (no. 1 to no. 15), two parameters (no. 16 to no. 30), three parameters (no. 31 to no. 35), respectively.From the single parameter change in Table A.9, we find that the selection of the best alternative will change with the single parameter γ(or η) decreasing or with the parameter β increasing to a certain point (see, no. 1 to no. 15). In other words, the changing of single parameter has an influence on the selection of the best alternative.For example, the best alternative will change from x1 to x4 as the parameter γ(resp. η) decreases from 0.9 to 0.01(resp. from 5 to 0.6) (see, no. 1 to no. 10), while this change will happen as the parameter β increases from 0.1 to 15 (see, no. 11 to no. 15). Moreover, the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) will decrease with the rise of γ or η, while it will increase with the rise of β (see, no. 1 to no. 15). This can be explained by the first partial derivative of the absolute risk aversion coefficient. Note that the first partial derivative of r(x, γ, β, η) for HARA utility is r'γ(x, γ, β, η) = −β2x/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 ≤ 0, r'η(x, γ, β, η) = − β(1 − γ)2/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 < 0 and r'β(x, γ, β, η) = η(1 − γ)2/(βx + η(1 − γ))2 > 0, respectively. Then, we can conclude that r(x, γ, β, η) will decrease with the increasing of γ or η, while it will increase with the increasing of β.In addition, we see that from Table A.9 the changing of two parameters (or three parameters) will also affect the selection of the best alternative. In particular, the best alternative will change with the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increasing to a certain point, and this changing tendency is also suitable for the single parameter case.For example, under the condition of single parameter γ, the best alternative will change from x1 to x4 when the absolute risk aversion coefficient r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.18 to 0.95 (see, no. 1 to no. 5). For the case of two parameters γ and η, the best alternative will change from x1 to x4 when r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.37 to 1.14 (see, no. 16 to no. 20). Under the changing of three parameters, the best alternative will change from x1 to x4 when r(x, γ, β, η) increases from 0.54 to 1.33 (see, no. 31 to no. 35).This situation can be understood by the meaning of r(x, γ, β, η). Notice that with the absolute risk aversion coefficient increasing, the risk attitude of DM's involved in the evaluation of decision-making information will become more prudent. In other words, the higher the risk aversion is, the more conservative the DM is (Arrow, 1965; Pratt, 1964). From Tables A1 to A4, we find that the alternative x4 is better than the alternative x1 with respect to the attributes c1, c3, c4 and c5. Recall that c1, c3, c4 and c5 respectively denote the expected benefit, competitive power on market, ability to bear risk and management capability. These attributes, for the security of the investment in reality, draw more attention than those of c2 (technical ability) and c6 (organizational culture). Therefore, from the viewpoint of investment safety, the alternative x4 is superior to the alternative x1 with the increasing of r(x, γ, β, η).In addition, Table A.9 shows that no matter what the changing of parameter (single parameter, two or three parameters) is, the best alternative is still x1 if the value of r(x, γ, β, η) is less than 0.95, while it will become x4 when the value of r(x, γ, β, η) is larger or equal to 0.95. Here, we should note that the point of r(x, γ, β, η) equal to 0.95 is only suitable for this example because the calculation of the best investment alternative involves other factors such as the values of attributes, weights of attributes and experts, orness measure, the relatively important weight of DMs, the relatively important degree of total deviation.Compared with the existing aggregation approaches, the main characters of our developed approach can be concluded as follows.(1)By introducing the utility function in aggregating process, the GOWUA-HARA operator can reflect the DMs’ risk attitude toward input argument information which is characterized by the three parameters (γ, η and β) of HARA utility function, while the existing aggregation operators do not take into account this point. For instance, the aggregation operator derived by Zhou and Chen (2014) mainly focuses on its structure and importance of arguments, and does not consider the DMs’ risk attitude toward the input argument information.A new weighting model is constructed to determine the weights of DMs, which aggregates all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. That is, the different perspectives of different DMs can be characterized by a comprehensive orness measure, which overcomes the case of the existing weighting methods only using one orness measure to characterize DMs’ perspectives. For example, Zhou and Chen (2014) put forward the generalized least squares method (GLSM) to calculate the weights of DMs, and they supposed that each DM's weights were equal to the optimal weights of DMs. In this case, this method neglects the fact that different DMs may have different perspectives characterized by different orness measures.Compared with the existing aggregation approaches, in our approach, the DMs’ risk attitude characterized by the three parameters (γ, η and β) may influence the selection of the best alternative. Indeed, in practice, the DMs’ subjective attitude toward the evaluation of arguments has an impact on the choice of the best alternative.
