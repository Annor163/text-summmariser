This paper proposes an improved multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm named multi-objective hybrid differential evolution with simulated annealing technique (MOHDE-SAT) to solve dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) problem. The proposed MOHDE-SAT integrates the orthogonal initialization method into the differential evolution, which enlarges the population diversity at the beginning of population evolution. In addition, modified mutation operator and archive retention mechanisms are used to control convergence rate, and simulated annealing technique and entropy diversity method are utilized to adaptively monitor the population diversity as the evolution proceeds, which can properly avoid the premature convergence problem. Furthermore, the MOHDE-SAT is applied on the thermal system with a heuristic constraint handling method, and obtains more desirable results in comparison to those alternatives established recently. The obtained results also reveal that the proposed MOHDE-SAT can provide a viable way for solving DEED problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Dynamic economic dispatch (DED) is an important task in the power system operation, it allows for more advanced treatment of economic dispatch (ED), and the main goal is to operate electric power systems at minimum total fuel cost while satisfying system inequality and equality constraints [1]. However, the increasing public awareness of environmental protection has forced to improve the operational strategy for reducing pollutant emission of thermal units, several strategies must be taken to reduce the atmospheric emissions, they often include installation of cleaning equipment, switching to low emission fuels, replacement of aged fuel-burners with clearer ones and emission dispatch. The first three choices require installation of new equipment and/or modifications of the existing ones that need considerable capital outlay, which can be considered only as long-term options [2–4].Then emission dispatch becomes another crucial objective in the power dispatch, and DED has been extended to environmental/economic dispatch (DEED) problem, which needs to optimize the fuel cost and pollutant emission simultaneously. However, the consideration of pollutant emission will increase the fuel cost, DEED can be taken as a multi-objective problem (MOP) with non-commeasurable and contradictory objectives, many approaches and methods have been proposed to solve this problem [5–9].In conventional way, the DEED problem is converted into a single objective by linear combination with given objective weights [10–13], literature [14] presents DED based on a simulated annealing (SA) technique for the determination of the global or near global optimum dispatch solution, literature [15] proposes Maclaurin series based Lagrangian method (MSL) to solve the DED problem for generating units with valve-point effect, considering the ramp-rate limits and spinning reserve constraint, Pattern search (PS) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are presented to solve DEED problem with linear-weighted methods [16,17]. Though it can improve the optimization mechanism and obtain some satisfactory results, it has three drawbacks: (i) It may fall into local optima, and lead to premature convergence problem; (ii) It takes a series of separate runs to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions; (iii) The objective weight can be difficult to obtain in reality.Afterwards, some multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to optimize these objectives simultaneously and produce a set of non-dominated solutions for decision-making, such as niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) [18], non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) [19], strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) [20], multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) [21–23], and multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) [24], and so on. In this paper, an improved multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve this DEED problem.Differential evolution (DE) was originally proposed by Storn and Price for optimization problems over the continuous space [25], it is a simple yet powerful population based direct search algorithm for optimizing problems using real value parameters. In comparison to other evolutionary algorithm, DE is more ease of use and higher speed of evolutionary convergence. Within a short span of about fifteen years, DE has been widely used to solve single objective global optimization problems owe to its simple optimization structure, great robustness and fast convergence rate. Due to its high efficiency for dealing with single objective problems, DE has been extended to solve those MOPs in the continuous domain. Pareto differential evolution was initially proposed by Abbass with applying DE to MOPs [26], and then achieved good results by Madavan's Pareto differential evolution approach (PDEA) [27]. Then Xue et al. introduced multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) with its individual fitness using pareto-based ranking [28], Rolic and Filipic's differential evolution for multi-objective optimization (DEMO) obtained good results with its efficient population update strategy [29]. Though these methods can obtain a set of desirable results, they also fall into premature convergence problem that all evolutionary algorithms suffer.In this paper, an improved multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the DEED problems. The orthogonal initialization is implemented to enlarge the search scale before the population evolution, and the annealing technique is used to control the population diversity in the mutation operator adaptively, which can avoid premature convergence problem to certain degree. In additional, a new diversity metric of Pareto front is also integrated into the external archive set to control the diversity distribution, which can provide the most representative non-dominated solutions for decision-making. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied on the thermal system for solving the DEED problem, and obtains the satisfactory non-dominated schemes and trade-offs of DEED problem.This paper is organized as follows: the problem formulation of DEED is shown in Section 2, the basic principles of multi-objective optimization are introduced in Section 3, the proposed multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm and the implementation of the proposed algorithm are presented in Section 4 and Section 5, and the obtained results of case study are given in Section 6.The DEED problem is to minimize the fuel cost and pollutant emission synchronously while satisfying various equality and inequality constraints of physical requirement and system load demand of thermal units, which are shown as follows:The objective of ED is to minimize the total fuel cost of thermal power system, which is presented as the summation of fuel cost in N generating units for T intervals over the given dispatch horizon, it can be described as follows [17]:(1)minF1=∑t=1T∑i=1N[fi(Pi,t)]where F1 denotes the total fuel cost of thermal power system, fi(Pi,t) represents the thermal cost of the ith thermal unit at the tth time interval, Pi,tis the generated power in the ith thermal unit at tth time interval, T is the length of total dispatch period, N is the number of thermal units.Traditionally, the generator cost curve is presented in form of quadratic functions of thermal power, which is represented as follows [17]:(2)fi(Pit)=ai+biPit+ciPit2where ai, bi, ciare the coefficients of fuel cost in the ith thermal unit. However, since the wire drawing effects will occur when steam admission valve starts to open, the above presentation cannot reflects the sharp increase of fuel cost in reality. For modeling the DEED problem accurately, the generator cost curves of thermal power unit can be represented by quadratic functions with sine components of valve loading effects [19]:(3)fi(Pit)=ai+biPit+ciPit2+disin(ei(Pi,min−Pit))where ai, bi, ci, di, eiare the coefficients of the ith thermal unit, Pi,min is the minimum output of the ith thermal unit.As more concern about pollutant emission of thermal units, the emission rate of harmful substance becomes the focus of environmental problem. Due to the main effects of harmful substance caused by the nitric oxide (NOx), the emission rate of nitric oxide is often taken as another objective in the power dispatch [30]. And the total emission rate of thermal system is presented as follows [19]:(4)minF2=∑t=1T∑i=1Nei(Pit)where ei(Pit) represents the emission rate of the ith thermal unit at tth dispatch interval, it is often described as [19]:(5)ei(Pit)=αi+βiPit+γiPit2+ζiexp(λiPit)where αi, βi, γi, ζi, λiare the coefficients of emission rate at the ith thermal unit.(1) System load balance constraint [17]:(6)∑i=1NPit=PDt+PLtwhere PDtdenotes the system load at tth dispatch interval, PLtrepresents the transmission loss at tth time interval, it also can be expressed as follows:(7)PLt=∑i=1N∑j=1NPitBijPjt+∑i=1NB0iPit+B00where Bij, B0iand B00 are loss coefficients of generation units.(2) Power generation limits [17]:(8)Pi,min≤Pit≤Pi,max,i=1,2,...,N,t=1,2,...,Twhere Pi,min, Pi,max are the minimum and maximum outputs of the ith thermal unit.(3) Generating unit ramp rate limits [17]:To ensure the thermal output on the feasible domain, the ramp limits are described as below:(9)Pit−Pi,t−1≤URiPi,t−1−Pit≤DRi⁡i=1,2,…,N,t=1,2,…,T.where URi, DRiare the up-ramp and down-ramp limits of the ith thermal unit.Due to the non-commeasurable or conflictive characteristics of multiple objectives in the real world, a set of optimal individuals instead of single optima are produced in one simulation run with Pareto dominance relationship, and among these individuals, no individual can be considered to be better than other ones respect to all objective functions, these solutions are named as Pareto-optimal solutions, which are selected from population set according to the Pareto domination rank [31].For a given multi-objective optimization problem, it can be generally formulated as follows [19]:(10)MinF(x)={minf1(x),minf2(x),…,minfk(x),…,minfK(x)}(11)Subjectto:gi(x)=0,i=1,2,…,Mhj(x)≤0,j=1,2,…,HWhere fk(x) denotes the kth objective function, K represents the number of objectives, gi(x), hj(x) are the equality and inequality constraints, and M,H are the numbers of equality and inequality constraints. In the optimization process, if there are two feasible individuals x1, x2, the dominance relationship between them is presented as follows:Dominance relationship: x1 dominates x2, which is also labeled as x1≻x2, if the following conditions are satisfied:(12)∀k∈{1,2,…,K}:fk(x1)≤fk(x2)If some of above conditions are violated, the individual x1 does not dominate the individual x2. If it exists an individual x* that no individual dominates in the population set, then x* is denoted as the Pareto or non-dominated individual.Due to the effectiveness of DE in single objective optimization, DE has been extended to the multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm. This paper improves MODE by modified mutation operator with simulated annealing method, and the orthogonal initialization technique is also utilized to raise the optimization efficiency. Furthermore, the entropy based crowding diversity metric is used for increasing the diversity distribution of obtained Pareto front, and the simulation on the proposed algorithm is verified with some benchmark problems.DE is a simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm proposed by Storn and Price, it is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, which was motivated by the mechanisms of natural selection for optimization problems over a continuous domain. DE starts to explore the search space by selecting random initial candidates under boundary limits, and locates the global optimal solution by redefining the population with reproduction and selection [32].Generally, DE has three evolutionary operators: mutation, crossover and selection. For each individualxig, it generates a mutated individualvigwith two other random individualsxjg,xkg(j≠k≠i)in the mutation operator, which is formulated as follows:(13)vig=xig+F(xjg−xkg)Where F is commonly known as scaling factor, which is a positive real number in [0,1]. It controls the convergence rate at which the population evolves. After the mutation process, DE uses a binomial crossover operator is used to generate the candidate individualuigfrom the mutated individualvigand current individualxigat crossover probability Cr, which is described as follows:(14)ui,tg=vi,tgifrand()≤Crort=random(1,n)xi,tgifrand()>Crort≠random(1,n)whereui,tgis the tth dimensional decision variable ofuig, rand() generates random number in [0,1], and random(1, n) denotes a random integer between 1 and n.While the selection operator mainly takes charge of choosing the better individual between current individualxigand candidate individualuig, it can be expressed as follows:(15)xig+1=uigifuigisbetterthanxigxigotherwiseAccording to the above procedures, the evolutionary population can be evolved generation after generation until the stopping criteria is satisfied.After encoding those individuals, the evolutionary population must be properly initialized. Here, an orthogonal initialization method is integrated into the differential evolution to enlarge the population diversity.Orthogonal initialization method with orthogonal array (OA) and factor analysis was developed to sample a small but representative set of combination of experimentation to obtain good combinations [33]. OA is a factorial array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, each row represents the levels of factors in each combination and each column represents a specific factor that can be changed from each combination.When there are S factors (variables), and each factor can be divided into Q levels, the search space can consist of QScombination levels. For a given boundary [li, ui] of decision variable, each variable can be divided into Q levels αi1, αi2, …, αiQ, all those variables have QNlevels, and each level αijcan be presented as follows:(16)αij=li+j−1Q−1⋅(ui−li)when Q and N are large, it may impossible to do all QNexperiments to obtain optimal solutions. Therefore, it is desirable to sample a small, but representative set of combinations for experimentation, and based on the sample, the optima may be estimated. Here, the row R of OA is estimated by QJ, and the proper Q and J must be properly found with satisfying the following conditions:(17)minimize:R=QJsubjectto:C=QJ−1Q−1≥n,R≥NpWhere C is the estimation of the number n of decision variables, Npdenotes the size of evolutionary population. If C>n, delete the additional C–n columns to get an OA with n factors.Though DE has been used to solve multi-objective optimization problems and obtains desirable results to certain extent, it also suffers premature convergence problem that all evolutionary algorithms suffer. In order to overcome this problem and accelerate convergence rate simultaneously, mutation and archive retention strategies are improved to increase the convergence rate, and modified crossover operator is adopted to control the population diversity with simulated annealing technique, which can avoid the premature convergence problem efficiently.The scaling factor in mutation operator is a constant in formulation (13), and it controls the evolutionary process at a fixed convergence rate, which cannot adjust to the population evolution as good algorithm does. Here, the scaling parameter is modified to a decreasing function, which is expressed as follows:(18)F=e−agnow/gmaxwheregnowrepresents the current generation number, gmax denotes the maximum generation number, and a is a positive control parameter. In the formula (18), it is clear that scaling parameter decreases as the current generation number increases. When the constant parameter is replaced in the formulation (13), the population evolution can explore the search space widely at the beginning and rapidly at the end. However, when evolutionary population converges to certain optima, it cannot get away from the premature convergence problem and fall into local convergence.According to the formula (13) in Section 4.1, it is found that the search speed of differential evolution is invariable due to its constant scaling parameter F, evolutionary population diversity also decreases at certain rate, when evolutionary population converges to certain optima, it cannot get away from falling into the local convergence, which leads to the premature convergence problem. In order to avoid this problem, the simulated annealing technique is taken to check the variation of evolutionary population and then control the population diversity especially when evolutionary population converges.Simulated annealing (SA) was originally used in statistic mechanics with Metropolis criterion [34], and then was used to solve the optimization problem by Kirkpatrick [35]. The SA optimization algorithm can be considered as an analogous to the physical process in which a material changes state while minimizing its energy [36].The SA algorithm starts at high temperature T0, a sequence of points are generated until a sort of “equilibrium” can be approached, which denotes that the objective values of a sequence of points xgreach a stable value as g increases and this stable value can be taken as the optimal value.For a given initial temperature Tr, check the deviationdev(Tr)between the current individualxigand generated individualuig, which can be described as:(19)dev(Tr)=∑j=1mfj(xig)−fj(uig)To increase the population diversity in the differential evolution, the modified crossover rate is used to increase the acceptable probability of generated individuals, and the Eq. (14) can be improved to the following formulation:(20)ui,tg=vi,tg,ifrandom≤e−dev(Tr)/Trxi,tg,ifrandom>e−dev(Tr)/TrAccording to the above formulation, it is found that the acceptable probability increases greatly especially when evolutionary population converges(uig→xig), which can properly avoid the premature convergence problem.In order to retain elite individuals generated in the differential evolution, the external archive set is generally utilized to store those Pareto individuals after each generation, which can also promote the population convergence. Since the archive set has certain size, not all the Pareto individuals can be stored in the archive set, Deb's truncation strategy is often needed to keep the elitism as the evolution proceeds [37].When the number of Pareto individuals exceeds the size of external archive set, truncation mechanism must be taken to keep the elitism of the archive set. According to the diversity metric proposed by Deb [38], an entropy based crowding distance method is utilized to estimate the density of those obtained Pareto individuals by calculating the average distance of two individuals on either side of this individual along each of the objectives, and diversity distribution of the obtained Pareto front can be retained to certain extent. However, the distribution of this individual is not taken into consideration, and the average distance cannot properly reflect the crowding degree of those Pareto individuals.In the Fig. 1, the distribution C is disorderly distributed while distribution A and B are evenly distributed. In order to measure the diversity distribution properly, the entropy concept is utilized to describe the distribution characteristics of obtained Pareto front. In the literature [39], the upper and lower adjacent distances of each individual are employed to calculate the distribution entropy. Actually, some upper and lower adjacent distances are calculated repeatedly, which will increase the computational complexity. Here, only the lower adjacent distance is used to estimate the distribution entropy, which is defined as follows:(21)Ei=−pilog2(pi)pi=dli∑k=1Np−1dlkdli=∑j=1mfj(xi)−fj(xil)where Eiis the entropy of the ith individual in the archive set, piis the relative distance of the ith Pareto individual, dlidenotes the distance of the ith individual to its lower individual in the archive set, and xilrepresents the lower individual of the ith Pareto individual.According to the relative distance of Pareto individual, it is seen from Fig. 1 that distribution characteristics in A and B can be different even though they are evenly distributed, distribution B has small relative distance which cannot meet the distribution requirement of obtained Pareto front, while the distribution A can better fit the entire Pareto front under the fixed size of archive set.Here, the diversity of obtained Pareto front can be described as the summation of the entropy of Pareto individuals, which can be formulated as:(22)diversity=1log2(Np−1)∑i=1Np−1Eiwhere diversity is in the range [0,1]. It is seen that the Pareto front will be evenly distributed if the entropy of relative distance is 1. Hence, this diversity metric can be used to retain the elite individual in the archive set, which has been introduced in the Section 4.3.3.The entire flowchart of the proposed multi-objective differential evolution algorithm can be implemented as follows (Fig. 2):To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, some benchmark problems of ZDTs have been considered. Here, ZDT1, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6 are taken for comparison with other alternatives established recently. Generally, there are two goals of multi-objective optimization: (1) Obtain solutions as close to the true pareto front as possible; (2) Get more evenly distributed Pareto-optimal solutions. Here, Deb's convergence and diversity metrics are used to measure these two characterizes [37].The main parameters of MOHDE-SAT are set as follows: Crossover rate is set as 0.3, and to match settings of established algorithms for comparison, the size of population set is 100, and the archive set is also set as 100, total evolution run for 250 generations.Figs. 3–6show the pareto fronts obtained by MOHDE-SAT and the true pareto fronts of four ZDTs test problems, it is seen that obtained pareto-optimal solutions are almost evenly scattered on the true pareto front. Table 1also presents the mean and variance values of convergence meric and diversity metric with comparison to other contradistinctive alternatives after 10 simulations run, the value of upper cell denotes mean value of convergence or diversity metric, and the value of lower cell gives the varance of convergence or diversity metric.Those different results in Table 1 are obtained by Deb's NSGA-II [37], Lei and Wu's SPEA2 [40], Xue's PDEA [28], Madavan's PMODE [27], Rolic and Filipic's DEMO [29] and Qian and Li's ADEA [41]. The convergence metric in Table 1 reveals that MOHDE-SAT can get both best convergence and most stable performance in comparison to other comparative methods, while NSGA-II, SPEA2, PMODE, PDEA and ADEA all have difficulties in converging to true pareto fronts, and the diversity metric also presents its more uniformly distributed population diversity combining with the diversity distribution in Figs. 3–6.Though the proposed multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm has been efficient in dealing with those ZDTs problems, DEED is a non-linear constrained problem, and some implementation mechanisms of this proposed MOHDE-SAT must be presented to solve the DEED problem. In the DEED problem, the orthogonal initialization method is utilized to diversify the initial population, and a heuristic technique is used to handle the non-linear constraint in the DEED problem.In the DEED, the main goal is to obtain the power generation scheduling of those thermal units, and the generated output of each thermal unit is taken as the decision variable in the DEED problem. For a given individual, it consists of N generating units under T time intervals. And the encoded individual can be described as follows:(23)X=p11p21⋯pN1p12p22⋯pN2⋮⋮⋮⋮p1Tp2T⋯PNTSince the ramp rate constraint of thermal output is considered, the maximum and minimum out of each time period cannot be easily described by formula (8). For each time interval, the feasible interval can be modified as follows:(24)[Pi,t,min,Pi,t,max]=[Pi,min,Pi,max]∩[Pi,t−1−DRi,Pi,t−1+URi]where Pi,t,min, Pi,t,max are the minimum and maximum bounds of output of ith thermal unit at tth time period. Here, the orthogonal initialization is utilized to disperse the initial individuals among the above feasible interval as it is described in Section 4.2.In the DEED, constraint-handling technique of those equality and inequality constraints has great influence on the efficiency of solving this problem. The DEED has one set of equality constraints and two sets of inequality constraints, among which inequality constraints can be properly handled, while equality constraint handling has been a headache problem [42]. Here, a heuristic constraint-handling method is used to properly handle this equality constraint with coarse adjustment and fine tuning technique, which can be presented in detail as follows:Step 1: Set the scheduling time interval t=1;Step 2: Calculate the violation ΔPtbetween the total output of thermal units and system load by formula (25), if the violationΔPt<εp, then go to step 5; Otherwise, go to step 3;(25)ΔPt=∑i=1NPi,t−PD,t−PL,tStep 3: Modify the output of each thermal unit equally with above violation on coarse adjustment by formula (26), if the modified output exceeds the boundary limit, let it equal to the nearest bound of thermal output in formulation (24), and go to step 4; Otherwise, go to step 5;(26)Pi,t=Pi,t−ΔPt/NStep 4: Modify the output of the rth thermal unit with formulation (26) on fine tuning adjustment, and calculate the violation again, ifΔPt<εpis satisfied, go to step 5; Otherwise, go to step 2;Step 5: The time interval t=t+1, if t<T, go to step 2; Otherwise, exit all the constraint handling procedure.After the above constraint handling technique, infeasible individuals have been modified with coarse and fine tuning method. However, those modified individuals can also be infeasible individuals since the adjustment operation is under finite iteration numbers, and a feasible selection strategy is needed to choose those modified individuals. For a given individual Xi, the total violation of Xican be presented as:(27)Totalvio(Xi)=∑t=1TΔPtIfTotalvio(Xi)<εis satisfied (ɛ is the permitted accuracy), the individual Xican be considered as feasible individual, and otherwise it is infeasible. Generally three norms of feasible selection mechanism are followed [37]: (i) If two individuals are both feasible, choose the individual that has higher dominance rank; (ii) If one individual is feasible and the other is infeasible, choose the feasible one; (iii) If two individuals are both infeasible, choose the individual that has less violation.After obtaining those pareto-optimal solutions, the decision maker may need to choose one compromise solution according to the specific preferences of different applications. The jth objective value of the ith Pareto solution can be represented by a membership function according to the imprecise nature of human adjustment, and the membership function can be formulated as:(28)uij=0Fj(xi)>maxFjmaxFj−Fj(xi)maxFj−minFj,minFj≤Fj(xi)≤maxFj1Fj(xi)<minFjwhere minFjdenotes the jth objective value satisfactory to the decision maker, maxFjis the objective value that is completely unsatisfactory, and it is seen that this membership function represents the achievement degree of Pareto-optimal solution.For a given Pareto individual xi, the membership function can be normalized as follows:(29)ui=∑j=1Muij∑i=1NA∑j=1MuijThe Pareto solution with maximum membership is taken as the best compromise solution in the archive set, which can be provided for decision-makers in application.The proposed MOHDE-SAT is applied on the environmental/economic dispatch problems, which has been introduced in the Section 2. Here, three test systems are presented to verify the efficiency of the MOHDE-SAT, test system 1 is a dynamic environmental/economic dispatch model, it consists of five generator units in 24h with each interval of one hour, and the system data including transmission loss coefficients and system load demand of each hour has been presented in literature [43]. Test system 2 is a ten-unit system with non-smooth fuel cost and emission level functions without considering transmission loss. Test system 3 takes transmission loss into consideration based on test system 2, all the details of this test system are introduced in reference [19].In test system1, the test system consists five power generation units with considering both cost and emission problem, non-linear power generation loss is also taken into consideration. Here, the proposed MOHDE-SAT is used to solve this problem and taken comparison with other methods, and compromise scheme is also taken as the best candidate scheme for decision makers.30 non-dominated schemes obtained by MOHDE-SAT and MODE are presented in Table 2, it is seen that both the thermal cost and emission cost obtained by MOHDE-SAT are almost smaller than that of MODE, the minimum cost and minimum emission obtained by MOHDE-SAT is 46,478 $ and 17884lb, which are both smaller than that of MODE. In addition, these non-dominated schemes are presented as pareto optimal fronts depicted in Fig. 7. It is found that the obtained pareto optimal front by MOHDE-SAT has more desirable distribution than that of MODE.According to the membership function introduced in Section 5.5, membership indexes of those schemes have been calculated, and scheme (16) can be properly taken as the compromise scheme. And more details about scheme (16) are shown in Table 3, it can be seen that the output constraint of each thermal unit and ramp rate of each time period are properly satisfied, and output loss of each time period cannot exceed 2% of load demand.In Table 4, the obtained results are taken comparison to SA, MSL, EP, PS in literature [14–17], it is shown that MOHDE-SAT has better minimum cost and minimum emission than other methods, and compromise solution can have both better cost and emission than most of other alternatives, it proves that MOHDE-SAT cannot only produce good compromise scheme but also extreme value of Pareto optimal front, which can provide reliable and viable way for MOHDE-SAT to solve this problem.The main parameters are set as follows: The generation number is set to 1000, and the size of evolutionary population and archive set are set to 50 and 30. The control parameter a is set to 0.2, and Q and J are taken as 5 and 3. The permitted accuracies in handling system load balance ɛpare set to 0.01, and the permitted total accuracy ɛtotalis set to 0.1. Furthermore, the total run time of obtained pareto schemes is 873s with 29.1s for generating each scheme, which can be also more efficient than other optimization methods.This test system extends the five power units to ten power units and do not takes transmission loss into consideration. The proposed MOHDE-SAT is used to tackle with this problem, ramp rate limits and system load balance can be properly handled, MODE is taken into comparison with MOHDE-SAT under the same parameter setting.There are 30 non-dominated schemes obtained by MOHDE-SAT and MODE in Table 5, these schemes are sorted by Cost ($) in ascend order while Emission (lb) in descend order. The cost is in the range of 2,360,000 to 2,460,000, and emission is between 260,000 and 280,000. In Fig. 8, it is clearly seen that the Pareto optimal front obtained by MOHDE-SAT is obviously better than that obtained by MODE both on the convergence ability and diversity distribution.Moreover, MOHDE-SAT can obtain extreme value of Pareto optimal front on both upper and lower sides, which also means that it can provide more comprehensive candidate schemes especially when the cost or emission is merely considered. With the membership indexes introduced in Section 5.5, scheme (18) is taken as the compromise scheme, and the output details are listed in Table 6.In Table 6, the output of each generation units are properly controlled according to the limits in literature [19], and the summation of all the outputs equal the load requirement at each hour, which also satisfies the load balance constraint. Furthermore, it also can be concluded that the first five units bear more output requirement than the last five units, the first five units have larger output capacity, so they should take more output to meet the load balance requirement.The main parameters are set as follows: The maximum generation is set to 1000, and the size of evolutionary population and archive set are set to 50 and 30. The control parameter a is set to 0.4, and iteration number Q and J are taken as 5 and 2. The permitted accuracies of handling system load balance ɛpare set to 0.01, and the permitted total accuracy ɛtotalis set to 0.1. Furthermore, the total run time of MOHDE-SAT on this test system is 118s with 3.93s to generate each scheme.This test system extends power system to ten power generation units in comparison to test system 1, and nonlinear power loss is also taken into consideration in formulation (7), the data details is shown in literature [19]. Here, we still utilize the constraint-handling technique introduced in Section 5.3, the thermal output can be properly controlled in an acceptable accuracy. In addition, the MODE is taken into comparison with the same parameter setting while utilizing the constraint-handling technique.In Table 7, 30 non-dominated schemes obtained by MOHDE-SAT and MODE have been presented, cost is sorted in ascending order while emission is in descending order. The cost and emission by MOHDE are almost both smaller than that of MODE, which also can be seen in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9, the obtained pareto optimal front by MOHDE-SAT can totally dominate that of MODE, and it also has been distributed more evenly than MODE due to the entropy diversity method.In addition, scheme (18) is also taken as compromise scheme by evaluation method introduced in Section 5.5, and the evaluation indexes of obtained schemes have been caculated. Since the evaluation method in Section 5.5 is similar to the decision process of TOPSIS, the scheme in the middle of obtained pareto front is often taken as the compromise scheme, which can also be seen in the Fig. 9.Furthermore, the output details of compromise scheme are shown in Table 8, obtained output of each power unit at each time period is under control, ramp rate of each unit is also properly satisfied, and total loss of each power unit in 24h cannot exceed 5% of system load demand. Since scheme (18) is taken as the best compromise scheme in the candidate schemes, output process of this scheme can also be the best output plan for decision makers.In comparison to NSGA-II, RCGA, MADM and MODE, the obtained results have been listed in Table 9, MOHDE-SAT has better cost and emission results in both minimum cost and minimum emission model, it ensures that extreme values of Pareto optimal front have been included. Furthermore, compromise scheme acts efficiently in results as well as in run time, which motives the proposed MOHDE-SAT to be a viable alternative for solving this problem.The main parameters of this test system are set as follows: The generation number is set to 1000, and the size of evolutionary population and archive set are set to 50 and 30. The control parameter a is set to 0.4, and Q and J are taken as 10 and 2. The permitted accuracies in handling system load balance ɛpare set to 0.01, and the permitted total accuracy ɛtotalis set to 0.1. Furthermore, the total run time of obtained pareto schemes is 977s with 32.57s for generating each scheme.
