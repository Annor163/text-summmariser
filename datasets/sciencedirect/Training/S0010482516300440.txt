@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
High-throughput computer screening (based on flexible molecular docking) is a computational technique used to search for possible interactions between different molecular structures such as proteins (receptors, enzymes etc.), nucleic acids, ATP, drug candidates [36,37,41,6] or more exotic compounds [11] and various biologically active substances [1,14,3]. In addition, it provides an effective method in solving fundamental problems [17,2,38,9] in the field of biophysics and biochemistry [13,32,43]. The same approach turns out to be applicable to the study of the substrate specificity of enzymes, as well as to the development of their inhibitors or activators [20,44,45].The target molecule of our study, inulinase (2.1-β-D-fructan–fructan hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.7), performs hydrolysis cleaving inulin and other fructose-containing polymers to fructose. There are over 36,000 species of plants known to contain inulin. Thus, inulinase can be used for the industrial production of fructose from plant raw material, particularly from artichoke, chicory and yacon extracts [21,31,5].In the modern food production industry, enzyme samples immobilized on insoluble polymeric carriers have a number of essential technological advantages over their soluble precursors due to the fact that they: (1) are heterogeneous catalysts and can be easily separated from the reaction medium, which enables us to stop the reaction at any point, re-use the catalyst, and obtain a product not contaminated by the enzyme fraction; (2) allow for a continuous process (in flow reactors), and for the control over the speed of the catalyzed reaction. In recent years, a special focus has been made on the selection and modification of carriers, the improvement of immobilization methods, and the study of the kinetic aspects of catalysis by heterogeneous enzymatic systems. It is known that immobilization usually results in a partial loss of enzymatic activity. However, selecting an appropriate carrier may significantly increase the specific activity of the immobilized biocatalyst [21].Currently there are a lot of recent works deals with optimization of packed-bed bioreactors configuration for inulinase production [28]. An increasing interest has also been given to the search for the best operating conditions in fructose production by inulin enzyme hydrolysis [34] in terms of immobilization technique [19,30,42] and reactor type [10,35,8].A new type of support for enzyme immobilization has drawn great attention in recent years, viz. Sepabeads (a class of methacrylic polymers very suitable for enzymes immobilization in industrial purposes) [27]. Basso et al. [4] reported a rational immobilization of inulinase on Sepabeads based on homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics. The new preparation of immobilized enzyme was tested under near-industrial conditions, and a novel reactor configuration for fructose production from inulin was proposed and tested. Experiments were run in batch and continuous reactors.Adsorptive and covalent ways of immobilization for inulinase on synthetic cation-exchanger and anion-exchanger were developed, allowing to preserve 80–85% of activity of native enzyme [23].To date, few studies have been carried out the conditions of the inulinase production and its application to heterogeneous biocatalysts and biosensors. Studying the mechanisms of inulinase immobilization will enable us to expand the knowledge about the processes of the enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides and improve the existing technological ways of producing fructose [15,16,25,26,39,7].The aim of this work is to offer a high-affinity molecular agent that would bind tightly to the inulinase enzyme without disturbing its enzymatic activity significantly. This ligand with the required side chain length and the «anchor» system at the ends of the macromolecule used for cross-linking could be further used as a mean for inulinase immobilizing.Flexible molecular docking was performed using the Autodock VINA package [40], whereas the preparation of the structure of the target was taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the ligands generated in the Avogadro [12] package was carried out in the MGLTools 1.5.6.rc3 program [29]. Representations of the ligand-receptor interactions were made using the LigPlot 1.3.6. package [24]. The inulinase molecule from Aspergillus ficuum, which was assigned the code 3SC7 in the database (Fig. 1), consists of 516 amino acid residues. The structure of this molecule was obtained by means of X-ray diffraction [33] with 1.5Å resolution (perfectly suitable for computer calculations using the flexible docking method). It is important to note that inulinase was crystallized together with some organic ligands, including D-mannose, which is an enzyme activator. The known position of the sugar on the enzyme surface gave us an opportunity to calibrate the selected docking package (Autodock VINA) using the example of mannose and inulinase complex. Its structure is known from X-ray diffraction analysis, and it was taken as the «reference complex». According to the docking results, the site of interaction of the modeled ligand predicted by the program is in good agreement with the localization of mannose deduced from the experiments. The affinity of such binding was −4.5kCal/mol.Prior to the measurements, water molecules were removed from the target. Furthermore, we arrayed the charge on the protein surface and selected a cell for the docking calculations, 68×58×60 angstroms in size. The center of the protein molecule (whose geometry was securely fixed) was at the point with coordinates (x=37.044; y=−36.997; z=−5.365). We used the same target parameters for screening the entire set of ligands. The list included relatively simple sugars (activators, inhibitors, enzymatic catalysis products), as well as high-molecular weight compounds (cation and anion exchange resins and fibers [18]) glycoproteins, phenylalanine-proline peptide, polylactate, and caffeine. A brief description of polycation and polyanion exchange resins may be found inTable 1.When calculating the flexible docking, each of the ligands had a maximal conformational freedom: the rotation of functional groups around all ordinary bonds was permitted. In the case of resins and fibers (polymer ligands), the chain size was limited to five monomer units – it enabled us to calculate the structures of the ligand׳s possible complexes with the target in a reasonable computational time providing the extended structure of the ligand.Adsorption immobilization (5 g carrier in 50ml acetate buffer, pH 4.5) was carried out overnight at ambient temperature. The enzyme (5ml) was added to ionite suspension and mixed in a flask on an electric mixer for 1.5h at 25°C, after which the mixture was centrifuged for 5min at 250g. Immobilized preparation obtained by adsorption was washed from protein in acetate buffer. Control was carried out at λ=280nm.The catalytic activity of the enzyme was determined by the resorcinol method [22]. Inulin (MP biomedicals) from chicory (molecular weight about 5kDa) was used as a substrate. The temperature of hydrolysis was set to 70°C, pH 4.5.The amount of the enzyme capable of producing 1μmol of fructose per 1min under the used conditions was taken as a unit of inulinase activity. The protein content was determined according to the Lowry method.
