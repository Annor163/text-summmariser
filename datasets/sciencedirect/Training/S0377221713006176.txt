@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Additive multi-attribute value models and additive utility models with discrete outcome sets are widely applied in both descriptive and normative decision analysis. Their non-parametric application allows preference inference by analyzing sets of general additive value functions compatible with the observed or elicited holistic pair-wise preference statements. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the preference inference based on a single preference statement, and sufficient conditions for the inference based on multiple preference statements. In our computational experiments all inferences could be made with these conditions. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the non-parametric analyses of general additive value models are unlikely to be useful by themselves for decision support in contexts where the decision maker preferences are elicited in the form of holistic pair-wise statements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We consider a decision problem of (partially) ordering a set of alternatives that are deterministically evaluated in terms of n>1 attributes. Preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) are assumed to be representable by an additive multi-attribute value function that is indirectly defined through holistic pair-wise judgments (i.e. alternative a is weakly preferred over alternative b,a≿b). Note that although we consider, for compatibility with the existing literature, only multi-attribute value models, the results also apply directly to multi-attribute utility models with discrete outcome sets. The Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) methodology (Corrente, Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, in press; Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013; Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008; Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2011, 2012; Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, 2011; Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012a, Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012b, 2012c, 2013a) enables non-parametric analyses of sets of preference models compatible with the given holistic pair-wise judgments. ROR methods supply the DM with two kinds of results: possible and necessary preference relations that express whether an alternative is weakly preferred over another one with some or all compatible preference models, respectively. ROR has been implemented initially for the non-parametric analyses of additive value models in UTAGMS (Greco et al., 2008).The necessary and possible relations are computed in UTAGMS by solving Linear Programs (LPs). However, their computation time can be too high for practical purposes, especially in decision contexts where the problem needs to be solved repeatedly, or with larger problem sizes. Also, it has not been known what exactly can be inferred through non-parametric analyses of additive models when the DMs express preferences as holistic pair-wise statements. Answering this question is relevant for the economical sciences as a whole, because many regression models implicitly assume an axiomatic foundation in terms of value theory (also known as utility theory with riskless decisions), and as the LP based approach seems to be appropriate also for descriptive decision analysis (Graf, Vetschera, & Zhang, 2013).In this paper, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for single preference statement inference, and sufficient conditions for multiple statement inference (Section 2). We report results of our computational experiments that measured the amount of different types of preference inferences as well as inferences that could not be made using our propositions (Section 3). The paper ends with a discussion of the propositions and the results.We consider a multi-attribute decision problem where a finite set of alternatives M is evaluated on a set of attributes indexed with S={1,…,n}. We denote the evaluation of alternative A∈M on attribute i with Ai. Without loss of generality, we assume the evaluations to be cardinal and the alternatives Pareto-optimal. The DM preferences over M are representable with a value functionu:M→R,(1)u(A)⩾u(B)⇔A≿B.We assume mutual preferential independence of the DM’s preferences (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976) and therefore u is additive and composed of partial value functions ui, that are, without loss of generality, assumed to be monotonically increasing,(2)u(A)=∑i∈Sui(Ai).The set of all such value functions isU. Let P be the set of weak preference (≿) statements provided by the DM. A value function u is compatible to P if,∀(A≿B)∈P, u(A)⩾u(B). The set of all value functions compatible to P is denoted byUP⊆U. P is said to be non-conflicting ifUP≠∅. In what follows, we assume P to be non-conflicting.Definition 1For A, B∈M such that(A≿B)∉P, ifu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, we say we are able to inferA≿Busing P.Note that ifu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, then in the UTAGMS terminology A is necessarily preferred to B.The conditions we derive for preference inference are based on examining the partial value function domains whose corresponding ranges are constrained in size by the preference statements:Definition 2Pi+andPi-are, ∀i∈S,(3)Pi-=⋃(X≿Y)∈PYi>Xi[Xi,Yi](4)Pi+=⋃(X≿Y)∈PXi>Yi[Yi,Xi]Note that when|P|=1,Pi+=[Yi,Xi]if Yi<XiandPi+=∅otherwise, andPi-=[Xi,Yi]if Xi<YiandPi-=∅otherwise. UsingPi-andPi+, the following lemma provides a condition under which preference inference is impossible.Lemma 1For A, B∈M, if ∃k∈S : Bk>Akand[Ak,Bk]⊈Pk-, then∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A).Consider an arbitraryu∈UP. We construct a new value function u′ by modifying u so thatu′∈UPand u′(B)>u′(A).Letusum=∑i[ui(maxX∈M{Xi})-ui(minX∈M{Xi})]. Furthermore, letD=[Ak,Bk]⧹Pk-and let D∗ be an arbitrary non-empty convex subset (an interval) of D, i.e. D∗ is an interval fully contained in D. Letui′=ui,∀i∈S⧹{k}, and defineuk′(x)for an ε>0 as(5)uk′(x)=uk(x)ifx⩽min{D∗};uk(x)+usum+εotherwise.Observe that u′ differs from u only by the partial value functionuk′. Moreover, for each non-empty convex subset[x,y]⊆Pk-,uk′(x)-uk′(y)=uk(x)-uk(y), and for[y,x]⊆Pk+,uk′(x)-uk′(y)⩾uk(x)-uk(y). Therefore,∀(X≿Y)∈P,(6)u′(X)-u′(Y)=∑i∈S⧹{k}ui′(Xi)-ui′(Yi)+uk′(Xk)-uk′(Yk)(7)=∑i∈S⧹{k}[ui(Xi)-ui(Yi)]+uk′(Xk)-uk′(Yk)(8)⩾∑i∈S[ui(Xi)-ui(Yi)](9)⩾0⇒u′∈UP.Furthermore,(10)u′(B)-u′(A)=∑i∈S⧹{k}ui′(Bi)-ui′(Ai)+uk′(Bk)-uk′(Ak)(11)=∑i∈S⧹{k}[ui(Bi)-ui(Ai)]+uk(Bk)+usum+ε-uk(Ak)(12)=usum-∑i∈S[ui(Ai)-ui(Bi)]+ε(13)⩾ε,and ε>0⇒u′(B)>u′(A).□Lemma 1 provides a simple condition that can be used for checking whether∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A), or in UTAGMS terminology, whether A is not necessarily preferred to B. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.Corollary 1For A, B∈M, ifu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, then[Ai,Bi]⊆Pi-,∀i∈S:Ai<Bi.Assume thatu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, and that ∃k∈S : Ak<Bkand[Ak,Bk]⊈Pk-. Now Lemma 1 implies that∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A), which contradicts the assumption.□Next we provide another condition under which preference inference is impossible. It considers a single preference statement only.Lemma 2For A, B, X, Y∈M andP={(X≿Y)}, if ∃k∈S : Ak⩾BkandPk+⊈[Bk,Ak], then∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A).If∃t∈S:[At,Bt]⊈Pt-, then Bt>At, and by Lemma 1∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A). In the remainder of the proof we consider the other case in which[Ai,Bi]⊆Pi-,∀i∈S. In particular, because all alternatives in M are Pareto optimal, ∃ℓ∈S : Bℓ>Aℓ and[Aℓ,Bℓ]⊆Pℓ-, i.e. Yℓ⩾Bℓ>Aℓ⩾Xℓ. To complete the proof, we construct a value function u and show that u(X)⩾u(Y) and u(B)>u(A).For all i∈S⧹{k,ℓ}, let ui(x)=0. Furthermore, for an ε>0, define uℓ as(14)uℓ(x)=ε,ifx>Aℓ;0,otherwise.If Xk>Ak>Yk, define ukas(15)uk(x)=2ε,ifx>Ak;0,otherwise.Otherwise Xk⩽Akor Ak⩽YK, and we define ukas(16)uk(x)=2ε,ifx>Yk;0,otherwise.Note that Xk>YkbecausePk+⊈[Bk,Ak], and therefore uk(Xk)=2ε, uk(Yk)=0. Moreover, uk(Ak)=uk(Bk). Now,(17)u(X)=uℓ(Xℓ)+uk(Xk)=2ε>ε=uℓ(Yℓ)+uk(Yk)=u(Y),and thereforeu∈UP. Furthermore,(18)u(A)=uℓ(Aℓ)+uk(Ak)=2ε,ifAk⩾Xk;0,otherwise,and(19)u(B)=uℓ(Bℓ)+uk(Bk)=3ε,ifAk⩾Xk;ε,otherwise,and by combining (18) and (19), it follows that u(B)>u(A).□Note that Lemma 2 is specific to ∣P∣=1. In particular, if ∣P∣>1, preference inference might still be possible even if the lemma holds for some(X≿Y)∈P.Corollary 2For A, B∈M and P such that ∣P∣=1, ifu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, thenPi+⊆[Bi,Ai],∀i∈S:Ai⩾Bi.Assume thatu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, and ∃k∈S:Ak⩾BkandPk+⊈[Ak,Bk]. Now Lemma 2 implies that∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A), which contradicts the assumption.□Next, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for preference inference with a single preference statement.Theorem 1single statement inferenceFor A, B, X, Y∈M andP={(X≿Y)}, it holds thatu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, if and only if ∀i∈S it holds that(20)Pi-⊇[Ai,Bi],ifAi<Bi(21)Pi+⊆[Bi,Ai],ifAi⩾BiFirst assume thatu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP. Now (20) follows by Corollary 1 and (21) follows by Corollary 2.To complete the proof, we show that when (20) and (21) hold,u(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP. We begin by dividing S into three distinct subsets:S1={i∈S|Ai<Bi},S2=i∈S|Bi⩽Ai,Pi+≠∅andS3={i∈S|Bi⩽Ai,Pi+=∅}. Note that Xi⩽Ai<Bi⩽Yi,∀ i∈S1 by (20), Bi⩽Yi<Xi⩽Ai,∀i∈S2 by (21), and Xi⩽Yi,∀i∈S3 by (21).Sinceu(X)⩾u(Y),∀u∈UP, and∑i∈S3ui(Xi)⩽∑i∈S3ui(Yi), it follows that∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Yi)⩽∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Xi). Hence,(22)u(A)=∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Ai)+∑i∈S3ui(Ai)(23)⩾∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Xi)+∑i∈S3ui(Bi)(24)⩾∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Yi)+∑i∈S3ui(Bi)(25)⩾∑i∈S1∪S2ui(Bi)+∑i∈S3ui(Bi)(26)=u(B),and thereforeu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP.□Consider a problem with M={A,B,X,Y} with the following attribute valuesAltAttr. 1Attr. 2Attr. 3Attr. 4A4224B1313X3131Y2442andP={(X≿Y)}. Now Theorem 1 allows us to inferA≿B, because[B1,A1]⊇P1+,[A2,B2]⊆P2-, and for i∈{3,4}, Ai⩾BiandPi+=∅. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.The following corollary provides a condition under which no preference inference is possible.Corollary 3For A, B, X, Y∈M andP={(X≿Y)}, if A, B, X and Y are not all distinct,∃u∈UP:u(A)>u(B)and∃u′∈UP:u′(A)<u′(B).Suppose Y=B, and henceP={(X≿B)}. First, consider the conditions foru(B)⩾u(A),∀u∈UP. Now, (20) cannot hold for an i∈S : Bi<Ai⇒Ai⩽Bi, ∀i∈S. Moreover, (21) can only hold if Xi=Bi, ∀i∈S : Ai⩽Bi. Because of the Pareto-optimality of alternatives in M, (20) and (21) cannot hold, and therefore∃u∈UP:u(A)>u(B).Second, consider the conditions foru(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP. Now, (20) simplifies to: Xi⩽Aiif Ai<Bi, and (21) simplifies to: Xi⩽Aiif Bi⩽Ai. Hence,u(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP⇔Xi⩽Ai,∀i∈S. As all alternatives in M are Pareto optimal, this is impossible, and therefore∃u′∈UP:u′(A)<u′(B).The proofs for the other cases in which A, B, X and Y are not all distinct are similar to the case Y=B given above. □In the next theorem, we provide sufficient conditions for preference inference using multiple preference statements. They are more complex than those in Theorem 1. However, both theorems similarly apply the given preference statements for bounding attribute value differences.Theorem 2sufficient conditions for multiple statement inferenceForA,B∈M,u(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP, if ∃P′⊆P such that ∀i∈S the following hold:(27)Pi′+=∅orPi′-=∅(28)(Yi,Xi)∩(Wi,Vi)=∅,∀(X≿Y),(V≿W)∈P′(29)Pi′-is convex(30)ifAi⩾Bi,thenPi′+⊆[Bi,Ai](31)ifBi>Ai,then[Ai,Bi]⊆Pi′-We would like to emphasize that the condition (28) is defined using the open intervals (Yi,Xi) and (Wi,Vi) instead of the closed intervals [Yi,Xi] and [Wi,Vi]. The condition states that the intervals formingPi′+in (3) should be disjoint, with the exception of possible overlaps at the endpoints.ProofConsider an arbitrary value functionu∈UP. LetS+=i∈SPi′+≠∅andS-=i∈SPi′-≠∅. First, observe that due to (27),∀(X≿Y)∈P′it holds that(32)minPi′+⩽Yi<Xi⩽maxPi′+,∀i∈S+,(33)minPi′-⩽Xi<Yi⩽maxPi′-,∀i∈S-,and due to (28) and (32),(34)∑i∈S+uimaxPi′+-uiminPi′+⩾∑(X≿Y)∈P′∑i∈S+(ui(Xi)-ui(Yi)).Next, note that ∀i∈S⧹(S+∪S−), Xi=Yifor every(X≿Y)∈P′, and in particular ui(Xi)=ui(Yi). Therefore, as by definition u(X)⩾u(Y) for every(X≿Y)∈P′, it follows that(35)∑i∈S+(ui(Xi)-ui(Yi))⩾∑i∈S-(ui(Yi)-ui(Xi)),∀(X≿Y)∈P′.Hence, summing (35) over all preference statements in P′ yields(36)∑(X≿Y)∈P′∑i∈S+(ui(Xi)-ui(Yi))⩾∑(X≿Y)∈P′∑i∈S-(ui(Yi)-ui(Xi)),and applying (29) gives(37)∑(X≿Y)∈P′∑i∈S-(ui(Yi)-ui(Xi))⩾∑i∈S-uimaxPi′--uiminPi′-.Then, by combining 34, 36 and 37,(38)∑i∈S+uimaxPi′+-uiminPi′+⩾∑i∈S-uimaxPi′--uiminPi′-,which can be rewritten as(39)∑i∈S+uimaxPi′++∑i∈S-uiminPi′-⩾∑i∈S+uiminPi′++∑i∈S-uimaxPi′-.Now, asminPi′-⩽maxPi′-(33), it follows for any subset S′−⊆S−(33) that(40)∑i∈S+uimaxPi′++∑i∈S′-uiminPi′-⩾∑i∈S+uiminPi′++∑i∈S′-uimaxPi′-.We will use (40) to show that u(A)⩾u(B). To do so, first observe that due to (30), ∀i∈S : Ai⩾BieitherPi′+=∅, orPi′+≠∅in which caseBi⩽minPi′+⩽maxPi′+⩽Ai. Also, observe that due to (31),∀i∈S:Bi>Ai,Pi′-≠∅andminPi′-⩽Ai<Bi⩽maxPi′-. Based on these observations, (27) allows us to conclude thatPi′-≠∅,∀i∈S:Bi>Ai, and therefore(41)Bi⩽minPi′+⩽maxPi′+⩽Ai,∀i∈S+.Furthermore, we introduceS^-={i∈S-|Ai<Bi}. Note thatS^-⊆S-. Now, it holds that(42)minPi′-⩽Ai<Bi⩽maxPi′-,∀i∈S^-.Moreover, Ai⩾Bi,∀i∈S⧹(S+∪S^-). Using (40)–(42) we derive(43)u(A)=∑i∈S+ui(Ai)+∑i∈S^-ui(Ai)+∑i∈S⧹(S+∪S^-)ui(Ai)(44)⩾∑i∈S+uimaxPi′++∑i∈S^-uiminPi′-+∑i∈S⧹(S+∪S^-)ui(Bi)(45)⩾∑i∈S+uiminPi′++∑i∈S-uimaxPi′-+∑i∈S⧹(S+∪S^-)ui(Bi)(46)⩾∑i∈S+ui(Bi)+∑i∈S-ui(Bi)+∑i∈S⧹(S+∪S^-)ui(Bi)(47)=u(B),and thereforeu(A)⩾u(B),∀u∈UP.□For ∣P∣=1, Theorem 2 simplifies to Theorem 1 as in that case the conditions (27)–(29) always hold.Consider a problem with M={A,B,V,W,X,Y}, the following attribute valuesAltAttr. 1Attr. 2Attr. 3Attr. 4A6622B2155V5313W4246X3531Y2464andP={(V≿W),(X≿Y)}. In this problem we cannot use Theorem 1 to infer thatA≿Bby using only one of the preference statements(V≿W)or(X≿Y). However, by applying Theorem 2 with P′=P, we can inferA≿B. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.We performed computational experiments to assess the amount of preference inferences possible using the lemmas and theorems given in the previous section, and the amount of inferences still missing as we did not provide necessary conditions for the multiple statement case. We analyzed problems with 5 attributes, 10, 20, or 50 random Pareto-optimal alternatives and 2,4,…,40 random preference statements. They are generated in such a way that ∀A, B∈M, ¬((A,B)∈P∧(B,A)∈P). In each parameter configuration we ran the experiment 10 times to assess the effect of different problem structures. Hence, a total of 600 test instances were used to measure the amounts of:1.inferences obtained through the transitivity of≿(ifA≿BandB≿C, then through transitivity of≿we can inferA≿C),impossible inferences (i.e. for a pair of alternatives(A,B),∃u∈UP:u(B)>u(A)and therefore we cannot infer thatA≿B) discovered with Lemma 1,non-transitive inferences discovered with Theorem 1, andinferences not discovered in steps 1 and 3, i.e. that are not part of the transitive closure and not discoverable with Theorem 1.The last statistic was measured by comparing the inferences discovered by applying Theorem 1 with the results obtained using the full UTAGMS LPs. The experiments were implemented in R and their code is publicly available at http://github.com/tommite/pubs-code/tree/master/prefinf-ejor.The sets of random preference statements were non-conflicting in all test instances(UP≠∅). The maximum amount of inferences in each instance is n2−n−∣P∣. Fig. 4presents the amount of transitive inferences as percentages of the maximums, and the percentages of impossible inferences discovered with Lemma 1. The percentages of transitive inferences increase with the amount of preference statements until reaching a saturation (with 10 alternatives this is approximately at 22 preference statements) and afterwards they decrease. With only a few preference statements the percentages of impossible inferences discovered with Lemma 1 are reasonably high, but they rapidly decrease when the number of preference statements included increase. Both of these results were expected. What is more interesting is that none of the 600 test instances contained non-transitive inferences although Examples 1 and 2 show that such instances exist. Also, there were no additional inferences discovered with the full UTAGMS LPs, i.e. all the inferences in all test instances were transitive.
