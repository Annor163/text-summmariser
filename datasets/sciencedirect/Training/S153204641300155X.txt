@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The task of recognizing and normalizing protein name mentions in biomedical literature is a challenging task and important for text mining applications such as protein–protein interactions, pathway reconstruction and many more. In this paper, we present ProNormz, an integrated approach for human proteins (HPs) tagging and normalization. In Homo sapiens, a greater number of biological processes are regulated by a large human gene family called protein kinases by post translational phosphorylation. Recognition and normalization of human protein kinases (HPKs) is considered to be important for the extraction of the underlying information on its regulatory mechanism from biomedical literature. ProNormz distinguishes HPKs from other HPs besides tagging and normalization. To our knowledge, ProNormz is the first normalization system available to distinguish HPKs from other HPs in addition to gene normalization task. ProNormz incorporates a specialized synonyms dictionary for human proteins and protein kinases, a set of 15 string matching rules and a disambiguation module to achieve the normalization. Experimental results on benchmark BioCreative II training and test datasets show that our integrated approach achieve a fairly good performance and outperforms more sophisticated semantic similarity and disambiguation systems presented in BioCreative II GN task. As a freely available web tool, ProNormz is useful to developers as extensible gene normalization implementation, to researchers as a standard for comparing their innovative techniques, and to biologists for normalization and categorization of HPs and HPKs mentions in biomedical literature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The biomedical text mining researchers try to devise automated systems to extract relevant knowledge from biomedical literatures. The two preceding steps to complex biomedical text mining tasks are the automatic recognition of named entities such as genes/proteins names mention (GM) and their subsequent gene normalization (GN) to map to an entry in standard databases like EntrezGene or UniProt [1]. These pre-processing steps are highly desirable to understand the associations between the entities like interactions between proteins, genes associated with diseases, etc. GN task is syntactically easier when compared to GM as the identification of textual boundaries for each entity is not required. Yet, it is considered to be important in scientific communications to mark clear and unambiguous reference to genes/proteins [2]. GN is highly challenging due to the widespread of existing gene/protein entities and lack of rules or algorithms concerning nomenclature. Further many existing entities are known by more than one name and some of the newly discovered genes/proteins have been assigned with already existing names [3].Various approaches available for GN include classification techniques [4,5], rule-based systems [6,7], string matching with dictionaries [8,9] and hybrid approaches [10]. Apart from the general approaches, different organisms might require different normalization strategies depending on the complexity of the nomenclature and the degree of ambiguity in the assigned synonyms [4]. Currently available systems like GeNo [10], GNAT [11], Moara [12] and Whatizit [13] are species specific and facilitate human GN as a subtask. The incompetence of such systems on human GN task is evident from their inability in identifying complex human gene/protein names (e.g. IkappaBalpha/beta). Normalization systems exclusively designed for human gene/protein mentions are very rare [14] and no system is available for human protein kinases (HPKs). The HPKs are the largest human gene family regulating multiple biological processes by posttranslational phosphorylation. These are essential for many cellular signaling networks coordinating various activities like metabolism, stress response, transcription, translation, DNA replication and cell cycle control, development of organs, neuronal signaling and apoptosis. Any malfunction of this regulatory machinery often leads to various diseases and disorders [15–17]. Specialized normalization on protein kinases might be more specific and robust to extract related information from biomedical literature. The importance of human GN is also evident from BioCreAtivE-II GN task [18] which explicitly emphasis on human genes/proteins.We present here a tool, ProNormz for human GN task. ProNormz, an integrated approach incorporates a hybrid tagger NAGGNER [19] which is previously developed by us for tagging human genes/proteins, a specialized synonyms dictionary for human proteins and protein kinases, an enhanced set of 15 string matching rules and a disambiguation module to achieve the normalization. ProNormz is the first available approach to categorize HPKs from other HPs in addition to normalization task. We utilized the protein kinase information from two protein kinase databases KinBase [20] and Kinweb [21] to categorize the HPKs from other HPs. Additionally, ProNormz also has another named entity tagger BANNER [22] for GM task alone.ProNormz is implemented as a freely available web-based tool. Fig. 1shows the web interface and Fig. 2shows the overall architecture. ProNormz consists of four major functional components for the recognition of human gene/protein mentions and mapping them to their corresponding EntrezGene unique identifier.(i)NAGGNER – biomedical named entity tagger developed by us to identify possible mentions of gene/protein names.A specialized synonyms dictionary for HPs and HPKs.A set of string matching rules to compare the tagged entity with all entries in the dictionary.A disambiguation method if tagged entity maps more than one gene in the dictionary.We have developed the above mentioned GN tasks separately as Java and Perl/CGI modules. The details of these modules are discussed below.Gene/protein name recognition is named entity recognition (NER) task and aims to locate gene/protein mentions (GM) in biomedical literature. The gene/protein name recognition is achieved by our earlier developed tagger NAGGNER available at (http://biominingbu.org:8080/NAGGNER/) [19] or another popular open source tagger BANNER available at (http://cbioc.eas.asu.edu/banner/) [22]. The Java API of NAGGNER/BANNER supports its integration to ProNormz for implementing the GM task.The goal of ProNormz is to normalize human protein/genes and distinguish human protein kinases from other proteins/genes. For this task, the system incorporates two specialized synonyms dictionaries one for human proteins and other for human protein kinases. Later entries in both dictionaries were mapped to single dictionary.Creation of synonym dictionary for human genes/proteins: The main purpose of gene/protein synonym dictionary is to provide the actual EntrezGene database identifiers to the gene/protein mentions in text. First, we downloaded all the human genes/proteins approved by Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) using the keyword “(Homo sapiens [Organism]) AND HGNC” from EntrezGene [23]. For the HGNC approved genes/proteins the synonym name dictionary was developed using three resources (i) the synonym dictionary provided by the BioCreAtIvE-II [18] contest, which is composed of 32,975 entries, (ii) the human protein/gene name dictionary available at NCBI [23] covering 47,177 entries and (iii) the human protein synonyms available at UniProt [24] covering 14,893 entries. These dictionaries contain many gene entries which are not approved by HGNC and few discontinuous genes. Combining all the dictionaries, we created a gene/protein synonyms dictionary which contains only the HGNC approved genes/proteins with all possible synonyms available from all the three resources.Creation of synonym dictionary for human genes/protein kinases: Next, we created human gene/protein kinase synonym dictionary to distinguish human protein kinases from other proteins. We downloaded all the human genes/protein kinases approved by HGNC using the keyword “(Homo sapiens [Organism]) AND Kinase AND HGNC”. Additionally, we downloaded HPK from two popular databases namely KinBase [20] which contains 516 HPKs and Kinweb [21] which contains 518 HPKs. Most of the entries were common to both the databases with few notable errors such as (i) genes not approved by HGNC, (ii) genes without official symbol, (iii) discontinued genes and (iv) gene ID replaced with a different gene ID. For the HGNC approved genes/protein kinases the synonym dictionary was constructed by combining entries in both datasets.Final synonym dictionary for human genes/proteins and kinases: Consequently, we created a final synonyms dictionary by combining both dictionaries with matched entries in both dictionaries as ‘HUMAN PROTEIN KINASE’ and the remaining entries as ‘HUMAN PROTEIN’. For all HGNC approved human genes/proteins our final dictionary contains (i) official symbol, (ii) gene ID, (iii) all possible synonyms and (iv) disambiguation as HP and HPK. Table 1shows a snippet of our final gene/protein synonym dictionary.In biomedical literature, researchers continue to mention gene/protein names in many different ways (e.g. arginase 2, arginase2, arginase-2, arginase II, type II arginase, arginase type II, etc.). These orthographical or morphological term variations are the major obstacles hindering the effective use of a gene/protein dictionary. A vital step to map the gene/protein mentions with the corresponding entries in the dictionary is unattainable without uniformity in nomenclature. String matching is a critical step prior to normalization to attain this evenness and used by several existing state of the art systems [8,12,25].We make use of 15 string matching rules, classified into two main categories as dictionary rules and entity rules. The dictionary rules were applied to dictionary terms as well tagged entities and includes morphological and syntactic variations, such as(1)Normalization of case.Replacement of hyphen with space.Removal of all space.Elimination of word delimiter features (i.e. semicolon, colon and comma).Removal of contents inside parenthesis.Replacement of Arabic numbers to Roman numerals.Removal of stop words.Removal of extra words.Replacement of British spelling to American English.The first eight rules were derived from the earlier work of Cohen et al. [26] and Fang et al. [14]. The ninth rule replacement of British to American English was first introduced by us as we found many human proteins (e.g. adaptor protein CMS/adapter protein CMS, tumour necrosis factor alpha/tumor necrosis factor alpha) exist in British English.Next, we applied a set of entity rules to tagged entities in the text before matching the dictionary text. These rules were used if slash (“/”) exists on the tokens inside the tagged text (e.g. Brk/STAP-2, ERK1/2, PKCalpha/beta). None of the existing string matching system cover the special character ‘/’ which is commonly used to mention a group of genes/proteins. The only earlier attempt was simple separation of two different protein names by Hu et al. [27]. However, we came out with a new set of six rules to handle all possible ways of using ‘/’ within the protein mentions.(10)Part of gene name.Divider for protein synonyms.Separator for two or more proteins.Identifier for proteins sorted with an alphabet at the end.Identifier for proteins sorted with a number at the end.Barrier for proteins with Greek letters.All the above 15 string matching rules used in ProNormz were shown in Table 2with specific examples.When a synonym in a gene/synonym dictionary is associated with more than one gene identifier, then recognition of appropriate gene in such cases is a challenging task and needs a disambiguation method. In ProNormz, we employed a simple disambiguation method introduced by Koike and Takagi [28]. First, we created a dictionary of ambiguous synonyms and their corresponding official gene IDs. Next, we consider all possible gene IDs for any ambiguous synonym by matching more than one official gene ID. Finally, we look for the occurrence of any of these gene IDs within the text and calculate their frequency. The possible gene ID for any synonym was the one repeated many times in the same literature.Another unique feature of ProNormz is the classification of HPKs from HPs. Following the protein name mapping and normalization, our system performs an additional step to classify the normalized protein names as ‘HUMAN PROTEIN KINASE’ or ‘HUMAN PROTEIN’ using our final specialized synonym dictionary for human genes/proteins and kinases discussed earlier. An illustrated example of ProNormz gene normalization methodology was shown in Fig. 3.
