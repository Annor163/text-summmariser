@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Mathematical modelling has been used to comprehend the pathology and the assessment of different treatment techniques such as heart failure and left ventricular assist device therapy in the cardiovascular field. In this study, an in-silico model of the heart is developed to understand the effects of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) as a pathological scenario, with mechanisms described at the cellular, protein and organ levels. This model includes the right and left atria and ventricles, as well as the systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins.First, a multi-scale model of the whole heart is simulated for healthy conditions. Subsequently, the model is modified at its microscopic and macroscopic spatial scale to obtain the characteristics of IDC. The extracellular calcium concentration, the binding affinity of calcium binding proteins and the maximum and minimum elastances have been identified as key parameters across all relevant scales. The modified parameters cause a change in (a) intracellular calcium concentration characterising cellular properties, such as calcium channel currents or the action potential, (b) the proteins being involved in the sliding filament mechanism and the proportion of the attached crossbridges at the protein level, as well as (c) the pressure and volume values at the organ level. This model allows to obtain insight and understanding of the effects of the treatment techniques, from a physiological and biological point of view.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of mathematical models in the simulation of cardiac dynamics plays an important role in understanding cardiac physiology and pathology and possible treatment techniques. Early studies were performed to understand and simulate healthy cardiac dynamics at the physiological scale [1,2] or to describe cardiac contraction [3]. For example, researchers have developed several time varying elastance models for modelling the ventricular at the organ level. Mathematical functions took over the role to initiate the simulation of the haemodynamics at the organ level [4–10]. In these models, the activation function was defined using trigonometric, polynomial or exponential functions. In time varying elastance models, only blood pressure and volume can be simulated. However, in a failing heart a number of changes occur due to pathophysiologal mechanisms at different levels of biological organisation.In this light, some models have tried to understand the underlying mechanisms of contraction by increasing the level of complexity of mathematical models used to describe them, via the addition of relevant processes at different biological scales. For instance, Arts et al. [11] described the relationship between left ventricular pressure and volume, as well as systolic fibre stress and strain in the wall [11] driven by an activation function to simulate the haemodynamics over a cardiac cycle. This model simulates the contraction of a single fibre at microstructural level, and extends this to a complete ellipsoid ventricle at microscopic level assuming homogeneous distribution and function of all muscle fibres, thus rendering ventricular haemodynamics. Cox et al. [12] used this model to describe the right ventricular haemodynamics in a healthy and pathological configuration by modifying the wall volume and zero pressure volume in the left ventricle [12]. Díaz-Zuccarini and LeFevre [13] modelled the contraction of a sarcomere and defined the ventricle as a cylinder. Also here, the ventricular dynamics were obtained with the assumption of a uniform sarcomere distribution in the ventricle.Other models focus on cardiac cells and include the generation of the action potential. For example, the Luo–Rudy model [14] is widely used in electrophysiological literature to describe the ion fluxes and channel currents of a ventricular myocyte resulting in the transmembrane (action) potential. The numerical reconstruction of the ventricular action potential is based on a Hodgkin–Huxley type approach [15]. An advanced model of the Luo–Rudy model is given by Livshitz and Rudy [16] accounting for the ion channel kinetics, calcium handling, and dynamic changes in the intracellular/extracellular milieu during the action potential. To consider the relevance of intracellular calcium dynamics during the excitation contraction coupling process (ECCP) of a myocyte, the sliding filament model (SFM) [17] describes its interaction and sensitivity with myofilaments within a sarcomere at the protein level.The cardiac cell models mentioned above have been used to simulate physiological and clinical situations. However, these models do not take into account the connection between different biological scales, which is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology as a holistic process. Various approaches have been undertaken to understand the coupling between microscopic and macroscopic elements of the cardiac contraction and its physical mechanisms using mathematical models. Bhattacharya-Ghosh et al. presented a blueprint for a multi-scale model of the ventricle [18]. This model describes events in which relevant mechanisms are mathematically described and coupled at the protein, cellular and organ scales in order to provide a better understanding of the combined ECCP as a whole. However, this model does not incorporate the four heart compartments and circulatory loop.In this work, a model of the heart and circulation, involving the representation of multiple scales and multiple physical processes based on [18] is presented under healthy conditions at first. Subsequently, the model is applied for a case study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), which is the most common type of non-ischemic (i.e. not related to coronary artery disease) cardiomyopathy and a major cause of congestive heart failure [19].The case of IDC was chosen as an example because its hypertrophic effects at the organ level are relatively simple to illustrate. The dilation of the heart is rather complex in terms of modelling, as it involves changes at the cellular and protein level as well. Cardiomyopathies are conventionally treated with inotropic support, diuretics and moderate exercise, or a mechanical circulatory assist device implantation [20]. The optimum choice of treatment is patient specific and not always clear.Within this case study, specific adjustments undertaken at each scale (cellular, protein and organ level) of a healthy heart model demonstrate typical symptoms of IDC and the feasibility of using multi-scale models as a way to understand complex diseases.A multi-scale model (MSM) of the heart has been developed, with biological scales ranging from the protein to the organ level. A schematic diagram of the multi-scale model of the whole heart from the protein (microscopic) level to the organ (macroscopic) level is shown in [18].The different components of this model will be described in the following sub-sections.In this model, the contraction of the heart was initiated by the physiological processes based on the ventricular MSM, incorporating the Livshitz–Rudy (LR) model [16] at its cellular level for the generation of an action potential.The cardiac action potential is generated by the orchestrated activity of a number of depolarising and repolarising currents, such Na+, K+, and Ca²+.In this model, Eq. (1) describes the time-dependent membrane potentialVm(1)dVmdt=(Istim−IionCm)with the specific membrane capacitance per unit area of membraneCm, the total ionic currentIion, and the stimulus currentIstim. The action potential is generated by the change in total concentration of each specific ion. There is strong interdependency between all other ions involved to describe the process of ventricular contraction and relaxation.In vivo, pacemaker cells initiate an electrical signal, propagating from one cell to adjacent cells and leading to their contraction. In this model, a stimulus current of 0.5ms in duration and a strength of 80µA/cm² with a pulse frequency equal to the heart rate, excites the entire system.Ca2+ currents play a major role for the ECCP as its intracellular concentration is tightly regulated at different levels. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+] is the basic prerequisite initiating the process of contraction in the ECCP, as [Ca2+] determines the strength of contraction [21]. A normal Ca²+ homoeostasis is important for an efficient heart beat and its muscle contraction and myocardial excitability [22].The LR model accounts for the dynamic changes in ionic concentrations, such as [Ca2+], buffers for [Ca2+] like calmodulin (cmdn) and troponin (trpn) in the myoplasma, and ionic fluxes during the action potential. The [Ca2+] is the key signalling ion that initiates the contraction of the heart within this model. Its calculation is based on the “conservation of calcium” described in [16] determined at the cellular level by Eq. (2)[23],(2)[Ca2+]=2bmyo2−3cmyo3cos×(acos(9bmyocmyo−2bmyo3−27dmyo/2(bmyo2−3cmyo)²)3)−(bmyo3)with the variablesbmyo([mM]) (Eq. (3)),cmyo([mM2]) (Eq. (4)) anddmyo([mM3]) (Eq. (5)) defining the buffering properties of calcium within the cell according to [23]. These buffering properties are determined by the time dependent and total concentration of free and buffered intracellular calciumCait2+, as well as the constantscmdnmax(max [Ca2+] buffered in calmodulin),trpnmax(max [Ca2+] buffered in troponin),kcmdn(equilibrium constant of buffering for calmodulin), andktrpn(equilibrium constant of buffering for troponin) (Fig. 3).(3)bmyo=cmdnmax+trpnmax−Cait2++kcmdn+ktrpn(4)cmyo=kcmdnktrpn−Cait2+(kcmdn+ktrpn)+trpnmaxkcmdn+cmdnmaxktrpn(5)dmyo=−ktrpnkcmdnCait2+Further details on the calculation ofCait2+, taking into account the extracellular calcium concentration[Cao]are presented inTable 1 and in [16,23,24].The applied MSM uses [Ca2+] to connect the cellular level (LR model) to the protein level (SFM) [17].At the protein level, the sliding filament model (SFM) represents the interactions between [Ca2+] and the cardiac myofilaments within a sarcomere. It describes the crossbridge kinetics (Fig. 1) based on the evaluation of data from isolated hearts in guinea pigs. The amount of crossbridgesXB, determined in the sliding filament model (SFM), is also intimately related to [Ca2+], and therefore also provides an indication of the strength of contraction in the heart. Responsible for this contraction mechanism in cardiac muscle at the sarcomere level are two protein chains. The actin–myosin sliding mechanism is well documented in cardiac literature [25] and is based on the chemical reactions of attachment and detachment between the actin (A) and myosin (M) chains. The sliding mechanism between the actin (A) and myosin (M) filaments [26,27] is shown in Fig. 1, with dependence on the binding of Ca2+ to troponin C (TnC) on the actin myofilament (TnCA).The protein tropomyosin, blocks actin from binding in the relaxed state of sarcomere contraction. During state 1 (top left) there is no force generated by myosinheads due to their detached phase. Following, calcium binds to troponin C (TnC) and exposes the crossbridge binding sites from tropomyosin (state 2) to allow myosinheads attach in the next state 3. Ca2+ then is bound and myosinheads are in an attached state [28]. During a so called “powerstroke” the thin filaments are forced (pulled) away from its original position and the length of the sarcomere is shortened in state 4, that represents a non Ca2+-bound and force generating state.In order to be consistent with the units between the scales, the concentrations in the Livshitz–Rudy model were converted to µM before linking the cellular level to the protein scale.The different states of the SFM are governed by the following ordinary differential equations (ODE) based on [17]. Eqs. (6)–(11) represent the processes shown in Fig. 1, in which “[…]” represent one protein complex.(6)d[TnCA]dt=−K1[Ca2+][TnCA]+K3[Ca2++TnCA]+Kd′[TnCA+M]withTnCAbeing the concentration of troponin C (TnC) protein molecules bound to actin (A) myofilament,(7)d[M]dt=Kd′[TnCA+M]−Ka[Ca2++TnCA][M]−Kd′[Ca2++TnCA+M]Mdefining the concentration of thick myofilaments,(8)d[Ca2+TnCA]dt=K1[Ca2+][TnCA]−K3[Ca2++TnCA]−Ka[Ca2++TnCA][M]+Kd[Ca2++TnCA+M]whileCa2+TnCAdenotes the concentration of Ca2+ ions bound toTnCA,(9)d[Ca2+TnCAM]dt=Ka[Ca2++TnCA][M]+K2[Ca2+][TnCA+M]−(Kd+K4)[Ca2++TnCA+M]Ca2+TnCAMrepresents the concentration of attached myosinheads toCa2+TnCA,(10)d[TnCAM]dt=−K4[Ca2++TnCA+M]−Kd′[TnCA+M]−K2[Ca2+][TnCA+M]andTnCAMis the concentration of myosinheads (M) attached toTnCAin absence of Ca2+.Table 2 shows the association and dissociation rates characterising the SFM, wherebyK1andKaare described by Eqs. (11) and (12) and α and β are adjustable second-order rate constants.(11)K1=α11.5([Ca2++TnCA+M](t)+[TnCA+M](t))0.5+β1and(12)Ka=αa3([Ca2++TnCA+M](t)+[TnCA+M](t))2+βa.These presented values, based on [17], have been adjusted within a physiological relevant range to obtain results appropriate to adult physiology. The units indicate a state change by a first-order rate constant (1/s) or a second-order rate constant (1/µM.s).By knowing the maximum concentrations of the actin (TnCA) and myosin (M) myofilaments, involved in the sliding filament mechanism [18], the proportion of attached crossbridges,XA(Eq. (13)) can be determined.(13)XA=[Mmax]−[M][Mmax]Reaching the maximum concentration of 70 and 20µM would then correspond to the total concentration of actin and myosin reported in [26], respectively and indicate a full unoccupation of Ca2+ binding sites (detachedXB). Hence, the remainder of the maximum concentration (Mmax) and the actin or myosin concentration indicates the concentration of free (detached) actin or myosin, i.e. unoccupied actin sites.SinceXAis linked to the development of force during the ECCP, this variable connects the protein level (SFM) with a lumped parameter model of the LV at the organ scale as shown in [18].At the organ level, this model describes the force and pressure generation in the LV based on the fundamental electro-mechanical activity of the heart coupled with the chemo-mechanical transduction occurring at the protein level within cardiomyocytes, which allows us to calculate the energy of the cardiac muscleEmaccording to [18](14)Em=AAXA+BAXA(log(XA)−1)whereAAandBAdenote chemical reaction constants.The governing equations for the mechanical component are given by the muscular energy and force [13]:(15)Fm=FactEm+Fpas(1−Em)comprising an active and passive forceFactandFpas,respectively.FactandFpascorrespond to the ‘passive’ and ‘active’ states of the heart and are calculated as:(16)Fact=Emax(lm−l0)4(17)Fpas=Emin(lm−l0)4,withlmrepresenting the sarcomere length andl0the minimum sarcomere length andEmaxandEminare the maximum and minimum elastance respectively. These curves have been represented by a simple polynomial expression, which fitted the data from [29].Subsequently, the left ventricular pressureplv, flow and volume can be calculated, according to Díaz-Zuccarini et al. [13](18)plv=Fmn3ATlm2wherenis the number of fibres in the muscle,ATa fitting constant for the volume in the ventricle,lmthe sarcomere length andl0the minimum sarcomere length.The same equations as in the MSM of the LV, are used to describe the right ventricle with a lower maximum characteristic elastance. The maximum characteristic elastance of the right ventricle (1.75mmHg/ml) was chosen in order to obtain the desired haemodynamical values in the model, whereas the elastance of 5mmHg/ml for the left ventricle originates from Díaz-Zuccarini et al. [13].An overview of the scales described in the previous sub-sections and the parameters considered to interlink them is presented in [18].To represent the circulatory system, Windkessel [30] models are widely used in the literature. In its simplest form, a Windkessel model consists of two lumped parameters: a resistance and a compliance [31], which are attributed to blood vessels. The electric elements have explicit physiological meaning: while the resistance depends on the radius, the compliance corresponds to the elasticity of the vessel. Three-element Windkessel models additionally include an inertance effect.In the model of the circulation presented inFig. 2 the main blood vessels (systemic and pulmonary arteries and veins) are modelled using electrical analogues [32].C, R and L denote the compliances, resistances and inertances, respectively, while their indices indicate the compartment of systemic arteries (as), systemic veins (vs), pulmonary arteries (ap) and pulmonary veins (vp).The flow from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the arteries are dependent on the pressure gradients. The left ventricular volume changedVlv/dtwas modelled as the difference between the inlet flow rateQmvand outlet flow rateQavof the left ventricle(19)dVlvdt=Qmv−QavThe right ventricular volume change was described in a similar way.In the model of the atria only compliance effects were considered and the contraction of the atria was ignored. The left atrial pressure changedpla/dtwas modelled by using the left atrial complianceClaand outlet flow rate of the left atriumQmvand flow rate in the pulmonary veinQvp(20)dpladt=Qvp−QmvClaThe right atrial pressure change was described in the same way using the right atrial compliance, and the corresponding flow rates.The heart valves were modelled as ideal diodes which allow only one way blood flow. The blood flowQavthrough the aortic heart valve is described by(21)Qav=plv−pasRavHere,Ravdenotes the resistance of the aortic valve, whilepasandplvdenote the pressure in the systemic arteries and the left ventricle. The blood flow through the other valves is determined in the same manner. These allow blood to pass through the valve (i.e. resistance is low), whereas the blood is blocked by the valve when the resistance is high.Systemic and pulmonary arteries were modelled with R, C, L analogues. In the models of systemic and pulmonary veins, resistance and compliance effects were taken into account. Systemic arterial pressure and flow rate changedpasdtanddQasdtin the blood vessels are given by(22)dpasdt=Qav−QasCas(23)dQasdt=pas−pvs−QasRasLasIn the equations above,dQas/dtdenotes the change of flow rate in the systemic arteries, whereRasis the resistance of systemic arteries,Casthe compliance of systemic arteries,Lasthe inertance of systemic arteries, andpvsthe pressure in the systemic veins.The flow rate and pressure changes in systemic and pulmonary veins, as well as pulmonary arteries were described using the electrical analogue as given in [32]. These electrical analogues and the ventricular model described previously were combined in order to simulate a closed loop cardiovascular system (multi-scale) model.Fig. 3 shows the dependency between particular variables in the mathematical model across the distinct scales. The complexity of the cellular and organ level has been reduced in this figure to the essential key elements.Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is a disease of the cardiac muscle and is characterised by a dilated weaker left ventricle. Hence, its ability to efficiently pump blood is reduced.The causes of IDC are unknown but they are often related to chronic alcohol abuse, use of beta-adrenergic agonists, or hypertension [33,34]. Patients suffering from premature ventricular contractions, also referred to as extrasystole, can develop dilated cardiomyopathy. Further studies on the reductions and removal of extrasystole have confirmed the findings of the cardiomyopathy regressing [35,36]. Before a patient is diagnosed with IDC the exclusion of any other cardiac, pulmonary or systemic disease showing a similar phenotype is required [37].Congestive heart failure can have typical symptoms, such as shortness of breath and swelling of the legs due to retention of fluids. It may also cause the formation blood clots in the heart because of poor blood circulation.A failing myocardium, as it occurs in IDC, is known to display an abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling, which also comprises an isoform switching of the myofilaments and a shift of the kinetics in crossbridge cycling [38]. Patients with IDC usually are anticipated to show abnormal relaxation kinetics [39,40]. The myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness is distinguished by the relation between force and intracellular Ca2+. The normal behaviour and values will be altered due to the “remodelling” caused by IDC. Typically, a lower force is produced with a decrease in Ca2+ or a decrease in myofilament function, even if the Ca2+ transients remain unchanged [38]. In dilated cardiomyopathy Ca2+ transients are prolonged and myosin chains [41] are altered in the failing heart in strong correlation with its contractility [42,43]. A shift of the crossbridge kinetics to lower ranges slows down the crossbridge cycling [44] and may be the reason why a higher intracellular Ca2+ concentration can produce little or no increment in contractile force [45].Pieske et al. [46] supports the findings that disturbed intracellular Ca2+ handling, leading to a depressed function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [47], may be a major pathological factor for altered contractile function in human dilated cardiomyopathy.A decrease in extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) is typically related to a decrease in [Ca2+]. Subsequently, a smaller influx, hence a smaller current through the main calcium channel (L-type-channel) and an efflux of calcium ions via other channels and the SR occurs into and out of the myocyte. A reduction in the calcium dynamics and force leads to disturbances in the ECCP and [Ca2+] handling [48]. The decrease in [Ca2+] also represents a smaller amount of calcium being taken up by the SR. Additionally, Mercadier et al., [49] confirms that the velocity of SR Ca2+ uptake is decreased during a volumetric increase in the ventricle and is further depressed in pathological cases. Also, taking into consideration the assumption that not only a decrease in [Ca2+], but moreover differences in myofibrillar calcium responsiveness lead to abnormalities of contractile function in the failing myocardium [50], the model will also take into account the crossbridge kinetics at the protein level [38] adds that even if myofilament responsiveness remains unchanged, the force can highly increase just on the basis of an increase of [Ca2+]. In terms of the protein mechanisms [41], [51] suggests that the myosin light chain and heavy chain isoforms are altered in heart failure. The slowing of the crossbridge cycling rate plays an important adaptational role in terms of cardiac contractility changes [44]. In order to achieve these effects the dissociation rate of Ca²+ with Troponin C on the actin myofilament withXBattached (TnCAM) was modified (Table 2).A dilation of the left ventricle does not mean that the muscular activity (force) will increase. Actually, the thinning of the muscular wall makes the Frank–Starling mechanism fail in the case of IDC. A rightward shift of the left ventricular P–V relation is typical according to the tendency toward increased ventricular volumes in chronic heart failure [52].Findings for IDC suggested by [39,53,54] as a result of lowered elastance of the ventricular wall and alterations at the cellular and protein level leading to the typical and obtained effects of IDC are shown within the multi-scale model presented here.For this case study, and in order to capture the different aspects of IDC mentioned above, a number of parameters were changed from the ‘healthy’ heart model to represent the ‘diseased’ one. The parameter set to be modified was kept relatively small. The previously mentioned changes during IDC, are characterised within this study by modifying appropriate key parameters in the multi-scale model. The parameters representing the typical characteristics occurring during IDC, are chosen from each scale presented – protein, cellular and organ, while the central role of Ca2+ in regulating muscle contraction [22] has been taken into account.At the protein level, the shift in the myofilament function is demonstrated by a reduction of the binding affinityK4. A decrease in the dynamics of the intracellular calcium concentration, affecting the strength of contraction, is tightly related to a decrease in the constant extracellular concentration [Ca2+]. The dilation of the ventricle is closely connected to the ventricular wall stiffness, arising from the maximum elastanceEmaxand minimum elastanceEminat the organ scale. The parameters changed are presented inTable 3. The consequences of the IDC are well-known and the affected parameters are reported in the literature. However, the quantitative change rate of these parameters remains unclear. Therefore we changed these parameters to obtain an IDC heart considering the parameters of interest and similar values in the literature. The modification of these will let us obtain the volume and pressure curves typically resulting from IDC.
