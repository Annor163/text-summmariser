@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Due to environmental benefits, methyl esters biodiesel got a considerable attention as a viable substitute to petroleum-based diesel. Surface tension plays significant role in atomization of this biodiesel since it controls the combustion process inside the engine through fuel–air mixing. Experimental determination of the surface tension of biodiesel is expensive and time consuming which limits its application as substitute for petroleum-based diesel. This is because proper choice of any methyl esters for diesel engine applications depend on the value of surface tension as high value of surface tension brings about difficulty in droplet formation. This work employs computational intelligence technique on the platform of sensitivity based linear learning method (SBLLM) to develop methyl esters surface tension estimator (MESTE) which estimates surface tension of methyl esters biodiesel with high degree of accuracy. Surface tensions of eight different classes of methyl esters were estimated at different temperatures by training and testing of neural network using SBLLM. The estimated surface tensions were compared with experimental results as well as surface tension obtained from Parachor model and Goldhammer model. The outstanding performance of the developed MESTE suggests its potential in estimating surface tension of methyl esters biodiesel for enhancing the atomization in biodiesels engine applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As the demand for energy increases on daily basis, the need to compliment non-renewable energy sources remains crucial for meeting the future energy needs. Conventional petroleum-based fuels subject the environment to certain dangers as the greenhouse gases are released from these fuels. Biodiesels, in particular, methyl esters have received considerable attention as a result of its promising features such as renewability, biodegradability and environmental friendliness to mention but few [1]. With biodiesels of methyl esters, little or no modifications are needed to the standard diesel engines. Biodiesels may also be blended with petroleum-based diesel in varying proportion such as B20 (20% biodiesels, 80% petroleum-based diesel) and B5 (5% biodiesels, 95% petroleum-based diesel), depending on engines. The effects of some of these blends on standard diesel engines have been observed elsewhere [2] and the environmental impacts of their emissions have also been reported [3]. Methyl esters biodiesels are derived from animal fats and vegetable oils and consequently possess different compositions and physical properties such as surface tension that finally brings about different atomization characteristics which could affect combustion processes in engines [4]. Atomization is the first stage of fuel combustion in diesel engine in which fuel is converted to fine misted spray by allowing it to pass through a small opening under high pressure. Surface tension measures the force of attraction between molecules of fuel and biodiesel with high surface tension has molecules which are strongly attracted to one another and thereby making atomization and droplet formation difficult [5]. This creates incomplete combustion in an injection engine through disproportionate fuel–air mixing. Inadequate atomization of biodiesel reduces engine efficiency considerably. The proposed algorithm (SBLLM) allows accurate estimation of surface tension of any methyl ester so as to give insight into the appropriate one for a particular diesel engine application.The force of attraction between the molecules of liquid (termed cohesive force) is mainly responsible for the surface tension. Therefore, molecular structure plays a significant role in liquid surface tension. The proposed algorithm uses molecular weight and temperature as descriptors in order to determine the effect of temperature on methyl ester biodiesel of choice since increase in temperature reduces the surface tension of biodiesels [6].Experimental determination of biodiesel surface tension is time consuming and expensive which renders theoretical predictions and estimations essentials [6,7]. Parachor approach is one of the frequently used methods of estimating surface tension of biodiesel fuel. It involves introduction of a weight factor (of each of the fatty acid methyl esters constituent of the fuel) to correct the error associated with Dalton type mass-average equation [9]. The added weight factor thereby complicates the method of calculation [8]. Another similar approach that estimates surface tension of biodiesel by adopting Dalton type mass-average equation emerged subsequently [4]. In this case, surface tension of constituent fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from the indices of topological structure which further requires weight factor in surface tension estimation. Another approach adopted in estimating surface tension is the correlation of excess Gibbs free energy with Wilson equation as well as surface tension to Gibbs free energy [8]. However, the obtained equation is quite complicated. Density gradient theory, perturbation theory and cubic equation of states are among other methods for estimating surface tension of biodiesels [6]. This present work develops a stable and less complex model that estimates surface tension of different kinds of methyl esters biodiesel at different temperatures using their molecular weight as input to the model.This present paper introduces SBLLM in making excellent and accurate estimation of surface tension of several classes of methyl esters biodiesel at different temperatures using their corresponding molecular weight. SBLLM is among machine learning tools [10–18] that acquires pattern between the descriptor and target. Despite the fact that the model (SBLLM) is less complex, it saves computational time, achieves good stability within short period of time and eliminates local convergence. Among the uniqueness of SBLLM is its high speed in reaching the minimum error. This characteristic stands it out among other machine learning algorithms. It uses linear training algorithm for each of the layers of the two-layer feed-forward network [19]. The output of the first layer is assigned with random values and later updated using sensitivity formulas that utilize the weight associated with each of the layers. The computational time is saved while using SBLLM since its learnt weights through solving a linear system of equations which gives the corresponding local sensitivities of the least square errors with respect to input and output data points [19]. SBLLM has demonstrated its excellent predictive and generalization ability in tackling real life problem [20].The results of our modeling and simulations indicate that the developed model is capable of estimating surface tension of any class of methyl esters with high degree of accuracy. The developed MESTE is characterized with high correlation coefficients (98% and 98.7% during training and testing phase respectively), low root mean square errors (0.558 and 0.496 during training and testing phase respectively) and low mean absolute errors (0.437 and 0.336 during training and testing phase respectively).SBLLM combines several unique characteristics which enhance its generalization and predictive ability. It considers the two-layer feed-forward neural network as made up of two different one-layer neural network in which Eq. (1) relates the input and output together [19].(1)yjs=fj∑i=0Iwjixiswhere j=1, 2, 3 …, J, s=1, 2, 3 …,S, I=number of inputs, J=number of outputs, wji=weight associated with neuron j, fj=non-linear activation number and S=number of data points.The sum of the squared errors between the real and desired output is minimized in order to learn the weight (wji) associated with neuron j. Therefore, we have(2)P=∑s=1S∑j=1Jyjs−fj∑i=0Iwjixis2Eq. (2) is simplified as:(3)Q=∑s=1S∑j=1J∑i=0Iwjixis−fj−1(yjs)2Eq. (3) is minimized by equating its derivative with respect to wjpto zero. That is,(4)∂Q∂wjp=2∑s=1S∑i=0Iwjixis−fj−1(yjs)xps=0,p=0,1,2...,I,∀jThis leads to,(5)∑i=1Iwji∑s=1Sxisxps=∑s=0Sfj−1(yjs)xps,p=0,1,2...,I,∀jEq. (5) can be compressed as(6)∑i=0IApiwji=bpj,p=0,1,2...,I,∀jwhereApi=∑s=1Sxisxps,p=0,1,2...,I,∀jandbpj=∑s=0Sfj−1(yjs)xps,p=0,1,2...,I,∀jThe sensitivities of Q (new cost function) as regards the output and input data for one-layer neural network is expressed as(7)∂Q∂ypq=−2∑i=0Iwpixiq−fp−1(ypq)f'p(ypq),∀p,q(8)∂Q∂xpq=2∑j=1J∑i=0Iwjixiq−fj−1(yjq)wjp,∀p,q.The described learning method coupled with the presented sensitivity relations is used to develop SBLLM with molecular weight (MW) of the methyl esters biodiesel and temperature (as the input I) and surface tension (as the output).Furthermore, we defined Q for the intermediate layer output as(9)Q(z)=Q(1)(z)+Q(2)(z)where Q(1)(z) and Q(2)(z) are for the first and second one-layer feed-forward network.Then,(10)Q(z)=∑s=1S∑k=1K∑i=1Iwki(1)xis−fk(1)−1(zks)2+∑j=1j∑k=0Kwjk(2)zks−fj(2)−1(yjs)2The weights can be independently dealt with by solving the linear equation described by Eq. (7) so that the sensitivity with respect to zksis obtained as(11)∂Q∂zks=∂Q(1)∂zks+∂Q(2)∂zks(12)∂Q∂zks=−2∑i=0Iwki(1)xis−fk(1)−1(zks)fk'(1)−1(zks)+2∑j=1J∑r=0Kwjr(2)zrs−fj(2)−1(yjs)wjk(2)By invoking Taylor series approximation, the intermediate output is computed as(13)Q(z+Δz)=Q(z)+∑k=1K∑s=1S∂Q(z)∂zksΔzks≈0(14)Δz=−ρQ(z)∇Q2∇Qwhere p=step size.The coefficient of correlation (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the generalization performance of the developed model. The generalization performance parameters (CC, RMSE and MAE) were obtained using relations presented in Eqs. (15)–(17).(15)CC=1−∑i=1neiEexp2(16)RMSE=1n∑i=1nei2(17)MAE=1n∑i=1neiwhere Eexp, eiand n, represent experimental surface tension, error (difference between the experimental and estimated surface tension) and number of data points respectively.The dataset used in training and testing SBLLM algorithm consists of one hundred and five experimental values of surface tension of eight different classes of methyl esters biodiesel with their corresponding molecular weights and temperatures as drawn from the literature [3,21–24]. Statistical analysis was carried out on the dataset and the results of the analysis are presented in Tables 1 and 2.The consistency and applicability of the adopted dataset are demonstrated from the values of its mean, median, maximum minimum and standard deviation. The temperature and molecular weight of biodiesel show positive correlation with high percentage of coefficients with the target (surface tension). The existence of positive correlations with high coefficients suggests existence of a relationship between the surface tension of methyl esters biodiesel and their corresponding temperature and molecular weight (MW) which is made used by the proposed SBLLM.The modeling and simulation part of this research work were carried out within MATLAB environment. Before commencement of modeling and simulation, the adopted dataset (described in Section 3.1) was randomized and normalized in order to ensure stable and efficient computation. The normalized dataset was separated into two parts, training set and testing set in the ratio of 8–2. The training and the testing set of data consist of eighty-four data-points and twenty-one data-points respectively making a hundred and five data-points all together. 80% of the dataset was used to train the neural network using SBLLM with the best parameters obtained through test-set-cross-validation technique. The efficiency, generalization and predictive ability of the developed model were accessed using the testing set of data. The test-set-cross-validation technique is described in Section 3.3.The best parameters associated with SBLLM algorithm that optimize the developed model (MESTE) were searched with the aid of test-set-cross validation method. A test-set-cross-validation procedure was carried out on the dataset (described in Section 3.1) to optimize SBLLM algorithm parameters. The generalization performance evaluation criteria (CC, RMSE and MAE) were monitored for a group of parameters which include number of neurons in the hidden layer, number of epoch and the type of activation function. This action was conducted for every generated training and testing set. For a given set of fixed features, all possible values of the parameters in a given range were searched in order to identify the best values of the parameters that optimize the model. The parameters corresponding to the best values of the performance criteria were then selected by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the number of epoch using different activation functions. Optimum values of the parameters with corresponding activation function were then noted. The procedure can be summarized as follows:Step 1:One type of activation function was selected from the available activation functions.Test-set-cross-validation method was used to determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer and number of epoch that give the best performance measure.The performance and the corresponding parameters from step 2 were stored.Steps 1–3 were repeated for different activation functions.The overall best parameters that correspond to the best performance measure were selected and used to train final SBLLM based neural network.The final values for the performance criteria obtained from SBLLM were recorded for both training and testing sets.The values of the parameters that give optimum performance to the developed model are presented in Table 3.Although, large number of hidden neurons slows down the training period of a network but our developed MESTE achieves good stability within short period of time due to its adoption of small number of data-points in attaining its excellent generalization ability which further makes the time effect of large hidden neuron inconsequential [16]. Furthermore, the strategy (SBLLM) utilized by the developed MESTE also saves the computational time [19].
