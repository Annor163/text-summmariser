@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this work we present the bulk-surface finite element method (BSFEM) for solving coupled systems of bulk-surface reaction–diffusion equations (BSRDEs) on stationary volumes. Such systems of coupled bulk-surface partial differential equations arise naturally in biological applications and fluid dynamics, for example, in modelling of cellular dynamics in cell motility and transport and diffusion of surfactants in two phase flows. In this proposed framework, we define the surface triangulation as a collection of the faces of the elements of the bulk triangulation whose vertices lie on the surface. This implies that the surface triangulation is the trace of the bulk triangulation. As a result, we construct two finite element spaces for the interior and surface respectively. To discretise in space we use piecewise bilinear elements and the implicit second order fractional-step θ scheme is employed to discretise in time. Furthermore, we use the Newton method to treat the nonlinearities. The BSFEM applied to a coupled system of BSRDEs reveals interesting patterning behaviour. For a set of appropriate model parameter values, the surface reaction–diffusion system is not able to generate patterns everywhere in the bulk except for a small region close to the surface while the bulk reaction–diffusion system is able to induce patterning almost everywhere. Numerical experiments are presented to reveal such patterning processes associated with reaction–diffusion theory.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many problems in science and engineering are modelled mathematically by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Some of these problems involve coupling surface and interior (bulk) dynamics resulting in coupled systems of bulk-surface PDEs. Such systems arise naturally in many fluid dynamics applications and biological processes. In developmental biology, for example, it is essential the emergence and maintenance of polarised states in the form of heterogeneous distributions of chemical substances (proteins and lipids). Examples of such processes include (but are not limited to) the formation of buds in yeast cells and cell polarisation in biological cells due to responses to external signals through the outer cell membrane [26,27]. In the context of reaction–diffusion processes, such symmetry breaking arises when a uniform steady state, stable in the absence of diffusion, is driven unstable when diffusion is present thereby giving rise to the formation of spatially inhomogeneous solutions in a process now well-known as the Turing diffusion-driven instability [29]. Classical Turing theory requires that one of the chemical species, typically the inhibitor, diffuses much faster than the other, the activator resulting in what is known as long-range inhibition, short-range activation[10,16].Recently, there has been a surge in studies on models that couple bulk dynamics to surface dynamics. For example, Rätz and Röger [27] study symmetry breaking in a bulk-surface reaction–diffusion model for signalling networks. In this work, a single diffusion partial differential equation (the heat equation) is formulated inside the bulk of a cell, while on the cell-surface, a system of two membrane reaction–diffusion equations is formulated. The bulk and cell-surface membrane are coupled through a Robin-type boundary condition and a flux term for the membrane system [27]. Elliott and Ranner [8] study a finite element approach to a sample elliptic problem: a single elliptic partial differential equation is posed in the bulk and another is posed on the surface. These are then coupled through Robin-type boundary conditions. Burman et al. [4] recently developed cut finite element methods for coupled bulk-surface problems. In this article, single time-independent elliptic parabolic equations are coupled in the bulk and surface through non-zero flux boundary conditions. A trace finite element method has recently been proposed to study a class of coupled bulk-interface transport problems posed on evolving volumes and surfaces [12]. Again, coupling of the bulk and surface dynamics is through non-zero boundary conditions. Novak et al. [24] present an algorithm for solving a diffusion equation on a curved surface coupled to a diffusion model in the volume. Checkkin et al. [6] study bulk-mediated diffusion on planar surfaces. Again, diffusion models are posed in the bulk and on the surface coupling them through boundary conditions. In the area of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, electrospun membrane are useful in applications such as filtration systems and sensors for chemical detection. Understanding of the fibres’ surface, bulk and architectural properties is crucial to the successful development of integrative technology. Nisbet et al. [23] present detailed review on surface and bulk characterisation of electrospun membranes of porous and fibrous polymer materials. To explain the long-range proton translocation along biological membranes, Medvedev and Stuchebrukhov [22] propose a model that takes into account the coupled bulk-diffusion that accompanies the migration of protons on the surface.In most of the work above, either elliptic or diffusion models in the bulk have been coupled to surface-elliptic or surface-diffusion or surface-reaction–diffusion models posed on the surface through Robin-type boundary conditions [6,8,22–24,26,27]. Here, our focus is to couple systems of reaction–diffusion equations posed both in the bulk and on the surface, setting a mathematical and computational framework to study more complex interactions such as those observed in cell biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, developmental biology and biopharmaceutical [6,8,22–24,26,27].The coupled system of bulk-surface reaction–diffusion equations (BSRDEs) may be numerically solved using various discretisation schemes and techniques. We choose to employ the bulk finite element method [9] to numerically solve the bulk-reaction–diffusion system while the surface finite element method [7] is employed to compute numerical solutions corresponding to the surface-reaction–diffusion system. The key idea of the finite element method is that two finite element spaces are constructed, the bulk and surface finite element spaces, by taking a set of all continuous piecewise polynomial functions on each bulk simplex or boundary face element [8]. The bulk and surface reaction–diffusion systems are coupled through Robin-type boundary conditions. The coupled bulk-surface finite element algorithm is implemented in deal.II[1].Other plausible numerical methods for solving such systems include (but are not limited to) finite volume methods [5], particle methods using level set descriptions of the surface [11,14] and closest-point methods [18,19].Our article is therefore structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the coupled bulk-surface reaction–diffusion system on stationary volumes with appropriate boundary conditions coupling the bulk and surface partial differential equations. Within this section, we give some specific examples of the applications of the coupled system of PDEs. The bulk-surface finite element framework is presented in Section 3. Here we describe how the two finite element spaces are constructed to enable us to carry out the spatial discretisation of the model system. We also detail how the bulk and surface triangulations are carried out. To discretise in time, we use the fractional-step θ method coupled with the Newton method to treat nonlinearities arising from the nonlinear reactions. Numerical experiments are presented in Section 4 where we discuss how bulk dynamics influence patterning on the surface and vice versa. We conclude and discuss the implications of our studies in Section 5 as well as setting foundations for future research.In this section we present our model system which comprises a system of coupled bulk-surface reaction–diffusion equations (BSRDEs) posed in a three-dimensional volume as well as on its surface. We impose boundary conditions on the system of reaction–diffusion equations in the interior of the volume that couple internal dynamics to surface dynamics. Since we are interested in closed surfaces (whose boundary is empty) then the system of reaction–diffusion system on the surface is devoid of boundary conditions.Let Γ be a closed, compact and smooth hypersurface without boundary inRN+1enclosing a convex volume Ω. Letndenote the unit outer normal to Γ, and let U be any open subset ofRN+1containing Γ, then for any function u which is differentiable in U, we define the tangential gradient on Γ by∇Γu=∇u−(∇u·n)n,where·denotes the dot product and ∇ denotes the gradient inRN+1. The tangential gradient is the projection of the gradient onto the tangent plane, thus∇Γu·n=0. The Laplace–Beltrami operator on the surface Γ is defined to be the tangential divergence of the tangential gradientΔΓu=∇Γ·∇Γu. For a vector functionu=(u1,u2,…,uN+1)∈RN+1the tangential divergence is defined by∇Γ·u=∇·u−∑i=1N+1(∇ui·n)ni.For a bounded volumeΩ⊂RN(N=2,3)with boundaryΓ≔∂ΩandI=[0,T](T>0), let us assume thatu(x,t),v(x,t):Ω⟶Rare two chemical concentrations (species) that react and diffuse in Ω andr(x,t),s(x,t):Γ⟶Rbe two chemical species residing only on the surface Γ which react and diffuse on the bulk surface. In the absence of cross-diffusion and assuming that coupling is only through the reaction kinetics, we pose the following non-dimensionalised coupled system of BSRDEs [21]:(2.1){{ut=∇2u+γΩf(u,v),vt=dΩ∇2v+γΩg(u,v),xonΩ,t>0,{rt=∇Γ2r+γΓ(f(r,s)−h1(u,v,r,s)),st=dΓ∇Γ2s+γΓ(g(r,s)−h2(u,v,r,s)),xonΓ,t>0,with coupling boundary conditions(2.2){∂u∂ν=γΓh1(u,v,r,s),dΩ∂v∂ν=γΓh2(u,v,r,s),xonΓ,t>0.In the above,∇2=∂2∂x2+∂2∂y2+∂2∂z2represents the Laplacian operator while∇Γ2denotes the Laplace–Beltrami operator, defined as the tangential divergence of the tangential gradient.νrepresents the outward pointing normal to the surface.dΩanddΓare positive diffusion coefficients in the bulk and on the surface respectively, representing the ratio between u and v, and r and s, respectively.γΩandγΓrepresent the length scale parameters in the bulk and on the surface respectively. In this formulation, we assume thatf(·,·)andg(·,·)are nonlinear reaction kinetics in the bulk and on the surface.h1(u,v,r,s)andh2(u,v,r,s)are reactions representing the coupling of internal dynamics in the bulk Ω to the surface dynamics on the surface Γ. As a first attempt, we will consider a more generalised form of linear coupling of the following nature [18]:(2.3)h1(u,v,r,s)=α1r−β1u−κ1v,(2.4)h2(u,v,r,s)=α2s−β2u−κ2v,where α1, α2, β1, β2, κ1 and κ2 are constant non-dimensionalised parameters. Initial conditions are given by the positive bounded functionsu0(x),v0(x),r0(x)ands0(x).From now onwards, we restrict our studies to the well-known activator-depleted substrate reaction model [10,25,28] also known as the Brusselator given by(2.5)f(u,v)=a−u+u2v,(2.6)g(u,v)=b−u2v,where a and b are positive parameters. For analytical simplicity, we postulate the model system (2.7) in a more compact form given by(2.7){{ut=∇2u+f1(u,v,r,s),vt=dΩ∇2v+f2(u,v,r,s),xonΩ,t>0,{rt=∇Γ2r+f3(u,v,r,s),st=dΓ∇Γ2s+f4(u,v,r,s),xonΓ,t>0,with coupling boundary conditions (2.2). In the above, we have defined appropriately(2.8)f1(u,v,r,s)=γΩ(a−u+u2v),(2.9)f2(u,v,r,s)=γΩ(b−u2v),(2.10)f3(u,v,r,s)=γΓ(a−r+r2s−α1r+β1u+κ1v),(2.11)f4(u,v,r,s)=γΓ(b−r2s−α2s+β2u+κ2v).Applications of reaction–diffusion systems are abundant in the literature and these include (but not limited to) modelling pattern formation in developmental biology, molecular dynamics in cell motility, borne and tissue regeneration in biomedical engineering and fluid–structure interactions in fluid dynamics [13]. Specific examples are given by models describing the growth of an epitaxial layer and dendritic in developmental biology [2], GTPase molecular dynamics in cell motility [15] and soluble surfactants in fluid dynamics [3].Definition 2.1Uniform steady stateA point(u⁎,v⁎,r⁎,s⁎)is a uniform steady state of the coupled system of BSRDEs (2.7) with reaction kinetics (2.5)–(2.6) if it solves the nonlinear algebraic system given byfi(u⁎,v⁎,r⁎,s⁎)=0foralli=1,2,3,4,and satisfies the boundary conditions given by (2.2).The coupled system of BSRDEs(2.7)with boundary conditions(2.2)admits a unique steady state given by(2.12)(u⁎,v⁎,r⁎,s⁎)=(a+b,b(a+b)2,a+b,b(a+b)2),provided the compatibility condition on the coefficients of the coupling is satisfied:(2.13)(β1−α1)(κ2−α2)−κ1β2=0.For proof see Madzvamuse et al. [21].□The conditions for diffusion-driven instability for the coupled system were derived and proved in [21].The compatibility condition (2.13) will be used to select the parameters associated with the boundary conditions.In the following we present two sets of results. We use the finite element method to discretise in space with piecewise bilinear elements, and the implicit second order fractional-step θ scheme to discretise in time using the Newton method to solve the non-linearities [20].Letφ∈H1(Ω)andψ∈H1(Γ). Then, multiplying (2.7) by φ and ψ, we seeku,v∈L2(0,t;H1(Ω))andr,s∈L2(0,t;H1(Γ)), such that(3.1){{∫Ω(utφ+∇u·∇φ)=γΩ∫Ω(a−u+u2v)φ+γΓ∫Γ(α1r−β1u−κ1v)φ,∫Ω(vtφ+dΩ∇v·∇φ)=γΩ∫Ω(b−u2v)φ+γΓ∫Γ(α2s−β2u−κ2v)φ,xonΩ,t>0,{∫Γ(rtψ+∇Γr·∇Γψ)=γΓ∫Γ(a−r+r2s−α1r+β1u+κ1v)ψ,∫Γ(stψ+dΓ∇Γs·∇Γψ)=γΓ∫Γ(b−r2s−α2s+β2u+κ2v)ψ,xonΓ,t>0.In the above, we have used Green׳s identities with the boundary conditions (2.2) to obtain the boundary integrals.LetΩh⊂ΩandΓh⊂Γbe discretisations of the original domains withNΩandNΓvertices respectively. Let us take the finite dimensional subspacesVΩh⊂H1(Ω)andVΓh⊂H1(Γ). Then, we seekuh,vh∈L2(0,t;VΩh)andrh,sh∈L2(0,t;VΓh)such that for allφh∈VΩhandψh∈VΓh{{∫Ωh(uh,tφh+∇uh·∇φh)=γΩ∫Ωh(a−uh+uh2vh)φh+γΓ∫Γh(α1rh−β1uh−κ1vh)φh,∫Ωh(vh,tφh+dΩ∇vh·∇φh)=γΩ∫Ωh(b−uh2vh)φh+γΓ∫Γh(α2sh−β2uh−κ2vh)φh,xonΩh,t>0,{∫Γh(rh,tψh+∇Γrh·∇Γψh)=γΓ∫Γh(a−rh+rh2sh−α1rh+β1uh+κ1vh)ψh,∫Γh(sh,tψh+dΓ∇Γsh·∇Γψh)=γΓ∫Γh(b−rh2sh−α2sh+β2uh+κ2vh)ψh,xonΓh,t>0.Let{φi}i=1NΩand{ψi}i=1NΓbe two set of piecewise bilinear shape functions on Ωhand Γhrespectively. Then these sets form a basis ofVΩandVΓ. Thus, we can write the discrete solution variables asuh=∑i=1NΩuiφi≔u·φ, and similarly for the other variables. Then, the above can be written compactly in matrix form as(3.2){{Mφut+γΩMφu+Aφu−γΩBφ(u,v)u−γΓ(α1Mφψr−β1Mφφu−κ1Mφφv)=γΩa1φ,Mφvt+dΩAφv+γΩBφ(u,u)v−γΓ(α2Mφψs−β2Mφφu−κ2Mφφv)=γΩb1φ,inΩh×(0,T],{Mψrt+γΓMψr+Aψr−γΓBψ(r,s)r+γΓ(α1Mψψr−β1Mψφu−κ1Mψφv)=γΓa1ψ,Mψst+dΓAψs+γΓBψ(r,r)s+γΓ(α2Mψψs−β2Mψφu−κ2Mψφv)=γΓb1ψ,onΓh×(0,T],whereAφandMφare the stiffness and mass matrices respectively with entries(3.3)(Aφ)ij=∫Ωh∇φi·∇φjdxand(Mφ)ij=∫Ωhφiφjdx.1φis the column vector with j-th entry∫Ωhφj. Given some vectorsa,bandc,Bφ(a,b)is the matrix with entries(3.4)(Bφ)ij=∫Ωh(a·φ)(b·φ)φiφjdx.Similar quantities are defined forAψ,Mψ,1ψandBψ. The matricesMφφ,Mφψ,MψφandMψψhave entries(Mφφ)ij=∫Γhφiφjdx,(Mφψ)ij=∫Γhφiψjdx,(Mψφ)ij=∫Γhψiφjdxand(Mψψ)ij=∫Γhψiψjdx.For finite element methods involving bulk and surface coupled dynamics, it is natural to define the surface triangulation as a collection of the faces of the elements of the bulk triangulation whose vertices lie on the surface. This implies that the surface triangulation is the trace of the bulk triangulation [17]. First we approximate Ω by Ωha bulk triangulation. Next we construct Γhto be the triangulation of the surface geometry Γ by definingΓh=Ωh|∂Ωh, i.e. the vertices of Γhare the same as those lying on the surface of Ωh. In particular, then, we have∂Ωh=Γh. An example mesh is shown in Fig. 1[21]. The bulk triangulation induces the surface triangulation as illustrated. Throughout, we use hexahedral meshes for the bulk geometries which induce quadrilateral meshes for the surface geometries. For further details on techniques for generating bulk and surface triangulations with adaptivity, the reader is referred to the work of Köster et al. [17].We carry out the time-discretisation using the fractional-step θ method. This method is second order accurate when choosingθ=1−1/2and was the quickest in a selection of tested methods in a previous investigation [20]. For convergence, stability and performance of the numerical method, the reader is referred to [20]. For the time discretisation let Tmdenote the maximum time of interest, τ denote the time step and J be a fixed nonnegative integer, thenτ=TmJandtk=kτ,k=0,1,2,…,J.We denote the approximate solution at time tkbyuhk=uh(·,tk)=uk·φand similarly for the other variables. Following from (3.2), the fractional-step θ method is implemented as follows: Starting with the previous solution(un,vn,rn,sn), we first solve for the intermediate solution(un+θ,vn+θ,rn+θ,sn+θ){Mφun+θ−unθτ+Aφun+θ+γΩMφun+θ−γΓ(α1Mφψrn+θ−β1Mφφun+θ−κ1Mφφvn+θ)=γΩa1φ+γΩBφ(un,vn)un,Mφvn+θ−vnθτ+dΩAφvn+θ−γΓ(α2Mφψsn+θ−β2Mφφun+θ−κ2Mφφvn+θ)=γΩb1φ−γΩBφ(un,un)vn,Mψrn+θ−rnθτ+Aψrn+θ+γΓMψrn+θ+γΓ(α1Mψψrn+θ−β1Mψφun+θ−κ1Mψφvn+θ)=γΓa1ψ+γΓBψ(rn,sn)rn,Mψsn+θ−snθτ+dΓAψsn+θ+γΓ(α2Mψψsn+θ−β2Mψφun+θ−κ2Mψφvn+θ)=γΓb1ψ−γΓBψ(rn,rn)sn,then for the second intermediate solution(un+1−θ,vn+1−θ,rn+1−θ,sn+1−θ)we solve(3.5){Mφun+1−θ−un+θ(1−2θ)τ−γΩBφ(un+1−θ,vn+1−θ)un+1−θ=γΩa1φ−Aφun+θ−γΩMφun+θ+γΓ(α1Mφψrn+θ−β1Mφφun+θ−κ1Mφφvn+θ)Mφvn+1−θ−vn+θ(1−2θ)τ+γΩBφ(un+1−θ,un+1−θ)vn+1−θ=γΩb1φ−dΩAφvn+θ+γΓ(α2Mφψsn+θ−β2Mφφun+θ−κ2Mφφvn+θ),Mψrn+1−θ−rn+θ(1−2θ)τ−γΓBψ(rn+1−θ,sn+1−θ)rn+1−θ=γΓa1ψ−Aψrn+θ−γΓMψrn+θ−γΓ(α1Mψψrn+θ−β1Mψφun+θ−κ1Mψφvn+θ),Mψsn+1−θ−sn+θ(1−2θ)τ+γΓBψ(rn+1−θ,rn+1−θ)sn+1−θ=γΓb1ψ−dΓAψsn+θ−γΓ(α2Mψψsn+θ−β2Mψφun+θ−κ2Mψφvn+θ),and finally for the new solution(un+1,vn+1,rn+1,sn+1)we solve{Mφun+1−un+1−θθτ+Aφun+1+γΩMφun+1−γΓ(α1Mφψrn+1−β1Mφφun+1−κ1Mφφvn+1)=γΩa1φ+γΩBφ(un+1−θ,vn+1−θ)un+1−θ,Mφvn+1−vn+1−θθτ+dΩAφvn+1−γΓ(α2Mφψsn+1−β2Mφφun+1−κ2Mφφvn+1)=γΩb1φ−γΩBφ(un+1−θ,un+1−θ)vn+1−θ,Mψrn+1−rn+1−θθτ+Aψrn+1+γΓMψrn+1+γΓ(α1Mψψrn+1−β1Mψφun+1−κ1Mψφvn+1)=γΓa1ψ+γΓBψ(rn+1−θ,sn+1−θ)rn+1−θ,Mψsn+1−sn+1−θθτ+dΓAψsn+1+γΓ(α2Mψψsn+1−β2Mψφun+1−κ2Mψφvn+1)=γΓb1ψ−γΓBψ(rn+1−θ,rn+1−θ)sn+1−θ.The presence of the B matrices on the left-hand side make the system in the second step (3.5) nonlinear. The nonlinearities are solved using the iterative Newton method [20].For illustrative purposes let us take the parameter values shown in Table 1which satisfy the compatibility condition (2.13). For these parameter values the unique equilibrium state is given by(u⁎,v⁎,r⁎,s⁎)=(1,0.9,1,0.9). We stop the simulations when theL2-norm of the difference of the numerical solutions between two successive timesteps reaches some tolerance(4.1)∥uhn+1−uhn∥τ≔1τ(∫Ω(uhn+1−uhn)2)1/2≤102ε,n>0,whereεis the tolerance used for the matrix solver. Similar quantities are defined for the other variables. We note that these quantities are related to the time-derivative of the solution and therefore should become smaller as the solution does not change much in time and converges.In this section we will present numerical simulations of the coupled system of BSRDEs on three different volumes: a sphere of radius one, a cube of length one and a triaxial ellipsoid with semi-axis of lengths 1, 2 and 3. In all our simulations we fixγΩ=γΓ=500and vary the diffusion coefficients as shown in Table 2. The numbers of degrees of freedom for the sphere were 59042/3076 (bulk/surface), for the cube 71874/12292 and for the ellipsoid 59042/3076. The timestep chosen in each case wasτ=10−3.Remark 4.1In [21] we exhibited a wide variety of patterns in the bulk and on the surface of the sphere of radius 1. We will omit some of these results and refer the interested reader to see [21].Our numerical simulations reveal the following fundamental characteristics key to the theory of pattern formation:1.By takingdΩ=1in the bulk anddΓ=1on the surface, no patterns emerge (results not shown). This implies that the system fails to satisfy one of the necessary conditions for the formation of spatial structure which requires that one of the molecular species must diffuse much faster (typically the inhibitor) than the other (typically the activator), resulting in what is known as the long-range inhibition short-range activation[10,16]. This entails that both the bulk and surface dynamics are not able to generate patterns, instead the uniform steady state is the only stable solution.TakingdΩ=1in the bulk anddΓ⪢1on the surface, the bulk reaction–diffusion system is not able to generate patterns everywhere in the bulk. However, the surface reaction–diffusion system is able to form patterns on the surface as well as inducing patterning in a small band (which we can be considered as an epidermis) inside the bulk, close to the surface (see Figs. 3 and 5).On the other hand, takingdΩ⪢1in the bulk anddΓ=1on the surface, the bulk reaction–diffusion system is now able to generate patterns everywhere in the bulk including on the surface. The surface reaction–diffusion system generates patterns with small amplitudes (which seem to appear uniformly) compared to those in the bulk with large amplitudes (see Fig. 6).If we takedΩ⪢1in the bulk anddΓ⪢1on the surface, then the coupled bulk-surface reaction–diffusion system generates patterns in the interior as well as on the surface (see Figs. 7–9).The evolution of the patterning forming process is characterised by three fundamental stages as shown in Figs. 2 and 4 where we plot theL2-norms of the errors of the numerical solutions. First, an initial stage that is characterised by a rapid decay due to the smoothing effects of diffusion. If no wavenumbers are excited, the decaying convergence process persists until a uniform steady state is converged to (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, if there are some excitable wavenumbers, then a second intermediate stage emerges which is characterised by an exponential growth of the positive excitable wavenumbers to induce the formation of spatial structure. It is during this phase that the uniform steady state is driven unstable. A third and final stage is when the nonlinear terms kick-in and become dominant to act as bounds for the exponentially growing modes resulting in the formation of a spatially stable inhomogeneous state corresponding to the coupled system of BSRDEs (2.1)–(2.6) (see Fig. 4). This evolution process is valid for all parameter values capable of inducing the formation of spatial structure for reaction–diffusion type models [16].In this study we have presented the bulk-surface finite element method for solving reaction–diffusion systems posed in the interior (bulk) of three-dimensional volumes as well as on the surface enclosing the volume. In doing so, we have set up a theoretical and computational framework that allows us to model more complex and experimentally driven models coupling interior and surface dynamics. In particular, new models can be derived in developmental biology and cell motility where such processes are experimentally supported.In an earlier study [21], stability analytical theory was carried out to establish the conditions that give rise to the formation of spatial structure for such models (known as Turing diffusion-driven instability [29]) and this work supports the theoretical observations published. Our most revealing results are:•In the absence of diffusion-driven instability in the interior, the surface reaction–diffusion system is able to generate patterns on the surface as well as in a small region inside the volume. This is biologically plausible, since patterns form on the skin as well as within the epidermis region adjacent to the skin surface.In the absence of diffusion-driven instability on the surface, the bulk reaction–diffusion system has the capability to induce patterns in the interior as well as on the surface.The bulk-surface finite element method is inspired by the work of Elliott and Ranner [9] who were the first to introduce the method to study elliptic parabolic systems. For the first time, we have applied the bulk-surface finite element method to study time-dependent semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations in the form of reaction–diffusion. Within this framework, we have defined the surface triangulation as the trace of the bulk triangulation [17].A natural extension of this study involves the introduction of surface evolution to study bulk-surface reaction–diffusion systems on three-dimensional evolving volumes. There are several ways to deal with mesh movement under this framework. For example, a spring type analogy could be used to deform the bulk mesh once the surface mesh has been evolved under some mechanism. In this case, the degrees of freedom for the mesh connectivity will remain unchanged. An alternative method is to introduce mesh adaptivity. This form is harder to implement since one must introduce mesh adaptivity strategies based on a priori as well as a posteriori error estimates. These extensions form part of our current studies.
