@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We all know that there are full of uncertainty, vagueness and imprecision in real world. That is, most of the notions we are meeting in everyday life are vague rather than precise. Classical mathematical tools may not be successfully used to solve these problems, because classical mathematics requires that all mathematical concepts must be exact, otherwise precise reasoning would be impossible. In recent years, engineers and researchers have become interested in model vagueness, because many practical problems arise in such areas as economics, environmental science, engineering, medical science and social science involve data containing a wide range of uncertainties.Various types of theories such as rough set theory [20], probability theory, fuzzy set theory [22] and interval mathematics [23] are effective mathematical approaches to model vagueness, but each of these theories has its inherent limitations, which are pointed out in [12]. In 1999, soft set theory [12] was firstly proposed by Molodtsov. It is considered as a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties which is free from the inadequacy of parameter tools. In soft set theory, the problem of setting the membership function simply does not arise as in fuzzy set theory, which makes the theory convenient and easy to use in practice. Soft set theory has been proven useful in many different fields such as the smoothness of functions, probability theory, measurement theory, and operations research [12,13].In recent years, research on soft sets has been very active and many important results have been achieved in the theoretical aspect [2–4,11–14,16,19,26]. At the same time, there also have some progress concerning practical applications of soft set theory, especially the use of soft sets in decision making [1,5–10,17,18].Applications of soft sets in decision making problems have been studied by many authors in different contexts [1,5–10,17,18,27]. In [5], the authors defined soft matrix in soft sets and researched operations of soft matrix. Then a new method based on soft matrix was proposed to solve the problems of decision making. In [6], the authors applied the properties of operations of soft sets to solve the decision making problems. Maji et al. [8] first applied soft sets to solve decision making problems that is based on the concept of knowledge reduction. Chen et al. [7] presented a parameter reduction of soft sets and its applications. They pointed out that the results of reduction proposed by Maji et al. are incorrect, and the algorithm which first to compute the parameter reduction and then to compute the choice value to select the optimal objects is unreasonable. They also pointed out that the idea of attributes reduction in rough sets is quite different from the parameter reduction in soft sets. However, due to the method in [7] only based on the optimal choice object related to each object for soft set reduction, the problems of the sub-optimal choice object is not considered. Kong et al. [9] pointed out some odd situations which may occur when the method of parameter reduction in [7] is applied. Then, they proposed a method of normal parameter reduction in soft sets. With this technique, the optimal and suboptimal choice objects are still preserved. In [27], the authors proposed some improved algorithms which require relatively fewer calculations, and they also pointed out the choice value based approach and comparison score based approach are equivalent for crisp soft set based decision making problems.Ali [1] proposed a concept of soft equivalence relation, which may act as a bridge between soft sets and rough sets. He also gave a method of parameters reduction in soft sets, which is very much similar to knowledge reduction in rough sets. So we can solve the problems in soft sets with the help of rough sets.All approaches to solve decision making problems in soft sets mentioned above mainly to calculate the parameters reduction firstly, then select the optimal choice objects. And the main idea of parameters reduction is to reduce the number of parameters which have no influence to keep the optimal choice objects unchanged in soft sets.In this paper, we aim to develop a method of applying soft discernibility matrix to solve the decision making problems. The notion of soft discernibility matrix is introduced in soft sets firstly. And then a new method is proposed to solve the problems of decision making. This method can find not only the optimal choice object, but also an order relation of all objects easily by scanning the soft discernibility matrix at most one time.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some basic concepts about information systems and soft set theory are reviewed. In Section 3, the notion of soft discernibility matrix is introduced in soft sets, and some properties associated with the soft discernibility matrix are researched. At last, a new technique based on the soft discernibility matrix is proposed to solve the problems of decision making. Section 4 is devoted to weighted soft discernibility matrix with applications to decision making problems. Finally, conclusions and the future works are given in Section 5.In this section some basic notions of information systems are reviewed, which will be required in later sections. Let U be a nonempty finite set, E also a nonempty finite set and A⊆E.Definition 1([21]) The quadruple (U, A, V, f) is called an information system, or an information table, a database system, where U={x1, x2, …, xn} is a universe containing all interested objects, every xi∈U(i≤n) is called an object, A={a1, a2, …, am} is a set of attributes, each aj∈A(j≤m) is called an attribute,V=⋃j=1mVj, where Vjis the value set of the attribute ajand F={f1, f2, …, fm}, where fj:U→Vj.Definition 2([21]) R is an equivalence relation over U, the partition of U determined by indiscernibility relation R is denoted byA=U/R={[xi]R:xi∈U}where[xi]R={xj:(xi,xj)∈R}is called an equivalence class containing xi.Although rough sets and soft sets are two different mathematical tools for dealing with the model of vagueness, there are some interesting connections between them. We notice that information systems and soft sets are closely related.In this section we will review some basic concepts and properties about soft sets. Let U be a nonempty initial set of objects, E be a set of parameters in relation to objects in U, P(U) be the power set of U, and A⊆E. The definition of soft sets is given as following.Definition 3([12]) let U be a nonempty finite set and U={h1, h2, …, hm}, E be a set of parameters and E={e1, e2, …, en}. A pair (F, A) is called a soft set over U, if F is a function from a subset A of E to the power set of U. That is, a soft set is a parameterized family of subsets of U.Every soft set over U can be considered as a parameterized family of subsets of the universe U. For all e∈A, each set F(e) may be treated as the set of e-elements of the soft set (F, A), or as the set of e-approximate elements of the soft sets.Proposition 1([25]) Each soft set may be considered as an information system.If (F, E) be a soft set over the universe U′, S=(U, A, V, f) be an information system. Obviously, the universe U′ in (F, E) may be considered as the universe U, the parameters set E may be considered as the attributes set A. The information function f is defined byf(x)=1,x∈F(e)0,x∉F(e)that is, when xi∈F(ej), where xi∈U and ej∈E, then f(xi, ej)=1, otherwise f(xi, ej)=0. So we have V={0, 1}. Therefore, a soft set (F, E) may be considered as an information system S=(U, A, V{0,1}, f).As we have known that each soft set can be represented in the form of an information system, at the same time, each information system can also be converted into a soft set. Let S=(U, A, V, f) be an information system, B=⋃a∈A{a}×Vabe a set of parameters, and then a soft set (F, B) can be defined by settingF(a,v)={x∈U:a(x)=v}, wherev∈Vafor all a∈A.Definition 4([2]) If F:A→P(U×U) be a mapping from a subset of parameter A to the power set of U×U, then the soft set (F, A) over U×U is called a soft binary relation over U.Definition 5([1]) A soft binary relation (F, A) over a set U is called a soft equivalence relation over U, if F(α)≠∅ is an equivalence relation on U for all α∈A.It is well known that there exists a one-to-one relationship between the equivalence relation and partition. Therefore, a soft equivalence relation over U provides us a parameterized collection of partitions of U.Definition 6([1]) Suppose (F, A) is a soft equivalence relation over U, for each equivalence relation F(α), the notion of equivalence class over it is defined as [x]F(α)={y:(x, y)∈F(α), y∈U}.We also observe that there is an indiscernibility relation induced by the soft set (F, A) itself. This indiscernibility relation is obtained by intersection of all the equivalence relations defined by parameters. Let us sayIND(F,A)=⋂ei∈AF(ei)Suppose (F, A) is a soft set over U, where U={h1, h2, …, hm}. The partition of U determined by the indiscernibility relation IND(F, A) can be denoted by U|IND(F, A), andU|IND(F,A)={C1,C2,…,Ci}(i≤m)whereCi={[hj]IND(F,A):hj∈U}.In [1], the concept of decision parameter D=∑hijwas introduced, where hijis the value for the ith object hicorresponding to the jth parameter ej. However, it is well known that there is a straightforward relationship between the conditional parameters and the decision parameter in soft sets. Therefore, it is impossible to keep the optimal choice object unchanged by using the method of attribute reduction in rough sets. Now some basic concepts associated with the consistent decision table in soft sets, which are similar with those in decision table in rough sets will be revised.Definition 7([8]) Let (F, E) be a soft set over U, The choice value of an object hi∈U is di, given by di=∑jhij, where hijare the entries in the table of soft set.Combining this definition and the last paragraph, we know that the values of decision parameter mean the choice value of every objects. So these two terms will be used indiscriminately in the rest of this paper.Definition 8Let (F, E) be a soft set over U, A⊆E. T=(U, A=C, D) is called a consistent decision table of soft sets if and only if C⇒D, that is, IND(C)⊆IND(D), where C is the set of condition parameters, D is the decision parameter set.Definition 9([1]) Let T=(U, A, C, D) be a consistent decision table and Tγ=(U, A, C−γ, Dγ) be a decision table obtained from T by deleting some column γ from C, where Dγdenote decision parameters after delete parameters γ from C. Then γ is dispensable in T if(1)Tγis consistent, that is, C−γ⇒Dγ,IND(D)=IND(Dγ),Remark 1From the definitions above, we can see that A=C, so we will denote the consistent decision table by T=(U, C, D) in the following.Definition 10([1]) Two parameters α≠β are called equivalent classifiers if [x]α=[x]βfor all x∈U.Property 1([1]) A condition parameter γ is dispensable if and only if D and Dγare equivalent classifiers.It is well known that a decision table is consistent in soft sets if and only if C⇒D, that is, IND(C)⊆IND(D), so we can obtain the following properties.Property 2Each soft set S=(F, E) over U is consistent.ProofIt is well known that f(xi)=f(xj) for any (xi, xj)∈R, where R is an equivalence relation over U in rough sets. In [1], the concept of soft equivalence relation (F, E) over U has been defined, F(e) is an equivalence relation for any e∈E in (F, E), therefore, ⋂F(e) is also an equivalence relation, which can determine a partition. The decision parameter D=∑hijcan be calculated by the condition parameters C in soft sets. So in soft sets (F, E), the objects lie in the same equivalence classes determined by the condition parameters will also lie in the same classes of the partition which determined by the decision parameter. So we have IND(C)⊆IND(D), that is, C⇒D. Therefore, we can say that each soft set is consistent.  □Property 3Suppose (F, E) is a soft set over U, the necessary condition of IND(D)=IND(Dγ) is IND(C−γ)=IND(C), where Dγdenote decision parameter after deleting parameter γ from C.The concept of discernibility matrix was initiated by Skowron and Rauszer [15], and it has been applied to solve attribute reduction in rough sets extensively, and the advantages of it are obvious and easy to understand. Each soft set can be considered as an information system and be expressed as a Boolean-valued information system. In [1], Ali proposed the concept of soft equivalence relation in soft sets, which may act as a bridge between soft sets and rough sets. So we decide to introduce the concept of soft discernibility matrix in soft sets to solve decision making problems.In order to discuss the methods of decision making problems based on soft sets conveniently, we will introduce the following concepts.Definition 11Suppose S=(F, E) be a soft set over U. U be the set of universe, E be the set of parameters, and A⊆E. Then F is a function from U×A to V, that is, F:U×A→V such that F(hi, el)∈V, where hi∈U(i=1, 2, …, |U|), el∈A(l=1, 2, …, |A|), V={0, 1}.Definition 12(Object-based discernibility matrix) Suppose S=(F, E) be a soft set over U and A⊆E.D=(D(hi,hj))i,j≤|U|is called object-based discernibility matrix over (F, A), whereD(hi,hj)={el∈A:F(hi,el)≠F(hj,el),hi,hj∈U}is called the set of discernibility parameter between hiand hj, and F(hi, el) (F(hj, el)) is the value of objects hi(hj) associated with the parameter el.From the last section, we know that objects in the same partition class of conditional parameters determined by F will lie in the same decision class. That is, they have the same choice value. So we can reduce the scale of discernibility matrix over soft set (F, A) if we define discernibility matrix over (F, A) based on partition classes of conditional parameters determined by F.Definition 13(Partition class-based discernibility matrix) Suppose S=(F, E) be a soft set over U and A⊆E. Partition U|IND(F, A)={Ci:i≤|U|} is determined by F.D=(D(Ci,Cj))i,j≤|U|is called partition class-based discernibility matrix over (F, A), whereD(Ci,Cj)={el∈A:F(hi,el)≠F(hj,el),∀hi∈Ci,∀hj∈Cj}is called the set of discernibility parameter between Ciand Cj, and F(hi, el) is the value of objects in Ciassociated with parameter el.Unless otherwise specified, we will use partition class-based discernibility matrix in the rest of this paper.Next we will give an example to illustrate the concept of discernibility matrix over soft sets.Example 1([9]) Suppose that we have a soft set (F, E) over U with the tabular representation as in Table 1, where U={h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6}, E={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} called the set of condition parameters. And we add a decision parameter D=∑hijas the last column in Table 1, where hijare the entries in the table of soft sets. Construct its discernibility matrix according to Definition 13.For F(e1) the equivalence classes are {h1, h4, h5}, {h2, h3, h6}For F(e2) the equivalence classes are {h1, h2, h3, h4, h5}, {h6}For F(e3) the equivalence class are {h1, h2, h4, h5, h6}, {h3}For F(e4) the equivalence classes are {h1, h2, h6}, {h3, h4, h5}For F(e5) the equivalence classes are {h1, h2}, {h3, h4, h5, h6}For F(e6) the equivalence classes are {h1, h4, h5}, {h2, h3, h6}For F(e7) the equivalence classes are {h1, h4, h5, h6}, {h2, h3}.An indiscernibility relation can be obtained by intersection of all the equivalence relations induced by parameters, that isIND(F,E)=⋂ei∈EF(ei), so we can obtainIND(F,E)={(h1,h1),(h2,h2),(h3,h3),(h4,h4),(h5,h5),(h4,h5),(h5,h4),(h6,h6)}so the partition of U determined by indiscernibility relation IND(F, E) isU|IND(F,E).={{h1},{h2},{h3},{h4,h5},{h6}}.So the indiscernibility relation over (F, E) partition the set of U into five classes, that is,C1={h1};C2={h2};C3={h3};C4={h4,h5};C5={h6}Therefore, the discernibility matrix based on the Definition 13 is represented in a tabular form as shown in Table 2.It is well known that the discernibility matrix is symmetric, so we only need half of elements in the matrix. In this paper, we will represent discernibility matrix in the form of lower triangular.Soft sets is often used to solve the problems of decision making in practice. From the definition mentioned above, we can see that the discernibility matrix is defined similar as that in information system. Then can we use the discernibility matrix to solve decision making problems in soft sets? We try to find the answer to this question in the remainder of this paper.From Table 2, we still hard to solve the problem of decision making. However, we note that the object with the maximum choice value (or maximum value of decision parameter) will be selected as the optimal object. And the value of decision parameter only determined by those conditional parameters with values 1. Thus, the optimal object is the object with most conditional parameters which values are 1. But how can we choose the object with most conditional parameters which values are 1 from a given soft set? We know that the values of decision parameter only determined by the numbers of parameters with value 1 in the set of discernibility parameters for any two given objects. Thus, we only need to compare the values of decision parameter restricted within every set of discernibility matrix.In order to sufficiently utilize the discernibility matrix in soft sets to solve decision making problems, In this paper, by applying the results of paired comparison, a soft discernibility matrix is established as follows.Definition 14Let (F, E) be a soft set over U and A⊆E. Partition U|IND(F, A)={Ci:i≤|U|} is determined by F. The soft discernibility matrix is defined asD=(D(Ci,Cj))i,j≤|U|, whereD(Ci,Cj)={Ei∪Ej:i,j≤|U|.}is called the set of soft discernibility parameters between Ciand Cj. In whichEi={eli:F(hi,el)=1andF(hj,el)=0,∀hi∈Ci,∀hj∈Cj,el∈A},andEj={elj:F(hj,el)=1andF(hi,el)=0,∀hi∈Ci,∀hj∈Cj,el∈A},the symboleli(orelj) represents the objects in Ci(or Cj) have the value 1 at parameter el, that is, F(hi, el)=1, hi∈Ci(or F(hj, el)=1, hj∈Cj).From this definition, we know that Eiis a set of parameters in which objects in Ciwith value 1 and objects in Cjwith value 0. Similarly, Ejis a set of parameters in which objects in Cjwith value 1 and objects in Ciwith value 0. According to |Ei| and |Ej| in D(Ci, Cj), we can easily determine the order relation about decision between Ciand Cj.Next we will analyze again the Example 1 discussed by Kong et al. in [9], the soft discernibility matrix based on the Definition 14 can be represented in a tabular form as shown in Table 3.From the Example 1, we can obtain the partition of U determined by indiscernibility relation IND(F, E) isU|IND(F,E)={{h1},{h2},{h3},{h4,h5},{h6}}.So the indiscernibility relation over (F, E) partitions the set of U into five classes, that is,C1={h1};C2={h2};C3={h3};C4={h4,h5};C5={h6}.Here we only calculate D(C1, C2), the other sets of soft discernibility parameters can be obtained in the same way. We can see that there only one object h1∈C1, and h2∈C2, respectively. Then, from Table 2 we have D(C1, C2)={e1, e6, e7}, and from Table 1 we have F(h1, e1)=1 and F(h2, e1)=0. Therefore,E1={e11}. Moreover, F(h2, e6)=1, F(h2, e7)=1 and F(h1, e6)=0, F(h1, e7)=0. Therefore,E2={e62,e72}. So based on the Definition 14 we can obtainD(C1,C2)=E1∪E2={e11}∪{e62,e72}={e11,e62,e72}.The soft discernibility matrix based on the Definition 14 can be represented in a tabular form as in Table 3.For C4, we know that objects in C4 have the same value of decision parameter, so we can choose any one element to compare it with other classes.Property 4Let (F, E) be a soft set over U, where U={h1, h2, …, hm}. Then the soft discernibility matrixDof soft set (F, E) has the following properties:(1)D(Ci, Ci)=∅(∀i≤m);D(Ci, Cj)=D(Cj, Ci)(∀i, j≤m).But the next two items don’t hold any longer in soft discernibility matrix,(3)D(Ci, Cj)⊆D(Ci, Ck)∪D(Ck, Cj)(∀i, j, k≤m)D(Ci, Cj)∪D(Ci, Ck)−D(Ci, Cj)∩D(Ci, Ck)=D(Cj, Ck)(∀i, j, k≤m).Property 5Let (F, E) be a soft set over U, where U={h1, h2, …, hm}. If we denote d(Ci, Cj)=|D(Ci, Cj)|, where |D(Ci, Cj)| denotes the cardinality of D(Ci, Cj). Then d(Ci, Cj) has the following properties:(1)d(Ci, Ci)=0(∀i≤m);d(Ci, Cj)=d(Cj, Ci)(∀i, j≤m);Remark 2According to Definition 14 and the Property 5, we haved(Ci,Cj)=|D(Ci,Cj)|=|Ei∪Ej|,it is obviously that Ei∩Ej=∅, sod(Ci,Cj)=|D(Ci,Cj)|=|Ei|+|Ej|.Moreover, d(Ci, Cj) also has the following special properties for the soft discernibility matrix of soft sets.Property 6If d(Ci, Cj)=2n+1(n∈N+) in soft discernibility matrixD, where N+denote the positive integer, then we have |Ei|≠|Ej|.Remark 3|Ei|≠|Ej|, that is, either |Ei|>|Ej| or |Ei|<|Ej|. It is to say that there is an order relation between Ciand Cj. In other words, we can say that either Ciis superior to Cjor Cjis superior to Ciin the sense of decision making.Property 7If d(Ci, Cj)=2n(n∈N+) in soft discernibility matrixD, where N+denote the positive integer. And if |Ei|=|Ej|, then Ciand Cjare kept in the same decision class. If |Ei|≠|Ej|, then there must exists an order relation between Ciand Cj.For the example presented by Maji et al.[8], we notice that the parameters with value 0 or 1 to all objects do not appear in our soft discernibility matrix. According to Definition 14, we can conclude that some parameters will be deleted unwittingly when we solve the problems of decision making with the help of soft discernibility matrix. Thus some parameters which have no influence on final decision will be deleted by constructing soft discernibility matrix for a soft set.In what follows, we will consider the example presented by Ma et al. [10] to explain the result we mentioned above.Example 2([10]) Suppose that (F, E) is a soft set over U, whereU={h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,h7,h8},E={e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6,e7,e8,e9,e10,e11,e12,e13,e14,e15,e16},the tabular form of soft set (F, E) is given in Table 4.With the help of Definition 14, we can construct the soft discernibility matrix of Table 4as in Example 1. It can be represented as shown below in Table 5.In [10], we have known that the set of the optimal normal parameter reduction is {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e11, e12, e14, e16}, that is, the subset of parameters {e7, e8, e9, e10, e13, e15} be deleted. It is obvious that all the objects of U have the value 0 and 1 at the parameters e13, e15, respectively, so these two parameters won’t appear in any set of discernibility parameters. Thus deleting these two parameters will have no influence on final decision, and according to Property 1, these two condition parameters are dispensable. Obviously, after the soft discernibility matrix be constructed, we can see that the obvious dispensable parameters e13 and e15 do not appear in our soft discernibility matrix.Most existing approaches to solve decision making problems based on soft sets are mainly to find a reduction of parameters for soft sets firstly, then select the optimal choice objects according to the values of decision parameter. But in this paper, we needn’t to find a parameters reduction for given soft sets, and solve the problems of decision making immediately according to the constructed soft discernibility matrix.As pointed out in [1], actually we are interested in study of classification ability of the decision parameter D=∑hijrather than its values. While classification ability of decision parameter can only be determined by the parameters value in the set of soft discernibility parameters. Thus we only need to compare the values of decision parameter restricted within every set of soft discernibility parameters.For a given soft set (F, E) over U, and any two classes Ciand Cjfrom the partition of U determined by F, we note that the values of decision parameter only determined by those parameters with value 1 in D(Ci, Cj). Thus, by applying the results of paired comparison, an order relation can be easily obtained from the soft discernibility matrix, which can not only provide us the optimal object but also the suboptimal object.According to the discussions above, an novel algorithm for solve the problems of decision making will be given as following:Algorithm 1Decision making based on soft discernibility matrix.Input:A soft set S=(F, E) over U, where U={h1, h2, …, hm}.The order relation of all the objects.Compute the partition of U and the soft discernibility matrixD=D(Ci,Cj)i,j≤m.Denote D1={D(Ci, Cj):d(Ci, Cj)=2n, n∈N+} and D2={D(Ci, Cj):d(Ci, Cj)=2n+1, n∈N+}. Select the items D1 and D2 from the soft discernibility matrix, respectively.For every element of D1, we need to compare its |Ei| with |Ej| according to Property 7. If |Ei|=|Ej|, then the objects hi∈Ciand hj∈Cjare kept in the same decision class. Otherwise, there must exists an order relation between the objects hiand hj, that is, either hiis superior to hj, or the objects hjis superior to hi.Output the result of the step 3. If it is a global order relation for all of the objects in U, then the algorithm is end; otherwise, turn to step 5.Combine with the result of step 4, find the corresponding elements in D2 to compare the order relation based on the Property 6. For the objects which lie in the same decision classes after the step 4, when compare them with the other objects, it only need to select one of them. And the selected objects must have the minimal cardinality in the set of soft discernibility parameters.Output the order relation among all the objects by combining the forth step with the fifth step.We will continue to use the Example 1 to illustrate the algorithm for determine the order relation among all the objects in soft sets.Example 3Given a soft set as in Table 1, determine the order relation among all the objects in this soft set using Algorithm 1.From Table 1, we can obtain the partition of U is{{h1},{h2},{h3},{h4,h5},{h6}}we will denote {h1} by C1, {h2} by C2, {h3} by C3, {h4, h5} by C4, {h6} by C5, and the constructed soft discernibility matrix is as Table 3.From Table 3, we haveD1={D(C3,C1),D(C4,C1),D(C4,C3),D(C5,C1),D(C5,C3),D(C5,C4)}D2={D(C2,C1),D(C3,C2),D(C4,C2),D(C5,C2)}According to Definition 14, in D1, we note that |E3|=|E4| in D(C4, C3), and |E1|=|E5| in D(C5, C1), respectively. So the objects in C3 and C4 are kept in the same decision class, that is, h3, h4 and h5 are kept in the same decision class, in other words, h3, h4 and h5 have the same choice value. Similarly, the objects in C1 and C5 are in the same decision class, that is, h1 and h6 have the same choice value. Since |E1|>|E3| in D(C3, C1), the objects in C1 are superior to C3, that is, h1 is superior to h3.Combine the above results, we have {h1, h6}≻{h3, h4, h5}.Next we only need to analyze the relation between h2 and {h1, h6}, or h2 and {h3, h4, h5}.In D2, we note that |E2|>|E1| in D(C2, C1), so C2 is superior to C1, that is, h2 is superior to h1, because h1 and h6 are in the same decision class, so h2≻{h1, h6}.Combine the results of steps 4 and 5, we have h2≻{h1, h6}≻{h3, h4, h5}, so an order relation among all the objects is obtained. And the optimal object is h2.Sometimes, we not only need the optimal object but also the suboptimal object. This technique can help us obtain an order relation among all the objects.In [24], Lin asked a very fundamental question: should a membership function be regarded as the only characteristic function of a fuzzy set? While answering this question by himself in [24], Lin defined a new theory of mathematical analysis which is “theory of W-soft sets”, that is, weighted soft sets. Following this style, Maji et al. [8] defined the weighted table of a soft set. A weighted table of a soft set will have entriesdij=wij×hij, instead of 0 and 1 only, where hijare the entries in the table of the soft set andwijare the weights of the parameter ej. The weighted choice value of an object is defined as following:Definition 15([8]) The choice value of an object hi∈U is ci, given by ci=∑jdij, wheredij=wij×hij.The flexible decision making schemes established in the preceding section can now be easily extended to deal with the problems where each of the parameters has an important weight. In response to this new framework, weighted choice values should be used to substitute for ordinary choice values in the process of decision making. In this paper, we will use weighted soft discernibility matrix to address decision making problems.When the weights are imposed on the soft discernibility matrix defined by the Definition 14, a weighted soft discernibility matrix is obtained. And elements of weighted soft discernibility matrix can be denoted byD(Ci,Cj)={Ei∪Ej:i,j≤|U|.},whereEi={eli*ωi∈A:F(hi,el)=1andF(hj,el)=0,hi∈Ci,hj∈Cj},and F(hi, el) denote the value of objects in Ciassociated with el, andeli*widenote the parameters with the weightwifor the objects in Ci.Now a new algorithm of decision making problems based on weighted soft discernibility matrix is given as following.Algorithm 2Decision making based on weighted soft discernibility matrix.Input:The soft set S=(F, E) over U, where U={h1, h2, …, hm}, and the set of weightsW={wi:i=1,2,…,|E|}The order relation of all the objects.Compute the partition of U and the soft discernibility matrixD=D(Ci,Cj)i,j≤m.Input the weights of parameters into the soft discernibility matrix.Compare the weighted choice value of D(Ci, Cj) in the similar way as in Algorithm 1, that is compare |Ei|×ωiwith |Ej|×ωj, wherewi,wjdenote the weights, respectively.Output the order relation among all the objects.For the soft set in Example 1, suppose that, Mr. X is interested in buying a house on the basis of his choice parameters with the weight choice that given by the decision maker. That means, out of available houses in U, he selects the house which qualifies with all of the conditions that he likes. Suppose the weights of every parameters are as following:ω1=0.8,ω2=0.7,ω3=0.5,ω4=0.4,ω5=0.3,ω6=0.2,ω7=0.2.By imposing weights on his choice parameters, Mr. X could use the above revised algorithm to obtain his final decision. Then we have a weighted soft discernibility matrix with the tabular representation show as Table 6.From Table 6, we know that in D(C2, C1), |E1|=|{e1}|×0.8=0.8 and |E2|=|{e6}|×0.2+|{e7}|×0.2=0.4, thus we find that C1 is superior to C2, that is, h1 is superior to h2. In the same way, we can obtain the order relation among all the objects is h1≻h6≻h2≻h4, h5≻h3. Therefore, the optimal choice objects is h1. This means that the optimal object and the order relation among the objects are all changed after imposing weights on his choice parameters. In practice, when we face one problem, different people will have different opinions. So this method of imposing weights on choice parameters based on preferences of people will be useful to solve the problems in real life.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In recent years, there has some progress associated with practical applications of soft set theory, especially the use of soft sets in decision making. In this paper, the notion of soft discernibility matrix is firstly introduced in soft sets, and a new technique is proposed to solve the problems of decision making based on soft discernibility matrix. The algorithm can output an order relation of all the objects easily by scanning the soft discernibility matrix at most one time. At last, the weighted soft discernibility matrix is introduced and its application to decision making problems is also investigated.In our future works, we will intend to employ this method to the reduction of parameters, that is, search the minimal subset of E to keep the order of decision unchanged.
