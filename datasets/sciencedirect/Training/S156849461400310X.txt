@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This research addresses system reliability analysis using weakest t-norm based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations, where failure probabilities of all components are represented by different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Due to the incomplete, imprecise, vague and conflicting information about the component of system, the present study evaluates the reliability of system in terms of membership function and non-membership function by using weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations on different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In general, interval arithmetic (α-cut arithmetic) operations have been used to analyze the fuzzy system reliability. In complicated systems, interval arithmetic operations may occur the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness. In order to overcome the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness, this research adopts approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations under the weakest t-norm arithmetic operations (Tw) to analyze fuzzy system reliability. The approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations employ principle of interval arithmetic under the weakest t-norm arithmetic operations. The proposed novel fuzzy arithmetic operations may obtain fitter decision values, which have smaller fuzziness accumulating and successfully analyze the system reliability. Also weakest t-norm arithmetic operations provide more exact fuzzy results and effectively reduce fuzzy spreads (fuzzy intervals). Using proposed approach, fuzzy reliability of series system and parallel system are also constructed. For numerical verification of proposed approach, a malfunction of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is presented as a numerical example. The result of the proposed method is compared with the listing approaches of reliability analysis methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Reliable engineering is one of the important engineering tasks in design and development of any technical system. The conventional reliability of a system is defined as the probability that the system performs its assigned function properly during a predefined period under the condition that the system behavior can be fully characterized in the context of probability measures. However, in the real world problems, the collected data or system parameters are often fuzzy/imprecise because of incomplete or non-obtainable information, and the probabilistic approach to the conventional reliability analysis is inadequate to account for such built-in uncertainties in data. To overcome this problem, fuzzy set theory [1] has been used in the evaluation of the reliability of a system. From a long period of time, efforts have been made in the design and development of reliable large-scale systems. In that period of time, considerable work has been done by researchers to build a systematic theory of reliability based on the probability theory. In a general sense, fuzzy reliability can be physically interpreted as the probability that no substantial performance deterioration occurs in a predetermined time interval [2].In the work of Cai et al. [3], the fuzzy system reliability was established based on the binary state assumption and possibility assumption. However in the work of Cai et al. [4], the fuzzy system reliability was established based on the three-state assumption and possibility assumption. In the work of Cai et al. [5], the fuzzy system reliability was developed based on the basis of fuzzy state assumption and probability assumption. They presented a fuzzy set based approach to failure rate and reliability analysis, where profust failure rate is defined in the context of statistics. Cai et al. [6] also discussed the system reliability for coherent system based on the fuzzy state assumption and probability assumption.Singer [7] used a fuzzy set approach for fault tree and reliability analysis in which the relative frequencies of the basic events are considered as fuzzy numbers. Cheng and Mon [8] analyzed fuzzy system reliability analysis by use of interval of confidence. Through theoretical analysis and computational results, they have shown that their proposed approach is more general and straightforward compared to Singer [7].Huang et al. [9] proposed a fault-tree analysis based on posbist reliability theory. This method has the advantages of evaluating the probability of failure in a system when historical data are scarce or the failure probability is extremely small. Chen [10] presented a new method for fuzzy system reliability analysis using fuzzy number arithmetic operations in which reliability of each component is considered as fuzzy number and used simplified fuzzy arithmetic operations rather than complicated interval fuzzy arithmetic operations of fuzzy numbers [8] or the complicated extended algebraic fuzzy numbers [7]. However, the result of evaluating fuzzy system reliability in [7,8,10] are approximated values. It is also noted that in [11], Mon and Cheng addressed an approach for system reliability having components of different failure distribution. They also used α-cut and interval arithmetic operations. In all papers mentioned above, sup-min convolution has been basically used for fuzzy arithmetic operations to evaluate fuzzy system reliability. Hong and Do [12] used Tw(the weakest t-norm) instead of ‘min’ for fuzzy arithmetic operations based on the sup-t-norm convolution where the reliability of each system component is represented by L–R type fuzzy number.Fuzzy set theory has been shown to be a useful tool to handle such situations by attributing a degree to which a certain object belongs to a set. In real life, a person may assume that an object belongs to a set to a certain degree, but it is possible that he is not so sure about it. In other words, there may be a hesitation or uncertainty about the membership degree of x in A. In fuzzy set theory, there is no means to incorporate that hesitation in the membership degrees. A possible solution was to use intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS), defined by Atanassov [13].The concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) can be viewed as an alternative approach to define a fuzzy set in cases where available information is not sufficient for the definition of an imprecise concept by means of a conventional fuzzy set. In fuzzy set, the degree of acceptance is considered only but IFS is characterized by a membership function (acceptance) and a non-membership function (rejection) so that the sum of both values is less than one [14]. In fact, Biswas [15] pointed out that there were situations where IFS theory is more appropriate to deal. Bustince and Burillo [16] proposed that the concept of vague sets coincides with that of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Therefore, it is expected that intuitionistic fuzzy sets could be used to simulate any activities and processes requiring human expertise and knowledge, which are inevitably imprecise or not totally reliable. IFS theory has been applied in different areas such as logic programming [17,18], decision-making problems [19,20], in medical diagnosis [21], and pattern recognitions [22]. Chen [23] presented a method for analyzing the fuzzy system reliability based on triangular vague sets. Shu et al. [24] proposed a method for the failure analysis problem of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) to compute the intuitionistic fuzzy fault-tree interval, traditional reliability, and the intuitionistic fuzzy reliability interval. Chang et al. [25] proposed a vague fault-tree analysis procedure to determine the weapon system's reliability. Cheng et al. [26] proposed an intuitionistic fault-tree analysis procedure to determine the intuitionistic fuzzy reliability interval for liquefied natural gas terminal emergency shutdown system. Their approach integrated experts’ knowledge and experience in terms of providing the possibility of failure of bottom events, and used a triangular intuitionistic fuzzy set to perform the calculation. Kumar et al. [27] extended the concept of fuzzy set by idea of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy set and proposed a general procedure to construct the membership function and non-membership function of the reliability function using intuitionistic fuzzy failure rate. Here the failure rate of the system is represented by a triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number. Lin et al. [28] proposed approximated fuzzy arithmetic operations based on weakest t-norm to evaluate repairable reliability. Chang and Cheng [29] proposed a general approach to evaluating the PCBA for components with different membership functions and obtained fault interval and reliability interval of system using α-cut of vague set and interval arithmetic operations of vague sets.In this paper, the concept of fuzzy number is extended by the idea of intuitionistic fuzzy number and weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations are proposed to calculate fault interval and reliability interval of a system, where failure probabilities of all components are represented by different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Since weakest t-norm (Tw) based arithmetic give a smaller fuzziness in reliability. So using proposed approach, it has been shown that length of reliability interval (uncertainty about the reliability) decreases i.e. smaller fuzzy spread may obtain and obtained results are more confident. For numerical verification, a malfunction of PCBA [29] is presented as a numerical example.The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section “Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory”, we give the review of basic concepts related to intuitionistic fuzzy sets and its operations. Weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations on different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced in Section “Weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations on different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers”. In Section “Fuzzy system reliability analysis using approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations”, novel approach has been developed for the fuzzy reliability analysis of series system and parallel system using weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations where the reliabilities of components of the system are represented by different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Section “Proposed approach” proposes a novel approach to calculate fault interval and reliability interval of PCBA. In Section “Numerical verification and comparison”, PCBA is used to illustrate the proposed approach and some comparisons are discussed. The final section makes conclusions.Fuzzy set theory was first introduced by Zadeh [30]. The membership function of a classical fuzzy set assigns a number from the unit interval to each element of the universe of discourse to indicate the degree of belongingness to the set under consideration. Let X be the universe of discourse defined byX={x1,x2,...,xn}. The grade of membership in a fuzzy set defined on X indicates the evidence forxi∈Xbut does not indicate the evidence againstxi∈X.Atanassov [13] introduced the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy set which is characterized by a membership functionμA˜i(x)indicating evidence forx∈Xand a non-membership functionνA˜i(x)indicating the evidence againstx∈X. This idea which is a natural generalization of usual fuzzy set seems to be useful in modeling many real life situations.Let X be a universe of discourse. Then an intuitionistic fuzzy setA˜iin X is a set of ordered triples given byA˜i={<x,μA˜i(x),νA˜i(x)>:x∈X},whereμA˜i:X→[0,1]andνA˜i:X→[0,1]are functions such that0≤μA˜i(x)+νA˜i(x)≤1∀x∈X.For eachx∈X, the numbersμA˜i(x)andνA˜i(x)represent respectively the degree of membership and degree of non-membership of the elementx∈XtoA˜i⊆X.For eachx∈X, the intuitionistic fuzzy index of x inA˜iis defined asπA˜i(x)=1−μA˜i(x)−νA˜i(x).An IFSA˜iin the universe of discourse X is convex [31,32] if and only if(i)Membership functionμA˜i(x)ofA˜iis fuzzy-convex i.e.Non-membership functionνA˜i(x)ofA˜iis fuzzy-concave i.e.An IFSA˜iin the universe of discourse X is normal [31,32] if there exits at least two pointsx1,x2∈Xsuch thatμA˜i(x1)=1andνA˜i(x2)=1.An intuitionistic fuzzy subsetA˜i={<x,μA˜i(x),νA˜i(x)>:x∈R}of the real line R is called an intuitionistic fuzzy number if(i)A˜iis convex and normal.μA˜iis upper semi continuous andνA˜iis lower semi continuous.SuppA˜i={x∈X:νA˜i(x)<1}is bounded.Consider an IFNA˜iwith membership functionμA˜i(x)and non-membership functionνA˜i(x)as given belowμA˜i(x)=Lx−a1a2−a1,a1≤x≤a21,a2≤x≤a3Ra4−xa4−a3,a3≤x≤a40,otherwiseandνA˜i(x)=L′a′2−xa′2−a′1,a′1≤x≤a′20,a′2≤x≤a′3R′x−a′3a′4−a′3,a′3≤x≤a′41,otherwisewherea1,a2,a3,a4,a′1,a′2,a′3,a′4∈Rsuch thata′1≤a1≤a′2≤a2≤a3≤a′3≤a4≤a′4,L and R respectively denote the left and right shape functions ofμA˜i(x).Also L′ and R′ respectively denote the left and right shape functions ofνA˜i(x).In this section, weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations on different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced. Lin [28] developed the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operators with the weakest t-norm arithmetic. In this paper, approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations with weakest t-norm (Tw) are developed on different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to calculate fault interval and reliability interval of system. The Tw-based operations can get more exact performance, which means smaller fuzzy spreads, under uncertain environment [12]. This exact performance may successfully reduce accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness in complexity fuzzy systems.LetA˜iandB˜iare two IFNs (not necessarily with the same shape) on R and Twbe the weakest t-norm.Atanassov [14] has defined two kinds of cuts for IFS. NamelyFor membership function, α-cut ofA˜iis defined as(1a)A˜αi={x:μA˜i(x)≥α,α∈[0,1]}For non-membership function, β-cut ofA˜iis defined as(1b)A˜βi={x:νA˜i(x)≤β,β∈[0,1]}Note thatA˜αiandA˜βiboth are crisp sets.Suppose thatA˜iis an IFN. Then fuzzy-convexity of the membership function of IFN implies(2a)A˜αi=[a1α,a2α],∀α∈(0,1]Also fuzzy-concavity of the non-membership function of IFN implies(2b)A˜βi=[a1β,a2β],∀β∈[0,1)wherea1α(a2α)anda2β(a1β)will be an increasing(decreasing) function of α and β respectively withα,β∈[0,1].Similarly for IFNB˜i,(3a)B˜αi=[b1α,b2α],∀α∈(0,1](3b)B˜βi=[b1β,b2β],∀β∈[0,1)whereb1α(b2α)andb2β(b1β)will be an increasing(decreasing) function of α and β respectively withα,β∈[0,1].According to Kandel [33], the fuzzy number may be decomposed into their cuts. So, generalizing this concept for IFNA˜iwith membership functionμA˜iand non-membership functionνA˜iwhich are defined as follows:(4)μA˜i=∑ααA˜αi,νA˜i=∑ββA˜βiThe study will show the weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations onA˜iandB˜iand then give a numerical example as the following:(1) Addition:(5a)(A˜i⊕TwB˜i)α=[a1(α=1)+b1(α=1)−max(a1(α=1)−a1α,b1(α=1)−b1α),a2(α=1)+b2(α=1)+max(a2α−a2(α=1),b2α−b2(α=1))](5b)(A˜i⊕TwB˜i)β=[a1(β=0)+b1(β=0)−max(a1(β=0)−a1β,b1(β=0)−b1β),a2(β=0)+b2(β=0)+max(a2β−a2(β=0),b2β−b2(β=0))](2) Subtraction(6a)(A˜iθTwB˜i)α=[a1(α=1)−b1(α=1)−max(a1(α=1)−a1α,b2α−b2(α=1)),a2(α=0)−b2(α=0)+max(a2α−a2(α=0),b1(α=0)−b1α)](6b)A˜iθTwB˜iβ=a1β=0−b1β=0−maxa1β=0−a1β,b2β−b2β=0,a2(β=0)−b2(β=0)+maxa2β−a2(β=0),b1(β=0)−b1β(3) Multiplication:(7a)(A˜i⊗TwB˜i)α=[a1(α=1)⋅b1(α=1)−max((a1(α=1)−a1α)b1(α=1),(b1(α=1)−b1α)a1(α=1)),a2(α=1)⋅b2(α=1)+max((a2α−a2(α=1))b2(α=1),(b2α−b2(α=1))a2(α=1))](7b)(A˜i⊗TwB˜i)β=[a1(β=0)⋅b1(β=0)−max((a1(β=0)−a1β)b1(β=0),(b1(β=0)−b1β)a1(β=0)),a2(β=0).b2(β=0)+max((a2β−a2(β=0))b2(β=0),(b2β−b2(β=0))a2(β=0))](4) Division:(8a)(A˜i∅TwB˜i)α=[(a1(α=1)/b2(α=1)−max((a1(α=1)−a1α)/b2(α=1),(1/b2(α=1)−1/b2α)a1(α=1)),a2(α=1)/b1(α=1)+max((a2α−a2(α=1))/b1(α=1),(1/b1α−1/b1(α=1))a2(α=1))](8b)(A˜i∅TwB˜i)β=[a1(β=0)/b2(β=0)−max(a1(β=0)−a1β)/b2(β=0),(1/b2(β=0)−1/b2β)a1(β=0)),a2(β=0)/b1(β=0)+max((a2β−a2(β=0))/b1(β=0),(1/b1β−1/b1(β=0))a2(β=0))]For example, letA˜ibe triangular type IFN with membership functionμA˜i(x)and non-membership functionνA˜i(x)andB˜ibe an IFN of sharp gamma type with membership functionμB˜i(x)and non-membership functionνB˜i(x)(Fig. 1).(9)μA˜i(x)=0,x<7,(x−7)/2,7≤x≤9,(11−x)/2,9≤x≤11,0,x>11,νA˜i(x)=1,x<6,(9−x)/36≤x≤9,(x−9)/39≤x≤12,1,x>12,(10)μB˜i(x)=exp(−7(x−3)2),2≤x≤4,νB˜i(x)=1−exp(−1.5(x−3)2),1≤x≤5,Firstly, α-cuts and β-cuts ofA˜iandB˜iare computed as listed in Table 1, whereα,β∈[0,1].According to Table 1 results, we get the result of fuzzy operations based on interval arithmetic operations and Eqs. (5)–(8) as are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows that the results of fuzzy operations obtain a larger fuzzy spread with interval arithmetic and a smaller fuzzy spread with approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations. Among these, we can observe that multiplication operation has a larger effect for fuzzy spread.In this section, a new method has been developed for the fuzzy reliability analysis of series system and parallel system using weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations where the reliabilities of components of the system are represented by different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.Let us consider a series system consisting of ‘n’ components as shown in Fig. 3. LetR˜jibe the intuitionistic fuzzy reliability (IFR) of the jth component, j=1, 2, …, n and Twbe the weakest t-norm. Then the IFRR˜Siof the series system can be evaluated as follows:R˜Si=R˜1i⊗TwR˜2i⊗Tw⋯⊗TwR˜niFor membership function, α-cut ofR˜jiis(11a)R˜jαi=rjαL,rjαR,∀α∈(0,1],j=1,2,...,n.For non-membership function, β-cut ofR˜jiis(11b)R˜jβi=rjβL,rjβR,∀β∈[0,1),j=1,2,...,n.Then based on Eq. Eq. (11) and approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations (Eqs. (5)–(8)), we can evaluate α-cut and β-cut for system reliabilityR˜Sishown as following:For membership function, α-cut ofR˜Siis(12a)R˜Sαi=R˜1αi⊗TwR˜2αi⊗Tw...⊗TwR˜nαi=∏j=1nrj(α=1)L−max1≤j≤nrj(α=1)L−rjαL∏k=1k≠jnrk(α=1)L,∏j=1nrj(α=1)R+max1≤j≤n(rjαR−rj(α=1)R)∏k=1k≠jnrk(α=1)RFor non-membership function, β-cut ofR˜Siis(12b)R˜Sβi=R˜1βi⊗TwR˜2βi⊗Tw...⊗TwR˜nβi=∏j=1nrj(β=0)L−max1≤j≤n(rj(β=0)L−rjβL)∏k=1k≠jnrk(β=0)L,∏j=1nrj(β=0)R+max1≤j≤nrjβR−rj(β=0)R∏k=1k≠jnrk(β=0)RSystem reliabilityR˜Siis an IFN with membership functionμR˜Siand non-membership functionνR˜Sidefined as follows:μR˜Si=∑ααR˜Sαi,νR˜Si=∑ββR˜SβiLet us consider a parallel system consisting of ‘n’ components as shown in Fig. 4. LetR˜jibe the IFR of the jth component, j=1, 2, …, n. Then the IFRR˜Piof the parallel system can be evaluated as follows:R˜Pi=1θTw[(1θTwR˜1i)⊗Tw(1θTwR˜2i)⊗Tw⋯⊗Tw(1θTwR˜ni)]Then based on Eq. Eq. (11) and approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations (Eqs.

[9] proposed a fault-tree analysis based on posbist reliability theory. This method has the advantages of evaluating the probability of failure in a system when historical data are scarce or the failure probability is extremely small. However, this method selects the maximal failure probability of the bottom event and may obtain a biased conclusion. Chang et al. [25] proposed a vague fault-tree analyis procedure to determine a weapon system's reliability. This method has the advantages of modeling and analyzing vague system reliability in a more flexible and more intelligent manner. However, Chang et al.’s method is only applicable when bottom event is represented by triangle vague set. Therefore, to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, Chang and Cheng [29] proposed a general approach to evaluate fault interval and reliability interval of the PCBA for components with different membership functions using α-cut of vague set and interval arithmetic operations of vague sets. In general, interval arithmetic (α-cut arithmetic) operations have been used to analyze the fuzzy system reliability. In complicated systems, interval arithmetic operations may occur the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness. In order to overcome the accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness, this research adopts approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations under the weakest t-norm arithmetic operations (Tw) to evaluate fault interval and reliability interval of system.The numerical procedure is calculated and listed as follows:Step 1. Construct a fault-tree logic diagramTo construct fault-tree diagram by fault-tree logical symbols and tracing back whole process from top to bottom events (as Fig. 5).Step 2. Determine possible failure distribution of bottom eventPossible failure distributions of bottom events are determine by aggregating experts knowledge and experience.Step 3. Derive the solution modelThe solution model is derived as shown in Eq. (14).Step 4. Compute membership interval of confidence and non-membership interval of confidence forα,β=0,0.1,...,1.Membership interval of confidence (α-cuts) and non-membership interval of confidence (β-cuts) for elementary events A1, A2, A3, …, S are computed forα,β=0,0.1,...,1as listed in Tables 5 and 6.Step 5. Calculate failure probability of top event using weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operationsBased on solution model, α-cuts and β-cuts of possible failure distributions of elementary events A1, A2, A3, …, S, whereα,β=0,0.1,...,1,this step calculate α-cuts (membership interval of confidence) and β-cuts (non-membership interval of confidence) for failure probability of top failure event “PCBA Fault” using weakest t-norm (Tw) based approximate intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations introduced in Eqs. (5)–(8).Step 6. Calculate failure probability and reliability of top event with different fuzzy arithmeticFuzzy failure probability of top event “PCBA fault” with different fuzzy arithmetic is calculated forα,β=0,0.1,...,1as shown in Table 7.Step 7. Calculate fuzzy spreads for failure probability of top event with different fuzzy arithmeticFuzzy spreads for failure probability of “PCBA Fault” with different fuzzy arithmetic are calculated forα,β=0,0.1,...,1as shown in Table 8.In this section, example of a PCBA is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. Also, the results obtained using proposed approach are compared with the experimental results obtained using the traditional probability reliability, Huang et al.’s [9], Chang et al.’s [25] and Chang et al. (interval arithmetic) [29] methods. The fault tree for ‘PCBA fault’ is shown in Fig. 5 and case data from the mid-sized manufacturing factory located in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan [24]. This research uses the malfunction of PCBA as fault tree top event. Fault tree for “PCBA fault” is constructed by fault-tree logical symbols and trace back the entire process from top to bottom events. The descriptions of sub-events and bottom events are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Due to incomplete failure data of system elementary event and different fault probability density function, this research proposed speculation by experts’ opinions according to incomplete information condition. It reasonably gives different fault membership function of possibility of failure distribution under different set bottom event. This research uses logical node to describe “AND” gate with the sign of ∩, and “OR” gate with the sign of ∪. It can represent their relationship of parallel and series as (see Fig. 6). For example the fault event “IC lead bend (A)” is the union of event A1, A2, and A3 (i.e., “Insufficient IQC sampling”, “Mixed up failure ICs from vendors”, and “Bad handling operation”).PCBAFault=I∪II∪III∪IV∪Vwhere ∩ means relation of parallel and ∪ means series.Let qirepresent the failure possibility of bottom event i, then the top event possibility of “PCBA Fault” can be described as(14)qPCBA=1−(1−qI)(1−qII)(1−qIII)(1−qIV)(1−qV)The failure possibility for each bottom event is logically given based on expert's opinions. Assuming the following different types of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to represent the failure possibilities for bottom events of fault tree from expert's knowledge and experience as follows:Bottom
