@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes eight groups of twenty nine scoring criteria that can help designers and practitioners to compare and select an appropriate methodology for a certain problem in designing product service system (PSS). PSS has been researched for more than a decade and is now becoming more and more popular in academia as well as industry. Despite that fact, the adoption of PSS is still limited for its potential. One of the main reasons is that designing PSS itself is a challenge. Designers and developers face difficulties in choosing appropriate PSS design methodologies for their projects so that they can design effective PSS offerings. By proposing eight groups of twenty nine scoring criteria, this paper enables a “step by step” process to identify the most appropriate design methodology for a company’s PSS problem. An example is also introduced to illustrate the use of the proposed scoring criteria and provide a clear picture of how different design methodologies can be utilized at their best in terms of application.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Product service system (PSS) forms a special case in servitization [36] where a company provides its customers with an offering including physical product and non-physical service. This new concept of providing PSS offering is different from selling product only which is becoming more and more difficult to compete, especially in today’s scenario of economic crisis, growing environmental issues and diversified customer demands [37,5,36]. As mentioned in literature, the introduction of PSS can help companies to enhance competitiveness, achieve social, environmental, and economic goals, as well as attract and retain customers [7,28,27,8].Formally, PSS is defined by many authors, including Goedkoop et al. [10]. In this work, PSS was defined as “a marketable set of products and services capable of jointly fulfilling a user’s needs. The product/service ratio in this set can vary, either in terms of function fulfillment or economic value”. This definition makes the concept of PSS close to functional economy [22] where customers pay for the “function” or the “use” of the solutions, not for the physical products. PSS concept also matches with the thinking of “hiring products to get jobs done” which was mentioned by Bettencourt and Ulwick [7] and was further discussed by Lim et al. [17] and Hussain et al. [12].Some researchers suggested that PSS could be considered as an integrated system which consists of products, services, and the infrastructure to deliver a solution to a customer to satisfy certain needs [28,27,36]. An example of PSS is the “document management solution” which is discussed in the work of Baines et al. [6]. Conventionally, a customer would buy a physical product which is a photocopier. With the “PSS model”, the customer will only “buy” the capability of document management and leave the rest of the work (refill, maintenance, replace parts, etc.) to the manufacturer.Early works on PSS related topics were carried out more than a decade ago with pioneer researchers such as: Goedkoop et al. [10], Mont [22] and Morelli [24]. As summarized by Vasantha et al. [36], research on PSS has ranged from the definition of PSS elements, generation of PSS offerings, representation of PSS, etc. to the evaluation of PSS offerings, sustainable development, design process for integrating products and services etc.Tukker [34] classified PSS into 3 types as follows:•Product oriented PSS: Company sells a product with additional services to ensure the working condition of the product. The ownership of the product is transferred to the customer. Services such as: maintenance, repair, recycling, refilling, etc. could be classified into this type.Use oriented PSS: Company sells the use or availability of a product not owned by the customer. Examples of this type are product leasing or sharing.Result oriented PSS: Company sells a result or capability of a product not owned by the customer. For example, instead of selling paint to a customer, the company can sell the result, a painted house.Surveys by Baines et al. [6] and Beuren et al. [8] showed the benefits of PSS to the consumer, provider, environment and society. These benefits result from the higher level of satisfaction, increased competitiveness, decreased environmental impact and materials savings. The main benefit of PSS for the company is that it pushes for continuous business improvement, quality improvement, and better company–customer relationship.Table 1, which is adapted from Beuren et al. [8], shows how the PSS benefits the consumer, provider, environment and society. In this sense, PSS is closely related to sustainable development and green technology.Although PSS brings plenty of benefits, it is still adopted limitedly in the industry for its potentials. The major challenges in adopting PSS were suggested by Mont [22], Baines et al. [6] and Beuren et al. [8]: first, consumers may not be enthusiastic about ownerless consumption; second, the manufacturer may be concerned with pricing, absorbing risks and shifting organization; and third, PSS design and development itself is a challenge. PSS is difficult to design because it is an integrated system consisting of products, services, and delivery infrastructure, and is strongly affected by stakeholders. Designers and developers need an appropriate design methodology to deal with each design project. There are several design methodologies available in literature but none of them is holistic to work with a wide range of PSS problems and there is a lack of analysis and guidance of possible applications for each methodology.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, the authors propose eight groups with twenty nine scoring criteria to enable a step by step process that can specifically help designers and practitioners to select appropriate design methodologies for their PSS problems. We also include an example in to illustrate how a company can use the proposed eight groups of scoring criteria and the comparison scheme to identify the most appropriate design methodology for its own specific PSS problem from a set of eight popular existing design methodologies. Future work might contain the topic of developing a new PSS design methodology which is “customizable” and “adaptive” so that it can transform itself to effectively solve a wide range of PSS design problems.There is no conflict of interest for this work.
