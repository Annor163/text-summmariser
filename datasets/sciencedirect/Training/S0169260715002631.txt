@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Because of the increased volume of information available to physicians from advanced medical technology, the obtained information of each symptom with respect to a disease may contain truth, falsity and indeterminacy information. Since a single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) consists of the three terms like the truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership functions, it is very suitable for representing indeterminate and inconsistent information. Then, similarity measure plays an important role in pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. However, existing medical diagnosis methods can only handle the single period medical diagnosis problem, but cannot deal with the multi-period medical diagnosis problems with neutrosophic information. Hence, the purpose of this paper was to propose similarity measures between SVNSs based on tangent function and a multi-period medical diagnosis method based on the similarity measure and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information to solve multi-period medical diagnosis problems with single-valued neutrosophic information. Then, we compared the tangent similarity measures of SVNSs with existing similarity measures of SVNSs by a numerical example about pattern recognitions to indicate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed similarity measures. In the multi-period medical diagnosis method, we can find a proper diagnosis for a patient by the proposed similarity measure between the symptoms and the considered diseases represented by SVNSs and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information. Then, a multi-period medical diagnosis example was presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed diagnosis method and to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method by the comparative analysis. The diagnosis results showed that the developed multi-period medical diagnosis method can help doctors make a proper diagnosis by the comprehensive information of multi-periods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In medical diagnosis problems, due to the complexity of various diseases and the lack of knowledge or data about the problem domain, crisp data are sometimes unavailable as medical diagnosis contains lots of uncertainties. Uncertainty is an important phenomenon of medical diagnosis problems. A symptom is an uncertain indication of a disease. Hence, the uncertainty characterizes a relation between symptoms and diseases. Thus, working with the uncertainties leads us to accurate decision making in medical diagnosis problems. In most of the medical diagnosis problems, there exist some patterns, and then experts make decision according to the similarity between an unknown sample and the basic patterns. However, the arguments introduced from an unknown sample may be vague or fuzzy in nature. To represent incomplete and uncertainty information, Zadeh [1] firstly proposed fuzzy set theory. Its characteristic is that a membership degree is assigned to each element in the set. Since then, various extensions of this concept have been introduced by many researchers. For example, Atanassov [2] extended fuzzy sets to intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). The prominent characteristic of IFS is that a membership degree and a non-membership degree are assigned to each element in the set. Since there is a number of uncertainties in medical diagnoses, they are the most interesting and fruitful areas of applications in intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. Hence, various medical diagnosis methods have been presented under the general framework of IFSs [3,4]. Recently, Ye [5] put forward cosine similarity measures for IFSs and applied them to pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. Hung [6] introduced an intuitionistic fuzzy likelihood-based measurement and applied it to medical diagnosis and bacteria classification problems. Tian [7] developed the cotangent similarity measure of IFSs and applied it to medical diagnosis.However, IFSs can handle only incomplete and uncertainty information but not indeterminate and inconsistent information which exists usually in real situations. To deal with this kind of indeterminate and inconsistent information, Smarandache [8] originally proposed the concept of a neutrosophic set from a philosophical point of view. A neutrosophic set A in a universal set X is characterized independently by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x) and a falsity-membership function FA(x). The functions TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) in X are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]−0, 1+[, such that TA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, IA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, and FA(x): X→]−0, 1+[. However, since the defined range of the functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) in a neutrosophic set A is the non-standard unit interval ]−0, 1+[, the neutrosophic set is only used for philosophical applications, but it is difficult to apply it to science and engineering areas. To use it easily, the defined range of its functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) can be restrained to the normal standard real unit interval [0, 1]. For this purpose, Wang et al. [9] introduced the concept of a single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS), which is a subclass of the neutrosophic set and a generalization of IFS. Because of the increased volume of information available to physicians from advanced medical technology, the obtained information of each symptom with respect to a disease may contain truth, falsity and indeterminacy information. Since a SVNS consists of the three terms like the truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership functions, it is very suitable for representing indeterminate and inconsistent information. However, similarity measure is a key role in the analysis and research of medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, machine learning, decision making, and clustering analysis in uncertainty environment. Therefore, some researchers have proposed various similarity measures of SVNSs and mainly applied them to decision making. For instance, Majumdar and Samanta [10] introduced several similarity measures of SVNSs based on distances, a matching function, membership grades, and then proposed an entropy measure for a SVNS. Ye [11] further proposed the distance-based similarity measure of SVNSs and applied it to group decision making problems with single valued neutrosophic information. Furthermore, Ye [12] proposed three vector similarity measures for simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs), including the Jaccard, Dice and cosine similarity measures for SVNSs and interval neutrosophic sets (INSs), and applied them to multicriteria decision-making problems with simplified neutrosophic information, which contains single-valued and interval neutrosophic information. Although simplified neutrosophic sets (SVNSs and INSs) have been successfully applied to decision making [11–18], they are scarcely applied to medical diagnosis problems.In medical diagnosis, recently, Ye [19] proposed the improved cosine similarity measures of SVNSs and INSs based on cosine function and applied them to medical diagnosis problems. Because the symptoms and inspecting data of some disease may be changed in different time intervals, one of the medical diagnosis questions is whether only by taking a single period inspection we can reach a proper conclusion for a particular patient with a particular decease or not. Sometimes he or she may show symptoms of different diseases also. Then, how can we reach a proper diagnosis for the particular patient by taking one inspection? One solution may be to examine the patient through multi-periods (dynamic inspection in different time intervals) and to realize comprehensive diagnosis for the patient corresponding to the dynamic inspecting information. In this case, multi-period medical diagnosis (i.e. dynamic medical diagnosis) needs a comprehensive diagnosis method. However, the existing medical diagnosis methods [3–7,19] can only handle single period diagnosis problems, but cannot deal with comprehensive medical diagnosis problems in the multi-periods (dynamic diagnosis problems). To handle the multi-period medical diagnosis problem, this paper proposes new similarity measures of SVNSs based on tangent function and a multi-period medical diagnosis method based on the proposed similarity measure and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information to help doctors make a proper diagnosis for a patient.The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic concepts of SVNSs and similarity measures for SVNSs. Section 3 puts forward similarity measures of SVNSs based on tangent function and weighted similarity measures of SVNSs and investigates their properties. In Section 4, we propose a multi-period medical diagnosis method based on the proposed similarity measure and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information. In Section 5, a multi-period medical diagnosis example is provided to illustrate the application of the multi-period medical diagnosis method and to indicate the effectiveness by the comparative analysis. Conclusions and further research are given in Section 6.Smarandache [8] originally presented a neutrosophic set theory. A neutrosophic set A in a universal set X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x) and a falsity-membership function FA(x). Its three functions TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) in X are real standard or nonstandard subsets of]−0, 1+[, such that TA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, IA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, and FA(x): X→]−0, 1+[. Hence, the sum of the three functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) satisfies the condition −0≤sup TA(x)+sup IA(x)+sup FA(x)≤3+.However, Smarandache [8] introduced the neutrosophic set from a philosophical point of view as a generalization of fuzzy set, IFS, and interval-valued IFS. But it is difficult to apply the neutrosophic set to practical problems. To apply it easily in science and engineering fields, Wang et al. [9] introduced the concept of SVNS, which is a subclass of the neutrosophic set, and gave the following definition.Definition 1[9]Let X be a universal set. A SVNS A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x) and a falsity-membership function FA(x). Then, a SVNS A can be denoted byA=x,TA(x),IA(x),FA(x)|x∈Xwhere TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)∈[0, 1] for each x in X. Then, the sum of TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) satisfies the condition 0≤TA(x)+IA(x)+FA(x)≤3.For a SVNS A in X, the triplet 〈TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 is called single valued neutrosophic value (SVNV), which is a fundamental element in a SVNS A. For convenience, we can simply denote a=〈TA, IA, FA〉 as a SVNV in A.LetA=x,TA(x),IA(x),FA(x)|x∈XandB=x,TB(x),IB(x),FB(x)|x∈Xbe two SVNSs in X. Then, Wang et al. [9] gave some relations:(1)Complement:Ac=x,FA(x),1−IA(x),TA(x)|x∈X;Inclusion: A⊆B if and only if TA(x)≤TB(x), IA(x)≥IB(x), FA(x)≥FB(x) for any x in X;Equality: A=B if and only if A⊆B and B⊆A.LetA=xj,TA(xj),IA(xj),FA(xj)|xj∈XandB=xj,TB(xj),IB(xj),FB(xj)|xj∈Xbe any two SVNSs in X={x1, x2, …, xn}. Then, Ye [12] presented the Jaccard, Dice, and cosine similarity measures between SVNSs A and B in vector space, respectively, as follows:(1)SJ(A,B)=1n∑j=1nTA(xj)TB(xj)+IA(xj)IB(xj)+FA(xj)FB(xj)[(TA2(xj)+IA2(xj)+FA2(xj))+(TB2(xj)+IB2(xj)+FB2(xj))−(TA(xj)TB(xj)+IA(xj)IB(xj)+FA(xj)FB(xj))],(2)SD(A,B)=1n∑j=1n2(TA(xj)TB(xj)+IA(xj)IB(xj)+FA(xj)FB(xj))(TA2(xj)+IA2(xj)+FA2(xj))+(TB2(xj)+IB2(xj)+FB2(xj)),(3)SC(A,B)=1n∑j=1nTA(xj)TB(xj)+IA(xj)IB(xj)+FA(xj)FB(xj)TA2(xj)+IA2(xj)+FA2(xj)TB2(xj)+IB2(xj)+FB2(xj).The similarity measures of Sk(A, B) (k=J, D, C) satisfy the following properties [12]:(P1)0≤Sk(A, B)≤1;Sk(A, B)=Sk(B, A);Sk(A, B)=1 if A=B, i.e., TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), and FA(xj)=FB(xj) for xj∈X.To overcome some disadvantages of cosine similarity measures in vector space, Ye [19] introduced two improved similarity measures between SVNSs A and B based on cosine function, respectively, as follows:(4)C1(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπmax(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|,|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|,|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)2,(5)C2(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπ(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|+|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|+|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)6,Then, the cosine similarity measures of Ck(A, B) (k=1, 2) satisfy the following properties (P1)–(P4) [19]:(P1)0≤Ck(A, B)≤1;Ck(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;Ck(A, B)=Ck(B, A);If C is a SVNS in X and A⊆B⊆C, then Ck(A, C)≤Ck(A, B) and Ck(A, C)≤Ck(B, C).Similarity measure is usually an important mathematical tool in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, clustering analysis, and decision making. Therefore, the subsection proposes similarity measures between SVNSs based on tangent function and investigates their properties.Motivated by the improved cosine similarity measures of SVNSs [19] and based on the tangent function, we propose the tangent similarity measures of SVNSs.Definition 2LetA=xj,TA(xj),IA(xj),FA(xj)|xj∈XandB=xj,TB(xj),IB(xj),FB(xj)|xj∈Xbe any two SVNSs in X={x1, x2, …, xn}. Based on the tangent function, we define the following similarity measures between A and B:(6)T1(A,B)=1−1n∑j=1ntanπ4max(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|,|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|,|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|),(7)T2(A,B)=1−1n∑j=1ntanπ12(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|+|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|+|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|).Then, the similarity measures of Tk(A, B) (k=1, 2) have the following proposition.Proposition 1For two SVNSs A and B in X={x1, x2, …, xn}, the similarity measures of Tk(A, B) (k=1, 2) should satisfy the following properties (P1)–(P4):0≤Tk(A, B)≤1;Tk(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;Tk(A, B)=Tk(B, A);If C is a SVNS in X and A⊆B⊆C, then Tk(A, C)≤Tk(A, B) and Tk(A, C)≤Tk(B, C).(P1) Since the value of the tangent function tan(x) is within [0, 1] in x∈[0, π/4], the similarity measure value based on the tangent function also is within [0, 1] according to Eqs. (6) and (7). Hence, there is 0≤Tk(A, B)≤1for k=1, 2.(P2) When A=B, this implies TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2, …, n and xj∈X. ThenTA(xj)−TB(xj)=0,IA(xj)−IB(xj)=0, andFA(xj)−FB(xj)=0. Thus tan(0)=0, Hence Tk(A, B)=1 for k=1, 2.If T(A, B)=1, then it must satisfy tan(0)=0. This impliesTA(xj)−TB(xj)=0,IA(xj)−IB(xj)=0andFA(xj)−FB(xj)=0. Then, there are TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), and FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2, …, n and xj∈X. Hence A=B.(P3) Proof is straightforward.(P4) If A⊆B⊆C, then this implies TA(xj)≤TB(xj)≤TC(xj), IA(xj)≥IB(xj)≥IC(xj) and FA(xj)≥FB(xj)≥FC(xj) for j=1, 2, …, n and xj∈X. Thus, we have the following inequalities:|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|≤|TA(xj)−TC(xj)|,|TB(xj)−TC(xj)|≤|TA(xj)−TC(xj)|,|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|≤|IA(xj)−IC(xj)|,|IB(xj)−IC(xj)|≤|IA(xj)−IC(xj)|,|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|≤|FA(xj)−FC(xj)|,FB(xj)−FC(xj)≤|FA(xj)−FC(xj)|.Hence, Tk(A, C)≤Tk(A, B) and Tk(A, C)≤Tk(B, C) for k=1, 2 since the tangent function is an increasing function within [0, π/4].Therefore, we complete the proofs of these properties. □If we consider the weight of each element xjfor xj∈X={x1, x2, …, xn} and assume that the weight of an element xjis wj(j=1, 2, …, n) with wj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1nwj=1, then we can introduce the following weighted tangent similarity measures between SVNSs A and B:(8)TW1(A,B)=1−∑j=1nwjtanπ4max(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|,|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|,|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|),(9)TW2(A,B)=1−∑j=1nwjtanπ12(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|+|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|+|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|).Especially, when wj=1/n for j=1, 2, …, n, Eqs. (8) and (9) reduce to Eqs. (6) and (7) respectively.Obviously, the weighted tangent similarity measures also have the following proposition.Proposition 2For two SVNSs A and B in X={x1, x2, …, xn}, assume that the weight of an element xjis wj(j=1, 2, …, n) with wj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1nwj=1. Then, the weighted tangent similarity measures of TWk(A, B) for k=1, 2 should satisfy the following properties (P1)–(P4):0≤TWk(A, B)≤1;TWk(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;TWk(A, B)=TWk(B, A);If C is a SVNS in X and A⊆B⊆C, then TWk(A, C)≤TWk(A, B) and TWk(A, C)≤TWk(B, C).By the similar proof method of Proposition 1, we can give the proofs of these properties. They are not repeated here.For the comparison of the similarity measures based on the tangent function with existing similarity measure formulae (1)–(5)[12,19] in single-valued neutrosophic setting, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed tangent similarity measures of SVNSs.Let us consider two SVNSs A and B in X={x} and compare the proposed tangent similarity measures with the existing similarity measures [12,19] for pattern recognitions. By applying Eqs. (1)–(7), the similarity measure results for the pattern recognitions are indicated by the numerical example, as shown in Table 1.For the results of Table 1, the cosine similarity measure Scin [12] not only cannot carry out the recognition between Case 1 and Case 5 but also produces an unreasonable phenomenon for Case 5 and an undefined (unmeaningful) phenomenon for Case 4. Then, we can see that the similarity measures SJ, SD, C1 and T1 cannot carry out the recognition between Case 3 and Case 4, while the similarity measures C2 and T2 can carry out all recognitions. Hence, the similarity measures C2 and T2 demonstrate stronger discrimination among them and are superior to other similarity measures, while the cosine similarity measure SCin vector space demonstrates bad discrimination among them and is inferior to other similarity measures. Obviously, the similarity measures C2 and T2 are very suitable for handling pattern recognition and medical diagnosis problems. Therefore, the similarity measure T2 will be applied to multi-period medical diagnosis problems in this paper.Due to more and more complexity of real medical diagnoses, a lot of information available to physicians from modern medical technology is often incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information. However, by only taking single period inspection, one is difficult to reach a proper conclusion from a particular patient with a particular decease. Sometimes he or she may also show the symptoms of different diseases. Then, how can we give a proper conclusion? One solution may be to examine the patient across different periods and to realize a comprehensive diagnosis for the patient. To do so, we present a multi-period medical diagnosis method to help doctors make a proper diagnosis based on the comprehensive information of multi-periods.Let S={S1, S2, …, Sm} be a set of symptoms, T={t1, t2, …, tq} be a set of periods, and D={D1, D2, …, Dn} be a set of considered diseases. For a patient Pswith various symptoms, we can indicate characteristic values between the patient and symptoms in multi-period medical diagnosis problems, which are shown in Table 2. Then, Table 3shows characteristic values between symptoms and the considered diseases.In Table 2, Cj(tk) denotes the characteristic value between a patient Psand the jth symptom Sj(j=1, 2, …, m) in the kth period tkfor k=1, 2, …, q. Obviously, if q=1, the medical diagnosis problem is usually a single period medical diagnosis problem [19].In Table 3, Cijdenotes the characteristic value between the jth symptom Sj(j=1, 2, …, m) and the ith considered disease Di(i=1, 2, …, n).For a multi-period medical diagnosis problem with single-valued neutrosophic information, the characteristic values between a patient and symptoms are denoted by the form of a SVNV Cj(tk)=〈Tj(tk), Ij(tk), Fj(tk)〉 and the characteristic values between symptoms and the considered diseases are denoted by the form of a SVNV Cij=〈Tij, Iij, Fij〉 for convenience. If we consider that the weight vector of the symptoms isw=(w1, w2, …, wm) with wj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1mwj=1and the weight vector of the periods isω=(ω(t1), ω(t2), …, ω(tq)) with ω(tk)∈[0, 1] and∑k=1qω(tk)=1.Since the tangent similarity measure of Eq. (9) demonstrates stronger discrimination mentioned above, we apply it to multi-period medical diagnosis problems. Thus, the diagnosis steps are given as follows:Step 1: Calculate the similarity measure between a patient Psand the considered disease Di(i=1, 2, …, n) in each period tk(k=1, 2, …, q) by the following formula:(10)TWi(Ps,tk)=1−∑j=1mwjtanπ12(|Tj(tk)−Tij|+|Ij(tk)−Iij|+|Fj(tk)−Fij|).Step 2: Obtain the weighted aggregation values of MTi(Ps) for i=1, 2, …, n by the following formula:(11)MTi(Ps)=∑k=1qTWi(Ps,tk)ω(tk).Step 3: Give a proper diagnosis for the patient Psaccording to the maximum weighted aggregation value.Step 4: End.Since physicians can obtain a lot of information from modem medical technology, medical diagnosis contains a lot of incomplete, uncertainty and inconsistent information. Then, SVNS is a very suitable tool for expressing and handling it. In this section, we provide a medical diagnosis example to demonstrate the application of the proposed multi-period medical diagnosis method and to indicate the effectiveness by the comparative analysis.In the following example, we shall discuss the medical diagnosis problem adapted from [19].Let D={D1, D2, D3, D4, D5}={viral fever, malaria, typhoid, gastritis, stenocardia} be a set of diseases and S={S1, S2, S3, S4, S5}={temperature, headache, stomach pain, cough, chest pain} be a set of symptoms. Then characteristic values between symptoms and the considered diseases are represented by the form of SVNVs, which are shown in Table 4[19].In the medical diagnosis, assume that there are four patients. We have to take three different samples from each patient Ps(s=1, 2, 3, 4) in three periods. For example, the SVNV of a symptom S1 for a patient Psis given as C1(t1)=〈0.8, 0.6, 0.5〉 in the first period t1, which indicates that the characteristic value C1(t1) between the patient Psand the symptom S1 is the truth degree 0.8, falsity degree 0.5 and indeterminacy degree 0.6. Thus, the characteristic values between the four patients and the five symptoms are represented by SVNVs, which can be constructed as Table 5.If we consider that the weight vector of the five symptoms isw=(1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5) and the weight vector of the three periods isω=(0.25, 0.35, 0.4). Thus, the proposed multi-period medical diagnosis method can be applied to the diagnosis problem.To illustrate the proposed multi-period medical diagnostic process of the example, we give the following diagnosis steps for the patient P1 in detail:Step 1: Calculate the similarity measures between the patient P1 and the considered disease Diin each period tkfor i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and k=1, 2, 3 by Eq. (10), as shown in Table 6.Step 2: Obtain the weighted aggregation values of MTi(P1) for i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 by applying Eq. (11): MT1(P1)=0.8183, MT2(P1)=0.7852, MT3(P1)=0.7966, MT4(P1)=0.7427, and MT5(P1)=0.7167.Step 3: The patient P1 suffers from viral fever according to the maximum weighted aggregation value (MT1(P1)=0.8183).For the patients P2, P3 and P4, by the similar diagnosis steps we can obtain the weighted aggregation values of MTi(Ps) for s=2, 3, 4 and i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then, all results are shown in Table 7.To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-period medical diagnosis method, we provide a comparison with the multi-period medical diagnosis method based on the cosine similarity measure of Eq. (5) since the similarity measure of Eq. (5) has stronger discrimination mentioned above.For convenient comparison, assume that Eq. (10) is replaced by the existing cosine measure formula (5)[19] in Step 1 as the following form:(12)SCi(Ps,tk)=1m∑j=1mcosπ6(|Tj(tk)−Tij|+|Ij(tk)−Iij|+|Fj(tk)−Fij|),In Step 2, the weighted aggregation values of MCi(Ps) for i=1, 2, …, n is calculated by the following formula:(13)MCi(Ps)=∑k=1qSCi(Ps,tk)ω(tk).Then, according to Eqs. (12) and (13), the weighted aggregation values of MCi(Ps) for s=1, 2, 3, 4 and i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be obtained, which are shown in Table 7.From the results of Table 7, since the largest measure values indicate the proper diagnosis, the two patients P1 and P3 suffer from viral fever, the patient P2 suffers from malaria, and the patient P4 suffers from stenocardia. Obviously, the diagnosis results based on the tangent similarity measure and the cosine similarity measure are identical and show the effectiveness of the multi-period medical diagnosis method proposed in this paper. However, the two similarity measures imply rationality to be used for the multi-period medical diagnosis problem because the tangent similarity measure and the improved cosine similarity measure indicate stronger discrimination in Section 3.Compared with the medical diagnosis methods in [3–7,19], the multi-period medical diagnosis in this paper is a comprehensive medical diagnosis method with examining a patient through multi-periods, which obtains the diagnosis conclusion based on the tangent similarity measure of SVNSs and the information aggregation of multi-periods. However, the medical diagnosis methods in [3–7,19] cannot handle the multi-period medical diagnosis problem with neutrosophic information. Since the single period medical diagnosis problem is a special case of the multi-period medical diagnosis problem, the proposed multi-period medical diagnosis method can deal with the medical diagnosis problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information and single valued neutrosophic information in [3–7,19]. Furthermore, the multi-period medical diagnosis method presented in this paper is superior to the single period medical diagnosis method proposed in [19] because the later is difficult to give a proper diagnosis for a particular patient with a particular decease in some situations and the former has to examine the patient through multi-periods and to consider the weighted information aggregation of multi-periods in order to obtain a proper conclusion for the patient. From the multi-period medical diagnosis point of view, the proposed multi-period medical diagnosis method is more suitable and more reasonable to find a proper disease diagnosis than the existing medical diagnosis methods.
