This paper focuses on generating the optimal solutions of the solid transportation problem under fuzzy environment, in which the supply capacities, demands and transportation capacities are supposed to be type-2 fuzzy variables due to the instinctive imprecision. In order to model the problem within the framework of the credibility optimization, three types of new defuzzification criteria, i.e., optimistic value criterion, pessimistic value criterion and expected value criterion, are proposed for type-2 fuzzy variables. Then, the multi-fold fuzzy solid transportation problem is reformulated as the chance-constrained programming model with the least expected transportation cost. To solve the model, fuzzy simulation based tabu search algorithm is designed to seek approximate optimal solutions. Numerical experiments are implemented to illustrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traditional transportation problem (TP), which only considers two types of constraints associated with sources and destinations, is one of the well-known network optimization problems. In practice, as the conveyance capacity is another critical parameter in transportation activities, numerous researchers have concentrated their studies on the solid transportation problem by simultaneously considering restrictions of sources, destinations and conveyances. Clearly, the traditional transportation problem is a special case of the solid transportation problem if only one type of conveyance is taken into account. With this concern, the solid transportation problem can be regarded as a generalization of the traditional transportation problem (see Haley [1,2] for the differences between these two problems).Due to the complex environment during the transportation activities, some critical parameters in the solid transportation problem are always treated as uncertain variables to meet the practical situations. For instance, if one needs to make a transportation plan for the next month, the supply capacity at each source, the demand at each destination and the conveyance capacity are often required to be estimated by professional judgments or probability statistics because of no precise a priori information. In this case, it is more suitable to investigate this problem by using fuzzy or stochastic optimization methodologies. (The relevant theoretical methods can be referred to probability theory and fuzzy set theory, which can also be included in the framework of Granular Computing proposed by Pedrycz [23,24].) Up to now, a variety of researches in literature have handled the solid transportation problems under the uncertain environments. For instance, Jiménez and Verdegay [3] formulated a balanced fuzzy solid transportation problem by considering fuzzy supplies, fuzzy demands and fuzzy conveyance capacities. Liu [4] investigated a non-balanced solid transportation problem in condition that the supply capacities, demands, and conveyance capacities are all convex fuzzy numbers. Yang and Liu [5] proposed the fuzzy programming models for the fixed charge solid transportation problem by assuming that the direct costs, fixed charges, supplies, demands and conveyance capacities are fuzzy variables. Kundu et al. [6] discussed a multi-objective multi-item solid transportation problem with fuzzy coefficients. Ojha et al. [7] treated the source availabilities, destination demands and conveyance capacities as different types of fuzzy numbers, such as general, trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers. Molla et al. [8] investigated a fixed charge solid transportation problem under a fuzzy environment and employed three meta-heuristics to solve the problem. Yang and Feng [9] studied a bi-criteria solid transportation problem, where the parameters are random variables, and designed a hybrid algorithm to generate an approximate optimal solution. Ojha et al. [10] studied a stochastic discounted multi-objective solid transportation problem for breakable items by using analytical hierarchy process.In reality, uncertainty may exist with multi-fold. For example, in estimating the membership degree of a fuzzy demand, it is not easy to deduce a crisp membership function because of the instinctive imprecision. To handle this case, the type-2 fuzzy set theory was introduced by Zadeh [11] in 1975, and further improved by Liu and Liu [12] in 2007 through using the credibility theory. As for the further development of type-2 fuzzy theory, Qin et al. [13] presented three kinds of critical values for a regular fuzzy variable and proposed different methods for the reduction of a type-2 fuzzy variable; Coupland and John [14] presented a new method based on geometric representations and operations for defuzzifing a type-2 fuzzy set; Wu and Mendel [27] defined the concepts of uncertainty measures (including cardinality, fuzziness, variance and skewness) for interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Kundu et al. [25] discussed two fixed charge transportation problems with type-2 fuzzy variables; Greenfield et al. [26] provided a novel approach to improve the speed of defuzzification for discretized generalized type-2 fuzzy sets.For the solid transportation problem with fuzzy information, we have two motivations to explore this problem within the framework of type-2 fuzzy set theory. Firstly, it is more general and commonsense to treat some critical parameters as type-2 fuzzy variables because of the practical difficulties of determining their crisp membership functions. Secondly, when some parameters are assumed to be type-2 fuzzy variables, designing an effective method to handle the optimization problem is also a challenging issue. With this concern, we are particularly interested in how to formulate the transportation model, and then design effective algorithms to produce the optimal transportation strategies. To this end, this study proposes three new defuzziness methods for type-2 fuzzy variables based on the credibility measure, and then formulates the problem as a chance-constrained expected value programming model. Fuzzy simulation based tabu search algorithm is also designed to seek an approximate optimal solution for the model. Numerical experiments show the application and efficiency of the proposed approaches.This paper is organized as follows. In Section “Problem statements”, we present a detailed description for the solid transportation problem. In Section “Type-2 fuzzy variables”, we introduce some fundamental knowledge with respect to type-2 fuzzy variables. Then, three types of defuzzification methods are proposed for type-2 fuzzy variables in Section “Defuzzification methods for type-2 fuzzy variables”, where we deduce the possibility distributions of the reduced type-1 fuzzy parameters for type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variables. Section “Reformulation of the solid transportation problem with type-2 fuzzy variables” reformulates the solid transportation problem with type-2 fuzzy parameters as a chance-constrained expected value model. In Section “Numerical experiments”, several numerical examples are implemented to illustrate the efficiency of the model and algorithm. Finally, a conclusion is made in the last section.For the completeness of this research, we shall give a detailed description for the solid transportation problem (STP) in this section. As an extension of the traditional transportation problem which only considers two factors (i.e., source and destination), the STP is related to how to transport products from sources to destinations by conveyances so as to minimize the total transportation cost. For any STP, when the total supply of products, the total demand of products and the total transportation capacity of conveyances are equal to each other, we call such a problem as a balanced solid transportation problem. However, when the balance condition cannot be established, we have to investigate the non-balanced solid transportation problem, in which it is required that the total available resources and the total capacities of conveyances are not less than the total demands of destinations. The non-balanced solid transportation problem can be formulated as follows:(1)minZ=∑i=1I∑j=1J∑k=1Kcijkxijkst.∑j=1J∑k=1Kxijk≤ai,i=1,2,...,I∑i=1I∑k=1Kxijk≥bj,j=1,2,...,J∑i=1I∑j=1Jxijk≤ek,k=1,2,...,Kxijk≥0,∀i,j,k,where the meanings of notations are listed as follows: i(=1, 2, …I) is the index of source; j(=1, 2, …J) is the index of destination; k(=1, 2, …K) is the index of conveyance; aiis the total supply of products in source i; bjis the total demand of products in destination j; ekis the total transportation capacity of conveyance k; cijkis the unit transportation cost from source i to destination j by conveyance k; xijkis the decision variable, which represents the transportation quantity from source i to destination j by conveyance k.In this model, the first constraint states that the total amount of products transported from source i are no more than the total supply in source i; the second constraint implies that the total amount of products transported from different sources should be greater than the demands of destination j; the third constraint requires that the total amount of products transported from different sources to different destinations by conveyance k are not greater than its transportation capacity. In addition, an implicit non-balance constraint for this model is∑i=1Iai≥∑j=1Jbjand∑k=1Kek≥∑j=1Jbj. Apparently, the formulated non-balanced solid transportation problem is a linear programming model.Fig. 1is given to clearly illustrate the transportation process in solid transportation problems, in which the products are required to be transported from two sources to three destinations by three types of conveyances. Thus, the aim of this problem is to generate an optimal transportation plan from source nodes to destination nodes by different conveyances (i.e., train, truck and ship). In transportation planning process, three constraints need to be considered. (1) For destination j (say node 1), the total amount of products transported from source 1 and source 2 by trains and ships should be greater than the demands of this node. (2) For source i (say node 1), the total amount of products, which are transported to three destinations by three types of conveyances, should be less than the supply capacities of this source. (3) For conveyance trains, when we transport products from sources 1 and 2 to destinations 1 and 3, the total amount of products should not be beyond the transportation capacities of trains, and the similar constraints are also applicable to ships and trucks.The above mathematical model is formulated with certain parameters taking fixed values, which can be effectively solved by some heuristics, for instance, tabu search algorithm (Yang and Feng [9]), analytical hierarchy process (Ojha et al. [10]), genetic algorithm (Vignaux and Michalewicz [15]), etc. However, in reality, it is difficult to figure out the crisp values of some parameters due to the complexity of the decision environment and the incompleteness of a prior information. In this case, the relevant parameters can be endowed with uncertain characteristics, and stochastic or fuzzy methods can be expectedly adopted to handle this problem effectively. As for stochastic optimization, it is often required that the sample size (historical data) is sufficiently large to estimate the probability distributions. If the sample size is too small (or even no sample is available) owing to information incompleteness, one may turn to the fuzzy theory by estimating their membership functions. Practically, it is widely recognized that fuzziness often occurs with multi-fold forms in real-world decision environments. Then, in this study we are particularly interested in the formulation and solution methods for the solid transportation problem when some parameters are considered as type-2 fuzzy variables. In order to effectively formulate the non-balanced STP under two-fold fuzzy environment, we firstly introduce some fundamental knowledge with regard to type-2 fuzzy variables and some defuzzification methods in Sections “Type-2 fuzzy variables” and “Defuzzification methods for type-2 fuzzy variables”.As an extension of the traditional fuzzy set theory, Zadeh [11] introduced the concept of type-2 fuzzy sets in 1975, in which a type-2 fuzzy variable is described by the fuzzy membership function. To set up an axiomatic foundation for type-2 fuzzy theory, Liu and Liu [12,16] defined the concept of fuzzy possibility space and proposed different defuzzification methods. The following discussion is mainly based on the results proposed by Liu and Liu [12].Hereinafter, we firstly introduce the concepts of possibility space, fuzzy variables and credibility measure. Let Θ be a nonempty set, P(Θ) the power set of Θ and Pos a mapping from P(Θ) to [0,1]. A triplet (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) is called a possibility space if it satisfies the following conditions:(I)Pos{Θ}=1 and Pos{Φ}=0.For any {Ai|i∈I}⊂P(Θ),Pos{∪i∈IAi}=supi∈IPos{Ai}.A fuzzy variable ξ is defined as a function from the possibility space (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) to the set of real numbers ℜ to describe fuzzy phenomena, where the possibility measure (Pos) of fuzzy event {ξ∈B} is defined byPos{ξ∈B}=supx∈Bμξ(x).Here μξ(x) represents the possibility distribution (membership function) of ξ.The necessity measure (Nec) is defined asNec{ξ∈B}=1−Pos{ξ∈Bc}=1−supx∈Bcμξ(x),i.e., the necessity of fuzzy event {ξ∈B} is defined as the impossibility of the opposite event, and the credibility measure (Liu and Liu [17]) of {ξ∈B} is defined asCr{ξ∈B}=12(Pos{ξ∈B}+Nec{ξ∈B}).If a fuzzy variable with the membership function μξ(x) satisfiessupx∈ℜμξ(x)=1, we call this fuzzy variable as a regular fuzzy variable (RFV). In Liu and Liu [16], they also give a formal definition of RFV on interval [0,1].Definition 3.2.1(Liu and Liu [16]) Let (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) be a possibility space. A regular fuzzy variable ξ on interval [0,1] is defined as a measurable mapping from Θ to the space [0, 1] such that for every t∈[0, 1],If the possibility distribution of ξ is as follows:ξ∼r1r2r3⋯rnμ1μ2μ3⋯μn,where ri∈[0, 1], μi>0 for each i=1, 2, ..., n andmaxi=1nμi=1, then ξ is a discrete RFV.If ξ=[r1, r2] with 0≤r1<r2≤1, then ξ is an interval RFV on interval [0,1].If ξ=(r1, r2, r3) with 0≤r1<r2<r3≤1, then ξ is a triangular RFV on interval [0,1].If ξ=(r1, r2, r3, r4) with 0≤r1<r2<r3<r4≤1, then ξ is a trapezoidal RFV on interval [0,1].This paper focuses the discussion on regular fuzzy variables, but for an irregular fuzzy variable, we can firstly transform it into a RFV. Here, we take the discrete irregular fuzzy variable as an example to illustrate the regularization method.•Regularization method:Let ξ be a discrete fuzzy variable,ξ∼r1r2r3…rnμ1μ2μ3…μn.Ifmaxi=1nμi<1, then ξ is called an irregular fuzzy variable. In order to convert an irregular fuzzy variable ξ into a regular fuzzy variable, we give the following regularization steps:•Step 1: select the maximum μmax from μi(i=1, 2, …n);Step 2: calculate regularization multiplier 1/μmax;Step 3: multiply by 1/μmax for all μi(i=1, 2, …, n).By using the above procedure, we finally produce the following possibility distribution, which is obviously a regular fuzzy variable:r1r2r3…rnμ1μ2μ3…μn⇒r1r2r3…rnμ1μmaxμ2μmaxμ3μmax…μnμmax.We give an example to illustrate the process of regularization as follows:Example 3.2.1Let ξ be a discrete RFV with the following possibility distribution:Clearly, we havemaxi=14μi=0.8<1, i.e., μmax=0.8. Thus, for each possibility measure, we multiply it by regularization multiplier (1/μmax=1/0.8) and produce the following possibility distribution. Then, ξ is transformed into a regular fuzzy variable ξ′ on interval [0,1].ξ′∼0.50.60.70.90.250.510.75.In essence, fuzzy variables defined on the possibility space are referred to as type-1 fuzzy variables, in which the membership value of an element reflects the degree belonging to this type-1 fuzzy variable, and moreover, the membership values are accurately predetermined. However, as an extension of the type-1 fuzzy variable, the type-2 fuzzy variable aims to fuzzify membership values, where the membership value is no longer an exact value but a type-1 regular fuzzy variable on [0,1]. The following discussion focuses on the introduction of type-2 fuzzy variables proposed by Liu and Liu [16].Definition 3.3.1(Liu and Liu [12]) Let P(Θ) be an ample field on the universe Θ, F([0, 1]) the set of all regular fuzzy variables on [0,1], andP˜os:P(Θ)↦F([0,1])a set function on P(Θ) such that{P˜os(A)|atomA∈P(Θ)}is a family of mutually independent RFVs. We callP˜osa fuzzy possibility measure if it satisfies the following conditions:(P˜1)P˜os{Φ}=0˜;(P˜2) for any subclass {Ai|i∈I} of P(Θ) (finite, countable or uncountable),P˜os{∪i∈IAi}=supi∈IP˜os{Ai}.Moreover, ifμP˜os(Θ)(1)=1, then we callP˜osa regular fuzzy possibility measure.Definition 3.3.2(Liu and Liu [12]) The triplet(Θ,P(Θ),P˜os)is referred to as a fuzzy possibility space (FPS), in which a mappingξ˜:Θ↦ℜis called a type-2 fuzzy variable if for any r∈ℜ, the set{θ∈Θ|ξ˜(θ)≤r}is an element of P(Θ), i.e.,{θ∈Θ|ξ˜(θ)≤r}∈P(Θ).(Liu and Liu [16]) Letξ˜be a type-2 fuzzy variable defined on an FPS(Θ,P(Θ),P˜os). The secondary possibility distribution functionμ˜ξ˜(x)ofξ˜is defined as a mapping ℜ↦F([0, 1]) such thatμ˜ξ˜(x)=P˜os{θ∈Θ|ξ˜(θ)=x},x∈ℜ, while the type-2 possibility distribution functionμξ˜(x,u)ofξ˜is a mapping ℜ×Jx↦[0, 1] such thatThe support of a type-2 fuzzy variableξ˜is denoted as(3)suppξ˜={(x,u)∈ℜ×[0,1]|μξ˜(x,u)>0}.The type-2 triangular fuzzy variable is an important concept proposed by Liu and Liu [16], which has a secondary possibility distribution depicted below.Definition 3.3.4(Liu and Liu [16]) Ifξ˜is a type-2 triangular fuzzy variable, denoted byξ˜=(r1,r2,r3;θl,θr), the secondary possibility distributionμ˜ξ˜(x)is defined as a type-1 regular triangular fuzzy variable, i.e.,Motivated by the concept of type-2 triangular fuzzy variables, we especially extend the definition of the secondary possibility distributions for type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variables in the following:Definition 3.3.5Ifξ˜is a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable, denoted byξ˜=(r1,r2,r3,r4;θl,θr), the secondary possibility distributionμ˜ξ˜(x)is defined as a type-1 regular triangular fuzzy variable, i.e.,Obviously, for a type-2 triangular fuzzy variable, the membership value of an element x in [r1, r3] does not take a crisp value but a regular triangular fuzzy variable. Likewise, for a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable, the membership value of an element x in [r1, r2]∪[r3, r4] also takes a regular triangular fuzzy variable.For application purpose, some detailed defuzzification methods for type-2 fuzzy variables will be introduced in this section, which can be conceived as a simplification process for two-fold uncertain information. Based on this, a type-2 fuzzy variable can be easily converted into a type-1 fuzzy variable with the aid of reduction methods.In order to define the defuzzification methods for type-2 fuzzy variables, we firstly introduce three types of critical values (CVs) for a regular fuzzy variable (RFV) by adopting the criteria proposed by Liu and Liu [17], Liu [18], including optimistic value criterion, pessimistic value criterion and expected value criterion.Let ξ be a RFV. Then,(I)the optimistic value of ξ, denoted byCVα*[ξ], is defined as:(8)CVα*[ξ]=sup{r|Cr{ξ≥r}≥α};the pessimistic value of ξ, denoted byCV*α[ξ], is defined as:(9)CV*α[ξ]=inf{r|Cr{ξ≤r}≥α};the expected value of ξ, denoted by E[ξ], is defined as:(10)E[ξ]=∫0+∞Cr{ξ≥r}dr−∫−∞0Cr{ξ≤r}dr.Next, an example is given here to clearly illustrate the different critical values defined above.Example 4.1.1Let ξ be a discrete RFV with the following possibility distribution:Fig. 2gives the involved credibility functions with respect to credibility measure.The optimistic value and pessimistic value of this fuzzy variable can be easily calculated byCVα*[ξ]=sup{r|Cr{ξ≥r}≥α}=0.9,0<α≤0.30.7,0.3<α≤0.60.5,0.6<α≤0.8⁡0.2,0.8<α≤1.CV*α[ξ]=inf{r|Cr{ξ≤r}≥α}=0.2,0<α≤0.20.5,0.2<α≤0.40.7,0.4<α≤0.70.9,0.7<α≤1.Additionally, the expected value is calculated byE[ξ]=∑i=14ωiri=0.2×0.2+0.2×0.5+0.3×0.7+0.3×0.9=0.62.In the following, we shall deduce general formulations of critical values for trapezoidal fuzzy variables.Example 4.1.2Let ξ be a trapezoidal RFV, denoted by ξ=(r1, r2, r3, r4). Then, according to the membership function μξ(x), we have the involved credibility functions in Fig. 3:The optimistic value of ξ is(11)CVα*[ξ]=sup{r|Cr{ξ≥r}≥α}=2αr3+(1−2α)r4,0<α≤0.5,2(1−α)r2−(1−2α)r1,0.5<α≤1.Similarly, the pessimistic value of ξ is(12)CV*α[ξ]=inf{r|Cr{ξ≤r}≥α}=(1−2α)r1+2αr2,0<α≤0.5,(2α−1)r4+2(1−α)r3,0.5<α≤1,and the expected value of ξ is(13)E[ξ]=14(r1+r2+r3+r4).Remark 4.1.1Typically, interval fuzzy variables and triangular fuzzy variables are special forms of trapezoidal fuzzy variables. According to Example 4.1.2, the critical values of interval fuzzy variables and triangular fuzzy variables can be easily inferred.Obviously, type-2 fuzzy variables can be used to characterize two-fold forms in realistic decision environment. However, one of the core problems is that the computational complexity will increase when some parameters are regarded as type-2 fuzzy variables in the optimization models. Because of this, we shall focus on converting type-2 fuzzy variables into type-1 fuzzy variables with the aid of defuzzification methods proposed in Section “The critical values of regular fuzzy variables”. That is, the fuzzy membership function will be represented by its critical values. The following discussion is mainly on the possibility distributions of the deduced type-1 fuzzy variables. Firstly, for a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable, we have the following results.Theorem 4.2.1Letξ˜=(r1,r2,r3,r4;θl,θr)be a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable. We assume thatξα*,ξ*αand ξE, respectively, are deduced type-1 fuzzy variables by the optimistic value criterion, pessimistic value criterion and expected value criterion. We then havetype-1 fuzzy variableξα*deduced by the optimistic value criterion has the following possibility distributions:(14)μξα*(x)=(x−r1)(1+θr−2αθr)r2−r1,x∈r1,r1+r22(x−r1)+(1−2α)θr(r2−x)r2−r1,x∈(r1+r22,r2]1,x∈(r2,r3]0<α≤0.5(r4−x)+(1−2α)θr(x−r3)r4−r3,x∈(r3,r3+r42](r4−x)(1+θr−2αθr)r4−r3,x∈(r3+r42,r4];(15)μξα*(x)=(x−r1)(1+θl−2αθl)r2−r1,x∈r1,r1+r22(x−r1)+(1−2α)θl(r2−x)r2−r1,x∈(r1+r22,r2]1,x∈(r2,r3]0.5<α≤1(r4−x)+(1−2α)θl(x−r3)r4−r3,x∈(r3,r3+r42](r4−x)(1+θl−2αθl)r4−r3,x∈(r3+r42,r4];type-1 fuzzy variableξ*αdeduced by the pessimistic value criterion has the following possibility distributions:(16)μξ*α(x)=(x−r1)(1−θl+2αθl)r2−r1,x∈[r1,r1+r22](x−r1)−(1−2α)θl(r2−x)r2−r1,x∈(r1+r22,r2]1,x∈(r2,r3]0<α≤0.5(r4−x)−(1−2α)θl(x−r3)r4−r3,x∈(r3,r3+r42](r4−x)(1−θl+2αθl)r4−r3,x∈(r3+r42,r4],(17)μξ*α(x)=(x−r1)(1−θr+2αθr)r2−r1,x∈r1,r1+r22(x−r1)−(1−2α)θr(r2−x)r2−r1,x∈(r1+r22,r2]1,x∈(r2,r3]0.5<α≤1(r4−x)−(1−2α)θr(x−r3)r4−r3,x∈(r3,r3+r42](r4−x)(1−θr+2αθr)r4−r3,x∈(r3+r42,r4];type-1 fuzzy variable ξEdeduced by the expected value criterion has the following possibility distributions:(18)μξE(x)=x−r1r2−r1−14(θl−θr)x−r1r2−r1,x∈[r1,r1+r22]x−r1r2−r1−14(θl−θr)r2−xr2−r1,x∈(r1+r22,r2]1,x∈(r2,r3]r4−xr4−r3−14(θl−θr)x−r3r4−r3,x∈(r3,r3+r42]r4−xr4−r3−14(θl−θr)r4−xr4−r3,x∈(r3+r42,r4].The theorem given above illustrates the possibility distributions of the deduced type-1 fuzzy variables with respect to x∈[r1, r2] and x∈(r3, r4]. In addition, the secondary possibility distribution of a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable is 1 for any x∈(r2, r3] according to the Definition 3.3.5. That is, for any x∈(r2, r3], the possibility distributions of the deduced type-1 fuzzy variables via three defuzzification methods areμξα*(x)=μξ*α(x)=μξE(x)=1,0<α≤1.We next give a detail proof of the possibility distributions of the deduced type-1 fuzzy variables.Proof(I)According to the Definition 3.3.5, Example 4.1.2 and Remark 4.1.1, type-1 fuzzy variableξα*has the following possibility distributions:μξα*(x)=2αx−r1r2−r1+(1−2α)x−r1r2−r1+θrminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1,0<α≤0.52(1−α)x−r1r2−r1−(1−2α)x−r1r2−r1−θlminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1,0.5<α≤1for any x∈[r1, r2], andμξ1α(x)=2αr4−xr4−r3+(1−2α)r4−xr4−r3+θrminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3,0<α≤0.52(1−α)r4−xr4−r3−(1−2α)r4−xr4−r3−θlminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3,0.5<α≤1for any x∈(r3, r4].Type-1 fuzzy variableξ*αhas the following possibility distributions:μξ*α(x)=2αx−r1r2−r1+(1−2α)x−r1r2−r1−θlminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1,0<α≤0.52(1−α)x−r1r2−r1−(1−2α)x−r1r2−r1+θrminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1,0.5<α≤1for any x∈[r1, r2], andμξ*α(x)=2αr4−xr4−r3+(1−2α)r4−xr4−r3−θlminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3,0<α≤0.52(1−α)r4−xr4−r3−(1−2α)r4−xr4−r3+θrminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3,0.5<α≤1for any x∈(r3, r4].Type-1 fuzzy variable ξEhas the following possibility distributions:μξE(x)=14x−r1r2−r1−θlminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1+x−r1r2−r1+x−r1r2−r1+x−r1r2−r1+θrminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1for any x∈[r1, r2], andμξE(x)=14r4−xr4−r3−θlminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3+r4−xr4−r3+r4−xr4−r3+r4−xr4−r3+θrminr4−xr4−r3,x−r3r4−r3for any x∈(r3, r4].After simplifying the above equations, we can prove Theorem 4.2.1.Next, an example will be given to illustrate the calculation of the reduced type-1 fuzzy variables.Letξ˜=(3,4,5,6;θl=0.5,θr=1)be a type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable. By using Theorem 4.2.1, we infer the possibility functions for each generated type-1 fuzzy variable as follows:To understand the membership functions more straightforwardly, Figs. 4–6, respectively, are given to depict geometric graphs for the obtained possibility distribution functions. Moreover, Fig. 7is also given to depict the support of the type-2 fuzzy variable.Remark 4.2.2For simplicity, the above discussion only considers the type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable with the formξ˜=(r1,r2,r3,r4;θl,θr). However, since the type-2 triangular fuzzy variable is in essence a special form of the type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy variable when r2=r3, the deduced type-1 fuzzy variables by three reduction criteria for type-2 triangular fuzzy variables can also be calculated similarly.Finally, we aim to show the reduction methods for type-2 discrete fuzzy variables. For this purpose, we consider the following type-2 discrete fuzzy variable:ξ˜=1,with possibility[0.1,0.5],2,with possibility(0.2,0.5,0.6),3,with possibility(0.1,0.3,0.6,0.8).Obviously, for this type-2 fuzzy variable, the possibility of each outcome takes a value represented by a type-1 fuzzy variable. That is,ξ˜takes the value 1, 2 and 3 with fuzzy possibilities [0.1, 0.5], (0.2, 0.5, 0.6), (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8), respectively. By using the defuzzification methods, we haveCVα*[μ˜ξ˜(1)]=0.5,0<α≤0.50.1,0.5<α≤1,CV*α[μ˜ξ˜(1)]=0.1,0<α≤0.50.5,0.5<α≤1,CVα*[μ˜ξ˜(2)]=0.6−0.2α,0<α≤0.50.8−0.6α,0.5<α≤1,CV*α[μ˜ξ˜(2)]=0.2+0.6α,0<α≤0.50.4+0.2α,0.5<α≤1,CVα*[μ˜ξ˜(3)]=0.8−0.4α,0<α≤0.50.5−0.4α,0.5<α≤1,CV*α[μ˜ξ˜(3)]=0.1+0.4α,0<α≤0.50.4+0.4α,0.5<α≤1,E[μ˜ξ˜(1)]=0.3,E[μ˜ξ˜(2)]=0.45,E[μ˜ξ˜(3)]=0.45.By the operations mentioned above, the generated type-1 fuzzy variables are not necessarily regular as the maximum value of possibility measures for outcomes is not necessarily equal to 1. Then, we can employ the regularization method previously proposed to transform an irregular fuzzy variable into a regular fuzzy variable. Take the type-1 fuzzy variable generated by the expected value criterion as an example. Since the irregular fuzzy variable isξE=1230.30.450.45,we have μmax=0.45<1 and regularization multiplier 1/μmax=1/0.45. Then, the generated regular type-1 fuzzy variable turns out to be:ξ′E=1232/311.By using the defuzzification methods proposed in Section “Defuzzification methods for type-2 fuzzy variables”, we shall reformulate the solid transportation problem as a chance-constrained expected value programming model in the following.In the solid transportation problem, due to the complexity of the decision environments and the incompleteness of a prior information, it is not easy to precisely estimate the crisp values of some parameters. Then, in this study we assume that the supply capacities, demands, conveyances capacities and unit transportation costs are all type-2 fuzzy variables pre-specified by professional judgments, denoted bya˜i,b˜j,e˜kandc˜ijk, respectively. Then we have the following formulation:(19)minZ=∑i=1I∑j=1J∑k=1Kc˜ijkxijkst.∑j=1J∑k=1Kxijk≤a˜i,i=1,2,…,I∑i=1I∑k=1Kxijk≥b˜j,j=1,2,…,J∑i=1I∑j=1Jxijk≤e˜k,k=1,2,...,Kxijk≥0,∀i,j,k.Apparently, the formulation (19) is an uncertain model without specific mathematical meanings. Next, we are intended to use the defuzzification criteria proposed above to generate the corresponding type-1 fuzzy variables, and then reformulate the model based on the expected value operator of fuzzy variables and credibility measure. For simplicity, type-2 fuzzy variablesc˜ijk,a˜i,b˜j,e˜kare reduced into type-1 variablesc¯ijk,a¯i,b¯j,e¯k, respectively.In literature, the fuzzy optimization methods have been applied to a variety of real-world decision-making problems up to now (see Liu and Liu [17], Yang et al. [19–22], Kundu et al. [25], Qin et al. [13]). Through minimizing the expected value of the total transportation cost with chance constraints, we finally reformulate the solid transportation problem into the following fuzzy optimization model:(20)minE[Z]=E∑i=1I∑j=1J∑k=1Kc¯ijkxijkst.Cr∑j=1J∑k=1Kxijk≤a¯i≥ρi,i=1,2,…,ICr∑i=1I∑k=1Kxijk≥b¯j≥βj,j=1,2,…,JCr∑i=1I∑j=1Jxijk≤e¯k≥γk,k=1,2,…,Kxijk≥0,∀i,j,k,where ρi(i=1, 2, …, I), βj(j=1, 2, …, J) and γk(k=1, 2, …, K) are predetermined credibility confidence levels. In this model, the objective function is to minimize the expected total transportation cost. The chance constraints aim to require that the credibility measures of supply capacity constraints, demand constraints and transportation capacity constraints, respectively, should not be less than the pre-specified confidence levels ρi(i=1, 2, …, I), βj(j=1, 2, …, J) and γk(k=1, 2, …, K), for guaranteeing the reliability of the optimized transportation strategies.For solution convenience, we here discuss an equivalent form to further simplify the expected value model. To this end, a proposition is firstly given in the following.Proposition 5.1(Yang and Liu [5]) Suppose that ξ is a fuzzy number with continuous membership function μξ(x), g(x, ξ)=h(x)−ξ.Let r0=inf{r|μξ(r)=1}. Then we have Cr{g(x, ξ)≤0}≥α if and only if h(x)≤Fξ(α), where(21)Fξ(α)=sup{F|F=μξ−1(2α)},α≤0.5,sup{F|F=μξ−1(2(1−α)),F<r0},α>0.5.Let r0=sup{r|μξ(r)=1}. Then we have Cr{g(x, ξ)≥0}≥α if and only if h(x)≥Fξ(α), where(22)Fξ(α)=inf{F|F=μξ−1(2α)},α≤0.5,inf{F|F=μξ−1(2(1−α)),F>r0},α>0.5.Moreover, ifc¯ijk(∀i,j,k)are independent fuzzy variables, we can produce an equivalent model below.(23)minE[Z]=∑i=1I∑j=1J∑k=1KE[c¯ijk]xijkst.∑j=1J∑k=1Kxijk≤Fρ¯i(ρi),i=1,2,...,I∑i=1I∑k=1Kxijk≥Fβ¯j(βj),j=1,2,...,J∑i=1I∑j=1Jxijk≤Fγ¯k(γk),k=1,2,...,Kxijk≥0,∀i,j,k,where, the first and third constraints are inferred by Eq. (21), and the second constraint is deduced by Eq. (22).To solve the proposed model, a tabu search based solution algorithm, designed by Yang and Liu [5], will be employed in this study. The algorithmic process is particularly given below for the completeness of this research.•Tabu Search Algorithm:•Step 1: Randomly choose a solution x. Let present.sol=x, best.sol=x, present_step=0, best_step=0, then initialize tabu list;Step 2: Produce the neighborhood N (present.sol) of present.sol, let present step++;Step 3: Compute the objective values of the elements in N (present.sol) by fuzzy simulation;Step 4: Find the best solution x*in N (present.sol) such that x*is non-tabu or satisfies aspiration criterion;Step 5: If the objective value of solution x*is better than that of best.sol, then let present.sol=x*, best.sol=x*, best_step=present_step; otherwise, let present.sol=x*;Step 6: Update the tabu list;Step 7: If present_step-best_step≤M (the largest number of iteration that objective value of best.sol does not change), go to Step 2; otherwise go to Step 8;Step 8: Output best.sol, stop.In the algorithm, the meanings of different symbols are:x: the index of a feasible solution;present.sol: the best solution in the neighborhood;best.sol: the optimal solution obtained up to the current iteration;present_step: the current iteration number;best_step: the iteration number when we get the optimal solution.In this section, a set of numerical experiments will be implemented to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.In the experiments, assume that there are four sources (denoted by O), five destinations (denoted by D) and two conveyances. The relevant unit transportation costs between different ODs by different conveyances are given in Tables 1 and 2, which are represented by type-2 triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy variables.In addition, the total supply of products, total demand of products and total capacity of conveyances, respectively, are listed as follows:a˜1=(72,74,76,77;0.4,0.8),a˜2=(74,75,79,80;0.5,1),a˜3=(74,76,78,79;0.3,0.7),a˜4=(67,68,69,70;0.2,0.6),b˜1=(38,39,40,42;0.5,1),b˜2=(58,60,61,62;0.4,0.8),b˜3=(45,47,49,51;0.3,0.7),b˜4=(42,43,44,45;0.4,0.6),b˜5=(54,58,59,60;0.2,0.7),e˜1=(138,139,140,141;0.5,1),e˜2=(156,158,162,166;0.5,1).In the model, the predetermined confidence levels are set as ρi=0.9, βj=0.9 and γk=0.8, respectively, where i=1, 2, 3, 4, j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and k=1, 2.In the first set of experiments, the expected value criterion-based reduction method will be used to convert a type-2 fuzzy variable into a type-1 fuzzy variable, where the generated type-1 fuzzy variable has possibility distributions with the forms given in Theorem 4.2.1. Then, tabu search algorithm will be applied to solving the corresponding mathematical model.In the algorithm, the length of the tabu tenure is a crucial parameter to determine the quality of the generated approximate optimal solutions. However, a large parameter may potentially cost too much computational time in the searching process. To obtain a satisfactory solution in an acceptable time, we set tabu length as 6 in the experiments. In addition, to show the solution characteristics with respect to different algorithmic conditions, we particularly consider two parameters in the solving process. That is, (1) “M” denotes the given iteration length when the optimal objective value does not change and (2) “N” denotes the number of elements in the neighborhood. By randomly setting these two parameters with reasonable values, we list the returned approximate optimal objectives in Table 3.In Table 3, we compare generated optimal objective values with different parameter settings. In these experiments, the relative errors among different optimal objectives are computed by(24)Relativeerror=Opt.objective−Bestopt.objectiveBestopt.objective×100%Obviously, the computational results show that relative errors of the generated optimal objective values are no more than 3.63%, and the average value and variance, respectively, are only 0.524% and 0.0121%. In particular, we find the best objective value 6 out of 10 times in the experiments. These characteristics illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the tabu search algorithm in solving expected value reduction criterion-based model.To show the detailed features of the solution searching process, we list the computational results in Fig. 8for the fourth test since it produces the best solution at iteration 27, where parameters M and N, respectively, are set as 20 and 100. Specifically, Fig. 8 demonstrates the change of the best objective values obtained up to each iteration. It is easy to see that for the initial several iterations, the best objective encountered decreases drastically. After iteration 6, the best objective changes with a fairly slow ratio, and at iteration 27, the optimal objective is found.Next, we give the generated optimal solution in Fig. 9to straightforwardly understand the transportation plan. In this solution, conveyance 1 provides transportation service for 5 OD pairs with the transportation amount 137.1, while conveyance 2 only provides transportation service for 2 OD pairs with transportation amount 121.6.In this subsection, we firstly use optimistic value criterion to reduce type-2 fuzzy parameters with different confidence level α. Then, the same algorithm is also designed to search for the corresponding optimal solutions for each model. To capture the characteristics of the optimal solutions, eight experiments with α=0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, respectively, are implemented on a personal computer with a 2.50GHz CPU and 4GB memory. In these experiments, we set the parameters in tabu search algorithm as M=20, N=100, and tabu length=6.Fig. 10is given to clearly depict the sensitivity of optimal objectives with respect to α. Obviously, as shown, the optimal objective is gradually reduced with the increase of parameter α. In particular, when α is not greater than 0.5, the curve associated with optimal objectives is an approximately linear line.The following discussion focuses on the display of approximate optimal solutions generated via the optimistic and pessimistic value criteria with the same parameters settings, where parameters M=20, N=100 and α=0.8.(I)Solution with the optimistic value reduction criterionIf we use optimistic value criterion to reduce type-2 fuzzy parameters, the generated type-1 fuzzy variables have possibility distributions with the forms in Theorem 4.2.1. Using the designed algorithm, the optimal solution is listed in Fig. 11with the optimal objective value 1153.1.Solution with the pessimistic value reduction criterionOn the other hand, if pessimistic value criterion is used to reduce type-2 fuzzy parameters, the generated type-1 fuzzy variables have possibility distributions with the forms listed in Theorem 4.2.1. Using the designed algorithm to solve the model, we give the optimal solution in Fig. 12, and the optimal objective value is 1157.7.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The solid transportation problem is an important network optimization problem in the traffic engineering. To characterize the uncertainty in the practical decision environment, this paper treated the supply capacities, demands and conveyance capacities as type-2 fuzzy variables. To give a modeling framework for optimization problems with multi-fold uncertainty, different reduction methods were proposed to transform a type-2 fuzzy variable into a type-1 fuzzy variable, including optimistic value criterion, pessimistic value criterion and expected value criterion. Then the solid transportation problem was reformulated as a chance-constrained expected value model enlightened by the credibility optimization methods. To solve the model, tabu search algorithm was employed to search an approximate optimal solution. The numerical experiments illustrated the application and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
