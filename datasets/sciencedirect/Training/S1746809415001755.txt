@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
In this paper, we propose a method to improve geometric registration of image pairs when there exits locally varying intensity distortion.The proposed method is a modification of Myronenko et al. method called RC.We used weighted residual instead of simple residual.The weight is estimated during the registration iterations.Using weighted subtraction instead of simple subtraction improve the accuracy in the presence of complex intensity distortion.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
One crucial part of an image registration algorithm is utilization of an appropriate similarity metric. For common similarity metrics such as CC or MI, it is assumed that the intensities of image pixels are independent from each other and stationary. Accepting these assumptions, one will have difficulty doing image registration in the presence of spatially varying intensity distortion. In Myronenko et al. [5] a solution based on minimization of residual complexity is introduced to solve this problem. In this work, the weakness of RC method is investigated for more complex spatially varying intensity distortions and a modification of this method is presented to improve its performance in such conditions. The proposed method reduces the error respect to the other methods. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for image registration tasks.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image registration unifies coordinates of two images belonging to the same scene but in different times, from different viewpoints or by various sensors [1]. Image registration is considered to be a major step in image processing for combining and fusing data obtained from different sources. This process has different applications in medicine, such as, change detection, robotic surgery, the investigation of growth process, the investigation of treatment process and the combination of data obtained from different sensors [1,2]. Furthermore, change detection, weather forecast or high resolution image formation can be referred to as remote sensing applications [3]. Finally, moving objects tracking and security monitoring can be mentioned in the field of machine vision.Based on the feature space, the registration algorithm can be divided into two groups, namely, area based and feature based. In the feature based methods, the steps for image registration include extracting features, obtaining correspondence between the points, and finally estimating transform function parameters. But in the area-based methods, the transforming functions parameters are estimated by maximizing a similarity function on the whole overlapping pixels of the two images and can be formulated as an optimization problem through Eq. (1).(1)τ*=argmaxτSIM(I,J(τ))where I is the reference image, J is the moving image and τ is geometrical transformation function between these two images. SIM stands for the similarity metric used in the registration algorithm [4].The registration is difficult in real images because of some reasons such as sensor's noise, change in the environmental conditions, presence of outliers and structural changes in the object of which images are taken. Illumination change in two images while varying spatially, is one of the common degradations evident in medical and remote sensing images. Most of the widely used similarity metrics (e.g. MI) rely on two basic assumptions: Independence and spatially stationary changing of intensities. Hence, they produce undesirable results in this situation. This is because some research aimed at finding proper solutions to tackle this issue more efficiency [5–8].The focus of this paper is to present a suitable solution to enhance the performance in images with more complex spatially varying intensity distortion. In the present paper, Section 2 provides an explanation about some existing approaches. Sections 3 and 4 deal with the residual complexity and the proposed method, respectively. Section 5 describes the experiments and results and Section 6 presents the conclusion.
