Complex networks are widely used to describe the structure of many complex systems in nature and society. The box-covering algorithm is widely applied to calculate the fractal dimension, which plays an important role in complex networks. However, there are two open issues in the existing box-covering algorithms. On the one hand, to identify the minimum boxes for any given size belongs to a family of Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard problems. On the other hand, there exists randomness. In this paper, a fuzzy fractal dimension model of complex networks with fuzzy sets is proposed. The results are illustrated to show that the proposed model is efficient and less time consuming.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Complex network plays more and more important role in academic researches [1–5]. It has been shown that the small-world property [6] and the scale-free property [7] are the two fundamental properties of complex networks. The small-world property reveals that the number of nodes of the complex network, denoted by N, increase exponentially with the average diameter of the network, denoted byl¯, which leads to the general understanding that complex networks are not self-similar, since self-similar requires a power-law relation between N andl¯. Recently, Song et al. found that a variety of real complex networks consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales using the box-covering algorithm [8,9]. From then on, fractal and self-similarity properties of complex networks attract much attention from many researchers [10–14,5,15].The box-covering algorithm is widely applied to calculate the fractal dimension of complex networks [9,16–18,13]. The main step in box-covering algorithm is to find the minimum number of boxes of given size to cover the nodes of the complex network. The fractal dimensions of complex networks is determined by the relationship between the minimum number of boxes and the size of the box. However, there are two main problems during the process to find the minimum number of boxes. On the one hand, how to cover a network with the fewest possible number of boxes of a given size belongs to a family of Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problems [19], which means only approximate solution can be found by an algorithm in an acceptable amount of time. On the other hand, there exists randomness [9], such as randomly ranking the nodes in a sequence or randomly selecting the node as the center, which means their results fluctuate randomly. In other words, it is necessary to apply an average process to obtain a reliable result. The averaging process needs a large amount of time consuming.Fuzzy theory is an effective tool in many fields [20–27], like to deal with uncertain information [28–33] and fractal dimension model [34]. However, best to our knowledge, the fuzzy sets is not applied in complex network. To address the open issues mentioned before. In this paper, a fuzzy fractal dimension model of complex networks with fuzzy sets is proposed. The results are shown that the proposed fuzzy fractal dimension model is efficient and less time consuming.In this section, some basic concepts of complex network, box-covering algorithm for fractal dimension of complex network and fuzzy sets are briefly introduced.For complex network G=(N, V) and N=(1, 2, …, n), V=(1, 2, …, m), where n is the total number of nodes, m is the total number of edges. G is defined as unweighted network when the cell xij(i, j=1, 2, …, n) of edge is defined as 1 if node i is connected to node j, and 0 otherwise.Shortest path is measure of finding a path between two nodes in the complex network such that the sum of values of its constitute edge is minimized [35]. For the unweighted networks, shortest path length is defined as follows.Definition 2.1the shortest path lengthDenote dijas the shortest path length between node i and node j, which satisfies(1)dij=min(xih+…+xhj)The diameter of a network is defined as:Definition 2.2the diameter of a networksLet dijbe the shortest path between node i and node j of network G=(N, V). Then the diameter of G, denoted by d, is(2)d=max(dij)The original definition of box-covering is initially proposed by Hausdorff [36,37]. It is initially applied in the complex networks by Song et al. [8,9]. For a given box size lB, a box is a set of nodes where all distances dijbetween any two nodes i and j in the box are smaller than lB. The minimum number of boxes is denote by NB, which must be covered the entire network. Finally, the fractal dimension of this network is denoted by dBand given as follows:(3)d(B)≈−lnNBlnlBThe idea of box-covering algorithm of the complex networks has three steps and shown in Fig. 1[9].Step 1: For given network G1 and box size lB. A new network G2 is obtained, in which node i is connected to node j when dij≥lB.Step 2: Greedy coloring algorithm is adopted to find the minimum number of colors to color the nodes of network G2 in which the color of each node is different from its nearest neighbors’ colors. Then a colored network G3 is obtained.Step 3: Let one color represent one box in network G4. Then, we obtain the value of NB, equals to the number of different colors.The problem of finding the minimum number of boxes in G1 was translated to a graph coloring problem in G2 in Song's box-covering algorithm. Graph coloring problem is a well-known NP-hard problem, which means only approximate solution can be found by an algorithm in an acceptable amount of time. In addition, the results of Song's box-covering algorithm depend on the original sequence of the nodes of the network. So an averaging process was needed. For more detailed information please refer to [9].In traditional two-state classifiers, where a class C is defined as a subset of the universal set X, any input pattern x∈X can either be a member or not be a member of the given class C. This property of whether or not a pattern x of the universal set belongs to the class C can be defined by a characteristic function μC: X→{0, 1} as follows: μC(x)=1 iff x∈C; μC(x)=0 otherwise. In real life situations, boundaries between the classes may be overlapping. Hence, it is uncertain whether an input pattern belongs totally to the class C. To consider such situations, in fuzzy sets the concept of the characteristic function is modified to the fuzzy membership function μC: X→[0, 1].The box-covering dimension of complex networks employed the original definition of box-covering by Hausdorff [10,13]. The fractal dimension dBfollows the relation(4)N(ɛ)≈ɛ−dBwhere N(ɛ) is the minimum number of boxes needed to cover a given network, and ɛ is the box size. The box of size ɛ is a set of nodes where the distance between any pair of nodes is less than ɛ[10], or a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the centervcis less than ɛ[13]. In practice, the fractal dimension dBcan be calculated by the following equation:(5)dB≈−ln(N(ɛ))ln(ɛ)The equation can be rewritten as:(6)dB≈ln(N(ɛ)−1)ln(ɛ)As mentioned before, N(ɛ) is the minimum number of boxes needed to cover a given network. (N(ɛ))−1 is the reciprocal of N(ɛ). (N(ɛ))−1 can be seen as the covering ability (CA) of boxes. Large value of N(ɛ) corresponds to small value of (N(ɛ))−1. That is to say, the more boxes are needed to cover the network, the less percentage of nodes of the network could be covered by a box. For example, if five boxes are needed to cover the network, then one box can cover one fifth nodes of the network. According to the idea of box covering ability, the fuzzy fractal dimension model is proposed. The general process is shown in Fig. 2.The main step in box-covering algorithm is to find the minimum number of boxes of given size to cover the nodes of the complex network, while the main step of our model is to calculate the box covering ability. Identical balls of radius ɛ are constructed around every node of the complex network, G=(N, V). The covering ability (CA) of a ball of radius ɛ for this complex network is calculated by the following equation:(7)N(ɛ)−1=1N(N−1)∑i=1N∑j=1j≠iNΩij(ɛ)Aij(ɛ)where(8)Ωij(ɛ)=1,dij≤ɛ0,otherwiseand(9)Aij(ɛ)=exp−dij2ɛ2dijis the shortest path between node i and node j. Ωij(ɛ) is the selecting function, 1 represents that the node j could be covered by the ball whose center is node i, 0 otherwise. Aij(ɛ) is a membership function, with the value change from 0 to 1, which represents the degree of how node j could be covered by the ball. The less distance from node j to the ball center node i, the higher the value is.For instance, in G1 in Fig. 1, the CA of a ball of size of radius 3 centered by node 3 is calculated as:N3(3)−1=exp−d31232+exp−d32232+exp−d34232+exp−d35232+exp−d36232=exp−1232+exp−1232+exp−1232+exp−2232+exp−3232=0.7387we obtained the CAs of other nodes in a same manner as followsN1(3)−1=0.5936N2(3)−1=0.5936N4(3)−1=0.7426N5(3)−1=0.6333N6(3)−1=0.4484Averaging these CAs, we get the CA of a ball of size of radius 3 for this complex network is N(3)−1=0.6250, which means a ball of size of radius 3 could cover 62.5% nodes of the network. In other words, 1/0.6250=1.6000 boxes are needed to cover the network. This is an average number in different cases. If the center is node 3, then, only one box is needed, if the center is node 1 or node 2, then, another box is needed to cover node 6, and so on. To get the CA is a smoothing process, the complexity reduced significantly from NP-hard problems in box-covering algorithm.Change the size of radius ɛ from 1 to half of the diameter d of the network, the corresponding covering ability (CA) of a ball of such size could be obtained. Then the fuzzy fractal dimension DFof this complex network can be calculated from(10)DF≈ln(N(ɛ)−1)ln(ɛ)The algorithm to compute the fuzzy fractal dimension DFof complex networks is illustrated in Algorithm 1.Algorithm 1Compute the fuzzy fractal dimension of complex network.Input: A complex network G of N nodes.for each ɛ in[ɛ1, ɛ2,…, ɛL](L=d/2) doN(ɛ)−1=0for each i in[1,N] dofor each j in[1,N] dofind the shortest path length dijbetween node Niand node Njifdij≤ɛthenAij=exp−dij2ɛ2N(ɛ)−1=N(ɛ)−1+Aijend ifend forend forN(ɛ)−1=N(ɛ)−1N(N−1)end forregress ln(N(ɛ)−1) vs. ln(ɛ)fit the slope of the regressed line, DFOutput: The fuzzy fractal dimension DFof complex network G.In our algorithm, only one value of the fractal dimension could be obtained and only need one experiment. In the existing box-covering algorithm [9], the results of the greedy algorithm may depend on the original coloring sequence. So, the value of the fractal dimension also depends on the original coloring sequence. In order to investigate the quality of the algorithm, the coloring sequence should be randomly reshuffled and the greedy algorithm should be applied for many times, so it takes a lot of time.
