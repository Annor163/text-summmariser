@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The objective of the present paper is to develop a four-noded quadrilateral Cosserat point element (CPE) for the numerical solution of plane strain problems in finite elasticity of orthotropic materials with general orientation and initially distorted geometry. Generally speaking, the Cosserat point approach connects the kinetic quantities to derivatives of a strain energy function and once the strain energy of the CPE has been specified, the procedure needs no integration over the element region and it ensures that the response of the CPE is hyperelastic. In the present paper a functional form for the strain energy that controls the inhomogeneous deformations and allowing for accurate modeling of distorted meshes is proposed. A number of example problems, which compare the performance of the developed quadrilateral CPE with that of other elements based on the mixed formulation, reduced integration with enhanced hourglass control, and enhanced strains/incompatible modes methods, are considered. These examples demonstrate that CPE is free of hourglass instabilities, and it is a robust user friendly element that can be used for modeling finite deformations of orthotropic elastic materials.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Renewed interest in modeling structures made out of anisotropic materials was motivated by the need for modeling biological tissues, which are reinforced by bundles, and modeling fiber reinforced rubber that can be used in the tire industry. However, the finite element method can be used for modeling both isotropic and anisotropic structures. It is well known that the Bubnov–Galerkin approach exhibits locking for bending dominated response of thin structures with poor element aspect ratios, and for nearly incompressible materials. Therefore, various element technologies including methods of mixed variational principles [27], hybrid formulation [16], reduced integration with hourglass control [3,4,17,18], enhanced assumed strains [24–26,29,5,14], and mixed-enhanced strains [11,12] were developed to overcome these deficiencies. Although each of the latter approaches overcomes one or more of the above-mentioned unphysical behaviors, they may have a number of drawbacks. For instance, one of the drawbacks of the reduced integration method with hourglass control is the difficulty in determining stabilization parameters in the hourglass scheme, and their possible unphysical influence on the solution. The elements based on the enhanced strain technique can exhibit unphysical hourglassing in regions experiencing combined high compression with bending. Furthermore, it was shown in Jabareen and Rubin [7] that some of these improved element formulations in commercial codes can exhibit inelastic response, even though they attempt to model a hyperelastic material with a strain energy function.Bearing in mind the deficiencies of the above-mentioned finite element technologies, the emerging need for modeling structures made out of anisotropic materials sets a challenge to the scientific and engineering communities. Recently, a novel finite element technology based on the theory of a Cosserat point [19–21] was developed and applied in the formulation of a 3-D brick element for the numerical solution of dynamic problems for nonlinear hyperelastic materials [15]. By way of background, the kinematics of the brick (CPE) are characterized by eight element director vectors and the kinetics propose eight balance laws of director momentum to determine the dynamic response of the element. A novel feature of the CPE is that the element is considered to be a structure with a response characterized by its strain energy. The nodal forces are related to derivatives of the strain energy function through algebraic relations in a similar manner to the relationship of the stress to derivatives of the strain energy function in the full three-dimensional theory of hyperelastic materials.The objective of the present paper is to generalize the CPE formulation presented in Jabareen et al. [10] by making it capable for analyzing general elastic orthotropic materials under finite deformations with initially distorted meshes. In particular, in Jabareen et al. [10] the coefficients of the strain energy function, which controls the response to inhomogeneous deformations, were determined by limiting attention to a rectangular parallelepiped, and it was found that the formulation therein suffers from undesirable sensitivity to initially distorted meshes. Furthermore, it was shown by Jabareen and Rubin [8,9] that generalizing the CPE to accurately model general element shapes is an extreme challenge, and therefore, the development presented in the present paper is focused on the two-dimensional plane strain case. However, the resulting two-dimensional CPE should have a wider range of applications, such as within realistic two-dimensional engineering problems.An outline of the present paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background of the two-dimensional CPE. Section 3 describes the procedure for determining the constitutive coefficients in the strain energy function for the inhomogeneous deformations, and Section 4 discusses the formulation of the numerical solution of plane strain problems using the CPE. Section 5 presents a number of plain strain examples that demonstrate the response of the developed quadrilateral CPE and comparing it to different finite elements using the commercial finite package ABAQUS. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions.The CPE for a plane strain quadrilateral element is a continuum model which characterizes the response of a finite structure that occupies the region P, which is a right cylinder with a quadrilateral cross-section and unit thickness (see Fig. 1). Unless otherwise stated, all vectors and tensors are two-dimensional with components in thee1–e2plane associated with the fixed right-handed orthonormal rectangular Cartesian base vectorsei(i=1,2,3).The locationX⁎of a material point in the stress-free reference configuration of a quadrilateral CPE and the locationx⁎at time t of the same material point in the present configuration admit the representations(1)X⁎=∑i=03Ni(θ1,θ2)Di,x⁎=∑i=03Ni(θ1,θ2)di(t),where{Di,di}(i=0,1,2,3)are, respectively, the reference and present element director vectors,θi(i=1,2)are convected coordinates having the ranges−1/2≤θi≤1/2, andNi(i=0,1,2,3)are the bilinear shape functions defined by(2)N0=1,N1=θ1,N2=θ2,N3=θ1θ2.Furthermore, the reference element directors{D1,D2}and the present element directors{d1,d2}are restricted to be linearly independent so that(3)D1/2=D1×D2·e3>0,d1/2=d1×d2·e3>0.With reference to Fig. 1 it follows that the reference nodal directorsD¯i(i=0,…,3)and their present counterpartsd¯i(i=0,…,3), which locate the nodes of the quadrilateral in the reference and present configurations, respectively, are defined by the values of the nodal position vectors such that(4)D¯i=X⁎(θ1=θi1,θ2=θi2),d¯i=x⁎(θ1=θi1,θ2=θi2,t),where{θi1,θi2}are the values of the convected coordinates at the ith node and are recorded in Table 1. The reference,Di, and the present,di, element director vectors can be written in terms of the reference,D¯i, and the present,d¯i, nodal director vectors, respectively, by using the expressions in (4) such that(5)Di=∑j=03AijD¯j,di=∑j=03Aijd¯j(i=0,1,2,3),where the constant matrix Aijis defined by(6)[Aij]=14[+1+1+1+1−2+2+2−2−2−2+2+2+4−4+4−4].The deformation of the quadrilateral CPE is characterized by a tensor F associated with homogeneous deformation, and one vectorβassociated with inhomogeneous deformation, such that(7)F=∑i=12di⊗Di,β=F−1d3−D3,whereDi(i=1,2)are the reciprocal vectors ofDi(i=1,2)and ⊗ denotes the tensor product. Moreover, it is possible to show that the pointwise two-dimensional deformation gradientF˜⁎can be written in terms of the quantities F andβsuch that(8)F˜⁎=∑i=12gi⊗Gi=F(I+∑i=12β⊗N,i3Gi),J˜⁎=det(F˜⁎),where{Gi,gi}(i=1,2)are, respectively, the contravariant base vectors of the reference configuration and the covariant base vectors of the present configuration, and I is the two-dimensional identity tensor in the plane of plane strain. Then,F¯can be defined as the volume average of the two-dimensional deformation gradientF˜⁎(just as for the brick CPE[13])(9)F¯=1V∫P0F˜⁎dV⁎=F(I+β⊗V),J¯=det(F¯),where P0 characterizes the reference region occupied by the element, dV⁎ is the reference volume element per unit depth, and the quantities{V,V}for the plane strain case are given by(10)V=∫P0dV⁎=D1/2,V=1V∑i=12∫P0N,i3GidV⁎=0.In this regard, for the plane strain quadrilateral CPE, the volume average deformation gradient coincides with the homogeneous deformation gradient. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that within the context of the standard finite elements, with a fully integrated scheme (Bubnov–Galerkin approach), the pointwise deformation gradientF˜⁎and its determinant are used to determine the stresses at the gauss points and the element internal nodal forces. Alternatively, in the Cosserat point approach the volume average deformation gradientF¯and its determinant will be used for the determination of the element internal nodal forces (similar to the underintegrated formulation of finite elements).Finally, it is convenient to introduce the inhomogeneous strains bithat characterize the two bending modes existing in two dimensional elements(11a,b)b1=β·D1,b2=β·D2.The weak equations of the balance of linear momentum are derived by following the standard Bubnov–Galerkin procedure, in which the strong form of the equation of balance of linear momentum (e.g. [6]) is multiplied by the shape functions Ni, and then the result is integrated over the region P of the element. In particular, the weak equations of balance of linear momentum read(12)d2dt2[∑j=03myijdj]=mbi+mi−ti(i=0,1,2,3)witht0=0,where m is the mass of the CPE, yijare the constant director inertia coefficients,mbiare the director couples due to body forces,miare the director couples due to surface tractions on the boundaries of the CPE, andtiare the intrinsic director couples, which require constitutive equation. The expressions for the aforementioned quantities{myij,mbi,mi,ti}are given by(13a–e)myij=myji=∫Pρ⁎NiNjdv⁎(i,j=0,1,2,3),mbi=∫PNiρ⁎b⁎dv⁎,mJi=∫∂PJNiT˜⁎n⁎da⁎(J=1,2,3,4)mi=∑J=14mJi,ti=∑m=12∫PN,mig−1/2t⁎mdv⁎.In these equationsdv⁎=g1/2dθ1dθ2is the volume element per unit depth, da⁎ is the area element per unit depth in the present configuration,n⁎is the unit outward normal vector to the surface∂P,T˜⁎is the two-dimensional pointwise Cauchy stress, and the mass m is defined by the condition thaty00=1. Furthermore, it can be shown that the balance of angular momentum is satisfied provided that the tensor T is symmetric(14)T=d−1/2∑i=13ti⊗di=TT.Next, for implementing the Cosserat point element in standard finite element codes the balance laws (12) of the Cosserat theory should be written in the nodal forms so that(15)d2dt2[∑j=03my¯ijd¯j]=mb¯i+m¯i−t¯i(i=0,1,2,3),where{y¯ij,b¯i,m¯i,t¯i}are, respectively, the nodal director inertias, the specific nodal body forces, the nodal contact forces, and the nodal internal forces, defined by(16)y¯ij=∑r=03∑s=03AriyrsAsj,b¯i=∑r=03Aribrm¯i=∑r=03Arimr,t¯i=∑r=03Aritr.The main difference between the Bubnov–Galerkin approach and the CPE approach is the procedure for determining the constitutive equations for the intrinsic director couplesti. In the Bubnov–Galerkintiare determined by (13e), while in the CPE approachtiare determined by constitutive equations. Specifically, the specific (per unit mass) strain energy functionΣof the CPE can be proposed by using the idea of separating it into two parts, where the first partΣ⁎is associated with the three-dimensional material and the second partΨis associated with inhomogeneous deformations such that(17)Σ=Σ⁎(C¯¯)+Ψ(b1,b2,H1,H2,D12,K˜ijkl⁎),C¯¯=F¯TF¯+e3⊗e3.A simple three dimensional strain energy function for an orthotropic elastic material can be obtained by assuming that the strain energy function depends quadratically on the Lagrangian strain tensor. However, this simple three dimensional strain energy function exhibits unphysical deficiencies (e.g. zero cross-sectional area in extension, finite cross-sectional area at full compression, and stress softening in compression (see [10])), and therefore, it is not appropriate for modeling the finite deformation response of elastic orthotropic materials. Here, the strain energyΣ⁎proposed by Rubin and Jabareen [22,23], which is valid for finite deformation of orthotropic materials, is adopted. In the work of Rubin and Jabareen [22,23], the strain energy function depends on a set of invariants of the deformation and specified by(18)2ρ0⁎Σ⁎=∑i=13Ki(βi−2)+∑i=46Kiβi+2K7(J¯−1−ln(J¯)),whereKi(i=1,2,…,7)are material parameters that can be expressed in terms of the stiffness tensor of a general orthotropic linear elastic solid(K˜ijkl⁎)(see [22,23]), andβi(i=1,2,…,6)are the invariants of the deformation defined in Rubin and Jabareen [23]. Regarding the strain energy associated with inhomogeneous deformations, it was assumed to depend on the inhomogeneous strains{b1,b2}, the element׳s dimensions{H1,H2}, the metric D12, and the components of stiffness tensorK˜ijkl⁎. Specifically, the quantities{H1,H2,D12}are given by(19)H1=∥D1∥,H2=∥D2∥,D12=D1∥D1∥·D2∥D2∥.Furthermore, it can be shown that this model of the CPE will reproduce all two dimensionally homogeneous deformations exactly if and only if the following restrictions are satisfied:(20)∂Ψ∂bi=0wheneverbi=0This condition ensures that the CPE satisfies a nonlinear form of the patch test. Therefore the strain energy function associated with the inhomogeneous deformationsΨhas to be at least a quadratic function of the vectors biin order to automatically satisfy (20). As a special case the strain energyΨis taken to be a quadratic function of bionly of the form(21)mΨ=V2∑i=12∑j=12Bijbibj,Bij=Bij(H1,H2,D12,K˜ijkl⁎)whereBij=Bjiis a constant symmetric matrix. This functional form automatically satisfies the restrictions (20) so the resulting CPE satisfies the nonlinear patch test for all reference geometries and all nonlinear anisotropic strain energy functionsΣ⁎.Now, within the context of the purely mechanical theory, the rate of dissipation of hyperelastic material vanishes and is given by(22)d1/2D=d1/2T:D+FTt3·β̇−mΣ̇=0,where D is the rate of deformation tensor and it is defined by the symmetric part ofL=ḞF−1, and(:)denotes the inner product between two second order tensors. Using the representation (17), and using (22) with the assumption that T andtiare independent of the rate of deformation D and the rate of the inhomogeneous deformation measuresβ, it follows that(23)d1/2T=V∑i=16KiF¯B^iF¯T+VK7(J¯−1)I,t3=V(B11b1+B12b2)d1+V(B21b1+B22b2)d2ti=(d1/2T−t3⊗d3)di(i=1,2),where the two dimensional tensorsB^iare defined by(24)B^i=Bi−(Bi:(e3⊗e3))(e3⊗e3),Bi=∂βi(C⁎)∂C⁎|C⁎=C¯¯,withC⁎being a general three dimensional right Green–Cauchy tensor.The constitutive coefficients{B11,B12,B22}in (21) are determined by matching solutions of the linearized equations for the CPE with exact solutions of the linear theory of elasticity for special element shape. Specifically, the special element shape (see Fig. 2) has a rhombic cross-section and defined as follows:(25)D1=H1e1,D2=H2(D12e1+1−D122e2),D0=D3=0.For a general quadrilateral element, it is possible to define two right-handed orthonormal base vectors such that(26)e1′(1)=D1∥D1∥,e2′(1)=D2∥D2∥,e1′(2)=D2∥D2∥,e2′(2)=D1∥D1∥,and in particular, for the special element shape defined by (25), the two right-handed orthonormal base vectors become(27)e1′(1)=e1,e2′(1)=e2,e1′(2)=D12e1+1−D122e2,e2′(2)=−1−D122e1+D12e2.Now, the position vectorX⁎that locates a material point in the reference configuration and its componentsXi⁎′(m)can be expressed explicitly in terms of the convected coordinates θisuch that(28)X⁎=θ1D1+θ2D2,Xi⁎′(m)=X⁎·ei′(m)(i,m=1,2).Here, the constitutive coefficients are determined so that the CPE produces exact solutions for two pure bending fields (see Fig. 2) applied to the special quadrilateral element. To this end, letu⁎(m)be the displacements andT⁎(m)the stresses associated with the two pure bending solutions (m=1,2), and letu⁎andT⁎be the displacement and stress, respectively, associated with the combined solution(29a–d)u⁎=∑m=12u⁎(m),u⁎(m)=ui⁎′(m)ei′(m),T⁎=∑m=12T⁎(m),T⁎(m)=Tij⁎′(m)ei′(m)⊗ej′(m),where{ui⁎′(m),Tij⁎′(m)}are the components of the displacement vectoru⁎(m)and the two-dimensional stress tensorT⁎(m), respectively, relative toei′(m)and are given by(30a–d)u1⁎′(m)=γ(m)K^1111⁎′(m)(X1⁎′(m)X2⁎′(m)−α1112⁎′(m)2X2⁎′(m)X2⁎′(m))+C1X2⁎′(m)+C2,u2⁎′(m)=−γ(m)2K^1111⁎′(m)(X1⁎′(m)X1⁎′(m)+α1122⁎′(m)X2⁎′(m)X2⁎′(m))−C1X1⁎′(m)+C3,T11⁎′(m)=γ(m)X2⁎′(m),T22⁎′(m)=T12⁎′(m)=0.The scalarsγ(m)(m=1,2)in (30) control the pure bending fields, and the integration constants{C1,C2,C3}control the rigid body motion. Also, the coefficients{K^1111⁎′(m),α1122⁎′(m),α1112⁎′(m)}are defined by(31)K^1111⁎′(m)=(K1111⁎′(m)K2222⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K1111⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m)−K1122⁎′(m)K1122⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K1112⁎′(m)K1112⁎′(m)K2222⁎′(m)+2K1122⁎′(m)K1112⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m))/(K2222⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K2212⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m)),α1122⁎′(m)=K1122⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K1112⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m)K2222⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K2212⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m),α1112⁎′(m)=K1112⁎′(m)K2222⁎′(m)−K1122⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m)K2222⁎′(m)K1212⁎′(m)−K2212⁎′(m)K2212⁎′(m),whereKijkl⁎′(m)are the components of the fourth order stiffness tensorKrelative to the base vectorsei′, and can be expressed in terms of the components ofKrelative to the base vectorsei(i.e.Kijkl⁎) through the following transformation:(32)Kijkl⁎′(m)=Air(m)Ajs(m)Aku(m)Alv(m)Krsuv⁎,Aij(m)=ei′(m)·ej.The componentsKijkl⁎of the stiffness tensor can be related to a general anisotropic material in the planee1–e2, and therefore, it can be concluded that the strain energy function (21) is suitable for modeling general anisotropic material in the planee1–e2. However, for orthotropic material with material orthotropy defined by the vectorsMi(see Fig. 1), the componentsKijkl⁎are defined by(33)Kijkl⁎=A˜riA˜sjA˜ukA˜vlK˜rsuv⁎,A˜ij=ei·Mj.The approximation of displacement field associated with the kinematic assumptions (1) is not general enough to reproduce the exact solution of plane strain pure bending (30). To this end, it is necessary to develop expressions for the valuesδi⁎(i=0,…,3)of the element director displacementsδi=di−Di(i=0,…,3)which are consistent with the exact solution of plane strain pure bending. Motivated by the work of Nadler and Rubin [15] and Jabareen and Rubin [8], and focusing on the special element shape in (25), the expressions ofδi⁎(i=0,…,3)associated with an exact displacement fieldu⁎in (30a) and (30b) are defined by the integrals(34)δ0⁎=1V∫P0u⁎dV,δi⁎=1V∫P0∂u⁎∂θidV(i=1,2),δ3⁎=1V∫P0∂2u⁎∂θ1∂θ2dV,where the reference volumeV=H1H21−D122of the special element is evaluated by (10a). Substituting the solution of the pure bending fields (i.e. Eqs. (29a), (29b), (30a) and (30b)) into (34) and appropriately choosing the integration constants{C1,C2,C3}so that the rigid body motion is eliminated, yield the nonzeroδi⁎that is given by(35)δ3⁎=H1H21−D122γ(1)K^1111⁎′(1)e1−H1H2(γ(2)K^1111⁎′(2)+D12γ(1)K^1111⁎′(1))e2.Next, setting the director displacementsδiequal toδi⁎and linearizing the inhomogeneous measure of the deformationβ, it can be shown that the linearized form of the inhomogeneous strains in (11) is(36)b1=+H21−D122(γ(1)K^1111⁎′(1)+D12γ(2)K^1111⁎′(2)),b2=−H11−D122(γ(2)K^1111⁎′(2)+D12γ(1)K^1111⁎′(1)).Also, in the absence of director couples associated with body forcesbiand linearizing the expressions of the couples due to external forcesmigiven in (13c) and (13d) and the expressions of the intrinsic couplestigiven in (23), the equilibrium equations (12) become(37)m3−t3=0,m3=1−D12212[(H22γ(1)−D12H12γ(2))e1−1−D122H12γ(2)e2]t3=V(B11b1+B12b2)D1+V(B21b1+B22b2)D2.Finally, solving (37) yields the following constitutive coefficients:(38)B11=K^1111⁎′(1)12+D122H12H22K^1111⁎′(2)12,B12=B21=D12H2H1K^1111⁎′(1)12+D12H1H2K^1111⁎′(2)12B22=K^1111⁎′(2)12+D122H22H12K^1111⁎′(1)12.The developed quadrilateral CPE presented in the previous sections can be used to obtain the numerical solution of general two-dimensional plane strain structures made out of orthotropic material and undergo finite deformations. Similar to the standard finite element procedure, a given topology of a body is modeled as a collection of M elements, which interact through their common boundaries and are characterized by N global nodes located relative to a fixed origin. The kinematics and kinetics of the Ith (I=1,…,M) CPE are characterized by the nodal equations (15) with a subscript I added to the left of each quantity and with no implied summation on repeated upper cased indices. Using the well known assembly operatorA, the global equations of motion can be written in the following compact matrix notation:(39)Md¨⁎+Fint.⁎−Fext.⁎=0,whered⁎={d¯1,…,d¯N}Tis the global position vector of the N nodes,Mis the global mass matrix,Fint.⁎andFext.⁎are the global internal and external nodal forces, respectively. Specifically, the quantities{M,Fint.⁎,Fext.⁎}are defined by(40)M=AMI=1MI,Fint.⁎=AMI=1Fint.I,Fext.⁎=AMI=1(Fext.,bI+Fext.,cI),[MI]ij=mIIy¯ij,Fint.I={t¯0I,…,t¯3I}T,Fext.,bI={mIIb¯0,…,mIIb¯3}T,Fext.,cI={m¯0I,…,m¯3I}T,whereMIis the element mass matrix with the components[MI]ij, and{Fext.,b⁎,Fext.,c⁎}are the external nodal forces due to body forces and surface tractions, respectively. In addition, the quantities{y¯ijI,t¯iI,m¯iI}are given in (16).The developed four noded quadrilateral orthotropic CPE with two translational degrees of freedom at each node was implemented into the commercial finite element package [1] through the user subroutineUEL. Specifically, ABAQUS calls theUELsubroutine with a guess for the nodal displacements of the element and theUELsubroutine provides ABAQUS with the element residual vector (RHS) as well as the element tangent stiffness matrix (AMATRX) of the governing equations. Furthermore, the predictions of the developed Cosserat point element (CPE) were compared with three quadrilateral plane strain element formulations in ABAQUS. Predictions based on the selective reduced integration element (CPE4) are denoted by (AB1), those based on the incompatible modes element (CPE4I) are denoted by (AB2), and those based on the reduced integration (one integration point) element with enhanced hourglass control (CPE4R) are denoted by (AB3). Therefore, for ABAQUS׳s elements (i.e. CPE4, CPE4I, and CPE4R), the strain energy function (18) was implemented in ABAQUS using the user subroutineUMAT. Specifically, in theUMATuser subroutine, ABAQUS provides the subroutine with the deformation gradient, and theUMATthen provides ABAQUS with the Cauchy stress tensor as well as with the spatial tangent moduli tensor consistent with the objective Jaumann–Zaremba stress rate.In order to examine the accuracy and the robustness of the developed quadrilateral CPE formulation, a number of example problems are considered. For these examples, the material parameters of the strain energy function (18) are specified by(41)K1=K2=K3=μ2,μ=600MPa,K4=K5=K6=0,K7=K,K=1000MPa,n01=2n0,n02=n03=−n0,n0=−1.Specifically, the material parameters given in (41) characterize a transversely isotropic material, where the direction of the anisotropy (fibers) is parallel to the vectorM1, which is specified by(42)M1=cos(θ)e1+sin(θ)e2,where the fiber orientation angle θ is defined as the angle between the direction of the anisotropy and the unit vectore1. In addition, for the material parameters given in (41), the stiffness coefficientsK˜ijkl⁎are(43)K˜1111⁎=43μ(n0−1)2+K,K˜2222⁎=K˜3333⁎=43μ(n02+n0+1)+K,K˜1122⁎=K˜1133⁎=23μ(2n02−n0−1)+K,K˜2233⁎=23μ(2n02+2n0−1)+K,K˜1212⁎=K˜1313⁎=K˜2323⁎=μ.The patch test is considered as a fundamental test in finite element technology, and has been used for over five decades as a condition for convergence of finite elements as well as a verification tool for algorithms (see for example [28,2,30]). Different variants of the patch test have been suggested by different research studies. Two of them will be presented in this paper. To this end, a square with edge length L = 100.0mm that is meshed with five distorted elements is considered (see Fig. 3a). The reference locationsXI(I=1,…,8)of the square׳s nodes in Fig. 3a are specified by(44)X1=0,X2=Le1,X3=Le2,X4=Le1+Le2X5=0.25Le1+0.25Le2,X6=0.75Le1+0.35Le2X7=0.35Le1+0.65Le2,X8=0.65Le1+0.75Le2.Although Nadler and Rubin [15] showed that the CPE theory analytically satisfies a nonlinear form of the patch test, the objective of the following example is to demonstrate that the developed quadrilateral CPE formulation satisfies a nonlinear form of the patch test in a numerical manner.This test is defined by applying external forces at the boundary nodes, which produce a constant stress state. An element technology passes this type of patch test when the predicted displacement fields are linear and coincide with the theoretical solution. In particular, the square described in Fig. 3a is subjected to external forces at nodes 2, 3 and 4, and boundary conditions are set so that a rigid body motion is eliminated as depicted in Fig. 3b.Fig. 4a shows the normalized applied force,P¯=P/P0, versus the normalized horizontal displacement of node 4,u¯41=u41/Lfor fiber orientation angleθ=45°. It can be seen that the predictions of the Cosserat point element CPE, the selective reduced integration element AB1, and the reduced integration element with enhanced hourglass control AB3 coincide with the theoretical solution for both tension and compression. The prediction of the incompatible mode element AB2 coincides with theoretical solution for tension, while it ceases to converge in compression. These results demonstrate that the CPE, AB1 and AB3 elements satisfy the force patch test, while the AB2 element does not satisfy this test.This test is achieved by applying linear displacements field on the square׳s external nodes. An element technology passes this type of patch test when the displacements and stresses at the internal nodes correspond with the theoretical solution. In particular, the prescribed displacements at the exterior nodes are depicted in Fig. 3c and are specified by(45)u1=u3=0,u2=u4=(λ−1)Le1,where λ is the applied uniaxial stretch. Additionally, the horizontal component of the exact displacement of the interior node 5 in Fig. 3a,u51⁎, and the error E51 in the axial component of node 5, u51, calculated by the different element formulations are given by(46)u51⁎=(λ−1)L4,E51=u51−u51⁎|u51⁎|.Fig. 4b shows the errors predicted by the CPE, AB1, AB2 and AB3 elements for different values of applied uniaxial stretch. It can be seen that the predicted errors by the Cosserat point element CPE, the selective reduced integration element AB1 and the reduced integration element with enhanced hourglass control AB3 vanish for all the values of the applied stretch. However, the errors predicted by the incompatible modes element AB2 become nonzero in both tension and compression. Specifically, the solution predicted by the AB2 element exhibits instabilities in tension that lead to nonzero error, while in compression AB2 ceased to converge. These results demonstrate that the CPE, AB1 and AB3 elements satisfy the displacement patch test, while the AB2 does not satisfy this test.The objective of this test is to check whether or not an element formulation of a hyperelastic material exhibits hyperelastic response [7]. In this regard, it should be noted that only a single calculation is needed to prove that an element formulation is not hyperelastic.To this end, consider a single quadrilateral element which is a square in its reference configuration with edges of length L = 1m and fiber orientation angleθ=45°. The two nodes located byX1andX2are fixed, the nodeX3is free, and the nodeX4is deformed to the locationx4by the displacementu4(47)x4=X4+u4,where the displacement vectoru4is characterized by a sequence of straight line segments that connect the end pointsA−Dshown in Fig. 5and which are specified by(48)uA=0,uB=−βe1,uC=−βe1−βe2,uD=−βe2,β=0.25m.To quantify the errors associated with path-dependency it is convenient to introduceWA=WABCDAas the work done on the element in a single closed cycle of deformation following the deformation path ABCDA,WC1=WABCas the work done during the deformation path ABC, andWC2=WADCas the work done during the deformation path ADC. Furthermore, the relative error for a closed deformation path associated with WAand the relative error associated with the two different paths to the point C are denoted by EAand EC, respectively, and defined by(49)EA=WAWC1,EC=WC2WC1−1.Furthermore, the total external work done on the element is given by(50)W=∫f4·u̇4dt,where the trapezoidal rule was used to integrate (50) by dividing each segment of deformation into N=500 equal steps to ensure accuracy.Table 2presents the results for the CPE, AB1, AB2, and AB3 elements. The theoretical values of{EA,EC}for the CPE should be zero, since the nodal forces in the CPE are determined by derivatives of a strain energy function. Therefore, the numerical values for the Cosserat solution in Table 2 represent the combined numerical error due to the convergence criterion used to satisfy equilibrium, machine precision and numerical integration of the work done using the trapezoidal rule. Furthermore, the results in Table 2 indicate that the element AB1 produces hyperelastic path-independent response, while the elements AB2 and AB3 exhibit inelastic response indicated by the nonzero values of{EA,EC}. The negative value of EApredicted by the element AB2 indicates that the element generates energy, while the positive value of EApredicted by the element AB3 indicates that the element dissipates energy. Fig. 6shows the residual element distortion after 10 deformation cycles of ABCDA predicted by the elements AB2 and AB3, which indicates that those elements predict hypoelastic response. It is emphasized that the displacements in Fig. 6 have not been enhanced.The objective of this example is to examine the performance of the developed CPE for modeling thin structures with regular and irregular meshes and general orientation of the directions of the material orthotropy. Specifically, Fig. 7a shows a thin cantilever beam with the dimensions(51)L1=200.0mm,L2=10.0mm,which is fully clamped at its endX1⁎=0and is subjected to a uniform shear stress f applied in thee2direction to its endX1⁎=L1. The irregular element mesh is obtained by distorting the middle cross-section in its reference configuration using the parameter a (see Fig. 7a). For the irregularity parameter a=0, the elements are regular rectangular quadrilaterals and fora≠0, the elements have irregular shapes with the parametera¯=a/L2defining the normalized element irregularity. The beam is meshed with10nelements on each side of the distorted cross-section in thee1direction and n elements in thee2direction. Fig. 7b and c shows two meshes with irregular (distorted) elements considered here. The error EA2 in the vertical displacement uA2 of the point A (see Fig. 7a) is defined by the following equation:(52)EA2=uA2−uA2⁎|uA2⁎|,whereuA2⁎is the displacement component predicted by the CPE for the most refined mesh (n=20). In this regard, the value ofuA2⁎is considered to be a reference solution used to define the error EA2 of other elements and meshes. Specifically, the converged valuesuA2⁎predicted by the CPE and associated with the most refined mesh {400, 20} and for two angles of material orthotropyθ=0°andθ=45°are given by(53)uA2⁎=0.13305mmforf=0.001N/mm2andθ=0°uA2⁎=0.17738mmforf=0.001N/mm2andθ=45°Fig. 8checks standard convergence of the elements CPE, AB2 and AB3 with mesh refinement in the two directions, defined by{20n,n}, for regular and irregular meshes and for two angles of material orthotropyθ=0°andθ=45°. Specifically, Fig. 8a and b demonstrates that the CPE produces results similar to those of the AB2 for regular meshes, and in particular indicates that the CPE formulation is suitable for modeling thin structures with general orientation of material orthotropy. For irregular meshes with normalized element irregularitya¯=5.0and a coarse mesh with one element through the beam׳s thickness (n=1), Fig. 8c and d shows that the CPE is less accurate than AB2. However, the prediction of the CPE becomes close to the prediction of AB2 for a finer mesh with two elements through the beam׳s thickness (n=2), and the two elements predict the same error for meshes withn≥3. The AB3 element predicts very large errors in comparison with the CPE and AB2 elements and exhibits slow convergence for both regular and irregular meshes with angle of material orthotropyθ=0°. For the case of angle of material orthotropyθ=45°and irregular mesh, the AB3 element behaves slightly better than the CPE element.Fig. 9a and b shows the error (52) as a function of the normalized irregularity parametera¯predicted by the CPE, AB2 and AB3 for two meshes. Ideally, the response should be nearly insensitive to the value of mesh distortion. For the coarsest mesh with only one element through the beam׳s thickness, Fig. 9a shows that the error predicted by the CPE increases with increased distortion, with a maximum error of approximately 8% for the largest value of normalized irregularity (a¯=5.0). However, by refining the mesh and having two elements through the beam׳s thickness (Fig. 9b), the errors predicted by the CPE are similar to those predicted by the AB2 element. It is interesting to note from Fig. 9a and b that the error predicted by AB2 for the largest value of normalized irregularity (a¯=5.0) changes sign and even increases when the mesh is refined to have two elements through the beam׳s thickness. In contrast, the error predicted by the CPE decreases with mesh refinement, as expected. The element AB3 exhibits a similar sensitivity to mesh distortion like the CPE for coarse meshes, while the predicted errors by AB3 for regular meshes are larger than those predicted by the CPE.Fig. 10a shows the displacement component uA2 of point A in thee2direction as a function of the angle of material orthotropy θ for the most refined mesh {400, 20}. The angle θ varies fromθ=0°in which the fibers are in thee1direction and characterizes the stiffest case toθ=90°in which the fibers are in thee2direction and characterizes the most compliant case. Furthermore, the error in uA2 is defined in a similar manner to (52), with the reference solutionuA2⁎taken as that predicted by the CPE for each value of θ with the most refined mesh {400, 20}. Fig. 10b shows the errors of the predictions of the CPE, AB2 and AB3 for irregular mesh with the largest normalized irregularity (a¯=5.0) and two elements through the beam׳s thickness ({40, 2}). It can be seen that both CPE and AB2 predict small errors for the whole range of θ, while AB3 predicts large errors that vary from≈8%to≈−15%. Those results indicate that the element AB3 is inappropriate for modeling thin structures with bending dominated deformations.The objective of this example is to examine the performance of the developed CPE for large deformations of a thin beam. Specifically, the cantilever beam with the dimensions specified in (51) is subjected to a uniform follower shear loadf0=50N/mm2on its endX1=L1.Fig. 11shows the normalized shear load versus the normalized axial displacement of point A (see Fig. 7a) for two coarse meshes (n = 2, n = 4) and two elementsCPE,AB2. Furthermore, the converged CPE solution denoted as CPE⁎ using the refined mesh (n=20) is also shown. It can be seen in Fig. 11a that for the mesh with n=2, the solutions obtained by both elements deviate from the converged solution for large values of applied shear load. This deviation can be attributed to the fact that the beam becomes curvy at large value of applied shear load (see Fig. 12), and as a result the mesh effectively becomes coarse. The solutions obtained by both elements for n=4 are closer to the converged solution as it can be seen from Fig. 11b. Furthermore, the solution based on AB2 ceased to converge for loads greater than the one associated with the point denoted by the symbolxin Fig. 11. It should be emphasized that the load level at which the AB2 ceased to converge decreases with mesh refinement. This result indicates that the CPE is more robust than AB2 for modeling finite deformation of thin structures.Finally, the deformed shape of the beam under the final load level is shown in Fig. 12.The objective of this example is to examine the accuracy and the robustness of the developed CPE for large deformation of two dimensional problems. Specifically, Fig. 13shows a sketch of a block that has length L1 and height L2, and the cylindrical punch that has a radius R specified by(54)L1=4.0m,L2=2.0m,R=1.0m.The bottom(X2⁎=0)and exterior lateral surfaces(X1⁎=0andL1)of the block remain in contact and slide freely on smooth rigid planes. The block׳s top surface(X2⁎=L2)is traction-free except for those points that are in contact with the rigid cylindrical punch. The rigid cylinder can only move vertically in thee2direction with maximum applied displacementδ=−1.25m. The contact between the cylinder and the block was defined as rough so it enforces no sliding between the block and the cylindrical punch. The angle of material orthotropy is given byθ=45°. The entire block is meshed by{4n,2n}with4nsegments in the horizontal direction and 2n segments in the vertical direction.The normalized force(F¯=F/F0,F0=−7500.0MN/m)applied by the cylinder in the negative directione2at point A versus the normalized applied displacement of the rigid cylinder(u¯A2=uA2/δ,δ=−1.25m)is given for a coarse mesh {16, 8} (n=4) in Fig. 14for four elements, namely CPE, AB1, AB2, and AB3. The results of the CPE for the most refined mesh {80, 40} (n=20), denoted as CPE⁎, are also shown in the same figure. It can be seen that the predictions of the CPE, AB1 and AB3 are close to those of the refined solution CPE⁎. The solution predicted by the element AB2 departs from the other solutions atu¯A2≈0.4and ceases to converge due to hourglass instability atu¯A2≈0.512. The deformed configurations predicted by the CPE and AB2 are given in Fig. 15a and b, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 15a that the left and right upper corners undergo different vertical displacements due to the fact that the principal directions of the material orthotropy are rotated in thee1–e2plane. Furthermore, Fig. 15b illustrates the hourglass mode of deformation predicted by the AB2.Finally, the invariant β4 in (18) is defined as the square of the cosine of the angle between two material fibers, which were orthogonal and parallel to the principal directions of orthotropy in the reference configuration. Fig. 16a presents the normalized angle between two material fibers at a material point located at the middle point of the block (X1=L1/2,X2=L2/2) versus the normalized applied displacement of the rigid cylinder. It can be seen that the angle varies from 90° to≈25°. The contour plot of the values of the invariant β4 is presented in Fig. 16b, which illustrates that the region under the rigid cylinder undergoes the largest change in the angle between the material fibers.
