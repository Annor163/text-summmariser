@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, the problem of designing weighted fusion robust time-varying Kalman predictors is considered for multisensor time-varying systems with uncertainties of noise variances. Using the minimax robust estimation principle and the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) rule, based on the worst-case conservative system with the conservative upper bounds of noise variances, the local and five weighted fused robust time-varying Kalman predictors are designed, which include a robust weighted measurement fuser, three robust weighted state fusers, and a robust covariance intersection (CI) fuser. Their actual prediction error variances are guaranteed to have the corresponding minimal upper bounds for all admissible uncertainties of noise variances. Their robustness is proved based on the proposed Lyapunov equation approach. The concept of the robust accuracy is presented, and the robust accuracy relations are proved. The corresponding steady-state robust local and fused Kalman predictors are also presented, and the convergence in a realization between the time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman predictors is proved by the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method and the dynamic variance error system analysis (DVESA) method. Simulation results show the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The fundamental problem of the multisensor information fusion estimation is how to combine the local state estimators or local measurement data to obtain a fused state estimator, whose accuracy is higher than that of the each local estimator [1]. In the past three decades, with the development of the information sciences and high technologies, the multisensor information fusion has received great attention and has been applied to many fields including guidance, defense, robotics, navigation, target tracking, signal processing, GPS positioning, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), communication, command, control, computer and intelligent systems (C4I). There exist two basic fusion methods: One is the centralized fusion approach [2], which can give a globally optimal state estimate by directly combing the local measurement equations to obtain an augmented measurement equation, and its disadvantage is to require a large computation and communication burden. The other is the distributed fusion approach [3–6] which can combine or weight the local Kalman estimators to obtain a global optimal or suboptimal state estimator. Its advantages are that it can reduce the computation and communication burden and more robust and reliable, also has stronger fault-tolerance. The decentralized Kalman filter was presented in [3,4,56]. The federated Kalman filter was presented in [5]. The consensus Kalman filter was presented in [6] with the micro-Kalman filter. Based on the weighted least squares (WLS) method, two weighted measurement fusion algorithms are presented [7–11], which have the global optimality, and only require less computation burden. Its principle is as follows: applying the WLS method, the local measurement equations are weighted to obtain a fused measurement equation accompanied with the state equation, and then applying a single standard Kalman filter gives the weighted measurement fuser.Based on the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) weighting fusion rule, there are three optimal weighted state fusion algorithms weighted by matrices, diagonal matrices, scalars [12–16] and the covariance intersection (CI) fusion algorithm [15], where the fuser with optimal weighted matrices [12] includes the optimal track-to-track fuser with the two-sensor as a special case [16]. The weighted state fuser is obtained by weighting the local state estimators, which is a linear combination of the local state estimators. In order to compute the optimal weights, the cross-covariances among the local filtering errors are required [12–14]. However, in many theoretical and practical applications, the computation of the cross-covariances is very difficult and complicated [17–19], or the cross-covariances are unknown [15,20–23].In order to solve the above limitation, by the convex combination of the local conservative variances, the covariance intersection (CI) fusion Kalman filter was presented [15,20–23]. Compared with the above three weighted state fusion algorithms, it has advantages that the computation of cross-covariances is avoided, and it can handle the information fused estimation problems for systems with unknown cross-covariances. For the uncertain multisensor systems with unknown local variances and unknown cross-covariances, one of its disadvantages is to require known conservative upper bounds of unknown local estimation error variances. Therefore, in order to use CI fusion method, the design of the local robust Kalman filters with a minimal upper bound of actual filtering error variances is required. The other is that the CI fused estimate has certain conservativeness, because the cross-covariances information is ignored. Recently, an ellipsoidal intersection (EI) fuser with the cross-covariances information was presented in [22], which improved the accuracy of the CI fuser.The above four optimal weighted filtering approaches require to know the model parameters and noise variances accurately, but in many applications, this condition cannot always hold, the standard Kalman filtering may not be robust against the uncertainties of model parameters and noise variances, and may lead to the filter divergence. This has motivated many studies on robust Kalman filter design. For the systems with uncertain model parameters and/or noise variances, the so-called robust Kalman filter is concerned with the design of a fixed filter such that the actual filtering error variances have a minimal upper bound for all admissible uncertainties of the model parameters and/or noise variances [39]. Such property is called the robustness of the filter. In general, there are two approaches to design the robust Kalman filtering for systems with uncertain model parameters, the Riccati equation approach [24–33,36–41] and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach [24–46]. The finite and infinite horizon (time-varying and steady-state) robust Kalman filtering for time-varying or time-invariant discrete-time systems with model parameters uncertainties has been discussed in [45]. In [46] a robust finite-horizon Kalman filter is designed for discrete time-varying uncertain systems with uncertain model parameters based on two discrete Riccati difference equations. These robust Kalman filters mainly consider the situation with the parameters uncertainties, while the robust Kalman filtering problem with uncertain noise variances was considered in several references [47–49], and these existing results mainly focus on the design of the robust Kalman filters, while the robust Kalman predictors for time-varying systems with noise variances uncertainties were seldom reported in references. However, the multi-step Kalman prediction problems widely occur in many application problems, for example, target tracking, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), recover a man-made earth satellite, and impact point prediction of rocket [50]. In addition, although several robust information fusion Kalman filters were reported [27,28,32,36,44], but the robustness of the fused Kalman filters was not proved. Recently, the robust weighted fusion Kalman filters have been presented by our team [51], but the robust weighted fusion Kalman prediction problems are not solved. This yields the studies in this paper. This paper is based on the Lyapunov equation different to that in [51] to solve the robust fusion Kalman prediction problem.In this paper, by the minimax robust estimation principle [52], based on the worst-case conservative system with conservative upper bounds of noise variances, under the ULMV estimation rule, the conservative optimal local and fused time-varying Kalman predictors are presented, which yield the corresponding robust Kalman predictors. The proposed five robust weighted fusion Kalman predictors include the four weighted state fuser and a weighted measurement fuser, where a modified CI fuser with the conservative cross-covariances is a special fuser weighted by matrices.Furthermore, using the Lyapunov equation method [51], the robustness of the proposed robust Kalman predictors will be proved, which is completely different from the Riccati equation method and the LMI method. The robust accuracy relations of the local and weighted fusion robust Kalman predictors are proved. Specially, the corresponding robust local and fused steady-state Kalman predictors are also presented for multisensor time-invariant systems with uncertain noise variances, and the convergence in a realization between the time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman predictors is rigorously proved by the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method and the dynamic variance error system analysis (DVESA) method [53,54]. The principle of the DESA method is that the convergence in a realization is converted into a stability problem of a dynamic error system described by a difference equation, and the decision criterion of the stability was presented in [53]. The principle of the DVESA method is that the convergence of variances is converted into a stability problem of a dynamic variance error system described by a Lyapunov equation, and the decision criterion was presented in [54].The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem formulation. The local robust time-varying Kalman predictors and the robustness are presented in Section 3. The five weighted fusion robust time-varying Kalman predictors and their robustness are given in Section 4. The robust accuracy analysis of the local and fused Kalman predictors is presented in Section 5. The robust local and fused steady-state Kalman predictors and their convergence are presented in Section 6. Section 7 gives a simulation example. The conclusions are presented in Section 8.Consider the following multisensor uncertain time-varying system(1)x(t+1)=Φ(t)x(t)+Γ(t)w(t)(2)yi(t)=Hi(t)x(t)+vi(t),i=1,…,Lwhere t is the discrete time,x(t)∈Rnis the system state,yi(t)∈Rmiandvi(t)∈Rmiare the measurement and the measurement noise of theithsubsystem,w(t)∈Rris the input noise,Φ(t),Γ(t)andHi(t)are known time-varying matrices of appropriate dimensions.Assumption 1w(t)andvi(t)are uncorrelated white noises with zero means and unknown actual variancesQ¯(t)andR¯i(t), respectively, satisfying the relation that for all the time t,(3)Q¯(t)⩽Q(t),R¯i(t)⩽Ri(t),i=1,…,LwhereQ(t)andRi(t)are conservative upper bounds ofQ¯(t)andR¯i(t), respectively. The matrix inequalityA⩽Bmeans thatB−A⩾0is a positive semi-definite matrix.Assumption 2The conservative system with the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t)is uniformly completely controllable and uniformly completely observable.Assumption 3The initial statex(0)is independent of the noisesw(t)andvi(t), and with mean value μ and unknown uncertain actual covariance matrixP¯(0|−1)satisfying the following inequality(4)P¯(0|−1)⩽P(0|−1)whereP(0|−1)is a known conservative upper bound ofP¯(0|−1).Consider the worst-case conservative system (1) and (2) with the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t)of noise variances, under the ULMV rule, the conservative local optimal time-varying Kalman one-step predictors are given by [55](5)xˆi(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)xˆi(t|t−1)+Ki(t)yi(t),i=1,…,L(6)Ψi(t)=Φ(t)−Ki(t)Hi(t)(7)Ki(t)=Φ(t)Pi(t|t−1)HiT(t)Qεi−1(t)(8)Qεi(t)=Hi(t)Pi(t|t−1)HiT(t)+Ri(t)with the initial value(9)xˆi(0|−1)=μ,Pi(0|−1)=P(0|−1)The conservative one-step prediction error variancePi(t+1|t)satisfies the Lyapunov equations(10)Pi(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)Pi(t|t−1)ΨiT(t)+Γ(t)Q(t)ΓT(t)+Ki(t)Ri(t)KiT(t)and the prediction error cross-covariance has the following recursive formula(11)Pij(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)Pij(t|t−1)ΨiT(t)+Γ(t)Q(t)ΓT(t),(i≠j)Remark 1The conservative measurementsyi(t)are the measurements for the conservative system (1) and (2) with the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t), while the actual measurementsyi(t)are the measurements for the true system (1) and (2) with the true noise variancesQ¯(t)andR¯i(t). In the conservative local time-varying Kalman one-step predictors (5), the conservative measurementsyi(t)are unavailable, which are generated from the worst-case conservative system (1) and (2) with the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t)of noise variances. Only the actual measurementsyi(t)are available (known), which are generated from the true system (1) and (2) with the true noise variancesQ¯(t)andR¯i(t). Replacing the conservative measurementsyi(t)by the actual measurementsyi(t), we obtain the actual local one-step Kalman predictors (5).Here the minimax robust estimation principle is used in the sense that the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) estimator is obtained for the worst-case conservative system with the maximum noise variances (upper bounds of noise variances).Substituting (2) and (6) into (5) yields(12)xˆi(t+1|t)=Φ(t)xˆi(t|t−1)−Ki(t)Hi(t)xˆi(t|t−1)+Ki(t)Hi(t)x(t)+Ki(t)vi(t)Subtracting (12) from (1) yields(13)x˜i(t+1|t)=Φ(t)x˜i(t|t−1)+Γ(t)w(t)−Ki(t)Hi(t)x˜i(t|t−1)−Ki(t)vi(t)Applying (6), from (13) we have(14)x˜i(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)x˜i(t|t−1)+Γ(t)w(t)−Ki(t)vi(t)Applying (14), the actual one-step prediction error variances and cross-covariances satisfy the Lyapunov equations(15)P¯i(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)P¯i(t|t−1)ΨiT(t)+Γ(t)Q¯(t)ΓT(t)+Ki(t)R¯i(t)KiT(t)(16)P¯ij(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)P¯ij(t|t−1)ΨiT(t)+Γ(t)Q¯(t)ΓT(t),i≠j,i,j=1,…,Lwith the initial valuesP¯i(0|−1)=P¯(0|−1),P¯ij(0|−1)=P¯(0|−1).Using the projection theory [2], the conservative local optimal time-varying Kalman multi-step predictors are given by(17)xˆi(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)xˆi(t+1|t),i=1,…,L,N>1wherexˆi(t+1|t)is the conservative one-step predictor computed by (5).(18)Φ(t,i)=Φ(t−1)Φ(t−2)⋯Φ(i),Φ(t,t)=InThe conservative optimal ahead N step prediction error variance and cross-covariancesPij(t+N|t)are given by(19)Pij(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)Pij(t+1|t)ΦT(t+N,t+1)+∑s=2NΦ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)Q(t+s−1)ΓT(t+s−1)ΦT(t+N,t+s)Especially, wheni=j, we definePii(t+1|t)=Pi(t+1|t)andPii(t+N|t)=Pi(t+N|t)are the conservative one-step and multi-step prediction error variances, respectively.As shown in Remark 1, we define the conservative local multi-step Kalman predictorsxˆi(t+N|t)(17) with the actual local one-step Kalman predictorsxˆi(t+1|t)as the actual local multi-step Kalman predictors.Iterating (1), we have the non-recursive formula(20)x(t+N)=Φ(t+N,t+1)x(t+1)+∑i=t+2t+NΦ(t+N,i)Γ(i−1)w(i−1),N>1From (17), we have the actual multi-step prediction error(21)x˜(t+N|t)=x(t+N)−xˆ(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)x˜(t+1|t)+∑i=t+2t+NΦ(t+N,i)Γ(i−1)w(i−1),N>1So we have the actual ahead N step prediction error variance and cross-covariance(22)P¯ij(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)P¯ij(t+1|t)ΦT(t+N,t+1)+∑s=2NΦ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)Q¯(t+s−1)ΓT(t+s−1)ΦT(t+N,t+s)Especially, wheni=j, we defineP¯ii(t+1|t)=P¯i(t+1|t)andP¯ii(t+N|t)=P¯i(t+N|t)are the one-step and multi-step actual prediction error variances, respectively.Theorem 1For multisensor uncertain system(1)and(2)withAssumptions 1–3, the actual time-varying local Kalman one-step predictor(5)–(16)and multi-step predictor(17)–(22)are robust in the sense that for all admissible noise variances uncertaintiesQ¯(t)andR¯i(t)satisfying(3)and the uncertain initial actual variance satisfying(4), it follows that(23)P¯i(t+1|t)⩽Pi(t+1|t)(24)P¯i(t+N|t)⩽Pi(t+N|t)andPi(t+1|t)andPi(t+N|t)are the minimal upper bounds ofP¯i(t+1|t)andP¯i(t+N|t), respectively. Hence they are called the robust local one-step and multi-step Kalman predictors.ProofDefiningΔi(t+1|t)=Pi(t+1|t)−P¯i(t+1|t), subtracting (15) from (10) yields the Lyapunov equation(25)Δi(t+1|t)=Ψi(t)Δi(t|t−1)ΨiT(t)+Ui(t)(26)Ui(t)=Γ(t)(Q(t)−Q¯(t))ΓT(t)+Ki(t)(Ri(t)−R¯i(t))KiT(t)Applying Eqs. (3) and (26) yields thatUi(t)⩾0, from (4) and (9), we haveΔi(0|−1)=P(0|−1)−P¯(0|−1)⩾0. Hence from (25), we haveΔi(1|0)⩾0. Applying the mathematical induction method yieldsΔi(t+1|t)⩾0, i.e.P¯i(t+1|t)⩽Pi(t+1|t)holds.DefiningΔi(t+N|t)=Pi(t+N|t)−P¯i(t+N|t), subtracting (22) from (19) yields(27)Δi(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)(Pi(t+1|t)−P¯i(t+1|t))ΦT(t+N,t+1)+∑s=2NΦ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)(Q(t+s−1)−Q¯(t+s−1))ΓT(t+s−1)ΦT(t+N,t+s)Applying the robustness of the one-step predictor (23) and Assumption 3, we getΔi(t+N|t)⩾0, therefore (24) holds. TakingQ¯(t)=Q(t),R¯i(t)=Ri(t)andP¯(0|−1)=P(0|−1), then the constraints (3) and (4) are satisfied, and subtracting (15) from (10) recursively, we haveP¯i(t+1|t)=Pi(t+1|t). IfPi⁎(t+1|t)is an arbitrary other upper bound, then we havePi(t+1|t)=P¯i(t+1|t)⩽Pi⁎(t+1|t), so thatPi(t+1|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯i(t+1|t)satisfying the uncertainties (3) and (4). Similarly,Pi(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯i(t+N|t). The proof is completed. □Introduce the centralized fusion measurement equation(28)yc(t)=Hc(t)x(t)+vc(t)with the definitions(29)yc(t)=[y1T(t),…,yLT(t)]T,Hc(t)=[H1T(t),…,HLT(t)]T,vc(t)=[v1T(t),…,vLT(t)]TFor the worst-case conservative centralized fusion uncertain system (1) and (28) with the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t), applying the standard Kalman one-step and multi-step predictors, the conservative and actual centralized fusion time-varying Kalman predictorsxˆc(t+N|t)with the conservative and actual prediction error variancesPc(t+N|t)andP¯c(t+N|t)can be obtained respectively. Similar to Theorem 1, we can prove that the actual Kalman predictorxˆc(t+N|t)is robust in the sense thatP¯c(t+N|t)⩽Pc(t+N|t). Applying the weighted least square method, from (28), we have the conservative weighted fusion measurement equation [7–11](30)yM(t)=x(t)+vM(t)whereyM(t)is the conservative weighted fusion measurement andvM(t)is the conservative fused measurement white noise with conservative varianceRM(t), such that(31)yM(t)=[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)yi(t)(32)vM(t)=[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)vi(t)(33)RM(t)=[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1where we assume that the inverse matrix in (31)–(33) exists.For the conservative weighted measurement fusion system (1) and (30) with Assumptions 1–3 and the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t), applying the standard Kalman one-step and multi-step predictors, we can obtain the conservative weighted measurement fusion Kalman predictorxˆM(t+N|t)with the conservative and actual variancesPM(t+N|t)andP¯M(t+N|t)as(34)xˆM(t+1|t)=ΨM(t)xˆM(t|t−1)+KM(t)yM(t)ΨM(t)=Φ(t)−KM(t),(35)KM(t)=Φ(t)PM(t|t−1)[PM(t|t−1)+RM(t)]−1(36)PM(t+1|t)=ΨM(t)PM(t|t−1)ΨMT(t)+Γ(t)Q(t)ΓT(t)+KM(t)RM(t)KMT(t)(37)xˆM(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)xˆM(t+1|t),N>1(38)Φ(t,i)=Φ(t−1)Φ(t−2)⋯Φ(i),Φ(t,t)=InIn (34)–(36), the measurement matrix does not occur, because from (30) we have the measurement matrix is the identity matrix. The conservative N-step prediction error variancePM(t+N|t)is given by(39)PM(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)PM(t+1|t)ΦT(t+N,t+1)+∑s=2NΦ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)Q(t+s−1)ΓT(t+s−1)ΦT(t+N,t+s)wherePM(t+1|t)is the conservative one-step prediction error variance.As shown in Remark 1, we call the conservative centralized Kalman predictors and the conservative weighted measurement fusion Kalman predictors with the actual measurementsyi(t)as the actual centralized and weighted measurement fused Kalman predictors, respectively.We easily obtain the actual one-step and N-step prediction error variances respectively as(40)P¯M(t+1|t)=ΨM(t)P¯M(t|t−1)ΨMT(t)+Γ(t)Q¯(t)ΓT(t)+KM(t)R¯M(t)KMT(t)with the initial value(41)P¯M(0|−1)=P¯(0|−1)⩽PM(0|−1)=P(0|−1)whereR¯M(t)is the actual variance ofvM(t), and from (32) it follows that(42)R¯M(t)=[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)R¯i(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1Similar to (39), we have actual N-step prediction error variances as(43)P¯M(t+N|t)=Φ(t+N,t+1)P¯M(t+1|t)ΦT(t+N,t+1)+∑s=2NΦ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)Q¯(t+s−1)ΓT(t+s−1)ΦT(t+N,t+s)Corollary 1For multisensor uncertain system(1)and(2)withAssumptions 1–3and the conservative upper boundsQ(t)andRi(t), the actual weighted measurement fusion Kalman predictors(34)–(43)are robust in the sense that for all admissible variancesQ¯(t),R¯i(t)andP¯M(0|−1)satisfying(3)and(41), it follows that(44)P¯M(t+1|t)⩽PM(t+1|t),P¯M(t+N|t)⩽PM(t+N|t)andPM(t+1|t),PM(t+N|t)are the minimal upper bounds ofP¯M(t+1|t)andP¯M(t+N|t), respectively. Hence they are called the robust weighted measurement fusion Kalman predictors.ProofFor the equivalent system (1) and (30), from (3), (33) and (42), we have(45)RM(t)−R¯M(t)=[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)(Ri(t)−R¯i(t))Ri−1(t)Hi(t)[∑i=1LHiT(t)Ri−1(t)Hi(t)]−1⩾0which yieldsR¯M(t)⩽RM(t). Applying the derivation completely similar to Theorem 1 yields (44).

They are called the robust weighted fusion Kalman predictors.ProofDefiningΔPθ(t+N|t)=Pθ(t+N|t)−P¯θ(t+N|t), subtracting (69) from (68) yields(74)ΔPθ(t+N|t)=Ωθ(t+N|t)(P(t+N|t)−P¯(t+N|t))ΩθT(t+N|t)In order to prove the robustnessΔPθ(t+N|t)⩾0, we only need to prove the inequalityP(t+N|t)−P¯(t+N|t)⩾0holds.Applying (19) and (49) yields the augmented conservative prediction error variance matrix(75)P(t+N|t)=Φa(t+N|t+1)P(t+1|t)ΦaT(t+N|t+1)+∑s=2NΔ(t+N,t+s)Qa(t+s−1)ΔT(t+N,t+s)where we define(76)Φa(t+N|t+1)=[Φ(t+N,t+1)0⋱0Φ(t+N,t+1)],P(t+1|t)=[P1(t+1|t)⋯P1L(t+1|t)⋮⋱⋮PL1(t+1|t)⋯PL(t+1|t)],Δ(t+N,t+s)=[Φ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)0⋱0Φ(t+N,t+s)Γ(t+s−1)],Qa(t+s−1)=[Q(t+s−1)⋯Q(t+s−1)⋮⋱⋮Q(t+s−1)⋯Q(t+s−1)]Similarly, the augmented actual prediction error variance matrixP¯(t+N|t)can be expressed as(77)P¯(t+N|t)=Φa(t+N|t+1)P¯(t+1|t)ΦaT(t+N|t+1)+∑s=2NΔ(t+N,t+s)Q¯a(t+s−1)ΔT(t+N,t+s),P¯(t+1|t)=[P¯1(t+1|t)⋯P¯1L(t+1|t)⋮⋱⋮P¯L1(t+1|t)⋯P¯L(t+1|t)],Q¯a(t+s−1)=[Q¯(t+s−1)⋯Q¯(t+s−1)⋮⋱⋮Q¯(t+s−1)⋯Q¯(t+s−1)]Subtracting (77) from (75) yields(78)P(t+N|t)−P¯(t+N|t)=Φa(t+N|t+1)(P(t+1|t)−P¯(t+1|t))ΦaT(t+N|t+1)+∑s=2NΔ(t+N,t+s)(Qa(t+s−1)−Q¯a(t+s−1))ΔT(t+N,t+s)Applying (10) and (11), we obtain the augmented Lyapunov equation of the one-step prediction error variance matrixP(t+1|t)(79)P(t+1|t)=Ψa(t)P(t|t−1)ΨaT(t)+Γa(t)Qa(t)ΓaT(t)+K(t)R(t)KT(t),Ψa(t)=[Ψ1(t)0⋱0ΨL(t)],Γa(t)=[Γ(t)0⋱0Γ(t)],K(t)=[K1(t)0⋱0KL(t)],Qa(t)=[Q(t)⋯Q(t)⋮⋱⋮Q(t)⋯Q(t)],R(t)=[R1(t)0⋱0RL(t)]Similarly,P¯(t+1|t)can be expressed as(80)P¯(t+1|t)=Ψa(t)P¯(t|t−1)ΨaT(t)+Γa(t)Q¯a(t)ΓaT(t)+K(t)R¯(t)KT(t),Q¯a(t)=[Q¯(t)⋯Q¯(t)⋮⋱⋮Q¯(t)⋯Q¯(t)],R¯(t)=[R¯1(t)0⋱0R¯L(t)]Subtracting (79) from (80) yields the Lyapunov equation(81)P(t+1|t)−P¯(t+1|t)=Ψa(t)(P(t|t−1)−P¯(t|t−1))ΨaT(t)+Δ(t),Δ(t)=Γa(t)(Qa(t)−Q¯a(t))ΓaT(t)+K(t)(R(t)−R¯(t))KT(t)Applying (3), Lemmas 1 and 2 yieldsQ¯a(t)⩽Qa(t),R¯(t)⩽R(t), so we haveΔ(t)⩾0. Similar to the proof of Theorem 1, we haveP(t+1|t)−P¯(t+1|t)⩾0. From (78), applyingQ¯a(t)⩽Qa(t), we haveP(t+N|t)−P¯(t+N|t)⩾0, from (74), we obtainΔPθ(t+N|t)⩾0, so the robustness (73) holds. TakingQ¯(t)=Q(t),R¯i(t)=Ri(t)andP¯(0|−1)=P(0|−1), then the constraints (3) and (4) are satisfied, and subtracting (15) from (10), and fromP(0|−1)−P¯(0|−1)=0, recursively, we haveP¯i(t+1|t)=Pi(t+1|t). Similarly from (11) and (16) we haveP¯ij(t+1|t)=Pij(t+1|t). From (49) and (70), we haveP¯(t+1|t)=P(t+1|t), and from (79) and (80), we haveQ¯a(t)=Qa(t). Hence, applying (78), we haveP¯(t+N|t)=P(t+N|t), and from (74) yieldsP¯θ(t+N|t)=Pθ(t+N|t). IfPθ⁎(t+N|t)is an arbitrary other upper bound, then we havePθ(t+N|t)=P¯θ(t+N|t)⩽Pθ⁎(t+N|t), so thatPθ(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯θ(t+N|t)for all admissible uncertainties satisfying the uncertainties (3) and (4). The proof is completed. □Remark 2The trace of an error variance matrix is equivalent to the sum of error variances for the state components, which can represent the estimation accuracy. However, the determinant of an error variance matrix does not directly represent the estimation accuracy in the error variance sense, which is only geometrically related to the volume of the ellipsoid defined form this variance matrix [59], and the computation of the determinate is complicated than that of trace. Therefore we do not employ the determinant of the variance matrix to represent the accuracy.Remark 3From (73), takingθ=CIyieldsP¯CI(t+N|t)⩽PCI(t+N|t), and from Theorem 2,PCI(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯CI(t+N|t)for all admissible uncertainties of noise variances. From (65) we see thatPCI(t+N|t)is determined based on the conservative cross-covariances. In the other hand, it was proved [57,58,60] thatPCI⁎(t+N|t)defined by (62) is also an upper bound ofP¯CI(t+N|t), i.e.,(82)P¯CI(t+N|t)⩽PCI⁎(t+N|t)From (62) we see thatPCI⁎(t+N|t)is determined without the conservative cross-covariances, so thatPCI⁎(t+N|t)has certain conservativeness. SincePCI(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯CI(t+N|t), then(83)P¯CI(t+N|t)⩽PCI(t+N|t)⩽PCI⁎(t+N|t),trPCI(t+N|t)⩽trPCI⁎(t+N|t)This means that the actual estimation error variancesP¯CI(t+N|t)have the two upper bounds such that the conservative upper boundPCI⁎(t+N|t)and minimal upper boundPCI(t+N|t). To the best of our knowledge, the minimal upper boundPCI(t+N|t)of the CI fuser given in (65) is presented for the first time.Remark 4The weighted measurement fusion formulae (31)–(33) related to the information filter [4]. The optimality has the relativity. The optimality is related to some optimal fusion rules or performance indexes over the different linear spaces with different constraints (matrix, diagonal matrix, or scalar), the corresponding ULMV optimal estimators are also different, because they are found in different constrained linear spaces, although they are all called “optimal” in the ULMV sense, but their accuracies are different [13,58]. For example, for multisensor system, the centralized fusion Kalman filter is globally optimal, its accuracy is higher than that of the fuser with matrix weights (the proof is given in [58]). Compared with the fuser with matrix weights, the fuser with scalar weights or diagonal weights can reduce the computational burden [13,58], and its accuracy is higher than that of each local estimator. From (48), (52), (53), (57) and (58), we see that the complexity of computing the matrix weights isO((nL)3), and the complexity of computing scalar or diagonal weights isO(L3).The symbolsP¯θ(t+N|t)andPθ(t+N|t)denote the actual and conservative prediction error variance matrix respectively, where the subscript denotes a class of robust predictors, such thatθ=idenotes theithlocal filter,θ=m,s,ddenote the fuser with matrix weights, scalar weights, and diagonal weights respectively, andθ=CI,M,cdenote the CI fuser, weighted measurement fuser, and centralized fuser, respectively.From (23), (24), (73) and (44), we obtain the robustness of the local and fused robust Kalman predictors as(84)P¯θ(t+N|t)⩽Pθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,m,s,d,CI,M,cfor all admissible uncertainties ofQ¯(t),R¯i(t)andP¯(0|−1)satisfying (3) and (4). The inequalities (84) denote the accuracy relations with the matrix inequalities, which give the upper bounds of the actual variances, respectively. Taking the trace operations for (84) yields the accuracy relations with the trace inequalities(85)trP¯θ(t+N|t)⩽trPθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,m,s,d,CI,M,cDefinition 1SincePθ(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯θ(t+N|t), then we definetrPθ(t+N|t)as the robust accuracy of the robust Kalman predictorxˆθ(t+N|t), and definetrP¯θ(t+N|t)as its actual accuracy.Remark 5Definition 1 gives a quantitative index for the accuracy comparison. The actual accuracytrP¯θ(t+N|t)is related to the uncertainties ofQ¯(t),R¯i(t)andP¯(0|−1)satisfying (3) and (4), while the robust accuracytrPθ(t+N|t)is independent ofQ¯(t),R¯i(t)andP¯(0|−1), which only related to the conservative upper boundsQ(t),Ri(t)andP(0|−1).trPθ(t+N|t)is a minimal upper bound of all admissible tracestrP¯θ(t+N|t)yielded by the uncertainties ofQ¯(t),R¯i(t)andP¯(0|−1)satisfying (3) and (4), i.e., all admissible tracestrP¯θ(t+N|t)are globally controlled bytrPθ(t+N|t). Therefore, the robust accuracy is also called the global accuracy of a robust Kalman predictor. This definition shows that the smallertrPθ(t+N|t)means the higher robust accuracy, and the smallertrP¯θ(t+N|t)means the higher actual accuracy. The robust accuracy is admissible worst actual accuracy, and is also lowest bound of actual accuracies.Corollary 2For multisensor uncertain system(1)and(2)withAssumptions 1–3, the robust and actual accuracy relations with the matrix or trace inequalities are given as(86)P¯θ(t+N|t)⩽Pθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,m,s,d,CI,M,c,N⩾1PM(t+N|t)=Pc(t+N|t),(87)P¯M(t+N|t)=P¯c(t+N|t)(88)Pc(t+N|t)⩽Pm(t+N|t)(89)Pm(t+N|t)⩽Pθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,d,s,CI(90)PM(t+N|t)⩽Pθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,m,d,s,CI(91)trP¯θ(t+N|t)⩽trPθ(t+N|t),θ=1,…,L,m,s,d,CI,M,c(92)trPM(t+N|t)=trPc(t+N|t),trP¯M(t+N|t)=trP¯c(t+N|t)(93)trPM(t+N|t)⩽trPm(t+N|t)⩽trPd(t+N|t)⩽trPs(t+N|t)⩽trPi(t+N|t),i=1,…,LP¯CI(t+N|t)⩽PCI(t+N|t),PCI(t+N|t)⩽PCI⁎(t+N|t),(94)trP¯CI(t+N|t)⩽trPCI(t+N|t)⩽trPCI⁎(t+N|t)⩽trPi(t+N|t),i=1,…,LProofFrom (84) and (85), we have (86) and (91). Based on the information filter, it was proved [11] thatPM(t+N|t)=Pc(t+N|t). Similarly, we easily proveP¯M(t+N|t)=P¯c(t+N|t). Hence (87) holds. The inequalities (88) and (89) were proved in [58,60]. From (87)–(89), we obtain (90). Taking the trace operations for (86) and (87) yields (91) and (92). Applying (90) yields the first inequality in (93), and the remained inequalities in (93) were proved in [58,60]. In (64), takingωi(t)=1andωj(t)=0(j≠i) yieldstrPCI⁎(t+N|t)=trPi(t+N|t), hence minimizingtrPCI⁎(t+N|t)with constraint (63) yieldstrPCI⁎(t+N|t)⩽trPi(t+N|t), and then applying (82) and (83) yields (94). The proof is completed. □Remark 6Corollary 2 gives the two representations of the robust accuracy relations by using the matrix inequality and trace inequality, respectively. Compared with the accuracy relations with matrix inequalities, the accuracy relations with the trace inequalities are more general, simple, and useful, since the accuracy relation with matrix inequality between arbitrary two different variance matrices may not exist, but their accuracy relation with the trace inequality is always to exist.From (94),PCI(t+N|t)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯CI(t+N|t), whilePCI⁎(t+N|t)is a conservative upper bound ofP¯CI(t+N|t). Therefore according to Definition 1, the robust accuracy of the CI fuser istrPCI(t+N|t), rather thantrPCI⁎(t+N|t). This means the modified CI fuser with robust accuracytrPCI(t+N|t)improves and increases the robust accuracy of the original CI fuser with robust accuracytrPCI⁎(t+N|t). Geometrically, the covariance ellipse ofPCI(t+N|t)is enclosed in the covariance ellipse ofPCI⁎(t+N|t). (See Fig. 7.)Remark 7An estimate of the unknown variance matrix is called to be conservative, if it is an upper bound of the true variance matrix, i.e., the true variance matrix is over estimated. A less upper bound means that this estimate has less-conservativeness. The conservative fused estimate or fusion rule is defined as follows [22]: “The fused estimate should be conservative in the sense that it never underestimates the true uncertainty associated with the estimate.” This means that it over estimates the true uncertainty, i.e., it gives an upper bound of the true fused error variance. For example, from the robustness (86), each weighted fusion estimate or fusion rule is conservative, and has least-conservativeness, because it gives a minimal upper bound.Now we investigate the asymptotic properties of the local and fused robust time-varying Kalman predictors, we shall present the corresponding steady-state robust Kalman predictors. We shall also rigorously prove the convergence in a realization between the robust time-varying and steady-state Kalman predictors, by the DESA method and DVESA method [53,54].Lemma 3(See[55].) Consider the following Lyapunov equation with F being a symmetric matrix(95)P=ΨPΨT+Fwhere P, Ψ and F are then×nmatrices, Ψ is a stable matrix (i.e., all its eigenvalues are inside the unit circle).

IfU(t)is bounded, thenP(t)is bounded. IfU(t)→0, thenP(t)→0, ast→∞.Notice thatU(t)is called to be bounded, if‖U(t)‖⩽c(constant), for arbitraryt⩾0.Lemma 5DESA method(See[53].)

Hence they are called the robust steady-state Kalman predictors.ProofAccording to the complete observability and complete controllability of each subsystem, we have [2](115)Pi(t+1|t)→Σi,ast→∞,i=1,…,Lthen from (6) and (7), we have(116)Ψi(t)→Ψi,Ki(t)→Ki,ast→∞,i=1,…,LwhereΨiare stable matrices [2], andΨi(t)are uniformly asymptotically stable [61]. Whent→∞, taking the limit operations for (5)–(16), we obtain (99)–(105). FromKi(t)→Ki, we haveKi(t)are bounded, which yields the boundedness of the input of the Lyapunov equation (10). Hence applying Lemma 4 to (10) yields thatPi(t+1|t)is bounded. Similarly,Pij(t+1|t)are bounded. SettingΨi(t)=Ψi+ΔΨi(t)withΔΨi(t)→0, and subtracting (104) from (10) and (11) withHi(t)=Hi,Γ(t)=Γ,Q(t)=QandRi(t)=Ri, and definingΔij(t)=Pij(t+1|t)−Σij, yield the Lyapunov equations(117)Δij(t)=ΨiΔi(t−1)ΨjT+Uij(t)with(118)Uij(t)=Ki(t)RiKjT(t)δij−KiRiKjTδij+ΨiPij(t|t−1)ΔΨjT(t)+ΔΨi(t)Pij(t|t−1)Ψj+ΔΨi(t)ΔΨjT(t)whereδii=1,δij=0(i≠j). ApplyingKi(t)→Ki, the boundedness ofPij(t|t−1), andΔΨi(t)→0yield thatUij(t)→0. Applying Lemma 4 to (117) yieldsΔij(t)→0, ast→∞, i.e., (106) holds. Similarly, we can prove (107). Applying (106) and (107), taking the limit operations for (17)–(24) yields (108)–(114).Now we prove that the upper boundΣiis minimal.

TakingQ¯=QandR¯i=Ri, from (146) and (147), we haveR¯M=RM, so that from (143) and (144) yieldsΣ¯M=ΣM. Hence from (148) and (149), we haveP¯M(N)=PM(N). Further, applying the derivation similar to Corollary 3 yields thatΣMandPM(N)are minimal. The proof is completed. □Remark 8The measurements data ofyi(t)can be reviewed as a realization of stochastic processyi(t). Based on the measurements data ofyi(t), we can obtain a corresponding realization ofxˆi(t+N|t)orxˆis(t+N|t). The boundedness of measurement data ofyi(t)is in the sense that the norm ofyi(t)is uniformity bounded with respect to t.Theorem 4Under the conditions ofCorollary 3, if the measurements data ofyi(t)are bounded, then the robust local time-varying and steady-state one-step Kalman predictorsxˆi(t+1|t)andxˆis(t+1|t)have each other the convergence in a realization, such that(151)[xˆi(t+1|t)−xˆis(t+1|t)]→0,ast→∞,i.a.rwhere the notation “i.a.r” denotes the convergence in a realization[53], and we have the convergence in a realization between the robust time-varying and steady-state Kalman multi-step predictors(152)[xˆi(t+N|t)−xˆis(t+N|t)]→0,ast→∞,i.a.r,N⩾2(153)[xˆθ(t+N|t)−xˆθs(t+N|t)]→0,ast→∞,i.a.r,N⩾1,θ=m,d,s,CI,Mand we have the convergence of variances(154)Pi(t+1|t)→Σi,ast→∞,i=1,…,L(155)Pi(t+N|t)→Pi(N),ast→∞,i=1,…,L(156)Pθ(t+N|t)→Pθ(N),ast→∞,N⩾1,θ=m,d,s,CI,MProofSettingΨi(t)=Ψi+ΔΨi(t),Ki(t)=Ki+ΔKi(t)in (5), applying (116) yieldsΔΨi(t)→0,ΔKi(t)→0, ast→∞. Subtracting (99) from (5), and definingδi(t)=xˆi(t+N|t)−xˆis(t+N|t), we have the dynamic error system(157)δi(t)=Ψiδi(t−1)+ui(t)withui(t)=ΔΨi(t)xˆi(t|t−1)+ΔKi(t)yi(t). Noting thatΨi(t)is uniformly asymptotically stable [61], andΔKi(t)yi(t)is bounded, applying Lemma 5 to (5) yields the boundedness ofxˆi(t+1|t). Hence we haveui(t)→0. Applying Lemma 5 to (157), noting thatΨiis a stable matrix, so it is also uniformly asymptotically stable, henceδi(t)→0, i.e. the convergence (151) holds. Noting thatxˆi(t+N|t)−xˆis(t+N|t)=ΦN−1(xˆi(t+1|t)−xˆis(t+1|t)), applying (151) yields (152). Applying (106) easily yields (154)–(156).Forθ=m,d,s,CI, the four robust fusersxˆθ(t+N|t)andxˆθs(t+N|t)can be represented in a unified form, respectively(158)xˆθ(t+N|t)=∑i=1LΩiθ(t+N|t)xˆi(t+N|t),θ=m,d,s,CI(159)xˆθs(t+N|t)=∑i=1LΩiθ(N)xˆis(t+N|t),θ=m,d,s,CIApplying (106) yieldsΩiθ(t+N|t)→Ωiθ(N), ast→∞. SettingΩiθ(t+N|t)=Ωiθ(N)+ΔΩiθ(t+N|t), thenΔΩiθ(t+N|t)→0. Subtracting (159) from (158) yields(160)xˆθ(t+N|t)−xˆθs(t+N|t)=∑i=1LΩiθ(N)[xˆi(t+N|t)−xˆis(t+N|t)]+∑i=1LΔΩiθ(t+N|t)xˆi(t+N|t)Applying (151), the boundedness ofxˆi(t+N|t), andΔΩiθ(t+N|t)→0, yields that (153) holds forθ=m,d,s,CI. Forθ=M, applying the similar derivation yields (153).

The proof is completed. □Remark 9Corollary 5 shows that the robust accuracies of all the robust steady-state fused Kalman predictors are higher than that of each local robust Kalman predictor. The inequality (168) shows that the robust accuracy of the weighted measurement fuser is higher than that of the fuser with matrix weights, the robust accuracy of the fuser with matrix weights is higher than that of the robust predictor with scalar weights, while the robust accuracy of the fuser with diagonal matrix weights is in between both of them. The inequalities (162) and (167) show that the robust accuracy of the weighted measurement fuser is equivalent to that of the centralized fuser. The inequalities (169) show that the robust accuracy given bytrPCI(N)is higher than that given bytrPCI⁎(N), becausePCI(N)is the minimal upper bound ofP¯CI(N).Example 1Consider a three-sensor tracking system with uncertain noise variances(170)x(t+1)=Φx(t)+Γw(t)(171)yi(t)=Hix(t)+vi(t),i=1,2,3,L=3Φ=[1T001],Γ=[0.5T02T0],(172)H1=[10],H2=I2,H3=[10]whereT0=0.5is the sampled period,x(t)=[x1(t),x2(t)]Tis the state,x1(t)andx2(t)are the position and velocity of target.w(t)andvi(t)are independent Gaussian white noises with zero mean and unknown actual variancesQ¯andR¯irespectively, satisfyQ¯⩽QandR¯i⩽Ri. We takeN=2,Q=1,R1=1,R2=diag(8,0.36),R3=0.64,Q¯=0.8,R¯1=0.8,R¯2=diag(6,0.25),R¯3=0.54.The robust and actual accuracy comparisons of local and fused robust Kalman predictors are shown in Tables 1 and 2, which verify the accuracy relations (91)–(94) and (166)–(169).The comparisons of the trace of the prediction error variance matrices between the local and weighted fused time-varying robust Kalman predictors are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. From Figs. 1 and 2, we can see that the robustness (91) holds. We also see that the traces of the time-varying Kalman predictors quickly converge to these of the corresponding steady-state Kalman predictors, and their steady-state robust and actual accuracy relations (166)–(169) are also verified. From Fig. 2, we see that the robust weighted measurement fuser has the highest robust accuracy (i.e.trPM(t+2|t)is smallest), andtrPCI(t+2|t)⩽trPCI⁎(t+2|t).Example 2For the system (170)–(172) with uncertain time-varying noise variances, takingQ=1,Q¯=0.8+0.2sin(2πt/100),R1=1.5,R¯1=1.2+0.3sin(2πt/100),R2=diag(8,2),R¯2=diag[6+2sin(2πt/100),1.6+0.4sin(2πt/100)],R3=4,R¯3=3.5+0.5sin(2πt/100).The comparisons of the traces of the prediction error variances between the local and weighted fused Kalman predictors are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, which verify the robustness (91).In order to give a geometric interpretation of the matrix accuracy relations, the covariance ellipse is defined as the locus of points{x:xTP−1x=c}, where P is then×nvariance matrix,x∈Rnand c is a constant. Generally, we selectc=1without loss of generality. It has been proved in [23,60] thatP1⩽P2is equivalent to that the covariance ellipse ofP1is enclosed in that ofP2.From Figs. 5, 6 and 7, we see that the covariance ellipses of actual robust steady-state Kalman predictorsP¯i(i=1,2,3,m,s,d,CI,M) are all enclosed in these of their conservative upper boundsPiwhich verify the matrix accuracy relations (161)–(165) and (169). From Fig. 7, we see that the ellipse ofP¯CIis enclosed in that ofPCI, and the ellipse ofPCIis enclosed in that ofPCI⁎. Hence the first and second inequalities of (169) are verified.In order to verify the above theoretical accuracy relations, Fig. 8gives the mean square error (MSE) curves withρ=500Monte-Carlo simulation runs, the mean square error (MSE) value at time t of local and fused robust Kalman two-step predictors is defined as the trace of the sampled variance ofP¯θ(t+N|t), i.e.,(173)MSEi(N)(t)=1ρ∑j=1ρ(x(j)(t+N)−xˆi(j)(t+N|t))T(x(j)(t+N)−xˆi(j)(t+N|t)),i=1,…,L,m,s,d,M,CIwherex(j)(t+N)orxˆi(j)(t+N|t)denotes thejthrealization (sample) ofx(t+N)orxˆi(t+N|t).According to the consistency of the sampled variance, we have the convergence in probability such that for everyε>0(174)limρ→∞Pr(|MSEθ(N)(t)−trP¯θ(N)|<ε)=1,ρ→∞,t=1,…,tf,θ=1,2,3,m,s,d,CI,M,N=2wherePr(⋅)denotes the probability of the event.The MSE curves of the local and fused time-variant robust Kalman predictors are shown in Fig. 8, we see that when t is sufficiently large, we have the accuracy relations(175)MSEM(N)(t)⩽MSEm(N)(t)⩽MSEd(N)(t)⩽MSEs(N)(t)⩽MSEi(N)(t),i=1,2,3MSEθ(N)(t)⩽trP¯θ(N),θ=1,2,3,m,s,d,CI,M,(176)MSECI(N)(t)⩽MSEi(N)(t),i=1,2,3and the curves ofMSEθ(N)(t)are close to the straight lines corresponding totrP¯θ(N), which verify the accuracy relations (91)–(94) and the consistency (174).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper has addressed the robust weighted fusion Kalman prediction problem of multisensor time-varying systems with uncertain noise variances. The main contributions are as follows:1.A minimax robust filtering approach of designing the robust local and weighted fused Kalman predictors has been presented for multisensor system with uncertain noise variances. Based on the minimax robust estimation principle, for the worst-case conservative system with conservative upper bounds of noise variances, using the ULMV optimal estimation rule, the conservative local and fused Kalman predictors with the conservative measurements are presented, and then replacing the conservative measurements with the actual measurements, the robust local and fused Kalman predictors are obtained. Here the so-called minimax estimation approach means that for the worst-case conservative system with maximum noise variances (conservative upper bound), we find the minimum variance (optimal) state estimators, which yield the corresponding robust estimators.The five robust weighted fusion time-varying Kalman predictors have been presented, which contain a robust Kalman weighted measurement fuser, three robust Kalman state fusers weighted by matrices, diagonal matrices, scalars and a modified CI fuser. They overcome the limitation of robust Kalman filters for systems with uncertainties of the model parameters. The existing optimal weighted fusion Kalman estimators with exactly known model parameters and noise variances were extended to the robust weighted fusion Kalman predictors for multisensor systems with uncertain noise variances. The robust weighted fusion Kalman filters with uncertain noise variances [51] are extended to the Kalman predictors case.The existent CI fusion method [15,20–23] provided a conservative upper bound of actual fused error variances. It is computed via the convex combination of the local conservative estimation error variances, where the information of conservative cross-covariances was not used. Therefore a way of improving the robust accuracy of the CI fuser is to reduce the conservative upper bound by considering the conservative cross-covariances information. We presented a minimal upper bound with conservative cross-covariances, which is less than the conservative upper bound without conservative cross-covariances. This yields a modified robust CI fuser, whose robust accuracy is higher than that of the original CI fuser [15]. Notice that the proposed modified CI fuser with the conservative cross-covariances developed and extended the ellipsoidal intersection (EI) fuser with the cross-covariances [22].Using Lyapunov equation approach [51], the robustness of the local and fused Kalman predictors has been proved in a unified framework, that is different from the existing approaches – the Riccati equation approach and the LMI approach.The robust accuracy relations of the robust local and fused Kalman predictors were rigorously proved. It was proved that the robust accuracies of all fused Kalman predictors were higher than that of each local Kalman predictor, the robust accuracy of the fuser with matrix weights was higher than that of the fuser with scalar weights, and the robust accuracy of the fuser with diagonal matrix weights was in between both of them, and the robust accuracy of the weighted measurement fuser was equal to that of the centralized fuser, and was higher than that of the fuser with matrix weights.For the multisensor time-invariant systems with uncertain noise variances, the robust local and fused steady-state Kalman predictors have been presented, and the convergence in a realization between the time-varying and steady-state Kalman predictors was proved by the DESA method [53] and the DVESA method [54].The above results construct a weighted fusion robust Kalman prediction theory for the multisensor systems with uncertainties of noise variances. It includes that: (i) a new minimax estimation approach of designing the robust Kalman predictors, (ii) the local and five weighted fusion time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman predictors, (iii) a Lyapunov equation approach for robustness analysis, (iv) the concept of robust accuracy with respect to the uncertainties and robust accuracy analysis and comparison, (v) the convergence analysis between the time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman fusers.This paper is limited to design the robust local and fused Kalman predictors for the multisensor systems with uncertain noise variances, and the proposed theory can be applied to design the robust local and fused Kalman smoothers, but the derivations are based on the diffident Lyapunov equations. The design of the robust local and fused Kalman filters has been presented in [51]. The extension of the proposed results to the multisensor systems with both uncertain model parameters and noise variances is in the investigation.
