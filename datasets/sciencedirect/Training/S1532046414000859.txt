@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundThe ability to predict acuity (patients’ care needs), would provide a powerful tool for health care managers to allocate resources. Such estimations and predictions for the care process can be produced from the vast amounts of healthcare data using information technology and computational intelligence techniques. Tactical decision-making and resource allocation may also be supported with different mathematical optimization models.MethodsThis study was conducted with a data set comprising electronic nursing narratives and the associated Oulu Patient Classification (OPCq) acuity. A mathematical model for the automated assignment of patient acuity scores was utilized and evaluated with the pre-processed data from 23,528 electronic patient records. The methods to predict patient’s acuity were based on linguistic pre-processing, vector-space text modeling, and regularized least-squares regression.ResultsThe experimental results show that it is possible to obtain accurate predictions about patient acuity scores for the coming day based on the assigned scores and nursing notes from the previous day. Making same-day predictions leads to even better results, as access to the nursing notes for the same day boosts the predictive performance. Furthermore, textual nursing notes allow for more accurate predictions than previous acuity scores. The best results are achieved by combining both of these information sources. The developed model achieves a concordance index of 0.821 when predicting the patient acuity scores for the following day, given the scores and text recorded on the previous day.ConclusionsBy applying language technology to electronic patient documents it is possible to accurately predict the value of the acuity scores of the coming day based on the previous daýs assigned scores and nursing notes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One key question in a care process continuum is how to predict the next steps within it. Crucially, being able to predict the care needs of patients would help to reduce the rising costs of healthcare. The ability to predict acuity (patients’ care needs), would provide a powerful tool for health-care managers to allocate resources [1,2].Tactical decision-making and resource planning in hospitals includes short- and medium-range plans, schedules and budgets. Tactical decision-making also includes monitoring the performance of organizational subunits, including departments, divisions, process teams, project teams and other workgroups [3,4]. Tactical resource planning in hospitals focuses on elective patient admission planning and the intermediate-term allocation of resource capacities [5,6]. The main objectives of this planning are equitable access for patients, meeting production targets and/or serving the strategically agreed number of patients, and efficiently using resources [7]. For example, in a perioperative unit this might include the decisions to hire more staff to extend hours, expand the operating room capacity, purchase equipment, increase block time for a surgical group or to build a free-standing facility [8]. The objectives of capacity allocation are to balance surgical and postsurgical resources [9–11] to maximize the contribution margin per hour of surgical time [12].
