@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Cell counting is one of the basic needs of most biological experiments. Numerous methods and systems have been studied to improve the reliability of counting. However, at present, manual cell counting performed with a hemocytometer still represents the gold standard, despite several problems limiting reproducibility and repeatability of the counts and, at the end, jeopardizing their reliability in general. We present our own approach based on image processing techniques to improve counting reliability. It works in two stages: first building a high-resolution image of the hemocytometer's grid, then counting the live and dead cells by tagging the image with flags of different colours. In particular, we introduce GridMos (http://sourceforge.net/p/gridmos), a fully-automated mosaicing method to obtain a mosaic representing the whole hemocytometer's grid. In addition to offering more significant statistics, the mosaic “freezes” the culture status, thus permitting analysis by more than one operator. Finally, the mosaic achieved can thus be tagged by using an image editor, thus markedly improving counting reliability. The experiments performed confirm the improvements brought about by the proposed counting approach in terms of both reproducibility and repeatability, also suggesting the use of a mosaic of an entire hemocytometer's grid, then labelled trough an image editor, as the best likely candidate for the new gold standard method in cell counting.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the invention of the hemocytometer (attributed to Louis-Charles Malassez, 1842–1909), cell counting has become a common procedure performed routinely in thousands of laboratories all over the world. Furthermore, at the beginning of the 20th century, with the introduction of the cell staining in standard analyses, e.g. Trypan Blue to assess cell viability [1], live and dead cell counting became one of the most common biological procedures [2]. Nowadays, obtaining accurate counts of cells still is a crucial issue for many applications in different fields [3], such as industrial manufacturing [4], botany [5], biology [6], veterinary medicine [7], and human medicine [8]. In oncology, for example, live and dead cell counting is typically performed to monitor the viability of cancer cells after different chemical [9] or radiobiological treatments [10]. Count accuracy can strongly influence the choice of treatment [11] and also lead to adjustments in the chemotherapeutic protocol [12] and in the drugs dosage administered to the patient [13].At present, a wide number of methods and systems are available for cell counting [14] ranging from fully automated commercial instruments [15] and flow cytometry systems [16], to image processing methods [17] also embedded in software provided in bundle with automated microscope or image acquisition systems [18]. New approaches are constantly being developed [19]. However, the original method of manual cell counting using a hemocytometer and a manual tally counter together with a light widefield microscope, the most widely used approach over the last three decades [4], still represents the gold standard [20] as well as the predominant method [21]. A recent study reports that more than 70% of operators use a hemocytometer each day for counting cells [22]. Nonetheless, the use of a hemocytometer and a tally counter leads to subjectivity [21] and, if more operators are used to improve accuracy, overall reliability may be jeopardized by cell conditions changing between counts.In this work we present a computer vision-based approach to improve reproducibility (inter-rater reliability) and repeatability (intra-rater reliability) of the gold standard counting method. In particular, we propose a non-invasive method to “freeze” the status of the cells in the hemocytometer that can then be used for repeated counting by one or more operators, independently of each other. This is achieved through GridMos (http://sourceforge.net/p/gridmos), a multi-image based method written in MATLAB (©, The MathWorks, Inc., MA, USA), that yields one high resolution mosaic [23] from several images depicting overlapping parts of the whole hemocytometer's grid. The procedure of “fusing” several images into only one has various names, e.g. image registration, aligning, or, more generically, mosaicing [24]. In particular, the mosaicing methods permit to overcome the trade-off between pixel resolution and width of sensor's Field Of View (FOV, area of the sample represented into the image [25]) obtaining one final large image. Furthermore, counting cells using a single mosaic rather than a set of images, provides a more robust approach to solve the problem of establishing a priori a representative field of the whole sample [26] and preventing double counts, for instance in case of same cells repeated between images or at the edge of the different FOVs [27].Images in histology and cytology are normally obtained by using a light widefield microscope [28], which is not typically endowed with motorized stage [29]. Accordingly, several mosaicing software tools are typically used to obtain a mosaic of a set of overlapping images manually acquired. The first solution is offered by tools needing a manual outline of the images layout to achieve the final mosaic, such as MosaicJ[30]. Alternatively, in other tools such as Hugin panorama stitching software (http://sourceforge.net/p/hugin), the registration scheme is defined by selecting one of the available models, that however are not suitable for the hemocytometer's grid. Finally, several fully-automatic solutions have been then proposed to obtain mosaics without requiring any prior information [31,32]. However, these tools typically fail when used to registered images with highly repeated patterns only, such as the squared blocks of an empty hemocytometer's grid. In general, very few stitching tools can be used with effectiveness also to obtain a mosaic of microscopy images [33], Microsoft Image Composite Editor (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/ICE/) and Autostich[34] among them, originally proposed for outdoor image mosaics. Nevertheless, registration and image blending are not fully described in Microsoft Image Composite Editor[35] and Autostich forces on adopting a homographic registration model, often degenerating in a distorted mosaic when used with hemocytometer's images. Furthermore, some of these methods fail to define the correct shift between the images to be stitched when reference features are not marked, as in the case of images characterized by a very low contrast (e.g., brightfield images of cells [36]).GridMos has been designed specifically to automatically obtain mosaics of hemocytometer's images acquired by manually moving the sample holder of the microscope. In practice, it is an extension of the mosaicing method presented in one of our previous studies [31] as regards the spatial registration strategy that we implemented from scratch to correctly stitch images with repeated patterns. In particular, to determine where the images must be stitched, the overlapping region between each pair of subsequent images is analyzed to detect meaningful correspondences and, consequently, the right spatial shift considering the first image acquired as the reference one. In practice, in order to accurately register the images of the hemocytometer's grid, we devised and implemented a proper frequency domain approach based on the analysis of the peaks of phase correlation. Furthermore, we developed an effective “blending” technique to make the final mosaic seamless and consistent so as to fix the problem of visible seams in the stitching zones (i.e., colours inhomogeneity and vignetting [37]), which could lead to incorrect cell counting, above all in automatic methods [38]. As a matter of fact, manual counting is a very tedious task and often operators when possible try exploiting, in the very early stage, automatic software to assist them in tagging what, at a first sight, appear to be single cells.In our counting approach, once achieved the mosaic of the whole hemocytometer's grid (obtained with GridMos or, in principle, with other software tools considered accurate enough for one's own purposes), an image editor software is used to count the cells by manually adding flags of different colours [39]. The idea to count the cells by tagging an image is not new [40]. Many works report comparisons of automatic image processing methods with or the manual cell counting performed by looking to the microscope's oculars [41], or by tagging an image [42]. It is worth mentioning the work of Drury et al.[43], where counts performed by using labelled images where compared to counts obtained by looking at the same images and counting visually trough a manual tally counter (i.e., without adding flags). Nevertheless, two operators only were enrolled to count, and they did not even analyzed live and dead cells separately. Recently, Young et al.[44] improved the statistics by asking four operators to count, but they did not report results regarding either inter-observer variability or dead cells. In conclusion, no statistical analyses have been reported in literature to extensively compare the gold standard method with an approach based on a labelled mosaic. Neither, live and dead cells have been ever considered separately.In this work, we compared the outcome of the proposed mosaic-based approach and of the gold standard method, by separately considering live and dead cells, also reporting reproducibility and repeatability statistical analysis. In particular, in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed counting approach we performed two sets of experiments by counting cells of different cancer lines. In the first experiment, seven expert operators counted sequentially in blind the live and dead cells in two samples, the first time according to the gold standard method and then using the mosaic. In the second experiment, three operators counted the cells of their own grid three times. Finally, we asked one expert operator to count five times the same sample, also acquiring a new image set between each manual counting step. The obtained results prove that the reliability markedly improves when counting is performed using our proposed approach. Accordingly, the proposed approach may be suggested as the best likely candidate for the new gold standard method in cell counting.The next sections are organized as follows. Section 2 presents a short overview of the most widely used counting devices and methods. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed counting approach is reported. Section 4 describes the materials used in the experiments, whose results are presented in Section 5 and amply discussed in Section 6.A revolutionary breakthrough in cell counting was provided by the Coulter system, developed more than 50 years ago by Wallace Coulter (1913–1998) [45]. The technique involves the application of an electric field across a micron-sized aperture and a hydrodynamic system to guide single particles through the aperture. The occlusion of the aperture yields a measurable change in the electric impedance that can be directly correlated to the size and, indirectly, to the presence of a cell. The Coulter system opened the doors to the derived technology, the flow cytometry [46], where the cell suspension is convolved into a stream of fluid passing through a very sensitive laser-based detection apparatus [20]. Cytometry represents the most versatile solution to analyze a wide range of cell characteristics: fluorescence dyes are typically added to the culture to highlight live and dead cells [47] as well as to study different chemical–biological features [48]. Several problems limit the usage of a flow cytometer. First and foremost, not all the laboratories can afford a flow cytometry system: in addition to be fairly expensive [49], it requires an expert technician for both usage and maintenance [50]. Furthermore, the sample analyzed must be a suspension of single cells [16], since aggregates can damage the system and compromise the analysis. Furthermore, thousands of cells are required for each analysis in order to obtain reliable data [22]. In practice, flow cytometry is not used routinely when the main purpose is limited to counting live and dead cells.A further method for counting cells is represented by dedicated devices designed specifically for this purpose [51], i.e., the so-called “cell counters” available from different companies (e.g., we normally use NucleoCounter®[52], ChemoMetec, Allerod, Denmark). Although these instruments exploit different technologies and physical properties, all of them were conceived to count multiple single-cell samples [21]. They are also a very rapid way of counting cells. However, many laboratories do not use these devices because of their accuracy is limited to a specific range of cells. Currently, the most widely used approach to cell counting is still manual counting performed using a hemocytometer.Different types of commercial hemocytometer chambers are available, e.g. Burker (Rogo-Sampaic, Wissous, France), Newbauer (Rogo-Sampaic), Nageotte (Hausser Scientific Company, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA) and Fuch-Rosenthal (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania, USA) [53]. These devices basically differ in terms of material, type of ruled area and cover slip. However, they all work in the same way: the counting chamber is delineated by a grid (impressed or painted) containing a fixed sample volume. The operator counts the cells inside the grid where the dead ones are typically highlighted using Trypan Blue [54]. The number of live and dead cells present in the whole culture is finally obtained by multiplying the number of counted cells by the dilution factor used. Despite its simplicity, several problems affect the manual counting procedure [55]. First of all, these counts are performed manually and are thus they are labour intensive [56] and operator dependent [57]. Some authors report that manual counting produces standard deviations of 5–10% by skilled operators [58]. Furthermore, when both live and dead cell analyses are performed, keeping the sample reading time to a minimum is crucial. In fact, during the analysis the sample dries out, the cells die and the Trypan Blue diffuses into the culture medium. In addition to being time-consuming in itself (approximately 20min are needed to count 2000 cells [44]), manual counting is also a tedious task [59], which slows down the entire process. Often, it is possible to count only once before the sample starts changing and the counts are not repeatable, accordingly. In addition, if several samples need to be counted, the microscope position is kept busy, preventing other operators from using it.Several image processing methods have been developed to count cells in on assisted [60] or automatic way [26] using hemocytometer [61] or multi-well plate images [62]. For example, Mahmood and co-workers [63] exploit the Hough transform [64] to extract circular objects considered to be the cells. Other commonly used processing techniques involve watershed segmentation [65], image thresholding [66] and morphological operators [67]. Although all of these methods are appealing, they fail to discriminate accurately between cells of different shapes, live and dead cells and small aggregates. For example, the algorithm proposed in [52], albeit capable of automatically detecting, counting and tracking cells, may fail in the presence of cell aggregates. Numerous other solutions have also been proposed to better classify the different cells, but all of them are characterized by constraints that limit their applicability. For instance, Allalou and co-workers [68] proposed a user-friendly software for counting cells, which, however, works for fluorescence images only. More recently, Huth and co-workers [36] proposed a very interesting MATLAB tool to count cells also in phase-contrast and DIC images. However, the accuracy of the methods to automatically separate live and dead cells, debris and impurities or dust on the lens requires more in-depth analysis. Finally, Geissmann [17] proposed OpenCFU, a robust software able to count cells also in brightfield images containing grids and debris. Nevertheless, OpenCFU does not differentiate live and dead cells. Furthermore, the count accuracy is affected by colour inhomogeneity of the image, and problems such as vignetting could mislead the entire analysis. In conclusion, the approaches based on image processing methods typically provide rapid solutions for counting cells [69]. Nevertheless, there is still no general image-based method capable of accurately counting both live and dead cells, of all possible cell typologies (i.e., cells with different size and different morphologies of dead cells), in a typical situation where the images present debris and colour inhomogeneity. Thus, for the above reasons, manual counting using a hemocytometer still represents the gold standard.
