@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR), whose all elements are measured by an unsymmetrical scale (Saaty's 1–9 scale) instead of the symmetrical scale in the intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (IFPR), is suitable for describing the asymmetric preference information. In decision making process, one of the most crucial issues is how to rank alternatives from the given preference relation constructed by the decision maker. In this paper, two approaches are proposed for deriving the ranking orders of the alternatives from two different angles. To do it, a transformation mechanism is developed to transform an IMPR to a corresponding IFPR, and then all alternatives depicted by the given IMPR can be ranked via solving a familiar IFPR. In addition, the generalized intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted averaging (GIMOWA) and the geometric (GIMOWG) operators are given by taking fully account of the different weights associated with the particular ordered positions and their desirable properties are also discussed. After that, through a practical example, the proposed approaches are compared with the previous work and a numerical analysis of the results is also given.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In a decision making problem, a finite set of alternatives is usually to be evaluated and ranked, and perhaps at least one decision maker (DM) is invited to provide his/her preferences over the alternatives. A common way to settle the problem contains two steps: The first step called “construction step” is to construct a preference relation which is the most usual case to represent the DM's preferences, and the second one called “exploitation step” is to rank the alternatives from the constructed preference relation. In the “construction step”, the DM compares the considered alternatives by pairs, and constructs a preference relation. There are two of the most widely used preference relations: the fuzzy preference relation [1] and multiplicative preference relation [2]. A fuzzy preference relation is defined as a complementary matrix which assumes that the grades between “Extremely not preferred” and “Extremely preferred” are distributed uniformly and symmetrically; while a multiplicative preference relation is defined as a reciprocal matrix which is not uniform and symmetrical [3–7]. In addition, all elements in a fuzzy and multiplicative preference relation are only characterized by a membership function describing the strength that one alternative is preferred to another, and cannot consider the degree that one alternative is not preferred to another. To solve such cases, the intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (IFPR) [8] and the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) [9] are defined to simultaneously depict the degree that one alternative is preferred to another and the degree that one alternative is not preferred to another. Especially, the IMPR recently proposed by Xia et al. [9] can deal with the unbalanced distribution commonly found in real-life. One example is the law of diminishing marginal utility in economics [9–11]. When increasing the same amount of investment, a company with worse performance yields more utility than that with better performance. Another example is the rain attenuation prediction for satellite communication. According to the prediction model in ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union-Radio Communication Sector) [12], with improving a certain frequency, it increases more rain attenuation in the higher operating frequencies than in the lower frequencies, and causes more cost to compensate the signal outage. Generally speaking, sometimes the gap between the grades expressing good information should be larger than the one between the grades reflecting bad information. Due to the advantages of IMPRs, it is necessary and interesting to investigate the approaches for ranking alternatives from IMPRs in decision making. Up to now, some works have been achieved: Xia et al. [9] introduced the concept of IMPR and developed the aggregation principle of the intuitionistic multiplicative preference information for decision making; Xu [13] developed a method to derive the priority weights of the objects from an IMPR; Jiang et al. [10] defined the compatibility measure for IMPRs and developed two consensus models for group decision making; Xia and Xu [11] introduced some intuitionistic multiplicative aggregation operators and applied them into group decision making with IMPRs. Based on algebraic operational laws, Yu and Fang [14] developed some intuitionistic multiplicative aggregation operators and introduced a method for group decision making with IMPRs.It is noticed that, especially in the “exploitation step” with IMPRs, most of the above work focuses on the aggregation operators, and most of these aggregation operators take little account of the different weights of the particular ordered positions of alternatives (except the intuitionistic multiplicative order weighted averaging operator based on algebraic operational laws (A-IMOWA operator) proposed by Yu and Fang [14]). Different from IMPRs, series of papers [11,15–21] have developed various exploitation techniques (rather than aggregation operators) for ranking alternatives based on IFPRs. Hence, one aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between IMPRs and IFPRs. Then the existing work on the IFPRs can be applied into dealing with the IMPRs by taking use of such relationship. Another aim of this paper is to introduce some “ordered” weighted operators which are helpful for relieving the influence of unfair information by assigning low weights to those “biased” arguments, like the generalized intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted averaging (GIMOWA) and the geometric (GIMOWG) operators, by extending the results in Xia et al. [9]. To do this, the rest of the paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 reviews some basic knowledge. In Section 3, a transformation mechanism between IMPRs and IFPRs is proposed, based on which, an approach for ranking alternatives in decision making with IMPRs is presented. In Section 4, some new ordered weighted aggregation operators for aggregating intuitionistic multiplicative information are developed and applied to derive the ranking of the given alternatives. Section 5 provides a practical example to illustrate the proposed methods and compare them with the previous work. Concluding remarks and further research directions are included in Section 6.To facilitate the presentation, firstly, some basic definitions and concepts are reviewed. For simplicity, this paper denotesN={1,2,…,n},M={1,2,…,m}andX={x1,x2,…xn}.Definition 2.1[1]. A fuzzy preference relation R on the set X is defined as a reciprocal complementary matrixR=(rij)n×n⊂X×X, which satisfiesDifferent from the fuzzy preference relation which uses the 0–1 scale, the multiplicative preference relation is measured by the 1/9–9 scale (also called Saaty's 1–9 scale) as follows:Definition 2.2[2]. A multiplicative preference relation P on the set X is defined as a reciprocal matrixP=(pij)n×n⊂X×X, which satisfiesThis paper focuses on the multiplicative preference relations in which all information is measured by the 1/9–9 scale, whose meanings are listed in Table 1.Form Table 1, it is easily found that pij=1 indicates indifference between xiand xj; pij>1 indicates the degree that xiis preferred to xj, the greater pij, the stronger the preference intensity of xiover xj, especially pij=9 indicates that xiis extremely preferred to xj; pij<1 means that the degree that xjis preferred to xi, the smaller pij, the stronger the preference intensity of xjover xi, especially pij=1/9 means that xjis extremely preferred to xi.By considering the non-membership information in the fuzzy preference relation, the IFPR is defined as follows:Definition 2.3[8]. An intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation (IFPR) B on the set X is represented by a matrixB=(bij)n×n, wherebij=(μbij,νbij)is an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) for alli,j∈N, andμbijis the certainty degree to which xiis preferred to xj,νbijis the certainty degree to which xiis not preferred to xjand both of them satisfyFor convenience,bij=(μbij,νbij)is denoted asbij=(μij,νij)without ambiguity. Moreover,πij=1−μij−νijindicates the uncertainty degree to which xiis preferred to xj.To extend the traditional multiplicative preference relation by adding a non-membership function, Xia et al. [9] introduced the concept of IMPR. Similarly, for convenience, in this paper,αij=(ραij,σαij)is denoted asαij=(ρij,σij)without ambiguity.Definition 2.4[9]. An intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) on the set X is defined asA=(αij)n×n, whereαij=(ρij,σij)is an intuitionistic multiplicative number (IMN), for alli,j∈N, andρijindicates the intensity to which xiis preferred to xj,σijindicates the intensity to which xiis not preferred to xj, and both of them should satisfy the following conditions:Obviously, the fundamental elements of an IMPR are IMNs. How to rank two IMNs is vital to obtain the priorities of alternatives from an IMPR. For comparing any two IMNs, Xia et al. [9] defined the following comparison laws:Definition 2.5[9]. For an IMNα=(ρα,σα),s(α)=ρα/σαis the score function of α, andh(α)=ρασαis the accuracy function of α. Then the following laws are given to compare two IMNs α1 and α2:Ifs(α1)>s(α2), thenα1>α2;Ifs(α1)=s(α2), thenIfh(α1)>h(α2), thenα1>α2;Ifh(α1)=h(α2), thenα1=α2.Xia et al. also proved thatα1=α2if and only ifρ1=ρ2andσ1=σ2[9]. Obviously, the largest and smallest IMNs are (9,1/9) and (1/9,9), respectively, which were called as the top and bottom IMNs in [10].Furthermore, some operational laws are defined as follows:Definition 2.6[9]. Let α, α1 and α2 be three IMNs, thenαc=(σα,ρα);α1∧α2=(min{ρ1,ρ2},max{σ1,σ2});α1∨α2=(max{ρ1,ρ2},min{σ1,σ2});α1⊕α2=(1+2ρ1)(1+2ρ2)−12,2σ1σ2(2+σ1)(2+σ2)−σ1σ2;α1⊗α2=2ρ1ρ2(2+ρ1)(2+ρ2)−ρ1ρ2,(1+2σ1)(1+2σ2)−12;λα=(1+2ρα)λ−12,2σαλ(2+σα)λ−σαλ;αλ=2ραλ(2+ρα)λ−ραλ,(1+2σα)λ−12.In real life, it is quite natural to consider the DMs’ preferences which are provided by means of different numerical scales. Usually in intuitionistic environment, there are two types of preference relations: IMPRs and IFPRs. On one hand, the preferences evaluated by the DMs are characterized by their own ideas, attitudes, motivations and personality, so sometimes they include both intuitionistic fuzzy preferences and intuitionistic multiplicative preferences in a same decision making process. In such situations, especially in group decision making problems, before carrying on exploitation process, the given information should be uniform. On the other hand, since the IFPR was presented by Xu [8], it has been considered as a useful tool in modeling decision processes as discussed above. Thus, it provides us a new train of thought for ranking alternatives from IMPRs by utilizing the existing methods based on IFPRs. Next, what should be focused on is to probe the relationship between IMPRs and IFPRs which is not only necessary to derive the ranking of alternatives from the IMPRs, but also to make the decision information uniform. A 2-tuple IMN(ρij,σij)can be rewritten as a 3-tuple IMN by addingτijthat indicates the uncertainty (or hesitation) degree to which xiis preferred to xj, then an IMN is represented as(ρij,σij,τij), with the conditions:1/9≤ρij,σij≤9andρij⋅σij⋅τij=1, for alli,j∈N. The two types of representations are absolutely equal to each other.In general, if(1)A′={A=(αij)n×n=(ρij,σij,τij)n×n|ρij=σji,σij=ρji,τij=τji,ρij⋅σij⋅τij=1,ρij,σij∈[1/9,9],ρij⋅σij<1,i,j∈N}is the set of IMPRs, and(2)B′={B=(bij)n×n=(μij,νij,πij)n×n|μij=νji,νij=μji,πij=πji,μij+νij+πij=1,μij,νij∈[0,1],μij+νij<1,i,j∈N}is the set of IFPRs, then it should look for a way to achieve the transformation:A′→B′. Assume that there exist three continuous functions on X:(3)f:[1/9,9]→[0,1],f(ρij)=μijg:[1/9,9]→[0,1],g(σij)=υijh:[1,81]→[0,1],h(τij)=πij,foralli,j∈Nwhich should satisfyf(9)=1andf(1)=1/2.Based on Eqs. (1) and (2), it is easily obtained thatf(x)=g(x)andf(x)+g(y)=1−h(1/xy). Letl(t)=1−h(1/t), then the following equation is valid:(4)f(x)+f(y)=l(xy)It is noticed that Eq. (4) is a specific form of the well-known Pexider's function equation [22]s(xy)=m(x)+n(y), whose general solution iss(t)=cln(αβt)m(t)=cln(αt)n(t)=cln(βt),α>0,β>0,t>0for positive x and y, with constantc∈ℜ.Thus, according to Eqs. (3) and (4), the following relationships hold:(5)α=β,f(t)=cln(αt),l(t)=cln(α2t)Due tof(9)=1andf(1)=1/2, it can be obtained thatα=9andc=1/(2ln9).Then the solution of Eq. (4) isf(x)=ln(9x)2ln9=12(1+log9x),l(x)=ln(81x)2ln9=1+12log9xTherefore, three transformation functions can be derived as follows:f(x)=12(1+log9x),g(x)=12(1+log9x),h(x)=12log9xSummarizing, the following result can be given:Proposition 1Suppose that X is a finite set of alternatives, and associated with it an IMPRA=αijn×n=ρij,σij,τijn×n. Then the corresponding IFPRB=bijn×n=μij,νij,πijn×nassociated with A is given through three transformation functions as follows:The following example is given to illustrate the transformation mechanism:Example 1LetThe transformation functions act as a bridge between intuitionistic multiplicative information and intuitionistic fuzzy information. Lots of the existing work on IFPRs can be applied to accommodate IMPRs, such as: the distance measure, the similarity measure, the consistency analysis, and so on.Based on the transformation functions, a method for ranking the given alternatives from an IMPR can be presented by using the corresponding method with an IFPR.Step 1. Utilize the transformation functions (Eq. (6)) to transform the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation A into an intuitionistic preference relation B.Step 2. Utilize the IFOWA operator [6]:(7)biIFOWA=IFOWA(bi1,bi2,…,bin)=1−∏j=1n(1−μb˙ij)ωj,∏j=1n(vb˙ij)ωj,∏j=1n(1−μb˙ij)ωj−∏j=1n(vb˙ij)ωjor the IFOWG operator [23]:(8)biIFOWG=IFOWG(bi1,bi2,…,bin)=∏j=1n(μb˙ij)ωj,1−∏j=1n(1−vb˙ij)ωj,∏j=1n(1−vb˙ij)ωj−∏j=1n(μb˙ij)ωjto aggregate all bijto the averaged IFN bicorresponding to the alternative xi, for alli,j∈N, where(b˙i1,b˙i2,…,b˙in)is a permutation of(bi1,bi2,…,bin), such thatb˙i1≥b˙i2≥,…,≥b˙in, andω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tis the weighting vector of the ordered positions of(b˙i1,b˙i2,…,b˙in)withωj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nωj=1, which can be determined by using some weight determining methods like the normal distribution based method [24,25]. In addition, to compare any two IFNs, the score function is defined ass(bij)=μij−νijand the accuracy function is defined ash(bij)=μij+νij[8].Step 3. Calculate the values of the score and accuracy functions of bi(i=1,2,…,n).Step 4. Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1,2,…,n) in accordance with the ranking of bi.Step 5. End.Next, an example adopted from [17] is offered to illustrate Procedure I.Example 2Assume that an investor wants to invest some money in an enterprise in order to get the highest possible profit. Initially, he/she considers five possible alternatives: x1 is a clothing company, x2 is a fishing company, x3 is a seed company, x4 is a feed company and x5 is a building materials company. In order to prioritize these five possible alternativesX={x1,x2,x3,x4,x5}, a DM is invited to assess them. The DM compares each pair of these alternatives and provides his/her preferences contained in an IMPRA=(αij)5×5:Then Procedure I can be employed to rank these alternatives. The details are discussed as follows:Step 1. Utilize the transformation functions Eq. (6) to transform the given IMPRA=(αij)5×5into an IFPRB=(bij)5×5:B=(0.5,0.5,0)(0.250,0.658,0.092)(0.291,0.658,0.051)(0.250,0.250,0.500)(0.250,0.500,0.250)(0.658,0.250,0.092)(0.5,0.5,0)(0.866,0,0.134)(0.435,0.092,0.473)(0.342,0.342,0.316)(0.658,0.291,0.051)(0,0.866,0.134)(0.5,0.5,0)(0.185,0.750,0.065)(0.057,0.750,0.193)(0.250,0.250,0.500)(0.092,0.435,0.473)(0.750,0.185,0.065)(0.5,0.5,0)(0.158,0.750,0.092)(0.500,0.250,0.250)(0.342,0.342,0.316)(0.750,0.057,0.193)(0.750,0.158,0.092)(0.5,0.5,0)Step 2. Suppose that the weighting vectorω=(1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5)T, then the IFOWA operator reduces to the IFWA operator. By using Eq. (7) to aggregate all bijcorresponding to the alternativexi(i,j=1,2,3,4,5), it can be obtained that:b1IFWA=(0.316,0.486,0.198),b2IFWA=(0.615,0,0.385),b3IFWA=(0.334,0.589,0.077),b4IFWA=(0.410,0.376,0.214)b5IFWA=(0.600,0.207,0.193)Step 3. Calculate the scores of bi(i=1,2,3,4,5):s(b1IFWA)=−0.170,s(b2IFWA)=0.614,s(b3IFWA)=−0.255,s(b4IFWA)=0.033,s(b5IFWA)=0.392and thenb2>b5>b4>b1>b3, by which the alternatives can be ranked:x2≻x5≻x4≻x1≻x3.Similarly, since the weights of all alternatives are equal, the IFOWG operator reduces to the IFWG operator. In Step 2, instead of the IFOWA operator, if the IFOWG operator (Eq. (8)) is used, thenb1IFWG=(0.296,0.534,0.170),b2IFWG=(0.531,0.259,0.210),b3IFWG=(0,0.688,0.312),b4IFWG=(0.267,0.467,0.266)b5IFWG=(0.545,0.278,0.177)Step 3. Calculate the scores of bi(i=1,2,3,4,5):s(b1IFWG)=−0.238,s(b2IFWG)=0.273,s(b3IFWG)=−0.688,s(b4IFWG)=−0.199,s(b5IFWG)=0.267and thenb2>b5>b4>b1>b3, thus the same ranking order of the given alternatives can be obtained:x2≻x5≻x4≻x1≻x3.It is well known that the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator first introduced by Yager [26] has achieved successful applications in many domains [6,26–30]. An OWA operator of dimension n is a mapping:Rn→R, havingOWA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑i=1nwia˙i, wherea˙iis the ith largest element in the collectiona1,a2,⋯,an. aiis not associated with a particular weight wi, but rather wiis associated with a particular ordered position. The OWA operator has desirable characteristics which are monotonic, bounded, idempotent and commutative [26] and its many extensions have been implemented in the last few decades, including the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator [26], the uncertain generalized ordered weighted averaging (UGOWA) operator [30], the ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator [31], the ordered weighted harmonic averaging (OWHA) operator [32], the ordered weighted quadratic averaging (OWQA) operator [32], the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator [6,21], the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging (IFOWG) operator [23], etc. It should be pointed out that these ordered weighted operators are different from those “non-ordered” ones in that coefficients are not associated directly with a particular element but rather to an ordered position. Thus they are helpful in relieving the influence of unfair information by assigning low weights to those “false” or “biased” arguments.In the following, some new operators to aggregate IMNs are developed, whose fundamental characteristics are also the reordering steps, and then discuss their desirable properties. Let M be the set of all IMNs.Definition 4.1Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, a generalized intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted averaging (GIMOWA) operator is a mapping:Mn→Msuch thatLetαi(i∈N)be a collection of IMNs,λ>0andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe their weight vector withwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1, thenEspecially, ifw=1/n,1/n,…,1/nT, then the GIMOWA operator reduces to the GIMA operator [9]. Moreover, whenλ=1, then the following operator can be defined:Definition 4.2Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, an intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted averaging (IMOWA) operator is a mapping:Mn→Msuch thatBased on Theorem 4.1, the following theorem can be obtained:Theorem 4.2Letαi(i=1,2,⋯,n)be a collection of IMNs, andw=w1,w2,⋯,wnTbe their weight vector withwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1, thenNext, if we give a further extension of the GIMWG operator, and another operator can be got:Definition 4.3Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, a generalized intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted geometric (GIMOWG) operator is a mappingMn→M, such thatLetαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs,λ>0andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe their weight vector withwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1, thenEspecially, ifw=(1/n,1/n,…,1/n)T, then the GIMOWG operator reduces to the generalized intuitionistic multiplicative geometric (GIMG) operator. Furthermore, ifλ=1, then the following definition can be given:Definition 4.4Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, an intuitionistic multiplicative ordered weighted geometric (IMOWG) operator is a mapping:Mn→Msuch thatSimilar to Theorem 4.2, the following theorem can be given:Theorem 4.4Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe their weight vector withwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1, thenLetα1=(1/8,3)andα2=(3,1/6)be two IMNs,w=(0.3,0.7)Tbe the weight vector of αi(i=1,2) andλ=2, then based on Definition 2.5, the reordered ranking is obtainedα˙1=α2=(3,1/6)andα˙2=α1=(1/8,3). In what follows, the GIMOWA and GIMOWG operators are used to aggregate α1 and α2, respectively:Use the GIMOWA operator (Eq. (10)) to aggregate the given IMNs, thenUse the GIMOWG operator (Eq. (14)) to aggregate the given IMNs, thenIn what follows, some desirable properties of the developed operators are discussed (for convenience, here only the IMOWA operator is taken for instance):Property 1Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, andα′(i=1,2,…,n)be any permutation of the elements inαi(i=1,2,…,n), thenIfα˙iis the ith largest of αiandα˙′iis the ith largest ofα′i, respectively, thenα˙i=α˙′i. Hence,IMOWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=IMOWA(α′1,α′2,…,α′n). This completes the proof.□It is noted that this operator exhibits the kind of symmetry implied by equal importance of alternatives which is similar to the OWA operator.Property 2Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, if allαi(i=1,2,…,n)are equal, namelyαi=α=(ρα,σα), for all i, thenIn [9], the partial order between two IMNs α1 and α2 was defined asα1≥Pα2, if and only ifρ1≥ρ2andσ1≤σ2. Especiallyα1=α2, if and only ifρ1=ρ2andσ1=σ2.Property 3Let αiandα′i(i=1,2,…,n)be two collections of IMNs, ifαi≤Pα′ifor all i, thenFor two collections of IMNs αiandα′i(i=1,2,…,n), ifαi≤Pα′ifor all i, then obviously,α˙i≤Pα′˙i, for all i, that isρα˙i≤ρα′˙iandσα˙i≥σα′˙i, whereα˙iis the ith largest of αiandα˙′iis the ith largest ofα′i, and thusTherefore,IMOWA(α1,α2,…,αn)≤IMOWA(α′1,α′2,…,α′n). This completes the proof.□Property 4Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IMNs, andLetαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collections of IMNs,w=w1,w2,…,wnTbe the weight vector of them such thatwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1. Ifk>0, thenIt follows from Definition 2.6 thatLetαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collections of IMNs,w=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe the weight vector of them such thatwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1. Ifα′=(ρα′,σα′)is an IMN, thenIt follows from Definition 2.6 thatThus, Eq. (22) holds. This completes the proof.□Property 7Letαi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collections of IMNs,w=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe the weight vector of them such thatwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1. Ifk>0,α′=(ρα′,σα′)is an IMN, thenIt follows from Definition 2.6 thatHence, Eq. (23) holds. This completes the proof.□In the “exploitation step” for ranking alternatives, the key of Procedure I presented in Ref. [9] is to utilize the GIMWA or GIMWG operator to get the averaged IMN of each alternative over all the other alternatives. It is easy to notice that the GIMWA and GIMWG operators weight the aggregated IMNs themselves not considering the positions of the aggregated IMNs. However, in practical decision making problems, some unfair preference results cannot be avoided because of time pressure, lack of knowledge and the DM's limited expertise related to the problems. Therefore in some situations different importance degrees of different positions should be taken into account. One direct method is weighting the positions of the aggregated IMNs instead of weighting the aggregated IMNs themselves and the new aggregation operators given above can achieve this aim. Next by using the GIMOWA and GIMOWG operators, a new ranking method of alternatives is presented and the details are discussed as follows:Step 1. Utilize the GIMOWA operator (Eq. (10)) or the GIMOWG operator (Eq. (14)) to aggregate allαijto get the averaged IMNαicorresponding to the alternative xi, for alli,j∈N, where(α˙i1,α˙i2,…,α˙in)is a permutation of(αi1,αi2,…,αin), such thatα˙i1≥α˙i2≥,…,≥α˙in, andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weighting vector of the ordered positions of(α˙i1,α˙i2,…,α˙i,n−1), wherewj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nwj=1.Step 2. Based on Definition 2.5, calculate the values of the score and accuracy functions of αi(i=1,2,…,n).Step 3. Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1,2,…,n) according to the ranking of αi.Step 4. End.Procedure II utilizes the GIMOWA or GIMOWG operator to aggregate all the IMNs corresponding to an alternative into the averaged IMN. The prominent characteristic of this procedure is that it first reorders all the input arguments, and then weights the ordered positions of the arguments, which can relieve the influence of unfair information by assigning low weights to those “false” or “biased” ones.In what follows, a simple example to illustrate Procedure II and more analysis with respect to the proposed aggregation operators are given, especially the parameter λ in them.Example 4LetA=(αij)3×3be an IMPR on the set of three alternativesX={x1,x2,x3}:Step 1. Suppose that the weighting vectorw=1/3,1/3,1/3Tandλ=1, based on Procedure II, utilize the GIMOWA operator to aggregate allαijinto the averaged IMNαiGIMOWAcorresponding to the alternatives xi(i=1,2,3):α1GIMOWA=(3.886,0.235),α2GIMOWA=(0.383,1.585),α3GIMOWA=(0.631,0.884).Step 2. Based on Definition 2.5, calculate the scores ofαiGIMOWA(i=1,2,3):s(α1GIMOWA)=16.499,s(α2GIMOWA)=0.241,s(α3GIMOWA)=0.714thusα1>α3>α2.Step 3. Rank all the alternatives xiaccording to the ranking of αi(i=1,2,3):x1≻x3≻x2.In the following, the GIMOWG operator (Eq. (14)) instead of the GIMOWA operator is used to aggregate all αijinto the averaged IMNαiGIMOWAcorresponding to the alternatives xi(i=1,2,3):α1GIMOWG=(2.836,0.338),α2GIMOWG=(0.285,2.065),α3GIMOWG=(0.484,1.536)Then the scores ofαiGIMOWG(i=1,2,3)can be calculated:s(α1GIMOWG)=8.380,s(α2GIMOWG)=0.138,s(α2GIMOWG)=0.315thusα1>α3>α2, and the same ranking can be obtainedx1≻x3≻x2.In the above analyses, λ equals to one. Actually, the parameter λ can be assigned different values according to real problems. In the following, λ is assigned randomly different values in the interval (0,9], and calculate the scores of these three alternatives. The variations can be found clearly with respect to the values of the parameter λ in Figs. 1–4.Fig. 1 illustrates the scores ofαi(i=1,2,3)by using the GIMOWA operator, in which the scores increase as the values of the parameter λ increasing from 0 to 9. The scores of α2 are very close to ones of α3, for clear observation, Fig. 2 is given. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the scores of αiby using the GIMOWG operator. Contrary to the GIMOWA operator, the scores obtained by the GIMOWG operator decrease with the increase of the parameter λ. Similarly, the scores of α2 are very close to ones of α3, more details are presented in Fig. 4. In addition, it can be observed from Figs. 1–4 that most of the scores calculated by the GIMOWA operator are much bigger than the ones calculated by the GIMOWG operator, and the deviations become larger as the value of the parameter λ becomes bigger.Similar to Example 2, the investment example in [17] is adopted to illustrate the proposed methods:Example 5Consider that the weight vector of the five alternativesX={x1,x2,x3,x4,x5}isw=(1/10,4/10,3/10,1/10,1/10)T, and the given IMPR by the DM:Firstly, Procedure II is employed to rank these alternatives:Step 1. Choose the GIMOWA operator to aggregate all αij(i,j=1,2,3,4,5) corresponding to the alternatives xi(without loss of generality, letλ=1):α1GIMOWA=(0.437,0.600),α2GIMOWA=(1.588,0.206),α3GIMOWA=(0.621,1.352),α4GIMOWA=(0.735,0.494)α5GIMOWA=(1.956,0.238)Step 2. Based on Definition 2.5, calculate the scores ofαiGIMOWA(i=1,2,3,4,5):s(α1GIMOWA)=0.729,s(α2GIMOWA)=7.695,s(α3GIMOWA)=0.459,s(α4GIMOWA)=1.486,s(α5GIMOWA)=8.217thusα5>α2>α4>α1>α3.Step 3. Rank all the alternatives xiaccording to the ranking order of αi(i=1,2,3,4,5):x5≻x2≻x4≻x1≻x3.Secondly, Yu and Fang [14]’s method is utilized to deal with this issue in order to make a comparison with our method. In Ref.[14], another aggregation operator based on the algebraic operational laws was proposed as follows:(24)A−IMOWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=∏i=1n(1+ρα˙i)wi−1,∏i=1nσα˙iwi∏i=1n(1+σα˙i)wi−∏i=1nσα˙iwiStep 1. Utilize the A-IMOWA operator to aggregate all αij(i,j=1,2,3,4,5) and get the aggregated IMNαiA−IMOWA, wherew=1/10,4/10,3/10,1/10,1/10T:α1A−IMOWA=(0.436,0.599),α2A−IMOWA=(1.591,0.212),α3A−IMOWA=(0.649,1.318),α4A−IMOWA=(0.762,0.494)α5A−IMOWA=(1.946,0.246)Step 2. Calculate the scores ofαiA−IMOWA(i=1,2,3,4,5)according to Definition 2.5:s(α1A−IMOWA)=0.728,s(α2A−IMOWA)=7.498,s(α3A−IMOWA)=0.493,s(α4A−IMOWA)=1.541,s(α5A−IMOWA)=7.920thusα5>α2>α4>α1>α3.Step 3. Rank all the alternatives xiaccording to the ranking order ofαiA−IMOWA(i=1,2,3,4,5):x5≻x2≻x4≻x1≻x3. The result is the same as ours which explains the validity of our method.Thirdly, for further comparison, the method proposed by Xia et al. in [9] is adopted to deal with this issue. Since Xia et al. [9] introduced the GIMWA and GIMWG operators (“non-ordered” operators) to aggregate the intuitionistic multiplicative information in IMPRs, we consider the weights of all alternatives are equal, namelyw=(1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5,1/5)T.Step 1. Choose the GIMWA operator to aggregate allαij(i,j=1,2,3,4,5)to the alternatives xi(i=1,2,3,4,5) (also letλ=1):α1GIMWA=(0.452,0.989),α2GIMWA=(1.415,0.301),α3GIMWA=(0.520,1.494),α4GIMWA=(0.661,0.646)α5GIMWA=(1.441,0.338)Step 2. Calculate the scores ofαiGIMWA(i=1,2,3,4,5)according to Definition 2.5:s(α1GIMWA)=0.457,s(α2GIMWA)=4.695,s(α3GIMWA)=0.348,s(α4GIMWA)=1.023,s(α5GIMWA)=4.258thusα2>α5>α4>α1>α3Step 3. Rank all the alternatives xiaccording to the ranking order ofαiGIMWA(i=1,2,3,4,5)and thenx2≻x5≻x4≻x1≻x3.For better comparison, the ranking results by different methods are summarized in Table 2:Table 2 shows that both Procedure I and Xia et al. [9]’s method produce the same ranking, where the optimal alternative is x2, while Procedure II and Yu and Fang [14]’s method produce the same ranking, where the optimal alternative is x5. That is because the former two methods adopt “non-ordered” weighted operators (the IFWA, IFWG and GIMWA operators), while the latter two methods adopt “ordered” weighted operators (the GIMOWA and A-IMOWA operators). The formers assume that the aggregated arguments have the same weights, while the latter ones assign the largest and smallest arguments smaller weights, which can relieve the influence of “unfair” arguments on the decision results. For example, the largest IMNα23=(5,1/9,9/5)in the second line plays an important role in increasing the value ofα2. In the former two methods, every aggregated IMN has the same weight (w=1/5), while in the latter two methods,α23is assigned a smaller weight (w=1/10) in order to relieve its influence on the decision result, therefore, a different optimal alternative x5 is obtained.In addition, Procedure I needs to transform the IMPR into the IFPR before aggregating information, and consequently it is some more complex than other methods from the viewpoint of calculations. However it opens up a new way to solve the decision making problems with IMPRs by making full use of the existing work on IMPRs, not only the aggregation operators, but also the distance measure, the similarity measure, the consistency analysis, the consensus model and so on. In the practical applications, it should select some proper approaches according to the actual situations flexibly.In this paper, some approaches for ranking alternatives on the basis of the IMPRs have been given from different angles. The major contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:1.This paper has established a transformation mechanism including three transformation functions by which a given IMPR can be transformed to a corresponding IFPR and then all the existing work on IFPRs can be applied into dealing with IMPRs. The transformation mechanism is not only effective for deriving the ranking orders of the alternatives, but necessary for making the decision information uniform as well.This paper has developed some ordered weighted operators for aggregating intuitionistic multiplicative information, including the IMOWA, IMOWG, GIMOWA and GIMOWG operators, and discussed their properties by taking the IMOWA operator as an example.This paper has made some comparisons of the proposed methods and the previous work and analyzed their differences in details through a numerical example.In the further research, more applications of IMPRs should be worked on, for instance, decision support systems, management information systems, especially expert system, may be interesting future research directions.
