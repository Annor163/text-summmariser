Preventing male infertility by marjoram and sage essential oils through modulating testicular lipid accumulation and androgens biosynthesis disruption in a rat model of dietary obesity

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Male infertility is mostly associated with increased occurrence of obesity.Obese men have poorer outcomes after medicinal treatments.This encouraged us to examine the effect of sage and marjoram oil extracts.Both oils showed marked improving effect against male infertility.Responsible mechanism based on preventing relevant hormonal and metabolic changes.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Obesity has been recognized as a leading cause for male infertility. This study aimed to investigate reproductive disorders caused by obesity and the possible prevention through the use of marjoram and sage oil extracts. Obesity was achieved in adult male rats by feeding high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, while marjoram (0.16 ml/kg b.wt) and sage (0.05 ml/kg b.wt) oils were given orally for the same duration. HFD-fed rats exhibited marked obesity features indicated by increased adiposity index, with higher weight gain compared to control rats. This goes with increased lipid accumulation in testis and serum of the obese rats. Increased serum levels of leptin, prolactinL (PRL) and estrogen (E2), with reduced serum androgens; dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T) and T/E2 ratio were also observed. Additionally, the results showed significant reduction in epididymal sperm count, as well as in steriodogenic enzymes; 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and acid phosphatase (ACP), with marked elevation in aromatase activity in testis of the obese rats. Histopathological alterations, including degenerative changes in seminiferous tubules, with sloughing, vacuolization and reduction of spermatogenic cells were also detected. Oral administration of marjoram or sage oil extracts, along with HFD seemed to prevent overall mentioned alterations, as evident by reduced testicular lipid accumulation, elevated androgens and sperm count, in addition to improved testicular structure. Results thus suggested that both oils should be considered in future therapeutic approaches for controlling adverse impact of obesity on male fertility.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Obesity is a growing health problem that represents a major cause for number of chronic diseases. The most common, includes cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and some types of cancer [1]. Besides, a direct relation between obesity and male infertility has been postulated [2]. This relation has merited deep investigation over the past decade owing to the concurrent trends of rising obesity with increasing male infertility [3]. Researchers have found higher prevalence of oligospermia in overweight and obese men, with a significant association between sperm count and body mass index (BMI) [4]. Obese men have been shown to exhibit reduced androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels with elevated levels of circulating estradiol [5]. Obesity was also found to affect the GnRH-LH/FSH pulse that may impair Lyedig and Sertoli cell functions with subsequent effects on sperm maturation [6].In recent years, a dramatic increase has occurred in the use of natural plants for maintaining health and preventing diseases. Of these, aromatic plants are characterized by the presence of volatile compounds with pleasant odor known as essential oils (EOs). Aromatic plants are particularly cultivated for the use in food processing, flavoring and other culinary purposes. However, they were identified also for their high curative activities [7]. One of the most familiar aromatic plants is marjoram (Origanum majorana, family Lamiaceae) which is particularly native to the Mediterranean region [8]. In folk medicine, marjoram extracts are used for coughs, cramps, depression, dizziness, gastrointestinal disorders, migraine and nervous headaches [9]. Besides, marjoram has been used as analgesic, antiseptic, antiviral, bactericidal and laxative agent [10]. Marjoram or its EOs seemed also to be effective in enhancing metabolism and maintaining healthy weight [11].Sage (Salvia officinalis) is another aromatic plant belonging to family Lamiaceae. It is commonly used as a spice and condiment in food preparation, particularly in the Mediterranean cuisine [12]. Sage and its isolated oils are largely responsible for various therapeutic effects mainly indicated in the treatment of muscle pain and digestive disorders [13], as well as in promoting energy expenditure and fat oxidation, which may aid in body weight reduction [12]. Sage has shown also to possess antispasmodic, antidepressant and sedative activities [14].Although much research supporting medicinal activities of both marjoram and sage oil extracts, little is known regarding their effects on obesity and related diseases, particularly male infertility. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of administrating marjoram and sage oil extracts in reducing negative impact of obesity on male fertility. This was achieved in terms of evaluating number of reproductive indices, including lipid profile, reproductive hormones, testicular enzymes and histopathological changes in testicular tissue.This study was performed on male Wister albino rats initially weighing 170–180 g. Rats were permitted adequate standard rodent diet (purchased from Meladco fed Company, Aubor city, Cairo, Egypt) and given water ad libitum for one week of acclimation period before the experimental work. The animals care and experiments were complied with “Research Ethics Committee” Mansoura University, Egypt, in accordance with principles of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council “NRC” (NRC 1995).Marjoram (O. majorana) oil extract was obtained from the Agriculture Research Center, Cairo, Egypt, while sage (S. officinalis) oil extract was obtained from “Nature's Alchemy” distributed by Lotus Brands, USA.Dehydroepiandrosterone, NAD, glycerol and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma Company for Chemicals, Cairo, Egypt. All other reagents are of analytical grade and purchased from local suppliers.
