@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Gene selection is an important task in bioinformatics studies, because the accuracy of cancer classification generally depends upon the genes that have biological relevance to the classifying problems. In this work, randomization test (RT) is used as a gene selection method for dealing with gene expression data. In the method, a statistic derived from the statistics of the regression coefficients in a series of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) models is used to evaluate the significance of the genes. Informative genes are selected for classifying the four gene expression datasets of prostate cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the rationality of the results is validated by multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling and principal component analysis (PCA). With the selected genes, satisfactory results can be obtained.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cancer classification based on microarray has become a popular research topic in bioinformatics, which can be used to detect subtypes of cancers and produce therapies. A great many of studies have appeared for cancer classification [1–3]. These methods include principal component analysis (PCA) [4,5], k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) [6], hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) [7], support vector machine (SVM) [8], Bayesian method [9], partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) [10], ensemble methods [11], etc. Among these methods, PLSDA has been the most commonly used one for cancer classification due to its simplicity [12–14]. Moreover, as a dimension reduction technique, PLS has been used in gene expression data analysis even in the case where the number of genes exceeds the number of samples.Except for a few classification methods using full genes [15], classification is generally performed based on selecting significant genes for constructing accurate prediction models. Furthermore, gene selection may provide insights into understanding the underlying mechanism of a specific biological phenomenon. Also, such information can be useful for designing less expensive experiments by targeting only a handful of genes [16]. However, how to effectively select significant biomarker genes from thousands or even ten thousands of genes is a difficult problem. A comprehensive review of feature selection methods has been described by Saeys et al. [17]. Depending on how the genes interact with the construction of the classification model, feature selection techniques can be characterized into three classes: filter, wrapper and embedded methods. Filter methods [18] assess the relevance of features by looking only at the intrinsic properties of the data, and thus they are computationally simple and fast. Wrapper methods [19] employ a selection strategy in the space of all possible feature subsets, guided by the predictive performance of a classification model. Advantage of these methods includes the interaction between gene subset search and model selection. However, they may have a higher risk of over-fitting than filter methods and may be computationally intensive. Embedded methods [20] make use of the internal parameters in a classification model to perform feature selection, and, therefore, the computational cost is reduced but the advantage of the interaction between the gene selection and classification model is preserved. Based on the three classes of feature selection techniques, various gene selection algorithms have been proposed and successfully used in selecting informative genes for cancer classification [21–25]. In our previous works, Monte Carlo based uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE) [26], randomization test (RT) [27], PLS with the influential variables (IVs) [28] and latent projective graph (LPG) [29] have been proposed for selecting informative variables in near-infrared spectral analysis. Among these methods, RT has been proved to be an efficient approach to extract useful information from the spectra. The method builds a regular model and a series of random models, and then evaluates the importance of the variables based on the significance test of coefficients in regular and random models. The variables with high significance can be selected as the informative ones.In this study, RT coupled with PLSDA was employed to seek the significant genes for cancer classification. A set of PLSDA models are built by permutation, and the significance of genes are evaluated by a statistic. To validate the performance and applicability of the method, four gene expression datasets were investigated. The results show that the method can select significant genes for cancer classification.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Randomization test is employed as a gene selection method. The method can evaluate the significance of a gene by a statistic of the regression coefficients in a series of random PLSDA models. Therefore, a few of the significant genes can be selected from the thousands or more genes in an expression data. With repetition of the calculations, the frequency number of a gene can be further used as a criterion to evaluate its significance. Four datasets of prostate cancer dataset, lung cancer dataset, leukemia dataset and NSCLC dataset are investigated by the method. 18, 4, 9 and 7 significant genes are identified, respectively, and the rationality of the results is validated by MLR modeling and PCA. Compared with the results obtained in previous studies, the superiority of the method is proved. Therefore, the method may be an alternative tool for classification using the expression data.
