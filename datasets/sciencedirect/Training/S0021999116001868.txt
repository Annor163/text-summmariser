@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The new second-order two-scale (SOTS) finite element algorithm is developed for the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems in axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures made of composite materials. The axisymmetric structure considered is periodic in both radial and axial directions and homogeneous in circumferential direction. The spherical symmetric structure is only periodic in radial direction. The dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling model is presented and the equivalent compact form is derived. Then, the cell problems, effective material coefficients and the homogenized thermo–mechanical coupling problem are obtained successively by the second-order asymptotic expansion of the temperature increment and displacement. The homogenized material obtained is manifested with the anisotropic property in the circumferential direction. The explicit expressions of the homogenized coefficients in the plane axisymmetric and spherical symmetric cases are given and both the derivation of the analytical solutions of the cell functions and the quasi-static thermoelasticity problems are discussed. Based on the SOTS method, the corresponding finite-element procedure is presented and the unconditionally stable implicit algorithm is established. Some numerical examples are solved and the mutual interaction between the temperature and displacement field is studied under the condition of structural vibration. The computational results demonstrate that the second-order asymptotic analysis finite-element algorithm is feasible and effective in simulating and predicting the dynamic thermo–mechanical behaviors of the composite materials with small periodic configurations in axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures. This may provide a vital computational tool for analyzing composite material internal temperature distribution and structural deformation induced by the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling response under strong aerothermodynamic environment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the rapid development of aeronautic and aerospace engineering, composite materials are widely used for manufacturing aircraft wing, satellite antenna and its supporting structures, solar wing and shell, and the thermal protection system for the space vehicle etc. The composites are mostly heterogeneous with complex micro periodic structures and with the appearance of complex and extremely severe environments, composite structures usually work under the coupled thermo–mechanical circumstances of spacecraft re-entry. The practical application of composites depends on an effective method to simulate and predict the coupled thermal and mechanical performances. Generally, the equations governing the coupled heat conduction and deforming processes for the composites possess rapidly varying coefficients, and the direct numerical simulations may be realized at cost of huge computational time. While some various numerical modeling approaches [1–3] are developed to obtain the effective thermal and mechanical properties, the homogenization methods [4–9] are introduced to reduce the equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients to the equations for the materials with homogeneous properties. By the asymptotic expansion of the corresponding physical variable, temperature or displacement for example, the homogenization technique is applied to various physical problems [4,9], including the coupled heat conduction-radiation problem [10], the coupled thermoelasticity problems [11–13], the large deformation problem [14] and the elastic problem for the hollow cylinder with discontinuous coefficients [15], and then the corresponding multi-scale finite element methods have also been established [16–18]. Based on this research, Cui and Cao [19–21] developed a Second-Order Two-Scale (SOTS) method to predict physical and mechanical behaviors of composite and perforated materials by introducing the second-order correctors, while the previous homogenization researches involve only the first-order asymptotic expansions. Su and Ma [22,23] extended the SOTS method to heat conduction, linear elasticity and thermo-elastic problems for quasi-periodic structures. Wang [24] developed the SOTS method for bending behavior analysis of composite plate with 3-D periodic configuration. Yang and Zhang [25,26] studied the second-order asymptotic solutions for integrated heat transfer problems with conduction, convection and radiation in periodic composite or porous materials. Feng, Wan and Yang [27–29] obtained the multi-scale second-order solutions for the quasi-static and dynamic thermo-elastic problems. By using the statistical SOTS method, Li [30] studied the mechanical properties of materials with a random distribution of grains and Yang [31] analyzed the thermo-elastic behaviors for the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupled response of random particulate composites.Up to now, some researches have been performed on dynamic thermo–mechanical problems of periodic composites only in Cartesian coordinates. However, it is known that the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures are often used in the engineering applications such as the axisymmetric spacecraft, cylindrical pressure vessel, culvert pipe, tube of the artillery, or the high pressure sphere tank. Multilayered or periodic composite configurations are often utilized to increase the bearing capacity of the structure. To analyze and simulate the thermal and elastic behaviors of this kind of structures, we should generalize the SOTS method to the thermo–mechanical coupling problems in cylindrical and spherical coordinate system. Chatzigeorgiou [15] analyzed the homogenization for the hollow cylinder with discontinuous properties in the cylindrical coordinate system, but the first or higher order correctors of the displacement haven't been discussed. In this work, we are essentially dealing with developing the finite-element algorithm for the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems. In the earlier paper [32], the SOTS asymptotic analysis has been applied to the static elastic problem in the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structure. In this paper, the asymptotic expansion of the temperature and displacement of the dynamic thermo–mechanical system in the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures will be presented, and the corresponding finite-element procedures will be implemented on the basis of the two-scale asymptotic analysis. Then, the unconditionally stable implicit algorithm is developed to simulate the thermo–mechanical coupled system, in which the explicit expressions of the homogenized coefficients in the plane axisymmetric and spherical symmetric cases are given. Some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the present proposed algorithm and to simulate the vibration effects of the temperature increment and displacement.For this purpose, the remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. The governing equations of the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems for the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures are presented and the equivalent compact formulations are derived for the convenience of the SOTS analysis in Section 2. The SOTS expansions of the temperature increment and displacement are formally defined and the homogenized dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems, the homogenized coefficients and microscopic cell problems, are deduced and discussed in Section 3. The finite-element procedure is presented in Section 4. Some numerical examples are shown in Section 5, followed by the conclusions in Section 6. Throughout this paper, convention of summation on repeated indices is used and the letters in bold represent the matrix or vector functions or variables in the formulation. ByO(εk),k∈N, we denote that there exists a constant c independent of ε and|O(εk)|≤cεk.Consider two typical axisymmetric structures made of composite materials depicted in Fig. 1. The infinite hollow cylinder shown in Fig. 1(a) is multilayered periodically with two different materials along the radial direction, while the reinforced fibers are arranged in both radial and axial directions of the cylinder in Fig. 1(b), both of which are homogeneous in circumferential direction. Also, by considering that the thermo–mechanical performance of such structures occurs only in the radial and axial directions, we can simplify the modal analysis only in the axisymmetric plane A. For convenience of our asymptotic analysis, set the indicial notation (x1,x2,θ) as the cylinder coordinate instead of the conventional (r,z,θ). Neglecting the damping effect, the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling equations are presented by(1){ρεcε∂θε∂t−1x1∂∂xi(aεx1∂θε∂xi)+T0βε∂evε∂t=hinA×[0,t¯],ρε∂2u1ε∂t2−1x1∂∂x1(x1σ1ε)−∂σ12ε∂x2+σφεx1=f1inA×[0,t¯],ρε∂2u2ε∂t2−1x1∂∂x1(x1σ12ε)−∂σ2ε∂x2=f2inA×[0,t¯],in whichθε(x,t)=T¯ε(x,t)−T0denotes the temperature increment withT¯ε(x,t)andT0as the absolute temperature and reference temperature, respectively.uε(x,t)=[u1εu2ε]Tdenotes the displacement vector withu1εandu2εbeing the radial and axial displacement, respectively. The superscript “T” denotes the transpose operator and[0,t¯]is the time interval. Suppose the plane A is composed of entire cells with periodicity ε, i.e.,A=⋃z∈Iε(Q+z),whereQ=[0,1]2is the normalized cell domain andI={z=(z1,z2)∈Z2|ε(Q+z)∈A}is the index set. Assume the materials are homogeneous and isotropic, andρε,cε,aεandβεdenote density, specific heat, heat conductivity and thermal modulus, respectively. By the periodic configuration, we haveρε(x)=ρ(x/ε)=ρ(y),cε(x)=c(x/ε)=c(y),aε(x)=a(x/ε)=a(y),βε(x)=β(x/ε)=β(y),in whichρ(y),c(y),a(y)andβ(y)are 1-periodic functions, andy∈Q. Here, there exists the problem of “Two Scale” which represents the macroscopic scalexthat describes the macro geometry of a structure and the microscopic scaley, which characterizes the micro periodic cell domain inside the structure, and they are connected by the periodicity ε asy=εx.Define the stress vectorσεbyσε=[σ1εσ2εσφεσ12ε]T,and the strain vectoreεbyeε=[e1εe2εeφεe12ε]T=[∂u1ε∂x1∂u2ε∂x2u1εx1∂u1ε∂x2+∂u2ε∂x1]T.evεis the volume strain andevε=e1ε+e2ε+eφε.The constitutive relation of this coupled system reads asσε=Dεeε−Jβεθε,withDεbeing the constitutive matrix,Dε=[λε+2μελελε0λελε+2μελε0λελελε+2με0000με],whereλεandμεare the Lamé constants of the materials. Generally,λε,μεandβεcan be expressed by the Young's modulusEε, Possion's ratioνεand thermal expansionαεas(2)λε=Eενε(1+νε)(1−2νε),με=Eε2(1+νε),βε=Eε1−2νεαε,respectively. From the periodic configuration of the plane A, we have similarlyλε(x)=λ(x/ε)=λ(y),με(x)=μ(x/ε)=μ(y),Eε(x)=E(x/ε)=E(y),νε(x)=ν(x/ε)=ν(y),αε(x)=α(x/ε)=α(y).The functionsλ(y),μ(y),E(y),ν(y)andα(y)are also 1-periodic in Q.Jdenotes the column vectorJ=[1110]T.f=[f1f2]Tis the volume force, and h is the heat source term.For the convenience of the SOTS analysis, define the following fourth-order elastic tensorCijklε(x)=λε(x)δijδkl+2με(x)δikδjl,i,j,k,l=1,2,and the second-order stress tensor(3)σijε=Cijklε∂ukε∂xl+δijλεu1εx1−δijβεθ0,whereδijis the Kronecker delta, andσ11ε=σ1ε,σ22ε=σ2ε,σ12ε=σ21ε.Substitute Eq. (3) into Eq. (1) and then we can define the axisymmetric dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem in terms ofθε(x,t)anduε(x,t), as follows(4){ρεcεx1∂θε∂t−∂∂xi(aεx1∂θε∂xi)+T0x1βε∂2uiε∂t∂xi+T0βε∂u1ε∂t=hx1inA×[0,t¯],ρεx1∂2uiε∂t2−∂∂xj(x1Cijklε∂ukε∂xl)−∂∂xj(δijλεu1ε)+∂∂xj(x1δijβεθε)+δi1[(λε+2με)u1εx1+λε∂ukε∂xk−βεθε]=fix1inA×[0,t¯],θε(x,0)=0,uiε(x,0)=0,∂uiε∂t(x,0)=0inA,θε(x,t)=0onΓ1×[0,t¯],aε∂θε∂xini=qonΓ2×[0,t¯],uiε(x,t)=0onΓ¯1×[0,t¯],σijεnj=pionΓ¯2×[0,t¯].In this model, ∂A denotes the boundary of A that is smooth and∂A=Γ1∪Γ2=Γ¯1∪Γ¯2,Γ1∩Γ2=Γ¯1∩Γ¯2=∅.n=[n1n2]Tis the outward unit vector normal to the corresponding boundary. The heat flux q is applied onΓ2and the surface forcep=[p1p2]Tis imposed onΓ¯2. At the initial time, the system is static with no temperature increment, displacement or velocity.Furthermore, if the temperature and displacement are independent of the axial variablex2, Eq. (4) reduces to the plane axisymmetric problem. In this paper, we consider the following one-dimensional problem presented in terms of temperatureθε(x1,t)and the radial displacementu1ε(x1,t)as(5){ρεcεx1∂θε∂t−∂∂x1(x1aε∂θε∂x1)+T0x1βε∂2u1ε∂t∂x1+T0βε∂u1ε∂t=hx1in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],ρεx1∂2u1ε∂t2−∂∂x1[x1(λε+2με)∂u1ε∂x1]−∂∂x1(λεu1ε)+∂∂x1(x1βεθε)+(λε+2με)u1εx1+λε∂u1ε∂x1−βεθε=f1x1in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],θε(x1,0)=0,u1ε(x1,0)=0,∂u1ε∂t(x1,0)=0in[r0,r1],θε(r0,t)=0,aε∂θε∂x1(r1,t)=q,u1ε(r0,t)=0,σ1ε(r1,t)=−pin[0,t¯],wherer0andr1denote the inner and outer radius, respectively, and p is the pressure applied on the outer surface.If we consider a composite hollow sphere with inner radiusr0and outer radiusr1and the constituent materials are periodically distributed in only radial direction and homogeneous in other two directions, the spherical symmetric dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem is similar with the plane axisymmetric case in (5). The only attention should be paid to the fact that the volume strain becomesevε=e1ε+2eφε,and the constitutive relation now reads asσε=[σ1εσφε]=[λε+2με2λελε2(λε+με)][∂u1ε∂x1u1x1]−[βεβε]θε.Again the thermo–mechanical coupling problem in the spherical symmetric structure is presented in terms ofθε(x1,t)andu1ε(x1,t)by(6){ρεcεx12∂θε∂t−∂∂x1(x12aε∂θε∂x1)+T0x12βε∂2u1ε∂t∂x1+T02x1βε∂u1ε∂t=hx12in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],ρεx12∂2u1ε∂t2−∂∂x1[x12(λε+2με)∂u1ε∂x1]−∂∂x1(2x1λεu1ε)+∂∂x1(x12βεθε)+4(λε+με)u1ε+2x1λε∂u1ε∂x1−2x1βεθε=f1x12in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],θε(x1,0)=0,u1ε(x1,0)=0,∂u1ε∂t(x1,0)=0in[r0,r1],θε(r0,t)=0,aε∂θε∂x1(r1,t)=q,u1ε(r0,t)=0,σ1ε(r1,t)=−pin[0,t¯],In this section, we use the SOTS method to analyze the space axisymmetric problem described in Eq. (4). According to the procedure of the asymptotic analysis [4,9], firstly assume thatθε(x,t)anduε(x,t)can be formally expanded as follows.(7)θε(x,t)=θ0(x,t)+εθ1(x,y,t)+ε2θ2(x,y,t)+O(ε3),uε(x,t)=u0(x,t)+εu1(x,y,t)+ε2u2(x,y,t)+O(ε3),whereθ0(x,t)andu0(x,t)are homogenized solutions independent of the microscopic variabley.θ1(x,y,t),θ2(x,y,t),u1(x,y,t)andu2(x,y,t)are called as the first- and second-order correctors of the temperature increment and the displacement, respectively. Respecting(8)∂∂xi→∂∂xi+ε−1∂∂yi,taking Eqs. (7) and (8) into the coupling equations in Eq. (4), rewriting these two equations above as the ε power series, equating the coefficients of the same power on both sides, and taking into account of the properties ofθ0(x,t)andu0(x,t), one obtains the first two systems of equations:(9)O(ε−1):{−∂∂yi(ax1∂θ1∂yi)−∂∂yi(ax1∂θ0∂xi)=0,−∂∂yj(x1Cijkl∂uk1∂yl)−∂∂yj(x1Cijkl∂uk0∂xl)−∂∂yj(δijλεu10)+∂∂yj(δijx1βθ0)=0.(10)O(ε0):{ρcx1∂θ0∂t−∂∂yi(ax1∂θ2∂yi)−∂∂yi(ax1∂θ1∂xi)−∂∂xi(ax1∂θ1∂yi)−∂∂xi(ax1∂θ0∂xi)+T0x1β∂∂t(∂ui1∂yi+∂ui0∂xi)+T0β∂u10∂t=hx1,ρx1∂2ui0∂t2−∂∂yj(x1Cijkl∂uk2∂yl)−∂∂yj(x1Cijkl∂uk1∂xl)−∂∂xj(x1Cijkl∂uk1∂yl)−∂∂xj(x1Cijkl∂uk2∂xl)−∂∂yj(δijλu11)−∂∂xj(δijλu10)+∂∂yj(δijx1βθ1)+∂∂xj(δijx1βθ0)+δi1[(λ+2μ)u10x1+λ(∂uk1∂yk+∂uk0∂xk)−βθ0]=fix1.From Eq. (9), the first correctorsθ1(x,y,t)anduk1(x,y,t)are formally defined by(11){θ1(x,y,t)=Nα1(y)∂θ0(x,t)∂xα1,uk1(x,y,t)=Nα1km(y)∂um0(x,t)∂xα1+Mk(y)u10(x,t)x1−Hk(y)θ0(x,t),α1=1,2,whereNα1(y),Nα1km(y),Mk(y)andHk(y)are 1-periodic functions in Q, and satisfy the following four cell problems, respectively,(12){−∂∂yi(a∂Nα1∂yi)=∂a∂yα1inQ,∫QNα1dy=0,(13){−∂∂yj(Cijkl∂Nα1km∂yl)=∂Cijmα1∂yjinQ,∫QNα1kmdy=0,(14){−∂∂yj(Cijkl∂Mk∂yl)=∂λ∂yiinQ,∫QMkdy=0,(15){−∂∂yj(Cijkl∂Hk∂yl)=∂β∂yiinQ,∫QHkdy=0.According the formulations above, we have the following important relationships:(16)∫QCijmα1∂Mi∂yjdy=∫Qλ∂Nα1im∂yidy,(17)∫QCijmα1∂Hi∂yjdy=∫Qβ∂Nα1im∂yidy,(18)∫Qλ∂Hi∂yidy=∫Qβ∂Mi∂yidy.In fact, the weak forms forNα1(y),Nα1km(y),Mk(y)andHk(y)can be easily obtained from Eqs. (13), (14) and (15) as follows.(19)∫QCijkl∂Nα1km∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=−∫QCijmα1∂ϕi∂yjdy,(20)∫QCijkl∂Mk∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=−∫Qλ∂ϕi∂yidy,(21)∫QCijkl∂Hk∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=−∫Qβ∂ϕi∂yidy,whereϕiare arbitrary 1-periodic test functions. Making use of the symmetrical characteristic ofCijkl, Eq. (16) follows by takingϕi=Miin Eq. (19) andϕi=Nα1imin Eq. (20), Eq. (17) follows by takingϕi=Hiin Eq. (19) andϕi=Nα1imin Eq. (21), and Eq. (18) follows by takingϕi=Hiin Eq. (20) andϕi=Miin Eq. (21).Next, we proceed to Eq. (10). By taking into account the expressions ofθ1(x,y,t)anduk1(x,y,t)in Eq. (11), the homogenized thermo–mechanical coupling equations forθ0(x,t)andu0(x,t)are obtained on the basis of an integral average over Q as(22){(ρc)0x1∂θ0∂t−∂∂xi(a0x1∂θ0∂xi)+T0x1βij0∂2ui0∂xj∂t+T0βφ0∂u10∂t=hx1,ρ0x1∂2ui0∂t2−∂∂xj(x1Cijkl0∂uk0∂xl)−∂∂xj(λij0u10)+∂∂xj(x1βij1θ0)+δi1[(λ+2μ)1u10x1+λij1∂ui0∂xj−βφ1θ0]=fix1,where(ρc)0,ρ0,a0,βij0,βij1,βφ0,βφ1,Cijkl0,(λ+2μ)1,λij0andλij1are the so-called “homogenized” or “effective” coefficients defined by(23)(ρc)0=1|Q|∫Q(ρc−T0β∂Hk∂yk)dy,ρ0=1|Q|∫Qρdy,a0=1|Q|∫Q(a+a∂Nk∂yk)dy,βij0=1|Q|∫Q(βδij+β∂Njki∂yk)dy,βij1=1|Q|∫Q(βδij+Cijkl∂Hk∂yl)dy,βφ0=1|Q|∫Q(β+β∂Mk∂yk)dy,βφ1=1|Q|∫Q(β+λ∂Hk∂yk)dy,Cijkl0=1|Q|∫Q(Cijkl+Cijmα1∂Nlmk∂yα1)dy,(λ+2μ)1=1|Q|∫Q(λ+2μ+λ∂Mk∂yk)dy,λij0=1|Q|∫Q(δijλ+Cijkl∂Mk∂yl)dy,λij1=1|Q|∫Q(λδij+λ∂Njki∂yk)dy,respectively, where|Q|denotes the measure of the domain Q. By Eqs. (16), (17) and (18), there areβij0=βij1,λij0=λij1,βφ0=βφ1.Now the homogenized dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem can be defined as follows(24){(ρc)0x1∂θ0∂t−∂∂xi(a0x1∂θ0∂xi)+T0x1βij0∂2ui0∂t∂xj+T0βφ0∂u10∂t=hx1inA×[0,t¯],ρ0x1∂2ui0∂t2−∂∂xj(x1Cijkl0∂uk0∂xl)−∂∂xj(λ0δiju10)+∂∂xj(x1βij0θ)+δi1[(λ+2μ)1u10x1+λ0∂uk0∂xk−βφ0θ0]=fix1inA×[0,t¯],θ0(x,0)=0,ui0(x,0)=0,∂ui0∂t(x,0)=0inA,θ0(x,t)=0onΓ1×[0,t¯],a0∂θ0∂xini=qonΓ2×[0,t¯],ui0(x,0)=0onΓ¯1×[0,t¯],σij0nj=pionΓ¯2×[0,t¯],and then the homogenized constitutive relation reads asσ0=[σ10σ20σφ0σ120]=D0e0−β0θ0=[C11110C11220λ110C11120C22110C22220λ220C22120λ110λ220(λ+2μ)1λ210C12110C12220λ120C12120][∂u10∂x1∂u20∂x2u10x1∂u10∂x2+∂u20∂x1]−[β110β220βφ0β120]θ0.It can be seen that the entries ofD0in the circumferential direction φ, i.e.,(λ+2μ)1andλij0are different from the entries in the other two directions, and the homogenized thermal modulusβφ0is also not the same asβ110andβ220. For example, we can choose the cell domain Q with good symmetry such that the homogenized coefficients have the following relationships.C11110=C22220,C11220=C22110,C11120=C12110=C12220=C22120=0,λ110=λ220,λ120=λ210=0,β110=β220,β120=0.However, there are obvious distinctions betweenC11110and(λ+2μ)1and so areβ110andβφ0, which implies that homogenized material is anisotropic.To capture the local oscillating behavior of the temperature, displacement and stress fields more precisely, we need the second-order correctors. For this purpose, turning back to Eq.

In the practical engineering, the quasi-static thermo-elasticity problem is useful, and in this situation, bothθεanduεare independent of time variable t. Thus, the corresponding problem is formulated as follows.(27){−∂∂xi(aεx1∂θε∂xi)=hx1inA,−∂∂xj(x1Cijklε∂ukε∂xl)−∂∂xj(λεδiju1ε)+∂∂xj(x1βεδijθε)+δi1[(λε+2με)u1εx1+λε∂ukε∂xk−βεθε]=fix1inA,θε(x)=θ0onΓ1,aε∂θε∂xini=qonΓ2,uiε(x)=0onΓ¯1,σijεnj=pionΓ¯2.Based on Eq. (26), the corresponding SOTS expansion ofθε(x)andukε(x)are simplified as(28){θε(x)=θ0(x)+εNα1(y)∂θ0(x)∂xα1+ε2(Nα1α2(y)∂2θ0(x)∂xα1∂xα2+Mα1(y)1x1∂θ0(x)∂xα1)+O(ε3),ukε(x)=uk0(x)+ε(Nα1km(y)∂um0(x)∂xα1+Mk(y)u10(x)x1−Hk(y)θ0(x))ukε(x)=+ε2(Nα1α2km(y)∂2um0(x)∂xα1∂xα2+Mα1km(y)1x1∂um0(x)∂xα1ukε(x)=−Pk(y)u10(x)x12−Vα1k(y)∂θ0(x)∂xα1−Wk(y)θ0(x)x1)+O(ε3).From the SOTS expansion deduced in the previous section, by directly deleting the terms in the axial directionx2andy2, it is easy to obtain the SOTS expansions for the plane axisymmetric problem in Eq. (5). Here, we directly give the results without further derivation. Since the macro domain is composed of the entire cells, we set all the cell functions to satisfy the zero boundary condition so that the SOTS approximate solution can exactly satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition of the original problem. The SOTS expansions ofθε(x1,t)andu1ε(x1,t)for the problem (5) are defined by(29){θε(x1,t)=θ0(x1,t)+εN1(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂x1+ε2(N11(y1)∂2θ0(x1,t)∂x12+M1(y1)1x1∂θ0(x1,t)∂x1θε(x1,t)=−R(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂t−T0S(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂t∂x1−T0U(y1)1x1∂u10(x1,t)∂t)+O(ε3),u1ε(x1,t)=u10(x1,t)+ε(N¯1(y1)∂u10(x1,t)∂x1+M¯(y1)u10(x1,t)x1−H(y1)θ0(x1,t))u1ε(x1,t)=+ε2(N¯11(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂x12+M¯1(y1)1x1∂u10(x1,t)∂x1−P(y1)u10(x1,t)x12u1ε(x1,t)=−V(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂x1−W(y1)θ0(x1,t)x1−Z(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂t2)+O(ε3),in which the first-order cell functionsN1,N¯1,M¯and H satisfy the following problems{−ddy1(adN1dy1)=dady1in[0,1],N1(0)=N1(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dN¯1dy1]=ddy1(λ+2μ)in[0,1],N¯1(0)=N¯1(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dM¯dy1]=dλdy1in[0,1],M¯(0)=M¯(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dHdy1]=dβdy1in[0,1],H(0)=H(1)=0,and the homogenized thermo–mechanical problem forθ0(x1,t)andu10(x1,t)is described as(30){(ρc)0x1∂θ0∂t−∂∂x1(x1a0∂θ0∂x1)+T0x1β0∂2u10∂t∂x1+T0βφ0∂u10∂t=hx1in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],ρ0x1∂2u10∂t2−∂∂x1[x1(λ+2μ)0∂u10∂x1]−∂∂x1(λ0u10)+∂∂x1(x1β0θ0)+(λ+2μ)1u10x1+λ0∂u10∂x1−βφ0θ0=f1x1in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],θ0(x,0)=θ0,u10(x,0)=0,∂u10∂t(x,0)=0in[r0,r1],θ0(r0,t)=0,a0∂θ0∂x1(r1,t)=q,u10(r0,t)=0,σ10(r1,t)=−pin[0,t¯],where the homogenized coefficientsρ0,(ρc)0,a0,(λ+2μ)0,λ0,(λ+2μ)1,β0andβφ0are defined by(31)ρ0=∫01ρdy,(ρc)0=∫01(ρc−T0βdHdy1)dy,a0=∫01(a+adN¯1dy1)dy,(λ+2μ)0=∫01[λ+2μ+(λ+2μ)dN¯1dy1]dy,λ0=∫01[λ+(λ+2μ)dM¯dy1]dy=∫01(λ+λdN¯1dy1)dy,(λ+2μ)1=∫01(λ+2μ+λdM¯dy1)dy,β0=∫01(β+βdN¯1dy1)dy=∫01[β+(λ+2μ)dHdy1]dy,βφ0=∫01(β+βdM¯dy1)dy=∫01(β+λdHdy1)dy,respectively. From Eq. (30), the homogenized constitutive relation becomes(32)σ0=[σ10σφ0]=D0e0−β0θ0=[(λ+2μ)0λ0λ0(λ+2μ)1][∂u10∂x1u10x1]−[β0βφ0]θ0,which also implies that the homogenized material is anisotropic.Due to the simplicity of cell problems, the explicit expressions of the coefficients can be directly obtained by(33)(ρc)0=∫01[ρ(t)c(t)−T0β(t)(β0−β(t))λ(t)+2μ(t)]dy,a0=1/∫011a(t)dt,(λ+2μ)0=1/∫011λ(t)+2μ(t)dt,λ0=(λ+2μ)0∫01λ(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dy,(λ+2μ)1=4∫01λ(t)μ(t)+μ2(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt+(λ0)2(λ+2μ)0,β0=(λ+2μ)0∫01β(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt,βφ0=∫01β(t)λ0+2μ(t)β(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt=∫01β0λ(t)+2μ(t)β(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt.Based on the results above, for some simple cell structure, we can obtain the homogenized coefficients more specifically. For example, consider that the cell domain [0,1] is composed of two different materials with the occupation portion τ and1−τ, and the coefficients of the two materials are expressed by subscript indices such asa1,a2, etc., then we have(34)ρ0=ρ1τ+ρ2(1−τ),(ρc)0=ρ1c1τ+ρ2c2(1−τ)+τ(1−τ)T0(β1−β2)2(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ,a0=a1a2a1(1−τ)+a2τ,(λ+2μ)0=(λ1+2μ1)(λ2+2μ2)(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ,λ0=λ2(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+λ1(λ2+2μ2)τ(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ,(λ+2μ)1=(λ+2μ)0+4τ(1−τ)(λ1+μ1−λ2−μ2)(μ1−μ2)(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ,β0=β2(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+β1(λ2+2μ2)τ(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ,βφ0=β0+τ(1−τ)2(μ1−μ2)(β1−β2)(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ.From these expressions, it is interesting to compare the coefficients(λ+2μ)0with(λ+2μ)1, and alsoβ0withβφ0. Following the idea of Chatzigeorgiou [15] that the Possion's ratio plays little role in the material coefficients, then both λ and μ are positively correlated with the Young's modulus E due to the expression Eq. (2), and it is concluded that(λ+2μ)1>(λ+2μ)0. For the relationship betweenβ0andβφ0, if the heat expansion α increases with bigger E, thenβφ0>β0, otherwiseβφ0<β0. Of course, for the homogeneous material,τ=1orτ=0, and there are(λ+2μ)1=(λ+2μ)0,βφ0=β0.For a more general case in Eq. (33), we can also have(λ+2μ)1≥(λ+2μ)0, the proof can be seen in Ma et al. [32].Simultaneously the analytical solutions ofN1,N¯1,M¯and H can be obtained byN1(y1)=−y1+a0∫0y11a(t)dt,N¯1(y1)=−y1+(λ+2μ)0∫0y11λ(t)+2μ(t)dt,M¯1(y1)=∫0y1λ0−λ(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt,H(y1)=∫0y1β0−β(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt,respectively.Generally, it is difficult or even impossible to solve the homogenized dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem in Eq. (30) analytically, but the corresponding quasi-static problem can be easily obtained explicitly. For example, consider the following model:(35){−1x1∂∂x1(x1a0dθ0dx1)=0in[r0,r1],(λ+2μ)0d2u10dx12+(λ+2μ)01x1du10dx1−(λ+2μ)1u10x12=(β0−βφ0)θ0x1+β0dθ0dx1in[r0,r1],θ0(r0)=θ0,θ0(r1)=θ1,σ10(r0)=0,σ10(r1)=0,with the inner and outer temperature incrementθ0andθ1,θ0is solved byθ0=Aln⁡x1+B,A=(θ1−θ0)/ln⁡(r1/r0),B=(θ0ln⁡r1−θ1ln⁡r0)/ln⁡(r1/r0).Then, the thermoelasticity equation becomes(λ+2μ)0d2u10dx12+(λ+2μ)01x1du10dx1−(λ+2μ)1u10x12=1x1(Cln⁡x1+D),whereC=(β0−βφ0)A,D=(A+B)β0−Bβφ0.The general solution for the homogenized problem isu10(x1)=k1x1γ+k2x1−γ+Ex1ln⁡x1+Fx1,wherek1andk2are two undetermined constants, andγ=(λ+2μ)1(λ+2μ)0,E=C(λ+2μ)0−(λ+2μ)1,F=D[(λ+2μ)0−(λ+2μ)1]−2(λ+2μ)0C[(λ+2μ)0−(λ+2μ)1]2.Then the strain solutions are obtained by{ε10=k1γx1γ−1−k2γx1−γ−1+Eln⁡x1+E+F,εφ0=k1x1γ−1+k2x1−γ−1+Eln⁡x1+F,with the stress component by{σ10=k1[(λ+2μ)0γ+λ0]x1γ−1+k2[−(λ+2μ)0γ+λ0]x1−γ−1σ10=+[(λ+2μ)0+λ0](Eln⁡x1+F)+(λ+2μ)0E,σφ0=k1[(λ+2μ)1+λ0γ]x1γ−1+k2[(λ+2μ)1−λ0γ]x1−γ−1σφ0=+[(λ+2μ)1+λ0](Eln⁡x1+F)+λ0E.Combined with the boundary conditions,k1andk1are obtained as{k1=1V((λ+2μ)0γ+λ0)[r0−γ−1((λ+2μ)0+λ0)(Eln⁡r1+F)+(r0−γ−1−r1−γ−1)(λ+2μ)0Ek1=−r1−γ−1((λ+2μ)0+λ0)(Eln⁡r0+F)],k2=1V(−(λ+2μ)0γ+λ0)[r1γ−1((λ+2μ)0+λ0)(Eln⁡r0+F)−(r0γ−1−r1γ−1)(λ+2μ)0Ek2=−r0γ−1((λ+2μ)0+λ0)(Eln⁡r1+F)],whereV=r0γ−1r1−γ−1−r0−γ−1r1γ−1.Based on the expressions of the homogenized coefficients in Eq. (31), the second-order correctors can also be further simplified. It immediately follows thatM1=0and the microscopic functionsN11, R, S, U,N¯11,M¯1, P, V, W and Z satisfy the following reduced cell problems, respectively,{−ddy1(adN11dy1)=ddy1(aN1)in[0,1],N11(0)=N11(1)=0,{−ddy1(adRdy1)=ρc−T0βdHdy1−(ρc)0in[0,1],R(0)=R(1)=0,{−ddy1(adSdy1)=βdN¯1dy1+β−β0in[0,1],S(0)=S(1)=0,{−ddy1(adUdy1)=βdM¯dy1+β−β0in[0,1],U(0)=U(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dN¯11dy1]=ddy1[(λ+2μ)N¯1]in[0,1],N11(0)=N11(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dM¯1dy1]=ddy1[(λ+2μ)M¯1]+(λ+2μ)dM¯1dy1+ddy1(λN¯1)−λdN¯1dy1in[0,1],M¯1(0)=M¯1(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dPdy1]=ddy1(2μM¯1)+λdM¯dy1+(λ+2μ)−(λ+2μ)1in[0,1],P(0)=P(1)=0,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dVdy1]=ddy1[(λ+2μ)H]+ddy1(βN1)in[0,1],V(0)=V(1)=1,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dWdy1]=ddy1(λH)−λdHdy1−β+βφ0in[0,1],W(0)=W(1)=1,{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dZdy1]=ρ−ρ0in[0,1],Z(0)=Z(1)=1.It is also possible to obtain the second-order cell functions from these problems above. As an example, considering the problem forN11. By an integration iny1, there is(36)dN11dy1=−N1+C1a,in whichC1is a constant to be determined. Integrating the equation again over 0 to 1 and using the periodicity ofN11(y1), one obtainsC1=a0∫01N1(t)dt=a0[−12+a0∫01∫0t1a(s)dsdt].Integrating Eq. (36) iny1, we haveN11(y1)=−∫0y1N1(t)dt+C1∫0y11a(t)dt+C2.Taking into account the boundary condition ofN11(y1), thenC2=0. Finally, from the expression ofN1,N11(y1)=12y12−a0∫0y1∫0t1a(s)dsdt−a0[12−a0∫01∫0t1a(s)dsdt]∫0y11a(t)dt.By the same argument, the other cell problems can also be solved.From the results above in this section, all the explicit expressions of the cell functions in the SOTS expansion of Eq. (29) can be solved successively and analytically. Moreover, although it is difficult to obtain the solution of the homogenized dynamic coupled problem described in Eq. (30), the quasi-static problem in Eq. (35) can be solved easily. Compared with the classic solutions, the static temperature field is trivial, while the thermal stress is quite different because of the anisotropic property. γ is an important factor to affect the stress distribution and can be defined as the anisotropic ratio of the homogenized material. Of course for isotropic material,γ=1.Now that all the terms in the SOTS expansion for the quasi-static plane axisymmetric thermoelasticity problem can be expressed explicitly, it is convenient to apply this asymptotic model to predict the thermal and mechanical behaviors of the composite materials under some extreme environment of strong aerodynamic heating and force, and to design and optimize the composite structure in the engineering.The SOTS expansion for the spherical symmetric problem described in Eq. (6) is similar with the plane axisymmetric problem. Also, without derivation, we directly have the following SOTS expansions ofθε(x1,t)andu1ε(x1,t)as{θε(x1,t)=θ0(x1,t)+εN1(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂x1+ε2(N11(y1)∂2θ0(x1,t)∂x12θε(x1,t)=−R(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂t−T0S(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂t∂x1−T0U(y1)2x1∂u10(x1,t)∂t)+O(ε3),u1ε(x1,t)=u10(x1,t)+ε(N¯1(y1)∂u10(x1,t)∂x1+M¯(y1)2u10(x1,t)x1−H(y1)θ0(x1,t))u1ε(x1,t)=+ε2(N¯11(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂x12+M¯1(y1)2x1∂u10(x1,t)∂x1−P(y1)2u10(x1,t)x12u1ε(x1,t)=−V(y1)∂θ0(x1,t)∂x1−W(y1)2θ0(x1,t)x1−Z(y1)∂2u10(x1,t)∂t2)+O(ε3),whereN1,N¯1,M¯and H satisfy the same cell problems as the plane asymmetric case, respectively. The homogenized spherical symmetric thermo–mechanical coupling problem becomes:{(ρc)0x12∂θ0∂t−∂∂x1(x12a0∂θ0∂x1)+T0x12β0∂2u10∂t∂x1+2x1T0βφ0∂u10∂t=hx12in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],ρ0x12∂2u1ε∂t2−∂∂x1[x12(λ+2μ)0∂u10∂x1]−∂∂x1(2x1λ0u10)+∂∂x1(x12β0θ0)+4(λ+μ)0u10+2x1λ0∂u10∂x1−2x1βφ0θ0=f1x12in[r0,r1]×[0,t¯],θ0(x,0)=0,u10(x,0)=0,∂u10∂t(x,0)=0in[r0,r1],θ0(r0,t)=0,a0∂θ0∂x1(r1,t)=q,u10(r0,t)=0,σ10(r1,t)=−pin[0,t¯],where the homogenized coefficient(λ+μ)0is defined by(λ+μ)0=∫01[(λ+μ)+λdMdy1]dy=∫013λ(t)μ(t)+2μ2(t)λ(t)+2μ(t)dt+(λ0)2(λ+2μ)0,and the other coefficients are the same as the plane axisymmetric case in Eq. (33). We can also consider obtaining the explicit formula for the simple structure in [0,1] as the axisymmetric case in Eq. (34). Under this condition, there is(λ+μ)0=1(λ1+2μ1)(1−τ)+(λ2+2μ2)τ{[τ(λ1+μ1)(λ2+2μ2)+(1−τ)(λ2+μ2)(λ1+2μ1)]2+τ(1−τ)[((λ1+μ1)(λ1+2μ1)−(λ2+μ2)(λ2+2μ2))2−(λ1−λ2)2]}.The homogenized constitutive relationship becomesσ0=[σ10σφ0]=D0e0−β0θ0=[(λ+2μ)0λ02λ0(λ+μ)0][∂u10∂x1u10x1]−[β0βφ0]θ0.It is also concluded that the anisotropic material is obtained after homogenization.Analogous to the problem in Eq. (35), it is also interesting to consider the following quasi-static spherical symmetric thermo–mechanical model{−ddx1(x12a0dθ0dx1)=0in[r0,r1],(λ+2μ)0d2u10dx12+(λ+2μ)02x1du10dx1−[2(λ+μ)0−λ0]2u10x12=(β0−βφ0)2θ0x1+β0dθ0dx1in[r0,r1],θ0(r0)=θ0,θ0(r1)=θ1,σ10(r0)=0,σ10(r1)=0.The expression ofθ0is given byθ0=A¯x1+B¯,A¯=r0r1(θ0−θ1)r1−r0,B¯=r1θ1−r0θ0r1−r0.Substitutingθ0into the thermoelasticity equation, we have(λ+2μ)0d2u10dx12+(λ+2μ)02x1du10dx1−[2(λ+μ)0−λ0]2u10x12=C¯1x1+D¯1x12,withC¯=2B¯(β0−βφ0),D¯=A¯(β0−2βφ0).Then the general solution ofu10is solved byu10=k1x1γ1+k2x1γ2+E¯x1+F¯,whereγ1=−1+1+8γ¯2,γ2=−1−1+8γ¯2,γ¯=2(λ+μ)0−λ0(λ+2μ)0,E¯=C¯2[(λ+2μ)0−2(λ+μ)0+λ0],F¯=D¯2[−2(λ+μ)0+λ0],with the strains given by{ε10=k1γ1x1γ1−1+k2γ2x1γ2−1+E¯,εφ0=k1x1γ1−1+k2x1γ2−1+E¯+F¯x1,and the stresses by{σ10=k1[(λ+2μ)0γ1+2λ0]x1γ1−1+k2[(λ+2μ)0γ2+2λ0]x1γ2−1+[(λ+2μ)0+2λ0]E¯+2λ0F¯x1,σθ0=k1[2(λ+μ)0+λ0γ1]x1γ1−1+k2[2(λ+μ)0+λ0γ2]x1γ2−1+[2(λ+μ)0+λ0]E¯+2(λ+μ)0F¯x1.Taking the boundary conditions into account, the underdetermined constantsk1andk2are obtained as{k1=1V¯((λ+2μ)0γ1+2λ0)[((λ+2μ)0+2λ0)E¯(r0γ2−1−r1γ2−1)+2λ0F¯r0γ2−r1γ2r0r1],k2=1V¯((λ+2μ)0γ2+2λ0)[((λ+2μ)0+2λ0)E¯(r1γ1−1−r0γ1−1)+2λ0F¯r1γ1−r0γ1r0r1],whereV¯=r0γ1−1r1γ2−1−r0γ2−1r1γ1−1.For the second-order cell functions, only P is particularly posed, which satisfies the problem{−ddy1[(λ+2μ)dPdy1]=ddy1[(−λ+2μ)M¯]+2λdM¯dy1+2(λ+μ)−2(λ+μ)0in[0,1],P(0)=P(1)=0,while other periodic functionsN11, R, S, U,N¯11,M¯1, V, W and Z satisfy the same cell problems as the plane axisymmetric case.In this section, the Finite Element (FE) algorithm for SOTS analysis method of the space axisymmetric problem in Eq. (4) is given out. Firstly, we define the first-order two-scale (FOTS) approximation solutionsθε,1andukε,1by(37)θε,1=θ0+εNα1∂θ0∂xα1,ukε,1=uk0+ε(Nα1km∂um0∂xα1+Mku10x1−Hkθ0),and SOTS approximate solutionsθε,2andukε,2by(38)θε,2=θε,1+ε2(Nα1α2∂2θ0∂xα1∂xα2+Mα11x1∂θ0∂xα1−R∂θ0∂t−T0Sα1α2∂2uα10∂xα2∂t−T0U1x1∂u10∂t),ukε,2=ukε,1+ε2(Nα1α2km∂2um0∂xα1∂xα2+Mα1km1x1∂um0∂xα1−Pku10x12−Vα1k∂θ0∂xα1−Wkθ0x1−Zα1k∂2uα10∂t2).respectively. The main computational procedures of our proposed method are presented as follows:1.Set the material coefficientsρε,cε,λε,με(orEε,νε),βε(orαε), and the reference temperatureT0. Determine the axisymmetric domain A and the cell domain Q. Make the spatial discretization of the two domains and obtain the computation meshes.FE computation of the cell problems.2.1.Solve the first-order cell functionsNα1,Nα1km,MkandHkin Q. The weak form forNα1is given by∫Qa∂Nα1∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=−∫Qa∂ϕ∂yα1dy,in which ϕ is arbitrary 1-periodic test functions in Q, and the weak forms forNα1km,MkandHkare represented in Eqs. (19), (20) and (21), respectively.From Eq. (23), compute the homogenized coefficients(ρc)0,ρ0,a0,βij0,βφ0,Cijkl0,(λ+2μ)1andλij0.Solve the second-order cell functionsNα1α2,Mα1, R,Sα1α2, U,Nα1α2km,Mα1km,Pk,Vα1k,WkandZα1kin Q by the following weak forms, respectively,∫Qa∂Nα1α2∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=∫Q(a∂Nα1∂yα2+aδα1α2−a0δα1α2)ϕdy−∫QaNα1∂ϕ∂yα2dy,∫Qa∂Mα1∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=∫Q(a∂Nα1∂y1+aδ1α1−a0δ1α1)ϕdy,∫Qa∂R∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=∫Q(ρc−T0β∂Hk∂yk−(ρc)0)ϕdy,∫Qa∂Sα1α2∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=∫Q(β∂Nα2kα1∂yk+βδα1α2−βα1α20)ϕdy,∫Qa∂U∂yi∂ϕ∂yidy=∫Q(β∂Mk∂yk+β−β0)ϕdy,∫QCijkl∂Nα1α2km∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Q(Ciα2kl∂Nα1km∂yl+Ciα2mα1−Ciα2mα10)ϕidy−∫QCijkα2Nα1km∂ϕi∂yjdy,∫QCijkl∂Mα1km∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Qδ1m(Ciα1kl∂Mk∂yl+δiα1λ−λiα10)ϕidy−∫Qδ1mCijkα1Mk∂ϕi∂yjdy+∫Q(Ci1kl∂Nα1km∂yl+Ci1mα1−Ci1mα10)ϕidy−∫QλNα11m∂ϕi∂yjdy−∫Q(λ∂Nα1km∂yk+δmα1λ−λmα11)ϕ1dy,∫QCijkl∂Pk∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Q[λ∂Mk∂yk+(λ+2μ)−(λ+2μ)1]ϕ1dy−∫QCijk1Mk∂ϕi∂yjdy−∫QλM1∂ϕk∂ykdy,∫QCijkl∂Vα1k∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Q(Ciα1kl∂Hk∂yl+δiα1β−βiα10)ϕidy−∫QCijkα1Hk∂ϕi∂yjdy−∫QβNα1∂ϕk∂ykdy,∫QCijkl∂Wk∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Q(Ci1kl∂Hk∂yl+δi1β−βi10)ϕidy−∫Q(λ∂Hk∂yk+β−βφ0)ϕ1dy−∫QλH1∂ϕk∂ykdy,∫QCijkl∂Zα1k∂yl∂ϕi∂yjdy=∫Q(ρ−ρ0)ϕα1dy.It is observed that all the cell problems of the temperature field are elliptic and can be easily solved by the standard finite-element method with the same global stiff matrix in solving the discretized algebraic equations and so are the cell problems of the displacement field. Therefore, it will not take too much extra time for computing the second-order cell functions.3.FE computation of the homogenized problemFrom Eq. (24), the weak form forθ0andu0is formulated by(39){∫A(ρc)0T0x1∂θ0∂tθ˜0dx+∫Aa0T0x1∂θ0∂xi∂θ˜0∂xidx+∫Ax1(β0)T∂e0∂tθ˜0dx=∫AhT0x1θ˜0dx+∫Γ2qT0x1θ˜0ds,∫Aρ0x1∂2ui∂t2u˜idx+∫Ax1(e˜0)TD0e0dx−∫Ax1(e˜0)Tβ0θ0dx=∫Γ¯2x1piu˜ids,whereθ˜0andu˜i,i=1,2are arbitrary test functions in A that satisfyθ˜0=0onΓ1andu˜i=0onΓ¯1,e˜0=[e˜110e˜220e˜θ0e˜120]T=[∂u˜1∂x1∂u˜2∂x2u˜1x1∂u˜2∂x1+∂u˜1∂x2]T.The homogenized problem is strongly coupled by parabolic and hyperbolic equations, so the discretization in the spatial domain is carried out firstly, and then the time stepping scheme is used in the temporal domain [0,t¯]. According to this procedure, let the homogenized displacementu0and temperatureθ0be presented in terms of node valuesdeandξebyu0=[N(x)]2×Nvde(t),θ0=[N′(x)]1×Nvξe(t),respectively in each element, whereNvdenotes the number of nodes per element. The [N] and [N′] denote the shape functions ofu0andθ0, respectively. Moreover, the nodal strain and thermal gradient are expressed bye0=[B]2×Nede,∇θ0=[B′]1×Neξe,with [B] and [B′] denoting the gradient matrix foru0andθ0, respectively. Based on Eq. (39), the space discretized system for the dynamic thermo–mechanical problems is given by{∑e=1NeMθeξ˙e(t)+Kθeξe(t)+(Ce)Td˙e(t)=Ge(t),∑e=1NeMued¨e(t)+Kuede(t)−Ceξe(t)=Fe(t),whereNeis the number of elements, the superscripts “⋅” and “⋅⋅” denote the first- and second-order time derivatives, respectively, andMθe=∫Ae(ρc)0T0[N′]T[N′]x1dAe,Kθe=∫Aea0T0[B′]T[B′]x1dAe,Mue=∫Aeρ0[N]T[N]x1dAe,Kue=∫Ae[B]TD0[B]x1dAe,Ce=∫Ae[B]Tβ0[N′]x1dAe,Ge=∫Ae[N′]ThT0x1dAe+∫(Γ2)e[N′]TqT0x1dse,Fe=∫Ae[N]Tfx1dAe+∫(Γ¯2)e[N]Tpx1dse.By finite element assembling process, the global space discretized system is given by{Mθξ˙(t)+Kθξ(t)+CTd˙(t)=G(t),Mud¨(t)+Kud(t)−Cξ(t)=F(t).To deal with the derivative termsd¨(t),d˙(t)andξ˙(t), divide the temporal domain [0,t¯] intoNtequidistance sub-internals,0=t0<t1<⋯<tNt=t¯,with the time stepΔt=t¯/Nt,tn=nΔt,n=0,1,2,…,Nt. The unknowns at the timetnare denoted by,dn=d(tn),d˙n=d˙(tn),d¨n=d¨(tn),ξ˙n=ξ˙(tn),For the weak form of the heat problem, we use the “δ”-scheme, that is(40)Mθξn+1−ξnΔt+δKθξn+1+(1−δ)Kθξn+CTdn+1−dnΔt=δGn+1+(1−δ)Gn,where0≤δ≤1, and for the dynamic thermo elastic problem, we adopt the Newmark scheme(41)(1ηΔt2Mu+Ku)dn+1−Cξn+1=Fn+1+Mu(1ηΔt2dn+1ηΔtd˙n+(12η−1)d¨n),where the accelerationd¨n+1and velocityd˙n+1are computed by(42)d¨n+1=1ηΔt2(dn+1−dn)−1ηΔtd˙n−(12η−1)d¨n,d˙n+1=d˙n+[(1−ω)d¨n+ωd¨n+1]Δt,and the parameters0≤ω≤1,0≤η≤1/2. Usually, whenω≥0.5andη≥0.25(0.5+ω)2, the scheme (41) is unconditionally stable. Rewrite Eqs. (40) and (41) together in matrix form as(43)[Mθ+δΔtKθCT−C1ηΔt2Mu+Ku][ξn+1dn+1]=[Mθ−(1−δ)ΔtKθCT01ηΔt2Mu][ξndn]+[δΔtGn+1+(1−δ)ΔtGnFn+1+Mu(1ηΔtd˙n+(12η−1)d¨n)].At the initial step,d¨0is computed byMud¨0+Kud0−Cξ0=F0.Therefore, the computing procedure of the homogenized problem is programmed as follows:3.1.Verifyt¯,Ntand the time stepΔt=t¯/Nt. Taken=0as the initial time step, and set the parameters γ, ω and η.Assemble the matricesMu,Ku,C,MθandKθ, and form the global matrix in the computational scheme[Mθ+δΔtKθCT−C1ηΔt2Mu+Ku],[Mθ−(1−δ)ΔtKθCT01ηΔt2Mu].Assemble the initial global load vectorF0, determine the variablesd0,d˙0andξ0, and compute the initial velocityd¨0byd¨0=Mu−1(F0−Kud0+Cξ0).Assemble the vectorFn+1andGn+1and form the global load vector[δΔtGn+1+(1−δ)ΔtGnFn+1+Mu(1ηΔtd˙n+(12η−1)d¨n)].Apply the corresponding boundary conditions for the temperature increment and displacement and obtaindn+1andξn+1by Eq. (43).Compute the velocityd˙n+1and accelerationd¨n+1with the expressions in Eq. (42).Setn=n+1, ifn>Nt, finish computing, otherwise return to Step 3.3.Assembly of the FOTS and SOTS solutions of temperature, displacement, thermal gradient, strain and stress.4.1.In each time step, assemble FOTS and SOTS solutions ofθεandukεby Eqs. (37) and (38) respectively, where the term∂θ0∂tis obtained by the backward difference. From the Newmark scheme, the velocity∂u10∂tand acceleration∂2uα10∂t2is directly obtained, while∂2uα10∂xα2∂tis computed by the space derivative of the velocity∂uα10∂xα2.Compute the homogenized, FOTS and SOTS solutions of the thermal gradient,∂θ0∂xi,∂θε,1∂xiand∂θε,2∂xi, where the partial differential operation of Eq. (8) is used to compute the derivatives of the first- and second-order correctors.Compute the homogenized, FOTS and SOTS solutions of strain bye0=[e10e20eθ0e120]T=[∂u10∂x1∂u20∂x2u10x1∂u10∂x2+∂u20∂x1]T,eε,1=[e1ε,1e2ε,1eθε,1e12ε,1]T=[∂u1ε,1∂x1∂u2ε,1∂x2u1ε,1x1∂u1ε,1∂x2+∂u2ε,1∂x1]T,eε,2=[e1ε,2e2ε,2eθε,2e12ε,2]T=[∂u1ε,2∂x1∂u2ε,2∂x2u1ε,2x1∂u1ε,2∂x2+∂u2ε,2∂x1]T,and the stress approximations byσ0=D0e0−β0θ0,σε,1=Dεeε,1−Jβεθε,1,σε,2=Dεeε,2−Jβεθε,2.For the quasi-static thermo–mechanical problem (27), by deleting all the time derivative terms, the temperature incrementξand displacementdare obtained by the following two stepsKθξ=G,Kud=Cξ+F.The quasi-static thermo–mechanical problem is solved by the computable modeling on the basis of Eq. (27) as the first example. Consider a composite infinite cylinder with inner radius 1 and outer radius 2, the microscopic cell domain is shown in Fig. 2(a), where there are periodicities in both radial and axial directions. The configuration of unit square[1,2]×[0,1]in the axisymmetric plane is depicted in Fig. 2(b) withε=1/8. On the outer surfacer=2,θε=2K, and on the inner surfacer=1, setθε=0K. There is a constant heat sourceh=500J/m3throughout the materials, and no pressures are imposed on the surfaces.Since it is difficult to find the exact solutions of above problem, we have to takeθεanduεto be their FE solutions in very fine mesh for comparison. The information of computational meshes with different ε are listed in Table 1, and it is clear that the mesh partition number of SOTS approximate solutions is much less than that of fine original solutions and independent of ε. That means that the SOTS method can greatly save the memory and computational time, which is very important in engineering computation.The material coefficients are listed in Table 2and by Eq. (23) the homogenized heat conductivity is computed asa0=70.2916W/m K, and the computed homogenized elastic constitutive matrix isD0=[1.12160.54630.550000.54631.12160.550000.55000.55001.151700000.2849]×1011Pa,thus, the homogenized Possion's ratiov0and Young's modulusE0in radial and axial directions are given byv0=C11220C11110+C11220≈0.3275,E0=2C12120(1+ν0)≈7.5641×1010Pa,and the Possion's ratiovφ0and Young's modulusEφ0in circumferential direction arevφ0=λ110(λ+2μ)1+λ110≈0.3232,Eφ0=[(λ+2μ)1−λ110](1+νφ0)≈7.9617×1010Pa,respectively. It is observed that in the circumferential direction, the Possion's ratio is smaller while the Young's modulus is bigger than the ones in the other two directions, showing that the homogenized anisotropic material has the biggest strength in the circumferential direction. The computed homogenized thermal modulus vector isβ0=[2.38362.38362.36820]T×106Pa,which implies that the circumferential thermal modulus is smaller than that in other two directions. Related to the value ofEφ0andvφ0, it is also indicated that the homogenized circumferential thermal expansion is also much smaller.By the symmetry of the cylinder, we only choose the domain with one periodicity in the axial direction for our computation, that isA=[1,2]×[0,ε]shown in Fig. 2(c). The axial displacement onz=0and ε is fixed to satisfy the symmetric condition.Fig. 3shows the different approximate solutions and the present FE fine solution of the temperature increment. Due to the discontinuity of the material coefficients, there are humps in the embedded square in the temperature field, finely revealed in Fig. 3(a). The homogenized temperature increment is shown in Fig. 3(b), which is the exact solution of the following one-dimensional problem:−ddx1(a0x1dθ0dx1)=hx1,θ0(1)=0,θ0(2)=2,whereθ0is solved byθ0(x1)=−h4a0(x12−1)+8a0+3h4a0ln⁡2ln⁡x1,and the maximum of the temperature is calculated byθ0max=θ(x¯1)≈2.2564,x¯1=8a0+3h2hln⁡2≈1.7249.It is also seen from Figs. 3(c) and (d) that it is difficult for the FOTS solution to describe the exact distribution, while there is hardly any difference between the FE fine solution in Fig. 3(a) and the present SOTS solution in Fig. 3(d).The approximate solutions of thermal gradient in the radial direction is shown in Fig. 4and it is more clear that the FOTS approximation∂θε,1/∂x1in Fig. 4(c) is not sufficient to give a good result. The SOTS approximation∂θε,2/∂x1in Fig. 4(d) is more acceptable in very good agreement with the present FE fine solution ofε=1/8in Fig. 4(a). After adding the second-order correctors, the thermal gradient can be simulated accurately and effectively, and sequentially, we can obtain the thermal flux with oscillating behavior between the interface of the two materials correctly. Although extra work is done for computing the second-order correctors, it is worthwhile as the real temperature field can be reproduced precisely.By the feature of the temperature field, the corresponding thermo-elastic problem can also reduce to the plane axisymmetric problem with the one-dimensional homogenized equation as(44)C11110d2u10dx12+C111101x1du10dx1−(λ+2μ)1u10x12=(β110−βφ0)θ0x1+β110dθ0dx1.Since it is well-known that if the material is isotropic,C11110=(λ+2μ)1andβ110=βφ0, the equation above reduces to the classic plane axisymmetric thermal-stress equation. Fig. 5shows the approximate solutions of the radial displacement and it is observed that both the FOTS and SOTS asymptotic solutions can effectively give the detailed information of the displacement field.To compare the solutions quantitatively, define the following error functions forθεanduε:eθ0=θε−θ0,eθ1=θε−θε,1,eθ2=θε−θε,2,eu0=uε−u0,eu1=uε−uε,1,eu2=uε−uε,2,and the relative errors of the temperature increment and the displacement inL2andH1norms are listed with different ε in Tables 3 and 4, where the semi-norm (energy) is used in computing theH1norm. Although the present homogenized, FOTS and SOTS solutions are in accordance with the FE fine solutions, by expansion to the second order, the errors are improved significantly and the local oscillation within the micro cell of the temperature and the displacement are captured more accurately. On the other hand, as ε is decreasing, all the errors inL2norm also decrease while the errors of the homogenized solutionu10inH1norm keep almost the same. This is because the homogenized solution is incapable to describe the microscopic information so that the local fluctuation makes the errors between the homogenized and the original solution exist all the time. By adding the correctors, the errors are decreasing as ε is becoming smaller.Figs. 6 and 7show the approximate solutions of the radial and hoop stress, respectively, from which the discontinuous stress is reproduced by adding the first- and second-order correctors. From Eq. (44), it can be known that the displacement and stress are dependent on both the temperature increment and thermal gradient. Due to the inner heat source, generally, the stress inside the embedded square is bigger than that around the matrix, with the maximum lying in one embedded square, and around this square the maximum temperature increment is located.Similarly, define the following error functions for the stress componentδ10=σ1ε−σ10,δ11=σ1ε−σ1ε,1,δ12=σ1ε−σ1ε,2,δ20=σ2ε−σ20,δ21=σ2ε−σ2ε,1,δ22=σ2ε−σ2ε,2,δθ0=σθε−σθ0,δθ1=σθε−σθε,1,δθ2=σθε−σθε,2,and the computed relative errors of the stresses inL2norm are listed in Table 5, which demonstrate that there is higher accuracy in the SOTS approximations for the stress computation than in the FOTS and the homogenized solutions.From Figs. 3–7 and Tables 1, 3 and 4 in this section, it can be concluded that the SOTS approximation solution is valid to simulate the coupled thermal and mechanical behavior of the composite material in the space axisymmetric structure. The difference between the FOTS and SOTS approximate solutions may be not very significant for the displacement field, but for the temperature field, the second-order correctors are indispensable. Based on this consideration, the present SOTS finite element algorithm is always implemented in the actual engineering computation.The plane axisymmetric dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem is studied in this section. Consider the infinite multilayered cylinder with inner radius 1 and outer radius 2, but this time the cell domain is depicted in Fig. 8(a) and the cross section of the cylinder is shown in Fig. 8(b), which means that the materials are arranged periodically only in the radial direction. The non-dimensional computation is carried out and the material coefficients are listed in Table 6. The cylinder is static initially att=0, and fort>0, there is a constant heat sourceh=10applied in the cylinder. The temperature increment is set as zero on both the inner and outer surface. The inner surface is fixed while the outer surface is set free. Based on the scheme in Eq. (43), we perform the finite element computation for the homogenization solution on [0,1] by 64 elements and 65 nodes, with the mesh size 0.015625. Set the time stepΔt=0.005, the parameters of the time integrationδ=0.5,ω=0.5,η=0.25, andt¯=10. All the cell functions are obtained analytically.From Table 6, the homogenized coefficients are easily obtained by the explicit expressions in Eq. (34) withτ=0.5, therefore,(45)a0≈1.1812,(λ+2μ)0≈1.2746,λ0≈0.4856,(λ+2μ)1≈5.7930,β0≈0.4788,βφ0≈0.3586,ρ0=6.0,(ρc)0≈23.3156.The homogenized Possion's ratioν0and the Young's modulusE0in the radial direction are given byν0=λ0(λ+2μ)0+λ0≈0.2759,E0=[(λ+2μ)0−λ0](1+ν0)≈1.0067,whileνφ0andEφ0in the circumferential direction areνφ0=λ0(λ+2μ)1+λ0≈0.0773,Eφ0=[(λ+2μ)1−λ0](1+νφ0)≈5.7197,respectively. It is seen that there are much smaller Possion's ratio and bigger Young's modulus in the circumferential direction, which is consistent with the case in Section 5.1. Set the reference temperatureT0=50, and we can define the following thermo–mechanical coupling ratios in the radial and circumferential directions, respectively, asrc0=(β0)2T0(λ+2μ)0(ρc)0,rcφ=(βφ0)2T0(λ+2μ)1(ρc)0.Since(λ+2μ)1>(λ+2μ)0andβφ0<β0, in the sequential, onlyrc0is considered. From Carter [33], the thermal and elastic process has become significant for the material withrc0=0.5, andrc0=0corresponds to the uncoupled thermo-elastic behavior, and in this case,rc0≈0.3856from Eq. (45) andT0.Figs. 9 and 10show the evolutions of the approximate solutions of the temperature increment and radial displacement at various time withε=1/8in different line types. By a fine mesh with elements 1024 and mesh size 9.765625E−4, the FE solutions are also obtained for comparison and represented by circle symbols. Due to the continuous heat source from the beginning to the timet=1, the temperature rises throughout, forms the parabolic curve in the radial direction with the maximum lying aroundr=1.5and causes a transient acceleration for the displacement field, which leads to the two-way movement along the radial direction from the centerr=1.5to the inner and outer surface (in Fig. 10(a)), respectively. As the time goes on, the temperature keeps on rising (in Figs. 9(b)–(d)). Since the outer surface is in unconstraint, the cylinder is expanding and all of the radial displacements become positive (in Figs. 10(b)–(d)). When the displacements around the inner surface are also going to become positive, the reflection of the elastic wave occurs due to the fixed inner surface and the inertia effect at aboutt=7.0, which can be clearly observed in Figs. 10(e)–(f). The fluctuation of the displacement field simultaneously causes the vibration of the temperature field. In Fig. 9(g), it can be seen that at aboutt=9.0, the maximum of the temperature falls a little. Then, both of the temperature and radial displacement keep on rising, and the displacements in Figs. 10(f)–(h) are becoming positive again throughout. It can be predicted that att>10.0there are continuous oscillation and mutual influences in both of the two physical fields.It is also seen that the macroscopic behaviors are well captured at each time step by the homogenized solutions. Based on these results, the FOTS and SOTS solutions give good approximations. The SOTS solutions almost coincide with the FE solutions in fine mesh, while there are minor errors by the FOTS solutions, which can be observed in the detailed graphs of the locality in each of the figures. All the results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the SOTS method to predict the dynamic thermo–mechanical behaviors of periodic composite materials in the plane axisymmetric structure.Fig. 11shows the approximate solutions of the temperature att=5.0withε=1/2k,k=2,3,4,5. The errors of the FOTS approximations in Fig. 11(a) are observed more clearly inε=1/4, while the SOTS solutions are still almost the same as the FE solutions in fine mesh. For the approximate solutions of the radial displacement shown in Fig. 12, both the FOTS and SOTS solutions can not give the correct values onr=2since they do not rigorously satisfy the Neumann boundary condition, but as ε becomes smaller, the errors are decreasing. On the other hand, there are no errors onr=1, since all of the asymptotic solutions satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition by setting the zero boundary condition for all the cell functions. The detailed graph of the locality is also illustrated in the figures, from which it is seen that sometimes the FOTS approximate solutions may be closer to the original solution, but their derivatives are not approximated correctly and this brings in the errors in computing the heat flux and the stresses.The computed relative errors of the temperature increment and radial displacement withε=1/8and 1/16 inL2andH1norms at different time are illustrated in Fig. 13in different line types. For the homogenized solutions, the errors are bigger than the other two approximate solutions, and as ε becomes smaller, only the errors inL2norm become smaller (see Figs. 13(a)–(b) and Figs. 13(e)–(f)) while there is not much improvement of the errors inH1norm. By comparing Fig. 13(c) with 13(d) and 13(g) with 13(h), the local varying of the thermal gradient and the stress of the coupled system can not be simulated only by the homogenized solutions. The errors reduce significantly both inL2andH1norms by adding the first- and second-order correctors and as the periodicity increases, the difference between these two approximations are becoming smaller. Another notation is that the evolution of the errors with time is becoming more stable with decreasing ε.At a particular timet=5, the computed relative errors of the temperature increment and the radial displacement in bothL2andH1norms are listed in Tables 7 and 8, and the converging curves are plotted in Fig. 14with decreasing ε. Note that at this special time, the precisions ofu1ε,1are better with smaller errors than those ofu1ε,2inL2norm, as seen in Table 8, while the errors ofu1ε,1inH1norm, which are more important in the engineering, are still too large. Therefore, the second-order correctors are necessary to obtain the correct strain and stress distributions. On the other hand, by observing the numbers in the two tables and the curves in Fig. 14, it can be indicated that in theL2norm, the converging order of the relative errors for the homogenized solutions isO(ε)andO(ε2)for both FOTS and SOTS approximations, respectively. However, inH1norm, the converging order isO(1)for the homogenized solutions as they keep almost unchanged, andO(ε)for the FOTS approximations. For the SOTS approximate solutions inH1norm, the converging order may beO(ε)or higher.Error estimation of the asymptotic analysis is of fundamental importance, as only if the error estimation is given, the approximate solution can be justified mathematically. However, it involves too much and quite a lot of work needs to be done for the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problem discussed in this paper. Tedious theoretical manipulations need to be taken, and the computed relative errors shown in Figs. 13, 15and Tables 7, 8 may help obtain some inspirations.Fig. 15 shows the approximate solutions of the radial and hoop stress withε=1/16att=1.0, 3.0, 7.0 and 9.0, from which the discontinuity of the stresses on the interface of the two materials is clearly observed. As is predicted in comparing the relative errors of radial displacement in Fig. 12 and Table 8, the FOTS approximate solution can not give the correct results, and the biggest errors lie around the two boundaries, due to the errors of the radial displacement inH1norm. By adding the second-order correctors, the satisfactory stress distributions are obtained at almost every point of the domain.Finally, let us discuss the oscillating behavior of the system in different coupling ratiorc0. SetT0=25,50,100and we haverc0=0.1941,0.3856,0.7609, respectively. Fig. 16shows the time history of the temperature increment and displacement atr=1.5withε=1/8. It is found that the curves converge faster and the whole system approaches to the steady state earlier with biggerrc0. Actually, the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling of the structure is a two-way energy transformation process. The heat is transferred by conduction, part of which is converted into the elastic energy and causes the oscillation of the displacement if inertia force is considered. Conversely, part of the elastic energy is converted into heat and further transferred by conduction. With this continuously transferring process, the final steady state is reached with the energy balance between inside and outside of the system. In the example herein, the heat generated by the heat source is partly used to increase the temperature of the body and partly produces the mechanical oscillating. On the other hand, the straining of the structure produces extra heat which takes participate in the heat conducting process, causes the dissipation of the elastic energy and simultaneously suppresses the heat transferring. This bidirectional energy transformation leads to the lag effect of both the temperature and displacement field. Asrc0increases, the coupling effect is more remarkable and the system reaches static more quickly. Conversely, with smallerrc0, the oscillating of the displacement will be kept for a longer time. In the extreme condition, ifrc0=0, which implies the energy transformation only occurs from heat to elasticity and without the damping effect, the thermal-induced oscillating will always exist and never dissipate.In this work, the governing equations of the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems for the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures are presented. The SOTS expansions of the temperature increment and displacement are formally defined and the homogenized coefficients and microscopic cell problems are deduced and discussed. Then, the second-order finite element solutions of the temperature increment and displacement for the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems in the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structures are presented on the basis of the two-scale asymptotic analysis. Because of the existence of the extra terms in the circumferential direction in the coupled model, more cell functions and homogenized coefficients are obtained in comparison with the conventional coupling system in Cartesian coordinate [29]. Generally, it is indicated that the circumferential strength of the axisymmetric and spherical symmetric structure is enhanced with the bigger Young's modulus, smaller Possion's ratio, and smaller thermal expansion by the homogenization results. In the second part of this paper, we use the SOTS finite element algorithm to study the axisymmetric quasi-static and dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems where the results of the present SOTS finite-element algorithm match the FE fine solutions with hardly any difference and the accuracy and effectiveness of the present algorithm is verified.It has been indicated from the present study that the computational meshes in the cell domain and the homogeneous domain are much coarser than the original periodic fine mesh. With the same heat and elastic stiff matrices in the left hand side in the algebraic equation for solving the cell problems, the cell functions are obtained very fast. The homogenized solutions are also obtained quite quickly because of the homogenized coefficients, which make the iteration matrices well-conditioned by the comparison with the original matrices with rapid oscillating coefficients. Since the cell functions and the homogenized solutions are all independent of the periodicity ε, by the present SOTS asymptotic expansion in Eq. (26), the original thermo–mechanical coupling problem with arbitrary ε can be reproduced, which is much convenient for simulating and predicting the thermal and mechanical behaviors of the composite materials.On the other hand, the computation scheme proposed in this paper gives out good performance to simulate the vibrations of the temperature increment and displacement in a long time. With the synchronization between the SOTS asymptotic analysis and the FE solution in the fine mesh, the very detailed information in the thermo–mechanical system can be captured well. It is also indicated that only by adding the second-order correctors, the stress distributions can be accurately obtained. The ratiorc0is an important factor to evaluate the coupling effect of the two physical fields. With increasingrc0, the lag effects for the temperature and displacement field become more significant.As this work is only the beginning of the computable modeling of the dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling problems, in the future, the present method will be further developed and applied to the simulations of the spacecraft dynamic thermo–mechanical coupling response, structural deformation and failure under reentry aerothermodynamic environment.
