@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Electrocardiography is considered as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating the condition of heart's health. QRS complex, which is produced by depolarization of the heart ventricles, is the main graphical deflection seen on a typical electrocardiogram tracing. Detection of the QRS complexes is the first step toward analyzing the electrocardiogram signal. In this regard, many different algorithms have been proposed so far. In the present work an algorithm based on entropy measure is proposed which uses the calculation of the time dependent entropy for QRS complex detection. The algorithm is implemented in a way that entropy of the electrocardiogram can be calculated in different temporal resolution to improve the accurate detection rate of different QRS morphologies. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia and CSE databases are selected to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The precision and sensitivity of the proposed method for MIT-BIH database are 99.85% and 99.75%, respectively. Also the detection rate of 99.82% is achieved for CSE database. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is fast enough to be applied in real-time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common diagnostic tool for evaluating the heart's health condition and contains valuable information about the performance of the heart. A typical ECG tracing of the cardiac cycle consists of recurrent wave sequence of P, QRS and T-wave. The QRS complex, which is produced as a result of the depolarization of the heart ventricles, is the main graphical deflection seen on a typical ECG tracing. Regularly, the detection of QRS complex is the first and easiest task for the majority of heart checkups. The typical checkups consist of ECG beat segmentation [1], R–R interval estimation for heart rate variability analysis [2] and ECG classification [3].There have been several algorithms proposed for QRS complex detection. Pan and Tompkins suggested an algorithm (PT algorithm) [4], which consists of passing of ECG signal through a band-pass filter, differentiator and squaring blocks, for QRS complex detection. A Hilbert transform-based method, as an improved first-derivative based QRS detection method, was proposed by Benitez et al. [5] in which a variable threshold was determined without user intervention. Hilbert transform is an odd filter, therefore the zero-crossing of the differentiated ECG, which correspond to the R peaks, can be used for QRS complex detection [5]. A fractional digital differentiation-based algorithm (FDD) for R peak detection was proposed by Ferdi et al. [6]. In this method an FIR band-pass filter with coefficients that are only dependent on fractional order, reduces unrelated components in the ECG and produces peaks corresponding to the QRS complexes. Algorithms based on first order differentiated ECG are computationally efficient and have been exploited extensively in real-time QRS complex detection [7]. Arzeno et al. [8] compared the traditional first-derivative based algorithms for QRS detection and modified some of them with improved detection criteria. For example, in Hamilton–Tompkins algorithm [7] an automatic threshold adjustment has been performed to overcome the difficulty of manual threshold selection [8] (for comparison purposes this algorithm is called Modified HT algorithm). In another work, a method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed for QRS complex detection [9]. EMD algorithm is established on the assumption that time series are composed of some oscillatory modes, which are called intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The essential information for each frequency range would be contained in one IMF therefore the band-limited event such as QRS complex would be represented by only some successive IMFs. This fact can be used for the detection of QRS complexes. Wavelet transform has gained special attention in the QRS complex detection [10–13]. The wavelet transform provides multiresolution representation of the ECG signal where QRS complex with different energy (frequency) content can be distinguished from other ECG waves. However, the main drawback of this method is its sensitivity to the selection of wavelet basis function that affects the energy distribution among wavelet coefficients and hence the event detection efficiency. Also, there are methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have been used for QRS complex detection [14,15], which their training steps considerably need a-priori information about ECG signal. A non-linear energy transformation followed by a decision making rule was proposed by Gritzali [16] for QRS detection. In another work, time recursive prediction technique was used in single-lead and multi-lead ECG signals for QRS complex detection [17]. There are references that have used multi-channel ECG recordings for QRS complex detection. Among which K-means clustering algorithm [18] and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) [19] can be noted.As the QRS complexes in ECG tracing change the entropy of the time series, methods that measure information content can be used for QRS complex detection. Entropy represents the average amount of information contained in random variables. By providing that definition, entropy criterion to enhance the QRS complexes in 12-lead ECG signal has been applied [20,21]. In another work, S-Transform has been used to access the frequency content of the QRS complexes and the Shannon entropy has been used to highlight QRS complexes [22]. Also, an algorithm based on Shannon energy envelope has been introduced to find out the R-peaks in the ECG signal [23].In this paper an intuitive entropy-based method is proposed for QRS complex detection, which relies on the fact that QRS complexes can increase entropy significantly. Proposed entropy-based algorithm is able to describe the original ECG signal with different temporal resolution and hence highlights QRS complexes with different morphologies. Different QRS morphologies appear in the ECG recording specially when there are some abnormalities in the heart condition and these abnormal heart beat morphologies reduce the sensitivity and accuracy of common available algorithms [8]. The proposed method in this paper, seek to overcome such challenges. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm allows the real time application of the algorithm. The results of implementation of the proposed method confirm that its efficiency is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods in QRS detection and in some aspects such as computational complexity and real-time feasibility, its performance is better comparing to the traditional methods.
