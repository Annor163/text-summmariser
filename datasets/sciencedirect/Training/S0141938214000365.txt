This study investigates impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layer with a radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated thin-film transistors (TFTs). Results indicate that as the film was deposited with a higher oxygen flow, the transfer curves are positively shifted while the field-effect mobility (μFE) is significantly decreased. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (RCH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (RSD) of the fabricated devices are extracted using the total resistance method. The extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (rch) and RSD are found to increase while the extracted effective mobility (μE) is decreased with increasing oxygen flow during sputtering. These observations are postulated to be related the decrease in the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio and the increase in the Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the a-IGZO films with increasing the oxygen flow rate which lead to higher resistivity and lower carrier concentration. The extracted RSD can be comparable with RCH for the devices prepared with high oxygen flow, resulting in the roll-off of μFE as the channel length is shorter than 20μm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs) are promising for channel materials of thin-film transistors [1] (TFTs) and are feasible for driving TFTs in organic light-emitting diode displays due to large carrier mobility (>10cm2V−1s−1| and low process temperatures. Amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layers are usually deposited by sputters because of the low deposition temperature and thus the feasibility for manufacturing of devices on flexible substrates. It is well known that the properties of amorphous metal oxide semiconductor materials are strongly dependent on the processing conditions [2,3]. In this regard, there had been several reports exploring the effects of deposition power [2], oxygen flow [2,3] and working pressure [3,4], on the basic electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Both direct current (d.c.) [5,6] and radio frequency (r.f.) sputters [3,7,8] have been adopted to deposit a-IGZO films and used as the channel in the fabrication of a-IGZO TFTs. In essence, to optimize the quality of a-IGZO film is important to achieve excellent device characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Recently, Kwon et al. [9] reported that the proposed oxygen incorporation calculation method and elucidates quantitative calculation of oxygen incorporation in sputtered IGZO films and the impact on a-IGZO transistor properties, the resistivity curve with O2/IGZO incorporation ratio can be used for the tool to estimate the IGZO sputtering conditions for optimum TFT performance was confirmed. Shimura et al. [10] reported that the TFT performance varies with the source/drain materials since the source-to-drain current was found to be dependent on the contact resistance between the a-IGZO channel and source/drain (S/D) metals. In addition, the passivation layer which directly contact with the channel film region, such as hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx), would highly reduce the channel resistivity by enhancing carrier concentration and forming nearly ohmic contacts to reduce the parasitic source to drain resistance [11]. Furthermore, argon (Ar) plasma treatment at source and drain metal contact regions in a-IGZO channel film also improve the contact resistance [12]. As a common understanding, the a-IGZO TFT is in general sensitive to the oxygen vacancy, however there is fewer reports demonstrating effects of a-IGZO channel resistance and S/D contact resistance with the channels deposited at various oxygen flows on electrical characteristics of a-IGZO devices.This paper reports the impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of a-IGZO channel layer with an r.f. magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated TFTs with various channel lengths. Optimum electrical properties were indicated as the film was deposited with a lower oxygen flow from transfer and output characteristics. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (RCH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (RSD) of the fabricated devices with various oxygen flows are extracted using the total resistance method [10,11]. Finally, the relationship between the metallic atomic ratio in a-IGZO films by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) compositional analyses and the extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (rch), the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (RSD), and effective mobility (μE) were explained.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Effects of various oxygen flows on the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs prepared by r.f. magnetron sputtering are explored in this work. With an increased oxygen flow rate, the transfer curves are positively shifted while μFE and on current (at a fixed gate overdrive) decrease owing to a reduction in the estimated carrier concentration of the channel. The estimated carrier concentration increased with decreasing oxygen flow tends to enhance μFE, and on-current, while reduced Vth of a-IGZO devices. This is confirmed by the results of the resistance measurements that rch is higher while μEis lower in the films prepared with a higher oxygen flow. These outcomes are postulated to be related the decrease of the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio and the increase of Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the deposited a-IGZO films with increasing oxygen flow rate. Meanwhile, RSD obviously increases from 3.4kΩ to 14kΩ when the oxygen flow rate increases from 1 to 5sccm, however RSD would not depend on the carrier concentration in the channel because it is not changed by a different gate overdrive voltage.
