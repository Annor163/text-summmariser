@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we investigate the deviation of the priority weights from hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) in group decision-making environments. As basic elements of HMPRs, hesitant multiplicative elements (HMEs) usually have different numbers of possible values. To correctly compute or compare HMEs, there are two principles to normalize them, i.e., the α-normalization and the β-normalization. Based on the α-normalization, we develop a new goal programming model to derive the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision-making environments. Based on the β-normalization, a consistent HMPR and an acceptably consistent HMPR are defined, and their desired properties are studied. A convex combination method is then developed to obtain interval weights from an acceptably consistent HMPR. This approach is further extended to group decision-making situations in which the experts evaluate their preferences as several HMPRs. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
When people make a decision, they are often hesitant and irresolute for one reason or another, which makes it difficult to reach a final decision. The difficulty of establishing a common membership degree is not because we have a margin of error (as in an intuitionistic fuzzy set [1] or interval-valued fuzzy set [44]) or some possibility distribution (as in a type-2 fuzzy set [6]) regarding the possible values, but it is because we have a set of possible values [22]. For the sake of a better description of this situation, Torra [22] proposed the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), which permit the membership degree of an element to be presented as several possible values between 0 and 1. The HFS is not only an extension of fuzzy sets [43] that address uncertainty, but it is also a tool that can represent situations in which several membership functions for a fuzzy set are possible. Because of its suitability to address hesitant situations wherein people hesitate to make a decision from among several values, the HFS has attracted significant interest in different areas, mainly in decision making [17,18,41,42,45,46,48,49].Decision making is one of the most common activities in the real world. During the process of decision making, an expert (or a decision maker) is usually asked to give his/her preferences by comparing the relationship of each pair of the considered objects (or alternatives). Preference relations, also known as pairwise comparison matrices or judgment matrices, are efficient and popular tools used to express decision makers’ preference information regarding alternatives or criteria. In the past few decades, a number of studies have focused on the use of preference relations, and accordingly, various types of preference relations have been developed, including multiplicative preference relation [20], interval multiplicative preference relation [21], triangular fuzzy multiplicative preference relation [24], fuzzy preference relation [15], interval fuzzy preference relation [35], triangular fuzzy preference relation [33], linguistic preference relation [8,9], intuitionistic preference relation [36], intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation [31], etc. Two important research topics with respect to preference relations involve verifying their consistency and generating weights from them. Many of the consistency methods and the priority methods have been developed for various types of preference relations [3,5,7,10,13,16,25–27,30,34,37].However, the aforementioned preference relations do not consider the hesitancy information, which allows the decision makers to provide all of the possible values when comparing two alternatives (or criteria), a common situation that arises in daily life [29]. In the practical decision-making process, sometimes, because of time pressure and the lack of knowledge or data or because the decision makers (DMs) have limited attention and information processing capacities, the DMs cannot attribute to their preferences a single exact value, margin of error or distribution possibility of values, but rather, they must cope with several possible values. For example, to obtain a more reasonable decision result, a decision-making organization, which contains many experts, is asked to provide the preference information regarding a set of alternatives. Suppose the experts prefer to use the values between 0 and 1 to express their preference degrees for which the alternative xiis superior to xj. Some experts in the decision-making organization use 0.4, some use 0.5, and others use 0.6, and these three parts cannot persuade each other to change their opinions. For such cases, given that the decision-making organization is not very certain about a value, and there is hesitancy between three possible values for the degrees to which the alternative xiis superior to xj, we must consider the decision-making organization as a whole as it provides all of the possible preference values regarding a set of alternatives. In such cases, the hesitant fuzzy element {0.4, 0.5, 0.6} can describe the above situation more objectively than can the number 0.4 (or 0.5, or 0.6), the interval-valued fuzzy number [0.4, 0.6], or the intuitionistic fuzzy number (0.4, 0.4) because the degrees to which the alternative xiis superior to xjare not the convex of 0.4 and 0.6 or the interval between 0.4 and 0.6, but are just three possible values, that is, 0.4, 0.5, and, 0.6. A hesitant fuzzy preference relation is constructed when all of the preferences over a set of alternatives are provided by using hesitant fuzzy elements. Zhu and Xu [47] proposed a regression method to transform hesitant fuzzy preference relations (HFPRs) into fuzzy preference relations. Moreover, Zhu et al. [50] explored the ranking methods with HFPRs in group decision-making environments. Liao et al. [12] investigated the multiplicative consistency of HFPRs and its application in group decision making.It is noted that the HFS and the HFPR are developed based on the 0.1–0.9 scale, which is uniformly and symmetrically distributed around 0.5. In many real problems, however, the grades of the preference are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed around some value. The law of diminishing marginal utility in economics is a good example. When receiving the investments of the same resources, a company with bad performance enhances more quickly than a company with good performance; namely, the distance between the grades expressing bad information should be less than the distance between the grades expressing good information [31]. Saaty's 1–9 scale [20] is a useful tool to address such a situation, especially in expressing the multiplicative preference relation that has been applied in many areas [29]. Xia and Xu [29] used the asymmetrical 1–9 scale to express the preferences regarding two alternatives rather than the symmetrical 0.1–0.9 scale in the HFPR and then introduced a new concept of the hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR), thereby reflecting people's intuition more objectively. Referencing the above example, assume that the experts in the decision organization do not like to use the values between 0 and 1 but would prefer to use Saaty's ratio scale to provide the degree to which the alternative xiis superior to xj(i≠j). Some experts in the decision-making organization provide 1/2, some provide 1, and others provide 3. These experts cannot reach a consensus. In such cases, according to Xia and Xu [29], the degrees to which the alternative xiis superior to xj(i≠j) can be considered as a hesitant multiplicative element (HME)12,1,3, which is the basic unit of the hesitant multiplicative set (HMS) [29]. When all of the preferences over a set of alternatives are provided by using the 1–9 scale and are represented as hesitant multiplicative elements (HMEs), a hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) can be constructed. The HMPR is useful tool in dealing with the situations in which a group of decision makers (DMs) are hesitant about several possible multiplicative values for the preference degrees over paired comparisons of alternatives. Consider that the investigation of the consistency and the derivation of the priority weights play two important roles in decision making with preference relations. In this case, deriving the priority weights from hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) is an interesting and important research topic. To date, however, no investigation has been devoted to this issue. Accordingly, this paper focuses on approaches to obtaining priority weights from HMPRs.In GDM with HMPRs, the decision makers can provide all possible preferences represented by HMEs such that HMEs often have different numbers of elements. To define the consistency of HMPRs and obtain the priority methods from HMPRs, it is necessary for us to develop a normalization process that forces HMEs to have the same number of elements. In general, there are two opposite principles for the normalization: (1) the α-normalization, which reduces a HMPR to a multiplicative preference relation by removing some preference values of some elements of the HMPR; (2) the β-normalization, which adds preference values to elements that have less length than the other elements until all of the elements of the HMPR are of the same length. To select the optimal preference from all possible preferences, we should use the α-normalization. However, if we want to consider all possible preferences provided by the decision makers, we should use the β-normalization. In this paper, based on the two normalization principles, we develop different methods to derive the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision-making environments. Concretely, based on the α-normalization, we establish a goal programming model for deriving the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision making. By solving this new model, we directly obtain the priorities of the alternatives and also obtain a reduced multiplicative preference relation consisting of all optimal preferences. Then, on the basis of the β-normalization, we propose a convex combination method to obtain interval priority weights from a HMPR. Moreover, this method is extended to obtain the collective interval priority weight vector of several HMPRs in group decision-making situations.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some of the basic concepts associated with multiplicative preference relations, HFSs, HMSs, and HMPRs. In Section 3, based on the α-normalization principle, we establish a hesitant goal programming model for deriving the priority weights from HMPRs in GDM environments. Based on the β-normalization principle, Section 4 proposes a convex combination method to obtain the interval weights from HMPRs in GDM environments. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.In this section, we review some basic concepts of multiplicative preference relations, hesitant fuzzy sets, hesitant multiplicative sets, and hesitant multiplicative preference relations.Definition 2.1[19,20]Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of alternatives.A=(aij)n×nis a multiplicative preference relation of X×X, if the elements of A satisfy(1)aij=1aji,aii=1,aij∈(0,+∞),∀i,j=1,2,…,nwhere aijrepresents a multiplicative preference degree of alternative xiover xj.Hereafter, it is assumed that aijis measured by using the 1–9 ratio scale [19,20], i.e.,aij∈[1/9,9], ∀i, j=1, 2, …, n.Specifically, aij=1 indicates indifference between xiand xj; aij>1 indicates xiis preferred to xj. The larger the aij, the greater the preference degree of the alternative xiover xj. aij=9 indicates that xiis absolutely preferred to xj; aij<1 indicates xjis preferred to xi; the smaller the aij, the greater the preference degree of the alternative xjover xi. aij=1/9 indicates that xjis absolutely preferred to xi.LetA=(aij)n×nbe a multiplicative preference relation.A=(aij)n×nis a consistent multiplicative preference relation if it satisfies the following transitivity property:(2)aij=aikakj,∀i,j,k=1,2,…,nIt has been found that a perfectly consistent multiplicative preference relation can be precisely characterized by a priority vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, which satisfies∑i=1nwi=1andwi>0for i=1, 2, …, n. That is,(3)aij=wiwj,i,j=1,2,…,nIn the case that a multiplicative preference relation is not perfectly consistent, there exists no priority vector that can make Eq. (3) hold precisely.When A is inconsistent, Saaty [19,20] has proposed a CI and a CR to measure the level of inconsistency. That is,(4)CI=λmax−nn−1,CR=CIRIwhere λmax and n are the largest eigenvalue and the order of A, respectively. RI is a random index, which is the average CI of a large number of randomly generated multiplicative preference relations, and it is dependent on the orders of the multiplicative preference relations given in Table 1. If a multiplicative preference relation A satisfies CR<0.10, then A is considered acceptably consistent, while when CR≥0.10, A is considered unacceptably consistent and should be adjusted such that it is acceptably consistent to ensure the rationality of decisions [40].Let zk>0,vk>0, k=1, 2, …, m, and∑k=1mvk=1. Then,(5)∏k=1mzkvk≤∑k=1mvkzkwith equality if and only if z1=z2=⋯=zm.Letλmaxkbe the greatest eigenvalue of the multiplicative preference relationAk=(aijk)n×n, k=1, 2, …, m. SupposeT=(tij)n×n=∏k=1maij(k)vkn×nwhere∑k=1mvk=1,vk≥0, k=1, 2, …, m, andλmaxTis the greatest eigenvalue of T. Then,(6)λmaxT≤maxλmax1,λmax2,…,λmaxmTorra [22] initially introduced the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets to address situations in which several numerical values are possible for the definition of the membership degree of an element to a given set.Definition 2.3[22]Let X be a reference set. A hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is expressed as a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0,1], which can be represented by the following:(7)E=x,hE(x)|x∈Xwhere hE(x) is a set of some values in [0,1], which denote the possible membership degrees of the element x∈X to the set E. For convenience, Xia and Xu [28] called h=hE(x) a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE). Let lhdenote the number of all elements in the HFE h.It is noted that the HFS uses the symmetrical 0.1–0.9 scale to express the membership degrees, which is inconsistent with our intuition in certain situations [29]. To overcome this issue, motivated by the concepts of the HFS [22] and the multiplicative preference relation [19,20], Xia and Xu [29] used Saaty's asymmetrical 1–9 scale to express the membership degrees rather than the symmetrical 0.1–0.9 scale in the HFS, and then introduced a new concept of the hesitant multiplicative set (HMS) to reflect our intuition more objectively.Definition 2.4[29]Let X be a fixed set, a hesitant multiplicative set (HMS) on X is expressed as a function that when applied to X returns a subset of[1/9,9].To be easily understood, Xia and Xu [29] expressed the HMS by(8)M=x,bM(x)|x∈Xwhere bM(x) is a set of some values in[1/9,9]according to Saaty's ratio scale [19,20], denoting the possible multiplicative membership degrees of the element x∈X to the set M.For convenience, Xia and Xu [29] called b=bM(x) a hesitant multiplicative element (HME) andMˆthe set of all hesitant multiplicative elements (HMEs). Let lbbe the number of values in b. We order the values in b in increasing order, and let bσ(i) be the ith smallest value in b, i.e.,b=bσ(s)s=1,2,…,lb.To rank the HMEs, we define the following comparison laws:For a HMEb=bσ(s)s=1,2,…,lb,s(b)=∏s=1lbbσ(s)1lbis called the score function of b where lbis the number of the elements in b. For two HMEs b1 and b2, if s(b1)>s(b2), then b1>b2; if s(b1)=s(b2) and then b1=b2.LetX={x1,x2,x3},M=x1,16,15,x2,{1,3,4},x3,{7,9}, and b={1, 3, 4}. Then, M is a HMS on X, and b is a HME.In most situations, it is noted that the numbers of elements in two HMEs bi(i=1, 2) are different. To correctly compute or compare b1 and b2, the precondition is to make sure that b1 and b2 have the same number of elements. For two HMEs bi(i=1, 2) with a limited number of elements, we have two principles to normalize them:(1)α-Normalization: Remove some elements of bias it more elements than the other.β-Normalization: Add some elements to bias it has fewer elements than the other.Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a fixed set of alternatives. Assume that the DMs provides all of the possible preference values for each paired comparison judgment of alternatives by using the Saaty scale and that these possible preference values are collected into HMEs. On the basis of HMEs and multiplicative preference relations, Xia and Xu [29] developed the following concept of hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs):Definition 2.6[29]Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a fixed set. A hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) on X is denoted by a matrixB=(bij)n×n⊂X×Xwherebij=bijσ(s)s=1,2,⋯,lbijis a HME indicating all possible multiplicative degrees to which xiis preferred to xj. For all i, j=1, 2, …, n, bijshould satisfy the following conditions:(9)bijσ(s)×bjiσ(lbji−s+1)=1(10)bii={1}(11)lbij=lbjiwhere the elements in bijare assumed to be arranged in increasing order for convenience and letbijσ(s)(s=1,2,…,lbij)denote the sth smallest value in bijandlbijthe number of elements in bij.Eq. (9) indicates that the product of the sth smallest value in bijand the sth largest value in bjishould be equivalent to 1, which is the reciprocal condition. In other words, ifbij=bijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbijare known, then we can determine bji, which is given bybji=1/bijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbij. Eq. (10) indicates that the diagonal elements in B should be equivalent to 1, which implies indifference between xiand xi. Eq. (11) indicates that the number in bijand bjishould be the same.Let B be a HMPR as follows:B=117,16,151,318,275,6,711,27,913,112,111472,819,1741In the real world, however, many decision-making processes occur in multi-person settings because the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the socio-economic environment makes it increasingly less possible for a single decision maker to consider all relevant aspects of a decision-making problem, which is called a GDM. Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in real decision problems as well as the time pressure, the lack of knowledge and the decision maker's limited expertise related to the problem domain, there are many GDM problems wherein the experts evaluate their opinions as HMPRs. We consider a GDM problem with a finite set of alternativesX=x1,x2,…,xn. Assume thatD=d1,d2,…,dmis the set of decision makers (DMs) and the corresponding weight vector is λ=(λ1, λ2, …, λm)Twith∑t=1mλt=1, λt≥0, t=1, 2, …, m. Suppose that the tth DM gives his/her preference information as a HMPRBt=(bij,t)n×n=bij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbij,tn×nwhere bij,tis a HME, which indicates hesitant degrees to which xiis preferred to xj, and satisfies(12)bij,tσ(s)×bji,tσ(lbij,t−s+1)=1,bii,t=1,lbij,t=lbji,twherebij,tσ(s)andbji,tσ(s)are the sth smallest elements in bij,tand bji,t, respectively.Based on the above two normalization principles, we now derive the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision-making environments.We develop a modeling method to derive priorities from HMPRs in GDM based on the α-normalization. Letwi(i=1,2,…,n)be the importance weight of the alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, n), and let all of the weightswiwi(i=1,2,…,n)satisfywi≥0, i=1, 2, …, n, and∑i=1nwi=1. Assume thatBt=(bij,t)n×n=bij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbij,tn×nis a consistent HMPR. As each element in bij,tis a possible preference degree for the comparison of the alternative xiover xj, then by Eq. (3), the consistent preferences can be obtained by(13)wiwj=bij,tσ(1)orbij,tσ(2)or⋯orbij,tσ(lbij,t),i,j=1,2,…,n,t=1,2,…,mwherebij,tσ(s)(s=1,2,…,lbij,t) is the sth smallest element in bij,t.LetS(bij,t)=bij,tσ(1)orbij,tσ(2)or⋯orbij,tσ(lbij,t). Then, by Eq. (13), we obtain(14)wiwj=bij,tσ(1)⁡⁡⁡⁡or⁡⁡⁡⁡bij,tσ(2)⁡⁡⁡⁡or⁡⋯⁡⁡⁡⁡or⁡⁡⁡⁡bij,tσ(lbij,t)⇔wi=wjS(bij,t)Nevertheless, Eq. (14) does not always hold in the actual applications. Thus, we relax Eq. (14) to obtain consistent preferences as much as possible by minimizing the error ɛij,twhere(15)εij,t=wi−wjS(bij,t),i,j=1,2,…,n,t=1,2,…,mTo derive the weightswi(i=1,2,…,n)of the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n), all Bt(t=1, 2, …, m) should be integrated, and thus, based on Eq. (15), we establish the optimization problem:(16)min∑t=1mλt∑i=1n∑j=1,i≠jnεij,t=∑t=1mλt∑i=1n∑j=1,i≠jnwi−wjS(bij,t)s.t.wi≥0,i=1,2,…,n,∑i=1nwi=1The solution to the above minimization problem is found by solving the following goal programming model:(17)minJ=∑t=1mλt∑i=1n∑j=1,i≠jnsij,tdij,t++tij,tdij,t−s.t.wi−wjS(bij,t)−sij,tdij,t++tij,tdij,t−=0,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,t=1,2,…,m,wi≥0,i=1,2,…,n,∑i=1nwi=1,dij,t+,dij,t−≥0,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,t=1,2,…,mwheredij,t+is the positive deviation from the target of the goal ɛij,tand is defined as(18)dij,t+=maxwi−wjS(bij,t),0dij,t−is the negative deviation from the target of the goal ɛij,tand is defined asdij,t−=maxwjS(bij,t)−wi,0sij,tis the weighting factor corresponding to the positive deviationdij,t+, and tij,tis the weighting factor corresponding to the negative deviationdij,t−.Consider that all of the goal functions ɛij,t(i, j=1, 2, …, n, t=1, 2, …, m) are fair. Thus, we set sij,t=tij,t=1 (i, j=1, 2, …, n, t=1, 2, …, m) and then rewrite Eq. (17) as(19)minJ=∑t=1mλt∑i=1n∑j=1,i≠jndij,t++dij,t−s.t.wi−wjSbij,t−dij,t++dij,t−=0,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,t=1,2,…,m,wi≥0,i=1,2,…,n,∑i=1nwi=1,dij,t+,dij,t−≥0,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,t=1,2,…,mSolving this model is a selection process in that it selects the optimal preference from all possible preferences for each paired comparison of alternatives until we obtain all optimal preferences. These optimal preferences make up a multiplicative preference relation, which is called the reduction of the original HMPR.The following is a numerical example that illustrates the above goal programming model.Example 3.1Consider a GDM problem with four alternativesX=x1,x2,x3,x4and three decision makersD=d1,d2,d3. The corresponding weight vector isλ=0.5,0.2,0.3. Each decision maker provides his/her hesitant preferences over paired comparisons of these four decision alternatives according to Saaty's ratio scale and constructs the following HMPR Bt(t=1, 2, 3), respectively:B1=117,152,5,619,17,155,715,6,7316,15,1217,16,15118,175,7,9137,81B2=118,16,157,815,135,6,817,8,91218,1719,18,17114,13,123,522,3,41B3=117,16,151,318,375,6,711,27,813,112,111473,818,1741To derive the priority weights of alternatives, according to Eq. (19), we obtain the results as follows:w1=0.1250,w2=0.6250,w3=0.0417,w4=0.2083Asw2>w4>w1>w3, the ranking of alternatives is x2>x4>x1>x3, and the optimal alternative is x2.Furthermore, we obtain three corresponding multiplicative preference relations A1, A2, and A3 consisting of the optimal preference values as follows:A1=1175157163151611851381,A2=1167136181217181143241,A3=1171377127112114731741These can be considered as three reductions of B1, B2, and B3, respectively.Based on the α-normalization, HMPRs can be reduced to multiplicative preference relations by removing some preferences. However, according to the β-normalization, we add some elements to the HMEs.The β-normalization is a principle that aims to equalize the number of elements in the HMEs of a HMPR. In this section, the β-normalization principle is used to define consistent and acceptably consistent HMPRs. Moreover, the properties of consistent and acceptably consistent HMPRs are studied in detail. A convex combination method is then developed to derive priorities from HMPRs with the β-normalization.Similar to Zhu et al. [50], we introduce a method to add elements to HMEs based on the β-normalization.Definition 4.1Assume a HME,b=bσ(s)s=1,2,⋯,lb. Let b+ and b− be the maximum and minimum elements in b, respectively, and ς (0≤ς≤1) be an optimized parameter. We callb¯=b+ς×b−1−ςan added element.In the above definition, the optimized parameter ς is provided by the DMs according to their risk preferences. When ς=1 and ς=0, we obtainb¯=b+andb¯=b−, which correspond with the optimism and pessimism rules that are adopted by the DMs. That is, the optimists anticipate desirable outcomes and may add the maximum membership degree, while the pessimists expect unfavorable outcomes and may add the minimum membership degree.Based on Definition 4.1, we use the optimized parameter ς to add some elements to an HMPR and obtain a normalized hesitant multiplicative preference relation (NHMPR) defined as follows:Assume a HMPR,B=(bij)n×nand an optimized parameter ς (0≤ς≤1) where ς is used to add some elements to bij(i<j) and 1−ς is used to add some elements to bji(i<j) to obtain a HMPRB¯=(b¯ij)n×n. For all i, j=1, 2, ⋯, n, this preference relation should satisfy the following conditions:(20)lb¯ij=maxlbiji,j=1,2,⋯,n,i≠j,b¯ijσ(s)×b¯jiσ(lb¯ij−s+1)=1,b¯ii=1whereb¯ijσ(s)andb¯jiσ(s)are the sth smallest elements inb¯ijandb¯ji, respectively. Then,B¯=(b¯ij)n×nis a normalized hesitant multiplicative preference relation (NHMPR) with the optimized parameter ς, andb¯ijis a normalized hesitant multiplicative element (NHME).Let B be a HMPR given in Example 2.2. According to Definition 4.1, let ς=1. The resulting NHMPRB¯isB¯=117,16,151,3,318,27,275,6,711,2,27,9,913,13,112,12,1114,14,1472,72,819,19,174,4,41We focus on the definition of consistent HMPRs. It is convenient to construct l (l=maxlbiji,j=1,2,⋯,n,i≠j) multiplicative preference relationsA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) from a HMPRB=(bij)n×n=bijσ(s)s=1,2,⋯,lbijn×n.LetB=(bij)n×n=bijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbijn×nbe a HMPR andB¯=(b¯ij)n×n=b¯ijσ(s)s=1,2,…,ln×n(l=maxlbiji,j=1,2,⋯,n,i≠j) be its NHMPR with the optimized parameter ς. LetA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) where(21)aij(s)=h¯ijσ(s),i<j1i=jh¯ijσ(l−s+1),i>j,i,j=1,2,⋯,n,s=1,2,⋯,lFrom Definition 4.2,A(s)=aij(s)n×nare l multiplicative preference relations.It is also supposed that(22)D(α)=(dij(α))n×n=∏s=1laij(s)αsn×nwhereα∈L=(α1,α2,…,αl)Tαs≥0,s=1,2,⋯,l,∑s=1lαs=1. From Eq. (22), we find that every element of D(α) is a geometric combination of the corresponding elements inA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l). It is also noted that D(α)=A(s) whenα=0,⋯,0︸s−1,1,0,⋯,0︸l−s. Moreover,dij(α)×dji(α)=∏s=1laij(s)αs×∏s=1laji(s)αs=∏s=1laij(s)×aji(s)αs=1for all i, j=1, 2, ⋯, n. Thus, D(α) is a multiplicative preference relation for ∀α∈L.A definition of consistent HMPRs is as follows.LetB=(bij)n×nbe a HMPR andB¯=(b¯ij)n×nbe its NHMPR with the optimized parameter ς. If l multiplicative preference relationsA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l) constructed using Eq. (21) are consistent, then B is a consistent HMPR. Otherwise, B is determined to be inconsistent.As evidenced in Definition 4.3, a consistent HMPR can be reduced to a consistent multiplicative preference relation when all HMEs become real numbers. From Definition 4.3, to verify whether B is consistent, it is sufficient to check the consistency ofA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l). When allA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) are consistent, B is consistent. When one ofA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) is not consistent, B is not consistent.The properties of consistent HMPRs are as follows.IfB=(bij)n×nis a consistent HMPR with ς, thenB′=(b′ij)(n−1)×(n−1), which is constructed by eliminating the ith row and ith column inB=(bij)n×n, is consistent with ς.The proof directly follows from Definition 4.3. □Theorem 4.1 shows that the consistency of HMPRs is robust.Theorem 4.2For a consistent HMPRB=(bij)n×n=bijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbijn×nwith ς, letBc=bijcn×n=1bijσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbijn×n. Bcis then a consistent HMPR with 1−ς.AsB=(bij)n×nis consistent with ς, we have(23)b¯ijσ(s)=bij+ς×bij−1−ς,i<jand(24)b¯jiσ(lbij−s+1)=1b¯ijσ(s)=1bij+ς×bij−1−ς=1bij+ς×1bij−1−ς=bji−ς×bji+1−ςi<jwherebij+andbij−are the maximum and minimum elements in bij, respectively.According to Eq. (23), for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, and i<j, then(25)b¯ijσ(s)c=bij+ς×bij−1−ςc=1bji−ς×1bji+1−ςc=bji−ς×bji+1−ς=b¯jiσlbij−s+1i<jSimilarly,(26)b¯jiσ(s)c=bji−ς×bji+1−ςc=1bij+ς×1bij−1−ςc=bij+ς×bij−1−ς=b¯ijσlbij−s+1i<jAsb¯ijσ(s)c=b¯jiσlbij−s+1,b¯jiσ(s)c=b¯ijσlbij−s+1, andB=(bij)n×nis a consistent HMPR with ς, thenBc=bijcn×nis a consistent HMPR with 1−ς. □B is consistent if and only if D(α) is consistent for any α∈L.Suppose D(α) are consistent for ∀α∈L. Then,D(α)=D0,…,0︸s−1,1,0,…,0︸l−s=A(s)are consistent for ∀s=1, 2, …, l. From Definition 4.3, we determine that B is consistent.Conversely, suppose that B is consistent. By Definition 4.3, we find that A(s) (∀s=1, 2, …, l) are consistent. That is,aij(s)=aik(s)akj(s), for all i, j, k=1, 2, …, n and s=1, 2, …, l.According to Eq. (22),dij(α)=∏s=1laij(s)αs=∏s=1laik(s)akj(s)αs=∏s=1laik(s)αs×∏s=1lakj(s)αs=dik(α)⋅dkj(α)where ∀α∈L, for all i, j, k=1, 2, …, n. From Definition 2.2, D(α) is consistent for ∀α∈L. Thus, the theorem has been proven. □According to Theorem 4.3, when B is a consistent HMPR, a family of consistent multiplicative preference relations D(α) from B, using Eqs. (21) and (22), are obtained for all α∈L.To make the weights generated from B reliable, the consistency study of B is important. However, in most cases, it is unrealistic to expect a HMPR to be perfectly consistent because the DMs would be affected by many uncertainties. Consequently, we focus on the acceptable consistency of HMPRs and give the following definition.LetB=(bij)n×nbe a HMPR andB¯=(b¯ij)n×nbe its NHMPR with the optimized parameter ς. If l multiplicative preference relationsA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l) given by Eq. (21) are all of acceptable consistency, then B is said to be an acceptably consistent HMPR. Otherwise, B is said to be unacceptably consistent.From Definition 4.4, it is evidenced that an acceptably consistent HMPR can be reduced to an acceptably consistent multiplicative preference relation when the HMEs become real numbers. To verify whether B is acceptably consistent, it is sufficient to check the acceptable consistency of A(s) (s=1, 2, …, l). When allA(s)=aij(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l) are acceptably consistent, B is acceptably consistent. When one of A(s) (s=1, 2, …, l) is not acceptably consistent, B is unacceptably consistent. Moreover, a matrix B with unacceptable consistency can be easily adjusted to that with acceptable consistency by modifying A(s) (s=1, 2, …, l).B is acceptably consistent if and only ifDα(α∈L) are acceptably consistent.It is determined from Eq. (22) thatAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) are acceptably consistent whenDαare of acceptable consistency for α∈L, indicating that B has acceptable consistency by Definition 4.4.Conversely, suppose B is acceptably consistent. That is,As(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) have acceptable consistency. LetλmaxAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) be the greatest eigenvalues ofAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l), respectively. From Eq. (4),λmaxAs−nn−1RI<0.10,s=1,2,⋯,l,Using Theorem 2.1,λmaxDα−nn−1RI<0.10,whereλmaxDαare the greatest eigenvalues ofDα. Then,Dαis of acceptable consistency. □As observed in Theorem 4.4, when B is an acceptably consistent HMPR, a family of multiplicative preference relationsDαwith acceptable consistency is obtained.To generate the priority weights from HMPR B, we introduce a convex combination method. When a HMPR is consistent by Definition 4.3, the derived weights are consistent. In most cases, a HMPR B has no consistency. That is, it is inconsistent for multiplicative preference relationsAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l), or unacceptably consistent. Given Definition 4.4, a HMPR with unacceptable consistency can be modified such that it is acceptably consistent. When a HMPR is acceptably consistent according to Definition 4.4, it is reasonable to consider the derived weights to be acceptably reliable. In what follows, only the weights generated from acceptably consistent HMPRs are considered. On the other hand, in the case of HMPRs, it is considered that interval weights should be more logical and natural than an exact priority vector to represent partial or complete imprecision of the DM's hesitant judgments. Consequently, interval weights derived from acceptably consistent HMPRs are determined.To achieve the interval weights, it is convenient to investigate the weights of multiplicative preference relationsDα(α∈L) with acceptable consistency by considering Theorem 4.4. Let us suppose that the weightswiαofDαsatisfy∏i=1nwiα=1, and the weightswiAsofAssatisfy∏i=1nwiRs=1. The geometric mean (GM) method [2,4,11] is used to obtain the weights from the matricesDαandAs, respectively, i.e.,(27)wiα=∏j=1ndijα1/nand(28)wiAs=∏j=1naijs1/nwhere i=1, 2, ⋯, n, s=1, 2, ⋯, l, and α∈L.The relationships betweenwiαandwiAsare presented in the following theorem:Theorem 4.5IfwαandwAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) are the weight vectors ofDαandAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l), respectively, defined by Eqs. (27) and (28), then(29)wiα=∏s=1lwiAsαs,i=1,2,⋯,nwhereα=α1,α2,⋯,αlT,∑s=1lαs=1,wα=w1α,w2α,⋯,wnαT,∏i=1nwiα=1,wAs=w1As,w2As,⋯,wnAs, and∏i=1nwiAs=1, s=1, 2, ⋯, l.By Eqs. (27) and (28),wiα=∏j=1ndijα1/n=∏j=1n∏s=1laijsαs1/n=∏s=1l∏j=1naijs1/nαs=∏s=1lwiAsαsThus, the proof is complete. □Furthermore, to obtain the synthetic priority ofB=bijn×n, the weight functionswiα(α∈L) derived fromDαare further aggregated as the following interval numbers:(30)wi=minwiαα∈L,maxwiαα∈L,i=1,2,⋯,nTheorem 4.6Letwi(i=1, 2, ⋯, n) be given by Eq.(30). Eq.(30)can then be equivalently rewritten as(31)wi=minwiAss=1,2,⋯,l,maxwiAss=1,2,⋯,l,i=1,2,⋯,nLetmaxwiAss=1,2,⋯,l=wiAp. Then, by Eqs. (5) and (29),wiα=∏s=1lwiAsαs≤∑s=1lαs⋅wiAs≤∑s=1lαs⋅wiAp=wiApLetα=0,⋯,0︸p−1,1,0,⋯,0︸l−p. Then,wiα=∏s=1lwiAsαs=wiAp, and thus,maxwiαα∈L=wiAp=maxwiAss=1,2,⋯,lIn addition, letminwiA(s)s=1,2,⋯,l=wiA(q). Then, by Eq. (29),wiα=∏s=1lwiA(q)αs≥∏s=1lwiA(q)αs=wiA(q)∑s=1lαs=wiA(q)Letα=0,⋯,0︸q−1,1,0,⋯,0︸l−q. Then,wiα=∏s=1lwiAsαs=wiAq, and thus,minwiαα∈L=wiAq=minwiAss=1,2,⋯,lBased on the above analysis, we conclude thatwi=minwiαα∈L,maxwiαα∈L=minwiAss=1,2,⋯,l,maxwiAss=1,2,⋯,lThus, the proof is complete. □In what follows, a new algorithm for generating the weights from an acceptably consistent HMPR is proposed.Algorithm 1Step 1.Consider a decision-making problem with a finite set of alternatives X={x1, x2, ⋯, xn}. The DM gives his/her preference information for X by means of a HMPRB=bijn×n.Step 2. Use Definition 4.2 to obtain a normalized HMPRB¯=b¯ijn×nfromB=bijn×n.Step 3. Use Eq. (21) to construct the multiplicative preference relationsAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) fromB¯=b¯ijn×n.Step 4. Acceptable consistency ofAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) is checked. According to the method proposed by Xu and Wei [40], any ofAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l) with CR≥0.10 is adjusted such that it demonstrates acceptable consistency (i.e., CR<0.10).Step 5. Use Eq. (28) to obtain the weight vectors ofAs(s=1, 2, ⋯, l).Step 6. From Eq. (31), an interval weight vector of B is obtained.Step 7. To rank these interval weightswi=wi−,wi+(i=1, 2, ⋯, n), we first compare eachwiwith all of thewj(j=1, 2, ⋯, n) and then compute the degree of possibility ofwi≥wj[38,39]:(32)pwi≥wj=max1−maxwj+−wi−wi+−wi−+wj+−wj−,0,0That is,wiis superior towjto the degree ofpwi≥wjas denoted bywi≻pwi≥wjwj.For simplicity, we letpij=pwi≥wj. We then develop a complementary matrix forP=pijm×mas follows:P=p11p12⋯p1np21p22⋯p2n⋮⋮⋮⋮pn1pn2⋯pnnwhere pij≥0, pij+pji=1,pii=12, i, j=1, 2, ⋯, n.Summing all elements in each line of the matrix P, we have(33)pi=∑j=1npij,i=1,2,⋯,nWe then rank these interval weightswi=wi−,wi+(i=1, 2, ⋯, n) in descending order in accordance with the values pi(i=1, 2, ⋯, n).Step 8. End.Let B be a HMPR given in Example 2.2 and let ς=1. Suppose three change parametersμAˆ1=0.91,μAˆ2=0.95, andμAˆ3=0.98. By Algorithm 1, we obtain the interval weight vector of B,wB=0.3404,0.6185,2.7600,3.2789,0.4677,0.7418,1.0911,1.4346Thus, by Eq. (32), the ranking of the four alternatives is as follows:x2≻1.0000x4≻1.0000x3≻0.7270x1which indicates that x2 is superior to x4 to the degree of 100%, x4 is superior to x3 to the degree of 100%, and x3 is superior to x1 to the degree of 72.70%.Using Definition 4.1, we first transform all individual HMPRsBt=bij,tn×n=bij,tσss=1,2,⋯,lbij,tn×n(t=1, 2, ⋯, m) into their normalized HMPRs (NHMPRs)B¯t=b¯ij,tn×n=b¯ij,tσss=1,2,⋯,ln×nwith ς, thus satisfying the following conditions:(34)l=maxlbij,ti,j=1,2,⋯,n,i≠j,t=1,2,⋯,mb¯ij,tσs×b¯ji,tσl−s+1=1b¯ii,t=0.5whereb¯ij,tσsandb¯ji,tσsare the sth smallest elements inb¯ij,tandb¯ji,t, respectively.A collective HMPRBc=bij,cn×ncan be derived from all of the individual HMPRsBt=bij,tn×n(t=1, 2, ⋯, m) by applying the hesitant multiplicative weighted geometric (HMWG) operator,(35)bij,cσs=∏t=1mb¯ij,tσsλt(i,j=1,2,⋯,n,s=1,2,⋯,l)Theorem 4.7LetBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1, 2…, m) be m HMPRs, letB¯t=(b¯ij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)be their NHMPRs with ς, and letλt∈0,1, t=1, 2, …, m,∑t=1mλt=1. LetBc=(bij,c)n×nbe constructed through Eq.(35). Then, Bcis a HMPR.According to Eq. (35), for all i, j=1, 2, …, n,bij,cσ(s)×bji,cσ(l−s+1)=∏t=1mb¯ij,tσ(s)λt×∏t=1mb¯ji,tσ(l−s+1)λt=∏t=1mb¯ij,tσ(s)×b¯ji,tσ(l−s+1)λt=1In addition, applyingb¯ij,tσ(s)≤b¯ij,tσ(s+1)for all t=1, 2, …, m and s=1, 2, …, l−1, we find thatbij,cσ(s)=∏t=1mb¯ij,tσ(s)λt≤∏t=1mb¯ij,tσ(s+1)λt=bij,cσ(s+1)Thus, Bcis a HMPR, which completes the proof of Theorem 4.7. □IfBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)are all consistent HMPRs, then their collective HFPRBc=(bij,c)n×nconstructed through Eq.(35)is consistent, where λt≥0, t=1, 2, …, m, and∑t=1mλt=1.Assume thatAt(s)=aij,t(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l, t=1, 2, …, m) together withAcs=aij,csn×n(s=1, 2, …, l) are determined by using Eq. (21) fromBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)andBc=(bij,c)n×n, respectively. According to Definition 4.3, ifBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1, 2…, m) is consistent, thenAt(s)=aij,t(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l, t=1, 2, …, m) are consistent. Applying Eqs. (2) and (35), it follows thataij,cs=∏t=1maij,tsλt=∏t=1maik,ts×akj,tsλt=∏t=1maik,tsλt×∏t=1makj,tsλt=aik,cs×akj,csUsing Definition 4.3, Bcconstructed through Eq. (35) is consistent. □For Bcto be consistent, Theorem 4.8 shows that Bt(t=1, 2…, m) should be consistent, which is an ideal case. Therefore we focus on the acceptable consistency of Bc.Bc=(bij,c)n×nconstructed through Eq.(35)is acceptably consistent if HMPRBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)is of acceptable consistency and λt≥0, t=1, 2, …, m,∑t=1mλt=1.LetλmaxAts(t=1, 2…, m, s=1, 2…, l), and letλmaxAcs(t=1, 2…, m, s=1, 2…, l) be the corresponding greatest eigenvalues ofAt(s)=aij,t(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l, t=1, 2, …, m) andAc(s)=aij,c(s)n×n(s=1, 2, …, l), which are constructed by using Eq. (21) fromBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)andBc=(bij,c)n×n, respectively. According to Eqs. (21) and (35),aij,c(s)=∏t=1maij,t(s)λt. BecauseBt=(bij,t)n×n(t=1,2…,m)is acceptably consistent, the application of Eq. (4) and Definition 4.4 leads toλmaxAts−nn−1RI<0.10,t=1,2…,m,s=1,2,…,lThen, using Theorem 2.1,λmaxAcs−nn−1RI<0.10, s=1, 2, …, l, From Definition 4.4, it is found thatBc=(bij,c)n×nis acceptably consistent. □Furthermore, a new algorithm for generating a solution of a GDM problem with several HMPRs is presented as follows:Step 1. Consider a GDM problem with a finite set of alternatives X={x1, x2, …, xn} and a group of decision makersD=d1,d2,…,dm. Suppose that the tth decision maker dtgives his/her preference information by means of a HMPRBt=(bij,t)n×n=bij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbij,tn×n(t=1, 2, …, m).Step 2. Use Eq. (34) to obtain normalized HMPRsB¯t=(b¯ij,t)n×n=b¯ij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,ln×n(t=1,2,…,m)fromBt=(bij,t)n×n=bij,tσ(s)s=1,2,…,lbij,tn×n(t=1,2,…,m).Step 3. By Definition 4.4, acceptable consistency ofB¯t(t=1,2,…,m)is checked. Any ofB¯twith unacceptable consistency is adjusted such that it demonstrates acceptable consistency (see Steps 3 and 4 in Algorithm 1).Step 4. Using Eq. (35) and Theorem 4.9, the collective HMPRBc=(bij,c)n×nwith acceptable consistency is obtained.Step 5. According to Eq. (31), an interval weight vector of Bcis obtained.Step 6. Rank these interval weightswi=[wi−,wi+](i=1,2,…,n)(see Step 7 in Algorithm 1).Step 7. End.Finally, we offer another numerical example to illustrate the above algorithm for obtaining a solution of a GDM problem with HMPRs.Let Bt(t=1, 2, 3) be the three HMPRs given in Example 3.1, and let ς1=0, ς2=1, and ς3=1. Then, by Algorithm 2, the interval priority vector of the collective HMPR BciswBc=0.4320,0.7261,2.8682,3.0182,0.3074,0.4065,1.5474,1.9855Thus, by Eq. (32), the ranking of the four alternatives is obtained such thatx2≻1.0000x4≻1.0000x1≻1.0000x3which indicates that x2 is superior to x4 to the degree of 100%, x4 is superior to x1 to the degree of 100%, and x1 is superior to x3 to the degree of 100%.According to Examples 3.1 and 4.3, the ranking of alternatives obtained on the basis of the α-normalization principle is the same as the ranking obtained on the basis of the β-normalization principle. It is concluded that the advantage of using the α-normalization to address HMPRs is that it not only directly yields the priority weights of alternatives, but it also reduces HMPRs to multiplicative preference relations consisting of all optimal preferences. The advantage of using the β-normalization to address HMPRs is that it does not need to solve any mathematical programming or complicated algebraic operations, and all preferences provided by the decision group can be taken into account. Therefore, if we aim to select the optimal preference from all possible preferences, the α-normalization is reasonable; if we want to consider all possible preferences provided by the decision group, then the β-normalization is preferable.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have developed a hesitant multiplicative goal programming model and a convex combination method to derive the priority weights from HMPRs in group decision-making environments. First, a hesitant multiplicative goal programming model is developed using the α-normalization principle to identify the optimal preferences for each paired comparison of alternatives in HMPRs. The solution of this new model not only directly yields the priority weights of alternatives, but it also reduces HMPRs to multiplicative preference relations consisting of all optimal preferences. Based on a principle of the β-normalization, an acceptably consistent HMPR is defined, which can be reduced to an acceptably consistent multiplicative preference relation when the HMEs become exact numbers. Furthermore, HMPRs with unacceptable consistency can be easily modified to HMPRs with acceptable consistency. Making use of a convex combination method, a family of multiplicative preference relations with acceptable consistency can be obtained from an acceptably consistent HMPR whose weights are a form of a convex combination. An interval weight generation method is also used to obtain interval weights from an acceptably consistent HMPR. The developed method is further applied to group decision making (GDM) where the experts offer their judgments with respect to several HMPRs. A hesitant multiplicative weighted geometric (HMWG) operator is proposed to integrate individual HMPRs into one collective HMPR. Acceptable consistency analysis of the collective HMPR has been conducted, and it has been determined that when all individual HMPRs are consistent or acceptably consistent, the collective HMPR is also consistent or acceptably consistent. A practical algorithm for obtaining the interval weights from several HMPRs in GDM environments has also been proposed. Finally, the practicality and effectiveness of the developed approaches have been verified using several illustrative examples.
